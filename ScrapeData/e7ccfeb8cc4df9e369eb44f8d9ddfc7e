Vyasa said :-- O Noble minded one! The king Yudhajit replied to the\naddress of the king of Keral, thus :--\n\n\n\n2-3. O King! You are truthful and have restrained your passions. What you have\ntold just now in this assembly of kings is all correct and approved by\nmorality. O best of the kings! You are born of a high family; you better say\nhow can this take place that when so many fit persons are present here to\nbecome the bridegroom, can an unworthy person take away the offer?\n\n\n\np. 200\n\n\n\n4\\. As a jackal never becomes fit to enjoy what are the dues of a lion, so\nthis Sudars\xc2\x92ana is also unfit to acquire this bride elect.\n\n\n\n5\\. The Brahma _n_ as have the Vedas as their strength; the K _s_ attriya\nkings take bows and arrows to be their source of strength; this is ordained\neverywhere. Therefore O King! What wrong have I done in my statement. Kindly\nexplain.\n\n\n\n6-7. The power of the kings is the befitting money given to the parents of a\nbride; according to this, the strongest man is to acquire the bride, a jewel.\nThe K _s_ attriyas that are weak can never acquire that. Make this the rule in\nthis marriage. This earth is fit to be enjoyed by the heroes only and not by\nthe cowards and intriguing persons. Otherwise quarrels are sure to ensue\namongst the kings.\n\n\n\n8\\. The dispute thus arose in that Svayamvara hall; and the king Subahu was\ncalled in.\n\n\n\n9\\. The kings that could see the reality of things then addressed the king\nSubahu. \xc2\x93O king! You are requested to establish a golden rule in this marriage\nceremony.\n\n\n\n10\\. What is your object in calling this Svayamvara. Better give it out after\na mature consideration. Please be explicit whom have you intended to give over\nyour daughter in this marriage?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n11-12. Subahu said :-- \xc2\x93My daughter has mentally selected Sudars\xc2\x92ana; I\nprevented her repeatedly from doing this; but she did not accept my word. What\nshall I do now? The mind of my daughter now is not at her will. Sudars\xc2\x92ana,\ntoo, though uninvited, has come here singly and is residing calmly, without\nany signs of disturbance in his mind.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n13-14. Vyasa said :-- Then the chief kings all invited Sudars\xc2\x92ana there;\nSudars\xc2\x92ana, too, came there quietly, and the princes, seeing his quiet nature,\nasked him, \xc2\x93O one, engaged in practising vows! Who has invited you here? Why\nhave you come here singly, in this assembly of kings?\n\n\n\n15\\. You have no force, no ministers, no help, no wealth, and no army. O\nintelligent! Then explain why have you come here alone?\n\n\n\n16\\. In this assembly of kings you see that the powerful monarchs are ready to\nfight with each other for the sake of this princess. What do you intend to do\nunder those circumstances?\n\n\n\n17\\. Your brother, too, is come here to have the princess; he has got his army\nand is also marked with his strength and valor. The powerful Yudhajit has come\nhere also to help him.\n\n\n\n18\\. O observer of good vows! Seeing you without any army, we have narrated to\nyou all the facts. Now think and do accordingly. If you please, remain here or\ngo anywhere else.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 201\n\n\n\n19-20. Sudars\xc2\x92ana replied :-- \xc2\x93True, I have no army, no help, no wealth, no\nforts, no friends or no kings to protect me. Hearing that Svayamvara will be\nheld here, I have come here to witness it. But there is one particularity\nhere; it is this :-- The Devi Bhagavati has ordered me in my dream to come\nhere. Under Her command I have come here; there is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n21\\. I have got no other object in view; I have obeyed what the Bhagavati\nBhuvanes\xc2\x92vari has ordered me to do. Today will happen, no doubt, what She has\nordained.\n\n\n\n22-23. O kings! I am seeing everywhere the Supreme Goddess Bhagavati Bhavani.\nTherefore there is no enemy of mine in this world; but he who will turn out an\nenemy of mine, will be duly punished by the Maha Vidya Maha Maya. I do not\nknow what is enmity?\n\n\n\n24\\. O kings! What is inevitable will surely come to pass. There will be\nnothing otherwise. I am always depending on Fate, Destiny. What is the use,\nthen, in thinking what will be the result?\n\n\n\n25\\. Everywhere in the Devas, in the spirits, in men, in all the beings, the\nDevi\xc2\x92s power is existent; it cannot be otherwise.\n\n\n\n26\\. O kings! Whenever She wishes, She makes kings, masters of wealth or\ndevoid of wealth. What is, then, the use of bothering my head in this?\n\n\n\n27\\. When even the Gods Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, and Mahes\xc2\x92a without Her presence,\nbecome powerless enough to move their hands or feet, then why shall I be\nanxious for the result?\n\n\n\n28\\. O kings! Whether I am unable or able or an ordinary person, you have\nnothing to consider; I have come here in this assembly hall under the command\nof the Supreme Bhagavati.\n\n\n\n29-30. What She has willed, She will do that. I am not to care for that. O\nhigh minded ones! You need not be afraid at all in this. I have told you all\ntruth. Victory or defeat, I feel no shame in either of them. For I am always\nunder the control of Bhagavati; therefore if there be any shame here, it is\nall Hers.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n31-33. Vyasa said :-- Hearing thus his words, and seeing that his mind is\nfirmly devoted to Bhagavati, the kings saw each other and said thus :-- \xc2\x93O\nSudars\xc2\x92ana! What you have said is quite true; it is never otherwise; still\nYudhajit, the king of Ujjain is intent on killing you. O intelligent! O\nsinless! we have all come to know that there is no trace of evil in you. We\nwere all overcome with pity for you; hence we have informed you; now think and\ndo the needful?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 202\n\n\n\n34\\. Sudars\xc2\x92ana said, \xc2\x93You are all kind and large hearted; what you all have\nsaid is quite true. What shall I tell you, being a minor as yet!\n\n\n\n35\\. O kings! No one can cause the death of another. All this world, moving\nand unmoving, is under the control of Fate.\n\n\n\n36-38. No soul is independent; every one is under the effects of one\xc2\x92s own\nKarma. The Pundits that have realised the Truth, say that Karma is of three\nkinds, Accumulated, Present, and Prarabdha? This whole world is due to Kala\n(Time), Karma (action) and Svabhava (Nature); unless the proper time comes,\neven the Devas cannot kill men. The men are killed on account of some cause,\nimmediate; but the Great Time is the real Destroyer.\n\n\n\n39\\. My father, though a destroyer of many others, was himself killed by a\nlion and my mother\xc2\x92s father was slain by Yudhajit in the battle.\n\n\n\n40\\. The Jivas, though caring hard to preserve their lives, are killed by Fate\nin spite of all their cares; and they live thousand years though there is none\nto protect them.\n\n\n\n41\\. O religious kings! I do not fear a bit from Yudhajit. I consider Fate as\nthe Supreme and I therefore remain always undisturbed, calm and quiet.\n\n\n\n42\\. Daily and constantly I remember Bhagavati, Who is the Mother of all this\nUniverse. She will look after my welfare.\n\n\n\n43\\. Behold! One will have certainly to bear the burden of one\xc2\x92s past Karma,\nwhether it be good or it be bad; one\xc2\x92s own actions must bear their fruits.\nThen why shall he be sorry, who has come to know this?\n\n\n\n44\\. The less intelligent deluded persons, on getting pain from their own\nactions, turn out enemies on very trifling matters.\n\n\n\n45\\. I do not grieve nor do I fear on account of such enemies. I am staying\nhere in this assembly of kings, cool-minded.\n\n\n\n46\\. Under the order of Chandika, I have come here to see this Svayamvara;\nwhatever is inevitable will surely come to pass.\n\n\n\n47\\. The words of the Bhagavati are the best proof; I do not know any other.\nMy mind is entirely given up to Her. There will be nothing otherwise than what\nShe has ordained; whether it is good or whether it is bad.\n\n\n\n48\\. O kings! Let Yudhajit remain in peace. I have no enmity with him. He, who\nwill deal inimically with me, will certainly reap his reward. There is not the\nleast doubt in this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 203\n\n\n\n49\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! When Sudars\xc2\x92ana addressed them thus, all the kings\nbecame very glad and they all remained there for the Svayamvara. Sudars\xc2\x92ana,\ntoo, went to his camp and remained also calm and quiet.\n\n\n\n50\\. Next day the king Subahu invited all the kings present in his city to\ntheir respective seats in the Svayamvara hall.\n\n\n\n51\\. The princes and kings, decorated with best ornaments, came and took their\nseats on their respective platforms, covered with valuable carpets of best\nworkmanship.\n\n\n\n52\\. The kings then looked like the celestial Devas, wearing divine ornaments\nand apparels, blazing with the lustrous light of gems, and remained to see the\nSvayamvara affair.\n\n\n\n53\\. Every one there had this foremost thought in his mind when will the\nprincess, the bride elect, would come there; and who will be the man so\nfortunate as to be blessed with garlands offered by her (as a token of\nselection of the bridegroom)!\n\n\n\n54\\. If, accidentally, she offers the garland to Sudars\xc2\x92ana in this Svayamvara\nassembly, then will ensue, no doubt, desperate struggles amongst the kings.\n\n\n\n55\\. While they were thus meditating, sounds of drums were loudly sounded.\n\n\n\n56-58. Then Subahu, the king of Benares, went to her daughter and found that\nS\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala had just taken her bath and put on her silken clothes, and adorned\nherself with various ornaments and sweet garlands. Thus, dressed in complete\nmarriage dress, she began to shine like another Goddess Lak _s_ mi, the\nGoddess of wealth. The king, on seeing his daughter dressed in silken cloth,\nafflicted with anxious thoughts, just smiled and said, \xc2\x93Child! Rise and take\nthe beautiful garlands by your hands and go to the the Svayamvara hall and\njust look at the assembly of kings.\n\n\n\n59\\. O lean bodied one! Whoever, well-qualified, beautiful, and of noble\nbirth, amongst the kings is reigning in your mind, better select him.\n\n\n\n60\\. O graceful! The kings from various quarters are adorning their respective\nseats; better go and see and select whomever you like.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n61\\. Vyasa said :-- When Subahu had spoken thus, S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala, who generally\ntalked little, replied with sweet sonorous words, impregnated with religious\ntruth.\n\n\n\n62\\. \xc2\x93Father! I won\xc2\x92t go before the kings who are inspired by lust; women like\nme never go there; it is those that are dissolute that attend those places.\n\n\n\np. 204\n\n\n\n63\\. Father! I have heard from the religious texts that women should cast\ntheir glances on their husbands only and not on any other.\n\n\n\n64\\. The woman that goes to many persons is mentally claimed by all; each of\nthem contemplates strongly \xc2\x93Let this woman be mine.\xc2\x94 Thus her chastity is\ndestroyed.\n\n\n\n65-66. Desirous of selecting her husband, when the woman holding in her hands,\nthe garland for her would-be-husband, goes to the Svayamvara hall, then she\nturns out like an ordinary unchaste woman. As a prostitute going to a public\nshop looks on many persons and judges of their merits and demerits according\nto her own power of judgment, the maid that goes in the Svayamvara hall does\nexactly the same.\n\n\n\n67\\. How can I behave myself in the hall of the assembly of kings like a\nprostitute, who does not attach her feelings firmly on a single individual but\nglances constantly at many lustful persons.\n\n\n\n68\\. Though this system of Svayamvara is approved by the elderly persons, I am\nnot going to follow that now. I will take the vow of a chaste woman and act up\nto that doctrine as perfectly.\n\n\n\n69\\. I will never be able to act like an ordinary woman going in the\nSvayamvara hall, mentally determining many and finally selecting one.\n\n\n\n70\\. Father! From the very beginning I have given myself up to Sudars\xc2\x92ana in\nmind, word and deed. I have not the least inclination to leave him and select\nanother in his stead.\n\n\n\n71\\. O King! If you want to have my welfare, then give your daughter on an\nauspicious day and in an auspicious lagna to Sudars\xc2\x92ana, according to the\nprescribed rites.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus ends the 20th Chapter on the Svayamvara hall and the kings\xc2\x92 conversation\nthere in S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 21](bk03ch21.htm)\n\n'
