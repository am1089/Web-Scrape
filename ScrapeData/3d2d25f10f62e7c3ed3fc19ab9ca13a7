So now I am on my way to set the court-room in order. [ _He walks\nabout and looks around him_.] Here is the court-room. I will enter. [ _He\nenters, sweeps, and puts a seat in its place_.] There! I have tidied up the\ncourt-room and put the seats in readiness, and now I will go and tell the\nmagistrates. [ _He walks about and looks around him_.] But see! Here comes\nthat arrant knave, the king\'s brother-in-law. I will go away without\nattracting his attention. [ _He stands apart. Enter Sansth \xc4\x81naka, in gorgeous\nraiment_.]\n\n_Sansth_. I bathed where water runs and flows and purls;\n\nI shat within a garden, park, and grove  \nWith women, and with females, and with girls,  \nWhose lovely limbs with grace angelic move.1\n\nMy hair is shometimes done up tight, you shee;  \nIn locks, or curls, it hangs my forehead o\xc2\x92er;  \nShometimes \xc2\x92tis matted, shometimes hanging free;\n\nAnd then again, I wear a pompadour.  \nI am a wonder, I\'m a wondrous thing,  \nAnd the husband of my shishter is the king.2\n\nAnd beshides, I\'ve found a big hole, like a worm that has crawled into the\nknot of a lotush-root, and is looking for a hole to creep out at. Now who was\nI going to accuse of thish wicked deed? [ _He recalls something_.] Oh, yesh! I\nremember. I was going to accuse poor Ch\xc4\x81rudatta of thish wicked deed.\nBeshides, he\'s poor. They\'ll believe anything about him. Good! I\'ll go to the\ncourt-room and lodge a public complaint against Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, how he shtrangled\n\np. 133\n\nVasantasen\xc4\x81 and murdered her. Sho now I\'m on my way to the court-room. [He\nwalks about and looks around him.] Here is the court-room. I\'ll go in. [He\nenters and looks about.] Well, here are the sheats, all arranged. While I\'m\nwaiting for the magishtrates, I\'ll jusht sit down a minute on the grass. [ _He\ndoes so_.]\n\n_Beadle_. [ _Walks about in another direction, and looks before him_.] Here\ncome the magistrates. I will go to them. [ _He does so_.]\n\n[ _Enter the judge, accompanied by a gild-warden, a clerk, and others_.]\n\n_Judge_. Gild-warden and clerk!\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. We await your bidding.\n\n_Judge_. A trial depends to such an extent upon others that the task of the\nmagistrates\xc2\x97the reading of another\'s thoughts\xc2\x97is most difficult.\n\nMen often speak of deeds that no man saw,  \nMatters beyond the province of the law;  \nPassion so rules the parties that their lies  \nHide their offenses from judicial eyes;  \nThis side and that exaggerate a thing,  \nUntil at last it implicates the king;  \nTo sum it up: false blame is easy won,  \nA true judge little praised, or praised by none.3\n\nAnd again:\n\nMen often point to sins that no man saw,  \nAnd in their anger scorn the patient law;  \nIn court-rooms even the righteous with their lies  \nHide their offenses from judicial eyes;  \nAnd those who did the deed are lost to view,  \nWho sinned with plaintiff and defendant too;  \nTo sum it up: false blame is easy won,  \nA true judge little praised, or praised by none.4\n\nFor the judge must be\n\nLearned, and skilled in tracing fraud\'s sly path,  \nAnd eloquent, insensible to wrath; p. 134  \nTo friend, foe, kinsman showing equal grace,  \nReserving judgment till he know the case;  \nUntouched by avarice, in virtue sound,  \nThe weak he must defend, the knave confound;  \nAn open door to truth, his heart must cling  \nTo others\' interests, yet shun each thing  \nThat might awake the anger of the king.5\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. And do men speak of defects in your virtue? If so,\nthen they speak of darkness in the moonlight.\n\n_Judge_. My good beadle, conduct me to the court-room.\n\n_Beadle_. Follow me, Your Honor. [ _They walk about_.] Here is the court-room.\nMay the magistrates be pleased to enter. [ _All enter_.] Judge. My good\nbeadle, do you go outside and learn who desires to present a case.\n\n_Beadle_. Yes, sir. [ _He goes out_.] Gentlemen, the magistrates ask if there\nis any here who desires to present a case.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Gleefully_.] The magishtrates are here. [ _He struts\nabout_.] I desire to present a cashe, I, an arishtocrat, a man, a V\xc4\x81sudeva,\nthe royal brother-in-law, the brother-in-law of the king.\n\n_Beadle_. [ _In alarm_.] Goodness! The king\'s brother-in-law is the first who\ndesires to present a case. Well! Wait a moment, sir. I will inform the\nmagistrates at once. [ _He approaches the magistrates_.] Gentlemen, here is\nthe king\'s brother-in-law who has come to court, desiring to present a case.\n\n_Judge_. What! the king\'s brother-in-law is the first who desires to present a\ncase? Like an eclipse at sunrise, this betokens the ruin of some great man.\nBeadle, the court will doubtless be very busy to-day. Go forth, my good man,\nand say "Leave us for to-day. Your suit cannot be considered."\n\n_Beadle_. Yes, Your Honor. [ _He goes out, and approaches Sansth \xc4\x81naka_.] Sir,\nthe magistrates send word that you are to leave them for to-day; that your\nsuit cannot be considered.\n\np. 135\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Wrathfully_.] Confound it! Why can\'t my shuit be\nconshidered? If it isn\'t conshidered, then I\'ll tell my brother-in-law, King\nP\xc4\x81laka, my shishter\'s husband, and I\'ll tell my shishter and my mother too,\nand I\'ll have thish judge removed, and another judge appointed. [ _He starts\nto go away_.]\n\n_Beadle_. Oh, sir! Brother-in-law of the king! Wait a moment. I will inform\nthe magistrates at once. [ _He returns to the judge_.] The brother-in-law of\nthe king is angry, and says\xc2\x97[ _He repeats Sansth \xc4\x81naka\'s words_.]\n\n_Judge_. This fool might do anything. My good man, tell him to come hither,\nthat his suit will be considered.\n\n_Beadle_. [ _Approaching Sansth \xc4\x81naka_.] Sir, the magistrates send word that\nyou are to come in, that your suit will be considered. Pray enter, sir.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Firsht they shay it won\'t be conshidered, then they shay it\nwill be conshidered. The magishtrates are sheared. Whatever I shay, I\'ll make\n\xc2\x92em believe it. Good! I\'ll enter. [ _He enters and approaches the\nmagistrates_.] I am feeling very well, thank you. Whether you feel well or\nnot\xc2\x97that depends on me.\n\n_Judge_. [ _Aside_.] Well, well! We seem to have a highly cultivated\nplaintiff. [ _Aloud_.] Pray be seated.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Well! Thish floor belongs to me. I\'ll sit down wherever I\nlike. [ _To the gild-warden_.] I\'ll sit here. [ _To the beadle_.] Why\nshouldn\'t I sit here? [ _He lays his hand on the judge\'s head_.] I\'ll sit\nhere. [ _He sits down on the floor_.]\n\n_Judge_. You desire to present a case?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Of courshe.\n\n_Judge_. Then state the case.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I\'ll whishper it. I was born in the great family of a man as\nglorioush as a wine-glass.\n\nMy father\'s father of the king\xc2\x97in law;  \nThe king, he is my daddy\'s son-in-law; p. 136  \nAnd I am brother to the king\xc2\x97in law;  \nAnd the husband of my shishter is the king.6\n\n_Judge_. All this we know.\n\nWhy should you boast of this your noble birth?  \n\xc2\x92Tis character that makes the man of worth;  \nBut thorns and weeds grow rank in fertile earth.7\n\nState your case.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. I will, but even if I was guilty, he wouldn\'t do anything to\nme. Well, my shishter\'s husband liked me, and gave me the besht garden there\nis, the old garden Pushpakaranda, to play in and look after. And there I go\nevery day to look at it, to keep it dry, to keep it clean, to keep it\nblosshoming, to keep it trimmed. But fate decreed that I shaw\xc2\x97or rather, I\ndidn\'t shee \xc2\x97the proshtrate body of a woman.\n\n_Judge_. Do you know who the unfortunate woman was?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Hello, magishtrates! Why shouldn\'t I know? A woman like that!\nthe pearl of the city! adorned with a hundred golden ornaments! Shombody\'s\nunworthy shon enticed her into the old garden Pushpakaranda when it was empty,\nand for a mere trifle\xc2\x97for her money!\xc2\x97shtrangled Vasantasen\xc4\x81 and killed her.\nBut I didn\'t\xc2\x97[ _He breaks off, and puts his hand over his mouth_.]\n\n_Judge_. What carelessness on the part of the city police! Gild-warden and\nclerk, write down the words "I didn\'t," as the first article in the case.\n\n_Clerk_. Yes, sir. [ _He does so_.] Sir, it is written.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Aside_.] Goodnessh! Now I\'ve ruined myshelf, like a man\nthat shwallows a cake of rice and milk in a hurry. Well, I\'ll get out of it\nthish way. [ _Aloud_.] Well, well, magishtrates! I was jusht remarking that I\ndidn\'t shee it happen. What are you making thish hullabaloo about? [ _He wipes\nout the written words with his foot_.]\n\np. 137\n\n_Judge_. How do you know that she was strangled\xc2\x97and for her money?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Hello! Why shouldn\'t I think sho, when her neck was shwollen\nand bare, and the places where you wear jewels didn\'t have any gold on them?\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. That seems plausible.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Aside_.] Thank heaven! I breathe again. Hooray!\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. Upon whom does the conduct of this case depend?\n\n_Judge_. The case has a twofold aspect.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. How so?\n\n_Judge_. We have to consider the allegations, then the facts. Now the\ninvestigation of the allegations depends upon plaintiff and defendant. But the\ninvestigation of the facts must be carried out by the wisdom of the judge.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. Then the conduct of the case depends upon the\npresence of Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s mother?\n\n_Judge_. Precisely. My good beadle, summon Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s mother, without,\nhowever, giving her cause for anxiety.\n\n_Beadle_. Yes, Your Honor. [ _He goes out, and returns with the mother of the\ncourtezan_.] Follow me, madam.\n\n_Mother_. My daughter went to the house of a friend to enjoy her youth. But\nnow comes this gentleman\xc2\x97long life to him!\xc2\x97and says "Come! The judge summons\nyou." I find myself quite bewildered. My heart is palpitating. Sir, will you\nconduct me to the court-room?\n\n_Beadle_. Follow me, madam. [ _They walk about_.] Here is the courtroom. Pray\nenter, madam. [ _They enter_.]\n\n_Mother_. [ _Approaching_.] Happiness be yours, most worthy gentlemen.\n\n_Judge_. My good woman, you are very welcome. Pray be seated.\n\np. 138\n\n_Mother_. Thank you. [ _She seats herself_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Abusively_.] You\'re here, are you, you old bawd?\n\n_Judge_. Tell me. Are you Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s mother?\n\n_Mother_. I am.\n\n_Judge_. Whither has Vasantasen\xc4\x81 gone at this moment?\n\n_Mother_. To the house of a friend.\n\n_Judge_. What is the name of her friend?\n\n_Mother_. [ _Aside_.] Dear me! Really, this is very embarrassing. [ _Aloud_.]\nAny one else might ask me this, but not a judge.\n\n_Judge_. Pray do not be embarrassed. The conduct of the case puts the\nquestion.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. The conduct of the case puts the question. You incur\nno fault. Speak.\n\n_Mother_. What! the conduct of the case? If that is so, then listen, worthy\ngentlemen. There lives in the merchants\xc2\x92 quarter the grandson of the merchant\nVinayadatta, the son of S\xc4\x81garadatta, a man whose name is a good omen in\nitself\xc2\x97that name is Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. In his house my daughter enjoys her youth.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Did you hear that? Write those words down. My contention is\nwith Ch\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. It is no sin for Ch\xc4\x81rudatta to be her friend.\n\n_Judge_. The conduct of this case demands the presence of Ch\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. Exactly.\n\n_Judge_. Dhanadatta, write as the first article in the case "Vasantasen\xc4\x81 went\nto the house of Ch\xc4\x81rudatta." But must we summon the worthy Ch\xc4\x81rudatta also?\nNo, the conduct of the case summons him. Go, my good beadle, summon\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta,\xc2\x97but gently, without haste, without giving him cause for anxiety,\nrespectfully, as it were incidentally,\xc2\x97with the words "The judge wishes to see\nyou."\n\np. 139\n\n_Beadle_. Yes, Your Honor. [ _He goes out, then returns with Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.]\nFollow me, sir.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Thoughtfully_.]\n\nMy character and kin are known  \n  Unto the king who rules our state;  \nAnd in this summons there is shown  \n  A doubt begotten of my wretched fate.8\n\n[ _Reflectively. Aside_.]\n\nAh! Were there those, the man to recognize  \n  Who met me on the road, from bondage freed?  \nOr did the king, who sees through cunning spies,  \n  Learn that my cart was lent him in his need?  \nWhy should I else be forced to tread the street,  \nLike one accused of crime, my judge to meet?9\n\nBut why consider thus? I must go to the court-room. My good beadle, conduct me\nto the court.\n\n_Beadle_. Follow me, sir. [ _They walk about_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Apprehensively_.] And what means this?\n\nHear how the gloomy raven hoarsely croaks;  \n  The slaves of justice summon me again;  \nMy left eye twitches; these repeated strokes  \n  Of threatened evil frighten me and pain.10\n\n_Beadle_. Follow me, sir, gently and without haste.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Walks about and looks before him_.]\n\nUpon the withered tree, a crow  \n    Turns to the sun;  \nHis left eye falls on me. Ah, woe!  \n    My doubt is done.11\n\n[ _He looks in another direction_.] But see! a snake!\n\nHis eye is fixed upon me; and his back  \nFlashes like antimony\'s lustrous black; p. 140  \nHis long tongue quivers; four white fangs appear;  \nHis belly swells and coils. He slumbered here,  \nThis prince of serpents, till I crossed his path,  \nAnd now he darts upon me in his wrath.12\n\nAnd more than this:\n\nI slip, although the ground has felt no rain;  \nMy left eye, and my left arm throb again;  \nAnother bird is screaming overhead;  \nAll bodes a cruel death, and hope is fled.13\n\nSurely, the gods will grant that all may yet be well.\n\n_Beadle_. Follow me, sir. Here is the court-room. Pray enter.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Enters and looks about_.] How wonderfully splendid is the\ncourt-room. For it seems an ocean,\n\nWhose waters are the king\'s advisers, deep  \nIn thought; as waves and shells it seems to keep  \nThe attorneys; and as sharks and crocodiles  \nIt has its spies that stand in waiting files;  \nIts elephants and horses 1 represent  \nThe cruel ocean-fish on murder bent;  \nAs if with herons of the sea, it shines  \nWith screaming pettifoggers\xc2\x92 numerous lines;  \nWhile in the guise of serpents, scribes are creeping  \n  Upon its statecraft-trodden shore: the court  \nThe likeness of an ocean still is keeping,  \n  To which all harmful-cruel beasts resort.14\n\nCome! [ _As he enters, he strikes his head against the door. Reflectively_.]\nAlas! This also?\n\nMy left eye throbs; a raven cries;  \nA serpent coils athwart my path.  \nMy safety now with heaven lies.15\n\nBut I must enter. [ _He does so_.]\n\np. 141\n\n_Judge_. This is Ch\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\nA countenance like his, with clear-cut nose,  \nWhose great, wide-opened eye frank candor shows,  \nIs not the home of wantonness;  \nWith elephants, with horses, and with kine,  \nThe outer form is inner habit\'s sign;  \nWith men no less.16\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. My greetings to the officers of justice. Officials, I salute\nyou.\n\n_Judge_. [ _Betraying his agitation_.] You are very welcome, sir. My good\nbeadle, give the gentleman a seat.\n\n_Beadle_. [ _Brings a seat_.] Here is a seat. Pray be seated, sir. [ _Ch\n\xc4\x81rudatta seats himself_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Angrily_.] You\'re here, are you, you woman-murderer? Well!\nThish is a fine trial, thish is a jusht trial, where they give a sheat to\nthish woman-murderer. [ _Haughtily_.] But it\'s all right. They can give it to\nhim.\n\n_Judge_. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, have you any attachment, or affection, or friendship,\nwith this lady\'s daughter?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. What lady?\n\n_Judge_. This lady. [ _He indicates Vasantasen \xc4\x81\'s mother_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Rising_.] Madam, I salute you.\n\n_Mother_. Long life to you, my son! [ _Aside_.] So this is Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. My\ndaughter\'s youth is in good hands.\n\n_Judge_. Sir, is the courtezan your friend? [ _Ch \xc4\x81rudatta betrays his\nembarrassment_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. He tries to hide the deed he did;\n\nHe lies, from shame or fear;  \n  He murdered her, of her got rid  \nFor gold, and thinks the deed is hid;  \n  Not sho his mashter here.17\n\np. 142\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. Speak, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. Do not be ashamed. This is a\nlawsuit.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _In embarrassment_.] Officials, how can I testify that a\ncourtezan is my friend? But at worst, it is youth that bears the blame, not\ncharacter.\n\n_Judge_. The case is hard; then banish shame,\n\n  Though it oppress your heart;  \nSpeak truth with fortitude, and aim  \n  To set deceit apart.18\n\nDo not be embarrassed. The conduct of the case puts the question.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Officer, with whom have I a lawsuit?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Arrogantly_.] With me!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. A lawsuit with you is unendurable!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Well, well, woman-murderer! You murder a woman like\nVasantasen\xc4\x81 who used to wear a hundred gems, and now you try deceitful\ndeceivings to hide it!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. You are a fool.\n\n_Judge_. Enough of him, good Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. Speak the truth. Is the courtezan\nyour friend?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. She is.\n\n_Judge_. Sir, where is Vasantasen\xc4\x81?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. She has gone home.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. How did she go? When did she go? Who accompanied her?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Aside_.] Shall I say that she went unobserved?\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. Speak, sir.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. She went home. What more shall I say?\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. She was enticed into my old garden Pushpakaranda, and was\nshtrangled for her money. Now will you shay that she went home?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Man, you are crazy.\n\np. 143\n\nThe very clouds of heaven wet not you;  \n  Your lips are like the blue jay\'s wing-tip worn,  \nYes, full as fickle with their speech untrue,  \n  And like the winter lotus lustre-lorn.19\n\n_Judge_. [ _Aside_.]\n\nTake the Himalayan hills within your hand,  \nAnd swim from ocean strand to ocean strand,  \nAnd hold within your grasp the fleeting wind:  \nThen may you think that Ch\xc4\x81rudatta sinned.20\n\n[ _Aloud_.] This is the noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. How could he commit this crime? [\n_He repeats the verse_ "A countenance like his:" _page_ 141.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Why thish partiality in a lawshuit?\n\n_Judge_. Away, you fool!\n\nIlliterate, you gloss the Sacred Law,  \n  And still your tongue uninjured find?  \nThe midday sun with steadfast eye you saw,  \n  And are not straightway stricken blind?  \nYou thrust your hand into the blazing fire,  \n  And draw it forth, unscathed and sound?  \nDrag Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s virtue in the mire,  \n  Nor sink beneath this yawning ground?21\n\nHow could the noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta commit a crime?\n\nOf all the riches of the mighty sea  \nOnly the swelling waters now are left,  \nBecause, without consideration, he  \nFor others\' good\xc2\x97himself of all has reft.  \nAnd should this high-souled man, this store-house where  \nAll gems of virtue gather and unite,  \nFor lucre\'s sake, so foul a trespass dare  \nThat in it even his foe could not delight?22\n\n_Mother_. You scoundrel! When the golden casket that was left\n\np. 144\n\nwith him as a pledge was stolen by thieves at night, he gave in place of it a\npearl necklace that was the pride of the four seas. And he should now, for a\nmere trifle\xc2\x97for her money!\xc2\x97do this sin? Oh, my child, come back to me, my\ndaughter! [ _She weeps_.]\n\n_Judge_. Noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, did she go on foot, or in a bullock-cart?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. I did not see her when she went. Therefore I do not know\nwhether she went on foot, or in a bullock-cart.\n\n[ _Enter V \xc4\xabraka, in anger_.]\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. My anger was so prodded to the quick\n\nBy that dishonoring, insulting kick,  \nAnd so I brooded, till at last the night  \nUnwilling yielded to the dawning light.23\n\nSo now I will go to the court-room. [ _He enters_.] May happiness be the lot\nof these honorable gentlemen.\n\n_Judge_. Ah, it is V\xc4\xabraka, the captain of the guard. V\xc4\xabraka, what is the\npurpose of your coming?\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Well! I was looking for Aryaka, in all the excitement about his\nescape from prison. I had my suspicions about a covered bullock-cart that was\ncoming, and wanted to look in. "You\'ve made one inspection, man, I must make\nanother," said I, and then I was kicked by the highly respectable Chandanaka.\nYou have heard the matter, gentlemen. The rest is your affair.\n\n_Judge_. My good man, do you know to whom the bullock-cart belonged?\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. To this gentleman here, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. And the driver said that\nVasantasen\xc4\x81 was in it, and was on her way to have a good time in the old\ngarden Pushpakaranda.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Lishten to that, too!\n\n_Judge_. This moon, alas, though spotless-bright,\n\nIs now eclipsed, and robbed of light; p. 145  \nThe bank is fallen; the waves appear  \nBefouled, that once were bright and clear.24\n\nV\xc4\xabraka, we will investigate your case here later. Mount the horse that stands\nbefore the court-room door, go to the garden Pushpakaranda, and see whether a\nwoman has perished there or not.\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. Yes, sir. [He goes out, then returns.] I have been there. And I saw\nthe body of a woman, torn by wild beasts.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. How do you know that it was the body of a woman?\n\n_V \xc4\xabraka_. That I perceived from the traces of hair and arms and hands and\nfeet.\n\n_Judge_. Alas for the difficulties which are caused by the actions of men!\n\nThe more one may apply his skill,  \nThe harder is the matter still;  \nPlain are indeed the law\'s demands,  \nYet judgment insecurely stands  \nAs some poor cow on shifting sands.25\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Aside_.]\n\nAs bees, when flowers begin to blow,  \nGather to sip the honey, so  \nWhen man is marked by adverse fate,  \nMisfortunes enter every gate.26\n\n_Judge_. Noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, speak truth!\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. A mean and jealous creature, passion-blind,\n\nSets all his soul, some fatal means to find  \nTo slay the man he envies; shall his lies  \nBy evil nature prompted, win the prize?  \nNo! he is unregarded by the wise.27\n\nAnd more than this:\n\nThe creeper\'s beauty would I never blight,  \nNor pluck its flowers; should I not be afraid p. 146  \nTo seize her hair so lovely-long, and bright  \n  As wings of bees, and slay a weeping maid?28\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Hello, magishtrates! How can you inveshtigate the cashe with\nsuch partiality? Why, even now you let thish shcoundrel Ch\xc4\x81rudatta shtay on\nhis sheat.\n\n_Judge_. My good beadle, so be it. [The beadle follows Sansth\xc4\x81naka\'s\nsuggestion.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Consider, magistrates, consider what you are doing! [ _He\nleaves his seat, and sits on the floor_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Dancing about gleefully. Aside_.] Fine! The shin that I did\nfalls on another man\'s head. Sho I\'ll sit where Ch\xc4\x81rudatta was. [ _He does\nso_.] Look at me, Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, and confessh that you murdered her.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Magistrates!\n\nA mean and jealous creature, passion-blind,  \nSets all his soul, some fatal means to find  \nTo slay the man he envies; shall his lies,  \nBy evil nature prompted, win the prize?  \nNo! he is unregarded by the wise.(27)\n\n[ _Sighing. Aside_.]\n\nMy friend Maitreya! Oh, this cruel blow!  \n  My wife, thou issue of a spotless strain!  \nMy Rohasena! Here am I, laid low  \nBy sternest fate; and thou, thou dost not know  \n  That all thy childish games are played in vain.  \n  Thou playest, heedless of another\'s pain!29\n\nBut Maitreya I sent to Vasantasen\xc4\x81, that he might bring me tidings of her, and\nmight restore the jewels which she gave my child, to buy him a toy cart. Why\nthen does he linger?\n\n\n\n[ _Enter Maitreya with the gems_.]\n\n_Maitreya_. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta bade me go to Vasantasen\xc4\x81, to return her\n\np. 147\n\njewels, and he said to me: "Maitreya, Vasantasen\xc4\x81 adorned my dear Rohasena\nwith her own jewels, and sent him thus to his mother. It was fitting that she\nshould give him the jewels, but not that we should receive them. Therefore\nrestore them to her." So now I will go to Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s house. [ _He walks\nabout and looks around, then speaks to a person behind the scenes_.] Ah, it is\nMaster Rebhila. Oh, Master Rebhila, why do you seem so exceedingly troubled? [\n_He listens_.] What! do you mean to say that my dear friend Ch\xc4\x81rudatta has\nbeen summoned to court? That can hardly be an insignificant matter. [ _He\nreflects_.] I will go to Vasantasen\xc4\x81\'s house later, but now I will go to the\ncourt-room. [ _He walks about and looks around_.] Here is the court-room. I\nwill go in at once. [ _He enters_.] May happiness be the lot of the\nmagistrates. Where is my friend?\n\n_Judge_. Here.\n\n_Maitreya_. My friend, I wish you happiness.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. It will be mine.\n\n_Maitreya_. And peace.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. That too will be mine.\n\n_Maitreya_. My friend, why do you seem so exceedingly troubled? And why were\nyou summoned?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. My friend,\n\nA scoundrel I, who bear the blame,  \n  Nor seek in heaven to be blest;  \nA maid\xc2\x97or goddess\xc2\x97\xc2\x92tis the same  \n  But he will say the rest.30\n\n_Maitreya_. What? what?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Whispers_.] That is it.\n\n_Maitreya_. Who says that?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Indicating Sansth \xc4\x81naka_.] This poor fellow is the\ninstrument that fate uses to accuse me.\n\np. 148\n\n_Maitreya_. [ _Aside to Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_.] Why don\'t you simply say that she went\nhome?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Though I say it, it is not believed, so unfortunate is my\ncondition.\n\n_Maitreya_. But gentlemen! He adorned the city of Ujjayin\xc4\xab with mansions,\ncloisters, parks, temples, pools, and fountains, and he should be mad enough\nto commit such a crime\xc2\x97and for a mere trifle? [ _Wrathfully_.] You offspring\nof a loose wench, you brother-in-law of the king, Sansth\xc4\x81naka, you libertine,\nyou slanderer, you buffoon, you gilded monkey, say it before me! This friend\nof mine doesn\'t even draw a flowering jasmine creeper to himself, to gather\nthe blossoms, for fear that a twig might perhaps be injured. How should he\ncommit a crime like this, which heaven and earth call accursed? Just wait, you\nson of a bawd! Wait till I split your head into a hundred pieces with this\nstaff of mine, as crooked as your heart.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Angrily_.] Lishten to that, gentlemen! I have a quarrel, or\na lawshuit, with Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. What right has a man with a pate that looks like\na caret, to shplit my head into a hundred pieces? Not much! You confounded\nrashcal! [ _Maitreya raises his staff repeats his words. Sansth \xc4\x81naka rises\nangrily and strikes him. Maitreya strikes back. During the scuffle the jewels\nfall from Maitreya\'s girdle_.]\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Picks up the jewels and examines them. Excitedly_.] Look,\ngentlemen, look! These are the poor girl\'s jewels! [ _Pointing to Ch\n\xc4\x81rudatta_.] For a trifle like thish he murdered her, and killed her too. [\n_The magistrates all bow their heads_.]\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Aside to Maitreya_.]\n\n\xc2\x92Tis thus my fate would vent its gall,  \nThat at this moment they should fall,  \n  These gems\xc2\x97and with them, I.31\n\n_Maitreya_. But why don\'t you simply tell the truth?\n\np. 149\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. My friend,\n\nThe king perceives with blinded eye,  \n  Nor on the truth that eye will bend;  \nThough telling all, I cannot fly  \n  A wretched and inglorious end.32\n\n_Judge_. Alas! Alas!\n\nWith Mars strives Jupiter, and dies;  \nBeside them both there seems to rise  \nA comet-planet 1 in the skies.33\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. [ _Looking at the casket. To Vasantasen \xc4\x81\'s mother_.]\nMadam, pray examine this golden casket attentively, to see whether it be the\nsame or not.\n\n_Mother_. [ _Examining the casket_.] It is similar, but not the same.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Oh, you old bawd! You confessh it with your eyes, and deny it\nwith your lips.\n\n_Mother_. Away, you scoundrel!\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. Speak carefully. Is it the same or not?\n\n_Mother_. Sir, the craftsman\'s skill captivates the eye. But it is not the\nsame.\n\n_Judge_. My good woman, do you know these jewels?\n\n_Mother_. No, I said. No! I don\'t recognize them; but perhaps they were made\nby the same craftsman.\n\n_Judge_. Gild-warden, see!\n\nGems often seem alike in many ways,  \nWhen the artist\'s mind on form and beauty plays;  \nFor craftsmen imitate what they have seen,  \nAnd skilful hands remake what once has been.34\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. Do these jewels belong to Ch\xc4\x81rudatta?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Never!\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. To whom then?\n\np. 150\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. To this lady\'s daughter.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. How did she lose them?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. She lost them. Yes, so much is true.\n\n_Gild-warden and Clerk_. Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, speak the truth in this matter. For you\nmust remember,\n\nTruth brings well-being in its train;  \nThrough speaking truth, no evils rise;  \nTruth, precious syllable!\xc2\x97Refrain  \nFrom hiding truth in lies.35\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. The jewels, the jewels! I do not know. But I do know that they\nwere taken from my house.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Firsht you take her into the garden and murder her. And now\nyou hide it by tricky trickinessh.\n\n_Judge_. Noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, speak the truth!\n\nMerciless lashes wait to smite  \n  This moment on thy tender flesh;  \nAnd we\xc2\x97we can but think it right.36\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Of sinless sires I boast my birth,\n\n  And sin in me was never found;  \nYet if suspicion taints my worth,  \n  What boots it though my heart be sound?37\n\n[ _Aside_.] And yet I know not what to do with life, so I be robbed of\nVasantasen\xc4\x81. [ _Aloud_.] Ah, why waste words?\n\nA scoundrel I, who bear the blame,  \n  Nor think of earth, nor heaven blest;  \nThat sweetest maid, in passion\'s flame  \n  But he will say the rest.38\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Killed her! Come, you shay it too. "I killed her."\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. You have said it.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. Lishten, my mashters, lishten! He murdered her! No one but\nhim! Doubt is over. Let punishment be inflicted on the body of thish poor\nCh\xc4\x81rudatta.\n\np. 151\n\n_Judge_. Beadle, we must do as the king\'s brother-in-law says.\n\n_Guardsmen_ , lay hold on this Ch\xc4\x81rudatta. [ _The guardsmen do so_.]\n\n_Mother_. Be merciful, good gentlemen, be merciful! [ _She repeats what she\nhad said before, beginning_ "When the golden casket:" _page_ 143.] If my\ndaughter is killed, she is killed. Let him live for me\xc2\x97bless him! And besides,\na lawsuit is a matter between plaintiff and defendant. I am the real\nplaintiff. So let him go free!\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. You shlave, get out of the way! What have you got to shay\nabout him?\n\n_Judge_. Go, madam. Guardsmen, conduct her forth.\n\n_Mother_. Oh, my child, my son!\n\n[ _Exit weeping_.\n\n_Sansth \xc4\x81naka_. [ _Aside_.] I\'ve done shomething worthy of myshelf. Now I\'ll\ngo.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Judge_. Noble Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, the decision lies with us, but the rest depends on\nthe king. And yet, beadle, let King P\xc4\x81laka be reminded of this:\n\nThe Brahman who has sinned, our laws declare,  \n  May not be slain, but banished from the realm,  \nAnd with his wealth entire abroad may fare.39\n\n_Beadle_. Yes, Your Honor. [ _He goes out, then reenters in tears_.] Oh, sirs,\nI was with the king. And King P\xc4\x81laka says: "Inasmuch as he killed Vasantasen\xc4\x81\nfor such a trifle, these same jewels shall be hung about his neck, the drum\nshall be beaten, he shall be conducted to the southern burying-ground, and\nthere impaled." And whoever else shall commit such a crime, shall be punished\nwith the like dreadful doom.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. Oh, how wanton is this act of King P\xc4\x81laka! Nevertheless,\n\nAlthough his counsellors may plunge a king  \n  Into injustice\xc2\x92 dangers great,  \nYet he will reap the woe and suffering;  \n  And \xc2\x92tis a righteous fate.40\n\nAnd more than this:\n\np. 152\n\nThey who pervert the king\'s true bent,  \n  The white crow\'s part who play,  \nHave slain their thousands innocent,  \n  And slay, and slay, and slay.41\n\nMy friend Maitreya, go, greet the mother of my son in my name for the last\ntime. And keep my son Rohasena free from harm.\n\n_Maitreya_. When the root is cut away, how can the tree be saved?\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. No, not so.\n\nWhen man departs to worlds above,  \n  In living son yet liveth he;  \nBestow on Rohasena love  \n  No less than that thou gayest me.42\n\n_Maitreya_. Oh, my friend! I will prove myself your friend by continuing the\nlife that you leave unfinished.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. And let me see Rohasena for a single moment.\n\n_Maitreya_. I will. It is but fitting.\n\n_Judge_. My good beadle, remove this man. [ _The beadle does so_.] Who is\nthere? Let the headsmen receive their orders. [ _The guardsmen loose their\nhold on Ch \xc4\x81rudatta, and all of them go out_.]\n\n_Beadle_. Come with me, sir.\n\n_Ch \xc4\x81rudatta_. [ _Mournfully repeats the verse, page_ 146, _beginning_ "My\nfriend Maitreya!" _Then, as if speaking to one not present_.]\n\nIf you had proved my conduct by the fire,  \n  By water, poison, scales, and thus had known  \n  That I deserved that saws should bite my bone,  \nMy Brahman\'s frame, more could I not desire.  \n  You trust a foeman, slay me thus? \xc2\x92Tis well.  \n  With sons, and sons\xc2\x92 sons, now you plunge to hell!43\n\nI come! I come!\n\n[ _Exeunt omnes_.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[140:1](lcc15.htm#fr_82) Elephants were employed as executioners; and,\naccording to Lall\xc4\x81d\xc4\xabkshita, the horses served the same purpose.\n\n[149:1](lcc15.htm#fr_83) This refers to the fallen jewels.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act the Tenth: The End](lcc16.htm)\n\n'
