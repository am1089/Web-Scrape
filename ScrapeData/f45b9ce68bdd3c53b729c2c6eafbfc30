For Pra _g_\napati, having freed all beings from evil,\n\np. 72\n\nfrom death, he now desired, 'May I produce creatures, may I procreate!'\n\n8:4:3:22\\. He spake unto the vital airs 1, 'Together with you, I will here\nbring forth creatures!'--'Wherewith shall we sing praises 2?'--'With me and\nwith\n\np. 73\n\nyourselves!'--'So be it!' So they sang praises both with the vital airs and\nwith Pra _g_ apati; and whatsoever the gods do, that they do with praise, that\n--praise being sacrifice--they do with sacrifice. Hence (the words) 'they sang\npraises' recur with all (these bricks).\n\n8:4:3:33\\. [They lay them down, with, Va _g_. S.

These, then, are seventeen bricks he lays down,--the year, Pra\n_g_ apati, is seventeenfold, he is the progenitor: it is thus by this\nseventeenfold year, by Pra _g_ apati, the progenitor, that he caused these\ncreatures to be generated. And what he generated, he created; and inasmuch as\nhe created (s _ri_ _g_ ), therefore they are called creations (s _ri_ sh _t_\ni). Having created them, he made them enter his own self: and in like manner\ndoes the Sacrificer now cause these creatures to be generated by that\nseventeenfold year, by Pra _g_ apati, the progenitor; and having created them,\nhe makes them enter his own self 1. On the\n\np. 77\n\nrange of the Reta _h_ si _k_ (he lays down these bricks): the Reta _h_ si _k_\nbeing the ribs, and the ribs the middle (of the body), it is in the very\nmiddle that he causes these creatures to enter him. He lays them on all sides:\nfrom all sides he thus makes these creatures to enter him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[71:1](sbe4317.htm#fr_143) The seventeen S _ri_ sh _t_ is are to be placed\nround the centre, along the reta _h_ si _k_ range, in such a way that nine\nbricks lie south\n\n![THE CENTRAL PART OF THE FOURTH LAYER.](img/07100.jpg)  \nTHE CENTRAL PART OF THE FOURTH LAYER.\n\n(Seventeen s _ri_ sh _t_ i and two _ri_ tavya.)\n\nand eight bricks north, of the spine; and that five bricks form the southern\nside, and four bricks each of the three other sides. Whilst the bricks of the\nsouth side are further specified as consisting of a brick, a foot square,\nlying on the cross-spine, being flanked on both sides by half-foot bricks, and\nthese again by square bricks; no particulars are given regarding the other\nsides. Most likely, however, as indicated in the accompanying sketch, four\nsquare bricks, two on each side of the cross-spine, are to form the left\n(north) side, whilst the front and hind sides are to consist of two p. 72\nsquare bricks lying north and south of the spine, and flanked by half-foot\nbricks.\n\n[72:1](sbe4317.htm#fr_144) That is, to the deities representing the vital\nairs, viz. the regions, &c. Mahidh.\n\n[72:2](sbe4317.htm#fr_145) Professor Delbruck, in his Altindische Syntax, pp.\n136, 257, 265, takes 'stoshyamahe' in this passage in a passive sense--'by\nwhom shall we be praised?' I think, however, that this is a mistake, and\nHarisvamin's commentary certainly takes it in the same sense as I have done;\nand, indeed, the paragraphs which follow seem to me to make it quite clear\nthat no other interpretation is possible. Pra _g_ apati is about to perform\nthe 's _ri_ sh _t_ is,' i. e. the creation of living beings by means of\nsacrifice (his own self). He requires the assistance of the Pra _n_ as (vital\nairs) in order to produce creatures endowed with breath, and he also appeals\nto (the three most prominent of) them in their capacity as _Ri_ shis (VI, 1,\n1, 1 seq.) to officiate as his (Udgat _ri_ ) priests. They ask, 'Wherewith\nshall we sing praises?' and he answers, 'With me and with your own selves.'\nThe wherewith,' according to Harisvamin, refers both to the 'stotriya' verses\nto be used, and to the deities of the s _ri_ sh _t_ i-stotras. That the\nformer, at all events, is indeed the case, a glance at the subsequent\nparagraphs shows, where the stotriyas are identified with the vital airs, and,\nwhen their number (ten) becomes exhausted, with parts of the year (Pra _g_\napati), and of his (the Sacrificer's, or Pra _g_ apati's) body. As regards the\ndeities whom Harisvamin considers to be likewise implied, this also is by no\nmeans improbable, though I must confess that it did not occur to me, before I\nlooked at the commentary. In the Udgat _ri_ 's text-books, the chanting of\nstotras is usually interpreted as symbolising the production of 'food' (cf.,\nfor instance, Ta _n_ _d_ ya-Br. I, 3, 6, 'anna _m_ karishyamy anna _m_\npravishyamy anna _m_ _g_ anayishyami'), whilst here it seems identified with\nthe production of life, or breath itself (cf. ib. 5, 'b _ri_ haspatis tva\nyunaktu devebhya _h_ pra _n_ aya &c.'); and, accordingly, in Sat. Br. X, 3, 1,\n1, 7, the principal vital air, the breath proper, is called 'pra _g_ anana-pra\n_n_ a.'\n\n[76:1](sbe4317.htm#fr_146) That is, he makes them pass into his own power,\nmakes them his own.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 4, 4.
