Vyasa said :-- O King! The two powerful Danavas Vaskala and Durmukha,\nwell-versed in arts of warfare, went out for battle, maddened with their\nprowess. The two Danavas, elated with vanity, went to the battle-field and\nbegan to address the Devi in voice deep as the rumbling of a cloud. O\nBeautiful Devi! You better choose and worship the Lord of the Daityas, that\nhigh-souled Mahi _s_ asura who has conquered all the Devas. He will come\nbefore you in privacy in a human shape, with all auspicious signs and adorned\nwith beautiful ornaments. O Sweet smiling One! better place your highest\nfeelings of love on the lovely Mahi _s_ a as your husband, and you will get\nall the pleasures of the three worlds as you desire. O Sweet speaking! In\nshort, if you select him as your husband, you will be the mistress of those\nincomparable worldly happinesses that women always aspire.\n\n\n\n7-13. Hearing thus the words of Vaskala and Durmukha, the Devi said :-- \xc2\x93O\nStupid! Do you think Me as deluded by passion? Do I not possess strength and\nintelligence that I will worship that hypocrite Mahi _s_ a\n\n\n\np. 398\n\n** **\n\nas husband? See! The ladies of a high family select those persons that are\nequal in rank as far as family and distinctions, qualifications and propriety\nof conduct are concerned or those who are superior in beauty, cleverness,\nintelligence and other qualifications. Then how can a Devi, becoming\npassionate, worship the worst of all beasts, the beast Mahi _s_ a? O two\nAsuras! Go you immediately to your King Mahi _s_ a resembling in his body like\nan elephant and having a pair of horns and tell him, Go either to Patala (the\nnether regions) or come and fight with Me; the Lord of the Devas will no doubt\nbe happy if the war ensues.  O Stupid! My advent here cannot go in vain; I\nwill easily slay you and then depart; knowing this do as you like. O Beast!\nWithout conquering Me, you would get no shelter either in the heavens, or in\nthis earth, or in the caves of mountains?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n14-25. Vyasa said :-- Hearing thus, the two powerful Daityas, with eyes\nreddened with anger, firmly resolved to fight and took bows and arrows in\ntheir hands. O Descent of Kuru! The Devi then made a terrible noise and\nfearlessly stood there. The two Danavas then began to shoot dreadful arrows at\nHer. For the victory of the Devas, the Devi also begin to hurl arrows after\narrows on the two Danavas, emitting a sweet sound. Vaskala first came forward\nwith no delay; and Durmukha stood aloof there simply as a witness. The\nterrible fight then ensued between the Devi and Vaskala; arrows, swords and\nweapons were seen shining in the air and raised terror to those that were dull\nin intellect. Then the Mother of the Universe seeing Vaskala growing turbulent\nshot at him five arrows sharpened on stone. The Danava, too, cut off the\narrows of the Devi and hurled seven arrows at Her, seated on a lion. The Devi\ncut off the Danava\xc2\x92s arrows and shot at that hypocrite, sharpened arrows and\nbegan to laugh frequently. She again cut off his arrows with Ardhachandra\narrow; Vaskala then pursued the Devi with a club in his hands to slay Her.\nSeeing the arrogant Danava with club in his hands, Cha _nd_ ika Devi struck\nhim down on the ground with Her own club. The very powerful Vaskala fell down\non the ground but rose up within a very short time and hurled again on the\nDevi his club. Seeing him again attacking Her, the Devi got angry and pierced\nhim with Her trident; Vaskala fell down, thus pierced, and died.\n\n\n\n26-38. Vaskala falling thus dead on the field, the soldiers of the wicked\ndemon routed; whereas the Devas became glad and repeatedly shouted aloud,\n\xc2\x93Victory to the Devi.\xc2\x94 On this Daitya being slain, Durmukha came forward on\nthe battle-field, filled with anger and accompanied by a stronger army.\nMounted on a chariot, shielded all over his\n\n\n\np. 399\n\n\n\nbody with a coat of armour, Durmukha came before the Devi, shouting all along,\n\xc2\x93Wait, wait, O You weak woman!\xc2\x94 and with bows and arrows in his hands. The\nDevi blew Her conchshell and made sounds by stretching Her bow in order to\nmake the Danava infuriated with anger. The Asura then began to shoot sharp\narrows after arrows like poisonous snakes. The Mahamaya, by Her own arrows,\ncut off those of Her enemy and began to shout loudly. The fight then raged\nfuriously, when both parties began to use arrows, S\xc2\x92aktis, clubs, Mu _s_ alas,\nand Tomaras. Blood began to flow in the battle-field in torrents like rivers\nand on the banks of that river of blood, were seen the severed heads of the\ndead bodies which looked like so many hollow shells of gourds, as if kept\nthere by the attendant of the god of Death, for their swimming purposes. The\nbattle-field, then, became very dreadful and impassable; at some places dead\nbodies are lying; wolves are feeding on their flesh; at other places are seen\njackals, dogs, herons, crows, vultures, eagles, and other voracious birds and\nbeasts and iron-tipped arrows, eating the dead bodies of those wicked demons.\nAir began to emit an offensive smell, because of its contact with these\ncorpses; and there were heard the heart-rending sounds of various carnivorous\nbirds and animals. Then the wicked Durmukha began, as if inspired by the god\nof Death, to address the Devi angrily and arrogantly with his right hand\nraised up before Her. \xc2\x93Your brain has become perverted; fly away just now or I\nwill send you unto death, or you better accept the proud Mahi _s_ a, the lord\nof the Daityas, as your husband.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n39-50. The Devi said :-- \xc2\x93O Villain! I see your death at hand this very day;\ntherefore you are deluded and therefore raving like a mad man. I will kill you\ntoday like Vaskala. O Stupid! Better fly away; or if you prefer death, then\nwait; I will slay you first; then the dull Mahi _s_ a, the son of a she-\nbuffalo.\xc2\x94 Hearing thus, Durmukha, as if prompted by Death, hurled dreadful\narrows on the Devi. Instantly the Devi, too, cut off all his arrows and,\ninfuriated with anger, pierced the Danava by sharpened arrows as Indra had\npierced Vritrasura before. The fight then turned out very dreadful. O King!\nWeak persons become very afraid and strong ones become very excited. Instantly\nthe Devi cut off the Asura\xc2\x92s bow and broke his chariot by five arrows. On\nseeing his chariot broken, the powerful Durmukha attacked on foot the Devi\nwith his club, very hard to overcome. He knocked at the head of the lion with\nthat club with great force; but the powerful lion did not become unsteady,\nthough so very hard hit. Seeing the demon thus standing before Her, the\ngoddess Ambika cut down his head by her sharpened axe. On his head being thus\nsevered, Durmukha fell down dead on the field. The band of Immortals, then,\nloudly shouted, \xc2\x93Victory to the Devi.\xc2\x94 When Durmukha was slain, the\n\n\n\np. 400\n\n\n\nImmortals from the celestial space began to chant praises and hymns to the\nDevi, showered down flowers on Her head and gave shouts of \xc2\x93Victory to the\nDevi.\xc2\x94 The Ri _s_ is, Siddhas, Gandarbhas, Vidyadharas, and Kinnaras all\nbecame very glad to see the Demon dead on the field.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirteenth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the killing of Vaskala\nand Durmukha in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Mahapura _n_ am, of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 14](bk05ch14.htm)\n\n'
