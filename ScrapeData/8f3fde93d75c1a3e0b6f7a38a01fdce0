For that very reason that (ether) is Brahman.\n\nBecause the clause 'What is Ka the same is Kha' speaks of ether as\ncharacterised by pleasure, the ether which is denoted by 'Kha' is no other\nthan the highest Brahman. To explain. On the Fires declaring 'Breath is\nBrahman, Ka is Brahman, Kha is Brahman,' Upako _s_ ala says, 'I understand\nthat breath is Brahman, but I do not understand Ka and Kha.' The meaning of\nthis is as follows. The Fires cannot speak of meditation on Brahman under the\nform of breath and so on, because they are engaged in giving instruction to\nme, who am afraid of birth, old age, death, &c., and desirous of final\nRelease. What they declare to me therefore is meditation on Brahman itself.\nNow here Brahman is exhibited in co-ordination with certain well-known things,\nbreath and so on. That Brahman should be qualified by co-ordination with\nbreath is suitable, either from the point of view of Brahman having the\nattribute of supporting the world, or on account of Brahman being the ruler of\nbreath, which stands to it in the relation of a body. Hence Upako _s_ ala\nsays, 'I understand that\n\np. 277\n\nbreath is Brahman.' With regard to pleasure and ether, on the other hand,\nthere arises the question whether they are exhibited in the relation of\nqualifying attributes of Brahman on the ground of their forming the body of\nBrahman, and hence being ruled by it, or whether the two terms are meant to\ndetermine each other, and thus to convey a notion of the true nature of\nBrahman being constituted by supreme delight. On the former alternative the\ndeclaration of the Fires would only state that Brahman is the ruler of the\nelemental ether and of all delight depending on the sense-organs, and this\nwould give no notion of Brahman's true nature; on the latter alternative the\nFires would declare that unlimited delight constitutes Brahman's true nature.\nIn order to ascertain which of the two meanings has to be taken, Upakosala\ntherefore says, 'I do not understand Ka and Kha.' The Fires, comprehending\nwhat is in his mind, thereupon reply, 'What is Ka the same is Kha, what is Kha\nthe same is Ka,' which means that the bliss which constitutes Brahman's nature\nis unlimited. The same Brahman therefore which has breath for its attribute\nbecause breath constitutes its body, is of the nature of unlimited bliss; the\ntext therefore adds, 'They taught him that (viz. Brahman) as breath and as\nether.' What the text, 'Ka is Brahman, Kha is Brahman,' teaches thus is\nBrahman as consisting of unlimited bliss, and this Brahman is resumed in the\nsubsequent text about the Person seen within the eye. That Person therefore is\nthe highest Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 17. And on account of the statement of the way of him who has heard the\nUpanishads](sbe48083.htm)\n\n"
