XI.\n\nOf the Sadacharas, or perpetual obligations of a householder. Daily\npurifications, ablutions, libations, and oblations: hospitality: obsequial\nrites: ceremonies to be observed at meals, at morning and evening worship, and\non going to rest.\n\nSAGARA again said to Aurva, "Relate to me, Muni, the fixed observances of the\nhouseholder, by attending to which he will never be rejected from this world\nor the next."\n\nAurva replied to him thus: "Listen, prince, to an account of those perpetual\nobservances, by adhering to which both worlds are subdued. Those who are\ncalled Sadhus (saints) are they who are free from all defects; and the term\nSat means the same, or Sadhu: those practices or observances (\xc3\x81charas) which\nthey follow are therefore called Sadacharas, the institutions or observances\nof the pious 1.\' The seven Rishis, the Manus, the patriarchs, are they who\nhave enjoined and who have practised these observances. Let the wise man awake\nin the Muhurtta of Brahma. (or in the third Muhurtta, about two hours before\nsunrise), and with a composed mind meditate on two of the objects of life\n(virtue and wealth), and on topics not incompatible with them. Let him also\nthink upon desire, as not conflicting with the other two; and thus contemplate\nwith equal indifference the three ends of life, for the purpose of counter-\nacting the unseen consequences of good or evil acts. Let him avoid wealth and\ndesire, if they give uneasiness to virtue; and abstain from virtuous or\nreligious acts, if they involve misery, or are censured by the world 2. Having\nrisen, he must offer adoration to the sun; and then, in\n\np. 301\n\nthe south-east quarter, at the distance of a bowshot or more, or any where\nremote from the village, void the impurities of nature. The water that remains\nafter washing his feet he must throw away into the courtyard of the house. A\nwise man will never void urine on his own shadow, nor on the shadow of a tree,\nnor on a cow, nor against the sun, nor on fire, nor against the wind, nor on\nhis Guru, nor men of the three first castes; nor will he pass either excrement\nin a ploughed field, or pasturage, or in the company of men, or on a high\nroad, or in rivers and the like, which are holy, or on the bank of a stream,\nor in a place where bodies are burnt; or any where quickly. By day let him\nvoid them with his face to the north, and by night with his face to the south,\nwhen he is not in trouble. Let him perform these actions in silence, and\nwithout delay; covering his head with a cloth, and the ground with grass. Let\nhim not take, for the purposes of cleanliness, earth from an ant-hill, nor a\nrat-hole, nor from water, nor from the residue of what has been so used, nor\nsoil that has been employed to plaster a cottage, nor such as has been thrown\nup by insects, or turned over by the plough. All such kinds of earth let him\navoid, as means of purification. One handful is sufficient after voiding\nurine; three after passing ordure: then ten handfulls are to be rubbed over\nthe left hand, and seven over both hands. Let him then rince his mouth with\nwater that is pure, neither fetid, nor frothy, nor full of bubbles; and again\nuse earth to cleanse his feet, washing them well with water. He is to drink\nwater then three times, and twice wash his face with it; and next touch with\nit his head, the cavities of the eyes, ears, and nostrils, the forehead, the\nnavel, and the heart 3. Having finally washed his mouth, a man is to clean and\ndress his hair, and to decorate his person, before a glass, with unguents,\ngarlands, and perfumes. He is then, according to the custom of his caste, to\nacquire wealth, for the sake of subsistence; and with a lively faith worship\nthe gods. Sacrifices with the acid juice, those with clarified butter, and\nthose with offerings of food, are comprehended in\n\np. 302\n\nwealth: wherefore let men exert themselves to acquire wealth for these\npurposes 4.\n\n"As preparatory to all established rites of devotion the householder should\nbathe in the water of a river, a pond, a natural channel, or a mountain\ntorrent; or he may bathe upon dry ground, with water drawn from a well, or\ntaken from a, river, or other source, where there is any objection to bathing\non the spot 5. When bathed, and clad in clean clothes, let him devoutly offer\nlibations to the gods, sages, and progenitors, with the parts of the hand\nseverally sacred to each. He must scatter water thrice, to gratify the gods;\nas many times, to please the Rishis; and once, to propitiate Prajapati: he\nmust also make three libations, to satisfy the progenitors. He must then\npresent, with the part of the hand sacred to the manes, water to his paternal\ngrandfather and great-grandfather, to his maternal grandfather, great-\ngrandfather, and his father; and at pleasure to his own mother and his\nmother\'s mother and grandmother, to the wife of his preceptor, to his\npreceptor, his maternal uncle, and other relations 6, to a dear friend, and to\nthe\n\np. 303\n\nking. Let him also, after libations have been made to the gods and the rest,\npresent others at pleasure for the benefit of all beings, reciting inaudibly\nthis prayer; \'May the gods, demons, Yakshas, serpents, Rakshasas, Gandharbas,\nPisachas, Guhyakas, Siddhas, Kushman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as, trees, birds, fish, all that people\nthe waters, or the earth, or the air, be propitiated by the water I have\npresented to them. This water is given by me for the alleviation of the pains\nof all those who are suffering in the realms of hell. May all those who are my\nkindred, and not my kindred, and who were my relations in a former life, all\nwho desire libations from me, receive satisfaction from this water. May this\nwater and sesamum, presented by me, relieve the hunger and thirst of all who\nare suffering from those inflictions, wheresoever they may be 7.\'\nPresentations of water, given in the manner, oh king, which I have described,\nyield gratification to all the world: and the sinless man, who in the\nsincerity of faith pours out these voluntary libations, obtains the merit that\nresults from affording nutriment to all creatures.\n\n"Having then rinced his mouth, he is to offer water to the sun, touching his\nforehead with his hands joined, and with this prayer; \'Salutation to Vivaswat,\nthe radiant, the glory of Vishn\xcc\x81u; to the pure illuminator of the world; to\nSavitri, the granter of the fruit of acts.\' He is then to perform the worship\nof the house, presenting to his tutelary deity water, flowers, and incense. He\nis next to offer oblations with fire, not preceded by any other rite, to\nBrahma 8. Having invoked Prajapati, let him pour oblations reverently to his\nhousehold gods, to Ka\xc5\x9byapa and to Anumati 9, in succession. The residue of the\noblation let him offer to\n\np. 304\n\nthe earth, to water, and to rain, in a pitcher at hand; and to Dhatri and\nVidhatri at the doors of his house, and in the middle of it to Brahma. Let the\nwise man also offer the Bali, consisting of the residue of the oblations, to\nIndra, Yama, Varun\xcc\x81a, and Soma, at the four cardinal points of his dwelling,\nthe east and the rest; and in the north-east quarter he will present it to\nDhanwantari 10. After having thus worshipped the domestic deities, he will\nnext offer part of the residue to all the gods (the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas); then, in the\nnorth-west quarter, to Vayu (wind); then, in all directions, to the points of\nthe horizon, to Brahma, to the atmosphere, and to the sun; to all the gods, to\nall beings, to the lords of beings, to the Pitris, to twilight. Then taking\nother rice 11, let the householder at pleasure cast it upon a clean spot of\nground, as an offering to all beings, repeating with collected mind this\nprayer; \'May gods, men, animals, birds, saints, Yakshas, serpents, demons,\nghosts, goblins, trees, all that desire food given by me; may ants, worms,\nmoths, and other insects, hungered and bound in the bonds of acts; may all\nobtain satisfaction from the food left them by me, and enjoy happiness. May\nthey who have neither mother, nor father, nor relations, nor food, nor the\nmeans of preparing it, be satisfied and pleased with the food presented for\ntheir contentment 12. Inasmuch as all beings, and this food, and I, and\nVishn\xcc\x81u are not different, I therefore give for their sustenance the food that\nis one with the body of all creatures. May all beings, that are comprehended\nin the fourteen orders of existent things 13, be satisfied with the food\nbestowed by me for their gratification, and be delighted.\'\n\np. 305\n\n[paragraph continues] Having uttered this prayer, let the devout believer cast\nthe food upon the ground, for the nourishment of all kinds of beings; for the\nhouseholder is thence the supporter of them all. Let him scatter food upon the\nground for dogs, outcasts, birds, and all fallen and degraded persons.\n\n"The householder is then to remain at eventide in his courtyard as long as it\ntakes to milk a cow 14, or longer if he pleases, to await the arrival of a\nguest. Should such a one arrive, he is to be received with a hospitable\nwelcome; a seat is to be offered to him, and his feet are to be washed, and\nfood is to be given him with liberality, and he is to be civilly and kindly\nspoken to; and when he departs, to be sent away by his host with friendly\nwishes. A householder should ever pay attention to a guest who is not an\ninhabitant of the same village, but who comes from another place, and whose\nname and lineage are unknown. He who feeds himself, and neglects the poor and\nfriendless stranger in want of hospitality, goes to hell. Let a householder\nwho has a knowledge of Brahma reverence a guest, without inquiring his\nstudies, his school, his practices, or his race 15.\n\n"A householder should also at the perpetual \xc5\x9araddha entertain another Brahman,\nwho is of his own country, whose family and observances are known, and who\nperforms the five sacramental rites. He is likewise to present to a Brahman\nlearned in the Vedas four handfulls of food, set apart with the exclamation\nHanta; and he is to give to a mendicant religious student three handfulls of\nrice, or according to his pleasure when he has ample means. These, with the\naddition of the mendicant before described, are to be considered as guests;\nand he who treats these four descriptions of persons with hospitality acquits\nhimself of the debt due to his fellow men. The guest who departs disappointed\nfrom any house, and proceeds elsewhere, transfers his sins to the owner of\nthat mansion, and takes away with him such a householder\'s merits. Brahma,\nPrajapati, Indra, fire, the Vasus, the sun, are present in the person of a\n\np. 306\n\nguest, and partake of the food that is given to him. Let a man therefore be\nassiduous in discharging the duties of hospitality; for he who eats his food\nwithout bestowing any upon a guest feeds only upon iniquity.\n\n"In the next place the householder must provide food for a married damsel,\nremaining in her father\'s dwelling; for any one who is ill; for a pregnant\nwoman; for the aged and the infants of his house; and then he may eat himself.\nHe who eats whilst these are yet unfed is guilty of sin in this life, and when\nhe dies is condemned in hell to feed upon phlegm. So he who eats without\nperforming ablutions is fed in hell with filth; and he who repeats not his\nprayers, with matter and blood: he who eats unconsecrated food, with urine;\nand he who eats before the children and the rest are fed is stuffed in\nTartarus with ordure. Hear therefore, oh king of kings, how a householder\nshould feed, so that in eating no sin may be incurred, that invariable health\nand increased vigour may be secured, and all evils and hostile machinations\nmay be averted. Let the householder, having bathed, and offered libations to\nthe gods and manes, and decorated his hand with jewels, proceed to take his\nmeal, after having repeated the introductory prayers, and offered oblations\nwith fire, and having given food to guests, to Brahmans, to his elders, and to\nhis family. He must not eat with a single garment on, nor with wet hands and\nfeet, but dressed in clean clothes, perfumed, and wearing garlands of flowers:\nhe must not eat with his face to any intermediate point of the horizon, but\nfronting the east or the north: and thus, with a smiling countenance, happy\nand attentive, let him partake of food, of good quality, wholesome, boiled\nwith clean water, procured from no vile person nor by improper means, nor\nimproperly cooked. Having given a portion to his hungry companions, let him\ntake his food without reproach out of a clean handsome vessel, which must not\nbe placed upon a low stool or bed. He must not eat in an unfit place or out of\nseason, nor in an incommodious attitude; nor must he first cast any of his\nmeal into the fire. Let his food be made holy with suitable texts; let it be\ngood of its kind; and it must not be stale, except in the case of fruit or\nmeat 16; nor must it be of\n\np. 307\n\ndry vegetable substances, other than jujubes 17 or preparations of molasses;\nbut never must a man eat of that of which the juices have been extracted 18.\nNor must a man eat so as to leave no residue of his meal, except in the case\nof flour, cakes, honey, water, curds, and butter. Let him, with an attentive\nmind, first taste that which has a sweet flavour: he may take salt and sour\nthings in the middle course, and finish with those which are pungent and\nbitter. The man who commences his meal with fluids, then partakes of solid\nfood, and finishes with fluids again, will ever be strong and healthy. In this\nmanner let him feed without fault, silent, and contented with his food;\ntaking, without uttering a word, to the extent of five handfulls, for the\nnutriment of the vital principle. Having eaten sufficiently, the householder\nis then to rinse his mouth, with his face turned towards the east or the\nnorth; and having again sipped water, he is to wash his hands from the wrist\ndownwards. With a pleased and tranquil spirit he is then to take a seat, and\ncall to memory his tutelary deity; and then he is thus to pray: \'May fire,\nexcited by air, convert this food into the earthly elements of this frame, and\nin the space afforded by the etherial atmosphere cause it to digest, and yield\nme satisfaction! May this food, in its assimilation, contribute to the vigour\nof the earth, water, fire, and air of my body, and afford unmixed\ngratification! May Agasti, Agni, and submarine fire effect the digestion of\nthe food of which I have eaten; may they grant me the happiness which its\nconversion into nutriment engenders; and may health ever animate my form! May\nVishn\xcc\x81u, who is the chief principle of all invested with bodily structure and\nthe organs of sense, be propitiated by my faith in him, and influence the\nassimilation of the invigorating food which I\n\np. 308\n\nhave eaten! For verily Vishn\xcc\x81u is the eater and the food and the nutriment:\nand through this belief may that which I have eaten be digested.\'\n\n"Having repeated this prayer, the householder should rub his stomach with his\nhand, and without indolence perform such rites as confer repose, passing the\nday in such amusements as are authorized by holy writings, and are not\nincompatible with the practices of the righteous; until the Sandhya, when he\nmust engage in pious meditation. At the Sandhya, at the close of the day he\nmust perform the usual rites before the sun has quite set; and in the morning\nhe must perform them before the stars have disappeared 19. The morning and\nevening rites must never be neglected, except at seasons of impurity, anxiety,\nsickness, or alarm. He who is preceded by the sun in rising, or sleeps when\nthe sun is setting, unless it proceed from illness and the like, incurs guilt\nwhich requires atonement; and therefore let a man rise before the sun in the\nmorning, and sleep not until after be has set. They who sinfully omit both the\nmorning and the evening service go after death to the hell of darkness. In the\nevening, then, having again dressed food, let the wife of the householder, in\norder to obtain the fruit of the Vai\xc5\x9bwadeva rite, give food, without prayers,\nto outcasts and unclean spirits. Let the householder himself, according to his\nmeans, again shew hospitality to any guest who may arrive, welcoming him with\nthe salutation of evening, water for his feet, a seat, a supper, and a bed.\nThe sin of want of hospitality to a guest who comes after sunset is eight\ntimes greater than that of turning away one who arrives by day. A man should\ntherefore most especially shew respect to one who comes to him in the evening\nfor shelter, as the attentions that gratify him will give pleasure to all the\ngods. Let the householder, then, according to his ability, afford a guest\nfood, potherbs, water, a bed, a mat, or, if he can do no more, ground on which\nto lie.\n\n"After eating his evening meal, and having washed his feet, the householder is\nto go to rest. His bed is to be entire, and made of wood: it is not to be\nscanty, nor cracked, nor uneven, nor dirty, nor infested by insects,\n\np. 309\n\nnor without a bedding: and he is to sleep with his head either to the east or\nto the south; any other position is unhealthy. In due season a man should\napproach his wife, when a fortunate asterism prevails, in an auspicious\nmoment, and on even nights, if she is not unbathed, sick, unwell, averse,\nangry, pregnant, hungry, or over-fed. He should be also free from similar\nimperfections, should be neatly attired and adorned, and animated by\ntenderness and affection. There are certain days on which unguents, flesh, and\nwomen are unlawful, as the eighth and fourteenth. lunar days, new moon and\nfull moon 20, and the entrance of the sun into a new sign. On these occasions\nthe wise will restrain their appetites, and occupy themselves in the worship\nof the gods, as enjoined by holy writ, in meditation, and in prayer; and he\nwho behaves differently will fall into a hell where ordure will be his food.\nLet not a man stimulate his desires by medicines, nor gratify them with\nunnatural objects, or in public or holy places. Let him not think\nincontinently of another\'s wife, much less address her to that end; for such a\nman will be born in future life as a creeping insect. He who commits adultery\nis punished both here and hereafter; for his days in this world are cut short,\nand when dead he falls into hell. Thus considering, let a man approach his own\nwife in the proper season, or even at other times."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[300:1](vp085.htm#fr_838) Sir Wm. Jones renders \xc3\x81chara, \'the immemorial\ncustoms of good men\' (Manu, II. 6); following the explanation of Kulluka\nBhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a, which is much the same as that of our text. \'\xc3\x81chara means the use of\nblankets or bark, &c. for dress. Sadhus are pious or just men.\' \xc3\x81charas are,\nin fact, all ceremonial and purificatory observances or practices, not\nexpiatory, which are enjoined either by the Vedas or the codes of law.\n\n[300:2](vp085.htm#fr_839) That is, he may omit prescribed rites, if they are\nattended with difficulty or danger: he may forego ablutions, if they disagree\nwith his health; and he may omit pilgrimage to holy shrines, if the way to\nthem is infested by robbers. Again, it is injoined in certain ceremonies to\neat meat, or drink wine; but these practices p. 301 are generally reprehended\nby pious persons, and a man may therefore disregard the injunction.\n\n[301:3](vp085.htm#fr_840) Many of these directions are given by Manu, IV. 45,\n&c.\n\n[302:4](vp085.htm#fr_841) That is, wealth is essential to the performance of\nreligious rites, and it is also the consequence of performing them. A\nhouseholder should therefore diligently celebrate them, that he may acquire\nproperty, and thus be enabled to continue to sacrifice. According to Gautama\nthere are seven kinds of each of the three sorts of sacrificial rites\nparticularized in the text, or those in which the Soma juice, oiled butter, or\nfood are presented. Of the latter, according to Manu, there are four\nvarieties, the offering of food to the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas, to spirits, to deceased\nancestors, and to guests. II. 86. The seven of Gautama are, offerings to\nprogenitors on certain eighth days of the fortnight, at the full and change,\nat \xc5\x9araddhas generally, and to the manes on the full moon of four different\nmonths, or \xc5\x9aravan, Agrahayan\xcc\x81a, Chaitra, and \xc3\x81swin.\n\n[302:5](vp085.htm#fr_842) A person may perform his ablutions in his own house,\nif the weather or occupation prevent his going to the water. If he be sick, he\nmay use warm water; and if bathing be altogether injurious, he may perform the\nMantra snana, or repeat the prayers used at ablution, without the actual bath.\n\n[302:6](vp085.htm#fr_843) The whole series is thus given by Mr. Colebrooke;\nAs. Res. V. 367. Triple libations of tila (sesamum seeds) and water are to be\ngiven to the father, paternal grandfather, and great grandfather; to the\nmother, maternal grandfather, great grandfather, and great great grandfather:\nand single libations are to be offered to the paternal and maternal\ngrandmother and great grandmother, to the paternal uncle, brother, son,\ngrandson, daughter\'s son, son-in-law, maternal uncle, sister\'s son, father\'s\nsister\'s son, mother\'s sister, and p. 303 other relatives. With exception of\nthose, however, offered to his own immediate ancestors, which are obligatory,\nthese libations are optional, and are rarely made.\n\n[303:7](vp085.htm#fr_844) The first part of this prayer is from the Sama-veda,\nand is given by Mr. Colebrooke. As. Res. V. 367.\n\n[303:8](vp085.htm#fr_845) The rite is not addressed to Brahma specially, but\nhe is to be invoked to preside over the oblations offered to the gods and\nsages subsequently particularized.\n\n[303:9](vp085.htm#fr_846) Ka\xc5\x9byapa, the son of Ka\xc5\x9byapa, is \xc3\x81ditya, or the sun.\nAnumati is the personified moon, wanting a digit of full. The objects and\norder of the ceremony here succinctly described differ from those of which Mr.\nColebrooke gives an account (As. Res. VII. 236), and from the form of\noblations given by Ward (Account of the Hindus, II. 447); but, as observed by\nMr. Colebrooke, "oblations are made with such ceremonies, and in such form, as\nare p. 304 adapted to the religious rite which is intended to be subsequently\nperformed." As. Res. VII. 237.\n\n[304:10](vp085.htm#fr_847) See also Manu, III. 84, &c. and the As. Res. VII.\n275.\n\n[304:11](vp085.htm#fr_848) Or this ceremony may be practised instead of the\npreceding.\n\n[304:12](vp085.htm#fr_849) This prayer is said by Mr. Colebrooke to be taken\nfrom the Puran\xcc\x81as (As. Res. VII. 275): he translates the last clause, May they\nwho have neither food, nor means of obtaining it.\' In our text the phrase is\n### which the commentator explains by ### understanding Anna siddhi to mean\n\'means of dressing food,\' Paka sadhana. The following passages of the prayer\nare evidently peculiar to the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\n[304:13](vp085.htm#fr_850) Either fourteen classes of Bhutas or spirits, or\nthe same number of living beings, or eight species of divine, one of human,\nand five of animal creatures.\n\n[305:14](vp085.htm#fr_851) This, according to the commentator, is equal to the\nfourth part of a Ghat\xcc\x81ika, which, considering the latter synonymous with\nMuhurtta, or one-thirtieth of the day and night, would be twelve minutes.\n\n[305:15](vp085.htm#fr_852) These precepts, and those which follow, are of the\nsame tenor as those given by Manu on the subject of hospitality (III. 99,\n&c.), but more detailed.\n\n[306:16](vp085.htm#fr_853) By stale, as applied to meat, is intended in this\nplace probably meat which has been previously dressed as part of an offering\nto the gods or manes: meat which p. 307 is dressed in the first instance for\nan individual being prohibited; as by Yajnawalkya: \'Let him avoid flesh killed\nin vain;\' or that which is not the residue of an offering to the gods, &c. So\nalso Manu, V. 7.\n\n[307:17](vp085.htm#fr_854) By dried vegetables, &c. is to be understood\nunboiled vegetables, or potherbs dressed without being sprinkled with water:\nInstead of \'jujubes,\' the reading is sometimes \'myrobalans:\' the other term,\n###, is explained \'sweet-meats.\' The construction here, however, is somewhat\nobscure.\n\n[307:18](vp085.htm#fr_855) As oil-cake, or the sediment of any thing after\nexpression.\n\n[308:19](vp085.htm#fr_856) So Manu, II. 101. and IV. 93.\n\n[309:20](vp085.htm#fr_857) So Manu, IV. 128.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XII](vp086.htm)\n\n'
