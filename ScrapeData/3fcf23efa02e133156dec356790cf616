'Of all living things there are indeed three origins only 4, that which\nsprings from an egg (oviparous), that which springs from a living being\n(viviparous), and that which springs from a germ.\n\n2\\. 'That Being 5 (i. e. that which had produced fire, water, and earth)\nthought, let me now enter those three beings 5 (fire, water, earth) with this\nliving\n\np. 95\n\n[paragraph continues] Self ( _g_ iva atma) 1, and let me then reveal (develop)\nnames and forms.\n\n3\\. 'Then that Being having said, Let me make each of these three tripartite\n(so that fire, water, and earth should each have itself for its principal\ningredient, besides an admixture of the other two) entered into those three\nbeings (devata) with this living self only, and revealed names and forms.\n\n4\\.

Up. four are mentioned, a _n_ _d_ a\n_g_ a, here a _n_ _d_ a _g_ a, _g_ aru _g_ a (i.e. _g_ arayu _g_ a), here _g_\niva _g_ a, sveda _g_ a, and udbhi _g_ _g_ a, sveda _g_ a, born from heat,\nbeing additional. Cf. Atharva-veda I, 12, 1.\n\n[94:5](sbe01121.htm#fr_279) The text has devata, deity; here used in a very\ngeneral sense. The Sat, though it has produced fire, water, and earth, has not\nyet obtained its wish of becoming many.\n\n[95:1](sbe01121.htm#fr_280) This living self is only a shadow, as it were, of\nthe Highest Self; and as the sun, reflected in the water, does not suffer from\nthe movement of the water, the real Self does not suffer pleasure or pain on\nearth, but the living self only.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 4](sbe01122.htm)\n\n"
