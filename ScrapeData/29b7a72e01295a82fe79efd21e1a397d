Consciousness may be compared to a powerful revolving light\nwhich leaves in darkness, that which it illumined so brightly the instant\nbefore. Therefore, when the light of consciousness reveals this universe, the\nuniverse seems real. Take away the light and the world loses reality. So it is\nthat from conscious knowledge and Atmic wisdom the universe becomes real to\nus.\n\n"To the seekers after name, fame and pleasure, the house of the mind is\nfounded on the delusion of birth and death. But the adherents of truth will be\nfree from these delusions, for birth is but death (or cessation of\nconsciousness) to former life, and death is birth (or renewed consciousness)\ninto another period of life.\n\n"All is Brahma and the \'I\' is Brahma,--relinquish\n\np. 127\n\nthe idea that the universe is something outside the \'I\'. The objects of\ncreation arising from Brahmic wisdom do not really exist, but are as the foamy\nspray cast up by the ocean. One principle alone Brahma is constant, enduring\nand eternally IS. Pleasure nor pain, nor the whirlpool of birth and death do\nnot really exist. Brahma alone exists.\n\n"Experience and inference teach the transient nature of fleeting pleasure and\npain. Why then dwell upon them? Forget the past and the future and rest in the\nneutral state of truth, putting aside the duality of love and hate. Look\nequally upon all, steadfast in the certainty of Atmic wisdom, secure in the\nstronghold of mind withheld from [worldly](errata.htm#13) objects.\n\n"So may you, O lotus-eyed Ram, be the crystal, which mirrors pain but does not\nsuffer it.\n\n"Thus Atmic wisdom will flush the dawn of the final birth. For where shall one\nseek the lustrous bamboo pearl, but in the bamboo clusters? For in these\nblessed ones, nobility, love, benevolence and clarity of intellect find\nresidence, and these qualities of Atmic wisdom draw to them the people of the\nworld like the melodious\n\np. 128\n\nflute brings rapture even to the hearts of kine. "Two paths lead to\nliberation. On one, the faithful following of the precepts laid down by a Guru\nshall let delusion fall away, to be replaced with emancipation. Peace shall\ncome either in the immediate birth or in a succeeding birth. The other path is\nopen to one whose mind is already bulwarked by knowledge, and who will, by\nmeditation, cultivate the fertile seed into the full blossom of wisdom.\n\n"Of the second path this story is related: An emperor, fearless, generous and\nof untold wealth once reigned over this universe. Into his domain never a\ntaint of jealousy or envy entered. This King, Janak by name, and Videha by\nreputation, whose noble heart embraced the world, was a true protector of his\npeople.\n\n"In the first days of vernal spring King Janak walked in his charming garden\namong his [fragrant](errata.htm#14) flowers. Without its gates the guards were\nstationed. Strolling about, the King heard the murmuring voices of the Sidhas\n(they who have attained the One-ness) from the hills. Hear attentively, O Ram,\nthe songs of the Sidhas--they who have withdrawn from the pleasures of the\n\np. 129\n\nvisible.\n\n"Chanted a Sidha\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n"\'In the union of the Knower and the Known lies the bliss or wisdom. Seek this\nwisdom, so that the unreal many become the real.\'\n\n"Another sang\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n"\'Desire will destroy the visible. Contemplate Atmic reality--the beacon to\nthe eagle vision of higher spirituality.\'\n\n"From the chorus of voices\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n"\'Having become all-pervading, like he who sits between truth and untruth,\nmeditate always upon Atmic wisdom, the Light of Lights.\n\n"\'To seek without for God, is like one who goes in quest of bright bits of\nglass, unmindful of the jewel blazing his own hand.\n\n"\'Atma is attained only by those who have controlled their desires. Those who\nrecklessly entangle themselves in the quick sands of human experience, knowing\nbetter, can only be called asses.\n\n"\'The hissing serpents of the desirous organs must be slain by the mind; just\nas the great god Indra levelled the mountains to dust by his thunderbolt.\n\np. 130\n\n"The mind, free from delusion which calmly surveys all as one, will attain\nAtmic Reality--the plenum of complete bliss. This is liberation.\n\n"The sage counsels of the Sidhas, awoke consternation in the mind of King\nJanak. He left behind his cool scented garden, entered his palace and\ndismissed his attendants.\n\n"Seeking a quiet apartment on the top floor of his palace, he gave himself to\nmeditation upon the wise utterances of the Sidhas. In contemplation he hoped\nto discover the true meaning of these blissful counsellors. He thought how the\npeople of the world were like birds forever on the wing, fluttering hither and\nthither from this bush to that flower, only to drop at last with weariness,\nand perish. The good King cried out in his anguish of mind.\n\n"\'Annoyances beset me. Worries, doubts and circumstances enmesh me in this\nuncertain world. I spin about like a leaf in a whirlpool. When I reflect that\ntime in its true nature is eternal. I cannot but deem the one hundred years of\nmy life, as a moment in eternity. Why, then,\n\np. 131\n\ndo I value my life so greatly and allow my strong desires to throw me into\nconfusion and dejection? What greater debasement than a mind despoiled of\ntranquility? That I should consider for a moment this unsettled existence.\nThis world of pain I rule is but an atom among the countless universes. Search\nas I will, I can find nothing which remains constant and beneficent, even for\na fleeting moment. Behold the incongruities of this world. The greatest shall\nbe dust, even as the lowliest. Wealth! Have I fancied riches real? Name and\nfame! The great men of ancient times and their valorous deeds have vanished.\nWhere, then, is the certainty that the achievements of my time shall persist?\n\n"\'The myriad worlds with their rulers and wealth have perished, like sand\nwashed into the sea. Where, O my distraught mind, have these universes gone?\nSo shall this, my world, go the way of eternity. My desires and my illusions\nhave led me to believe in a permanency, which does not exist. My many deaths\nhave taught me nothing. When shall the blessed time come when I shall seek and\nfind **THAT** , which has no end? About me the objects of the world wear\n\np. 132\n\nthe shrouds of destruction. Every instant of every day, the ignorant walk the\npaths of perdition their bodies enacting the baneful deeds of pleasure and\npain. In youth they are unwise; maturity finds them entangled in the meshes of\npassion and the burden of the world bows them down in old age.\n\n"\'Harassed from birth to death, doing the deeds of desire, how can they find\ntime to pursue virtue and seek the eternal truth? Illusion dances in this\nworld like a will-o-wisp, and my mind dances in unison with illusion--both\nspecters of the Real in this unreal theatre.\n\n"\'Untruth is an excrescence upon the Crown of Truth, and pain thrusts its\ntalons into the side of Virtue. Since pain is the accompaniment of pure and\nimpure pleasure alike, how may we discern the difference between them? If\nbetween the opening and closing of my eyes many Brahmas are created and\ndestroyed, what is my puny self before them? Great wealth breeds pain in the\nmind of its owner, but a thing fraught with peril, becomes a source of\n\'happiness, for a mind which controls it rightly. It is only the worldly life\nwhich is the source of pain. Can happiness\n\np. 133\n\nenter a life submerged in worldliness? The tree of the ignorant mind sprouts\nfrom the root of delusion and its branches bear poison fruits.\n\n"\'Mind is the thinking principle. By the discipline of thought, the mind\nitself can easily be controlled. The extinction of delusion controls birth and\ndeath. Oh, I know at last the thief who has robbed me of the Atmic jewel of my\nSelf. His name is Mind. Long and grievously I have suffered, I shall impale\nhim with his own bright sword of thought.\n\n"\'Until now I have not been able to pierce the pearl of mind. Now I will\nstring this pearl upon the strand of experience, and with it adorn my person.\nI have listened well to the wise counsels of the omniscient Sidhas. At last I\nrest in the bliss in which the great Brahma floats. The unrealities of me and\nthee have dropped away, and I will never permit them to return.\n\nVictory is mine over the mighty adversary of mind, who despoiled me of Atmic\nwisdom, and pain has ceased its affliction. I have attained the life of\nsustained peace. Great wisdom has rolled\n\np. 134\n\nback the ponderous door to freedom; my adoration is thine.\'\n\n"Thus did King Janak rest motionless in Samadhi, having controlled the\nfluctuation and vacillation of his mind. After a long period of Samadhic bliss\nhe looked anew upon his world, his vision cleared of the fog of desire. He\nreflected that he had no objective for which to strive in this world. His\nclear sight scrutinized the world for illusion and found pure wisdom.\n\n"\'I know nothing,\' he rejoiced, \'but my immaculate divine wisdom, the\nrealization of my Self. I shall neither seek nor turn from any object in this\nworld. I shall remain constant in my divine Self. Events will transpire as\npre-ordained.\' So saying, the King was enveloped in Brahmic bliss.\n\n"As the warm sun in the sky, without volition or desire, causes the growth of\nseeds in the ground, so King Janak performed the duties, which arise daily\nwithout exultation or longing. Giving heed neither to the past nor the future,\nproductive as such cogitation is of discontent,. King Janak met the present\nserenely, with an undivided heart and mind.\n\np. 135\n\n"The Atmic enquiry engendered by the words of the Sidhas, brought quiescence\nof mind, O Ram, to the ruler of the world, King Janak; for the wisdom of Atma\ncan be attained only by the pure and beautiful Atmic enquiry, and not by\nfollowing the ways of the worldly. For worldlings long for other goals than\nAtma, and realization comes only to those who have sought it faithfully.\nTherefore, O Ram, destroy ignorance, which slinks like a hungry wolf on the\ndesert, that is the world.\n\n"To the wise, the precious jewel of wisdom enthroned in their minds, will\nbring in a moment whatsoever they wish, like the Kalpa tree which produced any\nfruit one desired. Love and hate cannot dent the armour of those who dwell in\nAtmic bliss. The dense mist of egoism screening the Sun of Brahma obscures the\nintelligence, and will be cleared only by the heavenly wind of divine wisdom.\nHe who aspires to the Supreme Brahmic throne must banish desires from his\nmind, for is not the ground well-tilled before the planting of the seed?"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: How Suragho, the King of Hunters, attained realization of\nself](yvhf11.htm)\n\n'
