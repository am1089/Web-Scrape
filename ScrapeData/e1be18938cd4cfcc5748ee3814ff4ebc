It is very difficult to drive joy\nfrom this world, for though it was created for Devas, who were full of joy, it\nis now full of suffering and pain. if Ram\'s indifference toward the world is\ntrue. O Rishis, then we may be justified with what we are doing. If we, the\nSidhas and Rishis, love the things or objects which Ram hated, we should\nperhaps be classed with the ignorant."\n\nRaja Rishi Viswamitra said to Ram: "Thou knowest all that should be known.\nThou and Rishi Suka are full of spiritual wisdom. Both of you have attained\nequally the highest wisdom,\n\np. 35\n\nbut you need to acquire the state of quietness and stillness."\n\nRam: "O, please inform me how Brahm Rishi Suka achieved wisdom without\nquiescence of mind, and how he secured that blissful state?"\n\nThe Master: "Rishi Suka had absolute spiritual wisdom which is the only sword\nto cut the rope of re-birth. Once he tried to inquire of the origin of things,\nas thou art doing, and he then became doubtful of his wisdom. The object of\nhis mind became disturbed, but he was free from sensual desires. Rishi Suka\nwent to the Himalaya Mountains to his father, who was one of the Masters\nthere, and asked for instruction that he might not lose his faith. Thus he\nsaid to his father: \'O Father, from whence came all this Maya (illusion),\nwhich produces misery and darkness? How did it originate? How may it be\ndestroyed?\' What part does it play in the origin of the universe?\' His father\nreplied with wisdom, as he did unto all others, but his answer did not dispel\nhis son\'s doubt. Suka said to his father: \'I know all that\'. And alas! his\nfather was unable to remove his doubt. His father then requested him to go to\nKing Janak, who was the highest being in spiritual wisdom of his time.\n\np. 36\n\n"Rishi Suka left the Himalaya Mountains and later approached the golden gates\nof the King\'s palace. Although the King was aware of Brahm Rishi\'s (Suka)\narrival, he refused to go forth and meet him. He requested that the Rishi\nshould not be admitted into his palace, as he wanted to test the sincerity of\nhis mind. Rishi Suka waited full seven days at the golden gate. At last he was\nconducted into a magnificent hall where beautiful women were indulging in\nworldly enjoyments. But Suka\'s mind did not lose its balance. He was not\naffected by the unjust act of the King in making him wait seven days at his\ngate, nor was he moved by the disgraceful conduct of worldly association. The\nKing came and addressed him thus: \'O, Brahm Rishi (there are three kinds of\nRishis), thou hast reached the highest state. The worldly joys and sorrows do\nnot affect thee. I beseech thee to tell what hast brought thee here?\' Rishi\nSuka asked: \'What has caused my illusion? How does it generate? How can it be\ndestroyed? Please instruct me.\' The King gave him the same explanation that\nhis father had given him. Rishi Suka returned: \'I know that, and my father\ngave me the same\n\np. 37\n\ninformation. If Maya (illusion) which is produced by a differentiation of one\nAtma as breath, etc.) and merged again into the Atma, then no benefit can be\nderived from this perishable Maya (illusion). O Highest Guru, Thou art able to\ndispel this delusion of my mind! Please enlighten me on this matter.\'\n\n"The King: \'Thou hast known what shouldst be known, but still thou asketh me--\nalthough thy father has instructed thee aright. The enlightenment we have\ngiven to thee is the real one. Atma alone, is that which is everywhere, just\nas the ether pervades all space and atmosphere. Wisdom is bound by naught else\nbut its own thought. Freeing thyself from sensual thoughts, is freeing thyself\nfrom bondage. Thou hast clearly realized the Atmic wisdom for thou hast given\nup all longing for sensual objects. Thou hast by thine own efforts, through\nthe higher mind, reached the highest Brahmic State; thou hast become a\nJivanmukta (the state of emancipated embodiment). But one thing thou hast yet\nto accomplish--that of giving up the delusion of the illusion which has arisen\nthrough doubt in thy mind. When thou hast accomplished this, then thou wilt be\nfree.\' King Janak thus initiated Rishi Suka into the Atmic mysteries,\n\np. 38\n\nwhere he acquired the highest state of wisdom, and was freed from all misery,\ndoubt, death and rebirth. He lived for 1000 years, then merged into that\nhigher wisdom, which is Brahm. As water returns to the ocean, so the light\nwhich departs from the "I", returns to the higher light (Atma), and becomes\nBrahm. Thus Rishi attained that liberation, which is above all else. O Ram,\nyou should follow the same path.\n\n"To become a slave of desire is bondage; to master it, is liberation. Master\nyour desires and become indifferent to worldly enjoyments; become a Jivanmukta\n(emancipated embodiment), without the assistance of austerities of religions;\nfollow the path of wisdom and you will realize the reality. O Ram, there is\nbut one person who can remove the doubt from thy mind, and that is the\nOmniscient Vashisht, who knows the past, present, and the future. He is the\nGuru (spiritual teacher) of all mankind."\n\nRishi Viswamitra turned toward Rishi Vashisht and suggested that he should be\ntaught the stories of Brahmic Wisdom, since he is qualified for such\ninstruction. The Brahmic Wisdom should be given only to those who have\ncomplete control of themselves and [withheld](errata.htm#1)\n\np. 39\n\nfrom those who doubt and are full of vice. Thus Viswamitra ends the story of\nSuka.\n\nThe Munis and Rishis, who were present in the assembly hall, praised Rishi\nViswamitra\'s noble instruction.\n\nRishi Vashisht said: "O Muni, well Learned One in all Knowledge, I shall do\naccording to thy request. I shall relate the stories of pure wisdom, which\nhave been given out by Brahma, that mankind may be liberated from the chain of\nrebirth."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Way to Blessed Liberation](yvhf06.htm)\n\n'
