The king Suratha spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Best of the twice born! Who is that Devi\nthat you spoke just now? Why the Devi deludes all these beings? What for does\nShe do so? Whence is the Devi born? What is Her Form? and what are Her\nqualities? O Brahmi _n_! Kindly describe all these to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n3-9. The Muni spoke :-- O King! I will now describe the nature of the Devi\nBhagavati and why does She take Her Form in due time. Listen. In ancient days,\nwhen Bhagavan Naraya _n_ a, the king of the Yogis, was lying in deep sleep on\nthe ocean on the bed of Ananta, after He had destroyed the Universe, there\ncame out of the wax of his ear the two Danavas, Madhu and Kai _t_ abha, of\nmonstrous appearances. They wanted to kill Brahma, who was lying on the lotus\ncoming out of the navel of Bhagavan. Seeing the two Daityas Madhu and Kai _t_\nabha and seeing also Hari asleep the Lotus-born Brahma became very anxious and\nthought :-- Now Bhagavan is asleep; and these two indomitable Daityas are\nready\n\n\n\np. 1039\n\n\n\nto kill me. Now what am I to do? Where to go? How shall I get ease? O Child!\nThus thinking, the high souled Lotus born suddenly came to a practical\nconclusion. He said :-- \xc2\x93Let me now take refuge to the Goddess Sleep, Nidra,\nthe Mother of all and under Whose power Bhagavan Hari is now asleep.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n10-24. Brahma then began to praise Her thus :-- \xc2\x93O Devi of the Devas! O\nUpholdress of the world! Thou grantest desires of Thy devotees. O Thou\nauspicious! Thou art Para Brahma! By Thy Command all are doing respectively\ntheir works in their proper spheres! Thou art the Night of Destruction (Kala\nRatri); Thou art the Great Night (Maha Ratri). Thou art the greatly terrible\nNight of Delusion (Moha Ratri); Thou art omnipresent; omniscient; of the\nnature of the Supreme Bliss. Thou art regarded as the Great. Thou art highly\nworshipped; Thou art alone in this world as highly intoxicated; Thou art\nsubmissive to Bhakti only; Thou art the Best of all the things; Thou art sung\nas the Highest; Thou art modesty; Thou art Pu _st_ i (nourishment); Thou art\nforgiveness (K _s_ ama); Thou art Beauty (Kanti); Thou art the embodiment of\nmercy; Thou art liked by all; Thou art adorned by the whole world; Thou art of\nthe nature of wakefulness, dream and deep sleep; Thou art the Highest; Thou\nart alone Highest Deity; Thou art highly attached to the Supreme Bliss. There\nis no other thing than Thee. There is One only and that is Thee. Hence Thou\nart denominated as One; Thou becomest again the two by contact with Thy Maya.\nThou art the refuge of Dharma, Artha and Kama; hence Thou Thou art Three; Thou\nart the Turiya (the fourth state of consciousness) hence Thou art Four. Thou\nart the God of the five elements; hence Thou art Panchami (five); Thou\npresidest over the six passions Kama, anger, etc.; hence Thou art _S_ a _st_\nhi; Thou presidest over the seven days of the week and Thou grantest boons\nseven by seven; hence Thou art Seven. Thou art the God of the eight Vasus;\nhence Thou art A _st_ ami; Thou art full of the nine Ragas and nine parts and\nThou art the Goddess of nine planets; hence Thou art Navami. Thou pervadest\nthe ten quarters and Thou art worshipped by the ten quarters; hence Thou art\nnamed Das'ami (the tenth day of the fortnight); Thou art served by the Eleven\nRudras, the Goddesses of eleven Ga _n_ as and Thou art fond of Ekadas'i Tithi;\nhence Thou art denominated Ekadas'i; Thou art twelve armed and the Mother of\nthe twelve \xc3\x82dityas; hence Thou art Dvadas'i; Thou art dear to the thirteen Ga\n_n_ as; Thou art the presiding Deity of Visve Devas and Thou art the thirteen\nmonths including the Malas Masa (dirty month), hence Thou art Trayodas'i. Thou\ndidst\n\n\n\np. 1040\n\n\n\ngrant boons to the fourteen Indras and Thou gavest birth to the fourteen\nManus; hence Thou art Chaturdas'i. Thou art knowable by the Pa\xc3\xb1chadas'i. Thou\nart sixteen armed and on Thy forehead the sixteen digits of the Moon are\nalways shining; Thou art the sixteenth digit (ray) of the Moon named Ama;\nhence Thou art _S_ o _d_ as'i. O Deves'i! Thou, though attributeless and\nformless, appearest in these forms and attributes. Thou hast now enveloped in\nMoha and Darkness the Lord of Rama, the Bhagavan, the Deva of the Devas. These\nDaityas, Madhu and Kai _t_ abha are indomitable and very powerful. So to kill\nthem, Thou better dost awake the Lord of the Devas.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n25-34. The Muni said :-- Thus praised by the Lotus-born, the Tamasi Bhagavati\n(the Goddess of sleep and ignorance), the Beloved of Bhagavan, left Vi _sn_ u\nand enchanted the two Daityas.\n\n\n\nOn being awakened, the Supreme Spirit Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of the world, the\nBhagavan, the Deva of the Devas, saw the two Daityas. Those two monstrous\nDanavas, beholding Madhu Sudana, came up before Him, ready to fight. The hand-\nto-hand fight lasted amongst them for five thousand years. Then the two\nDanavas, maddened by their great strength, were enchanted by the Maya of\nBhagavati and told the Supreme Deity, \xc2\x93Ask boon from us.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, the\nBhagavan \xc3\x82di Puru _s_ a, (the Prime Man) asked the boon that both of them\nwould be killed that day by Him. Those two very powerful Danavas spoke to Hari\nagain, \xc2\x93Very well. Kill us on that part of the earth which is not under\nwater.\xc2\x94 O King! Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, the Holder of the conch and club, spoke\n:-- \xc2\x93All right. Indeed! Let that be so.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nSaying this He placed their heads on His thigh and severed them with His disc\n(chakra). O King! Thus Maha Kali, the Queen of all the Yogas arose on this\noccasion when the praise was offered Her by Brahma. O King! Now I will\ndescribe another account how this Maha Lak _s_ mi appeared on another\noccasion. Listen.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eleventh Chapter of the Tenth Book on the killing of Madhu Kai\n_t_ abha in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 12](bk10ch12.htm)\n\n"
