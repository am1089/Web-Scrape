For the same reason breath (is Brahman).\n\nConcerning the udgitha it is said ( _Kh_. Up. I, 10, 9), 'Prastot _ri_ , that\ndeity which belongs to the prastava, &c.,' and, further on (I,11,4; 5), 'Which\nthen is that deity? He said: Breath. For all these beings merge into breath\nalone, and from breath they arise. This is the deity belonging to the\nprastava.' With reference to this passage doubt and decision are to be\nconsidered as analogous to those stated under the preceding Sutra. For while\nin some passages--as, for instance, 'For indeed, my son, mind is fastened to\npra _n_ a,' _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 2; and, 'the pra _n_ a of pra _n_ a,' B _ri_. Up.\nIV, 4, 18--the word 'breath' is seen to denote Brahman, its use\n\np. 85\n\nin the sense of a certain modification of air is better established in common\nas well as in Vedic language. Hence there arises a doubt whether in the\npassage under discussion the word pra _n_ a denotes Brahman or (ordinary)\nbreath. In favour of which meaning have we then to decide?\n\nHere the purvapakshin maintains that the word must be held to denote the\nfivefold vital breath, which is a peculiar modification of wind (or air);\nbecause, as has been remarked already, that sense of the word pra _n_ a is the\nbetter established one.--But no, an objector will say, just as in the case of\nthe preceding Sutra, so here also Brahman is meant, on account of\ncharacteristic marks being mentioned; for here also a complementary passage\ngives us to understand that all beings spring from and merge into pra _n_ a; a\nprocess which can take place in connexion with the highest Lord only.--This\nobjection, the purvapakshin replies, is futile, since we see that the beings\nenter into and proceed from the principal vital air also. For Scripture makes\nthe following statement (Sat. Br. X, 3, 3, 6), 'When man sleeps, then into\nbreath indeed speech merges, into breath the eye, into breath the ear, into\nbreath the mind; when he awakes then they spring again from breath alone.'\nWhat the Veda here states is, moreover, a matter of observation, for during\nsleep, while the process of breathing goes on uninterruptedly, the activity of\nthe sense organs is interrupted and again becomes manifest at the time of\nawaking only. And as the sense organs are the essence of all material beings,\nthe complementary passage which speaks of the merging and emerging of the\nbeings can be reconciled with the principal vital air also. Moreover,\nsubsequently to pra _n_ a being mentioned as the divinity of the prastava the\nsun and food are designated as the divinities of the udgitha and the\npratihara. Now as they are not Brahman, the pra _n_ a also, by parity of\nreasoning, cannot be Brahman.\n\nTo this argumentation the author of the Sutras replies: For the same reason\npra _n_ a--that means: on account of the presence of characteristic marks--\nwhich constituted the reason stated in the preceding Sutra--the word pra _n_ a\nalso\n\np. 86\n\nmust be held to denote Brahman. For Scripture says of pra _n_ a also, that it\nis connected with marks characteristic of Brahman. The sentence, 'All these\nbeings merge into breath alone, and from breath they arise,' which declares\nthat the origination and retractation of all beings depend on pra _n_ a,\nclearly shows pra _n_ a to be Brahman. In reply to the assertion that the\norigination and retractation of all beings can be reconciled equally well with\nthe assumption of pra _n_ a denoting the chief vital air, because origination\nand retractation take place in the state of waking and of sleep also, we\nremark that in those two states only the senses are merged into, and emerge\nfrom, the chief vital air, while, according to the scriptural passage, 'For\nall these beings, &c.,' all beings whatever into which a living Self has\nentered, together with their senses and bodies, merge and emerge by turns. And\neven if the word 'beings' were taken (not in the sense of animated beings,\nbut) in the sense of material elements in general, there would be nothing in\nthe way of interpreting the passage as referring to Brahman.--But. it may be\nsaid, that the senses together with their objects do, during sleep, enter into\npra _n_ a, and again issue from it at the time of waking, we distinctly learn\nfrom another scriptural passage, viz. Kau. Up. III, 3, 'When a man being thus\nasleep sees no dream whatever, he becomes one with that pra _n_ a alone. Then\nspeech goes to him with all names,' &c.--True, we reply, but there also the\nword pra _n_ a denotes (not the vital air) but Brahman, as we conclude from\ncharacteristic marks of Brahman being mentioned. The objection, again, that\nthe word pra _n_ a cannot denote Brahman because it occurs in proximity to the\nwords 'food' and 'sun' (which do not refer to Brahman), is altogether\nbaseless; for proximity is of no avail against the force of the complementary\npassage which intimates that pra _n_ a is Brahman. That argument, finally,\nwhich rests on the fact that the word pra _n_ a commonly denotes the vital air\nwith its five modifications, is to be refuted in the same way as the parallel\nargument which the purvapakshin brought forward with reference to the word\n'ether.' From all this it follows that the pra _n_ a, which is the deity of\nthe prastava, is Brahman.\n\np. 87\n\nSome (commentators) 1 quote under the present Sutra the following passages,\n'the pra _n_ a of pra _n_ a' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 18), and 'for to pra _n_ a\nmind is fastened' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 2). But that is wrong since these two\npassages offer no opportunity for any discussion, the former on account of the\nseparation of the words, the latter on account of the general topic. When we\nmeet with a phrase such as 'the father of the father' we understand at once\nthat the genitive denotes a father different from the father denoted by the\nnominative. Analogously we infer from the separation of words contained in the\nphrase, 'the breath of breath,' that the 'breath of breath' is different from\nthe ordinary breath (denoted by the genitive 'of breath'). For one and the\nsame thing cannot, by means of a genitive, be predicated of--and thus\ndistinguished from--itself. Concerning the second passage we remark that, if\nthe matter constituting the general topic of some chapter is referred to in\nthat chapter under a different name, we yet conclude, from the general topic,\nthat that special matter is meant. For instance, when we meet in the section\nwhich treats of the _g_ yotish _t_ oma sacrifice with the passage, 'in every\nspring he is to offer the _g_ yotis sacrifice,' we at once understand that the\nword denotes the _g_ yotish _t_ oma. If we therefore meet with the clause 'to\npra _n_ a mind is fastened' in a section of which the highest Brahman is the\ntopic, we do not for a moment suppose that the word pra _n_ a should there\ndenote the ordinary breath which is a mere modification of air. The two\npassages thus do not offer any matter for discussion, and hence do not furnish\nappropriate instances for the Sutra. We have shown, on the other hand, that\nthe passage about the pra _n_ a, which is the deity of the prastava, allows\nroom for doubt, purvapaksha and final decision.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[87:1](sbe34029.htm#fr_125) The v _ri_ ttikara, the commentators say.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 24](sbe34030.htm)\n\n"
