Being inflamed, Agni, bring hither to-day the gods to the man who holds\nforth the (sacrificial) ladle. Spin out the ancient thread (of sacrifice)\n[1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:1:1) for the sacrificer who has prepared Soma.\n\n2\\. Measure out, O Tanunapat [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:2:1), the sacrifice\nrich in ghee, rich in honey, of a priest like me, of a sacrificer who has\ntoiled hard.\n\n3\\. The brilliant, purifying, wonderful Nara _s_ a _m_ sa\n[1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:3:1) mixes the sacrifice with honey three times a\nday, the god worthy of worship among the gods.\n\n4\\. Agni, magnified [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:4:1) by us, bring hither the\nbright, beloved Indra. For this my prayer is addressed\n[2](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:4:2) to thee whose tongue is good.\n\n5\\. (Priests) hold forth the (sacrificial) ladle, strewing the sacrificial\ngrass at the decorous service of the sacrifice;--I\n[1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:5:1) trim [2](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:5:2) (the\nsacrificial grass) which best receives the gods with its wide extent, a big\nshelter for Indra.\n\n6 [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:6:1). May the divine doors open themselves, the\nincreasers of _Ri_ ta, the never sticking, large ones, the purifying, much-\ndesired (doors), that the gods may come forth.\n\n7\\. May Night and Dawn, of glorious appearance, the two neighbouring\n(goddesses), wearing beautiful ornaments [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:7:1), the\nyoung [2](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:7:2) mothers of _Ri_ ta, sit down together on\nthe sacrificial grass [3](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:7:3).\n\n8\\. May the two divine Hot _ri_ s, eager in praising (the gods), the sages\nwith lovely tongues, perform\n\np. 154\n\nfor us to-day this successful sacrifice which attains to Heaven.\n\n9\\. The brilliant (goddess) placed among the gods, among the Maruts\n[1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:9:1), Hotra Bharati [2](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:9:2),\nI _l_ a, Sarasvati, and Mahi [3](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:9:3): may these\nworshipful (goddesses) sit down on the sacrificial grass.\n\n10\\. May Tvash _t_ _ri_ , inclined towards us, pour forth for us, in our navel\n[1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:10:1), that wonderful seed with many treasures\n[2](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:10:2), plentiful by itself, for the sake of\nprosperity and wealth [3](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:10:3).\n\n11\\. Letting go (the sacrificial food to the gods) sacrifice by thyself to the\ngods, O tree [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:11:1). May\n[2](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:11:2) Agni make the offerings ready\n[3](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:11:3), the god among the gods, the wise one.\n\n12\\. For Him who is accompanied by Pushan and by the Maruts, by the Vi _s_ ve\ndeva _h_ , (by) Vayu [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:12:1), who is moved by the\nGayatra song, for Indra pronounce the Svaha over the offering.\n\n13\\. Come hither to the offerings over which the Svaha has been pronounced, in\norder to feast. Indra! Come hither! Hear our call! Thee they call at the\nworship.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe hymn is an \xc3\x82prisukta. The same _Ri_ shi. Metre, Anush _t_ ubh. The whole\nhymn is closely related to I, 13.--Verse 10: cf. VS. XXVII, 20; TS. IV, 1, 8,\n3; MS. II, 12, 6.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The third Pada of this verse is identical with VIII, 13, 14.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. I, 13, 2, note 1.\n\np. 155\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Comp. I, 13, 2, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. 'Magnified' is i _li_ ta _h_ ; comp. the note on I, 1, 1. The verse is\naddressed to the I _d_ a _h_.\n\nNote 2. The text has a _k_ _kh_ a \xe2\x80\xa6 va _k_ yate. To me there seems to be no\ndoubt that this is the passive of va _k_ , not of va _\xc3\xb1_ _k_. Comp. the name\nof the priest a _k_ _kh_ avaka, and the phrase a _k_ _kh_ oktibhi _h_\nmatina\xc2\xb4m, I, 61, 3; 184, 2. The same passive of va _k_ is found III, 39, 1.\nmati _h_ hrida _h_ a\xc2\xb4 va _k_ yamana (then follows a _k_ _kh_ a \xe2\x80\xa6 _g_ igati);\nX, 47, 7 (stoma _h_ ) \xe2\x80\xa6 manasa va _k_ yamana _h_.--It may be observed that in\nour passage as well as in III, 39, 1 and X, 47, 7, the forms va _k_ yate, va\n_k_ yamana, va _k_ yamana _h_ are preceded by a vowel; and we may infer that\nthe poet did not say u _k_ yate, &c., in order to avoid the hiatus.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The poet begins as if he intended to say, 'Priests \xe2\x80\xa6 lay down the\nsacrificial grass.' But he continues, I lay down.' Dr. Neisser (Bezzenberger's\nBeitrage, XX, 60) tries to explain the difficulty in a way in which I cannot\nfollow him.\n\nNote 2. On the verb v _ri_ _g_ technically connected with barhi _h_ , see\nGeldner, Vedische Studien, I, 152 seq., and compare vol. xxxii, I, 38, 1, note\n2; I, 64, 1, note 2.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. With the whole verse compare I, 13, 6.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Pischel's opinion (Vedische Studien, II, 113 seq.) that pe _s_ a _h_\nmeans 'Gestalt,' 'Form,' 'Farbe,' 'rupa,' does not convince me.\n\nNote 2. See Geldner, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVIII, 195.\n\np. 156\n\nNote 3. Comp. VIII, 87, 4. a\xc2\xb4 barhi _h_ sidatam sumat. Geldner (Vedische\nStudien, II, 190) translates: 'das schone Opfergras.'\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. 'Should we read marteshu for marutsu?' M. M. This conjecture seems\nperhaps rather bold.\n\nNote 2. Hotra Bharati, i. e. the personified Offering of the Bharatas, seems\nto be one goddess, more usually called simply Bharati. Comp. I, 22, 10; II, 1,\n11; III, 62, 3; Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, I, 322; H. O., Religion des Veda,\n243, note 2. Pischel's opinion (Vedische Studien, II, 85) is different.\n\nNote 3. See above, I, 13, 9, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. On the navel as the symbol of the connection between father and son,\nsee Bergaigne, I, 35, 36, and comp. the well-known name Nabhanedish _th_ a.\n\nNote 2. For puru va\xc2\xb4ram very probably puruva\xc2\xb4ram should be read (Grassmann).\nSee II, 40, 4. puruva\xc2\xb4ram \xe2\x80\xa6 rayas posham vi syatam na\xc2\xb4bhim asme.\n\nNote 3. With the last Pada compare II, 40, 4, quoted in note 2, and II, 3, 9.\npra _g_ a\xc2\xb4m Tvash _t_ a vi syatu na\xc2\xb4bhim asme; see also Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita\nIV, I, 8, 3. Tvash _t_ _ri_ is generally considered as giving sons; see H. O.,\nReligion des Veda, 234.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Comp. I, 13, 11, note 1.\n\nNote 2. The second hemistich recurs I, 105, 14.\n\nNote 3. See Neisser, Zur Vedischen Verballehre, 22.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. The text has 'for Vayu,' not 'for (the god) accompanied by Vayu.' But\nthere is no doubt that pusha _n_ vate, &c., refers to Indra, and that Vayu is\nnamed merely as a companion of Indra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 143](sbe46041.htm)\n\n"
