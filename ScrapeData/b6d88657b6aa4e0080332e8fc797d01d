If it is said that (from the circumstance of Brahman and the individual\nsoul being one) there follows fruition (on the part of Brahman); we say, no;\non account of the difference of nature (of the two).\n\np. 115\n\nBut, it may be said, as Brahman is omnipresent like ether, and therefore\nconnected with the hearts of all living beings, and as it is of the nature of\nintelligence and therefore not different from the individual soul, it follows\nthat Brahman also has the same fruition of pleasure, pain, and so on (as the\nindividual soul). The same result follows from its unity. For in reality there\nexists no transmigratory Self different from the highest Self; as appears from\nthe text, 'There is no other knower but he' (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 23), and\nsimilar passages. Hence the highest Self is subject to the fruition connected\nwith transmigratory existence.\n\nThis is not so, we reply; because there is a difference of nature. From the\ncircumstance that Brahman is connected with the hearts of all living beings it\ndoes not follow that it is, like the embodied Self, subject to fruition. For,\nbetween the embodied Self and the highest Self, there is the difference that\nthe former acts and enjoys, acquires merit and demerit, and is affected by\npleasure, pain, and so on; while the latter is of the opposite nature, i.e.\ncharacterised by being free from all evil and the like. On account of this\ndifference of the two, the fruition of the one does not extend to the other.\nTo assume merely on the ground of the mutual proximity of the two, without\nconsidering their essentially different powers, that a connexion with effects\nexists (in Brahman's case also), would be no better than to suppose that space\nis on fire (when something in space is on fire). The same objection and\nrefutation apply to the case of those also who teach the existence of more\nthan one omnipresent Self. In reply to the assertion, that because Brahman is\none and there are no other Selfs outside it, Brahman must be subject to\nfruition since the individual soul is so, we ask the question: How have you,\nour wise opponent, ascertained that there is no other Self? You will reply, we\nsuppose, from scriptural texts such as, 'That art thou,' 'I am Brahman,'\n'There is no other knower but he,' and so on. Very well, then, it appears that\nthe truth about scriptural matters is to be ascertained from Scripture, and\nthat Scripture is not sometimes to be appealed to, and on other occasions to\nbe disregarded.\n\np. 116\n\nScriptural texts, such as 'that art thou,' teach that Brahman which is free\nfrom all evil is the Self of the embodied soul, and thus dispel even the\nopinion that the embodied soul is subject to fruition; how then should\nfruition on the part of the embodied soul involve fruition on the part of\nBrahman?--Let, then, the unity of the individual soul and Brahman not be\napprehended on the ground of Scripture.--In that case, we reply, the fruition\non the part of the individual soul has wrong knowledge for its cause, and\nBrahman as it truly exists is not touched thereby, not any more than the ether\nbecomes really dark-blue in consequence of ignorant people presuming it to be\nso. For this reason the Sutrakara says 1 'no, on account of the difference.'\nIn spite of their unity, fruition on the part of the soul does not involve\nfruition on the part of Brahman; because there is a difference. For there is a\ndifference between false knowledge and perfect knowledge, fruition being the\nfigment of false knowledge while the unity (of the Self) is revealed by\nperfect knowledge. Now, as the substance revealed by perfect knowledge cannot\nbe affected by fruition which is nothing but the figment of false knowledge,\nit is impossible to assume even a shadow of fruition on Brahman's part.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[116:1](sbe34045.htm#fr_144) Another interpretation of the later part of\nSutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 9](sbe34046.htm)\n\n"
