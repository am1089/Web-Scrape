May the man who holds the sacrificial ladle and kindles thee, O Agni, who\nthrice prepares food for thee on this day, victoriously overcome (his foes)\nthrough his lustre, wise through the power of thy mind, O _G_ atavedas.\n\n2 [1](sbe46101.htm#an_4:12:2:1). He who toiling brings fuel to thee, doing\nservice to thy, the great (god\'s) face, O Agni, kindling thee at evening and\nat dawn--he prospers, obtains wealth, and destroys his enemies.\n\n3\\. Agni is master of mighty royal power [1](sbe46101.htm#an_4:12:3:1); Agni\n(is master) of gain, of the highest wealth. He, the youngest, self-dependent\n(god) in the right way distributes treasures to the mortal worshipper.\n\n4\\. Whatever sin, O youngest (god), we have committed against thee in\nthoughtlessness, men as we are [1](sbe46101.htm#an_4:12:4:1), make thou us\nsinless before Aditi; release us from (every) guilt on all sides, O Agni!\n\n5\\. Even from great guilt, O Agni, from the prison of gods and of mortals--let\nus, thy friends, never be harmed; grant luck and weal to kith and kin.\n\n6 [1](sbe46101.htm#an_4:12:6:1). As you formerly have released, O Vasus, the\nbuffalo cow bound by the foot, O worshipful gods, thus take away from us this\ndistress. May, O Agni, our life be further prolonged.\n\np. 355\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 4 = TS. IV, 7, 15, 6; MS. III, 16, 5.\nVerse 5 = MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 6 = TS.

Ges., XLVIII, 114.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Grassmann is right in giving to purushatra\xc2\xb4 the meaning \'unter den\nMenschen,\' and in observing with reference to our passage: \'wo die Bedeutung\n"nach Menschenweise" (s. purushata) besser passt.\' The same is the opinion of\nBohtlingk-Roth. No doubt we should read purushata; cf. VII, 57, 4 = X, 15, 6.\nyat va _h_ a\xc2\xb4ga _h_ purushata karama; IV, 54, 3. a _k_ itti yat _k_ ak _ri_\nma\xe2\x80\xa6. purushatvata.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1.
