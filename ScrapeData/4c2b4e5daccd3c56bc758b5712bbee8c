Thee, O Agni, the treasure-lord of treasures, I gladden at the sacrifices,\nO king! May we, striving for gain, conquer gain through thee; may we overcome\nthe hostilities of mortals.\n\n2\\. Agni, the bearer of oblations, our ever-young father, is mighty,\nbrilliant, beautiful to behold among us. Shine (on us) food with a good\nhousehold [1](sbe46108.htm#an_5:4:2:1). Turn all glory towards us\n[2](sbe46108.htm#an_5:4:2:2).\n\n3\\. Establish Agni as the Hot _ri_ , the sage of the clans, the lord of human\nclans, the bright purifier, whose back is covered with ghee, the omniscient.\nMay he obtain the best goods (for us) among the gods.\n\n4\\. Enjoy thyself, O Agni, joined with I _d_ a, uniting thyself with the rays\nof the sun. Enjoy our fuel, O _G_ atavedas, and bring the gods hither that\nthey may eat our offerings.\n\n5\\. Welcome, as our household-god and the guest in our dwelling, come to this\nour sacrifice as the knowing one. Dispelling, O Agni, all (hostile) attempts,\nbring to us the possessions of those who are at enmity with us.\n\n6\\. Drive away the Dasyu with thy weapon, creating strength for thy own body.\nWhen thou bringest the gods across (to us), O son of strength, then, O\nmanliest Agni, protect us in (our striving for) gain.\n\n7\\. May we worship thee, O Agni, with hymns, with offerings, O purifier with\nglorious light. Stir for us wealth with all goods; bestow on us all riches!\n\np. 376\n\n8\\. Enjoy, O Agni, our sacrifice, our offering,\n\nO son of strength who dwellest in three abodes. May we be well-doers before\nthe gods. Protect us with thy thrice-protecting shelter.\n\n9\\. Bring us across all difficulties and dangers,\n\n8\\. _G_ atavedas, as with a boat across a river. Agni, being praised with\nadoration as (thou hast been praised) by Atri, be a protector of our bodies.\n\n10\\. When I, the mortal, call thee, the immortal, thinking of thee with humble\nmind [1](sbe46108.htm#an_5:4:10:1), bestow glory on us, O _G_ atavedas; may I\nattain immortality, O Agni, with my offspring.\n\n11\\. The well-doer to whom thou, O Agni _G_ atavedas, createst pleasant\nfreedom, will happily attain wealth with horses and sons, with valiant men and\ncows.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 1 = TS. I, 4, 46, 2. Verse 2 = TS. III, 4,\n11, 1; MS. IV, 12, 6; 14, 15. Verse 5 = AV. VII, 73, 9; TB. II, 4, 1, 1; MS.\nIV, 11, 1. Verse 9 = TB. II, 4, 1, 5; T\xc3\x82. X, 2, 1; MS. IV, 10, 1. Verses 10,\n11 = TS. I, 4, 46, 1.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. According to the traditional text, su-garhapatya\xc2\xb4 _h_ must be an\nepithet of isha _h_. But the conjecture of Bohtlingk-Roth, su-garhapatya _h_ ,\nhas great probability 'as the good protector of our household, shine food on\nus.' Cf. AV. XII, 2, 45 = TB. I, 2, 1, 20.\n\nNote 2. The second hemistich is nearly identical with III, 54, 22.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. See Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 221.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 5. \xc3\x82pri Hymn.](sbe46109.htm)\n\n"
