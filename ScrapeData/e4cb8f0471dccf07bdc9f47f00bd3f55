I call for you Agni, shining with beautiful shine, praised with beautiful\npraise [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:1:1), the guest of the clans, the receiver of\nfine offerings, who is desirable like Mitra (or, like an ally), _G_ atavedas\nthe god, among godly people.\n\n2\\. The Bh _ri_ gus worshipping him in the abode of the waters\n[1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:2:1) have verily [2](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:2:2)\nestablished him among the clans of \xc3\x82yu. Let him surpass all worlds, Agni, the\nsteward of the gods [3](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:2:3), the possessor of quick\nhorses.\n\n3\\. The gods have established beloved Agni among the human clans as (people)\ngoing to settle (establish) Mitra [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:3:1). May he\nilluminate the nights that are longing (for him), he who should be treated\nkindly by the liberal (worshipper) in his house.\n\n4\\. His prosperity is delightful as good pasture (?)\n[1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:4:1); delightful is his appearance when the burning\none is driven forward, he who quickly shaking his tongue among the plants\nwaves [2](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:4:2) his tail mightily like a chariot-horse.\n\n5\\. When they praised [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:5:1) to me the monstrous might\nof the eater of the forests [2](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:5:2), he produced his\n(shining) colour as (he has done) for the U _s_ i _g_ s\n[3](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:5:3). With shining splendour he has shone joyously, he\nwho having grown old has suddenly become young (again).\n\n6\\. He who shines on the forests [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:6:1) as if he were\nthirsty, who resounded like water on its path, like (the rattle of the wheels)\nof a chariot [2](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:6:2)--he whose\n\np. 203\n\npath is black, the hot, the joyous one has shone, laughing\n[3](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:6:3) like the sky with its clouds.\n\n7\\. He who has spread himself burning over the wide (earth), moves about like\nan animal, free, without a keeper. The naming Agni, burning down the\nbrushwood, with a black trail [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:7:1), has, as it were,\ntasted the earth.\n\n8\\. Now in the remembrance of thy former blessings this prayer has been\nrecited to thee at the third sacrifice [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:8:1). Give to\nus, Agni, mighty strength with a succession of valiant men, with plenty of\nfood; (give us) wealth with good progeny [2](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:8:2).\n\n9\\. Give, O Agni, such vigour to thy praiser together with his liberal\n(lords), that the G _ri_ tsamadas, rich in valiant men, victorious over\nhostile plots, attaining (their aim) in secret, may overcome through thee\n(their rivals) who get behind [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:9:1).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Somahuti Bhargava, the metre Trish _t_ ubh.--No verse occurs\nin the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. To me there seems to be no doubt that the meaning of suv _ri_ kti is\nsomething like 'beautiful prayer,' beautiful song,' and then 'a god who is\ninvoked with beautiful songs.' Thus suvriktaya _h_ or other cases of the same\nword stand by the side of stoma _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 gira _h_ , VIII, 8, 22; of gira _h_ , I,\n64, 1; VIII, 96, 10, comp. X, 64, 4; of brahma, VII, 31, 11; 97, 9; of stomai\n_h_ , VII, 96, 1; of dhitibhi _h_ , VI, 61, 2; of a _k_ _kh_ oktibhi _h_\nmatina\xc2\xb4m, I, 61, 3, and so on. Comp. also VII, 83, 9. hava\xc2\xb4mahe vam v _ri_ sha\n_n_ a suv _ri_ ktibhi _h_ ; X, 41, 1. ratham \xe2\x80\xa6 suv _ri_ ktibhi _h_ vayam\nvy\xcc\x83ush _t_ a ushasa _h_ havamahe; X, 80, 7. avo _k_ ama suv _ri_ ktim.\n\np. 204\n\nThis being the meaning of the word, I cannot think it probable--and herein I\ndiffer from the opinion pronounced by Prof. Max Muller, vol. xxxii, p. 109--\nthat it stands in connection with the verb v _ri_ _g_ in its well-known use\nreferring to the Barhis. In my opinion (comp. also Geldner, Vedische Studien,\nI, 151) suv _ri_ kti may be connected with another use of v _ri_ _g_ , with\nthe meaning of this verb 'to draw a god towards himself, averting him from\nother sacrificers' (materials regarding this use of v _ri_ _g_ have been\ncollected by Geldner, loc. cit., 144). Or possibly the word may be derived, as\nProf. von Roth believes, from _ri_ _k_ (comp. suvita derived from i). It is\ntrue that the substantive _ri_ kti does not occur by itself: but, as Prof. Max\nMuller remarks (loc. cit.), this would not be fatal to Prof. von Roth's\netymology, because many other words in the Veda occur as uttarapadas only. If\nwe accept this theory, we should of course have to separate suv _ri_ kti from\nnamov _ri_ kti and svav _ri_ kti.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. X, 46, 2. imam vidhanta _h_ apa\xc2\xb4m sadhasthe.\n\nNote 2. Literally, 'doubly.' 'In two places, in the abode of the waters and\namong the clans of man.' M. M. Compare, however, X, 46, 2 (see last note).\n\nNote 3. Deva\xc2\xb4nam arati _h_ ; comp. I, 58, 7, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The meaning seems to be that people going to settle anywhere, secure\nsafety by ceremonies addressed to Mitra, i. e. possibly by concluding\nalliances which stand under the special protection of Mitra. Comp. IV, 33, 10;\nH. O., Religion des Veda, 186, note 1.--Mitra is kshetrasa\xc2\xb4dhas, VIII, 31, 14.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Svasya-iva seems to be corrupt. Possibly we might read suyavasa-iva\npush _t_ i _h_. In X, 11, 5 we read, sada asi ra _n_ va _h_ , yavasa-iva\npushyate. IV, 16, 15. oka _h_ na ra _n_ va\xc2\xb4 sud _r i_ _s_ i-iva push _t_ i\n_h_.--The translation of the traditional\n\np. 205\n\nreading would be, 'His prosperity is delightful, like that of a person\nbelonging to us.'\n\nNote 2. Bharibhrat seems to be a participle: but then dodhaviti must be\naccented (dodhaviti).\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. On the verb pan, comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 199 seq.\n\nNote 2. Vanad seems to be, as Grassmann has seen, a compound of van, 'the\nforest' (comp. the genitive vana\xc2\xb4m, the locative va _m_ su), and of ad. Of\nAgni is said several times 'vanani atti.'\n\nNote 3. On the mythical ancestors designated as the U _s_ i _g_ as, see\nBergaigne, I, 57 seq.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The forests, of course, are the fuel.\n\nNote 2. To rathya-iva probably _k_ akra\xc2\xb4 (nom. plur.) is to be supplied.\n\nNote 3. The 'laughing' of the sky is the lightning (Benfey, Vedica und\nVerwandtes, 138). The flames of Agni flash through the smoke as the lightning\nshines in the clouds.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, II, 29 seq.; Roth, Zeitschrift der\nDeutschen Morgenland. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 107.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The text has t _ri_ ti\xc2\xb4ye vidathe (comp. I, 31, 6, note 2). Does this\nmean at the t _ri_ tiya-savana? Three vidathas are spoken of also in VI, 51,\n2; VII, 66, 10.\n\nNote 2. On the metrical irregularity, comp. H. O., Die Hymnen des Rig-veda, I,\n67.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. 'May prevail, destroying through thee the neighbours lying in ambush.'\nM. M. To me guha seems to be connected with vanvanta _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 5](sbe46055.htm)\n\n"
