Venkataramanan, [1921], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 85\n\n### The Century of Verses.\n\nThere is no known comparison in all the three worlds for the venerable teacher\nthat bestows knowledge. If the philosopher\'s stone be assumed as such, it only\nturns iron into gold, but, alas! cannot convert it into philosopher\'s stone.\nThe venerable teacher, on the other hand, creates equality with himself in the\ndisciple that takes refuge in his feet. He is therefore peerless, nay, even\ntranscendental. (1)\n\np. 86\n\nJust as, by virtue of the fragrance diffused by a sandal tree, other trees\naround it are also full of fragrance at all times and afford shelter from heat\nto diverse beings, so do they that have derived wisdom from the teacher, with\nhearts full of mercy, emancipate, by their teachings, all those who are\nfortunate enough to stand in their presence, from the three kinds of misery *\nand the three kinds of sin. \xe2\x80\xa0 (2)\n\np. 87\n\nAt the outset is enunciated the perception of the self and of the not-self by\nmeans, respectively, of true knowledge and illusion. Thus does scripture speak\nof the knowledge of Brahman as two-fold, namely, by means of experience\nrelating to oneself ( _sv anubhuti_) and by conclusive certainty ( _upapatti_\n). The former arises in correlation to bodily limitation, while the latter\narises out of universality; at first springs up the experience "I am Brahman",\nand then "All this is Brahman." (3)\n\nThe nature of the self is consciousness. knowledge and bliss. It can be known\nby direct realisation. It. is the inspiring soul in all bodies, (senses), etc.\nAnd yet, the utterly ignorant person mistakes the transient body for the soul,\nalthough he knows again and\n\np. 88\n\nagain that the body, whether his own or another\'s, is externally composed of\nbones, tendon, marrow, flesh, blood, nerves, skin and fat, and internally full\nof ordure, urine and phlegm. (4)\n\nAll these beings spend the whole of their valuable life-time on earth as\nfollowers of the philosophy of the flesh, imagining: "The body, wife, sons,\nfriends, servants, horses, cattle,--these are the sources of my happiness."\nThey fail to understand that inner, immortal Lord of Life, by whom they live,\nby whom they are rendered fit for the duties of life and by whom they are\nendowed with prosperity. (5)\n\np. 89\n\nJust as a sagacious insect (e, g., the silkworm) builds, by its own efforts, a\ncocoon around itself and, jointly therewith, moves about throughout its life\nin the discharge of its activities, so does the individual soul, by means of\nthe fruits of various actions, build up a physical body and, remaining\ntherein, move about along with it, day by day, on earth. (6)\n\nDoes a person who assumes the mask of a tiger for his livelihood and frightens\nthe young ones, injure any man, beast or other living being, under the\nimpression that he is a tiger? Or, does the actor, playing a woman s part,\npant for a husband, imagining himself to be a woman? So is the self\nconditioned by\n\np. 90\n\nthe body, but, being different from the body and from experience, is only the\nwitness. (7)\n\nJust as a mother, in order to pacify her child that has been weeping for a\nvery long time, places before it a grape, a date, a mango, or a good plantain\nfruit, so well has the upanishad, by various teaching expedients, enlightened\nthe utterly ignorant mind that wanders restlessly in consequence of the\nfaculty of delusion acquired in numerous lives. (8)\n\nThat self, by reason of which being dear, all things like the body, wife,\nchildren and\n\np. 91\n\nwealth, are dear, must itself be dearer than those things. Those things, on\nthe other hand, are sources of misery. How, then, can they be dearer (than the\nself)? For the sake of saving one\'s own life, one gives up even his wife and\nothers, and, for the good of one\'s own. self, one gives up even one\'s own\nbody. The wise should therefore cherish the self as the most beloved and not\nanything else. (9)\n\nAs long as one derives pleasure from an object, so long is it beloved; and as\nlong as it gives rise. to pain, so long is it disliked. Neither pleasantness\nnor unpleasantness resides at all times in the same object. Sometimes what is\nunpleasant might become pleasant, and what is very pleasant might become\nunpleasant.\n\np. 92\n\n[paragraph continues] The reality known as the self is, therefore; the most\nbeloved at all times. (10)\n\nWhat is preferable in the world and what is pleasant are each said to be of\ntwo kinds, namely, that which is actuated by desire and that which is\nabsolute. That which is actuated by desire is the sole source of sorrow and\nbecomes insipid in an instant; it is sought after by the ignorant. Brahman\nalone is the absolute, being the repository of unsurpassed bliss; therein do\nthey that know the truth take refuge. This is declared in the six divisions (\n_vall i_) of the Kathopanishad. (11)\n\np. 93\n\nFeeling, while going about, that he is a wave of the ocean of the self: while\nsitting, that he is a bead strung on the thread of universal consciousness:\nwhile perceiving objects of sense, that he is realising himself by perceiving\nthe self: and, while sleeping, that he is drowned in the ocean of bliss;--he\nwho, inwardly constant, spends his whole life thus, is, among all men, the\nreal seeker of liberation. (12)\n\nAll this world, consisting of name and form, is only the particular\nmanifestation ( _vyaskti_ ) of the universal -Substance ( _vir aj_); it moves\n\np. 94\n\nand knows all objects by virtue of the primal life ( _mukhya-pr ana_) that\ninspires it. This self, like the sun, is neither the doer nor the enjoyer.--\nThus, directly realising, does he that is full of knowledge and realisation\nlive his life, through incessant contemplation of the supreme self. (13)\n\nNon-attachment ( _vair agya_) is declared to be of two kinds, namely, that\nwhich springs from disgust ( _nirveda_ ) and that which is inspired by\nknowledge. The former arises from the observation that desires, such as for\nhome or friends or sons or wealth, generally end in sorrow; while the latter\nis the rejection of the above-mentioned things, by virtue of the wisdom\nimparted, as if they were vomitted matter. Renunciation too is of two kinds\nfor those of\n\np. 95\n\nsubdued mind, namely, that of the body and that of the home. (14)\n\nEvery one in all the three worlds strives for happiness and not at all fur\nmisery. The two sources of misery are the sense of I-ness in the body and the\nsense of mine-ness, arising therefrom, in the objects of one\'s own\nconsciousness; for, even the learned man undergoes suffering from disease or\nassault by mistaking the transient body for the self, and experiences extreme\nsorrow at the loss of wife, son or wealth, but not at the loss of an enemy. *\n(15)\n\np. 96\n\nAlthough dwelling in the house as the head of the family, he who is devoid of\nthe feeling of mine-ness remains therein like a guest longing to reach his\ndestination, * and feels not, with fervour, the happiness or the misery\nresiding in the body. What must happen, whether it be the body or anything\nelse, will surely happen, and what must be lost, will surely be lost, like the\ngathering of clouds. He who knows this truth remains at ease. (16)\n\nHe who, by strength of will, escapes from his own home like a snake out of its\nslough, might occasionally attend to the sustenance of his body like a\ntraveller resorting to the shade\n\np. 97\n\nof a wayside tree, but should only beg of trees so much food, in the shape of\nfruits fallen of their own accord, as would be enough to appease his hunger.\nHe should also go forth from his body in order to enter the garden of his own\nself that is full of bliss. (17)\n\nThere first arises, in the mind, desire. It then directs the mind to various\nobjects. The mind then grasps those objects through the medium of the senses.\nWhen an object is not attained, there springs up anger. When an object is\nattained, there arises greed in the shape of eagerness to preserve that\nobject. These three are the cause of every one\'s ruin. The .wise should\ntherefore shun them by constant meditation upon the self. (18)\n\np. 98\n\nThat is a gift which is made by men as a dedication to Brahman; patience is\nthe absence of anger; faith is the belief in the existence of the self; and\nthe reality is Brahman ( _sat_ ). The four opposites of these are known as the\nbarriers ( _setu_ ), and tend to the bondage of every being. One should\ntherefore overcome these barriers by means of the four gifts, etc., aforesaid,\nand should thereby attain happiness, immortality, heavenward progress, and the\nrealisation of the light. (19)\n\np. 99\n\nFood that is dedicated to the Lord and to guests tends to immortality;\notherwise, the food is useless. So, too, food that is cooked for one\'s own\nsake is said to be one\'s death. He, too, among men, who eats by himself\nbecomes wholly sinful in this world. And he, too, who eats daily without the\nprescribed consecration of the food to the fire of life, remains a mortal.\n(20)\n\nHe alone, in the world, is the giver who offers food to the famished mendicant\nthat comes to his house. To such an one there is plenty of food for sacrifice,\nand he becomes one that has no enemy. He, on the other hand, who does not\noffer food even to the friend that has constantly served him with attachment\nfor the sake of food, is not a\n\np. 100\n\nfriend. From such a miser one should be anxious to turn away, as it were, out\nof disregard. (21)\n\nThe manifestation and the dissolution of the universe have, for their\nrespective cause, the ignorance or the knowledge of the self, and are\napplicable to all beings from the creator ( _hiranya-garbha_ ) downwards,--so\ndo the Vedas declare. When the self is realised, the universe is sacrificed *\ninto Brahman, and, when the self is not realised, this Brahman is again\nsacrificed * into the universe, in the same way as the (illusory) silver\ndisappears into the mother-of-pearl and the real substance (the\n\np. 101\n\nmother-of-pearl) into the (illusory) silver owing Ito the non-recognition of\neach of them in turn. (22)\n\nThen was not non-entity, that being absolutely non-existent like the sky-\nflower; nor was then any entity that could divide. But something then was,\ndifferent from these two. Then was not the universe as it (now) exists in its\nphenomenal condition; and yet it already existed differently, as the\n(illusory) silver already exists in the mother-of-pearl. Nor was then the\nprimordial (cosmic) substance ( _vir at_) sprung from ether. For, what is\nthere, like unto the water produced by magic, that can veil the unconditioned\nself? * (23)\n\np. 102\n\nIf there was no bondage in the shape of origin and dissolution, neither was\nthere liberation; just as there is neither night nor day in the sun, for, it\nis only a limitation of vision. The One, motionless and unconditioned, then\nbecame, by its own power of illusion ( _m aya_), that which is known as the\nmaker ( _kartri_ ) *. And there was naught else than that. That alone, veiled\nby the unborn \xe2\x80\xa0, became the individual soul. (24)\n\np. 103\n\nIn the beginning was darkness, * as an entity. Thus veiled by darkness, naught\ncould then be seen, like the water that is contained-in milk. The birth of\nthis universe, consisting of name and form, was by virtue of the will of the\nCreator desiring to create,--this will being induced by the actions ( _karma-\nbhih_ ) of a continuous ( _anugata_ ) universe constantly inspired by minds\nthat are also continuous in a germinal form. (25)\n\nThis (goddess of) illusion ( _m aya_) has four crests \xe2\x80\xa0. She is always fresh\nand therefore ever young. She is skilful, because she is an expert in\naccomplishing even the impossible. She is sweet-mouthed \xe2\x80\xa1 at the outset. Thus,\n\np. 104\n\ntoo, she veils the knowledge derivable from the _upanishads_. In her dwell,\nlike two birds, the supreme self and the individual soul, for, they alone make\nall things manifest. (26)\n\nOf these two, the former remains unattached, while the latter, on the other\nhand, falling into the ocean of ignorance and forgetting the real nature of\nthe self, perceived the apparition of these various worlds. But no sooner has\nhe turned his consciousness within himself than the unborn ( _m aya_),\nabandons him and he abandons her. There is, thus, One only. But the wise,\nsomehow, render that One variously by their teachings. * (27)\n\np. 105\n\nThe inner self neither comes in at the time of birth nor goes away at the time\nof death; for, it is infinite. But it is the mind with the subtle body that\nenters thus and goes forth afterwards. The mind does not reproduce in itself\nthe leanness or the stoutness of the gross body. But it departs, taking with\nit the two sets * of tendencies ( _samsk ara_) and the measures of light (\n_tejo-m atrah_) \xe2\x80\xa0, and returns again to this world along with these very\nappendages. (28)\n\np. 106\n\nThere was, of old, a venerable Brahma\xe1\xb9\x87a, named Subandhu, who was the priest of\n(king) Sanati; he having died by the deceitful incantations of some Brahma\xe1\xb9\x87as,\nhis mind went to (the abode of the god of) death, and his brother brought it\nback by means of Vedic hymns,--so says the Veda. It follows from this that the\nmind alone, as related to the self, goes forth and not the inner self in any\ncase. (29)\n\nThe one motionless self moves with the wandering mind, remains in it, and is\nalso both before and behind it. But although it is\n\np. 107\n\nthus present throughout, the eye and other senses know it not. Water, for\ninstance, moves about with the rolling waves raised by the wind, is in them\nand before them and behind them; and when the waves are still, it is as it\never is. (30)\n\nThe inner self was, at first, by itself. Then it seeks objects of enjoyment\none after another: "Let me have wife and [children](errata.htm#4) and wealth\nto support them." For their sake the man works with very many difficulties\neven at the risk of his life and does not deem anything-else to be higher or\ngreater than them. Even if any one of them is not gained, he feels himself to\nbe incomplete and is as inactive as if he were dead; so, too, even if any one\nof them is lost, he feels he has entirely missed his purpose. (31)\n\np. 108\n\nThe cloud that hides the huge sun leas not existed (ever) before nor will\nexist (ever) thereafter, but is visible only during that interval. And it\nobstructs the vision of the spectator and not the solar orb; for, if it were\nnot so, how can the group of clouds be visible without the sun? In this manner\ndoes the universe ( _visva_ ) * veil the understanding and not the supreme\n(self) that is its \xe2\x80\xa0 own illuminer and inspirer. (32)\n\np. 109\n\nHaving, in dream, ruled a kingdom with all the glories thereof, one does not,\non waking thereafter, feel sorry that he has lost his kingdom, knowing, as he\ndoes, that it was unreal. Nor does one become liable to punishment by\ncommitting adultery or other evil deed in dream. So will it be, if one should\nforget all the activities of his waking state like dreams. (33)\n\nThe pleasure or pain experienced in the dream-state becomes unreal on waking,\nand the objects towards which the activities of the physical body are directed\nin the waking state become unreal during sleep. But, although unreality is\nthus established in both ways, the ignorant person still clings to it *,\nalthough its\n\np. 110\n\nilluminer is the self ( _satya_ ). Surely, we are not aware why this should be\nso. (34)\n\nOne is filled with sudden grief on seeing the death, in one\'s dream, of a\nrelation that lives in one\'s waking state. So, too, does one feel happy by\nseeing alive, in dream, one that was dead in the waking state. And although\none remembers (in dream) the death or the life of the individual (in one\'s\nwaking condition), he nevertheless converses with him. This being so, reality\nor unreality depends only on the length or shortness of time. * (35)\n\np. 111\n\nAlthough the pleasure of meeting a woman in dream is extremely unreal, yet the\ndischarge resulting therefrom is visible. In the same way does the universe\nappear as almost real although it has sprung from unreality. The man in the\n(above) dream may be real, but the woman and her company are only unreal, and\nyet the cloth is actually soiled in the morning by the discharge. All this\nuniverse, therefore, has imagination ( _kalpan a_) * for its root-cause. (36)\n\np. 112\n\nAll persons witness the sport of this (self) every day in the dream-state, and\nyet no one sees that (self) itself sporting with illusion ( _m aya_) without\nany of the organs of sense *. Nor does any one realise it, in the waking\nstate, as the illuminer of all objects and the inspirer of all creatures, nor,\nin deep sleep, as that which is full of supreme bliss. This is wonderful! (37)\n\nThe revelation of a sacred word ( _mantra_ ) heard in dream becomes real on\nwaking; and as the result of a benediction in dream, the desired object is\nactually attained in the morning. Thus the real may spring up even from the\nunreal. \xe2\x80\xa0 Further, that (self) alone is self-resplendent by which are\nmanifested all\n\np. 113\n\nanimate and inanimate things, the entire variety of perceivable objects, nay,\nthe whole universe itself. (38).\n\nIn deep sleep, fire, the sun and others * are merged in the medial life (\n_madhya-pr ana_ \xe2\x80\xa0) which is their source, and speech and others in the life-\nbreath. Therefore is it declared that the cessation is of these senses and not\nof the breath. The appearance of objects through those senses (in the waking\nstate) is known to be an illusion like that of silver in the \xe1\xb9\x83other-of-pearl.\nThe practice of the control of life-forces enunciated in the Vedanta is\ntherefore the only means of realising one\'s own self and not any other. \xe2\x80\xa1\n(39).\n\np. 114\n\nFire does not touch wet fuel even exceptionally, but only fuel that has been\ndried in the sun. So, too, the fire of knowledge does not touch the mind that\nis wet with attachments although it has acquired merit by the performance of\nprescribed duties, the preservation of progeny and gifts of wealth, but only\nthe mind that is dried by non-attachment. Therefore is pure non-attachment\ntaught foremost, for, by it is the success of realisation. (40).\n\np. 115\n\nWhatever is of the nature of name and form, whatever moves in this world,\nsprings up as a mere unreality and should be veiled off by the Lord by whom it\nis manifest and by whom it is multifariously active, in the same way as the\n(illusory) snake is veiled off by the rope that is definitely known. (Only) by\nabandoning that (unreality) can unsurpassed bliss be enjoyed. Do not therefore\ncovet any other thing like wealth, etc. (41).\n\nTo the aspirant for liberation there first comes liberation while living and\nthen ultimate liberation. These two are the result of constant practice and\nrealisation, which are only attainable by the contact of the teacher\'s feet\nand his merciful glance. Practice, too, is of two kinds according to\nqualification, namely, bodily and mental. Bodily practice consists\n\np. 116\n\nof postures ( _a sana_), etc., while the other, previously explained as the\npath of knowledge, consists of abstention ( _uparati_ ). (42).\n\nHaving rooted out all desires abiding in the heart as if their pegs were\nforcibly broken, he loses all attachment to the body and gives up his\nwaywardness, his attention being wholly given to the self. Then will he of\naccumulated merit reach the highest abode * which is variegated by dark, white\nand red veins \xe2\x80\xa0 and wherein ambrosia flows in plenty, and enjoy the bliss of\nthe self. (43).\n\np. 117\n\nSuch a person, while in this body, passes beyond sorrow, ignorance and other\nimpediments and sees the universe as the self. * He then attains the shining\nBrahman \xe2\x80\xa0 and becomes all-knowing and the repository of all occult powers.\nAfterwards, losing all sense of the gross, subtle and other bodies and devoid\nof all volition, he attains the fourth state \xe2\x80\xa1, and, purged of all merit and\ndemerit, attains liberation even in this life. \xc2\xa7 (44).\n\np. 118\n\nAs a result of such realisation of the self, there springs up the youthful\nlife * which, although encased in a body and the senses, is unaffected by\nboyhood, old age and other bodily attributes, and is extremely blissful and\ncapable of accomplishing the highest goal. It is this life \xe2\x80\xa0 that is led up \xe2\x80\xa1,\nalong with the purified consciousness, by those of supreme wisdom and\nunfailing resolution, who seek to become divine by spiritual practices. (45).\n\nSuch a one is almost without desire, for temptations have lost all power over\nhim. He pants only for the realisation of the self for\n\np. 119\n\nthe sake of its unsurpassed bliss. When he realises the self, he has attained\nall his desires, * and, remains in the final condition. \xe2\x80\xa0 When the body dies,\nthe life-breaths do not rise therefrom \xe2\x80\xa1, but are gradually dissolved in their\nrespective causes. Then, where will the individual soul be, for it will be\nmerged, like salt in water, and is then the Infinite Self itself? (46).\n\nWater taken from the sea, when solidified, goes by the name of salt. When it\nis thrown back into the sea and is dissolved, it loses its name and form. So\ndoes the individual soul merge into the Supreme Self. At the same time, the\nmind is dissolved into the moon,\n\np. 120\n\nspeech into fire, sight into the sun, blood and semen into water and hearing\ninto the directions. (47).\n\nJust as butter is contained in milk as indicated by the sweetness of the\nlatter, but (when extracted) becomes separate therefrom, so too is Brahman in\nevery being as indicated by the activity of the being. This (Brahman) is the\ncause of rest when one is tired. * Attaining it, one discards all other gain\nas straw. Therein springs up no fear. The concentrated bliss which thus glows\nwithin oneself is immortality. All else is transient. (48).\n\np. 121\n\nThe many-coloured cloth is woven, crosswise and lengthwise, of threads of many\ncolours. When this is understood, there remains nothing of the cloth but the\nthreads. So is the manifold universe, with its mountains, cities, men,\nvillages, beasts, etc., pervaded through and through, by the primordial\nsubstance *, that again by ether, and the latter by Brahman. (49).\n\nThis (Brahman), by virtue of its reflection by various objects \xe2\x80\xa0, assumes the\nvarious corresponding forms, in the same way as the one seer produces a second\none (by reflection)\n\np. 122\n\nin water. The Veda too speaks thus of the all-pervading Brahman: "The\nresplendent one with its powers of illusion, has infinite forms on all sides."\nThe Brahman, therefore, becomes the individual soul by its accidental\nreflection in the extremely clear consciousness. (50).\n\nThe knowers of the self discover, by their wisdom, that the individual soul, *\nbesmeared by illusion, is only a ray of the omnipotent Supreme Self reflected\nin the ocean of consciousness. This Brahman is variously reflected in\naccordance with the form and measure of the medium reflecting it, in the same\nway that the face is variously reflected corresponding\n\np. 123\n\nto the mirror in hand; but it is at all times what it ever is. * (51).\n\nJust as the one sun, independent of other objects, yet, by virtue of\nreflection in several waters, becomes \xe2\x80\xa0 many and has the same stability or\nmotion as the medium reflecting it; so does the Supreme Self seem to be\naffected by properties \xe2\x80\xa1 by virtue of its reflection in all beings, high and\nlow, but, when clearly realised, shines unaffected by those properties. (52)\n\np. 124\n\nJust as the rays of the sun reflected by the moon or focussed by a metallic\nreflector dispel the utter darkness of the night or of the (interior of the)\nhouse as the case may be, so do the rays of the Supreme Self reflected by the\nconsciousness and streaming forth through the outlets of the senses,\nimmediately reveal to us the objects of perception around us, such as forms,\netc. (53)\n\nThe Supreme Self has three aspects, namely, the full, the self and the not-\nself, the first being the unconditioned Self, the second being that which is\nconditioned * by the consciousness,\n\np. 125\n\nand the third being a mere reflection, in the same way as space has three\naspects in respect of water, namely, that which is (everywhere) inside and\noutside of the water, that Which is conterminous with the water, and that\nwhich is reflected therein. When the conditioned self is merged in the\nunconditioned, then the condition * together with its consequences \xe2\x80\xa0 vanishes\naltogether. (54)\n\nJust as countless wooden figures of women, acted upon by means of posts and\nstrings, simultaneously exhibit music and all other activities of common\noccurrence \xe2\x80\xa1, so does the world, including the regions of _bh ur_, _bhuvar_ ,\n_svar_ and _mahar_ , carry on all its activities by the inspiration of what is\nknown as the\n\np. 126\n\n_s utra-atman_ *, which pervades everything, whose potency is unique and whose\ninspiration is in proportion to the end to be achieved. (55).\n\nThat is real which is unaffected at all times. \xe2\x80\xa0 Such are the unembodied\nthings like life, space, ether. Even these ultimately resolve themselves \xe2\x80\xa1\ninto Brahman; hence is Brahman the reality of the real. There is naught else\nwhich excels it in its transcendentality or its infinitude; therefore is it\ntermed the reality of the real. The lower \xc2\xa7 that is conditioned by embodied\nand unembodied things is called satya **, because it is both _sat_ and _tyat_.\n\xc2\xb6 Of this too, Brahman is the reality. (56).\n\np. 127\n\nWhatever unreal thing is, in every-day experience, perceived, like silver (in\nmother-of-pearl), serpent (in rope) and water (in mirage), depends for its\nperception on the real. This rule, with its limitation *, is well-established.\nSo has this whole universe sprung into existence in \xe2\x80\xa0 Brahman, the reality of\nthe real. That too is called the real by virtue of which the unreal becomes an\nobject of perception. (57).\n\np. 128\n\nThe material Brahman *, known as _virat_ , is such that the expanse of space,\ntime, and the farthest extremities of the directions, are but infinitesimal\nparts thereof, and yet it appears to be so close at hand and face to face.\nFrom that arose the _s utra-atman_ \xe2\x80\xa0, greater than the great, fuller than the\nfull, in the same way as the commingled water of the (seven) oceans \xe2\x80\xa1 is\nfuller than the full ocean, etc. \xc2\xa7 (58).\n\nJust as the one rain-water inside all herbs is transformed variously according\nto the numberless tastes, odours, properties and effects of the respective\nherbs, so is the inner self ** according\n\np. 129\n\nto the characteristics of the various kinds, of beings. By (virtue of) it does\nthe earth support all creatures, the clouds rain profusely, fire cooks and\nburns. Hence is that the inner (self) of all. (59)\n\nOne should clearly realise the self in all beings and all successive\nmultitudes of created beings in the self. He should, repeatedly and\npersistently, perceive all things as the self, having, for an example, the\nrelation between water and waves. * There is only one Brahman without a\nsecond, as is declared by the Vedanta. The many do not in any way exist. But\nhe who sees this universe as manifold passes from death to death. \xe2\x80\xa0 (60)\n\np. 130\n\nIn spite of the knowledge that the atmosphere exists all around the pot, there\narises in men the false impression that it has its origin along with the pot,\ndisappears when the pot is broken, moves with the pot when it is removed\nelsewhere, and assumes the same size and shape as the pot. So is the self in\nrespect of the universe. (61).\n\nAs much as is a lump of sugar, so much is nothing but sweetness. As much as a\npiece of camphor melts, so much is nothing but\n\np. 131\n\nsweet fragrance. So, too, as far as the universe is manifest, with all the\nbeauty of trees, mountains, cities, gardens and temples, so far does the one\n(pure) consciousness shine forth, for, in the end all that remains of the\nuniverse is the self. (62).\n\nAlthough the hearing of the sound proceeds from the musical instrument, it is\nnevertheless produced only by striking the instrument. The sounds that proceed\nfrom striking the instrument are not heard separately but only in conjunction\nwith the striking. So, too, this universe, whose efficient cause is illusion (\n_m aya_), is manifest, as it were, in conjunction with Brahman. But when that\nBrahman is inwardly realised, nothing will remain the object of perception.\n(63).\n\np. 132\n\nIt is thus clearly seen that the Lord of all the worlds is of the nature of\npure consciousness, is the one Immovable that is knowledge itself, is all-\npervading like ether, and is the inner spirit of all beings. It is also seen\nthat all this universe is different from Brahman, is unreal by nature, and is\na mere semblance. One should, therefore, even now and here, give up all\ndesires and remain for ever fixed in the thought "I am Brahman". (64).\n\nWhen Indra and Indrani have freely enjoyed the bliss of union, the cessation\nof their pleasure\n\np. 133\n\nis deep sleep. * Therein is a state that is fall of concentrated bliss and\nvery difficult to comprehend; that is the _a nanda-kosa_ (the bliss-sheath).\nIn that condition one is not conscious of anything, being deeply merged in\nunsurpassed bliss. If awaked, he becomes unhappy. A wise man should therefore\nnever awake a sleeping person. (65)\n\nAll beings \xe2\x80\xa0 enjoy bliss by attaining Brahman ( _yasas_ ) which embraces\nwithin itself the eye and other sensory organs and which externally helps all\nperception. All individual souls are alike in nature as in deep sleep. \xe2\x80\xa1 Among\n\np. 134\n\nthese, he who, for the sake of feeding the belly, remains only externally\nactive and is enslaved by the senses of touch, sight, hearing, smell and\ntaste, becomes tainted with sin and suffers misery and confusion. (66).\n\nThe individual soul, during the waking state, puts forth innumerable efforts\nfor the attainment of sensual pleasures, and when the entire group of sensory\norgans is fatigued, it forgets even the pleasure on hand and goes into sleep,\nin order that it may enjoy rest in its own nature. Ultra-sensual bliss is thus\nextremely easy of attainment and is far superior to the pleasure derived from\nthe senses which always produces disgust in the end. (67).\n\np. 135\n\nThe bird, by the motion of its wings, generates a breeze and, by its aid,\nreaches a great height, and there, having attained the vast expanse of the\natmosphere, cures itself of its fatigue by spreading its wings. So, too, this\nmind, troubled by many evil desires and doubts in respect of objects of\npleasure, and fatigued thereby, stretches forth the hands and feet and sleeps\nlong for the sake of rest. (68).\n\nThe moment that the individual soul comes into union with the self (Brahman)\n*, it ceases to be conscious of anything, internal or external, like unto a\nlover fervently embracing his\n\np. 136\n\nbeloved one on his return home from a foreign land. In that state all\n[worldly](errata.htm#5) activity that is the result of merit and demerit,\ndisappears, and nothing is remembered of all these ups and downs,--sorrow,\nconfusion, or fear. (69).\n\nThe disappearance of all gross and subtle existence, the cessation of the\nsenses, and the attainment of bliss,--these three are common to liberation-\nwhile-alive and deep sleep. There is however this difference that, whereas he\nwho is asleep comes back to life again and again * by virtue of the effects of\nhis past actions, he that has attained illumination and liberation, never\ncomes back (to worldly life), because the effects of all his past actions have\nbeen destroyed. (70).\n\np. 137\n\nIf the bliss of a king endowed with all prosperity and enjoying every kind of\nhappiness be taken as a unit, the bliss of the _manes_ is declared to be a\nhundredfold. So, too, through the world of the gods higher and higher up to\nthe world of Brahman, each (bliss) is a hundredfold of the next lower one.\nSingular and containing within itself all these (grades of bliss) is the bliss\nof (the supreme) Brahman, of which the pleasures of the senses are but an\n(insignificant) fraction. (71).\n\np. 138\n\n"Therein are included all degrees of bliss,--the bliss of men ( _a nanda_), of\nthe manes ( _moda_ ), of gods ( _pramoda_ ), etc. Therein all desires are\nfulfilled. Therein is the state of oneness owing to the cessation of all\n(phenomena). Make me live immortally for ever, O Soma *, in that abode of\nconcentrated bliss, and vouchsafe to my soul \xe2\x80\xa0 that is betwixt the brows an\nunceasing shower of immortality, \xe2\x80\xa1"--so do the Vedas declare. (72).\n\nThe self is unperturbed and its nature is bliss; the other ( _m aya_) is quite\nthe opposite; their steadiness or perturbation bears fruit in the individual\nconsciousness. The perturbation of the mind, until a desired object is gained,\n\np. 139\n\ngives rise to misery. When that object is-gained, the pleasure (said to be)\nderived from that object is only so long as the mind remains steady. (73)\n\nJust as there is a momentary bliss when the mind is absorbed in pleasure at\nthe end of a sensual indulgence, so too there is unsurpassed bliss in deep\nsleep only so long as there is steadiness (of consciousness). In liberation,\nhowever, the consciousness is absolutely tranquil and there is eternal bliss.\nThere is thus a constant relation between bliss and steadiness. It is\ntherefore proper to speak of sensual pleasure as a fraction of eternal bliss.\n(74).\n\np. 140\n\nThe mind, tired of external activities, draws them all in together, and\ncarrying with it the tendencies resulting from them, ceases from them and\nturns inward in search of its own place. In the dream-body, it enjoys dream-\nobjects generated by the combination of those tendencies. Abandoning these,\nagain, it longs for the inner self, reaching which it attains perfect rest. *\n(75).\n\n \xe2\x80\xa0 "How is the enjoyment of pleasure, etc. possible in dream, while the\ninstrument therefor\n\np. 141\n\n[paragraph continues] (the gross body) is inert? If (it be said that) a new\ndream-body fit for such activity springs up, wherefrom does it arise, since\nthe means of its generation * is absent? If it be a product of the\nimagination, then how is it that, after the experience of sexual pleasure in a\ndream, the effect thereof is (actually) visible in the body that is inert?\n(76).\n\n"It is with this (the gross body) that he weeps from fear, talks, laughs and\nexults." It \xe2\x80\xa0 surely follows from this that the inner self does not abruptly\nsever its connection with the body during dream, although that body is inert;\nbut, with the help of the subtle body, it creates again, in subtle form, those\nobjects\n\np. 142\n\nwhich it had previously * experienced, such as the body, woman, horse, tiger,\nlocality, etc. (77).\n\nThe second state, that of dream, is known by experience to be midway between\nwaking and sleep. In that state the individual, having withdrawn all the\nsenses, has only the light of the self remaining. The gross body having been\nlaid down on a suitable bed, the inner self, experiencing the objects it likes\nin their subtle form, goes about as it pleases in the same manner. \xe2\x80\xa0 (78).\n\np. 143\n\nPreserving the body lying in bed by means of the life-forces now reduced to\nmere breath, lest it assume the form of a corpse and become food for dogs,\netc., it creates, in dream, by its own power, horses, chariots, rivers, ponds,\nplaygrounds, companions, women, sons, friends,--all by way of imitation. *\n(79).\n\nIt creates elephants, tigers, robbers, enemies, snakes and monkeys. Sometimes\nit is playing with beloved damsels. Sometimes it laughs and sports. Sometimes\nit eats delicious food. At other times it is afraid of its kith and kin,\nbecause it has become an outcaste. And at other times it runs away for fear of\ntigers, etc. or is caught by them and wails. (80).\n\np. 144\n\nWhatever object is perceived, it comes into existence then and there by the\nignorance of the true nature of the self that is in it. Its manifestation is\nlike the unreal appearance of false silver owing to one\'s not recognising the\nmother-of-pearl, or of the mirage owing to one\'s not recognising the sun\'s\nrays, or of the serpent by one\'s not recognising the rope,--such appearance\ngiving rise to joy or fear, only for an instant. Hence all this universe is\nreally created by perception. * (81).\n\np. 145\n\nThe Lord of the Universe has declared: "By me, on whom depends the illusion of\n_m aya_ all this (universe) has been spread forth. Therefore, all things are\nin me, not I in them; for instance, although silver appears (falsely) in the\nmother-o\'-pearl, there is naught of the mother-o\'-pearl in silver. Therefore,\n* too, all things do not (in reality) exist in me." It follows from this that\nthe whole objective world is as unreal as the products of jugglery. (82).\n\nAction is the only cause of happiness or misery in this world. The ignorant,\nnot knowing this, speak in vain of friend or enemy. \xe2\x80\xa0 Yag\xe1\xb9\x87avalkya, and\n\xc3\x81rtabhaga of yore, in the palace of king Janaka, spoke only\n\np. 146\n\nof action and praised it. Even the ornament * of the race of Yadu declares:\n"None in this world remains without action." (83).\n\nAlthough the axe is able to fell a tree, it should nevertheless be wielded by\na living being. Food is, no doubt, a source of satisfaction, but the real\ncause thereof is the effort \xe2\x80\xa0 of the eater. In the same way, former action is\nthe cause of the good or evil results experienced; yet, being itself\nevanescent, it cannot do this by itself. It is impelled thereto by the inner\nself. (84).\n\np. 147\n\nThe Vedas declare, with much propriety, that all rites, compulsory,\ndiscretionary, and so on, which are laid down by the Smriti for the various\ncastes and conditions of men, are (in reality) dedicated to the Supreme Self\n*; in the same way that, by the satisfaction of the nose, eyes, tongue, hands,\nfeet, head and ears, it is the inner man that is actually satisfied, and, by\nthe watering of the roots of a tree, every part of that tree is nourished.\n(85).\n\nAfter death, he who is ignorant of the self, although versed in the Vedas, and\nhas performed the rites prescribed therein, exhausts his\n\np. 148\n\nmerit after a brief enjoyment and undergoes very great misery in having to be\nborn again. He who has realised the self and yet longs for reward, enjoys much\ngreater and more lasting happiness accompanied by supernatural powers.\nTherefore, one should indeed realise the self; for, by realising it, one gains\nevery happiness although he longs for no reward. (86).\n\nIt is no wonder that objects are not revealed by the sun, moon, etc., of their\nown accord nor is the sun directly perceived by its own light, nor the moon,\nnor fire. On the other hand, the sun, moon, etc., are perceived by means of\nthe sense of sight inspired by (the inner) consciousness. Therefore, only the\ndweller in the body shines by his own light.\n\np. 149\n\n[paragraph continues] Yet, in the World, * the, deities \xe2\x80\xa0 have their\nrespective power to illuminate. (87).\n\nThrough the life-force called _pr ana_ the individual drinks plenty of water\nand eats food Then the abdominal fire, with energy derived from, that ( _pr\na\xe1\xb9\x87a_), digests it sooner or later. Thereafter the life-force known as _vy ana_\ncarries the essence along the blood-vessels of the whole body for the\nnourishment of life; and the life-force termed _ap ana_ expels from the body\nthe putrid non-essence. (88).\n\np. 150\n\nThis life, with its five-fold energy *, residing in each body and being master\nof all the senses, distinctly and incessantly carries on all the activities\nappropriate to that particular body, by a power which belongs undoubtedly to\nthe self that is pure consciousness. That self am I, the all-seer, the life\nbehind all life, the consciousness behind the consciousness of all beings.\n(89).\n\nBy the light of that One Self that is pure consciousness, the earth, water,\nair, sun, moon, etc., shine after It, each with its peculiar\n\np. 151\n\ncharacteristics, and have their being in It. Can the flashes of lightning and\nflaming conflagrations and the vast expanse of starry galaxies illumine the\nSupreme Lord, the immutable, infinite light, the seer, without beginning and\nwithout end, eternal, because devoid of origin? (90).\n\nIf, by the favour of the nectar-like glance, full of unparalleled mercy, of\nthe venerable holy Master, there arises, in any man whatsoever, the\nrealisation "That very Brahman am I," he indeed loses all feelings of doubt\nand, with his mind free from illusion, attains liberation even while living in\nthe body. (Thereafter), when the beginningless limitation * is completely\ndissolved, he is merged in the Highest, the sole abode of eternal bliss. (91)\n\np. 152\n\nI am neither the dense body nor the senses, nor the evanescent and most\nerratic mind, nor reason, nor life, nor the ego, nor wife, nor house, nor\noffspring, nor kith and kin, nor land nor wealth, and so on. For, how can I,\nthe witness aloof, the pure consciousness, the inner self, be all these things\nwhich are purely objective? I am the Supreme * that is the reality behind all\nthis Universe. (92).\n\nIn relation to all these plainly visible forms of dark, yellow and other\ninnumerable colours,\n\np. 153\n\nthe eye, which is one, is the seer, for, therein arises the perception. The\neye, in its turn, is only objective, because the mind is its seer. And even\nthe workings of the mind, objective forms transformed into thought, are, in\ntheir turn, objective. The Lord alone is the absolute seer, the witness, for,\nHe is never, like the above, objective. (93).\n\nOwing to the non-recognition of a rope in the twilight, over it appears a\nserpent all at once. In the sane way is the extremely unhappy condition of the\nindividual soul imposed on the self by reason of the non-realisation of one\'s\nown self. Again, when the illusion of a serpent is dispelled by the admonition\nof a trustworthy friend, there is only the old familiar rope. So, too, by the\nadmonition of my own Master, I am not\n\np. 154\n\nthe individual soul, but the immutable Self that is the seer. I am the Supreme\nBliss ( _\xe1\xb9\xa2 iva_.) (94).\n\nTell me what is thy light. You say: "The sun in the day and the moon, lamp,\netc., at night." It may be so, but by what light do you see the sun, the lamp,\netc? You say: "the eye." But when that is closed, what brighter light is\nthere? You reply: "the mind." By what light is the mind revealed? "For that, I\nalone am the light," you say. You are therefore that Supreme Light. "I am, my\nMaster." (95).\n\np. 155\n\nSuch a one * after remaining on the earth for a time, never more returns to a\nbody and its accompaniments; until the enjoyment of the ripe fruits of his\nformer actions is completed, he lives in a peculiar manner, but blissfully,\nbecause his mind is free from all contrasts \xe2\x80\xa0, ever pure, devoid of my-ness\nand I-ness, always contented, identical in nature with infinite bliss, steady\nin thought, imperturbable, cleansed of all illusions. \xe2\x80\xa1 (96).\n\nSuch an absolutely resplendent realisation at once destroys the distinction\nbetween the individual soul and Supreme Self. In whomsoever such an unimpeded,\nunparalleled realisation springs up in consciousness, for him\n\np. 156\n\nthe root-illusion ( _m aya_) that is the source of births and deaths, is\ndestroyed by that very realisation. Once destroyed, it can no more create\nillusions by its power of phenomenal manifestation. (97).\n\nKnowing that the universe is unreal and bluing, therefore, completely\ndestroyed all perception of phenomenal forms, he should taste, to his heart\'s\nutmost content, the morsel of immortal bliss that is the highest and most\nperfect concentration of being and consciousness, and, filled with the light\nof the self and with a tranquil mind, he should realise that all this universe\nis unessential and should therefore abandon it, in the same way as one, after\ndrinking the juice of a fruit, throws it away although the remnant may be\nhighly fragrant. (98).\n\np. 157\n\nThe results of actions are destroyed, the bondage of the heart is broken, and\nall doubts, which lead one to births, and deaths, are removed, as soon as one\nrealises that Supreme Lord, whose nature is pure consciousness, who is devoid\nof the stain of qualities, who is realisable by such teachings as "That thou\nart," the immutable inner self, the Brahman, the Lord, that is beyond all\ncommandments and beyond all thought. (99).\n\np. 158\n\nOne should understand the huge tree of phenomenal existence, which bears the\nfruits of births and deaths before, betwixt and after, whose roots are the\nresults of past actions, whose countless leaves are delusions, vanities, joys\nand sorrows, whose branches are desire, anger, etc., and on which dwell the\nbirds of sons and cattle, wives and daughters, in large numbers. Such a wise\nman should fell this tree down with the axe of non-attachment and should at\nall times meditate upon the Supreme Being ( _v asudeva_). (100).\n\nThe whole universe is born in me, has its support in me and dissolves in me.\nTherefore, that very Brahman indeed am I. Again, humbly and exultingly do I\nbow to that Immutable Being ( _achyuta_ ), by whose mere\n\np. 159\n\nremembrance any defective procedure in all auspicious acts like sacrifices is\nrendered perfectly complete. (101).\n\n\n\nThus ends the Century of Verses.\n\n_______\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[86:*](wos07.htm#fr_62) _Adhy atmika_ or bodily ailments, _a dhibhautika_ or\ndanger from other beings such as wild animals, and _a dhidaivika_ or danger\nfrom forces of nature such as earthquakes, floods, etc.\n\n[86:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos07.htm#fr_63) Sins of body, speech and mind.\n\n[95:*](wos07.htm#fr_64) Because there is no I-ness or mine-ness in the case of\nan enemy.\n\n[96:*](wos07.htm#fr_65) The Brahman.\n\n[100:*](wos07.htm#fr_67) These two sacrifices stand respectively for the\ndissolution of the manifest or apparent into the unmanifest or real, and the\nopposite process of the unmanifest seemingly becoming the manifest.\n\n[101:*](wos07.htm#fr_68) This verse deals with the cause of the universe,\n_i.e._ , what was before creation.\n\n[102:*](wos07.htm#fr_69) Otherwise known as _hiranyagarbha_.\n\n[102:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos07.htm#fr_70) _M aya_.\n\n[103:*](wos07.htm#fr_71) _Ajn ana_, nescience.\n\n[103:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos07.htm#fr_72) _I.e._ , eminent qualities.\n\n[103:\xe2\x80\xa1](wos07.htm#fr_73) _Ghrit asya_, lit. ghee-mouthed, i.e., tempting at\nfirst but finally leading to ruin.\n\n[104:*](wos07.htm#fr_74) For purposes of instruction, and not as representing\nthe ultimate truth.\n\n[105:*](wos07.htm#fr_75) Good and evil.\n\n[105:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos07.htm#fr_76) The five senses of perception and the life-forces in\ntheir subtlest form.\n\n[108:*](wos07.htm#fr_77) Appearance or phenomenal existence.\n\n[108:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos07.htm#fr_78) Of the universe.\n\n[109:*](wos07.htm#fr_79) Bodily enjoyment.\n\n[110:*](wos07.htm#fr_80) The seeming reality of waking experiences and the\nunreality of dreams are distinguished only by the difference of their\nduration.
