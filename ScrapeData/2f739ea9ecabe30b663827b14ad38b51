Too late, too late!  \nThe king my sire will meet his fate.  \nAnd when my sire has passed away,  \nMost happy in their lot are they,  \nAllowed, with every pious care,  \nPart in his funeral rites to bear.  \nAnd O, may we with joy at last,--  \nThese years of forest exile past,--  \nTurn to Ayodhya's town to dwell  \nWith him who keeps his promise well.'  \n\nWhile thus the hero mighty-souled,  \nIn wild lament his sorrow told,  \nFaint with the load that on him lay,  \nThe hours of darkness passed away.  \nAs thus the prince, impelled by zeal  \nFor his loved brother, prompt to feel  \nStrong yearnings for the people's weal,  \n   His words of truth outspake,  \nKing Guha grieved to see his woe.  \nHeart-stricken, gave his tears to flow,  \nTormented by the common blow,  \n   Sad, as a wounded snake.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LII.: The Crossing of Ganga.](ry130.htm)\n\n"
