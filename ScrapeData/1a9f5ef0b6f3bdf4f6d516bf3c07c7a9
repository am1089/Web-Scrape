Thus the vital airs.\n\nIn the third pada it has been shown that a conflict of Vedic passages as to\nether, &c., does not exist. The same is now done in this fourth pada with\nregard to the vital airs. On the one hand the chapters treating of the origin\nof things do not record an origin of the vital airs; so e.g. ( _Kh_. Up. VI,\n2, 3) 'It sent forth fire,' &c.; and (Taitt. Up. II, 1) 'From that Self sprang\nether,' &c. On the other hand it is said expressly in some places that the\nvital airs were not produced. The following passage, e.g. 'Non-being indeed\nwas this in the beginning; they say: what was that non-being? those _ri_ shis\nindeed were the non-being in the beginning; they say: who are those _ri_ shis?\nthe vital airs indeed are the _ri_ shis' ( _S_ at. Br. VI, 1, 1, 1), states\nthat the vital airs existed before the origin of things.--In other passages\nagain we read of the origin of the vital airs also, so e.g. 'As small sparks\ncome forth from fire, thus do all vital airs come forth from that Self' (B\n_ri_. Up. II, 1, 20); 'From that is born the vital air, mind, and all organs\nof sense' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3); 'The seven vital airs also spring from him' (Mu.\nUp. II, 1, 8); 'He sent forth the vital air; from the vital air _s_ raddha,\nether, air, light. water, earth, sense, mind, food' (Pr. Up. VI, 4). Hence as\nthere is a conflict of scriptural passages, and as no reason can be made out\nfor deciding in favour of either alternative, the purvapakshin thinks that\neither no opinion can be formed, or that the passages relative to the origin\nof the vital airs must be taken in a metaphorical sense, since scripture\nexpressly states the pra _n_ as to have existed before the creation.\n\nIn reply to this the author of the Sutras says, 'thus the\n\np. 75\n\npra _n_ as.'--What then, it will be asked, is the fitness of the word 'thus,'\nas there is no point of comparison with the matter under discussion? The\nmatter under discussion at the conclusion of the preceding pada was the\nrefutation of those who maintain a plurality of omnipresent Selfs, and with\nthis no comparison can be instituted because there is no similarity. For a\ncomparison is possible only where there is similarity; as when we say, e.g.\n'as a lion so is Balavarman.' Possibly it might be said that the comparison is\nmeant to intimate similarity with the ad _ri_ sh _t_ a.; the meaning being\nthat as the ad _ri_ sh _t_ a is not limited because it is produced in\nproximity to all Selfs, so the pra _n_ as also are not limited with regard to\nall the different Selfs. But, on that explanation, the Sutra would be an idle\nrepetition, as it has already been explained that that absence of limitation\nis due to the non-limitation of bodies.--Nor can the pra _n_ as be compared\nwith the individual soul, because that would be contrary to the conclusion\nabout to be established. For it has been shown that the individual soul is\nwithout an origin, while the intention is to declare that the pra _n_ as have\nan origin. Hence it appears that the word 'so' is devoid of connexion.--Not\nso, we reply. A connexion may be established by means of a comparison based on\nthe exemplifying passages. Under that category fall those passages which state\nthe origin of the pra _n_ as, as e.g. 'From that Self come forth all pra _n_\nas, all worlds, all gods, all beings' (B _ri_. Up. II, 1, 20); which passage\nmeans that as the worlds and so on are produced from the highest Brahman so\nthe pra _n_ as also. Such passages also as (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3) 'From him are\nborn pra _n_ a, mind and all organs of sense, ether, air, light, water, and\nthe earth the support of all,' are to be considered as intimating that the\norigin of the pra _n_ as is analogous to that of the ether, &c.--Or else, as a\nconnexion with a somewhat remote object of comparison is resorted to in such\ncases as the one treated of in Pu. Mi. Su. III, 4, 32 ('and the accident in\ndrinking Soma, in the same manner') 1, we may construe our Sutra in the\nfollowing\n\np. 76\n\nway: in the same way as ether and so on, which are mentioned in the beginning\nof the preceding pada, are understood to be effects of the highest Brahman, so\nthe pra _n_ as also are effects of the highest Brahman. And if it be asked\nwhat reason we have for assuming the pra _n_ as to be so, we reply: the fact\nof this being stated by scripture.--But it has been shown above that in some\nplaces the origin of the pra _n_ as is not mentioned.--That is of no weight,\nwe reply, as it is mentioned in other places. For the circumstance of a thing\nnot being stated in some places has no power to invalidate what is stated\nabout it in other places. Hence, on account of equality of scriptural\nstatement, it is proper to maintain that the pra _n_ as also are produced in\nthe same way as ether and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[75:1](sbe38055.htm#fr_51) The 'tadvat' in the quoted Sutra refers not to the\nimmediately preceding adhikara _n_ a but to Sutra III, 4, 28.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 2](sbe38056.htm)\n\n"
