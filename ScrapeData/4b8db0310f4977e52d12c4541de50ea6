Witnesses.\n\n* 147. 147 In doubtful cases, when two parties are quarrelling with one another, the truth has to be\n\np. 80\n\ngathered from (the deposition of) witnesses, whose knowledge is based on what\nhas been seen, heard, or understood by them.\n\n148. 148 He should be considered as a witness who has witnessed a deed with his own ears or eyes; with his ears, if he has heard another man speaking; with his eyes, if he has seen something himself.\n\n* 149. 149 Eleven descriptions of witnesses are distinguished in law by the learned. Five of them are termed appointed, and the other six not appointed.\n\n* 150. 150 A subscribing witness, one who has been reminded, a casual witness, a secret witness, and an indirect witness, these are the five sorts of appointed witnesses.\n\np. 81\n\n* 151. 151 The witnesses not appointed by (the party) himself have been declared sixfold: viz. the village, a judge, a king,\n\n152\\. One acquainted with the affairs of the two parties, and one deputed by\nthe claimant. In family quarrels, members of that family shall be witnesses.\n\n153. 153 They shall be of honourable family, straightforward, and unexceptionable as to their descent, their actions, and their fortune. The witnesses shall not be less than three in number, unimpeachable, honest, and pure-minded.\n\n154. 154 They shall be Brahmans, Vai _s_ yas, or Kshatriyas, or irreproachable _S_ udras. Each of these shall be (witness) for persons of his own order, or all of them may be (witnesses) for all (orders).\n\n* 155. 155 Among companies (of artizans, or guilds of\n\np. 82\n\nmerchants, other) artizans or merchants shall be witnesses; and members of an\nassociation among other members of the same association; persons living\noutside among those living outside; and women among women.\n\n* 156. 156 And if in a company (of artizans or guild of merchants) or in any other association any one falls out (with his associates), they must not bear witness against him; for they all are his enemies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[79:147](sbe3318.htm#fr_242) When the plaintiff and defendant in a lawsuit\nquarrel p. 80 about a doubtful affair of any sort, the truth has to be\nascertained by examining the statements of the witnesses, who have seen, or\nheard, or been present at, the transaction. A.\n\n[80:148](sbe3318.htm#fr_243) Manu VIII, 74; Vish _n_ u VIII, 13.\n\n[80:149](sbe3318.htm#fr_244) Definitions of the eleven witnesses are given in\nthe following paragraphs. A.\n\n[80:150](sbe3318.htm#fr_245) 'A subscribing witness,' i.e. one by whom a\ndocument is attested. 'A secret witness,' one who concealed in a house or room\nlistens to the discourse of the parties. A. Katyayana defines the technical\nterms in this paragraph as follows: 'One adduced by the claimant himself,\nwhose name is inserted in the deed, is a subscribing witness. A reminded\nwitness is not entered in a deed. He is called a reminded witness who in order\nto insure the publicity of a transaction is reminded of it again and again by\nthe claimant. One purposely brought near, and one who happened to be on the\nspot accidentally, are two witnesses not entered in a deed, by whom a claim\nmay be corroborated. One who standing concealed is caused, for the purpose of\nestablishing the claim, to hear distinctly the statements of the defendant, is\ntermed a secret witness. One who subsequently corroborates the statements of\nother witnesses, whether from his own knowledge, or from hearsay, is called an\nindirect witness.'\n\n[81:151](sbe3318.htm#fr_246) 151, 152. The village or the co-villagers shall\nbe witnesses in a transaction which has taken place within the village. The\ntestimony of the judge shall be heard in regard to a cause tried in a court of\njustice. The king shall be witness concerning a transaction which has taken\nplace in his presence. These, and one acquainted with the circumstances of\nboth parties, the agent of the claimant, and members of a family in a lawsuit\nconcerning that family, are the six kinds of witnesses not appointed. A.\n\n[81:153](sbe3318.htm#fr_247) 'Of honourable family,' belonging to a noble\nrace. 'Straightforward,' habitually veracious. 'Less than three,' viz. one or\ntwo persons may be witnesses if both parties consent to it. In a dispute\nregarding landed property, more than three witnesses are required. 'Honest,'\nfree from avarice. 'Pure-minded,' imbued with the precepts of religion. A.\nManu VIII, 62, 63; Vish _n_ u VIII, 8; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 11, 29, 7; Gautama XIII,\n2; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 68, 69; Vasish _th_ a XVI, 28.\n\n[81:154](sbe3318.htm#fr_248) Members of these four castes shall be witnesses\nfor members of their own caste only. Or let members of any caste be witnesses\nfor members of any other caste. A. Manu VIII, 62; Gautama XIII, 3; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya II, 69; Vasish _th_ a XVI, 29; Baudhayana I,19, 53.\n\n[81:155](sbe3318.htm#fr_249) Companies or guilds are of eighteen kinds.\nLabourers p. 82 for hire shall be witnesses for other members of the same\nassociation. Outcasts shall be witnesses for other low-caste persons. Women\nshall be witnesses where two women quarrel with one another. In all these\ncases, the qualities of the witnesses need not be tested. A. Manu VIII, 68;\nVasish _th_ a XVI, 30.\n\n[82:156](sbe3318.htm#fr_250) If in a company of traders any one member should\ncontract an enmity towards the other members of it, they are unworthy to bear\ntestimony against or about him, on account of their enmity towards him. Here\nends the chapter on witnesses, the tenth section of the law of debt. A.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 12. Incompetent Witnesses](sbe3319.htm)\n\n"
