[1894], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n5:2:2\n\n### SECOND BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n5:2:2:11\\. He now proceeds with the Barhaspatya pap. Its svish _t_ ak _ri_ t\nremains yet unoffered, when he (the Adhvaryu) brings 2 him (the Sacrificer)\nsome food; for he who offers the Va _g_ apeya wins food, va _g_ apeya being\nthe same as anna-peya: thus whatever food he (the Sacrificer) has thereby\ngained, that he (the Adhvaryu) now brings to him.\n\n5:2:2:22\\. In a vessel of udumbara wood--the Udumbara tree being sustenance,\n(that is) food--for the obtainment of sustenance, food: therefore it is in a\nvessel of udumbara wood. He first brings water, then milk, then (other) kinds\nof food, as they occur to him.\n\n5:2:2:33\\. Now some bring seventeen kinds of food,\n\np. 37\n\nsaying, 'Seventeenfold is Pra _g_ apati.' But let him not do so: surely all\nthe food is not appropriated to Pra _g_ apati 1, and, compared to him, what is\nman that he should appropriate to himself all food? Hence, while bringing\nevery kind of food that occurs to him, let him not bring of some one\n(particular) kind of food.\n\n5:2:2:44\\. And whatever food he does trot bring to him, let him (the\nSacrificer) forswear 2 that, and not eat of it as long as he lives: thus he\ndoes not go to the end, thus he lives long. Of all that food brought together\nhe offers the (seven) Va _g_ a-prasavaniya 3 oblations, cutting out (pieces)\nwith the dipping-spoon. Thus to whatever deities he is now offering, they give\nan impulse to him, and impelled by them he\n\np. 38\n\nwins: therefore he offers the Va _g_ aprasavaniya oblations.\n\n5:2:2:55\\. He offers with (Va _g_. S. IX, 23-29), 'The impulse of strength\nimpelled of old that king Soma in the plants, in the waters: may they be rich\nin honey for us! may we be wakeful in the kingdom, placed in the front, hail!'\n\n5:2:2:66\\. 'The impulse of strength spread over this sky, and over all these\nworlds, as the all-ruler; knowing he causeth him to give gifts who wisheth not\nto give: may he bestow upon us wealth with the full muster of heroes, hail!'\n\n5:2:2:77\\. 'Yea, the impulse of strength prevailed over all these worlds, on\nevery side; from days of yore the king goeth about knowing, increasing the\npeople, and the well-being amongst us, hail!'\n\n5:2:2:88\\. 'To king Soma, to Agni we cling 1 for help, to the \xc3\x82dityas, to Vish\n_n_ u, to Surya, to the Brahman B _ri_ haspati, hail!'\n\n5:2:2:99\\. 'Urge thou Aryaman, B _ri_ haspati, Indra to the giving of gifts,\nVa _k_  2, Vish _n_ u, Sarasvati, and the vigorous Savit _ri_ , hail!'\n\n5:2:2:1010\\. 'O Agni, speak to us here, be thou gracious unto us! bestow\nblessings upon us, O winner of thousands, for thou art the giver of wealth,\nhail!'\n\n5:2:2:1111\\. 'May Aryaman bestow blessings upon us, and Pushan, and B _ri_\nhaspati! may the divine Va _k_ give us gifts, hail!'\n\n5:2:2:1212\\. With the remaining (offering material) he sprinkles him (the\nSacrificer); he thereby sprinkles\n\np. 39\n\nhim with food, bestows food upon him: for this reason he sprinkles him with\nthe remaining (material) 1.\n\n5:2:2:1313\\. He sprinkles with (Va _g_. S. IX, 30), 'At the impulse of the\ndivine Savit _ri_ , (I sprinkle) thee, by the arms of the A _s_ vins, by the\nhands of Pushan!' he thus sprinkles (consecrates) him by the hands of\ngods;--'I place thee in the leading of Sarasvati Va _k_ , the leader;' for\nSarasvati is Va _k_ (speech): he thus places him in the leading of Va _k_ ,\nthe leader.\n\n5:2:2:1414\\. Here now some say, 'I place thee in the leading of the leader of\nall the gods;' for all the gods are the All: he thus places him in the leading\nof the leader of the All. But let him not say so; let him rather say, 'I place\nthee in the leading of Sarasvati Va _k_ ;' for Sarasvati is Va _k_ : he thus\nplaces him in the leading of Va _k_.--'I consecrate thee, N.N., with the\nsupreme rulership of B _ri_ haspati!' therewith he mentions the (Sacrificer's)\nname: he thus makes him attain to the fellowship of B _ri_ haspati, and to co-\nexistence in his world.\n\n5:2:2:1515\\. He then says,' All-ruler is he, N.N.! All-ruler is he, N.N.!'\nHim, thus indicated, he thereby indicates to the gods: 'Of mighty power is he\nwho has been consecrated; he has become one of yours; protect him!' thus he\nthereby says. Thrice he says it, for threefold is the sacrifice.\n\np. 40\n\n5:2:2:1616\\. He then either offers, or makes him pronounce (the formulas of)\nthe U _g_ _g_ iti oblations 1. Whether he offers or makes him pronounce (the\nformulas), the significance is the same.\n\n5:2:2:1717\\. He makes him say (Va _g_. S. IX, 31-34), 'With the (word of) one\nsyllable Agni won the breath: may I win that!-- -- 2 With the (metre of)\nseventeen syllables Pra _g_ apati won the seventeenfold stoma: may I win\nthat!' whatever those deities won by means of those (formulas), that he now\nwins by them. There are seventeen (formulas), for Pra _g_ apati is\nseventeenfold: he thus wins Pra _g_ apati.\n\n5:2:2:1818\\. Thereupon he says, 'Recite (the invitatory formula) to Agni Svish\n_t_ ak _ri_ t!' Now, as to why this rite is performed between two oblations.\nPra _g_ apati, truly, is that sacrifice which is here performed, and from\nwhich these creatures have been produced,--and, indeed, they are even now\nproduced after this one: he thus wins Pra _g_ apati in the very middle:\ntherefore that rite is performed between two oblations. Having made (the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra) utter the\n\np. 41\n\n[paragraph continues] _S_ rausha _t_ , he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer\nto Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t!' and offers as the Vasha _t_ is uttered.\n\n5:2:2:1919\\. He then puts the I _d_ a on (the i _d_ apatri). The I _d_ a\nhaving been invoked 1, he, having touched water, draws the Mahendra cup.\nHaving drawn the Mahendra cup, he sets the chant agoing 2. He urges him (the\nSacrificer) forward to the chant: he gets down (from the throne-seat); he is\nin attendance at the Stotra, in attendance at the _S_ astra.\n\n5:2:2:2020\\. Here now some, having performed that, perform that 3; but let him\nnot do it thus; for the Stotra is his (the Sacrificer's) own self, and the _S_\nastra is his people (or [offspring](errata.htm#7)): thereby then he ruins the\nSacrificer; he goes astray, he stumbles;--hence having performed that, let him\nperform that:--\n\n5:2:2:2121\\. He puts the I _d_ a on (the dish). The I _d_ a having been\ninvoked, he, having touched water, draws the Mahendra cup. Having drawn the\nMahendra cup, he sets the (P _ri_ sh _th_ a-) Stotra agoing. He urges him (the\nSacrificer) forward to the chant: he gets down (from the throne-seat); he is\nin attendance at the chant (stotra), in attendance at the recitation ( _s_\nastra).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[36:2](sbe4109.htm#fr_86) He collects (sambharati), or provides food for him;\nthis ceremony corresponding to that of equipping or provisioning the sacred\nfire with the so-called sambharas, at the Agny-adhana; see II, 1, 1, 1 seq.;\npart i, p. 276, note 1.\n\n[37:1](sbe4109.htm#fr_87) Or 'from Pra _g_ apati;' or perhaps, 'surely not all\nPra _g_ apati's food is appropriated.' The Ka _n_ va recension reads thus,\n[VI, 2, 3, 3](sbe4133.htm#6:2:3:3). He first brings water, then milk, then, as\nthey occur to him (other) kinds of food. 'Let him bring those seventeen kinds\nof food,' they say, for Pra _g_ apati is seventeenfold.' Nevertheless (tadu)\nlet him bring whatever kinds of food he can either think of or obtain. 4. Of\nthis his food that has been brought together, let him set aside (uddharet) one\n(particular kind of) food: let him forswear that (tad udbruvita), and not eat\nof it as long as he lives (yava _g_ _g_ ivet). By that much also (or, even so\nlong, tavad api vai pra _g_ apate _h_ sarvam annam anavaruddham) all the food\nof Pra _g_ apati is not appropriated; and who is man (compared) to him, that\nhe should appropriate to himself all food? Thus he does not go to the end,\nthus he lives long: that (food) is here left over for his offspring (or\npeople).\n\n[37:2](sbe4109.htm#fr_88) Saya _n_ a explains 'tasya udbruvita' by,--one ought\nto proclaim it, saying aloud 'such and such food has not been brought;'--na\nsambh _ri_ tam ity u _k_ _k_ ais tannama bruyat.\n\n[37:3](sbe4109.htm#fr_89) That is, oblations calculated to promote or quicken\n(pra-su) the strength (food,--va _g_ a) by their prayers, the first three of\nwhich begin with 'va _g_ asya . . . prasava _h_.' See [p.\n2](sbe4103.htm#page_2), note [1](sbe4103.htm#fn_32). In the Black Ya _g_ us\nritual these oblations are called 'Annahoma _h_ ' or food-oblations. Taitt.\nBr. I, 3, 8, 1. The Sutras seem, however, likewise to use the term 'Va _g_\naprasavaniya' (or Va _g_ aprasaviya).\n\n[38:1](sbe4109.htm#fr_90) Rig-veda X, 141, 3 reads,--King Soma, Agni we invoke\nwith our voices, the \xc3\x82dityas, &c.\n\n[38:2](sbe4109.htm#fr_91) Rig-veda X, 141, 5 has Vata (Wind) instead of Va _k_\n(Speech).\n\n[39:1](sbe4109.htm#fr_92) According to the Taittiriyas (Taitt. S., vol. i, p.\n1049), the Sacrificer is made to sit on the black antelope skin, with his face\nto the east, with a small gold and silver plate placed on either side of him;\nand he is then sprinkled in front, on the head, so that the liquid runs down\nto his mouth, thus symbolizing the entering of food and strength into him.\n\n[40:1](sbe4109.htm#fr_93) That is, oblations of 'victory,' with the formulas\nused therewith, containing each two forms of the verb ud- _g_ i, 'to conquer.'\n\n[40:2](sbe4109.htm#fr_94) The intervening formulas here understood, and given\nin the Va _g_. Sa _m_ hita, are to the effect that the A _s_ vins, by two\nsyllables, gained the two-footed men; Vish _n_ u, by three, the three worlds;\nSoma, by four, the four-footed cattle; Pushan, by five, the five regions (the\nfour quarters and the upper region); Savit _ri_ , by six, the six seasons; the\nMaruts, by seven, the seven kinds of domestic animals; B _ri_ haspati, by\neight, the Gayatri metre; Mitra, by nine, the Triv _ri_ t stoma (hymn-tune);\nVaru _n_ a, by ten, the Vira _g_ metre; Indra, by eleven, the Trish _t_ ubh\nmetre; the All-gods, by twelve, the _G_ agati metre; the Vasus, by thirteen,\nthe thirteenfold stoma; the Rudras, by fourteen, the fourteenfold stoma; the\n\xc3\x82dityas, by fifteen, the fifteenfold stoma; Aditi, by sixteen, the sixteenfold\nstoma.\n\n[41:1](sbe4109.htm#fr_95) See I, 8, 1, 18 seq.\n\n[41:2](sbe4109.htm#fr_96) That is, the (first or Hot _ri_ 's) P _ri_ sh _th_\na-stotra, for which see above, [p. 15](sbe4105.htm#page_15), note\n[1](sbe4105.htm#fn_55); part ii, p. 339, note 2. Its chanting is followed by\nthe Nishkevalya- _s_ astra, recited by the Hot _ri_.\n\n[41:3](sbe4109.htm#fr_97) That is to say, according to Saya _n_ a,--they make\nthe Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, and the rising of the Sacrificer from the throne-\nseat, take place after the pronunciation of the 'u _g_ _g_ iti' formulas, the\ndrawing of the Mahendra cup, and the performance of the Stotra and _S_ astra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 2, 3.
