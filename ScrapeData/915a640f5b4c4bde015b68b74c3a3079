THE PI _N_ _D_ APIT _RI_ YA _G_ _\xc3\x91_ A OR OBLATION OF OBSEQUIAL CAKES\nTO THE FATHERS.\n\n2:4:2:11\\. Now the living beings once approached Pra _g_ apati--beings\ndoubtless mean creatures--and said, \'Ordain unto us in what manner we are to\nlive!\' Thereupon the gods, being properly invested with the sacrificial cord 1\nand bending the right knee, approached him. To them he said, \'The sacrifice\n(shall be) your food; immortality your sap; and the sun your light!\'\n\n2:4:2:22\\. Then the fathers approached, wearing the cord on the right\nshoulder, and bending the left knee. To them he said, \'Your eating (shall be)\nmonthly; your cordial (svadha) your swiftness of thought; and the moon your\nlight!\'\n\n2:4:2:33\\. Then the men approached him, clothed and bending their bodies. To\nthem he said, \'Your eating (shall be) in the evening and in the morning; your\noffspring your death; and the fire (Agni) your light!\'\n\n2:4:2:44\\. Then the beasts approached him. To them he granted their own\nchoice, saying, \'Whensoever ye shall find anything, whether in season or out\nof season,\n\np. 362\n\nye shall eat it!\' Hence whenever they find anything, whether in season or out\nof season, they eat it.\n\n2:4:2:55\\. Thereupon--so they say--the Asuras also straightway 1 approached\nhim. To them he gave darkness (tamas) and illusion (maya): for there is indeed\nwhat is called the illusion of the Asuras. Those creatures, it is true, have\nperished; but creatures still subsist here in the very manner which Pra _g_\napati ordained unto them.\n\n2:4:2:66\\. Neither the gods, nor the fathers, nor beasts transgress (this\nordinance); some of the men alone transgress it. Hence whatever man grows fat;\nhe grows fat in unrighteousness, since he totters and is unable to walk\nbecause of his having grown fat by doing wrong. One should therefore eat only\nin the evening and morning; and whosoever, knowing this, eats only in the\nevening and morning, reaches the full measure of life; and whatever he speaks,\nthat is (true); because he observes that divine truth. For, verily, that is\nBrahmanic lustre (te _g_ as), when one knows to keep His (Pra _g_ apati\'s)\nlaw.\n\n2:4:2:77\\. Now that (lustre) indeed belongs to him who presents (food) to the\nfathers once a month. When that (moon) is not seen either in the east or in\nthe west, then he presents (food) to them; for that moon doubtless is king\nSoma, the food of the gods. Now during that night (of new moon) it fails them,\nand when it fails, he presents (food to them), and thereby establishes concord\n(between the gods and fathers). But were he to present (food) to them when it\nis not failing, he would indeed cause a quarrel between the gods and fathers:\nhence he presents\n\np. 363\n\n[paragraph continues] (food) to them when that (moon) is not seen either in\nthe east or in the west.\n\n2:4:2:88\\. He presents it in the afternoon. The forenoon, doubtless, belongs\nto the gods; the mid-day to men; and the afternoon to the fathers: therefore\nhe presents (food to the fathers) in the afternoon.\n\n2:4:2:99\\. While seated behind the Garhapatya, with his face turned toward the\nsouth 1, and the sacrificial cord on his right shoulder, he takes that\n(material for the offering from the cart) 2. Thereupon he rises from thence\nand threshes (the rice) while standing north of the Dakshi _n_ a fire and\nfacing the south. Only once he cleans (the rice) 3; for it is once for all\nthat the fathers have passed away, and therefore he cleans it only once.\n\n2:4:2:1010\\. He then boils it. While it stands on the (Dakshi _n_ a) fire, he\npours some clarified butter on it;--for the gods they pour the offering into\nthe fire; for men they take (the food) off the fire; and for the fathers they\ndo in this very manner: hence, they pour the ghee on it while it stands on the\nfire.\n\n2:4:2:1111\\. After removing it (from the fire) he offers to the gods two\nlibations in the fire. For, in establishing his sacrificial fires, and in\nperforming the new and full-moon sacrifice, that (householder) resorts to the\ngods. Here, however, he is engaged in a\n\np. 364\n\nsacrifice to the fathers: hence he thereby propitiates the gods, and being\npermitted by the gods, he presents that (food) to the fathers. This is why, on\nremoving (the rice), he offers to the gods two libations in the fire.\n\n2:4:2:1212\\. He offers both to Agni and Soma 1. To Agni he offers, because\nAgni is allowed a share in every (offering); and to Soma he offers, because\nSoma is sacred to the fathers. This is why he offers both to Agni and Soma.\n\n2:4:2:1313\\. He offers 2 with the formulas (Va _g_. S. II, 29 a, b), \'To Agni,\nthe bearer of what is meet for the wise, svaha!\' \'To Soma, accompanied by the\nfathers, svaha 3!\' He then puts the pot-ladle on the fire,--that being in lieu\nof the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t 4. Thereupon he draws (with the wooden sword) one\nline (furrow) south of the Dakshi _n_ a fire 5,--that\n\np. 365\n\nbeing in lieu of the altar: only one line he draws, because the fathers have\npassed away once for all.\n\n2:4:2:1414\\. He then lays down a firebrand at the farther (south) end (of the\nline). For were he to present that (food) to the fathers, without having laid\ndown a firebrand, the Asuras and Rakshas would certainly tamper with it. And\nthus the Asuras and Rakshas do not tamper with that (food) of the fathers:\nthis is why he lays down the firebrand at the farther end (of the line).\n\n2:4:2:1515\\. He lays it down, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 30), \'Whatsoever\nAsuras roam about at will 1, assuming various shapes 2,--be they large-bodied\nor small-bodied 3,--may Agni expel them from this world!\' Agni is the repeller\nof the Rakshas, and therefore he lays (the firebrand) down in this way.\n\n2:4:2:1616\\. He then takes the water-pitcher and makes (the fathers) wash\n(their hands ) 4, merely 5 saying, \'N.N., wash thyself!\' (naming) the\nsacrificer\'s father; \'N.N., wash thyself!\' (naming) his grandfather; \'N.N.,\nwash thyself!\' (naming) his great-grandfather. As one would pour out water\n(for a guest) when he is about to take food, so in this case.\n\np. 366\n\n2:4:2:1717\\. Now those (stalks of sacrificial grass) are severed with one\nstroke, and cut off near the root;--the top belongs to the gods, the middle\npart to men, and the root-part to the fathers: therefore they are cut off near\nthe root. And with one stroke they are severed, because the fathers have\npassed away once for all.\n\n2:4:2:1818\\. He spreads them (along the line) with their tops towards the\nsouth. Thereon he presents [to the fathers the three (round) cakes of rice] 1.\nHe presents them thus 2;--for to the gods they offer thus; for men they ladle\nout (the food in any way they please) 3; and in the case of the fathers they\ndo in this very way: therefore he presents (the cakes to them) thus.\n\n2:4:2:1919\\. With, \'N.N., this for thee!\' he presents (one cake) to the\nsacrificer\'s father. Some add, \'and for those who come after thee!\' but let\nhim not say this, since he himself is one of those to whom (it would be\noffered) in common 4: let him\n\np. 367\n\ntherefore merely say, \'N.N., this for thee!\' as to the sacrificer\'s father;\n\'N.N., this for thee!\' as to his grandfather; and \'N.N., this for thee!\' as to\nhis great-grandfather. He presents (the food) in an order (directed) away from\nthe present time, because it is away from hence that the fathers have once for\nall departed.\n\n2:4:2:2020\\. He then mutters (Va _g_. S. II, 31 a), \'Here, O fathers, regale\nyourselves: like bulls come hither, each to his own share!\' whereby he says,\n\'Eat ye each his own share!\'\n\n2:4:2:2121\\. He then turns round (to the left), so as to face the opposite\n(north) side: for the fathers are far away from men; and thereby he also is\nfar away (from the fathers). \'Let him remain (standing with bated breath)\nuntil his breath fail,\' say some, \'for thus far extends the vital energy.\'\nHowever 1, having remained so for a moment--\n\n2:4:2:2222\\. He again turns round (to the right) and mutters (Va _g_. S. II,\n31 b), \'The fathers have regaled themselves: like bulls they have come each to\nhis own share;\' whereby he means to say, \'They have eaten each his own share\n2.\'\n\n2:4:2:2323\\. Thereupon he takes the water-pitcher and makes them wash\nthemselves 3, merely saying,\n\np. 368\n\n[paragraph continues] \'N.N., wash thyself 1!\' (naming) the sacrificer\'s\nfather; \'N.N., wash thyself!\' (naming) his grandfather; \'N.N., wash thyself!\'\n(naming) his great-grandfather. Even as one would pour out (water for a guest)\nwhen he has taken his meal, so here.\n\n2:4:2:2424\\. He then pulls down the tuck 2 (of the sacrificer\'s garment) and\nperforms obeisance. The tuck is sacred to the fathers (pit _ri_ devatya):\ntherefore he performs obeisance to them after pulling down the tuck. Now\nobeisance means worship (or sacrifice): hence he thereby renders them worthy\nof worship. Six times he performs obeisance; for there are six seasons, and\nthe fathers are the seasons: for this reason he performs obeisance six times.\nHe mutters (Va _g_. S. II, 32 g), \'Give us houses, O fathers!\' for the fathers\nare the guardians (i _s_ ate) of houses; and this is the prayer for blessing\nat this sacrificial performance. After the cakes have been put back (in the\ndish containing the remains of boiled rice) he (the sacrificer) smells at (the\nrice); this (smelling) being the sacrificer\'s share. The\n\np. 369\n\n[paragraph continues] (stalks of sacrificial grass) cut with one stroke he\nputs on the fire; and he also again throws away the firebrand 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[361:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_800) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ opavitin, \'sacrificially invested,\'\ni.e. wearing the sacrificial cord in the ordinary way, on the left shoulder\nand under the right arm. In any performance connected with the deceased\nancestors, the cord has to be shifted from the left to the right shoulder and\nunder the left arm (pra _k_ inopavitin, lit. \'eastward invested\').\n\n[362:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_801) _S_ a _s_ vat = \'repeatedly,\' Comm.; _s_ a _s_ vad\napi, \'endlich auch (at last also),\' St. Petersb. Dict.\n\n[363:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_802) Dakshi _n_ asina _h_ ; the Commentator interprets\nit by \'sitting south of the cart.\'\n\n[363:2](sbe1253.htm#fr_803) The Ka _n_ va text has,--eta _m_ _k_ aru _m_ g\n_ri_ h _n_ ati, \'he takes that pot, or potful, (of rice).\' Doubtless, he is to\ntake from the cart the quantity of rice sufficient for the offerings and put\nit in the pot ( _k_ aru). According to Katy. IV, I, 5-7 he is to take the but-\npartly-filled pot, or a spoonful (or, according to the Schol., rather less\nthan a spoonful).\n\n[363:3](sbe1253.htm#fr_804) Compare the detailed account in I, 1, 4, 1 seq.\n\n[364:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_805) According to Taitt. Br. I, 3, 10, 3, some make a\nthird oblation, viz. as Saya _n_ a states, to Yama (the chief of the fathers),\nwith the formula, \'To Yama, accompanied by the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras and fathers, svadha!\nnama _h_!\' see note 3.\n\n[364:2](sbe1253.htm#fr_806) The commentary on Katy. IV, 1, 7 supplies the\nfollowing particulars:--Having removed the pot off the Dakshi _n_ a fire on\nthe south side, the Adhvaryu takes it, along the east, to the north side of\nthe fire. He then shifts the sacrificial cord to his left shoulder (as he is\nabout to offer to gods), puts three sticks on the fire, and sitting down with\nhis face towards the east offers some boiled rice with the pot-ladle (meksha\n_n_ a).\n\n[364:3](sbe1253.htm#fr_807) The Taittiriyas use svadha! nama _h_ instead of\nsvaha! They also offer first to Soma, with \'To Soma, drank by the fathers\'\n(but cf. Taitt. Br. I, 6, 9, 5), and then to (Yama, and finally to) Agni.\nTaitt. Br. I, 3, 10, 2-3.\n\n[364:4](sbe1253.htm#fr_808) See I, 7, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[364:5](sbe1253.htm#fr_809) Or west ( _g_ aghanena) of the fire [from north to\nsouth], according to the Ka _n_ va text; optionally, according to Katy. IV, 1,\n8. Katy. also gives the text \'Expelled are the Asuras, the Rakshas, seated on\nthe altar\' (Va _g_. S. II, 29 c) to be muttered during the act.\n\n[365:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_810) Or, as the Commentator takes svadhaya,\n\'(attracted) by the svadha (offering to the fathers).\'\n\n[365:2](sbe1253.htm#fr_811) That is, according to the Schol., assuming the\nshapes of deceased ancestors.\n\n[365:3](sbe1253.htm#fr_812) This explanation of the words parapura _h_ and\nnipura _h_ , proposed by the Scholiast, is doubtful.\n\n[365:4](sbe1253.htm#fr_813) The Adhvaryu (having again shifted the sacrificial\ncord to his right shoulder) pours water through the "fathers\' space" (pit _ri_\ntirtha, i.e. the space between the thumb and fore-finger), from right to left,\ninto the line, at its beginning, centre, and end. Katy. IV, 1, 10, and Schol.\n\n[365:5](sbe1253.htm#fr_814) See paragraph 19.\n\n[366:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_815) According to the Paddhati on Katy. the first ball\nis to be of the size of a fresh amalaka, or fruit of the Emblic Myrobalan, and\neach of the two others is to be larger than the preceding one.\n\n[366:2](sbe1253.htm#fr_816) Here the teacher indicated by gesture the part of\nthe hand sacred to the fathers (see p. 365, note 4); and then in the same way\nthat dedicated to the gods, viz. the tip of the fingers.\n\n[366:3](sbe1253.htm#fr_817) The Ka _n_ va recension reads here also \'thus they\ntake out (the food) for men;\' the part of the hand dedicated to man being,\naccording to the commentary on Katy. IV, 1, 10, the part about the little\nfinger (kanish _th_ ikaprade _s_ a).\n\n[366:4](sbe1253.htm#fr_818) Svaya _m_ vai tesha _m_ saha yesha _m_ saha.\nAccording to the commentary, the author apparently means to say, that if he\nwere to add, \'and those who come after thee (i.e. after his father),\' he would\ninclude the sacrificer himself, and the latter would consequently offer the pi\n_n_ _d_ a to himself. The form of the presentation-formula rejected by our\nauthor is the one adopted in \xc3\x82 _s_ val. _S_ r. II, 6, 15, except that \'atra\'\nis added there (\'who here come after thee\'). p. 367 The Ka _n_ va text\nmentions and rejects the two alternative readings, \'ye _k_ a tvam anva _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\na _h_ \' and \'ya _m_ _s_ _k_ a tvam anva\xe1\xb9\x85 asi\' (\'and those whom thou\nfollowest\'). In Taitt. Br. I, 3, 10, no presentation-formula is mentioned at\nall.\n\n[367:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_819) The Ka _n_ va recension has tad u instead of sa\nvai.\n\n[367:2](sbe1253.htm#fr_820) \'Formerly the gods and men and fathers (deva-\nmanushya _h_ pitara _h_ ) drank visibly together, but now they do so\ninvisibly.\' _S_ at. Br. III, 6, 2, 26.\n\n[367:3](sbe1253.htm#fr_821) Viz. by pouring water on the obsequial cakes.\nAccording to \xc3\x82 _s_ val. Sr. II, 7, 5, and other treatises, he also puts down\nsome p. 368 ointment, oil, or butter on the pi _n_ _d_ as, saying, \'(Father),\nN.N., anoint thyself!\' &c.; see Donner, Pi _n_ _d_ ap., p. 25.\n\n[368:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_822) See paragraph 19.\n\n[368:2](sbe1253.htm#fr_823) Nivim udv _ri_ hya = paridhaniyasya vasaso da _s_\na tam udv _ri_ hya visra _m_ sya, Saya _n_ a. According to Mahadeva, he (who\npresents the pi _n_ _d_ as, viz. either the Adhvaryu or the sacrificer) has\npreviously to put on a garment with a tuck (nivimat paridhanam), i.e. with the\nda _s_ a, or unwoven edge of the upper garment, tucked up under the waistband.\nThis he is to pull out. Katyayana has the following rules: IV, I, 15, Having\nmade (them) wash themselves as before, and having loosened (visra _m_ sya) the\ntuck, he makes obeisance with \'adoration to your vigour, O fathers!\' &c. (Va\n_g_. S. II, 32 a-f). [According to the Comm., he adds the formula, \'Give us\nhouses, O fathers! we will give to you of what is (ours).\' Va _g_. S. II, 32,\n9.] 16, With \'Put on this your garment, O fathers!\' (Va _g_. S. II, 32 h), he\nthrows three threads (pieces of p. 369 yarn), one on each cake. 17, Or,\nwoollen fringe [or, wool or fringe (da _s_ a), according to others]. 18, Or,\nhairs of the sacrificer (pulled out from the chest near the heart), if he is\nadvanced in years. 19, He pours [the water, left in the pitcher, on the cakes]\nwith \'Ye (O waters) are a refreshing draught, ye, that bring sap, immortal\nghee and milk and foaming mead: gladden my fathers!\' (Va _g_. S. II, 34.) 20,\n[The Adhvaryu] having laid (the cakes on the dish) the sacrificer smells at\nthem. 21, The firebrand and the once-cut stalks of grass (he throws) into the\nfire. 22, The wife, if desirous of a son, eats the middle cake with, \'Bestow\noffspring on me, O fathers, a boy crowned with lotuses; that there may he a\nman here!\' (Va _g_. S. II, 33.) [According to the comment, the other two cakes\nare thrown into the water or fire; or eaten by a priest.] For other\nvariations, see Donner, Pi _n_ _d_ apit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a. The Ka _n_ va\nrecension, on the whole, agrees with our text.\n\n[369:1](sbe1253.htm#fr_824) The Ka _n_ va text has as follows: \'Therefore he\nsays, Give us houses, O fathers!\' He then smells at the pot (ukha): that is\nthe sacrificer\'s share. They again put down the cakes together (with the rice\nin the pot! samavadadhati). The once-severed (stalks of grass) they put on the\nfire. The firebrand he again shifts to (the fire; apy-ar _g_ ati).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 3. Third Brahma _n_ a](sbe1254.htm)\n\n'
