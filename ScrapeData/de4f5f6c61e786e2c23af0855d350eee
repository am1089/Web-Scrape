Speech\noperates with words and sentences. Now a word (pada) originates from the\ncombination of a radical element and a suffix, and as these two elements have\ndifferent meanings it necessarily follows that the word itself can convey only\na sense affected with difference. And further, the plurality of words is based\non plurality of meanings; the sentence therefore which is an aggregate of\nwords expresses some special combination of things (meanings of words), and\nhence has no power to\n\np. 41\n\ndenote a thing devoid of all difference.--The conclusion is that sound cannot\nbe a means of knowledge for a thing devoid of all difference.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pratyaksha--even of the nirvikalpaka kind--proves\ndifference](sbe48011.htm)\n\n'
