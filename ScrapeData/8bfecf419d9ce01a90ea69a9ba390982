Wilkins, [1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n##### 3\\. THE VAR\xc4\x80HA OR BOAR AVAT\xc4\x80RA.\n\nThere is the same conflicting account of this as of the two preceding\nincarnations; the older books, and some of the more modern ones, describing it\nas an Avat\xc4\x81ra of Brahm\xc4\x81; and some of the modern books and popular belief\nregarding it as the work of Vishnu. There is, however, this distinction, that\nin the former, the transformation of the deity into a boar has apparently a\npurely cosmical character," the earth being immersed in the ocean. Brahm\xc4\x81, the\nCreator, in the shape of a boar, raised it on his tusk; "whereas, in the\nlatter, it altogether represents the extrication of the world from a deluge of\niniquity by the rites of religion." *\n\nThe first mention of this incarnation is in the "Taittiriya Sanhit\xc4\x81," \xe2\x80\xa0 and is\nas follows: "The universe was formerly water, fluid. On it Praj\xc4\x81pati (Brahm\xc4\x81)\nbecoming wind, moved. Becoming a boar, he took it up." In harmony with this is\na verse in the "Taittiriya Br\xc4\x81hmana":--"This universe was formerly water,\nfluid. With that (water) Praj\xc4\x81pati practised arduous devotions\n\np. 145\n\n[paragraph continues] (saying), \'How shall this universe be (developed)?\' He\nbeheld a lotus leaf standing. He thought, \'There is something on which this\nrests.\' He as a boar--having assumed that form--plunged beneath towards it. He\nfound the earth down below. Breaking off (a portion of) her, he rose to the\nsurface." In the "Satapatha Br\xc4\x81hmana" * there is a similar reference, but\nthere the boar is called "Emusha." Formerly the earth was only of the size of\na span. A boar called Emusha raised her up.\n\nDr. Muir \xe2\x80\xa0 gives two accounts of this incarnation from two recensions of the\nR\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana. In one, which he considers the older, it is said that Brahm\xc4\x81 assumed\nthe form of a boar; in the other, Vishnu _in the form of Brahm \xc4\x81_ is said to\nhave accomplished this work. The alteration of the text is very noticeable.\n"All was water only, in which the earth was formed. Thence arose Brahm\xc4\x81, the\nself-existent, with the deities. He then becoming a boar, raised up the earth,\nand created the whole world with the saints his sons." So far the probably\nolder recension. In the later one we read, "All was water only, through which\nthe earth was formed. Thence arose Brahm\xc4\x81, the self-existent, the imperishable\nVishnu. He then, becoming a boar, raised up this earth and created the whole\nworld."\n\nIn the following account from the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa1 it will be noticed that,\nas in the last quotation from the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana, it was Vishnu in the form of\nBrahm\xc4\x81 who became a boar. As the earlier writers had declared this to have\nbeen Brahm\xc4\x81\'s work, it was necessary to identify Vishnu with him.\n\n"Tell me how at the commencement of the present age, N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana, who is named\nBrahm\xc4\x81, created all existing\n\np. 146\n\nthings. At the close of the last age, the divine Brahm\xc4\x81 endowed with the\nquality of goodness, awoke from his night of sleep, and beheld the universal\nvoid. He, the supreme N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana, . . . invested with the form of Brahm\xc4\x81, . . .\nconcluding that within the waters lay the earth, and being desirous to raise\nit up, created another form for that purpose. And as in the preceding ages he\nhad assumed the shape of a fish, or a tortoise, so in this he took the form of\na boar. Having adopted a form composed of the sacrifices of the Vedas for the\npreservation of the whole earth, the eternal, supreme, and universal soul\nplunged into the ocean." In a note on this passage in the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na," by\nProfessor Wilson, it is stated that, according to the "V\xc4\x81yu Pur\xc4\x81na," the form\nof a boar was chosen because it is an animal delighting in water; but in other\nPur\xc4\x81nas, as in the Vishnu, it is said to be a type of the ritual of the Vedas,\nfor which reason the elevation of the earth on the tusks of a boar is regarded\nas an allegorical representation of the extrication of the world from a deluge\nof sin, by the rites of religion.\n\nThe earth, bowing with devout adoration, addressed the boar, as he approached,\nin a hymn of great beauty, in which she reminds him that she sprang from him,\nand is dependent on him, as in fact are all things. Being thus praised, "the\nauspicious supporter of the world emitted a low murmuring sound, like the\nchanting of the Sama-Veda; and the mighty boar, whose eyes were like the\nlotus, whose body was vast as the Nila mountains, and of the dark colour of\nthe lotus leaves, uplifted upon his ample tusks the earth from its lowest\nregions. As he reared up his head, the waters that rushed from his brow\npurified the great sages, Sanandana and others residing in the sphere of the\nsaints. Through\n\np. 147\n\nthe indentations made by his hoofs, the waters rushed into the lower worlds\nwith a thundering noise. Before his breath, the pious denizens of Janaloka\n(abode of men) were scattered, and the Munis sought for shelter amongst the\nbristles upon the body of the boar, trembling as he rose up supporting the\nearth, and dripping with moisture. Then the great sages Sanandana and the\nrest, residing continually in the sphere of the saints, were inspired with\ndelight, and bowing lowly, they praised the stern-eyed upholder of the earth."\n\nBefore noticing the hymn of these saints, in which the boar is identified with\nthe various parts of worship, we can gather a little more information from the\nother Pur\xc4\x81nas respecting the dimensions, etc., of this animal. The V\xc4\x81yu says,\n"The boar was ten yojanas * in breadth, and a thousand yojanas in height; his\ncolour was like a dark cloud, and his roar like thunder. His bulk was vast as\na mountain; his tusks were white, sharp, and fearful; fire flashed from his\neyes like lightning, and he was radiant as the sun. His shoulders were round,\nfat, and large; he strode along like a powerful lion; his haunches were fat,\nhis loins slender, and his body smooth and beautiful." With this the Matsya\nagrees. The Bh\xc4\x81gavata describes the boar "as issuing from the nostrils of\nBrahm\xc4\x81; at first of the size of a thumb, and presently increasing to the size\nof an elephant." This Pur\xc4\x81na adds a legend of the slaying of Hirany\xc4\x81ksha, who,\nin a former birth, was a doorkeeper of Vishnu\'s palace. He having refused\nadmission to a number of Munis, so enraged them, that they cursed him; in\nconsequence of this he was re-born as a son of Diti. When the earth sunk in\nthe waters, Vishnu was seen by this\n\np. 148\n\ndemon in the act of raising it. Hirany\xc4\x81ksha claimed the earth, and defying\nVishnu, they fought, and the demon was slain.\n\nNow follow the hymns to the Var\xc4\x81ha as sung by the saints: "Triumph, lord of\nlords, supreme! Kesava, sovereign of the earth . . . cause of production,\ndestruction and existence. Thou art, O god! there is none other supreme\ncondition than thou. Thou, lord, art the person of the sacrifice; thy feet are\nthe Vedas; thy tusks are the stake to which the victim is bound; thy teeth are\nthe offerings; thy mouth is the altar; thy tongue is the fire; and the hairs\nof thy body are the sacrificial grass. Thy eyes, O omnipotent! are day and\nnight; thy head is the seat of all--the place of Brahm\xc4\x81; thy name is all the\nhymns of the Vedas; thy nostrils are all oblations. O thou, whose snout is the\nladle of oblation; whose deep voice is the chanting of the Sama-Veda; whose\nbody is the hall of sacrifice; whose joints are the different ceremonies; and\nwhose ears have the properties of both voluntary and obligatory rites; do\nthou, who art eternal, who art in size a mountain, be propitious . . . raise\nup this earth for the habitation of created beings!"\n\n"The supreme being thus eulogized, upholding the earth, raised it quickly, and\nplaced it on the summit of the ocean, where it floats like a mighty vessel,\nand, on account of its expansive surface, does not sink beneath the waters."\nThis seems rather to contradict the common notion of the Hindus, that the\nearth rests upon the back \xc5\x8df a tortoise; and that earthquakes are the result\nof the tortoise changing the foot on which he stands, when weary.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[144:*](hmvp21.htm#fr_147) Goldstucker, Chambers\'s Cyclopedia, _s.v._\n"Vishnu."\n\n[144:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp21.htm#fr_148) Muir, O.
