To what splendour do the Maruts all equally [1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:1:1)\ncling [2](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:1:2), they who are of the same age, and dwell\nin the same nest? With what thoughts?--from whence are they come\n[3](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:1:3)? Do these heroes sing forth their (own) strength\n[4](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:1:4), wishing for wealth?\n\n2\\. Whose prayers have the youths accepted? Who has turned the Maruts to his\nown sacrifice? By what strong desire [1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:2:1) may we\narrest them, they who float through the air like hawks?\n\nThe Dialogue.\n\nThe Maruts speak:\n\n3\\. From whence [1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:3:1), O Indra, dost thou come alone,\nthou who art mighty? O lord of men [2](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:3:2), what has\nthus happened to thee? Thou greetest (us) [3](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:3:3) when\nthou comest together with (us), the bright (Maruts)\n[4](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:3:4). Tell us then, thou with thy bay horses, what\nthou hast against us!\n\nIndra speaks:\n\n4\\. The sacred songs are mine, (mine are) the prayers\n[1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:4:1); sweet [2](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:4:2) are the\nlibations! My strength rises [3](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:4:3), my thunderbolt is\nhurled forth. They call for me, the hymns yearn for me. Here are my horses,\nthey carry me hither.\n\nThe Maruts speak:\n\n5\\. From thence, in company with our strong\n\np. 180\n\nfriends [1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:5:1), having adorned our bodies, we now\nharness our fallow deer [2](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:5:2) with all our might\n[3](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:5:3);--for, Indra, according to custom, thou hast\ncome to be with us.\n\nIndra speaks:\n\n6\\. Where, O Maruts, was that custom with you, when you left me alone in the\nkilling of Ahi? I indeed am terrible, powerful, strong,--I escaped from the\nblows of every enemy [1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:6:1).\n\nThe Maruts speak:\n\n7\\. Thou hast achieved much with us as companions\n[1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:7:1). With equal valour, O hero! let us achieve then\nmany things, O thou most powerful, O Indra! whatever we, O Maruts, wish with\nour mind [2](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:7:2).\n\nIndra speaks:\n\n8\\. I slew V _ri_ tra, O Maruts, with (Indra's) might, having grown powerful\nthrough my own vigour; I, who hold the thunderbolt in my arms, have made these\nall-brilliant waters to flow freely for man [1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:8:1).\n\nThe Maruts speak:\n\n9\\. Nothing, O mighty lord, is strong [1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:9:1) before\nthee: no one is known among the gods [2](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:9:2) like unto\nthee. No one who is now born [3](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:9:3) comes near, no one\nwho has been born. Do what thou wilt do [4](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:9:4), thou\nwho art grown so strong.\n\nIndra speaks:\n\n10\\. Almighty strength be mine alone, whatever I may do, daring in my heart\n[1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:10:1); for I indeed, O Maruts, am known as terrible:\nof all that I threw down, I, Indra, am the lord.\n\nIndra speaks:\n\n11\\. O Maruts, now your praise has pleased me, the glorious hymn which you\nhave made for me, ye\n\np. 181\n\nmen!--for me, for Indra, for the joyful hero, as friends for a friend, for\nyour own sake, and by your own efforts [1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:11:1).\n\nIndra speaks:\n\n12\\. Truly, there they are, shining towards me, bringing blameless glory,\nbringing food. O Maruts, wherever I have looked for you, you have appeared to\nme in bright splendour: appear to me also now!\n\nThe Epilogue.\n\nThe sacrificer speaks:\n\n13\\. Who has magnified you here, O Maruts? Come hither, O friends, towards\nyour friends. Ye brilliant Maruts, welcoming [1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:13:1)\nthese prayers, be mindful [2](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:13:2) of these my rites.\n\n14\\. The wisdom of Manya has brought us hither, that he should help as the\npoet helps the performer of a sacrifice [1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:14:1): turn\nhither quickly [2](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:14:2)! Maruts, on to the sage! the\nsinger has recited these prayers for you.\n\n15\\. May this your praise, O Maruts, this song of Mandarya, the son of Mana\n[1](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:15:1), the poet, bring offspring\n[2](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:15:2) for ourselves with food. May we have an\ninvigorating autumn, with quickening rain [3](sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:15:3).\n\np. 182\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nA critical examination of Professor von Roth's remarks on this hymn, together\nwith some supplementary notes of my own, will be found in the Preface to this\nvolume.\n\nAccording to the Anukrama _n_ ika this hymn is a dialogue between Agastya, the\nMaruts, and Indra. A careful consideration of the hymn would probably have led\nus to a similar conclusion, but I doubt whether it would have led us to adopt\nthe same distribution of the verses among the poet, the Maruts, and Indra, as\nthat adopted by the author of the Anukrama _n_ ika. He assigns the first two\nverses to Indra, the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth to the Maruts, the\nfourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth to Indra, and the three\nconcluding verses to Agastya. I think that the two verses in the beginning, as\nwell as the three concluding verses, belong certainly to Agastya or to whoever\nelse the real performer of the sacrifice may have been. The two verses in the\nbeginning cannot be ascribed to Indra, who, to judge from his language, would\nnever say: 'By what strong desire may we arrest the Maruts?' It might seem, in\nfact, as if the three following verses too should be ascribed to the\nsacrificer, so that the dialogue between Indra and the Maruts would begin only\nwith the sixth verse. The third verse might well be addressed to Indra by the\nsacrificer, and in the fourth verse we might see a description of all that he\nhad done for Indra. What is against this view, however, is the phrase prabh\n_ri_ ta _h_ me adri _h_. If used by the sacrificer, it might seem to mean, 'my\nstone, i. e. the stone used for squeezing the Soma, has been brought forth.'\nBut though Professor Roth assigns this meaning to prabh _ri_ ta in our\npassage, I doubt whether, in connection with adri, or with va _g_ ra, prabh\n_ri_ ta can mean anything but hurled. Thus we read:\n\nI, 61, 12. asmai it u _m_ (iti) pra bhara--v _ri_ tra\xc2\xb4ya va _g_ ram.\n\nHurl thou, Indra, the thunderbolt against this V _ri_ tra.\n\nV, 32, 7. yat im va _g_ rasya pra-bh _ri_ tau dada\xc2\xb4bha.\n\nWhen Indra conquered him in the hurling of the thunderbolt.\n\np. 183\n\nI therefore suppose the dialogue to begin with verse 3, and I find that\nLanglois, though it may be from different reasons, arrived at the same\nconclusion.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the other verses, to verse 12, are rightly\napportioned between Indra and the Maruts. Verse 12 might perhaps be attributed\nagain to the worshipper of the Maruts, but as there is no absolute necessity\nfor assigning it to him, it is better to follow the tradition and to take it\nas the last verse of Indra's speech. It would seem, in fact, as if these ten\nverses, from 3 to 12, formed an independent poem, which was intended to show\nthe divine power of the Maruts. That their divine power was sometimes denied,\nand that Indra's occasional contempt of them was well known to the Vedic\npoets, will become evident from other hymns. This dialogue seems therefore to\nhave been distinctly intended to show that, in spite of occasional\nmisunderstandings between the Maruts and the all-powerful Indra, Indra himself\nhad fully recognised their power and accepted their friendship. If we suppose\nthat this dialogue was repeated at sacrifices in honour of the Maruts, or that\npossibly it was acted by two parties, one representing Indra, the other the\nMaruts and their followers, then the two verses in the beginning and the three\nat the end ought to be placed in the mouth of the actual sacrificer, whoever\nhe was. He begins by asking, Who has attracted the Maruts to his sacrifice,\nand by what act of praise and worship can they be delighted? Then follows the\ndialogue in honour of the Maruts, and after it the sacrificer asks again, 'Who\nhas magnified the Maruts, i. e. have not we magnified them?' and he implores\nthem to grant him their friendship in recognition of his acts of worship. If\nthen we suppose that the dialogue was the work of Mandarya Manya, the\nfourteenth verse, too, would lose something of its obscurity. Coming from the\nmouth of the actual sacrificer, it would mean, 'the wisdom, or the poetical\npower, of Manya has brought us to this, has induced us to do this, i. e. to\nperform this dialogue of Manya, so that he, Manya, should assist, as a poet\nassists the priest at a sacrifice.' Of course all this is and can only be\nguess-work.\n\np. 184\n\n[paragraph continues] We do not know the age of Manya nor that of Agastya. We\ndo not know whether they were Contemporaries or not. But supposing that Manya\nwas present at the sacrifice, vipra might be meant for Manya; and in the last\nwords, too, 'the singer has recited these prayers for you,' the singer ( _g_\narita\xc2\xb4) might again be Manya, the powerful poet whose services the sacrificer\nhad engaged, and whose famous dialogue between Indra and the Maruts was\nconsidered a safe means of winning their favour. It would be in keeping with\nall this, if in the last verse the sacrificer once more informed the Maruts\nthat this hymn of praise was the work of the famous poet Mandarya, the son of\nMana, and if he then concluded with the usual prayer for safety, food, and\nprogeny.\n\nNo verse of this hymn occurs in the Sama-veda; verse 3 = VS. XXXIII, 27; verse\n4 = VS. XXXIII, 78; verse 6 = TB. II, 8, 3, 5; verse 8 = TB. 11, 8, 3, 6;\nverse 9 = VS. XXXIII, 79.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. As samani\xc2\xb4 occurs in the Veda as the feminine of samana (cf. IV, 51,\n9; X, 191, 3; 4), samanya\xc2\xb4 might, no doubt, be taken as an instrumental,\nbelonging to _s_ ubha\xc2\xb4. We should then have to translate: 'With what equal\nsplendour are the Maruts endowed?' Saya _n_ a adopts the same explanation,\nwhile Wilson, who seems to have read samanya _h_ , translates 'of one\ndignity.' Professor Roth, s. v. myaksh, would seem to take samanya\xc2\xb4 as some\nkind of substantive, and he refers to another passage, I, 167, 4, sadhara _n_\nya\xc2\xb4-iva maruta _h_ mimikshu _h_ , without, however, detailing his\ninterpretation of these passages.\n\nIt cannot be said that Saya _n_ a's explanation is objectionable, yet there is\nsomething awkward in qualifying by an adjective, however indefinite, what\nforms the subject of an interrogative sentence, and it would be possible to\navoid this, by taking samanya\xc2\xb4 as an adverb. It is clearly used as an adverb\nin III, 54, 7; VIII, 83, 8.\n\nNote 2. Mimikshu _h_ is the perfect of myaksh, in the sense of to be firmly\njoined with something. It has therefore a more definite meaning than the Latin\nmiscere and the Greek \xce\xbc\xce\xaf\xcf\x83\xce\xb3\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xce\xbd, which come from the same source, i. e.\n\np. 185\n\nfrom a root mik or mig, in Sanskrit also mi _s_ in mi _s_ -ra; (see Curtius,\nGrundzuge, p. 300.) There may be indeed one or two passages in the Veda where\nmyaksh seems to have the simple meaning of mixing, but it will be seen that\nthey constitute a small minority compared with those where myaksh has the\nmeaning of holding to, sticking to; I mean\n\nX, 104, 2. mimikshu _h_ yam adraya _h_ indra tubhyam.\n\nThe Soma which the stones have mixed for thee.\n\nThis form cannot be derived from mimiksh, but is the 3rd pers. plur. perf.\nParasm. of myaksh. It may, however, be translated, 'This Soma which the stones\nhave grasped or squeezed for thee,' as may be seen from passages quoted\nhereafter, in which myaksh is construed with an accusative.\n\nII, 3, 11. gh _ri_ tam mimikshe.\n\nThe butter has been mixed.\n\nThis form cannot be derived from mimiksh, but is the 3rd pers. sing. perf.\n\xc3\x82tm. of myaksh. If the meaning of mixing should be considered inadmissible, we\nmight in this verse also translate, 'The butter has become fixed, solid, or\ncoagulated.'\n\nLeaving out of consideration for the present the forms which are derived from\nmimiksh, we find the following passages in which myaksh occurs. Its original\nmeaning must have been to be mixed with, to be joined to, and in many passages\nthat original sense is still to be recognised, only with the additional idea\nof being firmly joined, of sticking to, or, in an active sense, laying hold\nof, grasping firmly.\n\n1\\. Without any case:\n\nI, 169, 3. amyak sa\xc2\xb4 te indra _ri_ sh _t_ i _h_ asme (iti).\n\nThis thy spear, O Indra, sat firm for us.\n\nThis would mean that Indra held his weapon well, as a soldier ought to hold\nhis spear. \xc3\x81myak is the 3rd pers. sing. of a second aor. Parasm., amyaksham,\namyak(sh + t); (Say. prapnoti.) Cf. VIII, 61, 18.\n\n2\\. With locative:\n\nX, 44, 2. mimyaksha va _g_ ra _h_ n _ri_ -pate gabhastau.\n\nIn thy fist, O king, the thunderbolt rests firmly.\n\np. 186\n\nI, 167, 3. mimyaksha yeshu su-dhita-- _ri_ sh _t_ i _h_.\n\nTo whom clings the well-grasped spear.\n\nVI, 50, 5. mimyaksha yeshu rodasi\xc2\xb4 nu devi\xc2\xb4.\n\nTo whom the goddess Rodasi clings. (Say. sa _m_ ga _k_ _kh_ ate.)\n\nVI, 11, 5. amyakshi sadma sadane p _ri_ thivya\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nThe seat was firmly set on the seat of the earth. (Say. gamyate, parig _ri_\nhyate.) It is the 3rd pers. sing. aor. pass.\n\nVI, 29, 2. a\xc2\xb4 yasmin haste narya _h_ mimikshu _h_ a\xc2\xb4 rathe hira _n_ yaye\nrathe-stha\xc2\xb4 _h_ , a\xc2\xb4 ra _s_ maya _h_ gabhastyo _h_ sthurayo _h_ a\xc2\xb4 adhvan a\n_s_ vasa _h_ v _r i_sha _n_ a _h_ yu _g_ ana\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nTo whose hand men cling, in whose golden chariot the drivers stand firm, in\nwhose strong fists the reins are well held, on whose path the harnessed\nstallions hold together. (Say. asi _k_ yante, apuryante; or asi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ anti,\npurayanti.)\n\nX, 96, 3. indre ni rupa\xc2\xb4 harita mimikshire.\n\nBright colours stuck or clung or settled on Indra. (Say. nishiktani babhuvu\n_h_ ; mihe _h_ sanantat karma _n_ i rupam.)\n\n3\\. With instrumental:\n\nI, 165, 1. kaya _s_ ubha\xc2\xb4 maruta _h_ sam mimikshu _h_.\n\nTo what splendour do the Maruts cling; or, what splendour clings to them?\n\nV, 58, 5. svaya matya\xc2\xb4 maruta _h_ sam mimikshu _h_. (See also I, 165, 1.)\n\nThe Maruts cling to their own thought or will. (Say. v _ri_ sh _t_ ya samyak\nsi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ anti.)\n\nI, 167, 4. yavya\xc2\xb4 sadhara _n_ ya\xc2\xb4-iva maruta _h_ mimikshu _h_.\n\nThe Maruts cling to the young maid, as if she belonged to all. See I, 173, 12;\nVIII, 98, 8; or VI, 27, 6,\n\nI, 87, 6. bhanu-bhi _h_ sam mimikshire.\n\nThe Maruts were joined with splendour. (Say. me _dh_ um i _k_ _kh_ anti.)\n\n4\\. With accusative:\n\nVIII, 61, 18. ni ya\xc2\xb4 va _g_ ram mimikshatu _h_.\n\nThy two arms which have firmly grasped the thunderbolt. (Say. parig _ri_ h _n_\nita _h_.)\n\nHere I should also prefer to place VII, 20, 4, if we might read mimikshe or\nmimyaksha, for it is impossible to take mimikshan for anything but a\nparticiple of the desiderative of mih, which does not yield an appropriate\nmeaning.\n\np. 187\n\nni va _g_ ram indra _h_ mimikshan.\n\nGrasping firmly the thunderbolt. (Say. _s_ atrushu prapayan.)\n\nVI, 29, 3. _s_ riye te pa\xc2\xb4da duva _h_ a\xc2\xb4 mimikshu _h_.\n\nThy servants embrace thy feet for their happiness. (Say. asi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ anti,\nsamarpayanti.)\n\nLike other verbs which mean to join, myaksh, if accompanied by prepositions\nexpressive of separation, means to separate. (Cf. vi-yukta, se-junctus.)\n\nII, 28, 6. apo (iti) su myaksha varu _n_ a bhiyasam mat.\n\nRemove well from me, O Varu _n_ a, terror. (Say. apagamaya.)\n\nQuite distinct from this is the desiderative or inchoative verb mimiksh, from\nmih, in the sense of to sprinkle, or to shower, chiefly used with reference to\nthe gods who are asked to sprinkle the sacrifice with rain. Thus we read:\n\nI, 142, 3. madhva ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am mimikshati.\n\n(Narasa _m_ sa) sprinkles the sacrifice with rain.\n\nIX, 107, 6. madhva ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am mimiksha na _h_.\n\nSprinkle (O Soma) our sacrifice with rain.\n\nI, 34, 3. tri _h_ adya ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am madhuna mimikshatam.\n\nO A _s_ vins, sprinkle the sacrifice with rain thrice to-day!\n\nI, 47, 4. madhva ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am mimikshatam.\n\nO A _s_ vins, sprinkle the sacrifice with rain!\n\n5\\. Without madhu:\n\nI, 22, 13. mahi\xc2\xb4 dyau _h_ p _ri_ thivi\xc2\xb4 _k_ a na _h_ imam ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am\nmimikshatam.\n\nMay the great heaven and earth sprinkle this our sacrifice.\n\n6\\. With madhu in the accusative:\n\nVI, 70, 5. madhu na _h_ dya\xc2\xb4vap _ri_ thivi\xc2\xb4 (iti) mimikshatam.\n\nMay heaven and earth shower down rain for us.\n\nVery frequently the A _s_ vins are asked to sprinkle the sacrifice with their\nwhip. This whip seems originally, like the whip of the Maruts, to have been\nintended for the cracking noise of the storm, preceding the rain. Then as\nwhips had possibly some similarity to the instruments used for sprinkling\nbutter on the sacrificial viands, the A _s_ vins are\n\np. 188\n\nasked to sprinkle the sacrifice with their whip, i. e. to give rain:\n\nI, 157, 4. madhu-matya na _h_ ka _s_ aya mimikshatam.\n\nO A _s_ vins, sprinkle us with your rain-giving whip.\n\nI, 22, 3. taya ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am mimikshatam.\n\nO A _s_ vins, sprinkle the sacrifice with it (your whip).\n\n7\\. Lastly, we find such phrases as,\n\nI, 48, 16. sam na _h_ raya\xc2\xb4--mimikshva.\n\nSprinkle us with wealth, i. e. shower wealth down upon us. Here mih is really\ntreated as a Hu-verb in the \xc3\x82tmanepada, though others take it for mimikshasva.\n\nAs an adjective, mimikshu is applied to Indra (III, 50, 3), and mimiksha to\nSoma (VI, 34, 4).\n\nNote 3. I do not see how etasa _h_ can here be taken in any sense but that\nsuggested by the Pada, a\xc2\xb4-itasa _h_ , come near. Professor Roth thinks it not\nimpossible that it may be meant for eta _h_ , the fallow deer, the usual team\nof the Maruts. These Etas are mentioned in verse 5, but there the Pada gives\nquite correctly etan, not a\xc2\xb4-itan, and Saya _n_ a explains it accordingly by\ngantun.\n\nNote 4. The idea that the Maruts proclaim their own strength occurred before,\nI, 87, 3. It is a perfectly natural conception, for the louder the voice of\nthe wind, the greater its strength, and vice versa.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Manas here, as elsewhere, is used in the sense of thought preceding\nspeech, desire, or devotion not yet expressed in prayer. See Taitt. Sa _m_ h.\nV, 1, 3, 3. yat purusho manasabhiga _k_ _kh_ ati tad va _k_ a vadati, what a\nman grasps in his mind, that he expresses by speech. Professor Roth suggests\nan emendation which is ingenious, but not necessary, viz. maha\xc2\xb4 namasa, with\ngreat adoration, an expression which occurs, if not in VI, 52, 17, at least in\nVII, 12, 1. We find, however, the phrase maha\xc2\xb4 manasa in\n\nVI, 40, 4.\n\na\xc2\xb4 yahi _s_ asvat u _s_ ata\xc2\xb4 yayatha indra maha\xc2\xb4 manasa soma-peyam,  \nupa brahma _n_ i _s_ _ri_ _n_ ava _h_ ima\xc2\xb4 na _h_ atha te ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_\ntanve\xcc\x83 vaya _h_ dhat.\n\np. 189\n\nCome hither, thou hast always come, Indra, to our libation through our\nyearning great desire. Mayest thou hear these our prayers, and may then the\nsacrifice put vigour in thy body.\n\nIt is curious to observe that throughout the Rig-veda the instrumental\nsingular maha\xc2\xb4 is always used as an adjective belonging to some term or other\nfor praise and prayer. Besides the passages mentioned, we find:\n\nII, 24, 1. aya\xc2\xb4 vidhema navaya maha\xc2\xb4 gira\xc2\xb4.\n\nLet us sacrifice with this new great song.\n\nVI, 52, 17. su-uktena maha\xc2\xb4 namasa a\xc2\xb4 vivase.\n\nI worship with a hymn with great adoration, or I worship with a great hymn in\nadoration. VIII, 46, 14. gaya gira\xc2\xb4 maha\xc2\xb4 vi- _k_ etasam. Celebrate the wise\nIndra with a great song. Otherwise we might translate, Thou hast always come\nwith a great yearning desire.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. We ought to scan ku\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 _h_ t\xcc\x86va\xcc\x86m i\xcc\x84nd\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x86 ma\xcc\x84hi\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84 _h_ san, because\nyasi, being anudatta, could not begin a new pada. It would be more natural to\ntranslate kuta _h_ by why? for the Maruts evidently wish to express their\nsurprise at Indra's going to do battle alone and without their assistance. I\ndo not think, however, that in the Rig-veda, even in the latest hymns, kuta\n_h_ has as yet a causal meaning, and I have therefore translated it in the\nsame sense in which it occurs before in the poet's address to the Maruts.\n\nNote 2. Sat-pati, lord of men, means lord of real men, of heroes, and should\nnot be translated by good lord. Sat by itself is frequently used in the sense\nof heroes, of men physically rather than morally good:\n\nII, I, 3. tvam agne indra _h_ v _ri_ shabha _h_ sata\xc2\xb4m asi.\n\nThou, Agni, art Indra, the hero among heroes.\n\nI, 173, 7. samat-su tva _s_ ura sata\xc2\xb4m ura _n_ am.\n\nThee, O hero, in battles the protector of (good and true) men.\n\nNote 3. The meaning of sam p _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ase is very much the same as that\nof sam vadasva in I, 170, 5.\n\nNote 4. _S_ ubhana is evidently meant as a name for the\n\np. 190\n\n[paragraph continues] Maruts, who thus speak of themselves in the third\nperson, which is by no means unusual in the Rig-veda.\n\nMahidhara explains _s_ ubhanai _h_ by _s_ obhanair va _k_ anai _h_.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nIndra certainly addresses his old friends, the Maruts, very unceremoniously,\nbut this, though at first startling, was evidently the intention of the poet.\nHe wished to represent a squabble between Indra and the Maruts, such as they\nwere familiar with in their own village life, and this was to be followed by a\nreconciliation. The boorish rudeness, selfishness, and boastfulness here\nascribed to Indra may seem offensive to those who cannot divest themselves of\nthe modern meaning of deities, but looked upon from the right point of view,\nit is really full of interest.\n\nNote 1. Brahma _n_ i and mataya _h_ are here mentioned separately in the same\nway as a distinction is made between brahman, stoma, and uktha, IV, 22, I; VI,\n23, 1; between brahma _n_ i and gira _h_ , III, 51, 6; between brahma, gira\n_h_ , and stoma _h_ , VI, 38, 3; between brahma, gira _h_ , uktha\xc2\xb4, and manma,\nVI, 38, 4, &c.\n\nNote 2. _S_ am, which I have here translated by sweet, is a difficult word to\nrender. It is used as a substantive, as an adjective, and as an adverb; and in\nseveral instances it must remain doubtful whether it was meant for one or the\nother. The adverbial character is almost always, if not always, applicable,\nthough in English there is no adverb of such general import as _s_ am, and we\nmust therefore render it differently, although we are able to perceive that in\nthe mind of the poet it might still have been conceived as an adverb, in the\nsense of 'well.' I shall arrange the principal passages in which _s_ am occurs\naccording to the verbs with which it is construed.\n\n1\\. With bhu:\n\nVIII, 79, 7. bhava na _h_ soma _s_ am h _ri_ de.\n\nBe thou, Soma, well (pleasant) to our heart. Cf. VIII,\n\n82, 3.\n\nVIII, 48, 4. _s_ am na _h_ bhava h _ri_ de a\xc2\xb4 pita _h_ indo (iti).\n\np. 191\n\nBe thou well (sweet) to our heart, when drunk, O Soma! Cf. X, 9, 4.\n\nI, 90, 9. _s_ am na _h_ bhavatu aryama\xc2\xb4.\n\nMay Aryaman be well (kind) to us!\n\nVI, 74, 1. _s_ am na _h_ bhutam dvi-pade _s_ am _k_ atu _h_ -pade.\n\nMay Soma and Rudra be well (kind) to our men and cattle.\n\nHere _s_ am might be rendered as an adverb, or as an adjective, or even as a\nsubstantive, in the sense of health or blessing.\n\nCf. VII, 54, I; IX, 69, 7. The expression dvipad and _k_ atu _h_ -pad is\ncuriously like what occurs in the prayers of the Eugubian tables, Fisovie San\n_s_ ie, ditu ocre Fisi, tote Jovine, ocrer Fisie, totar Jovinar dupursus,\npeturpursus fato fito (Umbrische Sprachdenkmaler, ed. Aufrecht, p. 198); and\nalso in the edicts of Piyadasi, dupada- _k_ atupadesu pakhivali _k_ alesu,\n'aux bipedes, aux quadrupedes, aux volatiles, aux animaux qui se meuvent dans\nles eaux.' See Burnouf, Lotus, p. 667.\n\nII, 38, 11. _s_ am yat stot _r i_-bhya _h_ apaye bhavati.\n\nWhat may be well (a pleasure) for the praisers, for the friend.\n\nX, 37, 10. _s_ am na _h_ bhava _k_ akshasa.\n\nBe kind to us with thy light!\n\n2\\.

With as or bhu understood:\n\nVI, 45, 22. _s_ am yat gave na _s_ akine.\n\nA song which is pleasant to the mighty Indra, as food to an ox.\n\nVIII, 13, 11. _s_ am it hi te.\n\nFor it is well for thee.\n\nX, 86, 15. mantha _h_ te indra _s_ am h _ri_ de.\n\nThe mixture is pleasant to thy heart, O Indra!\n\nX, 97, 18. aram ka\xc2\xb4maya, _s_ am h _ri_ de.\n\nEnough for love, pleasant to the heart.\n\nVI, 34, 3. _s_ am tat asmai.\n\nThat is pleasant to him.\n\nVI, 21, 4. ka _h_ te ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_ manase _s_ am varaya.\n\nWhat sacrifice seems to thy mind pleasant to select?\n\n4\\. With kar:\n\nI, 43, 6. _s_ am na _h_ karati arvate.\n\nMay he do well to our horse, i. e. may he benefit our horses.\n\nIV, I, 3. toka\xc2\xb4ya tu _g_ e-- _s_ am k _ri_ dhi.\n\nDo good to our children and progeny, or bless us for the procreation of\nchildren.\n\nVIII, 18, 8. _s_ am na _h_ karata _h_ a _s_ vina.\n\nMay the two A _s_ vins do us good!\n\n5\\. With vah:\n\nI, 157, 3. sam na _h_ a\xc2\xb4 vakshat dvi-pade _k_ atu _h_ -pade.\n\nMay he bring blessing to us for man and cattle.\n\nVIII, 5, 20. tena na _h_ --pa _s_ ve toka\xc2\xb4ya sam gave, vahatam pi\xc2\xb4vari _h_\nisha _h_.\n\nBring to us rich food, a blessing to cattle, to children, and to the ox.\n\n6\\. With verbs, such as pu, va, and others, where it is clearly used as an\nadverb:\n\nIX, II, 3. sa _h_ na _h_ pavasva _s_ am gave _s_ am _g_ anaya sam arvate, _s_\nam ra _g_ an oshadhibhya _h_.\n\nDo thou, king Soma, stream upon us, a blessing for the ox, a blessing for man,\na blessing for the horse, a blessing for the plants. Cf. IX, 11, 7; 60, 4; 61,\n15; 109, 5.\n\nVII, 35, 4. _s_ am na _h_ ishira _h_ abhi vatu va\xc2\xb4ta _h_.\n\np. 193\n\nMay the brisk wind blow kindly upon us, or blow a blessing upon us!\n\nVII, 35, 6. _s_ am na _h_ tvash _t_ a gna\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ iha _s_ _ri_ _n_ otu.\n\nMay Tvash _t_ ar with the goddesses hear us here well, i. e. auspiciously!\n\nVII, 35, 8. _s_ am na _h_ su\xc2\xb4rya _h_ --ut etu.\n\nMay the sun rise auspiciously for us!\n\nVIII, 18, 9. _s_ am na _h_ tapatu surya _h_.\n\nMay the sun warm us well!\n\nIII, 13, 6. _s_ am na _h_ _s_ o _k_ a--agne.\n\nShine well for us, O Agni!\n\n_S_ am Yo _h_.\n\n_S_ am also occurs in a phrase that has puzzled the interpreters of the Veda\nvery much, viz. _s_ am yo _h_. These are two words, and must both be taken as\nsubstantives, though originally they may have been adverbs. Their meaning\nseems to have been much the same, and in English they may safely be rendered\nby health and wealth, in the old acceptation of these words:\n\nI, 93, 7. dhattam ya _g_ amanaya _s_ am yo _h_.\n\nGive, Agni and Soma, to the sacrificer health and wealth.\n\nI, 106, 5. _s_ am yo _h_ yat te manu _h_ -hitam tat imahe.\n\nB _ri_ haspati, we ask for health and wealth which thou gavest to Manu.\n\nI, 114, 2. yat sam _k_ a yo _h_ _k_ a manu _h_ a-ye _g_ e pita\xc2\xb4 tat a _s_ yama\ntava rudra pra-nitishu.\n\nRudra, the health and wealth which Manu, the father, obtained, may we reach it\nunder thy guidance.\n\nII, 33, 13. ya\xc2\xb4ni manu _h_ av _ri_ _n_ ita pita\xc2\xb4 na _h_ ta\xc2\xb4 _s_ am ka yo _h_\nka rudrasya va _s_ mi.\n\nThe medicines which our father Manu chose, those I desire, the health and\nwealth of Rudra.\n\nI, 189, 2. bhava toka\xc2\xb4ya tanayaya _s_ am yo _h_.\n\nBe to our offspring health and wealth!\n\nIV, 12, 5. ya _k_ _kh_ a toka\xc2\xb4ya tanayaya _s_ am yo _h_.\n\nGive to our offspring health and wealth!\n\nV, 69, 3. i\xc2\xb4 _l_ e tokaya tanayaya _s_ am yo _h_.\n\nI ask for our offspring health and wealth,\n\np. 194\n\nVI, 50, 7. dha\xc2\xb4ta toka\xc2\xb4ya tanayaya sam yo _h_.\n\nGive to our offspring health and wealth!\n\nX, 182, I. atha karat ya _g_ amanaya _s_ am yo _h_.\n\nMay he then produce for the sacrificer health and wealth.\n\nVII, 69, 5. tena na _h_ _s_ am yo _h_ --ni a _s_ vina vahatam.\n\nOn that chariot bring to us, A _s_ vins, health and wealth.\n\nIII, 17, 3. atha bhava ya _g_ amanaya _s_ am yo _h_.\n\nThen, Agni, be health and wealth to the sacrificer.\n\nIII, 18, 4. b _ri_ hat vaya _h_ _s_ a _s_ amaneshu dhehi, revat agne\nvisva\xc2\xb4mitreshu _s_ am yo _h_.\n\nGive, Agni, much food to those who praise thee, give to the Vi _s_ vamitras\nrichly health and wealth.\n\nX, 15, 4. atha na _h_ sam yo _h_ arapa _h_ dadhata.\n\nAnd give us health and wealth without a flaw! Cf. X, 59, 8.\n\nX, 37, 11. tat asme _s_ am yo _h_ arapa _h_ dadhatana.\n\nAnd give to us health and wealth without a flaw!\n\nV, 47, 7. tat astu mitra-varu _n_ a tat agne _s_ am yo _h_ asmabhyam idam astu\n_s_ astam.\n\nLet this, O Mitra-Varu _n_ a, let this, O Agni, be health and wealth to us;\nmay this be auspicious!\n\nV, 53, 14. v _ri_ sh _t_ vi\xc2\xb4 _s_ am yo _h_ a\xc2\xb4pa _h_ usri bhesha _g_ am sya\xc2\xb4ma\nmaruta _h_ saha.\n\nLet us be together with you, O Maruts, after health, wealth, water, and\nmedicine have been showered down in the morning.\n\nVIII, 39, 4. _s_ am _k_ a yo _h_ ka maya _h_ dadhe.\n\nHe gave health, wealth, and happiness.\n\nVIII, 71, 15. agnim _s_ am yo _h_ _k_ a da\xc2\xb4tave.\n\nWe ask Agni to give us health and wealth.\n\nX, 9, 4. _s_ am yo _h_ abhi sravantu na _h_.\n\nMay the waters come to us, as health and wealth, or may they run towards us\nauspiciously.\n\nNote 3. If we retain the reading of the MSS. _s_ ushma _h_ iyarti, we must\ntake it as an independent phrase, and translate it by 'my strength rises.' For\n_s_ ushma, though in this and other places it is frequently explained as an\nadjective, meaning powerful, is, as far as I can see, always a substantive,\nand means breath, strength. There may be a few passages in which, as there\noccur several words for strength, it might\n\np. 195\n\nbe possible to translate _s_ ushma by strong. But even there it is better to\nkeep to the general meaning of sushma, and translate it as a substantive.\n\nIyarti means to rise and to raise. It is particularly applied to prayers\nraised by the poet in honour of the gods, and the similes used in connection\nwith this, show clearly what the action implied by iyarti really is. For\ninstance,\n\nI, 116, 1. stoman iyarmi abhriya-iva va\xc2\xb4ta _h_.\n\nI stir up hymns as the wind stirs the clouds.\n\nX, 116, 9. su-va _k_ asya\xc2\xb4m iyarmi sindhau-iva pra irayam na\xc2\xb4vam arkai _h_.\n\nI stir up sweet praise, as if I rowed a ship on the river with hymns.\n\nIn the sense of rising it occurs,\n\nX, 140, 2. pavaka-var _k_ a _h_ _s_ ukra-var _k_ a _h_ anuna-var _k_ a _h_ ut\niyarshi bhanuna.\n\nThou risest up with splendour, Agni, thou of bright, resplendent, undiminished\nmajesty.\n\nWe might therefore safely translate in our verse 'my strength rises,' although\nit is true that such a phrase does not occur again, and that in other passages\nwhere iyarti and sushma occur together, the former governs the latter in the\naccusative. Cf. IV, 17, 12; X, 75, 3.\n\nMahidhara translates, my held-up thunderbolt moves on destroying everything,'\nbut he admits another rendering in which adri would mean the stone used for\npressing the Soma.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. If, as we can hardly avoid, we ascribe this verse to. the Maruts, we\nmust recognise in it the usual offer of help to Indra on the part of the\nMaruts. The question then only is, who are the strong friends in whose company\nthey appear? It would be well if one could render antamebhi _h_ by horses, as\nSaya _n_ a does, but there is no authority for it. Sva-kshatra is an\nadjective, meaning endowed with independent strength, synonymous with sva-\ntavas, I, 166, 2. It is applied to the mind of Indra, I, 54, 3; V, 3, 4; to\nthe Maruts, V, 48, 1, but never to horses. As it stands, we can only suppose\nthat a distinction is made between the Maruts and their followers,\n\np. 196\n\nand that after calling together their followers, and adorning themselves for\nbattle, they proceed to harness their chariots. Cf. I, 107, 2.\n\nNote 2. Etan, in all MSS. which I consulted, has here the accent on the first\nsyllable, and Professor Aufrecht ought not to have altered the word into\neta\xc2\xb4n. If the accent had not been preserved by the tradition of the schools,\nthe later interpreters would certainly have taken etan for the demonstrative\npronoun. As it is, in spite of accent and termination, Saya _n_ a in I, 166,\n10, seems to take eta _h_ for ete. In other passages, however, Saya _n_ a,\ntoo, has perceived the difference, and in I, 169, 6, he explains the word very\nfully as p _ri_ shadvar _n_ a gantaro va a _s_ va va. In this passage the Etas\nare clearly the deer of the Maruts, the P _ri_ shatis:\n\nI, 169, 6. adha yat esham p _ri_ thu-budhna\xc2\xb4sa _h_ eta _h_.\n\nIn the next verse, however, eta seems applied to the Maruts themselves:\n\nI, 169, 7. prati ghora\xc2\xb4 _n_ am etanam aya\xc2\xb4sam marutam _s_ _ri_ _n_ ve a-yata\xc2\xb4m\nupabdi _h_.\n\nThe sound of the terrible, speckled, indefatigable Maruts is heard, as they\napproach; unless we translate:\n\nThe noise of the terrible deer of the indefatigable Maruts is heard, as they\napproach.\n\nIn I, 166, 10, amseshu eta _h_ , I adopt Professor Roth's conjecture, that eta\n_h_ means the skins of the fallow deer, so that we should have to translate:\nOn their shoulders are the deer-skins.\n\nIn the other passages where eta occurs it is used as a simile only, and\ntherefore throws no light on the relation of the Etas to the Maruts. In both\npassages, however (V, 54, 5; X, 77, 2), the simile refers to the Maruts,\nthough to their speed only, and not to their colour.\n\nNote 3. Maha _h_ -bhi _h_ , which I have translated 'with all our might,'\nseems to be used almost as an adverb, mightily or quickly (makshu), although\nthe original meaning, with our powers, through our might, is likewise\napplicable. The original meaning is quite perceptible in passages like\n\nV, 62, 3. adharayatam p _ri_ thivi\xc2\xb4m uta dya\xc2\xb4m mitra-ra _g_ ana varu _n_ a\nmaha _h_ -bhi _h_.\n\np. 197\n\nKings Mitra and Varu _n_ a, you have supported heaven and earth by your\npowers.\n\nVII, 3, 7. tebhi _h_ na _h_ agne amitai _h_ maha _h_ -bhi _h_ _s_ atam purbhi\n_h_ a\xc2\xb4yasibhi _h_ vi pahi.\n\nWith those immeasurable powers, O Agni, protect us, with a hundred iron\nstrongholds.\n\nI, 90, 2. te--maha _h_ -bhi _h_ , vrata\xc2\xb4 rakshante vi _s_ va\xc2\xb4ha.\n\nThey always protect the laws by their powers.\n\nVII, 71, 1. tvam na _h_ agne maha _h_ -bhi _h_ pahi.\n\nProtect us, Agni, with thy power.\n\nIn other passages, however, we see maha _h_ -bhi _h_ used of the light or of\nthe flames of Agni and of the dawn:\n\nIV, 14, 1. deva _h_ ro _k_ amana _h_ maha _h_ -bhi _h_.\n\nAgni, the god, brilliant with his powers.\n\nVI, 64, 2. devi ro _k_ amana maha _h_ -bhi _h_.\n\nO goddess, brilliant with thy powers.\n\nThe powers of the Maruts are referred to by the same name in the following\npassages:\n\nV, 58, 5. pra-pra _g_ ayante--maha _h_ -bhi _h_.\n\nThe Maruts are born with their powers.\n\nVII, 58, 2. pra ye maha _h_ -bhi _h_ o _g_ asa uta santi.\n\nThe Maruts who excel in power and strength. Cf. III, 4, 6.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Indra in this dialogue is evidently represented as claiming everything\nfor himself alone. He affects contempt for the help proffered by the Maruts,\nand seems to deny that he was at any time beholden to their assistance. By\nasking, Where was that custom that I should be with you and you with me in\nbattle? he implies that it was not always their custom, and that he can\ndispense with their succour now. He wants to be alone, as in his former battle\nwith Ahi, and does not wish that they should join him (cf. I, 33, 4).\nProfessor Roth takes sam-adhatta in the sense of implicating, but it can\nhardly be said that the Maruts ever implicated Indra in his fight against Ahi.\nCertainly this is not in keeping with the general tenor of this dialogue\nwhere, on the contrary, Indra shuns the\n\np. 198\n\ncompany of the Maruts. But while on this point I differ from Professor Roth, I\nthink he has rightly interpreted the meaning of anamam. Out of the four\npassages in which badhasnai _h_ occurs, it is three times joined with nam, and\nevery time has the sense of to bend away from, to escape from. See also Sonne,\nin Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xii, p. 348.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. See VII, 39, 6. sakshimahi yu _g_ yebhi _h_ nu devai _h_.\n\nNote 2. The last words leave no doubt as to their meaning, for the phrase is\none of frequent occurrence. The only difficulty is the vocative maruta _h_ ,\nwhere we should expect the nominative. It is quite possible, however, that the\nMaruts should here address themselves, though, no doubt, it would be easy to\nalter the accent. As to the phrase itself, see\n\nVIII, 61, 4. tatha it asat indra kratva yatha va _s_ a _h_.\n\nMay it be so, O Indra, as thou mayest desire by thy mind.\n\nVIII, 66, 4. va _g_ _r i\xc2\xb4_--it karat indra _h_ kratva yatha va _s_ at.\n\nMay Indra with the thunderbolt act as he may desire in his mind. Cf. VIII, 20,\n17; 28, 4, &c.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Here again Indra claims everything for himself, denying that the\nMaruts in any way assisted him while performing his great deeds. These deeds\nare the killing of V _ri_ tra, who withholds the waters, i. e. the rain from\nthe earth, and the consequent liberation of the waters, so that they flow down\nfreely for the benefit of Manu, that is, of man.\n\nWhen Indra says that he slew V _ri_ tra indriye _n_ a, he evidently chooses\nthat word with a purpose, and we must therefore translate it here, not only by\nmight, but by Indra's peculiar might. Indriya, as derived from indra, means\noriginally Indra-hood, then power in general, just as verethraghna in Zend\nmeans victory in general, though originally it meant the slaying of V _ri_\ntra.\n\nOn badhim, see Bollensen, Z. D. M. G. XXII, p. 594.\n\np. 199\n\n[paragraph continues] He takes badhim for a contraction of badhisham, in\nanalogy with badhis and badhit. He refers to akramim, X, 166, 5, and badhim,\nX, 28, 7.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x81nutta, in the sense of 'not shaken,' not shakeable, inebranlable, is\nstrange; likewise the genitive, where we expect the instrumental. Still, nud,\nby itself, occurs in similar phrases, e. g. VI, 17, 5, nuttha\xc2\xb4 _h_ a _k_\nyutam, thou shookest what is unshakeable, which might have been expressed by a\n_k_ u _k_ yava _h_ anuttam, and I cannot bring myself to believe that in our\npassage Aufrecht's conjectural emendation is called for. He (K. Z. XXVI, 611)\ntakes anutta for anudatta, like pratta for pradatta, &c., and proposes to omit\nthe negative particle, translating the verse: 'Certainly it is conceded to\nthee, there is none among the gods like unto thee.'\n\nBut though I cannot adopt this emendation here, I think that in other passages\nAufrecht's rendering of anutta is far more appropriate than to take it for\na-nutta; for instance, I, 80, 7; III, 31, 13; VII, 34, 11.\n\nThere remains one verse in which anutta seems to mean not shaken, not\novercome, namely, VIII, 90, 5, tvam v _ri_ tra\xc2\xb4 _n_ i ha _m_ si aprati\xc2\xb4ni eka\n_h_ it anutta _k_ arsha _n_ i-dh _r i_ta, thou, being alone, killest the\nirresistible enemies with the thunderbolt (?). However, anuda, in the sense of\nconceding, yielding, nachgeben, is certainly a very familiar idea in Vedic\npoetry.\n\nII, 12, 10. ya _h_ _s_ ardhate na anu-dadati _s_ _ri_ dhya\xc2\xb4m, who does not\nforgive the hurter his hurt.\n\nI, 53, 8; II, 21, 4; 23, 11; X, 38, 5, Indra is called ananuda _h_ , not\nyielding, not surrendering.\n\nWe must therefore admit two anuttas, one a-nutta, the other anu(da)tta. In\nanutta-manyu I prefer the former, 'of irresistible fury,' while Aufrecht\nprefers the latter, 'of recognised, or universally-admitted fury.'\n\nNote 2. Devata in the ordinary sense of a deity never occurs in the Rig-veda.\nThe word, in fact, as a feminine substantive occurs but twice, and in the\ntenth Ma _n_ _d_ ala\n\np. 200\n\nonly. But even there it does not mean deity. In X, 24, 6, deva _h_ devataya\nmeans, O gods, by your godhead, i. e. by your divine power. In X, 98, 1, b _r\ni_haspate prati me devatam ihi, I take devata in the same sense as devatati,\nand translate, O B _ri_ haspati, come to my sacrifice.\n\nIn all other places where devata occurs in the Rig-veda it is a local adverb,\nand means among the gods. I shall only quote those passages in which Professor\nRoth assigns to devata a different meaning:\n\nI, 55, 3. pra virye\xcc\x83 _n_ a devata ati _k_ ekite.\n\nHe is pre-eminent among the gods by his strength.\n\nI, 22, 5. sa _h_ _k_ etta devata padam.\n\nHe knows the place among the gods.\n\nI, 100, 15. na yasya deva\xc2\xb4 _h_ devata na marta _h_ a\xc2\xb4pa _h_ _k_ ana _s_ avasa\n_h_ antam apu _h_.\n\nHe, the end of whose power neither the gods among the gods, nor mortals, nor\neven the waters have reached.\n\nHere the translation of devata in the sense of 'by their godhead,' would be\nequally applicable, yet nothing would be gained as, in either case, devata is\na weak repetition.\n\nVI, 4, 7. indram na tva _s_ avasa devata vayum p _ri_ _n_ anti ra\xc2\xb4dhasa n _r\ni_-tama _h_.\n\nThe best among men celebrate thee, O Agni, as like unto Indra in strength\namong the gods, as like unto Vayu in liberality. See also devatati, VIII, 74,\n3; X, 8, 2.\n\nNote 3. The juxta-position of _g_ a\xc2\xb4yamana _h_ and _g_ ata _h_ would seem to\nshow that, if the latter had a past, the former had a future meaning. To us,\n'No one who will be born and no one who has been born,' would certainly sound\nmore natural. The Hindu, however, is familiar with the idea as here expressed,\nand in order to comprehend all beings, he speaks of those who are born and\nthose who are being born. Thus in a Pada _s_ ish _t_ a of the Pavamanis (IX,\n67) we read:\n\nyan me garbhe vasata _h_ papam ugram,  \nya _g_ _g_ ayamanasya _k_ a ki _m_ _k_ id anyat,  \n_g_ atasya _k_ a ya _k_ _k_ api vardhato me,  \ntat pavamanibhir aham punami.\n\nNote 4. Karishya\xc2\xb4 is written in all the MSS. without a\n\np. 201\n\n[paragraph continues] Visarga, and unless we add the Visarga on our own\nauthority, we should have to take it as an entirely anomalous acc. plur. neut.\nof a passive participle of the future, karishyam standing for karya\xcc\x83m,\nfaciendum. It is much easier, however, to explain this form if we add the\nVisarga, and read karishya\xc2\xb4 _h_ , which would then be a second person singular\nof a Vedic conjunctive of the future. This form occurs at least once more in\nthe Veda:\n\nIV, 30, 23. uta nunam yat indriyam karishya\xc2\xb4 _h_ indra pau _m_ syam, adya naki\n_h_ tat a\xc2\xb4 minat.\n\nO Indra, let no man destroy to-day whatever manly feat thou art now going to\nachieve.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. As I have translated these words, they sound rather abrupt. The\nmeaning, however, would be clear enough, viz. almighty power belongs to me,\ntherefore I can dare and do. If this abrupt expression should offend, it may\nbe avoided, by taking the participle dadh _ri_ shva\xc2\xb4n as a finite verb, and\ntranslating, Whatever I have been daring, I shall do according to my will.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. In this verse Indra, after having declined with no uncertain sound the\nfriendship of the Maruts, seems to repent himself of his unkindness towards\nhis old friends. The words of praise which they addressed to him in verse 9,\nin spite of the rebuff they had received from Indra, have touched his heart,\nand we may suppose that, after this, their reconciliation was complete. The\nwords of Indra are clear enough, the only difficulty occurs in the last words,\nwhich are so idiomatic that it is impossible to render them in English. In\ntanve\xcc\x83 tanu\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ , literally for the body by the bodies, tang is used like\nthe pronoun self. Both must therefore refer to the same subject. We cannot\ntranslate 'for myself made by yourselves,' but must take the two words\ntogether, so that they should mean, 'the hymn which you have made for your own\nbenefit and by your own exertions.'\n\np. 202\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. Spiegel, in his review, called my attention to the Zend api-vat, which\nBurnouf discussed in his '\xc3\x89tudes,' p. 328. Burnouf tries to show that vat in\nZend has the meaning of knowing, and that it occurs with the preposition api,\nin apivatahe and apivataiti. If this is the same word as in Sanskrit, then\napivatayati would be a causative, meaning to make known. The meaning of vat,\nhowever, is doubtful in Zend, and hardly appropriate in the few passages where\nit occurs in the Veda. Roth, in the Dictionary, explains vat by verstehn,\nbegreifen, the causative by begreiflich machen; but in our passage he\ntranslates it by belebend, Ludwig by aufspurend. Till we get more light, I\nshall feel content to translate apivat by to approach, to obtain, and the\ncausative by to make approach, to invite, to welcome.\n\nThe following are the passages in which api-vat occurs:\n\nVII, 3, 10. api kratum su- _k_ etasam vatema.\n\nMay we obtain an excellent understanding; not, Awaken in us a good sense.\n\nVII, 60, 6. Api kratum su- _k_ etasam vatanta _h_.\n\nThey (Mitra and Varu _n_ a) obtaining an excellent understanding.\n\nI, 128, 2. tam ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a-sa\xc2\xb4dham api vatayamasi.\n\nHim, Agni, the performer of the sacrifice, we make approach, we invite.\n\nX, 20, I; 25, 1. bhadram na _h_ api vataya mana _h_ , daksham uta kratum.\n\nBring to us, i. e. give us, a good mind, and a strong understanding.\n\nX, 13, 5. pitre putra\xc2\xb4sa _h_ api avivatan _ri_ tam.\n\nThe sons obtained the right for the father (an obscure verse).\n\nAs to svapivata, VII, 46, 3, I should derive it from van, in the sense of\nimplored, desired; see, however, Muir, Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 314, note;\nNirukta, ed. Roth, p. 135.\n\nNote 2. On naveda _h_ , see IV, 23, 4.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. This is a verse which, without some conjectural\n\np. 203\n\nalterations, it seems impossible to translate. Saya _n_ a, of course, has a\ntranslation ready for it, so has M. Langlois, but both of them offend against\nthe simplest rules of grammar and logic. The first question is, who is meant\nby asma\xc2\xb4n (which is here used as an amphimacer), the sacrificers or the\nMaruts? The verb a\xc2\xb4 _k_ akre would well apply to the medha\xc2\xb4 manyasya, the hymn\nof Manya, which is intended to bring the Maruts to the sacrifice, this\nbringing to the sacrifice being the very meaning of a kar. But then we have\nthe vocative maruta _h_ in the next line, and even if we changed the vocative\ninto the accusative, we should not gain much, as the Maruts could hardly call\nupon anybody to turn them towards the sage.\n\nIf, on the contrary, we admit that asma\xc2\xb4n refers to those who offer the\nsacrifice, then we must make a distinction, which, it is true, is not an\nunusual one, between those who here speak of themselves in the first person,\nand who provide the sacrifice, and the poet Mandarya Manya, who was employed\nby them to compose or to recite this hymn.\n\nBut even if we adopt this alternative, many difficulties still remain. First\nof all, we have to change the accent of _k_ akre into _k_ akre, which may seem\na slight change, but is not the less objectionable when we consider that in\nour emendations of the Vedic hymns we must think rather of accidents that\nmight happen in oral traditions than of the lapsus calami of later scribes.\nSecondly, we must suppose that the hymn of Mandarya Manya ends with verse 13,\nsand that the last verses were supplied by the sacrificers themselves.\nPossibly the dialogue only, from verse 3 to verse 12, was the work of Manya,\nand the rest added at some solemn occasion.\n\nOther difficulties, however, remain. Duvasya\xc2\xb4t is taken by Saya _n_ a as an\nablative of duvasya, worthy of duvas, i. e. of worship, of sacrifice.\nUnfortunately this duvasya does not occur again, though it would be formed\nquite regularly, like namasya\xc2\xb4, worthy of worship, from namas, worship.\n\nIf we take duvasya\xc2\xb4t as the 3rd pers. sing. of the present in the Vedic\nconjunctive, we must also confess that this conjunctive does not occur again.\nBut the verb duvasyati\n\np. 204\n\noccurs frequently. It seems to have two meanings. It is derived from duvas,\nwhich in the Vedic language means worship or sacrifice, just as karma, work,\nhas assumed the special sense of sacrifice. Derived from duvas in this sense,\nduvasyati means to worship. But duvas meant originally any opus operatum. The\nroot from which duvas is derived, is lost in Sanskrit, but it exists in other\nlanguages. It must have been du or du in the sense of acting, or sedulously\nworking. It exists in Zend as du, to do, in Gothic as taujan, gataujan, Old\nHigh-German zawjan, Modern German zauen (Grimm, Gram. i2. p. 1041). The Gothic\ntavi, opus, Old High-German zouwi, Middle High-German gezouwe (Grimm, Gram.\niii. p. 499), come from the same source; and it is possible, too, that the Old\nNorse taufr, modern tofrar, incantamenta, the Old High-German zoupar, Middle\nHigh-German zouber, both neuter, and the modern Zauber, may find their\nexplanation in the Sanskrit duvas. Derived from duvas, in the sense of work,\nwe have duvasyati in the sense of helping, providing, the German schaffen and\nverschaffen.\n\nIn the sense of worshipping, duvasyati occurs,\n\nIII, 2, 8. duvasyata-- _g_ ata-vedasam.\n\nWorship Gatavedas.\n\nV, 28, 6. a\xc2\xb4 _g_ uhota duvasyata agnim.\n\nInvoke, worship Agni. Cf. III, 13, 3; 1, 13.\n\nIII, 3, 1. agni _h_ hi deva\xc2\xb4n--duvasyati.\n\nAgni performs the worship of the gods. Cf. VII, 82, 5.\n\nI, 167, 6. suta-soma _h_ duvasyan.\n\nHe who has poured out Soma and worships.\n\nIn many passages duvasyati is joined with an instrumental:\n\nV, 42, 11. nama _h_ -bhi _h_ devam--duvasya.\n\nWorship the god with praises.\n\nI, 78, 2. tam u tva gotama _h_ gira\xc2\xb4--duvasyati.\n\nGotama worships thee with a song.\n\nV, 49, 2. su-uktai _h_ devam--duvasya.\n\nWorship the god with hymns.\n\nVI, 16, 46. viti\xc2\xb4 ya _h_ devam--duvasyet.\n\nHe who worships the god with a feast.\n\np. 205\n\nX, 14, 1. yamam--havisha duvasya.\n\nWorship Yama with an oblation.\n\nVI, 15, 6. agnim-agnim va _h_ samidha duvasyata.\n\nWorship Agni with your log of wood. Cf. VIII, 44, 1.\n\nIII, 1, 2. samit-bhi _h_ agnim namasa duvasyan.\n\nThey worshipped Agni with logs of wood, with praise.\n\nIn the more general and, I suppose, more original sense of caring for,\nattending, we find duvasyati:\n\nIII, 51, 3. anehasa _h_ stubha _h_ indra _h_ duvasyati.\n\nIndra provides for the matchless worshippers.\n\nI, 112, 15. kalim ya\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ --duvasyatha _h_.\n\nBy the succours with which you help Kali. Cf. I, 112, 21.\n\nI, 62, 10. duvasyanti svasara _h_ ahraya _n_ am.\n\nThe sisters attend the proud (Agni).\n\nI, 119, 10. yuvam pedave-- _s_ vetam--duvasyatha _h_.\n\nYou provide for Pedu the white horse.\n\nIf, then, we take duvasyati in the sense of working for, assisting, it may be\nwith the special sense of assisting at a sacred act, like \xce\xb4\xce\xb9\xce\xb1\xce\xba\xce\xbf\xce\xbd\xce\xb5\xe1\xbf\x96\xce\xbd; and if we\ntake duvas, as it has the accent on the last syllable, as the performer of a\nsacrifice, we may venture to translate, 'that he should help, as the singer\nhelps the performer of the sacrifice a': The singer or the poet may be called\nthe assistant at a sacrifice, for his presence was not necessary at all\nsacrifices, the songs constituting an ornament rather than an essential part\nin most sacred acts. But though I think it right to offer this conjectural\ninterpretation, I am far from supposing that it gives us the real sense of\nthis difficult verse. Duvasya\xc2\xb4t may be, as Saya _n_ a suggests, an ablative of\nduvasya; and duvasya, like namasya\xc2\xb4, if we change the accent, may mean he who\nis to be worshipped, or worshipping. In this way a different interpretation\nmight suggest itself, though I confess I do not see that any other\ninterpretation as yet suggested is satisfactory. Some happy thought may some\nday or other clear up this difficulty, when those who have\n\np. 206\n\ntoiled, but toiled in a wrong direction, will receive scant thanks for the\ntrouble they have taken. See Bollensen, Z. D. M. G. XVIII, p. 606.\n\nNote 2. In the second line, the words o su varta remind us of similar phrases\nin the Veda, but we want an accusative, governed by varta; whereas maruta _h_\n, to judge from its accent, can only be a vocative. Thus we read:\n\nI, 138, 4. o (iti) su tva vav _ri_ timahi stomebhi _h_.\n\nMay we turn thee quickly hither by our praises!\n\nVIII, 7, 83. o (iti) su v _r i_sh _n_ a _h_ --vav _ri_ tya\xc2\xb4m.\n\nMay I turn the heroes quickly hither!\n\nCompare also passages like III, 33, 8:\n\no (iti) su svasara _h_ karave _s_ _ri_ _n_ ota.\n\nListen quickly, O sisters, to the poet.\n\nI, 139, 7. o (iti) su na _h_ agne _s_ _ri_ _n_ uhi.\n\nHear us quickly, O Agni.\n\nCf. I, 182, 1; II, 34, 15; VII, 59, 5; VIII, 2, 19; X, 179, 2.\n\nUnless we change the accent, we must translate, 'Bring hither quickly!' and we\nmust take these words as addressed to the karu, the poet, whose hymn is\nsupposed to attract the gods to the sacrifice. By a quick transition, the next\nwords, maruta _h_ vipram a _k_ _kh_ a, would then have to be taken as\naddressed to the gods, 'Maruts, on to the sage!' and the last words would\nbecome intelligible by laying stress on the va _h_ , 'for you, and not for\nIndra or any other god, has the singer recited these hymns.' See, however,\nPreface, [p. xxi](sbe3202.htm#page_xxi).\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. I translate Manya, the son of Mana, because the poet, so called in I,\n189, 8, is in all probability the same as our Mandarya Manya. But it may also\nbe Manya, the descendant of Mandari. The Manas are mentioned I, 172, 5;182, 8.\n\nNote 2. Va _g_.. S. XXXIV, 48. The second line is difficult, owing to the\nuncertain meaning of vaya\xc2\xb4m.\n\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xb4 isha\xc2\xb4 a yasish _t_ a has been rendered, 'Come hither with\n\np. 207\n\nwater or drink or rain,' yasish _t_ a being the aorist without the augment and\nwith the intermediate vowel lengthened. The indicative occurs in\n\nV, 58, 6. yat pra ayasish _t_ a p _r i_shatibhi _h_ a _s_ vai _h_.\n\nWhen you Maruts came forth with your fallow deer and your horses.\n\nBut what is the meaning of vaya\xc2\xb4m? Vaya\xc2\xb4 means a germ, a sprout, an offshoot,\na branch, as may be seen from the following passages:\n\nII, 5, 4. vidva\xc2\xb4n asya vrata\xc2\xb4 dhruva\xc2\xb4 vaya\xc2\xb4 _h_ -iva anu rohate.\n\nHe who knows his eternal laws, springs up like young sprouts. (Better\nvaya\xc2\xb4-iva.)\n\nVI, 7, 6. tasya it u _m_ (iti) vi _s_ va bhuvana adhi murdhani vaya\xc2\xb4 _h_ -iva\nruruhu _h_.\n\nFrom above the head of Vai _s_ vanara all worlds have grown; like young\nsprouts.\n\nVIII, 13, 6. stota\xc2\xb4--vaya\xc2\xb4 _h_ -iva anu rohate. (Better vaya\xc2\xb4-iva.)\n\nThe worshipper grows up like young sprouts.\n\nVIII, 13, 17. indram ksho _n_ i\xc2\xb4 _h_ avardhayan vaya\xc2\xb4 _h_ -iva.\n\nThe people made Indra to grow like young sprouts.\n\nVIII, 19, 33. yasya te agne anye agnaya _h_ upa-kshita _h_ vaya\xc2\xb4 _h_ -iva.\n\nAgni, of whom the other fires are like parasitical shoots.\n\nI, 59, 1. vaya\xc2\xb4 _h_ it agne agnaya _h_ te anye.\n\nO Agni, the other fires are indeed offshoots of thee.\n\nII, 35, 8. vaya\xc2\xb4 _h_ it anya\xc2\xb4 bhuvanani asya.\n\nThe other worlds are indeed his (the rising sun's) offshoots.\n\nVI, 13, 1. tvat vi _s_ va--saubhagani agne vi yanti vanina _h_ na vaya\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nFrom thee O Agni, spring all happinesses, as the sprouts of a tree.\n\nVI, 24, 3. v _ri_ kshasya nu (na?) te--vaya\xc2\xb4 _h_ vi utaya _h_ ruruhu _h_.\n\nSuccours sprang from thee, like the branches of a tree.\n\nV, 1, 1. yahva\xc2\xb4 _h_ -iva pra vaya\xc2\xb4m ut- _g_ ihana _h_ pra bhanava _h_ sisrate\nna\xc2\xb4kam a _k_ _kh_ a.\n\nLike birds (?) flying up to a branch, the flames of Agni went up to heaven;\n(or like strong men reaching up to.)\n\np. 208\n\nVI, 57, 5. ta\xc2\xb4m push _n_ a _h_ su-matim vayam v _ri_ kshasya pra vaya\xc2\xb4m-iva\nindrasya _k_ a a\xc2\xb4 rabhamahe.\n\nLet us reach this favour of Pushan and of Indra, as one reaches forth to the\nbranch of a tree.\n\nThere remain some doubtful passages in which vaya\xc2\xb4 occurs, VII, 40, 5, and X,\n92, 3; 134, 6. In the first passage, as in our own, vaya\xc2\xb4 _h_ is trisyllabic.\n\nIf vaya\xc2\xb4 can be used in the sense of offshoot or sprout, we may conclude that\nthe same word, used in the singular, might mean offspring, particularly when\njoined with tanve\xcc\x83. 'Give a branch to our body,' would be understood even in\nlanguages less metaphorical than that of the Vedas; and as the prayer for\n'olive branches' is a constant theme of the Vedic poets, the very absence of\nthat prayer here, might justify us in assigning this sense to vaya\xc2\xb4m. In VI,\n2, 5, the expression vaya\xc2\xb4vantam kshayam, a house with branches, means the\nsame as n _ri_ vantam, a house with children and men. See M. M., On \xce\x92\xce\xaf\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 and\nvayas, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xv, p. 215. Benfey (Endungen in ians, p.\n37) takes vayam as a genitive plural, referring it to the Maruts, as closely\nconnected with each other, like branches of a tree. This is much the same\ninterpretation as that of Mahidhara (VS. XXXIV, 48), who translates 'come near\nfor the body, i. e. for the bodily strength of the fellows, the Maruts.'\nLudwig takes it as a possible instrumental of vayam.\n\nIt is preferable, however, to take yasish _t_ a as a precative \xc3\x82tm., in order\nto account for the long i, and to accept it as a third person singular,\nreferring to stoma _h_.\n\nNote 3. V _ri_ _g_ ana means an enclosure, a \xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, whether it be derived from\nv _ri_ _g_ , to ward off; like arx from arcere, or from v _ri_ _g_ , in the\nsense of clearing, as in v _ri_ kta-barhis, barhi _h_ pra. v _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ e,\nI, 116, 1. In either case the meaning remains much the same, viz. a field,\ncleared for pasture or agriculture,--a clearing, as it is called in America,\nor a camp,--enclosed with hurdles or walls, so as to be capable of defence\nagainst wild animals or against enemies. In this sense, however, v _ri_ _g_\nana is a neuter, while as a masculine it means powerful, invigorating.
