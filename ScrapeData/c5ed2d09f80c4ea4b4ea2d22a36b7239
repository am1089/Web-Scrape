The great muni Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya went to A\xe1\xb8\x8di\xe1\xb9\xadyaloka (the sun\'s world) and\nsaluting him (the Purusha of the sun) said: "O reverend sir, describe to me\nthe \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81-\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva (the \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva or truth of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81)."\n\n(To which,) N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a ( _viz_., the Purusha of the sun) replied: "I shall\ndescribe the eightfold yoga together with J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na. The conquering of cold and\nheat as well as hunger and sleep, the preserving of (sweet) patience and\nunruffledness ever and the restraining of the organs (from sensual\nobjects)--all these come under (or are) yama. Devotion to one\'s guru, love of\nthe true path, enjoyment of objects producing happiness, internal\nsatisfaction, freedom from association, living in a retired place, the\ncontrolling of the manas and the not longing after the fruits of actions and a\nstate of vair\xc4\x81gya--all these [constitute](errata.htm#17) niyama. The sitting\nin any posture pleasant to one and clothed in tatters (or bark) is prescribed\nfor \xc4\x81sana (posture). Inspiration, restraint of breath and expiration, which\nhave respectively 16, 64 and 32 (m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s) constitute pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma (restraint of\nbreath). The restraining of the mind from the objects of\n\np. 244\n\nsenses is pra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra (subjugation of the senses). The contemplation of the\noneness of consciousness in all objects is \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na. The mind having been drawn\naway from the objects of the senses, the fixing of the chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya\n(consciousness) (on one alone) is \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81. The forgetting of oneself in \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na\nis sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. He who thus knows the eight subtle parts of yoga attains\nsalvation.\n\n"The body has five stains ( _viz_.,) passion, anger, out-breathing, fear, and\nsleep. The removal of these can be effected respectively by absence of\nsa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa, forgiveness, moderate food, carefulness, and a spiritual sight of\n\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvas. In order to cross the ocean of sams\xc4\x81ra where sleep and fear are the\nserpents, injury, etc., are the waves, \xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\x9bsh\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 (thirst) is the whirlpool, and\nwife is the mire, one should adhere to the subtle path and overstepping \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva\n1 and other gu\xe1\xb9\x87as should look out for \xe1\xb9\xac\xc4\x81raka. 2 \xe1\xb9\xac\xc4\x81raka is Brahman which being\nin the middle of the two eyebrows, is of the nature of the spiritual\n[effulgence](errata.htm#18) of Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da. The (spiritual) seeing through\nthe three lakshyas (or the three kinds of introvision) is the means to It\n(Brahman). Sushumn\xc4\x81 which is from the m\xc5\xabl\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra to brahmaran\xe1\xb8\x8dhra has the\nradiance of the sun. In the centre of it, is kun\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab shining like crores of\nlightning and subtle as the thread in the lotus-stalk. \xe1\xb9\xacamas is destroyed\nthere. Through seeing it, all sins are destroyed. When the two ears are closed\nby the tips of the forefingers, a ph\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadk\xc4\x81ra (or booming) sound is heard. When\nthe mind is fixed on it, it sees a blue light between the eyes as also in the\nheart. (This is an\xe1\xb9\xadarlakshya or internal [introvision](errata.htm#19)). In the\nbahirlakshya (or external introvision) one sees in order before his nose at\ndistance of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 digits, the space of blue colour, then a\ncolour resembling \xc5\x9by\xc4\x81ma (indigo-black) and then shining as rak\xe1\xb9\xada (red) wave\nand then with the two p\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada (yellow and orange red) colours. Then he is a\nyogin. When one looks at the external space, moving\n\np. 245\n\nthe eyes and sees streaks of light at the corners of his eyes, then his vision\ncan be made steady. When one sees jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis (spiritual light) above his head 12\ndigits in length, then he attains the state of nectar. In the ma\xe1\xb8\x8dhyalakshya\n(or the middle one), one sees the variegated colours of the morning as if the\nsun, the moon and the fire had joined together in the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b that is without\nthem. Then he comes to have their nature (of light). Through practice, he\nbecomes one with \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, devoid of all gu\xe1\xb9\x87as and peculiarities. At first \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b\nwith its shining stars becomes to him Para-\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b as dark as \xe1\xb9\xadamas itself, and\nhe becomes one with Para-\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b shining with stars and deep as \xe1\xb9\xadamas. (Then) he\nbecomes one with Mah\xc4\x81-\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b resplendent (as) with the fire of the deluge. Then\nhe becomes one with \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva-\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, lighted with the brightness which is the\nhighest and the best of all. Then he becomes one with S\xc5\xabrya-\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b (sun-\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b)\nbrightened by a crore of suns. By practising thus, he becomes one with them.\nHe who knows them becomes thus.\n\n"Know that yoga is twofold through its division into the p\xc5\xabrva (earlier) and\nthe u\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadara (later). The earlier is \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81raka and the later is amanaska (the\nmindless). \xe1\xb9\xac\xc4\x81raka is divided into m\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb9\xadi (with limitation) and am\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb9\xadi (without\nlimitation). That is m\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb9\xadi \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81raka which goes to the end of the senses (or\nexists till the senses are conquered). That is am\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb9\xadi \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81raka which goes beyond\nthe two eyebrows (above the senses). Both these should be performed through\nmanas. An\xe1\xb9\xadar\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb9\x9bshti (internal vision) associated with manas comes to aid\n\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81raka. \xe1\xb9\xacejas (spiritual light) appears in the hole between the two eyebrows.\nThis \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81raka is the earlier one. The later is amanaska. The great jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis\n(light) 1 is above the root of the palate. By seeing it, one gets the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis\na\xe1\xb9\x87im\xc4\x81, etc. \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81mbhav\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81 occurs when the lakshya (spiritual vision) is\ninternal while the (physical) eyes are seeing externally without winking. This\nis the great science which is concealed in all the tan\xe1\xb9\xadras. When this is\nknown, one does not stay in sams\xc4\x81ra. Its worship (or practice) gives\nsalvation. An\xe1\xb9\xadarlakshya is of\n\np. 246\n\nthe nature of Jalajyo\xe1\xb9\xadis (or waterjyotis). It is known by the great \xe1\xb9\x9ashis and\nis invisible both to the internal and external senses.\n\n"Sahasr\xc4\x81ra ( _viz_., the thousand-petalled lotus of the pineal gland)\nJalajyo\xe1\xb9\xadis 1 is the an\xe1\xb9\xadarlakshya. Some say the form of Purusha in the cave of\nbu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi beautiful in all its parts is an\xe1\xb9\xadarlakshya. Some again say that the\nall-quiescent N\xc4\xablaka\xe1\xb9\x87tha accompanied by Um\xc4\x81 (his wife) and having five mouths\nand latent in the midst of the sphere in the brain is an\xe1\xb9\xadarlakshya. Whilst\nothers say that the Purusha of the dimension of a thumb is an\xe1\xb9\xadarlakshya. A few\nagain say an\xe1\xb9\xadarlakshya is the One Self made supreme through introvision in the\nstate of a j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada. All the different statements above made pertain to \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81\nalone. He alone is a Brahmanishtha who sees that the above lakshya is the pure\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. The j\xc4\xabva which is the twenty-fifth \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva, having abandoned the twenty-\nfour \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvas, becomes a j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada through the conviction that the twenty-\nsixth \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva ( _viz_.,) Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is \'I\' alone. Becoming one with an\xe1\xb9\xadarlakshya\n(Brahman) in the emancipated state by means of an\xe1\xb9\xadarlakshya (introvision),\nj\xc4\xabva becomes one with the partless sphere of Param\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b.\n\n"Thus ends the first Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a."\n\n##### Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a II\n\nThen Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya asked the Purusha in the sphere of the sun: "O Lord,\nan\xe1\xb9\xadarlakshya has been described many times, but it has never been understood\nby me (clearly). Pray describe it to me." He replied: "It is the source of the\nfive elements, has the lustre of many (streaks of) lightning, and has four\nseats having (or rising from) \'That\' (Brahman). In its midst, there arises the\nmanifestation of \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva. It is very hidden and unmanifested. It can be known\n(only) by one who has got into the boat of j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na. It is the object of both\nbahir and an\xe1\xb9\xadar (external and internal) lakshyas. In its midst is absorbed\n\np. 247\n\nthe whole world. It is the vast partless universe beyond N\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da, Bin\xe1\xb8\x8du and Kara.\nAbove it ( _viz_., the sphere of agni) is the sphere of the sun; in its midst\nis the sphere of the nectary moon; in its midst is the sphere of the partless\nBrahma-\xe1\xb9\xadejas (or the spiritual effulgence of Brahman). It has the brightness\nof \xc5\x9aukla (white light) 1 like the ray of lightning. It alone has the\ncharacteristic of \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81mbhav\xc4\xab. In seeing this, there are three kinds of \xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb9\x9bshti\n(sight), _viz_., am\xc4\x81 (the new moon), pra\xe1\xb9\xadipa\xe1\xb9\xad (the first day of lunar\nfortnight), and p\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb9\x87im\xc4\x81 (the full moon). The sight of am\xc4\x81 is the one (seen)\nwith closed eyes. That with half opened eyes is pra\xe1\xb9\xadipa\xe1\xb9\xad; while that with\nfully opened eyes is p\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb9\x87im\xc4\x81. Of these, the practice of p\xc5\xabr\xe1\xb9\x87im\xc4\x81 should be\nresorted to. Its lakshya (or aim) is the tip of the nose. Then is seen a deep\ndarkness at the root of the palate. By practising thus, a jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis (light) of\nthe form of an endless sphere is seen. This alone is Brahman, the\nSachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da. When the mind is absorbed in bliss thus naturally produced,\nthen does \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81mbhav\xc4\xab take place. She (\xc5\x9a\xc4\x81mbhav\xc4\xab) alone is called Khechar\xc4\xab. By\npractising it ( _viz_., the mu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81), a man obtains firmness of mind. Through\nit, he obtains firmness of v\xc4\x81yu. The following are the signs: first it is seen\nlike a star; then a reflecting (or dazzling) diamond; 2 then the sphere of\nfull moon; then the sphere of the brightness of nine gems; then the sphere of\nthe midday sun; then the sphere of the flame of agni (fire); all these are\nseen in order.\n\n"(Thus much for the light in p\xc5\xabrva or first stage.) Then there is the light in\nthe western direction (in the u\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadara or second stage). Then the lustres of\ncrystal, smoke, bin\xe1\xb8\x8du, n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da, kal\xc4\x81, star, firefly, lamp, eye, gold, and nine\ngems, etc. are seen. This alone is the form of Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava. Having united Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a\nand Ap\xc4\x81na and holding the breath in kumbhaka, one should fix his concentration\nat the tip of his nose and making sha\xe1\xb9\x87mukhi 3 with the fingers of both his\nhands, one hears\n\np. 248\n\nthe sound of Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava (Om) in which manas becomes absorbed. Such a man has not\neven the touch of karma. The karma of (San\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81van\xe1\xb8\x8dana or the daily prayers) is\nverily performed at the rising or setting of the sun. As there is no rising or\nsetting (but only the ever shining) of the sun of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad (the higher\nconsciousness) in the heart of a man who knows thus, he has no karma to\nperform. Rising above (the conception of) day and night through the\nannihilation of sound and time, he becomes one with Brahman through the all-\nfull j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and the attaining of the state of unman\xc4\xab (the state above manas).\nThrough the state of unman\xc4\xab, he becomes amanaska (or without manas).\n\n"Not being troubled by any thoughts (of the world) then constitutes the\n\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na. 1 The abandoning of all karmas constitutes \xc4\x81v\xc4\x81hana (invocation of\ngod). Being firm in the unshaken (spiritual) wisdom constitutes \xc4\x81sana\n(posture). Being in the state of unman\xc4\xab constitutes the p\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dya (offering of\nwater for washing the feet of god). Preserving the state of amanaska (when\nmanas is offered as sacrifice) constitutes the arghya (offering of water as\noblation generally). Being in state of eternal brightness and shoreless nectar\nconstitutes sn\xc4\x81na (bathing). The contemplation of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as present in all\nconstitutes (the application to the idol of) sandal. The remaining in the real\nstate of the \xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb9\x9bk (spiritual eye) is (the worshipping with) aksha\xe1\xb9\xada;(non-broken\nrice). The attaining of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad (consciousness) is (the worshipping with) flower.\nThe real state of agni (fire) of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad is the \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xabpa (burning of incense). The\nstate of the sun of Chi\xe1\xb9\xad is the \xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\xabpa (light waved before the image). The union\nof oneself with the nectar of full moon is the naiv\xc4\x93\xe1\xb8\x8dya (offering of food,\netc.). 2 The immobility in that state (of the ego being one with all) is\npra\xe1\xb8\x8dakshi\xe1\xb9\x87a (going round the image). The conception of \'I am He\' is namask\xc4\x81ra\n(prostration). The silence (then) is the s\xe1\xb9\xadu\xe1\xb9\xadi (praise). The all-contentment\n(or serenity then) is the visarjana (giving leave to god or finishing\nworship). (This is\n\np. 249\n\nthe worship of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 by all Raja-yogins). He who knows this knows all.\n\n"When the \xe1\xb9\xadriputi 1 are thus dispelled, he becomes the kaivalya jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis without\nbh\xc4\x81va (existence) or abh\xc4\x81va (nonexistence), full and motionless, like the\nocean without the tides or like the lamp without the wind. He becomes a\nbrahmavi\xe1\xb9\xad (knower of Brahman) by cognising the end of the sleeping state, even\nwhile in the waking state. Though the (same) mind is absorbed in sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi as\nalso in sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, there is much difference between them. (In the former case)\nas the mind is absorbed in \xe1\xb9\xadamas, it does not become the means of salvation,\n(but) in sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi as the modifications of \xe1\xb9\xadamas in him are rooted away, the\nmind raises itself to the nature of the Partless. All that is no other than\nS\xc4\x81kshi-Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya (witness-consciousness or the Higher Self) into which the\nabsorption of the whole universe takes place, inasmuch as the universe is but\na delusion (or creation) of the mind and is therefore not different from it.\nThough the universe appears perhaps as outside of the mind, still it is\nunreal. He who knows Brahman and who is the sole enjoyer of br\xc4\x81hmic bliss\nwhich is eternal and has dawned once (for all in him)--that man becomes one\nwith Brahman. He in whom sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa perishes has got muk\xe1\xb9\xadi in his hand.\nTherefore one becomes an emancipated person through the contemplation of\nParam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Having given up both bh\xc4\x81va and abh\xc4\x81va, one becomes a j\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada by\nleaving off again and again in all states j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na (wisdom) and j\xc3\xb1eya (object of\nwisdom), \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na (meditation) and \xe1\xb8\x8dhyeya (object of meditation), lakshya (the\naim) and alakshya (non-aim), \xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb9\x9b\xc5\x9bya (the visible) and a\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb9\x9b\xc5\x9bya (the non-visible\nand \xc5\xabha (reasoning) and apoha (negative reasoning). 2 He who knows this knows\nall.\n\n"There are five avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81s (states), _viz_.: j\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xad (waking), svapna (dreaming),\nsushup\xe1\xb9\xadi (dreamless sleeping), the \xe1\xb9\xadurya (fourth) and tury\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada (that beyond\nthe fourth). The j\xc4\xabva (ego) that is engaged in the waking state becomes\nattached to the prav\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi (worldly) path and is the participator of naraka\n(hell) as the\n\np. 250\n\nfruit of sins. He desires svarga (heaven) as the fruit of his virtuous\nactions. This very same person becomes (afterwards) indifferent to all these\nsaying, "Enough of the births tending to actions, the fruits of which tend to\nbondage till the end of this mundane existence." Then he pursues the niv\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi\n(return) path with a view to attain emancipation. And this person then takes\nrefuge in a spiritual instructor in order to cross this mundane existence.\nGiving up passion and others, he does only those he is asked to do. Then\nhaving acquired the four s\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhanas (means to salvation), he attains, in the\nmiddle of the lotus of his heart, the Reality of an\xe1\xb9\xadarlakshya that is but the\nSa\xe1\xb9\xad of Lord and begins to recognise (or recollect) the bliss of Brahman which\nhe had left (or enjoyed) in his sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi state. At last he attains this state\nof discrimination (thus): \'I think I am the non-dual One only. I was in aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na\nfor some time (in the waking state and called therefore Vi\xc5\x9bva). I became\nsomehow (or involuntarily) a \xe1\xb9\xacaijasa (in the dreaming state) through the\nreflection (in that state) of the affinities of the forgotten waking state;\nand now I am a Pr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1a through the disappearance of those two states. Therefore\nI am one only. I (appear) as more than one through the differences of state\nand place. And there is nothing of differentiation of class besides me.\'\nHaving expelled even the smack of the difference (of conception) between \'I\'\nand \'That\' through the thought \'I am the pure and the secondless Brahman\', and\nhaving attained the path of salvation which is of the nature of Parabrahman,\nafter having become one with It through the \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na of the sun\'s sphere as\nshining with himself, he becomes fully ripened for getting salvation. Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa\nand others are the causes of the bondage of the mind; and the mind devoid of\nthese becomes fit for salvation. Possessing such a mind free from all\n(sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa, etc.,) and withdrawing himself from the outer world of sight and\nothers and so keeping himself out of the odour of the universe, he looks upon\nall the world as \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, abandons the conception of \'I\', thinks I am Brahman\'\nand considers all these as \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Through these, he becomes one who has done\nhis duty.\n\np. 251\n\n"The yogin is one that has realised Brahman that is all-full beyond \xe1\xb9\xadurya.\nThey (the people) extol him as Brahman; and becoming the object of the praise\nof the whole world, he wanders over different countries. Placing the bin\xe1\xb8\x8du in\nthe \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b of Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and pursuing the path of the partless bliss produced by\nthe pure, secondless, stainless, and innate yoga sleep of amanaska, he becomes\nan emancipated person. Then the yogin becomes immersed in the ocean of bliss.\nWhen compared to it, the bliss of In\xe1\xb8\x8dra and others is very little. He who gets\nthis bliss is the supreme yogin.\n\n"Thus ends the second Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a."\n\n##### Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a III\n\nThe great sage Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya then asked the Purusha in the sphere (of the sun):\n"O Lord, though the nature of amanaska has been defined (by you), yet I forget\nit (or do not understand it clearly). Therefore pray explain it again to me."\nAccordingly the Purusha said: "This amanaska is a great secret. By knowing\nthis, one becomes a person who has done his duty. One should look upon it as\nParam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, associated with \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81mbhav\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81 and should know also all those that\ncan be known through a (thorough) cognition of them. Then seeing Parabrahman\nin his own \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma as the Lord of all, the immeasurable, the birthless, the\nauspicious, the supreme \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, the supportless, the secondless the only goal of\nBrahma, Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u and Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra and the cause of all and assuring himself that he who\nplays in the cave (of the heart) is such a one, he should raise himself above\nthe dualities of existence and non-existence; and knowing the experience of\nthe unman\xc4\xab of his manas, he then attains the state of Parabrahman which is\nmotionless as a lamp in a windless place, having reached the ocean of br\xc4\x81hmic\nbliss by means of the river of amanaska-yoga through the destruction of all\nhis senses. Then he resembles a dry tree. Having lost all (idea of) the\nuniverse through the disappearance of growth, sleep, disease, expiration and\ninspiration, his body being always steady, he comes to have a supreme\nquiescence, being devoid of the movements of\n\np. 252\n\nhis manas and becomes absorbed in Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma. The destruction of manas takes\nplace after the destruction of the collective senses, like the cow\'s udder\n(that shrivels up) after the milk has been drawn. It is this that is amanaska.\nBy following this, one becomes always pure and becomes one that has done his\nduty, having been filled with the partless bliss by means of the path of\n\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81raka-yoga through the initiation into the sacred sentences \'I am Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81,\'\n\'That art thou,\' \'I am thou alone,\' \'Thou art I alone,\' etc.\n\n"When his manas is immersed in the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b and he becomes all-full, and when he\nattains the unman\xc4\xab state, having abandoned all his collective senses, he\nconquers all sorrows and impurities through the partless bliss, having\nattained the fruits of kaivalya, ripened through the collective merits\ngathered in all his previous lives and thinking always \'I am Brahman,\' becomes\none that has done his duty. \'I am thou alone. There is no difference between\nthee and me owing to the fullness of Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81.\' Saying thus, he (the Purusha\nof the sun) embraced his pupil 1 and made him understand it.\n\n"Thus ends the third Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a."\n\n##### Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a IV\n\nThen Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya addressed the Purusha in the sphere (of the sun) thus: "Pray\nexplain to me in detail the nature of the fivefold division of \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b." He\nreplied: "There are five ( _viz_.): \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, par\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, mah\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, s\xc5\xabry\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, and\nparam\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. That which is of the nature of darkness, both in and out is the\nfirst \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. That which has the fire of the deluge, both in and out is truly\nmah\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. That which has the brightness of the sun, both in and out is\ns\xc5\xabry\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. That brightness which is indescribable, all-pervading and of the\nnature of unrivalled bliss is param\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. By cognising these according to this\ndescription, one becomes of their nature. He is a yogin only in name, who does\nnot cognise well the nine chakras, the six \xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ras, the three lakshyas and the\nfive \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. Thus ends the fourth Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a."\n\np. 253\n\n##### Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a V\n\n"The manas influenced by worldly objects is liable to bondage; and that\n(manas) which is not so influenced by these is fit for salvation. Hence all\nthe world becomes an object of chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada; whereas the same chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada when it is\nsupportless and well-ripe in the state of unman\xc4\xab, becomes worthy of laya\n(absorption in Brahman). This absorption you should learn from me who am the\nall-full. I alone am the cause of the absorption of manas. The manas is within\nthe jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis (spiritual light) which again is latent in the spiritual sound\nwhich pertains to the an\xc4\x81ha\xe1\xb9\xada (heart) sound. That manas which is the agent of\ncreation, preservation, and destruction of the three worlds--that same manas\nbecomes absorbed in that which is the highest seat of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u; through such an\nabsorption, one gets the pure and secondless state, owing to the absence of\ndifference then. This alone is the highest truth. He who knows this, will\nwander in the world like a lad or an idiot or a demon or a simpleton. By\npractising this amanaska, one is ever contented, his urine and faeces become\ndiminished, his food becomes lessened: he becomes strong in body and his limbs\nare free from disease and sleep. Then his breath and eyes being motionless, he\nrealises Brahman and attains the nature of bliss.\n\n"That ascetic who is intent on drinking the nectar of Brahman produced by the\nlong practice of this kind of sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, becomes a paramahamsa (ascetic) or an\nava\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada (naked ascetic). By seeing him, all the world becomes pure, and even\nan illiterate person who serves him is freed from bondage. He (the ascetic)\nenables the members of his family for one hundred and one generations to cross\nthe ocean of sams\xc4\x81ra; and his mother, father, wife, and children--all these\nare similarly freed. Thus is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d. Thus ends the fifth Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[243:1](tmu30.htm#fr_225) Ma\xe1\xb9\x87dala means sphere. As the Purusha in the ma\xe1\xb9\x87dala\nor sphere of the sun gives out this Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d to Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya, hence it is\ncalled Ma\xe1\xb9\x87dala-Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a. It is very mystic. There is a book called _R \xc4\x81jayoga\nBh\xc4\x81shya_ which is a commentary thereon; in the light of it which is by some\nattributed to \xc5\x9ari Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kar\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81rya, notes are given herein.\n\n[244:1](tmu30.htm#fr_226) Comm.: Rising above the seven Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, one should\nwith introvision cognise in the region of \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81s, \xe1\xb9\xacamas and should then make\n\xe1\xb9\xacamas get into Rajas, Rajas into Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva, Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva into N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a and N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a,\ninto the Supreme One.\n\n[244:2](tmu30.htm#fr_227) \xe1\xb9\xac\xc4\x81raka is from tr., to cross, as it enables one to\ncross sams\xc4\x81ra.
