I have been helped\nmany times by my Master thru the power of Dharana Yoga, as once being lost in\nthe mountains, and again when there was no food or shelter, he sent me\ntelepathic messages directing me which way I should go, although he was\nhundreds of miles from the place where I was. The power of Dharana is the most\nwonderful of the [wondrous](errata.htm#8).\n\nOnce when sitting by the Master in a small town, a chicken-hawk swooped down\nupon a small chicken. The little fellow\n\np. 57\n\nfought for his life. The mother hen did all she could by fighting and\nsqualling, but that was not enough, the poor chicken was in the mouth of\ndeath. The Master looked up at the hawk once and the hawk and chicken came to\nearth. Then and there both were friendly, and remained in the company of each\nother for some time. It was a great joy for me to see a chicken and a hawk\nassociating together peacefully--it was indeed heavenly.\n\nAt sunset my Master once again looked upon the chicken and the hawk; lo, at\nonce the chicken ran to his mother, and the hawk flew in the air. That was all\ndone by the power of Samyama.\n\nWhat is Samyama and Dharana? It is of three kinds: gross, subtle and luminous.\nMastery of mind and [development](errata.htm#9) of will, What is will? Yogis\nknow will is power. It can do anything for you and will set you free. The\nMaster said: "By will man may become a Deva (like God), or the opposite." The\nBible says: "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he." The difference between\na human being and the Divine: man desires the God will, His will works. As\nlong as man\n\np. 58\n\ndesires, yet doubts his power, the doubt is the killer.\n\nMake up your mind. Stick with the will, that you can do a thing, and it is\nthen already half done. But when you doubt in yourself--that you can not, it\nwill never be done. You develop the will and become like Brahma.\n\nThe Yogis open the inner eye by Dharana, and by opening the inner eye nature\nbecomes like an open book. There is nothing hidden from them. They see their\ninner body as an ordinary man sees the outer body. They see how the different\nglands work; see the connection between the two bodies, the gross and the\nsubtle; see where the Chakras are, see, the five Pranas and know how to gather\nthem together to hold on one Chakra to open it. They know all.\n\nWhy do we not all see such things as the Yogis see? Because the Yogis have\ndeveloped their inner eye and have made their mind a great faculty.\n\nThis can be compared to the great telescope. As the great telescope reveals\nthe hidden secrets of the stars, so the inner eye of the Yogi reveals to him\nwhat he was, what is\n\np. 59\n\n[paragraph continues] God and where He is. Yogi found That (God) within\nhimself.\n\nNothing is hidden from God; so nothing from Yogi. The scientists and others\nmay call the Yogi whatever they wish, as very often Yogis are called fakes,\netc. The blame is not with the scientists or scoffers, but is due to their\nignorance, as they are ignorant of the blessed powers of the Yogi or the power\nthat is hidden within every one.\n\n________\n\nThe following excerpt from the "San Antonio Light", of Marcia 2,\n1930.--"American Magazine Section." This is a remarkable full page article,\nwith complete illustrations.\n\n"The distinguished New York nerve specialist, Dr. Frederick Tilney, declared\nin his recent book on the development of the human brain that this organ is\nstill used to only a small percentage of its real capacity. Dr. Constantin von\nEconomo, of Vienna, as distinguished in European neurology as is Dr. Tilney in\nthe United States, has stated this belief even more definitely.\n\n"Both these experts had chiefly in mind, their statements make clear, the\nintelligence of the human mind and its power to make correct judgments. They\nmight have said virtually the same things, however, about the power of the\nwill to control both mind and body.\n\n"For generations these powers of the will have been well knows in special\ninstances, like the fakirs of India or the religious fanatics who lie on beds\nof sharp spikes, who beat themselves in frenzy and yet feel no pain. Now\nscientific men are coming to the opinion that all human minds possess much\nthese same powers of developed will. All that is necessary is that the latent\npower of the mind be appreciated and applied.\n\nIn a recent hospital case the patient, not wishing to take as anesthetic,\nmerely went to sleep by will power, first telling the surgeon to go ahead.\nOther patients examined scientifically by the doctors turn out to have the\nability of stopping the heart bat temporarily or of interrupting the normal\npulse in the wrist, all by\n\np. 60\n\nthe power of the will. Sight, hearing, smell and other senses may be either\ndecreased or increased in sensitivity by will power. Determination, long\nsupposed to be a useful virtue only in some kind of contest, turns out to be\nas valuable in man\'s contest with his own body as anywhere else.\n\n"The Indian fakirs, long supposed by many people to be merely cheats and\nliars, but now recognized by scientific men as possessing unusual powers of\nmental control of the body, are still perhaps the best examples of what the\nwill can do to bodily machinery. Not long ago one of these fakirs, Tahra Bey,\ngave in London an exhibition to which numerous medical men were invited. Forty\nphysicians and scientists sat on the stage of the theatre where the exhibition\nwas given. All were permitted to examine the fakir during the demonstrations.\nTrickery was virtually impossible and experts agree that none was used.\n\n"Some of Tahra Bey\'s demonstrations were familiar ones of stage hypnotists.\nThrowing himself into a trance-like state, he made his body quite rigid. The\nstiff body was then laid on a series of sabres, not fully sharp but still\nedged enough to be uncomfortable. A large stone was laid on the fakir\'s rigid\nchest and was pounded with a sledge.\n\n"Brought out of his rigid condition, the fakir then thrust hat pins through\nhis cheeks, and through folds of flesh on chest and arms. A penknife similarly\nthrust through a fold of flesh produced a bleeding wound, or a bloodless one,\nwhichever the fakir suggested and announced in advance. Like his predecessors\nin India, Tahra Bey then lay down on a bed of six-inch nails driven point\nupward through a wooden door and reclined on this remarkable couch while an\nassistant weighing about 160 pounds stood for several minutes on the fakir\'s\nchest.\n\n"After this [demonstration](errata.htm#10) the fakir\'s back, examined by some\nof the physicians present, showed distinct marks of the points of the nails\nbut no blood was shed and the fakir claimed to feel no pain. That the hat\npoints and knives were actually thrust through the flesh and that some of\nthese wounds actually did not bleed as they would have done in normal bodies,\nwas also attested by the medical committee.\n\n"No claim was made by this particular fakir of anything supernatural in his\nperformance, nor is any such claim in the least justified. That anyone can\naccomplish very much the same feats with\n\np. 61\n\nsome training and a strong enough will is proved by the fact that many persons\nhave done so; notably a Parisian sceptic named Paul Heuze, who disbelieved the\nsupernatural claims of some of the earlier fakirs and managed, it is said,\nwith but one rehearsal, to duplicate the feats of lying on the bed of nails\nand of thrusting pins and knives into his flesh without causing pain or\ndrawing blood.\n\n"Last year there was prominent in Berlin a still more remarkable example of\nthis kind of bodily control by will power; a miner named Paul Diebel who\nsimilarly was able to thrust knives into his body, to cut himself without\nbleeding and even to allow arrows to be shot into his chest without apparent\nharm. One of Diebel\'s tricks which attracted great attention was an apparent\nability to bleed at will from his skin, as well as to prevent bleeding.\n\n"One theory held by physiologists is that the living cells which make up the\nnerves and which ordinarily are in contact with each other so that nerve\nmessages can pass, withdraw a little at their points of contact so that the\nnerve path is broken. The diagrams of the Hindu fakir on this page illustrate\nthe process. Apparently an effort of the will sometimes can accomplish this\nbreaking of the nerve circuits, much as can be done by drugs like cocaine,\nwhich are used as anesthetics. In both instances the nerve break means, that\nno messages of pain or other sensations can pass to the brain. Control of the\nwill over the flow of blood is equally well established by scientific\nevidence. Dr. A. S. Hyman, of New York City, has published accounts of three\npatients who were able by efforts of their will completely to stop the pulse\nin the wrist; the pulse which a physician usually feels when he wishes to\ncount the rate of the heartbeat. An East Indian physician, Dr. Vasant G. Rele,\nhas described similarly and at length the characteristics of an Indian holy\nman whose abilities In similar directions were examined by a committee of\nphysicians in Bombay.\n\n"This Yogi was able, the physicians found, to stop the pulse beat in either\narm for more than two minutes. The pulse in his temple on either side could be\nstopped similarly. Even the heart of this man stopped beating for six seconds\nby the physician\'s watch, when ordered to do so by the owner\'s will.\n\n"What happens in the case of the Yogis, fakirs and others who can control\nbleeding or pulse beats is, the scientists believe, that these nerves, not\nordinarily subject to control by the mind, are trained by long practice and\nefforts of the will to respond to voluntary orders.\n\np. 62\n\n[paragraph continues] Much the same thing happens when people train the\nmuscles of their scalps to obey orders from nerves now feeble and unused, so\nthat these people can move their ears a little as man\'s animal ancestors used\nto do.\n\n"Even life and death may be affected by the will. Major H. E. Smith, Assistant\nPolice Commissioner of the Gold Coast Colony, in Africa, recently reported an\ninstance in which a highly intelligent native willed himself to die as a\nresult of a quarrel and supposed witchcraft. Even on his body alter death\n[European](errata.htm#11) physicians could discover no reason\n[whatsoever](errata.htm#12) for death or even for illness.\n\n"But if a strong will can stop a fakir\'s heartbeat at will, make him bleed or\nnot bleed at will, certainly it can keep anybody from yielding to weakness or\ncrime."\n\n________\n\nHow do Yogis develop that power? I am sorry this cannot be explained in a\nbook. It can only be taught to those who are seeking truth, not to the\nfaithless. But I will explain as much as can be given in any book.\n\nFirst I will give the idea of Samyama from Katha [Upanishad](errata.htm#13):\n"The Wise should sink the Speech into Mind. Mind should sink into Intellect.\nIntellect should sink into Self. The Self should sink into the Great Self. The\nGreat Self should sink into Eternal Peace (Self-God).\n\nFirst. Lips should close, ears should open.\n\nSecond. Mind should stop wandering about.\n\nThird. Thoughts should he suppressed, the Intuition should be developed.\n\nFourth. Intuition should be suppressed\n\np. 63\n\nand Ego should be felt.\n\nFifth. Ego should be merged, blended into the Great Self.\n\nThe Great Self into Self Peace." (God--Universal Soul).\n\nThe above reference is to the practice of Yoga known as Samyama.\n\nWhat the Yogi gains by Samyama. "The direct perception gives the Yogi the\nright meaning, the inspiration gives him the word, the intuition gives him the\nright conclusion and discrimination saves him from error." The Yogi sees the\ntruth face to face.\n\nAny one can develop the above power by daily practice of Yoga. "But man can\nbecome aware of things which the senses can\'t grasp, Budhigrahyam atiudriyam\n(the reason or intellect) The proof of this you can get daily, when the Yogi\'s\npower is developed. This fact that man can see with his Budhi (intellect), the\ntruth about a thing he has never seen or known before, is enough to destroy\nthe materialistic idea of thought.\n\n"What is knowledge? In what does it consist? We must distinguish between\nknowledge in itself and the means of knowledge. Again, among the means we must\ndistinguish between the instruments and the\n\np. 64\n\noperations performed with the instruments.\n\n"By Knowledge we means awareness, taking a thing into active consciousness,\ninto our Chaitanyam. But when we say, taking it into our Chaitanyam. what do\nwe imply? Whence do we take it? The European says from outside, we say from\ninside, from Chaitanyam itself. In other words, all knowledge is an act of\n[consciousness](errata.htm#14) operating on something in the consciousness\nitself. In the first place everything we know exists in Parabrahma, that is,\nin our indivisible, universal self-existence. It is there, but not yet\nexpressed, not vyakta. Then it exists in pure Chit (the essential\nconsciousness of the Spirit), which is the womb of things as an idea of form,\nname and quality. It has name, form and quality in the Karana or Mahat, the\ncasual, typal and ideal state of consciousness. Then it gets the possibility\nof change, development or modification in the Sukshma, the subtle, mental or\nplastic state of consciousness. Finally it gets the actual change,\ndevelopment, modification or evolution in the Sthula, the material or\nevolutionary state of consciousness. In the Karana there is no evolution,\nnothing ever changes, all is eternal.\n\np. 65\n\n[paragraph continues] The Karana is Satyam. In the Sukshma all is preparation\nof change; it is full of imagination or anritam, therefore it is Swappa, not\nreally false, but not immediately applicable to the Karana or Sthula. In the\nSthula all evolves. It is partial sat-yam developing by the turning of old\nSatyam developing by the turning of old sattion, and the turning of new\nanritam into new satyam, which is called creation. In the satyam, which is\ncalled creation. In the Karana there is no creation, no birth, no death, all\nexists for ever--the only change is from type to type, from fulfilment to\nfulfilment.\n\n"Therefore to know is really to be conscious of the thing in any or all of\nthese three states. The knowledge of the Sthula is science. The knowledge of\nthe Sukshma is philosophy, religion and metaphysics. The knowledge of the\nKarana is Yoga. When a man knows the Sthula, he knows it with his senses, that\nis, with the Manas, he knows the Sukshma with reason of the inspired\nintellect, he knows the Karana with the Jnanam or spiritual realization.\nTherefore complete knowledge consists of three operations, first, objective\n\np. 66\n\n[paragraph continues] Upalabdhi or experience, secondly, intellectual\nstatement of your understanding of the thing, thirdly, subjective Upalabdhi or\n[spiritual](errata.htm#15) experience. The scientist begins from the bottom\nand climbs if he can, to the top. The Yogin begins from the top and descends\nfor perfect proof to the bottom. You are not scientists, you are sadhaks.\nTherefore, when you speak of knowledge you must understand the process; you\nrealise a thing by subjective experience, Bhava, then, think about it and\nformulate your experience in Artha and Vak, the combination which forms\nthought; you verify or test your experience by physical or objective\nexperience.\n\n"For instance you see a man. You want to know what he is, what he thinks and\nwhat he does. How does the scientist or the material man do it? He watches the\nman, he notes what he says, what are his expressions of speech and face. what\nare his actions, what sort of people he lives with, etc. All this is\nobjective. Then he reasons from his objective experience. He says--"The man\nsays this or that, so he must think so and so or he must have such and such a\ncharacter; his actions show the same," his face shows the same, and so he gees\non reasoning. If\n\np. 67\n\nhe dies not gets all the necessary facts, he fills them up from his\nimagination of from his memory, that is his experience of other men, of\nhimself or of human life as read of in books or heard of from other people. He\nperceives, he observes, contrasts, compares, deducts, infers, imagines,\nremembers and the composite result he calls reason, knowledge, fact. In\nreality he has arrived at a probability, for it is impossible for him to be\nsure that his conclusions are correct or anything indeed correct in his\nthought, except the actual observation, perceptions of his eye, ear, nose,\ntouch and taste. Anything beyond this the material man distrusts. Nothing is\ntrue to him except what he observes with his senses or what agrees with his\nsensory perceptions.\n\n"Now what does the Yogin do? He simply puts himself into relation with the\nthing itself. Not with its form, name or quality but with itself. He may never\nhave seen the form, heard the name or had experience of the quality, but still\nhe can know the thing. Because it is the thing itself and it is in himself and\none with himself, that is in the Mahakarana in a man. There all meet the Atman\nand are so entirely one with the Atman that by merely\n\np. 68\n\nbeing in contact with it, I can know everything about it. Few Yogins reach\nthat state. But all the same, even in the Karana I can put myself in relation\nwith the thing and know it by Bhava. I put myself, my soul, into relation with\nthe soul of the man I study or the thing I study; Prajna in me becomes one\nwith the Prajna in him or it. How do I do this? Simply by becoming passive and\nfacing him or it in my Buddhi. If my Buddhi is quite pure or fairly purified,\nif my Manas is shanta, then I get the truth about him. I get it by Bhava, by\nspiritual or subjective realization.\n\n"Then I have to make the thing I have got clear and precise. To do that I must\nstate it intellectually to my mind, that is. I must think about it. I have\nthese ideas I am telling you in myself as unexpressed knowledge; they shape\nthemselves in words, Vak, and take on a precise meaning, Artha. That is\nthought. Most people think vaguely; half expressing the thing in an imperfect\nVak and a partial Artha. The Yogin must not do that. His thoughts must express\nthemselves in clear and perfect sentences. He may know a thing without\nthinking it out, but if he thinks, he must think dearly and perfectly.\n\np. 69\n\n"The Yogin reasons when necessary, but not like the man of science. He sees\nthe thing with his prophetic power interpreting the truth into thought; the\npratyaksha gives him the Artha, the inspiration gives him the Vak, the\nintuition gives him to right conclusion about it, the right siddhanta, the\nViveka guards him from error. Behold the truth by these four simple operations\nperfectly thought out. If he has to argue, then the intuition gives him the\nright arguments. He has not to proceed painfully from one syllogism to another\nas the logician does.\n\n"Finally, he verifies his knowledge by the facts of the objective world. He\nhas seen the truth about the man by merely looking at him or at the idea of\nhim; he has thought it out clearly and now he compares his idea with the man\'s\naction, speech etc. Not to test his truth; for he knows that a man\'s action,\nspeech etc. only partially express the man and mislead the student; but in\norder to see how the truth he knows from the Karana is being worked out in the\nSthula. He trusts the man\'s objective life only so far as it is in agreement\nwith the deeper truth he has gained by Yoga.\n\n"You see the immense difference. The\n\np. 70\n\nonly difficulty is that you have been accustomed to use the senses and the\nreason to the subordination and almost to the exclusion of the higher\nfaculties. Therefore you find it difficult to make the higher faculties\nactive.\n\n"If only you could start from the beginning, with the Bhava, the Atmajnana,\nhow easy it would be! That will yet happen. But first, you have to get rid of\nthe lower Buddhi, of the Indriyas in the manas, and awaken the activity of the\nhigher faculties. They will see for you, hear for you, as well as think for\nyou.\n\nFirst, then, get your sankaras right. Understand intellectually what I have\ntold you and will yet tell you. Then by use of the Will, keep the reason,\nimagination, memory, thought, sensations sufficiently quiet for the higher\nBuddhi to know itself as separate and different from these lower qualities. As\nthe higher separates itself and becomes more and more active, the lower,\nalready discouraged, will become less and less active and finally trouble you\nno more.\n\nTherefore Will first, then by Will, by Shakti, the Jnanam. First Kali, then\nSurya.\n\np. 71\n\n[paragraph continues] I shall explain the various faculties when I have\nfinished with the rest of the system."\n\nFrom "Yogic Sadhan"\n\nBy Master Arabinda Ghose.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Samadhi Yoga](kmu10.htm)\n\n'
