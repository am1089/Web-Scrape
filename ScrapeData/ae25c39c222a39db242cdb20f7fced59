COURTS OF JUSTICE.\n\n* 1. 1 One who has not been authorized must not speak on any account at the trial. But authorized persons must deliver their opinion in an unbiassed spirit.\n\n* 2. 2 Whether unauthorized or authorized, one acquainted with the law shall give his opinion. He passes a divine sentence who acts up to the dictates of law.\n\n3. 3 If he delivers a fair opinion, a member of the court will incur neither hatred nor sin. But if he speaks otherwise he at once incurs both.\n\n* 4. 4 Let the king appoint, as members of a court\n\np. 37\n\nof justice, honourable men, of tried integrity, who are able to bear, like\ngood bulls, the burden of the administration of justice.\n\n* 5. 5 The members of a royal court of justice must be acquainted with the sacred law and with rules of prudence, noble, veracious, and impartial towards friend and foe.\n\n6. 6 Justice is said to depend on them, and the king is the fountain head of justice. Therefore the king should try causes properly, attended by good assessors.\n\n7. 7 When lawsuits are decided properly, the members of the court are cleared from guilt. Their purity depends on the justice (of the sentences passed by them). Therefore one must deliver a fair judgment.\n\n8. 8 Where justice is slain by injustice, and truth by falsehood, the members of the court, who look on with indifference, are doomed to destruction themselves.\n\np. 38\n\n9. 9 Where justice, having been hit by injustice, enters a court of justice, and the members of the court do not extract the dart from the wound, they are hit by it themselves.\n\n10. 10 Either the judicial assembly must not be entered at all, or a fair opinion delivered. That man who either stands mute or delivers an opinion contrary to justice is a sinner.\n\n11. 11 Those members of a court who, after having entered it, sit mute and meditative, and do not speak when the occasion arises, are liars all of them.\n\n* 12. 12 One quarter of the iniquity goes to the offender; one quarter goes to the witness; one quarter goes to all the members of the court; one quarter goes to the king.\n\n13\\. The king is freed from responsibility, the\n\np. 39\n\nmembers of the court obtain their absolution, and the guilt goes to the\noffender, when the guilty person is punished.\n\n14. 14 He who, having entered the court, delivers a strange opinion, ignoring the true state of the case, resembles a blind man who regardless swallows fish together with the bones.\n\n15. 15 Therefore let every assessor of the court deliver a fair opinion after having entered the court, discarding love and hatred, in order that he may not go to hell.\n\n* 16 16. As an experienced surgeon extracts a dart by means of surgical instruments, even so the chief\n\np. 40\n\njudge must extract the dart (of iniquity) from the lawsuit.\n\n* 17. 17 When the whole aggregate of the members of a judicial assembly declare, 'This is right,' the lawsuit loses the dart, otherwise the dart remains in it.\n\n18. 18 That is not a judicial assembly where there are no elders. They are not elders who do not pass a just sentence. That is not a just sentence in which there is no truth. That is not truth which is vitiated by error.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[36:1](sbe3307.htm#fr_106) III, 1. Courts of justice are generally thronged by\na large attendance. Some of the persons present are intelligent, others are\nnot, and others are wise in their own estimation only. Such persons, if\nunrestrained, would disturb the judges by interpreting idle speeches between\nthe legal proceedings, and by quarrelling amongst themselves. Therefore, the\nfirst half of this paragraph relates to the punishment ordained for those who\nspeak without authorization. Authorized persons, i.e. the judges who sit on\nthe seat of judgment, shall strive to be just, i.e. they shall deliver a\njudgment in accordance with justice, and shall not show partiality for either\nof the parties. A.\n\n[36:2](sbe3307.htm#fr_107) Where all the assessors of the court pass an unjust\nsentence, from ignorance of the law, or from interested motives, there a\nBrahman versed in the sacred law and acquainted with legal proceedings, who\nhappens to be present, shall point out the law to them, and restrain the\njudges from their sinful course. He shall speak, though he has not been\nappointed to deliver judgment. Law is called the voice of the deity. A.\n\n[36:3](sbe3307.htm#fr_108) That is called 'a fair opinion' which is not\ncontrary to written law and to custom. A judge who delivers a sentence of this\nkind incurs neither enmity nor sin, i.e. he does not become unhappy either in\nthis world or in the next. A.\n\n[36:4](sbe3307.htm#fr_109) As young bulls are able to carry a heavy burden,\neven so p. 37 competent judges are able to discharge the onerous duties of\ntheir responsible office. They must be men of ripe wisdom, acquainted with\nsacred law and with the ways of the world, and the king must have tested their\nqualifications. A. Vish _n_ u III, 74, &c.\n\n[37:5](sbe3307.htm#fr_110) The law-books contain many utterances of the sages,\nwhich are obscure and difficult to make out. Therefore slow-minded persons,\nwho are unable to understand them, and to refer their contents to each case in\nhand, must not be appointed. Well-descended persons shall be appointed,\nbecause they will avoid partiality from family pride. 'Veracious' persons have\na natural abhorrence against untruthfulness. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 2.\n\n[37:6](sbe3307.htm#fr_111) 'On them,' i.e. on the judges, whose qualities have\nbeen previously described. A. Vish _n_ u III, 72; Manu VIII, 1; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya II, 1, &c.\n\n[37:7](sbe3307.htm#fr_112) If the king decides lawsuits justly, the assessors\nobtain their own absolution through the just decision. A.\n\n[37:8](sbe3307.htm#fr_113) Identical with Manu VIII, 14.\n\n[38:9](sbe3307.htm#fr_114) Virtue is here compared to one wounded with a\nweapon, who goes to a physician in order to be cured by him. The judges are\ncompared to physicians who, by means of a careful judicial investigation,\ndeliver justice from the attacks of iniquity. If they do not extract the dart\nof iniquity, they are killed themselves by the dart of iniquity, which has\nbeen spared by them. A. Nearly identical with Manu VIII, 12.\n\n[38:10](sbe3307.htm#fr_115) Either the judicial assembly must not be entered\nat all, not even a single time, or an opinion conformable to justice must be\ndelivered. A judge who remains silent, or who, when asked to pass a sentence,\nsays what is contrary to justice, is criminal, i.e. a great sinner. A. Nearly\nidentical with Manu VIII, 13.\n\n[38:11](sbe3307.htm#fr_116) Those judges who sit mute in the judicial\nassembly, being apparently engaged in meditating over an altogether different\naffair than that for which the parties have appeared before the tribunal, and\nwho fail to declare at the proper time the victory of the one party and the\ndefeat of the other, all such persons shall be looked upon by the king as\nequally criminal with those who pass a false sentence. A.\n\n[38:12](sbe3307.htm#fr_117) 12, 13. These two paragraphs belong together. If\nthe judges, p. 39 were to acquit the criminal, and unjustly to condemn the\ninnocent party, the iniquity or sinful action committed by the unjust decree\nwould go into four parts, i.e. a quarter of it would go respectively to the\nshares of the perpetrator of the deed, of the witnesses, of all the assessors\nof the court, and of the king. If, however, the guilty person alone is\ncondemned, i.e. if the criminal party loses his cause, the king becomes free\nfrom guilt, the judges are free from responsibility, and the whole guilt falls\non the perpetrator of the iniquitous deed. A. Medhatithi, in commenting on the\nidentical rule of Manu (VIII, 18), observes that the guilt goes to the king,\nin case the sentence had been passed by him in person. Otherwise it goes to\nhis chief judge. Identical with Manu VIII, 18, 19, &c.\n\n[39:14](sbe3307.htm#fr_118) One whose eyesight is unimpaired, does not eat\nfish without having previously removed the bones, which would injure his\nmouth, his tongue, and his palate. A blind man, on the contrary, eats fish\ntogether with the bones, because he is unable to remove them. The case is\nsimilar with the eye of knowledge. A.\n\n[39:15](sbe3307.htm#fr_119) Considering all this, let a judge, after having\nentered the court of judicature, reject every kind of bias, and deliver a\nfair, i.e. an impartial opinion, in order that he may not go to hell burdened\nwith the crime of a guilty person (acquitted by him). A.\n\n[39:16](sbe3307.htm#fr_120) As a skilful surgeon conversant with the art of\nextracting a dart, extracts it, though it may be difficult to get at and\ninvisible, by the application of surgical instruments, of spells, and other\nmanifold artful practices, even so a judge shall extract the dart of p. 40\niniquity which has entered a lawsuit, by employing the artful expedients of\njudicial investigation. A.\n\n[40:17](sbe3307.htm#fr_121) 'The members of a judicial assembly' are those who\nhave come together for the trial of a cause. A.\n\n[40:18](sbe3307.htm#fr_122) This paragraph, in the original, is a verse\ncomposed in the Trish _t_ ubh metre, and has the look of an old versus\nmemorialis. Though the author of the Narada-sm _ri_ ti has incorporated it in\nhis work, its contents do not quite fit in with his own ideas regarding the\nconstitution of a judicial assembly, and the prominent place which he assigns\nto the chief judge of the king.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 1.
