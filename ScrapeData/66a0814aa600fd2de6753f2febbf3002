I will give an account now how\nShree [Krishnu](errata.htm#5) Chund brought Brindabun to mind; listen\nattentively. One day Huri said to Bulram Jee, "Brother! all the inhabitants of\nBrindabun must be very much grieved on thinking of me, because the time has\nelapsed, in which I promised to return. We ought therefore, to send some one\nthere, to console them for my absence."\n\nHaving thus advised his brother, Huri sent for Oodho, and said to him, "Oodho!\nyou are a great friend of mine; and are wise and intelligent, and resolute. I\ntherefore wish to send you to Brindabun to offer explanations and consolation\nto Nund and Jusodha, and the cowherdesses, and to bring my mother Rohnee\nhere." Oodho expressed an immediate readiness to comply with this request.\nShree Krishnu Chund again said, "First of all, inform Nund and Jusodha, and\ncheer up their spirits, and suggest to them to abandon all grief, and to look\nupon my arrival as near at hand; and not to regard me as their son, but\nworship me as a deity. Afterwards explain to those cowherdesses, who for my\nsake have given up all respect for the world and for the Vedas, and day and\nnight sing of my sports, and are ready to die, if I do not fulfil their\nexpectation of my returning, that they must no longer consider\n\np. 173\n\nme as their lord, but worship me as Bhugwan, and lay aside all the anxiety\nthey now suffer in consequence of my separation from them."\n\nO great king! having thus instructed Oodho, the two brothers wrote a letter,\nin which they expressed to Nund and Jusodha, and the cowherds and their\nchildren their respects and compliments, and blessing in due form: and advised\nall the women of Bruj to perform penance, and delivered the letter to Oodho,\nand told him to read it to them; and after having made the necessary\nexplanations to return quickly. Having given him this message, Krishnu dressed\nOodho in his own clothes, and gave him his own jewels and crown, and seating\nhim on his own ruth, allowed him to depart to Brindabun. Proceeding on his\njourney, Oodho reached the neighbourhood of Brindabun after a short time, and\non arrival there, heard birds singing melodiously in the thickly stocked\narbours, and cows of all colours, scattered like clouds in every direction-and\nthe cowherdesses and cowherds, with their children, singing the praises of\nShree Krishnu.\n\nHe was delighted at the beauty of the scene, and making obeisance to the site\nof Krishnu\'s sports, arrived at the outskirts of the village, when some one\nhaving recognized the ruth of Huri from a distance came and having enquired\nhis name, went to Nund and said, "O great king! a person, named Oodho, has\narrived from Muttra, in the appearance and ruth of Shree Krishnu."\n\nOn hearing these words Nund Rae came forth from amidst the assembly of the\ncowherds, where he was then sitting, and immediately approached Oodho.\nRegarding him as the companion of Bulram and Krishnu, he embraced him with the\ngreatest affection; and enquiring kindly of his health and welfare, escorted\nhim to his house with great dignity and respect; having caused his feet to be\nwashed, he offered him a seat, and feasted Oodho with delicacies of all kinds;\nwhen Oodho had enjoyed and finished his meal, Nund had an elegant couch\n\np. 174\n\nprepared for him, shining like the foam of the sea, on which, after eating\npawn, he reclined most agreeably, and forgot all the fatigues of his journey.\n\nWhen after some time, Oodho awoke, Nund, the chief, came and sat near him, and\nenquired after his son, Soorsen, and his great friend, Basoodeo and his\nfamily, and asked whether they still continued to love him Nund added, "Give\nme news of my son, with whom you have abode constantly. Does he ever think of\nme, who am greatly grieved at his absence? He promised us all to return, but\nthe time of his return has long elapsed. Jusodha constantly churns and makes\nbutter for Krishnu, and places it apart for him. Does Krishnu ever think of\nher and the women of Bruj, who are deeply imbued with love and affection for\nhim?"\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja Pureechit,--O lord of the earth! in this manner enquiring the news and\ncelebrating the former sports of Shree Krishnu Chund, Nund Rae Jee, being\ndeeply impregnated with affection for Krishnu, and meditating upon him, became\nsilent--"He has destroyed Kuns, and other powerful men; why should Krishnu now\nforget us?"\n\nIn the mean while the Ranee Jusodha, greatly agitated, and losing all sense\nand perception, came weeping bitterly to Oodho and enquiring after Bulram and\nKrishnu said, "Tell me, Oodho Jee! how has Huri passed his time so long\nwithout us, and what message has he sent us, and when will he return to us?"\nOn hearing these words Oodho Jee read the letter of Shree Krishnu and Bulram\nto Nund and Jusodha, and said, "Who can explain the greatness of those, in\nwhose house Bhugwan has been born, and whom he has made happy by his sports?\nYou are most fortunate, because how can the immortal Vishnu, the lord of Shivu\nand Bruhmu, who has neither mother, nor father, nor brother nor relations,\nwhom you look upon as your own son, and constantly fix your thoughts and\nmeditate upon, remain separated from you? Huri is constantly near those who\n\np. 175\n\nlove him; having assumed mortal shape for the sake of men, he has neither\nfriends nor enemies, whether of high or low estate. Whoever offers adoration\nand worship to Huri, will be united to him, and become a follower of his. As\nthe large black bee carries off another insect, and moulds it to its own form,\nand as it remains enclosed in the flower of the lotus, and does not leave it\nand fly away, although other bees buz over it during the whole night: in like\nmanner Huri fashions after his own model, and never abandons those who love\nhim, and meditate upon him." Oodho added, "Do not any longer regard Huri as\nyour son, but reverence him as the deity. Krishnu, the lord, who knows the\nsecrets of the heart, and befriends his worshippers, will appear and come to\nyou, and accomplish all your desires: be not at all anxious in your minds."\n\nO great king! when in conversation of this kind the whole night, with\nexception of about an hour, was spent, Oodho Jee said to Nund Rae, "O great\nking! it is now time for churning: with your permission, I will go and bathe\nin the Jumna." Nund, the chief, gave his assent; he remained seated where he\nwas, engaged in thought and reflection, and Oodho Jee went in his ruth to the\nbanks of the Jumna. Having taken off his clothes, and purified himself, he\napproached the water, and placing dust on his head, and joining his hands,\nsinging the praises of the Jumna, sipping water in the palm of his hand, he\nwent into the river; and having bathed, and performed his ablutions, and\ncompleted his meditations, adorations and libations, began to count his beads.\nAt the same time, all the women of Bruj rose, and having swept and besmeared\nwith mud and cow-dung, the inside of their houses, and having burnt perfumes\nand lighted lamps, began to churn. The sound of the churning was like thunder,\nand like the sound produced by anklets and ornaments for the toes. The\nbeautiful women of Bruj, having churned took away the butter, and finished\ntheir household work, went all together for water.\n\np. 176\n\nO great king! the cowherdesses being distracted at separation from Krishnu,\nand deeply imbued with love for him, and celebrating his many excellent\nqualities with songs, began, as they went along the road, to meditate upon\nhim, and sing of his sports. One said, "I have seen Krishnu;" another, "That\nhe had run off and hid himself. He has laid hold of my arm from behind: Huri\nis now standing under the shade of a fig tree." One remarked, "I saw him\nmilking:" another, "I beheld him very early." Some said, "He is tending herds;\nothers, "Listen! he is playing the flute. We will not go this road, as Krishnu\nwill ask for presents. He will break our water pots, and untie the knots, on\nwhich we carry them; and will steal away our senses by his many glances. He is\nhid somewhere, and will come running towards us; and then where shall we\nescape." The women of Bruj went along, conversing thus with each other; their\nminds being much agitated in consequence of their separation from Krishnu.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XLVIII](psa49.htm)\n\n'
