 \nIts lotus petals bright and sweet  \nRained down about the giant's feet.  \nHer vesture, bright as burning gold,  \nGave to the wind each glittering fold,  \nFair as a gilded cloud that gleams  \nTouched by the Day-God's tempered beams.  \nYet struggling in the fiend's embrace,  \nThe lady with her sweet pure face,  \nFar from her lord, no longer wore  \nThe light of joy that shone before.  \nLike some sad lily by the side  \nOf waters which the sun has dried;  \nLike the pale moon uprising through  \nAn autumn cloud of darkest hue,  \nSo was her perfect face between  \nThe arms of giant Ravan seen:  \nFair with the charm of braided tress  \nAnd forehead's finished loveliness;  \nFair with the ivory teeth that shed  \nWhite lustre through the lips' fine red,  \nFair as the lotus when the bud  \nIs rising from the parent flood.  \nWith faultless lip and nose and eye.  \nDear as the moon that floods the sky  \nWith gentle light, of perfect mould,  \nShe seemed a thing of burnished gold,  \n\nThough on her cheek the traces lay  \nOf tears her hand had brushed away,  \nBut as the moon-beams swiftly fade  \nEre the great Day-God shines displayed,  \nSo in that form of perfect grace  \nStill trembling in the fiend's embrace,  \nFrom her beloved Rama reft,  \nNo light of pride or joy was left.  \nThe lady with her golden hue  \nO'er the swart fiend a lustre threw,  \nAs when embroidered girths enfold  \nAn elephant with gleams of gold.  \nFair as the lily's bending stem  \nHer arms adorned with many a gem,  \nA lustre to the fiend she lent  \nGleaming from every ornament,  \nAs when the cloud-shot flashes light  \nThe shadows of a mountain height.  \nWhene'er the breezes earthward bore  \nThe tinkling of the zone she wore,  \nHe seemed a cloud of darkness hue  \nSending forth murmurs as it flew.  \nAs on her way the dame was sped  \nFrom her sweet neck fair flowers were shed,  \nThe swift wind caught the flowery rain  \nAnd poured it o'er the fiend again.  \nThe wind-stirred blossoms, sweet to smell,  \nOn the dark brows of Ravan fell,  \nLike lunar constellations set  \nOn Meru for a coronet.  \nFrom her small foot an anklet fair  \nWith jewels slipped, and through the air,  \nLike a bright circlet of the flame  \nOf thunder, to the valley came.  \nThe Maithil lady, fair to see  \nAs the young leaflet of a tree  \nClad in the tender hues of spring,  \nFlashed glory on the giant king,  \nAs when a gold-embroidered zone  \nAround an elephant is thrown.  \nWhile, bearing far the lady, through  \nThe realms of sky the giant flew,  \nShe like a gleaming meteor cast  \nA glory round her as she passed.  \nThen from each limb in swift descent  \nDropped many a sparkling ornament:  \nOn earth they rested dim and pale  \nLike fallen stars when virtues fail. 1  \nAround her neck a garland lay  \nBright as the Star-God's silvery ray:  \nIt fell and flashed like Ganga sent  \nFrom heaven above the firmament. 2  \nThe birds of every wing had flocked  \nTo stately trees by breezes rocked:  \n\np. 292  \n\nThese bowed their wind-swept heads and  \nsaid:  \n'My lady sweet, be comforted.'  \nWith faded blooms each brook within  \nWhose waters moved no gleamy fin,  \nStole sadly through the forest dell  \nMourning the dame it loved so well.  \nFrom every woodland region near  \nCame lions, tigers, birds, and deer,  \nAnd followed, each with furious look,  \nThe way her flying shadow took.  \nFor Sita's loss each lofty hill  \nWhose tears were waterfall, and rill,  \nLifting on high each arm-like steep,  \nSeemed in the general woe to weep.  \nWhen the great sun, the lord of day,  \nSaw Ravan tear the dame away,  \nHis glorious light began to fail  \nAnd all his disk grew cold and pale.  \n'If Ravan from the forest hies**  \nWith Rama's Sita as his prize,  \nJustice and truth have vanished hence,  \nHonour and right and innocence.'  \nThus rose the cry of wild despair  \nFrom spirits as they gathered there.  \nIn trembling troops in open lawns  \nWept, wild with woe, the startled fawns,  \nAnd a strange terror changed the eyes  \nThey lifted to the distant skies.  \nOn silvan Gods who love the dell  \nA sudden fear and trembling fell,  \nAs in the deepest woe they viewed  \nThe lady by the fiend subdued.  \nStill in loud shrieks was heard afar  \nThat voice whose sweetness naught could  \nmar,  \nWhile eager looks of fear and woe  \nShe bent upon the earth below.  \nThe lady of each winning wile  \nWith pearly teeth and lovely smile,  \nSeized by the lord of Lanka's isle,  \n   Looked down for friends in vain.  \nShe saw no friend to aid her, none,  \nNot Rama nor the younger son  \nOf Das'aratha, and undone  \n   She swooned with fear and pain.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[291:1](ry250.htm#fr_505) The spirits of the good dwell in heaven until their\nstore of accumulated merit is exhausted.
