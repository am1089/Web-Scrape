This was a great grief to him, especially when he remembered that on\nhis death there would be no heir to inherit the kingdom.\n\nNow it happened one day that a poor old fakir came to the King, and said,\n"Your prayers are heard, your desire shall be accomplished, and one of your\nseven Queens shall bear a son."\n\nThe King\'s delight at this promise knew no bounds, and he gave orders for\nappropriate festivities to be prepared against the coming event throughout the\nlength and breadth of the land.\n\nMeanwhile the seven Queens lived luxuriously in a splendid palace, attended by\nhundreds of female slaves, and fed to their hearts\', content on sweetmeats and\nconfectionery.\n\nNow the King was very fond of hunting, and one day, before he started, the\nseven Queens sent him a message saying, "May it please our dearest lord not to\nhunt towards the north to-day, for we have dreamt bad dreams, and fear lest\nevil should befall you."\n\nThe King, to allay their anxiety, promised regard for their wishes, and set\nout towards the south; but as luck would have it, although he hunted\ndiligently, he found no game. Nor had he more success to the east or west, so\nthat, being a keen sportsman, and determined not to go home empty-handed, he\nforgot all about his promise, and turned to the north. Here also he was at\nfirst unsuccessful, but just as he had made up his mind to give up for that\nday, a white hind with golden horns and silver hoofs flashed past him into a\nthicket. So quickly did it pass that he scarcely saw it; nevertheless a\nburning desire to capture. and possess the beautiful strange creature filled\nhis breast. He instantly ordered his attendants to form a ring round the\nthicket, and so encircle the hind; then, gradually narrowing the circle, he\npressed forward till he could distinctly see the white hind panting in the\nmidst. Nearer and nearer he advanced, till, just as he thought to lay hold of\nthe beautiful strange creature, it gave one mighty bound, leapt clean over the\nKing\'s head, and fled towards the mountains. Forgetful of all else, the King,\nsetting spurs to his horse, followed at full speed. On, on he galloped,\nleaving his retinue far behind, keeping the white hind in view, never drawing\nbridle, until, finding himself in a narrow ravine with no outlet, he reined in\nhis steed. Before him stood a miserable hovel; into which, being tired after\nhis long, unsuccessful chase, he entered to ask for a drink of water. An old\nwoman, seated in the hut at a spinning-wheel, answered his request by calling\nto her daughter, and immediately from an inner room came a maiden so lovely\nand charming, so white-skinned and golden-haired, that the King was transfixed\nby astonishment at seeing so beautiful a sight in the wretched hovel.\n\n[![](tn/46.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/46.jpg)\n\nShe held the vessel of water to the King\'s lips, and as he drank he looked\ninto her eyes, and then it became clear to him that the girl was no other than\nthe white hind with the golden horns and silver feet he had chased so far.\n\nHer beauty bewitched him, so he fell on his knees, begging her to return with\nhim as his bride; but she only laughed, saying seven Queens were quite enough\neven for a King to manage. However, when he would take no refusal, but\nimplored her to have pity on him, promising her everything she could desire,\nshe replied "Give me the eyes of your seven Queens, and then perhaps I may\nbelieve you mean what you say."\n\nThe King was so carried away by the glamour of the white hind\'s magical\nbeauty, that he went home at once, had the eyes of his seven Queens taken out,\nand, after throwing the poor blind creatures into a noisome dungeon whence\nthey could not escape, set off once more for the hovel in the ravine; bearing\nwith him his horrible offering. But the white hind only . laughed cruelly when\nshe saw the fourteen eyes, and threading them as a necklace, flung it round\nher mother\'s neck, saying, "Wear that, little mother, as a keepsake, whilst I\nam away in the King\'s palace."\n\nThen she went back with, the bewitched monarch, as his bride, and he gave her\nthe seven Queens\' rich clothes and jewels to wear, the seven Queens\' palace to\nlive in, and the seven Queens\' slaves to wait upon her; so that she really had\neverything even a witch could desire.\n\nNow, very soon after the seven wretched hapless Queens had their eyes torn\nout, and were cast into prison, a baby was born to the youngest of the Queens.\nIt was a handsome boy, but the other Queens were very jealous that the\nyoungest amongst them should be so fortunate. But though at first they\ndisliked the handsome little boy, he soon proved so useful to them, that ere\nlong they all looked on him as their son. Almost as soon as he could walk\nabout he began scraping at the mud wall of their dungeon, and in an incredibly\nshort space of time had made a hole big enough for him to crawl through.\nThrough this he disappeared, returning in an hour or so laden with sweetmeats,\nwhich he divided equally amongst the seven blind Queens.\n\nAs he grew older he enlarged the hole, and slipped out two or three times\nevery day to play with the little nobles in, the town. No one knew who the\ntiny boy was, but everybody liked him, and he was so full of funny tricks and\nantics, so merry and bright, that he was sure to be rewarded by some girdle-\ncakes, a handful of parched grain, or some sweetmeats. All these things he\nbrought home to his seven mothers, as he loved to call the seven blind Queens,\nwho by his help lived on in their dungeon when all the world thought they had\nstarved to death ages before.\n\nAt last, when he was quite a big lad, he one day took his bow and arrow, and\nwent out to seek for game. Coming by chance past the palace where the white\nhind lived in wicked splendour and magnificence, he saw some pigeons\nfluttering round the white marble turrets, and, taking good aim, shot one\ndead. It came tumbling past the very window where the white Queen was sitting;\nshe rose to see what was the matter, and looked out. At the first glance of\nthe handsome young lad standing there bow in hand, she knew by witchcraft that\nit was the King\'s son.\n\nShe nearly died of envy and spite, determining to destroy the lad without\ndelay; therefore, sending a servant to bring him to her presence, she asked\nhim if he would sell her the pigeon he had just shot.\n\n"No," replied the sturdy lad, "the pigeon is for my seven blind mothers, who\nlive in the noisome dungeon, and who would die if I did not bring them food."\n\n"Poor souls!" cried the cunning white witch; "would you not like to bring them\ntheir eyes again? Give me the pigeon, my dear, and I faithfully promise to\nshow you where to find them."\n\nHearing this, the lad was delighted beyond measure, and gave up the pigeon at\nonce. Whereupon the white Queen told him to seek her mother without delay, and\nask for the eyes which she wore as a necklace.\n\n"She will not fail to give them," said the cruel Queen, "if you show her this\ntoken on which I have written what I want done."\n\nSo saying, she gave the lad a piece of broken potsherd, with these words\ninscribed on it--" Kill the bearer at once, and sprinkle his blood like\nwater!"\n\nNow, as the son of seven Queens could not read, he took the fatal message\ncheerfully, and set off to find the white Queen\'s mother.\n\nWhilst he was journeying he passed through a town, where every one of the\ninhabitants looked so sad, that he could not help asking what was the matter.\nThey told him it was because the King\'s only daughter refused to marry;\nso,when her father died there would be no heir to the throne. They greatly\nfeared she must be out of her mind, for though every good-looking young man in\nthe kingdom had been shown to her, she declared she would only marry one who\nwas the son of seven mothers, and who ever heard of such a thing? The King, in\ndespair, had ordered every man who entered the city gates to be led before the\nPrincess; so, much to the lad\'s impatience, for he was in an immense hurry to\nfind his mothers\' eyes, he was dragged into the presence -chamber.\n\nNo sooner did the Princess catch sight of him than she blushed, and, turning\nto the King, said, "Dear father, this is my choice!"\n\nNever were such rejoicings as these few words produced.\n\nThe inhabitants nearly went wild with joy, but the son of seven Queens said he\nwould not marry the Princess unless they first let him recover his mothers\'\neyes. When the beautiful bride heard his story, she asked to see the potsherd,\nfor she was very learned and clever. Seeing the treacherous words, she said\nnothing, but taking another similar-shaped bit of potsherd, she wrote on it\nthese words--" Take care of this lad, giving him all he desires," and returned\nit to the son of seven Queens, who, none the wiser, set off on his quest.\n\nEre long he arrived at the hovel in the ravine where the white witch\'s mother,\na hideous old creature, grumbled dreadfully on reading the message, especially\nwhen the lad asked for the necklace of eyes. Nevertheless she took it off, and\ngave it him, saying, "there are only thirteen of \'em now, for I lost one last\nweek."\n\nThe lad, however, was only too glad to get any at all, so he hurried home as\nfast as he could to his seven mothers, and gave two eyes apiece to the six\nelder Queens; but to the youngest he gave one, saying, "Dearest little mother!\n--I will be your other eye always!"\n\nAfter this be set off to marry the Princess, as he had promised, but when\npassing by the white Queen\'s palace he saw some pigeons on the roof. Drawing\nhis bow, he shot one, and it came fluttering past the window. The white hind\nlooked out, and lo! there was the King\'s son alive and well.\n\n[![](tn/47.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/47.jpg)\n\nShe cried with hatred and disgust, but sending for the lad, asked him how he\nhad returned so soon, and when she heard how he had brought home the thirteen\neyes, and given them to the seven blind Queens, she could hardly restrain her\nrage. Nevertheless she pretended to be charmed with his success, and told him\nthat if he would give her this pigeon also, she would reward him with the\nJogi\'s wonderful cow, whose milk flows all day long, and makes a pond as big\nas a kingdom. The lad, nothing loth, gave her the pigeon; whereupon, as\nbefore, she bade him go ask her mother for the cow, and gave him a potsherd\nwhereon was written--"Kill this lad without fail, and sprinkle his blood like\nwater!"\n\nBut on the way the son of seven Queens looked in on the Princess, just to tell\nher how he came to be delayed, and she, after reading the message on the\npotsherd, gave him another in its stead; so that when the lad reached the old\nhag\'s hut and asked her for the Jogi\'s cow, she could not refuse, but told the\nboy how to find it; and bidding him of all things not to be afraid of the\neighteen thousand demons who kept watch and ward over the treasure, told him\nto be off before she became too angry at her daughter\'s foolishness in thus\ngiving away so many good things.\n\nThen the lad did as he had been told bravely. He journeyed on and on till he\ncame to a milk-white pond, guarded by the eighteen thousand demons. They were\nreally frightful to behold, but, plucking up courage, he whistled a tune as he\nwalked through them, looking neither to the right nor the left. By-and-by he\ncame upon the Jogi\'s cow, tall, white, and beautiful, while the Jogi himself,\nwho was king of all the demons, sat milking her day and night, and the milk\nstreamed, from her udder, filling the milk-white tank.\n\nThe Jogi, seeing the lad, called out fiercely, "What do you want here?"\n\nThen the lad answered, according to the old hag\'s bidding,\n\n"I want your skin, for King Indra is making a new kettledrum, and says your\nskin is nice and tough."\n\nUpon this the Jogi began to shiver and shake (for no Jinn or Jogi dares\ndisobey King Indra\'s command), and, falling at the lad\'s feet, cried, "If you\nwill spare me I will give you anything I possess, even my beautiful white\ncow!"\n\nTo this the son of seven Queens, after a little pretended hesitation, agreed,\nsaying that after all it would not be difficult to find a nice tough skin like\nthe Jogi\'s elsewhere; so, driving the wonderful cow before him, he set off\nhomewards. The seven Queens were delighted to possess so marvellous an animal,\nand though they toiled from morning till night making curds and whey, besides\nselling milk to the confectioners, they could not use half the cow gave, and\nbecame richer and richer day by day.\n\nSeeing them so comfortably off, the son of seven Queens started with a light\nheart to marry the Princess; but when passing the white hind\'s palace he could\nnot resist sending a bolt at some pigeons which were cooing on the parapet.\nOne fell dead just beneath the window where the white Queen was sitting.\nLooking out, she saw the lad hale and hearty standing before her, and grew\nwhiter than ever with rage and spite.\n\nShe sent for him to ask how he had returned so soon, and when she heard how\nkindly her mother had received him, the very nearly had a fit; however, she\ndissembled her feelings as well as she could, and, smiling sweetly, said she\nwas glad to have been able to fulfil her promise, and that if he would give\nher this third pigeon, she would do yet more for him than she, had done\nbefore, by giving him the million-fold rice, which ripens in one night.\n\nThe lad was of course delighted at the very idea, and, giving up the pigeon,\nset off on his quest, armed as before with a potsherd, on which was written,\n"Do not fail this time. Kill the lad, and sprinkle his blood like water!"\n\nBut when he looked in on his Princess, just to prevent her becoming anxious\nabout him, she asked to see the potsherd as usual, and substituted another, on\nwhich was written, "Yet again give this lad all he requires, for his blood\nshall be as your blood!"\n\n[![](tn/48.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/48.jpg)\n\nNow when the old hag saw this, and heard how the lad wanted the million-fold\nrice which ripens in a single night, she fell into the most furious rage, but\nbeing terribly afraid of her daughter, she controlled herself, and bade the\nboy go and find the field guarded by eighteen millions of demons, warning him\non no account to look back after having plucked the tallest spike of rice,\nwhich grew in the centre.\n\nSo the son of seven Queens set off, and soon came to the field where, guarded\nby eighteen millions of demons, the million-fold rice grew. He walked on\nbravely, looking neither to the right or left, till he reached the centre and\nplucked the tallest ear, but as he turned homewards a thousand sweet voices\nrose behind him, crying in tenderest accents, "Pluck me too! oh, please pluck\nme too!" He looked back, and lo! there was nothing left of him but a little\nheap of ashes!\n\nNow as time passed by and the lad did not return, the old hag grew uneasy,\nremembering the message "his blood shall be as your blood;" so she set off to\nsee what had happened.\n\nSoon she came to the heap of ashes, and knowing by her arts what it was, she\ntook a little water, and kneading the ashes into a paste, formed it into the\nlikeness of a man; then, putting a drop of blood from her little finger into\nits mouth, she blew on it, and instantly the son of seven Queens started up as\nwell as ever.\n\n"Don\'t you disobey orders again!" grumbled the old hag, "or next time I\'ll\nleave you alone. Now be off, before I repent of my kindness!"\n\nSo the son of seven Queens returned joyfully to his seven mothers, who, by the\naid of the million-fold rice, soon became the richest people in the kingdom.\nThen they celebrated their son\'s marriage to the clever Princess with all\nimaginable pomp; but the bride was so clever, she would not rest until she had\nmade known her husband to his father, and punished the wicked white witch. So\nshe made her husband build a palace exactly like the one in which the seven\nQueens had lived, and in which the white witch now dwelt in splendour. Then,\nwhen all was prepared, she bade her husband give a grand feast to the King.\nNow the King had heard much of the mysterious son of seven Queens, and his\nmarvellous wealth, so he gladly accepted the invitation; but what was his\nastonishment when on entering the palace he found it was a facsimile of his\nown in every particular! And when his host, richly attired, led him straight\nto the private hall, where on royal thrones sat the seven Queens, dressed as\nhe had last seen them, he was speechless with surprise, until the Princess,\ncoming forward, threw herself at his feet, and told him the whole story. Then\nthe King awoke from his enchantment, and his anger rose against the wicked\nwhite hind who had bewitched him so long, until he could not contain himself.\nSo she was put to death, and her grave ploughed over, and after that the seven\nQueens returned to their own splendid palace, and everybody lived happily.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: A Lesson for Kings](ift18.htm)\n\n'
