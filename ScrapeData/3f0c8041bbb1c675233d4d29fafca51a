But wherever there are effects, there is division; as in ordinary life.\n\nThe conjunction 'but' is meant to exclude the suspicion of impossibility.--We\nmust not imagine the origin of ether to be impossible, because wherever we\nobserve effects (modifications of a substance), such as jars, pots and urns,\nor bracelets, armlets and earrings, or needles, arrows and swords, we also\nobserve division; while, on the other hand,\n\np. 14\n\nnothing which is not an effect is seen to be divided 1. Now, we apprehend\nether as divided from earth and so on; hence ether also must be an effect.\nThereby (i.e. by the circumstance of their being divided) place (di _s_ ),\ntime, mind (manas) and the atoms also are shown to be effects.\n\nBut--an objection may be raised--the Self also is divided from ether and so\non, and hence it follows that it is an effect like jars and the like.--This\nobjection we refute by pointing to the scriptural statement that 'ether sprang\nfrom the Self (Taitt. Up. II, 1). For if the Self also were a mere\nmodification (of something else), it would follow that all effects such as the\nether and so on are without a Self 2; for scripture mentions nothing beyond\nthe Self, and that Self itself would (on the supposition stated) be a mere\neffect. And thus we should be driven to the hypothesis of a general void ( _s_\nunyavada). Just because it is the Self, it is impossible for us to entertain\nthe idea even of its being capable of refutation. For the (knowledge of the)\nSelf is not, in any person's case, adventitious, not established through the\nso-called means of right knowledge; it rather is self-established. The Self\ndoes indeed employ perception and the other means of right knowledge for the\npurpose of establishing previously non-established objects of knowledge; for\nnobody assumes such things as ether and so on to be self-established\nindependently of the means of right knowledge. But the Self, as being the\nabode of the energy that acts through the means of right knowledge, is itself\nestablished previously to that energy. And to refute such a self-established\nentity is impossible. An adventitious thing, indeed, may be refuted, but not\nthat which is the essential nature (of him who attempts the refutation); for\nit is the essential nature of him who refutes. The heat of a fire is not\nrefuted (i.e. sublated) by the fire itself.--Let us further consider the\nrelation expressed in the following clauses: 'I know at the present moment\nwhatever is present; I knew (at former moments) the nearer and the remoter\npast; I shall know\n\np. 15\n\n(in the future) the nearer and the remoter future.' Here the object of\nknowledge changes according as it is something past or something future or\nsomething present; but the knowing agent does not change, since his nature is\neternal presence. And as the nature of the Self is eternal presence, it cannot\nundergo destruction even when the body is reduced to ashes; nay we cannot even\nconceive that it ever should become something different from what it is.--It\nthus follows from the essential irrefutability of its nature that the Self is\nnot an effect. The ether, on the other hand, falls under the category of\neffected things.\n\nTo the objection, raised above by the purvapakshin, that there is no plurality\nof homogeneous substances out of which the ether could originate, we reply\nthat it is not an absolute law that effects should originate only from things\nbelonging to the same genus, not from such as belong to different genera.\nThreads for instance and the conjunctions of threads 1 do not belong to the\nsame genus, the former being admitted to belong to the genus 'substance,' the\nlatter to the genus 'quality.' Nor again is there a binding rule that the\noperative causes such as the shuttle, the loom and so on should belong to the\nsame genus.--Well then let the doctrine that the causes must belong to the\nsame genus extend to the inherent causes only, not to the other causes 2.--But\nhere also there is no absolute rule. For we see that one and the same rope is\nmade of things belonging to different genera, such as threads and cow-hair,\nand several kinds of cloth are woven of vegetable thread and wool.--If it were\nassumed that the postulate of the inherent causes belonging to the same genus\nrefers only to the genera of essentiality, substantiality, &c., the rule would\nbe a superfluous one; for in that sense every inherent cause belongs to the\nsame genus as every other 3.\n\np. 16\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--Nor again is there an absolute rule that only a\nplurality of inherent causes, not one such cause, is able to originate an\neffect. For it is admitted that an atom as well as the mind (manas) originate\ntheir first activity; i.e. one atom by itself, and also the mind by itself,\ngive rise to their primary actions, without being in conjunction with other\nsubstances.--And, should it be said that there is an absolute rule as to\nseveral causes only having originating power in the case of the origination of\nsubstances only (not in the case of the origination of actions, &c.), we again\ndeny that, because it is admitted that there is such a thing as change\n(transformation). An absolute rule, such as maintained by you, would exist if\nsubstances did originate other substances, only when assisted by conjunction\n(a non-inherent cause). But, as a matter of fact, one and the same substance,\nwhen passing over into a different state distinguished by peculiar\ncharacteristic marks, is admitted to be an effect. In some cases more\nsubstances than one undergo the change, as when a young plant springs from\nseed and earth; in other cases one substance only changes, as when milk turns\ninto curds.--In short it is none of the Lord's laws that only several causes\nin conjunction should produce an effect. We therefore decide, on the authority\nof scripture, that the entire world has sprung from the one Brahman, ether\nbeing produced first and later on the other elements in due succession. A\nstatement to that effect has already been made above (II, 1, 24).\n\nThe further assertion made by the purvapakshin, that on the assumption of\nether having had an origin it is impossible to conceive a difference between\nthe former and later periods (the time before and after the origination of\nether) is likewise unfounded; for we have to understand that that very\nspecialising difference 1, from which we ascertain at present that there is a\nthing such as ether, different from earth and the other elements, did not\nexist before the\n\np. 17\n\norigination of ether. And just as Brahman's nature does not participate in the\nnature of earth and the other elements characterised by grossness and similar\nqualities,--according to such scriptural passages as 'It is not gross, it is\nnot subtle,'--so also it does not participate in the nature of ether, as we\nunderstand from the passage 'it is without other' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 8). It\ntherefore remains a settled conclusion that, before ether was produced,\nBrahman existed without ether.\n\nThe inference, drawn by the purvapakshin, that ether has no beginning, because\nit differs in nature from those substances which avowedly have a beginning,\nsuch as earth and so on, is without any value; for, as it is contradicted by\nscripture, it must be considered fallacious. We, on our part, have brought\nforward arguments showing that ether is an originated thing; and we may\nmoreover reason as follows: Ether is non-eternal, because it is the substratum\nof a non-eternal quality, viz. sound, just as jars and other things, which are\nthe substrata of non-eternal qualities, are themselves non-eternal.--Nor is\nthere any danger of this latter reasoning being extended to the Self also, for\nthe philosopher who takes his stand on the Upanishads does not admit that the\nSelf is the substratum of non-eternal qualities. Moreover, those who teach\nether to have an origin do not consider it proved that it is all-pervading and\nso on.\n\nIn reply to the remarks made under II, 3, 4 we point out that those scriptural\npassages which speak of the 'immortality of ether' are to be understood in the\nsame way as the analogous statements about the immortality of the gods 1,\nsince the origin and destruction of the ether have been shown to be possible.\nAnd if it is said of Brahman that 'it is omnipresent and eternal like ether,'\nBrahman is there compared to ether, whose greatness is well known, merely in\norder to indicate its supereminent greatness, not in order to maintain its\nbeing equal to ether. Similarly, when we say that the sun moves with the speed\nof an\n\np. 18\n\narrow, we merely mean that he moves fast, not that he moves at the same rate\nas an arrow. This remark explains that scriptural passage also in which\nBrahman is declared to be infinite like ether. On the other hand, such\npassages as 'It is greater than ether' prove that the extent of ether is less\nthan that of Brahman; passages like 'there is no image of him' ( _S_ ve. Up.\nIV, 19) show that there is nothing to compare Brahman to; and passages like\n'Everything else is of evil' (B _ri_. Up. III, 4, 2) show that everything\ndifferent from Brahman such as ether, &c. is of evil. All which serves to\nrefute the assertion that the passage which declares ether to have originated\nhas to be taken in a secondary sense, as the word Brahman actually has to be\ntaken in some passages. Scripture and reasoning in combination rather show\nthat ether has an origin, and the final conclusion therefore is that ether is\nan effect of Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[14:1](sbe38008.htm#fr_8) Whatever is divided, is an effect, as jars, pots,\n&c.
