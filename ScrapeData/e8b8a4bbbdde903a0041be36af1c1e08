The expression which I have translated\n'beginning from the wedding' is upayamanaprabh _ri_ ti. The Indian\ncommentators and Professor Stenzler explain the term upayamana as implying a\nreference to the Sutra I, 1, 4, upayamanan ku _s_ an adaya ('having taken up\nthe Ku _s_ a blades with which he is to take hold of the lower surface of the\n\xc3\x82 _g_ ya pot'). 'The worshipping of the domestic fire,' says Stenzler,\nfollowing the native authorities, 'consists in the rites which have been\nprescribed above (I, 1, 4), beginning from the word upayamana, i.e. in the\ntaking up of the Ku _s_ a blades, the putting of wood on the fire, the\nsprinkling and sacrificing. As the rites preceding that word, such as the\npreparation of the sacrificial spoon (I, 1, 3), are hereby excluded, the\noblations are offered with the hand.' It would be easy to show that the\nupayamana _h_ ku _s_ a _h_ have nothing at all to do with the regular morning\nand evening oblations of which these Sutras treat. The comparison of \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana-G _ri_ hya I, 9, 1 (see also Manu III, 67, &c.) leaves no doubt that\nupayamana is to be understood here as derived from upaya _k_ _kh_ ati in its\nvery frequent meaning of marrying. I have translated the Sutra accordingly.\n\n[286:2](sbe29163.htm#fr_721) On the different statements of Vedic authors with\nregard to the proper time of the morning oblations, see Weber's Indische\nStudien, X, 329.\n\n[287:5](sbe29163.htm#fr_722) Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I, 17, 9, where\nthe reading and the construction slightly differ. The words puna _h_ svaha at\nthe end of the Mantra seem to be corrupt; the frequent repetition of puma _m_\nsam and puman through the whole verse suggests the correction pu _m_ se svaha,\nor pumbhya _h_ svaha, 'to the man svaha!' or 'to the men svaha!'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I. 10](sbe29164.htm)\n\n"
