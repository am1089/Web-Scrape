But though we have shouted ourselves hoarse,\nproclaiming the Mussulmans to be our brethren, we have come to realize that we\nshall never be able to bring them wholly round to our side. So they must be\nsuppressed altogether and made to understand that we are the masters. They are\nnow showing their teeth, but one day they shall dance like tame bears to the\ntune we play.\n\n"If the idea of a United India is a true one," objects Nikhil, "Mussulmans are\na necessary part of it."\n\n"Quite so," said I, "but we must know their place and keep them there,\notherwise they will constantly be giving trouble."\n\n"So you want to make trouble to prevent trouble?"\n\n"What, then, is your plan?"\n\n"There is only one well-known way of avoiding quarrels," said Nikhil\nmeaningly.\n\nI know that, like tales written by good people, Nikhil\'s discourse always ends\nin a moral. The strange part of it is that with all his familiarity with moral\nprecepts, he still believes in them! He is an incorrigible schoolboy. His only\nmerit is his sincerity. The mischief with people like him is that they will\nnot admit the finality even of death, but keep their eyes always fixed on a\nhereafter.\n\nI have long been nursing a plan which, if only I could carry it out, would set\nfire to the whole country. True patriotism will never be roused in our\ncountrymen unless they can visualize the motherland. We must make a goddess of\nher. My colleagues saw the point at once. "Let us devise an appropriate\nimage!" they exclaimed. "It will not do if you devise-- it," I admonished\nthem. "We must get one of the current images accepted as representing the\ncountry--the worship of the people must flow towards it along the deep-cut\ngrooves of custom."\n\nBut Nikhil\'s needs must argue even about this. "We must not seek the help of\nillusions," he said to me some time ago, "for what we believe to be the true\ncause."\n\n"Illusions are necessary for lesser minds," I said, "and to this class the\ngreater portion of the world belongs. That is why divinities are set up in\nevery country to keep up the illusions of the people, for men are only too\nwell aware of their weakness."\n\n"No," he replied. "God is necessary to clear away our illusions. The\ndivinities which keep them alive are false gods."\n\n"What of that? If need be, even false gods must be invoked, rather than let\nthe work suffer. Unfortunately for us, our illusions are alive enough, but we\ndo not know how to make them serve our purpose. Look at the Brahmins. In spite\nof our treating them as demi-gods, and untiringly taking the dust of their\nfeet, they are a force going to waste.\n\n"There will always be a large class of people, given to grovelling, who can\nnever be made to do anything unless they are bespattered with the dust of\nsomebody\'s feet, be it on their heads or on their backs! What a pity if after\nkeeping Brahmins saved up in our armoury for all these ages--keen and\nserviceable- -they cannot be utilized to urge on this rabble in the time of\nour need."\n\nBut it is impossible to drive all this into Nikhil\'s head. He has such a\nprejudice in favour of truth--as though there exists such an objective\nreality! How often have I tried to explain to him that where untruth truly\nexists, there it is indeed the truth. This was understood in our country in\nthe old days, and so they had the courage to declare that for those of little\nunderstanding untruth is the truth. For them, who can truly believe their\ncountry to be a goddess, her image will do duty for the truth. With our nature\nand our traditions we are unable to realize our country as she is, but we can\neasily bring ourselves to believe in her image. Those who want to do real work\nmust not ignore this fact.\n\nNikhil only got excited. "Because you have lost the power of walking in the\npath of truth\'s attainment," he cried, "you keep waiting for some miraculous\nboon to drop from the skies! That is why when your service to the country has\nfallen centuries into arrears all you can think of is, to make of it an image\nand stretch out your hands in expectation of gratuitous favours."\n\n"We want to perform the impossible," I said. "So our country needs must be\nmade into a god."\n\n"You mean you have no heart for possible tasks," replied Nikhil. "Whatever is\nalready there is to be left undisturbed; yet there must be a supernatural\nresult:"\n\n"Look here, Nikhil," I said at length, thoroughly exasperated.\n\n"The things you have been saying are good enough as moral lessons. These ideas\nhave served their purpose, as milk for babes, at one stage of man\'s evolution,\nbut will no longer do, now that man has cut his teeth.\n\n"Do we not see before our very eyes how things, of which we never even dreamt\nof sowing the seed, are sprouting up on every side? By what power? That of the\ndeity in our country who is becoming manifest. It is for the genius of the age\nto give that deity its image. Genius does not argue, it creates. I only give\nform to what the country imagines.\n\n"I will spread it abroad that the goddess has vouchsafed me a dream. I will\ntell the Brahmins that they have been appointed her priests, and that their\ndownfall has been due to their dereliction of duty in not seeing to the proper\nperformance of her worship. Do you say I shall be uttering lies? No, say I, it\nis the truth--nay more, the truth which the country has so long been waiting\nto learn from my lips. If only I could get the opportunity to deliver my\nmessage, you would see the stupendous result."\n\n"What I am afraid of," said Nikhil, "is, that my lifetime is limited and the\nresult you speak of is not the final result. It will have after-effects which\nmay not be immediately apparent."\n\n"I only seek the result," said I, "which belongs to today."\n\n"The result I seek," answered Nikhil, "belongs to all time."\n\nNikhil may have had his share of Bengal\'s greatest gift-- imagination, but he\nhas allowed it to be overshadowed and nearly killed by an exotic\nconscientiousness. Just look at the worship of Durga which Bengal has carried\nto such heights. That is one of her greatest achievements. I can swear that\nDurga is a political goddess and was conceived as the image of the _Shakti_ of\npatriotism in the days when Bengal was praying to be delivered from Mussulman\ndomination. What other province of India has succeeded in giving such\nwonderful visual expression to the ideal of its quest?\n\nNothing betrayed Nikhil\'s loss of the divine gift of imagination more\nconclusively than his reply to me. "During the Mussulman domination," he said,\n"the Maratha and the Sikh asked for fruit from the arms which they themselves\ntook up. The Bengali contented himself with placing weapons in the hands of\nhis goddess and muttering incantations to her; and as his country did not\nreally happen to be a goddess the only fruit he got was the lopped-off heads\nof the goats and buffaloes of the sacrifice. The day that we seek the good of\nthe country along the path of righteousness, He who is greater than our\ncountry will grant us true fruition."\n\nThe unfortunate part of it is that Nikhil\'s words sound so fine when put down\non paper. My words, however, are not meant to be scribbled on paper, but to be\nscored into the heart of the country. The Pandit records his Treatise on\nAgriculture in printer\'s ink; but the cultivator at the point of his plough\nimpresses his endeavour deep in the soil.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X](hw31.htm)\n\n'
