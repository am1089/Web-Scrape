Renunciation of action, O Krishna, thou commendest, and again, its\nperformance. Which is the better one of these? Do thou tell me decisively. 1\n\np. 121\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n2\\. Both renunciation and performance of action lead to freedom: of these,\nperformance of action is superior to the renunciation of action. 2\n\np. 122\n\n3\\. He should be known a constant Sannyasi, who neither likes nor dislikes:\nfor, free from the pairs of opposites, mighty-armed, he is easily set free\nfrom bondage. 3\n\n4\\. Children, not the wise, speak of knowledge and performance of action, as\ndistinct. He who truly lives in one, gains the fruits of both. 4\n\np. 123\n\n5\\. The plane which is reached by the Jnanins is also reached by the\nKarmayogins. Who sees knowledge and performance of action as one, he sees.\n\n6\\. Renunciation of action, O mighty-armed, is hard to attain to without\nperformance of action; the man of meditation, purified by devotion to action,\nquickly goes to Brahman. 6\n\np. 124\n\n7\\. With the mind purified by devotion to performance of action, and the body\nconquered, and senses subdued, one who realises one\'s Self, as the Self in all\nbeings, though acting, is not tainted.\n\np. 125\n\n8-9. The knower of Truth, (being) centred (in the Self) should think, "I do\nnothing at all"--though seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, going,\nsleeping, breathing, speaking, letting go, holding, opening and closing the\neyes--convinced that it is the senses that move among sense-objects.\n\n10\\. He who does actions forsaking attachment, resigning them to Brahman, is\nnot soiled by evil, like unto a lotus-leaf by water. 10\n\np. 126\n\n11\\. Devotees in the path of work perform action, only with body, mind,\nsenses, and intellect, forsaking attachment, for the purification of the\nheart. 11\n\n12\\. The well-poised, forsaking the fruit of action, attains peace, born of\nsteadfastness; the unbalanced one, led by desire, is bound by being attached\nto the fruit (of action). 12\n\np. 127\n\n13\\. The subduer (of the senses), having renounced all actions by\ndiscrimination, rests happily in the city of the nine gates, neither acting,\nnor causing (others) to act. 13\n\np. 128\n\n14\\. Neither agency, nor actions does the Lord create for the world, nor (does\nHe bring about) the union with the fruit of action. It is universal ignorance\nthat does. (it all).\n\n15\\. The Omnipresent takes note of the merit or demerit of none. Knowledge is\nenveloped in ignorance, hence do beings get deluded. 15\n\np. 129\n\n16\\. But whose ignorance is destroyed by the knowledge of Self,--that\nknowledge of theirs, like the sun, reveals the Supreme (Brahman).\n\np. 130\n\n17\\. Those who have their intellect absorbed in That, whose self is That,\nwhose steadfastness is in That, whose consummation is That, their impurities\ncleansed by knowledge, they attain to Non-return (Moksha).\n\n18\\. The knowers of the Self look with an equal eye on a Brahmana endowed with\nlearning and humility, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a pariah. 18\n\np. 131\n\n19\\. (Relative) existence has been conquered by them, even in this world,\nwhose mind rests in evenness, since Brahman is even and without imperfection:\ntherefore they indeed rest in Brahman. 19\n\n20\\. Resting in Brahman, with intellect steady, and without delusion, the\nknower of Brahman neither rejoiceth on receiving what is pleasant, nor\ngrieveth on receiving what is unpleasant.\n\np. 132\n\n21\\. With the heart unattached to external objects, he realises the joy that\nis in the Self. With the heart devoted to the meditation of Brahman, he\nattains un-decaying happiness. 21\n\n22\\. Since enjoyments that are contact-born are parents of misery alone, and\nwith beginning and end, O son of Kunti, a wise man does not seek pleasure in\nthem.\n\np. 133\n\n23\\. He who can withstand in this world, before the liberation from the body,\nthe impulse arising from lust and anger, he is steadfast (in Yoga), he is a\nhappy man.\n\n24\\. Whose happiness is within, whose relaxation is within, whose light is\nwithin, that Yogi alone, becoming Brahman, gains absolute freedom. 24\n\np. 134\n\n25\\. With imperfections exhausted, doubts dispelled, senses controlled,\nengaged in the good of all beings, the Rishis obtain absolute freedom. 25\n\n26\\. Released from lust and anger, the heart controlled, the Self realised,\nabsolute freedom is for such Sannyasis, both here and hereafter.\n\np. 135\n\n27-28. Shutting out external objects, steadying the eyes between the eyebrows,\nrestricting the even currents of Prana and Apana inside the nostrils; the\nsenses, mind, and intellect controlled, with Moksha as the supreme goal, freed\nfrom desire, fear and anger: such a man of meditation is verily free for ever.\n27\n\np. 136\n\n29\\. Knowing Me as the dispenser of Yajnas and asceticisms, as the Great Lord\nof all worlds, as the friend of all beings, he attains Peace. 29\n\n\n\nThe end of the fifth chapter, designated The Way of Renunciation.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[120:1](sbg10.htm#fr_117) In IV. 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 32, 33, 37 and 41, the\nLord has spoken of the renunciation of all actions; and in IV. 42 He has\nexhorted Arjuna to engage in Yoga, in performance of action. Owing to the\nmutual opposition between the two, which makes it impossible for one man to\nresort to both of them at the same p. 121 time, doubt arises in the mind of\nArjuna, and hence the question as above.\n\n_Its performance_ --"Yoga" in the test: Yoga here and in the following verses\nmeans Karma-Yoga.\n\n[121:2](sbg10.htm#fr_118) _Performance of action_ --is superior to mere\nrenunciation ( _i.e._ , unaccompanied with knowledge) in the case of the\nnovice in the path of spirituality. See the 6th sloka of this chapter.\n\n[122:3](sbg10.htm#fr_119) _Constant Sanny asi:_ he need not have taken\nSannyasa formally, but if he has the above frame of mind, he is a Sannyasi for\never and aye.\n\n_Neither likes nor dislikes:_ Neither hates pain and the objects causing pain,\nnor desires pleasure and the objects causing pleasure, though engaged in\naction.\n\n[122:4](sbg10.htm#fr_120) Children: the ignorant people devoid of insight into\nthe purpose of the Shastra.\n\n[123:6](sbg10.htm#fr_121) It is not that renunciation of action based on\nknowledge is not superior to performance of action, p. 124 but that the latter\nmethod is easier for a beginner, and qualifies him for the higher path, by\npurifying his mind. Hence it is the proper, and therefore the superior course,\nin his case.\n\n[125:10](sbg10.htm#fr_122) _Evil:_ the results, good and bad, producing\nbondage.\n\n[126:11](sbg10.htm#fr_123) _Only with &c._--without egotism or selfishness: it\napplies to body, mind, senses and intellect.\n\n[126:12](sbg10.htm#fr_124) _Born of steadfastness:_ Sankara explains\nNaisthikim as gradual perfection in the path of knowledge, having the\nfollowing stages of development: (1) purity of heart, (2) gaining of p. 127\nknowledge, (3) renunciation of action, (4) steadiness in knowledge.\n\n[127:13](sbg10.htm#fr_125) _All actions:_ 1st, Nitya, or obligatory--the\nperformance of which does not produce any merit while the non-performance\nproduces demerit. 2nd, Naimittika, those arising on the occurrence of some\nspecial events, as the birth of a son: these also are customary. 3rd, Kamya--\nthose intended for securing some special ends: these are only optional. 4th,\nNishiddha--or forbidden. He rests happily in the body (of nine organic\nopenings), seeing inaction in action: just exhausting his Prarabdha--not\nrelating or identifying himself with anything of the dual universe.\n\n[128:15](sbg10.htm#fr_126) In unmistakable words, Krishna describes the\nposition of Iswara, or the Lord, in relation to the Universe, in these two\nverses.\n\nHe is all-blissful, all-perfect; even the shadow of a motive or relation in\nHim, would be contradictory p. 129 to His nature. His mere proximity to\nPrakriti or Nature endues the latter with power and potency of causing all\nthat is. Jiva is bound so long as it, relates itself to, and identifies itself\nwith this Nature. When it ceases to do so, it attains freedom. The whole\nteaching of the Gita, and therefore of the whole Hindu Scripture, on this\nsubject, is condensed in the above.\n\n[130:18](sbg10.htm#fr_127) Because they can see nothing but the Self. It makes\nno difference to the sun whether it be reflected in the Ganges, in wine, in a\nsmall pool, or in any unclean liquid: the same is the case with the Self. No\nUpadhi (or limiting adjunct) can attach to it.\n\n[131:19](sbg10.htm#fr_128) _Relative existence:_ All bondage as of birth,\ndeath etc. All possibility of bondage is destroyed when the mind attains\nperfect evenness, which in other words means--becoming Brahman.\n\n[132:21](sbg10.htm#fr_129) _Heart_ --Antah-karana.\n\n[133:24](sbg10.htm#fr_130) _Within:_ In the Self.\n\n_Absolute Freedom:_ Brahma-Nirvana. He attains Moksha while still living in\nthe body.\n\n[134:25](sbg10.htm#fr_131) Rishis: Men of right vision and renunciation.\n\n[135:27](sbg10.htm#fr_132) _External objects:_ Sound and other sense-objects.\nExternal objects are shut out from the mind by not thinking of them. When the\neyes are half-closed in meditation, the eye-balls remain fixed, and their gaze\nconverges, as it were, between the eyebrows. Prana is the out-going breath,\nApana the in-coming; the restriction described is effected by Pranayama.\n\nThese two verses are the aphorisms of which the following chapter is the\ncommentary.\n\n[136:29](sbg10.htm#fr_133) _Dispenser:_ Both as author and goal, the Lord is\nthe dispenser of the fruit of all actions.\n\n_Friend:_ Doer of good without expecting any return.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sixth Chapter.
