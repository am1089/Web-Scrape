Being born by strength [1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:1:1) in the ancient way,\nlo! he (Agni) has assumed instantly all the qualities of a sage. The Waters\nand the Dhisha _n_ a [2](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:1:2) have furthered the friend\n(Mitra [3](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:1:3)). The gods have held Agni as the giver of\nwealth.\n\n2\\. By the ancient Nivid [1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:2:1), by \xc3\x82yu's\n[2](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:2:2) wisdom he has procreated these children of men.\nWith his irradiating look [3](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:2:3) (he has procreated)\nthe Sky and the Waters. The gods have held Agni as the giver of wealth.\n\n3\\. The \xc3\x82ryan clans magnified [1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:3:1) him as the first\nperformer of sacrifices, as receiving offerings, as striving forward, the son\nof strength, the Bharata [2](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:3:2), the bestower of mighty\nrain (?) [3](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:3:3). The gods have held Agni as the giver\nof wealth.\n\n4\\. He, Matari _s_ van [1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:4:1), the lord of bountiful\nprosperity, has found a path for (his?) offspring, he who has found the sun,\nthe shepherd of the clans, the begetter of the two worlds. The gods have held\nAgni as the giver of wealth.\n\n5\\. Night and Dawn, who constantly destroy each other's appearance, suckle one\nyoung calf [1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:5:1) unitedly\n[2](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:5:2). The piece of gold [3](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:5:3)\nshines between Heaven and Earth. The gods have held Agni as the giver of\nwealth.\n\n6\\. (He is) the base of wealth, the assembler of all goods\n[1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:6:1), the beacon of sacrifice, the fulfiller of\nthought, the bird [2](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:6:2). In order to guard their\nimmortality\n\np. 120\n\nthe gods have held him, Agni, as the giver of wealth.\n\n7\\. Him who is now and who was formerly the abode of wealth, the earth\n[1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:7:1) (i. e. the dwelling-place or support) of what is\nborn and of what will be born, the shepherd and guardian of what is and of\nmuch that comes into being. The gods have held Agni as the giver of wealth.\n\n8\\. May (Agni,) the giver of wealth, present us with quick wealth. May the\ngiver of wealth (present us with wealth) united with strong men\n[1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:8:1). The giver of wealth (should grant us) food\ntogether with valiant heroes. The giver of wealth should grant us long life.\n\n9 = 95, 11.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verses 1, 2 = MS. IV, 10, 6. Verse 5 = VS. XII,\n2; XVII, 70; TS. IV, 1, 10, 4; 6, 5, 2; 7, 12, 3; MS. II, 7, 8.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. I. e. by the attrition of the woods, as sahasa _h_ putra _h_.\n\nNote 2. Two new discussions on dhisha _n_ a have been given by Hillebrandt\n(Ved. Mythologie, I, 175 seq.; comp. the criticisms of Ludwig, Ueber die\nneuesten arbeiten auf dem gebiete der R\xcc\xa3gveda-forschung, 85 seq.) and Pischel\n(Ved. Studien, II, 82 seq.). Hillebrandt arrives at the conclusion that dhisha\n_n_ a is the Earth (in the dual, Heaven and Earth; in the plural, Heaven. Air,\nand Earth), and besides the Vedi, i. e. the excavated spot of ground which\nserves as a kind of altar for the sacrifice. Similar is\n\np. 121\n\n[paragraph continues] Pischel's opinion. He believes that the singular dhisha\n_n_ a is everywhere to be interpreted as a proper name: the name of a goddess\nof wealth and prosperity. The dual dhisha _n_ e means 'Heaven and Earth:' thus\nthe original meaning of dhisha _n_ a must have been, as Pischel concludes,\neither Heaven or Earth. He tries to show that it is Earth, and so does Prof.\nHillebrandt. The goddess of wealth originally was a goddess of the earth\nconceived as the liberal giver of wealth. This goddess, Prof. Pischel thinks,\nwas closely related to, or even identical with, the goddess Aditi, whom the\nsame scholar also believes to be a personification of the Earth.\n\nI must confess that even this close agreement of these two distinguished\nscholars has failed to convince me. It is quite true that the dual dhisha _n_\ne means Heaven and Earth, and it is possible that the singular may, at least\nin some passages, mean the Earth. But I cannot believe that this is the\noriginal meaning of the word. Originally, in my opinion, dhisha _n_ a was an\nimplement used at the sacrifice, more especially at the Soma sacrifice. The\nadri (Soma-stones) are said to rest in the lap of the dhisha _n_ a (I, 109,\n3). In a Ya _g_ us Mantra referring to the sacrificial preparation of Soma (Va\n_g_ asaneyi Sa _m_ hita VI, 26) the dhisha _n_ a, or more exactly the Dhisha\n_n_ as, as goddesses (dhisha _n_ a _s_ _k_ a devi\xc2\xb4 _h_ ), are mentioned\ntogether with the sacrificial fire, the waters, and the gra\xc2\xb4va _n_ a _h_ , the\nstones. In a similar connection we find a Ya _g_ us formula pronounced when\nthe Adhvaryu began to beat the Soma plants with the Upa _m_ _s_ usavana stone\n(see Weber, Indische Studien, X, 370). There the Soma was addressed first, and\nthen the two Dhisha _n_ as: 'Do not be afraid, do not be terrified, assume sap\n(O Soma!). O two Dhisha _n_ as! Being firm show firmness!' (Va _g_ asaneyi Sa\n_m_ hita VI, 35). Here the _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a (III, 9, 4, 18) says,\nthat some authorities refer the last words to the two boards (phalake) on\nwhich the pressing-stones rest (see Hillebrandt, Ved. Mythologie, I, 149\nseq.). But the author of the Brahma _n_ a himself declares that Heaven and\nEarth are addressed; for as to the boards\n\np. 122\n\nused for pressing the Soma, it would be of no consequence if they were broken.\n--Other passages in which the dhisha _n_ a _h_ are mentioned in connection\nwith the preparation of the Soma, are Rig-veda IX, 59, 2; X, 17, 2. In the\nlast passage the lap of the Dh.' is mentioned as in I, 109, 3 (see above). The\ndhisha _n_ a was anointed, I, 102, 1. The dhisha _n_ a is mentioned in\nconnection with the waters which were fetched by the Adhvaryus and used at the\nsacrifice, X, 30, 6, and in connection with the sacrificial fire, III, 2, 1,\nand in our passage. I have therefore no doubt that according to the original\nmeaning the Dhisha _n_ a was, as stated above, a sacrificial implement used\nchiefly, though not exclusively, at the pressing of the Soma. I do not venture\nto determine the exact nature of this implement, but I think that from the\npassages collected above it will be evident that it was a sort of support on\nwhich the pressing-stones rested. A similar support may have been used for the\nvessel containing the sacrificial water, and for the sacrificial fire. This\nsupport was considered as yielding the Soma to Indra, as strengthening Indra,\nas inciting Indra and the gods to liberality towards men. Thus we have a\ngoddess Dhisha _n_ a who wears the aspect of a goddess of wealth. She is\ninvoked as one of the Gnas in I, 22, 10 with Hotra Bharati. Finally the Earth,\nthe support of everything, was likened to this support of the pressing-stones\nand of the Soma; and Heaven and Earth were then considered as the two Dhisha\n_n_ as.\n\nNote 3. Comp. above, 94, 13, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. On the solemn formulas of invocation, called Nivids, see Haug's\nAitareya Brahma _n_ a, p. 32 seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, IX, 355; H. O.,\nReligion des Veda, 387, note 2. Of course, the Nivids which _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana (\n_S_ rautasutra VIII, 16-25) gives, cannot be those to which the poets of the\nRig-veda several times allude.\n\nNote 2. On \xc3\x82yu as one of the mythical ancestors of\n\np. 123\n\nmankind, nearly related to Manu, see Bergaigne, Religion Vedique, I, 59 seq.\n\nNote 3. Ushas is called vivasvati, III, 30, 13 (cf. Bergaigne, I, 86); we are\njustified, consequently. in translating vivasvata _k_ akshasa, 'with the\nirradiating look.' But in giving this translation we should not forget that\nthe poet no doubt at the same time intended to allude to the name of Vivasvat,\nthe father of Yama.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The text has i _l_ ata. Comp. above, I, 1, 1, note 2.\n\nNote 2. Agni seems to be called Bharata as belonging to the people of\nBharatas. Comp. H. O., 'Buddha, sein Leben, seine Lehre, seine Gemeinde'\n(first edition), p. 414 seq. More usually Agni is designated as Bha\xc2\xb4rata.\n\nNote 3. S _ri_ pradanum. On da\xc2\xb4nu, the meaning of which I consider to be\n'rain' or the like, comp. the discussion of Prof. Max Muller, vol. xxxii, 113\nseq. The exact meaning of s _ri_ pra, which should not be compared with the\nGreek \xce\xbb\xce\xb9\xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, cannot be determined. The etymology is a very unsafe guide in\nsuch questions, and neither the connection with the root s _ri_ p, 'to creep,'\n'to crawl,' nor with the noun sarpis, 'butter,' seems to lead to a\nsatisfactory result. The passages in which s _ri_ pra or compounds of this\nadjective occur, point to a meaning like 'great,' 'mighty,' 'fine.' Thus s\n_ri_ prabho _g_ as seems to be something like purubho _g_ as or subho _g_ as;\nIndra's arms (karasna) are called both s _ri_ pra (VIII, 32, 10) and p _ri_\nthu (VI, 19, 3); finally s _ri_ pradanu, which is used here as an epithet of\nAgni, and VIII, 25, 5 of Mitra and Varu _n_ a, does not seem to differ very\nmuch from suda\xc2\xb4nu.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Matari _s_ van, the messenger of Vivasvat, who carried the fire from\nheaven to earth, was originally distinct from Agni, but is identified with him\nin several passages. See M. M., Physical Religion, p. 152; Bergaigne. Religion\nVedique, I; 52 seq.; H. O., Religion des Veda, 122.\n\np. 124\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Comp. above, 95, 1, and I, 113, 2. ru _s_ advatsa. The calf, of\ncourse, is Agni.\n\nNote 2. Literally, 'turned towards each other.'\n\nNote 3. The gold is again Agni.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The first Pada is identical with X, 139, 3.\n\nNote 2. I prefer with Ludwig to take ve _h_ as a nominative (comp. Lanman,\nNoun-Inflection, 375) instead of a genitive.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Compare the very obscure verse X, 31, 5. iyam sa\xc2\xb4 bhuya ushasam iva\nksha\xc2\xb4 _h_ , 'may she be the earth, as it were, of the dawns.' 'She' may\npossibly be the earth, which would be designated here as a dwelling-place or\nsupport of the dawns.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Prof. Max Muller proposes another translation of sanara. He writes:\n'One expects an opposition between tura and sanara. Sanara can hardly be the\nsame as viravat in the next line. I should like to take sanara as a variety of\nsana and sanatana. Give us fleeting, i. e. daily wealth, and give us old, i.\ne. lasting wealth!'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 97](sbe46033.htm)\n\n"
