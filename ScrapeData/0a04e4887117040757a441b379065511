Him followed then  \nHis son M'andh'at'a, king of men.  \nHis son was blest in high emprise,  \nSusandhi, fortunate and wise.  \nTwo noble sons had he, to wit  \nDhruvasandhi and Prasenajit,  \nBharat was Dhruvasandhi's son:  \nHis glorious arm the conquest won,  \nAgainst his son King Asit, rose  \nIn fierce array his royal foes,  \nHaihayas, T'alajanghas styled,  \nAnd S'as'ivindhus fierce and wild.  \n\np. 220  \n\nLong time he strove, but forced to yield  \nFled from his kingdom and the field.  \nThe wives he left had both conceived--  \nSo is the ancient tale believed:--  \nOne, of her rival's hopes afraid,  \nFell poison in the viands laid.  \nIt chanced that Chyavan, Bhrigu's child,  \nHad wandered to the pathless wild  \nWhere proud Hima'laya's lovely height  \nDetained him with a strange delight.  \nThen came the other widowed queen  \nWith lotus eyes and beauteous mien,  \nLonging a noble son to bear,  \nAnd wooed the saint with earnest prayer.  \nWhen thus Kal'indi', fairest dame  \nWith reverent supplication came,  \nTo her the holy sage replied:  \n'O royal lady, from thy side  \nA glorious son shall spring ere long,  \nRighteous and true and brave and strong;  \nHe, scourge of foes and lofty-souled,  \nHis ancient race shall still uphold.'  \n   Then round the sage the lady went,  \nAnd bade farewell, most reverent.  \nBack to her home she turned once more,  \nAnd there her promised son she bore.  \nBecause her rival mixed the bane  \nTo render her conception vain,  \nAnd her unripened fruit destroy,  \nSagar she called her rescued boy. 1  \nHe, when he paid that solemn rite, 2  \nFilled living creatures with affright:  \nObedient to his high decree  \nHis countless sons dug out the sea.  \nPrince Asamanj was Sagar's child:  \nBut him with cruel sin defiled  \nAnd loaded with the people's hate  \nHis father banished from the state.  \nTo Asamanj his consort bare  \nBright Ans'uma'n his valiant heir.  \nAns'uma'n's son, Dili'pa famed,  \nBegot a son Bhagi'rath named.  \nFrom him renowned Kakutstha came:  \nThou bearest still the lineal name,  \nKakutstha's son was Raghu: thou  \nArt styled the son of Raghu now,  \nFrom him came Purusha'dak bold,  \nFierce hero of gigantic mould:  \nKalma'shapa'da s name he bore,  \nBecause his feet were spotted o'er.  \nSankhan his son, to manhood grown,  \nDied sadly with his host o'erthrown,  \nBut ere he perished sprang from him  \nSudars'an fair in face and limb.  \nFrom beautiful Sudarsa'n came  \nPrince Agnivarna, bright as flame.  \nHis son was S'ighragn, for speed  \nUnmatched; and Maru was his seed.  \n\nPrasusruka was Maru's child:  \nHis son was Ambari'sha styled.  \nNahush was Ambari'sha's heir  \nWith hand to strike and heart to dare.  \nHis son was good Na'bha'g, from youth  \nRenowned for piety and truth.  \nFrom great Na'bha'g sprang children two  \nAja and Suvrat pure and true.  \nFrom Aja Das'aratha came,  \nWhose virtuous life was free from blame  \nHis eldest son art thou: his throne,  \nO famous Kama, is thine own.  \nAccept the sway so justly thine.  \nAnd view the world with eyes benign.  \nFor ever in Iksava'ku's race  \nThe eldest takes his father's place,  \nAnd while he lives no son beside  \nAs lord and king is sanctified.  \n   The rule by Raghu's children kept  \n     Thou must not spurn to-day.  \n   This realm of peerless wealth accept,  \n     And like thy father sway.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[219:1](ry187.htm#fr_388) The verses in a different metre with which some\ncantos end are all to be regarded with suspicion.
