I came when the great autumn feast of the Mother was past; I was\nthere at the ending of the winter when plague broke out in our midst, and the\nstreets at night were thronged with seething multitudes, who sang strange\nlitanies and went half mad with religious excitement; I remained through the\nterrific heat, when activity became a burden, and only one\'s Hindu friends\nunderstood how to live; I left my home for a time when the tropical rains had\nbegun, and in the adjoining roads the cab-horses were up to their girths in\nwater hour after hour.\n\nWhat a beautiful old world it was in which I spent those months! It moved\nslowly, to a different rhythm from anything that one had known. It was a world\nin which a great thought or intense emotion was held as the true achievement,\ndistinguishing the day as no deed could. It was a world in which men in loin-\ncloths, seated on door-sills in dusty lanes, said things about Shakespeare and\nShelley that some of us would go far to hear. It was full of gravity,\n\np. 2\n\nsimplicity, and the solid and enduring reality of great character and will.\n\nFrom all round the neighbourhood at sunset would come the sound of gongs and\nbells in the family-chapel of each house, announcing Evensong. At that same\nhour might the carpenter be seen censing his tools, or the schoolboy, perhaps,\nhis inkstand and pen, as if thanking these humble creatures of the day\'s\nservice; and women on their way to worship would stop wherever a glimpse of\nthe Ganges was possible, or before a bo-tree or tulsi-plant, to salute it,\njoining their hands and bowing the head. More and more, as the spirit of Hindu\nculture became the music of life, did this hour and that of sunrise grow to be\nthe events of my day. One learns in India to believe in what Maeterlinck calls\n"the great active silence," and in such moments consciousness, descending like\na plummet into the deeps of personality, and leaving even thought behind,\nseems to come upon the unmeasured and immeasurable. The centre of gravity is\nshifted. The seen reveals itself as what India declares it, merely the\nwreckage of the Unseen, cast up on the shores of Time and Space. Nothing that\nhappens within the activity of daylight can offer a counter-attraction to this\nexperience. But then, as we must not forget, the Indian day is pitched in its\nkey. Tasks are few, and are to be performed with dignity and earnestness.\nEverything has its aureole of associations. Eating and bathing--with us\nchiefly selfish operations--are here great sacramental acts, guarded at all\npoints by social honour and the passion of purity. From sunrise to sunset the\nlife of the nation moves on, and the hum of labour and the clink of tools rise\nup, as in some vast monastery, accompanied by the chanting of prayers and the\natmosphere of recollectedness. The change itself from daylight to darkness is\nincredibly swift.\n\np. 3\n\n[paragraph continues] A few fleecy clouds gather on the horizon and pass from\nwhite, maybe, to orange and even crimson. Then the sun descends, and at once\nwe are alone with the deep purple and the tremulous stars of the Indian night.\nFar away in the North, hour after hour, outlines go on cutting themselves\nclearer against the green and opal sky, and long low cliffs grow slowly dim\nwith shadows on the sea. The North has Evening: the South, Night.\n\n\n\nTropical thunderstorms are common through April and May at the day\'s end, and\nthe terrible convulsion of Nature that then rages for an hour or two gives a\nsimple parallel to many instances of violent contrast and the logical extreme\nin Indian art and history. This is a land where men will naturally spend the\nutmost that is in them. And yet, side by side with the scarlet and gold of the\nloom, how inimitably delicate is the blending of tints in the tapestry! It is\nso with Indian life. The most delicate nuance and remorseless heroism exist\nside by side, and are equally recognised and welcomed, as in the case of a\nchild I knew--a child whose great grandmother had perhaps committed suttee--\nwho ran to his mother with the cry, "Mother! Mother! save me from Auntie! She\nis, beating me with her eyes!"\n\nThe foundation-stone of our knowledge of a people must be an understanding of\ntheir region. For social structure depends primarily on labour, and labour is\nnecessarily determined by place. Thus we reach the secret of thought and\nideals. As an example of this we have only to see how the Northman, with his\neyes upon the sun, carries into Christianity the great cycle of fixed feasts\nthat belongs to Midsummer\'s Day and Yule, approximately steady in the solar\nyear; while the child of the South, to whom the lunar sequence is everything,\n\np. 4\n\ncontributes Easter and Whitsuntide. The same distinction holds in the history\nof Science, where savants are agreed that in early astronomy the sun elements\nwere first worked out in Chaldea and the moon in India. To this day the boys\nand girls at school in Calcutta know vastly more about the moon and her phases\nthan their English teachers, whose energies in this kind have been chiefly\nspent in noting the changes in shadow-length about an upright stick during the\ncourse of day. Evidently Education--that process which is not merely the\nactivity of the reading and writing mill, but all the preparedness that life\nbrings us for all the functions that life demands of us--Education is vitally\ndetermined by circumstances of place.\n\n\n\nThe woman pausing in the dying light to salute the river brings us to another\nsuch instance. There is nothing occult in the passion of Hindus for the\nGanges. Sheer delight in physical coolness, the joy of the eyes, and the\ngratitude of the husbandman made independent of rain, are sufficient basis.\nBut when we add to this the power of personification common to naives peoples,\nand the peculiarly Hindu genius of idealism, the whole gamut of associations\nis accounted for. Indeed, it would be difficult to live long beside the Ganges\nand not fall under the spell of her personality. Yellow, leonine, imperious,\nthere is in her something of the caprice, of the almost treachery, of\nbeautiful women who have swayed the wills of the world. Semiramis, Cleopatra,\nMary Stuart, are far from being the Hindu ideal, but the power of them all is\nin that great mother whom India worships. For to the simple, the Ganges is\ncompletely mother. Does she not give life and food? To the pious she is the\nbestower of purity, and as each bather steps into her flood, he stoops\ntenderly to place a little of the water on his head, craving pardon with words\nof salutation for the touch of his\n\np. 5\n\nfoot. To the philosopher she is the current of his single life, sweeping\nirresistibly onward to the universal. To the travelled she tells of Benares\nand the mountain snows, and legends of Siva the Great God, and Uma Himavutee,\nmother of all womanhood. Or she brings memories of the Indian Christ and His\nyouth among the shepherds in the forests of Brindaban on her tributary Jumna.\nAnd to the student of history she is the continuity of Aryan thought and\ncivilisation through the ages, giving unity and meaning to the lives of races\nand centuries as she passes through them, carrying the message of the past\never into the future, a word of immense promise, an assurance of unassailable\ncertainty. But with all this and beyond it all, the Ganges, to her lovers, is\na person. To us, who have fallen so far away from the Greek mode of seeing,\nthis is difficult perhaps to understand. But living in a Calcutta lane the\npowers of the imagination revive; the moon-setting becomes again Selene riding\non the horse with the veiled feet; Phoebus Apollo rising out of one angle of a\npediment is a convincing picture of the morning sky; and the day comes when\none surprises oneself in the act of talking with earth and water as conscious\nliving beings. One is ready now to understand the Hindu expression of love for\nriver and home. It is a love with which the day\'s life throbs. "Without\npraying, no eating! Without bathing, no praying!" is the short strict rule to\nwhich every woman at least conforms; hence the morning bath in the river is\nthe first great event of the day. It is still dark when little companies of\nwomen of rank begin to leave their houses on foot for the bathing-stairs.\nThese are the proud and high-bred on whom "the sun has never looked." Too\nsensitive to tolerate the glance of passers by, and too faithful to forego the\nsanctifying immersion, they cut the knot of both difficulties at\n\np. 6\n\nonce in this way. Every moment of the ablution has its own invocation, and the\nreturn journey is made, carrying a brass vessel full of the sacred water which\nwill be used all day to sprinkle the place in which any eats or prays.\n\nTheir arrival at home finds already waiting those baskets of fruit and flowers\nwhich are to be used in worship; for one of the chief acts of Hindu devotion\nconsists in burying the feet of the adored in flowers. The feet, from their\ncontact with all the dusty and painful ways of the world, have come to be\nlowliest and most despised of all parts of the body, while the head is so\nsacred that only a superior may touch it. To take the dust of the feet of the\nsaints or of an j image, therefore, and put it upon one\'s head, is emblematic\nof all reverence and sense of unworthiness, and eager love will often address\nitself to the "lotus-feet" of the beloved. Amongst my own friends, health\nforbade the bathing before dawn, and poverty did not allow of the visit to the\nriver in closed palkee every day. But half-past nine or ten always found the\nyounger women busy bringing incense and flowers and Ganges water for the\nmother\'s "puja," as it is called; and then, while she performed the daily\nceremonies, they proceeded to make ready the fruits and sweets which were\nafterwards to be blessed and distributed.\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to see the difference between a temple and a church. The\nformer may seem absurdly small, for theoretically it is simply a covered\nshrine which contains one or other of certain images or symbols, before which\nappropriate offerings are made and prescribed rituals performed by duly\nappointed priests. The table is only properly called an altar in temples of\nthe Mother; in other cases it would be more correct perhaps to speak of the\nthrone, since fruit and flowers are the only\n\np. 7\n\nsacrifices permitted. So it is clear that the Eastern temple corresponds to\nthat part of the Christian church which is known technically as the sanctuary.\nThe worshipper is merely incidental here; he sits or kneels on the steps, and\npays the priest to perform for him some special office; or he reads and\ncontemplates the image in a spirit of devotion. The church, on the other hand,\nincludes shrine and congregation, and has more affinity to the Mohammedan\nmosque, which is simply a church with the nave unroofed.\n\nTemples are not very popular in Bengal, every house being supposed to have its\nchapel or oratory, for which the ladies care, unless the family be rich enough\nto maintain a chaplain. Even the services of a Brahmin in the house or\nneighbourhood, however, will not dispense them from the offering of elaborate\npersonal puja before the morning meal can be thought of. I can never forget a\nreproach levelled at myself on this point.\n\nIt was my first morning in a Hindu home. I had arrived at dawn, tired and\ndusty after days of railway travel, and had lain down on a mat spread on the\nfloor, to sleep. Towards eight o\'clock, the thought of my tea-basket\nbrightened my despair, and I turned eagerly to open and secure its\nrefreshment. Suddenly a little boy stood before me like a young avenging\nangel. His great brown eyes were full of pain and surprise, such as only a\nchild\'s face ever adequately shows. He did not know much English and spoke\ndeliberately, laying terrible emphasis on each word, "Have--you--said--your--\nprayers?" he said.\n\n\n\nIt is a little strange, during the rains, to have to take an umbrella to go\nupstairs, but without my two courtyards in the middle of the house the hot\nweather would have been insupportable in Calcutta.\n\np. 8\n\n[paragraph continues] These make the Eastern home, by day, a cave of all winds\nthat blow, and at night a tent roofed in by the starry universe itself. No one\nwho has not experienced it can know quite what it means to return in the\nevening and open the door upon the sky and stars that one is leaving without.\nThe Indian night is in itself something never to be forgotten. Vast and deep\nand black it seems, lighted by large soft stars that throb and gleam with an\nunknown brilliance, while the stillness is broken only by some night-beggar\nwho chants the name of God in the distant streets, or by the long-drawn howl\nof the jackals crying the quarters of the night across the open plain. Even\nthe moonlight itself, with the palm-trees whispering and throwing ink-black\nshadows, is not more beautiful than these solemn "dark nights," when the\nblindness and hush of things brood over the soul with their mighty motherhood.\n\n\n\nJust as the housewives of some European university town in the Middle Ages\nwould feel responsible for the welfare of the "poor scholar," so to the whole\nof Hindu society, which has assimilated in its own way the functions of the\nuniversity, the religious student is a common burden. Where he is, there is\nthe university, and he must be supported by the nearest householders. For this\nreason, I, being regarded as a student of their religion, my good neighbours\nwere unfailing of kindness in the matter of household supplies. Perhaps the\nmost striking instance of this lay in the fact that when I was to have a guest\nI had only to say so, and friends in the vicinity would send in a meal ready-\ncooked, or the necessary bedding, without my even knowing the names of those\nto whom I owed the bounty. And with all this, there was no question as to the\ncourse of my study or the conclusions I\n\np. 9\n\nwas reaching--no criticism, either, of its form. They simply accorded to a\nEuropean woman the care they were accustomed to bestow on the ashen-clad\nascetic, because they understood that some kind of disinterested research was\nher object also,, and they knew so well that the management of affairs was no\npart of the function of the scholar. What do we not read of the depth of a\nculture that is translated and re-applied with such ease as this? And what do\nwe not learn of the intellectual freedom and development of the people?\n\nFew things, even in Indian life, are so interesting as this matter of the\nsocial significance of the beggar. That distaste for property which we see in\nsuch lives as Kant\'s and Spinoza\'s resolves itself readily in the Indian\nclimate into actual destitution. Shelter and clothing are hardly necessities\nthere: a handful of rice and a few herbs such as can be obtained at any door\nare alone indispensable. But everything conspires to throw upon such as beg\nthe duty of high thinking and the exchange of ideas with their supporters.\nHence the beggar makes himself known by standing in the courtyard and singing\nsome hymn or prayer. He comes always, that is to say, in the Name of God.\nThere is a whole literature of these beggars\' songs, quaint and simple, full\nof what we in Europe call the Celtic spirit. In his lowest aspect, therefore,\nthe Indian beggar is the conserver of the folk-poetry of his country. Where\nhis individuality is strong, however, he is much more. To the woman who serves\nhim he is then the religious teacher, talking with her of subjects on which\nshe can rarely converse, and in this way carrying the highest culture far and\nwide.\n\nIt is said that the deep familiarity of Punjabi women with Hindu philosophy is\nthe result of the strong recrudescence of the characteristic national\n\np. 10\n\ncharity under Runjeet Singh. When we think of the memories that would linger\nbehind such a visitor--the man whose whole face spoke knowledge, standing at\nthe door one noon and asking alms--we come upon a trace of the feeling that\npaints the Great God as a beggar.\n\nIt is droll to find that the whole city is parcelled out into wards, each of\nwhich is visited regularly on a given day. My days were Wednesday and Sunday,\nand going out one of these mornings about nine, I was fortunate enough to\ncatch the whole procession coming up the lane. Men and women they were,\nelderly for the most part, but hale and well, with their long staffs in the\nright hand, and metal or wooden bowls in the left--amongst the most cheerful\nhuman beings I ever saw. The fact of this regular division of the city puts\nthe affair at once on the basis of a poor-rate (of which we have none in\nIndia), and shows that in ways appropriate to themselves the Hindu people are\nas able organisers as any. It may be that in Western cities the workhouse is a\nnecessary solution, but certainly this Indian distribution of want over the\nwealthier community, with its joining of the act of giving to the natural\nsentiment, seems a good deal less mechanical and more humane than ours. It is\nvery amusing sometimes to see how tenacious people are of their own\nsuperstitions. I have seen an English woman made really unhappy because an\nIndian beggar would not accept a loaf she bought and handed to him, while he\nwould have been very thankful for the money that it cost. The donor and her\nfriends were in despair at what they regarded as utterly impracticable. Yet to\nthe onlooker it seemed that the obstinacy was on their own side. In England we\nare warned that alcohol is a constant temptation to the poor and ill-fed; it\nis better, therefore, to give food than money. In India, on\n\np. 11\n\nthe other hand, there is no risk whatever on this score; for not one man in a\nhundred ever tasted liquor, and at the same time a Hindu beggar at least may\nnot eat bread made with yeast, or baked by any but Hindus of his own or better\ncaste. Now the offering made in this case was of yeast-made bread, baked by a\nMohammedan, and handled by a Christian! To the poor man it was evident that\nthe lady was willing to give; why should she load her gift with impossible\nconditions? And for my own part I could but echo, why?\n\nAmong the quaintest customs are those of the night-beggars. These are\nMohammedans, but all fields are their pasture. They carry a bowl and a lamp as\ntheir insignia of office. It is common amongst these gentlemen to fix on a sum\nat sunset that they deem sufficient for their modest wants, and to vow that\nthey shall know no rest till this is gathered. As the hours go on, therefore,\nthey call aloud the balance that remains; and persons coming late home or\nwatching by the sick are often glad to pay the trifle and gain quiet. Yet\nthere is something weird and solemn in waking from sleep to hear the name of\nAllah cried beneath the stars in a kind of Perpetual Adoration.\n\n\n\nLike a strong tide beating through the months, rise and fall the twelve or\nthirteen great religious festivals, or Pujas. Chief of them all, in Bengal, is\nthe autumn Durga-Puja, or Festival of the Cosmic Energy. A later month is\ndevoted to the thought of all that is gentle and tender in the Motherhood of\nNature. Again it is the Indian Minerva, Saraswati, who claims undivided\nattention. Those who have lived in Lancashire will remember how the aspect of\nstreets and cottages is changed towards Simnel Sunday. Every window is\ndecorated with cakes, and every cake bears a spirited picture in comfits of\n\np. 12\n\nsome coaching or other local scene. And everywhere, with us at Christmas-time,\nthe shops are gay with holly and mistletoe, so that there is no mistaking the\ntime of year. Similarly, in Calcutta, as each puja comes round, characteristic\narticles appear in the bazaars. At one time it is hand-screens made of\nbeetles\' wings and peacocks\' feathers, and every shop and every pedlar seems\nto carry these beautiful fans. Through September and October, as the Durga-\nPuja approaches, the streets resound with carols to the Mother. But the most\ncharming of all is the Farewell Procession with the Image.\n\nFor no image may be kept more than the prescribed number of days, usually\nthree. Up to the evening before the feast it is not sacred at all, and any one\nmay touch it. Then, however, a Brahmin, who has fasted all day, meditates\nbefore the figure, and, as it is said, "magnetises" it. The texts he chants\nare claimed to be aids to the concentration of his own mind, and to have no\nother function. When the image has been consecrated it becomes a sacred\nobject, but even then it is not actually worshipped. Its position is that of a\nstained-glass window, or an altar-piece, in an Anglican church. It is a\nsuggestion offered to devout thought and feeling. On the step before it stands\na brass pitcher full of water, and the mental effort of the worshipper is\ndirected upon this water; for even so, it is said, does the formless Divine\nfill the Universe. It would seem that the Hindu mind is very conscious of the\npossibility that the image may thwart its own intention and become an idol;\nfor not only is this precaution taken in the act of adoration, but it is\ndirected that at the end of the puja it shall be conveyed away and thrown\nbodily into the river! On the third evening, therefore, towards sunset, the\nprocession forms itself, little contingents joining it from every house in the\nvillage as it passes the door, each headed by one or\n\np. 13\n\ntwo men bearing the figure of the god or goddess, and followed by the children\nof the family and others. It is a long and winding march to the Ganges\' side.\nArrived there, the crown is carefully removed, to be kept a year for good\nluck; and then, stepping down into the stream, the bearers heave up their load\nand throw it as far as they can. We watch the black hair bobbing up and down\nin the current for awhile, and then, often amid the tears of the children,\nturn back to the house from which a radiant guest has departed. There is\nquietness now where for three days have been worship and feasting. But the\ntired women are glad to rest from the constant cooking, and even the babies\nare quickly cheered, for it will be but a month or two till some new festival\nshall bring to them fresh stores of memory.\n\n\n\nThe great decorum of Oriental life is evident when one has to come or go\nthrough a Hindu city in the evening. Doorways and windows are flanked with\nbroad stone benches, and here, after the evening meal, sit numbers of men in\nearnest conversation. But any woman is safe in such a street. Not even the\nfreedom of a word or look will be offered. As Lakshman, in the great Epic,\nrecognised among the jewels of Sita only her anklets, so honour demands of\nevery man that he look no higher than the feet of the passing woman; and the\nbehest is so faithfully observed that on the rare occasions when an Indian\nwoman may need to undergo the ordeal I have known her own brother to let her\ngo unrecognised. For one need not say that women do now and then slip out on\nfoot at nightfall, accompanied by a maid bearing a lamp, to enjoy an hour\'s\ngossip in some neighbour\'s house. We are all familiar with the powers of\ncriticism of quiet women who never strayed into the great world, or saw more\nthan the view from their own thresholds would reveal. What is\n\np. 14\n\ntrue in this respect of the Western cottage is true also of the Eastern\nzenana. Woman\'s penetration is everywhere the same. Her good breeding makes\neverywhere the same demands. On one occasion I had the misfortune to introduce\ninto my Indian home a European whose behaviour caused me the deepest\nmortification. But the ladies sat on the case when she had gone, and gravely\ndiscussed it in all its bearings. Finally it was gently dismissed with the\nremark, "she was not well-born." On another occasion I came in one evening at\nthe moment of some distinguished friend\'s arrival. Such was the _empressement_\nof her reception, the warmth of the inquiries after her health and so on, that\nI felt myself to be certainly an intrusion But a quiet hand detained me when I\nwould have slipped away. "Wait," said the Mother, "till I have finished, for I\nhaven\'t the least idea who she is!"\n\n\n\nThere were, however, certain practical difficulties in the life. It had taken\nsome time, in the first place, to discover a house that could be let to an\nEnglishwoman; and when this was done it was still a few weeks before a Hindu\ncaste-woman could be found who would be my servant. She turned up at last,\nhowever, in the person of an old, old woman, who called me "Mother," and whom\nI, at half her age, had to address as "Daughter" or "Jhee." This aged servitor\nwas capable enough of the wholesale floodings of the rooms which constituted\nhouse-cleaning, as well of producing boiling water at stated times for the\ntable and the bath. For some reason or other she had determined in my case to\nperform these acts on condition that I never entered her kitchen or touched\nher fire or water-supply. Yet hot water was not immediately procurable. And\nthe reason? We possessed no cooking-stove. I asked the price of this necessary\narticle, and was told\n\np. 15\n\nsix farthings. Armed with which sum, sure enough, my trusty retainer brought\nhome a tile, a lump of clay, and a few thin iron bars, and constructed from\nthese, with the greatest skill, the stove we needed.\n\nIt took some days to set and harden, but at last the work was complete.\nAfternoon tea, prepared under my own roof, was set triumphantly before me, and\nmy ancient "daughter" squatted on the verandah facing me, with the hot kettle\non the stone floor beside her, to see what strange thing might come to pass. I\npoured out a cup of tea and held out the pot to Jhee for more hot water. To my\namazement she only gave a sort of grunt and disappeared into the inner\ncourtyard. When she came back, a second later, she was dripping with cold\nwater from head to foot. Before touching what I was about to drink she had\nconsidered a complete immersion necessary!\n\n\n\nHow happy were those days in the little lane! how unlike the terrible pictures\nof the Hindu routine which, together with that of the Pharisees in the New\nTestament, had embittered my English childhood! Constant ablutions, endless\nprostrations, unmeaning caste-restrictions, what a torture the dreary tale had\nbeen! And the reality was so different! My little study, with its modern\npictures and few books, looked out on the cheeriest of neighbours. Here, a\nbrown baby, with black lines under his eyes, and a gold chain round his waist,\ncarried in triumph by his mother or nurse; there, some dignified woman, full\nof sweetness, as a glance would show, on her way to the bathing-ghat; again, a\nquiet man, with intellectual face and Oriental leisure; and, above it all, the\ntall palm-trees, with little brown villages and fresh-water tanks nestling at\ntheir feet, while all kinds \'of birds flew about fearlessly just outside my\nwindow, and\n\np. 16\n\nthrew their shadows across my paper as I wrote. The golden glow of one\'s first\nsensation suffuses it still. It was all like a birth into a new world.\n\n\n\nOne evening, as I prepared for supper, a sound of wailing broke the after-\ndarkness quiet of the lane, and making my way in the direction of the cry, I\nentered the court-yard of some servants\' huts, just opposite. On the floor of\nthe yard a girl lay dying, and as we sat and watched her, she breathed her\nlast. Hours went by, and while the men were away at the burning-ghat, making\narrangements for the funeral-fire that would be over before dawn, I sat with\nthe weeping women, longing to comfort them, yet knowing not what to say. At\nlast the violence of their grief had exhausted them, and even the mother of\nthe dead girl lay back in my arms in a kind of stupor, dazed into\nforgetfulness for awhile. Then, as is the way of sorrow, it all swept over her\nagain, in a flood of despair. "Oh!" she cried, turning to me, "what shall I\ndo? Where is my child now?"\n\nI have always regarded that as the moment in which I found the key. Filled\nwith a sudden pity, not so much for the bereaved woman as for those to whom\nthe use of some particular language of the Infinite is a question of morality,\nI leaned forward. "Hush, mother!" I said, "your child is with the Great\nMother. She is with Kali!" And then, for a moment, with memory stilled, we\nwere enfolded together, Eastern and Western, in the unfathomed depths of\nconsolation of the World-Heart.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II.
