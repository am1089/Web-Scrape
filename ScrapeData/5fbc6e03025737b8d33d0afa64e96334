And the ideas of \xc3\x82ditya and so on (are to be superimposed) on the members\n(of the sacrificial action); owing to the effectuation (of the result of the\nsacrifice).\n\n'He who burns up these, let a man meditate upon him as udgitha' ( _Kh_. Up. I,\n3, i); 'Let a man meditate on the fivefold Saman in the worlds' ( _Kh_. Up.\nII, 2, i); 'Let a man meditate on the sevenfold Saman in speech' ( _Kh_. Up.\nII, 8, i); 'This earth is the _Ri_ _k_ , fire is Saman' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 6, i).\n--With regard to these and similar meditations limited to members of\nsacrificial action, there arises a doubt whether the text enjoins\ncontemplations on the udgitha and so on superinduced on \xc3\x82ditya and so on, or\nelse contemplations on \xc3\x82ditya, &c. superinduced on the udgitha and so on.\n\nNo definite rule can here be established, the purvapakshin maintains, since\nthere is no basis for such a rule. For in the present case we are unable to\nascertain any special pre-eminence, while we were able to do so in the case of\nBrahman. Of Brahman, which is the cause of the whole world and free from all\nevil and so on, we can assert definitively that it is superior to \xc3\x82ditya and\nso on; the udgitha and so on, on the other hand, are equally mere effects, and\nwe cannot therefore with certainty ascribe to any of them any pre-eminence.--\nOr else we may decide that the ideas of the udgitha and so on arc to be\nsuperinduced exclusively on \xc3\x82ditya and so on. For the udgitha and so on are of\nthe nature of sacrificial work, and as it is known that the fruit is attained\nthrough the work, \xc3\x82ditya\n\np. 346\n\nand so on if meditated upon as udgitha and so on will themselves become of the\nnature of work and thereby be causes of fruit.--Moreover, the text, 'This\nearth is the _Ri_ _k_ , the fire is the Saman,' is followed by the\ncomplementary passage, 'this Saman is placed upon this _Ri_ _k_ ,' where the\nword ' _Ri_ _k_ ' denotes the earth and the word 'Saman' the fire. Now this\n(viz. this calling the earth ' _Ri_ _k_ ' and calling the fire 'Saman') is\npossible only if the meaning of the passage is that the earth and the fire\nhave to be viewed as _Ri_ _k_ and Saman; not if the _Ri_ _k_ and the Saman\nwere to be contemplated as earth and fire. For the term 'king' is\nmetaphorically applied to the charioteer--and not the term 'charioteer' to the\nking--the reason being that the charioteer may be viewed as a king.--Again in\nthe text, 'Let a man meditate upon the fivefold Saman in the world,.' the use\nof the locative case 'in the worlds' intimates that the meditation on the\nSaman is to be superimposed on the worlds as its locus. This is also proved by\nthe analogous passage, 'This Gayatra Saman is woven on the vital airs' ( _Kh_.\nUp. II, 11, 1).--Moreover (as proved before), in passages such as '\xc3\x82ditya is\nBrahman, this is the instruction.' Brahman, which is mentioned last, is\nsuperimposed on \xc3\x82ditya, which is mentioned first. In the same way the earth,\n&c., are mentioned first, and the hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara, &c., mentioned last in passages\nsuch as 'The earth is the hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara' ( _Kh_. Up. II. 2, i).--For all these\nreasons the idea of members of sacrificial action has to be transferred to\n\xc3\x82ditya and so on, which are not such members.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. The ideas of \xc3\x82ditya and so on are\nexclusively to be transferred to members of sacrificial action, such as the\nudgitha and so on. For what reason?--' On account of effectuation '--that\nmeans: Because thus, through their connexion with the supersensuous result (of\nthe sacrificial work under discussion), when the udgitha and so on are\nceremonially qualified by being viewed as \xc3\x82ditya and so on, the sacrificial\nwork is successful 1. A scriptural passage--viz. _Kh_. Up. I, 1.10,\n\np. 347\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Whatever one performs with knowledge, faith, and the\nUpanishad is more powerful'--moreover expressly declares that knowledge causes\nthe success of sacrificial work.--Well then, an objection is raised, let this\nbe admitted with regard to those meditations which have for their result the\nsuccess of certain works; but how is it with meditations that have independent\nfruits of their own? Of this latter nature is e.g. the meditation referred to\nin _Kh_. Up. II, 2, 3, 'He who knowing this meditates on the fivefold Saman in\nthe worlds (to him belong the worlds in an ascending and a descending scale).'\n--In those cases also, we reply, the meditation falls within the sphere of a\nperson entitled to the performance of a certain work, and therefore it is\nproper to assume that it has a fruit only through its connexion with the\nsupersensuous result of the work under the heading of which it is mentioned;\nthe case being analogous to that of the godohana-vessel 1.--And as \xc3\x82ditya and\nso on are of the nature of fruits of action, they may be viewed as superior to\nthe udgitha and so on which are of the nature of action only. Scriptural texts\nexpressly teach that the reaching of \xc3\x82ditya (the sun) and so on constitutes\nthe fruit of certain works.--Moreover the initial passages, 'Let a man\nmeditate on the syllable Om as the udgitha,' and 'Of this syllable the full\naccount is this' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 1, 1), represent the udgitha only as the\nobject of meditation, and only after that the\n\np. 348\n\ntext enjoins the contemplations on \xc3\x82ditya and so on.--Nor can we accept the\nremark that \xc3\x82ditya and so on being meditated upon as udgitha, &c., assume\nthereby the nature of work and thus will be productive of fruit. For pious\nmeditation is in itself of the nature of work, and thus capable of producing a\nresult. And if the udgitha and so on are meditated upon as \xc3\x82ditya, &c., they\ndo not therefore cease to be of the nature of work.--In the passage, 'This\nSaman is placed upon this _Ri_ _k_ ,' the words ' _Ri_ _k_ ' and 'Saman' are\nemployed to denote the earth and Agni by means of implication (laksha _n_ a),\nand implication may be based, according to opportunity, either on a less or\nmore remote connexion of sense. Although, therefore, the intention of the\npassage is to enjoin the contemplation of the _Ri_ _k_ and the Saman as earth\nand Agni, yet--as the _Ri_ _k_ and the Saman are mentioned separately and as\nthe earth and Agni are mentioned close by--we decide that, on the ground of\ntheir connexion with the _Ri_ _k_ and Saman, the words ' _Ri_ _k_ ' and\n'Saman' are employed to denote them (i.e. earth and Agni) only. For we also\ncannot altogether deny that the word 'charioteer' may, for some reason or\nother, metaphorically denote a king.--Moreover the position of the words in\nthe clause, 'Just this (earth) is _Ri_ _k_ ,' declares that the _Ri_ _k_ is of\nthe nature of earth; while if the text wanted to declare that the earth is of\nthe nature of _Ri_ _k_ , the words would be arranged as follows, 'this earth\nis just _Ri_ _k_ '--Moreover the concluding clause. 'He who knowing this sings\nthe Saman,' refers only to a cognition based on a subordinate member (of\nsacrificial action), not to one based on the earth and so on.--Analogously in\nthe passage, 'Let a man meditate (on) the fivefold Saman in the worlds,' the\nworlds--although enounced in the locative case--have to be superimposed on the\nSaman, as the circumstance of the 'Saman' being exhibited in the objective\ncase indicates it to be the object of meditation. For if the worlds are\nsuperimposed on the Saman, the Saman is meditated upon as the Self of the\nworlds; while in the opposite case the worlds would be meditated upon as the\nSelf of the Saman.--The same remark applies to the passage, 'This Gayatra\n\np. 349\n\n[paragraph continues] Saman is woven on the pra _n_ as' ( _Kh_. Up. II, 11,\n1).--Where again both members of the sentence are equally exhibited in the\nobjective case, viz. in the passage, 'Let a man meditate on the sevenfold\nSaman (as) the sun' ( _Kh_. Up. II, 9, 1), we observe that the introductory\npassages--viz. 'Meditation on the whole Saman is good;' 'Thus for the fivefold\nSaman;' 'Next for the sevenfold Saman' ( _Kh_. Up. II, 1, 1; 7, 2; 8,\n1)--represent the Saman only as the object of meditation, and therefrom\nconclude that \xc3\x82ditya has to be superinduced on it. and not the reverse.--From\nthis very circumstance of the Saman being the object of meditation, it follows\nthat even in cases where the two members of the sentence have a reverse\nposition--such as 'The earth (is) the hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara,' &c.--the hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara, &c., have to\nbe viewed as earth and so on; and not the reverse.--From all this it follows\nthat reflections based on things not forming constituent members of the\nsacrifice, such as \xc3\x82ditya and so on, are to be superimposed on the udgitha and\nthe like which are such constituent members.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[346:1](sbe38267.htm#fr_215) Certain constituent members of the sacrificial\naction--such as p. 347 the udgitha--undergo a certain ceremonial purification\n(sa _m_ skara) by being meditated upon as \xc3\x82ditya and so on. The meditations\ntherefore contribute, through the mediation of the constituent members,\ntowards the apurva, the supersensuous result of the entire sacrifice.\n\n[347:1](sbe38267.htm#fr_216) The sacred text promises a special fruit for the\nemployment of the milking-pail (instead of the ordinary _k_ amasa), viz. the\nobtainment of cattle; nevertheless that fruit is obtained only in so far as\nthe godohana subserves the accomplishment of the apurva of the sacrifice.\nAnalogously those meditations on members of sacrificial works for which the\ntext promises a separate fruit obtain that fruit only in so far as they effect\na mysterious sa _m_ skara in those members, and thereby subserve the apurva of\nthe sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 7](sbe38268.htm)\n\n"
