O Saint, be mine.  \nA wondrous jewel is thy cow,  \nAnd gems are for the monarch's brow. 1b  \nTo me her rightful lord resign  \nThis Dapple-skin thou callest thine.'  \n\nThe great Vas'ishtha, thus addressed,  \nArch-hermit of the holy breast,  \nTo Vis'vamitra answer made,  \nThe king whom all the land obeyed:  \nNot for a hundred thousand,--nay,  \nNot if ten million thou wouldst pay,  \nWith silver heaps the price to swell,--  \nWill I my cow, O Monarch, sell.  \nUnmeet for her is such a fate.  \nThat I my friend should alienate.  \nAs glory with the virtuous, she  \nFor ever makes her home with me.  \nOn her mine offerings which ascend  \nTo Gods and spirits all depend:  \nMy very life is due to her,  \nMy guardian, friend, and minister.  \n\np. 65  \n\nThe feeding of the sacred flame, 1  \nThe dole which living creatures claim. 2  \nThe mighty sacrifice by fire,  \nEach formula the rites require, 3  \nAnd various saving lore beside,  \nAre by her aid, in sooth, supplied.  \nThe banquet which thy host has shared,  \nBelieve it, was by her prepared.  \nIn her mine only treasures lie,  \nShe cheers mine heart and charms mine eye.  \nAnd reasons more could I assign  \nWhy Dapple-skin can ne'er be thine.'  \n\nThe royal sage, his suit denied,  \nWith eloquence more earnest cried:  \n'Tusked elephants, a goodly train,  \nEach with a golden girth and chain.  \nWhose goads with gold well fashioned shine--  \nOf these be twice seven thousand thine.  \nAnd four-horse cars with gold made bright,  \nWith steeds most beautifully white,  \nWhose bells make music as they go,  \nEight hundred, Saint, will I bestow.  \nEleven thousand mettled steeds  \nFrom famous lands, of noble breeds--  \nThese will I gladly give, O thou  \nDevoted to each holy vow.  \nTen million heifers, fair to view,  \nWhose sides are marked with every hue--  \nThese in exchange will I assign;  \nBut let thy Dapple-skin be mine.  \nAsk what thou wilt, and piles untold  \nOf priceless gems and gleaming gold,  \nO best of Brahmans, shall be thine;  \nBut let thy Dapple-skin be mine.'  \n\nThe great Vas'ishtha, thus addressed.  \nMade answer to the king's request:  \n'Ne'er will I give my cow away,  \nMy gem, my wealth, my life and stay.  \nMy worship at the moon's first show,  \nAnd at the full, to her I owe;  \nAnd sacrifices small and great,  \nWhich largess due and gifts await.  \nFrom her alone, their root, O King,  \n\nMy rites and holy service spring.  \nWhat boots it further words to say?  \nI will not give my cow away  \nWho yields me what I ask each day.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[64:1b](ry053.htm#fr_222) 'Of old hoards and minerals in the earth, the king\nis entitled to half by reason of his general protection, and because he is the\nlord paramount of the soil.'\n\n                              MANU, Book VIII. 39.\n\n[65:1](ry053.htm#fr_223) Ghi or clarified butter, 'holy oil,' being one of the\nessentials of sacrifice.\n\n[65:2](ry053.htm#fr_224) A Brahman had five principal duties to discharge\nevery day: study and teaching the Veda, oblations to the manes or spirits of\nthe departed, sacrifice to the Gods, hospitable offerings to men, and _a gift\nof food to all creatures_.
