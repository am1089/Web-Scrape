I.\n\nOf the dissolution of the world: the four ages: the decline of all things, and\ndeterioration of mankind, in the Kali age.\n\nMAITREYA.--You have narrated to me, illustrious sage, the creation of the\nworld, the genealogies of the patriarchs, the duration of the Manwantaras, and\nthe dynasties of princes, in detail. I am now desirous to hear from you an\naccount of the dissolution of the world, the season of total destruction, and\nthat which occurs at the expiration of a Kalpa 1.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Hear from me, Maitreya, exactly the circumstances of the end of all\nthings, and the dissolution that occurs either at the expiration of a Kalpa,\nor that which takes place at the close of the life of Brahma. A month of\nmortals is a day and night of the progenitors: a year of mortals is a day and\nnight of the gods. Twice a thousand aggregates of the four ages is a day and\nnight of Brahma 2. The four ages are the Krita, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali;\ncomprehending together twelve thousand years of the gods. There are infinite\nsuccessions of these four ages, of a similar description, the first of which\nis always called the Krita, and the last the Kali. In the first, the Krita, is\nthat age which is created by Brahma; in the last, which is the Kali age, a\ndissolution of the world occurs.\n\np. 622\n\nMAITREYA.--Venerable sir, you are able to give me a description of the nature\nof the Kali age, in which four-footed virtue 3 suffers total extinction.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Hear, Maitreya, an account of the nature of the Kali age,\nrespecting which you have inquired, and which is now close at hand.\n\nThe observance of caste, order, and institutes will not prevail in the Kali\nage, nor will that of the ceremonial enjoined by the Sama, Rik, and Yajur\nVedas. Marriages in this age will not be conformable to the ritual, nor will\nthe rules that connect the spiritual preceptor and his disciple be in force.\nThe laws that regulate the conduct of husband and wife will be disregarded,\nand oblations to the gods with fire no longer be offered. In whatever family\nhe may be born, a powerful and rich man will be held entitled to espouse\nmaidens of every tribe. A regenerate man will be initiated in any way\nwhatever, and such acts of penance as may be performed will be unattended by\nany results 4. Every text will be scripture that people choose to think so 5:\nall gods will be gods to them that worship them; and all orders of life will\nbe common alike to all persons. In the Kali age, fasting, austerity,\nliberality, practised according to the pleasure of those by whom they are\nobserved, will constitute righteousness. Pride of wealth will be inspired by\nvery insignificant possessions. Pride of beauty will be prompted by (no other\npersonal charm than fine) hair. Gold, jewels, diamonds, clothes, will all have\nperished, and then hair will be the only ornament with which women can\ndecorate themselves. Wives will desert their husbands, when they lose their\nproperty; and they only who are wealthy will be considered by women as their\nlords. He who gives away much money will be the master of men; and family\ndescent will no longer be a title\n\np. 623\n\nof supremacy. Accumulated treasures will be expended on (ostentatious)\ndwellings. The minds of men will be wholly occupied in acquiring wealth; and\nwealth will be spent solely on selfish gratifications. Women will follow their\ninclinations, and be ever fond of pleasure. Men will fix their desires upon\nriches, even though dishonestly acquired. No man will part with the smallest\nfraction of the smallest coin 6, though entreated by a friend. Men of all\ndegrees will conceit themselves to be equal with Brahmans. Cows will be held\nin esteem only as they supply milk 7. The people will be almost always in\ndread of dearth, and apprehensive of scarcity; and will hence ever be watching\nthe appearances of the sky: they will all live, like anchorets, upon leaves\nand roots and fruit, and put a period to their lives through fear of famine\nand want. In truth there will never be abundance in the Kali age, and men will\nnever enjoy pleasure and happiness. They will take their food without previous\nablution, and without worshipping fire, gods, or guests, or offering obsequial\nlibations to their progenitors. The women will be fickle, short of stature,\ngluttonous: they will have many children, and little means: scratching their\nheads with both hands, they will pay no attention to the commands of their\nhusbands or parents: they will be selfish, abject, and slatternly: they will\nbe scolds and liars: they will be indecent and immoral in their conduct, and\nwill ever attach themselves to dissolute men. Youths, although disregarding\nthe rules of studentship, will study the Vedas. Householders will neither\nsacrifice nor practise becoming liberality. Anchorets will subsist upon food\naccepted from rustics; and mendicants will be influenced by regard for friends\nand associates 8. Princes, instead of protecting, will plunder their subjects;\nand, under the pretext of levying customs, will rob merchants of their\nproperty. In\n\np. 624\n\nthe Kali age every one who has cars and elephants and steeds will be a Raja 9:\nevery one who is feeble will be a slave. Vai\xc5\x9byas will abandon agriculture and\ncommerce, and gain a livelihood by servitude or the exercise of mechanical\narts. \xc5\x9audras, seeking a subsistence by begging, and assuming the outward marks\nof religious mendicants, will become the impure followers of impious and\nheretical doctrines 10.\n\nOppressed by famine and taxation, men will desert their native lands, and go\nto those countries which are fit for coarser grains 11. The path of the Vedas\nbeing obliterated, and men having deviated into heresy, iniquity will\nflourish, and the duration of life will therefore decrease. In consequence of\nhorrible penances not enjoined by scripture, and of the vices of the rulers,\nchildren will die in their infancy. Women will bear children at the age of\nfive, six, or seven years; and men beget them when they are eight, nine, or\nten. A man will be grey when he is twelve; and no one will exceed twenty years\nof life 12. Men will possess little sense, vigour, or virtue, and will\ntherefore perish in a very brief period. In proportion as heresy extends, so,\nMaitreya, shall the progress of the Kali age be estimated by the wise. In\nproportion as the number of the pious, who adhere to the lessons of the Vedas,\ndiminishes--as the efforts of individuals who cultivate virtue relax--as the\nfirst of males becomes no longer the object of sacrifices--as respect for the\nteachers of the Vedas declines--and as regard is acknowledged for the\ndisseminators\n\np. 625\n\nof heresy--so may wise men note the augmented influence of the Kali age 13.\n\nIn the Kali age, Maitreya, men, corrupted by unbelievers, will refrain from\nadoring Vishn\xcc\x81u, the lord of sacrifice, the creator and lord of all; and will\nsay, "Of what authority are the Vedas? what are gods or Brahmans? what need is\nthere of purification with water?" Then will the clouds yield scanty rain:\nthen will the corn be light in ear, and the grain will be poor, and of little\nsap: garments will be mostly made of the fibres of the San 14: the principal\nof trees will be the Sami 15: the prevailing caste will be the \xc5\x9audra: millet\nwill be the more common grain: the milk in use will be chiefly that of goats:\nunguents will be made of Usira grass. The mother and father-in-law will be\nvenerated in place of parents; and a man\'s friends will be his brother-in-law,\nor one who has a wanton wife. Men will say, "Who has a father? who has a\nmother? each one is born according to his deeds:" and therefore they will look\nupon a wife\'s or husband\'s parents as their own. Endowed with little sense,\nmen, subject to all the infirmities of mind, speech, and body, will daily\ncommit sins; and every thing that is calculated to afflict beings, vicious,\nimpure, and wretched, will be generated in the Kali age. Then shall some\nplaces follow a separate duty 16, devoid of holy study, oblations to fire, and\ninvocations of the gods 17. Then, in the\n\np. 626\n\n[paragraph continues] Kali age, shall a man acquire by a trifling exertion as\nmuch eminence in virtue as is the result of arduous penance in the Krita age,\nor age of purity 18.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[621:1](vp156.htm#fr_1593) Two kinds of great or universal dissolution are\nhere intimated; one occurring at the end of a Kalpa, or day of Brahma, to\nwhich the term Upasanhriti is applied in the text, and \xc3\x81tyantika laya by the\ncommentator; and the other taking place at the end of the life of Brahma,\nwhich is termed a great or elemental dissolution: Maha pralaya and Prakrita\npralaya.\n\n[621:2](vp156.htm#fr_1594) These measures of time are more fully detailed in\nthe first book: see [p. 22](vp037.htm#page_22).\n\n[622:3](vp156.htm#fr_1595) This is an allusion to a popular notion,\noriginating probably with Manu: "In the Krita age the genius of truth and\nright stands firm on his four feet; but in the following ages he is deprived\nsuccessively of one foot," &c. I. 81, 82.\n\n[622:4](vp156.htm#fr_1596) \'Such an act is just what it is;\' that is, it may\nbe attended by inconvenience to the individual, but is utterly inefficacious\nfor the expiation of sin.\n\n[622:5](vp156.htm#fr_1597) Whether it is conformable or contradictory to the\nVedas and the law. The passage may be rendered also, \'The doctrine or dogma of\nany one soever will be scripture.\'\n\n[623:6](vp156.htm#fr_1598) He will not part with the half of the half of half\na Pan\xcc\x81a; that is, with ten Cowries; a Pan\xcc\x81a being equal to eighty Cowries, or\nsmall shells. Five Pan\xcc\x81as are equal to one Ana, or the sixteenth of a Rupee;\nand, at two shillings the Rupee, ten Cowries are equal to about one-seventh of\na farthing.\n\n[623:7](vp156.htm#fr_1599) They will be valued for their individual use only,\nnot from any notion of their generic sanctity.\n\n[623:8](vp156.htm#fr_1600) The Bhagavata has, "Religious students will be\nregardless of vows and purification; householders will beg, not give alms;\nanchorets will dwell in villages; and mendicants will be desirous of riches."\n\n[624:9](vp156.htm#fr_1601) That is, princes and warriors will be so no longer\nby virtue of their birth and caste.\n\n[624:10](vp156.htm#fr_1602) Most of the mendicant orders admit members without\ndistinction of caste; but probably Buddhists especially are here intended. The\nBhagavata repeatedly alludes to the diffusion of heretical doctrines and\npractices, the substitution of outward signs and marks for devotion, and the\nabandonment of the worship of Vishn\xcc\x81u. The \xc5\x9aaiva mendicant orders are probably\nthose especially in view. The same probably are intended by our text in the\nsubsequent allusion to unauthorized austerities, and sectarial marks.\n\n[624:11](vp156.htm#fr_1603) \'Gavedhuka (Coix barbata) and other bad sorts of\ngrain;\' Another reading is, \'Countries growing wheat, barley, and the like.\'\nBut to place wheat and barley amongst inferior grains, and to rank them lower\nthan rice, is a classification that could have occurred to a native of Bengal\nalone.\n\n[624:12](vp156.htm#fr_1604) The Vayu says three and twenty; the Bhagavata,\nfrom twenty to thirty.\n\n[625:13](vp156.htm#fr_1605) The complaints of the prevalence of heterodox\ndoctrines, and neglect of the practices of the Vedas, which recur in the\nBhagavata and our text, indicate a period of change in the condition of the\nHindu religion, which it would be important to verify. If reference is made to\nBuddhism, to which in some respects the allusions especially apply, it would\nprobably denote a period not long subsequent to the Christian era; but it is\nmore likely to be of a later date, or in the eighth and ninth centuries, when\n\xc5\x9aankara is said to have reformed a variety of corrupt practices, and given\nrise to others. See As. Res. vol. XVI. p. la.\n\n[625:14](vp156.htm#fr_1606) Crotolaria juncea.\n\n[625:15](vp156.htm#fr_1607) The silk cotton, Bombax heptaphylla.\n\n[625:16](vp156.htm#fr_1608) The expression Kwachil-loka, \'a certain place,\' is\nexplained by the commentator, Kikat\xcc\x81a, &c.; confirming the inference that\nBuddhism is especially aimed at in the previous passages; for Kikat\xcc\x81a, or\nsouth Behar, is the scene of \xc5\x9aakya\'s earliest and most successful labours.\n\n[625:17](vp156.htm#fr_1609) Several of the Puran\xcc\x81as contain allusions to the\ndegeneracy of the Kali age, p. 626 but none afford more copious details. The\ndescription in the Bhagavata is much shorter; that of the Vayu is much the\nsame, and employs many of the same verses and illustrations.\n\n[626:18](vp156.htm#fr_1610) This might be suspected of being said ironically,\nreferring to what had been just observed of places where a religion prevailed\nthat required neither study nor sacrifice. The commentator, however,\nunderstands it literally, and asserts that allusion is here made to the\nVaishn\xcc\x81ava faith, in which devotion to Vishn\xcc\x81u or Krishn\xcc\x81a, and the mere\nrepetition of his name, are equally efficacious in the Kali age with the\npenances and sacrifices of the preceding ages: therefore he concludes the\nKali, by this one property, is the best of all the ages. This interpretation\nis confirmed by the following chapter.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II](vp157.htm)\n\n'
