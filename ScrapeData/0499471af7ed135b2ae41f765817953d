The tree Madhus\xc5\xabdana,--whose firm root is Law, whose trunk is the Vedas,\nwhose abundant branches are the Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, whose flowers are sacrifices, and\nwhose fruit is liberation,--excels.\n\n2\\. In Naimi\xe1\xb9\xa3a, the field of the sleepless Ones, 1 the sages, Saunaka and\nothers, performed sacrifices for thousands of years to attain the Heaven-\nworld.\n\n3-5. Those sages once, in the morning,. having offered oblations to the\nsacrificial fire respectfully asked this of the revered S\xc5\xabta sitting there:--\n\nThe sages said: The happiness-giving path of the Shining Ones\n\np. 2\n\nhas been described by you. We now wish to hear about the fear-inspiring Way of\nYama; 1\n\nAlso of the miseries of the World of Change, 2 and the means of destroying its\npains. Please tell us correctly about the afflictions of this world and the\nother.\n\n6\\. Suta said: Listen then. I am willing to describe the way of Yama, very\ndifficult to tread, happiness-giving, to the virtuously inclined, misery-\ngiving to the sinful.\n\n7\\. As it was declared to Vainateya 3 by the Blessed Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, when asked; just\nso will I relate it, to remove your difficulties.\n\n8-9. Once, when the Blessed Hari, the Teacher, was sitting at ease in\nVaiku\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb8\xa5a, the son of Vinat\xc4\x81, 3 having bowed reverently, inquired:--\n\nGaru\xe1\xb8\x8da said: The Path of Devotion, of many forms, has been described to me by\nyou, and also, O Shining One, has been told the highest goal of the devotees.\n\n10\\. Now I wish to hear about the fearsome Way of Yama, along which is the\ntravelling, it is revealed, of those who turn away from devotion to Thee.\n\n11\\. The name of the Lord is easily pronounced, and the tongue is under\ncontrol. Fie, fie upon the wretched men who nevertheless go to hell!\n\np. 3\n\n12\\. Tell me, then, O Lord, to what condition the sinful come, and in what way\nthey obtain the miseries of the Way of Yama.\n\n13\\. The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O Lord of Birds, and I will describe the\nWay of Yama, terrible even to hear about, by which those who are sinful go in\nhell.\n\n14-16. O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, those who delight in sin, destitute of compassion and\nrighteousness, attached to the wicked, averse from the true scriptures and the\ncompany of the good,\n\nSelf-satisfied, unbending, intoxicated with the pride of wealth, having the\nungodly qualities, lacking the divine attributes,\n\nBewildered by many thoughts, enveloped in the net of delusion, revelling in\nthe enjoyments of the desire-nature,--fall into a foul hell.\n\n17\\. Those men who are intent upon wisdom go to the highest goal; the\nsinfully-inclined go miserably to the torments of Yama.\n\n18\\. Listen how the misery of this world accrues to the sinful, then how they,\nhaving passed through death, meet with torments.\n\n19\\. Having experienced the good or the bad actions, in accordance with his\nformer earning,--then, as the result of his 1 actions, some disease arises.\n\np. 4\n\n20\\. Powerful death, unexpectedly, like a serpent, approaches him stricken\nwith bodily and mental pain, yet anxiously hoping to live.\n\n21-24. Not yet tired of life, being cared for by his dependents, with his body\ndeformed through old age, nearing death, in the house,\n\nHe remains, like a house-dog, eating what is ungraciously placed before him,\ndiseased, with failing digestion, eating little, moving little,\n\nWith eyes turned up through loss of vitality, with tubes obstructed by phlegm,\nexhausted by coughing and difficult breathing, with the death rattle in his\nthroat,\n\nLying encircled by his sorrowing relatives; though being spoken to he does not\nanswer, being caught in the noose of death.\n\n25\\. In this condition, with mind busy with the support of his family, with\nsenses unconquered, swooning with intense pain he dies amidst his weeping\nrelatives.\n\n26\\. In this last moment, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, a divine vision arises,--all the worlds\nappear as one,--and he does not attempt to say anything.\n\n27\\. Then, at the destruction of the decayed senses and the numbing of the\nintelligence, the messengers of Yama come near and life departs.\n\n28\\. When the breath is leaving its place, the moment of dying\n\np. 5\n\nseems an age, and pain like the stinging of hundred scorpions is experienced.\n\n29\\. Now he emits foam; his mouth becomes filled with saliva. The vital\nbreaths of the sinful depart by the lower gateway.\n\n30-31. Then, two terrifying messengers of Yama are come, of fierce aspect,\nbearing nooses and rods, naked, with grinding teeth,\n\nAs black as crows, with hair erect, with ugly faces, with nails like weapons;\nseeing whom his heart palpitates and he releases excrements.\n\n32\\. The man of the size of a thumb, crying out \'oh, oh,\' is dragged from the\nbody by the servants of Yama, looking the while at his own body.\n\n33\\. Having put round him a body of torment, and bound the noose about his\nneck, they forcibly lead him a long way, like the king\'s officers a convict.\n\n34-35. While thus leading him the messengers menace him, and recount over and\nover again the awful terrors of the hells,--\n\n\'Hurry up, you wicked man. You shall go to the abode of Yama. We will lead you\nnow, without delay, to Kumbh\xc4\xabp\xc4\x81ka and the other hells.\'\n\n36\\. Then hearing these words, and the weeping of his relatives; crying loudly\n\'Oh, oh,\' he is beaten by the servants of Yama.\n\np. 6\n\n37-38. With failing heart and shuddering at their threats, bitten by clogs\nupon the way, afflicted, remembering his misdeeds,\n\nHungry and thirsty, roasting in the sun, forest-fires and hot winds, struck\nupon the back with whips, painfully he walks, almost powerless, along a road\nof burning sand, shelterless and waterless.\n\n30-40. Here and there falling exhausted and insensible, and rising again,--in\nthis way, very miserably led through the darkness to the abode of Yama,\n\nThe man is brought there in a short time and the messengers show him the\nterrible torments of hell.\n\n41\\. Having seen the fearful Yama, the man, after a time, by command of Yama,\nswiftly comes back through the air, with the messengers.\n\n42\\. Having returned, bound by his past tendencies, desiring the body but held\nback with a noose by the followers of Yama, tortured by hunger and thirst, he\nweeps.\n\n43\\. He obtains the rice-balls given by his offspring, and the gifts made\nduring the time of his illness. Nevertheless, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, the sinful Denier\ndoes not obtain gratification.\n\n44\\. The \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha, 1 the gifts, and the handsful of water, for the sinful, do\nnot uplift. Although they eat the rice-ball offering, still they are tortured\nwith hunger.\n\np. 7\n\n45\\. Those who are in the departed condition, deprived of the rice-ball\noffering, wander about in great misery, in an uninhabited forest, until the\nend of the age.\n\n46\\. Karma not experienced does not die away even in thousands of millions of\nages; the being who has not experienced the torment certainly does not obtain\nthe human form.\n\n47\\. Hence, O Twice-born, 1 for ten days the son should offer rice-balls.\nEvery day these are divided into four portions, O Best of Birds.\n\n48\\. Two portions give nourishment to the five elements of the body; the third\ngoes to the messengers of Yama; he lives upon the fourth.\n\n40\\. For nine days and nights the departed obtains rice-balls, and on the\ntenth day the being, with fully formed body, acquires strength.\n\n50\\. The old body being cremated, a new one is formed by these offerings, O\nBird; the man, the size of a hand (cubit), by this experiences good and evil\non the way.\n\n51-53. By the rice-ball of the first day the head is-formed; the neck and\nshoulders by the second; by the third the heart forms:\n\nBy the fourth the back forms; and by the fifth the navel; by the sixth the\nhips and secret parts; by the seventh the thigh forms;\n\np. 8\n\nLikewise next the knees and feet by two; on the tenth day hunger and thirst.\n\n54\\. Dwelling in the body formed by the rice-balls, very hungry and pained\nwith thirst, on both the eleventh and twelfth days the departed eats.\n\n55\\. On the thirteenth day the departed, bound by the servants of Yama, walks\nalone along the road like a captured monkey.\n\n56\\. The extent of the way of Yama measures eighty-six thousand Yojanas, 1\nwithout Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab, O Bird.\n\n57\\. Two hundred and forty-seven Yojanas each day the departed travels, going\nby day and night.\n\n58-59. Having passed successively. through these sixteen cities on the way,\nthe sinful man goes to the place of the King of Righteousness 2:--\n\nSaumya, 3 Sauripura, 4 N\xc4\x81gendrabhavana, 5 G\xc4\x81ndharva, 6 Shail\xc4\x81gama, 7 Krauncha,\n8 Kr\xc5\xabrapura, 9 Vichitrabhavana, 10 Bahw\xc4\x81pada, 11 Du\xe1\xb8\xa5khada, 12 N\xc4\x81n\xc4\x81krandapura,\n13 Sutaptabhawana, 14 Raudra, 15 Payovarshana, 16 Sh\xc4\xabt\xc4\x81dhya, 17 Bahubh\xc4\xabti\n18:--before the city of Yama, the abode of righteousness\n\np. 9\n\n60\\. Held by the nooses of Yama, the sinful, crying out "Oh, oh," having left\nhis own house, goes on the way to the city of Yama.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](gpu03.htm#fr_2) _I.e._ , The superphysical beings, who do not sleep.\n\n[2:1](gpu03.htm#fr_3) Yama is the Lord of death.\n\n[2:2](gpu03.htm#fr_4) Sa\xe1\xb9\x81s\xc4\x81ra: The three worlds in which men circle through\nbirths and deaths.\n\n[2:3](gpu03.htm#fr_6) A name of Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da, Vinat\xc4\x81 was the mother of Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da.\n\n[3:1](gpu03.htm#fr_7) The ambiguity of the pronouns in this work is\nunavoidable, They may be interpreted only with the aid of common-sense.\n\n[6:1](gpu03.htm#fr_8) Ceremony for the dead.\n\n[7:1](gpu03.htm#fr_9) Members of the three higher castes take a "second birth"\nwhen invested with the sacred thread; all birds are twice-born, in and from\nthe egg.\n\n[8:1](gpu03.htm#fr_10) A Yojana is between 8 and 9 miles.\n\n[8:2](gpu03.htm#fr_11) Another form of Yama.\n\n[8:3](gpu03.htm#fr_12) Calm place.\n\n[8:4](gpu03.htm#fr_13) Town of Saturn.\n\n[8:5](gpu03.htm#fr_14) Residence of the Lord of Serpents.\n\n[8:6](gpu03.htm#fr_15) Place of Singers.\n\n[8:7](gpu03.htm#fr_16) Inaccessible mountain.\n\n[8:8](gpu03.htm#fr_17) Name of a mountain.\n\n[8:9](gpu03.htm#fr_18) Town of cruelty.\n\n[8:10](gpu03.htm#fr_19) A wonderful place.\n\n[8:11](gpu03.htm#fr_20) Many calamities.\n\n[8:12](gpu03.htm#fr_21) Misery-giving.\n\n[8:13](gpu03.htm#fr_22) Town of varied cries.\n\n[8:14](gpu03.htm#fr_23) Very hot place.\n\n[8:15](gpu03.htm#fr_24) Savage.\n\n[8:16](gpu03.htm#fr_25) Rains\n\n[8:17](gpu03.htm#fr_26) Very cold.\n\n[8:18](gpu03.htm#fr_27) Many horrors.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II.
