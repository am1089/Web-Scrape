Bhu, Bhuvas, Suvas 4, these are the three sacred interjections (vyah _ri_\nti). Maha _k_ amasya taught a fourth, viz. Mahas, which is Brahman, which is\nthe Self. The others (devatas) are its members.\n\nBhu is this world, Bhuvas is the sky, Suvas is the other world.\n\n2\\. Mahas is the sun. All the worlds are increased by the sun. Bhu is Agni\n(fire), Bhuvas is Vayu (air), Suvas is \xc3\x82ditya (sun). Mahas is the moon. All\nthe heavenly lights are increased by the moon.\n\np. 49\n\nBhu is the _Ri_ _k_ -verses, Bhuvas is the Saman-verses, Suvas is the Ya _g_\nus-verses.\n\n3\\. Mahas is Brahman. All the Vedas are increased by the Brahman.\n\n(1-2) Bhu is Pra _n_ a (up-breathing), Bhuvas is Apana, (down-breathing),\nSuvas is Vyana (back-breathing). Mahas is food. All breathings are increased\nby food.\n\nThus there are these four times four, the four and four sacred interjections.\nHe who knows these,\n\n(1-2) Knows the Brahman. All Devas bring offerings to him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[48:1](sbe15025.htm#fr_203) The construction is not right.
