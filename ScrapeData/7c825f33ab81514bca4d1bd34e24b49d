Verily, even as this cart-wheel, or a potter's wheel, would creak\n1 if not steadied, so, indeed, were these worlds unfirm and unsteadied.\n\n11:8:1:22\\. Pra _g_ apati then bethought him, 'How may these worlds become\nfirm and steadied?' By means of the mountains and rivers he stablished this\n(earth), by means of the birds and sun-motes 2 the air, and by means of the\nclouds and stars the sky.\n\n11:8:1:33\\. He then exclaimed, 'Wealth!'--now, wealth 3 (mahas) means cattle,\nwhence they (cattle) thrive (mahiyante 4) exceedingly in the homestead of one\nwho possesses many of them; and this (Sacrificer), indeed, possesses many of\nthem, and in his homestead they do thrive exceedingly. Wherefore, if people\nwere either to forcibly drive him from his home, or to bid him go forth, let\nhim, after performing the Agni-hotra, approach (the fires) saying, 'Wealth';\nand he becomes firmly established by offspring and cattle, and is not deprived\nof his home.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[126:1](sbe44041.htm#fr_390) Saya _n_ a apparently takes 'krand' in the sense\nof 'to shake, or wabble,'--'even as a cart-wheel or some other wheel, not\nstanding on the ground for want of the wooden rest (alambana-kash _th_ a,?\naxle-pin) or some other thing, would wabble (hvalet).' What Saya _n_ a means\nto say, probably, is that the verb used by the author expresses the effect of\nthe action intended.\n\n[126:2](sbe44041.htm#fr_391) Or, sun-beams (ra _s_ mi), as Saya _n_ a takes\n'mari _k_ i'; cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 9, note.\n\n[126:3](sbe44041.htm#fr_392) Or, joy;--cp. II, 3, 4, 25, which would seem to\nbe the passage referred to in the present paragraph.\n\n[126:4](sbe44041.htm#fr_393) Or, perhaps, 'they enjoy themselves, gambol,' as\nthe St. Petersb. Dict. takes it. Differently, again, Saya _n_ a,--yata ebhi\n_h_ pa _s_ ubhir mahiyate (he thrives?), ata ete maha _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 8, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe44042.htm)\n\n"
