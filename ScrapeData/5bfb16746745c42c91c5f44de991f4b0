The\nbrothers were married, but their wives did not do the cooking for the family.\nIt was done by their sister, who stopped at home to cook. The wives for this\nreason bore their sister-in-law much ill-will, and at length they combined\ntogether to oust her from the office of cook and general provider, so that one\nof themselves might obtain it. They said, "She does not go out to the fields\nto work, but remains quietly at home, and yet she has not the meals ready at\nthe proper time." They then called upon their Bonga, and vowing vows unto them\nthey secured his good-will and assistance; then they said to the Bonga, "At\nmidday, when our sister-in-law goes to bring, water, cause it thus to happen,\nthat on seeing her pitcher, the water shall vanish, and again slowly reappear.\nIn this way she will be delayed. Let the water not flow into her pitcher, and\nyou may keep the maiden as your own."\n\nAt noon, when she went to bring water, it suddenly dried up before her, and\nshe began to weep. Then after a while the water began slowly to rise. When it\nreached her ankles she tried to fill her pitcher, but it would not go under\nthe water. Being frightened, she began to wail and cry to her brother:\n\n"Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my ankles,  \nStill, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."\n\nThe water continued to rise until it reached her knee, when she began to wail\nagain:\n\n"Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my knee,  \nStill, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."\n\nThe water continued to rise, and when it reached her waist, she cried again:\n\n"Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my waist,  \nStill, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."\n\nThe water still rose, and when it reached her neck she kept on crying:\n\n"Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my neck,  \nStill, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."\n\nAt length the water became so deep that she felt herself drowning, then she\ncried aloud:\n\n"Oh! my brother, the water measures a man\'s height,  \nOh! my brother, the pitcher begins to fill."\n\nThe pitcher filled with water, and along with it she sank and was drowned. The\nBonga then transformed her into a Bonga like himself, and carried her off.\n\nAfter a time she reappeared as a bamboo growing on the embankment of the tank\nin which she had been drowned. When the bamboo had grown to an immense size, a\nJogi, who was in the habit of passing that way, seeing it, said to himself,\n"This will make a splendid fiddle." So one day he brought an axe to cut it\ndown; but when he was about to begin, the bamboo called out, "Do not cut at\nthe root, cut higher up." When he lifted his axe to cut high up the stem, the\nbamboo cried out, "Do not cut near the top, cut at the root." When the Jogi\nagain prepared himself to cut at the root as requested, the bamboo said, "Do\nnot cut at the root, cut higher up;" and when he was about to cut higher up,\nit again called out to him, "Do not cut high up, cut at the root." The Jogi by\nthis time felt sure that a Bonga was frying to frighten him, so becoming angry\nhe cut down the bamboo at the root, and taking it away made a fiddle out of\nit. __ The instrument had a superior tone and delighted all who heard it. The\nJogi carried it with him when he went a-begging, and through the influence of\nits sweet music he returned home every evening with a full wallet.\n\nHe now and then visited, when on his rounds, the house of the Bonga girl\'s\nbrothers, and the strains of the fiddle affected them greatly. Some of them\nwere moved even to tears, for the fiddle seemed to wail as one in bitter\nanguish. The elder brother wished to purchase it, and offered to support the\nJogi for a whole year if he would consent to part with his wonderful\ninstrument. The Jogi, however, knew its value, and refused to sell it. It so\nhappened that the Jogi some time after went to the house of a village chief,\nand after playing a tune or two on his fiddle asked for something to eat. They\noffered to buy his fiddle and promised a high price for it, but he refused to\nsell it, as his fiddle brought to him his means of livelihood. When they saw\nthat he was not to be prevailed upon, they gave him food and a plentiful\nsupply of liquor. Of the latter he drunk so freely that he presently became\nintoxicated. While he was in this condition, they took away his fiddle, and\nsubstituted their own old one for it. When the Jogi recovered, he missed his\ninstrument, and suspecting that it had been stolen asked them to return it to\nhim. They denied having taken it, so he had to depart leaving his fiddle\nbehind him. The chief\'s son, being a musician, used to play on the Jogi\'s\nfiddle, and in his hands the music it gave forth delighted the ears of all who\nheard it.\n\nWhen all the household were absent at their labours in the fields, the Bonga\ngirl used to come out of the bamboo fiddle, and prepared the family meal.\nHaving eaten her own share, she placed that of the chief\'s son under his bed,\nand covering it up to keep off the dust, re-entered the fiddle. This happening\nevery day, the other members of the house-hold thought that some girl friend\nof theirs was in this manner showing her interest in the young man, so they\ndid not trouble themselves to find out how it came about. The young chief,\nhowever, was determined to watch, and see which of his girl friends was so\nattentive to his comfort. He said in his own mind, "I will catch her to-day,\nand give her a sound beating; she is causing me to be ashamed before the\nothers." So saying, he hid himself in a corner in a pile of firewood. In a\nshort time the girl came out of the bamboo fiddle and began to dress her hair.\nHaving completed her toilet, she cooked the meal of rice as usual, and having\neaten some herself, she placed the young man\'s portion under his bed, as\nbefore, and was about to enter the fiddle again, when he, running out from his\nhiding-place, caught her in his arms. The Bonga girl exclaimed, "Fie! Fie! you\nmay be a Don, or you maybe a Hadi of some other caste with whom I cannot\nmarry." He said, "No. But from to-day, you and I are one." So they began\nlovingly to hold converse with each other. When the others returned home in\nthe evening, they saw that she was both a human being and a Bonga, and they\nrejoiced exceedingly. Now in course of time the Bonga girl\'s family became\nvery poor, and her brothers on one occasion came to the chiefs house on a\nvisit.\n\nThe Bonga girl recognised them at once, but they did not know who she was. She\nbrought them water on their arrival, and afterwards set cooked rice before\n\'them. Then sitting down near them, she began in wailing tones to upbraid them\non account of the treatment she had been subjected to by their wives. She\nrelated all that had befallen her, and wound up by saying," You must have\nknown it all, and yet you did not interfere to save me." And that was all the\nrevenge she took.\n\n[![](tn/24.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/24.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Cruel Crane Outwitted](ift08.htm)\n\n'
