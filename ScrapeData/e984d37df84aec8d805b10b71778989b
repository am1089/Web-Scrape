And when the Brahman sings a Saman on the cart-wheel set up on (a post)\nreaching to his navel, he thereby wins the air-world. And when he erects the\nsacrificial post, he thereby wins the world of the gods. Hence that threefold\nperformance.\n\n5:1:5:22\\. The Brahman mounts a cart-wheel, set up on (a post) as high as his\nnavel 2, with (Va _g_. S. IX, 10),\n\np. 23\n\n[paragraph continues] 'At the impulse (sava) of the god Savit _ri_ , of true\nimpulsion, may I ascend unto the highest heaven of B _ri_ haspati!' thus, if a\nBrahma _n_ a sacrifices; for B _ri_ haspati is the Brahman (priesthood, or\nsanctity), and the Brahma _n_ a is the Brahman.\n\n5:1:5:33\\. And if a Ra _g_ anya sacrifices, (he does so) with, 'At the impulse\nof the divine Savit _ri_ , of true impulsion, may I ascend unto the highest\nheaven of Indra!' for Indra is the Kshatra (nobility, or power), and the Ra\n_g_ anya is the Kshatra.\n\n5:1:5:44\\. Thrice he sings the Saman 1. Having thrice sung it, he descends\nwith, 'At the impulse of the divine Savit _ri_ , of true impulsion, I have\nascended unto the highest heaven of B _ri_ haspati!'--thus, if a Brahma _n_ a\nsacrifices, for B _ri_ haspati is the Brahman, and the Brahma _n_ a is the\nBrahman.\n\n5:1:5:55\\. And if a Ra _g_ anya sacrifices,--with, 'At the impulse of the\ndivine Savit _ri_ , of true impulsion, I have ascended unto the highest heaven\nof Indra!' for Indra is the Kshatra, and the Ra _g_ anya is the Kshatra.\n\n5:1:5:66\\. They put up seventeen drums along the edge of the altar, from the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra backwards (towards\n\np. 24\n\nthe west); for he who offers the Va _g_ apeya wins Pra _g_ apati; but Pra _g_\napati is speech, and that doubtless is the supreme speech which is (the\noutcome) of seventeen drums: he thus wins the supreme speech, the supreme Pra\n_g_ apati. Seventeen there are, because Pra _g_ apati is seventeenfold: he\nthus wins Pra _g_ apati.\n\n5:1:5:77\\. One of these drums he (the Brahman) beats (while praying) with a\nsacrificial formula: thereby all of them become beaten with a sacrificial\nformula.\n\n5:1:5:88\\. He beats it with (Va _g_. S. IX, 11), 'O B _ri_ haspati, win the\nrace! lift ye up your voice unto B _ri_ haspati: make ye B _ri_ haspati win\nthe race!' thus, if a Brahma _n_ a sacrifices; for B _ri_ haspati is the\nBrahman, and the Brahma _n_ a is the Brahman.\n\n5:1:5:99\\. And if a Ra _g_ anya sacrifices, (he does so) with, 'O Indra, win\nthe race! lift ye up your voice unto Indra: make ye Indra win the race!' for\nIndra is the Kshatra, and the Ra _g_ anya is the Kshatra.\n\n5:1:5:1010\\. And when those race-running chariots 1 have come up again, he\ntakes down one of those drums with a sacrificial formula; whereby they all\nbecome taken down with a formula.\n\n5:1:5:1111\\. He takes it down, with (Va _g_. S. I X, 12), 'This hath been your\ntrue concord whereby ye (drums) have caused B _ri_ haspati to win the race;--B\n_ri_ haspati ye have caused to win the race: be released, ye wood-lords!'\nthus, if a Brahma _n_ a\n\np. 25\n\nsacrifices; for B _ri_ haspati is the Brahman, and the Brahma _n_ a is the\nBrahman.\n\n5:1:5:1212\\. And if a Ra _g_ anya sacrifices, with, 'This hath been your true\nconcord whereby ye have caused Indra to twin the race;--Indra ye have caused\nto win the race: be released, ye wood-lords!' for Indra is the Kshatra, and\nthe Ra _g_ anya is the Kshatra.\n\n5:1:5:1313\\. A Ra _g_ anya then 1 shoots seventeen arrow's ranges northwards\nfrom the edge of the altar; for as much as is one arrow's range, so much is\nPra _g_ apati crosswise; and as much as are seventeen arrow's ranges, so much\nis Pra _g_ apati lengthwise.\n\n5:1:5:1414\\. And as to why a Ra _g_ anya shoots,--he, the Ra _g_ anya is most\nmanifestly of Pra _g_ apati (the lord of creatures): hence, while being one,\nhe rules over many; and because 'pra _g_ apati' has four syllables, and 'ra\n_g_ anya 2' also has four syllables, therefore a Ra _g_ anya shoots. He shoots\nseventeen arrow's ranges, because Pra _g_ apati is seventeenfold: he thereby\nwins Pra _g_ apati.\n\n5:1:5:1515\\. And whichever (horse) he yokes with a formula, up to that the\nSacrificer now steps 3, with (Va _g_. S. IX, 13), 'At the impulse of the\ndivine Savit _ri_ ,\n\np. 26\n\nof true impulsion, may I win the race of the race-winning B _ri_ haspati!'\n\n5:1:5:1616\\. And even as then B _ri_ haspati hasted up to Savit _ri_ for his\nimpulsion,--Savit _ri_ being the impeller among the gods--saying, 'Impel this\nfor me: impelled by thee, may I win this!' and Savit _ri_ , as the impeller,\nimpelled it for him, and impelled by Savit _ri_ , he won; in like manner does\nhe thereby haste up to Savit _ri_ for his impulsion,--Savit _ri_ being the\nimpeller among the gods,--saying, 'Impel this for me: impelled by thee, may I\nwin!' and Savit _ri_ , as the impeller, impels it for him, and impelled by\nSavit _ri_ he wins.\n\n5:1:5:1717\\. And if a pupil of the Adhvaryu's or some (other) theological\nstudent were to know that prayer, stepping up he makes (the Sacrificer) say,\n'O coursers!'--for horses are indeed coursers: therefore he says, 'O\ncoursers'--'wealth-winners!' for wealth is food: 'food-winners' he thereby\nsays;--'keeping the roads,' for they indeed run keeping (within) the\nroads;--'measuring the stages;' for measuring the stages they run over the\ncourse;--'go ye to the winning-post!' In order that the evil-doers, the\nRakshas, may not hurt them midways, he thus says this.--They run the race,\nthey beat the drums, and he (the Brahman) sings the Saman.\n\n5:1:5:1818\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then 1 either offers or addresses (the horses)\nwith those two _g_ agati-verses: whether he offers, or whether he addresses\n(the\n\np. 27\n\nhorses), the significance (of the performance) is the same.\n\n5:1:5:1919\\. He offers, with (Va _g_. S. IX, 14; _Ri_ k S. IV, 40, 4), 'That\ncourser speedeth after the whip, fettered at the neck and shoulder and mouth:\nmay Dadhikra win according to his power; may he run along the windings of the\nroads, hail!'\n\n5:1:5:2020\\. [Va _g_. S. IX, 15; _Ri_ k S. IV, 40, 3], 'And of him, the\nrunning, speeding, there fanneth like the wing of the eager bird,--as of the\ngliding eagle,--about the breast of Dadhikravan passing along with might,\nhail!'\n\n5:1:5:2121\\. He then either offers or addresses (the horses) with the\nfollowing tristich: this is twofold, because he either offers or addresses.\nWhether he offers, or addresses (the horses), the significance is the same: he\nthereby speeds those running horses, imbues them with energy. There are here\nthree earths, namely this one, and two beyond it: these he thereby wins.\n\n5:1:5:2222\\. He addresses (the horses, with Va _g_. S. IX, 16; _Ri_ k S. VII,\n38, 7), 'Auspicious be the coursers unto us at the invocations in the divine\nservice, running their measured course, with beautiful song; swallowing the\ndragon, the wolf, the evil spirits: may they ever keep away from us\naffliction!'\n\n5:1:5:2323\\. [Va _g_. S. IX, 17; _Ri_ k S. X, 64, 6], 'Those racers, wont to\nhear the calls, may they all hear our call, the coursers running their\nmeasured course: they, the winners of thousands, eager to win at the winning\nof oblations, who have carried off great gain in the contests.'\n\n5:1:5:2424\\. [Va _g_. S. IX, 18; _Ri_ k S. VII, 38, 8], 'In\n\np. 28\n\nevery race, help us, ye racers, at the prizes, ye wise, immortal knowers of\nthe divine law: drink of this mead, be gladdened, and satisfied walk ye on the\npaths trodden by the gods!'\n\n5:1:5:2525\\. He then 1 steps over against (the horses) with the Barhaspatya\npap, and touches it; for he who offers the Va _g_ apeya wins food, since 'va\n_g_ a-peya' is the same as 'anna-peya:' whatever food he has thus gained that\nhe now, having reached that goal, brings in contact with himself, puts within\nhimself.\n\n5:1:5:2626\\. He touches it, with (Va _g_. S. IX, 19), 'May gain of wealth come\nto me!' wealth means food: he thus says, 'May gain of food come (accrue) to\nme;'--'May these two, Heaven and Earth, the all-shaped, come to me!' for Pra\n_g_ apati is Heaven and Earth;--'May father and mother come to me!' for Pra\n_g_ apati is both father and mother;--'May Soma come to me with immortality!'\nfor Pra _g_ apati is Soma.\n\n5:1:5:2727\\. He makes the horses smell it, with, 'Ye coursers!' for horses are\ncoursers: therefore he says, 'Ye coursers! wealth-winners!' wealth is food:\n'food-winners' he thereby says;--'having run the course--' for 'starting (upon\nthe course)' he said before, as then they were indeed starting; but now he\nsays, 'having run,' for they indeed have run (the race): therefore he says,\n'having run;'--'smell ye B _ri_ haspati's portion--' for this is B _ri_\nhaspati's portion: therefore he says, 'Smell ye B _ri_ haspati's\nportion;'--'taking (it) in!' whereby. he imbues the Sacrificer with energy.\nAnd as to why\n\np. 29\n\nhe makes the horses smell,--he made them smell before, thinking, 'May I win\nthis (world);' and now (he does so) thinking, 'I have won this (world) that is\nwhy he makes the horses smell.\n\n5:1:5:2828\\. Now on one of those race-running (rival) chariots there has been\nstanding either a Vai _s_ ya, or a Ra _g_ anya; he now sits down on the\nnorthern hip of the altar. Thereupon the Adhvaryu and Sacrificer, taking the\nhoney-cup, step out by the front, door (of the cart-shed), and place it in the\nVai _s_ ya's, or Ra _g_ anya's, hand. And the Nesh _t_ _ri_ , taking the cups\nof Sura, steps out by the back door. He walks round by the back of the hall,\nand placing one (of the cups) in the Vai _s_ ya's, or Ra _g_ anya's, hand, he\nsays, 'With this I buy Him of thee!' For the Soma is truth, prosperity, light;\nand the Sura is untruth, misery, darkness: he thus imbues the Sacrificer with\ntruth, prosperity, and light; and smites the Vai _s_ ya with untruth, misery,\nand darkness;--whatever benefit (or enjoyment) he desires, he obtains for\nhimself by those (cups of Sura). But that cup of honey he presents to the\nBrahman, together with the golden vessel. In presenting it to the Brahman, he\nimbues himself with immortal life; for gold is immortal life;--and whatsoever\nbenefit he desires that he thereby obtains for himself.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[22:2](sbe4107.htm#fr_64) According to the Taittiriya ritualists, as quoted by\nSaya _n_ a (Taitt. S. I, 7, 8), the wheel after being mounted by the Brahman\nis to be turned round thrice in a sunwise motion;--the (pointed) end of the\npost being apparently inserted in the navel of the wheel, lying horizontally\nupon it. The turning wheel is there compared with the Va _g_ ra, or disk-\nshaped thunderbolt. While the wheel is turning round its axle, the Brahman\nsings the Saman. Cf. also La _t_ y. _S_ r. V, 12, 9 seq., according to which\nauthority, however, the Brahman p. 23 would seem only to put his arms on the\nwheel, and turn it round, while singing.\n\n[23:1](sbe4107.htm#fr_65) Viz. the 'va _g_ ina _m_ saman' (Ta _n_ _d_ y. Br.\n18; 7, 12), Samav. I, 435 'avir marya a va _g_ am va _g_ ino agman,' &c. 'The\nfiery steeds have gathered fiery mettle, the impulse of the god Savit _ri_ ;\nwin ye the heaven, O coursers!' La _t_ y. _S_ r. V, 12, 14. This singing of\nthe Saman takes place while the race lasts, the Brahman remaining all the time\non the cart-wheel put up on a short post on (or near) the utkara, or heap of\nrubbish.--The author then anticipates in this and the next two paragraphs what\nthe Brahman is to do when he descends from the wheel after the race is over.\nThe placing of the drums next referred to must also be imagined as taking\nplace whilst the Brahman is mounting the wheel.\n\n[24:1](sbe4107.htm#fr_66) Besides the Sacrificer's chariot inside the vedi,\nsixteen others, each drawn by four horses, have been got ready, outside the\nvedi, for the race to the udumbara branch, as its goal and turning-point. In\nparagraphs [10](sbe4107.htm#5:1:5:10)-[12](sbe4107.htm#5:1:5:12) the author\nagain anticipates what is to be done with the drums after the race has taken\nplace, just in order to deal with that item of the ceremonial as a whole.\n\n[25:1](sbe4107.htm#fr_67) That is, after (or at the same time when) the drums\nare put up. He is to shoot northwards through the space between the utkara and\n_k_ atvala. At the end of the seventeenth arrow's range he plants an udumbara\nbranch in the ground to serve as the goal round which the chariots are to turn\nsunwise on their way back to the sacrificial ground.\n\n[25:2](sbe4107.htm#fr_68) Pronounce 'ra- _g_ a-ni-a.'\n\n[25:3](sbe4107.htm#fr_69) In the Taittiriya ritual (Taitt. S. I, 7, 7, 2;\nTaitt. Br. I, 3, 5, 4) the Sacrificer steps up to the chariot with the three\nVish _n_ u-strides, with appropriate formulas.\n\n[26:1](sbe4107.htm#fr_70) That is, he does so whilst the cars are running; the\noffering or prayers being intended to make the Sacrificer's car win the race.\n\n[28:1](sbe4107.htm#fr_71) That is, after the cars have come back, that of the\nSacrificer keeping ahead of the others.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 2, 1.
