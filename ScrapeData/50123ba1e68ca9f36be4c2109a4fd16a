His step-mother, Kaikeyi, however had another\nplan, one which she had held for many years.\n\nOnce when the King was sick, Kaikeyi acted as his nurse and as a reward, for\nso faithfully caring for him, the King told her she could ask three boons of\nhim; could ask for whatever she wanted.\n\nUpon being told that, Kaikeyi immediately asked the King to marry her. He did\nthis at once and asked what her other boon might be. To which she replied, "at\na future date I shall ask you." To this the king readily agreed, never\ndreaming what could be in her mind.\n\np. 180\n\nShe then bore a son whom she named Bharath.\n\nYears passed and the King being old in years, decided to retire and according\nto his wish everything was in readiness for Sri Ram to take the duty of\nruling.\n\nBut as Kaikeyi wanted her own son, instead of Sri Ram to be King, she reminded\nher husband (the King) of his promised boon. She then requested him, to exile\nSri Ram for twelve years. This was a surprise to the King, as he and the\npeople wished that Sri Ram should rule, so he refused her request.\n\nSri Ram, desirous that his father should keep his promise to Kaikeyi,\nvoluntarily went into banishment. This was much against his father\'s and the\npeople\'s will, but Sri Ram made it quite clear that this was the best course,\nand started on his exile. His wife, Sita, who stands above all women, in the\nhearts of every Hindu, followed him; also his brother Lashman.\n\nWhen his step-brother, Bharath, who was not home at the time, learned from\nKaikeyi, how she had procured the crown for him, he cried, "O, cruel and\nunjust woman, you have sent my brother\n\np. 181\n\ninto exile. I shall never wear the crown and from now on, do not call me son."\n\nGood Bharath loved his step-brother and at once set out to the country to find\nhim, to try and persuade him to return to his home and rule over the kingdom.\nHis cruel mother sent a message to Ram, saying, "Bharath is coming to kill\nyou,"--that, being another trick against her son.\n\nAfter a long and hard search Bharath found Sri Ram. Running with outstretched\narms to greet Sri Ram, Bharath clung to him, like a child clinging to his\nmother. He cried uncontrollably and begged Sri Ram to return and rule the\ncountry, but he refused to do this and asked his step brother to rule instead.\n\nBharath, in tears, appealed to Sri Ram to come home and said to him, "Our\nfather, who could not stand the separation has passed away, and I shall never\nwear the crown, never, never." But Sri Ram sent his brother home to rule in\nhis stead.\n\nBharath ruled the country for twelve years, but never wore the crown nor sat\non the throne, always placing a picture of Sri Ram there.\n\np. 182\n\nA very learned Priest of that time, Jabali, by name, went to see Sri Ram,\nhoping to persuade him to give up his exile and come home to accept the throne\nand rule over the people, who still grieved for him.\n\nWhat passed between Sri Ram and the Priest is a long story but I would like to\nshare Sri Ram\'s answer with my readers.\n\n"When thus the unbelieving priest,  \nHis subtle lies to vent had ceased,  \nThen Rama made this wise reply,  \nUnmoved by all his sophistry.\n\nThou would\'st that I should cast aside  \nGood faith and truth,--my joy and pride,--  \nThat I may present good secure,  \nAnd flee the ills I now endure.  \nThou would\'st persuade me not to dread  \nThe pains that wait the wicked dead;  \nThou would\'st that men should all despise,--  \nWith scorn reject as silly lies,--  \nThe earnest words of all who teach  \nA future life, and duty preach.  \nThy words, I know, are kindly meant, p. 183  \nBut thou hast failed in thine intent.  \nAs wholesome words at first they sound,  \nBut proved, are false and noxious found.  \nA show of right they have, but tried,  \nThey cannot reason\'s test abide.  \nBelieve me, all the good and wise  \nThat foolish, wilful, man despise,  \nFrom virtue\'s path aside who turns,  \nAnd all restraints impatient spurns.  \nBy conduct only men we know,  \nAs pure and noble, vile and low;  \nTheir natures we can only test,  \nAs acts those natures manifest.  \nShould I the sacred books despise,  \nAnd act as thou dost now advise,--  \nWould I not all the world delude  \nBy seeming noble, pure, and good,  \n\'While I was vicious, vile, and base,  \nA blot upon the royal race?\n\nIf virtues garb assuming, I  \nShould virtue by my deeds deny,  \nShould lead a base and vicious life,  \nWith order, law, and right at strife,  \nHow could I, leading men astray,  \nBy such a course, from wisdom\'s way, p. 184  \nAught else but condemnation stern  \nFrom righteous men and sages earn?  \nBy such a course should I not miss  \nBoth present joy, and heavenly bliss?  \nThe kings their subjects\' weal who seek  \nShould never fail the truth to speak;  \nWhatever promise once they make,  \nThough tempted, they should never break.  \nThe good examples rulers give  \nDirect their people how to live;  \nFor common mortals watch the great,  \nAnd all their doings imitate.  \nA righteous King will rule by truth,  \nAnd temper, too, his acts with ruth.  \nWhen truth abides its guiding law,  \nThen kingly sway is free from flaw.  \nBoth gods and holy Seers delight,  \nIn those who practice truth and right;  \nThough such on earth no bliss attain,  \nThe highest future good they gain.\n\nGood faith and truth are virtue\'s root;  \nFrom them abundant blessings shoot.  \nTruth rules supreme on earth, and nought  \nSurpassing truth can e\'er be thought.  \nAll holy rites, all acts austere,  \nThe sacred books which men revere,--  \nWhich duty\'s laws and forms disclose,-- p. 185  \nThese books themselves on truth repose.  \nWhy should I then be led astray  \nMy sire\'s command to disobey?  \nNo fancied good, no dazzling lure,  \nMy sense of right shall e\'er obscure,  \nOr tempt me under foot to tread  \nMy sacred promise to the dead.\n\nFrom book of J. Muir; Metrical Translations From Sanskrit writers.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: India\'s message to other Countries](yvhf15.htm)\n\n'
