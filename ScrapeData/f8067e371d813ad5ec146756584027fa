The Teacher says: 'If thou thinkest I know it well, then thou knowest\nsurely but little, what is that form of Brahman known, it may be, to thee 2?'\n\n2\\. The Pupil says: 'I do not think I know it well, nor do I know that I do\nnot know it. He\n\np. 149\n\namong us who knows this, he knows it, nor does he know that he does not know\nit 1.\n\n3\\. 'He by whom it (Brahman) is not thought, by him it is thought; he by whom\nit is thought, knows it not. It is not understood by those who understand it,\nit is understood by those who do not understand it.\n\n4\\. 'It is thought to be known (as if) by awakening, and (then) we obtain\nimmortality indeed. By the Self we obtain strength, by knowledge we obtain\nimmortality.\n\n5\\. 'If a man know this here, that is the true (end of life); if he does not\nknow this here, then there is great destruction (new births). The wise who\nhave thought on all things (and recognised the Self in them) become immortal,\nwhen they have departed from this world.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[148:2](sbe01177.htm#fr_370) In order to obtain a verse, we must leave out the\nwords tvam yad asya deveshv atha nu mima _m_ syam eva. They were probably\ninserted, as an excuse for the third kha _n_ _d_ a treating of the relation of\nBrahman to the Devas. There is considerable variety in the text, as handed\ndown in the Sama-veda and in the Atharva-veda, which shows that it has been\ntampered with. Daharam for dabhram may be the older reading, as synezesis\noccurs again and again in the Upanishads.\n\n[149:1](sbe01177.htm#fr_371) This verse has again been variously explained. I\nthink the train of thought is this: We cannot know Brahman, as we know other\nobjects, by referring them to a class and pointing out their differences. But,\non the other hand, we do not know that we know him not, i. e. no one can\nassert that we know him not, for we want Brahman in order to know anything.\nHe, therefore, who knows this double peculiarity of the knowledge of Brahman,\nhe knows Brahman, as much as it can be known; and he does not know, nor can\nanybody prove it to him, that he does not know Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Khanda III](sbe01178.htm)\n\n"
