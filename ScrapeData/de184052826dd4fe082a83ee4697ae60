If it be said--like milk or water; there also (intelligence guides).\n\nWhat has been said--the Sa _n_ khya rejoins--as to the impossibility of the\nPradhana not guided by an intelligent principle constructing this variously\nconstituted world, is unfounded; for the Pradhana may be supposed to act in\nthe same way as milk and water do. Milk, when turning into sour milk, is\ncapable of going by itself through a series of changes: it does not therefore\ndepend on anything else. In the same way we observe that the homogeneous water\ndischarged from the clouds spontaneously proceeds to transform itself into the\nvarious saps and juices of different plants, such as palm trees, mango trees,\nwood-apple trees, lime trees, tamarind trees, and so on. In the same way the\nPradhana, of whose essential nature it is to change, may, without being guided\nby another agent, abide in the interval\n\np. 486\n\nbetween two creations in a state of homogeneousness, and then when the time\nfor creation comes modify itself into many various effects due to the loss of\nequilibrium on the part of the gu _n_ as. As has been said '(the Pradhana\nacts), owing to modification, as water according to the difference of the\nabodes of the several gu _n_ as' (Sa _n_ khya Ka. I, 16). In this way the\nUnevolved acts independently of anything else.\n\nTo this reasoning the Sutra replies 'there also.' Also, in the instances of\nmilk and water, activity is not possible in the absence of an intelligent\nprinciple, for these very cases have already been referred to as proving our\nposition. The Sutra II, 1, 24 (where the change of milk into sour milk is\ninstanced) meant to prove only that a being destitute of other visible\ninstruments of action is able to produce its own special effect, but not to\ndisprove the view of all agency presupposing an intelligent principle. That\neven in water and so on an intelligent principle is present is proved by\nscriptural texts, 'he who dwells in water' and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 3.
