The young shoots\nof rice have the sheen of an infant\'s limbs. The water has invaded the garden\nnext to our house. The morning light, like the love of the blue sky, is\nlavished upon the earth... Why cannot I sing? The water of the distant river\nis shimmering with light; the leaves are glistening; the rice-fields, with\ntheir fitful shivers, break into gleams of gold; and in this symphony of\nAutumn, only I remain voiceless. The sunshine of the world strikes my heart,\nbut is not reflected back.\n\nWhen I realize the lack of expressiveness in myself, I know why I am deprived.\nWho could bear my company day and night without a break? Bimala is full of the\nenergy of life, and so she has never become stale to me for a moment, in all\nthese nine years of our wedded life.\n\nMy life has only its dumb depths; but no murmuring rush. I can only receive:\nnot impart movement. And therefore my company is like fasting. I recognize\nclearly today that Bimala has been languishing because of a famine of\ncompanionship.\n\nThen whom shall I blame? Like Vidyapati I can only lament:\n\nIt is August, the sky breaks into a passionate rain;  \nAlas, empty is my house.\n\nMy house, I now see, was built to remain empty, because its doors cannot open.\nBut I never knew till now that its divinity had been sitting outside. I had\nfondly believed that she had accepted my sacrifice, and granted in return her\nboon. But, alas, my house has all along been empty.\n\nEvery year, about this time, it was our practice to go in a house-boat over\nthe broads of Samalda. I used to tell Bimala that a song must come back to its\nrefrain over and over again. The original refrain of every song is in Nature,\nwhere the rain-laden wind passes over the rippling stream, where the green\nearth, drawing its shadow-veil over its face, keeps its ear close to the\nspeaking water. There, at the beginning of time, a man and a woman first met--\nnot within walls. And therefore we two must come back to Nature, at least once\na year, to tune our love anew to the first pure note of the meeting of hearts.\n\nThe first two anniversaries of our married life I spent in Calcutta, where I\nwent through my examinations. But from the next year onwards, for seven years\nwithout a break, we have celebrated our union among the blossoming water-\nlilies. Now begins the next octave of my life.\n\nIt was difficult for me to ignore the fact that the same month of August had\ncome round again this year. Does Bimala remember it, I wonder?--she has given\nme no reminder. Everything is mute about me.\n\nIt is August, the sky breaks into a passionate rain;  \nAlas, empty is my house.\n\nThe house which becomes empty through the parting of lovers, still has music\nleft in the heart of its emptiness. But the house that is empty because hearts\nare asunder, is awful in its silence. Even the cry of pain is out of place\nthere.\n\nThis cry of pain must be silenced in me. So long as I continue to suffer,\nBimala will never have true freedom. I must free her completely, otherwise I\nshall never gain my freedom from untruth...\n\nI think I have come to the verge of understanding one thing. Man has so fanned\nthe flame of the loves of men and women, as to make it overpass its rightful\ndomain, and now, even in the name of humanity itself, he cannot bring it back\nunder control. Man\'s worship has idolized his passion. But there must be no\nmore human sacrifices at its shrine ...\n\nI went into my bedroom this morning, to fetch a book. It is long since I have\nbeen there in the day-time. A pang passed through me as I looked round it\ntoday, in the morning light. On the clothes rack was hanging a _sari_ of\nBimala\'s, crinkled ready for wear. On the dressing-table were her perfumes,\nher comb, her hair-pins, and with them, still, her vermilion box! Underneath\nwere her tiny gold-embroidered slippers.\n\nOnce, in the old days, when Bimala had not yet overcome her objections to\nshoes, I had got these out from Lucknow, to tempt her. The first time she was\nready to drop for very shame, to go in them even from the room to the\nverandah. Since then she has worn out many shoes, but has treasured up this\npair. When first showing her the slippers, I chaffed her over a curious\npractice of hers; "I have caught you taking the dust of my feet, thinking me\nasleep! These are the offerings of my worship to ward the dust off the feet of\nmy wakeful divinity." "You must not say such things," she protested, "or I\nwill never wear your shoes!"\n\nThis bedroom of mine--it has a subtle atmosphere which goes straight to my\nheart. I was never aware, as I am today, how my thirsting heart has been\nsending out its roots to cling round each and every familiar object. The\nsevering of the main root, I see, is not enough to set life free. Even these\nlittle slippers serve to hold one back.\n\nMy wandering eyes fall on the niche. My portrait there is looking the same as\never, in spite of the flowers scattered round it having been withered black!\nOf all the things in the room their greeting strikes me as sincere. They are\nstill here simply because it was not felt worth while even to remove them.\nNever mind; let me welcome truth, albeit in such sere and sorry garb, and look\nforward to the time when I shall be able to do so unmoved, as does my\nphotograph.\n\nAs I stood there, Bimal came in from behind. I hastily turned my eyes from the\nniche to the shelves as I muttered: "I came to get Amiel\'s Journal." What need\nhad I to volunteer an explanation? I felt like a wrong-doer, a trespasser,\nprying into a secret not meant for me. I could not look Bimal in the face, but\nhurried away.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V](hw21.htm)\n\n'
