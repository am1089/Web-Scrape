Being about to cut the sacrificial stake, he offers 2 with a verse\naddressed to Vish _n_ u. For the stake belongs to Vish _n_ u; therefore he\noffers with a verse addressed to Vish _n_ u.\n\n3:6:4:22\\. And again, why he offers with a verse addressed to Vish _n_ u--Vish\n_n_ u being the sacrifice, he thus approaches the stake by means of the\nsacrifice: therefore he offers with a verse addressed to Vish _n_ u.\n\n3:6:4:33\\. If he offers with the offering-spoon, he offers after taking ghee\nby four ladlings; and if he offers with the dipping-spoon, he offers after\n\'cutting out\' (some ghee from the pot) with the dipping-spoon,--with the text\n(Va _g_. S. V, 41), \'Stride thou widely,\n\np. 163\n\n[paragraph continues] O Vish _n_ u, make wide room for our abode! drink the\nghee, thou born of ghee, and speed the lord of the sacrifice ever onwards!\nHail!\'\n\n3:6:4:44\\. He takes the ghee which is left (in the melting-pot). Whatever\nchopping-knife the carpenter uses, that the carpenter now takes. They then\nproceed (to the wood). Whatever (tree) they select for the stake,\n\n3:6:4:55\\. That he touches while muttering (Va _g_. S. V, 42),--or he salutes\nit while standing behind it with his face towards the east,--\'I have passed\nover the others, I have not gone nigh the others--\' he does indeed pass over\nothers and does not go near to others: wherefore he says, \'I have passed over\nthe others, I have not gone nigh the others.\'\n\n3:6:4:66\\. \'Thee have I found on the nearer side of the farther, and on the\nfarther side of the nearer;\' he does indeed fell it on the nearer side of the\nfarther, of those that are farther away from it; and \'on the farther side of\nthe nearer,\' he says, because he does fell it on the farther side of the\nnearer, of those that are on this side of it. This is why he says, \'Thee have\nI found on the nearer side of the farther, and on the farther side of the\nnearer.\'\n\n3:6:4:77\\. \'Thee do we favour, O divine lord of the forest 1, for the worship\nof the gods.\' As for the good work, he would favour (select) one from amidst\nmany (men) and he (the chosen) would be well-disposed to that work, even so\ndoes he now, for the good work, favour that (tree) from amidst many, and it\nbecomes well-disposed to the felling.\n\np. 164\n\n3:6:4:88\\. \'Thee may the gods favour for the worship of the gods!\' for that is\ntruly successful which the gods favour for the good work: therefore he says,\n\'Thee may the gods favour for the worship of the gods!\'\n\n3:6:4:99\\. He then touches it with the dipping-spoon, with, \'For Vish _n_ u,\nthee!\' for the stake belongs to Vish _n_ u, since Vish _n_ u is the sacrifice,\nand he fells this (tree) for the sacrifice: therefore he says, \'For Vish _n_\nu, thee!\'\n\n3:6:4:1010\\. He then places a blade of darbha-grass between 1, with, \'O plant,\nshield it!\' for the axe is a thunderbolt; but thus that thunderbolt, the axe,\ndoes not hurt it (the tree). He then strikes with the axe, with, \'O axe, hurt\nit not!\' for the axe is a thunderbolt, but thus that thunderbolt, the axe,\ndoes not hurt it.\n\n3:6:4:1111\\. The first chip 2 which he cuts off, he takes (and lays aside).\nLet him cut (the tree) so as to cause no obstruction to the axle 3. For,\nindeed, it is on a cart that they convey it, and in this way he does not\nobstruct the cart.\n\np. 165\n\n3:6:4:1212\\. Let him cut it so as to fall towards the east, for the east is\nthe quarter of the gods; or towards the north, for the north is the quarter of\nmen; or towards the west. But let him take care to keep it from (falling\ntowards) the southern quarter, for that is the quarter of the Fathers:\ntherefore he must take care to keep it from the southern quarter.\n\n3:6:4:1313\\. The falling (tree) he addresses with the text (Va _g_. S. V; 43),\n\'Graze not the sky! hurt not the air! unite with the earth!\' for verily that\n(tree) which they cut for the stake is a thunderbolt, and these worlds tremble\nfor fear of that falling thunderbolt; but he thereby propitiates it for these\nworlds, and thus propitiated it injures not these worlds.\n\n3:6:4:1414\\. Now when he says, \'Graze not the sky,\' he means to say, \'Injure\nnot the sky!\' In the words \'hurt not the air\' there is nothing obscure. By\n\'Unite with the earth,\' he means to say, \'Be thou in harmony with the earth!\'\n\'For this sharp-edged axe hath led thee forward unto great bliss,\' for this\nsharp axe indeed leads it forward.\n\n3:6:4:1515\\. Upon the stump he then offers ghee, \'lest the evil spirits should\nrise therefrom after (the tree):\' ghee being a thunderbolt, he thus repels the\nevil spirits by means of the thunderbolt, and thus the evil spirits do not\nrise therefrom after it. And ghee being seed, he thus endows the trees with\nthat seed; and from that seed (in) the stump trees are afterwards produced 1.\n\n3:6:4:1616\\. He sacrifices with, \'Grow thou out of this, O lord of the forest,\nwith a hundred shoots!\n\np. 166\n\n[paragraph continues] May we grow out with a thousand shoots!\' There is\nnothing obscure in this.\n\n3:6:4:1717\\. Thereupon he cuts it (the stake of the proper length): of\nwhatever length he cuts it the first time, so long let it remain.\n\n3:6:4:1818\\. He may cut it five cubits long; for fivefold is the sacrifice and\nfivefold is the animal (victim), and five seasons there are in the year:\ntherefore he may cut it five cubits long.\n\n3:6:4:1919\\. He may cut it six cubits long; for six seasons there are in the\nyear; and the year is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a\nthunderbolt: therefore he may cut it six cubits long.\n\n3:6:4:2020\\. He may cut it eight cubits long, (for eight syllables has the\nGayatri, and the Gayatri is the fore-part of the sacrifice, as the sacrificial\nstake is the fore-part of the sacrifice: therefore he may cut it eight cubits\nlong.\n\n3:6:4:2121\\. He may cut it nine cubits long, for threefold is the sacrifice,\nand \'nine\' is threefold: therefore he may cut it nine cubits long.\n\n3:6:4:2222\\. He may cut it eleven cubits long, for eleven syllables has the\nTrish _t_ ubh, and the Trish _t_ ubh is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial\nstake is a thunderbolt: therefore he may cut it eleven cubits long.\n\n3:6:4:2323\\. He may cut it twelve cubits long, for twelve months there are in\nthe year, and the year is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a\nthunderbolt: therefore he may cut it twelve cubits long.\n\n3:6:4:2424\\. He may cut it thirteen cubits long, for thirteen months there are\nin a year, and the year is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a\nthunderbolt: therefore he may cut it thirteen cubits long.\n\n3:6:4:2525\\. He may cut it fifteen cubits long, for the\n\np. 167\n\nfifteen-versed chant is a thunderbolt 1, as the sacrificial stake is a\nthunderbolt: therefore he may cut it fifteen cubits long.\n\n3:6:4:2626\\. The sacrificial stake of the Va _g_ apeya sacrifice is seventeen\ncubits long. Indeed, it may be unmeasured 2, for with that same unmeasured\nthunderbolt did the gods conquer the unmeasured; and in like manner does he\nnow conquer the unmeasured with that unmeasured thunderbolt: therefore it may\neven be unmeasured.\n\n3:6:4:2727\\. It is (made to be) eight-cornered, for eight syllables has the\nGayatri, and the Gayatri is the fore-part of the sacrifice, as this (stake) is\nthe forepart of the sacrifice: therefore it is eight-cornered.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[162:1](sbe2626.htm#fr_430) On the Animal Sacrifice, cp. Dr. J. Schwab\'s\ndissertation, \'Das altindische Thieropfer,\' 1882.\n\n[162:2](sbe2626.htm#fr_431) This oblation is called yupahuti, or \'stake-\noffering.\'\n\n[163:1](sbe2626.htm#fr_432) \'Vanaspati\' is a common synonym of v _ri_ ksha,\ntree.\n\n[164:1](sbe2626.htm#fr_433) Viz. he places or holds it against where he is\nabout to strike the tree, so as first to cut the grass.\n\n[164:2](sbe2626.htm#fr_434) For the destination of this chip of the bark, see\n[III, 7, 1, 8](sbe2627.htm#3:7:1:8).\n\n[164:3](sbe2626.htm#fr_435) That is to say, he is not to cut the tree too high\nfrom the ground, so that the axle of the cart might readily pass over the\nremaining stump without touching it. The Ka _n_ va text reads, \'tam\nanakshastambhe v _ri_ _s_ _k_ ed uta hy enam anasa vakshyanto bhavanty uto\nsvarga _m_ hasya loka _m_ yate (sic) \'kshastambha _h_ syat tasmad\nanakshastambhe v _ri_ _s_ _k_ et.\' Nothing is said anywhere about the yupa\nbeing conveyed on a cart to the sacrificial ground, if, indeed, that statement\nrefer to the yupa at all. Saya _n_ a\'s comment is very corrupt here, but he\nseems to interpret the passage to the effect that some people might convey the\nstake on the cart (pakshe anasa yupa _m_ nayeyu _h_ ) and that in that case\nthe cart would be obstructed.\n\n[165:1](sbe2626.htm#fr_436) Or, \'hence trees grow up again from the stump (?\nafter felling, "a vra _s_ _k_ anat") out of seed.\'\n\n[167:1](sbe2626.htm#fr_437) On the connection of the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_\na-stoma with Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt, see part i, introduction,\np. xviii.\n\n[167:2](sbe2626.htm#fr_438) The Ka _n_ va text leaves an option first between\nstakes six, eight, eleven, fifteen (and for the Va _g_ apeya seventeen) cubits\nlong; and finally lays down the rule that no regard is to be had to any fixed\nmeasure.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 7, 1.
