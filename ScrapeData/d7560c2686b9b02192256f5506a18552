'Ether (or space) is better than fire. For in the ether exist both sun and\nmoon, the lightning, stars, and fire (agni). Through the ether we call,\nthrough the ether we hear, through the ether we answer 1. In the ether or\nspace we rejoice (when we are together), and rejoice not (when we are\nseparated). In the ether everything is born, and towards the ether everything\ntends when it is born 2. Meditate on ether.\n\n2\\. 'He who meditates on ether as Brahman, obtains the worlds of ether and of\nlight, which are free from pressure and pain, wide and spacious 3; he is, as\nit were, lord and master as far as ether reaches--he who meditates on ether as\nBrahman.'\n\n'Sir, is there something better than ether?'\n\np. 119\n\nYes, there Is something better than ether.'\n\n'Sir, tell it me.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[118:1](sbe01146.htm#fr_312) Cf. _Kh_.
