 \nWhere, where is royal Rama? show  \nThe hero, victor of the foe.  \nI gaze, but see no Vanars still  \nWho wear each varied shape at will.'  \n   In eager love thus Bharat cried,  \nAnd thus the Wind-God's son replied:  \n'Look, Bharat, on those laden trees  \nThat murmur with the song of bees;  \nFor Rama's sake the saint has made  \nUntimely fruits, unwonted shade.  \nSuch power in ages long ago  \nCould Indra's gracious boon bestow.  \nO, hear the Vanars' voices, hear  \nThe shouting which proclaims them near  \nE'en now about to cross they seem  \nSweet Gomati's delightful stream.  \nI see, I see the car designed  \nBy Brahma's own creative mind,  \nThe car which, radiant as the moon,  \nMoves at the will by Brahma's boon;  \nThe car which once was Ravan's pride,  \nThe victor's spoil when Ravan died.  \nLook, there are Raghu's sons: between  \nThe brothers stands the rescued queen.  \nThere is Vibhishan full in view,  \nSugriva and his retinue.'  \n   He ceased: then rapture loosed each tongue:  \nFrom men and dames, from old and young,  \nOne long, one universal cry,  \n'Tis he,'tis Rama, smote the sky.  \nAll lighted down with eager speed  \nFrom elephant and car and steed,  \nAnd every joyful eye intent  \nOn Rama's moonbright face was bent.  \nEntranced a moment Bharat gazed:  \nThen reverential hands he raised,  \nAnd on his brother humbly pressed  \nThe honours due to welcome guest.  \nThen Bharat clomb the car to greet  \nHis king and bowed him at his feet,  \nTill Rama raised him face to face  \nAnd held him in a close embrace.  \nThen Lakshman and the Maithil dame  \nHe greeted as he spoke his name  1  \nHe greeted next, supreme in place,  \nThe sovereign of the Vanar race,  \nAnd Jambavan and Bali's son,  \n\np. 506  \n\nAnd lords and chiefs, omitting none. 1  \nSugriva to his heart he pressed  \nAnd thus with grateful words addressed:  \n'Four brothers, Vanar king, were we,  \nAnd now we boast a fifth in thee.  \nBy kindly acts a friend we know:  \nOffence and wrong proclaim the foe,'  \nTo King Vibhishan then he spake:  \n'Well hast thou fought fov Rama's sake.'  \nNor was the brave S'atrughna slow  \nHis reverential love to show  \nTo both his brothers, as was meet,  \nAnd venerate the lady's feet.  \nThen Rama to his mother came,  \nSaw her pale cheek and wasted frame,  \nWith gentle words her heart consoled,  \nAnd clasped her feet with loving hold.  \nThen at Sumitra's feet he bent,  \nAnd fair Kaikeyi's, reverent,  \nGreeted each dame from chief to least,  \nAnd bowed him to the household priest.  \nUp rose a shout from all the throng:  \n'O welcome, Rama, mourned so long.  \nWelcome, Kausalya's joy and pride,'  \nTen hundred thousand voices cried.  \nThen Bharat placed, in duty taught,  \nOn Rama's feet the shoes he brought:  \n'My King,' he cried, 'receive again  \nThe pledge preserved through years of pain,  \nThe rule and lordship of the land  \nEntrusted to my weaker hand.  \nNo more I sigh o'er sorrows past,  \nMy birth and life are blest at last  \nIn the glad sight this day has shown,  \nWhen Rama comes to rule his own.'  \n   He ceased: the faithful love that moved  \nThe prince's soul each heart approved;  \nNor could the Vanar chiefs refrain  \nFrom tender tears that fell like rain.  \nThen Rama, stirred with joy anew,  \nHis arms about his brother threw,  \nAnd to the grove his course he bent  \nWhere Bharat's hermit days were spent.  \nAlighting in that pure retreat  \nHe pressed the earth with eager feet.  \nThen, at his hest, the car rose high  \nAnd sailing through the northern sky  \nSped homeward to the Lord of Gold  \nWho owned the wondrous prize of old.  2  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[505:1](ry500.htm#fr_1049) In these respectful salutations the person who\nsalutes his superior mentions his own name even when it is well known to the\nperson whom he salutes.\n\n[506:1](ry500.htm#fr_1050) I have omitted the chieftains' names as they could\nnot be introduced without padding. They are Mainda, Dwivid, Nila Rishabh,\nSushen, Nala, Gavaksha, Gandhamadan, S'arabh, and Panas.\n\n[506:2](ry500.htm#fr_1051) The following addition is found in the Bengal\nrecension: But Vais'ravan (Kuvera) when he beheld his chariot said unto it:\n'Go, and carry Rama, and come unto me when my thought shall call thee, And the\nchariot returned unto Rama:' and he honoured it when he had heard what had\npassed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto CXXX.: The Consecration.](ry501.htm)\n\n"
