I long to know  \nWhat hermit dwelt here long ago.'  \nThen to the prince his holy guide,  \nMost eloquent of men, replied:  \n'O Rama, listen while I tell  \nWhose was this grove, and what befell  \nWhen in the fury of his rage  \nThe high saint cursed the hermitage.  \nThis was the grove--most lovely then--  \nOf Gautam, O thou best of men,  \nLike heaven itself, most honoured by  \nThe Gods who dwell above the sky.  \nHere with Ahalya at his side  \nHis fervid task the ascetic plied.  \nYears fled in thousands. On a day  \nIt chanced the saint had gone away,  \nWhen Town-destroying Indra came,  \nAnd saw the beauty of the dame.  \nThe sage's form the God endued,  \nAnd thus the fair Ahalya wooed:  \n'Love, sweet! should brook no dull delay  \nBut snatch the moments when he may.'  \nShe knew him in the saint's disguise,  \nLord Indra of the Thousand Eyes,  \nBut touched by love's unholy fire,  \nShe yielded to the God's desire.  \n\n'Now, Lord of Gods!' she whispered, 'flee,  \nFrom Gautam save thyself and me.'  \nTrembling with doubt and wild with dread  \nLord Indra from the cottage fled;  \nBut fleeing in the grove he met  \nThe home-returning anchoret,  \nWhose wrath the Gods and fiends would shun,  \nSuch power his fervent rites had won.  \nFresh from the lustral flood he came,  \nIn splendour like the burning flame,  \nWith fuel for his sacred rites,  \nAnd grass, the best of eremites.  \nThe Lord of Gods was sad of cheer  \nTo see the mighty saint so near,  \nAnd when the holy hermit spied  \nIn hermit's garb the Thousand-eyed,  \n\np. 61  \n\nHe knew the whole, his fury broke  \nForth on the sinner as he spoke:  \n\nBecause my form thou hast assumed,  \nAnd wrought this folly, thou art doomed,  \nFor this my curse to thee shall cling,  \nHenceforth a sad and sexless thing'  \n\nNo empty threat that sentence came,  \nIt chilled his soul and marred his frame,  \nHis might and godlike vigour fled,  \nAnd every nerve was cold and dead.  \n\nThen on his wife his fury burst.  \nAnd thus the guilty dame he cursed:  \n'For countless years, disloyal spouse,  \nDevoted to severest vows,  \nThy bed the ashes, air thy food,  \nHere shalt thou live in solitude.  \nThis lonely grove thy home shall be,  \nAnd not an eye thy form shall see.  \nWhen Rama, Das'aratha's child,  \nShall seek these shades then drear and wild,  \nHis coming shall remove thy stain,  \nAnd make the sinner pure again.  \nDue honour paid to him, thy guest,  \nShall cleanse thy fond and erring breast,  \nThee to my side in bliss restore,  \nAnd give thy proper shape once more.' [1](ry049.htm#fn_218)  \n\nThus to his guiltv wife he said,  \nThen far the holy Gautam fled.  \nAnd on Himalaya's lovely heights  \nSpent the long years in sternest rites.'  \n\n        * * * * *  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[60:1](ry048.htm#fr_216) The Heavenly Twins.\n\n[60:2](ry048.htm#fr_217) Not banished from heaven as the inferior Gods and\ndemigods sometimes were.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLIX.: Ahalya Freed.](ry049.htm)\n\n"
