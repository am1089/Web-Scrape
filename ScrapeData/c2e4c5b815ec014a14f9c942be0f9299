When they prepare the knife-paths, the Sacrificer makes for\nhimself that passage across, a bridge, for the attainment of the heavenly\nworld.\n\n13:2:10:22\\. They prepare them by means of needles; the needles, doubtless,\nare the people 3 (clans), and the A _s_ vamedha is the royal power: they thus\nsupply him with people and royal power combined. They are made of gold: the\nmeaning of this has been explained.\n\np. 327\n\n13:2:10:33\\.
