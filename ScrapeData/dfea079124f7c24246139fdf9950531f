From that post which is the largest on the east side (of the hall)\n3 he now strides three steps forwards (to the east), and there drives in a\npeg,--this is the intermediate (peg) 4.\n\np. 112\n\n3:5:1:22\\. From that middle peg he strides fifteen steps to the right, and\nthere drives in a peg,--this is the right hip.\n\n3:5:1:33\\. From that middle peg he strides fifteen steps northwards, and there\ndrives in a peg,--this is the left hip.\n\n3:5:1:44\\. From that middle peg he strides thirty-six steps eastwards, and\nthere drives in a peg,--this is the fore-part 1.\n\n3:5:1:55\\. From that middle peg (in front) he strides twelve steps to the\nright, and there drives in a peg, this is the right shoulder.\n\n3:5:1:66\\. From that middle peg he strides twelve steps to the north, and\nthere drives in a peg,--this is the left shoulder. This is the measure of the\naltar.\n\n3:5:1:77\\. Now the reason why it is thirty steps broad behind is this: the\nVira _g_ metre consists of thirty syllables, and by means of the Vira _g_ the\ngods obtained a firm footing in this world; and even so does he now, by means\nof the Vira _g_ , obtain a firm footing in this world.\n\n3:5:1:88\\. But there may also be thirty-three (steps); for of thirty-three\nsyllables also consists the Vira _g_ ; and by means of the Vira _g_ , he\nobtains a firm footing in this world.\n\n3:5:1:99\\. Then as to why the \'easterly line 2\' is thirty-six steps long;--the\nB _ri_ hati consists of thirty-six syllables, and by means of the B _ri_ hati\nthe gods obtained\n\np. 113\n\nthe heavenly world: and so does he now, by means of the B _ri_ hati, obtain\nthe heavenly world and that offering-fire (\xc3\x82havaniya) of his is in the sky.\n\n3:5:1:1010\\. And as to (the altar) being twenty-four steps broad in\nfront;--the Gayatri consists of twenty-four syllables, and the Gayatri is the\nfore-part of the sacrifice: this is why it is twenty-four steps broad in\nfront. This is the measure of the altar.\n\n3:5:1:1111\\. And why it is broader behind,--\'Wider behind, broad-hipped,\' thus\nthey praise a woman. And by its being wider behind, he makes that womb at the\nhind-part (of the altar) wider, and from that wider womb these creatures are\nborn.\n\n3:5:1:1212\\. That high altar (Uttaravedi 1) is the nose of the sacrifice;\nbecause they throw it up so as to be higher than the altar, therefore it is\ncalled \'high altar.\'\n\n3:5:1:1313\\. Now, in the beginning there were two kinds of beings here, the\n\xc3\x82dityas and the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras. The A\xe1\xb9\x85giras then were the first to prepare a\nsacrifice, and having prepared the sacrifice they said to Agni, \'Announce thou\nto the \xc3\x82dityas this our to-morrow\'s Soma-feast, saying, "Minister ye at this\nsacrifice of ours!"\'\n\n3:5:1:1414\\. The \xc3\x82dityas spake (to one another), \'Contrive ye how the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras\nshall minister unto us, and not we unto the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras!\'\n\n3:5:1:1515\\. They said, \'Verily by nothing but sacrifice is there a way out of\nthis 2: let us undertake another\n\np. 114\n\n[paragraph continues] Soma-feast!\' They brought together the (materials for)\nsacrifice, and having made ready the sacrifice, they said, \'Agni, thou hast\nannounced to us a Soma-feast for to-morrow; but we announce to thee and the\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras a Soma-feast even for to-day: it is for us that thou art (to officiate\nas) Hot _ri_  1!\'\n\n3:5:1:1616\\. They sent back some other (messenger) to the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras; but the\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras going after Agni, were exceeding angry with him, saying, \'Going as our\nmessenger, why didst thou not mind us 2?\'\n\n3:5:1:1717\\. He spake, \'The blameless chose me: as the chosen of the\nblameless, I could not go away.\' And let not therefore the chosen (priest) of\na blameless man turn away from him. The A\xe1\xb9\x85giras then officiated for the\n\xc3\x82dityas in the sacrifice with Soma bought (kri) on the same day (sadyas);\nwhence this Sadya _h_ kri 3.\n\n3:5:1:1818\\. They brought Va _k_ (speech) to them for their sacrificial fee.\nThey accepted her not, saying, \'We shall be losers if we accept her.\' And so\nthe performance of that sacrifice was not discharged (completed), as it was\none requiring a sacrificial fee.\n\n3:5:1:1919\\. Thereupon they brought Surya (the sun) to them, and they accepted\nhim. Wherefore the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras say, \'Verily, we are fit for the sacrificial\noffice, we are worthy to receive Dakshi _n_ as; yea, even he that burns yonder\nhas been received by us 4!\'\n\np. 115\n\n[paragraph continues] Hence a white horse is the sacrificial fee for the Sadya\n_h_ kri.\n\n3:5:1:2020\\. On the front of this (horse) there is a golden ornament, whereby\nit is made an image of him that burns yonder.\n\n3:5:1:2121\\. Now Va _k_ was angry with them: \'In what respect, forsooth, is\nthat one better than I,--wherefore is it, that they should have accepted him\nand not me 1?\' So saying she went away from them. Having become a lioness she\nwent on seizing upon (everything 2) between those two contending parties, the\ngods and the Asuras. The gods called her to them, and so did the Asuras. Agni\nwas the messenger of the gods, and one Saharakshas for the Asura-Rakshas.\n\n3:5:1:2222\\. Being willing to go over to the gods, she said, \'What would be\nmine, if I were to come over to you?\'--\'The offering shall reach thee even\nbefore (it reaches) Agni.\' She then said to the gods, \'Whatsoever blessing ye\nwill invoke through me, all that shall be accomplished unto you!\' So she went\nover to the gods.\n\n3:5:1:2323\\. And, accordingly, when he pours ghee on the high altar 3, while\nthe fire is held (over it)--since the gods said to her on that occasion, \'The\noffering shall reach thee even before Agni\'--then that offering does reach her\neven before (it reaches) Agni; for this (high altar) is in reality Va _k_. And\nwhen he raises\n\np. 116\n\nthe high altar, it is for the completeness of the sacrifice, for the sacrifice\nis Va _k_ (speech) and that (high altar) is Va _k_.\n\n3:5:1:2424\\. He measures it with the yoke and pin;--namely with the yoke (that\nplace) whither they take (the earth); and with a yoke-pin that, from whence\nthey take (the earth 1), for the team is harnessed with the yoke and the pin:\nit is because she (Va _k_ ), as a lioness, at that time roamed about\nunappeased that he thus yokes her here at the sacrifice.\n\n3:5:1:2525\\. One must not therefore accept a Dakshi _n_ a (sacrificial fee)\nthat has been refused (by another priest 2), for, having turned into a\nlioness, it destroys him;--nor must he (the sacrificer) take it home again,\nfor, having turned into a lioness, it destroys him;--nor must he give it to\nany one else, as he would thereby make over the sacrifice to some one other\nthan himself. Hence if he have any wretched kinsman, let him give it to him;\nfor in that he gives it away, it will not turn into a lioness and destroy him;\nand in that he gives it to a kinsman, he does not make over (the sacrifice) to\none other than himself: and this is the settling of a refused Dakshi _n_ a.\n\n3:5:1:2626\\. He now takes the yoke-pin and the wooden sword; and from where\nthe northern peg of the front side is, he strides three steps backwards and\nthere marks off the pit ( _k_ atvala). The measure for the pit is the same (as\nfor the high altar) 3; there\n\np. 117\n\nis no (other) measure in regard to it: wherever he himself may think fit in\nhis mind (to fix it), in front of the heap of rubbish (utkara), there let him\nmark off the pit.\n\n3:5:1:2727\\. From the (north) edge of the altar he lays down the pin from\nsouth to north, and draws the (western) outline, with the text (Va _g_. S. V,\n9), \'Thou art for me the resort of the afflicted!\' Thereby he means this\n(earth), for it is thereon that he walks afflicted.\n\n3:5:1:2828\\. Thereupon he lays down the pin in front from south to north, and\ndraws the outline with, \'Thou art my wealth-resort.\' Thereby he means this\n(earth), for it is thereon that he walks having acquired (wealth).\n\n3:5:1:2929\\. He then lays down the pin along the (north) edge of the altar\nfrom west to east, and draws the outline with, \'Preserve me from being in want\n1!\' Thereby he means this (earth): \'Wherever there is want, from that preserve\nme!\'\n\n3:5:1:3030\\. He then lays down the pin on the north side from west to east,\nand draws the outline with, \'Preserve me from being afflicted 1!\' Thereby he\n\np. 118\n\nmeans this (earth): \'wherever there is affliction, from that preserve me!\'\n\n3:5:1:3131\\. He then flings (the wooden sword) 1; at the place where he flings\n2, the Agnidh sits. He flings while mentioning the names of the Agnis 3. For\nthose (three) Agnis whom the gods at first chose for the office of Hot _ri_\npassed away: they crept into these very earths,--namely, into this one and the\ntwo beyond it. It is really with this one 4 that he now flings.\n\n3:5:1:3232\\. He flings with the texts, \'May the Agni called Nabhas 5 know\n(thee)! Go thou, O Agni, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, with the name of \xc3\x82yu (life)!\' What life they\npassed away from 6 that he bestows, that he re-animates. Having with, \'Thou\nwho art in this earth,\' taken (the loose soil dug up by the wooden sword), he\nputs it down (on the altar 7), with, \'Whatever inviolate, holy name of thine,\n\np. 119\n\ntherewith I lay thee down!\' whereby he means to say, \'whatever holy name,\nunviolated by the Rakshas, is thine, thereby I lay thee down 1.\'--With \'Thee,\nmoreover, for the delight of the gods,\' he takes (earth) a fourth time 2;\nwhereby he means to say, \'I take thee well-pleasing to the gods.\' He takes\nthat (high altar) from a quadrangular pit, for there are four quarters: thus\nhe takes it from all the four quarters.\n\n3:5:1:3333\\. Thereupon he shifts (the earth) asunder, with the text (Va _g_.\nS. V, 10), \'Thou art a lioness, overcoming the enemies; be thou meet for the\ngods!\' Inasmuch as, on that occasion, she became a lioness and roamed about\nunappeased, therefore he says to her, \'Thou art a lioness;\' and by \'overcoming\nthe enemies\' he means to say, \'Through thee may we worst our enemies.\' \'Be\nthou meet for the gods\' he says, because the high altar is a woman: her he\nthus renders meet for the gods.\n\n3:5:1:3434\\. He makes it on each side either of the size of the yoke, or ten\nfeet of the sacrificer\'s 3; for the\n\np. 120\n\n[paragraph continues] Vira _g_ consists of ten syllables, and the Vira _g_ is\nspeech, and the sacrifice is speech. In the middle 1 he makes, as it were, a\nnavel, thinking, \'Seated in one and the same place, I shall sprinkle (ghee)\nall round 2.\'\n\n3:5:1:3535\\. He sprinkles it with water: inasmuch as, on that occasion, she\nbecame a lioness and roamed about unappeased--water being (a means of)\nappeasement--he appeases her with water. And, the high altar being a woman, he\nthereby fits her for the gods: this is why he sprinkles it with water.\n\n3:5:1:3636\\. He sprinkles it with, \'Thou art a lioness, overcoming the\nenemies: get thee pure for the gods!\' He then bestrews it with gravel. Now\ngravel certainly is an ornament, because gravel is rather shining. And that\ngravel being the ashes of Agni Vai _s_ vanara, he is now about to place Agni\nthereon, and so Agni does not injure it: this is why he bestrews it with\ngravel. He bestrews it with, \'Thou art a lioness, overcoming the enemies:\narray thee for the gods!\' He then covers it 3, and thus covered it remains\nduring that night.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[111:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_291) The preparation of the special altars--viz. the\nlarge Soma altar (maha-vedi, or saumiki-vedi) and the \'high altar\' (uttara-\nvedi) on the former--takes place on the last but one Upasad day, after the\nmorning performance of the Upasads.\n\n[111:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_292) This post stands in the middle of the east door of\nthe hall or Pra _k_ ina-va _m_ _s_ a, just in front of the \xc3\x82havaniya-fire. See\n[p. 3](sbe2603.htm#page_3), note [2](sbe2603.htm#fn_27).\n\n[111:4](sbe2619.htm#fr_293) Anta _h_ pata, lit. \'falling within or between,\'\nbecause it stands p. 112 between the (new) altar and the Pra _k_ ina-va _m_\n_s_ a fires and altar. See III, 5, 2, 2.\n\n[112:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_294) That is, the middle of the front side of the\naltar, or, as it were, its head, where the \'high altar\' is to be raised.\n\n[112:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_295) The \'pra _k_ i\' is the line drawn from the middle\nof the west side to that of the front side of the altar, forming as it were\nthe spine (p _ri_ sh _th_ ya) of the altar.\n\n[113:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_296) On the uttara-vedi (lit. \'higher, upper altar\'),\nnow about to be raised on the fore-part of the great altar (maha-vedi or\nsaumiki vedi) described in the preceding paragraphs, see also part i, p. 392\nnote.\n\n[113:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_297) The Ka _n_ va MS. reads, napakrama _n_ am astv\niti, which, if correct, p. 114 would mean, \'Let there be no going away!\' i.e.\n\'Let us not go (to the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras)!\' or perhaps, \'Do not thou (Agni) go away!\'\n\n[114:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_298) Tesha _m_ nas tva _m_ hotasiti, perhaps \'thou wilt\nsacrifice for us.\'\n\n[114:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_299) \'Sent by us, why didst thou not return?\' Ka _n_ va\nrec.\n\n[114:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_300) An ekaha (one day\'s) performance of the Soma-\nsacrifice at which the consecrations, buying and pressing of Soma, are\ncompressed into one day.\n\n[114:4](sbe2619.htm#fr_301) Api va asmabhir esha pratig _ri_ hita _h_ , \'Ist\ndoch jener von uns empfangen worden.\'\n\n[115:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_302) The Ka _n_ va text reads, Na mad esha kena _k_ ana\n_s_ reyan iti na bandhuna na kena _k_ ana katham eta _m_ prag _ri_ h _n_ iyur\nna mam iti; \'That one is not my superior by anything, not by kinship, not by\nanything, why should they accept him and not me?\'\n\n[115:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_303) \xc3\x82dadana _k_ a _k_ ara = _g_ ighatsaya samipastha\n_m_ sarva _m_ svikurvati, Say.\n\n[115:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_304) See [III](sbe2620.htm#3:5:2:9), 5, 2,\n9-[11](sbe2620.htm#3:5:2:11).\n\n[116:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_305) That is to say, the pit ( _k_ atvala) whence the\nearth for the high altar is taken is measured with the yoke-pin, and the high\naltar with the yoke. Saya _n_ a seems to take it differently: Yatra yasmin de\n_s_ e yugena haranti yato yasmat tatra _s_ amyayapi haranti.\n\n[116:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_306) Or perhaps, one must not take back a Dakshi _n_ a,\nrefused by a priest.\n\n[116:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_307) The earth taken from the pit being used for\nconstructing the p. 117 high altar, both are of the same size or cubic\ncontent. The pit is to measure thirty-two a\xe1\xb9\x85gulas (about two feet) on each\nside. As to the exact distance of the pit from the north-east peg, this is to\nbe left to the discretion of the Adhvaryu, provided it be in front of the\nutkara, or heap of rubbish formed in making the large altar (on which the high\naltar is raised), and a passage be left between the utkara and the pit. The\nlatter is contiguous to the north edge of the large altar. As described in the\nsucceeding paragraphs, the west side is marked off first (by drawing the\nwooden sword along the inner side of the yoke-pin), then successively the\nfront, the south, and the north sides.\n\n[117:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_309) For \'nathitat\' and \'vyathitat,\' the Ka _n_ va\ntext, as the Taitt. S. VI, 2, 7, 2, has the readings \'nathitam\' and\n\'vyathitam.\'\n\n[118:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_310) Compare the Stambaya _g_ ur-hara _n_ am (which has\nalso to be performed on the present occasion, in preparing the large altar),\nI, 2, 4, 8 seq.\n\n[118:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_311) That is, at the place where the uttaravedi is to\nbe raised, whence the Adhvaryu throws the sphya to where the pit is to be dug.\nWhile he throws (or thrusts in) the wooden sword, the sacrificer has to take\nhold of him from behind.\n\n[118:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_312) See I, 2, 3, 1.\n\n[118:4](sbe2619.htm#fr_313) I.e. with the Agni who entered into this earth.\n\n[118:5](sbe2619.htm#fr_314) Apparently \'vapour, welkin.\' The Ka _n_ va rec.\nreads, \'Mayest thou know Agni\'s name Nabhas\' (Vider Agner, &c.). The Taitt.\nS., on the other hand, reads \'vider Agnir nabho nama,\' which Saya _n_ a\nexplains by \'the Agni of the vedi (!) is Nabhas by name.\'\n\n[118:6](sbe2619.htm#fr_315) Yat pradhanva _m_ s tad ayur dadhati. Perhaps we\nought to read with the Ka _n_ va text, Vat pradhanvat tad asminn ayur dadhati\ntad ena _m_ samirayati, \'the life which passed away (?), that he bestows on\nhim, therewith he re-animates him.\'\n\n[118:7](sbe2619.htm#fr_316) He throws it on the fore-part of the altar, close\nto the peg marking the middle of the front side, where the \'high altar\' is to\nbe raised on it.\n\n[119:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_317) He repeats the same ceremony a second and a third\ntime with the same texts, except that, instead of \'Thou who art in this\nearth,\' he says, \'Thou who art in the second (third) earth.\'\n\n[119:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_318) He takes with the spade as much as is required to\nmake the high altar of the proper size.\n\n[119:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_319) This statement seems to have greatly puzzled the\nlater ritualists, as Katy. V, 3, 32-35 and the comments thereon show. In rule\n32 it is laid down, in accordance with [paragraph 26](sbe2619.htm#3:5:1:26)\nabove, that the Adhvaryu is to make the high altar of the size of the yoke-pin\nand the pit, i.e. about two feet square. The next rule then leaves an option\nbetween four other measurements, viz. he may make it either one third of the\narea of the large altar, or of unlimited size, or of the size of the yoke (86\na\xe1\xb9\x85gulas = c. 5-5\xc2\xbd feet) or of ten of the sacrificer\'s feet. This latter\nmeasurement is explained rather ingeniously by Harisvamin, as meaning that the\nhigh altar is to form p. 120 an oblong of three feet by one foot, when, in\ncounting the number of sides of the three squares thus obtained, we obtain ten\nsides of one foot each. However, the repetition of \'da _s_ a\' in our text--\nwhich can only mean \'ten feet on each side\'--does not favour this explanation,\nThe last two alternatives, according to rules 34-35, only apply to the Soma-\nsacrifice, because otherwise the altar (as in the case of the \'northern altar\'\nat the _K_ aturmasya, cf. part i, p. 392) would not be large enough to contain\na \'high altar\' of that size.\n\n[120:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_320) The Ka _n_ va text wants it to be made at the back\n( _g_ aghanena).\n\n[120:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_321) When he makes the libation of ghee on the high\naltar (III, 5, 2, 9-14 he pours it on the four corners of the \'navel\' and\nthereby, as it were, on the whole \'high altar.\'\n\n[120:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_322) Viz. with branches of udumbara or plaksha (see\nIII, 8, 3, 10), or with darbha grass.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 5, 2.
