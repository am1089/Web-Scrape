 \nThick set with trees of every kind,  \nWith trailing shrubs and plants entwined;  \nHome of the ape and monkey, lair  \nOf mountain cat and pard and bear,  \nIn cloudy gloom against the sky  \nThe sanctifying hills rose high.  \nPierced in their crest, a spacious cave  \nTo Raghu's sons a shelter gave.  \nThen Rama, pure from every crime,  \nIn words well suited to the time  \nTo Lakshman spake, whose faithful zeal  \nWatched humbly for his brother's weal:  \n'I love this spacious cavern where  \nThere breathes a fresh and pleasant air.  \nBrave brother, let us here remain  \nThroughout the season of the rain.  \nFor in mine eyes this mountain crest  \nIs above all, the loveliest.  \nWhere copper-hued and black and white  \nShow the huge blocks that face the height;  \nWhere gleams the shine of varied ore,  \nWhere dark clouds baog and torrents roar;  \nWhere waving woods are fair to see,  \nAnd creepers climb from tree to tree;  \nWhere the gay peacock's voice is shrill,  \nAnd sweet birds carol on the hill;  \nWhere odorous breath is wafted far  \nFrom Jessamine and Sinduvar;  1  \nAnd opening flowers of every hue  \nGive wondrous beauty to the view.  \nSee, too, this pleasant water near  \nOur cavern home is fresh and clear;  \nAnd lilies gay with flower and bud  \nAre glorious on the lovely flood.  \nThis cave that fares north and east  \nWill shelter us till rain has ceased;  \nAnd towering hills thut rise behind  \nWill screen us from the furious wind.  \nClose by the cavern's portal lies  \nAnd level stone of ample size  \nAnd sable hue, a mighty block  \nLong severed from the parent rock.  \nNow let thine eye bent northward rest  \n\nA while upon that mountain creat,  \nHigh as a cloud that brings the rain,  \nAnd dark as iron rent in twain.  \nLook southward, brother, now and view  \nA cloudy pile of paler hue  \nLike Mount Kailasa's topmost height  \nWhere ores of every tint are bright,  \nSee, Lakshman, see before our cave  \nThat clear brook eastward roll its wave  \nAs though 'twere Ganga's infant rill  \nDown streaming from the three-peaked bill  \nSee, by the water's gentle flow  \nAs'oka, sal, and sandal grow.  \nAnd every lovely tree most fair  \nWith leaf and bud and flower is there.  \nSee there, beneath the bending trees  \nThat fringe her bank, the river flees,  \nClothed with their beauty like a maid  \nIn all her robes and gems arrayed,  \nWhile from the sedgy banks are heard  \nThe soft notes of each amorous bird.  \nO see what lovely islets stud  \nLike gems the bosom of the flood.  \nAnd sarases and wild swans crowd  \nAbout her till she laughs aloud.  \nSee, lotus blooms the brook o'erspread,  \nSome tender blue, some dazzling red,  \nAnd opening lilies white as snow  \nTheir buds in rich profusion show.  \nThere rings the joyous peacock's scream,  \nThere stands the curlew by the stream,  \nAnd holy hermits love to throng  \nWhere the sweet waters speed along.  \nRanged on the grassy margin shine  \nGay sandal trees in glittering line,  \nAnd all the wondrous verdure seems  \nThe offspring of creative dreams,  \nO conquering Prince, there cannot be  \nA lovelier place than this we see.  \nHere sheltered on the beauteous height  \nOur days will pass in calm delight.  \n\nNor is Kishkindha's city, gay  \nWith grove and garden, far away.  \nThence will the breeze of evening bring  \nSweet music as the minstrels sing;  \nAnd, when the Vanars dance, will come  \nThe sound of labour and of drum.  \nAgain to spouse and realm restored.  \nGirt by his friends, the Vanar lord  \nGreat glory has acquired; and how  \nCan he be less than happy now?'  \nThis said, the son of Raghu made  \nHis dwelling in that pleasant shade  \nUpon the mountain's shelving side  \nThat sweetly all his wants supplied.  \nBut still the hero's troubled mind  \nNo comfort in his woe could find.  \nYet mourning for his stolen wife  \nDearer to Rama than his life.  \nChief when he saw the Lord of Night  \nRise slowly o'er the eastern height,  \n\np. 358  \n\nHe tossed upon his leafy bed  \nWith eyes by sleep unvisited.  \nOutwelled the tears in ceaseless flow,  \nAnd every sense was numbed by woe.  \nEach pang that pierced the mourner through  \nSmote Lakshman's faithful bosom too,  \nWho, troubled for his brother's sake,  \nWith wisest words the prince bespake:  \n'Arise, my brother, and be strong:  \nThy hero heart has mourned too long.  \nThou knowest well that tears and sighs  \nWill mar the mightiest enterprise.  \nThine was the soul that loved to dare:  \nTo serve the Gods was still thy care;  \nAnd ne'er may sorrow's sting subdue  \nA heart so resolute and true.  \nHow canst thou hope to slay in fight  \nThe giant cruel in his might?  \nUnwearied must the champion be  \nWho strives with such a foe as he.  \nTear out this sorrow by the root;  \nAgain be bold and resolute.  \nArise, my brother, and subdue  \nThe demon and his wicked crew.  \nThou canst destroy the earth, her seas,  \nHer rooted hills and giant trees  \nUnseated by thy furious hand:  \nAnd shall one fiend thy power withstand?  \nWait through this season of the rain  \nTill suns of autumn dry the plain,  \nThen shall thy giant foe, and all  \nHis host and realm, before thee fall.  \nI wake thy valour that has slept  \nAmid the tears thine eyes have wept;  \nAs drops of oil in worship raise  \nThe dormant flame to sudden blaze.'  \n\nThe son of Raghu heard: he knew  \nHis brother's rede was wise and true;  \nAnd, honouring his friendly guide,  \nIn gentle words he thus replied:  \n'Whate'er a hero firm and bold,,  \nDevoted, true, and lofty-souled  \nShould speak by deep affection led,  \nSuch are the words which thou hast said.  \nI cast away each pensive thought  \nThat brings the noblest plans to naught,  \nAnd each uninjured power will strain  \nUntil the purposed end we gain.  \nThy prudent words will I obey,  \nAnd till the close of rain-time stay,  \nWhen King Sugriva will invite  \nTo action, and the streams be bright.  \nThe hero saved in hour of need  \nRepays the debt with friendly deed:  \nBut hated by the good are they  \nWho take the boon and ne'er repay.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[357:1](ry301.htm#fr_618) Vitex Negundo.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXVIII.: The Rains.](ry302.htm)\n\n"
