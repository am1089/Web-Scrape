Crank though he be, laugh at him as I may, I\ncannot get rid of the idea that he is my friend. At first I gave no thought to\nhis point of view, but of late it has begun to shame and hurt me. Therefore I\nhave been trying to talk and argue with him in the same enthusiastic way as of\nold, but it does not ring true. It is even leading me at times into such a\nlength of unnaturalness as to pretend to agree with him. But such hypocrisy is\nnot in my nature, nor in that of Nikhil either. This, at least, is something\nwe have in common. That is why, nowadays, I would rather not come across him,\nand have taken to fighting shy of his presence.\n\nAll these are signs of weakness. No sooner is the possibility of a wrong\nadmitted than it becomes actual, and clutches you by the throat, however you\nmay then try to shake off all belief in it. What I should like to be able to\ntell Nikhil frankly is, that happenings such as these must be looked in the\nface--as great Realities--and that which is the Truth should not be allowed to\nstand between true friends.\n\nThere is no denying that I have really weakened. It was not this weakness\nwhich won over Bimala; she burnt her wings in the blaze of the full strength\nof my unhesitating manliness. Whenever smoke obscures its lustre she also\nbecomes confused, and draws back. Then comes a thorough revulsion of feeling,\nand she fain would take back the garland she has put round my neck, but\ncannot; and so she only closes her eyes, to shut it out of sight.\n\nBut all the same I must not swerve from the path I have chalked out. It would\nnever do to abandon the cause of the country, especially at the present time.\nI shall simply make Bimala one with my country. The turbulent west wind which\nhas swept away the country's veil of conscience, will sweep away the veil of\nthe wife from Bimala's face, and in that uncovering there will be no shame.\nThe ship will rock as it bears the crowd across the ocean, flying the pennant\nof _Bande Mataram_ , and it will serve as the cradle to my power, as well as\nto my love.\n\nBimala will see such a majestic vision of deliverance, that her bonds will\nslip from about her, without shame, without her even being aware of it.\nFascinated by the beauty of this terrible wrecking power, she will not\nhesitate a moment to be cruel. I have seen in Bimala's nature the cruelty\nwhich is the inherent force of existence--the cruelty which with its\nunrelenting might keeps the world beautiful.\n\nIf only women could be set free from the artificial fetters put round them by\nmen, we could see on earth the living image of Kali, the shameless, pitiless\ngoddess. I am a worshipper of Kali, and one day I shall truly worship her,\nsetting Bimala on her altar of Destruction. For this let me get ready.\n\nThe way of retreat is absolutely closed for both of us. We shall despoil each\nother: get to hate each other: but never more be free.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV](hw20.htm)\n\n"
