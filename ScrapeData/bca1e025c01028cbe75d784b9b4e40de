Rather not, as the text does not declare their going together.\n\nIt is not true that the meditations on the Udgitha and the rest are bound to\nthe sacrifices in the same way as the Udgitha, and so on, themselves are; for\nScripture does not declare that they go together with, i.e. are subordinate\nconstituents of the Udgitha, and so on. The clause 'Let him meditate on the\nUdgitha' does not indeed itself state another qualification on the part of the\nagent (i.e. does not state that the agent in entering on the meditation is\nprompted by a motive other than the one prompting the sacrifice); but the\nsubsequent clause, ' whatever he does with knowledge, with faith, with the\nUpanishad, that becomes more vigorous,' intimates that knowledge is the means\nto render the sacrificial work more efficacious, and from this it follows that\nthe meditation is enjoined as a means towards effecting a result other than\nthe result of the sacrifice. And hence the meditation cannot be viewed as a\nsubordinate member of the Udgitha, which itself is a subordinate member of the\nsacrifice. It rather has the Udgitha for its basis only. He only indeed who is\nqualified for the sacrifice is qualified for the meditation, since the latter\naims at greater efficaciousness of the sacrifice; but this does not imply that\nthe meditation necessarily goes with the sacrifice. By the greater vigour of\nthe sacrifice is meant its non-obstruction by some other sacrificial work of\ngreater strength, its producing its effect without any delay.--The case of a\nstatement such as 'he whose ladle is of par _n_ a wood hears no evil sound' is\ndifferent. There the text does not declare that the quality\n\np. 685\n\nof consisting of par _n_ a wood is the direct means of bringing about the\nresult of no evil sound being heard; hence there is no valid reason why that\nquality should not be subordinate to the ladle, which itself is subordinate to\nthe sacrifice; and as it is not legitimate to assume for the mere subordinate\nconstituents of a sacrifice special fruits (other than the general fruit of\nthe sacrifice), the declaration as to no evil sound being heard is to be\nviewed as a mere arthavada (i.e. a mere additional statement meant further to\nglorify the result of the sacrifice--of which the ladle made of par _n_ a wood\nis a subordinate instrument).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 64.
