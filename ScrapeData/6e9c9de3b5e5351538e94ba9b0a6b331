Hereby all (the doctrines concerning the origin of the world which are\nopposed to the Vedanta) are explained, are explained.\n\nThe doctrine according to which the pradhana is the cause of the world has, in\nthe Sutras beginning with I, 1, 5, been again and again brought forward and\nrefuted. The chief reason for the special attention given to that doctrine is\nthat the Vedanta-texts contain some passages which, to people deficient in\nmental penetration, may appear to contain inferential marks pointing to it.\nThe\n\np. 289\n\ndoctrine, moreover, stands somewhat near to the Vedanta doctrine since, like\nthe latter, it admits the non-difference of cause and effect, and it,\nmoreover, has been accepted by some of the authors of the Dharma-sutras, such\nas Devala, and so on. For all these reasons we have taken special trouble to\nrefute the pradhana doctrine, without paying much attention to the atomic and\nother theories. These latter theories, however, must likewise be refuted, as\nthey also are opposed to the doctrine of Brahman being the general cause, and\nas slow-minded people might think that they also are referred to in some Vedic\npassages. Hence the Sutrakara formally extends, in the above Sutra, the\nrefutation already accomplished of the pradhana doctrine to all similar\ndoctrines which need not be demolished in detail after their great\nprotagonist, the pradhana doctrine, has been so completely disposed of. They\nalso are, firstly, not founded on any scriptural authority; and are, secondly,\ndirectly contradicted by various Vedic passages.--The repetition of the phrase\n'are explained' is meant to intimate that the end of the adhyaya has been\nreached.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 1](sbe34140.htm)\n\n"
