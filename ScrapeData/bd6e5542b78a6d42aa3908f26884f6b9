Even on the aggregate with its two causes, there is non-establishment of\nthat.\n\nWe so far have refuted the Vaiseshikas, who hold the doctrine of atoms\nconstituting the general cause. Now the followers of Buddha also teach that\nthe world originates from atoms, and the Sutras therefore proceed to declare\nthat on their view also the origination, course, and so on, of the world\ncannot rationally be accounted for. These Bauddhas belong to four different\nclasses. Some of them hold that all outward things, which are either elements\n(bhuta) or elemental (bhautika), and all inward things which are either mind\n(kitta) or mental (kaitta),--all these things consisting of aggregates of the\natoms of earth, water, fire and air--are proved by means of Perception as well\nas Inference. Others hold that all external things, earth, and so on, are only\nto be inferred from ideas (vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana). Others again teach that the only\nreality are ideas to which no outward things correspond; the (so-called)\noutward things are like the things seen in dreams. The three schools mentioned\nagree in holding that the things admitted by them have a momentary existence\nonly, and do not allow that, in addition to the things mentioned, viz.\nelements and elemental things, mind and mental things, there are certain\nfurther independent entities such as ether, Self, and so on.--Others finally\nassert a universal void, i.e. the non-reality of everything.\n\np. 501\n\nThe Sutras at first dispose of the theory of those who acknowledge the real\nexistence of external things. Their opinion is as follows. The atoms of earth\nwhich possess the qualities of colour, taste, touch and smell; the atoms of\nwater which possess the qualities of colour, taste and touch; the atoms of\nfire which possess the qualities of colour and touch; and the atoms of air\nwhich possess the quality of touch only, combine so as to constitute earth,\nwater, fire and air; and out of the latter there originate the aggregates\ncalled bodies, sense-organs, and objects of sense-organs. And that flow of\nideas, which assumes the form of the imagination of an apprehending agent\nabiding within the body,is what constitutes the so-called Self. On the\nagencies enumerated there rests the entire empiric world.--On this view the\nSutra remarks, 'Even on the aggregate with its two causes, there is non-\nestablishment of that'. That aggregate which consists of earth and the other\nelements and of which the atoms are the cause; and that further aggregate\nwhich consists of bodies, sense-organs and objects, and of which the elements\nare the cause--on neither of these two aggregates with their twofold causes\ncan there be proved establishment of that, i.e. can the origination of that\naggregate which we call the world be rationally established. If the atoms as\nwell as eaith and the other elements are held to have a momentary existence\nonly, when, we ask, do the atoms which perish within a moment, and the\nelements, move towards combination, and when do they combine? and when do they\nbecome the 'objects of states of consciousness'? and when do they become the\nabodes of the activities of appropriation, avoidance and so on (on the part of\nagents)? and what is the cognising Self? and with what objects does it enter\ninto contact through the sense-organs? and which cognising Self cognises which\nobjects, and at what time? and which Self proceeds to appropriate which\nobjects, and at what time? For the sentient subject has perished, and the\nobject of sensation has perished; and the cognising subject has perished, and\nthe object cognised has perished. And how can one subject cognise what has\nbeen apprehended\n\np. 502\n\nthrough the senses of another? and how is one subject to take to itself what\nanother subject has cognised? And should it be said that each stream of\ncognitions is one (whereby a kind of unity of the cognising subject is claimed\nto be established), yet this affords no sufficient basis for tne ordinary\nnotions and activities of life, since the stream really is nothing different\nfrom the constituent parts of the stream (all of which are momentary and hence\ndiscrete).--That in reality the Ego constitutes the Self and is the knowing\nsubject, we have proved previously.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 18.
