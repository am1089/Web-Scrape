II (3).--The devotee engaged in meditation on Brahman is to view it as\nconstituting his own Self.\n\np. lxvii\n\nAdhik. III (4).--To the rule laid down in the preceding adhikara _n_ a the so-\ncalled pratikopasanas, i.e. those meditations in which Brahman is viewed under\na symbol or outward manifestation (as, for instance, mano brahmety upasita)\nconstitute an exception, i.e. the devotee is not to consider the pratika as\nconstituting his own Self.\n\nAdhik. IV (5).--In the pratikopasanas the pratika is to be meditatively viewed\nas being one with Brahman, not Brahman as being one with the pratika.--Ramanu\n_g_ a takes Sutra 5 as simply giving a reason for the decision arrived at\nunder Sutra 4, and therefore as not constituting a new adhikara _n_ a.\n\nAdhik. V (6).--In meditations connected with constitutives of sacrificial\nworks (as, for instance, ya evasau tapati tam udgitham upasita) the idea of\nthe divinity, &c. is to be transferred to the sacrificial item, not vice\nversa. In the example quoted, for instance, the udgitha is to be viewed as\n\xc3\x82ditya, not \xc3\x82ditya as the udgitha.\n\nAdhik. VI (7-10).--The devotee is to carry on his meditations in a sitting\nposture.-- _S_ a _n_ kara maintains that this rule does not apply to those\nmeditations whose result is sa _m_ yagdar _s_ ana; but the Sutra gives no hint\nto that effect.\n\nAdhik. VII (11).--The meditations maybe carried on at any time, and in any\nplace, favourable to concentration of mind.\n\nAdhik. VIII (12).--The meditations are to be continued until death.-- _S_ a\n_n_ kara again maintains that those meditations which lead to sa _m_ yagdar\n_s_ ana are excepted.\n\nAdhik. IX (13).--When through those meditations the knowledge of Brahman has\nbeen reached, the vidvan is no longer affected by the consequences of either\npast or future evil deeds.\n\nAdhik. X (14).--Good deeds likewise lose their efficiency.--The literal\ntranslation of the Sutra is, \'There is likewise non-attachment (to the vidvan)\nof the other (i. e. of the deeds other than the evil ones, i. e. of good\ndeeds), but on the fall (of the body, i.e. when death takes place).\' The last\nwords of the Sutra, \'but on the fall,\' are separated by _S_ a _n_ kara from\nthe preceding part of the Sutra and interpreted to mean, \'when death takes\nplace (there results mukti of\n\np. lxxviii\n\nthe vidvan, who through his knowledge has freed himself from the bonds of\nworks).\'--According to Ramanu _g_ a the whole Sutra simply means, \'There is\nlikewise non-attachment of good deeds (not at once when knowledge is reached),\nbut on the death of the vidvan 1.\'\n\nAdhik. XI (15).--The non-operation of works stated in the two preceding\nadhikara _n_ as holds good only in the case of anarabdhakarya works, i.e.\nthose works which have not yet begun to produce their effects, while it does\nnot extend to the arabdhakarya works on which the present existence of the\ndevotee depends.\n\nAdhik. XII (16, 17).--From the rule enunciated in Adhik. X are excepted such\nsacrificial performances as are enjoined permanently (nitya): so, for\ninstance, the agnihotra, for they promote the origination of knowledge.\n\nAdhik. XIII (18).--The origination of knowledge is promoted also by such\nsacrificial works as are not accompanied with the knowledge of the upasanas\nreferring to the different members of those works.\n\nAdhik. XIV (19).--The arabdhakarya works have to be worked out fully by the\nfruition of their effects; whereupon the vidvan becomes united with Brahman.--\nThe \'bhoga\' of the Sutra is, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, restricted to the\npresent existence of the devotee, since the complete knowledge obtained by him\ndestroys the nescience which otherwise would lead to future embodiments.\nAccording to Ramanu _g_ a a number of embodied existences may have to be gone\nthrough before the effects of the arabdhakarya works are exhausted.\n\n### P\xc3\x82DA II.\n\nThis and the two remaining padas of the fourth adhyaya describe the fate of\nthe vidvan after death. According to _S_ a _n_ kara we have to distinguish the\nvidvan who possesses the highest knowledge, viz. that he is one with the\nhighest\n\np. xxix\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman, and the vidvan who knows only the lower\nBrahman, and have to refer certain Sutras to the former and others to the\nlatter. According to Ramanu _g_ a the vidvan is one only.\n\nAdhik. I, II, III (1-6).--On the death of the vidvan (i.e. of him who\npossesses the lower knowledge, according to _S_ a _n_ kara) his senses are\nmerged in the manas, the manas in the chief vital air (pra _n_ a), the vital\nair in the individual soul ( _g_ iva), the soul in the subtle elements.--\nAccording to Ramanu _g_ a the combination (sampatti) of the senses with the\nmanas, &c. is a mere conjunction (sa _m_ yoga), not a merging (laya).\n\nAdhik. IV (7).--The vidvan (i.e. according to _S_ a _n_ kara, he who possesses\nthe lower knowledge) and the avidvan, i.e. he who does not possess any\nknowledge of Brahman, pass through the same stages (i.e. those described\nhitherto) up to the entrance of the soul, together with the subtle elements,\nand so on into the na _d_ is.--The vidvan also remains connected with the\nsubtle elements because he has not yet completely destroyed avidya, so that\nthe immortality which Scripture ascribes to him (am _ri_ tatva _m_ hi vidvan\nabhya _s_ nute) is only a relative one.--Ramanu _g_ a quotes the following\ntext regarding the immortality of the vidvan:\n\n\'Yada sarve pramu _k_ yante kama ye # sya h _ri_ di sthita _h_  \natha martyo # m _ri_ to bhavaty atra brahma sama _s_ nute,\'\n\nand explains that the immortality which is here ascribed to the vidvan as soon\nas he abandons all desires can only mean the destruction--mentioned in the\npreceding pada--of all the effects of good and evil works, while the \'reaching\nof Brahman\' can only refer to the intuition of Brahman vouchsafed to the\nmeditating devotee.\n\nAdhik. V (8-11) raises; according to _S_ a _n_ kara, the question whether the\nsubtle elements of which Scripture says that they are combined with the\nhighest deity (te _g_ a _h_ parasya _m_ devatayam) are completely merged in\nthe latter or not. The answer is that a complete absorption of the elements\ntakes place only when final emancipation is reached; that, on the other hand,\nas long as the sa _m_ sara state lasts, the elements, although somehow\ncombined with\n\np. lxxx\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman, remain distinct so as to be able to form new\nbodies for the soul.\n\nAccording to Ramanu _g_ a the Sutras 8-11 do not constitute a new adhikara _n_\na, but continue the discussion of the point mooted in 7. The immortality there\nspoken of does not imply the separation of the soul from the body, \'because\nScripture declares sa _m_ sara, i. e. embodiedness up to the reaching of\nBrahman\' (tasya tavad eva _k_ ira _m_ yavan na vimokshye atha sampatsye) (8).\n--That the soul after having departed from the gross body-is not disconnected\nfrom the subtle elements, is also proved hereby, that the subtle body\naccompanies it, as is observed from authority 1 (9).--Hence the immortality\nreferred to in the scriptural passage quoted is not effected by means of the\ntotal destruction of the body (10).\n\nAdhik. VI (12-14) is of special importance.--According to _S_ a _n_ kara the\nSutras now turn from the discussion of the departure of him who possesses the\nlower knowledge only to the consideration of what becomes of him who has\nreached the higher knowledge. So far it has been taught that in the case of\nrelative immortality (ensuing on the apara vidya) the subtle elements,\ntogether with the senses and so on, depart from the body of the dying devotee;\nthis implies at the same time that they do not depart from the body of the\ndying sage who knows himself to be one with Brahman.--Against this latter\nimplied doctrine Sutra 12 is supposed to formulate an objection. \'If it be\nsaid that the departure of the pra _n_ as from the body of the dying sage is\ndenied (viz. in B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 5, na tasya pra _n_ a utkramanti, of him\nthe pra _n_ as do not pass out); we reply that in that passage the genitive\n"tasya" has the sense of the ablative "tasmat," so that the sense of the\npassage is, "from him, i.e. from the _g_ iva of the dying sage, the pra _n_ as\ndo not depart, but remain with it."--This objection _S_ a _n_ kara supposes to\nbe disposed of in Sutra 13. \'By some there is given a clear denial of the\ndeparture of the pra _n_ as in the case of the\n\np. lxxxi\n\ndying sage,\' viz. in the passage B _ri_. Up. III, 2, 11, where Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya\ninstructs \xc3\x82rtabhaga that, when this man dies, the pra _n_ as do not depart\nfrom it (asmat; the context showing that asmat means \'from it,\' viz. from the\nbody, and not \'from him,\' viz. the _g_ iva).--The same view is, moreover,\nconfirmed by Sm _ri_ ti passages.\n\nAccording to Ramanu _g_ a the three Sutras forming _S_ a _n_ kara\'s sixth\nadhikara _n_ a do not constitute a new adhikara _n_ a at all, and, moreover,\nhave to be combined into two Sutras. The topic continuing to be discussed is\nthe utkranti of the vidvan. If, Sutra 12 says, the utkranti of the pra _n_ as\nis not admitted, on the ground of the denial supposed to be contained in B\n_ri_. Up. IV, 4, 5; the reply is that the sense of the tasya there is \' _s_\narirat\' (so that the passage means, \'from him, i.e. the _g_ iva, the pra _n_\nas do not depart\'); for this is clearly shown by the reading of some, viz. the\nMadhyandinas, who, in their text of the passage, do not read \'tasya\' but\n\'tasmat.\'--With reference to the instruction given by Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya to\n\xc3\x82rtabhaga, it is to be remarked that nothing there shows the \'ayam purusha\' to\nbe the sage who knows Brahman.--And, finally, there are Sm _ri_ ti passages\ndeclaring that the sage also when dying departs from the body.\n\nAdhik. VII and VIII (15, 16) teach, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, that, on the\ndeath of him who possesses the higher knowledge, his pra _n_ as, elements, &c.\nare merged in Brahman, so as to be no longer distinct from it in any way.\n\nAccording to Ramanu _g_ a the two Sutras continue the teaching about the pra\n_n_ as, bhutas, &c. of the vidvan in general, and declare that they are\nfinally merged in Brahman, not merely in the way of conjunction (sa _m_ yoga),\nbut completely 1.\n\nAdhik. IX (17).-- _S_ a _n_ kara here returns to the owner of the apara vidya,\nwhile Ramanu _g_ a continues the description of the utkranti of his vidvan.--\nThe _g_ iva of the dying man\n\np. lxxxii\n\npasses into the heart, and thence departs out of the body by means of the na\n_d_ is; the vidvan by means of the na _d_ i called sushum _n_ a, the avidvan\nby means of some other na _d_ i.\n\nAdhik. X (18, 19).--The departing soul passes up to the sun by means of a ray\nof light which exists at night as well as during day.\n\nAdhik. XI (20, 21).--Also that vidvan who dies during the dakshi _n_ ayana\nreaches Brahman.\n\n### P\xc3\x82DA III.\n\nAdhik. I, II, III (1-3) reconcile the different accounts given in the\nUpanishads as to the stations of the way which leads the vidvan up to Brahman.\n\nAdhik. IV (4-6)-By the \'stations\' we have, however, to understand not only the\nsubdivisions of the way but also the divine beings which lead the soul on.\n\nThe remaining part of the pada is by _S_ a _n_ kara divided into two adhikara\n_n_ as. Of these the former one (7-14) teaches that the Brahman to which the\ndeparted soul is led by the guardians of the path of the gods is not the\nhighest Brahman, but the effected (karya) or qualified ( _s_ agu _n_ a)\nBrahman. This is the opinion propounded in Sutras 7-11 by Badari, and,\nfinally, accepted by _S_ a _n_ kara in his commentary on Sutra 14. In Sutras\n12-14 _G_ aimini defends the opposite view, according to which the soul of the\nvidvan goes to the highest Brahman, not to the karyam brahma. But _G_ aimini\'s\nview, although set forth in the latter part of the adhikara _n_ a, is,\naccording to _S_ a _n_ kara, a mere purvapaksha, while Badari\'s opinion\nrepresents the siddhanta.--The latter of the two adhikara _n_ as (VI of the\nwhole pada; 15,16) records the opinion of Badaraya _n_ a on a collateral\nquestion, viz. whether, or not, all those who worship the effected Brahman are\nled to it. The decision is that those only are guided to Brahman who have not\nworshipped it under a pratika form.\n\nAccording to Ramanu _g_ a, Sutras 7-16 form one adhikara _n_ a only, in which\nthe views of Badari and of _G_ aimini represent two purvapakshas, while\nBadaraya _n_ a\'s opinion is adopted\n\np. lxxxiii\n\nas the siddhanta. The question is whether the guardians of the path lead to\nBrahman only those who worship the effected Brahman, i.e. Hira _n_ yagarbha,\nor those who worship the highest Brahman, or those who worship the individual\nsoul as free from Prak _ri_ ti, and having Brahman for its Self (ye\npratyagatmana _m_ prak _ri_ tiviyukta _m_ brahmatmakam upasate).--The first\nview is maintained by Badari in Sutra 7, \'The guardians lead to Brahman those\nwho worship the effected Brahman, because going is possible towards the latter\nonly;\' for no movement can take place towards the highest and as such\nomnipresent Brahman.--The explanation of Sutra 9 is similar to that of _S_ a\n_n_ kara; but more clearly replies to the objection (that, if Hira _n_\nyagarbha were meant in the passage, \'purusho#manava _h_ sa etan brahma\ngamayati,\' the text would read \'sa etan brahma _n_ am gamayati\') that Hira _n_\nyagarbha is called Brahman on account of his nearness to Brahman, i.e. on\naccount of his prathama _g_ atva.---The explanation of 10, 11 is essentially\nthe same as in _S_ a _n_ kara; so also of 12-14.--The siddhanta view is\nestablished in Sutra 13, \'It is the opinion of Badaraya _n_ a that it, i.e.\nthe ga _n_ a of the guardians, leads to Brahman those who do not take their\nstand on what is pratika, i.e. those who worship the highest Brahman, and\nthose who meditate on the individual Self as dissociated from prak _ri_ ti,\nand having Brahman for its Self, but not those who worship Brahman under\npratikas. For both views--that of _G_ aimini as well as that of Badari--are\nfaulty.\' The karya view contradicts such passages as \'asma _k_ _kh_ arirat\nsamutthaya para _m_ _g_ yotir upasampadya,\' &c.; the para view, such passages\nas that in the pa _\xc3\xb1 k_agni-vidya, which declares that ya ittha _m_ vidu _h_ ,\ni.e. those who know the pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ agni-vidya, are also led up to Brahman.\n\n### P\xc3\x82DA IV.\n\nAdhik. I (1-3) returns, according to-- _S_ a _n_ kara, to the owner of the\npara vidya, and teaches that, when on his death his soul obtains final\nrelease, it does not acquire any new characteristics, but merely manifests\nitself in its true nature.--The explanation given by Ramanu _g_ a is\nessentially\n\np. lxxxiv\n\nthe same, but of course refers to that vidvan whose going to Brahman had been\ndescribed in the preceding pada.\n\nAdhik. II (4) determines that the relation in which the released soul stands\nto Brahman is that of avibhaga, non-separation. This, on _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\nview, means absolute non-separation, identity.--According to Ramanuga the\nquestion to be considered is whether the released soul views itself as\nseparate (p _ri_ thagbhuta) from Brahman, or as non-separate because being a\nmode of Brahman. The former view is favoured by those Sruti and Sm _ri_ ti\npassages which speak of the soul as being with, or equal to, Brahman; the\nlatter by, such passages as tat tvam asi and the like. 1\n\nAdhik. Ill (5-7) discusses the characteristics of the released soul (i.e. of\nthe truly released soul, according to _S_ a _n_ kara). According to _G_ aimini\nthe released soul, when manifesting itself in its true nature, possesses all\nthose qualities which in _Kh._ Up. VIII, _7_ , I and other places are ascribed\nto Brahman, such as apahatapapmatva, satyasa _m_ kalpatva, &c., ai _s_ varya.\n--According to Au _d_ ulomi the only characteristic of the released soul is\n_k_ aitanya.--According to Badarayana the two views can be combined ( _S_ a\n_n_ kara remarking that satyasa _m_ kalpatva, &c. are ascribed to the released\nsoul vyavaharapekshaya).\n\nAdhik. IV (8-9) returns, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, to the apara vidya, and\ndiscusses the question whether the soul of\n\np. lxxxv\n\nthe pious effects its desires by its mere determination, or uses some other\nmeans. The former alternative is accepted--According to Ramanu _g_ a the\nadhikara _n_ a simply continues the consideration of the state of the\nreleased, begun in the preceding adhikara _n_ a. Of the released soul it is\nsaid in _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 3 that after it has manifested itself in its true\nnature it moves about playing and rejoicing with women, carriages, and so on.\nThe question then arises whether it effects all this by its mere sa _m_ kalpa\n(it having been shown in the preceding adhikara _n_ a that the released soul\nis, like the Lord, satyasa _m_ kalpa), or not. The answer is in favour of the\nformer alternative, on account of the explicit declaration made in _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 2, \'By his mere will the fathers come to receive him.\'\n\nAdhik. V (10-14) decides that the released are embodied or disembodied\naccording to their wish and will.\n\nAdhik. VI (11, 12) explains how the soul of the released can animate several\nbodies at the same time.--Sutra 12 gives, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, the\nadditional explanation that those passages which declare the absence of all\nspecific cognition on the part of the released soul do not refer to the partly\nreleased soul of the devotee, but either to the soul in the state of deep\nsleep (svapyaya = sushupti), or to the fully released soul of the sage\n(sampatti = kaivalya).--Ramanu _g_ a explains that the passages speaking of\nabsence of consciousness refer either to the state of deep sleep, or to the\ntime of dying (sampatti = mara _n_ am according to \'va _n_ manasi sampadyate,\'\n&c.).\n\nAdhik. VII (17-21).--The released _g_ ivas participate in all the perfections\nand powers of the Lord, with the exception of the power of creating and\nsustaining the world. They do not return to new forms of embodied existence.\n\n\n\nAfter having, in this way, rendered ourselves acquainted with the contents of\nthe Brahma-sutras according to the views of _S_ a _n_ kara as well as Ramanu\n_g_ a, we have now to consider the question which of the two modes of\ninterpretation represents--or at any rate more closely approximates to--the\ntrue meaning of the Sutras. That\n\np. lxxxvi\n\nfew of the Sutras are intelligible if taken by themselves, we have already\nremarked above; but this does not exclude the possibility of our deciding with\na fair degree of certainty which of the two interpretations proposed agrees\nbetter with the text, at least in a certain number of cases.\n\nWe have to note in the first place that, in spite of very numerous\ndiscrepancies,--of which only the more important ones have been singled out in\nthe conspectus of contents,--the two commentators are at one as to the general\ndrift of the Sutras and the arrangement of topics. As a rule, the adhikara _n_\nas discuss one or several Vedic passages bearing upon a certain point of the\nsystem, and in the vast majority of cases the two commentators agree as to\nwhich are the special texts referred to. And, moreover, in a very large number\nof cases the agreement extends to the interpretation to be put on those\npassages and on the Sutras. This far-reaching agreement certainly tends to\ninspire us with a certain confidence as to the existence of an old tradition\nconcerning the meaning of the Sutras on which the bulk of the interpretations\nof _S_ a _n_ kara as well as of Ramanu _g_ a are based.\n\nBut at the same time we have seen that, in a not inconsiderable number of\ncases, the interpretations of _S_ a _n_ kara and Ramanu _g_ a diverge more or\nless widely, and that the Sutras affected thereby are, most of them,\nespecially important because bearing on fundamental points of the Vedanta\nsystem. The question then remains which of the two interpretations is entitled\nto preference.\n\nRegarding a small number of Sutras I have already (in the conspectus of\ncontents) given it as my opinion that Ramanu _g_ a\'s explanation appears to be\nmore worthy of consideration. We meet, in the first place, with a number of\ncases in which the two commentators agree as to the literal meaning of a\nSutra, but where _S_ a _n_ kara sees himself reduced to the necessity of\nsupplementing his interpretation by certain additions and reservations of his\nown for which the text gives no occasion, while Ramanu _g_ a is able to take\nthe Sutra as it stands. To exemplify this remark, I again direct attention to\nall those Sutras which in\n\np. lxxxvii\n\nclear terms represent the individual soul as something different from the\nhighest soul, and concerning which _S_ a _n_ kara is each time obliged to have\nrecourse to the plea of the Sutra referring, not to what is true in the strict\nsense of the word, but only to what is conventionally looked upon as true. It\nis, I admit, not altogether impossible that _S_ a _n_ kara\'s interpretation\nshould represent the real meaning of the Sutras; that the latter, indeed, to\nuse the terms employed by Dr. Deussen, should for the nonce set forth an\nexoteric doctrine adapted to the common notions of mankind, which, however,\ncan be rightly understood by him only to whose mind the esoteric doctrine is\nall the while present. This is not impossible, I say; but it is a point which\nrequires convincing proofs before it can be allowed.--We have had, in the\nsecond place, to note a certain number of adhikara _n_ as and Sutras\nconcerning whose interpretation _S_ a _n_ kara and Ramanu _g_ a disagree\naltogether; and we have seen that not unfrequently the explanations given by\nthe latter commentator appear to be preferable because falling in more easily\nwith the words of the text. The most striking instance of this is afforded by\nthe 13th adhikara _n_ a of II, 3, which treats of the size of the _g_ iva, and\nwhere Ramanu _g_ a\'s explanation seems to be decidedly superior to _S_ a _n_\nkara\'s, both if we look to the arrangement of the whole adhikara _n_ a and to\nthe wording of the single Sutras. The adhikara _n_ a is, moreover, a specially\nimportant one, because the nature of the view held as to the size of the\nindividual soul goes far to settle the question what kind of Vedanta is\nembodied in Badaraya _n_ a\'s work.\n\nBut it will be requisite not only to dwell on the interpretations of a few\ndetached Sutras, but to make the attempt at least of forming some opinion as\nto the relation of the Vedanta-sutras as a whole to the chief distinguishing\ndoctrines of _S_ a _n_ kara as well as Ramanu _g_ a. Such an attempt may\npossibly lead to very slender positive results; but in the present state of\nthe enquiry even a merely negative result, viz. the conclusion that the Sutras\ndo not teach particular doctrines found in them by certain commentators, will\nnot be without its value.\n\np. lxxxviii\n\nThe first question we wish to consider in some detail is whether the Sutras in\nany way favour _S_ a _n_ kara\'s doctrine that we have to distinguish a twofold\nknowledge of Brahman, a higher knowledge which leads to the immediate\nabsorption, on death, of the individual soul in Brahman, and a lower knowledge\nwhich raises its owner merely to an exalted form of individual existence. The\nadhyaya first to be considered in this connexion is the fourth one. According\nto _S_ a _n_ kara the three latter padas of that adhyaya are chiefly engaged\nin describing the fate of him who dies in the possession of the lower\nknowledge, while two sections (IV, 2, 12-14; IV, 4, 1-7) tell us what happens\nto him who, before his death, had risen to the knowledge of the highest\nBrahman. According to Ramanu _g_ a, on the other hand, the three padas,\nreferring throughout to one subject only, give an uninterrupted account of the\nsuccessive steps by which the soul of him who knows the Lord through the\nUpanishads passes, at the time of death, out of the gross body which it had\ntenanted, ascends to the world of Brahman, and lives there for ever without\nreturning into the sa _m_ sara.\n\nOn an a priori view of the matter it certainly appears somewhat strange that\nthe concluding section of the Sutras should be almost entirely taken up with\ndescribing the fate of him who has after all acquired an altogether inferior\nknowledge only, and has remained shut out from the true sanctuary of Vedantic\nknowledge, while the fate of the fully initiated is disposed of in a few\noccasional Sutras. It is, I think, not too much to say that no unbiassed\nstudent of the Sutras would--before having allowed himself to be influenced by\n_S_ a _n_ kara\'s interpretations--imagine for a moment that the solemn words,\n\'From thence is no return, from thence is no return,\' with which the Sutras\nconclude, are meant to describe, not the lasting condition of him who has\nreached final release, the highest aim of man, but merely a stage on the way\nof that soul which is engaged in the slow progress of gradual release, a stage\nwhich is indeed greatly superior to any earthly form of existence, but yet\nitself belongs to the essentially fictitious sa _m_ sara.\n\np. lxxxix\n\nand as such remains infinitely below the bliss of true mukti. And this a\npriori impression--which, although no doubt significant, could hardly be\nappealed to as decisive--is confirmed by a detailed consideration of the two\nsets of Sutras which _S_ a _n_ kara connects with the knowledge of the higher\nBrahman. How these Sutras are interpreted by _S_ a _n_ kara and Ramanu _g_ a\nhas been stated above in the conspectus of contents; the points which render\nthe interpretation given by Ramanu _g_ a more probable are as follows. With\nregard to IV, 2, 12-14, we have to note, in the first place, the circumstance\n--relevant although not decisive in itself--that Sutra 12 does not contain any\nindication of a new topic being introduced. In the second place, it can hardly\nbe doubted that the text of Sutra 13, \'spash _t_ o hy ekesham,\' is more\nappropriately understood, with Ramanu _g_ a, as furnishing a reason for the\nopinion advanced in the preceding Sutra, than--with _S_ a _n_ kara--as\nembodying the refutation of a previous statement (in which latter case we\nshould expect not \'hi\' but \'tu\'). And, in the third place, the \'eke,\' i.e.\n\'some,\' referred to in Sutra 13 would, on _S_ a _n_ kara\'s interpretation,\ndenote the very same persons to whom the preceding Sutra had referred, viz.\nthe followers of the Ka _n_ va- _s_ akha (the two Vedic passages referred to\nin 12 and 13 being B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 5, and III, 2, 11, according to the Ka\n_n_ va recension); while it is the standing practice of the Sutras to\nintroduce, by means of the designation \'eke,\' members of Vedic _s_ akhas,\nteachers, &c. other than those alluded to in the preceding Sutras. With this\npractice Ramanu _g_ a\'s interpretation, on the other hand, fully agrees; for,\naccording to him, the \'eke\' are the Madhyandinas, whose reading in B _ri_. Up.\nIV, 4, 5, viz. \'tasmat,\' clearly indicates that the \'tasya\' in the\ncorresponding passage of the Ka _n_ vas denotes the _s_ arira, i.e. the _g_\niva. I think it is not saying too much that _S_ a _n_ kara\'s explanation,\naccording to which the \'eke\' would denote the very same Ka _n_ vas to whom the\npreceding Sutra had referred--so that the Ka _n_ vas would be distinguished\nfrom themselves as it were--is altogether impossible.\n\nThe result of this closer consideration of the first set of\n\np. xc\n\n[paragraph continues] Sutras, alleged by _S_ a _n_ kara to concern the owner\nof the higher knowledge of Brahman, entitles us to view with some distrust--\n_S_ a _n_ kara\'s assertion that another set also--IV, 4, l-7--has to be\ndetached from the general topic of the fourth adhyaya, and to be understood as\ndepicting the condition of those who have obtained final absolute release. And\nthe Sutras themselves do not tend to weaken this preliminary want of\nconfidence. In the first place their wording also gives no indication whatever\nof their having to be separated from what precedes as well as what follows.\nAnd, in the second place, the last Sutra of the set (7) obliges _S_ a _n_ kara\nto ascribe to his truly released souls qualities which clearly cannot belong\nto them; so that he finally is obliged to make the extraordinary statement\nthat those qualities belong to them \'vyavaharapekshaya,\' while yet the purport\nof the whole adhikara _n_ a is said to be the description of the truly\nreleased soul for which no vyavahara exists! Very truly _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\ncommentator here remarks, \'atra ke _k_ in muhyanti akha _nd_ a _k_ inmatra _g\n\xc3\xb1_anan muktasya _g \xc3\xb1_anabhavat kuta a _g \xc3\xb1_anikadharmayoga _h_ ,\' and the way\nin which thereupon he himself attempts to get over the difficulty certainly\ndoes not improve matters.\n\nIn connexion with the two passages discussed, we meet in the fourth adhyaya\nwith another passage, which indeed has no direct bearing on the distinction of\napara and para vidya, but may yet be shortly referred to in this place as\nanother and altogether undoubted instance of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s interpretations\nnot always agreeing with the text of the Sutras. The Sutras 7-16 of the third\npada state the opinions of three different teachers on the question to which\nBrahman the soul of the vidvan repairs on death, or--according to Ramanu _g_ a\n--the worshippers of which Brahman repair to (the highest) Brahman. Ramanu _g_\na treats the views of Badari and _G_ aimini as two purvapakshas, and the\nopinion of Badaraya _n_ a--which is stated last--as the siddhanta. _S_ a _n_\nkara, on the other hand, detaching the Sutras in which Badaraya _n_ a\'s view\nis set forth from the preceding part of the adhikara _n_ a (a proceeding\nwhich, although not\n\np. xci\n\nplausible, yet cannot be said to be altogether illegitimate), maintains that\nBadari\'s view, which is expounded first, represents the siddhanta, while _G_\naimini\'s view, set forth subsequently, is to be considered a mere purvapaksha.\nThis, of course, is altogether inadmissible, it being the invariable practice\nof the Vedanta-sutras as well as the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras to conclude the\ndiscussion of contested points with the statement of that view which is to be\naccepted as the authoritative one. This is so patent that _S_ a _n_ kara feels\nhimself called upon to defend his deviation from the general rule (Commentary\non IV, 4, 13), without, however, bringing forward any arguments but such as\nare valid only if _S_ a _n_ kara\'s system itself is already accepted.\n\nThe previous considerations leave us, I am inclined to think, no choice but to\nside with Ramanu _g_ a as to the general subject-matter of the fourth adhyaya\nof the Sutras. We need not accept him as our guide in all particular\ninterpretations, but we must acknowledge with him that the Sutras of the\nfourth adhyaya describe the ultimate fate of one and the same vidvan, and do\nnot afford any basis for the distinction of a higher and lower knowledge of\nBrahman in _S_ a _n_ kara\'s sense.\n\nIf we have not to discriminate between a lower and a higher knowledge of\nBrahman, it follows that the distinction of a lower and a higher Brahman is\nlikewise not valid. But this is not a point to be decided at once on the\nnegative evidence of the fourth adhyaya, but regarding which the entire body\nof the Vedanta-sutras has to be consulted. And intimately connected with this\ninvestigation--in fact, one with it from a certain point of view--is the\nquestion whether the Sutras afford any evidence of their author having held\nthe doctrine of Maya, the principle of illusion, by the association with which\nthe highest Brahman, in itself transcending all qualities, appears as the\nlower Brahman or \xc3\x8e _s_ vara. That Ramanu _g_ a denies the distinction of the\ntwo Brahmans and the doctrine of Maya we have seen above; we shall, however,\nin the subsequent investigation, pay less attention to his views and\ninterpretations\n\np. xcii\n\nthan to the indications furnished by the Sutras themselves.\n\nPlacing myself at the point of view of a _S_ a _n_ kara, I am startled at the\noutset by the second Sutra of the first adhyaya, which undertakes to give a\ndefinition of Brahman. \'Brahman is that whence the origination and so on (i.e.\nthe sustentation and reabsorption) of this world proceed.\' What, we must ask,\nis this Sutra meant to define?--That Brahman, we are inclined to answer, whose\ncognition the first Sutra declares to constitute the task of the entire\nVedanta; that Brahman whose cognition is the only road to final release; that\nBrahman in fact which _S_ a _n_ kara calls the highest.--But, here we must\nobject to ourselves, the highest Brahman is not properly defined as that from\nwhich the world originates. In later Vedantic writings, whose authors were\nclearly conscious of the distinction of the higher absolute Brahman and the\nlower Brahman related to Maya or the world, we meet with definitions of\nBrahman of an altogether different type. I need only remind the reader of the\ncurrent definition of Brahman as sa _k_ - _k_ id-ananda, or, to mention one\nindividual instance, refer to the introductory _s_ lokas of the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_ada\n_s_ i dilating on the sa _m_ vid svayamprabha, the self-luminous principle of\nthought which in all time, past or future, neither starts into being nor\nperishes (P. D. I, 7). \'That from which the world proceeds\' can by a _S_ a _n_\nkara be accepted only as a definition of \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, of Brahman which by its\nassociation with Maya is enabled to project the false appearance of this\nworld, and it certainly is as improbable that the Sutras should open with a\ndefinition of that inferior principle, from whose cognition there can accrue\nno permanent benefit, as, according to a remark made above, it is unlikely\nthat they should conclude with a description of the state of those who know\nthe lower Brahman only, and thus are debarred from obtaining true release. As\nsoon, on the other hand, as we discard the idea of a twofold Brahman and\nconceive Brahman as one only, as the all-enfolding being which sometimes emits\nthe world from its own substance and sometimes again retracts it into itself,\never remaining one in all its\n\np. xciii\n\nvarious manifestations--a conception which need not by any means be modelled\nin all its details on the views of the Ramanu _g_ as--the definition of\nBrahman given in the second Sutra becomes altogether unobjectionable.\n\nWe next enquire whether the impression left on the mind by the manner in which\nBadaraya _n_ a defines Brahman, viz. that he does not distinguish between an\nabsolute Brahman and a Brahman associated with Maya, is confirmed or weakened\nby any other parts of his work. The Sutras being throughout far from direct in\ntheir enunciations, we shall have to look less to particular terms and turns\nof expression than to general lines of reasoning. What in this connexion seems\nspecially worthy of being taken into account, is the style of argumentation\nemployed by the Sutrakara against the Sa _n_ khya doctrine, which maintains\nthat the world has originated, not from an intelligent being, but from the\nnon-intelligent pradhana. The most important Sutras relative to this point are\nto be met with in the first pada of the second adhyaya. Those Sutras are\nindeed almost unintelligible if taken by themselves, but the unanimity of the\ncommentators as to their meaning enables us to use them as steps in our\ninvestigation. The sixth Sutra of the pada mentioned replies to the Sa _n_\nkhya objection that the non-intelligent world cannot spring from an\nintelligent principle, by the remark that \'it is thus seen,\' i.e. it is a\nmatter of common observation that non-intelligent things are produced from\nbeings endowed with intelligence; hair and nails, for instance, springing from\nanimals, and certain insects from dung.--Now, an argumentation of this kind is\naltogether out of place from the point of view of the true _S_ a _n_ kara.\nAccording to the latter the non-intelligent world does not spring from Brahman\nin so far as the latter is intelligence, but in so far as it is associated\nwith Maya. Maya is the upadana of the material world, and Maya itself is of a\nnon-intelligent nature, owing to which it is by so many Vedantic writers\nidentified with the prak _ri_ ti of the Sa _n_ khyas. Similarly the\nillustrative instances, adduced under Sutra 9 for the purpose of showing that\neffects when being reabsorbed into their causal substances\n\np. xciv\n\ndo not impart to the latter their own qualities, and that hence the material\nworld also, when being refunded into Brahman, does not impart to it its own\nimperfections, are singularly inappropriate if viewed in connexion with the\ndoctrine of Maya, according to which the material world is no more in Brahman\nat the time of a pralaya than during the period of its subsistence. According\nto _S_ a _n_ kara the world is not merged in Brahman, but the special forms\ninto which the upadana of the world, i.e. Maya, had modified itself are merged\nin non-distinct Maya, whose relation to Brahman is not changed thereby.--The\nillustration, again, given in Sutra 24 of the mode in which Brahman, by means\nof its inherent power, transforms itself into the world without employing any\nextraneous instruments of action, \'kshiravad dhi,\' \'as milk (of its own accord\nturns into curds),\' would be strangely chosen indeed if meant to bring nearer\nto our understanding the mode in which Brahman projects the illusive\nappearance of the world; and also the analogous instance given in the Sutra\nnext following, \'as Gods and the like (create palaces, chariots, &c. by the\nmere power of their will)\'--which refers to the real creation of real things--\nwould hardly be in its place if meant to illustrate a theory which considers\nunreality to be the true character of the world. The mere cumulation of the\ntwo essentially heterogeneous illustrative instances (kshiravad dhi;\ndevadivat), moreover, seems to show that the writer who had recourse to them\nheld no very definite theory as to the particular mode in which the world\nsprings from Brahman, but was merely concerned to render plausible in some way\nor other that an intelligent being can give rise to what is non-intelligent\nwithout having recourse to any extraneous means 1.\n\nThat the Maya doctrine was not present to the mind of the Sutrakara, further\nappears from the latter part of the fourth pada of the first adhyaya, where it\nis shown that Brahman is not only the operative but also the material cause of\nthe world. If anywhere, there would have been\n\np. xcv\n\nthe place to indicate, had such been the author\'s view, that Brahman is the\nmaterial cause of the world through Maya only, and that the world is unreal;\nbut the Sutras do not contain a single word to that effect. Sutra 26, on the\nother hand, exhibits the significant term \'pari _n_ amat;\' Brahman produces\nthe world by means of a modification of itself. It is well known that later\non, when the terminology of the Vedanta became definitely settled, the term\n\'pari _n_ amavada\' was used to denote that very theory to which the followers\nof _S_ a _n_ kara are most violently opposed, viz. the doctrine according to\nwhich the world is not a mere vivarta, i.e. an illusory manifestation of\nBrahman, but the effect of Brahman undergoing a real change, may that change\nbe conceived to take place in the way taught by Ramanu _g_ a or in some other\nmanner.--With regard to the last-quoted Sutra, as well as to those touched\nupon above, the commentators indeed maintain that whatever terms and modes of\nexpression are apparently opposed to the vivartavada are in reality\nreconcilable with it; to Sutra 26, for instance, Govindananda remarks that the\nterm \'pari _n_ ama\' only denotes an effect in general (karyamatra), without\nimplying that the effect is real. But in cases of this nature we are fully\nentitled to use our own judgment, even if we were not compelled to do so by\nthe fact that other commentators, such as Ramanu _g_ a, are satisfied to take\n\'pari _n_ ama\' and similar terms in their generally received sense.\n\nA further section treating of the nature of Brahman is met with in III, 2, 11\nff. It is, according to _S_ a _n_ kara\'s view, of special importance, as it is\nalleged to set forth that Brahman is in itself destitute of all qualities, and\nis affected with qualities only through its limiting adjuncts (upadhis), the\noffspring of Maya. I have above (in the conspectus of contents) given a\nsomewhat detailed abstract of the whole section as interpreted by _S_ a _n_\nkara on the one hand, and Ramanu _g_ a on the other hand, from which it\nappears that the latter\'s opinion as to the purport of the group of Sutras\nwidely diverges from that of _S_ a _n_ kara. The wording of the Sutras is so\neminently concise and vague that I find it impossible to decide which of the\ntwo commentators--if\n\np. xcvi\n\nindeed either--is to be accepted as a trustworthy guide; regarding the sense\nof some Sutras _S_ a _n_ kara\'s explanation seems to deserve preference, in\nthe case of others Ramanu _g_ a seems to keep closer to the text. I decidedly\nprefer, for instance, Ramanu _g_ a\'s interpretation of Sutra 22, as far as the\nsense of the entire Sutra is concerned, and more especially with regard to the\nterm \'prak _ri_ taitavattvam,\' whose proper force is brought out by Ramanu _g_\na\'s explanation only. So much is certain that none of the Sutras decidedly\nfavours the interpretation proposed by _S_ a _n_ kara. Whichever commentator\nwe follow, we greatly miss coherence and strictness of reasoning, and it is\nthus by no means improbable that the section is one of those--perhaps not few\nin number--in which both interpreters had less regard to the literal sense of\nthe words and to tradition than to their desire of forcing Badaraya _n_ a\'s\nSutras to bear testimony to the truth of their own philosophic theories.\n\nWith special reference to the Maya doctrine one important Sutra has yet to be\nconsidered, the only one in which the term \'maya\' itself occurs, viz. III, 2,\n3. According to _S_ a _n_ kara the Sutra signifies that the environments of\nthe dreaming soul are not real but mere Maya, i.e. unsubstantial illusion,\nbecause they do not fully manifest the character of real objects. Ramanu _g_ a\n(as we have seen in the conspectus) gives a different explanation of the term\n\'maya,\' but in judging of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s views we may for the time accept\n_S_ a _n_ kara\'s own interpretation. Now, from the latter it clearly follows\nthat if the objects seen in dreams are to be called Maya, i.e. illusion,\nbecause not evincing the characteristics of reality, the objective world\nsurrounding the waking soul must not be called Maya. But that the world\nperceived by waking men is Maya, even in a higher sense than the world\npresented to the dreaming consciousness, is an undoubted tenet of the _S_ a\n_n_ kara Vedanta; and the Sutra therefore proves either that Badaraya _n_ a\ndid not hold the doctrine of the illusory character of the world, or else\nthat, if after all he did hold that doctrine, he used the term \'maya\' in a\nsense altogether different from that\n\np. xcvii\n\nin which _S_ a _n_ kara employs it.--If, on the other hand, we, with Ramanu\n_g_ a, understand the word \'maya\' to denote a wonderful thing, the Sutra of\ncourse has no bearing whatever on the doctrine of Maya in its later technical\nsense.\n\nWe now turn to the question as to the relation of the individual soul to\nBrahman. Do the Sutras indicate anywhere that their author held _S_ a _n_\nkara\'s doctrine, according to which the _g_ iva is in reality identical with\nBrahman, and separated from it, as it were, only by a false surmise due to\navidya, or do they rather favour the view that the souls, although they have\nsprung from Brahman, and constitute elements of its nature, yet enjoy a kind\nof individual existence apart from it? This question is in fact only another\naspect of the Maya question, but yet requires a short separate treatment.\n\nIn the conspectus I have given it as my opinion that the Sutras in which the\nsize of the individual soul is discussed can hardly be understood in _S_ a _n_\nkara\'s sense, and rather seem to favour the opinion, held among others by\nRamanu _g_ a, that the soul is of minute size. We have further seen that Sutra\n18 of the third pada of the second adhyaya, which describes the soul as \' _g\n\xc3\xb1_a,\' is more appropriately understood in the sense assigned to it by Ramanu\n_g_ a; and, again, that the Sutras which treat of the soul being an agent, can\nbe reconciled with _S_ a _n_ kara\'s views only if supplemented in a way which\ntheir text does not appear to authorise.--We next have the important Sutra II,\n3, 43 in which the soul is distinctly said to be a part (a _ms_ a) of Brahman,\nand which, as we have already noticed, can be made to fall in with _S_ a _n_\nkara\'s views only if a _ms_ a is explained, altogether arbitrarily, by \'a _ms_\na iva,\' while Ramanu _g_ a is able to take the Sutra as it stands.--We also\nhave already referred to Sutra 50, \'abhasa eva _k_ a,\' which _S_ a _n_ kara\ninterprets as setting forth the so-called pratibimbavada according to which\nthe individual Self is merely a reflection of the highest Self. But almost\nevery Sutra--and Sutra 50 forms no exception-being so obscurely expressed,\nthat viewed by itself it admits of various, often totally opposed,\ninterpretations, the only safe method is to keep in view, in the case of each\nambiguous\n\np. xcviii\n\naphorism, the general drift and spirit of the whole work, and that, as we have\nseen hitherto, is by no means favourable to the pratibimba doctrine. How\nindeed could Sutra 50, if setting forth that latter doctrine, be reconciled\nwith Sutra 43, which says distinctly that the soul is a part of Brahman? For\nthat 43 contains, as _S_ a _n_ kara and his commentators aver, a statement of\nthe ava _kkh_ edavada, can itself be accepted only if we interpret a _ms_ a by\na _ms_ a iva, and to do so there is really no valid reason whatever. I confess\nthat Ramanu _g_ a\'s interpretation of the Sutra (which however is accepted by\nseveral other commentators also) does not appear to me particularly\nconvincing; and the Sutras unfortunately offer us no other passages on the\nground of which we might settle the meaning to be ascribed to the term abhasa,\nwhich may mean \'reflection,\' but may mean hetvabhasa, i. e. fallacious\nargument, as well. But as things stand, this one Sutra cannot, at any rate, be\nappealed to as proving that the pratibimbavada which, in its turn, presupposes\nthe mayavada, is the teaching of the Sutras.\n\nTo the conclusion that the Sutrakara did not hold the doctrine of the absolute\nidentity of the highest and the individual soul in the sense of _S_ a _n_\nkara, we are further led by some other indications to be met with here and\nthere in the Sutras. In the conspectus of contents we have had occasion to\ndirect attention to the important Sutra II, 1, 22, which distinctly enunciates\nthat the Lord is adhika, i. e. additional to, or different from, the\nindividual soul, since Scripture declares the two to be different. Analogously\nI, 2, 20 lays stress on the fact that the _s_ arira is not the antaryamin,\nbecause the Madhyandinas, as well as the Ka _n_ vas, speak of him in their\ntexts as different (bhedena enam adhiyate), and in 22 the _s_ arira and the\npradhana are referred to as the two \'others\' (itarau) of whom the text\npredicates distinctive attributes separating them from the highest Lord. The\nword \'itara\' (the other one) appears in several other passages (I, 1, 16; I,\n3, 16; II, 1, 21) as a kind of technical term denoting the individual soul in\ncontradistinction from the Lord. The _S_ a _n_ karas indeed maintain that all\nthose passages refer to an unreal distinction\n\np. xciv\n\ndue to avidya. But this is just what we should like to see proved, and the\nproof offered in no case amounts to more than a reference to the system which\ndemands that the Sutras should be thus understood. If we accept the\ninterpretations of the school of _S_ a _n_ kara, it remains altogether\nunintelligible why the Sutrakara should never hint even at what _S_ a _n_ kara\nis anxious again and again to point out at length, viz. that the greater part\nof the work contains a kind of exoteric doctrine only, ever tending to mislead\nthe student who does not keep in view what its nature is. If other reasons\nshould make it probable that the Sutrakara was anxious to hide the true\ndoctrine of the Upanishads as a sort of esoteric teaching, we might be more\nready to accept _S_ a _n_ kara\'s mode of interpretation. But no such reasons\nare forthcoming; nowhere among the avowed followers of the _S_ a _n_ kara\nsystem is there any tendency to treat the kernel of their philosophy as\nsomething to be jealously guarded and hidden. On the contrary, they all, from\nGau _d_ apada down to the most modern writer, consider it their most\nimportant, nay, only task to inculcate again and again in the clearest and\nmost unambiguous language that all appearance of multiplicity is a vain\nillusion, that the Lord and the individual souls are in reality one, and that\nall knowledge but this one knowledge is without true value.\n\nThere remains one more important passage concerning the relation of the\nindividual soul to the highest Self, a passage which attracted our attention\nabove, when we were reviewing the evidence for early divergence of opinion\namong the teachers of the Vedanta. I mean I, 4, 20-22, which three Sutras\nstate the views of \xc3\x82 _s_ marathya, Au _d_ ulomi, and Ka _s_ akr _ri_ tsna as\nto the reason why, in a certain passage of the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka,\ncharacteristics of the individual soul are ascribed to the highest Self. The\nsiddhanta view is enounced in Sutra 22, \'avasthiter iti Ka _s_ ak _ri_ tsna\n_h_ \' i. e. Ka _s_ ak _ri_ tsna (accounts for the circumstance mentioned) on\nthe ground of the \'permanent abiding or abode.\' By this \'permanent abiding\'\n_S_ a _n_ kara understands the Lord\'s abiding as, i. e. existing as--or in the\ncondition of--the individual soul, and thus sees in the Sutra an enunciation\n\np. c\n\nof his own view that the individual soul is nothing but the highest Self,\n\'avik _ri_ ta _h_ parame _s_ varo _g_ ivo nanya _h_.\' Ramanu _g_ a on the\nother hand, likewise accepting Ka _s_ ak _ri_ tsna\'s opinion as the siddhanta\nview, explains \'avasthiti\' as the Lord\'s permanent abiding within the\nindividual soul, as described in the antaryamin-brahma _n_ a.--We can hardly\nmaintain that the term \'avasthiti\' cannot have the meaning ascribed to it by\n_S_ a _n_ kara, viz. special state or condition, but so much must be urged in\nfavour of Ramanu _g_ a\'s interpretation that in the five other places where\navasthiti (or anavasthiti) is met with in the Sutras (I, 2, 17; II, 2, 4; II,\n2, 13; II, 3, 24; III, 3, 32) it regularly means permanent abiding or\npermanent abode within something.\n\nIf, now, I am shortly to sum up the results of the preceding enquiry as to the\nteaching of the Sutras, I must, give it as my opinion that they do not set\nforth the distinction of a higher and lower knowledge of Brahman; that they do\nnot acknowledge the distinction of Brahman and \xc3\x8e _s_ vara in _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\nsense; that they do not hold the doctrine of the unreality of the world; and\nthat they do not, with _S_ a _n_ kara, proclaim the absolute identity of the\nindividual and the highest Self. I do not wish to advance for the present\nbeyond these negative results. Upon Ramanu _g_ a\'s mode of interpretation--\nalthough I accept it without reserve in some important details--I look on the\nwhole as more useful in providing us with a powerful means of criticising _S_\na _n_ kara\'s explanations than in guiding us throughout to the right\nunderstanding of the text. The author of the Sutras may have held views about\nthe nature of Brahman, the world, and the soul differing from those of _S_ a\n_n_ kara, and yet not agreeing in all points with those of Ramanu _g_ a. If,\nhowever, the negative conclusions stated above should be well founded, it\nwould follow even from them that the system of Badaraya _n_ a had greater\naffinities with that of the Bhagavatas and Ramanu _g_ a than with the one of\nwhich the _S_ a _n_ kara-bhashya is the classical exponent.\n\nIt appears from the above review of the teaching of the Sutras that only a\ncomparatively very small proportion of them contribute matter enabling us to\nform a judgment\n\np. ci\n\nas to the nature of the philosophical doctrine advocated by Badaraya _n_ a.\nThe reason of this is that the greater part of the work is taken up with\nmatters which, according to _S_ a _n_ kara\'s terminology, form part of the so-\ncalled lower knowledge, and throw no light upon philosophical questions in the\nstricter sense of the word. This circumstance is not without significance. In\nlater works belonging to _S_ a _n_ kara\'s school in which the distinction of a\nhigher and lower vidya is clearly recognised, the topics constituting the\nlatter are treated with great shortness; and rightly so, for they are unable\nto accomplish the highest aim of man, i.e. final release. When we therefore,\non the other hand, find that the subjects of the so-called lower vidya are\ntreated very fully in the Vedanta-sutras, when we observe, for instance, the\nalmost tedious length to which the investigation of the unity of vidyas (most\nof which are so-called sagu _n_ a, i.e. lower vidyas) is carried in the third\nadhyaya, or the fact of almost the whole fourth adhyaya being devoted to the\nultimate fate of the possessor of the lower vidya; we certainly feel ourselves\nconfirmed in our conclusion that what _S_ a _n_ kara looked upon as\ncomparatively unimportant formed in Badaraya _n_ a\'s opinion part of that\nknowledge higher than which there is none, and which therefore is entitled to\nthe fullest and most detailed exposition.\n\nThe question as to what kind of system is represented by the Vedanta-sutras\nmay be approached in another way also. While hitherto we have attempted to\npenetrate to the meaning of the Sutras by means of the different commentaries,\nwe might try the opposite road, and, in the first place, attempt to ascertain\nindependently of the Sutras what doctrine is set forth in the Upanishads,\nwhose teaching the Sutras doubtless aim at systematising. If, it might be\nurged, the Upanishads can be convincingly shown to embody a certain settled\ndoctrine, we must consider it at the least highly probable that that very same\ndoctrine--of whatever special nature it may be--is hidden in the enigmatical\naphorisms of Badaraya _n_ a 1.\n\nI do not, however, consider this line of argumentation\n\np. cii\n\na safe one. Even if it could be shown that the teaching of all the chief\nUpanishads agrees in all essential points (a subject to which some attention\nwill be paid later on), we should not on that account be entitled\nunhesitatingly to assume that the Sutras set forth the same doctrine. Whatever\nthe true philosophy of the Upanishads may be, there remains the undeniable\nfact that there exist and have existed since very ancient times not one but\nseveral essentially differing systems, all of which lay claim to the\ndistinction of being the true representatives of the teaching of the\nUpanishads as well as of the Sutras. Let us suppose, for argument\'s sake,\nthat, for instance, the doctrine of Maya is distinctly enunciated in the\nUpanishads; nevertheless Ramanu _g_ a and, for all we know to the contrary,\nthe whole series of more ancient commentators on whom he looked as authorities\nin the interpretation of the Sutras, denied that the Upanishads teach Maya,\nand it is hence by no means impossible that Badaraya _n_ a should have done\nthe same. The a priori style of reasoning as to the teaching of the Sutras is\ntherefore without much force.\n\nBut apart from any intention of arriving thereby at the meaning of the Sutras\nthere, of course, remains for us the all-important question as to the true\nteaching of the Upanishads, a question which a translator of the Sutras and\n_S_ a _n_ kara cannot afford to pass over in silence, especially after reason\nhas been shown for the conclusion that the Sutras and the _S_ a _n_ kara-\nbhashya do not agree concerning most important points of Vedantic doctrine.\nThe Sutras as well as the later commentaries claim, in the first place, to be\nnothing more than systematisations of the Upanishads, and for us a\nconsiderable part at least of their value and interest lies in this their\nnature. Hence the further question presents itself by whom the teaching of the\nUpanishads has been most adequately systematised, whether by Badaraya _n_ a,\nor _S_ a _n_ kara, or Ramanu _g_ a, or some other commentator. This question\nrequires to be kept altogether separate from the enquiry as to which\ncommentator most faithfully renders the contents of the Sutras, and it is by\nno means impossible that _S_ a _n_ kara, for instance, should in\n\np. ciii\n\nthe end have to be declared a more trustworthy guide with regard to the\nteaching of the Upanishads than concerning the meaning of the Sutras.\n\nWe must remark here at once that, whatever commentator may be found to deserve\npreference on the whole, it appears fairly certain already at the outset that\nnone of the systems which Indian ingenuity has succeeded in erecting on the\nbasis of the Upanishads can be accepted in its entirety. The reason for this\nlies in the nature of the Upanishads themselves. To the Hindu commentator and\nphilosopher the Upanishads came down as a body of revealed truth whose\nteaching had, somehow or other, to be shown to be thoroughly consistent and\nfree from contradictions; a system had to be devised in which a suitable place\ncould be allotted to every one of the multitudinous statements which they make\non the various points of Vedantic doctrine. But to the European scholar, or in\nfact to any one whose mind is not bound by the doctrine of _S_ ruti, it will\ncertainly appear that all such attempts stand self-condemned. If anything is\nevident even on a cursory review of the Upanishads--and the impression so\ncreated is only strengthened by a more careful investigation--it is that they\ndo not constitute a systematic whole. They themselves, especially the older\nones, give the most unmistakable indications on that point. Not only are the\ndoctrines expounded in the different Upanishads ascribed to different\nteachers, but even the separate sections of one and the same Upanishad are\nassigned to different authorities. It would be superfluous to quote examples\nof what a mere look at the _Kh_ andogya Upanishad, for instance, suffices to\nprove. It is of course not impossible that even a multitude of teachers should\nagree in imparting precisely the same doctrine; but in the case of the\nUpanishads that is certainly not antecedently probable. For, in the first\nplace, the teachers who are credited with the doctrines of the Upanishads\nmanifestly belonged to different sections of Brahminical society, to different\nVedic _s_ akhas; nay, some of them the tradition makes out to have been\nkshattriyas. And, in the second place, the period, whose\n\np. civ\n\nmental activity is represented in the Upanishads, was a creative one, and as\nsuch cannot be judged according to the analogy of later periods of Indian\nphilosophic development. The later philosophic schools as, for instance, the\none of which _S_ a _n_ kara is the great representative, were no longer free\nin their speculations, but strictly bound by a traditional body of texts\nconsidered sacred, which could not be changed or added to, but merely\nsystematised and commented upon. Hence the rigorous uniformity of doctrine\ncharacteristic of those schools. But there had been a time when, what later\nwriters received as a sacred legacy, determining and confining the whole\ncourse of their speculations, first sprang from the minds of creative thinkers\nnot fettered by the tradition of any school, but freely following the\npromptings of their own heads and hearts. By the absence of school traditions,\nI do not indeed mean that the great teachers who appear in the Upanishads were\nfree to make an entirely new start, and to assign to their speculations any\ndirection they chose; for nothing can be more certain than that, at the period\nas the outcome of whose philosophical activity the Upanishads have to be\nconsidered, there were in circulation certain broad speculative ideas\novershadowing the mind of every member of Brahminical society. But those ideas\nwere neither very definite nor worked out in detail, and hence allowed\nthemselves to be handled and fashioned in different ways by different\nindividuals. With whom the few leading conceptions traceable in the teaching\nof all Upanishads first originated, is a point on which those writings\nthemselves do not enlighten us, and which we have no other means for settling;\nmost probably they are to be viewed not as the creation of any individual\nmind, but as the gradual outcome of speculations carried on by generations of\nVedic theologians. In the Upanishads themselves, at any rate, they appear as\nfloating mental possessions which may be seized and moulded into new forms by\nany one who feels within himself the required inspiration. A certain vague\nknowledge of Brahman, the great hidden being in which all this manifold world\nis one, seems to be\n\np. cv\n\nspread everywhere, and often issues from the most unexpected sources. _S_\nvetaketu receives instruction from his father Uddalaka; the proud Gargya has\nto become the pupil of A _g_ ata _s_ atru, the king of Ka _s_ i; Bhu _g_ yu\nSahyayani receives answers to his questions from a Gandharva possessing a\nmaiden; Satyakama learns what Brahman is from the bull of the herd he is\ntending, from Agni and from a flamingo; and Upako _s_ ala is taught by the\nsacred fires in his teacher\'s house. All this is of course legend, not\nhistory; but the fact that the philosophic and theological doctrines of the\nUpanishads are clothed in this legendary garb certainly does not strengthen\nthe expectation of finding in them a rigidly systematic doctrine.\n\nAnd a closer investigation of the contents of the Upanishads amply confirms\nthis preliminary impression. If we avail ourselves, for instance, of M. Paul\nRegnaud\'s Materiaux pour servir a l\'Histoire de la Philosophie de l\'Inde, in\nwhich the philosophical lucubrations of the different Upanishads are arranged\nsystematically according to topics, we can see with ease how, together with a\ncertain uniformity of general leading conceptions, there runs throughout\ndivergence in details, and very often not unimportant details. A look, for\ninstance, at the collection of passages relative to the origination of the\nworld from the primitive being, suffices to show that the task of\ndemonstrating that whatever the Upanishads teach on that point can be made to\nfit into a homogeneous system is an altogether hopeless one. The accounts\nthere given of the creation belong, beyond all doubt to different stages of\nphilosophic and theological development or else to different sections of\npriestly society. None but an Indian commentator would, I suppose, be inclined\nand sufficiently courageous to attempt the proof that, for instance, the\nlegend of the atman purushavidha, the Self in the shape of a person which is\nas large as man and woman together, and then splits itself into two halves\nfrom which cows, horses, asses, goats, &c. are produced in succession (B _ri_.\nUp. I, 1, 4), can be reconciled with the account given of the creation in the\n_Kh_ andogya Upanishad, where it is said that in the beginning there existed\nnothing but the sat,\n\np. cvi\n\n\'that which is,\' and that feeling a desire of being many it emitted out of\nitself ether, and then all the other elements in due succession. The former is\na primitive cosmogonic myth, which in its details shows striking analogies\nwith the cosmogonic myths of other nations; the latter account is fairly\ndeveloped Vedanta (although not Vedanta implying the Maya doctrine). We may\nadmit that both accounts show a certain fundamental similarity in so far as\nthey derive the manifold world from one original being; but to go beyond this\nand to maintain, as _S_ a _n_ kara does, that the atman purushavidha of the B\n_ri_ hadara _n_ yaka is the so-called Vira _g_ of the latter Vedanta--implying\nthereby that that section consciously aims at describing only the activity of\none special form of \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, and not simply the whole process of creation--\nis the ingenious shift of an orthodox commentator in difficulties, but nothing\nmore.\n\nHow all those more or less conflicting texts came to be preserved and handed\ndown to posterity, is not difficult to understand. As mentioned above, each of\nthe great sections of Brahminical priesthood had its own sacred texts, and\nagain in each of those sections there existed more ancient texts which it was\nimpossible to discard when deeper and more advanced speculations began in\ntheir turn to be embodied in literary compositions, which in the course of\ntime likewise came to be looked upon as sacred. When the creative period had\nreached its termination, and the task of collecting and arranging was taken in\nhand, older and newer pieces were combined into wholes, and thus there arose\ncollections of such heterogeneous character as the _Kh_ andogya and B _ri_\nhadara _n_ yaka Upanishads. On later generations, to which the whole body of\ntexts came down as revealed truth, there consequently devolved the inevitable\ntask of establishing systems on which no exception could be taken to any of\nthe texts; but that the task was, strictly speaking, an impossible one, i.e.\none which it was impossible to accomplish fairly and honestly, there really is\nno reason to deny.\n\nFor a comprehensive criticism of the methods which the different commentators\nemploy in systematizing the contents\n\np. cvii\n\nof the Upanishads there is no room in this place. In order, however, to\nillustrate what is meant by the \'impossibility,\' above alluded to, of\ncombining the various doctrines of the Upanishads into a whole without doing\nviolence to a certain number of texts, it will be as well to analyse in detail\nsome few at least of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s interpretations, and to render clear the\nconsiderations by which he is guided.\n\nWe begin with a case which has already engaged our attention when discussing\nthe meaning of the Sutras, viz. the question concerning the ultimate fate of\nthose who have attained the knowledge of Brahman. As we have seen, _S_ a _n_\nkara teaches that the soul of him who has risen to an insight into the nature\nof the higher Brahman does not, at the moment of death, pass out of the body,\nbut is directly merged in Brahman by a process from which all departing and\nmoving, in fact all considerations of space, are altogether excluded. The soul\nof him, on the other hand, who has not risen above the knowledge of the lower\nqualified Brahman departs from the body by means of the artery called sushum\n_n_ a, and following the so-called devayana, the path of the gods, mounts up\nto the world of Brahman. A review of the chief Upanishad texts on which _S_ a\n_n_ kara founds this distinction will show how far it is justified.\n\nIn a considerable number of passages the Upanishads contrast the fate of two\nclasses of men, viz. of those who perform sacrifices and meritorious works\nonly, and of those who in addition possess a certain kind of knowledge. Men of\nthe former kind ascend after death to the moon, where they live for a certain\ntime, and then return to the earth into new forms of embodiment; persons of\nthe latter kind proceed on the path of the gods--on which the sun forms one\nstage--up to the world of Brahman, from which there is no return. The chief\npassages to that effect are _Kh_. Up. V, 10; Kaush. Up. I, 2 ff.; Mu _nd_. Up.\nI, 2, 9 ff.; B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 15 ff.; Pra _s_ na Up. I, 9 ff.--In other\npassages only the latter of the two paths is referred to, cp. _Kh_. Up. IV,\n15; VIII 6, 5; Taitt. Up. I, 6; B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 8, 9; V, 10; Maitr. Up. VI,\n30, to mention only the more important ones.\n\nNow an impartial consideration of those passages shows\n\np. cviii\n\n[paragraph continues] I think, beyond any doubt, that what is meant there by\nthe knowledge which leads through the sun to the world of Brahman is the\nhighest knowledge of which the devotee is capable, and that the world of\nBrahman to which his knowledge enables him to proceed denotes the highest\nstate which he can ever reach, the state of final release, if we choose to\ncall it by that name.-- _Kh_. Up. V, 10 says, \'Those who know this (viz. the\ndoctrine of the five fires), and those who in the forest follow faith and\nausterities go to light,\' &c.-- _Kh_. Up. IV, 15 is manifestly intended to\nconvey the true knowledge of Brahman; Upako _s_ ala\'s teacher himself\nrepresents the instruction given by him as superior to the teaching of the\nsacred fires.-- _Kh_. Up. VIII, 6, 5 quotes the old _s_ loka which says that\nthe man moving upwards by the artery penetrating the crown of the head reaches\nthe Immortal.--Kaush. Up. I, 2--which gives the most detailed account of the\nascent of the soul--contains no intimation whatever of the knowledge of\nBrahman, which leads up to the Brahman world, being of an inferior nature.--Mu\n_nd_. Up. I, 2, 9 agrees with the _Kh_ andogya in saying that \'Those who\npractise penance and faith in the forest, tranquil, wise, and living on alms,\ndepart free from passion, through the sun, to where that immortal Person\ndwells whose nature is imperishable,\' and nothing whatever in the context\ncountenances the assumption that not the highest knowledge and the highest\nPerson are there referred to.--B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 8 quotes old _s_ lokas\nclearly referring to the road of the gods (\'the small old path\'), on which\n\'sages who know Brahman move on to the svargaloka and thence higher on as\nentirely free.--That path was found by Brahman, and on it goes whoever knows\nBrahman.\'--B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 15 is another version of the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_agnividya,\nwith the variation, \'Those who know this, and those who in the forest worship\nfaith and the True, go to light,\' &c.--Pra _s_ na Up. 1, 10 says, \'Those who\nhave sought the Self by penance, abstinence, faith, and knowledge gain by the\nnorthern path \xc3\x82ditya, the sun. There is the home of the spirits, the immortal\nfree from danger, the highest. From thence they do not return, for it is the\nend.\'--Maitr. Up. VI, 30 quotes\n\np. cix\n\n_\n\ns_lokas, \'One of them (the arteries) leads upwards, piercing the solar orb: by\nit, having stepped beyond the world of Brahman, they go to the highest path.\'\n\nAll these passages are as clear as can be desired. The soul of the sage who\nknows Brahman passes out by the sushum _n_ a, and ascends by the path of the\ngods to the world of Brahman, there to remain for ever in some blissful state.\nBut, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, all these texts are meant to set forth the\nresult of a certain inferior knowledge only, of the knowledge of the\nconditioned Brahman. Even in a passage apparently so entirely incapable of\nmore than one interpretation as B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 15, the \'True,\' which the\nholy hermits in the forest are said to worship, is not to be the highest\nBrahman, but only Hira _n_ yagarbha!--And why?--Only because the system so\ndemands it, the system which teaches that those who know the highest Brahman\nbecome on their death one with it, without having to resort to any other\nplace. The passage on which this latter tenet is chiefly based is B _ri_. Up.\nIV, 4, 6, 7, where, with the fate of him who at his death has desires, and\nwhose soul therefore enters a new body after having departed from the old one,\naccompanied by all the pra _n_ as, there is contrasted the fate of the sage\nfree from all desires. \'But as to the man who does not desire, who not\ndesiring, freed from desires is satisfied in his desires, or desires the Self\nonly, the vital spirits of him (tasya) do not depart--being Brahman he goes to\nBrahman.\'\n\nWe have seen above (p. lxxx) that this passage is referred to in the important\nSutras on whose right interpretation it, in the first place, depends whether\nor not we must admit the Sutrakara to have acknowledged the distinction of a\npara and an apara vidya. Here the passage interests us as throwing light on\nthe way in which _S_ a _n_ kara systematises. He looks on the preceding part\nof the chapter as describing what happens to the souls of all those who do not\nknow the highest Brahman, inclusive of those who know the lower Brahman only.\nThey pass out of the old bodies followed by all pra _n_ as and enter new\nbodies. He, on the other hand, section 6 continues, who knows the true\nBrahman, does not pass out of the body, but becomes one with Brahman then\n\np. cx\n\nand there. This interpretation of the purport of the entire chapter is not\nimpossibly right, although I am rather inclined to think that the chapter aims\nat setting forth in its earlier part the future of him who does not know\nBrahman at all, while the latter part of section 6 passes on to him who does\nknow Brahman (i.e. Brahman pure and simple, the text knowing of no distinction\nof the so-called lower and higher Brahman). In explaining section 6 _S_ a _n_\nkara lays stress upon the clause \'na tasya pra _n_ a utkramanti,\' \'his vital\nspirits do not pass out,\' taking this to signify that the soul with the vital\nspirits does not move at all, and thus does not ascend to the world of\nBrahman; while the purport of the clause may simply be that the soul and vital\nspirits do not go anywhere else, i.e. do not enter a new body, but are united,\nsomehow or other, with Brahman. On _S_ a _n_ kara\'s interpretation there\nimmediately arises a new difficulty. In the _s_ lokas, quoted under sections 8\nand 9, the description of the small old path which leads to the svargaloka and\nhigher on clearly refers--as noticed already above--to the path through the\nveins, primarily the sushum _n_ a, on which, according to so many other\npassages, the soul of the wise mounts upwards. But that path is, according to\n_S_ a _n_ kara, followed by him only who has not risen above the lower\nknowledge, and yet the _s_ lokas have manifestly to be connected with what is\nsaid in the latter half of 6 about the owner of the para vidya. Hence _S_ a\n_n_ kara sees himself driven to explain the _s_ lokas in 8 and 9 (of which a\nfaithful translation is given in Professor Max Muller\'s version) as follows:\n\n8\\. \'The subtle old path (i.e. the path of knowledge on which final release is\nreached; which path is subtle, i.e. difficult to know, and old, i.e. to be\nknown from the eternal Veda) has been obtained and fully reached by me. On it\nthe sages who know Brahman reach final release (svargaloka _s_ abda _h_\nsamnihitaprakara _n_ at mokshabhidhayaka _h_ ).\n\n9\\. \'On that path they say that there is white or blue or yellow or green or\nred (i.e. others maintain that the path to final release is, in accordance\nwith the colour of the arteries, either white or blue, &c.; but that is false,\nfor the\n\np. cxi\n\npaths through the arteries lead at the best to the world of Brahman, which\nitself forms part of the sa _m_ sara); that path (i. e. the only path to\nrelease, viz. the path of true knowledge) is found by Brahman, i. e. by such\nBrahma _n_ as as through true knowledge have become like Brahman,\' &c.\n\nA significant instance in truth of the straits to which thorough-going\nsystematisers of the Upanishads see themselves reduced occasionally!\n\nBut we return to the point which just now chiefly interests us. Whether _S_ a\n_n_ kara\'s interpretation of the chapter, and especially of section 6, be\nright or wrong, so much is certain that we are not entitled to view all those\ntexts which speak of the soul going to the world of Brahman as belonging to\nthe so-called lower knowledge, because a few other passages declare that the\nsage does not go to Brahman. The text which declares the sage free from\ndesires to become one with Brahman could not, without due discrimination, be\nused to define and limit the meaning of other passages met with in the same\nUpanishad even--for as we have remarked above the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka\ncontains pieces manifestly belonging to different stages of development;--much\nless does it entitle us to put arbitrary constructions on passages forming\npart of other Upanishads. Historically the disagreement of the various\naccounts is easy to understand. The older notion was that the soul of the wise\nman proceeds along the path of the gods to Brahman\'s abode. A later--and, if\nwe like, more philosophic--conception is that, as Brahman already is a man\'s\nSelf, there is no need of any motion on man\'s part to reach Brahman. We may\neven apply to those two views the terms apara and para\\--lower and higher--\nknowledge. But we must not allow any commentator to induce us to believe that\nwhat he from his advanced standpoint looks upon as an inferior kind of\ncognition, was viewed in the same light by the authors of the Upanishads.\n\nWe turn to another Upanishad text likewise touching upon the point considered\nin what precedes, viz. the second Brahma _n_ a of the third adhyaya of the B\n_ri_ hadara _n_ yaka. The discussion there first turns upon the grahas and\natigrahas,\n\np. cxii\n\ni. e. the senses and organs and their objects, and Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya thereupon\nexplains that death, by which everything is overcome, is itself overcome by\nwater; for death is fire. The colloquy then turns to what we must consider an\naltogether new topic, \xc3\x82rtabhaga asking, \'When this man (ayam purusha) dies, do\nthe vital spirits depart from him or not?\' and Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya answering, \'No,\nthey are gathered up in him; he swells, he is inflated; inflated the dead\n(body) is lying.\'--Now this is for _S_ a _n_ kara an important passage, as we\nhave already seen above (p. lxxxi); for he employs it, in his comment on\nVed.-sutra IV, 2, 13, for the purpose of proving that the passage B _ri_. Up.\nIV, 4, 6 really means that the vital spirits do not, at the moment of death,\ndepart from the true sage. Hence the present passage also must refer to him\nwho possesses the highest knowledge; hence the \'ayam purusha\' must be \'that\nman,\' i. e. the man who possesses the highest knowledge, and the highest\nknowledge then must be found in the preceding clause which says that death\nitself may be conquered by water. But, as Ramanu _g_ a also remarks, neither\ndoes the context favour the assumption that the highest knowledge is referred\nto, nor do the words of section 11 contain any indication that what is meant\nis the merging of the Self of the true Sage in Brahman. With the\ninterpretation given by Ramanu _g_ a himself, viz. that the pra _n_ as do not\ndepart from the _g_ iva of the dying man, but accompany it into a new body, I\ncan agree as little (although he no doubt rightly explains the \'ayam purusha\'\nby \'man\' in general), and am unable to see in the passage anything more than a\ncrude attempt to account for the fact that a dead body appears swollen and\ninflated.--A little further on (section 13) \xc3\x82rtabhaga asks what becomes of\nthis man (ayam purusha) when his speech has entered into the fire, his breath\ninto the air, his eye into the sun, &c. So much here is clear that we have no\nright to understand by the \'ayam purusha\' of section 13 anybody different from\nthe \'ayam purusha\' of the two preceding sections; in spite of this _S_ a _n_\nkara--according to whose system the organs of the true sage do not enter into\nthe elements, but are directly\n\np. cxiii\n\nmerged in Brahman--explains the \'ayam purusha\' of section 13 to be the \'asa\n_m_ yagdar _s_ in,\' i.e. the person who has not risen to the cognition of the\nhighest Brahman. And still a further limiting interpretation is required by\nthe system. The asa _m_ yagdar _s_ in also who as such has to remain in the sa\n_m_ sara-cannot do without the organs, since his _g_ iva when passing out of\nthe old body into a new one is invested with the subtle body; hence section 13\ncannot be taken as saying what it clearly does say, viz. that at death the\ndifferent organs pass into the different elements, but as merely indicating\nthat the organs are abandoned by the divinities which, during lifetime,\npresided over them!\n\nThe whole third adhyaya indeed of the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka affords ample\nproof of the artificial character of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s attempts to show that\nthe teaching of the Upanishads follows a definite system. The eighth brahma\n_n_ a, for instance, is said to convey the doctrine of the highest non-related\nBrahman, while the preceding brahma _n_ as had treated only of \xc3\x8e _s_ vara in\nhis various aspects. But, as a matter of fact, brahma _n_ a 8, after having,\nin section 8, represented Brahman as destitute of all qualities, proceeds, in\nthe next section, to describe that very same Brahman as the ruler of the\nworld, \'By the command of that Imperishable sun and moon stand apart,\' &c.; a\nclear indication that the author of the Upanishad does not distinguish a\nhigher and lower Brahman in-- _S_ a _n_ kara\'s sense.--The preceding brahma\n_n_ a (7) treats of the antaryamin, i.e. Brahman viewed as the internal ruler\nof everything. This, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, is the lower form of Brahman\ncalled \xc3\x8e _s_ vara; but we observe that the antaryamin as well as the so-called\nhighest Brahman described in section 8 is, at the termination of the two\nsections, characterised by means of the very same terms (7, 23: Unseen but\nseeing, unheard but hearing, &c. There is no other seer but he, there is no\nother hearer but he, &c.; and 8, 11: That Brahman is unseen but seeing,\nunheard but hearing, &c. There is nothing that sees but it, nothing that hears\nbut it, &c.).--Nothing can be clearer than that all these sections aim at\ndescribing one and the same being, and know nothing of the distinctions made\nby the developed\n\np. cxiv\n\n[paragraph continues] Vedanta, however valid the latter may be from a purely\nphilosophic point of view.\n\nWe may refer to one more similar instance from the _Kh_ andogya Upanishad. We\nthere meet in III, 14 with one of the most famous vidyas describing the nature\nof Brahman, called after its reputed author the Sa _nd_ ilya-vidya. This small\nvidya is decidedly one of the finest and most characteristic texts; it would\nbe difficult to point out another passage setting forth with greater force and\neloquence and in an equally short compass the central doctrine of the\nUpanishads. Yet this text, which, beyond doubt, gives utterance to the highest\nconception of Brahman\'s nature that Sa _nd_ ilya\'s thought was able to reach,\nis by _S_ a _n_ kara and his school again declared to form part of the lower\nvidya only, because it represents Brahman as possessing qualities. It is,\naccording to their terminology, not _g \xc3\xb1_ana, i. e. knowledge, but the\ninjunction of a mere upasana, a devout meditation on Brahman in so far as\npossessing certain definite attributes such as having light for its form,\nhaving true thoughts, and so on. The Ramanu _g_ as, on the other hand, quote\nthis text with preference as clearly describing the nature of their highest,\ni. e. their one Brahman. We again allow that _S_ a _n_ kara is free to deny\nthat any text which ascribes qualities to Brahman embodies absolute truth; but\nwe also again remark that there is no reason whatever for supposing that Sa\n_nd_ ilya, or whoever may have been the author of that vidya, looked upon it\nas anything else but a statement of the highest truth accessible to man.\n\nWe return to the question as to the true philosophy of the Upanishads, apart\nfrom the systems of the commentators.--From what precedes it will appear with\nsufficient distinctness that, if we understand by philosophy a philosophical\nsystem coherent in all its parts, free from all contradictions and allowing\nroom for all the different statements made in all the chief Upanishads, a\nphilosophy of the Upanishads cannot even be spoken of. The various\nlucubrations on Brahman, the world, and the human soul of which the Upanishads\nconsist do not allow themselves to be systematised simply because they were\nnever meant to\n\np. cxv\n\nform a system. _S_ a _nd_ ilya\'s views as to the nature of Brahman did not in\nall details agree with those of Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya, and Uddalaka differed from\nboth. In this there is nothing to wonder at, and the burden of proof rests\naltogether with those who maintain that a large number of detached philosophic\nand theological dissertations, ascribed to different authors, doubtless\nbelonging to different periods, and not seldom manifestly contradicting each\nother, admit of being combined into a perfectly consistent whole.\n\nThe question, however, assumes a different aspect, if we take the terms\n\'philosophy\' and \'philosophical system,\' not in the strict sense in which _S_\na _n_ kara and other commentators are not afraid of taking them, but as\nimplying merely an agreement in certain fundamental features. In this latter\nsense we may indeed undertake to indicate the outlines of a philosophy of the\nUpanishads, only keeping in view that precision in details is not to be aimed\nat. And here we finally see ourselves driven back altogether on the texts\nthemselves, and have to acknowledge that the help we receive from\ncommentators, to whatever school they may belong, is very inconsiderable.\nFortunately it cannot be asserted that the texts on the whole oppose very\nserious difficulties to a right understanding, however obscure the details\noften are. Concerning the latter we occasionally depend entirely on the\nexplanations vouchsafed by the scholiasts, but as far as the general drift and\nspirit of the texts are concerned, we are quite able to judge by ourselves,\nand are even specially qualified to do so by having no particular system to\nadvocate.\n\nThe point we will first touch upon is the same from which we started when\nexamining the doctrine of the Sutras, viz. the question whether the Upanishads\nacknowledge a higher and lower knowledge in _S_ a _n_ kara\'s sense, i. e. a\nknowledge of a higher and a lower Brahman. Now this we find not to be the\ncase. Knowledge is in the Upanishads frequently opposed to avidya, by which\nlatter term we have to understand ignorance as to Brahman, absence of\nphilosophic knowledge; and, again, in several places we find the knowledge of\nthe sacrificial part of the Veda with its supplementary\n\np. cxvi\n\ndisciplines contrasted as inferior with the knowledge of the Self; to which\nlatter distinction the Mu _nd_ aka Up. (I, 4) applies the terms apara and para\nvidya. But a formal recognition of the essential difference of Brahman being\nviewed, on the one hand, as possessing distinctive attributes, and, on the\nother hand, as devoid of all such attributes is not to be met with anywhere.\nBrahman is indeed sometimes described as sagu _n_ a and sometimes as nirgu _n_\na (to use later terms); but it is nowhere said that thereon rests a\ndistinction of two different kinds of knowledge leading to altogether\ndifferent results. The knowledge of Brahman is one, under whatever aspects it\nis viewed; hence the circumstance (already exemplified above) that in the same\nvidyas it is spoken of as sagu _n_ a as well as nirgu _n_ a. When the mind of\nthe writer dwells on the fact that Brahman is that from which all this world\noriginates, and in which it rests, he naturally applies to it distinctive\nattributes pointing at its relation to the world; Brahman, then, is called the\nSelf and life of all, the inward ruler, the omniscient Lord, and so on. When,\non the other hand, the author follows out the idea that Brahman may be viewed\nin itself as the mysterious reality of which the whole expanse of the world is\nonly an outward manifestation, then it strikes him that no idea or term\nderived from sensible experience can rightly be applied to it, that nothing\nmore may be predicated of it but that it is neither this nor that. But these\nare only two aspects of the cognition of one and the same entity.\n\nClosely connected with the question as to the double nature of the Brahman of\nthe Upanishads is the question as to their teaching Maya.--From Colebrooke\ndownwards the majority of European writers have inclined towards the opinion\nthat the doctrine of Maya, i. e. of the unreal illusory character of the\nsensible world, does not constitute a feature of the primitive philosophy of\nthe Upanishads, but was introduced into the system at some later period,\nwhether by Badaraya _n_ a or _S_ a _n_ kara or somebody else. The opposite\nview, viz. that the doctrine of Maya forms an integral element of the teaching\nof the Upanishads, is implied in them everywhere, and enunciated more or less\ndistinctly in\n\np. cxvii\n\nmore than one place, has in recent times been advocated with much force by Mr.\nGough in the ninth chapter of his Philosophy of the Upanishads.\n\nIn his Materiaux, &c. M. Paul Regnaud remarks that \'the doctrine of Maya,\nalthough implied in the teaching of the Upanishads, could hardly become clear\nand explicit before the system had reached a stage of development\nnecessitating a choice between admitting two co-existent eternal principles\n(which became the basis of the Sa _n_ khya philosophy), and accepting the\npredominance of the intellectual principle, which in the end necessarily led\nto the negation of the opposite principle.\'--To the two alternatives here\nreferred to as possible we, however, have to add a third one, viz. that form\nof the Vedanta of which the theory of the Bhagavatas or Ramanu _g_ as is the\nmost eminent type, and according to which Brahman carries within its own\nnature an element from which the material universe originates; an element\nwhich indeed is not an independent entity like the pradhana of the Sa _n_\nkhyas, but which at the same time is not an unreal Maya but quite as real as\nany other part of Brahman\'s nature. That a doctrine of this character actually\ndeveloped itself on the basis of the Upanishads, is a circumstance which we\nclearly must not lose sight of, when attempting to determine what the\nUpanishads themselves are teaching concerning the character of the world.\n\nIn enquiring whether the Upanishads maintain the Maya doctrine or not, we must\nproceed with the same caution as regards other parts of the system, i.e. we\nmust refrain from using unhesitatingly, and without careful consideration of\nthe merits of each individual case, the teaching--direct or inferred--of any\none passage to the end of determining the drift of the teaching of other\npassages. We may admit that some passages, notably of the B _ri_ hadara _n_\nyaka, contain at any rate the germ of the later developed Maya doctrine 1, and\nthus render it quite intelligible that a system like _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\n\np. cxviii\n\nshould evolve itself, among others, out of the Upanishads; but that affords no\nvalid reason for interpreting Maya into other texts which give a very\nsatisfactory sense without that doctrine, or are even clearly repugnant to it.\nThis remark applies in the very first place to all the accounts of the\ncreation of the physical universe. There, if anywhere, the illusional\ncharacter of the world should have been hinted at, at least, had that theory\nbeen held by the authors of those accounts; but not a word to that effect is\nmet with anywhere. The most important of those accounts--the one given in the\nsixth chapter of the _Kh_ andogya Upanishad--forms no exception. There is\nabsolutely no reason to assume that the \'sending forth\' of the elements from\nthe primitive Sat, which is there described at length, was by the writer of\nthat passage meant to represent a vivarta rather than a pari _n_ ama that the\nprocess of the origination of the physical universe has to be conceived as\nanything else but a real manifestation of real powers hidden in the primeval\nSelf. The introductory words, addressed to _S_ vetaketu by Uddalaka, which are\ngenerally appealed to as intimating the unreal character of the evolution\nabout to be described, do not, if viewed impartially, intimate any such thing\n1. For what is capable of being proved, and manifestly meant to be proved, by\nthe illustrative instances of the lump of clay and the nugget of gold, through\nwhich there are known all things made of clay and gold? Merely that this whole\nworld has Brahman for its causal substance, just as clay is the causal matter\nof every earthen pot, and gold of every golden ornament, but not that the\nprocess through which any causal substance becomes an effect is an unreal one.\nWe--including Uddalaka--may surely say that all earthen pots are in reality\nnothing but earth--the earthen pot being merely a special modification\n(vikara) of clay which has a name of its own--without thereby committing\nourselves to the doctrine that the change of form, which a lump of clay\nundergoes when being fashioned into a pot, is not real but a mere baseless\nillusion.\n\nIn the same light we have to view numerous other passages\n\np. cxix\n\nwhich set forth the successive emanations proceeding from the first principle.\nWhen, for instance, we meet in the Ka _th_ a Up. I, 3, 10, in the serial\nenumeration of the forms of existence intervening between the gross material\nworld and the highest Self (the Person), with the \'avyak _ri_ ta,\' the\nUndeveloped, immediately below the purusha; and when again the Mu _nd_ aka Up.\nII, 1, 2, speaks of the \'high Imperishable\' higher than which is the heavenly\nPerson; there is no reason whatever to see in that \'Undeveloped\' and that\n\'high Imperishable\' anything but that real element in Brahman from which, as\nin the Ramanu _g_ a system, the material universe springs by a process of real\ndevelopment. We must of course render it quite clear to ourselves in what\nsense the terms \'real\' and \'unreal\' have to be understood. The Upanishads no\ndoubt teach emphatically that the material world does not owe its existence to\nany principle independent from the Lord like the pradhana of the Sa _n_ khyas;\nthe world is nothing but a manifestation of the Lord\'s wonderful power, and\nhence is unsubstantial, if we take the term \'substance\' in its strict sense.\nAnd, again, everything material is immeasurably inferior in nature to the\nhighest spiritual principle from which it has emanated, and which it now hides\nfrom the individual soul. But neither unsubstantiality nor inferiority of the\nkind mentioned constitutes unreality in the sense in which the Maya of _S_ a\n_n_ kara is unreal. According to the latter the whole world is nothing but an\nerroneous appearance, as unreal as the snake, for which a piece of rope is\nmistaken by the belated traveller, and disappearing just as the imagined snake\ndoes as soon as the light of true knowledge has risen. But this is certainly\nnot the impression left on the mind by a comprehensive review of the\nUpanishads which dwells on their general scope, and does not confine itself to\nthe undue urging of what may be implied in some detached passages. The\nUpanishads do not call upon us to look upon the whole world as a baseless\nillusion to be destroyed by knowledge; the great error which they admonish us\nto relinquish is rather that things have a separate individual existence, and\nare not tied together by the bond of being all of them effects\n\np. cxx\n\nof Brahman, or Brahman itself. They do not say that true knowledge sublates\nthis false world, as _S_ a _n_ kara says, but that it enables the sage to\nextricate himself from the world--the inferior murta rupa of Brahman, to use\nan expression of the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka--and to become one with Brahman in\nits highest form. \'We are to see everything in Brahman, and Brahman in\neverything;\' the natural meaning of this is, \'we are to look upon this whole\nworld as a true manifestation of Brahman, as sprung from it and animated by\nit.\' The mayavadin has indeed appropriated the above saying also, and\ninterpreted it so as to fall in with his theory; but he is able to do so only\nby perverting its manifest sense. For him it would be appropriate to say, not\nthat everything we see is in Brahman, but rather that everything we see is out\nof Brahman, viz. as a false appearance spread over it and hiding it from us.\n\nStress has been laid 1 upon certain passages of the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka\nwhich seem to hint at the unreality of this world by qualifying terms,\nindicative of duality or plurality of existence, by means of an added \'iva,\'\ni.e. \'as it were\' (yatranyad iva syat; yatra dvaitam iva bhavati; atma\ndhyayativa lelayativa). Those passages no doubt readily lend themselves to\nMaya interpretations, and it is by no means impossible that in their author\'s\nmind there was something like an undeveloped Maya doctrine. I must, however,\nremark that they, on the other hand, also admit of easy interpretations not in\nany way presupposing the theory of the unreality of the world. If Ya _g\n\xc3\xb1_avalkya refers to the latter as that \'where there is something else as it\nwere, where there is duality as it were,\' he may simply mean to indicate that\nthe ordinary opinion, according to which the individual forms of existence of\nthe world are opposed to each other as altogether separate, is a mistaken one,\nall things being one in so far as they spring from--and are parts of--Brahman.\nThis would in no way involve duality or plurality being unreal in _S_ a _n_\nkara\'s sense, not any more than, for instance, the modes of Spinoza are unreal\nbecause, according to that philosopher, there is only one universal\n\np. cxxi\n\nsubstance. And with regard to the clause \'the Self thinks as it were\' it has\nto be noted that according to the commentators the \'as it were\' is meant to\nindicate that truly not the Self is thinking, but the upadhis, i.e. especially\nthe manas with which the Self is connected. But whether these upadhis are the\nmere offspring of Maya, as _S_ a _n_ kara thinks, or real forms of existence,\nas Ramanu _g_ a teaches, is an altogether different question.\n\nI do not wish, however, to urge these last observations, and am ready to admit\nthat not impossibly those iva\'s indicate that the thought of the writer who\nemployed them was darkly labouring with a conception akin to--although much\nless explicit than--the Maya of _S_ a _n_ kara. But what I object to is, that\nconclusions drawn from a few passages of, after all, doubtful import should be\nemployed for introducing the Maya doctrine into other passages which do not\neven hint at it, and are fully intelligible without it 1.\n\nThe last important point in the teaching of the Upanishads we have to touch\nupon is the relation of the _g_ ivas, the individual souls to the highest\nSelf. The special views regarding that point held by _S_ a _n_ kara and Ramanu\n_g_ a, as have been stated before. Confronting their theories with the texts\nof the Upanishads we must, I think, admit without hesitation, that _S_ a _n_\nkara\'s doctrine faithfully represents the prevailing teaching of the\nUpanishads in one important point at least, viz. therein that the soul or Self\nof the sage--whatever its original relation to Brahman may be--is in the end\ncompletely merged and indistinguishably lost in the universal Self. A\ndistinction, repeatedly alluded to before, has indeed to be kept in view here\nalso. Certain texts of the Upanishads describe the soul\'s going upwards, on\nthe path of the gods, to the world of Brahman, where it dwells for unnumbered\nyears, i.e. for ever. Those texts, as a type of which we may take, the passage\nKaushit. Up. I--the fundamental text of the Ramanu _g_ a\'s concerning the\nsoul\'s\n\np. cxxii\n\nfate after death--belong to an earlier stage of philosophic development; they\nmanifestly ascribe to the soul a continued individual existence. But mixed\nwith texts of this class there are others in which the final absolute\nidentification of the individual Self with the universal Self is indicated in\nterms of unmistakable plainness. \'He who knows Brahman and becomes Brahman;\'\n\'he who knows Brahman becomes all this;\' \'as the flowing rivers disappear in\nthe sea losing their name and form, thus a wise man goes to the divine\nperson.\' And if we look to the whole, to the prevailing spirit of the\nUpanishads, we may call the doctrine embodied in passages of the latter nature\nthe doctrine of the Upanishads. It is, moreover, supported by the frequently\nand clearly stated theory of the individual souls being merged in Brahman in\nthe state of deep dreamless sleep.\n\nIt is much more difficult to indicate the precise teaching of the Upanishads\nconcerning the original relation of the individual soul to the highest Self,\nalthough there can be no doubt that it has to be viewed as proceeding from the\nlatter, and somehow forming a part of it. Negatively we are entitled to say\nthat the doctrine, according to which the soul is merely brahma bhrantam or\nbrahma mayopadhikam, is in no way countenanced by the majority of the passages\nbearing on the question. If the emission of the elements, described in the\n_Kh_ andogya and referred to above, is a real process--of which we saw no\nreason to doubt--the _g_ iva atman with which the highest Self enters into the\nemitted elements is equally real, a true part or emanation of Brahman itself.\n\nAfter having in this way shortly reviewed the chief elements of Vedantic\ndoctrine according to the Upanishads, we may briefly consider _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\nsystem and mode of interpretation--with whose details we had frequent\nopportunities of finding fault--as a whole. It has been said before that the\ntask of reducing the teaching of the whole of the Upanishads to a system\nconsistent and free from contradictions is an intrinsically impossible one.\nBut the task once being given, we are quite ready to admit that _S_ a _n_\nkara\'s system is most probably the best which can be devised.\n\np. cxxiii\n\nWhile unable to allow that the Upanishads recognise a lower and higher\nknowledge of Brahman, in fact the distinction of a lower and higher Brahman,\nwe yet acknowledge that the adoption of that distinction furnishes the\ninterpreter with an instrument of extraordinary power for reducing to an\norderly whole the heterogeneous material presented by the old theosophic\ntreatises. This becomes very manifest as soon as we compare _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\nsystem with that of Ramanu _g_ a. The latter recognises only one Brahman which\nis, as we should say, a personal God, and he therefore lays stress on all\nthose passages of the Upanishads which ascribe to Brahman the attributes of a\npersonal God, such as omniscience and omnipotence. Those passages, on the\nother hand, whose decided tendency it is to represent Brahman as transcending\nall qualities, as one undifferenced mass of impersonal intelligence, Ramanu\n_g_ a is unable to accept frankly and fairly, and has to misinterpret them\nmore or less to make them fall in with his system. The same remark holds good\nwith regard to those texts which represent the individual soul as finally\nidentifying itself with Brahman; Ramanu _g_ a cannot allow a complete\nidentification but merely an assimilation carried as far as possible. _S_ a\n_n_ kara, on the other hand, by skilfully ringing the changes on a higher and\na lower doctrine, somehow manages to find room for whatever the Upanishads\nhave to say. Where the text speaks of Brahman as transcending all attributes,\nthe highest doctrine is set forth. Where Brahman is called the All-knowing\nruler of the world, the author means to propound the lower knowledge of the\nLord only. And where the legends about the primary being and its way of\ncreating the world become somewhat crude and gross, Hira _n_ yagarbha and Vira\n_g_ are summoned forth and charged with the responsibility. Of Vira _g_ Mr.\nGough remarks (p. 55) that in him a place is provided by the poets of the\nUpanishads for the purusha of the ancient _ri_ shis, the divine being out of\nwhom the visible and tangible world proceeded. This is quite true if only we\nsubstitute for the \'poets of the Upanishads\' the framers of the orthodox\nVedanta system--for the Upanishads give no indication whatever\n\np. cxxiv\n\nthat by their purusha they understand not the simple old purusha but the Vira\n_g_ occupying a definite position in a highly elaborate system;--but the mere\nphrase, \'providing a place\' intimates with sufficient clearness the nature of\nthe work in which systematisers of the Vedantic doctrine are engaged.\n\n[paragraph continues] _S_ a _n_ kara\'s method thus enables him in a certain\nway to do justice to different stages of historical development, to recognise\nclearly existing differences which other systematisers are intent on\nobliterating. And there has yet to be made a further and even more important\nadmission in favour of his system. It is not only more pliable, more capable\nof amalgamating heterogeneous material than other systems, but its fundamental\ndoctrines are manifestly in greater harmony with the essential teaching of the\nUpanishads than those of other Vedantic systems. Above we were unable to allow\nthat the distinction made by _S_ a _n_ kara between Brahman and \xc3\x8e _s_ vara is\nknown to the Upanishads; but we must now admit that if, for the purpose of\ndetermining the nature of the highest being, a choice has to be made between\nthose texts which represent Brahman as nirgu _n_ a, and those which ascribe to\nit personal attributes, _S_ a _n_ kara is right in giving preference to texts\nof the former kind. The Brahman of the old Upanishads, from which the souls\nspring to enjoy individual consciousness in their waking state, and into which\nthey sink back temporarily in the state of deep dreamless sleep and\npermanently in death, is certainly not represented adequately by the strictly\npersonal \xc3\x8e _s_ vara of Ramanu _g_ a, who rules the world in wisdom and mercy.\nThe older Upanishads, at any rate, lay very little stress upon personal\nattributes of their highest being, and hence _S_ a _n_ kara is right in so far\nas he assigns to his hypostatised personal \xc3\x8e _s_ vara 1 a lower place than to\nhis absolute Brahman. That he also faithfully represents the prevailing spirit\nof the Upanishads in his theory of the ultimate fate\n\np. cxxv\n\nof the soul, we have already remarked above. And although the Maya doctrine\ncannot, in my opinion, be said to form part of the teaching of the Upanishads,\nit cannot yet be asserted to contradict it openly, because the very point\nwhich it is meant to elucidate, viz. the mode in which the physical universe\nand the multiplicity of individual souls originate, is left by the Upanishads\nvery much in the dark. The later growth of the Maya doctrine on the basis of\nthe Upanishads is therefore quite intelligible, and I fully agree with Mr.\nGough when he says regarding it that there has been no addition to the system\nfrom without but only a development from within, no graft but only growth. The\nlines of thought which finally led to the elaboration of the full-blown Maya\ntheory may be traced with considerable certainty. In the first place,\ndeepening speculation on Brahman tended to the notion of advaita being taken\nin a more and more strict sense, as implying not only the exclusion of any\nsecond principle external to Brahman, but also the absence of any elements of\nduality or plurality in the nature of the one universal being itself; a\ntendency agreeing with the spirit of a certain set of texts from the\nUpanishads. And as the fact of the appearance of a manifold world cannot be\ndenied, the only way open to thoroughly consistent speculation was to deny at\nany rate its reality, and to call it a mere illusion due to an unreal\nprinciple, with which Brahman is indeed associated, but which is unable to\nbreak the unity of Brahman\'s nature just on account of its own unreality. And,\nin the second place, a more thorough following out of the conception that the\nunion with Brahman is to be reached through true knowledge only, not\nunnaturally led to the conclusion that what separates us in our unenlightened\nstate from Brahman is such as to allow itself to be completely sublated by an\nact of knowledge; is, in other words, nothing else but an erroneous notion, an\nillusion.--A further circumstance which may not impossibly have co-operated to\nfurther the development of the theory of the world\'s unreality will be\nreferred to later on. 1\n\np. cxxvi\n\nWe have above been obliged to leave it an open question what kind of Vedanta\nis represented by the Vedanta-sutras, although reason was shown for the\nsupposition that in some important points their teaching is more closely\nrelated to the system of Ramanu _g_ a than to that of _S_ a _n_ kara. If so,\nthe philosophy of _S_ a _n_ kara would on the whole stand nearer to the\nteaching of the Upanishads than the Sutras of Badaraya _n_ a. This would\nindeed be a somewhat unexpected conclusion--for, judging a priori, we should\nbe more inclined to assume a direct propagation of the true doctrine of the\nUpanishads through Badaraya _n_ a to _S_ a _n_ kara--but a priori\nconsiderations have of course no weight against positive evidence to the\ncontrary. There are, moreover, other facts in the history of Indian philosophy\nand theology which help us better to appreciate the possibility of Badaraya\n_n_ a\'s Sutras already setting forth a doctrine that lays greater stress on\nthe personal character of the highest being than is in agreement with the\nprevailing tendency of the Upanishads. That the pure doctrine of those ancient\nBrahminical treatises underwent at a rather early period amalgamations with\nbeliefs which most probably had sprung up in altogether different--priestly or\nnon-priestly--communities is a well-known circumstance; it suffices for our\npurposes to refer to the most eminent of the early literary monuments in which\nan amalgamation of the kind mentioned is observable, viz. the Bhagavadgita.\nThe doctrine of the Bhagavadgita represents a fusion of the Brahman theory of\nthe Upanishads with the belief in a personal highest being--K _ri_ sh _n_ a or\nVish _n_ u--which in many respects approximates very closely to the system of\nthe Bhagavatas; the attempts of a certain set of Indian commentators to\nexplain it as setting forth pure Vedanta, i.e. the pure doctrine of the\nUpanishads, may simply be set aside. But this same Bhagavadgita is quoted in\nBadaraya _n_ a\'s Sutras (at least according to the unanimous explanations of\nthe most eminent scholiasts of different schools) as inferior to _S_ ruti only\nin authority. The Sutras,\n\np. cxxvii\n\nmoreover, refer in different places to certain Vedantic portions of the\nMahabharata, especially the twelfth book, several of which represent forms of\nVedanta distinctly differing from _S_ a _n_ kara\'s teaching, and closely\nrelated to the system of the Bhagavatas.\n\nFacts of this nature--from entering into the details of which we are prevented\nby want of space--tend to mitigate the prima facie strangeness of the\nassumption that the Vedanta-sutras, which occupy an intermediate position\nbetween the Upanishads and _S_ a _n_ kara, should yet diverge in their\nteaching from both. The Vedanta of Gau _d_ apada and _S_ a _n_ kara would in\nthat case mark a strictly orthodox reaction against all combinations of non-\nVedic elements of belief and doctrine with the teaching of the Upanishads. But\nalthough this form of doctrine has ever since _S_ a _n_ kara\'s time been the\none most generally accepted by Brahminic students of philosophy, it has never\nhad any wide-reaching influence on the masses of India. It is too little in\nsympathy with the wants of the human heart, which, after all, are not so very\ndifferent in India from what they are elsewhere. Comparatively few, even in\nIndia, are those who rejoice in the idea of a universal non-personal essence\nin which their own individuality is to be merged and lost for ever, who think\nit sweet \'to be wrecked on the ocean of the Infinite 1.\' The only forms of\nVedantic philosophy which are--and can at any time have been--really popular,\nare those in which the Brahman of the Upanishads has somehow transformed\nitself into a being, between which and the devotee there can exist a personal\nrelation, love and faith on the part of man, justice tempered by mercy on the\npart of the divinity. The only religious books of widespread influence are\nsuch as the Ramayan of Tulsidas, which lay no stress on the distinction\nbetween an absolute Brahman inaccessible to all human wants and sympathies,\nand a shadowy Lord whose very conception depends on the illusory principle of\nMaya, but love to dwell on the delights of devotion\n\np. cxxviii\n\nto one all-wise and merciful ruler, who is able and willing to lend a gracious\near to the supplication of the worshipper.\n\n________________________\n\nThe present translation of the Vedanta-sutras does not aim at rendering that\nsense which their author may have aimed at conveying, but strictly follows _S_\na _n_ kara\'s interpretation. The question as to how far the latter agrees with\nthe views held by Badaraya _n_ a has been discussed above, with the result\nthat for the present it must, on the whole, be left an open one. In any case\nit would not be feasible to combine a translation of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s\ncommentary with an independent version of the Sutras which it explains.\nSimilar considerations have determined the method followed in rendering the\npassages of the Upanishads referred to in the Sutras and discussed at length\nby _S_ a _n_ kara. There also the views of the commentator have to be followed\nclosely; otherwise much of the comment would appear devoid of meaning. Hence,\nwhile of course following on the whole the critical translation published by\nProfessor Max Muller in the earlier volumes of this Series, I had, in a not\ninconsiderable number of cases, to modify it so as to render intelligible _S_\na _n_ kara\'s explanations and reasonings. I hope to find space in the\nintroduction to the second volume of this translation for making some general\nremarks on the method to be followed in translating the Upanishads.\n\nI regret that want of space has prevented me from extracting fuller notes from\nlater scholiasts. The notes given are based, most of them, on the _t_ ikas\ncomposed by \xc3\x82nandagiri and Govindananda (the former of which is unpublished as\nyet, so far as I know), and on the Bhamati.\n\nMy best thanks are due to Pa _nd_ its Rama Mi _s_ ra _S_ astrin and Ga _n_\ngadhara _S_ astrin of the Benares Sanskrit College, whom I have consulted on\nseveral difficult passages. Greater still are my obligations to Pa _nd_ it Ke\n_s_ ava _S_ astrin, of the same institution, who most kindly undertook to read\na proof of the whole of the present volume, and whose advice has enabled me to\nrender my version of more than one passage more definite or correct.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lxxviii:1](sbe34006.htm#fr_23) Nanu vidusho#pi setikartavyatakopasananirv\n_ri_ ttaye v _ri_ sh _t_ yannadiphalanish _t_ any eva katha _m_ tesha _m_\nvirodhad vina _s_ a u _k_ yate.

That this personal\nconscious being is at the same time identified with the totality of the\nindividual souls in the unconscious state of deep dreamless sleep, is one of\nthose extraordinary contradictions which thorough-going systematisers of\nVedantic doctrine are apparently unable to avoid altogether.\n\n[cxxv:1](sbe34006.htm#fr_34) That section of the introduction in which the\npoint referred to in the text p. cxxvi is touched upon will I hope form part\nof the second volume of the translation.
