Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# RAMAYANA BOOK XI\n\n# RAJYA-ABHISHEKA\n\n_\n\n(Rama\'s Return and Consecration)\n\n_\n\nTHE real Epic ends with the war, and with Rama\'s happy return to Ayodhya. Sita\nproves her stainless virtue by an Ordeal of Fire, and returns with her lord\nand with Lakshman in an aerial car, which Ravan had won from the Gods, and\nwhich Bibhishan made over to Rama. Indian poets are never tired of\ndescriptions of nature, and the poet of the Ramayana takes advantage of Rama\'s\njourney from Ceylon to Oudh to give us a bird\'s-eye view of the whole\ncontinent of India, as well as to recapitulate the principal incidents of his\ngreat Epic.\n\nThe gathering of men at Ayodhya, the greetings to Rama, and his consecration\nby the Vedic bard Vasishtha, are among the most pleasing passages in the whole\npoem. And the happiness enjoyed by men during the reign of Rama--described in\nthe last few couplets of this Book--is an article of belief and a living\ntradition in India to this day.\n\nThe portions translated in this Book form the whole or portions of Sections\ncxviii., cxx., cxxv., cxxix., and cxxx. of Book vi. of the original text.\n\n## I\n\n## ORDEAL BY FIRE\n\nFor she dwelt in Ravan\'s dwelling--rumour clouds a woman\'s fame--  \nRighteous Rama\'s brow was clouded, saintly Sita, spake in shame:\n\n"Wherefore spake ye not, my Rama, if your bosom doubts my faith,  \nDearer than a dark suspicion to a woman were her death!\n\nWherefore, Rama, with your token came your vassal o\'er the wave,  \nTo assist a fallen woman and a tainted wife to save,\n\nWherefore with vour mighty forces crossed the ocean in your pride,  \nRisked your fife in endless combats for a sin-polluted bride?\n\nHast thou, Rama, all forgotten?--Saintly Janak saw my birth,  \nChild of harvest-bearing furrow, Sita sprang from Mother Earth,\n\nAs a maiden true and stainless unto thee I gave my hand,  \nAs a consort fond and faithful roved with thee from land to land!\n\nBut a woman pleadeth vainly when suspicion clouds her name,  \nLakshman, if thou lov\'st thy sister, light for me the funeral flame,\n\nWhen the shadow of dishonour darkens o\'er a woman\'s life,  \nDeath alone is friend and refuge of a true and trustful wife,\n\nWhen a righteous lord and husband turns his cold averted eyes,  \nFuneraI flame dispels suspicion, honour lives when woman dies!"\n\nDark was Rama\'s gloomy visage and his lips were firmly sealed,  \nAnd his eye betraved no weakness, word disclosed no thought concealed,\n\nSilent heaved his heart in anguish, silent drooped his tortured head,  \nLakshman with a throbbing bosom funeral pyre for Sita made,\n\nAnd Videha\'s sinless daughter prayed unto the Gods above,  \nOn her lord and wedded consort cast her dying looks of love!\n\n_\n\n"If in act and thought," she uttered, " I am true unto my name,  \nWitness of our sins and virtues, may this Fire protect my fame!\n\nIf a false and lying scandal brings a faithful woman shame,  \nWitness of our sins and virtues, may this Fire protect my fame!\n\nIf in lifelong loving duty I am free from sin and blame,  \nWitness of our sins and virtues, may this Fire protect my fame!"\n\n_\n\nFearless in her faith and valour Sita stepped upon the pyre,  \nAnd her form of beauty vanished circled by the clasping fire,\n\nAnd an anguish shook the people like the ocean tempest-tost,  \nOld and young and maid and matron wept for Sita true and lost,\n\nFor bedecked in golden splendour and in gems and rich attire,  \nSita vanished in the red fire of the newly lighted pyre!\n\nRishis and the great Gandharvas, Gods who know each secret deed,  \nWitnessed Sita\'s high devotion and a woman\'s lofty creed,\n\nAnd the earth by ocean girdled with its wealth of teeming life,  \nWitnessed deed of dauntless duty of a true and stainless wife!\n\n## II\n\n## WOMAN\'S TRUTH VINDICATED\n\nSlow the red flames rolled asunder, God of Fire incarnate came,  \nHolding in his radiant bosom fair Videha\'s sinless dame,\n\nNot a curl upon her tresses, not a blossom on her brow,  \nNot a fibre of her mantle did with tarnished lustre glow!\n\nWitness of our sins and virtues, God of Fire incarnate spake,  \nBade the sorrow-stricken Rama back his sinless wife to take:\n\n"Ravan in his impious folly forced from thee thy faithful dame,  \nGuarded by her changeless virtue, Sita still remains the same,\n\nTempted oft by female Rakshas in the dark and dismal wood,  \nIn her woe and in her sadness true to thee hath Sita stood,\n\nCourted oft by royal Ravan in the forest far and lone,  \nTrue to wedded troth and virtue Sita thought of thee alone,\n\nPare is she in thought and action, pure and stainless, true and meek,  \nI, the witness of all actions, thus my sacred mandate speak!"\n\nRama\'s forehead was unclouded and a radiance lit his eye,  \nAnd his bosom heaved in gladness as he spake in accents high:\n\nNever from the time I saw her in her maiden days of youth,  \nHave I doubted Sita\'s virtue, Sita\'s fixed and changeless truth,\n\nI have known her ever sinless,--let the world her virtue know,  \nFor the God of Fire is witness to her truth and changeless vow!\n\nRavan in his pride and passion conquered not a woman\'s love,  \nFor the virtuous like the bright fire in their native radiance move,\n\nRavan in his rage and folly conquered not a faithful wife,  \nFor like ray of sun unsullied is a righteous woman\'s life,\n\nBe the wide world now a witness,-pure and stainless is my dame,  \nRama shall not leave his consort till he leaves his righteous fame!"\n\nIn his tears the contrite Rama clasped her in a soft embrace,  \nAnd the fond forgiving Sita in his bosom hid her face!\n\n## III\n\n## RETURN HOME BY THE A\xc3\x8bRIAL CAR\n\n"Mark my love," so Rama uttered, as on flying Pushpa car,  \nBorne by swans, the home-returning exiles left the field of war,\n\n"Lanka\'s proud and castled city on Trikuta\'s triple crest,  \nAs on peaks of bold Kailasa mansions of Immortals rest!\n\nMark the gory fields surrounding where the Vanars in their might,  \nFaced and fought the charging Rakshas in the long and deathful fight,\n\nIndrajit and Kumbha-kama, Ravan and his chieftains slain,  \nFell upon the field of battle and their red blood soaks the plain.\n\nMark where dark-eyed Mandodari, Ravan\'s slender-waisted wife,  \nWept her widow\'s tears of anguish when her monarch lost his life,\n\nShe hath dried her tears of sorrow and bestowed her heart and hand,  \nOn Bibhisban good and faitbful, crowned king of Lanka\'s land.\n\nSee my love, round Ceylon\'s island how the ocean billows roar.  \nHiding pearls in eaves of corals, strewing shells upon the shore,\n\nAnd the causeway far-extending,--monument of Rama\'s fame,--  \n\'Rama\'s Bridge\' to distant ages shall our deathless deeds proclaim!\n\nSee the rock-bound fair Kishkindha and her mountain-girdled town,  \nWhere I slayed the warrior Bali, placed Sugriva on the throne,\n\nAnd the hill of Rishyamuka where Sugriva first I met,  \nGave him word,--he would be monarch ere the evening\'s Sun had set.\n\nSee the sacred lake of Pampa by whose wild and echoing shore,  \nRama poured his lamentations when he saw his wife no more,\n\nAnd the woods of Janasthana where Jatayu fought and bled,  \nWhen the deep deceitful Ravan with my trusting Sita fled.\n\nDost thou mark, my soft-eyed Sita, cottage on the river\'s shore,  \nWhere in righteous peace and penance Sita, lived in days of yore,\n\nAnd by gloomy Godavari, Saint Agastya\'s home of love,  \nHoly men by holy duties sanctify the sacred grove!\n\nDost thou, o\'er the Dandak forest, view the Chitrakuta hill.  \nDeathless bard the Saint Valmiki haunts its shade and crystal rill,\n\nThither came the righteous Bharat and my loving mother came,  \nLonging in their hearts to take us to Ayodhya\'s town of fame,\n\nDost thou, dear devoted Sita, see the Jumna in her might \'  \nWhere in Bharad-waja\'s _asram_ passed we, love, a happy, night,\n\nAnd the broad and ruddy Ganga sweeping in her regal pride,  \nForest-dweller faithful Guha crossed us to the southern side.\n\nJoy! joy! my gentle Sita,! Fair Ayodhya looms above,  \nAncient seat of Raghu\'s empire, nest of Rama\'s hope and love,\n\nBow, bow, to bright Ayodhya! Darksome did the exiles roam,  \nNow their weary toil is ended in their father\'s ancient home!\n\n## IV\n\n## GREETINGS\n\nMessage from returning Rama, Vanars to Ayodhya brought,  \nRighteous Bharat gave his mandate with a holy joy distraught:\n\n"Let our city shrines and _chaityas_ with a lofty music shake,  \nAnd ourpriests to bright Immortals grateful gifts and offerings make,\n\nBards, reciters of _Puranas_ , minstrels versed in ancient song,  \nWomen with their tuneful voices lays of sacred love prolong,\n\nLet our queens and stately courtiers step in splendour and in state,  \nChieftains with their marshalled forces range along the city gate,\n\nAnd our white-robed holy Brahmans hymn and sacred _mantras_ sing.  \nOffer greetings to our brother, render homage to our king!"\n\nBrave Satrughna heard his elder and his mandate duly kept:  \n"Be our great and sacred city levelled, cleansed, and duly swept,\n\nAnd the grateful earth be sprinkled with the water from the well,  \nStrewn with parched rice and offering and with flower of sweetest smell,\n\nOn each turret, tower, and temple let our flags and colours wave,  \nOn the gates of proud Ayodhya plant Ayodhya\'a banners brave,\n\nGay festoons of flowering creeper home and street and dwelling line,  \nAnd in gold and glittering garment let the gladdened city shine.\n\nElephants in golden trappings thousand chiefs and nobles bore.  \nChariots, cars, and gallant chargers speeding by Sarayu\'s shore,\n\nAnd the serried troops of battle marched with colours rich and brave,  \nProudly o\'er the gay procession did, Ayodhya\'s banners wave.\n\nIn their stately gilded litters royal dames and damsels came,  \nQueen Kausalya first and foremost, Queen Sumitra rich in fame,\n\nPious priest and learned Brahman, chief of guild from near and far,  \nNoble chief and stately courtier with the wreath and water jar.\n\nGirt by minstrel, bard, and herald chanting glorious deeds of yore,  \nBharat came,--his elder\'s sandals still the faithful younger bore,--\n\nSilver-white his proud umbrella, silver-white his garland brave,  \nSilver-white the fan of _chowri_ which his faithful henchmen wave,\n\nStately march of gallant chargers and the roll of battle car,  \nHeavy tread of royal tuskers and the beat of drum of war,\n\n_\n\nDundubhi_ and echoing _sankha_ , voice of nations gathered nigh,  \nShook the city\'s tower and temple and the pealing vault of sky!\n\nSailing o\'er the cloudless ether Rama\'s Pushpa chariot came,  \nAnd ten thousand jocund voices shouted Rama\'s joyous name,\n\nWomen with their loving greetings, children with their joyous cry,  \nTottering age and lisping infant hailed the righteous chief and high.\n\nBharat lifted up his glances unto Rama from afar,  \nUnto Sita, unto Lakshman, seated on the Pushpa car,\n\nAnd he wafted high his greetings and he poured his pious lay,  \nAs one wafts the chaunted mantra to the rising God of Day!\n\nSilver swans by Rama\'s bidding soft descended from the air,  \nAnd on earth the chariot lighted,--car of flowers divinely fair,--\n\nBharat mounting on the chariot, sought his long-lost elder\'s grace,  \nRama held his faithful younger in a brother\'s dear embrace.\n\nWith his greetings unto Lakshman, unto Rama\'s faithful dame,  \nTo Bibhishan and Sugriva and each chief who thither came,\n\nBharat took the jewelled sandals with the rarest gems inlaid,  \nPlaced them at the feet of Rama and in humble accents said:\n\n"Tokens of thy rule and empire, _these_ have filled thy royal throne,  \nFaithful to his trust and duty Bharat renders back thine own,\n\nBharat\'s life is joy and gladness, for returned from distant shore,  \nThou shalt rule thy spacious kingdom and thy loyal men once more,\n\nThou shalt hold thy rightful empire and assume thy royal crown,  \nFaithful to his trust and duty, Bharat renders back thine own,\n\n## V\n\n## THE CONSECRATION\n\nJoy! joy in bright Ayodhya gladness filled the hearts of all,  \nJoy! joy a lofty music sounded in the royal hall,\n\nFourteen years of woe were ended, Rama now assumed his own,  \nAnd they placed the weary wand\'rer on his father\'s ancient throne,\n\nAnd they brought the sacred water from each distant stream and hill,  \nFrom the vast and boundless ocean, from each far and sacred rill.\n\nVasishtha, the Bard of Vedas with auspicious rites and meet  \nPlaced the monarch and his consort on the gemmed and jewelled seat,\n\nGautama. and Katyayana, Vamadeva priest of yore,  \nJabali and wise Vijaya verged in holy ancient lore,\n\nPoured the fresh and fraurant water on the consecrated kine,  \nAs the Gods anointed INDRA from the pure ethereal spring!\n\nVedic priests with sacred mantra, dark-eyed virgins with their song,  \nWarriors girt in arms and weapons round the crowned monarch throng,\n\nJuices from each fragrant creeper on his royal brow they place,  \nAnd his father\'s crown and jewels Rama\'s ample forehead grace,\n\nAnd as Manu, first of monarchs, was enthroned in days of yore,  \nSo was Rama consecrated by the priests of Vedic lore!\n\nBrave Satrughna on his brother cast the white umbrella\'s shade  \nBold Sugriva and Bibhishan waved the _chowri_ gem-inlaid,\n\nVAYU, God of gentle zephyrs, gift of golden garland lent,  \nINDRA, God of rain and sunshine, wreath of pearls to Rama sent,\n\nGay _Gandharvas_ raised the music, fair _Apsaras_ formed the ring,  \nMen in nations hailed their Rama as their lord and righteous king!\n\n_\n\nAnd tis told by ancient sages, during Rama\'s happy reign,  \nDeath untimely, dire diseases came not to his subject men,\n\nWidows wept not in their sorrow for their lords untimely lost,  \nMothers wailed not in their anguish for their babes by YAMA crost,\n\nRobbers, cheats, and gay deceivers tempted not with lying word,  \nNeighbour loved his righteous neighbour and the people loved their lord!\n\nTrees their ample produce yielded as returning seasons went,  \nAnd the earth in grateful gladness never failing harvest lent,\n\nRains descended in their season, never came the blighting gale,  \nRich in crop and rich in pasture was each soft and smiling vale,\n\nLoom and anvil gave their produce and the tilled and fertile soil,  \nAnd the nation lived rejoicing in their old ancestral.\n\n_\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XII: Sacrifice of the Horse](rama12.htm)\n\n'
