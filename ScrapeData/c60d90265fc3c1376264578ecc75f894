While they are eating, he looks at them with (the words), 'My soul (atman)\ndwells in the Brahman that it may be immortal.'\n\nWhen they have eaten (and go away), he goes after them and asks for their\npermission to take the remains of their meal (for the rites which he is going\n\np. 229\n\nto perform). Then he takes a water-pot and a handful of Darbha grass, goes\nforth to a place that lies in a south-easterly intermediate direction, spreads\nthe Darbha grass out with its points towards the south, and pours out on that\n(grass) with downward-turned hands, ending in the south, three handfuls of\nwater, with (the formulas), 'May the fathers, the friends of Soma, wipe\nthemselves! May the grandfathers . . . the great-grandfathers, the friends of\nSoma, wipe themselves!' or, 'N.N.! Wash thyself! N.N.! Wash thyself!'\n\n3. 3 On that (grass) he puts down, with downward-turned hands, ending in the south, the lumps (of food for the Fathers). To his father he gives his lump with (the words), 'This to thee, father, N.N.!' to the grandfather with (the words), 'This to thee, grandfather, N.N.!' to the great-grandfather with (the words), 'This to thee, great-grandfather, N.N.!' silently a fourth (lump). This (fourth lump) is optional.\n\n4\\. Should he not know the names (of the ancestors), he gives the lump to the\nfather with (the words), 'Svadha to the Fathers who dwell on the earth,' to\nthe grandfather with (the words), 'Svadha to the Fathers who dwell in the\nair,' to the great-grandfather with (the words), 'Svadha to the Fathers who\ndwell in heaven.'\n\n5\\. Then he gives, corresponding to each lump, collyrium and (other) salve and\n(something that represents) a garment.\n\np. 230\n\n6. 6 The collyrium (he gives), saying three times, 'Anoint thy eyes, N.N.! Anoint thy eyes, N.N.!'\n\n7\\. The salve, saying three times, 'Anoint thyself, N.N.! Anoint thyself,\nN.N.!'\n\n8. 8 With (the formula), 'These garments are for you, O Fathers. Do not seize upon anything else that is ours,' he tears off a skirt (of his garment) or a flake of wool and puts that down (for the Fathers), if he is in the first half of his life.\n\n9\\. He tears out some hairs of his body, if in the second half.\n\n10\\. Then he washes the vessel (in which the food was of which he had offered\nthe lumps), and sprinkles (the water with which he has washed it), from right\nto left round (the lumps) with (the Mantra), 'These honey-sweet waters,\nbringing refreshment to children and grandchildren, giving sweet drink and\nambrosia to the Fathers, the divine waters refresh both (the living and the\ndead), these rivers, abounding in water, covered with reeds, with beautiful\nbathing-places; may they flow up to you in yon world!' Then he turns the\nvessel over, crosses his hands so that the left hand becomes right and the\nright hand becomes left, and worships (the Fathers) with the formulas of\nadoration, 'Adoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of sap' (Taitt. Sa _m_\nh. III, 2, 5, 5).\n\n11\\. Then he goes to the brink of some water and pours down three handfuls of\nwater (with the following Mantras):\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[229:3](sbe30084.htm#fr_681) According to the commentary after each formula\nthe words are added, 'and to those who follow thee;' comp.
