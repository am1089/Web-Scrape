When they had conquered, they said, \'How may this\n(celestial region) be made unattainable by men?\' They then sipped the sap of\nthe sacrifice, as bees would suck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice\nand effaced the traces of it with the (sacrificial) post 2, they\n\np. 161\n\nconcealed themselves: and because they effaced (ayopayan, viz. the sacrifice)\nwith it, therefore it is called yupa (sacrificial post). Now this was heard by\nthe _Ri_ shis:\n\n1:6:2:22\\. \'Verily, by means of the sacrifice the gods gained this conquest.\nWhen they had conquered, they said, "How may this (celestial region) be made\nunattainable by men?" They then sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees would\nsuck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and effaced the traces of it\nwith the (sacrificial) post, they concealed themselves.\' They (the _Ri_ shis)\nthereupon set about searching for it.\n\n1:6:2:33\\. They went on praising and toiling; for by (religious) toil, the\ngods indeed gained what they wished to gain, and (so did) the _Ri_ shis. Now\nwhether it be that the gods caused it (the sacrifice) to attract (or, peep\nforth to) them, or whether they took to it of their own accord, they said,\n\'Come, let us go to the place whence the gods obtained possession of the world\nof heaven!\' They went about saying (to one another), \'What attracts? What\nattracts 1?\' and came upon the sacrificial cake which had become a tortoise\nand was creeping about. Then they all thought, \'This surely must be the\nsacrifice!\'\n\n1:6:2:44\\. They said, \'Stand still for the A _s_ vins! stand still for\nSarasvati! stand still for Indra!\' still it\n\np. 162\n\ncrept on;--\'Stand still for Agni!\' at this it stopped. Having then enveloped\nit in fire (Agni), knowing, as they did, that it had stopped for Agni, they\nOffered it up entirely, for it was an oblation to the gods. Then the sacrifice\npleased them 1; they produced it, they spread it. And this same sacrifice is\ntaught by the former to the later; the father (teaches it) to his son when he\nis a student (brahma _k_ arin).\n\n1:6:2:55\\. Now that (cake), which caused the sacrifice to attract (or, appear\nto) them, first (puras) bestowed (da _s_ ) it upon them: hence it is (called)\npuroda _s_ a, for puroda _s_ a, doubtless, is the same as puroda _s_ a 2. This\nsame cake on eight potsherds for Agni is indispensable on both occasions (at\nthe new- and full-moon ceremonies).\n\n1:6:2:66\\. That (cake for Agni) does not constitute the (special) sacrificial\nfood (havis) either at the full-moon, or at the new-moon, sacrifice; since the\none for Agni and Soma constitutes the havis at the full-moon, and the Sannayya\n3 at the new-moon sacrifice. That one (for Agni) constitutes rather the\nregular (or, corresponding) sacrifice on both occasions, and because of its\nfearing lest it should become detached from the sacrifice, it is offered up at\nthe beginning of both the full-moon and the new-moon sacrifice: this is the\nreason why it is offered at this particular time.\n\np. 163\n\n1:6:2:77\\. And if any one (householder) were to resort to him (the Adhvaryu)\nand say, \'Perform an ish _t_ i for me!\' let him perform it. Whatever desire\nthe _Ri_ shis entertained when they performed that sacrifice, that desire of\ntheirs was accomplished; and accordingly whatever desire he (the sacrificer)\nentertains in having this sacrifice performed, that desire of his is\naccomplished. For whatever deity sacrificial food is taken, to that deity they\noffer it up in the fire (Agni);--and if he is about to offer it up in the\nfire, why should he announce it to another deity? To Agni alone therefore (it\nis announced).\n\n1:6:2:88\\. Agni (the fire), assuredly, represents all the deities, since it is\nin the fire that they make offering to all deities: to Agni alone therefore\n(he should announce it), since he thereby has recourse to all the deities.\n\n1:6:2:99\\. Agni, assuredly, is the safest 1 among the gods: let him then have\nrecourse to him whom he considers the safest among the gods, and therefore\n(announce the sacrifice) to Agni.\n\n1:6:2:1010\\. Agni, assuredly, is the most tender-hearted of gods: let him then\nhave recourse to him whom he considers the most tender-hearted of gods, and\ntherefore (announce the sacrifice) to Agni.\n\n1:6:2:1111\\. Agni, assuredly, is the nearest of the gods: let him then have\nrecourse to him whom he considers as the nearest of those to be approached,\nand therefore (let him announce the sacrifice) to Agni.\n\n1:6:2:1212\\. If (beside the full-moon sacrifice) he perform an ish _t_ i (with\na view to the accomplishment of some\n\np. 164\n\nspecial desire) [1](sbe1228.htm#fn_380), let him recite seventeen kindling\nverses; (and in that case) he utters the offering-prayer (ya _g_ ya) in a low\nvoice, for this is the characteristic form of an ish _t_ i; the ya _g_ ya and\nthe anuvakya should contain the word \'head [2](sbe1228.htm#fn_381);\' the two\nbutter-portions should be offered to the V _ri_ tra-slayer (Indra); and the\ntwo sa _m_ ya _g_ yas [3](sbe1228.htm#fn_382) should be in the vira _g_ metre.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[160:1](sbe1226.htm#fr_376) Because he (? as lord of creatures) represents all\nthe deities, and one cannot say \'he is such or such a one,\' Saya _n_ a. Cf.\nalso I, 1, 1, 12.\n\n[160:2](sbe1227.htm#fr_377) Yupena yopayitva, literally \'having made it level\nby means of the yupa,\' = yupena _k_ _kh_ adya, \'having covered it over with\nthe yupa,\' Saya _n_ a (cf. also on Rig-veda I, 104, 4). For other versions of\nthe same myth, cf. Ait. Br. II, 1 [\'they debarred them (ayopayan, viz. the men\nand _Ri_ shis from the sacrificial knowledge) by means of the yupa,\' Haug];\nTaitt. S. VI, 3, 4, 7; 5, 3, 1. p. 161 The legend is intended to supply, by\nmeans of a fanciful etymology, a symbolical meaning for the yupa or\nsacrificial post to which the victim is tied.\n\n[161:1](sbe1227.htm#fr_378) Kim praro _k_ ate = \'what thinkest thou?\' Saya _n_\na. The primary meaning of pra-ru _k_ is \'to shine forth.\' Here it has\napparently to be taken in the double sense of \'to peep forth, to appear,\' and\n\'to please.\' The German \'einleuchten\' (St. Petersburg Dictionary) approaches\nmore nearly to the original.\n\n[162:1](sbe1227.htm#fr_379) Or \'appeared to them, shone forth to them,\' praro\n_k_ ata; see preceding note.\n\n[162:2](sbe1227.htm#fr_380) In the compound puro _d_ asa or puro _d_ a _s_ the\noriginal dental d has been changed to the lingual _d_ , apparently through the\ninfluence of the preceding r.\n\n[162:3](sbe1227.htm#fr_381) See I, 6, 4, 9. One would expect the Sannayya (to\nIndra) or the cake to Indra-Agni. The full-moon offering is sacred to Agni-\nSoma: and the new-moon offering to Indra-Agni; see I, 8, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[163:1](sbe1227.htm#fr_382) Addhatamam, adv., literally \'most surely;\'\naccording to Saya _n_ a = ati _s_ ayena pratyakshaphaladam, \'pre-eminently a\ngiver of perceptible benefits.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 6, 3.
