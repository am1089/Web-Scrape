Instead of advancing the story it goes back to Canto XVII.\ncontaining a lamentation of Sita after Ravan has left her, and describes the\nthe auspicious signs sent to cheer her, the throbbing of her left eye, arm,\nand side. The Canto is found in the Bengal recension. Gorresio translates it.\nand observes: "I think that Chapter XXVIII.--The Auspicious Signs--is an\naddition, a later interpolation by the Rhapsodists. It has no bond of\nconnexion either with what precedes or follows it, and may be struck out not\nonly without injury to, but positively to the advantage of the poem. The metre\nin which this chapter is written differs from that which is generally adopted\nin the course of the poem.\'\n\n[411:1b](ry370.htm#fr_852) The guards are still in the grove, but they are\nasleep; and Sita has crept to a tree at some distance from them.\n\n[411:2b](ry370.htm#fr_853) "As the reason assigned in these passages for not\naddressing Sita in Sanskrit such as a Brahman would use is not that she would\nnot understand it, but that it would alarm her and be unsuitable to the\nspeaker, we must take them as indicating that Sanskrit, if not spoken by women\nof the upper classes at the time when the Ramayana was written (whenever that\nmay have been), was at least understood by them, and was commonly spoken by\nmen of the priestly class, and other educated persons, By the Sanskrit proper\nto p. 412 an [ordinary\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXI.: Hanuman\'s Speech.](ry371.htm)\n\n'
