If it be said that between (Brahman and the elements) the intellect and\nmind (are mentioned; and that therefore their origination and retractation are\nto be placed) somewhere in the series, on account of there being inferential\nsigns (whereby the order of the creation of the elements is broken); we\n\np. 27\n\ndeny that, on account of the non-difference (of the organs and the elements).\n\nIn what precedes we have said that the creation and the retractation of the\nelements take place in direct and reverse order; further that the creation\nproceeds from the Self, and that the retractation terminates in the Self.--Now\n_S_ ruti as well as Sm _ri_ ti enlightens us concerning the existence of the\nmind (manas) together with the senses, and of the intellect (buddhi); compare,\nfor instance, the indicatory marks contained in the passage, Ka. Up. I, 3,\n3.4, 'Know the intellect to be the charioteer and the mind the reins; the\nsenses they call the horses,' &c. And as the whole aggregate of beings\navowedly springs from Brahman, we must assume that the mind, the intellect and\nthe senses also originate from it and are again merged in it in due order,\noccupying a definite place among the things created and retracted. Moreover\nthe \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a (Mu _n_ _d_ aka), in the chapter treating of the creation,\nmentions the organs between the Self and the elements, 'From him is born\nbreath, mind and all organs of sense, ether, air, light, water and the earth\nthe support of all' (II, 1, 3). And from this there results a break in the\npreviously stated order of the creation and the retractation of the elements.\n\nThis we deny, on account of the non-difference (of the organs from the\nelements). If the organs themselves are of the nature of the elements, their\norigination and retractation are the same as those of the elements, and we\ntherefore have not to look out in their case for a different order. And that\nthe organs are of the nature of the elements, for that we have inferential\nmarks, in passages such as the following, 'for mind, my child, consists of\nearth, breath of water, speech of fire' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 6, 5). That the organs\n(although in reality belonging to the elements) are sometimes mentioned\nseparately from them, is to be understood in the same way as when the Parivra\n_g_ akas (mendicant Brahma _n_ as) are spoken of separately from the Brahma\n_n_ as. And supposing even that the organs are not of the nature of the\nelements, still the order of the origin of the elements\n\np. 28\n\nwould not be interfered with by the organs; for we might assume either that\nthe organs are produced first and the elements last; or else that the elements\nare produced first and the organs last. In the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a-upanishad quoted\nabove we have merely a serial enumeration of the organs and the elements, not\na statement as to the order of their origination. Similarly in other places\nalso the series of the organs is recorded apart from the series of the\nelements; so, for instance, in the following passage, 'Pra _g_ apati indeed\nwas all this in the beginning, he reflected on himself; he sent forth mind;\nthere was mind only; mind reflected on itself; it sent forth speech,' &c.--\nHence the origination of the organs does not cause a break in the order of the\norigination of the elements.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 16](sbe38017.htm)\n\n"
