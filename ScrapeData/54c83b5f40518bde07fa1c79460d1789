Naraya _n_ a said :-- Now the Seventh Manu is the Right Hon'ble His\nExcellency the Lord Vaivasvata Manu S'raddha Deva, honoured by all the kings,\nand the Enjoyer of the Highest Bliss, Brahmanan _d_ a. I will now speak of\nthis seventh Manu. He, too, practised austerities before the Highest Devi and\nby Her Grace, got the sovereignty of the earth for one Manvantara.\n\n\n\nThe Eighth Manu is the Sun's son, known as Savar _n_ i. This personage, a\ndevotee of the Devi, honoured by the kings, gentle, patient and powerful king\nSavar _n_ i worshipped the Devi in his previous births and, by Her boon,\nbecame the Lord of the Manvantara.\n\n\n\n5\\. Narada said :-- O Bhagavan! How did this Savar _n_ i Manu worship in his\nprevious birth the earthen image of the Devi. Kindly describe this to me.\n\n\n\n6-13. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! This Eighth Manu had been, before, in\nthe time of Svarochi _s_ a Manu (the second Manu), a famous king, known by the\nname of Suratha, born of the family of Chaitra, and very powerful. He could\nwell appreciate merits, clever in the science of archery, amassed abundance of\nwealth, a generous donor, a very liberal man and he was a celebrated poet and\nhonoured by all. He was skilled in all arts of warfare with weapons and\nindomitable in crushing his foes. Once on a time, some of his powerful enemies\ndestroyed the city of Kola, belonging to the revered king and succeeded in\nbesieging his capital wherein he remained. Then the king Suratha, the\nconqueror of all his foes went out to fight with the enemies but he was\ndefeated by them. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the king's ministers\nrobbed him of all his wealth. The illustrious king then went out of the city\nand with a sorrowful heart rode alone on his horse on the plea of having a\ngame and walked to and fro, as if, absent-minded.\n\n\n\n14-25. The king, then, went to the hermitage of the Muni Sumedha, who could\nsee far-reaching things (a Man of the Fourth Dimension). It was a nice, quiet\n\xc3\x82s'rama, surrounded by quiet and peaceful animals and filled with disciples.\nThere in that very sacred \xc3\x82s'rama, his heart became relieved and he went on\nliving there.\n\n\n\nOne day, when the Muni finished his worship, etc., the king went to him and\nsaluted him duly and humbly asked him the following :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! I am\nsuffering terribly from my mental pain. O Deva on the earth! Why I am\nsuffering so much though I know everything, as if I am quite an ignorant man.\nAfter my defeat from my enemies, why does my mind become now\n\n\n\np. 1038\n\n\n\ncompassionate towards those who stole away my kingdom. O Best of the knowers\nof the Vedas! What am I to do now? Where to go? How can I make me happy?\nPlease speak on these. O Muni! Now I am in want of your good grace.\xc2\x94 The Muni\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O Lord of the earth! Hear the extremely wonderful glories of the\nDevi that have no equal and that can fructify all desires. She, the Maha Maya,\nWho is all this world, is the Mother of Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes'a. O King!\nKnow verily that it is She and She alone, that can forcibly attract the hearts\nof all the Jivas and throw them in dire utter delusion. She is always the\nCreatrix, Preservrix and Destructrix of the Universe in the form of Hara. This\nMaha Maya fulfills the desires of all the Jivas and She is known as the\ninsurmountable Kalaratri. She is Kali, the Destructrix of all this universe\nand She is Kamala residing in the lotus. Know that this whole world rests on\nHer and it will become dissolved in Her. She is therefore, the Highest and\nBest. O King! Know, verily, that he alone can cross the delusion (Moha) on\nwhom the Grace of the Devi falls and otherwise no one can escape from this\nAnadi Moha.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Tenth Chapter of the Tenth Book on the anecdote of the King\nSuratha in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 11](bk10ch11.htm)\n\n"
