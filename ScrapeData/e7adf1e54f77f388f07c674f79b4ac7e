I do not wish to enter here\ninto a fuller discussion of Ramanu _g_ a's work in either of these aspects; an\nadequate treatment of them would, moreover, require considerably more space\nthan is at my disposal. Some very useful material for the right understanding\nof Ramanu _g_ u's work is to be found in the 'Analytical Outline of Contents'\nwhich Messrs. M. Ra _n_ ga _k_ arya and M. B. Varadara _g_ a Aiya _n_ gar have\nprefixed to the first volume of their scholarly translation of the Sribhashya\n(Madras, 1899).\n\nThe question as to what the Sturas really teach is a critical, not a\nphilosophical one. This distinction seems to have been imperfectly realised by\nseveral of those critics, writing in India, who have examined the views\nexpressed in my Introduction to the translation of _S_ a _n_ kara's\nCommentary. A writer should not be taxed with 'philosophic incompetency,'\n'hopeless theistic bias due to early training,' and the like, simply because\nhe, on the basis of a purely critical investigation, considers himself\nentitled to maintain that a certain ancient document sets forth one\nphilosophical view rather than another. I have nowhere expressed an opinion as\nto the comparative philosophical value of the systems of _S_ a _n_ kara and\nRamanu _g_ a; not because I have no definite opinions on this point, but\nbecause to introduce them into a critical enquiry would be purposeless if not\nobjectionable.\n\nThe question as to the true meaning of the Sutras is\n\np. x\n\nno doubt of some interest; although the interest of problems of this kind may\neasily be over-estimated. Among the remarks of critics on my treatment of this\nproblem I have found little of solid value. The main arguments which I have\nset forth, not so much in favour of the adequacy of Ramanu _g_ a's\ninterpretation, as against the validity of Sa _n_ kara _k_ arya's\nunderstanding of the Sutras, appear to me not to have been touched. I do not\nby any means consider the problem a hopeless one; but its solution will not be\nadvanced, in any direction, but by those who will be at the trouble of\nsubmitting the entire body of the Sutras to a new and detailed investigation,\navailing themselves to the full of the help that is to be derived from the\nstudy of all the existing Commentaries.\n\nThe present translation of the _S_ ribhashya claims to be faithful on the\nwhole, although I must acknowledge that I have aimed rather at making it\nintelligible and, in a certain sense, readable than scrupulously accurate. If\nI had to rewrite it, I should feel inclined to go even further in the same\ndirection. Indian Philosophy would, in my opinion, be more readily and widely\nappreciated than it is at present, if the translators of philosophical works\nhad been somewhat more concerned to throw their versions into a form less\nstrange and repellent to the western reader than literal renderings from\ntechnical Sanskrit must needs be in many passages. I am not unaware of the\npeculiar dangers of the plan now advocated--among which the most obvious is\nthe temptation it offers to the translator of deviating from the text more\nwidely than regard for clearness would absolutely require. And I am conscious\nof having failed in this respect in more than one instance. In other cases I\nhave no doubt gone astray through an imperfect understanding of the author's\nmeaning. The fact is, that as yet the time has hardly come for fully adequate\ntranslations of comprehensive works of the type of the _S_ ribhashya, the\nauthors of which wrote with reference--in many cases tacit--to an immense and\nhighly technical philosophical literature which is only just beginning to be\nstudied, and comprehended in part, by European scholars.\n\np. xi\n\nIt gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the help which I have received from\nvarious quarters in preparing this translation. Pa _nd_ it Ga _n_ gadhara _S_\nastrin, C. I. E., of the Benares Sanskrit College, has, with unwearying\nkindness and patience, supplied me throughout with comments of his own on\ndifficult sections of the text. Pa _nd_ it Svamin Rama Misra _S_ astrin has\nrendered me frequent assistance in the earlier portion of my task. And to Mr.\nA. Venis, the learned Principal of the Benares Sanskrit College, I am indebted\nfor most instructive notes on some passages of a peculiarly technical and\nabstruse character. Nor can I conclude without expressing my sense of\nobligation to Colonel G. A. Jacob, whose invaluable 'Concordance to the\nPrincipal Upanishads' lightens to an incalculable degree the task of any\nscholar who is engaged in work bearing on the Vedanta.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: First Pada](sbe48003.htm)\n\n"
