He was the Indian Bacchus. Not only are all\nthe hymns of the ninth book of the Rig-Veda, one hundred and fourteen in\nnumber, besides a few in other places, dedicated to his honour, but constant\nreferences occur to him in a large proportion of other hymns. \xe2\x80\xa0 In some of\nthese hymns he is extolled as the Creator, or Father of the gods. Evidently at\nthat time he was a most popular deity. Indra, as was stated before, was an\nenthusiastic worshipper of Soma.\n\nThe following lines will show the warmth of feeling that was cherished towards\nhim:--\n\np. 70\n\n"This Soma is a god; he cures  \n The sharpest ills that man endures.  \n He heals the sick, the sad he cheers,  \n He nerves the weak, dispels their fears;\n\n[![THE SOMA-PLANT.](tn/07000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/07000.jpg)  \nTHE SOMA-PLANT.  \n\nThe faint with martial ardour fires,  \nWith lofty thoughts the bard inspires;  \nThe soul from earth to heaven he lifts;  \nSo great and wondrous are his gifts,  \nMen feel the god within their veins,  \nAnd cry in loud exulting strains:\n\np. 71\n\n\'We\'ve quaffed the Soma bright  \nAnd are immortal grown:  \nWe\'ve entered into light,  \nAnd all the gods have known.  \nWhat mortal now can harm,  \nOr foeman vex us more?  \nThrough thee, beyond alarm,  \nImmortal god, we soar.\'" *\n\nFrom the Vedas the following account of Soma is derived. \xe2\x80\xa0 In some passages\nthe plant is said to have been brought from a mountain and given to Indra; in\nothers, King Soma is said to have dwelt amongst the Gandharvas, a race of\ndemi-gods that form the choir in Indra\'s heaven. The gods, knowing the virtues\nof this king or plant--for the two terms seem to be indiscriminately applied--\nwished to obtain it. Not knowing how to get it, Vach (the goddess of speech)\nsaid, "The Gandharvas are fond of women; let me go, and I will obtain it for\nyou." The gods said, "How can we spare you?" She replied, "Obtain the god; and\nI will then return to you, whenever you may want me." Another account of this\naffair is, that whilst the gods were living on earth, Soma was in the sky.\nWishing to possess it, they sent Gayatri (a name of Brahm\xc4\x81\'s wife or daughter)\nto fetch it. She went in the form of a bird, and was returning with it, when\nthe Gandharvas seized it, and only gave it up when the goddess Vach went\namongst them as narrated above.\n\nWhen Soma was brought to the gods, a dispute arose as to who should have the\nfirst draught. At length, this was decided by a race. V\xc4\x81yu first reached the\ngoal, Indra being second. Indra tried hard to win, and when near the winning\npost proposed that they should reach it together, V\xc4\x81yu taking two-thirds of\nthe drink. V\xc4\x81yu\n\np. 72\n\nsaid, "Not so! I will be the winner alone." Then Indra said, "Let us come in\ntogether, and give me one-fourth of the draught divine!" V\xc4\x81yu consented to\nthis, and so the juice was shared between them. *\n\nSoma is said to have had thirty-three wives, the daughters of Praj\xc4\x81pati; of\nthese Rohini was the favourite. Being dissatisfied with the partiality shown\nto their sister, the other wives returned to their father. Soma asked that\nthey might come back to him; the father consented to restore them, provided\nSoma would treat them all alike. Soma promised to do this; but, failing to\nkeep his promise, he was smitten with consumption for breaking his word.\n\nIn the verses descriptive and songs in praise of Soma, the actual juice, and\nthe god supposed to dwell in and manifested by it, are not at all distinct.\nAll the gods drink of it; and Soma, the god in the juice, is said to clothe\nthe naked and heal the sick. Many divine attributes are ascribed to him. He is\n"addressed as a god in the highest strains of adulation and veneration. All\npowers belong to him; all blessings are besought of him, as his to bestow." He\nis said to be divine, immortal, and also to confer immortality on gods and\nmen. "In a passage where the joys of paradise are more distinctly anticipated\nand more fervently implored than in most other parts of the Rig-Veda, Soma is\naddressed as the god from whom the gift of future felicity is expected. Thus\nit is there said, "Place me, O purified god, in that everlasting and\nimperishable world, where there is eternal light and glory. O Indu (Soma),\nflow for Indra! Make me immortal in the world where Vaivasvata lives, where is\nthe universal sphere of the sky, where those great waters flow." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\np. 73\n\nFrom the hymns addressed to this deity it is evident that at one time it was\nconsidered right for the Hindus to use intoxicants. Now as a rule they are\nforbidden. Amongst the members of one branch of the worshippers of K\xc4\x81li they\nare commonly indulged in, but with almost this single exception, the people do\nnot touch them, and Soma, in his Vedic character has ceased to be worshipped.\n\nIn later years the name Soma was, and still is, given to the moon. How and why\nthis change took place is not known; but in the later of the Vedic hymns there\nis some evidence of the transition. In the following passage Soma seems to he\nused in both senses--as god of the intoxicating juice, and as the moon ruling\nthrough the night. " By Soma the \xc4\x80dityas are strong; by Soma the earth is\ngreat; and Soma is placed in the midst of the stars. When they crush the\nplant, he who drinks regards it as Soma. Of him whom the priests regard as\nSoma (the moon) no one drinks." * In another passage this prayer is found:\n"May the god Soma, he whom they call the Moon, free me." Again, "Soma is the\nmoon, the food of the gods." "The sun has the nature of Agni, the moon of\nSoma."\n\nIn the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0 we read, "Soma was appointed monarch of the stars and\nplants, of Br\xc4\x81hmans and plants, of sacrifices and penance." In this Pur\xc4\x81na we\nhave quite a different account of the origin of Soma; but it must be borne in\nmind that in this account the term refers only to the moon. At the time the\n"Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" was written, intoxicants were strictly forbidden; hence Soma,\nas the god of the intoxicating juice, was no longer known and praised.\nAccording to that Pur\xc4\x81na, \xe2\x80\xa1\n\np. 74\n\n[paragraph continues] Soma was the son of Atri, the son of Brahm\xc4\x81. He\nperformed the R\xc4\x81jasuya sacrifice, and from the glory-thence acquired, and the\nimmense dominion with which he had been invested, became so arrogant and\nlicentious, that he carried off T\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81, the wife of Vrihaspati, the preceptor of\nthe gods. In vain Vrihaspati sought to recover his bride; in vain Brahm\xc4\x81\ncommanded, and the holy sages remonstrated. In consequence of this there was a\ngreat war; the gods fighting with Indra on the one side trying to recover\nT\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81; Soma with the demons on the other. At length she appealed to Brahm\xc4\x81 for\nprotection, who thereupon commanded Soma to restore her. On her return,\nVrihaspati finding she was pregnant, refused to receive her until after the\nbirth of her child. In obedience to his orders, the child was immediately\nborn; who being wonderful in beauty and power, both Vrihaspati and Soma\nclaimed him as their son. T\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81 being referred to, was too much ashamed to\nspeak. The child was so indignant at this, that he was about to curse her,\nsaying, "Unless you declare who is my father, I will sentence you to such a\nfate as shall deter every female from hesitating to speak the truth." On this\nBrahm\xc4\x81 again interfered, pacifying the child, and saying to T\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81, "Tell me, my\nchild, is this the child of Vrihaspati or Soma?" "Of Soma," she said,\nblushing. As soon as she had spoken, the lord of the constellations, his\ncountenance being bright, embraced his son and said, "Well done, my boy;\nverily thou art wise;" and hence his name was Budha. *\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[69:*](hmvp12.htm#fr_69) The Soma-plant of the Rig-Veda is the _Asclepias\nacida_ of Roxburgh. It is a creeping plant, almost destitute of leaves. It has\nsmall white fragrant flowers collected round the extremities of the branches.\nRoxburgh says that it yields purer milky juice than any other plant he knows;\nand that this juice is mild, and of an acid nature. The tender shoots are\noften plucked by native travellers. It grows on hills of the Punjab, in the\nBolan Pass, in the neighbourhood of Poona, etc. In the Br\xc4\x81hmana of the Rig-\nVeda (Haug\'s Translation), is a most interesting account of the Soma\nsacrifice. This is occasionally made in the present day, but very few priests\nare acquainted with the ritual of this once celebrated sacrifice.\n\n[69:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp12.htm#fr_70) Muir, O. S.

The two beings have nothing in common;\nand the names are identical only when one or other of them is misspelt.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IX. Tvastri or Visvakarma](hmvp13.htm)\n\n'
