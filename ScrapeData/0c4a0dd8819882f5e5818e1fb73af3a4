How is the above Bha _s_ ma of three kinds? I am\neager to hear this. Kindly describe this to me. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O\nNarada! I am now talking of the three kinds of ashes; hearing this even\ndestroys one's sins and brings in good fame. When a cow evacuates her dung,\njust as the cow dung leaves her and is far from reaching the ground, one\nshould catch it with one's hand and this cow-dung burnt with \xc2\x93Sadyojatadi,\xc2\x94\ni.e., Brahma Mantra, becomes ashes which are called \xc2\x93S\xc2\x92antika Bha _s_ ma,\xc2\x94\ni.e., ashes producing peace. Before the cowdung is about to reach the ground,\nthe devotee should take it with his hand and uttering the six lettered Mantra,\nhe is to burn the cowdung. The ashes from this are called Pau _st_ ik Bha _s_\nma, i.e., ashes leading to nourishment.\n\n\n\nIf the cowdung be burned with the Mantra \xc2\x93Haum,\xc2\x94 the ashes of this are called\n\xc2\x93Kamada Bha _s_ ma,\xc2\x94 i.e., ashes leading to the granting of desires. O Narada!\nOn the full moon day, new moon day or on the eighth lunar day, a man is to get\nup from his bed early in the morning and be pure and go the cow enclosure. He\nis to salute the cows and take the cowdung, uttering the Mantra Haum. If he be\na Brahmi _n_ , he is to collect the white cow dung; if he be a K _s_ attriya,\nhe would take the red cow\n\n\n\np. 1082\n\n\n\ndung; a Vais'ya, yellow cow dung and if he be a S\xc2\x92udra, he would take the\nblack cow dung. Then by the mantra \xc2\x93Nama _h_ \xc2\x94 he is to form that into a ball\nand cover it with the husk of rice or some other grain and dry it in a sacred\nplace, repeating the mantra \xc2\x93Haum.\xc2\x94 Bring fire from a forest or from the house\nof a Veda-knowing Brahmi _n_ and reduce the cowdung to ashes by this mantra,\nuttering the mantra Haum. Next take out the ashes carefully from the fire\nplace (Agni Ku _nd_ a) and place it in a new jar or pot, again remembering the\nmantra \xc2\x93Haum\xc2\x94. Mix with the ashes the Ketaki dust, the Pa _t_ ala flower dust,\nthe root of the fragrant grass called khas khas, saffron and other sweet\nscented things with the mantra \xc2\x93Satyojatam prapadyami,\xc2\x94 etc. First perform the\nwater bath, then the bath of the ashes. In case one cannot have the water\nbath, one is to have the ash bath. Washing the hands, feet and head with the\nmantra \xc2\x93Is'anah Sarvavidyanam,\xc2\x94 etc., and uttering \xc2\x93Tatpuru _s_ a\xc2\x94 one is to\nbesmear one's face with ashes and by the mantra \xc2\x93Aghora\xc2\x94 apply ashes on one's\nchest; with the mantra Vamadeva. He is to use ashes on his navel; and with the\nmantra \xc2\x93Sadyo Jata,\xc2\x94 etc., all over his body; he is to quit his former cloth\nand put on another fresh cloth. Wash your hands and feet and sip (do \xc3\x82chaman).\nIt will serve the purpose if one simply uses Tripu _nd_ rak and if one does\nnot besmear the whole body with ashes. Before the midday one is to use Bha _s_\nma with water; but after the midday with dry ashes one is to draw the Tripu\n_nd_ ra lines of ashes with the forefinger, middlefinger and ringfinger. The\nhead, forehead, ears, neck, heart, and the arms are the places whereon the\nTripu _nd_ ras are used. On the head the ashes are applied with five fingers\nand with the mantra \xc2\x93Haum\xc2\x94; on the forehead, the Tripu _nd_ ra is applied with\nmantra Svaha by the forefinger, mindlefinger and ringfinger; on the right ear,\nit is applied with \xc2\x93Sadyojata\xc2\x94 mantra; on the left ear, with \xc2\x93Vamadeva\xc2\x94\nMantra; on the neck with Aghora mantra by the middlefinger; on the chest with\n\xc2\x93Nama _h_ \xc2\x94 mantra by the forefing middlefinger and ringfinger; on the right\narm with va _s_ a _t_ mantra by the three fingers; on the left arm with \xc2\x93Ham\xc2\x94\nmantra by the three fingers; and on the navel, the ashes are to be applied\nwith the mantra \xc3\x8es'ana _h_ sarva devanam by the middlefinger. The first line\nin every Tripu _nd_ ra is Brahma; the second line is Vi _sn_ u; and the third,\nthe topmost line is Maha Deva. The line of ashes that is marked by one finger\nis \xc3\x8es'vara. The head is the place of Brahma; the forehead is the site of\n\xc3\x8es'vara; the two ears are the seats of the two As'vins and the neck is where\nGa _n_ es'a resides. The K _s_ attriyas, Vais'yas, and S\xc2\x92udras are to use\nTripu _nd_ ras without any mantra; they are also not to use the ashes on\n\n\n\np. 1083\n\n\n\nthe whole of the body. The lowest classes (e.g. the cha _nd_ alas, etc.,) and\nthe uninitiated persons are to use the Tripu _nd_ raks without any mantra.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eleventh Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the description of the\ngreatness of the three kinds of Bha _s_ mas in the Mahapuranam S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 12](bk11ch12.htm)\n\n"
