When Indra had hurled the thunderbolt at V _ri_ tra, thinking\nhimself to be the weaker, and fearing lest he had not brought him down, he\nconcealed himself and went to the farthest distances 1. Now the gods knew that\nV _ri_ tra had been slain and that Indra had concealed himself.\n\n1:6:4:22\\. Agni of the deities, Hira _n_ yastupa 2 of the _Ri_ shis, and the B\n_ri_ hati of the metres, set about searching for him. Agni discovered him and\nstayed\n\np. 176\n\nwith him (as a guest) that (day and) night. He (Indra), namely, is the Vasu 1\nof the gods, for he is their hero.\n\n1:6:4:33\\. The gods said, 'Our Vasu, who has gone to live away from us, is\nthis day dwelling together (ama vas, viz. with Agni 2);' and as one would cook\na dish of rice or a goat in common for two relatives or friends who have come\nto stay with him,--for such-like is human (fare), as the sacrificial food\n(havis) is that of the gods,--in like manner they offered to those two\ntogether that sacrificial food, the rice-cake on twelve potsherds for Indra\nand Agni. This is the reason why there is a rice-cake on twelve potsherds for\nIndra and Agni.\n\n1:6:4:44\\. Indra said, 'When I had hurled the thunderbolt at V _ri_ tra, I was\nterrified, and (in consequence of this fright) I am much emaciated. This\n(cake) does not satiate me: prepare for me what will satiate me!' The gods\nreplied, 'So be it!'\n\n1:6:4:55\\. The gods said, 'Nothing but Soma will satiate him: let us prepare\nSoma for him!' They prepared Soma for him. Now this king Soma, the food of the\ngods, is no other than the moon 3. When he\n\np. 177\n\n[paragraph continues] (the moon, masc.) is not seen that night either in the\neast or in the west, then he visits this world; and here he enters into the\nwaters (f.) and plants (f.). He is indeed a treasure for the gods, he is their\nfood. And since during that night he here dwells together 1 (ama vas),\ntherefore that (night of new moon) is called amavasya (the dwelling together,\nor at home).\n\n1:6:4:66\\. They prepared it 2 (Soma for Indra), after having it collected,\npart by part, by the cows: in eating plants (they collected it) from the\nplants, and in drinking water (they collected it) from the waters. Having\nprepared and coagulated it, and made it strong (pungent), they gave it to him\n3.\n\n1:6:4:77\\. He said, 'This does indeed satiate me, but it does not agree with\nme 4: devise some means by which it may agree with me!' They made it agree\nwith him by means of boiled (milk).\n\n1:6:4:88\\. Now although this (mixture of sweet and sour milk) is, indeed, one\nand the same substance--it being milk (payas) and belonging to Indra--they,\n\np. 178\n\nnevertheless, declare it to be (two) different (substances). Since he said 'it\nsatiates (dhi) me,' therefore it is sour milk (dadhi); and since they made it\nagree ( _s_ ri) with him with boiled milk (or, by boiling), therefore it is\n(fresh) boiled milk ( _s_ _ri_ ta) 1.\n\n1:6:4:99\\. In the same way as the Soma stalk becomes strong 2 (by being\ntouched or sprinkled with water), so he (Indra) became strong (by the Soma\nbeing mixed with boiled milk) and overcame that evil, the jaundice 3. Such is\nlikewise the significance of the new-moon ceremony (and the Sannayya, or\nlibation of sweet and sour milk offered to Indra thereat); and verily he who,\nknowing this, mixes (sweet and sour milk at the new-moon sacrifice) in like\nmanner increases in offspring and cattle, and overcomes evil: let him\ntherefore mix together (sweet and sour milk) 4.\n\np. 179\n\n1:6:4:1010\\. In reference to this point they say, 'One who has not performed\nthe Soma-sacrifice 1, must not offer the Sannayya; for, indeed, the Sannayya\nis (of the same significance as) a Soma libation, and the latter is not\npermitted to one who is not a Soma-sacrificer: hence he who has not performed\nthe Soma-sacrifice, must not offer the Sannayya.'\n\n1:6:4:1111\\. He may nevertheless offer the Sannayya; for have we not heard\nwithin this place 2 that he (Indra) said, 'Do ye now offer Soma to me, and\nthen ye will prepare for me that invigorating draught (apyayana, viz. the\nSannayya)!' 'This does not satiate me, prepare for me what will satiate me!'\nThat invigorating draught they indeed prepared for\n\np. 180\n\nhim, and therefore even one who has not performed the Soma-sacrifice, may\noffer the Sannayya.\n\n1:6:4:1212\\. The full-moon oblation, assuredly, belongs to the V _ri_ tra-\nslayer, for by means of it Indra slew V _ri_ tra; and this new-moon oblation\nalso represents the slaying of V _ri_ tra, since they prepared that\ninvigorating draught for him who had slain V _ri_ tra.\n\n1:6:4:1313\\. An offering in honour of the V _ri_ tra-slayer, then, is the\nfull-moon sacrifice. V _ri_ tra, assuredly, is no other than the moon 1; and\nwhen during that night (of new moon) he is not seen either in the east or in\nthe west, then he (Indra) completely destroys him by means of that (new-moon\nsacrifice), and leaves nothing remaining of him. And, verily, he who knows\nthis, overcomes all evil and leaves nothing remaining of evil.\n\n1:6:4:1414\\. Here now some people enter upon the fast when they (still) see\n(the moon, on the fourteenth day of the half-month), thinking, 'To-morrow he\nwill not rise: already, then, there is unfailing food for the gods in yonder\nheaven 2, and to this we will offer them more from hence (to-morrow)!'--He,\nindeed, is in a prosperous state with whom, while the old food is still\nunfailing, fresh food is accruing; for such a one has indeed abundant food.\nHowever, he is not now offering Soma, but he is offering milk (i.e. the\nSannayya), and that (milk) becomes king Soma 3 (in yonder world):\n\np. 181\n\n1:6:4:1515\\. But as they (the cows), previously (to the new moon), eat mere\nplants (not imbued with the moon or Soma), and drink mere water, and yield\nmere milk,--so that (milk which they offer on the day before new moon, is not\nimbued with Soma, is ordinary milk). For king Soma, the food of the gods,\nindeed, is no other than the moon. When he is not seen that night either in\nthe east or in the west, then he visits this world, and here enters into the\nwaters and plants. Having then collected him from the water and plants, he\n(the performer of the Sannayya) causes him to be reproduced from out of the\nlibations; and he (Soma, the moon), being reproduced from the libations,\nbecomes visible in the western sky.\n\n1:6:4:1616\\. Now it is only when that food of the gods is unfailing that it\ncomes back (to men): for him, therefore, who knows this, there is unfailing\nfood in this, and imperishable righteousness in yonder, world.\n\n1:6:4:1717\\. Thus during that night (of new moon) food moves away from the\ngods and comes to this world. Now the gods were desirous as to how that (food)\nmight (be made to) come back to them; how it might not perish away from them.\nFor this they put their trust in those who prepare the libation of sweet and\nsour milk (sannayya), thinking, 'when they have prepared it, they will offer\nit to us.' And, verily, in him, who knows this, both his own kin and strangers\nput their trust; for in him, who attains to the highest rank, people indeed\nput their trust.\n\n1:6:4:1818\\. Now the one that burns there (viz. the sun)\n\np. 182\n\nis, assuredly, no other than Indra, and that moon is no other than V _ri_ tra.\nBut the former is of a nature hostile to the latter, and for this reason,\nthough this one (the moon, V _ri_ tra) had previously (to the night of new\nmoon) risen at a great distance from him (the sun, Indra), he now swims\ntowards him and enters into his open mouth.\n\n1:6:4:1919\\. Having swallowed him, he (the sun) rises; and that (other) one is\nnot seen either in the east or in the west. And, verily, he who knows this,\nswallows his spiteful enemy, and of him they say, 'He alone exists, his\nenemies exist not 1.'\n\n1:6:4:2020\\. Having sucked him empty, he throws him out; and the latter, thus\nsucked out, is seen in the western sky, and again increases; he again\nincreases to serve that (sun) as food: and verily if the spiteful enemy of one\nwho knows this, thrives either by trade or in any other way, he thrives again\nand again in order to serve him as food.\n\n1:6:4:2121\\. Now some people offer (the Sannayya) to (Indra under the name of)\n'Mahendra' (the great Indra), arguing, 'Before the slaying of V _ri_ tra he\nwas Indra, it is true; but after slaying V _ri_ tra he became Mahendra, even\nas (a ragan, or king, becomes) a Mahara _g_ a after obtaining the victory:\nhence (the Sannayya should be offered) to Mahendra.' Let him, nevertheless,\noffer it to 'Indra;' for Indra he was before the slaying of V _ri_ tra, and\nIndra he is after slaying V _ri_ tra: therefore let him offer it to 'Indra 2.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[175:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_403) Para _h_ paravata _h_ , literally to the most\ndistant distances, 'zu den fernsten Fernen.'\n\n[175:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_404) Hira _n_ yastupa, of the family of the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, is\nthe reputed author (or seer) of the hymns Rig-veda I, 31-35; IX, 4; 69. Of\nthese, I, 32 and 33, which celebrate the exploits of Indra, seem to have been\nespecially prized.\n\n[176:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_405) That is, as would seem, the benefactor, or the\ntreasure (dhanarupa, Saya _n_ a) of the gods. Indra is the chief of the Vasus.\nIndra being so beneficent and important a personage, it was, according to Saya\n_n_ a, worth Agni's while to stay with him. Possibly also a play on the word\nVasu, and vas, 'to dwell,' is intended here.\n\n[176:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_406) Thus Saya _n_ a; but it probably means, 'he is\nstaying at a home, or at home (ama) to-day.'\n\n[176:3](sbe1229.htm#fr_407) The identification of the Soma (plant and juice)\nwith the moon already occurs in some of the hymns of the Rig-veda, all of\nwhich, however, probably belong to the later ones. According to the St.\nPetersburg Dictionary, the identification was probably suggested by the\ncircumstance that indu, 'drop, spark,' applies both to the Soma and the moon.\nRig-veda X, 85, 3 says that of that Soma which the priests know, no one ever\neats.'\n\n[177:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_408) Viz. with the waters and plants (or, he stays at\nhome).\n\n[177:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_409) It should be borne in mind that Soma is masculine\nin Sanskrit.\n\n[177:3](sbe1229.htm#fr_410) In Taitt. S. II, 5, 3, 2 seq. the corresponding\nstory is applied directly to the Sannayya. In consequence of the struggle with\nV _ri_ tra., Indra lost his energy, which fell to the earth and produced\nplants and shrubs. He thereupon complained to Pra _g_ apati, who bade the\ncattle collect (sam-ni) it again by browsing the plants and shrubs. It was\nthen milked out from them, and as the milk did not agree with Indra, it was\nboiled, and as it still did not satisfy Indra, it was mixed with sour milk.\n\n[177:4](sbe1229.htm#fr_411) Na mayi _s_ rayate, 'literally it does not stay in\nme' = na tish _th_ ati, na satmyam bha _g_ ate, Saya _n_ a. The author here\n(as in I, 8, I, 17) connects, or confounds, the verb _s_ ri with _s_ ra, 'to\ncook, make done,'--hence, 'it does not boil in me;' the milk being warm, or,\nas it were, boiled, when it comes from the cow, see II, 2, 4, 15. Hence also\nboiled milk is mixed with the Soma.\n\n[178:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_412) The author here endeavours to establish some\nconnection between the Sannayya (or offering of sweet and sour milk to Indra,\nwhich may take the place of the second sacrificial cake offered, at the new-\nmoon sacrifice, to Indra and Agni) and the Soma libations. Saya _n_ a refers\nto the passage Taitt. Br. I, 4, 7, 6-7, where it is stated that for the\nmorning libation the Soma is to be mixed with boiled milk, for the mid-day\nlibation with sour milk, and for the third (or evening) libation with sour\nmilk that is partly changed into butter (nitami _s_ ra).\n\n[178:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_413) \xc3\x82pyayeta. On the strengthening or increasing\n(apyayanam) of the Soma-plant by sprinkling it with water before the juice is\nextracted, see III, 4, 3, 12 seq. Saya _n_ a seems to take the passage thus:\n'In the same way as the Soma would make strong (? or become strong), so also\nthe sannayyam destroys that evil, the jaundice, in those who drink it.'\n\n[178:3](sbe1229.htm#fr_414) By the admixture of milk the Soma-juice loses its\nbrownish colour, and is therefore apparently considered to produce the same\neffect in those who drink the mixture.\n\n[178:4](sbe1229.htm#fr_415) The preparation of the sannayya, as it is now\npractised by priests in Western India, is thus described by Haug (Ait. Br. II,\np. 443): p. 179 'The Adhvaryu takes the milk from three cows called Ga\xe1\xb9\x85ga,\nYamuna, and Sarasvati, on the morning and evening, and gives it to the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra. Half the milk is first drawn from the udder of each of the three\ncows under the recital of mantras; then the same is done silently. The milk is\ntaken from these cows on the evening of the new-moon day, and on the morning\nof the following day, the so-called Pratipad (the first day of the month). The\nmilk drawn on the evening is made hot, and lime-juice poured over it to make\nit sour; whereupon it is hung up. The fresh milk of the following morning is\nthen mixed with it, and both are sacrificed along with the Puro _d_ a _s_ a.\nOnly he who has already performed the Agnish _t_ oma is allowed to sacrifice\nthe Sannayya at the Dar _s_ apur _n_ ima ish _t_ i. (Oral information.)' In Va\n_g_. S. I, 4 ( _S_ at. Br. I, 7, 1, 17; Katy. IV, 2, 25, 26) the names of the\nthree cows are given as Vi _s_ vayu, Vi _s_ vakarman, and Vi _s_ vadhayus,\nunless these are intended merely for epithets or mystic names. Cf. [p.\n188](sbe1230.htm#page_188) note; Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 232. Instead of the\nlime-juice, mentioned by Haug as used for rennet, Katy. IV, 2, 33 prescribes\nthat the milk remaining from the Agnihotra of the preceding evening, and since\nbecome sour, should be used.\n\n[179:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_416) Thus Taitt. S. II, 5, 5, 1.\n\n[179:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_417) Atrantare _n_ a; atra vishaye antare _n_ a madhye,\nSaya _n_ a; ? within this our range of hearing; or, in the course of the\npresent ceremony.\n\n[180:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_418) See I, 6, 3, 17.\n\n[180:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_419) Viz. in the form of Soma, i.e. the moon, still\nshining in the heavens during the night preceding the new moon.\n\n[180:3](sbe1229.htm#fr_420) Who, as we saw, resides in the plants and waters\nat the time of new moon and consequently in the milk used for the Sannayya.\nIf, however, one were to enter upon the fast (and hence on the p. 181\nsacrifice) previously to the new moon, he would be offering mere milk, not\nimbued with, and not liable to change into, Soma, and therefore unfit for the\ngods.\n\n[182:1](sbe1229.htm#fr_421) With this explanation of the disappearance of the\nmoon may be compared the later notion of the sun and moon being swallowed by\nthe demon Rahu, at the time of the eclipses.\n\n[182:2](sbe1229.htm#fr_422) Katy. IV, 2, 10 leaves it optional whether the\nlibation of mixed p. 183 sweet and sour milk is to be offered to Indra or to\nMahendra. According to IV, 5, 25, however, such option seems to be permitted\nonly so far as the first performance is concerned, after which one is\napparently bound to go on offering during the rest of one's life to whichever\ndeity one has chosen at the beginning. Taitt. S. II, 5, 4, 4, lays it down as\nthe rule that only a gata _s_ ri (one who has reached the highest grade of\nprosperity), viz. a brahma _n_ a versed in the three Vedas ( _s_ u _s_ ruvan =\nvedatrayabhi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, Saya _n_ a, the head of a village (grama _n_ i), and a\nra _g_ anya, can make offering to Mahendra, since he is their special deity.\nOthers, however, may do the same, after offering the sannayyam to Indra for a\nwhole year, and on the expiration of it a rice-cake on eight potsherds to\nAgni, as the Keeper of Vows.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 7, 1.
