It is of the quality of goodness, of the quality of passion, and of the\nquality of darkness. Hear about it. The faith of all, O descendant of Bharata!\nis conformable to the\n\np. 118\n\nheart 1. A being here is full of faith, and whatever is a man\'s faith, that is\na man himself 2. Those of the quality of goodness worship the gods; those of\nthe quality of passion the Yakshas and Rakshases 3; and the others, the people\nof the quality of darkness, worship departed (spirits) and the multitudes of\nBhutas. Know those to be of demoniac convictions, who practise fierce penance\n4 not ordained by scripture; who are full of ostentatiousness and egoism, and\nof desire, attachment, and stubbornness; who are without discernment; and who\ntorment the groups of organs in (their) bodies, and me also seated within\n(those) bodies. The food also, which is liked by all, and likewise the\nsacrifice, the penance, and gifts, are of three kinds. Listen to the\ndistinctions regarding them as follows. The kinds of food which increase life,\nenergy, strength, health, comfort, and relish, which are savoury, oleaginous,\nfull of nutrition, and agreeable, are liked by the good. The kinds of food\nwhich are bitter, acid, saltish, too hot, sharp, rough, and. burning, and\nwhich cause pain. grief, and disease, are desired by the passionate. And the\nfood 5 which is cold, tasteless, stinking, stale, impure, and even leavings,\nare liked by the dark. That sacrifice is good which, being prescribed in\n(scripture) ordinances, is performed by persons\n\np. 119\n\nnot wishing for the fruit (of it), and after determining (in their) mind that\nthe sacrifice must needs be performed. But when a sacrifice is performed, O\nhighest of the descendants of Bharata! with an expectation of fruit (from it),\nand for the purpose of ostentation, know that sacrifice (to be) passionate.\nThey call that sacrifice dark, which is against the ordinances (of scripture),\nin which no food is dealt out (to Brahma _n_ as, &c.), which is devoid of\nMantras 1, devoid of Dakshi _n_ a presents, and which is without faith. Paying\nreverence to gods, Brahma _n_ as, preceptors, and men of knowledge; purity 2,\nstraightforwardness, life as Brahma _k_ arin, and harmlessness, (this) is\ncalled the penance bodily. The speech which causes no sorrow, which is true,\nagreeable, and beneficial, and the study 3 of the Vedas, (this) is called the\npenance vocal. Calmness of mind, mildness, taciturnity 4, self-restraint, and\npurity of heart, this is called the penance mental. This threefold penance,\npractised with perfect faith, by men who do not wish for the fruit, and who\nare possessed of devotion is called good. The penance which is done for\nrespect, honour, and reverence 5, and with ostentatiousness,\n\np. 120\n\nand which is uncertain and transient 1, is here called passionate. And that\npenance is described as dark, which is performed under a misguided conviction,\nwith pain to oneself, or for the destruction of another. That gift is said (to\nbe) good, which is given, because it ought to be given, to one who (can) do no\nservice (in return), at a (proper) place and time, an d to a (proper) person.\nBut that gift which is given with much difficulty, for a return of services,\nor even with an expectation of fruit 2, is said to be passionate. And that\ngift, is described as dark, which is given to unfit persons, at an unfit place\nand time, without respect, and with contempt. Om, Tad, and Sat, this is said\n(to be) the threefold designation of the Brahman. By that 3, the Brahma _n_ as\nand the Vedas and sacrifices were created in olden times. Hence, the\nperformance by those who study the Brahman, of sacrifices, gifts, and\npenances, prescribed by the ordinances (of scripture), always commence after\nsaying \'Om 4.\' Those who desire final emancipation perform the various acts of\nsacrifice and penance, and the various acts of gift, without expectation of\nfruit, after (saying) \'Tad 5.\' \'Sat\' is employed to express existence and\ngoodness; and likewise, O son of P _ri_ tha! the word \'Sat\' is used to express\nan auspicious act. Constancy in\n\np. 121\n\n(making) sacrifices. penances, and gifts, is called \'Sat;\' and (all) action,\ntoo, of which that [1](sbe0820.htm#fn_520) is the object, is also called\n\'Sat.\' Whatever oblation is offered, whatever is given, whatever penance is\nperformed, and whatever is done, without faith [2](sbe0820.htm#fn_521), that,\nO son of P _ri_ tha! is called \'Asat,\' and that is nought, both after death\nand here [3](sbe0820.htm#fn_522).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[117:1](sbe0818.htm#fr_504) I. e. rendering the self unfit for any of the\nhighest ends of man.\n\n[117:2](sbe0818.htm#fr_505) Here, says _S_ ridhara, it is laid down that the\ntriad is not to be got rid of save by following scripture rules.\n\n[117:3](sbe0818.htm#fr_506) I. e. fitness for the attainment of the summum\nbonum.
