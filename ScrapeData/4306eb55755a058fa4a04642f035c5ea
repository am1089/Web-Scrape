 \nMen joy to see the sun arise,  \nThey watch him set with joyful eyes:  \nBut ne\'er reflect, too blind to see,  \nHow fast their own brief moments flee.  \nWith lovely change for ever new  \nThe seasons\' sweet return they view,  \nNor think with heedless hearts the while  \nThat lives decay as seasons smile.  \nAs haply on the boundless main  \nMeet drifting logs and part again.  \nSo wives and children, friends and gold,  \nOures for a little time we hold:  \nSoon by resistless laws of fate  \nTo meet no more we separate.  \nIn all this changing world not one  \nThe common lot of all can shun:  \nThen why with useless tears deplore  \nThe dead whom tears can bring no more?  \nAs one might stand upon the way  \nAnd to a troop of travellers say:  \n\'If ye allow it, sirs, I too  \nWill travel on the road with you:\'  \nSo why should mortal man lament  \nWhen on that path his feet are bent  \nWhich all men living needs must tread,  \nWhere sire and ancestors have led?  \nLife flies as torrents downward fall  \nSpeeding away without recall,  \nSo virtue should our thoughts engage,  \nFor bliss  1b is mortals\' heritage,  \n\np. 215  \n\nBy ceaseless care and earnest zeal  \nFor servants and for people\'s weal,  \nBy gifts, by duty nobly done,  \nOur glorious sire the skies has won.  \nOur lord the king, o\'er earth who reigned,  \nA blissful home in heaven has gained  \nBy wealth in ample largess spent,  \nAnd many a rite magnificent:  \nWith constant joy from first to last  \nA long and noble life he passed,  \nPraised by the good, no tears should dim  \nOur eyes, O brother dear, for him.  \nHis human body, worn and tried  \nBy length of days, he cast aside,  \nAnd gained the godlike bliss to stray  \nIn Brahma\'s heavenly home for aye.  \n"For such the wise as we are, deep  \nIn Veda lore, should never weep.  \nThose who are firm and ever wise  \nSpurn vain lament and idle sighs.  \nBe self-possessed: thy grief restrain:  \nGo, in that city dwell again.  \nReturn, O best of men, and be  \nObedient to our sire\'s decree,  \nWhile I with every care fulfil  \nOur holy father\'s righteous will,  \nObserving in the lonely wood  \nHis charge approved by all the good,\'  \n\n   Thus Rama of the lofty mind  \n     To Bharat spoke his righteous speech,  \n   By every argument designed  \n     Obedience to his sire to teach,  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[214:1](ry183.htm#fr_381) Garud, the king of birds.\n\n[214:1b](ry183.htm#fr_382) To be won by virtue.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto CVI.: Bharat\'s Speech.](ry184.htm)\n\n'
