Having taken up both (the Garhapatya and \xc3\x82havaniya) fires on the\ntwo kindling-sticks 1, he goes to the house of the Commander of the army, and\nprepares a cake on eight potsherds for Agni Anikavat; for Agni is the head\n(anika) of the gods, and the commander is the head of the army: hence for Agni\nAnikavat. And he, the commander, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels\n2: it is for\n\np. 59\n\nhim that he is thereby consecrated (or quickened), and him he makes his own\nfaithful (follower). The sacrificial fee for this (jewel-offering) consists in\ngold; for Agni's is that sacrifice, and gold is Agni's seed: therefore the\nsacrificial fee consists in gold.\n\n5:3:1:22\\. And on the following day, he goes to the house of the Purohita (the\nking's court chaplain), and prepares a pap for B _ri_ haspati; for B _ri_\nhaspati is the Purohita of the gods, and that (court chaplain) is the Purohita\n('praepositus') of that (king): hence it is for B _ri_ haspati. And he, the\nPurohita, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he\nis thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The\nsacrificial fee for this is a white-backed bullock; for to B _ri_ haspati\nbelongs that upper region, and there above lies that path of Aryaman (the sun)\n1: therefore the fee for the Barhaspatya (oblation) is a white-backed\n(bullock).\n\n5:3:1:33\\. And on the following day he prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for\nIndra at the dwelling of him who is being consecrated (the king); for Indra is\nthe Kshatra (ruling power), and he who is consecrated is\n\np. 60\n\nthe Kshatra: hence it is for Indra. The sacrificial fee for this is a bull,\nfor the bull is Indra's own (animal).\n\n5:3:1:44\\. And on the following day, he goes to the dwelling of the Queen, and\nprepares a pap for Aditi; for Aditi is this Earth, and she is the wife of the\ngods; and that (queen) is the wife of that (king): hence it is for Aditi. And\nshe, the Queen, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for her\nthat he is thereby consecrated, and he makes her his own faithful (wife). The\nsacrificial fee, on her part, is a milch cow; for this (earth) is, as it were,\na milch cow: she yields to men all their desires; and the milch cow is a\nmother, and this (earth) is, as it were, a mother: she bears (or sustains)\nmen. Hence the fee is a milch cow.\n\n5:3:1:55\\. And on the following day, he goes to the house of the Suta (court-\nminstrel and chronicler), and prepares a barley pap for Varu _n_ a; for the\nSuta is a spiriter (sava), and Varu _n_ a is the spiriter of the gods:\ntherefore it is for Varu _n_ a. And he, the Suta, assuredly is one of his (the\nking's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated; and him he makes\nhis own faithful (follower). The sacrificial fee for this one is a horse, for\nthe horse is Varu _n_ a's own.\n\n5:3:1:66\\. And on the following day, he goes to the house of the Headman\n(Grama _n_ i 1), and prepares a cake\n\np. 61\n\non seven potsherds for the Maruts; for the Maruts are the peasants, and the\nheadman is a peasant: therefore it is for the Maruts. And he, the headman,\nassuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby\nconsecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee\nfor this (jewel) is a spotted bullock, for in such a spotted bullock there is\nabundance of colours; and the Maruts are the clans (or peasants), and the clan\nmeans abundance; therefore the sacrificial fee is a spotted bullock.\n\n5:3:1:77\\. And on the following day he goes to the house of the Chamberlain\n(kshatt _ri_ ), and prepares a cake on either twelve, or eight, potsherds for\nSavit _ri_ ; for Savit _ri_ is the impeller (prasavit _ri_ ) of the gods, and\nthe chamberlain is an impeller: hence it is for Savit _ri_. And he, the\nchamberlain, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that\nhe thereby is consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful (follower). The\nsacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a reddish-white draught-bullock; for Savit\n_ri_ is he that burns yonder, and he (the sun) indeed moves along; and the\ndraught-bullock also moves along, when yoked. And as to why it is a reddish-\nwhite one;--reddish-white indeed is he (the sun) both in rising and in\nsetting: therefore the sacrificial fee is a reddish-white draught-bullock.\n\n5:3:1:88\\. And on the following day he goes to the house\n\np. 62\n\nof the Charioteer (sa _m_ grahit _ri_ ), and prepares a cake on two potsherds\nfor the A _s_ vins; for the two A _s_ vins are of the same womb; and so are\nthe chariot fighter 1 and the driver (sarathi) of the same womb (standing-\nplace), since they stand on one and the same chariot: hence it is for the A\n_s_ vins. And he, the charioteer, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels:\nit is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own\nfaithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a pair of twin\nbullocks, for such twin bullocks are of the same womb. If he cannot obtain\ntwins, two bullocks produced by successive births (of the same cow) may also\nform the sacrificial fee, for such also are of the same womb.\n\n5:3:1:99\\. And on the following day he goes to the house\n\np. 63\n\nof the Carver (bhagadugha 1), and prepares a pap for Pushan, for Pushan is\ncarver to the gods; and that (officer) is carver to that (king): therefore it\nis for Pushan. And he, the carver, assuredly is one of his (the king's)\njewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own\nfaithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a dark-grey\nbullock: the significance of such a one being the same as at the Trisha _m_\nyukta 2.\n\n5:3:1:1010\\. And on the following day, having brought together gavedhuka\n(seeds) from the houses of the Keeper of the dice (akshavapa 3) and the\nHuntsman (govikartana 4), he prepares a gavedhuka pap for Rudra at the house\nof him who is consecrated. These two, while being two jewels (of the king), he\nmakes one for the purpose of completeness. And as to why he performs this\noffering,--Rudra is hankering after that (cow) which is killed here in this\nhall;\n\np. 64\n\nnow Rudra is Agni (fire), and the gaming-board being fire, and the dice being\nits coals, it is him (Rudra) he thereby pleases. And verily whosoever, that\nknows this thus, performs the Ra _g_ asuya, in his house that approved (cow)\nis killed. And he, the keeper of dice, and the huntsman, are (each of them)\nassuredly one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for these two that he is\nthereby consecrated, and these two he makes his own faithful followers. The\nsacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a bicoloured bullock--either one with\nwhite fore-feet, or a white-tailed one,--a claw-shaped knife, and a dice-board\n1 with a horsehair band 2; for that is what belongs to those two 3.\n\n5:3:1:1111\\. And on the following day he goes to the house of the Courier, and\nhaving taken ghee in four ladlings, he offers the ghee to the way, with, 'May\nthe way graciously accept of the ghee, hail!' For the courier is to be\ndispatched, and when dispatched goes on his way: therefore he offers the ghee\nto the way. And he, the courier, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels:\nit is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own\nfaithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) consists in a skin-\ncovered bow, leathern quivers, and a red turban, for that is what belongs to\nhim.\n\n5:3:1:1212\\. These are the eleven jewels (ratna) he completes; for of eleven\nsyllables consists the Trish _t_ ubh, and the Trish _t_ ubh is vigour: it is\nfor the sake\n\np. 65\n\nof vigour that he completes the (eleven) jewels. Then as to why he performs\nthe oblations of the Ratnins: it is their king he becomes; it is for them that\nhe thereby is consecrated, and it is them he makes his own faithful followers.\n\n5:3:1:1313\\. And on the following day he goes to the house of a discarded\n(wife), and prepares a pap for Nir _ri_ ti;--a discarded wife is one who has\nno son. He cooks the pap for Nir _ri_ ti of black rice, after splitting the\ngrains with his nails. He offers it with (Va _g_. S. IX, 3), 'This, O Nir _ri_\nti, is thy share: accept it graciously, hail!' For a wife that is without a\nson, is possessed with Nir _ri_ ti (destruction, calamity); and whatever of\nNir _ri_ ti's nature there is in her, that he thereby propitiates, and thus\nNir _ri_ ti does not take possession of him while he is consecrated. The fee\nfor this (oblation) consists of a black, decrepit, diseased cow; for such a\none also is possessed with Nir _ri_ ti. He says to her (the wife), 'Let her\nnot dwell this day in my dominion 1! thus he removes evil from himself.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[58:1](sbe4113.htm#fr_126) Each of the two 'ara _n_ is' is held for a moment\nto one of the two fires, which are thereby supposed to become inherent in them\ntill they are 'churned out' again for the new offering fire required. For this\n'mounting' of the fire see part i, p. 396.\n\n[58:2](sbe4113.htm#fr_127) Ratna, jewel, precious thing; whence the eleven\nofferings described in this section are called ratna-havis, or ratnina _m_\nhavi _m_ shi; the recipients of these sacrificial honours, on the part of the\nnewly-consecrated king, being called ratnina _h_ , 'possessed of the Jewel\n(offering).'--In the ritual of the Black Ya _g_ us (Taitt. S. I, 8, 9; Taitt.\nBr. I, 1, 3) the order of the Ratnina _h_ , at whose houses these oblations\nare performed on successive days, is as follows--1. Brahman priest (a pap to B\n_ri_ haspati); 2. Ra _g_ anya (a cake of eleven kapalas to Indra); 3.\nConsecrated Queen (pap to p. 59 Aditi); 4. The king's favourite wife (pap to\nBhaga); 5. A discarded wife (pap to Nir _ri_ ti); 6. Commander of the army\n(cake of eight kap. to Agni); 7. Suta (charioteer, Say.--cake of ten kap. to\nVaru _n_ a); 8. Grama _n_ i (cake of seven kap. to Maruts); 9. Kshatt _ri_\n(chamberlain, or superintendent of seraglio, Say.--cake of twelve kap. to\nSavit _ri_ ); 10. Sa _m_ grahit _ri_ (treasurer, Say.--cake of two kap. to A\n_s_ vins); 11. Bhagadugha (collector of taxes, Say.--pap to Pushan); 12.\nAkshavapa (dyutakara, superintendent of gambling, Say.--gavidhuka pap to\nRudra).--Finally the king offers in his own house two cake-oblations (of\neleven kapalas) to Indra Sutra-man (the good protector) and Indra A _m_ homu\n_k_ (the deliverer from trouble).\n\n[59:1](sbe4113.htm#fr_128) Whence the back of that upper region is white, or\nbright.\n\n[60:1](sbe4113.htm#fr_129) The exact function of this officer is not clearly\ndefined. Though the term is also used of an ordinary village headman (Patel,\nAdhikarin, Adigar), this could hardly apply here. Saya _n_ a, on one passage,\nindeed explains the term by 'Grama _m_ nayati,' but elsewhere he explains it\nby 'Grama _n_ a _m_ neta;' and some such meaning it may perhaps have here,--\nthe head of communal administration, either for a district (like one of Manu's\nlords of a hundred, or a p. 61 thousand villages), or for the whole country.\nIf, however, the headman of a single village be intended (as the coupling of\nthe office with the Maruts might lead one to suppose), he would probably be a\nhereditary territorial proprietor residing near the place where the\ninauguration ceremony takes place. Cf. [V, 4, 4, 18](sbe4121.htm#5:4:4:18);\nand Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, p. 171.\n\n[62:1](sbe4113.htm#fr_130) Savyash _th_ ri (otherwise savyesh _th_ _ri_ ,\nsavyesh _th_ a;--savyastha, Ka _n_ va rec.) is explained by the commentaries\nas a synonym of sarathi, charioteer (with which it is compounded in savyesh\n_th_ asarathi, Taitt. Br. I, 7, 9, 1, where Saya _n_ a makes them the two\ncharioteers standing on the left and right side of the warrior), but it seems\nmore probable that the former terms refer to the warrior (\xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xcf\x81\xce\xb1\xce\xb2\xce\xac\xcf\x84\xce\xb7\xcf\x82) himself\n(as savyash _th_ a, Atharva-veda VIII, 8, 23, undoubtedly does), who stands on\nthe left side of the driver (sarathi, \xe1\xbc\xa1\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb7\xce\xbf\xcf\x87\xce\xbf\xcf\x82); the Change of meaning being\nperhaps due to caste scruples about so close an association between the\nKshatriya warrior and his _S_ udra servant, as is implied in this and other\npassages. (Cf. V, 3, 2, 2 with note.)--On Taitt. S. I, 8, 9, Saya _n_ a\nexplains sa _m_ grahit _ri_ as the treasurer (dhanasa _m_ grahakarta ko _s_\nadhyaksha _h_ ), but on I, 8, 16 optionally as treasurer or charioteer; while\nthe Suta is I, 8, 9 identified by him with the charioteer (sarathi). It is\nmore probable, however, that at the time of the Brahma _n_ a the Suta occupied\nmuch the same position as that assigned to him in the epics, viz. that of\ncourt-bard and chronicler. The connection of the sa _m_ grahit _ri_ with the A\n_s_ vins can also scarcely be said to favour the interpretation of the term\nproposed by Saya _n_ a (who, moreover, is himself compelled, on Taitt. S. I,\n8, 15; Taitt. Br. I, 7, 10, 6, to take it in the sense of charioteer).\n\n[63:1](sbe4113.htm#fr_131) The meaning 'tax-gatherer, collector of tithes (or\nrather, of the sixth part of produce)' assigned to the term by Saya _n_ a,\nboth here, and on Taitt. S. I, 8, 9, might seem the more natural one,\nconsidering the etymology of the term. See, however, the explanation given of\nit in our Brahma _n_ a I, 1, 2, 17:--'Pushan is bhagadugha (distributor of\nportions) to the gods, who places with his hands the food before them.' This\nclearly is Homer's \xce\xb4\xce\xb1\xce\xb9\xcf\x84\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, Od. I, 141-2:\n\n\xce\xb4\xce\xb1\xce\xb9\xcf\x84\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb8\xcf\x82 \xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb2 \xce\xba\xcf\x81\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xe1\xbf\xb6 \xcf\x80\xe1\xbd\xb7\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xba\xce\xb1\xcf\x82 \xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xcf\x81\xce\xad\xce\xb8\xce\xb7\xce\xba\xce\xb5\xce\xbd \xe1\xbc\x80\xce\xb5\xe1\xbd\xb7\xcf\x81\xce\xb1\xcf\x82  \n\xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\xb7\xcf\x89\xce\xbd, \xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb0 \xce\xb4\xce\xad \xcf\x83\xcf\x86\xce\xb9 \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb7\xce\xb8\xce\xb5\xce\xb9 \xcf\x87\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xbb\xcf\x83\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xce\xb1 \xce\xba\xe1\xbd\xbb\xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xce\xbb\xce\xbb\xce\xb1\n\n[63:2](sbe4113.htm#fr_132) See [V, 2, 5, 8](sbe4112.htm#5:2:5:8).\n\n[63:3](sbe4113.htm#fr_133) 'The thrower, or keeper, of the dice,' according to\nSaya _n_ a. At V, 4, 4, 6 the verb a-vap is used of the throwing the dice into\nthe hand of the player; and it is perhaps that function of the keeper of the\ndice which is meant to be expressed by the term ('der Zuwerfer der Wurfel').\n\n[63:4](sbe4113.htm#fr_134) Literally, the cutter up of cows, the (beef-)\nbutcher. But according to Saya _n_ a, this official was the constant companion\nof his master in the chase.\n\n[64:1](sbe4113.htm#fr_135) Or, a dice-box, as 'akshavapanam' is explained by\nsome commentaries.--aksha upyante\xe0\xa4\xbdsminn ity akshavapanam\naksha(?akshadyuta-)sthanavapanapatram, Say.\n\n[64:2](sbe4113.htm#fr_136) Or, fastened with a hair-chain (romasra _g_ a\nprabaddham, Say.).\n\n[64:3](sbe4113.htm#fr_137) That is to say, the knife and the dice-board are\nthe objects those two officials have chiefly to do with.\n\n[65:1](sbe4113.htm#fr_138) According to the commentary on Katy. _S_ r. XV, 3,\n35 she has to betake herself to a Brahman's house, where the king has no\npower.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 3, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe4114.htm)\n\n"
