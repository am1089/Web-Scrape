In just the same way, there is no freedom for\nhim who seeks union, while selfishness endures.\n\nWhen the false self ceases utterly, and the motions of the mind caused by it\ncome to an end, then, by discerning the hidden Self, the real truth that "I am\nthat" is found.\n\np. 51\n\nGive up at once the thought of "I" in the action of the selfish personality,\nin the changeful self, which is but a reflection of the real Self, destroying\nrest in the Self; from falsely attributing reality to which are incurred birth\nand death and old age, fruitful in sorrow, the pilgrimage of the soul; but\nreality belongs to the bidden Self, whose form is consciousness, whose body is\nbliss; whose nature is ever one, the conscious Self, the Master, whose form is\nBliss, whose glory is unspeakable; there is no cause of the soul\'s pilgrimage\nbut the attribution of the reality of this to the selfish personality.\n\nTherefore this selfish personality, the enemy of the Self, like a thorn in the\nthroat of the eater, being cut away by the great sword of knowledge, thou\nshalt enjoy the bliss of the Self\'s sovereignty, according to thy desire.\n\nTherefore bringing to an end the activity of the selfish personality, all\npassion being laid aside when the supreme object is gained, rest silent,\nenjoying the bliss of the Self, in the Eternal, through the perfect Self, from\nall doubt free.\n\nMighty selfishness, even though cut down root and all, if brought to life\nagain even for a moment, in thought, causes a hundred dissipations of energy,\nas a cloud shaken by the wind in the rainy seasons, pours forth its floods.\n\nAfter seizing the enemy, selfishness, no respite at all is to be given to it,\nby thoughts of sensual objects. Just this is the cause of its coming to life\nagain, as water is of the lime tree that had withered away. [310]\n\np. 52\n\nThe desirer is constituted by the bodily self; how can the cause of desire be\ndifferent? Hence the motion of enticement to sensual objects is the cause of\nworld-bondage, through attachment to what is other than Self.\n\nFrom increase of action, it is seen that the seed of bondage is energized;\nwhen action is destroyed, the seed is destroyed. Hence let him check sensual\naction.\n\nFrom the growth of mind-images comes the action, from action the mind-image\ngrows; hence the man\'s pilgrimage ceases not.\n\nTo cut the bonds of the world\'s pilgrimage, both must be burned away by the\nascetic. And the growth of mind-images comes from these two--imagining and\nexternal action.\n\nGrowing from these two, it brings forth the pilgrimage of the soul. The way of\ndestroying these three in every mode of consciousness, should be constantly\nsought.\n\nBy looking on all as the Eternal, everywhere, in every way, and by\nstrengthening the mind-image of real being, this triad comes to melt away.\n\nIn the destruction of actions will arise the destruction of imaginings, and\nfrom this the dispersal of mind-images. The thorough dispersal of mind-images\nis freedom; this is called freedom even in life.\n\nWhen the mind-image of the real grows up, in the dispersal of the mind\'s\nalarms, and the mind-image of the selfish personality melts away, as even\nthick darkness is quickly melted away before the light of the sun.\n\nThe action of the greatest darkness, the snare of\n\np. 53\n\nunreality, is no longer seen when the lord of day is arisen; so in the shining\nof the essence of secondless bliss, no bond exists nor scent of sorrow.\n\nTranscending every visible object of sense, fixing the mind on pure being, the\ntotality of bliss, with right intentness within and without, pass the time\nwhile the bonds of action last. [320]\n\nWavering in reliance on the Eternal must never be allowed; wavering is death--\nthus said the sop. of the Evolver.\n\nThere is no other danger for him who knows, but this wavering as to the Self\'s\nreal nature. Thence arises delusion, and thence selfish personality; thence\ncomes bondage, and therefrom sorrow.\n\nThrough beholding sensual objects, forgetfulness bewilders a wise man even, as\na woman her favorite lover.\n\nAs sedge pushed back does not remain even for a moment, just in the same way\ndoes the world-glamor close over a wise man, who looks away from the Real.\n\nIf the imagination falling even a little from its aim, towards outward\nobjects, it falls on and on, through unsteadiness, like a player\'s fallen on a\nrow of steps.\n\nIf the thought enters into sensual objects, it becomes intent on their\nqualities; from this intentness immediately arises desire, and, from desire,\nevery action of man.\n\nHence than this wavering there is no worse death for one who has gained\ndiscernment, who has beheld the Eternal in spiritual concentration. By right\nintentness he at once gains success; be thou intent on the Self, with all\ncarefulness.\n\np. 54\n\nThen comes loss of knowledge of one\'s real being, and he who has lost it\nfalls; and destruction of him who thus falls is seen, but not restoration.\n\nLet him put away the wilful motions of the mind, the cause of every evil act;\nhe who has unity in life, has unity after his body is gone. The scripture of\nsentences says that he who beholds difference has fear.\n\nWhenever even a wise man beholds difference in the endless Eternal, though\nonly as much as an atom, what he beholds through wavering becomes a fear to\nhim through its difference. [330]\n\nAll scripture, tradition and logic disregarding, whoever makes the thought of\nself in visible things, falls upon sorrow after sorrow; thus disregarding, he\nis like a thief in darkness.\n\nHe whose delight is attachment to the real, freed, he gains the greatness of\nthe Self, eternal; but he who delights in attachment to the false, perishes;\nthis is seen in the case of the thief and him who is no thief.\n\nThe ascetic, who has put away the cause of bondage--attachment to the unreal--\nstands in the vision of the Self, saying, "this Self am I"; this resting in\nthe Eternal, brings joy by experiencing it, and takes away the supreme sorrow\nthat we feel, whose cause is unwisdom.\n\nAttachment to the outward brings as its fruit the perpetual increase of evil\nmind-images. Knowing this and putting away outward things by discernment, let\nhim place his attachment in the Self forever.\n\nWhen the outward is checked, there is restfulness from emotion; when emotion\nis at rest, there is vision of the supreme Self. When the Self is seen, the\nbondage\n\np. 55\n\nof the world is destroyed; the checking of the outward is the path of freedom.\n\nWho, being learned, discerning between real and unreal, knowing the teaching\nof the scripture, and beholding the supreme object with understanding, would\nplace his reliance on the unreal, even though longing to be free--like a\nchild, compassing his own destruction.\n\nThere is no freedom for him who is full of attachment to the body and its\nlike; for him who is free, there is no wish for the body and its like; the\ndreamer is not awake, he who is awake dreams not; for these things are the\nopposites of each other.\n\nKnowing the Self as within and without, in things stable and moving--\ndiscerning this through the Self, through its comprehending all things--\nputting off every disguise, and recognizing no division, standing firm through\nthe perfect Self--such a one is free.\n\nThrough the All-self comes the cause of freedom from bondage; than the being\nof the All-self there is no other cause; and this arises when there is no\ngrasping after the outer; he gains the being of the All-self by perpetually\nresting on the Self.\n\nHow should cessation of grasping after the outer not fail for him who, through\nthe bodily self remains with mind attached to enjoyment of outward objects,\nand thus engages in action. It can only be effortfully accomplished by those\nwho have renounced the sensual aims of all acts and rites, who are perfected\nin resting on the eternal Self, who know reality, who long for reality and\nbliss in the Self. [340]\n\nThe scripture that speaks of "him who is at peace,\n\np. 56\n\ncontrolled," teaches the ecstasy of the ascetic, whose work is the study of\nwisdom, to the end of gaining the All-self.\n\nThe destruction of personality which has risen up in power cannot be done at\nonce, even by the learned, except those who are immovably fixed in the ecstasy\nwhich no doubt can assail, for the mind-images are of endless rebirth.\n\nBinding a man with the delusion of belief in his personality, through the\npower that veils, the power that propels casts him forth, through its\npotencies.\n\nThe victory over this compelling power cannot be accomplished, until the power\nthat veils has come to cessation with residue. The power that veils is,\nthrough the force of its own nature, destroyed, when the seer is discerned\nfrom what is seen, as milk is distinguished from water.\n\nPerfect discernment, born of clear awakening, arises free from doubt, and pure\nof all bondage, where there is no propelling power towards delusive objects,\nonce the division is made between the real natures of the seer and what is\nseen; he cuts the bonds of delusion that glamor makes, and, after that, there\nis no more pilgrimage for the free.\n\nThe flame of discernment of the oneness of the higher and the lower, burns up\nthe forest of unwisdom utterly. What seed of the soul\'s pilgrimage can there\nbe for him who has gained being in which there is no duality?\n\nAnd the cessation of the veiling power arises from perfect knowledge; the\ndestruction of false knowledge\n\np. 57\n\nis the cessation of the pain engendered by the propelling power.\n\nThe triple error is understood by knowing the real nature of the rope;\ntherefore the reality of things is to be known by the wise to the end of\nfreedom from bondage.\n\nAs iron from union with fire, so, from union with the real, thought expands as\nmaterial things; hence the triple effect of this, seen in delusion, dream,\ndesire, is but a mirage.\n\nThence come all changing forms in nature beginning with personality and ending\nwith the body, and all sensual objects; these are unreal, because subject to\nchange every moment; but the Self never changes. [350]\n\nConsciousness, eternal, non-dual, partless, uniform, witness of intellect and\nthe rest, different from existent and non-existent; its real meaning is the\nidea of "I"; a union of being and bliss--this is the higher Self.\n\nHe who thus understands, discerning the real from the unreal, ascertaining\nreality by his own awakened vision, knowing his own Self as partless\nawakening, freed from these things reaches peace in the Self.\n\nThen melts the heart\'s knot of unwisdom without residue, when, through the\necstasy in which there is no doubt, arises the vision of the non-dual Self.\n\nThrough the mind\'s fault are built the thoughts of thou and I and this, in the\nsupreme Self which is non-dual, and beyond which there is nothing; but when\necstasy is reached, all his doubts melt away through apprehension of the real.\n\nPeaceful, controlled, possessing the supreme cessation,\n\np. 58\n\nperfect in endurance, entering into lasting ecstasy, the ascetic makes the\nbeing of the All-self his own; thereby burning up perfectly the doubts that\nare born of the darkness of unwisdom, he dwells in bliss in the form of the\nEternal, without deed or doubt.\n\nThey who rest on the Self that is consciousness, who have put away the\noutward, the imaginations of the ear and senses, and selfish personality,\nthey, verily, are free from the bonds and snares of the world, but not they\nwho only meditate on what others have seen.\n\nThe Self is divided by the division of its disguises; when the disguises are\nremoved, the Self is lonely and pure; hence let the wise man work for the\nremoval of the disguises by resting in the ecstasy that is free from doubt.\n\nAttracted by the Self the man goes to the being of the Self by resting on it\nalone; the grub, thinking on the bee, builds up the nature of the bee.\n\nThe grub, throwing off attachment to other forms, and thinking intently on the\nbee, takes on the nature of the bee; even thus he who seeks for union,\nthinking intently on the reality of the supreme Self, perfectly enters that\nSelf, resting on it alone.\n\nVery subtle, as it were, is the reality of the supreme Self, nor can it be\nreached by gross vision; by the exceedingly subtle state of ecstasy it is to\nbe known by those who are worthy, whose minds are altogether pure. [360]\n\nAs gold purified in the furnace, rids itself of dross and reaches the quality\nof its own self, so the mind\n\np. 59\n\nridding itself of the dross of substance, force and darkness, through\nmeditation, enters into reality.\n\nWhen purified by the power of uninterrupted intentness, the mind is thus\nmelted in the Eternal, then ecstasy is purified of all doubt, and of itself\nenjoys the essence of secondless bliss.\n\nThrough this ecstasy comes destruction of the knot of accumulated mind-images,\ndestruction of all works; within and without, for ever and altogether, the\nform of the Self becomes manifest, without any effort at all.\n\nLet him know that thinking is a hundred times better than scripture; that\nconcentration, thinking the matter out, is a hundred thousand times better\nthan thinking; that ecstasy free from doubt is endlessly better than\nconcentration.\n\nThrough unwavering ecstasy is clearly understood the reality of the Eternal,\nfixed and sure. This cannot be when other thoughts are confused with it, by\nthe motions of the mind.\n\nTherefore with powers of sense controlled enter in ecstasy into the hidden\nSelf, with mind at peace perpetually; destroy the darkness made by\nbeginningless unwisdom, through the clear view of the oneness of the real.\n\nThe first door of union is the checking of voice, the cessation of grasping,\nfreedom from expectation and longing, the character bent ever on the one end.\n\nA centering of the mind on the one end, is the cause of the cessation of\nsensuality; control is the cause that puts an end to imaginings; by peace, the\nmind-image of the personality is melted away; from this arises unshaken\n\np. 60\n\nenjoyment of the essence of bliss in the Eternal for ever, for him who seeks\nunion; therefore the checking of the imagination is ever to be practiced\neffortfully, O ascetic!\n\nHold voice in the self, hold the self in intellect, hold intellect in the\nwitness of intellect, and, merging the witness in the perfect Self, enjoy\nsupreme peace.\n\nThe seeker for union shares the nature of each disguise--body, vital breath,\nsense, mind, intellect--when his thoughts are fixed on that disguise. [370]\n\nWhen he ceases from this sharing, the ascetic reaches perfect cessation and\nhappiness, and is plunged in the essence of Being and Bliss.\n\nRenouncing inwardly, renouncing outwardly--this is possible only for him who\nis free from passion; and he who is free from passion renounces all attachment\nwithin and without, through the longing for freedom.\n\nOutward attachment arises through sensual objects; inward attachment, through\npersonality. Only he who, resting in the Eternal, is free from passion, is\nable to give them up. Freedom from passion and awakening are the wings of the\nspirit. O wise man, understand these two wings! For without them you cannot\nrise to the crown of the tree of life.\n\nSoul-vision belongs to him who is free from passion; steady inspiration\nbelongs to the soul-seer. Freedom from bondage belongs to the reality of\ninspiration; enjoyment of perpetual bliss belongs to the Self that is free.\n\nI see no engenderer of happiness greater than freedom from passion for him who\nis self-controlled; if\n\np. 61\n\nvery pure inspiration of the Self be joined to it, he enters into the\nsovereignty of self-dominion. This is the door of young freedom everlasting.\nThere do thou ever fix thy consciousness on the real self, in all ways free\nfrom attachment to what is other than this, for the sake of the better way.\n\nCut off all hope in sensual objects which are like poison, the cause of death;\nabandon all fancies of birth and family and social state; put all ritual\nactions far away; renounce the illusion of self -dwelling in the body, center\nthe consciousness on the Self. Thou art the seer, thou art the stainless, thou\nart in truth the supreme, secondless Eternal.\n\nFirmly fixing the mind on the goal, the Eternal, keeping the outward senses in\ntheir own place, with form unmoved, heedless of the body\'s state, entering\ninto the oneness of Self and Eternal by assimilating the Self and rising above\nall differences, for ever drink the essence of the bliss of the Eternal in the\nSelf. What profit is there in other things that give no joy? [378]\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Free Even in Life](cjw10.htm)\n\n'
