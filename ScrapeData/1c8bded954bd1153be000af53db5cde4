This (Agni) has been established here as the first by the establishers,\nthe Hot _ri_ , the best sacrificer who should be magnified at the sacrifices,\nwhom Apnavana and the Bh _ri_ gus have made shine, brilliant in the woods,\nspreading to every house.\n\n2\\. Agni! When will the splendour of thee, the god, appear in the right way?\nFor verily the mortals have seized thee who shouldst be magnified in the\nhouses.\n\n3\\. Seeing the righteous, wise one, like the heaven with the stars, who\nproduces joy at all sacrifices, from house to house--\n\n4\\. The quick messenger of Vivasvat who rules over all human tribes: Him the\n\xc3\x82yus have brought hither to every house, the light, him who belongs to the Bh\n_ri_ gus.\n\n5\\. Him the knowing one they have set down in the right way as the Hot _ri_ ,\nthe gay one with his purifying flames, the best sacrificer with his seven\n(forms [1](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:5:1))--\n\n6\\. Him who is enveloped in many mothers, in the wood\n[1](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:6:1), who does not rest thereon (?)\n[2](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:6:2), who is brilliant, though hidden in secret,\neasily to be found, and striving for all that is desired.\n\n7\\. When the gods rejoiced in the \xe2\x80\xa6 of the herbs [1](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:7:1),\nin that udder [2](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:7:2), in the foundation of _Ri_ ta\n[3](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:7:3), the great -Agni, to whom offerings are made with\nadoration, the righteous one, always approached eagerly for the sake of\nsacrifice.\n\np. 344\n\n8 [1](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:8:1). Thou, the knowing one, hast eagerly performed\nthe messengership of the sacrifice, looking over both ends, over the two\nworlds. Thou goest as a messenger, chosen from of old, thou who knowest best\nthe ascents to heaven.\n\n9\\. Thy path is black. Light is before thee, the red one. Thy flame is speedy.\nThis is one of the wonders: when the virgin conceives (thee as her) child\n[1](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:9:1), thou becomest a messenger, as soon as thou art\nborn.\n\n10\\. As soon as he is born, his strength shows itself, when the wind blows\nupon his flame. He turns his sharp tongue among the dry brushwood. Even solid\nfood he tears to pieces with his teeth.\n\n11\\. When he thirstily has grown strong by thirsty food\n[1](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:11:1), restless Agni appoints a thirsty messenger.\nConsuming (the wood) he follows the \xe2\x80\xa6 [2](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:11:2) of the\nwind. He seems to drive forward a quick horse; the racer speeds along.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. The metre is _G_ agati in verse 1, Anush _t_ ubh in verses\n2-6, Trish _t_ ubh in verses 7-11.--Verse 1 = VS. III, 15; XV, 26; XXXIII, 6;\nTS. I, 5, 5, 1; MS. I, 5, 1.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The seven flames or tongues of Agni? The seven Hot _ri_ s? The seven\nRatnas?\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Cf. IX, 107, 18. pari gobhi _h_ uttara _h_ si\xc2\xb4dan vaneshu avyata.\n\np. 345\n\nNote 2. Possibly we might conjecture a\xc2\xb4 _s_ ritam, 'who rests thereon.'\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. On sasasya, cf. above, III, 5, 6, note 2. Viyuta seems to be a\nlocative standing parallel with the locative u\xc2\xb4dhan. We have here sasasya\nviyuta \xe2\x80\xa6 _ri_ tasya dha\xc2\xb4man, quite as in V, 21, 4 the two accusatives _ri_\ntasya yonim and sasasya yonim stand parallel. The meaning of viyuta, however,\nseems to me quite uncertain. Is it an action-noun derived from vi-yu, 'to\nseparate,' 'to keep off,' or from (vi-) va, 'to weave'? Professor Max Muller\nproposes: 'at the removal of the grass or tinder in which the spark is kept. '\n\nNote 2. sasmin u\xc2\xb4dhan; cf. below, 10, 8.\n\nNote 3. Cf. above, I, 147, 1.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. With this verse, compare below, hymn 8, verse 4.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. The wood, the child of which is Agni.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. I take anna here as an instrumental.--Compare with our passage VII, 3,\n4. t _ri_ shu yat anna samav _ri_ kta _g_ ambhai _h_ ; X, 79, 5. ya _h_ asmai\nannam t _ri_ shu adadhati; X, 91, 7. t _ri_ shu yat anna vevishat vitish _th_\nase; X, 113, 8. agni _h_ ni gambhai _h_ t _ri_ shu annam avayat.\n\nNote 2. me _l_ im; cf. above, III, 26, 9.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 8](sbe46097.htm)\n\n"
