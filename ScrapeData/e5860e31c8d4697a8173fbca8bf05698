Narud Jee having beheld with delight the beautiful appearance of\nthe forests and groves, saw on going into the city elegant, golden houses,\ncovered with jewels, and shining brilliantly, on which flags and banners were\nwaving. Wreaths and garlands of flowers were fastened upon each\n\np. 350\n\ngate-way, at the doors were placed pillars of plantain and water-pots of gold,\nfilled with sprouts. From the trellis-work, windows and lattices of each\nhouse, the smoke of the perfume, burnt at the time of worshipping, came\ncurling forth, like a black cloud; in the midst of which the golden spires\nshone like lightning; in every dwelling there was worshipping and reading of\nprayers, and sacrifice and offering of gifts; and in every place people were\nengaged in adoration and meditation, songs and reading, and hearing the\nPooranus; here and there the descendants of Judoo were seated, forming a\ncourt, similar to that of Indru, and joy was diffused throughout the city.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O great king! Narud Jee being highly gratified on entering the\ncity, began to say, "To what house shall I go first to find Shree Krishnu\nChund?" Saying this, O great king! to himself, Narud Jee went to Shree\nRookmunee\'s house, where Shree Krishnu Chund was reclining at his ease, and\nwho rose and stood up on seeing him; they brought a ewer of Rookmunee\'s filled\nwith water; Krishnu, having washed Narud Jee\'s feet, and given him a seat,\nplaced before him perfume, lamps and consecrated food, and offering adoration\nbegan to say to him with joined hands, "Happiness and wealth will follow the\nman in whose house the feet of good men fall. You have come and paid me, a\nhouseholder, a visit in my house, for the sake of my salvation."\n\nO great king! when Krishnu had thus spoken, Narud Jee giving him this\nblessing, "May you long live to protect Shree Rookmunee," went to the abode of\nJamwutee, where he saw Huri playing at choupur. On seeing Narud Jee, Krishnu\nrose up; when, having given him a blessing, Narud went away again; after this\nhe went to Sutbhama\'s and saw Shree Krishnu Chund seated, and having oil and\nperfumed paste applied to his body, Narud Jee returned thence in silence,\n\np. 351\n\nbecause it is written in the Shastrus "That at the time of the application of\noil, a Raja should not make a salutation, nor a brahmin pronounce a\nbenediction," Narud Jee then went to Kalindee\'s house, and there saw Huri\nasleep. O great king! Kalindee, on seeing Narud Jee, began to rub Huri\'s feet,\nand awoke him, Krishnu, on awaking, approached the sage; and having made an\nobeisance, said with joined hands "The feet of holy men are like the waters of\nplaces of pilgrimage; wherever they fall they purify." On hearing this and\nhaving given his blessing, Narud Jee rose, and went thence to the residence of\nMittrabinda, he there saw brahmins being fed, and Shree Krishnu serving out\nfood to them, Krishnu said, on seeing Narud Jee, "O great king! as you have\ndone me the favour to come here, please partake of this food, and give me your\nleavings, and make pure my house." Narud Jee replied, "O great king! I will\ncome again, after having gone round to a few other houses, be pleased to serve\nout food to the brahmins, and I will take what is left on my return." With\nthese words, Narud Jee took leave and went to Sutya\'s house, and there saw\nShree Beharee, the benefactor of his worshippers, sitting pleased, and amusing\nhimself, on beholding this state of affairs, Narud Jee went away thence, and\nhaving then gone to Bhudra\'s abode, saw Huri eating, he returned thence to the\nhouse of Luchmuna, and there saw Krishnu bathing.\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative Shree Shookdeo said,--O great king!\nin this manner the sage, Narud Jee, went about to sixteen thousand one hundred\nand eight houses, but did not see a single house without Shree Krishnu in it,\nand wherever he beheld him he saw him engaged in some domestic occupation,\nhaving observed this custom Narud was astonished, "That there was not a house\nwithout Krishnu in it, wherever I go, there is the beloved Huri; thus has\nKrishnu spread about his pastimes. In each of the sixteen thousand one hundred\nand eight houses, the supporter of the hill (Krishnu)\n\np. 352\n\nremains with one of his wives." The delighted sage said reflecting, "The\ndeceptive power, which jogees are supposed to possess, belongs to thee, O lord\nof the Judoos! no one can understand this power; and who can escape from it?"\nO great king! when Narud Jee, in a state of astonishment, had thus spoken,\nShree Krishnu Chund, the bestower of happiness said, "Narud! be not all\ngrieved in thy mind; my delusive power is very mighty and has been spread over\nthe whole world; it fascinates even me, who else has ability to escape from\nits influence, and who that has come into the world is not affected by it."\nNarud having heard this and bowing his head, said, beseechingly, "Take\ncompassion on me, O lord of the Judoos! in order that veneration for thee may\nexist always in my thoughts and that my mind, being under the influence of\ndelusion, may not desire objects of sense." Raja! Narud Jee having thus\nspoken, took leave of Krishnu, and, having made the usual parting salutation,\nreturned to his own dwelling playing on the lute and singing. Shree Krishnu\nChund Jee continued his pastimes at Dwarka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXI](psa72.htm)\n\n'
