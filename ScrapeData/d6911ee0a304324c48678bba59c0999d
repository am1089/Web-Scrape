It need not pine to death for want of me."\n\n"Let it perish, for all I care! That is not troubling me. I am thinking about\nmyself."\n\n"Oh, indeed. Tell me what about yourself?"\n\nMy husband was silent, with a smile.\n\nI knew his way, and protested at once: "No, no, you are not going to run away\nfrom me like that! I want to have this out with you."\n\n"Can one ever finish a subject with words?"\n\n"Do stop speaking in riddles. Tell me..."\n\n"What I want is, that I should have you, and you should have me, more fully in\nthe outside world. That is where we are still in debt to each other."\n\n"Is anything wanting, then, in the love we have here at home?"\n\n"Here you are wrapped up in me. You know neither what you have, nor what you\nwant."\n\n"I cannot bear to hear you talk like this."\n\n"I would have you come into the heart of the outer world and meet reality.\nMerely going on with your household duties, living all your life in the world\nof household conventions and the drudgery of household tasks--you were not\nmade for that! If we meet, and recognize each other, in the real world, then\nonly will our love be true."\n\n"If there be any drawback here to our full recognition of each other, then I\nhave nothing to say. But as for myself, I feel no want."\n\n"Well, even if the drawback is only on my side, why shouldn\'t you help to\nremove it?"\n\nSuch discussions repeatedly occurred. One day he said: "The greedy man who is\nfond of his fish stew has no compunction in cutting up the fish according to\nhis need. But the man who loves the fish wants to enjoy it in the water; and\nif that is impossible he waits on the bank; and even if he comes back home\nwithout a sight of it he has the consolation of knowing that the fish is all\nright. Perfect gain is the best of all; but if that is impossible, then the\nnext best gain is perfect losing.\n\nI never liked the way my husband had of talking on this subject, but that is\nnot the reason why I refused to leave the zenana. His grandmother was still\nalive. My husband had filled more than a hundred and twenty per cent of the\nhouse with the twentieth century, against her taste; but she had borne it\nuncomplaining. She would have borne it, likewise, if the daughter-in-law  7 of\nthe Rajah\'s house had left its seclusion. She was even prepared for this\nhappening. But I did not consider it important enough to give her the pain of\nit. I have read in books that we are called "caged birds". I cannot speak for\nothers, but I had so much in this cage of mine that there was not room for it\nin the universe--at least that is what I then felt.\n\nThe grandmother, in her old age, was very fond of me. At the bottom of her\nfondness was the thought that, with the conspiracy of favourable stars which\nattended me, I had been able to attract my husband\'s love. Were not men\nnaturally inclined to plunge downwards? None of the others, for all their\nbeauty, had been able to prevent their husbands going headlong into the\nburning depths which consumed and destroyed them. She believed that I had been\nthe means of extinguishing this fire, so deadly to the men of the family. So\nshe kept me in the shelter of her bosom, and trembled if I was in the least\nbit unwell.\n\nHis grandmother did not like the dresses and ornaments my husband brought from\nEuropean shops to deck me with. But she reflected: "Men will have some absurd\nhobby or other, which is sure to be expensive. It is no use trying to check\ntheir extravagance; one is glad enough if they stop short of ruin. If my\nNikhil had not been busy dressing up his wife there is no knowing whom else he\nmight have spent his money on!" So whenever any new dress of mine arrived she\nused to send for my husband and make merry over it.\n\nThus it came about that it was her taste which changed. The influence of the\nmodern age fell so strongly upon her, that her evenings refused to pass if I\ndid not tell her stories out of English books.\n\nAfter his grandmother\'s death, my husband wanted me to go and live with him in\nCalcutta. But I could not bring myself to do that. Was not this our House,\nwhich she had kept under her sheltering care through all her trials and\ntroubles? Would not a curse come upon me if I deserted it and went off to\ntown? This was the thought that kept me back, as her empty seat reproachfully\nlooked up at me. That noble lady had come into this house at the age of eight,\nand had died in her seventy-ninth year. She had not spent a happy life. Fate\nhad hurled shaft after shaft at her breast, only to draw out more and more the\nimperishable spirit within. This great house was hallowed with her tears. What\nshould I do in the dust of Calcutta, away from it?\n\nMy husband\'s idea was that this would be a good opportunity for leaving to my\nsister-in-law the consolation of ruling over the household, giving our life,\nat the same time, more room to branch out in Calcutta. That is just where my\ndifficulty came in. She had worried my life out, she ill brooked my husband\'s\nhappiness, and for this she was to be rewarded! And what of the day when we\nshould have to come back here? Should I then get back my seat at the head?\n\n"What do you want with that seat?" my husband would say. "Are there not more\nprecious things in life?"\n\nMen never understand these things. They have their nests in the outside world;\nthey little know the whole of what the household stands for. In these matters\nthey ought to follow womanly guidance. Such were my thoughts at that time.\n\nI felt the real point was, that one ought to stand up for one\'s rights. To go\naway, and leave everything in the hands of the enemy, would be nothing short\nof owning defeat.\n\nBut why did not my husband compel me to go with him to Calcutta? I know the\nreason. He did not use his power, just because he had it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[6](hw02.htm#fr_5) The seclusion of the zenana, and all the customs peculiar\nto it, are designated by the general term "Purdah", which means Screen.\n\n[7](hw02.htm#fr_6) The prestige of the daughter-in-law is of the first\nimportance in a Hindu household of rank [Trans.].\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III](hw03.htm)\n\n'
