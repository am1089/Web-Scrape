Rohnee\nhas been pregnant, and had a son--What is his age, how powerful is he, what is\nhis name? And Nund Jee has had a son, and sent for you."\n\nOn hearing this Gurug, the sage, being highly pleased, departed, and came near\nGokool. Some one went and told Nund Jee, that Gurug, the sage, the family\npriest of the Judoos, was coming. On hearing it, Nund Jee delighted, and\naccompanied by the cowherds\' children, took with him presents, and went out to\nmeet him; and having spread carpets of silk for him to walk upon, brought him\nto his house amidst musical rejoicings. Having performed poojah, placing him\nupon a seat, and taking the water, with which his feet had been washed, the\nwife and husband, joining their hands, began to say, "O great king! great is\nour good fortune, that you have been so compassionate as to come and purify\nour house by giving us a sight of you. Through your majesty, two sons have\nbeen born; one Rohnee\'s; the other, ours: be so kind as to give them names."\nGurug, the sage, said, "Thus to give them names\n\np. 38\n\nwould not be proper; because, if it shall be spread abroad, that Gurug, the\nsage, has gone to Gokool to give names to children, and Kuns shall hear of it,\nhe will think that some one has conveyed Dewukee\'s son to the house of his\nfriend, Basoodeo; and, therefore, the family priest has gone there. Thinking\nthus he will have me apprehended, and there is no knowing what violence he may\ndo to you. For this reason, do not make the matter at all public, but give the\nnames silently (or have the names given silently,) in your own house."\n\nNund said, "Gurug Jee! you have spoken truly." Saying this, he took him into\nhis own house, and placed him upon a seat. Then Gurug, the sage, having\nenquired from Nund Jee the lunar day and time of birth of both, having\ndetermined the fortunate moment, and resolved upon what their names should be,\nsaid, "Nund Jee! the son of Rohnee, the wife of Basoodeo, shall have the\nfollowing names, Sunkurkun, Kewuteerummun, Buldao, Bulram, Kalindeebhedun,\nHuldhur, and Bulbeer. And with respect to your son, in the form of Krishnu,\nhis names shall be numberless; but as he was once born in the house of\nBasoodeo, he has been named Basoodeo. And it is my opinion, that whenever\nthese two children of yours shall be born in the four ages, they shall be born\ntogether." Nund Jee said, "Explain their good qualities."--Gurug the sage\nreplied, "They are deities; it is impossible to understand their state; but I\nknow this much, that, having killed Kuns, they will remove the burdens of the\nworld." Having thus spoken, Gurug, the sage, departed in silence, and went,\nand told all the news to Basoodeo. After this, both the children began to\nincrease in stature daily in Gokool, and give pleasure to Nund and Jusodha, by\nplaying childish tricks; wearing blue and yellow dresses, with short curls\nfloating loose on their foreheads, with amulets, knotted strings and necklaces\non their necks, and toys in their hands, they played about; crawling about the\ncourt-yard on their knees, they fell down\n\np. 39\n\nand lisped out their words--Rohnee and Jusodha followed them about, lest the\nchildren, frightened at any one, should trip and fall. When having laid hold\nof the young calves\' tails, they got up, and afterwards fell down, Jusodha and\nRohnee taking them up, and pressing them to their bosoms with the greatest\naffection, suckled them, and coaxed them in every possible way.\n\nWhen Shree Krishnu grew bigger, he one day took the cowherds\' children with\nhim to Bruj to steal butter.\n\nThey searched for it in empty houses, and Krishnu allowed them to steal\nwhatever they found. They carried away the milk pails, which were set apart\nand covered up, belonging to all whom they found asleep in their houses.\nWherever they found it suspended on strings, placing a board upon a stool, a\nwooden mortar upon the board, and making one of their companions stand upon\nthe mortar, and getting upon his back, they took down the butter, ate some of\nit, stole some, and spilt some about: in this manner, they constantly\ncommitted theft in the houses of the cowherdesses. One day, they all took\ncounsel together, and allowed Krishnu to come into the house. Having entered\nthe house, as he was on the point of stealing the butter and curds, they laid\nhold of him, and said, "You have been in the habit of coming night and\nmorning; where will you escape now, you butter thief?"\n\nHaving thus spoken, when all the cowherdesses in a body, taking Krishnu with\nthem, were going to make a complaint to Jusodha regarding him, Krishnu\npractised this deception upon them, he made each mother take hold of her own\nchild by the hand, and ran off himself, and again joined the sons of the\ncowherds. When the cowherdesses came to Nund\'s wife, they fell at her feet,\nand said, "If you will not be offended, we will inform you, what acts of\ntyranny Krishnu has committed--milk, curds, butter, buttermilk do not escape\nfrom his hand; in Bruj he commits such thefts, and roams about, thieving,\nmorning and evening.\n\np. 40\n\n[paragraph continues] Wherever he finds them laid bye, and covered up, he\nfearlessly takes them away, eats some, and allows his companions to steal. If\nany one points out the mark of curds on his mouth, he perversely says, that\nthe same person placed it there. In this manner, he used to come constantly,\nand commit thefts; to-day, we have caught him, and brought him to show to\nyou." Jusodha replied, "Friends! whose child have you laid hold of, and\nbrought to me; since yesterday, my Krishnu has not gone out of the house? Is\nthis the way you speak truth?" Hearing this, and perceiving that they had hold\nof their own children, they laughed and were ashamed of themselves. Upon this,\nJusodha sent for Krishnu, and said to him, "Son! do not go to any one\'s house;\nwhatever you wish to eat, eat at home."\n\nHaving heard this, Krishnu said, lisping, "Do not, mother, place any reliance\non what they say. These false cowherdesses have spoken falsely, and have come\nroaring in pursuit of me. Sometimes, they make me lay hold of the milk-pails\nand calves; sometimes they make me perform the drudgery of the house; and\nhaving placed me at the door to watch, they go about their business, and then\ncome and tell you stories." Hearing this, the cowherdesses looking at Krishnu,\nand smiling, went away.\n\nOne day after this, Krishnu and Bulram were playing with some companions in a\ncourt-yard, when Krishnu ate some dirt:--one of his companions went and told\nJusodha, who came running towards him in a passion, with a stick in her hand.\nSeeing his mother coming towards him in a very angry humour, wiping his mouth,\nhe was frightened, and remained standing in the same spot. She, on coming up,\nasked him, "Why have you been eating mud?" Krishnu replied with fear and\ntrembling, "Mother! who has told you this?" She said, "One of your companions\nhas told me." Upon this, Mohun, being enraged, said to the companion, "When\ndid I eat mud?" He replied in alarm, "Brother! I do not understand what you\n\np. 41\n\nsay--what answer shall I give?" When Krishnu began to explain to his\ncompanion, Jusodha went and laid hold of him. Upon this, Krishnu began to say,\n"Be not angry, mother! do human creatures ever eat mud?" She said, "I will not\nlisten to your thoughtless speeches; if you really speak the truth, show me\nyour mouth." When Shree Krishnu opened his mouth, the three worlds were seen\ninside it. Jusodha was then convinced, and she began to say to herself, "I am\na great fool in looking upon the lord of the three worlds as my son."\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo said to the Raja\nPureechit,--Raja! when Nund\'s wife thought thus, Huri dissipated the delusion;\nand, Jusodha, having pressed Mohun to her bosom with affection, brought him\nhome.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter X](psa11.htm)\n\n'
