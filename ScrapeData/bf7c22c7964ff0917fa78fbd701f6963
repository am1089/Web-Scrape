Pure men of the first three castes shall prepare the food (of a\nhouseholder which is used) at the Vai _s_ vadeva ceremony. 1\n\n2\\. The (cook) shall not speak, nor cough, nor sneeze, while his face is\nturned towards the food.\n\n3\\. He shall purify himself by touching water if he has touched his hair, his\nlimbs, or his garment.\n\n4\\. Or _S_ udras may prepare the food, under the superintendence of men of the\nfirst three castes.\n\n5\\. For them is prescribed the same rule of sipping water (as for their\nmasters). 5\n\n6\\. Besides, the ( _S_ udra cooks) daily shall cause to be cut the hair of\ntheir heads, their beards, the hair on their bodies, and their nails.\n\n7\\. And they shall bathe, keeping their clothes on. 7\n\n8\\. Or they may trim (their hair and nails) on the eighth day (of each half-\nmonth), or on the days of the full and. new moon.\n\n9\\. He (the householder himself) shall place on the fire that food which has\nbeen prepared (by _S_ udras) without supervision, and shall sprinkle it with\nwater. Such food also they state to be fit for the gods.\n\n10\\. When the food is ready, (the cook) shall place\n\np. 105\n\nhimself before his master and announce it to him (saying), \'It is ready.\'\n\n11\\. The answer (of the master) shall be, \'That well-prepared food is the\nmeans to obtain splendour; may it never fail!\' 11\n\n12\\. The burnt-oblations and Bali-offerings made with the food which the\nhusband and his wife are to eat, bring (as their reward) prosperity, (and the\nenjoyment of) heaven. 12\n\n13\\. Whilst learning the sacred formulas (to be recited during the\nperformance) of those (burnt oblations and Bali-offerings, a householder)\nshall sleep on the ground, abstain from connubial intercourse and from eating\npungent condiments and salt, during twelve days. 13\n\n14\\. (When he studies the Mantras) for the last (Bali offered to the goblins),\nhe shall fast for one (day and) night. 14\n\n15\\. For each Bali-offering the ground must be prepared separately. (The\nperformer) sweeps (the ground) with his (right) hand, sprinkles it with water,\nturning, the palm downwards, throws down (the offering), and afterwards\nsprinkles water around it. 15\n\np. 106\n\n16\\. (At the Vai _s_ vadeva sacrifice) he shall offer the oblations with his\nhand, (throwing them) into the kitchen-fire or into the sacred (G _ri_\nhya)-fire, and reciting (each time one of) the first six Mantras (prescribed\nin the Naraya _n_ i Upanishad). 16\n\n17\\. He shall sprinkle water all around both times (before and after the\noblations), as (has been declared) above. 17\n\n18\\. In like manner water is sprinkled around once only after the performance\nof those Bali-offerings that are performed in one place. 18\n\n19\\. (If a seasoning) has been prepared, (the Bali-offering should consist of\nrice) mixed with that seasoning.\n\n20\\. With the seventh and eighth Mantras (Balis 20\n\np. 107\n\nmust be offered to Dharma and Adharma) behind the fire, and must be placed the\none to the north of the other.\n\n21\\. With the ninth (Mantra a Bali offered to the waters must be placed) near\nthe water-vessel (in which the water for domestic purposes is kept). 21\n\n22\\. With the tenth and eleventh (Mantras, Balis, offered to the herbs and\ntrees and to Rakshodeva _g_ ana, must be placed) in the centre of the house,\nand the one to the east of the other. 22\n\n23\\. With the following four (Mantras, Balis must be placed) in the north-\neastern part of the house (and the one to the east of the other). 23\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[104:1](sbe0238.htm#fr_542) **3**. \'The food which is used at the Vai _s_\nvadeva, i. e. the food prepared for the meals of the householder and of his\nwife.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[104:5](sbe0238.htm#fr_543) This Sutra is a _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ apaka, as it indicates\nthat \xc3\x82pastamba also recognises the different rules which are usually\nprescribed in the Sm _ri_ tis for Brahma _n_ as, Kshatriyas, Vai _s_ yas, and\n_S_ udras. See above, I, 5, 16, 2.\n\n[104:7](sbe0238.htm#fr_544) Usually in bathing both \xc3\x82ryas and _S_ udras wear\nno dress except the lango _t_ i.\n\n[105:11](sbe0238.htm#fr_545) Manu II, 54.\n\n[105:12](sbe0238.htm#fr_546) Balis are portions of food which are thrown\nbefore the door, or on the floor of the house. See below, Sutra 16 seq.\n\n[105:13](sbe0238.htm#fr_547) Others explain this Sutra thus: \'After having\nused for the first time these sacred formulas (which are to be recited in\noffering the burnt-oblation and the Balis, the householder and his wife) shall\nsleep,\' &c.\n\n[105:14](sbe0238.htm#fr_548) Regarding the use of ekaratra in the sense of \'a\n(day and a) night,\' see above. The \'last\' Bali-offering is that described\nbelow, II ,2, 4, 5.\n\n[105:15](sbe0238.htm#fr_549) \'They say that the word "afterwards" is used in\norder to indicate that perfumes, garlands, and other (Upa _k_ aras) must be,\noffered between (the last two acts).\'--Haradatta.\n\n[106:16](sbe0238.htm#fr_550) It is a disputed point with the commentators\nwhether every Brahma _n_ a may offer the Vai _s_ vadeva in the common kitchen-\nfire, or those persons only who do not keep a sacred domestic fire. The six\nMantras, which are given Taitt. \xc3\x82r. X, 67, 1, are: 1. Agnaye svaha, \'to Agni\nsvaha\'; 2. Somaya svaha, \'to Soma svaha\'; 3. Vi _s_ vebhyo devebhya _h_ svaha,\n\'to all the gods svaha\'; 4. Dhruvaya bhumaya svaha, \'to Dhruva Bhuma svaha\';\n5. Dhruvakshitaye svaha, \'to Dhruvakshiti svaha\'; 6. A _k_ yutakshitaye svaha,\n\'to A _k_ yutakshiti svaha.\' Haradatta adds that some add a seventh formula,\naddressed to Agni svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, \'to the fire which causes the proper\nperformance of the sacrifice,\' while others leave out the second Mantra and\ngive that addressed to Agni svish _t_ ak _ri_ t the sixth place. This latter\nis the order given in the Calcutta edition of the Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka.\n\n[106:17](sbe0238.htm#fr_551) \'Above, i.e. G _ri_ hya-sutra, I, 2, 3, 8.\'--\nHaradatta. The Mantras recited are: 1. at the first sprinkling, Adite\n\'numanyasva, \'Aditi permit\'; Anumate \'numanyasva, \'Anumati permit\'; Sarasvaty\nanumanyasva, \'Sarasvati permit\'; Deva Savita _h_ prasuva, \'Divine Savit _ri_\npermit\'; 2. at the second sprinkling, the same as above, anvama _m_ stha _h_\nand prasavi _h_ , \'thou hast permitted,\' being substituted for anumanyasva and\nprasuva.\n\n[106:18](sbe0238.htm#fr_552) This Sutra is a restriction of Sutra 15.\n\n[106:20](sbe0238.htm#fr_553) The first six offerings constitute the Devaya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a or Vai _s_ vadeva, which is offered in the fire. Now follow the Bali-\nofferings, which are merely placed on the ground. \'Behind the fire\' means to\nthe east of the fire\'; for the sacrificer must face the east.\n\n[107:21](sbe0238.htm#fr_554) The Mantra is, Adbbya _h_ svaha, \'to the Waters\nsvaha.\'\n\n[107:22](sbe0238.htm#fr_555) The Mantras are, Osbadhivanaspatibbya _h_ svaha,\n\'to the herbs and trees svaha\'; Raksbodeva _g_ anebhya _h_ svaha, \'to the\nRakshasas and the servants of the gods svaha.\'\n\n[107:23](sbe0238.htm#fr_556) These four Balis are sacred to the G _ri_ has, to\nthe Avasanas, to the Avasanapatis, and to all creatures.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 2, Kha _n_ _d_ a 4](sbe0239.htm)\n\n'
