And moreover (the Sa _n_ khya doctrine) is objectionable on account of\nits contradictions.\n\nThe doctrine of the Sa _n_ khyas, moreover, is full of contradictions.\nSometimes they enumerate seven senses, sometimes eleven 2. In some places they\nteach that the subtle elements of material things proceed from the great\nprinciple, in other places again that they proceed from self-consciousness.\nSometimes they speak of three internal organs, sometimes of one only 3. That\ntheir doctrine, moreover, contradicts _S_ ruti, which teaches that the Lord is\nthe cause of the world, and Sm _ri_ ti, based on _S_ ruti, is well known.--For\nthese reasons also the Sa _n_ khya system is objectionable.\n\nHere the Sa _n_ khya again brings a countercharge--The system of the Vedantins\nalso, he says, must be declared to be objectionable; for it does not admit\nthat that which suffers and that which causes suffering 4 are different\nclasses of things (and thereby renders futile the well-established distinction\nof causes of suffering and suffering beings). For\n\np. 377\n\nthose who admit the one Brahman to be the Self of everything and the cause of\nthe whole world, have to admit also that the two attributes of being that\nwhich causes suffering and that which suffers belong to the one supreme Self\n(not to different classes of beings). If, then, these two attributes belong to\none and the same Self, it never can divest itself of them, and thus Scripture,\nwhich teaches perfect knowledge for the purpose of the cessation of all\nsuffering, loses all its meaning. For--to adduce a parallel case--a lamp as\nlong as it subsists as such is never divested of the two qualities of giving\nheat and light. And if the Vedantin should adduce the case of water with its\nwaves, ripples, foam, &c. 1, we remark that there also the waves, &c.\nconstitute attributes of the water which remain permanently, although they by\nturns manifest themselves, and again enter into the state of non-\nmanifestation; hence the water is never really destitute of waves, not any\nmore than the lamp is ever destitute of heat and light.--That that which\ncauses suffering, and that which suffers constitute different classes of\nthings is, moreover, well known from ordinary experience. For (to consider the\nmatter from a more general point of view) the person desiring and the thing\ndesired 2 are understood to be separate existences. If the object of desire\nwere not essentially different and separate from the person desiring, the\nstate of being desirous could not be ascribed to the latter, because the\nobject with reference to which alone he can be called desiring would already\nessentially be established in him (belong to him). The latter state of things\nexists in the case of a lamp and its light, for instance. Light essentially\nbelongs to the lamp, and hence the latter never can stand in want of light;\nfor want or desire can exist only if the thing wanted or desired is not yet\nobtained.\n\np. 378\n\n(And just as there could be no desiring person, if the object of desire and\nthe desiring person were not essentially separate), so the object of desire\nalso would cease to be an object for the desiring person, and would be an\nobject for itself only. As a matter of fact, however, this is not the case;\nfor the two ideas (and terms), 'object of desire' and 'desiring person,' imply\na relation (are correlative), and a relation exists in two things, not in one\nonly. Hence the desiring person and the object of desire are separate.--The\nsame holds good with regard to what is not desired (object of aversion;\nanartha) and the non-desiring person (anarthin). An object of desire is\nwhatever is of advantage to the desiring person, an object of aversion\nwhatever is of disadvantage; with both one person enters into relation by\nturns. On account of the comparative paucity of the objects of desire, and the\ncomparative multitude of the objects of aversion, both may be comprised under\nthe general term, 'object of aversion.' Now, these objects of aversion we mean\nwhen we use the term 'causes of suffering,' while by the term 'sufferer' we\nunderstand the soul which, being one, enters into successive relations with\nboth (i.e. the objects of desire and the objects of aversion). If, then, the\ncauses of suffering and the sufferer constitute one Self (as the Vedanta\nteaches), it follows that final release is impossible.--But if, on the other\nhand, the two are assumed to constitute separate classes, the possibility of\nrelease is not excluded, since the cause of the connexion of the two (viz.\nwrong knowledge) may be removed.\n\nAll this reasoning--we, the Vedantins, reply--is futile, because on account of\nthe unity of the Self the relation, whose two terms are the causes of\nsuffering, and the sufferer cannot exist (in the Self).--Our doctrine would be\nliable to your objection if that which causes suffering and that which suffers\ndid, while belonging to one and the same Self, stand to each other in the\nrelation of object and subject. But they do not stand in that relation just\nbecause they are one. If fire, although it possesses different attributes,\nsuch as heat and light, and is capable of change, does neither burn nor\nillumine itself since it is one only; how can the\n\np. 379\n\none unchangeable Brahman enter with reference to itself into the relation of\ncause of suffering and sufferer?--Where then, it may be asked, does the\nrelation discussed (which after all cannot be denied altogether) exist?--That,\nwe reply, is not difficult to see 1. The living body which is the object of\nthe action of burning is the sufferer; the sun, for instance, is a cause of\nsuffering (burning).--But, the opponent rejoins, burning is a pain, and as\nsuch can affect an intelligent being only, not the non-intelligent body; for\nif it were an affection of the mere body, it would, on the destruction of the\nbody, cease of itself, so that it would be needless to seek for means to make\nit cease.--But it is likewise not observed, we reply, that a mere intelligent\nbeing destitute of a body is burned and suffers pain.--Nor would you (the Sa\n_n_ khya) also assume that the affection called burning belongs to a mere\nintelligent being. Nor can you admit 2 a real connexion of the soul and the\nbody, because through such a connexion impurity and similar imperfections\nwould attach to the soul 3. Nor can suffering itself be said to suffer. And\nhow then, we ask, can you explain the relation existing between a sufferer and\nthe causes of suffering? If (as a last refuge) you should maintain that the\nsattva-gu _n_ a is that which suffers, and the gu _n_ a called passion that\nwhich causes suffering, we again object, because the intelligent principle\n(the soul) cannot be really connected with these two 4. And if you should say\nthat the soul suffers as it were because it leans towards 5 the sattva-gu _n_\na, we point out that the employment of the phrase, 'as it were,' shows that\nthe soul does not really suffer.\n\np. 380\n\n[paragraph continues] If it is understood that its suffering is not real, we\ndo not object to the phrase 'as it were 1.' For the amphisbena also does not\nbecome venomous because it is 'a serpent as it were' ('like a serpent'), nor\ndoes the serpent lose its venom because it is 'like an amphisbena.' You must\ntherefore admit that the relation of causes of suffering and of sufferers is\nnot real, but the effect of Nescience. And if you admit, that, then my (the\nVedantic) doctrine also is free from objections 2.\n\nBut perhaps you (the Sa _n_ khya) will say that, after all, suffering (on the\npart of the soul) is real 3. In that case, however, the impossibility of\nrelease is all the more undeniable 4, especially as the cause of suffering\n(viz. the pradhana) is admitted to be eternal.--And if (to get out of this\ndifficulty) you maintain that, although the potentialities of suffering (on\nthe part of the soul) and of causing suffering (on the part of the pradhana)\nare eternal, yet suffering, in order to become actual, requires the\nconjunction of the two--which conjunction in its turn depends on a special\nreason, viz. the non-discrimination of the pradhana by the soul--and that\nhence, when that reason no longer exists, the conjunction of the two comes to\nan absolute termination, whereby the absolute release of the soul becomes\npossible; we are again unable to accept your explanation, because that on\nwhich the non-discrimination depends, viz. the gu _n_ a, called Darkness, is\nacknowledged by you to be eternal.\n\np. 381\n\n[paragraph continues] And as  1 there is no fixed rule for the (successive)\nrising and sinking of the influence of the particular gu _n_ as, there is also\nno fixed rule for the termination of the cause which effects the conjunction\nof soul and pradhana (i.e. non-discrimination); hence the disjunction of the\ntwo is uncertain, and so the Sa _n_ khyas cannot escape the reproach of\nabsence of final release resulting from their doctrine. To the Vedantin, on\nthe other hand, the idea of final release being impossible cannot occur in his\ndreams even; for the Self he acknowledges to be one only, and one thing cannot\nenter into the relation of subject and object, and Scripture, moreover,\ndeclares that the plurality of effects originates from speech only. For the\nphenomenal world, on the other hand, we may admit the relation of sufferer and\nsuffering just as it is observed, and need neither object to it nor refute it.\n\nHerewith we have refuted the doctrine which holds the pradhana to be the cause\nof the world. We have now to dispose of the atomic theory.\n\nWe begin by refuting an objection raised by the atomists against the upholders\nof Brahman.--The Vai _s_ eshikas argue as follows: The qualities which inhere\nin the substance constituting the cause originate qualities of the same kind\nin the substance constituting the effect; we see, for instance, that from\nwhite threads white cloth is produced, but do not observe what is contrary\n(viz. white threads resulting in a piece of cloth of a different colour).\nHence, if the intelligent Brahman is assumed as the cause of the world, we\nshould expect to find intelligence inherent in the effect also, viz. the\nworld. But this is not the case, and consequently the intelligent Brahman\ncannot be the cause of the world.--This reasoning the Sutrakara shows to be\nfallacious, on the ground of the system of the Vai _s_ eshikas themselves.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[376:2](sbe34186.htm#fr_338) In the former case the five intellectual senses\nare looked upon as mere modifications of the sense of touch.\n\n[376:3](sbe34186.htm#fr_339) Buddhi in the latter case being the generic name\nfor buddhi, aha _n_ kara, and manas.\n\n[376:4](sbe34186.htm#fr_340) Lit. that which burns and that which is burned,\nwhich literal rendering would perhaps be preferable throughout. As it is, the\ncontext has necessitated its retention in some places.--The sufferers are the\nindividual souls, the cause of suffering the world in which the souls live.\n\n[377:1](sbe34186.htm#fr_341) In the case of the lamp, light and heat are\nadmittedly essential; hence the Vedantin is supposed to bring forward the sea\nwith its waves, and so on, as furnishing a case where attributes pass away\nwhile the substance remains.\n\n[377:2](sbe34186.htm#fr_342) 'Artha,' a useful or beneficial thing, an object\nof desire.\n\n[379:1](sbe34186.htm#fr_343) In reality neither suffering nor sufferers exist,\nas the Vedantin had pointed out in the first sentences of his reply; but there\ncan of course be no doubt as to who suffers and what causes suffering in the\nvyavaharika-state, i.e. the phenomenal world.\n\n[379:2](sbe34186.htm#fr_344) In order to explain thereby how the soul can\nexperience pain.\n\n[379:3](sbe34186.htm#fr_345) And that would be against the Sa _n_ khya dogma\nof the soul's essential purity.\n\n[379:4](sbe34186.htm#fr_346) So that the fact of suffering which cannot take\nplace apart from an intelligent principle again remains unexplained.\n\n[379:5](sbe34186.htm#fr_347) \xc3\x82tmanas tapte sattve pratibimitatvad yukta taptir\niti _s_ a _n_ kate sattveti. An. Gi.\n\n[380:1](sbe34186.htm#fr_348) For it then indicates no more than a fictitious\nresemblance.\n\n[380:2](sbe34186.htm#fr_349) The Sa _n_ khya Purvapakshin had objected to the\nVedanta doctrine that, on the latter, we cannot account for the fact known\nfrom ordinary experience that there are beings suffering pain and things\ncausing suffering.--The Vedantin in his turn endeavours to show that on the Sa\n_n_ khya doctrine also the fact of suffering remains inexplicable, and is\ntherefore to be considered not real, but fictitious merely, the product of\nNescience.\n\n[380:3](sbe34186.htm#fr_350) Not only 'suffering as it were,' as it had been\ncalled above.\n\n[380:4](sbe34186.htm#fr_351) For real suffering cannot be removed by mere\ndistinctive knowledge on which--according to the Sa _n_ khya also--release\ndepends.\n\n[381:1](sbe34186.htm#fr_352) This in answer to the remark that possibly the\nconjunction of soul and pradhana may come to an end when the influence of\nDarkness declines, it being overpowered by the knowledge of Truth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 11](sbe34187.htm)\n\n"
