[1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 135\n\n12:1:1\n\n# TWELFTH K\xc3\x82 _N_ _D_ A.\n\n#### THE SACRIFICIAL SESSION (SATTRA).\n\n### FIRST ADHY\xc3\x82YA. FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n12:1:1:11\\. Verily, this sacrifice is the same as this blowing (wind): it is\nthat 1 they wish to secure who take the vow of initiation for a year. Of them\nthe G _ri_ hapati is initiated first 2; for the G _ri_ hapati is this\n(terrestrial) world, and upon this world everything here is established; and\nso, indeed, are his fellow-sacrificers established in the G _ri_ hapati: it is\nthus after they have become established on a firm foundation that they are\ninitiated.\n\n12:1:1:22\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then initiates the Brahman (priest). Now the\nBrahman is the moon, and the moon is Soma, and plants belong to Soma 3: he\nthus connects the plants with this (terrestrial) world. Therefore no other\nperson should be initiated between those two; for, assuredly, were any one\nelse to be initiated between those two, he would separate (tear up) the plants\nfrom this (terrestrial) world, and they would be liable to dry up: let\ntherefore no other person be initiated between those two.\n\n12:1:1:33\\. He then initiates the Udgat _ri_. Now, the Udgat _ri_ is the\nthunder-cloud, and from the thundercloud rain is produced: he thus connects\nthe rain\n\np. 136\n\nwith the plants. Therefore no other person should be initiated between those\ntwo; for, assuredly, were any one else to be initiated between those two, he\nwould separate the rain from the plants, and (the cloud) would be liable to\nlack rain: let therefore no other person be initiated between those two.\n\n12:1:1:44\\. He then initiates the Ho tri. Now, the Hot _ri_  1 is Agni in\nrespect of the deity, and speech in respect of the body; and rain is food: he\nthus connects both Agni (fire) and speech with food. Therefore no other person\nshould be initiated between those two; for, assuredly, were any one else to be\ninitiated between those two, he would separate fire and speech from food, and\n(people) would be liable to starve: let therefore no other person be initiated\nbetween those two.\n\n12:1:1:55\\. The Pratiprasthat _ri_ then initiates the Adhvaryu. Now, the\nAdhvaryu is the mind 2, and the Hot _ri_ is speech: he thus connects mind and\nspeech with one another. Therefore no other person should be initiated between\nthose two; for, assuredly, were any one else to be initiated between those\ntwo, he would separate mind and speech, and (people) would be liable to\nperish: let therefore no other person be initiated between those two.\n\n12:1:1:66\\. He then initiates the Brahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin for the Brahman,\nfor under him the former is. He then initiates the Prastot _ri_ for the Udgat\n_ri_ , for under\n\np. 137\n\nhim the former is. He then initiates the Maitravaru _n_ a for the Hot _ri_ ,\nfor under him the former is. These four the Pratiprasthat _ri_ initiates.\n\n12:1:1:77\\. The Nesh _t_ _ri_ then initiates the Pratiprasthat _ri_ for the\nAdhvaryu, for under him the former is. It is after the fitting out 1 of these\nnine that the others are fitted out; for there are nine vital airs: he thus\nlays the vital airs into them; and so they attain the full term of life, and\nso they do not depart this world before their (full) term of life.\n\n12:1:1:88\\. He then initiates the Pot _ri_ for the Brahman, for under him the\nformer is. He then initiates the Pratihart _ri_ for the Udgat _ri_ , for under\nhim the former is. He then initiates the A _kh_ avaka for the Hot _ri_ , for\nunder him the former is. These four the Nesh _t_ _ri_ initiates.\n\n12:1:1:99\\. The Unnet _ri_ then initiates the Nesh _t_ _ri_ for the Adhvaryu,\nfor under him the former is. He then initiates the \xc3\x82gnidhra for the Brahman,\nfor under him the former is. He then initiates the Subrahma _n_ ya for the\nUdgat _ri_ , for under him the former is. He then initiates the Gravastut for\nthe Hot _ri_ , for under him the former is. These four the Unnet _ri_\ninitiates.\n\n12:1:1:1010\\. Either a Snataka 2, or a Brahma _k_ arin, or some one else who\nis not initiated, then initiates the Unnet _ri_ ; for they say, \'No pure one\nshould purify.\' This is the regular order of initiation 3;\n\np. 138\n\nand; assuredly, only when, knowing this 1, they become initiated, they make\nready the sacrifice even whilst being initiated, and along with the getting\nready of the sacrifice security of property accrues to the performers of the\nsacrificial session (Sattra); and, along with the accruing of security of\nproperty to the performers of the session, security of property also accrues\nto that district in which they perform the sacrifice.\n\n12:1:1:1111\\. Now, the Unnet _ri_ is initiated last of these, and when they\ncome out from the purificatory bath it is he that comes out first; for the\nUnnet _ri_ is the vital air: he thus lays vital air into them on both sides;\nand so they attain the full term of life, and so they do not depart this world\nbefore their (full) term of life. This is the regular order of initiation:\nand, assuredly, he should become initiated only where such as know this become\ninitiated.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[135:1](sbe44045.htm#fr_415) Viz. the wind as the vital air pervading man; see\n[paragraph 11](sbe44045.htm#12:1:1:11).\n\n[135:2](sbe44045.htm#fr_416) He, as well as the first three priests, is\ninitiated by the Adhvaryu.\n\n[135:3](sbe44045.htm#fr_417) Soma is the king of plants, whence these are\ncalled \'soma-ra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ i,\' II, 3, 4; 4; V, 4, 2, 3; _Ri_ g-veda S.
