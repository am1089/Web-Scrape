The one within (the sun and the eye) (is the highest Lord), on account of\nhis qualities being declared 3.\n\nThe following passage is found in Scripture ( _Kh_. Up. I, 6, 6 ff.), "Now\nthat person bright as gold who is seen within\n\np. 78\n\nthe sun, with beard bright as gold and hair bright as gold, bright as gold\naltogether to the very tips of his nails, whose eyes are like blue lotus; his\nname is Ut, for he has risen (udita) above all evil. He also who knows this\nrises above all evil. So much with reference to the devas.\' And further on,\nwith reference to the body, \'Now the person who is seen in the eye,\' &c. Here\nthe following doubt presents itself. Do these passages point out, as the\nobject of devotion directed on the sphere of the sun and the eye, merely some\nspecial individual soul, which, by means of a large measure of knowledge and\npious works, has raised itself to a position of eminence; or do they refer to\nthe eternally perfect highest Lord?\n\nThe purvapakshin takes the former view. An individual soul, he says, is\nreferred to, since Scripture speaks of a definite shape. To the person in the\nsun special features are ascribed, such as the possession of a beard as bright\nas gold and so on, and the same features manifestly belong to the person in\nthe eye also, since they are expressly transferred to it in the passage, \'The\nshape of this person is the same as the shape of that person.\' That, on the\nother hand, no shape can be ascribed to the highest Lord, follows from the\npassage (Kau. Up. I,3,15), \'That which is without sound, without touch,\nwithout form, without decay.\' That an individual soul is meant follows\nmoreover from the fact that a definite abode is mentioned, \'He who is in the\nsun; he who is in the eye.\' About the highest Lord, who has no special abode,\nbut abides in his own glory, no similar statement can be made; compare, for\ninstance, the two following passages, \'Where does he rest? In his own glory?\'\n( _Kh_. Up. VII, 24, 1); and \'like the ether he is omnipresent, eternal.\' A\nfurther argument for our view is supplied by the fact that the might (of the\nbeing in question) is said to be limited; for the passage, \'He is lord of the\nworlds beyond that, and of the wishes of the devas,\' indicates the\n\np. 79\n\nlimitation of the might of the person in the sun; and the passage, \'He is lord\nof the worlds beneath that and of the wishes of men,\' indicates the limitation\nof the might of the person in the eye. No limit, on the other hand, can be\nadmitted of the might of the highest Lord, as appears from the passage (B\n_ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22), \'He is the Lord of all, the king of all things, the\nprotector of all things. He is a bank and a boundary so that these worlds may\nnot be confounded;\' which passage intimates that the Lord is free from all\nlimiting distinctions. For all these reasons the person in the eye and the sun\ncannot be the highest Lord.\n\nTo this reasoning the Sutra replies, \'The one within, on account of his\nqualities being declared.\' The person referred to in the passages concerning\nthe person within the sun and the person within the eye is not a\ntransmigrating being, but the highest Lord. Why? Because his qualities are\ndeclared. For the qualities of the highest Lord are indicated in the text as\nfollows. At first the name of the person within the sun is mentioned--\'his\nname is Ut\'--and then this name is explained on the ground of that person\nbeing free from all evil, \'He has risen above all evil.\' The same name thus\nexplained is then transferred to the person in the eye, in the clause, \'the\nname of the one is the name of the other.\' Now, entire freedom from sin is\nattributed in Scripture to the highest Self only; so, for instance ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 7, 1), \'The Self which is free from sin,\' &c. Then, again, there is the\npassage, \'He is _Ri_ k, he is Saman, Uktha, Ya _g_ us, Brahman,\' which\ndeclares the person in the eye to be the Self of the _Ri_ k, Saman, and so on;\nwhich is possible only if that person is the Lord who, as being the cause of\nall, is to be considered as the Self of all. Moreover, the text, after having\nstated in succession _Ri_ k and Saman to have earth and fire for their Self\nwith reference to the Devas, and, again, speech and breath with reference to\nthe body, continues, \' _Ri_ k and Saman are his joints,\' with reference to the\nDevas, and \'the joints of the one are the joints of the other,\' with reference\nto the body. Now this statement\n\np. 80\n\nalso can be made only with regard to that which is the Self of all. Further,\nthe passage, \'Therefore all who sing to the Vina sing him, and from him also\nthey obtain wealth,\' shows that the being spoken of is the sole topic of all\nworldly songs; which again holds true of the highest Lord only. That absolute\ncommand over the objects of worldly desires (as displayed, for instance, in\nthe bestowal of wealth) entitles us to infer that the Lord is meant, appears\nalso from the following passage of the Bhagavadgita (X, 41), \'Whatever being\nthere is possessing power, glory, or strength, know it to be produced from a\nportion of my energy 1.\' To the objection that the statements about bodily\nshape contained in the clauses, \'With a beard bright as gold,\' &c., cannot\nrefer to the highest Lord, we reply that the highest Lord also may, when he\npleases, assume a bodily shape formed of Maya, in order to gratify thereby his\ndevout worshippers. Thus Sm _ri_ ti also says, \'That thou seest me, O Narada,\nis the Maya emitted by me; do not then look on me as endowed with the\nqualities of all beings.\' We have further to note that expressions such as,\n\'That which is without sound, without touch, without form, without decay,\' are\nmade use of where instruction is given about the nature of the highest Lord in\nso far as he is devoid of all qualities; while passages such as the following\none, \'He to whom belong all works, all desires, all sweet odours and tastes\' (\n_Kh_. Up. III, 14, 2), which represent the highest Lord as the object of\ndevotion, speak of him, who is the cause of everything, as possessing some of\nthe qualities of his effects. Analogously he may be spoken of, in the passage\nunder discussion, as having a beard bright as gold and so on. With reference\nto the objection that the highest Lord cannot be meant because an abode is\nspoken of, we remark that, for the purposes of devout meditation, a special\nabode may be assigned to Brahman, although it abides in its own glory only;\nfor as Brahman is, like ether, all-pervading, it may be viewed as\n\np. 81\n\nbeing within the Self of all beings. The statement, finally, about the\nlimitation of Brahman\'s might, which depends on the distinction of what\nbelongs to the gods and what to the body, has likewise reference to devout\nmeditation only. From all this it follows that the being which Scripture\nstates to be within the eye and the sun is the highest Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[77:3](sbe34026.htm#fr_119) The preceding adhikara _n_ a had shown that the\nfive Selfs (consisting of food, mind, and so on), which the Taitt. Up.\nenumerates, are introduced merely for the purpose of facilitating the\ncognition of Brahman considered as devoid of all qualities; while that Brahman\np. 78 itself is the real object of knowledge. The present adhikara _n_ a\nundertakes to show that the passage about the golden person represents the\nsavi _s_ esha Brahman as the object of devout meditation.\n\n[80:1](sbe34026.htm#fr_120) So that the real giver of the gifts bestowed by\nprinces on poets and singers is Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 21](sbe34027.htm)\n\n'
