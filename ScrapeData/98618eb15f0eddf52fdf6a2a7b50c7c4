Let your voice-born [1](sbe3244.htm#an_5:87:1:1) prayers go forth to the\ngreat Vish _n_ u, accompanied by the Maruts, Evayamarut, and to the chasing\nhost, adorned with good rings, the strong, in their jubilant throng, to the\nshouting power (of the Maruts).\n\n2\\. O Maruts, you who are born great, and proclaim it yourselves by knowledge,\nEvayamarut, that power of yours cannot be approached by wisdom, that (power)\nof theirs (cannot be approached) by gift or might\n[1](sbe3244.htm#an_5:87:2:1); they are like unapproachable mountains.\n\n3\\. They who are heard with their voice from the high heaven, the brilliant\nand strong, Evayamarut, in whose council no tyrant\n[1](sbe3244.htm#an_5:87:3:1) reigns, the rushing chariots\n[2](sbe3244.htm#an_5:87:3:2) of these roaring Maruts come forth\n[3](sbe3244.htm#an_5:87:3:3), like fires with their own lightning.\n\n4\\. The wide-striding (Vish _n_ u) [1](sbe3244.htm#an_5:87:4:1) strode forth\nfrom the great common seat, Evayamarut. When he has started by himself from\nhis own place along the ridges, O ye striving, mighty\n[2](sbe3244.htm#an_5:87:4:2) Maruts, he goes together with the heroes (the\nMaruts), conferring blessings.\n\n5\\. Impetuous, like your own shout, the strong one (Vish _n_ u) made\neverything tremble, the terrible, the wanderer [1](sbe3244.htm#an_5:87:5:1),\nthe mighty, Evayamarut; strong with him you advanced self-luminous, with firm\nreins, golden coloured, well-armed [2](sbe3244.htm#an_5:87:5:2), speeding\nalong.\n\n6\\. Your greatness is infinite, ye Maruts, endowed\n\np. 364\n\nwith full power, may that terrible power help, Evayamarut. In your raid\n[1](sbe3244.htm#an_5:87:6:1) you are indeed to be seen as charioteers; deliver\nus therefore from the enemy, like shining fires.\n\n7\\. May then these Rudras, lively like fires and with vigorous shine, help,\nEvayamarut. The seat of the earth is stretched out far and wide\n[1](sbe3244.htm#an_5:87:7:1), when the hosts of these faultless Maruts come\nquickly to the races.\n\n8\\. Come kindly on your path, O Maruts, listen to the call of him who praises\nyou, Evayamarut. Confidants of the great Vish _n_ u, may you together, like\ncharioteers, keep all hateful things far [1](sbe3244.htm#an_5:87:8:1), by your\nwonderful skill.\n\n9\\. Come zealously [1](sbe3244.htm#an_5:87:9:1) to our sacrifice, ye\nworshipful, hear our guileless call, Evayamarut. Like the oldest mountains in\nthe sky, O wise guardians, prove yourselves for him irresistible to the enemy.\n\np. 365\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is evidently a later addition at the end of the fifth Ma _n_ _d_\nala. It is addressed to the Maruts, and is ascribed to Evayamarut \xc3\x82treya. None\nof its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., MS., except the first, which\nis found in SV. I, 462. Metre, Ati _g_ agati.\n\nThe name of the poet is due to the refrain Evaya\xc2\xb4marut which occurs in every\nverse, and sometimes as an integral portion of the verse. Evaya\xc2\xb4marut is a\nsacrificial shout, much like \xce\x95\xe1\xbd\x90\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\x96 in Greek, Evoe in Latin, though I do not\nmean to say that the two are identical. Evaya _h_ , as I explained in note to\nI, 168, 1, is an epithet of Vish _n_ u, as well as of the Maruts, meaning\nquickly moving. Evayamarut, therefore, may mean the 'quick Marut.' This is\nstrange, no doubt, because in the Rig-veda the Maruts always occur in the\nplural, except in some doubtful passages. Still Evayamarut, the quick Marut,\nmight be a name of Vish _n_ u. It cannot be taken as a Dvandva, Vish _n_ u and\nthe Maruts.\n\nThis hymn was translated by Benfey in his glossary to the Sama-veda, p. 39.\nBenfey takes evaya as identical with \xce\xb5\xe1\xbd\x90\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\x96, and explains it as an adverbial\ninstrumental, like a _s_ uya, in the sense of sturmisch. But this would leave\nevayavan unexplained.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Giri ga\xc2\xb4 _h_ may mean 'produced on the mountains,' but it may also\nmean 'produced in the throat or voice,' and it is so explained elsewhere, for\ninstance in SV. I, 462 (Bibl. Ind., vol. i, p. 922). girau va _k_ i nishpanna\n_h_ ; [also by another commentator, h _ri_ daye _g_ ata, ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _g_ ata\nva ity uktam]. Oldenberg suggests giri _g_ e, which would be much better,\nconsidering how Vish _n_ u is called girikshit, girish _th_ a, &c.; see\nBergaigne, II, 47. Most of the epithets have occurred before. I take _s_ avase\nas a substantive, like _s_ ardhas, not as an adjective. As to dhunivrata, see\nV, 58, 2; as to praya _g_ yu, V, 55, I.\n\np. 366\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Kratva, dana\xc2\xb4, and mahna\xc2\xb4 seem to me in this place to belong together.\nThe difficulty lies in the transition from va _h_ to esham, but this is not\nuncommon. On mahina\xc2\xb4 = mahimna, dana\xc2\xb4, and mahna\xc2\xb4, see Wenzel, Instrumentalis,\np. 17; Lanman, p. 533. Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 101, translates, 'Ihre Macht\ngereicht ihnen zu grosser Gabe.' See also VIII, 20, 14. _G_ ata\xc2\xb4 _h_ mahina\xc2\xb4,\nborn by greatness, seems to mean born in greatness, or born great. It would be\neasy to write mahina _h_.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The translation of iri is purely conjectural.\n\nNote 2. Syandra\xc2\xb4sa _h_ , as suggested by Oldenberg, are probably meant for\nratha _h_. Syandana is a carriage in later Sanskrit. In VIII, 20, 2, we have\nto supply rathai _h_ ; in VI, 66, 2, ratha _h_.\n\nNote 3. Pra, with the verb understood, they come forth; cf. VII, 87, 1. pra ar\n_n_ a _m_ si samudriya nadi\xc2\xb4nam; X, 75, 1. Dhuni, like dhuti, has become\nalmost a name of the Maruts, see I, 64, 5.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The god here meant seems to be Vish _n_ u, mentioned already in verse\n1, and probably recalled by the Evaya in Evayamarut.\n\nNote 2. 'We must either take vispardhasa _h_ and vimahasa _h_ with Benfey as\nnames of the horses, or accept them as vocatives, addressed to the Maruts.\nVimahas is used as an epithet of the Maruts, see I, 86, 1.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. On yayi _h_ , see note to I, 87, 2; but it seems better to take it\nhere as an adjective.\n\nNote 2. On svayudha, see Geldner, Ved. Stud. I, p. 143; Oldenberg, Gott. Gel.\nAnzeigen, 1890, p. 424.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Prasiti may be, as Ludwig translates it, fangschnur, a noose, but it\ncan hardly mean Noth, as Grassmann\n\np. 367\n\nsuggests. I take it here in the sense of shooting forth, onslaught, raid; cf.\nVII, 46, 4. Geldner, Ved. Stud. I, p. 139, takes it for a trap. Lanman, p.\n386, is right in considering the locative in au before consonants a sure sign\nof the modern origin of this hymn.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. The idea that the earth is stretched out or becomes large during a\nthunderstorm has been met with before, V, 58, 7. We read I, 37, 8; 87, 3, that\nat the racings of the Maruts the earth trembled, and that the Maruts enlarged\nthe fences in their races. I therefore translate, though tentatively only,\nthat the earth is opened far and wide, as a race-course for the faultless\nMaruts, whose hosts a\xc2\xb4, appear, a _g_ meshu, on the courses, maha _h_ ,\nquickly. If the accent of paprathe could be changed, we might translate, 'at\nwhose coursings (a _g_ meshu a\xc2\xb4) the seat of the earth is quickly stretched\nout far and wide,' and then take _s_ ardha _m_ si adbhutainasam in apposition\nto rudra\xc2\xb4sa _h_. Adbhutainas, in whom no fault is seen.\n\nBergaigne translates, 'faisant du mal mysterieusement.' See Geldner, in K. Z.\nXXVIII, 199, Anm. 2; Bezzenberger's Beitrage, III, 169.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Cf. VI, 48, 10.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Su _s_ ami, generally explained as a shortened instrumental, for su\n_s_ ami = su _s_ amya, used in an adverbial sense. Su _s_ ami has a short i\nhere, because it stands at the end of a pada, otherwise the i is long, see\nVII, 16, 2; X, 28, 12, even before a vowel. The same applies in the Rig-veda\nto _s_ ami; it has short i at the end of a pada, see II, 31, 6; VIII, 45, 27;\nX, 40, 1. The phrase dhiya\xc2\xb4 _s_ ami, which has short i in II, 31, 6; X, 40, 1,\nhas long i in IX, 74, 7. dhiya\xc2\xb4 _s_ ami. It is shortened, however, before\nvowels in the middle of a pada, and written _s_ amy; see I, 87, 5; III, 55, 3.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 66. To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)](sbe3245.htm)\n\n"
