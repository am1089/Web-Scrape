Enough of this tedious work, which fritters away the\ninterest of the audience! Let me then most reverently salute the honorable\ngentlemen, and announce our intention to produce a drama called "The Little\nClay Cart." Its author was a man\n\nWho vied with elephants in lordly grace;  \n  Whose eyes were those of the chakora bird  \nThat feeds on moonbeams; glorious his face  \n  As the full moon; his person, all have heard,  \nWas altogether lovely. First in worth  \n  Among the twice-born was this poet, known  \nAs Sh\xc5\xabdraka far over all the earth,\xc2\x97  \n  His virtue\'s depth unfathomed and alone.3\n\np. 2\n\nAnd again:\n\nThe S\xc4\x81maveda, the Rigveda too,  \nThe science mathematical, he knew;  \nThe arts wherein fair courtezans excel,  \nAnd all the lore of elephants as well.  \nThrough Shiva\'s grace, his eye was never dim;  \nHe saw his son a king in place of him.  \nThe difficult horse-sacrifice he tried  \nSuccessfully; entered the fiery tide,  \nOne hundred years and ten days old, and died.4\n\nAnd yet again:\n\nEager for battle; sloth\'s determined foe;  \n  Of scholars chief, who to the Veda cling;  \nRich in the riches that ascetics know;  \nGlad, gainst the foeman\'s elephant to show  \n  His valor;\xc2\x97such was Sh\xc5\xabdraka, the king.5\n\nAnd in this work of his,\n\nWithin the town, Avanti named,  \nDwells one called Ch\xc4\x81rudatta, famed  \nNo less for youth than poverty;  \nA merchant\'s son and Brahman, he.\n\nHis virtues have the power to move  \nVasantasen\xc4\x81\'s inmost love;  \nFair as the springtime\'s radiancy,  \nAnd yet a courtezan is she.6\n\nSo here king Sh\xc5\xabdraka the tale imparts  \nOf love\'s pure festival in these two hearts,  \nOf prudent acts, a lawsuit\'s wrong and hate,  \nA rascal\'s nature, and the course of fate.7\n\n[ _He walks about and looks around him_.] Why, this music-room of ours is\nempty. I wonder where the actors have gone. [ _Reflecting_.] Ah, I understand.\n\np. 3\n\nEmpty his house, to whom no child was born;  \n  Thrice empty his, who lacks true friends and sure;  \nTo fools, the world is empty and forlorn;  \n  But all that is, is empty to the poor.8\n\nI have finished the concert. And I\'ve been practising so long that the pupils\nof my eyes are dancing, and I\'m so hungry that my eyes are crackling like a\nlotus-seed, dried up by the fiercest rays of the summer sun. I\'ll just call my\nwife and ask whether there is anything for breakfast or not.\n\nHello! here I am\xc2\x97but no! Both the particular occasion and the general custom\ndemand that I speak Pr\xc4\x81krit. [ _Speaking in Pr \xc4\x81krit_.] Confound it! I\'ve been\npractising so long and I\'m so hungry that my limbs are as weak as dried-up\nlotus-stalks. Suppose I go home and see whether my good wife has got anything\nready or not. [ _He walks about and looks around him_.] Here I am at home.\nI\'ll just go in. [ _He enters and looks about_.] Merciful heavens! Why in the\nworld is everything in our house turned upside down? A long stream of rice-\nwater is flowing down the street. The ground, spotted black where the iron\nkettle has been rubbed clean, is as lovely as a girl with the beauty-marks of\nblack cosmetic on her face. It smells so good that my hunger seems to blaze up\nand hurts me more than ever. Has some hidden treasure come to light? or am I\nhungry enough to think the whole world is made of rice? There surely isn\'t any\nbreakfast in our house, and I\'m starved to death. But everything seems\ntopsyturvy here. One girl is preparing cosmetics, another is weaving garlands\nof flowers. [ _Reflecting_.] What does it all mean? Well, I\'ll call my good\nwife and learn the truth. [ _He looks toward the dressing-room_.] Mistress,\nwill you come here a moment?\n\n[ _Enter an actress_.]\n\n_Actress_. Here I am, sir.\n\n_Director_. You are very welcome, mistress.\n\n_Actress_. Command me, sir. What am I to do?\n\np. 4\n\n_Director_. Mistress, I\'ve been practising so long and I\'m so hungry that my\nlimbs are as weak as dried-up lotus-stalks. Is there anything to eat in the\nhouse or not?\n\n_Actress_. There\'s everything, sir.\n\n_Director_. Well, what?\n\n_Actress_. For instance\xc2\x97there\'s rice with sugar, melted butter, curdled milk,\nrice; and, all together, it makes you a dish fit for heaven. May the gods\nalways be thus gracious to you!\n\n_Director_. All that in our house? or are you joking?\n\n_Actress_. [ _Aside_.] Yes, I will have my joke. [ _Aloud_.] It\'s in the\nmarket-place, sir.\n\n_Director_. [ _Angrily_.] You wretched woman, thus shall your own hope be cut\noff! And death shall find you out! For my expectations, like a scaffolding,\nhave been raised so high, only to fall again.\n\n_Actress_. Forgive me, sir, forgive me! It was only a joke.\n\n_Director_. But what do these unusual preparations mean? One girl is preparing\ncosmetics, another is weaving garlands, and the very ground is adorned with\nsacrificial flowers of five different colors.\n\n_Actress_. This is a fast day, sir.\n\n_Director_. What fast?\n\n_Actress_. The fast for a handsome husband.\n\n_Director_. In this world, mistress, or the next?\n\n_Actress_. In the next world, sir.\n\n_Director_. [ _Wrathfully_.] Gentlemen! look at this. She is sacrificing my\nfood to get herself a husband in the next world.\n\n_Actress_. Don\'t be angry, sir. I am fasting in the hope that you may be my\nhusband in my next birth, too.\n\n_Director_. But who suggested this fast to you?\n\n_Actress_. Your own dear friend J\xc5\xabrnavriddha.\n\n_Director_. [ _Angrily_.] Ah, J\xc5\xabrnavriddha, son of a slave-wench! When, oh,\nwhen shall I see King P\xc4\x81laka angry with you? Then\n\np. 5\n\nyou will be parted, as surely as the scented hair of some young bride.\n\n_Actress_. Don\'t be angry, sir. It is only that I may have you in the next\nworld that I celebrate this fast. [ _She falls at his feet_.]\n\n_Director_. Stand up, mistress, and tell me who is to officiate at this fast.\n\n_Actress_. Some Brahman of our own sort whom we must invite.\n\n_Director_. You may go then. And I will invite some Brahman of our own sort.\n\n_Actress_. Very well, sir.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\n_Director_. [ _Walking about_.] Good heavens! In this rich city of Ujjayin\xc4\xab\nhow am I to find a Brahman of our own sort? [ _He looks about him_.] Ah, here\ncomes Ch\xc4\x81rudatta\'s friend Maitreya. Good! I\'ll ask him. Maitreya, you must be\nthe first to break bread in our house to-day.\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. You must invite some other Brahman. I am busy.\n\n_Director_. But, man, the feast is set and you have it all to yourself.\nBesides, you shall have a present.\n\n_The voice_. I said no once. Why should you keep on urging me?\n\n_Director_. He says no. Well, I must invite some other Brahman.\n\n[ _Exit_.\n\nEND OF THE PROLOGUE\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act the First: The Gems Are Left Behind](lcc07.htm)\n\n'
