Krishnu gave his consent; and upon this, Bulram took leave\nof them all, carrying a ploughshare and pestle; and mounting his chariot,\nstarted off.\n\nO great king! the Rajas of all the cities, towns and villages, Bulram Jee\npassed through, came out to welcome him, and escorted him with the greatest\npoliteness; and he offered consolation to each of them. After some days\'\njourney, Bulram Jee arrived at the city of Awuntika; he paid his respects to\nthe spiritual preceptor, who had instructed him in knowledge, and stayed about\nten days with him. On taking leave of his preceptor, Buldeo Jee went on to\nGokool, and beheld the cows every where in the jungle with their\n\np. 331\n\nmouths open, not having eaten any grass, thinking of Shree Krishnu Chund,\ntheir minds wrapt up in the tones of his lute, wandering about lowing and\npanting; and behind them the  cowherds\' children singing Huri\'s praises, and\nimbued with affection for him, were going along; and on all sides the\ninhabitants of the city were commending Krishnu\'s exploits and sports. Seeing\nthis condition of the inhabitants and of the cows, on arrival at his birth-\nplace, Bulram took compassion upon them, and his eyes filled with tears; all\nthe cowherds\' [children](errata.htm#18) came running out, when they saw the\nflag and banner on the chariot, supposing that Shree Krishnu Chund and Bulram\nhad come. Bulram descended from his ruth at their approach, and embraced and\nbegan to make the kindest enquiries from each of them; in the mean while, some\none told Nund and Jusodha, "That Buldeo had arrived." On hearing the news,\nNund and Jusodha, and the cowherds rose and rushed out. Bulram, when he saw\nthem from a distance coming towards him, ran and threw himself at the feet of\nNund Rae; then Nund Jee shedding tears of joy, raised Bulram, and embraced him\nwith the utmost affection, and forgot all the pains of separation; Bulram then\nwent and laid hold of Jusodha\'s feet, who fondly clasped him to her bosom, she\nembraced and clung \'to his neck, tears streaming from her eyes.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja,\n--O great king! after this interview, Nund Rae Jee took Bulram into the house,\nand began to make kind enquiries, asking "If Oogursen and Basoodeo, and the\nJudoos, and Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy, were all well. Do they ever\nthink of us?" Bulram said, "Through your favour, they are all well and happy,\nand constantly sing of your good qualities." Nund Rae was silent when he heard\nthis; then the Ranee Jusodha, tears filling her eyes as she thought of\nKrishnu, said with great emotion, "Buldeo Jee! is Shree Krishnu, the star of\nmy eyes, well?" Bulram\n\np. 332\n\nreplied, "That he was quite well." Jusodha then began to say, "Buldeo! since\nHuri went hence, there has been a darkness before my eyes; and I think of him\nconstantly, day and night, (during the eight puhurs)--and he has entirely\nforgotten me, and gone and taken up his abode at Dwarka; and behold, my\nsisters, Dewukee and Rohnee, have also relinquished all affection for me,\nconsider Gokool as near Muttra; you have thought hitherto that we lived at a\ndistance, Huri would come to see us and pay us visit; but they, (that is,\nRohnee and Dewukee) have arranged that he shall not have another interview\nwith us."\n\nO great king! when having thus spoken, Jusodha was in a state of the greatest\nagitation, and began to weep, Bulram Jee entered into explanations with her,\nand made her understand how matters really stood; and inspired her with\nconfidence; afterwards when he had taken refreshment, and eaten pawn, and came\nout of the house, he saw that all the women of Bruj were emaciated and\ndesponding with dishevelled hair, a dirty appearance, depressed in spirits,\nneglecting their domestic affairs, deeply in love, in the highest excitement\nof youthful desire, singing the good qualities of Huri, restless at his\nabsence, and going about in every direction like drunken persons.\n\nO great king! on seeing Bulram, they came running to him with the greatest\ndelight; and making obeisance, surrounded him on all sides; and with joined\nhands, began to question him, and say, "Tell us, O Bulram! the abode of\nhappiness, where does our soul, the lovely Krishnu, now dwell? Does Beharee\never think of us, or has he forgotten all his former love, since he obtained a\nthrone? Since he went hence, he has once sent us a message through Oodho to\nperform penance; and has taken no further thought of any one; "and as he has\nnow gone to take up his abode in the sea, why should he make enquiries about\nany of us?" On hearing these words, one of the cowherdesses said, "Friend! who\nwould regret the love of Huri, after seeing the manner he\n\np. 333\n\nhas treated us all? He is not beloved by any one, he who has turned his back\nupon his father and mother; he does not remain an hour without Radha, and it\nis she, who has made him stay away; again what have you and I gained by\nleaving our homes, sacrificing all respect for our families, and for the\nworld, abandoning our sons and husbands, and fixing our affections upon Huri;\nhaving embarked us on the boat of love, he has altogether left us in the midst\nof the sea of separation; and we hear, that Krishnu has now gone to Dwarka,\nand contracted many marriages; and that he has also married sixteen thousand\none hundred and eight Rajas\' daughters, whom Bhomasoor had kept confined. They\nhave had sons and grandsons, why should he leave them and come here?" Another\ncowherdess said, "Friend! do not regret in any way on account of the reports\nabout Huri, because Oodho Jee came and mentioned all his good qualities." She\nagain said, "Friends! act now according to my suggestion--let us, having been\nallowed to touch the feet of Bulram, continue to sing in praise of his good\nqualities. He is fair, and not of black-coloured body, he will not practise\ndeceit." Bulram said in reply, "I have made this journey for your sakes. I\nhave come here to tell you; and for this purpose Krishnu sent me to Bruj; I\nwill stay two months with you, and dance the circular dance, and fulfil all\nyour, expectations."\n\nO great king! Bulram Jee, having thus spoken, gave a command to the women of\nBruj, "As this is the night of the full moon of Chuetru, adorn yourselves, and\ngo into the forest; and I will engage in festive songs and dance with you."\nHaving thus said, Bulram Jee went in the evening to the forest, and all the\nwomen of Bruj followed him, wearing elegant dresses, and ornaments? and\nadorned from head to foot, came to Buldeo, they all remained bending their\nheads. The beauty of Buldeo cannot be described; of the colour of gold, he was\ndressed in a blue dress; his moon\n\np. 334\n\nlike countenance and lotus eyes captivated all hearts; a ear-ring shone with\nlustrous beauty in one of his ears; as though the sun and moon dwelt together;\nthe other ear had drank of the flavour of the celebrity of Huri; and he  did\nnot fasten an ear-ring in it. Jewels in profusion were fastened on all parts\nof his body, the splendour of which baffles description. The women fell at his\nfeet, saying, "Engage in sports and delightful festive songs and dances with\nus."\n\nO great king! on hearing this request, Bulram Jee made the mystical sound of "\n_hoon_ ," on uttering which, all the materials, necessary for the festival\nwere immediately produced. The cowherdesses then abandoning all care and\nmodesty, giving themselves up to the passion of love, began to sing and play\nupon lutes, drums, cymbals, pipes and other musical instruments of all kinds,\nand gratify Bulram by their merrymaking and dancing, and blandishments.\n\nOn hearing them play and sing, and seeing them dance, Buldeo Jee was\ndelighted; and, having drank some spirituous liquor, began to sing and dance,\nand engage in every kind of sport, and enjoy mutual pleasure; at that time the\ngods, celestial musicians and choristers, and the demi-gods, accompanied by\ntheir wives, and sitting in chariots, singing the praises of Bulram, rained\nflowers from the sky. The moon and the assembly of the stars, beholding the\nhappiness of the festive assembly, poured down nectar from their rays, the air\nbecame still, and the course of water was stopped.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! in this manner Bulram Jee engaged at night in festive songs and dances\nwith the women of Bruj, during the months of Chuetru and Bysakh, and in the\nday-time made Nund and Jusodha happy by relating the history of Huri. One\nnight, whilst engaging in festivities, Bulram Jee having gone and reposed on\nthe banks of the river, said angrily, "Jumna! flow thou here, and forming a\nthousand streams,\n\np. 335\n\nbathe me with thy waters; if thou obeyest not my command, thy waters shall be\ndivided into several portions." When, O great king, the Jumna through pride\nwould not attend to what Bulram Jee said, he drew her towards him with his\nplough and bathed, and from that day the Jumna has been bent at that spot.\nHaving bathed and got rid of all his fatigue, Bulram Jee made all the\ncowherdesses happy; and, taking them with him, went from the forest to the\ncity; there the cowherdesses said, "O lord of the Judoos, take us hence with\nyou."\n\nHaving heard this request, Bulram Jee encouraged the hopes of the\ncowherdesses; and, having inspired them with confidence, allowed them to take\nleave, and went himself to take leave of Nund and Jusodha. He then explained\nto them and gave them comfort also; and after a stay of some days took leave,\nand set off for Dwarka, where he soon arrived.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXVII](psa68.htm)\n\n'
