Vyasa said :-- O king! When the war was declared, the two kings, excited\nby greed and anger, took up arms; and a dreadful encounter ensued.\n\n\n\n2\\. On one side the king Yudhajit of long arms, surrounded by his own army,\nwith bows and arrows came ready to fight.\n\n\n\n3\\. On the other hand, the fiery Virasena, the second God of the Devas\nappeared in the battle, following a true K _s_ attriya custom, on behalf his\ndaughter\xc2\x92s son.\n\n\n\n4\\. Then that truthful king Virasena, seeing Yudhajit in battle, became very\nangry and hurled arrows on him, as a cloud rains on the mountain tops.\n\n\n\n5\\. On being covered, as it were, by the sharp and swift arrows, sharpened on\na stone slab hurled at him by Virasena, Yudhajit, too, quickly, shot arrows at\nVirasena and cut off all his arrows.\n\n\n\n6\\. O King! A dreadful fight then ensued between the cavalries, the warriors\non the elephants; and the Devas, men, and Munis began to witness this terrible\nbattle with wonder and astonishment. Birds, vultures and crows, desirous to\neat the flesh of the dead soldiers, flew in the air.\n\n\n\n7\\. Blood of elephants, horses and warriors, the bodies that lay dead, flowed\nin torrents awfully like rivers in that deadly battle ground. The torrent of\nblood excited fear amongst those who came to see it, as the river Vaitara _n_\ni on the way to hell (the Lord of Death) is very fearful to the sinners.\n\n\n\np. 179\n\n\n\n8\\. The human skulls were driven ashore by the current and they look like so\nmany hollow shells of gourds scattered there for the play of the boys on the\nbanks of the Jumna.\n\n\n\n9\\. When any warrior lay dead on the field, the vultures began to fly about in\nthe air for devouring his flesh. It seemed then that the soul of the warrior\nbeholding his beautiful body tried to reenter into his body, though he thought\nthat it had become very inaccessible to him.\n\n\n\n10\\. Some warriors on being slain in the battle instantly arose in a celestial\ncar to the heavens and was seen addressing the celestial nymph, who came\nalready within his embrace, thus \xc2\x93O one of beautiful thighs. Behold! how my\nbeautiful body is lying on the earth below!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n11\\. Another warrrior thus slain got up in the heavens on a celestial car,\ncame in possession of a celestial nymph and when he was sitting with her in\nthe car, his former wife in the earth made herself a sati and burnt herself up\nin the funeral pyre, thus got a celestial body, came up to the heavens; and\nthat chaste virtuous woman drew away perforce her own husband away from that\ncelestial nymph.\n\n\n\n12\\. Two warriors, went up, slew each other and lay down dead at the same\ntime. They went up in the heavens at the same time and there began quarrel\nwith each other and fight with their weapons for one and the same celestial\nnymph.\n\n\n\n13\\. Some hero got in the heavens a nymph more lovely and beautiful than\nhimself and he thus became very much attached and devoted her. He began to\ndescribe his own heroic qualities and also to copy dotedly the qualities of\nhis lover so that she might remain faithfully attached to him.\n\n\n\n14\\. The dust, arising from the dreadful encounter of the soldiers in battle\nfield, rose up in the air and covered the sun. It appeared night. After a\nwhile that dust became absorbed in the blood below, and the sun appeared very\nred, reflected with the colour of the blood.\n\n\n\n15\\. Some Brahmachari fought in the battle and was slain. He went up to the\nheavens; instantly a lovely eyed Devakanya, a celestial nymph desired to\nselect him as bridegroom with great devotion. But that clever man did not\naccept the offer, thinking that his vow of Brahmacharya would be thus broken.\n\n\n\n16-17. O King! Thus when the battle was deadly, the king Yudhajit shot a\nsharp, dreadful arrow at Virasena and severed his head from body. Virasena lay\ndead on the battle field and his army was routed. The soldiers fled away from\nthe battle.\n\n\n\np. 180\n\n\n\n18-19. Hearing that her father was slain in the battle, Manorama became very\nterrified and anxious. She then began to think that the vicious wicked king\nYudhajit will surely slay her son, for kingdom's sake and to satisfy his\nenmity with her father.\n\n\n\n20\\. What shall I do now? My father is slain in the battle. My husband is no\nmore. My child is a minor to-day. Where shall I go?\n\n\n\n21\\. Greed is very sinful; who is there that cannot be bought over by love of\ngold? and what vicious act can there be, that cannot be done when actuated by\ncovetousness?\n\n\n\n22\\. A greedy man does not hesitate to kill his father, mother, spiritual\nguide, friends and others. There is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n23\\. It is the inordinate love of worldly things that makes a man eat what is\nheld unclean in society, that makes a man approach a woman who is\nunapproachable, and it is greed that makes a man discard his own religion and\nbecome an apostate.\n\n\n\n24\\. In this city I find none so powerful as I can remain there under his\nshelter and be able to rear up my child.\n\n\n\n25\\. What can I do if the king Yudhajit slay my son? There is none in this\nworld who can save me, and, counting on whose shelter, I can stay here without\nany anxiety.\n\n\n\n26\\. And this my co-rival wife Lilavati will always practise enmity with me.\nShe will never shew mercy on my son.\n\n\n\n27\\. When Yudhajit will arrive in this city, I will never be able to go out of\nit and he will to-day put my son in the prison on the pretext that he is a\nminor.\n\n\n\n28-29. I heard that, in days of yore, Indra entered into the womb of his\npregnant step mother with a small thunderbolt in his hand and divided the\nfoetus into seven parts with that weapon, again each of these seven into seven\nparts again, thus the forty nine Maruts were born in the Heavens.\n\n\n\n30-31. I heard also that in ancient times one queen gave poison to destroy the\nfoetus in the womb of her rival wife. When the child came out of the womb, he\nwas celebrated by the name of Sagara (with poison) in this earth.\n\n\n\n32\\. The husband was alive, and still his queen Kaikeyi banished the eldest\nson of his king, S\xc2\x92ri Ramchandra to the forest; and the king Das\xc2\x92aratha\nsacrificed his life for that very reason.\n\n\n\n33\\. The ministers no doubt wanted before to install my son as the king; but\nnow they are not independent; they have now yielded themselves to the king\nYudhajit.\n\n\n\np. 181\n\n\n\n34\\. There is no brother of mine powerful enough to release me from my\nbondage; I see I have fallen into a great difficulty by the combination of\nunforeseen circumstances.\n\n\n\n35\\. Though the success depends on Fate, still one should make an earnest\neffort. If one does not make any effort, fate also remains asleep. I will\ntherefore soon make out a plan to save my son.\n\n\n\n36-38. O King! Thinking thus, that woman Manorama called in private the best\nand very respectable minister Vidalla, who was intelligent and expert in\neverything, and holding the hands of her son and weeping, said humbly in a\ndepressed spirit \xc2\x93O Minister! My father is slain in the battle field, this my\nson is a minor, and Yudhajit is a powerful king; consider all these and tell\nme what I should do now?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n39-40. The venerable minister Vidalla then said to the queen Manorama \xc2\x93It is\nnever advisable for us to stay here. Soon we will go into the forests of\nBenares. There I have got my powerful uncle Subahu. He is prosperous and has\ngot a strong army. He will protect us.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n41\\. \xc2\x93I will make the pretext that I am become very anxious for the king and\ntherefore I am going out to see the king Yudhajit and will go out of the city\nin my chariot. There is no doubt in this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n42-43. Hearing, thus, the Vidalla's words, the queen Manorama went to Lilavati\nand said \xc2\x93O faireyed! To-day I am going to see the father Yudhajit.\xc2\x94 Thus\nsaying, she went out of the city in a chariot, accompanied by her son,\nattendants and Vidalla.\n\n\n\n44-45. Grieved at the loss of her father, fearful, distressed, and fatigued,\nManorama saw Yudhajit and performed the cremation of her father Virasena; and,\ntrembling with fear, got to the banks of the Ganges after two days\xc2\x92 swift\njourney.\n\n\n\n46-48. There the robbers, the Nisadas plundered all their riches and took the\nchariot and went away. Manorama had only her clothings, that she wore, left to\nher. She began to weep, and, holding the hands of her attendant, went to the\nGanges shore, and being afraid crossed the river on a raft and went to the\nChitraku _t_ a mountain.\n\n\n\n49\\. That terrified Devi went to the hermitage of Bharadvaja as early as\npossible. There she saw the ascetics and was relieved of her fear.\n\n\n\n50\\. Bharadvaja asked, \xc2\x93O lotus eyed! Who are you and whose wife are you? Why\nhave you taken so much trouble to come here? Answer all these truly.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n51\\. \xc2\x93O beautiful one! are you a Devi or a human being? your son is a very\nminor. Why have you come in this dense forest? It seems, as if you are\ndeprived of your kingdom.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 182\n\n\n\n52\\. Thus asked by the best of the Munis, the beautiful Manorama became very\nmuch afflicted with grief and began to weep; she could not speak anything\nherself and ordered Vidalla to inform the Muni all what had happened.\n\n\n\n53-54. Vidalla then said :-- There was a king of Kosala, named Dhruvasandhi.\nShe is the legal wife of that king. Her name is Manorama. That powerful king\nof the Solar Dynasty was killed by a lion in a forest. This boy Sudars\xc2\x92ana is\nhis son.\n\n\n\n55\\. The father of this Manorama was very religious. He died fighting for the\ncause of his daughter's son. Now the present queen has become much afraid and\nhas therefore come to this wild forest.\n\n\n\n56\\. The son of this woman is now a minor; he is now taking your refuge. O\nbest of the Munis! Protect them.\n\n\n\n57\\. To give protection to any distressed person is to acquire merits higher\nthan performing a sacrifice. Therefore to protect one who is very much\nafflicted with fear and who is helpless will have still higher merits.\n\n\n\n58\\. Bharadvaja said :-- \xc2\x93O beautiful one! Remain in this hermitage without\nany fear; rear up your son here. O auspicious one! There is no cause of fear\nhere from your enemies.\n\n\n\n59\\. Better nourish and support your child. Your son will surely be a king and\nif you remain in this hermitage, no sorrow or grief will overtake you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n60\\. Vyasa said :-- When the great Muni Bharadvaja said thus, the queen\nManorama became peaceful. The Muni gave them a cottage to live in and there\nthey dwelt without any sorrow.\n\n\n\n61\\. Thus Manorama dwelt obediently with her maid servant, liked by all.\nVidalla also remained there and Manorama began to nourish her child.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifteenth chapter on the Devi Mahatmya and the battle between\nYudhajit and Virasena and the going away of Manorama to the forest in the 3rd\nAdhyaya of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 16](bk03ch16.htm)\n\n"
