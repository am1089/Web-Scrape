Although the writer of these words holds\nto the opinion that these physical practices cannot develop the mind at all,\nor contribute to its yogic or occult experience, he agrees that when the\n_hatha-yoga_ exercises are properly done they are very beneficial to the body.\nAs long as people have bodies they should treat them if possible as prize\nanimals, but if that is too much to ask they should at least give them good\nexercise as well as good rest and good food. In this sense only one should\nunderstand the well-known maxim: "No _r \xc4\x81ja_ without _hatha_ ; no _hatha_\nwithout _r \xc4\x81ja_."\n\nThe _\xc4\x81 san\xc4\x81s_ or postures have some advantages over\n\np. 88\n\nordinary physical exercises intended for muscular development. Although these\nlatter do also stimulate good breathing and benefit the nervous system to some\nextent, especially if used in conjunction with proper relaxation at suitable\ntimes, the _hatha-yoga_ postures do in addition provide suppleness and\nslenderness, and give massage to the internal organs. Besides this, when\nallied to suitable and not excessive breathing exercises, the entire body\nbenefits. None of the yoga schools aims at abnormal strength\xc2\x97a reasonable\nstandard such as is suitable for the ordinary purposes of life is regarded as\nsufficient, and more than that may often be just a matter of personal\nsatisfaction or pride, not the spiritual attainment which the _hatha-yog \xc4\xabs_,\n_r \xc4\x81ja-yog\xc4\xabs_ and all other yog\xc4\xabs are aiming at, which contains no self-\nsatisfaction. Incidentally, one must remark, great mental muscularity\xc2\x97to use a\nmetaphor\xc2\x97is also not sought by any of them. If there are mental giants among\nthem, this must be put down to some work of supererogation in that line in\ntheir previous lives.\n\nIn an earlier chapter we have spoken of _hatha_ as the "sun" and "moon"\nbreaths. It comes in, say some works, with the sound of ha and goes out with\nthe sound of tha. Another explanation is that the "sun" and "moon" correspond\nto the breaths travelling through the right and left nostrils. Still a third\nview is that as the whole word _hatha_ ordinarily means\n\np. 89\n\nforcefulness, the system of _hatha-yoga_ is one which, at least as compared\nwith other yogas, requires considerable energy. It has already been stated\nthat in those yogas the thinkings and meditations are intended to be done\nwithout allowing any tension in the body.\n\nWe may introduce the picture of a typical form of _hatha-yoga_ breathing by\nquoting from the _Shiva Sanhit \xc4\x81_:\n\n"The wise man, having closed the right nostril with the thumb of the right\nhand, and having drawn air in through the left nostril, should hold his breath\nas long as he can, and then let it out through the right nostril slowly and\ngently. Next, having breathed in through the right nostril, he should retain\nthe air as long as possible, and then breathe it out gently and very slowly\nthrough the left nostril.\n\n"Let him thus practice regularly, with twenty retentions, at sunrise, midday,\nsunset and midnight, every day, keeping a peaceful mind, and in three months\nthe channels of the body will have become purified. This is the first of four\nstages of _pr \xc4\x81n\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma_ (regulation of breath), and the signs of it are that\nthe body becomes healthy and likeable and emits a pleasant odor, and there\nwill be good appetite and digestion, cheerfulness, a good figure, courage,\nenthusiasm and strength.\n\np. 90\n\n"There are, however, certain things which the _swaras \xc4\x81dhaka_ (breath-\npractiser) must avoid: foods which are acid, astringent, pungent, salty,\nmustardy and bitter, and those fried in oil, and various activities of body\nand mind, bathing before sunrise, stealing, harmfulness, enmity, egotism,\ncunning, fasting, untruth, cruelty to animals, sexual attachments, fire, much\nconversation and much eating. On the contrary, he should use and enjoy _gh \xc4\xab_\n(butter clarified by simmering), milk, sweet food, betel without lime,\ncamphor, a good meditation-chamber with only a small entrance, contentment,\nwillingness to learn, the doing of household duties with _vair \xc4\x81gya_, singing\nof the names of Vishnu, hearing sweet music, firmness, patience, effort,\npurity, modesty, confidence and helping the teacher. If there is hunger, a\nlittle milk and butter may be taken before practice, but there should be no\npractice for some time after meals. It is better to eat a small amount of food\nfrequently (with at least three hours\xc2\x92 intervals) than much at once. If the\nbody perspires it should be well rubbed (with the hands). When the practice\nhas become well established, these rules need not be so strictly observed." 1\n\nOne does not wish to put any of these _hatha-yoga_ practices into print, to be\nread by various kinds of people, without sounding a warning. Many people\n\np. 91\n\nhave brought upon themselves incurable illness and even madness by practising\nthem without providing the proper conditions of body and mind. The old yoga\nbooks are full of such warnings, and they tell the would-be practicer to go to\na teacher who really knows all about these things, to receive personal\ninspection and instruction. For example, the _Gheranda Sanhit \xc4\x81_ announces\nthat if one begins the practices in hot, cold or rainy weather, disease will\nbe contracted, and also if there is not moderation in diet, for only one half\nthe stomach must ever be filled with solid food. 2 When the present writer\ntried, as a boy of fourteen or fifteen, the long alternate breathing for three\nquarters of an hour, he found when he stood up that he had lost his sense of\ntouch and weight. He handled things without feeling them, and walked without\nany sense of touching the ground. The sense returned only after ten or fifteen\nminutes.\n\nThe _Hatha Yoga Prad \xc4\xabpik\xc4\x81_ states that control of breath must be brought\nabout very gradually, "as lions, elephants and tigers are tamed," or else "the\nexperimenter will be killed," and by any mistake there arises cough, asthma,\nhead, eye and ear pains, and many other diseases. 3 The _Sh \xc4\x81ndilya Upanishad_\ngives the same warning. On the other hand, right\n\np. 92\n\npractice may be undertaken by anybody, even the young and the old, the sick\nand the weak, and will result in slenderness and rightness of body. 4\n\nThe theory behind these breathing exercises is that between the mind and the\nbody comes _pr \xc4\x81na_. This word is translated "principle of life"\xc2\x97referring to\nlife in the body. Five vital airs are mentioned extensively in the Sanskrit\nliterature which touches on the physiology of the human body. _Pr \xc4\x81na_ is\nalways referred to as the chief of these vital airs. The word comes from a\nverbal root "an" meaning "to breathe," and thus "to live." Patanjali in his\naphorism on _Pr \xc4\x81n\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma_ calls it regulation of the manner of movement of _shw\n\xc4\x81sa_ and _prashw \xc4\x81sa_, that is, breathing. 5 The late Dr. Vaman R. Kokatnur,\nnoted scientist and Sanskrit scholar, in a paper read at the American Chemical\nSociety\'s meeting in Detroit in September 1927, quoted a text which says that\nwhat is inhaled is _pr \xc4\x81na_ and what is exhaled is _ap \xc4\x81na_. On various\ngrounds he made out a good case for these being oxygen and carbon dioxide, a\nthird "air," _ud \xc4\x81na_, being hydrogen. Of the other two of the five, _sam \xc4\x81na_\nis generally spoken of as essential to digestion and _vy \xc4\x81na_ "pervades the\nwhole body." Many speak of\n\np. 93\n\nthese five airs as being something else, fine or "etheric," but all agree that\nvarious ways of breathing affect them all. Many of the teachers recommend the\ntraditional proportions of one unit of time for inbreathing ( _p \xc5\xabraka_), four\nunits for holding the breath within ( _Kumbhaka_ ), and two units for out-\nbreathing ( _rechaka_ ). The _Shiva Sanhit \xc4\x81_ speaks of the units being\ngradually lengthened, as seen in verse iii 57: "When the yog\xc4\xab is able to\npractice holding the breath for an hour and a half, various _siddhis_\n(faculties and powers) arise, including prophecy, travelling at will, sight\nand hearing at a distance, vision of the invisible worlds, entering others\xc2\x92\nbodies, turning various metals into gold, invisibility at will, and moving in\nthe air."\n\nVarious teachers and books offer more elaborate, as well as some simpler,\nbreathing exercises. The following eight are often mentioned: (1) Practice\n_kumbhaka_ (holding the breath) until the pressure of air is felt from head to\nfoot, then breathe out through the right nostril; (2) breathe in deeply and\nnoisily, hold as before, and exhale through the left nostril; (3) putting the\ntongue between the lips breathe in with a hissing sound; exhale through both\nnostrils; (4) breathe out as fully as possible, then in with a hissing sound,\nand go on very rapidly like bellows, until tired; then exhale by the right, or\n(5) the left\n\np. 94\n\nnostril; (6) breathe in with the sound of a female bee; (7) after breathing\nin, contract the throat, place the chin on the chest; breathe out very slowly;\n(8) simply hold the breath, without inbreathing or out-breathing, as long as\nyou like.\n\nWhile issuing warnings about these exercises, I would like to add that many\nhave found benefit from the following simple practice. Breathe in fairly fully\nwhile saying mentally to yourself " _p \xc5\xabraka_;" hold the breath in without any\nmuscular effort while saying " _kumbhaka_ , _kumbhaka_ , _kumbhaka_ ,\n_kumbhaka_ ;" breathe out quite fully while saying " _rechaka_ , _rechaka_."\nThis may be done at odd times as a pick-me-up, with generally about ten\nrepetitions. The best slowness or quickness of the words should be found by\nthe student for himself, but all the words should be of the same length. A\ntendency to lengthen them a little may gradually and rightly appear.\n\nSome teachers maintain that all the impurities of the body may be removed\nmerely by control of breath, but others hold that it is necessary to practice\nalso certain cleansings, especially in the case of persons who are flabby and\nphlegmatic. 6\n\nThe six principal purifications are: (1) slowly (under the direction of a\nteacher) learn to swallow a clean, slightly warm, thin cloth, four fingers\nbroad and fifteen spans long; hold on to the end of it, and\n\np. 95\n\ngradually draw it out again; (2) take an enema sitting in water and using a\nsmall bamboo tube; shake well and dispel; (3) draw a fine thread, twelve\nfingers long, in at one nostril and out at the mouth; (4) look at something\nwithout winking, until tears come; (5) with the head bent down, slowly massage\nthe intestines, round and round both ways, and (6) breathe rapidly, like the\nbellows of a blacksmith. 7 These acts are said to remove corpulence and many\nother diseases.\n\nThe _Gheranda Sanhit \xc4\x81_ has a much bigger collection\xc2\x97about twenty-four\npurifications\xc2\x97which includes swallowing air with the lips formed "like the\nbeak of a crow," and expelling it from below; doing the same with water;\ngently pressing the intestines towards the spine one hundred times, massaging\nthe depression at the bridge of the nose (especially after waking and after\nmeals); vomiting by tickling the throat; gargling; drawing air softly in at\none nostril, and sending it out softly at the other, alternately; drinking\nwater in at the nostrils and letting it out at the mouth. 8\n\nClosely connected with the elaborate practices of _pr \xc4\x81n\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma_ are the\npostures ( _\xc4\x81 san\xc4\x81s_). Quite often eighty-four of these are enumerated, but\nthe _Shiva_\n\np. 96\n\n[paragraph continues] _Sanhit \xc4\x81_ contents itself with recommending four, which\nare called "The Adept Seat," "The Lotus Seat," "The Powerful Seat," and "The\nSwastika Seat." These are briefly as follows: (1) body straight, legs crossed,\none heel at the anus, the other at the front, gaze between the eyebrows, chin\non breast; 9 (2) legs folded with feet, soles upwards, on opposite thighs,\narms crossed, hands on thighs, tongue pressed against teeth, chin on breast or\nheld up, gaze on tip of nose (or straight in front); or arms may be crossed\nbehind, hands holding great toes; 10 (3) legs stretched out, apart, head held\nin hands and placed on knees; 11 (4) feet between calves and thighs, body\nstraight. 12 The _Hatha Yoga Prad \xc4\xabpik\xc4\x81_ also advocates four _\xc4\x81 san\xc4\x81s_\nespecially, two being the same and two different.\n\nAn excellent modern book on _pr \xc4\x81n\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma_, _\xc4\x81 san\xc4\x81s_ etc., is _Yoga Asan \xc4\x81s_ by\nSw\xc4\x81m\xc4\xab Shiv\xc4\x81nanda, of Rishikesh, in the Him\xc4\x81layas. 13 In this the Sw\xc4\x81m\xc4\xab\nexplains with illustrations a large number of postures, including the _Sukh\n\xc4\x81sana_, or "pleasant posture" described and recommended for the West in my\n_Practical_\n\np. 97\n\n[paragraph continues] _Yoga: Ancient and Modern_. He also gives very useful\nsimple breathing exercises as well as the more elaborate ones.\n\nWe come now to another school of yoga called the laya yoga. Laya means\n"latent" or "in suspense." The especial features of this yoga are its study\nand practice of _kundalin \xc4\xab_ and the _chakras_. _Kundalin \xc4\xab_ is described as a\nforce lying in three and a half coils like a sleeping serpent, in a cavity\nnear the base of the spine. This is regarded as a goddess or power, "luminous\nas lightning," who, even though sleeping, maintains all living creatures. She\nlies there with her head blocking a fine channel which goes straight up the\nspine and is known as the _sushumn \xc4\x81_. Some, to link this up with modern\nthought, have called it the fount of bodily electricity.\n\nThe purpose of the laya-yoga practice is to awaken the _kundalin \xc4\xab_ (or\n"coiled one"), who will start up hissing, and can then be carried through the\nseries of six _chakras_ (literally, "wheels"), which are threaded upon that\nchannel at various points in the body, which are situated at the level of the\nbase of the spine, the root of the penis, the navel, the heart, the throat and\nthe eyebrows. These _chakras_ are depicted somewhat as flowers rather than\nwheels, and have petals respectively numbering four, six, eight, twelve,\nsixteen, and two.\n\np. 98\n\nThe works describing these _chakras_ , and the effects of meditation upon them\nor in them, are altogether too numerous even to mention. 14 They are depicted\nwith very much symbology. For example, the _an \xc4\x81hata chakra_ (at the heart)\nhas a _yantra_ or design showing twelve petals, each one bearing a certain\nletter of the alphabet. In the center circle there is a pair of interlaced\ntriangles, having written in the middle of them the syllable " _yam_ " (which\nis a _mantra_ or sound which can produce some effect when properly repeated).\nThis _yam_ is pictured as riding on a black antelope, and, in its final sound\n_m_ , which is written as a dot, a figure representing the male divinity is\nplaced. He is styled Isha, has three eyes, and holds out his hands with\ngestures of dispelling fear and granting boons. Near by, in the pericarp of\nthe lotus (for the _chakras_ are also called lotuses) is the female divinity\nK\xc4\x81kin\xc4\xab, seated on a red lotus, having golden color, dressed in yellow clothes,\nwearing all kinds of jewels and a garland of bones. She has four arms, two\nhands bearing a noose and a skull, and the other two showing signs of\ndispelling fear and granting boons. In the center, above the interlaced\ntriangles, is an inverted triangle as bright as lightning, and in that a\n\np. 99\n\nsymbol of Shiva of a golden color with a crescent moon surmounted by a dot\nupon its head. This _chakra_ , like all the _padmas_ (lotus flowers) is\nbrightly colored, the petals and pericarp being red.\n\nOne cannot attempt in this brief space to unravel the significance of all\nthese letters, colors and symbols, or to give the symbols of the other five\n_padmas_. Each _chakra_ has its own diagram, colors, animal, divinities,\nletters, etc. It will be evident that the yog\xc4\xab, as he meditates in each of\nthem in the course of his progress, will have plenty to think about. Arthur\nAvalon\'s excellent translation of the _Shatchakra Nir \xc5\xabpana_, with comments\nthereon, is a mine of information on the subject, but the thorough student\nshould also read various minor Upanishads, Pur\xc4\x81nas and general works on yoga\ntouching on this subject. There is a certain amount of conflicting testimony\non the subject of colors, divinities etc., but this does not mar the general\nunity of information as regards all the main features. 15\n\nThere is in all the literature on the subject a poetical rather than an exact\ndescription of what happens as _kundalin \xc4\xab_ rises. The spine is called "the\naxis of creation" for the body. In that is the channel _sushumn \xc4\x81_;\n\np. 100\n\nwithin that another, named _vajroli_ and within that again another, called\n_chitrin \xc4\xab_, "as fine as a spider\'s thread." On this tube the lotuses are said\nto be threaded "like knots on a bamboo rod." Kundalin\xc4\xab rises up little by\nlittle, as the yog\xc4\xab employs his will. In one practice he brings her as far as\nhe can, and, as she pierces any one of the lotuses, its face, which was turned\ndownwards before, turns upwards, and when the meditation is finished he leads\nher back to her home near the base of the spine. 16\n\nIt is further explained that as she leaves each _chakra_ on the way up, she\nwithdraws the functions of that center, and so makes them latent, hence the\nterm laya-yoga, or the Yoga of Suspension. It is, of course, natural that in\nsuch a process, as attention is given more and more to the higher thought, the\nlower responses should become latent, as, for example, when we are reading and\ndo not hear or see a person who enters the room.\n\nKundalin\xc4\xab proceeds upwards until she reaches the great "thousand-petalled\nlotus" at the top of the head,\n\np. 101\n\nbeyond all the six _chakras_. There she enjoys the bliss and power of union\nwith the source of all life, and afterwards, as she returns through the\ncenters she gives back to each its specific powers, purified and enhanced. The\nprocess of bringing _kundalin \xc4\xab_ to the highest point is usually considered to\nrequire some years, but there are exceptional cases in which it is done\nquickly.\n\nThe hatha-yoga books take up a curious view of the mind in relation to all\nthese matters. It is expressed in a few verses of the _Hatha-Yoga Prad \xc4\xabpik\xc4\x81_.\n"The mind is the lord of the senses; the breath is the lord of the mind; and\nthat depends on _n \xc4\x81da_." 17 "There is talk of _laya_ , _laya_ , but what is\nits character? _Laya_ is the non-arising of further v\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s, 18 and the\nforgetting of external things." 19 Some of the minor Upanishads, such as the\n_Muktika_ of the _Shukla-Yajurveda_ , have a similar idea.\n\nEven so brief an account of these practices as this is would be incomplete\nwithout mention of the _mudr \xc4\x81s_, or physical practices, and the _n \xc4\x81das_, or\ninternal sounds. The _mudr \xc4\x81s_, although in some cases similar to the\npurifications, are intended for a different\n\np. 102\n\npurpose\xc2\x97to obtain some delight or power, and to awaken _kundalin \xc4\xab_, for it is\nheld that the awakening can take place through _\xc4\x81 san\xc4\x81s_ (postures),\n_kumbhakas_ (holdings of the breath) and _mudr \xc4\x81s_.\n\nThough there are many _mudr \xc4\x81s_, only ten are usually recommended. Among the\nmost popular ones intended to awaken _kundalin \xc4\xab_ is that of supporting the\nbody on the palms of the hands and softly striking the posteriors on the\nground, which is also considered to remove wrinkles and grey hair. In another,\nvery highly recommended, the membrane under the tongue is gradually cut ("one\nhair\'s breadth every seven days"), and rubbed with salt and turmeric, so that\nthe severed parts will not join. The tongue is also gradually lengthened by a\nprocess resembling milking, so that after six months the yog\xc4\xab can turn it\nupwards into the cavity at the back of the palate, and thus, with the hole\nclosed and the breath suspended, contemplate _kundalin \xc4\xab_ and "drink the\nnectar" flowing there. Another physical method requires a sort of massage for\nan hour and a half morning and evening, for up to forty-five days. Still\nanother requires the feet to be crossed behind the neck.\n\nIt must be mentioned that those r\xc4\x81ja yog\xc4\xabs who do not approve of the awakening\nof _kundalin \xc4\xab_ by these external methods, nor even by meditation upon it,\nnevertheless usually believe that _kundalin \xc4\xab_ naturally\n\np. 103\n\nawakens and rises as a result of the purely internal meditations which they\npractice. This takes place a little at a time so that there is no strong\nfeeling or pain in the body, as is often the case when it is done by the\n_hatha-yoga_ methods. The purifying and subliming effects of the return\njourney through the _chakra_ in all cases awakens some degree of clairvoyance\nand similar powers, but what the yog\xc4\xab sees will depend upon his state of mind,\nand even then the understanding of what he sees will depend upon his\nevolutionary status. There is plenty of room for error, inasmuch as his own\nthoughts and those of others may easily be mistaken for objective realities,\nas in dreams.\n\nSome of the books prescribe an "elephant _mudr \xc4\x81_," which is performed by\nstanding up to the neck in water, drinking it in through the nostrils, sending\nit out through the mouth and then reversing the process. This resembles the\naction of elephants in the pools and rivers, though they use the trunk only,\nnot the mouth.\n\nNow we come to the _n \xc4\x81das_ or sounds. The _Shiva Sanhit \xc4\x81_ instructs the yog\xc4\xab\nto close the ears with the thumbs, the eyes with the index fingers, the\nnostrils with the middle fingers and the lips with the remaining four fingers.\nAfter some practice, he will begin to hear the mystic sounds. The first will\nbe like the\n\np. 104\n\nhum of a bee, then a flute and then a _v \xc4\xabn\xc4\x81_. With more practice there comes\nthe sound of bells, and afterwards thunder. The mind of the yog\xc4\xab becomes\nabsorbed in these sounds, and he forgets the external things which could\ndistract him. 20 These sounds are usually called _an \xc4\x81hata_, or belonging to\nthe heart center. According to the _Hatha Yoga Prad \xc4\xabpik\xc4\x81_, when the ears,\neyes, nose and mouth are closed, a clear sound is heard\xc2\x97first like the\ntinkling of ornaments, and later like kettle-drums; later still there is the\nsound of the flute and the _v \xc4\xabn\xc4\x81_. In the middle stage there may be the sound\nof bells and horns. The yog\xc4\xab must give his attention to the subtler sounds.\nThe _N \xc4\x81dabindu Upanishad_ also gives much the same order of sounds as the\n_Hatha Yoga Prad \xc4\xabpik\xc4\x81_, mentioning in stage one the sound of the sea, clouds,\nwaterfalls and kettledrums, in the second stage that of drums, bells and\nhorns, and thirdly, that of tinkling bells, flutes, _v \xc4\xabn\xc4\x81s_ and bees. The\n_Hansa Upanishad_ gives the order more in agreement with the _Shiva Sanhit \xc4\x81_.\nFirst come soft chattering sounds, then that of the bell, conch, lute,\ncymbals, flute, drum, double drum, and, lastly, thunder. The _n \xc4\x81da laya_ or\n"absorption\n\np. 105\n\nthrough sound" is regarded as a great aid to concentration. 21\n\n_Sam \xc4\x81dhi_, the highest practice of yoga, is conceived in a very material\nmanner in the _hatha-yoga_ books. The idea is that the yog\xc4\xab in _sam \xc4\x81dhi_ is\nuninfluenced by anything external, because the senses have become inactive,\nand he does not even know himself or others. Although the _Gheranda Sanhit \xc4\x81_\nsays that _sam \xc4\x81dhi_ involves union of the individual with the supreme Self (\n_Par \xc4\x81tman_) so that "I am Brahma and no other; Brahma am I, without any\nsorrows; I am of the nature of fundamental existence, knowledge and bliss,\nalways free and self -supporting," 22 it also prescribes, for the attainment\nof this, various _mudr \xc4\x81s_ or physical practices, such as that of turning the\ntongue into the nasal cavity and stopping the breath, 23 the theory being that\nall you need to do is to cut off contact with this world, and the other state\nwill be there.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[90:1](gsoy07.htm#fr_50) _Shiva Sanhit \xc4\x81_ iii 22-40; abridged translation.\n\n[91:2](gsoy07.htm#fr_51) _Gheranda Sanhit \xc4\x81_ v 8, 16, 22.\n\n[91:3](gsoy07.htm#fr_52) ii 15-18, and i 15.\n\n[92:4](gsoy07.htm#fr_53) i 64, and ii 20.\n\n[92:5](gsoy07.htm#fr_54) See _Practical Yoga: Ancient and Modern_ , by Ernest\nWood; Ch. 8, Aphorism ii 49.\n\n[94:6](gsoy07.htm#fr_55) _Hatha Yoga Prad \xc4\xabpik\xc4\x81_ ii 37, 21.\n\n[95:7](gsoy07.htm#fr_56) _Ibid_. ii 22-35.\n\n[95:8](gsoy07.htm#fr_57) _Gheranda Sanhit \xc4\x81_ i, 13-61.\n\n[96:9](gsoy07.htm#fr_58) _Shiva Sanhit \xc4\x81_ iii 85; _Gheranda Sanhit \xc4\x81_ ii 7, 8;\n_Hatha Yoga Prad \xc4\xabpik\xc4\x81_ i 36.\n\n[96:10](gsoy07.htm#fr_59) _Shiva Sanhit \xc4\x81_ ii 88; _Gheranda S_. ii 9; _Hatha-\nyoga P_. i 45, 46.\n\n[96:11](gsoy07.htm#fr_60) _Shiva Sanhit \xc4\x81_ iii 92; _Gheranda S_. 23; _Hatha-\nyoga P_. i 29.\n\n[96:12](gsoy07.htm#fr_61) _Shiva Sanhit \xc4\x81_ iii 95; _Gheranda S_. ii 14;\n_Hatha-yoga P_. i 20.\n\n[96:13](gsoy07.htm#fr_62) Published by The Vaman Press, 31 Broadway, Madras,\nIndia.\n\n[98:14](gsoy07.htm#fr_63) Except that one would wish to refer the Western\nreader to _The Serpent Power_ , by Arthur Avalon, published by Ganesh and Co.,\nThyagarayanagar, Madras, India, for very full information.\n\n[99:15](gsoy07.htm#fr_64) The _Yoga Kundal \xc4\xab Upanishad_ gives sixteen petals\nin the heart center, instead of twelve, and the _Dhy \xc4\x81nabindu Upanishad_ and\nthe _Sh \xc4\x81ndilya Upanishad_ both describe the navel _padma_ as having twelve\npetals instead of ten.\n\n[100:16](gsoy07.htm#fr_65) There is a little difference of opinion here. Some\nhold that once she has reached the heart chakra that will be her permanent\nhome, and she will not return below it. Others say that even from the\nbeginning she was at the level of the navel. These are not altogether\nreasonable views, if, as is usually believed, _kundalin \xc4\xab_ has the work of\npurifying and transmuting all the lower centers on her return journey from the\nhigher.\n\n[101:17](gsoy07.htm#fr_66) _Hatha-Yoga Prad \xc4\xabpik\xc4\x81_ iv 29.\n\n[101:18](gsoy07.htm#fr_67) V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81 is the "perfume" of past attachments or\ndesires, which now produce pleasure and pain; if one may use a crude simile,\nlike the smell of onions long after they have been eaten.\n\n[101:19](gsoy07.htm#fr_68) iv 34.\n\n[104:20](gsoy07.htm#fr_69) _Shiva Sanhit \xc4\x81_ v 22-28.
