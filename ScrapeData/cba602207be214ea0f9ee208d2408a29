Only a few pure souls know of its true delight.  \nMusic is all around it, and there the heart partakes of the joy of the\nInfinite Sea.  \nKabir says: "Dive thou into that Ocean of sweetness: thus let all errors of\nlife and of death flee away."\n\nBehold how the thirst of the five senses is quenched there! and the three\nforms of misery are no more!  \nKabir says: "It is the sport of the Unattainable One: look within, and behold\nhow the moon-beams of that Hidden One shine in you."  \nThere falls the rhythmic beat of life and death: p. 63  \nRapture wells forth, and all space is radiant with light.  \nThere the Unstruck Music is sounded; it is the music of the love of the three\nworlds.  \nThere millions of lamps of sun and of moon are burning;  \nThere the drum beats, and the lover swings in play.  \nThere love-songs resound, and light rains in showers; and the worshipper is\nentranced in the taste of the heavenly nectar.  \nLook upon life and death; there is no separation between them,  \nThe right hand and the left hand are one and the same.  \nKabir says: "There the wise man is speechless; for this truth may never be\nfound in Vadas or in books."\n\nI have had my Seat on the Self-poised One, p. 64  \nI have drunk of the Cup of the Ineffable,  \nI have found the Key of the Mystery,  \nI have reached the Root of Union.  \nTravelling by no track, I have come to the Sorrowless Land: very easily has\nthe mercy of the great Lord come upon me.  \nThey have sung of Him as infinite and unattainable: but I in my meditations\nhave seen Him without sight.  \nThat is indeed the sorrowless land, and none know the path that leads there:  \nOnly he who is on that path has surely transcended all sorrow.  \nWonderful is that land of rest, to which no merit can win;  \nIt is the wise who has seen it, it is the wise who has sung of it.  \nThis is the Ultimate Word: but can any express its marvellous savour? p. 65  \nHe who has savoured it once, he knows what joy it can give.  \nKabir says: "Knowing it, the ignorant man becomes wise, and the wise man\nbecomes speechless and silent,  \nThe worshipper is utterly inebriated,  \nHis wisdom and his detachment are made perfect;  \nHe drinks from the cup of the inbreathings and the outbreathings of love."\n\nThere the whole sky is filled with sound, and there that music is made without\nfingers and without strings;  \nThere the game of pleasure and pain does not cease.  \nKabir says: "If you merge your life in the Ocean of Life, you will find your\nlife in the Supreme Land of Bliss."\n\nWhat a frenzy of ecstasy there is in p. 66 every hour! and the worshipper is\npressing out and drinking the essence of the hours: he lives in the life of\nBrahma.  \nI speak truth, for I have accepted truth in life; I am now attached to truth,\nI have swept all tinsel away.  \nKabir says: "Thus is the worshipper set free from fear; thus have all errors\nof life and of death left him."\n\nThere the sky is filled with music:  \nThere it rains nectar:  \nThere the harp-strings jingle, and there the drums beat.  \nWhat a secret splendour is there, in the mansion of the sky!  \nThere no mention is made of the rising and the setting of the sun;  \nIn the ocean of manifestation, which is the light of love, day and night are\nfelt to be one. p. 67  \nJoy for ever, no sorrow,--no struggle!  \nThere have I seen joy filled to the brim, perfection of joy;  \nNo place for error is there.  \nKabir says: "There have I witnessed the sport of One Bliss!"\n\nI have known in my body the sport of the universe: I have escaped from the\nerror of this world..  \nThe inward and the outward are become as one sky, the Infinite and the finite\nare united: I am drunken with the sight of this All!  \nThis Light of Thine fulfils the universe: the lamp of love that burns on the\nsalver of knowledge.  \nKabir says: "There error cannot enter, and the conflict of life and death is\nfelt no more."\n\np. 68\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XVIII](sok019.htm)\n\n'
