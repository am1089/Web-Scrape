If a person who has taken (a lease of) land (for cultivation) does not\nexert himself, and hence (the land) bears no crop, he shall, if he is rich, be\nmade to pay (to the owner of the land the value of the crop) that ought to\nhave grown. 1\n\n2\\. A servant in tillage who abandons his work shall be flogged. 2\n\n3\\. The same (punishment shall be awarded) to a herdsman (who leaves his\nwork);\n\n4\\. And the flock (entrusted) to him shall be taken away (and be given to some\nother herdsman).\n\n5\\. If cattle, leaving their stable, eat (the crops of other persons, then the\nowner of the crops, or the king's servants), may make them lean (by impounding\nthem); (but) he shall not exceed (in such punishment). 5\n\np. 169\n\n6\\. If (a herdsman) who has taken cattle under his care, allows them to\nperish, or loses (them by theft, through his negligence), he shall replace\nthem (or pay their value) to the owners. 6a\n\n7\\. If (the king's forester) sees cattle that have been sent into the forest\nthrough negligence (without a herdsman), he shall lead them back to the\nvillage and make them over to the owners.\n\n8\\. If the same negligence (occur) again, he shall once impound them (and\nafterwards give them back).\n\n9\\. (If the same fault be committed again) after that (second time), he shall\nnot take care (of them).\n\n10\\. He who has taken unintentionally the property of another shall be\nreprimanded, in case (the property be) fuel, water, roots, flowers, fruits,\nperfumes, fodder, or vegetables.\n\n11\\. (If he takes the above-mentioned kinds of property) intentionally, his\ngarment shall be taken away.\n\n12\\. He who takes intentionally food when he is in danger of his life shall\nnot be punished.\n\n13\\. If the king does not punish a punishable offence, the guilt falls upon\nhim. 13\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[168:1](sbe0263.htm#fr_781) **28**. This Sutra shows that the system of\nleasing land against a certain share of the crops, which now prevails\ngenerally in Native States, and is not uncommon in private contracts on\nBritish territory, was in force in \xc3\x82pastamba's times.\n\n[168:2](sbe0263.htm#fr_782) See Colebrooke, Digest, Book III, Text lxviii, for\nthis Sutra and the following two. Another commentator, quoted by Haradatta,\nconnects this Sutra with the preceding, and refers it to a poor lessee of\nland, who cannot pay the value of the crop which was lost through his\nnegligence. A third explanation refers the Sutra to a cultivator who neglects\nto till his land. _G_ agannatha's authorities, the _K_ intama _n_ i and\nRatnakara, agree with Haradatta's first explanation.\n\n[168:5](sbe0263.htm#fr_783) Manu VIII, 240; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_.
