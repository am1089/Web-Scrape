I will now relate how Urjoon carried off Shree\nKrishnu Chund Jee\'s sister, Soobhudra, from Dwarka; and how Shree Krishnu\nChund went and abode in Mithila, listen with attention: when Dewukee\'s\ndaughter, whose name was Soobhudra, and who was younger than Shree Krishnu\nJee, was marriageable; Basoodeo Jee having invited several of the descendants\nof Judoo, and Shree Krishnu and Bulram said, "The girl is now of a fit age to\nbe married, to whom shall we give her?" Bulram Jee replied, "It is said, \'That\nwe ought to contract marriage, enmity and friendship with equals; one thing\noccurs to me, that we ought to marry this girl to Doorjodhun, and obtain\nrenown and greatness in the world." Shree Krishnu Chund said, "In my opinion,\nwe shall obtain a high reputation in the world by giving her to Urjoon."\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! on Bulram\'s speaking, no one uttered a\nword; but when Shree Krishnu Chund Jee had spoken, all exclaimed, "It is most\nadvisable to marry the girl to Urjoon." Bulram Jee was offended at hearing\nthis, and rose up and went away; and the party present, observing that he was\noffended, remained silent; when Urjoon afterwards received information of\nthese circumstances, he assumed the disguise of a religious mendicant; and,\ntaking\n\np. 422\n\na staff and wooden pot went to Dwarka; and, having selected a convenient spot\nspread a deer\'s skin, and sat upon it: he remained thus for four months during\nthe whole rains, and no one discovered his secret purpose; looking upon him as\na guest, they all paid him attention; and, for the sake of Vishnu, entertained\naffection for him; Krishnu knew all his secrets, but did not reveal them to\nany one.\n\nO great king! one day Buldeo Jee also invited and brought with him Urjoon to\nan entertainment at ibis house, when Urjoon sat down to eat, he beheld\nSoobhudra, with a body like the moon, and eyes like the deer. On seeing her\nUrjoon was fascinated; and, avoiding the gaze of all, began to look upon her\nwith averted glance; and thought to himself, "When will Bruhmu accomplish what\nis destined in my fate?" Whilst on the other hand Soobhudra Jee, pleased with\nthe brilliancy of his countenance, was saying to herself, "He is some prince\nand not a religious mendicant, why is he sad?"\n\nHaving thus spoken, Soobhudra Jee went into the house and began to think of\nobtaining a husband.; and on the other hand, Urjoon, after he had finished\neating, came to his seat, and was occupied with all kinds of anxieties as to\nhow he should gain possession of his beloved. Some days afterwards, on the\noccasion of the festival of Shivurat, all the inhabitants of the city, male\nand female, went outside the city to worship Shivu. Soobhudra went there also\nwith her female companions and attendants. Having heard of her going, Urjoon\nmounted his chariot, and taking his bow and arrows, went there and was ready.\n\nWhilst, O great king! Soobhudra was returning with her female friends after\nhaving worshipped Shivu, Urjoon at sight of her abandoned all reserve and\nmodesty; and seizing her by the hand, lifted her into his chariot, and went\noff. Bulram was greatly enraged, when he heard of it; he took his plough and\nwooden pestle on his shoulder; his eyes were bloodshot, he spoke in a voice of\nthunder; "I will now go and\n\np. 423\n\nutterly destroy him, and will lift up the world and place it upon my forehead,\nhow shall a beggar carry off my beloved sister, Soobhudra? Wheresoever I may\ncatch this religious mendicant, I will destroy him, and search out and utterly\ndestroy all his family."\n\nO great king! Bulram Jee continued to make many idle and very angry speeches,\nwhen, having heard what had occurred, Purdiyomun, Unroodru, Sumboo and other\nnoble descendants of Judoo came into the presence of Buldeo Jee, and said with\njoined hands, "O great king! if you give us the order, we will lay hold of,\nand bring your enemy here."\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! when Bulram taking all the descendants of Judoo with him, was ready to\ngo in pursuit of Urjoon, Shree Krishnu Chund went and explained to Buldeo all\nthe [secrets](errata.htm#26) connected with the carrying off Soobhudra; and\nsaid in a tone of the greatest submissiveness, "Brother! Urjoon, in the first\nplace, is the son of our paternal aunt; and in the second, he is my greatest\nfriend; he has committed this act heedlessly, and without due thought; but it\nis not at all right for us to fight with him; this would be contrary to\nreligion, and contrary to the custom of the world; and whoever might hear of\nour fighting would say, \'That the friendship of the descendants of Judoo is\nlike a wall of sand.\'" On hearing these words, Bulram Jee beating his head,\nand being greatly enraged said, "Brother! this is a common custom with you to\nraise a fire, and then run for water; otherwise, if you had not taken part in\nthe business, what power had Urjoon to carry off my sister?" Having thus\nspoken, Bulram Jee suffered great regret, and was very angry, and looking at\nhis brother dashed his plough and wooden pestle on the ground, and sat down;\nand all the descendants of Judoo sat down also with him.\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja! whilst Shree Krishnu Chund entered into\nexplanations with them all, Urjoon went\n\np. 424\n\nhome and married Soobhudra, in the manner prescribed by the Vedas. On\nreceiving intelligence of the marriage, Shree Krishnu and Bulram Jee sent off\nto Hustinapoor, in charge of a brahmin, clothes, jewels, male and female\nservants, elephants, horses, chariots and a large sum of money; afterwards\nShree Moorari, the friend of his worshippers, mounted his chariot and went to\nMithila, where there were two worshippers of his, named Sootdeo and Buhoolas,\nthe one a Raja, and the other a brahmin.\n\nO great king! on Krishnu\'s departure, Narud, Bamdeo, Byas, Atri, Purshooram,\nand many other sages came and accompanied Shree Krishnu Chund Joe; whatever\ncountries Krishnu passed through, the Rajas of them came out to meet him, and\nworshipped him, and gave him presents; at length, after a journey of some\ndays, Krishnu arrived there; when they heard of Huri\'s arrival, the two\nworshippers rose up, and came running hastily to him with presents. During\ntheir interview with Krishnu, they both placed their presents before him; and,\nmaking obeisance, and standing in his presence with joined hands, said, with\nthe utmost submissiveness, "O sea of compassion and brother of the poor! you\nhave shown great mercy, in having allowed sinners like us to see you, and\nthereby made us pure, and put an end to our being born and dying."\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great\nking! Shree Krishnu Chund, acquainted with the secrets of the heart, having\nbeheld the sincere faith [of](errata.htm#27) those two worshippers, assumed\ntwo bodily forms, and went and dwelt in the houses of both; they entertained\nand amused him in an agreeable manner; and Huri made a stay of some days, and\nmade them exceedingly happy; after this, when Krishnu having gratified all\ntheir wishes, and increased their knowledge, went to Dwarka; the sages and\nsaints took leave of him on the road, and Huri went and abode happily at\nDwarka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXXVII](psa88.htm)\n\n'
