 \nThy mother thirsts, and thou hast played,  \nAnd bathing in the brook delayed.  \nShe weeps because thou camest not;  \nHaste, O my son, within the cot.  \nIf she or I have ever done  \nA thing to pain thee, dearest son,  \nDismiss the memory from thy mind:  \nA hermit thou, be good and kind.  \nOn thee our lives, our all, depend:  \nThou art thy friendless parents\' friend.  \nThe eyeless couple\'s eye art thou:  \nThen why so cold and silent now?\'  \n\nWith sobbing voice and bosom wrung  \nI scarce could move my faltering tongue,  \nAnd with my spirit filled with dread  \nI looked upon the sage, and said,  \nWhile mind, and sense, and nerve I strung  \nTo fortify my trembling tongue,  \nAnd let the aged hermit know  \nHis son\'s sad fate, my fear and woe:  \n\'High-minded Saint, not I thy child,  \nA warrior, Das\'aratha styled.  \nI bear a grievous sorrow\'s weight  \nBorn of a deed which good men hate.  \nMy lord, I came to Sarj?s shore,  \nAnd in my hand my bow I bore  \nFor elephant or beast of chase  \nThat seeks by night his drinking place,  \nThere from the stream a sound I heard,  \nAs if a jar the water stirred,  \nAn elephant, I thought, was nigh:  \nI aimed, and let an arrow fly.  \nSwift to the place I made my way,  \nAnd there a wounded hermit lay  \nGasping for breath: the deadly dart  \nStood quivering in his youthful heart.  \nI hastened near with pain oppressed;  \nHe faltered out his last behest.  \nAnd quickly, as he bade me do,  \nFrom his pierced side the shaft I drew.  \nI drew the arrow from the rent,  \nAnd up to heaven the hermit went,  \nLamenting, as from earth he passed,  \nHis aged parents to the last.  \nThus, unaware, the deed was done:  \nMy hand, unwitting killed thy son.  \nFor what remains, O, let me win  \nThy pardon for my heedless sin.\'  \n\nAs the sad tale of sin I told  \nThe hermit\'s grief was uncontrolled.  \nWith flooded eyes, and sorrow-faint,  \nThus spake the venerable saint:  \nI stood with hand to hand applied,  \nAnd listened as he spoke and sighed:  \n\'If thou, O King, hadst left unsaid  \nBy thine own tongue this tale of dread,  \nThy head for hideous guilt accursed  \nHad in a thousand pieces burst.  \nA hermits blood by warrior spilt,  \nIn such a case, with purposed guilt,  \nDown from his high estate would bring  \nEven the thunder\'s mighty King  \nAnd he a dart who ( _illegible_ ) sends  \nAgainst the devotee who spends  \nHis pure life by the law of heaven--  \nThat sinner\'s head will split in seven.  \nThou livest, for thy heedless hand  \nHas wrought a deed thou hast not planned,  \nElse thou and all of Raghu\'s line  \nHad perished by this act of thine.  \nNow guide us,\' thus the hermit said,  \n\'Forth to the spot where he lies dead.  \nGuide us, this day, O Monarch, we  \nFor the last time our son would see:  \nThe hermit dress of skin he wore  \nRent from his limbs distained with gore;  \nHis senseless body lying slain,  \nHis soul in Yama\'s dark domain.\'  \n\nAlone the mourning pair I led,  \nTheir souls with woe disquieted,  \nAnd let the dame and hermit lay  \n\np. 171  \n\nTheir hands upon the breathless clay.  \nThe father touched his son, and pressed  \nThe body to his aged breast;  \nThen falling by the dead boy\'s side,  \nHe lifted up his voice, and cried:  \n\n\'Hast thou no word, my child, to say?  \nNo greeting for thy sire to-day?  \nWhy art thou angry, darling? why  \nWilt thou upon the cold earth lie?  \nIf thou, my son, art wroth with me,  \nHere, duteous child, thy mother see.  \nWhat! no embrace for me, my son?  \nNo word of tender love--not one?  \nWhose gentle voice, so soft and clear,  \nSoothing my spirit, shall I hear  \nWhen evening comes, with accents sweet  \nScripture or ancient lore repeat?  \nWho, having fed the sacred fire,  \nAnd duly bathed, as texts require.  \nWill cheer, when evening rites are done,  \nThe father mourning for his son?  \nWho will the daily meal provide  \nFor the poor wretch who lacks a guide,  \nFeeding the helpless with the best  \nBerries and roots, like some dear guest?  \nHow can these hands subsistence find  \nFor thy poor mother, old and blind?  \nThe wretched votaress how sustain,  \nWho mourns her child in ceaseless pain?  \nStay yet a while, my darling, stay,  \nNor fly to Yama\'s realm to-day.  \nTo-morrow I thy sire and she  \nWho bare thee, child, will go with, thee. 1  \nThen when I look on Yama, I  \nTo great Vivasvat\'s son will cry:  \n\'Hear, King of justice, and restore  \nOur child to feed us, I implore.  \nLord of the world, of mighty fame,  \nFaithful and just, admit my claim,  \nAnd grant this single boon to free  \nMy soul from fear, to one like me.\'  \nBecause, my son, untouched by stain,  \nBy sinful hands thou fallest slain  \nWin, through thy truth, the sphere where those  \nWho die by hostile darts repose.  \nSeek the blest home prepared for all  \nThe valiant who in battle fall,  \nWho face the foe and scorn to yield,  \nIn glory dying on the field.  \nRise to the heaven where Dhundhumar  \nAnd Nahush, mighty heroes, are,  \nWhere Janamejay and the blest  \nDilipa, Sagar, S\'alvya, rest:  \n\nHome of all virtuous spirits, earned  \nBy fervent rites and Scripture learned:  \nBy those whose sacred fires have glowed.  \nWhose liberal hands have fields bestowed:  \nBy givers of a thousand cows,  \nBy lovers of one faithful spouse:  \nBy those who serve their masters well.  \nAnd cast away this earthly shell.  \nNone of my race can ever know  \nThe bitter pain of lasting woe.  \nBut doomed to that dire fate is he  \nWhose guilty hand has slaughtered thee.  \n\nThus with wild tears the aged saint  \nMade many a time his piteous plaint,  \nThen with his wife began to shed  \nThe funeral water for the dead.  \nBut in a shape celestial clad,  \nWon by the merits of the lad.  \nThe spirit from the body brake  \nAnd to the mourning parents spake:  \n\'A glorious home in realms above  \nRewards my care and filial love.  \nYou, honoured parents, soon shall be  \nPartakers of that home with me.\'  \n\nHe spake, and swiftly mounting high,  \nWith Indra near him, to the sky  \nOn a bright car, with flame that glowed,  \nSublime the duteous hermit rode.  \n\nThe father, with his consort\'s aid.  \nThe funeral rites with water paid,  \nAnd thus his speech to me renewed  \nWho stood in suppliant attitude:  \n\'Slay me this day, O, slay me, King,  \nFor death no longer has a sting.  \nChildless am I: thy dart has done  \nTo death my dear, my only son.  \nBecause the boy I loved so well  \nSlain by thy heedless arrow fell,  \nMy curse upon thy soul shall press  \nWith bitter woe and heaviness.  \nI mourn a slaughtered child, and thou  \nShalt feel the pangs that kill me now.  \nBereft and suffering e\'en as I,  \nSo shalt thou mourn thy son, and die.  \nThy hand unwitting dealt the blow  \nThat laid a holy hermit low,  \nAnd distant, therefore, is the time  \nWhen thou shalt suffer for the crime.  \nThe hour shall come when, crushed by woes  \nLike these I feel, thy life shall close:  \nA debt to pay in after days  \nLike his the priestly fee who pays."  \n\nThis curse on me the hermit laid,  \nNor yet his tears and groans were stayed.  \nThen on the pire their bodies cast  \nThe pair; and straight to heaven they passed.  \nAs in sad thought I pondered long  \nBack to my memory came the wrong  \nDone in wild youth, O lady dear.  \nWhen \'twas my boast to shoot by ear.  \n\np. 172  \n\nThe deed has borne the fruit, which now  \nHangs ripe upon the bending bough:  \nThus dainty meats the palate please,  \nAnd lure the weak to swift disease.  \nNow on my soul return with dread  \nThe words that noble hermit said,  \nThat I for a dear son should grieve,  \nAnd of the woe my life should leave.\'  \n\nThus spake the king with many a tear;  \nThen to his wife he cried in fear:  \n\'I cannot see thee, love; but lay  \nThy gentle hand in mine, I pray.  \nAh me, if Rama touched me thus,  \nIf once, returning home to us,  \nHe bade me wealth and lordship give,  \nThen, so I think, my soul would live.  \nUnlike myself, unjust and mean  \nHave been my ways with him, my Queen,  \nBut like himself is all that he,  \nMy noble son, has done to me.  \nHis son, though far from right he stray,  \nWhat prudent sire would cast away?  \nWhat banished son would check his ire,  \nNor speak reproaches of his sire?  \nI see thee not: these eyes grow blind,  \nAnd memory quits my troubled mind.  \nAngels of Death are round me: they  \nSummon my soul with speed away.  \nWhat woe more grievous can there be,  \nThat, when from light and life I flee,  \nI may not, ere I part, behold  \nMy virtuous Rama, true and bold?  \nGrief for my son, the brave and true,  \nWhose joy it was my will to do,  \nDries up my breath, as summer dries  \nThe last drop in the pool that lies.  \nNot men, but blessed Gods, are they  \nWhose eyes shall see his face that day;  \nSee him, when fourteen years are past,  \nWith earrings decked return at last.  \nMy fainting mind forgets to think:  \nLow and more low my spirits sink.  \nEach from its seat, my senses steal:  \nI cannot hear, or taste, or feel.  \nThis lethargy of soul o\'ercomes  \nEach organ, and its function numbs:  \nSo when the oil begins to fail,  \nThe torch\'s rays grow faint and pale.  \nThis flood of woe caused by this hand  \nDestroys me helpless and unmanned,  \nResistless as the floods that bore  \nA passage through the river shore.  \nAh Raghu\'s son, ah mighty-armed,  \nBy whom my cares were soothed and charmed,  \nMy son in whom I took delight,  \nNow vanished from thy father\'s sight!  \nKaus\'alya, ah, I cannot see;  \nSumitra, gentle devotee!  \nAlas, Kaikeyi, cruel dame,  \nMy bitter foe, thy father\'s shame!\'  \n\nKaus\'alya and Sumitra kept  \nTheir watch beside him as he wept.  \nAnd Das\'aratha moaned and sighed,  \nAnd grieving for his darling died.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[171:1](ry142.htm#fr_337) So dying York cries over the body of Suffolk:\n\n  \n          \'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!  \n   My soul shall thine keep company to heaven.  \n   Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast.\'  \n                          _King Henry V, Act IV, 6_  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXV.: The Women\'s Lament.](ry143.htm)\n\n'
