The police were continually in and out. The\nservants of the house were in a great flurry.\n\nKhema, my maid, came up to me and said: "Oh, Rani Mother! for goodness" sake\nput away my gold necklace and armlets in your iron safe." To whom was I to\nexplain that the Rani herself had been weaving all this network of trouble,\nand had got caught in it, too? I had to play the benign protector and take\ncharge of Khema\'s ornaments and Thako\'s savings. The milk-woman, in her turn,\nbrought along and kept in my room a box in which were a Benares _sari_ and\nsome other of her valued possessions. "I got these at your wedding," she told\nme.\n\nWhen, tomorrow, my iron safe will be opened in the presence of these--Khema,\nThako, the milk-woman and all the rest ... Let me not think of it! Let me\nrather try to think what it will be like when this third day of Magh comes\nround again after a year has passed. Will all the wounds of my home life then\nbe still as fresh as ever? ...\n\nAmulya writes that he will come later in the evening. I cannot remain alone\nwith my thoughts, doing nothing. So I sit down again to make cakes for him. I\nhave finished making quite a quantity, but still I must go on. Who will eat\nthem? I shall distribute them amongst the servants. I must do so this very\nnight. Tonight is my limit. Tomorrow will not be in my hands.\n\nI went on untiringly, frying cake after cake. Every now and then it seemed to\nme that there was some noise in the direction of my rooms, upstairs. Could it\nbe that my husband had missed the key of the safe, and the Bara Rani had\nassembled all the servants to help him to hunt for it? No, I must not pay heed\nto these sounds. Let me shut the door.\n\nI rose to do so, when Thako came panting in: "Rani Mother, oh, Rani Mother!"\n\n"Oh get away!" I snapped out, cutting her short. "Don\'t come bothering me."\n\n"The Bara Rani Mother wants you," she went on. "Her nephew has brought such a\nwonderful machine from Calcutta. It talks like a man. Do come and hear it!"\n\nI did not know whether to laugh or to cry. So, of all things, a gramophone\nneeds must come on the scene at such a time, repeating at every winding the\nnasal twang of its theatrical songs! What a fearsome thing results when a\nmachine apes a man.\n\nThe shades of evening began to fall. I knew that Amulya would not delay to\nannounce himself--yet I could not wait. I summoned a servant and said: "Go and\ntell Amulya Babu to come straight in here." The man came back after a while to\nsay that Amulya was not in--he had not come back since he had gone.\n\n"Gone!" The last word struck my ears like a wail in the gathering darkness.\nAmulya gone! Had he then come like a streak of light from the setting sun,\nonly to be gone for ever? All kinds of possible and impossible dangers flitted\nthrough my mind. It was I who had sent him to his death. What if he was\nfearless? That only showed his own greatness of heart. But after this how was\nI to go on living all by myself?\n\nI had no memento of Amulya save that pistol--his reverence- offering. It\nseemed to me that this was a sign given by Providence. This guilt which had\ncontaminated my life at its very root--my God in the form of a child had left\nwith me the means of wiping it away, and then vanished. Oh the loving gift--\nthe saving grave that lay hidden within it!\n\nI opened my box and took out the pistol, lifting it reverently to my forehead.\nAt that moment the gongs clanged out from the temple attached to our house. I\nprostrated myself in salutation.\n\nIn the evening I feasted the whole household with my cakes. "You have managed\na wonderful birthday feast--and all by yourself too!" exclaimed my sister-in-\nlaw. "But you must leave something for us to do." With this she turned on her\ngramophone and let loose the shrill treble of the Calcutta actresses all over\nthe place. It seemed like a stable full of neighing fillies.\n\nIt got quite late before the feasting was over. I had a sudden longing to end\nmy birthday celebration by taking the dust of my husband\'s feet. I went up to\nthe bedroom and found him fast asleep. He had had such a worrying, trying day.\nI raised the edge of the mosquito curtain very very gently, and laid my head\nnear his feet. My hair must have touched him, for he moved his legs in his\nsleep and pushed my head away.\n\nI then went out and sat in the west verandah. A silk-cotton tree, which had\nshed all its leaves, stood there in the distance, like a skeleton. Behind it\nthe crescent moon was setting. All of a sudden I had the feeling that the very\nstars in the sky were afraid of me--that the whole of the night world was\nlooking askance at me. Why? Because I was alone.\n\nThere is nothing so strange in creation as the man who is alone. Even he whose\nnear ones have all died, one by one, is not alone-- companionship comes for\nhim from behind the screen of death. But he, whose kin are there, yet no\nlonger near, who has dropped out of all the varied companionship of a full\nhome--the starry universe itself seems to bristle to look on him in his\ndarkness.\n\nWhere I am, I am not. I am far away from those who are around me. I live and\nmove upon a world-wide chasm of separation, unstable as the dew-drop upon the\nlotus leaf.\n\nWhy do not men change wholly when they change? When I look into my heart, I\nfind everything that was there, still there--only they are topsy-turvy. Things\nthat were well-ordered have become jumbled up. The gems that were strung into\na necklace are now rolling in the dust. And so my heart is breaking.\n\nI feel I want to die. Yet in my heart everything still lives-- nor even in\ndeath can I see the end of it all: rather, in death there seems to be ever so\nmuch more of repining. What is to be ended must be ended in this life--there\nis no other way out.\n\nOh forgive me just once, only this time, Lord! All that you gave into my hands\nas the wealth of my life, I have made into my burden. I can neither bear it\nlonger, nor give it up. O Lord, sound once again those flute strains which you\nplayed for me, long ago, standing at the rosy edge of my morning sky--and let\nall my complexities become simple and easy. Nothing save the music of your\nflute can make whole that which has been broken, and pure that which has been\nsullied. Create my home anew with your music. No other way can I see.\n\nI threw myself prone on the ground and sobbed aloud. It was for mercy that I\nprayed--some little mercy from somewhere, some shelter, some sign of\nforgiveness, some hope that might bring about the end. "Lord," I vowed to\nmyself, "I will lie here, waiting and waiting, touching neither food nor\ndrink, so long as your blessing does not reach me."\n\nI heard the sound of footsteps. Who says that the gods do not show themselves\nto mortal men? I did not raise my face to look up, lest the sight of it should\nbreak the spell. Come, oh come, come and let your feet touch my head. Come,\nLord, and set your foot upon my throbbing heart, and at that moment let me\ndie.\n\nHe came and sat near my head. Who? My husband! At the first touch of his\npresence I felt that I should swoon. And then the pain at my heart burst its\nway out in an overwhelming flood of tears, tearing through all my obstructing\nveins and nerves. I strained his feet to my bosom--oh, why could not their\nimpress remain there for ever?\n\nHe tenderly stroked my head. I received his blessing. Now I shall be able to\ntake up the penalty of public humiliation which will be mine tomorrow, and\noffer it, in all sincerity, at the feet of my God.\n\nBut what keeps crushing my heart is the thought that the festive flutes which\nwere played at my wedding, nine years ago, welcoming me to this house, will\nnever sound for me again in this life. What rigour of penance is there which\ncan serve to bring me once more, as a bride adorned for her husband, to my\nplace upon that same bridal seat? How many years, how many ages, aeons, must\npass before I can find my way back to that day of nine years ago?\n\nGod can create new things, but has even He the power to create afresh that\nwhich has been destroyed?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XV](hw46.htm)\n\n'
