Now they say: 'How many (gods) does a student enter who violates the vow\nof chastity?' 1\n\n2\\. (And they answer): 'His vital spirits (go to) the Maruts (winds), his\nstrength to Indra, his eminence in sacred learning to B _ri_ haspati, all the\nremaining parts to Agni.' 2\n\n3\\. He kindles the fire in the night of the new moon, and offers, by way of\npenance, two oblations of clarified butter, 3\n\n4\\. (Reciting these two sacred texts), 'Defiled by lust am I, defiled am I, oh\nLust; to Lust svaha;' 'Injured by lust am I, injured am I, oh Lust; to Lust\nsvaha.' (Next) he (silently) places one piece of sacred fuel (on the fire),\nsprinkles water round the fire, offers the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avastu (oblation), and\napproaching (the fire) worships it, thrice (reciting the text), 'May the\nwaters sprinkle me.' 4\n\n5\\. These worlds are three; in order to conquer\n\np. 295\n\nthese worlds, in order to gain mastership over these worlds, (this rite must\nbe performed.)\n\n6\\. According to some, the above (described) rite is a penance (for all hidden\noffences) in general, (and they say) regarding it, 'He who may be impure, as\nit were, shall offer burnt-oblations in this manner, and shall recite sacred\ntexts in this manner; the fee (of the officiating priest shall be) whatever he\nmay choose.'\n\n7\\. He who has been guilty of cheating, of calumniating, of acting contrary to\nthe rule of conduct, of eating or drinking things forbidden, of connection\nwith a woman of the _S_ udra caste, of an unnatural crime, and even of\nperforming magic rites with intent (to harm his enemies), shall bathe and\nsprinkle himself with water, reciting the texts addressed to the Waters, or\nthose addressed to Varu _n_ a, or other purificatory texts. 7\n\n8\\. For offences committed by speaking or thinking of forbidden things, the\nfive Vyah _ri_ tis (must be recited). 8\n\n9\\. Or for all (offences) he may sip water, (reciting) in the morning (the\ntext), 'May the day and the sun purify me;' and in the evening, 'The night and\nVaru _n_ a.'\n\n10\\. Or he may offer eight pieces of sacred fuel, 10\n\np. 296\n\n[paragraph continues] (reciting the texts beginning) 'Devak _ri_ tasya.' By\nmerely offering them he becomes free from all sin.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[294:1](sbe0289.htm#fr_1452) **XXV**. For this and the following five Sutras,\nsee Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka II, 18, 1 seq.\n\n[294:2](sbe0289.htm#fr_1453) 'All the remaining parts, i.e. his sight and the\nother organs of sense, go to Agni. Thus a student who has broken the vow of\nchastity becomes short-lived, weak, destitute of eminence in sacred learning,\nand destitute of sight, and so forth. Therefore a penance must be performed.'\n--Haradatta. It must, of course, be understood that the penance prescribed\nhere, is a 'secret penance.'\n\n[294:3](sbe0289.htm#fr_1454) 'He, i.e. the unchaste student, shall kindle the\nfire in the night of the new moon, i.e. at midnight, in the manner declared in\nthe G _ri_ hya-sutra.'--Haradatta.\n\n[294:4](sbe0289.htm#fr_1455) Haradatta says that while sprinkling water the\nperformer shall recite the texts 'Aditi, thou hast permitted,' see \xc3\x82pastamba\nII, 2, 3, 17 note. The Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avastu oblation, which follows after the\nSvish _t_ ak _ri_ t offering, is described Gobhila G _ri_ hya-sutra I, 8,\n26-29.\n\n[295:7](sbe0289.htm#fr_1456) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 26, 7. The verses addressed to\nthe Waters are, Rv. X, 9, 1-3 = Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 1, 5, 1, and Taitt. Sa\n_m_ h. V, 6, 1. Regarding those addressed to Varu _n_ a, see above, XXIII, 28.\nAs an instance of 'other purificatory texts' Haradatta quotes Taittiriya-\nbrahma _n_ a I, 4, 81, 1.\n\n[295:8](sbe0289.htm#fr_1457) Regarding the five Vyah _ri_ tis, see above, I,\n51.\n\n[295:10](sbe0289.htm#fr_1458) Haradatta gives the following four Mantras:\nDevak _ri_ tasyainasovaya _g_ anam asi svaha, 'thou art the expiation for sin\ncommitted p. 296 by the gods,' svaha pit _ri_ k _ri_ tasyainaso . . . svaha,\nmanushyak _ri_ tasyainaso . . . svaha, asmatk _ri_ tasyainaso . . . svaha. But\nsee Va _g_ asaneyi-Sa _m_ hita VIII, 13, where eight Mantras are given, and\nbelow, XXVII, 7.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXVI](sbe0290.htm)\n\n"
