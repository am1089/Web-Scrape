It is time for my brother to come home\nfrom school.\n\nWhat has happened to you that you look so strange?\n\nHaven't you got a letter from father to-day?\n\nI saw the postman bringing letters in his bag for almost everybody in the\ntown.\n\nOnly, father's letters he keeps to read himself. I am sure the postman is a\nwicked man.\n\nBut don't be unhappy about that, mother dear.\n\nTo-morrow is market day in the next village. You ask your maid to buy some\npens and papers.\n\nI myself will write all father's letters; you will not find a single mistake.\n\nI shall write from A right up to K.\n\nBut, mother, why do you smile?\n\nYou don't believe that I can write as nicely as father does!\n\nBut I shall rule my paper carefully, and write all the letters beautifully\nbig.\n\nWhen I finish my writing, do you think I shall be so foolish as father and\ndrop it into the horrid postman's bag?\n\nI shall bring it to you myself without waiting, and letter by letter help you\nto read my writing.\n\nI know the postman does not like to give you the really nice letters.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Hero](cm33.htm)\n\n"
