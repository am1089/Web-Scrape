FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n#### A. THE VOW OF ABSTINENCE.\n\nEACH of the two half-monthly sacrifices, the regular performance of which is\nenjoined on the Brahma _n_ ical householder for a period of thirty years from\nthe time of his performance of the ceremony of agny-adhana, or setting up of a\nfire of his own,--according to some authorities even for the rest of his life\n--usually occupies the greater part of two consecutive days. Whilst the first\nday--the upavasatha or fast-day--is chiefly taken up with preparatory rites,\nsuch as the sweeping and trimming of the fire-places and lighting of the\nfires; and the formal taking of the vow of abstinence (vrata) by the\nsacrificer and his wife; the second day is reserved for the main performance\nof the sacrifice. As to the exact days of the month appointed for these\nceremonies, there is some difference of opinion among native authorities, some\nof them deciding in favour of the last two days of each half of the lunar\nmonth, whilst the generality of ritualistic writers consider the first day of\nthe half-month--or the first and sixteenth day of the month respectively--to\nbe the proper time for the main performance. The personal restrictions\ninvolved in the householder's entering on the vrata include chiefly the\nabstention from certain kinds of food, especially meat, and from other carnal\npleasures; the cutting (optional, according to some) of the beard and hair,\nexcept the crest-lock; the sleeping on the ground in one of the chief fire-\nhouses; and the observance of silence during the ceremonies. It was, however,\npermitted to compress the two-days'\n\np. 2\n\nrites of the Full-moon sacrifice into one single day, in which case some of\nthese restrictions would of course not be applicable.\n\nThe ceremonies begin with the preparation of the sacrificial fires. [First,\nthe fivefold lustration successively of the \xc3\x82havaniya and Dakshi _n_ agni\nfire-places, to render them fit for receiving the fire from the Garhapatya or\nhouseholder's fire, viz. by thrice sweeping the hearths; thrice besmearing\nthem with gomaya; drawing three lines across them from west to east, or south\nto north, with the wooden sword (sphya); removing the dust from the lines with\nthe thumb and ring-finger; and thrice sprinkling the lines with water 1.] Then\nthe Adhvaryu performs the agny-uddhara _n_ a, or twice taking out of the fire\nfrom the Garhapatya, and putting it successively on the forepart of the\n\xc3\x82havaniya and Dakshi _n_ agni hearths. After this takes place the agny-\nanvadhana, or putting (fuel) on the fires, by either the householder or the\nAdhvaryu; two logs being put on each of the three fires. This may be done in\nthree different ways, viz. first on the \xc3\x82havaniya, then on the Garhapatya, and\nlast on the Dakshi _n_ agni, in which case the first log is put on by him\nwhilst muttering the verse Rig-veda X, 128, 1 (Taitt. S. IV, 7, 14, 1), 'Let\nthere be lustre, O Agni, at my invocations!' &c., the second log silently. Or\nthe first logs are put on with one of the three mystical words 'bhur, bhuva\n_h_ , svar' on the Garhapatya, Dakshi _n_ agni, and \xc3\x82havaniya successively,\nand the second logs again silently. Or both logs may be put on silently, the\norder of fires being in that case the one in which they originate, viz.\nGarhapatya, \xc3\x82havaniya, and Dakshi _n_ agni.\n\nIn the afternoon the householder and his wife partake of the vratopaniya or\nfast-day food (prepared chiefly of rice, barley, or mudga beans) with\nclarified butter; whereupon they take the vow in the manner prescribed in the\nBrahma _n_ a. In the evening, immediately after sunset, and on the following\nmorning just before sunrise, the householder has, as usual, to perform the\nAgnihotra, a burnt-offering of fresh milk, which has to be made by him twice\ndaily, with certain exceptions, from the Agnyadhana to the end of his life.\n\n\n\n1:1:1:11\\. He who is about to enter on the vow, touches water 2 whilst\nstanding between the \xc3\x82havaniya\n\np. 3\n\nand Garhapatya fires, with his face turned towards east. The reason why he\ntouches water is, that man is (sacrificially) impure on account of his\nspeaking untruth; and because by that act an internal purification (is\neffected),--for water is indeed (sacrificially) pure. 'After becoming\nsacrificially pure, I will enter on the vow,' thus (he thinks); for water is\nindeed purifying. 'Having become purified through the purifying one, I will\nenter on the vow,' thus (he thinks, and) this is the reason why he touches\nwater.\n\n1:1:1:22\\. Looking towards the (\xc3\x82havaniya) fire 1, he enters on the vow, with\nthe text (Va _g_. S. I, 5 a): 'O Agni, Lord of Vows! I will keep the vow! may\nI be equal to it, may I succeed in it!' For Agni is Lord of Vows to the gods,\nand it is to him therefore that he addresses these words. In the words, 'I\nwill observe the vow; may I be equal to it; may I succeed in it,' there is\nnothing that requires explanation.\n\n1:1:1:33\\. After the completion (of the sacrifice) he divests himself (of the\nvow), with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 28 a), 'O Agni, Lord of Vows! I have kept\nthe vow; I have been equal to it; I have succeeded in\n\np. 4\n\nit;' for he who has attained the completion of the sacrifice, has indeed been\nequal to it; and he who has attained the completion of the sacrifice, has\nsucceeded in it. It is in this way that most (sacrificers) will probably enter\non the vow; but one may also enter on it in the following way.\n\n1:1:1:44\\. Twofold, verily, is this, there is no third, viz. truth and\nuntruth. And verily the gods are the truth, and man is the untruth. Therefore\nin saying (Va _g_. S. I, 5 b), 'I now enter from untruth into truth,' he\npasses from the men to the gods 1.\n\n1:1:1:55\\. Let him then only speak what is true; for this vow indeed the gods\ndo keep, that they speak the truth; and for this reason they are glorious:\nglorious therefore is he who, knowing this, speaks the truth.\n\n1:1:1:66\\. After the completion (of the sacrifice) he divests himself (of the\nvow), with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 28 b): 'Now I am he who I really am.' For,\nin entering upon the vow, he becomes, as it were, nonhuman; and as it would\nnot be becoming for him to say, 'I enter from truth into untruth;' and as, in\nfact, he now again becomes man, let him therefore divest himself (of the vow),\nwith the text: 'Now I am he who I really am.'\n\n1:1:1:77\\. Now then of the eating (or) fasting 2. And on this point \xc3\x82sha _dh_\na Savayasa, on the one hand, was of opinion that the vow consisted in fasting.\nFor assuredly, (he argued,) the gods see through the mind of man; they know\nthat, when he enters on this\n\np. 5\n\nvow, he means to sacrifice to them the next morning. Therefore all the gods\nbetake themselves to his house, and abide by (him or the fires, upa-vas) in\nhis house; whence this (day) is called upa-vasatha 1.\n\n1:1:1:88\\. Now, as it would even be unbecoming for him to take food, before\nmen (who are staying with him as his guests) have eaten; how much more would\nit be so, if he were to take food before the gods (who are staying with him)\nhave eaten: let him therefore take no food at all.\n\n1:1:1:99\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, on the other hand, said: 'If he does not eat,\nhe thereby becomes a sacrificer to the Manes; and if he does eat, he eats\nbefore the gods have eaten: let him therefore eat what, when eaten, counts as\nnot eaten.' For that of which no offering is made, even though it is eaten, is\nconsidered as not eaten. When he therefore eats, he does not become a\nsacrificer to the Manes; and by eating of that of which no offering is made,\nhe does not eat before the gods have eaten.\n\n1:1:1:1010\\. Let him therefore eat only what grows in the forest, be it forest\nplants or the fruit of trees. And in regard to this point Barku Varsh _n_ a\nsaid: 'Cook ye beans for me, for no offering is made of them!' This, however,\nhe should not do; for pulse\n\np. 6\n\nserves as an addition to rice and barley; and hence he increases the rice and\nbarley by means of it: let him therefore eat only what grows in the forest.\n\n1:1:1:1111\\. Let him sleep that night in the house of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire or in\nthe house of the Garhapatya fire. For he who enters on the vow approaches the\ngods; and he sleeps in the midst of those very gods whom he approaches. Let\nhim sleep on the ground 1; for from below, as it were, one serves one's\nsuperior.\n\nB. THE PREPARATION OF THE OFFERINGS.\n\nAfter the morning's performance of the Agnihotra and the subsequent rising of\nthe sun, the sacrificer chooses his Brahman, or superintending priest. [In the\nfirst place he gets six seats ready, covered with sacrificial grass: two of\nthese, to be used by the Brahman and sacrificer during the ceremony of\nelection, are placed somewhere on the north side of the sacrificial ground;\nanother south of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, to serve for the Brahman's permanent seat\n(brahmasadanam), and west of the latter (placed so as to be quite close to the\naltar to be constructed hereafter, cf. Katy. _S_ r. I, 8, 28), the\nsacrificer's permanent seat; finally a seat north of each of the two fires,\nthe Garhapatya and the \xc3\x82havaniya, to be used by the Adhvaryu on certain\noccasions. The sacrificer and future Brahman then having seated themselves on\nthe two first-mentioned seats on the north side, the former with his face\nturned northward, and the latter looking toward east; the sacrificer, holding\nthe wooden sword (sphya) in his left hand, touches the right knee of the\nBrahman with his right hand, in which he holds barley-corns and] chooses him\nfor his Brahman with the formula: ['Thou, of such and such a family, N.N. _S_\narman! we are about to perform the Full-moon sacrifice,'] 'O Lord of the\nearth! Lord of the world! Lord of the great universe! we choose thee for our\nBrahman!' The chosen one then mutters (cf. Va _g_. S. p. 57): 'I am the lord\nof the earth, I lord of the world, I lord of the great universe (mahabhuta)!\nearth! ether! heaven! O God Savit _ri_ , thee they choose for their Brahman,\ntheir lord of prayer (B _ri_ haspati)!' &c., 'B _ri_ haspati is Brahman to the\ngods, I to the men!' He (or, according\n\np. 7\n\nto some, the sacrificer) further says, 'O Lord of speech, protect the\nsacrifice!' after which he betakes himself to the Brahman's seat (south of the\n\xc3\x82havaniya), and whilst [standing north of it, with his face turned eastward\nand] looking on it, he mutters: 'Avaunt! unholy one (daidhishavya, lit. son of\na re-married woman)! take thee away from here and seat thee on another's seat\nwho is less exalted (pakatara) than we!' He takes one blade of grass from the\nseat and flings it towards south-west (the region of the Rakshas or evil\nspirits) with the formula: 'Expelled is sin with him whom we detest!' and then\nsits down with the formula 'Here I sit on the seat of B _ri_ haspati, at the\ncommand of the divine Savit _ri_! This I proclaim to the fire, this to the\nwind, this to the earth!' Here he remains seated, with his face towards the\n\xc3\x82havaniya fire, to watch the progress of the ceremony and give directions,\nwhenever he is appealed to. When the full or new-moon sacrifice is performed\nfor the first time, it should be preceded by the Anvarambha _n_ iya offering,\nperformed in much the same way as the Paur _n_ amasi, except that the\noblations themselves consist of a rice cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and\nVish _n_ u, a potful of boiled (rice) grains ( _k_ aru) for Sarasvati; and a\nrice cake on twelve potsherds for Sarasvat; the priest's fee on this occasion\nconsisting of a cow four years old, or a pair of cattle, instead of the\nAnvaharya mess. Katy. _S_ r. IV, 5, 22-23.\n\n1:1:1:1212\\. By way of his first act on the following morning he (the Adhvaryu\npriest) betakes himself to the water, and brings water forward 1: for\n\np. 8\n\nwater is (one of the means of) sacrifice. Hence by this his first act he\napproaches (engages in) the sacrifice; and by bringing (water) forward, he\nspreads out (prepares) the sacrifice.\n\n1:1:1:1313\\. He brings it forward with those mysterious words (Va _g_. S. I,\n6): 'Who (or Pra _g_ apati) joins (or yokes) thee (to this fire) 1? He joins\nthee. For what (or, for Pra _g_ apati) does he join thee? For that (or him) he\njoins thee!' For Pra _g_ apati is undefined 2 (mysterious); Pra _g_ apati is\nthe sacrifice: hence he thereby yokes (gets ready for the performance) Pra _g_\napati, this sacrifice.\n\n1:1:1:1414\\. The reason why he brings forward water is, that all this\n(universe) is pervaded by water 3; hence by this his first act he pervades (or\ngains) all this (universe).\n\n1:1:1:1515\\. And whatever here in this (sacrifice) the Hot _ri_ , or the\nAdhvaryu, or the Brahman, or the \xc3\x82gnidhra, or the sacrificer himself, does not\nsucceed in accomplishing, all that is thereby obtained (or made good).\n\n1:1:1:1616\\. Another reason why he brings forward water is this: whilst the\ngods were engaged in performing sacrifice, the Asuras and Rakshas forbade\n(raksh)\n\np. 9\n\nthem, saying, 'Ye shall not sacrifice!' and because they forbade (raksh), they\nare called Rakshas.\n\n1:1:1:1717\\. The gods then perceived this thunderbolt, to wit, the water: the\nwater is a thunderbolt, for the water is indeed a thunderbolt; hence wherever\nit goes, it produces a hollow (or depression of ground); and whatever it comes\nnear, it destroys (lit. it burns up). Thereupon they took up that thunderbolt,\nand in its safe and foeless shelter they spread (performed) the sacrifice. And\nthus he (the Adhvaryu priest) likewise takes up this thunderbolt, and in its\nsafe and foeless shelter spreads the sacrifice. This is the reason why he\nbrings forward water.\n\n1:1:1:1818\\. After pouring out some of it (into the jug) he puts it down north\nof the Garhapatya fire. For water (ap) is female and fire (agni) is male; and\nthe Garhapatya is a house: hence a copulation productive of offspring is\nthereby effected in this house. Now he who brings forward the water, takes up\na thunderbolt; but when he takes up the thunderbolt, he cannot do so unless he\nis firmly placed; for otherwise it destroys him.\n\n1:1:1:1919\\. The reason then why he places it near the Garhapatya fire is,\nthat the Garhapatya is a house, and a house is a safe resting-place; so that\nhe thereby stands firmly in a house, and therefore in a safe resting-place: in\nthis way that thunderbolt does not destroy him,--for this reason he places it\nnear the Garhapatya fire.\n\n1:1:1:2020\\. He then carries it north of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire 1. For water is\nfemale and fire is male: hence\n\np. 10\n\na copulation productive of offspring is thereby effected. And in this way\nalone a regular copulation can take place, since the woman lies on the left\n(or north) side of the man.\n\n1:1:1:2121\\. Let nobody pass between the water (and the fire), lest by passing\nbetween them he should disturb the copulation which is taking place. Let him\nset the water down without carrying it beyond (the north side of the fire,\ni.e. not on the eastern side); nor should he put it down before reaching (the\nnorth side, i.e. not on the western side). For, if he were to put the water\ndown after carrying it beyond,--there being, as it were, a great rivalry\nbetween fire and water,--he would cause this rivalry to break forth on the\npart of the fire; and when they (the priests and the sacrificer) touch the\nwater of this (vessel), he would, by carrying it and setting it down beyond\n(the northern side), cause the enemy to rise (spirt) in the fire. If, on the\nother hand, he were to put it down before gaining (the northern side), he\nwould not gain by it the fulfilment of the wish for which it has been brought\nforward. Let him therefore put it down exactly north of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire.\n\n1:1:1:2222\\. He now strews sacrificial grass all round (the fires) 1, and\nfetches the utensils, taking two at a\n\np. 11\n\ntime, viz. the winnowing basket and the Agnihotra ladle, the wooden sword and\nthe potsherds, the wedge and the black antelope skin, the mortar and the\npestle, the large and the small mill-stones. These are ten in number; for of\nten syllables consists the Vira _g_ (metre), and radiant (vira _g_ )\n[1](sbe1204.htm#fn_96) also is the sacrifice: so that he thereby makes the\nsacrifice resemble the Vira _g_. The reason why he takes two at a time is,\nbecause a pair means strength; for when two undertake anything, there is\nstrength in it. Moreover, a pair represents a productive copulation, so that a\nproductive copulation (of those respective objects) is thereby effected.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[2:1](sbe1203.htm#fr_83) The statements enclosed in brackets [ ] are drawn\nfrom the comments and Paddhati on Katyayana's _S_ rauta-sutra.\n\n[2:2](sbe1203.htm#fr_84) I.e. 'he dips his hand into water contained in a\nvessel,' Schol. Katy. _S_ r. S. I, 10, 14. According to the general rule there\ngiven, p. 3 the same purificatory act has to be repeated whenever, in the\ncourse of ceremonial performances, a sacrificial formula or prayer has been\nused, which is addressed to, or directed against, Rudra, the Rakshas and\nAsuras, and the Manes; or one directed against some specified enemy of the\nsacrificer with the view of exorcising or averting the evil influences with\nwhich the latter is supposed to be threatened from that quarter; or lastly,\nwhen a touching of one's self has taken place, either accidentally or as part\nof the ceremonial.\n\n[3:1](sbe1203.htm#fr_85) 'Stepping between the Garhapatya and Dakshi _n_ a\nfires (aparagni), and standing west of the \xc3\x82havaniya, with his face turned\neastward and looking at the fire.' Katy. _S_ r. S. II, 1, 11.\n\n[4:1](sbe1203.htm#fr_86) I.e. 'he obtains a divine body (devata _s_ ariram),'\nMahidh.; man's existence is untruth on account of its perishableness,' id.\n\n[4:2](sbe1203.htm#fr_87) The discussion which here follows refers to the\nevening meal which the sacrificer is allowed to take after he has performed\nthe Agnihotra. Cf. Katy. _S_ r. S. II, 1, 13.\n\n[5:1](sbe1203.htm#fr_88) The primary meaning of upa-vas probably is 'to dwell\nor abide near (? the gods or fires);' its secondary and technical meaning\nbeing 'to fast,' whence upavasatha, 'a fasting or fast-day,' literally 'the\nabiding near (? or honouring, the gods or fires).' Cf. III, 9, 2, 7. The term\nis more usually applied to the preliminary fast-day of the Soma-sacrifice; but\nthe latter being considered the most solemn and efficacious of sacrificial\nrites, a strong tendency prevails to establish some kind of connection between\nit and the other ceremonies. Cf. Katy. _S_ r. S. IV, 15, 36.\n\n[6:1](sbe1203.htm#fr_89) A shake-down of grass (astara _n_ am,? a blanket) is\nnot forbidden. Paddh. on Katy. _S_ r. II, 1.\n\n[7:1](sbe1203.htm#fr_90) He, in the first place, pours water into a jug\n[usually made of vara _n_ a wood (Crataeva Roxburghii), four-cornered, about a\nspan or twelve fingers' breadths deep and four fingers' breadths square, and\nfurnished with a handle], puts it down north of the Garhapatya fire, and\ntouches it with the formula: 'I, the existent, will operate with thee (?tva\nkarishyami), O existent one!' He then addresses himself to the Brahman: 'O\nBrahman! shall I bring the water forward?' and to the patron or sacrificer:\n'Sacrificer, restrain thy speech!' The Brahman,---after muttering the mantra\n(as he does, with certain modifications, on similar occasions when his\npermission is asked in the course of the performance): 'Lead on the sacrifice!\ngladden the deities! May the sacrificer be on the vault of heaven! Where the\nworld of the seven pious _Ri_ shis is, thither do thou lead this sacrifice and\nsacrificer!'--replies aloud: 'Hail (om)! bring forward!'\n\n[8:1](sbe1203.htm#fr_91) 'Ka (i.e. who? or Pra _g_ apati) joins thee (i.e.\nplaces thee, O water, by the side of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire)? (I) . . _K_ asmai\n(i.e. for what purpose? or, for whom? or, for Pra _g_ apati) does he join\nthee? (!)' Mahidh. Dark is the meaning of these words because of the ambiguity\nof ka, the interrogative pronoun, which speculative theology also takes for a\nmystic name of Pra _g_ apati. Cf. XI, 5, 4, seq.; Max Muller, History of\nAncient Sanskrit Literature, p. 433.\n\n[8:2](sbe1203.htm#fr_92) Cf. also I, 6, 1, 20, where Saya _n_ a says that Pra\n_g_ apati is anirukta, because he represents all deities.\n\n[8:3](sbe1203.htm#fr_93) A play on the word apa _h_ (ap), 'water,' and the\nroot ap, 'to obtain, to pervade.'\n\n[9:1](sbe1203.htm#fr_94) After the water has been brought forward by the\nAdhvaryu from the house of the Garhapatya fire, its technical name is Pra _n_\nita _h_ , p. 10 'brought forward.' On putting it down north of the \xc3\x82havaniya,\nhe covers the jug over with sacrificial grass.\n\n[10:1](sbe1203.htm#fr_95) Katy. _S_ r. II, 3, 6: 'Having strewn sacrificial\ngrass around the fires, beginning on the east side,' which the Comm.\ninterprets: 'He strews eastward and northward-pointed grass around first the\n\xc3\x82havaniya, then the Garhapatya, and last the Dakshi _n_ agni, beginning each\ntime on the eastern side, and then moving around from left to right, and\nturning his right side towards the fire, so as to end on the north side' (cf.\nKaty. IV, 13, 15). The Paddhati, on p. 11 the other hand, following \xc3\x82pastamba,\ninterprets it to the effect that on the eastern and western sides he strews\nthe grass with its tops turned northward, and on the southern and northern\nsides with the tops turned eastward.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 2.
