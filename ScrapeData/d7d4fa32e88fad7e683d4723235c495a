Stand upright for us, O Agni, Hot _ri_ of the sacrifice, the best\nperformer of sacrifices among the gods. For thou art the master of every\nthought; thou promotest the worshipper's prayer.\n\n2\\. The unerring Hot _ri_ has sat down among the people, joy-giving Agni, the\nwise one at the sacrifices [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:2:1). Like Savit _ri_ he\nhas sent his light upward. Like a builder he has reared his smoke up to the\nsky.\n\n3 [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:3:1). (The ladle) glowing, filled with gifts, with\nbutter, is stretched forth. From left to right (does Agni move) choosing the\ndivine people. Upright (stands) the (sacrificial) post like a new-born foal\n[2](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:3:2); well-placed, well-established it anoints the\nvictims [3](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:3:3).\n\n4\\. After the sacrificial grass has been spread and the fire kindled, the\ndelighted Adhvaryu has stationed himself upright. Agni, the Hot _ri_ , chosen\nfrom of old, goes round thrice, like a shepherd.\n\n5\\. As Hot _ri_ , measuredly running, Agni, the joy-giving, sweet-tongued, the\nrighteous, goes around by his own might. His flames run forward like race-\nhorses; all beings are afraid when he has shone forth.\n\n6\\. Beautiful, O fair-faced Agni, is thy aspect, who art terrible and\nmanifold; pleasant (it is). As they have not hindered thy light by darkness,\nno bespatterers have left stains on thy body.\n\n7\\. He whose mother (?) [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:7:1) has not been hindered\nfrom giving birth, nor his father and mother whenever\n\np. 341\n\nthey were incited (?) [2](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:7:2): this Agni, the purifier,\nwell-established like Mitra [3](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:7:3), has shone among the\ntribes of men,--\n\n8\\. Agni, whom the twice-five sisters [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:8:1), dwelling\ntogether, have engendered among the human tribes, who awakes at dawn, who is\nbright like an elephant's (?) [2](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:8:2) tooth, whose mouth\nis beautiful, who is sharp like an axe.\n\n9 [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:9:1). Agni, those golden horses of thine swimming in\nghee, the red ones which go straight forward, the fleet ones, the brilliant,\nmanly, wonderful horses, puissant stallions, have called hither the divine\npeople.\n\n10\\. Those victorious, never-tiring [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:10:1), fierce\nflames of thine, O Agni, which move about, hasten\n[2](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:10:2) to their goal like hawks; they roar mightily\nlike the host of the Maruts.\n\n11 [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:11:1). (This) hymn has been produced for thee, O\nAgni, when thou wert kindled. May (the priest) recite the litany; mayst thou\ndistribute (treasures) to him who sacrifices. Men have set down Agni as the\nHot _ri_ , the U _s_ i _g_ s, adoring (Him), the praise of \xc3\x82yu\n[2](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:11:2).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 6 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 1.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The text has vidatheshu. Cf. above, I, 31, 6 note.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. With the first hemistich compare above, III, 19, 2. See also VI, 63,\n4.\n\np. 342\n\nNote 2. On akra, see Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 168.\n\nNote 3. The meaning seems to be that the sacrificial post, which has been\nanointed itself, imparts ointment to the victim tied to it.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. The meaning of sa\xc2\xb4tu is uncertain. Boehtlingk-Roth give\n'receptaculum.' Joh. Schmidt (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV, p. 29, cf. Hubschmann,\nIndogerm. Vocalsystem, p. 75) translates 'Mutterleib,' and connects the word\nwith stri\xc2\xb4. If 'womb' is right, it seems to be the womb from which Agni was\nborn.\n\nNote 2. Does this ish _t_ au belong to ish, 'to incite,' or to ish, 'to wish'?\n'Whenever he (Agni) wishes.' M. M.\n\nNote 3. On the well-established Mitra, comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 186,\nnote 1.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The ten sisters of course are the fingers.\n\nNote 2. In translating athary\xcc\x83a _h_ na dantam I have followed the opinion of\nPischel (Vedische Studien, I, 99) on the meaning of athari\xc2\xb4 though his theory\nis very doubtful.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. With this description of Agni's horses, comp. above, IV, 2, 2. 3.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. On aya\xc2\xb4sa _h_ , cf. above, III, 18, 2, note 1.\n\nNote 2. See Geldner, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, 234.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. The second hemistich of this verse is nearly identical with V, 3, 4.\n\nNote 2. Cf. nara _s_ a _m_ sa, vol. xxxii, p. 439.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 7](sbe46096.htm)\n\n"
