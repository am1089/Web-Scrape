Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# RAMAYANA BOOK VII\n\n# KISHKINDHA\n\n_\n\n(In the Nilgiri Mountains)\n\n_\n\nRAMA\'S wanderings in the Nilgiri mountains, and his alliance with Sugriva the\nchief of these regions, form the subject of the Book. With that contempt for\naboriginal races which has marked civilized conquerors in all ages, the poet\ndescribes the dwellers of these regions as monkeys and bears. But the modern\nreader sees through these strange epithets; and in the description of the\nsocial and domestic manners, the arts and industries, the sacred rites and\nceremonies, and the civic and political life of the Vanars, the reader will\nfind that the poet even imports Aryan customs into his account of the dwellers\nof Southern India. They formed an alliance with Rama, they fought for him and\ntriumphed with him, and they helped him to recover his wife from the king of\nCeylon.\n\nThe portions translated in this Book from Sections v., xv., xvi., xxvi., a\nportion of Section xxviii., and an abstract of Sections xl. to xliii. of Book\niv. of the original text.\n\n## I\n\n## FRIENDS IN MISFORTUNE\n\nLong and loud lamented Rama by his lonesome cottage door,  \nJanasthana\'s woodlands answered, Panchavati\'s echoing shore,\n\nLong he searched in wood and jungle, mountain crest and pathless plain,  \nTill he reached the Malya mountains stretching to the southern main.\n\nThere Sugriva king of Vanars, Hanuman his henchman brave,  \nBanished from their home and empire lived within the forest cave,\n\nTo the exiled king Sugriva, Hanuman his purpose told,  \nAs he marked the pensive Rama wand\'ring with his brother bold:\n\n"Mark the sons of Dasa-ratha banished from their royal home,  \nDuteous to their father\'s mandate in these pathless forests roam,\n\nGreat was monarch Dasa-ratha famed for sacrifice divine,  \n_Raja-suya_ , _Aswa-medha_ , and for gift of gold and kine,\n\nBy a monarch\'s stainless duty people\'s love the monarch won,  \nBy a woman\'s false contrivance banished he his eldest son!\n\nTrue to duty, true to virtue, Rama passed his forest life,  \nTill a false perfidious Raksha stole his fair and faithful wife,\n\nAnd the anguish-stricken husband seeks thy friendship and thy aid,  \nMutual sorrow blends your fortunes, be ye friends in mutual need!"\n\nBold Sugriva heard the counsel, and to righteous Rama hied,  \nAnd the princes of Ayodhya with his greetings gratified:\n\n"Well I know thee, righteous Rama, soul of piety and love,  \nAnd thy duty to thy father and thy faith in God above,\n\n_\n\nFortune favours poor Sugriva, Rama courts his humble aid,  \nIn our deepest direst danger he our truest friendship made!\n\nEqual is our fateful fortune,--I have lost a queenly wife,  \nBanished from, Kishkindha\'s empire here I lead a forest life,\n\nPledge of love and true alliance, Rama, take this proffered hand,  \nBanded by a common sorrow we shall fall or stoutly stand.!"\n\n_\n\nRama grasped the hand lie offered, and the tear was in his eye,  \nAnd they swore undying friendship o\'er the altar blazing high,\n\nHanuman with fragrant blossoms sanctified the sacred rite,  \nAnd the comrades linked by sorrow walked around the altar\'s light,\n\nAnd their word and troth they plighted: "In our happiness and woe  \nWe are friends in thought and action, we will f ace our common foe!"\n\nAnd they broke a leafy _Sal_ tree, spread it underneath their feet,  \nRama and his friend Sugriva sat upon the common seat,\n\nAnd a branch of scented _Chandan_ with its tender blossoms graced,  \nHanuman as seat of honour for the faithful Lakshman placed.\n\n"Listen, Rama," spake Sugriva, "reft of kingdom, reft of wife,  \nFleeing to these rugged mountains I endure a forest life,\n\nFor my tyrant brother Bali rules Kishkindha all alone,  \nForced my wife from my embraces, drove me from my father\'s throne,\n\nTrembling in my fear and anguish I endure a life of woe,  \nRender me my wife and empire from my brother and my foe!"\n\n"Not in vain they seek my succour," so the gallant Rama said,  \n"Who with love and offered friendship seek my counsel and my aid,\n\nNot in vain these glistening arrows in my ample quiver shine,  \nBali dies the death of tyrants, wife and empire shall be thine!\n\n_\n\nQuick as INDRA\'S fork ed lightning are these arrows feather-plumed,  \nDeadly as the hissing serpent are these darts with points illumed,\n\nAnd this day shall not be ended ere it sees thy brotherfall,  \nAs by lurid lightning severed sinks the crest of mountain tall!"\n\n_\n\n## II.\n\n## THE COUNSEL OF TARA\n\nLinked in bonds of faithful friendship Rama and Sugriva came,  \nWhere in royal town Kishkindha, Bali ruled with warlike fame,\n\nAnd a shout like troubled ocean\'s or like tempest\'s deafening roar  \nSpake Sugriva\'s mighty challenge to the victor king once more!\n\nBali knew that proud defiance shaking sky and solid ground,  \nAnd like sun by eclipse shaded, dark and pale he looked around,\n\nAnd his teeth were set in anger and a passion lit his eye,  \nAs a tempest stirs a torrent when its lilies scattered lie,\n\nAnd he rose in wrath terrific with a thought of vengeance dread,  \nAnd the firm earth shook and trembled \'neath his proud and haughty tread!\n\nBut the true and tender Tara held her husband and her lord,  \nAnd a woman\'s deeper wisdom spake in woman\'s loving word:\n\nWherefore like a rain-fed torrent swells thy passion in its sway,  \nThoughts of wrath like withered blossoms from thy bosom cast away,\n\nWait till dawns another morning, wait till thou dost truly know,  \nWith what strength and added forces comes again thy humbled foe.\n\nCrushed in combat faint Sugriva fled in terror and in pain,  \nTrust me, not without a helper comes he to the fight again,\n\nTrust me, lord, that loud defiance is no coward\'s falt\'ring cry,  \nConscious strength not hesitation speaks in voice so proud and high!\n\nMuch my woman\'s heart misgives me, not without a mighty aid,  \nNot without a daring comrade comes Sugriva to this raid,\n\nNot with feeble friend Sugriva seeks alliance in his need,  \nNor invokes a powerless chieftain in his lust and in his greed.\n\nMighty is his royal comrade,--listen, husband, to my word,  \nWhat my son in forest confines from his messengers hath heard,--\n\nPrinces from Ayodhya\'s country peerless in the, art of war,  \nRama and the valiant Lakshman in these forests wander far,\n\nMuch I fear, these matchless warriors have their aid and counsel lent  \nConscious of his strength Sugriva bath this proud defiance sent!\n\nTo his foes resistless Rama is a lightning from above,  \nTo his friends a tree of shelter, soul of tenderness and love,\n\nDearer than his love of glory is his love to heal and bless,  \nDearer than the crown and empire is his hermit\'s holy dress,\n\nNot with such, my lord and husband, seek a vain unrighteous strife,  \nFor, like precious ores in mountains, virtues dwell in Rama\'s life.\n\nMake Sugriva thy companion, make him Regent and thy Heir,  \nDiscord with a younger brother rends an empire broad and fair,\n\nMake thy peace with young Sugriva, nearest and thy dearest kin,  \nBrother\'s love is truest safety, brother\'s hate is deadliest sin!\n\nTrust me, monarch of Kishkindha, trust thy true and faithful wife,  \nThou shalt find no truer comrade than Sugriva in thy life,\n\nWage not then a war fraternal, smite him not in sinful pride,  \nAs a brother and a warrior let him stand by Bali\'s side.\n\nListen to thy Tara\'s counsel if to thee is Tara dear,  \nIf thy wife is true in duty scorn not Tara\'s wifely tear,\n\nNot with Rama prince of virtue wage a combat dread and high,  \nNot with Rama prince of valour, peerless like the Lord of sky!"\n\n## III\n\n## THE FALL OF BALI\n\nStar-eyed Tara softly counselled pressing to her consort\'s side,  \nMighty Bali proudly answered with a warrior\'s lofty pride:\n\n"Challenge of a humbled foeman and a younger\'s haugty scorn  \nMay not, shall not, tender Tara, by a king be meekly borne!\n\nBali turns not from encounter even with his dying breath,  \nInsult from a foe, unanswered, is a deeper stain than death,\n\nAnd Sugriva\'s quest for combat Bali never shall deny,  \nThough sustained by Rama\'s forces and by Rama\'s prowess high!\n\nFree me from thy sweet embraces and amidst thy maids retire,  \nWoman\'s love and soft devotion woman\'s timid thoughts inspire,\n\nFear not, Tara, blood of brother Bali\'s honour shall not stain,  \nI will quell his proud presumption, chase him from this realm again,\n\nFree me from thy loving dalliance, midst thy damsels seek thy place,  \nTill I come a happy victor to my Tara\'s fond embrace!"\n\nSlow and sad with sweet obeisance Tara stopped around her lord,  \nWelling tear-drops choked her accents as she prayed in stifled word,\n\nSlow and sad with swelling bosom Tara with her maids retired,  \nBali issued proud and stately with the thought of vengeance fired!\n\nHissing like an angry cobra, city\'s lofty gates he past,  \nAnd his proud and angry glances fiercely all around he cast,\n\nTill he saw the bold Sugriva, gold-complexioned, red with ire,  \nGirded for the dubious combat, flaming like the forest fire!\n\nBali braced his warlike garments and his hand he lifted high,  \nBold Sugriva raised his right arm with a proud and answering cry,\n\nBali\'s eyes were red as copper and his chain was burnished gold,  \nTo his brother bold Sugriva thus he spake in accents bold:\n\n"Mark this iron fist, intruder, fatal is its vengeful blow,  \nCrushed and smitten thou shalt perish and to nether world shalt go,"\n\n"Nay that fate awaits thee, Bali," spake Sugriva armed for strife,  \n"When this right arm smites thy forehead, from thy bosom rends thy life!"\n\nClosed the chiefs in fatal combat, each resistless in his pride,  \nAnd like running rills from mountains poured their limbs the purple tide,\n\nTill Sugriva quick uprooting _Sal_ tree from the jungle wood,  \nAs the dark cloud hurls the lightning, hurled it where his brother stood,\n\nStaggering \'neath the blow terrific Bali reeled and almost fell,  \nAs a proud ship overladen reels upon the ocean\'s swell!\n\nBut with fiercer rage and fury Bali in his anguish rose,  \nAnd with mutual blows they battled,--brothers and relentless foes,\n\nLike the sun and moon in conflict or like eagles in their fight,  \nStill they fought with cherished hatred and an unforgotten spite,\n\nTill with mightier force and fury Bali did his younger quell,  \nFaint Sugriva fiercely struggling \'neath his brother\'s prowess fell!\n\nStill the wrathful rivals wrestled with their bleeding arms and knees,  \nWith their nails like claws of tigers and with riven rocks and trees,\n\nAnd as INDRA battles Vritra in the tempest\'s pealing roar,  \nBlood-stained Bali, red Sugriva, strove and struggled, fought and tore,\n\nTill Sugriva faint and falt\'ring fell like Vritra from the sky,  \nTo his comrade and his helper turned his faint and pleading eye!\n\nAh! those soft and pleading glances smote the gentle Rama\'s heart,  \nOn his bow of ample stature Rama raised the fatal dart,\n\nLike the fatal disc of YAMA was his proudly circled bow,  \nLike a snake of deadly poison flew his arrow swift and low,\n\nWinged dwellers of the forest heard the twang with trembling few,  \nEchoing woods gave back the accent, lightly fled the startled deer,\n\nAnd as INDRA\'S flag is lowered when the Aswin winds prevail,  \nLofty Bali pierced and bleeding by that fatal arrow fell!\n\n## IV\n\n## THE CONSECRATION OF SUGRIVA\n\nTears of love the tender Tara on her slaughtered hero shed,  \nE\'en Sugriva\'s bosom melted when he saw his brother dead,\n\nAnd each Vanar chief and warrior, _maha-matra_ , lord and peer,  \nGathered round the sad Sugriva wet with unavailing tear!\n\nAnd they girt the victor Rama and they praised his wond\'rous might,  \nAs the heavenly _rishis_ gather circling BRAHMA\'S throne of light,\n\nHanuman of sun-like radiance, lofty as a hill of gold,  \nClasped his hands in due obeisance, spake in accents calm and bold:\n\n"By thy prowess, peerless Rama, prince Sugriva is our lord,  \nTo his father\'s throne and empire, to his father\'s town restored,\n\nCleansed b bath and fragrant unguents and in royal garments gay,  \nHe shall with his gold and garlands homage to the victor pay,\n\nTo the rock-bound fair Kishkindha do thy friendly footsteps bend,  \nAnd as monarch of the Vanars consecrate thy grateful friend!"\n\n"Fourteen years," so Rama answered, "by his father\'s stem command,  \nIn a city\'s sacred confines banished Rama may not stand,\n\nFriend and comrade, brave Sugriva, enter thou the city wall,  \nAnd assume the royal sceptre in thy father\'s royal hall.\n\nGallant Angad, son of Bali, is in regal duties trained,  \nRuling partner of thy empire be the valiant prince ordained,\n\nEldest son of eldest brother,--such the maxim that we own,--  \nWorthy of his father\'s kingdom, doth ascend his father\'s throne.\n\nListen! \'tis the month of _Sravan_ , now begins the yearly rain,  \nIn these months of wind and deluge thoughts of vengeful strife were vain,\n\nEnter then thy royal city, fair Kishkindha be thy home,  \nWith my ever faithful Lakshman let me in these mountains roam.\n\nSpacious is yon rocky cavern fragrant with the mountain air,  \nBright with lily and with lotus, watered by a streamlet fair,\n\nHere we dwell till month of _Kartik_ when the clouded sky will clear,  \nAnd the time of war and vengeance on our foeman shall be near."\n\nBowing to the victor\'s mandate brave Sugriva marched in state,  \nAnd the host of thronging Vanars entered by the city gate,\n\nProstrate chiefs with due obeisance rendered homage, one and all,  \nAnd Sugriva blessed his people, stepped within the palace hall.\n\nAnd they sprinkled sacred water from the vases jewel-graced,  \nAnd they waved the fan of _chowri_ , raised the sun-shade silver-laced,\n\nAnd they spread the gold and jewel, grain and herb and fragrant ghee,  \nSapling twigs and bending branches, blossoms from the flowering tree,\n\nMilk-white garments gem-bespangled, and the _Chandan\'s_ fragrant dye,  \nWreaths and spices, snow-white lilies, lotus azure as the sky,\n\n_\n\nJatarupa_ and _Priyangu_ , honey, curd and holy oil,  \nCostly sandals gilt and jewelled, tiger-skin the hunter\'s spoil!\n\nDecked in gold and scented garlands, robed in radiance rich and rare,  \nSweetly stepped around Sugriva sixteen maidens passing fair,\n\nPriests received the royal bounty, gift and garment gold-belaced,  \nAnd they lit the holy altar with the sacred _mantra_ graced,\n\nAnd they poured the sweet libation on the altar\'s lighted flame,  \nAnd on throne of royal splendour placed the chief of royal fame!\n\nOn a high and open terrace with auspicious garlands graced,  \nFacing eastward, in his glory was the brave Sugriva placed,\n\nWater from each holy river, from each _tirtha_ famed of old,  \nFrom the broad and boundless ocean, was arranged in jars of gold,\n\nAnd from vase and horn of wild bull, on their monarch and their lord,  \nHoly consecrating water chiefs and loyal courtiers poured.\n\nGaya and the great Gavaksha, Gandha-madan proud and brave,  \nHanuman held up the vases, Jambaman his succour gave,\n\nAnd they laved the king Sugriva as Immortals in the sky  \nConsecrate the star-eyed INDRA in his mansions bright and high,\n\nAnd a shout of joy and triumph, like the pealing voice of war,  \nSpake Sugriva\'s consecration to the creatures near and far!\n\nDuteous still to Rama\'s mandate, as his first-born and his own,  \nKing Sugriva named young Angad sharer of his royal throne,\n\nGay and bannered town Kishkindha hailed Sugriva\'s gracious word,  \nTender Tara wiped her tear-drops bowing to a younger lord!\n\n## V\n\n## THE RAINS IN THE NILGIRI MOUNTAINS\n\n"Mark the shadowing rain and tempest," Rama to his brother said,  \nAs on Nalya\'s cloud-capped ranges in their hermit-guise they strayed,\n\nMassive clouds like rolling mountains gather thick and gather high,  \nLurid lightnings glint and sparkle, pealing thunders shake the sky,\n\nPregnant with the ocean moisture by the solar ray instilled,  \nNow the skies like fruitful mothers are with grateful waters filled!\n\nMark the folds of cloudy masses, ladder-like of smooth ascent,  \nOne could almost reach the Sun-god, wreath him with a wreath of scent,\n\nAnd when glow these heavy masses red and white with evening\'s glow,  \nOne could almost deem them sword-cuts branded by some heavenly fire!\n\nMark the streaks of golden lustre fighting up the checkered sky,  \nLike a lover _chandan_ -painted in each breeze it heaves a sigh,\n\nAnd the earth is hot and feverish, moistened with the tears of rain,  \nSighing like my anguished Sita when she wept in woe and pain!\n\nFresh and sweet like draught of nectar is the rain -besprinkled breeze,  \nFragrant with the _ketak_ blossom, scented by the camphor trees,\n\nFresh and bold each peak and mountain bathed in soft descending rain,  \nSo they sprinkle holy water when they bless a monarch\'s reign!\n\nFair and tall as holy hermits, stand yon shadow-mantled hills,  \nMurmuring _mantras_ with the zephyr, robed in threads of sparking rills,\n\nFair and young as gallant coursers neighing forth their thunder cries,  \nLashed by golden whips of lightning are the dappled sunlit skies!\n\nAh, my lost and loving Sita! writhing in a Raksha\'s power,  \nAs the lightning shakes and quivers in this dark tempestuous shower,\n\nShadows thicken on the prospect, flower and leaf are wet with rain,  \nAnd each passing object, Lakshman, wakes in me a thought of pain!\n\nJoyously from throne and empire with my Sita I could part,  \nAs the stream erodes its margin, Sita\'s absence breaks my heart,\n\nRain and tempest cloud the prospect as they cloud my onward path,  \nDubious is my darksome future, mighty is my foeman\'s wrath!\n\nRavan monarch of the Rakshas,-so Jataya said and died,--  \nIn some unknown forest fastness doth my sorrowing Sita bide,\n\nBut Sugriva true and faithful seeks the Raksha\'s secret hold,  \nFirm in faith and fixed in purpose we will face our foeman bold\n\n## VI\n\n## THE QUEST FOR SITA\n\nPast the rains, the marshalled Vanars gathered round Sugriva bold,  \nAnd unto a gallant chieftain thus the king his purpose told:\n\n"Brave in war and wise in counsel! take ten thousand of my best  \nSeek the hiding-place of Ravan in the regions of the East.\n\nSeek each ravine rock and forest and each shadowy hill and cave,  \nFar where bright Sarayu\'s waters mix with Ganga\'s ruddy wave,\n\nAnd where Jumna\'s dark blue waters ceaseless roll in regal pride,  \nAnd the Sone through leagues of country spreads its torrents far and wide.\n\nSeek where in Videha\'s empire castled towns and hamlets shine,  \nIn Kosala and in Malwa and by Kasi\'s sacred shrine,\n\nMagadh rich in peopled centres, Pundra region of the brave,  \nAnga rich in corn and cattle on the eastern ocean wave.\n\nSeek where clans of skilful weavers dwell upon the eastern shore,  \nAnd from virgin mines of silver miners work the sparkling ore.\n\nIn the realms of uncouth nations, in the islets of the sea,  \nIn the mountains of the ocean, wander far and wander free!"\n\nNext to Nila son of AGNI, Jambaman VIDHATA\'S son,  \nHanuman the son of MARUT, famed for deeds of valour done,\n\nUnto Gaya and Gavaksha, Gandha-madan true and tried,  \nUnto Angad prince and regent, thus the brave Sugriva cried:\n\n"Noblest, bravest of our chieftains, greatest of our race are ye,  \nSeek and search the Southern regions, rock and ravine, wood and tree,\n\nSearch the thousand peaks of Vindhya lifting high its misty head,  \nThrough the gorges of Narmada rolling o\'er its rocky bed,\n\nBy the gloomy Godavari and by Krishna\'s wooded stream,  \nThrough Utkala\'s sea-girt forests tinged by morning\'s early gleam.\n\nSearch the towns of famed Dasarna and Avanti\'s rocky shore,  \nAnd the uplands of Vidarbha and the mountains of Mysore,\n\nLand of Matsyas and Kalingas and Kausika\'s regions fair,  \nTrackless wilderness of Dandak seek with anxious toil and care.\n\nSearch the empire of the Andhras, of the sister-nations three,--  \nCholas, Cheras and the Pandyas dwelling by the southern sea,\n\nPass Kaveri\'s spreading waters, Malya\'s mountains towering brave,  \nSeek the isle of Tamra-parni, gemmed upon the ocean wave!"\n\nTo Susena chief and elder,--Tara\'s noble sire was he,--  \nSpake Sugriva with obeisance and in accents bold and free:\n\n"Take my lord, a countless army of the bravest and the best,  \nSearch where beats the sleepless ocean on the regions of the West.\n\nSearch the country of Saurashtras, of Bahlikas strong and brave,  \nAnd each busy mart and seaport on the western ocean wave,\n\nCastles girt by barren mountains, deserts by the sandy sea,  \nForests of the fragrant ketak, regions of the tamal tree!\n\nSearch the ocean port of Pattan shaded by its fruitful trees,  \nWhere the feathery groves of cocoa court the balmy western breeze,\n\nWhere on peaks of Soma-giri lordly lions wander free,  \nWhere the waters of the Indus mingle with the mighty sea!"\n\nLastly to the valiant chieftain Satavala strong and brave,  \nFor the quest of saintly Sita, thus his mighty mandate gave:\n\n"Hie thee, gallant Satavala, with thy forces wander forth,  \nTo the peaks of Himalaya, to the regions of the North!\n\nMlechchas and the wild Pulindas in the rocky regions dwell,  \nMadra chiefs and mighty Kurus live within each fertile vale,\n\nWild Kambojas of the mountains, Yavanas of wondrous skill,  \nSakas swooping from their gorges, Pattanas of iron will!\n\nSearch the woods of _devadaru_ mantling Himalaya\'s side,  \nAnd the forests of the _lodhra_ spreading in their darksome pride,\n\nSearch the land of Soma-srama where the gay Gandharvas dwell  \nIn the tableland of Kala search each rock and ravine well!\n\nCross the snowy Himalaya, and Sudarsan\'s holy peak,  \nDeva-sakha\'s wooded ranges which the feathered songsters seek,\n\nCross the vast and dreary region void of stream or wooded bill,  \nTill, you reach the white Kailasa, home of Gods, serene and still!\n\nPass Kuvera\'s pleasant regions, search the Krauncha mountain well,  \nAnd the land where warlike females and the horse-faced women dwell,\n\nHalt not till you reach the country where the Northern Kurus rest,  \nUtmost confines of the wide earth, home of Gods and Spirits blest!"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book VIII: Sita
