Of those also who do not perform sacrifices (the ascent to the moon) is\nstated by scripture.\n\nIt has been said that those who perform sacrifices, &c., go to the moon. The\nquestion now arises whether those also who do not perform sacrifices go to the\nmoon or not.--The purvapakshin maintains that it cannot be asserted that men\nbelonging to the former class only go to the moon,\n\np. 122\n\nbecause scripture speaks of the moon as being resorted to by those also who\nhave not performed sacrifices. For the Kaushitakins make the following general\nstatement, 'All who depart from this world go to the moon' (Kau. Up. I, 2).\nMoreover, the origination of a new body in the case of those who are born\nagain is not possible without their having (previously) reached the moon, on\naccount of the precise definition of number contained in the statement, 'In\nthe fifth oblation' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 9, 1) 1. Hence all men must be supposed to\nresort to the moon. If it be objected that it does not appear proper that\nthose who perform sacrifices and those who do not should go to the same place,\nwe reply that there is no real objection, because those who do not perform\nsacrifices do not enjoy anything in the moon.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[122:1](sbe38088.htm#fr_97) Which statement presupposes four other oblations,\nthe first of which is the one from which 'Soma the king rises.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 13](sbe38089.htm)\n\n"
