XIV.\n\nKrishn\xcc\x81a kills the demon Arisht\xcc\x81a, in the form of a bull.\n\nONE evening, whilst Krishn\xcc\x81a and the Gopis were amusing themselves in the\ndance, the demon Arisht\xcc\x81a, disguised as a savage bull, came to the spot, after\nhaving spread alarm through the station. His colour was that of a cloud\ncharged with rain; he had vast horns, and his eyes were like two fiery suns:\nas he moved, he ploughed up the ground with his hoofs: his tongue was\nrepeatedly licking his lips; his tail was erect; the sinews of his shoulders\nwere firm, and between them rose a hump of enormous dimensions; his haunches\nwere soiled with ordure, and he was a terror to the herds; his dewlap hung\nlow, and his face was marked with scars from butting against the trees.\nTerrifying all the kine, the demon who perpetually haunts the forests in the\nshape of a bull, destroying hermits and ascetics, advanced. Beholding an\nanimal of such a formidable aspect, the herdsmen and their women were\nexceedingly frightened, and called aloud on Krishn\xcc\x81a, who came to their\nsuccour, shouting and slapping his arm in defiance. When the Daitya heard the\nnoise, he turned upon his challenger, and fixing his eyes and pointing his\nhorns at the belly of Ke\xc5\x9bava, he ran furiously upon the youth. Krishn\xcc\x81a\nstirred not from his post, but, smiling in sport and derision, awaited the\nnear approach of the bull, when he seized him as an alligator would have done,\nand held him firmly by the horns, whilst he pressed his sides with his knees.\nHaving thus humbled his pride, and held him captive by his horns, he wrung his\nthroat, as if it had been a piece of wet cloth; and then tearing off one of\nthe horns, he beat the fierce demon with it until he died, vomiting blood from\nhis mouth. Seeing him slain, the herdsmen glorified Krishn\xcc\x81a, as the companies\nof the celestials of old praised Indra, when he triumphed over the Asura\nJambha 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[536:1](vp131.htm#fr_1496) This exploit is related a little more in detail in\nthe Bhagavata and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XV](vp132.htm)\n\n'
