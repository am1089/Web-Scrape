But some (consider the sin) a minor one, (and\n\np. 319\n\nhence claim) the existence (of expiation for the Naish _th_ ika also); as in\nthe case of the eating (of unlawful food). This has been explained (in the\nPurva Mima _m_ sa).\n\nSome teachers, however, are of opinion that the transgression of the vow of\nchastity, even on the part of a professed Brahma _k_ arin, is a minor sin, not\na mortal one, excepting cases where the wife of the teacher and so on are\nconcerned. For they plead that that sin is not anywhere enumerated among the\ndeadly ones such as violating a teacher's bed and so on. Accordingly they\nclaim the expiatory ceremony to be valid for the Naish _th_ ika as well as the\nUpakurva _n_ a; both being alike Brahma _k_ arins and having committed the\nsame offence. The case is analogous to that of eating. Just as Brahma _k_\narins (in general) who have broken their vow by eating honey, flesh, and the\nlike may again purify themselves by a ceremony, so here also.--The reason for\nthis decision is that for those who assume the absence of all expiation on the\npart of the Naish _th_ ikas no scriptural passage supporting their view is met\nwith; while those who admit expiation can base their view on the passage\nquoted above ('A student who has broken the vow' &c.), which makes no\ndistinction between Upakurva _n_ as and Naish _th_ ikas. It therefore is more\nappropriate to assume the validity of the ceremony for Naish _th_ ikas also.\nThe principle guiding the decision has been explained in the chapter treating\nof the means of right knowledge (Pu. Mi. Su. I, 3, 8).--On this view the Sm\n_ri_ ti-passage which declares that there is no expiation for the Naish _th_\nika must be explained as aiming at the origination of weighty effort on the\nNaish _th_ ika's part.--Similarly in the case of the mendicant and the hermit.\nThe hermit, when he has broken his vows, undergoes the K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra\npenance for twelve nights and then cultivates a place rich in plants. The\nmendicant proceeds like the hermit, with the exception of cultivating the\nSoma-plant, and undergoes the purifications prescribed for his state. The\nrules given by Sm _ri_ ti for those cases have to be followed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[318:1](sbe38250.htm#fr_202) Cp. e.g. \xc3\x82pastamba Dharma-sutra I, 9, 26, 8.
