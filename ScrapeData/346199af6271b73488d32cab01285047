It is ancient; and\nhas been highly cultivated. The nation of the Telugus was in former times very\npowerful, and its princes gave considerable encouragement to literature. The\nworks of its ancient poets are numerous and very voluminous. It possesses a\nvery scientific grammar, and a system of prosody nearly as highly polished as\nthat of the Greeks. In this and some other respects the language is\nacknowledged to be more difficult than Sanscrit.\n\nIt is peculiarly smooth and elegant in its sound, and the poets have\ncautiously preserved its euphony. Hence Europeans have called it the Italian\nof India. The student may at first think this remark, which is no new one,\nunfounded; as the pronunciation is strong and decided; and as the mixture of\nSanscrit terms often gives it a degree of roughness. But the pure rustic\ndialect as well as that of the poets is altogether different from this\ncolloquial language; in the pure dialect most of those Sanscrit words that had\nharsh sounds are softened till they are as smooth and melodious as pure\nTelugu.\n\nWith Sanscrit it is closely connected; as closely as English is with Latin.\nBut at the same time it is as truly original and nearly as copious as English.\nLike English it has borrowed its scientific terms from another tongue; and\nthese Sanscrit additions are daily increasing. Thus the language is becoming\nless pure.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, the incursions of the Mohamedans effectually\ncrushed the literature of Telangana; it has fallen low; and the colloquial\ndialect has become equally corrupt--men are now rarely met with among them who\ncan\n\np. ii\n\nread or explain the classical authors of the language; a knowledge of prosody\nis yet more rare.\n\nTwenty five years of peace in Telangana under the British government have now\nafforded opportunities for some revival of literature. The establishment of\nthe Honourable Company\'s College at Madras, and the encouragement there held\nout to good scholars in the language may have effected some revival; but much\nremains yet to be done. No poem or classical composition in Telugu has\nhitherto been [printed](errata.htm#0); and I believe no translation of a\nclassic into English has been [attempted](errata.htm#1).\n\nIt now remains to give some account of my author, VEMANA, whose writings are\npeculiarly useful to those who study the language, the style being simple, and\nthe variety of topics very extensive. These adages exemplify thousands of\nwords inadmissible into more dignified poetry. The thought and connection are\noften abstruse while the terms used are quite familiar.\n\nOf his history, little is known. He was not a Bramin but a _Capoo_ , or\nfarmer; a native of the Cuddapa district and born, I believe, in the\nneighbourhood of Gandicotta. He lived in the beginning of the eighteenth\ncentury. It is said that in verse 707 he has fixed the date of birth which is\nbelieved to have been his own. This date coincides with A. D. 1652. The date\nis given in the cycle of sixty years; but which cycle is intended is unknown.\nMany verses, however, prove satisfactorily that he wrote in the latter part of\nthe seventeenth century when the Mohamedans were [governors](errata.htm#2) of\nthat part of India. His family was powerful, but he renounced the world and\nbecame a _sanyasee_ or ascetic. He calls himself a _Yogee_.\n\nThese verses communicate hardly any idea of his history or connections, and\nlike all solitary ascetics ( _sanyasees_ or _yogee_ ) he has dropped his\nfamily name--calling himself simply Vema or Vemana at pleasure. This solitary\nlife has led him to address all the verses to himself, which, if this be not\nrecollected, certainly looks like the grossest egotism. This practice is far\nindeed from being peculiar to Vemana.\n\n[The name Vema and Vemana do not appear to be used by the Telugus of the\npresent day. Vema or Vemana in Sanscrit\n\np. iii\n\nsignify a loom. (see Wilson\'s Sanscrit Lexicon, page 854, and the Sabdartha\nCalpataru Vol. II, page 199). I believe these names to have been practical\ntitles alone, without a definite meaning. Thus it is well\n[known](errata.htm#3) that the titles or names of Dante and Hafiz were not the\noriginal names of those poets; the first of whom was named Durante or Durando\n(see preface to Cary\'s Dante) and the second Muhammed Shemsuddin].\n\nThese poems have attained very great popularity and parts are found translated\ninto Tamil and Malayalam or Canarese. Their terse [closeness](errata.htm#4) of\nexpression sometimes renders them difficult to translate with elegance; but\nsuch passages exemplify the manly force of a language that in the common\ndialect is often weak and verbose.\n\nOf his aphorisms many have become common proverbs. Parts of them are evidently\nclose translations from Sanscrit works, particularly the _Hitopadesa_ and\n_Bhagavat Gita_. In a few of these every word is pure Sanscrit.\n\nVemana was evidently, in philosophy, of the Vedanta school, a disciple of\nVyasa, whom Sir William Jones has (in the Asiatic Researches, Vol I, page 362)\nentitled the Plato of India. With the mystic tenets of Plato, those of Vemana\nclosely correspond while his moral doctrines as closely answer to those of\nDemocritus.\n\nThese verses are chiefly of three classes: moral, satirical and mystic In the\nmorals, many verses occur, breathing a spirit of devotion truly extraordinary\nin a Hindu. The satirical part is chiefly directed against the national\nreligion and customs particularly against Bramins. None of it is personal. The\nmystic portion is chiefly of use as exemplifying the powers of the language.\nThe reveries contained in this chapter are of a strangely abstruse nature and\nfurnish a remarkable instance of a powerful mind searching for the light of\ntruth which is lost in the darkness of heathen ignorance. The style of this\nand some other parts renders it easier to translate the verses into Latin than\ninto English. I have, however, left none in Latin (aliess) that\n[appeared](errata.htm#5) to deserve an [English](errata.htm#6) one. To the\nmore difficult verses I have subjoined a Telugu interpretation For some parts\nof this comment written in Telugu, I am indebted to two very\n\np. iv\n\nlearned Bramins who taught me the language, its grammar and prosody. They are\nTippabhotla Venkata Siva Sastri of Masulipatnam and Advyta Brahmia, the Pandit\nbelonging to the court in which I have the honour of being assistant judge.\n\nTo the mystic portion I have appended such notes as appeared requisite.\nFurther elucidations of the most ample nature will be found in the Bhagavat\nGita, with Dr. Wilkins\'s commentary and in Sir William Jones\'s essay on the\nMystical poetry. Poetry of the East appears in the third volume of the Asiatic\nResearches; It would be easy to refer to many other authors; but to save the\nreader trouble in an enquiry that can gratify nothing but curiosity, I have\nsubjoined a short explanation of the system.\n\nMost of the Verses in Vemana are written in a _ataveladi_ metre which consists\nof four lines; but the fourth line, with some exceptions, is a mere refrain or\nchorus in these words-- _Viswadabhirama Vinura Vema_.\n\nIt is perhaps impossible to meet with a complete copy of this poet in a\nmanuscript of any antiquity. The principal sources from which this edition is\ncompiled are nine. These were collected from Bellary, Cuddapa Madras,\nVijagpatnam, and the city in which I wrote. Few of these copies contain above\nfive hundred verses, none came up to seven hundred. The number, however, that\nI have succeeded in collecting is 2,100.\n\nOf the state of the manuscripts, it is not easy to give a correct idea. Errors\nof the grossest nature in orthography, metre and rhyme deface every line; and\nerroneous words are substituted to elicit a sense that the transcribers\nthought proper to prefer. Thus they have eluded many of the difficulties in\nthought or expression; and the corruption is indescribable in verse.\n\nVemana having written the _tadbhava_ word _guramu_ (for gruhamu) a house, the\ncopyists in defiance of metre and meaning have _gurramu_ , a horse.\n\nTo remedy such errors I prepared a general index to my manuscripts, showing\nthe place each verse occupies in each copy. For the verses in no two copies\nhad the same arrangement. By\n\np. v\n\nthis aid, the true reading has, I hope, seldom been lost. the correct metre I\ntrust never--the [most](errata.htm#7) frequent corruptions were substitutions\nof Sanscrit terms in defiance of measure, for pure Telugu expressions.\n\nTo the remarks on mystic philosophy, I have subjoined a short explanation of\nTelugu prosody. The statements are taken from the _Bheemana_ _Chandassu_ , but\nthe arrangement and mode of explanation are my own. Sir William Jones has\nremarked (As. Res 1-XVII on Panini) that "since grammar is only an instrument,\nand not the end of true knowledge, there can be little occasion to travel so\nrough and gloomy a path." To teach myself The science, I was obliged to reduce\nthe rules given by Bheemana in a very fantastic from to their real import; and\na mode then [occurred](errata.htm#8) to me through which by degrees I learnt\nthe whole with care. The original is so mysteriously complex that the failure\nof most aspirants even among Bramins to a knowledge of prosody is not\nsurprising.\n\nC. P.
