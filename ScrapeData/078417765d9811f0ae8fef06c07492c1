And a crane\nthought on seeing the fish:\n\n"I must outwit these fish somehow or other and make a prey of them."\n\nAnd he went and sat down at the edge of the water, thinking hew he should do\nit.\n\nWhen the fish saw him, they asked him, "What are you sitting there for, lost\nin thought?"\n\n"I am sitting thinking about you," said he.\n\n"Oh, sir what are you thinking about us?" said they.\n\n"Why," he replied, "there is very little water in this pond, and but little\nfor you to eat; and the heat is so great! So I was thinking, \'What in the\nworld will these fish do now?\' "\n\n"Yes, indeed, sir! what _are_ we to do?" said they.\n\n"If you will only do as I bid you, I will take you in my beak to a fine large\npond, covered with all the kinds of lotuses, and, put you into it," answered\nthe crane.\n\n"That a crane should take thought for the fishes is a thing unheard of, sir,\nsince the world began. It\'s eating us, one after the other, that you\'re aiming\nat."\n\n"Not I! So long as you trust me, I won\'t eat you. But if you don\'t believe me\nthat there is such a pond, send one of you with me to go and see it."\n\nThen they trusted him, and handed over to him one of their number--a big\nfellow, blind of one eye, whom they thought sharp enough in any emergency,\nafloat or ashore.\n\nHim the crane took with him, let him go in the pond, showed him the whole of\nit, brought him back, and let him go again close to the other fish. And he\ntold them all the glories of the pond.\n\nAnd when they heard what he said, they exclaimed, "All right, sir! You may\ntake us with you."\n\nThen the crane took the old purblind fish first to the bank of the other pond,\nand alighted in a Varana-tree growing on the bank there. But he threw it into\na fork of the tree, struck it with his beak, and killed it; and then ate its\nflesh, and threw its bones away at the foot of the tree. Then he went back and\ncalled out:\n\n"I\'ve thrown that fish in; let another one come."\n\nAnd in that manner he took all the fish, one by one, and ate them, till he\ncame back and found no more!\n\nBut there was still a crab left behind there; and the crane thought he would\neat him too, and called him out:\n\n"I say, good crab, I\'ve taken all, the fish away, and put them into a fine\nlarge pond. Come along. I\'ll take you too!"\n\n"But how will you take hold of me to carry me along?"\n\n"I\'ll bite hold of you with my beak."\n\n"You\'ll let me fall if you carry me like that. I won\'t go with you!"\n\n"Don\'t be afraid! I\'ll hold you quite tight all the way."\n\nThen said the crab to himself, "If this fellow once got hold of fish, he would\nnever let them go in a pond! Now if he should really put me into the pond, it\nwould be capital; but if he doesn\'t--then I\'ll cut his throat, and kill him!"\nSo he said to him:\n\n"Look here, friend, you won\'t be able to hold me tight enough; but we crabs\nhave a famous grip. If you let me catch hold of you round the neck with my\nclaws, I shall be glad to go with you."\n\nAnd the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him, and agreed. So the\ncrab caught hold of his neck with his claws as securely as with a pair of\nblacksmith\'s pincers and called out, "Off with you, now!"\n\nAnd the crane took him and showed him the pond, and then turned off towards\nthe Varana-tree.\n\n"Uncle! " cried the crab, "the pond lies that way, but you are taking me this\nway!"\n\n"Oh, that\'s it, is it?" answered the crane. "Your dear little uncle, your very\nsweet nephew, you call me! You mean me to understand, I suppose, that I am\nyour slave, who has to lift you up and carry you about with him! Now cast your\neye upon the heap of fish-bones lying at the root of yonder Varana-tree. Just\nas I have eaten those fish, every one of them, just so I will devour you as\nwell!"\n\n"Ah! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity," answered the crab;\n"but I\'m not going to let you eat _me._ On the contrary, it is _you_ that I am\ngoing to destroy. For you in your folly have not seen that I was outwitting\nyou. If we die we die both together; for I will cut off this head of yours,\nand cast it to the ground!" And so saying, he gave the crane\'s neck a grip\nwith his claws, as with a vice.\n\nThen gasping, and with tears trickling from his eyes, and trembling with the\nfear of death, the crane beseeched him, saying, "O my lord! Indeed I did not\nintend to eat you. Grant me my life!"\n\n"Well, well! step down into the pond, and put me in there."\n\nAnd he turned round and stepped down into the pond, and placed the crab on the\nmud at its edge. But the crab cut through its neck as clean as one would cut a\nlotus-stalk with a hunting-knife, and then only entered the water!\n\nWhen the Genius who lived in the Varana-tree saw this strange affair, he made\nthe wood resound with his plaudits, uttering in a pleasant voice the verse:\n\n"The villain, though exceeding clever,  \nShall prosper not by his villainy.  \nHe may win indeed, sharp-witted in deceit,  \nBut only as the Crane here from the Crab!"\n\n[![](tn/27.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/27.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Loving Laili](ift09.htm)\n\n'
