The practices which make for union with the Soul are: fervent\naspiration, spiritual reading, and complete obedience to the Master.\n\nThe word which I have rendered 'fervent aspiration' means primarily 'fire';\nand, in the Eastern teaching, it means the fire which gives life and light,\nand at the same time the fire which purifies. We have, therefore, as our first\npractice, as the first of the means of spiritual growth, that fiery quality of\nthe will which enkindles and illumines, and, at the same time, the steady\npractice of purification, the burning away of all known impurities. Spiritual\nreading is so universally accepted and understood, that it needs no comment.\nThe very study of Patanjali's Sutras is an exercise in spiritual reading, and\na very effective one. And so with all other books of the Soul. Obedience to\nthe Master means, that we shall make the will of the Master our will, and\nshall confirm in all wave to the will of the Divine, setting aside the wills\nof self, which are but psychic distortions of the one Divine Will. The\nconstant effort to obey in all the ways we know and understand, will reveal\nnew ways and new tasks, the evidence of new growth of the Soul. Nothing will\ndo more for the spiritual man in us than this, for there is no such\nregenerating power as the awakening spiritual will.\n\n### 2\\. Their aim is, to bring soul-vision, and to wear away hindrances.\n\nThe aim of fervour, spiritual reading and obedience to the Master, is, to\nbring soul-vision, and to wear away hindrances. Or, to use the phrase we have\nalready adopted, the aim of these practices is, to help the spiritual man to\nopen his eyes; to help him also to throw aside the veils and disguises, the\nenmeshing psychic nets which surround him, tying his hands, as it were, and\nbandaging his eyes. And this, as all teachers testify, is a long and arduous\ntask, a steady up-hill fight, demanding fine courage and persistent toil.\nFervour, the fire of the spiritual will, is, as we said, two-fold: it\nillumines, and so helps the spiritual man to see; and it also burns up the\nnets and meshes which ensnare the spiritual man. So with the other means,\nspiritual reading and obedience. Each, in its action, is two-fold, wearing\naway the psychical, and upbuilding the spiritual man.\n\n### 3\\. These are the hindrances: the darkness of unwisdom, self-assertion,\nlust hate, attachment.\n\nLet us try to translate this into terms of the psychical and spiritual man.\nThe darkness of unwisdom is, primarily, the self-absorption of the psychical\nman, his complete preoccupation with his own hopes and fears, plans and\npurposes, sensations and desires; so that he fails to see, or refuses to see,\nthat there is a spiritual man; and so doggedly resists all efforts of the\nspiritual man to cast off his psychic tyrant and set himself free. This is the\nreal darkness; and all those who deny the immortality of the soul, or deny the\nsoul's existence, and so lay out their lives wholly for the psychical, mortal\nman and his ambitions, are under this power of darkness. Born of this\ndarkness, this psychic self-absorption, is the dogged conviction that the\npsychic, personal man has separate, exclusive interests, which he can follow\nfor himself alone; and this conviction, when put into practice in our life,\nleads to contest with other personalities, and so to hate. This hate, again,\nmakes against the spiritual man, since it hinders the revelation of the high\nharmony between the spiritual man and his other selves, a harmony to be\nrevealed only through the practice of love, that perfect love which casts out\nfear.\n\nIn like manner, lust is the psychic man's craving for the stimulus of\nsensation, the din of which smothers the voice of the spiritual man, as, in\nShakespeare's phrase, the cackling geese would drown the song of the\nnightingale. And this craving for stimulus is the fruit of weakness, coming\nfrom the failure to find strength in the primal life of the spiritual man.\n\nAttachment is but another name for psychic self-absorption; for we are\nabsorbed, not in outward things, but rather in their images within our minds;\nour inner eyes are fixed on them; our inner desires brood over them; and so we\nblind ourselves to the presence of the prisoner, the enmeshed and fettered\nspiritual man.\n\n### 4\\. The darkness of unwisdom is the field of the others. These hindrances\nmay be dormant, or worn thin, or suspended, or expanded.\n\nHere we have really two Sutras in one. The first has been explained already:\nin the darkness of unwisdom grow the parasites, hate, lust, attachment. They\nare all outgrowths of the self-absorption of the psychical self.\n\nNext, we are told that these barriers may be either dormant, or suspended, or\nexpanded, or worn thin. Faults which are dormant will be brought out through\nthe pressure of life, or through the pressure of strong aspiration. Thus\nexpanded, they must be fought and conquered, or, as Patanjali quaintly says,\nthey must be worn thin,-as a veil might, or the links of manacles.\n\n### 5 The darkness of ignorance is: holding that which is unenduring, impure,\nfull of pain, not the Soul, to be eternal, pure, full of joy, the Soul.\n\nThis we have really considered already. The psychic man is unenduring, impure,\nfull of pain, not the Soul, not the real Self. The spiritual man is enduring,\npure, full of joy, the real Self. The darkness of unwisdom is, therefore, the\nself-absorption of the psychical, personal man, to the exclusion of the\nspiritual man. It is the belief, carried into action, that the personal man is\nthe real man, the man for whom we should toil, for whom we should build, for\nwhom we should live. This is that psychical man of whom it is said: he that\nsoweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption.\n\n### 6\\. Self-assertion comes from thinking of the Seer and the instrument of\nvision as forming one self.\n\nThis is the fundamental idea of the Sankhya philosophy, of which the Yoga is\navowedly the practical side. To translate this into our terms, we may say that\nthe Seer is the spiritual man; the instrument of vision is the psychical man,\nthrough which the spiritual man gains experience of the outer world. But we\nturn the servant into the master. We attribute to the psychical man, the\npersonal self, a reality which really belongs to the spiritual man alone; and\nso, thinking of the quality of the spiritual man as belonging to the\npsychical, we merge the spiritual man in the psychical; or, as the text says,\nwe think of the two as forming one self.\n\n### 7\\. Lust is the resting in the sense of enjoyment.\n\nThis has been explained again and again. Sensation, as, for example, the sense\nof taste, is meant to be the guide to action; in this case, the choice of\nwholesome food, and the avoidance of poisonous and hurtful things. But if we\nrest in the sense of taste, as a pleasure in itself; rest, that is, in the\npsychical side of taste, we fall into gluttony, and live to eat, instead of\neating to live. So with the other great organic power, the power of\nreproduction. This lust comes into being, through resting in the sensation,\nand looking for pleasure from that.\n\n### 8\\. Hate is the resting in the sense of pain.\n\nPain comes, for the most part, from the strife of personalities, the jarring\ndiscords between psychic selves, each of which deems itself supreme. A\ndwelling on this pain breeds hate, which tears the warring selves yet further\nasunder, and puts new enmity between them, thus hindering the harmony of the\nReal, the reconciliation through the Soul.\n\n### 9\\. Attachment is the desire toward life, even in the wise, carried\nforward by its own energy.\n\nThe life here desired is the psychic life, the intensely vibrating life of the\npsychical self. This prevails even in those who have attained much wisdom, so\nlong as it falls short of the wisdom of complete renunciation, complete\nobedience to each least behest of the spiritual man, and of the Master who\nguards and aids the spiritual man.\n\nThe desire of sensation, the desire of psychic life, reproduces itself,\ncarried on by its own energy and momentum; and hence comes the circle of death\nand rebirth, death and rebirth, instead of the liberation of the spiritual\nman.\n\n### 10\\. These hindrances, when they have become subtle, are to be removed by\na countercurrent\n\nThe darkness of unwisdom is to be removed by the light of wisdom, pursued\nthrough fervour, spiritual reading of holy teachings and of life itself, and\nby obedience to the Master.\n\nLust is to be removed by pure aspiration of spiritual life, which, bringing\ntrue strength and stability, takes away the void of weakness which we try to\nfill by the stimulus of sensations.\n\nHate is to be overcome by love. The fear that arises through the sense of\nseparate, warring selves is to be stilled by the realization of the One Self,\nthe one soul in all. This realization is the perfect love that casts out fear.\n\nThe hindrances are said to have become subtle when, by initial efforts, they\nhave been located and recognized in the psychic nature.\n\n### 11\\. Their active turnings are to be removed by meditation.\n\nHere is, in truth, the whole secret of Yoga, the science of the soul. The\nactive turnings, the strident vibrations, of selfishness, lust and hate are to\nbe stilled by meditation, by letting heart and mind dwell in spiritual life,\nby lifting up the heart to the strong, silent life above, which rests in the\nstillness of eternal love, and needs no harsh vibration to convince it of true\nbeing.\n\n### 12\\. The burden of bondage to sorrow has its root in these hindrances. It\nwill be felt in this life, or in a life not yet manifested.\n\nThe burden of bondage to sorrow has its root in the darkness of unwisdom, in\nselfishness, in lust, in hate, in attachment to sensation. All these are, in\nthe last analysis, absorption in the psychical self; and this means sorrow,\nbecause it means the sense of separateness, and this means jarring discord and\ninevitable death. But the psychical self will breed a new psychical self, in a\nnew birth, and so new sorrows in a life not yet manifest.\n\n### 13\\. From this root there grow and ripen the fruits of birth, of the life-\nspan, of all that is tasted in life.\n\nFully to comment on this, would be to write a treatise on Karma and its\npractical working in detail, whereby the place and time of the next birth, its\ncontent and duration. are determined; and to do this the present commentator\nis in no wise fitted. But this much is clearly understood: that, through a\nkind of spiritual gravitation, the incarnating self is drawn to a home and\nlife-circle which will give it scope and discipline; and its need of\ndiscipline is clearly conditioned by its character, its standing, its\naccomplishment.\n\n### 14\\. These bear fruits of rejoicing, or of affliction, as they are sprung\nfrom holy or unholy works.\n\nSince holiness is obedience to divine law, to the law of divine harmony, and\nobedience to harmony strengthens that harmony in the soul, which is the one\ntrue joy, therefore joy comes of holiness: comes, indeed, in no other way. And\nas unholiness is disobedience, and therefore discord, therefore unholiness\nmakes for pain; and this two-fold law is true, whether the cause take effect\nin this, or in a yet unmanifested birth.\n\n### 15\\. To him who possesses discernment, all personal life is misery,\nbecause it ever waxes and wanes, is ever afflicted with restlessness, makes\never new dynamic impresses in the mind; and because all its activities war\nwith each other.\n\nThe whole life of the psychic self is misery, because it ever waxes and wanes;\nbecause birth brings inevitable death; because there is no expectation without\nits shadow, fear. The life of the psychic self is misery, because it is\nafflicted with restlessness; so that he who has much, finds not satisfaction,\nbut rather the whetted hunger for more. The fire is not quenched by pouring\noil on it; so desire is not quenched by the satisfaction of desire. Again, the\nlife of the psychic self is misery, because it makes ever new dynamic\nimpresses in the mind; because a desire satisfied is but the seed from which\nsprings the desire to find like satisfaction again. The appetite comes in\neating, as the proverb says, and grows by what it feeds on. And the psychic\nself, torn with conflicting desires, is ever the house divided against itself,\nwhich must surely fall.\n\n### 16\\. This pain is to be warded off, before it has come.\n\nIn other words, we cannot cure the pains of life by laying on them any balm.\nWe must cut the root, absorption in the psychical self. So it is said, there\nis no cure for the misery of longing, but to fix the heart upon the eternal.\n\n### 17\\. The cause of what is to be warded off, is the absorption of the Seer\nin things seen.\n\nHere again we have the fundamental idea of the Sankhya, which is the\nintellectual counterpart of the Yoga system. The cause of what is to be warded\noff, the root of misery, is the absorption of consciousness in the psychical\nman and the things which beguile the psychical man. The cure is liberation.\n\n### 18\\. Things seen have as their property manifestation, action, inertia.\nThey form the basis of the elements and the sense-powers. They make for\nexperience and for liberation.\n\nHere is a whole philosophy of life. Things seen, the total of the phenomenal,\npossess as their property, manifestation, action, inertia: the qualities of\nforce and matter in combination. These, in their grosser form, make the\nmaterial world; in their finer, more subjective form, they make the psychical\nworld, the world of sense-impressions and mind-images. And through this\ntotality of the phenomenal, the soul gains experience, and is prepared for\nliberation. In other words, the whole outer world exists for the purposes of\nthe soul, and finds in this its true reason for being.\n\n### 19\\. The grades or layers of the Three Potencies are the defined, the\nundefined, that with distinctive mark, that without distinctive mark.\n\nOr, as we might say, there are two strata of the physical, and two strata of\nthe psychical realms. In each, there is the side of form, and the side of\nforce. The form side of the physical is here called the defined. The force\nside of the physical is the undefined, that which has no boundaries. So in the\npsychical; there is the form side; that with distinctive marks, such as the\ncharacteristic features of mind-images; and there is the force side, without\ndistinctive marks, such as the forces of desire or fear, which may flow now to\nthis mind-image, now to that.\n\n### 20\\. The Seer is pure vision. Though pure, he looks out through the\nvesture of the mind.\n\nThe Seer, as always, is the spiritual man whose deepest consciousness is pure\nvision, the pure life of the eternal. But the spiritual man, as yet unseeing\nin his proper person, looks out on the world through the eyes of the psychical\nman, by whom he is enfolded and enmeshed. The task is, to set this prisoner\nfree, to clear the dust of ages from this buried temple.\n\n### 21\\. The very essence of things seen is, that they exist for the Seer.\n\nThe things of outer life, not only material things, but the psychic man also,\nexist in very deed for the purposes of the Seer, the Soul, the spiritual man\nDisaster comes, when the psychical man sets up, so to speak, on his own\naccount, trying to live for himself alone, and taking material things to\nsolace his loneliness.\n\n### 22\\. Though fallen away from him who has reached the goal, things seen\nhave not altogether fallen away, since they still exist for others.\n\nWhen one of us conquers hate, hate does not thereby cease out of the world,\nsince others still hate and suffer hatred. So with other delusions, which hold\nus in bondage to material things, and through which we look at all material\nthings. When the coloured veil of illusion is gone, the world which we saw\nthrough it is also gone, for now we see life as it is, in the white radiance\nof eternity. But for others the coloured veil remains, and therefore the world\nthus coloured by it remains for them, and will remain till they, too, conquer\ndelusion.\n\n### 23\\. The association of the Seer with things seen is the cause of the\nrealizing of the nature of things seen, and also of the realizing of the\nnature of the Seer.\n\nLife is educative. All life's infinite variety is for discipline, for the\ndevelopment of the soul. So passing through many lives, the Soul learns the\nsecrets of the world, the august laws that are written in the form of the\nsnow-crystal or the majestic order of the stars. Yet all these laws are but\nreflections, but projections outward, of the laws of the soul; therefore in\nlearning these, the soul learns to know itself. All life is but the mirror\nwherein the Soul learns to know its own face.\n\n### 24\\. The cause of this association is the darkness of unwisdom.\n\nThe darkness of unwisdom is the absorption of consciousness in the personal\nlife, and in the things seen by the personal life. This is the fall, through\nwhich comes experience, the learning of the lessons of life. When they are\nlearned, the day of redemption is at hand.\n\n### 25\\. The bringing of this association to an end, by bringing the darkness\nof unwisdom to an end, is the great liberation; this is the Seer's attainment\nof his own pure being.\n\nWhen the spiritual man has, through the psychical, learned all life's lessons,\nthe time has come for him to put off the veil and disguise of the psychical\nand to stand revealed a King, in the house of the Father. So shall he enter\ninto his kingdom, and go no more out.\n\n### 26\\. A discerning which is carried on without wavering is the means of\nliberation.\n\nHere we come close to the pure Vedanta, with its discernment between the\neternal and the temporal. St. Paul, following after Philo and Plato, lays down\nthe same fundamental principle: the things seen are temporal, the things\nunseen are eternal.\n\nPatanjali means something more than an intellectual assent, though this too is\nvital. He has in view a constant discriminating in act as well as thought; of\nthe two ways which present themselves for every deed or choice, always to\nchoose the higher way, that which makes for the things eternal: honesty rather\nthan roguery, courage and not cowardice, the things of another rather than\none's own, sacrifice and not indulgence. This true discernment, carried out\nconstantly, makes for liberation.\n\n### 27\\. His illuminations is sevenfold, rising in successive stages.\n\nPatanjali's text does not tell us what the seven stages of this illumination\nare. The commentator thus describes them;\n\nFirst, the danger to be escaped is recognized; it need not be recognized a\nsecond time. Second, the causes of the danger to be escaped are worn away;\nthey need not be worn away a second time. Third, the way of escape is clearly\nperceived, by the contemplation which checks psychic perturbation. Fourth, the\nmeans of escape, clear discernment, has been developed. This is the fourfold\nrelease belonging to insight. The final release from the psychic is three-\nfold: As fifth of the seven degrees, the dominance of its thinking is ended;\nas sixth, its potencies, like rocks from a precipice, fall of themselves; once\ndissolved, they do not grow again. Then, as seventh, freed from these\npotencies, the spiritual man stands forth in his own nature as purity and\nlight. Happy is the spiritual man who beholds this seven-fold illumination in\nits ascending stages.\n\n### 28\\. From steadfastly following after the means of Yoga, until impurity is\nworn away, there comes the illumination of thought up to full discernment.\n\nHere, we enter on the more detailed practical teaching of Patanjali, with its\nsound and luminous good sense. And when we come to detail the means of Yoga,\nwe may well be astonished at their simplicity. There is little in them that is\nmysterious. They are very familiar. The essence of the matter lies in carrying\nthem out.\n\n### 29\\. The eight means of Yoga are: the Commandments, the Rules, right\nPoise, right Control of the life-force, Withdrawal, Attention, Meditation,\nContemplation.\n\nThese eight means are to be followed in their order, in the sense which will\nimmediately be made clear. We can get a ready understanding of the first two\nby comparing them with the Commandments which must be obeyed by all good\ncitizens, and the Rules which are laid on the members of religious orders.\nUntil one has fulfilled the first, it is futile to concern oneself with the\nsecond. And so with all the means of Yoga. They must be taken in their order.\n\n### 30\\. The Commandments are these: nom injury, truthfulness, abstaining from\nstealing, from impurity, from covetousness.\n\nThese five precepts are almost exactly the same as the Buddhist Commandments:\nnot to kill, not to steal, not to be guilty of incontinence, not to drink\nintoxicants, to speak the truth. Almost identical is St. Paul's list: Thou\nshalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou\nshalt not covet. And in the same spirit is the answer made to the young map\nhaving great possessions, who asked, What shall I do to be saved? and received\nthe reply: Keep the Commandments.\n\nThis broad, general training, which forms and develops human character, must\nbe accomplished to a very considerable degree, before there can be much hope\nof success in the further stages of spiritual life. First the psychical, and\nthen the spiritual. First the man, then the angel. On this broad, humane and\nwise foundation does the system of Patanjali rest.\n\n### 31\\. The Commandments, not limited to any race, place, time or occasion,\nuniversal, are the great obligation.\n\nThe Commandments form the broad general training of humanity. Each one of them\nrests on a universal, spiritual law. Each one of them expresses an attribute\nor aspect of the Self, the Eternal; when we violate one of the Commandments,\nwe set ourselves against the law and being of the Eternal, thereby bringing\nourselves to inevitable con fusion. So the first steps in spiritual life must\nbe taken by bringing ourselves into voluntary obedience to these spiritual\nlaws and thus making ourselves partakers of the spiritual powers, the being of\nthe Eternal Like the law of gravity, the need of air to breathe, these great\nlaws know no exceptions They are in force in all lands, throughout al times,\nfor all mankind.\n\n### 32\\. The Rules are these: purity, serenity fervent aspiration, spiritual\nreading, and per feet obedience to the Master.\n\nHere we have a finer law, one which humanity as a whole is less ready for,\nless fit to obey. Yet we can see that these Rules are the same in essence as\nthe Commandments, but on a higher, more spiritual plane. The Commandments may\nbe obeyed in outer acts and abstinences; the Rules demand obedience of the\nheart and spirit, a far more awakened and more positive consciousness. The\nRules are the spiritual counterpart of the Commandments, and they have finer\ndegrees, for more advanced spiritual growth.\n\n### 33\\. When transgressions hinder, the weight of the imagination should be\nthrown on the opposite side.\n\nLet us take a simple case, that of a thief, a habitual criminal, who has\ndrifted into stealing in childhood, before the moral consciousness has\nawakened. We may imprison such a thief, and deprive him of all possibility of\nfurther theft, or of using the divine gift of will. Or we may recognize his\ndisadvantages, and help him gradually to build up possessions which express\nhis will, and draw forth his self-respect. If we imagine that, after he has\nbuilt well, and his possessions have become dear to him, he himself is robbed,\nthen we can see how he would come vividly to realize the essence of theft and\nof honesty, and would cleave to honest dealings with firm conviction. In some\nsuch way does the great Law teach us. Our sorrows and losses teach us the pain\nof the sorrow and loss we inflict on others, and so we cease to inflict them.\n\nNow as to the more direct application. To conquer a sin. let heart and mind\nrest, not on the sin, but on the contrary virtue. Let the sin be forced out by\npositive growth in the true direction, not by direct opposition. Turn away\nfrom the sin and go forward courageously, constructively, creatively, in well-\ndoing. In this way the whole nature will gradually be drawn up to the higher\nlevel, on which the sin does not even exist. The conquest of a sin is a matter\nof growth and evolution, rather than of opposition.\n\n### 34\\. Transgressions are injury, falsehood, theft, incontinence, envy;\nwhether committed, or caused, or assented to, through greed, wrath, or\ninfatuation; whether faint, or middling, or excessive; bearing endless, fruit\nof ignorance and pain. Therefore must the weight be cast on the other side.\n\nHere are the causes of sin: greed, wrath, infatuation, with their effects,\nignorance and pain. The causes are to be cured by better wisdom, by a truer\nunderstanding of the Self, of Life. For greed cannot endure before the\nrealization that the whole world belongs to the Self, which Self we are; nor\ncan we hold wrath against one who is one with the Self, and therefore with\nourselves; nor can infatuation, which is the seeking for the happiness of the\nAll in some limited part of it, survive the knowledge that we are heirs of the\nAll. Therefore let thought and imagination, mind and heart, throw their weight\non the other side; the side, not of the world,.but of the Self.\n\n### 35\\. Where non-injury is perfected, all enmity ceases in the presence of\nhim who possesses it.\n\nWe come now to the spiritual powers which result from keeping the\nCommandments; from the obedience to spiritual law which is the keeping of the\nCommandments. Where the heart is full of kindness which seeks no injury to\nanother, either in act or thought or wish, this full love creates an\natmosphere of harmony, whose benign power touches with healing all who come\nwithin its influence. Peace in the heart radiates peace to other hearts, even\nmore surely than contention breeds contention.\n\n### 36\\. When he is perfected in truth, all acts and their fruits depend on\nhim.\n\nThe commentator thus explains: If he who has attained should say to a man,\nBecome righteous! the man becomes righteous. If he should say, Gain heaven!\nthe man gains heaven. His word is not in vain.\n\nExactly the same doctrine was taught by the Master who said to his disciples:\nReceive ye the Holy Ghost: whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto\nthem; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.\n\n### 37\\. Where cessation from theft is perfected, all treasures present\nthemselves to him who possesses it.\n\nHere is a sentence which may warn us that, beside the outer and apparent\nmeaning, there is in many of these sentences a second and finer significance.\nThe obvious meaning is, that he who has wholly ceased from theft, in act,\nthought and wish, finds buried treasures in his path, treasures of jewels and\ngold and pearls. The deeper truth is, that he who in every least thing is\nwholly honest with the spirit of Life, finds Life supporting him in all\nthings, and gains admittance to the treasure house of Life, the spiritual\nuniverse.\n\n### 38\\. For him who is perfect in continence, the reward is valour and\nvirility.\n\nThe creative power, strong and full of vigour, is no longer dissipated, but\nturned to spiritual uses. It upholds and endows the spiritual man, conferring\non him the creative will, the power to engender spiritual children instead of\nbodily progeny. An epoch of life, that of man the animal, has come to an end;\na new epoch, that of the spiritual man, is opened. The old creative power is\nsuperseded and transcended; a new creative power, that of the spiritual man,\ntakes its place, carrying with it the power to work creatively in others for\nrighteousness and eternal life.\n\nOne of the commentaries says that he who has attained is able to transfer to\nthe minds of his disciples what he knows concerning divine union, and the\nmeans of gaining it. This is one of the powers of purity.\n\n### 39\\. Where there is firm conquest of covetousness, he who has conquered it\nawakes to the how and why of life.\n\nSo it is said that, before we can understand the laws of Karma, we must free\nourselves from Karma. The conquest of covetousness brings this rich fruit,\nbecause the root of covetousness is the desire of the individual soul, the\nwill toward manifested life. And where the desire of the individual soul is\novercome by the superb, still life of the universal Soul welling up in the\nheart within, the great secret is discerned, the secret that the individual\nsoul is not an isolated reality, but the ray, the manifest instrument of the\nLife, which turns it this way and that until the great work is accomplished,\nthe age-long lesson learned. Thus is the how and why of life disclosed by\nceasing from covetousness. The Commentator says that this includes a knowledge\nof one's former births.\n\n### 40\\. Through purity a withdrawal from one's own bodily life, a ceasing\nfrom infatuation with the bodily life of others.\n\nAs the spiritual light grows in the heart within, as the taste for pure Life\ngrows stronger, the consciousness opens toward the great, secret places\nwithin, where all life is one, where all lives are one. Thereafter, this\nouter, manifested, fugitive life, whether of ourselves or of others, loses\nsomething of its charm and glamour, and we seek rather the deep infinitudes.\nInstead of the outer form and surroundings of our lives, we long for their\ninner and everlasting essence. We desire not so much outer converse and\ncloseness to our friends, but rather that quiet communion with them in the\ninner chamber of the soul, where spirit speaks to spirit, and spirit answers;\nwhere alienation and separation never enter; where sickness and sorrow and\ndeath cannot come.\n\n### 41\\. To the pure of heart come also a quiet spirit, one-pointed thought,\nthe victory over sensuality, and fitness to behold the Soul.\n\nBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God, who is the supreme\nSoul; the ultimate Self of all beings. In the deepest sense, purity means\nfitness for this vision, and also a heart cleansed from all disquiet, from all\nwandering and unbridled thought, from the torment of sensuous imaginings; and\nwhen the spirit is thus cleansed and pure, it becomes at one in essence with\nits source, the great Spirit, the primal Life. One consciousness now thrills\nthrough both, for the psychic partition wall is broken down. Then shall the\npure in heart see God, because they become God.\n\n### 42\\. From acceptance, the disciple gains happiness supreme.\n\nOne of the wise has said: accept conditions, accept others, accept yourself.\nThis is the true acceptance, for all these things are what they are through\nthe will of the higher Self, except their deficiencies, which come through\nthwarting the will of the higher Self, and can be conquered only through\ncompliance with that will. By the true acceptance, the disciple comes into\noneness of spirit with the overruling Soul; and, since the own nature of the\nSoul is being, happiness, bliss, he comes thereby into happiness supreme.\n\n### 43\\. The perfection of the powers of the bodily vesture comes through the\nwearing away of impurities, and through fervent aspiration.\n\nThis is true of the physical powers, and of those which dwell in the higher\nvestures. There must be, first, purity; as the blood must be pure, before one\ncan attain to physical health. But absence of impurity is not in itself\nenough, else would many nerveless ascetics of the cloisters rank as high\nsaints. There is needed, further, a positive fire of the will; a keen vital\nvigour for the physical powers, and something finer, purer, stronger, but of\nkindred essence, for the higher powers. The fire of genius is something more\nthan a phrase, for there can be no genius without the celestial fire of the\nawakened spiritual will.\n\n### 44\\. Through spiritual reading, the disciple gains communion with the\ndivine Power on which his heart is set.\n\nSpiritual reading meant, for ancient India, something more than it does with\nus. It meant, first, the recital of sacred texts, which, in their very sounds,\nhad mystical potencies; and it meant a recital of texts which were divinely\nemanated, and held in themselves the living, potent essence of the divine.\n\nFor us, spiritual reading means a communing with the recorded teachings of the\nMasters of wisdom, whereby we read ourselves into the Master's mind, just as\nthrough his music one can enter into the mind and soul of the master musician.\nIt has been well said that all true art is contagion of feeling; so that\nthrough the true reading of true books we do indeed read ourselves into the\nspirit of the Masters, share in the atmosphere of their wisdom and power, and\ncome at last into their very presence.\n\n### 45\\. Soul-vision is perfected through perfect obedience to the Master.\n\nThe sorrow and darkness of life come of the erring personal will which sets\nitself against the will of the Soul, the one great Life. The error of the\npersonal will is inevitable, since each will must be free to choose, to try\nand fail, and so to find the path. And sorrow and darkness are inevitable,\nuntil the path be found, and the personal will made once more one with the\ngreater Will, wherein it finds rest and power, without losing freedom. In His\nwill is our peace. And with that peace comes light. Soul-vision is perfected\nthrough obedience.\n\n### 46\\. Right poise must be firm and without strain.\n\nHere we approach a section of the teaching which has manifestly a two-fold\nmeaning. The first is physical, and concerns the bodily position of the\nstudent, and the regulation of breathing. These things have their direct\ninfluence upon soul-life, the life of the spiritual man, since it is always\nand everywhere true that our study demands a sound mind in a sound body. The\npresent sentence declares that, for work and for meditation, the position of\nthe body must be steady and without strain, in order that the finer currents\nof life may run their course.\n\nIt applies further to the poise of the soul, that fine balance and stability\nwhich nothing can shake, where the consciousness rests on the firm foundation\nof spiritual being. This is indeed the house set upon a rock, which the winds\nand waves beat upon in vain.\n\n### 47\\. Right poise is to be gained by steady and temperate effort, and by\nsetting the heart upon the everlasting.\n\nHere again, there is the two-fold meaning, for physical poise is to be gained\nby steady effort of the muscles, by gradual and wise training, linked with a\nright understanding of, and relation with, the universal force of gravity.\nUprightness of body demands that both these conditions shall be fulfilled.\n\nIn like manner the firm and upright poise of the spiritual man is to be gained\nby steady and continued effort, always guided by wisdom, and by setting the\nheart on the Eternal, filling the soul with the atmosphere of the spiritual\nworld. Neither is effective without the other. Aspiration without effort\nbrings weakness; effort without aspiration brings a false strength, not\nresting on enduring things. The two together make for the right poise which\nsets the spiritual man firmly and steadfastly on his feet.\n\n### 48 The fruit of right poise is the strength to resist the shocks of\ninfatuation or sorrow.\n\nIn the simpler physical sense, which is also coveted by the wording of the\noriginal, this sentence means that wise effort establishes such bodily poise\nthat the accidents of life cannot disturb it, as the captain remains steady,\nthough disaster overtake his ship.\n\nBut the deeper sense is far more important. The spiritual man, too, must learn\nto withstand all shocks, to remain steadfast through the perturbations of\nexternal things and the storms and whirlwinds of the psychical world. This is\nthe power which is gained by wise, continuous effort, and by filling the\nspirit with the atmosphere of the Eternal.\n\n### 49\\. When this is gained, there follows the right guidance of the life-\ncurrents, the control of the incoming and outgoing breath.\n\nIt is well understood to-day that most of our maladies come from impure\nconditions of the blood. It is coming to be understood that right breathing,\nright oxygenation, will do very much to keep the blood clean and pure.\nTherefore a right knowledge of breathing is a part of the science of life.\n\nBut the deeper meaning is, that the spiritual man, when he has gained poise\nthrough right effort and aspiration, can stand firm, and guide the currents of\nhis life, both the incoming current of events, and the outgoing current of his\nacts.\n\nExactly the same symbolism is used in the saying: Not that which goeth into\nthe mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this\ndefileth a man. . . . Those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth\nfrom the heart . . . out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders,\nuncleanness, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. Therefore the first step in\npurification is to keep the Commandments.\n\n### 50\\. The life-current is either outward, or inward, or balanced; it is\nregulated according to place, time, number; it is prolonged and subtle.\n\nThe technical, physical side of this has its value. In the breath, there\nshould be right inbreathing, followed by the period of pause, when the air\ncomes into contact with the blood, and this again followed by right\noutbreathing, even, steady, silent. Further, the lungs should be evenly\nfilled; many maladies may arise from the neglect and consequent weakening of\nsome region of the lungs. And the number of breaths is so important, so\nclosely related to health, that every nurse's chart records it.\n\nBut the deeper meaning is concerned with the currents of life; with that which\ngoeth into and cometh out of the heart.\n\n### 51\\. The fourth degree transcends external and internal objects.\n\nThe inner meaning seems to be that, in addition to the three degrees of\ncontrol already described, control, that is, over the incoming current of\nlife, over the outgoing current, and over the condition of pause or\nquiescence, there is a fourth degree of control, which holds in complete\nmastery both the outer passage of events and the inner currents of thoughts\nand emotions; a condition of perfect poise and stability in the midst of the\nflux of things outward and inward.\n\n### 52\\. Thereby is worn away the veil which covers up the light.\n\nThe veil is the psychic nature, the web of emotions, desires, argumentative\ntrains of thought, which cover up and obscure the truth by absorbing the\nentire attention and keeping the consciousness in the psychic realm. When\nhopes and fears are reckoned at their true worth, in comparison with lasting\npossessions of the Soul; when the outer reflections of things have ceased to\ndistract us from inner realities; when argumentative thought no longer\nentangles us, but yields its place to flashing intuition, the certainty which\nsprings from within; then is the veil worn away, the consciousness is drawn\nfrom the psychical to the spiritual, from the temporal to the Eternal. Then is\nthe light unveiled.\n\n### 53\\. Thence comes the mind's power to hold itself in the light.\n\nIt has been well said, that what we most need is the faculty of spiritual\nattention; and in the same direction of thought it has been eloquently\ndeclared that prayer does not consist in our catching God's attention, but\nrather in our allowing God to hold our attention.\n\nThe vital matter is, that we need to disentangle our consciousness from the\nnoisy and perturbed thraldom of the psychical, and to come to consciousness as\nthe spiritual man. This we must do, first, by purification, through the\nCommandments and the Rules; and, second, through the faculty of spiritual\nattention, by steadily heeding endless fine intimations of the spiritual power\nwithin us, and by intending our consciousness thereto; thus by degrees\ntransferring the centre of consciousness from the psychical to the spiritual.\nIt is a question, first, of love, and then of attention.\n\n### 54\\. The right Withdrawal is the disengaging of the powers from\nentanglement in outer things, as the psychic nature has been withdrawn and\nstilled.\n\nTo understand this, let us reverse the process, and think of the one\nconsciousness, centred in the Soul, gradually expanding and taking on the form\nof the different perceptive powers; the one will, at the same time,\ndifferentiating itself into the varied powers of action.\n\nNow let us imagine this to be reversed, so that the spiritual force, which has\ngone into the differentiated powers, is once more gathered together into the\ninner power of intuition and spiritual will, taking on that unity which is the\nhallmark of spiritual things, as diversity is the seal of material things.\n\nIt is all a matter of love for the quality of spiritual consciousness, as\nagainst psychical consciousness, of love and attention. For where the heart\nis, there will the treasure be also; where the consciousness is, there will\nthe vesture with its powers be developed.\n\n### 55\\. Thereupon follows perfect mastery over the powers.\n\nWhen the spiritual condition which we have described is reached, with its\npurity, poise, and illuminated vision, the spiritual man is coming into his\ninheritance, and gaining complete mastery of his powers.\n\nIndeed, much of the struggle to keep the Commandments and the Rules has been\npaving the way for this mastery; through this very struggle and sacrifice the\nmastery has become possible; just as, to use St. Paul's simile, the athlete\ngains the mastery in the contest and the race through the sacrifice of his\nlong and arduous training. Thus he gains the crown.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Introduction to Book III](ysp05.htm)\n\n"
