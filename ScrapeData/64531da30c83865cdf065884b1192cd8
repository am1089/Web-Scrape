Now we will explain the oblations (offered) to the vital air (pra _n_ a)\nby _S_ alinas (householders) and Yayavaras (vagrants), who sacrifice to the\nsoul. 1\n\n2\\. At the end of all the necessary (daily rites), let him sit down, facing\nthe east, in a place that has been well cleaned and smeared with cowdung; next\nlet him worship that prepared (food) which is being brought. (saying), 'Bhu\n_h_ , Bhuva _h_ , Sva _h_ , Om,' (and then) remain silent.\n\n3\\. (Next) he pours water round the food which has been placed (before him),\nturning his right hand towards it, and reciting the Mahavyah _ri_ tis;\n(afterwards), continuing to hold (the dish) with his left hand, he first\ndrinks water, (saying), 'Thou art a substratum for ambrosia,' and (finally)\noffers five oblations of food to the vital airs, (reciting the 3\n\np. 263\n\ntexts), 'Full of reverence, I offer ambrosia to Pra _n_ a; mayest thou\npropitiously enter me, not in order to burn me. To Pra _n_ a, Svaha!' &c.\n\n4\\. After offering the five oblations of food to the vital airs, let him\nfinish his meal silently. Meditating in his heart on the lord of created\nbeings, let him not emit speech while (eating),\n\n5\\. If he emits speech, he shall mutter 'Bhu _h_ , Bhuva _h_ , Sva _h_ , Om,'\nand afterwards continue to eat.\n\n6\\. Now they quote also (the following rule): 'If he sees (bits of) skin,\nhair, nail-(parings), insects, or the dung of rats (in his food), 'he shall\ntake out a lump, sprinkle that spot with water, scatter ashes on it, again\nsprinkle it with water, and use (the remainder of the food), after it has been\ndeclared fit (for use).' 6\n\n7\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He shall eat, seated with his\nface towards the east, silent, not despising his food, not scattering\n(fragments on the ground), and solely attend (to his dinner); and, after he\nhas eaten, he shall touch fire.' 7\n\n8\\. He shall not cut off with his teeth (pieces from) eatables (that must be\nswallowed) entire, (such as) cakes, bulbs, roots, fruit, and flesh.\n\n9\\. (Let him) not (eat) to repletion. 9\n\n10\\. After (dinner) he shall drink water, (reciting the text), 'Thou art 'a\ncovering for ambrosia,' and stroke (the region of) the heart, (saying), 'Thou\nart the bond that connects the vital airs; (thou art) 10\n\np. 264\n\n[paragraph continues] Rudra and Death; enter me; mayest thou grow through this\nfood.'\n\n11\\. After sipping water a second time, he allows (the drops from) the hand to\nflow on the big toe of his right foot (and recites the following text): 'May\nthe male be pleased, he who is of the size of a thumb, who occupies (a space\nof the size of) a thumb, who is the lord of the whole world, masterful, and\nthe enjoyer of the universe.' 11\n\n12\\. Let him perform the subsequent consecration (anumantra _n_ a) of the\n(food which has been) offered, with raised arms, (and let him recite) the five\n(texts beginning), 'With faith, worshipping Pra _n_ a, (I have) offered\nambrosia; mayest thou increase Pra _n_ a through this food,' 12\n\n13\\. (And let him address the soul with the last text of the Anuvaka), '(May)\nmy soul (gain) immortality in the universal soul.'\n\n14\\. And let him (meditate on his) soul (as) united with the imperishable\n(syllable Om). 14\n\n15\\. He who sacrifices to the soul, surpasses him who offers all sacrifices.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[262:1](sbe1466.htm#fr_1259) **12**.
