After the father\'s death let the sons divide his estate, 1\n\np. 303\n\n2\\. Or, during his lifetime, when the mother is past child-bearing, if he\ndesires it, 2\n\n3\\. Or the whole (estate may go) to the first-born; (and) he shall support\n(the rest) as a father. 3\n\n4\\. But in partition there is an increase of spiritual merit. 4\n\n5\\. (The additional share) of the eldest (son consists of) a twentieth part\n(of the estate), a male and a female (of animals with one row of front teeth,\nsuch as cows), a carriage yoked with animals that have two rows of front\nteeth, (and) a bull. 5\n\n6\\. (The additional share) of the middlemost (consists of) the one-eyed, old,\nhornless, and tailless animals, if there are several. 6\n\np. 304\n\n7\\. (The additional share) of the youngest (consists of) the sheep, grain, the\niron (utensils), a house, a cart yoked (with oxen), and one of each kind of\n(other) animals. 7\n\n8\\. All the remaining (property shall be divided) equally. 8\n\n9\\. Or let the eldest have two shares, 9\n\n10\\. And the rest one each. 10\n\n11\\. Or let them each take one kind of property, (selecting), according to\nseniority, what they desire, 11\n\n12\\. Ten head of cattle. 12\n\n13\\. (But) no (one brother shall) take (ten) one-hoofed beasts or (ten)\nslaves. 13\n\n14\\. (If a man has several wives) the additional 14\n\np. 305\n\nshare of the eldest son is one bull (in case he be born of a later-married\nwife);\n\n15\\. (But the eldest son) being born of the first-married wife (shall have)\nfifteen cows and one bull; 15\n\n16\\. Or (let the eldest son) who is born of a later-married wife (share the\nestate) equally with his younger (brethren born of the first-married wife). 16\n\n17\\. Or let the special shares (be adjusted) in each class (of sons) according\nto their mothers. 17\n\n18\\. A father who has no (male) issue may appoint his daughter (to raise up a\nson for him), presenting burnt offerings, to Agni (fire) and to Pra _g_ apati\n(the lord of creatures), and addressing (the bridegroom with these words),\n\'For me be (thy male) offspring.\' 18\n\n19\\. Some declare, that (a daughter becomes) an appointed daughter solely by\nthe intention (of the father).\n\n20\\. Through fear of that (a man) should not marry a girl who has no brothers.\n20\n\n21\\. Sapi _n_ _d_ as (blood relations within six degrees), Sagotras (relations\nbearing a common family name), (or) those connected by descent from the same\n_Ri_ shi 21\n\np. 306\n\n[paragraph continues] (vaidika gotra), and the wife shall share (the estate)\nof a person deceased without (male) issue (or an appointed daughter).\n\n22\\. Or (the widow) may seek to raise up offspring (to her deceased husband).\n22\n\n23\\. (A son) begotten on a (widow) whose husband\'s brother lives, by another\n(relative), is excluded from inheritance. 23\n\n24\\. A woman\'s separate property (goes) to her unmarried daughters, and (on\nfailure of such) to poor (married daughters). 24\n\n25\\. The sister\'s fee belongs to her uterine brothers, if her mother be dead.\n25\n\n26\\. Some (declare, that it belongs to them) even while the mother lives. 26\n\n27\\. The heritage of not reunited (brothers) deceased 27\n\np. 307\n\n[paragraph continues] (without male issue goes) to the eldest (brother).\n\n28\\. If a reunited coparcener dies (without male issue) his reunited\ncoparcener takes the heritage. 28\n\n29\\. A son born after partition takes exclusively (the wealth) of his father.\n29\n\n30\\. What a learned (coparcener) has acquired by his own efforts, he may (at\nhis pleasure) withhold from his unlearned (coparceners). 30\n\n31\\. Unlearned (coparceners) shall divide (their acquisitions) equally. 31\n\n32\\. A legitimate son, a son begotten on the wife (by a kinsman), an adopted\nson, a son made, a son born secretly, and a son abandoned (by his natural\nparents) inherit the estate (of their fathers). 32\n\n33\\. The son of an unmarried damsel, the son of a pregnant bride, the son of a\ntwice-married woman, the son of an appointed daughter, a son self-given, and a\nson bought belong to the family (of their fathers).\n\n34\\. On failure of a legitimate son or (of the) 34\n\np. 308\n\nother (five heirs) they receive a fourth (of the estate).\n\n35\\. The son of a Brahma _n_ a by a Kshatriya wife, being the eldest and\nendowed with good qualities, shares equally (with a younger brother, born of a\nBrahma _n_ i); 35\n\n36\\. (But he shall) not (obtain) the additional share of an eldest son. 36\n\n37\\. If there are sons begotten (by a Brahma _n_ a) on wives of the Kshatriya\nand Vai _s_ ya castes (the division of the estate between them takes place\naccording to the same rules) as (between) the (son by a Kshatriya wife) and\nthe son by a Brahma _n_ i. 37\n\n38\\. And (the sons by a Kshatriya wife and by\n\np. 309\n\na Vai _s_ ya wife share in the same manner) if (they have been begotten) by a\nKshatriya (father).\n\n39\\. The son by a _S_ udra wife even, if he be obedient like a pupil, receives\na provision for maintenance (out of the estate) of a (Brahma _n_ a) deceased\nwithout (other) male issue. 39\n\n40\\. According to some, the son of a woman of equal caste even does not\ninherit, if he be living unrighteously. 40\n\n41\\. _S_ rotriyas shall divide the estate of a childless Brahma _n_ a. 41\n\n42\\. The king (shall take the property of men) of other (castes). 42\n\n43\\. An idiot and a eunuch must be supported. 43\n\n44\\. The (male) offspring of an idiot receives (his father\'s) share. 44\n\n45\\. (Sons begotten) on women of higher castes (by men of lower castes shall\nbe treated) like sons (begotten by a Brahma _n_ a) on a _S_ udra wife. 45\n\np. 310\n\n46\\. Water, (property destined for) pious uses or sacrifices, and prepared\nfood shall not be divided; 46\n\n47\\. Nor (shall a partition be made) of women connected (with members of the\nfamily). 47\n\n48\\. In cases for which no rule has been given, (that course) must be followed\nof which at least ten (Brahma _n_ as), who are well instructed, skilled in\nreasoning, and free from covetousness, approve.\n\n49\\. They declare, that an assembly (parishad, shall consist) at least (of the\nten following (members, viz.) four men who have completely studied the four\nVedas, three men belonging to the (three) orders enumerated first, (and) three\nmen who know (three) different (institutes of) law. 49\n\n50\\. But on failure of them the decision of one _S_ rotriya, who knows the\nVeda and is properly instructed (in the duties, shall be followed) in doubtful\ncases.\n\n51\\. For such a man is incapable of (unjustly) injuring or (unjustly)\nfavouring created beings.\n\n52\\. He who knows the sacred law obtains heavenly bliss, more than (other)\nrighteous men, on account of his knowledge of, and his adherence to it.\n\n53\\. Thus the sacred law (has been explained).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[302:1](sbe0292.htm#fr_1483) **XXVIII**. Colebrooke, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 4;\nMitakshara I, 2, 7; p. 303 V, Digest 20; Mayukha IV, 4, 3. Haradatta remarks\nthat, according to Gautama, the sons alone shall divide the estate, and that\nthe mother is not to receive a share, as other teachers, e.g. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya II, 123, prescribe. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 13, 2 Manu IX, 104; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya II, 117.\n\n[303:2](sbe0292.htm#fr_1484) Colebrooke and Mayukha loc. cit. Or the sons may\ndivide the estate even during the lifetime of the father; when be desires it,\ni.e. by his permission. The time for such a (division is) when the mother is\npast child-bearing.\'--Haradatta. The correctness of this interpretation of our\nSutra is corroborated by the exclusion of sons who have divided the family\nestate against the father\'s will (XV, 19) from the _S_ raddha dinner.\n\xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 14, 1.\n\n[303:3](sbe0292.htm#fr_1485) Colebrooke, Dayabhaga III, 1, 15; Manu IX, 105.\n\n[303:4](sbe0292.htm#fr_1486) Colebrooke, Dayabhaga III, 1, 14; V, Digest 47.\nAfter division each brother has to perform the Vai _s_ vadeva and the other\ndomestic ceremonies separately, while in a united family they are performed by\nthe eldest brother. Thus a division of the family estate causes an increase of\nspiritual merit; see also Manu XI, III.\n\n[303:5](sbe0292.htm#fr_1487) Colebrooke, Dayabhaga II, 37; V, Digest 47; Manu\nIX, 112.\n\n[303:6](sbe0292.htm#fr_1488) Colebrooke II. cit. \'And that (additional share\nis given), if of the one-eyed and the rest there are several, i.e. if the\nothers also get (some).\'\n\n[304:7](sbe0292.htm#fr_1489) Colebrooke II. cit. \'Avi _h_ (a sheep), i.e. an\nanimal having a fleece. The singular number (is used to denote) the species,\n(and the explanation is), "As many sheep as there are." For (the possession\nof) one would follow already from the phrase, "And one of each kind of\nanimals." Another (commentator says), "Though the father may possess one sheep\nonly, still it belongs to the youngest, and the phrase \'one of each kind of\nanimals\' refers to the case when there are many." . . . This (additional share\nis that) belonging to the youngest. (If there are more than three sons) the\nothers obtain the share of the middle most.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[304:8](sbe0292.htm#fr_1490) Colebrooke II. cit.\n\n[304:9](sbe0292.htm#fr_1491) Colebrooke, Dayabhaga II, 3 7; V, Digest 51. My\nbest copy P. leaves out this Sutra and the next. The others read dvya _m_ _s_\ni va purva _g_ a _h_ (not purva _g_ asya, as Professor Stenzler reads), and\nexplain the former word as follows, \'dvava _m_ _s_ au dvya _m_ _s_ a _m_\ntadasyastiti dvya _m_ _s_ i.\' Manu II, 117.\n\n[304:10](sbe0292.htm#fr_1492) Colebrooke II. cit.\n\n[304:11](sbe0292.htm#fr_1493) Colebrooke V, Digest 68.\n\n[304:12](sbe0292.htm#fr_1494) Colebrooke loc. cit. The meaning, appears to be\nthat no brother is to select more than ten head of cattle.\n\n[304:13](sbe0292.htm#fr_1495) Colebrooke V, Digest 69. But, as has been\ndeclared above (Sutra 11), one of each kind only. In the case of the v. 1.\ndvipadanam, the word pada (step) is used in the sense of the word pada\n(foot).\'--Haradatta.\n\n[304:14](sbe0292.htm#fr_1496) Colebrooke V, Digest 58; Manu IX, 123.\n\n[305:15](sbe0292.htm#fr_1497) Colebrooke loc. cit.; Manu IX, 124.\n\n[305:16](sbe0292.htm#fr_1498) Colebrooke loc. cit.\n\n[305:17](sbe0292.htm#fr_1499) Colebrooke V, Digest 59. \'After having divided\nthe estate into as many portions as there are wives who possess sons, and\nhaving united as many shares as there are sons (of each mother), let the\neldest in each class (of uterine brothers) receive the additional share of\none-twentieth and so forth.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[305:18](sbe0292.htm#fr_1500)-19. Colebrooke V, Digest 225; Manu IX, 130-140.\n\n[305:20](sbe0292.htm#fr_1501) Manu III, 11; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 53.\n\n[305:21](sbe0292.htm#fr_1502) Colebrooke, Dayabhaga XI, 6, 25; Mitakshara II,\n1, 18; V, Digest 440. My copies as well as _G_ imutavahana and Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ane\n_s_ vara read in the text stri va, \'or the wife,\' instead of stri _k_ a, p.\n306 \'and the wife.\' Still the latter seems to be the reading recognised by\nHaradatta, as he says, \'But the wife is joined together (samu _k_ _k_ iyate)\nwith all the Sagotras and the rest. When the Sagotras and the rest inherit,\nthen the wife shall inherit one share with them,\' &c. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 14, 2;\nManu IX, 187; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 135-136.\n\n[306:22](sbe0292.htm#fr_1503) Colebrooke, Mitakshara II, 1, 8, where this\nSutra has, however, been combined with the preceding. See also above, XVIII,\n4-8; Manu IX, 145-146, 190.\n\n[306:23](sbe0292.htm#fr_1504) Colebrooke V, Digest 341; Manu IX, 144.\n\n[306:24](sbe0292.htm#fr_1505) Colebrooke, Dayabhaga IV, 2, 13; Mitakshara I,\n3, 11; II, 2, 4; V, Digest 490; Mayukha IV, 8,12.

That goes after his\n(the father\'s) death to the uterine brothers of that sister; and that\n(happens) after the mother\'s death. But if the mother is alive (it goes) to\nher.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[306:26](sbe0292.htm#fr_1507) Colebrooke V, Digest 511.\n\n[306:27](sbe0292.htm#fr_1508) Colebrooke V, Digest 424. \'The word "eldest" is\nused p. 307 to give an example.

Colebrooke V, Digest 184 Mayukha IX,\n166-178; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 128-132. My best copy P. inserts another Sutra\nbetween this and the following one, ete tu gotrabhaga _h_ , \'but these (latter\nsix) belong to the family (only, and do not inherit).\'\n\n[307:34](sbe0292.htm#fr_1514) Colebrooke V, Digest 184. The residue of the\nestate p. 308 goes to the Sapi _n_ _d_ as. If it is here stated that the son\nof an appointed daughter receives, even on failure of a legitimate son, a\nfourth part of the estate only, that refers to the son of an appointed\ndaughter of lower caste, i.e. to a son who is born, when somebody makes the\ndaughter of a wife of lower caste his appointed daughter, and does that by\nintent only.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[308:35](sbe0292.htm#fr_1515) Colebrooke V, Digest 158; Manu IX, 149-153; Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 12 5. If the son of a Brahma _n_ a by a Kshatriya wife is\nendowed with good qualities and the eldest, then he shares equally with a\nyounger son by a Brahma _n_ i. For the one possesses seniority by age and the\nother by caste.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[308:36](sbe0292.htm#fr_1516) Colebrooke loc. cit. \'What is exclusive of the\nadditional share of the eldest, which has been declared above, Sutra 5, (that)\nother (part) he shall obtain. The verb must be understood from the context.\nRegarding a son by a Kshatriya wife who is the eldest, but destitute of good\nqualities, the Manava Dharma- _s_ astra declares (IX, 152-153), "Or (if no\ndeduction be made)," &c.\'--Haradatta. The sense in which the Sutra has been\ntaken above, agrees with the explanation of the Ratnakara adduced in the\nDigest loc. cit., though the reading of the text followed there seems to be\ndifferent.\n\n[308:37](sbe0292.htm#fr_1517)-38. Colebrooke V, Digest 159. In the Digest V,\n160, an additional Sutra regarding the partition between the sons of a p. 309\nVai _s_ ya by Vai _s_ ya and _S_ udra wives is quoted, which, however, is not\nrecognised by Haradatta.\n\n[309:39](sbe0292.htm#fr_1518) Colebrooke V, Digest 169; Mayukha IV, 4. 30.\n\'(The word) of a Brahma _n_ a must be understood (from Sutra 35).\'--Haradatta.\n\n[309:40](sbe0292.htm#fr_1519) Colebrooke V.
