The King Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! I am not satiated with the\ndrink of the divine sweet nectar-like words coming out of your lotus mouth.\nYou have described to me in detail the wonderful and variegated story of the\norigin of the Haihaya dynasty; but, O Muni! There has arisen in my mind a\ncuriosity to know something more on this subject. See the Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u,\nthe Lord of Lak _s_ mi, the Deva of the Devas, the Ruler of this whole\nUniverse and the Cause of the Creation, Preservation and Destruction; yet that\nBest of Puru _s_ as S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan had to assume a horse form. He is undecaying\nand independent, how then He came to be dependent? Clear this doubt of mine. O\nBest of Munis! You are omniscient; therefore satisfy my curiosity by\ndescribing this wonderful event.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n6-16. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hear what I heard of yore from Narada how this\ndoubt was removed. The mind-born son of Brahma, Mahar _s_ i Narada got powers\nto go everywhere by virtue of his Tapas, could know everything, was of a calm\nand quiet nature, dear to all and he was a poet. On one occasion he went out\non tour round the world, playing with his lute in time with Svar and Tan. One\nday he came to my \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama, singing many things concerning Brihat Rathantara\nSama Veda and the sweet nectar-like Gayatri, the Giver of Liberation. O King!\nThere was a very sacred place of hermitage, beaming as it were with happiness\nand self-knowledge, named S\xc2\x92amyaprasa, on the banks of the river Sarasvati.\nThere was situated my hermitage. Seeing the lustrous Narada the son of the\nGrand Sire Brahma, coming, I got up and offered him duly Padya (water to wash\nhis feet) and Argha (offerings of worship), etc., and worshipped him. When\nthat Muni of indomitable lustre took his seat on the \xc3\x82sana, I sat beside him.\nWhen I found Narada, the Giver of Knowledge, at rest and quiet, I duly asked\nhim the very same question that you have asked me just now. O Best of Munis!\nWhat happiness is there on the beings taking their birth in this world. I\nnever found it in any place or in any concern, this I can say positively.\nStill why do the high minded persons do Karma, fascinated by the enchantments\nof the world. Look! I was born in an island. Just after my birth, my mother\nforsook me. Helpless, I grew in the forest as my Karma allowed. Next I\nperformed a very severe tapasya before Mahadeva, the Deva of the Devas, on the\nmountain with a desire to have a son.\n\n\n\np. 569\n\n\n\n17-38. As a fruit of that I got S\xc2\x92uka as my son, the foremost of the Gnostics,\nand taught him completely the essence of the Vedas from the beginning to the\nend. O Devar _s_ i! When my son got wisdom from you, he left this world even\nwhen I became very distressed on his bereavement and wept aloud and he went\naway to the next world. Very much afflicted for the parting of my son, I\nabandoned the great Mountain Meru. I got very lean due to the absence of my\ndear son whom I loved very much; and becoming very distressed and knowing this\nwhole world to be an illusion, I remembered my mother and went to the Kuru Ja\n_n_ gala district, as if bound up and controlled by the snares of Maya. When I\nheard that the King S\xc2\x92antanu had married my mother, I built my hermitage on\nthe holy banks of the Sarasvati and remained there. When the King S\xc2\x92antanu\nwent to the next world, my chaste mother remained with two sons. At that time\nBhi _s_ ma looked after their sustenance and maintained them. The intelligent\nGanga\xc2\x92s son Bhi _s_ ma Deva installed Chitrangada on the throne. A short while\nafter this, Chitrangada, too, looking like a second Cupid and extremely\nlovely, went to the jaws of death. The mother Satyavati was drowned in the\nsorrows for his son Chitrangada and began to weep for him. O King! Knowing my\nmother in that sorrowful condition, I went to her. Bhi _s_ ma and I then\nconsoled her with hopeful words. Bhi _s_ ma Deva was averse to marrying and\nthen becoming a King; and, therefore, he installed again the younger brother,\nthe powerful Vichitravirya on the throne. O King! Bhi _s_ ma defeated by his\nown prowess the kings and brought the two daughters of the King Kas\xc2\x92iraj and\nhanded them over to Satyavati, so that she might give them over to\nVichitravirya. Then, on an auspicious day, and in an auspicious Lagna (moment)\nwhen the marriage ceremony of my brother Vichitravirya was performed, I became\nglad. My brother, a good archer, was shortly afterwards attacked with\nconsumption and thus he died without any issue. At this my mother became very\nsad and dejected. Seeing the husband dead, the two daughters of Kas\xc2\x92iraja\nbecame ready to preserve their religion of chastity and said to their mother-\nin-law, sorrowful and weeping :-- We two shall accompany our husbands and\nbecome Sati (i.e., be burnt up with our husbands). O Devi! We will go to the\nHeavens with your son. We, the two sisters united, will enjoy with him in the\nNandana Garden. The mother was very much attached to them and with the\npermission of Bhi _s_ ma Deva, very affectionately made them desist from this\ngreat attempt. When all the funeral obsequies of Vichitravirya were over, my\nmother consulted with Bhi _s_ ma and remembered me in Hastinanagara. As soon\nas she remembered me, immediately I knew her mental feelings and hurriedly\ncame to Hastinanagara\n\n\n\np. 570\n\n\n\nand, with my head bowed, fell prostrate before her feet, and with folded hands\naddressed my mother who was very much inflamed with the fire of sorrow for the\ndeath of her son, thus :-- O Mother! Why have you called me here mentally? I\nsee you are very much dejected; I am your servant; order me what I can do for\nyou. O Mother! You are my greatest place of pilgrimage and you are my highest\ndeity; I am very anxious since I have come here; say what you desire.\n\n\n\n39-44. Vyasa said :-- O Best of Munis! When I said thus and waited before her,\nthen she looked at Bhi _s_ ma standing close by and said :-- \xc2\x93O Child! Your\nbrother died of consumption; therefore I am very sorrowful, lest the family\nbecomes extinct. O Intelligent One! For the continuance of the line, then,\nwith the permission of the Ganga\xc2\x92s son, I have called you here today by the\nSamadhi Yoga. O son of Paras\xc2\x92ara! You re-establish the name of S\xc2\x92antanu that\nis going now to be well nigh extinct. O Vyasa Deva! Relieve me soon from this\nsorrow of mine, lest this line be extinct. There are the two daughters of\nKas\xc2\x92iraja, honest and good and endowed with youth and beauty. O Highly\nIntelligent One! Better you cohabit with them and save the family of Bharata\nby begetting sons. You will not be touched with any sin.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n45-55. Vyasa said :-- O Devar _s_ i! Hearing the mother\xc2\x92s words, I became very\nanxious and humbly told her with great shame :-- \xc2\x93O Mother! To touch another\xc2\x92s\nwife is a very sinful act; knowing well the path of Dharma, how can I\nwillingly and intentionally violate that? So also, the Mahar _s_ is say :--\nThat the wife of a younger brother is like a daughter. Studying all the Vedas,\nhow can I do this blame-worthy and adulterous act? To preserve a line of\nfamily by illegal ways is never to be done; for then the fathers of the\nsinners can never cross this ocean of world. How can he, who is the spiritual\npreceptor of all, and the writer of all the Pura _n_ as, do this act knowingly\nwhich is awfully strange and very bad and nasty in its nature.\xc2\x94 My mother was\nvery much plunged into the sea of sorrows for the bereavement of her son; so\nto preserve the family, She came again to me, weeping and said :-- \xc2\x93O son of\nParas\xc2\x92ara! If you follow my word, you won\xc2\x92t incur any sin. O Child! If the\nreasonable words of the Gurus be even faulty, one should obey them according\nto the tradition of the S\xc2\x92i _st_ as. Therefore, O Child! Keep my word and\npreserve my honour; no sin will touch you. O Child! Think very well. Your\nmother is very sorry and is immersed in the ocean of afflictions; therefore it\nis your paramount duty to make her happy by begetting child for the\ncontinuance of the family.\xc2\x94 Hearing my mother speaking to me thus, Bhi _s_ ma,\nthe Ganga\xc2\x92s son, the expert\n\n\n\np. 571\n\n\n\nin finding out truth in fine points with regard to Dharma, said to me :-- O\nDvaipayana! You are wholly sinless; you ought not therefore to argue on this\npoint; obey your mother as she says and be happy.\n\n\n\n56-61. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing his words and my mother\xc2\x92s request, I\ndecided to do this very hateful act with a fearless heart without any\nsuspicion. When Ambika finished her ablutions after menstruation, I gladly\ncohabited with her in the night; but that young lady seeing my ugly ascetic\nform, was not attached to me; I then cursed that beautiful woman thus :-- As\nyou closed your eyes at the first cohabitation with me, your son will be born\nblind. O Muni! On the second day my mother enquired me when I was alone :-- O\nDvaipayana! Will there be born a son of the daughter of Kas\xc2\x92iraj? I then bowed\nmy head with shame, and told, \xc2\x93Mother! The son will be born blind, through my\ncurse.\xc2\x94 O Muni! The mother then rebuked me harshly, \xc2\x93O Child! Why did you\ncurse that the son of Ambika would be born blind?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-fourth Chapter in the Sixth Book on the description of\nVik _s_ epa S\xc2\x92akti in the discourse between Vyasa and Narada in the Mahapura\n_n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 25](bk06ch25.htm)\n\n'
