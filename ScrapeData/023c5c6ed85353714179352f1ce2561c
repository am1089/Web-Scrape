Narada said :-- O Best of Munis! The King was greatly astonished to see\nme dip in the tank in a female figure and get up from the tank in a male\nfigure and thought, \xc2\x93Where is my dearest wife? And how is this Narada Muni\nsuddenly come here!\xc2\x94 The King, not seeing his wife, lamented very much and\ncried frequently, \xc2\x93O my dear Wife! Where have you gone, leaving me here thus.\nWithout you, O One of spacious hips! My life, palace and\n\n\n\np. 589\n\n\n\nkingdom, all, are quite useless. O Lotus-eyed one! What shall I do? O Smiling\nOne! Why is not my life getting out of my body, suffering thus from thy\nseparation? Without you, my sentiment of love has left me for ever. O Large-\neyed One! Now I am lamenting for you. O Dear! Better give me your sweet reply;\nthe love that you expressed at our first union, where has it gone now? O One\nwith good eyebrows! Are you sunk in the water and have you given up your life?\nOr are you devoured by fishes or crocodiles? Or are you carried away by Varu\n_n_ a, the Deva of the waters, to my great misfortune? O One of beautiful\nlimbs! You are blessed, as you have gone away with your sons; O sweet-speaking\nOne! Your affection for them was not artificial. Is it right for you to go up\nto the Heavens, attached by affection for your sons, leaving me your\ndistressed husband alone, thus weeping for your separation? O Dear! I have\nlost both, you and my sons; yet death is not carrying me away; O! How hard is\nmy lot! What to do? Where to go? Rama is not now in this world. He knew what\nwas the pain caused by the separation from one\xc2\x92s dearest wife. Oh! The cruel\nFate has ordained very unwisely with great inconsistency the periods of\nparting from one another at different periods; when their minds and all other\nthings are exactly the same in all circumstances of pleasure and pain. The\npractice of Sati (burning with one\xc2\x92s deceased husband), as ordained by the\nMunis, is certainly for the good of the chaste women; but it would have been\ngood no doubt, were there such practices allowed for the men to burn\nthemselves with their deceased wives.\xc2\x94 Bhagavan Hari then spoke to the\nlamenting King in reasonable words and consoled him thus :-- \xc2\x93O King! Why are\nyou thus troubling yourself with pain and sorrow? Where has gone your dearest\nwife? Have you not heard anything of S\xc2\x92astras? or Have you not taken any\nshelter of any wise man!\n\n\n\n15-27. Who was your wife? Who are you? Of what nature was your union and\ndisunion and where did it take place? The union of wives and sons in this\nS\xc2\x92amsara is momentary like the meetings of persons on boats, while crossing a\nriver. O King! Now go home, there is no use in your weeping thus in vain; the\nunion and disunion of men are always under the control of Fate, the Daiva;\ntherefore the wise should not lament for them. O King! Your union with the\nwoman took place here; and now you have lost that beautiful, thin-bodied,\nlarge-eyed woman here also. Her father and mother you have not seen; you have\ngot her like what is heard in the story of the crow and the Tal fruit; as you\ngot her wonderfully, so you have lost her wonderfully. O King! Do not grieve;\nTime cannot be ruled over; go home and\n\n\n\np. 590\n\n\n\nenjoy yourself subservient to Time. That beautiful woman has gone away in the\nmanner she came to you; you ought to do your stately affairs in the way as you\nused to do before as the ruler of all. O King! Consider that if you weep day\nand night, that women will never return; why then are you giving vent to your\nsorrows in vain? Go now and have recourse to the path of the Yoga and thus\nwhile away your time. The enjoyable things come in course of time and they go\naway again in due course; therefore in this world of no gain whatsoever, the\nwise should never lament. Continuous pleasure or continuous pain does not\nalways take place; pleasure and pain are never steady; they rotate always like\na rotary instrument. Therefore, O King! Make your mind calm and quiet and rule\nhappily your kingdom; or make over the charge of the kingdom to your sons and\nretire to the forest. This human body is seldom obtained; it is frail;\ntherefore getting that body it is advisable to practise the realisation of the\nSupreme. O King! This organ of generation and this tongue reside also with the\nbeasts, the peculiarity of human body is that knowledge can be realised in it;\nnot in any other\n\ninferior births. Therefore leave your home, leave your sorrows for your wife;\nall this is the Maya of Bhagavan; by Her the world is deluded.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n28-37. Narada said :-- Bhagavan Hari speaking thus, the King bowed down to\nHim, the Deva of the Devas and finishing the bathing duties returned to his\nhome. He then became possessed of dispassion and discrimination and making\nover the charge of his kingdom to his grandsons retired to the forest and\nrealised the Supreme Knowledge. When the King went away, the Bhagavan began to\nlaugh and laugh, seeing me again and again. I then told him, \xc2\x93O Deva! You have\ndeceived me. I now come to know how great is the power of Maya. O Janardana!\nNow I remember all that I did in my feminine form. Tell me, O Hari! O Deva of\nthe Devas! How I lost my previous consciousness, when I got down into the tank\nand bathed in it. O Lord of the world! Why was I enchanted, when I got the\nfemale form and when I got the King as my husband like S\xc2\x92achi\xc2\x92s getting Indra.\nThe same mind I had; the old Jivatma was there and the previous subtle body\nwas there; how, then, I lost their memories? O Lord! Give out the cause of it\nand clear my doubts; a great doubt has arisen in my mind. Many enjoyments I\nhad in my female form, drinking liquor and other prohibited things I tasted; O\nSlayer of Madhu! What is the cause of all these? I could not know then that I\nwas Narada, as I now recognise clearly what I was in and what I did in my\nfemale form. Say the Why of all these things.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n38-53. Vi _sn_ u said :-- \xc2\x93Know, O Intelligent Narada! That all this\n\n\n\np. 591\n\n\n\nis merely the Pastime of Maya. There are many states going on in the bodies of\nall the living beings. The embodied beings have got their waking, dream, deep\nsleep and Turiya (beyond all the three above-mentioned) states; then why you\ndoubt that when there is another body, there would be also the change in the\nstates? When a man sleeps, he knows not anything, he does not hear anything;\nbut when he gets awake, he again comes to know everything completely. The\nChitta gets itself moved by sleep; then mind gets different states by dreams\nand there arises a variety of feelings. A mad elephant is coming to kill me,\nand I am not able to fly away. What to do? Where to go? There is no place\nwhere I can quickly go; thus, in dreams, there arise different mental states.\nSometimes we see in dreams that our departed grandfathers are come in our\nhouses. I am seeing them, talking with them and I am dining with them.\nWhatever pain and pleasure are felt in dreams, when they awake, they know of\nwhat happened in their dreams and can also describe in details, recollecting\nwhat had then happened. O Narada! Know the power of Maya incomprehensible as\nthe things seen in dreams cannot be certainly known that all those are false.\nO Muni! Neither I, nor S\xc2\x92ambhu, nor Brahma can measure the power wielded by\nMaya and Her three Gu _n_ as, very hard to fathom. How, then, can any ordinary\nmortal know them! Therefore, O Narada! None is able to fathom the Maya. This\nworld, moving and non-moving, is fashioned out of the triple Gu _n_ as of the\nMaya; nothing whatsoever can exist without them. The predominant Gu _n_ a in\nMe is Sattva; but Rajas and Tamas exist in me; being the Lord of this world, I\ncannot override the three Gu _n_ as. So your father, Brahma, is predominant in\nRajo Gu _n_ a; but Sattva and Tamas never leave Him, Our Maha Deva is\npredominant in Tamo Gu _n_ a, but Sattva and Rajo are always with him.\nTherefore, no being can exist as separate from the three Gu _n_ as; this point\nI have settled in S\xc2\x92ruti. Therefore, O Lord of the Munis! Quit this endless\nMoha for the world, caused by Maya, and very hard to get over and worship\nBhagavati, Who is of the nature of Brahma _n_. O Intelligent One! Now you have\nseen the power of Maya; and you have enjoyed many things produced by Maya and\nyou have realised the extremely wonderful nature of Her. Then why do you ask\nme further on this point?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirtieth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the glory of Maha Maya in\nthe Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 31](bk06ch31.htm)\n\n'
