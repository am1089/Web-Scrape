And on account of the defects of his view also.\n\nOn his view, i.e. on the view of him who holds the theory of the Pradhana or\nsomething similar, the imperfections observed in ordinary things would attach\nthemselves to the Pradhana also, since it does not differ in nature from those\nthings. The legitimate conclusion therefore is that Brahman only which differs\nin nature from all other things can be held to be the general cause.\n\nThe Pradhana, moreover, is without parts; how then is it possible that it\nshould give rise to a manifold world, comprising the 'great principle,' and so\non?--But there _are_ parts of the Pradhana, viz. Goodness, Passion, and\nDarkness!--This we reply necessitates the following distinction. Does the\naggregate of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness constitute the Pradhana? or is\nthe Pradhana the effect of those three? The latter alternative is in conflict\nwith your own doctrine according to which the Pradhana is cause only. It\nmoreover contradicts the number of tattvas (viz. 24) admitted by you; and as\nthose three gu _n_ as also have no parts one does not see how they can produce\nan effect. On the former alternative, the gu _n_ as not being composed of\nparts must be held to aggregate or join themselves without any reference to\ndifference of space, and from such conjunction the production of gross effects\ncannot result.--The same objection applies to the doctrine of atoms being the\ngeneral cause. For atoms, being without parts and spatial distinction of\nparts, can join only without any reference to such spatial distinction, and\nhence do not possess the power of originating effects.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 30.
