On the passing away of the works, with a remainder, according to Scripture\nand Sm _ri_ ti; as it went and not so.\n\nThe text declares that those who only perform sacrifices and useful works\nascend by the road of the fathers, and again return to the earth when they\nhave fully enjoyed the fruit of their works, 'having dwelt there yavat sa _m_\npatam, they return by the same way' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 10, 5). The question here\narises whether the descending soul carries a certain remainder (anu _s_ aya)\nof its works or not.--It does not, since it has enjoyed the fruit of all its\nworks. For by 'anu _s_ aya' we have to understand that part of the karman\nwhich remains over and above the part retributively enjoyed; but when the\nfruit of the entire karman has been enjoyed, there is no such remainder. And\nthat this is so we learn from the phrase 'yavat sa _m_ patam\n\np. 590\n\nushitva,' which means 'having dwelt there as long as the karman lasts'\n(sampatanty anena svargalokam iti sampata _h_ ). Analogously another text\nsays, 'Having obtained the end of whatever deed he does on earth, he again\nreturns from that world to this world to action' (B _ri_. Up. V, 4, 6).--\nAgainst this prima facie view the Sutra declares 'with a remainder he\ndescends, on account of what is seen, i.e. scriptural text, and Sm _ri_ ti.'\nThe scriptural text is the one 'Those whose conduct has been good' (V, 10, 7),\nwhich means that among the souls that have returned, those whose karman is\ngood obtain a good birth as Brahma _n_ as or the like, while those whose\nkarman is bad are born again as low creatures-dogs, pigs, _K_ a _nd_ alas, and\nthe like. This shows that the souls which have descended are still connected\nwith good or evil karman. Sm _ri_ ti also declares this: 'Men of the several\ncastes and orders, who always stand firm in the works prescribed for them,\nenjoy after death the rewards of their works, and by virtue of a remnant (of\ntheir works) they are born again in excellent countries, castes and families,\nendowed with beauty, long life, learning in the Vedas, wealth, good conduct,\nhappiness and wisdom. Those who act in a contrary manner perish' (Gautama Dha.\nSu. XI, 29); 'Afterwards when a man returns to this world he obtains, by\nvirtue of a remainder of works, birth in a good family, beauty of form, beauty\nof complexion, strength, aptitude for learning, wisdom, wealth, and capacity\nfor fulfilling his duties. Therefore, rolling like a wheel (from the one to\nthe other), in both worlds he dwells in happiness' (\xc3\x82past. Dha. Su. II, 1, 2,\n3). The clause 'as long as his works last' (yavat-sa _m_ patam) refers to that\npart of his works only which was performed with a view to reward (as promised\nfor those works by the Veda); and the same holds true with regard to the\npassage 'whatever work man does here on earth' (B _ri_. Up. V, 4, 6). Nor is\nit possible that works, the fruit of which has not yet been enjoyed, and those\nthe result of which has not been wiped out by expiatory ceremonies, should be\ndestroyed by the enjoyment of the fruits of other works. Hence those who have\ngone to that world return with\n\np. 591\n\na remnant of their works, 'as they went and not so'--i.e. in the same way as\nthey ascended and also in a different way. For the ascent takes place by the\nfollowing stages--smoke, night, the dark half of the moon, the six months of\nthe sun's southern progress, the world of the fathers, ether, moon. The\ndescent, on the other hand, goes from the place of the moon, through ether,\nwind, smoke, mist, cloud. The two journeys are alike in so far as they pass\nthrough ether, but different in so far as the descent touches wind, and so on,\nand does not touch the world of the fathers, and other stages of the ascent.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 9.
