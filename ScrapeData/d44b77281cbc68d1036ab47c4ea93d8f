Cooking [1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:1:1) (the oblations?) the quick one has\napproached the sky. He has revealed the nights and what stands and moves\n[2](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:1:2)--\n\n2\\. When he the god, alone of all these gods [1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:2:1)\nencompassed (the others) by his greatness.\n\n3\\. When thou, O god, hadst been born living from the dry (wood), then all\n(gods and men?) were pleased with thy wisdom.\n\n4\\. They all obtained the name of divinity, of immortality\n[1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:4:1), serving the _Ri_ ta in due way.\n\n5\\. The instigations of _Ri_ ta, the thought of _Ri_ ta\n[1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:5:1): they all performed the works of [?] the full-\nlived one [2](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:5:2).\n\n6\\. Bestow wealth, thou who art the knowing one, on him who worships thee or\nwho does service to thee [1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:6:1).\n\n7\\. He who sits down as the Hot _ri_ among the offspring of Manu: he verily is\nthe master of all these riches.\n\n8\\. They longed together for the seed in their bodies\n[1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:8:1), and the wise ones were concordant among each\nother in their minds.\n\n9\\. They took pleasure in his will, as sons (take pleasure) in their father's\n(will), the quick ones who have listened to his command.\n\n10\\. He who is rich in food has opened the gates of wealth\n[1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:10:1). The householder (Agni) has adorned the sky\nwith stars.\n\np. 65\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Boehtlingk-Roth are wrong in deriving _s_ ri _n_ an (which should more\ncorrectly be written _s_ ri _n_ an, comp. my Prolegomena, 477) from the root\n_s_ ri. They supply an object like _s_ o _k_ i _h_ and translate: 'Licht\nverbreitend hebt er sich zum Himmel.'\n\nNote 2. Lanman, 422.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Bollensen conjectures deva\xc2\xb4nam deva _h_ (instead of deva _h_ deva\xc2\xb4nam)\nwhich seems to be right (comp. below, 69, 2), though this conjecture is not\nabsolutely necessary (see my Prolegomena, 97):\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Am _r i_tam belongs to na\xc2\xb4ma; comp. V, 57, 5. am _r i_tam na\xc2\xb4ma bhe\n_g_ ire; X, 123, 4. vidat gandharva _h_ am _r i_tani na\xc2\xb4ma.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. With _ri_ tasya dhiti _h_ comp. I, 71, 3; IV, 23, 8; IX, 76, 4; 97,\n34; 111, 2.--Prof. Max Muller thinks that _ri_ ta should be taken as a name of\nAgni: 'for the righteous (Agni) are the prayers, for the righteous the\ndevotion.'\n\nNote 2. Is vi _s_ va\xc2\xb4yu _h_ an adverb meaning 'eternally'? As vi _s_ va\xc2\xb4yu is\nan epithet of Agni frequently used in the Rig-veda and especially in the Para\n_s_ ara hymns (see 67, 6. 10; 68, 5; 73, 4), one feels tempted to read vi _s_\nva\xc2\xb4yo _h_ (comp. IV, 42, 1. rash _t_ ram kshatriyasya vi _s_ va\xc2\xb4yo _h_ ).\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Comp. III, 59, 2. ya _h_ te aditya _s_ ikshati vratena.\n\np. 66\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Some light is thrown on this obscure verse by the hymn, I, 72, a hymn\nbelonging, as our hymn does, to the Para _s_ ara collection. It is shown by\nthe second verse of that hymn (see below), that the searching ones, 'amura _h_\n,' are the gods who seek Agni. It seems probable, consequently, that the\n'seed' is Agni (comp. I, 164, 35, where Soma is said to be v _r i_sh _n_ a _h_\na _s_ vasya reta _h_ , 'the seed of the manly horse'). Of the same searching\ngods in I, 72, 5 the expression sa _m_ _g_ anana\xc2\xb4 _h_ is used; comp. sam _g_\nanata in our passage.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Ra\xc2\xb4ya _h_ must be a genitive; comp. I, 72, 8. raya _h_ dura _h_ vi\n_ri_ ta _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\xc2\xb4 _h_ a _g_ anan. Probably the accent should be raya _h_ ;\ncomp., however, Lanman, 431.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 69](sbe46019.htm)\n\n"
