Now this Vedi (altar-ground, viz. the Mahavedi of the Soma-\nsacrifice) is just that (right) measure for the Vedi of the sevenfold 3 (fire-\naltar).\n\np. 307\n\n[paragraph continues] Having fixed upon (the place for) the sacrificial\nground, he enters the Patni _s_ ala 1 by the front (east) door, and having\nthrown up (the ground) for the Garhapatya, he sprinkles it with water. From\nthe raised (site) of the Garhapatya he strides seven steps eastward. From\nthere he measures off a fathom 2 towards the east, and having, in the middle\nthereof, thrown up (the ground) for the \xc3\x82havaniya, he sprinkles it with water.\nFrom the front part of the fathom he strides three steps eastward: that is the\nend of the Vedi 3.\n\n10:2:3:22\\. Now, there are here, including the fathom (as one), eleven steps 4\nbetween the end of the Vedi and the (original) Garhapatya;--the Trish _t_ ubh\nconsists\n\np. 308\n\nof eleven syllables, and the Trish _t_ ubh is a thunderbolt, and the Trish _t_\nubh means strength: it is thus by the thunderbolt, and by strength, that the\nSacrificer from the very first drives off the fiends, the Rakshas, from the\nmouth of the sacrifice.\n\n10:2:3:33\\. This is the womb of the Vedi, for it was from that womb that the\ngods begat the Vedi. And that (space of a) fathom which was (marked off), is\nthe womb of the Garhapatya 1, for it was from that womb that the gods begat\nthe Garhapatya; and from the Garhapatya the \xc3\x82havaniya.\n\n10:2:3:44\\. From the (western) end of the Vedi he measures off the Vedi 2\nthirty-six steps long eastward, thirty (steps) broad behind, and twenty-four\n(steps broad) in front,--that makes ninety. This, then, is the Vedi measuring\nninety steps: thereon he lays out the sevenfold Fire-altar.\n\n10:2:3:55\\. As to this they say, 'How does this sevenfold (Person, the fire-\naltar,) correspond to this Vedi (measuring ninety steps)?' Well, there are\nthese\n\np. 309\n\nten vital airs in a man 1, four limbs, and the trunk as the fifteenth; in the\nsame way in the second, and in the same way in the third (man),--in six men\nthis makes ninety; and one man remains over. Now, (that seventh) man is\nfivefold--hair, skin, flesh, bone, and marrow (fat), and this Vedi also is\nfivefold--the four regions (quarters), and the body (of the altar) as the\nfifth 2: thus this sevenfold (altar) does indeed correspond to this Vedi.\n\n10:2:3:66\\. Now, some, intending to construct higher forms (of altars),\nincrease (the number of) these steps and this fathom accordingly, saying, 'We\nenlarge the womb in accordance therewith;'--but let him not do so; for the\nwomb does not enlarge along with the child that has been born 3, but, indeed,\nonly as long as the child is within the womb, does the womb enlarge, and so\nlong, indeed, the growth of the (unborn) child here (lasts) 4.\n\n10:2:3:77\\. Indeed, those who do it in that way, deprive this Father Pra _g_\napati of his due proportions; and they will become the worse for sacrificing,\nfor they deprive Father Pra _g_ apati of his due proportions.\n\np. 310\n\n[paragraph continues] As large as this Vedi 1 of the sevenfold (fire-altar)\nis, fourteen times as large he measures out the Vedi of the one hundred and\none-fold (altar).\n\n10:2:3:88\\. He now measures off a cord thirty-six steps 2 (yards) long, and\nfolds it up into seven (equal) parts: of this he covers (the . space of) the\nthree front (eastern) parts (with bricks), and leaves four (parts) 3 free.\n\n10:2:3:99\\. He then measures (a cord) thirty steps long, and lays it\nsevenfold: of this he covers three parts (with bricks) behind, and leaves four\n(parts) free 4.\n\np. 311\n\n10:2:3:1010\\. He then measures (a cord) twenty-four steps long, and lays it\nsevenfold: of this he covers three parts in front (with bricks), and leaves\nfour (parts) free 1. This, then, is the measuring out of the Vedi.\n\n10:2:3:1111\\. Now as to the (other) forms of the fire-altar. Twenty-eight\nman's lengths long (from west to east) and twenty-eight man's lengths across\nis the body (of the altar), fourteen man's lengths the right, and fourteen the\nleft wing, and fourteen the tail. Fourteen cubits (aratni) he covers (with\nbricks) on the right, and fourteen on the left wing, and fourteen spans\n(vitasti) on the tail. Such is the measure of (an altar of) ninety-eight man's\nlengths with the additional space (for wings and tail).\n\n10:2:3:1212\\. He now measures a cord of three man's lengths, and lays it\nsevenfold: of this he covers (the space of) four parts (with bricks) on the\nbody (of the altar), and three parts on the wings and tail.\n\n10:2:3:1313\\. He then measures one three cubits long, and lays it sevenfold:\nof this he covers (the space of) three parts on the right, and three on the\nleft wing, and leaves four (parts) free.\n\n10:2:3:1414\\. He then measures one a span long, and lays it sevenfold: of this\nhe covers (the space of) three parts on the tail, and leaves four (parts)\nfree. In this way does this one hundred and one-fold (Agni) correspond to this\nVedi.\n\n10:2:3:1515\\. As to this they say, 'When thirteen man's lengths are over, how\nis it that these do not deviate\n\np. 312\n\nfrom the right proportions (of the altar) 1?' Well, what right proportions\nthere were in the case of that seventh man's length 2, these same proportions\n(also apply) to all these (redundant man's lengths).\n\n10:2:3:1616\\. And they also say, 'When Pra _g_ apati had formed the body he\nfilled it up with these (redundant lengths) wherever there was anything\ndefective in it; and therefore also it is rightly proportioned.'\n\n10:2:3:1717\\. As to this some say, 'The first time they construct a simple\n(altar 3), then the one higher by one (man's length), up to the one of\nunlimited size.' Let him not do so.\n\n10:2:3:1818\\. Sevenfold, indeed, Pra _g_ apati was created in the beginning.\nHe went on constructing (developing) his body, and stopped at the one hundred\nand one-fold one. He who constructs one lower than a sevenfold one cuts this\nFather Pra _g_ apati in twain: he will be the worse for sacrificing as one\nwould be by doing injury to his better. And he who constructs one exceeding\nthe one hundred and one-fold one steps beyond this universe, for Pra _g_ apati\nis this universe. Hence he should first construct the sevenfold (altar), then\nthe next higher up to the one hundred and one-fold one, but he should not\nconstruct one exceeding the one hundred and one-fold\n\np. 313\n\none, and thus, indeed, he neither cuts this Father Pra _g_ apati in twain, nor\ndoes he step beyond this universe.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[306:3](sbe4352.htm#fr_593) That is, measuring seven times the length of a man\nstanding with upstretched arms.\n\n[307:1](sbe4352.htm#fr_594) That is, 'the wife's hall,'--the sacrificial hall\nor shed, usually called Pra _k_ inava _m_ _s_ a or Pragva _m_ _s_ a, measuring\n20 cubits by 10 (part ii, p. 3, note 2), in which the original fires and vedi\nof ish _t_ is are enclosed at the Soma-sacrifice; see the plan, part ii, p.\n475.\n\n[307:2](sbe4352.htm#fr_595) A fathom (vyama) is the space between the tips of\nthe two middle fingers of a man standing with outstretched arms, this being\nconsidered the man's height. In this paragraph, the author roughly\nrecapitulates the main dimensions of the sacrificial ground used for ish _t_\nis, which will also be required for the present purpose. The dimensions here\nsupplied will give about the distance of eight steps between (the centres of)\nthe Garhapatya and \xc3\x82havaniya fires required by I, 7, 3, 23. In the middle of\nthe space of a fathom here alluded to as the easternmost space of the hall,\nthe (original square) \xc3\x82havaniya is laid down, but this ultimately makes way\nfor the new circular Garhapatya hearth built of bricks and having the whole of\nthis 'fathom' for its diameter.\n\n[307:3](sbe4352.htm#fr_596) That is, the hindmost (western) point of the\n(easterly line of the) Mahavedi of the Soma-sacrifice, where the peg, called\n'anta _h_ patya,' is driven in, being three steps east from the post of the\nfront door of the Pra _k_ inava _m_ _s_ a (and hence three steps from the\nfuture circular Garhapatya hearth built of bricks).\n\n[307:4](sbe4352.htm#fr_597) Literally, these are (ten) steps, having the\nfathom as an eleventh (space or step).\n\n[308:1](sbe4352.htm#fr_598) That is, the brick-built Garhapatya of the Agni\n_k_ ayana on which the Ukhya Agni, having been carried about by the Sacrificer\nfor a year, is transferred from the fire-pan (ukha), and from which afterwards\nthe fire of the great altar is derived. This new Garhapatya has been raised on\nthe site of the old (square) \xc3\x82havaniya (the so-called ' _s_ aladvarya' or\nhall-door fire), on which the fire in the pan, the Ukhya Agni, was kindled\n(esha ahavaniyo vakshyama _n_ aya _s_ _k_ ayanamahaveder garhapatyo bhavati;\nSay.). The pan containing this fire was then placed half a fathom south of\n(the centre of) the old \xc3\x82havaniya, and hence so as to stand quite close to the\nbrick-built Garhapatya raised in its place, and forming a circle with a\ndiameter of one fathom. Thus this 'space of a fathom' is here quite correctly\nreferred to as the original source of the fires of the Agni _k_ ayana.\n\n[308:2](sbe4352.htm#fr_599) For the dimensions of the Mahavedi here referred\nto, see part ii, p. 111 seq.\n\n[309:1](sbe4352.htm#fr_600) That is, in the first of these seven persons or\nmen, making up the sacrificial man (ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a-purusha), Pra _g_ apati; that\nfirst man being the Sacrificer himself, as supplying the standard for these\nmeasures.\n\n[309:2](sbe4352.htm#fr_601) That is, the fifth region, situated in a vertical\ndirection, this being represented by the fire-altar which rises upwards.\n\n[309:3](sbe4352.htm#fr_602) Somewhat differently Professor Delbruck, Altind.\nSyntax, p. 444, 'The womb does not grow in proportion with the embryo produced\ntherein.'\n\n[309:4](sbe4352.htm#fr_603) The argument of the author apparently is, that the\nplanned enlargement of the fire-altar is an enlargement of the child Agni,\nafter he has been born, and does not involve an increased size of the original\nsacrificial ground of the Pra _k_ inava _m_ _s_ a.\n\n[310:1](sbe4352.htm#fr_604) That is, of course, the Mahavedi on which the\n(ordinary) fire-altar is raised, and which is enlarged in proportion to the\nsize of the altar. The intermediate sizes of the fire-altar between the two\nextremes here alluded to increase each by four square 'man's lengths' (the man\nbeing measured with upstretched arms), or by one man's length on each side of\nthe body of the altar; the largest possible altar thus measuring 101 man's\nlengths on each side.\n\n[310:2](sbe4352.htm#fr_605) A step, or pace (prakrama) is equal to 3 feet\n(pada), a foot measuring 12 finger-breadths (a\xe1\xb9\x85gula),--these measures being,\nhowever (at least theoretically), relative to the Sacrificer's height.\n\n[310:3](sbe4352.htm#fr_606) That is to say, he stretches the cord along the\nground from the (western) 'end of the Vedi' eastwards, and marks off on the\nground three-sevenths of the cord on the eastern side, that part of the Vedi\nbeing afterwards covered by the brick-built altar, whilst the remaining space\nbehind is required for the Sadas and Havirdhana sheds, &c. If we take the\nMahavedi to be 108 feet long (= 36 prakramas) this would allow 15 3/8 feet for\neach part, or some 46 feet for the length of the part to be covered with\nbricks, and this measure, being equal to seven man's lengths, would allow 6\n4/7 feet for a man's length (including the upstretched arms). Between the\naltar and the front (eastern) edge of the Vedi a space of one foot is,\nhowever, to be left.\n\n[310:4](sbe4352.htm#fr_607) That is, he stretches the cord across (north to\nsouth) and marks off the three central divisions of it as forming the hind\nside of the altar (leaving two-sevenths of the string free on either side).\nThis gives 12 5/7 (out of 90) feet for each part, or 38 4/7 feet for the back,\nor western, side of the altar.\n\n[311:1](sbe4352.htm#fr_608) This gives 10 2/7 (out of 72) feet for each part,\nor 30 6/7 feet for the front, or eastern, side of the altar. The measurements\nhere given are intended as a refinement on the usual square shape of the fire-\naltar.\n\n[312:1](sbe4352.htm#fr_609) Or, from the right total (sampad) which the altar\nought to obtain. By [paragraph 7](sbe4352.htm#10:2:3:7), the altar is to be\nmade fourteen times as large as the sevenfold one; and the latter being said\nto be in exact proportion with Pra _g_ apati (in [paragraph\n3](sbe4352.htm#10:2:3:3)), the larger altar would thus show an excess of\nthirteen man's lengths over the rightly proportioned altar.\n\n[312:2](sbe4352.htm#fr_610) Viz. in [paragraph 5](sbe4352.htm#10:2:3:5).\n\n[312:3](sbe4352.htm#fr_611) That is, one of a single man's length on each\nside.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 2, 4.
