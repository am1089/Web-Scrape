Thereupon the Hot _ri_ , having sat down on the Hot _ri_ 's seat\nwhereon he sits down after being chosen 2,\n\np. 185\n\nurges, and thus urged the Adhvaryu takes the two spoons.\n\n3:8:1:22\\. They then proceed with the \xc3\x82pri (verses). The reason why they\nproceed with the \xc3\x82pris is this. With his whole mind, with his whole self,\nforsooth, he who consecrates himself prepares and endeavours to prepare the\nsacrifice. His self is, as it were, emptied out; with those \xc3\x82pris they fill it\nagain; and because they fill 1 it therewith, therefore they are called \xc3\x82pri.\nFor this reason they proceed with the \xc3\x82pris.\n\n3:8:1:33\\. Now there are here eleven fore-offerings; for here in man there are\nten vital airs, and the eleventh is the self wherein those vital airs are\ncontained; this is the whole man; thus they fill his whole self, and therefore\nthere are eleven fore-offerings.\n\n3:8:1:44\\. [The Adhvaryu] having called (on the \xc3\x82gnidhra) for the _S_ rausha\n_t_ , he says (to the Maitravaru _n_ a), 'Prompt (the Hot _ri_ to recite to)\nthe kindling-sticks 2!' Thus he proceeds with ten fore-offerings,\n\np. 186\n\nsaying, 'Prompt . . .' at each, and pouring the ghee together at every fourth\nfore-offering 1. Having performed ten fore-offerings, he says, 'Bring the\nslayer!' 'Slayer,' namely, the (butcher's) knife is called.\n\n3:8:1:55\\. He then takes the (svaru) chip of the sacrificial stake, and having\nanointed both (the slaughtering-knife and the chip) at the top (with ghee)\nfrom the guhu-spoon, he touches the forehead of the victim with them, saying\n(Va _g_. S. VI, 11), 'Anointed with ghee, protect ye the animals!' for the\nchip of the stake is a thunderbolt, and the slaughtering-knife is a\nthunderbolt, and ghee is a thunderbolt; having thus fitted together the entire\nthunderbolt 2 he appoints it the keeper of this (victim), lest the evil\nspirits should injure it. He again conceals the chip of the stake (under the\ngirding-rope of the stake). In handing the slaughtering-knife to the butcher,\nhe says, 'Be this thine approved edge!' and deposits the two spoons.\n\n3:8:1:66\\. Thereupon he says (to the Hot _ri_ ), 'Recite to Agni circumambient\n3!' Having taken a firebrand,\n\np. 187\n\nthe Agnidh carries the fire round (the victim). Why he carries the fire round,\nis that he encircles it (the victim) by means of the fire with an unbroken\nfence, lest the evil spirits should seize upon it; for Agni is the repeller of\nthe Rakshas; therefore he carries the fire round. He carries it round the\nplace where they cook it (the victim 1).\n\n3:8:1:77\\. As to this they say, 'Let him take back that firebrand (to the\n\xc3\x82havaniya); and having there (at the _S_ amitra) churned out a new fire, let\nthem cook it (the victim) thereon. For this (firebrand), surely, is ahavaniya\n(fit to offer upon); it is not for the purpose that they should cook uncooked\n(food) thereon, but for this that they should sacrifice cooked (food)\nthereon.'\n\n3:8:1:88\\. Let him, however, not do this. For in that he carries fire round\nit, it (the victim) becomes as food swallowed by that (firebrand), and it\nwould be as if he were to seize and tear out food that has been swallowed and\noffer it to some one else; let them, therefore, crumble some coals off that\nsame firebrand, and thereon cook that (victim).\n\n3:8:1:99\\. Thereupon the Agnidh, taking a (new) firebrand, walks in front:\nwhereby he places Agni in front, thinking, 'Agni shall repel the evil spirits\nin front!' and\n\np. 188\n\nthey lead the victim after him (to the slaughtering-place) on a (way) free\nfrom danger and injury. The Pratiprasthat _ri_ holds on to it from behind by\nmeans of the two spits 1, and the Adhvaryu (holds on to) the Pratiprasthat\n_ri_ , and the Sacrificer to the Adhvaryu.\n\n3:8:1:1010\\. As to this they say, 'That (victim) must not be held on to by the\nsacrificer, for they lead it unto death; therefore let him not hold on to it.'\nBut let him nevertheless hold on to it; for that (victim) which they lead to\nthe sacrifice they lead not to death; therefore let him hold on to it.\nMoreover he would cut himself off from the sacrifice, were he not to hold on\nto it; therefore let him hold on to it. It is held on to in a mysterious way;\nby means of the spits the Pratiprasthat _ri_ (holds on to it); to the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ the Adhvaryu, to the Adhvaryu the Sacrificer; thus then it\nis held on to in a mysterious way.\n\n3:8:1:1111\\. Thereupon the Adhvaryu takes two stalks of grass from the covered\naltar, and having called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says (to the Maitravaru\n_n_ a), 'O Hot _ri_ , prompt again (the Hot _ri_ to recite for) the offerings\nto the gods 2!' This is what belongs to the All-gods at the animal offering.\n\n3:8:1:1212\\. He then makes (the Sacrificer) say the text (Va _g_. S. VI, 11),\n'O thou prosperous! upon\n\np. 189\n\nthe Sacrificer,'--the prosperous one, forsooth, is Speech, it is because she\nspeaks much, that Speech is prosperous,--'bestow thou what is agreeable unto\nhim! Approach thou,'--thereby he means to say, 'Approach thou an existence\nfree from affliction,'--'from the wide air, along with the divine wind;' for\nthe Rakshas moves about the air rootless and unfettered on both sides, even as\nman here moves about the air rootless and unfettered on both sides: he means\nto say, 'Meeting together with the wind, protect thou this one from the wide\nair,' when he says 'from the wide air, along with the divine wind.'\n\n3:8:1:1313\\. 'Offer thou with the self of this oblation!' whereby he means to\nsay to Speech, 'Offer thou with the soul of this unblemished\noblation;'--'Unite thou with its body!' whereby he means to say to Speech,\n'Unite thou with the body of this unblemished oblation!'\n\n3:8:1:1414\\. In front 1 of the place where they cut it up, he throws down a\nstalk of grass, with, 'O great one, lead the lord of sacrifice unto greater\nsacrifice!' he thus strews barhis (an underlayer of sacrificial grass) for it,\nthat no sacrificial food may be spilt; whatever may now be spilt of it when it\nis cut up, that settles thereon and thus is not lost.\n\n3:8:1:1515\\. They then step back (to the altar) and sit down turning towards\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya, 'lest they should be eye-witnesses to its being quieted\n(strangled).' They do not slay it on the frontal bone 2, for that is human\n\np. 190\n\nmanner; nor behind the ear, for that is after the manner of the Fathers. They\neither choke it by merely keeping its mouth closed, or they make a noose.\nTherefore he says not, 'Slay! kill!' for that is human manner, but, 'Quiet it!\nIt has passed away!' for that is after the manner of the gods. For when he\nsays, 'It has passed away,' then this one (the Sacrificer) passes away to the\ngods: therefore he says, 'It has passed away.'\n\n3:8:1:1616\\. When they hold it down, then, before the strangling, he offers\nwith 'Hail, to the gods!' And when (the butcher) says, 'Quieted is the\nvictim,' he offers with, 'To the gods, Hail!' Thus some of the gods are\npreceded by 'Hail,' and others followed by 'Hail;' he thereby gratifies them,\nand thus gratified both kinds of gods convey him to the heavenly world. These\nare the so-called 'paripa _s_ avya 1' oblations; he may offer them if he\nchoose; or, if he choose, he need not mind them.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[184:2](sbe2631.htm#fr_466) Viz. at the north-west corner (or left hip) of the\naltar. For the formulas used by him, see I, 5, 1, 24-2, 1.\n\n[185:1](sbe2631.htm#fr_467) The text has only 'apyayayanti,' but the verb with\nwhich the author connects the verb 'apri' is either a-p _ri_ _n_ ati, he\nfills; or (more correctly) 'a-pri _n_ ati,' he gratifies, propitiates,\ncorresponding to the Zand afrinaiti. Perhaps some words have been lost here.\nThe Ka _n_ va text has: sa yad etabhir apribhi _h_ punar apyayata etabhir enam\napri _n_ ati tasmad apriyo nama. On the \xc3\x82pri verses, which form the offering-\nprayers (ya _g_ yas) at the fore-offerings of the animal sacrifice, and vary\naccording to different families, see Ait. Br. II, 4; Max Muller, Hist. of A.\nS. L., p. 463 seq.; Haug, Essays, p. 24r.\n\n[185:2](sbe2631.htm#fr_468) See I, 5, 3, 8. The Adhvaryu calls out to the\nAgnidh, 'O _s_ ravaya (make listen)!' The Agnidh calls out, 'Astu _s_ rausha\n_t_ (yea, may one hear)!' The Adhvaryu calls on the Maitravaru _n_ a, 'Preshya\nsamidha _h_ (prompt as to the kindling-sticks)!' [or, 'Preshya Tanunapatam or\nNara _s_ a _m_ sam' &c. in the succeeding fore-offerings.] The Maitravaru _n_\na calls out, 'Hota yakshat samidham [Tanunapatam, &c.], (let the Hot _ri_\npronounce the offering-prayer to the kindling-sticks, &c,!)' Each offering-\nprayer (\xc3\x82pri) is introduced p. 186 with the formula 'Ye ya _g_ amahe, &c.' See\npart i, p.148 note. The divine objects of these oblations of ghee are: 1. the\nSamidhs or kindling-sticks; 2. either Tanunapat or Nara _s_ a _m_ sa; 3. the I\n_d_ as; 4. the Barhis (sacrificial grass on the altar); 5. the gates (of\nheaven and worshipping ground); 6. Dawn and Night; 7. the two divine Hot _ri_\ns; 8. the three goddesses (Sarasvati, I _d_ a, and Bharati); 9. Tvash _t_ _ri_\n; 10. Vanaspati (the tree, or lord of the forest); 11. the Svahak _ri_ tis\n(calls of 'All-hail,' which at this, the last offering-prayer, are repeated\nbefore the names of the principal deities of the sacrifice). For this last\nfore-offering, see [III, 8, 2, 23](sbe2632.htm#3:8:2:23) seq.\n\n[186:1](sbe2631.htm#fr_469) See I, 5, 3, 16.\n\n[186:2](sbe2631.htm#fr_470) For the three parts of the thunderbolt, see [p.\n108](sbe2618.htm#page_108), note [2](sbe2618.htm#fn_285).\n\n[186:3](sbe2631.htm#fr_471) The Hot _ri_ recites the triplet, Rig-veda IV, 15,\n1-3.\n\n[187:1](sbe2631.htm#fr_472) Saya _n_ a seems to take 'abhipariharati' in the\nsense of 'he takes it round to the place where they cook.' According to Katy.\nVI, 5, 2, 3, the Agnidh circumambulates thrice from left to right, either the\nplace comprising the victim, the ghee, the slaughtering-place, the sacrificial\npost, the _k_ atvala, and \xc3\x82havaniya; or only the ghee, the victim, and\nslaughtering-place. He then throws the firebrand back on the \xc3\x82havaniya, and\nperforms the circumambulation as many times in the opposite direction. On the\nParyagnikara _n_ a, see also part i, p. 45 note.\n\n[188:1](sbe2631.htm#fr_473) For the two omentum-spits, see note on [III, 8, 2,\n16](sbe2632.htm#3:8:2:16).\n\n[188:2](sbe2631.htm#fr_474) The Maitravaru _n_ a's additional cue or order\n(upapraisha) is 'Agni has been victorious; he has won wealth!' On the Hot _ri_\n's recitation--the so-called Adhrigu litany--commencing 'Ye divine quieters\n(slaughterers), commence, as well as ye that are human!' and consisting of\nformulas usually pronounced by the Adhvaryu (and hence perhaps going back to a\ntime when the Hot _ri_ had to perform all but the menial parts of the\nsacrificial service), see Ait. Br. II, 6-7; Roth, Yaska XXXVII seq.\n\n[189:1](sbe2631.htm#fr_475) According to Katy. VI, 5, 15, the stalk is put\ndown behind the _S_ amitra (i.e. the fire at the slaughtering-place) with the\ntop towards the east.\n\n[189:2](sbe2631.htm#fr_476) Lit. 'by means of the frontal bone.' Saya _n_ a\nexplains it by 'in p. 190 seizing it by the horn;' Professor Weber, Ind. Stud.\nIX, p. 222, 'by striking it with a horn.' The Ka _n_ va text reads, tasya na\nku _t_ ena praghnanti manusha _m_ ha kuryad yad asya ku _t_ ena prahanyu _h_.\n\n[190:1](sbe2631.htm#fr_477) That is, surrounding, relating to, the victim.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 8, 2.
