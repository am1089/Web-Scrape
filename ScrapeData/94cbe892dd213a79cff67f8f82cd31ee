Being about to perform the patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as 1, they betake\nthemselves back to the Garhapatya fire. The Adhvaryu takes the _g_ uhu and\nsruva, the Hot _ri_ the veda, and the \xc3\x82gnidhra the butter-(melting) pot.\n\n1:9:2:22\\. Here now the Adhvaryu, according to some, passes the \xc3\x82havaniya on\nthe east side. Let him not, however, do this; for were he to walk on that\nside, he would be outside the sacrifice.\n\n1:9:2:33\\. According to others, the Adhvaryu walks (so as to pass) behind the\n(sacrificer\'s) wife 2. Let him not, however, do this either; for verily the\nAdhvaryu is the fore-part, and the wife is the hind-part of the sacrifice:\nhence, if he were to pass so, it would be as if one were to put his head\nbehind; and he (the Adhvaryu) would be outside the sacrifice.\n\np. 257\n\n1:9:2:44\\. According to others, the Adhvaryu passes between the wife (and the\nGarhapatya fire). Let him not, however, do this either; for were he to pass\nthat way, he would cut off the wife from the sacrifice. Along the east side of\nthe Garhapatya and the inner side of the \xc3\x82havaniya (he passes); for thus he is\nnot outside the sacrifice; and as before, in walking forward (to the\n\xc3\x82havaniya), he passed along the inner side, so he now also takes that path.\n\n1:9:2:55\\. They now perform the patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as. From the sacrifice\noffspring is assuredly produced; and (that offspring) produced from the\nsacrifice is produced from union; and (the offspring) produced from union is\nproduced after (in consequence of) the completion 1 of the sacrifice: hence\none thereby (i.e. by the patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as) causes that (offspring) to be\nproduced by means of a productive union after the completion of the sacrifice.\nAnd so now also offspring is produced by means of a productive union after the\ncompletion of the sacrifice. This is why they now perform the patnisa _m_ ya\n_g_ as.\n\n1:9:2:66\\. He makes offering to four deities. Four doubtless means a couple;\nfor a couple means a pair (dvandva, lit. two and two), and two and two indeed\nthey are: thus a productive union is thereby effected; and accordingly he\nmakes offering to four deities.\n\n1:9:2:77\\. He makes (the offerings) of butter for sacrificial food. Butter\nindeed means seed: hence he thereby scatters seed, and therefore makes them of\nbutter for sacrificial food.\n\np. 258\n\n1:9:2:88\\. In a low voice they engage in this (performance) 1. Secretly,\ndoubtless, union takes place; and secretly also (takes place) what (is spoken)\nin a low voice: this is why they perform in a low voice.\n\n1:9:2:99\\. He first makes offering to Soma. Soma indeed means seed; hence he\nthereby scatters seed: this is why he makes offering to Soma.\n\n1:9:2:1010\\. He then makes offering to Tvash _t_ _ri_. Now, it is Tvash _t_\n_ri_ who transforms seed which is scattered. Accordingly it is he who\ntransforms the seed now scattered 2: this is why he makes offering to Tvash\n_t_ _ri_.\n\n1:9:2:1111\\. He then makes offering to the wives of the gods. In the wives, in\nthe womb, the seed assuredly is planted, and thence it is produced; hence he\nthereby plants the seed in the wives, in the womb; and thence it is produced:\nfor this reason he makes offering to the wives of the gods.\n\n1:9:2:1212\\. When he offers to the wives of the gods, he shuts (the fire) out\nfrom view on the eastern side; for, up to the time when they offer to the\nsamish _t_ aya _g_ us, the deities continue waiting, thinking, \'This\n\np. 259\n\nhe must offer up to us!\' He thereby conceals (this offering) from them; and\naccordingly Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya says, \'Whenever human women here eat 1 (they do\nso) apart from men.\'\n\n1:9:2:1313\\. He then makes offering to Agni, the householder. Agni, indeed, is\nthis world: hence it is for this world that he thereby produces offspring and\nthat this offspring is produced: this is why he makes offering to Agni, the\nhouseholder.\n\n1:9:2:1414\\. This (ceremony) concludes with the i _d_ a 2; for here are\nneither enclosing-sticks nor the prastara-bunch. For on that occasion when he\nwishes the sacrificer good-speed (svaga) 3 by (offering) the prastara, good-\nspeed is at the same time wished to his consort also, since the wife comes\n(immediately) after the husband. But were he to use a substitute for the\nprastara-bunch, he would produce lassitude (in the wife): for this reason this\n(ceremony) should conclude with the i _d_ a. Nevertheless a substitute for the\nprastara is (optionally) made.\n\n1:9:2:1515\\. If he choose to use a substitute for the prastara, he thereby\nwishes the wife good-speed just as\n\np. 260\n\nhe wishes the sacrificer good-speed by means of the prastara.\n\n1:9:2:1616\\. If he choose to use a substitute for the prastara, he plucks out\none stalk from the veda, and anoints its top in the _g_ uhu, its middle part\nin the aruva, and its lower end in the butter-pan.\n\n1:9:2:1717\\. The \xc3\x82gnidhra then says, \'Throw (it) after 1!\' [The Adhvaryu]\nhaving thrown it silently after (the prastara into the fire), touches himself,\nwith the text (Va _g_. S. II, 16 f), \'Guardian of the eye art thou, O Agni,\nguard mine eye!\' and in this way he avoids throwing himself after (the\nprastara into the fire).\n\n1:9:2:1818\\. He (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) then says (to the Adhvaryu), \'Discourse\ntogether!\' (The Adhvaryu says), \'Has he gone (to the gods), Agnidh?\' \'He has\ngone!\' \'Bid (the gods) hear!\' \'May (one or they) hear!\' \'Good-speed to the\ndivine Hot _ri_ s! Success to the human!\' [Then the Adhvaryu to the Hot _ri_\n], \'Pronounce the "All-hail and blessing!"\'\n\n1:9:2:1919\\. Thereupon 2 he (the Adhvaryu) seizes at the same time the _g_ uhu\nand sruva. On the former occasion 3 indeed, by anointing (the prastara), he\n\np. 261\n\nmade (the sacrificer) an oblation, thus thinking, \'May he go to the world of\nthe gods as an oblation!\' For this reason he now seizes the _g_ uhu and sruva\nat the same time.\n\n1:9:2:2020\\. He seizes them for Agni, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 20 a), \'O\nAgni, unimpaired in vigour, far-reacher!\' because Agni is immortal, he says,\nunimpaired in vigour:\' and because Agni is farthest-reaching, he says, \'far-\nreacher 1.\'--\'Guard me from the thunderbolt! guard me from bonds! guard me\nfrom defective sacrifice! guard me from noxious food!\' he thereby says,\n\'Protect me from all kinds of injury!\'--\'Make our nourishment free from\npoison!\'--nourishment means food: \'make our food wholesome, faultless!\' this\nis what he thereby says.--\'In the lap, pleasant to sit in;\' he thereby says,\n\'in thyself.\'--\'Svaha! Va _t_!\' since one offers what has been consecrated by\nvasha _t_ ,\' this (residue of butter) thereby becomes such for him.\n\n1:9:2:2121\\. The mistress then unties the veda-bunch. The altar (vedi)\nassuredly is female and the veda is male. For union the veda was made: and\naccordingly when he touches, (the altar) with it during the sacrifice, a union\nproductive of offspring is thereby effected.\n\n1:9:2:2222\\. And (the reason) why it is the mistress who unties the veda (is\nthis): the mistress is female and the veda is male; consequently a union\nproductive of offspring is thereby effected: this is why the mistress unties\nthe veda.\n\n1:9:2:2323\\. She unties it. Should she wish to do so\n\np. 262\n\nwith a Ya _g_ us-text, let her do so with this one (Va _g_. S. II, 21 a), \'The\nVeda art thou: whereby thou, O divine Veda, hast become Veda for the gods,\nthereby mayest thou become Veda for me 1!\'\n\n1:9:2:2424\\. (The Hot _ri_ ) strews it (from the Garhapatya) as far as (the\neast end of) the altar 2; for the altar is female and the veda is male; and\nfrom behind the male approaches the female: from behind (i.e. west) he\naccordingly causes it (the altar) to be approached by that male, the veda. For\nthis reason he strews (the grass of the veda) as far as (the east end of) the\naltar.\n\n#### CONCLUDING CEREMONIES.\n\n1:9:2:2525\\. He (the Adhvaryu) now makes the samish _t_ aya _g_ us-oblation,\nthinking, \'In the east my sacrifice shall be completed!\' Were he to perform\nthe samish _t_ aya _g_ us-oblation first and then the patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as,\nthat sacrifice of his would be completed in the west (behind the sacrificer)\n3: hence he makes\n\np. 263\n\nthe samish _t_ aya _g_ us-oblation at this particular time, thinking, \'In the\neast my sacrifice shall be completed!\'\n\n1:9:2:2626\\. Now as to why it is called samish _t_ aya _g_ us 1: whatever\ndeities he invites through this (new or full-moon) sacrifice, and for\nwhichever deities this sacrifice is performed, all those are thereby\n\'sacrificed to together\' (sam-ish _t_ a); and because he now makes a (butter)\noblation 2 to all those deities, who have been \'sacrificed to together,\'\ntherefore this (oblation) is called samish _t_ aya _g_ us.\n\n1:9:2:2727\\. And again as to why he performs the samish _t_ aya _g_ us:\nwhatever deities he invites through this sacrifice, and for whichever deities\nthis sacrifice is performed, they continue waiting until the samish _t_ aya\n_g_ us is performed, thinking, \'This he must offer to us!\' These same\n(deities) he thereby dismisses in due form; and whatever be the practice in\ntheir case in accordance with that he has, in thus performing it, produced the\nsacrifice, and having thus produced it he now establishes it safely where\nthere is a safe basis for it: this is why he performs the samish _t_ aya _g_\nus.\n\n1:9:2:2828\\. He makes the offering, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 21 b), \'Ye\npath-finding gods,\'--for the gods\n\np. 264\n\nare indeed the finders of the path 1;--\'Having found the path--,\' thereby he\nsays, \'having found the sacrifice;\'--\'Walk in the path!\' thereby he dismisses\nthem in due form;--\'O divine Lord of mind, this sacrifice--Svaha!--give to the\nwind!\' for the sacrifice, indeed, is that blowing one (the wind). Having\naccordingly prepared this (special) sacrifice, he thereby establishes it\nsafely in that (chief, full or new-moon) sacrifice, and thus unites sacrifice\nwith sacrifice: for this reason he says, \'Svaha! give (it) to the wind!\'\n\n1:9:2:2929\\. He then offers up the barhis, The barhis, truly, is this world,\nand the barhis (consists of) plants: hence he thereby bestows plants on this\nworld, and these plants are safely established in this world: for this reason\nhe offers up the barhis.\n\n1:9:2:3030\\. This offering he makes as an additional one, since the samish _t_\naya _g_ us is the end of the sacrifice, and consequently what comes after the\nsamish _t_ aya _g_ us is additional; and because, in performing the samish _t_\naya _g_ us, he offers to those (deities 2), and thence additional unlimited\nplants are here produced.\n\n1:9:2:3131\\. He offers it, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 22), \'May the barhis\ncombine with the sacrificial food, with the butter! May Indra combine with the\n\xc3\x82dityas, the Vasus, the Maruts, and the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_! May what (has been\noffered with) "Svaha" go up to the heavenly ether 3!\'\n\n1:9:2:3232\\. Having thereupon walked round (from the\n\np. 265\n\nnorth side of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire) to the south, he pours the pra _n_ ita-water\n1 out (on the altar). Now, when he spreads the sacrifice, he yokes it. But\nwere he not to pour out (the pra _n_ ita-water), the sacrifice, being unyoked,\nwould, in moving backward, injure the sacrificer. In this way, however, the\nsacrifice does not injure the sacrificer; and for this reason he pours out the\npra _n_ ita-water, after walking round to the south.\n\n1:9:2:3333\\. He pours it out, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 23 a), \'Who 2\nunyokes thee? He unyokes thee! For whom does he unyoke thee? For him he\nunyokes thee! For plenty!\' He thereby announces to the sacrificer the highest\nprosperity. He pours it out with the same (vessel) with which he brings it\nforward; for wherewith they yoke the team, therewith they also unyoke it; with\nthe yoke-tie they yoke it, and with the yoke-tie they unyoke it. By means of a\npotsherd he now throws the refuse from the cleaning of the rice 3 right under\nthe black antelope skin; with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 23 b), \'The Rakshas\'\nshare art thou!\'\n\n1:9:2:3434\\. Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_\napati, were contending about this sacrifice, (that is, their) father Pra _g_\napati, the year. \'Ours it (he) shall be! ours it shall be,\' they said.\n\n1:9:2:3535\\. Thereupon the gods obtained possession of the whole of the\nsacrifice, and dispossessed those\n\np. 266\n\n[paragraph continues] (Asuras) of it by (giving them) what was the worst part\nof the sacrifice, to wit, with the blood of the victim (they dispossessed\nthem) of the animal sacrifice, and with the refuse of the rice of the havirya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a. \'May they be duly dispossessed of the sacrifice,\' they thought for\nhe indeed is duly dispossessed, who is dispossessed even while obtaining a\n(worthless) share. He, on the other hand, who is dispossessed without any\nshare whatever, hopes for a while, and when it occurs to him, he says, \'What\nshare hast thou given me?\' Hence what share the gods set apart for those\n(Asuras), that same share he now makes over to them in pouring (the refuse of\nthe rice) right under the black antelope skin. He thereby casts it into blind\ndarkness, where there is no (sacrificial) fire. And in the same way he casts\nthe blood of the victim into blind darkness, where there is no fire; thinking,\n\'Thou art the Rakshas\' share!\' For this reason they use not the gore of the\nvictim (for sacrificial purposes), since it is the Rakshas\' share.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[256:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_602) The meaning of the term seems to be \'offerings\nmade (to some deities) along with the wives (of the gods);\' the deities to\nwhom the four offerings are made, being Soma, Tvash _t_ _ri_ , the Devapatnya\n_h_ (wives of the gods), and Agni G _ri_ hapati.\n\n[256:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_603) The lady of the house occupies a seat south-west\nof the Garhapatya fire. See I, 3, 1, 12. The Adhvaryu now sits down with\nraised knees (south of her, with his face to the north-east). Katy. III, 7, 5.\nThe \xc3\x82gnidhra sits down in the same way north of the fire, with his face to the\nsouth, and the Hot _ri_ in the middle; cf. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollm. p.\n151.\n\n[257:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_604) Or, \'is produced from the hind-part of the\nsacrifice,\' i.e. from the sacrificer\'s wife, seated behind the altar, see par.\n3.\n\n[258:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_605) The Adhvaryu calls on the Hot _ri_ : \'For Soma\n(Tvash _t_ _ri_ , &c. respectively)\' (in a low voice)--\'recite!\' (aloud). The\nHot _ri_ then recites the invitatory prayer (anuvakya, for which see \xc3\x82 _s_ v.\n_S_ r. I, 10, 5) in a low voice, except the concluding \'om!\' which he\npronounces aloud. The Adhvaryu now calls on the \xc3\x82gnidhra, who responds with\n\'Astu _s_ rausha _t_.\' Thereupon the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot _ri_ ; \'For\nSoma,\' &c. (in a low voice),--\'pronounce the offering prayer!\' (aloud); and\nthe Hot _ri_ recites the ya _g_ ya, in a low voice, except the concluding\n\'Vausha _t_ ,\' which is pronounced aloud, and simultaneously with which the\nAdhvaryu pours the oblation (consisting of four ladlings of butter from the\nbutter-pot into the _g_ uhu, by means of the sruva) into the fire.\n\n[258:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_606) He does so in his capacity of divine artificer and\narchitect.\n\n[259:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_607) _G_ ighatsanti, \'eat greedily, swallow their\nfood.\' The Ka _n_ va text does not mention Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, but merely\nsays, \'hence women also here swallow their food apart from men.\'\n\n[259:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_608) The i _d_ a-ceremony (I, 8, 1, 18) is repeated\nafter the patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as, together with the _S_ a _m_ yuvaka and the\noffering of remains, but with special reference to the mistress of the house.\nSince the prastara-bunch and the enclosing-sticks have already been consumed\nby the fire, the Suktavaka is omitted on the present occasion; the Adhvaryu\nmerely throwing a stalk of the reed-grass of the veda into the fire, as a\nsubstitute for the stalk of the prastara (representing the sacrificer).\n\n[259:3](sbe1238.htm#fr_609) See I, 8, 3, 11 seq.\n\n[260:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_610) See I, 8, 3, 19 seq.\n\n[260:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_611) That is, after the Hot _ri_ has again recited the\nSa _m_ yuvaka, in the same way as above, I, 9, I, 26-29.\n\n[260:3](sbe1238.htm#fr_612) Viz. at the offering of the remains of butter (I,\n8, 3, 23), of which the present ceremony is the counterpart. Dr. Hillebrandt,\nNeu- and Vollm. p. 160, (after a scholiast) calls this modification Pragraha-\nhoma (offered to Agni adabdhayu a _s_ itama). According to Katy. III, 7, 18;\n19, this ceremony is followed by the performance, in the Dakshi _n_ a fire, of\ntwo ( _g_ uhoti) oblations of butter, to Agni sa _m_ ve _s_ apati and\nSarasvati respectively (see the formulas Va _g_. S. II, 20, b, c); and the\npish _t_ alepa-ahuti to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ , being an offering of the\nremnants of dough, left from the preparation of the sacrificial cakes. These\nofferings would then be succeeded by the ceremonies treated in par. 22 seq.\n\n[261:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_613) Harisvamin derives a _s_ itama and a _s_ ish _th_\na from a _s_ , \'to eat\' (instead of from a _s_ , \'to reach, penetrate\'), hence\n\'the greatest eater.\' Mahidhara gives both derivations.\n\n[262:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_614) According to Katy. III, 8, 2, the lady thereupon\nunties the grass-cord with which she was girt (see I, 3, 1, 12), with the\ntext, \'I free myself from Varu _n_ a\'s noose wherewith the gracious Savit _ri_\nbound me; place me unscathed, together with my husband, in the lap of eternal\nlaw, in the world of righteousness!\' \xc3\x82 _s_ v. I, 11, 3, however, assigns this\nceremony to the Hot _ri_ ; and no doubt rightly, since it is not mentioned by\nour author, and the Va _g_. S. does not give the formula. Thereby also the\noriginal form of the text (Rig-veda X, 85, 24), \'I free thee,\' &c., is\npreserved. Mahidhara on Va _g_. S. here takes \'veda\' either in the sense of\n\'the Veda ( _Ri_ k, &c.),\' or as \'the knower.\' Perhaps it should rather be\ntaken as \'the obtainer.\'\n\n[262:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_615) Thus a vede _h_ is explained by Harisvamin\n(according to comm. on Katy. III, 8, 3). Others take it in the sense of \'up to\nwhere the barhis begins.\'\n\n[262:3](sbe1238.htm#fr_616) The patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as were performed in the\nGarhapatya fire, and therefore west of the altar; and on their completion, the\npriests betake themselves back to the \xc3\x82havaniya.\n\n[263:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_617) The real original meaning of the term would rather\nseem to have been \'the formula marking the completion of the sacrifice,\' it\nhaving afterwards come to be applied to the oblation (to the wind-god) itself.\nCf. par. 30 and Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 232,\n\n[263:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_618) Or rather, \'because to all those deities to whom\nan ish _t_ i (or ya _g_ ati-offering, made by the Adhvaryu standing south of\nthe altar; and followed or accompanied by the vasha _t_ -call) has been\noffered in common, he now makes an ahuti (or _g_ uhoti-offering, made by him\nwhilst standing north of the altar, with the svaha-call).\'\n\n[264:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_619) Mahidhara refers gatu-vida _h_ and vittva to vid,\n\'to know.\'\n\n[264:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_620) According to Harisvamin, he does so, since that\noffering is made for the sake of dismissing (satisfying) the deities.\n\n[264:3](sbe1238.htm#fr_621) Mahidhara interprets, \'May Indra--together with\nthe \xc3\x82dityas, the Vasus, the Maruts, and the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ \\--anoint the\nbarhis thoroughly with the havis-like ghee,\' &c.\n\n[265:1](sbe1238.htm#fr_622) See [p. 9](sbe1203.htm#page_9), note\n[1](sbe1203.htm#fn_94).\n\n[265:2](sbe1238.htm#fr_623) Or, Pra _g_ apati . . ., see I, 1, 1, 13, with\nnote.\n\n[265:3](sbe1238.htm#fr_624) See I, 1, 4, 23-24. According to the Paddhati on\nKaty. III, 8, the Adhvaryu holds the deer-skin with his left hand over the\nutkara, or heap of rubbish, and pours the refuse under the skin on the utkara.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 9, 3.
