'O lord, this barge ascend,  \nAnd with thy princely followers bend  \nTo yonder side thy prosperous way  \nWith naught to check thee or delay.'  \n\nNor did the saint their rede reject:  \nHe bade farewell with due respect,  \nAnd crossed, attended by the twain,  \nThat river rushing to the main.  \nWhen now the bark was half way o'er,  \nRama and Lakshman heard the roar,  \n\nThat louder grew and louder yet,  \nOf waves by dashing waters met.  \nThen Rama asked the mighty seer:  \n'What is the tumult that I hear  \nOf waters cleft in mid career?'  \nSoon as the speech of Rama, stirred  \nBy deep desire to know, he heard,  \nThe pious saint began to tell  \nWhat paused the waters' roar and swell:  \n'On high Kailasa's distant hill  \n   There lies a noble lake  \nWhose waters, born from Brahma's will,  \n   The name of Manas 1b take.  \nThence, hallowing where'er they flow,  \n   The streams of Sarju fall,  \nAnd wandering through the plains below  \n   Embrace Ayodhya's wall.  \nStill, still preserved in Sarju's name  \n   Sarovar's 2b fame we trace.  \nThe flood of Brahma whence she came  \n   To run her holy race.  \nTo meet great Ganga here she hies  \n   With tributary wave:  \nHence the loud roar ye hear arise,  \n   Of floods that swell and rave.  \nHere, pride of Raghu's line, do thou  \nIn humble adoration bow.'  \n\nHe spoke. The princes both obeyed,  \nAnd reverence to each river paid. 3b  \nThey reached the southern shore at last,  \nAnd gaily on their journey passed.  \nA little space beyond there stood  \nA gloomy awe-inspiring wood.  \nThe monarch's noble son began  \nTo question thus the holy man:  \n'Whose gloomy forest meets mine eye  \nLike some vast cloud that fills the sky?  \nPathless and dark it seems to be,  \nWhere birds in thousands wander free;  \nWhere shrill cicadas' cries resound,  \n\np. 39  \n\nAnd fowl of dismal note abound,  \nLion, rhinoceros, and bear,  \nBoar, tiger, elephant, are there,  \n   There shrubs and thorns run wild:  \nDhao, Sal, Bignonia, Bel, 1 are found,  \nAnd every tree that grows on ground.  \n   How is the forest styled?'  \nThe glorious saint this answer made:  \n   'Dear child of Raghu, hear  \nWho dwells within the horrid shade  \n   That looks so dark and drear.  \nWhere now is wood, long ere this day  \n   Two broad and fertile lands,  \nMalaja and Karusha lay.  \n   Adorned by heavenly hands.  \nHere, mourning friendship's broken ties,  \nLord Indra of the thousand eyes  \nHungered and sorrowed many a day,  \nHis brightness soiled with mud and clay,  \nWhen in a storm of passion he  \nHad slain his dear friend Namuchi.  \nThen came the Gods and saints who bore  \nTheir golden pitchers brimming o'er  \nWith holy streams that banish stain,  \nAnd bathed Lord Indra pure again.  \nWhen in this land the God was freed  \nFrom spot and stain of impious deed  \nFor that his own dear friend he slew,  \nHigh transport thrilled his bosom through.  \nThen in his joy the lands he blessed,  \nAnd gave a boon they long possessed:  \n'Because these fertile lands retain  \nThe washings of the blot and stain,'  \n   'Twas thus Lord Indra sware,  \n'Malaja and Karusha's name  \nShall celebrate with deathless fame  \n   My malady and care.' 2  \n'So be it', all the Immortals cried,  \n   When Indra's speech they heard,  \nAnd with acclaim they ratified  \n   The names his lips conferred.  \nLong time, O victor of thy foes,  \nThese happy lands had sweet repose,  \nAnd higher still in fortune rose.  \nAt length a spirit, loving ill,  \nTadaka , wearing shapes at will,  \n\nWhose mighty strength, exceeding vast  \nA thousand elephants, surpassed,  \nWas to fierce Sunda, lord and head  \nOf all the demon armies, wed.  \nFrom her, Lord Indra's peer in might  \nGiant Maricha sprang to light:  \nAnd she, a constant plague and pest,  \nThese two fair realms has long distressed.  \nNow dwelling in her dark abode  \nA league away she bars the road:  \nAnd we, O Rama, hence must go  \nWhere lies the forest of the foe.  \nNow on thine own right arm rely,  \n   And my command obey:  \nSmite the foul monster that she die.  \n   And take the plague away.  \nTo reach this country none may dare  \n   Fallen from its old estate,  \nWhich she, whose fury naught can bear,  \n   Has left so desolate.  \nAnd now my truthful tale is told  \n   How with accursed sway  \nThe spirit plagued this wood of old,  \n   And ceases not to-day.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[38:1](ry027.htm#fr_156) _The Bodiless one._\n\n[38:1b](ry028.htm#fr_157) 'A celebrated lake regarded in India as sacred. It\nlies in the lofty region between the northern highlands of the Himalayas and\nmount Kailasa, the region of the sacred lakes. The poem, following the popular\nIndian belief, makes the river Sarayu (now Sarju) flow from the Manasa lake;\nthe sources of the river are a little to the south about a day's journey from\nthe lake. See Lassen, _Indische Alterthumsbunde_ , page 34.' GORBESIO. _Manas_\nmeans mind; _m anasa_, mental, mind-born.\n\n[38:2b](ry028.htm#fr_158) _Sarovar_ means best of lakes. This is another of\nthe poet's fanciful etymologies.\n\n[38:3b](ry028.htm#fr_159) The confluence of two or more rivers is often a\nvenerated and holy place. The most famous is Prayag or Allahabad, where the\nSarasvati by an underground course is believed to join the Jumna and the\nGanges.\n\n[39:1](ry028.htm#fr_160) The botanical names of the trees mentioned in the\ntext are Grislea Tormentosa, Shorea Robusta, Echites Antidysenterica, Bignonia\nSuaveolens, Aegle Marmelos, and Diospyrus Glutinosa. I have omitted the\n_Kutaja_ (Echites) and the _Tinduka_ (Diospyrus).\n\n[39:2](ry028.htm#fr_161) Here we meet with a fresh myth to account for the\nname of these regions. _Malaja_ is probably a non-Aryan word signifying a\nhilly country: taken as a Sanskrit compound it means _sprung from defilement_.\nThe word _Kar usha_ appears to have a somewhat similar meaning.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXVII.: The Birth of Tadaka.](ry029.htm)\n\n"
