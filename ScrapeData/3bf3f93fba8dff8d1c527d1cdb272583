The offering to the manes secures long life and heaven, is worthy of\npraise and a rite ensuring prosperity. 1\n\n2\\. Persons who sanctify the company are, a Trimadhu, a Tri _n_ a _k_ iketa, a\nTrisupar _n_ a, one who keeps five fires, and one who knows the six A\xe1\xb9\x85gas, one\nwho performs the vow called _S_ iras, one who knows the Gyesh _th_ asaman,\n(and) a Snataka; 2\n\n3\\. On failure of these, one who knows the (texts called) Rahasya. 3\n\np. 267\n\n4\\. The _Ri_ k-verses, the Ya _g_ us-formulas, and the Samans (give) lustre to\na funeral offering. Therefore he may feed (on that occasion) even a Sapi _n_\n_d_ a relation who (knows) those (texts). 4\n\n5\\. Let him who feeds (Brahma _n_ as at a funeral sacrifice) cause them to\nhear successively the Rakshoghna Samans, the Ya _g_ us-formulas (called)\nSvadhavat, the _Ri_ k-verses (called) Madhu, and the (texts called) Pavitras.\n5\n\n6\\. Having invited on the day before (the _S_ raddha), or just in the morning,\nvirtuous, pure (men), such as Trimadhus, who know the Veda\xe1\xb9\x85gas and the sacred\ntexts, who are not related by marriage, nor members of the same family, nor\nconnected through the Veda, at least three, (but always) an odd number, the\n(sacrificer) makes them sit down on prepared seats, covered with Darbha grass,\nfacing the east or the north. 6\n\n7\\. Then he offers to them water mixed with sesamum seed, adorns them with\nscents and garlands (and says), 'I wish to offer oblations in the fire.' 7\n\np. 268\n\n[paragraph continues] When he has received permission (to do so), he heaps\nfuel on the sacred fire, scatters Ku _s_ a grass around it, performs (all the\nceremonies) up to the end of the Agnimukha, and offers three burnt oblations\nof food only, (reciting the following texts): 'To Soma, accompanied by the\nmanes, Svaha!' 'To Yama, accompanied by the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras and by the manes, Svaha!'\n'To Agni, who carries the offerings to the manes, who causes sacrifices to be\nwell performed, Svaha!'\n\n8\\. He shall make these three oblations with food only which has been\nsprinkled with the remainder of the (clarified butter). 8\n\n9\\. Let him give a cake of food to the birds.\n\n10\\. For it is declared in the Veda, 'The manes roam about in the shape of\nbirds.'\n\n11\\. Next he touches the (other food) with his hand and with the thumb,\n\n12\\. (And recites the following texts): 'Fire sees thee, who art co-extensive\nwith the earth, the _Ri_ k-verses are thy greatness, lest the gift be in vain;\nthe earth is the vessel for thee, the sky the cover; I offer thee in the mouth\nof Brahman, I offer thee in the Pra _n_ a and the Apana of learned Brahma _n_\nas; thou art imperishable, mayest thou never fail to (the manes of our)\nfathers yonder, in the other world.' 'Air hears thee, who art co-extensive\nwith the middle sphere, 12\n\np. 269\n\nthe Ya _g_ us-formulas are thy greatness, lest the gift be in vain; the earth\nis the vessel for thee, the sky the cover; . . . mayest thou never fail to the\n(manes of our) grandfathers yonder, in the other world.' 'The sun reveals\nthee, who art co-extensive with the sky, the Samans are thy greatness, lest\nthe gift be in vain; . . . . mayest thou never fail to the (manes of our)\ngreat-grandfathers yonder, in the other world.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[266:1](sbe1468.htm#fr_1272) **14**. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 7, 16, 1-2.\n\n[266:2](sbe1468.htm#fr_1273) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 7, 17, 22; Vasish _th_ a III, 19.\nGovinda states that the Atharvavedins know the vow called _S_ iras; see also\nVasish _th_ a XXVI, 12, and note.\n\n[266:3](sbe1468.htm#fr_1274) Govinda says that persons acquainted with the\nRahasyas or p. 267 \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas are preferable to those mentioned in the\npreceding Sutra, and thus the order must be reversed.\n\n[267:4](sbe1468.htm#fr_1275) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 7, 17, 5.\n\n[267:5](sbe1468.htm#fr_1276) The texts on which the Rakshoghna Samans are\nbased occur Sama-veda I, 1, 1, 3, 4--6; the Svadhavat Ya _g_ us, Taitt. Brahma\n_n_ a I, 3, 10, 2; the Madhu _Ri_ _k_ as, Rig-veda I, 90, 6; and the three\nPavitras, Taitt. Brahma _n_ a I, q, 8, 2.\n\n[267:6](sbe1468.htm#fr_1277) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 7, 14, 5. All the MSS., including\nthose of the commentary, read yonigotramantrasambandhan instead of\nyonigotramantrasambandhan. But the explanation of gotrasambandha _h_ by\nasagotra _h_ shows still a faint trace of the former existence of the reading\nwhich I have restored conjecturally and translated. Its correctness is proved\nby the parallel passage of \xc3\x82pastamba.\n\n[267:7](sbe1468.htm#fr_1278) Vish _n_ u LXXIII, 12--13; Manu III, 208-211. The\nAgnimukha p. 268 is a term denoting all the preliminaries which precede the\nPradhanahoma of a ceremony. The Dekhan and Gu _g_ arat MSS. read a _g_ yasya\ninstead of annasyaiva.\n\n[268:8](sbe1468.htm#fr_1279) Clarified butter is necessary for the rites\nincluded in the Agnimukha.\n\n[268:12](sbe1468.htm#fr_1280) The Mantras are addressed to the food which is\nto be offered.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Adhyaya 8, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 15](sbe1469.htm)\n\n"
