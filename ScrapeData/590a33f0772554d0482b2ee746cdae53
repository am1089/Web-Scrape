 \nAnd let the chouries*,  2 thus restored,  \nWave glorious o'er the rightful lord.  \nI kept my watch, thy word obeyed,  \nAnd by the cave a year I stayed.  \nBut when I saw that stream of blood  \nRush from the cavern in a flood,  \nMy sad heart broken with dismay.  \nAnd every wandering sense astray,  \nI barred the entrance with a stone,--  \nA crag from some high mountain thrown--  \nTurned from the spot I watched in vain.  \nAnd to Kishkindha came again.  \nMy deep distress and downcast mien  \nBy citizen and lord were seen.  \nThey made me king against my will:  \nForgive me if the deed was ill.  \nTrue as I ever was I see  \nMy honoured king once more in thee;  \nI only ruled a while the state  \nWhen thou hadst left us desolate.  \n\nThis town with people, lords, and lands,  \nLay as a trust in guardian hands:  \nAnd now, my gracious lord, accept  \nThe kingdom which thy servant kept.  \nForgive me, victor of the foe,  \nNor let thy wrath against me glow.  \nSee joining suppliant hands I pray,  \nAnd at thy feet my head I lay.  \nBelieve my words: against my will  \nThe royal seat they made me fill.  \nUnkinged they saw the city, hence  \nThey made me lord for her defence.'  \n   But Bali, though I humbly sued,  \nReviled me in his furious mood:  \n'Out on thee, wretch!' in wrath he cried  \nWith many a bitter taunt beside  \nHe summoned every lord, and all  \nHis subjects gathered at his call.  \nThen forth his burning anger broke,  \nAnd thus amid his friends he spoke:  \n'I need not tell, for well ye know,  \nHow fierce Mayavi, fiend and foe,  \nCame to Kishkindha's gate by night,  \nAnd dared me in his wrath to fight.  \nI heard each word the demon said:  \nForth from my royal hall I sped;  \nAnd, foe in brother's guise concealed,  \nSugriva followed to the field.  \nThe mighty demon through the shade  \nBeheld me come with one to aid:  \nThen shrinking from unequal fight.  \nHe turned his back in swiftest flight.  \nFrom vengeful foes his life to save  \nHe sought the refuge of a cave.  \nThen when I saw the fiend had fled  \nWithin that cavern dark and dread,  \nThus to my brother cruel-eyed.  \nImpatient in my wrath, I cried:  \n'I seek no more my royal town  \nTill I have struck the demon down.  \nHere by the cavein's mouth remain  \nUntil my hand the foe have slain.'  \nUpon his faith my heart relied,  \nAnd swift within the depths I hied.  \nA year went by: in every spot  \nI sought the fiend, but found him not.  \nAt length my foe I saw and slew.  \nWhom long I feared when lost to view;  \nAnd all his kinsmen by his side  \nBeneath my vengeful fury died.  \nThe monster, as he reeled and fell,  \nPoured forth his blood with roar and yell;  \nAnd, filling all the cavern, dyed  \nThe portal with the crimson tide.  \nUpon my foeman slain at last  \nOne look, one pitying look, I cast.  \nI sought again the light of day:  \nThe cave was closed and left no way.  \nTo the barred mouth I sadly came,  \nAnd called aloud Sugriva's name.  \nBut all was still: no voice replied,  \n\np. 335  \n\nAnd hope within my bosom died.  \nWith furious efforts, vain at first,  \nThrough bars of rock my way I burst.  \nThen, free once more, the path that brought  \nMy feet in safety home I sought.  \n'Twas thus Sugriva dared despise  \nThe claim of brothers' friendly ties.  \nWith crags of rock he barred me in,  \nAnd for himself the realm would win.  \n   Thus Bali spoke in words severe;  \nAnd then, unmoved by ruth or fear,  \nLeft me a single robe and sent  \nHis brother forth in banishment.  \nHe cast me out with scathe and scorn,  \nAnd from my side my wife was torn,  \nNow in great fear and ill at ease  \nI roam this land with woods and seas,  \nOr dwell on Rishyamuka's hill,  \nAnd sorrow for my consort still.  \nThou hast the tale how first arose  \nThis bitter hate of brother foes.  \nSuch are the griefs neath which I pine,  \nAnd all without a fault of mine.  \nO swift to save in hour of fear,  \nMy prayer who dread this Bali, hear  \nWith gracious love assistance deign,  \nAnd mine oppressor's arm restrain.'  \n   Then Raghu's son, the good and brave,  \nWith a gay laugh his answer gate:  \n'These shafts of mine which ne'er can fail,  \nBefore whose sheen the sun grows pale,  \nWinged by my fury, fleet and fierce,  \nThe wicked Bali's heart shall pierce.  \nYea, mark the words I speak, so long  \nShall live that wretch who joys in wrong,  \nUntil these angered eyes have seen  \nThe robber of thy darling queen.  \nI, taught by equal suffering, know  \nWhat waves of grief above thee flow.  \nThis hand thy captive wife shall free,  \nAnd give thy kingdom back to thee.'  \n   Sugriva joyed as Rama spoke,  \nAnd valour in his breast awoke.  \nHis eye grew bright, his heart grew bold,  \nAnd thus his wondrous tale he told:  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[334:1](ry284.htm#fr_566) The canopy or royal umbrella, one of the usual\nIndian regalia.\n\n[334:2](ry284.htm#fr_567) Whisks made of the hair of the Yak or Bos grunniers,\nalso regal insignia.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XI.: Dundubhi.](ry285.htm)\n\n"
