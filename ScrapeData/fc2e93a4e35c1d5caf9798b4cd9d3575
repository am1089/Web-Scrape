It presupposes the theory of the incarnation of God as man,\nwhich makes it possible to think of God in human relations and in human ways.\nThe idea of God as father is indeed as old as the Vedas. It is expressed also\nin several passages of the Gita (9.17, 11.43, 11.44, 14.4) and in the Puranas,\nin the Nyaya-bhashya of Vatsyayana, as well as elsewhere. Nevertheless it did\nnot, during this period, seem to gain much strength in the way of fostering an\nintimate relation with God or of affecting worship. Wherever it appears it\nseems to be but one of the many passing phases in which God\'s relation to man\nis viewed when God is praised and extolled in His greatness as Lord and\nMaster. But in the new school of bhakti the conception of God as creator,\nsupporter, father, lord and master, or as the ultimate philosophical\nprinciple, is subordinated to the conception of god as the nearest and\ndearest. The most important feature is His nearness to and His intimacy with\nus--not His great powers, which create\n\np. 142\n\na distance between Him and us. That He is the greatest of the great and the\nHighest of the high, that there is nothing greater and higher than Him is\nadmitted by all. His greatness, however, does not reveal the secret of why He\nshould be so dear to us. He may be the greatest, highest, loftiest and the\nmost transcendent, but yet He has made His home in our hearts and has come\ndown to our level to give us His affection and love. Indeed He is conceived as\nso near to us that we can look upon Him and love Him with the love of a very\ndear friend, or with the devotion and the intensity of love of a spouse. Love\nis a great leveller; the best way of realizing God is by making Him an equal\npartner in life by the force of intense love. 1\n\nThe legend of Krishna supplies a human touch to God\'s dealings with men. With\nthe help of this legend the bhaktas of the new school, by a peculiar mystical\nturn of mind, could conceive of God as at once a great being with transcendent\npowers and also as an intimate friend or a dear lover maintaining human\nrelations with his bhaktas. The episodes of Krishna\'s life in Brindaban are\nspiritualized. They are often conceived to happen on a non-physical plane\nwhere both Krishna and his partners are thought to play their parts of love\nand friendship in non-physical bodies. Thus they are not regarded as\nparticular events that took place at specific points of time in the life of a\nparticular man, Krishna. They are interpreted as the eternal, timeless and\nspaceless play of God with His own associates and His energies, with whom He\neternally realizes Himself in love and friendship. The\n\np. 143\n\npart that his bhaktas had to play was to identify themselves, by a great\nstretch of sympathy, as partners in or spectators of God\'s love-play, and find\ntheir fullest satisfaction in the satisfaction of God. For a true bhakta, it\nis not necessary, therefore, that his sense-inclinations should be destroyed.\nWhat is necessary is merely that these should be turned towards God and not\ntowards himself, i.e., that he use his senses not for his own worldly\nsatisfaction but to find enjoyment and satisfaction in the great love-drama of\nGod by identifying himself with one of the spiritual partners of God in his\nlove-play. Hence it is not essential that all desires and sense-functions, as\nthe Gita says, be destroyed, or that the individual behave as if he had\ndesires while yet being absolutely desireless. It was required that the bhakta\nhave the fullest satisfaction of his sense and inclinations by participating\nin the joys of Krishna in his divine love-play. For such participation and\nvicarious enjoyment was regarded as true love ( _preman_ ), while the\nsatisfaction of one\'s own senses or of one\'s own worldly purposes was viewed\nas a vicious passion. Thus here we have a new scheme of life. The ideal of\ndesirelessness and absolute self-control is replaced by that of participation\nin a drama of divine joy, and the desires are given full play in the direction\nof God. Desires are not to be distinguished; only their directions are to be\nchanged. 2\n\nThough this form of bhakti has in various circles at times been debased and\nencroached upon by diverse kinds of eroticism or erotic mysticism, it cannot\nbe\n\np. 144\n\ndenied that many of the immediate and later followers of Chaitanya achieved\ngreat spiritual success in this form of bhakti-worship. In the Narayaniya\nchapter of the fifth canto of the Mahabharata God is spoken of as a father,\nmother and teacher; and in the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali and elsewhere the idea\nis often expressed that God originally taught the Vedas to the sages and that\nHe is therefore the original teacher. In all these writings, however, the love\nof God supercedes deep reverence. The true bhakta looked upon God as the\ndivine dispenser; he considered all that he had--kingdoms, riches, wife and\nall that he could call his own--to be God\'s. Love of God as the mother of the\nworld plays an important part in the religious attitude of many bhakti\nworshippers. This is particularly true in the case of Ramprasad and others,\nnotably the sage Ramakrishna of recent times. And in this attribution of\nmotherliness to God both Ramprasad and Ramakrishna view Him as a tender mother\nwho is always helping her child, condoning his sins and transgressions,\npartial to his weaknesses and concerned to better him. Nevertheless He cannot\nbe attained by mere formal worship but only through a whole-hearted worship,\nwith a proper control of the sense-inclinations. 3\n\nThe theory of bhakti seems to have its original source in the Pancaratra\nschool of Vaishnavism. However, the doctrine of supreme self-surrender to\nNarayana, Hari or Krishna as the one and only God in disregard of all other\nmythical gods, represents a teaching of the Gita, the chief work of the Ekanti\n\np. 145\n\nschool of Vaishnavas; and this doctrine forms the universal basis of all kinds\nof bhakti worship, though among the Shaktas or Shaivas the supreme deity went\nby the name of Shakti or Shiva. The Gita plainly teaches, as we have already\npointed out in our previous lecture, that there is no other God but Narayana\nor Krishna, that He alone is great and that we should lay aside all other\nmodes of religious worship and take refuge in Him. In Chaitanya this devotion\nto God developed into a life-absorbing passion; yet in all advanced forms of\nbhakti the chief emphasis is on supreme attachment to God. The sort of bhakti\nwhich Prahlada asked as a boon from Hari was such an attachment for Him as\nworldly persons have for the objects of their senses. Such a bhakti, as\ndescribed in the Bhagavata or the Shandilya sutra, is not worship out of a\nsense of duty or mere meditation on God or mere singing of His name, but it is\ndeep affection ( _anurakti_ ). It is therefore neither knowledge nor any kind\nof activity, but is a feeling. And the taking of refuge ( _prapatti_ ) in God\nis also not motivated by knowledge but by a deep affection which impels the\nindividual to take his first and last stay in Him. But though a feeling, this\nbhakti does not bind anyone to the world. For the world is but a manifestation\nof God\'s maya, and God so arranges for those who love Him that His maya cannot\nbind His bhakta to the world. 4\n\nBut how is such a bhakti possible? For this also we have ultimately to depend\non God. There is a passage in the Upanishads (Katha II. 23) which states\n\np. 146\n\nthat He can be attained by him whom He (God) chooses. This text has often been\ncited to indicate that it is only the chosen man of God who has the privilege\nof possessing a special affection for God. Vallabha declares this special\nfavor ( _pushti_ ) of God indispensable for the rise of such an affection for\nGod. He further holds that according to the different degrees of the favor of\nGod one may have different degrees of affection for Him, though by avoiding\nthe commission of sinful actions, by cleansing the mind of the impurities of\nworldly passions, and by inclining the mind towards God, one may go a great\nway in deserving His special favor. It is only by the highest special favor of\nGod that one\'s affection or attachment for Him can become an all-consuming and\nall-engulfing passion ( _vyasana_ \\--see the Prameyaratnarnava). True devotion\nto God, affection or love for Him, must always be an end in itself and never a\nmeans to any other end, not even salvation or liberation, so much praised in\nthe classical systems of philosophy. This all-absorbing passion for God is the\nbhakta\'s eternal stay in God, and dearer to him than liberation or any other\ngoal of religious realization. 5\n\nIt is not out of place here to mention that among various Hindu sects it was\nheld that an engrossing passion of any kind may so possess the whole mind that\nall other mental functions may temporarily be suspended, and that gradually,\nthrough the repeated occurrence of such a passion, the other mental functions\nmay be altogether annihilated. Thus, absorption in a single supreme passion\nmay make the mind\n\np. 147\n\nso one-pointed that all other attachments are transcended and the individual\nattains Brahmahood (see the Spandapradipika). In the Upanishads\n(Brihadaranyaka IV. 3.21) we find that the bliss of Brahman is compared with\nthe loving embrace of a beloved woman. To love one\'s husband and to serve him\nas a god was regarded from very early times as the only spiritualizing duty\nfor a woman. Hence the idea that ordinary man-and-woman love may be so\nperfected as to become a spiritual force easily won acceptance in certain\ncircles. This man-and-woman love developed an absorbing and dominant passion,\ncompletely independent and unaided by other considerations of marital and\nparental duties. In its non-marital forms, it was considered to be capable of\nbecoming so deep as to become by itself a spiritualizing force. Moreover, it\nwas thought that the transition from human love to divine love was so easy\nthat a man who had specialized in the experience of deep man-and-woman love of\na non-marital type could easily change the direction of his love from woman to\nGod, and thus indulge in a passionate love for God. The story is told that in\nhis early career the saint Bilvamangala became so deeply attached to a\ncourtesan named Cintamani that one night he swam across a river supported by a\nfloating corpse, then scaled a high wall by holding on to the tail of a\nserpent, and finally well-nigh broke his limbs in jumping down from the wall\ninto the yard of Cintamani. The woman, however, rebuked him, saying that if he\nentertained toward God a little of the love that he had for her he would be a\nsaint. This produced\n\np. 148\n\nsuch a wonderful change in Bilvamangala that he forthwith became a God-\nintoxicated man. Later, in his saintly life, when he once again felt attracted\nby a woman, he plucked out his eyes so that external forms and colors might\nnot further tempt him. This blind saint became one of the best-reputed among\nall the saints, devoting his life to the love of God. 6\n\nThus there grew up a school of mystics, including the great poet Candidas and\nothers, who devoted themselves to the cultivation of the spirituality of love\nand the deification of human love, and who thought that more could be learned\nthrough such efforts than through any other mode of worship. "There is no god\nor goddess in Heaven who can teach spiritual truths more than the person whom\none loves with the whole heart." The goddess Basuli whom Candidas worshipped\nis said to have admonished him to adhere to his love for the washerwoman Rami,\nsaying that Rami would be able to teach him truths that no one else could, and\nto lead him to such bliss as not even the creator himself might do. A somewhat\nsimilar idea of the purificatory power of intense human love is found in the\nVishnupurana. In describing the illicit love of a cowherd-girl for Krishna,\nthe Vishnupurana says that at her separation from him she underwent so much\nsuffering that all her sins were expiated, and that in thinking of him in her\nseparation from him she had so much delight as would be equal to the\ncollective culmination of all the happiness that she could enjoy as a reward\nof her virtuous actions. By the combination of the suffering and the bliss,\nshe exhausted\n\np. 149\n\nall the fruits of her bad and good deeds, and thus by her thoughts of Krishna\nshe attained her liberation. Somewhat allied with the idea of human worship,\nthough not of the man-and-women type just mentioned, is a certain attitude\nsometimes adopted toward man as a religious teacher. The latter was considered\nin many circles as the representative of God on earth, and self-surrender,\nlove and devotion to him was considered to lead one to God. This sort of\nworship was prevalent among the Hindus and the Buddhists from pretty early\ntimes. One fact should be noted. It was associated with reverence and a sense\nof the religious teacher\'s superiority, whereas the other type of worship\n(through romantic love) raised the man and woman by their constancy and\nsufferings for each other and the happiness that each enjoys in the company\nand thought of the other. In this latter case, love is religion, and all pain\nendured for the beloved, joy. With the exception of the phase of love-\nmysticism just mentioned, I have thus far confined myself to a description of\ndifferent forms of mysticism as portrayed in Sanskrit writings. I shall now\nturn to the mysticism of divine love that found expression in the vernaculars\nof North India and of the South. But this is a vast subject and I can say only\na few words. 7\n\nLet me advert first to the Alvar saints of the South, the earliest of whom\nbelonged to the second and the latest to the tenth century, A. D. They all\nwrote psalms or songs in Tamil, a Dravidian tongue of South India. They were\ninspired by the teachings of Vaishnavism when it travelled from the North to\nthe South.\n\np. 150\n\n[paragraph continues] Their doctrines were more or less similar to those\ntouched upon in the preceding lecture in connection with the bhakti mysticism\nof the Bhagavata Purana and the Gita. They are embodied in psalms and not in\nany connected philosophical treatise. Describing his insatiable love of God,\nNam Alvar says:\n\n"As I dote on the Lord of Katkarai (God)  \nWhose streets with scarlet lily are perfumed  \nMy heart for his wonderful graces melts  \nHow then can I, my restless love suppress?" 1\n\n[paragraph continues] With reference to Nam Alvar, Govindacarya has said:\n"Briefly, Saint Nam Alvar declares that when one is overcome by bhakti\nexaltation, trembling in every cell of his being, he must freely and passively\nallow this influence to penetrate his being, and carry him beyond all known\nstates of consciousness; never from fear or shame that bystanders may take him\nfor a madman, ought the exhibition of this bhakti-rapture that deluges his\nbeing, to be suppressed. The very madness is the means of distinguishing him\nfrom the ordinary mortals to whom such beatific vision is necessarily denied.\nThe very madness is the bhakta\'s pride. In that very madness, the saint\nexhorts, "run, jump, cry, laugh and sing, and let every man witness it." 8\n\nLet us now pass on to other saints of the South, Namdev and Tukaram. The\nbhakti school referred to in the last lecture, and most of the other branches\nof this school, developed under purely Brahminic traditions and in the shadow\nof Brahminic scriptures,\n\np. 151\n\nthe Puranas and the like. And though in the Bhagavata we find that even the\nforeign and aboriginal races of the Kiratas, Hunas, Andhras, Pulindas,\nPukkasas, Abhiras, Suhmas, Yavanas, Khasas, etc., become pure if they are\nattached to God, yet the Brahminic civilization had such a hold over the\ncountry that the cult of bhakti grew up around the traditional cult of Rama,\nor Krishna, Shiva or Shakti. Representation of God in images and their worship\nby the bhaktas, faith in the legends of Krishna and other inferior deities as\ntold in the Puranas, preferential treatment of the Brahmin caste, respect to\nthe Vedas, etc., became very intimately associated with the doctrine of bhakti\npreached in the Puranas and other Sanskrit scriptures. We know, of course,\nthat the bhakti cult spread also among foreigners. Thus, in the second century\nB. C., the Greek king Heliodorus, son of Dios, dedicated to Vasudeva a\nflagstaff bearing an image of the bird Garuda, on which the God Vasudeva or\nKrishna was said to ride. Now, though the sons of some demons are also known\nto have been great bhaktas, as described in the Puranas, yet the latter all\naccepted the traditional God Vasudeva and they regarded the legends associated\nwith Krishna or Vasudeva as real episodes of his life. In the thirteenth\ncentury A. D., we find that Visoba Khecar, the teacher of the bhakta Namdev,\ndenounced the worship of images as a substitute for the God Krishna or for any\nother god. He is said to have instructed Namdev to abandon image-worship,\nsaying: "A stone god never speaks. What possibility then of his removing the\ndisease of mundane\n\np. 152\n\nexistence? A stone image is regarded as God, but the true God is wholly\ndifferent. If a stone god fulfills desires, how is it he breaks when struck?\nThose who adore a god made of stone, lose everything through their folly.\nThose who say and hear that a god of stone speaks to his devotees are both of\nthem fools. Whether a holy place is small or large there is no god but stone\nor water. There is no place which is devoid of God. That God has shown Nama in\nhis heart and thus Khecar conferred a blessing on him." 2 Namdev was a tailor\nby caste and he worshipped the idol at Pandharpur in the Maratha country in\nSouth India. However, he had a full knowledge of the true nature of God, as\nhad other bhaktas of Sanskritic traditions. Thus he says: "The Veda has to\nspeak by Thy might and the Sun has to move round; such is the might of Thee,\nthe Lord of the Universe. Knowing this essential truth I have surrendered\nmyself to Thee. By Thy might it is that the clouds have to pour down rain,\nmountains to rest firm and the wind to blow." 3 Again: "Vows, fasts and\nausterities are not at all necessary; nor is it necessary for you to go on a\npilgrimage. Be you watchful in your hearts and always sing the name of Hari.\nIt is not necessary to give up eating food or drinking water; fix your mind on\nthe foot of Hari. Neither is it necessary for you to contemplate the one\nwithout attributes. Hold fast to the love of the name of Hari." "Recognize him\nalone to be a righteous man, who sees Vasudeva in all objects,\n\np. 153\n\neradicating all pride or egoism. The rest are entangled in the shackles of\ndelusion. To him all wealth is like earth, and the nine gems are mere stones.\nThe two, desire and anger, he has thrown out, and he cherishes in his heart\nquietude and forgiveness." 4 Again he says: "Firmly grasp the truth which is\nNarayana. Purity of conduct should not be abandoned; one should not be afraid\nof the censure of people and thus accomplish one\'s own purpose. Surrender\nyourself to your loving friend (God) giving up all ostentation and pride. The\ncensure of people should be regarded as praise and their praise not heeded.\nOne should entertain no longing for being respected and honored, but should\nnourish in oneself a liking for devotion. This should be rendered firm in the\nmind and the name of God should not be neglected even for a moment." 5 9\n\nThe essence of the teachings of Namdev, as of almost all the other bhaktas of\nwhom I shall now be speaking, is purity of mind, speech, and deed, utter\ndisregard of castes, creeds and other social distinctions, a tendency to leave\nall for God, and in love and joy to live in God always, utterly ignoring all\nsocial, communal and religious prejudices, narrowness, dogmas and bigotry. It\nis held that God is omnipotent and omnipresent and that He cannot be\nidentified with any particular deity or his character properly narrated by any\nparticular legendary or mythical ways of thinking. At the same time it is\ncontended\n\np. 154\n\nthat we may call him by any name we like, for He is always the same in all. 10\n\nAnother great Maratha saint was Tukaram of the seventeenth century. Tukaram\nwas a low class Hindu. His father was a petty trader. When his father, in his\nold age, wanted to give over his business to his eldest son Savji, the latter\nrefused the task since he did not wish a worldly life. So the business was\nentrusted to Tukaram when he was at the age of thirteen. Four years later his\nfather died. Then Tukaram was imposed upon by crafty persons and his business\nwas wrecked. His wife, however, procured a loan; the business was restored and\nthen he began to prosper. Once, however, while he was returning home, Tukaram\nmet a man who was on the point of being dragged to prison for his debts.\nTukaram at once gave all that he had to this debtor in order to achieve his\nrelease. From that time on Tukaram renounced all worldly vocations and devoted\nhis life to singing the glories of God and the dearness of our relations to\nHim. He employed a particular kind of verse which he often composed extempore\nand in which he frequently spoke. Thus Tukaram says: "God is ours, certainly\nours, and is the soul of all souls. God is near to us, certainly near, outside\nand inside. God is benignant, certainly benignant, and fulfills every longing\neven of a longing nature." Again he says: "This thy nature is beyond the grasp\nof the mind or of words, and therefore I have made devoted love a measure. I\nmeasure the endless by the measure of love. He is not to be truly measured by\nany other means. Thou\n\np. 155\n\nart not to be found by processes of concentration, sacrificial rites, practice\nof austerities, or any bodily exertions, or by knowledge. Oh Kesava, accept\nthe service which we render to thee in the simplicity of our hearts." Still\nagain: "The Endless is beyond, and between him and me there are lofty\nmountains of desire and anger. I am not able to ascend them, nor do I find any\npass. Insurmountable is the ascent of my enemies. What possibility is there of\nmy attaining my friend Narayana (God)?" He expresses his heart full of longing\nfor God in the following words: 6\n\n"As on the bank the poor fish lies  \nAnd gasps and writhes in pain,  \nOr, as a man with anxious eyes  \nSeeks hidden gold in vain,--  \nSo is my heart distressed and cries  \nTo come to thee again.  \n    Thou knowest, Lord, the agony  \n    Of the lost infant\'s wail  \n    Yearning his mother\'s face to see.  \n      (How oft I tell this tale.)  \n    O, at thy feet the mystery  \nOf the dark world unveil.  \nThe fire of this harassing thought  \nUpon my bosom prays.  \nWhy is it I am thus forgot?  \n(O, who can know thy ways?)  \nNay, Lord, thou seest my hapless lot;  \nHave mercy, Tuka says."\n\nDesolate and disconsolate for the love of God he prays at His door:\n\np. 156\n\n"A beggar at thy door,  \nPleading I stand;  \nGive me an alms, O God,  \nLove from thy loving hand.  \n    Spare me the barren task,  \n    To come, and to come for nought.  \n    A gift poor Tuka craves,  \n    Unmerited, unbought."\n\nAgain:\n\n"O save me, save me, Mightiest,  \nSave me and set me free.  \nO let the love that fills my breast  \nCling to thee lovingly.  \n    Grant me to taste how sweet thou art;  \n    Grant me but this, I pray,  \n    And never shall my love depart  \n    Or turn from thee away.  \nThen I thy name shall magnify  \nAnd tell thy praise abroad,  \nFor very love and gladness I  \nShall dance before my God.  \n    Grant to me, Vitthal, that I rest  \n    Thy blessed feet beside;  \n    Ah, give me this, the dearest, best,  \n    And I am satisfied." 11\n\nLeaving this bhakti movement of the South, which dates from the thirteenth to\nthe seventeenth century, from Jnanesvar and Namdev to Tukaram, we pass to the\nbhakti movement of North India, represented by Kabir, Nanak and others. It\nfollowed the line traced by the Gita and the Bhagavata. Having been developed\nin the vernacular, however, it appealed directly to the masses. It largely\ndissociated itself from the complex entanglements of Hindu mythology which had\nenmeshed\n\np. 157\n\nthe devotional creed of spiritual loyalty to God in the legend of Krishna and\nhis associates. 12\n\nKabir (1440-1518) was an abandoned child, probably because of the illegitimacy\nof his birth. He was brought up by a weaver, Niru, and his wife, Nina.\nThroughout his life he lived in Benares, probably himself following the\nprofession of a weaver. He is said to have been a disciple of Ramananda, a\ndisciple of Ramanuja, the great Vaishnava teacher of the South. But he\nlikewise came into touch with some Mohammedan Pirs and was also probably\nacquainted with certain forms of Sufism. His was a religion which derived its\nlife from what was best among both the Hindus and the Mohammedans. However, he\ndisliked the bigotry and superstitions of all formal religions and was\nconsequently persecuted by both the Hindus and the Mohammedans. With him and\nhis followers, such as Ruidas and Dadu, we find a religion which shook off all\nthe traditional limitations of formal religions, with their belief in revealed\nbooks and their acceptance of mythological stories, and of dogmas and creeds\nthat often obscure the purity of the religious light and contact with God.\nKabir considered the practice of yoga, alms, and fasting, and the feeding of\nBrahmins, not only useless but improper without the repetition of God\'s name\nand love for Him. He discarded the Hindu ideas regarding purity, external\nablutions and contact with so-called impure things with as much force as he\nrejected the Mohammedan belief in circumcision or the requirement that a\nBrahmin should wear a holy thread, or any other marks of caste. When\n\np. 158\n\n[paragraph continues] Kabir\'s parents found that they could not subdue his\nHindu tendencies they wanted to circumcise him, and at this he said:\n\n"Whence have come the Hindus and Mussulmans? Who hath put them in their\ndifferent ways,  \nHaving thought and reflected in thy heart, answer this--who shall obtain\nHeaven and who Hell." 7 13\n\nNow we know that the doctrine of bhakti had a great levelling influence. Even\naccording to the Gita and the Bhagavata Purana, bhakti removed all\ninequalities of caste and social status. We know that Haridas (his Mohammedan\nname is not known) was converted from Mohammedanism to Vaishnavism by\nChaitanya and Nityananda. In lauding him Chaitanya once said: "Your holy\nthoughts are as the streams of the Ganges in which your soul bathes every\nhour. Your pious acts earn for you that virtue which the people seek in\nsacrificial rites prescribed in the scriptures. You are constantly in touch\nwith the loftiest of ideals which give you the same merit as the study of the\nVedas. What sadhu or Brahmin is there who is good and great as you are?" 8 In\nthe Brihat Naradiya Purana we find that even a candala (the lowest caste among\nthe Hindus) becomes the greatest of all Brahmins if he loves God. So the new\nreligious ideal of bhakti, in all its enthusiastic circles, dispensed with\n\np. 159\n\nthe considerations of caste, creed, and social status. 14\n\nThere was, therefore, nothing particularly novel in Kabir\'s insistence that\nthe time-honored distinctions of caste, creed and social status are absolutely\nvalueless or in his emphasis upon the need of bhakti for all, as that which\nalone exalts a man. But in Kabir we find a reformatory zeal. He never tires of\nreiterating the worthlessness of all these superstitions of caste, creed,\nsocial status, external purity and impurity, penances, asceticism, and all\nsorts of formalities which passed by the name of religion though in fact\nhaving nothing to do with it. Thus Kabir says:\n\n"If union with God be obtained by going about naked,  \nAll the deer of the forest shall be saved.  \nWhat mattereth it whether man goeth naked or weareth a deerskin,  \nIf he recognize not God in his heart?  \nIf perfection be obtained by shaving the head,  \nWhy should not sheep obtain salvation?  \nIf, O brethren, the continent man is saved,  \nWhy should not a eunuch obtain the supreme reward?  \nSaith Kabir, hear, O my brethren,  \nWho hath obtained salvation without God\'s name?"\n\nAgain he says:\n\n"They who battle in the evening and the morning  \nAre like frogs in the water.  \nWhen men have no love for God\'s name,  \nThey shall all go to the god of death.  \nThey who love their persons and deck themselves out in various guises,  \nFeel not mercy even in their dreams.  \nMany leading religious men call them quadrupeds,  \nAnd say that only holy men shall obtain happiness in this ocean of trouble. p.\n160  \nSaith Kabir, why perform so many ceremonies?  \nForsaking all other essences quaff the great essence of God\'s name."\n\nThese allusions to bathing and other activities refer to religious practices\nfollowed by many Hindus but vigorously denounced by Kabir. 15\n\nTo a Yogin who said to Kabir that one could not attain deliverance without\nchastening his heart by the performance of yoga Kabir said:\n\n"Without devotion the qualities of the heart cling to the heart,  \nWho secured perfection by merely chastening his heart?  \nWhat holy man has succeeded in chastening his heart?  \nSay who bath saved any one by merely chastening his heart.  \nEvery one thinketh in his heart that he is going to chasten it,  \nBut the heart is not chastened without devotion.  \nSaith Kabir, let him who knoweth this secret  \nWorship in his heart God, the lord of the three worlds."\n\n[paragraph continues] Kabir in speaking of the search after God says:\n\n"When I turned my thoughts toward God, I restrained my mind  \nand my senses, and my attention became lovingly fixed on Him.  \nO Bairagi, search for Him who neither cometh nor goeth, who neither dieth nor\nis.  \nMy soul turning away from sin, is absorbed in the universal soul."\n\n[paragraph continues] Describing the view that God is not confined to any\nmosque, church or temple, Kabir says:\n\n"If God dwell only in the mosque, to whom belongeth the rest of the country?  \nThey who are called Hindus say that God dwelleth in an idol:  \nI see not the truth in either sect.  \nO God, whether Allah or Ram, I live by Thy name,  \nO Lord, show kindness unto me. p. 161  \nHari dwelleth in the south, Allah hath his place in the west.  \nSearch in thy heart, search in thy heart of hearts; there is his place and\nabode.  \nThe Brahmins yearly perform twenty-four fastings . . . the Mussulmans fast in\nthe month of Ramzan.  \n. . . Kabir is a child of Ram and Allah and accepteth all gurus and Pirs."\n\n[paragraph continues] Describing his great love and intoxication for God,\nKabir says:\n\n"I am not skilled in book knowledge, nor do I understand controversy:  \nI have grown mad reciting and hearing God\'s praises.  \nO father, I am mad; the whole world is sane; I am mad;  \nI am ruined; let not others be ruined likewise;  \nI have not grown mad out of my own will; God hath made me mad--  \nThe true guru hath dispelled my doubts--  \nI am ruined, and have lost my intellect;  \nLet nobody be led astray in doubts like mine.  \nHe who knoweth not himself is mad;  \nWhen one knoweth himself he knoweth the one God.  \nHe who is not intoxicated with divine love in this human birth shall never be\nso.  \nSaith Kabir, I am dyed with the dye of God."\n\nThus, on the one hand, Kabir waged war against the prevailing superstitions,\nrituals and litanies of all religions and religious sects; and, on the other\nhand, he dived deep in the depth of God\'s love and he beheld nothing but God\non all sides, becoming as it were one with Him in spiritual union. Thus, he\nsays:\n\n"With both mine eyes I look,  \nBut I behold nothing save God;  \nMine eyes gaze affectionately on Him."\n\np. 162\n\n[paragraph continues] The motto of his life was, as he often said, "Remember\nGod, Remember God, Remember God, my brethren;" and in his own life he felt\nthat he was absorbed in the Infinite. 16\n\nRui Das (also called Ravi Das), a shoe-maker by caste, was another great\ndisciple of Ramananda. His songs and hymns are full of humility and devotion.\nHowever, he evidences none of the reformatory zeal that animated Kabir. I\nshall quote the translation of only one hymn which seems to me typical of Rui\nDas\'s attitude of love towards God. He says:\n\n"There is none so poor as I, none so compassionate as Thou;  \nFor this what further test is now necessary?  \nMay my heart obey thy words, fill thy servant therewith.  \nI am a sacrifice to thee, O God;  \nWhy art thou silent?  \nFor many births have I been separated from Thee, O God;  \nThis birth is on thine own account.  \nSaith Rui Das, putting my hopes in Thee, I live; it is long since I have seen\nthee." 17\n\nStill another great saint of love was Mira Bai, a princess of Rajputana, who\nfrom her childhood (born about 1504 A. D.) was devoted to an image of Lord\nKrishna called Girdharlal. Her marriage proved unhappy. At the time of going\nto her husband\'s place she became very disconsolate. She wept until she became\nunconscious at the idea of leaving the image of Girdharlal behind. So her\nparents gave her the image as a part of her marriage dowry. It proved that\nMira could not get on well with the family of her father-in-law,\n\np. 163\n\nfor she was always given to the adoration and worship of her little image,\nrepresenting to her Lord Krishna, and it was this image that she considered as\nher husband. Her father-in-law made attempts to kill her, but she was\nmiraculously saved. Ultimately she left his abode and went to Brindaban, the\nplace of Lord Krishna\'s activities, to have her passion for Krishna realized.\nHere again, in the case of this princess saint who left her all for Krishna,\nwe find the potency of the Krishna legend. 18\n\nI shall quote here the translation of one of Mira Bai\'s hymns which show her\ngreat attachment for Krishna, in an image of whom, at Dvaraka, she was, as the\ntradition says, ultimately lost. Her soul was so full of deep longing for Lord\nKrishna, or Girdhar as she called him, that she proclaims:\n\n"I have the god Girdhar and no other;  \nHe is my spouse on whose head is a crown of peacock feathers,  \nWho carrieth a shell, discus, mace and lotus, and who weareth a necklace;  \nI have forfeited the respect of the world by ever sitting near holy men.  \nThe matter is now public; everybody knoweth it.  \nHaving felt supreme devotion I die as I behold the world.  \nI have no father, son, or relation with me.  \nI laugh when I behold my beloved; people think I weep.  \nI have planted the vine of love and irrigated it again  \nand again with the water of tears,  \nI have cast away my fear of the world, what can anyone do to me  \nMira\'s love for her god is fixed, come what may." 19\n\nIndia is a land of saints. There are hundreds of\n\np. 164\n\nthem of whom one could say much. But my time is limited and I have well-nigh\nexhausted your patience. Yet I cannot conclude without referring briefly to\nTulsidas, the greatest Hindu poet of India and a great saint.\n\nTulsidas lived in the seventeenth century. He did not inaugurate any new\nfaith, but accepted the Hindu mythology and the theory of the incarnation of\nGod, the appearance of the attributeless God as a God of infinite attributes.\nIn his view Rama was the incarnation of God, the savior and father of mankind.\nAn all-surrendering devotion to him, he believed, is our only duty and the\nsole legitimate passion of life. God is great not only in His greatness, but\nalso in his mercy. He knows the sins and the frailties of men, and is always\nprepared to help them repel their temptations. To run counter to the will of\nGod is sin, and it is only by acknowledging our sins and taking an all-\nsurrendering refuge in Him, in love and faith, that we can be saved. Connected\nherewith was the doctrine of the brotherhood of man and of our duty toward our\nneighbors. Tulsidas is said to have been very much attached to his wife in his\nearly life. On one occasion he followed her to her father\'s place, much to her\nannoyance, and she said that if he had as much love for God Rama as he had for\nher he would be saved. This struck Tulsidas to the heart and he renounced the\nworld. By his great strength of character, his remark-able poetic gifts which\nhe applied to religious subjects, and by his strong faith, Tulsidas soon\nendeared himself to his countrymen. No one has exercised a greater\n\np. 165\n\ninfluence than he over the Hindi-speaking people of North India. 20\n\nI have now described, though but briefly, some of the main types of Indian\nmysticism in their mutual relations; others could not be so much as touched\nupon owing to the limitations of time. I am fully alive to the imperfections\nof my treatment. Great as they are, they must have appeared to you even\ngreater on account of the difficulty that you must have experienced in placing\nyourselves on the mental plane of these mystics. The subtle metaphysical and\nphilosophical background of these different types of mysticism I have here\nbeen compelled to disregard. But I have elsewhere undertaken an historical\nsurvey of all the different systems of Indian Philosophy. 9 Through oral\ninstruction, tradition, and the example of great men who renounced the world\nin pursuance of the high ideals of philosophy, the essence of these different\nsystems, with their spiritual longings and their yearnings after salvation and\nthe cessation of rebirth, have gradually been filtering down into the minds of\nthe masses of the population. The tiller of the soil and the grocer in the\nshop may be uneducated and often wholly illiterate, but even they, while\ntilling the ground, driving a bullock cart or resting after the work of the\nday, will be singing songs full of mystical meaning, and for the moment\ntransporting themselves\n\np. 166\n\nto regions beyond the touch of material gains and comforts:\n\n"The sky and the earth are born of mine own eyes.  \nThe hardness and softness, the cold and the heat are the products of my own\nbody;  \nThe sweet smell and the bad are of my own nose."\n\n[paragraph continues] Or,\n\n"Nobody can tell whence the bird unknown  \nComes into the cage and goes out.  \nI would feign put round its feet the fetter of my mind  \nCould I but capture it." 10\n\nA traveller in the village of Bengal or on board the steamers plying the\nrivers of the interior of rural Bengal, may often hear a middle-aged or old\nMohammedan or a Hindu singing mystical, philosophical or mythical songs of the\nlove of Krishna and Radha, or of the renouncement of the world by Chaitanya,\nwhile a large crowd of men is assembled around the singer listening to him\nwith great reverence and feeling. The singer is probably describing the world\nas a mirage or a mere phantom show of _maya_ , or is expressing the futility\nof his worldly life on account of his having lost his friendship with his own\nself.\n\n"My hope of the world is all false,  \nWhat shall be my fate, O kind, good lord?  \nI am not in love with him (self) with whom  \nI have come to live in this house (body)  \nO kind, good lord."\n\np. 167\n\nSo the sublime teachings of philosophy and the other-worldly aspirations of\nmysticism, with their soothing, plaintive and meditative tendencies, have\nwatered the hearts of Bengal right into the thatched cottages of this land.\nWealth and comfort they all appreciate as do people everywhere, but they all\nknow that money is not everything, and that peace of mind and the ultimate\ngood of man cannot be secured through it or any other worldly thing. They are\nimmersed in the world; but still the wisdom of the ages and the teachings of\nthe saints have not been in vain, and at times they are drawn away from the\nworld--their souls unknowingly long for deliverance and find a mystic delight\nin it. It is only the educated or Anglicized Hindu who, dazzled by the gay\ncolors of the West, sometimes turns a deaf ear to the old tune of his country\n--the flute of Krishna calling from afar through the rustling leaves of\nbamboos and the cocoanut groves of the village homes--and, in the name of\npatriotism and progress, installs a foreign god of money and luxury in the\nancestral throne of the god of the Indian heart--the god of deliverance. The\nthoughts and aspirations of the ages, our myths, our religions, our\nphilosophies, our songs and poetry, have all interpenetrated and formed a\nwhole which cannot be expressed through a portrayal of its elements. They\nrepresent a unique experience which I feel with my countrymen, but which is\nincommunicable to any one who is unable imaginatively to bring himself into\ntune with that spirit. The British in India have understood as much\n\np. 168\n\nof the country as is necessary for policing it, but no foreigner has ever\nadequately understood our land. Those of you who see India through newspapers\nand the strange tales and stories of tourists who "do" India in a month, can\nhardly hope to go right to the place where the heart of India lies. 21\n\nBut, you may perhaps ask, what may I gain by knowing India as it really is at\nits heart? Well, that is a different matter. Perhaps you may derive gain,\nperhaps not. You may further ask what is it that one gains through such\nspiritual longing, realization, or mystical rapture. And I shall frankly\nconfess that one certainly gains nothing that will show itself in one\'s bank\naccount. But with all my appreciation and admiration of the great achievements\nof the West in science, politics and wealth, the Upanishad spirit in me may\nwhisper from within: What have you gained if you have not gained yourself, the\nimmortal, the infinite? What have you gained if you have never tasted in your\nlife the deep longing for deliverance and supreme emancipation? And the spirit\nof the saints of ages whispers in my ears: What have you gained if you have\nnot tasted the joys of self-surrender, if your heart has not longed to make of\nyou a flute in the hands of Krishna, that master musician of the universe, and\nif you have not been able to sweeten all your miseries with a touch of God? 22\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[150:1](hm08.htm#fr_6) Govindacarya\'s translation.\n\n[152:2](hm08.htm#fr_7) Bhandarkar\'s _Vaishnavism_.\n\n[152:3](hm08.htm#fr_8) _Ibid_.\n\n[153:4](hm08.htm#fr_9) _Ibid_.\n\n[153:5](hm08.htm#fr_10) _Ibid_.\n\n[155:6](hm08.htm#fr_11) This and the immediately following translations are\ntaken from Macnicol\'s work, _Psalms of the Maratha Saints_.\n\n[158:7](hm08.htm#fr_12) Most of the translations of Kabir\'s hymns are from the\ntranslation of _The Bijak of Kabir_ by the Rev.
