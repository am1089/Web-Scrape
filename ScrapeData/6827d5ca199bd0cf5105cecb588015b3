Ask whatever questions you will, if we know them, we shall\ndeclare all to you.\n\nSo Kabandhin Katyayana, approaching, asked: Master, where are all these beings\nbrought forth from?\n\nHe answered him: The Lord of beings desired beings. He brooded with fervour;\nand, brooding with fervour, he forms a Pair. They are the Substance and the\nLife. These two will make beings manifold for me, said he. The sun verily is\nthe\n\np. 30\n\n[paragraph continues] Life, and Substance is the moon. For Substance is all\nthat is formed, and the formless is the Life. Therefore the form is the\nSubstance.\n\nSo the sun, rising, enters the eastern space; and thus he gathers all the\neastern lives among his rays. As the southern, the western, the northern, the\nnether, and the upper space, and the spaces between, as he illumines all, so\nhe gathers all lives among his rays. Thus the Life rises as universal, all-\nformed fire.\n\nAnd this is declared by the Vedic verse:\n\nThe all-formed, golden Illuminer, the supreme way, the light, the fervent one.\nThousand-rayed, turning in a hundred ways, the Life of beings, this sun rises.\n\nThe year is a Lord of beings. His two paths are the southern and the northern.\nTherefore they who worship, thinking that it is fulfilled by sacrifice and\ngifts, win the lunar world. They verily return again. Therefore these sages\nwho desire beings, turn to the south. For this is the path of Substance, the\npath of the fathers.\n\np. 31\n\nBut they who by the northern way seek the Self by fervour, service of the\nEternal, faith and knowledge, they verily win the sun. This is the home of\nlives; this is the immortal, fearless, supreme way. From it they do not return\nagain; for this is the end.\n\nAnd there is this verse:\n\nThey call _the sun_ the father in the upper half of heaven, with five steps--\n_seasons_ --and twelve forms-- _months_ --the giver of increase.\n\nBut others call him the Seer who rests in the seven-wheeled chariot, of six\nspokes.\n\nThe month is a Lord of beings. The dark half is the Substance; the bright half\nis the Life. Therefore these Sages offer sacrifice in the bright half; but the\nothers in the other half.\n\nDay-and-night is a Lord of beings. Day verily is the Life, and night is the\nSubstance. They waste their life who find love in the outward; but service of\nthe Eternal finds love in the hidden.\n\nFood also is a Lord of beings. Thence comes this seed, and thence these beings\nare brought forth. And\n\np. 32\n\nall that follow this vow of the Lord of beings, produce a pair.\n\nTheirs verily is that world of the Eternal, who have fervour and service of\nthe Eternal, and in whom truth is set firm. Theirs is that quiet world of the\nEternal; but not theirs, in whom are crookedness, untruth, Illusion.\n\n\n\nAnd so Bhargava Vaidarbhi asked him: Master, how many are the bright ones that\nuphold being? i Which illumine this? Which of them again is chiefest?\n\nHe answered him:. Shining ether is that bright one, air, and fire, and water,\nand earth; voice, mind, sight, hearing. They, illumining, declare: We uphold\nthis ray, establishing it.\n\nAnd Life, the chiefest among them, said: Cherish not this delusion: for I,\nverily, dividing myself fivefold, uphold this ray, establishing it.\n\nThey were incredulous. Life proudly made as if to go out above. And as Life\ngoes out, all the others go out, and as Life returns, all the others return.\nAs the bees all go out after the honey-makers' king when he goes\n\np. 33\n\nout, and return when he returns, thus did voice, mind, sight, and hearing.\nJoyful, they sing the praise of Life.\n\nHe warms as fire; as sun, and the rain-god; the thunderer, wind, and the\nearth, substance, the bright one; what is, what is not, and what is immortal.\n\nLike spokes in a wheel's nave, all this rests in Life. Songs, and liturgies,\nand chants; sacrifice and warrior and priest.\n\nThou, Life, as Lord of beings, movest in the germ; and thou thyself art born\nfrom it. And to thee, Life, these beings bring the offering; thou who art set\nfirm through the lives.\n\nThou art the tongued flame of the bright ones; the first oblation of the\nfathers. Thou art the law of the sages; the truth of sacrificial priests.\n\nThou art the thunderer, Life, with his brightness; thou art the storm-god, the\npreserver. Thou movest in the mid space as the sun; thou art master of the\nstars.\n\nWhen thou descendest as rain, these thy children, Life, stand\n\np. 34\n\nrejoicing; we shall have food, they say, according to our desire.\n\nThou art the exile, Life, the lonely seer; the eater, the good master of all.\nWe are givers of the first offering. Thou art father to us, the great Breath.\n\nThy form that is manifested in voice, and in hearing, and in sight, and the\nform that expands in mind, make it auspicious! Go not out!\n\nAll this is in Life's sway, all that is set firm in the triple heaven. Guard\nus as a mother her sons; and as Fortune, give us wisdom!\n\nAnd so Kaushalya Ashvalayana asked him: Master, where is this Life born from?\nHow does it enter this body? Hew does it come forth, dividing itself? Through\nwhat does it go out? How does it envelop the outer? and how as to union with\nthe Self?\n\nHe answered him: Many questions thou askest! Thou art full of the Eternal, and\ntherefore I tell it to thee. From the Self is this Life born. And as the\nshadow beside a man,\n\np. 35\n\nthis is expanded in that. By mind's action it enters this body. And as a\nsovereign commands his lords: These villages and these villages shall ye rule\nover! Thus also Life disposes the lesser lives. For the lower powers, the\ndownward-life; in sight and hearing, in mouth and nose, the forward-life; and\nin the midst, the binding-life; this binds together the food that is offered;\nand thence the seven flames arise.\n\nIn the heart is the Self. Here are a hundred and one channels. From them a\nhundred each, and in each of these, two and seventy thousand branch-channels.\nIn these the distributing-life moves.\n\nAnd by one, the upward, rises the upward-life. It leads by holiness to a holy\nworld, by sin to a sinful world, by both, to the world of men.\n\nThe outward-life rises as the sun. It is linked with this life that dwells in\nseeing. And the potency that is in earth, entering the downward-life of man,\nestablishes it. And the shining ether is for the binding-life, and air for the\ndistributing-life.\n\nAnd radiance for the upward-life.\n\np. 36\n\n[paragraph continues] Therefore he whose radiance bas become quiescent is\nreborn through the impulses dwelling in mind. According to his thoughts, he\nenters life. And Life joined by the radiance with the Self leads him to a\nworld according to his will.\n\nHe who, thus knowing, knows Life, his being fails not, and he becomes\nimmortal.\n\nAnd there is this verse:\n\nKnowing the source, the range, the abode, the lordship of Life fivefold, and\nits union with the Self, he reaches immortality, he reaches immortality.\n\n\n\nAnd so Sauryayanin Gargya asked him: Master, how many powers sleep in the man?\nHow many wake in him? Who is the bright one that sees dreams? Whose is that\nbliss? and in whom are all these set firm?\n\nHe answered him: As, Gargya, the rays of the sun, at setting, all become one\nin his shining orb; and when he rises, they all come forth again; so all\nbecomes one in the higher bright one, mind.\n\np. 37\n\nTherefore the man hears not, nor sees nor smells, nor tastes, nor touches, nor\nspeaks, nor takes, nor enjoys, nor puts forth, nor moves. He sleeps, they say.\n\nThe life-fires verily wake in this dwelling. The household fire is the\ndownward-life. The fire of oblations is the distributing-life. And as the fire\nof offerings is brought forward from the household fire, it is the forward-\nlife.\n\nAnd the binding-life is what binds together the offerings, the outbreathing\nand inbreathing. Mind is the sacrificer, and the upward-life is the fruit of\nthe sacrifice. For it brings the sacrificer day by day to the Eternal.\n\nSo this bright one in dream enjoys greatness. The seen, as seen he beholds\nagain. What was heard, as heard he hears again. And what was enjoyed by the\nother powers, he enjoys again by the other powers. The seen and the unseen,\nheard and unheard, enjoyed and unenjoyed, real and unreal, he sees it all; as\nAll he sees it.\n\nAnd when he is wrapt by the radiance, the bright one no longer\n\np. 38\n\nsees dreams. Then within him that bliss arises. And, dear, as the birds come\nto the tree to rest, so all this comes to rest in the higher Self.\n\nEarth and earth-forms; water and water-forms; light and light-forms; air and\nair-forms; ether and ether-forms; seeing and seen; hearing and heard; smelling\nand smelled; taste and tasted; touch and touched; voice and spoken; hands and\nhandled; feet and moving; mind and minding; knowledge and knowing; personality\nand personal; imagination and imagining; radiance and enlightening; life and\nliving.\n\nFor this Self is the seer, toucher, hearer, smeller, taster, thinker, knower,\ndoer, the perceiving spirit. And this is set firm in the supreme, unchanging\nSelf.\n\nHe reaches the supreme unchanging who knows that shadowless, bodiless,\ncolourless, bright unchanging one. He, dear, becomes all-knowing, becomes the\nAll.\n\nAnd there is this verse:\n\nHe who knows the unchanging one where are set firm the perceiving self, with\nall the powers, all lives\n\np. 39\n\nand beings; he, verily, all-knowing, has entered the All.\n\nAnd so Shaivya Satyakama asked him: And he amongst men, Master, who to the end\nof his life meditates on the mystic Om; what world will he gain by it?\n\nAnd he answered him: This mystic Om, Satyakama, is for the higher and lower\nEternal. Therefore the wise man, by dwelling on this, reaches one of these: if\nhe meditates on the first measure, enlightened by it he is quickly reborn in\nthe world. The songs bring him to the world of men; there, full of fervour,\nservice of the Eternal, and faith, he enjoys greatness. And if he dwells on it\nin his mind with two measures, he is led to the middle world by the liturgies.\nHe wins the lunar world, and after enjoying brightness in the lunar world, he\nreturns again.\n\nAnd he who with three measures meditates on the mystic Om, and thereby\nmeditates on the supreme spirit, is endowed with radiance, with the sun; as a\nserpent is freed from its slough, he is, verily, freed from sin.\n\np. 40\n\nHe is led by the chants to the world of the Eternal. He beholds the indwelling\nspirit above the highest assemblage of lives.\n\nAnd there are these two verses:\n\nThe three measures are subject to death when divided; they are joined to each\nother, but not inseparable. When the outer, the middle, and the midmost forms\nare joined together, the knower is not shaken.\n\nBy the songs to this world; by the liturgies to the middle world; by the\nchants to the world the seers tell of; by meditating on the mystic 0m, the\nwise man reaches that peace, unfading, immortal, fearless, supreme.\n\nAnd so Sukeshan Bharadvaja asked him: Master, the Rajaputra. Hiranyanabha\nKausalya, coming to me, asked this question: Bharadvaja, knowest thou the\nspirit with sixteen parts? I answered the youth: I know him not; if I knew\nhim, how should I not tell thee? He withers, root and all, who speaks untruth;\ntherefore I deign not to speak untruth. He,\n\np. 41\n\nsilently, entering his chariot, departed. I ask thee where this spirit is.\n\nHe answered him: Here, verily, within the body, dear, is that spirit in which\nthe sixteen parts come forth.\n\nHe said: In whose going out shall I go out? In whose resting shall I rest\nfirm? He put forth Life; and, from Life, faith, the shining ether, air, light,\nthe waters, and the power of earth. Then mind and food, and, from food, force\nand fervour, the hymns, the words of action, and name in the worlds.\n\nAnd as these rivers, rolling ocean-wards, go to their setting on reaching the\nocean, and their name and form are lost in the ocean, they say. So the sixteen\nparts of this seer, moving spiritwards, on reaching spirit, go to their\nsetting; their name and form are lost in spirit, they say. He becomes one,\nwithout parts, and immortal.\n\nAnd there is this verse:\n\nIn whom the parts are fixed like the spokes in the nave of a wheel; knowing\nthat knowable spirit, let not death disturb you.\n\nHe said to them: So far I know\n\np. 42\n\nthat supreme Eternal. There is nothing beyond.\n\n\n\nThou art our father, inasmuch as thou hast made us cross over to the further\nshore of unwisdom, said they, honouring him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III.
