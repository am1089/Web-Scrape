Your Majesty,\n\nI see you hunt the spotted deer  \n  With shafts to end his race,  \nAs though God Shiva should appear  \n  In his immortal chase.\n\n_King_. Charioteer, the deer has led us a long chase. And even now\n\nHis neck in beauty bends  \nAs backward looks he sends  \nAt my pursuing car  \nThat threatens death from far.  \nFear shrinks to half the body small;  \nSee how he fears the arrow\'s fall!\n\nThe path he takes is strewed  \nWith blades of grass half-chewed  \nFrom jaws wide with the stress  \nOf fevered weariness.  \nHe leaps so often and so high,  \nHe does not seem to run, but fly.\n\n_(In surprise_.) Pursue as I may, I can hardly keep him in sight.\n\n_Charioteer_. Your Majesty, I have been holding the horses back because the\nground was rough. This checked us and gave the deer a lead. Now we are on\nlevel ground, and you will easily overtake him.\n\n_King_. Then let the reins hang loose.\n\n_Charioteer_. Yes, your Majesty. ( _He counterfeits rapid motion_.) Look, your\nMajesty!\n\nThe lines hang loose; the steeds unreined  \n  Dart forward with a will. p. 6  \nTheir ears are pricked; their necks are strained;  \n  Their plumes lie straight and still.  \nThey leave the rising dust behind;  \nThey seem to float upon the wind.\n\n_King_ ( _joyfully_ ). See! The horses are gaining on the deer.\n\nAs onward and onward the chariot flies,  \nThe small flashes large to my dizzy eyes.  \nWhat is cleft in twain, seems to blur and mate;  \nWhat is crooked in nature, seems to be straight.  \nThings at my side in an instant appear  \nDistant, and things in the distance, near.\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. O King, this deer belongs to the hermitage, and\nmust not be killed.\n\n_Charioteer_ ( _listening and looking_ ). Your Majesty, here are two hermits,\ncome to save the deer at the moment when your arrow was about to fall.\n\n_King_ ( _hastily_ ). Stop the chariot.\n\n_Charioteer_ , Yes, your Majesty. ( _He does so. Enter a hermit with his\npupil_.)\n\n_Hermit_ ( _lifting his hand_ ). O King, this deer belongs to the hermitage.\n\nWhy should his tender form expire,  \nAs blossoms perish in the fire?  \nHow could that gentle life endure  \nThe deadly arrow, sharp and sure?\n\nRestore your arrow to the quiver;  \nTo you were weapons lent  \nThe broken-hearted to deliver,  \nNot strike the innocent.\n\n_King_ ( _bowing low_ ). It is done. ( _He does so_.)\n\n_Hermit_ ( _joyfully_ ). A deed worthy of you, scion of Puru\'s race, and\nshining example of kings. May you beget a son to rule earth and heaven.\n\n_King_ ( _bowing low_ ). I am thankful for a Brahman\'s blessing.\n\n_The two hermits_. O King, we are on our way to gather firewood. Here, along\nthe bank of the Malini, you may see the hermitage of Father Kanva, over which\nShakuntala presides, so to speak, as guardian deity. Unless other duties\nprevent, pray enter here and receive a welcome. Besides,\n\np. 7\n\nBeholding pious hermit-rites  \nPreserved from fearful harm,  \nPerceive the profit of the scars  \nOn your protecting arm.\n\n_King_. Is the hermit father there?\n\n_The two hermits_. No, he has left his daughter to welcome guests, and has\njust gone to Somatirtha, to avert an evil fate that threatens her.\n\n_King_. Well, I will see her. She shall feel my devotion, and report it to the\nsage.\n\n_The two hermits_. Then we will go on our way. ( _Exit hermit with pupil_.)\n\n_King_. Charioteer, drive on. A sight of the pious hermitage will purify us.\n\n_Charioteer_. Yes, your Majesty. ( _He counterfeits motion again_.)\n\n_King_ ( _looking about_ ). One would know, without being told, that this is\nthe precinct of a pious grove.\n\n_Charioteer_. How so?\n\n_King_. Do you not see? Why, here\n\nAre rice-grains, dropped from bills of parrot chicks  \nBeneath the trees; and pounding-stones where sticks  \nA little almond-oil; and trustful deer  \nThat do not run away as we draw near;  \nAnd river-paths that are besprinkled yet  \nFrom trickling hermit-garments, clean and wet.\n\nBesides,\n\nThe roots of trees are washed by many a stream  \nThat breezes ruffle; and the flowers\' red gleam  \nIs dimmed by pious smoke; and fearless fawns  \nMove softly on the close-cropped forest lawns.\n\n_Charioteer_. It is all true.\n\n_King_ ( _after a little_ ). We must not disturb the hermitage. Stop here\nwhile I dismount.\n\n_Charioteer_. I am holding the reins. Dismount, your Majesty.\n\n_King_ ( _dismounts and looks at himself_ ). One should wear modest garments\non entering a hermitage. Take these jewels and the bow. ( _He gives them to\nthe charioteer_.) Before\n\np. 8\n\n[paragraph continues] I return from my visit to the hermits, have the horses\'\nbacks wet down.\n\n_Charioteer_. Yes, your Majesty. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_King_ ( _walking and looking about_ ). The hermitage! Well, I will enter. (\n_As he does so, he feels a throbbing in his arm_.)\n\nA tranquil spot! Why should I thrill?  \n  Love cannot enter there  \nYet to inevitable things  \n  Doors open everywhere.--\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. This way, girls!\n\n_King_ ( _listening_ ). I think I hear some one to the right of the grove. I\nmust find out. ( _He walks and looks about_.) Ah, here are hermit-girls, with\nwatering-pots just big enough for them to handle. They are coming in this\ndirection to water the young trees. They are charming!\n\nThe city maids, for all their pains,  \n  Seem not so sweet and good;  \nOur garden blossoms yield to these  \n  Flower-children of the wood.\n\n[paragraph continues] I will draw back into the shade and wait for them. ( _He\nstands, gazing toward them. Enter_ SHAKUNTALA _, as described, and her two\nfriends_.)\n\n_First friend_. It seems to me, dear, that Father Kanva cares more for the\nhermitage trees than he does for you. You are delicate as a jasmine blossom,\nyet he tells you to fill the trenches about the trees.\n\n_Shakuntala_. Oh, it isn\'t Father\'s bidding so much. I feel like a real sister\nto them. ( _She waters the trees_.)\n\n_Priyamvada_. Shakuntala, we have watered the trees that blossom in the\nsummer-time. Now let\'s sprinkle those whose flowering-time is past. That will\nbe a better deed, because we shall not be working for a reward.\n\n_Shakuntala_. What a pretty idea! ( _She does so_.)\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ). And this is Kanva\'s daughter, Shakuntala. ( _In\nsurprise_.) The good Father does wrong to make her wear the hermit\'s dress of\nbark.\n\nThe sage who yokes her artless charm  \n  With pious pain and grief,  \nWould try to cut the toughest vine  \n  With a soft, blue lotus-leaf.\n\np. 9\n\n[paragraph continues] Well, I will step behind a tree and see how she acts\nwith her friends. ( _He conceals himself_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_. Oh, Anusuya! Priyamvada has fastened this bark dress so tight\nthat it hurts. Please loosen it. (ANUSUYA _does so_.)\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _laughing_ ). You had better blame your own budding charms for\nthat.\n\n_King_. She is quite right.\n\nBeneath the barken dress  \nUpon the shoulder tied,  \nIn maiden loveliness  \nHer young breast seems to hide,\n\nAs when a flower amid  \nThe leaves by autumn tossed--  \nPale, withered leaves--lies hid,  \nAnd half its grace is lost.\n\n[paragraph continues] Yet in truth the bark dress is not an enemy to her\nbeauty. It serves as an added ornament. For\n\nThe meanest vesture glows  \nOn beauty that enchants:  \nThe lotus lovelier shows  \nAmid dull water-plants;\n\nThe moon in added splendour  \nShines for its spot of dark;  \nYet more the maiden slender  \nCharms in her dress of bark.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _looking ahead_ ). Oh, girls, that mango-tree is trying to tell\nme something with his branches that move in the wind like fingers. I must go\nand see him. ( _She does so_.)\n\n_Priyamvada_. There, Shakuntala, stand right where you are a minute.\n\n_Shakuntala_. Why?\n\n_Priyamvada_. When I see you there, it looks as if a vine were clinging to the\nmango-tree.\n\n_Shakuntala_. I see why they call you the flatterer.\n\n_King_. But the flattery is true.\n\np. 10\n\nHer arms are tender shoots; her lips  \n  Are blossoms red and warm;  \nBewitching youth begins to flower  \n  In beauty on her form.\n\n_Anusuya_. Oh, Shakuntala! Here is the jasmine-vine that you named Light of\nthe Grove. She has chosen the mango-tree as her husband.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _approaches and looks at it, joyfully_ ). What a pretty pair\nthey make. The jasmine shows her youth in her fresh flowers, and the mango-\ntree shows his strength in his ripening fruit. ( _She stands gazing at them_.)\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _smiling_ ). Anusuya, do you know why Shakuntala looks so hard\nat the Light of the Grove?\n\n_Anusuya_. No. Why?\n\n_Priyamvada_. She is thinking how the Light of the Grove has found a good\ntree, and hoping that she will meet a fine lover.\n\n_Shakuntala_. That\'s what you want for yourself. ( _She tips her watering-\npot_.)\n\n_Anusuya_. Look, Shakuntala! Here is the spring-creeper that Father Kanva\ntended with his own hands--just as he did you. You are forgetting her.\n\n_Shakuntala_. I\'d forget myself sooner. ( _She goes to the creeper and looks\nat it, joyfully_.) Wonderful! Wonderful! Priyamvada, I have something pleasant\nto tell you. Priyamvada. What is it, dear?\n\n_Shakuntala_. It is out of season, but the spring-creeper is covered with buds\ndown to the very root.\n\n_The two friends_ ( _running up_ ). Really?\n\n_Shakuntala_. Of course. Can\'t you see?\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _looking at it joyfully_ ). And I have something pleasant to\ntell you. You are to be married soon.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _snappishly_ ). You know that\'s just what you want for\nyourself.\n\n_Priyamvada_. I\'m not teasing. I really heard Father Kanva say that this\nflowering vine was to be a symbol of your coming happiness.\n\n_Anusuya_. Priyamvada, that is why Shakuntala waters the spring-creeper so\nlovingly.\n\n_Shakuntala_. She is my sister. Why shouldn\'t I give her water? ( _She tips\nher watering-pot_.)\n\np. 11\n\n_King_. May I hope that she is the hermit\'s daughter by a mother of a\ndifferent caste? But it must be so.\n\nSurely, she may become a warrior\'s bride;  \n  Else, why these longings in an honest mind?  \nThe motions of a blameless heart decide  \n  Of right and wrong, when reason leaves us blind.\n\n[paragraph continues] Yet I will learn the whole truth.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _excitedly_ ). Oh, oh! A bee has left the jasmine-vine and is\nflying into my face. ( _She shows herself annoyed by the bee_.)\n\n_King_ ( _ardently_ ).\n\nAs the bee about her flies,  \nSwiftly her bewitching eyes  \n  Turn to watch his flight.  \nShe is practising to-day  \nCoquetry and glances\' play  \n  Not from love, but fright.\n\n( _Jealously_.)\n\nEager bee, you lightly skim  \nO\'er the eyelid\'s trembling rim  \n  Toward the cheek aquiver.  \nGently buzzing round her cheek,  \nWhispering in her ear, you seek  \n  Secrets to deliver.\n\nWhile her hands that way and this  \n  Strike at you, you steal a kiss,  \nLove\'s all, honeymaker.  \nI know nothing but her name,  \nNot her caste, nor whence she came--  \n  You, my rival, take her.\n\n_Shakuntala_. Oh, girls! Save me from this dreadful bee!\n\n_The two friends_ ( _smiling_ ). Who are we, that we should save you? Call\nupon Dushyanta. For pious groves are in the protection of the king.\n\n_King_. A good opportunity to present myself. Have no--( _He checks himself.\nAside_.) No, they would see that I am the king. I prefer to appear as a guest.\n\n_Shakuntala_. He doesn\'t leave me alone! I am going to\n\np. 12\n\nrun away. ( _She takes a step and looks about_.) Oh, dear! Oh, dear! He is\nfollowing me. Please save me.\n\n_King_ ( _hastening forward_ ). Ah!\n\nA king of Puru\'s mighty line  \n  Chastises shameless churls;  \nWhat insolent is he who baits  \n  These artless hermit-girls?\n\n( _The girls are a little flurried on seeing the king_.)\n\n_Anusuya_. It is nothing very dreadful, sir. But our friend ( _indicating_\nSHAKUNTALA) was teased and frightened by a bee. __\n\n_King_ ( _to_ SHAKUNTALA). I hope these pious days are happy ones.\n(SHAKUNTALA\'S _eyes drop in embarrassment_.)\n\n_Anusuya_. Yes, now that we receive such a distinguished guest.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Welcome, sir. Go to the cottage, Shakuntala, and bring fruit.\nThis water will do to wash the feet.\n\n_King_. Your courteous words are enough to make me feel at home.\n\n_Anusuya_. Then, sir, pray sit down and rest on this shady bench.\n\n_King_. You, too, are surely wearied by your pious task. Pray be seated a\nmoment.\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _aside to_ SHAKUNTALA). My dear, we must be polite to our\nguest. Shall we sit down? ( _The three girls sit_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _to herself_ ). Oh, why do I have such feelings when I see this\nman? They seem wrong in a hermitage.\n\n_King_ ( _looking at the girls_ ). It is delightful to see your friendship.\nFor you are all young and beautiful.\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _aside to_ ANUSUYA). Who is he, dear? With his mystery, and his\ndignity, and his courtesy? He acts like a king and a gentleman.\n\n_Anusuya_. I am curious too. I am going to ask him. ( _Aloud_.) Sir, you are\nso very courteous that I make bold to ask you something. What royal family do\nyou adorn, sir? What country is grieving at your absence? Why does a gentleman\nso delicately bred submit to the weary journey into our pious grove?\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _aside_ ). Be brave, my heart. Anusuya speaks your very\nthoughts.\n\n_King_ ( _aside_ ). Shall I tell at once who I am, or conceal it? ( _He\nreflects_.) This will do. ( _Aloud_.) I am a student of Scripture.\n\np. 13\n\n[paragraph continues] It is my duty to see justice done in the cities of the\nking. And I have come to this hermitage on a tour of inspection.\n\n_Anusuya_. Then we of the hermitage have some one to take care of us.\n(SHAKUNTALA _shows embarrassment_.)\n\n_The two friends_ ( _observing the demeanour of the pair_. _Aside to_\nSHAKUNTALA). Oh, Shakuntala! If only Father were here to-day.\n\n_Shakuntala_. What would he do?\n\n_The two friends_. He would make our distinguished guest happy, if it took his\nmost precious treasure.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _feigning anger_ ). Go away! You mean something. I\'ll not\nlisten to you.\n\n_King_. I too would like to ask a question about your friend.\n\n_The two friends_. Sir, your request is a favour to us.\n\n_King_. Father Kanva lives a lifelong hermit. Yet you say that your friend is\nhis daughter. How can that be?\n\n_Anusuya_. Listen, sir. There is a majestic royal sage named Kaushika------\n\n_King_. Ah, yes. The famous Kaushika.\n\n_Anusuya_. Know, then, that he is the source of our friend\'s being. But Father\nKanva is her real father, because he took care of her when she was abandoned.\n\n_King_. You waken my curiosity with the word "abandoned." May I hear the whole\nstory?\n\n_Anusuya_. Listen, sir. Many years ago, that royal sage was leading a life of\nstern austerities, and the gods, becoming strangely jealous, sent the nymph\nMenaka to disturb his devotions.\n\n_King_. Yes, the gods feel this jealousy toward the austerities of others. And\nthen------\n\n_Anusuya_. Then in the lovely spring-time he saw her intoxicating beauty------\n(She stops in embarrassment.)\n\n_King_. The rest is plain. Surely, she is the daughter of the nymph.\n\n_Anusuya_. Yes.\n\n_King_. It is as it should be.\n\nTo beauty such as this  \n  No woman could give birth;  \nThe quivering lightning flash  \n  Is not a child of earth.\n\n(SHAKUNTALA _hangs her head in confusion_.)\n\np. 14\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ). Ah, my wishes become hopes.\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _looking with a smile at_ SHAKUNTALA). Sir, it seems as if you\nhad more to say. (SHAKUNTALA _threatens her friend with her finger_.)\n\n_King_. You are right. Your pious life interests me, and I have another\nquestion.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Do not hesitate. We hermit people stand ready to answer all\ndemands.\n\n_King_. My question is this:\n\nDoes she, till marriage only, keep her vow  \nAs hermit-maid, that shames the ways of love?  \nOr must her soft eyes ever see, as now,  \nSoft eyes of friendly deer in peaceful grove?\n\n_Priyamvada_. Sir, we are under bonds to lead a life of virtue. But it is her\nfather\'s wish to give her to a suitable lover.\n\n_King_ ( _joyfully to himself_ ).\n\nO heart, your wish is won!  \nAll doubt at last is done;  \nThe thing you feared as fire,  \nIs the jewel of your desire.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _pettishly_ ). Anusuya, I\'m going.\n\n_Anusuya_. What for?\n\n_Shakuntala_. I am going to tell Mother Gautami that Priyamvada is talking\nnonsense. ( _She rises_.)\n\n_Anusuya_. My dear, we hermit people cannot neglect to entertain a\ndistinguished guest, and go wandering about.\n\n(SHAKUNTALA _starts to walk away without answering_.)\n\n_King_ ( _aside_ ). She is going! ( _He starts up as if to detain her, then\nchecks his desires_.) A thought is as vivid as an act, to a lover.\n\nThough nurture, conquering nature, holds  \nMe back, it seems  \nAs had I started and returned  \nIn waking dreams.\n\n_Priyamvada_ ( _approaching_ SHAKUNTALA). You dear, peevish girl! You mustn\'t\ngo.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _turns with a frown_ ). Why not?\n\n_Priyamvada_. You owe me the watering of two trees. You\n\np. 15\n\ncan go when you have paid your debt. ( _She forces her to come back_.)\n\n_King_. It is plain that she is already wearied by watering the trees. See!\n\nHer shoulders droop; her palms are reddened yet;  \n  Quick breaths are struggling in her bosom fair;  \nThe blossom o\'er her ear hangs limply wet;  \n  One hand restrains the loose, dishevelled hair.\n\n[paragraph continues] I therefore remit her debt. ( _He gives the two friends\na ring. They take it, read the name engraved on it, and look at each other_.)\n\n_King_. Make no mistake. This is a present--from the king.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Then, sir, you ought not to part with it. Your word is enough to\nremit the debt.\n\n_Anusuya_. Well, Shakuntala, you are set free by this kind gentleman--or\nrather, by the king himself. Where are you going now?\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _to herself_ ). I would never leave him if I could help myself.\n\n_Priyamvada_. Why don\'t you go now?\n\n_Shakuntala_. I am not your servant any longer. I will go when I like.\n\n_King_ ( _looking at_ SHAKUNTALA. _To himself_ ). Does she feel toward me as I\ndo toward her? At least, there is ground for hope.\n\nAlthough she does not speak to me,  \n  She listens while I speak;  \nHer eyes turn not to see my face,  \n  But nothing else they seek.\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. Hermits! Hermits! Prepare to defend the creatures\nin our pious grove. King Dushyanta is hunting in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe dust his horses\' hoofs have raised,  \n  Red as the evening sky,  \nFalls like a locust-swarm on boughs  \n  Where hanging garments dry.\n\n_King_ ( _aside_ ). Alas! My soldiers are disturbing the pious grove in their\nsearch for me.\n\np. 16\n\n_The voice behind the scenes_. Hermits! Hermits! Here is an elephant who is\nterrifying old men, women, and children.\n\nOne tusk is splintered by a cruel blow  \nAgainst a blocking tree; his gait is slow,  \nFor countless fettering vines impede and cling;  \nHe puts the deer to flight; some evil thing  \nHe seems, that comes our peaceful life to mar,  \nFleeing in terror from the royal car.\n\n( _The girls listen and rise anxiously_.)\n\n_King_. I have offended sadly against the hermits. I must go back.\n\n_The two friends_. Your Honour, we are frightened by this alarm of the\nelephant. Permit us to return to the cottage.\n\n_Anusuya_ ( _to_ SHAKUNTALA). Shakuntala dear, Mother Gautami will be anxious.\nWe must hurry and find her.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _feigning lameness_ ). Oh, oh! I can hardly walk.\n\n_King_. You must go very slowly. And I will take pains that the hermitage is\nnot disturbed.\n\n_The two friends_. Your honour, we feel as if we knew you very well. Pray\npardon our shortcomings as hostesses. May we ask you to seek better\nentertainment from us another time?\n\n_King_. You are too modest. I feel honoured by the mere sight of you.\n\n_Shakuntala_. Anusuya, my foot is cut on a sharp blade of grass, and my dress\nis caught on an amaranth twig. Wait for me while I loosen it. ( _She casts a\nlingering glance at the king, and goes out with her two friends_.)\n\n_King_ ( _sighing_ ). They are gone. And I must go. The sight of Shakuntala\nhas made me dread the return to the city. I will make my men camp at a\ndistance from the pious grove. But I cannot turn my own thoughts from\nShakuntala.\n\nIt is my body leaves my love, not I;  \nMy body moves away, but not my mind;  \nFor back to her my struggling fancies fly  \nLike silken banners borne against the wind. ( _Exit_.)\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Act II. The Secret](sha06.htm)\n\n'
