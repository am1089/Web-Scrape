Pra _g_ apati's eye swelled; it fell out: thence the horse was\nproduced; and inasmuch as it swelled (a _s_ vayat), that is the origin and\nnature of the horse (a _s_ va). By means of the A _s_ vamedha the gods\nrestored it to its place; and verily he who performs the A _s_ vamedha makes\nPra _g_ apati complete, and he (himself) becomes complete; and this, indeed,\nis the atonement for everything, the remedy for everything. Thereby the gods\nredeem all sin, yea, even the slaying of a Brahman 1 they thereby redeem; and\nhe who performs the A _s_ vamedha redeems all sin, he redeems the slaying of a\nBrahman.\n\n13:3:1:22\\. It was the left eye of Pra _g_ apati that swelled: hence they cut\noff the (meat) portions from the left.\n\np. 329\n\nside of the horse, and from the right side of other victims.\n\n13:3:1:33\\. There is a rattan mat, for the horse was produced from the womb of\nthe waters, and the rattan springs from the water: he thus brings it in\nconnection with its own (maternal) womb.\n\n13:3:1:44\\. The _K_ atush _t_ oma 1 is the form of chanting (on\n\np. 330\n\nthe first day); for a bee tore out 1 (a piece of) the horse's thigh, and by\nmeans of the Katush _t_ oma form of chanting the gods restored it: thus when\nthere is the Katush _t_ oma mode of chanting, it is for the completeness of\nthe horse. The last day is an Atiratra with all the Stomas 2\\--with a view to\nhis obtaining and securing everything, for an Atiratra with all the Stomas is\neverything, and the A _s_ vamedha is everything.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[328:1](sbe44094.htm#fr_839) See [XIII, 3, 5, 3](sbe44098.htm#13:3:5:3) seq.\n\n[329:1](sbe44094.htm#fr_840) The term Katush _t_ oma originally apparently\nmeans a sacrificial performance, or succession of chants, in which four\ndifferent Stomas, or hymn-forms, are used. Hence, in Ta _n_ _d_ ya-Br. VI, 3,\n16, the name is applied to the ordinary Agnish _t_ oma, for its twelve\nStotras, or chants, require the first four normal Stomas (Triv _ri_ t, Pa _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ ada _s_ a, Saptada _s_ a, Ekavi _m_ _s_ a). The term has, however, assumed\nthe special meaning of a hymnic performance, the different Stomas of which\n(begin with the four-versed one, and) successively increase by four verses\n(cf. [XIII, 5, 1, 1](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:1)). In this sense, two different\nforms of _K_ atush _t_ oma are in use, one being applicable to an Agnish _t_\noma, the other to a Sho _d_ a _s_ in, sacrifice. Whilst this latter form\nrequires only four different Stomas (of 4, 8, 12, 16 verses resp.) and thus\ncombines the original meaning of ' _k_ atush _t_ oma' with its special\nmeaning, the Agnish _t_ oma form, used on the first of the three days of the A\n_s_ vamedha, requires six Stomas, ascending from the four-versed up to the\ntwenty-four-versed one. In regard to this latter occasion, Saya _n_ a on Ta\n_n_ _d_ ya-Br. XXI, 4, 1, curiously enough, seems to take 'katush _t_ oma' in\nits original senses, since he speaks of this first day of the A _s_ vamedha as\nan Agnish _t_ oma with four Stomas, beginning with Triv _ri_ t; whilst on ib.\nXIX, 5, 1 seq. he gives the correct explanation. As to the distribution of the\nsix Stomas over the chants of the first day, see [XIII, 5, 1,\n1](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:1). The _k_ atush _t_ oma has, however, another\npeculiarity, which, in La _t_ y. S. VI, 8, 1 (or at least by the commentator\nAgnisvamin thereon), is taken as that which has given its name to this form of\nchanting, viz. that each stotra performed in it is chanted in four, instead of\nthe ordinary three, paryayas or turns of verses (see part ii, p. 350 note).\nThe Bahishpavamana-stotra is to be performed on three anush _t_ ubh verses\n(consisting each of four octosyllabic padas) which, however, by taking each\ntime three padas to make up a verse, are transformed into four verses,\nconstituting at the same time the four paryayas of the Stotra. As regards the\nexact p. 330 text to be used there seems to be some doubt, Samav. S. II, 366-8\n(pavasva va _g_ asataye) being mentioned by Saya _n_ a on Ta _n_ _d_ ya-Br.\nXXI, 4, 5; whilst on XIX, 5, 2 he gives S. V. II, 168-70 (ayam pusha rayir\nbhaga _h_ ) as the text to be used--but apparently only when the performance\nis that of an ekaha (one day's sacrifice) proper, instead of one of the days\nof an ahina sacrifice, as is the case in the three days' A _s_ vamedha. As\nregards the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya-stotras to be chanted on the eight-versed Stoma, the text\nof each of them consists of three gayatri-verses: these are to be chanted in\nfour turns (paryaya) of two verses each, viz. either 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 1 and\n2, 2 and 3;--or 1 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 2, 3 and 3;--(or 1 and 1, 1 and 1, 2\nand 2, 3 and 3;--or 1 and 1, 2 and 2, 2 and 2, 3 and 3). By similar\nmanipulations the subsequent Stomas are formed.\n\n[330:1](sbe44094.htm#fr_841) Or, wounded, as Saya _n_ a takes 'a b _ri_ hat,'\non Ta _n_ _d_ ya-Br. XXI, 4, 4 (vra _n_ a _m_ _k_ akara).\n\n[330:2](sbe44094.htm#fr_842) The Atiratra sarvastoma is arranged in such a way\nthat the six principal Stomas are used successively first in the ascending,\nand then again in the descending, or reversed, order as is explained in [XIII,\n5, 3, 10](sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:10).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 3, 2.
