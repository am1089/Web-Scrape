Most European scholars are\nagreed in deriving\n\np. lxxx\n\nupa-ni-shad from the root sad, to sit down, preceded by the two prepositions\nni, down, and upa, near, so that it would express the idea of session, or\nassembly of pupils sitting down near their teacher to listen to his\ninstruction. In the Trika _n_ _d_ a _s_ esha, upanishad is explained by\nsamipasadana, sitting down near a person 1.\n\nSuch a word, however, would have been applicable, it would seem, to any other\nportion of the Veda as well as to the chapters called Upanishad, and it has\nnever been explained how its meaning came thus to be restricted. It is still\nmore strange that upanishad, in the sense of session or assembly, has never,\nso far as I am aware, been met with. Whenever the word occurs, it has the\nmeaning of doctrine, secret doctrine, or is simply used as the title of the\nphilosophic treatises which constitute the _g_ \xc3\xb1anaka _n_ _d_ a, the knowledge\nportion, as opposed to the karmaka _n_ _d_ a, the work or ceremonial portion,\nof the Veda.\n\nNative philosophers seem never to have thought of deriving upanishad from sad,\nto sit down. They derive it either from the root sad, in the sense of\ndestruction, supposing these ancient treatises to have received their name\nbecause they were intended to destroy passion and ignorance by means of divine\nrevelation 2, or from the root sad, in the sense of approaching, because a\nknowledge of Brahman comes near to us by means of the Upanishads, or because\nwe approach Brahman by their help. Another explanation proposed by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara\nin his commentary on the Taittiriya-upanishad II, 9, is that the highest bliss\nis contained in the Upanishad (para _m_ _s_ reyo 'sya _m_ nisha _n_ _n_ am).\n\nThese explanations seem so wilfully perverse that it is difficult to\nunderstand the unanimity of native scholars. We ought to take into account,\nhowever, that very general tendency among half-educated people, to acquiesce\nin any etymology which accounts for the most prevalent meaning of a word. The\n\xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas abound in\n\np. lxxxi\n\nsuch etymologies, which probably were never intended as real etymologies, in\nour sense of the word, but simply as plays on words, helping to account\nsomehow for their meaning. The Upanishads, no doubt, were meant to destroy\nignorance and passion, and nothing seemed more natural therefore than that\ntheir etymological meaning should be that of destroyers 1.\n\nThe history and the genius of the Sanskrit language leave little doubt that\nupanishad meant originally session, particularly a session consisting of\npupils, assembled at a respectful distance round their teacher.\n\nWith upa alone, sad occurs as early as the hymns of the Rig-veda, in the sense\nof approaching respectfully 2:--\n\nRig-veda IX, 11, 6. Namasa it upa sidata, 'approach him with praise.' See also\nRig-veda X, 73, II; I, 65, I.\n\nIn the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad VI, 13, I, a teacher says to his pupil, atha ma\npratar upasidatha _h_ , 'come to me (for advice) to-morrow morning.'\n\nIn the same Upanishad VII, 8, I, a distinction is made between those who serve\ntheir teachers (pari _k_ arita), and those who are admitted to their more\nintimate society (upasatta, comm. samipaga _h_ , antara\xe1\xb9\x85ga _h_ , priya _h_ ).\n\nAgain, in the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad VII, I, we read of a pupil approaching\nhis teacher (upasasada or upasasada), and of the teacher telling him to\napproach with what he knows, i.e. to tell him first what he has learnt already\n(yad vettha tena mopasida 3).\n\nIn the Sutras (Gobhiliya G _ri_ hya-sutra II, 10, 38) upasad is the recognised\nterm for the position assumed by a pupil with his hands folded and his eyes\nlooking up to the teacher who is to instruct him.\n\nIt should be stated, however, that no passage has yet been met with in which\nupa-ni-sad is used in the sense of pupils approaching and listening to their\nteacher. In the\n\np. lxxxii\n\nonly passage in which upanishasada occurs (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 2, 1), it is used of\nIndra sitting down by the side of Vi _s_ vamitra, and it is curious to observe\nthat both MSS. and commentaries give here upanishasasada, an entirely\nirregular form.\n\nThe same is the case with two other roots which are used almost synonymously\nwith sad, viz. as and vi _s_. We find upa + as used to express the position\nwhich the pupil occupies when listening to his teacher, e _g_. Pa _n_. III, 4,\n72, upasito gurum bhavan, 'thou hast approached the Guru,' or upasito gurur\nbhavata, 'the Guru has been approached by thee.' We find pari + upa + as used\nwith regard to relations assembled round the bed of a dying friend, _Kh_ and.\nUp. VI, 15; or of hungry children sitting round their mother, and likened to\npeople performing the Agnihotra sacrifice ( _Kh_ and. Up. V, 24, 5). But I\nhave never met with upa-ni-as in that sense.\n\nWe likewise find upa-vis used in the sense of sitting down to a discussion (\n_Kh_ and. Up. I, 8, 2), but I have never found upa + ni + vis as applied to a\npupil listening to his teacher.\n\nThe two prepositions upa and ni occur, however, with pat, to fly, in the sense\nof flying down and settling near a person, _Kh_ and. Up. IV, 7, 2; IV, 8, 2.\nAnd the same prepositions joined to the verb _s_ ri, impart to it the meaning\nof sitting down beneath a person, so as to show him respect: B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. I,\n4, II. 'Although a king is exalted, he sits down at the end of the sacrifice\nbelow the Brahman,' brahmaivantata upani _s_ rayati.\n\nSad, with upa and ni, occurs in upanishadin only, and has there the meaning of\nsubject, e _g_. Satap. Brahm. IX, 4, 3, 3, kshatraya tad vi _s_ am adhastad\nupanishadini _m_ karoti, 'he thus makes the Vi _s_ (citizen) below, subject to\nthe Kshatriya.'\n\nSometimes nishad is used by the side of upanishad, and so far as we can judge,\nwithout any difference of meaning 1.\n\nAll we can say therefore, for the present, is that upanishad,\n\np. lxxxiii\n\nbesides being the recognised title of certain philosophical treatises, occurs\nalso in the sense of doctrine and of secret doctrine, and that it seems to\nhave assumed this meaning from having been used originally in the sense of\nsession or assembly in which one or more pupils receive instruction from a\nteacher.\n\nThus we find the word upanishad used in the Upanishads themselves in the\nfollowing meanings:\n\n1\\. Secret or esoteric explanation, whether true or false.\n\n2\\. Knowledge derived from such explanation.\n\n3\\. Special rules or observances incumbent on those who have received such\nknowledge.\n\n4\\. Title of the books containing such knowledge.\n\nI. Ait. \xc3\x82r. III, 1, 6, 3. 'For this Upanishad, i.e. in order to obtain the\ninformation about the true meaning of Sa _m_ hita, Tarukshya served as a\ncowherd for a whole year.'\n\nTaitt. Up. 1, 3. 'We shall now explain the Upanishad of the Sa _m_ hita.'\n\nAit. \xc3\x82r. III, 2, 5, 1. 'Next follows this Upanishad of the whole speech. True,\nall these are Upanishads of the whole speech, but this they declare\nespecially.'\n\nTalav. Up. IV, 7. 'As you have asked me to tell you the Upanishad, the\nUpanishad has now been told you. We have told you the Brahmi Upanishad,' i.e.\nthe true meaning of Brahman.\n\nIn the _Kh_ and. Up. III, II, 3, after the meaning of Brahman has been\nexplained, the text says: 'To him who thus knows this Brahma upanishad (the\nsecret doctrine of Brahman) the sun does not rise and does not set.' In the\nnext paragraph brahma itself is used, meaning either Brahman as the object\ntaught in the Upanishad, or, by a slight change of meaning, the Upanishad\nitself.\n\n_Kh_ and. Up. I, 13, 4. 'Speech yields its milk to him who knows this\nUpanishad (secret doctrine) of the Samans in this wise.'\n\n_Kh_ and. Up. VIII, 8, 4. When Indra and Virokana had both misunderstood the\nteaching of Pragapati, he says: 'They both go away without having perceived\nand without having known the Self, and whoever of these two, whether\n\np. lxxxiv\n\nDevas or Asuras, will follow this doctrine (upanishad), will perish.'\n\nII. In the _Kh_ and. Up. I, i, after the deeper meaning of the Udgitha or Om\nhas been described, the advantage of knowing that deeper meaning is put\nforward, and it is said that the sacrifice which a man performs with\nknowledge, with faith, and with the Upanishad, i.e. with an understanding of\nits deeper meaning, is more powerful.\n\nIII. In the Taittiriya-upanishad, at the end of the second chapter, called the\nBrahmanandavalli, and again at the end of the tenth chapter, the text itself\nsays: Ity upanishad, this is the Upanishad, the true doctrine.'\n\nIV. In the Kaushitaki-upanishad II, I; 2, we read: 'Let him not beg, this is\nthe Upanishad for him who knows this.' Here upanishad stands for vrata or\nrahasya-vrata, rule.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lxxx:1](sbe01015.htm#fr_40) Panini I, 4, 79, has upanishatk _ri_ tya.\n\n[lxxx:2](sbe01015.htm#fr_41) M.
