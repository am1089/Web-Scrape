Now it\nchanced that as a lion was eating meat a bone stuck in his throat. The throat\nbecame swollen, he could not take food, his suffering was terrible. The crane\nseeing him, as he was perched on a tree looking for food, asked, "What ails\nthee, friend?" He told him why. "I could free thee from that bone, friend, but\ndare not enter thy mouth for fear thou mightest eat me." "Don\'t be afraid,\nfriend, I\'ll not eat thee; only save my life." "Very well," says he, and\ncaused him to lie down on his left side. But thinking to himself, "Who knows\nwhat this fellow will do?" he placed a small stick upright between his two\njaws that he could not close his mouth, and inserting his head inside his\nmouth struck one end of the bone with his beak. Whereupon the bone dropped and\nfell out. As soon as he had caused the bone to fall, he got out of the lion\'s\nmouth, striking the stick with his beak so that it fell out, and then settled\non a branch. The lion gets well, and one day was eating a buffalo he had\nkilled. The crane, thinking \'I will sound him," settled on a branch just over\nhim, and in conversation spoke this first verse:\n\n"A service have we done thee  \nTo the best of our ability,  \nKing of the Beasts! Your Majesty!  \nWhat return shall we get from thee?"\n\nIn reply the Lion spoke the second verse:\n\n"As I feed on blood,  \nAnd always hunt for prey,  \n\'Tis much that thou art still alive  \nHaving once been between my teeth."\n\nThen in reply the crane said the two other verses:\n\n"Ungrateful, doing no good,  \nNot doing as he would be done by,  \nIn him there is no gratitude,  \nTo serve him is useless.\n\n"His friendship is not won  \nBy the clearest good deed.  \nBetter softly withdraw from him,  \nNeither envying nor abushing."\n\nAnd having thus spoken the crane flew away.\n\n_\n\n  \nAnd when the great Teacher, Gautama the Buddha, told this tale, he used to\nadd:_ " _Now at that time the lion was Devadatta the Traitor, but the white\ncrane was I myself."\n\n_\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: How the Raja\'s Son won the Princess Labam](ift03.htm)\n\n'
