There will be two benefits in this\nblending\xc2\x97more success in the outer world and more peace in the inner life. The\ntime has gone for any of us\xc2\x97East or West\xc2\x97to think of Occultism as an escape\nfrom material reality and responsibility into some vague inner condition in\nwhich one retreats from all that material life stands for. Rather it is\nconcerned in the purpose voiced by Emerson when he wrote: "To make in matter\nhome for mind." To make of this world a place where consciousness can enjoy to\nthe full all the powers of its own mind and\n\np. 4\n\nat the same time discover that there is more to the mind than is commonly\nknown\xc2\x97that is practical Occultism.\n\nTo know how the mind works we cannot do better than turn to the ancient\nwriters on what is called yoga\xc2\x97looking at _all_ the principal ancient schools\nof yoga, not only one or two of them. Of these there are seven well-known\nsurviving schools in India today, and in addition to these our survey of\nOriental Occultism would be incomplete without allusion to three others\xc2\x97the\nPersian Sufis, the Buddhist "Noble Way," and the Chinese and Japanese Zen.\nThis makes ten in all.\n\nMany are the modern teachers of practical occultism or yoga, but all of them\ncan be classed as especially devoted to the methods of one or other of these\nmodes of practice.\n\nWhy have we at the outset associated the word yoga with occultism? Because\nyoga is the practice of occult powers\xc2\x97or rather the discovery and use of those\npowers residing unseen in the depths of the human mind. The practice could\nbegin with the formula, "We are only part alive," and from that standpoint\nproceed to investigate the Introspectional Psychology of the ancients, which\nthey said united them\xc2\x97yoga means union\xc2\x97with the latent possibilities and\nunseen actualities of and beyond the mind. The\n\np. 5\n\n[paragraph continues] Introspectional Psychology, all the ancient teachers\nasserted, is justified by its results; it works.\n\nThat it should have been developed in elder times, in very peaceful times, in\nthe Orient, was very natural. In those very settled days there were whole\nclasses of society who had leisure to give to these matters. There were not\nonly solitary and silent hermit-investigators, but also teachers with small\nschools, and travelling lecturers, and occasional conferences of teachers\norganized by the ancient rulers. But nowadays we have a phase of material\nactivity, most fully developed in America and now invading the Orient itself,\nwhich leaves people with little energy or time to carry on the studies in\nIntrospectional Psychology in which many people formerly immersed\nthemselves\xc2\x97in which they were often at fault when they made the delights of\nthe mind a substitute for the valuable experience of the whole estate of man.\nThis modern activity is such that very often people have nervous breakdowns of\nvarious kinds. Many must be the material achievements left unfulfilled because\nof the collapse of those who could originate them but could not bear the\nstrain of carrying them to their completion.\n\nIt is into this field of sorrow, lit up only occasionally by success, that the\nOriental occultism can be brought for the discovery and use of the inner\nresources\n\np. 6\n\nof the mind, increasing the power and improving the machinery of thought,\nemotion and the will. That peace and power are two aspects of one principle is\none of the chief discoveries of the Oriental occultist\xc2\x97a discovery within the\nreach of all reasonable persons.\n\nIt is not to be thought, however, that the ancient teachers alluded to are\nproposing some sort of magic as a substitute for our present method of doing\nthings through the mechanism of a healthy body. That the magic exists is true,\nand there is a long list of "psychic powers" which manifest themselves in\nvarious degrees quite naturally as the process of yoga goes on, but the\nteachers mostly refer to these as not of great value, and advise against\nmaking the mind a "playground" for them. In India there are many who can\nexhibit varieties of hallucinatory or hypnotic effects, and also telepathy,\npsychometry, clairvoyance, clairaudience, levitation, astral travelling,\ntransportation and apport, and similar occult or magical arts. Indeed, some\npeople with very little education in other respects have been specially\ntrained in one or more of these faculties and powers, so that they are able to\nastonish the tourist and earn a living by exhibiting these feats. But the real\nyog\xc4\xabs are not interested in these. They are interested in mastering\nenvironment and finding the ethical and spiritual forces and experiences\n\np. 7\n\nwhich are not only immature but positively infantile in most people.\n\nIt will be asked: "Why do not these more perfect men use both the higher\npowers and the magics?" The answer is, "They do. They use these constantly,\nbut they do not display them, for they know that very many persons would be\ntempted out of the regular course of their evolution by the glamour of these\nfaculties and powers. And many would use them as only another additional means\nfor exploiting their fellow men." As to such matters as applying a healing\ninfluence for body and mind\xc2\x97these can be as well used in silence as with any\ndisplay. I remember that one very respected Hindu occultist, when questioned\non this point said that if highly successful and convincing demonstrations of\nthe occult powers were given, most people would be overcome by modesty and\nwould want to lean upon the demonstrator, others would be frightened, others\nwould call it the work of the devil, and some who had not seen for themselves\nwould call it all a fraud\xc2\x97but on the other hand those who sincerely practice\nthe yoga will invariably have before long some convincing experiences of their\nown, useful for their own private encouragement and essential benefit.\n\nIn my book _The Occult Training of the Hindus_ , published some years ago in\nMadras, and recently\n\np. 8\n\nreprinted there, I presented a brief survey of this subject, resulting from my\nlong residence in India, during which I was chiefly interested in studying\nthese matters. In that book I have told of my acquaintance and friendship with\nmany of these exponents of yoga, and how I thus learned that all over the\ncountry there are tens of thousands of people who give part of their day to\nthe pursuit of the methods of the ancient occult teachers, although they are\nengaged in modern occupations. There is in India, I would say, a vein of\npracticality in these matters which most Western persons just do not\nunderstand.\n\nIn the present small volume, intended to bring these matters more to the\nattention of the West, I am making use again of much of the material in that\nbook, without feeling it necessary to employ quotation marks. This has been\ndone considerably in Chapters 2 to 6. Chapters 7 to 9 are entirely newly\nwritten.\n\nLet us begin then with the statement that the seven well-known varieties of\nyoga practice among the Hindus can be listed as follows:\xc2\x97\n\n1\\. The R\xc4\x81ja Yoga of Patanjali.\n\n2\\. The Karma and Buddhi Yoga of Shr\xc4\xab Krishna.\n\n3\\. The Gny\xc4\x81na Yoga of Shr\xc4\xab Shankar\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81rya.\n\n4\\. Hatha Yoga.\n\n5\\. Laya Yoga.\n\n6\\. Bhakti Yoga.\n\n7\\. Mantra Yoga.\n\np. 9\n\nThese seven can be classified in two groups\xc2\x97the first three being called\nvarieties of _r \xc4\x81ja-yoga_ and the last four varieties of _hatha-yoga_. The\nadjective _r \xc4\x81ja_ means "kingly" because the man becomes king or master of his\nown faculties. The last four emphasize the importance of material aids, by\nworking largely on the outside or on the "terrestrial man," which is composed\nof the body along with its bundle of habitual emotions and memories and\nknowledge.\n\nThe _r \xc4\x81ja-yog\xc4\xab_ maintains that the inner powers of the mind can never be\nenhanced by any external means, but only by their own exercise.\n\nHere the law of growth from within is paramount. By the use of thought,\nthought grows. This is true also of love and the will. There is no other way\nin which these growths can be obtained. A realization of this fact sets the\nnovice on his own feet, and cures him at the outset of any tendency to lean or\ndepend upon others, even upon experts and teachers he may admire.\n\nStill, this exercise can be hindered or at least made very difficult by any\nbad condition of the body in such matters as nervous disorders, irregular\nbreathing, bad balance, and undue tension. The _hatha-yog \xc4\xabs_ of the more\nintellectual kind accede to the proposition that all higher growth is from\nwithin, but still say "No _r \xc4\x81ja_ without _hatha_ " because they find that\n\np. 10\n\nbodies generally require some preparation. The thorough-going _r \xc4\x81ja-yog\xc4\xabs_\nhowever, generally reply that there is _r \xc4\x81ja_ without _hatha_ , and in fact\nthat _r \xc4\x81ja-yoga_ if properly done will itself put the body in order, for the\nmind influences the body even if the body cannot influence the mind. Still\nthere is no harm, they often add, in just a little _hatha-yoga_ as well,\nprovided that the aspirant does not fall into a state of dependence on\nanything or any person, and does not seek merely the comforts of the body,\nemotions and knowledge, or make his purpose the increase of his power with a\nview to gain in these three fields.\n\nThe term _hatha-yoga_ , when used strictly, refers specifically only to the\nfourth school on our list, for it is specially devoted to breathing practices,\ndealing with the incoming and outgoing\xc2\x97or _ha_ and _tha_ breaths. But the term\nis quite elastic and portions of the remaining three groups of teachings are\ngenerally included, to supplement the breathing exercises of the _hatha-yoga_\nschools. Inasmuch as all the four schools operate by external means they are\nall classable as in the general field of _hatha-yoga_ , as they all work on\nthe body and environment.\n\nOne of the great gains of modern yoga is that the "hair shirt" has been\nentirely given up. The new race is not afraid of the world. It does not regard\nit as evil or of the devil. Modern man can trust himself\n\np. 11\n\namidst all the lures. He can handle them and be their master. He knows his own\npowers and can very well judge the results of his use of them. He can envisage\na metaphysical goal and also be aware of the metaphysical in the physical as\nhe goes along. He feels that whatever he may gain by any exercise or\nexperience in his will, his goodwill and his intelligence is all to the good,\nquite apart from any so-called material gain, and there is no objection to\nthat in addition. If he is caught up in any interests, enthusiasms or\nexcitements\xc2\x97as he is\xc2\x97he knows not to go too far, and that he will come out of\nthem richer in character, even if a bit scarred. He knows that time will heal\nall the wounds and ripen the character. So in the field of yoga today he is\nnot in fear of missing anything, nor dependent upon a particular guide, but\nwill choose his exercises with all the natural confidence with which he can\nchoose a good cigar. He asks for information, not gifts, nor orders, and here\nthe Orient spreads it out before him for his choice. According to individual\ntemperament each will choose, and then travel in the way that suits him best.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter Two. Patanjali\'s Raja Yoga](gsoy04.htm)\n\n'
