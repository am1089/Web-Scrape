Practise righteousness, not unrighteousness; speak truth, not untruth;\nlook far, not near; look towards the Highest, not towards that which is not\nthe Highest.\n\n2\\. A Brahma _n_ a is a fire. 2\n\n3\\. For the Veda (says), 'Agni, forsooth, is a Brahma _n_ a.' 3\n\n4\\. And how is that?\n\n5\\. And it is also declared in the Ka _th_ aka, 'On that (occasion) the body\nof the Brahma _n_ a who represents the sacrificial seat is the altar, the vow\nto perform the rite is the sacrifice, the soul is the animal to be slain, the\nintellect the rope (with which the animal is bound), the mouth of (the Brahma\n_n_ a) who represents the seat is the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, in his navel (is the\nDakshi _n_ a fire), the fire in his abdomen is the Garhapatya fire, the Pra\n_n_ a is the Adhvaryu priest, the Apana, the Hot _ri_ priest, the Vyana the\nBrahman, the Samana the Udgat _ri_ priest, the organs of sensation the\nsacrificial vessels. He who knowing this offers a sacrifice to the organs\nthrough the organs.' . . . 5\n\n6\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'An offering placed in the\nmouth-fire of a Brahma _n_ a\n\np. 139\n\nwhich is rich in Veda-fuel, protects and saves the giver and (the eater)\nhimself from sin.'\n\n7\\. 'But the offering made through the mouth of a Brahma _n_ a, which is\nneither spilt nor causes pain (to sentient creatures), nor assails him (who\nmakes it), is far more excellent than an Agnihotra.' 7\n\n8\\. After performing a mental sacrifice at which meditation (takes the place\nof the sacred) fire, truthfulness (the place of) the sacred fuel, patience\n(the place of) the oblation, modesty (the place of) the sacrificial spoon,\nabstention from injuring living beings (the place of the) sacrificial cake,\ncontentment (the place of) the sacrificial post, (and a promise of) safety\ngiven to all beings which is hard to keep (the place of) the reward given to\nthe priests, a wise man goes to his (eternal) home. 8\n\n9\\. The hair of an aging man shows signs of age, (and) the teeth of an aging\nman show signs of age, (but) the desire to live and the desire for wealth do\nnot decay even in an aging man.\n\np. 140\n\n10\\. Happiness (is the portion) of that man who relinquishes (all) desire,\nwhich fools give up with difficulty, which does not diminish with age, and\nwhich is a life-long disease.\n\n11\\. Adoration to Vasish _th_ a Satayatu, the son of Mitra and Varu _n_ a and\nUrva _s_ i!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[138:2](sbe1433.htm#fr_724) **XXX**. See above, III, 10.\n\n[138:3](sbe1433.htm#fr_725) _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a I, 4, 22.\n\n[138:5](sbe1433.htm#fr_726) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita divides the passage\ninto thirteen Sutras, and connects tatra, 'on that occasion,' with the\npreceding Sutra. 'On that (occasion),' i.e. if a Brahma _n_ a is fed.\n\n[139:7](sbe1433.htm#fr_727) Manu VII, 84; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 315. K _ri_ sh\n_n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita's reading, nainam adhya _k_ ate ka ya _h_ , which occurs\nalso in B., is nonsense. I read with Bh. nainamadhyapate _k_ _k_ a yat, and\ntake adhyapatet, 'assails (the giver),' in the sense of 'troubles him by\ncausing the performance of penances, on account of mistakes committed.' Manu's\nversion, na vina _s_ yati karhi _k_ it, 'and never perishes,' is of course an\neasier one, but it seems to me doubtful whether it is older than Vasish _th_\na's.\n\n[139:8](sbe1433.htm#fr_728) The passage, which is probably a quotation from an\nUpanishad, is very corrupt in the MSS. and K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita's\ntext. I correct it as follows:\n\nDhyanagni _h_ satyopa _k_ ayana _m_ kshantyahuti _h_  \nsruva _m_ hri _h_ puro _d_ asamahi _m_ sa sa _m_ tosho  \nyupa _h_ k _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra _m_ bhutebhyo 'bhayadakshi _n_ yam iti  \nk _ri_ tva kratum manasa _m_ yati kshayam budha _h_.\n\n[paragraph continues] But I am not confident that all the difficulties have\nbeen removed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 1, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 1](sbe1434.htm)\n\n"
