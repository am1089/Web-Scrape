Next follows the Uktha 1. Verily, breath (pra _n_ a) is Uktha, for breath\nraises up (utthapayati) all this. From him who knows this, there is raised a\nwise son, knowing the Uktha; he obtains union and oneness with the Uktha.\n\n2\\. Next follows the Ya _g_ us. Verily, breath is Ya _g_ us, for all these\nbeings are joined in breath 2. For him who knows this, all beings are joined\nto procure his excellence; he obtains union and oneness with the Ya _g_ us.\n\n3\\. Next follows the Saman. Verily, breath is the Saman, for all these beings\nmeet in breath. For him who knows this, all beings meet to procure his\nexcellence; he obtains union and oneness with the Saman.\n\n4\\. Next follows the Kshatra. Verily, breath is the Kshatra, for breath is\nKshatra, i.e. breath protects (trayate) him from being hurt (ksha _n_ ito _h_\n). He who knows this, obtains Kshatra (power), which requires no protection;\nhe obtains union and oneness with Kshatra 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[195:1](sbe15091.htm#fr_570) Meditation on the hymn called uktha. On the\nuktha, as the principal part in the Mahavrata, see Kaush. Up. III, 3; Ait. \xc3\x82r.\nII, 1, 2. The uktha, yagus, saman, &c. are here represented as forms under\nwhich pra _n_ a or life, and indirectly Brahman, is to be meditated on.\n\n[195:2](sbe15091.htm#fr_571) Without life or breath nothing can join anything\nelse; therefore life is called ya _g_ us, as it were yu _g_ us.\n\n[195:3](sbe15091.htm#fr_572) Instead of Kshatram atram, another _S_ akha, i.e.\nthe Madhyandina, reads Kshatramatram, which Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga explains as, he p.\n196 obtains the nature of the Kshatra, or he obtains the Kshatra which\nprotects (Kshatram atram).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 14](sbe15092.htm)\n\n'
