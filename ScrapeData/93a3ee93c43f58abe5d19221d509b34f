When Pra _g_\napati performed the first offering, a vika\xe1\xb9\x85kata tree sprang forth from that\nplace where, after offering, he cleansed (his hands). That vika\xe1\xb9\x85kata, then, is\nthat first offering; it is that he now offers on this (fire), and he therewith\ngratifies him (Agni). [Va _g_. S. XI, 71; _Ri_ k S. VIII, 75, 15] 'From the\nfar region come thou over to the near one: do thou protect that wherein I am!'\nas the text, so its meaning.\n\n6:6:3:22\\. He then puts on an udumbara (ficus glomerata) one. The gods and the\nAsuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_ apati, strove together. Now all the\ntrees sided with the Asuras, but the udumbara tree alone did not forsake the\ngods. The gods, having conquered the Asuras, took possession of their trees.\n\n6:6:3:33\\. They said, 'Come, let us lay into the udumbara tree whatever pith,\nwhatever vital sap there is in these trees: were they then to desert us, they\nwould\n\np. 257\n\ndesert us worn out, like a milked-out cow, or like an ox that has been (tired\nout by) drawing (the cart).' Accordingly they laid into the udumbara tree what\npith and essence there was in those trees; and on account of that pith it\nmatures (fruit) equal to all the (other) trees 1: hence that (tree) is always\nmoist, always full of milky sap,--that udumbara tree, indeed, (being) all the\ntrees, is all food: he thus gratifies him (Agni) by every kind of food, and\nkindles him by all trees (kinds of wood).\n\n6:6:3:44\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 72] 'From the farthest distance,'--that is, '(from)\nwhat farthest distance there is;'--'O red-steeded, come hither!' for red,\nindeed, is Agni's horse;--'Purishya, much-loved,'--that is, 'favourable to\ncattle, dear to many;'--'O Agni, overcome thou the scorners!' that is, 'O\nAgni, overcome all evil-doers!'\n\n6:6:3:55\\. He then puts on one not cut by an axe,--that (Agni) is born when he\nis built up: it is for all (kinds of) food that he is born. Now that (wood)\nnot cut by an axe is one kind of food (for the fire): it is thereby that he\nnow gratifies him. [Va _g_. S. XI, 73; _Ri_ k S. VIII, 102, 20] 'Whatsoever\nwood we lay upon thee, O Agni, let all that be ghee unto thee, do thou relish\nthat, O youngest!' as the text, so its meaning: whatever (wood there is) not\ncut by the axe, that he makes palatable to him; and having made it food for\nhim, he sets it before him.\n\n6:6:3:66\\. He then puts on one that has lain on the ground,--he (Agni) is born\nwhen he is built up: it is for all (kinds of) food that he is born. Now that\n\np. 258\n\n[paragraph continues] (wood) which has lain on the ground is one kind of food\n(for the fire): it is thereby he now gratifies him. [Va _g_. S. XI, 74; _Ri_ k\nS. VIII, 102, 21] 'What the red ant eats, what the white ant crawls over,'--\nfor either the red ant eats it, or the white ant crawls over it;--'let all\nthat be ghee for thee, do thou relish that, O youngest!' as the text, so its\nmeaning: whatever (wood) has lain on the ground, that he makes palatable for\nhim; and having made it food for him, he sets it before him.\n\n6:6:3:77\\. The remaining (kindling-sticks) are of pala _s_ a wood (butea\nfrondosa);--the Pala _s_ a tree is the Brahman, it is by the Brahman he thus\nkindles him (Agni). And, again, why they are pala _s_ a ones--;the Pala _s_ a\ntree is Soma, and he, Soma, doubtless is the supreme offering: it is that he\nnow offers on this (fire), and by that he gratifies him (Agni).\n\n6:6:3:88\\. [He puts them on, with Va _g_. S. XI, 75-82] 'Day by day bearing\nunremittingly,'--that is, 'Day by day bringing not unmindful;'--'food to him\nlike unto a standing horse,'--that is, 'food as to a standing (resting)\nhorse;'--'we, rejoicing in wealth-thrift and sap,'--that is, 'rejoicing in\nwealth, and thrift, and sap;'--'O Agni, let not us, thy associates, suffer\ninjury!' this he says with a view that his (Agni's) associate (the Sacrificer)\nmay not suffer injury.\n\n6:6:3:99\\. 'While Agni is kindling on the earth's navel,'--that (place) where\nhe is now being kindled is indeed the navel of the earth;--'we call for great\nwealth-thrift,'--that is, 'we call for wealth and great thrift;'--'Unto him,\nthe draught-delighted,'--for he is indeed delighted (or, inebriated)\n\np. 259\n\nby the draught,--'of high praise,'--for he is indeed highly praised;--'the\nadorable'--that is, 'worthy of adoration;'--'Agni, the conqueror, overpowering\nin battles;'--for Agni is indeed a conqueror, and overpowering in battles.\n\n6:6:3:1010\\. 'Whatever aggressive armies there are, onrushing with drawn-up\nlines; whatever thieves and robbers, those I cast into thy mouth, O\nAgni.'--'Devour thou in a lump the waylayers with thy two tusks, the thieves\nwith thy teeth, and the robbers with thy jaws, O holy one!'--'What waylayers\nthere are among men, what thieves and robbers in the wood, what miscreants in\nthe lurking-places, I throw them into thy jaws.'--'Whatever man may plot\nagainst us, and whosoever may hate us, or abuse and seek to hurt us, every one\nof them burn thou to ashes!'\n\n6:6:3:1111\\. For the gods then made food of whosoever hated them, and of\nwhomsoever they hated, and gave them up to him (Agni), and thereby gratified\nhim; and this, then, became his food, and he burnt up the evil of the gods:\nand in like manner does the Sacrificer now make food of whosoever hates him,\nand of whomsoever he hates, and give them up to him (Agni), and thereby\ngratify him; and this, then, becomes his food, and he burns up the\nSacrificer's evil.\n\n6:6:3:1212\\. These eleven (kindling-sticks) he puts on for one who is not\neither a noble, or a domestic chaplain (purohita); for incomplete are those\neleven, and incomplete is he who is not either a noble, or a domestic priest.\n\n6:6:3:1313\\. Twelve (he puts on) for a noble or a domestic\n\np. 260\n\nchaplain; for those twelve are a complete whole (or everything), and he who is\neither a noble or a domestic chaplain is everything.\n\n6:6:3:1414\\. In the case of a Purohita, he puts it on, with (Va _g_. S. XI,\n80, 'Perfected is my sanctity (brahman), perfected the vigour, the strength,\nperfected the victorious power (kshatra) whose Purohita I am!'--he thus\nperfects both his sanctity and power 1.\n\n6:6:3:1515\\. And in the case of a nobleman, with (Va _g_. S. XI, 82),'I have\nraised their arms, their lustre and strength: by the spiritual power I destroy\nthe enemies, and elevate mine own (relatives)!' this he says with the view\nthat he may destroy his enemies, and elevate his own relatives. Let him put on\nboth these (kindling-sticks); for both the Brahman and the Kshatra are this\nAgni; and it is this Agni he thus kindles by those two, by the Brahman and the\nKshatra.\n\n6:6:3:1616\\. These (kindling-sticks) amount to thirteen;--thirteen months are\na year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,\nby so much food he thus gratifies him.\n\n6:6:3:1717\\. They are a span long, for Vish _n_ u, as an embryo, was a span\nlong; and this is (Agni's or Vish _n_ u's) food: he thus gratifies him with\nfood proportionate to his own body. But the food which is proportionate to\none's body satisfies, and does no injury; but what is too much that does\ninjury, and what is too little that does not satisfy. Standing he puts them on\n--the significance of this (will be explained)\n\np. 261\n\nfurther on;--and with the Svaha ('hail!'); for seed is infused here (in the\nsacrifice,--to wit,) this Agni; and were he to put on the logs unconsecrated\nby Svaha, he would injure him (Agni). Now inasmuch as they are kindling-\nsticks, they are not oblations; but inasmuch as (they are put on) with the\nSvaha, they are food, for the Svaha is food; and thus he does not injure him\n(Agni).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[257:1](sbe4147.htm#fr_496) According to Ait.
