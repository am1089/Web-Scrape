D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n#### V. Know Thy Self 1\n\nThe world then was not yet unfolded. It became unfolded in Name and Shape, so\nthat one might say, "He of this or that name is of this or that shape." So\neven now it becomes unfolded in Name and Shape, so that one may say, "He of\nthis or that name is of this or that shape." He 2 passed into it up to the\nnail-tips, as a razor might\n\np. 65\n\nbe laid in a razor-case or the All-Supporter 1 in the All-Supporter\'s nest.\nThey see Him not; for He is divided. As breathing, He is called Breath; as\nspeaking, Speech; as seeing, Sight; as hearing, Hearing; as thinking, Mind;\nthese are the names for his workings. A man who worships one or another\nthereof understands not; for He is but in division as one or another thereof.\nSo He should be worshipped as the Self; for therein do all these become one.\n\nThis Self is the track of the universe, for by it is the universe known, yea,\nas a thing may be followed up by its track. Fame and praise a man finds who\nhas such knowledge.\n\nThis Self is dearer than a son, dearer than substance, dearer than all beside,\nmore inward. If of a man who calls another than the Self dear it should be\nsaid that he will lose his darling, it may well come to pass. He should\nworship the Self only as darling; for him who worships the Self as darling his\ndarling perishes not.\n\nThey say: "Seeing that men deem that by knowledge of Brahma they shall become\nthe universe, what did Brahma know that He became the universe?"\n\nThe world forsooth was in the beginning Brahma. It knew _itself,_ "I am\nBrahma"; therefore it became the universe. And whosoever of the gods\nunderstood this also became the same;\n\np. 66\n\nlikewise of sages and of men. Seeing this, the sage V\xc4\x81madeva set it forth,\nsaying: "I have become Manu and the Sun." [1](brk34.htm#fn_22) So now likewise\nhe who knows "I am Brahma" becomes the universe. The very gods have no power\nthat he should not be so; for he becomes the Self of them.\n\nNow he who worships another godhead, saying "This is not the same as I,"\nunderstands not; he is as it were a beast belonging to the gods. Even as many\nbeasts profit a man, so each man profits the gods. It is unpleasing when one\nbeast is taken away; how much more when many are taken! Therefore it is not\npleasing to them [2](brk34.htm#fn_23) that men should know this.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[64:1](brk33.htm#fr_19) B\xe1\xb9\x9bihad-\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87yaka Upanishad, I. iv. 7-10.\n\n[64:2](brk33.htm#fr_20) Namely, the Self, or Brahma.\n\n[65:1](brk33.htm#fr_21) The Fire-God.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI: Parables](brk34.htm)\n\n'
