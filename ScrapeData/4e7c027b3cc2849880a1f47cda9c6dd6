In the morning, after he has sacrificed the (regular) morning oblation, he\nshould have the following (plants and branches of trees) fetched, viz. Darbha\ngrass, a _S_ ami (branch), Viri _n_ a grass, a (Badari branch) with fruits,\nApamarga, and _S_ irisha. He then should silently throw (a portion) of flour\nof fried barley into the fire, should cause the Brahma _n_ as to pronounce\nauspicious wishes, and should circumambulate the house, turning his right side\ntowards it, starting from the room for the (sacred) fire, striking the smoke\n(of the sacred fire) with those objects (i.e. with the plants and branches\nmentioned above).\n\n5\\. He should throw away those objects, after he has made use of them.\n\n6. 6 On solid stones he places a water-barrel with the two (Samans belonging to the verse), 'Vastoshpati' (Sama-veda I, 275) and with (that) _Ri_ _k_ (itself).\n\n7\\. Let him pour two pots of water into that barrel with this verse, 'Some\nassemble' (Sama-veda-\xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, vol. ii, p. 292, ed. Bibl. Indica).\n\n8. 8 In the evening boiled rice-grains with milk (are prepared).\n\n9\\. Of that (milk-rice) he should make an oblation with (the Mantra), 'She\nshone forth as the first' (MB. II, 2, 1).\n\n10. 10 The rest (should be performed) according to the Sthalipaka rite.\n\np. 96\n\n11\\. To the west of the fire he touches the Barhis with his two hands turned\ndownwards, and murmurs the Vyah _ri_ tis (i.e. the solemn utterances), 'In the\nKshatra I establish myself' (ibid. 2. 3).\n\n12\\. To the west of the fire he should have a layer spread out,\n\n13\\. Of northward-pointed grass,\n\n14\\. Inclined towards the north.\n\n15\\. After they have spread out on that (grass) new rugs, the householder sits\ndown (thereon) on the southern side.\n\n16\\. Then without an interval the others according to their age,\n\n17\\. And without an interval their wives, each with her children.\n\n18\\. When they are seated, the householder touches the layer (of grass) with\nhis two hands turned downwards, and murmurs the verse, 'Be soft to us, O\nEarth' (ibid. 4).\n\n19\\. When he has finished that (verse), they lie down on their right sides.\n\n20. 20 In the same way (they lie down on their right sides) three times, turning themselves towards themselves (i.e. turning round forwards, not backwards, and thus returning to their former position?).\n\n21\\. They repeat the auspicious hymns as far as they know them;\n\n22. 22 The complex of Samans called Arish _t_ a, according to some (teachers).\n\np. 97\n\n23\\. Having touched water, they may do whatever they like.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[94:1](sbe30031.htm#fr_331) 9, 1 seq.
