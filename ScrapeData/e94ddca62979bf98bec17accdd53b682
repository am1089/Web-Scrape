SURYA.\n\nSurya and Savitri are two names by which the Sun is commonly addressed in the\nVedic hymns. Sometimes one name is used exclusively, sometimes they are used\ninterchangeably, and sometimes they are used as though they represented quite\ndistinct objects. It is supposed that Savitri refers to the sun when\ninvisible; whilst Surya refers to him when he is visible to the worshippers.\nThis at any rate gives _some_ reason for the two names being employed, though\nit may not explain the case satisfactorily in every instance.\n\nAlthough the hymns in which Surya is addressed are not very numerous, his\nworship was most common in the olden time, and has continued to the present\nhour. It is to him that the Gayatri, the most sacred text of the Vedas, is\naddressed at his rising by every devout Br\xc4\x81hman. Simple in its phraseology,\nthis short verse is supposed to exert magical powers. It is as follows:--\n\n"Let us meditate on that excellent glory of the divine Vivifier;  \n May he enlighten (or stimulate) our understandings." *\n\nAs a specimen of the language employed in some of the later writings in\nreference to this verse, read the\n\np. 31\n\nfollowing few lines from the Skanda Pur\xc4\x81na":--"Nothing in the Vedas is\nsuperior to the Gayatri. No invocation is equal to the Gayatri, as no city is\nequal to Kasi (Benares). The Gayatri is the mother of the Vedas, and of\nBr\xc4\x81hmans. By repeating it a man is saved. By the power of the Gayatri the\nKshetriya\n\n[![SURYA](tn/03100.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/03100.jpg)  \nSURYA  \n\n[paragraph continues] (Warrior caste) Vishvamitra became a Br\xc4\x81hmarsi (Br\xc4\x81hman\nsaint), and even obtained such power as to be able to create a new world. What\nis there indeed that cannot be effected by the Gayatri? For the Gayatri is\nVishnu, Brahm\xc4\x81, and Siva, and the three Vedas." *\n\np. 32\n\n[paragraph continues] With promise of such blessings, it is not to be wondered\nat that the worship of Surya should continue.\n\nThe following translation * of hymns from the Rig-Veda gives a fair specimen\nof the language used in addresses to Surya\n\n"Behold the rays of Dawn, like heralds, lead on high  \n The Sun, that men may see the great all-knowing god.  \n The stars slink off like thieves, in company with Night,  \n Before the all-seeing eye, whose beams reveal his presence,  \n Gleaming like brilliant flames, to nation after nation.  \n With speed, beyond the ken of mortals, thou, O Sun!  \n Dost ever travel on, conspicuous to all.  \n Thou dost create the light, and with it dost illume  \n The universe entire; thou risest in the sight  \n Of all the race of men, and all the host of heaven.  \n Light-giving Varuna! thy piercing glance dost scan,  \n In quick succession, all this stirring, active world,  \n And penetrateth too the broad ethereal space,  \n Measuring our days and nights, and spying out all creatures.  \n Surya with flaming locks, clear-sighted god of day,  \n Thy seven ruddy mares bear on thy rushing car.  \n With these, thy self-yoked steeds, seven daughters of thy chariot  \n Onward thou dost advance. To thy refulgent orb  \n Beyond this lower gloom, and upward to the light  \n Would we ascend, O Sun! thou god among the gods."\n\nSurya, as we have already noticed, is regarded as a son of Aditi; at other\ntimes he is said to be a son of Dyaus. Ushas (the Dawn) is called his wife,\nthough in another passage he is said to be produced by the Dawn. Some texts\nstate that he is the Vivifier of all things; whilst others state that he was\nformed and made to shine by Indra, Soma, Agni, and others.\n\nFrom the character ascribed to Savitri in some hymns, it seems more natural to\nregard him as the sun shining in his strength, and Surya as the sun when\nrising and\n\np. 33\n\nsetting. Savitri is golden-eyed, * golden-handed, golden- tongued. He rides in\na chariot drawn by radiant, white-footed steeds. He illuminates the earth; his\ngolden arms stretched out to bless, infusing energy into all creatures, reach\nto the utmost ends of heaven. He is leader and king in heaven; the other gods\nfollow him, and he it is who gives them immortality. He is prayed to for\ndeliverance from sin, and to conduct the souls of the departed to the abode of\nthe righteous.\n\nIn the Pur\xc4\x81nic Age, Surya sustains quite a different character. He is there\ncalled the son of Kasyapa and Aditi. He is described as a dark-red man, with\nthree eyes and four arms: in two hands are water-lilies; with one he is\nbestowing a blessing, with the other he is encouraging his worshippers. He\nsits upon a red lotus, and rays of glory issue from his body. In addition to\nthe daily worship that is offered him by Br\xc4\x81hmans in the repetition of the\nGayatri, he is worshipped once a year by the Hindus of all castes, generally\non the first Sunday in the month of M\xc4\x81gh; and in seasons of sickness it is no\nuncommon thing for the low-caste Hindus to employ a Br\xc4\x81hman to repeat verses\nin his honour, in the hope that thus propitiated he will effect their\nrecovery.\n\nIn the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0 we find the following account of Surya. He married\nSangn\xc4\x81, the daughter of Visvakarma; who, after bearing him three children, was\nso oppressed with his brightness and glory that she was compelled to leave\nhim. Before her departure, she arranged with Chh\xc4\x81ya (Shadow) to take her\nplace. For years Surya did not notice the change of wife. But one day, in a\nfit of anger, Chh\xc4\x81ya pronounced a curse upon Yama (Death), a child of\nSangn\xc4\x81\'s, which\n\np. 34\n\nimmediately took effect. As Surya knew that no mother\'s curse could destroy\nher offspring, he looked into the matter and discovered that his wife had\nforsaken him, leaving this other woman in her place. Through the power of\nmeditation, Surya found Sangn\xc4\x81 in a forest in the form of a mare; and, in\norder that he might again enjoy her society, he changed himself into a horse.\nAfter a few years, growing tired of this arrangement, they returned in proper\nform to their own dwelling. But in order that his presence might be bearable\nto his wife, his father-in-law Visvakarma, who was the architect of the gods,\nground the Sun upon a stone, and by this means reduced his brightness by one-\neighth. The part thus ground from Surya was not wasted. From it were produced\nthe wonder-working discus of Vishnu, the trident of Siva, the lance of\nKartikeya (the god of war), and the weapons of Kuvera (the god of riches).\n\nThe "Bhavishya Pur\xc4\x81na" says, "Because there is none greater than he ( _i.e._\nSurya), nor has been, nor will be, therefore he is celebrated as the supreme\nsoul in all the Vedas." Again, "That which is the sun, and thus called light\nor effulgent power, is adorable, and must be worshipped by those who dread\nsuccessive births and deaths, and who eagerly desire beatitude." In the\n"Brahm\xc4\x81 Pur\xc4\x81na" * is a passage in which the sun is alluded to under twelve\nnames, with epithets peculiar to each, as though they were twelve distinct\nsun-deities:--\n\n"The first form of the sun is Indra, the lord of the gods, and the destroyer\nof their enemies; the second, Dhata, the creator of all things; the third,\nParjanya, residing in the clouds, and showering rain on the earth from its\nbeams; the fourth, Twasta, who dwells in all corporeal forms; the fifth,\nPushan, who gives nutriment\n\np. 35\n\nto all beings; the sixth, Aryama, who brings sacrifices to a successful\nconclusion; the seventh derives his name from almsgiving, and delights\nmendicants with gifts; the eighth is called Vivasvan, who ensures digestion;\nthe ninth, Vishnu, who constantly manifests himself for the destruction of the\nenemies of the gods; the tenth, Ansuman, who preserves the vital organs in a\nsound state; the eleventh, Varuna, who, residing in the waters, vivifies the\nuniverse; and the twelfth, Mitra, who dwells in the orb of the moon, for the\nbenefit of the three worlds. These are the twelve splendours of the sun, the\nsupreme spirit, who through them pervades the universe, and irradiates the\ninmost souls of men."\n\nSurya is said to have Aruna (Rosy), the Dawn, the son of Kasyapa and Kadru, as\nhis charioteer.\n\nAccording to the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana, Sugriva, the king of the monkey host which assisted\nR\xc4\x81ma in his great expedition to regain possession of Vita his wife, was a son\nof Surya by a monkey. According to the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata, the hero Karna also was\nthe son of this deity; and when he was in the form of a horse, he became\nfather of the Asvins, and communicated the white Yajur-Veda.\n\nWhen speaking of the planets, Surya will be noticed again under the name of\nRavi.\n\nAmong the many names and epithets by which this deity is known, the following\nare the most common:--\n\nDinakara, "The Maker of the day."\n\nBh\xc4\x81skara, "The Creator of light."\n\nVivaswat, "The Radiant one."\n\nMihira, "He who waters the earth;" _i.e._ he draws up the moisture from the\nseas so that the clouds are formed.\n\nGrahapati, "The Lord of the stars."\n\nKarmas\xc4\x81kshi, "The Witness of (men\'s) works."\n\nM\xc4\x81rtanda, "A descendant of Mritanda."\n\np. 36\n\n##### 2\\. PUSHAN.\n\nPushan is the name of a sun-god to whom some hymns are exclusively addressed,\nand whose praise at other times is sung in connection with that of Indra and\nother gods. In these hymns his character is not very clearly defined. He is\nsaid * to behold the entire universe; is addressed as the guide of travellers,\nand the protector of cattle. He is called upon to protect his servants in\nbattle, and to defend them as of old. He is invoked in the marriage\nceremonial, and asked to take the bride\'s hand, to lead her away, and to bless\nher in her conjugal relations. He is said also to conduct the spirits of the\ndeparted from this world to the next. In one text he is called "the\nnourisher," as Vishnu in later times was called "the preserver." By far the\ngreater number of prayers addressed to him seem to regard him as the guide and\nprotector of travellers, both along the ordinary journeys of life and in the\nlonger journey to the other world; and as he is supposed to be constantly\ntravelling about, he is said to know the road by which they have to go.\n\nThe following is a specimen of the hymns addressed to Pushan in the Rig-\nVeda:--"Conduct us, Pushan, over our road; remove distress, son of the\ndeliverer; go on before us. Smite away from before us the destructive and\ninjurious wolf which seeks after us. Drive away from our path the waylayer,\nthe thief and the robber. Tread with thy foot upon the burning weapons of that\ndeceitful wretch, whoever he be. O wonder-working and wise Pushan, we desire\nthat help of thine wherewith thou didst favour our fathers! O god, who\nbringest all blessings, and art distinguished by the golden spear,\n\np. 37\n\nmake wealth easy of acquisition! Convey us past our opponents; make our paths\neasy to travel; gain strength for us here. Lead us over a country of rich\npastures; let no new trouble (beset our) path. Bestow, satiate, grant,\nstimulate us; fill our belly. We do not reproach Pushan, we praise him with\nhymns; and we seek riches from the wonder-working god." * "May we, O Pushan!\nmeet with a wise man who will straightway direct us and say, \'It is this.\' May\nPushan follow our kine; may he protect our horses; may he give us food. . . .\nCome hither, glowing god, the deliverer, may we meet." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nIn the Pur\xc4\x81nas Pushan occupies a far less exalted position. It seems almost\nlike a burlesque to see him, who in the Vedas is reverently approached as the\ngiver of good to his worshippers, described as being obliged to feed upon\ngruel, because his teeth have been knocked out of his mouth. The earliest form\nof the legend describing this event is found in the Taittiriya Sanhita. Rudra,\nthe name by which Siva was then known, not being invited to a great sacrifice\nthat Daksha, his father-in-law, was celebrating, in his anger shot an arrow\nwhich pierced the sacrificial victim. Pushan ate his share, and in doing so\nbroke his teeth. In describing Daksha, \xe2\x80\xa1 an account of this sacrifice will be\ngiven. In the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" Pushan appears as one of the \xc4\x80dityas.\n\n##### 3\\. MITRA AND VARUNA.\n\nThese deities are most frequently named together in the hymns; Varuna is often\naddressed alone, but Mitra very seldom. The idea of the older commentators was\nthat Mitra represented and ruled over the day, whilst Varuna was ruler of the\nnight. "Varuna is sometimes\n\np. 38\n\nvisible to the gaze of his worshippers; he dwells in a house having a thousand\ndoors, so that he is ever accessible to men. He is said to have good eyesight,\nfor he knows what goes on in the hearts of men. He\n\n[![VARUNA.](tn/03800.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/03800.jpg)  \nVARUNA.  \n\nis king of gods and men; is mighty and terrible; none can resist his\nauthority. He is sovereign ruler of the universe." "It is he who makes the sun\nto shine in heaven; the winds that blow are but his breath; he has hollowed\nout the channels of the rivers which flow at\n\np. 39\n\nhis command, and he has made the depths of the sea. His ordinances are fixed\nand unassailable; through their operation the moon walks in brightness, and\nthe stars, which appear in the nightly sky, vanish in daylight. The birds\nflying in the air, the rivers in their sleepless flow, cannot attain a\nknowledge of his power and wrath. But he knows the flight of the birds in the\nsky, the course of the far travelling wind, the paths of ships on the ocean,\nand beholds all the secret things that have been or shall be done. He\nwitnesses men\'s truth and falsehood." *\n\nThe following is a metrical version of one of the hymns of the Rig-Veda as\ngiven by Dr. Muir:-- \xe2\x80\xa0\n\n"The mighty lord on high our deeds as if at hand espies;  \n The gods know all men do, though men would fain their deeds disguise:  \n Whoe\'er stands, whoe\'er moves, or steals from place to place,  \n Or hides him in his secret cell, the gods his movements trace.  \n Wherever two together plot, and deem they are alone,  \n King Varuna is there, a third, and all their schemes are known.  \n This earth is his, to him belong those vast and boundless skies,  \n Both seas within him rest, and yet in that small pool he lies.  \n Whoever far beyond the sky should think his way to win,  \n He could not there elude the grasp of Varuna the king.  \n His spies descending from the skies glide all this world around;  \n Their thousand eyes, all scanning, sweep to earth\'s remotest bound.  \n Whate\'er exists in heaven and earth, whate\'er beyond the skies,  \n Before the eye of Varuna the king unfolded lies.  \n The secret winkings all he counts of every mortal\'s eyes;  \n He wields this universal frame as gamester throws his dice.  \n Those knotted nooses which thou flingst, O god! the bad to snare,  \n All liars let them overtake, but all the truthful spare."\n\nProfessor Roth says of this hymn, "There is no hymn in the whole Vedic\nliterature which expresses the divine omniscience in such forcible terms;" and\nit would not\n\np. 40\n\nbe easy to find in any literature many passages to surpass it in this respect.\n\nIn other hymns we learn that the affairs of men are under his control; he is\nasked to prolong life, to punish transgressors; and a hope is held out that\nthe righteous shall see him reigning in the spirit world in conjunction with\nYama, the ruler of that region. Varuna in fact has attributes and functions\nascribed to him in the Vedas, of a higher moral character than any other of\nthe gods, and therefore men call upon him for pardon and purity. "Release us,"\nthey say, "from the sins of our fathers, and from those which we have\ncommitted in our own persons." And again, "Be gracious, O mighty god, be\ngracious. I have sinned through want of power; be gracious."\n\nIn the hymns addressed to Mitra and Varuna together, almost the same terms are\nemployed as when Varuna is addressed alone. Both are spoken of as righteous,\nand as the promoters of religion. They are said to avenge sin and falsehood.\n\nIn the Vedic literature, though Varuna is not regarded chiefly as the god of\nthe ocean, as he is in the later writings, but rather, as the above hymns\nshow, as one of the gods of light, yet there are passages which describe him\nas being connected with the waters of the atmosphere and on the earth, which\nafford some foundation for the later conceptions of his kingdom. Thus, for\ninstance, we read, "May the waters which are celestial, and those which flow;\nthose for which channels are dug, and those which are self-produced; those\nwhich are proceeding to the ocean, and are bright and purifying, preserve me!\nMay those (waters) in the midst of which King Varuna goes . . . preserve me!"\n* In other places\n\np. 41\n\nhe is said to dwell in the waters as Soma does in the woods. Professor Roth\ngives a probable explanation as to the manner in which Varuna, who was\noriginally the god of the heavens, came to be regarded as the god of the\nocean. He says: * "When, on the one hand, the conception of Varuna as the all-\nembracing heaven had been established, and, on the other hand, the observation\nof the rivers flowing towards the ends of the earth and to the sea had led to\nthe conjecture that there existed an ocean enclosing the earth in its bosom,\nthen the way was thoroughly prepared for connecting Varuna with the ocean."\n\nIn the Br\xc4\x81hmana of the Rig-Veda \xe2\x80\xa0 is an interesting legend showing that\nprobably human sacrifices were at one time offered to Varuna. A certain king\nnamed Harischandra had no son. Being greatly distressed on this account, as a\nson was necessary to the due performance of his funeral ceremonies, the king,\nacting upon the advice of N\xc4\x81rada the sage, went to Varuna, saying--\n\n"Let but a son be born, O king! to me,  \n And I will sacrifice that son to thee."\n\n[paragraph continues] Varuna heard the prayer, and granted a son. When the boy\ngrew up, his father told him of the vow he had made; but unfortunately the son\nwas not willing to be sacrificed, and left his home. Varuna, not being at all\npleased at the non-fulfilment of the king\'s vow, afflicted him with dropsy.\nFor six years the boy wandered in the forest; at length, happening to meet\nwith a poor Br\xc4\x81hman with his three sons, the prince proposed to purchase one\nof them to offer to the god as a substitute for himself. The father could not\ngive up his firstborn,\n\np. 42\n\nthe mother would not yield her youngest; the middle one was therefore taken.\nThe prince then returned home, taking with him the Br\xc4\x81hman\'s son. At first the\nking was delighted at the prospect of being able to keep his promise to the\ndeity; but a difficulty now arose as to who would slay the boy. After some\ntime, on the consideration of a large present being made to him, the boy\'s\nfather consented to do this The boy was bound, the father ready to strike,\nwhen the boy asked permission to recite some texts in praise of the gods. Of\ncourse this was granted; and as a result the deities thus lauded were so\npleased with the boy\'s piety, that they interceded with Varuna to spare him.\nVaruna granted their request, suffered the boy to live, and Harischandra\nrecovered from his sickness.\n\nIn the Pur\xc4\x81nas, as mentioned before, Varuna is described as the god of the\nocean. After a great conflict between the powers of heaven and earth, when\norder was again restored, the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" records the position assigned to\nthe various deities. In that account Varuna is said to rule over the waters.\nIn the same Pur\xc4\x81na we read that an old Br\xc4\x81hman named Richika was most anxious\nto obtain in marriage a daughter of King G\xc4\x81dhi, who was really an incarnation\nof Indra. G\xc4\x81dhi refused to give his daughter to Richika except on one\ncondition: that he would present him with a thousand fleet horses, each having\none white ear. Horses of this colour were special favourites of Indra; hence\nthose sacrificed to him usually had this peculiarity. The Br\xc4\x81hman is said to\nhave propitiated Varuna, the god of the ocean, who gave him the thousand\nsteeds, by means of which he was able to obtain the princess in marriage.\n\nVaruna is represented in pictures as a white man\n\np. 43\n\nsitting upon a fabulous marine monster called a _makara_. This animal has the\nhead and front legs of an antelope, and the body and tail of a fish. In his\nright hand he carries a noose. He is occasionally worshipped in seasons of\ndrought, and by fishermen as they cast their nets, but nowadays no images of\nhim are made.\n\nThe following legend is found in the "Padma Pur\xc4\x81na." * On one occasion R\xc4\x81vana,\nthe demon king of the island, was travelling home to Ceylon, carrying with him\na stone linga, the emblem of Siva. He was desirous of setting up the worship\nof the great god there, and was taking the image from the Himalayas for this\npurpose. But the gods, fearing he would grow too powerful through his devotion\nto Siva, wished to frustrate his purpose. Siva, in giving the stone, made\nR\xc4\x81vana promise that wherever it first touched the ground, after leaving Siva\'s\nabode, it should remain. Aware of this fact, the gods tried to induce him to\nlet it rest on the earth before he reached Ceylon. At last it was agreed that\nVaruna should enter R\xc4\x81vana\'s body, so that, in attempting to free himself, he\nmight be compelled to loose his hold of the _linga_. Accordingly Varuna\nentered R\xc4\x81vana, and caused him such intense pain that he could scarcely bear\nit. When thus suffering, Indra, in the form of an old Br\xc4\x81hman, passed by, and\noffered to take hold of the stone. No sooner did R\xc4\x81vana entrust it to hire,\nthan he let it fall to the ground. It is said that it sank into the earth, the\ntop of it being visible at Vaidyan\xc4\x81th in Birbhum to this day. The river Khursu\nis said to have taken its rise from Varuna when he left R\xc4\x81vana at this place;\nand, as a result, the Hindus will not drink of its waters.\n\nAlthough Varuna is described in the Vedas as a\n\np. 44\n\nholy being, according to the teaching of the Pur\xc4\x81nas his heaven is a place of\nsensual delights. He sits with his queen Varun\xc4\xab on a throne of diamonds;\nSamudr\xc4\x81 (the sea), Gang\xc4\x81 (the Ganges), and the gods and goddesses of different\nrivers, lakes, springs, etc., form his court. And stories are told of conduct\nthe very opposite to what would be expected in one who once was addressed in\nsuch language as is found in the Vedic hymns. He is said, conjointly with\nSurya, to have been enamoured of Urvasi, a nymph of Indra\'s heaven, by whom\nthey had a son named Agastya, one of the most eminent of Hindu ascetics.\n\nVaruna is also known as Prachetas, the wise; Jalapati, the lord of water;\nY\xc4\x81dapati, the lord of aquatic animals; Ambur\xc4\x81ja, the king of waters; Pas\xc4\xab, the\nnoose-carrier.\n\n##### 4\\. THE ASVINS.\n\nFrom the hymns addressed to these deities it is not at all easy to know who or\nwhat they are. Y\xc4\x81ska, the commentator of the Vedas, deriving the name from a\nroot meaning "to fill," says they are called Asvins because they pervade\neverything, the one with light, the other with moisture. Another commentator\nsays they are called Asvins because they ride upon horses. Some say that by\nthem heaven and earth are indicated; others that they are day and night;\nothers, again, that they are the sun and moon. Professor Roth says, "They hold\na perfectly distinct position in the entire body of the Vedic deities of\nlight. They are the earliest bringers of light in the morning sky, who hasten\non in the clouds before the Dawn and prepare the way for her." * In some hymns\nthey are said to be sons of the sun ( _vide_  \n\np. 45\n\n[paragraph continues] Surya); in others are called children of the sky; in\nothers, again, as the offspring of the ocean. They seem to represent the\ntransition from night to morning--night when it is passing into day.\n\nThe Asvins are said to have had Sury\xc4\x81, the daughter of Savitri, as their\ncommon wife. She chose them, as her life was lonely. Her father had intended\nher to marry Soma; but, as the gods were anxious to obtain so beautiful a\nbride, it was agreed that they should run a race, Surya being the prize of the\nwinner. The Asvins were successful, and she ascended their chariot. * In\nanother passage Soma is said to have been her husband; the Asvins being\nfriends of the bridegroom.\n\nThe Asvins are regarded as the physicians of the gods, and are declared to be\nable to restore to health the blind, the sick, the lame, and the emaciated\namongst mortals. They are the special guardians of the slow and backward; the\ndevoted friends of elderly women who are unmarried. They are said to preside\nover love and marriage, and are implored to bring together hearts that love. \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nA number of legends are found illustrating the power of the Asvins in healing\nthe sick and assisting those in trouble, from which we learn that they could\nrestore youth and vigour to the aged and decrepit; they rescued a man from\ndrowning, and carried him in safety to his home. The leg of Vispal\xc4\x81, that was\ncut off in battle, they replaced by an iron one. At the request of a wolf,\nthey restored sight to a man who had been blinded by his father as a\npunishment for slaughtering a hundred and one sheep, which he gave to the wolf\nto eat. They restored sight and power to walk to one who was blind and lame.\nAs a result of these and other similar legends,\n\np. 46\n\nthe Asvins are invoked for "offspring, wealth, victory, destruction of\nenemies, the preservation of the worshippers themselves, of their houses and\ncattle."\n\nThe following legend of the cure they effected on Chyavana, from the\n"Satapatha Br\xc4\x81hmana," * will illustrate the peculiar features of the work of\nthe Asvins:--Chyavana, having assumed a shrivelled form, was abandoned by his\nfamily. Sary\xc4\x81ta, a Rishi, with his tribe settled in the neighbourhood; when\nhis sons seeing the body of Chyavana, not knowing it was a human being, pelted\nit with stones. Chyavana naturally resented this, and sowed dissension amongst\nthe family of Sary\xc4\x81ta. Anxious to learn the cause of this, Sary\xc4\x81ta inquired of\nthe shepherds near if they could account for it; they told him that his sons\nhad insulted Chyavana. Sary\xc4\x81ta thereupon took his daughter Sukany\xc4\x81 in his\nchariot, and, apologizing for what had been done, gave his daughter to the\ndecrepit man as a peace-offering.\n\nNow the Asvins were in the habit of wandering about the world performing\ncures, and, seeing Sukany\xc4\x81, they were delighted with her beauty and wished to\nseduce her. They said, "What is that shrivelled body by which you are lying?\nLeave him and follow us." She replied that whilst he lived she would not leave\nthe man to whom her father had given her. When they came to her a second time,\nacting on her husband\'s suggestion she said, "You speak contemptuously of my\nhusband, whilst you are incomplete and imperfect yourselves." And on condition\nthat they would make her husband young again, she consented to tell them in\nwhat respect they were imperfect and incomplete. Upon this they told her to\ntake her husband to a certain pond.\n\np. 47\n\n[paragraph continues] After bathing there, he came forth with his youth\nrenewed. Sukany\xc4\x81 told the Asvins that they were imperfect because they had not\nbeen invited to join the other gods in a great sacrifice that was to be\ncelebrated at Kurukshetra. The Asvins proceeded to the place of sacrifice,\nand, asking to be allowed to join in it, were told that they could not do so,\nbecause they had wandered familiarly among men, performing cures. In reply to\nthis, the Asvins declared that the gods were making a headless sacrifice. The\ngods inquiring how this could be, the Asvins replied, "Invite us to join you,\nand we will tell you." To this the gods consented.\n\nIn another account of this legend, it is said that, as the Asvins were\nphysicians, they were consequently unclean; hence no Br\xc4\x81hman must be a\nphysician, or he is thereby unfitted for the work of a priest; but as the work\nof the Asvins was necessary, they were purified, and then allowed to join the\ngods. They then restored the head of the sacrifice.\n\nProfessor Goldstucker * says, "The myth of the Asvins is one of that class of\nmyths in which two distinct elements, the cosmical and the human or\nhistorical, have gradually become blended into one. . . . The historical or\nhuman element in it, I believe, is represented by those legends which refer to\nthe wonderful cures effected by the Asvins, and to their performances of a\nkindred sort; the cosmical element is that relating to their luminous nature.\nThe link which connects both seems to be the mysteriousness of the nature and\neffects of light and of the healing art at a remote antiquity. It would appear\nthat these Asvins, like the Ribhus, were originally renowned mortals, who, in\nthe course of time, were translated into the companionship of the gods."\n\np. 48\n\n##### 5\\. USHAS.\n\nThis goddess, representative of the Dawn, is a favourite object of celebration\nwith the Vedic poets, and "the hymns addressed to her are among the most\nbeautiful--if not the most beautiful--in the entire collection." * She is\ndescribed as the daughter of the Sky, has Night for her sister, and is related\nto Varuna. She is at times spoken of as the wife of the Sun; at other times\nAgni is given as her lover; the Asvins are her friends. Indra is at one time\nregarded as her creator; at another time he assumes a hostile position, and\neven crushed her chariot with his thunderbolt.\n\nUshas is said \xe2\x80\xa0 to travel in a shining chariot drawn by ruddy horses or cows.\nLike a beautiful maiden dressed by her mother, a dancing girl covered with\njewels, a gaily-attired wife appearing before her husband, or a beautiful girl\ncorning from her bath, she, smiling and confiding in the irresistible power of\nher attractions, unfolds her bosom to the gaze of the beholders. She dispels\nthe darkness, disclosing the treasures it concealed. She illuminates the\nworld, revealing its most distant extremities. She is the life and health of\nall things, causing the birds to fly from their nests, and, like a young\nhousewife, awaking all her creatures, sends them forth to the pursuit of their\nvaried occupations. She does good service to the gods, by causing the\nworshippers to awake, and the sacrificial fires to be lighted. She is asked to\narouse only the devout and liberal, while she allows the niggardly to sleep\non. She is young, being born every day; and yet she is old, being immortal,\nwearing out the lives of successive generations, which\n\np. 49\n\ndisappear one after another, whilst she continues undying. The souls of the\ndeparted are said to go to her and to the sun.\n\nIn the following lines * will be found the main teaching of the Vedas\nrespecting this goddess:--\n\n"Hail, ruddy Ushas, golden goddess, borne  \n Upon thy shining car, thou comest like  \n A lovely maiden by her mother decked,  \n Disclosing coyly all thy hidden grace  \n To our admiring eyes; or like a wife  \n Unveiling to her lord, with conscious pride,  \n Beauties which, as he gazes lovingly,  \n Seem fresher, fairer, each succeeding morn.  \n Through years and years thou hast lived on, and yet  \n Thou\'rt ever young. Thou art the breath and life  \n Of all that breathes and lives, awaking day by day  \n Myriads of prostrate sleepers, as from death,  \n Causing the birds to flutter in their nests,  \n And rousing men to ply with busy feet  \n Their daily duties and appointed tasks,  \n Toiling for wealth, or pleasure, or renown."\n\nIn the following verses by Dr. Muir \xe2\x80\xa0 we have a still more vivid picture of\nthis goddess as represented in the Vedic hymns:--\n\n"Hail, Ushas, daughter of the sky,  \n   Who, borne upon thy shining car  \n   By ruddy steeds from realms afar,  \n And ever lightening drawest nigh--\n\n"Thou sweetly smilest, goddess fair,  \n   Disclosing all thy youthful grace,  \n   Thy bosom bright, thy radiant face,  \n And lustre of thy golden hair--\n\n"She shines a fond and winning bride,  \n   Who robes her form in brilliant guise,  \n   And to her lord\'s admiring eyes  \n Displays her charms with conscious pride--\n\np. 50\n\n"Or virgin by her mother decked,  \n   Who, glorying in her beauty, shows  \n   In every glance her power she knows  \n All eyes to fix, all hearts subject--\n\n"Or actress, who by skill in song  \n   And dance, and graceful gestures light,  \n   And many-coloured vestures bright,  \n Enchants the eager, gazing throng--\n\n"Or maid, who, wont her limbs to lave  \n   In some cold stream among the woods,  \n   Where never vulgar eye intrudes,  \n Emerges fairer from the wave--\n\n"But closely by the amorous Sun  \n   Pursued and vanquished in the race,  \n   Thou soon art locked in his embrace,  \n And with him blendest into one.\n\n"Fair Ushas, though through years untold  \n   Thou hast lived on, yet thou art born  \n   Anew on each succeeding morn,  \n And so thou art both young and old.\n\n"As in thy fated ceaseless course  \n   Thou risest on us day by day,  \n   Thou wearest all our lives away  \n With silent, ever-wasting force.\n\n"Their round our generations run:  \n   The old depart, and in their place  \n   Springs ever up a younger race,  \n Whilst thou, immortal, lookest on.\n\n"All those who watched for thee of old  \n   Are gone, and now \'tis we who gaze  \n   On thy approach; in future days  \n Shall other men thy beams behold.\n\n"But \'tis not thoughts so grave and sad  \n   Alone that thou dost with thee bring,  \n   A shadow o\'er our hearts to fling  \n Thy beams returning make us glad.\n\np. 51\n\n"Thy sister, sad and sombre Night,  \n   With stars that in the blue expanse,  \n   Like sleepless eyes, mysterious glance,  \n At thy approach is quenched in light;\n\n"And earthly forms, till now concealed  \n   Behind her veil of dusky hue,  \n   Once more come sharply out to view,  \n By thine illuming glow revealed.\n\n"Thou art the life of all that lives,  \n   The breath of all that breathes; the sight  \n   Of thee makes every countenance bright,  \n New strength to every spirit gives.\n\n"When thou dost pierce the murky gloom,  \n   Birds flutter forth front every brake,  \n   All sleepers as from death awake,  \n And men their myriad tasks resume.\n\n"Some, prosperous, wake in listless mood,  \n   And others every nerve to strain  \n   The goal of power or wealth to gain,  \n Or what they deem the highest good.\n\n"But some to holier thoughts aspire,  \n   In hymns the race celestial praise,  \n   And light, on human Hearths to blaze,  \n The heaven-born sacrificial fire.\n\n"And not alone do bard and priest  \n   Awake--the gods thy power confess  \n   By starting into consciousness  \n When thy first rays suffuse the east;\n\n"And hasting downward from the sky,  \n   They visit men devout and good,  \n   Consume their consecrated food,  \n And all their longings satisfy.\n\n"Bright goddess, let thy genial rays  \n   To us bring store of envied wealth  \n   In kine and steeds, and sons, with health,  \n And joy of heart, and length of days."\n\np. 52\n\nIn the later writings we find merely the name of Ushas. The people lost much\nof their poetic fire; hence the more human and practical deities caused the\nmore poetical ones to pass into oblivion. Some of the figures in the preceding\nextracts are most beautifully drawn. The changing colours of the dawn are\ncompared to the many-coloured robes of the dancing girl; the golden tipped\nclouds that appear ere the sun shines in his strength, are like the jewels of\na bride decked for her husband; whilst the quiet modesty of the dawn herself\nis like a shy maiden, conscious indeed of her beauty, entering society under\nthe protection of her mother. And from the last four lines of the metrical\nsketch it will be noticed that she was believed to be able to bestow upon her\nworshippers cattle, horses, sons, health, joy, and length of days.\n\n![](img/05200.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[30:*](hmvp10.htm#fr_25) "Indian Wisdom," p. 20.\n\n[31:*](hmvp10.htm#fr_26) Kennedy\'s "Hindu Mythology," p. 345.\n\n[32:*](hmvp10.htm#fr_27) "Indian Wisdom," p. 19.\n\n[33:*](hmvp10.htm#fr_28) Muir, O.
