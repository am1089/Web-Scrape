Vyasa said :-- O King! Please hear attentively about the extraordinary\nboon that was given by Mahadeva, the God of gods, to the great warrior,\nRaktabija. Whenever a drop of blood from the body of that great warrior will\ndrop on the surface of the earth, immediately will arise innumerable Danavas,\nequal in form and power to him; thus the Deva Rudra granted the Demon the\nwonderful boon. Thus elated with the boon, he entered into the battlefield\nwith great force in order to kill Kalika with Ambika Devi. Seeing the Vai _sn_\navi S\xc2\x92akti, lotus-eyed, seated on the bird Garu _d_ a, the Demon struck Her\nwith a violent weapon (named S\xc2\x92akti). She then baffled the weapon by Her club\nand hurled Sudars\xc2\x92ana disc on the great Asura Raktabija. Thus struck by the\ndisc, blood began to ooze out from his body as the red stream of soft red\nsandstone comes out of a mountain-top. Wherever on the surface of the earth\ndrops of blood fell from his body, then and there sprang out thousands and\nthousands of demons like him. Indra _n_ i, the wife of Indra, became very\nangry and struck the terrible Raktabija with his thunderbolt. Streams of blood\nthen began to ooze out from his body. No sooner the drops of blood fell from\nthe Demon\xc2\x92s body, than were instantaneously born from the blood many powerful\nAsuras, of similar forms, having similar weapons and hard to be conquered in\nbattle. Brahma _n_ i then becoming enraged\n\n\n\np. 455\n\n\n\nstruck at him with the staff of Brahma with greater force. Mahes\xc2\x92vari rent the\nDanava asunder by striking him with Her trident. Nara Simhi pierced the Asura\nwith Her nails; Varahi struck at him with Her teeth. Then the Danava becoming\nangry shot at them all with sharpened arrows and pierced them all. Thus when\nthe Matrika Devis were pierced by the club and other various weapons of that\ngreat Asura, they got very angry and pierced the Danavas in return with shots\nof arrows. Kaumari, too, struck at his breast with Her weapon, named S\xc2\x92akti.\nThe Danavas then got angry and hurled on them multitude of arrows and began to\npierce them. O King! The Cha _nd_ ika Devi, getting angry, cut off his weapons\ninto pieces and shot violently at him other arrows. O King! Thus struck by\nsevere blows, when blood began to flow in profuse quantities from his body,\nthousands and thousands of Danavas resembling Raktabija sprang out instantly\nfrom it. So much so, that the heavens were all covered over with Raktabijas\nthat sprang up from the blood. They all covered all over their bodies with\ncoats of armour, began to fight terribly with weapons in their hands. Then the\nDevas, seeing that the innumerable Raktavijas were striking the Devi, became\nvery much frightened and were distressed with sorrow. They began to talk with\neach other with sorrowful countenances that thousands and thousands of huge\nbodied warriors were springing from the blood. These were all very powerful;\nso how could they be destroyed! In this battlefield there were now left only\nthe Matrikas, Kalika, and Cha _nd_ ika. It would be certainly extremely\ndifficult for them to conquer all these Danavas. And if at that moment,\nS\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha were to join them with his army, certainly a great\ncatastrophe would occur.\n\n\n\n22-28. Vyasa said :-- O King! When the Devas were thus extremely anxious, out\nof terror, Ambika Devi said to the lotus-eyed Kali :-- \xc2\x93O Chamu _nd_ a! Open\nout your mouth quickly, and no sooner I strike Raktabija with weapons, you\nwould drink off the blood as fast as it runs out of his body. Instantly I will\nkill those Danavas sprung from the blood with sharpened arrows, clubs, swords\nand Mu _s_ alas; and you would then be able to devour them all at your will,\nand, then, roam in this field as you like. O Large-eyed One! You would drink\noff all the jets of blood in such a way that not a drop of it escapes and\nfalls on the ground. And then when they will all be devoured, no more Danavas\nwould be able to spring. Thus they will surely be extirpated; otherwise they\nwill never be destroyed. Let me begin to strike blows after blows on Raktabija\nand you better drink off quickly all the blood, being intent on destroying the\nforces. O Chamu _nd_ e! Thus, the Danavas being all exterminated, we will hand\nover to the Indra, the lord of the Devas, his Heavens without\n\n\n\np. 456\n\n\n\nany enemy; and, thus, we can go peacefully and happily to our own places.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n29-47. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Chamu _nd_ a Devi, of furious strength,\nhearing thus the Devi\xc2\x92s words began to drink the jets of blood coming out of\nthe body of Raktabija. The Devi Ambika began to cut the Demon\xc2\x92s body into\npieces and Chamu _nd_ a, of thin belly, went on devouring them. Then\nRaktabija, becoming angry, struck Chamu _nd_ a with his club. But though She\nwas thus hurt severely, She drank off the blood and then devoured all the\nlimbs thereof. O King! Thus Kalika Devi drank off the blood of all other\npowerful wicked Danava Raktabijas that sprang out of the blood. Ambika thus\ndestroyed them. Thus, all the Danavas, created out of the blood were devoured;\nthen, there was left, lastly, the real Raktabija. Ambika Devi then cut him\nasunder into pieces by Her axe and thus killed him. Thus, when the dreadful\nRaktabija was slain in the battle, the Danavas fled away trembling with fear.\nWithout any weapons, covered all over their bodies with blood, and void of\nconsciousness they uttered, dumb confounded \xc2\x93Alas! Alas! What has happened,\nwhat has happened.\xc2\x94 Thus crying, they told their King S\xc2\x92umbha thus :-- \xc2\x93O King\nof Kings! Ambika Devi has killed Raktabija and Chamu _nd_ a has drunk off all\ntheir blood. The carrier (Vahana) of Devi, the powerful ferocious Lion killed\nother powerful warriors and Kali devoured the remaining soldiers. O Lord of\nthe Danavas! We have fled and come to you to give the news of the battle and\nto describe the wonderful doings of that Cha _nd_ ika Devi in the battlefield.\nO King! In our opinion, no one will be able to conquer that Lady, be he a\nDaitya, Danava, Gandarbha, Asura, Yak _s_ a, Pannaga, Chara _n_ a, Rak _s_\nasa, or an Uraga. O King of Kings! The other Goddesses, Indra _n_ i and\nothers, have come to the battle, on their own carriers respectively and are\nfighting with various weapons. O Lord of the Danavas! The Danava forces are\nall slain by them with the excellent weapons in their hands. Even Raktabija\nhas been slain in no time. That Lion, of indomitable prowess, killed the Rak\n_s_ asas in the battle; The Devi alone is hard to conquer; how much more would\nit be impossible to conquer Her, when She has been joined with other\ngoddesses. So consult with the ministers and do what is reasonable. In our\nopinion it is better to make treaty with Her and quit your enmity. O King!\nThink over the fact that that Lady destroyed all the Danavas and at last drank\noff the blood of Raktabija and at last killed him. What on earth can be more\nwonderful than this? O King! The Devi Ambika killed all the other Daityas and\nChamu _nd_ a devoured their blood, flesh, and all. Considering all this, it is\nnow better for us to serve the Devi Ambika or fly away to Patala. No more\nfighting is desirable. She is\n\n\n\np. 457\n\n\n\nnot an ordinary woman; She is Maha Maya, there is not the least doubt in this.\nOnly to serve the cause of the Gods, She has manifested Herself and is now\ndestroying the Rak _s_ asas\xc2\x92 race.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n48\\. Vyasa said :-- Hearing thus, S\xc2\x92umbha got confounded by Kala (Death), as\nhis end was coming nigh, and said the following words, his lips quivering with\nanger.\n\n\n\n49-54. You are struck with fear; so you all take the refuge of Cha _nd_ ika or\nfly down to Patala; but I will kill Her with all my exertion and effort. I\nconquered all the hosts of Devas and I have enjoyed their kingdom; shall I\nnow, out of the fear of one Lady, fly and enter into the Patala. All my\nattendants, Raktabija and other heroes, are now slain in the battle and is it\npossible that I will now fly away out of the sake of preserving my life only.\nSee! The death of all the beings is ordained by Kala and it is unavoidable. No\nsooner a being is born, he is liable to the fear of death. How can a man,\nthen, out of fear of death, quit all his name and fame? O Nis\xc2\x92umbha! I will\nnow go immediately to the battle, mounting on my chariot and will return after\nslaying Her in battle. And if I cannot kill Her, I will not then return any\nmore. O Best of warriors! Better stand on my side with all your forces and\nkill that Lady in no time, with sharp arrows.\n\n\n\n55-58. Nis\xc2\x92umbha said :-- Today I will go to the battle and slaying that\nKalika, will shortly return here with Ambika. O King! Do not think at all for\nthat Lady; see my world-conquering strength and look at that weak woman; there\nis a vast difference. Cast aside your this great mental anxiety and trouble.\nEnjoy, O Brother, excellent things. I will bring that dignified Lady with all\nhonours before you. O King! You ought not to go to the battle when I am alive.\nI will presently go to the fight and bring for you that Lady as a sign of our\nvictory.\n\n\n\n59-60. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus saying, the younger brother, proud of his\nown strength, went hurriedly to the battlefield, mounting on his big chariot.\nHe was protected all over his body by his coat of armour and he was well\nprovided with various weapons and all other accoutrements of war. The bards\nbegan to sing hymns to him and various other propitious ceremonies were being\nperformed.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-ninth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the killing of\nRaktabija in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000 verses\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 30](bk05ch30.htm)\n\n'
