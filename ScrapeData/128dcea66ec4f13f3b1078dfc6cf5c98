I take thee, draught acceptable  \nto Indra. This is thy home. Thee, welcomest to Indra.  \nThee Set in waters, butter, realm of ether. Taken upon  \n......Indra.  \nThee seated in the sky, earth, air's mid-region, among the  \nGods and in the vault of heaven. Taken, etc. as above:  \n3 The strength-arousing essence of the waters, gathered in  \nthe Sun, Essence of waters\xc2\x92 essence, that, most excellent,  \nI take for you.  \nTaken, etc., as above.  \n4 Cups of strength-giving sacrifice, inspirers of the sage's  \nhymn  \nOf you, the handleless, have I collected all the sap and  \nstrength.  \nTaken, etc., as above.  \nUnited are ye twain: with bliss unite me. Parted are ye:  \nkeep me apart from evil.\n\np. 72\n\n5 Thou art the thunderbolt of Indra, winner of wealth: with  \nthee may this man win him riches.  \nIn gain of wealth we celebrate with praises her, Aditi by  \nname, the Mighty Mother,  \nOn whom this Universe of life hath settled. Thereon God  \nSavitar promote our dwelling!  \n6 Amrit is in the Waters, in the Waters healing medicine.  \nYea, Horses! at our praises of the Waters grow ye fleet  \nand strong.  \nWhatever wave, O ye celestial Waters, wealth-giving,  \ntowering high, and swiftly rushing, is yours, therewith  \nmay this man win him riches.  \n7 It was the wind, or it was thought, or the Gandharvas  \ntwenty-seven  \nThese at the first harnessed the horse: they set the power  \nof speed in him.  \n8 Steed, being yoked grow wind-swift: be beauteous as Indra's  \nright-hand steed.  \nOmniscient Maruts harness thee! Tvashtar put swiftness in  \nthy feet!  \n9 What speed, O Horse, was laid in thee in secret, what  \npassed in wind, bestowed upon the falcon,  \nWith that same strength be strong for us, O Courser,  \nwealth-winning and victorious in battle.  \nStarting to run your course, winners of riches, smell ye  \nBrihaspati's portion, O ye Horses.  \n10 By impulse of God Savitar, true Impeller, may ascend  \nBrihaspati's highest heaven.\n\np. 73\n\nBy impulse of God Savitar, true Impeller, may I ascend  \nthe highest heaven of Indra.  \nBy impulse of God Savitar, true Impeller, Brihaspati's  \nhighest heaven have I ascended.  \nBy impulse of God Savitar, true Impeller, I have ascended  \nIndra's loftiest heaven.  \n11 Brihaspati, win the prize. Lift up your voices to Brihaspati.  \nMake ye Brihaspati win the prize.  \nDo thou, O Indra, win the prize. To Indra lift your voices  \nup. Make Indra winner of the prize.  \n12 True hath been this your league whereby ye made  \nBrihaspati win the prize.  \nBrihaspati have ye caused to win the prize. Be freed, ye  \nForest-lords.  \nFaithful was this your league whereby ye have made Indra  \nwin the prize.  \nYe have made Indra win the prize. Be ye set free, ye  \nForest-lords.  \n13 Through impulse of God Savitar, true Impeller, mine be  \nBrihaspati's prize who winneth prizes.  \nOn to the goal, ye Steeds, winners of prizes, blocking the  \nways and meting out the courses!  \n14 Bound by the neck and at the flanks and in the mouth,  \nthat vigorous Courser lends new swiftness to his sped.\n\np. 74\n\nDrawing himself together as his strength allows, Dadhikras  \nspeeds along the windings of the paths. All-hail!  \n15 His pinion, rapid runner, fans him on his way, as of a bird  \nthat hastens onward to its aim,  \nAnd, as it were a falcon's gliding through the air, strikes  \nDadhikravan's side as he speeds on with might. All-hail!  \n16 Bless us the Coursers when we call, while slowly they move,  \nstrong singers, to the Gods\xc2\x92 assembly.  \nCrushing the wolf, the serpent, and the demons, may they  \ncompletely banish all affliction. All-hail!  \n17 May all those vigorous Coursers listen to our cry, hearers  \nof invocation, speeders on their way;  \nWinners of thousands, fain to win where meed is won, who  \ngather of themselves great wealth in every race.  \n18 Deep-skilled in Law Eternal, wise, immortal, O Coursers,  \nhelp us in each fray for booty.  \nDrink of this meath, be satisfied, be joyful: then go on  \npaths which Gods are wont to travel.  \n19 To me come plenteous growth of wealth! Approach me  \nthese, Heaven and Earth, who wear each form and figure!  \nHither may Father come to me, and Mother. Soma with  \nimmortality approach me!  \n20 To the Friend, Hail! To the Good Fiend, Hail! To the  \nLater-born, Hail! To Resolution, Hail! To the Vasu, Hail!  \nTo the Lord of Days, Hail! To the Failing Day, Hail!  \nTo the Failing sprung from the Transitory, Hail! To the  \nTransitory sprung from the Final, Hal! To the Final  \nMundane, Hail! To the Lord of the World, Hail! To the  \nSovran Lord, Hail!\n\np. 75\n\n21 May life succeed through sacrifice. May life-breath thrive  \nby sacrifice. May the eye thrive by sacrifice. May the  \near thrive by sacrifice. May the back thrive by sacrifice.  \nMay sacrifice thrive by sacrifice.  \nWe have become the children of Prajapati. Gods, we have  \ngone to heaven.
