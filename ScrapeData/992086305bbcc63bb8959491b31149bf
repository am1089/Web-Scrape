Charm against pigeons regarded as ominous birds.\n\n1\\. O ye gods, if the pigeon, despatched as the messenger of Nirriti (the\ngoddess of destruction), hath come here seeking (us out), we shall sing his\npraises, and prepare (our) ransom. May our two-footed and four-footed\ncreatures be prosperous!  \n2\\. Auspicious to us shall be the pigeon that has been despatched; harmless,\nye gods, the bird shall be to our house! The sage Agni shall verily take\npleasure in our oblation; the winged missile shall avoid us!  \n3\\. The winged missile shall not do us injury: upon our hearth, our fireplace\nhe (the pigeon) takes his steps! Propitious he shall be to our cattle and  \nour domestics; may not, ye gods, the pigeon here do harm to us!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 29. Charm against ominous pigeons and owls](av195.htm)\n\n'
