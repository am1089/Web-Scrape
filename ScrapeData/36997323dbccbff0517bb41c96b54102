race,  \nVirtue's dear son, had cleft the mace,  \nThus with superior smile the best  \nOf chiefs the furious fiend addressed:  \n\n'Thou, worst of giant blood, at length  \nHast shown the utmost of thy strength,  \nAnd forced by greater might to bow,  \nThy vaunting threats are idle now.  \nMy shafts have cut thy club in twain:  \nUseless it lies upon the plain,  \nAnd all thy pride and haughty trust  \nLie with it levelled in the dust.  \nThe words that thou hast said to-day,  \nThat thou wouldst wipe the tears away  \nOf all the giants I have slain,  \nMy deeds shall render void and vain.  \nThou meanest of the giants' breed,  \nEvil in thought and word and deed.  \nMy hand shall take that life of thine  \nAs Garud 1 seized the juice divine.  \n\np. 264  \n\nThou, rent by shafts, this day shalt die:  \nLow on the ground thy corse shall lie,  \nAnd bubbles from the cloven neck  \nWith froth and blood thy skin shall deck,  \nWith dust and mire all rudely dyed,  \nThy torn arms lying by thy side,  \nWhile streams of blood each limb shall steep,  \nThou on earth's breast shalt take thy sleep  \nLike a fond lover when he strains  \nThe beauty whom at length he gains.  \nNow when thy heavy eyelids close  \nFor ever in thy deep repose,  \nAgain shall Dandak forest be  \nSafe refuge for the devotee.  \nThou slain, and all thy race who held  \nThe realm of Janasthan expelled,  \nAgain shall happy hermits rove,  \nFearing no danger, through the grove.  \nWithin those bounds, their brethren slain,  \nNo giant shall this day remain,  \nBut all shall fly with many a tear  \nAnd fearing, rid the saints of fear,  \nThis bitter day shall misery bring  \nOn all the race that calls thee king.  \nFierce as their lord, thy dames shall know,  \nBereft of joys, the taste of woe.  \nBase, cruel wretch, of evil mind,  \nPlaguer of Brahmans and mankind,  \nWith trembling hands each devotee  \nFeeds holy tires in dread of thee.'  \n\nThus with wild fury unrepressed  \nRaghu's brave son the fiend addressed;  \nAnd Khara, as his wrath grew high,  \nThus thundered forth his fierce reply:  \n\n'By senseless pride to madness wrought,  \nBy danger girt thou fearest naught,  \nNor heedest, numbered with the dead,  \nWhat thou shouldst say and leave unsaid.  \nWhen Fate's tremendous coils enfold  \nThe captive in resistless hold,  \nHe knows not right from wrong, each sense  \nNumbed by that deadly influence.'  \n\nHe spoke, and when his speech was done  \nBent his fierce brows on Raghu's son.  \nWith eager eyes he looked around  \nIf lethal arms might yet be found.  \nNot far away and full in view  \nA Sal-tree towering upward grew.  \nHis lips in mighty strain compressed,  \nHe tore it up with root and crest,  \nWith huge arms waved it o'er his head  \nAnd hurled it shouting, Thou art dead.  \nBut Rama, unsurpassed in might.  \nStayed with his shafts its onward flight,  \nAnd furious longing seized his soul  \nThe giant in the dust to roll.  \nGreat drops of sweat each limb bedewed,  \nHis red eyes showed his wrathful mood.  \nA thousand arrows, swiftly sent,  \nThe giant's bosom tore and rent  \nFrom every gash his body showed  \nThe blood in foamy torrents flowed,  \nAs springing from their caverns leap  \nSwift rivers down the mountain steep.  \nWhen Khara felt each deadened power  \nYielding beneath that murderous shower,  \nHe charged, infuriate with the scent  \nOf blood, in dire bewilderment.  \nBut Rama watched, with ready bow,  \nThe onset of his bleeding foe,  \nAnd ere the monster reached him, drew  \nBackward in haste a yard or two.  \nThen from his side a shaft be took  \nWhose mortal stroke no life might brook:  \nOf peerless might, it bore the name  \nOf Brahma's staff, and glowed with flame:  \nLord Indra, ruler of the skies,  \nHimself had given the glorious prize,  \nHis bow the virtuous hero drew,  \nAnd at the fiend the arrow flew.  \nHissing and roaring like the blast  \nOf tempest through the air it passed,  \nAnd fixed, by Rama's vigour sped,  \nIn the foe's breast its pointed head.  \nThen fell the fiend: the quenchless flame  \nBurnt furious in his wounded frame.  \nSo burnt by Rudra Andhak 1 fell  \nIn S'vetaranya's silvery dell:  \nSo Namuchi and Vritra 2 died  \nBy steaming bolts that tamed their pride:  \nSo Bala 3 fell by lightning sent  \nBy Him who rules the firmament.  \n\nThen all the Gods in close array  \nWith the bright hosts who sing and play,  \nFilled full of rapture and amaze,  \nSang hymns of joy in Rama's praise,  \nBeat their celestial drums and shed  \nRain of sweet flowers upon his head.  \nFor three short hours had scarcely flown,  \nAnd by his pointed shafts o'erthrown  \nThe twice seven thousand fiends, whose will  \nCould change their shapes, in death were still,  \nWith Tris'iras and Dushan slain,  \nAnd Khara, leader of the train.  \n'O wondrous deed,' the bards began,  \n'The noblest deed of virtuous man!  \nHeroic strength that stood alone,  \nAnd firmness e'en as Vishnu's own!'  \n\nThus having sung, the shining train  \nTurned to their heavenly homes again.  \n\np. 265  \n\nThen the high saints of royal race  \nAnd loftiest station sought the place,  \nAnd by the great Agastya led,  \nWith reverence to Rama said:  \n\n'For this, Lord Indra, glorious sire,  \nMajestic as the burning fire,  \nWho crushes cities in his rage,  \nSought S'arabhanga's hermitage.  \nThou wast, this great design to aid,  \nLed by the saints to seek this shade,  \nAnd with thy mighty arm to kill  \nThe giants who delight in ill.  \nThou Das'aratha's noble son,  \nThe battle for our sake hast won,  \nAnd saints in Dandak's wild who live  \nTheir days to holy tasks can give.'  \n\nForth from the mountain cavern came  \nThe hero Lakshman with the dame.  \nAnd rapture beaming from his face.  \nBesought the hermit dwelling-place.  \nThen when the mighty saints had paid  \nDue honour for the victor's aid,  \nThe glorious Rama honoured too  \nBy Lakshman to his cot withdrew.  \nWhen Sita looked upon her lord,  \nHis foemen slain, the saints restored,  \nIn pride and rapture uncontrolled  \nShe clasped him in her loving hold.  \nOn the dead fiends her glances fell:  \nShe saw her lord alive and well,  \nVictorious after toil and pain,  \nAnd Janak's child was blest again.  \nOnce more, once more with new delight  \nHer tender arms she threw  \nRound Rama whose victorious might  \nHad crushed the demon crew.  \nThen as his grateful reverence paid  \nEach saint of lofty soul,  \nO'er her sweet face, all fears allayed,  \nThe flush of transport stole.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[263:1](ry228.htm#fr_477) Garud the King of Birds, carried off the *Amrit* or\ndrink of Paradise from Indra's
