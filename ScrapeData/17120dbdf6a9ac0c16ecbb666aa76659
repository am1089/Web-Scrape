And I have\nentered the great forest 5.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a's wife said:\n\nWhere is that forest, O very intelligent person! what are the trees (there),\nand what the rivers, and the hills and mountains; and at what distance is that\nforest?\n\np. 285\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said:\n\nThere is nothing else more delightful than that, when there is no distinction\nfrom it. There is nothing more afflicting than that, when there is a\ndistinction from it 1. There is nothing smaller than that, there is nothing\nlarger than that 2. There is nothing more subtle than that; there is no other\nhappiness equal to, that. Entering it, the twice-born do not grieve, and do\nnot exult 3. They are not afraid of anybody, and nobody is afraid of them. In\nthat forest 4 are seven large trees 5, seven fruits, and seven guests; seven\nhermitages, seven (forms of) concentration, and seven (forms of) initiation.\nThis is the description of the forest. That forest is filled with trees\nproducing splendid flowers and fruits of five colours 6. That forest\n\np. 286\n\nis filled with trees producing flowers and fruits of four colours. That forest\nis filled with trees producing flowers and fruits of three colours, and mixed.\nThat forest is filled with trees producing flowers and fruits of two colours,\nand of beautiful colours. That forest is filled with trees producing flowers\nand fruits of one colour, and fragrant. That forest is filled with two large\ntrees producing numerous flowers and fruits of undistinguished colours 1.\nThere is one fire 2 here, connected with the Brahman 3, and having a good mind\n4. And there is fuel here, (namely) the five senses. The seven (forms of)\nemancipation from them are the seven (forms of) initiation 5. The qualities\nare the fruits, and the guests eat the fruits. There, in various places, the\ngreat sages receive hospitality. And when they have been worshipped and have\ndisappeared 6, another forest shines forth, in which intelligence is the tree,\nand emancipation the fruit, and which possesses shade (in the form of)\ntranquillity,\n\np. 287\n\nwhich depends on knowledge, which has contentment for its water, and which has\nthe Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a within for the sun. The good who attain to that, have no\nfear afterwards. Its end cannot be perceived upwards or downwards or\nhorizontally 1. There always dwell seven females there 2, with faces (turned)\ndownwards, full of brilliance, and causes of generation. They absorb 3 all the\nhigher delights of people, as inconstancy (absorbs) everything 4. In that same\n5 (principle) the seven perfect sages, together with their chiefs, the richest\n6, abide, and again emerge from the same. Glory; brilliance, and greatness,\nenlightenment, victory, perfection, and power 7\\--these seven rays follow\nafter this same sun. Hills and mountains also are there collected together,\nand rivers and streams flowing with water produced from the Brahman 8. And\nthere is the confluence of the rivers in the secluded place 9 for the\n\np. 288\n\nsacrifice, whence those who are contented in their own selfs repair to the\ndivine grandsire himself. Those whose wishes are reduced\n[1](sbe0840.htm#fn_1387), whose wishes are (fixed) on good vows, whose sins\nare burnt up by penance, merging the self in the self\n[2](sbe0840.htm#fn_1388), devote themselves to Brahman. Those people who\nunderstand the forest of knowledge [3](sbe0840.htm#fn_1389), praise\ntranquillity. And aspiring to that forest, they are born so as not to lose\ncourage [4](sbe0840.htm#fn_1390). Such, indeed, is this holy forest, as\nunderstood by Brahma _n_ as. And understanding it, they act (accordingly),\nbeing directed by the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[284:1](sbe0838.htm#fr_1366) Cf. Gita, [p. 61](sbe0806.htm#page_61). The water\nis that required for the sacrifice. The words 'the Brahman is his origin' are\nnot quite clear, as being not connected with the figure employed. Perhaps it\nmight be taken otherwise thus, 'the Brahman (is) the fire produced from the\nBrahman,' this last standing for the ara _n_ i.\n\n[284:2](sbe0838.htm#fr_1367) I. e. one who understands the truth, Nilaka _nth_\na; God, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. The same sentence winds up two of the following\nchapters; and at [p. 310](sbe0846.htm#page_310) K _ri_ sh _n_ a says the\nKshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a signifies the supreme self. See Gita, [p.\n102](sbe0814.htm#page_102) seq.\n\n[284:3](sbe0839.htm#fr_1368) Cf. Lalita Vistara, p. 44.\n\n[284:4](sbe0839.htm#fr_1369) I. e. not with the help of son, wealth, &c., says\nNilaka _nth_ a, as each man's salvation after having got into the course of\nworldly life depends on himself. Cf. _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap.\n193, st. 32, and Manu IV, 240; obstructor, thief, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[284:5](sbe0839.htm#fr_1370) I. e. the Brahman. Nilaka _nth_ a compares a text\nfrom the _S_ ruti, 'Kim svid vana _m_ ka u sa v _ri_ ksha asa;' see Rig-veda\nX, 31, 7.\n\n[285:1](sbe0839.htm#fr_1371) Cf. _Kh_ andogya, pp. 516, 517.\n\n[285:2](sbe0839.htm#fr_1372) Cf. Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p.\n180](sbe0825.htm#page_180) and note there.\n\n[285:3](sbe0839.htm#fr_1373) Cf. as to all this Gita, [p.\n101](sbe0814.htm#page_101).\n\n[285:4](sbe0839.htm#fr_1374) This is not the forest spoken of before. but what\nhas been before called the 'impassable place,' but which also at p. 286 is by\nimplication called a forest, viz. the course of worldly life.\n\n[285:5](sbe0839.htm#fr_1375) Viz. the eye, ear, tongue, skin, and nose, and\nthe mind, and understanding--these are called trees, as being producers of the\nfruits, namely, the pleasures and pains derived from their several operations;\nthe guests are the powers of each sense personified--they receive the fruits\nabove described; the hermitages are the trees above mentioned, in which the\nguests take shelter; the seven forms of concentration are the exclusion from\nthe self of the seven functions of the seven senses &c. already referred to;\nthe seven forms of initiation refer to the initiation into the higher life, by\nrepudiating as not one's own the actions of each member out of the group of\nseven. Cf. as to this _Kh_ andogya, p. 219, and commentary there.\n\n[285:6](sbe0839.htm#fr_1376) Cf. for these different numbers of colours, Yoga-\nsutra II, 19, and commentary, p. 105, and _S_ a _n_ khya-sara, p. 18. The\ntrees here meant are the Tanmatras, or subtle elements, and the theory is that\nthe Gandha-tanmatra, or subtle element of smell, has five qualities, its p.\n286 own special one, so to say, and the four special ones of the others; the\nnext is taste, the next colour, the next touch, and the last sound; each has\none quality less than its predecessor. See Yoga-sutra, p. 106, and gloss; _S_\na _n_ khya-sutra I, 62; and Vedanta Paribhasha, p. 45.\n\n[286:1](sbe0839.htm#fr_1377) These are mind and understanding; the fruits and\nflowers are here of 'undistinguished colours,' as the text expresses it, since\nthey include the colours of all the fruits of all the other five sets of\ntrees; that is to say, the subject-matter of their operations is sound, taste,\n&c., the subject-matters of all the senses together. 'Undistinguished colours'\nis, perhaps, more literally 'of colours not clear.' Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra\nparaphrases it by 'of variegated colours,' which is no doubt the true ultimate\nsense.\n\n[286:2](sbe0839.htm#fr_1378) The self, Nilaka _nth_ a. See [p.\n279](sbe0837.htm#page_279), note  [7](sbe0837.htm#fn_1336) supra.\n\n[286:3](sbe0839.htm#fr_1379) I. e., I presume, devoted to the Brahman.\n\n[286:4](sbe0839.htm#fr_1380) I. e. true knowledge, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[286:5](sbe0839.htm#fr_1381) See note  5, p. 285.\n\n[286:6](sbe0839.htm#fr_1382) I. e. when the senses having worked, as\nunconnected with the self, are finally absorbed into it. Cf. _S_ a _n_ khya-\nkarika 49 and Ka _th_ a, p. 151.\n\n[287:1](sbe0839.htm#fr_1383) It extends on all sides, its end cannot be\nperceived on any side.\n\n[287:2](sbe0839.htm#fr_1384) These are, according to Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, the\nMahat, Aha _n_ kara, and five Tanmatras. Their faces are turned downwards, as\nthey are obstacles in the way upwards, viz. the way of final emancipation;\nthey are brilliant, as they light up the course of worldly life; and hence,\ntoo, they are 'causes of generation.' They give birth to the universe.\n\n[287:3](sbe0839.htm#fr_1385) They conceal the higher delight of final\nemancipation.\n\n[287:4](sbe0839.htm#fr_1386) I follow Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, but the text is\ndoubtful.\n\n[287:5](sbe0839.htm#fr_1387) Viz. the Brahman.\n\n[287:6](sbe0839.htm#fr_1388) Cf. _Kh_ andogya, pp. 295-300. The word sages\nhere, as before, means the various organs. See B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 415.\n\n[287:7](sbe0839.htm#fr_1389) Glory = renown; brilliance = Brahmic splendour\n(Brahmate _g_ as); perfection = obtaining what is desired; power = not being\nconquered by others, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. About the sun, see line 3 of text\nabove.\n\n[287:8](sbe0839.htm#fr_1390) I. e. contentment. See the second line in the\ntext above.\n\n[287:9](sbe0839.htm#fr_1391) I. e. the space in the heart, the sacrifice being\nthat of 'concentration of mind,' yogaya _g_ \xc3\xb1a,--Nilaka _nth_ a. A confluence\nof rivers is very sacred--here the meaning intended seems to be the absorption\nof all desires by contentment into the heart.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIII](sbe0840.htm)\n\n"
