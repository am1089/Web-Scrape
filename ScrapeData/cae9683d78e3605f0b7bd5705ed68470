XX.\n\nKrishn\xcc\x81a and Balarama meet Kubja; she is made straight by the former: they\nproceed to the palace. Krishn\xcc\x81a breaks a bow intended for a trial of arms.\nKansa\'s orders to his servants. Public games. Krishn\xcc\x81a and his brother enter\nthe arena: the former wrestles with Chan\xcc\x81ura, the latter with Musht\xcc\x81ika, the\nking\'s wrestlers; who are both killed. Krishn\xcc\x81a attacks and slays Kansa: he\nand Balarama do homage to Vasudeva and Devaki: the former praises Krishn\xcc\x81a.\n\nAs they proceeded along the high road, they saw coming towards them a young\ngirl, who was crooked, carrying a pot of unguent. Krishn\xcc\x81a addressed her\nsportively, and said, "For whom are you carrying that unguent? tell me, lovely\nmaiden; tell me truly." Spoken to as it were through affection, Kubja, well\ndisposed towards Hari, replied to him also mirthfully, being smitten by his\nappearance; "Know you not, beloved, that I am the servant of Kansa, and\nappointed, crooked as I am, to prepare his perfumes. Unguent ground by any\nother he does not approve of: hence I am enriched through his liberal\nrewards." Then said Krishn\xcc\x81a, "Fair-faced damsel, give us of this unguent,\nfragrant and fit for kings, as much as we may rub upon our bodies." "Take it,"\nanswered Kubja.; and she gave them as much of the unguent as was sufficient\nfor their persons; and they rubbed it on various parts of their faces and\nbodies 1, till they looked like two clouds, one white and one black, decorated\nby the many-tinted bow of Indra. Then Krishn\xcc\x81a, skilled in the curative art,\ntook hold of her, under the chin, with the thumb and two fingers, and lifted\nup her head, whilst with his feet he pressed down her feet; and in this way he\nmade her straight. When she was thus relieved from her deformity, she was a\nmost beautiful woman; and, filled with gratitude and affection, she took\nGovinda by the garment, and invited him to her house. Promising to come at\nsome\n\np. 551\n\nother time, Krishn\xcc\x81a smilingly dismissed her, and then laughed aloud on\nbeholding the countenance of Baladeva 2.\n\nDressed in blue and yellow garments, and anointed with fragrant unguents,\nKe\xc5\x9bava and Rama proceeded to the hall of arms, which was hung round with\ngarlands. Inquiring of the warders which bow he was to try, and being directed\nto it, he took it, and bent it; but drawing it with violence, he snapped it in\ntwo 3, and all Mathura resounded with the noise which its fracture occasioned.\nAbused by the warders for breaking the bow, Krishn\xcc\x81a and Rama retorted, and\ndefied them, and left the hall.\n\nWhen Kansa knew that Akrura had returned, and heard that the bow had been\nbroken, he thus said to Chan\xcc\x81ura and Musht\xcc\x81ika, his boxers: "Two youths,\ncowherd boys, have arrived; you must kill them both, in a trial of strength,\nin my presence; for they practise against my life. I shall be well pleased if\nyou kill them in the match, and will give you whatever you wish; not else.\nThese two foes of mine must be killed by you fairly or unfairly. The kingdom\nshall be ours in common, when they have perished." Having given them these\norders, he sent next for his elephant driver, and desired him to station his\ngreat elephant Kuvalayapid\xcc\x81a, who was as vast as a cloud charged with rain,\nnear the gate of the arena, and drive him upon the two boys when they should\nattempt to enter. When Kansa had issued these commands, and ascertained that\nthe platforms were all ready for the spectators, he awaited the rising of the\nsun, unconscious of impending death.\n\nIn the morning the citizens assembled on the platforms set apart for them, and\nthe princes, with the ministers and courtiers, occupied the royal seats. Near\nthe centre of the circle judges of the games were stationed by Kansa, whilst\nhe himself sat apart close by upon a lofty throne. Separate platforms were\nerected for the ladies of the palace, for the courtesans, and for the wives of\nthe citizens 4. Nanda and the\n\np. 552\n\ncowherds had places appropriated to them, at the end of which sat Akrura and\nVasudeva. Amongst the wives of the citizens appeared\n\np. 553\n\n[paragraph continues] Devaki, mourning for her son, whose lovely face she\nlonged to behold even in the hour of his destruction. When the musical\ninstruments\n\np. 554\n\nsounded, Chan\xcc\x81ura sprang forth, and the people cried, "Alas!" and Musht\xcc\x81ika\nslapped his arms in defiance. Covered with must and blood\n\np. 555\n\nfrom the elephant, whom, when goaded upon them by his driver, they had slain,\nand armed with his tusks, Balabhadra and Janarddana confidently entered the\narena, like two lions amidst a herd of deer. Exclamations of pity arose from\nall the spectators, along with expressions of astonishment. "This then," said\nthe people, "is Krishn\xcc\x81a! this is Balabhadra! This is he by whom the fierce\nnight-walker Putana was slain; by whom the waggon was overturned, and the two\nArjuna trees\n\np. 556\n\nfelled! This is the boy who trampled and danced on the serpent Kaliya; who\nupheld the mountain Govarddhana for seven nights; who killed, as if in play,\nthe iniquitous Arisht\xcc\x81a, Dhenuka, and Ke\xc5\x9bin! This whom we see is Achyuta! This\nis he who has been foretold by the wise, skilled in the sense of the Puran\xcc\x81as,\nas Gopala, who shall exalt the depressed Yadava race! This is a portion of the\nall-existing, all-generating Vishn\xcc\x81u, descended upon earth, who will assuredly\nlighten her load!" Thus did the citizens describe Rama and Krishn\xcc\x81a, as soon\nas they appeared; whilst the breast of Devaki glowed with maternal affection;\nand Vasudeva, forgetting his infirmities, felt himself young again, on\nbeholding the countenances of his sons as a season of rejoicing. The women of\nthe palace, and the wives of the citizens, wide opened their eyes, and gazed\nintently upon Krishn\xcc\x81a. "Look, friends," said they to their companions; "look\nat the face of Krishn\xcc\x81a; his eyes are reddened by his conflict with the\nelephant, and the drops of perspiration stand upon his cheeks, outvieing a\nfull blown lotus in autumn, studded with glittering dew. Avail yourself now of\nthe faculty of vision. Observe his breast, the seat of splendour, marked with\nthe mystic sign; and his arms, menacing destruction to his foes. Do you not\nnotice Balabhadra, dressed in a blue garment; his countenance as fair as the\njasmine, as the moon, as the fibres of the lotus stem? See how he gently\nsmiles at the gestures of Musht\xcc\x81ika and Chan\xcc\x81ura, as they spring up. And now\nbehold Hari advance to encounter Chan\xcc\x81ura. What! are there no elders, judges\nof the field? How can the delicate form of Hari, only yet in the dawn of\nadolescence, be regarded as a match for the vast and adamantine bulk of the\ngreat demon? Two youths, of light and elegant persons, are in the arena, to\noppose athletic fiends, headed by the cruel Chan\xcc\x81ura. This is a great sin in\nthe judges of the games, for the umpires to suffer a contest between boys and\nstrong men."\n\nAs thus the women of the city conversed with one another, Hari, having\ntightened his girdle, danced in the ring, shaking the ground on which he trod.\nBalabhadra also danced, slapping his arms in defiance. Where the ground was\nfirm, the invincible Krishn\xcc\x81a contended foot to foot with Chan\xcc\x81ura. The\npractised demon Musht\xcc\x81ika was opposed by\n\np. 557\n\n[paragraph continues] Balabhadra. Mutually entwining, and pushing, and\npulling, and beating each other with fists, arms, and elbows, pressing each\nother with their knees, interlacing their arms, kicking with their feet,\npressing with their whole weight upon one another 5, fought Hari and Chan\xcc\x81ura.\nDesperate was the struggle, though without weapons, and one for life and\ndeath, to the great gratification of the spectators. In proportion as the\ncontest continued, so Chan\xcc\x81ura was gradually losing something of his original\nvigour, and the wreath upon his head trembled from his fury and distress 6;\nwhilst the world-comprehending Krishn\xcc\x81a wrestled with him as if but in sport.\nBeholding Chan\xcc\x81ura losing, and Krishn\xcc\x81a gaining strength, Kansa, furious with\nrage, commanded the music to cease. As soon as the drums and trumpets were\nsilenced, a numerous band of heavenly instruments was heard in the sky, and\nthe gods invisibly exclaimed, "Victory to Govinda! Ke\xc5\x9bava, kill the demon\nChan\xcc\x81ura!" Madhusudana having for a long time dallied with his adversary, at\nlast lifted him up, and whirled him round, with the intention of putting an\nend to him. Having whirled Chan\xcc\x81ura round a hundred times, until his breath\nwas expended in the air, Krishn\xcc\x81a dashed him on the ground with such violence\nas to smash his body into a hundred fragments, and strew the earth with a\nhundred pools of gory mire. Whilst this took place, the mighty Baladeva was\nengaged in the same manner with the demon bruiser Musht\xcc\x81ika. Striking him on\nthe head with his fists, and on the\n\np. 558\n\nbreast with his knees, he stretched him on the ground, and pummelled him there\ntill he was dead. Again, Krishn\xcc\x81a encountered the royal bruiser Tomalaka, and\nfelled him to the earth with a blow of his left hand. When the other athletae\nsaw Chan\xcc\x81ura, Musht\xcc\x81ika, and Tomalaka killed, they fled from the field; and\nKrishn\xcc\x81a and Sankarshan\xcc\x81a danced victorious on the arena, dragging along with\nthem by force the cowherds of their own age. Kansa, his eyes reddening with\nwrath, called aloud to the surrounding people, "Drive those two cow-boys out\nof the assembly: seize the villain Nanda, and secure him with chains of iron:\nput Vasudeva to death with tortures intolerable to his years: and lay hands\nupon the cattle, and whatever else belongs to those cowherds who are the\nassociates of Krishn\xcc\x81a."\n\nUpon hearing these orders, the destroyer of Madhu laughed at Kansa, and,\nspringing up to the place where he was seated, laid hold of him by the hair of\nhis head, and struck his tiara to the ground: then casting him down upon the\nearth, Govinda threw himself upon him. Crushed by the weight of the upholder\nof the universe, the son of Ugrasena, Kansa the king, gave up the ghost.\nKrishn\xcc\x81a then dragged the dead body, by the hair of the head, into the centre\nof the arena, and a deep furrow was made by the vast and heavy carcass of\nKansa, when it was dragged along the ground by Krishn\xcc\x81a, as if a torrent of\nwater had run through it 7. Seeing Kansa thus treated, his brother Sumalin\ncame to his succour; but he was encountered, and easily killed, by Balabhadra.\nThen arose a general cry of grief from the surrounding circle, as they beheld\nthe king of Mathura thus slain, and treated with such contumely, by Krishn\xcc\x81a.\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, accompanied by Balabhadra, embraced the feet of Vasudeva and of\nDevaki; but Vasudeva raised him up; and he and Devaki recalling to\nrecollection what he had said to them at his birth, they bowed to Janarddana,\nand the former thus addressed him: "Have compassion upon mortals, O god,\nbenefactor and lord of deities: it is by thy favour to us two that thou hast\nbecome the (present) upholder of the\n\np. 559\n\nworld. That, for the punishment of the rebellious, thou hast descended upon\nearth in my house, having been propitiated by my prayers, sanctifies our race.\nThou art the heart of all creatures; thou abidest in all creatures; and all\nthat has been, or will be, emanates from thee, O universal spirit! Thou,\nAchyuta, who comprehendest all the gods, art eternally worshipped with\nsacrifices: thou art sacrifice itself, and the offerer of sacrifices. The\naffection that inspires my heart and the heart of Devaki towards thee, as if\nthou wast our child, is indeed but error, and a great delusion. How shall the\ntongue of a mortal such as I am call the creator of all things, who is without\nbeginning or end, son? Is it consistent that the lord of the world, from whom\nthe world proceeds, should be born of me, except through illusion? How should\nhe, in whom all fixed and moveable things are contained, be conceived in the\nwomb and born of a mortal being? Have compassion therefore indeed, O supreme\nlord, and in thy descended portions protect the universe. Thou art no son of\nmine. This whole world, from Brahma to a tree, thou art. Wherefore dost thou,\nwho art one with the supreme, beguile us? Blinded by delusion, I thought thee\nmy son; and for thee, who art beyond all fear, I dreaded the anger of Kansa,\nand therefore did I take thee in my terror to Gokula, where thou hast grown\nup; but I no longer claim thee as mine own. Thou, Vishn\xcc\x81u, the sovereign lord\nof all, whose actions Rudra, the Maruts, the A\xc5\x9bwins, Indra, and the gods,\ncannot equal, although they behold them; thou who hast come amongst us for the\nbenefit of the world, art recognised, and delusion is no more."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[550:1](vp137.htm#fr_1511) They had their bodies smeared in the style called\nBhaktichheda; that is, with the separating or distinguishing (chheda) marks of\nVaishn\xcc\x81ava devotion (bhakti): certain streaks on the forehead, nose, cheeks,\nbreast, and arms, which denote a follower of Vishn\xcc\x81u. See As. Res. XVI. 33.\n\n[551:2](vp137.htm#fr_1512) The story is similarly told in the Bhagavata, &c.\n\n[551:3](vp137.htm#fr_1513) The bending or breaking of a bow is a favourite\nincident in Hindu heroic poetry, borrowed, no doubt, from the Ramayan\xcc\x81a,\nwhere, however, it has an object; here it is quite gratuitous.\n\n[551:4](vp137.htm#fr_1514) The Bhagavata enters into even fewer p. 552\nparticulars than our text of the place set apart for the games. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba\ngives a much more detailed description, which is in some respects curious. The\nwant of any technical glossary, and the general manner in which technical\nterms are explained in the ordinary dictionaries, render it difficult to\nunderstand exactly what is intended, and any translation of the passages must\nbe defective. The French version, however, probably represents a much more\nsplendid and theatrical scene than the text authorizes, and may therefore\nadmit of correction. The general plan is nothing more than an enclosed space,\nsurrounded by temporary structures of timber or bambus, open or enclosed, and\ndecorated with hangings and garlands. It may be doubted if the details\ndescribed by the compiler of the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba were very familiar even to him;\nfor his description is not always very consistent or precise. Of two\ncommentators, one evidently knows nothing of what he attempts to explain; but\nwith the assistance of the other the passages may be thus, though not always\nconfidently, rendered:--\n\n"The king, Kansa, meditating on these things, went forth from his palace to\nthe place which had been prepared for the sight of the ceremonial (1), to\ninspect the scaffolds (2) which had been constructed. He found the place close\nset with the several platforms (3) of the different public bodies (4),\nstrongly put together, and decorated with roofed pavilions of various sizes,\nsupported by columns, and divided into commodious chambers (5). The edifice\nwas extensive, well arranged, secured by strong rafters (6), spacious and\nlofty, and commodious and secure. Stairs led to the different galleries (7).\nChairs of state (8) were placed in various parts of it. The avenues that\nconducted to it were narrow (9). It was covered with temporary stages and\nsheds (10), and was capable of sustaining the weight of a multitude.\n\n"Having seen the place of the festival thus adorned, Kansa gave orders, and\nsaid, \'To-morrow let the platforms and terraces and pavilions (11) be\ndecorated with pictures and garlands and flags and images (12), and let them\nbe scented with fragrant odours, and covered over with awnings (13). Let there\nbe ample heaps of dry, pounded cow-dung (14) provided on the ground, and\nsuitable refreshment chambers be covered over, and decorated with bells and\nornamented arches (15). Let large water jars be securely fixed in order,\ncapable of holding a copious supply, and provided with golden drinking-cups.\nLet apartments be prepared (16), and various kinds of beverage, in appropriate\nvessels, be ready. Let judges of the games be invited, and corporations with\ntheir chiefs. Let orders be issued to the wrestlers, and notice be given to\nthe spectators; and let platforms for their accommodation be fitted up in the\nplace of assembly.\'" (17)\n\nWhen the meeting takes place, the site of the games is thus described: "Upon\nthe following day the amphitheatre (18) was filled by the citizens, anxious to\nbehold the games. The place of [assembly](errata.htm#22) (19) was supported by\noctagonal painted pillars (20), p. 553 fitted up with terraces and doors and\nbolts, with windows circular or crescent; shaped, and accommodated with seats\nwith cushions (21), and it shone like the ocean whilst large clouds hang upon\nit, with spacious, substantial pavilions (22), fitted up for the sight of the\ncombat; open to the front (23), but screened with beautiful and fine curtains\n(24), crowned with festoons of flowers, and glistening with radiance like\nautumnal clouds. The pavilions of the different companies and corporations,\nvast as mountains, were decorated with banners, bearing upon them the\nimplements and emblems of the several crafts (25). The chambers of the\ninhabitants of the inner apartments shone near at hand, bright with gold and\npainting and net-work of gems: they were richly decorated with precious\nstones, were enclosed below with costly hangings, and ornamented above with\nspires and banners, and looked like mountains spreading their wings in the\nsky; while the rays of light reflected from the valuable jewels were blended\nwith the waving of white chowries, and the musical tinkling of female\nornaments. The separate pavilions of the courtesans were graced by lovely\nwomen, attired in the most splendid dresses (27), and emulated the radiance of\nthe cars of the gods. In the place of assembly there were excellent seats,\ncouches made of gold, and hangings of various colours, intermixed with bunches\nof flowers: and there were golden vases of water, and handsome places for\nrefreshment, filled with fruits of various kinds, and cooling juices, and\nsherbets fit for drinking (28). And there were many other stages and\nplatforms, constructed of strong timber, and hangings by hundreds and\nthousands were displayed: and upon the tops of the houses, chambers fitted up\nwith delicate jalousies, through which the women might behold the sports,\nappeared like swans flying through the air.\n\n"In front stood the pavilion of Kansa, surpassing all the rest in splendour,\nlooking like mount Meru in radiance; its sides, its columns, being covered\nwith burnished gold; fastened with coloured cords; and every way worthy the\npresence of a king."\n\nIn justification of the rendering of the above, an explanation of the\ntechnical terms, taken either from dictionaries or from the commentators, may\nbe subjoined. (1) Kansa went to the Prekshagara, literally \'house of seeing;\'\nbut it is evident, from its interior being visible to spectators on the tops\nof the houses, as subsequently mentioned, that it was not a theatre, or\ncovered edifice. If a building at all, it was merely a sort of stockade. One\ncommentator calls it, \'a place made for seeing the sacrifice;\' (2) Manchanam\navalokaka. The Mancha is commonly understood to signify a raised platform,\nwith a floor and a roof, ascended by a ladder: see Dictionary. (3) Mancha-\nvat\xcc\x81a. Vat\xcc\x81a is either \'site\' or \'inclosure,\' and is used here without much\naffecting the sense of Mancha. The compound is explained by the commentators,\n\'prepared places\', or \'the sites of the platforms\'. (4) The \xc5\x9aren\xcc\x81i\xc5\x9b,\nassociations p. 554 of artificers practising the same art. One of the\ncommentaries understands the term to be here used to denote, not their\nstation, but their labours: \'The structure was the work of the artificers.\'\n(5) Several words occur here of technical import. The passage is, ###. Valabhi\nis said by the commentator to mean a structure with a pent roof, supported by\nsix columns. Kut\xcc\x81i, a circular one, having seven roofs--something perhaps like\na Chinese pagoda--and four columns. The Eka-stambha is a chamber, supported by\none column. (6) Saraniryyuham. It is difficult to understand the necessity of\nrafters in an inclosure in which the platforms and stages seem to have been\nerected independently of any floor or wall: but the commentary explains\nNiryyuha, \'strong brackets, projecting from a house:\' (7) Aslisht\xcc\x81a sushsht\xcc\x81a\nmancharohanam. The first epithet is explained, \'not contracted\'; the second,\n\'well constructed\'; and for the \'ascending\' (\xc3\x81rohanam) we have \'where was a\nline of steps\' or \'ladders\' There is another reading of the text, however,\nwhich may be rendered, \'Having steps well secured in their ascent above\'. (8)\n\'Seats for kings\'. (9) Such is the literal purport of Sanchara-patha-sankulam;\nimplying, possibly, the formation of passages by fences on either side. (10)\nThis is doubtful: the phrase is Chhannam-tad-vedikabhi. Chhannam means,\nliterally, \'covered,\' and can scarcely be used in the sense of \'overspread or\nfilled with.\' Vedika means an elevated floor or terrace, with which a hall or\nedifice cannot well be \'covered;\' and therefore requires the sense here given\nto Chhanna. The commentators are silent. (11) The Manchavat\xcc\x81as and Valabhis,\nas above: the other term is Vithi, \'a shop,\' \'a stall,\' \'a terrace,\' \'a road.\'\n(12) Let them be Vapushmanta; \'having painted or sculptured figures\'. The\nother commentary renders it merely \'pleasant\' or \'agreeable\'. (13) \'Covered\nabove with cloths\'. The use of the awning or Semiana is very common in India.\n(14) For the wrestlers to rub over their bodies to absorb the perspiration\n(15) This is all rather questionable: the passage is most usually, ###. Vali\nor Bali in one sense means \'the edge of a thatch,\' and may be put for some\nsort of temporary structure, a kind of retiring or refreshment room for the\nboxers and wrestlers. In some copies it is read, \'beautiful with cloths\nspread,\' on which the performers may sit when disengaged; perhaps a sort of\ncarpet on the ground. (16) The expression is again Vali. Another sense of the\nword is, offering of viands, or of the remains of a sacrifice, to all beings;\nbut that cannot be its purport here; nor is it ever used in the sense of\nviands in general. The verb Kalpa or Klrip also usually p. 555 implies\n\'making.\' (17) Manchavat\xcc\x81a; \'in the Samaja,\' or \'assembly.\' (18) Maharanga,\n\'the great place of the performance.\' Ranga is \'acting\' or \'representation;\'\nalso the place or site of it. (19) All the copies consulted, except one, offer\nan irregularity of construction, which, although defended by the commentators,\nis a license scarcely allowable. The epithets of the first verse are all in\nthe plural number; they then occur in the singular, to agree with the only\nsubstantive in the description, Samajavat\xcc\x81a. According to the commentaries,\nthe plural term Manchas understood is the substantive to the epithets of the\nfirst stanza, and Samajavat\xcc\x81a the singular to those of the other verses. This\nawkwardness is however avoided by the reading of an old and very good copy,\nwhich puts it all in the singular; as ### (20) The expression is Charan\xcc\x81a,\nliterally \'foot;\' explained by the commentator, Stambha, \'post\' or \'pillar\'\n(21) The reading of most of the copies is \xc5\x9aayanottama, which may be taken as\nthe sense of Talottama, \'couches or benches with cushions.\' (22) Manchagarais,\n\'temporary houses.\' (21) Or \'fronting to the east\'. (24) Nirmuktais: explained\nby the commentator to mean \'fine threads,\' \'network,\' or \'gauze,\' through\nwhich persons, females especially, may see without being seen. (25) ### (26)\n\'With ridges and projections\'. The commentator explains this, \'with flags on\nthe top of them.\' (27) This appears to be intended for an epithet of the\nwomen, although \xc3\x81staran\xcc\x81a is not usually applied to dress. (28) Phala, of\ncourse, is \'fruit.\' Avadan\xc5\x9ba is explained in lexicons, what is eaten to excite\nthirst:\' one comment gives it, what may be sucked,\' as tamarinds, and the\nlike. Changeri is explained, \'fluids for drinking, made with sorrel, or acid\nfruits;\' that is, sherbets. (29) ### is an epithet of the Prekshagara, or\nlook-out house of the women, situated on the tops of their houses, according\nto the commentators; an arrangement very compatible with the form of Indian\nhouses, which have flat roofs, commonly enclosed by a trellis work, or\njalousie of masonry. It is observable, that in the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a, and in the\nMahabharata, on various public occasions, the women take their places on the\nplatforms, or in the pavilions, without curtains or screens.\n\n[557:5](vp137.htm#fr_1515) The terms here used are technical, and refer to the\nestablished modes of wrestling amongst Hindu athletae. 1. Sannipata is\ndescribed \'mutual laying hold of.\' 2. Avaduta, \'letting go of the adversary.\'\ng. Kshepan\xcc\x81a, \'pulling to, and casting back.\' 4. Musht\xcc\x81inipata, \'striking with\nfists.\' 5. Kilanipata, \'striking with the elbow.\' 6. Vajranipata, \'striking\nwith the fore-arm.\' 7. Janunirghata, \'pressing or striking with the knees.\' 8.\nBahuvighat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81ana, \'interlacing the arms.\' 9. Padoddhuta, kicking.\' 10.\nPrasrisht\xcc\x81a, \'intertwining of the whole body.\' In some copies another term\noccurs, A\xc5\x9bmanirghata, \'striking with stones,\' or \'striking blows as hard as\nwith stones;\' for stones could scarcely be used in a contest specified as \'one\nwithout weapons\'\n\n[557:6](vp137.htm#fr_1516) Krishn\xcc\x81a contended with Chan\xcc\x81ura, \'who through\ndistress and anger shook the flowers of his crest;\' The two last terms are\nexplained, the flower of the wreath on his head.\'\n\n[558:7](vp137.htm#fr_1517) Et latus mediam sulcus diducit arenam.\n\n\'The yielding sand being furrowed into a ditch or a water-course, by the dead\nbodies being dragged over it.
