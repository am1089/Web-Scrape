The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_ apati,\nwere contending for superiority. Then the gods were worsted, and the Asuras\nthought: \'To us alone assuredly belongs this world!\n\n1:2:5:22\\. They thereupon said: \'Well then, let us divide this world between\nus; and having divided it, let us subsist thereon!\' They accordingly set about\ndividing it with ox-hides from west to east.\n\n1:2:5:33\\. The gods then heard of this, and said: \'The Asuras are actually\ndividing this earth: come, let us go to where the Asuras are dividing it. For\nwhat would become of us, if we were to get no share in it?\' Placing Vish _n_\nu, (in the shape of) this very sacrifice, at their head, they went (to the\nAsuras).\n\n1:2:5:44\\. They then said: \'Let us share in this earth along with yourselves!\nLet a part of it be ours!\' The Asuras replied rather grudgingly: \'As much as\nthis Vish _n_ u lies upon, and no more, we give you!\'\n\n1:2:5:55\\. Now Vish _n_ u was a dwarf 1. The gods, however,\n\np. 60\n\nwere not offended at this, but said: \'Much indeed they gave us, who gave us\nwhat is equal in size to the sacrifice.\'\n\n1:2:5:66\\. Having then laid him down eastwards, they enclosed him on all\n(three) sides with the metres, saying (Va _g_. S. I, 27), on the south side,\n\'With the Gayatri metre I enclose thee!\' on the west side: \'With the Trish _t_\nubh metre I enclose thee!\' on the north side: \'With the _G_ agati metre I\nenclose thee 1!\'\n\n1:2:5:77\\. Having thus enclosed him on all (three) sides, and having placed\nAgni (the fire) on the east side, they went on worshipping and toiling with it\n(or him, i.e. Vish _n_ u, the sacrifice). By it they obtained (sam-vid) this\nentire earth; and because they obtained by it this entire (earth), therefore\nit (the sacrificial ground) is called vedi (the altar). For this reason they\nsay, \'As great as the altar is, so great is the earth;\' for by it (the altar)\nthey obtained this entire (earth). And, verily, he who so understands this,\nwrests likewise this entire (earth) from his rivals, excludes his rivals from\nsharing in it.\n\n1:2:5:88\\. Thereupon this Vish _n_ u became tired; but being enclosed on all\n(three) sides by the metres, with the\n\np. 61\n\nfire on the east, there was no (means of) escaping: he then hid himself among\nthe roots of plants.\n\n1:2:5:99\\. The gods said: \'What has become of Vish _n_ u? What has become of\nthe sacrifice?\' They said: \'On all (three) sides he is enclosed by the metres,\nwith Agni to the east, there is no (way of) escaping: search for him in this\nvery place!\' By slightly digging they accordingly searched for him. They\ndiscovered him at a depth of three inches (or thumb\'s breadths): therefore the\naltar should be three inches deep; and therefore also Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ i 1 made the\naltar for the Soma-sacrifice three inches deep.\n\n1:2:5:1010\\. This, however, one must not do. Among the roots of the plants he\n(Vish _n_ u) hid himself: therefore let him (the Adhvaryu) bid (the \xc3\x82gnidhra)\nto cut out the roots of the plants. And since they found (anu-vid) Vish _n_ u\nin that place, therefore it is called vedi (altar).\n\n1:2:5:1111\\. When they had found him, they enclosed him with a second\nenclosure, saying (Va _g_. S. I, 27), \'Of good soil art thou, and auspicious\nart thou!\' on the south side; for when they had thus obtained this earth they\nmade it of good soil and auspicious;--\'Pleasant art thou, and soft to sit\nupon!\' they said on the west side, for when they had thus obtained this earth,\nthey made it pleasant and soft to sit upon;--\'Abounding in food and drink art\nthou!\' they said on the north side, for when they had thus obtained this\nearth, they made it abounding in food and drink.\n\np. 62\n\n1:2:5:1212\\. Threefold 1 he draws round the first line of enclosure, threefold\nthe second: hence sixfold (the two); for six seasons there are in the year,\nand the year, as Pra _g_ apati (Lord of Creation), is the sacrifice 2. As\nlarge as the sacrifice, as wide as its extent is, so wide does he thereby\nenclose it.\n\n1:2:5:1313\\. With six sacred words 3 he draws around the first line of\nenclosure, with six the second: thus (together) twelvefold, for twelve no\ndoubt are the months of the year; and the year, as Pra _g_ apati, is the\nsacrifice. As large as the sacrifice, as wide as its extent is, so wide does\nhe thereby enclose it.\n\n1:2:5:1414\\. \'Let it (the altar) measure a fathom 4 across on the west side,\'\nthey say: that, namely, is the size of a man, and it (the altar) should be of\n(the) man\'s size. \'Three cubits long (should be) the\n\np. 63\n\n[paragraph continues] "easterly line 1," for threefold is the sacrifice,\' (so\nthey say, but) in this there is no (fixed) measure: let him make it as long as\nhe thinks fit in his own mind!\n\n1:2:5:1515\\. The two shoulders (of the altar) he carries along both sides of\nthe (\xc3\x82havaniya) fire. For the altar (vedi, fem.) is female and the fire (agni,\nmasc.) is male; and the woman lies embracing the man: thereby a copulation\nproductive of offspring is obtained. For this reason he carries the two\nshoulders (of the altar) along both sides of the fire.\n\n1:2:5:1616\\. It (the altar) should be broader on the west side, contracted in\nthe middle, and broad again on the east side; for thus shaped they praise a\nwoman: \'broad about the hips, somewhat narrower between the shoulders, and\ncontracted in the middle (or, about the waist).\' Thereby he makes it (the\naltar) pleasing to the gods.\n\n1:2:5:1717\\. It should be sloping towards east, for the east is the quarter of\nthe gods; and also sloping towards north, for the north is the quarter of men.\nTo the south side he sweeps the rubbish (loose soil), for that is the quarter\nof the deceased ancestors. If it (the altar) were sloping towards south, the\nsacrificer would speedily go to yonder world; and thus (by making the altar in\nthe prescribed way) the sacrificer lives for a long time: for this reason he\nsweeps the loose soil to the south side. Let\n\np. 64\n\nhim then cover it (the altar) over with (fresh) rubbish: for rubbish means\ncattle, and well-stocked with cattle he thereby makes it 1.\n\n1:2:5:1818\\. He (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) smooths it down (from east to west). The gods,\nnamely, when they were preparing for the contest, said to one another: \'Come,\nlet us remove to the moon for safety what imperishable place of worship there\nis on this earth; so that if the Asuras, on vanquishing us, should drive us\naway from here, we may afterwards, by praising and mortifying, prevail again!\'\nThey accordingly removed to the moon what imperishable place of worship there\nwas on this earth. That now is the black (spots) in the moon: hence they say,\n\'In the moon is the place of worship for this earth.\' It is in this place of\nworship also that his sacrifice is performed: for that reason he smooths (the\naltar) down 2.\n\n1:2:5:1919\\. He smooths it down, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 28): \'Before the\nbloody (battle) with its rushings hither and thither 3, O mighty one!\' the\nbloody one no doubt is the battle, for in battle\n\np. 65\n\nbloody deeds are done, and slain lie man and horse; and before that battle\nthey removed it (the altar to the moon); therefore he says, \'Before the bloody\n(battle) with its rushings hither and thither, O mighty one!\'--\'lifting up the\nlife-bestowing earth,\' for after lifting up what was living on this earth,\nthey removed it to the moon; therefore he says, \'lifting  up the life-\nbestowing earth; which they raised to the moon by prayers,\' \'which they placed\nin the moon by worship,\' he thereby says,--\'that (earth) the wise still point\nout and worship,\' to that they accordingly address their worship; and the\noffering of him also who so understands this, is performed in that place of\nworship.\n\n1:2:5:2020\\. He now says (to the \xc3\x82gnidhra; Va _g_. S. I, 28), \'Put the\nsprinkling-water down (on the altar)!\' That thunderbolt, the wooden sword, and\nthe priest (brahma _n_ a) have hitherto defended that sacrifice. Now the water\nalso is a thunderbolt: that thunderbolt he thereby lays down for its defence.\nWhile the sprinkling-water is being held close above the wooden sword, he\ntakes up the latter. If he were to set the sprinkling-water down, while the\nwooden sword is still lying, the two thunderbolts would come into collision\nwith each other; but in this way the two thunderbolts do not come into\ncollision with each other: for that reason he takes up the wooden sword, while\nthe sprinkling-water is being held close above it.\n\n1:2:5:2121\\. He pronounces this (entire) speech:--\'Put the sprinkling-water\ndown (on the altar)! put fuel and barhis (sacrificial grass) beside it! wipe\nthe ladles! gird the (sacrificer\'s) wife! come hither with the clarified\nbutter!\' This is a direction (given to\n\np. 66\n\nthe \xc3\x82gnidhra); he (the Adhvaryu) may pronounce it, if he choose; or, if he so\nchoose, he may omit it: for he (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) himself knows that this work has\nnow to be done.\n\n1:2:5:2222\\. He then flings the wooden sword northwards (on the heap of\nrubbish). If he wishes to exorcise 1, (he does so), with the text, \'I fling\nthee as a thunderbolt for so and so!\' and as a thunderbolt the wooden sword\naccordingly strikes down (the enemy).\n\n1:2:5:2323\\. He then washes his hands 2; for what there was bloody (or\ninjured) on it (the altar) that he thereby removes from it: that is why he\nwashes his hands.\n\n1:2:5:2424\\. Now those who made offerings in former times, touched (the altar\nand oblations) at this particular time, while they were sacrificing. They\nbecame more sinful. Those who washed (their hands) became righteous. Then\nunbelief took hold of men: \'Those who sacrifice become more sinful, and those\nwho sacrifice not become righteous,\' they said. No sacrificial food then came\nto the gods from this world: for the gods subsist on what is offered up from\nthis world 3.\n\n1:2:5:2525\\. The gods thereupon said to B _ri_ haspati \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa, \'Verily,\nunbelief has come upon men; ordain thou the sacrifice to them!\' B _ri_ haspati\n\xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa then went and said, \'How comes it that you do not sacrifice?\' They\nreplied, \'From a desire for what\n\np. 67\n\nshould we sacrifice, since those who sacrifice become more sinful, and those\nwho sacrifice not become righteous?\'\n\n1:2:5:2626\\. B _ri_ haspati \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa then said, \'What we have heard of as\nproduced 1 for the gods that is this sacrifice, that is to say, the cooked\noblations and the prepared altar; therewith you have performed while touching:\nthat is why you have become more sinful. Sacrifice therefore without touching,\nfor thus you will become righteous!\' \'How long?\' they asked. \'Till the\nspreading of the sacrificial grass (on the altar),\' he said. By the\nsacrificial grass, namely, it (the altar) becomes appeased. If, therefore,\nbefore the spreading of the sacrificial grass anything were to fall on it, let\nhim only remove it at the time when he spreads the sacrificial grass; for when\nthey spread the sacrificial grass, then they also step on it with the foot. He\nwho knowing this sacrifices without touching, becomes indeed righteous: let\nhim therefore sacrifice, without touching (the altar and oblations).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[59:1](sbe1211.htm#fr_192) This legend is given in Muir\'s Original Sanskrit\nTexts, IV, p. 122, where it is pointed out that we have here the germ of the\nDwarf Incarnation of Vish _n_ u; and in A. Kuhn\'s treatise, \'Ueber\nEntwickelungsstufen der Mythenbildung,\' p. 128, where the following remarks\nare made on the story: \'Here also we meet with the same struggle between light\nand darkness: the gods of light are vanquished and obtain from the Asuras, who\ndivide the earth between themselves, only as much room as is covered by Vish\n_n_ u, who measures the atmosphere with his three steps. He represents (though\nI cannot prove it in this place) the sun-light, which, on shrinking into\ndwarf\'s size in the evening, is the only means of preservation that is left to\nthe gods, who cover him with metres, i.e. with sacred hymns (probably in order\nto defend him from the powers of darkness), and in the end kindle Agni in the\neast--the dawn--and thereby once more obtain possession of the earth.\' Compare\nalso the corresponding legend in Taitt. Br. III, 2, 9, 7, p. 60 where the gods\nare granted by the Asuras as much as they can enclose; and by the Vasus being\nplaced in the south, the Rudras in the west, the \xc3\x82dityas in the north, and\nAgni in the east, they obtain the whole of the earth.\n\n[60:1](sbe1211.htm#fr_193) In the actual performance of the sacrifice this\nrepresents the purva-parigraha, or first enclosing of the altar by a single\nline being drawn with the wooden sword on each of the three sides (viz. S.W.\nto S.E.; S.W. to N.W.; N.W. to N.E.) whilst muttering the respective texts.\nBefore doing so he has, however, to ask and receive the permission of the\nBrahman, mutatis mutandis, in the usual way (cf. p. 7 note): the same forms\nhave to be gone through at the marking of the second and third enclosures.\nKaty. II, 6, 25 seq. On the ritualistic application of the metres, see note on\nI, 3, 2, 9.\n\n[61:1](sbe1211.htm#fr_194) This teacher is mentioned again, _S_ at. Br. II, 1,\n4, 27, along with two others, viz. \xc3\x82suri and Madhuki, but nothing further is\nknown of him. According to the Black Ya _g_ us the altar is made four (not\nthree) a\xe1\xb9\x85gulas deep.\n\n[62:1](sbe1211.htm#fr_195) Viz. each enclosing line consists of three\ndivisions corresponding to the three sides (S., W., N.) of the altar.\n\n[62:2](sbe1211.htm#fr_196) Pra _g_ apati (Lord of Creation) is here, as\nelsewhere, identified with the year (probably as the representative of the\neternal process of regeneration) and consequently with the annual cycle of\nsacrificial performance, or the sacrifice itself. Cf. _S_ at. Br. I, 5, 2, 16;\nX, 4, 3, 1.\n\n[62:3](sbe1211.htm#fr_197) According to Saya _n_ a, because each of the three\nmantras, \'gayatre _n_ a (traish _t_ ubhena, _g_ agatena resp.) tva _kh_ andasa\npari g _ri_ h _n_ ami,\' consists of two parts, the first ending with tva, the\nsecond with g _ri_ h _n_ ami, which makes together six. Similarly with the\nsecond triad of mantras. In the former case the Taittiriya text (Taitt. S. I,\n1, 9, 3), \'The Vasus may enclose thee with the Gayatri metre, the Rudras with\nthe Trish _t_ ubh metre, the \xc3\x82dityas with the _G_ agati metre!\' would furnish\na more natural explanation of the six sacred words.\n\n[62:4](sbe1211.htm#fr_198) Vyama, the space between the extreme ends of the\noutstretched arms. It is doubtful whether it is here intended for a fixed\nmeasure, or whether it is a relative one, depending on the size of the\nrespective sacrificer. The size of a man was supposed to be equal to the\nextent of his outstretched arms.\n\n[63:1](sbe1211.htm#fr_199) I.e. a line drawn from the middle of the western\nside through the centre of the altar to the \xc3\x82havaniya fire. The same line\nprolongated from the western side of the altar westwards to the Garhapatya\nwould measure eight (eleven or twelve) steps (prakrama or vikrama, of two feet\nor pada each) from fire to fire. See I, 7, 3, 23-25.\n\n[64:1](sbe1211.htm#fr_200) Purisha, rubbish; \'sandy or gravel-like soil,\' Say.\non Taitt. Br. III, 2, 9, 12; purisha also means \'faeces, manure,\' in which\nsense it is probably taken symbolically for \'cattle.\' The Taitt. Br. better:\n\'well supplied with cattle he thereby makes him (the sacrificer).\'\n\n[64:2](sbe1211.htm#fr_201) ? By stroking along the altar he shifts it to the\nmoon.\n\n[64:3](sbe1211.htm#fr_202) The interpretation of pura krurasya vis _ri_ pa _h_\nhere given by the author, and also by Mahidhara on Va _g_. S. I, 28, is more\nthan doubtful. Saya _n_ a on Taitt. S. I, 1, 9 is probably more correct in\ntaking pura vis _ri_ pa _h_ (abl. or gerund) krurasya to mean \'before the\nsneaking away of the cruel enemy (Araru, lying fettered on the heap of\nrubbish)\'--he supplies: \'thou, O altar, containest merely the divine\noblations, but since his removal thou containest everything.\' Cf. also Weber,\nInd. Streifen, II, p. 463.\n\n[66:1](sbe1211.htm#fr_203) Otherwise he uses the text (Va _g_. S. I, 28): \'A\nkiller of the enemy art thou!\' Katy. II, 6, 42.\n\n[66:2](sbe1211.htm#fr_204) He does so (on the utkara) and then lays down the\nwooden sword west of the pra _n_ ita water. Katy. II, 6, 43.\n\n[66:3](sbe1211.htm#fr_205) Men, on the other hand, subsist on what is bestowed\non them from yonder world. Taitt. S. III, 2, 9, 7; Taitt. Br. II, 2, 7, 3.\n\n[67:1](sbe1211.htm#fr_206) Parishutam, which Saya _n_ a interprets by parig\n_ri_ hitam, \'hedged round\' [? \'set apart\']. The Ka _n_ va MS. reads\nparishutam.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 1. Third Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe1212.htm)\n\n'
