The Hot _ri_  [1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:1:1) goes forward\n[2](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:1:2) (in order to fulfil) his duty by his wonderful\npower, directing upwards the brightly adorned prayer. He steps towards the\n(sacrificial) ladles which are turned to the right\n[3](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:1:3) and which first kiss his foundation\n[4](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:1:4).\n\n2\\. They have greeted with shouts the streams of _Ri_ ta\n[1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:2:1) which were hidden at the birthplace of the god,\nat his seat. When He dwelt dispersed in the lap of the waters, he drank the\ndraughts by (the power of) which he moves [2](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:2:2).\n\n3\\. Two (beings) of the same age [1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:3:1) try to draw\nthat wonderful shape (Agni) towards themselves, progressing in turns towards a\ncommon aim [2](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:3:2). Then he is to be proclaimed by us\nlike a winner [3](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:3:3) (in a contest). The charioteer\n[4](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:3:4) (governs all things) as if pulling in the reins\nof a draught-horse.\n\n4\\. He whom two (beings) of the same age [1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:4:1) serve,\ntwo twins dwelling together in one common abode, the gray one has been born as\na youth by night as by day [2](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:4:2), the ageless one who\nwanders through many generations of men.\n\n5\\. The prayers, the ten fingers [1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:5:1) stir him up.\nWe, the mortals, call him, the god, for his protection. From the dry land he\nhastens to the declivities [2](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:5:2). With those who\napproached him he has established new rules [3](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:5:3).\n\n6\\. Thou indeed, O Agni, reignest by thy own nature over the heavenly and over\nthe terrestrial\n\np. 161\n\nworld as a shepherd (takes care of his cattle). These two variegated, great\n(goddesses) striving for gloriousness, the golden ones who move crookedly\n[1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:6:1), have approached thy sacrificial grass.\n\n7\\. Agni! Be gratified and accept graciously this prayer, O joy-giver,\nindependent one, who art born in the _Ri_ ta, good-willed one, whose face is\nturned towards us from all sides, conspicuous one, gay in thy aspect, like a\ndwelling-place rich in food [1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:7:1).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, _G_ agati.--No verse occurs in the other Sa _m_\nhitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The Hot _ri_ is Agni.\n\nNote 2. Comp. III, 27, 7, where it is said of Agni: purastat eti mayaya.--The\npoet says eti pra, and not pra eti, in order to avoid the hiatus.\n\nNote 3. Comp. below, III, 6, 1. dakshi _n_ a-va\xc2\xb4 _t_.\n\nNote 4. 'Which first, i. e. at the time when the sacrificial vessels are put\ndown, kiss his dhaman (foundation), i. e. the place of Agni.' Saya _n_ a.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. IX, 75, 3. abhi im _ri_ tasya dohana _h_ anushata, and VIII, 12,\n32. na\xc2\xb4bha ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya dohana pra adhvare. I take dohana _h_ as acc. plur.\nof an abstract noun dohana formed like _g_ ara _n_ a, bhandana, &c. But\npossibly it might be the nom. plur. either of the same noun or of a nomen\nagentis dohana: 'the streams of _Ri_ ta (the libations?) or the milkers of\n_Ri_ ta, hidden at the birthplace of the god, have greeted him with shouts.'\nIt would\n\np. 162\n\nbe difficult, however, to say why the milkers of _Ri_ ta (i. e. the priests?)\nare called 'hidden at the birthplace of the god.' Prof. Max Muller thinks of a\nreading pariv _r i_ta _h_ , 'surrounding Agni.' He refers the 'streams of _Ri_\nta' (nom.) to the water, cf. I, 105, 12. _ri_ tam arshanti sindhava _h_.\n\nNote 2. Svadha\xc2\xb4 _h_ adhayat ya\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ i\xc2\xb4yate. In my opinion svadha\xc2\xb4 means\n'the inherent power,' 'the power of moving according to one's own will,' and\nthen the drink which confers this power on a being, especially on the dead\nancestors.--Comp. M. M., vol. xxxii, p. 32 seq.; H. O., Religion des Veda,\n531, note 2.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. According to Saya _n_ a the two beings spoken of here and in the next\nverse are the Hot _ri_ and the Adhvaryu.\n\nNote 2. See I, 130, 5. ayu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ata samanam artham akshitam; III, 6i, 3.\nsamanam artham _k_ ara _n_ iyamana.\n\nNote 3. On bhaga _h_ ni havya _h_ , see Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 121.\n\nNote 4. The charioteer is Agni.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. See verse 3, note 1.\n\nNote 2. Comp. Gaedicke, Der Accusativ, p. 175. He translates: 'bei Tage noch\nbei Nacht ergrauend.'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Vri _s_ (\xe1\xbc\x85\xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xce\xbe \xce\xbb\xce\xb5\xce\xb3\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbd) is ranged in the Nigha _n_ _t_ us among the\na\xe1\xb9\x85gulinamani and explained by Saya _n_ a accordingly. The word seems indeed to\nmean 'finger.' Compare with our passage IX, 8, 4; 15, 8; 93, 1; 97, 57.\n\nNote 2. Comp. I, 33, 4. dhano _h_ adhi vishu _n_ ak te vi ayan, and especially\nX, 4, 3. dhano _h_ adhi pravata yasi haryan. I cannot follow Pischel (Vedische\nStudien, II, 69 seq.) in explaining these passages. 'Over the heavenly expanse\nhe hastens down towards us.' M. M.\n\np. 163\n\nNote 3. See Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 300. Like Pischel I do not know who\n'they who approached Agni' are. Possibly the worshippers or priests are\nalluded to. 'He received new praises with (or from) those who approached him.'\nM. M.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Saya _n_ a explains the two female beings here in question as Heaven\nand Earth. Does the 'crooked movement' refer to the daily revolution of the\nsky?\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. The last Pada recurs X, 64, 11.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 145](sbe46043.htm)\n\n"
