What could we say to Rudra, the wise, the most liberal, the most powerful,\nthat is most welcome to his heart,--\n\n2\\. So that Aditi [1](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:2:1) may bring Rudra's healing to\nthe cattle, to men, to cow, and kith,\n\n3\\. So that Mitra, that Varu _n_ a, that Rudra hear us, and all the united\nMaruts [1](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:3:1).\n\n4\\. We implore Rudra, the lord of songs, the lord of animal sacrifices\n[1](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:4:1), the possessor of healing medicines\n[2](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:4:2), for health, wealth [3](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:4:3),\nand his favour.\n\n5\\. He who shines like the bright sun, and like gold, who is the best Vasu\namong the gods,\n\n6\\. May he bring health to our horse, welfare to ram and ewe, to men, to\nwomen, and to the cow!\n\n7\\. Bestow on us, O Soma, the happiness of a hundred men, great glory of\nstrong manhood [1](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:7:1);\n\n8\\. O Soma [1](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:8:1), let not those who harass and injure\noverthrow us; O Indu, help us to booty!\n\n9\\. Whatever beings are thine, the immortal, in the highest place of the law,\non its summit [1](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:9:1), in its centre, O Soma, cherish\nthem, remember them who honour thee.\n\np. 420\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Ka _n_ va Ghaura, and addressed to Rudra (I, 2, 4-6), to Rudra and\nMitra-Varu _n_ au (3), and to Soma (7-9). Metre, Gayatri (1-8); Anush _t_ ubh\n(9). Verse 2 in TS. III, 4, 11, 2; MS. IV, 12, 6.\n\nThe hymn may be divided into two, the first from 1-6, the second from 7-9.\nSee, however, Bergaigne, III, 32, n. 1; and Recherches sur l'hist. de la Sa\n_m_ hita, I, 65. He would prefer to divide the whole into three hymns.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nSee T\xc3\x82. X, 17, I; Delbruck, Synt. Forsch. I, 246.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Ludwig takes Aditi here as a name of Rudra; also Hillebrandt, \xc3\x9cber die\nGottin Aditi, p. 6.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The vi _s_ ve sa _g_ oshasa _h_ , following on Rudra, can hardly be\nmeant for any but the Maruts, who are often called sa _g_ oshasa _h_. But it\nmay also have been intended for all the gods together.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Gathapatim and medhapatim are both difficult. We expect gatha\xc2\xb4patim\nand medha\xc2\xb4patim. If, as Ludwig maintains, gatha in Zend is equivalent to _ri_\ntu, season, then gathapati might be _ri_ tupati, a name of Agni, X, 2, 1. But\nthis is extremely doubtful. We must derive gathapati from gatha\xcc\x86, I, 167, 6,\nand medhapati from medha\xcc\x86, animal sacrifice, till we know more on the subject.\n\nNote 2. _G_ alasha-bhesha _g_ am, an epithet of Rudra; see VIII, 29, 5, where\nRudra is intended. In II, 33, 7, the arm of Rudra is called bhesha _g_ a _h_\ngalasha _h_ ; in VII, 35, 6, Rudra himself is called _g_ alasha _h_. _G_\nalasha seems connected with _g_ ala, water. Bergaigne, III, 32, translates it\nby adoucissant.\n\nNote 3. On _s_ a _m_ yo _h_ , see note 2 to I, 165, 4.\n\np. 421\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Tuvi-n _ri_ m _n_ a would seem more appropriate as a vocative. In\nverse 8, too, I should prefer to take Soma as a vocative, like Benfey and\nGrassmann.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. I read Soma, pariba\xc2\xb4dha _h_. See Delbruck, Synt. Forsch. p. 116.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Unless we can take murdha\xc2\xb4 for a locative, attracted by na\xc2\xb4bha, I\nshould propose to read murdhan na\xc2\xb4bha. It can hardly be an adverbial Dvandva,\nmurdha-nabha, nor do I see how it can be applied as a nominative to Rudra. The\nwhole verse is difficult, possibly a later addition. On _ri_ tasya am _r\ni_tasya dha\xc2\xb4man, see IX, 97, 32; 110, 4 (dharman).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 114. To Rudra](sbe3256.htm)\n\n"
