An Indian prince in more\nmodern times appears to have diverted himself in a similar way.\n\nIt is still reported in Belgium that Appay Deasy was wont to amuse himself "by\nmaking several young and beautiful women stand side by side on a narrow\nbalcony, without a parapet, overhanging the deep reservoir at the new palace\nin Nipani. He used then to pass along the line of trembling creatures, and\nsuddenly thrusting one of them headlong into the water below, he used to watch\nher drowning, and derive pleasure from her dying agonies."--History of the\nBelgium District.
