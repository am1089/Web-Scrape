Or that (viz. the concealment of the soul's powers springs) from its\nconnexion with the body.\n\nBut if the soul is a part of the highest Self, why should its knowledge and\nlordship be hidden? We should rather\n\np. 140\n\nexpect them to be as manifest as the light and the heat of the spark.--True,\nwe reply; but the state of concealment of the soul's knowledge and lordship is\ndue to its being joined to a body, i.e. to a body, sense-organs, mind, buddhi,\nsense-objects, sensations, &c. And to this state of things there applies the\nsimile: As the heat and light of the fire are hidden as long as the fire is\nstill hidden in the wood from which it will be produced by friction, or as\nlong as it is covered by ashes; so, in consequence of the soul being connected\nwith limiting adjuncts in the form of a body, &c., founded on name and form as\npresented by Nescience, its knowledge and lordship remain hidden as long as it\nis possessed by the erroneous notion of not being distinct from those\nadjuncts.--The word 'or' in the Sutra is meant to discard the suspicion that\nthe Lord and the soul might be separate entities.--But why should not the soul\nbe separate from the Lord, considering the state of concealment of its\nknowledge and power? If we allow the two to be fundamentally separate, we need\nnot assume that their separateness is due to the soul's connexion with the\nbody.--It is impossible, we reply, to assume the soul to be separate from the\nLord. For in the scriptural passage beginning with 'That divinity thought' &c.\n( _Kh_. Up. VI, 3, 2) we meet with the clause, 'It entered into those beings\nwith this living Self ( _g_ iva atman); where the individual soul is referred\nto as the Self. And then we have the other passage, 'It is the True; it is the\nSelf; that art thou, O _S_ vetaketu,' which again teaches that the Lord is the\nSelf of the soul. Hence the soul is non-different from the Lord, but its\nknowledge and power are obscured by its connexion with the body. From this it\nfollows that the dreaming soul is not able to create, from its mere wishes,\nchariots and other things. If the soul possessed that power, nobody would ever\nhave an unpleasant dream; for nobody ever wishes for something unpleasant to\nhimself.--We finally deny that the scriptural passage about the waking state\n('dream is the same as the place of waking' &c.) indicates the reality of\ndreams. The statement made there about the equality of the two states\n\np. 141\n\nis not meant to indicate that dreams are real, for that would conflict with\nthe soul's self-luminousness (referred to above), and scripture, moreover,\nexpressly declares that the chariots, &c., of a dream have no real existence;\nit merely means that dreams, because due to mental impressions (vasana)\nreceived in the waking state, are equal to the latter in appearance.--From all\nthis it follows that dreams are mere illusion.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 7](sbe38110.htm)\n\n"
