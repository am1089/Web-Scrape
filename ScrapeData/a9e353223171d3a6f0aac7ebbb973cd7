And to that very (subtle body) (there belongs) the warmth, this only\nbeing reasonable.\n\nIt is observed that when a man is about to die there is some warmth left in\nsome part or parts of the gross body. Now this warmth cannot really belong to\nthe gross body, for it is not observed in other parts of that body (while yet\nthere is no reason why it should be limited to some part); but it may\nreasonably be attributed to the subtle body which may abide in some part of\nthe gross body (and into which the warmth of the entire gross body has\nwithdrawn itself). We therefore conclude that this partial perception of\nwarmth is due to the departing subtle body. This confirms the view laid down\nin Sutra 7.--The next Sutra disposes of a further doubt raised as to the\ndeparture of the soul of him who knows.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 12. ...
