But it is a meditation only, on account of assertion and what is seen.\n\nThe altars built of mind, and so on, are not of the nature of action, but of\nmeditation only, i.e. they belong to a performance which is of the nature of\nmeditation only. For this is what the text asserts, viz. in the clauses 'they\nare built of knowledge only,' and 'by knowledge they are built for him who\nthus knows.' As the energies of mind, speech, sight, and so on, cannot be\npiled up like bricks, it is indeed a matter of course that the so-called\naltars constructed of mind, and so on, can be mental constructions only; but\nthe text in addition specially confirms this by declaring that those altars\nare elements in an activity of purely intellectual character, and hence\nthemselves mere creatures of the intellect. Moreover there is seen in the text\na performance consisting of thought only to which those fires stand in a\nsubsidiary relation, 'by the mind they were established on hearths, by the\nmind they were built up, by the mind the Soma cups were drawn thereat;\n\np. 670\n\nby the mind they chanted, and by the mind they recited; whatever rite is\nperformed at the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that, as\nconsisting of mind, was performed by the mind only, on those (fire-altars)\ncomposed of mind, built up of mind.' From this declaration, that whatever\nsacrificial rite is actually performed in the case of fire-altars built of\nbricks is performed mentally only in the case of altars built of mind, it\nfollows that the entire performance is a mental one only, i.e. an act of\nmeditation.--But, an objection is raised, as the entire passus regarding the\naltars of mind does not contain any word of injunctive power, and as the text\nstates no special result (from which it appears to follow that the passus does\nnot enjoin a new independent performance), we must, on the strength of the\nfact that the leading subject-matter is an actual sacrificial performance as\nsuggested by the altars built of brick, give up the idea that the altars built\nof mind, &c., are mental only because connected with a performance of merely\nmental nature.--This objection the next Sutra refutes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 47.
