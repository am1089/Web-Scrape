He who knows himself as the fivefold hymn (uktha), the emblem of Pra _n_ a\n(breath), from whence all this springs 2, he is clever. These five are the\nearth, air, ether, water, and fire ( _g_ yotis). This is the self, the\nfivefold uktha. For from him all this springs, and into him it enters again\n(at the dissolution of the world). He who knows this, becomes the refuge of\nhis friends.\n\n2\\. And to him who knows the food (object) and the feeder (subject) in that\nuktha, a strong son is born, and food is never wanting. Water and earth are\nfood, for all food consists of these two. Fire and air are the feeder, for by\nmeans of them 3 man eats all food. Ether is the bowl, for all this is poured\ninto the ether. He who knows this, becomes the bowl or support of his friends.\n\n3\\. To him who knows the food and the feeder in that uktha, a strong son is\nborn, and food is never wanting. Herbs and trees are food, animals the feeder,\nfor animals eat herbs and trees.\n\n4\\. Of them again those who have teeth above\n\np. 222\n\nand below, shaped after the likeness of man, are feeders, the other animals\nare food. Therefore these overcome the other animals, for the eater is over\nthe food.\n\n5\\. He who knows this is over his friends.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[221:1](sbe01214.htm#fr_550) In this adhyaya some more qualities are explained\nbelonging to the Mahavrata ceremonial and the hymns employed at it, which can\nbe meditated on as referring to Pra _n_ a, life.\n\n[221:2](sbe01214.htm#fr_551) Because the world is the result or reward for\nperforming a meditation on the uktha.
