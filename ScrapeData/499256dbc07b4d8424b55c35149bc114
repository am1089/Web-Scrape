There is a camel-\ntrack that crosses the desert from Egypt into "Sooria," broken at the Suez\nCanal by a ferry. What road in Europe, Roman or barbarian, can compare in\ncharm and pathos with this sandy path? On it we might yet see a woman carrying\na child on the back of an ass, and an old man leading them, even as the\nlegends picture the Flight of the Holy Family. By it long ago marched the\narmies of Egypt to meet those of Assyria in destructive conflict on the\nborders of Israel. By it Judea sent the streams of her burning thought and\nfierce ethical emotion to Alexandria, before Christianity was born.\n\nSimilarly, all over India, away from her ancient high roads, and thrown like a\nnetwork across her proudest Himalayas, are little thread-like paths like this\n--ways made indeed by the feet of men, but worn far deeper by the weight of\nimpelling ideas than by the footprints of the toil-stained crowds.\n\nSuch roads must once have connected China with Kashmir. Afghanistan, always a\nprovince of India, must by just such paths have sent its wandering merchants\nwith nuts and raisins to the South, as long ago as the days of Solomon. Even\nnow it is by ways unpaved, deep-trodden, that the long-haired\n\np. 238\n\ngoats scramble down with their loads through the snowy defiles from Bokhara\nand Thibet, to be sheared in the sunny valley of the Jhelum, and furnish wool\nfor its famous shawls. Which comes first, we wonder, commerce or pilgrimage,\nthe trade route or the palmer\'s path? Would it not appear that the utilities\nof exchange draw men from their homes to points organically related, and does\nit not seem reasonable to believe that associations of beauty, arising\nspontaneously at place after place on the line of march, give birth to the\nnotion of religious privilege and obligation in making a return to particular\nspots?\n\nAt any rate, it is certain that behind sanctity of pilgrimage lies admiration\nof place, of art, even of geographical significance. Benares in the North, and\nConjeeveram * in the South, are loved and visited in India for the same reason\nas Durham or Cologne amongst ourselves. They are cathedral cities, rich in\narchitecture, in treasure, and in the associations of saints and scholars.\nJagannath \xe2\x80\xa0 is placed where it is, for sheer beauty of the sea, and perhaps a\nlittle also for the old cosmopolitan grandeur of the port through which flowed\nthe Eastern trade. Allahabad is sacred, because there two mighty rivers join\ntheir waters, making her the strategic key to two vast basins, inhabited by\ndifferent races, with diverse traditions, hopes, and folk-lore. It is the\nsolemn beauty of the Himalayas that makes them the refuge\n\np. 239\n\nof holy men. The four most meritorious pilgrimages * of the Hindus are the\nfour extreme points of India--North, South, East, and West--knowing which the\ncountry must be known. The worship of the Ganges, and the reverence that makes\na Dekkan villager journey, as an act of piety, to look on the face of one who\nhas seen any of the seven sacred rivers, amongst peoples less poetic, would be\nsimply called the love of place. How large an element in Hinduism is the folk-\nlore of the country! To the student who is looking for this, it appears to be\npast all computing. The Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and the Puranas are to a\ngreat extent the outpouring of passionate fancy in local interpretation. In\nthe story of Sati, the perfect wife, who can miss the significance of the\nfifty-two places in which fragments of the smitten body fell? "And one finger\nfell in Calcutta, and that is still the Kalighat. . . . And the tongue fell at\nKangra (Jowalla Mukhi) in the North Punjaub, and appears to this day as\nlicking tongues of fire, from underneath the ground. . . . And the left hand\nfell at Benares, which is for ever Onnopurna, the Giver of Bread." No\nforeigner can understand the crowding of associations into these few\nsentences.\n\nEven the Pole Star has its Indian myth in the legend of the child Dhruwa,\nwhose heart was the steadiest point in all the universe.\n\nNor is the historic element lacking, in this unconscious worship of country.\nLike that of some Indian Bernadette is the story told at a beautiful Southern\ntemple of a cowherd who had one cow that gave no milk. He followed her into\nthe jungle, and found a natural lingam in the rock, over which she poured her\noffering freely, of her own devotion.\n\np. 240\n\n[paragraph continues] And, in proof of the occurrence, does the temple altar\nnot consist to-day of that same lingam set in rough living rock? Of such\nstories the villages are full. Assuredly, a deep and conscious love of place\npervades the whole of the Indian scheme. It has never been called patriotism,\nonly because it has never been defined by boundaries of contrast; but the\nhome, the village, the soil, and, in a larger sense, the rivers, the\nmountains, and the country as a whole, are the objects of an almost passionate\nadoration. And nowhere are we more impressed by the completeness of Eastern\nidealism, than in this, its relating of itself to Nature. Norway, with her\nbroken crags and azure seas and sombre pines, her glacier-crowned mountains,\nand her island-dotted fjords, is surely beautiful. But Norway\'s memories are\nalways of the heroes, and we miss those voices of the saints that greet us at\nevery turn in every part of India. Brittany, windy and grey, storm-tost and\nboulder-strewn, is beautiful. Here. too the miles are marked with rude\n_Calvaires_ , and the tales of the saints lie like her own moorland mists\nacross the whole Breton land. But this Catholic sainthood never reaches the\nstern intellectual discipline of Hinduism, and we long in vain for that\nmingling of mystic passion and philosophic freedom, where holiness merges into\nscholarship, that at once distinguishes the Orient, and weds its races and all\ntheir dreams to their own soil. It might almost have been S. Francis, but it\nis actually a Bengali poem of the people, that says:\n\nOh, Mother Earth, Father Sky,  \nBrother Wind, Friend Light,  \nSweetheart Water,  \nHere take my last salutation with folded hands!  \nFor to-day I am melting away into the Supreme,  \nBecause my heart became pure, And all delusion vanished,  \nThrough the power of your good company:\n\np. 241\n\nBeauty of place translates itself to the Indian consciousness as God\'s cry to\nthe soul. Had Niagara been situated on the Ganges, it is odd to think how\ndifferent would have been its valuation by humanity. instead of fashionable\npicnics and railway pleasure-trips, the yearly or monthly incursion of\nworshipping crowds. Instead of hotels, temples. Instead of ostentatious\nexcess, austerity. Instead of the desire to harness its mighty forces to the\nchariot of human utility, the unrestrainable longing to throw away the body,\nand realise at once the ecstatic madness of Supreme Union. Could contrast be\ngreater?\n\nIt is commonly said that Hindus derive the idea of pilgrimage from the\nBuddhist worship of relics. But the psychological aspects of the custom make\nthis appear unlikely. Doubtless the great commercial nexus of the Buddhist\nperiod made transport easy, and thus strengthened and stimulated the tendency,\njust as railways have in modern times opened up the country, and created the\npossibility of a geographical sense amongst classes who in older days could\nnot have aspired to travel far or often. But in its essence, the institution\nis so entirely an expression of love for the Motherland, that it must have\nbeen anterior to Buddhism by at least as much as the Aryan occupation of\nIndia. If one visits the Kennery caves, hidden amongst the jungles to the\nnorth of Bombay, this fact is brought home to one. Here are a hundred and\neight cells, cut out of the solid rock. They are grouped in pairs; each pair\nhas its own water-supply; and, wherever the view is finest, wherever a glimpse\ncan be caught of the meeting-line of sea and forest, there a staircase and\nseat will be found specially carved in the stone, for purposes of\ncontemplation. For Nature is the eternal fact, and the landscape from this\npoint a thousand years ago was as beautiful as it is to-day.\n\np. 242\n\nEllora shows at a glance that through century after century it has been a holy\nplace. The Buddhist found it already so, and in due time the Mussulman\nconfirmed the ancient choice, by bringing his illustrious dead to lie in the\nmighty fane on its hilltop. But why was it first selected? None who has\nwakened to the dewy freshness of its morning, none who has gazed thence across\nthe sea-like plain, can ask. To all eternity, while the earth remains what she\nis, Ellora will be one of the spots where the mystery of God is borne in, in\noverwhelming measure, upon the souls of men, whatever their associations,\nwhatever their creed.\n\nBut we are dominated more by the idea that is behind us than by the\nspontaneous impressions of our senses. To the nomad of the desert, accustomed\nto the shifting of hot sands, and ceaseless moving of the camp, with what\ncoolness and refreshment must rise the thought of death! Mussulman piety has\nthree motives--the glory of man, the charm of woman, and the holiness of the\ngrave. In very early times we see the august pastor Abraham seeking out a cave\nin which to place the body of his wife. Death, the fixed, the still, the cold,\nmust be shrined within the steady and imperishable. "The long home," a great\nrock in a weary land, endless rest, eternal cold and silence, all these are to\nbe found in the grave. Is it not easy to understand that while the peasant,\nfrom the banks of the Ganges to the banks of the Tiber, turns naturally to\nburning of the dead, the wilderness-dwellers bury him deep in mother earth, or\nbuild him about with unyielding granite, and thenceforth make this dwelling-\nhouse of the beloved as the centre of their own wanderings?\n\nHence, what the sacred place of pilgrimage is to the Hindu, that the Taj Mahal\nor the tomb of Aurungzeeb, or the ever-memorable grave at Medina, is to the\npious Mussulman. Almost every Mohammedan\n\np. 243\n\nvillage in India, too, has its sleeping-place of some "pir" or saint; and I\nhave seen a poverty-stricken God\'s acre, where the sole treasure of the people\nwas a gnarled and scarcely-living stump, that marked the last home of a long-\nremembered holy man. For it is the ideal of the desert--rest from their\nwanderings and shadow from its scorching sun--it is this ideal, and not the\nnatural dictation of their own birth-place, that has become the guiding-power\nbehind the life and choice of these Moslemised Indian folk. And yet all their\nold poetry of soil comes out in the spot they choose! The tomb in the village-\ngrove; the Taj at the river-bend; the iris-covered graves on the riversides\nand hillocks of Kashmir; what pictures do these make at dawn and sunset, or\nthrough the long Indian night, with its mysterious voices sighing and\nwhispering about the dead! Surely, by thus adding the pastoral tradition to\nher own, India grows rich, not poor, in the things that form the true wealth\nof men.\n\nA pilgrim\'s camp is like some scene taken out of the Middle Ages, Or, rather,\nit would be like it, but that is so largely depleted of militant elements. The\nNagas, or armed friars, are no menace to anything in the modern system, which\nindeed at this moment they do not understand; and the authority that actually\nprotects and keeps order amongst the pilgrims is to be sought rather in the\nunarmed district officer, or _tehsildar_ , than in anything that could be\nrecognised as forceful by the naked eye. In the South, which is the home of\northodoxy, pilgrimage has gone out of fashion since the advent of railways.\nFewer people, certainly fewer widows, visit Benares, since it became easier to\ndo so. And those who have seen a genuine crowd of shrine-farers, in some place\nremote from steam, cannot wonder at the shock which the pious imagination\nsuffers at the sight of a locomotive. Amongst other\n\np. 244\n\nthings that the religious traveller has a right to expect is the opportunity\nof a flight from the New India to the Old, as an actual environment. From any\npoint where many ways meet, and various streams of pilgrims converge upon each\nother, the road to the sacred place will be divided into regular stages of a\nday\'s journey, and at each halting-place a camp will be pitched for the night.\nEven these rest-camps will be situated as far as possible at spots peculiar\nfor their beauty or interest. Is there a cluster of springs? The place is said\nto be "holy," and we must halt there for worship. Originally, this referred\nonly to beauty and convenience; but in process of time one cannot doubt that a\ncertain atmosphere of insight and devotion has really thrown its halo about\nthe dust and water of the locality, and in the place where so much simple\nfaith has spent its rapture, the highest love and prayer have become easier to\nall corners.\n\nBut the temples are all visited, the bathing is performed, evening worship is\nover, and silence and sleep fall upon the pilgrims\' camp. The moon grows to\nthe full, for we must arrive at the goal on the fifteenth day. And again, it\nis the simple beauty of the world which determines the law, that under the\nyoung moon shall be the going forth, and with her wane the return home. The\nmoon is near the full, and weariness sleeps sound. At what hour is the first\ntent struck? When does the first sleeper rouse himself, and take again to the\nroad? Who can tell? Certainly not one who has never been able to rise so long\nbefore dawn that others were not up and afoot before her, their tents gone,\nand little heaps of white ashes from the cooking-fires the only sign of their\ntwelve hours\' tenancy of tree-shadow or stream-side.\n\nOn go the pilgrims, singly or in groups. Old women, bent double with age and\ntoil, hobbling along\n\np. 245\n\nby the help of the pointed alpenstock: Monks of all descriptions are to be\nseen. Some of them are covered with ashes, have long reddish-looking hair,\nwear only the yellow loin-cloth, and carry curious tongs and begging-bowls.\nThese may be Yogis, of the order that believes in the mortification of the\nflesh; or Nagas, the militant monks, who were once ready to defend the Faith\nat any moment, and who to this day are powerfully organised to meet the shock\nof a world that has long ago, alas, passed away like a dream. The _sannyasin_\n, often a man of modern education, decently clad in the sacred salmon-yellow,\naccepting no alms save food, refusing the touch of any metal, is here, doing\nthe distance cheerfully on foot. Next comes an ascetic, with withered arm held\naloft and useless this many a long year. Again, a proud _mahunt_ , abbot of\nsome rich foundation, master of elephants and treasure uncounted, is borne\npast. Or, as one climbs, having abandoned the open dandy that costs such\nintolerable labour to the bearers on a mountain march, one may be joined in\nkindly chat by some one or two of the "Naked Swamis"--men who wear neither\nashes nor clothing beyond the necessary scanty rag, who wander amongst sunny\ndeserts and snowy mountains alike indifferent to heat and cold, and of whom,\nwhen one talks with them, one remembers nothing, save that here are friends of\nthe culture of scholars, and the breeding and rank of gentlemen.\n\nBut the crowd is still more motley. In camp, the strips of yellow cloth that\nso often do duty as a shelter for the religious, stand side by side with tents\nof all sizes and conditions. And here now are zenana-ladies carried in\nscarlet-covered palkees; other women, again, on horseback; men and women alike\non foot, or in open dandies; householders, widows, sannyasinis in beads and\nyellow cloth; there are even some, too weak for walking or climbing,\n\np. 246\n\nwho are borne in straw chairs, strapped to the back of a man carrying a stout\nstaff. On and on presses the irregular host, mixed up with Mohammedan baggage-\ncarriers and servants, cooks, and food-vendors of all sorts.\n\nHere the road is broken by a glacier. There it becomes a mere goat-path,\nrunning across dangerous crags. Here is the lake into which an avalanche,\nbrought down by their hymn of triumph, once precipitated thousands of\nreturning pilgrims. Now we have reached the heights where the ground is\ncarpeted with edelweiss instead of grass. Again, we are wandering amidst\nwildernesses of flowers, while every few yards the dominant note in the\ncomposition is changed imperceptibly: first the yellow wallflower, then flame-\ncoloured Iceland poppies, again the long-stalked single-headed Michaelmas\ndaisy of the Himalayas. When the journey began, almost the only blossoms were\nthe orchids on the tree-trunks in the region of maidenhair fern. Now we have\npassed the last of the pine woods. Even the white birches, like smitten silver\nveining blown sharp and twisted against the mountain sides, are gone: and to-\nnight, when the tents are pitched over purple and white anemones, there will\nbe no fuel save the juniper scrub that clings to the face of the rock in\nsheltered niches. On the edge of the last glacier, growing beside the gentian,\nwe find an evergreen forget-me-not, unknown to us hitherto, and making the\nthird or fourth new species--from a large crimson and purple myosotis onwards\n--which our pilgrimage has bestowed.\n\nOur neighbours in the tents about us are not amusing themselves by botanising,\nprobably, but they are communing with Nature none the less truly than\nourselves. On the last day, drawing gear to the shrine, we shall see them risk\ntheir lives to gather the great nodding columbines and the\n\np. 247\n\nlittle Alpine roses growing on the rocks. Their talk is all of Siva. As they\nare borne along, they are striving, doubtless, to fix their minds on the\nrepetition of His name, or the contemplation of His form. But the awesome\ngrandeur and beauty of the heights about them will always be remembered by\nthem as the Great God\'s fit dwelling-place. They are in a church. Rocks and\nglaciers form the sanctuary. Snowy passes are the pillared aisles. Behind them\nstand the pine-forests for processions of singers carrying banners, and\noverhead are the heavens themselves for cathedral roof. It is the peculiarity\nof Eastern peoples to throw upon the whole of Nature that feeling which we\nassociate only with the place of worship. But is their love less real, or\ngreater, for this fact?\n\nThe day of the full moon comes, the last and most dangerous points are\nsurmounted, and the Shrine is reached. Happy the man or woman, who, on this\njourney to God, is snatched out of life! One false step, and the soul that was\nstruggling to see may be carried up at once in a swift sure flight. Or death\nmay come in other ways. "It is so beautiful! I must be one with it!" sighed a\nman who stood on a precipice, looking down at the valleys. And before any one\ncould stop him, he was gone. Such things are not premeditated. There is a\ngenuine ecstasy of the soul in which it hears the voice of the Eternities\ncalling to it, and the prisoning body becomes suddenly intolerable. Is it a\nstain upon Hinduism that it has never called this "suicide while of unsound\nmind"?\n\nBut the Shrine itself--where is it? what is it? Perhaps a temple, placed above\nsome gorge, on a beetling rock, with sister snows in sight. Perhaps the source\nof a sacred river. Perhaps a cave, in which continual dripping of water makes\na stalagmite of ice, a huge crystalline lingam that never melts.\n\np. 248\n\n[paragraph continues] One can picture how such a place would first be\ndiscovered. Some party of shepherds, losing themselves and their flocks\namongst the ravines on a summer day, and entering the cavern by accident, to\nfind there the presence of the Lord Himself. Men and beasts, awed and\nworshipping, how dear is such a picture to the Christian heart!\n\nWorship! Worship! The very air is rent with prayer and hymns. From the Unreal\nto the Real! From the Many to the One! Lord of Animals! Refuge of Weariness!\nSiva! Siva! the Free! the Free!\n\nHours pass, and ere dawn next day the descent to the valleys is begun.\nWonderful is the snowy stillness of the lofty pass, when, with our faces set\nhomewards, the moon fades behind us, and the sun rises before. The pilgrims\nmarch with less regularity now. All are anxious to return, and some push on,\nwhile others break off from the line of route. We reach our own village, and\nsay farewell to the acquaintances of the pilgrimage, adding what comfort we\nmay to the provision for their further journeying. The nights grow dark now,\nand the great experience becomes a memory, marked always, however, in the\nHindu\'s life, by some special abstinence, practised henceforth as the\npilgrim\'s thank-offering.\n\nIt is easy to believe that the scenes in which we have mingled are nowadays\ndenuded of half their rightful elements; that once upon a time as many of the\ntravellers would have been Tartar or Chinese as Indian; that the shrine\nrepresents what may have been the summer meeting of great trading caravans;\nthat Nagarjuna and Bodhidharmma, going out to the Further East with their\ntreasures of Indian thought, were in the first place pilgrims on some such\npilgrimage as this. Even now, many of the functions of a university are served\nby the great\n\np. 249\n\ngathering. Hundreds, or even thousands, of religious men meet, in a manner to\neliminate personal ties of friendship and affection, and emphasise and refresh\nthe ideal and intellectual aspects of their lives.\n\nAt the vast assemblies of _sadhus_ , which occur once in every twelve years at\nHurdwar, at Nasick, at Ujjain, and at Allahabad, there are fixed halls of\nlearned disputation, where, for hundreds of years, Hindu philosophy has been\ndiscussed, determined, and expanded, something in the fashion of the Welsh\nEisteddfod. Here come the wandering monks from every part of India. Here the\nhouseholder finds himself in vigorous and renewed relation to his faith. Here\nfresh voices of learning and devotion are able to win for themselves\necclesiastical authority. Such opportunities must have been the means by which\nSankaracharya asserted his undisputed mastery of the world of Hindu\nscholarship. Did it, we wonder, occur to Alexander that learned Greeks might\nbe sent to such wandering colleges in order to hear and to tell new things?\n\nSanskrit is the _lingua franca_ of this ancient learning. To this day the\nvisitor to a Calcutta _toll_  * may hear the boys dispute with each other on\ntimeworn themes in the classic tongue, and may picture himself back in the\ncolleges of Thebes or Athens in the long ago. But here in the great _melas_\nare the crowning achievements towards which are directed the hardier ambitions\nof those Brahman boys. And we need not wonder at their enthusiasm for such\ndistinction. The great open competition, with its\n\np. 250\n\nthousands of years of the prestige of learning, is like all the learned\nsocieties of a European metropolis thrown into one. The canvas city of a few\nweeks at Nasick or Allahabad serves all the purposes of Burlington House to\nLondon. But the system of culture to which Nasick belongs is no longer\ngrowing, it will be said. This is, indeed, its defect. The statement is not\nentirely true, for even now the test of a supremely national personality would\nstill be, for the Hindu world, his power to add to their philosophy. But it is\ntrue to the extent that there is nothing left for collective thought to\ndiscover. The common mind of India has now to sweep great circles of\nintellectual exploration in worlds that as yet are virgin as the Polar ice, or\nIndia will die. Of this there can be no doubt.\n\nFar away from the noisy throng of learned saints, or taking a humble place in\nwhite cotton garb as visitors amongst them, are the men whose lives are passed\nin the libraries of kings. For the system of patronage is part and parcel of\nIndian scholarship, and as the Japanese _daimio_ or the Italian prince\nmaintained his artists and artificers, so, under the old _r egime_, did every\nIndian palace possess its staff of palace-pundits--men whose lives were made\nfree of anxiety in order that they might heap up knowledge and pore over\nancient texts.\n\nThe supreme privilege of the great is to foster piety and learning. But, on\nthe other hand, Manu does not fail to point out that there is no crime for the\nBrahman like the acceptance of gifts from one who is not the lawful king. And\nit is not royal persons alone who are charged with the duty of supporting\nscholars. Never a wedding or a requiem can take place amongst the higher ranks\nof society without the distribution of money to tolls and pundits. For it is\none of the postulates of ethical, and therefore of Eastern, economics,\n\np. 251\n\nthat all great accumulation is for subsequent great distribution.\n\nIt is a strange world that has been revealed to us in this camp of pilgrimage,\nand it is not easy to reach its full significance. Scarcely in any two tents\ndo they understand each other\'s language, and we shall do better to ask for\nbread in Sanskrit than in English. Malabaris and Bengalis, Sikhs and Madrasis,\nMahrattas and even Mussulmans, dwell side by side for the nonce. Could\nincongruity and disunion be more strongly illustrated?\n\nYet it was unity and not disunity that impressed us as we looked. From one end\nof the camp to the other the same simple way of life, the same sacramental\nreverence for food and bathing, the same gentleness and courtesy, the same\ntypes of face and character, and, above all, one great common scheme of\nthought and purpose.\n\nThe talk may be in different languages; but no matter at what tent door we\nmight become eavesdroppers, we should find its tone and subject much the same\n--always the lives of the saints, always the glory of the soul, always\nfidelity to _guru_ and _dharmma_. By two formulae, and two alone, renunciation\nand freedom from personality, is all life here interpreted.\n\nOther countries have produced art, chivalry, heroic poems, inventive systems\nIn none of these has India been altogether wanting, yet none is her\ndistinguishing characteristic. What, then, has she given to the world that is\nbeyond all competition? To-day her gifts are decried by all men, for to-day\nthe mighty mother is become widowed and abased. She who has held open port to\nall fugitives is unable now to give bread to her own children. She with whom\nParsi, Jew, and Christian have been thankful to take refuge, is despised and\nostracised by all three alike. She who has prized knowledge above all her\n\np. 252\n\ntreasures, finds her learning now without value in the markets of the world.\nIt is urged that the test of utility is the true standard for things\ntranscendental, and that an emancipation into modern commerce and mechanics is\na worthier goal for her sons\' striving than the old-time aim of knowledge for\nits own sake, the ideal for itself.\n\nAnd the modern world may be right.\n\nBut, even so, has India in the past given nothing, without which our whole\npresent would be the poorer?\n\nWho that has caught even a whisper of what her name means can say so? Custom\nkept always as an open door, through which the saints may dance into our\ncompany, thought sustained at a level where religion and science are one, a\nmaze of sublime apostrophes and world-piercing prayers; above all, the power\nto dream rare dreams of the Word becoming flesh and dwelling among men that\nthey may behold His glory--are these things nothing? If, after all the higher\ntransformation of man be the ultimate end of human effort, which has more\ndeeply vindicated its right to exist, the modern nexus of commerce and\nfinance, or that old world on which we have gazed in the pilgrims\' camp?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[238:*](wil17.htm#fr_38) Conjeeveram.--A town in the Madras Presidency, which\ncontains some of the most beautiful specimens of Dravidian architecture.
