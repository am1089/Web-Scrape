And as to why it is called Purushamedha:--The stronghold (pur)\ndoubtless is these worlds, and the Purusha (spirit) is he that blows here (the\nwind), he bides ( _s_ i) in this stronghold (pur): hence he is the Purusha.\nAnd whatever food there is in these worlds that is its 'medha,' its food; and\ninasmuch as this is its 'medha,' its food, therefore (it is called)\nPurushamedha. And inasmuch as at this (sacrifice) he seizes 1 men (purusha)\nmeet for sacrifice (medhya), therefore also it is called Purushamedha.\n\n13:6:2:22\\. He seizes them on the central day, for the central day is the air,\nand the air is the abode of all beings; and, indeed, these victims are also\nfood, and the central day is the belly: he thus puts food in the belly.\n\n13:6:2:33\\. He seizes them by decades 2 for the obtainment\n\np. 408\n\nof all food, for the Vira _g_ consists of ten syllables, and the Vira _g_ is\nall food 1.\n\n13:6:2:44\\. Eleven decades 2 he seizes;--the Trish _t_ ubh consists of eleven\nsyllables, and the Trish _t_ ubh is the thunderbolt, and vigour: with the\nthunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus repels evil from within him.\n\n13:6:2:55\\. Forty-eight he seizes at the central stake;--the _G_ agati\nconsists of forty-eight syllables, and cattle are of _G_ agata (movable)\nnature: by means of the _G_ agati he (the priest) secures cattle for him.\n\n13:6:2:66\\. Eleven at each of the others;--the Trish _t_ ubh consists of\neleven syllables, and the Trish _t_ ubh is the thunderbolt, and vigour: with\nthe thunderbolt,\n\np. 409\n\nwith vigour, the Sacrificer thus repels evil from about him.\n\n13:6:2:77\\. Last of all he seizes eight;--the Gayatri consists of eight\nsyllables, and the Gayatri is the Brahman (n.): he thus makes the Brahman to\nbe the ultimate thing of this universe, whence they say that the Brahman is\nthe ultimate thing of this universe.\n\n13:6:2:88\\. These (eight) are sacred to Pra _g_ apati, Pra _g_ apati assuredly\nis the Brahman, for Pra _g_ apati is of the nature of the Brahman 1: therefore\nthey are sacred to Pra _g_ apati.\n\n13:6:2:99\\. When about to bring up the victims, he offers those three\noblations to Savit _ri_ , with (Va _g_. S. XXX, 1-3), 'God Savit _ri_ , (speed\nthe sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice unto his share)!'--'May we obtain\nthat glorious light of the God Savit _ri_ , (who shall inspire our\nprayers)!'--'All troubles remove thou from us, O God Savit _ri_ : bestow unto\nus what is auspicious!' He thus pleases Savit _ri_ , and thus pleased with\nhim, he (Savit _ri_ ) impels (speeds) those (sacrificial) men, and he seizes\nthem impelled by that (Savit _ri_ ).\n\n13:6:2:1010\\. For the priesthood he seizes a Brahma _n_ a, for the Brahma _n_\na is the priesthood: he thus joins priesthood to priesthood 2;--for the\nnobility he seizes a Ra _g_ anya, for the Ra _g_ anya is the nobility: he thus\njoins nobility to nobility;--for the Maruts (he seizes) a Vai _s_ ya, for the\nMaruts are the clans (peasants): he thus joins peasantry to peasantry;--\n\np. 410\n\nfor (religious) toil (he seizes) a _S_ udra, for the _S_ udra is toil: he thus\njoins toil to toil;--according to their particular form he thus supplies these\ndivinities with victims, and, thus supplied, they supply him with all his\nobjects of desire.\n\n13:6:2:1111\\. He makes offering with ghee, for ghee is fiery mettle: by means\nof fiery mettle he thus endows him (the Sacrificer) with fiery mettle. He\nmakes offering with ghee, for that--to wit, ghee--is the dear resource of the\ngods: he thus supplies them with their dear resource, and, thus supplied, they\nsupply him with all his objects of desire.\n\n13:6:2:1212\\. By means of the Purusha Naraya _n_ a (litany), the Brahman\npriest (seated) to the right (south) of them, praises the men bound (to the\nstakes) with this sixteen-versed (hymn, _Ri_ g-v. X, 90, Va _g_. S. XXXI,\n1-16), 'The thousand-headed Purusha, thousand-eyed, thousand-footed 1 . . .;'\n--thus (he does) for the obtainment and the securing of everything, for\neverything here consists of sixteen parts, and the Purushamedha is everything:\nin thus saying, 'So and so thou art, so and so thou art,' he praises and\nthereby indeed magnifies him (Purusha); but he also thereby speaks of him,\nsuch as he is. Now, the victims had had the fire carried round them, but they\nwere not yet slaughtered,--\n\n13:6:2:1313\\. Then a voice 2 said to him, 'Purusha, do not\n\np. 411\n\nconsummate (these human victims 1): if thou wert to consummate them, man\n(purusha) would eat man.' Accordingly, as soon as fire had been carried round\nthem, he set them free, and offered oblations to the same divinities 2, and\nthereby gratified those divinities, and, thus gratified, they, gratified him\nwith all objects of desire.\n\n13:6:2:1414\\. He makes offering with ghee, for ghee is fiery mettle: with\nfiery mettle he thus bestows fiery mettle upon him.\n\n13:6:2:1515\\. He concludes with those of the set of eleven (stakes),--the\nTrish _t_ ubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trish _t_ ubh is the\nthunderbolt, and vigour: with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer\nthus repels evil from within.\n\n13:6:2:1616\\. The Udayaniya (concluding oblation) having been completed, he\nseizes eleven barren cows, sacred to Mitra-Varu _n_ a, the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_\n, and B _ri_ haspati 3, with the view of winning these deities. And as to\nthose of B _ri_ haspati being last,--B _ri_ haspati truly is the Brahman (n.),\nand thus he finally establishes himself in the Brahman.\n\np. 412\n\n13:6:2:1717\\. And as to why there are eleven of them,--the Trish _t_ ubh\nconsists of eleven syllables, and the Trish _t_ ubh is the thunderbolt, and\nvigour: with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus repels evil\nfrom within. The Traidhatavi is the final offering (Udavasaniya): the mystic\nimport is the same (as before 1).\n\n13:6:2:1818\\. Now as to the sacrificial fees. What there is towards the middle\nof the kingdom other than the land and the property of the Brahma _n_ a, but\nincluding the men, of that the eastern quarter belongs to the Hot _ri_ , the\nsouthern to the Brahman, the western to the Adhvaryu, and the northern to the\nUdgat _ri_ ; and the Hot _ri_ kas share this along with them.\n\n13:6:2:1919\\. And if a Brahma _n_ a performs the sacrifice, he should bestow\nall his property in order to obtain and secure everything, for the Brahma _n_\na is everything, and all one's property is everything, and the Purushamedha is\neverything.\n\n13:6:2:2020\\. And having taken up the two fires within his own self 2, and\nworshipped the sun with the Uttara-Naraya _n_ a (litany, viz. Va _g_. S. XXXI,\n17-22), let him betake himself to the forest without looking round; and that\n(place), indeed, is apart from men. But should he wish to live in the village,\nlet him take up again the two fires in the churning-sticks, and having\nworshipped the sun with the Uttara-Naraya _n_ a (litany) let him dwell at his\nhome, and let him offer such sacrifices as he may\n\np. 413\n\nbe able to afford. But, indeed, this (sacrifice) is not to be imparted to any\nand every one, lest one should impart everything to any and every one, for the\nPurushamedha is everything; but one may only impart it to one who is known to\nhim, and who is versed in sacred writ, and who may be dear to him, but not to\nany and every one.\n\n### THE (SYMBOLICAL) VICTIMS OF THE PURUSHAMEDHA 1.\n\nI. 1.

There the first eleven Ka _n_ _d_ ikas (5-15) are made up of the\nnames and deities of ten victims each, hence together of eleven decades;\nwhilst of the subsequent Ka _n_ _d_ ikas--k. 16 consists of twelve, ks. 17-22\nof ten each, and k. 22 of twelve victims. The actual mode of distribution over\nthe several stakes is that referred to in paragraphs 5-8, viz. the first\nforty-eight victims are tied to the central stake, after which eleven victims\nare tied to each of the other ten stakes. After these, amounting to 258\nvictims, the Sa _m_ hita p. 408 enumerates twenty-six additional victims,\nwhich, according to Mahidhara (cf. Katy. XXI, 1, so), are to be added to the\neleven victims of the second stake,--viz. fourteen victims dedicated to\nvarious so-called deities; eight victims, sacred to Pra _g_ apati and\nbelonging neither to the _S_ udra nor to the Brahma _n_ a castes; and finally\nfour more victims, characterised in exactly the same way as the eight\npreceding ones. It will be seen that of these twenty-six victims only the\nfirst set of (eight) Pra _g_ apatya victims are referred to in the Brahma _n_\na, and that as the victims seized last of all. This circumstance clearly\ncharacterises the last four victims of the Sa _m_ hita as not recognised by\nthe Brahma _n_ a; and seeing that all four of these are such as have already\noccurred amongst the previously enumerated victims (though there assigned to\ndifferent divinities) they must be considered (as they are by Prof. Weber,\nInd. Streifen, I, p. 68) as having been added to the list of the Sa _m_ hita\nsubsequently to the composition of the Brahma _n_ a. A similar inference will\nprobably apply to the fourteen victims preceding the eight Pra _g_ apatya\nones, though all that can be urged against them is that they are not referred\nto in the Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[408:1](sbe44111.htm#fr_1067) Hardly,--and all food is vira _g_ (widely ruling\nor shining). In double clauses with a middle term, such as this, the position\nof subject and predicate seems often reversed in the second clause (cf. for\ninstance, [XIII, 8, 1, 4](sbe44113.htm#13:8:1:4)),\n\n[408:2](sbe44111.htm#fr_1068) See note 2 on p. 407.\n\n[409:1](sbe44111.htm#fr_1069) That is, of the divine spirit, the world-soul,\nof which Pra _g_ apati is, as it were, the personification, or phenomenal\nrepresentative.\n\n[409:2](sbe44111.htm#fr_1070) Or, he perfects, completes, the priesthood by\n(adding to it a member of) the priesthood.\n\n[410:1](sbe44111.htm#fr_1071) For a complete translation of this hymn, the\nPurusha-sukta, see J. Muir, Orig. Sanskrit Texts, vol. i, p. 9 seqq. Cp. also\npart iv, introduction, p. xiv.\n\n[410:2](sbe44111.htm#fr_1072) 'A bodiless voice,' comm.; cf. XI, 4, 2, 16\nwhere likewise 'an invisible voice' is introduced censuring the priest who\nburns the oblations. Perhaps, however, Va _k_ may be intended from whom Pra\n_g_ apati, in the beginning, produced the waters; cf. VI, 1, 1, 9.\n\n[411:1](sbe44111.htm#fr_1073) Thus (i.e. do not go through with this human\nsacrifice) the commentator, probably correctly, interprets 'sa _m_ sthapaya'\n(instead of 'do not kill,' St. Petersb. Dict., though, practically, it would,\nof course, come to the same thing),--Purusha, etan purushapa _s_ un ma sa _m_\ntish _t_ ipa _h_ , uda\xe1\xb9\x85nayadikany a\xe1\xb9\x85gany esha _m_ ma k _ri_ tha ityartha _h_ ;\nyadi sa _m_ sthapayishyasi tata _h_ _s_ eshabhakshanukare _n_ a loke\xe0\xa4\xbdpi\npurusha _h_ purusham bhakshayishyati ta _k_ _k_ ayuktam ity abhipraya _h_.
