Having\nascended the car of Om with Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u (the Higher Self) as the charioteer, one\nwishing to go to the seat of Brahmaloka intent on the worship of Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra, should\ngo in the chariot so long as he can go. Then abandoning the car, he reaches\nthe place of the Lord of the car. Having given up m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81, li\xe1\xb9\x85ga, 2 and pa\xe1\xb8\x8da, 3\nhe attains the subtle pa\xe1\xb8\x8da (seat or word) without vowels or consonants by\nmeans of the letter M without the svara (accent). That is called pra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra\nwhen one merely thinks of the five objects of sense, such as sound, etc., as\nalso the very unsteady mind as the reins of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Pra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra (subjugation of\nthe senses), \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na (contemplation), pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma (control of breath), \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81\n(concentration), t\xc4\x81rka 4 and sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi are said to be the six parts of yoga.\nJust as the impurities of mountain-minerals are burnt by the blower, so the\nstains committed by the organs are burned by checking pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a. Through\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81mas should be burnt the stains; through \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81, the sins; through\npra\xe1\xb9\xady\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81ra,\n\np. 217\n\nthe (bad) associations; and through \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na, the godless qualities. Having\ndestroyed the sins, one should think of Ruchira (the shining). Ruchira\n(cessation), expiration and inspiration--these three are pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma of\n(rechaka, p\xc5\xabraka and kumbhaka) expiration, inspiration and cessation of\nbreath. That is called (one) pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81ma when one repeats with a prolonged (or\nelongated) breath three times the G\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\xab with its vy\xc4\x81h\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadis and Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava\n(before it) along with the \xc5\x9biras 1 (the head) joining after it. Raising up the\nv\xc4\x81yu from the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b (region, _viz_., the heart) and making the body void (of\nv\xc4\x81yu) and empty and uniting (the soul) to the state of void, is called rechaka\n(expiration). That is called p\xc5\xabraka (inspiration) when one takes in v\xc4\x81yu, as a\nman would take water into his mouth through the lotus-stalk. That is called\nkumbhaka (cessation of breath) when there is no expiration or inspiration and\nthe body is motionless, remaining still in one state. Then he sees forms like\nthe blind, hears sounds like the deaf and sees the body like wood. This is the\ncharacteristic of one that has attained much quiescence. That is called\n\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 when the wise man regards the mind as sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa and merging sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa\ninto \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, contemplates upon his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (alone). That is called t\xc4\x81rka when one\nmakes inference which does not conflict with the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. That is called sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi\nin which one, on attaining it, thinks (all) equal.\n\nSeating himself on the ground on a seat of ku\xc5\x9ba grass which is pleasant and\ndevoid of all evils, having protected himself mentally (from all evil\ninfluences), uttering ra\xe1\xb9\xadha-ma\xe1\xb9\x87dala, 2 assuming either pa\xe1\xb8\x8dma, svas\xe1\xb9\xadika, or\nbha\xe1\xb8\x8dra posture or any other which can be practised easily, facing the north\nand closing the nostril with the thumb, one should inspire through the other\nnostril and retain breath inside and preserve the Agni (fire). Then he should\nthink of the sound (Om) alone. Om, the one letter is Brahman; Om should not be\nbreathed out. Through this divine man\xe1\xb9\xadra (Om), it should be done many times to\nrid himself of\n\np. 218\n\nimpurity. Then as said before, the man\xe1\xb9\xadra-.knowing wise should regularly\nmeditate, beginning with the navel upwards in the gross, the primary (or less)\ngross and subtle (states). The greatly wise should give up all (sight) seeing\nacross, up or down, and should practise yoga always being motionless and\nwithout tremor. The union as stated (done) by remaining without tremor in the\nhollow stalk ( _viz_., Sushumn\xc4\x81) alone is \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81. The yoga with the ordained\nduration of twelve m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s is called (\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81). That which never decays is\nAkshara (Om) which is without ghosha (third, fourth, and fifth letters from\nK), consonant, vowel, palatal, guttural, nasal, letter R and sibilants. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a\ntravels through (or goes by) that path through which this Akshara (Om) goes.\nTherefore it should be practised daily, in order to pass along that (course).\nIt is through the opening (or hole) of the heart, through the opening of v\xc4\x81yu\n(probably navel), through the opening of the head and through the opening of\nmoksha. They call it bila (cave), sushira (hole), or ma\xe1\xb9\x87dala (wheel). 1\n\n(Then about the obstacles of yogi). A yogin should always avoid fear, anger,\nlaziness, too much sleep or waking and too much food or fasting. If the above\nrule be well and strictly practised each day, spiritual wisdom will arise of\nitself in three months without doubt. In four months, he sees the \xe1\xb8\x8devas; in\nfive months, he knows (or becomes) Brahmanishtha; and truly in six months he\nattains Kaivalya at will. There is no doubt.\n\nThat which is of the earth is of five m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s (or it takes five m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s to\npronounce P\xc4\x81r\xe1\xb9\xadhiva-Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava). That which is of water of four m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s; of agni,\nthree m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s; of v\xc4\x81yu, two; and of \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, one. But he should think of that\nwhich is with no m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s. Having united \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 with manas, one should contemplate\nupon \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 by means of \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 is thirty 2 digits long. Such is the\nposition (or range) of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as. That is called Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a which is the seat of the\nexternal pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as. The breaths by\n\np. 219\n\nday and night are numbered as 1,13,180. 1 (Of the pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as) the first ( _viz_.,)\nPr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a is pervading the heart; Ap\xc4\x81na, the anus; Sam\xc4\x81na, the navel; U\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81na, the\nthroat; and Vy\xc4\x81na, all parts of the body. Then come the colours of the five\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as in order. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a is said to be of the colour of a blood-red gem (or\ncoral); Ap\xc4\x81na which is in the middle is of the colour of In\xe1\xb8\x8dragopa (an insect\nof white or red colour); Sam\xc4\x81na is between the colour of pure milk and crystal\n(or oily and shining), between both (Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and Ap\xc4\x81na): U\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81na is ap\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87dara (pale\nwhite); and Vy\xc4\x81na resembles the colour of archis (or ray of light). That man\nis never reborn wherever he may die, whose breath goes out of the head after\npiercing through this ma\xe1\xb9\x87dala (of the pineal gland). That man is never reborn.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[216:1](tmu28.htm#fr_180) The Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d treating of N\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da (spiritual sound)\nwhich is Am\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xada (nectar). Here Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as are spoken of, as they produce N\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da\nwithin and without.\n\n[216:2](tmu28.htm#fr_181) It is said to be the subtle, gross and other\nmicrocosmic bodies. It also means sign.\n\n[216:3](tmu28.htm#fr_182) It is said to be the macrocosmic bodies of Vir\xc4\x81t,\netc. It means a word or letter.\n\n[216:4](tmu28.htm#fr_183) In this classification, t\xc4\x81rka is introduced newly.\nIt means; the examination of the mind being attracted to objects and knowing\nthat si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis are impediments to progress.\n\n[217:1](tmu28.htm#fr_184) The vy\xc4\x81h\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadis are Bh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb8\xa5, [Bhuva\xe1\xb8\xa5](errata.htm#15),\netc., and the head is Om, \xc4\x80po, etc.\n\n[217:2](tmu28.htm#fr_185) Lit., car-circle which is a mystical chakra or\ndiagram for invoking the \xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81; but some commentators make ra\xe1\xb9\xadha mean Om: and\nma\xe1\xb9\x87dala, the circle of \xc5\x9aiva.\n\n[218:1](tmu28.htm#fr_186) There are four openings in the body; three from\nwhich the astral, the lower mental and the higher mental bodies escape: the\nlast being of \xe1\xb9\xadurya.\n\n[218:2](tmu28.htm#fr_187) As measured by the width of the middle finger:\nY\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya says, Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a is 12 digits beyond the body.\n\n[219:1](tmu28.htm#fr_188) One commentator makes it thus: Taking 21,600 for\neach of the five Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, we get 1,08,000: for the five sub-pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, 5 \xc3\x97 1036 is\n5,180. Hence the total is 1,13,180. Another commentator makes it 21,600 alone.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 27. Var\xc4\x81ha-Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d of K\xe1\xb9\x9bsh\xe1\xb9\x87a-Yajurve\xe1\xb8\x8da](tmu29.htm)\n\n'
