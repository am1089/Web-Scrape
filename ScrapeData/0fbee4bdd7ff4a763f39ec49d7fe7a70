What God  \nshall we adore with our oblation?  \n26 Who in his might surveyed the floods enclosing productive  \nforce and generating Worship,  \nHe who is God mid Gods, and none beside him\xc2\x97What God  \nshall we adore with our oblation?  \n27 The teams wherewith thou seekest him who offers, within  \nhis house, O Vayu, to direct him,  \nTherewith send wealth to us with full enjoyment, a hero son  \nand gifts of kine and horses.  \n28 With thy yoked teams in hundreds and in thousands come  \nto our sacrifice and solemn worship.  \nO Vayu, make thee glad at this libation.

Let us serve  \nhim for offering our gifts.  \nIn battles may he be our help and strengthener, yea, be the  \nsaviour of our lives.  \n45 Thou art Samvatsara; thou art Parivatsara; thou art  \nIdavatsara; thou art Idvatsara; thou art Vatsara.  \nProsper thy Dawns! Prosper thy Day-and-Nights! Prosper  \nthy Half-months, Months, Seasons, and Years!  \nCombine them for their going and their coming, and send  \nthen forward on their ordered courses.  \nIn eagle's shape thou art piled up and layered. With that  \ndivinity, Angiras-like, lie steady.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XXVIII](wyvbk28.htm)\n\n"
