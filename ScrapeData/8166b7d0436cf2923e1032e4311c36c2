A householder shall take a wife (of) equal (caste), who has not belonged\nto another man and is younger (than himself). 1\n\n2\\. A marriage (may be contracted) between persons who have not the same\nPravaras, 2\n\n3\\. (And) who are not related within six degrees on the father\'s side, 3\n\n4\\. Or on the side of the begetter, 4\n\np. 197\n\n5\\. (Nor) within four degrees on the mothers side. 5\n\n6\\. (If the father) gives (his daughter) dressed (in two garments) and decked\nwith ornaments to a person possessing (sacred) learning, of virtuous conduct,\nwho has relatives and a (good) disposition, (that is a) Brahma (wedding). 6\n\n7\\. At the Pra _g_ apatya (wedding) the marriage formula is, \'Fulfil ye the\nlaw conjointly.\' 7\n\n8\\. At the \xc3\x82rsha (wedding the bridegroom) shall present a cow and a bull to\nhim who has (authority over) the maiden. 8\n\n9\\. (If the bride) is given, decked with ornaments. to a priest at the altar,\nthat is a Daiva wedding. 9\n\n10\\. The spontaneous union with a willing (maiden is called) a Gandharva\nwedding. 10\n\n11\\. If those who have (authority over) a female are propitiated by money,\n(that is) an \xc3\x82sura wedding. 11\n\n12\\. (If the bride) is taken by force, (that is) a Rakshasa wedding. 12\n\n13\\. If (a man) embraces a female deprived of consciousness, (that is) a Pai\n_s_ a _k_ a wedding. 13\n\n14\\. The first four (rites) are lawful; 14\n\n15\\. Some say, (the first) six. 15\n\np. 198\n\n16\\. (Children) born in the regular order of wives of the next, second or\nthird lower castes (become) Savar _n_ as, Ambash _th_ as, Ugras, Nishadas,\nDaushyantas or Para _s_ avas. 16\n\n17\\. (Children born) in the inverted order (of wives of higher castes become)\nSutas, Magadhas, \xc3\x82yogavas, Kshatt _ri_ s, Vaidehakas or _K_ a _n_ _d_ alas. 17\n\n18\\. Some declare, that a woman of the Brahma _n_ a caste has born\nsuccessively to (husbands of) the (four) castes, sons (who are) Brahma _n_ as,\nSutas, Magadhas or _K_ a _n_ _d_ alas; 18\n\n19\\. (And that) a woman of the Kshatriya caste (has born) to the same,\nMurdhavasiktas, Kshatriyas, Dhivaras, Pulkasas;\n\n20\\. Further, a woman of the Vai _s_ ya caste to the same, Bh _ri_ _g_ yaka\n_n_ _th_ as, Mahishyas, Vai _s_ yas, and Vaidehas;\n\n21\\. (And) a woman of the _S_ udra caste to the same, Para _s_ avas, Yavanas,\n_K_ ara _n_ as, and _S_ udras.\n\np. 199\n\n22\\. In the seventh (generation men obtain) a change of caste, either being\nraised to a higher one or being degraded to a lower one. 22\n\n23\\. The venerable teacher declares (that this happens) in the fifth\n(generation). 23\n\n24\\. And (the same rule applies) to those born (from parents of different\nclasses that are) intermediate between (two of the castes originally) created\n(by Brahman). 24\n\n25\\. But those born in the inverse order (from fathers of a lower and mothers\nof a higher caste stand) outside (the pale of) the sacred law, 25\n\np. 200\n\n26\\. As well as (those born in the regular order) from a female of the _S_\nudra caste. 26\n\n27\\. But he whom a _S_ udra (begets) on a female of unequal caste shall be\ntreated like an outcast. 27\n\n28\\. The last (named, the Ka _n_ _d_ ala), is the foulest. 28\n\n29\\. Virtuous sons (born of wives of equal caste) and wedded according to\napproved rites sanctify (their father\'s family).\n\n30\\. (A son born of a wife married) according to the \xc3\x82rsha rite (saves) three\nancestors (from hell), 30\n\n31\\. (A son born of a wife married) according to the Daiva rite ten, 31\n\n32\\. (A son born of a wife married) according to the Pra _g_ apatya rite, also\nten. 32\n\n33\\. (But) the son of a wife married according to the Brahma rite (saves) ten\nancestors, ten descendants, and himself. 33\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[196:1](sbe0268.htm#fr_911) **IV**. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 13, 1; Manu III. 4, 12;\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_.

Compare for this and the following five Sutras\nManu X, 6-18; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 91-95.\n\n[198:17](sbe0268.htm#fr_927) I.e. from a Kshatriya and a Brahma _n_ i springs\na Suta, from a Vai _s_ ya and a Kshatriya a Magadha, from a _S_ udra and a Vai\n_s_ ya an \xc3\x82yogava, from a Vai _s_ ya and a Brahma _n_ i a Kshatt _ri_ , from a\n_S_ udra and a Kshatriya a Vaidehaka, from a _S_ udra and a Brahma _n_ i a Ka\n_n_ _d_ ala.\n\n[198:18](sbe0268.htm#fr_928) The words \'Some declare\' stand only at the end of\nSutra 21. But Haradatta rightly declares that they refer to all the four\nSutras. The proof for the correctness of his interpretation lies in the use of\nthe form a _g_ i _g_ anat, which refers to each of the Sutras. The four Sutras\nare, however, probably spurious, as Sutra 28 refers back to Sutra 17 by\ncalling the Ka _n_ _d_ ala \'the last (named).\'\n\n[199:22](sbe0268.htm#fr_929) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 11, 10-11. \'That is as follows:\nIf a Savar _n_ a female, born of the Kshatriya wife of a Brahma _n_ a, is\nmarried to a Brahma _n_ a, and her female descendants down to the seventh\nlikewise, then the offspring which that seventh female descendant bears to her\nBrahma _n_ a husband is equal in caste to a Brahma _n_ a. In like manner, if a\nSavar _n_ a male, the son of a Brahma _n_ a and of his Kshatriya wife, again\nmarries a Kshatriya wife and his male descendants down to the seventh\nlikewise, then the offspring of that seventh male descendant is equal in caste\nto a Kshatriya. The same principle must be applied to the offspring of\nKshatriyas and wives of the Vai _s_ ya caste as well as to Vai _s_ yas and\nwives of the _S_ udra caste.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[199:23](sbe0268.htm#fr_930) \'(The venerable) teacher opines that the change\nof caste takes place in the fifth generation. They declare that the plural may\nbe used to denote one teacher. This Sutra refers to (cases of extraordinary\nmerit acquired through) virtuous conduct and study of the Veda.\'--Haradatta.\nIt is clear that in this case Haradatta, too, has seen that the word a _k_\narya _h_ has another force than the more common eke; see above, note to III,\n36.\n\n[199:24](sbe0268.htm#fr_931) \'That is as follows: If the daughter of a Savar\n_n_ a, born of a wife of the Ambash _th_ a caste, is married again to a Savar\n_n_ a, and her female descendants down to the seventh likewise, then the\noffspring of that seventh female descendant, begotten by a Savar _n_ a\nhusband, is equal in caste to a Savar _n_ a.\'--Haradatta. Regarding the birth\nof the four castes from Brahman, see Rig-veda X, 90, 12.\n\n[199:25](sbe0268.htm#fr_932) Manu X, 41, 67-68.\n\n[200:26](sbe0268.htm#fr_933) Manu X, 68.\n\n[200:27](sbe0268.htm#fr_934) \'"Shall be treated like an outcast," i.e. one\nmust avoid to look at him, &c., just as in the case of an outcast.\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[200:28](sbe0268.htm#fr_935) Manu X, p. 56.\n\n[200:30](sbe0268.htm#fr_936) Manu III, 38; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_.
