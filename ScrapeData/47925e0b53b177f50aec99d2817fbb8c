If thou meditate not, but remain\nstill shalt thou reach it? By thinking neither on thought nor on the absence,\nthis is true path and beatitude.\n\n101\n\nIf thou fix the sight of both thy eyes equally and thy mind he similarly\nfixed, if thou restrain all external tastes and heedfully gaze, the deity\nshall be made evident to thee.\n\n102\n\nClosing the external nine and mingling the internal airs with your mind, if,\nunderstanding this secret you perform the worship of the ( _atmalingam_ )\nDivinity, this is the beatitude.\n\np. 33\n\n103\n\nLet the pure saint confuse all his connections (valenu for valenu) in this\noutward world in conformity to his high desires. In his outward connections be\nthus dissolved he shall attain heaven and beatitude ( _Kailasa and Mukti_ ) .\n\n104\n\nQuickly stop your anus with your left heel and fasten your anus and part of\ngeneration. Then set thy desire in thy mind on the unseen (secret) and behold\nhim.\n\n105\n\nHe whose mind sleeps in abstraction is the great saint wherever he lies, the\nsecurest situation is the (destruction) retention of respiration. He who can\nsecurely loose his apertures ( _mudras_ ) they being fixed of themselves\nbecomes the chief. He is not entangled in connections; is alone the\nindependent sage. (lit: Indifferent)\n\n106\n\nHe who maketh his inmost mind pure (or who maketh his inside his outside) and\nslays all worldliness, burneth his caste and casting off all qualities hath\nattained the reflection of reflections. He is the devotee.\n\np. 34\n\n107\n\nIf thou truly understand, thou cannot seek god. Then can't see him if thou\nmove not thy eyeballs. If thou wink not thy eyelids, he will appear betwixt\nthem.\n\n108\n\nHe who fixing his view eagerly on the end of the nose, looking into his heart,\nhath noble might. If he knows the path of beatitude, h becomes the exalted\ndevotee.\n\n109\n\nThe spirit that is named unparalleled being united with the spirit of his\npristine name will be destroyed in one mode. That mode Vemana will teach thee.\n\n110\n\nHe who has severed the desires of his house from him and duly in his heart is\ncautious; he who thus establishes his house, is deeply skilled in tatwa.\n\n111\n\nHe is the happiest person in the world who in whatever his views and in the\nsix creeds and sects and the four _asramas_ wavers not at any time in his\nwalk.\n\np. 35\n\n112\n\nIt is [impossible](errata.htm#15) for us to see the wondrous writing on the\nnoble hill in our path, following the shadow of our nose. If we go to view, it\nis perfection. It is Siva.\n\n113\n\nA man shall attain long life when he has learnt to low breathing ( _i.e._ to\nsave up some respirations daily of the portion predestined to each man). Then\nshall he grow, he shall wear his body through out the age of Brahma.\n\n114\n\nHe that will not be entangled in the forest of ( _acshara_ ) letters but\nconsidering the (nobleness) charms of ( _acshara_ ) the indestructible, and in\nthis earth adores the prime letter ( _Om_ ) this man shall become Imperishable\n( _acshaya_ ). This is sufficient!\n\n115\n\nThere is no distinct region named deity; self is evidently the deity. If thou\nknow thyself thou art the divinity.\n\np. 36\n\n116\n\nThe whole world exists in the divine atom. The divine atom lies hid in our\nbody The man that restrains his mind will surely attain beatitude ( _mucti_ ).\n\n117\n\nLike him who, holding butter in his hand, but not knowing its properties,\nwishes for ghee (which he might obtain by merely melting the butter) is he who\nbeing himself divinity meditates on God as though removed from him.\n\n118\n\nBy beholding the first of being thou shalt become united with the universe. No\nman is able to behold that prime existence. That prime who is the path of\nbliss existeth within the soul.\n\n119\n\nHe who knows clearly in his own mind that he is a part of the universe,\ninternally and externally, the man who hath brightly learned this shall in\nthis world attain beatitude.\n\np. 37\n\n120\n\nBy not knowing clearly the corporal frame that exists in the external frame,\nthose that are without become outcast. To know that external that is within\nthis external--this is Divine knowledge.\n\n121\n\nAll matter is concreted in the world and all is again resolved into space.\nThat which we call the Divinity if we comprehend it, beatitude shall be\nmanifested to us.\n\n122\n\nIf thou make the face of the heaven and thy own face to be one and manifest\nthe true nature of the external figure of the divinity, thou shalt by knowing\noutward external attain bliss. (loose version, the original being more\nobscure).\n\n123\n\nAll connections are produced in this world; they are not aboriginal; and those\nties shall again be [resolved](errata.htm#16) into primordial matter--view\nthis well, if these connections be doomed to become resolved into space, then\nthe path to beatitude is found to be in void ([paraphrase](errata.htm#17)).\n\np. 38\n\n124\n\nThe god knows him who is in the eye pupil: behold in the sky, Him who is in\nthe pupil. The eye and the sky become the sky of the heart.\n\n125\n\nA man must become eternal by knowing the source of truth; and learning\ncarefully the inmost word (the signification of the scriptures or _upanishads_\n) consider who that word is and closely view it.\n\n126\n\nIf thou know the five lettered name of Namassiva thou knowest the supreme! If\nthou know the supreme, thou shalt for ever shine. He who shines glorious\nbecometh the Spirit.\n\n127\n\nIf the unborn enters our inner man as we meditate, we shall attain beatitude,\nbut never shalt thou attain it by gazing on external shapes.\n\np. 39\n\n128\n\nIf by holding the Linga we become resolved into primitive nature, gazing on\nour bodies, we shall be happy. But men will not know the signification of the\nLinga, and thereby attain that coalescence. (Observe this curious grammatical\nconstruction)\n\n129\n\nThe teacher, the image of Siva, compounded the three worlds into one, and\ncombined the six worlds; thus he [remains](errata.htm#18) firm (these nine\nworlds, or regions are the nine mystic _chacras_ of the human form).\n\n130\n\nIf, ignorant of the postures thou [learn](errata.htm#19) not of thy teacher,\ntheir secret force ( _murma & curma_) and fix not thy heart how shalt thou\nbecome of the second birth? ( _Dwija_ signifying a Brahmin, means, reform-\nregenerate)\n\n131\n\nThe body is the Mundane Egg; what is called soul is air. The eyes are the moon\nand sun in our estimation. Where is there a Divinity beyond this? Ye are gods\nin your own estimation.\n\np. 40\n\n132\n\nWe are born in air and grown in air. Understand the order of blessing in the\nair. For, from air is born that air of the soul which is our essence.\n\n133\n\nHe who has himself become the universe and knows that the great whole dwells\nin him and who has learned to unite his inner man with all that is external\nthis man while yet on earth, has attained perfection.\n\n134\n\nMeditate on the thought that is within our thought and know it; this thou must\ndo in the appropriate mode by giving up all thy other thoughts. The thought of\nthought is essence ( _tatwa_ ); it is soul (or it is the essential spirit).\n\n135\n\nConnection originates in this outward world. Let it be resolved again into\nuniverse. If we resolve it fairly into universe, this is the path to\nhappiness.\n\np. 41\n\n136\n\nIf thou become the universe, the great all shall shine resplendent in thee,\nthat man who knoweth the god who shineth within him shall hereby attain\nbeatitude.\n\n137\n\nIf thou canst see that the all is one, thou shalt attain a sure knowledge of\nGod; thy eye-lid shall not close night or day. Behold that great spirit that\nis the light of light.\n\n138\n\nUnless thy outward form be (humbled) mortified thou shall not see the living\nform. But who is able to mortify that outward form? Unless the creation be\ndestroyed, we cannot behold the creation.\n\n139\n\nAll fear belongs to the body; If we quit fear the certainly we shall attain\nwill be that of the great spirit; the only destruction shall be that of the\nbody. Teach men that victory is the property of the soul.\n\np. 42\n\n140\n\nThe _yogee_ who knows the one letter (Om) shall know the ( _param_ ) Deity,\nbeholding him and attain his nature. He shall himself become the forms in\nwhich the Deity exists and all the rest of the creation, becoming a particle\nof the primeval unity.\n\n141\n\nThe _yogee_ who raiseth his palms aloft fixeth his feet, fixeth his gaze full\non heaven becometh hereby part of the universe and attaineth length of days.\n\n142\n\nConsider that fire, and air, and all worlds exist in the body at their proper\nplaces. Then touch and behold the Teacher in thy mind.\n\n143\n\nIf thou quit not the hopes of the place above and devise a mode attain it,\nthou shalt arrive therein, that place and thou shalt be united, and thou shalt\nbecome the self-existent Deity.\n\np. 43\n\n144\n\nHe is himself metamorphosed into the worship and into the worshipper that\nperforms adoration. He [becomes](errata.htm#20) himself sacrificial implement.\nWherever he performs worship he becomes himself (Omnipresent). He is myself,\nand I myself am, he.\n\n145\n\nAll that is born on the earth was born in the earth. All reality is born in\nthe body. The great whole is produced from toil . Let us ourselves become that\nmighty whole.\n\n146\n\nIf the soul be closely united with the body though it be devout, unless it\nquits, the body is not blessed. Through the body must we attain the abode of\nbeatitude.\n\n147\n\nIf thou know that the prime existent is single and fix thy mind on that prime,\nnever [quitting](errata.htm#21) the prime thou shalt become the unborn. He\nthat path quitted the prime is like to the blind.\n\np. 44\n\n148\n\nWithout making distinctions of situations (lit, without saying there or here)\nas we behold all things, the god (Vishnu) ever views and comprehends all\nthings. The circumambient (God [Vishnu](errata.htm#22)) goes around the orbit\nof the world.\n\n149\n\nBy considering forms thou shalt attain the unseen and thy form shall\nassimilate to his. Devoid of both these (i.e., body and mind) become thus\ninvisible. (loose version)\n\n150\n\nBy viewing thyself inwardly, thou shalt become the joy of the world. By\nviewing what is external, thou shalt be immersed in earthly connections. By\nbeholding thyself, the divinity shall become thy salvation.\n\n151\n\nThat divinity who is our rescue is attained by deep thought. If thou\ncomprehend him by meditation thou shalt become that being, If thou know the\nthought of thought, thou shalt become it.\n\np. 45\n\n152\n\nAll those who possess pure wisdom gaze of the Mundane Oval. If thy mind be\npure, thou shalt ever gaze on the admirable _pindanda_ universe of the body.\n\n153\n\nBeing born in a human generation and grown up in it, if, after becoming a man,\na man cries scorn on the line of men, and (become a _Haracula_ ) becomes a\nparticipator in the nature of Siva; he shall become Siva.\n\n154\n\nThe devotee who knoweth the great secret walketh with out considering the\n[burning](errata.htm#23) sunshine, he shall live to all time on the earth. Is\nthe attainment of wisdom in the power of a glutton?\n\n155\n\nTo nourish our bodies let us cease from all mental occupation and by the aid\nof the living being let us daily rove free from care. By considering our\nbodies, we shall perceive that the Divine soul permanently resides within us.\n\np. 46\n\n156\n\nIn the one body of the universe there are forms innumerable. How many forms\nshine in it! When they perish all shall become one whole. Thus is the nature\nof spirit. (This ataveladi has four versions).\n\n157\n\n(A difficult verse in pure Telugu)\n\nIt is only one man here and there who can try and explain the second birth of\n( _yatees_ ) the recluse with extreme exactitude. It is an\n[extraordinary](errata.htm#24) qualification; sense is more stable than even\nworship.\n\n158\n\nWhere is heaven for that soul full of cupidity, that thinks his body is his\nown self and entangled in his own (v\xc4\x81sana, smell) attractions ensnared in\nrepeated births and deaths. Ignorant of all matter wallows in lusts.\n\n159\n\nHe who grips his foot in the palm of his hand and with an eye fixed on heaven\nstands firm. He shines transformed into the universe and shall live long.\n\np. 47\n\n160\n\nThose voluptuaries who forget their thoughts and principles (i.e., themselves;\nlit. _chitta_ is the faculty of doubt and _buddhi_ that of assurance) are\ngiven up to vain confidence and cannot collect their whole attention and fix\nit on Siva. They shall never attain bliss (terribly difficult).\n\n161\n\nHow should those who imagine themselves to be one with their body, and who\nremain immersed in the ocean of the cursed three attachments (to wife, son and\nwealth) attain the knowledge ( _sangati_ ) of the truth ( _moksham_ ).\n\n162\n\nHe exists in the shape of the universe and is the general soul. He is the all\nwitnessing spirit. He hath truly converted.. himself into the soul. Look at\nthe universal world. He is himself all and even exists in truth.\n\n163\n\nHe that has seen is greater than who has heard. But he that possesses Him is\ngreater than who hath beheld. Greatest of the noble is he in the earth.\n\np. 48\n\n164\n\nIt thou firmly fix the idea of the divinity in the mind, and establish thyself\nin the temple of the body, thou shalt be firm in the earth and attain the\ninner vision.\n\n165\n\nIf thou excuse that life ( _jiva tatwa_ ) that possesses the marks of\nvitality, to be united to the teacher, he is greater than the life. He who\nthus restrains the body is himself.\n\n166\n\nThe great whole exists within us. If we know that we are, if, by this means of\nsalvation in this soul shall the man who thus walks attains heaven.\n\n167\n\nIf a man be converted into his intrinsic self in the midst of all external he\nwould contract no alienation. I swear by my father. If we were converted into\nself how should we entertain any anxiety?\n\np. 49\n\n168\n\nIf he be himself prudent cautiously will he save himself, and in every manner\nhe considers himself as the great spirit.\n\n169\n\nIf he knows that he is himself the universe and the universe himself; that he\nis himself all essence, if, knowing this he fails to walk accordingly, there\nis no salvation for that map.\n\n170\n\n(Pure Sanskrit) Water, earth, fire, sky, air--it is well known that these\ncompose the world. The natural body, the invisible form, the body of delusion,\nif thought on, are the basis of all.\n\n171\n\nTo say I will not this (i.e., wish not for it) and still not to leave it but\nremain entangled in the desire of things convenient nor quit them. This is\norigin of worldliness.\n\n172\n\np. 50\n\nIf the face and name are unalterable, the name and the face are both\nimplicated in our acts. It would be well if we could lose both our name and\nface.\n\n173\n\nThe devotee to Siva who understands all the properties of the body, shall not\nentangled in desire and deceived to his ruin. How should a juggler be ensnared\nby any man?\n\n174\n\nThe exalted sages have declared in the earth that when through instruction a\nman relinquishes the desires (or schemes) of his mind, he shall through his\nlove of them attain the abode of purities.\n\n175\n\nIf thou be thyself excellent, but, as the bliss be wedded to nature and ruin\nthy beatification thou shall not behold that preceptor who caused the creation\nof precepts.\n\n176\n\nDoth an infant know any thing of (dressing) roasting stones to extract metals?\nThe god-like sage alone comprehends it. Know thou the degraded nature metal\nand leave it?\n\np. 51\n\n177\n\nIf thy mortal form perish, thy inward eye shall clearly shine. If the fruits\nbe destroyed that tree becomes free as the tree of desire. If thy eye be\nhumbled to see with it is happiness.\n\n178\n\nWhere is shame hidden? Where is the darkness of [ignorance](errata.htm#25)\nhidden? Where is hunger hidden? In the soul! Learn ye the hiding of the\n[hidden](errata.htm#26) sleep of abstraction.\n\n179\n\nLook on thy chief (jewels or foes) passions! Haste to destroy them nourish the\nwhole of thy friends (or lovers). He who thus behold the great light and in\nthe midst of the body fixes his [desire](errata.htm#27)\\--this man is himself\nHari.\n\n180\n\nOur own shadow is our foe, and our shadow is a witness to us of our bulk in\n[the](errata.htm#28) body; my passions are my enemies and my mind is the only\naid I have. This is true.\n\np. 52\n\n181\n\nTo cut off the evils (diseased) of the body ceasing the look of love towards\nthe robbers (evil wishes) knowing the [origin](errata.htm#29), attaching our\n[thought](errata.htm#30) to him and uniting the mind to him--If the devotee\nthus recognizes the (friendship) mutual love between the creature and the\ncreator, this is the institute of sanctity.\n\n182\n\nThough the sage be touched (or affected) by any object of sense, he is not in\ntruth moved truly. Vemana hath learnt, in the host of sensual objects and\npassions to abstain from the six evils ( _cama, crodha, lobha, moha, mada,\nmatsara_ ) and all other sources of sin ( _durvishaya_ ). (a tremendous\npuzzle, but correctly done.)\n\n183\n\nIf we consider our real form however great we may seem in our own delusions,\nand those of ascetics, and be filled with them can we hereby see god.\n\n184\n\nHe that hath seen and can name the place of his [primordial](errata.htm#31)\nbirth, walks in wisdom in the earth; the place of our origin is in the\ndivinity (tatwa).\n\np. 53\n\n185\n\nFrom fire which was produced from air was water created; in the atmosphere it\nappeared, being self born; such is the history of _Maya_ , that had no father.\n\n186\n\nThose who in their minds muse on the gem on the summit of essence are\n[skilled](errata.htm#32) in _tatwa_. He who hath truly beheld in the midst of\ndarkness, the great light, this is the devotee. He who truly knoweth that the\nsoul exists in God and God in the soul hath religious vision. He is the pure,\nwho in the _Sankhya yogamu_ (which enumerates the qualities of spirit) hath\nascertained that the entire world is in Siva. In any but this path shall any\none ever attain the deity? If the life leave the belly, and depart how should\nit be puffed up?\n\n187\n\np. 59\n\nIf thou walk not so as to become free from. (set aside) all the evil qualities\nof thy acts how should thou acquire the divine essence? Will a lamp devoid of\noil blaze merely by filling it with dry sesasum oil seeds--that are not freed\nfrom their hurtful substance.\n\n188\n\nLike as the seeds and the husk (between themselves) are born together in water\nbut the husk (goes) is destroyed so the concomitant evil fruits of his acts\nwho knows the essence of God will leave him undefiled--Indeed it is thus.\n\n189\n\nActs of religion are far removed from the wise and the wise is far from acts\nin _Caliyuga_. The man of purity who ceaseth both works and knowledge truly\nhath attained beatitude, For, when he is perfect, faith and works shall both\nterminate.\n\n190\n\nIf thou be not a performer of acts thou knowest not good works. He who is\ntrueth to works shall not see any good. Unless thou enter the water, surely\nthou can't know the depth; nor, devoid of works know happiness.\n\n191\n\np. 55\n\nIf thou look upon the fruits of thy actions as being defiled will hypocrisy;\nthen shalt thou attain the fruits of thy righteousness. Felicity consists in\nsurpassing both thy righteousness and thy good works.\n\n192\n\nFruits (senses) produced in a tree (the body) exulting, united in fair beauty,\nripen--eat the fruits (beatitude) and know the leaves of a tree. (Here it is\n[impossible](errata.htm#33) to discriminate in English between _caya_ and\n_pandu_ ).\n\n193\n\nLike as a swan will not touch the ( _mansodakam_ ) heavenly stream but turns\nit off, thus let the yogee be untouched by acts; he shall ramble in all\ndelight.\n\n194\n\nSearching well into the body and setting God before our eyes, and throwing\naside our future acts, verifying our mind and quitting the love of our various\nties, he that applies himself to stand there, is the best:\n\n195\n\nThe _Puranas_ of acts are a great deep. In those acts never shall we see Siva;\nsurely none is able to declare Siva, the destroyer of acts. Acts are vile, and\nvile.\n\np. 58\n\n196\n\nVishnu, Brahma, the demigods, the _munis_ and all the rest were nobly born and\nthen lost their state of happiness, regularly proceeded through the state of\ndecrepitude and death. This was through the savour of delusion.\n\n197\n\nThey who perpetually enquire which among three Gods is the chief (or root)\ncannot, being fools, know the chief--surely there is a higher root of the\nthree.\n\n198\n\nThere are men who being unable first to perceive which is the noblest of the\nthree, go into destruction. There is one original substance of which the three\nare formed.\n\n199\n\n[Know](errata.htm#34) ye ([ascertain](errata.htm#35) and learn) that root that\nknoweth the three. First know Him who is above the three and extol him with\nthe tongue.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 200-299](vov04.htm)\n\n"
