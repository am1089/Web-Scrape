Good harvests, or bad, the farmer was always poor, the money-\nlender rich. At the last, when he hadn\'t a farthing left, the farmer went to\nthe money-lender\'s house, and said, "You can\'t squeeze water from a stone, and\nas you have nothing to get by me now, you might tell me the secret of becoming\nrich."\n\n"My friend," returned the money-lender, piously, "riches come from Ram--ask\n_him_."\n\n"Thank you, I will!" replied the simple farmer; so he prepared three girdle-\ncakes to last him on the journey, and set out to find Ram.\n\nFirst he met a Brahman, and to him he gave a cake, asking him to point out the\nroad to Ram; but the Brahman only took the cake and went on his way without a\nword. Next the fanner met a Jogi or devotee, and to him he gave a cake,\nwithout receiving any help in return. At last, he came upon a poor man sitting\nunder a tree, and finding out he was hungry, the kindly farmer gave him the\nlast cake, and sitting down to rest beside him, entered into conversation.\n\n"And where are you going?" asked the poor man, at length.\n\n"Oh I have a long journey before me, for I am going to find Ram!" replied the\nfarmer. "I don\'t suppose you could tell me which way to go?"\n\n"Perhaps I can," said the poor man, smiling, "for _I_ am Ram! What do you want\nof me?"\n\nThen the farmer told the whole story, and Ram, taking pity on him, gave him a\nconch shell, and showed him how to to blow it in a particular way, saying,\n"Remember! whatever you wish for, you have only to blow the conch that way,\nand your wish will be fulfilled. Only have a care of that money-lender, for\neven magic is not proof against their wiles!"\n\nThe farmer went back to his village rejoicing. In fact the money-lender\nnoticed his high spirits at once, and said to himself, "Some good fortune must\nhave befallen the stupid fellow, to make him hold his head so jauntily."\nTherefore he went over to the simple farmer\'s house, and congratulated him on\nhis good fortune, in such cunning words, pretending to have heard all about\nit, that before long the farmer found himself telling the whole story--all\nexcept the secret of blowing the conch, for, with all his simplicity, the\nfarmer was not quite such a fool as to tell that.\n\nNevertheless the money-lender determined to have the conch by hook or by\ncrook, and as he was villain enough not to stick at trifles, he waited for a\nfavourable opportunity and stole the conch.\n\nBut, after nearly bursting himself with blowing the conch in every conceivable\nway, he was obliged to give up the secret as a bad job. However, being\ndetermined to succeed he went back to the farmer, and said, coolly, "Look\nhere; I\'ve got your conch, but I can\'t use it; you haven\'t got it, so it\'s\ndear you can\'t use it either. Business is at a standstill unless we make a\nbargain. Now, I promise to give you back your conch, and never to interfere\nwith your using it, on one condition, which is this,--whatever you get from\nit, I am to get double."\n\n"Never!" cried the farmer; "that would be the old business all over again!"\n\n"Not at all!" replied the wily money-lender; "you will have your share! Now,\ndon\'t he a dog in the manger, for if _you_ get all you want, what can it\nmatter to you if _I_ am rich or poor?"\n\nAt last, though it went sorely against the grain to be of any benefit to a\nmoney-lender, the farmer was forced to yield, and from that time, no matter\nwhat he gained by the power of the conch, the money-lender gained double. And\nthe knowledge that this was so preyed upon the farmer\'s mind day and night, so\nthat he had no satisfaction out of anything.\n\nAt last, there came a very dry season,--so dry that the farmer\'s crops\nwithered for want of rain. Then he blew his conch, and wished for a well to\nwater them, and lo! there was the well, _but the money-lender had two!_ \\--two\nbeautiful new wells! This was too much for any farmer to stand; and our friend\nbrooded over it, and brooded over it, till at last a bright idea came into his\nhead. He seized the conch, blew it loudly, and cried out,\n\n"Oh, Ram! I wish to be blind of one eye!" And so he was, in a twinkling, but\nthe moneylender of course was blind of both, and in trying to steer his way\nbetween the two new wells, he fell into one, and was drowned.\n\nNow this true story shows that a farmer once got the better of a money-lender\n--but only by losing one of his eyes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Boy who had a Moon on his Forehead and a Star on his\nChin](ift23.htm)\n\n'
