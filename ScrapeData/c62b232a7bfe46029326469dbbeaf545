 \nI have Physicians famed for skill,  \nEach trained to cure some special ill:  \nMy sweetest lady, tell thy pain,  \nAnd they shall make thee well again.  \nWhom, darling, wouldst thou punished see?  \nOr whom enriched with lordly fee?  \n\np. 102  \n\n"Weep not, my lovely Queen, and stay  \nThis grief that wears thy frame away  \nSpeak, and the guilty shall be freed,  \nThe guiltless be condemned to bleed.  \nThe poor enriched, the rich abased.  \nThe low set high, the proud disgraced.  \nMv lords and I thy will obey,  \nAll slaves who own thy sovereign sway;  \nAnd I can ne\'er my heart incline  \nTo check in aught one wish of thine.  \nNow by my life I pray thee tell  \nThe thoughts that in thy bosom dwell,  \nThe power and might thou knowest wel.  \nShould from thy breast all doubt expel,  \nI swear by all my merit won,  \nSpeak, and thy pleasure shall be done.  \nFar as the world\'s wide bounds extend  \nMy glorious empire knows no end.  \nMine are the tribes in eastern lands,  \nAnd those who dwell on Sindhu\'s sands:  \nMine is Surashtra, far away,  \nSuvira\'s realm admits my sway.  \nMy best the southern nations fear,  \nThe Angas and the Vaugas hear.  \nAnd as lord paramount I reign  \nO\'er Magadh and the Matsyas\' plain,  \nKos\'al, and Kasi\'s wide domain: [1](ry089.htm#fn_273)  \nAll rich in treasures of the mine.  \nIn golden corn, sheep, goats, and kine.  \nChoose what thou wilt. Kaikeyi, thence:  \nBut tell me, O my darling, whence  \nArose thy grief, and it shall fly  \nLike hoar-frost when the sun is high.\'  \n\nShe, by his loving words consoled,  \nLonged her dire purpose to unfold,  \nAnd sought with sharper pangs to wring  \nThe bosom of her lord the king.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[101:1](ry088.htm#fr_272) These verses are evidently an interpolation.
