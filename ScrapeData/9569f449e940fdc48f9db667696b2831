When,\nafter having sported some time, his intellect returned to Shivu, he was filled\nwith anger, and burnt Ramdeo to ashes. When Shivu had burnt the powerful\nRamdeo, Ruti lost all firmness. Without her husband, she was in a state of\ngreat agitation; and became weak and restless. The wife of Ramdeo wandered\nabout, rolling on the ground: and calling on her husband, embraced the ground.\nObserving that she was much distressed at the loss of her husband, Parbutee\nthus addressed her, "O Ruti! be not sad, but listen while I mention how your\nhusband will be restored again to you. He will first be born in the house of\nShree Krishnu Chund, and his name will be Purdiyomun. Afterwards, a demon,\nnamed Sunbur, will carry him off, and set him adrift in the sea; having after\nthis come into the belly of a fish, he will appear in the food of Sunbur: go,\nand take up your abode there, and when your husband arrives, take him and\nbring him up; eventually he shall slay Sunbur, and, having taken you to\nDwarka, shall live there happily with you."\n\np. 237\n\n[paragraph continues] O great king! the wife of Shivu thus advised Ruti, who,\nhaving recovered her spirits, came to the house of Sunbur, and took up her\nabode in his cook-room, and night and day, was in anxious expectation of the\narrival of her husband.\n\nHaving narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja!\nRuti, in expectation of meeting with her husband, began thus to take up her\nabode in the kitchen of Sunbur; and Rookmunee became pregnant; and after the\nfull period of ten months, was delivered of a son. Having obtained\nintelligence of this event, the astrologers came; and having determined upon.\nthe proper moment, said to Basoodeo Jee, "O great king! on beholding the\nfavourable planet of this child, we are of opinion, that he will be equal to\nShree Krishnu Chund Jee in beauty, qualities of mind and strength: but during\nhis childhood, he will dwell in water; and hereafter, having slain his enemy,\nwill return."\n\nHaving thus spoken, the astrologers named him Purdiyomun, and receiving\npresents took leave; and in the house of Basoodeo, the usual forms and\nceremonies were observed, and there were festive rejoicings. Narud Jee, the\nsage, after this went to Sunbur, and, having entered into an explanation with\nhim, said, "Why are you asleep at this time; are you without all thought?" He\nenquired the reason of the question, and Narud replied, "Thy enemy, named\nPurdiyomun, one of the descents upon earth of Ramdeo, has been born in the\nhouse of Shree Krishnu Chund Jee."\n\nRaja! Narud Jee having thus informed and put Sun bur on his guard, departed,\nand Sunbur having reflected, and thought over the subject in his mind,\ndetermined upon this plan,--"In the form of air I will go, and will bring him\naway with me thence, and will launch him into the sea, in order that the\ntroubles of my mind may be quieted; and that I may live, free from alarm."\nHaving formed this resolution, Sunbur went thence in an invisible shape, and\narrived at the abode of Shree Krishnu Chund, where Rookmunee Jee was\n\np. 238\n\nnursing and suckling the infant in her chamber; and having silently made all\nhis secret arrangements, stood there. When Rookmunee\'s hand was withdrawn from\nthe child, the demon spread his delusive power, and carried off the infant, so\nas that not one of all the women sitting there knew or saw whether any one had\ncome, and how the child had been carried off. Rookmunee was very much\nfrightened, when she did not see her child, and began to weep. On hearing her\nlamentations, all the descendants of Judoo, male and female, gathered\ntogether, and discoursing variously amongst themselves, were in a state of\ngreat anxiety. In the meanwhile Narud Jee came and explained to them, "Be not\napprehensive on account of the disappearance of the child; there is not the\nslightest cause for fear. The child will go to some other place, but death\nwill not affect it; and when his childhood is passed, he will return to you\nwith a very beautiful wife."\n\nO great king! when Narud, the sage, had thus explained the course of events,\nthe descendants of Judoo reflected on what he had said; and on his taking\nleave, became satisfied, and tranquil in mind. Be pleased now to listen to the\nprogress of the history, how Sunbur, having carried off Purdiyomun, cast him\ninto the sea. A fish swallowed him, and was swallowed by another large fish. A\nfisherman came and throwing a net into the sea, caught the fish. On drawing\nthe net, and seeing the fish, the fisherman was much pleased, and brought it\nhome and subsequently made a present of it to Raja Sunbur, who sent it to his\nkitchen. When the cook cut open the fish another fish came forth; and on\nripping open its belly, a very beautiful child of a black colour made its\nappearance. The cook was greatly astonished, and took away the child, and gave\nit to Ruti, who was highly delighted at receiving it. When Sunbur heard of it,\nhe sent for Ruti, and said to her, "Bring up this child with the greatest\ncare."\n\nOn hearing these words, Ruti brought the child to her own house. Narud Jee\nthen came and said to Ruti, "Bring up this\n\np. 239\n\nchild with the greatest care, as it is your husband, who has appeared in the\nform of Purdiyomun. He will destroy Sunbur, and take you hence, passing his\nchildhood here." Having divulged thus much of the future, Narud, the sage,\ndeparted; and Ruti began to bring up the infant with the greatest care and\naffection. As the child grew up, Ruti became desirous of meeting with her\nhusband. Sometimes, whilst looking at him, she clasped him with affection to\nher bosom; and sometimes kissing his eyes, mouth and cheeks, she smilingly\nclung to his neck, and thus said, "Krishnu has contrived this lucky\ncircumstance, and I have found my husband in a fish;" and O great king! she\nbrought milk for him, and gave it to him in a fond, affectionate manner; and\ndandled him in her arms, singing his praises, and lovingly calling him\n"husband." When Purdiyomun was five years old, Ruti dressed him in all kinds\nof dresses and ornaments to satisfy the longings of her mind, and gratify her\neyes. When the child laid hold of the hem of her garment, and began to call\nher "mother," she replied laughingly, "O husband! what are you saying? I am\nyour wife, think and reflect upon this. Parbutee Jee told me to dwell in the\nhouse of Sunbur; and that my husband should be born in the house of Shree\nKrishnu Chund Jee, and should come to me in the belly of a fish. And Narud Jee\ntold me not to be sad, and that I should recover my husband. From that time I\nhave been in expectation of meeting with you, and have abode here, my hopes\nhave been realized by your coming."\n\nHaving thus spoken, Ruti instructed her husband in the science of archery.\nWhen he had acquired a perfect knowledge, she one day said to him, "Husband!\nwe ought not to stay here any longer, because your mother, Shree Rookmunee\nJee, is as uneasy without you as a cow without its calf, you ought, therefore,\nto slay the demon Sunbur; and, taking me with you, return to Dwarka to your\nparents, and make them happy; for they have a most ardent desire to see you."\n\np. 240\n\nHaving narrated these circumstances, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja,--O\ngreat king! listening in this manner to the discourses of Ruti, when\nPurdiyomun had grown up, he went one day playing to the Raja Sunbur. On\nbeholding him, and regarding him as his own son he said, fondling him, "I have\nbrought this child up as my own son." On hearing these words, Purdiyomun Jee\nreplied with very great anger, "I, though a child, am your enemy; fight with\nme now, and see my strength." Having thus spoken, he came forward, striking\nhis arms in preparation for the encounter; upon this Sunbur laughed, and began\nto say, "Brother! whence has this other Purdiyomun come here on my account?\nWhat, have I fed with milk, and nourished a snake, that he should thus speak\nto me?" After this, he again said, "Son! why do you talk thus? Has the\nmessenger of death come to take you away."\n\nO great king, on hearing these words from Sunbur, he replied, "Purdiyomun is\nmy name: fight with me to-day. You it was, who set me adrift in the sea; but I\nhave now returned to take my revenge. You have brought up the instrument of\nyour death in your own house; and I am neither your son, nor are you my\nfather."\n\nOn hearing this, Sunbur seized his weapons, the passions of his mind being\ngreatly inflamed with rage, like a person, who has trodden on a snake\'s tail\nin the dark. Sunbur sent for all his army, and taking Purdiyomun outside, he,\nin great fury, raised a club, and said in a voice of thunder, "Let us see, who\nwill now save you from death." When he rushed towards him, and brandished the\nclub, Purdiyomun Jee easily evaded and parried his attacks. Being furious with\nrage he then discharged arrows of fire, which he quenched with arrows of\nwater. Sunbur in great wrath then expended all the weapons he had and\nPurdiyomun warded them off. When he had not a single weapon left, he rushed\nforward furiously and grappled with Purdiyomun Jee, and they both began to\nwrestle. After some\n\np. 241\n\ntime, Purdiyomun flew off with him to the sky, and there cut off his head with\na sword; and on his return, slew the army of demons. Sunbur being slain, Ruti\nwas made happy. And at that time, a chariot descended from the sky, on which\nRuti and her husband ascended, and went to Dwarka with the same celerity, as a\nbeautiful cloud with lightning flies; and on arriving there, they observed\nhouses of gold, glittering like lofty hills. On descending from the chariot,\nthey both retired at once to the female apartments. All the women were\nstartled at seeing them; and were ashamed, thinking that Shree Krishnu had\nbrought a beautiful woman with him. But no one knew, that it was Purdiyomun;\nall of them called him Krishnu. When Purdiyomun asked where his father and\nmother were, Rookmunee Jee began to say to her companions, "Friends! who is\nthis in the likeness of Huri?" They replied, "We think, that this must be a\nson of Shree Krishnu\'s."\n\nOn hearing these words, a stream of milk came forth from the breast of\nRookmunee Jee, and her left arm began to shake; and her mind was in a state of\nfear and agitation for the meeting; but without her husband\'s permission, she\ncould not meet him. At that time, Narud Jee came there, and related all the\npreceding history, and tranquillized the minds of them all; then Rookmunee Jee\nran forward, and kissing her son\'s head, clasped him to her bosom; and having\nhis marriage celebrated with all due forms and ceremonies, received her son\nand daughter-in-law into her house. At that time, all the descendants of\nJudoo, men and women, came and joined in festive rejoicings, and were highly\ndelighted. Songs of congratulation resounded in every house, and happiness was\ndiffused throughout the city of Dwarka.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja\nPureechit,--O great king! Purdiyomun having thus been born, having spent his\nchildhood in another place, killed his enemy, and came with Ruti to the city\nof Dwarka, there was joy and festivity in every house.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LVII](psa58.htm)\n\n'
