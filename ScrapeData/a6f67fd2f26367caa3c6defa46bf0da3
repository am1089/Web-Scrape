The Upa _m_ _s_ u (graha), forsooth, is his out-breathing, the Upa\n_m_ _s_ u-savana (stone) his through-breathing,\n\np. 257\n\nand the Antaryama (graha) his in-breathing.\n\n4:1:2:22\\. Now as to why it is called Antaryama. That which is the out-\nbreathing is also the in-breathing and the through-breathing. Now, in drawing\nthe Upa _m_ _s_ u (graha), he puts into him that out-breathing which tends\naway from him; and in drawing the\n\np. 258\n\n[paragraph continues] Antaryama, he puts into him that in-breathing which\ntends towards him. But this same in-breathing is confined within his self; and\nbecause it is confined (yam) within (antar) his self, or because these\ncreatures are sustained (yam) by it, therefore it is called Antaryama.\n\n4:1:2:33\\. He draws it from inside the strainer 1, whereby he puts that in-\nbreathing into him as one tending towards him, and that in-breathing of his is\nplaced (or beneficial) within his self. And thereby also that Upa _m_ _s_ u\n(libation) of his comes to be drawn from inside the strainer (i.e. from the\npure Soma), for one and the same are the Upa _m_ _s_ u and Antaryama, since\nthey are the out-breathing and in-breathing. And thereby, moreover, that\n(vital air) of his comes to be unceasing also at the other grahas.\n\n4:1:2:44\\. Now as to why he purifies the Soma by means of a strainer\n(pavitra). When Soma had oppressed his own family-priest B _ri_ haspati, he\nrestored to him (his property); and on his restoring it, he (B _ri_ haspati)\nbecame reconciled to him. Still there was guilt remaining, if only for having\ncontemplated oppressing the priesthood.\n\n4:1:2:55\\. The gods purified him by some means of purification (or a strainer,\npavitra), and, being cleansed and pure, he became the (sacrificial) food of\nthe gods. And\n\np. 259\n\nin like manner does he now purify him by means of that strainer, and, being\ncleansed and pure, he becomes the food of the gods.\n\n4:1:2:66\\. Then as to why the grahas are drawn with the Upayama 1. Now Aditi\nis this (earth), and hers was that praya _n_ iya oblation, that \xc3\x82ditya rice-\npap 2. But that was, as it were, previous to the Soma feast: she desired to\nhave a share along with the gods in the Soma feast, and said, \'Let there be\nfor me also a share of the pressed Soma!\'\n\n4:1:2:77\\. The gods said, \'This sacrifice has already been distributed among\nthe deities: by means of thee the grahas shall be taken and offered to the\ndeities!\'--\n\np. 260\n\n[paragraph continues] \'So be it!\' This, then, is her share of the pressed\nSoma.\n\n4:1:2:88\\. And, again, why the grahas are drawn with the Upayama. The Upayama\nindeed is this (earth), since it is this (earth) that bears (upa-yam 1) food\nhere for cattle and men and trees; and the gods are above this, for the gods\nare in heaven.\n\n4:1:2:99\\. The reason, then, why the grahas are drawn with the Upayama, is\nthat they are drawn by means of this (earth); and why he deposits them in the\nwomb 2, is that this earth is the womb of everything, that it is from her that\nthese creatures have sprung.\n\n4:1:2:1010\\. That same Soma the priests carry about as seed. And seed which is\ncast outside the womb is lost; but that which he deposits in the womb is\nindeed deposited in this earth.\n\n4:1:2:1111\\. Now these two grahas are his out-breathing and in-breathing; one\nof them he offers after sunrise and the other before sunrise, in order to keep\nthe out-breathing and in-breathing distinct from each other. He thus keeps the\nout-breathing and in-breathing distinct from each other: hence these two, even\nwhile being one and the same, are yet called differently \'out-breathing\' and\n\'in-breathing.\'\n\n4:1:2:1212\\. Now those two grahas are for him day and night; one of them he\noffers after sunrise and the\n\np. 261\n\nother before sunrise, in order to keep day and night distinct from each other:\nhe thus keeps day and night distinct. from each other  1.\n\n4:1:2:1313\\. The Upa _m_ _s_ u, being the day, he offers in the night; and\nthus he puts the day into the night: whence even in the deepest darkness one\ndistinguishes something 2.\n\n4:1:2:1414\\. The Antaryama, being the night, he offers after sunrise, and thus\nhe puts the night into the day: whence that sun, on rising, does not burn up\nthese creatures; whence these creatures are preserved.\n\n4:1:2:1515\\. He draws (the Antaryama graha) therefrom 3 with (Va _g_. S. VII,\n4), \'Thou art taken with a support!\'--The significance of the Upayama has been\ntold 4.--\'Restrain thou, O mighty (Indra), guard Soma!\' the mighty, forsooth,\nis Indra; and Indra is the leader of the sacrifice: wherefore he says \'O\nmighty!\' and by \'guard Soma\' he means to say \'protect Soma!\' \'Preserve the\nriches! gain thee food in the sacrifice!\'--riches mean cattle: \'Protect the\ncattle\' he thereby means to say. \'Gain thee food in the sacrifice!\'--food\nmeans creatures: he thus makes these eager to sacrifice, and these creatures\ngo on sacrificing and praising and toiling.\n\np. 262\n\n4:1:2:1616\\. \'Into thee I lay day and night 1; into thee I lay the wide air:\nallied with the gods, the lower and the higher,\'--thereby he makes this\n(graha) one belonging to all the gods: because by means of it these creatures\nmove about in the air breathing out and breathing in, therefore it belongs to\nall the gods.--\'Delight thyself in the Antaryama, O mighty one!\' the mighty\none is Indra, and Indra is the leader of the sacrifice, wherefore he says \'O\nmighty one!\' and in that he draws it with \'into--into,\' thereby he means to\nsay \'I lay thee into his (Indra\'s) self.\'\n\n4:1:2:1717\\. Having drawn it, he wipes (the vessel) all round, lest (any Soma-\njuice) should trickle down. He does not deposit it; for this is the in-\nbreathing: hence this in-breathing passes unceasingly. But should he desire to\nexorcise, let him deposit it with \'I put thee down, the in-breathing of N.N.!\'\n\n4:1:2:1818\\. If he deposits the Upa _m_ _s_ u, let him also deposit this\n(Antaryama cup) 2; and if he does not deposit the Upa _m_ _s_ u, let him also\nnot deposit this. And if he covers the Upa _m_ _s_ u (with his hand), let him\nalso cover this; and if he does not cover the Upa _m_ _s_ u, let him also not\ncover this: as the performance regarding the Upa _m_ _s_ u, so regarding this\n(graha); for one and the same are these two, the Upa _m_ _s_ u and Antaryama,\nsince they are the out-breathing and in-breathing.\n\n4:1:2:1919\\. Now the _K_ arakas, forsooth, offer these two\n\np. 263\n\n[paragraph continues] (libations) with two different formulas 1, saying,\n\'These two are his out-breathing and in-breathing: we make the out-breathing\nand in-breathing of varied vigour.\' But let him not do this, for they disorder\nthe sacrificer\'s out-breathing and in-breathing. Now, one might also 2 offer\nthis one silently:--\n\n4:1:2:2020\\. But, as he offers the Upa _m_ _s_ u with a formula, even thereby\nthis (libation) also comes to be offered with a formula. How then could one\noffer it silently, for these two, the Upa _m_ _s_ u and Antaryama, are one and\nthe same, since they are the out-breathing and in-breathing?\n\n4:1:2:2121\\. With the very same formula with which he offers the Upa _m_ _s_\nu, he offers this (libation),--\'Self-made thou art: for all powers divine and\nearthly: may the mind obtain thee! Hail!--thee, O well-born, for Surya!\' The\nsignificance of this formula has been told.\n\n4:1:2:2222\\. And, having offered 3, he wipes the cup clean downwards. For even\nnow, after offering the Upa _m_ _s_ u, he wiped (the cup) upwards; but here he\nwipes it downwards; whereby he puts the in-breathing into him as one tending\ntowards him.\n\n4:1:2:2323\\. He then rubs (the wiped-off Soma) upon the middle enclosing stick\nfrom east to west with the palm of his hand turned downwards. For even now,\nafter offering the Upa _m_ _s_ u, he rubbed it upon the\n\np. 264\n\nmiddle enclosing stick from west to east with the palm of his hand turned\nupwards; but here he does so from east to west with the palm of his hand\nturned downwards--whereby he puts the in-breathing into him as one tending\ntowards him--with, \'Thee for the gods sipping motes of light!\' The\nsignificance is the same as before.\n\n4:1:2:2424\\. Having returned (to the cart-shed), he deposits that (cup) with,\n\'Thee for the in-breathing!\' for this is indeed his in-breathing. He deposits\nthem 1 so as to touch one another; whereby he makes out-breathing and in-\nbreathing touch one another, joins the out-breathings and in-breathings\ntogether.\n\n4:1:2:2525\\. Now these (cups and stone) repose without being moved until the\nevening Soma feast, whence men sleep here on earth; and at the evening Soma\nfeast they are used again, whence these men, having slept, awake and are\nbustling and restless;--this, forsooth, is after the manner of the sacrifice,\nfor the sacrifice is fashioned like a bird: the Upa _m_ _s_ u and Antaryama\n(grahas) are its wings, and the Upa _m_ _s_ usavana (stone) its body.\n\n4:1:2:2626\\. They repose without being moved until the evening Soma feast. The\nsacrifice is spread along; but what is spread along moves, whence those birds\nfly spreading their wings, not drawing them in. At the evening Soma feast they\nare again used; whence\n\np. 265\n\nthese birds fly drawing in their wings to fold them: this indeed is after the\nmanner of the sacrifice.\n\n4:1:2:2727\\. The Upa _m_ _s_ u, forsooth, is this (earth), for the Upa _m_ _s_\nu is the out-breathing, and breathing out one breathes upon this (earth). And\nthe Antaryama is yonder (sky), for the Upa _m_ _s_ u is the in-breathing (up-\nbreathing), and in breathing up one breathes towards yonder world. And the Upa\n_m_ _s_ u-savana (stone) is the air, for the Upa _m_ _s_ u-savana is the\nthrough-breathing, and he who breathes through (in and out), breathes through\nthis air.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[256:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_621) The \'Great Pressing\' (mahabhishava) from which the\nAntaryama and following libations are obtained is performed by the four\npriests, viz. the Adhvaryu and his three assistants, Pratiprasthat _ri_ , Nesh\n_t_ _ri_ and Unnet _ri_ , each having an equal portion of Soma-plants and one\nof the four remaining pressing-stones assigned to him. The ceremonies\nmentioned in [III, 9, 4, 1](sbe2639.htm#3:9:4:1) seq. are repeated on the\npresent occasion, each of the priests tying a piece of gold to his ring-\nfinger. The pressing is performed in three rounds of three turns each, the\nnumber of single strokes of the several turns p. 257 being, however, not\nlimited, as was the case at the pressing of the Upa _m_ _s_ u. Only before the\nfirst turn of each round Nigrabhya water is poured on the plants. After each\nturn the scattered plants are gathered together on a heap. At the end of each\nround (of three turns) the Soma is touched (or \'strengthened\'); whereupon the\ncompletely pressed-out stalks are thrown into the Hot _ri_ \'s cup and the\nNigrabha formula is pronounced ([III, 9, 4, 21](sbe2639.htm#3:9:4:21)). The\nstalks which are still juicy are then \'gathered together\' (see [III, 9, 4,\n19](sbe2639.htm#3:9:4:19)) into the so-called sambhara _n_ i and poured into\nthe \xc3\x82dhavaniya trough, and having been stirred about therein by the Unnet _ri_\n, are taken out, pressed out, and thrown on the skin, when the same process is\nrepeated. On the completion of the third round the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a is\nbrought forward (from behind the axle of the southern cart) by the Udgat _ri_\ns (for the mantras used by them see Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. I, 2, 6-7) and placed on\nthe four stones covered with the pressed-out Soma husks, the straining-cloth\nbeing then stretched over it, with the fringe towards the north. The Hot _ri_\n\'s cup (held by the sacrificer and containing the remaining Nigrabhya water)\nhaving then been filled up by the Unnet _ri_ with the Soma-juice in the\n\xc3\x82dhavaniya trough, the sacrificer pours it in one continuous stream from the\nHot _ri_ \'s cup upon the straining-cloth, spread over the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a\nby the chanters (Udgat _ri_ s), muttering a mantra (Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. I, 2, 9)\nall the time. From this stream the first eight (at the midday pressing the\nfirst five) libations are taken, by the respective cups being held under, the\nremaining libations or cups being drawn either from the strained (or \'pure,\'\n_s_ ukra) Soma-juice in the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a, or from the \xc3\x82graya _n_\nasthali or the Putabh _ri_ t. Saya _n_ a on Ait. Br. II, 22, 1 seems to\nexclude the Antaryama graha from the \'great pressing:\' antaryamagrahahomad\nurdhvam mahabhishava _m_ k _ri_ tva. Also in II, 21, 1 he mentions the Dadhi\ngraha, A _m_ _s_ u graha, and Adabhya graha (see [p.\n255](sbe2640.htm#page_255), n. [2](sbe2640.htm#fn_618)) as intervening between\nthe Aponaptriya ceremony and the drawing of the Upa _m_ _s_ u graha.\n\n[258:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_622) Anta _h_ pavitrat, lit. from (the vessel or stream\nof Soma) which has the strainer inside it; the straining-cloth being spread\nover the Dro _n_ akala _s_ a, into which the pressed-out Soma-juice is poured.\nThe Petersburg Dictionary assigns to it the meaning \'the Soma within the\nfiltering vessel\' (see [IV, 1, 1, 3](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:3)). Perhaps it means\n\'from that which has a strainer between,\' i.e. from the poured-out stream from\nwhich the libation is taken, and which is separated from the Dro _n_ akala _s_\na by the straining-cloth.\n\n[259:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_623) The term Upayama, lit. \'foundation, substratum,\'\nreferring properly to \'that which is held under\' while taking the libation,\nthat is, the cup of the respective graha (and hence also identified with the\nearth, as the substratum of everything, cf. Say. on Taitt. S. I, 4, 3), has\ncome to be applied likewise to the formula \'upayamag _ri_ hito \'si,\' i.e.\n\'thou art taken with (or on) a support,\' which is repeated at those libations\nbefore the formulas muttered while they are drawn into the respective vessels\nor cups (see [par. 15](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:15)). Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 118\nnote, makes the following distinction between the graha (cup) and patra\n(vessel) of the Antaryama (and Upa _m_ _s_ u) libation: \'The patra is a vessel\nresembling a large wooden jar with but a very slight cavity on the top, in\nwhich the Soma-juice is filled. The graha is a small cup, like a saucer, made\nof earth, and put over the cavity of the Soma vessel, in order to cover the\n"precious" juice. The bottom of it is first put in water, and a gold leaf\nplaced beneath it. There are as many grahas as there are patras; they belong\ntogether just as cup and saucer, and are regarded as inseparable. The word\ngraha is, however, taken often in the sense of the whole, meaning both graha\nand patra.\' I doubt, however, whether this distinction is in accordance with\nthe old authorities. The graha vessels or cups are described as resembling the\nshape of a mortar. For other peculiarities, see [IV, I, 5,\n19](sbe2644.htm#4:1:5:19). With some libations there is both a patra (cup) and\na sthali (bowl).\n\n[259:2](sbe2641.htm#fr_624) See [III, 2, 3, 1](sbe2609.htm#3:2:3:1) seq.\n\n[260:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_625) Lit. forms the support or basis for it. The\nsentence could also be translated, \'this earth doubtless is an upayama\n(support), since she bears food.\' Apparently he means to say that, as the gods\nare above, the food to he offered to them requires some support, something to\n\'hold it up\' by for the gods to reach it.\n\n[260:2](sbe2641.htm#fr_626) This refers to the formula \'This is thy womb,\'\nwith which most libations, after being drawn, are deposited in their proper\nplace on the khara until they are used for offering. See [IV, 1, 3,\n19](sbe2642.htm#4:1:3:19).\n\n[261:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_627) \'Were he to offer both after sunrise, there would\nonly be day, and no night; and were he to offer both before sunrise, there\nwould only be night, and no day.\' Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[261:2](sbe2641.htm#fr_628) Tasmad y ida _m_ ratrau tamasi sati nir _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nayata iva ki _m_ _k_ id iva. Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[261:3](sbe2641.htm#fr_629) Viz. from the stream of Soma poured from the Hot\n_ri_ \'s cup on the straining-cloth. See [p. 256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note\n1.\n\n[261:4](sbe2641.htm#fr_630) See [paragraph 6](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:6), with note.\n\n[262:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_631) Mahidhara offers the alternative interpretation,\n\'through thee I place day and night between (Soma and the enemies),\' which is\nalso Saya _n_ a\'s interpretation on Taitt. S. I, 4, 3; as apparently that of\nthe Taitt. S. itself, VI, 4, 6.\n\n[262:2](sbe2641.htm#fr_632) See [IV, 1, 1,\n17](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:17)-[18](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:18).\n\n[263:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_633) This does not appear to refer to the Taittiriyas,\nsince by them the same order of proceeding is prescribed for the Antaryama as\nfor the Upa _m_ _s_ u ([p. 252](sbe2640.htm#page_252), note\n[2](sbe2640.htm#fn_608)); cf. Saya _n_ a on Taitt. S. I, p. 603. See, however,\nMaitray. Sa _m_ h. I, 3, 4-5.\n\n[263:2](sbe2641.htm#fr_634) \'Apid (vai)\' seems to have much the same meaning\n(\'perhaps\') as the later \'api nama.\' Cf. I, 9, 1, 19.\n\n[263:3](sbe2641.htm#fr_635) He offers the entire Soma in the Antaryama cup,\nwithout leaving any, or pouring any juice into the \xc3\x82graya _n_ asthali.\n\n[264:1](sbe2641.htm#fr_636) According to the Ka _n_ va text he is to place the\nAntaryama cup on the south-east corner (dakshi _n_ ardhe) of the khara (see\n[p. 255](sbe2640.htm#page_255), n. [2](sbe2640.htm#fn_618)); while, according\nto Katy. IX, 2, I, both the Upa _m_ _s_ u and Antaryama are to be placed on\nthe north-east corner, the former south of the latter. This arrangement,\nhowever, would scarcely agree with [IV, I, 1,\n27](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:27)-[28](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:28). The Upa _m_ _s_ u-savana\nstone, doubtless, is to lie between the two cups, with its face towards the\nUpa _m_ _s_ u.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 3. Third Brahma _n_ a](sbe2642.htm)\n\n'
