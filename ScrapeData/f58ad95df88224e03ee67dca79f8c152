To the east (is placed) the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, to the west the mess of cooked food.\n\n2. 2 Having sprinkled (water) round (the fire) and poured \xc3\x82 _g_ ya on the mess of cooked food, he begins to sacrifice simply with the pot-ladle, picking out portions of the sacrificial food (without 'underspreading' and pouring \xc3\x82 _g_ ya over the Havis).\n\n3. 3 If he intends, however, to sacrifice so as to 'underspread' (the Havis with \xc3\x82 _g_ ya) and to pour (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) over it, let him sacrifice first the two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya portions (in the following way):\n\n4\\. He should take four portions of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya\xc2\x97five portions (are taken) by the\nBh _ri_ gus\xc2\x97and should sacrifice from west to east, on the northern side with\n(the formula), 'To Agni Svaha!' on the southern side with (the words), 'To\nSoma Svaha!'\n\n5\\. He then cuts off (two or three Avadanas) from the Havis, having 'spread\nunder' (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya).\n\n6. 6 (Two Avadanas) from the middle and from the east side, if he (belongs to the families who) make\n\np. 35\n\nfour Avadanas. (Three Avadanas) from the middle, from the east and from the\nwest side, if (he belongs to those who) make five Avadanas.\n\n7. 7 He sprinkles (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on the cut-off portions.\n\n8\\. He anoints the places from which he has cut them off (with \xc3\x82 _g_ ya) in\norder that the strength (of the Havis) may not be lost.\n\n9\\. He should sacrifice over the middle of the fire with (the words), 'To Agni\nSvaha!'\xc2\x97\n\n10\\. Once or thrice, in that same way.\n\n11. 11 Now for the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (oblation), after having 'spread under' (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya), he cuts off once a very big (Avadana) from the eastern part of the northern part (of the Havis), Twice he should sprinkle (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on it.\n\n12\\. But if he (belongs to the families who) make five Avadanas, he should\n'spread under' twice, and cut off (the Avadana), and sprinkle (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on it\ntwice.\n\n13. 13 He does not anoint the place from which he has cut off, in order that the strength (of the Havis) may be lost.\n\n14. 14 With the words, 'To Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t\n\np. 36\n\n[paragraph continues] Svaha!' he should sacrifice it over the eastern part of\nthe northern part (of the fire).\n\n15. 15 He should sacrifice oblations of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya on (the chief oblations of cooked sacrificial food), with the Mahavyah _ri_ tis.\n\n16. 16 The insertion (stands) before the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (oblation).\n\n17\\. If different sacrifices are performed together, there is only one\nsweeping (of the ground) round (the fire) (chap. 3, 1), one (putting of) fuel\n(on the fire) (chap. 7, 19), one Barhis, one sprinkling (of water) round (the\nfire) (chap. 8, 2), one \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, and one offering of the two \xc3\x82 _g_ yabhagas\n(chap. 8, 3).\n\n18\\. Having cut off (the Avadanas) for all (the single sacrifices), he\nsacrifices the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t oblation only once.\n\n19. 19 After he has sacrificed, he should throw that pot-ladle (which he has used in the preceding ceremonies) into the fire.\n\n20\\. Or having washed it, he should take with it (the rest of the sacrificial\nfood), and should eat that.\n\np. 37\n\n21\\. The Sruva he should not throw into the fire, say some (teachers).\n\n22. 22 By one who has not set up the sacred fires, the mess of cooked food should be offered to Agni at the festivals both of the full and of the new moon.\n\n23\\. To Agni, or to Agni and Soma, by one who has set them up, at the full-\nmoon (sacrifice);\n\n24\\. To Indra, or to Indra and Agni, or to Mahendra, at the new-moon\n(sacrifice).\n\n25\\. Or also one who has set up the sacred fires, should offer it to Agni at\nthe festivals both of the full and of the new moon.\n\n26. 26 Having put a piece of wood (on the fire), and having afterwards sprinkled (water) round (the fire), he performs the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avastu ceremony (in the following way):\n\n27. 27 From that same Barhis he should take a handful of Kura grass, and should dip it thrice into the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya or into the Havis, the points, the middle, and the roots, with (the words), 'May the birds come, licking what has been anointed.'\n\n28\\. He then should besprinkle that (handful of grass) with water, and should\nthrow it into the fire with (the verse), 'Thou who art the lord of cattle,\nRudra, who walkest with the lines (of cattle), the manly one: do no harm to\nour cattle; let this be offered to thee! Svaha!\n\n29\\. This (ceremony) they call Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avastu.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[34:2](sbe30011.htm#fr_158) 8, 2.

The comparison of Baudhayana 1, 17, 23,\natraitan meksha _n_ am ahavanive\xe0\xa4\xbdnupraharati (Hillebrandt, p. 119, note 3),\nshows that the commentary is wrong, and that etad belongs to meksha _n_ am.\n\n[37:22](sbe30011.htm#fr_168) 22-25.
