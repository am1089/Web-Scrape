We offer these prayers [1](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:1:1) to Rudra, the strong,\nwhose hair is braided [2](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:1:2), who rules over heroes\n[3](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:1:3), that he may be a blessing to man and beast,\nthat everything in this our village may be prosperous and free from disease.\n\n2\\. Be gracious to us, O Rudra, and give us joy, and we shall honour thee, the\nruler of heroes, with worship. What health and wealth father Manu acquired by\nhis sacrifices, may we obtain the same, O Rudra, under thy guidance.\n\n3\\. O bounteous Rudra, may we by sacrifice obtain the goodwill of thee, the\nruler of heroes; come to our clans, well-disposed, and, with unharmed men, we\nshall offer our libation to thee.\n\n4\\. We call down for our help the fierce Rudra, who fulfils our sacrifice, the\nswift, the wise; may he drive far away from us the anger of the gods; we\ndesire his goodwill only.\n\n5\\. We call down with worship the red boar of the sky, the god with braided\nhair, the blazing form; may he who carries in his hand the best medicines\ngrant us protection, shield, and shelter!\n\n6\\. This speech is spoken for the father of the Maruts, sweeter than sweet, a\njoy [1](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:6:1) to Rudra; grant to us also, O immortal, the\nfood of mortals, be gracious to us and to our kith and kin!\n\n7\\. Do not slay our great or our small ones, our\n\np. 423\n\ngrowing or our grown ones, our father or our mother and do not hurt our own\n[1](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:7:1) bodies, O Rudra!\n\n8\\. O Rudra, hurt us not in our kith and kin, nor in our own life, not in our\ncows, nor in our horses! Do not slay our men in thy wrath: carrying libations,\nwe call on thee always.\n\n9\\. Like a shepherd [1](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:9:1), I have driven these praises\nnear to thee; O father of the Maruts, grant us thy favour! For thy goodwill is\nauspicious, and most gracious, hence we desire thy protection alone.\n\n10\\. Let thy cow-slaying and thy man-slaying be far away\n[1](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:10:1), and let thy favour be with us, O ruler of\nheroes! Be gracious to us, and bless us, O god, and then give us twofold\nprotection [2](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:10:2).\n\n11\\. We have uttered our supplication to him, desiring his help; may Rudra\nwith the Maruts hear our call. May Mitra, Varu _n_ a, Aditi, the River, Earth,\nand the Sky grant us this!\n\np. 424\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Kutsa \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa. Metre, 1-9 _G_ agati; 10, 11 Trish _t_ ubh. Verse\n1 = VS. XVI, 48; TS. IV, 5, 10, 1; MS. II, 9, 9 (yatha na _h_ _s_ am); verse 2\n= TS. IV, 5, 10, 2; verse 7 = VS. XVI, 15; TS. IV, 5, 10, 2; verse 8 = VS.\nXVI, 16; TS. III, 4, 11, 2; IV, 5, 10, 3; MS. IV, 12, 6 (a\xc2\xb4yushi; havishmanto\nnamasa vidhema te); verse 10 = TS. IV, 5, 10, 3.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. TS. reads ima\xc2\xb4m matim, and yatha na _h_ _s_ am.\n\nNote 2. Kapardin is an epithet not only of Rudra, but also of Pushan (VI, 55,\n2; IX, 67, II), and of a Vedic clan, the T _ri_ tsus (VII, 83, 8) or Vasish\n_th_ as; see Roth, Zur Literatur and Geschichte des Weda, pp. 94 seq.;\nOldenberg, Z. D. M. G. XLII, p. 207. Kaparda is the name of a shell, and the\nhair twisted together in the form of a shell seems to have suggested the name\nof kapardin.\n\nNote 3. Kshayad-vira means 'ruling over heroes,' just as mandad-vira (VIII,\n69, 1) means 'delighting heroes.' This meaning is applicable to all passages\nwhere kshayad-vira occurs, and there is no reason why we should translate it\nby 'destroyer of heroes,' which can hardly be considered as an epitheton\nornans. No doubt, a god who rules and protects can also be conceived as\npunishing and destroying, and this is particularly the case with Rudra. Hence\nin certain passages Rudra may well be invoked as n _ri_ han (IV 3, 6), just as\nwe read of the Maruts (VII, 56, 17): 'May that bolt of yours which kills\ncattle and men be far from us! Incline to us, O Vasu, with your favours!' See\nMuir, S _T_. IV, p. 301, note.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nTS. reads aya _g_ e and pra _n_ itau. See Ludwig, Notes, p. 265.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. On the meaning of vardhana and v _ri_ dh in Zend, see Darmesteter,\nOrmazd, pp. 41, 6; 92, 1.\n\np. 425\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. TS. reads priya\xc2\xb4 ma\xc2\xb4 nas tanuva _h_ rudra ririsha _h_. Priya, dear,\nused like \xcf\x86\xce\xaf\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, in the sense of our own. See Bergaigne, III, 152.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nSee Colebrooke, Misc. Ess. I, p. 141 (ed. 1837); and _S_ veta _s_ vat. Up. in\nS. B. E. XV, p. 254, note. \xc3\x82\xc2\xb4yushi for ayau is supported by VS. and TS. I\npropose to read a\xc2\xb4yau for ayau. Bhamita _h_ is supported by TS. and _S_ vet.\nUp., while VS. reads bhamina _h_ , which Mahidhara refers to vira\xc2\xb4n. The last\nline is the same in RV. and VS., but the TS. reads havishmanto namasa vidhema\nte, while the _S_ vet. Up. reads havishmanta _h_ sadasi tva havamahe.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. As to the simile, see RV. X, 127, 8, and Muir S _T_. IV, p. 304, note.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. TS. reads drat te, goghna (\xc2\xb0e), purushaghne, kshayadviraya, raksha for\nm _ri_ _l_ a\xc2\xb4, deva bruhi.\n\nNote 2. I take dvibarha _h_ , which stands for dvibarha _h_ , as an adjective\nto _s_ arma, or possibly as an adverb, see Lanman, p. 560. It can hardly refer\nto Rudra, as Grassmann supposes. See J. Schmidt, Pluralbildungen der Neutra,\npp. 132 seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 33. To Rudra, the Father of the Maruts (the Storm-\ngods)](sbe3257.htm)\n\n"
