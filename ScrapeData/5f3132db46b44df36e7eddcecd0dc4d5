Ether 1 (does) not (originate), on account of the absence of scriptural\nstatement.\n\nIn the Vedanta-texts we meet in different places with different statements\nconcerning the origination of various things. Some of those passages declare\nthat ether originated; some do not. Some record the origination of air; others\ndo not. Other passages again make analogous statements concerning the\nindividual soul and the vital airs.--Similarly we observe that other\nscriptural texts contradict one another concerning order of succession and the\nlike.--Now, as we ourselves have inferred the worthlessness of other\nphilosophical doctrines from their mutual contradictions, a suspicion might\narise that our doctrine is equally worthless, owing to its intrinsic\ncontradictions. Hence a new discussion is begun in order to clear from all\ndoubt the sense of all those Vedanta-texts which refer to creation, and thus\nto remove the suspicion alluded to.\n\nHere we have to consider in the first place the question\n\np. 4\n\nwhether ether has an origin or not.--The purvapakshin maintains that ether\ndoes not originate, since there is no scriptural statement to that effect. For\nin the chapter which treats of the origin (of the world) ether is not\nmentioned at all. In the passage 'In the beginning there was that only which\nis, one only, without a second' the _Kh_ andogya at first introduces Brahman\nas the general subject-matter, by means of the clause 'that which is,' and\nthereupon (in the passages 'It thought,' 'It sent forth fire,' &c.) records\nthe origin of three elements, viz. fire, water, and earth; giving the first\nplace to fire which (ordinarily) occupies the middle place among the five\nelements. 1 Now, as scriptural statement is our (only) authority in the\norigination of the knowledge of supersensuous things, and as there is no\nscriptural statement declaring the origin of ether, ether must be considered\nto have no origin.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[3:1](sbe38002.htm#fr_0) Here, as generally in the preceding parts of this\ntranslation, aka _s_ a is rendered by 'ether.' There is no doubt that\noccasionally the appropriate--and in some cases the only possible-rendering is\nnot 'ether' but 'space;' but the former rendering, after all, best agrees with\nthe general Vedantic view of aka _s_ a. The Vedantins do not clearly\ndistinguish between empty space and an exceedingly line matter filling all\nspace, and thus it happens that in many cases where we speak of the former\nthey speak of aka _s_ a, i.e. the all-pervading substratum of sound; which\nhowsoever attenuated is yet one of the material elements, and as such belongs\nto the same category as air, fire, water, and earth.\n\n[4:1](sbe38002.htm#fr_1) The usual order being ether, air, fire, water, earth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 2](sbe38003.htm)\n\n"
