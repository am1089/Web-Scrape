PR\xc3\x82TAR-ANUV\xc3\x82KA (MORNING-PRAYER) AND PREPARATORY CEREMONIES.\n\n3:9:3:11\\. They (the priests) are wakened (towards morning). Having touched\nwater 2, they proceed together to the \xc3\x82gnidhra (fire-house) and take the\nportions of ghee (for the Savaniya animal offerings). Having taken the\nportions of ghee, they betake themselves (to the high altar). When they have\ndeposited the ghee,--\n\np. 227\n\n3:9:3:22\\. He (the Adhvaryu) takes down the king (Soma) 1. Now this (earth) is\na safe resting-place, and the birth-place of living beings; it is to this safe\nresting-place that he now takes him down; he spreads him thereon, produces him\ntherefrom.\n\n3:9:3:33\\. He takes him down between the shafts; for the cart is (a means of)\nthe sacrifice, and thus alone he does not put him outside the sacrifice. He\nputs him on the pressing stones lying there with their heads (mukha, mouths) 2\ntowards each other; for Soma is the nobility, and the stones are the clans\n(people); he thereby raises the nobility over the clan. And as to why they are\nlying with their heads together,--he thereby makes the clan of one head (or\nmouth) with, and uncontentious towards, the nobles; therefore they are lying\nwith their heads towards each other.\n\n3:9:3:44\\. He takes (Soma) down, with (Va _g_. S. VI, 25), 'Thee for the\nheart, thee for the mind!' This he says for the (accomplishment of the)\nsacrificer's wish, since it is with the heart and mind that the sacrificer\nentertains the wish for which he sacrifices; therefore he says, 'Thee for the\nheart, thee for the mind!'\n\n3:9:3:55\\. 'Thee for the sky, thee for the sun!' This, on the other hand, he\nsays with a view to the world of the gods. When he says, 'Thee for the sky,\nthee\n\np. 228\n\nfor the sun,' he means to say, 'Thee for the gods!' 'Upwards convey thou to\nthe sky, to the gods, this cult, these invocations!' Cult, doubtless, means\nsacrifice: he thereby means to say, 'Upwards carry thou this sacrifice to the\nsky, to the gods!'\n\n3:9:3:66\\. [Va _g_. S. VI, 26], 'O Soma, king, descend unto all thy people!'\nwhereby he brings him down for the lordship, for the sovereignty of these\npeople (creatures).\n\n3:9:3:77\\. Having quitted his hold (of Soma) he sits down by him, with, 'May\nall thy people descend to thee.' Now, in saying, 'Descend unto all thy\npeople,' he does what is unseemly, for Soma being the nobility, he thereby, as\nit were, confounds good and bad 1,--and, indeed, in consequence thereof,\npeople now confound good and bad. But in this (formula) he does what is right\nand according to order,--in saying, 'May all thy people descend to thee,' he\nmakes all his subjects go down (on their knees) before him; and hence when a\nnoble approaches, all these subjects, the people, go down before him, crouch\ndown by him on the ground 2. Sitting near (Soma), the Hot _ri_ is about to\nrecite the morning-prayer.\n\n3:9:3:88\\. Then, while putting a kindling-stick (on the fire), he (the\nAdhvaryu) says, 'Recite to the gods\n\np. 229\n\nthe early-coming!' Now the early-coming gods are the metres, as the after-\nofferings are the metres; and the after-offerings are performed with, 'Prompt\n(the Hot _ri_ to recite) to the gods! Recite (the offering-prayer) to the\ngods!'\n\n3:9:3:99\\. And so some say, 'Recite to the gods 1!' But let him not say so;\nfor the early-coming gods are the metres, as the after-offerings are the\nmetres, and the after-offerings are performed with, 'Prompt--to the gods!\nRecite (the offering-prayer) to the gods!' therefore let him say, 'Recite to\nthe gods, the early-coming!'\n\n3:9:3:1010\\. And when he puts on a kindling-stick, it is the metres he thereby\nkindles. And when the Hot _ri_ recites the morning-prayer 2, he thereby\n\np. 230\n\nagain strengthens the metres, makes them to be of unimpaired vigour; for the\nmetres had their vigour impaired by the gods, since it was through the metres\nthat the gods reached the heavenly worlds; they neither sing praises (chants)\nnor recite ( _s_ astras) here. Hereby he now again strengthens the metres and\nmakes them to be of unimpaired vigour; and by means of them, thus unimpaired\nin vigour, they\n\np. 231\n\nperform the sacrifice; this is why the Hot _ri_ recites the morning-prayer.\n\n3:9:3:1111\\. Here now they say, 'What is the (Adhvaryu's) response to the\nmorning-prayer 1?' The Adhvaryu should wait through (the prayer) waking, and\nwhen he blinks, this is his response. But let him not do this; if he fall\nasleep (again) he may as well sleep. When the Hot _ri_ brings his morning-\nprayer to a close 2,--there is an offering-spoon called Pra _k_ ara _n_ i,--\nhaving therein taken ghee in four ladlings, he (the Adhvaryu) offers it.\n\n3:9:3:1212\\. For when the head of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a (the sacrifice) was struck off,\nhis sap, running, entered the waters; that (sap) he fetched yesterday with the\nVasativari water; and he now goes for what sap of the sacrifice remains\ntherein.\n\n3:9:3:1313\\. And when he offers that offering, he pours out (the ghee) towards\nthat same sap of the sacrifice (in the water) and draws it to him. And,\nindeed, he pleases those deities to whom he offers that offering, and thus\nsatisfied and pleased, they fit that sap of the sacrifice together 3 for him.\n\n3:9:3:1414\\. He offers with, 'May Agni, with his flame, hear my prayer;'\nwhereby he means to say, 'May he hear this prayer of mine, may he vouchsafe it\nto me;'--'May the waters and the Soma-bowls hear, the divine!' whereby he\nmeans to say, 'May the waters hear this (prayer) of mine, may they vouchsafe\nit to me.'--'Hear me, ye stones,\n\np. 232\n\nas knowing the sacrifice!' whereby he means to say, 'May the (pressing) stones\nhear this (prayer) of mine, may they vouchsafe it to me;' and 'as knowing the\nsacrifice,' he says, because the stones are indeed knowing 1. 'May the divine\nSavit _ri_ hear my prayer, Hail!' whereby he means to say, 'May the divine\nSavit _ri_ hear this (prayer) of mine, may he vouchsafe it to me;' for Savit\n_ri_ is the impeller of the gods; impelled by him he goes for that sap of the\nsacrifice.\n\n3:9:3:1515\\. Having then a second time taken ghee by four ladlings, he says,\nwhile going forth towards the north, 'Summon the waters!' whereby he means to\nsay, 'Desire the waters, O Hotar!' The reason why the Hot _ri_ then recites 2\nis this: by that\n\np. 233\n\n[paragraph continues] (oblation) he (the Adhvaryu) pours out (the ghee)\ntowards that sap of the sacrifice (in the water), and draws it to him; and he\n(the Hot _ri_ ) then stands by those (Ekadhana pitchers) lest the evil spirits\nshould injure them on the way.\n\n3:9:3:1616\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then gives directions, 'Come hither, cup-bearer\nof the Maitravaru _n_ a! Nesh _t_ ar, lead up the wives! Ye bearers of the\nEkadhana (cups), come hither! Agnidh, step ever against the pit with the\nVasativari water and the Hot _ri_ 's cup!' this is a composite direction.\n\n3:9:3:1717\\. They walk northwards out (of the sacrificial ground)--by the back\nof the pit and the front side of the \xc3\x82gnidhra; whereupon they proceed in the\ndirection in which the water is. They go thither together with the wives. The\nreason why they go thither with the wives is this.\n\n3:9:3:1818\\. When the head of the sacrifice was struck off, its sap, running,\nentered the waters; those Gandharva Soma-wardens watched it.\n\n3:9:3:1919\\. The gods then said, 'Those Gandharvas, surely, are a great danger\nto us here, how can we carry off the sap of the sacrifice to a place free from\ndanger and injury?'\n\n3:9:3:2020\\. They said, 'Well, the Gandharvas are fond of women; let us go\ntogether with the wives! The Gandharvas, surely, will hanker after the wives,\nand we shall carry off that sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger\nand injury.'\n\n3:9:3:2121\\. They went with the wives; the Gandharvas did indeed hanker after\nthe wives, and they (the\n\np. 234\n\ngods) carried off that sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and\ninjury.\n\n3:9:3:2222\\. And so does that (Adhvaryu) now go (to the water) with the wives;\nthe Gandharvas hanker after the wives, and he carries off that sap of the\nsacrifice to a place free from danger and injury.\n\n3:9:3:2323\\. He offers (the ghee) upon the water; for that sap of the\nsacrifice, indeed, draws near to that oblation, when offered; it rises (to the\nsurface) to meet it; and having thus brought it to light, he seizes it.\n\n3:9:3:2424\\. And again why he offers this oblation: he thereby pours out\n(ghee) towards that sap of the sacrifice, and draws it to him, and craves it\nof the waters. And, indeed, he pleases those deities to whom he offers that\noblation, and thus satisfied and pleased they fit that sap of the sacrifice\ntogether for him.\n\n3:9:3:2525\\. He offers with (Va _g_. S. VI, 27), 'Ye divine waters,--the son\nof waters;' the waters are indeed divine, hence he says, 'Ye divine waters,--\nthe son of waters;' 'That wave of yours, suitable for offering;' whereby he\nmeans to say, 'That wave of yours which is suitable for the sacrifice;'\n'Mighty, most grateful;' by 'mighty' he means to say 'powerful,' and by 'most\ngrateful' he means to say 'most sweet;' 'Give ye that unto those gods among\nthe gods,' in saying this he has craved it of them; 'The drinkers of the pure\n(Soma);' the pure, doubtless, is the truth; in saying, 'the drinkers (pa) of\nthe pure,' he means to say, 'the defenders (pa) of the truth;' 'Whose portion\nye are, Hail!' for this indeed is their portion.\n\n3:9:3:2626\\. Thereupon he makes that oblation (ghee) float away by means of\nthe Maitravaru _n_ a's cup, with (Va _g_. S. VI, 28), 'Thou art furrowing!'\nEven\n\np. 235\n\nas a coal is consumed by Fire, so is that oblation consumed by that deity. Now\nthat water, which is in the Maitravaru _n_ a's cup, he will have to pour on\nthe king (Soma); and ghee being a thunderbolt, and Soma seed, he makes (the\nghee) float away lest he should injure that seed, Soma, by that thunderbolt,\nthe ghee.\n\n3:9:3:2727\\. He then takes (water) with, 'I draw thee up for the\nimperishableness of the ocean;' for the ocean is water; he thus confers\nimperishableness upon the waters; wherefore, in spite of so much food (and\ndrink) being consumed, the waters are not diminished. Thereupon they draw\n(water in) the Ekadhana pitchers, and thereupon the vessels for washing the\nfeet 1.\n\n3:9:3:2828\\. The reason why he takes (water) with the Maitravaru _n_ a's cup\nis this. When the sacrifice escaped from the gods, the gods endeavoured to\ncall it up by means of (sacrificial) calls (praisha) 2; by means of the puroru\n_k_ ('shining before') formulas 3 they pleased it (pra-ro _k_ aya), and by the\nnivids they made (their wishes) known (ni-vid) to it. Therefore he takes\n(water) with the Maitravaru _n_ a's cup.\n\n3:9:3:2929\\. They come back. The Agnidh takes up his position opposite to the\npit with the Vasativari water and the Hot _ri_ 's cup. Close over the pit he\n\np. 236\n\n[paragraph continues] (the Adhvaryu) makes the Vasativari water and the\nMaitravaru _n_ a's cup touch one another, with, 'Water hath united with water,\nplants with plants!' the sap of the sacrifice which was fetched yesterday and\nthat fetched to-day, both kinds he thereby mixes together.\n\n3:9:3:3030\\. Now some indeed pour (some of) the Vasativari water into the\nMaitravaru _n_ a's cup, and from the Maitravaru _n_ a's cup (back) to the\nVasativari water, arguing, 'Thereby we mix together both the sap of the\nsacrifice which was fetched yesterday and that fetched to-day.' But let him\nnot do this; for when he pours (the water) together into the \xc3\x82dhavaniya trough\n1, then both kinds of sap are mixed together. Thereupon he pours the\nVasativari water into the Hot _ri_ 's cup for the Nigrabhyas 2. And as to why\nhe makes them touch one another close over the pit, it was from thence,\nforsooth, that the gods rose to heaven; he thus makes the sacrificer look\nalong the road to heaven.\n\n3:9:3:3131\\. They return (to the Havirdhana). The Hot _ri_ asks him,\n'Adhvaryu, hast thou gained the waters?' whereby he means to say, 'Hast thou\nobtained the waters?' He replies to him, 'Yea, they have yielded themselves!'\nwhereby he means to say, 'I have obtained them and they have yielded to me.'\n\n3:9:3:3232\\. And if it be an Agnish _t_ oma, and there be left a residue (of\nghee poured together) in the pra _k_ ara _n_ i\n\np. 237\n\nspoon sufficient for an oblation, let him offer that. But if it be not\nsufficient for an oblation, he takes another portion of ghee in four ladlings\nand offers it, with (Va _g_. S. VI, 29; Rig-veda I, 27, 7), 'Whatever mortal\nthou favourest in battles, whomsoever thou speedest in the race, he winneth\nunfailing strength, Hail!' He offers with (a prayer) to Agni, because the\nAgnish _t_ oma ('Agni's praise') means Agni; thus he establishes the Agnish\n_t_ oma in Agni. [He offers] with (a verse) containing the word 'mortal,'\nbecause the Agnish _t_ oma is of the same measure as man. Let hire then offer\nin this manner, if it be an Agnish _t_ oma.\n\n3:9:3:3333\\. And if it be an Ukthya, let him touch the middle enclosing-stick,\n--there are three enclosing-sticks and three recitations (uktha) 1; and by\nmeans of them the sacrifice is there established. And if it be either an\nAtiratra or a Sho _d_ a _s_ in 2, let him neither make an oblation nor touch\nthe middle enclosing-stick; having merely muttered (the above verse), let him\nsilently betake himself (to the Havirdhana) and enter it 3. In this way he\nduly distinguishes the forms of sacrifice from one another.\n\n3:9:3:3434\\. The Ekadhana pitchers are always of uneven number,--either three,\nor five, or seven, or nine, or eleven, or thirteen, or fifteen 4. Now two and\ntwo\n\np. 238\n\n[paragraph continues] (an even number) means a productive pair; and the one\nthat remains over, remains over for the sacrificer's prosperity. And,\nmoreover, that which remains over for the sacrificer's prosperity is the\ncommon property (sa-dhana) of these (others); and because it is the common\nproperty of these, therefore they are called Ekadhana (having one as their\ncommon property).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[226:2](sbe2638.htm#fr_567) After performing their ablutions they have to\nperform the preliminary work and ceremonies, such as preparing the Garhapatya,\nfetching and arranging the vessels, cleaning of spoons, &c. up to the\ndepositing of the ghee, near the high altar.\n\n[227:1](sbe2638.htm#fr_568) According to Katy. VIII, 9, 24-25, on the previous\nevening,--immediately after the carrying round And depositing of the\nVasativari water,--the Soma is placed on a seat (asandi) in the \xc3\x82gnidhra fire\nhouse, where the sacrificer has to watch over it during that night. This is\nnot mentioned in the Brahma _n_ a, and from what follows it would rather seem\nthat the Soma is taken down from the cart (see III, 6, 3, 17 seq.). Otherwise\nwe might translate, 'He brings him down (from the \xc3\x82gnidhra).'\n\n[227:2](sbe2638.htm#fr_569) That is, with their broad sides turned towards\neach other.\n\n[228:1](sbe2638.htm#fr_570) 'He commits a papavasyasa _m_ ,' i.e. according to\nHaug, Ait. Br. p. 413, 'a breach of the oath of allegiance,' (where Saya _n_ a\nexplains it by 'exceedingly bad'); or 'an (act of) perversity,' Weber, Ind.\nStud. IX, p. 300. Saya _n_ a, to our passage, explains it by 'mixing the bad\nwith the good (or better).' The literal translation is 'a bad-bettering.' What\nis chiefly implied in the term is evidently the showing of disrespect by an\ninferior to a superior person.\n\n[228:2](sbe2638.htm#fr_571) Tasmat kshatriyam upary asinam adhastad vi _s_ a\nima _h_ pra _g_ a upasate. Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[229:1](sbe2638.htm#fr_572) Here now, some say only, 'Recite to the early-\ncoming!' not 'to the . . . gods!' but let him not say this. Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[229:2](sbe2638.htm#fr_573) The Pratar-anuvaka, or morning-prayer (matin\nchant), has to be recited by the Hot _ri_ in the latter part of the night\nbefore any sound (of birds, &c.) is to be heard. It may begin immediately\nafter midnight, and conclude as soon as daylight appears. When called upon by\nthe Adhvaryu to recite the morning-prayer, the Hot _ri_ first makes an\noblation of ghee on the \xc3\x82gnidhra fire, with the mantra, 'Protect me from the\nspell of the mouth, from every imprecation, Hail!' and then two oblations on\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya with appropriate mantras. Thereupon he betakes himself to the\nHavirdhana (cart-shed), in entering which, by the east door, he touches\nsuccessively the front-wreath (rara _t_ a, cf. [III, 5, 3,\n9](sbe2621.htm#3:5:3:9)) and the doorposts, with formulas. He then squats down\nbetween the yoke-pieces of the two Soma-carts, and begins his recitation with\nRig-veda X, 30, 12, 'Ye, O wealthy waters, verily possess good things; ye\nconfer desirable energy and immortality; ye command riches with abundant\noffspring: may Sarasvati (the river S., and Speech) bestow on the bard that\nvital vigour!' The 'early-coming' deities to whom the recitation is\nsuccessively addressed, are Agni, Ushas (the dawn), and the two A _s_ vins\n(the precursors of the sun); the prayer thus consisting of three sections,\ntermed kratu (Agnikratu p. 230, &c.). The hymns and detached verses making up\nthese sections are arranged according to the seven metres (thus forming seven\nsub-sections of each), viz. gayatri, anush _t_ ubh, trish _t_ ubh, b _ri_\nhati, ush _n_ ih, _g_ agati, and pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti. The prayer may consist of as many\nverses as can be recited between midnight and daybreak; but there should be at\nleast one hymn in each of the seven metres to each of the three deities; nor\nshould the recitation consist of less than a hundred verses. From the\nbeginning of the recitation up to the end of the last hymn but one, Rig-veda\nI, 112, there is to be a gradual modulation of the voice so as to pass upwards\nthrough the seven tones (yama) of the deep scale (mandrasvara). Moreover, that\nhymn is to be repeated (if necessary) till daylight appears. As soon as this\nis the case, he passes on without any break from the last (25th) verse to the\nlast hymn (v. 75, 1-9), which he intones in the lowest tone of the middle\nscale, after shifting his place further east towards the gate. The recitation\nof the first eight verses of this hymn again gradually ascends through the\nwhole of the middle scale; when--after once more shifting his place so as to\nbe seated between the two door-posts--he intones the last verse--'The Dawn\nhath appeared with her shining kine, Agni hath been kindled at his appointed\ntime: your car hath been yoked, ye mighty, mead-loving(?) A _s_ vins,\nshowerers of wealth, hear my call!' in reciting which he makes his voice pass\nthrough the several tones of the high scale. The Subrahma _n_ ya, likewise,\nhas to chant the Subrahma _n_ ya litany (see [III, 3, 4,\n17](sbe2614.htm#3:3:4:17) seq.)--as he had to do on the previous evening--\ninserting in it the names of the sacrificer's father and son. The Agnidh, in\nthe meantime, prepares the five havis-oblations (savaniya _h_ puro _d_ a _s_ a\n_h_ ) to be offered at the morning-pressing (cf. [IV, 2, 4,\n18](sbe2648.htm#4:2:4:18)), and the Unnet _ri_ puts the numerous Soma-vessels\nin their respective places on the khara, and about the Soma-carts.\n\n[231:1](sbe2638.htm#fr_574) Cf. [IV, 3, 2, 1](sbe2651.htm#4:3:2:1) seq.\n\n[231:2](sbe2638.htm#fr_575) That is, when he recites the last verse, 'Ushas\nhath appeared,' &c.\n\n[231:3](sbe2638.htm#fr_576) Literally, 'Bend together (sa _m_ -nam),' which\nrefers to the 'bending together' of the cups at the Aponaptriya ceremony.\n\n[232:1](sbe2638.htm#fr_577) The text has rather to be construed, 'Ye stones,\nhear (my prayer) as (of one) knowing the sacrifice.'\n\n[232:2](sbe2638.htm#fr_578) While the Adhvaryu and assistants go to the water\nto fill the Ekadhana pitchers, the Hot _ri_ recites the so-called Aponaptriya\nhymn (Rig-veda X, 30) to the waters, omitting verse twelve, which was already\nrecited as the opening verse of the morning-prayer. The first verse is recited\nthrice, and the tenth verse is recited after the eleventh, while the priests\nare returning with the water. As soon as they are in sight, the Hot _ri_\nrecites verse 13, followed by Rig-veda V, 43, 1; and (when the Ekadhana and\nVasativari waters meet together, [paragraph 29](sbe2638.htm#3:9:3:29)) Rig-\nveda II, 35, 3; and, in case some of the water is actually poured over into\nthe Hot _ri_ 's cup, I, 83, 2. When the water is brought to the Havirdhana,\nthe Hot _ri_ addresses the Adhvaryu as stated in [paragraph\n31](sbe2638.htm#3:9:3:31); whereupon he pronounces a 'nigada' (for which see\nAit. Br. II, 20; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. Sr. V, 1, 14-17), followed by Rig-veda I, 23, i6;\nwhile the Ekadhana pitchers are carried past him. The water in the Maitravaru\n_n_ a cup and one third of both the Vasativari and Ekadhana water having been\npoured into the \xc3\x82dhavaniya trough (standing on the northern cart), the\npitchers with the remaining water are then deposited in their respective\nplaces behind the axle of the northern cart, whereupon the Hot _ri_ recites\nthe two remaining verses (24 and 15) of the p. 233 Aponaptriya hymn, and sits\ndown in front of the Soma, behind the northern door-post of the Havirdhana\n(cart-shed).\n\n[235:1](sbe2638.htm#fr_579) These are filled by the sacrificer's wife, or, if\nthere be more than one sacrificer (or, if the sacrificer have more than one\nwife), by all the wives, each having two vessels. For the use of this water,\nsee note on [IV, 4, 2, 18](sbe2656.htm#4:4:2:18).\n\n[235:2](sbe2638.htm#fr_580) The praishas or sacrificial directions to the Hot\n_ri_ , for the recitations of offering-formulas, are given by the Maitravaru\n_n_ a; see [p. 183](sbe2630.htm#page_183), note [2](sbe2630.htm#fn_462).\n\n[235:3](sbe2638.htm#fr_581) See note on [IV, 1, 3, 15](sbe2642.htm#4:1:3:15);\nthe nivids, part i, p. 114, note 2.\n\n[236:1](sbe2638.htm#fr_582) See p. 232, note 2 to [paragraph\n15](sbe2638.htm#3:9:3:15).\n\n[236:2](sbe2638.htm#fr_583) Nigrabhya _h_ is the technical name the Vasativari\nwater in the Hot _ri_ 's cup henceforth bears.
