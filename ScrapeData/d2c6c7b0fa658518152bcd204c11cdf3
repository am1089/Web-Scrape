And thus also (we must conclude, viz. that Brahman is the subject of the\nprevious passage), because (thus only) the declaration as to the beings, &c.\nbeing the feet is possible.\n\nThat the previous passage has Brahman for its topic, we must assume for that\nreason also that the text designates the beings and so on as the feet of\nGayatri. For the text at first speaks of the beings, the earth, the body, and\nthe heart 2, and then goes on 'that Gayatri has four feet and is sixfold.' For\nof the mere metre, without any reference to Brahman, it would be impossible to\nsay that the beings and so on are its feet. Moreover, if Brahman were not\nmeant, there would be no room for the verse, 'Such is the greatness,' &c. For\nthat verse clearly describes Brahman in its own nature; otherwise it would be\nimpossible to represent the Gayatri as the Self of everything as is done in\nthe words, 'One foot of it are all the beings; three feet of it are what is\nimmortal in heaven.' The purusha-sukta also ( _Ri_ k\n\np. 96\n\n[paragraph continues] Sa _m_ h. X, 90) exhibits the verse with sole reference\nto Brahman. Sm _ri_ ti likewise ascribes to Brahman a like nature, 'I stand\nsupporting all this world by a single portion of myself' (Bha. Gita X, 42).\nOur interpretation moreover enables us to take the passage, 'that Brahman\nindeed which,' &c. (III, 12, 7), in its primary sense, (i.e. to understand the\nword Brahman to denote nothing but Brahman.) And, moreover, the passage,\n'these are the five men of Brahman' (III, 13, 6), is appropriate only if the\nformer passage about the Gayatri is taken as referring to Brahman (for\notherwise the 'Brahman' in 'men of Brahman' would not be connected with the\nprevious topic). Hence Brahman is to be considered as the subject-matter of\nthe previous passage also. And the decision that the same Brahman is referred\nto in the passage about the light where it is recognised (to be the same) from\nits connexion with heaven, remains unshaken.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[95:2](sbe34032.htm#fr_132) Concerning the difficulty involved in this\ninterpretation, cp.
