They who have lost a Guru by death, or are afflicted by other misfortune,\nshould perform on the new-moon day an expiatory ceremony.\n\n2 2. Before sunrise they should carry their fire\n\np. 247\n\ntogether with its ashes and with its receptacle to the south with the half-\nverse, 'I send far away the flesh-devouring Agni' (Rig-veda X, 16, 9).\n\n3 3. Having thrown that (fire) down at a place where four roads meet or\nsomewhere else, they walk round it three times, turning their left sides\ntowards it, beating their left thighs with their left hands.\n\n4\\. They then should return home without looking back, bathe in water, have\ntheir hair, their beards the hair of their bodies, and their nails cut, and\nfurnish themselves with new jars, pots, vessels for rinsing the mouth,\nwreathed with garlands of _S_ ami flowers, with fuel of _S_ ami wood, with two\npieces of _S_ ami wood for kindling fire, and with branches to be laid round\nthe fire, with bull's dung and a bull's hide, fresh butter, a stone, and as\nmany bunches of Ku _s_ a grass as there are young women (in the house).\n\n5 5. At the time of the Agni(-hotra) he should kindle fire with the hemistich,\n'Here may this other _G_ atavedas' (Rig-veda X, 16, 9).\n\np. 248\n\n6\\. Keeping that (fire) burning, they sit till the silence of the night,\nrepeating the tales of the aged, and getting stories of auspicious contents,\nItihasas and Pura _n_ as, told to them.\n\n7 7. When all sounds have ceased, or when (the others) have gone to the house\nor the resting-place, (the performer of the ceremony) should pour out an\nuninterrupted stream of water, beginning at the south side of the door, with\n(the verse), 'Spinning the thread follow the light of the aerial space' (Rig-\nveda X, 53, 6), (going round the house), ending at the north side of the door.\n\n8 8. Having then given its place to the fire, and having spread to the west of\nit a bull's hide with the neck to the east, with the hair outside, he should\ncause the people belonging to the house to step on that (hide) with (the\nverse), 'Arise to long life, choosing old age' (Rig-veda X, 18, 6).\n\n9\\. With (the verse), 'This I lay round the living' (Rig-veda X, 18, 4), he\nshould lay branches round (the fire).\n\n10 10. After having with (the words), 'A mountain (i.e. a stone) they shall\nplace between themselves and death,' placed a stone to the north of the fire,\nand having sacrificed with the four (verses), 'Go hence, O death, on another\nway' (Rig-veda X, 18, 1-4),\n\np. 249\n\nverse by verse, he should look at his people with (the verse), 'As the days\nfollow each other' (ibid. 5).\n\n11\\. The young women (belonging to the house) should, with each hand\nseparately, with their thumbs and fourth fingers, with young Darbha blades,\nsalve their eyes with fresh butter, and throw (the Darbha blades) away,\nturning their faces away.\n\n12\\. (The performer of the ceremony) should look at them, while they are\nsalving themselves, with (the verse), 'These women, being no widows, having\nnoble husbands' (Rig-veda X, 18, 7).\n\n13\\. With (the verse), 'Carrying stones, (the river) streams forward; take\nhold of each other' (Rig-veda X, 53, 8)\xc2\x97the performer (of the ceremony) first\nshould touch the stone.\n\n14\\. After that, stationing himself to the northeast, while (the others) go\nround with the fire, with bull's dung, and with an uninterrupted stream of\nwater, repeating the three verses, 'O waters, ye are wholesome' (Rig-veda X,\n9, i seqq.), he should murmur the verse, 'These have led round the cow' (Rig-\nveda X, 155, 5).\n\n15\\. A tawny-coloured bull should he lead round\xc2\x97thus they say.\n\n16\\. They then sit down at a place where they intend to tarry, having put on\ngarments that have not yet been washed.\n\n17\\. (There) they sit, avoiding to sleep, till sunrise.\n\n18 18. After sunrise, having murmured the hymns sacred to the sun and the\nauspicious hymns, having\n\np. 250\n\nprepared food, having made oblations with (the hymn), 'May he drive evil away\nfrom us with his shine' (Rig-veda I, 97), verse by verse, having given to the\nBrahma _n_ as to eat, he should cause (them) to pronounce auspicious words.\n\n19\\. A cow, a cup of metal, and a garment that has not yet been washed,\nconstitute the sacrificial fee.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[246:2](sbe29151.htm#fr_616) 6, 2. According to Naraya _n_ a the fire means\nhere not the sacred domestic fire, but a common kitchen fire. I doubt whether\nthe p. 247 commentator is right. The ceremonies described in the following\nSutras seem to point rather to a renewal of the sacred G _ri_ hya fire, the\nold one having proved unlucky to the sacrificer. In the same way, in the _S_\nrauta ritual, a sacrificer who, after having performed the \xc3\x82dhana, has bad\nluck, performs the Punaradheya.\n\n[247:3](sbe29151.htm#fr_617) Comp. Katyayana- _S_ rauta-sutra V, 10, r5.\n\n[247:5](sbe29151.htm#fr_618) The text has agnivelayam, which Naraya _n_ a\nexplains by agnihotravihara _n_ akale aparahne. He states that the fire should\nbe produced by attrition of two new kindling woods (ara _n_ i), mentioned in\nSutra 4. The fire thus kindled is to be used, he says, as a kitchen-fire.\nHerein he seems to me to have misunderstood the meaning of the ceremony; see\nthe note on Sutra 2. The hemistich quoted in this Sutra (which is the second\nhalf of the same verse of which the first half is prescribed in Sutra 2)\nclearly points to the sacred quality of the fire in question; it runs thus,\n'Here may this other _G_ atavedas carry the offerings to the gods, the knowing\none.'\n\n[248:7](sbe29151.htm#fr_619) The person who pours out the water is, as Naraya\n_n_ a says, the kart _ri_ , i.e. the performer of the whole ceremony. The word\ncannot be translated, as Prof. Stenzler does, der Bestatter, no funeral\nceremonies being here treated of.\n\n[248:8](sbe29151.htm#fr_620) See above, I, 8, 9. Here Naraya _n_ a sees that\nthe fire is the sacred one. He says, atha _s_ abdo\xe0\xa4\xbdsmin kale\xe0\xa4\xbdgnyantaram\naupasanam upasamadadhyad iti _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ apanartham.\n\n[248:10](sbe29151.htm#fr_621) The words, 'A mountain,' &c., stand at the end\nof the verse quoted in Sutra 9.\n\n[249:18](sbe29151.htm#fr_622) See above, II, 3, 13.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 7](sbe29152.htm)\n\n"
