With our offerings revering in our mind Agni Vai _s_ vanara, the follower\nof truth, the finder of the sun--we, the Ku _s_ ikas\n[1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:1:1), desirous of goods, call with our prayers the\ngod who gives rain, the charioteer, the, cheerful.\n\n2\\. We call that beautiful Agni to help us, Vai _s_ vanara, Matari _s_ van the\npraiseworthy [1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:2:1); we the men (call) B _ri_ haspati\n[2](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:2:2) for (the worship) of the divine host, the priest\nwho hears us, the. guest who swiftly glides along.\n\n3\\. Vai _s_ vanara, neighing like a horse, is kindled by the women\n[1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:3:1), by the Ku _s_ ikas, from age to age; may this\nAgni give us abundance in valiant men and in horses and treasures, he who\nwakes among the immortals.\n\n\n\n4\\. May the Va _g_ as [1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:4:1) come forward, the Agnis\nwith their powers. United [2](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:4:2) they have harnessed\nthe spotted deer for their triumphal procession [3](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:4:3).\nThe Maruts, mightily growing, the all-wealthy, make the mountains tremble, the\nunbeguiled ones.\n\n5\\. The Maruts who possess the beauty of Agni [1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:5:1),\nbelong to all races of men. We implore their fierce, strong help. They are\ntumultuous, the sons of Rudra, clothed in rain, hot-spirited like lions\n[2](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:5:2), givers of rain.\n\n6\\. We implore with our best praises every host, every troop (of the Maruts)\n[1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:6:1), the splendour of Agni,\n\np. 293\n\nthe power of the Maruts. With the spotted deer as horses\n[2](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:6:2), with gifts that cannot be taken away, they go\nto the sacrifice wise in the (sacrificial) ordinances\n[3](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:6:3).\n\n\n\n7\\. Agni am I, by birth _G_ atavedas. Ghee is my eye; (the drink of)\nimmortality is in my mouth. The threefold song [1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:7:1)\ntraversing the aerial space, the imperishable Gharma\n[2](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:7:2), the sacrificial food am I by name.\n\n8\\. With three purifying strainers he (Agni) purified the song, with his heart\nthe thought, discovering the light. The mightiest treasure he produced by the\npowers of his own nature, and then he looked over heaven and earth.\n\n9\\. Carry him who is the inexhaustible spring with a hundred rills, who has\nknowledge of prayers (?), the father of (every speech) that should be uttered,\nthe roaring one [1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:9:1), gladly excited in the lap of\nhis parents--carry him the truth-speaking across (all dangers), O ye two\nworlds!\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nVi _s_ vamitra is the _Ri_ shi of this Sukta with the exception of the seventh\nverse of which the \xc3\x82tman or Brahman is the _Ri_ shi. The metre is _G_ agati\nverses 1-6, Trish _t_ ubh verses 7-9.--Verse 5 = TB. II, 7, 12, 3. Verse 7 =\nVS. XVIII, 66; MS. IV, 12, 5.\n\nThe position of this Sukta in the collection shows that it is to be divided\ninto three independent hymns. This is confirmed by the metre, the first and\nsecond of these three hymns being in _G_ agati, the third in Trish _t_ ubh,\nand also by the contents: the first hymn is addressed to Agni Vai _s_ vanara,\nthe second to Agni accompanied by the Maruts, the third contains mystical\nspeculations about the nature and the deeds of Agni.\n\np. 294\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The Ku _s_ ikas are identical with the Vi _s_ vamitras, or possibly\nthe latter form one branch of the Ku _s_ ikas; see H. O., Zeitschrift der\nDeutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, XLII, 209.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. On the relation of Matari _s_ van to Agni, see above, I, 96, 4, note\n1.\n\nNote 2. B _ri_ haspati, though in his origin distinct from Agni, is here\nidentified with him, like Matari _s_ van.\n\n#### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. By the ten fingers. Comp. above, I, 71, 1.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. I adopt the interpretation of Bergaigne (Religion Vedique, II, 405,\nnote 1) and Pischel (Vedische Studien, I, 46). Va\xc2\xb4 _g_ a _h_ seems to be the\nproper name synonym with _Ri_ bhava _h_ ; the Maruts may be called Va\xc2\xb4 _g_ a\n_h_ as they are called several times _Ri_ bhuksha _n_ a _h_. But it is\npossible that we should have to translate simply, 'May the powers of\nstrength,' &c.; comp. below, 27, 1.\n\nNote 2. Possibly we have to supply, 'united with their spotted deer, with\ntheir beauty,' &c.; see II, 36, 2. ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ai _h_ sammi _s_ la _h_ p _r\ni_shatibhi _h_ _ri_ sh _t_ ibhi _h_ ; VII, 56, 6. _s_ riya\xc2\xb4 sammi _s_ la _h_.\nOr the meaning may be, 'the Maruts united with Agni or with the Agnis;' comp.\nI, 166, 11. sammi _s_ la _h_ indre.\n\nNote 3. On _s_ ubhe, see M. M., I, 87, 3, note 2 (vol. xxxii, p. 162).\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Or, they receive their beauty through Agni.\n\nNote 2. Of heshakratu the probable explanation has been given by Pischel,\nVedische Studien, I, 48. See also von Bradke, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVIII, 297.\n\np. 295\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Comp. V, 53, II, vol. xxxii, p. 320.\n\nNote 2. Comp. II, 34, 4, vol. xxxii, p. 302, note 5.\n\nNote 3. The text has vidatheshu.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VIII, 51, 4. arkam sapta _s_ irsha _n_ am \xe2\x80\xa6 tridha\xc2\xb4tum uttame\npade. Is the song called tridha\xc2\xb4tu because it is sung by the three Udgat _ri_\ns (singers)? Or because it generally comprises three verses (see H. O.,\nZeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, XXXVIII, 453)?\n\nNote 2. The Gharma is the offering of hot milk brought to the A _s_ vins. On\nthe probable meaning of this offering, see H. O., Religion des Veda, 447 seq.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. The translation of me _l_ i (comp. IV, 7, 11; Atharva-veda XI, 7, 5;\nTaitt. Sa _m_ h. V, 7, 8, 1) is quite conjectural.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 27](sbe46087.htm)\n\n"
