Cessation dependent on a sublative act of the mind, and cessation not so\ndependent cannot be established, there being no (complete) interruption.\n\nThe Bauddhas who maintain that universal destruction is going on constantly,\nassume that 'whatever forms an object of knowledge and is different from the\ntriad is produced (sa _m_ sk _ri_ ta) and momentary.' To the triad there\nmentioned they give the names 'cessation dependent on a sublative act of the\nmind,' 'cessation not dependent on such an act,' and 'space.' This triad they\nhold to be non-substantial, of a merely negative character (abhavamatra),\ndevoid of all positive characteristics. By 'cessation dependent on a sublative\nact of the mind,' we have to understand such destruction of entities as is\npreceded by an act of thought  1; by 'cessation not so dependent' is meant\ndestruction of the opposite kind  2; by 'space' is meant absence in general of\nsomething covering (or occupying space). Out of these three non-existences\n'space' will be refuted later on (Sutra 24), the two other ones are refuted in\nthe present Sutra.\n\nCessation which is dependent on a sublative act of the mind, and cessation\nwhich is not so dependent are both impossible, 'on account of the absence of\ninterruption.' For both kinds of cessation must have reference either to the\nseries (of momentary existences) or to the single members constituting the\nseries.--The former alternative is impossible, because in all series (of\nmomentary existences) the members of the series stand in an unbroken relation\nof cause and effect so that the series cannot be interrupted  3.--The latter\n\np. 411\n\nalternative is likewise inadmissible, for it is impossible to maintain that\nany momentary existence should undergo complete annihilation entirely\nundefinable and disconnected (with the previous state of existence), since we\nobserve that a thing is recognised in the various states through which it may\npass and thus has a connected existence  1. And in those cases also where a\nthing is not clearly recognised (after having undergone a change) we yet\ninfer, on the ground of actual observations made in other cases, that one and\nthe same thing continues to exist without any interruption.--For these reasons\nthe two kinds of cessation which the Bauddhas assume cannot be proved.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[410:1](sbe34198.htm#fr_401) As when a man smashes a jar having previously\nformed the intention of doing so.\n\n[410:2](sbe34198.htm#fr_402) I. e. the insensible continual decay of things.--\nViparita iti pratiksha _n_ a _m_ gha _t_ adina _m_ yuktya sadhyamano#ku _s_\nalair avagantum a _s_ akya _h_ sukshmo vina _s_ o#pratisa _m_ khyanirodha _h_.\nBrahmav.\n\n[410:3](sbe34198.htm#fr_403) A series of momentary existences constituting a\nchain of causes and effects can never be entirely stopped; for the last\nmomentary existence must be supposed either to produce its effect or not to\nproduce it. In the former case the series is continued; the latter alternative\nwould imply that the last link does not really p. 411 exist, since the\nBauddhas define the satta of a thing as its causal efficiency (cp. Sarvadar\n_s_ a _n_ asa _m_ graha). And the non-existence of the last link would\nretrogressively lead to the non-existence of the whole series.\n\n[411:1](sbe34198.htm#fr_404) Thus clay is recognised as such whether it\nappears in the form of a jar, or of the potsherds into which the jar is\nbroken, or of the powder into which the potsherds are ground.--Analogously we\ninfer that even things which seem to vanish altogether, such as a drop of\nwater which has fallen on heated iron, yet continue to exist in some form.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 23](sbe34199.htm)\n\n"
