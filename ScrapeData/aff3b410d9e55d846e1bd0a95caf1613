Endowed with exceeding vigour and power, the singers, the never flinching,\nthe immovable, the impetuous, the most beloved and most manly, have decked\nthemselves with their glittering ornaments, a few only\n[1](sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:1:1), like the heavens with the stars,\n\n2\\. When you have seen your way through the clefts, like birds, O Maruts, on\nwhatever road it be [1](sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:2:1), then the casks (clouds) on\nyour chariots trickle everywhere, and you pour out the honey-like fatness (the\nrain) for him who praises you.\n\n3\\. At their racings the earth shakes, as if broken\n[1](sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:3:1), when on the (heavenly) paths they harness (their\ndeer) for victory [2](sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:3:2). They the sportive, the\nroaring, with bright spears, the shakers (of the clouds) have themselves\nglorified their greatness.\n\n4\\. That youthful company (of the Maruts), with their spotted horses\n[1](sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:4:1), moves by itself; hence\n[2](sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:4:2) it exercises lordship, invested with powers. Thou\nindeed art true, thou searchest out sin [3](sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:4:3), thou art\nwithout blemish. Therefore the manly host will help this prayer.\n\n5\\. We speak after the kind of our old father, our tongue goes forth at the\nsight [1](sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:5:1) of the Soma: when the singers (the Maruts)\nhad joined Indra in deed [2](sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:5:2), then only they took\ntheir holy names;--\n\n6\\. These Maruts, armed with beautiful rings, obtained splendours for their\nglory [1](sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:6:1), they obtained [2](sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:6:2)\nrays, and men to celebrate them; nay, armed with daggers, speeding along, and\nfearless, they found the beloved domain of the Maruts\n[3](sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:6:3).\n\np. 160\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to Gotama. No verse in SV., VS., AV.\n\nVerse 2 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 7.\n\nVerse 3 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 7.\n\nVerse 6 = TS. II, 1, 11, 2; IV, 2, 11, 2.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Ke _k_ it refers to the Maruts, who are represented as gradually\nrising or just showing themselves, as yet only few in number, like the first\nstars in the sky. Ke _k_ it, some, is opposed to sarve, all. The same\nexpression occurs again, V, 52, 12, where the Maruts are compared to a few\nthieves. B. and R., and those who follow them, translate usra\xc2\xb4 _h_ iva st _r\ni_-bhi _h_ by 'like cows marked with stars on their foreheads.' Such cows no\ndoubt exist, but they can hardly be said to become visible by these frontal\nstars, as the Maruts by their ornaments. We must take usra\xc2\xb4 _h_ here in the\nsame sense as dya\xc2\xb4va _h_ ; II, 34, 2, it is said that the Maruts were\nperceived dya\xc2\xb4va _h_ na st _r i_-bhi _h_ , like the heavens with the stars.\n\nI, 166, 11. dure-d _r i_ _s_ a _h_ ye divya\xc2\xb4 _h_ -iva st _r i_-bhi _h_.\n\nWho are visible far away, like the heavens (or heavenly beings) by the stars.\n\nAnd the same is said of Agni, II, 2, 5. dyau _h_ na st _r i_bhi _h_ _k_ itayat\nrodasi (iti) anu. St _r i_bhi _h_ occurs I, 68, 5; IV, 7, 3; VI, 49, 3; 12. It\nalways means stars, and the meaning of rays (strahl) rests, as yet, on\netymological authority only. The evening sky would, no doubt, be more\nappropriate than usra\xc2\xb4 _h_ , which applies chiefly to the dawn. But in the\nIndian mind, the two dawns, i. e. the dawn and the gloaming, are so closely\nunited and identified, that their names, too, are frequently interchangeable.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. I translate yayi not by a goer, a traveller, i. e. the\n\np. 161\n\ncloud (this is the explanation proposed by Saya _n_ a, and adopted by\nProfessor Benfey), but by path. Saya _n_ a (TS. IV, 3, 13, 7) renders yayim by\ngatim. Etymologically yayi may mean either, and in some passages I feel\ndoubtful as to which is the more appropriate meaning. But in parallel passages\nyayi is clearly replaced by ya\xc2\xb4ma. Thus:\n\nVIII, 7, 2. yat--ya\xc2\xb4mam _s_ ubhra _h_ a _k_ idhvam.\n\nWhen you, bright Maruts, have seen your way.\n\nSee also VIII, 7, 4. yat ya\xc2\xb4mam ya\xc2\xb4nti vayu-bhi _h_.\n\nWhen they (the Maruts) go on their path with the winds.\n\nVIII, 7, 14. adhi-iva yat giri _n_ a\xc2\xb4m ya\xc2\xb4mam _s_ ubhra _h_ a _k_ idhvam.\n\nWhen you, bright Maruts, had seen your way, as it were, from above the\nmountains.\n\nThe same phrase occurs, even without ya\xc2\xb4ma or yayi, in\n\nV, 55, 7. na parvata _h_ na nadya\xc2\xb4 _h_ varanta va _h_ yatra a _k_ idhvam\nmaruta _h_ ga _k_ _kh_ ata it u tat.\n\nNot mountains, not rivers, keep you back; where you have seen (your way),\nthere you go.\n\nThough yayi does not occur frequently in the Rig-veda, the meaning of path\nseems throughout more applicable than that of traveller.\n\nV, 87, 5. tvesha _h_ yayi _h_.\n\nYour path, O Maruts, is blazing.\n\nV, 73, 7. ugra _h_ vam kakuha _h_ yayi _h_.\n\nFearful is your pass on high.\n\nI, 51, 11. ugra _h_ yayim ni _h_ apa _h_ srotasa asri _g_ at.\n\nThe fearful Indra sent the waters forth on their way streaming.\n\nX, 92, 5. pra--yayina yanti sindhava _h_.\n\nThe waters go forth on their path.\n\nLudwig takes ko _s_ a as buckets on the chariots of the Maruts, which seems\nright.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Cf. I, 37, 8, page 75. There is no authority for Saya _n_ a's\nexplanation of vithura\xc2\xb4-iva, the earth trembles like a widow. Vithura\xc2\xb4 occurs\nseveral times in the Rig-veda, but never in the sense of widow. Thus:\n\np. 162\n\nI, 168, 6. yat _k_ yavayatha vithura\xc2\xb4-iva sam-hitam.\n\nWhen you, Maruts, throw down what is compact, like brittle things.\n\nI, 186, 2; VI, 25, 3; 46, 6; VIII, 96, 2; X, 77, 4 (vithuryati). The Maruts\nthemselves are called avithura in verse 1. Spiegel compares the Zend\naiwithura. As to a _g_ ma and ya\xc2\xb4ma, see I, 37, 8, page\n[75](sbe3218.htm#page_75).\n\nNote 2. _S_ ubh is one of those words to which it is very difficult always to\nassign a definite special meaning. Being derived from _s_ ubh, to shine, the\ncommentator has no difficulty in explaining it by splendour, beauty; sometimes\nby water. But although _s_ ubh means originally splendour, and is used in that\nsense in many passages, yet there are others where so vague a meaning seems\nvery inappropriate. In our verse Saya _n_ a proposes two translations, either,\n'When the Maruts harness the clouds,' or, 'When the Maruts harness their\nchariots, for the bright rain-water.' Now the idea that the Maruts harness\ntheir chariots in order to make the clouds yield their rain, can hardly be\nexpressed by the simple word subhe, i. e. for brightness' sake. As the Maruts\nare frequently praised for their glittering ornaments, their splendour might\nbe intended in this passage, as it certainly is in others. Thus:\n\nI, 85, 3. yat _s_ ubhayante a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ i-bhi _h_ tanu\xc2\xb4shu _s_ ubhra\xc2\xb4 _h_\ndadhire virukmata _h_.\n\nWhen the Maruts adorn themselves with glittering ornaments, the brilliant ones\nput bright weapons on their bodies.\n\nVII, 56, 6. subha\xc2\xb4 sobhish _th_ a _h_ , _s_ riya\xc2\xb4 sam-mi _s_ la _h_ , o _g_ a\n_h_ -bhi _h_ ugra\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nThe most brilliant by their brilliancy, united with beauty, terrible by\nterrors.\n\nIn I, 64, 4, I have translated vaksha _h_ -su rukma\xc2\xb4n adhi yetire _s_ ubhe by\n'they fix gold (chains) on their chests for beauty.' And the same meaning is\napplicable to I, 117, 5, subhe rukmam na dar _s_ atam ni-khatam, and other\npassages: IV, 51, 6; VI, 63, 6.\n\nBut in our verse and others which we shall examine, beauty and brilliancy\nwould be very weak renderings for\n\np. 163\n\n_s_ ubhe. 'When they harnessed their chariots or their deer for the sake of\nbeauty,' means nothing, or, at least, very little. I take, therefore, _s_ ubhe\nin this and similar phrases in the sense of triumph or glory or victory. 'When\nthey harness their chariots for to conquer,' implies brilliancy, glory,\nvictory, but it conveys at the same time a tangible meaning. Let us now see\nwhether the same meaning is appropriate in other passages:\n\nI, 23, 11. _g_ ayatam-iva tanyatu _h_ marutam eti dh _ri_ sh _n_ uya\xc2\xb4 yat _s_\nubham yatha _n_ a nara _h_.\n\nThe thundering voice of the Maruts comes fiercely, like that of conquerors,\nwhen you go to conquer, O men!\n\nSaya _n_ a: 'When you go to the brilliant place of sacrifice.' Wilson: 'When\nyou accept the auspicious (offering).' Benfey: 'Wenn ihr euren Schmuck nehmt.'\n\nV, 57, 2. yathana _s_ ubham, you go to conquer. Cf. V, 55, 1.\n\nSaya _n_ a: 'For the sake of water, or, in a chariot.'\n\nV, 52, 8. _s_ ardha _h_ ma\xc2\xb4rutam ut _s_ a _m_ sa--uta sma te _s_ ubhe nara _h_\npra syandra\xc2\xb4 _h_ yu _g_ ata tmana.\n\nPraise the host of the Maruts, whether they, the men, the quickly moving, have\nby themselves harnessed (the chariots) for conquest.\n\nSaya _n_ a: 'For the sake of water.' Cf. X, 105, 3.\n\nV, 57, 3. _s_ ubhe yat ugra _h_ p _r i_shati _h_ ayugdhvam.\n\nWhen you have harnessed the deer for conquest.\n\nSaya _n_ a: 'For the sake of water.'\n\nIII, 26, 4. _s_ ubhe--pishati _h_ ayukshata.\n\nThey had harnessed the deer for victory.\n\nSaya _n_ a: 'They had harnessed in the water the deer together (with the\nfires).'\n\nV, 63, 5. ratham yu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ate maruta _h_ _s_ ubhe su-kham su\xc2\xb4ra _h_ na--go-\nish _t_ ishu.\n\nThe Maruts harness the chariot meet for conquest, like a hero in battles.\n\nSaya _n_ a: 'For the sake of water.'\n\nI, 88, 2. _s_ ubhe kam yanti--a _s_ vai _h_.\n\nThe Maruts go on their horses towards conquest.\n\nSaya _n_ a: 'In order to brighten the worshipper, or, for the sake of water.'\n\np. 164\n\nI, 119, 3. sam yat mitha _h_ pasp _ri_ dhana\xc2\xb4sa _h_ agmata _s_ ubhe makha\xc2\xb4 _h_\namita _h_ _g_ ayava _h_ ra _n_ e.\n\nWhen striving with each other they came together, for the sake of glory, the\nbrisk (Maruts), immeasurable (in strength), panting for victory in the fight.\n\nSaya _n_ a: 'For the sake of brilliant wealth.'\n\nVII, 82, 5. marut-bhi _h_ ugra _h_ subham anya _h_ iyate.\n\nThe other, the fearful (Indra), goes with the Maruts to glory.\n\nSaya _n_ a: 'He takes brilliant decoration.'\n\nI, 167, 6. a\xc2\xb4 asthapayanta yuvatim yuvana _h_ _s_ ubhe nimi _s_ lam.\n\nThe Maruts, the youths, placed the maid (lightning on their chariot), their\ncompanion for victory ( _s_ ubhe nimi _s_ lam).\n\nSaya _n_ a: 'For the sake of water, or, on the brilliant chariot.' Cf. I, 127,\n6; 165, I.\n\nVI, 62, 4. _s_ ubham p _r i_ksham isham u\xc2\xb4r _g_ am vahanta.\n\nThe A _s_ vins bringing glory, wealth, drink, and food.\n\nVIII, 26, 13. _s_ ubhe _k_ akrate, you bring him to glory.\n\n_S_ ubham-ya\xc2\xb4van is an epithet of the Maruts, I, 89, 7; V, 61, 13. Cf. _s_\nubhra-yavana, VIII, 26, 19 (A _s_ vinau).\n\n_S_ ubham-ya\xc2\xb4, of the wind, IV, 3, 6.\n\n_S_ ubham-yu, of the rays of the dawn, X, 78, 7.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Saya _n_ a: 'With spotted deer for their horses.' See I, 37, 2, note\n1, page [70](sbe3218.htm#page_70); as Pushan is called a _g_ a _s_ va, having\ngoats for his horses, RV. V, 58, 2.\n\nThat the Maruts have not only p _ri_ shatis, but horses for their chariots, we\nhave seen before. In I, 88, 1, we have a _s_ vapar _n_ ai _h_ rathebhi _h_.\n\nNote 2. Aya\xc2\xb4 is a word of very rare occurrence in the Rig-veda. It is the\ninstrum. sing. of the feminine pronominal base a or i, and as a pronoun\nfollowed by a noun it is frequently to be met with; V, 45, 11. aya\xc2\xb4 dhiya\xc2\xb4,\n&c. But in our verse it is irregular in form as not entering into Sandhi with\ni _s_ ana _h_. This irregularity, however, which might have led us to suppose\nan original aya\xc2\xb4 _h_ , indefatigable, corresponding\n\np. 165\n\nwith the following asi, is vouched for by the Pada text, in such matters a\nbetter authority than the Sa _m_ hita text, and certainly in this case fully\nborne out by the Prati _s_ akhya, I, 163, 10. Unless we read aya\xc2\xb4 _h_ , we\nmust take aya\xc2\xb4 as an adverb, in the sense of thus or hence; cf. VI, 66, 4. In\nsome passages where aya\xc2\xb4 seems thus to be used as an adverb, it would be\nbetter to supply a noun from the preceding verse. Thus in II, 6, 2, aya\xc2\xb4\nrefers to samidham in II, 6, 1. In VI, 17, 15, a similar noun, samidha or\ngira\xc2\xb4, should be supplied. But there are other passages where, unless we\nsuppose that the verse was meant to illustrate a ceremonial act, such as the\nplacing of a samidh, and that aya\xc2\xb4 pointed to it, we must take it as a simple\nadverb, like the Greek \xcf\x84\xe1\xbf\xb7: RV. III, 12, 2; IX, 53, 2; 106, 14. In X, 116, 9,\nthe Pada reads aya _h_ -iva, not aya, as given by Roth; in VI, 66, 4, aya nu,\nthe accent is likewise on the first.\n\nNote 3. _Ri_ _n_ a-ya\xc2\xb4van is well explained by B. and R. as going after debt,\nsearching out sin. Saya _n_ a, though he explains _ri_ _n_ a-ya\xc2\xb4van by\nremoving sin, derives it nevertheless correctly from _ri_ _n_ a and ya, and\nnot from yu. The same formation is found in _s_ ubham-ya\xc2\xb4van, &c.; and as\nthere is _ri_ _n_ a-ya\xc2\xb4 besides _ri_ _n_ a-ya\xc2\xb4van, so we find _s_ ubham-ya\xc2\xb4\nbesides _s_ ubham-ya\xc2\xb4van. Ludwig prefers the derivation from yu.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The Soma-juice inspires the poet with eloquence.\n\nNote 2. _S_ ami occurs again in II, 31, 6; III, 55, 3; VIII, 45, 27; X, 40, 1.\nGrassmann has shown that it may be taken as an instrum. of _s_ ami, meaning\nwork, but with special reference to the toil of the battle-field or the\nsacrifice. It is used in the former sense in\n\nVIII, 45, 27. vi ana _t_ turva _n_ e _s_ ami.\n\nHe (Indra) was able to overcome, lit. he reached to, or he arrived at the\novercoming or at victory by toil.\n\nBut, like other words which have the general meaning of working or toiling,\n_s_ ami is used both in a general sense, and in the more special sense of\nsacrifice.\n\nX, 40, 1. vasto _h_ -vasto _h_ vahamanam dhiya\xc2\xb4 _s_ ami.\n\np. 166\n\nYour chariot, O A _s_ vins, driven along every morning by thought and deed.\n\nII, 31, 6. apa\xc2\xb4m napat a _s_ u-hema dhiya\xc2\xb4 sami.\n\nApam napat (Agni) moving quickly by thought and deed.\n\nIn these two passages it might be possible, with a slight alteration of the\naccent, to read dhiya- _s_ ami as one word. Dhiya-sam would mean the\nsacrificer who is engaged in prayer; cf. dhiya- _g_ ur, V, 43, 15. Thus we\nread:\n\nVI, 2, 4. ya _h_ te su-da\xc2\xb4nave dhiya\xc2\xb4 marta _h_ _s_ a _s_ amate.\n\nThe mortal who toils for thee, the liberal god, with prayer.\n\nThere is no necessity, however, for such a change, and the authority of the\nMSS. is against it. See also IX, 74, 7.\n\nIn III, 55, 3, _s_ ami a _k_ _kh_ a didye purvya\xc2\xb4 _n_ i, Roth takes sami as an\nacc. plur. neut., Lanman as an instrum., Grassmann as a locative.\n\nI glance back at the former sacrifices. See B. R. s.v. di and _s_ ami.\n\nIn other passages the feminine sami seems to mean work, sacrificial work, but,\nas far as we can see, not simply sacrifice. Thus the _Ri_ bhus and others are\nsaid to have acquired immortality by their work or works, _s_ ami or _s_\namibhi _h_ , I, 20, 2; 110, 4; III, 60, 3; IV, 33, 4. Cf. IV, 22, 8; 17, 18;\nV, 42, 10; 77, 4; VI, 52, 1; VIII, 75, 14; IX, 74, 7; X, 28, 12. In VI, 3, 2,\nwe read:\n\ni _g_ e ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ebhi _h_ _s_ a _s_ ame samibhi _h_.\n\nI have sacrificed with sacrifices, I have worked with pious works.\n\nHere the verb _s_ am must be taken in the sense of working, or performing\nceremonial worship, while in other places (III, 29, 16; V, 2, 7) it may be\nperhaps taken in the more special sense of singing songs of praise. The Greek\n\xce\xba\xce\xac\xce\xbc-\xce\xbd\xcf\x89, to work, to labour, to tire (Sanskrit _s_ amyati), the Greek \xce\xba\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xce\xb9\xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb5\nand \xce\xba\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xce\xaf\xce\xb6\xcf\x89, to labour for or take care of a person, and possibly even the\nGreek \xce\xba\xe1\xbf\xb6\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 a song or a festival (not a village song), may all find their\nexplanation in the Sanskrit root _s_ am.\n\nThe idea that the Maruts did not originally enjoy divine\n\np. 167\n\nhonours will occur again and again: cf. I, 6, 4; 72, 3. A similar expression\nis used of the _Ri_ bhus, I, 20, 8, &c. But while originally the expression of\nobtaining sacred names meant no more than obtaining a sacred or divine\ncharacter, it was soon taken literally, and a number of names were invented\nfor the Maruts which even in the Va _g_ asan. Sa _m_ hita XVII, 80-85 amount\nto 49, i. e. 7 \xc3\x97 7\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iya, properly 'worthy of sacrifice,' has the\nmeaning of divine or sacred. The Greek \xe1\xbc\x85\xce\xb3\xce\xb9\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 has been compared with ya _g_ ya,\nsacrificio colendus, which is not a Vedic word.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. _S_ riyase kam seems to be the same as the more frequent _s_ riye kam.\nSriyase only occurs twice more, V, 59, 3. The chief irregularity consists in\nthe absence of Gu _n_ a, which is provided for by Pa _n_ ini's kasen (III, 4,\n9). Similar infinitives, if they may so be called, are bhiyase, V, 29, 4; v\n_ri_ dhase, V, 64, 5; dhruvase, VII, 70, 1; tu _g_ ase, IV, 23, 7; _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_\n_g_ ase, VIII, 4, 17; v _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ase, VIII, 76, 1; _ri_ _k_ ase, VII, 61,\n6. In VI, 39, 5, ri _k_ ase may be a dat. sing. of the masculine, to the\npraiser.\n\nNote 2. Mimikshire from myaksh, to be united with. Ra _s_ mi, rays, after\nbhanu, splendour, may seem weak. It might be possible to assign to ra _s_ mi\nthe meaning of reins, and take _ri_ kvabhir in the sense of sounding or\ntinkling. In V, 79, 8, ar _k_ i is used in juxtaposition with ra _s_ mi.\n\nNote 3. The bearing of this concluding verse is not quite clear, unless we\ntake it as a continuation of the preceding verse. It was there said that the\nMaruts (the _r i_kva _n_ a _h_ ) obtained their holy names after having joined\nIndra in his work, which means that they then and there became what they are.\nHaving thus obtained their true character and a place among the gods, they may\nbe said to have won at the same time splendour, and worshippers to sing their\npraises, and to have established themselves in what became afterwards known as\ntheir own domain, their own place among the gods who are invoked at the\nsacrifice. See VII, 58, 1.\n\nThe metre requires that we should read dhamana _h_.\n\np. 168\n\nBenfey translates: Gedeih'n zu spenden woll'n die schongeschmucketen mit\nLichtern, Strahlen mit Lobsangern regenen; die brullenden, furchtlosen,\nsturmischen, sie sind bekannt als Glieder des geliebten Marutstamms.\n\nWilson: Combining with the solar rays, they have willingly poured down (rain)\nfor the welfare (of mankind), and, hymned by the priests, have been pleased\npartakers of the (sacrificial food). Addressed with praises, moving swiftly,\nand exempt from fear, they have become possessed of a station agreeable and\nsuitable to the Maruts.\n\nLudwig: Zu herlichkeit haben dise sich mit liechtglanz versehen, mit sausenden\nzugeln die schonberingten, schwertbewaffnet die kraftvollen, ohne furcht\nbesitzen sie die freundliche Marutmacht.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 88.
