The name of brahmi-upanishad (IV, 7) can hardly be considered as a\ntitle. It means \'the teaching of Brahman,\' and is used with reference to other\nUpanishads also 1. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, in his commentary, tells us that this Upanishad\nforms the ninth adhyaya of a Brahma _n_ a, or, if we take his words quite\nliterally, he says, \'the beginning of the ninth adhyaya is "the Upanishad\nbeginning with the words Keneshitam, and treating of the Highest Brahman has\nto be taught."\' In the eight preceeding adhyayas, he tells us, all the sacred\nrites or sacrifices had been fully explained, and likewise the meditations\n(upasana) on the pra _n_ a (vital breath) which belongs to all these\nsacrifices, and those meditations also which have reference to the fivefold\nand sevenfold Samans. After that followed Gayatra-saman and the Va _m_ _s_ a,\nthe genealogical list. All this would naturally form the subject of a Sama-\nveda-brahma _n_ a, and we find portions corresponding to the description given\nby _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara in the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad, e _g_. the fivefold Saman, II, 2;\nthe sevenfold Saman, II, 8; the Gayatra-saman, III, 12, I.\n\n\xc3\x82nanda _g_ \xc3\xb1ana tells us that our Upanishad belonged to the Sakha of the\nTalavakaras.\n\nAll this had formerly to be taken on trust, because no Brahma _n_ a was known\ncontaining the Upanishad. Dr. Burnell, however, has lately discovered a Brahma\n_n_ a of the Sama-veda which comes very near the description given by _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara. In a letter dated Tanjore, 8th Dec. 1878, he\n\np. xc\n\nwrites: \'It appears to me that you would be glad to know the following about\nthe Kena-upanishad, as it occurs in my MS. of the Talavakara-brahma _n_ a.\n\n\'The last book but one of this Brahma _n_ a is termed Upanishad-brahma _n_ a.\nIt consists of 145 khandas treating of the Gayatra-saman, and the 134th is a\nVamsa. The Kena-upanishad comprises the 135-145 khandas, or the tenth anuvaka\nof a chapter. The 139th section begins: asa va idam agra asit, &c.\n\n\'My MS. of the Talavakara-brahma _n_ a agrees, as regards the contents,\nexactly with what _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara says, but not in the divisions. He says that the\nKena-upanishad begins the ninth adhyaya, but that is not so in my MS. Neither\nthe beginning nor the end of this Upanishad is noticed particularly.\n\n\'The last book of this Brahma _n_ a is the \xc3\x82rsheya-brahma _n_ a, which I\nprinted last February.\n\n\'Among the teachers quoted in the Brahma _n_ a I have noticed both Tandya and\n_S_ a _t_ yayani. I should not be surprised to find in it the difficult\nquotations which are incorrectly given in the MSS. of Saya _n_ a\'s commentary\non the Rig-veda. The story of Apala, quoted by Saya _n_ a in his commentary on\nthe Rig-veda, VIII, 80, as from the _S_ a _t_ yayanaka, is found word for\nword, except some trivial var. lectiones, in sections 220-221 of the Agnish\n_t_ oma book of the Talavakara-brahma _n_ a. The _S_ a _t_ yayanins seem to be\nclosely connected with the Talavakara- _s_ akha.\'\n\nFrom a communication made by Dr. Burnell to the Academy (1 Feb. 79), I gather\nthat this Talavakara-brahma _n_ a is called by those who study it \' _G_\naiminiya-brahma _n_ a,\' after the _S_ akha of the Sama-veda which they follow.\nThe account given in the Academy differs on some particulars slightly from\nthat given in Dr. Burnell\'s letter to me. He writes: \'The largest part of the\nBrahma _n_ a treats of the sacrifices and the Samans used at them. The first\nchapter is on the Agnihotra, and the Agnish _t_ oma and other rites follow at\ngreat length. Then comes a book termed Upanishad-brahma _n_ a. This contains\n145 sections in four chapters. It begins with speculations on the Gayatra-\nsaman,\n\np. xci\n\nfollowed by a Va _m_ sa; next, some similar matter and another Va _m_ sa. Then\n(\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 135-138) comes the Kena-upanishad (Talavakara). The last book is the\n\xc3\x82rsheya. The Upanishad forms the tenth anuvaka of the fourth chapter, not the\nbeginning of a ninth chapter, as _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara remarks.\'\n\nThe Kena-upanishad has been frequently published and translated. It forms part\nof Dara Shukoh\'s Persian, and Anquetil Duperron\'s Latin translations. It was\nseveral times published in English by Rammohun Roy (Translations of Several\nPrincipal Books, Passages, and Texts of the Veda, London, 1832, p. 41), in\nGerman by Windischmann, Poley, and others. It has been more or less fully\ndiscussed by Colebrooke, Windischmann, Poley, Weber, Roer, Gough, and Regnaud\nin the books mentioned before,\n\nBesides the text of this Upanishad contained in the Brahma _n_ a of the Sama-\nveda, there is another text, slightly differing, belonging to the Atharva-\nveda, and there are commentaries on both texts (Colebrooke, Misc. Essays,\n1873, II, p. 80).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lxxxix:1](sbe01018.htm#fr_53) See before, p. lxxxiii.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III. The Aitareya-\xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka](sbe01019.htm)\n\n'
