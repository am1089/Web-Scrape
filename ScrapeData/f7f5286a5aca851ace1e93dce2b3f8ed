(With Va _g_. S. XXII, 2,) \'This rope did they\ntake, at the first age of the truth, [the sages, at the rites: it hath been\nwith us at this Soma-sacrifice, declaring the course in the gaining of the\ntruth],\' he takes the halter of the horse in order to supply a formula for the\nsuccess of the sacrifice. It (the rope) is twelve cubits long,--twelve months\nmake a year: it is the year, the sacrifice 1, he secures.\n\n13:1:2:22\\. Concerning this they say, \'Is the rope to be made twelve cubits\nlong, or thirteen cubits long?\' Well, that year is the bull among the seasons,\nand the thirteenth (or intercalary) month is an excrescence of the year; and\nthis A _s_ vamedha is the bull among sacrifices; and inasmuch as the bull has\nan excrescence (hump), one may add on a thirteenth cubit to the rope as an\nexcrescence to this (A _s_ vamedha): even as the bull\'s hump is attached 2 (to\nhis back), suchlike would this be.\n\n13:1:2:33\\. [He puts the halter on the horse, with Va _g_. S. XXII, 3, 4,]\n\'Encompassing 3 thou art,\'--\n\np. 277\n\ntherefore the offerer of the A _s_ vamedha conquers all the quarters 1;--\'the\nworld thou art,\'--the world he thus conquers;--\'a ruler thou art, an\nupholder,\'--he thus makes him a ruler and upholder;--\'go thou unto Agni Vai\n_s_ vanara,\'--he thus makes him go to Agni Vai _s_ vanara (the friend of all\nmen);--\'of wide extent,\'--he thus causes him to extend in offspring and\ncattle;--\'consecrated by Svaha (hail!),\'--this is the Vasha _t_ -call 2 for\nit;--\'good speed (to) thee for the gods!\'--he thus makes it of good speed for\nthe gods;--\'for Pra _g_ apati,\'--the horse is sacred to Pra _g_ apati: he thus\nsupplies 3 it with his own deity.\n\n13:1:2:44\\. But, verily, he who fetters the horse without announcing it to the\nBrahman and the gods is liable to incur injury. He addresses the Brahman (the\nsuperintending priest) by saying, \'O Brahman, I will fetter the horse for the\ngods, for Pra _g_ apati: may I prosper therewith!\' and having made the\nannouncement\n\np. 278\n\nto the Brahman, he ties up the horse, and thus incurs no injury. \'Fetter it\nfor the gods, for Pra _g_ apati: prosper thou therewith!\' thus the Brahman\nurges him, and supplies it (the horse) with its own deity. He then sprinkles\nit (with water): the (symbolic) meaning of this is the same as before 1.\n\n13:1:2:55\\. He sprinkles 2 it, with (Va _g_. S. XXII, 5), \'I sprinkle thee (so\nas to be) acceptable to Pra _g_ apati,\'--for Pra _g_ apati is the most\nvigorous of the gods: it is vigour he bestows on it, whence the horse is the\nmost vigorous of animals.\n\n13:1:2:66\\. \'I sprinkle thee, acceptable to Indra and Agni,\'--for Indra and\nAgni are the most powerful of the gods: it is power he bestows on it, whence\nthe horse is the most powerful of animals.\n\n13:1:2:77\\. \'I sprinkle thee, acceptable to Vayu,\'--for Vayu is the swiftest\nof gods: it is speed he bestows on it, whence the horse is the swiftest of\nanimals.\n\n13:1:2:88\\. \'I sprinkle thee, acceptable to the All-gods,\'--for the All-gods\nare the most famous of gods: it is fame he bestows on it, whence the horse is\nthe most famous of animals,---\'I sprinkle thee, acceptable to all the gods.\'\n\n13:1:2:99\\. Concerning this they say, \'Seeing that the horse is sacred to Pra\n_g_ apati, wherefore (does he say), "I sprinkle thee" for other deities also?\'\nWell, all the gods are concerned in the horse-sacrifice;\n\np. 279\n\nwhen he says, \'I sprinkle thee for all the gods,\' he makes all the gods take a\nconcern in the horse-sacrifice; whence all the gods are concerned in the\nhorse-sacrifice. But his wicked enemy seeks to lay hold of him who performs\nthe horse-sacrifice, and the horse is a thunderbolt;--having killed the four-\neyed dog, he--with \'Undone 1 is the man! undone is the dog!\'--plunges 2 it\nunder the horse\'s feet: it is by means of the thunderbolt\n\np. 280\n\nhe thus stamps him down; and the wicked enemy does not lay hold of him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[276:1](sbe44075.htm#fr_691) Or, possibly, it is for the space of a year that\nhe secures the sacrifice, but see part iv, introduction, p. xxiii.\n\n[276:2](sbe44075.htm#fr_692) Lit., spread out.\n\n[276:3](sbe44075.htm#fr_693) Some such meaning as this (or perhaps\n\'encompassed, encircled\') seems to be assigned by the author to \'abhidha _h_\n,\' with evident reference to \'abhidhani,\' halter,\' from \'abhi-dha,\' \'to\nfasten, enclose.\' The St. Petersburg Dict., on the other hand, takes it in the\nsense of \'naming, denoting\' (? inasmuch as the horse gives the name to the\nhorse-sacrifice); whilst Mahidhara explains it by \'that which is named or\npraised.\'\n\n[277:1](sbe44075.htm#fr_694) In epic times the A _s_ vamedha is commonly\nperformed by kings who have been successful in the \'digvi _g_ aya,\' or\nconquest in all quarters.\n\n[277:2](sbe44075.htm#fr_695) \'Vasha _t_ \' is the sacrificial call uttered by\nthe Hot _ri_ at the end of the \'ya _g_ ya,\' or offering-verse of a regular\noblation (ahuti) as distinguished from minor libations, such as homas and\nagharas, which require no \'ya _g_ ya\' and for which the sacrificial call--\nmarking the pouring out of the libation into the fire--is \'svaha!\' The meaning\nof \'vasha _t_ \' is doubtful; but it would seem to be connected either with the\nroot \'vaksh,\' to grow, to wax, or with \'vah,\' to bear; and would thus mean\neither \'may it prosper!\' or \'may he (Agni) bear it (to the gods)!\' By the\nmention of the Svaha in our formula the horse is, as it were, marked as\ndedicated to the gods.\n\n[277:3](sbe44075.htm#fr_696) Or, perhaps, he causes it to succeed by means, or\nwith the help, of its own deity.\n\n[278:1](sbe44075.htm#fr_697) For the sprinkling of (the material for)\noblations see I, 1, 3, 6 seq.; and an animal victim in particular, III, 7, 4,\n3.\n\n[278:2](sbe44075.htm#fr_698) According to Katy. XX, 1, 37, he goes with the\nhorse to stagnant water, and there sprinkles it. It would seem that the horse\nstands in the water during this ceremony.\n\n[279:1](sbe44075.htm#fr_699) Mahidhara explains \'para _h_ \' by \'parabhuta _h_\n, adhaspada _m_ nita _h_ ,\' i.e. defeated, laid low. Perhaps it may mean,\n\'Away is the man, away the dog!\' As given in the Va _g_. Sa _m_ h., this is\nonly the last part of the formula, pronounced by the Sacrificer; whilst during\nthe killing of the dog, he is made to say, \'Whosoever seeketh to slay the\nsteed, him Varu _n_ a besetteth.\'--According to Katy. XX, 1, 38 seqq., the\npriest says to an \xc3\x82yogava (the offspring of a _S_ udra father and a Vai _s_ ya\nmother)--or, to a lewd man, according to others--\'Kill the four-eyed dog!\'\nwhereupon the man kills a dog by means of a club of Sidhraka wood; and (the\npriest?), by means of a rattan hoop (? or mat, ka _t_ a, comm. ka _t_ aka),\nmakes the dead dog float beneath the horse. According to the comment. on Katy.\nXX, 1, 38, in case a four-eyed dog--i.e. a (two-faced) one \'yasya dve mukhe\'\nand hence looking in the four (intermediate) directions (vidi _s_ ), Say.--is\nnot available (!), a dog with marks about the eyes should be used. The mention\nof the \'four-footed\' dog in the formula is, however, doubtless meant merely\nsymbolically, as representing evil threatening the Sacrificer from every\nquarter.\n\n[279:2](sbe44075.htm#fr_700) Harisvamin seems to connect this with the\nsprinkling of the horse itself--proksha _n_ a _m_ _s_ una upaplavanam u _k_\nyate--perhaps in the sense that the water flowing down from the sprinkled\nhorse would soak the dog, in which case the horse would apparently be supposed\nto stand on the dry ground. See, however, comm. on Katy. XX, 2, 2, \' _S_ vanam\na _s_ vasyadha _h_ prade _s_ e _g_ alamadhye plavayati tarayati.\' The\n\'offerings of drops\' to be performed immediately after this ceremony might\nseem to be offered with reference to the drops of water flowing from the\nhorse, and as it were falling outside the sacrifice; but see [paragraph\n5](sbe44075.htm#13:1:2:5).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 1, 3.
