I will now relate the history of\nSoodama how he went to Krishnu, and his poverty was put an end to; do you\nlisten with attention: in the direction of the southern quarter is the Dravis\ncountry, where brahmins and traders dwelt as kings, under whose government\nadoration and remembrance, and meditation upon Huri were practised in each\nhouse; and all men performed penance and sacrifice; and respected religion and\noffered gifts; and reverenced virtuous and holy men and cows, and brahmins,\nthus they all dwelt there, thinking of none but Huri. In that country was a\nbrahmin, named Soodama, who had been instructed by the same spiritual\npreceptor as Shree Krishnu Chund, very humble, emaciated and poor, so that\nthere was no thatch upon his hut, and he had nothing to eat, One day Soodama\'s\nwife being greatly frightened and grieved at their poverty, went to her\nhusband in a state of alarm, and said trembling, "O great king! we are greatly\ntroubled by this state of poverty; if you wish to put an end to it, I will\npoint out a plan of doing so." The brahmin asked, "What plan?" She replied,\n"Shree Krishnu. Chund, the root of joy, lord of the three worlds, and an\ninhabitant of Dwarka is your chief friend, if you go to him our poverty will\ndepart,\n\np. 398\n\nbecause he is the bestower of wealth, virtue, desires and final happiness."\n\nO great king! when the brahmin\'s wife had thus explained to her husband,\nSoodama said, "O beloved! even Shree Krishnu Chund does not give any one any\nthing, without that person giving him something first, I know well, that\nduring my whole life, I have not given any thing to any one and without having\ngiven, whence shall I receive? I will, however, go as you suggest and come\nback after seeing Shree Krishnu Jee." On hearing these words the brahmin\'s\nwife tied up a little rice in an old white cloth and brought it and gave it to\nher husband as a present for Krishnu and placed before him a string, a brass\npot and a staff. Then Soodama having cast the string and the brass pot upon\nhis shoulders and placed the bundle of rice under his arm, taking the staff in\nhis hand, set out for the city of Dwarka, having propitiated Guneshu and\nmeditating upon Shree Krishnu Chund Jee.\n\nO great king! going along the road, Soodama began to say to himself, "I am\ncertainly not destined to be rich; but, by going to Dwarka, I shall see Shree\nKrishnu Chund, the root of joy." With these thoughts in his mind Soodama\narrived at the city of Dwarka after a journey of less than nine hours, and\nthere beheld a city, surrounded on all sites by the sea. All round the city\nwere forests and groves, producing flowers and fruits. At the ponds, pools and\nlarge wells of masonry, wheels and leather buckets were in full play, herds of\ncows were grazing in different places, and the cowherds\' children, who\naccompanied them, were engaged apart in sports.\n\nHaving recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! Soodama,\nhaving beheld the beauty of the forests and groves, went into the city, and\nsaw very elegant houses of gold, covered with jewels, shining in full\nsplendour. At the different places of meeting, the descendants of Judoo were\nseated, forming courts like that of Indru: in the markets, roads and cross-\nroads, things of different kinds were sold; in each house,\n\np. 399\n\nand in various places, songs were sung, and gifts and adoration offered in\nhonour of Huri, and Krishnu\'s praises were celebrated; and the inhabitants of\nthe whole city were highly delighted. O great king! beholding all these\nsights, and making enquiries for the abode of Shree Krishnu Chund, Soodama\nwent and stood at the great entrance gate of Krishnu\'s house; and timidly\nenquired from some one where Shree Krishnu Chund lived. The man replied, "O\ndivinity! go inside the house, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee is seated opposite on a\njewelled throne."\n\nWhen, O great king! Soodama, having heard this went inside, Shree Krishnu\nChund, on seeing him, descended from his throne; and, advancing to meet him,\nseized his hand with the greatest affection, and led him in; having then\nplaced him upon his throne, he washed his feet, and took the water, with which\nhis feet had been washed; after this, smearing his body with sandal, putting\nunbroken rice upon his forehead, and decorating him with flowers, placing\nperfumes and lamps before him, Krishnu performed adoration to Soodama; having\ndone so the lord of the Judoos joined his hands, and made kind enquiries\nregarding his health, &c., &c.\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja,--O great king! on beholding this behaviour on the part of Krishnu, Shree\nRookmunee Jee and the seven queens, and the sixteen thousand eight hundred\nwives and all the descendants of Judoo, who were then present, began to say to\nthemselves, "What virtuous act has this poor, weak, dirty, shabbily dressed\nbrahmin done in a former birth, that the lord of the three worlds has treated\nhim with such great respect?"\n\nO great king! Shree Krishnu Chund, acquainted with the secrets of the heart,\nknowing the thoughts of them all at that time, began in order to remove the\nperplexities of their minds, to talk to Soodama upon subjects, connected with\ntheir spiritual\n\np. 400\n\npreceptor\'s house, "Brother! do you recollect one day, when the preceptor\'s\nwife sent you and me to bring wood; and when we had brought the wood from the\nforest, and fastening the bundles on our heads went home, there was a storm\nand rain; and it rained very heavily, wet and dry places were inundated with\nwater; I and you got wet, and suffered great annoyance, and remained in the\ncold all night under a tree; early in the morning, the divine preceptor came\nto search for us in the forest; and with the greatest kindness, and giving us\nhis blessing took us both with him to his house." Shree Krishnu Chund Jee\nafter this again said Brother! from the time you quitted our divine spiritual\npreceptor\'s house, I have not received any tidings of you, where you were, and\nwhat you were doing; by coming now and showing yourself, you have made me very\nhappy, and have purified my house." Soodama replied, "O sea of compassion and\nbrother of the poor! O master! acquainted with the secrets of the heart, you\nknow every thing; there is nothing in the world, which is concealed from you."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXXI](psa82.htm)\n\n'
