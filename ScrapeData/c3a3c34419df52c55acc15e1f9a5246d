SUGRIVA.\n\nOver the mighty leaders of the Monkey army associated with R\xc4\x81ma in the\ndestruction of R\xc4\x81vana was King\n\n[![SUGRIVA.](tn/39400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/39400.jpg)  \nSUGRIVA.  \n\n[paragraph continues] Sugriva. When Vishnu, before leaving heaven to become\nincarnate as R\xc4\x81ma, asked the gods to--\n\np. 395\n\n"Make helps, in war to lend him aid,  \n In forms that change at will arrayed,  \n Of wizard skill and hero might,  \n Outstrippers of the wind in flight," *\n\nthey consented, and "begot in countless swarms brave sons disguised in sylvan\nforms." Of Sugriva it is said--\n\n               "That noblest fire,  \nThe Sun, was great Sugriva\'s sire." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nWhen R\xc4\x81ma finds this King of the Monkeys, he was an exile, having been driven\nfrom his throne by his brother B\xc4\x81li. Kabandha, a giant slain by R\xc4\x81ma, gives\nthe following description of the king to the wandering hero:--\n\n"O R\xc4\x81ma, hear my words and seek  \n Sugriva, for of him I speak.  \n His brother B\xc4\x81li, Indra\'s son,  \n Expelled him, when the fight he won.  \n With four great chieftains, faithful still,  \n He dwells on Rishyanuka\'s hill.  \n      *       *       *       *  \n Lord of the V\xc4\x81nars, just and true,  \n Strong, very glorious, bright to view,  \n Unmatched in counsel, firm and meek,  \n Bound by each word his lips may speak,  \n Good, splendid, mighty, bold and brave,  \n Wise in each plan to guide and save.  \n His brother, fired by lust of sway,  \n Drove forth the king in woods to stray;  \n In all thy search for Sit\xc4\x81, he  \n Thy ready friend and help will be." \xe2\x80\xa1\n\nR\xc4\x81ma discovers his retreat, hears the story of his wrongs, promises to slay\n[B\xc4\x81li](errata.htm#2), the usurper, and assist Sugriva to regain his throne;\nSugriva on his part\n\np. 396\n\nsolemnly promises to aid R\xc4\x81ma in his search and to enable him to release Sit\xc4\x81\nfrom R\xc4\x81vana\'s bonds. R\xc4\x81ma very soon fulfils his part of the compact. He\nmarches with Sugriva and the others to B\xc4\x81li\'s city; Sugriva challenges\n[B\xc4\x81li](errata.htm#3) to fight, and just as he is getting the worst of it, R\xc4\x81ma\nlets fly his arrow, which gives B\xc4\x81li his mortal wound. Ere this chief dies, he\nstrongly reproves R\xc4\x81ma for slaying one who had never harmed him and for\nslaying him too in a secret and cowardly manner. He asks--\n\n"What fame, from one thon hast not slain  \n In front of battle, canst thou gain,  \n Whose secret hand has laid me low,  \n When madly fighting with my foe?  \n      *       *       *       *  \n I held that thou wouldst surely scorn  \n To strike me as I fought my foe,  \n And thought not of a stranger\'s blow.  \n But now thine evil heart is shown,  \n A yawning well, with grass o\'ergrown.  \n Thou wearest virtue\'s badge, * but guile  \n And meanest sin thy soul defile." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nR\xc4\x81ma reminds B\xc4\x81li that Fate had ordained his death, against which it was\nuseless to contend, with which statement B\xc4\x81li agrees, and, withdrawing his\nunkind words, asks for R\xc4\x81ma\'s forgiveness.\n\nOn the death of B\xc4\x81li, Sugriva is again installed as King of the V\xc4\x81nars, and\nR\xc4\x81ma gives him four months for the enjoyment of his long-lost wife and\nkingdom. At its expiration, as Sugriva appeared to be so absorbed with\npleasure as to forget his engagement to assist R\xc4\x81ma, Lakshman reminds him of\nhis duty in no measured terms. At length the order is given to collect the\nforces. An army of monkeys, bears, etc., goes forth in search of Sita,\n\np. 397\n\n[![MONKEYS CONSTRUCTING THE BRIDGE AT LANKA.](tn/39700.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/39700.jpg)  \nMONKEYS CONSTRUCTING THE BRIDGE AT LANKA.  \n\np. 398\n\nwho, it is discovered, is somewhere in the southern district over which\nHanum\xc4\x81n is supposed to rule, who after diligent inquiry learns her\nwhereabouts. The army marches to the seashore; a bridge connecting the island\nof Lanka (Ceylon) with the mainland is erected by Nala, and the attacking army\nsurrounds the city. No sooner were they in sight of the city of the foe than\n\n"Up sprang Sugriva from the ground,  \n And reached the turret at a bound.  \n Unterrified the V\xc4\x81nar stood,  \n And wroth, with wondrous hardihood,  \n The king in bitter words addressed,  \n And thus his scorn and hate expressed:  \n \'King of the giant race, in me  \n The friend and slave of R\xc4\x81ma see.  \n Lord of the world, he gives me power  \n To smite thee in thy fenced tower.\'  \n While through the air his challenge rang,  \n At R\xc4\x81van\'s face the V\xc4\x81nar sprang,  \n Snatched from his head the kingly crown,  \n And dashed it in his fury down.  \n Straight at his foe the giant flew,  \n His mighty arms around him threw,  \n With strength resistless swung him round,  \n And dashed him panting to the ground.  \n Unharmed amid the storm of blows,  \n Swift to his feet Sugriva rose.  \n Again in furious fight they met;  \n With streams of blood their limbs were wet,  \n Each grasping his opponent\'s waist." *\n\n[paragraph continues] They continue to fight with uncertain result until\nR\xc4\x81vana calls to his aid his magical arts--\n\n"But brave Sugriva, swift to know  \n The guileful purpose of his foe,\n\np. 399\n\n[paragraph continues]  Gained with light leap the upper air,  \n And breath, and strength, and spirit there;  \n Then, joyous as for victory won,  \n Returned to Raghu\'s royal son." *\n\nIn the course of the great fight, a giant named Kumbhakarna, a brother of\nR\xc4\x81vana, came forth from the city and did great execution amongst the V\xc4\x81nar\nhost, devouring his victims as fast as they were slain, though they were\nnumbered by thousands. Some idea of the size of this monster may be gained\nfrom the fact that\n\n"There was no respite then, no pause:  \n Fast gaped and closed his hell-like jaws:  \n Yet prisoned in that gloomy cave,  \n Some V\xc4\x81nars still their lives could save;  \n Some through his nostrils found a way,  \n Some through his ears resought the day." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\n[paragraph continues] B\xc4\x81li\'s son Angad tried to rally the V\xc4\x81nar host, but he\nwas soon dashed senseless on the ground." Hanum\xc4\x81n had already been severely\nwounded by the monster. And now he attacks Sugriva, who hurled a hill at him,\nbut\n\n"The giant\'s chest the stroke repelled." \xe2\x80\xa1\n\n[paragraph continues] This compliment the monster returns by throwing his\nspear, which Hanum\xc4\x81n caught as it flew, and broke it across his knee. Then\n\n"At Sugriva\'s head he sent  \n A peak from Lanka\'s mountain rent.  \n The rushing mass no might could stay:  \n Sugriva fell, and senseless lay.  \n The giant stooped his foe to seize,  \n And bore him thence, as bears the breeze  \n A cloud in autumn through the sky." \xc2\xa7\n\np. 400\n\n[paragraph continues] The giant enters Lanka with his captive, and is greatly\nlauded by the people; but his triumph was of short duration, for\n\n"By slow degrees the V\xc4\x81nars\' lord  \n Felt life, and sense, and strength restored.  \n He heard the giant\'s joyful boast:  \n He thought upon his V\xc4\x81nar host.  \n His teeth and feet he fiercely plied,  \n And bit and rent the giant\'s side,  \n Who, mad with pain and smeared with gore,  \n Hurled to the ground the load he bore.  \n Regardless of a storm of blows,  \n Swift to the sky the V\xc4\x81nar rose,  \n Then lightly, like a flying ball,  \n High overleapt the city wall." *\n\nLakshman tried to slay this monster; but it was left for R\xc4\x81ma to finish the\nwork, whose arrows cut off limb after limb, and at last severed head from\nbody. After his death, two brothers, Nikumbha and Kumbha, came forth to do\nbattle for their chief. Sugriva seized Kumbha and hurled him into the sea; on\nhis reaching the shore he struck Sugriva such a blow on his chest that he\nbroke his own wrist with the shock. Sugriva returned the blow by another\nbeneath the neck, which proved fatal. His brother now attacked Sugriva;\n\n"And red with fury flashed his eye.  \n He dashed with mighty sway and swing  \n His axe against the V\xc4\x81nar king;  \n But shattered on that living rock,  \n It split in fragments at the shock.  \n Sugriva, rising to the blow,  \n Raised his huge hand and smote his foe,  \n And in the dust the giant lay,  \n Gasping in blood his soul away." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\np. 401\n\nSugriva and his heroic army continued faithful to their king\'s promise until\nR\xc4\x81ma\'s victory was won, though death had considerably thinned their ranks; but\nthis loss was made good as, in answer to R\xc4\x81ma\'s prayer, Yama gave up the whole\nof the V\xc4\x81nars who had died in the struggle. When R\xc4\x81ma was about to return home\nin the magic car, Sugriva asked that he and the V\xc4\x81nar chiefs might accompany\nhim to his capital. Their request being granted, they took part in the\ninstallation of R\xc4\x81ma as king, and received from that grateful monarch rich\npresents as a reward for their faithful service.\n\n##### 2\\. HANUM\xc4\x80N.\n\nHanum\xc4\x81n, on the whole the most useful of the Monkey leaders of the expedition\nto Ceylon, was the son of V\xc4\x81yu, by a V\xc4\x81nar or monkey mother. "His birth is\nthus described--\n\n"An Apsaras, the fairest found  \n Of nymphs, for heavenly charms renowned,  \n Sweet Punjikasthal\xc4\x81, became  \n A noble V\xc4\x81nar\'s wedded dame.  \n Her heavenly title heard no more,  \n Anjan\xc4\x81 was the name she bore,  \n When, cursed by gods, from heaven she fell,  \n In V\xc4\x81nar form on earth to dwell.  \n     *       *       *       *       *  \n In youthful beauty wondrous fair,  \n A crown of flowers about her hair.  \n In silken robes of richest dye,  \n She roamed the hills that kiss the sky.  \n Once in her tinted garments dressed,  \n She stood upon the mountain crest.  \n The god of wind beside her came,  \n And breathed upon the lovely dame;  \n And as he fanned her robe aside,  \n The wondrous beauty that he eyed,\n\np. 402\n\n In rounded lines of breast and limb,  \n And neck and shoulders, ravished him,  \n And captured by her peerless charms,  \n He strained her in his amorous arms.  \n Then to the eager god she cried,  \n In trembling accents, terrified,  \n \'Whose impious love has wronged a spouse  \n So constant to her nuptial vows?\'\n\n[![HANUMAN.](tn/40200.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/40200.jpg)  \nHANUMAN.  \n\n He heard, and thus his answer made:  \n \'Oh, be not troubled, nor afraid,  \n But trust, and thou shalt know ere long  \n My love has done thee, sweet, no wrong.  \n So strong, and brave, and wise shall be  \n The glorious son I give to thee;  \n Might shall be his, that nought can tire,  \n And limbs to spring as springs his sire.\'\n\np. 403\n\n[paragraph continues]  Thus spoke the god: the conquered dame  \n Rejoiced in heart, nor feared the shame." *\n\nAt length the son was born. When a child, seeing the sun rising, and thinking\nit to be the fruit of a tree, he sprang up three hundred leagues to clutch it.\nOn another occasion Indra let a bolt fly at him which caused him to fall\nviolently on a rock. The fall shattered his cheek, and hence the name Hanum\xc4\x81n,\nthe long-jawed one, was given to him. His father seeing this became angry, and\nthe breezes ceased to blow, until the gods in terror came to appease V\xc4\x81yu:\nBrahm\xc4\x81 promised that this boy should not be slain in battle, and Indra\ndeclared that his bolts should never injure him in the future.\n\nThe Monkey leader rendered most valuable service to R\xc4\x81ma. It was he who\ndiscovered Sita\'s abode, and carried a message to her from R\xc4\x81ma. It was he who\nset fire to Lanka and caused fear to enter the hearts of the R\xc4\x81kshasas\ndwelling there. It was he who bore R\xc4\x81ma on his shoulders as he crossed over\nfrom India to Lanka. Hanum\xc4\x81n thus speaks of his wondrous power:\n\n"Sprung from that glorious Father, I  \n In power and speed with him may vie.  \n A thousand times, with airy leap,  \n Can circle loftiest Meru\'s steep:  \n With my fierce arms can stir the sea  \n Till from their beds the waters flee,  \n And rush at my command to drown  \n This land with grove and tower and town.  \n I through the fields of air can spring  \n Far swifter than the feathered king,  \n And leap before him as he flies  \n On sounding pinions through the skies.  \n I can pursue the Lord of Light  \n Uprising from the eastern height,\n\np. 404\n\n[paragraph continues]  And reach him ere his course be sped,  \n With burning beams engarlanded." *\n\nAll these powers he devoted to the service of R\xc4\x81ma; for, when that hero and\nhis brother were wounded in the fight, and nothing else could restore them,\nHanum\xc4\x81n fled to the Himalayas from Ceylon, and returned almost immediately\nwith the medicinal herbs that grew there, though, on reaching the hills, he\nhad some difficulty \xe2\x80\xa0 in finding them:\n\n"But when he thought to seize the prize,  \n They hid them from his eager eyes.  \n Then to the hill in wrath he spake:  \n Mine arm this day shall vengeance take  \n If thou wilt feel no pity, none,  \n In this great need of Raghu\'s son.\'  \n He ceased: his mighty arms he bent,  \n And from the trembling mountain rent  \n His huge head, with the life it bore,  \n Snakes, elephants, and golden ore.  \n O\'er hill and plain and watery waste  \n His rapid way again he traced,  \n And mid the wondering V\xc4\x81nars laid  \n His burden, through the air conveyed.\n\np. 405\n\n The wondrous herbs\' delightful scent  \n To all the host new vigour lent.  \n Free from all darts, and wounds, and pain,  \n The sons of Raghu lived again;  \n And dead and dying V\xc4\x81nars, healed,  \n Rose vigorous from the battle-field." *\n\n[paragraph continues] Hanum\xc4\x81n is described in the "Uttara K\xc4\x81nda" of the\nR\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana, \xe2\x80\xa0 as a being possessed of great learning. "The chief of the monkeys,\nmeasureless, seeking to acquire grammar, looking up to the sun, bent on\ninquiry, go went from the mountain where the sun rises to that where he sets,\napprehending the mighty collection. The chief of the monkeys is perfect: no\none equals him in the S\xc4\x81stras, in learning, and in ascertaining the sense of\nthe Scriptures. In all sciences, in the rules of austerity, he rivals the\npreceptor of the gods."\n\nR\xc4\x81ma himself thus speaks of Hanum\xc4\x81n\'s knowledge of the Scriptures, when he\ncame to the exile as Sugriva\'s envoy:\n\n        "One whose words so sweetly flow,  \n The whole Rig-Veda needs must know,  \n And in his well-trained memory store  \n The Yajush and the S\xc4\x81man\'s lore.  \n He must have bent his faithful ear  \n All grammar\'s varied rules to hear.  \n For his long speech how well he spoke!  \n In all its length no rule he broke." \xe2\x80\xa1\n\nTo this day Hanum\xc4\x81n is regarded as divine, and in some parts of India is\nlargely worshipped. Living monkeys are regarded as his representatives: hence\nmany temples swarm with them, and it is regarded a meritorious act to feed\nthem, and a sacrilegious act to injure them.\n\np. 406\n\n##### 3\\. NALA. *\n\nNala, another of the monkey chiefs, was a son of Visvakarma; and as the son of\nthe architect of the gods, the builder of their beautiful cities, and the\nforger of their wonder-working weapons, as might have been expected, his work\nwas of a similar nature to that for which his illustrious parent was\ncelebrated. When the army reached the sea, and the difficulty of crossing to\nLanka presented itself, as R\xc4\x81ma was preparing to shoot one of his mighty\narrows to dry up the ocean, the Sea Deity presented himself, amidst a great\ncommotion of the elements, and thus addressed him:\n\n"Air, ether, fire, earth, water, true  \n To Nature\'s will, their course pursue;  \n And I, as ancient laws ordain,  \n Unfordable must still remain.  \n Yet, Raghu\'s son, my counsel hear:  \n I ne\'er for love, or hope, or fear,  \n Will pile my waters of a heap,  \n And leave a pathway through the deep.  \n Still shall my care for thee provide  \n An easy passage o\'er the tide,  \n And like a city\'s paven street  \n Shall be the road beneath thy feet." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nHis first word of advice was this, that R\xc4\x81ma, instead of shooting at the sea,\nshould direct his arrow towards the North, to destroy a race of demons who\nwere hateful to him, and then he went on to say--\n\n"Now let a wondrous task be done  \n By Nala, Visvakarma\'s son,\n\np. 407\n\n[paragraph continues]  Who, born of one of V\xc4\x81nar race,  \n Inherits by his father\'s grace  \n A share of his celestial art.  \n Call Nala to perform his part,  \n And he, divinely taught and skilled,  \n A bridge athwart the sea shall build." *\n\nNala declares that he has the will and power to accomplish this great and\nnecessary work; and as an encouragement to R\xc4\x81ma to believe that he will\ncomplete it, said--\n\n"My mother, ere she bore her son,  \n This boon from Visvakarma won:  \n \'O Mandar\xc4\xab, this child shall be  \n In skill and glory next to me.\'  \n But why unbidden should I fill  \n Thine ear with praises of my skill?  \n Command the V\xc4\x81nar hosts to lay  \n Foundations for the bridge to-day." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nR\xc4\x81ma trusts Nala\'s skill, and orders the V\xc4\x81nars to bring materials for the\nbridge:\n\n"Up sprang the V\xc4\x81nars from their rest,  \n The mandate of the king obeyed,  \n And sought the forest\'s mighty shade.  \n Uprooted trees to earth they threw,  \n And to the sea the timber drew.  \n      *        *        *        *  \n With mighty engines piles of stone  \n And seated hills were overthrown:  \n Imprisoned waters sprang on high,  \n In rain descending from the sky:  \n And ocean with a roar and swell  \n Heaved wildly when the mountains fell.  \n Then the great bridge of wondrous strength  \n Was built, a hundred leagues in length.  \n Rocks, huge as autumn clouds, bound fast  \n With cordage from the shore, were cast,\n\np. 408\n\n And fragments of each riven hill,  \n And trees whose flowers adorned them still.  \n Wild was the tumult, loud the din,  \n As ponderous rocks went thundering in.  \n Each set of sun, so toiled each crew,  \n Ten leagues and four the structure grew;  \n The labours of the second day  \n Gave twenty more of ready way,  \n And on the fifth, when sank the sun,  \n The whole stupendous work was done.  \n O\'er the broad way the V\xc4\x81nars sped,  \n Nor swayed it with their countless tread." *\n\n##### 4\\. N\xc4\xaaLA.\n\nThis chief is said to have sprung from Agni, and is described as\n\n                     "Bright as flame,  \n Who in his splendour, might, and worth,  \n Surpassed the sire who gave him birth." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThough thus eulogized, no very special feats of his are recorded in the\nR\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana. He held a post of honour as the leader of a division of the army,\nand his special work appears to have been to provide sentries, and generally\nto guard the forces of Sugriva from the sudden attacks of the enemy. As the\nson of Agni he was able to see clearly, and by his watchfulness rendered good\nservice.\n\n##### 5\\. SUSHENA.\n\nVaruna aided R\xc4\x81ma by the gift of this leader, who was the father of T\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81, the\nwife of B\xc4\x81li, Sugriva\'s brother and the usurper of his throne. To him was\n\np. 409\n\ngiven the command of the army of the West. Sugriva, addressing him, said--\n\n"Two hundred thousand of our best  \n With thee, my lord, shall seek the West." *\n\nAfter searching in vain for traces of the missing princess, he and the other\nunsuccessful leaders returned to R\xc4\x81ma and Sugriva, and said--\n\n"On every hill our steps have been,  \n By wood, and cave, and deep ravine;  \n And all the wandering brooks we know,  \n Throughout the land that seaward flow;  \n Our feet by thy command have traced  \n The tangled thicket and the waste,  \n And dens and dingles hard to pass  \n For creeping plants and matted grass." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThough they could not learn the exact spot where Sit\xc4\x81 was hidden, they\ndiscovered that she had been carried towards the South, the quarter under\nHanum\xc4\x81n\'s special charge, and thus considerably narrowed the sphere of the\nquest. In the great encounter with the foe, Sushena did good service; for when\nR\xc4\x81ma and Lakshman were overcome by Indrajit\'s magical noose, Sugriva and his\ncomrades were greatly distressed. The V\xc4\x81nar king, however, being aware that\nGaruda could release them from the spell by which they were bound, told\nSushena, when they regained their strength and senses, to fly with them to\nKishkindha hermitage, where they could dwell in safety, whilst he himself\nfought against R\xc4\x81vana, and rescued the royal lady. Then Sushena, as the\nphysician, said--\n\n                      "Hear me yet:  \nWhen gods and fiends in battle met,\n\np. 410\n\n[paragraph continues]  So fiercely fought the demon crew,  \n So wild a storm of arrows flew,  \n That heavenly warriors, faint with pain,  \n Sank smitten by the ceaseless rain.  \n Vrihaspati, with herb and spell,  \n Cured the sore wounds of those who fell,  \n And, skilled in arts that heal and save,  \n New life and sense and vigour gave.  \n Far, on the milky ocean\'s shore,  \n Still grow those herbs in boundless store;  \n Let swiftest V\xc4\x81nars thither speed  \n And bring them for our utmost need.  \n Let Panas and Sampati bring,  \n For well the wondrous leaves they know  \n That heal each wound and life bestow.  \n Beside that sea, which, churned of yore,  \n The Amrit on its surface bore,  \n Where the white billows lash the land,  \n Chandra\'s fair height and Drona stand.  \n Planted by gods, each glittering steep  \n Looks down upon the milky deep.  \n Let fleet Hanum\xc4\x81n bring us thence,  \n Those herbs of wondrous influence." *\n\nThese plants were brought by Hanum\xc4\x81n; the wounded recovered, and fought with\nrenewed vigour.\n\n![](img/41000.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[395:*](hmvp40.htm#fr_362) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," i. 92.\n\n[395:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp40.htm#fr_363) Ibid., i. 93.\n\n[395:\xe2\x80\xa1](hmvp40.htm#fr_364) Ibid., iii. 337.\n\n[396:*](hmvp40.htm#fr_365) The dress of a hermit.\n\n[396:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp40.htm#fr_366) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," iv. 91.\n\n[398:*](hmvp40.htm#fr_367) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," v. 121.\n\n[399:*](hmvp40.htm#fr_368) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," v. 122.\n\n[399:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp40.htm#fr_369) Ibid., v. 197.\n\n[399:\xe2\x80\xa1](hmvp40.htm#fr_370) Ibid., v. 198.\n\n[399:\xc2\xa7](hmvp40.htm#fr_371) Ibid., v. 199.\n\n[400:*](hmvp40.htm#fr_372) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," v. 199.\n\n[400:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp40.htm#fr_373) Ibid., v. 229.\n\n[403:*](hmvp40.htm#fr_374) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," iv. 272.\n\n[404:*](hmvp40.htm#fr_375) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," iv. 275.\n\n[404:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp40.htm#fr_376) In seeking for these leaves, Hanum\xc4\x81n was exposed to\nconsiderable danger. K\xc4\x81lanemi, an uncle of R\xc4\x81vana, was promised the half of\nthe kingdom if he would slay Hanum\xc4\x81n. To effect this, he went to the Himalayas\nand, disguised as a devotee, invited Hanum\xc4\x81n to eat with him. Hanum\xc4\x81n refused;\nbut on entering a tank near, a crocodile seized his foot. This reptile Hanum\xc4\x81n\ndragged out of the tank and killed it, from whose body a lovely Apsaras arose,\nwhom Daksha had cursed to live in that form until her release was accomplished\nby Hanum\xc4\x81n. This nymph, in gratitude for his kindness, warned Hanum\xc4\x81n of his\ndanger. The monkey god went to K\xc4\x81lanemi, and telling him that he saw through\nhis disguise, took him by the feet, and whirled him through the air to Lanka,\nwhere he fell before the throne in R\xc4\x81vana\'s palace.\n\n[405:*](hmvp40.htm#fr_377) Griffiths\'s "R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," iv. 225.\n\n[405:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp40.htm#fr_378) Muir, O.
