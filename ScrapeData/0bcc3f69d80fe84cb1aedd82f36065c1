In him who is senseless (in a swoon, &c.)\n\np. 150\n\nthere is half-union; on account of this remaining (as the only possible\nhypothesis).\n\nThere now arises the question of what kind that state is which ordinarily is\ncalled a swoon or being stunned. Here the purvapakshin maintains that we know\nonly of three states of the soul as long as it abides in a body, viz. the\nwaking state, dreaming, and deep dreamless sleep; to which may be added, as a\nfourth state, the soul's passing out of the body. A fifth state is known\nneither from _S_ ruti nor Sm _ri_ ti; hence what is called fainting must be\none of the four states mentioned.--To this we make the following reply. In the\nfirst place a man lying in a swoon cannot be said to be awake; for he does not\nperceive external objects by means of his senses.--But, it might be objected,\nmay not his case be analogous to that of the arrow-maker? Just as the man\nworking at an arrow, although awake, is so intent on his arrow that he sees\nnothing else; so the man also who is stunned, e.g. by a blow, may be awake,\nbut as his mind is concentrated on the sensation of pain caused by the blow of\nthe club, he may not at the time perceive anything else.--No, we reply, the\ncase is different, on account of the absence of consciousness. The arrow-maker\nsays, 'For such a length of time I was aware of nothing but the arrow;' the\nman, on the other hand, who returns to consciousness from a swoon, says, 'For\nsuch a length of time I was shut up in blind darkness; I was conscious of\nnothing.'--A waking man, moreover, however much his mind may be concentrated\non one object, keeps his body upright; while the body of a swooning person\nfalls prostrate on the ground. Hence a man in a swoon is not awake.--Nor, in\nthe second place, is he dreaming; because he is altogether unconscious.--Nor,\nin the third place, is he dead; for he continues to breathe and to be warm.\nWhen a man has become senseless and people are in doubt whether he be alive or\ndead, they touch the region of his heart, in order to ascertain whether warmth\ncontinues in his body or not, and put their hands to his nostrils to ascertain\nwhether breathing goes on or not. If, then, they perceive\n\np. 151\n\nneither warmth nor breath, they conclude that he is dead, and carry off his\nbody into the forest in order to burn it; if, on the other hand, they do\nperceive warmth and breath, they decide that he is not dead, and begin to\nsprinkle him with cold water so that he may recover consciousness.--That a man\nwho has swooned away is not dead follows, moreover, from the fact of his\nrising again (to conscious life); for from Yama's realm none ever return.--Let\nus then say that a man who has swooned lies in deep sleep, as he is\nunconscious, and, at the same time, not dead!--No, we reply; this also is\nimpossible, on account of the different characteristics of the two states. A\nman who has become senseless does sometimes not breathe for a long time; his\nbody trembles; his face has a frightful expression; his eyes are staring wide\nopen. The countenance of a sleeping person, on the other hand, is peaceful, he\ndraws his breath at regular intervals; his eyes are closed, his body does not\ntremble. A sleeping person again may be waked by a gentle stroking with the\nhand; a person lying in a swoon not even by a blow with a club. Moreover,\nsenselessness and sleep have different causes; the former is produced by a\nblow on the head with a club or the like, the latter by weariness. Nor,\nfinally, is it the common opinion that stunned or swooning people are asleep.\n--It thus remains for us to assume that the state of senselessness (in\nswooning, &c.) is a half-union (or half-coincidence) 1, as it coincides in so\nfar as it is an unconscious state and does not coincide in so far as it has\ndifferent characteristics.--But how can absence of consciousness in a swoon,\n&c., be called half-coincidence (with deep sleep)? With regard to deep sleep\nscripture says, 'He becomes united with the True' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 1); 'Then\na thief is not a thief (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 22); 'Day and night do not pass\nthat bank, nor old age, death, and grief, neither good nor evil deeds' ( _Kh_.\nUp. VIII, 4, 1). For the good and evil deeds reach the soul in that way that\nthere arise in it the ideas of being affected by pleasure or pain. Those ideas\nare absent in deep sleep, but\n\np. 152\n\nthey are likewise absent in the case of a person lying in a swoon; hence we\nmust maintain that, on account of the cessation of the limiting adjuncts, in\nthe case of a senseless person as well as of one asleep, complete union takes\nplace, not only half-union.--To this we make the following reply.--We do not\nmean to say that in the case of a man who lies in a swoon the soul becomes\nhalf united with Brahman; but rather that senselessness belongs with one half\nto the side of deep sleep, with the other half to the side of the other state\n(i.e. death). In how far it is equal and not equal to sleep has already been\nshown. It belongs to death in so far as it is the door of death. If there\nremains (unrequited) work of the soul, speech and mind return (to the\nsenseless person); if no work remains, breath and warmth depart from him.\nTherefore those who know Brahman declare a swoon and the like to be a half-\nunion.--The objection that no fifth state is commonly acknowledged, is without\nmuch weight; for as that state occurs occasionally only it may not be\ngenerally known. All the same it is known from ordinary experience as well as\nfrom the ayurveda (medicine). That it is not considered a separate fifth state\nis due to its being avowedly compounded of other states.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[151:1](sbe38113.htm#fr_111) Viz. with deep sleep, as will be explained below.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 11](sbe38114.htm)\n\n"
