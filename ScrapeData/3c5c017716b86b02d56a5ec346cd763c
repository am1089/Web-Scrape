 \nThen quickly vanishing from view  \nEach to his proper home withdrew.  \nThen Rama's face his rapture showed,  \nAnd his full heart with joy o'erflowed,  \nWhile, as the sages parted thence,  \nHe paid his humble reverence.  \n\nThen Bharat shook in every limb  \nAs suppliant thus he spake to him:  \n'The duty of a king respect,  \nHeld by our race in high respect:  \nAnd O, thy gracious ear incline  \nTo heed my mother's prayer and mine.  \nThe mighty realm to rule and guard  \nFor me alone is task too hard.  \nNo power have I the love to gain  \nOf noble, citizen, and swain.  \nAll those who know thee, warrior, friend,  \nOn thee their eager glances bend,  \nAs labouring hinds who till the plain  \nLook fondly for the Lord of Rain.  \nO wisest Prince, thy realm secure,  \nAnd make its firm foundations sure.  \nKakutstha's son, thy mighty arm  \nCan keep the nation free from harm.'  \nHe spoke, and fell in sorrow drowned  \nAt Rama's feet upon the ground,  \nAnd there the hero sued and sighed,  \nAnd 'Hear me, Raghu's son,' he cried.  \n\nThen Rama raised him up, and pressed  \nHis brother to his loving breast,  \nAnd sweetly as a wild swan cried  \nTo Bharat dark and lotus-eyed:  \n\n'So just and true thy generous soul,  \nThy hand may well this earth control:  \nBut many a sage his aid will lend.  \nWith counsellor, and peer, and friend:  \nWith these advise: their counsel ask,  \nAnd so perform thy arduous task.  \nThe moon his beauty may forgo,  \nThe cold forsake the Hills of Snow,  \nAnd Ocean o'er his banks may sweep,  \nBut I my father's word will keep.  \nNow whether love of thee or greed  \nThy mother led to plan the deed,  \nForth from thy breast the memory throw,  \nAnd filial love and reverence show.'  \nThus spake Kaus'alya's son: again  \nBharat replied in humble strain  \nTo him who matched the sun in might  \nAnd lovely as the young moon's light:  \n'Put, noble brother, I entreat,  \nThese sandals on thy blessed feet:  \nThese, lord of men, with gold bedecked,  \nThe realm and people will protect.'  \n\nThen Rama, as his brother prayed  \nBeneath his feet the sandals laid,  \nAnd these with fond affection gave  \nTo Bharat's hand, the good and brave.  \nThen Bharat bowed his reverent head  \nAnd thus again to Rama said:  \n'Through fourteen seasons will I wear  \nThe hermit's dress and matted hair:  \nWith fruit and roots my life sustain,  \nAnd still beyond the realm remain,  \nLonging for thee to come again.  \nThe rule and all affairs of state  \nI to these shoes will delegate.  \nAnd if, O tamer of thy foes,  \nWhen fourteen years have reached their close,  \nI see thee not that day return,  \nThe kindled fire my frame shall burn.  \n\nThen Rama to his bosom drew  \nDear Bharat and S'atrughna too:  \n'Be never wroth,' he cried, 'with her,  \nKaikeyi's guardian minister:  \nThis, glory of Ikshvaku's line,  \nIs Sita's earnest prayer and mine.'  \nHe spoke, and as the big tears fell,  \nTo his dear brother bade farewell.  \nRound Rama, Bharat strong and bold  \n     In humble reverence paced,  \n   When the bright sandals wrought with gold  \n     Above his brows were placed.  \n   The royal elephant who led  \n     The glorious pomp he found,  \n   And on the monster's mighty head  \n     Those sandals duly bound.  \n   Then noble Rama, born to swell  \n     The glories of his race,  \n   To all in order bade farewell  \n     With love and tender grace--  \n   To brothers, counsellers, and peers,--  \n     Still firm, in duty proved,  \n   Firm, as the Lord of Snow uprears  \n     His mountains unremoved.  \n   No queen, for choking sobs and sighs,  \n     Could say her last adieu:  \n   Then Rama bowed, with flooded eyes,  \n     And to his cot withdrew.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[221:1b](ry190.htm#fr_395) Ten-headed, ten-necked, ten faced, are common\nepithets of Ravan the great king of Lanka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto CXIII.: Bharat's Beturn.](ry191.htm)\n\n"
