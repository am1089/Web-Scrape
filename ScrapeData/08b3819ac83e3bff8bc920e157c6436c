He had also an only son called Prince Majnun,\nwho was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red cheeks, red\nhair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond of playing with the Wazir\'s\nson, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal\'s garden, which was very large and full of\ndelicious fruits and flowers and frees. They used to take their little knives\nthere and cut the fruits and eat them. King Dantal had a teacher for them to\nteach them to read and write.\n\nOne day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said to his\nfather, "Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt." His father said\nthey might go, so they got ready their horses and all else they wanted for\ntheir hunting, and went to the Phalana country, hunting all the way, but they\nonly found jackals and birds.\n\nThe Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a daughter\nnamed Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and black hair.\n\nOne night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father\'s kingdom, as she\nslept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man who told her that she\nshould marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and that this was Khuda\'s command\nto her. When Laili woke she told her father of the angel\'s visit to her as she\nslept; but her father paid no attention to her story. From that time she began\nrepeating, "Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun," and would say nothing else. Even\nas she sat and ate her food she kept saying, "Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."\nHer father used to get quite vexed with her. "Who is this Majnun? who ever\nheard of this Majnun?" he would say.\n\n"He is the man I am to marry," said Laili. "Khuda has ordered me to marry no\none but Majnun." And she was half mad.\n\nMeanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana country; and\nas they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to eat the air, and\nrode behind them. All the time she kept saying, "Majnun, Majnun; I want\nMajnun." The prince heard her, and turned round. "Who is calling me?" he\nasked. At this Laili looked at him, and the moment she saw him she fell deeply\nin love with him, and she said to herself, "I am sure that is the Prince\nMajnun that Khuda says I am to marry." And she went home to her father and\nsaid, "Father, I wish to marry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I\nknow he is the Prince Majnun I am to marry."\n\n"Very well, you shall have him for your husband," said Munsuk Raja. "We will\nask him tomorrow." Laili consented to wait, although she was very impatient.\nAs it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom that night, and when Laili\nheard he was gone, she went quite mad. She would not listen to a word her\nfather, or her mother, or her servants said to her, but went off into the\njungle, and wandered from jungle to jungle, till she got farther and farther\naway from her own country. All the time she. kept saying, "Majnun, Majnun; I\nwant Majnun;" and so she wandered about for twelve years.\n\nAt the end of the twelve years she met a fakir--he was really an angel, but\nshe did not know this--who asked her, "Why do you always say, \'Majnun, Majnun;\nI want Majnun?" She answered, "I am the daughter of the king of the Phalana\ncountry, and I want to find Prince Majnun; tell me where his kingdom is."\n\n"I think you will never get there," said the fakir, "for, it is very far from\nhence, and you have to cross many rivers to reach it." But Laili said she did\nnot care; she must see Prince Majnun. "Well," said the fakir, "when you come\nto the Bhagirathi river you will see a big fish, a Rohu; and you must get him\nto carry you to Prince Majnun\'s country, or you will never reach it."\n\nShe went on and on, and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river. There was a\ngreat big fish called the Rohu fish. It was yawning just as she got up to it,\nand she instantly jumped down its throat into its stomach. All the time she\nkept saying, "Majnun, Majnun!" At this the Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and\nswam down the river as fast as he could. By degrees he got tired and went\nslower, and a crow came and perched on his back, and said " Caw, caw." "Oh,\nMr. Crow," said the poor fish, "do see what is in my stomach that makes such a\nnoise."\n\n"Very well," said the crow, "open your mouth wide, and I\'ll fly down and see."\nSo the Rohu opened his jaws and the crow flew down, but he came up again very\nquickly. "You have a Rakshas in your stomach," said the crow, and he flew\naway. This news did not comfort the poor Rohu, and he swam on and on till he\ncame to Prince Majnun\'s country. There he stopped. And a jackal came down to\nthe river to drink. "Oh, jackal," said the Rohu, "do tell me what I have\ninside me."\n\n"How can I tell?" said the jackal. "I cannot see unless I go inside you." So\nthe Rohu opened his mouth wide; and the jackal jumped down his throat; but he\ncame up very quickly, looking much frightened and saying, "You have a Rakshas\nin your stomach, and if I don\'t run away quickly, I am afraid it will eat me."\nSo off he ran. After the jackal came an enormous snake. "Oh," says the fish,\n"do tell me what I have in my stomach, for it rattles about so, and keeps\nsaying, "Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."\n\nThe snake said, "Open your mouth wide, and I\'ll go down and see what it is."\nThe snake went down: when he returned he said, "You have a Rakshas in your\nstomach, but if you will let me cut you open, it will come out of you." "If\nyou do that, I shall die," said the Rohu. "Oh no," said the snake, "you will\nnot, for I will give you a medicine that will make you quite well again." So\nthe fish agreed, and the snake got a, knife and cut him open, and out jumped\nLaili.\n\nShe was now very old. Twelve years she had wandered about the jungle, and for\ntwelve years she had lived inside her Rohu; and she was no longer beautiful,\nand had lost her teeth. The snake took her on his back and carried her into\nthe country, and there he put her down, and she wandered on and on till she\ngot to Majnun\'s court-house, where King Majnun was sitting. There some men\nheard her crying, "Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun," and they asked her what she\nwanted. "I want King Majnun," she said.\n\nSo they went in and said to Prince Majnun, "An old woman outside says she\nwants you." "I cannot leave this place," said he; "send her in here." They\nbrought her in and the prince asked what she wanted. "I want to marry you,"\nshe answered. "Twenty-four years ago you came to my father the Phalana Raja\'s\ncountry, and I wanted to marry you then; but you went away without marrying\nme. Then I went mad, and I have wandered about all these years looking for\nyou." Prince Majnun said, "Very good."\n\n"Pray to Khuda," said Laili, "to make us both young again, and then we shall\nbe married." So the prince prayed to Khuda, and Khuda said to him, "Touch\nLaili\'s clothes and they will catch fire, and when they are on fire she and\nyou will become young again." When he touched Laili\'s clothes they caught\nfire, and she and he became young again. And there were great feasts, and they\nwere married, and travelled to the Phalana country to see her father and\nmother.\n\n[![](tn/30.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/30.jpg)\n\nNow Laili\'s father and mother had wept so much for their daughter that they\nhad become quite blind, and her father kept always repeating, "Laili, Laili,\nLaili." When Laili saw their blindness, she prayed to Khuda to restore their\nsight to them, which he did. As soon as the father and mother saw Laili, they\nhugged her and kissed her, and then they had the wedding all over again amid\ngreat rejoicings. Prince Majnun and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife\nfor three years, and then they returned to King Dantal, and lived happily for\nsome time with him.\n\nThey used to go out hunting, and they often went from country to country to\neat the air and amuse themselves.\n\nOne day Prince Majnun said to Laili, "Let us go through this jungle." "No,\nno," said Laili; "if we go through this jungle, some harm will happen to me."\nBut Prince Majnun laughed, and went into the jungle. And as they were going\nthrough it, Khuda thought, "I should like to know how much Prince Majnun loves\nhis wife. Would he be very sorry if she died? And would he many another wife?\nI will see." So he sent one of his angels in the form of a fakir into the\njungle; and the angel went up to Laili, and threw some powder in her face, and\ninstantly she fell to the ground a heap of ashes.\n\nPrince Majnun was in great sorrow and grief when he saw his dear Laili turned\ninto a little heap of ashes; and he went straight home to his father, and for\na long, long time he would not be comforted. After a great many years he grew\nmore cheerful and happy, and began to go again into his father\'s beautiful\ngarden with Husain Mahamat. King Dantal wished his son to marry again. "I will\nonly have Laili for my wife; I will not marry any other woman," said Prince\nMajnun.\n\n" How can you marry Laili? Laili is dead. She will never come back to you,"\nsaid the father.\n\n"Then I\'ll not have any wife at all?\' said Prince Majnun.\n\nMeanwhile Laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left her a\nlittle heap of ashes. As soon as Majnun had gone, the fakir had taken her\nashes and made them quite clean, and then he had mixed clay and water with the\nashes, and made the figure of a woman with \'them, and so Laili regained her\nhuman form, and Khuda sent life into it. But Laili had become once more a\nhideous old woman, with a long, long nose, and teeth like tusks; just such an\nold woman, excepting her teeth, as she had been when she came out of the Rohu\nfish; and she lived in the jungle, and neither ate nor drank, and she kept on\nsaying, "Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."\n\nAt last the angel who had, come as a fakir and thrown the powder at her, said\nto Khuda, "Of what use is it that this woman should sit in the jungle crying;\ncrying for ever, \'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,\' and eating and drinking\nnothing? Let me take her to Prince Majnun." "Well," said Khuda, "you may do\nso; but tell her that she must not speak to Majnun if he is afraid of her when\nhe sees her; and that if he is afraid when he sees her, she will become a\nlittle white dog the next day. Then she must go to the palace, and she will\nonly regain her human shape when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her with his\nown food, and lets her sleep in his bed."\n\nSo the angel came to Laili again as a fakir and carried her to King Dantal\'s\ngarden. "Now," he said, "it is Khuda\'s command that you stay here till Prince\nMajnun comes to walk in the garden, and then you may show yourself to him. But\nyou must not speak to him, if he is afraid of you; and should he be afraid of\nyou, you will the next day become a little white dog." He then told her what\nshe must do as a little dog to regain her human form.\n\nLaili stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass, till Prince Majnun and\nHusain Mahamat came to walk in the garden. King Dantal was now a very old man,\nand Husain Mahamat, though he was really only as old as Prince Majnun, looked\na great deal older than the prince, who had been made quite young again when\nhe married Laili.\n\nAs Prince Majnun and the Wazir\'s son walked in the garden, they gathered the\nfruit as they had done as little children, only they bit the fruit with their\nteeth; they did not cut it. While Majnun was busy eating a fruit in this way,\nand was talking to Husain Mahamat, he turned towards him and saw Laili walking\nbehind the Wazir\'s son.\n\n"Oh, look, look!" he cried, "see what is following you; it is a Rakshas or a\ndemon, and I am sure it is going to eat us." Laili looked at him beseechingly\nwith all her eyes, and trembling with age and eagerness; but this only\nfrightened Majnun the more. "It is a Rakshas, a Rakshas!" he cried, and he ran\nquickly to the palace with the Wazir\'s son; and as they ran away, Laili\ndisappeared into the jungle. They ran to King Dantal, and Majnun told him\nthere was a Rakshas or a demon in the garden that had come to eat them.\n\n"What nonsense!" said his father. "Fancy two grown men being so frightened by\nan old ayah or a fakir! And if it had been a Rakshas, it would not have eaten\nyou." Indeed King Dantal did not believe Majnun had seen anything at all, till\nHusain Mahamat said the prince was speaking the exact truth. They had the\ngarden searched for the terrible old woman, but found nothing, and King Dantal\ntold his son be was very silly to be so much frightened. However, Prince\nMajnun would not walk in the garden any more.\n\nThe next day Laili turned into a pretty little dog; and in this shape she came\ninto the palace, where Prince Majnun soon became very fond of her. She\nfollowed him everywhere, went with him when he was out hunting, and helped him\nto catch his game, and Prince Majnun fed her with milk, or bread, or anything\nelse be was eating, and at night the little dog slept in his bed.\n\nBut one night the little dog disappeared, and in its stead there lay the\nlittle old woman who had frightened him so much in the garden; and now Prince\nMajnun was quite sure she was a Rakshas, or a demon, or some such horrible\nthing come to eat him; and in his terror be cried out, "What do you want? Oh,\ndo not eat me; do not eat me!" Poor Laili answered, "Don\'t you know me? I am\nyour wife Laili, and I want to marry you. Don\'t you remember how you would go\nthrough that jungle, though I begged and begged you not to go, for I told you\nthat harm would happen to me, and then a fakir came and threw powder in my\nface, and I became a heap of ashes. But Khuda gave me my life again, and\nbrought me here, after I had stayed a long, long while in the jungle crying\nfor you, and now I am obliged to be a little dog; but if you will marry me, I\nshall not be a little, dog any more." Majnun, however, said, "How can I marry\nan old woman like you? how can you be Laili? I am sure you are a Rakshas or a\ndemon come to eat me," and he was in great terror.\n\nIn the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog, and the prince\nwent to his father and told him all that had happened. "An old woman! an old\nwoman! always an old woman!" said his father. "You do nothing but think of old\nwomen. How can a strong man like you be so easily frightened?" However, when\nhe saw that his son was really in great terror, and that he really believed\nthe old woman would come back at night, he advised him to say to her, "I will\nmarry you if you can make yourself a young girl again. How can I marry such an\nold woman as you are?"\n\nThat night as he lay trembling in bed the little old woman lay there in place\nof the dog, crying; " Majnun, Majnun, I want to marry you. I have loved you\nall these long, long years. When I was in my father\'s kingdom a young girl, I\nknew of you, though you knew nothing of me, and we should have been married\nthen if you had not gone away so suddenly, and for long, long years I followed\nyou." "Well," said Majnun, "if you can make yourself a young girl again, I\nwill marry you."\n\nLaili said, "Oh, that is quite easy. Khuda will make me a young girl again. In\ntwo days\' time you must go into the garden, and there you will, see a\nbeautiful fruit. You must gather it and bring it into your room and cut it\nopen yourself very gently, and you must not open it when your father or\nanybody else is with you, but when you are quite alone; for I shall be in the\nfruit quite naked, without any clothes at all on." In the morning Laili took\nher little dog\'s form and disappeared in the garden.\n\nPrince Majnun told all this to his father, who told him to do all the old\nwoman had bidden him. In two days\' time he and the Wazir\'s son walked in the\ngarden, and there they saw a large, lovely red fruit. "Oh!" said the prince,\n"I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit." Husain Mahamat wanted him to\ngather it and see, but he would not till he had told his father, who said,\n"That must be the fruit; go and gather it." So Majnun went back and broke the\nfruit off its stalk; and he said to his father, "Come with me to my room while\nI open it; I am afraid to open it alone, for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas in\nit that will eat me."\n\n"No," said King Dantal; "remember, Laili will be naked; you must go alone and\ndo not be afraid if, after all, a Rakshas is in the fruit, for I will stay\noutside the door, and you have only to call me with a loud voice, and I will\ncome to you, so the Raksbas will not be able to eat you."\n\nThen Majnun took the fruit and began to cut it open tremblingly, for he shook\nwith fear; and when he had cut it, out stepped Laili, young and far more\nbeautiful than she had ever been. At the sight of her extreme beauty, Majnun\nfell backwards fainting on the floor.\n\nLaili took off his turban and wound it all round herself like a sari (for she\nhad no clothes at all on), and then she called King Dantal, and said to him\nsadly, "Why has Majnun fallen down like this? Why will he not speak to me? He\nnever used to be afraid of me; and he has seen me so many, many times."\n\nKing Dantal answered, "It is because you are so beautiful. You are far, far\nmore beautiful than you ever were. But he will be very happy directly." Then\nthe King got some water, and they bathed Majnun\'s face and gave him some to\ndrink, and he sat up again.\n\nThen Laili said, "Why did you faint? Did you not see I am Laili?"\n\n"Oh!" said Prince Majnun, "I see you are Laili come back to me, but your eyes\nhave grown so wonderfully beautiful that I fainted when I saw them." Then they\nwere all very happy, and King Dantal had all the drums in the place beaten,\nand had all the musical instruments played on, and they made a grand wedding\nfeast, and gave presents to the servants, and rice and quantities of rupees to\nthe fakirs.\n\nAfter some time had passed very happily, Prince Majnun and his wife went out\nto eat the air. They rode on the same horse, and had only a groom with them.\nThey came to another kingdom, to a beautiful garden. "We must go into that\ngarden and see it," said Majnun.\n\n"No, no," said Laili; "it belongs to a bad Raja, Chumman Basa, a very wicked\nman." But Majnun insisted on going in, and in spite of all Laili could say, he\ngot off the horse to look at the flowers. Now, as he was looking at the\nflowers, Laili saw Chumman Basa coming towards them, and she read in his eyes\nthat he meant to kill her husband and seize her. So she said to Majnun, "Come,\ncome, let us go; do not go near that bad man. I see in his eyes, and I feel in\nmy heart, that he will kill you to seize me."\n\n"What nonsense!" said Majnun. "I believe be is a very good Raja. Anyhow, I am\nso near to him that I could not get away."\n\n"Well," said Laili, "it is better that you should be killed than I, for if I\nwere to be killed a second time, Khuda would not give me my life again; but I\ncan bring you to life if you are killed." Now Chumman Basa had come quite\nnear, and seemed very pleasant, so thought Prince Majnun; but when he was\nspeaking to Majnun, he drew his scimitar and cut off the prince\'s head at one\nblow.\n\nLaili sat quite still on her horse, and as the Raja came towards her she said,\n"Why did you kill my husband?"\n\n"Because I want to take you," he answered.\n\n"You cannot," said Laili.\n\n"Yes, I can," said the Raja.\n\n"Take me then," said Laili to Chumman Basa; so he came quite close and put out\nhis hand to take hers to lift her off her horse. But she put her hand in her\npocket and pulled out a tiny knife, only as long as her hand was broad, and\nthis knife unfolded itself in one instant till it was such a length! and then\nLaili made a great sweep with her arm and her long, long knife, and off came\nChumman Basa\'s head at one touch.\n\nThen Laili slipped down off her horse, and she went to Majnun\'s dead body, and\nshe cut her little finger inside her hand straight down from the top of her\nnail to her palm, and out of this gushed blood like healing medicine. Then she\nput Majnun\'s head on his shoulders, and smeared her healing blood all over the\nwound, and Majnun woke up and said, What a delightful sleep I have had! Why, I\nfeel as if I had slept for years!" Then he got up and saw the Raja\'s dead body\nby Laili\'s horse.\n\n"What\'s that?" said Majnun.\n\n"That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me, just as I said he would."\n\n"Who killed him?" asked Majnun.\n\n"I did," answered Laili, "and it was I who brought you to life."\n\n"Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so," said Majnun.\n\n"No," said Laili, "for. he is a wicked man, and will try to do you harm." But\nMajnun asked her for such a long time, and so earnestly, to bring the wicked\nRaja to life, that at last she said, "Jump up on the horse, then, and go far\naway with the groom."\n\n"What will you do," said Majnun, "if I leave you? I cannot leave you."\n\n"I will take care of myself," said Laili; "but this man is so wicked, he may\nkill you again if you are near him." So Majnun got up on the horse, and he and\nthe groom went a long way off and waited for Laili. Then she set the wicked\nRaja\'s head straight on his shoulders, and she squeezed the wound in her\nfinger till a little blood-medicine came out of it. Then she smeared this over\nthe place where her knife had passed, and just as she saw the Raja opening his\neyes, she began to run, and she ran, and ran so fast, that she outran the\nRaja, who tried to catch her; and she sprang up on the horse behind her\nhusband, and they rode so fast, so fast, till they reached King Dantal\'s\npalace.\n\nThere Prince Majnun told everything to his father, who was horrified and\nangry. "How lucky for you that you have such a wife," he said. "Why did you\nnot do what she told you? But for her, you would be now dead." Then he made a\ngreat feast out of gratitude for his son\'s safety, and gave many, many rupees\nto the fakirs. And he made so much of Laili. He loved her dearly; he could not\ndo enough for her. Then he built a splendid palace for her and his son, with a\ngreat deal of ground about it, and lovely gardens, and gave them great wealth,\nand heaps of servants to wait on them. But he would not allow any but their\nservants to enter their gardens and palace, and he would not allow Majnun to\ngo out of them, nor Laili; "for," said King Dantal, "Laili is so beautiful,\nthat perhaps some one may kill my son to take her away."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Tiger, The Brahman, and the Jackal](ift10.htm)\n\n'
