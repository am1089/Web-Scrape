The After Life.--I. _Upanishads._ --Good deeds are requited, according\nto the Veda, in another world, the heaven of the gods and the fathers. The\nBr\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as regard the heaven of the gods as a place of recompense for the good,\nand the abode of the fathers as a hell in which men are reborn to lives of\nsuffering proportioned to their sins in this world. Finally we meet the\n\np. 53\n\ndoctrine of transmigration definitively set forth in the Upanishads, by which\nretribution is effected, in part at any rate, by rebirth in this world.\n\nThe fullest eschatological scheme in the Upanishads is given in the parallel\npassages Ch. V. iii.-x., B.A. VI. ii. The first half of these sections (Ch. V.\niii.-ix., B.A. VI. ii. 1-14) sets forth the theory that on death the soul goes\nto heaven in a sublimated form, here allegorically styled "waters" and "faith"\n(a conception in which are united the two ideas of "subtle body" and "works"),\nand from heaven returns at once to earthly birth, being sacrificed by the gods\nsuccessively in the fires of heaven, the atmosphere, earth, man, and woman.\nHere there is no idea of requital in any world but this. The further\nparagraphs expound a more complicated theory of requital both in the other\nworld and here. The souls of the sages who "worship Faith as their\nmortification in the woods" (they who have the saving knowledge) ascend by a\nseries of stages which lead to the sun, thence to the moon, thence to the\nlightning, and thence to Brahma, the "supreme light," from which they never\nreturn. This is the "Way of the Gods," _deva-y \xc4\x81na._ The souls of those who do\npious works in the village (but have not won full enlightenment and withdrawn\nfrom the world) rise by the "Way of the Fathers," _pitri-y \xc4\x81na,_ which leads\nfinally to the moon, where in the company of the gods they enjoy the full\nrecompense\n\np. 54\n\nof their good deeds; after this they pass down to honourable rebirth on earth\nthrough successive stages (ether, wind, smoke, mist, cloud, rain, vegetation,\nfood, and seed). The sinful, according to Ch. V. x. 7, have also a\nproportionate share in the joys of the moon, and are afterwards reborn in the\nforms of base animals or equally degraded races of men; according to B.A. this\nrebirth is immediate. On the other hand the famous passage B.A. IV. iv. 2-6\nknows only of rebirth in recompense.\n\nII. _Later Ved \xc4\x81nta._--\xc5\x9aankara\'s system in the main follows these doctrines.\nHe holds that the truly enlightened become immediately one with Brahma (\xc2\xa7 24).\nBut those souls which are bound in the empirical world must accordingly pass\nthrough empirical spheres of recompense. They who have the lower or exoteric\nknowledge and worship the "qualified Brahma" (\xc2\xa7 12) pass through the "Way of\nthe Gods" to the paradise called the "world of Brahma"; here according to\ntheir merits they either gain by degrees the saving knowledge which transports\nthem for ever to the Absolute Brahma _(krama-mukti)_ , or else they have due\nenjoyment of heavenly bliss until their "works" have shrunk to a residue _(anu\n\xc5\x9baya)_, whereupon they descend to honourable earthly incarnations. They who\nhave done pious works travel by the "Way of the Fathers" to the moon, where\nthey share the pleasures of paradise\n\np. 55\n\nwith the gods, and thence in due time return to earth. Those who have neither\nknowledge nor good works pass to hell, there to expiate their sins in part\nbefore rebirth in lower forms; and besides hell \xc5\x9aankara, following the obscure\nwords of the Ch., admits a "third place" of punishment, viz. rebirth as the\nlowest and most ephemeral animals (on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra, III. i. 8 f.).\n\nWhen men of inferior knowledge or good works die, their sense-functions are\nmerged into the _manas, manas_ into "breaths," "breaths" into the individual\nsoul, which together with the "subtle body" passes into the heart, of which\nthe peak is now lit up (B.A. IV. iv. 2); thence the soul of the man of lower\nknowledge travels out by the _sushumn \xc4\x81_ (an imaginary vein leading to the top\nof the head) by the road of the sun\'s rays (Ch. VIII. vi. 5), to the "Way of\nthe Gods," but that of the man of good works issues by way of the other 100\nchief veins of the body into the "Way of the Fathers" (on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra IV. ii.\n17 f.). On IV. iii. 1 f. \xc5\x9aankara endeavours to reconcile the discrepant lists\nof the stations in the "Way of the Gods" given in Ch. IV. xv. 5, V. x. 1, B.A.\nVI. ii. 15, and Kau. I. iii., and points out that by their names are to be\nunderstood their presiding deities. As regards the road of return to rebirth,\nhe follows Ch. V. x. 5 f. and B.A. VI. ii. 16 (on III. i. 22 f.).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I. Creation](brk29.htm)\n\n'
