No,  \nForth to the forest will I go.  \n'Tis Fate, Sumitras son, confess,  \nThat sends me to the wilderness.  \n'Tis Fate alone that gives away  \nTo'other hands the royal sway  \nHow could Kaikeyi's purpose bring  \nOn me this pain and suffering,  \nWere not her change of heart decreed  \nBy Fate whose will commands the deed?  \nI know my filial love has been  \nThe same throughout for every queen,  \nAnd with the same affection she  \nHas treated both her son and me.  \nHer shameful words of cruel spite  \nTo stay the consecrating rite,  \nAnd drive me banished from the throne,--  \nThese I ascribe to Fate alone,  \nHow could she, born of royal race,  \nWhom nature decks with fairest grace,  \nSpeak like a dame of low degree  \nBefore the king to torture me?  \nBut Fate, which none may comprehend,  \nTo which all life must bow and bend,  \nIn her and me its power has shown,  \nAnd all my hopes are overthrown.  \nWhat man, Sumitra's darling, may  \nContend with Fate's resistless sway,  \nWhose all-commanding power we find  \nOur former deeds alone can bind?  \nOur life and death, our joy and pain,  \nAnger and fear, and loss and gain,  \nEach thing that is, in every state,  \nAll is the work of none but Fate.  \nE'en saints, inspired with rigid zeal.  \nWhen once the stroke of Fate they feel,  \nIn sternest vows no more engage,  \nAnd fall enslaved by love and rage.  \nSo now the sudden stroke whose weight  \nDescends unlooked for, comes of Fate,  \nAnd with unpitying might destroys  \nThe promise of commencing joys.  \nWeigh this true counsel in thy soul:  \nWith thy firm heart thy heart control;  \nThen, brother, thou wilt cease to grieve  \nFor hindered rites which now I leave.  \nSo cast thy needless grief away,  \nAnd strictly my commands obey.  \nThose preparations check with speed,  \nNor let my throning rites proceed.  \nThose urns that stand prepared to shed  \nKing-making drops upon my head,  \nShall, with their pure lustrations now  \nInaugurate my hermit's vow.  \n\np. 121  \n\nYet what have I to do with things  \nThat touch the state and pomp of kings?  \nThese hands of mine shall water take  \nTo sanctify the vow I make.  \nNow Lakshman, let thy heart no more  \nMy fortune changed and lost deplore.  \nA forest life more joys may bring  \nThan those that wait upon a king,  \nNow though her arts successful mar  \n     My consecrating rite,  \n   Let not the youngest queen too far  \n     Thy jealous fear excite.  \n   Nor let one thought suggesting ill  \n     Upon our father fall,  \n   But let thy heart remember still  \n     That Fate is lord of all.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXIII.: Lakshman's Anger.](ry101.htm)\n\n"
