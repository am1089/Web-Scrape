Let an ascetic depart from his house, giving a promise of safety from\ninjury to all animated beings. 1\n\n2\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'That ascetic who wanders\nabout at peace with all creatures, forsooth, has nothing to fear from any\nliving being,' 2\n\n3\\. 'But he who becomes an ascetic and does not promise safety from injury to\nall beings, destroys the born and the unborn; and (so does an ascetic) who\naccepts presents.' 3\n\n4\\. Let him discontinue the performance of all religious ceremonies, but let\nhim never discontinue the recitation of the Veda. By neglecting the Veda he\nbecomes a _S_ udra; therefore he shall not neglect it.' 4\n\n5 '(To pronounce) the one syllable (Om) is the best (mode of reciting the)\nVeda, to suppress the breath is the highest (form of) austerity; (to subsist\non) alms is better than fasting; compassion is preferable to liberality.' 5\n\n6\\. (Let the ascetic) shave (his head); let him have no property and no home.\n6\n\np. 47\n\n7\\. Let him beg food at seven houses which he has not selected (beforehand), 7\n\n8\\. (At the time) when the smoke (of the kitchen-fire) has ceased and the\npestle lies motionless. 8\n\n9\\. Let him wear a single garment, 9\n\n10\\. Or cover his body with a skin or with grass that has been nibbled at by a\ncow.\n\n11\\. Let him sleep on the bare ground.\n\n12\\. Let him frequently change his residence, 12\n\n13\\. (Dwelling) at the extremity of the village, in a temple, or in an empty\nhouse, or at the root of a tree.\n\n14\\. Let him (constantly) seek in his heart the knowledge (of the universal\nsoul). 14\n\n15\\. (An ascetic) who lives constantly in the forest,\n\n16\\. Shall not wander about within sight of the village-cattle.\n\n17\\. 'Freedom from future births is certain for him who constantly dwells in\nthe forest, who has subdued his organs of sensation and action, who has\nrenounced all sensual gratification, whose mind is fixed in meditation on the\nSupreme Spirit, and who is (wholly) indifferent (to pleasure and pain).'\n\n18\\. (Let him) not (wear) any visible mark (of his order), nor (follow) any\nvisible rule of conduct.\n\n19\\. Let him, though not mad, appear like one out of his mind.\n\n20\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'There is no salvation for\nhim who is addicted to 20\n\np. 48\n\nthe pursuit of the science of words, nor for him who rejoices in captivating\nmen, nor for him who is fond of (good) eating and (fine) clothing, nor for him\nwho loves a pleasant dwelling.'\n\n21\\. 'Neither by (explaining) prodigies and omens, nor by skill in astrology\nand palmistry, nor by casuistry and expositions (of the _S_ astras), let him\never seek to obtain alms.' 21\n\n22\\. 'Let him not be dejected when he obtains nothing, nor glad when he\nreceives something. Let him only seek as much as will sustain life, without\ncaring for household property.' 22\n\n23\\. 'But he, forsooth, knows (the' road to) salvation who cares neither for a\nhut, nor for water, nor for clothes, nor for the three Pushkaras' (holy\ntanks), nor for a house, nor for a seat, nor for food.' 23\n\n24\\. In the morning and in the evening he may eat as much (food) as he obtains\nin the house of one Brahma _n_ a, excepting honey and meat, 24\n\n25\\. And he shall not (eat so much that he is quite) satiated. 25\n\n26\\. At his option (an ascetic) may (also) dwell in a village.\n\n27\\. Let him not be crooked (in his ways); (let him) not (observe the rules\nof) impurity on account 27\n\np. 49\n\nof deaths (or births); let him not have a house; let him be of concentrated\nmind.\n\n28\\. Let him not enjoy any object of sensual gratification.\n\n29\\. Let him be (utterly) indifferent, avoiding to do injury or to show\nkindness to any living being.\n\n30\\. To avoid backbiting, jealousy, pride, self-consciousness, unbelief,\ndishonesty, self-praise, blaming others, deceit, covetousness, delusion,\nanger, and envy is considered to be the duty of (men of) all orders. 30\n\n31\\. A Brahma _n_ a who wears the sacred thread, who holds in his hand a gourd\nfilled with water, who is pure and avoids the food of _S_ udras will not fail\n(to gain) the world of Brahman. 31\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[46:1](sbe1413.htm#fr_265) **X**.

It is very probable that the\nsingle garment mentioned in the Sutra is, as K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\nthinks, a small strip of cloth to cover the ascetic's nakedness.\n\n[47:12](sbe1413.htm#fr_274)-13.

Manu VI, 94-95.\n\n[48:27](sbe1413.htm#fr_282) The text is here probably corrupt. But I follow K\n_ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita. Several MSS. read a _s_ a _th_ o, 'he shall not\nbe a rogue,' for a _s_ avo, 'he shall not observe the rules of impurity.'\n\n[49:30](sbe1413.htm#fr_283) Vish _n_ u II, 16-17.\n\n[49:31](sbe1413.htm#fr_284) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita believes that this\nSutra again refers to ascetics. But that is hardly possible, as ascetics are\nnot allowed to wear a sacrificial thread (see above. Sutra 18). I think that\nit is meant to emphatically assert that a Brahma _n_ a who is free from the\nshortcomings enumerated in the preceding Sutra, and who follows the rule of\nconduct, will obtain salvation, whether he passes through the order of Sa _m_\nnyasins or not.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XI](sbe1414.htm)\n\n"
