Agni, have mercy! Thou art great, who hast come to this pious man to sit\ndown on the sacrificial grass.\n\n2\\. He who cannot be deceived, the zealous, the immortal has among men become\nthe messenger of all.\n\n3\\. He, the joy-giving Hot _ri_ , is led around the sacred seat at the heaven-\naspiring sacrifices. And he sits down as the Pot _ri_ also.\n\n4\\. Agni sits down also as (the sacrificer's) wife\n[1](sbe46098.htm#an_4:9:4:1) at the sacrifice, and as the master of the house\nin the house, and as the Brahman [2](sbe46098.htm#an_4:9:4:2).\n\n5\\. Thou zealously approachest as the Upavakt _ri_\n[1](sbe46098.htm#an_4:9:5:1) of the people who perform the sacrificial\nservice, and (thou approachest) the offerings of men.\n\n6\\. And thou zealously performest the messenger-ship for the man in whose\nsacrifice thou takest pleasure, in order to bear the mortal's offering (to the\ngods).\n\n7\\. Find pleasure [1](sbe46098.htm#an_4:9:7:1) in our rites, in our sacrifice,\nO A\xe1\xb9\x85giras. Hear our call!\n\n8\\. May thy unerring chariot, by which thou protectest the worshippers,\nencompass us from every side.\n\np. 349\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse I = SV. I, 23. Verse 8 = VS. III, 36; MS.\nI, 5, 4. 5. 11.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. 'Wir vermuten: utagna agnir adhvare \xe2\x80\xa6 die correctur durfte evident\nsein.' Ludwig. The same conjecture has been proposed already in 1868 by Prof.\nMax Muller (Chips, 2nd ed., vol. iii, p. 157). In my opinion the traditional\ntext is correct.\n\nNote 2. The Brahman very probably is not the Brahman of the later ritual, but\nthe Brahma _n_ a _k_ _kh_ a _m_ sin. See H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 396.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The Upavakt _ri_ is identical with the Pra _s_ ast _ri_ or Maitravaru\n_n_ a of the later ritual. H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 390.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. On _g_ oshi, cf.
