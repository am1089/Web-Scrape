For now the gods, having laid down\nthe first layer, mounted it.\n\np. 23\n\n[paragraph continues] But, indeed, the first layer is this (terrestrial)\nworld: it is this same world which, when completed, they mounted.\n\n8:2:1:22\\. They spake, \'Meditate ye!\'--whereby, doubtless, they meant to say,\n\'Seek ye a layer! Seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!\' Whilst meditating,\nthey saw this second layer: what there is above the earth, and on this side of\nthe atmosphere, that world was to their mind, as it were, unfirm and\nunsettled.\n\n8:2:1:33\\. They said to the A _s_ vins, \'Ye two are Brahmans and physicians:\nlay ye down for us this second layer!\'--\'What will therefrom accrue unto\nus?--\'Ye two shall be the Adhvaryus at this our Agni _k_ itya.\'--\'So be it!\'--\nThe A _s_ vins laid down for them that second layer: whence they say, \'The A\n_s_ vins are the Adhvaryus of the gods.\'\n\n8:2:1:44\\. He lays down (the first \xc3\x82 _s_ vini 1 brick, with\n\np. 24\n\n[paragraph continues] Va _g_. S. XIV, 1), \'Thou art firmly-founded, firmly-\nseated, firm!\' for what is steady and settled, that is firm. Now that world\nwas to their minds, as it were, unfirm and unsettled: having thereby made it\nfirm, steady, they (the A _s_ vins) went on laying down (bricks).--\'Seat thee\nfitly in thy firm seat!\'--that is, \'Seat thee fitly in thy steady\nseat;\'--\'enjoying the first appearance of the Ukhya,\'--the Ukhya, doubtless,\nis this Agni; and that first layer is indeed his first appearance: thus,\n\'enjoying that.\'--\'May the A _s_ vins, the Adhvaryus, settle you here!\' for\nthe A _s_ vins, as Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).\n\np. 25\n\n8:2:1:55\\. [The second \xc3\x82 _s_ vini he lays down, with Va _g_. S. XIV, 2],\n\'Nest-like, fat, wise,\'--a nest, as it were, is indeed the second layer\n1;--\'seat thee in the soft seat of the earth!\'--the second layer, no doubt, is\nthe earth: thus, \'Sit on her pleasant seat!\'--\'May the Rudras, the Vasus sing\nthy praises!\'--that is, \'May those deities sing thy praises!\'--\'Replenish\nthem, O Brahman, for happiness!\'--that is, \'Favour them, O Brahman, with a\nview to happiness.\'--\'May the A _s_ vins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!\'\nfor the A _s_ vins, as Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).\n\n8:2:1:66\\. [The third \xc3\x82 _s_ vini brick he lays down, with Va _g_. S. XIV, 3],\n\'By thine own powers seat thee here, a holder of powers,\'--that is, \'By thy\nown energy seat thee here;\'--\'in the gods\' favour for high joy!\' that is, \'for\nthe favour of the gods, for great joy 2;"--\'be thou kind, as a father to his\nson!\'--that is, \'As a father is gentle, kind, to his son, so be thou\nkind!\'--\'rest thou readily accessible with thy form!\'--the form, doubtless, is\nthe body: thus, \'rest thou with readily accessible body!\'--\'May the A _s_\nvins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!\' for the A _s_ vins, as Adhvaryus, did\nlay down (this brick).\n\np. 26\n\n8:2:1:77\\. [The fourth \xc3\x82 _s_ vini he lays down, with Va _g_. S. XIV, 4], \'Thou\nart the earth\'s soil-cover,\'--the first layer, doubtless, is the earth, and\nthis, the second (layer) is, as it were, its soil-cover (purisha)--\'her sap 1,\nin truth,\'--that is, \'her essence, in truth,\'--\'May the All-gods sing thy\npraises!\'--that is, \'May all the gods sing thy praises!\'--\'Seat thee here,\nladen with stomas, and rich in fat!\'--whatever hymn-forms he will be spreading\n(constructing) thereon by them this (brick) is laden with stomas 2;--\'Gain for\nus by sacrifice wealth (dravi _n_ a, pl.) with offspring (adj. sing.)!\'--that\nis, \'Gain for us, by sacrifice, wealth (dravi _n_ am, sing.) with\noffspring!\'--\'May the A _s_ vins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!\' for the A\n_s_ vins, as Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).\n\n8:2:1:88\\. These (bricks) are those regions (quarters); he places them on the\nrange of the two reta _h_ si _k_ (bricks), for the reta _h_ si _k_ are these\ntwo (worlds): he thereby places the regions within these two (worlds), whence\nthere are regions within these two (worlds). He lays down (these bricks) in\nevery direction: he thus places the regions in all (the four) directions,\nwhence the regions are in all directions. [He places them] on all sides so as\nto face each other 3: he thereby\n\np. 27\n\nmakes the regions on all sides face each other, and hence the regions on all\nsides face each other. He lays (the bricks) down separately, settles them\nseparately, and pronounces the sudadohas over them separately, for separate\nare the regions.\n\n8:2:1:99\\. He then lays down the fifth regional (or \xc3\x82 _s_ vini brick). Now\nthat region is the one above 1; and that same region above, doubtless, is\nyonder sun: it is yonder sun he thus places thereon. He places this (brick)\nwithin the southern regional one 2: he thus places yonder sun within the\nsouthern region, and therefore he moves within the southern region.\n\n8:2:1:1010\\. [He lays it down, with Va _g_. S. XIV, 5], \'I settle thee upon\nthe back of Aditi,\'--Aditi doubtless is this (earth): it is upon her, as a\nfoundation, that he thus founds him (Agni);--\'the holder\n\np. 28\n\nof the air, the supporter of the regions, the ruler of beings,\'--for he (the\nsun) is indeed the holder of the air, the supporter of the regions, and the\nruler of beings;--\'thou art the wave, the drop, of water,\'--the wave,\ndoubtless, means the essence;--\'Vi _s_ vakarman is thy _Ri_ shi!\'--Vi _s_\nvakarman (the all-shaper), doubtless, is Pra _g_ apati: thus, \'Thou art\nfashioned by Pra _g_ apati.\'--\'May the A _s_ vins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee\nhere!\' for the A _s_ vins, as Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).\n\n8:2:1:1111\\. Now as to why he lays down these \xc3\x82 _s_ vini (bricks). When Pra\n_g_ apati had become relaxed (disjointed), the deities took him and went away\nin different directions. Now what part of him there was above the feet and\nbelow the waist, that part of him the two A _s_ vins took and kept going away\nfrom him.\n\n8:2:1:1212\\. He said to them, \'Come to me and restore unto me that wherewith\nye have gone away from me!\'--\'What will accrue to us therefrom?\'--\'That part\nof my body shall be sacred unto you!\'--\'So be it!\' so the A _s_ vins restored\nthat (part) unto him.\n\n8:2:1:1313\\. Now these five \xc3\x82 _s_ vini (bricks) are that same (part) of his\n(Agni\'s) body; and when he now puts them into this (layer of the altar), he\nthereby restores to him what (part) of his body these (bricks) are: that is\nwhy he puts them into this (layer).\n\n8:2:1:1414\\. \'Thou art firmly founded, firmly seated, firm,\' he says, for\nwhatsoever is steady and established that is firm. Now that part of his (Pra\n_g_ apati-Agni\'s) body was, as it were, unsteady, unfirm; and having made it\nsteady and firm they (the A _s_ vins) restored it to him.\n\n8:2:1:1515\\. \'Nestlike, fat, wise,\' he says, for this indeed\n\np. 29\n\nis as a nest for his body.--\'By thine own powers seat thee here, a holder of\npowers,\' he says, for they did make that (part) of him powerful.--\'Thou art\nthe Earth\'s soil-cover,\' he says, for that (lower part) of his body is, as it\nwere, in connection with the soil-cover. At the range of the Reta _h_ si _k_\n(he places the bricks),--the Reta _h_ si _k_ are the ribs, for level with the\nribs, as it were, is that (part) of his body. He places them on every side,\nfor on every side the A _s_ vins restored that (part) of his (Pra _g_ apati\'s)\nbody.\n\n8:2:1:1616\\. He then lays down two Ritavya 1 (seasonal bricks);--these two,\nthe _Ri_ tavya, are the seasons ( _ri_ tu): it is the seasons he thus bestows\nthereon. [He lays them down, with Va _g_. S. XIV, 6], \' _S_ ukra and _S_ u _k_\ni, the two summer-seasons;\'--these are the names of these two: it is with\ntheir names that he thus lays them down. There are two bricks, for a season\nconsists of two months. He settles them once only: he thereby makes (the two\nmonths) one season.\n\n8:2:1:1717\\. And as to why he lays down these two in this (layer):--this Agni\n(fire-altar) is the year, and the year is these worlds. Now that part of him\nwhich is above the earth and below the atmosphere, is this second layer; and\nthat same part of him (Agni, the year,) is the summer season. And when he lays\ndown those two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Agni) that part of\nhis body which these two are: this is why he lays down these two (bricks) in\nthis (layer).\n\np. 30\n\n8:2:1:1818\\. And, again, as to why he lays down these two in this (layer).\nThis fire-altar is Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is the year. Now that\n(part) of him which is above the feet and below the waist is this second\nlayer; and that same part of him is the summer season. Thus when he lays down\nthose two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him that (part) of his body\nwhich these two ale: this is why he lays down these two (bricks) in this\n(layer).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[22:1](sbe4306.htm#fr_74) Viz. in the south-east corner, or on the right\nshoulder, of the altar. From these two lokamp _ri_ _n_ as (or space-fillers)\nhe starts filling up, in two turns, the still available spaces of the \'body\'\nof the altar, as also the whole of the two wings and the tail. For other\nparticulars as to the way in which these are laid down, see [VIII, 7, 2,\n1](sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:1) seqq. The \'body\' of an ordinary altar requires in this\nlayer 1028 lokamp _ri_ _n_ as of three different kinds, viz. a foot (Ind.),\nhalf a foot, and a quarter of a foot square, occupying together a space of 321\nsquare feet, whilst the 98 special (ya _g_ ushmati) bricks fill up a space of\n79 square feet. Each wing requires 309 lokamp _ri_ _n_ as of together 120\nsquare feet; whilst the tail takes 283 such bricks, of together 110 square\nfeet. The total number of lokamp _ri_ _n_ as in the layer thus amounts to 7929\nof all sizes, equal to 671 square feet. If (as is done in Katy. _S_ rautas.\nXVII, 7, 21) the 21 bricks of the Garhapatya (part iii, p. 304) are added to\nthis number, the total number of lokamp _ri_ _n_ as is 1,950. Similarly, in\nthe second, third, and fourth layers; whilst the last layer requires about a\nthousand lokamp _ri_ _n_ as more than any of the others, viz. 2,922, or,\nincluding the special hearths, 3,000. The total number of such bricks required\n--including the 21 of the Garhapatya--amounts to 10,800. Cp. Weber, Ind. Stud.\nXIII, p. 255.\n\n[22:2](sbe4306.htm#fr_75) See [VIII, 7, 2, 1](sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:1) seq.\n\n[22:3](sbe4306.htm#fr_76) See [VIII, 7, 3, 1](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:1) seq.\n\n[23:1](sbe4307.htm#fr_77) The main portion of the special bricks of the second\nlayer consists of five, or (if, for the nonce, we take the two southern sets\nof half-bricks as one) of four sets of four bricks each, or of together\nsixteen bricks, each measuring a foot square, placed on the range of the reta\n_h_ si _k_ bricks so as to form the outer rim of a square measuring five feet\non each side, and having in the middle a blank square of nine square feet.\nEach of the four sides of the reta _h_ si _k_ rim contains a complete set of\nfour bricks; but as there are five bricks on each side, the one in the left-\nhand corner (looking at them from the centre of the square) is counted along\nwith the adjoining set. Each set, proceeding from left to right (that is, in\nsunwise fashion), consists of the following bricks,--a _s_ vini, vai _s_\nvadevi, pra _n_ abh _ri_ t, and apasya, the last of these occupying the corner\nspaces. The southern bricks consist, however, of two sets of half-bricks\n(running with their long sides from west to east), counted as the second and\nfifth set respectively. The eastern and western bricks are laid down so that\ntheir line-marks (which, in the case of the bricks of the second and fourth\nlayers, are of an indefinite number) run from west to east; whilst those of\nthe southern p. 24 and northern ones run from south to north. All the five\nbricks of each class, beginning with the a _s_ vinis, are laid down at the\nsame time, proceeding again in sunwise fashion (east, south, &c.); the\n\n![THE CENTRAL PART OF THE SECOND LAYER.](img/02400.jpg)  \nTHE CENTRAL PART OF THE SECOND LAYER.\n\norder of the procedure being only interrupted by the two Ritavya bricks being\nlaid down, immediately after the placing of the five a _s_ vini, exactly over\nthe two _ri_ tavyas of the first layer, that is to say in the fifth (easterly)\nspace from the centre, north and south of the spine. The only other special\nbricks of the second layer are nineteen vayasyas placed at the four ends of\nthe two spines, viz. four in the east, and five in each of the other quarters.\n\n[25:1](sbe4307.htm#fr_78) This comparison doubtless refers to the way in which\nthe central portion of the special bricks of this layer are arranged so as\ncompletely to enclose an empty space in the middle.. In the first layer there\nwas, no doubt, a similar enclosure of bricks as the reta _h_ si _k_ range, but\nthe central space was not left quite empty. In the end, however, the empty\nspaces are in both cases filled up by \'space-fillers.\'\n\n[25:2](sbe4307.htm#fr_79) The author seems to take \'rasa\' as an adjective (=\nrama _n_ iya), as does Mahidhara, who interprets the formula as meaning \'for\nthe gods\' great, cheerful happiness.\'\n\n[26:1](sbe4307.htm#fr_80) The word \'apsas,\' which western philologists usually\ntake to mean \'cheek,\' is here apparently connected with \'ap,\' water.\n\n[26:2](sbe4307.htm#fr_81) Literally, \'having stomas on her back.\' Mahidhara\ninterprets \'stoma-p _ri_ sh _th_ a\' by \'possessed of stomas and P _ri_ sh _th_\nas.\' Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. S. III, 7, 2, 7, by \'(P _ri_ sh _th_ a-)stotras\nperformed with stomas.\'\n\n[26:3](sbe4307.htm#fr_82) \'Samya _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ \' may either mean \'tending to one and\nthe same point,\' or \'running in the same direction, parallel to each other.\'\nIt is probably in the former sense that we have to take it here, though not\nquite literally, but in so far as the line-marks of these p. 27 bricks, if\ncontinued towards the centre of the altar, intersect one another. As applied\nto the quarters this meaning would then modify itself to that of \'facing each\nother.\' On the other hand, it is quite possible that the meaning of \'tending\nin the same direction\' is the one intended; and it would in that case probably\napply to the fact that the sets opposite to each other have their line-marks\nrunning in the same direction, or are parallel to each other; and this meaning\nwould seem to be implied to the quarters where the author supports his\nargument by the fact that the wind blows, and the rain falls, in the same\ndirection in all the four quarters ([VIII, 2, 3, 2](sbe4309.htm#8:2:3:2);\n[5](sbe4309.htm#8:2:3:5)). It is curious that the expression is used by the\nauthor in connection with the a _s_ vini, pra _n_ abh _ri_ t, and apasya, but\nnot with the vai _s_ vadevi, the line-marks of which all meet in one central\npoint, which is not the case with the others. At [VIII, 3, 1,\n11](sbe4311.htm#8:3:1:11), on the other hand, it is used again in connection\nwith the Di _s_ ya bricks, which, in the third layer, occupy exactly the same\nspaces as the Vai _s_ vadevis do here.\n\n[27:1](sbe4307.htm#fr_83) Or, that direction is the one upward (from here).\n\n[27:2](sbe4307.htm#fr_84) That is to say, he places it immediately north of\nthe southern a _s_ vini, so as to fill up the unoccupied, inner half of the\nspace (of a foot square).\n\n[29:1](sbe4307.htm#fr_85) These two bricks are placed exactly upon the two\n_Ri_ tavyas of the first layer, that is, in the fifth space from the centre;\nsee [p. 1](sbe4303.htm#page_1), note [1](sbe4303.htm#fn_34).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 2, 2.
