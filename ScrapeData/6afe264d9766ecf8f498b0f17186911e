He tried in vain\nto get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he\nfailed.\n\nBy chance a poor Brahman came by.\n\n"Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!" cried the tiger.\n\n"Nay, my friend," replied the Brahman mildly, "you would probably eat me if I\ndid."\n\n"Not at all!" swore the tiger with many oaths; "on the contrary, I should be\nfor ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!"\n\nNow when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious Brahman\'s\nheart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of the cage. Out\npopped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried, "What a fool you are! What\nis to prevent my eating you now, for after being cooped up so long I am just\nterribly hungry!"\n\nIn vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was a promise\nto abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to question as to\nthe justice of the tiger\'s action.\n\nSo the Brahman first asked a _papal-_ tree what it thought of the matter, but\nthe _papal_ -tree replied coldly, "What have you to complain about? Don\'t I\ngive shade and shelter to every one who passes by, and don\'t they in return\ntear down my branches to feed their cattle? Don\'t whimper--be a man!"\n\nThen the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a buffalo\nturning a well-wheel; but he fared no better from it, for it answered, "You\nare a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I gave milk they fed me on\ncotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry they yoke me here, and give me\nrefuse as fodder!"\n\nThe Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion.\n\n"My dear sir," said the road, "how foolish you are to expect anything else!\nHere am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and small,\ntrample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the ashes of their pipes\nand the husks of their grain!"\n\nOn this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a jackal,\nwho called out, "Why, what\'s the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look as miserable as\na fish out of water!"\n\nThe Brahman told him all that had occurred. "How very confusing!" said the\njackal, when the recital was ended; "would you mind telling me over again, for\neverything has got so mixed up?"\n\nThe Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a\ndistracted sort of way, and still could not understand.\n\n"It\'s very odd," said he, sadly, "but it all seems to go in at one ear and out\nat the other! I will go to the place where it all happened, and then perhaps I\nshall be able to give a judgment."\n\nSo they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the Brahman,\nand sharpening his teeth and claws;\n\n"You\'ve been away a long time!" growled the savage beast, "but now let us\nbegin our dinner."\n\n_\n\n"Our_ dinner!" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked together\nwith fright; "what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!"\n\n"Give me five minutes, my lord!" he pleaded, "in order that I may explain\nmatters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits."\n\nThe tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again, not\nmissing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible.\n\n"Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!" cried the jackal, wringing its paws.\n"Let me see! how did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the tiger came\nwalking by--"\n\n"Pooh!" interrupted the tiger, "what a fool you are! _I_ was in the cage."\n\n"Of course! " cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright; "yes! I was\nin the cage--no I wasn\'t--dear! dear! where are my wits? Let me see--the tiger\nwas in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by--no, that\'s not it, either!\nWell, don\'t mind me, but begin your dinner, for I shall never understand!"\n\n"Yes, you shall!" returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal\'s stupidity;\n"I\'ll _make_ you understand! Look here--I am the tiger--"\n\n"Yes, my lord! "\n\n"And that is the Brahman--"\n\n"Yes, my lord!"\n\n"And that is the cage--"\n\n"Yes, my lord!"\n\n"And I was in the cage--do you understand?"\n\n"Yes--no - Please, my lord--"\n\n"Well? " cried the tiger impatiently.\n\n"Please, my lord!--how did you get in?"\n\n"How!--why in the usual way, of course!"\n\n"Oh, dear me!--my head is beginning to whirl again! Please don\'t be angry, my\nlord, but what is the usual way?"\n\nAt this the tiger lost patience, and, jumping into the cage, cried, "This way!\nNow do you understand how it was?"\n\n"Perfectly! " grinned the jackal, as he dexterously shut the door, "and if you\nwill permit me to say so, I think matters will remain as they were!"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Soothsayers Son](ift11.htm)\n\n'
