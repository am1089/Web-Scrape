Janamejaya said :-- O Mahar _s_ i! Who was Satyavrata, the Brahmi _n_\nwhose name you have just taken? In what country was he born? Of what nature\nwas he? Please describe all these to me and satisfy my curiosity?\n\n\n\n2\\. How did he hear that sound \xc2\x93Ai\xc2\x94; how did he repeat that word? How came out\nthe success to him, that illiterate Brahma _n_ , at that very instant?\n\n\n\np. 154\n\n\n\n3\\. And how is it that that Great Goddess, who is omniscient and omnipresent,\nwas pleased with him, kindly describe this interesting incident in detail.\n\n\n\n4\\. Suta said :-- Vyasa, the son of Satyavati, thus asked by the king,\naddressed in the following pure, sweet, and highly liberal words.\n\n\n\n5\\. Vyasa said :-- Hear, O king! You are the best and foremost in the Kuru\nclan; what I before heard in the assembly of the Munis, I am now relating that\nancient story, highly beneficial to you.\n\n\n\n6\\. O best of the Kurus! Once in my peregrinations in the holy places of\npilgrimages, I came to the Naimisaranya forest, that highly sacred place\nfrequented by the Munis.\n\n\n\n7-8. That time there were staying Sanaka, Sanatana and the other sons of\nBrahma who were liberated while living. I went there and bowed down to the\nMunis and took my seat. Then the religious conversations ensued there in the\nassembly, when the great sage Mahar _s_ i Jamadagni began to question the\nMunis in the following terms :--\n\n\n\n9\\. O high-minded excellent ascetics and Munis! There has arisen a great doubt\nin my mind; I am desirous to have that doubt solved in this assembly of the\nMahar _s_ is.\n\n\n\n10-12. O all-knowing Mahar _s_ is that have fulfilled your vows! O Givers of\none's honour! Now my question is this :-- Of the following Devas Brahma, Vi\n_sn_ u, Rudra, Indra, Varu _n_ a, Fire, Kuvera, Wind, Visvakarma, Kartikeya,\nGanesa, the Sun, the two As'vins, Bhaga, Pusa, Moon, and the other planets,\nwho is the first and best to be worshipped, that can easily be served; who is\nvery quickly satisfied and grants the desired boons; kindly tell me this as\nearly as possible.\n\n\n\n13\\. Thus questioned by the Muni Jamadagni, Mahar _s_ i Lomas'a, one in the\nassembly, spoke :-- O Jamadagni! Hear in reply to your question.\n\n\n\n14-15. The Goddess of Energy is the best of the Devas, most excellent and\nhighest to be worshipped. Those who want welfare, they ought to worship this\nSupreme Force. She is the Para Prakriti, the Highest Nature, the Brahma,\nconditioned by Maya (Time, space, and causation). She grants all the desires,\ndoes good to all, pervades everywhere, and is the Mother of Brahma and the\nother high souled Devas. She is the First Prakriti, and is the Root of this\ngigantic Tree of Universe.\n\n\n\n16\\. If any one calls the Devi in remembrance or distinctly utters Her Name,\nShe fulfills all the desires of the human beings. If anybody worships Her, She\nis at once filled with mercy and becomes ready to grant boons.\n\n\n\np. 155\n\n\n\n17\\. O Munis! How, once on a time, at Brahmi _n_ , uttering one letter of Her\nmystical mantra, obtained Her Grace, I am now describing that most auspicious\nhistory before you. Be pleased to hear.\n\n\n\n18\\. Once on a time, there lived in the country of Kosala,* a famous Brahmi\n_n_ , named Deva Datta. He had no issues and therefore started duly according\nto the prescribed rules a sacrifice called Puttre _st_ i for the sake of\nobtaining children.\n\n\n\n*Kosala is a country situated, according to Ramaya _n_ a, along the banks of the Sarayu (or Gogra). It was divided into Uttara-Kosala and Dakshina Kosala. The former is also called Ganda and it must have therefore signified the country, north of Ayodhya comprising Gonda and Bahraich. Aja and Dasaratha, etc., are said to have ruled over the province. At the time of Rama's death, his two sons Kusa and Lava reigned respectively at Kusavati in Southern Kosala in the defiles of the Vindhyas and at Sravasti in northern Kosala.\n\n\n\n19-20. On the banks of the Tamasa river, the Brahmi _n_ erected a temporary\nbuilding (or an open shade) for performing the ceremony, and there built an\naltar and invited the Brahmi _n_ s, versed in the Vedas, and clever in\nperforming sacrificial rites. There he placed the fire and began to perform\naccording to the strict rules, the Puttre _st_ i sacrifice.\n\n\n\n21-22. In that sacrifice, Suhotra, the best of the Munis acted the part of\nBrahma (1); Yaj\xc3\xb1yavalkya acted the part of Adhvaryu (2); Brihaspati, that of\nHota (3); Paila, that of Prastota (4); Govila, that of Udgata (6); and the\nother Munis acted as assistants. These all were duly paid their remunerations.\n\n\n\n(1) One of the four priests employed at a Soma sacrifice as a superintendent.\n\n(2) Any officiating priest technically distinguished from Hotri, Udgatri and\nBrahma _n_. His duty was to measure the ground, build the altar, prepare\nsacrificial vessels, to fetch wood and water, light the fire, bring the animal\nand immolate it and while doing this to repeat the Yajurveda.\n\n(3) A sacrificing priest who offers the oblations. Or one who recites the\nprayers of the Rigveda at a sacrifice.\n\n(5) One of the four principal priests at a sacrifice, one who chants the hymns\nof the Samaveda.\n\n\n\n23-24. The Hota Govila, the excellent reciter of the Sama hymns, began to sing\nin accented tones called svarita (the accents are three Udatta, Anudatta and\nSvarita) and the Rathantara Sama in 7 tunes.\n\n\n\nThen he began to draw breath frequently; and consequently there was a break in\ntime in the accent of Govila. Seeing this, Deva Datta was angry and\nimmediately said to Govila.\n\n\n\np. 156\n\n\n\n25\\. Well, Govila, you are the foremost of the Munis and still you are doing\nyour work like a quite illiterate man. I fear obstacles may arise in the\ngetting of my son in this my sacrifice of Puttre _st_ i.\n\n\n\n26\\. Govila then became much enraged and told Deva Datta \xc2\x93your son will be\nilliterate, hypocrite, and dumb.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n27\\. Behold! Every being is subject to breathing and respiring; it is very\nhard to control them; there is no fault of mine in the accents of my songs\nbeing thus broken; it is strange that you, being intelligent, cannot\nunderstand this.\n\n\n\n28\\. Being afraid to hear the curse from Govila, Deva Datta became very sorry\nand said \xc2\x93O Muni! I have done no serious offence; why are you so offended\nwithout any cause. See! The Munis are void of anger and they always give\ndelight to others.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n29-30. O best of Brahmans! My offence is very trifling; why have you inflicted\non me so severe a curse? I was already under the mental agony, since I had no\nissues; and now you have made me suffer move pain.\n\n\n\n31\\. For the Vedic Pundits declare that it is better not to have any son than\nto have an illiterate stupid son; the more so, when a Brahmi _n_ 's son is\nilliterate, he is blamed by one and all.\n\n\n\n32\\. An illiterate son is like a S\xc2\x92udra or a beast; he is unfit for any\naction. O Brahmin! What shall I do with an illiterate son?\n\n\n\n33\\. An illiterate Brahmi _n_ is like a S\xc2\x92udra; consequently not an object to\nbe engaged in any act of worship or of gifts, he is not deserving to do any\naction.\n\n\n\n34\\. A Brahma _n_ , bereft of the knowledge of the Vedas, living in a country\nis treated as a S\xc2\x92udra by the king of the place and is liable to pay taxes.\n\n\n\n35\\. Whoever wants to have any fruit in any action will never invite an\nilliterate Brahmi _n_ to take his seat in the ceremony relating to the Pitris\nor the Devas.\n\n\n\n36\\. The king will consider an illiterate Brahmin as if a S\xc2\x92udra and will\nnever engage him in any religious ceremony but will order him to do the work\nof a farmer in cultivating fields.\n\n\n\n37\\. Rather to perform the funeral ceremonies by erecting a Kus'aba _t_ a than\nto engage an illiterate Brahmi _n_ for the purpose.\n\n\n\n38\\. One should give food to an illiterate Brahmi _n_ just sufficient to fill\nhis belly and no more. If he does not do that, the giver and especially the\nreceiver are subject to go down to hell.\n\n\n\np. 157\n\n\n\n39\\. Fie to a kingdom where honour is shown to the illiterate stupid Brahma\n_n_ as.\n\n\n\n40\\. Where no difference is observed when seats, worship and gift are given to\nvarious persons, sages should draw their inference how the literate and\nilliterate persons are treated there.\n\n\n\n41\\. When the illiterate fools become haughty, when they are paid honours and\ngifts, the literary persons should never dwell there.\n\n\n\n42\\. The wealth of the wicked goes to the enjoyments of the bad persons; for\nthe Nim trees, though abounding richly in fruits, are enjoyed only by crows.\n\n\n\n43\\. Again, on the other hand, if the Brahmi _n_ s, versed in the Vedas, study\nthe Vedas even after they have taken their food, still his father and\nforefathers are happy and play cheerfully in their heavens.\n\n\n\n44\\. Therefore O Govila! You being the foremost of the Brahmi _n_ who are\nversed in the Vedas, what have you said just now? See in this world, death is\nrather to be preferred then to have an illiterate son. How is it, then, that\nyou have cursed me that I would get an illiterate son, when you are the best\none, highly qualified with knowledge.\n\n\n\n45\\. O high minded one! You are capable to relieve the distressed; I am bowing\ndown to your feet; shew your mercy and re-consider your curse.\n\n\n\n46\\. Lomas'a said :-- O Munis! Devadatta, saying these words, fell prostrate\nat his feet and began to eulogise him in very pitiful words, being very much\ngrieved and with tears in his eyes.\n\n\n\n47\\. Seeing him thus distressed, Govila was moved with pity. The persons that\nare noble have their anger satiated after a short while; the anger of the\nignoble lasts for a long time.\n\n\n\n48\\. The water is naturally cool; but it gets hot in contact with fire heat;\nand no sooner the heat is drawn away, water gets again cooled quickly.\n\n\n\n49\\. The merciful Govila then addressed the distressed Devadatta \xc2\x93your son\nthough at first illiterate, will afterwards be very learned.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n50\\. The Brahmi _n_ Devadatta was very glad on getting this boon; then\ncompleting the sacrifice, rewarded the Brahmi _n_ s with their due dakshi _n_\nas and dismissed them.\n\n\n\n51\\. In due course of time, his fair chaste wife Rohi _n_ i, like the asterism\nRohi _n_ i became pregnant.\n\n\n\n52\\. Devadatta performed the Garbhadhan (1) and Pumsavan (2) ceremonies and\nother purificatory rites duly.\n\n\n\np. 158\n\n\n\n53\\. He performed the Simantonnayana ceremony according to rules and\nconsidered his Puttrve _st_ i sacrifice successful and made various offerings\nto the Brahmi _n_ s.\n\n\n\nN. B. -- (1) One of the Samskaras, purificatory ceremonies, performed after\nmenstruation to ensure or facilitate conception (this ceremony legalises in a\nreligious sense the consummation of marriage).\n\n(2) It is a ceremony performed on a woman's perceiving the first signs of a\nliving conception, with a view to the birth of a son.\n\n(3) \xc2\x93Parting of the hair\xc2\x94 one of the twelve Samskaras or purificatory rites\nobserved by women in the fourth, sixth, or eighth month of their pregnancy.\n\n\n\n54-55. In the auspicious lagna when Rohi _n_ i asterism was present and in the\nauspicious day, his wife Rohi _n_ i gave birth to a male child. Devadatta\nperformed the nativities of the new born child and saw its face. Next that\nknower of the Pura _n_ as, Devadatta kept the name of the child as Utathya.\n\n\n\n56\\. When the son was eight years old, Devadatta performed the Upanayana\n(thread) ceremony duly.\n\n\n\n57-58. Next the child was made to accept the vow of Brahmachari; and Devadatta\nmade him study the Vedas; but the child could not pronounce a single word and\nused to sit simply like a stupid boy. Though tried in various ways to read and\nwrite, that wicked boy never paid the slightest attention, simply sat idly.\nSeeing this, his father was very sorry and much grieved.\n\n\n\n59\\. Thus twelve years passed. Yet the boy could not learn how to perform his\nSandhya Bandana duly.\n\n\n\n60\\. The rumour went abroad that Utathya, the son of Devadatta turned out very\nilliterate. All the Brahma _n_ as, ascetics, and other persons came to learn\nthis fact.\n\n\n\n61\\. Wherever Utathya used to go in any forest on hermitage, the people used\nto laugh at him, ridiculed his father and mother and began to chide that\nilliterate son.\n\n\n\n62\\. Thus blamed by father, mother and all other persons, dispassion occupied\nthe heart of Utathya.\n\n\n\n63\\. Once when rebuked by his father and mother that it was better to have a\nblind and lame son instead of an illiterate brute, Utathya took recourse to\nrenunciation and went to a dense forest.\n\n\n\n64-65. On the banks of the Ganges in a beautiful spot free from obstacles, he\nbuilt a beautiful hut and began to subsist on the roots and\n\n\n\np. 159\n\n\n\nfruits of the forest and with collected mind. Having made the excellent vow \xc2\x93I\nwill never speak untruth\xc2\x94 and holding the vow of celibacy, he lived in that\nbeautiful hermitage.\n\n\n\nThus ends the 10th chapter in the 3rd Skandha of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa relating to the story of Satyavrata.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 11](bk03ch11.htm)\n\n"
