(The beginninglessness of the world; recommends itself to reason and is\nseen (from Scripture).\n\nThe beginninglessness of the world recommends itself to reason. For if it had\na beginning it would follow that, the world springing into existence without a\ncause, the released souls also would again enter into the circle of\ntransmigratory existence; and further, as then there would exist no\ndetermining cause of the unequal dispensation of pleasure and pain, we should\nhave to acquire in the doctrine of rewards and punishments being allotted,\nwithout reference to previous good or bad action. That the Lord is not the\ncause of the inequality, has already been remarked. Nor can Nescience by\nitself be the cause, and it is of a uniform nature. On the other hand,\nNescience may be the cause of inequality, if it be considered as having regard\nto merit accruing from action produced by the mental impressions or wrath,\nhatred, and other afflicting passions 1. Without merit and demerit nobody can\nenter into existence, and again, without a body merit and demerit cannot be\nformed; so that--on the doctrine\n\np. 361\n\nof the world having a beginning-we are led into a logical see-saw. The\nopposite doctrine, on the other hand, explains all matters in a manner\nanalogous to the case of the seed and sprout, so that no difficulty remains.--\nMoreover, the fact of the world being without a beginning, is seen in _S_ ruti\nand Sm _ri_ ti. In the first place, we have the scriptural passage, 'Let me\nenter with this living Self ( _g_ iva), &c. ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 3, 2). Here the\ncircumstance of the embodied Self (the individual soul) being called,\npreviously to creation, 'the living Self'--a name applying to it in so far as\nit is the sustaining principle of the pra _n_ as--shows that this phenomenal\nworld is without a beginning. For if it had a beginning, the pra _n_ as would\nnot exist before that beginning, and how then could the embodied Self be\ndenoted, with reference to the time of the world's beginning, by a name which\ndepends on the existence of those pra _n_ as. Nor can it be said that it is so\ndesignated with a view to its future relation to the pra _n_ as; it being a\nsettled principle that a past relation, as being already existing, is of\ngreater force than a mere future relation.--Moreover, we have the mantra, 'As\nthe creator formerly devised (akalpayat) sun and moon ( _Ri._ Sa _m_ h. X,\n190, 3), which intimates the existence of former Kalpas. Sm _ri_ ti also\ndeclares the world to be without a beginning, 'Neither its form is known here,\nnor its end, nor its beginning, nor its support' (Bha. Gi. XV, 3). And the\nPura _n_ a also declares that there is no measure of the past and the future\nKalpas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[360:1](sbe34175.htm#fr_317) Ragadveshamoha ragadayas te _k_ a purusha _m_\ndukhadibhi _h_ kli _s_ yantiti kle _s_ as tesha _m_ karmaprav _ri_ ttyanugu\n_n_ as tabhir akshipta _m_ dharmadilaksbilaksha _n_ a _m_ karma\ntadapekshavidya. \xc3\x82n.
