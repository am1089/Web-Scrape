The northern progress of the sun is a day, with the gods.\n\n2\\. The southern progress of the sun is (with them) a night.\n\n3\\. A year is (with them) a day and a night;\n\n4\\. Thirty such are a month;\n\n5\\. Twelve such months are a year.\n\n6\\. Twelve hundred years of the gods are a Kaliyuga.\n\n[XX. 1-3. M. I, 67.--6-9. M. I, 69, 70.--10. M. I, 71.--11. M. I, 79.--12-14.\nM. I, 72.--30. Y. III, 11.\n\n6\\. The Kaliyuga itself consists of a thousand years only; but it is both\npreceded and followed by a twilight lasting a hundred years. It is similar\nwith the three other Yugas. (Nand.)]\n\np. 78\n\n7\\. Twice as many (or two thousand four hundred) are a Dvapara (Yuga).\n\nS. Thrice as many (or three thousand six hundred) are a Treta (Yuga).\n\n9\\. Four times as many (or four thousand eight hundred) are a K _ri_ ta Yuga.\n\n10\\. (Thus) twelve thousand years make a _K_ aturyuga (or period of four\nYugas).\n\n11\\. Seventy-one _K_ aturyugas make a Manvantara (or period of a Manu).\n\n12\\. A thousand _K_ aturyugas make a Kalpa.\n\n13\\. And that is a day of the forefather (Brahman).\n\n14\\. His night also has an equal duration.\n\n15\\. If so many such nights and days are put together that, reckoned by the\nmonth and by the year, they make up a period of a hundred years (of Brahman)\nit is called the age of one Brahman.\n\n16\\. A day of Purusha (Vish _n_ u) is equal in duration to the age of one\nBrahman.\n\n17\\. When it ends, a Mahakalpa is over.\n\n18\\. The night following upon it is as long.\n\n19\\. The days and nights of Purusha that have gone by are innumerable;\n\n20\\. And so are those that will follow.\n\n21\\. For Kala (time) is without either beginning or end.\n\n22\\. Thus it is, that in this Kala (time), in whom there is nothing to rest\nupon, and who is everlasting, I can espy nothing created in which there is the\nleast stability.\n\n23\\. The sands in the Ganges and (the waters pouring down from the sky) when\nIndra sends rain\n\n[21. 'Kala means Vish _n_ u in this place.' (Nand.)]\n\np. 79\n\ncan be counted, but not the number of 'Forefathers' (Brahmans) who have passed\naway.\n\n24\\. In each Kalpa, fourteen chiefs of the gods (Indras) go to destruction, as\nmany rulers of the world (kings), and fourteen Manus.\n\n25\\. And so have many thousands of Indras and hundred thousands of princes of\nthe Daityas (such as Hira _n_ yaka _s_ ipu, Hira _n_ yaksha, and others) been\ndestroyed by Kala, (time). What should one say of human beings then?\n\n26\\. 'Many royal _Ri_ shis too (such as Sagara), all of them renowned for\ntheir virtues, gods and Brahmanical _Ri_ shis (such as Ka _s_ yapas) have\nperished by the action of Kala.\n\n27\\. Those even who have the power of creating and annihilating in this world\n(the sun, moon, and other heavenly bodies) continually perish by the act of\nKala; for Kala (time) is hard to overcome.\n\n28\\. Every creature is seized upon by Kala and carried into the other world.\nIt is the slave of its actions (in a former existence). Wherefore then should\nyou wail (on its death)?\n\n29\\. Those who are born are sure to die, and those who have died are sure to\nbe born again. This is inevitable, and no associate can follow a man (in his\npassage through mundane existence).\n\n30\\. As mourners will not help the dead in this world, therefore (the\nrelatives) should not weep, but perform the obsequies to the best of their\npower.\n\n31\\. As both his good and bad actions will follow\n\n[27. Here also Kala, the god of time, is another name for Vish _n_ u. (Nand.)\n\n29\\. The same proverb occurs in the Ramaya _n_ a II, 84, 21, and in the\nBhagavadgita II, 27. See Bohtlingk, Ind. Spruche, 2383.]\n\np. 80\n\nhim (after death) like associates. what does it matter to a man whether his\nrelatives mourn over him or no?\n\n32\\. But as long as his relatives remain impure, the departed spirit finds no\nrest, and returns to visit (his relatives), whose duty it is to offer tip to\nhim the funeral ball of rice and the water libation.\n\n33\\. Till the Sapi _nd_ ikara _n_ a[1] has been performed, the dead man\nremains a disembodied spirit (and is afflicted with hunger and thirst). Give\nrice and a jar with water to the man who has passed into the abode of\ndisembodied spirits.\n\n34\\. Having passed into the abode of the manes (after the performance of the\nSapi _nd_ ikara _n_ a) he enjoys in the shape of celestial food his portion of\nthe _S_ raddha (funeral oblation); offer the _S_ raddha, therefore, to him who\nhas passed into the abode of the manes.\n\n35\\. Whether he has become a god, or stays in hell, or has entered the body of\nan animal, or of a human being, he will receive the _S_ raddha offered to him\nby his relatives.\n\n36\\. The dead person and the performer of the _S_ raddha are sure to be\nbenefitted by its performance. Perform the _S_ raddha always, therefore,\nabandoning bootless grief.\n\n37\\. This is the duty which should be constantly discharged towards a dead\nperson by his kinsmen; by mourning a man will neither benefit the dead nor\nhimself.\n\n38\\. Having seen that no help is to be had from this world, and that his\nrelations are dying (one after\n\n[33. 1 See XXI, 12.]\n\np. 81\n\nthe other), you must choose virtue for your only associate, O ye men.\n\n39\\. Even were he to die with him, a kinsman is unable to follow his dead\nrelative: all excepting his wife are forbidden to follow him on the path of\nYama.\n\n40\\. Virtue alone will follow him, wherever he, may go; therefore do your duty\nunflinchingly in this wretched world.\n\n41\\. To-morrow's business should be done to-day, and the, afternoons business\nin the forenoon; for death will not wait, whether a person has done it or not.\n\n42\\. While his mind is fixed upon his field, or traffic, or his house, or\nwhile his thoughts are engrossed by some other (beloved) object, death\nsuddenly carries him away as his, prey, as a she-wolf catches a lamb.\n\n43\\. Kala (time) is no one's friend and no one's enemy: when the effect of his\nacts in a former existence, by which his present existence is caused, has\nexpired, he snatches a man away forcibly.\n\n44\\. He will not die before his time has come, even though he has been pierced\nby a thousand shafts; he will not live after his time is out, even though he\nhas only been touched by the point of a blade of Kusa grass.\n\n45\\. Neither drugs, nor magical formulas, nor\n\n[39. This is an allusion to the custom of Sattee. (Nand.) See XXV, 14.\n\n41\\. This proverb is found in the Mahabharata also (XII, 6536. &c.) See\nBohtlingk, Ind. Spruche, 6595.\n\n43\\. This proverb is also found in the Mahabharata XI, 68, and Ramaya _n_ a\nIV, 18, 28, and other works. See Bohtlingk, 3194.\n\n45\\. 'Neither will presents of gold (to Brahma _n_ as) or other such {footnote\np 82} acts of liberality save him, as the use of the particle _k_ a implies.'\n(Nand.)]\n\np. 82\n\nburnt-offerings, nor prayers will save a man who is in the bonds of death or\nold age.\n\n46\\. An impending evil cannot be averted even by a hundred precautions; what\nreason then for you to complain?\n\n47\\. Even as a calf finds his mother among a thousand cows, an act formerly\ndone is sure to find the perpetrator.\n\n48\\. Of existing beings the beginning is unknown, the middle (of their career)\nis known, and the end again unknown; what reason then for you to complain?\n\n49\\. As the body of mortals undergoes (successively the vicissitudes of)\ninfancy, youth, and old age, even so will it be transformed into another body\n(hereafter); a sensible man is not mistaken about that.\n\n50\\. As a man puts on new clothes in this world, throwing aside those which he\nformerly wore, even so the self of man puts on new bodies, which are in\naccordance with his acts (in a former life).\n\n51\\. No weapons will hurt the self of man, no fire burn it, no waters moisten\nit, and no wind dry it up.\n\n52\\. It is not to be hurt, not to be burnt, not to be moistened, and not to be\ndried up; it is imperishable, perpetual, unchanging, immovable, without\nbeginning.\n\n[47. This proverb is also found in the Mahabharata XII, 6760, Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ atantra\nII, 134, and other works. See Bohtlingk, Ind. Spruche, 5114.\n\n48\\. This proverb is also found in the Bhagavadgita. II, 28. See Bohtlingk,\nInd. Spruche, 704.\n\n50\\. Regarding transmigration, see below, XLIV, XLV.]\n\np. 83\n\n53\\. It is (further) said to be immaterial, passing all thought, and\nimmutable. Knowing the self of man to be such, you must not grieve (for the\ndestruction of his body).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXI.](sbe07023.htm)\n\n"
