III.\n\nSaubhari and his wives adopt an ascetic life. Descendants of Mandhatri. Legend\nof Narmada and Purukutsa. Legend of Tri\xc5\x9banku. Bahu driven from his kingdom by\nthe Haihayas and Talajanghas. Birth of Sagara: he conquers the barbarians,\nimposes upon them distinguishing usages, and excludes them from offerings to\nfire, and the study of the Vedas.\n\nHAVING thus communed with himself, Saubhari abandoned his children, his home,\nand all his splendour, and, accompanied by his wives, entered the forest,\nwhere he daily practised the observances followed by the ascetics termed\nVaikhanasas (or anchorets having families), until he had cleansed himself from\nall sin. When his intellect had attained maturity, he concentrated in his\nspirit the sacramental fires 1, and became a religious mendicant. Then having\nconsigned all his acts to the supreme, he obtained the condition of Achyuta,\nwhich knows no change, and is not subject to the vicissitudes of birth,\ntransmigration, or death. Whoever reads, or hears, or remembers, or\nunderstands, this legend of Saubhari, and his espousal of the daughters of\nMandhatri, shall never, for eight successive births, be addicted to evil\nthoughts, nor shall he act unrighteously, nor shall his mind dwell upon\nimproper objects, nor shall he be influenced by selfish attachments. The line\nof Mandhatri is now resumed.\n\nThe son of Ambarisha, the son of Mandhatri, was Yuvana\xc5\x9bwa; his son was Harita\n2, from whom the Angirasa Haritas were descended 3.\n\np. 370\n\nIn the regions below the earth the Gandharbas called Mauneyas (or sons of the\nMuni Ka\xc5\x9byapa), who were sixty millions in number, had defeated the tribes of\nthe Nagas, or snake-gods, and seized upon their most precious jewels, and\nusurped their dominion. Deprived of their power by the Gandharbas, the serpent\nchiefs addressed the god of the gods, as he awoke from his slumbers; and the\nblossoms of his lotus eyes opened while listening to their hymns. They said,\n"Lord, how shall we be delivered from this great fear?" Then replied the first\nof males, who is without beginning, "I will enter into the person of\nPurukutsa, the son of Mandhatri, the son of Yuvana\xc5\x9bwa, and in him will I quiet\nthese iniquitous Gandharbas." On hearing these words, the snake-gods bowed and\nwithdrew, and returning to their country dispatched Narmada to solicit the aid\nof Purukutsa 4.\n\nNarmada accordingly went to Purukutsa, and conducted him to the regions below\nthe earth, where, being filled with the might of the deity, he destroyed the\nGandharbas. He then returned to his own palace; and the snake-gods, in\nacknowledgment of Narmada\'s services, conferred upon her as a blessing, that\nwhosoever should think of her, and invoke her name, should never have any\ndread of the venom of snakes. This is the invocation; "Salutation be to\nNarmada in the morning; salutation be to Narmada at night; salutation be to\nthee, O Narmada! defend me\n\np. 371\n\nfrom the serpent\'s poison." Whoever repeats this day and night, shall never be\nbitten by a snake in the dark nor in entering a chamber; nor shall he who\ncalls it to mind when he eats suffer any injury from poison, though it be\nmixed with his food. To Purukutsa also the snake-gods announced that the\nseries of his descendants should never be cut off.\n\nPurukutsa had a son by Narmada named Trasadasyu, whose son was Sambhuta 5,\nwhose son was Anaran\xcc\x81ya, who was slain, by Ravan\xcc\x81a in his triumphant progress\nthrough the nations. The son of Anaran\xcc\x81ya was Prishada\xc5\x9bwa; his son was\nHaryya\xc5\x9bwa; his son was Sumanas 6; his son was Tridhanwan; his son was\nTrayyarun\xcc\x81a; and his son was Satyavrata, who obtained the appellation of\nTri\xc5\x9banku, and was degraded to the condition of a Chan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ala, or outcast 7.\nDuring a twelve years\' famine Tri\xc5\x9banku provided the flesh of deer for the\nnourishment of the wife and children of Viswamitra, suspending it upon a\nspreading fig-tree on the borders of the Ganges, that he might not subject\nthem to the indignity of receiving presents from an outcast. On this account\nVi\xc5\x9bwamitra, being highly pleased with him, elevated him in his living body to\nheaven 8.\n\np. 372\n\nThe son of Tri\xc5\x9banku was Hari\xc5\x9bchandra 9; his son was\n\np. 373\n\n[paragraph continues] Rohita\xc5\x9bwa 10; his son was Harita 11; his son was Chunchu\n12, who had two sons named Vijaya and Sudeva. Ruruka 13 was the son of Vijaya,\nand his own son was Vrika, whose son was Bahu (or Bathuka). This prince was\nvanquished by the tribes of Haihayas and Talajanghas 14, anti his country was\noverrun by them; in consequence of which he fled into the forests with his\nwives. One of these was pregnant, and being an object of jealousy to a rival\nqueen, the latter gave her poison to prevent her delivery. The poison had the\neffect of confining the child in the womb for seven years. Bahu, having waxed\nold, died in the neighbourhood of the residence of the Muni Aurva. His queen\nhaving constructed his pile, ascended it with the determination of\naccompanying him in death; but the sage Aurva, who knew all things, past,\npresent, and to come, issued forth from his hermitage, and forbade her,\nsaying, "Hold! hold! this is unrighteous; a valiant prince, the monarch of\nmany realms, the\n\np. 374\n\nofferer of many sacrifices, the destroyer of his foes, a universal emperor, is\nin thy womb; think not of committing so desperate an act!" Accordingly, in\nobedience to his injunctions, she relinquished her intention. The sage then\nconducted, her to his abode, and after some time a very splendid boy was there\nborn. Along with him the poison that had been given to his mother was\nexpelled; and Aurva, after performing the ceremonies required at birth, gave\nhim on that account the name of Sagara (from Sa, \'with,\' and Gara, \'poison\').\nThe same holy sage celebrated his investure with the cord of his class,\ninstructed him fully in the Vedas, and taught him the use of arms, especially\nthose of fire, called after Bhargava.\n\nWhen the boy had grown up, and was capable of reflection, he said to his\nmother one day, "Why are we dwelling in this hermitage? where is my father?\nand who is he?" His mother, in reply, related to him all that had happened.\nUpon hearing which he was highly incensed, and vowed to recover his\npatrimonial kingdom; and exterminate the Haihayas and Talajanghas, by whom it\nhad been overrun. Accordingly when he became a man he put nearly the whole of\nthe Haihayas to death, and would have also destroyed the \xc5\x9aakas, the Yavanas,\nKambojas, Paradas, and Pahnavas 15, but that they applied to Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, the\n\np. 375\n\nfamily priest of Sagara, for protection. Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha regarding them as\nannihilated (or deprived of power), though living, thus spake to Sagara:\n"Enough, enough, my son, pursue no farther these objects of your wrath, whom\nyou may look upon as no more. In order to fulfil your vow I have separated\nthem from affinity to the regenerate tribes, and from the duties of their\ncastes." Sagara, in compliance with the injunctions of his spiritual guide,\ncontented himself therefore with imposing upon the vanquished nations peculiar\ndistinguishing marks. He made the Yavanas 16 shave their heads entirely; the\n\xc5\x9aakas he compelled to shave (the upper) half of their heads; the Paradas wore\ntheir hair long; and the Pahnavas let their beards grow, in obedience to his\ncommands 17. Them also, and other Kshatriya races, he deprived of the\nestablished usages of oblations to fire and the study of the Vedas; and thus\nseparated from religious rites, and abandoned by the Brahmans, these different\ntribes became Mlechchhas. Sagara, after the recovery of his kingdom, reigned\nover the seven-zoned earth with undisputed dominion 18.\n\np. 376\n\nThis page consists solely of footnotes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[369:1](vp095.htm#fr_971) So Manu; "Having reposited, as the law directs, the\nholy fires in his breast," &c. VI. 25.\n\n[369:2](vp095.htm#fr_972) The Vayu, Linga, Kurma, and Bhagavata agree in this\nseries; the others omit it.\n\n[369:3](vp095.htm#fr_973) The words of the text are ###, and the commentator\nexplains the phrase, \'the Angirasa Brahmans, of whom the Harita family was the\nchief.\' The Linga reads, \'Harita was the son of Yuvana\xc5\x9bwa, whose sons were the\nHaritas; they were on the part (or followers) of Angiras, and were Brahmans\nwith the properties of Kshatriyas.\' The Vayu has, \'Harita was the son of\nYuvana\xc5\x9bwa, from whom were many called p. 370 Haritas; they were sons of\nAngiras, and Brahmans with the properties of Kshatriyas.\' The Bhagavata has\nonly, These (Ambarisha, Purukutsa, and Harita) were, according to \xc5\x9aridhara\nSwami\'s comment, the chiefs of Mandhatri\'s descendants, being founders of\nthree several branches: or it may mean, he says, merely that they had\nMandhatri for their progenitor, Mandhatri being by some also named Angiras,\naccording to A\xc5\x9bwalayana. It may be questioned if the compilers of the\nPuran\xcc\x81as, or their annotators, knew exactly what to make of this and similar\nphrases, although they were probably intended to intimate that some persons of\nKshatriya origin became the. disciples of certain Brahmans, particularly of\nAngiras, and afterwards founders of schools of religious instruction\nthemselves. Mandhatri himself is the author of a hymn in the Rig-veda. As.\nRes. VIII. 385. Harita is the name of an individual sage, considered as the\nson of Chyavana, and to whom a work on law is attributed. It is probably\nrather that of a school, however, than of an individual.\n\n[370:4](vp095.htm#fr_974) Narmada, the personified Nerbudda river, was,\naccording to the Bhagavata, the sister of the Nagas.\n\n[371:5](vp095.htm#fr_975) We have some varieties here. Instead of Trasadasyu\nthe Matsya has Dussaha, whom it makes the husband of Narmada, and father of\nSambhuti, the father of Tridhanwan. The Bhagavata omits Sambhuti; the Linga\nmakes him the brother of Trasadasyu; and the Agni has in his place Sudhanwan.\n\n[371:6](vp095.htm#fr_976) Vrishada\xc5\x9bwa: Vayu. The Matsya, Agni, and Brahma omit\nall between Sambhuta and Tridhanwan. The Bhagavata has a rather different\nseries, or Anaran\xcc\x81ya, Haryya\xc5\x9bwa, Arun\xcc\x81a, Tribandhana, Tri\xc5\x9banku. As Anaran\xcc\x81ya\nis famous in Hindu story, and Trayyarun\xcc\x81a is a contributor to the Rig-veda,\ntheir omission shews careless compilation.\n\n[371:7](vp095.htm#fr_977) The Vayu states he was banished by his father for\nhis wickedness (Adharma). The Brahma P. and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba detail his iniquity at\nlength; and it is told more concisely in the Linga. He carried off the\nbetrothed wife of another man, one of the citizens according to the two\nformer, of Vidarbha according to the latter: for this, his father, by the\nadvice of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, banished him, and he took refuge with \xc5\x9awapakas. The\nRamayan\xcc\x81a has a different story, and ascribes Tri\xc5\x9banku\'s degradation to the\ncurse of the sons of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, to whom the king had applied to conduct his\nsacrifice, after their father had refused to do so. Before that, he is\ndescribed as a pious prince, and the object of his sacrifice was to ascend to\nheaven.\n\n[371:8](vp095.htm#fr_978) The occurrence of the famine, and Satyavrata\'s care\nof the wife and family of Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra, are told, with some variations, in the\nVayu, which has been followed by p. 372 the Brahma and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba. During the\nfamine, when game finis he kills the cow of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha; and for the three\ncrimes of displeasing his father, killing a cow, and eating flesh not\npreviously consecrated, he acquires the name of Tri\xc5\x9banku (tri, \'three,\' \xc5\x9banku,\n\'sin\'). Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha refusing to perform his regal inauguration, Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra\ncelebrates the rites, and on his death elevates the king in his mortal body to\nheaven. The Ramayan\xcc\x81a relates the same circumstance, but assigns to it a\ndifferent motive, Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra\'s resentment of the refusal of the gods to attend\nTri\xc5\x9banku\'s sacrifice. That work also describes the attempt of the gods to cast\nthe king down upon earth, and the compromise between them and Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra, by\nwhich Tri\xc5\x9banku was left suspended, head downwards, in mid-air, forming a\nconstellation in the southern hemisphere, along with other new planets and\nstars formed by Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra. The Bhagavata has an allusion to this legend,\nsaying that Tri\xc5\x9banku is still visible in heaven. The Vayu furnishes some\nfurther information from an older source. Both my copies leave a blank where\nit is marked, and a similar passage does not elsewhere occur; but the word\nshould probably be ###, and the whole may be thus rendered: \'Men acquainted\nwith the Puran\xcc\x81as recite these two stanzas; "By the favour of Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra the\nillustrious Tri\xc5\x9banku shines in heaven along with the gods, through the\nkindness of that sage. Slowly passes the lovely night in winter, embellished\nby the moon, decorated with three watches, and ornamented with the\nconstellation Tri\xc5\x9banku:"\' This legend is therefore clearly astronomical, and\nalludes possibly to some reformation of the sphere by Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra, under the\npatronage of Tri\xc5\x9banku, and in opposition to a more ancient system advocated by\nthe school of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha. It might be no very rash conjecture, perhaps, to\nidentify Tri\xc5\x9banku with Orion, the three bright stars of whose belt may have\nsuggested the three \xc5\x9aankus (stakes or pins) which form his name.\n\n[372:9](vp095.htm#fr_979) The Pauran\xcc\x81ik lists generally dismiss Hari\xc5\x9bchandra\nvery summarily, but he makes a conspicuous figure in legends of an apparently\nlater date. In the Mahabharata, Sabha Parva, it is stated that he resides in\nthe court of Indra, to which he was elevated for his performance of the\nRajasuya sacrifice, and for his unbounded liberality. This seems to have\nserved as the groundwork of the tale told in the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya and Padma\nPuran\xcc\x81as, of his having given his whole country, his wife and son, and finally\nhimself, to Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra, in satisfaction of his demands for Dakshin\xcc\x81a. In\nconsequence he was elevated with his subjects to heaven, from whence, having\nbeen insidiously led by Nareda to boast of his merits, he was again\nprecipitated. His repentance of his pride, however, arrested his downward\ndescent, and he and his train paused in mid-air. The city of Hari\xc5\x9bchandra is\npopularly believed to be at times still p. 373 visible in the skies. The\nindignation of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha at Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra\'s insatiableness produced a quarrel,\nin which their mutual imprecations changed them to two birds, the \xc5\x9aarali, a\nsort of Turdus, and the Baka, or crane. In these forms they fought for a\nconsiderable term, until Brahma interposed, and reconciled them. The Bhagavata\nalludes to this story, in its notice of Hari\xc5\x9bchandra; but the Vayu refers the\nconflict to the reign of a different prince: see c. 2. n. 11. According to the\n\xc5\x9aiva P., Hari\xc5\x9bchandra was an especial worshipper of that deity; and his wife\nSatyavati was a form of Jaya, one of Durga\'s handmaids.\n\n[373:10](vp095.htm#fr_980) Also read Rohita. Traces of his name appear in the\nstrong holds of Rotas, in Behar and in the Panjab. The Bhagavata has a legend\nof his having been devoted to Varun\xcc\x81a, before his birth, by his father, who\nhaving on various pleas deferred offering his son as promised, was afflicted\nby a dropsy. Rohita at last purchased \xc5\x9aunah\xc5\x9bephas, who was offered as a victim\nin his stead: see hereafter, note on \xc5\x9aunah\xc5\x9bephas.\n\n[373:11](vp095.htm#fr_981) Omitted: Agni, Linga, and Matsya.\n\n[373:12](vp095.htm#fr_982) Omitted: Agni. Dhundhu: Linga and Kurma. Champa,\nfounder of Champamalini: Bhagavata. But all other authorities make Champa a\ndifferent person, a descendant of Anga: see family of Ann, of the lunar race.\n\n[373:13](vp095.htm#fr_983) Kuruka: Linga and Kurma. Bharuka: Bhagavata.\n\n[373:14](vp095.htm#fr_984) Descendants of Yadu. The first springs from a\nprince who is the twelfth, and t\xcc\x81he second from one who is the eighteenth, in\nthe lunar line, and both are thus cotemporary with a prince who is the thirty-\nfifth of the solar dynasty. The Vayu adds, that they were assisted by \xc5\x9aakas,\nYavanas, Kambojas, Paravas, and Pahlavas.\n\n[374:15](vp095.htm#fr_985) The Haihayas we shall have farther occasion to\nnotice. The \xc5\x9aakas are, no doubt, the Sacae or Sakai of the classical\ngeographers, Scythians and Indo-Scythians, Turk or Tartar tribes, who\nestablished themselves, about a century and a half before our era, along the\nwestern districts of India, and who are not improbably connected with our\nSaxon forefathers. The Yavanas are the Ionians or Greeks. The Kambojas were a\npeople on the northwest of India, of whom it is said that they were remarkable\nfor a capital breed of horses. There is an apparent trace of their name in the\nCaumogees of Kaferistan, who may have retreated to the mountains before the\nadvance of the Turk tribes. (Elphinstone\'s Caubul, 619: see also before, [p.\n194](vp061.htm#page_194). n. [146](vp061.htm#fn_622).) The Paradas and\nPahlavas or Pahnavas may designate other bordering tribes in the same\ndirection, or on the confines of Persia. Along with these, in the legend that\nfollows, the Bhagavata enumerates Barbaras. The Vayu adds Mahishikas, Chaulas,\nDarvas, and Khasas: the two former of which are people on the Malabar and\nCoromandel coasts; the two latter are usually placed amongst the mountaineers\nof the Hindu Kosh. The Brahma P. lengthens the list with the Kolas, the forest\nraces of eastern Gondwana; the Sarpas and thep. 375 Keralas, who are the\npeople of Malabar. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba still farther extends the enumeration with\nthe Tusharas or Tokharas, the Turks of Tokharestan; the Chinas, Chinese; the\nMadras, people in the Panjab; the Kishkindhas, in Mysore; Kauntalas, along the\nNarbudda; Bangas, Bengalis; \xc5\x9aalwas, people in western India; and the Konkanas,\nor inhabitants of the Concan. It is evident from the locality of most of the\nadditions of the last authority, that its compiler or corrupter has been a\nnative of the Dekhin.\n\n[375:16](vp095.htm#fr_986) And Kambojas: Vayu.\n\n[375:17](vp095.htm#fr_987) The Asiatic nations generally shave the head either\nwholly or in part. Amongst the Greeks it was common to shave the fore part of\nthe head, a custom introduced, according to Plutarch, by the Abantes, whom\nHomer calls \xe1\xbd\x84\xcf\x80\xce\xb9\xce\xb8\xce\xb5\xce\xbd \xce\xba\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xb6\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xcf\x82 and followed, according to Xenophon, by the\nLacedaemonians. It may be doubted, however, if the Greeks or Ionians ever\nshaved the head completely. The practice prevails amongst the Mohammedans, but\nit is not universal. The \xc5\x9aakas, Scythians or Tartars, shave the fore part of\nthe head, gathering the hair at the back into a long tail, as do the Chinese.\nThe mountaineers of the Himalaya shave the crown of the head, as do the people\nof Kaferistan, with exception of a single tuft. What Oriental people wore\ntheir hair long, except at the back of the head, is questionable; and the\nusage would be characteristic rather of the Teutonic and Gothic nations. The\nancient Persians had long bushy beards, as the Persepolitan sculptures\ndemonstrate. In Chardin\'s time they were out of fashion, but they were again\nin vogue in that country in the reign of the last king, Fateh Shuh.\n\n[375:18](vp095.htm#fr_988) So the Vayu, &c.; and a similar p. 376 statement is\ngiven in Manu, X. 44, where to the \xc5\x9aakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Paradas, and\nPahnavas, are added the Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81aras (people of western Bengal), Od\xcc\x81ras (those\nof Orissa), Draviras (of the Coromandel coast), Chinas (Chinese), Kiratas\n(mountaineers), and Daradas (Durds of the Hindu Koh). From this passage, and a\nsimilar one in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, in which the Chinas are mentioned, the late Mr.\nKlaproth inferred those works to be not older than the third century B. C.,\nwhen the reigning dynasty of Thsin first gave that name to China (see also [p.\n194](vp061.htm#page_194). n. [145](vp061.htm#fn_621).) It was probable, he\nsupposed, that the Hindus became acquainted with the Chinese only about 200 B.\nC., when their arms extended to the Oxus; but it is difficult to reconcile\nthis date with the difference of style between the Ramayan\xcc\x81a particularly and\nthe works of the era of Vikramaditya. It would seem more likely that the later\nappellations were interpolated. It must have been a period of some antiquity,\nwhen all the nations from Bengal to the Coromandel coast were considered as\nMlechchhas and outcasts.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV](vp096.htm)\n\n'
