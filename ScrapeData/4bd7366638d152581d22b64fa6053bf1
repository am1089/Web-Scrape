Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! After having chanted the above hymn to\nthe Goddess Savitri and worshipped Her in accordance with due rites and\nceremonies, the king As\xc2\x92vapati saw the Devi, effulgent like the lustre of\nthousand suns. She then smilingly told the king, as a mother to her son,\nwhilst all the quarters were illumined with the lustre of Her body :--\n\n\n\n3-14. Savitri said :-- \xc2\x93O King! I know your desire. Certainly I will give what\nyou and your wife long for. Your chaste wife is anxious for a daughter, while\nyou want a son. So, one after another,\n\n\n\np. 911\n\n\n\nthe desires of both of you will be fulfilled.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the Devi went to\nthe Brahma Loka. The King also returned to his house. First a daughter was\nborn to him. As the daughter was born, as if a second Lak _s_ mi was born\nafter worshipping Savitri, the King kept her name as Savitri. As time rolled\non, the daughter grew, day by day, like the phases of bright fortnight moon,\ninto youth and beauty. There was a son of Dyumat Sena, named Satyavana, always\ntruthful, good natured and endowed with various other qualifications. The\ndaughter chose him for her bridegroom. The King betrothed her with jewels and\nornaments, to Satyavana, who gladly took her home. After one year expired, the\ntruthful vigorous Satyavana gladly went out, by his father\xc2\x92s command, to\ncollect fruits and fuel. The chaste Savitri, too, followed him. Unfortunately\nSatyavana fell down from a tree and died. Yama, the God of Death, saw his soul\nas a Puru _s_ a of the size of one\xc2\x92s thumb and took it and went away. The\nchaste Savitri began to follow Him. The high souled Yama, the Foremost of the\nSadhus, seeing Savitri following Him, addressed her sweetly :-- O Savitri!\nWhither are you going in your this mortal coil? If you like to follow after\nall, then quit your this body.\n\n\n\n15-25. The mortal man, with his transient coil of these five elements, is not\nable to go to My Abode. O Chaste One! The death time of your husband arrived;\ntherefore Satyavana is going to My Abode to reap the fruits of his Karma.\nEvery living animal is born by his Karma. He dies again through his life long\nKarma. It is his Karma alone that ordains pleasure, pain, fear, sorrows, etc.\nBy Karma, this embodied soul here becomes Indra; by Karma he can become a\nBrahma\xc2\x92s son. What more than this that Jiva, by his Karma, can be in Hari\xc2\x92s\nservice and be free from birth and death! By one\xc2\x92s own Karma all sorts of\nSiddhis and immortality can be obtained; the four blessed regions as Vi _sn_\nu\xc2\x92s Salokya, etc., also can be obtained by Karma. What more than this that by\nKarma, a being becomes divine, human, or a King, or S\xc2\x92iva or Ganes\xc2\x92a! The\nstate of Munindra, asceticism, K _s_ attriyahood, Vais\xc2\x92yahood, Mlechhahood,\nmoving things, stones, Rak _s_ asahood, Kinnaras, Kingship, becoming trees,\nbeasts, forest animals, inferior animals, worms, Daityas, Danavas, Asuras, all\nare fashioned and wrought by Karma and Karma alone. O Narada! Thus speaking,\nYama remained silent.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-seventh Chapter of the Ninth Book on the birth, etc., of\nSavitri in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 28](bk09ch28.htm)\n\n'
