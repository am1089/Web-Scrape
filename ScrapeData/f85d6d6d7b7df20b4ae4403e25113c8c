Mahi _s_ a said :-- O Devi! Mandodari had a sister Indumati; unmarried\nand endowed with all auspicious signs. She grew up in time to a marriageable\nage. The Svayambara assembly (a marriage in which the girl chooses her husband\nfrom among a number of visitors assembled together) was then called for the\nmarriage of the maiden Indumati. The Kings from various parts came there and\nthe maiden Indumati selected from among them a beautiful strong king, of noble\nlineage and endowed with all auspicious signs. At that time, by the\nundescribeable power of Destiny, Mandodari seeing the deceitful, cunning, and\nhypocrite King of Madra, became passionate and desired to marry him.\n\n\n\n5-17. That slender woman Mandodari then addressed her father thus :-- \xc2\x93O\nFather! Seeing the King of Madra in this assembly, I am desirous to marry him;\nso perform also my marriage ceremony now.\xc2\x94 When the king heard this request\nfrom her own daughter privately, he became very glad and began with\npromptness, to make preparations for the marriage. He invited the King of\nMadra to his own palace and gave him in marriage his own daughter Mandodari,\naccording to due rites and ceremonies with an abundance of dowry and wealth.\nThe King of Madra Charude _sn_ a became very glad to marry the beautiful\nMandodari and went back with her to his own abode. The King Charude _sn_ a\nthen enjoyed her for good many days; when one day a maid-servant found the\nking in sexual intercourse with another maid-servant in a lonely place and\ndivulged this to Mandodari; she finding the king in that state became angry\nand rebuked him with a slight smiling countenance. Again, on another occasion,\nMandodari saw the king willingly engaged in amusements and sports with an\nordinary beautiful woman and became very sorry and thought thus :-- When I saw\nhim in the Svayamvara, I could not recognise him as a cheat; I am deceived by\nthis King; Oh! What a wrong act have I done through delusion. This King is a\nrogue and he is totally shameless and has no dislike for contemptible things;\nit is now too late to repent for him. How can I have any affection for this\nhusband; fie on my living now! I forsake from this very day all the pleasures\nwith my husband and all other worldly pleasures, and I take recourse now to\ncontentment alone. I have committed a very wrong act that I ought never to\nhave done; therefore it causes intense pain to me now. If I now commit\nsuicide, then that sin will never forsake me, and I must have to enjoy the\nconsequences thereof. And if I return to\n\n\n\np. 415\n\n\n\nmy father\xc2\x92s house, I will not be happy there, for my companions seeing me thus\nwill, no doubt, ridicule me. Therefore, it is now advisable for me to avoid\nall the sensuous pleasures, become dispassionate and remain here patiently and\nabide by the strange combinations of Time.\n\n\n\n18-20. Mahi _s_ a said :-- Thus that women lamented and remorsed and began to\nremain there, very much sorrowful and distressed, renouncing thoroughly all\nthe pleasures of the world. O Auspicious One! I am the king, yet you are\nshowing your dislike for me; know, eventually, you, too, will be passionate\nand entertain afterwards an illiterate coward. Keep my word even now, it will\nbe of great benefit and it will serve as a medicinal diet to you as to all\nwomen. In case you do not follow my advice, you will have to meet with extreme\npain and misery, certainly.\n\n\n\n21-25. Hearing the words of Mahi _s_ asura, the Devi said :-- O you fool! Go\nto the lower worlds or stand up for fight; I will send you and the other\nDanavas unto death and then go away at my pleasure. O Demon! I take up form to\npreserve the righteous, whenever they suffer pain in this earth. O Lord of the\nDaityas! Formless, birthless I am; yet, at times, I take up form and be born\nto save the Devas. Know this firmly. O wicked Mahi _s_ a! The Devas prayed to\nMe for your destruction. Therefore I will not rest until I kill you. I speak\nall these truly to you. Therefore fight or go to Patala, the abode of the\nAsuras; I speak truly to you again that I will destroy you wholly.\n\n\n\n26-51. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the Devi\xc2\x92s words, the Danava took\nup his bow and came to the battle, fully stretching the string of his bow up\nto his ears, and began to shoot sharpened arrows with great force at the Devi.\nThe Devi, too, hurled with anger, arrows tipped with iron and cut off the\nAsura\xc2\x92s arrows to pieces. The fight between them rose to such a terrible pitch\nthat it caused terror to both the Devas and the Danavas, trying hard to be\nvictorious over each other. In the midst of the terrible encounter, the demon\nDurdhara came up to fight and made the Devi angry and shot arrows, all\nterribly poisonous and sharpened on stones, at Her. The Bhagavati, then, got\nvery angry and hit him hard with sharp arrows. Durdhara, struck thus, fell\ndown dead on the battlefield like a mountain top. The demon Trinetra, well\nskilled in the uses of arrows and weapons, seeing him killed, came up to fight\nand shot at the Great Goddess with seven arrows. Before these arrows came on\nHer, She cut them to pieces with Her sharp arrows and by Her trident killed\nTrinetra. Trinetra thus killed, Andhaka quickly came in the battlefield and\nstruck violently on the head of the lion with his iron club. The lion killed\nthat powerful Andhaka by striking the demon\n\n\n\np. 416\n\n\n\nwith his nails and, out of anger, began to eat his flesh. Mahi _s_ asura\nbecame greatly astonished at the death of these Asuras and began to shoot\npointed arrows, sharpened on stone, at Her. The Devi Ambika cut his arrows\ninto two before they came on Her and struck the Demon on his breast by Her\nclub. That vile Mahi _s_ asura, the tormentor of the Devas, fell in a swoon\nunder the stoke of the club but patiently bore it and, at the next moment,\ncame again and struck the lion on his head by his club. The lion, too, by his\nnails rent that great Asura to pieces. Mahi _s_ asura, then, quitting the man-\nform took up the lion-form and by his claws cut the Devi\xc2\x92s lion and wounded\nhim very much by his nails. On Mahi _s_ asura taking up this lion-form, the\nDevi became very angry and began to shoot arrows after arrows at him all very\nterrible, sharp and like poisonous snakes. Then the Asura quitting the lion\nform assumed the appearance of a male elephant, oozing out juice from his\ntemples and began to hurl the mountain tops by his trunk. Seeing the mountain\npeaks thus hurled on Her, She cut them off to pieces by Her sharp arrows and\nbegan to laugh. The Devi\xc2\x92s lion on the other hand, sprang on the head of the\nelephant Mahi _s_ a and by his claws rent him to pieces. To kill the Devi\xc2\x92s\nlion, then, Mahi _s_ a quitted his elephant-form and assumed the appearance of\na Sarabha, more powerful and terrible than lion. The Devi seeing that Sarabha\nbecame angry and struck on the head of that Sarabha with Her axe; the Sarabha,\ntoo, attacked the Devi. Their fight became horrible; Mahi _s_ asura, then,\nassumed the appearance of a buffalo and struck the Bhagavati by his horns.\nThat horrible Asura, of hideous appearance, swinging his tail, began to attack\nthe thin bodied Devi. That violent Asura caught hold of the mountain peaks by\nhis tail and, whirling them round and round, hurled them on the Devi. That\nvicious soul, then, maddened with his strength, laughed incessantly and\naddressed thus :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! Be steady in the battlefield. I will send you\ntoday unto death, and your youth and beauty too. You are an illiterate fellow\nas you have come maddened to fight with me. Really you are deluded in your\npretensions that you are very strong; this idea of yours is absolutely false.\nI will kill you first and the hypocrite Devas after who want to vanquish me by\nstanding up a woman in their front.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n52-53. The Devi said :-- \xc2\x93O Villain! Do not boast; keep yourself firm in the\nfight. Today I will kill you and make the Devas discard their fear. O Wretch!\nYou are a Sinner; you torment the Devas and terrify the Munis. Let me have my\ndrink of sweet decoction of grapes. And then I will slay you undoubtedly.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 417\n\n\n\n54-70. Vyasa said :-- O King! Saying thus, the Devi, wrathful and eager to\nkill Mahi _s_ asura, took up the golden cup filled with wine and drank again\nand again. When the Devi finished Her drink of the sweet grape juice, She\npursued him with trident in Her hands, to the great joy of gladdening all the\nDevas. The Devas began to rain showers of flowers on the Devi and praised Her\nand shouted victories to Her with Dundubhi (a Divine drum) Jai, Jiva; victory,\nlive. The Ri _s_ is, Siddhas, Gandarbhas, Pis\xc2\x92achas, Uragas, and Kinnaras\nwitnessed the battle from the celestial space and became very much delighted.\nOn the other hand, Mahi _s_ asura, the hypocrite Pundit, began to assume\nvarious magic forms and struck the Devi repeatedly. The Devi Cha _nd_ ika,\nthen, infuriated and with eyes reddened, pierced violently the breast of that\nvicious Mahi _s_ a with Her sharp trident. The Demon, then, struck by this\ntrident, fell senseless on the ground; but got up in the next moment and\nkicked the Devi forcibly. That Great Asura, thus kicking the Devi, laughed\nrepeatedly and bellowed so loudly that the Devas were all terrified with that\nnoise. Then the Devi held aloft the brilliant discus of good axle and of\nthousand spokes and loudly spoke to the Asura in front :-- O Stupid! Look!\nThis Chakra will sever your throat today; wait a moment, I am sending you\ninstantly unto death. Saying this, the Divine Mother hurled the Chakra.\nInstantly that weapon severed the Danava\xc2\x92s head from his body. The hot streams\nof blood gushed out from his neck as the violent streams of water get out from\nmountains, coloured red with red sandstones. The headless body of that Asura\nmoved, to and fro, for a moment and then dropped on the ground. The loud\nacclamations of \xc2\x93Victory\xc2\x94 were sounded to the great joy of the Devas. The very\npowerful lion began to devour the soldiers that were flying away, as if he was\nvery hungry. O King! The wicked Mahi _s_ asura thus slain, the Demons that\nremained alive were terrified and fled away, very much frightened, to Patala.\nThe Devas, Ri _s_ is, human beings and the other saints on this earth were all\nextremely glad at the death of this wicked Demon. The Bhagavati Cha _nd_ ika\nquitted the battlefield and waited in a holy place. Then the Devas came there\nwith a desire to praise and chant hymns to the Devi, the Bestower of their\nhappiness.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighteenth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the killing of the\nDanava Mahi _s_ asura in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 19](bk05ch19.htm)\n\n'
