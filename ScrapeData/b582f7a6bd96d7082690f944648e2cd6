But the (meditations) connected with members (of sacrificial acts are)\nnot (restricted) to (particular) _S_ akhas, according to the Veda (to which\nthey belong).\n\nThe above occasional discussion being terminated, we return to the discussion\nof the matter in hand.--We meet in the different _S_ akhas of each Veda with\ninjunctions of vidyas connected with certain members of sacrificial acts, such\nas the udgitha and the like. Cp. e.g. \'Let a man meditate on the syllable Om\n(as) the udgitha\' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 1, 1); \'Let a man meditate on the fivefold\nSaman as the five worlds\' ( _Kh_. Up. II, 2, I); \'People say: "Hymns, hymns!"\nthe hymn is truly this earth\' (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 1, 2, 1); \'The piled up fire-altar\ntruly is this world\' ( _S_ at. Bra. X, 5, 4, 1). A doubt here arises whether\nthe vidyas are enjoined with reference to the udgitha and so on as belonging\nto a certain _S_ akha only or as belonging to all _S_ akhas. The doubt is\nraised on the supposition that the udgitha and so on differ in the different\n_S_ akhas because the accents, &c. differ.\n\nHere the purvapakshin maintains that the vidyas are enjoined only with\nreference to the udgitha and so on which belong to the particular _S_ akha (to\nwhich the vidya belongs).--Why?--On account of proximity. For as such general\ninjunctions as \'Let a man meditate on the udgitha\' are in need of a\nspecification, and as this need is satisfied by the specifications given in\nthe same _S_ akha which stand in immediate proximity, there is no reason for\npassing over that _S_ akha and having recourse to specifications enjoined\n\np. 273\n\nin other _S_ akhas. Hence the vidyas are to be held apart, according to the\n_S_ akhas to which they belong.\n\nTo this the Sutra replies \'but those connected with members,\' &c.--The word\n\'but\' discards the prima facie view. The meditations are not restricted to\ntheir own _S_ akhas according to the Veda to which they belong, but are valid\nfor all _S_ akhas.--Why?--Because the direct statements of the texts about the\nudgitha and so on enounce no specification. For to such general injunctions as\n\'Let a man meditate on the udgitha\'--which say nothing about specifications--\nviolence would be done, if on the ground of proximity we restricted them to\nsomething special belonging to its own _S_ akha, and that would be\nobjectionable because direct statement has greater weight than proximity.\nThere is, on the other hand, no reason why the vidya should not be of general\nreference. We therefore conclude that, although the _S_ akhas differ as to\naccents and the like, the vidyas mentioned refer to the udgitha and so on\nbelonging to all _S_ akhas, because the text speaks only of the udgitha and so\non in general.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 56](sbe38199.htm)\n\n'
