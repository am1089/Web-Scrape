Naraya _n_ a said : -- S\xc2\x92iva, versed in the knowledge of the Higher\nReality, hearing all this, went himself with His whole host to the battle.\nSeeing Him, S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a alighted from his chariot and fell prostrate\nbefore him. With great force he got up and, quickly putting on his armour he\ntook up his huge and heavy bow case. Then a great fight ensued between\n\n\n\np. 896\n\n\n\nS\xc2\x92iva and S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a for full one hundred years but there was no defeat\nnor victory on either side. The result was stalemate. Both of them, Bhagavan\nand the Danava quitted their weapons. S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, remained on his\nchariot and Mahadeva role on His Bull. Hundreds and hundreds of Danavas were\nslain. But extraordinarily endowed with divine power, S\xc2\x92ambhu restored to life\nall those of His party that were slain.\n\n\n\n7-30. In the meanwhile, an aged Brahma _n_ a, very distressed in his\nappearance, came to the battlefield and asked S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, the King of\nDanavas :-- \xc2\x93O King! Grant me what I beg of you; you give away in charity all\nsorts of wealth and riches; give me also what I desire; give me, a Brahmi _n_\n, something also. I am a quiet peaceable aged Brahmi _n_ , very very thirsty.\nMake your Promise first and then I will speak to you what I desire.\xc2\x94 (Note :--\nThe Brahmi _n_ s only are fit for receiving frauds and cheatings.)\n\n\n\nThe King S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, with a gracious countenance and pleasing eyes swore\nbefore him that He would give him what he would desire. Then the Brahmi _n_\nspoke to the King with great affection and Maya :-- \xc2\x93I am desirous of your\nKavacha (amulet).\xc2\x94 The King, then, gave him the Kavacha (the amulet, mantra\nwritten on a Bhurja bark and located in a golden cup). Bhagavan Hari (in the\nform of that Brahmi _n_ ) took that Kavacha and, assuming the form of\nS\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a came to Tulasi. Coming there, He made His Maya (magic)\nmanifest and held sexual intercourse with her. At this time Mahadeva took up\nthe Hari\xc2\x92s trident-aiming at the king of the Danavas. The trident looked like\nthe Mid-day Sun of summer, flaming like a Pralaya fire. It looked irresistible\nand invincible as if quite powerful to kill the enemies. In brilliance it\nequalled the Sudars\xc2\x92an Chakra (disc) and it was the chief of all the weapons.\nNo other body than S\xc2\x92iva and Kes\xc2\x92ava could wield such a weapon. And everybody\nfeared that but S\xc2\x92iva and Kes\xc2\x92ava. In length it was one thousand Dhanus and in\nwidth it was one hundred hands. It seemed lively, of the nature of Brahma,\neternal and not capable to be noticed, whence and how it proceeded. The weapon\ncould destroy, by its own free Lila (Will) all the worlds. When S\xc2\x92iva held it\naloft and aiming at S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, He hurled it on him, the King of the\nDemons quitted his bows and arrows and with mind collected in a yoga posture,\nbegan to meditate on the lotus-feet of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a with great devotion. At\nthat moment, the trident, whirling round fell on S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a and easily\nburnt him and his chariot to ashes. He, then assuming the form of a two-armed\nGopa, full of youth, divine, ornamented with jewels, holding flute, mounted on\na Divine Chariot, surrounded by ko _t_ is\n\n\n\np. 897\n\n\n\nand ko _t_ is of Gopas who came there from the region of Goloka, whose bodies\nwere built up of excellent jewels, and S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a then went up to the\nHeavens (Goloka, where S\xc2\x92ri Brindabana is located in the middle). He went to\nVrindaban, full of Rasas (sentiments) and bowed down at the lotus feet of\nRadha Kri _sn_ a with devotion. Both of them were filled with love when they\nsaw Sudama, and, with a gracious countenance and joyful eyes, they took him on\ntheir laps. On the other hand the S\xc2\x92ula weapon came with force and gladness\nback again to Kri _sn_ a. The bones of S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, O Narada! were\ntransformed into conch-shells. These conch-shells are always considered very\nsacred and auspicious in the worship of the Devas. The water in the conch-\nshell is also very holy and pleasing to the Devas. What more than this, that\nthe water in the conch-shell is as holy as the water of any Tirtha. This water\ncan be offered to all the Gods but not to S\xc2\x92iva. Wherever the conch-shell is\nblown, there Lak _s_ mi abides with great pleasure. If bathing be done with\nconch-shell water, it is equivalent to taking bath in all the Tirthas.\nBhagavan Hari resides direct in the conch-shell. Where S\xc2\x92ankha is placed,\nthere Hari resides. Lak _s_ mi also resides there and all inauspicious things\nfly away from there. Where the females and S\xc2\x92udras blow the S\xc2\x92ankhas, Lak _s_\nmi then gets vexed and, out of terror, She goes away to other places. O\nNarada! Mahadeva, after killing the Danava, went to His own abode. When He\ngladly went away on His Vehicle, on the Bull\xc2\x92s back, with His whole host, all\nthe other Devas went to their respective places with great gladness. Celestial\ndrums were sounded in the Heavens. The Gandharbas and the Kinnaras began to\nsing songs. And showers of flowers were strewn on S\xc2\x92iva\xc2\x92s head. All the Munis\nand Devas and their chiefs began to chant hymns to Him.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-Third Chapter of the Ninth Book on the killing of\nS\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 24](bk09ch24.htm)\n\n'
