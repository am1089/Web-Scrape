Or (the world may originate from Brahman)\n\np. 382\n\nas the great and the long originate from the short and the atomic.\n\nThe system of the Vai _s_ eshikas is the following;--The atoms which possess,\naccording to their special kind  1, the qualities of colour, &c., and which\nare of spherical form  2, subsist during a certain period  3 without producing\nany effects  4. After that, the unseen principle (ad _ri_ sh _ta_ ), &c.  5,\nacting as operative causes and conjunction constituting the non-inherent cause\n6, they produce the entire aggregate of effected things, beginning with binary\natomic compounds. At the same time the qualities of the causes (i.e. of the\nsimple atoms) produce corresponding qualities in the effects. Thus, when two\natoms produce a binary atomic compound, the special qualities belonging to the\nsimple atoms, such as white colour, &c., produce a corresponding white colour\nin the binary compound. One special quality, however, of the simple atoms,\nviz. atomic sphericity, does not produce corresponding sphericity in the\nbinary compound; for the forms of extension belonging to the latter arc said\nto be minuteness (a _n_ utva) and shortness. And, again, when two binary\ncompounds combining produce a quaternary atomic compound, the qualities, such\nas whiteness, &c., inherent in the binary compounds produce corresponding\nqualities in the quaternary compounds; with the exception, however, of the two\nqualities of minuteness and shortness. For it is\n\np. 383\n\nadmitted that the forms of extension belonging to quaternary compounds are not\nminuteness and shortness, but bigness (mahattva) and length. The same happens\n1 when many simple atoms or many binary compounds or a simple atom and a\nbinary compound combine to produce new effects.\n\nWell, then, we say, just as from spherical atoms binary compounds are\nproduced, which are minute and short, and ternary compounds which are big and\nlong, but not anything spherical; or as from binary compounds, which are\nminute and short, ternary compounds, &c., are produced which are big and long,\nnot minute and short; so this non-intelligent world may spring from the\nintelligent Brahman. This is a doctrine to which you--the Vai _s_ eshika--\ncannot, on your own principles, object.\n\nHere the Vai _s_ eshika will perhaps come forward with the following\nargumentation  2. As effected substances, such as binary compounds and so on,\nare engrossed by forms of extension contrary to that of the causal substances,\nthe forms of extension belonging to the latter, viz. sphericity and so on,\ncannot produce similar qualities in the effects. The world, on the other hand,\nis not engrossed by any quality contrary to intelligence owing to which the\nintelligence inherent in the cause should not be able to originate a new\nintelligence in the effect. For non-intelligence is not a quality contrary to\nintelligence, but merely its negation. As thus the case of sphericity is not\nan exactly parallel one, intelligence may very well produce an effect similar\nto itself.\n\nThis argumentation, we rejoin, is not sound. Just as the qualities of\nsphericity and so on, although existing in the cause, do not produce\ncorresponding effects, so it is with\n\np. 384\n\nintelligence also; so that the two cases are parallel so far. Nor can the\ncircumstance of the effects being engrossed by a different form of extension\nbe alleged as the reason of sphericity, &c. not originating qualities similar\nto themselves; for the power of originating effects belongs to sphericity, &c.\nbefore another form of extension begins to exist. For it is admitted that the\nsubstance produced remains for a moment devoid of qualities, and that\nthereupon only (i.e. after that moment) its qualities begin to exist. Nor,\nagain, can it be said that sphericity, &c. concentrate their activity on\noriginating other forms of extension  1, and therefore do not originate forms\nof extension belonging to the same class as their own; for it is admitted that\nthe origin of other forms is due to other causes; as the Sutras of Ka _n_ abhu\n_g_ (Ka _n_ ada) themselves declare (Vai _s_. Sut. VII, 1, 9, 'Bigness is\nproduced from plurality inherent in the causes, from bigness of the cause and\nfrom a kind of accumulation;' VII, 1, 10, 'The contrary of this (the big) is\nthe minute;' VII, 1, 17, 'Thereby length and shortness are explained  2').--\nNor, again, can it be said that plurality, &c. inherent in the cause originate\n(like effects) in consequence of some peculiar proximity (in which they are\nsupposed to stand to the effected substance), while sphericity, &c. (not\nstanding in a like proximity) do not; for when a new substance or a new\nquality is originated,\n\np. 385\n\nall the qualities of the cause stand in the same relation of inherence to\ntheir abode (i.e. the causal substance in which they inhere). For these\nreasons the fact of sphericity, &c. not originating like effects can be\nexplained from the essential nature of sphericity, &c. only, and the same may\ntherefore be maintained with regard to intelligence  1 Moreover, from that\nobserved fact also, that from conjunction (sa _m_ yoga) there originate\nsubstances, &c. belonging to a class different (from that to which conjunction\nitself belongs), it follows that the doctrine of effects belonging to the same\nclass as the causes from which they spring is too wide. If you remark against\nthis last argument that, as we have to do at present with a substance (viz.\nBrahman), it is inappropriate to instance a quality (viz. conjunction) as a\nparallel case; we point out that at present we only wish to explain the\norigination of effects belonging to a different class in general. Nor is there\nany reason for the restriction that substances only are to be adduced as\nexamples for substances, and qualities only for qualities. Your own Sutrakara\nadduces a quality as furnishing a parallel case for a substance (Vai _s_. Sut.\nIV, 2, 2, 'On account of the conjunction of things perceptible and things\nimperceptible being imperceptible the body is not composed of five elements').\nJust as the conjunction which inheres in the perceptible earth and the\nimperceptible ether is not perceptible, the body also, if it had for its\ninherent cause the five elements which are part of them perceptible, part of\nthem imperceptible, would itself be imperceptible; but, as a matter of fact,\nit is perceptible; hence it is not composed of the five elements. Here\nconjunction is a quality and the body a substance.--The origin of effects\ndifferent in nature (from the cause) has, moreover, been already treated of\nunder II, 1; 6.--Well then, this being so, the matter has been settled there\nalready (why then is it again discussed here?)-Because, we reply, there we\nargued\n\np. 386\n\nagainst the Sa _n_ khya, and at present we have to do with the Vai _s_ eshika.\n--But, already once, before (II, 1, 3) a line of argument equally applicable\nto a second case was simply declared to extend to the latter also; (why then\ndo you not simply state now that the arguments used to defeat the Sa _n_ khya\nare equally valid against the Vai _s_ eshika?)--Because here, we reply, at the\nbeginning of the examination of the Vai _s_ eshika system we prefer to discuss\nthe point with arguments specially adapted to the doctrine of the Vai _s_\neshikas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[382:1](sbe34187.htm#fr_353) I.e. according as they are atoms of earth, water,\nfire, or air.\n\n[382:2](sbe34187.htm#fr_354) Parima _nd_ ala, spherical is the technical term\nfor the specific form of extension of the atoms, and, secondarily, for the\natoms themselves.

In other cases mahattva is due to antecedent mahattva, in\nothers to pra _k_ aya, i. e. accumulation. See the Upaskara on Vai _s_.
