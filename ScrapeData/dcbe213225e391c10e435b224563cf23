Vyasa said :-- After the king Subahu had spoken thus, the Queen made her\ndaughter S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala, who had always sweet smiles on her lips sit on her lap\nand after consoling her with sweet words, began to say \xc2\x93O fair eyed! You\nalways practise vows and other religious performances; why are you, then,\nspeaking these unpleasant words? The King has heard all what you wanted to say\nand has been very sorry.\n\n\n\n3-5. That Sudars'ana is very unfortunate, deprived of his kingdom, helpless,\nvoid of wealth and army, abandoned by his friends, exiled with his mother in\nthe forest, subsisting on roots and fruits, lean and thin. Thus he is not\nworthy of becoming the husband of yours. There are many learned, beautiful,\napproved of all, qualified with all royal marks, princes fit to become your\nhusband. They all will come in this Svayamvara.\n\n\n\n6\\. There is one brother of this Sudars'ana, who is endowed with all kingly\nqualifications, beautiful, and qualified in various other ways. He is the king\nof the Kosala country.\n\n\n\n7\\. There is another point worth consideration; please hear it. The King\nYudhajit is trying his best to kill Sudars'ana on a befitting opportunity.\n\n\n\np. 196\n\n\n\n8\\. He already counselled with his ministers and killed in a desperate fight\nthe king Virasena and installed his daughter\xc2\x92s son on the throne.\n\n\n\n9\\. Even he came up so far as the hermitage of Bharadvaja to kill Sudars'ana;\nafterwards he was prevented by the Munis from doing so then he returned home.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n10-11. S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala replied :-- \xc2\x93Mother! That prince, though staying in the\nforest, is approved of by me; under the advice S\xc2\x92aryati, the chaste Sukanya\nmarried Chyavana Muni and served her husband all along; so I will marry this\nking\xc2\x92s son and will always be engaged in serving him. The women are able to\nattain heaven and emancipation, if they serve their husbands; therefore if we\nbe sincere in serving our husbands, we will no doubt be happy.\n\n\n\n12\\. I have seen in my dream that the Goddess Bhagavati has ordained him to be\nmy husband; how can I now accept any other body as my husband than him?\n\n\n\n13\\. The Devi Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari has pictured his frame firmly in my heart; I will\nnever be able to leave my dearest beautiful husband and to contract marriage\nwith any other person.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n14\\. Vyasa said :-- Thus the mother, the daughter of the King of Videha, found\nmany signs and at last desisted. She then reported to the King all the words\nof S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala.\n\n\n\n15-16. When S\xc2\x92as\xc2\x92ikala, on the day before the marriage day, became very\nanxious and, sent in a great hurry, one trustworthy Brahmi _n_ , versed in the\nVedas to the hermitage of Bharadvaja with this message \xc2\x93O Brahma _n_ , go in\nsuch a way to Sudars\xc2\x92ana, as my father be not able to know about it and tell\nSudars'ana all my words.\n\n\n\n17-18. My father has called in for my marriage a Svayambara ceremony; many\npowerful kings will attend with their armies; O Deva! The Goddess Bhagavati\nhas ordered me in dream and accordingly I, with full gladness of my heart,\nhave become yours already in my heart.\n\n\n\n19\\. Rather I will take poison or I will jump in a blazing fire, than I can\nobey my father\xc2\x92s and mother\xc2\x92s words and marry another.\n\n\n\n20\\. By my mind, word, and deed, I have selected you my husband; and pleasure\nand happiness is sure to attend on us by the blessings of the Bhagavati.\n\n\n\n21\\. Please depend unto Her, at Whose command this whole universe, moving and\nunmoving is resting, unto that Great Destiny and come to this place without\nfail.\n\n\n\n22\\. What the Goddess, whose commands S\xc2\x92ankara all the other Devas obey, has\nordered, can never turn out false.\n\n\n\np. 197\n\n\n\n23\\. O Brahmi _n_! You the foremost amongst the virtuous; do therefore call on\nthat King\xc2\x92s son in privacy and speak out all there to him. What shall I say\nmore to you. Do all that my object may be fullfilled.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n24\\. Thus saying, she gave the Brahmi _n_ his Dak _s_ ina and sent him to\nSudars\xc2\x92ana. He went there and reported all the matter duly to him and quickly\nreturned back.\n\n\n\n25\\. On coming to know all this, Sudars\xc2\x92ana determined to start; and the Mahar\n_s_ i Bharadvaja, with gladness, sent him.\n\n\n\n26\\. Vyasa said :-- Seeing her son ready to start, the mother Manorama became\nvery sorry and, trembling and shedding tears, thus spoke to her son.\n\n\n\n27-28. \xc2\x93Sudars\xc2\x92ana! Where are you going now? How do you dare to go there in\nthe Svayamvara alone, where are present kings and all your terrible enemies. O\nSon! You are as yet a boy. The King Yudhajit will certainly go there with the\nobject of killing you; there will then is no other body to help you. So you\nshould never go to that place.\n\n\n\n29\\. You are my only son; I am very poor and helpless; I have no other to lean\nupon than you; therefore you ought not to throw me in despair at this moment.\n\n\n\n30\\. See Sudars\xc2\x92ana! The King Yudhajit who had slain my father, that\nuncontrollable king will come there; if you go there alone, he will certainly\nkill you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n31\\. Sudars'ana replied \xc2\x93Mother! What is inevitable will certainly come to\npass; there is no need to discuss further on the subject. I will go at the\ncommand of the World Mother to that assembly hall\n\nSvayamvara.\n\n\n\n32\\. O Auspicious one! Do not give vent to sorrow; I do fear none by the grace\nof the Bhagavati.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n33\\. Vyasa said :-- Thus saying, Sudars\xc2\x92ana mounted on his chariot and was\nready to start. Seeing this Manorama began to bless him and so cheer him.\n\n\n\n34-37. O Son! Let Ambika Devi protect your front; Padmalochana protect your\nback; Parvati, your two sides; S\xc2\x92iva Devi, all around you; Varahi, in dreadful\npaths; Durga, in royal forts, Kalika, in terrible fights; Parames'vari, in the\nplatform hall; Matamgi, in the Svayamvara hall; Bhavani, the Avertress of\nworld, amidst the kings; Girija, in mountain passes; Chamun _d_ a, in the\nsacrificial ground, and let the eternal Kamaga, protect you in the forests.\n\n\n\np. 198\n\n\n\n38\\. O Descendant of Raghu family! Let the Vai _s_ navi force protect you in\nquarrels; let Bhairavi protect you in battles and amongst your enemies.\n\n\n\n39\\. O Son! Let the Maha Maya Jagaddhatri Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari protect you everywhere\nand at all times.\n\n\n\n40\\. Vyasa said :-- Then Manorama, speaking thus to him, trembled with fear\nand again said :-- \xc2\x93O Sudars\xc2\x92ana, I will also accompany you; there will not be\notherwise.\n\n\n\n41\\. I will never be able to remain anywhere without you and even for the\ntwinkling of an eye. O Son, carrry me thither where you are desiring to go.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n42\\. Thus saying, his mother with her attendants was ready to start. The\nBrahma _n_ as pronounced their blessings. All then went out.\n\n\n\n43\\. Sudars\xc2\x92an, the descendant of the Raghu family, mounted then alone on his\nchariot and reached Benares. There the King Subahu, hearing that he had come,\nwelcomed him and worshipped him with various presents.\n\n\n\n44\\. He gave him, the house for his residence, and made arrangements for his\nfood and drink and other necessary requirements and gave order to his servants\nto wait on the prince.\n\n\n\n45\\. Then, from various quarters, the kings assembled together; and Yudhajit,\ntoo, came there accompanied by his daughter\xc2\x92s son, S\xc2\x92atrujit.\n\n\n\n46-48. The King of Karu _s_ a, the King of Madra, the King of Sindhu, the King\nof Mahismati, the valiant warriors, the King of Panchala, the kings of the\nmountainous tract, the King of Karnat, the powerful King of Kamarupa, the King\nof Chola, and the very powerful King of Vidarbhas with 180 Ak _s_ auhini\nsoldiers all arrived and assembled there. Benares was then crowded all over\nwith soldiers and soldiers.\n\n\n\n49\\. Many other kings came there on their beautiful elephants to witness the\nSvayamvara ceremony.\n\n\n\n50\\. Then the princes began to talk amongst them \xc2\x93The King\xc2\x92s son Sudars\xc2\x92ana,\ntoo, had come there and is staying unconfused and calm.\n\n\n\n51\\. Is it that the high minded Sudars\xc2\x92ana, born of the Kakutstha family, had\ncome there on a chariot, helpless, to marry?\n\n\n\n52\\. Can it be that the princess will overlook these Kings with soldiers and\nweapons, and select the long armed Sudars\xc2\x92ana?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n53\\. Then the King Yudhajit addressed all the other kings \xc2\x93I will slay\nSudars\xc2\x92ana for the sake of the daughter; there is no doubt in this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 199\n\n\n\n54-55. Hearing Yudhajit's words, the king of Keral, the foremost of those who\nknow morals, began to say :-- \xc2\x93O king! In this Ichchha svayamvara, it is not\nproper to fight. Here there will be no marriage for the prowess; there is no\narrangement fixed to steal away the bride elect by force; here the bride will\nselect of her own free choice; what cause can then there crop up here for\nquarrels?\n\n\n\n56\\. Before, you had driven him out of his kingdom; and though you are the\nsuperior king, you have taken his kingdom by force and installed your\ndaughter\xc2\x92s son on the throne.\n\n\n\n57\\. O King! This Sudars\xc2\x92an is born of the Kakutstha family and the son of the\nKing of Kosala. Why would you kill this innocent boy?\n\n\n\n58\\. O Long lived! Better be sure that there is some God of this Universe; He\nis governing all; and if you commit anything wrongful know that you will get\nthe fruit of that due to you; there is no doubt it\n\nthis.\n\n\n\n59\\. O King! There is victory everywhere of the Truth and Dharma, always you\nfind Adharma and Falsehood defeated. Therefore dost thou forsake your evil and\nmean intentions and pacify your vile mind.\n\n\n\n60\\. Your daughter's son is also present here; he is beautiful and prosperous\nand is reigning a kingdom. Why will not that bride elect him as bridegroom?\n\n\n\n61-62. Consider again that there are many other powerful princes and kings in\nthis Svayamvara; the princess may select them also. Therefore let all the\nkings assembled here say that if the selection of the bridegroom be performed\nin that way, what cause of a quarrel can there crop up? Knowing all these, you\nought not to quarrel here.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus ends the Nineteenth Chapter on the going to the Svayamvara assembly of\nSudars\xc2\x92ana and the other kings in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 20](bk03ch20.htm)\n\n"
