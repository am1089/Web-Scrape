Prayer for long life.\n\n1\\. When, O Brihaspati, thou didst liberate (us) from existence in yonder\nworld of Yama, (and) from hostile schemes, then did the Asvins, the physicians\nof the gods, with might sweep death from us, O Agni!  \n2\\. O in-breathing and out-breathing, go along with the body, do not leave it:\nmay they be thy allies here! Live and thrive a hundred autumns; Agni shall be\nthy most excellent shepherd and overseer!  \n3\\. Thy vital force that has been dissipated afar, thy in-breathing and thy\nout-breathing, shall come back again! Agni has snatched them from the lap of\nNirriti (the goddess of destruction), and I again introduce them into thy\nperson.  \n4\\. Let not his in-breathing desert him, nor his out-breathing quit him and\ndepart! I commit him to the Seven Rishis: may they convey him in health to old\nage!  \n5\\. Enter, O in-breathing and out-breathing, like two bulls into a stable:\nthis person shall here flourish, an unmolested repository for old age!  \n6\\. Life's breath we do drive into thee, disease we do drive away from thee.\nMay this excellent Agni endow us with life from every source!  \n7\\. Ascending from the darkness of death to the highest firmament, to Surya\n(the sun), the god among gods, we have reached the highest light.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 1.
