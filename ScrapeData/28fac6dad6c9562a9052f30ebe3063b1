Charm for depriving a man of his virility.\n\n1\\. As the best of the plants thou art reputed, O herb: turn this man for me\nto-day into a eunuch that wears his hair dressed!  \n2\\. Turn him into a eunuch that wears his hair dressed, and into one that\nwears a hood! Then Indra with a pair of stones shall break his testicles both!  \n3\\. O eunuch, into a eunuch thee I have turned;O castrate, into a castrate\nthee I have turned; O weakling, into a weakling thee I have turned! A hood\nupon his head, and a hair-net do we place.  \n4\\. The two canals, fashioned by the gods, in which man's power rests, in thy\ntesticles . . . . . . . . . . . . I break them with a club.  \n5\\. As women break reeds for a mattress with a stone, thus do I break thy\nmember.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 18. Charm to remove evil bodily characteristics from a\nwoman](av132.htm)\n\n"
