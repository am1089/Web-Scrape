Naraya _n_ a said :-- Thus highly pleased, Tulasi went to sleep with a\ngladdened-heart. She, the daughter of Vri _s_ adhvaja, was then in her\nblooming youth and while asleep, the Cupid, the God of five arrows, shot at\nher five arrows (by which one gets enchanted and swooned). Though the Devi was\nsmeared with sandal paste and She slept on a bed strewn with flowers, her body\nwas felt as if being burnt. Out of joy, the hairs stood on their ends all over\nher body; her eyes were reddened and her body began to quiver. Sometimes She\nfelt uneasiness, sometimes dryness; sometimes She got faint; sometimes\ndrowsiness and sometimes again pleasantness; sometimes she became conscious,\nsometimes sorrowful. Sometimes she got up from her bed; sometimes she sat; and\nsometimes she fell again to sleep. The flower-bed, strewn with sandal-paste,\nappeared to her full of thorns; nice delicious fruits and cold water appeared\nto her like poison. Her house appeared to her like a hole in a ground and her\nfine garments seemed to her like fire. The mark of Sindura on her forehead\nappeared, as it were, a boil, a sore. She began to see in her dreams that one\nbeautiful, well clothed, humorous, young man with smile in his lips, appeared\nto her. His body was besmeared with sandal-paste and decked with excellent\njewels; garlands of forest flowers were suspending from his neck. Coming\nthere, he was drinking the honey of her lotus face. He was speaking on love\nthemes and on various other sweet topics. As if he was embracing amorously and\nenjoying the pleasures of intercourse. After the intercourse he was going\naway; again he was coming near.\n\n\n\np. 874\n\n\n\nThe lady was addressing him, \xc2\x93O Darling! O Lord of my heart! Where do you go.\nCome close.\xc2\x94 Again when she became conscious, she began to lament bitterly.\nThus on entering in her youth, the Devi Tulasi began to live in the hermitage\nof Badari (Plum fruit, it may signify womb. Those who visit Badari are not to\nenter again in any womb). On the other hand the great Yogi S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a\nobtained the Kri _sn_ a Mantra from Mahar _s_ i Jaigi _s_ avya and got siddhi\n(success) in Pu _s_ kara Tirtha (sacred place of pilgrimage where one crosses\nthe world). Holding on his neck the Kavacha named Sarvamangalamaya and\nobtaining the boon from Brahma as he desired, he arrived at Badari, by\nBrahma\xc2\x92s command. The signs of the blooming youth had just begun to be visible\nin the body of S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a as if the God of Love incarnated in his body;\nhis colour resembled that of white Champakas and all his body was decked with\njewelled ornaments. His face resembled the autumnal full moon; his eyes were\nextended like the lotus leaves. The beautiful form was seen to sit in an\nexcellent aerial car, made of pearls and jewels. Two jewel earrings, nice and\nelegant, suspended upto his cheek; his neck was adorned with Parijata flower\ngarlands; and his body was smeared with Kumkum and scented sandal-paste. O\nNarada! Seeing S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a coming near to her, Tulasi covered her face by\nher clothing and she, with a smiling countenance, cast repeatedly sidelong\nglances at him and bent her head low abashed in the expectation of a fresh\nintercourse. How beautiful was that clear face of her! It put down the\nautumnal moon in the background. The invaluable jewelled ornament were on her\ntoes. Her braid of hair was surrounded by sweet scented Malati garlands. The\ninvaluable jewelled wonderful earrings like the shape of a shark were hanging\nup to her cheek. Extraordinarily beautiful necklaces were seen being suspended\nto the middle of her breasts and added to the beauty thereof; on her arms and\nhand were jewelled bangles and conch ornaments; jewelled armlets and on\nfingers; excellent jewelled rings were seen. O Muni! Seeing that lovely\nbeautiful chaste woman of good nature, S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a came to her and taking\nhis seat addressed her as follows :--\n\n\n\n27\\. \xc2\x93O Proud One! O Auspicious One! Who are you? Whose daughter are you? You\nlook fortunate and blessed among women. I am your silent slave. Talk with me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n28-30. That beautiful eyed Tulasi, full of love, replied to S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a\nwith smiling countenance and face bent low :-- \xc2\x93I am the daughter of the great\nking Vri _s_ adhvaja. I have come to this forest for tapasya and am engaged in\nthis. Who are you? What business have you to talk with me? You can go away\nwherever you like. I have heard\n\n\n\np. 875\n\n\n\nin the S\xc2\x92astras that persons born of a noble family never speak with ladies of\na respectable family in privacy.\n\n\n\n31-71. Only those that are lewd, void of any knowledge in the Dharma S\xc2\x92astras,\nvoid of the Vedic knowledge and who are not Kulinas, like to speak with women\nin privacy. And those woman, too, that look externally beautiful but very\npassionate and the Death of males, who are sweet tongued but filled with venom\nin their hearts, those who are sweet externally but like a sword internally,\nthose that are always bent in achieving their own selfish ends and those that\nbecome obedient to their husbands for their own selfish ends otherwise\nbehaving as they like, those that are filled inside with dirty things and\noutside looking pleasant in their faces and eyes, whose characters are\npronounced as defiled, what intelligent, learned and noble-minded man can\ntrust them? Those women do not discriminate who are their friends or who are\ntheir enemies; they want always new persons. Whenever they see a man well\ndressed, they want to satisfy their own passions. And they pretend with great\ncare that they are very chaste. They are the vessels of passion; they always\nattract the minds of others and they are very enthusiastic in satisfying their\nown lust. They verbally shew that they want other men to go away but at\nhearts, feelings for intercourse remain preponderant; whenever they see their\nparamours in private, they laugh and become very glad but externally their\nshame, knows no bounds. When they do not have their intercourses with their\nparamours, they become self-conceited; their bodies burn with anger and they\nbegin to quarrel. When their passions are satisfied fully, they become glad\nand when there is a deficiency in that, they become sorrowful. For the sake of\ngood and sweet food and cold drinks, they want beautiful young persons,\nqualified and humorous. They consider witty young persons clever in holding\nintercourses, more dearly than their sons. And if that beloved one becomes\nincapable or aged, then he is considered as an enemy. Quarrels and anger then\nensue. They devour these men as serpents eat rats. They are boldness\npersonified and they are the source of all evils and vices. Even Brahma, Vi\n_sn_ u and Mahes\xc2\x92a remain deluded before them. They cannot find out any clue\nof their minds. They are the greatest obstacle in the path of tapasya and the\nclosed doors for liberation. Devotion to Hari cannot reach those women. They\nare the repositories of Maya and they hold men fast by iron chains in this\nword. They are like magicians and false like dreams. They enchant others by\nexternal beauty; their lower parts are very ugly and filled with excrements,\nfaeces, of foul scent and very unholy and smeared with blood. The Creator\nBhagavan has created them as such, the Maya to\n\n\n\np. 876\n\n\n\nthe Mayavis and the venom to those who want liberation, and as invisible to\nthose that want to have them.\xc2\x94 Thus saying Tulasi stopped. O Narada!\nS\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, then smilingly addressed her as follows :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! What\nyou have spoken is not wholly false; partly it is true and partly it is false.\nNow hear. The Creator has created this all-enchanting female form into two\nparts. One is praiseworthy and the other is not. He has created Lak _s_ mi,\nSarasvati, Durga, Savitri and Radha and others as the primary causes of\ncreation; so there are the prime creations: Those women that are born of their\nparts, are auspicious, glorious and much praiseworthy. S\xc2\x92atarupa, Devahuti,\nSvadha, Svaha, Dak _s_ i _n_ a Chhayavati, Rohi _n_ i, Varunani, S\xc2\x92achi, the\nwife of Kuvera, Diti, Aditi, Lopamudra, Anasuya, Kau _t_ abhi (Ko _t_ ari),\nTulasi, Ahalya, Arundhati, Mena, Tara, Mandodari, Damayanti, Vedavati, Ganga,\nManasa, Pu _st_ i, Tu _st_ i, Smriti, Medha, Kalika, Vasundhara, Sa _st_ hi,\nMangalacha _n_ di, Murti, wife of Dharma. Svasti, S\xc2\x92raddha; S\xc2\x92anti, Kanti, K\n_s_ anti, Nidra, Tandra, K _s_ udha, Pipasa, Sandhya, Ratri, Diva, Sampatti,\nDhriti, Kirti, Kriya, S\xc2\x92obha, Prabha, S\xc2\x92iva, and other women born of the Prime\nPrakritis, all are excellent in every Yuga. The prostitutes of the heavens are\nalso born of the above women in their parts and parts of parts. They are not\npraiseworthy in the universe; they are all regarded as unchaste women. Those\nwomen that are of Sattva Gu _n_ as are all excellent and endowed with\ninfluence. In the universe they are good, chaste and praiseworthy. This is not\nfalse. The Pandits declare them excellent. Those that are of Rajo Gu _n_ as,\nand Tamo Gu _n_ as are not so praiseworthy. Those women that are of Rajo Gu\n_n_ as are known as middling. They are always fond of enjoyments, yield to\nthem, and always ready to achieve their own ends. These women are generally\ninsincere, delusive, and outside the pale of religious duties. Therefore they\nare generally unchaste. The Pandits consider them as middling. Those women\nthat are of Tamo Gu _n_ as are considered as worst. Those born of noble\nfamilies, can never speak with other wives in a private place or when they are\nalone. By Brahma\xc2\x92s command I have come to you. O Fair One! I will marry you\nnow according to the Gandharba method. My name is S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a. The Devas\nfly away from me out of terror. Before I was the intimate S\xc2\x92akha (friend) of\nS\xc2\x92ri Hari, by the name of Sudama. Now, by Radhika\xc2\x92s curse I am born in the\nfamily of the Danavas. I was a Pari _s_ ad (attendant) of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a and\nthe chief of the eight Gopas. Now, by Radhika\xc2\x92s curse I am born as S\xc2\x92ankhachu\n_d_ a, the Indra of the Danavas. By S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a\xc2\x92s grace and by His mantra,\nI am Jatismara (know of my past births). You, too, are Jatismara Tulasi. S\xc2\x92ri\nKri _sn_ a enjoyed you before. By\n\n\n\np. 877\n\n\n\nRadhika\xc2\x92s anger, you are now born in Bharata. I was very eager to enjoy you\nthen; out of Radhika\xc2\x92s fear I could not.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n72-87. Thus saying, S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a stopped. Then Tulasi gladly and smilingly\nreplied :-- \xc2\x93Such persons (like you) are famous in this world; good women\ndesire such husbands. Really, I am now defeated by you in argument. The man\nwho is conquered by woman is very impure and blamed by the community. The\nPitri Lokas, the Deva Lokas, and the Gandharba Loka, too, look upon men,\noverpowered by women, as mean, despicable. Even father, mother, brother, etc.,\nhate them mentally. It is said in the Vedas that the impurities during birth\nand death are expiated by a ten days observances for the Brahma _n_ as, by\ntwelve days observances for the K _s_ attriyas, by fifteen days observances\nfor the Vais\xc2\x92yas and by one month\xc2\x92s observances for the S\xc2\x92udras and other low\ncastes. But the impurity of the man who is conquered by women cannot be\nexpiated by any other means except (his dead body) being burned in the funeral\npyre. The Pitris never accept willingly the pi _nd_ as and offerings of water\n(Tarpa _n_ as) offered by the women-conquered men. So much so that the Devas\neven hesitate to accept flowers, water, etc., offered by them on their names.\nThose whose hearts are entirely subdued by men, do not acquire any fruits from\ntheir knowledge, Tapasya, Japam, fire sacrifices, worship, learning and fame.\nI tested you to ascertain your strength in learning. It is highly advisable to\nchoose one\xc2\x92s husband by examining his merits and defects. Sin equivalent to\nthe murder of a Brahmi _n_ is committed if one gives in marriage one\xc2\x92s\ndaughter to one void of all qualifications, to an old man, to one who is\nignorant, to a poor, illiterate, diseased, ugly, very angry, very harsh, lame,\ndevoid of limbs, deaf, dumb, inanimate like, and who is impotent. If one gives\nin marriage a daughter to a young man of good character, learned, well\nqualified and of a peaceful temper, one acquires the fruits of performing ten\nhorse sacrifices. If one nourishes a daughter and sells her out of greed for\nmoney, one falls to the Kumbhipaka hell. That sinner drinks the urine and eats\nthe excrements of that daughter, remaining in that hell. For a period equal to\nthe fourteen Indra\xc2\x92s life-periods they are bitten by worms and crows. At the\nexpiry of this period, they will have to be born in this world of men as\ndiseased persons. In their human births they will have to earn their\nlivelihood by selling flesh and carrying flesh.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n88-100. Thus saying, when Tulasi stopped, Brahma appeared on the scene and\naddressed S\xc2\x92ankachuda :-- O S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a! Why are you spending uselessly\nyour time in vain talks with Tulasi? Marry her soon by the Gandharba method.\nAs you are a gem amongst\n\n\n\np. 878\n\n\n\nmales, so She is a gem amongst females. It is a very happy union between a\nhumorous lover and a humorous beloved. O King! Who despises the great\nhappiness when it is at one\xc2\x92s hand! He who forsakes the pleasure is worse than\na beast in this world. O Tulasi! And what for are you testing the nobly\nqualified person who is the tormentor of the Devas, Asuras and Danavas. O\nChild! As Lak _s_ mi Devi is of Naraya _n_ a, as Radhika is of Kri _sn_ a; as\nis My Savitri, as Bhava\xc2\x92s is Bhavani, as Boar's is Earth, as Yaj\xc3\xb1a\xc2\x92s is Dak\n_s_ i _n_ a, Atri\xc2\x92s Anasuya, Gautama\xc2\x92s Ahalya, Moon\xc2\x92s Rohi _n_ i, Brihaspati\xc2\x92s\nTara, Manu\xc2\x92s S\xc2\x92atarupa, Kandarpa\xc2\x92s Rati, Kas\xc2\x92yapa\xc2\x92s Aditi, Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha\xc2\x92s\nArundhati, Karddama\xc2\x92s Devahuti, Fire\xc2\x92s Svaha, Indra\xc2\x92s S\xc2\x92achi, Ga _n_ es\xc2\x92a\xc2\x92s Pu\n_st_ i, Skanda\xc2\x92s Devasena, and Dharma\xc2\x92s Murti, so let you be the dear wife of\nS\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a. Let you remain with S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, beautiful as he is,\nfor a long time, and enjoy with him in various places as you like. When\nS\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a will quit his mortal frame, you would go to Goloka and enjoy\neasily with the two-armed S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, and in Vaiku _nt_ ha with the four-\narmed Kri _sn_ a and with great gladness.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighteenth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the union of S\xc2\x92ankhachu\n_d_ a with Tulasi in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 19](bk09ch19.htm)\n\n"
