And because (on the above interpretation)\n\np. 231\n\nthere is no contradiction to both (i.e. man's making an effort to free himself\nfrom his deeds and actually freeing himself) according to his liking.\n\nMoreover if we assumed that the man frees himself from his good and evil deeds\non the way--after having departed from the body and having entered on the path\nof the gods--we should implicate ourselves in impossibilities; for after the\nbody has been left behind, man can no longer accomplish, according to his\nliking, that effort which consists in self-restraint and pursuit of knowledge,\nand which is the cause of the obliteration of all his good and evil deeds, and\nconsequently that obliteration also cannot take place. We therefore must\nassume that the requisite effort is made--and its result takes place--at an\nearlier moment, viz. in the state in which man is able to effect it, and that\nin consequence thereof man rids himself of his good and evil deeds.\n\nNothing then stands in the way of the conditioning and the conditioned events\ntaking place, and the assumption moreover agrees with the statements of the Ta\n_n_ _d_ ins and Sa _t_ yayanins.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 28](sbe38172.htm)\n\n"
