Now Soma was in the sky, and the gods were here on earth. The gods\ndesired,--'Would that Soma came to us: we might sacrifice with him, when\ncome.' They created those two illusions, Supar _n_ i and Kadru. In the chapter\non the hearths (dhish _n_ ya 2) it is set forth how that affair of Supar _n_ i\nand Kadru came to pass.\n\n3:2:4:22\\. Gayatri flew up to Soma for them. While she was carrying him off,\nthe Gandharva Vi _s_ vavasu stole him from her. The gods were aware of\nthis,--'Soma has indeed been removed from yonder (sky), but he comes not to\nus, for the Gandharvas have stolen him.'\n\np. 53\n\n3:2:4:33\\. They said, 'The Gandharvas are fond of women: let us send Va _k_\n(speech) to them, and she will return to us together with Soma.' They sent Va\n_k_ to them, and she returned to them together with Soma.\n\n3:2:4:44\\. The Gandharvas came after her and said, 'Soma (shall be) yours, and\nVa _k_ ours 1!' 'So be it!' said the gods; 'but if she would rather come\nhither, do not ye carry her off by force: let us woo her!' They accordingly\nwooed her.\n\n3:2:4:55\\. The Gandharvas recited the Vedas to her, saying, 'See how we know\nit, see how we know it 2!'\n\n3:2:4:66\\. The gods then created the lute and sat playing and singing, saying,\n'Thus we will sing to thee, thus we will amuse thee!' She turned to the gods;\nbut, in truth, she turned to them vainly, since she turned away from those,\nengaged in praising and praying, to dance and song. Wherefore even to this day\nwomen are given to vain things: for it was on this wise that Va _k_ turned\nthereto, and other women do as she did. And hence it is to him who dances and\nsings that they most readily take a fancy 3.\n\n3:2:4:77\\. Both Soma and Va _k_ were thus with the gods. Now, when he buys\nSoma he does so in order that he may sacrifice with him, when obtained, for\nhis (own) obtainment (of heavenly bliss 4); for he who\n\np. 54\n\nsacrifices with Soma that has not been bought, sacrifices with Soma that has\nnot been (properly) obtained 1.\n\n3:2:4:88\\. In the first place he pours the butter, which remains in the dhruva\nspoon, in four parts into the guhu; and having tied a piece of gold with a\nblade of the altar-grass 2, and laid it down (in the _g_ uhu), he offers (the\nbutter), thinking, 'I will offer with pure milk;' for milk and gold are of the\nsame origin, since both have sprung from Agni's seed 3.\n\n3:2:4:99\\. He lays down the piece of gold, with the text (Va _g_. S. IV, 17),\n'This (butter) is thy body, O shining (Agni)! this (gold) is thy light,'--for\nthat gold is indeed light:--'unite therewith and obtain splendour!' When he\nsays, 'Unite therewith,' he means to say, 'Mingle therewith;' and when he\nsays, 'Obtain splendour,'--splendour meaning Soma,--he means to say, 'Obtain\nSoma.'\n\n3:2:4:1010\\. And as the gods then sent her (Va _k_ ) to Soma, so does he now\nsend her to Soma; and the cow for which the Soma is bought being in reality Va\n_k_ , it is her he gratifies by this offering, thinking, 'With her, when\ngratified, I shall buy the Soma.'\n\n3:2:4:1111\\. He offers, with the text, 'Thou art the singer of praises 4,'--\nfor this (word ' _g_ u _h_ '), the 'singer of praises,' is one of her (Va _k_\n's) names;--'upholden by the Mind,'--this speech of ours\n\np. 55\n\nis indeed upheld by the mind, because the Mind goes before 1 Speech (and\nprompts her), 'Speak thus! say not this!' for, were it not for the Mind,\nSpeech would indeed talk incoherently: for this reason he says, 'Upholden by\nthe Mind.'\n\n3:2:4:1212\\. 'Well-pleasing to Vish _n_ u,' whereby he means to say, 'Well-\npleasing to Soma whom we approach 2.' [He proceeds, Va _g_. S. IV, 18],\n'Inspired by thee of true inspiration,' whereby he means to say, 'Be thou of\ntrue inspiration! go thou to Soma for us!'--'May I obtain a support for my\nbody, Svaha!' for he who reaches the end of the sacrifice, indeed obtains a\nsupport for his body: hence he thereby means to say, 'May I reach the end of\nthe sacrifice!'\n\n3:2:4:1313\\. Thereupon he takes out the piece of gold (from the spoon),\nwhereby he bestows gold on men; but were he to offer (the butter) together\nwith the gold, he would doubtless cast the gold away from men, and no gold\nwould then be gained among men.\n\n3:2:4:1414\\. He takes it out, with the text, Thou art pure, thou art shining,\nthou art immortal, thou art sacred to all the gods.' When, having offered the\nwhole milk, he now says, 'Thou art pure . . . ,' it is indeed pure, and\nshining, and immortal, and sacred to all the gods. Having loosened the grass-\nblade, he throws it on the barhis, and ties a string round the gold 3.\n\n3:2:4:1515\\. Having then taken butter a second time in\n\np. 56\n\nfour parts, he says, 'Sacrificer, hold on behind 1!' They open the (south and\neast) 2 doors of the hall (and walk out). On the right side (of the front\ndoor) approaches the Soma-cow 3: (by having) her thus put forward 4, he has\nsent her forth (to Soma); for the Soma-cow is in reality Va _k_ : it is her he\nhas gratified by this offering, thinking, 'With her, when gratified, I will\nbuy Soma.'\n\n3:2:4:1616\\. Having gone up to her, he (the Adhvaryu) salutes her, with the\ntext (Va _g_. S. IV, 19), 'Thou art thought, thou art the mind,'--for speech,\ndoubtless, speaks in accordance with thought, with the mind 5;--'Thou art\nintelligence, thou art the Dakshi _n_ a 6,'--for it is by means of their\nrespective intelligence 7 that people seek to make their living, either by\nreciting (the Veda), or by readiness of speech 8, or by songs: therefore he\nsays, 'Thou art intelligence;' and 'Dakshi _n_ a' (gift to the priests) he\ncalls her, because she is indeed the Dakshi _n_ a;--\n\np. 57\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Thou art supreme, thou art worthy of worship,'--for she\nis indeed supreme and worthy of worship;--'Thou art Aditi, the double-headed,'\n--inasmuch as, through her (Va _k_ , speech), he speaks the right thing\nwrongly, and puts last what comes first, and first what comes last, therefore\nshe is double-headed: that is why he says, 'Thou art Aditi, the double-headed\n1.'\n\n3:2:4:1717\\. 'Be thou for us successful (in going) forward and successful (in\ncoming) back!' when he says, 'Be thou for us successful (in going) forward,'\nhe means to say, 'Go to (fetch) Soma for us!' and when he says, 'Be thou\nsuccessful (in coming) back,' he means to say, 'Come back to us with Soma!'\nThis is why he says, 'Be thou for us successful (in going) forward and\nsuccessful (in coming) back!'\n\n3:2:4:1818\\. 'May Mitra bind thee by the foot!' For that rope, doubtless, is\nof Varu _n_ a; and were she (the cow) tied with a rope, she would be (under\nthe power) of Varu _n_ a. And, on the other hand, were she not tied at all,\nshe would be uncontrolled. Now that which is of Mitra is not of Varu _n_ a;\nand as (a cow), if tied with a rope, is under control, so it is in the case of\nthis one when he says, 'May Mitra bind thee by the foot!'\n\n3:2:4:1919\\. 'May Pushan guard thy paths!' Now Pushan is this Earth, and for\nwhomsoever she is the guardian of his paths 2, he stumbles not at any time:\ntherefore he says, 'May Pushan guard thy paths!'\n\n3:2:4:2020\\. 'For Indra as the supreme guide;'--whereby he says, 'May she be\nwell-guarded!' [He\n\np. 58\n\nproceeds, Va _g_. S. IV, 20], 'May thy mother grant thee permission, thy\nfather, thine own brother, thy fellow in the herd!' whereby he says, 'Go thou\nfor us to fetch Soma, with the permission of all thy kin.'--'O goddess, go to\nthe god,'--for it is indeed as a goddess, as Va _k_ , that she goes to a god,\nto Soma: therefore he says, 'O goddess, go to the god;'--'To Soma for the sake\nof Indra!' Indra truly is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, 'To\nSoma for the sake of Indra.' 'May Rudra guide thee back!' this he says for her\nsafety, for cattle cannot pass beyond Rudra 1. 'Hail to thee! come back, with\nSoma for thy companion!' whereby he says, 'Hail to thee, come back to us\ntogether with Soma!'\n\n3:2:4:2121\\. Even as, at that time, the gods sent her to Soma, and she\nreturned to them together with Soma, so does he now send her to Soma, and she\nreturns to him together with Soma.\n\n3:2:4:2222\\. And as the gods then wooed her with the Gandharvas, and she\nturned to the gods, so does the sacrificer now woo her, and she turns to the\nsacrificer. They lead her (the Soma-cow) northwards round (to the place where\nthe Soma is to be sold); for the north is the quarter of men, and hence it is\nthat of the sacrificer for this reason they lead her northwards round.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[52:2](sbe2610.htm#fr_135) See [III, 6, 2, 2](sbe2624.htm#3:6:2:2) seq.\n\n[53:1](sbe2610.htm#fr_136) 'Yours (shall be) Soma, and ours Va _k_ , wherewith\nyou bought (Soma) from us.'

'with Soma that has not come' (to him as a\nguest), so that the guest-offering (atithya, [III, 4, 1](sbe2615.htm#3:4:1))\ncould not take place.\n\n[54:2](sbe2610.htm#fr_141) Because of this piece of gold, the offering here\ndescribed is called Hira _n_ yavati-ahuti, or 'offering with gold.'\n\n[54:3](sbe2610.htm#fr_142) See II, 1, 1, 5; 3, 1, 15.\n\n[54:4](sbe2610.htm#fr_143) The author seems to take _g_ u _h_ here as nom. of\n_g_ ur = gur (g _ri_ , gir), cf. _g_ ur _n_ i. Some of the native dictionaries\ngive _g_ u as one of the names of Sarasvati. The St. Petersb. Dict. takes it\nhere in the sense of 'drangend, treibend (pressing forward).'\n\n[55:1](sbe2610.htm#fr_144) Mano hida _m_ purastad va _k_ a _s_ _k_ arati, Ka\n_n_ va text.\n\n[55:2](sbe2610.htm#fr_145) To whom we send you, K.\n\n[55:3](sbe2610.htm#fr_146) The concluding ceremonies of the Praya _n_ iya (see\n[III, 2, 3, 23](sbe2609.htm#3:2:3:23)) are now performed; the offering of the\nBarhis being optional, as the barhis may be used again for the Udayaniya (ib.\n22).

VII, 6, 1 2 only the above\nformula is mentioned.\n\n[56:2](sbe2610.htm#fr_148) The eastern door is for the Adhvaryu (and\nSacrificer) and the southern for the Pratiprasthat _ri_.\n\n[56:3](sbe2610.htm#fr_149) Soma-kraya _n_ i, 'the cow for which the Soma-is\nbought.'\n\n[56:4](sbe2610.htm#fr_150) Prahita _m_ seems to be taken here in the double\nsense of 'put forward or in front' (from pra-dha) and despatched (from pra-\nhi).\n\n[56:5](sbe2610.htm#fr_151) 'In accordance with the thought of the mind,'\nmanaso vai _k_ ittam anu vag vadati, K.\n\n[56:6](sbe2610.htm#fr_152) The omission of 'asi' in the Brahma _n_ a is\ncurious; the Ka _n_ va text has correctly 'dakshi _n_ asi.'\n\n[56:7](sbe2610.htm#fr_153) Dhiya-dhiya, or rather 'by means of this their\nrespective genius (in regard to speech).' Dhi seems to mean 'thought expressed\nby speech,' hence often 'prayer, hymn;' cf.

It seems to refer to story-tellers (? amusing speech).\n\n[57:1](sbe2610.htm#fr_155) In Taitt. S. VI, 1, 7, 5, this epithet is explained\nby the fact that both the praya _n_ iya and the udayaniya belong to Aditi.\n\n[57:2](sbe2610.htm#fr_156) 'And her he thereby makes the guardian on his\npath,' imam evasma etad adhvani goptara _m_ karoti, K.\n\n[58:1](sbe2610.htm#fr_157) Rudra rules over these (cows); the cattle do not\npass beyond (natiyanti) him; and thus she does not pass beyond him: therefore\nhe says, 'May Rudra turn thee back!'
