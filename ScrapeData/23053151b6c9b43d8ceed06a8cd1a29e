Handing over to him (i.e. to the student) a staff, which should be made\nof (the wood of) a tree, he directs him (to observe the duties connected with\nhis vow, in the following words):\n\n15\\. \'Obey thy teacher, except in sinful conduct.\n\n16\\. \'Avoid anger and falsehood,\n\n17\\. \'Sexual intercourse,\n\n18\\. \'Sleeping on high (bedsteads),\n\n19\\. \'Performances of singing, dancing, &c., the use of perfumes and of\ncollyrium,\n\np. 71\n\n20\\. \'Bathing,\n\n21\\. \'Combing the head, cleansing the teeth, washing the feet,\n\n22\\. \'Shaving,\n\n23\\. \'Eating honey and flesh,\n\n24\\. \'Mounting a chariot yoked with cattle,\n\n25\\. \'Wearing shoes in the village,\n\n26\\. \'Svayam-indriya-mo _k_ anam.\'\n\n27\\.

After the description of the regular\nUpanayana here follow, in chaps. 1 and 2, statements regarding the special\nVratas which the Vedic student has to undergo, or rather which he may undergo,\nin the time of his studentship. Comp. the corresponding statements on the\nVratas of the _Ri_ gvedins, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya II, 11 and 12. By the\nfollowers of the Sama-veda the ceremony of the Godana, or cutting of the beard\n(comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 28, 19; Paraskara II, 1, 7 seq.; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I,\n18), was put into connection with their system of Vratas; the undergoing of\nthe Godanavrata enabled the student to study the Purvar _k_ ika of the Sama-\nveda. In the commentary on Gobhila III, 1, 28 we find the following statements\nwith regard to this Vrata as well as to the other Vratas mentioned in Sutra\n28: \'The Upanayana-vrata has been declared to refer to the study of the\nSavitri (comp. Bloomfield\'s notes on G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha II, 42. 43); the\nGodana-vrata, to the study of the collections of verses sacred to the gods\nAgni, Indra, and Soma Pavamana (this is the Purvar _k_ ika of the Sama-veda);\nthe Vratika-vrata, to the study of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, with the exclusion of the\n_S_ ukriya sections; the \xc3\x82ditya-vrata, to the study of the _S_ ukriya\nsections; the Aupanishada-vrata, to the study of the Upanishad-Brahma _n_ a;\nthe _G_ yaish _th_ asamika-vrata, to the study of the \xc3\x82 _g_ yadohas.\' The\nVratas were connected with a repetition of the Upanayana ceremony (Sutras 10\nseq.) in the way stated in my note on _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 12, 1.\xc2\x97Khadira-G _ri_\nhya II, 5, 1 seq.\n\n[69:2](sbe30023.htm#fr_260) Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 28, 19, \'The Godanakarman\nis identical with the _K_ u _d_ akarman.\' Paraskara II, 1, 7, At the Ke _s_\nanta ceremony he says, "Hair and beard" (instead of "hair," as at the _K_ u\n_d_ akara _n_ a).\'\n\n[70:3](sbe30023.htm#fr_261) At the _K_ u _d_ akara _n_ a the child sits in the\nmother\'s lap and others perform the rites for him.\n\n[70:10](sbe30023.htm#fr_262) See the note on Sutra 1.\n\n[70:11](sbe30023.htm#fr_263) Comp. above, II, 10, 7.\n\n[71:28](sbe30023.htm#fr_264) The meaning of these expressions has been\nexplained in the note on Sutra 1.\n\n[71:30](sbe30023.htm#fr_265) According to the commentary some study the _S_\nukriyas as a part of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka; these do not undergo the \xc3\x82ditya-vrata.\nOthers, for instance the Kauthumas, separate the _S_ ukriyas from the \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka and keep a special vow, the \xc3\x82ditya-vrata, by which they are enabled to\nstudy those texts.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2](sbe30024.htm)\n\n'
