What harm is there if you have no time\nor thought for us.\n\nWe, indeed, have leisure enough in old age to count the days that are past, to\ncherish in our hearts what our hands have lost for ever.\n\nThe river runs swift with a song, breaking through all barriers. But the\nmountain stays and remembers, and follows her with his love.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: My Song](cm40.htm)\n\n'
