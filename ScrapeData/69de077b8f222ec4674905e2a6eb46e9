Suta said :-- Mahar _s_ is! When the king Janaka heard of the arrival of\nS\xc2\x92uka Deva, the son of his Guru, he took his priest before him and attended by\nhis ministers came before him in pure spirit. Then he duly worshipped S\xc2\x92uka,\noffering him Padya, Arghya and an excellent seat, and a cow, yielding milk and\nthen enquired about his welfare. S\xc2\x92uka Deva accepted duly all the things\noffered by the king; and informed him of his well-being and asked the king in\nreturn, of his welfare and took his seat at ease on the \xc3\x82sana. The king Janaka\nasked the son of Vyasa, full of peace :-- \xc2\x93O Mahabhaga Muni Sattama! You are\ndevoid of any attachment and you have no desires. May I enquire why such a\nperson as your honoured self has come to me.\xc2\x94 S\xc2\x92uka Deva said :-- O great\nking! my father told me thus :-- O child; take a wife; for the house-holder's\nlife is the best of all the as'ramas but I thought that will be the source of\nmy bondage to this world and therefore did not obey his word, though he was my\nhighest Guru. He then again said to me :-- If one takes a household life, it\ndoes not at once follow that he will be held in bondage; yet I did not agree\nto that. Then the Muni, thinking me still to be in some doubt, spoke this word\nof advice to me :-- \xc2\x93O Son! Do not be sorry; go to Mi _t_ hila and have your\ndoubts solved. There my disciple\n\n\n\np. 65\n\n\n\nthe king Janaka, is governing his kingdom without any source of danger. He is\nJivanamukta (liberated while living) and is free from the ideas of body, etc.,\nso everybody knows. When that royal sage, Janaka, though governing his\nkingdom, is not seen tied up by Maya, then O Son! why are you afraid of this\nSamsara, when you are living this forest life.\n\n\n\nTherefore, O Mahabhaga! Trust me and marry; and in case you doubt very much,\nthen go and see the king Janaka; ask him and remove your doubts. He will\ncertainly solve your doubts. But, O Son! After hearing him, come again quickly\nto me.\xc2\x94 O king! When my father spoke thus, by his permission I have come now\nto your capital. O king! I don't want any thing, save Mok _s_ a (liberation);\ntherefore O Sinless one! Kindly advise what am I to do, so that I attain Mok\n_s_ a. O Lord of kings! Practising asceticism, going to the holy places of\npilgrimage, holding vratas (vows), performing sacrifices, studying the Vedas,\nor earning wisdom, whatever is the cause of Mok _s_ a, kindly say that.\nHearing this, Janaka said :-- \xc2\x93O son of my Guru! I am telling what ought to be\ndone by the Brahma _n_ as, following the path of Mok _s_ a; listen. After\nhaving the holy thread, a Brahmin should live in the house of his Guru to\nstudy the Vedas, the Vedantas and pay the Dakshi _n_ a (the fee) to the Guru\naccording to rules; he will then return home and marry and enter into the\nhouseholder's life; he should lead a life of contentment, be free from\ndesires, sinless and truthful and earn his livelihood with a pure heart and\naccording to the sanction of justice and conscience. He is to perform the\nAgnihotra and other sacrifices; and after getting sons and grandsons, he is to\nleave his wife under the care of his son and then to take the life of a\nVanaprastha (3rd stage of life). That Brahman, the knower of Dharma, must\npractise tapasya and become master of his six passions (enemies); and when he\ngets disgusted with the world and when the Vairagyam (dispassion) will arise\nwithin him, he would enter into the fourth \xc3\x82s'rama. For, the man is first to\nenter into the householder's life and when he will be quite dispassionate\ntowards the world, he will then have a right to take the \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama of Sannyasa\n(Renunciation). A course contrary to this can never entitle one to the \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama\nof Sanyasa.\n\n\n\nThis is the beneficial word of the Vedas and it must hold true; it cannot be\nfalse; this is my firm belief. O S\xc2\x92uka! In the Vedas are mentioned forty-eight\nSamskaras (consecrations; purificatory rites); out of which the learned\nMahatmas have reserved forty Samskaras for the householders and the last eight\nSamskaras (S'ama, Dama, etc.,) for the Sannyasins. And this good usage is\nheard to come down from very ancient times. A Brahma _n_ a ought to complete\nhis previous \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92ramas successively and then enter into the succeeding \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama.\n\n\n\np. 66\n\n\n\n23-30. S\xc2\x92uka said :-- If the pure Vairagyam (dispassion) arising out of\nknowledge and wisdom (j\xc3\xb1an and Vij\xc3\xb1an) already arises (before taking to the\ngrihasth \xc3\x82s'ram), is it still necessary to pass through house holder\xc2\x92s life,\nVanaprastha life, etc., or is one entitled then to take up at once the\nSannyasa \xc3\x82s'rama, quit everything and reside in the forest? Janaka said :-- O!\nOne giving honour to the S\xc2\x92astras and Gurus! Though the powerful passions seem\nto be under control in the period of unripened Yoga (the imperfect yogic\nstate), yet one ought not to trust them; for, it is generally seen, many\nimperfect Yogins find themselves disturbed by one or other of the senses. If\nthe mind of one who has already entered into the Sannyasa \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92ram gets\nperturbed in his course, then, how can he, you can see this for yourself,\nsatisfy desires of eating good things, sleeping nicely, seeing his son, or\nwishing any other desires, knowing them to lead to his degradation? He is then\nin a very serious state. The net of desires is very difficult to be conquered\nby men; that can never die out. Therefore, to put an end to them, the advise\nis to cut them slowly and slowly. He who sleeps on an elevated place has the\ndanger of tumbling down; but one who sleeps in a low place has no such danger.\nSo any man who has once taken the highest dharma Sannyasa, and if he be\nfallen, then he never gets hold of the real track. As an ant begins to get\nfrom the root of tree, and, by and by, gets to the topmost part of the\nbranches, so human beings go by degrees from one \xc3\x82s'rama to another till they\ngo to the highest; then and then only they are able to get easily their\ndesired truth. The birds without anticipating any danger, get up to the skies\nvery quickly and soon they get tired and cannot go to their desired place but\nthe ant goes with rest to its desired place. This mind is very difficult to be\ncontrolled; for this reason the men of unripened minds, cannot conquer it all\nat once; and are advised to conquer it, by and by, observing the laws of one\n\xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama after another.\n\n\n\n31-37. See also if anybody, remaining in his household life be of a quiet\ntemper and of good intellect, and if he takes success and failure in the same\nlight, and be not elated in times of pleasure and not depressed in times of\npains and does his duty for duty\xc2\x92s sake without troubling his mind with cares,\nand anxieties, then that householder acquires pure happiness by the\nrealisation of his self and acquires Mok _s_ ha. There is no manner of doubt\nin this. O Sinless One! See, I am liberated while living, though I am engaged\nin preserving kingdom; if any source of pain or pleasure arises, I am not in\nany way affected by them. As I will attain in the end Videha Mukti (liberation\nfrom bodies) though I am always wandering at my free will, enjoying various\nthings as I like\n\n\n\np. 67\n\n\n\nand do various things as it pleases me, so you can do your duties and then be\nliberated in the end.\n\n\n\nO Son of my Guru! When this material world, the cause of all error according\nto the Vedanta S\xc2\x92astras, is simply an object of sight then how can this\nmaterial substance, an object of sight, be the source of bondage to the \xc3\x82tman,\nthe Self? O Brahman! Though the five material elements can be seen, their\nqualities or Gu _n_ as can be known only by inference, so the self is to be\ninferred; it can never be an object of sight; and also this self, known by\ninference, changeless and without any impurity or stain can never be bound by\nthe visible changeful material thing. O Brahman! This impure heart is the\nsource of all pleasure and pains; so when the heart becomes pure and quiet,\nall the things then become fully pure, O Brahma _n_ a!\n\n\n\n38-41. If going often and often to all Tiraths and bathing there, do not make\none's heart pure and holy, then all one's troubles are taken in vain. O\nDestroyer of enemies! It is the mind that is the cause of bondage or freedom;\nand not the body, nor the Jivatma (the embodied soul), nor the senses. The\nSelf or \xc3\x82tman is always pure consciousness and is ever free so, truly\nspeaking, it can never be bound. Bondage and freedom reside on in the mind; so\nwhen the Mind gets peace, the bondage of Samsara is also at an end. He is an\nenemy, he is a friend, he is neither an enemy nor friend, all these different\nthoughts reside in the mind and arise out of duality; how can the ideas of\ndifferences exist, when everything has become all one pervading self?\n\n\n\n42-47. Jiva is Brahma; I am that Brahma and nothing else; there is nothing to\nbe discussed here. It is owing to the dualities that monism appears not clear\nand differences between Jiva and Brahma arise. O Mahabhaga! This difference is\ndue to Avidya and by which this difference vanishes, that is termed Vidya.\n\n\n\nThis difference between Vidya and Avidya ought to be always kept in view, by\nthose that are clever.\n\n\n\nHow can the pleasure from the cooling effect of the shadow, be felt, if the\nheating effect of the rays of the Sun be not previously experienced? So how\nVidya is to be experienced if Avidya be not felt before? Sattva, Rajas and\nTamo Gu _n_ as reside naturally in things, made of Gu _n_ as; and the five\nprincipal elements reside naturally in substances made up of elements; so the\nsenses reside naturally in their own forms, etc.; so how can there be any\nstain to the \xc3\x82tman which is unattached? Yet to teach humanity, the high souled\npersons preserve always with greatest care the respect of the Vedas. If they\ndo not do this, then, O Sinless One! the ignorant persons would act lawlessly\naccording to their wishes, like\n\n\n\np. 68\n\n\n\nthe Charvakas; and Dharma will become extinct. When Dharma will become\nextinct, the Var _n_ as\xc2\x92rama will gradually die out; so the well-wishers\nshould always follow the path of the Vedas.\n\n\n\n48-56. S\xc2\x92uka said :-- \xc2\x93O King! I have now heard all that you have said; still\nmy doubt remains; it is not solved. O King! In the Dharma of the Vedas, there\nis Himsa (act of killing and injuring); and we hear that there is much of\nAdharma (sin) in the above Himsa.\n\n\n\nSo how can the Dharma of the Vedas give Mok _s_ ha? O King! One can see before\none's eyes that the drinking of Soma rasa, the killing of animals, the eating\nof fish and flesh and so are advised in the Vedas; so much so that in the\nsacrificial ceremony named Sautrama _n_ a the rule of drinking wine and many\nother vratas are clearly mentioned; even gambling is advised in the Vedas. So\nhow can Mukti be obtained by following the Veda Dharma? It is heard that, in\nancient times, there was a great king, named S'as'avindu, very religious,\ntruthful, and performing sacrifices, very liberal; he protected the virtuous,\nand chastised those that were wicked and going astray. He performed many\nYaj\xc3\xb1as, where many cows and sheep were sacrificed according to the rules of\nthe Vedas and abundant Dakshi _n_ as (sacrificial fees) were presented to\nevery one that performed their parts in the sacrifices. In these sacrifices,\nthe hides of the cows that were sacrificed as victims, were heaped to such an\nenormous extent that they looked liked a second Bindhyachal mountain. Then the\nrains fell and the dirty water coming out of that enormous heap of skins\nflowed down and gave rise to a river which was thence called the Charma _n_\nvati river. And what a wonder? That cruel king left behind him an ineffaceable\nfame and went to Heavens. Whatever it may be, it can never come to my head\nthat I should perform the Veda Dharma, filled with so many acts of killing and\ncruelties. Again, when the man find pleasure in sexual intercourses and when\nthey do not have that intercourse, they experience pain, how can you expect\nsuch persons to attain liberation.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n57-61. Janaka said :-- \xc2\x93The killing of animals in a sacrificial ceremony is\nnot killing; it is known as Ahimsa; for that himsa is not from any selfish\nattachment; therefore when there is no such sacrifice and the animals are\nkilled out of selfish attachment, then that is real himsa; there is no other\nopinion in this. Smoke arises from a fire when fuels are placed in it; and\nsmoke is not seen when no fuel is added. So, O Munisattama! The himsa, as\nprescribed in the Vedas, is free from all blemishes, selfish attachment, etc.,\nand therefore it is unblameable. So it follows the himsa committed by persons\nattached to objects, is the real himsa; that can be blamed, but the himsa of\nthose persons who\n\n\n\np. 69\n\n\n\nhave no desires is not that sort of himsa. Therefore the learned men that know\nthe Vedas declare that the himsa done by the dispassionate persons, with their\nhearts free from egoism, is no himsa done at all. O Dvija! Really speaking,\nthe killing of animals done by the house-holder attached to senses and their\nobjects, and done under their impulses can be taken into account as a real act\nof killing; but, O Mahabhaga of those whose hearts are not attached to\nanything of those self controlled persons, desirous of mok _s_ a, if they do\nan act of Himsa out of a sense of duty, with no desires of fruits and with\ntheir hearts free from egoism that can never be reckoned as a real act of\nkilling.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus ends the 18th Chapter of the 1st Skandha on Janaka's giving instructions\non truth to S\xc2\x92uka Deva in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 19](bk01ch19.htm)\n\n"
