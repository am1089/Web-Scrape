The wives of Gurus (superiors), who are of a lower class than their\nhusbands (such as Kshatriya or Vai _s_ ya or Murdhavasikta wives), shall be\nhonoured by (rising to meet and) saluting them from far; but he must not\nembrace their feet.\n\n6\\. He should avoid to rub and anoint the limbs of Guru's wives, or to anoint\ntheir eyes, or to arrange their hair, or to wash their feet, or to do other\nsuch services for them.\n\n7\\. To the wife of another, even though he does not know her, he must either\nsay 'sister' (if she is of equal age with himself), or 'daughter' (if she is\nyounger than himself), or 'mother' (if she is older than himself).\n\n8\\. Let him not say 'thou[1]' to his Gurus (superiors).\n\n9\\. If he has offended one of them (by saying 'thou' to him, or in some other\nmanner), he must keep a fast and not eat again till the end of the day, after\nhaving obtained his forgiveness.\n\n10\\. He must avoid to quarrel with his spiritual teacher and to argue with him\n(from emulation).\n\n11\\. And he must not censure him;\n\n[5. _S_ udra wives are exempt from this rule; he should rise to meet, but not\nsalute them. (Nand.)\n\n8\\. 1 Other insulting language, as e. g. if he says hush or pish to them, is\nalso included in this term. The use of the particle _k_ a indicates that other\npersons entitled to respect are also intended in this Sutra. (Nand.)\n\n10\\. 'The particle _k_ a is used in order to include Brahma _n_ as in general\nin this prohibition.' (Nand.)\n\n11\\. 'The use of the particle _k_ a shows that defamatory speeches are also\nintended.' (Nand.)]\n\np. 131\n\n12\\. Nor act so as to displease him.\n\n13\\. (A pupil) must not embrace the feet of a Guru's young wife, if he has\ncompleted his twentieth year, or can distinguish virtue from vice.\n\n14\\. But a young student may at pleasure prostrate himself before a young wife\nof his Guru, (stretching out both hands) as ordained (see XXVIII, 15), 'I, N.\nN. (ho! salute thee).'\n\n15\\. On returning from a journey he shall (once) embrace the feet of the wives\nof his Gurus (superiors), and daily, salute them, remembering the practice of\nthe virtuous.\n\n16\\. Wealth, kindred, age, the performance of religious observances, and,\nfifthly, sacred knowledge are titles to respect; each subsequent one is\nsuperior to the one preceding in order.\n\n17\\. A Brahma _n_ a, though only ten years old[1], and a member of the kingly\ncaste, though a hundred years old, must be considered as father and son; and\nof these two, the Brahma _n_ a is the father.\n\n18\\. The seniority of Brahma _n_ as is founded upon sacred knowledge; of\nKshatriyas, upon valour in arms; of Vaisyas, upon grain and (other) wealth; of\n_S_ udras, upon (priority of) birth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXXIII.](sbe07035.htm)\n\n"
