The sacrifice being now complete, he (the Adhvaryu) walks round\n(the fire) to the south, and pours out a vessel (of water); for thus it is\n(poured out) towards north: therefore he pours it out after walking round to\nthe south, He who sacrifices, doubtless, sacrifices with a desire that he also\nmay obtain a place in the world of the gods. That sacrifice of his then goes\nforth towards the world of the gods: after it follows the fee which he gives\n(to the priests), and holding on to the priests\' fee (follows) the sacrificer.\n\np. 267\n\n1:9:3:22\\. That same path leads either to the gods or to the fathers 1. On\nboth sides two flames are ever burning: they scorch him who deserves to be\nscorched, and allow him to pass who deserves to pass 2. Now, water is (a means\nof) lustration: hence he thereby lustrates that path.\n\n1:9:3:33\\. A full (vessel) he pours out, because full means all: hence he\nthereby lustrates that (path) by means of the All. He pours it out\ncontinuously, uninterruptedly: hence he thereby lustrates that (path) in a\ncontinuous, uninterrupted manner.\n\n1:9:3:44\\. And again why he pours out a vessel (of water) is: where anything\nis done wrongly at the sacrifice, there they tear or wound it; and--water\nbeing (a means of) lustration--he lustrates it by that (means of) lustration,\nwater; he heals it with water.\n\n1:9:3:55\\. A full (vessel) he pours out, because full means all: hence he\nthereby heals it by means of the All. Continuously, uninterruptedly he pours\nit out: hence he thereby heals it in a continuous (lasting), uninterrupted\nmanner.\n\n1:9:3:66\\. He (the sacrificer) intercepts it with his open hands held\ntogether, while reciting the text (Va _g_. S. II, 24),\n\np. 268\n\n[paragraph continues] \'We have united with lustre, with vigour, with the\nbodies 1, with the happy spirit. May Tvash _t_ _ri_ , the dispenser of boons,\ngrant us riches, and make even what was injured in our body!\' What was torn,\nthat he thereby heals.\n\n1:9:3:77\\. He then touches his face (with the water in his hands). The reason\nwhy he thus touches his face is twofold: water means ambrosia, and with\nambrosia he accordingly touches himself; also he thereby transfers to himself\nthat sacred work (the sacrifice): for these reasons he touches his face.\n\n1:9:3:88\\. He now strides the (three) Vish _n_ u-strides. He who sacrifices\nassuredly gratifies the gods. In gratifying the gods by that sacrifice--partly\nby ri _k_ s, partly by ya _g_ us, partly by oblations--he acquires a share\namong them; and having acquired a share among them, he goes to them.\n\n1:9:3:99\\. And again why he strides the Vish _n_ u-strides, is; Vish _n_ u,\ntruly, is the sacrifice, by striding (vi-kram) he obtained for the gods that\nall-pervading power (vikranti) which now belongs to them. By his first step he\ngained this same (earth), by the second this aerial expanse, and by his last\n(step) the sky. And this same pervading power Vish _n_ u, as the sacrifice,\nobtains by his strides for him (the sacrificer): for this reason he strides\n\np. 269\n\nthe Vish _n_ u-strides. Now it is indeed from this (earth) that most (beings)\ngo (upwards).\n\n1:9:3:1010\\. Hence (he strides thrice) with the texts (Va _g_. S. II, 25 a-c),\n\'On the earth Vish _n_ u strode by means of the gayatri metre: excluded\ntherefrom is he who hates us, and whom we hate!\' \'In the air Vish _n_ u strode\nby means of the trish _t_ ubh metre: excluded therefrom is he who hates us,\nand whom we hate!\' \'In the sky Vish _n_ u strode by means of the _g_ agati\nmetre: excluded therefrom is he who hates us, and whom we hate!\' When one has\nthus ascended these worlds, that is the goal, that the safe refuge: the rays\nof him (the sun) who burns there, are the righteous (departed) 1; and what\nhighest light there is 2, that is Pra _g_ apati or the heavenly world. Having\nthen in this way ascended these worlds, he reaches that goal, that safe\nrefuge. Now he who wishes to give instructions from hence, should come\nhitherwards from above. Twofold is the reason why he should come hitherwards\nfrom above:\n\n1:9:3:1111\\. By (or, from) the escape (of the enemies) 3 indeed the conquering\ngods formerly gained first the sky, and then this aerial expanse; and\nthereupon\n\np. 270\n\nthey drove their enemies away from this (earth), whence there was no escape.\nAnd in like manner he (the priest) also by the escape (of the enemies) gains\nfirst the sky, and then this aerial expanse; and thereupon he drives his\nenemies away from this (earth), whence there is no escape. This earth indeed\nis a firm footing: hence he thereby stands firm on this firm footing.\n\n1:9:3:1212\\. And in this way also (he may stride) 1: \'In the sky Vish _n_ u\nstrode by means of the _g_ agati metre: excluded therefrom is he who hates us,\nand whom we hate!\' \'In the air Vish _n_ u strode by means of the trish _t_ ubh\nmetre: excluded therefrom is he who hates us, and whom we hate!\' \'On the earth\nVish _n_ u strode by means of _th_ e gayatri metre: excluded therefrom is he\nwho hates us, and whom we hate!\'--With the texts (Va _g_. S. II, 25 d, e),\n\'(Excluded) from this food! from this resort!\' (pratish _th_ a, he looks down\nupon his portion and the altar respectively.) For on this (earth) all this\nfood is safely established (pratish _th_ ita): for this reason he says, \'From\nthis food! from this resort!\'\n\n1:9:3:1313\\. He then looks towards the east. The east, indeed, is the region\nof the gods: for this reason he looks towards the east.\n\n1:9:3:1414\\. He looks, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 25 f), \'We have gone to\nthe realm of light (svar).\' The\n\np. 271\n\nrealm of light assuredly means the gods: hence he thereby says, \'We have gone\nto the gods.\'--With (ib. g), \'We have united with splendour\' (he looks on the\n\xc3\x82havaniya fire): he thereby says, \'We have united with the gods.\'\n\n1:9:3:1515\\. He then looks up to the sun, for that is the final goal, that the\nsafe resort. To that final goal, to that resort he thereby goes: for this\nreason he looks up to the sun.\n\n1:9:3:1616\\. He looks up, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 26 a), \'Self-existent\nart thou, the best ray of light!\' The sun is indeed the best ray of light 1,\nand therefore he says, \'Self-existent art thou, the best ray of light.\'\n\'"Light-bestowing art thou: give me light (var _k_ as)!" so say I,\' said Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, \'for at this indeed the Brahma _n_ a should strive, that he\nbe brahmavar _k_ asin (illumed by the brahma, or sacred writ).\' Aupoditeya 2,\non the other hand, said, \'He indeed will give me cows 3: (therefore I say),\n"Cow-giving art thou, give me cows!"\' Thus whatever wish he (the sacrificer)\nentertains (and expresses), that wish is granted to him.\n\n1:9:3:1717\\. He then turns (from left to right), with the text (Va _g_. S. II,\n26 b), \'I move along the course of\n\np. 272\n\nthe sun;\' having reached that final goal, that safe resort, he now moves along\nthe course of that (sun) 1.\n\n1:9:3:1818\\. Thereupon he steps to (upa-stha) the Garhapatya fire. Twofold is\nthe reason why he steps to the Garhapatya: the Garhapatya is a house, and a\nhouse is a safe resort, hence he thereby stays in a house, that is, in a safe\nresort. And, besides, what full measure of human life there is for him here,\nthat he thereby attains (upa-stha). This is why he steps to the Garhapatya\nfire.\n\n1:9:3:1919\\. He steps to it, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 27 a), \'O\nhouseholder Agni, may I become a good householder through thee, O Agni, the\nhouseholder! Mayest thou, O Agni, become a good householder through me, the\nhouseholder!\' there is nothing in this requiring explanation.--\'May our\nhousehold matters be unlike a cart with only one bullock,\' he thereby says,\n\'may our household matters be free from calamities;\'--\'for a hundred winters!\'\nhe thereby says, \'may I live a hundred years.\' He need not, however, say this;\nfor man lives even longer than a hundred years: hence he need not say this.\n\n1:9:3:2020\\. He then turns (from left to right), with the text (Va _g_. S. II,\n27 b), \'I move along the course of the sun:\' having reached that final goal,\nthat safe resort, he now moves along the course of that (sun).\n\n1:9:3:2121\\. Now (in pronouncing the following text) he\n\np. 273\n\ninserts his son\'s name: \'May this son (N.N.) carry on this manly deed of mine\n1!\' Should he have no son, let him insert his own name.\n\n1:9:3:2222\\. He then steps up to the \xc3\x82havaniya fire. Silently he steps to it,\nthinking, \'In the east my sacrifice shall be completed!\'\n\n1:9:3:2323\\. Thereupon he divests himself of the vow, with the text (Va _g_.\nS. II, 28 b), \'Now am I he that I really am.\' For, in entering upon the vow,\nhe becomes, as it were, non-human; and as it would not be becoming for him to\nsay, \'I enter from truth into untruth;\' and as, in fact, he now again becomes\nman, let him therefore divest himself of the vow, with the text, \'Now am I he\nthat I really am 2.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[267:1](sbe1239.htm#fr_625) Cf. Mahabh. XII, 525, \'Two paths are known, one\nleading to the gods, and one leading to the fathers; and ib. XIII, 1082, That\nsun is said to be the gate of the paths leading to the gods; and that moon is\nsaid to be the gate of the paths leading to the fathers.\' See also _Kh_ and.\nUp. V, 3. In _S_ at. Br. VI, 6, 2, 4 the gate of the heavenly world is said to\nbe situated in the northeast; whilst that of the world of the fathers,\naccording to XIII, 8, 1, 5, lies in the south-east. Cf. Kaushit. Up. I, 2 seq.\n(Max Muller, Up. I, p. 274), \'Verily, the moon is the door of the heavenly\nworld,\' &c.\n\n[267:2](sbe1239.htm#fr_626) According to Harisvamin, they scorch him who has\nnot fulfilled his duties, and allow him to pass who has done so.\n\n[268:1](sbe1239.htm#fr_627) That is, with the departed persons, the fathers;\nor, more probably, with new bodies (?), cf. the funereal hymns, Rig-veda X,\n14-18; especially X, 35, 14; 16, 5; 14, 8. Perhaps, however, it would be\nbetter to construe, \'by (our) bodies we have united with lustre and vigour; by\n(our) mind with bliss.\' In IV, 6, 1, 1 it is said, that the sacrificer is born\nin the next world with his entire body; similarly XI, 1, 8, 6; XII, 8, 3, 31.\nFor further quotations regarding the views on future existence, see A. Weber,\nInd. Streifen, I, p. 20 seq.; J. Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, V, p. 314 seq.\n\n[269:1](sbe1239.htm#fr_628) In VI, 5, 4, 8 we shall meet with the statement,\nthat \'the stars (nakshatra) are the lights of righteous men who go to the\nheavenly world.\' In the same passage, however (as in others), the nakshatras\n(lunar mansions) are represented as divine female beings (with unclipped\nwings; cf. Va _g_. S. XI, 61), with whom, in IX, 4, 1, 9, the moon is said to\nlive together, as the Gandharvas with the Apsaras.\n\n[269:2](sbe1239.htm#fr_629) See par. 16 with note. The Ka _n_ va text reads,\n\'yat param bhati.\'\n\n[269:3](sbe1239.htm#fr_630) Apasara _n_ ata _h_ ; i.e. by allowing the enemies\nto escape, viz.; first from the sky to the air, and then from the air to the\nearth. It also, however, has the meaning of \'from escape;\' that is, the gods\ndrove the enemies to the earth, whence there was no escape for them.\n\n[270:1](sbe1239.htm#fr_631) The sacrificer in making the strides of Vish _n_\nu, may begin either with the stride on earth or with that in the sky (Katy.\nIII, 8, 11, 12). He begins from the southern hip (or south-west corner) of the\naltar, and makes three strides eastward with his right foot in front, reciting\none formula with each stride, along the south side of the altar up to the\n\xc3\x82havaniya fire.\n\n[271:1](sbe1239.htm#fr_632) Seven rays of the sun are mentioned, Rig-veda I,\n105, 9; II, 5, 2; [Ath](errata.htm#7)-veda VII, 107, 1. Mahidhara remarks that\nfour of them lie in, or point to, the four quarters; one pointing upwards and\nanother downwards; and the seventh, and best, being the disc of the sun\nitself, called Hira _n_ yagarbha. This apparently is the param bhas, or most\nexcellent light, which in par. 10 is identified with Pra _g_ apati, or the\nheavenly world.\n\n[271:2](sbe1239.htm#fr_633) That is, Tumi _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a Aupoditeya Vaiyaghrapadya,\nas the Ka _n_ va text reads; cf. Taitt. S. I, 7, 2, 1.\n\n[271:3](sbe1239.htm#fr_634) The heavenly rays of light are regarded as the\nheavenly cows,. Naigh. I, 5; Nir. II, 6.\n\n[272:1](sbe1239.htm#fr_635) When he has executed the pradakshi _n_ a movement,\nhe has to repeat the movement in the opposite direction, in accordance with\nthe general rule, Katy. I, 8, 24. The same applies to par. 20. On the sun-wise\ncircumambulation, with and without fire, see [p. 37](sbe1207.htm#page_37)\nnote, [p. 45](sbe1208.htm#page_45) note; also Martin, Western Isles, pp.\n16-20, 85, 97, 116-119, 241, 277; Forbes Leslie, Early Races of Scotland,\nindex, s.v. deisiol.\n\n[273:1](sbe1239.htm#fr_636) The Madhyandina text of the Va _g_. S. does not\ngive this formula. The Ka _n_ va text of the Sa _m_ hita has the following\n(Weber\'s edition, p. 59), \'Woven art thou, a web art thou: weave me along (?\nextend my life) at this sacrifice, at this holy deed, in this food, in this\nworld!\' \'May my son weave on (continue) this work, this manly deed of mine!\'\nThus also Katy. III, 8, 25. The Ka _n_ va text of the Brahma _n_ a, however,\nmentions only the formula given above. According to Laugakshi he names his\nfavourite son; according to _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, his eldest son, or as many sons as\nhe has. See comm. on Katy. IV, 12, II.\n\n[273:2](sbe1239.htm#fr_637) See I, 1, 1, 6. For another mode of divesting\noneself of the vow, see I, 1, 1, 3.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 1. First Adhyaya.
