Or (the souls' being the food of the gods is) metaphorical, on account of\ntheir not knowing the Self. For thus (scripture) declares.\n\nThe word 'or' is meant to set aside the started objection. The souls' being\nfood has to be understood in a metaphorical, not a literal, sense, as\notherwise all scriptural statements of claims (adhikara)--such as 'He who is\ndesirous of the heavenly world is to sacrifice'--would be contradicted. If\n\np. 111\n\nthe performers of sacrifices, &c., did not, in the sphere of the moon, enjoy\nthe fruits of their works, why should they undertake works such as sacrifices,\nwhich are to him who performs them the cause of great trouble? We see,\nmoreover, that the word 'food,' as denoting in general whatever is the cause\nof enjoyment, is metaphorically used of that also which is not food (in the\nnarrower sense), as, for instance, in such phrases as 'the Vai _s_ yas are the\nfood of kings, the animals are the food of the Vai _s_ yas.' Hence what is\nmeant there by the term 'eating' is the rejoicing of the gods with the\nperformers of sacrifices, &c., who stand in a subordinate (instrumental)\nrelation to that rejoicing--a rejoicing analogous to that of an ordinary man\nwith beloved persons such as wife, children, friends, and so on--not actual\neating like the chewing and swallowing of sweetmeats. For that the gods eat in\nthe ordinary way a scriptural passage expressly denies ( _Kh_. Up. III, 6, 1),\n'The gods do not eat or drink; by seeing the nectar they are satisfied.' At\nthe same time the performers of sacrifices, although standing in a subordinate\nrelation to the gods. may themselves be in a state of enjoyment, like servants\nwho (although subordinate to the king) themselves live on the king.--That the\nperformers of sacrifices are objects of enjoyment for the gods follows,\nmoreover, from their quality of not knowing the Self. For that those who do\nnot know the Self are objects of enjoyment for the gods the following\nscriptural passage shows, 'Now, if a man worships another deity, thinking the\ndeity is one and he is another, he does not know. He is like a beast for the\nDevas' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10). That means: he, in this life, propitiating the\ngods by means of oblations and other works, serves them like a beast, and does\nso in the other world also, depending on them like a beast and enjoying the\nfruits of his works as assigned by them.--The latter part of the Sutra can be\nexplained in another manner also 1. Those who do not know the Self are those\nwho perform works only, such as sacrifices, &c.,\n\np. 112\n\nand do not join knowledge to works. We then take the expression, 'the\nknowledge of the Self,' as indirectly denoting the knowledge of the five\nfires; an explanation which rests on the general subject-matter. And on\naccount of the performers of sacrifices being destitute of the knowledge of\nthe five fires the circumstance of their serving as food is brought forward as\na mere gu _n_ avada 1 for the purpose of glorifying the knowledge of the five\nfires. For the latter is what the text aims at enjoining, as we infer from the\ngeneral purport of the passage.--'For thus' another scriptural passage\n'declares,' viz. that enjoyment (on the part of the _g_ iva) takes place in\nthe sphere of the moon, 'Having enjoyed greatness in the Soma world he returns\nagain' (Pr. Up. V, 4). Another scriptural passage also declares that the\nperformers of sacrifices dwelling together with the gods obtain enjoyment, 'A\nhundred blessings of the fathers who have conquered this world make one\nblessing of the work-gods, who obtain their godhead by work' (B _ri_. Up. IV,\n3. 33).--As thus the statement about the performers of sacrifices becoming\nfood is metaphorical only, we understand that it is their souls which go, and\nhence there is no longer any objection to the doctrine that they go enveloped\nby water.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[111:1](sbe38083.htm#fr_80) Anatma _s_ abda _s_ ruter mukhyarthatvanurodhena\nsutra _m_ _s_ asyartham uktva prakara _n_ anurodhenarthantaram aha. \xc3\x82n.
