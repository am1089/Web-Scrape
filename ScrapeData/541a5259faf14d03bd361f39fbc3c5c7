There is pre-eminence of the (meditation on) plenitude (i.e. Agni Vai _s_\nvanara in his aggregate form), as in the case of sacrifices; for thus\nscripture shows.\n\nIn the legend beginning 'Pra _k_ ina _s_ ala Aupamanyava,' the text speaks of\nmeditations on Vai _s_ vanara in his distributed\n\np. 275\n\nas well as his aggregate condition. References to him in his distributed state\nare made in the passage, 'Aupamanyava, whom do you meditate on as the Self? He\nreplied: Heaven only, venerable king. He said: The Self which you meditate on\nis the Vai _s_ vanara Self called Sute _g_ as;' and in the following passages\n( _Kh_. Up. V, 12-17). A meditation on him in his aggregate state, on the\nother hand, is referred to in the passage (V, 18), 'Of that Vai _s_ vanara\nSelf the head is Sute _g_ as, the eye Vi _s_ varupa, the breath P _ri_\nthagvartman, the trunk Bahula, the bladder Rayi, the feet the earth' &c.--A\ndoubt here arises whether the text intimates a meditation on Vai _s_ vanara in\nboth his forms or only in his aggregate form.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that we have to do with meditations on Vai _s_\nvanara in his distributed form, firstly because the text exhibits a special\nverb, viz. 'you meditate on,' with reference to each of the limbs, Sute _g_ as\nand so on; and secondly because the text states special fruits (connected with\neach special meditation) in the passage, 'Therefore every kind of Soma\nlibation is seen in your house,' and the later similar passages.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. We must suppose that the entire section\naims at intimating 'the pre-eminence,' i.e. at intimating as its pre-eminent\nsubject, a meditation on 'plenitude,' i.e. on Vai _s_ vanara in his aggregate\nstate, who comprises within himself a plurality of things; not a number of\nspecial meditations on the limbs of Vai _s_ vanara. 'As in the case of\nsacrifices.' In the same way as the Vedic texts referring to sacrifices such\nas the dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa aim at enjoining the performance of the entire\nsacrifice only, i.e. of the chief sacrificial action together with its members\n--and not in addition the performance of single subordinate members such as\nthe praya _g_ as, nor again the performance of the chief action together with\nsome of its subordinate members; so it is here also.--But whence do you know\nthat 'plenitude' is the preeminent topic of the passage?--It is shown by\nscripture, we reply, since we apprehend that the entire section forms a\nconnected whole. For on examining the connexion of\n\np. 276\n\nthe parts we find that the entire section has for its subject the knowledge of\nVai _s_ vanara. The text at first informs us that six Rishis--Pra _k_ ina _s_\nala, &c., up to Uddalaka--being unable to reach a firm foundation in the\nknowledge of Vai _s_ vanara, went to the king A _s_ vapati Kaikeya; goes on to\nmention the object of each _Ri_ shi's meditation, viz. the sky and so on;\ndetermines that the sky and so on are only the head and so on of Vai _s_\nvanara--in the passage 'he said: that is but the head of the Self,' and the\nlater similar passages;--and thereupon rejects all meditations on Vai _s_\nvanara in his distributed form, in the passage, 'Your head would have fallen\nif you had not come to me,' and so on. Finally having discarded all\ndistributed meditation it turns to the meditation on the aggregate Vai _s_\nvanara and declares that all results rest on him only, 'he eats food in all\nworlds, in all beings, in all Selfs.'--That the text mentions special fruits\nfor the special meditations on Sute _g_ as and so on we have, in accordance\nwith our view, to explain as meaning that the results of the subordinate\nmeditations are to be connected in their aggregate with the principal\nmeditation. And that the text exhibits a special verb--'you do meditate'--in\nconnexion with each member is not meant to enjoin special meditations on those\nmembers, but merely to make additional remarks about something which has\nanother purpose (i.e. about the meditation on the aggregate Vai _s_ vanara).--\nFor all these reasons the view according to which the text enjoins a\nmeditation on the aggregate Vai _s_ vanara only is preferable.\n\nSome commentators here establish the conclusion that the meditation on the\naggregate Vai _s_ vanara is the preferable alternative, but assume, on the\nground of the Sutra employing the term 'pre-eminence' only, that the Sutrakara\nallows also the alternative of distributed meditation. But this is\ninadmissible, since it is improper to assume a 'split of the sentence' (i.e.\nto ascribe to a passage a double meaning), as long as the passage may be\nunderstood as having one meaning only. Their interpretation, moreover,\ncontradicts those passages which expressly blame distributed meditations; such\nas 'Thy head would have\n\np. 277\n\nfallen,' And as the conclusion of the section clearly intimates a meditation\non the aggregate Vai _s_ vanara, the negation of such meditation could not be\nmaintained as purvapaksha 1. The term 'pre-eminence' which the Sutra employs\nmay moreover be explained as meaning (not mere preferability, but exclusive)\nauthoritativeness.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[274:1](sbe38199.htm#fr_171) As this passage states the number of the praya\n_g_ as (viz. five, which is the number of the seasons) and other secondary\npoints, we conclude that the injunction of the offering of the praya _g_ as,\nwhich is given in other _S_ akhas, is valid also for the _S_ akha referred to\nin the text (the Maitraya _n_ iyas, according to the commentators).\n\n[274:2](sbe38199.htm#fr_172) But only says 'they offer an animal to\nAgnishomau.'\n\n[274:3](sbe38199.htm#fr_173) Wherefrom we infer that not any animal may be\noffered to Agnishomau, but only a he-goat.\n\n[277:1](sbe38200.htm#fr_174) Yadobhayatropastisiddhantas tada vyastopastir\nevatra samastopastir eva va purvapaksha _h_ syan nadya ity aha, spash _t_ e\n_k_ eti, dvitiya _s_ _k_ a tatrayukto vakyopakramasthavyastopastidhivirodhat,\n\xc3\x82n.
