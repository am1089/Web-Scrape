If (it be objected that the term anandamaya, consisting of bliss, can)\nnot (denote the highest Self) on account of its being a word denoting a\nmodification\n\np. 67\n\n[paragraph continues] (or product); (we declare the objection to be) not\n(valid) on account of abundance, (the idea of which may be expressed by the\naffix maya.)\n\nHere the purvapakshin raises the objection that the word anandamaya\n(consisting of bliss) cannot denote the highest Self.--Why?--Because the word\nanandamaya is understood to denote something different from the original word\n(i.e. the word ananda without the derivative affix maya), viz. a modification;\naccording to the received sense of the affix maya. '\xc3\x82nandamaya' therefore\ndenotes a modification, just as annamaya (consisting of food) and similar\nwords do.\n\nThis objection is, however, not valid, because 'maya' is also used in the\nsense of abundance, i.e. denotes that where there is abundance of what the\noriginal word expresses. So, for instance, the phrase 'the sacrifice is\nannamaya' means 'the sacrifice is abounding in food' (not 'is some\nmodification or product of food'). Thus here Brahman also, as abounding in\nbliss, is called anandamaya. That Brahman does abound in bliss follows from\nthe passage (Taitt. Up. II, 8), where, after the bliss of each of the\ndifferent classes of beings, beginning with man, has been declared to be a\nhundred times greater than the bliss of the immediately preceding class, the\nbliss of Brahman is finally proclaimed to be absolutely supreme. Maya\ntherefore denotes abundance.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 14](sbe34020.htm)\n\n"
