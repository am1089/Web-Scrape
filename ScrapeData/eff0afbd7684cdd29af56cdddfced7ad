[1885], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n3:7:2\n\n### SECOND BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n3:7:2:11\\. Verily, as large as the altar is, so large is the earth. The\nsacrificial stakes are thunderbolts; and by means of these thunderbolts he\nobtains possession of this earth, and excludes his enemies from sharing\ntherein. Hence there are eleven stakes, and the twelfth lies aside rough-hewn;\nhe puts it down south (of the altar). The reason why the twelfth lies aside is\nthis.\n\n3:7:2:22\\. Now the gods, while performing this sacrifice,\n\np. 176\n\nwere afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. Those raised (sacrificial\nstakes), then, were as a discharged arrow,--therewith one either smites or\nsmites not; as a hurled club,--therewith one either smites or smites not. But\nthat twelfth (stake) lying aside,--even as an arrow drawn but not discharged,\nas (a weapon) raised but not hurled, so was that a thunderbolt raised for\nrepelling the evil spirits on the south; therefore the twelfth (stake) lies\naside.\n\n3:7:2:33\\. He lays it down with (Va _g_. S. VI, 6), 'This is thy place on\nearth; thine is the beast of the forest.' There are the animal (victim) and\nthe sacrificial stake; to this one he thereby assigns of animals that of the\nforest, and thus it, too, is possessed of an animal (victim). That setting up\nof the eleven sacrificial stakes is said to be of two kinds,--some, namely,\nset (them all) up (on the previous day) for the morrow's Soma feast, and\nothers set up (one) stake for the preparation 1 of the morrow's Soma feast.\n\n3:7:2:44\\. Let him, however, not do this; but let him only set up the one\nopposite the fire. For after setting it up the Adhvaryu does not quit his hold\nof it till the girding; but those (others) remain\n\np. 177\n\nungirt during that night. Thus there would be an offence, since it is for the\nvictim that the stake is set up, and the victim is (only) slaughtered on the\nnext morning: let him therefore set up (the others) on the next morning.\n\n3:7:2:55\\. Let him first set up that (stake) which stands (immediately) north\nof the one opposite the fire, then the one on the south, then a northern one,\n--last of all the one on the southern flank: thus it (the row of stakes)\ninclines to the north.\n\n3:7:2:66\\. But they also say conversely 1, 'Let him first set up that which is\nsouth of the one opposite the fire, then the northern one, then a southern\none,--last of all the one on the northern flank: and thus indeed his work\nattains completion towards the north.'\n\n3:7:2:77\\. Let the largest be the one forming the southern flank; then shorter\nand shorter; and the one forming the northern flank the shortest: thus (the\nrow of stakes) inclines to the north.\n\n3:7:2:88\\. Thereupon they set up the wife-stake for the wives. It is for the\nsake of completeness, forsooth, that the wife-stake is set up: there they\nseize (and bind) the victim for Tvash _t_ _ri_ , for Tvash _t_ _ri_ fashions\nthe cast seed, and hence he fashions the seed now cast. It (the victim to\nTvash _t_ _ri_ ) is an animal with testicles, for such a one is a begetter.\nLet him not slay that one, but let him set it free after fire has been carried\nround it. Were he to slay it, there would assuredly be an end to offspring,\nbut in this way he sets free the offspring. Therefore let him not\n\np. 178\n\nslay it, but let him set it free after fire has been carried round it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[176:1](sbe2628.htm#fr_454) No satisfactory explanation of 'prakubrata' occurs\nto me. It seems to he derived from 'kubra,' to which the dictionaries assign\nthe meanings 'hole for sacrificial fire' and 'thread' (besides those of\n'forest,' 'earring,' and 'cart'). U _n_ ad. II, 28, derives this from a root\n'kub,' to cover, shelter. ? For the safe foundation (or the protraction) of\nto-morrow's Soma feast. The Ka _n_ va text, on the other hand, reads: 'Some,\nnow, raise all (the stakes) on the upavasatha (day before the Soma feast) for\nthe sake of quickening (?prakudratayai) the work, thinking, 'we will quickly\nbring the sacrifice to a close.'\n\n[177:1](sbe2628.htm#fr_455) The Ka _n_ va text first mentions the practice set\nforth in the preceding paragraph, as the teaching of 'some,' but then rejects\nit in favour of the second alternative.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 7, 3.
