 \nNow falsely would the people say,  \nBy idle fancies led astray,  \nThat Rama's own are power and might,  \nAs glorious as the Lord of Light.  \nWhy sinkest thou in such dismay?  \nWhat fears upon thy spirit weigh,  \nThat thou, O Rama, fain wouldst flee  \nFrom her who thinks of naught but thee?  \nTo thy dear will am I resigned  \nIn heart and body, soul and mind,  \nAs Savitri gave all to one,  \nSatyavan, Dyumatsena's son.  1  \nNot e'en in fancy can I brook  \nTo any guard save thee to look:  \nLet meaner wives their houses shame,  \nTo go with thee is all my claim.  \nLike some low actor, deemst thou fit  \nThy wife to others to commit--  \nThine own, espoused in maiden youth,  \nThy wife so long, unblamed for truth?  \nDo thou, my lord, his will obey  \nFor whom thou losest royal sway,  \nTo whom thou wouldst thy wife confide--  \nNot me, but thee, his wish may guide.  \nThou must not here thy wife forsake,  \nAnd to the wood thy journey make,  \nWhether stern penance, grief, and care,  \nOr rule or heaven await thee there.  \nNor shall fatigue my limbs distress  \nWhen wandering in the wilderness:  \nEach path which near to thee I tread  \nShall seem a soft luxurious bed.  \nThe reeds, the bushes where I pass,  \nThe thorny trees, the tangled grass  \nShall feel, if only thou be near,  \nSoft to my touch as skins of deer.  \nWhen the rude wind in fury blows,  \nAnd scattered dust upon me throws,  \nThat dust, beloved lord, to me  \nShall as the precious sandal be.  \nAnd what shall be more blest than I,  \nWhen gazing on the wood I lie  \nIn some green glade upon a bed  \nWith sacred grass beneath us spread?  \nThe root, the leaf, the fruit which thou  \nShalt give me from the earth or bough,  \nScanty or plentiful, to eat,  \nShall taste to me as Amrit sweet.  \nAs there I live on flowers and roots  \nAnd every season's kindly fruits,  \nI will not for my mother grieve,  \nMy sire, my home, or all I leave.  \nMy presence, love, shall never add  \nOne pain to make the heart more sad;  \n\np. 130  \n\nI will not cause thee grief or care,  \nNor be a burden hard to bear.  \nWith thee is heaven, where'er the spot;  \nEach place is hell where thou art not.  \nThen go with me, O Rama; this  \nIs all my hope and all my bliss.  \nIf thou wilt leave thy wife who still  \nEntreats thee with undaunted will,  \nThis very day shall poison close  \nThe life that spurns the rule of foes.  \nHow, after, can my soul sustain  \nThe bitter life of endless pain,  \nWhen thy dear face, my lord, I miss!  \nNo, death is better far than this.  \nNot for an hour could I endure  \nThe deadly grief that knows not cure,  \nFar less a woe I could not shun  \nFor ten long years, and three, and one.'  \n\nWhile fires of woe consumed her, such  \nHer sad appeal, lamenting much;  \nThen with a wild cry, anguish-wrung,  \nAbout her husband's neck she clung.  \nLike some she-elephant who bleeds  \nStruck by the hunter's venomed reeds,  \nSo in her quivering heart she felt  \nThe many wounds his speeches dealt.  \nThen, as the spark from wood is gained,  1  \nDown rolled the tear so long restrained:  \nThe crystal moisture, sprung from woe,  \nFrom her sweet eyes began to flow,  \nAs runs the water from a pair  \nOf lotuses divinely fair.  \nAnd Sita's face with long dark eyes,  \nPure as the moon of autumn skies,  \nFaded with weeping, as the buds  \nOf lotuses when sink the floods.  \nAround his wife his arms he strained,  \nWho senseless from her woe remained,  \nAnd with sweet words, that bade her wake  \nTo life again, the hero spake:  \n'I would not with thy woe, my Queen,  \nBuy heaven and all its blissful sheen.  \nVoid of all fear am I as He,  \nThe self-existent God, can be.  \nI knew not all thy heart till now,  \nDear lady of the lovely brow  \nSo wished not thee in woods to dwell;  \nYet there mine arm can guard thee well.  \nNow surely thou, dear love, wast made  \nTo dwell with me in green wood shade.  \nAnd, as a high saint's tender mind  \nClings to its love for all mankind,  \nSo I to thee will ever cling,  \nSweet daughter of Videha's king.  \nThe good, of old, O soft of frame,  \nHonoured this duty's sovereign claim,  \nAnd I its guidance will not shun,  \nTrue as light's Queen is to the Sun.  \n\nI cannot, pride of Janak's line,  \nThis journey to the wood decline:  \nMy sire's behest, the oath he sware,  \nThe claims of truth, all lead me there.  \nOne duty, dear the same for aye,  \nIs sire and mother to obey:  \nShould I their orders once transgress  \nMy very life were weariness.  \nIf glad obedience be denied  \nTo father, mother, holy guide,  \nWhat rites, what service can be done  \nThat stern Fate's favour may be won?  \nThese three the triple world comprise,  \nO darling of the lovely eyes.  \nEarth has no holy thing like these  \nWhom with all love men seek to please.  \nNot truth, or gift, or bended knee,  \nNot honour, worship, lordly fee,  \nStorms heaven and wins a blessing thence  \nLike sonly love and reverence.  \nHeaven, riches, grain, and varied lore,  \nWith sons and many a blessing more,  \nAll these are made their own with ease  \nBy those their elders' souls who please.  \nThe mighty-souled, who ne'er forget,  \nDevoted sons, their filial debt,  \nWin worlds where Gods and minstrels are,  \nAnd Brahma's sphere more glorious far.  \nNow as the orders of my sire,  \nWho keeps the way of truth, require,  \nSo will I do, for such the way  \nOf duty that endures for aye:  \nTo take thee, love, to Dandak's wild  \nMy heart at length is reconciled,  \nFor thee such earnest thoughts impel  \nTo follow, and with me to dwell.  \nO faultless form from feet to brows,  \nCome with me, as my will allows,  \nAnd duty there with me pursue,  \nTrembler, whose bright eyes thrill me through.  \nIn all thy days, come good come ill,  \nPreserve unchanged such noble will,  \nAnd thou, dear love, wilt ever be  \nThe glory of thy house and me.  \nNow, beauteous-armed, begin the tasks  \nThe woodland life of hermits asks.  \nFor me the joys of heaven above  \nHave charms no more without thee, love.  \nAnd now, dear Sita, be not slow:  \nFood on good mendicants bestow,  \nAnd for the holy Brahmans bring  \nThy treasures and each precious thing.  \nThy best attire and gems collect,  \nThe jewels which thy beauty decked,  \nAnd every ornament and toy  \nPrepared for hours of sport and joy:  \nThe beds, the cars wherein I ride,  \nAmong our followers, next, divide.'  \n\nShe conscious that her lord approved  \nHer going, with great rapture moved,  \n\np. 131  \n\nHastened within, without delay,  \nPrepared to give their wealth away.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[129:1](ry108.htm#fr_304) The story of Savitri, told in the Mahabharat, has\nbeen admirably translated by Ruckert, and elegantly epitomized by Mrs. Manning\nin _India, Ancient and Mediaeval_.
