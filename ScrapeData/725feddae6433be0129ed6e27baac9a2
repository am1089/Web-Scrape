Moreover, the self-luminousness of consciousness has, by our\nopponent himself, been proved on the ground that its essential nature consists\nin illumining (revealing) objects; the self-luminousness of consciousness not\nadmitting of proof apart from its essential nature which consists in the\nlighting up of objects. And as moreover, according to our opponent,\nconsciousness cannot be the object of another consciousness, it would follow\nthat (having neither an object nor itself being an object) it is something\naltogether unreal, imaginary.\n\nNor are you justified in maintaining that in deep sleep, swoon, senselessness\nand similar states, pure consciousness, devoid of any object, manifests\nitself. This view is negatived\n\np. 53\n\nby 'valid non-perception' (see above, [p. 52](sbe48018.htm#page_52)). If\nconsciousness were present in those states also, there would be remembrance of\nit at the time of waking from sleep or recovery from swoon; but as a matter of\nfact there is no such remembrance.--But it is not an absolute rule that\nsomething of which we were conscious must be remembered; how then can the\nabsence of remembrance prove the absence of previous consciousness?--Unless,\nwe reply, there be some cause of overpowering strength which quite obliterates\nall impressions--as e.g. the dissolution of the body--the absence of\nremembrance does necessarily prove the absence of previous consciousness. And,\nmoreover, in the present case the absence of consciousness does not only\nfollow from absence of remembrance; it is also proved by the thought\npresenting itself to the person risen from sleep, 'For so long a time I was\nnot conscious of anything.'--Nor may it be said that even if there was\nconsciousness, absence of remembrance would necessarily follow from the\nabsence (during deep sleep) of the distinction of objects, and from the\nextinction of the consciousness of the 'I'; for the non-consciousness of some\none thing, and the absence of some one thing cannot be the cause of the non-\nremembrance of some other thing, of which there had been consciousness. And\nthat in the states in question the consciousness of the 'I' does persist, will\nmoreover be shown further on.\n\nBut, our opponent urges, have you not said yourself that even in deep sleep\nand similar states there is consciousness marked by difference?--True, we have\nsaid so. But that consciousness is consciousness of the Self, and that this is\naffected by difference will be proved further on. At present we are only\ninterested in denying the existence of your pure consciousness, devoid of all\nobjects and without a substrate. Nor can we admit that your pure consciousness\ncould constitute what we call the consciousness of the Self; for we shall\nprove that the latter has a substrate.\n\nIt thus cannot be maintained that the antecedent non-existence of\nconsciousness does not admit of being proved, because consciousness itself\ndoes not prove it. And as we have shown that consciousness itself may be an\nobject of\n\np. 54\n\nconsciousness, we have thereby disproved the alleged impossibility of\nantecedent non-existence being proved by other means. Herewith falls the\nassertion that the non-origination of consciousness can be proved.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Consciousness is capable of change](sbe48020.htm)\n\n"
