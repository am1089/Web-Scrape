For when that (part) of his body had been restored, Pra _g_ apati\nbecame pregnant with all beings: whilst they were in his womb, evil, death,\nseized them.\n\n8:4:2:22\\. He spake to the gods, 'With you I will free all these beings from\nevil, from death 1!'--'What will accrue unto us therefrom?'--'Choose ye!' said\nhe.--'Let there be a share for us!' said some to him. 'Let lordship be unto\nus!' said others. Having bestowed a share on some, and lordship on others, he\nfreed all beings from evil, from death; and inasmuch as he freed (sp _ri_ )\nthem, therefore (those bricks are called) 'Sp _ri_ ta _h_.' And in like manner\ndoes this Sacrificer, by bestowing a share on some, and lordship on others,\nnow free all beings from evil, from death; and hence (the word) 'sp _ri_ tam\n(freed)' recurs with all of them.\n\n8:4:2:33\\. [He lays them down 2, with, Va _g_. S. XIV, 24-26], Agni's share\nthou art, Diksha's lordship!'--Diksha, doubtless, is Speech: having bestowed a\nshare on Agni, he bestows lordship on Speech;--'the Brahman is freed; the Triv\n_ri_ t-stoma!'--by means of the thrice-threefold hymn-form he freed\n\np. 68\n\nthe Brahman (priesthood) for living beings from evil, from death.\n\n8:4:2:44\\. 'Indra's share thou art, Vish _n_ u's lordship!'--Having bestowed a\nshare on Indra, he bestowed lordship on Vish _n_ u;--'the Kshatra is freed;\nthe Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a-stoma!'--by means of the fifteenfold hymn-form he\nfreed the Kshatra (nobility) for living beings from evil, from death.\n\n8:4:2:55\\. 'The man-viewers' share thou art, the creator's lordship!'--the\nman-viewers, doubtless, are the gods: having bestowed a share on the gods, he\nbestowed lordship on the creator;--'the birthplace is freed, the Saptada _s_\na-stoma!'--the birthplace, doubtless, is the peasantry: by means of the\nseventeenfold hymn-form he frees the peasantry for living beings from evil,\nfrom death.\n\n8:4:2:66\\. 'Mitra's share thou art, Varu _n_ a s lordship!'--Mitra, doubtless,\nis the out-breathing, and Varu _n_ a the down-breathing: having bestowed a\nshare on the out-breathing, he bestowed lordship on the down-\nbreathing;--'heaven's rain, the wind is freed; the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a-stoma!'--by\nmeans of the twenty-one-fold hymn-form he frees both rain and wind for living\nbeings from evil, from death.\n\n8:4:2:77\\. 'The Vasus' share thou art, the Rudras' lordship!'--having bestowed\na share on the Vasus, he bestowed lordship on the Rudras;--'the four-footed is\nfreed, the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a-stoma!'--by means of the twenty-five-fold\nhymn-form he freed the four-footed for living beings from evil, from death.\n\n8:4:2:88\\. 'The \xc3\x82dityas' share thou art, the Maruts' lordship!'--having\nbestowed a share on the \xc3\x82dityas, he bestowed lordship on the Maruts;--'the\n\np. 69\n\nembryos are freed, the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avi _m_ _s_ a-stoma!'--by means of the\ntwenty-five-fold hymn-form he freed the embryos for living beings from evil,\nfrom death.\n\n8:4:2:99\\. 'Aditi's share thou art, Pushan's lordship!'--Aditi, doubtless, is\nthis (earth): having bestowed a share on her, he bestowed lordship on\nPushan,--'vigour is freed; the Tri _n_ ava-stoma!' by means of the thrice-\nninefold hymn-form he freed vigour for living beings from evil, from death.\n\n8:4:2:1010\\. 'God Savit _ri_ 's share thou art, B _ri_ haspati's lordship!'--\nhaving bestowed a share on the god Savit _ri_ , he bestows lordship on B _ri_\nhaspati;--'the facing quarters are freed, the _K_ atush _t_ oma!'--by means of\nthe chant of praise consisting of four stomas he freed all the (four) quarters\nfor living beings from evil, from death.\n\n8:4:2:1111\\. 'The Yavas' share thou art, the Ayavas' lordship!'--the Yavas,\ndoubtless, are the first (light) fortnights, and the Ayavas the latter (dark)\nfortnights, for these gain (yu) and obtain (a-yu) everything here 1: having\nbestowed a share on the first fortnights, he bestowed lordship on the latter\nfortnights;--'the creatures are freed, the _K_ atus _k_ atvari _m_ _s_\na-stoma!'--by means of the forty-four-fold hymn-form he freed all creatures\nfrom evil, from death.\n\n8:4:2:1212\\. 'The Ribhus' share thou art, the All-gods' lordship!'--having\nbestowed a share on the Ribhus, he bestowed lordship on the Vi _s_ ve-Deva _h_\n;--\n\np. 70\n\n[paragraph continues] 'the living being is freed, the Trayastri _m_ _s_\na-stoma!'--by means of the thirty-three-fold hymn-form he freed all living\nbeings from evil, from death; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by means\nof the thirty-three-fold hymn-form, now free all living beings from evil, from\ndeath.\n\n8:4:2:1313\\. These, then, are ten bricks he lays down,--the Vira _g_ consists\nof ten syllables, and Agni is Vira _g_ (wide-shining); there are ten regions,\nand Agni is the regions; there are ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs:\nas great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus frees all\nthese creatures from evil, from death.\n\n8:4:2:1414\\. He then lays down two _Ri_ tavyas 1 (seasonal bricks);--the\nseasonal ones being the same as the seasons, it is the seasons he thus lays\ndown;--with (Va _g_. S. XIV, 27), 'Saha and Sahasya, the two winter-seasons!'\nThese are the names of those two, it is with their names he thus lays them\ndown. There are two such bricks, for a season consists of two months. Only\nonce he settles them: he thus makes (the two months) one season.\n\n8:4:2:1515\\. And as to why he places these two (bricks) in this (layer),--this\nAgni (fire-altar) is the year, and the year is these worlds: what part thereof\nis above the air, and below the sky, that is this fourth layer, and that is\nthe winter-season thereof; and when he places these two in this (layer), he\nthereby restores to him (Pra _g_ apati-Agni, the year and fire-altar) what\npart of his body these two (constitute). This is why he places these two in\nthis (layer).\n\np. 71\n\n8:4:2:1616\\. And, again, as to why he places these two in this (layer),--this\nAgni is Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is the year: what (part) of him there\nis above the waist, and below the head, that is this fourth layer, and that is\nthe winter-season of him (or, of it, the year). And when he places these two\nin this (layer), he thereby restores to him what part of his body these two\n(constitute). This is why he places these two in this (layer).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[66:2](sbe4316.htm#fr_138) The ten Sp _ri_ ta _h_ are placed in close\nconnection with the preceding set;--viz. at the front and back ends of the\nspine, two p. 67 bricks, exactly corresponding in size to those already lying\nthere, are placed south and north of these respectively. Similarly two bricks,\na foot square, are placed on the 'cross-spine' immediately north of the two\nstoma-bricks lying there. The remaining six bricks are then placed behind the\nrow of fourteen 'stomas' in the front part of the altar, three on each side of\nthe spine.\n\n[67:1](sbe4316.htm#fr_139) Or, from that evil, death.\n\n[67:2](sbe4316.htm#fr_140) In the case of the first four Sp _ri_ ta _h_ , as\nin that of the corresponding Stomas (see p. 6r, note r), while the bricks\nthemselves are laid down in the order E. W. N. S., the order in which the\nformulas are given in paragraphs 3-6, is that of E. N. S.W.--Cp. Katy. _S_\nrautas. XVII, 10, 11-14. For a symbolical explanation of this change of order,\nsee [VIII, 4, 4, 1](sbe4318.htm#8:4:4:1) seq.\n\n[69:1](sbe4316.htm#fr_141) This is clearly a fanciful etymology. If 'yava' and\n'ayava,' in the sense of the bright and dark fortnights, are really genuine\nterms, it is more likely that they are derived from yu, 'to keep off,'--the\nbright half of the moon being looked upon as capable of averting evil spirits,\nand the dark half as the reverse of this.\n\n[70:1](sbe4316.htm#fr_142) These are placed over the _Ri_ tavyas of the\npreceding layers, viz. in the fifth place to the east of the centre, south and\nnorth of the spine.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 4, 3.
