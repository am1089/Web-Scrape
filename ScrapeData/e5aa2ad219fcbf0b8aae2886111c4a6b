Both of these brothers having\nattained Atmic wisdom, lived in the forest. For many years they enjoyed the\nquiet pleasures of solitude and at last reached the calm of bodiless bliss\n*--like lights which have consumed both wick and oil. For this is the fate of\nall beings.\n\n"If one, in his many incarnations is related to all, where then, is the\nnecessity of love or hate? The most reasonable course is to forego extreme and\nexcessive desires, not to enlarge upon them. If desire is allowed to flourish\nlit becomes food for contemplation. When desire passes, so does the structure\nof thought built about it, collapse and perish. This is indeed. truth.\n\np. 114\n\n"O Ram, mount the great edifice of renunciation and behold in spiritual vision\nthis insignificant universe palpitating with unruly desires--then you will\nindeed know that you lack nothing. This exalted state contains the truth of\nBrahma without. impurity, delusion or the plague of ignorance. If this state\nbe attained by faith even though the intelligence is meager, its devotees will\nnot be subject to delusion. Therefore, O Ram, lead thus your life.\n\n"With the progressive development of intelligence and the exercise of a fine\ndiscrimination all pain will cease. Even though one may find a close ally in a\nGuru, ** it is only through individual energy and will, that all pains arising\nfrom association with kinsmen and heterogeneity can be destroyed. Having\nlabored diligently through Atmic enquiry, books of wisdom, and noble\nbenevolence, your mind is forced to follow the Atmic life--then pain will\ncease. The collective wealth of all worlds will not compare with the happiness\narising from the blissful mind which has found emancipation.\n\np. 115\n\n"Like a sandal protects the foot, however stony the path, so also, does the\nmind fill the whole of creation with purest joy. A mind filled to the fullest\nwith neutrality of vision will never entertain mundane desire; nor a mind\nconfused by conflicting desires ever have its grievances completely redressed.\nA mind free from desire yields pure thoughts, as readily as Muni Agastya\nsipped the waters of the ocean in the space of a moment; the radiance of the\nfull moon has not such refulgence, nor does Lakshmi * reposing on fragrant\nLotus grant such a boon.\n\n"The ghosts of desire will dim the lustre of the stainless mind just as clouds\nhide the moon, or black stains deface polished stone. Liberation means only\nthe destruction of the impurities of the mind and this mind is developed only\nwhen desire and fears of rebirth are destroyed. If this is not possible, O\nRam, thou shalt arrive at wisdom by the path followed by the great Bali. Such\na course is beneficial."\n\nThereupon Ram asked him to relate the story of Bali.\n\np. 116\n\nRishi Vashisht replied: "There once lived a great king who was also a great\negoist. He reigned over Patala ** as an emperor. The whole world trembled\nbeneath his autocratic rule; even the gods were overpowered and humbled before\nhim. He was the son of the noble Virochana, and reigned mightily for ten\nmillion years.\n\n"One day he mounted to the parapet atop his palace--his palace which was\nstudded with gems brought from the Manhameru *** Heights. There in solitude he\nspoke the travail of his mind. He was satiated with the material pleasure of\nhis world and his speech was replete with bitterness.\n\n"\'Of what avail is this undisputed sovereignty which has enable me to enjoy\nthe wealth of these three worlds, when I reflect that the pleasures of wealth\nare but fleeting, and that I repeat to-day\'s actions again tomorrow with only\na gain of momentary [happiness](errata.htm#11)? Enjoyed incidents do recur\nagain; ornaments worn proudly yesterday are put on again to-day. We observe\nthat even\n\np. 117\n\nthe intelligent do not become appeased by these recurrences and are not\nashamed to enjoy them again, like children who feast repeatedly on sweets.\n\n"\'Thy cycle of days, months, years and yugas roll on, and the old is ever old,\nthough decked in the changing garments of the mode.\n\n"\'Has the faithful performance of my duties improved my life in the slightest\ndegree? What will bring me possession of THAT and free me of action and its\nresults? Where is the path which will lead me to THAT which is peace, free\nfrom illusion?\'\n\n"Deep in reflection he sought the Principle which is eternal and at last was\nrewarded by the solution. With eyes flashing with joy he burst into speech.\n\n"\'It was in this very place that I enquired about this Principle from my\nomniscient father, Virochana. He explained then the manner in which I might\nremove my doubts when I asked (him, what is that incomparable state in which\nthe illusions of pain and pleasure are lost, wherein the mind\'s delusions find\noblivion, and where desires are uprooted?\' I begged that he would\n\np. 118\n\ndescribe to me the attainment of that goal which knows not the \'restraint of\ndesires and the gloomy despondences of the mind.\n\n"\'Tell me, O Father, I beseech thee what is the state which is wholly\npermeated with Absolute bliss? O thou Knower of the Supreme, enlighten me and\nrelease me from the torment of doubts which arise!\'\n\n"And thus Virochana replied:\n\n"\'Harken to my words. There is a beautiful country which is illimitable and\nall pervading. In it the worlds arise and into it the worlds are absorbed. In\nthis country there are not the five grand elements, nor are there hills,\nforest, temples, Devas or even the ancient souls. Illumination is the name of\nthe King who exists there, alone. He is omnipotent, omniscient, the cause of\nall, perfectly quiescent and refulgent. He is Silence itself. He will\nunfailingly cause all acts to be performed by a minister appointed by him. The\ninstant that a thought arises in the minister, the idea, though previously\nnon-existent, immediately crystallizes into actuality and as mysteriously\ndisappears. The minister enjoys nothing by his own right nor does he know\nanything. Acting always in concert\n\np. 119\n\nwith the King he is able to do all things. Though the minister stands always\nin the presence of the King, the King remains invisible and solitary.\'\n\n"So saith the father to his son.\n\n"The son had listened appreciatively to the words of his father. Now he\nquestioned.\n\n"\'What is the character of this enlightened country which is without disease\nand misery,. which though apart, yet pervades all? How can it be reached? By\nwhat means can it be attained? Who is the immortal King of that strange\ncountry? Who is his minister? Who is the mighty King, who, as if in sport,\nwill make me ruler of this universe?\'\n\n"His father answered. \'Who is able to over-step the rigorous law of the\npowerful minister? Even though the hosts of the world beleaguer him, they can\nnever overpower him. Though spears be hurled against him they will be as\nfutile as flowers flung at a stone wall. Only the King can command obeisance\nfrom his minister, for it were easier to move the great Himalayas than to\nbring Him into subjection. It takes a very superior intelligence\n\np. 120\n\nto subdue the minister, for he is like an angry serpent who when trod upon\nwill hiss and strike.\n\n"\'All this, my son, is symbolic. The country in my story is liberation,\nincomparable and eternal; the King is Atmic Reality, inseparable from\n\'liberation and refulgent with eternal light; the -minister of the King\ntypifies the mind or intelligence. The symbol and realization of supreme\nauthority is the subjection, control and eradication of sensual pleasures and\nthe building-up of an indifference to them. When the mind has overcome desire,\nthen it resembles a mischievous elephant safely caged.\n\n"\'Those unacquainted with the true books of wisdom maintain that of the four\nparts into which they divide time, one-half should be devoted to a study of\nsensual objects, one-quarter to study of the Books of Wisdom, and the\nremaining quarter to the worship of a blessed Guru (spiritual teacher); that\nif this be done, wisdom will replace ignorance.\n\n"\'The partially knowing assert that of the four divisions one should devote\nhalf the time to contemplation and worship of a Guru, a quarter to meditation\nupon the spiritual truths\n\np. 121\n\ncontained in the Books of Wisdom, and the remaining quarter to the study of\nthe actions of the sensual organs. The wisdom will prevail in him, and he will\nknow the supreme truth.\n\n"\'The third class, who are of the wise elect;. affirm that liberation will be\nattained by those, who, dividing the concentration of the mind into four parts\ndevote them to the four purposes of a study of the Books of Wisdom, which\noutline the pursuit of the path of Atmic Reality. Self-knowledge,\ndesirelessness, worship, and worship of a Guru.\n\n"May you, my son, through diligent enquiry and intelligent effort, understand\nAtmic worship and the subjugation of desire simultaneously. By a determined\nmaster of your desires, Atmic enquiry naturally follows, and in turn Atmic\nenquiry induces a relinquishment of desire. They are mutually dependent one\nupon the other, like\' the clouds which fill the ocean.\n\n"\'Having earned, in proper ways, wealth for. relieving one\'s kindred and\ndependents. one should, by the help of that wealth, promote the qualities of\ntruthful conduct and gradually assume indifference to the world of objects and\n\np. 122\n\nfutile pleasures. This is the state those reach who live in Jnana (wisdom).\nThis is the glory of peace.\'\n\n"Soliloquizing thus, he asked himself, \'Who am I and what is my real nature?\'\nAfter a moment\'s reflection he concluded that if he invoked his Guru, who had\nattained Realization, and should enquire of him the truth, then ignorance\nwould forsake him. Therefore, with closed eyes he meditated affectionately\nupon his Guru. Thereupon his Guru took form before him, a form constituted of\nthe blessed air. With an enraptured heart the King saluted him and spread\nfragrant flowers before the resplendent Guru.\n\n"Beloved Guru, deign to hear my words and bless me accordingly. What is the\nNOW? What is there BEYOND? What is THAT which is limited? Who am I who speaks?\nAnd YOU who hear? What is this material universe? Favor me, Divinity, with\nanswers to quiet all my doubts.\'\n\n"\'The Guru pondered for a moment and then replied: \'I am on my way to Heaven\nwhere dwell the immortals. Why should I take unnecessary time or waste words?\nBriefly, I tell you this, all the manifestations before us here are wrought\n\np. 123\n\nof wisdom, the unmanifested is also wisdom; I, who speak, am wisdom, and pure\nwisdom are you, who hear. The entire universe is naught but all-full wisdom.\nTake these conclusions, impress them upon your mind and meditate upon the\nReality of Wisdom. If you can accept Reality, you will attain the Supreme\nstate. The Sapta-Rishi * has just now entered a new state; therefore, I shall\npass.\' So saying the Guru of Bali retired.\n\n"Contemplating the truth of his Guru\'s words, he became convinced that ALL IS\nWISDOM. This earth is none other than the manifestation of Wisdom; the three\nworlds are Jnana; my real nature is Jnana. The fates are Jnana. I have become\nthe shining Brahmic One, who scintillates undimmed by the visual or the\nsensual. I have become the One principle, which unbound by objectives,\npervades all at one and the same time--intelligence itself.\n\n"Mentally vibrating to Om, which is the true significator of Absolute Wisdom,\nBali entered a\n\np. 124\n\ntrance-like state, which was free from thought, desire or doubts, and there he\nremained statue-like in Samadhi for a long period.\n\n"Thus did the Emperor Bali remain motionless, as the flame of a lighted lamp\nin a sheltered, windless place. And since he was illumined by the Truth,\nunstained by love or hate, his mind merged into Divine Peace. Such a condition\ncan best be compared to clear, autumnal sky.\n\n"Seeking their Emperor, his courtiers found him deep in Samadhi.\n\n"After a long time, Bali awoke and went about his regal duties, his mind free\nfrom desire and egotism. His pure mind was never again flurried in adversity\nor prosperity, neither did he lose himself in either pleasure or pain. Thus\nhis equable gaze viewed all impartially, however numerous were the hosts of\ngood and had thoughts that arose in his mind. As the procession of countless\nobjects passed before him, the controlled them all.\n\n"So shall you, O Ram, pillion your mind, roving amid the pleasures of this and\nhigher worlds, in the centre of your heart. Wherever your mind stumbles like\nan awkward child and falls into\n\np. 125\n\nsensuality, you must lift it to the indivisible Jnana and there let your mind\nbecome one with wisdom. By daily and consistent practice you may chain the\nterrible elephant of mind, so that [untrammeled](errata.htm#12) by pain, you\nwill enable it to reach liberation through control."\n\nSo saith the great Master, Rishi Vashisht.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[113:*](yvhf09.htm#fr_3) Death.\n\n[114:**](yvhf09.htm#fr_4) Spiritual Teacher.\n\n[115:*](yvhf09.htm#fr_5) Goddess of wealth.\n\n[116:**](yvhf09.htm#fr_6) America.\n\n[116:***](yvhf09.htm#fr_7) Himalaya Mountains.\n\n[123:*](yvhf09.htm#fr_8) One of the seven Rishis.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: King Janak](yvhf10.htm)\n\n'
