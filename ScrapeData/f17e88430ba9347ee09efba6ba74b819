May he release the offspring of this\nwife from the fetter of death. That may this king Varu _n_ a grant, that this\nwife may not weep over distress (falling to her lot) through her sons. Svaha!\n\n\'May Agni Garhapatya protect this woman. May he lead her offspring to old age.\nWith fertile womb may she be the mother of living children. May she experience\ndelight in her sons. Svaha!\n\n\'May no noise that comes from thee, arise in the house by night. May the (she-\ngoblins called) the weeping ones take their abode in another (woman)\n\np. 188\n\nthan thee. Mayst thou not be beaten at thy breast by (the she-goblin) Vike _s_\ni ("the rough-haired one"). May thy husband live, and mayst thou shine in thy\nhusband\'s world, beholding thy genial offspring! Svaha!\n\n\'May Heaven protect thy back, Vayu thy thighs, and the two A _s_ vins thy\nbreast. May Savit _ri_ protect thy suckling sons. Until the garment is put on\n(thy sons?), may B _ri_ haspati guard (them?), and the Vi _s_ ve devas\nafterwards. Svaha!\n\n\'Childlessness, the death of sons, evil, and distress, I take (from thee), as\na wreath (is taken) from the head, and (like a wreath) I put all evil on (the\nhead of) our foes. Svaha!\n\n\'With this well-disposed prayer which the gods have created, I kill the Pi _s_\na _k_ as that dwell in thy womb. The flesh-devouring death-bringers I cast\ndown. May thy sons live to old age. Svaha!\'\n\n8\\.
