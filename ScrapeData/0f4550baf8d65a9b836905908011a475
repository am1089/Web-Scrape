Wishes and the rest, here and there; (as is known from the abode, and so\non).\n\nWe read in the _Kh_ andogya (VIII, I, 1), 'There is that city of Brahman, and\nin it the palace, the small lotus, and in it that small ether,' &c.; and in\nthe Va _g_ asaneyaka, 'He is that great unborn Self who consists of\nknowledge,' and so on. A doubt here arises whether the two texts constitute\none meditation or not.--The two meditations are separate, the Purvapakshin\nmaintains; for they have different characters. The _Kh_ andogya represents as\nthe object of meditation the ether as distinguished by eight different\nattributes, viz. freedom from all evil and the rest; while, according to the\nVa _g_ asaneyaka, the being to be meditated on is he who dwells within that\nether, and is distinguished by attributes such as lordship, and so on.--To\nthis we reply that the meditations are not distinct, since there is no\ndifference of character. For desires and so on constitute that character 'here\nand there,' i.e. in both texts nothing else but Brahman distinguished by\nattributes, such as having true wishes, and so on, forms the subject of\nmeditation. This is known 'from the abode and so on,'\n\np. 661\n\ni.e. the meditation is recognised as the same because in both texts Brahman is\nreferred to as abiding in the heart, being a bridge, and so on. Lordship and\nthe rest, which are stated in the Va _g_ asaneyaka, are special aspects of the\nquality of being capable to realise all one's purposes, which is one of the\neight qualities declared in the _Kh_ andogya, and as such prove that all the\nattributes going together with that quality in the _Kh_ andogya are valid for\nthe Va _g_ asaneyaka also. The character of the two vidyas therefore does not\ndiffer. The connexion with a reward also does not differ, for it consists in\nboth cases in attaining to Brahman; cp. _Kh._ Up. VIII, 12,3 'Having\napproached the highest light he is manifested in his own form,' and B _ri_.\nUp. V, 4, 24 'He becomes indeed the fearless Brahman.' That, in the _Kh_\nandogya-text, the term _ether_ denotes the highest Brahman, has already been\ndetermined under I, 3, 14. As in the Va _g_ asaneyaka, on the other hand, he\nwho abides in the ether is recognised as the highest Self, we infer that by\nthe ether in which he abides must be understood the ether within the heart,\nwhich in the text 'within there is a little hollow space (sushira)' (Mahanar.\nUp. XI, 9) is called sushira. The two meditations are therefore one. Here an\nobjection is raised. It cannot be maintained that the attributes mentioned in\nthe _Kh_ andogya have to be combined with those stated in the Va _g_ asaneyaka\n(lordship, rulership, &c.), since even the latter are not truly valid for the\nmeditation. For the immediately preceding passage, 'By the mind it is to be\nperceived that there is here no plurality: from death to death goes he who\nsees here any plurality; as one only is to be seen that eternal being, not to\nbe proved by any means of proof,' as well as the subsequent text, 'that Self\nis to be described by No, no,' shows that the Brahman to be meditated upon is\nto be viewed as devoid of attributes; and from this we infer that the\nattributes of lordship and so on, no less than the qualities of grossness and\nthe like, have to be denied of Brahman. From this again we infer that in the\n_Kh_ andogya also the attributes of satyakamatva and so on are not meant to be\ndeclared as Brahman's true qualities. All such qualities--\n\np. 662\n\nas not being real qualities of Brahman--have therefore to be omitted in\nmeditations aiming at final release.--This objection the next Sutra disposes\nof.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 39.
