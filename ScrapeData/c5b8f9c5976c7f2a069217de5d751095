With tears his eyes grew dim,  \nHis senses all deserted him.  \nHe cried, O Rama, once, then weak  \nAnd fainting could no further speak.  \nUnconscious there he lay: at length  \nRegathering his sense and strength,  \nWhile his full eyes their torrents shed,  \nTo wise Sumantra thus he said:  \n'Yoke the light car, and hither lead  \nFleet coursers of the noblest breed,  \nAnd drive this heir of lofty fate  \nBeyond the limit of the state.  \nThis seems the fruit that virtues bear,  \nThe meed of worth which texts declare--  \nThe sending of the brave and good  \nBy sire and mother to the wood.'  \n\nHe heard the monarch, and obeyed,  \nWith ready feet that ne'er delayed,  \nAnd brought before the palace gate  \nThe horses and the car of state.  \nThen to the monarch's son he sped,  \nAnd raising hands of reverence said  \n\np. 141  \n\nThat the light car which gold made fair,  \nWith best of steeds, was standing there.  \nKing Das'aratha called in haste  \nThe lord o'er all his treasures placed.  \nAnd spoke, well skilled in place and time,  \nHis will to him devoid of crime:  \n'Count all the years she has to live  \nAfar in forest wilds, and give  \nTo Sita robes and gems of price  \nAs for the time may well suffice.'  \nQuick to the treasure-room he went,  \nCharged by that king most excellent,  \nBrought the rich stores, and gave them all  \nTo Sita in the monarch's hall.  \nThe Maithil dame of high descent  \nReceived each robe and ornament,  \nAnd tricked those limbs, whose lines foretold  \nHigh destiny, with gems and gold.  \nSo well adorned, so fair to view,  \nA glory through the hall she threw:  \nSo, when the Lord of Light upsprings,  \nHis radiance o'er the sky he flings.  \nThen Queen Kaus'alya spake at last,  \nWith loving arms about her cast,  \nPressed lingering kisses on her head,  \nAnd to the high-souled lady said:  \n'Ah, in this faithless world below  \nWhen dark misfortune comes and woe,  \nWives, loved and cherished every day,  \nNeglect their lords and disobey.  \nYes, woman's nature still is this:--  \nAfter long days of calm and bliss  \nWhen some light grief her spirit tries,  \nShe changes all her love, or flies.  \nYoung wives are thankless, false in soul,  \nWith roving hearts that spurn control.  \nBrooding on sin and quickly changed,  \nIn one short hour their love estranged.  \nNot glorious deed or lineage fair,  \nNot knowledge, gift, or tender care  \nIn chains of lasting love can bind  \nA woman's light inconstant mind.  \nBut those good dames who still maintain  \nWhat right, truth, Scripture, rule ordain--  \nNo holy thing in their pure eyes  \nWith one beloved husband vies.  \nNor let thy lord my son, condemned  \nTo exile, be by thee contemned,  \nFor be he poor or wealthy, he  \nIs as a God, dear child, to thee.'  \n\nWhen Sita heard Kaus'alya's speech  \nHer duty and her gain to teach,  \nShe joined her palms with reverent grace  \nAnd gave her answer face to face:  \n'All will I do, forgetting naught,  \nWhich thou,O honoured Queen, hast taught.  \nI know, have heard, and deep have stored  \nThe rules of duty to my lord.  \nNot me, good Queen, shouldst thou include  \nAmong the faithless multitude.  \nIts own sweet light the moon shall leave  \nEre I to duty cease to cleave.  \nThe stringless lute gives forth no strain,  \nThe wheelless car is urged in vain;  \nNo joy a lordless dame, although  \nBlest with a hundred sons, can know.  \nFrom father, brother, and from son  \nA measured share of joy is won:  \nWho would not honour, love, and bless  \nHer lord, whose gifts are measureless?  \nThus trained to think, I hold in awe  \nScripture's command and duty's law.  \nHim can I hold in slight esteem?  \nHer lord is woman's God, I deem.'  \nKaus'alya heard the lady's speech,  \nNor failed those words her heart to reach.  \nThen, pure in mind, she gave to flow  \nThe tear that sprang of joy and woe.  \nThen duteous Rama forward came  \nAnd stood before the honoured dame,  \nAnd joining reverent hands addressed  \nThe queen in rank above the rest:  \n'O mother, from these tears refrain;  \nLook on my sire and still thy pain.  \nTo thee my days afar shall fly  \nAs if sweet slumber closed thine eye,  \nAnd fourteen years of exile seem  \nTo thee, dear mother, like a dream.  \nOn me returning safe and well,  \nGirt by my friends, thine eyes shall dwell.'  \n\nThus for their deep affection's sake  \nThe hero to his mother spake,  \nThen to the half seven hundred too.  \nWives of his sire, paid reverence due.  \nThus Das'aratha's son addressed  \nThat crowd of matrons sore distressed:  \n'If from these lips, while here I dwelt,  \nOne heedless taunt you e'er have felt,  \nForgive me, pray. And now adieu,  \nI bid good-bye to all of you.'  \nThen straight, like curlews' cries, upwent  \nThe voices of their wild lament,  \nWhile, as he bade farewell, the crowd  \nOf royal women wept aloud,  \nAnd through the ample hall's extent.  \nWhere erst the sound of tabour, blent  \nWith drum and shrill-toned instrument,  \n   In joyous concert rose,  \nNow rang the sound of wailing high,  \nThe lamentation and the cry,  \nThe shriek, the choking sob, the sigh  \n   That told the ladies' woes.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XL.: Rama's Departure.](ry118.htm)\n\n"
