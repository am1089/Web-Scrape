Narada spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! I am now very eager to hear the special Puja\nof S\xc2\x92ri Devi. The people get their desires fulfilled if they worship Her.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n2-23. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Devar _s_ i! I shall now specially speak to you\nhow the World Mother Bhagavati is worshipped; by worshipping Whom one easily\ngets objects of enjoyments, liberation and the destruction of all evils.\nControlling one\xc2\x92s speech and making \xc3\x82chaman, one must make one\xc2\x92s sankalpa and\nperform Bhutas\xc2\x92uddhi, Matrikanyasa, _s_ adanganyasa, placing conchshell and\ndoing other necessary acts. Offering the ordinary Arghya, one should give\nspecial Arghya and with the mantra \xc2\x93Astraya Pha _t_ \xc2\x94 sprinkle over all the\narticles brought for worship. Taking the Guru\xc2\x92s permission, he is to go on\nwith his Puja. First worship the pi _t_ ha or seat whereon the Devi would be\nplaced; then perform dhyan (meditation of the Devi). Then with great devotion,\noffer to the Deva, the seats (\xc3\x82sana) and other articles of worship; then\nperform the bath of the Devi by the water of the Panchamrita (the five\nnectars). If anybody performs the bath ceremony of S\xc2\x92ri Devi with one hundred\njars of sugarcane juice, he will not have to incur any future birth.\n\n\n\nHe who performs this bath, and recites the Veda Mantras, with mango juice or\nsugarcane juice gets for ever Lak _s_ mi ever and ever and Sarasvati bound at\nhis doors. He who gets this sacred bath of the Devi with grape juice, along\nwith his relatives and acquaintences dwells in the Devi-loka for as many years\nas there are atoms in the juice. He who bathes the Devi with the Vedic\nmantras, and with water scented with camphor, the fragrant aloe wood (aguru),\nsaffron, and musk, becomes freed at once of the sins acquired in his hundred\nbirths. He who bathes the Devi with jars of milk, lives in the ocean of milk\n(k _s_ ira samudra) for one Kalpa. So he who does this bathing ceremony with\njars of curd, becomes the lord of Dadhiku _nd_ a (the reservoir of curd). He\nwho performs the Snanams of the Devi with honey, ghee and sugar becomes the\nlord of these things. He who bathes the Devi with one thousand jars, becomes\nhappy in this world as in the next. Note :-- Make the liquid current flow pure\nin your body is the esoteric meaning of the bath. If you give Her a pair of\nsilken clothes, you will go to the Vayu-Loka. If you give Her\n\n\n\np. 1111\n\n\n\nthe jewel ornaments, you will become the Lord of gems and jewels. (Make your\nmind like the gem.) If anybody gives saffron, sandalpaste, musk, Sindura and\n\xc3\x82laktak (red things), he will go to the Heavens and become there the Indra,\nthe Lord of the Devas, in the next birth. Various flowers ought to be offered\nin S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavati\xc2\x92s worship; or the flowers of the season offered to the Devi\nwill lead the devotee to Kailas\xc2\x92a. The devotee that offers the beautiful Bel\nleaves to the Devi never experiences anywhere pains and difficulties. The\ndevotee who writes the Vija mantra of Maya \xc2\x93Hrim Bhuvanes\xc2\x92varyai Nama _h_ \xc2\x94\nwith red sandalpaste thrice on the tri-leaves of the Vilva tree leaf and\noffers this to the lotus feet of the Devi, becomes Manu by the merit of this\nvirtuous act! The devotee becomes the Lord of the whole universe who worships\nthe Devi Bhagavati with ten millions of entire Vilva leaves, fresh, green and\nspotless.\n\n\n\n24-40. If any devotee worships with ten millions of entire fresh green Ku _nd_\na flowers, with eight scents, he gets surely the Prajapatihood. The worship of\nthe Devi with ten millions of Mallika and Malati flowers besmeared with eight\nscents makes a man the four faced (Brahma); and one hundred millions of such\nflowers will make the devotee a Vi _sn_ u. In days of yore, Vi _sn_ u\nworshipped the Devi in the aforesaid way and so got His Vi _sn_ uhood. If any\ndevotee worships the Devi with one hundred Ko _t_ is of Mallika or Malati\nflowers, the man becomes certainly Sutratma Hira _n_ yagarbha. In ancient days\nHira _n_ yagarbha worshipped thus the Devi with great devotion and so he\nbecame Hira _n_ yagarbha! (These Hira _n_ yagarbha, Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and\nMahes\xc2\x92a were mere ordinary men before. See the Brihadara _n_ yaka Upani _s_\nada). Note :-- The eight scents refer to Ja _t_ a mamsi Kapiyuta\nS\xc2\x92aktergandhas _t_ akam! So will be the results if Java, Vandhuka and Da _d_\nimi flowers be offered in the worship. Various other beautiful flowers can be\noffered duly to the Devi by the devotee. The merits accruing from such offers\nare not known even to the God \xc3\x8es\xc2\x92vara. The flowers that spring in their proper\nseasons are to be offered every year to the Devi, repeating Her thousand names\nenumerated in the Twelfth Book or in the Kurma Pura _n_ a. If the above\nworship be offered to the Devi, then that man, whether he be a sinner or a\ngreat sinner, will be freed from all the sins and after leaving his mortal\ncoil, he will get, no doubt, the lotus feet of the S\xc2\x92ri Devi Bhagavati. Offer\nDhupa made of black Aguru, camphor, sandalpaste, red sandalpaste, Sihlaka and\nGuggula, saturated with ghee in such a way as the whole room of S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavati\nscents with pure\n\n\n\np. 1112\n\n\n\nfragrant smell. The Devi Bhagavati becomes pleased with this and offers the\nlordship of the three Lokas to the devotee. The devotee, who offers daily the\nlight of camphor to the Devi, goes to the Surya Loka. There is no doubt in\nthis. With one\xc2\x92s whole heart, one should give one hundred or one thousand\nlights to the Devi. The devotee should offer heaps of food consisting of six\nRasas, the plates and dishes for chewing, sucking, licking and drinking, that\nis, all kinds of food solid, and liquid, mountain-like high. Always give food\non golden flat plates and cups and various delicious sweet juicy nice heavenly\nfruits, nicely arranged on trays, cups and saucers. When S\xc2\x92ri Mahadevi\nBhuvane\xc2\x92svari gets pleased, the whole universe gets pleased. For the whole\nUniverse is all Devi; as a rope is mistaken for a snake, so this Mahadevi is\nmistaken for the universe.\n\n\n\n41-59. Offer a jar of drinking Ganges water, cool and nice, scented with\ncamphor to the Devi; then offer betels with camphor, cardamum, cloves, and\nvarious delicious scents. These all are to be offered with great devotion so\nthat the Devi may be pleased. Next have music with lovely mrida _n_ gas,\nflutes, murajas, Dhahkas and dundubhis and so please Her. The Veda mantras are\nto be recited, the Pura _n_ as are to be read and the hymns to be chanted.\nWith whole head and heart offer to the Devi the umbrella and chamara, the two\nkingly offerings. Then circumambulate round Her and prostrate before Her and\nask Her kindness and pray to Her to forgive all faults and shortcomings. The\nDevi is pleased with anybody who remembers Her even once! What wonder then\nthat She will be pleased with all these offerings! The Mother is naturally\nmerciful to her child. When She is loved with devotion, then She becomes very\nmerciful. There is nothing strange here! On this point I will recite to you\nthe history of Vrihadratha Rajar _s_ i. Hearing which gives rise to Bhakti and\nLove.\n\n\n\nOnce in a certain region in the Himalayas there lived a bird called Chakravak.\nIt flew over many countries and went once to Kas\xc2\x92idham. As a fruit of his\nPrarabdha Karma, that bird, desirous to find some rice beans, voluntarily went\nlike an orphan round about the temple of S\xc2\x92ri Annapur _n_ a Devi. There\ncircumambulating round the Devi Bhagavati the bird left the city Kas\xc2\x92i, that\ngrants liberation and flew away to another country. In time the bird left his\nbody and went to Heavens. There he assumed a heavenly form of a youth and\nbegan to enjoy various pleasures. Thus he enjoyed for two Kalpas. Then he got\nback to the earth and took his birth as the best in the K _s_ attriya family.\nHe became celebrated as the king Vrihadratha in\n\n\n\np. 1113\n\n\n\nthis world. That King was truthful, controlled his senses, and practised\nS\xc2\x92amyama and deep concentration and knew everything of the past, the present\nand the future. He conquered all the enemies and performed various sacrifices\nand became the Emperor of the sea-girt earth and acquired the very rare\nfaculty in the knowledge of everything of his previous births. The Munis came\nto know of this from various rumours and came to the King. The King\nVrihadratha duly entertained those guests. The Munis took their seats and\nasked :-- \xc2\x93O King! We hear that all the events of previous births are vividly\nreflected in your memory. On this point great doubts have come upon us. Kindly\ndescribe in detail. By what Pu _n_ yam (merits) you have come to know all\nabout previous births and the knowledge of the past, the present and the\nfuture. We have come to you to know how you got this wonderful supersensual\nknowledge. Kindly say to us sincerely everything about this and oblige.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n60-71. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Brahma _n_! The very religious King Vrihadratha\nheard them and began to speak out all the secret causes for his knowledge of\nthe past, the present and the future, thus :-- O Munis! Hear how I acquired\nthis knowledge. In my previous birth I was a very low bird chakravak. Once,\nout of my ignorance, I circumambulated round the temple of the Devi Bhagavati\nAnnapur _n_ a at Kas\xc2\x92i. And, as the result of that, I lived in the Heavens for\na period of two Kalpas and I have got this birth and I have got the knowledge\nof the past, the present and the future. O You of good vows! Who can ascertain\nwhat amount of merits accrues from remembering the Feet of the World-Mother.\nRemembering Her glories, I always shed tears of joy. Those who do not worship\nthe adorable Deity Jagadamba are the Great Sinners and they are treacherous.\nFie on their births! The worship of S\xc2\x92iva or Vi _sn_ u is not eternal. Only\nthe Jagadamba\xc2\x92s worship is eternal. Thus it is stated in the S\xc2\x92rutis. What\nmore shall I speak on this worship of the World-Mother, which is void of the\nbest trace of any doubt. Everyone ought to serve devotedly the lotus feet of\nthe Devi Bhagavati. There is no other act more glorious in this world than\nserving the feet of Jagadamba. It is highly necessary to serve the Highest\nDeity, whether in Her Sagu _n_ a or in Her Nirgu _n_ a aspect. (Eat the\nsugarcandy, holding it in any way. It makes no difference.) Naraya _n_ a said\n:-- Hearing the aforesaid words of the virtuous Rajar _s_ i Vrihadratha, the\nMunis went back to their respective abodes. Such is the power of the Devi\nJagadambika! So who can question about the certainty of the high merits\narising from the Jagadambika\xc2\x92s worship and who will not reply, when so\nquestioned? Their births are really fruitful who possess faith in the Devi\nworship;\n\n\n\np. 1114\n\n\n\nbut of those who have no such faith, there is some wrong mixture, no doubt; in\ntheir births.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighteenth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the Greatness of the\nDevi Puja, in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 19](bk11ch19.htm)\n\n'
