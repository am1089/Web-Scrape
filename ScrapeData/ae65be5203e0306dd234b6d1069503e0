The Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n18\\. Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81a. "That which has declared, in twelve thousand two\nhundred verses, the magnificence of the egg of Brahma, and in which an account\nof the future Kalpas is contained, is called the Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81a, and was\nrevealed by Brahma 80."\n\nThe Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81a is usually considered to be in much the same\npredicament as the Skanda, no longer procurable in a collective body, but\nrepresented by a variety of Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as and Mahatmyas, professing to be derived\nfrom it. The facility with which any tract may be thus attached to the non-\nexistent original, and the advantage that has been taken of its absence to\ncompile a variety of unauthentic fragments, have given to the Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a,\nSkanda, and Padma, according to Col. Wilford, the character of being the\nPuran\xcc\x81as of thieves or impostors 81. This is not applicable to the Padma,\nwhich, as above shewn, occurs entire and the same in various parts of India.\nThe imposition of which the other two are made the vehicles can deceive no\none, as the purpose of the particular legend is always too obvious to leave\nany doubt of its origin.\n\nCopies of what profess to be the entire Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81a are sometimes,\nthough rarely, procurable. I met with one in two portions, the former\ncontaining, one hundred and twenty-four chapters, the latter seventy-eight;\nand the whole containing about the number of stanzas assigned to the Puran\xcc\x81a.\nThe first and largest portion, however, proved to be the same as the Vayu\nPuran\xcc\x81a, with a passage occasionally slightly varied, and at the end of each\nchapter the common phrase \'Iti Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a Puran\xcc\x81e\' substituted for \'Iti Vayu\nPuran\xcc\x81e.\' I do not think there was any intended fraud in the substitution. The\nlast section of the first part of the Vayu Puran\xcc\x81a is termed the Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a\nsection, giving an\n\np. lv\n\naccount of the dissolution of the universe; and a careless or ignorant\ntranscriber might have taken this for the title of the whole. The checks to\nthe identity of the work have been honestly preserved, both in the index and\nthe frequent specification of Vayu as the teacher or narrator of it.\n\nThe second portion of this Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a is not any part of the Vayu; it is\nprobably current in the Dakhin as a Sanhita or Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a. Agastya is\nrepresented as going to the city Kanchi (Conjeveram), where Vishn\xcc\x81u, as\nHayagriva, appears to him, and, in answer to his inquiries, imparts to him the\nmeans of salvation, the worship of Para\xc5\x9bakti. In illustration of the efficacy\nof this form of adoration, the main subject of the work is an account of the\nexploits of Lalita Devi, a form of Durga, and her destruction of the demon\nBhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81asura. Rules for her worship are also given, which are decidedly of a\n\xc5\x9aakta or Tantrika description; and this work cannot be admitted, therefore, to\nbe part of a genuine Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[liv:80](vp022.htm#fr_79) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_05400.jpg)\n\n[liv:81](vp022.htm#fr_80) As.
