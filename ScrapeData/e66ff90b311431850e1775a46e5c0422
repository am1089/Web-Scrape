Narada said :-- O All knowing One! Thou showest Thy grace to Thy devotees!\nThou hast described this sin-destroying Gayatri Hridaya. Now describe Her\nStava (hymn of praise).\n\n\n\n2-29. Narayana said :-- O World-Mother! O Thou, favouring Thy devotees! O\nThou, the Prime Force, O Omnipresent! Infinite! S\xc2\x92ri Sandhye! I bow down to\nThee. Thou art the Sandhya; Thou art the Gayatri, Savitri and Sarasvati; Thou\nart Brahmi, Vai _sn_ avi and Raudri and Thou art red, white, and black (the\ncolours of Gayatri, Savitri and Sarasvati) that Thou assumest respectively. O\nBhagavati! Thou art always meditated by the Munis as young in the morning,\nfull of youth in the mid-day, and aged in the evening. I bow down to Thee.\nThou art seen by the Tapasvis (ascetics) as Brahmani, riding on Hamsa (swan),\nSarasvati riding on Garu _d_ a, and Savitri riding on Bull. Thou art seen\nwithin by the ascetics as manifesting the Rigveda (in the form of Savitri) in\nthis world, as manifesting Yayurveda in the middle space (antarik _s_ am) and\nas manifesting Samaveda everywhere in the Rudra loka, thus roaming in the\nthree worlds. I bow down to Thee. O Devi! Thou art Rudrani in the Rudra loka,\nVai _sn_ avi in the Vi _sn_ u loka, and Brahmani in the Brahma loka; thus Thou\nshewest Thy favour to the Immortals. O Devi! Thou art the Mother delighting\nthe seven Ri _s_ is (of the Great Bear); Thou art Maya. Thou grantest great\nmany boons to Thy Bhaktas. Thou art sprung from the eyes and hands, tears and\nperspiration of S\xc2\x92iva and S\xc2\x92iva. Thou art the Mother of delights, Durga Devi,\nrecited by the following ten names :-- Vare _n_ ya, Varada, Vari _st_ ha,\nVaravarni _n_ i, Gari _st_ ha, Varaha, Vararoha, Nilaganga, Sandhya and Bhoga\nMok _s_ ada. Thou art the Bhagirathi (the river Ganges) in this world; the\nBhogavati in the Patala; and the Mandakini (the milky way) in the Heavens.\nThou art in this world (Bhur loka) the all-enduring Prithvi (earth); Thou art\nthe Vayu S\xc2\x92akti (air power) in the middle space (Bhubhar Loka); Thou art the\nenergy (the ocean of Tejas) in the Heavens (Svar loka); Thou art the Great\nSiddhi in the Mahar loka; Thou art Jana in the Janar Loka; Thou art Tapasvini\nin the Tapar loka; Thou art Truth (True Speech) in the Satya lokam. Thou art\nKamala in Vi _sn_ u loka; Gayatri in Brahma loka; and the other half of Hara\nas Gauri in the Rudra loka. O Devi! Thou art sung as Prakriti \xc2\x96 \xc2\x93Aham\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Om-\nMahat\xc2\x94 tattva and beyond that the Highest Sarva\n\n\n\np. 1146\n\n\n\nBrahma rupi _n_ i and Samyavastha Prakriti. Thou art the Para S\xc2\x92akti; Thou art\nthe Parama S\xc2\x92akti; O Devi! Thou art the Tri-S\xc2\x92akti :-- the Ichchha S\xc2\x92akti (the\nwill power), the Kriya S\xc2\x92akti (power of action) and the J\xc3\xb1ana S\xc2\x92akti (the\nforce of knowledge). Thou art the Ganga, Yamuna, Vipas'a, Sarasvati, Sarayu,\nDevika, Sindhu; Narmada, \xc3\x8eravati, Godavari, S\xc2\x92atadru; Kaveri, Kaus'iki,\nChandra Bhaga, Vitasta, Ga _nd_ aki, Tapini, Karatoya, Gomati, and Vetravati\nand other rivers; Thou art the I _d_ a, Pingala, and Su _s_ umna nerves; Thou\nart Gandhari, Hastajihva, Pu _s_ a, Apu _s_ a, Alambusa, Kuhu, S\xc2\x92ankhini,\nPranavahini and other nerves in the body; O Devi! Thou art the vital power in\nthe lotus of the heart; Thou art Svapna naika in the throat; Thou art\nSadadhara in the palate; and Thou art the Vindumalini S\xc2\x92akti in the pituitary\nspace between the eyebrows.\n\n\n\nThou art the Ku _nd_ alini in the Muladhara (sacral plexus), the Vyapini\nextending upto the roots of the hairs; Thou art Madhyasana on the crown of the\nhead, and Thou art Manonmani in the Brahmarandhra. O Devi! What need there is\nin stating these? Suffice it to say that whatever there is seen in this\nuniverse, all art Thou; therefore, O S\xc2\x92ri Sandhya Devi! I bow down to Thee. O\nNarada! Thus I have spoken to you about the Gayatri-Stotra that gives all\nsuccesses, destroys all sins, and yields all merits. He who reads this in the\nSandhya times, with all attention, will get sons if he has no sons, will get\nwealth if he has no wealth. There is no doubt in this. Whoever reads this\nStotra gets the fruits of all Tirthas, all Tapasyas, all gifts, all sacrifices\nand all Yogas. He enjoys happiness in this world and finally gets the Mok _s_\na. The Munis who are engaged in Tapasyas read this Stotra. While bathing, if\none reads this, merged under water, acquires the fruits of his being merged in\nthe Sandhya. O Narada! I speak this verily, verily, verily, unto you that\nthere is no trace of any doubt in this statement. Whoever will hear with\ndevotion this Sandhya stotra, the nectar-like thing, will be freed from all\nsins.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifth Chapter of the Twelfth Book on the Gayatri Stotra in the\nMahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 6](bk12ch06.htm)\n\n"
