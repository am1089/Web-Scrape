In the midst\nof the chamber the harp of joy is gently and sweetly played; and where is the\nneed of going without to hear it?  \nIf you have not drunk of the nectar of that One Love, what boots it though you\nshould purge yourself of all stains?  \nThe Kazi is searching the words of the Koran, and instructing others: p. 100\nbut if his heart be not steeped in that love, what does it avail, though he be\na teacher of men?  \nThe Yogi dyes his garments with red: but if he knows naught of that colour of\nlove, what does it avail though his garments be tinted?  \nKabir says: "Whether I be in the temple or the balcony, in the camp or in the\nflower garden, I tell you truly that every moment my Lord is taking His\ndelight in me."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: LV](sok056.htm)\n\n'
