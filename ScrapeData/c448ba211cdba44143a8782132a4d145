(The soul is) a part, on account of the declarations of difference and\notherwise; some also record\n\np. 559\n\n[paragraph continues] (that Brahman is of) the nature of slaves, fishermen,\nand so on.\n\nThe Sutras have declared that the individual soul is an agent, and as such\ndependent on the highest Person. The following question now arises--Is the\nindividual soul absolutely different from Brahman? or is it nothing else than\nBrahman itself in so far as under the influence of error? or is it Brahman in\nso far as determined by a limiting adjunct (upadhi)? or is it a part (a _m_\nsa) of Brahman?--The doubt on this point is due to the disagreement of the\nscriptural texts.--But this whole matter has already been decided under Su.\nII, 1, 22.--True. But as a difficulty presents itself on the ground of the\nconflicting nature of the texts--some asserting the difference and some the\nunity of the individual soul and Brahman--the matter is here more specially\ndecided by its being proved that the soul is a part of Brahman. As long as\nthis decision remains unsettled, the conclusions arrived at under the two\nSutras referred to, viz. that the soul is non-different from Brahman and that\nBrahman is 'additional' to the soul, are without a proper basis.\n\nLet it then first be said that the soul is absolutely different from Brahman,\nsince texts such as 'There are two, the one knowing, the other not knowing,\nboth unborn, the one strong, the other weak' ( _S_ vet. Up. I, 9) declare\ntheir difference. Texts which maintain the non-difference of a being which is\nknowing and another which is not knowing, if taken literally, convey a\ncontradiction--as if one were to say, 'Water the ground with fire'!-and must\ntherefore be understood in some secondary metaphorical sense. To hold that the\nindividual soul is a part of Brahman does not explain matters; for by a 'part'\nwe understand that which constitutes part of the extension of something. If,\nthen, the soul occupied part of the extension of Brahman, all its\nimperfections would belong to Brahman. Nor can the soul be a part of Brahman\nif we take 'part' to mean a _piece_ (kha _nd_ a); for Brahman does not admit\nof being divided into pieces, and moreover, the difficulties\n\np. 560\n\nconnected with the former interpretation would present themselves here also.\nThat something absolutely different from something else should yet be a part\nof the latter cannot in fact be proved.\n\nOr else let it be said that the soul is Brahman affected by error (bhrama).\nFor this is the teaching of texts such as 'Thou art that'; 'this Self is\nBrahman.' Those texts, on the other hand, which declare the difference of the\ntwo merely restate what is already established by perception and the other\nmeans of knowledge, and therefore are shown, by those texts the purport of\nwhich it is to teach non-duality not established by other means, to lie--like\nperception and the other means of knowledge themselves--within the sphere of\nNescience.\n\nOr let it be assumed, in the third place, that the individual soul is Brahman\nas determined by a beginningless limiting adjunct (upadhi). For it is on this\nground that Scripture teaches the Self to be Brahman. And that upadhi must not\nbe said to be a mere erroneous imagination, for on that view the distinction\nof bondage, release, and so on, would be impossible.\n\nAgainst all these views the Sutra declares that the soul is a part of Brahman;\nsince there are declarations of difference and also 'otherwise,' i.e.\ndeclarations of unity. To the former class belong all those texts which dwell\non the distinction of the creator and the creature, the ruler and the ruled,\nthe all-knowing and the ignorant, the independent and the dependent, the pure\nand the impure, that which is endowed with holy qualities and that which\npossesses qualities of an opposite kind, the lord and the dependent. To the\nlatter class belong such texts as 'Thou art that' and 'this Self is Brahman.'\nSome persons even record that Brahman is of the nature of slaves, fishermen,\nand so on. The \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas, that is to say, have the following text,'\nBrahman are the slaves. Brahman are these fishers,' and so on; and as Brahman\nthere is said to comprise within itself all individual souls, the passage\nteaches general non-difference of the Self. In order, then, that texts of both\nthese classes may be taken in their\n\np. 561\n\nprimary, literal sense, we must admit that the individual soul is a part of\nBrahman. Nor is it a fact that the declarations of difference refer to matters\nsettled by other means of knowledge, such as perception and so on, and on that\naccount are mere reiterations of something established otherwise (in\nconsequence of which they would have no original proving force of their own,\nand would be sublated by the texts declaring non-duality). For the fact that\nthe soul is created by Brahman, is ruled by it, constitutes its body, is\nsubordinate to it, abides in it, is preserved by it, is absorbed by it, stands\nto it in the relation of a meditating devotee, and through its grace attains\nthe different ends of man, viz. religious duty, wealth, pleasure and final\nrelease--all this and what is effected thereby, viz. the distinction of the\nsoul and Brahman, does not fall within the cognisance of perception and the\nother means of proof, and hence is not established by something else. It is\ntherefore not true that the texts declaring the creation of the world, and so\non, are mere reiterations of differences established by other means of\nauthoritative knowledge, and hence have for their purport to teach things that\nare false.--[Nor will it do to say that the texts declaring duality teach what\nindeed is not established by other means of knowledge but is erroneous.]\n'Brahman conceives the thought of differentiating itself, forms the resolution\nof becoming many, and accordingly creates the ether and the other elements,\nenters into them as individual soul, evolves all the different forms and\nnames, takes upon himself all the pleasures and pains which spring from\nexperiencing the infinite multitude of objects thus constituted, abides within\nand inwardly rules all beings, recognises itself in its _g_ iva-condition to\nbe one with the universal causal Brahman, and finally accomplishes its release\nfrom the sa _m_ sara and the body of sacred doctrine by which this release is\neffected'--all this the Veda indeed declares, but its real purport is that ail\nthis is only true of a Brahman under the influence of an illusion,and\ntherefore is unreal!--while at the same time Brahman is defined as that the\nessential nature of which is absolutely pure intelligence! Truly, if such were\nthe purport of the Veda, what\n\np. 562\n\nmore would the Veda be than the idle talk of a person out of his mind!\n\nNor finally is there any good in the theory of the soul being Brahman in so\nfar as determined by a limiting adjunct. For this view also is in conflict\nwith the texts which distinguish Brahman as the ruling and the soul as the\nruled principle, and so on. One and the same Devadatta does not become double\nas it were--a ruler on the one hand and a ruled subject on the other--because\nhe is determined by the house in which he is, or by something else.\n\nIn order to be able to account for the twofold designations of the soul, we\nmust therefore admit that the soul is a _part_ of Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 43.
