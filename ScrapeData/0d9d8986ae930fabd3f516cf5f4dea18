He who performs his bounden duty without leaning to the fruit of action\n--he is a renouncer of action as well as of steadfast mind: not he who is\nwithout fire, nor he who is without action. 1\n\np. 138\n\n2\\. Know that to be devotion to action, which is called renunciation, O\nPandava, for none becomes a devotee to action without forsaking Sankalpa. 2\n\np. 139\n\n3\\. For the man of meditation wishing to attain purification of heart leading\nto concentration, work is said to be the way: For him, when he has attained\nsuch (concentration), inaction is said to be the way. 3\n\n4\\. Verily, when there is no attachment, either to sense-objects, or to\nactions, having renounced all Sankalpas, then is one said to have attained\nconcentration. 4\n\np. 140\n\n5\\. A man should uplift himself by his own self, so let him not weaken this\nself. For this self is the friend of oneself, and this self is the enemy of\noneself. 5\n\np. 141\n\n6\\. The self (the active part of our nature) is the friend of the self, for\nhim who has conquered himself by this self. But to the unconquered self, this\nself is inimical, (and behaves) like (an external) foe. 6\n\n7\\. To the self-controlled and serene, the Supreme Self is, the object of\nconstant, realisation, in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as well as in\nhonour and dishonour. 7\n\np. 142\n\n8\\. Whose heart is filled with satisfaction by wisdom and realisation, and is\nchangeless, whose senses are conquered, and to whom a lump of earth, stone,\nand gold are the same: that Yogi is called steadfast. 8\n\np. 143\n\n9\\. He attains excellence who looks with equal regard upon well-wishers,\nfriends, foes, neutrals, arbiters, the hateful, the relatives, and upon the\nrighteous and the unrighteous alike.\n\n10\\. The Yogi should constantly practise concentration of the heart, retiring\ninto solitude, alone, with the mind and body subdued, and free from hope and\npossession.\n\n11\\. Having in a cleanly spot established his seat, firm, neither too high nor\n\np. 144\n\ntoo low, made of a cloth, a skin, and Kusha-grass, arranged in consecution: 11\n\n12\\. There, seated on that seat, making the mind one-pointed and subduing the\naction of the imaging faculty and the senses, let him practise Yoga for the\npurification of the heart.\n\n13\\. Let him firmly hold his body, head and neck erect and still, (with the\neye-balls fixed, as if) gazing at the tip of his nose, and not looking around.\n13\n\np. 145\n\n14\\. With the heart serene and fearless, firm in the vow of a Brahmachari,\nwith the mind controlled, and ever thinking of Me, let him sit (in Yoga)\nhaving Me as his supreme goal.\n\n15\\. Thus always keeping the mind steadfast, the Yogi of subdued mind attains\nthe peace residing in Me,--the\n\np. 146\n\npeace which culminates in Nirvana (Moksha).\n\n16\\. (Success in) Yoga is not for him who eats too much or too little--nor, O\nArjuna, for him who sleeps too much or too little. 16\n\n17\\. To him who is temperate in eating and recreation, in his effort for work,\n\np. 147\n\nand in sleep and wakefulness, Yoga becomes the destroyer of misery.\n\n18\\. When the completely controlled mind rests serenely in the Self alone,\nfree from longing after all desires, then is one called steadfast, (in the\nSelf).\n\n19\\. "As a lamp in a spot sheltered from the wind does not flicker,"--even\nsuch has been the simile used for a Yogi of subdued mind, practising\nconcentration in the Self.\n\np. 148 p. 149\n\n20-23. When the mind, absolutely restrained by the practice of concentration,\nattains quietude, and when seeing the Self by the self, one is satisfied in\nhis own Self; when he feels that infinite bliss--which is perceived by the\n(purified) intellect and which transcends the senses, and established wherein\nhe never departs from his real state; and having obtained which, regards no\nother acquisition superior to that, and where established, he is not moved\neven by heavy sorrow;--let that be known as the state, called by the name of\nYoga,--a state of severance from the contact of pain. This Yoga should be\npractised with perseverance, undisturbed by depression of heart. 20\n\np. 150\n\n24\\. Abandoning without reserve all desires born of Sankalpa, and completely\nrestraining, by the mind alone, the whole group of senses from their objects\nin all directions;\n\n25\\. With the intellect set in patience, with the mind fastened on the Self,\nlet him attain quietude by degrees: let him not think of anything.\n\n26\\. Through whatever reason the\n\np. 151\n\nrestless, unsteady mind wanders away, let him curbing it from that, bring it\nunder the subjugation of the Self alone.\n\n27\\. Verily, the supreme bliss comes to that Yogi, of perfectly tranquil mind,\nwith passions quieted, Brahman-become, and freed from taint. 27\n\n28\\. The Yogi freed from taint (of good and evil), constantly engaging the\nmind thus, with ease attains the infinite bliss of contact with Brahman.\n\np. 152\n\n29\\. With the heart concentrated by Yoga, with the eye of evenness for all\nthings, he beholds the Self in all beings and all beings in the Self.\n\n30\\. He who sees Me in all things, and sees all things in Me, he never becomes\nseparated from Me, nor do I become separated from him. 30\n\np. 153\n\n31\\. He who being established in unity, worships Me, who am dwelling in all\nbeings, whatever his mode of life, that Yogi abides in Me. 31\n\n32\\. He who judges of pleasure or pain everywhere, by the same standard as he\napplies to himself, that Yogi, O Arjuna, is regarded as the highest. 32\n\np. 154\n\nArjuna said:\n\n33\\. This Yoga which has been taught by Thee, O slayer of Madhu, as\ncharacterised by evenness, I do not see (the possibility of) its lasting\nendurance, owing to restlessness (of the mind).\n\n34\\. Verily, the mind, O Krishna, is restless, turbulent, strong, and\nunyielding;. I regard it quite as hard to achieve its control, as that of the\nwind. 34\n\np. 155\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n35\\. Without doubt, O mighty-armed, the mind is restless, and difficult to\ncontrol; but through practice and renunciation, O son of Kunti, it may be\ngoverned. 35\n\np. 156\n\n36\\. Yoga is hard to be attained by one of uncontrolled self: such is My\nconviction; but the self-controlled, striving by right means, can obtain it.\n\nArjuna said:\n\n37\\. Though possessed of Shraddha but unable to control himself, with the mind\nwandering away from Yoga, what end does one, failing to gain perfection in\nYoga, meet, O Krishna?\n\np. 157\n\n38\\. Does he not, fallen from both, perish, without support, like a rent\ncloud, O mighty-armed, deluded in the path of Brahman? 38\n\n39\\. This doubt of mine, O Krishna, Thou shouldst completely dispel; for it is\nnot possible for any but Thee to dispel this doubt. 39\n\np. 158\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n40\\. Verily, O son of Pritha, there is destruction for him, neither here nor\nhereafter: for, the doer of good, O my son, never comes to grief. 40\n\n41\\. Having attained to the worlds of the righteous, and dwelling there for\neverlasting years, one fallen from Yoga reincarnates in the home of the pure\nand the prosperous. 41\n\np. 159\n\n42\\. Or else he is born into a family of wise Yogis only; verily, a birth such\nas that is very rare to obtain in this world. 42\n\n43\\. There he is united with the intelligence acquired in his former body, and\nstrives more than before, for perfection, O son of the Kurus. 43\n\np. 160\n\n44\\. By that previous practice alone, he is borne on in spite of himself. Even\nthe enquirer after Yoga rises superior to the performer of Vedic actions. 44\n\np. 161\n\n45\\. The Yogi, striving assiduously, purified of taint, gradually gaining\nperfection through many births, then reaches the highest goal.\n\n46\\. The Yogi is regarded as superior to those who practise asceticism, also\nto those who have obtained wisdom (through the Shastras). He is also superior\nto the performers of action, (enjoined in the Vedas). Therefore, be thou a\nYogi, O Arjuna! 46\n\np. 162\n\n47\\. And of all Yogis, he who with the inner self merged in Me, with Shraddha\ndevotes himself to Me, is considered by Me the most steadfast. 47\n\n\n\nThe end of the sixth chapter, designated The Way of Meditation.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[137:1](sbg11.htm#fr_134) _Bounden duty:_ Nityakarma.\n\n_Renouncer of action as well as of steadfast mind:_ Sannyasi and Yogi.\n\n_Without fire:_ He that has renounced actions enjoined by the Vedas, requiring\nfire as adjunct, _e.g._ , Agnihotra. p. 138\n\n_Without action:_ He who has renounced actions which do not require fire as\nadjunct, such as austerities and meritorious acts like digging wells etc.\n\n[138:2](sbg11.htm#fr_135) _Sankalpa_ --is the working of the imaging faculty,\nforming fancies, making plans and again brushing them aside, conceiving future\nresults, starting afresh on a new line, leading to different issues, and so on\nand so forth. No one can be a Karma-Yogin or a devotee to action, who makes\nplans and wishes for the fruit of action.\n\n[139:3](sbg11.htm#fr_136) _Purification of the heart leading to concentration_\n--Yoga. "For a Brahmana there is no wealth like unto (the eye of) one-ness,\n(and) even-ness, trueness, refinement, steadiness, harmlessness,\nstraightforwardness, and gradual withdrawal from all action."--Mahabharata,\nShanti Parva. 175, 88.\n\n[139:4](sbg11.htm#fr_137) _Attained concentration:_ Yogarudha.\n\n_Renouncer of all Sankalpas:_ "O desire, I know where thy root lies: thou art\nborn of Sankalpa. I p. 140 shall not think of thee, and thou shalt cease to\nexist, together with thy root." Mahabharata. Shanti Parva. 177, 25.\n\n[140:5](sbg11.htm#fr_138) The self-conscious nature of man is here considered\nin two aspects as being both the object of spiritual uplift and the subject of\nspiritual uplift, the ego acted upon and the ego acting upon the former. This\nlatter active principle or ego should be kept strong in its uplifting\nfunction, for it. is apt to turn an enemy, if it is not a friend, and the next\nverse explains the reason.\n\n[141:6](sbg11.htm#fr_139) The self is the friend of one, in whom the aggregate\nof the body and the senses has been brought under control, and an enemy when\nsuch in not the case.\n\n[141:7](sbg11.htm#fr_140) Hence he remains unruffled in pleasant and adverse\nenvironments.\n\n[142:8](sbg11.htm#fr_141) _Wisdom_ --Jnana: knowledge of Shastras.\n_Realisation_ --Vijnana: one\'s own experience of the teachings of Shastras.\n\n_Changeless_ --like the anvil. Things are hammered and shaped on the anvil,\nbut the anvil remains unchanged: in the same manner he is called Kutastha--\nwhose heart remains unchanged though objects are present.\n\n[144:11](sbg11.htm#fr_142) _Arranged in consecution:_ that is,--the Kusha-\ngrass arranged on the ground; above that, a tiger or deer skin, covered by a\ncloth.\n\n[144:13](sbg11.htm#fr_143) _Gazing at the tip of his nose_ ,--could not be-\nliterally meant here, because then the mind would be fixed only there, and not\non the Self: when the eyes are half-closed in meditation, and the eye-balls\nare still, the gaze is directed, _as it were_ , on the tip of the nose.\n\n[146:16](sbg11.htm#fr_144) The Yoga-shastra prescribes: "Half (the stomach)\nfor food and condiments, the third (quarter) for water, and the fourth should\nbe reserved for free motion of air."\n\n[149:20](sbg11.htm#fr_145) _Which is perceived . . . intellect:_ Which the\npurified intellect can grasp independently of the senses. When in meditation\nthe mind is deeply concentrated, the senses do not function and are resolved\ninto their cause,--that is, the mind; and when the latter is steady, so that\nthere is only the intellect functioning, or in other words, cognition only\nexists, the indescribable Self is realised.\n\n[151:27](sbg11.htm#fr_146) _Brahman-become_ , _i.e._ , one who has realised\nthat all is Brahman.\n\n_Taint_ --of good and evil.\n\n[152:30](sbg11.htm#fr_147) _Separated_ , _i.e._ , by time, space, or anything\nintervening.\n\n[153:31](sbg11.htm#fr_148) _Worships Me:_ realises Me as the Self of all.\n\n_Established in unity_ , _i.e._ , having resolved all duality in the\nunderlying unity.\n\n[153:32](sbg11.htm#fr_149) Seeing that whatever is pleasure or pain to,\nhimself, is alike pleasure or pain to all beings, he, the highest of Yogins,\nwishes good to all and evil to none,--he is always harmless and compassionate\nto all creatures.\n\n[154:34](sbg11.htm#fr_150) p. 155 \' _Krishna_ ,\' is derived from \'Krish,\' to\nscrape: Krishna is so called, because He scrapes or draws away all sins and\nother evils from His devotees.\n\n[155:35](sbg11.htm#fr_151) Cf. Patanjali I. 12.\n\n_Practice:_ Earnest and repeated attempt to make the mind steady in its\nunmodified state of Pure Intelligence, by means of constant meditation upon\nthe chosen Ideal.\n\n_Renunciation:_ Freedom from desire for any pleasures, seen or unseen,\nachieved by a constant perception of evil in them.\n\n[157:38](sbg11.htm#fr_152) _Fallen from both:_ That is, from both the paths of\nknowledge and action.\n\n[157:39](sbg11.htm#fr_153) Since there can be no better teacher than the\nOmniscient Lord.\n\n[158:40](sbg11.htm#fr_154) _T ata_--son. A disciple is looked upon as a son;\nArjuna is thus addressed having placed himself in the position of a disciple\nto Krishna.\n\n[158:41](sbg11.htm#fr_155) _Everlasting years_ --not absolutely, meaning a\nvery long period.\n\n[159:42](sbg11.htm#fr_156) _Very rare:_ more difficult than the one mentioned\nin the preceding Sloka.\n\n[159:43](sbg11.htm#fr_157) _Intelligence_ --Samskara: Store of experience in\nthe shape of impressions and habits.\n\n_Strives . . . perfection:_ Strives more strenuously to attain to higher\nplanes of realisation than those acquired in his former birth.\n\n[160:44](sbg11.htm#fr_158) _Borne on in spite of himself:_ carried to the goal\nof the course which he marked out for himself in his last incarnation, by the\nforce of his former Samskaras, though he might be unconscious of them--or even\nunwilling to pursue it, owing to the interference of some untoward Karma.\n\n_Rises &c.:_ lit. goes beyond the Word-Brahman, _i.e._ , the Vedas.\n\n[161:46](sbg11.htm#fr_159) _Wisdom:_ Knowledge from precepts, but not direct\ninsight into the Divine Truth.\n\n[162:47](sbg11.htm#fr_160) _Of all Yogis &c.:_--of all Yogis he who devotes\nhimself to the All-pervading Infinite, is superior to those who devote\nthemselves to the lesser ideals, or gods, such as Vasu, Rudra, Aditya, etc.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Seventh Chapter.
