Verily, imperishable is the righteousness of him that offers the\nSeasonal sacrifices; for such a one gains the year, and hence there is no\ncessation for him. He gains it (the year) in three divisions, he conquers it\nin three divisions. The year means the whole, and the whole is imperishable\n(without end): hence his righteousness is indeed imperishable. Moreover, he\nthereby becomes a Season, and as such goes to the gods; but there is no\nperishableness in the gods, and hence there is imperishable righteousness for\nhim. This, then, is why he offers the Seasonal sacrifices.\n\n2:6:3:22\\. Then as to why he should perform the _S_ unasirya offering. The\nprosperity ( _s_ ri) that accrued to the gods on performing the Sakamedha\nofferings, and gaining the victory (over V _ri_ tra), is _s_ una; and the\nessence (rasa) that belonged to the year gained by them is sira 2. Now that\nsame prosperity which\n\np. 445\n\naccrued to the gods on performing the Sakamedha offerings, and that same\nessence which belonged to the year gained by them,--both these he takes\npossession of and makes his own: that is why he performs the _S_ unasirya.\n\n2:6:3:33\\. The mode of its performance (is as follows): They prepare no\nuttaravedi; they do not use clotted butter; nor do they churn the fire 1.\nThere are five fore-offerings, three after-offerings, and one Samish _t_ aya\n_g_ us.\n\n2:6:3:44\\. Then, in the first place, there are those five (regular) oblations\n2. By means of these oblations, indeed, Pra _g_ apati produced creatures; with\nthem he delivered the creatures both ways from Varu _n_ a's noose; with them\nthe gods slew V _ri_ tra and gained that victory which was gained by them. And\nso does he, by means of them, obtain and make his own, both that prosperity\nwhich accrued to the gods from performing the Sakamedha offerings, and that\nessence of the year which was gained by them. This is why those five oblations\nare (offered).\n\n2:6:3:55\\. Then follows a _S_ unasirya 3 cake on twelve\n\np. 446\n\npotsherds. The import of this _S_ unasirya oblation is what we have stated\nbefore.\n\n2:6:3:66\\. After that there is an (oblation of) milk 1 to Vayu. Now it is to\nmilk that living beings readily take, when they are born: 'May the creatures\nreadily take to me--now that I have gained the victory (by means of the\nSakamedha offerings)--for my prosperity, glory, and support!' so he thinks,\nand hence that (oblation of) milk.\n\n2:6:3:77\\. Then as to why it is (offered) to Vayu. Now Vayu, indeed, is yonder\nblowing (wind); it is he that makes swell whatever rain falls here. But it is\nby the rain that plants grow; and on the plants being eaten and the water\ndrunk, milk is produced out of that water. Hence it is he (Vayu) that produces\nit; and for this reason it is (offered) to Vayu.\n\n2:6:3:88\\. Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Surya. Now Surya, indeed,\nis yonder scorching (sun); it is he that governs all this (world), now by\nmeans of a good, now by a bad (king) 2; he assigns its place to everything\nhere, now under a good, now under a bad (king): 'Now that I have obtained the\nvictory, may he, in his pleasure, govern me through a good (king), may he\nassign to me a place under a good (king)!' thus he thinks; and for this reason\nthere is a cake on one potsherd for Surya.\n\n2:6:3:99\\. The priests' fee for this (oblation to Surya)\n\np. 447\n\nis a white horse 1; whereby it is made of the characteristic form of yonder\nscorching (sun). If he be unable to procure a white horse, it may be a white\nbull; whereby it is likewise made of the characteristic form of yonder\nscorching (sun).\n\n2:6:3:1010\\. He may offer the _S_ unasirya at the same time when he performs\nthe Sakamedha offerings. By offering (Seasonal sacrifices) three times in the\nyear, he indeed obtains the (whole) year: he may therefore offer (the _S_\nunasirya) at any time 2.\n\n2:6:3:1111\\. Here now some wish to take possession of the nights; and should\nhe wish to take possession of the nights, let him offer the _S_ unasirya (on\nthe day) when, previously to the full-moon of Phalguna, (the new moon) becomes\nvisible in yonder sky.\n\n2:6:3:1212\\. Let him then get consecrated (for the Soma-sacrifice), lest the\nPhalguna full-moon again pass by without his offering (Soma). For were the\nPhalguna full-moon again to pass by without his having\n\np. 448\n\noffered (Soma), he would certainly have to begin anew (to perform the Seasonal\nofferings): hence the Phalguna full-moon should not again pass by without his\noffering Soma. Such (is the rule) for him who discontinues (the Seasonal\nofferings).\n\n2:6:3:1313\\. And in the case of one who recommences (the Seasonal offerings),\n--let him perform the _S_ unasirya on the day preceding the Phalguna full-\nmoon, and on the following day the Vai _s_ vadeva, and after that the Full-\nmoon offering. This, then, (is the rule) for him who recommences (the Seasonal\nofferings).\n\n2:6:3:1414\\. Then as to (the Sacrificer) shaving his head all round 1. Now\nyonder sun, indeed, faces every quarter; it drinks up whatever (moisture) it\ndries up here: hence this (Sacrificer) thereby faces every quarter and becomes\na consumer of food.\n\n2:6:3:1515\\. This fire also faces every quarter, since it burns all they put\ninto it from whatsoever quarter: hence this (Sacrificer) thereby faces every\nquarter and becomes a consumer of food.\n\n2:6:3:1616\\. This man, on the other hand, faces but one quarter; but by\nshaving his head all round he comes to face every quarter; and whosoever,\nknowing this, has his head shaved all round, becomes just such a consumer of\nfood as those two: let him therefore have his head shaved all round.\n\n2:6:3:1717\\. And on this point \xc3\x82suri said, 'What in the world has it to do\nwith his face, even if he were to shave off all the hair of his head! It is by\noffering\n\np. 449\n\nthrice in the year that he comes to face all the quarters and becomes a\nconsumer of food: let him therefore not trouble himself about shaving his\nhead.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[444:1](sbe1261.htm#fr_998) See II, 5, 2, 48.\n\n[444:2](sbe1262.htm#fr_999) The author identifies sira (plough) with sara,\n'essence, sap;' and takes _s_ una, ploughshare (?), as identical with _s_\nunam, 'successfully, prosperously.' See next page, note 3.\n\n[445:1](sbe1262.htm#fr_1000) But see XI, 5, 2, 8, 'At all four of these ( _K_\naturmasya offerings) they churn the fire.' On account of this contradiction,\nthe commentators, on Katy. V, 11, 3, consider the churning of the fire as\noptional. But, if the fires were produced by 'churning,' nine fore-offerings\nand after-offerings would have to be performed, as at the other Seasonal\nsacrifices, which is expressly forbidden in the above passage. According to\nKaty. himself, the _S_ unasirya is to be treated like an ordinary ish _t_ i,\nexcept that the barhis is to be tied together in the way prescribed for the\nSeasonal offerings; see II, 5, 1, 18.\n\n[445:2](sbe1262.htm#fr_1001) See II, 5, 1, 8-11.\n\n[445:3](sbe1262.htm#fr_1002) That is, according to Katy. V, II, 5, to _S_ una\nand Sira,--probably the ploughshare and plough, considered as two tutelary\ndeities of agricultural pursuits (Rig-veda IV, 57, 5-8); but by Yaska\nidentified with Vayu and \xc3\x82ditya;--or, according to Taitt. S. I, 8, 7, I, p.\n446 Taitt. Br. I, 7, 1, 1, to Indra _S_ unasira (i.e. Indra, accompanied by\n_S_ una and Sira, Say.).\n\n[446:1](sbe1262.htm#fr_1003) According to Katy. V, II, 6-to, the milk, in this\ncase, is to be offered quite fresh (and warm) from the cow, without having\nbeen put on the fire. Rice-gruel may, however, be offered instead.\n\n[446:2](sbe1262.htm#fr_1004) Or, 'now by good, now by bad (means).'\n\n[447:1](sbe1262.htm#fr_1005) According to Taitt. S. I, 8, 7, Taitt. Br. I, 7,\n1, 2, the Dakshi _n_ a consists of a plough yoked with twelve oxen.\n\n[447:2](sbe1262.htm#fr_1006) That is to say, he may perform the _S_ unasirya,\neither immediately after the Sakamedha _h_ , or at any time within four months\nafter that sacrifice (comm. on Katy. V, 11, 3). Our author, however, evidently\nfavours the views set forth in the succeeding paragraphs. According to these,\nthe householder who wishes to discontinue the Seasonal offerings after the\nfirst round, and to become a Soma-sacrificer, is to perform the _S_ unasirya\non the first day of the waxing moon of Phalguna, and then to undergo the\ndiksha, or rite of consecration for the Soma-sacrifice (see III, 1, 2, 1\nseq.), either immediately or before the approaching full-moon, when he is to\nperform the Agnish _t_ oma (or an animal offering to Agni and Soma or an\n\xc3\x82gneyi ish _t_ i, Katy. V, 11, 15). If, on the other hand, he intends to\ncontinue the _K_ aturmasyas for another year (or more), he is to perform the\n_S_ unasirya on the upavasatha, or day preceding the full-moon.\n\n[448:1](sbe1262.htm#fr_1007) 'Parivartayate' ('nivartayate,' Ka _n_ va), lit.\n'he causes himself to be turned round,' is the technical expression for having\none's head shaved all round (the _s_ ikha, or lock of hair on the crown of the\nhead).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 6, 4.
