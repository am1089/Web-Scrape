Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93Munis! How did the Bhargava wives cross this endless\nsea of troubles and how was the family of Bhrigu re-established on the surface\nof this earth? And what did the greedy Haihayas, the vilest of the K _s_\nattriyas, do after they killed the Bhargavas? Describe all these in detail and\nsatisfy my curiosity. O Thou, Ocean of austerities! I am not satisfied with\nthe drink of your nectar like\n\n\n\np. 542\n\n\n\nwords, very holy and leading to happiness in this world and to good merits in\nthe next.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n4-28. Vyasa said :-- O King! I will now narrate to you the sin destroying\nvirtuous story how the Bhargava wives crossed their great hardships and the\nocean of troubles, very difficult to cross. The Bhargava wives, when they were\nvery much harassed by the Haihayas, went to the Himalayas, overwhelmed with\nterror and disappointment. There on that mountain they erected an earthen\nimage of S\xc2\x92ri Gauri Devi by the banks of the Ganges and worshipped Her and,\nfirmly resolved to die, began to fast. The Devi Jagadambika appeared to those\nreligious women in their dreams and said :-- \xc2\x93A son will be born of My essence\nto one of you from one of her thighs; that son will redress all your wants.\xc2\x94\nThus speaking, the Devi Bhagavati disappeared. Those women when they woke up\nwere very glad; one of them that appeared very clever, becoming very much\nanxious out of the fear of the K _s_ attriyas; preserved the foetus in one of\nher thighs for the propagation of the family. Her body became luminous; she\nthen fled, overwhelmed with terror. The K _s_ attriyas, seeing that Brahma _n_\ni, came quickly upon her and said :-- \xc2\x93See! This pregnant Bhargava wife is\nflying away hastily; seize her and take away her life.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, all of\nthem raised their axes, and pursued her. Then that woman seeing them coming,\nwept out of fear. She cried, out of terror, for the preservation of the child\nin her womb; and the child seeing her mother helpless and distressed,\ntrembling with fear and with tears in her eyes having no one to protect her\nand awfully oppressed by the K _s_ attriyas as if a pregnant deer has been\nattacked by a lion and is crying about, angrily burst out of the thigh of his\nmother, and quickly came out like a second Sun. That good looking boy took\naway the power of sight of those K _s_ attriyas by his brilliant lustrous\nlight; no sooner the Haihayas saw that boy than they got blind. Like those\nthat are born blind; they then began to roam in the caves of mountains and\nthought within themselves, what an evil turn of Fate had overtaken them! They\nthought thus :-- \xc2\x93Oh! The mere sight of that boy has turned us blind; what a\ngreat wonder is this! Certainly this is due to the influence of the Brahmi _n_\ni wife; this is, no doubt, the great effect of her virtue of chastity. We have\ngreatly oppressed the Bhargava women. They have become very sorry and\ndistressed; now we cannot tell what more evils do these women, of true\nresolve, inflict on us!\xc2\x94 Thus pondering, those K _s_ attriyas\n\ndeprived of their eyes, helpless, and their minds bewildered, took refuge of\nthose Brahmi _n_ ladies. The ladies, seeing them again come, were the more\nterrified; but those K _s_ attriyas bowed down before them with\n\n\n\np. 543\n\n\n\nfolded hands for the restoration of their sights and said :-- \xc2\x93O Mother! We\nare your servants. Be gracious unto us. O Auspicious Ones! We are vicious K\n_s_ attriyas; O Mothers! What an amount of offence we have committed to you. O\nBeautiful Ones! We have become blind, no sooner we have seen you. O Angry\nOnes! No more we can see your lotus-like faces, as if we are born blind; O\nMother! The spirit of your asceticism is so very wonderful! We are sinners;\ntherefore by no means we can get our sight; therefore we have taken refuge\nunto you all; better give us back our eyesight and preserve our honour. O\nMother! Blindness is more dreadful than death; therefore do you show your\nmercy on us. Be pleased unto us and restore our eyesights and make us your\nslaves; no sooner we get back our sights, we will cease from these vicious\nacts and go to our homes. In future, we will never commit such heinous acts;\nfrom today we all become servants of the Bhargavas and we will serve them.\nForgive all our sins that we committed unconsciously; we promise that, in\nfuture, there will no more be any enmity between the Bhargavas and K _s_\nattriyas. O good-looking Ones! You pass your days happily with your sons; we\never bow down before you. O Auspicious Ones! Be graciously pleased unto us; no\nmore we will cherish any inimical feelings towards you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n29-44. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Bhargava lady heard their words and was\nthunderstruck and seeing those K _s_ attriyas bowing down before her, blind\nand distressed, consoled them and said, \xc2\x93O K _s_ attriyas! I have not taken\naway your sights nor am I displeased in any way with you. Now hear what is the\nreal cause. This child of Bhargava, born of my thigh, is exceedingly angry\ntowards you and has therefore made your eyesight still and to no purpose. For\nthe greed of wealth, you have slain the close relatives of this boy, those\nthat were quite innocent and virtuous ascetics and you have slain their\nchildren that were in their mothers\xc2\x92 wombs; this boy has come to know all\nthose things. O children! When you were slaying the children of the Bhargavas\nin their mothers\xc2\x92 wombs, I then bore within my thighs this child for one\nhundred years. This son of mine though as yet in the womb, has mastered all\nthe Vedas within so very short a time for the propagation of the Bhargava\nclan. Now this Bhargava son is infuriated with anger for your slaying his\nfather and is now ready to kill you all. My son! Whose divine effulgence has\ndestroyed your eyesights, is born of grace of the Highest Goddess, the\nBhagavati Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari; therefore do not consider this boy as an ordinary\nbeing. Now bow down with humility before this my son Aurvya (born from the\nthighs); this son may be pleased by your bowing down and may restore you your\neyesights.\n\n\n\np. 544\n\n\n\nVyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the words of the Brahmi _n_ lady, the\nHaihayas began to praise the boy with hymns. With great humility, they bowed\ndown to the best of the Munis, born of the thighs. The Ri _s_ i Aurvya, then,\nbecame pleased and spoke thus to the Haihayas who were deprived of their\neyesights :-- \xc2\x93Better go back to your own homes. O Kings! And read these\nfollowing words derived from my this story. Whatever is inevitable and created\nby the hands of gods must come to pass. Knowing this, no one ought to be\nsorrowful on any such matters. Let you all regain your eyesights as before and\nforego your anger and go to your own homes respectively at your own will. Let\nthe Ri _s_ is, too, get peace and happiness as before.\xc2\x94 When the Mahar _s_ i\nAurvya ordered thus, the Haihayas got back their eyesights and went at their\nleisure to their own homes; on the other hand the Brahmi _n_ lady went to her\nown hermitage, with her Divine-spirited child and began to nourish him. O\nKing! Thus I have described to you the story of the killing of the Bhargavas\nand how the K _s_ attriyas, actuated by greed, did so very vicious acts.\n\n\n\n45-48. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Ascetic! Hearing this exceedingly heart-rending\nact of the K _s_ attriyas, I come to know, that greed is the sole cause of it\nand both the parties had suffered so much, simply out of this insatiable\ngreed. O King of Munis! I want to ask you one more question in regard to this\npoint. How the sons of the Kings came to be known Haihayas in this world?\nAmongst the K _s_ attriyas, some are called Yadavas for they ware descended\nfrom the family of Yadu; some were known as Bharata, for they were descended\nfrom Bharata. But was some king named Haihaya born before in their family or\nwere they known as such on account of other actions? I desire to hear of it.\nKindly describe\n\nthis to me and oblige.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n49-56. Vyasa said :-- O King! I am describing in detail to you of the origin\nof the Haihayas. Hear. The sins are destroyed and the merits accrue on hearing\nthis story. O King! Once on a time Revanta, the son of the Sun, very beautiful\nand of boundless lustre, was going to Vi _sn_ u in Vaiku _nt_ ha, mounted on\nthe beautiful Uchchais\xc2\x92rava, the jewel of the horses. When he was going on\nhorseback with a desire to see the God Vi _sn_ u, the Goddess Lak _s_ mi saw\nthat child of the Sun. The Goddess Lak _s_ mi, born out of the churning of the\nocean, on looking at the beautiful appearance of her brother Horse, also born\nout of the churning of the ocean, became very much astonished and steadily\ngazed on him. The Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, capable to show both favour and\ndisfavour, saw the beautiful Revanta, of good figure, coming on horseback; and\nlovingly asked Lak _s_ mi :-- \xc2\x93O Beautiful One! Who is coming here on\nhorseback, as\n\n\n\np. 545\n\n\n\nit were, enchanting to the three worlds!\xc2\x94 At that time, the Goddess Lak _s_ mi\nwas accidentally looking intently on the horse; so she did not reply, though\nrepeatedly asked by the Bhagavan.\n\n\n\n57-68. The Lak _s_ mi Devi, always restless, was very much intent on the horse\nand was enchanted and She was looking steadily with great affection on the\nhorse. Seeing this, the Bhagavan became angry and said :-- \xc2\x93O Beautiful-eyed\nOne! What you are looking at so intently? Are you so much enchanted with the\nsight of the horse that you are not speaking to me a single word, though I am\nrepeatedly asking you so often! You lovingly dwell on all the objects; hence\nyour name is Rama; your mind is also very restless, therefore you would be\nknown as Chanchala Devi (the restless Devi). O Auspicious One! You are\nrestless like ordinary women; you can never stay steadily for a certain time\nat any one place. While sitting before Me, you are enchanted with the sight of\na horse; then you be born as a mare in that world of men, full of dreadful\ntroubles, on the surface of the earth. The Goddess Lak _s_ mi became very much\naffrightened at the sudden curse given by Hari, a matter as it were ordained\nby the Devas, and began to cry aloud, shuddering with pain and sorrows. Lak\n_s_ mi Devi, then of sweet smiles, frightened, bowed down with great humility\nto her own lord Naraya _n_ a and said thus :-- O Deva of the Devas! O Govinda!\nYou are the Lord of this world and the Ocean of mercy. O Kes\xc2\x92ava! Why have you\ninflicted on me so dreadful a curse for such a minor fault of mine! O Lord! I\nnever saw you before so very angry; Alas! Where has now gone that affection,\nso natural and undying, that you showed towards me! O Lord! It is not proper\nto hurl a thunderbolt on one\xc2\x92s own relations; but it is advisable to cast it\non the enemies. I am always fit for receiving boons from you. Why have you\nmade me now an object, fit for curse. O Govinda! I will quit this life in Your\npresence. I will never be able to live, separated from You. O Lord! Be\ngraciously pleased and say when shall I be free from this dreadful curse and\nregain Your happy companion?\n\n\n\n69\\. The Bhagavan said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! When you will get a son in the world like\nme, you will no doubt come again to be my companion.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventeenth Chapter on the continuance of the family of Bhrigu\nin the Sixth Book in the Mahapura _n_ am, S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 18](bk06ch18.htm)\n\n'
