Verily, man is born thrice, namely in this way:--first he is born\nfrom his mother and father; and when he to whom the sacrifice inclines\nperforms offering he is born a second time; and when he dies, and they place\nhim on the fire, and when he\n\np. 24\n\nthereupon comes into existence again, he is born a third time;--wherefore they\nsay, 'Man is born thrice.'\n\n11:2:1:22\\. He (the Hot _ri_ ) recites those eleven kindling-verses 1,--there\nare these ten vital airs in man, and the body in which these vital airs are\nestablished is the eleventh,--so great, indeed, is man: he thus causes him to\nbe born complete. And what comes after the kindling-verses that is the\nfoundation: thus, having caused him to be born, he establishes him.\n\n11:2:1:33\\. There are nine utterances of impulsion (or quickening) 2,--there\nare these nine vital airs in man: he thereby causes him to be born a second\ntime; and the (Adhvaryu's) call and (the \xc3\x82gnidhra's) response 3 are the\nfoundation. And when there, on the occasion of the throwing 4 (of the grass-\nbunch\n\np. 25\n\ninto the fire), birth is spoken of, he thereby causes him to be born a third\ntime: on this occasion the Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as 1 are the foundation.\n\n11:2:1:44\\. For thrice, indeed, man is born, and it is just in this way that\nhe causes him to be born thrice from the sacrifice. Of those eleven (kindling-\nverses) he recites thrice the first and last:--\n\n11:2:1:55\\. This makes fifteen kindling-verses,--there are two libations of\nghee (aghara 2), five fore-offerings, the I _d_ a, three after-offerings, the\nSuktavaka, and _S_ amyorvaka 3\\--that makes thirteen oblations. And when\nthere, at the Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as, he takes up at the same time (the two\nspoons); and the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us 4:--\n\n11:2:1:66\\. That makes fifteen oblations:--for these fifteen oblations those\nfifteen kindling-verses (serve, as it were, as) invitatory formulas; and for\nthese invitatory formulas these (serve as) offering-formulas--whatever formula\n(is used) there (at those oblations) and what Nigada (is used at the\ninvocation of the I _d_ a 5) that is of the form of offering-formulas.\nThereby, then, those oblations of his come to be supplied with invitatory\nformulas through those kindling-verses; and through those oblations those\ninvitatory formulas come to be supplied with both offering-formulas and\noblations.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[24:1](sbe44011.htm#fr_123) See part i, p. 95 seqq.\n\n[24:2](sbe44011.htm#fr_124) According to Saya _n_ a, this refers either to the\nformula by which the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot _ri_ to recite the kindling-\nverses, and which, he says, consists of nine syllables\n(samidhyamanayanubruhi); or to nine preliminary formulas (forming a nigada)\npronounced by the Hot _ri_ before the performance of the fore-offerings, see\nI, 5, 2, 1 seqq. These latter formulas are probably those intended by the\nauthor; the former formula being the less likely to be referred to, as, in its\nabove form of nine syllables, it is indeed allowed to be used optionally by\nthe \xc3\x82pastambasutra, but not by the authorities of the white Ya _g_ us, who use\nthe formula '(Hotar) Agnaye samidhyamanayanubruhi;' see _S_ at. Br. I, 3, 5,\n2. 3.\n\n[24:3](sbe44011.htm#fr_125) Viz. the two calls--'O _m_ _s_ ravaya' and 'Astu\n_s_ rausha _t_ ,' see part i, p. 132, note.\n\n[24:4](sbe44011.htm#fr_126) The word 's _ri_ sh _t_ i' usually means\n'creation,' but in accordance with the primary meaning of the verb 's _ri_ _g_\n,' it apparently refers here (as Saya _n_ a seems to think) to the throwing of\nthe anointed Prastara, as the representative of the Sacrificer, into the\n\xc3\x82havaniya fire, thus insuring for the Sacrificer his despatch to, and renewed\nlife in, the heavenly world. With reference to p. 25 this throwing of the\ngrass-bunch into the fire (I, 8, 3, 11 seq.; 9, 2, 19) some of the Sutras use,\nindeed, the verb 's _ri_ _g_ ,' cf. Hillebrand, Das Altindische Neu- and\nVollmondsopfer, p.146.\n\n[25:1](sbe44011.htm#fr_127) See part i, p. 256 seqq.\n\n[25:2](sbe44011.htm#fr_128) See part i, p. 124 seqq.\n\n[25:3](sbe44011.htm#fr_129) Part i, p. 236 seqq.\n\n[25:4](sbe44011.htm#fr_130) See I, 9, 2, 19; 25 seqq.\n\n[25:5](sbe44011.htm#fr_131) See part i, p. 222 seqq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 2, 2.
