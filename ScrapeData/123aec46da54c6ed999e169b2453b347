The existence (of mental impressions) is not possible (on the Bauddha\nview, on account of the absence of perception (of external things).\n\nWe now proceed to that theory of yours, according to which the variety of\nideas can be explained from the\n\np. 426\n\nvariety of mental impressions, without any reference to external things, and\nremark that on your doctrine the existence of mental impressions is\nimpossible, as you do not admit the perception of external things. For the\nvariety of mental impressions is caused altogether by the variety of the\nthings perceived. How, indeed, could various impressions originate if no\nexternal things were perceived? The hypothesis of a beginningless series of\nmental impressions would lead only to a baseless regressus ad infinitum,\nsublative of the entire phenomenal world, and would in no way establish your\nposition.--The same argument, i.e. the one founded on the impossibility of\nmental impressions which are not caused by external things, refutes also the\npositive and negative judgments, on the ground of which the denier of an\nexternal world above attempted to show that ideas are caused by mental\nimpressions, not by external things. We rather have on our side a positive and\na negative judgment whereby to establish our doctrine of the existence of\nexternal things, viz. 'the perception of external things is admitted to take\nplace also without mental impressions,' and 'mental impressions are not\nadmitted to originate independently of the perception of external things.'--\nMoreover, an impression is a kind of modification, and modifications cannot,\nas experience teaches, take place unless there is some substratum which is\nmodified. But, according to your doctrine, such a substratum of impressions\ndoes not exist, since you say that it cannot be cognised through any means of\nknowledge.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 31](sbe34207.htm)\n\n"
