Suta said :-- Seeing the two Danavas very powerful, Brahma, the knower\nof all the S\xc2\x92astras, thought of the means Sama, Dana, Bheda, Dan _d_ a\n(conciliation, gifts, bribe, or sowing dissensions and war or punishment);\nwhich of these four he should apply. He thought thus :-- \xc2\x93I do not know their\nstrength and it is not advisable to enter into war without knowing their\nstrength. Again if I offer praises to them puffed up with pride, it will be\nsimply displaying my own weakness; and when they will come to know this, only\none of them will be sufficient to kill me and this they will do certainly. To\noffer bribes is not also advisable; and how can I sow dissensions. Therefore\nit is best that I should rouse the four armed Janardana Vi _sn_ u, who is very\npowerful, from his sleep on the thousand headed Ananta serpent. He will remove\nmy difficulties\xc2\x94.\n\n\n\nThus thinking in his mind, Bhagavan Brahma, the lotus-born remained in the\ntubular stalk of the lotus from Vi _sn_ u\'s navel and thence took refuge\nmentally of Vi _sn_ u, the remover of difficulties and began to chant\nauspicious hymns composed of various metres to Jagannath Narayana, involved in\ndeep Yoganidra (meditative sleep). He said :-- \xc2\x93O Refuge of the poor! O Hari!\nO Vi _sn_ u! O Vamana! O Madhava, Thou art the Lord of the universe and\nomnipresent. O Hrisikes\'a! Thou removest all the difficulties of Thy devotees;\ntherefore leave your Yoganidra and get up. O Vasudeva! O Lord of the Universe!\nThou residest within the hearts of all and knowest their desires.\n\n\n\nO Thou, holder of the disc and club! Thou always destroyest the enemies of Thy\ndevotees; O Omniscient One! Thou art the Lord of all the Lokas and all-\npowerful; no one can know what is Thy form; O Lord of the Devas! Thou art the\ndestroyer of all pains and sufferings! So get up and protect me. O Protector\nof the Universe! nothing is concealed from Thy eyes! Every one becomes pure by\nhearing and chanting Thy name. Thou art Nirakara (without any form); yet Thou\ncreatest, preservest and destroyest the Universe. O Cause of the world! O\nSupporter of all! Thou art shining as king of kings over all and yet Thou dost\nnot understand that the two Danavas, puffed\n\n\n\np. 23\n\n\n\nup with pride have become ready to kill me. If thou dost neglect me, seeing me\nvery much distressed and under your protection then Thy name as Preserver will\nbecome quite useless. Thus praised, when Vi _sn_ u did not get up, Brahma\nthought that "Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u is now surely under the influence of sleep of\nthe Primal Force \xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti and is not therefore getting up; what am I to do\nnow, thus distressed! These two Danavas, elated with pride are ready to kill\nme; now what am I to do and where shall I go? I don\'t find any body who can\nprotect me any where.\xc2\x94 Thus thinking, Brahma came to the conclusion and\ndecided to chant hymns to Yoga Nidra Herself with one pointed heart.\nDiscussing in his mind, He thought that that \xc3\x82dya S\xc2\x92akti (the Prime Force)\nwhich kept Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, senseless and motionless would alone be able to\nsave him. As a dead man cannot hear any sound so Hari, merged in deep sleep,\nknows not anything. When I have praised Him so much and when He has not\nawakened, then it is certain that sleep is not under Hari, but Hari is under\nsleep, and he who is under another becomes his slave; so this Yoga Nidra is\nnow exercising Her control over Hari. Again she, too, who brought Hari under\ncontrol, that daughter of the Kr _s i_ra (milk) ocean is now under the control\nof Yoga Nidra; so it seems that that Bhagavati Mahamaya has brought the whole\nUniverse under Her control.\n\n\n\nWhether it be Myself, or Vi _sn_ u or S\xc2\x92ambhu, or Savitri or Rama or Uma, all\nare under Her control; there is nothing to be doubted here? What to speak of\nother high souled persons! Now I will chant hymns to Yoga Nidra, under whose\ninfluence Bhagavan Hari even is lying, under deep sleep, inert like an\nordinary man. When the eternal Vasudeva Janardana will be dispossessed by Her,\nHe will no doubt fight with the Danavas. Thus deciding, Bhagavan Brahma,\nseated on the tubular stalk of the lotus, began to chant hymns to Yoga Nidra,\nresiding on the body of Vi _sn_ u, thus :--\n\n\n\n27-32. Brahma said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! I have come to understand on the authority of\nall the words of the Vedas, that Thou art the only One Cause of this Universal\nBrahmanda. The more so when Thou hast brought the best Puru _s_ a Vi _sn_ u,\nendowed with discrimination above all beings, under the control of sleep, then\nthe above remark is self-evident.\n\n\n\nO Thou, the Player in the minds of all beings! O Mother! I am extremely\nignorant of the knowledge of Thy nature; when Bhagavan Hari is sleeping inert\nby Thy power, then who is there amongst Ko _t_ is and Ko _t_ is of wise men,\nwho can understand completely the Pastime, Leela, full of Maya of Thine, who\nart beyond the Gu _n_ as. The Sankhya philosophers say (that the Puru _s_ a\n(the male aspect of S\xc2\x92akti)\n\n\n\np. 24\n\n\n\nis the pure, conscious being and that Thou art the Prakriti, without any\nconsciousness, material inert, Creatrix of the universe; but, O Mother! art\nThou really inert like that? Never like that; had it been like that, how is it\nthat Thou hast made Bhagavan Hari, the receptable of the world quite\nunconscious like this? O Bhavani! Thou, being beyond the Gu _n_ as art\ndisplaying like a dramatic performance these various dramatic plays by the\nconjunction with the three Gu _n_ as. It is Thy three qualities, Sattva, Rajas\nand Tamas that the Munis meditate every day in the morning mid-day, and\nevening, the three Sandhyas; but no one is aware of Thy ways of doings. O\nDevi! Thou art of the nature of the judgment and understanding giving rise to\nknowledge of all the beings in the Universe; Thou art always the S\xc2\x92ri (wealth\nand prosperity) giving pleasures to the Devas. O Mother! Thou art reigning in\nall as Kirti (fame), mati (intellect), Dhriti (fortitude). Kanti (beauty)\nS\xc2\x92raddha (faith) and Rati (enjoyment). O Mother! Now I am put to great\ndifficulties and therefore I have got eye witness of Thy nature; no need of\nfurther reasoning and discussing about it.\n\n\n\n27-50. I have now known that verily, verily Thou art the only Mother of all\nthe worlds as Thou hast brought Hari under the influence of sleep. O Devi! Now\nwhen it is evident that all the worlds, etc., have come from Thee, then the\nVedas have also come from Thee; what doubt is there? So the Vedas, too, do not\nknow fully Thy nature; for the effect can never know its cause. So, it is very\ntrue that Thou art incomprehensible of the Vedas, O Mother! When I, Hari, Hara\nand the other Devas and my son Narada and other Munis have not able to realise\nThy nature fully, then who else can be so intelligent in this world that will\nrealise all Thy nature? So Thy glory is beyond the speech of all beings. O\nDevi! If, in the place of sacrifice, the ritualists, the knowers of the Vedas,\ndo not utter Thy name Svaha, then the Devas, participators of the offerings in\nYaj\xc3\xb1a, do not get their share, however hundreds of oblations be offered; so\nThou art also the giver of sustenance allowances to the Devas. O Bhagavati! In\nprevious Kalpas, Thou hadst saved me terrified from the fear of the Danavas. O\nDevi Varade! now, too, I am terrified at the sight of the terrible forms of\nMadhu and Kai _t_ abha and take Thy refuge. O high-minded one! Now I\nthoroughly see that by Thee, by Thy power Yoganidra the whole body of Bhagavan\nVi _sn_ u is senseless; but how is it that Thou dost not realise my\nsufferings. So, either dost Thou leave possession of this \xc3\x82di-Deva, or destroy\nThyself these two Danavendras -- lost do either of the two as Thou likest. O\nDevi! Those that do not know Thy extraordinary powers, those stupid ones\nmeditate Hari, Hara, etc. But, O Mother! By Thy grace, I realise to-day, as\neye-witness, that Vi _sn_ u even is to-day lying unconscious in deep sleep,\ntotally senseless of anything\n\n\n\n\n\noutside by Thy force. O Bhagavati! Now, when Kamala, the daughter of Sindhu is\nunable to rouse Her husband Hari, by her effort, or rather Thou hast made Her,\ntoo, perforce, sleep unconsciously, it seems she is without any effort and\ndoes not know anything of what is going on outside. O Devi! Verily those are\nblessed who worship Thy lotus feet with their whole heart full of devotion and\nwithout any hope of getting rewards, abandoning the worship of other Devas and\nknowing Thee as the Creatrix of the whole world and the giver of all desires.\nAlas! now the intelligence, beauty, fame, and all good qualities have forsaken\nHari and fled away to some unknown quarters. O Bhagavati! Thou art really\nadorable in the three worlds for, by Thy power of Yoganidra, Hari has been\nkept in prison, as it were, in this way. O Mother! Thou art the S\xc2\x92akti of all\nthis universe and endowed with all prowess and energy; all other things are\nThy creation. As a dramatic player, though one, plays in the theatre, assuming\nmany forms, so Thou, too, being one, playest always in this charming theatre\nof world, created by Thy Gu _n_ as, in various forms.\n\n\n\nO Mother! Thou, in the beginning of the Yugas, dost manifest first the Vi _sn_\nu form and givest him the pure Sattrik Sakti, free from any obscuration and\nthereby madest Him preserve the Universe; and now it is Thyself that hast kept\nHim thus unconscious; therefore, it is an undoubted fact that Thou art doing\nwhatever Thou willest, O Bhagavati! I am now in danger; if it be Thy desire\nnot to kill me, then dost break the silence, look on me and show Thy mercy. O\nBhavani! If it be not Thy desire to kill me, then why hast Thou created these\ntwo Danavas, my death incarnate; or is it that Thou wantedest to put me to\nridicule. I have come to know of Thy wonderful acts; Thou createst this whole\nUniverse, and Thyself remaining aloof, playest always and in the time of\nPralaya resolvest everything again into Thee. Therefore, O Bhavani, what\nwonder is there, that Thou wouldst want to kill me in this way? But, O Mother!\nI won\'t feel any pain if Thou willingly killest me but this is to my great\ndishonour that being given power over these beings, I would then be made an\nobject to be killed by the Daityas; this, indeed, is hard to me. So, O Thou\nLeelamayi like a sportive girl! get up! O Devi! assumest the wonderful form\nThyself and killest me or the two Daityas, as Thou willest; or rouse Hari who\nwill then kill the Daityas. All these are in Thy hands.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nSuta said :-- Thus praised by Brahma, the Nidra Devi (the goddess of sleep),\nof the nature of Tamo Gunas, quitted the body of Bhagavan Hari and stood by\nhim. When thus left completely by the Devi Yoga Nidra, of unequalled\nbrilliance and splendour, for the destruction of Madhu Kai _t_ abha, Vi _sn_ u\nbegan to move his body and at this Brahma became very glad.\n\n\n\np. 26\n\n\n\nThus ends the seventh chapter of the First Skandha on the praise of the Devi\nin the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_\ni Vedavyas.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 8](bk01ch08.htm)\n\n'
