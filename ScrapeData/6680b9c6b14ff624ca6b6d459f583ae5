Now the mounting of a chariot (is declared).\n\n2\\. After he has given the order, 'Put the horses to it,' and it has been\nannounced, 'They are,' he goes to (the chariot, saying), 'This is the Vira _g_\n,' and touches the two wheels,\n\np. 364\n\n3\\. The right (wheel) with (the words), 'The Rathantara art thou'\xc2\x97\n\n4\\. The left with (the words), 'The B _ri_ hat art thou'\xc2\x97\n\n5\\. The pole with (the words), 'The Vamadevya art thou.'\n\n6 6. He touches the interior of the chariot with his hand (saying), 'The two\nA\xe1\xb9\x85kas, the two Nya\xe1\xb9\x85kas which are on both sides of the chariot, which move\nforward with the rushing wind, the far-darting one with keen senses, the\nwinged one, may these fires, the promoters, promote us.'\n\n7 7. With (the words), 'Adoration to Ma _n_ i _k_ ara,' he drives on the beast\non the right side.\n\n8\\. (If going in his chariot) toward (images of) gods, let him descend (from\nthe chariot) before he has reached them; if toward Brahma _n_ as, just before\n(reaching them); if toward cows, when amid them; if toward fathers, when he\nhas reached them.\n\n9\\. A woman or a Vedic student shall not be charioteers.\n\np. 365\n\n10\\. Having driven a moment beyond (the point to which he intends to go) he\nshould murmur, 'Here is rest, rest here' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. VIII, 51).\n\n11 11. Some add (the words), 'Here shall be no rest.'\n\n12\\. If the chariot is weak, he should murmur, after he has mounted it, 'May\nthis your chariot, O A _s_ vins, suffer no damage on bad ways or by being\noverthrown.'\n\n13 13. If the horses run away with the chariot, he should touch the post (?)\nor the earth and should murmur, 'May this your chariot, O A _s_ vins, suffer\nno damage on bad ways or by being overthrown.'\n\n14\\. Thus he will suffer no harm and no damage.\n\n15 15. When he has finished his way, and has unyoked the horses, let him have\ngrass and water given to them. 'For thus satisfaction is given to the beast\nthat draws (the cart)'\xc2\x97says the _S_ ruti.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[364:6](sbe29204.htm#fr_954) 14, 6. The meaning of a\xe1\xb9\x85kau and nya\xe1\xb9\x85kau cannot be\ndetermined, as far as I can see. The commentators explain the words as the two\nwheels and the two sides of the chariot, or as the two right wheels and the\ntwo left wheels of a four-wheeled chariot. Professor Zimmer (Altindisches\nLeben, pp. 251 seq.) compares a\xe1\xb9\x85ka with \xe1\xbc\x84\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xcf\x85\xce\xbe, and says, 'Mit a\xe1\xb9\x85kau (resp.\na\xe1\xb9\x85ku) ware daher die obere Einfassung des Wagenkastens (ko _s_ a, vandhura)\nbezeichnet, mit nya\xe1\xb9\x85kau (resp. nya\xe1\xb9\x85ku) ein zu grosserer Befestigung etwas\nweiter unten (ni) herumlaufender Stab.' To me it seems that a\xe1\xb9\x85kau and nya\xe1\xb9\x85kau\nare to be understood both as designations of certain parts of the chariot and\nas names of different forms of Agni dwelling in the chariot.\xc2\x97Comp. Taittiriya\nSa _m_ hita I, 7, 7, 2; Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avi _m_ _s_ a Brahma _n_ a I, 7, 5.\n\n[364:7](sbe29204.htm#fr_955) The name of the demon Ma _n_ i _k_ ara occurs, as\nfar as I know, only here.\n\n[365:11](sbe29204.htm#fr_956) If the reading of the text is correct, the\nmeaning would seem to be: We will rest here for a while, but then we will go\nfurther.\n\n[365:13](sbe29204.htm#fr_957) I cannot say what 'the post' (stambha) here\nmeans; it may be apart of the chariot. _G_ ayarama has dhva _g_ astambha, i.e.\nthe staff of a flag, which we are to suppose was carried on the chariot. This\nmay be the right explanation.\n\n[365:15](sbe29204.htm#fr_958) _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a I, 8, 2, 9.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 15](sbe29205.htm)\n\n"
