Moreover, of this Brahman, which is the cause of the\nentire world, certain qualities have (implicitly) been declared, such as all-\npervadingness, eternity, omniscience, its being the Self of all, and so on.\nFurther, by producing reasons showing that some words which are generally used\nin a different sense denote Brahman also, we have been able to determine that\nsome passages about whose sense doubts are entertained refer to Brahman. Now\ncertain other passages present themselves which because containing only\nobscure indications of Brahman give rise to the doubt whether they refer to\nthe highest Self or to something else. We therefore begin the second and third\npadas in order to settle those doubtful points.\n\n1\\. (That which consists of mind is Brahman) because there is taught what is\nknown from everywhere.\n\nScripture says, 'All this indeed is Brahman, beginning, ending, and breathing\nin it; thus knowing let a man meditate with calm mind. Now man is made of\ndetermination (kratu); according to what his determination is in this world so\nwill he be when he has departed this life. Let him therefore form this\ndetermination: he who consists of mind, whose body is breath (the subtle\nbody),' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14). Concerning this passage the doubt presents\nitself whether what is pointed out as the object of meditation, by means of\nattributes such as consisting of mind, &c., is the embodied (individual) soul\nor the highest Brahman.\n\nThe embodied Self, the purvapakshin says.--Why?--Because the embodied Self as\nthe ruler of the organs of action is well known to be connected with the mind\nand so on, while the highest Brahman is not, as is declared in several\nscriptural passages, so, for instance (Mu. Up. II, 1, 2),\n\np. 108\n\n[paragraph continues] 'He is without breath, without mind, pure.'--But, it may\nbe objected, the passage, 'All this indeed is Brahman,' mentions Brahman\ndirectly; how then can you suppose that the embodied Self forms the object of\nmeditation?--This objection does not apply, the purvapakshin rejoins, because\nthe passage does not aim at enjoining meditation on Brahman, but rather at\nenjoining calmness of mind, the sense being: because Brahman is all this, ta\n_gg_ alan, let a man meditate with a calm mind. That is to say: because all\nthis aggregate of effects is Brahman only, springing from it, ending in it,\nand breathing in it; and because, as everything constitutes one Self only,\nthere is no room for passion; therefore a man is to meditate with a calm mind.\nAnd since the sentence aims at enjoining calmness of mind, it cannot at the\nsame time enjoin meditation on Brahman 1; but meditation is separately\nenjoined in the clause, 'Let him form the determination, i.e. reflection.' And\nthereupon the subsequent passage, 'He who consists of mind, whose body is\nbreath,' &c. states the object of the meditation in words indicatory of the\nindividual soul. For this reason we maintain that the meditation spoken of has\nthe individual soul for its object. The other attributes also subsequently\nstated in the text, 'He to whom all works, all desires belong,' &c. may\nrightly be held to refer to the individual soul. The attributes, finally, of\nbeing what abides in the heart and of being extremely minute which are\nmentioned in the passage, 'He is my Self within the heart, smaller than a corn\nof rice, smaller than a corn of barley,' may be ascribed to the individual\nsoul which has the size of the point of a goad, but not to the unlimited\nBrahman. If it be objected that the immediately following passage, 'greater\nthan the earth,' &c., cannot refer to something limited, we reply that\nsmallness and greatness which are mutually opposite cannot indeed be ascribed\nto one and the same thing; and that, if one attribute\n\np. 109\n\nonly is to be ascribed to the subject of the passage, smallness is preferable\nbecause it is mentioned first; while the greatness mentioned later on may be\nattributed to the soul in so far as it is one with Brahman. If it is once\nsettled that the whole passage refers to the individual soul, it follows that\nthe declaration of Brahman also, contained in the passage, 'That is Brahman'\n(III, 14, 4), refers to the individual soul 1, as it is clearly connected with\nthe general topic. Therefore the individual soul is the object of meditation\nindicated by the qualities of consisting of mind and so on.\n\nTo all this we reply: The highest Brahman only is what is to be meditated upon\nas distinguished by the attributes of consisting of mind and so on.--Why?--'On\naccount of there being taught here what is known from everywhere.' What is\nknown from all Vedanta-passages to be the sense of the word Brahman, viz. the\ncause of the world, and what is mentioned here in the beginning words of the\npassage, ('all this indeed is Brahman,') the same we must assume to be taught\nhere as distinguished by certain qualities, viz. consisting of mind and so on.\nThus we avoid the fault of dropping the subject-matter under discussion and\nneedlessly introducing a new topic.--But, it may be said, it has been shown\nthat Brahman is, in the beginning of the passage, introduced merely for the\npurpose of intimating the injunction of calmness of mind, not for the purpose\nof intimating Brahman itself.--True, we reply; but the fact nevertheless\nremains that, where the qualities of consisting of mind, &c. are spoken of,\nBrahman only is proximate (i.e. mentioned not far off so that it may be\nconcluded to be the thing referred to), while the individual soul is neither\nproximate nor intimated by any word directly pointing to it. The cases of\nBrahman and the individual soul are therefore not equal.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[108:1](sbe34038.htm#fr_140) The clause 'he is to meditate with a calm mind'\nif taken as a gu _n_ avidhi, i.e. as enjoining some secondary matter, viz.\ncalmness of mind of the meditating person, cannot at the same time enjoin\nmeditation; for that would involve a so-called split of the sentence\n(vakyabheda).\n\n[109:1](sbe34038.htm#fr_141) _G_ ive#pi dehadib _rim_ hana _g_ _g_\nyastvanyayad va brahmatety artha _h_. \xc3\x82n.
