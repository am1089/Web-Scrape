O warrior, stay:  \n'Turn on the foe, and rend and slay:'  \nSuch were the cries, such words of fear  \nSmote through the gloom each listening ear.  \nEach swarthy rover of the night  \nWhose golden armour flashed with light,  \nShowed like a towering hill embraced  \nBy burning woods about his waist.  \nThe giants at the Vanars flew,  \nAnd ravening ate the foes they slew:  \nWith mortal bite like serpent's fang,  \nThe Vanars at the giants sprang,  \nAnd car and steeds and they who bore  \nThe pennons fell bedewed with gore,  \nNo serried band, no firm array  \nThe fury of their charge could stay  \nDown went the horse and rider, down  \nWent giant lords of high renown.  \nThough midnight's shade was dense and dark,  \nWith skill that swerved not from the mark  \n\nTheir bows the sons of Raghu drew,  \nAnd each keen shaft a chieftain slew.  \nUprose the blinding dust from meads  \nPloughed by the cars and trampling steeds,  \nAnd where the warriors fell the flood  \nWas dark and terrible with blood.  \nSix giants  [1b](ry444.htm#fn_962) singled Rama out,  \nAnd charged him with a furious shout  \nLoud as the roaring of the sea  \nWhen every wind is raging free.  \nSix times he shot: six heads were cleft;  \nSix giants dead on earth were left.  \nNor ceased he yet: his bow he strained,  \nAnd from the sounding weapon rained  \nA storm of shafts whose fiery glare  \nFilled all the region of the air;  \nAnd chieftains dropped before his aim  \nLike moths that perish in the flame.  \nEarth glistened where the arrows fell,  \nAs shines in autumn nights a dell  \nWhich fireflies, flashing through the gloom,  \nWith momentary light illume.  \n\nBut Indrajit, when Bali's son  [2b](ry444.htm#fn_963)  \nThe victory o'er the foe had won.  \nSaw with a fury-kindled eye  \nHis mangled steeds and driver die;  \nThen, lost in air, he fled the fight,  \nAnd vanished from the victor's sight.  \nThe Gods and saints glad voices raised,  \nAnd Angad for his virtue praised;  \nAnd Raghu's sons bestowed the meed  \nOf honour due to valorous deed.  \n\nCompelled his shattered car to quit,  \nRage filled the soul of Indrajit,  \nWho brooked not, strong by Brahma's grace  \nDefeat from one of Vanar race.  \nIn magic mist concealed from view  \nHis bow the treacherous warrior drew,  \nAnd Raghu's sons were first to feel  \nThe tempest of his winged steel.  \nThen when his arrows failed to kill  \nThe princes who defied him still,  \nHe bound them with the serpent noose,  [3b](ry444.htm#fn_964)  \nThe magic bond which none might loose.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[460:1](ry442.htm#fr_961) I have omitted several of these single combats, as\nthere is little variety in the details and each duel results in the victory of\nthe Vanar or his ally.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLV.: Indrajit's Victory.](ry444.htm)\n\n"
