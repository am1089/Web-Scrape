Now they quote also (the following verse): 'As cotton and reeds, thrown\ninto a fire, blaze up, even so all the guilt of him who sacrifices to the soul\nis consumed;'\n\np. 265\n\n2\\. (Moreover), 'He who eats merely (in order to satisfy his own hunger) reaps\nonly guilt. In vain (the fool) takes food.' 2\n\n3\\. Let him daily, both in the morning and in the evening, sacrifice in this\nmanner;\n\n4, Or (he may offer) water in the evening.\n\n5\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): Let him first feed his guests,\nnext the pregnant women, then the infants and the aged, thereafter the\ndistressed and particularly the diseased. But he who eats first, without\nhaving given (food) to those (persons) according to the rule, does not know\nthat he is being eaten. He does not eat, (but) he is eaten.' 5\n\n6\\. 'Let him eat silently what remains, (after he has given their portions) to\nthe manes, the gods, the servants, his parents, and his Gurus; that is\ndeclared to be the rule of the sacred law.' 6\n\n7\\. Nov they quote also (the following verses): Eight mouthfuls are the meal\nof an ascetic, sixteen that of a hermit in the woods, thirty-two that of a\nhouseholder, and an unlimited (quantity) that of a student.'\n\n8\\. 'An Agnihotrin, a draught-ox, and, a student, those three can do their\nwork only if they eat (much); without eating (much) they cannot do it.'\n\n9\\. 'A householder, or a student who practises 9\n\np. 266\n\nausterity by fasting, becomes an Avakir _n_ in through the omission of the\nsacrifice to the vital airs;'\n\n10\\. Except when he performs a penance. In the case of a penance that\n(fasting) is the rule.\n\n11\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'He who never eats between\nthe morning and the evening meals, (obtains the same reward as he who)\nconstantly fasts.'\n\n12\\. 'As in case one obtains no materials (for the sacrifice), one must mutter\nthe sacred texts to be recited at the Agnihotra, offered in the three fires,\neven so one should mutter the texts to be recited at the Pra _n_ agnihotra,\nwhen one is prevented from dining.'\n\n13\\. 'He who acts thus, will become one with Brahman.' Thus spake Pra _g_\napati (the lord of created beings).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[265:2](sbe1467.htm#fr_1268) **13**.
