The (rites) based on the spreading (of the three sacred fires) have been\ndeclared; we shall declare the G _ri_ hya (rites).\n\n2 2. There are three (kinds of) Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, the hutas, (i.e. the\nsacrifices) offered over the fire; over something that is not the fire, the\nprahutas; and at the feeding of Brahma _n_ as, those offered in the Brahman.\n\n3 3. And they quote also _Ri_ _k_ as, \'He who with a piece of wood or with an\noblation, or with knowledge ("veda").\'\n\np. 160\n\n4 4. Even he who only puts a piece of wood (on the fire) full of belief,\nshould think, \'Here I offer a sacrifice; adoration to that (deity)!\'\n\n(The _Ri_ _k_ quoted above then says), \'He who with an oblation\'\xc2\x97and, \'He who\nwith knowledge;\' even by learning only satisfaction is produced (in the gods).\n\nSeeing this the _Ri_ shi has said, \'To him who does not keep away from himself\nthe cows, to him who longs for cows, who dwells in the sky, speak a wonderful\nword, sweeter than ghee and honey.\' Thereby he means, \'This my word, sweeter\nthan ghee and honey, is satisfaction (to the god); may it be sweeter.\'\n\n(And another _Ri_ shi says), \'To thee, O Agni, by this _Ri_ _k_ we offer an\noblation prepared by our heart; may these be oxen, bulls, and cows.\' (Thereby\nhe means), \'They are my oxen, bulls, and cows (which I offer to the god), they\nwho study this text, reciting it for themselves (as their Svadhyaya).\'\n\n(And further on the _Ri_ _k_ quoted above says), \'He who (worships Agni) with\nadoration, offering rich sacrifices.\' \'Verily also by the performing of\nadoration (the gods may be worshipped); for the gods are not beyond the\nperforming of adoration; adoration verily is sacrifice\'\xc2\x97thus runs a Brahma _n_\na.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[159:1](sbe29100.htm#fr_359) 1, 1. The spreading (vitana or, as it is also\ncalled, vihara or vistara) of the sacred fires is the taking of two of the\nthree sacrificial fires, the \xc3\x82havaniya fire and the Dakshi _n_ agni, out of\nthe Garhapatya fire (see, for instance, Weber\'s Indische Studien, IX, 216\nseq.). The rites based on, or connected with the vitana; are the rites forming\nthe subject of the _S_ rauta ritual, which are to be performed with the three\nfires.\n\n[159:2](sbe29100.htm#fr_360) Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I, 5, 1; I, 10, 7.\nThe division here is somewhat different from that given by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana; what\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana calls ahuta, is here prahuta (\'sacrificed up\'); the prahutas of\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana form here no special category; the pra _s_ itas of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana\nare the brahma _n_ i hutas of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana. Thus \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana has three\ncategories, while _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana (and quite in the same way Paraskara I, 4, 1)\ngives four. Naraya _n_ a mentions as an example of prahuta sacrifices the\nbalihara _n_ a prescribed below, I, 2, 3.\n\n[159:3](sbe29100.htm#fr_361) Rig-veda VIII, 19, 5, The mortal who with a piece\nof wood, or with an oblation, or with knowledge worships Agni, who with\nadoration (worships him) offering rich sacrifices,\' &c.\n\n[160:4](sbe29100.htm#fr_362) The words of the _Ri_ _k_ , \'with an oblation,\'\nare here repeated, the Vedic instrumental ahuti being replaced and explained\nby the regular form ahutya.\n\nThe following _Ri_ _k_ is taken from the eighth Ma _n_ _d_ ala, 24, 20. The\ngod compared there with a rutting bull is Indra.\n\nThe following verse is Rig-veda VI, 16, 47; we may doubt as to the correctness\nof the explanation given in our text, by which te te is referred to the\npersons studying the hymns of the _Ri_ shi. All these quotations of course are\nmeant to show that the knowledge of the Veda and the performing of namas\n(adoration) is equivalent to a real sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2](sbe29101.htm)\n\n'
