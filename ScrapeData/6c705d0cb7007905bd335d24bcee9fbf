The law of castes and of orders has been declared. 1\n\n2\\. Now, indeed, man (in) this (world) is polluted by a vile action, such as\nsacrificing for men unworthy to offer a sacrifice, eating forbidden food,\nspeaking what ought not to be spoken, neglecting what is prescribed,\npractising what is forbidden. 2\n\n3\\. They are in doubt if he shall perform a penance for such (a deed) or if he\nshall not do it. 3\n\n4\\. (Some) declare, that he shall not do it,\n\np. 275\n\n5\\. Because the deed does not perish. 5\n\n6\\. The most excellent (opinion is), that he shall perform (a penance). 6\n\n7\\. For it is declared in the Veda, that he who has offered a Punastoma (may)\nagain come to (partake of) the libations of Soma, 7\n\n8\\. Likewise he who has offered a Vratyastoma. 8\n\n9\\. (The Veda says) further: \'He who offers a horse-sacrifice, conquers all\nsin, he destroys the guilt of the murder of a Brahma _n_ a; 9\n\n10\\. Moreover: \'He shall make an Abhi _s_ asta perform an Agnish _t_ ut\nsacrifice.\' 10\n\n11\\. Reciting the Veda, austerity, a sacrifice, fasting, giving gifts are the\nmeans for expiating such a (blamable act). 11\n\n12\\. The purificatory (texts are), the Upanishads, the Vedantas, the Sa _m_\nhita-text of all the Vedas, the (Anuvakas called) Madhu, the (hymn of) 12\n\np. 276\n\n[paragraph continues] Aghamarsha _n_ a, the Atharva _s_ iras, the (Anuvakas\ncalled the) Rudras, the Purusha-hymn, the two Samans (called) Ra _g_ ana and\nRauhi _n_ eya, the B _ri_ hat (Saman) and the Rathantara, the Purushagati\n(Saman), the Mahanamnis, the Mahavaira _g_ a (Saman), the Mahadivakirtya\n(Saman), any of the _G_ yesh _th_ a Samans, the Bahishpavamana (Saman), the\nKushma _n_ _d_ as, the Pavamanis, and the Savitri.\n\n13\\. To live on milk alone, to eat vegetables only, to eat fruits only, (to\nlive on) barley-gruel prepared of a handful of grain, to eat gold, to eat\nclarified butter, and to drink Soma (are modes of living) which purify. 13\n\n14\\. All mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, places of pilgrimage, the\ndwellings of _Ri_ shis, cow-pens, and temples of the gods (are) places (which\ndestroy sin). 14\n\np. 277\n\n15\\. Continence, speaking the truth, bathing morning, noon, and evening,\nstanding in wet clothes, sleeping on the ground, and fasting (are the various\nkinds of) austerity. 15\n\n16\\. Gold, a cow, a dress, a horse, land, sesamum, clarified butter, and food\nare the gifts (which destroy sin).\n\n17\\. A year, six months, four (months), three (months), two (months), one\n(month), twenty-four days, twelve days, six days, three days, a day and a\nnight are the periods (for penances).\n\n18\\. These (acts) may be optionally performed when no (particular penance) has\nbeen prescribed, 18\n\n19\\. (Viz.) for great sins difficult (penances), and for trivial faults easy\nones.\n\n20\\. The K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra and the Ati _k_ r.ik _kh_ ra, (as well as) the _K_\nandraya _n_ a, are penances for all (offences). 20\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[274:1](sbe0283.htm#fr_1353) **XIX**. Haradatta, thinks that the object of\nthis Sutra is to assert that in the following chapter the laws given above for\ncastes and orders must be kept in mind. Thus penances like offering a\nPunastoma are not intended for _S_ udras, who have no business with Vedic\nrites, but other penances are. He also states that another commentator\nbelieves that the Sutra is meant to indicate that the following rules refer\nnot merely to those men who belong to castes and orders, but to the Pratilomas\nalso, who have been declared to stand outside the pale of the sacred law.\nHaradatta\'s opinion appears to be preferable.\n\n[274:2](sbe0283.htm#fr_1354) \'Ayam purusha _h_ , "man (in) this (world),"\nindicates the universal soul which is dwelling in the body. Yapya, "vile,"\ni.e. despicable (kutsita).\'--Haradatta.\n\n[274:3](sbe0283.htm#fr_1355) \'They, i.e. the theologians (brahmavadina _h_ ).\'\n--Haradatta.\n\n[275:5](sbe0283.htm#fr_1356) I.e. the guilt (adharma) contracted by the deed\nis not effaced before it has produced its result in the shape of punishment in\nhell and in other births, see also Manu X1, 45.\n\n[275:6](sbe0283.htm#fr_1357) \'Apara, "most excellent," means that which\nnothing surpasses, i.e. the settled doctrine.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[275:7](sbe0283.htm#fr_1358) The Punastoma is one of the _S_ rauta-sacrifices\nbelonging to the class called Ekaha. Regarding its efficacy, see also La _t_\nyayana _S_ rauta-sutra IX, 4, 5.\n\n[275:8](sbe0283.htm#fr_1359) The Vratyastoma is another Ekaha-sacrifice.\nRegarding its efficacy, see Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 38; La _t_ yayana _S_\nrautra-sutra VIII 6, 29.\n\n[275:9](sbe0283.htm#fr_1360) _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a XIII, 3, 1, 1.\n\n[275:10](sbe0283.htm#fr_1361) The Agnish _t_ ut is an Ekaha-sacrifice.\nRegarding its efficacy, see Manu XI, 75.\n\n[275:11](sbe0283.htm#fr_1362) Manu XI, 46, 228; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 26, 12-I, 9,\n27, 11.\n\n[275:12](sbe0283.htm#fr_1363) \'Those parts of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas which are not\n(Upanishads) are called Vedantas. In all the Vedas ( _kh_ andas), i.e. in all\nSakhas (prava _k_ ana), the Sa _m_ hita-text, not the Pada-text, nor the\nKrama-text. Another commentator says, "One Sa _m_ hita is to be made p. 276\nwith all the metres, i.e. the Gayatri and the rest, and to be recited\naccording to the manner of the Prataranuvaka."\'--Haradatta. According to the\nsame authority, the Madhus are found Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 38, the hymn\nof Aghamarsha _n_ a Rig-veda X, 190, the Rudras Taittiriya-Sa _m_ hita IV, 5,\n1-11, and in the corresponding eleven chapters of all other Ya _g_ us-sakhas,\nthe Purushasukta Rig-veda X, 90, the Kushma _n_ _d_ as Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka\nX, 3-5, the Pavamanis Rig-veda IX, while by Atharva _s_ iras the Upanishad,\nknown by that name, is meant. As regards the Samans mentioned in the Sutra it\nsuffices to refer to Professor Benfey\'s Index, Ind. Stud. III, 199, and to Dr.\nBurnell\'s Index of the \xc3\x82rsheya-brahma _n_ a.\n\n[276:13](sbe0283.htm#fr_1364) According to Haradatta the word iti, which\nappears in the text at the end of the enumeration, is intended to include\nother similar kinds of food, as \'the five products of the cow.\' Eating gold\nmeans eating small particles of gold which have been thrown into clarified\nbutter and the like.\n\n[276:14](sbe0283.htm#fr_1365) The word iti used in the text is, according to\nHaradatta, again to be taken in the sense of \'and so forth.\' The translation\nof parishkanda, \'a temple,\' not parishkandha, as Professor Stenzler p. 277\nreads, is based on Haradatta\'s explanation. Etymologically it seems to mean \'a\nplace for circumambulation,\' and to denote the platform on which the temples\nusually stand, and which is used for the Pradakshi _n_ a ceremony.\n\n[277:15](sbe0283.htm#fr_1366) The word iti in the text is explained as in the\npreceding Sutras.\n\n[277:18](sbe0283.htm#fr_1367) These (acts), i.e. the recitation of the Veda\nand so forth, which have been enumerated above, Sutras 11-16.\n\n[277:20](sbe0283.htm#fr_1368) Regarding these penances, see chapters XXVI and\nXXVII. Haradatta again takes the word iti, which occurs in the text, to\ninclude other difficult penances.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XX](sbe0284.htm)\n\n'
