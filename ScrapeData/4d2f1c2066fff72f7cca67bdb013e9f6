But the (denials of) conceptions concerning the\n\np. 239\n\nakshara are to be comprehended (in all meditations on the akshara), on account\nof the equality and of the object being the same, as in the case of the\nupasad; this has been explained (in the Purva Mima _m_ sa).\n\nWe read in the Va _g_ asaneyaka, 'O Gargi, the Brahma _n_ as call this the\nAkshara. It is neither coarse, nor fine, nor short, nor long,' &c. (B _ri_.\nUp. III, 8, 8). Similarly the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a says, 'The higher knowledge is\nthat by which the Indestructible is apprehended. That which cannot be seen nor\nseized, which has no family and no caste,' &c. (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5; 6). In other\nplaces also the highest Brahman, under the name of Akshara, is described as\nthat of which all qualities are to be denied. Now in some places qualities are\ndenied of Brahman which are not denied in other places, and hence a doubt\narises whether the mental conception of these particular denials is to form\npart of all those passages or not.\n\nTo the assertion of the purvapakshin that each denial is valid only for that\npassage in which the text actually exhibits it, we make the following reply.--\nThe conceptions of the akshara, i.e. the conceptions of the particular denials\nconcerning the akshara, are to be included in all those passages, 'on account\nof the equality and on account of the same object being referred to.' The\nequality consists therein that all the texts alluded to convey an idea of\nBrahman in the same way, viz. by denying of it all attributes; and we\nrecognise in all of them the same object of instruction, viz. the one\nundivided Brahman. Why then should the conceptions stated in one passage not\nbe valid for all others also? To the present case the same argumentation\napplies which had been made use of under III, 3, 11. There positive attributes\nwere discussed; here we are concerned with negative ones. The division of the\ndiscussion into two (instead of disposing of positive and negative attributes\nin one adhikara _n_ a) is due to the wish of explaining the differences in\ndetail. The clause, 'as in the case of the upasads,' introduces a parallel\ncase. For\n\np. 240\n\nthe _G_ amadagnya-ahina-sacrifice [1](sbe38177.htm#fn_153) the text enjoins\nthat the upasad offerings are to consist of puro _d_ a _s_ as. Now although\nthe mantras accompanying the offering of the puro _d_ a _s_ as are originally\nenjoined in the Veda of the Udgat _ri_ s (Ta _n_ _d_ ya Bra. XXI, 10, 11,\n'Agni, promote the hotra,' &c.), yet they are to be enounced by the adhvaryu;\nfor the offering of the puro _d_ a _s_ as is the work of the adhvaryu, and\nsubordinate matters (i.e. here, the mantras) are governed by the principal\nmatter (i.e. the offering of the puro _d_ a _s_ a). Similarly, in the case\nunder discussion, the attributes of the akshara have, because they are\nsubordinate to the akshara itself, to be connected with the latter everywhere,\nin whatever places the text may originally state them.--The principle of\ndecision employed is explained in the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras III, 3, 9.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[238:1](sbe38175.htm#fr_152) Api ka nadhikaravata _m_ sarvesham _ri_ shi _n_\nam atmatattva _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana _m_ tenavyapako\xe0\xa4\xbdpy ayam purvapaksha ity aha _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nanantarushu _k_ eti.
