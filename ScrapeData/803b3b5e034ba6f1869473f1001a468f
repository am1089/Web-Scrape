In the\nhome is the true union, in the home is enjoyment of life: why should I forsake\nmy home and wander in the forest? p. 88 If Brahma helps me to realize truth,\nverily I will find both bondage and deliverance in home.  \nHe is dear to me indeed who has power to dive deep into Brahma; whose mind\nloses itself with ease in His contemplation.  \nHe is dear to me who knows Brahma, and can dwell on His supreme truth in\nmeditation; and who can play the melody of the Infinite by uniting love and\nrenunciation in life.  \nKabir says: "The home is the abiding place; in the home is reality; the home\nhelps to attain Him Who is real. So stay where you are, and all things shall\ncome to you in time."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XLI](sok042.htm)\n\n'
