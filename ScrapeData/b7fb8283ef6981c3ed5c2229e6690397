The Upanishads far away in the golden age; in the bright dawn\nthat has faded so many ages ago. Buddha, the Awakened One, who, catching in\nhis clear spirit the glow of that early dawn, sought to reflect it in the\nhearts of all men, of whatever race, of whatever nation; sought to break down\nthe barriers of caste and priestly privilege; to leave each man alone with the\nUniverse, with no mediator between. But scattering abroad the rays of wisdom,\nBuddha found that the genius of each man, of each race, could only reflect one\nlittle beam; and that in thus making the light the property of all men, the\npurity and completeness of the light might be impaired.\n\nThen followed \xc5\x9aankaracharya--\xc5\x9aankara the Teacher--who set himself to the\npreservation of the light; to burnishing the casket that held the lamp of\nwisdom. Busying himself chiefly with India, he saw that the light must be\npreserved, as far as its completeness and perfection were concerned, within\nthe Brahman order, where the advantages of heredity, of ages of high ideals\nand rigid discipline could best secure the purity of the light; could best\nsupply a body of men, fitted by character and training to master the high\nknowledge, to sustain the moral effort that made the glory of India\'s Golden\nAge.\n\np. 4\n\nThis task of fitting the Brahman order to carry the torch of wisdom was\nundertaken by \xc5\x9aankara the Teacher in three ways. First, by commenting on the\nGreat Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, he rendered the knowledge of the\nGolden Age into the thought and language of the Brahmans of his day. Second,\nby writing a series of preparatory works, of catechisms and manuals, he made\nsmooth the path of those who would take the first steps on the path of wisdom.\nThirdly, by a system of reform and discipline within the Brahman order, he did\nall that sound practice could do to second clear precept.\n\nThe system formed by \xc5\x9aankara within the Brahman order largely continues at the\npresent day. The radiant points of this system are the monasteries founded by\nthe Teacher, where a succession of teachers, each initiated by his\npredecessor, carry on the spiritual tradition of the great \xc5\x9aankara unbroken.\n\nOf commentaries on the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, many, perhaps, were\nwritten in a gradual series leading up from the simple truths to the more\nprofound mysteries; so that, with one after another of these treatises in\nhand, the learner was gradually led to the heart of the mystery which lies\n"like a germ of generation" well concealed in these matchless theosophic\ndocuments. These commentaries were followed by others, the work of \xc5\x9aankara\'s\npupils; and though these works of explanation are very numerous, all those\nthat are published seem to belong to the earlier stages of learning, and leave\nthe deeper passages and problems of the Upanishads still unsolved.\n\np. 5\n\nBut the other part of \xc5\x9aankara\'s work, the manuals and catechisms for learners,\nare complete and perfect. They really teach, quite plainly and lucidly, the\nfirst steps on the path of wisdom; they point out, with clear insistence, the\nqualities that are necessary to make these first steps fruitful; qualities\nwithout which the learner may remain, hesitating and halting, on the\nthreshold, through lack of the force and sterling moral worth which alone make\nany further progress possible.\n\nNor are these necessary qualities difficult to understand. They are not queer\npsychic powers that only flatter vanity; they are not mere intellectual tricks\nthat leave the heart cold; they are rather the simple qualities of sterling\nhonesty, of freedom from selfishness and sensuality--which have formed the\nbasis of every moral code; the virtues so common and commonplace on the lips,\nbut not quite so common in the life and character.\n\nThese treatises of \xc5\x9aankara speak to the common understanding and moral sense\nin an unparalleled degree. They are an appeal to the reason that has hardly\never been equalled for clearness and simplicity by the sages of the earth.\nTheir aim is Freedom (Moksha), "Freedom from the bondage of the world." This\naim speaks to every one, awakens an echo in every heart, appeals to the\nuniversal hope of common humanity.\n\nBut it is not enough for the mind to follow the lucid sentences of \xc5\x9aankara.\n"Freedom from the bondage of the world" demands something more. "Sickness is\nnot cured by saying \'Medicine,\' but by drinking it; so a man is not set free\nby the name of the Eternal, but by\n\np. 6\n\ndiscerning the Eternal." The teaching must be woven into life and character if\nit is to bear fruit; it is not enough to contemplate the virtue of freedom\nfrom selfishness and sensuality in the abstract.\n\nOne of these treatises, "The Crest-jewel of Wisdom," will be translated here.\nIt will be divided according to the natural sections of the text, beginning\nwith the first steps on the path and ending with the complete teaching of\n\xc5\x9aankara\'s philosophy so far as that teaching can be put into words. Hardly any\nnotes will be necessary, as the language of the teacher is lucidity itself.\nEvery word is defined and every definition enlarged and repeated.\n\nIt is not, however, the object of these papers to put forward a presentation\nof eastern thought merely to be read and forgotten. We shall spare no pains of\nrepetition and amplification to make the thoughts of the East quite clear. But\nmuch remains to be done by readers themselves. They must make the thoughts of\n\xc5\x9aankara and the sages their own spiritual property if they are to benefit by\nthem, and as a preliminary for this first chapter of \xc5\x9aankara\'s teaching, the\n"four Perfections" should be learned by heart and taken to heart.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: First Steps on the Path](cjw05.htm)\n\n'
