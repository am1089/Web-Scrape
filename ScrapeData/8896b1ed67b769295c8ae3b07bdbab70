The Muni said :-- O King! The powerful Asura Mahi _s_ a, born of a she-\nbuffalo, defeated all the Devas and became the Lord of the whole universe.\nThat indomitable Danava seized forcibly all\n\n\n\np. 1041\n\nthe rights of the Devas and began to enjoy the pleasures of the kingdom over\nthe three worlds. The Devas, thus defeated, were expelled from their abodes in\nHeavens. They took Brahma as their Leader and went to the excellent regions\nwhere Maha Deva and Vi _sn_ u resided and informed them of all that had been\ndone by that vicious Asura Mahi _s_ a. They said :-- \xc2\x93O Deva of the Devas! The\ninsolent Mahi _s_ asura has become unbearable and he has taken possessions of\nthe rights and properties of the whole host of the Devas and he is now\nenjoying them. Both of you are quite capable to destroy the Asura. So why do\nyou not devise means to annihilate him in no time!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n7-10. Hearing these pitiful words of the Devas, Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u became\nquite indignant. S\xc2\x92ankara, Brahma and the other Devas all were inflamed with\nanger. O King! From the face of the angry Hari, then emanated an Unusual Fire,\nbrilliant like thousand Suns. Then by and by emanated fires also from the\nbodies of all the Devas who were filled then with joy. From the mass of fire\nthus emanated there came out a beautiful Female Figure. The face of this\nfigure was formed out of the fire that emanated from the body of Maha Deva.\nHer hairs were formed out of the fire of Yama and Her arms were formed out of\nthe fire that emanated from Vi _sn_ u.\n\n\n\n11-21. O King! From the fire of the Moon came out two breasts; from the fire\nof Indra came out Her middle portion; from the fire of Varu _n_ a, appeared\nHer loins and thighs; from the fire of Earth, Her hips were formed; from the\nfire of Brahma, Her feet were formed; from the fire of the Sun, Her toes were\nformed; from the fire of the Vasus, Her fingers were formed; from Kuvera's\nfire, Her nose came out; from the excellent tejas of Prajapati, teeth; from\nthe fire of Agni, Her three eyes; from the fire of the twilights, Her eye-\nbrows and from the fire of Vayu, Her ears appeared.\n\n\n\nO Lord of men! Thus Bhagavati Mahi _s_ amardini was born of the Tejas (fiery\nsubstances) of the Devas. Next S\xc2\x92iva gave Her the S\xc2\x92ula (weapon spear); Vi\n_sn_ u gave Sudars'ana (Chakra); Varu _n_ a gave the conchshell; Fire gave\nS'akti (weapon); Vayu gave Her bows and arrows; Indra gave Her thunder bolt\nand the bell of the elephant Airavata; Yama gave Her the Destruction Staff\n(Kala Da _nd_ a); Brama gave Her the Rudrak _s_ a, rosary and Kama _nd_ alu;\nthe Sun gave Her, in every pore the wonderful rays; the Time (Kala) gave Her\nsharp axe and shield; the oceans gave Her the beautiful necklace and new\nclothes (two in number); Vis'vakarma gladly gave Her the crown, ear-rings,\n\n\n\np. 1042\n\n\n\nka _t_ aka, Angada, Chandrardha, tinklets; and the Himalayas gave Her the Lion\nas Her Vehicle and various gems and jewels.\n\n\n\n22-30. Kuvera, the Lord of wealth gave Her the cup filled with the drink;\nBhagavan Ananta Deva gave Her a necklace of snakes (Naghara). Thus the World\nMother, the Devi, became honoured by all the Devas. The Devas, very much\noppressed by Mahi _s_ asura, then, chanted various hymns of praise to the\nWorld Mother Mahes'vari Maha Devi.\n\n\n\nHearing their Stotras, the Deves'i, worshipped by the Devas, shouted aloud the\nWar-Cry. O King! Mahi _s_ asura, startled at that War-Cry, came to Bhagavati\nwith all his army corps. Then that great Asura Mahi _s_ a hurled various\nweapons in the air and overcast the sky with them and began to fight with\ngreat skill. The several generals Chik _s_ ura, Durdhara, Durmukha, Va _s_\nkala, Tamraka, Vi _d_ alak _s_ a and various other innumerable generals as if\nDeath incarnate, accompanied Mahi _s_ a, the chief Danava. A fierce fight then\nensued. Then the Devi Who enchants all the beings, became red-eyed with anger\nand began to kill the generals of the against party. When the generals were\nkilled one by one Mahi _s_ asura, skilled in the science of magic, came up\nquickly to the front of the Devi.\n\n\n\n31-40. The Lord of the Danavas, then, by his magic power, began to assume\nvarious forms. Bhagavati, too, began to destroy his those forms. Then the\nDaitya, the crusher of the Devas, assumed the form of a buffalo and began to\nfight. The Devi then fastened the animal, the Asura, the Death of the Devas,\ntightly and cut off his head by Her axe. The remainder of his forces, then,\nfled away in terror and disorder with a loud cry. The Devas became very glad\nand began to chant hymns to the Devi. O King! Thus the Lak _s_ mi Devi\nappeared to kill Mahi _s_ asura. Now I will describe how Sarasvati appeared.\nListen. Once on a time the two very powerful Daityas S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis'umbha\nwere born. They attacked the Devas, oppressed them and seized their houses and\nrights. The Devas became dispossessed of their kingdoms and went to the\nHimalayas and offered stotras to the Devi with the greatest devotion :-- \xc2\x93O\nDeves\xc2\x92i! O Thou, skilled in removing the difficulties of the Bhaktas! Victory\nto Thee! O Thou, the Sinless One! Old age and death cannot touch Thee. O Thou!\nDeath incarnate to the Danavas! O Deves\xc2\x92i! O Thou, of mighty valour and\nprowess! O Thou, the embodiment of Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes'a! Unbounded is\nThy might; Thou canst be easily reached by the power of devo-\n\n\n\np. 1043\n\n\n\ntion. O Thou, the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer! O Madhavi! O Thou, the\nGiver of Bliss! Thou dancest with great joy at the time of the dissolution of\nall the things (Pralaya).\n\n\n\n41-50. O Thou, full of mercy! O Deva Deves\xc2\x92i! Be gracious unto us. O Thou, the\nRemover of the sufferings of the refugees! We now come unto Thy protection.\nThe terror of S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis'umbha is like an endless ocean unto us. Save,\nsave us from their fast clutches. O Devi! save us O King! verily.\xc2\x94 When the\nDevas praised thus, the daughter of the Himalayas, Bhagavati became pleased\nand asked \xc2\x93What is the matter?\xc2\x94 In the meanwhile, there emitted from the\nphysical sheath of the Devi another Devi Kaus'iki who gladly spoke to the\nDevas :-- \xc2\x93O Suras! I am pleased with Thy Stotra. Now ask the boon that you\ndesire.\xc2\x94 The Devas then asked for the following boon :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! The two\nfamous Daityas S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis'umbha have attacked forcibly the three worlds.\nThe wicked Lord of the Danavas, S\xc2\x92umbha, has overcome us by the power of his\narm and is now tormenting us without any break. Kindly devise some means to\nkill him.\xc2\x94 The Devi said :-- \xc2\x93O Devas! Be patient. I will kill these two\nDaityas, S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis'umbha and thus remove the thorn on your way. At an\nearly date I will do good to you.\xc2\x94 Thus saying to Indra and the other Devas\nthe merciful Devi disappeared at once before their eyes. The Deva with their\nhearts delighted went to the beautiful Sumeru Mountain and dwelt there in the\ncaves thereof.\n\n\n\nHere the servants of S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis'umbha Cha _nd_ a and Mu _nd_ a, while\nthey were making their circuits, saw the exquisitely beautiful Devi, the\nEnchantress of the world, and came back to S\xc2\x92umbha their King and said :--\n\n\n\n51-60. \xc2\x93O Destroyer of enemies! O Giver of honour! O Greal King! You are the\nLord of all the Daityas and are fit to enjoy all the gems and jewels. To-day\nwe have seen an extraordinary beautiful woman jewel. She is fit to be enjoyed\nby you. So now you would better bring that perfectly beautiful woman and\nenjoy. No such enchanting women can be seen amongst the Asura women Naga\nKanyas Gandharbha women, Danavis or men.\xc2\x94 Hearing thus the words of the\nservant, S\xc2\x92umbha, the tormentor of the foes, sent a Daitya named Sugriva as a\nmessenger to Her. The messenger went to the Devi as early as possible and\nspoke to Her all that S\xc2\x92umbha had told him. \xc2\x93O Devi! The Asura S\xc2\x92umbha is now\nthe conqueror of the three worlds and respected by the Devas. O Devi!\n\n\n\np. 1044\n\n\n\nHe is now enjoying all that is best, the gems and jewels; O Devi! I am his\nmessenger sent here to convey to you his message as follows :-- O Devi! I am\nthe sole enjoyer of all the jewels. O Beautiful-eyed! You are a gem; so you\nwould worship me. O Fair One! All the gems and jewels that are in the Deva\nloka, in the Daitya loka, or amongst the regions of men, are under my control.\nSo you would lovingly worship me.\xc2\x94 The Devi said :-- \xc2\x93O Messenger! True that\nyou are speaking for your King; but I made a promise before, how can I act\nagainst it? O Messenger! Hear what I promised.\n\n\n\n61-70. Whoever in the three worlds will conquer Me by sheer force and thus\ncrush My vanity, whoever will be as strong as Myself, He can enjoy Me. So the\nKing of Daityas can prove My promise true and by sheer force can marry Me.\nWhat is there with him that he cannot do? So, Messenger! Go back to your\nmaster and tell him all this so that the powerful S\xc2\x92umbha may fulfil My\npromise.\xc2\x94 Hearing thus the words of the Great Devi, the messenger went back to\nS\xc2\x92umbba and informed him everything regarding the Devi's sayings. The very\npowerful Lord of the Daityas, S\xc2\x92umbha became very angry at the unpleasant\nwords of the messenger and commanded the Daitya named Dhumrak _s_ a :-- \xc2\x93O\nDhumrak _s_ a! Listen to my words with great attention. Go and catch hold of\nthat wicked woman by her hairs and bring her to me. Go quickly; do not delay.\xc2\x94\nThus commanded, the very powerful and the best of the Daityas, Dhumrak _s_ a,\nwent at once to the Devi with sixty thousand Daityas and cried aloud to Her\n:--\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93O Auspicious One! You would better worship quickly our Lord S\xc2\x92umbha, who is\nvery powerful and mighty; you will then acquire all sorts of pleasures; else I\nwill hold you by your hairs and take you to the Lord of the Daityas.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n71-80. Thus addressd by Dhumrak _s_ a Daitya, the enemy of the Devas, the Devi\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O Powerful One! O Daitya! What you have spoken is perfectly right,\nbut tell me first what you or your king S\xc2\x92umbha can do to Me?\xc2\x94 When the Devi\nsaid thus, the Daitya Dhumralochana rushed on Her at once with arms and\nweapons. With one loud noise, Mahes'vari burnt him immediately to ashes. O\nKing! The other forces were partly crushed by the Lion, the vehicle of the\nDevi and partly fled away in disorder to all the quarters; some became\nsenseless out of fear. S\xc2\x92umbba , the Lord of the Daityas, became very angry to\nhear this. His face assumed a terrible form with eyebrows contracted. Then he\nbecame impatient with anger and sent in order Cha _nd_ a, Mu _nd_ a and\nRaktabija.\n\n\n\np. 1045\n\n\n\nThe three powerful Daityas went to the battle and tried their might to capture\nthe Devi. The Devi Jagaddhatri, of violent prowess, seeing that these three\nDaityas were coming to Her, killed them by Her trident and laid them prostrate\non the ground. Hearing their death with all their army, S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis'umbha\ncame in their own persons arrogantly to the battlefield. S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis'umbha\nfought for a time with the Devi a terrible fight and became tired, when the\nDevi killed them outright. When the Bhagavati, Who is all this world, killed\nS\xc2\x92umbba and Nis'umbha, the Devas began to praise Bhagavati the Supreme Deity\nof Vak (Word) incarnate.\n\n\n\n81-93. O King! Thus I have spoken to you in due order the manner in which the\nbeautiful Kali, Maha Lak _s_ mi and Sarasvati incarnated themselves on the\nearth. That Supreme Deity, the Devi Parames'vari thus creates, preserves, and\ndestroys the Universe. You better take refuge of that highly adored Devi, that\ncauses the distinction and the delusion of this Universe. Then only you will\nattain success. Naraya _n_ a said :-- The king Suratha, hearing these\nbeautiful words of the Muni, took refuge of the Devi, that yields all desired\nobjects. He built an earthen image of the Devi and, with concentrated\nattention, thought wholly of the Devi and began to worship Her with devotion.\nWhen the worship was over, he offered sacrifices of the blood of his body to\nthe Devi. Then the World-Mother, the Deity of the Devas, became pleased and\nappeared before him and asked him :-- Accept the boon that you desire. When\nthe Devi said thus, the king asked from the Mahes'vari that excellent\nknowledge whereby the ignorance is destroyed and as well the kingdom free from\nany dangers or difficulties. The Devi said :-- \xc2\x93O King! By My boon, you will\nget your foeless kingdom in this very birth as well as the J\xc3\xb1anam that removes\nignorance. O King! I will tell you also what you will be in the next birth.\nHear. In your next birth, you will be the son of the Sun and be famous as\nSavar _n_ i Manu. By My boon you will be the Lord of the Manvantara, become\nvery powerful and you will get good many sons.\xc2\x94 Thus granting him this boon,\nthe Devi disappeared. By the Grace of the Devi, Suratha became the Lord of the\nManvantara. O Sadhu! Thus I have described to you the birth and deeds of Savar\n_n_ i. He who hears or reads this anecdote with devotion, will be a favourite\nof the Devi.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twelfth Chapter of the Tenth Book on the anecdote of Savar _n_ i\nManu in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar\n_s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 13](bk10ch13.htm)\n\n"
