[1](ry378.htm#fn_872)  \n   Swift rose before her startled eyes  \nThe Vanar in his native size,  \nLike Mandar's hill or Meru's height,  \nEncircled with a blaze of light.  \n'O come,' he cried, 'thy fears dispel,  \nNor doubt that I will bear thee well.  \nCome, in my strength and care confide,  \nAnd sit in joy by Rama's side.'  \n   Again she spake: 'I know thee now,  \nBrave, resolute, and strong art thou;  \nIn glory like the Lord of Fire  \nWith storm-swift feet which naught may tire  \nBut yet with thee I may not fly:  \nFor, borne so swiftly through the sky,  \nMine eyes would soon grow faint and dim,  \nMy dizzy brain would reel and swim,  \nMy yielding arms relax their hold,  \nAnd I in terror uncontrolled  \nShould fall into the raging sea  \nWhere hungry sharks would feed on me.  \nNor can I touch, of free accord,  \nThe limbs of any save my lord.  \nIf, by the giant forced away,  \nIn his enfolding arms I lay,  \nNot mine, O Vanar, was the blame;  \nWhat could I do, a helpless dame?  \nGo, to my lord my message bear,  \nAnd bid him end my long despair.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[415:1b](ry377.htm#fr_869) Vibhishan is the wicked Ravan's good brother.\n\n[415:2b](ry377.htm#fr_870) Her name is Kala, or in the Bengal recension Nanda.\n\n[415:3b](ry377.htm#fr_871) One of Ravan's chief councillors.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXVIII.: Sita's Gem.](ry378.htm)\n\n"
