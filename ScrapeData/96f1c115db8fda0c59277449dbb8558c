Those who, resorting to this knowledge, reach assimilation with my\nessence, are not born at the creation, and are not afflicted 1 at the\ndestruction (of the universe). The great Brahman 2 is a womb for me, in which\nI cast the seed. From that, O descendant of Bharata! is the birth of all\nthings. Of the bodies, O son of Kunti! which are born from all wombs, the\n(main) womb is the great Brahman, and I (am) the father, the giver of the\nseed. Goodness, passion, darkness, these qualities 3 born from nature, O you\nof mighty arms! bind down the inexhaustible soul in the body. Of these,\ngoodness, which, in consequence of being untainted, is enlightening and free\nfrom (all) misery, binds the soul, O sinless one! with the bond of pleasure\nand the bond of knowledge 4. Know that passion consists in being enamoured,\nand is produced from craving and attachment. That, O son of Kunti! binds down\nthe embodied (self) with the\n\np. 108\n\nbond of action. Darkness (you must) know to be born of ignorance, it deludes\nall embodied (selfs). And that, O descendant of Bharata! binds down (the self)\nwith heedlessness 1, indolence, and sleep. Goodness unites (the self) with\npleasure; passion, O descendant of Bharata! with action; and darkness with\nheedlessness, after shrouding up knowledge. Passion and darkness being\nrepressed, goodness stands, O descendant of Bharata! Passion and goodness\n(being repressed), darkness; and likewise darkness and goodness (being\nrepressed), passion 2. When in this body at all portals 3 light (that is to\nsay) knowledge prevails, then should one know goodness to be developed.\nAvarice, activity 4, performance of actions, want of tranquillity, desire,\nthese are produced, O chief of the descendants of Bharata! when passion is\ndeveloped. Want of light, want of activity 5, heedlessness, and delusion,\nthese are produced, O descendant of Kuru! when darkness is developed. When an\nembodied (self) encounters death, while goodness is developed, then he reaches\nthe untainted worlds of those who know the highest 6. Encountering death\nduring (the prevalence\n\np. 109\n\nof) passion, he is born among those attached to action. Likewise, dying during\n(the prevalence of) darkness, he is born in the wombs of the ignorant 1. The\nfruit of meritorious action is said to be good, untainted; while the fruit of\npassion is misery; and the fruit of darkness ignorance. From goodness is\nproduced knowledge, from passion avarice 2, and from darkness heedlessness and\ndelusion and ignorance also. Those who adhere to (the ways of) goodness go up\n3; the passionate remain in the middle; while those of the qualities of\ndarkness, adhering to the ways of the lowest quality, go down. When a right-\nseeing person sees none but the qualities (to be) the doers (of all action),\nand knows what is above the qualities 4, he enters into my essence. The\nembodied (self), who transcends these three qualities, from which bodies are\nproduced 5, attains immortality, being freed from birth and death and old age\nand misery.\n\nAr _g_ una said:\n\nWhat are the characteristics, O lord! of one who has transcended these three\nqualities? What is his conduct, and how does he transcend these three\nqualities 6?\n\np. 110\n\nThe Deity said:\n\nHe is said to have transcended the qualities, O son of Pandu! who is not\naverse to light and activity and delusion (when they) prevail, and who does\nnot desire (them when they) cease 1; who sitting like one unconcerned is never\nperturbed by the qualities 2; who remains steady and moves 3 not, (thinking)\nmerely that the qualities 4 exist; who is self-contained 5; to whom pain and\npleasure are alike; to whom a sod and a stone and gold are alike; to whom what\nis agreeable and what is disagreeable are alike; who has discernment; to whom\ncensure and praise of himself are alike; who is alike in honour and dishonour;\nwho is alike towards the sides of friends and foes; and who abandons all\naction 6. And he who worships me with an unswerving devotion, transcends these\nqualities, and becomes fit for (entrance into) the essence of the Brahman. For\nI am the embodiment of the Brahman 7, of indefeasible immortality, of eternal\npiety, and of unbroken happiness.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[106:1](sbe0815.htm#fr_442) Not to have true knowledge, is equivalent to self-\ndestruction. Cf. \xc3\x8e _s_ opanishad, pp. 9, 15, 16.\n\n[106:2](sbe0815.htm#fr_443) I. e. absorbed at the time of the deluge in\nnature, one of the energies of the supreme; 'emanating,' i.e. at the time of\ncreation.\n\n[106:3](sbe0815.htm#fr_444) Nature, which is the material cause from which all\nentities are produced; the destruction of it results from true knowledge of\nthe soul. See the third note on p. 107 infra.\n\n[107:1](sbe0816.htm#fr_445) I. e. 'are not destroyed,' Madhusudana; 'do not\nfall,' _S_ a _n_ kara; are not born,' _S_ ridhara, and apparently Ramanu _g_\na.\n\n[107:2](sbe0816.htm#fr_446) I. e. the 'nature' spoken of before.\n\n[107:3](sbe0816.htm#fr_447) These constitute nature. We must understand\nnature, with Professor Bha _nd_ arkar, as the hypothetical cause of the soul's\nfeeling itself limited and conditioned. If nature is understood, as it usually\nis, to mean matter, its being made up of the qualities is inexplicable.\nInterpreted idealistically, as suggested by Professor Bha _nd_ arkar, the\ndestruction of it spoken of at the close of the last chapter also becomes\nintelligible. By means of knowledge of the soul, the unreality of these\nmanifestations is understood and nature is destroyed.\n\n[107:4](sbe0816.htm#fr_448) Pleasure and knowledge appertain to the mind, not\nthe self, hence they are described as constituting bonds, when erroneously\nconnected with the self, _S_ a _n_ kara and _S_ ridhara. They constitute\n'bonds,' because the self when brought into contact with them, strives to\nobtain them, Ramanu _g_ a.\n\n[108:1](sbe0816.htm#fr_449) Carelessness about duty, owing to being intent on\nsomething else. Cf. Sutta Nipata, pp. 51-91; Dhammapada. stanza 21; Ka _th_\nopanishad, p. 152.\n\n[108:2](sbe0816.htm#fr_450) The effects of each quality assert themselves,\nwhen the other two are held in check.\n\n[108:3](sbe0816.htm#fr_451) I. e. the senses of perception.\n\n[108:4](sbe0816.htm#fr_452) Activity = always doing something or another;\nperformance, &c. = rearing large mansions, &c. want of tranquillity =\nperpetual agitation of mind, 'this I will do now, then, that, and next the\nother;' desire = to obtain everything that one comes across.\n\n[108:5](sbe0816.htm#fr_453) I. e. doing absolutely nothing.\n\n[108:6](sbe0816.htm#fr_454) The highest manifestations of Brahman, viz. the\nHira _n_ yagarbha, &c., say _S_ ridhara and Madhusudana. Nilaka _nth_ a also\nsuggests that 'those who know the highest' means gods.\n\n[109:1](sbe0816.htm#fr_455) Lower creation, such as birds, beasts, &c.\n\n[109:2](sbe0816.htm#fr_456) Cf. Sutta Nipata, p. 16.\n\n[109:3](sbe0816.htm#fr_457) I. e. are born as gods, &c., middle,' as men, &c.;\n'down,' as brutes, &c.\n\n[109:4](sbe0816.htm#fr_458) I. e. what has been called Kshetrag\xc3\xb1a before, the\nsupervising principle within one.\n\n[109:5](sbe0816.htm#fr_459) Bodies are developments of the qualities, say the\ncommentators, which is not incompatible with the explanation of qualities\ngiven above. As to transcending qualities, cf. [p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48)\nsupra.\n\n[109:6](sbe0816.htm#fr_460) Cf. as to what follows what is said in chapter II\nabout 'one whose mind is steady.'\n\n[110:1](sbe0816.htm#fr_461) I. e. who does not feel troubled, for instance,\nthinking now I am actuated by a motive of passion or darkness, and so forth.\n\n[110:2](sbe0816.htm#fr_462) So as to lose all discrimination.\n\n[110:3](sbe0816.htm#fr_463) I. e. from his determination to pursue truth, by\nworldly pleasures or pains.\n\n[110:4](sbe0816.htm#fr_464) Cf. [p. 55](sbe0805.htm#page_55) supra.\n\n[110:5](sbe0816.htm#fr_465) Intent on the self only.\n\n[110:6](sbe0816.htm#fr_466) For the whole passage, cf. [p.\n101](sbe0814.htm#page_101) supra.\n\n[110:7](sbe0816.htm#fr_467) Nilaka _nth_ a interprets this to mean 'the\nultimate object of the Vedas.' I here K _ri_ sh _n_ a. _S_ ridhara suggests\nthis parallel, as light embodied is the sun, so is the Brahman embodied\nidentical with Vasudeva.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XV](sbe0817.htm)\n\n"
