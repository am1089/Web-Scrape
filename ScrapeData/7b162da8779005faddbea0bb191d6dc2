And those two (paths) are, with a view to the Yogins, mentioned as to be\nremembered.\n\nThe text quoted does not state an injunction for those about to die, of a\nspecial time of death; but there are rather mentioned in it those two matters\nbelonging to Sm _ri_ ti and therefore to be remembered, viz. the two paths--\nthe path of the Gods and the path of the Fathers--with a view to those who\nknow and practise Yoga; the text intimating that Yogins should daily think of\nthose paths which are included in Yoga meditation. In agreement herewith the\ntext concludes, 'Knowing these two paths no Yogin is ever deluded. Hence in\nall times, O Ar _g_ una, be engaged in Yoga' (Bha. Gi. VIII, 27). Through the\nterms 'the fire, the light,' 'the smoke, the night,' &c. the path of the Gods\nand the path of the Fathers are recognised. Where, in the beginning, the text\nrefers to\n\np. 743\n\n[paragraph continues] 'the time when,' the word 'time' must be understood to\ndenote the divine beings ruling time, since Fire and the rest cannot be time.\nWhat the Bha. Gi. aims at therefore is to enjoin on men possessing true\nknowledge the remembrance of that path of the Gods originally enjoined in the\ntext, 'they go to light' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 15, 10); not to determine the proper\ntime of dying for those about to die.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of\n'the southern progress.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Third Pada: 1.
