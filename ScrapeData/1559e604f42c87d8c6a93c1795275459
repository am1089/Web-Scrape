[1894], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n5:3:2\n\n### SECOND BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n5:3:2:11\\. After the 'jewels' he offers (a pap) to Soma and Rudra. It is\ncooked in milk from a white (cow) which has a white calf. And as to why, after\nthe 'jewels,' he offers (a pap) to Soma and Rudra.\n\n5:3:2:22\\. Now, once upon a time, Svarbhanu, the \xc3\x82sura, struck the sun with\ndarkness, and stricken with darkness he did not shine 2. Soma and Rudra\n\np. 66\n\nremoved that darkness of his; and freed from evil he burns yonder. And in like\nmanner does that (king) thereby enter darkness,--or darkness enters him,--when\nhe puts those unworthy of sacrifice 1 in contact with the sacrifice; and he\ndoes indeed now put those unworthy of sacrifice--either _S_ udras or whomever\nelse--in contact with the sacrifice. It is Soma and Rudra who remove that\ndarkness of his; and freed from evil he becomes consecrated. And as to why it\nis cooked in milk from a white (cow) which has a white calf,--darkness is\nblack: that darkness he removes. The sacrificial fee for this (oblation) is a\nwhite (cow) which has a white calf.\n\n5:3:2:33\\. Even he who, while being qualified for fame, is not yet famous, may\nperform that offering. Now he who is learned (in the Veda), while being\nqualified for fame, is not famous; and he who is not famous, is covered with\ndarkness: that darkness of his Soma and Rudra thereby remove; and freed from\nevil he becomes a very light by his prosperity and renown.\n\n5:3:2:44\\. Thereupon he prepares a pap for Mitra and B _ri_ haspati 2. For\nverily he who departs from the\n\np. 67\n\npath of the sacrifice stumbles; and he does indeed depart from the path of the\nsacrifice, when he puts those unworthy of sacrifice in contact with the\nsacrifice, and he does indeed now put those unworthy of sacrifice--either _S_\nudras or whomever else--in contact with the sacrifice. And the path of the\nsacrifice is Mitra and B _ri_ haspati; for Mitra is the Brahman, and the\nBrahman is the sacrifice; and B _ri_ haspati is the Brahman, and the Brahman\nis the sacrifice. Thus he, returns again to the path of the sacrifice; and as\nsoon as he has returned to the path of the sacrifice he is consecrated:\ntherefore he prepares a pap for Mitra and B _ri_ haspati.\n\n5:3:2:55\\. The course of this (is as follows). Any a _s_ vattha branch broken\noff by itself, either on the eastern or on the northern side (of the tree),\nfrom that he makes a vessel (to hold the pap) for Mitra; for that which is\nhewn by the axe belongs to Varu _n_ a; but that which is broken off by itself\nbelongs to Mitra: therefore he makes the vessel for Mitra from a branch broken\noff by itself.\n\n5:3:2:66\\. Thereupon having curdled the (milk into) curds, and poured it into\na leathern bag; and having put (the horses) to the cart, and fastened (the bag\non the cart), he tells it to 'fly away.' This is that (kind of) fresh butter\nwhich is self-produced 1; for that which is churned belongs to Varu _n_ a, and\nthat which is self-produced belongs to Mitra: therefore it is self-produced\nbutter.\n\n5:3:2:77\\. They divide the rice-grains into two parts: the smaller and broken\nones belong to B _ri_ haspati,\n\np. 68\n\nand the larger and unbroken ones to Mitra. For Mitra injures no one, nor does\nany one injure Mitra; neither a ku _s_ a stalk nor a thorn pricks him, nor has\nhe any scar; for Mitra is every one's friend (mitram).\n\n5:3:2:88\\. He then puts the pap for B _ri_ haspati on (the fire), covers it\nwith the vessel for Mitra's (pap), pours the butter (into the latter), and\nthrows in the (larger) rice-grains. It is cooked merely by the hot steam\n[1](sbe4115.htm#fn_143); for what is cooked by fire belongs to Varu _n_ a, and\nwhat is cooked by hot steam belongs to Mitra: therefore it is cooked by hot\nsteam. Making cuttings from both these sacrificial dishes, he says, 'Pronounce\nthe invitatory prayer to Mitra and B _ri_ haspati!' Having called for the _S_\nrausha _t_ , he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Mitra and B _ri_\nhaspati!' and offers as the Vasha _t_ is uttered.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[65:2](sbe4114.htm#fr_139) According to Rig-veda V, 40, 5-9 (cf. _S_ at. Br.\nIV, 3, 4, 23 p. 66 with note) it was Atri who restored the light of the sun.\nProfessor Ludwig (Bohemian Academy of Sciences, Sitzungsber., May, 1885) has\ntried to prove that solar eclipses (partly available for chronological\npurposes) are referred to in this and some other passages of the hymns.\nCompare also Professor Whitney's remarks thereon, Proceedings of Am. Or. Soc.,\nOct. 1885, p. xvii.\n\n[66:1](sbe4114.htm#fr_140) That is, some of those officials of his to whom the\nratna-havis were offered; Saya _n_ a specifying 'the Commander of the army and\nothers' as _S_ udras; and the 'Huntsman and others' as of whatsoever (low)\ncaste.\n\n[66:2](sbe4114.htm#fr_141) According to the Taittiriya ritualists this double\noblation forms part of the diksha, or initiation ceremony (V, 3, 3, 1). See\nTaitt. S., vol. ii, p. 108.\n\n[67:1](sbe4114.htm#fr_142) That is, produced in the leathern bottle without\nfurther direct human agency, and by the mere motion of the cart.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 3, 3.
