For (in the text) of some (the denial of the soul's departure) is clear.\n\nThe assertion that also the soul of him who knows Brahman departs from the\nbody, because the denial states the soul (not the body) to be the point of\ndeparture, cannot be upheld. For we observe that in the sacred text of some\nthere is a clear denial of a departure, the starting-point of which is the\nbody.--The text meant at first records the question asked by \xc3\x82rtabhaga, 'When\nthis man dies, do the vital spirits depart from him or not?' then embraces the\nalternative of non-departure, in the words, No, replied Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya;\nthereupon--anticipating the objection that\n\np. 374\n\na man cannot be dead as long as his vital spirits have not departed--teaches\nthe resolution of the pra _n_ as in the body 'in that very same place they are\nmerged;' and finally, in confirmation thereof, remarks, 'he swells, he is\ninflated, inflated the dead man lies.' This last clause states that swelling,\n&c., affect the subject under discussion, viz. that from which the departure\ntakes place (the 'tasmat' of the former clause), which subject is, in this\nlast clause, referred to by means of the word 'He.' Now swelling and so on can\nbelong to the body only, not to the embodied soul. And owing to its equality\nthereto 1 also the passages, 'from him the vital spirits do not depart;' 'in\nthat very same place they are resolved,' have to be taken as denying a\ndeparture starting from the body, although the chief subject of the passage is\nthe embodied soul. This may be done by the embodied soul and the body being\nviewed as non-different 2. In this way we have to explain the passage if read\nwith the fifth case.--If again the passage is read with the sixth case ('of\nhim the vital spirits do not depart'), it must be understood as denying the\ndeparture of him who knows, as its purport manifestly is to deny a departure\nestablished elsewhere. But what it denies can only be a departure from the\nbody; for what is established (viz. for ordinary men not possessing the\nhighest knowledge) is only the departure (of the soul, &c.) from the body, not\nthe departure (of the pra _n_ as, &c.) from the embodied soul.--Moreover,\nafter the passage, 'Either through the eye or through the skull or through\nother places of the body, him thus departing the pra _n_ a departs after, and\nafter the departing pra _n_ a all pra _n_ as depart,' &c., has at length\ndescribed the departure and transmigration of the soul as belonging to him who\ndoes not know, and after the account of him\n\np. 375\n\nwho does not know has been concluded with the words. 'So much for the man who\nhas desires,' the text designates him who knows as 'he who has no desires;' a\ndesignation which, would be altogether inappropriate if the text wanted to\nestablish departure, &c., for that person also. The passage therefore has to\nbe explained as denying of him who knows the going and departing which are\nestablished for him who does not know. For thus only the designation employed\nby the text has a sense.--And for him who knowing Brahman has become the Self\nof that omnipresent Brahman, and in whom all desires and works have become\nextinct, departing and going are not even possible, as there is not any\noccasion for them. And such texts as 'there he reaches Brahman' (B _ri_. Up.\nIV, 4, 7) indicate the absence of all going and departing.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[374:1](sbe38293.htm#fr_220) I.e. its belonging to the same chapter and\ntreating of the same subject.\n\n[374:2](sbe38293.htm#fr_221) The two being viewed as non-different, the\npronoun (tasmat), which properly denotes the soul, the person, may be used to\ndenote the body.--Abhedopa _k_ are _n_ a dehadehinor dehaparamar _s_ ina\nsarvanamna deha eva param _ri_ sh _t_ a iti.
