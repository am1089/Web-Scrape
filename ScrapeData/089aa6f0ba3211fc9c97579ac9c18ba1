Far away, one whom I love is very sad to-day. His heart calls to mine\nfor help, but though I tell him how I love him, I leave him still uncheered.\nHow is it? I know he thinks towards me, I know I talk with him. Yet I long to\nsee him, and hear him, and comfort him face to face!\n\n\n\nMy child, if this were not so, the sense-life would not be yours, or would not\nhold you. When you have reached that place where the communion of souls is\nenough, you will find that it is more than the knowledge of the senses, faith\nwill already be swallowed up in sight.\n\nBut, oh Mother, what can I now do to ease this craving pain? I prayed for the\nvision of Raghunath *\n\np. 102\n\nand did not know that it meant torture multiplied a thousand fold. When one is\nin trouble oneself, one\'s own little world lies in gloom; outside, the busy\nfeet pass up and down beneath the windows, the birds build nests, and the\nchildren play in the sunshine, as before: but the universe becomes all black\nwhen the beloved suffers.\n\n\n\nCease, My child, from inordinate affection. Give Me your heart, and let Me\ngovern it alone. Be the _witness_ of earth\'s joys and sorrows, sharing them\nnot. Thus only can you keep yourself from entanglement, and attain to peace.\n\n\n\nBut peace for myself, dear Mother, why should I seek? How can I turn a deaf\near to his voice that calls me, adding another pang to the heartache of a\nlife, and go away myself, and be at peace? Give _him_  \n\np. 103\n\nthat inner peace! Let me win it for him, if Thou wilt he kind! But I cannot\nwill to fail him in his need and loneliness, even to gain Thy blessing!\n\n.      .      .      .      .      .\n\nAh foolish one! Every thought of love that you send out to answer his, becomes\na fetter of iron to hold him in life\'s anguish. Hide you yourself in My heart,\nMy child, and he, too, will come home to Me. For your _love\'s_ sake, let your\nvoice cease to be one with the voices of the world. Let it come to him only in\nMine, when that is borne on the south wind at the time of sunset, calling him\ngently to worship at My feet. Let it be one with transcendent love, with\ninfinite freedom. Only thus can you satisfy him. Only by withdrawing yourself\ncan you bring him peace.\n\n.      .      .      .      .      .\n\nMother! I yield. Take me, I pray Thee, into Thine own heart. Let me not look\nback. If Thou wilt call me I shall find my way\n\np. 104\n\nthere, surely, though my eyes now are blind with tears.\n\nAnd for those I love, shall I trust Thy mercy less than I trust mine own?\n\nYet if at the last they seem to stumble, if the foot slip, or Thy voice fail\nthem by the way, promise, dear Mother, once more to wake me from the dream of\nbliss. Cast me out from Thy heart, I beg of Thee, and let those who so need\nThee, go in before to peace!\n\n\n\nSilly, silly child! Like a helpless bird you beat your wings of littleness\nagainst My grace! Look up and laugh! For already the cloud that seemed so\nblack is passing. Already the clasp of hands about the heart is loosened.\n_Two_ souls draw the long breath of strength and relief. The feet of _two_ who\ncome to Me are shod with gladness. The hearts of two beat high, for the\nconquest born of renunciation.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[101:*](ktm07.htm#fr_0) The vision of Raghunath is one of the eight\nperfections. It consists in feeling the sufferings of others as if they were\nour own. Many stories of the saints, especially those of the stigmata, give us\nspecial cases of it. It is told of a Hindu devotee, that when a bullock was\nsmitten cruelly in his presence he screamed and fell down p. 102 fainting; and\nwhen the passers-by ran to his assistance, he was found to bear the marks of\nthe lashes on his own back.\n\nThe allusion here is perhaps to one of the earlier steps in the acquirement of\nthis perfection, when we have a deepened appredation of the pain of those we\nlove.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Story of Kali](ktm08.htm)\n\n'
