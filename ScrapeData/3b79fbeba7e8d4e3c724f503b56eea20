P. Blavatsky in _The Key to Theosophy_ :\n\nTo promote the study of Aryan and other Scriptures, of the World\'s religion\nand sciences, and to vindicate the importance of old Asiatic literature,\nnamely, of the Brahmanical, Buddhist, and Zoroastrian philosophies.\n\nThe translations herein are reprints from the _Oriental Department Papers_\npublished by William Quan Judge in 1894, 1895, and 1896, as well as from\nJudge\'s Magazine, _The Path_. In introducing Charles Johnston, then a member\nof the Theosophical Society, as the translator of the Sanskrit works to be\nproduced in his Oriental Papers, judge writes:\n\nOf his qualifications there is no doubt, as he has had experience in this\nfield, has also for some time been teaching Sanskrit, and brings to the work a\nsincere sympathy with Indian thought as well as devotion to the Society which\nwill without question make the matter furnished of value as well as of\ninterest.\n\nIn \xc5\x9aankaracharya (the blessed teacher) we have an example of the statement\nthat "Masters are living facts." Mankind needs such assurance these days, and\nneeds not only the inspiration of the story of a man who has lived divinely,\nbut also his kindly and strengthening words of wisdom. What greater gift could\nthe Hindu sage have left us than that of a collection of soul-stirring\nthoughts?\n\nFor those who, with hearts fervent with compassion, seek\n\np. vi\n\nthe holy path that brings to birth a \'sage of boundless vision,\'\n\xc5\x9aankaracharya\'s _Crest-Jewel of Wisdom_ will be a practical and inspiring\nguide to life. Its teachings, the shared realizations of an enlightened god-\nman, tell us the laws by which we may \'untie the bonds of unwisdom,\' and thus,\nevermore free, with minds calm and pellucid and hearts purified of reward-\ndesiring actions, come to know and partake of the majestic power, light, and\nuniversal kinship of the Divine within us, our birthright as humans, and our\npassport to grander attainments in vaster spheres of consciousness.\n\nJust as the sun with its splendor and its glories greets us every morning when\nwe awake and silently through the day nourishes us in all parts of our being,\nand later as it sets at night, leaves a glow of rich color suggesting a\nspiritual mystery to be grasped somewhere, somehow--maybe in the morn\'s\nreturning light--so the challenging message of \xc5\x9aankaracharya\'s jewel-thoughts\nbraces the spirits of world-weary ones as they turn to its radiant wisdom.\nThey become illumined by the divine fire permeating its words, and as they\nturn from the study of its verses enriched for another of life\'s experiences,\nthe glow of the gleaned awakenings will become a haunting memory leading them\nback to its precepts for another sunrise and sunset of the spirit.\n\nJUDITH TYBERG\n\n_Theosophical University  \n    March, 1946_     __\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Table of Contents](cjw03.htm)\n\n'
