Or not, on account of difference of subject-matter; as in the case of the\nattribute of being higher than the high, and so on.\n\nThere is no unity of the two vidyas, since the subject-matter of the two\ndiffers. For the tale in the _Kh_ andogya-text, which begins 'when the Devas\nand the Asuras struggled together,' connects itself with the pra _n_ ava (the\nsyllable Om) which is introduced as the object of meditation in _Kh_ and. I,\n1, 1, 'Let a man meditate on the syllable Om as the Udgitha'; and the clause\nforming part of the tale,'they meditated on that chief breath as Udgitha.'\ntherefore refers to a meditation on the pra _n_ ava which is a part only of\nthe Udgitha. In the text of the Va _g_ a-saneyins; on the other hand, there is\nnothing to correspond to the introductory passage which in the _Kh_ andogya-\ntext determines the subject-matter, and the text clearly states that the\nmeditation refers to the whole Udgitha (not only the pra _n_ ava). And this\ndifference of leading subject-matter implies difference of matter enjoined,\nand this again difference of the character of meditation, and hence there is\nno unity of vidyas. Thus the object of meditation for the _Kh_ andogas is the\npra _n_ ava viewed under the form of Pra _n_ a; while for the Va _g_ asaneyins\nit is the Udgatri (who sings the Udgitha), imaginatively identified with Pra\n_n_ a. Nor does there arise, on this latter account, a contradiction between\nthe later and the earlier part of the story of the Va _g_ asaneyins. For as a\nmeditation on the Udgat _ri_ necessarily\n\np. 635\n\nextends to the Udgitha, which is the object of the activity of singing, the\nlatter also helps to bring about the result, viz. the mastering of enemies.--\nThere is thus no unity of vidya, although there may be non-difference of\ninjunction, and so on.--'As in the case of the attribute of being higher than\nthe high,' &c. In one and the same _s_ akha there are two meditations, in each\nof which the highest Self is enjoined to be viewed under the form of the pra\n_n_ ava ( _Kh_. Up. I, 6; I, 9), and in so far the two vidyas are alike. But\nwhile the former text enjoins that the pra _n_ ava has to be viewed under the\nform of a golden man, in the latter he has to be viewed as possessing the\nattributes of being higher than the high, and owing to this difference of\nattributes the two meditations must be held separate ( _a fortiori_ , then,\nthose meditations are separate which have different objects of meditation).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8.
