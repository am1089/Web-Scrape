The Brahma-students say: Is Brahman the cause 1? Whence are we born?\nWhereby do we live, and whither do we go? O ye who know Brahman, (tell us) at\nwhose command we abide, whether in pain or in pleasure?\n\np. 232\n\n2\\. Should time, or nature 1, or necessity, or chance, or the elements be\nconsidered as the cause, or he who is called the person (purusha, vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nanatma)? It cannot be their union either, because that is not self-dependent\n2, and the self also is powerless, because there is (independent of him) a\ncause of good and evil 3.\n\n3\\. The sages, devoted to meditation and concentration, have seen the power\nbelonging to God himself 4, hidden in its own qualities (gu _n_ a). He, being\none, superintends all those causes, time, self, and the rest 5.\n\n4 6. We meditate on him who (like a wheel) has one felly with three tires,\nsixteen ends, fifty spokes, with twenty counter-spokes, and six sets of eight;\n\np. 233\n\nwhose one rope is manifold, who proceeds on three different roads, and whose\nillusion arises from two causes.\n\np. 234\n\n5 1. We meditate on the river whose water consists of the five streams, which\nis wild and winding with its five springs, whose waves are the five vital\nbreaths, whose fountain head is the mind, the course of the five kinds of\nperceptions. It has five whirlpools, its rapids are the five pains; it has\nfifty kinds of suffering, and five branches.\n\n6\\. In that vast Brahma-wheel, in which all things live and rest, the bird\nflutters about, so long as he thinks that the self (in him) is different from\nthe mover (the god, the lord). When he has been blessed by him, then he gains\nimmortality 2.\n\n7\\. But what is praised (in the Upanishads) is the\n\np. 235\n\n[paragraph continues] Highest Brahman, and in it there is the triad 1. The\nHighest Brahman is the safe support, it is imperishable. The Brahma-students\n2, when they have known what is within this (world), are devoted and merged in\nthe Brahman, free from birth 3.\n\n8\\. The Lord (i _s_ a) supports all this together, the perishable and the\nimperishable, the developed and the undeveloped. The (living) self, not being\na lord, is bound 4, because he has to enjoy (the fruits of works); but when he\nhas known the god (deva), he is freed from all fetters.\n\n9\\. There are two, one knowing (i _s_ vara), the other not-knowing ( _g_ iva),\nboth unborn, one strong, the other weak 5; there is she, the unborn, through\nwhom each man receives the recompense of his works 6; and there is the\ninfinite Self (appearing) under all forms, but himself inactive. When a man\nfinds out these three, that is Brahma 7.\n\n10\\. That which is perishable 8 is the Pradhana 9 (the first), the immortal\nand imperishable is Hara 10.\n\np. 236\n\n[paragraph continues] The one god rules the perishable (the pradhana) and the\n(living) self 1. From meditating on him, from joining him, from becoming one\nwith him there is further cessation of all illusion in the end.\n\n11\\. When that god is known, all fetters fall off, sufferings are destroyed,\nand birth and death cease. From meditating on him there arises, on the\ndissolution of the body, the third state, that of universal lordship 2; but he\nonly who is alone, is satisfied 3.\n\n12\\. This, which rests eternally within the self, should be known; and beyond\nthis not anything has to be known. By knowing the enjoyer 4, the enjoyed, and\nthe ruler, everything has been declared to be threefold, and this is Brahman.\n\n13\\. As the form of fire, while it exists in the under-wood 5, is not seen,\nnor is its seed destroyed,\n\np. 237\n\nbut it has to be seized again and again by means of the stick and the under-\nwood, so it is in both cases, and the Self has to be seized in the body by\nmeans of the pra _n_ ava (the syllable Om).\n\n14\\. By making his body the under-wood, and the syllable Om the upper-wood,\nman, after repeating the drill of meditation, will perceive the bright god,\nlike the spark hidden in the wood 1.\n\n15\\. As oil in seeds, as butter in cream, as water in (dry) river-beds 2, as\nfire in wood, so is the Self seized within the self, if man looks for him by\ntruthfulness and penance 3;\n\n16\\. (If he looks) for the Self that pervades everything, as butter is\ncontained in milk, and the roots whereof are self-knowledge and penance. That\nis the Brahman taught by the Upanishad.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[231:1](sbe15100.htm#fr_703) This translation seems the one which _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara\nhimself prefers, for on p. 277, when recapitulating, he says, kim brahma kara\n_n_ a _m_ ahosvit kaladi. In comparing former translations, whether by Weber,\nRoer, Gough, and others, it will be seen that my own differs considerably from\nevery one of them, and differs equally from _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's interpretation. It\nwould occupy too much space to criticise former translations, nor would it\nseem fair, considering how long ago they were made, and how imperfect were the\nmaterials which were then accessible. All I wish my readers to understand is\nthat, if I differ from my predecessors, I do so after having carefully\nexamined their renderings. Unfortunately, Roer's edition of both the text and\nthe commentary is often far from correct. Thus in the very first verse of the\n_S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad, I think we ought to read sampratish _th_ a _h_\n, instead of sampratish _th_ ita _h_. In the commentary the reading is right.\nVyavasyam is a misprint for vyavastham. In the second verse we must separate\nkala _h_ and svabhava _h_. Yad _ri_ _kh_ _h_ a no very unusual word, meaning\nchance, was formerly taken for a name of the moon! Instead of na tvatmabhavat,\nboth sense and metre require that we should read anatmabhavat, though the\ncommentators take a different view. They say, because there is a self, and\nthen go on to say that even that would not suffice. Such matters, however,\nbelong to a critical commentary on the Upanishads rather than to a\ntranslation, and I can refer to them in cases of absolute necessity only, and\nwhere the readings of the two MSS., A. and B, seem to offer some help.\n\n[232:1](sbe15100.htm#fr_704) Svabhava, their own nature or independent\ncharacter.\n\n[232:2](sbe15100.htm#fr_705) Union presupposes a uniter.\n\n[232:3](sbe15100.htm#fr_706) \xc3\x82tma is explained by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara as the _g_ iva\n_h_ , the living self, and as that living self is in his present state\ndetermined by karman, work belonging to a former existence, it cannot be\nthought of as an independent cause.\n\n[232:4](sbe15100.htm#fr_707) Devatma _s_ akti is a very important term,\ndifferently explained by the commentators, but meaning a power belonging to\nthe Deva, the \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, the Lord, not independent of him, as the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khyas\nrepresent Prak _ri_ ti or nature. Herein lies the important distinction\nbetween Vedanta and _S_ a _n_ khya.\n\n[232:5](sbe15100.htm#fr_708) Kalatmabhya _m_ yuktani, kalapurushasa _m_\nyuktani svabhavadini. \xc3\x82tman is here taken as synonymous with purusha in verse\n2.\n\n[232:6](sbe15100.htm#fr_709) It is difficult to say whether this verse was\nwritten as a summing up of certain technicalities recognised in systems of\nphilosophy existing at the time, or whether it is a mere play of fancy. I\nprefer the former view, and subjoin the explanation given by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara,\nthough it is quite possible that on certain points he may be mistaken. The \xc3\x8e\n_s_ vara or deva is represented as a wheel with one felly, which would seem to\nbe the phenomenal world. It is called triv _ri_ t, threefold, or rather having\nthree tires, three bands or hoops to bind the felly, these tires being\nintended for the three gu _n_ as of the prak _ri_ ti, the Sattva, Ra _g_ as,\nand Tamas. In the Brahmopanishad (Bibl. Ind. p. 233 p. 251) the triv _ri_ t\nsutram is mentioned. Next follows sho _d_ a _s_ antam, ending in the sixteen.\nThese sixteen are differently explained. They may be meant for the five\nelements and the eleven indriyas or organs (the five receptive and the five\nactive senses, together with manas, the common sensory); or for the sixteen\nkalas, mentioned in the Pra _s_ _\xc3\xb1_ opanishad, VI, 1, p. 283. Then follows a\nnew interpretation. The one felly may be meant for the chaos, the undeveloped\nstate of things, and the sixteen would then be the two products in a general\nform, the Vira _g_ and the Sutratman, while the remaining fourteen would be\nthe individual products, the bhuvanas or worlds beginning with Bhu _h_.\n\nNext follows _s_ atardharam, having fifty spokes. These fifty spokes are\nsupposed to produce the motion of the mundane wheel, and are explained by _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara as follows:\n\n1\\. The five Viparyayas, misconceptions, different kinds of ignorance or\ndoubt, viz. Tamas, Moha, Mahamoha, Tamisra, Andhatamisra, or, according to\nPata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali, ignorance, self-love, love, hatred, and fear (Yoga-sutras I,\n8; II, 2; Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya-sutras III, 37).\n\n2\\. The twenty-eight A _s_ aktis, disabilities, causes of misconception. (See\nSa\xe1\xb9\x85khya-sutras III, 38.)\n\n3\\. The nine inversions of the Tush _t_ is, satisfactions. (Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya-sutras\nIII, 39.)\n\n4\\. The eight inversions of the Siddhis, perfections. (Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya-sutras III,\n40.)\n\nThese are afterwards explained singly. There are 8 kinds of Tamas, 8 kinds of\nMoha, 10 kinds of Mahamoha, 18 kinds of Tamisra, and 18 kinds of Andhatamisra,\nmaking 62 in all. More information on the A _s_ aktis, the Tush _t_ is, and\nSiddhis may be found in the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya-sutras III, 37-45; Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya-karika 47 seq.;\nYoga-sutras II, 2 seq.\n\nThen follow the 20 pratyaras, the counter-spokes, or wedges to strengthen the\nspokes, viz. the 10 senses and their 10 objects.\n\nThe six ash _t_ akas or ogdoads are explained as the ogdoads of Prak _ri_ ti,\nof substances (dhatu), of powers (ai _s_ varya), of states (bhava), of gods\n(deva), of virtues (atmagu _n_ a).\n\nThe one, though manifold cord, is love or desire, Kama, whether of food,\nchildren, heaven or anything else.\n\nThe three paths are explained as righteousness, unrighteousness, p. 234 and\nknowledge, and the one deception arising from two causes is ignorance of self,\nproduced by good or bad works.\n\n[234:1](sbe15100.htm#fr_710) Here again, where the \xc3\x8e _s_ vara is likened to a\nstream, the minute coincidences are explained by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara in accordance with\ncertain systems of philosophy. The five streams are the five receptive organs,\nthe five springs are the five elements, the five waves are the five active\norgans. The head is the manas, the mind, or common sensory, from which the\nperceptions of the five senses spring. The five whirlpools are the objects of\nthe five senses, the five rapids are the five pains of being in the womb,\nbeing born, growing old, growing ill, and dying. The next adjective pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\na _s_ adbhedam is not fully explained by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara. He only mentions the five\ndivisions of the kle _s_ a (see Yoga-sutras II, 2), but does not show how\ntheir number is raised to fifty. Dr. Roer proposes to read pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ akle _s_\na-bhedam, but that would not agree with the metre. The five parvans or\nbranches are not explained, and may refer to the fifty kinds of suffering (kle\n_s_ a). The whole river, like the wheel in the preceding verse, is meant for\nthe Brahman as karyakara _n_ atmaka, in the form of cause and effect, as the\nphenomenal, not the absolutely real world.\n\n[234:2](sbe15100.htm#fr_711) If he has been blessed by the \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, i.e.\nwhen he has been accepted by the Lord, when he has discovered his own true\nself in the Lord. It must be remembered, however, that both the \xc3\x8e _s_ vara,\nthe Lord, and the purusha, the individual soul, are phenomenal only, and that\nthe Brahma-wheel is meant for the prapa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a, the manifest, but unreal\nworld.\n\n[235:1](sbe15100.htm#fr_712) The subject (bhokt _ri_ ), the object (bhogya),\nand the mover (prerit _ri_ ), see verse 12.\n\n[235:2](sbe15100.htm#fr_713) B. has Vedavido, those who know the Vedas.\n\n[235:3](sbe15100.htm#fr_714) Tasmin praliyate tv atma samadhi _h_ sa udah _ri_\nta _h_.\n\n[235:4](sbe15100.htm#fr_715) Read badhyate for budhyate.\n\n[235:5](sbe15100.htm#fr_716) The form i _s_ ani _s_ au is explained as _kh_\nandasa; likewise brahmam for brahma.\n\n[235:6](sbe15100.htm#fr_717) Cf. _S_ vet. Up. IV, 5, bhuktabhogyam.\n\n[235:7](sbe15100.htm#fr_718) The three are (1) the lord, the personal god, the\ncreator and ruler; (2) the individual soul or souls; and (3) the power of\ncreation, the devatma _s_ akti of verse 3. All three are contained in Brahman;\nsee verses 7, 12. So 'pi mayi parame _s_ varo mayopadhisannidhes tadvan iva.\n\n[235:8](sbe15100.htm#fr_719) See verse 8.\n\n[235:9](sbe15100.htm#fr_720) The recognised name for Prak _ri_ ti, or here\nDevatma _s_ akti, in the later Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya philosophy.\n\n[235:10](sbe15100.htm#fr_721) Hara, one of the names of _S_ iva or Rudra, is\nhere explained as p. 236 avidyader hara _n_ at, taking away ignorance. He\nwould seem to be meant for the \xc3\x8e _s_ vara or deva, the one god, though\nimmediately afterwards he is taken for the true Brahman, and not for its\nphenomenal divine personification only.\n\n[236:1](sbe15100.htm#fr_722) The self, \xc3\x82tman, used here, as before, for\npurusha, the individual soul, or rather the individual souls.\n\n[236:2](sbe15100.htm#fr_723) A blissful state in the Brahma-world, which,\nhowever, is not yet perfect freedom, but may lead on to it. Thus it is said in\nthe _S_ ivadharmottara:\n\nDhyanad ai _s_ varyam, atulam ai _s_ varyat sukham uttamam,  \n_G_ _\xc3\xb1_ anena tat paritya _g_ ya videho muktim apnuyat.\n\n[236:3](sbe15100.htm#fr_724) This alone-ness, kevalatvam, is produced by the\nknowledge that the individual self is one with the divine self, and that both\nthe individual and the divine self are only phenomenal forms of the true Self,\nthe Brahman.\n\n[236:4](sbe15100.htm#fr_725) Bhokta, possibly for bhoktra, unless it is a _Kh_\nandasa form. It was quoted before, Bibl. Ind. p. 292, l. 5. The enjoyer is the\npurusha, the individual soul, the subject; the enjoyed is prak _ri_ ti,\nnature, the object; and the ruler is the \xc3\x8e _s_ vara, that is, Brahman, as god.\nI take brahmam etat in the same sense here as in verse 9.\n\n[236:5](sbe15100.htm#fr_726) This metaphor, like most philosophical metaphors\nin Sanskrit, p. 237 is rather obscure at first sight, but very exact when once\nunderstood. Fire, as produced by a fire drill, is compared to the Self. It is\nnot seen at first, yet it must be there all the time; its li\xe1\xb9\x85ga or subtle body\ncannot have been destroyed, because as soon as the stick, the indhana, is\ndrilled in the under-wood, the yoni, the fire becomes visible. In the same way\nthe Self, though invisible during a state of ignorance, is there all the time,\nand is perceived when the body has been drilled by the Pra _n_ ava, that is,\nafter, by a constant repetition of the sacred syllable Om, the body has been\nsubdued, and the ecstatic vision of the Self has been achieved.\n\nIndhana, the stick used for drilling, and yoni, the under-wood, in which the\nstick is drilled, are the two ara _n_ is, the fire-sticks used for kindling\nfire. See Tylor, Anthropology, p. 260.\n\n[237:1](sbe15100.htm#fr_727) Cf. Dhyanavindupan. verse 20; Brahmopanishad, p.\n256.\n\n[237:2](sbe15100.htm#fr_728) Srotas, a stream, seems to mean here the dry bed\nof a stream, which, if dug into, will yield water.\n\n[237:3](sbe15100.htm#fr_729) The construction is correct, if we remember that\nhe who is seized is the same as he who looks for the hidden Self. But the\nmetre would be much improved if we accepted the reading of the Brahmopanishad,\nevam atma atmani g _ri_ hyate 'sau, which is confirmed by B. The last line\nwould be improved by reading, satyenaina _m_ ye 'nupa _s_ yanti dhira _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Adhyaya II](sbe15101.htm)\n\n"
