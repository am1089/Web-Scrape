Bright, flaming, like the lover of the Dawn [1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:1:1),\nhe has, like the light of the sky, filled the two (worlds of Heaven and Earth)\nwhich are turned towards each other.\n\n2\\. As soon as thou wert born thou hast excelled by thy power of mind; being\nthe son of the gods thou hast become their father.\n\n3\\. (Agni is) a worshipper (of the gods), never foolish, (always)\ndiscriminating; (he is) like the udder of the cows; (he is) the sweetness of\nfood [1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:3:1)--\n\n4\\. Like a kind friend to men, not to be led astray\n[1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:4:1), sitting in the midst, the lovely one, in the\nhouse;\n\n5\\. Like a child when born, he is delightful in the house; like a race-horse\nwhich is well cared for [1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:5:1), he has wandered across\nthe clans [2](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:5:2).\n\n6\\. When I call (to the sacrifice) the clans who dwell in the same nest with\nthe heroes, may Agni then attain all divine powers\n[1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:6:1).\n\n7\\. When thou hast listened to these heroes, no one breaks those laws of\nthine.\n\n8\\. That verily is thy wonderful deed that thou hast killed\n[1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:8:1), with thy companions, (all foes), that, joined\nby the heroes, thou hast accomplished thy works [2](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:8:2).\n\n9\\. Like the lover of the Dawn [1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:9:1) resplendent and\nbright, of familiar form: may he (thus) pay attention to this (sacrificer).\n\np. 68\n\n10\\. Carrying (him) they opened by themselves the doors (of heaven). They all\nshouted at the aspect of the sun [1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:10:1).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The lover of the Dawn is here the Sun. See Pischel, Vedische Studien,\nI, 31.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Agni is the sweetness of food (comp. V, 7, 6. sva\xc2\xb4danam pituna\xc2\xb4m); it\nis not probable that sva\xc2\xb4dma and u\xc2\xb4dha _h_ should depend on vi _g_ anan, as\nLudwig believes.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. I adopt Boehtlingk-Roth's conjecture ahurya _h_. \xc3\x82hu\xc2\xb4rya _h_ would\nmean, 'he who is to be led astray.'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. See above, 66, 4.\n\nNote 2. 'He has overcome the (hostile) clans.' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Perhaps devatva\xc2\xb4 is an instrumental, as Ludwig takes it. In this case\nwe should have to translate: 'may Agni by his divine power attain everything.'\n--Prof. Max Muller translates this verse: 'When I with my men call the clans\nof the same nest (the gods), Agni will obtain all divine honours.'\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The first hemistich of this verse has eleven syllables instead of ten\nand shows the regular Trish _t_ ubh type. The same irregularity occurs in 70,\n4. 10. As I have shown in my Prolegomena, p. 97, this metrical irregularity\ndoes not necessitate corrections of the text,\n\np. 69\n\nand the comparison of X, 147, 1 (see next note), where it is said ahan yat v\n_ri_ tram \xe2\x80\xa6 vive _h_ apa _h_ , seems even to confirm the traditional reading.\nIt cannot he denied, however, that the double yat and the use of ahan without\nan object raises some suspicion. In I, 34, 3; 186, 4 we have samane ahan.\nPossibly we may read, tat tu te da _m_ sa _h_ ahan samane, 'this wonderful\ndeed of thine has been accomplished on one and the same day (with that\nmentioned in verse 7).' I am fully aware of the uncertainty of such guesses.\nThe removal of yat has already been proposed by Bollensen (Zeitschrift der\nDeutschen Morg. Gesellschaft, XXII, 592).\n\nNote 2. Here we may correct the text with greater certainty than in the first\nhemistich, or to speak more accurately, we shall have to correct not the\ntraditional text itself, but that ancient grammatical commentary on the text\nwhich has been preserved to us in the Padapa _th_ a. The words viverapa _m_ si\nof the Sa _m_ hitapa _th_ a are written in the Padapa _th_ a vive _h_ rapa _m_\nsi. Now we read IV, 19, 10. apa _m_ si \xe2\x80\xa6 narya aviveshi _h_ , 'thou hast\nperformed manly works.' In X, 147, 1 we have ahan yat v _ri_ tram naryam vive\n_h_ apa _h_ : here the adjective narya clearly shows that apa _h_ is a blunder\nfor apa _h_ , and we must translate, 'when thou hast killed V _ri_ tra and\nperformed thy manly work.' This passage shows that in X, 76, 3 also vive _h_\napa _h_ should be corrected (v. apa _h_ ). Thus we have three passages in\nwhich aviveshi _h_ or vive _h_ has the object apa _h_ , apa _m_ si, and we may\ninfer with full certainty that in our passage viverapa _m_ si does not\ncorrespond to a Padapa _th_ a reading vive _h_ rapa _m_ si but vive _h_ apa\n_m_ si. The same may be said with regard to VI, 31, 3 (mushaya _h_ _k_ akram\navive _h_ rapa _m_ si; Sa _m_ h. avive rapa _m_ si).\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Comp. above, verse 1.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Comp. above, 66, 10.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 70](sbe46020.htm)\n\n"
