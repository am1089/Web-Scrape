In the sacred\nbooks she appears in many forms, and is known by many names; but as there are\nlegends giving the circumstances connected with the names and forms more\ngenerally known, these will be given as far as possible in chronological\norder.\n\nWhen Devi (the goddess) appears as Um\xc4\x81, she is said to be the daughter of\nDaksha, a son of Brahm\xc4\x81. Her father was at first very unwilling that his\ndaughter should marry a mendicant, but his scruples were overcome by the\npersuasion of Brahm\xc4\x81. As Siva is styled Mah\xc4\x81deva, Um\xc4\x81 is frequently called\nsimply Devi. At this period of her existence she is also called Sati, in\nallusion to the fact that when her father slighted her husband by not inviting\nhim to the great sacrifice he made, she voluntarily entered the sacrificial\nfire and was burned to death in the presence of the gods and Br\xc4\x81hmans; or,\naccording to another account, was, under the same circumstances, consumed by\nher own glory. The name Sati means "the true, or virtuous woman," and is given\nto those widows who ascend the funeral pile of their husbands, and undergo a\nvoluntary death by being burned with his corpse. Ambik\xc4\x81, another name of Um\xc4\x81,\nin one of the earliest books, is said to be the sister of\n\np. 286\n\n[paragraph continues] Rudra; and yet in the later ones she is declared to be\nhis wife.\n\n"The earliest work, so far as I am aware, in which the name of Um\xc4\x81 appears, is\nthe Talavak\xc4\x81ra, or Kena Upanishad. In the third section of that treatise it is\nmentioned that on one occasion Brahm\xc4\x81 gained a victory for the gods. As,\nhowever, they were disposed to ascribe the credit of their success to\nthemselves, Brahm\xc4\x81 appeared for the purpose of disabusing them of their\nmistake. The gods did not know him, and commissioned first Agni and then V\xc4\x81yu,\nto ascertain what this apparition was. When, in answer to Brahm\xc4\x81\'s inquiry,\nthese two gods represented themselves, the one as having power to burn, and\nthe other to blow away anything whatever, he desired them respectively to burn\nand blow away a blade of grass; but they were unable to do this, and returned\nwithout ascertaining who he was. Indra was then commissioned to ascertain who\nthis apparition was. \'So be it,\' he replied, and approached that being, who\nvanished from him. In the sky he came to a woman, who was very resplendent,\nUm\xc4\x81 Haimavati. To her he said: \'What is this apparition?\' She said, It is\nBrahm\xc4\x81; in this victory of Brahm\xc4\x81 exult.\' By this he knew that it was Brahm\xc4\x81.\nThe commentators on this passage declare that Um\xc4\x81 means \'knowledge,\' and speak\nof Um\xc4\x81 as the impersonation of \'divine knowledge.\'" *\n\nProfessor Weber \xe2\x80\xa0 says: "As in Siva, first of all two gods, Agni and Rudra are\ncombined, so too his wife is to be regarded as a compound of several divine\nforms; and this becomes quite evident as we look over the mass of her\nepithets. While one set of these as Um\xc4\x81, Ambik\xc4\x81, P\xc4\x81rvati, Haimavati, belong to\nthe wife of Rudra, others\n\np. 287\n\nas K\xc4\x81li carry us back to the wife of Agni; while Gauri and others perhaps\nrefer to Nirriti the goddess of all evil." And he adds: "The most remarkable\ninstance of this is to be found in the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata in the hymn of Yudhishthira\nto Durg\xc4\x81, where he calls her Yasod\xc4\x81 Krishna, \'born in the cowherd family of\nNanda,\' \'sister of Vasudeva,\' \'enemy of Kansa,\' and as \'having the same\nfeatures as Sankarshana.\' Some such explanation is certainly necessary when we\nsee that K\xc4\x81li is said to be the same with Um\xc4\x81, the embodiment of \'heavenly\nwisdom.\'"\n\nIn the following passage from the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana, * Um\xc4\x81 is said to be the daughter\nof Himavat and Mena; the two forms of lima and P\xc4\x81rvati being confounded in the\nwriter\'s mind. "To Himavat, the chief of mountains, the great mine of metal,\ntwo daughters were born in beauty unequalled upon earth. The daughter of Meru,\nMend by name, the pleasing and beloved wife of Himavat, was their slender-\nwaisted mother. Of her was born Gang\xc4\x81, the eldest daughter of Himavat, and his\nsecond daughter was Um\xc4\x81, who, rich in austere observances, having undertaken\nan arduous rite, fulfilled a course of severe austerity. This daughter lima,\ndistinguished by severe austerity, adored by the worlds, the chief of the\nmountains gave to the matchless Rudra. These were the two daughters of the\nKing of the Mountains: Gang\xc4\x81, the most eminent of rivers, and Um\xc4\x81 the most\nexcellent of goddesses."\n\n"The Harivansa \xe2\x80\xa0 mentions three daughters of Himavat and Mena, but Gang\xc4\x81 is\nnot amongst them. "Their (the Pitris) mental daughter was Mena, the eminent\nwife of the great mountain Himavat. The King of the Mountains begat three\ndaughters upon\n\np. 288\n\n[paragraph continues] Men\xc4\x81, viz. Aparn\xc4\x81, Ekaparn\xc4\x81, and Ekap\xc4\x81tal\xc4\x81. These three\nperforming very great austerity, such as could not be performed by gods or\nD\xc4\x81navas, distressed [with alarm] both the stationary and the moving worlds.\nEkaparn\xc4\x81 (one leaf) fed upon one leaf. Ekap\xc4\x81tal\xc4\x81 took only one p\xc4\x81tala\n(Bignonia) for her food. One (Aparn\xc4\x81) took no sustenance; but her mother,\ndistressed through maternal affection, forbade her, dissuading her with her\nwords _u m \xc4\x81_ (Oh, don\'t). The beautiful goddess, performing arduous\nausterity, having been thus addressed by her mother, became known in the three\nworlds as Um\xc4\x81. In this manner the contemplative goddess became renowned under\nthat name. All these three had mortified bodies, were distinguished by the\nforce of contemplation, and were all chaste, and expounders of divine\nknowledge. Um\xc4\x81 was the eldest and most excellent of the three. Distinguished\nby the force derived from deep contemplation, she obtained Mah\xc4\x81deva [for her\nhusband]."\n\nSeveral of the names under which Um\xc4\x81 is now known and worshipped are to be\nfound in the older writings of the Hindus, though at that time they did not\nrefer to Siva\'s wife. Um\xc4\x81, as we have already seen, was "Wisdom;" Ambik\xc4\x81 was a\nsister of Rudra; Durg\xc4\x81 "in a hymn of the Taittiriya \xc4\x80ranyaka is an epithet of\nthe sacrificial flame; and K\xc4\x81li, a word which occurs in the Mandaka Upanishad,\nis the name of one of the seven flickering tongues of Agni, the god of fire."\n*\n\nUm\xc4\x81 is called the mother of Kartikeya, and in a certain sense of Ganesa too;\nbut it is not at all clear whether it was really as Um\xc4\x81 or in her succeeding\nbirth as P\xc4\x81rvati that she had these children.\n\np. 289\n\nThe "Kurm\xc4\x81 Pur\xc4\x81na" * has an account of Um\xc4\x81\'s creation which takes us back, a\nstage anterior to her birth as a daughter of Daksha. "When Brahm\xc4\x81 was angry\nwith his sons for adopting an ascetic life [and refusing to perpetuate the\nhuman race], a form half male and half female was produced from that anger, to\nwhom Brahm\xc4\x81 said, \'Divide thyself,\' and then disappeared. The male half became\nRudra, and the female, at the command of Brahm\xc4\x81, became the daughter of Daksha\nunder the name of Sati, and was given in marriage to Rudra, and when she\nsubsequently gave up her life on being treated with disrespect by her father,\nshe was born a second time as the daughter of Himavat and Mena, and named\nP\xc4\x81rvati."\n\nIt should be noticed that although Um\xc4\x81 is called the _wife_ of Siva, it is\nunderstood that she represents the energy or active power of that deity; she\nassumed a body in order that she might be united to him in due form; in like\nmanner Vishnu\'s energy became incarnate in Lakshmi, Sita, etc.\n\n##### P\xc4\x80RVATI.\n\nThe goddess in this form is the constant companion of her husband, but few\nindependent actions are ascribed to her. In the Pur\xc4\x81nas, Siva and P\xc4\x81rvati are\ngenerally represented as engaged in making love to each other, or (rather a\nsingular change) as seated on Mount Kail\xc4\x81sa discussing the most abstruse\nquestions of Hindu philosophy. Occasionally, however, quarrels arose between\nthem, and on one occasion Siva reproached her for the blackness of her skin.\nThis taunt so grieved her that she left him for a time, and, repairing to a\ndeep forest,\n\np. 290\n\nperformed a most severe course of austerities, until Brahm\xc4\x81 granted her as a\nboon that her complexion should be golden, and from this circumstance she is\nknown as Gauri. *\n\n[![SIVA AND P\xc4\x80RVATI.](tn/29000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/29000.jpg)  \nSIVA AND P\xc4\x80RVATI.  \n\nThe following legend from the "V\xc4\x81raha Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0 describes her origin. Brahm\xc4\x81\nwhen on a visit to Siva\n\np. 291\n\non Mount Kail\xc4\x81sa is thus addressed by him: "Say quickly, O Brahm\xc4\x81, what has\ninduced you to come to me?" Brahm\xc4\x81 replies, "There is a mighty asura named\nAndhak\xc4\x81 (Darkness), by whom all the gods, having been distressed, came for\nprotection, and I have hastened to inform you of their complaints." Brahm\xc4\x81\nthen looked intently at Siva, who by thought summoned Vishnu into their\npresence. As the three deities looked at each other, "from their three\nrefulgent glances sprang into being a virgin of celestial loveliness, of hue\ncerulean, like the petals of a blue lotus, and adorned with gems, who\nbashfully bowed before Brahm\xc4\x81, Vishnu, and Siva. On their asking her who she\nwas, and why she was distinguished by the three colours black, white, and red,\nshe said, "From your glances was I produced; do you not know your own\nomnipotent energies? " Brahm\xc4\x81 then praising her, said, "Thou shalt be named\nthe goddess of three times (past, present and future), the preserver of the\nuniverse, and under various appellations shalt thou be worshipped, as thou\nshalt be the cause of accomplishing the desires of thy votaries. But, O\ngoddess, divide thyself into three forms, according to the colours by which\nthou art distinguished." She then, as Brahm\xc4\x81 had requested, divided herself\ninto three parts; one white, one red, and one black. The white was "\nSarasvati, of a lovely, felicitous form, and the cooperator with Brahm\xc4\x81 in\ncreation; the red was Lakshmi, the beloved of Vishnu, who with him preserves\nthe universe; the black was P\xc4\x81rvati, endowed with many qualities and the\nenergy of Siva." In the preceding legend it was narrated how P\xc4\x81rvati,\noriginally black, became golden-coloured.\n\nThe "Vaivarta Pur\xc4\x81na" * relates the circumstance\n\np. 292\n\nwhich led to the re-appearance on earth of Um\xc4\x81, who had sacrificed herself and\nbecame a Sati, under the form of P\xc4\x81rvati. Siva, hearing of the death of his\nwife, fainted from grief; on his recovery he hastened to the banks of the\nriver of heaven, where he beheld "the body of his beloved Sati arrayed in\nwhite garments, holding a rosary in her hand, and glowing with splendour\nbright as burnished gold. No sooner did he see the lifeless form of his\nspouse, than, through grief for her loss, his senses forsook him." When he\nrevived, gazing on her beautiful countenance, with tears in his eyes and\nsorrow in his voice, he thus addressed her: "Arise, arise, O my beloved Sati!\nI am Sankara, thy lord; look therefore on me, who have approached thee. With\nthee I am almighty, the framer of all things, and the giver of every bliss;\nbut without thee, my energy! I am like a corpse, powerless and incapable of\naction: how then, my beloved, canst thou forsake me? With smiles and glances\nof thine eyes, say something sweet as amrita, and with the rain of thy gentle\nwords sprinkle my heart, which is scorched with grief. Formerly, when thou\ndidst see me from a distance, thou wouldst greet me with the fondest accents;\nwhy then to-day art thou angry, and wilt not speak to me, thus sadly\nlamenting? O lord of my soul, arise! O mother of the universe, arise! Dost\nthou not see me here weeping? O beauteous one! thou .canst not have expired.\nThen, O my faithful spouse! why dost thou not honour me as usual? And why dost\nthou thus, disobedient to my voice, infringe thy marriage vow?"\n\n"Siva, having thus spoken, raised the lifeless body, and in the anguish of\nseparation pressed it to his bosom, and kissed it again and again. Lip to lip,\nand breast to breast, Sankara clasped the corpse of his beloved; and,\n\np. 293\n\nafter frequent Paintings, arose, and, pressing Sati closely to his bosom,\nrushed forward maddened with grief. Like a man deprived of his senses, the\npreceptor of the universe wandered over the seven _dwipas_ , until, exhausted\nby fatigue and anguish, he fell down in a swoon at the foot of a banyan tree.\nThe gods, seeing Siva in this state, were greatly astonished, and, accompanied\nby Brahm\xc4\x81 and Vishnu, hastened to the spot where he lay. Vishnu placed the\nhead of the fainting Siva on his bosom and wept aloud; after a little time he\nencouraged his friend by saying, \'O Siva! recover thy senses, and listen to\nwhat I say. Thou wilt certainly regain Sati, since Siva and Sati are as\ninseparable as cold from water, heat from fire, smell from earth, or radiance\nfrom the sun!"\n\n"Hearing these words, Siva faintly opened his eyes, bedewed with tears, and\nsaid: \'O form of splendour! who art thou? Who are these that accompany thee?\nWho am I, and where are my attendants? Where art thou and these going? Where\nam I, and where proceeding?\' As Vishnu heard these words he wept, and his\ntears, uniting with those of Siva, formed a lake, which hence became a famous\nplace of pilgrimage. Vishnu at length calmed Siva, who, delighted with his\nwords, beheld Sati, seated before him in a gem-adorned car, accompanied by\nnumerous attendants, arrayed in costly garments; resplendent with ornaments,\nher placid face being irradiated with a gentle smile. The anguish of\nseparation ceased, and joy filled his soul as Sati thus addressed him: \'Be\nfirm, O Mah\xc4\x81deva! lord of my soul! In whatever state of my being I may exist,\nI shall never be separated from my lord; and now have I been born the daughter\nof Himavat in order to become again thy wife; therefore no longer grieve on\naccount of\n\np. 294\n\nour separation.\' Having thus consoled Siva, Sati disappeared."\n\nIn another chapter of the same Pur\xc4\x81na we have an account of their reunion. * "\nSati soon obtained another birth in the womb of Himavat\'s wife; and Siva,\ncollecting the bones and ashes from her funeral pile, made a necklace of the\nbones and covered his body with the ashes, and thus preserved them as\nmemorials of his\n\n[![P\xc4\x80RVATI WORSHIPPING THE LINGA.](tn/29400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/29400.jpg)  \nP\xc4\x80RVATI WORSHIPPING THE LINGA.  \n\nbeloved. Not long after this, Sati was born as the daughter of Men\xc4\x81, excelling\nin beauty and virtue all created beings, and she grew up in her mountain home\nlike the young moon increasing to its full splendour. Whilst still a girl, she\nheard a voice from heaven saying, \'Perform a severe course of austerity, in\norder to obtain Siva for a husband, as he cannot otherwise be obtained.\'\nP\xc4\x81rvati, proud of her youth, smiling disdainfully at this\n\np. 295\n\ninstruction, thought within herself, \'Will he who, on account of the grief he\nfelt for my having formerly consumed myself, not accept me as his spouse when\nredolent of life? And how can disjunction exist between those who have been\npredestined from their first being to be husband and wife?\' Confident in her\nyouth, loveliness, and numerous attractions, and persuaded that on the first\nmention of her name Siva would be anxious to espouse her, P\xc4\x81rvati did not seek\nto gain him by the performance of austerity, but night and day gave herself to\njoyous sports with her companions." Her hopes, however, were disappointed. She\nhad to perform most severe penance before she was reunited to her husband; and\nit was only by the assistance of K\xc4\x81madeva, who, at the instigation of the\ngods, wounded him with his arrows as he was engaged in meditation, whilst\nP\xc4\x81rvati was seated in front of him, that her wish was gratified. Siva at first\nwas anything but grateful for this interference; and as before narrated he\nrewarded K\xc4\x81ma by destroying him with a flame of glory that issued from his\nthird eye.\n\nIn a Bengali account of Durg\xc4\x81, a legend is given from a later work than the\nPur\xc4\x81na from which the above extract was taken. It is to the following\neffect:--When Siva raised the dead body of Sati in his arms he began to dance\nin a frantic manner. The earth trembled beneath the weight of such a load; and\nVishnu, fearing there would be an utter destruction of the universe if this\nwere allowed to continue, let fly his wonder-working discus, and cut the body\ninto fifty-one pieces. These fell in different places, a leg here, a hand\nthere; but wherever a part touched the earth, the spot became sacred, an image\nof the goddess was set up, and a temple rose--in some places it is said they\ngrew to her honour\n\np. 296\n\n[paragraph continues] --which pilgrims still visit as shrines. The renowned\ntemple at K\xc4\x81li Ghat, near Calcutta, is said to possess the big toe of her left\nfoot; and the other principal shrines of P\xc4\x81rvati profess to contain a relic of\nher body.\n\nP\xc4\x81rvati is represented in pictures as a fair and beautiful woman, with no\nsuperfluity of limbs. Few miraculous deeds are claimed for her. It is when she\nappears as Durg\xc4\x81, K\xc4\x81li, etc., that she manifests divine powers, and exhibits a\nvery different spirit from that which appears in her as P\xc4\x81rvati. Hence the\nsupposition that these were originally distinct deities, though now believed\nto be one and the same.\n\n##### DURG\xc4\x80.\n\nThe consort of Siva now assumes a very different character from that in which\nshe has so far been represented. In those incarnations, though the wife of\nSiva, she acted as an ordinary woman, and manifested womanly virtues; as Durg\xc4\x81\nshe was a most powerful warrior, and appeared on earth, under many names, for\nthe destruction of demons who were obnoxious to gods and men.\n\nShe obtained the name Durg\xc4\x81 because she slew an asura named Durg\xc4\x81, the name of\nthe goddess being the feminine form of the demon\'s name. The " Skanda Pur\xc4\x81na"\n* gives the following account of this occurrence. Kartikeya, being asked by\nAgastya, the sage, why his mother was called Durg\xc4\x81, says: "A giant named\nDurg\xc4\x81, the son of Ruru, having performed penance in favour of Brahm\xc4\x81, obtained\nhis blessing, and grew so mighty that he conquered the three worlds, and\ndethroned Indra and the other gods. He compelled the wives of the Rishis\n\np. 297\n\nto sing his praise, and sent the gods from heaven to dwell in the forests, and\nby a mere nod summoned them to reverence him. He abolished religious\nceremonies; Br\xc4\x81hmans through fear of him gave up the reading of the Vedas;\nrivers changed their course; fire lost its energy, and the terrified stars\nretired from sight. He assumed the shape of the clouds, and gave rain whenever\nhe pleased; the earth, through fear, yielded an abundant harvest, and the\ntrees flowered and gave fruit out of the proper season."\n\nThe gods in their distress appealed to Siva. Indra, their king, said, "He has\ndethroned me!" Surya said, "He has taken my kingdom!" Siva, pitying them,\ndesired P\xc4\x81rvati to go and destroy this giant. She, accepting the commission\nwillingly, calmed the fears of the gods, and first sent K\xc4\x81lar\xc4\x81tri (Dark\nNight), a female whose beauty bewitched the inhabitants of the three worlds,\nto order the demon to restore things to their ancient order. He, however, full\nof fury, sent his soldiers to lay hold of K\xc4\x81lar\xc4\x81tri; but by the breath of her\nmouth she reduced them to ashes. Durg\xc4\x81 then sent 30,000 other giants, who were\nsuch monsters in size that they covered the surface of the earth. At the sight\nof these giants, K\xc4\x81lar\xc4\x81tri fled to P\xc4\x81rvati, followed by the giants. Durg\xc4\x81,\nwith 100,000,000 chariots, 120,000,000,000 elephants, 10,000,000 swift-footed\nhorses, and innumerable soldiers, went to fight P\xc4\x81rvati, on the Vindhya\nmountain. As soon as he drew near, P\xc4\x81rvati assumed 1000 arms, called to her\nassistance different beings, and produced a number of weapons from her body (a\nlong list of these is given in the Pur\xc4\x81na). The troops of the giant poured\ntheir arrows on P\xc4\x81rvati as she sat on the mountain Vindhya, thick as the drops\nof rain in a storm; they even tore up trees, mountains, etc., and hurled them\n\np. 298\n\nat her; in return she threw a weapon which carried away the arms of many of\nthe giants. Durg\xc4\x81 himself then hurled a flaming dart at the goddess, which she\nturned aside; another being sent, she stopped it by a hundred arrows. He next\naimed an arrow at P\xc4\x81rvati\'s breast; this too she repelled, and two other\nweapons, a club and a pike. At last coming to close quarters, P\xc4\x81rvati seized\nDurg\xc4\x81 and set her left foot on his breast, but he, managing to disengage\nhimself, renewed the fight.\n\nP\xc4\x81rvati then caused a number of helpers to issue from her body, which\ndestroyed the soldiers of the giants. In return, Durg\xc4\x81 sent a dreadful shower\nof hail, the effect of which P\xc4\x81rvati counteracted by an instrument called\nSosuna. The demon now assumed the shape of an elephant as large as a mountain,\nand approached the goddess; but she tied his legs, and, with her nails, which\nwere like scimitars, tore him to pieces. He rose again in the form of a\nbuffalo, and with his horns cast stones, trees, and mountains, tearing up the\ntrees by the breath of his nostrils. P\xc4\x81rvati then pierced him with her\ntrident; he reeled to and fro, and, renouncing the form of a buffalo, assumed\nhis original body as a giant, with a thousand arms, having a weapon in each.\nApproaching P\xc4\x81rvati, she seized him by his arms, and carried him into the air,\nwhence she threw him to the ground with fearful force. Seeing that the fall\nhad not destroyed him, she pierced him in the breast with an arrow, whereupon\nblood issued from his mouth in streams, and he died. The gods were delighted\nat the result, and soon regained their former splendour.\n\nStill another account of the origin of Durg\xc4\x81 is found in the Chandi, a part of\nthe "M\xc4\x81rkandeya Pur\xc4\x81na." * Mahisha, king of the giants, at one time overcame\nthe\n\np. 299\n\ngods in war, and reduced them to such a state of want that they wandered\nthrough the earth as beggars. Indra first conducted them to Brahm\xc4\x81, and then\nto Siva; but as these gods could render no assistance, they turned to Vishnu,\nwho was so grieved at the sight of their wretchedness, that streams of glory\nissued from his face, whence came a female figure named Mah\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81ya (another name\nof Durg\xc4\x81). Streams of glory issued from the faces of the other gods also,\nwhich in like manner entered Mah\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81ya; in consequence of which she became a\nbody of glory, like a mountain of fire. The gods then handed their weapons to\nthis dreadful being, who with a frightful scream ascended into the air, slew\nthe giant, and gave redress to the gods.\n\nThe account, as found in the "V\xc4\x81mana Pur\xc4\x81na," * differs in some details. When\nthe gods had sought Vishnu in their distress, he, and at his command Sankara\n(Siva), Brahm\xc4\x81, and the other gods, emitted such flames from their eyes and\ncountenances that a mountain of effulgence was formed, from which became\nmanifest Katyayini, refulgent as a thousand suns, having three eyes, black\nhair, and eighteen arms. Siva gave her his trident, Vishnu a discus, Varuna a\nconch-shell, Agni a dart, V\xc4\x81yu a bow, Surya a quiver full of arrows, Indra a\nthunderbolt, Kuvera a mace, Brahm\xc4\x81 a rosary and water-pot, Kala a shield and\nsword, Visvakarma a battle-axe and other weapons. Thus armed, and adored by\nthe gods, Katyayini proceeded to the Vindhya hills. Whilst there, the asuras\nChanda and Manda saw her, and being captivated by her beauty they so described\nher to Mahisha, their king, that he was anxious to obtain her. On asking for\nher hand, she told him she must be won in fight. He came, and fought; at\nlength Durg\xc4\x81\n\np. 300\n\ndismounted from her lion, and sprang upon the back of Mahisha, who was in the\nform of a buffalo, and with her tender feet so smote him on the head that he\nfell to the ground senseless, when she cut off his head with her sword.\n\nIn pictures and images Durg\xc4\x81 is represented as a golden-coloured woman, with a\ngentle and beautiful countenance. She has ten arms; in one hand she holds a\nspear, with which she is piercing the giant Mahisha; with one of her left\nhands she holds the tail of a serpent, with another the hair of the giant\nwhose breast the snake is biting; her other hands are filled with various\nweapons. Her lion leans against her right leg, and the giant against her left.\nThe images of Lakshmi, Sarasvati, Kartikeya, and Ganesa are frequently made\nand worshipped with that of Durg\xc4\x81. The frontispiece is a representation of\nDurg\xc4\x81 and the other goddesses and gods, as they are made in Bengal at the time\nof the great autumnal festival.\n\nIn Bengal the worship of this goddess forms the most popular of all the Hindu\nfestivals; it continues for three days, and is the great holiday of the year.\nAt this season, as at Christmas in England, the members of the family whom\nbusiness detains from home during the year return; and with the worship of\nDurg\xc4\x81 is associated all that is bright and cheerful. Sacrifices of buffaloes\nand goats are made to her; feasting, singing, and dancing are continued\nthrough the greater part of the night. Though her chief festival is in the\nautumn, she is also worshipped, though not so generally, in the spring. The\nreason of this as taught in a Bengali account is as follows:--R\xc4\x81vana was a\ndevout worshipper of Durg\xc4\x81, and had the Chandi (an extract from one of the\nPur\xc4\x81nas) read daily. When, therefore, R\xc4\x81ma attacked\n\np. 301\n\nhim, the goddess assisted her servant. It was in the spring that R\xc4\x81vana\nobserved her festival. R\xc4\x81ma, seeing the help his enemy received from this\ngoddess, began himself to worship her. This was in the autumn. Durg\xc4\x81 was\ndelighted with the devotion of R\xc4\x81ma, and at once transferred her aid to him.\n\nDurg\xc4\x81 is said to have assumed ten forms for the\n\n[![DASABHUJ\xc4\x80.](tn/30100.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/30100.jpg)  \nDASABHUJ\xc4\x80.  \n\ndestruction of two giants, Sumbha and Nisumbha; the "M\xc4\x81rkandeya Pur\xc4\x81na"\ndescribes these incarnations in the following order:--(1) As Durg\xc4\x81 she\nreceived the message of the giants; (2) As Dasabhuj\xc4\x81 (the ten-armed) she slew\npart of their army; (3) As Singhav\xc4\x81hini (seated on a lion) she fought with\nRaktavija; (4) As Mahish\xc4\x81mardini (destroyer of a buffalo) she slew Sumbha in\nthe\n\np. 302\n\nform of a buffalo; (5) As Jagaddh\xc4\x81tri (the mother of the world) she overcame\nthe army of the giants; (6) As K\xc4\x81li (the black woman) she slew Raktavija; (7)\nAs Muktakesi (with flowing hair) she overcame another of the armies of the\ngiants; (8) As T\xc4\x81ra (the saviour) she slew Sumbha in his own proper shape; (9)\nAs Chinnamustaka (the headless) she killed Nisumbha; (10) As Jagadgauri (the\ngolden-coloured lady renowned through the world) she received the praises and\nthanks of the gods. *\n\nThe great conflict for success in which Durg\xc4\x81 assumed so many forms is\ndescribed as follows in the "M\xc4\x81rkandeya Pur\xc4\x81na." \xe2\x80\xa0 At the close of the Treta\nAge, two giants, named Sumbha and Nisumbha, performed religious austerities\nfor 10,000 years, the merit of which brought Siva from heaven, who discovered\nthat by this extraordinary devotion, they sought to obtain the blessing of\nimmortality. He reasoned long with them, and vainly endeavoured to persuade\nthem to ask for any other gift. Being denied what they specially wanted, they\nentered upon still more severe austerities, for another thousand years, when\nSiva again appeared, but still refused to grant what they asked. They now\nsuspended themselves with their heads downwards over a slow fire, till the\nblood streamed from their necks: they continued thus for 800 years. The gods\nbegan to tremble, lest, by performing such rigid acts of holiness, these\ndemons should supplant them on their thrones. The king of the gods thereupon\ncalled a council, and imparted to them his fears. They admitted that there was\nground for anxiety, but asked what was the remedy.\n\n"Acting upon the advice of Indra, Kandarpa (the god of love), with Rambh\xc4\x81 and\nTilatam\xc4\x81, the most beautiful of the celestial nymphs, were sent to fill the\nminds of\n\np. 303\n\nthe giants with sensual desires. Kandarpa with his arrow wounded both; upon\nwhich, awaking from their absorption, and seeing two beautiful women, they\nwere taken in the snare, and abandoned their devotions. With these women they\nlived for 5000 years; after which they saw the folly of renouncing their hopes\nof immortality for the sake of sensual gratifications. They suspected this\nsnare must have been a contrivance of Indra; so, driving back the nymphs to\nheaven, they renewed their devotions, cutting the flesh off their bones, and\nmaking burnt offerings of it to Siva. They continued in this way for 1000\nyears, till at last they became mere skeletons; Siva again appeared and\nbestowed upon them his blessing--that in riches and strength they should excel\nthe gods.\n\n"Being exalted above the gods, they began to make war upon them. After various\nsuccesses on both sides, the giants became everywhere victorious; when Indra\nand the gods, reduced to a most deplorable state of wretchedness, solicited\nthe interference of Brahm\xc4\x81 and Vishnu. They referred them to Siva, who\ndeclared that he could do nothing for them. When, however, they reminded him\nthat it was through his blessing they had been ruined, he advised them to\nperform religious austerities to Durg\xc4\x81. They did so; and after some time the\ngoddess appeared, and gave them her blessing; then disguising herself as a\ncommon female carrying a pitcher of water, she passed through the assembly of\nthe gods. She then assumed her proper form, and said, \'They are celebrating my\npraise.\'\n\n"This new goddess now ascended Mount Him\xc4\x81laya, where Chanda and Manda, two of\nSumbha and Nisumbha\'s messengers, resided. As these demons wandered over the\nmountain, they saw the goddess;\n\np. 304\n\nand being exceedingly struck with her charms, which they described to their\nmasters, advised them to engage her affections, even if they gave her all the\nglorious things which they had obtained in plundering the heavens of the gods.\n\n"Sumbha sent Sugriva as messenger to the goddess, to inform her that the\nriches of the three worlds were in his palace; that all the offerings which\nused to be presented to the gods were now offered to him, and that all these\nofferings, riches, etc., would be hers, if she would come to him. The goddess\nreplied that the offer was very liberal, but that she had resolved that the\nperson she married must first conquer her in war, and destroy her pride.\nSugriva, unwilling to return unsuccessful, pressed for a favourable answer,\npromising that he would conquer her in war, and subdue her pride; and asked in\nan authoritative strain: \'Did she know his master, before whom none of the\ninhabitants of the worlds had been able to stand, whether gods, demons, or\nmen? How then could she, a female, think of resisting his offers? If his\nmaster had ordered him, he would have compelled her to go into his presence\nimmediately.\' She agreed that this was very correct, but that she had taken\nher resolution, and exhorted him, therefore, to persuade his master to come\nand try his strength with her.\n\n"The messenger went and related what he had heard. On hearing his account,\nSumbha was filled with rage, and, without making any reply, called for\nDhumlochana his commander-in-chief, and gave him orders to go to Him\xc4\x81laya and\nseize the goddess and bring her to him, and, if any attempted a rescue,\nutterly to destroy them.\n\n"The commander went to Him\xc4\x81laya, and acquainted the goddess with his master\'s\norders. She, smiling,\n\np. 305\n\ninvited him to execute them. On the approach of this hero, she set up a\ndreadful roar, by which he was reduced to ashes. After which she destroyed the\narmy of the giant, leaving only a few fugitives to communicate the tidings.\nSumbha and Nisumbha, infuriated, sent Chanda and Manda, who, on ascending the\nmountain, perceived a female sitting on an ass, laughing. On seeing them she\nbecame enraged, and drew to her ten, twenty, or thirty of their army at a\ntime, devouring them like fruit. She next seized Manda by the hair, cut off\nhis head, and holding it over her mouth, drank the blood. Chanda, on seeing\nthe other commander slain in this manner, himself came to close quarters with\nthe goddess. But she, mounted on a lion, sprang on him, and, despatching him\nas she had done Manda, devoured part of his army, and drank the blood of the\nslain.\n\n"The giants no sooner heard this alarming news than they resolved to go\nthemselves, and collecting their forces, an infinite number of giants, marched\nto Him\xc4\x81laya. The gods looked down with astonishment on this vast army, and the\ngoddesses descended to help Mah\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81ya (Durg\xc4\x81), who, however, soon destroyed her\nfoes. Raktavija, the principal commander under Sumbha, and Nisumbha, seeing\nall his men destroyed, encountered the goddess in person. But though she\ncovered him with wounds, from every drop of blood which fell to the ground a\nthousand giants arose equal in strength to Raktavija himself. Hence\ninnumerable enemies surrounded Durg\xc4\x81, and the gods were filled with alarm at\nthe amazing sight. At length Chandi, a goddess who had assisted K\xc4\x81li (Durg\xc4\x81)\nin the engagement, promised that if she would drink the giant\'s blood before\nit fell to the ground, she (Chandi) would engage him and destroy the whole of\nhis strangely-formed\n\np. 306\n\noffspring. K\xc4\x81li consented, and the commander and his army were soon\ndespatched.\n\n"Sumbha and Nisumbha, in a state of desperation, next engaged the goddess in\nsingle combat, Sumbha making the first onset. The battle was inconceivably\ndreadful on both sides, till at last both the giants were slain, and K\xc4\x81li sat\ndown to feed on the carnage she had made. The gods and goddesses chanted the\npraises of the celestial heroine, who in return bestowed a blessing on each."\n\nIt seems scarcely correct to speak of these forms of Durg\xc4\x81 as incarnations;\nthey are rather epithets descriptive of her appearance or method of fighting\nat different times during the great conflict. There is, however, so great a\ndifference in appearance and character between P\xc4\x81rvati and K\xc4\x81li that it is not\neasy to regard them as the same being; yet Durg\xc4\x81, whilst represented as a\nwarrior fully armed, has the calm features and golden colour of the goddess in\nher earlier manifestation. It appears a reasonable hypothesis that K\xc4\x81li was\noriginally altogether distinct from Um\xc4\x81 or P\xc4\x81rvati.\n\nIn the following hymn of Arjuna to Durg\xc4\x81 in the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata, * her many names\nare mentioned:--"Reverence be to thee, Siddha-Sen\xc4\x81ni (generaless of the\nSiddhas), the noble, the dweller on Mandara, Kum\xc4\x81ri (Princess), K\xc4\x81li, Kap\xc4\x81li,\nKapil\xc4\x81, Krishnapingal\xc4\x81. Reverence to thee, Bhadrak\xc4\x81li; reverence to thee, Mah\xc4\x81\nK\xc4\x81li, Chandi, Chand\xc4\x81, T\xc4\x81rini (deliveress), Varavarini (beautiful-coloured). O\nfortunate K\xc4\x81ly\xc4\x81yani, O Kar\xc4\x81li, O Vijay\xc4\x81, O Jay\xc4\x81 (victory), younger sister of\nthe chief of cowherds (Krishna), delighting always in Mahisha\'s blood! O Um\xc4\x81,\nSakambhari, thou white one, thou black one!\n\np. 307\n\n[paragraph continues] O destroyer of Kaitabha! Of sciences, thou art the\nscience of Brahma (or of the Vedas), the great sleep of embodied beings. O\nmother of Skanda (Kartikeya), divine Durg\xc4\x81, dweller in wildernesses! Thou,\ngreat goddess, art praised with a pure heart. By thy favour let me ever be\nvictorious in battle." In another verse of this same book she is said to dwell\nperpetually in the Vindhya hills, and "to delight in spirituous liquors,\nflesh, and sacrificial victims."\n\nThe statement that Durg\xc4\x81 was the younger sister of Krishna refers to the fact\nthat it was she who took Krishna\'s place in Devaki\'s womb after Vasudeva had\ncarried the infant Krishna to Nanda, and whom Kansa attempted to destroy by\ndashing her against a stone immediately after her birth. Krishna promised, if\nshe would take his place as Devaki\'s child, "becoming assimilated to him in\nglory, she would obtain an eternal place in the sky, be installed by Indra\namongst the gods, obtain a perpetual abode on the Vindhya mountains, where\nmeditating upon him (Vishnu) she would kill two demons, Sumbha and Nisumbha,\nand would be worshipped with animal sacrifices." *\n\n##### THE CHIEF FORMS OF DURG\xc4\x80.\n\n1\\. Durg\xc4\x81 received Chanda and Manda, the messengers of the giants; they,\nstruck with her beauty, spoke so rapturously of her to their lords that Sumbha\nsent her an offer of marriage by Sugriva.\n\n2\\. Dasabhuj\xc4\x81, \xe2\x80\xa0 the ten-handed, destroyed Sumbha\'s army under the commander-\nin-chief Dhumlochana. Of these troops only a few fugitives escaped to carry\nthe news of their defeat to their master.\n\np. 308\n\n3\\. Singhav\xc4\x81hini (riding on a lion) fought with Chanda and Manda, and has four\narms only. She drank the blood of the leaders, and devoured a large part of\ntheir troops.\n\n4\\. Mahisham\xc4\x81rdini (the slayer of Mahisha) slew Sumbha as he attacked her in\nthe form of a buffalo. She had eight or, according to other accounts, ten\narms.\n\n[![JAGADDH\xc4\x80TRI.](tn/30800.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/30800.jpg)  \nJAGADDH\xc4\x80TRI.  \n\n[paragraph continues] There is little to distinguish the account of this form\nfrom that of Durg\xc4\x81.\n\n5\\. Jagaddh\xc4\x81tri (the mother of the world) destroyed another army of the\ngiants; is dressed in red garments, and is seated on a lion. She, too, has\nfour arms only, and is very similar to Singhav\xc4\x81hini; the difference being in\nthe weapons she wields, As Singhav\xc4\x81hini, she\n\np. 309\n\ncarries a sword and spear, and with two hands is encouraging her worshippers;\nas Jagaddh\xc4\x81tri, she carries a conch-shell, discus, bow and arrow. In all the\nabove forms she is represented as a fair, beautiful, gentle-looking lady.\n\n6\\. K\xc4\x81li (the black woman), or, as she is more commonly called, K\xc4\x81li M\xc4\x81, the\nblack mother, with the aid of Chandi, slew Raktavija, the principal leader of\nthe giant\'s army. Seeing his men fall, he attacked the goddess in person; when\nfrom every drop of blood that fell from his body a thousand giants equal in\npower to himself arose. At this crisis another form of the goddess, named\nChandi, came to the rescue. As K\xc4\x81li drank the giant\'s blood and prevented the\nformation of new giants, Chandi slew the monster herself.\n\nK\xc4\x81li is represented as a black woman with four arms; in one hand she has a\nsword, in another the head of the giant she has slain, with the other two she\nis encouraging her worshippers. For earrings she has two dead bodies; wears a\nnecklace of skulls; her only clothing is a girdle made of dead men\'s hands,\nand her tongue protrudes from her mouth. Her eyes are red as those of a\ndrunkard, and her face and breasts are besmeared with blood. She stands with\none foot on the thigh, and another on the breast of her husband. This position\nof K\xc4\x81li is accounted for by the fact that, when her victory over the giants\nwas won, she danced for joy so furiously that the earth trembled beneath her\nweight. At the request of the gods Siva asked her to desist, but as, owing to\nher excitement, she did not notice him, he lay down amongst the slain. She\ncontinued dancing until she caught sight of her husband under her feet;\nimmediately she thrust out her tongue with shame at the disrespect she had\nshown him.\n\np. 310\n\nIn the "Adhyatma * R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana," \xe2\x80\xa0 is a legend giving quite a different origin of\nK\xc4\x81li; the object of the writer evidently being to enhance the glory of Sita,\nby showing that K\xc4\x81li was but a form that she had assumed. On R\xc4\x81ma\'s return\nfrom the destruction of R\xc4\x81vana, he was boasting of his prowess, when Sita\nsmiled and said, "You rejoice because you have slain Havana with ten\n\n[![KALI.](tn/31000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/31000.jpg)  \nKALI.  \n\nheads, but what would you say to a R\xc4\x81vana with a thousand?" "Destroy him too,"\nsaid R\xc4\x81ma. Sita advised him to remain at home; but he collected his army of\nmonkeys, and with his wife and brothers set off for Satadwipa to meet this new\nR\xc4\x81vana. Hanum\xc4\x81n\n\np. 311\n\nwas despatched to discover the residence of the monster, and to gather all the\ninformation he could about him, and on his return R\xc4\x81ma went to the attack. The\ngiant regarded the army of his assailant as so many children.\n\n[![K\xc4\x80LI DANCING ON SIVA.](tn/31100.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/31100.jpg)  \nK\xc4\x80LI DANCING ON SIVA.  \n\nHe shot three arrows. One of these sent all the monkeys to their home at\nKiskindha; a second drove the giants and demons to Lanka; whilst the third\ndespatched the soldiers to Ayodha, R\xc4\x81ma\'s capital. R\xc4\x81ma was thunderstruck as\nhe found himself alone, and, imagining that\n\np. 312\n\nall his forces were destroyed, began to weep. Sita, laughing at her husband,\nassumed the terrific form of K\xc4\x81li, and furiously attacked the thousand-headed\nR\xc4\x81vana. The conflict lasted ten years, but at length she slew the giant, drank\nhis blood, and began to dance and toss about the limbs of his lifeless body.\nHer dancing shook the earth to its centre; but not until Siva lay on the\nground, and her attention was called to the disrespect she was showing him,\ncould she be prevailed upon to desist. Thus Siva saved the universe; and Sita,\nassuming her proper form, went home with R\xc4\x81ma and his brothers.\n\nThe "Skanda Pur\xc4\x81na" * explains that Chandi, who came to the rescue and\nassisted K\xc4\x81li in the destruction of Raktavija, was a form of Devi, assumed on\nanother occasion for the destruction of Chanda. It is interesting to see that\nthese leaders of Sumbha\'s army reappear, although they were slain, and their\nblood was drunk by Singhav\xc4\x81hini. Two asuras, named Chanda and Manda, through a\nboon received from the divine mothers, became so powerful as to subdue the\nthree worlds. The gods besought Devi, who appeared to them under the form of\nChandi, to deliver them; she replied, "that she could do nothing for them\nuntil she had propitiated Siva." To accomplish this she retired to a forest,\nand, whilst engaged in worship, Siva first appeared, under the form of a vast\nLinga, and then, in answer to Chandi\'s prayer, revealed himself, and in answer\nto her praises thus addressed her: O goddess! Thou art celebrated in the three\nworlds as Parasakti (the energy of the supreme being). Wherever thou art,\nthere am I; and wherever I am, there is Chandik\xc4\x81. There is no difference\nbetween us. What shall I do for you? " Chandi replies:\n\np. 313\n\n[paragraph continues] "Formerly I slew Chanda and Manda in battle; but they\nhave been born again as mighty asuras, and have oppressed the three worlds. It\nis therefore to be enabled to destroy them that I seek thy protection." Siva\npromises his help, and sends her in the guise of a messenger to challenge them\nto fight. They accept the challenge, and are slain by Siva.\n\nThe "Linga Pur\xc4\x81na" * seems to teach that K\xc4\x81li, though produced by Durg\xc4\x81, was\nyet distinct from her. Formerly a female asura named D\xc4\x81ruk\xc4\x81 had through\ndevotion obtained such power that she consumed like fire the gods and\nBr\xc4\x81hmans. But as she was attended by a host of female asuras, Vishnu and the\ngods feared to attack her, lest they should be guilty of the great sin of\nslaying a woman. Siva is then appealed to, who, addressing Devi, said, "Let me\nrequest, O lovely one! that thou wouldst effect the destruction of this\nD\xc4\x81ruk\xc4\x81." P\xc4\x81rvati, having heard these words, created from her own substance a\nmaiden of black colour, with matted locks, having an eye in her forehead,\nbearing in her hand a trident and a skull; she was of aspect terrible to\nbehold, was arrayed in celestial garments, and adorned with all kinds of\nornaments. On beholding this terrific form of darkness, the gods retreated in\nalarm. P\xc4\x81rvati then created innumerable ghosts, goblins, and demons; attended\nby these, K\xc4\x81li, in obedience to her order, attacked and destroyed D\xc4\x81ruk\xc4\x81.\n\nMaurice \xe2\x80\xa0 gives another account of K\xc4\x81li: "The origin of this singular deity is\nperfectly in union with her life and history. Arrayed in complete armour, she\nsprang from the eye of the dreadful war-bred goddess Durg\xc4\x81, the vanquisher of\ndemons and giants, at the very instant\n\np. 314\n\nthat she was sinking under their united assaults. K\xc4\x81li joining her\nextraordinary powers to those of her parent, they renew the combat and rout\ntheir foes with great slaughter."\n\nThe "M\xc4\x81rkandeya Pur\xc4\x81na" * makes K\xc4\x81li a production of Lakshmi. The origin of\nall things is Mah\xc4\x81 Lakshmi, who visibly or invisibly pervades and dwells in\nall that is. Separating from herself the quality of darkness, she gave origin\nto a form black as night, with dreadful tusks and large eyes, and holding a\nsword, a goblet, a head and a shield, and adorned with a necklace of skulls.\nShe is distinguished by the names of Mah\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81li, Ek\xc4\x81vir\xc4\x81, K\xc4\x81lar\xc4\x81tri, and other\nsimilar appellations. Then from the quality of purity she produced Sarasvati.\nAs soon as they were formed, Mah\xc4\x81 Lakshmi thus addressed Mah\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81li and\nSarasvati: "Let us from our own forms produce twin deities." She then\ngenerated a male and female, named Brahm\xc4\x81 and Lakshmi; in the same manner\nMah\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81li produced Siva and Sarasvati, and Sarasvati produced Gauri and Vishnu.\nMah\xc4\x81 Lakshmi then gave in marriage Sarasvati to Brahm\xc4\x81, Gauri to Siva, and\nLakshmi to Vishnu.\n\nIn the accounts of the forms of Durg\xc4\x81, and also in those of the other deities,\nif the writer of the book is commending Lakshmi, as in the last quotation, she\nis declared to be the source of all: if the book is in praise of Durg\xc4\x81, she is\nequally declared to be the source. Unless this is borne in mind the varying\norigins of the deities become somewhat confusing. But when it is ascertained\non whose special behalf a book was written, it may be expected that he or she\nwill be described as the source, the greatest of all.\n\nThere can be no doubt that human sacrifices were\n\np. 315\n\nformerly offered to K\xc4\x81li, though now they are forbidden both by British law\nand the Hindu scriptures; the prohibition in Hindu books, however, is in a\nmore recent class of books than those in which they were ordained. In the\n"K\xc4\x81lika Pur\xc4\x81na," * from which the following extracts are made, nothing could\nbe clearer than the instruction regarding this cruel practice. Siva is\naddressing his sons the Bhairavas, initiating them in these terrible\nmysteries.\n\n"The flesh of the antelope and the rhinoceros give my beloved (K\xc4\x81li) delight\nfor five hundred years. By a human sacrifice, attended by the forms laid down,\nDevi is pleased for a thousand years; and by the sacrifice of three men, a\nhundred thousand years. By human flesh K\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81khy\xc4\x81, Chandik\xc4\x81, and Bhairav\xc4\x81, who\nassume my shape, are pleased a thousand years. An oblation of blood which has\nbeen rendered pure by holy texts, is equal to ambrosia; the head and flesh\nalso afford much delight to Chandik\xc4\x81. Blood drawn from the offerer\'s own body\nis looked upon as a proper oblation to the goddess Chandik\xc4\x81.\n\n"Let the sacrificer repeat the word K\xc4\x81li twice, and say, \'Hail, Devi! goddess\nof thunder; hail, iron-sceptred goddess!\' Let him then take the axe in his\nhand, and again invoke the same by the K\xc4\x81lar\xc4\x81tri text, as follows: Let the\nsacrificer say, Hrang, Hrang! K\xc4\x81li, K\xc4\x81li! O horrid-toothed goddess! Eat, cut,\ndestroy all the malignant; cut with this axe; bind, bind; seize, seize; drink\nblood! Spheng, spheng! secure, secure. Salutation to K\xc4\x81li.\' The axe being\ninvoked by this text, called the K\xc4\x81lar\xc4\x81tri Mantra, K\xc4\x81lar\xc4\x81tri herself presides\nover the axe, uplifted for the destruction of the sacrificer\'s enemies.\n\np. 316\n\n"Different mantras (or forms) are used in reference to the description of the\nvictim to be immolated. If a lion, this--\n\n"\'O Hari! who in the shape of a lion bearest Chandika, bear my evils and avert\nmy misfortunes. Thy shape, O lion! was assumed by Hari [in the Nrisingha\nincarnation of Vishnu] to punish the wicked part of the human race; and under\nthat form, by truth, the tyrant Hiranyakasipu was slain!\'\n\n"Females are not to be immolated, except on very particular occasions; the\nhuman female never.\n\n"Let princes, ministers of State, councillors, and vendors of spirituous\nliquors make human sacrifices, for the purpose of attaining prosperity and\nwealth. Let the victim offered to Devi, if a buffalo, be four years old; and\nif human, twenty-five. On these occasions this is the mantra to be used:\n\'Hail! three-eyed goddess, of most terrifying appearance, around whose neck a\nstring of human skulls is pendent; who art the destroyer of evil spirits; who\nart armed with an axe and a spear, salutation to thee with this blood.\'\n\n"An enemy may be immolated by proxy, substituting a buffalo or a goat, and\nCalling the victim by the name of the enemy through the whole ceremony,\nthereby infusing, by holy texts, the soul of the enemy into the body of the\nvictim; which will when immolated deprive the foe of life also. On this\noccasion, let the sacrificer say: \'O goddess of horrid forms! O Chandik\xc4\x81! Eat,\ndevour such an one my enemy. Consort of fire! salutation to fire. This is the\nenemy who has done me mischief, now personated by an animal--destroy him, O\nMah\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81ri!\'"\n\nA great variety of regulations and invocations, rites, etc., are laid down for\nthe performance of sanguinary\n\np. 317\n\nofferings, whether the immolation of a victim, or an offering of the\nsacrificer\'s own blood, or burning his flesh. Until very recent times\ncommonly, and in some quiet places even now, at certain festivals, the\nworshippers cut their flesh and burn their bodies in order to please this\ncruel deity. Before the Thugs set out on their murderous projects they first\nsacrificed to K\xc4\x81li to obtain her blessing; and, on their return, paid a\nportion of the spoils as an offering for her help.\n\n7\\. Muktakesi * (having flowing hair) destroyed another part of the giant\'s\nforces. In appearance there is little to distinguish her from K\xc4\x81li: she has\nfour arms; holds a sword and a helmet in her left hands, and with her right\nshe is bestowing a blessing and dispelling fear. She, too, is standing upon\nthe body of her husband.\n\n8\\. T\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81 (the saviour) slew Sumbha, and holds his head in one hand and a sword\nin another. Her appearance, too, is similar to that of K\xc4\x81li. She must not be\nconfounded with T\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81, the wife of Vrihaspati; or T\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81, the wife of B\xc4\x81li, the\nasura king.\n\n9\\. Chinnamustaka (the beheaded) slew Nisumbha, the other giant. It is evident\nfrom her appearance that she found her task rather difficult, for her head is\nhalf-severed from her body. She is painted as a fair woman, naked, and wearing\na garland of skulls, standing upon the body of her husband.\n\n10\\. Jagadgauri (the yellow woman [renowned] through the world) received the\nthanks and praises of the gods and men for the deliverance she wrought; in her\nfour hands she holds a conch-shell, a discus, a club, and a lotus.\n\nImages are made of Durg\xc4\x81 at different seasons of the\n\np. 318\n\nyear in nearly all of these forms, and various blessings are sought from her\nby her worshippers. In addition to these she is worshipped under other names;\nsome of the more generally known will now be given. It should be noticed that\nthe Hindus who worship Durg\xc4\x81 in any of her forms, and the other female\ndeities, when they represent the Sakti, or energy of their husbands, are\ncalled Saktas, and form a class distinct from the Hindus generally. An\nexception, however, must be made in respect to Sarasvati, Lakshmi, and the\nautumnal worship of Durg\xc4\x81; this particular form of worship being common to\nalmost all Hindus.\n\n11\\. Pratyangir\xc4\x81 (the well-proportioned one). Of this form of Durg\xc4\x81 no images\nare made, but at night the officiating priest, wearing red clothes, offers red\nflowers, liquors, and bloody sacrifices. The flesh of animals dipped in some\nintoxicating drink is burned; the worshipper believing that the flesh of the\nenemy for whose injury the ceremony is performed will swell, as the flesh of\nthe sacrifice swells in the fire.\n\n12\\. Annapurn\xc4\x81 (she who fills with food) is represented as a fair woman,\nstanding on a lotus, or as sitting on a throne. In one hand she holds a rice\nbowl, and in the other a spoon used for stirring rice when it is being boiled.\nSiva, as a mendicant, is receiving alms from her. She is the guardian deity of\nmany Hindus, who have a proverb to the effect that a sincere disciple of this\ndeity will never want rice. It is in connection with this form of Durg\xc4\x81 that\nthe "Linga Pur\xc4\x81na" * gives a legend explaining an image called\nArdhan\xc4\x81rishwara, which represents Siva and Durg\xc4\x81 as together forming one body.\nSiva as a mendicant supported his wife and children by begging; but on one\noccasion,\n\np. 319\n\nowing to his use of intoxicating. herbs, he was unable to go his rounds. Durg\xc4\x81\ntold him there was nothing in the house to eat; half the previous day\'s\ncontributions they had eaten; Ganesa\'s rat and Kartikeya\'s peacock\n\n[![ANNAPURN\xc4\x80](tn/31900.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/31900.jpg)  \nANNAPURN\xc4\x80  \n\nhaving finished the rest. Siva then went out to beg, and Durg\xc4\x81 started for her\nfather\'s house with the children, but was met by N\xc4\x81rada, who advised her, as\nAnnapurn\xc4\x81, to lay an embargo on the food of the houses where Siva asked for\nalms. The result was no one\n\np. 320\n\nwould give him anything. N\xc4\x81rada meeting him advised him to go home; Annapurn\xc4\x81\nmet him at the door, and so pleased him by giving him food, that he pressed\nher to his breast with such force that they became one body.\n\n13\\. Ganesajanani (the mother of Ganesa) is worshipped with her infant in her\narms.\n\n14\\. Krishnakrora (she who holds Krishna on her breast). When Krishna fought\nwith the serpent Kaliya in the river Yamuna, he was bitten, and in pain called\nupon Durg\xc4\x81 for help. She heard his cry, and, by suckling him from her breast,\nrestored him to health.\n\nThis list might be almost indefinitely enlarged. From the number of her names,\nit is evident she is largely worshipped in North India; and from the number of\nHindus bearing one or other of her names, it is certain she is most popular.\nIt is a common custom for the Hindus to give their children names indicating\nthe god or goddess through whose favour they are believed to have been given,\nand Durg\xc4\x81 seems to have had a part in the bestowal of a very large proportion\nof the children in Bengal. "By the favour of K\xc4\x81li, or Durg\xc4\x81, or T\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81," is\nexpressed in the names of multitudes, and every day witnesses the payment of\nvows made to this goddess when some desired good is granted, or threatened\nevil averted.\n\n##### THE SAKTIS.\n\nAlthough a full account of the three chief goddesses, Sarasvati, Lakshmi, and\nP\xc4\x81rvati, has already been given, there still remains something to be said in\norder to indicate the position they occupy in the Pantheon. By far the greater\npart of the Hindus in Bengal, and a\n\np. 321\n\nconsiderable number in other provinces, devote their chief, almost their\nexclusive worship to the wives of the gods rather than to their husbands; and\nby these people they are declared to be the source and support of all things.\nOf the three, P\xc4\x81rvati, chiefly in her more dreadful forms, is by far the most\npopular. Comparatively few assign to the other two a similarly exalted\nposition.\n\nAll the Hindus acknowledge the consorts of the gods in a general way, and on\nthe days commonly devoted to their worship are careful to present the\ncustomary offerings. But the sects now under consideration are not content\nwith this. As the goddesses fill their field of vision, their husbands are\nalmost entirely neglected. Originally the term Sakti signified the energy, or\npower of a deity. In process of time this energy was supposed to dwell in the\nwife, and as a result the devotion of the worshippers was transferred to her.\nAnd for many centuries a special name has been given to those who pay their\nsupreme worship to the energy of the gods that are, so to speak, incarnated in\ntheir wives. These are known as Saktas, just as those who make Siva their\nchief object of adoration are Saivites; or those who regard Vishnu as the\nsupreme are Vaishnavas.\n\nThere is a respectable and recognized cult of Sakti worship, known as the\nright-handed; and there is one that is quite the opposite, known as the left-\nhanded. The rites and ceremonies in the one case are openly performed, and do\nnot greatly differ from those in common with other Hindu sects. But amongst\nthe left-handed sects the greatest care is taken to keep secret, from the\nuninitiated, the doctrines and practices that regulate and form their worship.\nBut enough is known to make the members generally ashamed of their\n\np. 322\n\nconnection with the system. Meat, strictly prohibited by ordinary Hinduism,\nintoxicating drinks, also strictly forbidden by the same authority, and\ngrossly obscene acts are performed as part of the worship that is offered to\nthe deity. Of old, without doubt, human sacrifices were offered at such\nfestivals. But as this forms part of Hindu worship, rather than of mythology,\nit does not call for further notice here. The goddesses, and especially Devi,\nor Durg\xc4\x81, the wife of Siva, are the supreme objects of worship amongst the\nSaktas; and they are worshipped as the incarnation of the energy or force of\ntheir divine husbands. The authority for this form of Hinduism are the\nTantras, not the Pur\xc4\x81nas. As in the case of the more modern deities an attempt\nis made to identify them with the older, so expressions in the more ancient\nbooks are caught up and explained in such a way as to make it appear that the\nTantric teaching is in harmony with, or a legitimate development of them.\n\n![](img/32200.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[286:*](hmvp34.htm#fr_257) Muir, O.
