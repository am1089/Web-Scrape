On the full-moon day of \xc3\x82 _s_ vayu _g_ a milk-rice sacred to Rudra (is\nprepared).\n\n2\\. He should offer it with (the Mantra), 'Not to our children.'\n\n3\\. Let him pour \xc3\x82 _g_ ya into milk; this is called a P _ri_ shataka.\n\n4\\. Therewith he should besprinkle the cows when they have come home, with\n(the Mantra), 'May Mitra and Varu _n_ a' (Sama-veda I, 220).\n\n5\\. That night he should let the calves join their mothers.\n\n6\\. At the sacrifice of the first-fruits, milk-rice sacred to Indra and Agni\n(is prepared).\n\n7\\. Let him sacrifice \xc3\x82 _g_ ya with the four (verses), 'To the bearer of the\nhundred weapons' (MB. II, 1, 9 seqq.),\n\n8\\. And afterwards with (the verse), 'May Agni eat' (l.l. 15).\n\n9\\. All of them who have received the initiation, should eat the remainder of\nthat (sacrificial food).\n\n10\\. Having 'spread under' water, he should cut off two portions of the new\nfruits.\n\n3, 1. a _s_ vayu _g_ i _m_ Rudraya payaso. 2. ma nas toka iti _g_ uhuyat. 3.\npayasy avanayed a _g_ ya _m_ tat p _ri_ shataka _m_. 4. tenabhyagata ga ukshed\na no Mitravaru _n_ eti. 5. vatsa _m_ _s_ _k_ a mat _ri_ bhis saha vasayet ta\n_m_ ratri _m_. 6. navaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ e payasa aindragna _h_. 7. _s_ atayudhayeti\n_k_ atas _ri_ bhir a _g_ ya _m_ _g_ uhuyad. 8. uparish _t_ ad Agni _h_ pra _s_\nnatv iti _k_ a. 9. tasya _s_ esha _m_ pra _s_ niyur yavanta upeta. 10.\nupastiryapo dvir navasyavadyet.\n\np. 416\n\n11\\. Three (portions are cut off) by descendants of Bh _ri_ gu.\n\n12\\. Over (these portions) water (is poured).\n\n13\\. He should swallow (some part of that food) three times without chewing\nit, with (the Mantra), 'From the good' (l.l. 13);\n\n14\\. Or at (the partaking of) barley with (the Mantra), 'This barley' (l.l.\n16).\n\n15\\. With (the Mantra), This art thou' (l.l. 14), let him touch the different\nsense-organs at his head.\n\n16 16-31. The \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ a ceremony has been explained by the _S_ rava _n_ a\n(ceremony).\n\n17\\. Let him (not?) murmur (the Mantra), 'Adoration to the Earth' (see chap.\n2, 6).\n\n18\\. In the evening let him make an oblation of milk-rice with (the verse),\n'As the first' (MB. II, 2, 1).\n\n19\\. Turning downwards his two hands (so as to touch the sacrificial grass) he\nshould murmur (the Mantra), 'In worldly strength' (l.l. 2, 3).\n\n20\\. Having spread out to the west of the fire a layer of northward-pointed\ngrass, so that it is inclined towards the north, the householder sits down on\nthat layer,\n\n21\\. (And) the other persons in due order.\n\n22\\. Then, without an interval, their wives,\n\n11\\. trir Bh _ri_ gu _n_ am. 12. apa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ oparish _t_ ad. 13. bhadran na\nity asa _m_ khadya pragiret tris trir. 14. etam u tyam iti va yavanam. 15.\namo\xe0\xa4\xbdsiti mukhyan pra _n_ an abhim _ri_ _s_ ed. 16. agrahaya _n_ a _m_ karma\n_s_ rava _n_ enaiva vyakhyata _m_. 17. nama _h_ P _ri_ thivya iti _g_ apet\n(read, iti na _g_ apet?). 18. pradoshe payasasya _g_ uhuyat prathameti. 19.\nnya _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ au pa _n_ i k _ri_ tva prati kshatra iti _g_ apet. 20. pa _s_ _k_\nad agne svastaram udagagrais t _ri_ _n_ air udakprava _n_ am astirya tasminn\nastara _n_ e g _ri_ hapatir aste. 21. \xe0\xa4\xbdnupurvam itare. 22. \xe0\xa4\xbdnantara bharya\n_h_.\n\np. 417\n\n23\\. And their children.\n\n24\\. The householder, turning his hands downwards (so as to touch the layer of\ngrass), should murmur (the Mantra), 'Be soft' (l.l. 4).\n\n25\\. When he has finished that (verse), they should lie down on their right\nsides. They should turn round three times, turning themselves towards\nthemselves (i.e. turning round forwards, not backwards, and thus returning to\ntheir former position?).\n\n26\\. Let them repeat the auspicious hymns.\n\n27\\. Then let them do what they like.\n\n28\\. The eighth days of the three dark fortnights after the \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ i are\ncalled the Ash _t_ akas.\n\n29\\. On (each of) these a mess of cooked food (is sacrificed),\n\n30\\. And eight cakes on the first.\n\n31\\. These he should bake in a dish without turning them round.\n\n32 32-33. On the last (Ash _t_ aka) vegetables (are offered). (So also) at the\nAnvaharya ( _S_ raddha).\n\n33\\. Let him sacrifice with (the formula), 'To the Ash _t_ aka Svaha!'\n\n23\\. putra _s_ _k_ a. 24. nya _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ au pa _n_ i k _ri_ tva syoneti g _ri_\nhapatir _g_ apet. 25. samaptaya _m_ dakshi _n_ ai _h_ par _s_ vai _h_ sa _m_\nvi _s_ eyus tris trir abhyatmam av _ri_ tya. 26. svastyayanani kuryus. 27.\ntato yathartha _m_ syad. 28. urdhvam agrahaya _n_ yas tisras tamisrash _t_\namyo \xe0\xa4\xbdsh _t_ aka ity a _k_ akshate. 29. tasu sthalipaka. 30. ash _t_ au _k_\napupa _h_ prathamaya _m_. 31. tan aparivartayan kapale _s_ rapayed. 32.\nuttamaya _m_ _s_ akam anvaharye. 33. \xe0\xa4\xbdsh _t_ akayai svaheti _g_ uhuyat.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[415:1-15](sbe29220.htm#fr_1031) 3, 1-15 = Gobhila III, 8 (3 deest).\n\n[416:16-31](sbe29220.htm#fr_1032) 16-31 = III, 9 and 10, 1-17 (29 deest).\n\n[417:32-33](sbe29220.htm#fr_1033) 32, 33 = IV, 4, 17. 21.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4](sbe29221.htm)\n\n"
