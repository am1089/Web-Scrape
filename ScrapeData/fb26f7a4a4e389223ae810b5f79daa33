To the effected (Brahman) (the souls are led); (thus opines) Badari;\nbecause going to him is possible.\n\nWith regard to the passage, 'He leads them to Brahman.'\n\np. 390\n\nthe doubt arises whether that person leads the souls to the effected, lower,\nBrahman, or to the highest, non-modified, chief Brahman.--Whence the doubt?--\nBecause the (ambiguous) word Brahman is used, and because scripture speaks of\ngoing.--The opinion of the teacher Badari is that the person, who is not a\nman, leads them to the lower, qualified, effected Brahman; because it is\npossible to go to that. For the effected Brahman which occupies a definite\nplace can be the goal of a journey. With the highest Brahman, on the other\nhand, we cannot connect the ideas of one who goes, or object of going, or act\nof going; for that Brahman is present everywhere and is the inner Self of all.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 8](sbe38309.htm)\n\n"
