And the goblin said to him: "O\nKing, you are wise and good, so I am pleased with you. To amuse you,\ntherefore, I will tell you another story with a puzzle in it. Listen."\n\n\n\nLong ago there was a king named Glory-banner in the world. His city was named\nBeautiful. And in this city was a splendid temple to the goddess Gauri. And to\nthe right of the temple was a lake called Bath of Gauri. And on a certain day\nin each year a great crowd of people came there on a pilgrimage from all\ndirections to bathe.\n\nOne day a laundryman named White came there from another village to bathe. And\nthe youth saw a maiden who had also come there to bathe. Her name was Lovely,\nand her father\'s name was Clean-cloth. She robbed the moon of its beauty and\nWhite of his heart. So he inquired about her name and family and went home\nlovesick.\n\nWhen he got there, he was ill and could not eat without her. And when his\nmother asked him, he told her what was in his heart, but did not change his\nhabits. But she went and told her husband, whose name was Spotless.\n\nSo Spotless went and saw how his son was acting, and said: "My son, why should\nyou be downcast? Your desire is not hard to obtain. For if I ask Clean-cloth,\nhe will surely give you his daughter. We are not inferior to him in birth,\nwealth, or social position. I know him and he knows me. So there is no\ndifficulty about it." Thus Spotless comforted his son, made him eat and take\ncare of himself, went with him the next day to Clean-cloth\'s house, and asked\nthat the girl might be given to his son White. And Clean-cloth graciously\npromised to give her to him.\n\nThen when the time came, Clean-cloth gave White his charming daughter, a wife\nworthy of him. And when he was married, White went happily to his father\'s\nhouse with his sweet bride.\n\nNow as he lived there happily, Lovely\'s brother came to visit. And when they\nhad all asked him about his health and his sister had greeted him with a kiss,\nand after he had rested, he said: "My father sent me to invite Lovely and\nWhite to a festival in our house." And all the relatives said it was a good\nplan and entertained him that day with appropriate things to drink and eat.\n\nThe next morning White set out for his father-in-law\'s house, together with\nhis brother-in-law and Lovely. And when he came to the city Beautiful, he saw\nthe great temple of Gauri. And he said to Lovely and her brother: "We will see\nthis goddess. I will go first and you two stay here." So White went in to see\nthe goddess. He entered the temple and bowed before the goddess whose eighteen\narms had killed the horrible demons, whose lotus-feet were set upon a giant\nthat she had crushed.\n\nAnd when he had worshipped her, an idea suddenly came to him. "People honour\nthis goddess with all kinds of living sacrifices. Why should I not win her\nfavour by sacrificing myself?" And he fetched a sword from a deserted inner\nroom, cut off his own head, and let it fall on the floor.\n\nPresently his brother-in-law entered the temple to see why he delayed so long.\nAnd when he saw his brother-in-law with his head cut off, he went mad with\ngrief, and cut off his own head in the same way with the same sword.\n\nThen when he failed to come out, Lovely was alarmed and entered the temple.\nAnd when she saw her husband and her brother in that condition, she cried:\n"Alas! This is the end of me!" and fell weeping to the floor. But presently\nshe rose, lamenting for the pair so unexpectantly dead, and thought: "What is\nmy life good for now?"\n\nBefore killing herself, she prayed to the goddess: "O Goddess! One only deity\nof happiness and character! Partaker of the life of Shiva! Refuge of all\nwomen-folk! Destroyer of grief! Why have you killed my husband and my brother\nat one fell swoop? It was not right, for I was always devoted to you. Then be\nmy refuge when I pray to you, and hear my one pitiful prayer. I shall leave\nthis wretched body of mine on this spot, but in every future life of mine, O\nGoddess, may I have the same husband and brother." Thus she prayed, praised,\nand worshipped the goddess, then tied a rope to an ashoka tree which grew\nthere.\n\nBut while she was arranging the rope about her neck, a voice from heaven\ncried: "Do nothing rash, my daughter. Leave the rope alone. Though you are\nyoung, I am pleased with your unusual goodness. Place the two heads on the two\nbodies and they shall rise up again and live through my favour."\n\nSo Lovely left the rope alone and joyfully went to the bodies. But in her\ngreat hurry and confusion she made a mistake. She put her husband\'s head on\nher brother\'s body and her brother\'s head on her husband\'s body. Then they\narose, sound and well, like men awaking from a dream. And they were all\ndelighted to hear one another\'s  adventures, worshipped the goddess, and went\non their way.\n\nNow as she walked along, Lovely noticed that she had made a mistake in their\nheads. And she was troubled and did not know what to do.\n\n\n\nWhen the goblin had told this story, he asked the king: "O King, when they\nwere mingled in this way, which should be her husband? If you know and do not\ntell, then the curse I spoke of will be fulfilled."\n\nAnd the king said to the goblin: "The body with the husband\'s head on it is\nher husband. For the head is the most important member. It is by the head that\nwe recognize people."\n\nThen the goblin slipped from the king\'s shoulder as before, and quickly\ndisappeared. And the king went back, determined to catch him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Seventh Goblin: The Mutual Services of King Fierce-lion and Prince\nGood. Which is the more deserving?](ttg08.htm)\n\n'
