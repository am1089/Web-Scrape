S'ri Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Child Narada! Now hear in detail about the\ndivisions of the earth into the Dvipas and the Var _s_ as as marked out by the\nDevas. In brief, I describe about them; no one can speak about this in\ndetails. First, the Jambu Dvipa is one lakh Yoyanas in its dimensions. This\nJambu Dvipa is round like a lotus. There are nine Var _s_ as in it and\nexcepting the Bhadras'va and Ketumala, each is nine thousand Yoyanas in its\ndimensions (i.e., in its diameter or circumference?) and there are eight very\nlofty mountains, in those Var _s_ as, forming their boundaries. Of the Var _s_\nas, the two Var _s_ as that are situated in the North and South, are of the\nsize of a bow (segmental); and the four others are elongated in their size.\nThe centre of all these Var _s_ as is named \xc3\x8elavrita Var _s_ a and its size is\nrectangular. In the centre of this \xc3\x8elavar _s_ a is situated the golden Sumeru\nMountain, the King of all the mountains, one lakh Yoyanas high. It forms the\npericarp of the lotus earth. The top of this mountain is thirty Yoyanas wide.\nO Child! The sixteen thousand Yoyanas of this mountain is under the ground and\nthe eighty four Yoyanas are visible outside. In the north of this \xc3\x8elavar _s_ a\nare the three mountains the Nilagiri, the S'vetagiri and the S'ringavau,\nforming the boundaries respectively of the three Var _s_ as named Ramyaka,\nHira _n_ maya and Kuru respectively. These run along from the east and\ngradually extend at their base and towards the salt ocean (Lavana Samudra).\n\n\n\np. 751\n\n\n\nThese three mountains, that form the boundaries, are each two thousand Yoyanas\nwide. The length of each from the east towards north is less by one-tenth\n(1/10) of the above dimensions. Many rivers take their source and flow from\nthem. On the south of \xc3\x8elavar _s_ a three beautiful mountain ranges, named Ni\n_s_ adha, Hemakuta, and Himalayas, are situated, extending from the east. They\nare each one Ayuta Yoyanas high. These three mountains form the boundaries\nagain of Kimpuru _s_ a and Bharata Var _s_ a.\n\n\n\nTo the west of \xc3\x8elavrita is situated the mountain called Malyavan and to the\neast are situated the mountains Gandhamadan, Nila, and Ni _s_ adha, the\ncentres of the highest sublime grandeur and beauty. The length and breadth of\nthese the boundary (limiting) mountains are each two thousand Yoyanas. Then\nthe mountains Mandara, Supars'vak, and Kumuda and others are situated in the\nKetumala and Bhadras'va Var _s_ as; but these all are reckoned as the Pada\nParvatas (mountains at the foot) of the Sumeru mountain. The height and\nbreadth of each of these is one Ayuta Yoyanas. These form the pillars, as it\nwere, of Meru on the four sides. On these mountains, the mangoe, the jack,\nplantain, and the fig trees and various others are situated, four hundred\n(400) Yoyanas wide and eleven hundred (1,100) Yoyanas high; they seem to\nextend to the Heavens and form, as it were, the flagstaffs on the top. The\nroots, bases of these trees as well as their branches are wonderfully equally\nthick and extend to enormous distances. On those mountain tops are situated\nagain, the four very capacious lakes. Of these, one lake is all milk; the\nother lake is all honey; the third lake is all sugarcane juice and the fourth\nlake is all sweet water. There are, then, again the four very lovely gardens\nnamed Nandana, Chaitrarath, Vaibhrajaka, and Sarvatobhadra, very lovely,\nenchanting and pleasing to the delicate female sex and where the Devas enjoy\nthe wealth and prosperity and their other Yogic powers. Here the Devas live\nalways with numerous hordes of women and have their free amorous, dealings\nwith them, to their heart's contents and they hear the sweet songs sung by the\nGandharbas and Kinnaras, the Upa Devatas about their own glorious deeds. On\nthe top of the Mandara mountain, there are the Heavenly mangoe trees eleven\nhundred Yoyanas high; the sweet delicious nectarlike mangoe fruits, very soft\nand each of the size as the summit of a mountain, fall to the ground; and out\nof their juices of a colour of the rising sun, a great river named Aru _n_ oda\ntakes her origin. Here the Devas always worship the great Devi Bhagavati named\nAru _n_ a, the Destructrix of all sins, the Grantrix of all desires, and the\nBestower of all fearlessness with various offerings and with the lovely water\nof this Aru _n_ oda river, with great devotion. O Child! In ancient days, the\nKing of the Daityas worshipped always this Maha\n\n\n\np. 752\n\n\n\nMaya Aru _n_ a Devi (and obtained immense wealth and prosperity). He who\nworships Her becomes cured of all diseases, gets his health and other\nhappiness by Her grace. Therefore She is named \xc3\x82dya, Maya, Atula, Ananta, Pu\n_st_ i, \xc3\x8es'varamalini, the Destroyer of the wicked and the Giver of lustre and\nbeauty and thus remembered on this capacious earth. The river Jambunada has\ncome out, as a result of Her worship, containing divine gold.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the description of the\nreceptacle of beings and on the mountains and on the origin of rivers in the\nMaha Pura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 6](bk08ch06.htm)\n\n"
