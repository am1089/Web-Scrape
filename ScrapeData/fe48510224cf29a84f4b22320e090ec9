Suta said :-- Hearing the words of the Devas, Agastya, the Best of the\nBrahmi _n_ s promised that he would carry out their works. O Ri _s_ is! All\nthe Devas then became very glad when the Muni, born of the water jar, promised\nthus. They then bade good-bye to him and went back gladly to their own abodes.\nThe Muni then spoke to his wife thus :-- \xc2\x93O daughter of the King! The Bindhya\nMountain has baffled the progress of the Sun's course and has thus caused a\ngreat mischief. What the Munis, the Seers of truths said before referring to\nKas\xc2\x92i, all are now coming to my mind when I am thinking why this disturbance\nhas overtaken me. They said that various hindrances would come to him at every\nstep, who is a Sadhu intending to settle at Kas'i. Let him who wants Mukti,\nnever quit Kas'i, the Avimukta place in any case. But, O Dear! Today I have\ngot one hindrance during my stay at Kas'i.\xc2\x94 Thus talking with much regret on\nvarious subjects with his wife, the Muni bathed in the Ma _n_ ikar _n_ ika\nghat, saw the Lord Vis'ves'vara worshipped Dan _d_ apani and went to the Kala\nBhairava. He said in the following terms :-- \xc2\x93O Mighty armed Kalabhairava!\nThou destroyest the fear of the Bhaktas; Thou art the God of this Kas'i City.\nThen why art Thou driving me away from this Kas'idham. O Lord! Thou removest\nall the obstacles of the devotees and Thou preservest them. Then why, O\nDestroyer of the sorrows of the Bhaktas! art Thou removing me from here? Never\nI blamed others; nor did I practise any hypocrisy with any person nor did I\nlie; then under what sin, Thou art driving me away from Kas'i.\xc2\x94 O Ri _s_ is!\nThus praying to Kala Bhairava, the Muni Agastya, born of water jar and the\nhusband of Lopamudra, went to Sak _s_ i Ga _n_ es'a, the Destroyer of all\nevils and seeing and worshipping Him, went out of Kas'i and proceeded to the\nsouth. The Muni, the ocean of great fortune, left Kas'i; but he became very\nmuch distressed to leave it and he remembered it always. He began to march on\nwith his wife. As if riding on his car of asceticism he arrived at the Bindhya\nmountain in the twinkling of an eye and saw that the Mountain had risen very\nhigh and obstructed the passage of the Sun in the Heavens. The Bindhya\nMountain, seeing the Muni Agastya in front, began to tremble and as if\ndesirous to speak something to the earth in a whisper became low and dwarfish\nand bowed down to the Muni and fell down with devotion in sa _st_ angas with\ndevotion just like a stick dropped flat on the ground before the Muni.\n\n\n\np. 1033\n\n\n\nSeeing the Bindhya thus low, the Muni Agastya became pleased and spoke with a\ngracious look :-- \xc2\x93O Child! Better remain in this state until I come back.\nFor, O Child! I am quite unable to ascend to your lofty heights.\xc2\x94 Thus saying,\nthe Muni became eager to go to the south; and, crossing the peaks of the\nBindhya, alighted gradually again to the plains. He went on further to the\nsouth and saw the S\xc2\x92ri S'aila Mountain and at last went to the Malayachala and\nthere, building his \xc3\x82s'rama (hermitage), settled himself. O Saunaka! The Devi\nBhagavati, worshipped by the Muni went to the Bindhya Mountain and settled\nthere and became known, in the three worlds, by the name of Bindhyavasini.\n\n\n\n22-26. Suta said :-- Anybody who hears this highly pure narrative of the Muni\nAgastya and Bindhya, becomes freed of all his sins. All his enemies are\ndestroyed in no time. This hearing gives knowledge to the Brahma _n_ as,\nvictory to the K _s_ attriyas, wealth and corn to the Vais'yas and happiness\nto the S\xc2\x92udras.\n\n\n\nIf anybody once hears this narrative, he gets Dharma if he want Dharma, gets\nunbounded wealth if he wants wealth and gets all desires if he wants his\ndesires fulfilled. In ancient times Svayambhuva Manu worshipped this Devi with\ndevotion and got his kingdom for his own Manvantara period. O Saunaka! Thus I\nhave described to you the holy character of the Devi in this Manvantara. What\nmore shall I say? Mention please.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventh Chapter of the Tenth Book on the checking of the rise of\nthe Bindhya Range in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 8](bk10ch08.htm)\n\n"
