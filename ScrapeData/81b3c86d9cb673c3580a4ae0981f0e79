Whatever the outcome of the\nnegotiations for peace, one thing is sure: for better, for worse, and whether\nwe will or no, the West must know the East, and the East must know the West.\nWith that knowledge will inevitably come an interchange of potent influences,\nof influences that will affect profoundly the religion and morals, the\nphilosophy, the literature, the art, in short, all the elements that make up\nthe civilizations of the two hemispheres. It is a part of the responsibility\nresting upon the molders and leaders of the thought and life of our time, and\nupon our Universities in particular, to see to it that these new forces,\nmighty for good or for evil, are directed aright._\n\n_The fruitfulness of those scions of Western civilization which the Japanese\nhave grafted upon their own stock is to-day the admiration of the world. In\nour wonder, let us not forget that that stock is the growth of centuries, and\nthat it is rooted in a soil of racial character informed by ethical ideals\nwhich we are wont to regard, with arrogant self-complacency, as exclusively\nproper to Christianity, but which were, in fact, inculcated twenty four\ncenturies ago through precept and example by Gotama the Enlightened, or, as\nthe Hindus called him, Gotama the Buddha. It has often been said that India\nhas never influenced the development of humanity as a whole. Be that as it\nmay, it now seems no less probable than strange that she is yet destined to do\nso, on the one hand, indirectly, through the influence of Indian Buddhism upon\nJapan, and, on the other, directly, by the diffusion in the West of a\nknowledge of her sacred writings, especially_  \n\np. x\n\n_those of Vedantism and Buddhism. To judge the East aright, we must know not\nonly what she is, but also how she has become what she is; know, in short,\nsome of the principal phases of her spiritual history as they are reflected in\nher ancient literature, especially that of India. To interpret to the West the\nthought of the East, to bring her best and noblest achievements to bear upon\nour life, \xc2\x97that is today the problem of Oriental philology._\n\n_The Harvard Oriental Series embodies an attempt to present to Western\nscholars, in trustworthy texts and translations, some of the greatest works of\nthe Hindu literature and philosophy and religion, together with certain\ninstruments, such as the Vedic Concordance. or the History of the Beast fable,\nfor their critical study or elucidation. Some account of the volumes completed\nor in progress may be found at the end of this book. Dr. Ryder, passing by for\nthe present the more momentous themes of religion and philosophy, has in this\nvolume attempted to show what the Indian genius, in its strength and in its\nweakness, could do in the field of literature pure and simple. The timeliness\nof the Series as a whole is an eloquent tribute to the discernment of my loved\nand unforgotten pupil and friend, Henry Clarke Warren. In him were united not\nonly the will and the ability to establish such a publication as this, but\nalso the learning and insight which enabled him to forecast in a general way\nits possibilities of usefulness. He knew that the East had many a lesson to\nteach the West; but whether the lesson be repose of spirit or hygiene of the\nsoldier in the field, whether it be the divine immanence or simplicity of life\nor the overcoming of evil with good, he knew that the first lesson to be\ntaught us was the teachable habit of mind_.\n\nC.
