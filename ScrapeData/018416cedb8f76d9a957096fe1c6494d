Having gone some distance, standing under the shade of\na kudum tree, playing on the flute, and calling all the cowherds\' children, he\nsaid, "Brothers! this is a nice place, why need [we](errata.htm#0) go farther?\nlet us sit down here and eat."\n\nOn hearing this, they drove away the calves to graze, and having brought\nleaves of different trees, and made them into plates and cups, sweeping the\nplace clean, they sat down in rows on all sides of Krishnu, and producing\ntheir provisions, began to serve them out.\n\nWhen they had finished serving them out, Shree Krishnu standing in the midst,\nhaving first himself taken a mouthful, gave the order for them to eat. They\nbegan to eat; and amongst them, Shree Krishnu with a peacock crown, a necklace\nof various flowers reaching to his feet, with a club in his hand, standing\nawry, and dressed in yellow silk, laughing gave them all some of his own food;\nand taking some from the plate of each, tasting it he pronounced upon the\ndifferent flavours; the bitter, sweet, hot and pungent; and appeared as\nbeautiful in that assembly, as the moon among the stars. At this time\n\np. 54\n\n[paragraph continues] Bruhmu and all the gods seated in their chariots looked\ndown from the sky on the enjoyments of the cowherds\' assembly. Bruhmu, having\ncome down from amongst them, stole and took away all the calves; and whilst\nthe cowherds were eating, happening to think about them, they said to Krishnu,\n"Brother! we are sitting here at our ease, and eating; who knows where the\ncalves may have gone to?"\n\nThen Krishnu said to the cowherds, "Do you all remain feasting; let no one get\nup, or be at all anxious; I will collect the calves belonging to all, and\nbring them here."\n\nHaving thus said, and gone some distance into the jungle, when he found out\nthat Bruhmu had stolen and carried off the calves, Shree Krishnu made others\nexactly like them, and brought them with him. On his return, he perceived that\nBruhmu had taken off the cowherds\' children also. He then also created other\nchildren, exactly like those that had been taken away; and as it was evening,\nbrought them all with him to Brindabun. The cowherds\' children went to their\nhomes, but none discovered the secret, that the children did not belong to\nthem; on the contrary, affection for them increased daily. Having narrated\nthus much, Shree Shookdeo said,--O great king! Bruhmu having taken off the\ncowherds\' children and calves, shutting them up in a mountain cave, and\nblocking up the entrance with a stone, fell into a state of forgetfulness\nregarding the circumstance; and Shree Krishnu constantly engaged in new\nsports. After the lapse of a year, Bruhmu recollected what he had done, and\nbegan to say to himself, "One of my moments has not passed, but a year of\nmortals has elapsed; I must therefore go and see what has been the state of\nBruj without the cowherds\' children and the calves."\n\nThinking thus, he rose and came to the cave, where he had shut them all up.\nHaving raised the stone, he saw, that the children and the calves had fallen\ninto a deep sleep. Departing thence, and coming to Brindabun, when he beheld\nthe children and calves exactly as before, he was astonished, and\n\np. 55\n\nbegan to say, "How have the cowherds and calves come here, or has Krishnu\ncreated these new ones?" Saying this he went again to look at the cave. Whilst\nhe was looking at them, Krishnu created such a delusion, that all the\ncowherds\' children and calves became four-armed, and Bruhmu, Roodru and Indru\nwith hands joined, stood before each. Bruhmu, on beholding, became like a\npicture: all intelligence and thoughts were forgotten (that is departed from\nhim) just as a stone Dewee with four faces would be grieved without\nworshippers and worship.\n\nAnd being frightened, and shutting his eyes, he began to tremble. When Shree\nKrishnu, acquainted with the secret thoughts of all, found that Bruhmu was\nvery much alarmed, he took away the parts of which the rest were composed, and\nremained himself alone, just as separate clouds are formed into one.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XV](psa16.htm)\n\n'
