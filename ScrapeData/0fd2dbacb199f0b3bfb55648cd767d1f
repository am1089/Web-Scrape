There is no restriction (since) all (have to go on that path). (Thus)\nthere is non-contradiction of sacred text and Sm _ri_ ti.\n\nThe question here is whether Brahman is to be reached on the path of the gods\nby those only who take their stand on those meditations which, like the Upako\n_s_ ala-vidya, describe that path, or by all who practise any of the\nmeditations on Brahman. The Purvapakshin holds the former view, since there is\nno proof to show that in other vidyas the going on that path is not mentioned,\nand since those other vidyas-such as the texts 'and those who in the forest\nmeditate on faith and austerities,'and' those who in the forest worship faith,\nthe True' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 10, 1; B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 15)--suggest to the mind\nthe idea of the knowledge of Brahman. This the Sutra negatives.\n\np. 652\n\n[paragraph continues] There is no restriction to that limited class of\ndevotees, since all who carry on meditations have to go on that path. For on\nthis latter assumption only text and inference, i.e. scripture and\nauthoritative tradition, are not contradicted. As to scripture, the _Kh_\nandogya and the Va _g_ asaneyaka alike, in the Pa _\xc3\xb1 k_agni-vidya, declare\nthat all those who practise meditation go on that path. In the Va _g_\nasaneyaka the words 'who know this' refer to those who practise the meditation\non the five fires, while the following words 'those who in the forest meditate\non faith and the True' refer to those who meditate on Brahman; and the text\nthen goes on to say that all those devotees go to Brahman, on the path of the\ngods. Texts such as 'the True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman,' and 'the True\nmust be enquired into,' prove that the term 'the True' denotes Brahman; and as\nin the _Kh_ andogya the term 'tapas ' occurs in the corresponding place, we\nconclude that both these terms, viz. _the True_ and tapas, denote nothing else\nbut Brahman. Meditation on Brahman, preceded by faith, is mentioned elsewhere\nalso; in the text which begins 'The True must be enquired into' we read\nfurther on 'Faith must be enquired into' ( _Kh._ Up. VII, 18, 16; 19). Sm _ri_\nti also declares that all those who know Brahman proceed on the path of the\ngods, 'Fire, the light, the day, the bright fortnight, the six months of the\nsun's northern progress--proceeding by that road those who know Brahman go to\nBrahman' (Bha. Gi. VIII, 24). And there are many other _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti\npassages of this kind. The conclusion therefore is that the Upako _s_ alavidya\nand similar texts merely refer to that going of the soul which is common to\nall vidyas.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'non-restriction.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 33.
