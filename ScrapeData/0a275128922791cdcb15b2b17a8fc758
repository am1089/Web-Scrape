At that moment a very big fish jumped about in the bottom of the\nbasket.\n\n"Is it a he or a she?" inquired the Queen. "I wish to purchase a she-fish."\n\nOn hearing this the fish laughed aloud.\n\n"It\'s a he," replied the fisherwoman, and proceeded on her rounds.\n\nThe Queen returned to her room in a great rage; and on coming to see her in\nthe evening, the King noticed that something had disturbed her.\n\n"Are you indisposed?" he said.\n\n"No; but I am very much annoyed at the strange behaviour of a fish. A woman\nbrought me one to-day, and on my inquiring whether it was a male or female,\nthe fish laughed most rudely."\n\n"A fish laugh! Impossible! You must be dreaming."\n\n"I am not a fool. I speak of what I have seen with my own eyes and have heard\nwith my own ears."\n\n"Passing strange! Be it so. I will inquire, concerning it."\n\nOn the morrow the King repeated to his vizier what his wife had told him, and\nbade him investigate the matter, and be ready with a satisfactory answer\nwithin six months, on pain of death. The vizier promised to do his best,\nthough he felt almost certain of failure. For five months he laboured\nindefatigably to find a reason for the laughter of the fish. He sought\neverywhere and from every one. The wise and learned, and they who were skilled\nin magic and in all manner of trickery, were consulted. Nobody, however, could\nexplain the matter; and so he returned broken-hearted to his house, and began\nto arrange his affairs in prospect of certain death, for he had had sufficient\nexperience of the King to know that his Majesty would not go back from his\nthreat. Amongst other things, he advised his son to travel for a time, until\nthe King\'s anger should have somewhat cooled.\n\nThe young fellow, who was both clever and handsome, started off whithersoever\nKismat might lead him. He had been gone some days, when he fell in with an old\nfarmer, who also was on a journey to a certain village. Finding the old man\nvery pleasant, he asked him if he might accompany him, professing to be on a\nvisit to the same place. The old farmer agreed, and they walked along\ntogether. The day was hot, and the way was long and weary.\n\n"Don\'t you think it would be pleasanter if you and I sometimes gave one\nanother a lift?" said the youth.\n\n"What a fool the man is!" thought the old farmer.\n\nPresently they passed through a field of corn ready for the sickle, and\nlooking like a sea of gold as it waved to and fro in the breeze.\n\n"Is this eaten or not?" said the young man.\n\nNot understanding his meaning, the old man replied, "I don\'t know."\n\nAfter a little while the two travellers arrived at a big village, where the\nyoung man gave his companion a clasp-knife, and said, "Take this, friend, and\nget two horses with it; "but, mind and bring it back, for it is very\nprecious."\n\nThe old man, looking half amused and half angry, pushed back the knife,\nmuttering something to the effect that his friend was either a fool himself or\nelse trying to play the fool with him. The young man pretended not to notice\nhis reply, and remained almost silent till they reached the city, a short\ndistance outside which Was the old farmer\'s house. They walked about the bazar\nand went to the mosque, but nobody saluted them or invited them to come in and\nrest.\n\n"What a large cemetery!" exclaimed the young man.\n\n"What does the man mean," thought \'the old farmer, "calling this largely\npopulated city a cemetery?"\n\nOn leaving the city their way led through a cemetery. where a few people were\npraying beside a grave and distributing chapatis and kulchas to passers-by, in\nthe name of their beloved dead. They beckoned to the two travellers and gave\nthem as much as they would.\n\n"What a splendid city this is!" said the young man.\n\n"Now, the man must surely be demented!" thought the old farmer. "I wonder what\nhe will do, next? He will be calling the land water, and the water land; and\nbe speaking of light where there is darkness, and of darkness when it is\nlight." However, he kept his thoughts to himself.\n\nPresently, they had to wade through a stream that ran along the edge of the\ncemetery. The water was rather deep, so the old farmer took off his shoes and\npaijamas and crossed over; but the young man waded through it with his shoes\nand paijamas on.\n\n"Well! I never did see such a perfect fool, both in word and in deed," said\nthe old man to, himself.\n\nHowever, he liked the fellow; and thinking that he would amuse his wife and\ndaughter, he invited him to come and stay at his house as long as he had\noccasion to remain in the village.\n\n"Thank you very much," the young man replied; "but let me first inquire, if\nyou please, whether the beam of your house is strong."\n\nThe old farmer left him in despair, and entered his house laughing.\n\n"There is a man in yonder field," he said, after returning their greetings.\n"He has come the greater part of the way with me, and I wanted him to put up\nhere as long as he had to stay in this village. But the fellow is such a fool\nthat I cannot make anything out of him. He wants to know if the beam of this\nhouse is all right. The man must be mad!" and saying this, he burst into a fit\nof laughter.\n\n"Father," said the farmer\'s daughter, who was a very sharp and wise girl,\n"this man, whosoever he is, is no fool, as you deem him. He only wishes to\nknow if you can afford to entertain him."\n\n"Oh! of course," replied, the farmer. "I see. Well, perhaps you can help me to\nsolve some of his other mysteries. While we were walking together he asked\nwhether he should carry me or I should carry him, as he thought that would be\na pleasanter mode of proceeding."\n\n"Most assuredly," said the girl. "He meant that one of you should tell a story\nto beguile the time."\n\n"Oh yes. Well, we were passing through a corn-field, when he asked me whether\nit was eaten or not."\n\n"And didn\'t you know the meaning of this, father? He simply wished to know if\nthe man was in debt or not; because, if the owner of the field was in debt,\nthen the produce of the field was as good as eaten to him; that is, it would\nhave to go to his creditors."\n\n"Yes, yes, yes, of course! Then, on entering a certain village, he bade me\ntake his clasp-knife and get two horses with it, and bring back the knife\nagain to him."\n\n"Are not two stout sticks as good as two horses for helping one along on the\nroad? He only asked you to cut a couple of sticks and be careful not to lose\nhis knife."\n\n"I see," said the farmer. "While we were walking over the city we did not .see\nanybody that we knew, and not a soul gave us a scrap of anything to eat, till\nwe were passing the cemetery; but there some people called to us and put into\nour hands some chapatis and kulchas; so my companion called the city a\ncemetery, and the cemetery a city."\n\nThis also is to be understood, father, if one thinks of the city as the place\nwhere everything is to be obtained, and of inhospitable people as worse than\nthe dead. The city, though crowded with people, was as if dead, as far as you\nwere concerned; while, in the cemetery, which is crowded with the dead, you\nwere saluted by kind friends and provided with bread."\n\n"True, true!" said\' the astonished farmer. "Then, just now, when we were\ncrossing the stream, he waded through it without taking off his shoes and\npaijamas."\n\n"I admire his wisdom," replied the girl. "I have often thought how stupid\npeople were to venture into that swiftly flowing stream and over those sharp\nstones with bare feet. The slightest stumble and they would fall, and be\nwetted from head to foot. This friend of yours is a most wise man. I should\nlike to see him and speak to him."\n\n"Very well," said the farmer; "I will go and find him, and bring him in."\n\n"Tell him, father, that our beams are strong enough, and then he will come in.\nI\'ll send on, ahead a present to the man, to show him that we can afford to\nhave him for our guest."\n\nAccordingly she called a servant and sent him to the young man with a present\nof a basin of ghee, twelve chapatis, and a jar of milk, and the following\nmessage:--" O friend, the moon is full; twelve months make a year, and the sea\nis overflowing with water."\n\nHalf-way the bearer of this present and message met his little son, who,\nseeing what was in the basket, begged his father to give him some of the food.\nHis father foolishly complied. Presently he saw the young man, and gave him\nthe rest of the present and the message.\n\n"Give your mistress my salaam," he replied, "and tell her that the moon is\nnew, and that I can only find eleven months in the year, and the sea is by no\nmeans full."\n\nNot understanding the meaning of these words, the servant repeated them word\nfor word, as he had heard them, to his mistress; and thus his theft was\ndiscovered, and he was severely punished. After a little while the young man\nappeared with the old farmer. Great attention was shown to him, and he was\ntreated in every way as if he were the son of a great man, although his humble\nhost knew nothing of his origin. At length be told them everything--about the\nlaughing of the fish, his father\'s threatened execution, and his own\nbanishment--and asked their advice as to what he should do.\n\n"The laughing of the fish," said the girl, "which seems to have been the cause\nof all this trouble, indicates that there is a man in the palace who is\nplotting against the King\'s life."\n\n"Joy, joy!" exclaimed the vizier\'s son. "There is yet time for me to return\nand save my father from an ignominious and unjust death, and the King from\ndanger."\n\nThe following day be hastened back to his own country, taking with him the\nfarmer\'s daughter. Immediately on arrival he ran to the palace and informed\nhis father of what he had heard. The poor vizier, now almost dead from the\nexpectation of death, was at once carried to the King, to whom be repeated the\nnews that his son had just brought.\n\n"Never!" said the King.\n\n"But it must be, so, your Majesty," replied the vizier; "and in order to prove\nthe truth of what I have heard, I pray you to call together all the maids in\nyour palace, and order them to jump over a pit, which must be dug. We\'ll soon\nfind out whether there is any man there."\n\nThe King had the pit dug, and commanded all the maids belonging to the palace\nto try to jump it. All of them tried, but only one succeeded. That one was\nfound to be a man!\n\nThus was the Queen satisfied, and the faithful old vizier saved.\n\nAfterwards, as soon as could be, the vizier\'s son married the old farmer\'s\ndaughter and a most happy marriage it was.\n\n\n\n[![](tn/69.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/69.jpg)\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Demon with the Matted Hair](ift26.htm)\n\n'
