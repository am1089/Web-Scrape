But, indeed, distinction, royal sway, departs from him who\nperforms the horse-sacrifice; and when a man attains to distinction, the lute\nis played to him. Two Brahma _n_ ical lute-players sing (and play) for a year;\nfor that--to wit, the lute--is a form (attribute) of distinction: it is\ndistinction they thus confer upon him.\n\np. 286\n\n13:1:5:22\\. Concerning this they say, 'Were both to be Brahma _n_ as who sing,\nnoble rank (or political power) would depart from him; for he--to wit, a\nBrahma _n_ a--is a form of the priestly office; and the nobility takes no\ndelight in the priestly office (or priesthood).\n\n13:1:5:33\\. 'And were both to be Ra _g_ anyas (nobles), spiritual lustre would\ndepart from him; for he--to wit, the Ra _g_ anya--is a form of noble rank, and\nspiritual lustre takes no delight in noble rank.' One of those who sing is a\nBrahma _n_ a, and the other a Ra _g_ anya; for the Brahma _n_ a means priestly\noffice, and the Ra _g_ anya noble rank: thus his distinction (social position)\ncomes to be guarded on either side by the priesthood and the nobility.\n\n13:1:5:44\\. Concerning this they say, 'Were both to sing by day, his\ndistinction would be apt to fall away from him: for that--to wit, the day--is\na form of the priestly dignity; and when the king chooses he may oppress\n(despoil) the Brahma _n_ a, but he will fare the worse (or, become the poorer)\nfor it.\n\n13:1:5:55\\. 'And if both (were to sing) at night, spiritual lustre would fall\naway from him; for that--to wit, the night--is a form of the nobility, and\nspiritual lustre takes no delight in the nobility.' The Brahma _n_ a sings by\nday 1, and the Ra _g_ anya at night 2; and thus, indeed, his distinction comes\nto be guarded on either side by the priesthood and the nobility 3.\n\n13:1:5:66\\. 'Such sacrifices he offered,--such gifts he gave!' such (are the\ntopics about which) the\n\np. 287\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahma _n_ a sings 1; for to the Brahma _n_ a belongs\nthe fulfilment of wishes [2](sbe44079.htm#fn_720): it is with the fulfilment\nof wishes he (the Brahma _n_ a) thus endows him (the Sacrificer). 'Such war he\nwaged,--such battle he won!' such (are the topics about which) the Ra _g_ anya\nsings; for the battle is the Ra _g_ anya's strength: it is with strength he\nthus endows him. Three stanzas the one sings, and three stanzas the other,\nthey amount to six,--six seasons make up a year: he thus establishes (the\nSacrificer) in the seasons, in the year. To both of them he presents a\nhundred; for man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred energies: it\nis vitality and energy, vital power, he confers upon him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[286:1](sbe44078.htm#fr_720) Viz. at the fore-offerings of the three cake-\nofferings (ish _t_ is) to Savit _ri_ ; whilst staying in the south part of the\nsacrificial ground.\n\n[286:2](sbe44078.htm#fr_721) Viz. during the performance of the Dh _ri_ tis\nafter sunset.\n\n[286:3](sbe44078.htm#fr_722) The 'iti' at the end belongs to the following\nparagraph.\n\n[287:1](sbe44078.htm#fr_723) Cf.
