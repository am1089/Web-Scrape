Should it be said that (the stories told in the Upanishads) are for the\npurpose of the Pariplava; not so, since (certain stories) are specified.\n\nWe meet in the Vedanta-texts with certain stories such as 'Pratardana the son\nof Divodasa came to the beloved abode of Indra,' &c., and similar ones. The\nquestion here arises whether the stories are merely meant to be recited at the\nA _s_ vamedha sacrifice or to convey knowledge of a special kind.--The\nPurvapakshin maintains that as the text' they tell the stories' declares the\nspecial connexion of those stories with the so-called pariplava performance,\n\np. 698\n\nthey cannot be assumed to be mainly concerned with knowledge.--This view the\nSutra negatives, on the ground that not all stories of that kind are specially\nconnected with the pariplava. The texts rather single out special stories only\nas suitable for that performance; on the general injunction quoted above there\nfollows an injunction defining _which_ stories are to be told, 'King Manu, the\nson of Vivasvat,' &c. The stories told in the Vedanta-texts do not therefore\nform parts of the pariplava performance, but are connected with injunctions of\nmeditations.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 24.
