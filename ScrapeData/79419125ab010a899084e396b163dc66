But it is seen.\n\nThe word 'but' discards the purvapaksha.\n\nYour assertion that this world cannot have originated from Brahman on account\nof the difference of its character is not founded on an absolutely true tenet.\nFor we see that from man, who is acknowledged to be intelligent, non-\nintelligent things such as hair and nails originate, and that, on the other\nhand, from avowedly non-intelligent matter, such as cow-dung, scorpions and\nsimilar animals are produced.--But--to state an objection--the real cause of\nthe non-intelligent hair and nails is the human body which is itself non-\nintelligent, and the non-intelligent bodies only of scorpions are the effects\nof non-intelligent dung.--Even thus, we reply, there remains a difference in\ncharacter (between the cause, for instance, the dung, and the effect, for\ninstance, the body of the scorpion), in so far as some non-intelligent matter\n(the body) is the abode of an intelligent principle (the scorpion's soul),\nwhile other non-intelligent matter (the dung) is not. Moreover, the difference\nof nature--due to the cause passing over into the effect--between the bodies\nof men on the one side and hair and nails on the other side, is, on account of\nthe divergence of colour, form, &c., very considerable after all. The same\nremark holds good with regard to cow-dung and the bodies of scorpions, &c. If\nabsolute equality were insisted on (in the case of one thing being the effect\nof another), the relation of material cause and effect (which after all\nrequires a distinction of the two) would be annihilated. If, again, it be\nremarked that in the case of men and hair as well as in that of scorpions and\n\np. 306\n\ncow-dung there is one characteristic feature, at least, which is found in the\neffect as well as in the cause, viz. the quality of being of an earthy nature;\nwe reply that in the case of Brahman and the world also one characteristic\nfeature, viz. that of existence (satta), is found in ether, &c. (which are the\neffects) as well as in Brahman (which is the cause).--He, moreover, who on the\nground of the difference of the attributes tries to invalidate the doctrine of\nBrahman being the cause of the world, must assert that he understands by\ndifference of attributes either the non-occurrence (in the world) of the\nentire complex of the characteristics of Brahman, or the non-occurrence of any\n(some or other) characteristic, or the non-occurrence of the characteristic of\nintelligence. The first assertion would lead to the negation of the relation\nof cause and effect in general, which relation is based on the fact of there\nbeing in the effect something over and above the cause (for if the two were\nabsolutely identical they could not be distinguished). The second assertion is\nopen to the charge of running counter to what is well known; for, as we have\nalready remarked, the characteristic quality of existence which belongs to\nBrahman is found likewise in ether and so on. For the third assertion the\nrequisite proving instances are wanting; for what instances could be brought\nforward against the upholder of Brahman, in order to prove the general\nassertion that whatever is devoid of intelligence is seen not to be an effect\nof Brahman? (The upholder of Brahman would simply not admit any such\ninstances) because he maintains that this entire complex of things has Brahman\nfor its material cause. And that all such assertions are contrary to\nScripture, is clear, as we have already shown it to be the purport of\nScripture that Brahman is the cause and substance of the world. It has indeed\nbeen maintained by the purvapakshin that the other means of proof also (and\nnot merely sacred tradition) apply to Brahman, on account of its being an\naccomplished entity (not something to be accomplished as religious duties\nare); but such an assertion is entirely gratuitous. For Brahman, as being\ndevoid of form and so on, cannot become an object of\n\np. 307\n\nperception; and as there are in its case no characteristic marks (on which\nconclusions, &c. might be based), inference also and the other means of proof\ndo not apply to it; but, like religious duty, it is to be known solely on the\nground of holy tradition. Thus Scripture also declares, 'That doctrine is not\nto be obtained by argument, but when it is declared by another then, O\ndearest! it is easy to understand' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 9). And again, 'Who in truth\nknows it? Who could here proclaim it, whence this creation sprang?' ( _Ri_\ng-v. Sa _m_ h. X, 129, 6). These two mantras show that the cause of this world\nis not to be known even by divine beings (i _s_ vara) 1 of extraordinary power\nand wisdom.\n\nThere are also the following Sm _ri_ ti passages to the same effect: 'Do not\napply reasoning to those things which are uncognisable 2;' 'Unevolved he is\ncalled, uncognisable, unchangeable;' 'Not the legions of the gods know my\norigin, not the great _ri_ shis. For I myself am in every way the origin of\nthe gods and great _ri_ shis' (Bha. Gi. X, 2).--And if it has been maintained\nabove that the scriptural passage enjoining thought (on Brahman) in addition\nto mere hearing (of the sacred texts treating of Brahman) shows that reasoning\nalso is to be allowed its place, we reply that the passage must not\ndeceitfully be taken as enjoining bare independent ratiocination, but must be\nunderstood to represent reasoning as a subordinate auxiliary of intuitional\nknowledge. By reasoning of the latter type we may, for instance, arrive at the\nfollowing conclusions; that because the state of dream and the waking state\nexclude each other the Self is not connected with those states; that, as the\nsoul in the state of deep sleep leaves the phenomenal world behind and becomes\none with that whose Self is pure Being, it has for its Self pure Being apart\nfrom the phenomenal world; that as the world springs from Brahman it cannot be\nseparate from Brahman,\n\np. 308\n\naccording to the principle of the non-difference of cause and effect, &c. 1\nThe fallaciousness of mere reasoning will moreover be demonstrated later on\n(II, 1, 11).--He 2, moreover, who merely on the ground of the sacred tradition\nabout an intelligent cause of the world would assume this entire world to be\nof an intellectual nature would find room for the other scriptural passage\nquoted above ('He became knowledge and what is devoid of knowledge') which\nteaches a distinction of intellect and non-intellect; for he could avail\nhimself of the doctrine of intellect being sometimes manifested and sometimes\nnon-manifested. His antagonist, on the other hand (i. e. the Sa _n_ khya),\nwould not be able to make anything of the passage, for it distinctly teaches\nthat the highest cause constitutes the Self of the entire world.\n\nIf, then, on account of difference of character that which is intelligent\ncannot pass over into what is non-intelligent, that also which is non-\nintelligent (i.e. in our case, the non-intelligent pradhana of the Sa _n_\nkhyas) cannot pass over into what is intelligent.--(So much for argument's\nsake,) but apart from that, as the argument resting on difference of character\nhas already been refuted, we must assume an intelligent cause of the world in\nagreement with Scripture.\n\np. 309\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[307:1](sbe34145.htm#fr_272) On i _s_ vara in the above meaning, compare\nDeussen, p. 69, note 41.\n\n[307:2](sbe34145.htm#fr_273) The line 'prak _ri_ tibhya _h_ param,' &c. is\nwanting in all MSS.
