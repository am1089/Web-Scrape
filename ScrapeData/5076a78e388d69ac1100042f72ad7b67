If it be said 'on account of connexion'; it may be so, on account of\nascertainment.\n\nBut as in the preceding sections the term Self is seen to be connected with\nwhat is not of the nature of the Self, such as the Self of breath, and so on,\nit is not possible to draw a valid conclusion from the subsequent passage!--It\n_is_ possible, the Sutra replies, 'on account of ascertainment.' For the\nprevious clause, 'from that Self there originated the Ether,' settles in the\nmind the idea of the highest Self, and that idea then is transferred in\nsuccession to the (so-called) Self of breath, the Self of mind, and so on,\nuntil it finally finds rest in the Self of bliss, beyond which there is no\nother Self; while at the same time the subsequent clause 'he desired' confirms\nthe idea of the highest Self. The term Self thus connects itself from the\nbeginning with things which are not true Selfs, because the highest Self is as\nit were viewed in them.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'bliss and the\nrest.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 18.
