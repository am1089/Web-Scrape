And the goblin on his shoulder saw that he was\nsilent and said: "O King, why are you so obstinate? Go home. Spend the night\nin rest. You ought not to take me to that rascally monk. But if you insist,\nthen I will tell you another story. Listen."\n\n\n\nThere is a city called Brilliant-peak. There lived a glorious king named Moon,\nwho delighted the eyes of his subjects. Wise men said that he was brave,\ngenerous, and the very home of beauty. But in spite of all his wealth, he was\nvery sad at heart. For he found no wife worthy of him.\n\nOne day this king went with soldiers on horseback into a great wood, to hunt\nthere and forget his sorrow. There he split open many boars with his arrows as\nthe sun splits the black darkness, and made fierce lions into cushions for his\narrows, and slew mountainous monsters with his terrible darts.\n\nAs he hunted, he spurred his horse and beat him terribly. And the horse was so\nhurt by the spur and the whip that he could not tell rough from smooth. He\ndashed off quicker than the wind, and in a moment carried the king into\nanother forest a hundred miles away.\n\nThere the king lost his way, and as he wandered about wearily, he saw a great\nlake. He stopped there, unsaddled his horse, let him bathe and drink, and\nfound him some grass in the shade of the trees. Then he bathed and drank\nhimself, and when he had rested, he looked all about him.\n\nAnd he saw a hermit\'s daughter of marvellous beauty under an ashoka tree with\nanother girl. She had no ornaments but flowers. She was charming even in a\ndress of bark. She was particularly attractive because of her thick masses of\nhair arranged in a girlish way.\n\nAnd the king fell in love with her and thought: "Who is she? Is she a goddess\ncome to bathe in these waters? Or Gauri, separated from her husband Shiva,\nleading a hard life to win him again? Or the lovely moon, taking a human form,\nand trying to be attractive in the daytime? I will go to her and find out."\n\nSo he drew near to her. And when she saw him coming, she was astonished at his\nbeauty and dropped her hands, which had been weaving a garland of flowers. And\nshe thought: "Who can he be in this forest? Some fairy perhaps. Blessed are my\neyes this day."\n\nSo she rose, modestly looking another way, and started to go away, though her\nlimbs failed her. Then the king approached and said: "Beautiful maiden, I have\ncome a long distance, and you never saw me before. I ask only to look at you,\nand you should welcome me. Is this hermit manners, to run away?"\n\nThen her clever friend made the king sit down and treated him as an honoured\nguest. And the king respectfully asked her: "My good girl, what happy family\ndoes your friend adorn? What are the syllables of her name, which must be a\ndelight to the ear? Or why at her age does she torture a body as delicate as a\nflower with a hermit\'s life in a lonely wood?"\n\nAnd the friend answered: "Your Majesty, she is the daughter of the hermit\nKanva and the heavenly nymph Menaka. She grew up here in the hermitage, and\nher name is Lotus-bloom. With her father\'s permission she came here to the\nlake to bathe. And her father\'s hermitage is not far from here."\n\nThen the king was delighted. He mounted his horse and rode to the hermitage of\nholy Kanva, to ask for the girl. And he entered the hermitage in modest garb,\nleaving his horse outside. Then he was surrounded by hermits with hoary crowns\nand bark garments like the trees, and saw the sage Kanva radiant and cool like\nthe moon. And he drew near and fell at his feet.\n\nAnd the wise hermit greeted him and let him rest, then said: "My son Moon, I\nwill tell you something to your advantage. Listen. I know what fear of death\nthere is in mortal creatures. Why then do you uselessly kill the wild beasts?\nWarriors were made by the Creator to protect the timid. Therefore protect your\nsubjects in righteousness, and root out evil. As Happiness flees before you,\nstrive to overtake her with all your means, elephants and horses and things.\nEnjoy your kingship. Be generous. Become glorious. Abandon this vice of\nhunting, this sport of Death. For slayer and slain are equally deceived. Why\nspend your time in such an evil pursuit?"\n\nThe sensible king was pleased and said: "Holy sir, I am instructed. And great\nis my gratitude for this instruction. From now on I hunt no more. Let the wild\nanimals live without fear."\n\nThen the hermit said: "I am pleased with your protection of the animals.\nChoose any boon you will."\n\nThen the quick-witted king said: "Holy sir, if you are kindly disposed, give\nme your daughter Lotus-bloom."\n\nSo the hermit gave him his daughter, the child of the nymph, who then came up\nafter her bath. So they were married, and the king wore cheerful garments, and\nLotus-bloom was adorned by the hermits\' wives. And the weeping hermits\naccompanied them in procession to the edge of the hermitage. Then the king\ntook his wife Lotus-bloom, mounted his horse, and started for his city.\n\nAt last the sun, seeing the king tired with his long journeying, sank wearily\nbehind the western mountain. And fawn-eyed night appeared, clad in the garment\nof darkness, like a woman going to meet her lover. And the king saw an\nashvattha tree on the shore of a pond in a spot covered with grass and twigs,\nand he decided to spend the night there.\n\nSo he dismounted, fed and watered his horse, brought water from the pond, and\nrested with his beloved. And they passed the night there.\n\nIn the morning he arose, performed his devotions, and prepared to set out with\nhis wife to rejoin his soldiers. Then, like a cloud black as soot with tawny\nlightning-hair, there appeared a great giant. He wore a chaplet of human\nentrails, a cord of human hair, he was chewing the head of a man, and drinking\nblood from a skull.\n\nThe giant laughed aloud, spit fire in his wrath, and showed his dreadful\nfangs. And he scolded the king and said: "Scoundrel! I am a giant named Flame-\nface. This tree is my home; even the gods do not dare to trespass here. But\nyou and your wife have trespassed and enjoyed yourselves. Now swallow your own\nimpudence, you rascal! You are lovesick, so I will split open your heart and\neat it, and I will drink your blood."\n\nThe king was frightened when he saw that the giant was invincible, and his\nwife was trembling, so he said respectfully: "I trespassed ignorantly. Forgive\nme. I am your guest, seeking protection in your hermitage. And I will give you\na human sacrifice, so that you will be satisfied. Be merciful then and forget\nyour anger."\n\nThen the giant forgot his anger, and thought: "Very well. Why not?" And he\nsaid: "O King, I want a noble, intelligent Brahman boy seven years old, who\nshall give himself up of his own accord for your sake. And when he is killed,\nhis mother must hold his hands tightly to the ground, and his father must hold\nhis feet, and you must cut off his head with your own sword. If you do this\nwithin seven days, then I will forgive the insult you have offered me. If not,\nI will kill you and all your people."\n\nAnd the king was so frightened that he consented. Then the giant  disappeared.\n\nThen King Moon mounted his horse with his wife Lotus-bloom and rode away sad\nat heart, seeking for his soldiers. And he thought: "Alas! I was bewildered by\nhunting and by love, and I find myself ruined. Where can I find such a\nsacrifice for the giant? Well, I will go to my own city now, and see what\nhappens."\n\nSo he continued his search, and found his soldiers and his city Brilliant-\npeak. There his subjects were delighted because he had found a wife worthy of\nhim, and they made a great feast. But it was a day of despondency and dreadful\nagony for the king.\n\nOn the next day he told his counsellors the whole story. And one counsellor\nnamed Wise said: "Your Majesty, do not despair. I will find a victim for the\nsacrifice. The world is a strange place."\n\nThus the counsellor comforted the king, and made a statue of a boy out of\ngold. And he sent the statue about the land, with constant beating of drums\nand this proclamation: "We want a noble Brahman boy seven years old who will\noffer himself as a sacrifice to a giant with the permission of his parents.\nAnd when he is killed, his mother must hold his hands, and his father must\nhold his feet. And as a reward, the king will give his parents a hundred\nvillages and this statue of gold and gems."\n\nNow there was a Brahman boy on a farm, who was only seven years old, but\nwonderfully brave. He was of great beauty, and even in childhood he was always\nthinking about others. He said to the heralds: "Gentlemen, I will give you my\nbody. Wait a moment. I will hurry back after telling my parents."\n\nSo they told the boy to go. And he went into the house, bowed before his\nparents, and said: "Mother! Father! I am going to give this wretched body of\nmine in order to win lasting happiness. Pray permit me. And I will take the\nking\'s gift, this statue of myself made of gold and gems, and give it to you\ntogether with the hundred villages. Thus I will pay my debt to you, and do\nsome real good. And you will never be poor again, and will have plenty more\nsons."\n\nBut his parents immediately said: "Son, what are you saying? Have you the\nrheumatism? Or are you possessed by a devil? If not, why do you talk nonsense?\nWho would sacrifice his child for money? And what child would give his body?"\n\nBut the boy said: "I am not mad. Listen. My words are full of sense. The body\nis the seat of unnameable impurities, it is loathsome and full of pain. It\nperishes in no long time at best. If some good can be done with the worthless\nthing, that is a great advantage in this weary life, so wise men say. And what\ngood is there except helping others? If anyone can serve his parents so\neasily, then how lightly should the body be esteemed!"\n\nThus the boy, with his bold words and his firm purpose, persuaded his grieving\nparents. And he went and got from the king\'s men the golden statue and the\nhundred villages, and gave them to his parents.\n\nSo the boy with his parents followed the king\'s men to the city Brilliant-\npeak. And the king looked upon the brave boy as a magic jewel for his own\npreservation, and rejoiced greatly. He adorned the boy with garlands and\nperfumes, put him on an elephant, and took him with his parents to the home of\nthe giant.\n\nThere the priest traced a magic circle beside the tree, and reverently lit the\nholy fire. Then the horrible giant Flame-face appeared, mumbling words of his\nown. He staggered, for he was drunk with blood, and snorted and yawned. His\neyes flashed fire and his shadow made the whole world dark.\n\nAnd the king said respectfully: "Great being, here is the human sacrifice you\nasked for, and this is the seventh day since I promised it. Be merciful.\nAccept this sacrifice."\n\nAnd the giant licked his chops, and looked the boy over, who was to be the\nsacrifice. Then the noble boy thought: "I have done some good with this body\nof mine. May I never rest in heaven or in eternal salvation, but may I have\nmany lives in which to do some good with my body." And the air was filled with\nthe chariots of gods who rained down flowers.\n\nThen the boy was laid before the giant. His mother held his hands, and his\nfather held his feet. When the king drew his sword and was ready to strike,\nthe boy laughed so heartily that all of them, even the giant, forgot what they\nwere doing, looked at the boy\'s face, and bowed low before him.\n\nWhen the goblin had told this strange story, he asked the king: "O King, why\ndid the boy laugh at the moment of death? I have a great curiosity about this\npoint. If you know and will not tell, then your head will fly into a hundred\npieces."\n\nAnd the king said: "Listen. I will tell you why the boy laughed. When danger\ncomes to any weak creature, he cries for life to his mother and father. If\nthey are not there, he begs protection from the king, whom heaven made his\nprotector. Failing the king, he cries to a god. Some one of these should be\nhis protector. But in the case of this boy everything was contrary. His\nparents held his hands and feet because they wanted money. And the king was\nready to kill him with his own hand, to save his own life. And the giant, who\nis a kind of a god, had come there especially to eat him.  So the boy thought:\nThey are ridiculously fooled about their bodies, which are fragile, worthless,\nthe seat of pain and suffering. The bodies of the greatest gods perish. And\nsuch creatures as these imagine that their bodies will endure!\' So when he saw\ntheir strange madness, and felt that his own wishes were fulfilled, the\nBrahman boy laughed in astonishment and delight."\n\nThen the goblin slipped from the king\'s shoulder and went back to his home.\nAnd the king followed with determination. The heart of a good man is like the\nheart of the ocean. It cannot be shaken.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Nineteenth Goblin: The Man, his Wife, and her Lover, who all died for\nLove.
