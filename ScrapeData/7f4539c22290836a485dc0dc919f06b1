His messenger spake, saying: "You have vowed to wage war\nagainst us. The time has come for you to fulfil your vow. Your kingdom was\nseized by me, your wife Draupadi was put to shame, and you were all made\nexiles. Why do you not now seek to be avenged in battle? Where is drowsy\nBhima, who boasted that he would drink the blood of Duhsasana? Duhsasana is\nweary with waiting for him. Where is arrogant Arjuna, who hath Drona to meet?\nWhen mountains are blown about like dust, and men hold back the wind with\ntheir hands, Arjuna will take captive the mighty Drona. . . . Of what account\nwas the mace of Bhima and the bow of Arjuna on the day when your kingdom was\ntaken from you, and you were banished like vagabonds? . . .\n\np. 286\n\n[paragraph continues] Vain will be the help of Krishna when you meet us in\nbattle."\n\nKrishna answered the messenger, saying: "Vainly dost thou boast of prowess,\nbut ere long thy fate will be made known unto thee. I will consume thine army\nlike to fire which consumeth withered grass. Thou wilt not escape me, for I\nwill drive the chariot of Arjuna. And let Duhsasana know that the vow of Bhima\nwill ere long be fulfilled."\n\nSaid Arjuna: "Tell thou Duryodhana, \'It is unseemly for warriors to boast like\nwomen. . . . It is well that Duhsasana cometh to battle.\'"\n\nWhen the messenger spake these words to Duryodhana, Karna said: "Cease this\nchatter! Let the drums of war be sounded."\n\nSo on the morrow at red dawn the armies of the Kauravas and the Pandavas were\nassembled for battle on the wide plain of Kuru-Kshetra. Bhishma, with his\nlarge palmyra standard decked with five stars, had been chosen to lead\nDuryodhana\'s army, and Karna, who had quarrelled with him, vowed not to fight\nso long as the older warrior remained alive. "Should he fall, however," Karna\nsaid, "I will go forth against Arjuna."\n\nThe army of the Pandavas was commanded by Dhrishta-dyumna, son of Drupada, and\nbrother of Draupadi. Among the young heroes were Arjuna\'s two sons, the noble\nand peerless Abhimanyu, whose mother was Krishna\'s fair sister Subhadra, and\nbrave Iravat, whose mother was Ulupi, the serpent nymph, daughter of the king\nof the Nagas. Bhima\'s Rakshasa son, the terrible Ghatotkacha, who had power to\nchange his shape and create illusions, had also hastened to assist his\nkinsmen. Krishna drove the chariot of Arjuna, who carried his celestial bow,\nnamed Gandiva, the gift of the god Agni;\n\np. 287\n\nand his standard was the image of Hanuman, the chief ape god, who was the son\nof Vayu, the wind god. Now the army of Duryodhana was more numerous than the\narmy of Yudhishthira.\n\nDrona led the right wing of the Kaurava forces, which was strengthened by\nShakuni, the gambler, and his Gandhari lancers. The left wing was led by\nDuhsasana, who was followed by Kamboja cavalry and fierce Sakas and Yavanas\nmounted on rapid steeds. The peoples of the north were there and the peoples\nof the south, and of the east also. 1 Blind old Dhritarashtra was in the rear,\nand with him was Sanjaya, his charioteer, who related all that took place,\nhaving been gifted with divine vision by Vyasa.\n\nEre yet the conflict began, Yudhishthira walked unarmed towards the Kauravas,\nwhereat his kinsmen made merry, thinking he was terror-stricken. But Pandu\'s\nnoble son first spake to Bhishma and asked permission to fight against him.\nBhishma gave consent. Then he addressed Drona in like terms, and Drona gave\nconsent also. And ere he returned to his place, Yudhishthira called out before\nthe Kaurava army: "Whoso desireth to help our cause, let him follow me." When\nhe had spoken thus, Yuyutsu, the half-brother of Duryodhana, made answer: "If\nthou wilt elevate me, I will serve thee well." Said Yudhishthira: "Be my\nbrother." Then Yuyutsu followed Yudhishthira with all his men, and no man\nendeavoured to hold him back.\n\nWhen the armies were being set in order for battle, Arjuna bade Krishna to\ndrive his chariot to the open space on which the struggle would take place.\nIndra\'s\n\np. 288\n\nmighty son surveyed the hosts, and when he saw his kinsmen, young and old, and\nhis friends and all the elders and princes on either side ready to Ell upon\none another, his heart was touched, and he trembled with pity and sorrow. He\nspake to Krishna, saying: "I seek nor victory, nor kingdom, nor any joy upon\nearth. Those for whose sake we might wish for power are gathered against us in\nbattle. What joy can come to us if we commit the crime of slaying our own\nkinsmen?"\n\nSo saying, Arjuna let fall his celestial bow and sat down on the bench of his\nchariot with a heart full of grief.\n\nKrishna admonished Arjuna, saying: "Thou art a Kshatriya, and it is thy duty\nto fight, no matter what may befall thee or befall others. So I command thee\nwho am responsible for thy doings. He who hath wisdom sorroweth not for the\nliving or for the dead. As one casteth off old raiment and putteth on new, so\nthe soul casteth off this body and entereth the new body. Naught existeth that\nis not of the soul."\n\nAfter long instruction, Krishna revealed himself to Arjuna in his celestial\nsplendour and power and said: "Let thy heart and thine understanding be fixed\nin me, and thou shalt dwell in me hereafter. I will deliver thee from all thy\nsins. . . . I am the same unto all creatures; there is none hateful to me--\nnone dear. Those who worship me are in me and I am in them. Those who hate me\nare consigned to evil births: they are deluded birth after birth, nor ever\nreach unto me." 1\n\nArjuna gave ear unto the counsel of Krishna, and prepared for the fray.\n\np. 289\n\nLoudly bellowed the war shells, and the drums of battle were sounded. The\nKauravas made ready to attack with horsemen, footmen, and charioteers, and\nelephants of war. The Pandavas were marshalled to meet them. And the air was\nfilled with the shouting of men, the roaring of elephants, the blasts of\ntrumpets, and the beating of drums: the rattling of chariots was like to\nthunder rolling in heaven. The gods and Gandharvas assembled in the clouds and\nsaw the hosts which had gathered for mutual slaughter.\n\nAs both armies waited for sunrise, a tempest arose and the dawn was darkened\nby dust clouds, so that men could scarce behold one another. Evil were the\nomens. Blood dropped like rain out of heaven, while jackals howled\nimpatiently, and kites and vultures screamed hungrily for human flesh. The\nearth shook, peals of thunder were heard, although there were no clouds, and\nangry lightning rent the horrid gloom; flaming thunderbolts struck the rising\nsun and broke in fragments with loud noise. . . .\n\nThe undaunted warriors never faltered, despite these signs and warnings.\nShouting defiance, they mingled in conflict, eager for victory, and strongly\narmed. Swords were wielded and ponderous maces, javelins were hurled, and\nnumerous darts also; countless arrows whistled in speedy flight.\n\nWhen the wind fell and the air cleared, the battle waxed in fury. Bhishma\nachieved mighty deeds. Duryodhana led his men against Bhima\'s, and they fought\nwith valour. Yudhishthira fought with Salya, Rajah of Madra 1; Dhrishta-\ndyumna, son of Drupada, went against Drona, who had captured aforetime half of\nthe Panchala kingdom\n\np. 290\n\nwith the aid of the Pandavas. Drupada was opposed to Jayadratha, the Rajah of\nSindhu, who had endeavoured to carry off Draupadi, and was compelled to\nacknowledge himself the slave of Yudhishthira. Many single combats were fought\nwith uncertain result.\n\nAll day the armies battled with growing ardour. When evening was coming on,\nAbhimanyu, son of Arjuna, perceived that the advantage lay with the Kauravas,\nchiefly because of Bhishma\'s prowess. So he went speedily against that mighty\nwarrior, and cut down the ensign of his chariot. Bhishma said that never\nbefore had he beheld a youthful hero who could perform greater deeds. Then he\nadvanced to make fierce attack upon the Pandava army. Victoriously he went,\ncutting a blood-red path through the stricken legions; none could resist him\nfor a time. The heart of Arjuna was filled with shame, and he rode against\nBhishma, whose advance was stayed. The two heroes fought desperately until\ndusk. Then Bhishma retired; but Arjuna followed him, and pressed into the\nheart of the Kaurava host, achieving great slaughter. The truce was sounded,\nand the first day\'s battle came to an end.\n\nYudhishthira was despondent because that the fortunes of war seemed to be\nagainst him; in the darkness he went unto Krishna, who bade him to be of good\ncheer, and Yudhishthira was comforted.\n\nOn the morning of the second day Bhishma again attacked the Pandava forces,\nshattering their ranks; but Arjuna drove him back. Perceiving this, Duryodhana\nlamented to Bhishma that he had quarrelled with Karna. The old warrior made\nanswer: "Alas! I am a Kshatriya, and must fight even against my beloved\nkinsman." Then he rode against Arjuna once more, and the two warriors\ncontended fiercely and wounded one another.\n\np. 291\n\nDrupada\'s son waged a long combat with Drona, and Bhima performed mighty\ndeeds. He leapt on the back of an elephant and slew the son of the Rajah of\nMaghadha 1; and he slew the rajah and his elephant also with a single blow of\nhis mace.\n\nTowards evening a furious combat was waged by Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna, and\nLakshmana, son of Duryodhana. The young Pandava was about to achieve the\nvictory, when Duryodhana came to his son\'s aid with many rajahs. Shouts were\nraised: "Abhimanyu is in peril; he will be overcome by force of numbers!"\nArjuna heard these words, and rode to the rescue. Thereupon the Kauravas cried\nout in terror: "Arjuna! Arjuna!" and scattered in flight. That evening Bhishma\nspake unto Drona and said: "Methinks the gods are against us."\n\nOn the third day the army of the Pandavas advanced in crescent formation and\ndrove back the Kaurava army. Many were slain, and rivers of blood laid down\nthe dust; horses writhed in agony, and the air was filled with the shrieking\nand moaning of wounded men. Terrible were the omens, for headless men rose up\nand fought against one another; then the people feared that all who contended\nin that dread battle would be slain.\n\nWhen he beheld the broken cars, the fallen standards, and the heaps of slain\nelephants and horses and men, Duryodhana said to Bhishma: "Thou shouldst yield\nthy place to Karna. Methinks thou art partial to Arjuna and the Pandavas."\n\nSaid Bhishma: "Thy struggle is in vain, foolish Duryodhana. None can wipe out\nthe stain of thy sins; of no avail is cunning against a righteous cause.\nVerily, thou shalt perish because of thy folly. . . . I have no\n\np. 292\n\nfear of battle, and I will lead the Kauravas until I triumph or fall."\n\nThen angry Bhishma urged his charioteer to attack the enemy; and he drove back\nall who opposed him, even Arjuna. The fighting became general, nor did it end\nuntil night obscured the plain.\n\nBhima was the hero of the fourth day of battle. He swept against the Kauravas\nlike a whirlwind; in vain were darts thrown and arrows shot at the strong\nPandava. He wounded both Duryodhana and Salya, Rajah of Sindhu. Then fourteen\nof Duryodhana\'s brethren rushed to combat with him. Like the lion who licks\nhis lips when he beholds his prey drawing nigh, Bhima awaited them. Brief and\nterrible was the conflict, and ere six princes fled in terror, eight were\nslaughtered by the mighty Pandava.\n\nAnother day dawned, and Arjuna and Bhima advanced in triumph until they were\nmet and held back by Drona. Once again the sons of Duryodhana and Arjuna\nsought out one another. Mighty were their blows and swift, and for a time all\nmen watched them, wondering greatly. At length Lakshmana was grievously\nwounded, and was carried from the field by his kinsmen. Abhimanyu returned in\ntriumph to Yudhishthira. On that same day were slain by Bhuri-sravas the ten\ngreat sons of Satyaki, Krishna\'s kinsman.\n\nAnother day dawned, and it was a day of peril for Bhima. Confident of victory,\nhe pressed too far into the midst of the Kaurava host, and was surrounded by\noverwhelming numbers. Drupada perceived his peril and hastened to help him,\nbut neither could retreat. Then Arjuna\'s fearless son, the slayer of\nLakshmana, with twelve brave chieftains shattered the Kaurava hosts and\nrescued Bhima and Drupada from the surging warriors who thirsted for their\nblood.\n\np. 293\n\nThe seventh day was the day of Bhishma. None could withstand him in his battle\nfury. The Pandavas quailed before him, nor could Bhima or Arjuna drive him\nback. Ere night fell, the standard of Yudhishthira was cut down, and the\nKauravas rejoiced greatly, believing that they would achieve a great victory.\n\nOn the day that followed, however, the tide of battle turned. As Bhishma\nadvanced, his charioteer was slain, and the steeds took flight in terror. Then\nconfusion fell on the Kaurava army. For a time the Pandavas made resistless\nadvance amidst mighty slaughter. Then the six Gandhari princes advanced to\nbeat back the forces of Yudhishthira. On milk-white steeds they rode, and they\nswept like to sea birds across the ocean billows. They had vowed to slay\nIravat, son of Arjuna and the Naga princess. The gallant youth feared them not\nand fought triumphantly, stirred with the joy of battle; he slew five of the\nprinces, but the sixth, the eldest prince, struck down Arjuna\'s son, who was\nplucked thus rudely from life like to a fair and tender lotus. Terrible was\nthe grief of Arjuna when he was told that his son had fallen. Then with tear-\ndimmed eyes he dashed upon the foe, thirsting for vengeance; he broke through\nthe Kaurava ranks, and Bhima, who followed him, slew more of Duryodhana\'s\nbrethren.\n\nBhima\'s terrible son, the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, also sought to be avenged when\nIravat fell. Roaring like the sea, he assumed an awesome shape, and advanced\nwith flaming spears like the Destroyer at the end of Time, followed by other\nRakshasas. Warriors fled from his path, until Duryodhana went against him with\nmany elephants; but Ghatotkacha scattered the elephant host. Duryodhana fought\nlike a lion and slew four Rakshasas, whereupon Bhima\'s son, raging furiously,\nhis eyes red as fire,\n\np. 294\n\ndashed against Duryodhana; but that mighty Kaurava shot arrows like angry\nsnakes, and he wounded his enemy. Then a rajah urged his elephant in front of\nDuryodhana\'s chariot for protection. Ghatotkacha slew the great animal with a\nflaming dart. Next Bhishma pressed forward with a division to shield\nDhritarashtra\'s son, and the Rakshasa fought fiercely; he wounded Kripa, and\nwith an arrow severed the string of Bhishma\'s bow. Then the Panchalas hastened\nto aid Bhima\'s son, and the Kauravas were scattered in flight.\n\nDuryodhana was stricken with sorrow, and went to the snow-white tent of\nBhishma that night and spoke, saying: "Forgive my harsh words, O mighty\nchieftain. The Pandavas are brave in battle, but they are unable to resist\nthee. If, however, thou dost love them too well to overcome them utterly, let\nKarna take thy place, so that he may lead the hosts against our enemies."\n\nSaid Bhishma: "Alas! Duryodhana, thy struggle is of no avail. The just cause\nmust win; they who fight for the right are doubly armed. Besides, Krishna is\nwith the Pandavas: he drives Arjuna\'s car, and not even the gods could strike\nthem down. Thou art confronted by utter ruin, O proud and foolish prince. I\nwill fight as I have fought until the end, which is not now far off."\n\nOn the next day Bhishma was like a lordly elephant which treads down the marsh\nreeds; he was like a fire which burns up a dry and withering forest. In his\nchariot he advanced triumphantly, and great was the carnage which he wrought.\n\nYudhishthira was in despair, and spake to Krishna when night fell. Krishna\nsaid: "Bhishma has vowed that he will not slay one who had been born a woman,\nknowing that the righteous would defame him if he slew\n\np. 295\n\na female. Let Sikhandin 1 be therefore sent against him with Arjuna."\n\nArjuna said: "Alas! I cannot fight behind another, or achieve the fall of\nBhishma by foul means. I loved him as a child; I sat upon his knee and called\nhim \'Father\'. Rather would I perish than slay the saintly hero."\n\nSaid Krishna: "It is fated that Bhishma will fall on the morrow, a victim of\nwrong. As he hath fought against those whom he loveth, so must thou, Arjuna,\nfight against him. He hath shown thee how Kshatriyas must ever wage war,\nalthough their foemen be hated or well beloved."\n\nArjuna, being thus admonished, went forth on the tenth day with Sikhandin,\nborn a woman and made a male by a Yaksha.\n\nOnce again Duryodhana sought to prevail upon Bhishma to give place to Karna,\nand Bhishma answered him in anger: "This day will I overcome the Pandavas or\nperish on the field of battle."\n\nThen the ancient hero advanced and challenged Arjuna. A terrible conflict\nensued, and it lasted for many hours; all the warriors on either side stopped\nfighting and looked on. At length Sikhandin rushed forward like a foaming\nbillow, and when Bhishma saw him his arms fell, for he could not contend\nagainst one who had been born a woman. Then the arrows of Arjuna pierced\nBhishma\'s body, and the peerless old hero fell from his chariot wounded unto\ndeath. . . . The sun went down, and darkness swept over the plain.\n\nThere was great sorrow on the blood-drenched plain\n\np. 296\n\nthat night. Arjuna wept as a son weeps for a father, and he carried water to\nBhishma. Yudhishthira cursed the day on which the war began. To the dying\nchieftain came Duryodhana and his brethren also. Friends and enemies lamented\ntogether over the fallen hero.\n\nBhishma spake to Duryodhana, saying: "Hear the counsel of thy dying kinsman;\nhis voice speaketh as from the dead. If thy heart of stone can be moved, thou\nwilt bring this slaughter of kinsmen by kinsmen to an end now. Restore unto\nYudhishthira his kingdom and make thy peace with him, and let Pandavas and\nKauravas be friends and comrades together."\n\nHe spoke in vain, for his words stirred the heart of Duryodhana to hate his\nkinsmen the Pandavas with a deeper hatred than before.\n\nKarna came to the battlefield, and Bhishma said unto him: "Proud rivals have\nwe two been, jealous one of the other, and ever at strife. My voice faileth,\nyet must I tell thee that Arjuna is not greater than thou art on the\nbattlefield. Nor is he of higher birth, for thou art the son of Pritha and the\nsun god Surya. As Arjuna is thine own brother, \'twould be well for thee to\nbring this strife to an end."\n\nBut Bhishma spoke in vain. Karna hated his brother, and thirsted for his life.\n\nA guard was set round Bhishma, who lay supported by a pillow of arrows,\nwaiting the hour of his doom. Nor did he die until after the great conflict\nwas ended.\n\nThe Kauravas held a council of war, and they chose Drona to be their leader.\nThe battle standard of the Brahman was a water jar and a golden altar upon a\ndeer-skin. He vowed before Duryodhana that he would take Yudhishthira\nprisoner.\n\nOn the first day of Drona\'s command, and the eleventh\n\np. 297\n\nday of the great war, Abhimanyu was foremost in the fight. He dragged a\nchieftain by the hair out of his chariot, and would have taken him prisoner,\nbut Jayadratha, the rajah who had endeavoured to abduct Draupadi, intervened,\nand broke his sword upon the young man\'s buckler. Jayadratha fled, and Salya,\nRajah of Madra, attacked Arjuna\'s noble son. But Bhima dashed forward and\nengaged him in fierce combat. Both were mighty wielders of the mace; they were\nlike two tigers, like two great elephants; they were like eagles rending one\nanother with blood-red claws. The sound of their blows was like the echoing\nthunder, and each stood as steadfast as a cliff which is struck in vain by\nfiery lightning. . . . At length both staggered and fell, but Bhima at once\nsprang up to strike the final blow. Ere he could accomplish his fierce desire,\nhowever, Salya was rescued by his followers and carried to a place of safety.\n. . . Thereafter the battle raged with more fury than ever, until night fell\nand hid from sight all the dead and the living.\n\nDrona sought to fulfil his vow on the second day of his command, and he\nprompted Susarman, the rajah who had invaded Virata when the Pandavas were\nservants there, to send a challenge for single combat to Arjuna. Susarman\nselected a place apart. Arjuna fought many hours, until he put the boastful\nrajah and his followers to flight; then he taunted them for their cowardice.\nMeanwhile Drona had dashed upon Yudhishthira, who, when confronted by certain\ndownfall, leapt on the hack of a swift steed and escaped from the battlefield.\nBut it was no shame for a Kshatriya to flee before a Brahman.\n\nDuryodhana went against Bhima: he was wounded after a brief combat, and\nretreated from the field. Many warriors then pressed against Bhima, but Arjuna\nhad returned\n\np. 298\n\nafter fighting Susarman, and drove furiously against the Kauravas; in triumph\nhe swept over the blood-red plain. Karna watched his rival with jealous wrath\nand entered the fray. The fire burned redly in his eyes, and he attacked\nArjuna, resolved to conquer or to die. Uncertain and long was the conflict,\nand when night fell the two great warriors withdrew\n[reluctantly](errata.htm#2) from the field.\n\nDrona on the morrow arranged his army like to a spider\'s web, and once again\nSusarman challenged Arjuna, so as to draw him from the battle-front. It was\nthe day of Abhimanyu\'s triumph and the day of his death. Yudhishthira sent\nArjuna\'s son to break the web of foemen, and he rode his chariot against\nelephants and steeds with conquering fury. Duryodhana attacked the youthful\nhero with a band of warriors, but fell wounded by Abhimanyu, who also slew the\nwarriors. Salya next dashed against Arjuna\'s son, but ere long he was carried\nfrom the field grievously wounded. Then Duhsasana came forward, frowning and\nfierce.\n\nAbhimanyu cried out: "Base prince, who plotted with Shakuni to win the kingdom\nof Yudhishthira and put Draupadi to shame, I welcome thee, for I have waited\nlong for thee. Now thou wilt receive meet punishment for thy sins."\n\nAs he spake, the fearless youth flung a dart, and Duhsasana fell stunned and\nbleeding, but was rescued from death by his followers.\n\nProudly rode Lakshmana, son of Duryodhana, against Arjuna\'s son, and fought\nbravely and well; but he was cut down, and died upon the battlefield.\n\nThen it was that the evil Jayadratha, who had vowed to be the slave of\nYudhishthira in the forest, advanced stealthily with six warriors to fight\nwith the lordly youth. Round him they surged like howling billows; alone stood\n\np. 299\n\n[paragraph continues] Abhimanyu, and seven were against him. His charioteer\nwas slain and his chariot was shattered; he leapt to the ground and fought on,\nslaying one by one. . . . Perceiving his peril, the Pandavas endeavoured to\nrescue Arjuna\'s son; but Jayadratha held them back, and Karna aided him. At\nlength Abhimanyu was wounded on the forehead, blood streamed into his eyes and\nblinded him, and he stumbled. Ere he could recover, the son of Duhsasana leapt\nforward and dashed out his brains with a mace. So died the gallant youth, pure\nas he was at birth. He died like to a forest lion surrounded by hunters; he\nsank like to the red sun at evening; he perished like to a tempest whose\nstrength is spent; he was spent out even like a fire which has consumed a\nforest and is extinguished on the plain; Abhimanyu was lost as is the serene\nwhite moon when shrouded in black eclipse.\n\nSo that day\'s battle ended, and Abhimanyu slumbered in the soft starlight,\nlifeless and cold.\n\nWhen it was told to Arjuna that his son was slain, the mighty warrior wept\nsilently and lay upon the ground. At length he leapt up and cried: "May the\ncurse of a father and the vengeance of a warrior smite the murderers of my\nboy! . . . May I never reach heaven if I do not slay Jayadratha on the morrow.\n. . ." A spy hastened to the camp of the Kauravas and told of the vow which\nArjuna had taken. Jayadratha trembled with fear.\n\nEarly next morning Arjuna spake to Krishna, saying: "Drive swiftly, for this\nwill be a day of great slaughter." He desired to find Jayadratha; with him\nwent Bhima and Satyaki. Many warriors engaged them in battle, for the Kauravas\nhoped to contrive that the sun should go down ere Arjuna could fulfil his\nterrible vow.\n\nMounted on an elephant, Duhsasana opposed Arjuna; but the lordly tusker took\nflight when the rattling chariot\n\np. 300\n\ndrew nigh. Drona blocked the way; but Arjuna refused combat, saying: "Thou art\nas a father unto me. . . . Let me find the slayer of my son. . . ." He passed\non. Then Duryodhana came up and engaged him. Karna fought with Bhima, and\nBhurisrava attacked Satyaki. Long waged the bitter conflicts, and at length\nKrishna perceived that his kinsman was about to be slain. He called to Arjuna,\nwho cast a celestial weapon at Bhurisrava, which cut off both his arms; then\nSatyaki slew him. Many warriors confronted Arjuna thereafter, and many fell.\nBut the day wore on and evening drew nigh, and he could not find Jayadratha.\nAt length Arjuna bade Krishna to drive furiously onward, and to pause not\nuntil he found the slayer of his son. The chariot sped like to a whirlwind,\nuntil at length Arjuna beheld the evil-hearted Jayadratha; he was guarded by\nKarna and five great warriors, and at that time the sun had begun to set.\n\nKarna leapt forward and engaged Arjuna; but Krishna, by reason of his divine\npower, caused a dark cloud to obscure the sun, whereupon all men believed that\nnight had fallen. Karna at once withdrew; but Arjuna drove on, and as the sun\nshot forth its last ray of dazzling light, he dashed upon Jayadratha as a\nfalcon swoops down upon its prey. Brief was the struggle, for ere daylight\nfaded utterly, Arjuna overthrew the slayer of his son and cut off his head.\nBhima uttered a roar of triumph when he saw the head of Jayadratha held aloft,\nand the Kauravas sorrowed greatly because that their wicked design had been\nthwarted.\n\nNight fell, but the fighting was renewed. In the darkness and confusion men\nslew their kinsmen, fathers cut down their sons, and brothers fought against\nbrothers. Yudhishthira sent men with torches to light up the blood-red\n\np. 301\n\nplain, and the battle was waged for many hours. Swords were splintered and\nspears were lost, and warriors threw great boulders and chariot wheels against\none another. All men were maddened with the thirst for blood, and the night\nwas filled with horrors.\n\nAt length Arjuna called for a truce, and it was agreed that the warriors\nshould sleep on the battlefield. So all lay down, the charioteer in his\nchariot, the horseman on his steed, and the driver of the elephant on his\nelephant\'s hack. . . .\n\nDuryodhana reproached Drona because that he did not slay the Pandavas in their\nsleep. . . . "Let Karna," he said, "lead the hosts to victory."\n\nSaid Drona: "Thou art reaping the red harvest of thy sins. . . . But know now\nthat on the morrow either Arjuna will fall or I will be slain by him."\n\nWhen the bright moon rose in the heavens the conflict was renewed. Many fell\non that awful night. Ghatotkacha, the Rakshasa son of Bhima, was foremost in\nthe fray, and he slaughtered numerous Kaurava warriors. At length Karna went\nagainst him, and then the air was filled with blazing arrows. Each smote the\nother with powerful weapons, and for a time the issue hung in the balance.\nGhatotkacha created illusions, but Karna kept his senses in that great fight,\neven after his steeds had been slain; he leapt to the ground, then flung a\ncelestial dart, the gift of Indra, and Ghatotkacha, uttering terrible cries,\nfell down and breathed his last breath. The Kauravas shouted with gladness,\nand the Pandavas shed tears of sorrow.\n\nEre the night was ended, Drona slew his ancient enemy Drupada, Rajah of\nSouthern Panchala, and he cut down also the Rajah of Virata.\n\nEre dawn broke, Dhrishta-dyumna, son of Drupada,\n\np. 302\n\nwent forth to search for Drona, the slayer of his beloved sire.\n\nSaid Bhima: "Thou art too young to strike down so great a warrior as Drona. I\nwill fight with him until he is wearied, then thou canst approach and be\navenged."\n\nBhima struggled with the sage, his preceptor, for many hours; then Dhrishta-\ndyumna engaged him, but neither could prevail over the slayer of Drupada.\n\nAt length the Pandava warriors shouted falsely: "Aswatthaman, son of Drona, is\nslain."\n\nWhen Drona heard the dread tidings, he fainted in his chariot, and vengeful\nDhrishta-dyumna rushed forward and cut off his head. Then the son of Drupada\nthrew the head of Drona towards Duryodhana, saying: "Here is the head of thy\nmighty warrior; I will cut off the heads of each Kaurava prince in like\nmanner."\n\nThe fall of Drona was like the sinking of heaven\'s sun; it was like the drying\nup of the ocean; the Kauravas fled away in fear.\n\nTerrible was the grief of Aswatthaman when he approached at eventide and found\nthat his sire had been slain. Night fell while he sorrowed, and he vowed to\nslay Dhrishta-dyumna and all his kindred.\n\nKarna was then chosen to be the leader of the Kaurava army, and Duryodhana\nhailed him with joy and said: "Thou alone canst stem the tide of our\ndisasters. Arjuna hath been spared by Bhishma and by Drona because that they\nloved him. But the arm of Karna is strengthened by hatred of the proud Pandava\narcher."\n\nWhen morning broke over the plain of Kuru-kshetra, the first battle of Karna\nbegan, and it continued all day long. Countless warriors were slain; blood ran\nin streams, and the dead and mangled bodies of men and elephants and horses\nwere strewn in confusion. The air was\n\np. 303\n\ndarkened with arrows and darts, and it rang with the shouts of the fighters\nand the moans of the wounded, the bellowing of trumpets, and the clamour of\ndrums.\n\nAt length evening came on and the carnage ended. . . . Duryodhana summoned a\ncouncil of war and said: This is the sixteenth day of the war, and many of our\nstrongest heroes have fallen. Bhishma and Drona have fallen, and many of my\nbrethren are now dead."\n\nSaid Karna: "To-morrow will be the great day of the war. I have vowed to slay\nArjuna or fall by his hand."\n\nDuryodhana was cheered by Karna\'s words, and all the Kauravas were once more\nhopeful of victory.\n\nIn the morning Karna went forth in his chariot. He chose for his driver Salya,\nRajah of Madra, whose skill was so great that even Krishna was not his\nsuperior.\n\nArjuna was again engaged in combat with Susarman when Karna attacked the\nPandava army. So the son of Surya went against Yudhishthira and cast him on\nthe ground, saying: "If thou wert Arjuna I would slay thee."\n\nBhima then attacked Karna, and they fought fiercely for a time, until Arjuna,\nhaving overcome Susarman, returned again to combat with Karna.\n\nDuhsasana, who put Draupadi to shame, came up to help Karna, and Bhima sprang\nupon him. Now Bhima had long desired to meet this evil-hearted son of the\nblind maharajah, so that he might fulfil his vow. He swung his mace and struck\nso mighty a blow that the advancing chariot was shattered. Duhsasana fell\nheavily upon the ground and broke his back. Then Bhima seized him and,\nwhirling his body aloft, cried out: "O Kauravas, come ye who dare and rescue\nthe helper of Karna."\n\nNo one ventured to approach, and Bhima cast down Duhsasana\'s body, cut off his\nhead, and drank his blood\n\np. 304\n\nas he had vowed to do. "Ho! ho!" he cried, "never have I tasted a sweeter\ndraught. . . ."\n\nMany Kaurava warriors fled, and they cried out: "This is not a man, for he\ndrinketh human blood."\n\nAll men watched the deadly combat which was waged between the mighty heroes\nArjuna and Karna. They began by shooting arrows one at another, while Krishna\nand Salya guided the chariots with prowess and care. The arrows of Arjuna fell\nupon Karna like to summer rain; Karna\'s arrows were like stinging snakes, and\nthey drank blood. At length Arjuna\'s celestial bow Gandiva was struck and the\nbow-string severed. . . .\n\nArjuna said: "Pause, O Karna. According to the rules of battle, thou canst not\nattack a disabled foe-man."\n\nBut Karna heeded not. He showered countless arrows, until his proud rival was\nwounded grievously on the breast.\n\nWhen Arjuna had restrung his bow, he rose up like to a stricken and angry\ntiger held at bay, and cast a screen of arrows against his foe. But Karna\nfeared him not, nor could Arjuna bear him down. The issue hung in the balance.\n. . .\n\nThen suddenly a wheel of Karna\'s chariot sank in the soft ground, nor could\nSalya urge the horses to advance.\n\nKarna cried out: "Pause now, O Arjuna, nor wage unequal war. It is not manly\nto attack a helpless enemy."\n\nArjuna paused; but Krishna spake quickly, saying: "O Karna, thou speakest\ntruly; but was it manly to shoot arrows at Arjuna whilst he engaged himself\nrestringing his bow? Was it manly to scoff at Draupadi when she was put to\nshame before elders and princes in\n\np. 305\n\nthe gambling hall? Was it manly of thee and six warriors to surround Abhimanyu\nso as to murder him without compassion?"\n\nWhen Arjuna heard his son\'s name, his heart burned with consuming wrath.\nSnatching from his quiver a crescent-bladed arrow, he drew his bow and shot it\nat Karna, whose head was immediately struck off.\n\nSo fell in that dread combat a brother by a brother\'s hand.\n\nThe Kauravas fled in terror when Karna was slain, and Kripa said unto\nDuryodhana: "Now that our greatest warriors are dead, it would be well to sue\nfor peace."\n\nSaid Duryodhana: "After the wrongs I have done the Pandavas, how can I ask or\nexpect mercy at their hands? Let the war go on till the end comes."\n\nSalya was then chosen as the leader of the Kaurava army, which had greatly\nshrunken in numbers, and on the morning of the eighteenth day of the war the\nbattle was waged with fury. But the Pandavas were irresistible, and when\nDuryodhana perceived that they were sweeping all before them, he fled away\nsecretly, carrying his mace. He had power to hide under water as long as he\ndesired, by reason of a mighty charm which had been conferred upon him by the\ndemons; so he plunged into a lake and lay concealed below the waters.\n\nSalya was slain by Yudhishthira, and he fell like to a thunder-splintered\nrock. Sahadeva overthrew false Shakuni, the gambler, who had played against\nYudhishthira with loaded dice, and Bhima cut down all Duryodhana\'s brethren\nwho had survived until that last fateful day. Of all the Kaurava heroes there\nthen remained alive only Aswa-thaman, son of Drona, Kripa, and Kritavarman,\nand the hidden Duryodhana.\n\nAt length Bhima discovered where Duryodhana was\n\np. 306\n\nconcealed. Yudhishthira went to the lake side and urged him to come forth and\nfight.\n\nSaid Duryodhana: "Take my kingdom now and have pleasure in it. Depart and\nleave me, for I must retire to the jungle and engage in meditation."\n\nYudhishthira said: "I cannot accept aught from thee except what is won in\nbattle."\n\nSaid Duryodhana: "If you promise to fight one by one, I will come out of the\nwater and slay you all." r\n\nYudhishthira said: "Come forth, and the battle will be fought as thou dost\ndesire. Now thou hast spoken as becomes a Kshatriya."\n\nStill Duryodhana tarried, and Bhima shouted: "If thou dost not come out of the\nlake at once, I will plunge in and drag thee to the shore."\n\nThen Duryodhana came forth, and the Pandavas laughed to see him, for he was\ncovered with mire, and water streamed down from his raiment.\n\nSaid Duryodhana: "Soon will your merriment be turned to grief."\n\nNow, all during the time of the Pandava exile, Duryodhana had practised with\nthe mace, so that he became the equal of Bhima. But he had no one to support\nhim there. The other survivors remained in hiding. Then Balarama appeared, and\nhe caused the combat to be waged in the middle of the blood-red plain; he was\nDuryodhana\'s supporter.\n\nThe warriors fought like two fierce bulls, and smote one another heavy blows,\nuntil their faces were reddened with blood. Once Duryodhana almost achieved\nvictory, for he struck Bhima on the head so that all present thought that the\nPandava hero had received his deathblow. Bhima staggered but recovered\nhimself, and soon afterwards he struck Duryodhana a foul blow upon the knee,\nwhich\n\np. 307\n\nsmashed the bone so that he fell prostrate. Thus was the vow of Bhima\nfulfilled. . . .\n\nHe danced round Duryodhana a time, then, kicking his enemy\'s head, cried out\nat length: "Draupadi is avenged."\n\nYudhishthira was wroth; he smote Bhima on the face and said: "O accursed\nvillain, thou wilt cause all men to speak ill of us."\n\nThen Arjuna led Bhima away, and Yudhishthira knelt beside Duryodhana and said:\n"Thou art still our ruler, and if thou wilt order me to slay Bhima, thy\ncommand will be obeyed. Thou art now very nigh unto death, and I sorrow for\nthe Kaurava wives and children, who will curse us because that thou hast been\nlaid low."\n\nSaid Balarama: "Bhima hath broken the laws of combat, for he smote Duryodhana\nbelow the waist."\n\nKrishna said: "My brother, did not Duryodhana wrong the Pandavas with foul\nplay at dice? And did not Bhima, when he beheld Draupadi put to shame, vow to\nbreak the knee of Duryodhana?"\n\nSaid Balarama: "So thou dost approve of this? . . . Can I forget that Bhima\nkicked the head of our wounded kinsman, the rajah?"\n\nKrishna stayed the vengeful hand of Balarama, and prevailed upon him to take\nvows not to fight against the Pandavas.\n\nWhen night fell, the dying Duryodhana was visited on the battlefield by\nAswatthaman, son of Drona, and Kripa, and Kritavarman. Unto Aswatthaman he\ngave permission to attack the Pandavas while yet they slumbered. . . . Then\nDrona\'s son went forth in the darkness to glut his hunger for vengeance\nbecause that his sire had been slain. . . . The pale stars looked down on the\ndead and the dying as Aswatthaman crossed the\n\np. 308\n\nbattleplain and went stealthily towards the tents of his foemen, with Kripa\nand Kritavarman.\n\nAt the gate of the Pandava camp an awful figure rose up against the\nconspirators. Aswatthaman was not afraid, and he fought with his adversary\nuntil he perceived that he was the god Shiva, the Blue-throated Destroyer.\nThen Drona\'s son drew back, and on an altar he kindled a fire to worship the\nall-powerful deity. Then, having naught else to sacrifice, he cast his own\nbody upon the flames. By this supremely pious act Shiva was propitiated; he\naccepted Drona\'s son and entered his body, saying: "Hitherto, for the sake of\nKrishna, have I protected the sons of Draupadi, but now their hour of doom\nhath come."\n\nThen Aswatthaman rushed into the camp and slaughtered with the cruel arm of\nvengeance. Rudely he awakened Dhrihsta-dyumna, who cried out: "Coward! wouldst\nthou attack a naked man?"\n\nAswatthaman answered not his father\'s slayer, but took his life with a single\nblow. . . . Through the camp he went, striking down each one he met, and\nshrieks and moans arose on every side.\n\nDraupadi was awakened by the clamour, and her five young sons sprang up to\nprotect her. Aswatthaman slew each one without pity. . . . Then he lit a great\nfire to discover those who had concealed themselves, and with reeking hands he\ncompleted his ghastly work of slaughter. Meanwhile Kripa and Kritavarman, with\nweapons in their hands, kept watch at the gate, and cut down all who\nendeavoured to escape.\n\nNow the Pandava princes slept safely on that night of horror in the camp of\nthe Kauravas, so that they escaped the sword of Drona\'s son.\n\nWhen his fell work was accomplished, the blood-thirsty\n\np. 309\n\nAswatthaman cut off the heads of Draupadi\'s five sons and carried them to\nDuryodhana, who rejoiced greatly, believing that they were the heads of\nYudhishthira and his brethren. But when he perceived that the avenger of night\nhad slain the children of Draupadi instead, he cried out: "Alas! what horror\nhast thou committed? Thou hast slain innocent children, who, had they lived,\nwould have perpetuated our name and our fame. My heart burns with anger\nagainst the sires and not their harmless sons."\n\nDuryodhana groaned heavily: his heart was op-pressed with grief, and, bowing\ndown his head, he died sorrowing.\n\nThen Aswatthaman and Kripa and Kritavarman fled away, fearing the wrath of the\nPandavas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[287:1](iml23.htm#fr_280) The late Professor H.
