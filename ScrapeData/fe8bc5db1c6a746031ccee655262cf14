S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a spoke :-- Then the King of the Danavas, very powerful,\nbowed down to Mahadeva and ascended on the chariot with his ministers.\nMahadeva gave orders to His army to be ready at once. So S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a did.\nTerrible fight then ensued between Mahendra and Vri _s_ aparva, Bhaskara and\nViprachitti, Nis\xc2\x92akara and Dambha, between Kala and Kales\xc2\x92vara, between Fire\nand Gokar _n_ a, Kuvera and Kalakeya, between Vis\xc2\x92vakarma and Maya, between\nMrityu and Bhayamkar, between Yama and Samhara, between Varu _n_ a and\nVikamka, between Budha and Dhritapri _st_ ha, between S\xc2\x92ani and Raktak _s_ a,\nJayanta and Ratnasara, between the Vasus and Varchasas, between the two As\xc2\x92vin\nKumaras and Diptiman, between Nalakubara and Dhumra, between Dharma and\nDhurandhara, between Mangala and U _s_ ak _s_ a, Bhanu and S\xc2\x92ovakara, between\nKandarpa and Pi _t_ hara, between the eleven \xc3\x82dityas and Godhamukha, Chur _n_\na and Kha _d_ gadhvaja, Ka\xc3\xb1chimukha and Pi _nd_ a, Dhumra and Nandi, between\nVis\xc2\x92va and Palas\xc2\x92a, between the eleven Rudras and the eleven Bhayamkaras,\nbetween Ugracha _nd_ a and the other Mahamaris and Nandis\xc2\x92vara and the other\nDanavas. The battlefield, then, assumed a grim aspect, as if the time of\nDissolution had come. Bhagavan Mahadeva sat under the Va _t_ a (peepul) tree\nwith Kartikeya and Bhadrakali. S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, decked with his jewel\nornaments, sat on the jewel throne, surrounded by ko _t_ is and ko _t_ is of\nDanavas. The S\xc2\x92ankara\xc2\x92s army got defeated at the hands of the Danavas. The\nDevas, with cuts and wounds on\n\n\n\np. 893\n\n\n\ntheir bodies, fled from the battlefield, terrified. Kartikeya gave words\n\xc2\x93Don't fear\xc2\x94 to the Devas and excited them. Only Skanda resisted the Danava\nforces. In one moment he slew one hundred Ak _s_ auhi _n_ i Danava forces. The\nlotus eyed Kali also engaged in killing the Asuras. She became very angry and\nno sooner did She slay the Asura forces, than She began to drink their blood.\nShe easily slew with Her one hand and at every time put into Her mouth ten\nlakhs, and hundred lakhs and Ko _t_ is and Ko _t_ is of elephants. Thousands\nand thousands of headless bodies (Kavandhas) came to be witnessed in the\nfield. The bodies of the Danavas were all cut and wounded by the arrows of\nKartikeya. They were all terrified and fled away. Only Vri _s_ aparva,\nViprachitti, Dambha, and Vikamka _n_ ah remained fighting with Skanda with an\nheroic valour. Mahamari, too, did not shew his back and he fought out\nvigorously. By and by they all became very much confused and distressed; but\nthey did not turn their backs. Seeing this terrible fight of Skanda, the Devas\nbegan to shower flowers. The killing of the Danavas looked like a Prakritik\nDissolution. S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, then, began to shoot arrows from his chariot.\n\n\n\nThe shooting of arrows by the king seemed as if rains were being poured in by\nthe clouds. Everything became pitch dark. Fires only were seen emitting their\ngolden tongues. The Devas, Nandis\xc2\x92vara and others, fled away, terrified. Only\nKartikeya remained in the battlefield. Then S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a began to throw\nterribly showers and showers of mountains, snakes, stones, and trees. So much\nso, that Kartikeya was covered by them as the Sun becomes obscured by fog. The\nDemon King cut off the weighty quiver and the pedestal of Skanda and broke His\nchariot. By the divine weapons of the Danava, the peacock (the vehicle) of\nKartikeya became exhausted. Kartikeya threw one S\xc2\x92akti (weapon) on the breast\nof the Danava; but before it fell, the Danava cut off that, lustrous like the\nSun and, in return, darted his S\xc2\x92akti. By that stroke, Kartikeya became\nstunned for a moment; but he immediately regained his consciousness. He then\ntook up the quiver that Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u gave him before and many other\nweapons; and ascending on another chariot, built of jewels, began to fight out\nviolently and valiantly. Getting angry, he resisted all those showers of\nsnakes, mountains and trees by his divine weapons. He resisted fire by his\nwatery (Paryannya) weapon. Then He cut off easily S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a\xc2\x92s chariot,\nbow, armour, charioteer, and his bright crown and he threw on his breast one\nblazing S\xc2\x92akti of white colour. The Danavendra fell unconscious; but, at the\nnext moment, he regained his consciousness quickly, mounted on another chariot\nand took a fresh quiver. The Danava was the foremost in his magic powers. He,\nby his power of Maya, made a shower of arrows so much so that\n\n\n\np. 894\n\n\n\nKartikeya became completely covered by that multitude of arrows. Then the\nDanava took one invincible S\xc2\x92akti, lustrous like one hundred Suns. It seemed\nthat flames of fire were licking high as if the Dissolution Time had come\naright. Inflamed by anger, the Danava threw that S\xc2\x92akti on Kartikeya. It\nseemed, then, that a burning mass of fire fell on him. The powerful Kartikeya\nbecame senseless. Bhadrakali immediately took Him on Her lap and carried him\nbefore S\xc2\x92iva. S\xc2\x92iva easily restored him to his life by his knowledge-power and\ngave him the indomitable strength. He then got up in full vigour. Bhadrakali\nwent to the field to see the Kartikeya\xc2\x92s forces. Nandis\xc2\x92vara and other heroes,\nthe Devas, Gandharbas, Yak _s_ as, Rak _s_ asas and Kinnaras followed Her.\nHundreds of war drums were sounded and hundreds of persons carried Madhu\n(wine). Going to the battle-ground, She gave a war-cry. The Danava forces got\nfainted by that cry. Bhadrakali shouted aloud inauspicious peals after peals\nof laughter. Then She drank Madhu and danced in the battlefield. Ugra Dam _st_\nra, Ugracha _nd_ a, Ko _t_ avi, the Yoginis, Dakinis, and the Devas all drank\nMadhu (wine). Seeing Kali in the battlefield, S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a came up again\nand imparted the spirit of Fearlessness to the Daityas, trembling with fear.\nBhadrakali projected, then, the Fire weapon, flaming like the Great\nDissolution Fire; but the king quickly put out that by the Watery weapon. Kali\nthen projected the very violent and wonderful Varu _n_ astra. The Danava cut\noff that easily with Gandharbastra. Kali then threw the flame-like\nMahes\xc2\x92varastra. The king made it futile by the Vai _sn_ avastra. Then the Devi\npurifying the Naraya _n_ astra with the mantra, threw it on the king. At this\nthe king instantly alighted from his chariot and bowed down to it. The Naraya\n_n_ astra rose high up like the Dissolution Fire. S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a fell\nprostrate on the ground with devotion. The Devi threw, then, the Brahmastra,\npurifying it with Mantra. But it was rendered futile by the Danava\xc2\x92s\nBrahmastra. The Devi again shot the divine weapons purifying them with\nmantras; but they also were nullified by the divine weapons of the Danava.\nThen Bhadrakali threw one S\xc2\x92akti extending to one Yojana. The Daitya cut it to\npieces by his divine weapon. The Devi, then, being very much enraged, became\nready to throw Pas\xc2\x92upata \xc3\x82stra, when the Incorporeal Voice was heard from the\nHeavens, prohibiting Her, and saying, \xc2\x93O Devi! The high-souled Danava would\nnot be killed by the Pas\xc2\x92upata weapon. For Brahma granted him this boon that\nuntil the Vi _sn_ u\xc2\x92s Kavacha will remain on his neck and until his wife\xc2\x92s\nchastity be not violated, old age and death will not be able to touch him.\xc2\x94\nHearing this Celestial Voice, the Devi at once desisted. But She, out of\nhunger, devoured hundreds and lakhs of Danavas. The terrible Devi Kali, then,\nwent with great speed to devour S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a but the Danava resisted Her\nby his sharp\n\n\n\np. 895\n\n\n\ndivine weapons. The Devi then threw on him a powerful axe, lustrous like a\nsummer Sun; but the Danava cut it to pieces by his divine weapon. The Devi\nseeing this, became very angry and proceeded to devour him; but the Danava\nKing, the Lord of all Siddhis, expanded his body. At this, Kali became\nviolently angry and assuming a terrific appearance, went quickly and with the\nblow of one fist, broke his chariot and dropped down the charioteer. Then she\nhurled on the Asura one S\xc2\x92ula weapon, blazing like a Pralaya Fire. S\xc2\x92ankhachu\n_d_ a easily held that by his left hand. The Devi became angry and struck the\nDanava with Her fist; the Daitya\xc2\x92s head reeled, and, rolling, he fell\nunconscious for a moment. Next moment regaining his consciousness he got up.\nBut he did not fight hand to hand with the Devi. Rather he bowed down to Her.\nThe weapons that the Devi threw afterwards were partly cut down by the Danava\nand partly taken up by him and absorbed in him and thus rendered futile. Then\nBhadrakali caught bold of the Danava and whirling him round and round threw\nhim aloft. Then the powerful S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a fell down on the ground from\nhigh with great force; he immediately\n\ngot up and bowed down to Her. He then gladly ascended on his beautiful\nchariot, built of excellent jewels. He did not feel any fatigue with the war\nand went on fighting. Then the Devi Bhadrakali, feeling hungry began to drink\nthe blood of the Danavas and ate the fat and flesh. She came before Mahadeva\nand described to Him the whole history of the warfare from beginning to end.\nHearing the killing of the Danavas, Mahadeva began to laugh. She went on\nsaying, \xc2\x93The Danavas that get out of my mouth while I was chewing them, are\nthe only ones that are living. This number will be about one lakh. And when I\ntook up the Pas\xc2\x92upata weapon to kill the Danava, the Incorporeal Celestial\nVoice spoke :-- He is invulnerable by you. But the very powerful Danava did no\nmore fling any weapon on Me. He simply cut to pieces those that I threw on\nhim.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-Second Chapter in the Ninth Book on the fight between the\nDevas and S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 23](bk09ch23.htm)\n\n"
