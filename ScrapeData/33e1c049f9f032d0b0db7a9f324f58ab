Brahman (in the shape of pra _n_ a, breath) entered into that man by the\ntips of his feet, and because Brahman entered (prapadyata) into that man by\nthe tips of his feet, therefore people call them the tips of the feet\n(prapada), but hoofs and claws in other animals.\n\n2\\. Then Brahman crept up higher, and therefore they were (called) 1 the\nthighs (uru).\n\n3\\. Then he said: 'Grasp wide,' and that was (called) the belly (udara).\n\n4\\. Then he said: 'Make room for me,' and that was (called) the chest (uras).\n\n5\\. The _S_ arkarakshyas meditate on the belly as Brahman, the \xc3\x82ru _n_ is on\nthe heart 2. Both (these places) are Brahman indeed 3.\n\n6\\. But Brahman crept upwards and came to the head, and because he came to the\nhead, therefore the head is called head 4.\n\n7\\. Then these delights alighted in the head, sight, hearing, mind, speech,\nbreath.\n\n8\\. Delights alight on him who thus knows, why the head is called head.\n\n9\\. These (five delights or senses) strove together, saying: 'I am the uktha\n(hymn), I am the uktha 5.' 'Well,' they said, 'let us all go out from\n\np. 207\n\nthis body; then on whose departure this body shall fall, he shall be the uktha\namong us 1.'\n\n10\\. Speech went out, yet the body without speaking remained, eating and\ndrinking.\n\nSight went out, yet the body without seeing remained, eating and drinking.\n\nHearing went out, yet the body without hearing remained, eating and drinking.\n\nMind went out, yet the body, as if blinking, remained, eating and drinking.\n\nBreath went out, then when breath was gone out, the body fell.\n\n11\\. It was decayed, and because people said, it decayed, therefore it was\n(called) body ( _s_ arira). That is the reason of its name.\n\n12\\. If a man knows this, then the evil enemy who hates him decays, or the\nevil enemy who hates him is defeated.\n\n13\\. They strove again, saying: 'I am the uktha, I am the uktha.' 'Well,' they\nsaid, 'let us enter that body again; then on whose entrance this body shall\nrise again, he shall be the uktha among us.'\n\n14\\. Speech entered, but the body lay still. Sight entered, but the body lay\nstill. Hearing entered, but the body lay still. Mind entered, but the body lay\nstill. Breath entered, and when breath had entered, the body rose, and it\nbecame the uktha.\n\n15\\. Therefore breath alone is the uktha.\n\n16\\. Let people know that breath is the uktha indeed.\n\n17\\. The Devas (the other senses) said to breath: 'Thou art the uktha, thou\nart all this, we are thine, thou art ours.'\n\np. 208\n\n18\\. This has also been said by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. VIII, 92, 32): 'Thou art ours,\nwe are thine.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[206:1](sbe01205.htm#fr_511) These are all plays on words.
