I praise [1](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:1:1) now the powerful company of these\never-young Maruts, who drive violently along with quick horses; aye, the\nsovereigns are lords of Am _ri_ ta (the immortal).\n\n2\\. The terrible company, the powerful, adorned with quoits on their hands,\ngiven to roaring, potent, dispensing treasures, they who are beneficent,\ninfinite in greatness, praise, O poet, these men of great wealth!\n\n3\\. May your water-carriers come here to-day, all the Maruts who stir up the\nrain. That fire which has been lighted for you, O Maruts, accept it, O young\nsingers\n\n4\\. O worshipful Maruts, you create for man an active king, fashioned by\nVibhvan [1](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:4:1); from you comes the man who can fight\nwith his fist, and is quick with his arm, from you the man with good horses\nand valiant heroes.\n\n5\\. Like the spokes of a wheel, no one is last, like the days they are born on\nand on, not deficient in might. The very high sons of P _ri_ _s_ ni are full\nof fury, the Marut cling firmly to their own will\n[1](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:5:1).\n\n6\\. When you have come forth with your speckled deer as horses\n[1](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:6:1) on strong-fellied chariots, O Maruts, the waters\ngush, the forests go asunder [2](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:6:2);--let Dyu\n[3](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:6:3) (Sky) roar down, the bull of the Dawn.\n\n7\\. At their approach, even the earth opened wide,\n\np. 344\n\nand they placed (sowed) their own [1](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:7:1) strength (the\nrain), as a husband the germ. Indeed they have harnessed the winds as horses\nto the yoke, and the men of Rudra have changed their sweat into rain.\n\n8\\. Hark, O heroes, O Maruts! Be gracious to us! You who are of great bounty,\nimmortal, righteous, truly listening to us, poets, young, dwelling on mighty\nmountains, and grown mighty.\n\np. 345\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same poet and deity. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh. None of the verses occurs in\nSV., VS., AV., TS. Verses 3 and 5 are found in TB. II, 5, 5, 3; II, 8, 5, 7;\nMS. IV, 11, 2; IV, 4, 18.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. On stushe, see M. M., Selected Essays, I, p. 162; Wilhelm, De\ninfinitivi forma et usu, p. 10; Bartholomae, in Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XV,\np. 219. I take stushe as 1 pers. sing. Aor. \xc3\x82tm. (not, as Avery, of the\nPresent) in many places where it has been taken as an infinitive. For\ninstance, II, 31, 5; VI, 49, 1; 51, 3 (with vo _k_ e); 62, 1 (with huve);\nVIII, 5, 4; 7, 32; 74, 1; 84, 1 (here the second pada must begin with stushe).\nIt may be an indicative or a subjunctive. As to stushe, without an accent, its\ncharacter cannot be doubtful; see I, 122, 8; 159, 1; V, 33, 6; VI, 21, 2; 48,\n14; VIII, 21, 9; 23, 2; 23, 7 (g _ri_ _n_ e). In II, 20, 4, tam u stushe\nindram tam g _ri_ _n_ ishe, g _ri_ _n_ ishe is an aorist with vikara _n_ a,\nlike punishe, I praise that Indra, I laud him. In I, 46, 1, stushe may be the\ninfinitive, but not necessarily. It is an infinitive in I, 122, 7. stushe sa\nvam varu _n_ a mitra rati _h_ , your gift, Varu _n_ a and Mitra, is to be\npraised. Likewise in VIII, 4, 17 (see BR. s. v. simian); 24, 1; 63, 3, though\nin several of these passages it must remain doubtful whether stushe should be\ntaken as an absolute infinitive, or as a finite verb. In VIII, 65, 5, indra g\n_ri_ _n_ ishe u stushe, means, 'Indra, I laud and praise,' as in II, 20, 4.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Vibhva-tash _t_ a is generally explained as made by a master, or by\nVibhvan, one of the _Ri_ bhus. This may be so, though it seems a bold\nexpression (see Bergaigne, II, 410-411). But may it not be a mere synonym of\nsutash _t_ a, and intended for vibhvane tash _t_ a? see Selected Essays, I, p.\n143.\n\np. 346\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. See Taitt. Br. II, 8, 5, 7. As to mimikshu _h_ , see note to I, 165,\n1.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. On p _r i_shatibhi _h_ a _s_ vai _h_ , see II, 34, 4; V, 55, 6.\nBergaigne's note (II, p. 378) does not settle the question whether the horses\nof the Maruts were speckled, or whether they had speckled deer for their\nhorses.\n\nNote 2. On ri _n_ ate vanani, see V, 57, 3.\n\nNote 3. Dyaus, the father of the Maruts, the oldest and highest god of heaven,\nthe strong bull, or, it may be, the man of the dawn. See v. Bradke, Dyaus\nAsura, p. 63; Bergaigne, I, p. 316.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Roth conjectures svam for svam, taking it as a locative of su,\ngenetrix. This is not without difficulties, nor is it necessary. That we find\nin the Rig-veda no other locative in am after monosyllabic stems in u is\nperhaps no serious objection. But the text as it stands can be translated, 'as\na husband the germ, they have placed (sown) their own strength.' _S_ avas is\nthe same as v _r i_sh _n_ yam and v _r i_sh _n_ i _s_ ava _h_ in VIII, 3, 8;\n10. Dhu _h_ is used like dha in retodha.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 59. To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)](sbe3241.htm)\n\n"
