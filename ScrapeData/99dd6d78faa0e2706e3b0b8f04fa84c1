MISCELLANEOUS (Prakir _n_ aka).\n\n1. 1 This (aggregate of rules concerning) lawsuits instituted by litigants has been briefly declared; I will declare (next the law concerning) Miscellaneous Causes instituted by the king (in person).\n\np. 387\n\n2. 2 In the case of a conflict between two Sm _ri_ tis (texts of law), equity should be resorted to; when the law-books are inapplicable, that course should be followed which is indicated by a consideration of the circumstances of the case.\n\n3. 3 (However) the first rank (among legislators) belongs to Manu, because he has embodied the essence of the Veda in his work; that Sm _ri_ ti (or text of law) which is opposed to the tenor of the laws of Manu is not approved.\n\n4. 4 When he has discovered a man to be an offender, (the king) should inflict (one of the various sorts of punishment) on him, (gentle) admonition, (harsh) reproof or corporal chastisement, or one of the four gradations of fines.\n\n5\\. (Let him inflict) a (gentle) admonition, when the offence is very light;\n(harsh) reproof, for a crime in the first degree; a fine, for a crime in the\n(second or) middlemost degree; and arrest, in the case of high-treason.\n\n6\\. Banishment also may be resorted to by (a king) desirous of promoting his\nown welfare in order to meet opposition, and all (the various) sorts (of\npunishment) should be united in the case of one who has committed a mortal\nsin.\n\n7\\. (The king) should punish elders, domestic priests, and persons commanding\nrespect, with (gentle) admonition only; other litigants he should amerce in a\nfine, when they are found to be guilty;\n\np. 388\n\nand on the perpetrators of a heavy crime he should inflict corporal\npunishment.\n\n8. 8 (Gentle) admonition and (harsh) reproof are declared to be the privilege of the Brahman (appointed as chief judge); but both fines and corporal punishment may be inflicted by the king only.\n\n9. 9 Both hands, both feet, the male organ, the eye, the tongue, both ears, the nose, the neck, one half of the feet, the thumb and index, the forehead, the lips, the hindpart, and the hips:\n\n10\\. These fourteen places of punishment have been indicated. For a Brahman,\nbranding him on the forehead is ordained as the only kind of punishment.\n\n11. 11 A Brahman, though a mortal sinner, shall not suffer capital punishment; the king shall banish him, and cause him to be branded and shaved.\n\n12. 12 That man who deserves capital punishment shall be compelled to pay one hundred _S_ uvar _n_ as; one deserving to have a limb cut off, half as much; and one deserving to have the thumb and index (cut off), half of that.\n\n13. 13 The eighteen titles of law have been explained, together with the particulars of plaint and answer. Learn now (the law regarding) the relative validity of transactions.\n\n14\\. That transaction which has been prior in time (to another) shall be\nupheld. If it is departed from, that is (called) an alteration of a\ntransaction.\n\n15\\. If a creditor or debtor revokes a previous\n\np. 389\n\nagreement and makes another contract of the same description, (in which a)\ngreater or less (amount is stated), it is termed an alteration of a\ntransaction.\n\n16\\. When (a debtor) having received a loan at the rate of two per cent. (in\nthe month) promises to pay five per cent., that subsequent agreement is valid.\n\n17\\. Between two successive transactions, the first is (rendered) void (by the\nsecond); a subsequent agreement prevails over the one preceding it in time.\n\n18\\. When a man first makes a deposit and converts it into a pledge\nafterwards, after receiving money (for it), or sells it, the second\ntransaction prevails over the first.\n\n[19. 19 Forbidden practices are found among the Southerners in the present\nday, (such as) matches with a maternal uncle's daughter, in spite of the\nprohibited degree of relationship on the mother's side (causing such unions to\nbe illegal).\n\n20\\. The highly reprehensible custom of a brother living with his deceased\nbrother's wife, and the delivery of a marriageable damsel to a family is found\nin other countries.\n\n21\\. What is more, matches with a mother occur among the Parasikas. The\ninhabitants of some countries do not allow the presentation of fresh gifts (of\nfood) at a _S_ raddha offering to those Brahmans who have been fed at a _S_\nraddha held on the eleventh\n\np. 390\n\nday (after the decease of a person) or at some other _S_ raddha.\n\n22\\. Others, after lending grain, take twice as much back in the autumn season\nand occupy the embanked land, after having received twice the amount lent,\n\n23\\. Though the principal has been repaid. This is reprehensible also. Such\nforbidden practices (the king) should check (when they are resorted to)\nthrough folly.\n\n24\\. Such customs as are not opposed to the laws of particular countries and\ncastes or other (corporations), every king should establish in accordance with\nthe sacred law, after consulting the law-books.]\n\n25. 25 Thus let the king every day examine, in common with learned Brahmans, both the suits proffered by litigants and those instituted by the king (himself).\n\n26. 26 When the safety of many may be effected by destroying a single offender, his, execution is productive of religious merit (even).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[386:1](sbe3385.htm#fr_1296) XXVII, 1.
