They (the pra _n_ as) are senses, on account of being so designated, with\nthe exception of the best (the mukhya pra _n_ a).\n\nWe have treated of the mukhya pra _n_ a and the other\n\np. 94\n\neleven pra _n_ as in due order.--Now there arises another doubt, viz. whether\nthe other pra _n_ as are functions of the mukhya pra _n_ a or different\nbeings.--The purvapakshin that they are mere functions, on account of\nscriptural statement. For scripture, after having spoken of the chief pra _n_\na and the other pra _n_ as in proximity, declares that those other pra _n_ as\nhave their Self in the chief pra _n_ a, 'Well, let us all assume his form.\nThereupon they all assumed his form' (B _ri_. Up. I, 5, 2l).--Their unity is\nmoreover ascertained from the unity of the term applied to them, viz. pra _n_\na. Otherwise there either would result the objectionable circumstance of one\nword having different senses, or else the word would in some places have to be\ntaken in its primary sense, in others in a derived sense. Hence, as pra _n_ a,\napana, &c. are the five functions of the one chief pra _n_ a, so the eleven\npra _n_ as also which begin with speech are mere functions of the chief pra\n_n_ a.--To this we reply as follows. Speech and so on are beings different\nfrom the chief pra _n_ a, on account of the difference of designation.--Which\nis that difference of designation?--The eleven pra _n_ as remaining if we\nabstract from the best one, i.e. the chief pra _n_ a, are called the sense-\norgans (indriya), as we see them designated in _S_ ruti, 'from him is born\nbreath, mind, and all organs of sense' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3). In this and other\npassages pra _n_ a and the sense-organs are mentioned separately.--But in that\ncase the mind also would have to be excluded from the class of sense-organs,\nlike the pra _n_ a; as we see that like the latter it is separately mentioned\nin the passage, 'The mind and all organs of sense.' True; but in Sm _ri_ ti\neleven sense-organs are mentioned, and on that account the mind must, like the\near, and so on, be comprised in the sense-organs. That the pra _n_ a on the\nother hand is a sense-organ is known neither from Sm _ri_ ti nor _S_ ruti.--\nNow this difference of designation is appropriate only if there is difference\nof being. If there were unity of being it would be contradictory that the pra\n_n_ a although one should sometimes be designated as sense--organ and\nsometimes not. Consequently the other pra _n_ as are different in being from\nthe chief pra _n_ a.--For this conclusion the following Sutra states an\nadditional reason.\n\np. 95\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 18](sbe38072.htm)\n\n"
