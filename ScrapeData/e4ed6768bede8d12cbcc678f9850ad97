But that (Brahman is to be known from Scripture), because it is connected\n(with the Vedanta-texts) as their purport.\n\nThe word \'but\' is meant to rebut the purva-paksha (the prima facie view as\nurged above). That all-knowing, all-powerful Brahman, which is the cause of\nthe origin, subsistence, and dissolution of the world, is known from the\nVedanta-part of Scripture. How? Because in all the Vedanta-texts the sentences\nconstrue in so far as they have for their purport, as they intimate that\nmatter (viz. Brahman). Compare, for instance, \'Being only this was in the\nbeginning, one, without a second\' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 1); \'In the beginning all\nthis was Self, one only\' (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 4, 1, 1); \'This is the Brahman without\ncause and without effect, without anything inside or outside; this Self is\nBrahman perceiving everything\' (B _ri_. Up. II, 5, 19); \'That immortal Brahman\nis before\' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); and similar passages. If the words contained\nin these passages have once been determined to refer to Brahman, and their\npurport is understood thereby, it would be improper to assume them to have a\ndifferent sense; for that would involve the fault of abandoning the direct\nstatements of the text in favour of mere assumptions. Nor can we conclude the\npurport of these passages to be the intimation of the nature of agents,\ndivinities, &c. (connected with acts of religious duty); for there are certain\nscriptural passages which preclude all actions, actors, and fruits, as, for\ninstance, B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 13, \'Then by what should he see whom?\' (which\npassage intimates that there is neither an agent, nor an object of action, nor\nan instrument.) Nor again can Brahman, though it is of the nature of an\naccomplished thing, be the object of perception and the other means of\n\np. 23\n\nknowledge; for the fact of everything having its Self in Brahman cannot be\ngrasped without the aid of the scriptural passage \'That art thou\' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVI, 8, 7). Nor can it rightly be objected that instruction is purportless if\nnot connected with something either to be striven after or shunned; for from\nthe mere comprehension of Brahman\'s Self, which is not something either to be\navoided or endeavoured after, there results cessation of all pain, and thereby\nthe attainment of man\'s highest aim. That passages notifying certain\ndivinities, and so on, stand in subordinate relation to acts of devout\nmeditation mentioned in the same chapters may readily be admitted. But it is\nimpossible that Brahman should stand in an analogous relation to injunctions\nof devout meditation, for if the knowledge of absolute unity has once arisen\nthere exists no longer anything to be desired or avoided, and thereby the\nconception of duality, according to which we distinguish actions, agents, and\nthe like, is destroyed. If the conception of duality is once uprooted by the\nconception of absolute unity, it cannot arise again, and so no longer be the\ncause of Brahman being looked upon as the complementary object of injunctions\nof devotion. Other parts of the Veda may have no authority except in so far as\nthey are connected with injunctions; still it is impossible to impugn on that\nground the authoritativeness of passages conveying the knowledge of the Self;\nfor such passages have their own result. Nor, finally, can the\nauthoritativeness of the Veda be proved by inferential reasoning so that it\nwould be dependent on instances observed elsewhere. From all which it follows\nthat the Veda possesses authority as a means of right knowledge of Brahman.\n\nHere others raise the following objection:--Although the Veda is the means of\ngaining a right knowledge of Brahman, yet it intimates Brahman only as the\nobject of certain injunctions, just as the information which the Veda gives\nabout the sacrificial post, the ahavaniya-fire and other objects not known\nfrom the practice of common life is merely supplementary to certain\ninjunctions 1. Why so?\n\np. 24\n\n[paragraph continues] Because the Veda has the purport of either instigating\nto action or restraining from it. For men fully acquainted with the object of\nthe Veda have made the following declaration, \'The purpose of the Veda is seen\nto be the injunction of actions\' (Bhashya on _G_ aimini Sutra I, 1, 1);\n\'Injunction means passages impelling to action\' (Bh. on _G_ aim. Su. I, 1, 2);\n\'Of this (viz. active religious duty) the knowledge comes from injunction\'\n(part of _G_ aim. Su. I, 1, 5); \'The (words) denoting those (things) are to be\nconnected with (the injunctive verb of the vidhi-passage) whose purport is\naction\' ( _G_ aim. Su. I, 1, 25); \'As action is the purport of the Veda,\nwhatever does not refer to action is purportless\' ( _G_ aim. Su. I, 2, 1).\nTherefore the Veda has a purport in so far only as it rouses the activity of\nman with regard to some actions and restrains it with regard to others; other\npassages (i.e. all those passages which are not directly injunctive) have a\npurport only in so far as they supplement injunctions and prohibitions. Hence\nthe Vedanta-texts also as likewise belonging to the Veda can have a meaning in\nthe same way only. And if their aim is injunction, then just as the agnihotra-\noblation and other rites are enjoined as means for him who is desirous of the\nheavenly world, so the knowledge of Brahman is enjoined as a means for him who\nis desirous of immortality.--But--somebody might object--it has been declared\nthat there is a difference in the character of the objects enquired into, the\nobject of enquiry in the karma-ka _nd_ a (that part of the Veda which treats\nof active religious duty) being something to be accomplished, viz. duty, while\nhere the object is the already existent absolutely accomplished Brahman. From\nthis it follows that the fruit of the knowledge of Brahman must be of a\ndifferent nature from the fruit of the knowledge of duty which depends on the\nperformance of actions 1.--We reply that it must not be such because the\n\np. 25\n\n[paragraph continues] Vedanta-texts give information about Brahman only in so\nfar as it is connected with injunctions of actions. We meet with injunctions\nof the following kind, \'Verily the Self is to be seen\' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 5);\n\'The Self which is free from sin that it is which we must search out, that it\nis which we must try to understand\' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7, 1); \'Let a man\nworship him as Self\' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 7); \'Let a man worship the Self only\nas his true state\' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 15); \'He who knows Brahman becomes\nBrahman\' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9). These injunctions rouse in us the desire to know\nwhat that Brahman is. It, therefore, is the task of the Vedanta-texts to set\nforth Brahman\'s nature, and they perform that task by teaching us that Brahman\nis eternal, all-knowing, absolutely self-sufficient, ever pure, intelligent\nand free, pure knowledge, absolute bliss. From the devout meditation on this\nBrahman there results as its fruit, final release, which, although not to be\ndiscerned in the ordinary way, is discerned by means of the _s_ astra. If, on\nthe other hand, the Vedanta-texts were considered to have no reference to\ninjunctions of actions, but to contain statements about mere (accomplished)\nthings, just as if one were saying \'the earth comprises seven dvipas,\' \'that\nking is marching on,\' they would be purportless, because then they could not\npossibly be connected with something to be shunned or endeavoured after.--\nPerhaps it will here be objected that sometimes a mere statement about\nexistent things has a purpose, as, for instance, the affirmation, \'This is a\nrope, not a snake,\' serves the purpose of removing the fear engendered by an\nerroneous opinion, and that so likewise the Vedanta-passages making statements\nabout the non-transmigrating Self, have a purport of their own (without\nreference to any action), viz. in so far as they remove the erroneous opinion\nof the Self being liable to transmigration.--We reply that this might\n\np. 26\n\nbe so if just as the mere hearing of the true nature of the rope dispels the\nfear caused by the imagined snake, so the mere hearing of the true nature of\nBrahman would dispel the erroneous notion of one\'s being subject to\ntransmigration. But this is not the case; for we observe that even men to whom\nthe true nature of Brahman has been stated continue to be affected by\npleasure, pain, and the other qualities attaching to the transmigratory\ncondition. Moreover, we see from the passage, _Bri_. Up. II, 4, 5, \'The Self\nis to be heard, to be considered, to be reflected upon, that consideration and\nreflection have to follow the mere hearing. From all this it results that the\nsastra can be admitted as a means of knowing Brahman in so far only as the\nlatter is connected with injunctions.\n\nTo all this, we, the Vedantins, make the following reply:--The preceding\nreasoning is not valid, on account of the different nature of the fruits of\nactions on the one side, and of the knowledge of Brahman on the other side.\nThe enquiry into those actions, whether of body, speech, or mind, which are\nknown from--Sruti and Sm _ri_ ti, and are comprised under the name \'religious\nduty\' (dharma), is carried on in the _G_ aimini Sutra, which begins with the\nwords \'then therefore the enquiry into duty;\' the opposite of duty also\n(adharma), such as doing harm, &c., which is defined in the prohibitory\ninjunctions, forms an object of enquiry to the end that it may be avoided. The\nfruits of duty, which is good, and its opposite, which is evil, both of which\nare defined by original Vedic statements, are generally known to be sensible\npleasure and pain, which make themselves felt to body, speech, and mind only,\nare produced by the contact of the organs of sense with the objects, and\naffect all animate beings from Brahman down to a tuft of grass. Scripture,\nagreeing with observation, states that there are differences in the degree of\npleasure of all embodied creatures from men upward to Brahman. From those\ndifferences it is inferred that there are differences in the degrees of the\nmerit acquired by actions in accordance with religious duty; therefrom again\nare inferred differences in degree between those qualified to perform\n\np. 27\n\nacts of religious duty. Those latter differences are moreover known to be\naffected by the desire of certain results (which entitles the man so desirous\nto perform certain religious acts), worldly possessions, and the like. It is\nfurther known from Scripture that those only who perform sacrifices proceed,\nin consequence of the pre-eminence of their knowledge and meditation, on the\nnorthern path (of the sun; _Kh_. Up. V, 10, 1), while mere minor offerings,\nworks of public utility and alms, only lead through smoke and the other stages\nto the southern path. And that there also (viz. in the moon which is finally\nreached by those who have passed along the southern path) there are degrees of\npleasure and the means of pleasure is understood from the passage \'Having\ndwelt there till their works are consumed.\' Analogously it is understood that\nthe different degrees of pleasure which are enjoyed by the embodied creatures,\nfrom man downward to the inmates of hell and to immovable things, are the mere\neffects of religious merit as defined in Vedic injunctions. On the other hand,\nfrom the different degrees of pain endured by higher and lower embodied\ncreatures, there is inferred difference of degree in its cause, viz. religious\ndemerit as defined in the prohibitory injunctions, and in its agents. This\ndifference in the degree of pain and pleasure, which has for its antecedent\nembodied existence, and for its cause the difference of degree of merit and\ndemerit of animated beings, liable to faults such as ignorance and the like,\nis well known--from _S_ ruti, Sm _ri_ ti, and reasoning-to be non-eternal, of\na fleeting, changing nature (sa _m_ sara). The following text, for instance,\n\'As long as he is in the body he cannot get free from pleasure and pain\' (\n_Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, i), refers to the sa _m_ sara-state as described above.\nFrom the following passage, on the other hand, \'When he is free from the body\nthen neither pleasure nor pain touches him,\' which denies the touch of pain or\npleasure, we learn that the unembodied state called \'final release\' (moksha)\nis declared not to be the effect of religious merit as defined by Vedic\ninjunctions. For if it were the effect of merit it would not be denied that it\nis subject to pain and pleasure. Should it be said\n\np. 28\n\nthat the very circumstance of its being an unembodied state is the effect of\nmerit, we reply that that cannot be, since Scripture declares that state to be\nnaturally and originally an unembodied one. \'The wise who knows the Self as\nbodiless within the bodies, as unchanging among changing things, as great and\nomnipresent does never grieve\' (Ka. Up. II, 22); \'He is without breath,\nwithout mind, pure\' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 2); \'That person is not attached to\nanything\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 15) 1. All which passages establish the fact\nthat so-called release differs from all the fruits of action, and is an\neternally and essentially disembodied state. Among eternal things, some indeed\nmay be \'eternal, although changing\' (pari _n_ aminitya), viz. those, the idea\nof whose identity is not destroyed, although they may undergo changes; such,\nfor instance, are earth and the other elements in the opinion of those who\nmaintain the eternity of the world, or the three gu _n_ as in the opinion of\nthe Sa _n_ khyas. But this (moksha) is eternal in the true sense, i.e. eternal\nwithout undergoing any changes (ku _ta_ sthanitya), omnipresent as ether, free\nfrom all modifications, absolutely self-sufficient, not composed of parts, of\nself-luminous nature. That bodiless entity in fact, to which merit and demerit\nwith their consequences and threefold time do not apply, is called release; a\ndefinition agreeing with scriptural passages, such as the following:\n\'Different from merit and demerit, different from effect and cause, different\nfrom past and future\' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 14). It 2 (i.e. moksha) is, therefore,\nthe same as Brahman in the enquiry into which we are at present engaged. If\nBrahman were represented as supplementary to certain actions, and release\n\np. 29\n\nwere assumed to be the effect of those actions, it would be non-eternal, and\nwould have to be considered merely as something holding a pre-eminent position\namong the described non-eternal fruits of actions with their various degrees.\nBut that release is something eternal is acknowledged by whoever admits it at\nall, and the teaching concerning Brahman can therefore not be merely\nsupplementary to actions.\n\nThere are, moreover, a number of scriptural passages which declare release to\nfollow immediately on the cognition of Brahman, and which thus preclude the\npossibility of an effect intervening between the two; for instance, \'He who\nknows Brahman becomes Brahman\' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9); \'All his works perish when\nHe has been beheld, who is the higher and the lower\' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8); \'He\nwho knows the bliss of Brahman fears nothing\' (Taitt. Up. II, 9); \'O _G_\nanaka, you have indeed reached fearlessness\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 2, 4); \'That\nBrahman knew its Self only, saying, I am Brahman. From it all this sprang\' (B\n_ri_. Up. I, 4, 10); \'What sorrow, what trouble can there be to him who\nbeholds that unity?\' (\xc3\x8e _s_. Up. 7.) We must likewise quote the passage,--B\n_ri_. Up. I, 4, 10, (\'Seeing this the _Ri_ shi Vamadeva understood: I was\nManu, I was the sun,\') in order to exclude the idea of any action taking place\nbetween one\'s seeing Brahman and becoming one with the universal Self; for\nthat passage is analogous to the following one, \'standing he sings,\' from\nwhich we understand that no action due to the same agent intervenes between\nthe standing and the singing. Other scriptural passages show that the removal\nof the obstacles which lie in the way of release is the only fruit of the\nknowledge of Brahman; so, for instance, \'You indeed are our father, you who\ncarry us from our ignorance to the other shore\' (Pr. Up. VI, 8); \'I have heard\nfrom men like you that he who knows the Self overcomes grief. I am in grief.\nDo, Sir, help me over this grief of mine\' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 1,3); \'To him after\nhis faults had been rubbed out, the venerable Sanatkumara showed the other\nside of darkness\' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 26, 2). The same is the purport of the\nSutra, supported by arguments, of (Gautama) \xc3\x82 _k_ arya, \'Final release\n\np. 30\n\nresults from the successive removal of wrong knowledge, faults, activity,\nbirth, pain, the removal of each later member of the series depending on the\nremoval of the preceding member\' (Nyay. Su. I, 1, 2); and wrong knowledge\nitself is removed by the knowledge of one\'s Self being one with the Self of\nBrahman.\n\nNor is this knowledge of the Self being one with Brahman a mere (fanciful)\ncombination 1, as is made use of, for instance, in the following passage, \'For\nthe mind is endless, and the Vi _s_ vedevas are endless, and he thereby gains\nthe endless world\' (B _ri_. Up. III, 1, 9) 2; nor is it an (in reality\nunfounded) ascription (superimposition) 3, as in the passages, \'Let him\nmeditate on mind as Brahman,\' and \'\xc3\x82ditya is Brahman, this is the doctrine\' (\n_Kh_. Up. III, 18, 1; 19, 1), where the contemplation as Brahman is\nsuperimposed on the mind, \xc3\x82ditya and so on; nor, again, is it (a figurative\nconception of identity) founded on the connection (of the things viewed as\nidentical) with some special activity, as in the passage, \'Air is indeed the\nabsorber; breath is indeed the absorber 4\' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 3, 1; 3); nor is it\na mere (ceremonial) purification of (the Self constituting a subordinate\nmember) of an action (viz. the action of seeing, &c., Brahman), in the same\nway as, for instance, the act of looking at the sacrificial\n\np. 31\n\nbutter 1. For if the knowledge of the identity of the Self and Brahman were\nunderstood in the way of combination and the like, violence would be done\nthereby to the connection of the words whose object, in certain passages, it\nclearly is to intimate the fact of Brahman and the Self being really\nidentical; so, for instance, in the following passages, \'That art thou\' (\n_Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 7); \'I am Brahman\' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10); \'This Self is\nBrahman\' (B _ri_. Up. II, 5, 19). And other texts which declare that the fruit\nof the cognition of Brahman is the cessation of Ignorance would be\ncontradicted thereby; so, for instance, \'The fetter of the heart is broken,\nall doubts are solved\' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8). Nor, finally, would it be possible,\nin that case, satisfactorily to explain the passages which speak of the\nindividual Self becoming Brahman: such as \'He who knows Brahman becomes\nBrahman\' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9). Hence the knowledge of the unity of Brahman and\nthe Self cannot be of the nature of figurative combination and the like. The\nknowledge of Brahman does, therefore, not depend on the active energy of man,\nbut is analogous to the knowledge of those things which are the objects of\nperception, inference, and so on, and thus depends on the object of knowledge\nonly. Of such a Brahman or its knowledge it is impossible to establish, by\nreasoning, any connection with actions.\n\nNor, again, can we connect Brahman with acts by representing it as the object\nof the action of knowing. For that it is not such is expressly declared in two\npassages, viz. \'It is different from the known and again above (i.e. different\nfrom) the unknown\' (Ken. Up. I, 3); and \'How should he know him by whom he\nknows all this?\' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 13.) In the same way Brahman is expressly\ndeclared not to be the object of the act of devout meditation, viz. in the\nsecond half of the verse, Ken. Up. I, 5, whose first half\n\np. 32\n\ndeclares it not to be an object (of speech, mind, and so on), \'That which is\nnot proclaimed by speech, by which speech is proclaimed, that only know to be\nBrahman, not that on which people devoutly meditate as this.\' If it should be\nobjected that if Brahman is not an object (of speech, mind, &c.) the sastra\ncan impossibly be its source, we refute this objection by the remark that the\naim of the sastra is to discard all distinctions fictitiously created by\nNescience. The _s_ astra\'s purport is not to represent Brahman definitely as\nthis or that object, its purpose is rather to show that Brahman as the eternal\nsubject (pratyagatman, the inward Self) is never an object, and thereby to\nremove the distinction of objects known, knowers, acts of knowledge, &c.,\nwhich is fictitiously created by Nescience. Accordingly the sastra says, \'By\nwhom it is not thought by him it is thought, by whom it is thought he does not\nknow it; unknown by those who know it, it is known by those who do not know\nit\' (Ken. Up. II, 3}; and \'Thou couldst not see the seer of sight, thou\ncouldst not hear the hearer of hearing, nor perceive the perceiver of\nperception, nor know the knower of knowledge\' (B _ri_. Up. III, 4, 2). As\nthereby (i.e. by the knowledge derived from the sastra) the imagination of the\ntransitoriness of Release which is due to Nescience is discarded, and Release\nis shown to be of the nature of the eternally free Self, it cannot be charged\nwith the imperfection of non-eternality. Those, on the other hand, who\nconsider Release to be something to be effected properly maintain that it\ndepends on the action of mind, speech, or body. So, likewise, those who\nconsider it to be a mere modification. Non-eternality of Release is the\ncertain consequence of these two opinions; for we observe in common life that\nthings which are modifications, such as sour milk and the like, and things\nwhich are effects, such as jars, &c., are non-eternal. Nor, again, can it be\nsaid that there is a dependance on action in consequence of (Brahman or\nRelease) being something which is to be obtained 1; for as Brahman constitutes\na person\'s Self it is\n\np. 33\n\nnot something to be attained by that person. And even if Brahman were\naltogether different from a person\'s Self still it would not be something to\nbe obtained; for as it is omnipresent it is part of its nature that it is ever\npresent to every one, just as the (all-pervading) ether is. Nor, again, can it\nbe maintained that Release is something to be ceremonially purified, and as\nsuch depends on an activity. For ceremonial purification (sa _m_ skara)\nresults either from the accretion of some excellence or from the removal of\nsome blemish. The former alternative does not apply to Release as it is of the\nnature of Brahman, to which no excellence can be added; nor, again, does the\nlatter alternative apply, since Release is of the nature of Brahman, which is\neternally pure.--But, it might be said, Release might be a quality of the Self\nwhich is merely hidden and becomes manifest on the Self being purified by some\naction; just as the quality of clearness becomes manifest in a mirror when the\nmirror is cleaned by means of the action of rubbing.--This objection is\ninvalid, we reply, because the Self cannot be the abode of any action. For an\naction cannot exist without modifying that in which it abides. But if the Self\nwere modified by an action its non-eternality would result therefrom, and\ntexts such as the following, \'unchangeable he is called,\' would thus be\nstultified; an altogether unacceptable result. Hence it is impossible to\nassume that any action should abide in the Self. On the other hand, the Self\ncannot be purified by actions abiding in something else as it stands in no\nrelation to that extraneous something. Nor will it avail to point out (as a\nquasi-analogous case) that the embodied Self (dehin, the individual soul) is\npurified by certain ritual actions which abide in the body, such as bathing,\nrinsing one\'s mouth, wearing the sacrificial thread, and the like. For what is\npurified by those actions is that Self merely which is joined to the body,\ni.e. the Self in so far as it is under the power of Nescience. For it is a\nmatter of perception\n\np. 34\n\nthat bathing and similar actions stand in the relation of inherence to the\nbody, and it is therefore only proper to conclude that by such actions only\nthat something is purified which is joined to the body. If a person thinks \'I\nam free from disease,\' he predicates health of that entity only which is\nconnected with and mistakenly identifies itself with the harmonious condition\nof matter (i.e. the body) resulting from appropriate medical treatment applied\nto the body (i.e. the \'I\' constituting the subject of predication is only the\nindividual embodied Self). Analogously that I which predicates of itself, that\nit is purified by bathing and the like, is only the individual soul joined to\nthe body. For it is only this latter principle of egoity (aha _m_ kart _ri_ ),\nthe object of the notion of the ego and the agent in all cognition, which\naccomplishes all actions and enjoys their results. Thus the mantras also\ndeclare, \'One of them eats the sweet fruit, the other looks on without eating\'\n(Mu. Up. III, 1, 1); and \'When he is in union with the body, the senses, and\nthe mind, then wise people call him the Enjoyer\' (Ka. Up. III, 1, 4). Of\nBrahman, on the other hand, the two following passages declare that it is\nincapable of receiving any accretion and eternally pure, \'He is the one God,\nhidden in all beings, all-pervading, the Self within all beings, watching over\nall works, dwelling in all beings, the witness, the perceiver, the only one;\nfree from qualities\' ( _S_ v. Up. VI, 11); and \'He pervaded all, bright,\nincorporeal, scatheless, without muscles, pure, untouched by evil\' (\xc3\x8e _s_. Up.\n8). But Release is nothing but being Brahman. Therefore Release is not\nsomething to be purified. And as nobody is able to show any other way in which\nRelease could be connected with action, it is impossible that it should stand\nin any, even the slightest, relation to any action, excepting knowledge.\n\nBut, it will be said here, knowledge itself is an activity of the mind. By no\nmeans, we reply; since the two are of different nature. An action is that\nwhich is enjoined as being independent of the nature of existing things and\ndependent on the energy of some person\'s mind; compare, for instance, the\nfollowing passages, \'To whichever divinity the\n\np. 35\n\noffering is made on that one let him meditate when about to say vasha _t_ \'\n(Ait. Brahm. III, 8, 1); and \'Let him meditate in his mind on the sandhya.\'\nMeditation and reflection are indeed mental, but as they depend on the\n(meditating, &c.) person they may either be performed or not be performed or\nmodified. Knowledge, on the other hand, is the result of the different means\nof (right) knowledge, and those have for their objects existing things;\nknowledge can therefore not be either made or not made or modified, but\ndepends entirely on existing things, and not either on Vedic statements or on\nthe mind of man. Although mental it thus widely differs from meditation and\nthe like.\n\nThe meditation, for instance, on man and woman as fire, which is founded on\n_Kh._ Up. V, 7, 1; 8, 1, \'The fire is man, O Gautama; the fire is woman, O\nGautama,\' is on account of its being the result of a Vedic statement, merely\nan action and dependent on man; that conception of fire, on the other hand,\nwhich refers to the well-known (real) fire, is neither dependent on Vedic\nstatements nor on man, but only on a real thing which is an object of\nperception; it is therefore knowledge and not an action. The same remark\napplies to all things which are the objects of the different means of right\nknowledge. This being thus that knowledge also which has the existent Brahman\nfor its object is not dependent on Vedic injunction. Hence, although\nimperative and similar forms referring to the knowledge of Brahman are found\nin the Vedic texts, yet they are ineffective because they refer to something\nwhich cannot be enjoined, just as the edge of a razor becomes blunt when it is\napplied to a stone. For they have for their object something which can neither\nbe endeavoured after nor avoided.--But what then, it will be asked, is the\npurport of those sentences which, at any rate, have the appearance of\ninjunctions; such as, \'The Self is to be seen, to be heard about?\'--They have\nthe purport, we reply, of diverting (men) from the objects of natural\nactivity. For when a man acts intent on external things, and only anxious to\nattain the objects of his desire and to eschew the objects of his aversion,\nand does not thereby reach the highest aim of man although desirous of\nattaining it; such\n\np. 36\n\ntexts as the one quoted divert him from the objects of natural activity and\nturn the stream of his thoughts on the inward (the highest) Self. That for him\nwho is engaged in the enquiry into the Self, the true nature of the Self is\nnothing either to be endeavoured after or to be avoided, we learn from texts\nsuch as the following: \'This everything, all is that Self\' (B _ri_ , Up. II,\n4, 6); \'But when the Self only is all this, how should he see another, how\nshould he know another, how should he know the knower?\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5,\n15); \'This Self is Brahman\' (B _ri_. Up. II, 5, 19). That the knowledge of\nBrahman refers to something which is not a thing to be done, and therefore is\nnot concerned either with the pursuit or the avoidance of any object, is the\nvery thing we admit; for just that constitutes our glory, that as soon as we\ncomprehend Brahman, all our duties come to an end and all our work is over.\nThus _S_ ruti says, \'If a man understands the Self, saying, "I am he," what\ncould he wish or desire that he should pine after the body?\' (B _ri_. Up. IV,\n4, 12.) And similarly Sm _ri_ ti declares, \'Having understood this the\nunderstanding man has done with all work, O Bharata\' (Bha. Gita XV, 20).\nTherefore Brahman is not represented as the object of injunctions.\n\nWe now proceed to consider the doctrine of those who maintain that there is no\npart of the Veda which has the purport of making statements about mere\nexistent things, and is not either an injunction or a prohibition, or\nsupplementary to either. This opinion is erroneous, because the soul\n(purusha), which is the subject of the Upanishads, does not constitute a\ncomplement to anything else. Of that soul which is to be comprehended from the\nUpanishads only, which is non-transmigratory, Brahman, different in nature\nfrom the four classes of substances 1, which forms a topic of its own and is\nnot a complement to anything else; of that\n\np. 37\n\nsoul it is impossible to say that it is not or is not apprehended; for the\npassage, \'That Self is to be described by No, no!\' (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 26)\ndesignates it as the Self, and that the Self is cannot be denied. The possible\nobjection that there is no reason to maintain that the soul is known from the\nUpanishads only, since it is the object of self-consciousness, is refuted by\nthe fact that the soul of which the Upanishads treat is merely the witness of\nthat (i.e. of the object of self-consciousness, viz. the _g_ ivatman). For\nneither from that part of the Veda which enjoins works nor from reasoning,\nanybody apprehends that soul which, different from the agent that is the\nobject of self-consciousness, merely witnesses it; which is permanent in all\n(transitory) beings; uniform; one; eternally unchanging; the Self of\neverything. Hence it can neither be denied nor be represented as the mere\ncomplement of injunctions; for of that very person who might deny it it is the\nSelf. And as it is the Self of all, it can neither be striven after nor\navoided. All perishable things indeed perish, because they are mere\nmodifications, up to (i.e. exclusive of) the soul. But the soul is\nimperishable 1, as there is no cause why it should perish; and eternally\nunchanging, as there is no cause for its undergoing any modification; hence it\nis in its essence eternally pure and free. And from passages, such as \'Beyond\nthe soul there is nothing; this is the goal, the highest road\' (Ka. Up. I, 3,\n11), and \'That soul, taught in the Upanishads, I ask thee\' (B _ri_. Up. III,\n9, 26), it appears that the attribute of resting on the Upanishads is properly\ngiven to the soul, as it constitutes their chief topic. To say, therefore,\nthat there is no portion of the Veda referring to existing things, is a mere\nbold assertion.\n\nWith regard to the quotations made of the views of men acquainted with the\npurport of the _S_ astra (who alone were stated to have declared that the Veda\ntreats of actions) it is to be understood that they, having to do with the\nenquiry into duty, refer to that part of the _S_ astra which consists of\n\np. 38\n\ninjunctions and prohibitions. With regard to the other passage quoted (\'as\naction is the purport of the Veda, whatever does not refer to action is\npurportless\') we remark that if that passage were taken in an absolutely\nstrict sense (when it would mean that only those words which denote action\nhave a meaning), it would follow that all information about existent things is\nmeaningless 1. If, on the other hand, the Veda--in addition to the injunctions\nof activity and cessation of activity--does give information about existent\nthings as being subservient to some action to be accomplished, why then should\nit not give information also about the existent eternally unchangeable Self?\nFor an existent thing, about which information is given, does not become an\nact (through being stated to be subservient to an act).--But, it will be said,\nalthough existent things are not acts, yet, as they are instrumental to\naction, the information given about such things is merely subservient to\naction.--This, we reply, does not matter; for although the information may be\nsubservient to action, the things themselves about which information is given\nare already intimated thereby as things which have the power of bringing about\ncertain actions. Their final end (prayo _g_ ana) indeed may be subserviency to\nsome action, but thereby they do not cease to be, in the information given\nabout them, intimated in themselves.--Well, and if they are thus intimated,\nwhat is gained thereby for your purpose 2? We reply that the information about\nthe Self, which is an existing thing not comprehended from other sources, is\nof the same nature (as the information about other existent things); for by\nthe comprehension of the Self a stop is put to all false knowledge, which is\nthe cause of transmigration, and thus a\n\np. 39\n\npurpose is established which renders the passages relative to Brahman equal to\nthose passages which give information about things instrumental to actions.\nMoreover, there are found (even in that part of the Veda which treats of\nactions) such passages as \'a Brahma _n_ a is not to be killed,\' which teach\nabstinence from certain actions. Now abstinence from action is neither action\nnor instrumental to action. If, therefore, the tenet that all those passages\nwhich do not express action are devoid of purport were insisted on, it would\nfollow that all such passages as the one quoted, which teach abstinence from\naction, are devoid of purport--a consequence which is of course unacceptable.\nNor, again, can the connexion in which the word \'not\' stands with the action\nexpressed by the verb \'is to be killed\'--which action is naturally established\n1\\--be used as a reason for assuming that \'not\' denotes an action non-\nestablished elsewhere 2, different from the state of mere passivity implied in\nthe abstinence from the act of killing. For the peculiar function of the\nparticle \'not\' is to intimate the idea of the non-existence of that with which\nit is connected, and the conception of the non-existence (of something to be\ndone) is the cause of the state of passivity. (Nor can it be objected that, as\nsoon as that momentary idea has passed away, the state of passivity will again\nmake room for activity; for) that idea itself passes away (only after having\ncompletely destroyed the natural impulse prompting to the murder of a Brahma\n_n_ a, &c., just as a fire is extinguished only after having completely\nconsumed its fuel. Hence we are of opinion that the aim of prohibitory\npassages, such as \'a Brahma _n_ a is not to be killed, \'is a merely passive\nstate, consisting in the abstinence from some possible action; excepting some\nspecial cases, such as the so-called Pra _g_ apati-vow, &c. 3 Hence the charge\nof want of purpose is to be\n\np. 40\n\nconsidered as referring (not to the Vedanta-passages, but only) to such\nstatements about existent things as are of the nature of legends and the like,\nand do not serve any purpose of man.\n\nThe allegation that a mere statement about an actually existent thing not\nconnected with an injunction of something to be done, is purposeless (as, for\ninstance, the statement that the earth contains seven dvipas) has already been\nrefuted on the ground that a purpose is seen to exist in some such statements,\nas, for instance, \'this is not a snake, but a rope.\'--But how about the\nobjection raised above that the information about Brahman cannot be held to\nhave a purpose in the same way as the statement about a rope has one, because\na man even after having heard about Brahman continues to belong to this\ntransmigratory\n\np. 41\n\nworld?--We reply as follows: It is impossible to show that a man who has once\nunderstood Brahman to be the Self, belongs to the transmigratory world in the\nsame sense as he did before, because that would be contrary to the fact of his\nbeing Brahman. For we indeed observe that a person who imagines the body, and\nso on, to constitute the Self, is subject to fear and pain, but we have no\nright to assume that the same person after having, by means of the Veda,\ncomprehended Brahman to be the Self, and thus having got over his former\nimaginings, will still in the same manner be subject to pain and fear whose\ncause is wrong knowledge. In the same way we see that a rich householder,\npuffed up by the conceit of his wealth, is grieved when his possessions are\ntaken from him; but we do not see that the loss of his wealth equally grieves\nhim after he has once retired from the world and put off the conceit of his\nriches. And, again, we see that a person possessing a pair of beautiful\nearrings derives pleasure from the proud conceit of ownership; but after he\nhas lost the earrings and the conceit established thereon, the pleasure\nderived from them vanishes. Thus Sruti also declares, \'When he is free from\nthe body, then neither pleasure nor pain touches him\' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12,\n1). If it should be objected that the condition of being free from the body\nfollows on death only, we demur, since the cause of man being joined to the\nbody is wrong knowledge. For it is not possible to establish the state of\nembodiedness upon anything else but wrong knowledge. And that the state of\ndisembodiedness is eternal on account of its not having actions for its cause,\nwe have already explained. The objection again, that embodiedness is caused by\nthe merit and demerit effected by the Self (and therefore real), we refute by\nremarking that as the (reality of the) conjunction of the Self with the body\nis itself not established, the circumstance of merit and demerit being due to\nthe action of the Self is likewise not established; for (if we should try to\nget over this difficulty by representing the Self\'s embodiedness as caused by\nmerit and demerit) we should commit the logical fault of making embodiedness\ndependent on merit and demerit,\n\np. 42\n\nand again merit and demerit on embodiedness. And the assumption of an endless\nretrogressive chain (of embodied states and merit and demerit) would be no\nbetter than a chain of blind men (who are unable to lead one another).\nMoreover, the Self can impossibly become an agent, as it cannot enter into\nintimate relation to actions. If it should be said that the Self may be\nconsidered as an agent in the same way as kings and other great people are\n(who without acting themselves make others act) by their mere presence, we\ndeny the appositeness of this instance; for kings may become agents through\ntheir relation to servants whom they procure by giving them wages, &c., while\nit is impossible to imagine anything, analogous to money, which could be the\ncause of a connexion between the Self as lord and the body, and so on (as\nservants). Wrong imagination, on the other hand, (of the individual Self,\nconsidering itself to be joined to the body,) is a manifest reason of the\nconnexion of the two (which is not based on any assumption). This explains\nalso in how far the Self can be considered as the agent in sacrifices and\nsimilar acts 1. Here it is objected that the Self\'s imagination as to the\nbody, and so on, belonging to itself is not false, but is to be understood in\na derived (figurative) sense. This objection we invalidate by the remark that\nthe distinction of derived and primary senses of words is known to be\napplicable only where an actual difference of things is known to exist. We\nare, for instance, acquainted with a certain species of animals having a mane,\nand so on, which is the exclusive primary object of the idea and word \'lion,\'\nand we are likewise acquainted with persons possessing in an eminent degree\ncertain leonine qualities, such as fierceness, courage, &c.; here, a well\nsettled difference of objects existing, the idea and the name \'lion\' are\napplied to those persons in a derived or figurative sense. In those cases,\nhowever, where the difference of the objects is not well established, the\ntransfer of the conception and\n\np. 43\n\nname of the one to the other is not figurative, but simply founded on error.\nSuch is, for instance, the case of a man who at the time of twilight does not\ndiscern that the object before him is a post, and applies to it the conception\nand designation of a man; such is likewise the case of the conception and\ndesignation of silver being applied to a shell of mother-of-pearl somehow\nmistaken for silver. How then can it be maintained that the application of the\nword and the conception of the Ego to the body, &c., which application is due\nto the non-discrimination of the Self and the Not-Self, is figurative (rather\nthan simply false)? considering that even learned men who know the difference\nof the Self and the Not-Self confound the words and ideas just as common\nshepherds and goatherds do.\n\nAs therefore the application of the conception of the Ego to the body on the\npart of those who affirm the existence of a Self different from the body is\nsimply false, not figurative, it follows that the embodiedness of the Self is\n(not real but) caused by wrong conception, and hence that the person who has\nreached true knowledge is free from his body even while still alive. The same\nis declared in the _S_ ruti passages concerning him who knows Brahman: \'And as\nthe slough of a snake lies on an ant-hill, dead and cast away, thus lies this\nbody; but that disembodied immortal spirit is Brahman only, is only light\' (B\n_ri_. Up. IV, 4, 7); and \'With eyes he is without eyes as it were, with ears\nwithout ears as it were, with speech without speech as it were, with a mind\nwithout mind as it were, with vital airs without vital airs as it were.\' Sm\n_ri_ ti also, in the passage where the characteristic marks are enumerated of\none whose mind is steady (Bha. Gita II, 54), declares that he who knows is no\nlonger connected with action of any kind. Therefore the man who has once\ncomprehended Brahman to be the Self, does not belong to this transmigratory\nworld as he did before. He, on the other hand, who still belongs to this\ntransmigratory world as before, has not comprehended Brahman to be the Self.\nThus there remain no unsolved contradictions.\n\nWith reference again to the assertion that Brahman is not\n\np. 44\n\nfully determined in its own nature, but stands in a complementary relation to\ninjunctions, because the hearing about Brahman is to be followed by\nconsideration and reflection, we remark that consideration and reflection are\nthemselves merely subservient to the comprehension of Brahman. If Brahman,\nafter having been comprehended, stood in a subordinate relation to some\ninjunctions, it might be said to be merely supplementary. But this is not the\ncase, since consideration and reflection no less than hearing are subservient\nto comprehension. It follows that the _S_ astra cannot be the means of knowing\nBrahman only in so far as it is connected with injunctions, and the doctrine\nthat on account of the uniform meaning of the Vedanta-texts, an independent\nBrahman is to be admitted, is thereby fully established. Hence there is room\nfor beginning the new _S_ astra indicated in the first Sutra, \'Then therefore\nthe enquiry into Brahman.\' If, on the other hand, the Vedanta-texts were\nconnected with injunctions, a new _S_ astra would either not be begun at all,\nsince the _S_ astra concerned with injunctions has already been introduced by\nmeans of the first Sutra of the Purva Mima _m_ sa, \'Then therefore the enquiry\ninto duty;\' or if it were begun it would be introduced as follows: \'Then\ntherefore the enquiry into the remaining duties;\' just as a new portion of the\nPurva Mima _m_ sa Sutras is introduced with the words, \'Then therefore the\nenquiry into what subserves the purpose of the sacrifice, and what subserves\nthe purpose of man\' (Pu. Mi. Su. IV, 1, 1). But as the comprehension of the\nunity of Brahman and the Self has not been propounded (in the previous _S_\nastra), it is quite appropriate that a new _S_ astra, whose subject is\nBrahman, should be entered upon. Hence all injunctions and all other means of\nknowledge end with the cognition expressed in the words, \'I am Brahman;\' for\nas soon as there supervenes the comprehension of the non-dual Self, which is\nnot either something to be eschewed or something to be appropriated, all\nobjects and knowing agents vanish, and hence there can no longer be means of\nproof. In accordance with this, they (i.e. men knowing Brahman) have made the\nfollowing declaration:--\n\np. 45\n\n\'When there has arisen (in a man\'s mind) the knowledge, "I am that which is,\nBrahman is my Self," and when, owing to the sublation of the conceptions of\nbody, relatives, and the like, the (imagination of) the figurative and the\nfalse Self has come to an end 1; how should then the effect 2 (of that wrong\nimagination) exist any longer? As long as the knowledge of the Self, which\nScripture tells us to search after, has not arisen, so long the Self is\nknowing subject; but that same subject is that which is searched after, viz.\n(the highest Self) free from all evil and blemish. Just as the idea of the\nSelf being the body is assumed as valid (in ordinary life), so all the\nordinary sources of knowledge (perception and the like) are valid only until\nthe one Self is ascertained.\'\n\n(Herewith the section comprising the four Sutras is finished 3.)\n\nSo far it has been declared that the Vedanta-passages, whose purport is the\ncomprehension of Brahman being the Self, and which have their object therein,\nrefer exclusively to Brahman without any reference to actions. And it has\nfurther been shown that Brahman is the omniscient omnipotent cause of the\norigin, subsistence, and dissolution of the world. But now the Sa _n_ khyas\nand others being of opinion that an existent substance is to be known through\nother means of proof (not through the Veda) infer different causes, such as\nthe pradhana and the like, and thereupon interpret the Vedanta-passages as\nreferring to the latter. All the Vedanta-passages, they maintain, which treat\nof the creation of the world distinctly point out that the cause (of the\nworld) has to be concluded from the effect by inference; and the cause which\nis to be inferred is the connexion of the pradhana with the souls (purusha).\nThe followers of Ka _n_ ada again infer from the very same\n\np. 46\n\npassages that the Lord is the efficient cause of the world while the atoms are\nits material cause. And thus other argumentators also taking their stand on\npassages apparently favouring their views and on fallacious arguments raise\nvarious objections. For this reason the teacher (Vyasa)--thoroughly acquainted\nas he is with words, passages, and means of proof--proceeds to state as prima\nfacie views, and afterwards to refute, all those opinions founded on deceptive\npassages and fallacious arguments. Thereby he at the same time proves\nindirectly that what the Vedanta-texts aim at is the comprehension of Brahman.\n\nThe Sa _n_ khyas who opine that the non-intelligent pradhana consisting of\nthree constituent elements (gu _n_ a) is the cause of the world argue as\nfollows. The Vedanta-passages which you have declared to intimate that the\nall-knowing all-powerful Brahman is the cause of the world can be consistently\ninterpreted also on the doctrine of the pradhana being the general cause.\nOmnipotence (more literally: the possession of all powers) can be ascribed to\nthe pradhana in so far as it has all its effects for its objects. All-\nknowingness also can be ascribed to it, viz. in the following manner. What you\nthink to be knowledge is in reality an attribute of the gu _n_ a of Goodness\n1, according to the Sm _ri_ ti passage \'from Goodness springs knowledge\' (Bha.\nGita XIV, 17). By means of this attribute of Goodness, viz. knowledge, certain\nmen endowed with organs which are effects (of the pradhana) are known as all-\nknowing Yogins; for omniscience is acknowledged to be connected with the very\nhighest degree of \'Goodness.\' Now to the soul (purusha) which is isolated,\ndestitute of effected organs, consisting of pure (undifferenced) intelligence\nit is quite impossible to ascribe either all-knowingness or limited knowledge;\nthe pradhana, on the other hand, because consisting of the three gu _n_ as,\ncomprises also in its pradhana state the element of Goodness which is the\ncause of all-knowingness. The Vedanta-passages therefore in\n\np. 47\n\na derived (figurative) sense ascribe all-knowingness to the pradhana, although\nit is in itself non-intelligent. Moreover you (the Vedantin) also who assume\nan all-knowing Brahman can ascribe to it all-knowingness in so far only as\nthat term means capacity for all knowledge. For Brahman cannot always be\nactually engaged in the cognition of everything; for from this there would\nfollow the absolute permanency of his cognition, and this would involve a want\nof independence on Brahman\'s part with regard to the activity of knowing. And\nif you should propose to consider Brahman\'s cognition as non-permanent it\nwould follow that with the cessation of the cognition Brahman itself would\ncease. Therefore all-knowingness is possible only in the sense of capacity for\nall knowledge. Moreover you assume that previously to the origination of the\nworld Brahman is without any instruments of action. But without the body, the\nsenses, &c. which are the instruments of knowledge, cognition cannot take\nplace in any being. And further it must be noted that the pradhana, as\nconsisting of various elements, is capable of undergoing modifications, and\nmay therefore act as a (material) cause like clay and other substances; while\nthe uncompounded homogeneous Brahman is unable to do so.\n\nTo these conclusions he (Vyasa) replies in the following Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[23:1](sbe34010.htm#fr_73) So, for instance, the passage \'he carves the\nsacrificial post and p. 24 Footnote: makes it eight-cornered,\' has a purpose\nonly as being supplementary to the injunction \'he ties the victim to the\nsacrificial post.\'\n\n[24:1](sbe34010.htm#fr_74) If the fruits of the two _s_ astras were not of a\ndifferent nature, there would be no reason for the distinction of two _s_\nastras; if they p. 25 are of a different nature, it cannot be said that the\nknowledge of Brahman is enjoined for the purpose of final release, in the same\nway as sacrifices are enjoined for the purpose of obtaining the heavenly world\nand the like.\n\n[28:1](sbe34010.htm#fr_75) The first passage shows that the Self is not joined\nto the gross body; the second that it is not joined to the subtle body; the\nthird that is independent of either.\n\n[28:2](sbe34010.htm#fr_76) \xc3\x82nanda Giri omits \'ata _h_.\' His comment is: p _ri_\nthag _g_ i _g \xc3\xb1_asavishayatva _k_ _k_ a dharmadyasp _ri_ sh _t_ atva _m_\nbrahma _n_ o yuktam ityaha tad iti  ata _h_ _s_ abdapa _th_ e dharmadyasparse\nkarmaphalavailaksba _n_ ya _m_ hetuk _ri_ tam.--The above translation follows\nGovindananda\'s first explanation.

The legitimacy of this appeal might be contested on\nthe ground that a prohibitory passage also, (as, for instance, \'a Brahma _n_ a\nis not to be killed,\') can be explained as enjoining a positive action, viz.\nsome action opposed in nature to the one forbidden, so that the quoted passage\nmight be interpreted to mean \'a determination, &c. of not killing a Brahma _n_\na is to be formed;\' just as we understand something positive by the expression\n\'a non-Brahma _n_ a,\' viz. some man who is a kshattriya or something else. To\nthis the answer is that, wherever we can, we must attribute to the word \'not\'\nits primary sense which is the absolute negation of the word to which it is\njoined; so that passages where it is joined to words denoting action must be\nconsidered to have for their purport the entire absence of action. Special\ncases only are excepted, as the one alluded to in the text where certain\nprohibited actions are enumerated under the heading of vows; for as a vow is\nconsidered as something positive, the non-doing of some particular action must\nthere be understood as intimating the performance of some action of an\nopposite nature.
