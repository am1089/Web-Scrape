Now, the gods said, 'Meditate ye!'--whereby, no doubt, they meant\nto say, 'Seek ye a layer 5 (for the fire-altar)! 'Whilst they were meditating,\n\np. 187\n\n[paragraph continues] Pra _g_ apati saw this earth, as a first naturally-\nperforated 1 layer: hence it is by means of Pra _g_ apati that he lays on that\n(brick) 2.\n\n6:2:3:22\\. Agni said to him (Pra _g_ apati), 'I will step\nnigh!'--'Wherewith?'--'With cattle!'--'So be it!' He thereby doubtless meant\nto say, 'with the cattle-brick;' for that cattle-brick is the same as the\ndurva-brick 3: hence the durva-brick is laid so as not to be separated from\nthe first naturally-perforated one; hence also not separated from this earth\nare the plants, the cattle, the fire,--for not separated (from the earth) 4 he\n(Agni) stepped nigh with this (brick).\n\n6:2:3:33\\. They said, 'Meditate ye yet!' whereby no doubt they meant to say,\n'Seek ye a layer! seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!' Whilst they were\n\np. 188\n\nmeditating, Indra and Agni, and Vi _s_ vakarman saw the air, as a second\nnaturally-perforated layer: hence he lays on that (brick 1) by means of Indra\nand Agni, and Vi _s_ vakarman.\n\n6:2:3:44\\. Vayu said to them, 'I will step nigh!' Wherewith!'--'With the\nregions!'--'So be it!' He thereby doubtless meant to say, 'with the regional\n(bricks 2):' hence on the second naturally-perforated one the regional ones\nare laid, without being separated from it 3; and hence not separated from the\nair are the regions, the wind; for not separated therefrom he (Vayu) stepped\nnigh with this (brick).\n\n6:2:3:55\\. They said, 'Meditate ye yet!'--whereby no doubt they said, 'Seek ye\na layer! seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!' Whilst they were meditating,\nParamesh _th_ in saw the sky, as a third naturally-perforated layer: whence it\nis by Paramesh _th_ in (the most high) he lays on that (brick 4).\n\np. 189\n\n6:2:3:66\\. Yonder Sun said to him, 'I will step nigh!'--'Wherewith?'--'With a\nspace-filling (brick 1).'--'So be it!'--Now he (the sun) indeed is the space-\nfiller: 'by (mine own) self,' he thus means to say. Hence the third naturally-\nperforated one is laid on so as not to be separated from the space-filling one\n2; and hence yonder sun is not separated from the sky, for not separated\ntherefrom did he step nigh with this (brick).\n\n6:2:3:77\\. These six deities forsooth became all this (universe), whatsoever\nexists here. The gods and the Rishis said, 'Those six deities forsooth have\nbecome all this (universe): bethink ye yourselves how we also may share\ntherein!' They said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby doubtless they meant to say, 'Seek\nye a layer! seek ye how we also may share in this 3! Whilst they were\nmeditating, the gods saw a second, the _Ri_ shis a fourth, layer 4.\n\n6:2:3:88\\. They said, 'We will step nigh!'--'Wherewith?'--'With what is over\nand above these worlds!'--'So be it!' Now what there is above the earth on\nthis side of the air, therewith the gods stepped nigh, that is this second\nlayer; and what there\n\np. 190\n\nis above the air on this side of the sky, therewith the Rishis stepped nigh,\nthat is this fourth layer.\n\n6:2:3:99\\. Now when they said, 'Meditate ye ( _k_ etayadhvam)!' they doubtless\nmeant to say, 'Seek ye a layer ( _k_ itim i _k_ _kh_ ata)!' and inasmuch as\nmeditating ( _k_ etay) they saw them, therefore they are 'layers' ( _k_ itaya\n_h_ ).\n\n6:2:3:1010\\. Pra _g_ apati saw the first layer: Pra _g_ apati assuredly is its\n(spiritual) ancestry. The gods saw the second layer: the gods assuredly are\nits ancestry. Indra and Agni, and Vi _s_ vakarman saw the third layer: they\nassuredly are its ancestry. The _Ri_ shis saw the fourth layer: the Rishis\nassuredly are its ancestry. Paramesh _th_ in saw the fifth layer: Paramesh\n_th_ in assuredly is its ancestry. And, verily, whosoever so knows that\n(spiritual) ancestry of the structures (layers of the fire-altar), his\nstructures are indeed possessed of an ancestry, possessed of relations (or, of\nmystic significance, bandhu).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[186:5](sbe4133.htm#fr_381) The author here connects the causal verb ' _k_\netay' (to reflect) with ' _k_ i,' to pile, to build; or rather with ' _k_ itim\nish,' to desire building (an altar).\n\n[187:1](sbe4133.htm#fr_382) See [p. 155](sbe4129.htm#page_155), note\n[8](sbe4129.htm#fn_316).\n\n[187:2](sbe4133.htm#fr_383) Or, that (layer), the three naturally-perforated\nbricks occupying the centre of the first, third, and fifth layers of the\naltar, these bricks are, as it were, the representatives of the respective\nlayers. This first svayam-at _ri_ _n_ _n_ a brick is laid down with the\nformula, 'May Pra _g_ apati settle thee!' See [VII, 4, 2,\n6](sbe4164.htm#7:4:2:6).\n\n[187:3](sbe4133.htm#fr_384) A stalk of Durva (Dub) grass--Panicum (or Cynodon)\ndactylon, or Agrostis linearis--is laid upon the first naturally-perforated\nbrick (which again lies on the man of gold) in such a way that the root lies\nupon it and the tops hanging down to the ground. 'Its flowers in the perfect\nstate are among the loveliest objects in the vegetable world, and appear\nthrough a lens like minute rubies and emeralds in constant motion from the\nleast breath of air. It is the sweetest and most nutritious pasture for\ncattle, and its usefulness, added to its beauty, induced the Hindus in the\nearliest ages to believe it was the mansion of a benevolent nymph.' Sir W.\nJones, Works, vol. v, p. 78. Professor R. Wallace, in his 'India in 1887,'\ngives an excellent illustration of this famous grass. He remarks (p. 282) that\nit has a wonderful power of remaining green, being the grass of all Indian\ngrasses which retains its succulence throughout the extreme heat of summer.'\n\n[187:4](sbe4133.htm#fr_385) That is to say, immediately after (the earth-brick\nhad been laid on).\n\n[188:1](sbe4133.htm#fr_386) This second naturally-perforated brick,\nrepresenting the air, forms the centre of the third layer of the altar. See\nVIII, 3, 1, 1 seq.\n\n[188:2](sbe4133.htm#fr_387) That is, the bricks marking the regions, or\nquarters (di _s_ ya); five of these are laid down immediately after the self-\nperforated one, in the four directions from it, two of them being laid on the\nsouth. See VIII, 3, 1, 11.\n\n[188:3](sbe4133.htm#fr_388) Viz. without being separated from the layer which\nthe second svayam-at _ri_ _n_ _n_ a represents. They would seem to lie about a\nfoot away from the central brick; but as no other special brick lies between\nthem, they may on that account be considered as not separated from it.\n\n[188:4](sbe4133.htm#fr_389) The third svayam-at _ri_ _n_ _n_ a, though\nconsidered as forming part of the fifth layer, is really laid on the top of it\nor rather on the 'puna _s_ _k_ iti'--an additional pile of eight bricks laid\nover the central, garhapatya-like, portion of the fifth layer (cf. [VI, 6, 1,\n14](sbe4145.htm#6:6:1:14), with note *[3](sbe4145.htm#fn_486)*). It is laid\ndown with the formula 'May the Most High settle thee!'--and on it the fire is\nsubsequently placed. See VIII, 7, 3, 13 seq.\n\n[189:1](sbe4133.htm#fr_390) See [p. 153](sbe4129.htm#page_153), note\n*[1](sbe4129.htm#fn_306)*.\n\n[189:2](sbe4133.htm#fr_391) The laying down of the last svayam-at _ri_ _n_ _n_\na (together with the likewise perforated 'vikar _n_ i') is immediately\npreceded by the filling up of the fifth layer with the 'space-filling' bricks,\nonly one of which has the common formula pronounced over it. See VIII, 7, 2, 1\nseq.\n\n[189:3](sbe4133.htm#fr_392) Viz. in this universe, and, as a representation\nthereof, in this fire-altar.\n\n[189:4](sbe4133.htm#fr_393) In the foregoing 1-5 paragraphs only those three\nlayers, which have a 'naturally-perforated' brick in the centre, viz. the\nfirst, third, and fifth layers, were mentioned. The author now remarks on the\ntwo other layers, representing as it were the space between the three worlds.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 3, 1. Third Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe4134.htm)\n\n"
