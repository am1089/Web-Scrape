And on account of (its) not being an instrument the objection is not\n(valid); for thus (scripture) declares.\n\nThe objection urged, viz. that there would result another sense-object, is not\nvalid; because the pra _n_ a is not an\n\np. 89\n\ninstrument. For we do not assume that the pra _n_ a is, like the eye, an organ\nbecause it determines a special sense-object. Nor is it on that account devoid\nof an effect; since scripture declares that the chief vital air has a specific\neffect which cannot belong to the other pra _n_ as. For in the so-called\ncolloquies of the pra _n_ as we read in the beginning, 'The pra _n_ as\nquarrelled together who was best;' after that we read, 'He by whose departure\nthe body seems worse than worst, he is the best of you;' thereupon the text,\nafter showing how, on the successive departure of speech and so on, the life\nof the body, although deprived of one particular function, went on as before,\nfinally relates that as soon as the chief pra _n_ a was about to depart all\nother pra _n_ as became loosened and the body was about to perish; which shows\nthat the body and all the senses subsist by means of the chief pra _n_ a. The\nsame thing is declared by another passage, 'Then pra _n_ a as the best said to\nthem: Be not deceived; I alone dividing myself fivefold support this body and\nkeep it' (Pr. Up. II, 3). Another passage, viz. 'With pra _n_ a guarding the\nlower nest' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 12), shows that the guarding of the body\ndepends on pra _n_ a. Again, two other passages show that the nourishing of\nthe body depends on pra _n_ a, 'From whatever limb pra _n_ a goes away that\nlimb withers' (B _ri_. Up. I, 3, 19), and 'What we eat and drink with it\nsupports the other vital breaths.' And another passage declares that the\nsoul's departing and staying depend on pra _n_ a, 'What is it by whose\ndeparture I shall depart, and by whose staying I shall stay?--The created pra\n_n_ a' (Pr. Up. VI, 3; 4).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 12](sbe38066.htm)\n\n"
