He married two wives: Pritha, who was chief rani, and\nMadri 2, whom he loved best.\n\nNow Pritha was of celestial origin, for her mother was a nymph; her father was\na holy Brahman, and her brother, Vasudeva, was the father of Krishna. 3 When\nbut a babe she had been adopted by the Rajah of Shurasena, whose kingdom was\namong the Vindhya mountains. She was of pious heart, and ever showed reverence\ntowards holy men. Once there came to the palace the great Rishi Durvasas, and\nshe ministered unto him faithfully by serving food at any hour he desired, and\nby kindling the sacred fire in the sacrificial chamber. After his stay, which\nwas in length a full year, Durvasas, in reward for her services, imparted to\nPritha a powerful charm 4, by\n\np. 174\n\nvirtue of which she could compel the love of a celestial being. One day she\nhad a vision of Surya, god of the sun; she muttered the charm, and received\nhim when he drew nigh in the attire of a rajah, wearing the celestial ear-\nrings. In secret she became in time the mother of his son, Karna, who was\nequipped at birth with celestial ear-rings and an invulnerable coat of mail,\nwhich had power to grow as the wearer increased in stature. The child had the\neyes of a lion and the shoulders of a bull.\n\nIn her maidenly shame Pritha resolved to conceal her new-born babe. So she\nwrapped him in soft sheets and, laying under his head a costly pillow, placed\nhim in a basket of wicker-work which she had smeared over with wax. Then,\nweeping bitterly, she set the basket afloat on the river, saying: "O my babe,\nbe thou protected by all who are on land, and in the water, and in the sky,\nand in the celestial regions! May all who see thee love thee! May Varuna, god\nof the waters, shield thee from harm! May thy father, the sun, give thee\nwarmth! . . . I shall know thee in days to come, wherever thou mayst be, by\nthy coat of golden mail. . . . She who will find thee and adopt thee will be\nsurely blessed. . . . O my son, she who will cherish thee will behold thee in\nyouthful prime like to a maned lion in Himalayan forests."\n\nThe basket drifted down the River Aswa until it was no longer seen by that\nlotus-eyed damsel, and at length it reached the Jumna; the Jumna gave it to\nthe Ganges, and by that great and holy river it was borne unto the country of\nAnga. . . . The child, lying in soft slumber, was kept alive by reason of the\nvirtues possessed by the celestial armour and the ear-rings.\n\nNow there was a woman of Anga who was named Radha, and she had peerless\nbeauty. Her husband was Shatananda, the charioteer. Both husband and wife had\n\np. 175\n\nfor long sorrowed greatly because that they could not obtain a son. One day,\nhowever, their wish was gratified. It chanced that Radha went down to the\nriver bank, and she beheld the basket drifting on the waves. She caused it to\nbe brought ashore; and when it was uncovered, she gazed with wonder upon a\nsleeping babe who was as fair as the morning sun. Her heart was immediately\nfilled with great gladness, and she cried out: "The gods have heard me at\nlength, and they have sent unto me a son." So she adopted the babe and\ncherished him. And the years went past, and Karna grew up and became a\npowerful youth and a mighty bowman.\n\nPritha, who was comely to behold, chose King Pandu at her swayamvara.\nTrembling with love, she placed the flower garland upon his shoulders.\n\nMadri came from the country of Madra 1, and was black-eyed and dusky-\ncomplexioned. She had been purchased by Bhishma for the king with much gold,\nmany jewels and elephants and horses, as was the marriage custom among her\npeople.\n\nThe glories of King Bharata\'s reign were revived by Pandu, who achieved great\nconquests and extended his territory. He loved well to go a-hunting, and at\nlength he retired to the Himalaya mountains with his two wives to pursue and\nslay deer. There, as fate had decreed, he met with dire misfortune. One day he\nshot arrows at two deer which he beheld sporting together; but they were, as\nhe discovered to his sorrow, a holy Brahman and his wife in animal guise. The\nsage was wounded mortally, and ere he died he assumed his wonted form, and\nforetold that Pandu, whom he cursed, would die in the arms of one of his\nwives.\n\nThe king was stricken with fear; he immediately took\n\np. 176\n\nvows of celibacy, and gave all his possessions to Brahmans; then he went away\nto live in a solitary place with his two wives.\n\nSome have told that Pandu never had children of his own, and that the gods\nwere the fathers of his wives\' great sons. Pritha was mother of Yudhishthira\n1, son of Dharma, god of justice, and of Bhima, son of Vayu, the wind god, and\nalso of Arjuna 2, son of mighty Indra, monarch of heaven. Madri received from\nPritha the charm which Durvasas had given her, and she became the mother of\nNakula and Sahadeva, whose sires were the twin Aswins, sons of Surya, the sun\ngod. These five princes were known as the Pandava brothers.\n\nKing Pandu was followed by his doom. One day, as it chanced, he met with\nMadri, his favourite wife; they wandered together in a forest, and when he\nclasped her in his arms he immediately fell dead as the Brahman had foretold.\n\nHis sons, the Pandava brothers, built his funeral pyre, so that his soul might\npass to heaven. Both Pritha and Madri desired to be burned with him, and they\ndebated together which of them should follow her lord to the region of the\ndead.\n\nSaid Pritha: "I must go hence with my lord. I was his first wife and chief\nrani. O Madri, yield me his body and rear our children together. O let me\nachieve what must be achieved."\n\nMadri said: "Speak not so, for I should be the chosen one. I was King Pandu\'s\nfavourite wife, and he died because that he loved me. O sister, if I survived\nthee I should not be able to rear our children as thou canst rear them. Do not\nrefuse thy sanction to this which is dear unto my heart."\n\np. 177\n\nSo they held dispute, nor could agree; but the Brahmans, who heard them, said\nthat Madri must be burned with King Pandu, having been his favourite wife. And\nso it came to pass that Madri laid herself on the pyre, and she passed in\nflames with her beloved lord, that bull among men.\n\nMeanwhile King Pandu\'s blind brother, Dhritarashtra, had ascended the throne\nto reign over the kingdom of Bharatavarsha, with Bhishma as his regent, until\nthe elder of the young princes should come of age.\n\nDhritarashtra had taken for wife fair Gandhari, daughter of the Rajah of\nGandhara. When she was betrothed she went unto the king with eyes blindfolded,\nand ever after-wards she so appeared in his presence. She became the mother of\na hundred sons, the eldest of whom was Duryodhana. These were the princes who\nwere named the Kauravas, after the country of Kuru-jangala. 1\n\nThe widowed Pritha returned to Hastinapur with her three sons and the two sons\nof Madri also. When she told unto Dhritarashtra that Pandu his brother had\ndied, he wept and mourned greatly; then he bathed in holy waters and poured\nforth the funeral oblation. The blind King gave his protection to the five\nprinces who were Pandu\'s heirs.\n\nSo the Pandavas and Kauravas were reared together in the royal palace at\nHastinapur. Nor was favour shown to one cousin more than another. The young\nprinces were trained to throw the stone and to cast the noose, and they\nengaged lustily in wrestling bouts and practised\n\np. 178\n\nboxing. As they grew up they shared work with the king\'s men; they marked the\nyoung calves, and every three years they counted and branded the cattle. Yet,\ndespite all that could be done, the two families lived at enmity. Of all the\nyoung men Bhima 1, of the Pandavas 2, was the most powerful, and Duryodhana 3,\nthe leader of the Kauravas, was jealous of him. Bhima was ever the victor in\nsports and contests. The Kauravas could ill endure his triumphs, and at length\nthey plotted among themselves to accomplish his death.\n\nIt chanced that the young men had gone to dwell in a royal palace on the banks\nof the Ganges. One day, when they feasted together in the manner of warriors,\nDuryodhana put poison in the food of Bhima, who soon afterwards fell into a\ndeep swoon and seemed to be dead. Then Duryodhana bound him hand and foot and\ncast him into the Ganges; his body was swallowed by the waters.\n\nBut it was not fated that Bhima should thus perish. As his body sank down, the\nfierce snakes, which are called Nagas, attacked him; but their poison counter-\nacted the poison he had already swallowed, so that he regained consciousness.\nThen, bursting his bonds, he scattered the reptiles before him, and they fled\nin terror.\n\nBhima found that he had sunk down to the city of serpents, which is in the\nunderworld. Vasuki, king of the Nagas, having heard of his prowess, hastened\ntowards the young warrior, whom he desired greatly to behold.\n\nBhima was welcomed by Aryaka, the great grandsire of Pritha, who was a dweller\nin the underworld. He\n\np. 179\n\nwas loved by Vasuki, who, for Aryaka\'s sake, offered great gifts to fearless\nBhima. But Aryaka chose rather that the lad should be given a draught of\nstrength which contained the virtues of a thousand Nagas. By the king of\nserpents was this great boon granted, and Bhima was permitted to drain the\nbowl eight times. He immediately fell into a deep slumber, which continued for\nthe space of eight days. Then he awoke, and the Nagas feasted him ere he\nreturned again unto his mother and his brethren, who were mourning for him the\nwhile. Thus it fell that Bhima triumphed over Duryodhana, for ever afterwards\nhe possessed the strength of a mighty giant. He related unto his brothers all\nthat had befallen him, but they counselled him not to reveal his secret unto\nthe Kauravas, his cousins.\n\nAbout this time the prudent Bhishma deemed that the young men should be\ntrained to bear arms; so he searched far and wide for a preceptor who was at\nonce a warrior and a scholar, a pious and lofty-minded man, and a lover of\ntruth. Such was Drona, the brave and god-adoring son of Bharadwaja. He was\nwell pleased to have care of the princes, and to give them instruction worthy\nof their rank and martial origin.\n\nDrona had no mother: his miraculous birth was accomplished by a beautiful\nnymph, and his sire was Bharadwaja, a most pious Brahman. Of similar origin\nwas Drupada 1, son of a rajah named Prishata 2. Drona and Drupada were reared\ntogether like brothers by the wise Bharadwaja, and it was the hope of both\nsires that their sons would repeat their own lifelong friendship. But when,\nafter happy youth, they grew into manhood, fate parted them. The rajah retired\nfrom the throne, and\n\np. 180\n\n[paragraph continues] Drupada ruled the kingdom of Panchala 1. Bharadwaja died\nsoon afterwards, and Drona married a wife named Kripa, who became the mother\nof his son Ashwatthama 2. The child was so named because at birth he uttered a\ncry like to the neighing of a horse. Drona devoted himself to rearing his son,\nwhile he accumulated the wisdom of the sages and performed sacred rites with\npious mind like to his holy sire.\n\nWhen the sage Jamadagni, son of Bhrigu, closed his career, he bestowed his\ngreat wealth on the sons of Brahmans. Drona received heavenly weapons and\npower to wield them. Then he bethought him to visit Drupada, the friend of his\nyouth, and share his inheritance with him. 3\n\nDrona stood before the rajah and exclaimed: "Behold thy friend."\n\nBut Drupada frowned; his eyes reddened with anger, and for a while he sat in\nsilence. At length he spoke haughtily and said:\n\n"Brahman, it is nor wise nor fitting that thou shouldst call me friend. What\nfriendship can there be between a luckless beggar and a mighty rajah? . . . I\ngrant that in youth such a bond united us, one to another, but it has wasted\naway with the years. Do not think that the friendship of youth endures for\never in human hearts; it is weakened by time, and pride plucks it from one\'s\nbosom. Friendship can exist only between equals as we two once were, but no\nlonger chance to be. Hear and know! Rich and poor, wise and ignorant, warriors\nand cowards, can never be friends; it is for those who are of equal station to\nexercise mutual esteem. . . . Say, can a\n\np. 181\n\nBrahman respect one who is ignorant of the Vedas? Can a warrior do other than\ndespise one who cannot go forth to battle in his rumbling chariot? Say, can a\nmonarch condescend to one who is far beneath him? . . . Begone, then, thou\ndreamer! Forget the days and the thoughts of the past. . . . I know thee not.\n. . ."\n\nDrona heard the harsh words of his old friend with mute amaze. For a moment he\npaused. Then abruptly he turned away, nor spake he in reply. His heart burned\nwith indignation as he hastened out of the city.\n\nIn time he reached the city of Hastinapur, and Bhishma bade him welcome. When\nDrona undertook the training of the princes he said: "I will do as is thy\ndesire, O Bhishma, but on condition that when the young men are become\ncomplete warriors they will help me to fight against mine enemy, Drupada, the\nRajah of Panchala."\n\nBhishma gave willing consent to this condition. Thereafter Drona abode with\nhis wife in the royal palace, and his son Ashwatthama was trained with the\nPandavas and Kauravas. He became the family priest as well as the instructor\nof the princes. And ere long the young men were accomplished warriors, and\ndeeply learned in wisdom and in goodness.\n\nDrona took most delight in the Pandavas. Yudhishthira was trained as a\nspearman, but he was more renowned as a scholar than for feats of arms. Arjuna\nsurpassed all others in warrior skill; he was of noble bearing, and none like\nhim could ride the steed, guide the elephant, or drive the rattling chariot,\nnor could any other prince withstand his battle charge or oppose him in single\ncombat. He was unequalled with javelin or dart, with battleaxe or mace, and he\nbecame the most famous archer of his\n\np. 182\n\nday. Strong Bhima learned to wield the club, Nakula acquired the secret of\ntaming steeds, and Sahadeva became a mighty swordsman, and acquired great\nknowledge of astronomy.\n\nDrona trained the Kauravas with diligence also, as well as his own son, who\nwas wise and brave; but among all his pupils he loved Arjuna best, for he was\nthe most modest and the most perfect, the most fearless, and yet the most\nobedient to his preceptor.\n\nDuryodhana of the Kauravas was jealous of all the Pandavas, and especially of\nArjuna.\n\nThe fame of Drona as a preceptor was spread far and wide, and the sons of many\nrajahs and warriors hastened to Hastinapur to be instructed by him. All were\nwelcomed save one, and he was the son of the rajah of the robber Bhils. This\nyoung man pleaded that he might be trained as an archer, but without avail.\nDrona said: "Are not the Bhils highwaymen and cattle-lifters? It would be a\nsin, indeed, to impart unto one of them great knowledge in the use of\nweapons."\n\nWhen he heard these words, the rajah\'s son was stricken with grief, and he\nturned homeward. But he resolved to become an accomplished warrior. So he\nfashioned a clay image of Drona and worshipped it, and wielded the bow before\nit until his fame as an archer was noised abroad.\n\nOne day Drona went forth with the princes to hunt in the Bhil kingdom. Their\ndog ran through the woods, and it beheld the dark son of the rajah of the\nBhils and barked at him. Desiring to display his skill, the young man shot\nseven arrows into the dog\'s mouth ere it could be closed, and, moaning and\nbleeding, the animal returned thus to the princes.\n\nWondering greatly, the princes searched for the greatly-skilled\n\np. 183\n\narcher, and found him busy with his how. They spoke, saying: "Who art thou?"\nAnd the Bhil made answer: "I am a pupil of Drona."\n\nWhen Drona was brought to the place, the young man kissed his feet.\n\nSaid the wise preceptor: "If thou art my pupil, I must receive my reward."\n\nThe young man made answer: "Command me, and I will give thee whatsoever thou\ndost desire."\n\nSaid Drona: "I should like to have the thumb of thy right hand."\n\nThe faithful prince of the Bhils did not hesitate to obey his preceptor; with\na cheerful face he severed his thumb from his right hand and gave it to Drona.\n\nAfter his wound had healed, the young man began to draw his bow with his\nmiddle fingers, but found that he had lost his surpassing skill, whereat\nArjuna was made happy.\n\nAll the other Bhil warriors who trained in archery followed the prince\'s\nexample and drew the how with their middle fingers, and this custom prevailed\never afterwards amongst the tribe.\n\nNow when all the Hastinapur princes had become expert warriors, Drona\naddressed the blind king, as he sat among his counsellors, and said: "O mighty\nrajah, thy sons and the sons of thy brother Pandu have now attained surpassing\nskill in arms, and they are fit to enter the battlefield."\n\nSaid the king, who was well pleased: "So thy task is finished, O noble son of\nBharadwaja? Let now a place be made ready, in accordance with thy desire, so\nthat the princes may display their martial skill in the presence of their\npeers and the common people."\n\nThen Drona, accompanied by Vidura, the king\'s\n\np. 184\n\nbrother, made choice of a wide and level plain on which the Pandavas and\nKauravas might perform their mighty feats.\n\nSo be it next told of the great tournament on the plain, and of the coming of\nillustrious Karna.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[173:1](iml15.htm#fr_214) _Pron_. pan\xc2\xb4davas _and_ kow\xc2\xb4ravas.\n\n[173:2](iml15.htm#fr_215) _Pron_. pree\xc2\xb4tha _and_ ma-dree\xc2\xb4.\n\n[173:3](iml15.htm#fr_216) Krishna of the Yadavas was descended from the moon\nthrough Yadu: Bharata was descended through Puru, Yadu\'s brother.\n\n[173:4](iml15.htm#fr_217) A _mantra_.\n\n[175:1](iml15.htm#fr_218) Identified with Cashmere by some of the authorities.\n\n[176:1](iml15.htm#fr_219) _Pron_. yoo-dish\xc2\xb4thi-ra ( _h_ sounded after _t_ ).\n\n[176:2](iml15.htm#fr_220) _Pron_. arjoo\xc2\xb4na\xe2\x80\xb3.\n\n[177:1](iml15.htm#fr_221) The upper part of the Punjab, which was ruled over\nultimately by the sons of Duryodhana.
