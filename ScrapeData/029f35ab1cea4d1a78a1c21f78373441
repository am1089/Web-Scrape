Janamejaya spoke :-- O Dvija! I have heard in detail the Devi Yaj\xc3\xb1a,\nperformed by S\xc2\x92ri Vi _sn_ u. Now describe Her Glory and glorious deeds. After\nhearing these, the Devi\xc2\x92s glorious deeds, I will also perform that, the best\nof all sacrifices. Thereby I will no doubt be pure through your favour.\n\n\n\n3\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! Hear, I am describing to you the history of the\nmost auspicious mighty deeds of the Devi, according to the Pura _n_ as.\n\n\n\n4-5. In days of yore, there reigned in the country of Kosala, the king\nDhruvasandhi of the Solar Dynasty. He was the son of Pu _s_ pa and cele-\n\n\n\np. 175\n\n\n\nbrated on account of his great prowess. He was truthful, religious, engaged in\ndoing good to his subjects, obeying the laws of the four castes and \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92ramas.\nHe being pure, performed his regal duties in the flourishing city of Ayodhya.\n\n\n\n6\\. The Brahma _n_ as, K _s_ attriyas, Vais'yas, and S\xc2\x92udras and other good\npersons all lived religiously under his rule, each abiding by his own\nprofession.\n\n\n\n7\\. No thieves, cheats, cunning persons, vain and arrogant persons,\ntreacherous and illiterate men were allowed to remain in his kingdom.\n\n\n\n8\\. O host of Kurus! Thus ruling virtuously, the king had two wives, both of\nthem young, fair and beautiful and well able to give delights and enjoyments\nto the king.\n\n\n\n9\\. The first and lovely wife was Manorama, and the second was Lilavati. Both\nof them were exceedingly handsome, intelligent and qualified.\n\n\n\n10\\. The king enjoyed much with them in palaces, gardens, romantic hills,\nlakes, and various beautiful mansions.\n\n\n\n11\\. In the auspicious moment, Manorama gave birth to a beautiful child,\nendowed with all royal qualifications. The child was named, in due course,\nSudars\xc2\x92ana.\n\n\n\n12\\. Next within one month, his second wife the fair Lilavati in the\nauspicious fortnight and in the auspicious day, gave birth to an excellent\nchild.\n\n\n\n13\\. The King then performed the Jata-Karma (ceremonies on the birth of a\nchild) and being very glad, made lots of presents, wealth, etc., to the Brahma\n_n_ as.\n\n\n\n14\\. The King shewed affection equally to the two children; never he made any\ndistinction between them.\n\n\n\n15\\. The king, the tormenter of the foes, was very glad and performed duly the\nchu _d_ a kara _n_ a ceremony according to his position and wealth.\n\n\n\n16\\. The sight of these two sons delighted very much the people. Now seeing\nthese Kritachu _d_ as, and playing, the king was merged in the ocean of\npleasure.\n\n\n\n17-18. Sudars'ana was the eldest; but Satrujit, the second beautiful son by\nLilavati was of sweet and persuasive speech. His beautiful figure and sweet\nwords gave very much delight to the king, and for these qualities, the child\nSatrujit turned out also a favourite of the people and ministers.\n\n\n\np. 176\n\n\n\n19\\. The king could not show so much affection to the unfortunate Sudars\xc2\x92ana\nas he showed to Satrujit.\n\n\n\n20-21. Thus some days having passed, one day the king Dhruvasandhi went out on\nan hunting expedition to the forest. He killed in the forest many deer, Ruru\n(a kind of deer), elephants, boar, hare, buffaloes, rhinoceros, camels and\namused himself very much with this hunting affair.\n\n\n\n22-23. While he was hunting thus, a lion got very much enraged, and, from a\nbush, suddenly jumped and came upon the king. That king of the beasts was\nalready struck with arrows; now seeing the king in front, he loudly roared.\n\n\n\n24-25. He angrily lifted his long tail high up in the air and, puffing up his\nmanes, jumped up high in the air to attack and to take the life of the king.\nSeeing this, instantly the king took sword in his right hand and shield in his\nleft and stationed himself like another lion before him.\n\n\n\n26\\. The king's followers, one and all, angrily shot arrows on the lion.\n\n27\\. Then a loud uproar ensued; and all began to hurl arrows as best as they\ncould. But, after all, that dangerous lion fell upon the king.\n\n\n\n28-29. Seeing thus, the king struck him with his sword, but the lion also tore\nasunder the king, with his sharp nails. The king thus struck by the lion, fell\non the spot and died. The soldiers cried aloud and killed the lion with\narrows.\n\n\n\n30\\. Thus both the king and lion lay dead on the spot; and the soldiers turned\nback to the palace and gave all the informations to the royal ministers.\n\n\n\n31\\. When the munis heard the demise of the king, they went to the forest,\nperformed the burning of the dead body of the king.\n\n\n\n32\\. The Mahar _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha performed duly on the same spot, all the\nfuneral ceremonies, thus ensuring the king the safe journey to the next world.\n\n\n\n33\\. All the subjects and the citizens and the Muni Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha counselled\neach other to install Sudars\xc2\x92ana on the throne as the king.\n\n\n\n34-35. The minister-in-chief as well as the other members proposed that as\nSudars\xc2\x92ana is the son of the legal wife, calm and quiet, beautiful and endowed\nwith all the royal qualifications, he is fit for the throne. Mahar _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i\n_st_ ha said, the royal son, though not attained to proper age is still\nreligious; therefore he is really fit be installed as king on the royal\nthrone.\n\n\n\n36\\. When the wise aged ministers thus decided, Yudhajit, the king of Ujjain,\non hearing the decision hastened to the spot.\n\n\n\np. 177\n\n\n\n37\\. He was the father of Lilavati; on hearing the demise of his son-in-law he\ncame there, so that his daughter\xc2\x92s son might get the kingdom.\n\n\n\n38\\. Next, Virasena, the king of the country of Kalinga and the father of\nManorama, came there also with the object that his daughter\xc2\x92s son Sudars\xc2\x92ana\nbe the Emperor.\n\n\n\n39\\. The two kings, accompanied respectively by their own army and soldiers,\nbegan to counsel with the aged ministers, each trying so that his daughter\xc2\x92s\nson may get the throne.\n\n\n\n40\\. Yudhajit made the question :-- \xc2\x93Who is the eldest of the two sons? Is it\nalways the case that the eldest will inherit the kingdom? Will not the\nyoungest ever be able to acquire it?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n41\\. Virasena said :-- O king! He who is the son of the legal wife inherits\nthe kingdom; this I have heard from the learned who are proficient in the\nknowledge of the S\xc2\x92astras.\n\n\n\n42\\. Hearing Virasena, Yudhajit repeated \xc2\x93Sudars\xc2\x92ana is not so qualified with\nroyal qualifications and other matters as this son of the late king, Satrujit.\nHow can then Sudars\xc2\x92ana inherit the throne?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n43\\. O King! Then quarrels ensued amongst the two kings. Now, at this critical\njuncture, who is able to solve their doubts?\n\n\n\n44\\. Yudhajit then addressed the ministers :-- \xc2\x93You all are prompted by\nselfish ends; you want to acquire a good deal of money by making Sudars\xc2\x92ana\nthe king.\n\n\n\n45-46. I have come to know by your gestures and postures that your decision is\nto the above affect. After all, as Satrujit possesses many more qualifications\nthan Sudars\xc2\x92ana, he has more claims to the throne; and therefore he is fit to\noccupy the throne and no other. Morever, let me see as long as I live who can\nset aside the claims of a qualified prince, in possession of an army, and put\nforward the claims of a prince who has no qualifications it all.\n\n\n\n47\\. I am ready to fight and I will tear the earth into two pieces by my\nsword. What more have you to say on this?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n48\\. Hearing this, Virasena addressed Yudhajit \xc2\x93I see the two boy\xc2\x92s\nintelligence the same. You are intelligent; kindly mention where is the\ndifference?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n49\\. O king! The two kings quarrelling with each other, remained there; the\nsubjects and the Ri _s_ is, seeing this, were very anxious.\n\n\n\n50\\. Hundreds of tributary princes wanting that the two kings might be\n\n\n\np. 178\n\n\n\ninvolved into quarrels with each other, came to the spot, with their soldiers,\nthough they had to undergo great hardships in doing so.\n\n\n\n51\\. Many aborigines, from the inhabitants of Sringaverpur, hearing the demise\nof the late king, also appeared on the scene with the sole object to plunder.\n\n\n\n52\\. The two princes are minors; and hearing their parties at war with each\nother, many robbers from various adjoining countries came also there.\n\n\n\n53\\. Thus when the war broke out between the two kings, the great confusion\nand tumult across within the kingdoms; on the other hand, Yudhajit and\nVirasena both became ready to fight.\n\n\n\nThus ends the Fourteenth Chapter on the narration of the glories of the Devi\nand the death of the Kosala king Dhruva Sandhi in the 3rd Adhayaya of S'ri Mad\nDevi Bhagavatam.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 15](bk03ch15.htm)\n\n"
