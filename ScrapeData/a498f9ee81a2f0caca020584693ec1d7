How do they function? To\nwhom belongs this power? He to whom this power belongs, what is He?"\n\nPippal\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da then having deeply considered, imparted to him the Brahmavi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81\n(divine wisdom), that most excellent of all things. "It is pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a ( _i.e._ ,)\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. It is \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 that exercises this power. It is the life of all \xe1\xb8\x8cevas. It is\ntheir death and (their) life. Brahman that shines pure, nishkala, resplendent,\nand all-pervading, in this divine Brahmapura (of body), rules (all). The J\xc4\xabva\n(identifying himself with) the in\xe1\xb8\x8driyas, rules them like a spider. The spider\nthrows out from a single thread out of his body a whole web, and draws it into\nhimself by that same thread; so pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, whenever it goes, draws after it the\nobjects of its creation (v\xc4\x81k, etc.). During sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi, (the pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a) goes to its\nseat (Brahman) through the n\xc4\x81dis of which is the \xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81, like an eagle, that\nmaking air as the means of communication, reaches his abode. They say, as\n\xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb8\x8da\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, though beaten (during sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi) by a stick, etc., does not move, so\nalso the actor does not suffer or enjoy for the\n\np. 107\n\nmerits or demerits of religious actions. Just as a child obtains happiness\nwithout desiring for it (in play), so also \xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb8\x8da\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada obtains happiness in\nsushup\xe1\xb9\xadi. He certainly knows, (being) Param-Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis, and the person desiring\njyo\xe1\xb9\xadis, enjoys bliss in the contemplation of jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis. Then he comes back to the\ndream-plane by the same way, like a caterpillar. It remaining on a blade of\ngrass, first puts forward its foot on another blade in front, conveys its body\nto it, and having got a firm hold of it, then only leaves the former and not\nbefore. So this is the j\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xada state. As this (\xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb8\x8da\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada) bears at the same\ntime eight skulls, so this j\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xada, the source of \xe1\xb8\x8cevas and Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, clings to a\nman like the breasts in a woman. During the j\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xada avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81, merit and demerit\nare postulated of this Deva (power); he is capable of great expansion and is\nthe inner mover. He is khaga (bird), karkata (crab), pushkara (\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b), pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a,\npain, par\xc4\x81para, \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and Brahman. This deity causes to know. He who knows thus\nobtains Brahman, the supreme, the support of all things, and the Kshe\xe1\xb9\xadraj\xc3\xb1a.\nHe obtains Brahman, the supreme, support of all things, and the Kshe\xe1\xb9\xadraj\xc3\xb1a.\n\n 1 "The Pursuha has four seats--navel, heart, neck, and head. There Brahman\nwith the four feet specially shines. Those feet are j\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xada, svapna, sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi,\nand \xe1\xb9\xadurya. In j\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xada he is Brahm\xc4\x81, in svapna Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, in sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra, and\nin \xe1\xb9\xadurya the supreme Akshara. He is A\xe1\xb8\x8di\xe1\xb9\xadya, Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara, Purusha, pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a,\nj\xc4\xabva, agni, the resplendent. The Para-Brahman shines in the midst of these. He\nis without manas, ear, hands, feet, and light. There the worlds are no worlds,\n\xe1\xb8\x8cevas no \xe1\xb8\x8cevas, Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das no Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das, sacrifices no sacrifices, mother no mother,\nfather no father, daughter-in-law no daughter-in-law, cha\xe1\xb9\x85d\xc4\x81la no cha\xe1\xb9\x85d\xc4\x81la,\npaulkasa no paulkasa, \xc5\x9brama\xe1\xb9\x87a no \xc5\x9brama\xe1\xb9\x87a, hermits no hermits; so one only\nBrahman shines as different. In the H\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb8\x8day\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b (\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b in the heart) is the\nChi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. That is Brahman. It is extremely subtle. The H\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb8\x8day\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b can be known.\nThis moves in it. In Brahman, everything is strung. Those who thus know the\nLord know everything. In him the \xe1\xb8\x8cevas, the worlds, the Pi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\x9bs and the \xe1\xb9\x9ashis do\nnot rule. He who has awakened knows everything.\n\np. 108\n\n[paragraph continues] All the \xe1\xb8\x8cevas are in the heart; in the heart are all the\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as: in the heart are pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis and that three-plied holy thread. In\nthe heart in Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya, it (pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a) is.  1 Put on the yaj\xc3\xb1opav\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada (holy\nthread), the supreme, the holy, which came into existence along with the\nPraj\xc4\x81pa\xe1\xb9\xadi, which gives long life and which is very excellent; let this give\nyou strength and \xe1\xb9\xadejas. The wise man having shaved his head completely, should\nthrow away the external thread. He should wear, as the holy thread, the\nsupreme and indestructible Brahman. It is called s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra, because s\xc5\xabchan\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xad\n(indicating) (that the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is in the heart). S\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra means the supreme abode.\nHe who knows that s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra is a vipra (br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a), he has crossed the ocean of the\nVe\xe1\xb8\x8das. On that s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra (thread), everything is strung, like the beads on the\nthread. The yogin, well versed in yoga and having a clear perception of Truth,\nshould wear the thread. Practising the noble yoga, the wise man should abandon\nthe external thread. He who wears the s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra as Brahman, he is an intelligent\nbeing. By wearing the s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra, he is not polluted. They whose s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra is within,\nwhose yaj\xc3\xb1opav\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada is j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na--they only know the s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra, and, they only wear the\nyaj\xc3\xb1opav\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada in this world. Those whose tuft of hair is j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, who are firmly\ngrounded in j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and whose yaj\xc3\xb1opav\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada is j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, consider j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na only as\nsupreme. J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is holy and excellent. He whose \xc5\x9bikh\xc4\x81 (tuft of hair) is j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na\nlike the \xc5\x9bikhi (flame of agni)--he, the wise one, only wears a true \xc5\x9bikh\xc4\x81;\nothers wear a mere tuft of hair. Those br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as and others who perform the\nceremonies prescribed in the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das--they wear this thread only as a symbol of\ntheir ceremonies. Those who know the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das say that he only is a true br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a\nwho wears the \xc5\x9bikh\xc4\x81 of j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and whose yaj\xc3\xb1opav\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada is the same (j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na). This\nyaj\xc3\xb1opav\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada (Yaj\xc3\xb1a means Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u or sacrifice and Upav\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada is that which\nsurrounds; hence that which surrounds Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u) is supreme and is the supreme\nrefuge. He who wears that really knows--he only wears the s\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadra, he is Yaj\xc3\xb1a\n(Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u) and he only knows Yaj\xc3\xb1a (Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u). One God hidden in all things,\npervades all things and is the Inner Life of all things. He awards the fruits\n\np. 109\n\nof karma, he lives in all things, he sees all things without any extraneous\nhelp, he is the soul of all, there is nothing like him, and he is without any\ngu\xe1\xb9\x87as (being secondless). He is the great wise one. He is the one doer among\nthe many action-less objects. He is always making one thing appear as several\n(by m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81). Those wise men who see him in bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, they only obtain eternal\npeace. Having made \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as the (upper) ara\xe1\xb9\x87i (attritional piece of wood) and\nPra\xe1\xb9\x87ava the lower ara\xe1\xb9\x87i, by constant practice of \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na one should see the\nconcealed deity. As the oil in the sesamum seed, as the ghee in the curds, as\nthe water in the rivers, and as the fire in the ara\xe1\xb9\x87i, so they who practise\ntruth and austerities see Him in the bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. As the spider throws out and\ndraws into itself the threads, so the j\xc4\xabva goes and returns during the j\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xada\nand the svapna states. The heart is in the form of a closed lotus-flower, with\nits head hanging down; it has a hole in the top. Know it to be the great abode\nof All. Know that during j\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xada it (j\xc4\xabva) dwells in the eye, and during\nsvapna in the throat; during sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi, it is in the heart and during \xe1\xb9\xadurya in\nthe head.  1 (Because bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi unites) the Pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma with the Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma, the\nworship of san\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81 (union) arose. So we should perform san\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81van\xe1\xb8\x8dana (rites).\nThe san\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81van\xe1\xb8\x8dana performed by \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na requires no water. It gives no trouble\nto the body or the speech. That which unites all things is the san\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81 of the\none-staffed (sanny\xc4\x81sins). Knowing That from which speech and mind turn back\nwithout being able to obtain it and That which is the bliss of j\xc4\xabva, the wise\none is freed. The secret of Brahmavi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 is to reveal the real nature of the\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, that is all-pervading, that is like ghee in the milk, that is the source\nof \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadmavi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 and \xe1\xb9\xadapas and to show that everything is in essence one.\n\n"So ends the Brahmopanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[106:1](tmu15.htm#fr_62) In this Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d, the Southern Indian edition begins\nlater on but the other portions also are given as being fuller.\n\n[107:1](tmu15.htm#fr_63) The South Indian Edition begins here.\n\n[108:1](tmu15.htm#fr_64) This man\xe1\xb9\xadra is repeated whenever the holy thread is\nnewly worn.\n\n[109:1](tmu15.htm#fr_65) The five sentences from here relating to San\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81 are\nnot to be found in the South Indian Edition.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 14.
