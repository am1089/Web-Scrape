Vibhishan eyed  \nThe giants chief, and thus replied:  \n'This Rama, this is Ravan's son:  \nHigh fame his youthful might has won.  \nHe, best of warriors, bows his ear  \nThe wisdom of the wise to hear.  \nSupreme is he mid those who know  \nThe mastery of sword and bow.  \nUnrivalled in the bold attack  \nOn elephant's or courser's back,  \nHe knows, beside, each subtler art,  \nTo win the foe, to bribe, or part.  \nOn him the giant hosts rely,  \nAnd fear no ill when he is nigh.  \nThis peerless chieftain bears the name  \nOf Atikava huge of frame,  \nWhom Dhanyamalini of yore  \nTo Ravan lord of Lanka bore.'  \n   Roused by his bow-string's awful clang,  \nTo meet their foes the Vanars sprang.  \nArmed with tall trees from Lanka's wood,  \nAnd rocks and mountain peaks, they stood.  \nThe giant's arrows, gold-bedecked,  \nThe storm of hurtling missiles checked;  \nAnd ever on his foemen poured  \nFierce tempest from his clanging cord;  \nNor could the Vanar chiefs sustain  \nHis shafts' intolerable rain.  \nThey fled: the victor gained the place  \nWhere stood the lord of Raghu's race,  \nAnd cried with voice of thunder: 'Lo,  \nBorne on my car, with shaft and bow,  \nI, champion of the giants, scorn  \nTo fight with weaklings humbly born.  \nCome forth your bravest, if he dare,  \nAnd right with one who will not spare.'  \n   Forth sprang Sumitra's noble child,  1  \nAnd strained his ready bow, and smiled;  \nAnd giants trembled as the clang  \nThrough heaven and earth reechoing rang.  \nThe giant to his string applied  \nA pointed shaft, and proudly cried;  \n'Turn, turn, Sumitra's son and fly,  \nFor terrible as Death am I  \nFly, nor that youthful form oppose,  \nUntrained in war, to warriors' blows.  \nWhat! wilt thou waste thy childish breath  \nAnd wake the dormant fire of death?  \nCast down, rash boy, that useless bow:  \nPreserve thy life, uninjured go.'  \n   He ceased: and stirred by wrath & pride  \nSumitra's noble son replied:  \n'By warlike deed, not words alone,  \nThe valour of the brave is shown.  \nCease with vain boasts my scorn to move,  \n\nAnd with thine arm thy prowess prove.  \nBorne on thy car, with sword and bow,  \nWith all thine arms, thy valour show.  \nFight, and my deadly shafts this day  \nLow in the dust thy head shall lay,  \nAnd, rushing fast in ceaseless flood,  \nShall rend thy flesh and drink thy blood.'  \n   His giant foe no answer made,  \nBut on his string an arrow laid.  \nHe raised his arm, the cord he drew,  \nAt Lakshman's breast the arrow flew.  \nSumitra's son, his foemen's dread,  \nShot a fleet shaft with crescent head,  \nWhich cleft that arrow pointed well,  \nAnd harmless to the earth it fell.  \nA shower of shafts from Lakshman's bow  \nFell fast and furious on the foe  \nWho quailed not as the missiles smote  \nWith idle force his iron coat.  \nThen came the friendly Wind-God near,  \nAnd whispered thus in Lakshman's ear:  \n'Such shafts as these in vain assail  \nThy foe's impenetrable mail.  \nA more tremendous missile try,  \nOr never may the giant die.  \nEmploy the mighty spell, and aim  \nThe weapon known by Brahma's name.'  \nHe ceased - Sumitra's son obeyed:  \nOn his great bow the shaft was laid,  \nAnd with a roar like thunder, true  \nAs Indra's flashing bolt, it flew.  \nThe giant poured his shafts like rain  \nTo check its course, but all in vain.  \nWith spear and mace and sword he tried  \nTo turn the fiery dart aside.  \nWinged with a force which naught could check.  \nIt smote the monster in the neck,  \nAnd, sundered from his shoulders, rolled  \nTo earth his head and helm of gold.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[482:1](ry467.htm#fr_1005) The demon of eclipse who seizes the Sun and Moon.\n\n[483:1](ry467.htm#fr_1006) Lakshman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXII.: Ravan's Speech.](ry468.htm)\n\n"
