Thereupon, taking the clipping-spoon (sruva) and the pot for\nmelting butter, he goes to the \xc3\x82havaniya fire. He either offers those twelve\naptis 1, or makes (the Sacrificer) pronounce (the\n\np. 30\n\nformulas). Whether he offers, or makes him pronounce (the formulas), the\nsignificance is the same.\n\n5:2:1:22\\. He offers, with (Va _g_. S. IX, 20), 'To the ally, hail!--To the\ngood ally, hail!--To the after-born, hail!--To the purpose, hail!--To the\nVasu, hail!--To the Lord of day, hail!--To the failing day, hail!--To the\nfailing one, sprung from the evanescent, hail!--To the evanescent one, sprung\nfrom the terminal, hail!--To the terminal descendant of being, hail!--To the\nLord of being, hail!--To the over-lord, hail!' These twelve aptis\n(obtainments) he offers, because there are twelve months in the year, and Pra\n_g_ apati is the year, and the sacrifice is Pra _g_ apati: hence whatever\nobtainment, whatever accomplishment there is for him 1, that he thereby wins,\nthat he makes his own.\n\n5:2:1:33\\. He then either offers six k _li_ ptis 2, or makes (the Sacrificer)\npronounce them. Whether he offers, or makes him pronounce them, the\nsignificance is the same.\n\n5:2:1:44\\. He makes him pronounce (Va _g_. S. IX, 21), 'May the life prosper\nthrough sacrifice!--May the breath prosper through sacrifice!--May the eye\nprosper through sacrifice!--May the ear prosper through sacrifice!--May the\nback prosper through sacrifice!--May the sacrifice\n\np. 31\n\nprosper through sacrifice!' These six k _li_ ptis he makes him pronounce,\nbecause there are six seasons in the year, and Pra _g_ apati is the year, and\nthe sacrifice is Pra _g_ apati: thus whatever success, whatever accomplishment\nthere is for him, that he thereby wins, that he makes his own.\n\n5:2:1:55\\. The sacrificial post is eight-cornered; for the Gayatri metre has\neight syllables, and the Gayatri is Agni's metre: he thereby wins the world of\nthe gods. The post is either wrapt up, or bound up, in seventeen cloths; for\nPra _g_ apati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra _g_ apati.\n\n5:2:1:66\\. There is a wheaten head-piece 1 on it; for man is nearest to Pra\n_g_ apati, and he is skinless 2. And among plants wheat comes nearest to man,\n(for) it has no skin: thus he thereby wins the world of men.\n\n5:2:1:77\\. The post has a hollow (at the top), and is not pointed at the end;\nfor the hollow is sacred to the Fathers: he thus gains the world of the\nFathers. It is seventeen cubits long, for Pra _g_ apati is seventeen-fold: he\nthus wins Pra _g_ apati.\n\n5:2:1:88\\. Thereupon the Nesh _t_ _ri_ , being about to lead up the\n(Sacrificer's) wife, makes her wrap round herself, over the garment of\nconsecration, a cloth, or skirt, made of Ku _s_ a grass 3; for she, the wife,\nis the hind\n\np. 32\n\npart of the sacrifice 1; and he wishes her, thus coming forward, to propitiate\nthe sacrifice. But impure is that part of woman which is below the navel, and\npure are the plants of (Ku _s_ a) grass: thus having, by means of those plants\nof (Ku _s_ a) grass, made pure whatever part of her is impure, he causes her\nto propitiate the sacrifice, while coming forward. This is why the Nesh _t_\n_ri_ , being about to lead up the wife, makes her wrap round herself, over the\ngarment of consecration, a cloth, or skirt, made of Ku _s_ a grass.\n\n5:2:1:99\\. He then leans a ladder (against the post). He may ascend either\nfrom the south northwards, or from the north southwards; but let him rather\nascend from the south northwards (udak), for thus it goes upwards (udak).\n\n5:2:1:1010\\. Being about to ascend, he (the Sacrificer) addresses his wife,\n'Come, wife, ascend we the sky!'--'Ascend we!' says the wife. Now as to why he\naddresses his wife: she, the wife, in sooth is one half of his own self;\nhence, as long as he does not obtain her, so long he is not regenerated, for\nso long he is incomplete. But as soon as he obtains her he is regenerated, for\nthen he is complete. 'Complete I want to go to that supreme goal,' thus (he\nthinks) and therefore he addresses his wife.\n\n5:2:1:1111\\. He ascends, with, 'We have become Pra _g_ apati's children;' for\nhe who offers the Va _g_ apeya indeed becomes Pra _g_ apati's child:\n\n5:2:1:1212\\. He then touches the wheat (top-piece) 2, with,\n\np. 33\n\n[paragraph continues] 'We have gone to the light, O ye gods!' for he who\noffers the Va _g_ apeya, indeed goes to the light.\n\n5:2:1:1313\\. And as to why he touches the wheat: wheat is food, and he who\noffers the Va _g_ apeya, wins food, for va _g_ a-peya is the same as anna-peya\n(food and drink): thus whatever food he has thereby won, therewith now that he\nhas gone to that supreme goal, he puts himself in contact, and possesses\nhimself of it,--therefore he touches the wheat (top-piece).\n\n5:2:1:1414\\. He then rises by (the measure of) his head over the post, with,\n'We have become immortal!' whereby he wins the world of the gods.\n\n5:2:1:1515\\. Thereupon, while looking in the different directions, he mutters\n(Va _g_. S. IX, 22), 'Ours be your power, ours your manhood and intelligence\nours be your energies!' For he who offers the Va _g_ apeya wins everything\nhere, winning as he does Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati being everything\nhere;--having appropriated to himself the glory, the power, and the strength\nof this All, he now lays them within himself, makes them his own: that is why\nhe mutters, while looking in the different directions.\n\n5:2:1:1616\\. They throw up to him bags of salt; for salt means cattle, and\ncattle is food; and he who offers the [Va _g_ apeya](errata.htm#5) wins food,\nfor va _g_ a-peya is the same as anna-peya: thus whatever food he thereby has\ngained, therewith now that he has gone to the supreme goal, he puts himself in\ncontact, and makes it his own,--therefore they throw bags of salt up to him.\n\n5:2:1:1717\\. They (the pieces of salt) are done up in a _s_ vattha\n\np. 34\n\n[paragraph continues] (ficus religiosa) leaves: because Indra on that (former)\noccasion called upon the Maruts staying on the A _s_ vattha tree 1, therefore\nthey are done up in a _s_ vattha leaves. Peasants (vi _s_ ) throw them up to\nhim, for the Maruts are the peasants, and the peasants are food (for the\nnobleman): hence peasants throw them up. There are seventeen (bags), for Pra\n_g_ apati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra _g_ apati.\n\n5:2:1:1818\\. Thereupon; while looking down upon this (earth), he mutters,\nHomage be to the mother Earth! homage be to the mother Earth!' For when B _ri_\nhaspati had been consecrated, the Earth was afraid of him, thinking,\n'Something great surely has he become now that he has been consecrated: I fear\nlest he may rend me asunder 2!' And B _ri_ haspati also was afraid of the\nEarth, thinking, 'I fear lest she may shake me off!' Hence by that (formula)\nhe entered into a friendly relation with her; for a mother does not hurt her\nson, nor does a son hurt his mother.\n\n5:2:1:1919\\. Now the [B _ri_ haspati consecration](errata.htm#6) 3 is the same\nas the Va _g_ apeya; and the earth in truth is afraid of that (Sacrificer),\nthinking, 'Something great\n\np. 35\n\nsurely has he become now that he has been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend\nme asunder!' And he himself is afraid of her, thinking, 'I fear lest she may\nshake me off!' Hence he thereby enters into a friendly relation with her, for\na mother does not hurt her son; neither does a son hurt his mother.\n\n5:2:1:2020\\. He then descends (and treads) upon a piece of gold;--gold is\nimmortal life: he thus takes his stand on life immortal.\n\n5:2:1:2121\\. Now (in the first place) he (the Adhvaryu) spreads out the skin\nof a he-goat, and lays a (small) gold plate thereon: upon that--or indeed upon\nthis (earth) itself--he (the Sacrificer) steps.\n\n5:2:1:2222\\. They then bring a throne-seat for him; for truly he who gains a\nseat in the air 1, gains a seat above (others): thus these subjects of his sit\nbelow him who is seated above,--this is why they bring him a throne-seat.\n\n5:2:1:2323\\. It is made of udumbara wood,--the Udumbara tree being sustenance,\n(that is) food,--for his obtainment of sustenance, food: therefore it is made\nof udumbara wood. They set it down in front of the Havirdhana (cart-shed),\nbehind the \xc3\x82havaniya (fire).\n\n5:2:1:2424\\. He then spreads the goat-skin thereon; for truly the he-goat is\nno other than Pra _g_ apati, for they, the goats, are most clearly of Pra _g_\napati (the lord of generation or creatures);--whence, bringing forth thrice in\na year, they produce two or three 2: thus he thereby makes him (the\nSacrificer) to be Pra _g_ apati himself,--this is why he spreads the goat-skin\nthereon.\n\np. 36\n\n5:2:1:2525\\. He spreads it, with, 'This is thy kingship 1!' whereby he endows\nhim with royal power. He then makes him sit down, with, Thou art the ruler,\nthe ruling lord!' whereby he makes him the ruler, ruling over those subjects\nof his Thou art firm, and stedfast!' whereby he makes him firm and stedfast in\nthis world;--'Thee for the tilling!--Thee for peaceful dwelling!--Thee for\nwealth!--Thee for thrift!' whereby he means to say, '(here I seat) thee for\nthe welfare (of the people).'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[29:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_72) The term apti, literally 'obtainment, gain,' is\ntechnically used p. 30 for the twelve formulas, given in the next paragraph,\nas well as for the oblations made therewith. The first of these formulas is\n'apaye svaha,' whence the above term is probably derived.\n\n[30:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_73) Or perhaps, 'there is of (belongs to) that\n(sacrifice).'\n\n[30:2](sbe4108.htm#fr_74) This term, literally 'success, accomplishment,' is\ntechnically used to denote the succeeding formulas containing the verb 'k _li_\np,' to succeed, prosper, as well as the oblations made therewith.\n\n[31:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_75) For the ordinary mortar-shaped top-piece fixed on\nthe post. see-part ii, p. 168, note 1. On the present occasion it is to be\nmade of wheaten dough.\n\n[31:2](sbe4108.htm#fr_76) According to a legend given at III, 1, 2, 13 seq.,\nman had originally a (hairy) skin, or hide; but the gods having flayed him,\nput his skin on the cow.\n\n[31:3](sbe4108.htm#fr_77) In the ceremonial of the Black Ya _g_ us (Taitt. Br.\nI. 3, 7, 1) the Sacrificer himself has to put on a 'tarpya' garment, for which\nsee note on [V, 2, 5, 20](sbe4117.htm#5:3:5:20) (sic).\n\n[32:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_78) Viz. because her ordinary seat is at the back, or\nwest, end of the altar.\n\n[32:2](sbe4108.htm#fr_79) According to the ritual of the Black Ya _g_ us (Say.\non Taitt. S. I, 7, 9, vol. i, p. 1039), the Sacrificer, having ascended, lifts\nup his p. 33 arms to heaven, praying, 'We have gone to the light, to the gods,\nwe have become immortal; we have become Pra _g_ apati's children!'\n\n[34:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_80) See part ii, p. 334, with note 2. On the 'a _s_\nvattha devasadana' cp. also Ath.-veda V, 4, 3; Rig-veda I, 164, 20-22; A.\nKuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers and des Gottertranks, p. 126 seq. (Mythol. Stud.\ni. p. 112 seq.).\n\n[34:2](sbe4108.htm#fr_81) Or, 'I hope he will not rend me asunder.' For this\nconstruction--exactly corresponding to the German 'dass (or, wenn) er mich nur\nnicht aufreisst!' (cf. also the colloquial use of the French\n'pourvu,'--'pourvu qu'il ne me dechire pas!')--see part ii, p. 31, note 1.\n\n[34:3](sbe4108.htm#fr_82) The B _ri_ haspatisava is performed by a Brahma _n_\na with a view to obtaining the office of Purohita (royal chaplain, or family\npriest). For \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana's rule, which places it on a level with the Ra _g_\nasuya sacrifice of a king, see [p. 4](sbe4103.htm#page_4), note\n[1](sbe4103.htm#fn_33).\n\n[35:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_83) The Sacrificer is supposed to have done so by the,\nsymbolical act of raising his head above the sacrificial post; see paragraph\n14 above.\n\n[35:2](sbe4108.htm#fr_84) See IV, 5, 5, 6; part ii, p. 407, note 3.\n\n[36:1](sbe4108.htm#fr_85) Thus the formula 'iyam to ra _t_ ' is interpreted by\nMahidhara (who, however, takes it to be addressed to the throne-seat, and not,\nas would seem preferable, to the king), and apparently also by our author. The\nword 'ra _g_ ' would indeed seem to mean here something like the energy ( _s_\nakti), or the symbol, of the king. The St. Petersburg dictionary, however,\ntakes it here as the name of a female deity.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 2, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe4109.htm)\n\n"
