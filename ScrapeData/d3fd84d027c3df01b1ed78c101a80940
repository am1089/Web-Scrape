And on account of the declaration (of scripture).\n\nScripture moreover declares that the highest Brahman enters into the body and\nthe other limiting adjuncts, 'He made bodies with two feet, he made bodies\nwith four feet. Having first become a bird he entered the bodies as purusha'\n(B _ri_. Up. II, 5, 18); and 'Having entered into them with this living\n(individual) Self' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 3, 2).--For all these reasons the\ncomparison set forth in Sutra 18 is unobjectionable.\n\nSome teachers assume that the preceding discussion (beginning from Sutra 11)\ncomprises two adhikara _n_ as, of which the former discusses the question\nwhether Brahman is an absolutely uniform being in which all the plurality of\nthe apparent world vanishes, or a being multiform as the apparent world is;\nwhile the latter tries to determine\n\np. 160\n\nwhether Brahman--whose absolute uniformity was established in the former\nadhikara _n_ a--is to be defined as that which is (sat), or as thought\n(intelligence; bodha), or as both.--Against this we remark that in no case\nthere is a valid reason for beginning a second adhikara _n_ a. For what should\nbe the subject of a special second adhikara _n_ a? Sutra 15 and foll. cannot\nbe meant to disprove that Brahman possesses a plurality of characteristics;\nfor that hypothesis is already sufficiently disposed of in Sutras 11-14. Nor\ncan they be meant to show that Brahman is to be defined only as 'that which\nis,' not also as 'thought;' for that would imply that the scriptural passage,\n'consisting of nothing but knowledge' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 12), is devoid of\nmeaning. How moreover could Brahman, if devoid of intelligence, be said to be\nthe Self of the intelligent individual soul? Nor again can the hypothetical\nsecond adhikara _n_ a be assumed to prove that Brahman must be defined as\n'thought' only, not at the same time as 'that which is;' for if it were so,\ncertain scriptural passages--as e.g. Ka. Up. II, 6, 13, 'He is to be conceived\nby the words, He is'--would lose their meaning. And how, moreover, could we\nadmit thought apart from existence?--Nor can it be said that Brahman has both\nthose characteristics, since that would contradict something already admitted.\nFor he who would maintain that Brahman is characterised by thought different\nfrom existence, and at the same time by existence different from thought,\nwould virtually maintain that there is a plurality in Brahman, and that view\nhas already been disproved in the preceding adhikara _n_ a.--But as scripture\nteaches both (viz. that Brahman is one only and that it possesses more than\none characteristic) there can be no objection to such a doctrine!--There is,\nwe reply, for one being cannot possibly possess more than one nature.--And if\nit finally should be said that existence is thought and thought existence and\nthat the two do not exclude each other; we remark that in that case there is\nno reason for the doubt 1 whether Brahman is that which is, or intelligence,\n\np. 161\n\nor both.--On the other hand we have shown that the Sutras can be explained as\nconstituting one adhikara _n_ a only. Moreover, as the scriptural texts\nconcerning Brahman disagree in so far as representing Brahman as qualified by\nform and again as devoid of form we, when embracing the alternative of a\nBrahman devoid of form, must necessarily explain the position of the other\ntexts, and if taken in that sense the Sutras (15-21) acquire a more\nappropriate meaning. And if it is maintained that those scriptural passages\nalso which speak of Brahman as qualified by form have no separate meaning of\ntheir own, but likewise teach that Brahman is devoid of all form, viz. by\nintimating that the plurality referred to has to be annihilated; we reply that\nthis opinion also appears objectionable. In those cases, indeed, where\nelements of plurality are referred to in chapters treating of the highest\nknowledge, we may assume them to be mentioned merely to be abstracted from; so\ne.g. in the passage, B _ri_. Up. II, 5, 19, 'His horses are yoked hundreds and\nten. This is the horses, this is the ten and the thousands, many and endless,'\nwhich passage is immediately followed by the words, 'This is the Brahman\nwithout cause and without effect, without anything inside or outside.' But\nwhere elements of plurality are referred to in chapters treating of devout\nmeditation, we have no right to assume that they are mentioned only to be set\naside. This is the case e.g. in the passage, 'He who consists of mind, whose\nbody is pra _n_ a, whose form is light' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 2), which is\nconnected with an injunction of devout meditation contained in the preceding\npassage, 'Let him have this will and belief.' In passages of the latter kind,\nwhere the determinations attributed to Brahman may be taken as they stand and\nviewed as subserving the purposes of devout meditation, we have no right to\nassume that they are mentioned with the indirect purpose of being discarded.\nMoreover, if all texts concerning Brahman equally aimed at discarding all\nthought of plurality, there would be no opportunity for stating the\ndeterminative reason (why Brahman is to be viewed as devoid of all form) as\nwas done in Sutra 14. And further scripture\n\np. 162\n\ninforms us that devout meditations on Brahman as characterised by form have\nresults of their own, viz. either the warding off of calamities, or the\ngaining of power, or else release by successive steps. All these reasons\ndetermine us to view the passages concerning devout meditation on the one hand\nand the passages concerning Brahman on the other hand as constituting separate\nclasses, not as forming one whole. In what way moreover, we ask, could the two\nclasses of texts be looked upon as constituting one whole?--Our opponent will\nperhaps reply, 'Because we apprehend them to form parts of one injunction,\njust as we do in the case of the dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa-sacrifice and the\noblations called praya _g_ as.'--But this reply we are unable to admit, since\nthe texts about Brahman, as shown at length under I, 1, 4, merely determine an\nexisting substance (viz. Brahman), and do not enjoin any performances. What\nkind of activity, we moreover ask, are those texts, according to our\nopponent's view, meant to enjoin? For whenever an injunction is laid upon a\nperson, it has reference to some kind of work to be undertaken by him.--Our\nopponent will perhaps make the following reply. The object of the injunction\nis in the present case, the annihilation of the appearance of duality. As long\nas the latter is not destroyed, the true nature of Brahman is not known; hence\nthe appearance of duality which stands in the way of true knowledge must be\ndissolved. Just as the Veda prescribes the performance of certain sacrifices\nto him who is desirous of the heavenly world, so it prescribes the dissolution\nof the apparent world to him who is desirous of final release. Whoever wants\nto know the true nature of Brahman must first annihilate the appearance of\nplurality that obstructs true knowledge, just as a man wishing to ascertain\nthe true nature of some jar or similar object placed in a dark room must at\nfirst remove the darkness. For the apparent world has Brahman for its true\nnature, not vice versa; therefore the cognition of Brahman is effected through\nthe previous annihilation of the apparent world of names and forms.\n\nThis argumentation we meet by asking our opponent\n\np. 163\n\nof what nature that so-called annihilation of the apparent world is. Is it\nanalogous to the annihilation of hardness in butter which is effected by\nbringing it into contact with fire? or is the apparent world of names and\nforms which is superimposed upon Brahman by Nescience to be dissolved by\nknowledge, just as the phenomenon of a double moon which is due to a disease\nof the eyes is removed by the application of medicine 1? If the former, the\nVedic injunctions bid us to do something impossible; for no man can actually\nannihilate this whole existing world with all its animated bodies and all its\nelementary substances such as earth and so on. And if it actually could be\ndone, the first released person would have done it once for all, so that at\npresent the whole world would be empty, earth and all other substances having\nbeen finally annihilated.--If the latter, i.e. if our opponent maintains that\nthe phenomenal world is superimposed upon Brahman by Nescience and annihilated\nby knowledge, we point out that the only thing needed is that the knowledge of\nBrahman should be conveyed by Vedic passages sublating the apparent plurality\nsuperimposed upon Brahman by Nescience, such as 'Brahman is one, without a\nsecond;' 'That is the true, it is the Self and thou art it.' ( _Kh_. Up. VI,\n2, 1; 8, 7.) As soon as Brahman is indicated in this way, knowledge arising of\nitself discards Nescience, and this whole world of names and forms, which had\nbeen hiding Brahman from us, melts away like the imagery of a dream. As long,\non the other hand, as Brahman is not so indicated, you may say a hundred\ntimes, 'Cognize Brahman! Dissolve this world!' and yet we shall be unable to\ndo either the one or the other.\n\nBut, our opponent may object, even after Brahman has been indicated by means\nof the passages quoted, there is room for injunctions bidding us either to\ncognize Brahman or to dissolve the world.--Not so, we reply; for both these\n\np. 164\n\nthings are already effected by the indication of the true nature of Brahman as\ndevoid of all plurality; just as the pointing out of the true nature of the\nrope has for its immediate result the cognition of the true nature of the\nrope, and the dissolution of the appearance of a snake or the like. And what\nis done once need not be done again 1.--We moreover ask the following\nquestion: Does the individual soul on which the injunction is laid belong to\nthe unreal element of the phenomenal world or to the real element, i.e.\nBrahman, which underlies the phenomenal world? If the former, the soul itself\nis dissolved just as earth and the other elements are, as soon as the\nknowledge of Brahman's true nature has arisen, and on whom then should the\ndissolution of the world be enjoined, or who should, by acting on that\ninjunction, obtain release?--If the latter, we are led to the same result. For\nas soon as there arises the knowledge that Brahman, which never can become the\nsubject of an injunction, is the true being of the soul while the soul as such\nis due to Nescience, there remains no being on which injunctions could be\nlaid, and hence there is no room for injunctions at all.\n\nWhat then, it may be asked, is the meaning of those Vedic passages which speak\nof the highest Brahman as something to be seen, to be heard, and so on?--They\naim, we reply, not at enjoining the knowledge of truth, but merely at\ndirecting our attention to it. Similarly in ordinary life imperative phrases\nsuch as 'Listen to this!' 'Look at this!' are frequently meant to express not\nthat we are immediately to cognize this or that, but only that we are to\ndirect our attention to it. Even when a person is face to face with some\nobject of knowledge, knowledge may either arise or not; all that another\nperson wishing to inform him about the object can do is to point it out to\nhim; knowledge will thereupon spring up in his mind of itself, according to\nthe object of knowledge and according\n\np. 165\n\nto the means of knowledge employed.--Nor must it be said that an injunction\nmay have the purpose of modifying the knowledge of a thing which was\noriginally obtained by some other means of knowledge 1. For the modified\nknowledge due to such injunctions is not knowledge in the true sense of the\nword, but merely a mental energy (i.e. the product, not of an object of\nknowledge presented to us through one of the means of true knowledge, but of\nan arbitrary mental activity), and if such modification of knowledge springs\nup in the mind of itself (i.e. without a deliberate mental act) it is mere\nerror. True knowledge on the other hand, which is produced by the means of\ntrue knowledge and is conformable to its object, can neither be brought about\nby hundreds of injunctions nor be checked by hundreds of prohibitions. For it\ndoes not depend on the will of man, but merely on what really and unalterably\nexists.--For this reason also injunctions of the knowledge of Brahman cannot\nbe admitted.\n\nA further point has to be considered here. If we admitted that injunctions\nconstitute the sole end and aim of the entire Veda, there would remain no\nauthority for the, after all, generally acknowledged truth that Brahman--which\nis not subject to any injunction--is the Self of all.--Nor would it be of\navail to maintain that the Veda may both proclaim the truth stated just now\nand enjoin on man the cognition of that truth; for that would involve the\nconclusion that the one Brahma- _s_ astra has two--and moreover conflicting--\nmeanings.--The theory combated by us gives moreover rise to a number of other\nobjections which nobody can refute; it compels us to set aside the text as it\nstands and to make assumptions not guaranteed by the text; it implies the\ndoctrine that final release is, like the results of sacrificial works, (not\nthe direct result of true knowledge but) the mediate result of the so-called\nunseen\n\np. 166\n\nprinciple (ad _ri_ sh _t_ a), and non-permanent &c. &c.--We therefore again\nassert that the texts concerning Brahman aim at cognition, not at injunction,\nand that hence the pretended reason of 'their being apprehended as parts of\none injunction' cannot induce us to look upon the entire Veda as one whole.\n\nAnd finally, even if we admitted that the texts concerning Brahman are of an\ninjunctive character, we should be unable to prove that the texts denying\nplurality, and the texts setting forth plurality enjoin one and the same\nthing; for this latter conclusion cannot be accepted in the face of the\nseveral means of proof such as difference of terms 1, and so on, which\nintimate that there is a plurality of injunctions. The passages respectively\nenjoining the dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa-sacrifice and the offerings termed praya\n_g_ as may indeed be considered to form one whole, as the qualification on the\npart of the sacrificer furnishes an element common to the two 2. But the\nstatements about the Brahman devoid of qualities and those about the qualified\nBrahman have not any element in common; for qualities such as 'having light\nfor one's body' contribute in no way towards the dissolution of the world, nor\nagain does the latter help in any way the former. For the dissolution of the\nentire phenomenal world on the one hand, and regard for a part of that world\non the other hand do not allow themselves to be combined in one and the same\nsubject.--The preferable theory, therefore, is to distinguish with us two\nclasses of texts, according as Brahman is represented as possessing form or as\ndevoid of it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[160:1](sbe38124.htm#fr_113) And hence no reason for a separate adhikara _n_\na.\n\n[163:1](sbe38124.htm#fr_114) i.e. does the injunction bidding us to annihilate\nthe phenomenal world look on it as real or as fictitious, due to Nescience\nonly?\n\n[164:1](sbe38124.htm#fr_115) I.e. after the true nature of Brahman has been\nonce known, there is no longer room for a special injunction to annihilate\nthis apparent world.\n\n[165:1](sbe38124.htm#fr_116) The purvapakshin might refer e.g. to the Vedic\ninjunction, 'he is to meditate upon woman as fire,' and maintain that the\nobject of this injunction is to modify our knowledge of woman derived from\nperception &c., according to which a woman is not fire.\n\n[166:1](sbe38124.htm#fr_117) 'Difference of terms' ( _s_ abdantaram) is\naccording to the Purva Mima _m_ sa the first of the six means of proof showing\nkarmabheda or niyogabheda.
