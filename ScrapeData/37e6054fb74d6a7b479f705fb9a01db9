Shree Krishnu Chund having thus\nspoken, took the cowherds\' children with him again to engage in sports. And\nwhilst Krishnu was absent in the jungle, grazing the cows, the cowherdesses\nremained in their houses, singing his praises. One day Shree Krishnu played on\nthe flute in the jungle: and, on hearing the sound of the flute, all the women\nof Bruj stood up in a state of agitation; and, having assembled in one place,\nsat down on the road they began to say to each other, "Our eyes will then be\nfully gratified when we behold Krishnu; he is now with the cows in the jungle,\ndancing and singing, in the evening he will return, and then we shall see\nhim." On hearing this a cowherdess said, "Hear me friend! he has played upon\nthe flute, and behold what greatness he has conferred upon the bamboo!"\n\n"What excellent qualities has it, that Shree Krishnu\'s mouth should be\nfastened to it all day long. And having drank the nectar of his lips, and\nraining forth joy, (it) the flute emits sounds like the clouds?\n\n"What, is it more beloved than ourselves, that Krishnu keeps it near him day\nand night?\n\n"It was made in our presence, and has now become a rival to us, being\nconstantly on his person.\n\np. 74\n\n"When Shree Krishnu, having wiped the flute with a yellow silk cloth, plays\nupon it, the gods, sages, celestial choristers and musicians taking their\nwives with them and seated in their chariots, come eagerly to hear him, and\nbeing fascinated by hearing him, they become fixed and motionless as pictures.\nWhat penance has the flute performed, that all are so subservient to it?"\n\nAnother cowherdess said in reply, "Having first of all been produced in the\nstock of the bamboo, the flute kept Huri in constant remembrance. Afterwards\nit endured heat, cold and rain. Suddenly, being broken up into small pieces,\nit burnt its body in fire and inhaled smoke.\n\n"This is the penance it has performed, by means of which it has become\ncomplete, and obtained this result (fruit)."\n\nHaving heard this, one of the Bruj women said, "Why has the lord of Bruj not\nformed us into flutes, that we might stay with Huri day and night?" Having\nnarrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja Pureechit,--O great\nking! the cowherdesses constantly sung the praises of Krishnu, until his\nreturn from grazing the cows in the jungles.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXIII](psa24.htm)\n\n'
