And there is need of all (works), on account of the scriptural statement\nof sacrifices and the like; as in the case of the horse.\n\nWe now consider whether knowledge has absolutely no need of the works enjoined\non the different a _s_ ramas, or whether it has some need of them. Under the\npreceding Sutra we have arrived at the conclusion that as knowledge effects\nits own end the works enjoined on the a _s_ ramas are absolutely not required.\nWith reference to this point the present Sutra now remarks that knowledge has\nregard\n\np. 307\n\nfor all works enjoined on the a _s_ ramas, and that there is not absolute non-\nregard.--But do not the two Sutras thus contradict each other?--By no means,\nwe reply. Knowledge having once sprung up requires no help towards the\naccomplishment of its fruit, but it does stand in need of something else with\na view to its own origination.--Why so?--On account of the scriptural\nstatements of sacrifices and so on. For the passage, 'Him Brahma _n_ as seek\nto know by the study of the Veda, by sacrifice, by gifts, by penance, by\nfasting' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22), declares that sacrifices and so on are means\nof knowledge, and as the text connects them with the 'seeking to know,' we\nconclude that they are, more especially, means of the origination of\nknowledge. Similarly the passage, 'What people call sacrifice that is really\nbrahma _k_ arya' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 5, i). by connecting sacrifices and so on\nwith brahma _k_ arya which is a means of knowledge, intimates that sacrifices\n&c. also are means of knowledge. Again the passage, 'That word which all the\nVedas record, which all penances proclaim, desiring which men live as\nreligious students, that word I tell thee briefly, it is Om' (Ka. Up. I, 2,\n15), likewise intimates that the works enjoined on the a _s_ ramas are means\nof knowledge. Similarly Sm _ri_ ti says, 'Works are the washing away of\nuncleanliness, but knowledge is the highest way. When the impurity has been\nremoved, then knowledge begins to act.'\n\nThe phrase, 'as in the case of the horse,' supplies an illustration on the\nground of suitability. As the horse, owing to its specific suitability, is not\nemployed for dragging ploughs but is harnessed to chariots; so the works\nenjoined on the a _s_ ramas are not required by knowledge for bringing about\nits results, but with a view to its own origination.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 27](sbe38236.htm)\n\n"
