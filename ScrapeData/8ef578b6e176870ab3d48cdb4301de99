Verily the Upasads (homages or sieges) are the neck of the\nsacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head. Hence when it is performed with the\nPravargya 3,\n\np. 105\n\nthey perform the Upasads 1 after performing the Pravargya, and thereby they\nput the neck in its place.\n\n3:4:4:22\\. The anuvakyas (invitatory prayers) in the forenoon are the ya _g_\nyas (offering prayers) in the afternoon; and the ya _g_ yas are the anuvakyas\n2. He thus interlinks them, whence those joints and those bones of the neck\nare interlinked.\n\n3:4:4:33\\. Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_\napati, were contending against each other 3. The Asuras then built themselves\ncastles in these worlds,--an iron one in this world, a silver one in the air,\nand a golden one in the sky.\n\n3:4:4:44\\. The gods then prevailed. They besieged them by these sieges\n(upasad); and because they besieged (upa-sad) them, therefore the name\nUpasads.\n\np. 106\n\n[paragraph continues] They clove the castles and conquered these worlds. Hence\nthey say, 'A castle is conquered by siege;' for it is indeed by beleaguering\nthat one of these human castles is taken.\n\n3:4:4:55\\. By means of these sieges, then, the gods clove the castles and\nconquered these worlds. And so does this one (the sacrificer) now,--no one, it\nis true, builds for himself castles against him in this world; he cleaves\nthese same worlds, he conquers these worlds: therefore he offers with the\nUpasads.\n\n3:4:4:66\\. They have clarified butter for their offering material. For ghee is\na thunderbolt, and by that thunderbolt, the ghee, the gods clove the\nstrongholds and conquered these worlds. And so does he cleave these worlds by\nthat thunderbolt, the ghee, and conquer these worlds; therefore they (the\nUpasads) have ghee for their offering material.\n\n3:4:4:77\\. He takes eight times (ghee) in the _g_ uhu, and four times in the\nupabh _ri_ t; or conversely, they say, he is to take of it only four times in\nthe _g_ uhu and eight times in the upabh _ri_ t 1.\n\n3:4:4:88\\. He takes eight times in the _g_ uhu, and four times in the upabh\n_ri_ t. He thereby makes the thunderbolt heavy in front, and with that\nthunderbolt heavy in front he cleaves these worlds, and conquers these worlds.\n\n3:4:4:99\\. Agni and Soma verily are yoke-fellows among the gods: for these two\nhe takes (ghee) in common 2. For Vish _n_ u (he takes) singly. He makes only\nthe one libation (aghara) which (he makes) with the dipping-spoon (sruva) 3.\nFor when he has made\n\np. 107\n\nthe northern (higher) libation he retires 1: 'May I conquer for conquest' so\nhe thinks, and therefore he makes only the one libation, that with the\ndipping-spoon.\n\n3:4:4:1010\\. When he has called on the \xc3\x82gnidhra) for the _S_ rausha _t_ ,-- he\ndoes not elect the Hot _ri_  2. 'Seat thee, O Hot _ri_!' he says. The Hot _ri_\nsits down on the Hot _ri_ 's seat. Having sat down he urges the Adhvaryu; and\nhe, thus urged, takes the two offering-spoons 3.\n\n3:4:4:1111\\. While passing over (to the south side of the fire and altar) he\nsays 4 (to the Hot _ri_ ), 'Recite the invitatory prayer to Agni!' and having\ncalled for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer to\nAgni!' and pours out the oblation when the Vasha _t_ is uttered.\n\n3:4:4:1212\\. Thereupon he says, 'Recite the invitatory prayer to Soma!' and\nhaving called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer\nto Soma!' and pours out the oblation when the Vasha _t_ is uttered.\n\n3:4:4:1313\\. Thereupon, while pouring the ghee which is in the upabh _ri_ t 5,\ntogether (with what is left in the guhu), he says, 'Recite the invitatory\nprayer to Vish _n_ u!' and, having called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says,\n'Pronounce the offering prayer to Vish _n_ u!'\n\np. 108\n\nand pours out the oblation when the Vasha _t_ is uttered.\n\n3:4:4:1414\\. The reason why in offering he remains standing in one and the\nsame place, and does not move about as he is wont to do here in performing, is\nthat he thinks 'I will conquer for conquest 1!' And the reason why he offers\nto those deities is that he thereby constructs the thunderbolt: Agni (he\nmakes) the point (anika), Soma the barb ( _s_ alya), and Vish _n_ u the\nconnecting piece (kulmala) 2.\n\n3:4:4:1515\\. For the thunderbolt is the year the day is Agni, the night Soma,\nand what is between the two, that is Vish _n_ u. Thus he makes the revolving\nyear.\n\n3:4:4:1616\\. The thunderbolt is the year: by that year, as a thunderbolt, the\ngods clove the strongholds and conquered these worlds. And so does he now by\nthat year, as a thunderbolt, cleave these worlds, and conquer these worlds.\nThis is why he offers to those gods.\n\n3:4:4:1717\\. Let him undertake three Upasads; for, there being three seasons\nin the year, it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the\nyear. He performs twice each.\n\np. 109\n\n3:4:4:1818\\. These amount to six; for, there being six seasons in the year, it\nis thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the year.\n\n3:4:4:1919\\. And should he undertake twelve Upasads,--there being twelve\nmonths in the year, it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes\nup the year. He performs twice each.\n\n3:4:4:2020\\. These amount to twenty-four;--there being twenty-four half-moons\nin the year, it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the\nyear.\n\n3:4:4:2121\\. As to his performing in the evening and in the morning,--it is\nbecause only thus completeness is obtained. When he performs in the forenoon,\nthen he gains the victory;--and when he performs in the afternoon, he does so\nthat it may be a good (complete) victory;--and when he offers the Homa, (it is\nas if) people fight here for a stronghold, and having conquered it, they enter\nit as their own.\n\n3:4:4:2222\\. When he performs (the upasads), he fights; and when (the\nperformance) is completed, he conquers; and when he offers the Homa 1, he\nenters that (stronghold) now his own.\n\n3:4:4:2323\\. He offers it (with the verse) with which he\n\np. 110\n\nwill have to perform twice in one day 1 (Va _g_. S. V, 8), 'What most\nexcellent iron-clad body is thine, O Agni, established in the deep, it hath\nchased away the cruel word, it hath chased away the fearful word; Hail!' for\nsuch-like it was, it was indeed iron.\n\n3:4:4:2424\\. Again he offers (with the verse) with which he will have to\nperform twice in one day, 'What most excellent silver-clad body is thine, O\nAgni, established in the deep, it hath chased away the cruel word, it hath\nchased away the fearful word; Hail!' for such-like it was, it was indeed\nsilver.\n\n3:4:4:2525\\. And again he offers (with the verse) with which he will have to\nperform twice in one day, 'What most excellent gold-clad body is thine, O\nAgni, established in the deep, it hath chased away the cruel word, it hath\nchased away the fearful word; Hail!' for such-like it was, it was indeed\ngolden. If he undertakes twelve Upasads, let him perform each of them for four\ndays.\n\n3:4:4:2626\\. Now then of the fast-homages. Some Upasads get wider and wider,\nothers narrower and narrower: those at which he milks out one (teat) 2 on the\nfirst day, then two, and then three, are those that get wider and wider; and\nthose at which he\n\np. 111\n\nmilks out three on the first day, then two, and then one, are those that get\nnarrower and narrower. Those getting narrower and narrower are (as good as)\nthose getting wider and wider; and those getting wider and wider are (as good\nas) those getting narrower and narrower.\n\n3:4:4:2727\\. Verily, the world is conquered by austere devotion. Now, his\ndevotion becomes ever and ever wider, he conquers an ever and ever more\nglorious world and becomes better even in this world, whosoever, knowing this,\nundertakes the Upasads that get narrower and narrower 1: let him, therefore,\nundertake the Upasads that get narrower and narrower. And should he undertake\ntwelve Upasads, let him have three (teats) milked out for four days, two for\nfour days, and one for four days.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[104:3](sbe2618.htm#fr_273) The Pravargya, an offering of heated milk, which\nprecedes each performance of the Upasads,--except at the first performance of\nthe Soma-sacrifice, when it is prohibited by many authorities,--seems\noriginally to have been an independent ceremony, and as such it is treated by\nmost ritualistic books apart from the exposition of the Soma-cult. The _S_\natapatha-brahma _n_ a deals with it in XIV, 1-3 (Va _g_. S. XXXIX). Its mystic\nsignificance appears to have been that of supplying the sacrificer with a new\ncelestial body. There seems to have been a tendency towards exalting its p.\n105 importance--if not, indeed, towards making it take the place of the Soma-\ncult. The hot milk (gharma) is even styled 'Samra _g_ ' or supreme king--as\nagainst the title 'ra _g_ an' or king, assigned to Soma; and a throne is\nprovided for it, just as for the latter. The rules for its performance,\naccording to the \xc3\x82pastamba _S_ rauta-sutra, have been published, with a\ntranslation, by Professor Garbe (Zeitsch. der D. M. G. XXXIV, p. 319 seq.).\nSee also Haug's Transl. of the Ait. Br. pp. 41-43; Weber, Ind. Stud. IX. pp.\n218-220.\n\n[105:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_274) The Upasada _h_ , consisting of three offerings of\nghee to Agni, Soma, and Vish _n_ u, followed by a Homa, have to be performed\ntwice daily, for at least three days (the normal number at the Agnish _t_\noma). The first day's performance is called (from the corresponding Homa) the\n'aya _h_ _s_ aya' (lying in iron, made of iron), the second day's 'ra _g_ a\n_h_ _s_ aya' (silvern),and the third day's 'hari _s_ aya' (golden). If there\nare six, or twelve Upasad days, each of the three varieties of performance has\nassigned to it an equal number of successive days; and if there are more than\ntwelve the three varieties are to be performed alternately.\n\n[105:2](sbe2618.htm#fr_275) For the anuvakyas and ya _g_ yas, as well as the\nkindling-verses (samidhenis) to be recited at the Upasads, see Ait. Br. I, 26;\n\xc3\x82 _s_ v. IV, 8.\n\n[105:3](sbe2618.htm#fr_276) For other versions of this myth, see Ait. Br. I,\n23; Taitt. S. VI, 2, 3.\n\n[106:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_277) This would be the regular mode of ladling. See 1,\n3, 2, 8 seq.\n\n[106:2](sbe2618.htm#fr_278) See p. 108, note 1.\n\n[106:3](sbe2618.htm#fr_279) For the two aghara, or libations of ghee, made\nwith the p. 107 sruva north of the fire and _g_ uhu south of the fire\nrespectively, see I, 4, 4, 1 seq. At the Upasad-ish _t_ i neither fore-\nofferings (praya _g_ a) nor after-offerings (anuya _g_ a) are performed.\n\n[107:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_280) Viz. to the offering place on the south side of\nthe fire. The covert meaning is that, were he to make the second libation, he\nwould have to recede front the higher (uttara, northern) position already\ngained.\n\n[107:2](sbe2618.htm#fr_281) See I, 5, 1, 1 seq.\n\n[107:3](sbe2618.htm#fr_282) See I, 5, 2, 1 seq.\n\n[107:4](sbe2618.htm#fr_283) See I, 7, 2, 1 seq.\n\n[107:5](sbe2618.htm#fr_284) Of the ghee in the _g_ uhu (obtained from eight\nladlings with the p. 108 sruva) he first offers one half each to Agni and\nSoma. Thereupon he pours the ghee from the upabh _ri_ t (obtained from four\nladlings with the sruva) into the _g_ uhu and offers it to Vish _n_ u.\n\n[108:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_285) 'It is for conquest that he does not move about as\nhe (does when he) performs here in any other sacrifice.' Ka _n_ va recension.\n\n[108:2](sbe2618.htm#fr_286) ? The socket; compare Ait. Br. I, 25, 'The gods\nconstructed that arrow, the Upasads: Agni was its point (? anika, shaft,\nHaug), Soma its barb ( _s_ alya, steel, H.), Vish _n_ u its shaft (te _g_\nanam, point, H.), and Varu _n_ a its feathers (par _n_ a) . . . . For the\narrow consists of three parts, anika, _s_ alya, and te _g_ ana . . . . For the\narrow consists of two parts, _s_ alya and te _g_ ana.' Here _s_ alya would\nseem to be the barbed head-piece (with the point, anika), and te _g_ ana the\nshaft or reed of the arrow.\n\n[109:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_287) On the completion of each performance of the\nUpasad offerings, after the anointing of the prastara (see I, 8, 3, 11-14) and\npreviously to taking up the enclosing-sticks (ib. 22), a homa (or _g_ uhoti)\noffering (part i, p. 263, note 2), called Upasad-homa, has to be performed\nwith the dipping-spoon; the sacrificer holding on to Adhvaryu from behind,\nwhile the ghee is poured into the fire. Its performance over, the Upasads are\nbrought to an end by a repetition of the ceremony with the prastara (which is\nnot burnt) described above, [III, 4, 3, 22](sbe2617.htm#3:4:3:22), and the\nminor concluding ceremonies (I, 8, 3, 23 seq.; 9, 2, 19 seq.); whereupon the\nSubrahma _n_ ya litany ([III, 3, 4, 17](sbe2614.htm#3:3:4:17)) is recited.\n\n[110:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_288) While the Hot _ri_ , as we saw ([parag.\n2](sbe2618.htm#3:4:4:2), above), uses the same two verses twice in one day,\nviz. one for the anuvakya in the morning and for the ya _g_ ya in the\nafternoon; and the other for the ya _g_ ya in the morning and for the anuvakya\nin the evening,--the Adhvaryu is to use the three formulas here mentioned on\nthe three Upasad days respectively, both at the morning and afternoon\nperformances.\n\n[110:2](sbe2618.htm#fr_289) Viz. of the vratadugha, or cow supplying his fast-\nmilk. The milk so obtained is to be his only food during the Upasad days.\n\n[111:1](sbe2618.htm#fr_290) The simile is apparently taken from the arrow,\nwhich pierces the deeper the more pointed it is; cf. [parag.\n14](sbe2618.htm#3:4:4:14), above; Ait. Br. I, 25. Also Taitt. S. VI, 2, 3, 5,\nwhere a goad (ara?) is compared.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 5, 1. Fifth Adhyaya.
