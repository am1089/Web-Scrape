"The\nYoga we practice, is not for ourselves alone, but for humanity. Its object is\nnot personal Mukti (liberation), although Mukti is a necessary condition of\nthe Yoga, but the libration of the human race. It is not personal ananda\n(bliss), but the bringing down of the divine Ananda--Christ\'s Kingdom of\nHeaven, our Satyayuga upon the earth".--\n\n--An excerpt from "The Yoga and Its Objects".\n\n"Humanity is evolving. Yoga is the means of carrying that evolution forward\nwith great and victorious rapidity", "Yogic Sadhan".\n\n"The goal marked out for us is not to speculate about these things but to\nexperience them. The call upon us is to grow into the image of God, to dwell\nin Him and with\n\np. 16\n\n[paragraph continues] Him and be a channel of His joy and might and an\ninstrument of His works. Purified from all that is Asubha (evil), transfigured\nin soul by His touch we have to act in the world as dynamos of that divine\nelectricity and send it thrilling and radiating thru mankind, so that wherever\none of us stands, hundreds around may become full of His light and force, full\nof God and full of Ananda (the bliss of the spirit). Churches, orders,\ntheologies, philosophies have failed to save mankind because they have busied\nthemselves with intellectual creeds, dogmas, rites and institutions, with\nachara sudhi and darshana, as if these could save mankind, and have neglected\nthe one thing needful, the power and purification of the soul. We must go back\nto the one thing needful, take-up again Christ\'s Gospel of the purity and\nperfection of mankind, Mahomed\'s gospel of perfect submission, self-surrender\nand servitude of God, Chaitanya\'s gospel of the perfect love and joy of God in\nman, Ramkrishna\'s gospel of the unity of all religions and the divinity of God\nin man, and gathering all these streams into one mighty river, one purifying\nand redeeming Ganges, pour it over the death-in-life of a\n\np. 17\n\nmaterialistic humanity as Bhagiratha led down the Ganges and flooded with it\nthe ashes of his fathers, so that there may be a resurrection of the soul in\nmankind and the Satya yuga for a while returns to the world. Nor is this the\nwhole object of the Lila or the Yoga, the reason for which the Avatars descend\nis to raise up man again and again, developing in him a higher and ever\nhigher-humanity, a greater and yet greater development of divine being,\nbringing more and more of heaven again and again upon the earth until our toil\nis done. Our work accomplished and Sachchidananda fulfilled in all even here,\neven in this material universe. Small is his work, even if he succeeds, who\nlabours for his own salvation or the salvation of a few, infinitely great is\nhe even if he fail or succeed only partially or for a season, who lives only\nto bring about peace of soul, joy, purity and perfection among all mankind."\n\n[Excerpt](errata.htm#3) from the "Yoga and Its Objects" by a Master.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Location of Kundalini](kmu05.htm)\n\n'
