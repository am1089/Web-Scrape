Vyasa said :-- The king Sudars\xc2\x92ana, surrounded by his friends, on coming\nto the palace at Ayodhya, bowed down to Lilavati, the mother of S\xc2\x92atrujit, and\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O mother! I swear by touching your feet, that I have not killed in\nbattle your son S\xc2\x92atrujit nor your father Yudhajit; it is the Devi Durga that\nhas killed them; I am not to be blamed a bit in this. O mother! You need not\nbe sensitive in this; there is no remedy for what will inevitably come to\npass; therefore you do not be sorry for the death of your son; you must know\nthat the Jivas enjoy pleasure and pain as the results of their own Karmas.\n\n\n\n5\\. O mother! I am your servant; you are entitled to the same respect and\nworship as Manorama, my own mother; there is no difference whatsoever between\nher and you.\n\n\n\np. 222\n\n\n\n6\\. O mother! One must bear the effects of one\xc2\x92s Karma, good or bad; therefore\nwhen pleasure or pain arises, you should not be glad or otherwise.\n\n\n\n7\\. When pain arises, more pain is said to be conceived and when pleasure\narises, more pleasure is seen. But the learned say that man ought not to\nsubject himself to excessive pleasure or pain.\n\n\n\n8\\. O mother! This whole world is under Fate, Destiny; nothing of it is yours.\nTherefore the intelligent persons ought not to grieve their hearts at any time\nwith sorrow.\n\n\n\n9\\. As the wooden dolls dance in a stage as danced by the actor, so the\nindividual souls here work as the results of their past Karmas; there is no\ndoubt in this.\n\n\n\n10\\. O mother! I know that the effect of one\xc2\x92s own Karma, must have to be\nborne; it is, on that account, that I never felt sorrow in my exile in the\nforest.\n\n\n\n11\\. You are quite aware that my mother\xc2\x92s father was killed here, and my\nmother, becoming very much afraid and sorrowful, took me and escaped to the\nforest.\n\n\n\n12-13. The robbers robbed us of everything save our clothes on our bodies; I\nwas then very young; my mother was without any shelter; she carried me with\nthis minister Vidalla and my helpless nurse to the hermitage of Bharadvaja.\n\n\n\n14\\. There the kind hermit and his wife and the other wives of the hermits\nprotected our lives in that forest, with the roots and fruits, that can be\nobtained there in that forest. Thus our time passed.\n\n\n\n15\\. Mother! I had felt no pain then; nor do I feel any pleasure at present,\nwhen wealth is flowing unto me. What more to say, I have no feeling of\njealousy or envy whatsoever in my mind.\n\n\n\n16\\. O mother! Rather it is better, in my eyes, to subsist on roots and fruits\nthan to enjoy kingdoms; for the kings go to hell; but the ascetics living on\nroots and fruits never meet with that result.\n\n\n\n17\\. The wise should undoubtedly practice Dharma and control their passions\nand thus save themselves from being led into hells.\n\n\n\n18-19. O mother! The human birth in this auspicious Bharatvar _s_ a is seldom\nobtained. The enjoyments in eating and drinking are possible in every womb,\nbut it is highly incumbent on us when we have got the privilege of this human\nbirth, to earn Dharma, leading to the Heavens and salvation which can be very\nrarely attained in being born in other wombs.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 223\n\n\n\n20-21. Vyasa said :-- When Sudars\xc2\x92ana had told thus, Lilavati became very\nabashed; she cast aside the sorrow for the death of her son, told him with\ntears in her eyes :-- \xc2\x93O my son Sudars\xc2\x92ana! I am very much guilty on account\nof my father Yudhajit killing your mother\xc2\x92s father and taking hold of the\nsovereignty of this kingdom.\n\n\n\n22\\. I could not then hinder my father and son; whatever unlawful evil and\ncruel deeds were then committed, all were done by my father Yudhajit.\nTherefore, my child, I am not to be made guilty in any way in these doings.\n\n\n\n23\\. Both my father and son were killed out of the wickedness of their own\nactions; how can you account for those wicked things? Child! I am not\nexpressing sorrow at the death of my son; I have been pained by his doings.\n\n\n\n24-25. O noble souled one; You are my son; Manorama is my sister; Child! I am\nnot at all offended with you nor am I the least sorry for your obtaining the\nkingdom; Child! you are very fortunate; therefore you have obtained, by the\ngrace of Bhagavati, this kingdom without any enemies; now rule your subjects\naccording to the prescribed rules of Dharma.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n26-28. Vyasa said :-- O king! The king Sudars\xc2\x92ana heard Lilavati and bowed\ndown at her feet. Then he went to the beautiful palace where Manorama had\npreviously gone and began to live there. Inviting the ministers and the\nastrologers, he asked them what was the auspicious day and the auspicious\nmoment, that he can establish Durga Devi on a beautiful golden throne and he\nwould worship Her.\n\n\n\n29\\. \xc2\x93O ministers! First I will install on the throne the Devi, the Awarder of\nthe four main objects of human pursuits (viz. virtue, wealth, enjoyment and\nfinal beatitude) and then I will govern my kingdom like the kings S\xc2\x92ri Rama\nChandra and others.\n\n\n\n30\\. All the people of this city of Ayodhya ought also to worship this\nAuspicious S\xc2\x92akti, the Highest Energy, the Giver of all desires and Siddhis,\nand that is respected and adored by all.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n31\\. The ministers, on hearing his words, had a beautiful palace built by the\nengineers, artists and workmen and proclaimed in the city the king\xc2\x92s\nproclamation.\n\n\n\n32\\. Then the king Sudars\xc2\x92ana had an image of the Devi nicely built and got\nthat installed with the help of the Pundits, versed in the Vedas, on an\nauspicious day and at an auspicious moment.\n\n\n\np. 224\n\n\n\n33\\. The intelligent king performed the worship and Homa ceremony, according\nto the prescribed rules, and thus finally settled the ceremony of invocation\nof the Deity into the new image and established it as an idol in the temple.\n\n\n\n34\\. O Janamejaya! There the soundings of the various drums and other musical\ninstruments, the chanting of the Veda mantrams by the Brahma _n_ as, and sweet\nmusic were heard; and various sorts of festivities and rejoicings were\ncelebrated.\n\n\n\n35\\. Vyasa said :-- Thus completing the installation ceremony of the Durga\nDevi by the Brahma _n_ as, versed in the Vedas, the king Sudars\xc2\x92ana duly\nworshipped the image in various ways, etc.\n\n\n\n36\\. Thus gaining his father\xc2\x92s kingdom and worshipping the Devi, he and the\nDevi became celebrated throughout the kingdom.\n\n\n\n37\\. The religious largehearted Sudars\xc2\x92ana, on gaining his kingdom, brought\nall the other feudatory princes under his control by the sheer force of his\nreligious character.\n\n\n\n38\\. The subjects became happy and got honor in the reign of Sudars\xc2\x92ana, as\nthey got before in the reigns of Dilip, Raghu and Ramachandra.\n\n\n\n39\\. The virtue of all the citizens under Var _n_ as\xc2\x92rama shone complete with\nall its four padas; and there remained none in the world irreligious.\n\n\n\n40\\. In villages after villages, the chief townsmen began to build temples,\nworship the Goddess there with all their jolliness. Thus everywhere in the\nKosala kingdom spread the Devi worship.\n\n\n\n41\\. On the other hand, the king Subahu established the Idol in Benares, had\ntemples built and worshipped there the Devi.\n\n\n\n42\\. The inhabitants of Kas\xc2\x92i became then filled with devotion and intense\nlove towards the Devi and duly worshipped Her, as they used to do to S\xc2\x92iva in\nthe temple of Vis\xc2\x92vanatha.\n\n\n\n43\\. Thus the Durga Devi became very widely celebrated in this world. O king!\nThus in different countries, the devotion began to increase towards the\nGoddess.\n\n\n\n44\\. The Devi Bhagavati Bhavani became in every way an object to be worshipped\nand adored by all people and everywhere in Bharatavar _s_ a.\n\n\n\n45\\. The people began to recite slowly, meditate, and chant hymns as advocated\nby the \xc3\x82gamas constantly and became deeply attached to the S\xc2\x92akti worship and\nbegan to be looked upon with the highest honour by others.\n\n\n\np. 225\n\n\n\n46\\. O king! From that time all the people used to worship, perform Homa\nceremony and sacrifice duly in honour of the Devi in every Navaratri (for the\nfirst nine days of the bright half in the months of \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92vin and Chaitra).\n\n\n\nHere ends the 25th Chapter on the installation of the Devi in Ayodhya and\nBenares in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 26](bk03ch26.htm)\n\n'
