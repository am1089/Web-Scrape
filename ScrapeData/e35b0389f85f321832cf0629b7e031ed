Next follow the imprecations 1.\n\n2\\. Let him know that breath 2 is the beam (on which the whole house of the\nbody rests).\n\n3\\. If any one (a Brahma _n_ a or another man) should chide him, who by\nmeditation has become that breath as beam 3, then, if he thinks himself\nstrong, he says: 'I grasped the breath, the beam, well; thou dost not prevail\nagainst me who have grasped the breath as the beam.' Let him say to him:\n'Breath, the beam, will forsake thee.'\n\n4\\. But if he thinks himself not strong, let him say to him: 'Thou couldst not\ngrasp him who wishes to grasp the breath as the beam. Breath, the beam, will\nforsake thee.'\n\n5\\. And whatever the reciter shall say to one who speaks to him or does not\nspeak to him, depend upon it, it will come to pass. But to a Brahma _n_ a let\nhim not say anything except what is auspicious. Only he may curse a Brahma _n_\na in excessive wealth. Nay, not even in excessive wealth should he curse a\nBrahma _n_ a, but he should say, 'I bow before Brahma _n_ as,'--thus says _S_\nuravira Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[252:1](sbe01230.htm#fr_643) The commentator explains anuvyahara, not as\nimprecations, but as referring to those who leach or use the imprecations,\nsuch imprecations being necessary to guard against the loss of the benefits\naccruing from the meditation and worship here described; such teachers say\nwhat follows.\n\n[252:2](sbe01230.htm#fr_644) Breath, the union of mind and speech, as\nexplained before. This is the opinion of Sthavira _S_ akalya, cf. III, 2, 1,\n1.\n\n[252:3](sbe01230.htm#fr_645) If he should tell him that he did not meditate on\nbreath properly.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 5](sbe01231.htm)\n\n"
