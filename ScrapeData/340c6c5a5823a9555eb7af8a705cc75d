That (is united) with the ruler, on account of the going to it, and so on.\n\nAs from the statements that speech becomes united with mind and mind with\nbreath it follows that speech and\n\np. 730\n\nmind are united with mind and breath only; so we conclude from the subsequent\nclause 'breath with fire' that breath becomes united with fire only.--Against\nthis prima facie view the Sutra declares 'that breath becomes united with the\nruler of the organs, i.e. the individual soul, on account of the going to it,\nand so on.' That breath goes to the individual soul, the following text\ndeclares, 'At the time of death all the pra _n_ as go to the Self of a man\nabout to expire ' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 38), Similarly Scripture mentions the\ndeparture of pra _n_ a together with the soul, 'after him thus departing the\nprawa departs'; and again its staying together with the soul, 'What is that by\nwhose departure I shall depart, and by whose staying I shall stay?' (Pr. Up.\nVI, 3). We therefore conclude that the text 'breath with fire' means that\nbreath joined with the individual soul becomes united with fire. Analogously\nwe may say in ordinary life that the Yamuna is flowing towards the sea, while\nin reality it is the Yamuna joined with the Ganga which flows on.--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the ruler.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 5.
