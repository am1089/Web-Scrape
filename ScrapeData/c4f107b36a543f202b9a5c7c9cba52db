On account of non-difference of everything, those elsewhere.\n\nThe _Kh_ andogya and the Va _g_ asaneyaka alike record a meditation on Pra _n_\na; the object of meditation being Pra _n_ a as possessing the qualities of\nbeing the oldest and the best, and also as possessing certain other qualities\nsuch as being the richest, and so on ( _Kh_. Up. V, 1; B _ri_. Up. VI, 1). In\nthe text of the Kaushitakins, on the other hand, there is a meditation on Pra\n_n_ a which mentions the former qualities ('being the best' and 'being the\noldest'), but not the latter ('being the richest,' and so on). This,the\nPurvapakshin maintains, constitutes a difference between the objects of\nmeditation, and hence between the meditations themselves.--This view the Sutra\nsets aside 'on account of non-difference of everything, those elsewhere.'\nThere is no difference of meditation. Those qualities, viz. being the richest,\nand so on, are to be meditated upon in the other place also, viz. in the\nmeditation on Pra _n_ a of the Kaushitakins; 'since there is non-difference of\neverything,' i.e. since the text of the Kaushitakins also exhibits the very\nsame method, in all its details, for proving what it is undertaken to prove,\nviz. that Pra _n_ a is the oldest and best. And for that proof it is required\nthat Pra _n_ a should be viewed as possessing also the quality of being the\nrichest, and so on, and these qualities therefore have to be comprised in the\nmeditation of the Kaushitakins also. Hence there is no difference of\nmeditation.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'non-difference of\neverything.'\n\nIn the same way as the meditation on Pra _n_ a as the\n\np. 637\n\noldest and best cannot be accomplished without Pra _n_ a being also meditated\nupon as the richest, and so on. and as hence these latter qualities have to be\ncomprised in the meditation on Pra _n_ a of the Kaushitakins, although they\nare not expressly mentioned there; thus those qualities of Brahman also,\nwithout which the meditation on Brahman cannot be accomplished, must be\nincluded in all meditations on Brahman--this is the point to be proved next.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 11.
