Should it be said that (the passage does) not\n\np. 264\n\n[paragraph continues] (refer to Brahman) on account of the smallness of the\nabode, and on account of the denotation of that (viz. minuteness of the being\nmeditated on); we say no, because (Brahman) has thus to be meditated upon, and\nbecause (in the same passage) it is said to be like ether.\n\nIt might be contended that, as the text 'he is my Self within the heart'\ndeclares the being meditated on to dwell within a minute abode, viz. the\nheart; and as moreover another text--'smaller than a grain of rice,' &c.,\ndeclares it to be itself of minute size, that being cannot be the highest\nSelf, but only the embodied soul. For other passages speak of the highest Self\nas unlimited, and of the embodied soul as having the size of the point of a\ngoad (cp. e.g. Mu. Up. I, 1, 6, and _S_ vet. Up. V, 8).--This objection the\nSutra rebuts by declaring that the highest Self is spoken of as such, i.e.\nminute, on account of its having to be meditated upon as such. Such minuteness\ndoes not, however, belong to its true nature; for in the same section it is\ndistinctly declared to be infinite like ether--'greater than the earth,\ngreater than the sky, greater than heaven, greater than all these worlds' (\n_Kh_. Up. III, 14, 3). This shows that the designation of the highest Self as\nminute is for the purpose of meditation only.--The connexion of the whole\nsection then is as follows. The clause 'All this is Brahman; let a man\nmeditate with calm mind on this world as beginning, ending, and breathing in\nBrahman,' enjoins meditation on Brahman as being the Self of all, in so far as\nit is the cause of the origin and destruction of all, and entering into all\nbeings as their soul gives life to them. The next clause, 'Man is made of\nthought; according as his thought is in this world, so will he be when he has\ndeparted this life,' declares the attainment of the desired object to depend\non the nature of the meditation; and the following clause, 'Let him therefore\nform the following thought,' thereupon repeats the injunction with a view to\nthe declaration of details. The clause 'He who consists of mind,' &c., up to\n'who is never surprised,' then\n\np. 265\n\nstates the nature and qualities, of the being to be meditated upon, which are\nto be comprised in the meditation. Next, the clause 'He is my Self,' up to\n'the kernel of a canary seed, 'declares that the highest Person, for the\npurpose of meditation, abides in the heart of the meditating devotee;\nrepresenting it as being itself minute, since the heart is minute. After this\nthe clause 'He also is my Self,' up to 'who is never surprised,' describes\nthose aspects of the being meditated upon as within the heart, which are to be\nattained by the devotee. Next, the words 'this my Self within the heart is\nthat Brahman' enjoins the reflection that the highest Brahman, as described\nbefore, is, owing to its supreme kindness, present in our hearts in order\nthereby to refresh and inspirit us. Then the clause 'When I shall have\ndeparted from hence I shall obtain him' suggests the idea that there is a\ncertainty of obtaining him on the basis of devout meditation; and finally the\nclause 'He who has this faith has no doubt' declares that the devotee who is\nfirmly convinced of his aim being attainable in the way described, will attain\nit beyond any doubt.--From all this it appears that the 'limitation of abode,'\nand the 'minuteness' ascribed to Brahman, are merely for the purpose of\nmeditation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8.
