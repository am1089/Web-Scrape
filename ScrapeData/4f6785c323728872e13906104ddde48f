When\nKoobja knew that Huri had come, she had cloths of silk spread for him to walk\non. She advanced to meet him with the greatest joy; and all the good acts she\nhad done in former births then received their reward. Having given Oodho a\nseat outside, Krishnu entered the house of Koobja; he there saw a splendid\ncarpet spread in a picture gallery, on which was arranged a beautiful couch of\nflowers. Huri repaired to the couch, and Koobja, having withdrawn to another\nroom, bathed and perfumed herself, and having combed her braided hair, wearing\na most elegant dress and handsome jewels, adorned from head to foot, having\neaten pawn, and being sweetly scented, approached Shree Krishnu Chund with the\ngaiety and endearment, with which Ruttee, (the wife of Ramudevu,) approaches\nher husband. Having veiled herself from a feeling of modesty, she remained\napart and silent, having a great dread of the first interview. On seeing her,\nShree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy, took her by the hand; and placing her\nnear him, satisfied her desires. He then\n\np. 186\n\narose, and came to Oodho; blushing and smiling, and with downcast looks. O\ngreat king! having thus made Koobja happy, Shree Krishnu Chund returned home\nwith Oodho Jee, and said to Bulram, "I promised Akroor that I would pay him a\nvisit, so let us go to his house first and afterwards send him to Hustinapoor,\nto bring us the news of that quarter." Upon this both brothers went to\nAkroor\'s house; he was much pleased at seeing Krishnu; and making a\nsalutation, and putting the dust of his feet on his head, said with joined\nhands, and with great humility of manner, "O lord of compassion! you have\nshown me great favour by coming here, and making my house pure." Shree Krishnu\nreplied, "Uncle! why do you exalt me so highly? I am your son;" and added,\n"through your kindness, uncle! all the demons have been destroyed, but there\nis one subject, which occasions me anxiety, as I have heard that Pandoo has\ngone to heaven, and that Doorjodhun tyrannizes over my five brothers. My aunt,\nKoontee, is greatly distressed; unless yon go, who can afford her relief by\nexplanations?" Akroor Jee, on hearing these words, said in reply to Huri, "Be\nnot anxious on that subject, I will go to Hustinapoor and explain matters, and\nbring back all the news."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter L](psa51.htm)\n\n'
