Now, at one time the\nbeings surpassed (ati-ri _k_ )\n\np. 398\n\n[paragraph continues] Indra--the beings being the creatures--they were in a\nstate of equality, as it were, with him.\n\n4:5:3:22\\. Indra then bethought himself, 'How can I stand forth over\neverything here, and how may everything here be beneath me?' He saw that\ngraha, and drew it for himself. Then he stood forth over everything here, and\neverything here was\n\np. 399\n\nbeneath him. And, verily, for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw that cup of\nSoma, he stands forth over everything here, and everything here is beneath\nhim.\n\n4:5:3:33\\. Wherefore it has been said by the _Ri_ shi (Rig-veda III, 32, 11),\n'The sky hath not reached thy greatness, when thou didst rest on the earth\nwith thine other thigh,'--for, verily, yonder sky did not reach up to his\nother thigh 1: so did he stand forth over everything here, and everything here\nwas beneath him. And, verily, for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw that cup\nof Soma, he stands forth over everything here, and everything here is beneath\nhim.\n\n4:5:3:44\\. He draws it with a verse to the lord of the bay steeds (Indra\nHarivant); they (the Udgat _ri_ s) chant verses to (Indra) Harivant, and he\n(the Hot _ri_ ) afterwards recites verses to (Indra) Harivant. For Indra\nseized upon the strength, the fury (haras) of his enemies, the Asuras; and in\nlike manner does he (the sacrificer) now seize upon the strength, the fury of\nhis enemies: therefore he draws the graha with a verse to (Indra) Harivant;\nthey chant verses to Harivant, and he (the Hot _ri_ ) afterwards recites\nverses to Harivant.\n\n4:5:3:55\\. He draws it with an Anush _t_ ubh verse; for the morning press-\nfeast belongs to the Gayatri, the midday feast to the Trish _t_ ubh, and the\nevening feast to the _G_ agati. The Anush _t_ ubh, then, is over and above 2\n(ati-rikta), and he thus makes that (Soma of the\n\np. 400\n\n[paragraph continues] Sho _d_ a _s_ in) to remain over: hence he takes it with\nan Anush _t_ ubh.\n\n4:5:3:66\\. He draws it in a square cup; for there are three worlds: these same\nworlds he gains by three corners, and by the fourth corner he makes that\n(Soma) to remain over;--therefore he draws it in a square cup.\n\n4:5:3:77\\. Let him draw it at the morning pressing, after drawing the \xc3\x82graya\n_n_ a. Having been drawn at the morning pressing, it reposes apart from that\ntime: he thus makes it to outlast all (three) pressings.\n\n4:5:3:88\\. Or he may draw it at the midday pressing, after drawing the \xc3\x82graya\n_n_ a,--but this is mere speculation: let him rather draw it at the morning\npressing, after drawing the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a: having been drawn at the morning\npressing, it reposes apart from that time.\n\n4:5:3:99\\. He thus draws it therefrom with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 33; Rig-veda I,\n84, 3), 'Mount the chariot, O slayer of V _ri_ tra, thy bay steeds have been\nharnessed by prayer! May the stone by its sound draw hitherward thy mind!--\nThou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Sho _d_ a _s_ in (the\nsixteenfold)!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Sho _d_ a _s_ in!'\n\n4:5:3:1010\\. Or with this (verse, Va _g_. S. VIII, 34; Rig-veda I, 10, 3),\n'Harness thy long-maned, girth-filling bay steeds! Come hither to us, O Indra,\ndrinker of Soma, to hear our songs! Thou art taken with a support: thee to\nIndra Sho _d_ a _s_ in!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Sho _d_ a _s_ in!'\n\n4:5:3:1111\\. Thereupon he returns (to the sadas) and bespeaks the chant with,\n'Soma has been left over:\n\np. 401\n\n[paragraph continues] Turn ye back 1!' for he indeed causes it to remain over\nby that (Sho _d_ a _s_ in graha). He (the Adhvaryu) bespeaks it 2 before the\nsetting of the sun; and after sunset he (the Hot _ri_ ) follows it up by\nreciting the _s_ astra: thus he thereby joins day and night together,--\ntherefore he bespeaks (the stotra) 3 before the\n\np. 402\n\nsetting of the sun, and after sunset he follows it up by reciting the _s_\nastra 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[397:2](sbe2662.htm#fr_932) The author has now completed his exposition of the\nsimplest form of Soma-sacrifice, viz. the Agnish _t_ oma, the libations of\nwhich are accompanied by twelve chants (stotra) and as many recitations ( _s_\nastra), and which (on the press-day) requires one victim to Agni (see [IV, 2,\n5, 14](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:14)). He has also incidentally ([IV, 4, 2,\n18](sbe2656.htm#4:4:2:18)) touched upon the characteristic features of the\nUkthya sacrifice, viz. its second victim, a he-goat to Indra-Agni, and three\nadditional Uktha stotras and _s_ astras ([p. 370](sbe2657.htm#page_370) note\n[1](sbe2656.htm#fn_856)). He now proceeds to p. 398 consider another libation\nwhich, with its accompanying stotra and _s_ astra, forms the distinctive\nfeature of the Sho _d_ a _s_ in sacrifice, i.e. the one having sixteen or a\nsixteenth (hymn). This sacrifice also requires a third victim on the press-\nday, viz. a ram to Indra. By the addition, on the other hand, of the Sho _d_ a\n_s_ in graha, with its chant and recitation, to an ordinary Agnish _t_ oma,\nanother form of one day's (ekaha) Soma-sacrifice is obtained, viz. the\nAtyagnish _t_ oma, or redundant Agnish _t_ oma, with thirteen stotras and _s_\nastras. This form of sacrifice is, however, comparatively rarely used, and was\nprobably devised on mere theoretic grounds, to complete the sacrificial\nsystem. A somewhat more common form is the Atiratra, lit. 'that which has a\nnight over and above,' differing as it does from the Sho _d_ a _s_ in in that\n--besides a fourth victim (a he-goat to Sarasvati)--it has in addition a night\nperformance of libations, with three rounds (paryayas) of four stotras and _s_\nastras each (one for the Hot _ri_ and for each of his three assistants), and\nconcluding at daybreak with one more stotra, the sandhi (twilight) stotra, and\nthe A _s_ vina _s_ astra and offering. These are the forms of Soma-sacrifice\nreferred to in the present book, as required for the performance of\nsacrificial sessions (twelve days and more) of which its concluding portion\ntreats. With another form, the Va _g_ apeya sacrifice, the author deals in the\nnext Ka _n_ _d_ a. These--with the Aptoryama, which to the Atiratra adds\nanother course of four Atirikta, or superadded stotras--constitute in the\nlater official classification the seven fundamental forms (sa _m_ stha) of\nSoma-sacrifice. This term, meaning properly 'termination, consummation,'\nprobably applied originally to the concluding rites of the Soma-sacrifice\nproper, as the distinctive features of the several forms of sacrifice, but by\na natural transition, became the generic terms for the complete forms of\nsacrifice. See Professor Weber's somewhat different explanation, Ind. Stud.\nIX, 229.\n\n[399:1](sbe2662.htm#fr_933) ? Or either of his thighs. The situation depicted\nin this verse would seem that of the warrior Indra lying or kneeling on V _ri_\ntra, whom he has thrown on the ground.\n\n[399:2](sbe2662.htm#fr_934) Or, additional, in excess; see [IV, 4, 3,\n4](sbe2657.htm#4:4:3:4).\n\n[401:1](sbe2662.htm#fr_935) See [IV, 2, 5, 8](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:8). The verb,\nhere and elsewhere translated by 'to bespeak,' is upa-k _ri_ , the proper\nmeaning of which would seem 'to be to prepare, to introduce, to bring up' the\nchant. As the same verb is, however, also used for the 'driving up, or\nbringing up' of cattle (to the stable), it may perhaps have a similar meaning\nin connection with the stotra; the metres of the chant (which are often called\nthe cattle of the gods) being, as it were, 'led up' (or put to') by the\nAdhvaryu, to be 'harnessed' or 'yoked' (yu _g_ ) by the Udgat _ri_ ; see [p.\n311](sbe2649.htm#page_311), note [1](sbe2649.htm#fn_748). Instead of the\nPrastara, handed to the Udgat _ri_ on the occasion of the Pavamanas, two\nstalks of sacrificial grass are generally used with other chants; but certain\nstotras and samans require to be 'introduced' by special objects, such as a\nfan, or the two churning sticks (for producing fire), or water mixed with\navaka plants, or an arrow.\n\n[401:2](sbe2662.htm#fr_936) ? Read 'tad' for 'tam;' or 'he calls upon him (the\nUdgat _ri_ ).'\n\n[401:3](sbe2662.htm#fr_937) The Sho _d_ a _s_ i-stotra usually consists of the\nGaurivita Saman (S. V. II, 302-4); but the Nanada Saman (ib. II, 790-3) may be\nused instead. It is performed in the ekavi _m_ _s_ a stoma, i.e. the three\nverses are chanted in three turns, so as, by repetitions, to produce twenty-\none verses; the usual form being a a a-b b b-c; a-b b b-c c c; a a a-b-c c c.\nFor some modifications in the present case, see Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 258\nnote. The first turn is to be performed in a low voice, while the sun is going\ndown; the second in a middle voice, when the sun has disappeared, but not\nentirely the daylight; and the third turn in a loud voice, when darkness is\nclosing in. If, for some reason or other, the stotra is entirely performed\nafter sunset, it is chanted with a loud voice throughout. During the chanting\na horse (black, if possible), or a bullock, or he-goat is to stand at the\nfront (or back) gate of the sadas, facing the latter. Besides, a piece of gold\nis to circulate among the chanters, each of them holding it, while his turn of\nchanting lasts, and the Udgat _ri_ (or all three) doing so during the nidhana\nor finale.\n\n[402:1](sbe2662.htm#fr_938) The Sho _d_ a _s_ i- _s_ astra is minutely\ndescribed in the Ait. Br. IV, 3 seq. The opening verses are in the Anush _t_\nubh metre (of sixteen syllables), but otherwise also the Hot _ri_ has by means\nof pauses and insertions of formulas (nivid) to bring out its 'sixteenfold'\ncharacter so as to accord with its designation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 5, 4.
