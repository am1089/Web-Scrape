He then stands by him worshipping with the Vatsapra rite 1, For Pra\n_g_ apati, having by means of the Vish _n_ u-strides produced creatures,\ncreated vital power for them by means of the Vatsapra rite; and in like manner\nthe Sacrificer, having, by means of the Vish _n_ u-strides, produced creatures\n(or, subjects), creates vital power for them by means of the Vatsapra rite.\n\n6:7:4:22\\. Now the Vatsapra rite, doubtless, is he, the golden-handed 2\n(Agni);--hence whomsoever that is born one may wish to obtain the full\n(measure of) life, let him touch that one with the Vatsapra rite, and he\nthereby creates vital power for that newborn one; and accordingly that one\nobtains the full (measure of) life. And whomsoever one may wish to be\nvigorous, let him first address that one with the Vik _ri_ ti (fashioning)\nformula 3, and that one accordingly becomes vigorous.\n\n6:7:4:33\\. [Va _g_. S. XII, 18-20] 'From the sky Agni was first born;'--the\nsky, doubtless, is the breath, and from the breath he (Agni) was indeed first\nborn,--'from us the second time, the knower of beings,'--inasmuch as he, man-\nlike, on that occasion generated him a second time 4;--'the\n\np. 284\n\nthird time in the waters,'--inasmuch as he there did generate him a third time\nfrom the waters;--'he, the manly-minded, (kindling him) the imperishable,'--\nthe manly-minded, doubtless, is Pra _g_ apati; and the imperishable, Agni\n1;--'kindling him the mindful praises ( _g_ ar) him,'--for he who kindles him\ngenerates him, mindful.\n\n6:7:4:44\\. 'We know, O Agni, thy threefold three,'--Agni, Vayu (wind), \xc3\x82ditya\n(sun), these are his three in three forms;--'We know thy manifold scattered\nsites,'--inasmuch as he (Agni) is here distributed [many\nways](errata.htm#13);--'we know thy highest name which is in secret,'--'the\nyoungest,' that indeed is his highest name in secret;--'we know that source\nwhence thou art come;'--the source, doubtless, is the (heavenly) waters, for\nfrom the waters he first came.\n\n6:7:4:55\\. 'In the sea the manly-minded (kindled) thee, in the waters,'--the\nmanly-minded is Pra _g_ apati: thus, 'In the waters Pra _g_ apati (kindled)\nthee;'--'the man-watcher hath kindled thee, O Agni, in the udder of the sky,'\n--the man-watcher, doubtless, is Pra _g_ apati, and the udder of the sky is\nthe waters ;--'thee, whilst standing in the third region,'--the third region,\ndoubtless, is the sky;--'the buffaloes made (thee) grow in the lap of the\nwaters ;'--the buffaloes, doubtless, are\n\np. 285\n\nthe vital airs: thus, 'the vital airs made thee grow in the sky.'\n\n6:7:4:66\\. These (three verses 1) have one and the same explanation regarding\nhim (Agni): they are Trish _t_ ubh verses relating to Agni. Inasmuch as they\nrelate to Agni, they are Agni; and inasmuch as they are Trish _t_ ubhs, and\neleven (syllables), they are Indra;--but Agni consists of Indra and Agni: as\ngreat as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus stands\nworshipping by him. And Indra and Agni are all the gods, and Agni includes (or\nbelongs to) all the deities: as great as Agni is, as\n\np. 286\n\ngreat as is his measure, with so much he thus stands worshipping by him.\n\n6:7:4:77\\. And, again, why the Vish _n_ u-strides and the Vatsapra rite are\n(performed);--by the Vish _n_ u-strides Pra _g_ apati created this world, and\nby the Vatsapra the fire (Agni); by the Vish _n_ u-strides Pra _g_ apati\ncreated the air, and by the Vatsapra the wind (Vayu); by the Vish _n_\nu-strides Pra _g_ apati created the sky, and by the Vatsapra the sun (\xc3\x82ditya);\nby the Vish _n_ u-strides Pra _g_ apati created the regions, and by the\nVatsapra the moon; by the Vish _n_ u-strides Pra _g_ apati created that which\nhas been, and by the Vatsapra that which shall be; by the Vish _n_ u-strides\nPra _g_ apati created possession (wealth), and by the Vatsapra hope; by the\nVish _n_ u-strides Pra _g_ apati created the day, and by the Vatsapra the\nnight; by the Vish _n_ u-strides Pra _g_ apati created the former (bright)\nfortnights, and by the Vatsapra the latter (dark) fortnights; by the Vish _n_\nu-strides Pra _g_ apati created the half-months, and by the Vatsapra the\nmonths; by the Vish _n_ u-strides Pra _g_ apati created the seasons, and by\nthe Vatsapra the year: thus the reason why the Vish _n_ u-strides and Vatsapra\nare (performed) is that he thereby even now creates everything.\n\n6:7:4:88\\. And, again, why the Vish _n_ u-strides and the Vatsapra rite are\n(performed). By the Vish _n_ u-strides Pra _g_ apati drove up to heaven. He\nsaw that unyoking-place, the Vatsapra, and unyoked thereat to prevent chafing;\nfor when the yoked (beast) is not unloosed, it is chafed. In like manner the\nSacrificer drives up to heaven by the Vish _n_ u-strides; and unyokes by means\nof the Vatsapra.\n\n6:7:4:99\\. Having stridden the Vish _n_ u-strides, he then\n\np. 287\n\nforthwith stands by the fire worshipping it with the Vatsapra, just as one who\nhas journeyed would forthwith unyoke. Men (proceed) after the manner of the\ngods: hence even now, when a troop of men have journeyed they forthwith\nunyoke.\n\n6:7:4:1010\\. Now, the Vish _n_ u-strides indeed are the day and the night, and\nthe Vatsapra is the day and the night: he thus journeys for a day and a night,\nand takes rest for a day and a night: and hence even now when a troop of men\nhave journeyed for a day and a night they take rest for a day and a night.\n\n6:7:4:1111\\. Only for one half of the year he strides the Vish _n_ u-strides,\nand for one half he worships the fire with the Vatsapra; for the world of\nheaven is in the midst of the year: thus were he to stride for less than half\n(a year), he would not reach that world of heaven; and were he to do so for\nmore than half (a year), he would pass beyond that world of heaven and lose\nit; but when he strides for one half, and worships the fire for one half, he\nunyokes forthwith after reaching the world of heaven.\n\n6:7:4:1212\\. He proceeds with these two alternately 1, even as one would\naccomplish a long way by (repeatedly) unyoking. Both before and after (the\nDiksha), he combines both, the Vish _n_ u-strides and the Vatsapra; for the\nVish _n_ u-strides are the day, and the Vatsapra the night; and Pra _g_ apati,\nboth when he was about to generate and when he had generated this universe,\nenclosed it on both sides by day and night: in like\n\np. 288\n\nmanner the Sacrificer now, both when he is about to generate and when he has\ngenerated this universe, encloses it on both sides by day and night.\n\n6:7:4:1313\\. As to this they say, 'If the Vish _n_ u-strides are the day, and\nthe Vatsapra the night, and both of them are (performed) during the day, not\nduring the night, how then are they both performed for (or by) him also during\nthe night?' Well, on that (first) occasion, when he is being initiated, he, at\nthe outset, combines both (performances) in the afternoon; for the afternoon\nis the same thing as the night. Then throwing them thus together, he at the\nend combines them both in the forenoon; for the forenoon is the same thing as\nthe day; and in this way they are both performed during the day, and both\nduring the night.\n\n6:7:4:1414\\. Now early on the day on which he may intend to combine them, when\nthe sun has risen, he first throws out the ashes (from the pan); having thrown\nout the ashes, he releases his speech; having released his speech, he puts on\na kindling-stick; having put on a kindling-stick, he takes the ashes down to\n(and throws them into) the water. In the same way as he takes them down he\nreturns after taking some of the ashes; and having thrown it into the pan he\nstands reverentially by the fire. He then performs two expiations.\n\n6:7:4:1515\\. And if the day should be one for the Vish _n_ u-strides, let him,\nafter striding the Vish _n_ u-strides, worship the fire with the Vatsapra; and\nif it be one for the Vatsapra, let him, after worshipping with the Vatsapra,\nand striding the Vish _n_ u-strides, finally perform the Vatsapra. Let him not\nconclude by performing the Vish _n_ u-strides, for that would be as if\n\np. 289\n\nafter going for a drive he were not to unyoke; but when he concludes by\nperforming the Vatsapra--the Vatsapra being a halting-place--(it is) as if he\nmade a halt and unloosed (the team): let him therefore conclude by performing\nthe Vatsapra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[283:1](sbe4152.htm#fr_538) That is, the recitation of Va _g_. S. XII, 18-28\nor 29 ( _Ri_ k S. X, 45), ascribed to the poet Vatsapri Bhalandana. The Brahma\n_n_ a, however, comments only on the first three verses, and perhaps these\nalone were used for the purpose at the time when the Brahma _n_ a was\ncomposed.\n\n[283:2](sbe4152.htm#fr_539) This is a somewhat doubtful meaning of 'dakshaya\n_n_ a-hasta.' The synonyms (if correct), hira _n_ yapa _n_ i and hira _n_\nyahasta, always refer to Savit _ri_ , the sun.\n\n[283:3](sbe4152.htm#fr_540) See [VI, 7, 2,\n5](sbe4150.htm#6:7:2:5)-[6](sbe4150.htm#6:7:2:6).\n\n[283:4](sbe4152.htm#fr_541) ? Or, as a second; see above, [VI, 1, 1,\n11](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:11).\n\n[284:1](sbe4152.htm#fr_542) The construction of the text here favoured by the\nauthor is very doubtful. It has probably to be construed,--'the third time\n(he, Agni, was born) in the waters, he, the manly-minded (or, friendly to\nmen). Kindling him, the imperishable (Agni), the heedful (? or pious) one\npraises him,'--or perhaps, 'While kindling him, the considerate one praises\nhim unceasingly.' A point which favours the author's construction is that, in\nverse 3, 'n _ri_ ma _n_ aas' certainly refers not to Agni, but to him who\ngenerated him.\n\n[285:1](sbe4152.htm#fr_543) The remaining verses (XII, 21-29) are as\nfollows:--\n\n1\\. Agni roared like the thundering sky, &c. (see VI, 7, 3, 2).\n\n2\\. The upraiser of glories, the upholder of riches, the inspirer of thoughts,\nthe guardian of Soma; the excellent son of power, shines forth as king in the\nwaters, kindled before the dawns.\n\n3\\. A beacon unto all that is, the child of the world filled the two spheres\neven when born; even the hard rock he broke going thither when the five\npeoples worshipped Agni.\n\n4\\. An eager cleanser, a wise messenger, the immortal Agni has been set up\namong the mortals; flickering (?) he sends forth the red smoke, striving with\nhis bright flame to reach the sky.\n\n5\\. Looking like a golden disk, &c. (see [VI, 7, 2](sbe4150.htm#6:7:2)).\n\n6\\. Whoso maketh for thee this day a ghee-baked cake, O divine Agni of\nauspicious flame, lead him onwards to bliss, unto god-allotted glory, O\nyoungest!\n\n7\\. Make him share in the songs of triumph, make him share in every hymn that\nis sung! Dear be he unto Surya, dear unto Agni; let him prevail with the\nliving one and with them that are to be born!\n\n8\\. They that worship thee day by day, O Agni, win all desirable boons;\nardently wishing for wealth, they have opened with thee the stable filled with\ncows!\n\n9\\. Agni Vai _s_ vanara has been celebrated by the _Ri_ shis, the guardian of\nSoma, most gracious unto men: let us invoke heaven and earth who are free from\nhatred! grant us wealth, ye gods, with abundance of men!\n\n[287:1](sbe4152.htm#fr_544) That is, whilst on the first day of the Diksha, as\nwell as on the day after its completion, both the Vish _n_ u-strides and the\nVatsapra are performed, during the intermediate period of one year they are\nperformed on alternate days,--the Vish _n_ u-strides on even, and the Vatsapra\non uneven days.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 8, 1.
