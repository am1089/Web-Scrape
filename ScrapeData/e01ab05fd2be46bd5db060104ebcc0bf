She was still\nhumming the same song.\n\n"Why has your Thako been calling poor Khema names?" I burst out.\n\n"Indeed? The wretch! I will have her broomed out of the house. What a shame to\nspoil your morning out like this! As for Khema, where are the hussy\'s manners\nto go and disturb you when you are engaged? Anyhow, Chota Rani, don\'t you\nworry yourself with these domestic squabbles. Leave them to me, and return to\nyour friend."\n\nHow suddenly the wind in the sails of our mind veers round! This going to meet\nSandip outside seemed, in the light of the zenana code, such an\nextraordinarily out-of-the-way thing to do that I went off to my own room, at\na loss for a reply. I knew this was my sister-in-law\'s doing and that she had\negged her maid on to contrive this scene. But I had brought myself to such an\nunstable poise that I dared not have my fling.\n\nWhy, it was only the other day that I found I could not keep up to the last\nthe unbending hauteur with which I had demanded from my husband the dismissal\nof the man Nanku. I felt suddenly abashed when the Bara Rani came up and said:\n"It is really all my fault, brother dear. We are old-fashioned folk, and I did\nnot quite like the ways of your Sandip Babu, so I only told the guard... but\nhow was I to know that our Chota Rani would take this as an insult?--I thought\nit would be the other way about! Just my incorrigible silliness!"\n\nThe thing which seems so glorious when viewed from the heights of the\ncountry\'s cause, looks so muddy when seen from the bottom. One begins by\ngetting angry, and then feels disgusted.\n\nI shut myself into my room, sitting by the window, thinking how easy life\nwould be if only one could keep in harmony with one\'s surroundings. How simply\nthe senior Rani sits in her verandah with her betel-nuts and how inaccessible\nto me has become my natural seat beside my daily duties! Where will it all\nend, I asked myself? Shall I ever recover, as from a delirium, and forget it\nall; or am I to be dragged to depths from which there can be no escape in this\nlife? How on earth did I manage to let my good fortune escape me, and spoil my\nlife so? Every wall of this bedroom of mine, which I first entered nine years\nago as a bride, stares at me in dismay.\n\nWhen my husband came home, after his M.A. examination, he brought for me this\norchid belonging to some far-away land beyond the seas. From beneath these few\nlittle leaves sprang such a cascade of blossoms, it looked as if they were\npouring forth from some overturned urn of Beauty. We decided, together, to\nhang it here, over this window. It flowered only that once, but we have always\nbeen in hope of its doing so once more. Curiously enough I have kept on\nwatering it these days, from force of habit, and it is still green.\n\nIt is now four years since I framed a photograph of my husband in ivory and\nput it in the niche over there. If I happen to look that way I have to lower\nmy eyes. Up to last week I used regularly to put there the flowers of my\nworship, every morning after my bath. My husband has often chided me over\nthis.\n\n"It shames me to see you place me on a height to which I do not belong," he\nsaid one day.\n\n"What nonsense!"\n\n"I am not only ashamed, but also jealous!"\n\n"Just hear him! Jealous of whom, pray?"\n\n"Of that false me. It only shows that I am too petty for you, that you want\nsome extraordinary man who can overpower you with his superiority, and so your\nneeds must take refuge in making for yourself another \'me\'."\n\n"This kind of talk only makes me angry," said I.\n\n"What is the use of being angry with me?" he replied. "Blame your fate which\nallowed you no choice, but made you take me blindfold. This keeps you trying\nto retrieve its blunder by making me out a paragon."\n\nI felt so hurt at the bare idea that tears started to my eyes that day. And\nwhenever I think of that now, I cannot raise my eyes to the niche.\n\nFor now there is another photograph in my jewel case. The other day, when\narranging the sitting-room, I brought away that double photo frame, the one in\nwhich Sandip\'s portrait was next to my husband\'s. To this portrait I have no\nflowers of worship to offer, but it remains hidden away under my gems. It has\nall the greater fascination because kept secret. I look at it now and then\nwith doors closed. At night I turn up the lamp, and sit with it in my hand,\ngazing and gazing. And every night I think of burning it in the flame of the\nlamp, to be done with it for ever; but every night I heave a sigh and smother\nit again in my pearls and diamonds.\n\nAh, wretched woman! What a wealth of love was twined round each one of those\njewels! Oh, why am I not dead?\n\nSandip had impressed it on me that hesitation is not in the nature of woman.\nFor her, neither right nor left has any existence--she only moves forward.\nWhen the women of our country wake up, he repeatedly insisted, their voice\nwill be unmistakably confident in its utterance of the cry: "I want."\n\n"I want!" Sandip went on one day--this was the primal word at the root of all\ncreation. It had no maxim to guide it, but it became fire and wrought itself\ninto suns and stars. Its partiality is terrible. Because it had a desire for\nman, it ruthlessly sacrificed millions of beasts for millions of years to\nachieve that desire. That terrible word "I want" has taken flesh in woman, and\ntherefore men, who are cowards, try with all their might to keep back this\nprimeval flood With their earthen dykes. They are afraid lest, laughing and\ndancing as it goes, it should wash away all the hedges and props of their\npumpkin field. Men, in every age, flatter themselves that they have secured\nthis force within the bounds of their convenience, but it gathers and grows.\nNow it is calm and deep like a lake, but gradually its pressure will increase,\nthe dykes will give way, and the force which has so long been dumb will rush\nforward with the roar: "I want!"\n\nThese words of Sandip echo in my heart-beats like a war-drum. They shame into\nsilence all my conflicts with myself. What do I care what people may think of\nme? Of what value are that orchid and that niche in my bedroom? What power\nhave they to belittle me, to put me to shame? The primal fire of creation\nburns in me.\n\nI felt a strong desire to snatch down the orchid and fling it out of the\nwindow, to denude the niche of its picture, to lay bare and naked the\nunashamed spirit of destruction that raged within me. My arm was raised to do\nit, but a sudden pang passed through my breast, tears started to my eyes. I\nthrew myself down and sobbed: "What is the end of all this, what is the end?"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV](hw17.htm)\n\n'
