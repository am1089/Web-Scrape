I got an inkling of it the other day.\n\nEver since my arrival, Nikhil\'s sitting-room had become a thing amphibious--\nhalf women\'s apartment, half men\'s: Bimala had access to it from the zenana,\nit was not barred to me from the outer side. If we had only gone slow, and\nmade use of our privileges with some restraint, we might not have fallen foul\nof other people. But we went ahead so vehemently that we could not think of\nthe consequences.\n\nWhenever Bee comes into Nikhil\'s room, I somehow get to know of it from mine.\nThere are the tinkle of bangles and other little sounds; the door is perhaps\nshut with a shade of unnecessary vehemence; the bookcase is a trifle stiff and\ncreaks if jerked open. When I enter I find Bee, with her back to the door,\never so busy selecting a book from the shelves. And as I offer to assist her\nin this difficult task she starts and protests; and then we naturally get on\nto other topics.\n\nThe other day, on an inauspicious  13 Thursday afternoon, I rallied forth from\nmy room at the call of these same sounds. There was a man on guard in the\npassage. I walked on without so much as glancing at him, but as I approached\nthe door he put himself in my way saying: "Not that way, sir."\n\n"Not that way! Why?"\n\n"The Rani Mother is there."\n\n"Oh, very well. Tell your Rani Mother that Sandip Babu wants to see her."\n\n"That cannot be, sir. It is against orders."\n\nI felt highly indignant. "I order you!" I said in a raised voice.\n\n"Go and announce me."\n\nThe fellow was somewhat taken aback at my attitude. In the meantime I had\nneared the door. I was on the point of reaching it, when he followed after me\nand took me by the arm saying: "No, sir, you must not."\n\nWhat! To be touched by a flunkey! I snatched away my arm and gave the man a\nsounding blow. At this moment Bee came out of the room to find the man about\nto insult me.\n\nI shall never forget the picture of her wrath! That Bee is beautiful is a\ndiscovery of my own. Most of our people would see nothing in her. Her tall,\nslim figure these boors would call "lanky". But it is just this lithesomeness\nof hers that I admire--like an up-leaping fountain of life, coming direct out\nof the depths of the Creator\'s heart. Her complexion is dark, but it is the\nlustrous darkness of a sword-blade, keen and scintillating.\n\n"Nanku!" she commanded, as she stood in the doorway, pointing with her finger,\n"leave us."\n\n"Do not be angry with him," said I. "If it is against orders, it is I who\nshould retire."\n\nBee\'s voice was still trembling as she replied: "You must not go. Come in."\n\nIt was not a request, but again a command! I followed her in, and taking a\nchair fanned myself with a fan which was on the table. Bee scribbled something\nwith a pencil on a sheet of paper and, summoning a servant, handed it to him\nsaying: "Take this to the Maharaja."\n\n"Forgive me," I resumed. "I was unable to control myself, and hit that man of\nyours.\n\n"You served him right," said Bee.\n\n"But it was not the poor fellow\'s fault, after all. He was only obeying his\norders."\n\nHere Nikhil came in, and as he did so I left my seat with a rapid movement and\nwent and stood near the window with my back to the room.\n\n"Nanku, the guard, has insulted Sandip Babu," said Bee to Nikhil.\n\nNikhil seemed to be so genuinely surprised that I had to turn round and stare\nat him. Even an outrageously good man fails in keeping up his pride of\ntruthfulness before his wife--if she be the proper kind of woman.\n\n"He insolently stood in the way when Sandip Babu was coming in here,"\ncontinued Bee. "He said he had orders ..."\n\n"Whose orders?" asked Nikhil.\n\n"How am I to know?" exclaimed Bee impatiently, her eyes brimming over with\nmortification.\n\nNikhil sent for the man and questioned him. "It was not my fault," Nanku\nrepeated sullenly. "I had my orders."\n\n"Who gave you the order?"\n\n"The Bara Rani Mother."\n\nWe were all silent for a while. After the man had left, Bee said: "Nanku must\ngo!"\n\nNikhil remained silent. I could see that his sense of justice would not allow\nthis. There was no end to his qualms. But this time he was up against a tough\nproblem. Bee was not the woman to take things lying down. She would have to\nget even with her sister-in-law by punishing this fellow. And as Nikhil\nremained silent, her eyes flashed fire. She knew not how to pour her scorn\nupon her husband\'s feebleness of spirit. Nikhil left the room after a while\nwithout another word.\n\nThe next day Nanku was not to be seen. On inquiry, I learnt that he had been\nsent off to some other part of the estates, and that his wages had not\nsuffered by such transfer.\n\nI could catch glimpses of the ravages of the storm raging over this, behind\nthe scenes. All I can say is, that Nikhil is a curious creature, quite out of\nthe common.\n\nThe upshot was, that after this Bee began to send for me to the sitting-room,\nfor a chat, without any contrivance, or pretence of its being an accident.\nThus from bare suggestion we came to broad hint: the implied came to be\nexpressed. The daughter-in-law of a princely house lives in a starry region so\nremote from the ordinary outsider that there is not even a regular road for\nhis approach. What a triumphal progress of Truth was this which, gradually but\npersistently, thrust aside veil after veil of obscuring custom, till at length\nNature herself was laid bare.\n\nTruth? Of course it was the truth! The attraction of man and woman for each\nother is fundamental. The whole world of matter, from the speck of dust\nupwards, is ranged on its side. And yet men would keep it hidden away out of\nsight, behind a tissue of words; and with home-made sanctions and prohibitions\nmake of it a domestic utensil. Why, it\'s as absurd as melting down the solar\nsystem to make a watch-chain for one\'s son-in-law!  14\n\nWhen, in spite of all, reality awakes at the call of what is but naked truth,\nwhat a gnashing of teeth and beating of breasts is there! But can one carry on\na quarrel with a storm? It never takes the trouble to reply, it only gives a\nshaking.\n\nI am enjoying the sight of this truth, as it gradually reveals itself. These\ntremblings of steps, these turnings of the face, are sweet to me: and sweet\nare the deceptions which deceive not only others, but also Bee herself. When\nReality has to meet the unreal, deception is its principal weapon; for its\nenemies always try to shame Reality by calling it gross, and so it needs must\nhide itself, or else put on some disguise. The circumstances are such that it\ndare not frankly avow: "Yes, I am gross, because I am true. I am flesh. I am\npassion. I am hunger, unashamed and cruel."\n\nAll is now clear to me. The curtain flaps, and through it I can see the\npreparations for the catastrophe. The little red ribbon, which peeps through\nthe luxuriant masses of her hair, with its flush of secret longing, it is the\nlolling tongue of the red storm cloud. I feel the warmth of each turn of her\n_sari_ , each suggestion of her raiment, of which even the wearer may not be\nfully conscious.\n\nBee was not conscious, because she was ashamed of the reality; to which men\nhave given a bad name, calling it Satan; and so it has to steal into the\ngarden of paradise in the guise of a snake, and whisper secrets into the ears\nof man\'s chosen consort and make her rebellious; then farewell to all ease;\nand after that comes death!\n\nMy poor little Queen Bee is living in a dream. She knows not which way she is\ntreading. It would not be safe to awaken her before the time. It is best for\nme to pretend to be equally unconscious.\n\nThe other day, at dinner, she was gazing at me in a curious sort of way,\nlittle realizing what such glances mean! As my eyes met hers, she turned away\nwith a flush. "You are surprised at my appetite," I remarked. "I can hide\neverything, except that I am greedy! Anyhow, why trouble to blush for me,\nsince I am shameless?"\n\nThis only made her colour more furiously, as she stammered: "No, no, I was\nonly..."\n\n"I know," I interrupted. "Women have a weakness for greedy men; for it is this\ngreed of ours which gives them the upper hand. The indulgence which I have\nalways received at their hands has made me all the more shameless. I do not\nmind your watching the good things disappear, not one bit. I mean to enjoy\nevery one of them."\n\nThe other day I was reading an English book in which sex-problems were treated\nin an audaciously realistic manner. I had left it lying in the sitting-room.\nAs I went there the next afternoon, for something or other, I found Bee seated\nwith this book in her hand. When she heard my footsteps she hurriedly put it\ndown and placed another book over it--a volume of Mrs Hemans\' poems.\n\n"I have never been able to make out," I began, "why women are so shy about\nbeing caught reading poetry. We men--lawyers, mechanics, or what not--may well\nfeel ashamed. If we must read poetry, it should be at dead of night, within\nclosed doors. But you women are so akin to poesy. The Creator Himself is a\nlyric poet, and Jayadeva  15 must have practised the divine art seated at His\nfeet."\n\nBee made no reply, but only blushed uncomfortably. She made as if she would\nleave the room. Whereupon I protested: "No, no, pray read on. I will just take\na book I left here, and run away." With which I took up my book from the\ntable. "Lucky you did not think of glancing over its pages," I continued, "or\nyou would have wanted to chastise me."\n\n"Indeed! Why?" asked Bee.\n\n"Because it is not poetry," said I. "Only blunt things, bluntly put, without\nany finicking niceness. I wish Nikhil would read it."\n\nBee frowned a little as she murmured: "What makes you wish that?"\n\n"He is a man, you see, one of us. My only quarrel with him is that he delights\nin a misty vision of this world. Have you not observed how this trait of his\nmakes him look on _Swadeshi_ as if it was some poem of which the metre must be\nkept correct at every step? We, with the clubs of our prose, are the\niconoclasts of metre."\n\n"What has your book to do with _Swadeshi_?"\n\n"You would know if you only read it. Nikhil wants to go by made- up maxims, in\n_Swadeshi_ as in everything else; so he knocks up against human nature at\nevery turn, and then falls to abusing it. He never will realize that human\nnature was created long before phrases were, and will survive them too."\n\nBee was silent for a while and then gravely said: "Is it not a part of human\nnature to try and rise superior to itself?"\n\nI smiled inwardly. "These are not your words", I thought to myself. "You have\nlearnt them from Nikhil. You are a healthy human being. Your flesh and blood\nhave responded to the call of reality. You are burning in every vein with\nlife-fire--do I not know it? How long should they keep you cool with the wet\ntowel of moral precepts?"\n\n"The weak are in the majority," I said aloud. "They are continually poisoning\nthe ears of men by repeating these shibboleths. Nature has denied them\nstrength--it is thus that they try to enfeeble others."\n\n"We women are weak," replied Bimala. "So I suppose we must join in the\nconspiracy of the weak."\n\n"Women weak!" I exclaimed with a laugh. "Men belaud you as delicate and\nfragile, so as to delude you into thinking yourselves weak. But it is you\nwomen who are strong. Men make a great outward show of their so-called\nfreedom, but those who know their inner minds are aware of their bondage. They\nhave manufactured scriptures with their own hands to bind themselves; with\ntheir very idealism they have made golden fetters of women to wind round their\nbody and mind. If men had not that extraordinary faculty of entangling\nthemselves in meshes of their own contriving, nothing could have kept them\nbound. But as for you women, you have desired to conceive reality with body\nand soul. You have given birth to reality. You have suckled reality at your\nbreasts."\n\nBee was well read for a woman, and would not easily give in to my arguments.\n"If that were true," she objected, "men would not have found women\nattractive."\n\n"Women realize the danger," I replied. "They know that men love delusions, so\nthey give them full measure by borrowing their own phrases. They know that\nman, the drunkard, values intoxication more than food, and so they try to pass\nthemselves off as an intoxicant. As a matter of fact, but for the sake of man,\nwoman has no need for any make-believe."\n\n"Why, then, are you troubling to destroy the illusion?"\n\n"For freedom. I want the country to be free. I want human relations to be\nfree."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[13](hw10.htm#fr_12) According to the Hindu calendar [Trans.].\n\n[14](hw10.htm#fr_13) The son-in-law is the pet of a Hindu household.\n\n[15](hw10.htm#fr_14) A Vaishnava poet (Sanskrit) whose lyrics of the adoration\nof the Divinity serve as well to express all shades of human passion [Trans.].\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III](hw11.htm)\n\n'
