Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Thou, the foremost of the Knowers of the Vedas! I have\nheard from you the anecdotes of many Devis. Now I want to hear the lives of\nother Devis also. Kindly describe.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n2\\. Naraya _n_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Best of the Brahma _n_ as! The lives and glorious\ndeeds of all the Devis are described separately. Now say, which lives you want\nto hear.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n3\\. Narada said :--\xc2\x93O Lord! _S_ a _st_ hi, Mangala Cha _nd_ i, and Manasa, are\nthe parts of Prakriti. Now I want to hear the lives of them.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n4-22. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Child! The sixth part of Prakriti is named as\n_S_ a _st_ hi. The Devi _S_ a _st_ hi is the Presiding Deity of infants and\nchildren; She is the Maya of Vi _sn_ u and She bestows sons to all. She is one\nof the sixteen Matrikas. She is known by the name of Devasena. She performs\nVratas (vows); She is the chaste and dearest wife of Skanda. She decides on\nthe longevity of children and is always engaged in their preservation. So much\nso, that this Siddha Yogini always keeps the children on her side.\n\n\n\nO Best of Brahma _n_ as! I will now talk about the method of worshipping this\nDevi and the history about Her bestowing children that I heard from Dharma\nDeva. Hear. Svayambhuva Manu had one son Priyavrata. He was a great Yogindra\nand remained in practising austerities. So he was not inclined to have any\nwife. At last by the effort and request of Brahma, he got himself married. But\nmany days passed, and he could not see the face of a son. Then Mahar _s_ i\nKas\xc2\x92yapa became his priest in the Putre _st_ i Sacrifice (to get a son); and\nwhen the sacrifice was over, he gave the sacrificial offering called charu to\nhis wife Malini. On eating the charu, the queen Malini become pregnant. For\ntwelve Deva years she held the womb. After twelve years she delivered a full\ndeveloped son, of a golden colour; but the son was lifeless and his two\neyeballs were upset. At this, the friends\xc2\x92 wives became very sorry and began\nto weep. The mother of the child became so very sorrowful that she became\nsenseless. O Muni! The King himself took the son on his breast and went to the\nburning ground. There with his child on his breast he began to cry aloud.\nRather he got himself ready to quit his own\n\n\n\np. 986\n\n\n\nlife than leave the son from away his breast. At this time he saw in the space\noverhead an aerial car, white as crystal, made of excellent jewels, coming\ntowards him. The car was shining with its own lustre, encircled with woven\nsilken cloth, which added to its beauty. Innumerable garlands of variegated\ncolours gave it a very nice and charming appearance. On that car was seated a\nSiddha Yogini, very beautiful, of a lovely appearance of a colour like that of\nwhite champakas, always youthful, smiling, adorned with jewel ornaments, ever\ngracious to show favour to the devotees. On seeing Her, the King Priyavrata\nplaced the child from his breast on the ground and began to worship Her and\nchant hymns to Her with great love and devotion. And he then asked that\npeaceful lady, the wife of Skanda, Who was shining like a summer sun :-- \xc2\x93O\nBeautiful! Who art Thou? Whose wife art Thou and whose daughter art Thou? From\nThy appearance it seems that Thou art fortunate and respected amongst the\nfemale sex.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n23-24. O Narada! In ancient times, when the Daityas dispossessed the Devas of\ntheir positions, this Lady was elected as a general and got victory for the\nDevas; hence She was named Devasena. Hearing the words of the King Priyavrata,\nDevasena, who fought for the Devas and was all good to the whole world, said\n:--\n\n\n\n25-42. O King! I am the mind-born daughter of Brahma. My name is Devasena. The\nCreator before created Me out of His mind and made Me over to the hands of\nSkanda. Amongst the Matrikas, I am known as _S_ a _st_ hi, the wife of Skanda.\nI am the sixth part of Prakriti; hence I am named _S_ a _st_ hi. I give sons\nto those who have no sons, wives to those who have no wives, wealth to the\npoor, and I give works to those who are workers (karmis.)\n\n\n\nHappiness, pain, fear, sorrow, joy, good, and wealth and adversity all are the\nfruits of Karmas. As the result of one\xc2\x92s Karmas, people get lots of sons and\nit is due to the result of one\xc2\x92s Karma again that people are denuded of all\nthe issues of their family. As the result of Karma, the people get dead sons;\nand as the result of Karma the people get long lives. All enjoy the fruits of\ntheir Karmas, whether they be well qualified, or deformed or whether they have\nmany wives, or whether they have no wife, whether they be beautiful,\nreligious, diseased, it is all through Karmas, Karmas. Disease comes out of\ntheir Karmas. Again they get cured by their Karmas. So, O King! It is stated\nin the Vedas that Karma is the most powerful of all. Thus saying, Devasena\ntook the dead child on her lap; and, by the wisdom, early made the child\nalive. The King saw the child, of a golden colour got back his life and\n\n\n\np. 987\n\n\n\nbegan to smile. Thus bidding goodbye to the King, Devasena took the child and\nbecame ready to depart. At this the King\xc2\x92s palate and throat got dry and he\nbegan again to chant hymns to Her. The Devi _S_ a _st_ hi became pleased at\nthe stotra made by the King. The Devi then addressed the King and said :-- \xc2\x93O\nKing! All that is stated in the Vedas, is made up of Karmas. You are the son\nof Svayambhuva Manu, and the Lord of the three worlds. You better promulgate\nMy worship in the three worlds and you yourself worship Me. Then I will give\nyou your beautiful son, the lotus of your family. Your son, born in part of\nNaraya _n_ a, will be famous by the name of Suvrata. He will be well-\nqualified, a great literary man, able to remember his conditions in his former\nlives, the best of Yogis, performer of one hundred Yaj\xc3\xb1as, the best of all,\nbowed down by the K _s_ attriyas, strong as one lakh powerful elephants,\nwealthy, fortunate, pure, favourite of literary persons, learned and bestower\nof the fruits of the ascetics, renowned and bestower of wealth and prosperity\nto the three worlds.\xc2\x94 Thus saying Devasena gave the the child to the king.\nWhen the king promised that he would promulgate Her worship, the Devi granted\nhim boons and went up to the Heavens.\n\n\n\n43-57. The king, too, becoming very glad and surrounded by his ministers,\nreturned to his own abode and informed all about the son. The ladies of the\nhouse, become highly delighted when they heard everything. On the occasion of\nthe son\xc2\x92s getting back his life, the king performed everywhere auspicious\nceremonies. The worship of _S_ a _st_ hi Devi commenced. Wealth was bestowed\nto the Brahmi _n_ s. Since then, on every sixth day of the bright fortnight in\nevery month, great festivals in honour of _S_ a _st_ hi Devi began to be\ncelebrated. Since then, throughout the kingdom, on every sixth day after the\nbirth of a child in the lying-in-chamber, _S_ a _st_ hi Devi began to be\nworshipped. On the twenty-first day, the auspicious moment, at the ceremony of\ngiving rice to a child for the first time, when sixth months old, and on all\nother auspicious ceremonies of the children, _S_ a _st_ hi Devi\xc2\x92s worship was\nmade extant and the king himself performed those worships with great care and\naccording to due rules. Now I will tell you about the Dhyanam and method of\nworship and stotra as I heard from Dharma Deva, and as stated in Kauthuma\nS\xc2\x92akha. Hear. He has said :-- In a S\xc2\x92alagrama stone, in a jar, on the root of\na Ba _t_ a tree, or drawing the figure on the floor of the rooms, or making an\nimage of _S_ a _st_ hi Devi, the sixth part of Prakriti and installing it, one\nshould worship the Devi. The Dhyanam is this :-- \xc2\x93O Devasena Thou art the\nbestower of good sons, the giver of good luck; Thou art mercy and kindness and\nthe progenitor of the world; Thy colour is\n\n\n\np. 988\n\n\n\nbright like that of the white Champaka flowers. Thou art decked with jewel\nornaments. Thou art pure, and the highest and best Devi. Obeisance to Thee! I\nmeditate on Thee.\xc2\x94 Thus meditating, the worshipper should place flower on his\nown head. Then again meditating and uttering the principal mantra one is to\noffer the Padya (water for washing feet), Arghya, \xc3\x82chamaniya, scents, flowers,\ndhup, lights, offerings of food and best roots and fruits and one should\nworship thus with various things Sasthi Devi. \xc2\x93Om Hrim _S_ a _st_ hi Devyai\nSvaha\xc2\x94 is the principal Mantra of _S_ a _st_ hi Devi. This great Mantra of\neight letters a man should repeat as his strength allows. After the Japam, the\nworshipper should chant hymns with devotion and undivided attention and then\nbow down. The Stotra (hymn) of _S_ a _st_ hi Devi as per Sama Veda is very\nbeautiful and son-bestowing.The lotus-born Brahma has said :-- If one repeats\n(makes Japam) this eight lettered mantra one lakh of times, one gets certainly\na good son. O Best of Munis! Now I am going to say the auspicious stotra of\n_S_ a _st_ hi Devi as composed by Priyavrata. Hear.\n\n\n\n58-73. One\xc2\x92s desires are fulfilled when one reads this very secret stotra.\nThus the King Priyavrata said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi, Devasena! I bow down to Thee. O\nGreat Devi! Obeisance to Thee! Thou art the bestower of Siddhis; Thou art\npeaceful; obeisance to Thee! Thou art the bestower of good; Thou art Devasena;\nThou art _S_ a _st_ hi Devi, I bow down to Thee! Thou grantest boons to\npersons; Thou bestowest sons and wealth to men. So obeisance to Thee! Thou\ngivest happiness and mok _s_ a; Thou art _S_ a _st_ hi Devi; I bow down to\nThee. Thou thyself art Siddha; so I bow down to Thee. O _S_ a _st_ hi Devi!\nThou art the sixth part of this creation; Thou art Siddha Yogini, so I bow\ndown to Thee. Thou art the essence, Thou art Sarada; Thou art the Highest\nDevi. So I bow down again and again to Thee. Thou art the Presiding Deity _S_\na _st_ hi Devi of the children; I bow down to Thee. Thou grantest good; Thou\nThyself art good and Thou bestowest the fruits of all Karmas. O Thou O _S_ a\n_st_ hi Devi! Thou shewest thy form to thy devotees; I bow down to Thee! Thou\nart S\xc2\x92uddha Sattva and respected by all the persons in all their actions. Thou\nart the wife of Skanda. All worship Thee. O _S_ a _st_ hi Devi! Thou hadst\nsaved the Devas. So obeisance to Thee O _S_ a _st_ hi Devi! Thou hast no envy,\nno anger; so obeisance to Thee. O Sures\xc2\x92vari! Give me wealth, give me dear\nthings, give me sons. Give me respect from all persons; give me victory; slay\nmy enemies. O Mahe _s_ vari! Give me Dharma; give me name and fame; I bow down\nagain again to _S_ a _st_ hi Devi. O _S_ a _st_ hi Devi! worshipped\nreverentially by all! Give me lands, give me subjects, give me learning; have\nwelfare for me; I bow down again and\n\n\n\np. 989\n\n\n\nagain to _S_ a _st_ hi Devi.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Thus praising the Devi, Priyavrata got\na son, renowned and ruling over a great kingdom through the favour of _S_ a\n_st_ hi Devi. If any man that has no son, hears this stotra of _S_ a _st_ hi\nDevi for one year with undivided attention, he gets easily an excellent son,\nhaving a long life. If one worships for one year with devotion this Devasena\nand hears this stotra, even the most barren woman becomes freed from all her\nsins and gets a son. Through the grace of _S_ a _st_ hi Devi, that son becomes\na hero, well qualified, literate, renowned and long-lived. If any woman who\nbears only a single child or delivers dead children hears with devotion for\none year this stotra, she gets easily, through the Devi\xc2\x92s grace, a good son.\nIf the father and mother both hear with devotion, this story during the period\nof their child\xc2\x92s illness, then the child becomes cured by the Grace of the\nDevi.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Forty-sixth chapter of the Ninth Book on the anecdote of _S_ a\n_st_ hi Devi in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 47](bk09ch47.htm)\n\n'
