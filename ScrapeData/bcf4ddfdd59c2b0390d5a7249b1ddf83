On account of (Brahman's) abiding (within the individual soul); thus Ka\n_s_ ak _ri_ tsna (holds).\n\np. 393\n\nWe must object likewise to the view set forth in the preceding Sutra, viz.\nthat Brahman is denoted by terms denoting the individual soul because that\nsoul when departing becomes one with Brahman. For that view cannot stand the\ntest of being submitted to definite alternatives.--Is the soul's not being\nsuch, i.e. not being Brahman, previously to its departure from the body, due\nto its own essential nature or to a limiting adjunct, and is it in the latter\ncase real or unreal? In the first case the soul can never become one with\nBrahman, for if its separation from Brahman is due to its own essential\nnature, that separation can never vanish as long as the essential nature\npersists. And should it be said that its essential nature comes to an end\ntogether with its distinction from Brahman, we reply that in that case it\nperishes utterly and does not therefore become Brahman. The latter view,\nmoreover, precludes itself as in no way beneficial to man, and so on.--If, in\nthe next place, the difference of the soul from Brahman depends on the\npresence of real limiting adjuncts, the soul is Brahman even before its\ndeparture from the body, and we therefore cannot reasonably accept the\ndistinction implied in saying that the soul becomes Brahman only when it\ndeparts. For on this view there exists nothing but Brahman and its limiting\nadjuncts, and as those adjuncts cannot introduce difference into Brahman which\nis without parts and hence incapable of difference, the difference resides\naltogether in the adjuncts, and hence the soul is Brahman even before its\ndeparture from the body.--If, on the other hand, the difference due to the\nadjuncts is not real, we ask--what is it then that becomes Brahman on the\ndeparture of the soul?--Brahman itself whose true nature had previously been\nobscured by Nescience, its limiting adjunct!--Not so, we reply. Of Brahman\nwhose true nature consists in eternal, free, self-luminous intelligence, the\ntrue nature cannot possibly be hidden by Nescience. For by 'hiding' or\n'obscuring' we understand the cessation of the light that belongs to the\nessential nature of a thing. Where, therefore, light itself and alone\nconstitutes the essential nature of a thing, there\n\np. 394\n\ncan either be no obscuration at all, or if there is such it means complete\nannihilation of the thing. Hence Brahman's essential nature being manifest at\nall times, there exists no difference on account of which it could be said to\n_become_ Brahman at the time of the soul's departure; and the distinction\nintroduced in the last Sutra ('when departing') thus has no meaning. The text\non which Au _d_ ulomi relies, 'Having risen from this body,' &c., does not\ndeclare that that which previously was not Brahman becomes such at the time of\ndeparture, but rather that the true nature of the soul which had previously\nexisted already becomes manifest at the time of departure. This will be\nexplained under IV, 4, 1.\n\nThe theories stated in the two preceding Sutras thus having been found\nuntenable, the teacher Ka _s_ ak _ri_ tsna states his own view, to the effect\nthat words denoting the _g_ iva are applied to Brahman because Brahman abides\nas its Self within the individual soul which thus constitutes Brahman's body.\nThis theory rests on a number of well-known texts, 'Entering into them with\nthis living (individual) soul let me evolve names and forms' ( _Kh_. Up. VI,\n3, 2); 'He who dwelling within the Self, &c., whose body the Self is,' &c. (\n_Br_ i. Up. III, 7, 22); 'He who moves within the Imperishable, of whom the\nImperishable is the body,' &c; 'Entered within, the ruler of beings, the Self\nof all.' That the term ' _g_ iva' denotes not only the _g_ iva itself, but\nextends in its denotation up to the highest Self, we have explained before\nwhen discussing the text, 'Let me evolve names and forms.' On this view of the\nidentity of the individual and the highest Self consisting in their being\nrelated to each other as body and soul, we can accept in their full and\nunmutilated meaning all scriptural texts whatever--whether they proclaim the\nperfection and omniscience of the highest Brahman, or teach how the individual\nsoul steeped in ignorance and misery is to be saved through meditation on\nBrahman, or describe the origination and reabsorption of the world, or aim at\nshowing how the world is identical with Brahman. For this reason the author of\nthe Sutras,\n\np. 395\n\nrejecting other views, accepts the theory of Ka _s_ ak _ri_ tsna. Returning to\nthe Maitreyi-brahma _n_ a we proceed to explain the general sense, from the\npassage previously discussed onwards. Being questioned by Maitreyi as to the\nmeans of immortality, Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya teaches her that this means is given in\nmeditation on the highest Self ('The Self is to be seen,' &c.). He next\nindicates in a general way the nature of the object of meditation ('When the\nSelf is seen,' &c.), and--availing himself of the similes of the drum, &c.--of\nthe government over the organs, mind, and so on, which are instrumental\ntowards meditation. He then explains in detail that the object of meditation,\ni.e. the highest Brahman, is the sole cause of the entire world; and the ruler\nof the aggregate of organs on which there depends all activity with regard to\nthe objects of the senses ('As clouds of smoke proceed,' &c.; 'As the ocean is\nthe home of all the waters'). He, next, in order to stimulate the effort which\nleads to immortality, shows how the highest Self abiding in the form of the\nindividual Self, is of one uniform character, viz. that of limitless\nintelligence ('As a lump of salt,' &c.), and how that same Self characterised\nby homogeneous limitless intelligence connects itself in the Sa _m_ sara state\nwith the products of the elements ('a mass of knowledge, it rises from those\nelements and again vanishes into them'). He then adds, 'When he has departed,\nthere is no more knowledge'; meaning that in the state of Release, where the\nsoul's unlimited essential intelligence is not contracted in any way, there is\nnone of those specific cognitions by which the Self identifying itself with\nthe body, the sense-organs, &c., views itself as a man or a god, and so on.\nNext--in the passage, 'For where there is duality as it were'--he, holding\nthat the view of a plurality of things not having their Self in Brahman is due\nto ignorance, shows that for him who has freed himself from the shackles of\nignorance and recognises this whole world as animated by Brahman, the view of\nplurality is dispelled by the recognition of the absence of any existence\napart from Brahman. He then proceeds, 'He by whom he knows all this, by what\nmeans should\n\np. 396\n\nhe know Him?' This means--He, i.e. the highest Self, which abiding within the\nindividual soul as its true Self bestows on it the power of knowledge so that\nthe soul knows all this through the highest Self; by what means should the\nsoul know Him? In other words, there is no such means of knowledge: the\nhighest Self cannot be fully understood by the individual soul. 'That Self,'\nhe continues, 'is to be expressed as--not so, not so!' That means--He, the\nhighest Lord, different in nature from everything else, whether sentient or\nnon-sentient, abides within all beings as their Self, and hence is not touched\nby the imperfections of what constitutes his body merely. He then concludes,\n'Whereby should he know the Knower? Thus, O Maitreyi, thou hast been\ninstructed. Thus far goes Immortality'; the purport of these words being--By\nwhat means, apart from the meditation described, should man know Him who is\ndifferent in nature from all other beings, who is the sole cause of the entire\nworld, who is the Knower of all, Him the Supreme Person? It is meditation on\nHim only which shows the road to Immortality. It thus appears that the\nMaitreyi-brahma _n_ a is concerned with the highest Brahman only; and this\nconfirms the conclusion that Brahman only, and with it Prak _ri_ ti as ruled\nby Brahman, is the cause of the world.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of\n'the connexion of sentences.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 23.
