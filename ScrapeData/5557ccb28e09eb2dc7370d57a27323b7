There may be (a double sense) of the one (word), as in the case of the\nword 'Brahman.'\n\nSince in the clause 'from that Self there sprang Brahman,' the word 'sprang'\ncannot be taken in its literal senbe, it may be used there in a secondary\nsense; while the same word as connected with the subsequent clauses 'from Vayu\nAgni,' &c., may have its primary sense. This would be analogous to the use of\nthe word Brahman in Mu. Up. I, 1. There in the clause 'From him is born that\nBrahman, name, form, and matter' (9). the word _Brahman_ is used in a\nsecondary sense, i.e. denotes the Pradhana; while in the same chapter, in the\nclause 'Brahman swells by means of brooding' (8), the same word denotes\nBrahman in its primary sense. It is true indeed that in this latter case the.\nword 'Brahman' occurs twice; while in the Taitt. text the word 'sambhuta'\noccurs once only, and has to be carried\n\np. 534\n\nover from the first clause into the subsequent ones; but this makes no\ndifference, for, in the case of such carrying over of a word, no less than in\nthe case of actual repetition, the general denotation of the word is repeated.\n--The next Sutra refutes this objection.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 5.
