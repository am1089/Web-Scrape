Now truly when the Hot _ri_ praises (recites the _s_ astra 2), he\nsings, and to him thus singing the\n\np. 326\n\n[paragraph continues] Adhvaryu responds (prati-a-gar), whence the name\nresponse (pratigara).\n\n4:3:2:22\\. [The Hot _ri_ ] calls upon that (Adhvaryu) seated (before him) with\nhis face towards the east 1. For all\n\np. 327\n\nothers except the Udgat _ri_ perform their priestly duties while facing the\neast, and in this manner that priestly duty of his is performed towards the\neast.\n\n4:3:2:33\\. Now the Udgat _ri_ is Pra _g_ apati, and the Hot _ri_ , (being) the\n_Ri_ k (fem.), is a female. And when he chants, then the Udgat _ri_ , Pra _g_\napati, implants seed in the female Hot _ri_ , the _Ri_ k; this the Hot _ri_\nbrings forth by means of the _s_ astra (recitation), he sharpens\n\np. 328\n\nit even as this man is sharpened 1, and because he thereby sharpens ( _s_ o)\ntherefore it is called sastra.\n\n4:3:2:44\\. Having turned round (so as to face the Hot _ri_ , the Adhvaryu)\nthen responds: thereby he quickens 2 that implanted seed. On the other hand,\nwere he to respond while standing with his face turned away (from the Hot _ri_\n), that implanted seed would assuredly perish away, and would not be brought\nforth; but thus facing each other (the male and female) bring forth the\nimplanted seed.\n\n4:3:2:55\\. Now the strength of the metres was exhausted by the gods, for it\nwas by the metres that the gods attained the world of heaven. And the response\n(song) is ecstasy (mada 3)--what ecstasy there is in the _ri_ _k_ and that\nwhich there is in the Saman, that is sap: this sap he now lays into the\nmetres, and thus makes the metres of restored strength; and with them of\nrestored strength they perform the sacrifice.\n\n4:3:2:66\\. Hence if (the Hot _ri_ ) recites by half-verses, let (the Adhvaryu)\nrespond at each half-verse; and if he recites by padas (hemistichs), let him\nrespond at each pada. For whenever, in reciting, he (the Hot _ri_ ) draws\nbreath, there the Asura-Rakshas rush into the sacrifice: there he (the\nAdhvaryu) closes it up by means of the response, so that the evil spirits, the\nRakshas, cannot rush in; and thus he destroys the world of the sacrificer\'s\nenemies.\n\np. 329\n\n4:3:2:77\\. Now, in the beginning the metres consisted of four syllables. Then\n_G_ agati flew up for Soma and came back, leaving behind three syllables. Then\nTrish _t_ ubh flew up for Soma and came back, leaving behind one syllable.\nThen Gayatri flew up for Soma, and she came back bringing with her those\nsyllables as well as Soma. Thus she came to consist of eight syllables:\nwherefore they say, \'Gayatri is octosyllabic.\'\n\n4:3:2:88\\. With her they performed the morning feast of the Soma-sacrifice,--\nwhence the morning feast pertains to Gayatri. With her they performed the\nmidday feast. Trish _t_ ubh then said to her, \'To thee will I come with three\nsyllables: invite me, and exclude me not from the sacrifice!\'--\'So be it!\' she\nsaid and invited her. Thus the Trish _t_ ubh came to consist of eleven\nsyllables, and therefore they say, \'The midday Soma feast pertains to Trish\n_t_ ubh.\'\n\n4:3:2:99\\. With her (Gayatri) indeed they performed the evening feast. _G_\nagati then said to her, \'To thee will I come with one syllable: invite me, and\nexclude me not from the sacrifice!\'--\'So be it!\' she said and invited her.\nThus the _G_ agati came to consist of twelve syllables; and therefore they\nsay, \'The evening Soma feast pertains to _G_ agati.\'\n\n4:3:2:1010\\. As to this they say, \'Surely all the Soma feasts pertain to\nGayatri, since Gayatri alone went on increasing.\' At the morning feast he\nshould therefore respond with a complete (formula), for complete 1 Gayatri\nreturned. At the midday feast\n\np. 330\n\n[paragraph continues] (he responds with a formula) containing once (the verb)\n\'to rejoice (mad) 1,\' for she (Trish _t_ ubh) came back, leaving one syllable\nbehind; and with that same (formula) he then completes her, makes her whole,\n\n4:3:2:1111\\. When trish _t_ ubh verses were recited. At the evening Soma feast\n(the Adhvaryu responds with a formula) containing thrice (the verb) \'to\nrejoice 2,\' for she ( _G_ agati) came back leaving three syllables behind; and\nwith these (formulas) he then completes her, makes her whole,--\n\n4:3:2:1212\\. When (the hymn) to Heaven and Earth is recited 3. Now these\ncreatures subsist on those two,\n\np. 331\n\nthe heaven and the earth--he thereby imbues those two, heaven and earth, with\nvigour; and upon those two, thus vigorous and affording the means of\nsubsistence, these creatures subsist. Let him respond with \'Om!\' only, for\nthat is truth, that the gods know.\n\n4:3:2:1313\\. Now some respond with \'Othamo daiva vak,\' saying, \'The response\nis speech (vak): thus we obtain speech.\' But let him not do this; for surely,\nin whichsoever way he may respond, speech is obtained by him, since he\nresponds by speech. Let him therefore respond with \'Om 1!\' only, for that is\ntruth, that the gods know.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[325:2](sbe2651.htm#fr_777) Every chant or hymn (stotra) of the Udgat _ri_ s\nis followed by a \'song of praise\' ( _s_ astra) recited by the Hot _ri_ or one\nof his three assistants (Maitravaru _n_ a, Brahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin, and A\n_kh_ avaka); the first two _s_ astras at each savana being recited by the Hot\n_ri_ , and the three additional ones at the morning and midday feast by his\nassistants (Hotrakas). The exact correlation between the stotras and _s_\nastras at the three savanas will appear from the following table:--\n\nI. Prata _h_ -savana.\n\n1\\.

At the Ukthya sacrifice, the performance of the evening feast\nis completed by the addition of three uktha stotras and _s_ astras, one for\neach Hotraka.\n\n[326:1](sbe2651.htm#fr_778) While the Adhvaryu sits before the Sadas, with his\nback to the Hot _ri_ ([p. 322](sbe2650.htm#page_322), note\n[1](sbe2650.htm#fn_771)), the latter performs the (tush _n_ im-) _g_ apa--i.e.\nthe muttering of the formula \'May Father Matari _s_ van grant flawless\n(verse-) feet! may the bards sing flawless hymns!\' &c. Ait. Br. II, 38; \xc3\x82 _s_\nv. _S_ r. V, 9, 1--after which he addresses to the Adhvaryu his call (ahava),\n\' _s_ o _m_ savom (let us two recite, Om)!\'--which formula is used at all _s_\nastras, except that, at the midday and evening libations, it is preceded by\n\'Adhvaryo\' (O Adhvaryu); while at the evening savana the first syllable of the\nverb is repeated, thus \' _s_ o _s_ o _m_ savo.\'--The Adhvaryu rises, turns\nround so as to face the Hot _ri_ , and responds by \' _s_ o _m_ samo daiva (we\nrecite, O divine one)!\' According to Ait. Br. III, 12, the \xc3\x82hava and Pratigara\ntogether are to consist of the number of syllables corresponding to the metre\nof the respective libation, viz. 8, 11, 12 respectively. Then follows the Hot\n_ri_ s Tush _n_ i _m_ - _s_ a _m_ sa or \'silent praise;\' viz. \'Earth! Agni is\nthe light, the light is Agni, Om!--Indra is the light, Ether! the light is\nIndra, Om! Surya is the light, the light, Heaven! is Surya, Om!\'--This is\nfollowed by a Puroru _k_ , or preliminary invocation of a deity, recited in a\nloud voice, (and consisting of twelve short formulas resembling the Nivid part\ni, p. 114, note 2; ib. I, 4, 2, 5 seq.), which, indeed, takes its place in the\n_s_ astras of the midday and evening libations, being inserted in the middle\nor before the last verse of the hymn of the _s_ astra; viz. Agni kindled by\nthe gods, Agni kindled by man, Agni the well-kindling, the Hot _ri_ chosen by\nthe gods, the Hot _ri_ chosen by men, the carrier of offerings, the leader of\nsacrifices, the irresistible Hot _ri_ , the swift carrier of oblations: may\nhe, the god, p. 327 bring hither the gods! may Agni, the god, worship the\ngods! may (Agni), the knower of beings, perform the sacrificial rites!\' (Ait.\nBr. II, 34.) Then follows the hymn, the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya-sukta, the chief part of the\n_s_ astra, viz. Rig-veda III, 13, \'To him, your god Agni, will I sing with\nloudest voice; may he come hither to us with the gods; may he, the best\nofferer, sit down on our sacred grass!\' &c.; the seven (anush _t_ ubh) verses\nof which are recited in the order 1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 2, 7. The first and last\nverses being, however, repeated thrice, the number is thus raised to eleven.\nThe recitation of the hymn is followed by the so-called ukthavirya (\'the\nstrength of the praise\'), consisting of the formula uktha _m_ va _k_ i,\n\'praise hath been sung,\' with some words added to it differing at different\n_s_ astras,--at the present _s_ astra \'ghoshaya tva,\' \'thee (I have recited)\nfor sound (praise)!\' [for school-differences as to these formulas, see Haug,\nTransl. Ait. Br. p. 177],--to which the Adhvaryu responds, \'Om ukthasa _h_ ,\'\n\'yea, singer of praise!\' The Ukthavirya, together with the response, is again\nto consist of as many syllables as the characteristic metre of the respective\nlibation. Then follows the recitation, by the \xc3\x82gnidhra (Ait. Br. VI, 14), of\nthe ya _g_ ya or offering prayer, viz. Rig-veda III, 25, 4.--As regards the\nterm \'a _g_ ya,\' the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_. Br. VII, 2, 1, 2, derives it from a _g_ i, a\nrace, in accordance with the following legend: When Pra _g_ apati offered\nhimself as a sacrifice to the gods, the latter could not agree as to which of\nthem should have the first share. Pra _g_ apati then proposed that they should\nrun a race for it. In this race Agni came off first, then Mitravaruna, then\nIndra. To each of these three divinities an a _g_ ya was thereupon assigned;\nand, by a secret understanding between Indra and Agni, these two divided the\nfourth a _g_ ya between them. Hence the agneya, maitravaru _n_ a, aindra, and\naindragna _s_ astra (and stotra), belonging to the Hot _ri_ , Maitravaru _n_\na, Brahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin, and A _kh_ avaka priests respectively.\n\n[328:1](sbe2651.htm#fr_779) That is, fashions him, or makes him slender. A\nfanciful derivation of _s_ astra ( _s_ a _m_ s, to recite, praise, cf.\ncarmen), from the root _s_ a ( _s_ o), to sharpen (? or from _s_ as, to cut,\ncarve). \'Yathayam purovarti purushas tiksh _n_ ak _ri_ ta _h_ ,\navaya(va)vibhagena spash _t_ ik _ri_ tas tatha _s_ astre _n_ aitad reta _h_\n_s_ yati spash _t_ a _m_ karoti,\' Say.\n\n[328:2](sbe2651.htm#fr_780) Upanimadati, \'cheers;\' the Ka _n_ va text (W.) has\n\'upanivadati.\'\n\n[328:3](sbe2651.htm#fr_781) Or, intoxication, intoxicating drink. See\n[paragraph 10](sbe2651.htm#4:3:2:10), and p. 330, note 1\n\n[329:1](sbe2651.htm#fr_782) Or perhaps, successful, sa _m_ siddha [svakiyany\nakshara _n_ y aparitya _g_ yavik _ri_ ta (? avik _ri_ tta), Say.]. The\nresponse (pratigara) here alluded to, is probably the one ordinarily used by\nthe Adhvaryu, whenever the Hot _ri_ pauses in his recitation, at the end of\nhalf-verses p. 330 (or padas), nivids, &c., viz. \'Othamo daiva,\'--or, Othavo\ndaivom, whenever the Hot _ri_ puts in the sacred syllable \'om.\' \'Tasmat kara\n_n_ ad gayatra-prata _h_ savane sa _m_ siddham avik _ri_ ta _m_ vidhasyamanam\nomantam prati-g _ri_ h _n_ iyat,\' Say. For the Adhvaryu\'s response, \' _s_ a\n_m_ samo daiva,\' to the Hot _ri_ \'s summons (ahava), see p. 326, note 1.\n\n[330:1](sbe2651.htm#fr_783) When the first verse of the trish _t_ ubh hymn,\nRig-veda X, 73, is recited by the Hot _ri_ in the Marutvatiya Sastra at the\nmidday feast, the Adhvaryu\'s response is \'madamo daiva\' (we rejoice, O divine\none). Katy. X, 3, 8; cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, p. 37.\n\n[330:2](sbe2651.htm#fr_784) According to Katy. X, 6, 6 \'madamo daiva\' is\noptionally the Adhvaryu\'s response at the recitation in the \xc3\x82gnimarutra _S_\nastra of three of the so-called Anupaniya (or Svadushkiliya) trish _t_ ubh\nverses VI, 47, 1-4 (see note on [IV, 4, 2, 18](sbe2656.htm#4:4:2:18)).\nPossibly the present paragraph may refer to those verses, in which case the\nwords \'when trish _t_ ubh verses are recited\' would begin a fresh paragraph.\nSaya _n_ a, however, seems to take it in the same way as above; cf. also the\nKa _n_ va reading in next note.\n\n[330:3](sbe2651.htm#fr_785) This is the ( _G_ agati) hymn I, 159 recited in\nthe Vai _s_ vadeva Sastra. According to Katy. X, 6, 5, the response is to be\nthrice (after each of the three first verses) \'madamo daiva.\' The Ka _n_ va\nhas for paragraphs 10-12, \'At the morning feast he responds by a complete\n(formula), for complete Gayatri returned. At the midday feast he responds once\nwith one containing "mad," when he p. 331 recites trish _t_ ubh verses, for\nshe (Trish _t_ ubh) returned leaving one syllable behind: hereby now he\ncompletes her, makes her whole. At the evening feast with something containing\nthrice "mad," for she ( _G_ agati) returned leaving three syllables behind:\nhereby now he completes her, makes her whole. At the (hymn) to Heaven and\nEarth he responds with one that contains "mad;" when he recites (the hymn)\nHeaven and Earth--these creatures subsisting on those two, Heaven and Earth--\nhe thereby puts juice into them, and upon those two, thus rendered juiceful,\nthese creatures subsist. He responds with "Om," for that is truth, that the\ngods know.\'\n\n[331:1](sbe2651.htm#fr_786) That is, instead of \'vak,\' hence \'Othamo daivom.\'\n\'Om\' pure and simple is the response at the end of the _s_ astra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 3.
