For slaying a Kshatriya (the offender) shall 1\n\np. 202\n\ngive to the king one thousand cows and besides a bull in expiation of his sin,\n\n2\\. For (slaying) a Vai _s_ ya one hundred cows, for (slaying) a _S_ udra ten;\nand a bull (must be) added (in each case). 2\n\n3\\. (The punishment for) the murder of a woman--excepting a (Brahma _n_ i) who\nhad bathed after temporary uncleanness--and for the destruction of a cow have\nbeen explained by the (rule regarding the) murder of a _S_ udra. 3\n\n4\\. If he has slain a milch-cow or a draught-ox, he shall perform a _K_\nandraya _n_ a (lunar penance) after (paying the prescribed fine).\n\n5\\. The (punishment for the) murder of a (Brahma _n_ i) who had bathed after\ntemporary uncleanness has been explained by (the rule regarding) the murder of\na Kshatriya. 5\n\n6\\. For killing a flamingo, a Bhasa, a peacock, a Brahma _n_ i duck, a Pra _k_\nalaka, a crow, an owl, a frog, a musk-rat, a dog, (the large ichneumon called)\nBabhru, a common ichneumon, and so forth, (the offender shall pay) the same\n(fine) as (for the murder of) a _S_ udra. 6\n\n7\\. In order to gain the good opinion of men, a witness shall give evidence in\naccordance with what he has seen or heard. 7\n\np. 203\n\n8\\. Of injustice (in decisions) one quarter falls on the party in the cause,\none quarter on his witnesses, one quarter on all the judges, and one quarter\non the king. 8\n\nBut where he who deserves condemnation is condemned, the king is guiltless and\nthe judges free from blame; the guilt falls on the offender (alone).\n\n9\\. (Therefore) a wise man should ask an appointed witness in the following\nmanner: 9\n\n10\\. \'The merit which thou hast acquired in the interval between the night in\nwhich thou wast born and that in which thou wilt die, all that will go to the\nking, if thou speakest an untruth.\' 10\n\n11\\. \'A witness who speaks falsely, slays three fathers and three grandfathers\nand seven (descendants), both the born and the unborn.\' 11\n\n12\\. \'By false testimony concerning gold he kills three ancestors; by false\ntestimony regarding (small) cattle he kills five; by false testimony\nconcerning kine he kills ten.\' 12\n\n\'He kills a hundred by false evidence regarding horses, (and) a thousand by\nfalse evidence concerning a man. A witness Who speaks falsely, destroys the\nwhole (world) by false evidence concerning land.\'\n\np. 204\n\n13\\. (Men of) the four castes (var _n_ a) who have sons may be witnesses\nexcepting _S_ rotriyas, the king, ascetics, and those who are destitute of\nhuman (intellect). 13\n\n14\\. If (the witness rightly) recollects (the facts of) the case (he will\nreceive) commendation from the most eminent men. 14\n\n15\\. In the contrary case (he will) fall into hell. 15\n\n16\\. Let him (who has given false evidence), drink hot milk during twelve\n(days and) nights or offer burnt oblations (reciting) the Kushma _n_ _d_ a\n(texts). 16\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[201:1](sbe1452.htm#fr_1007) **19**. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 24, I. Govinda explains\nvairaniryatanartham p. 201 in two ways: 1. in expiation of his sin; 2. in\norder to remove the enmity of the relatives of the murdered man. He adds all\nthese punishments are really penances (praya _s_ _k_ ittas) to be imposed by\nthe king. \xc3\x82pastamba has these Sutras in the section on penances.\n\n[202:2](sbe1452.htm#fr_1008) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 24, 2-4.\n\n[202:3](sbe1452.htm#fr_1009) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 24, 5; I, 9, 26, I.\n\n[202:5](sbe1452.htm#fr_1010) Vasish _th_ a XX, 34, 37.\n\n[202:6](sbe1452.htm#fr_1011) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 13.\n\n[202:7](sbe1452.htm#fr_1012) Vish _n_ u VIII, 13-14.\n\n[203:8](sbe1452.htm#fr_1013) Manu VIII, 18-19.\n\n[203:9](sbe1452.htm#fr_1014) I read, with the Telugu copy of the commentary,\nsakshi _n_ a _m_ tvevam uddish _t_ am. All the MSS. of the text and C. I. read\nsakshi _n_ a _m_ daivam uddish _t_ am. Govinda\'s explanation, adhuna nirdish\n_t_ an sakshi _n_ a evam pri _k_ _kh_ ed iti padanvaya _h_ , \'the construction\nof the words is, "let him now ask the appointed witnesses in the following\nmanner," agrees with the reading adopted.\n\n[203:10](sbe1452.htm#fr_1015) Vasish _th_ a XVI, 32-53.\n\n[203:11](sbe1452.htm#fr_1016) \'Three fathers and three grandfathers,\' i.e.\nseven ancestors.\n\n[203:12](sbe1452.htm#fr_1017) Vasish _th_ a XVI, 34. Regarding the explanation\nof the p. 204 words \'he kills,\' see Manu VIII, 97, and Haradatta on Gautama\nXIII, 14.\n\n[204:13](sbe1452.htm#fr_1018) Vasish _th_ a XVI, 28-30. The text has ra _g_\nanya, \'members of the royal family.\' But the parallel passages of other\nDharma-sutras, e _g_. Vish _n_ u VIII, 2, make it probable that the king is\nmeant.\n\n[204:14](sbe1452.htm#fr_1019) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 11, 29, 10. Govinda takes the\nSutra differently. His commentary runs as follows: sakshidvaye sati ra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\na, tatpurushai _s_ _k_ a ki _m_ kartavyam ity ata aha || srim _ri_ tau\npradhanata _h_ pratipatti _h_ || pradhanyatas taponirdish _t_ avidyadibhi _h_\n| tadva _k_ anat pratipattir ni _s_ _k_ aya _h_ karya ityadhyahara _h_ karya\n_h_ || \'What shall the king and his officers do, if there are two witnesses?\nIn order to answer this question he says: "On recollection, according to pre-\neminence, reliance." According to pre-eminence, i.e. on account of\nausterities, (being) appointed (as a witness), learning and the like; in\naccordance with the evidence of such person\'s conviction. i.e. the decision\nmust be made. The latter word has to be understood.\' Govinda then goes on to\nquote Manu VIII, 73.\n\n[204:15](sbe1452.htm#fr_1020) \xc3\x82pastamba II, It, 29, 9. Govinda and M. read\nkart _ri_ patyam for kartapatyam, the reading of the Dekhan and Gu _g_ arat\nMSS. The explanation of the former term is said to be dosha _h_ , \'sin.\'\nRegarding the ancient word kartapatya, which Govinda and the writer of M. have\nnot understood, see Haradatta on \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 5, 3.\n\n[204:16](sbe1452.htm#fr_1021) In accordance with his explanation of Sutra 14,\nGovinda thinks that this penance is to be performed by the king and the judges\nin case they fail to weigh the evidence properly. But p. 205 according to Manu\nVIII, 106, Vish _n_ u VIII, 16, the oblations with the Kushma _n_ _d_ as\n(Taitt. \xc3\x82r. X, 3-5) are to be offered for uttering in evidence a venial\nfalsehood. That is, no doubt, here, too, the real meaning.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 11, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 20](sbe1453.htm)\n\n'
