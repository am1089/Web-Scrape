Vyasa said :-- The World-Mother, hearing Tamra\xc2\x92s words, spoke laughing a\nlittle and with a deep voice like that of a rumbling thunder cloud.\n\n\n\n2-13. The Devi spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Tamra! Go and say to your Lord Mahi _s_ a who, it\nseems, is stupid, whose end is nigh, who has become very passionate, and who\nis void of knowledge what is proper and what is improper. I am not like your\ngrown up mother, the she-buffalo, having horns, eating grass, with a long tail\nand a big-belly. I do not like to have Vi _sn_ u, the god S\xc2\x92ankara, Brahma,\nKuvera, Varu _n_ a, or Fire. How then can I select a beast? If I do so, I will\nbe an object of much censure amongst the several worlds. I am not desirous of\nany more husband; my Husband is existing; though He is the Lord of all,\nWitness of All, yet He is not the Actor; He is without any desires and He is\ncalm\n\n\n\np. 394\n\n\n\nand tranquil. He, the S\xc2\x92iva, is devoid of any Prakritic qualities, without any\nattachment, the Great Infinite, without anyone to rely on, without any refuge,\nomniscient, omnipresent, the Great Witness, the Full, and the seat of the\nFull, the Auspicious. He is the abode of all, capable to do all, the peaceful,\ncapable to create everything and He is seeing everywhere. How can I then leave\nHim and try to serve the dull, stupid Mahi _s_ a? Let him come and fight with\nthis understanding that he will be defeated and be made the conveyance of\nYama, the God of Death or the carrier of water of the human beings. And if\nthat impious heretic desire to live, let him fly at once to Patala with all\nhis demon comrades; else I will slay him in battle. See! The combination of\nsimilar substances leads to happiness; and if out of ignorance, the connection\ntakes place between things entirely different in their natures, it becomes at\nonce the source of all pains and troubles. You are a thorough illiterate when\nyou ask me to worship your lord; do you not see me endowed with exquisite\nbeauty? and what is your Mahi _s_ a? A buffalo with horns; how can then\ncreation become possible between us? Better fly away or fight if you like; I\nwill kill you and your friends, and if you leave the region of Heavens and the\nshare of Yaj\xc3\xb1a, then you will become happy.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n14-30. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus saying, the Devi howled and roared so\nloudly that it appeared strange and it caused a great terror to the Danavas\nwho took it as the great dissolution of the universe at the end of a Kalpa.\nThe earth and the mountains trembled; the wives of the Danavas, had\nmiscarriages at that terrific noise. Tamra hearing that sound was terrified;\nhis mind became unsteady and he at once fled to Mahi _s_ a. O King! The\nDanavas present in the city became deaf; thy fled and became very anxious and\nwere absorbed in the thought whence and how that sound came. The lion, too,\nenraged and, raising up its manes, roared so loud that the Daityas became very\nmuch terrified. Mahi _s_ a, too, became confounded to see Tamra returning; he\nthen held a council with his ministers what ought to be done next? Mahi _s_\nasura said :-- \xc2\x93O best of the Danavas! Shall we now take our shelter within\nthe forts? Or shall we go out and fight? Or will it be favourable to us if we\nfly away? You all are intelligent and versed in all the S\xc2\x92astras and\nunconquerable by your foes; therefore ought you all to consult over the the\nmatter in utmost privacy for our success at the present moment. The root of\nKingdom lies in the council in the secret place (cabinet) and Statesmanship;\nif this counsel be kept well preserved in secrecy, then that Kingdom is also\nkept entire; therefore it is highly incumbent that the plan be kept in\nstrictest confidence amongst the good and virtuous ministers. If the plan be\nout, then destruction comes both to the King and his Kingdom; hence the plan\nmust be kept secret\n\n\n\np. 395\n\n\n\nby those wanting glory, lest it be taken advantage of and rendered ineffective\nby other persons. O Ministers! Now declare, taking due consideration of time\nand place, after duly discussing and ascertaining what is the best course to\nadopt, what would be beneficial and full of reason and intelligence. First\nfind out the cause why this powerful woman, created by the Devas has come here\nalone and helpless? That woman is challenging us to fight. What more wonder\ncan there be than this? Who can say in the three worlds what the result will\nbe, whether it will be good or otherwise? Victory comes not to many persons\nnor defeat comes to a single individual; therefore victory or defeat lies at\nthe hands of the Luck and Destiny. Those who plead for place, policy,\nstatesmanship, they say what is Fate? Is there anyone who has seen Fate? (Adri\n_st_ a) No one has seen His appearance. It may be argued that there may exist\nsuch a thing as Fate; to which it might be replied, what proofs are there for\nsuch an existence? Thus the weak persons alone hold it out as their only hope;\nnowhere are seen energetic persons who can fulfil their ends by their own\nefforts, by those who enrol themselves under Fate. Therefore \xc2\x93effort,\xc2\x94\n\xc2\x93energy\xc2\x94 are the words of the heroes and \xc2\x93Fate\xc2\x94 is the word of the cowards.\nYou should all consider today these subjects fully and intelligently and then\ndecide what are we to do?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n31-39. Vyasa said :-- Thus hearing the King, the famous Vidalak _s_ a with\nfolded hands spoke thus :-- O King! First it should be definitely ascertained\nwhose wife is she, this woman possessing large eyes? Whence and for what\npurpose has she come here; next what ought to be done should be decided. It\nseems to me that the Devas, knowing that your death will ensue from the hands\nof a woman, have created very carefully this lotus-eyed woman out of their own\nessences. And they are lying in wait, unknown to anybody in the celestial\nspace with a desire to see the battle but really to fight with you. In due\ntime, they will undoubtedly help this woman. When the war will ensue, Vi _sn_\nu and the other Devas will put this woman in front and slay us all. Whereas\nthis Devi will slay you. This is their earnest desire. O King! I have come to\nknow this beforehand; but what will be the actual result I cannot say. I\ncannot say also whether it is advisable for You to fight now; therefore it\nwould be better if you consider yourself well on this matter of the gods and\ndo accordingly. Our duty, the duty of your servants lies in this :-- That we\nshould sacrifice at any moment our lives for the preservation of your prestige\nand to enjoy with you whenever you are enjoying. But, O King! It is extremely\nadvisable to ponder over this very carefully when we see that this woman,\nthough alone, is challenging us to fight who are armed with powerful soldiers.\n\n\n\np. 396\n\n\n\n40-44. Durmukha said :-- O King! I know for certain, that we will not get\nvictory in this battle; still we ought not to show our backs; for that would\nlead us to sheer disgrace. Even in our encounter with Indra and other Devas,\nwe did nothing hateful and blameable; then how can any of us fly away when we\ncome face to face with a helpless woman? Therefore fight we must; that is\ncertain; let whatever happen. What is inevitable, must come to pass. Thus\nconsidered, what need we care for the result? If we die in the battle, we will\nget name and fame; if we be victorious, we will get happiness. Thus thinking\nboth the cases, we must fight today. Death is inevitable when our longevity\nexpires; our prestige will suffer if we fly away; therefore we ought not to\nspend uselessly our time in thus expressing our vain regret for life or for\ndeath.\n\n\n\n45-51. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the Durmukha\xc2\x92s words, Vaskala, the\neloquent speaker, thus spoke to the king, with clasped hands and his head\nbowed down. O King! You need not think thus in agony with this unpleasant\naffair; alone I will kill that Cha _nd_ ika, of unsteady eyes. O Best of\nkings! To be always prompt and energetic indicates that one is steady in one\xc2\x92s\nheroic valour; to consider one\xc2\x92s enemy as dreadful is contrary to above; so we\nought now to take recourse to heroic valour. O King! Therefore I will discard\nfear altogether and fight out valiantly; I will no doubt, send Cha _nd_ ika in\nthe battlefield to the abode of Death. I fear not Yama, nor Indra, nor Kuvera,\nnor Vayu nor Ag _n_ i, nor Vi _sn_ u, nor S\xc2\x92ankara, nor Moon nor Sun; I do not\nfear any of them; what fear can I, then, entertain of that vain arrogant\nwoman, who has got none to support her. I will kill Her with these arrows,\nsharpened on stones. You can see today the prowess of my arms and enjoy peace;\nyou will not have to go to battle anymore to fight with Her.\n\n\n\n52-65. Vyasa said :-- O King! Vaskala having said thus to the lord Mahi _s_ a\nin a haughty spirit, Durdhara bowed down and said thus :-- O Lord of the\nearth! Let the purpose be whatsoever, with which the beautiful Devi with\neighteen hands, the creation of the gods, may come hither, I will vanquish\nHer. O King! I think, it is simply to terrify you, as the Suras have thus\ncreated this Maya woman; therefore, do you forsake your delusion by knowing\nthis merely as a scare. O King! Such is the statesmanship; now hear about the\nworkings of the ministers. Ministers in this world are of three kinds :-- (1)\nSattvik; (2) Rajasik and (3) Tamasik. Those ministers in whom the Sattva\nquality is predominant, they perform their Master\xc2\x92s duties according to their\nown strength. The Sattvik Mantris (ministers) are well versed in their Mantra\nS\xc2\x92astras (the policies and statesmanship), virtuous and one-pointed in their\nthoughts, they never do any injury to their king and they fulfil\n\n\n\np. 397\n\n\n\ntheir own purposes. The Rajasik Mantris are of different sorts; they are\nalways after their own interests; at times, whenever they like, they do the\nState duties. The Tamasik Mantris always look of their own interests out of\ntheir greedy nature; they serve their ends even by ruining the regal\ninterests. It is the Tamasik Mantris that are influenced by the bribes from\nthe enemies, become separated at their hearts from their own masters and give\nout the secrets to the enemies, while staying in their homes. They always\nadvise alienation policy like the sword ensheathed in a scabbard; and when the\ntime of war comes, they always frighten their masters. Therefore, O King!\nNever put your trust on ministers; if you do so, they will always hinder you\nin your actions and counsels; what harm cannot be done by those ministers that\nare treacherous, greedy, deceitful and void of any intelligence and always\naddicted to vicious acts, when they are trusted! Therefore, O King! I will go\nmyself to the battle and serve your purpose; you need not be at all anxious in\nthis matter. I will soon bring before you that vicious woman; I will do your\nactions by my own strength and powers. Let you be calm; and look at my\nstrength, fortitude and valour.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twelfth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the holding of counsel by\nMahi _s_ asura in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000\nSlokas by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 13](bk05ch13.htm)\n\n'
