The term livelihood' (v _ri_ tti) is used because they subsist thereby\n(tadvartanat).\n\n3\\. The word Salina (is used) because they dwell in houses ( _s_ ala).\n\n4\\. To be a Yayavara (means that one) goes on by means of a most excellent\nlivelihood (v _ri_ ttya varaya yati).\n\n5\\. The term _K_ akra _k_ ara is derived from going by turns (to the houses of\nrich men). 5\n\n6\\. We will explain those (above-mentioned means of livelihood) in their\nproper order.\n\n7\\. They are nine, (viz.) Sha _n_ _n_ ivartani, Kauddali, Dhruva,\nSamprakshalani, Samuha, Palani, Silo _\xc3\xb1_ _kh_ a, Kapota, and Siddho _\xc3\xb1_ _kh_\na. 7\n\np. 285\n\n8\\. (In addition) to these there is a tenth way of living, viz. forest-life.\n\n9\\. (If he desires to adopt) any of the nine ways of living,\n\n10\\. He causes the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his\nnails to be cut, and besides gets ready (the following objects),\n\n11\\. (Viz.) the skin of a black antelope, a water-pot, a staff, a yoke for\ncarrying burdens, (and) a sickle. 11\n\n12\\. He desires to go forth, after having offered a Traidhataviya (offering)\nor a Vai _s_ vanari (ish _t_ i). 12\n\n13\\. Now on the (following) morning, after the sun has risen, he makes the\nsacred fires burn brightly, melts butter on the Garhapatya fire, cleanses it\n(with Ku _s_ a grass), heats the (spoons called) Sru _k_ and Sruva, cleans\n(them), takes out four (spoonfuls of butter) in the Sru _k_ , and offers the\nVastoshpatiya (oblation) in the \xc3\x82havaniya fire according to (the rules of his)\nSutra. 13\n\np. 286\n\n14\\. Having recited the Puronuvakya (verse), 'O lord of the dwelling, permit\nus,' &c., he offers (the oblation) with the Ya _g_ ya verse, 'O lord of the\ndwelling, with thy kind company,' &c. 14\n\n15\\. Some (declare that) every person who has kindled the sacred fires (shall\noffer these Homas).\n\n16\\. Others (say that) a Yayavara alone (shall do it).\n\n17\\. After departing (from his house), he stops at the extremity of the\nvillage, or at the extremity of the boundary of the village, builds there a\nhut or a cottage, and enters that. 17\n\n18\\. Let him use the skin of the black antelope and the other (objects) which\nhe has prepared for the several purposes which they are intended to serve.\n\n19\\. Known (is) the (duty of) serving the fires; known (is) the (duty of)\noffering the new and full moon sacrifices; known (is) the successive\nperformance of the five Mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as; it is seen that the vegetables,\nwhich have been produced, are offered. 19\n\n20\\. He hallows those (vegetables), either (reciting the text),' I offer what\nis agreeable to all the gods,' or silently, and cooks (them). 20\n\np. 287\n\n21\\. For such (a man the duty of) teaching, sacrificing for others, accepting\ngifts, and (performing) other sacrifices (than those mentioned) ceases. 21\n\n22\\. (The use of) sacrificial food fit to be eaten during the performance of a\nvow is seen;\n\n23\\. That is as follows: (his food may be) mixed with clarified butter or sour\nmilk, (it must) not (contain) pungent condiments or salt, nor meat, nor (be)\nstale.\n\n24: (He shall remain) chaste, or approach (his wife) in season.\n\n25\\. (It is necessary) to have the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on\nhis body, and his nails cut on each Parva day, and the rules of purification\n(are obligatory on him).\n\n26\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Two kinds of purification,\nwhich the _S_ ish _t_ as reverentially practise, are mentioned in the Veda,--\nexternal (purification), which consists in the removal of impure stains and\nfoul smells, and internal (purification), which consists in the abstention\nfrom injuring live creatures.'\n\n27\\. 'The body is purified by water, the understanding by knowledge, the soul\nof beings by abstention from injuring, (and) the internal organ by truth.' 27\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[284:5](sbe1473.htm#fr_1329) **1**. Govinda says that _K_ akra _k_ ara is\nanother name for Yayavara, and that anukrama _k_ ara _n_ a, 'going by turns,'\nmeans going successively to the houses of Brahma _n_ as, Kshatriyas, and Vai\n_s_ yas.\n\n[284:7](sbe1473.htm#fr_1330) The terms left untranslated are fully explained\nin the next p. 285 chapter. All the MSS. read kauntali for kauddali, which\noccurs in the commentary alone.\n\n[285:11](sbe1473.htm#fr_1331) The vivadha, 'a yoke for carrying burdens,'\nconsists usually of a bamboo pole, to the ends of which two ropes are attached\nfor fastening the loads. Kuthahari, 'a sickle,' seems to be the name of a\nparticular kind of sickle, since Govinda explains it by vasavasasanadatram. He\nadds that the term includes 'a spade' (kuddala) and other implements.\n\n[285:12](sbe1473.htm#fr_1332) The meaning is that on the evening before his\ndeparture from the old home he is to offer the Traidhataviya-homa. According\nto the _S_ rauta-sutras (see the Petersb. Dict. s. v. traidhatavi) the latter\noffering always occurs at the end of a great sacrifice. Hence it is\nappropriate for a person who wishes to begin a new mode of life.\n\n[285:13](sbe1473.htm#fr_1333) This is the leave-taking from the old dwelling.\n\n[286:14](sbe1473.htm#fr_1334) The two verses occur Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita III,\n4, 10, I. It is specially mentioned by Saya _n_ a that the two verses have to\nbe recited by an Agnihotrin on departing from his home.\n\n[286:17](sbe1473.htm#fr_1335) Ma _th_ a, 'a cottage,' is, according to\nGovinda, a house resting on many posts or pillars, while ku _t_ i is the\nsimple shed with four posts and a roof of leaves.\n\n[286:19](sbe1473.htm#fr_1336) The last clause, probably, is meant to prescribe\na simpler form of the Vai _s_ vadeva.\n\n[286:20](sbe1473.htm#fr_1337) Govinda adds that the meaning is that the\nsacrificer shall eat the boiled rice in silence.\n\n[287:21](sbe1473.htm#fr_1338) Govinda adds that the obligation of performing\nother meritorious deeds, such as digging wells and tanks (purta), also ceases.\n\n[287:27](sbe1473.htm#fr_1339) Vasish _th_ a III, 60.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na III, Adhyaya 2](sbe1474.htm)\n\n"
