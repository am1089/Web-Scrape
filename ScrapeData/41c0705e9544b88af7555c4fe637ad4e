In the beginning this universe was Self alone; there was naught else open-\neyed. He bethought Himself: "Now I will create worlds!"\n\nHe created these worlds--the Ocean, the Light, the Dead, the Waters. That is\nthe Ocean which is beyond the heaven; the heaven is its foundation. The Light\nis the sky. The Dead is the Earth; the Waters are those beneath.\n\nHe bethought Himself: "There are the worlds; now I will create world-wardens!"\nHe drew from the waters Man, 2 and made him solid. He brooded over him. When\nhe had been brooded over, his mouth burst asunder like an egg; from his mouth\narose Speech, from speech Fire. His nostrils burst asunder; from his nostrils\narose the incoming Breath, from the\n\np. 57\n\n[paragraph continues] Breath Wind. His eyes burst asunder; from his eyes arose\nSight, from Sight the Sun. His ears burst asunder; from his ears arose\nHearing, from Hearing Space. His skin burst asunder; from his skin arose hair,\nfrom the hair plants and trees. His heart burst asunder; from his heart arose\nMind, from Mind the Moon. His navel burst asunder: from his navel arose the\noutgoing Breath, from the Breath Death. His secret parts burst asunder; from\nhis secret parts arose seed, from seed the Waters.\n\n2\\. These gods, having been created, fell into this great ocean; this He gave\nover to Hunger and Thirst. 1 They said to Him: "Find out for us a dwelling-\nplace in which we may rest and eat food." He brought them a cow. They said:\n"This is not enough for us." He brought them a horse. They said: "This is not\nenough for us." He brought them a man. They said: "Well done, forsooth!" For\nman is in sooth well done. He said to them: "Enter, each according to your\ndwelling-places." So Fire, becoming Speech, entered his mouth; Wind, becoming\nthe incoming Breath, entered his\n\np. 58\n\nnostrils; the Sun, becoming Sight, entered his eyes; Space, becoming Hearing,\nentered his ears; the Plants and Trees, becoming hair, entered his skin; the\nMoon, becoming Mind, entered his heart; Death, becoming the outgoing Breath,\nentered his navel; the Waters, becoming seed, entered his secret parts.\n\nHunger and Thirst said to Him: "Find out for us a dwelling-place." He said to\nthem: "I give you a share with these gods, I make you partners with them."\nTherefore it is that whosoever be the godhead for whom an offering is taken,\nHunger and Thirst are partners therein.\n\n3\\. He bethought Himself: "There are the worlds and the world-wardens; now I\nwill create for them Food."\n\nHe brooded over the waters; when they had been brooded over, there arose from\nthe waters a shape. The shape that arose was Food.\n\nWhen this was created, it sought to escape Him. He sought to seize it with\nSpeech, but could not; if He had seized it with Speech, one might have been\nfilled with food through speaking only. He sought to seize it with the\nincoming Breath, but could not; if He had seized it with the Breath, one might\nhave been filled with food through breathing only. He sought to seize it with\nthe Eye, but could not; if He had seized it with the Eye, one might have been\nfilled with food through sight only. He sought to seize it with the Ears\n\np. 59\n\nbut could not; if He had seized it with the Ear, one might have been filled\nwith food through hearing only. He sought to seize it with the Skin, but could\nnot; if He had seized it with the Skin, one might have been filled with food\nthrough touch only. He sought to seize it with the Mind, but could not; if He\nhad seized it with the Mind, one might have been filled with food through\nthinking only. He sought to seize it with the secret parts, but could not; if\nHe had seized it with the secret parts, one might have been filled with food\nthrough excretion only. He sought to seize it with the outgoing Breath, and He\nswallowed it. It is the Wind that grasps Food, the Wind that wins Food. 1\n\nHe bethought Himself: "How can this be without me?" He bethought Himself: "By\nwhat way shall I come in?" He bethought Himself: "If speaking is by speech,\nin-breathing by the in-breath, sight by the eye, hearing by the ear, touch by\nthe skin, thinking by the mind, out-breathing by the out-breath, excretion by\nthe secret parts, then who am I?" 2\n\nHe cleft asunder the crown of the head, and by that door came in. This door is\ncalled the "cleft"; it makes for bliss. 3\n\np. 60\n\nThree dwellings has He, and three dream-states --this is His dwelling, this\nHis dwelling, this His dwelling. [1](brk30.htm#fn_10)\n\nHaving been born, He surveyed living things. "What is here," said He, "that\none would call other [than Me]?" He saw man to be most utterly Brahma, and He\nsaid, _"idam_ _adar \xc5\x9bam"_ ("I have seen it"). Therefore He has the name _Idan-\ndra._ His name is indeed _Idan-dra;_ but him who is _Idan-dra_ men call\n_Indra,_  [2](brk30.htm#fn_11) in a dark manner; for the gods love what is\ndark.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[56:1](brk29.htm#fr_4) Aitareya Upanishad, i.\n\n[56:2](brk29.htm#fr_5) _Purusha;_ see above, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 4, 5, 7.\n\n[57:1](brk29.htm#fr_6) The cosmic powers, Fire, Wind, Sun, Space, Vegetation,\nMoon, Death, and Water (each of which is created from a corresponding function\nof the ideal Man) are in themselves powerless. They sink back into the\nprimitive waters, and suffer hunger and thirst; they must have a home in the\nreal Man in order to be satisfied and active. The forces of Nature exist only\nthrough and in the human subject\n\n[59:1](brk29.htm#fr_7) The outgoing breath, _ap \xc4\x81na,_ probably is here\nidentified with the function of digestion (p. 43). The rest of the sentence is\nbased upon a word-play.\n\n[59:2](brk29.htm#fr_8) For the answer to this question, see the next extract.\n\n[59:3](brk29.htm#fr_9) See above, \xc2\xa7 9.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II: Who am I?](brk30.htm)\n\n'
