SPECIFIC POSTURES FOR RELAXATION\n\nWhile the great majority of the _asanas_ have a curative or therapeutic value,\nthere are several which are purely for the purpose of relaxation. Relaxation\nshould not be mistaken for inertia. It is not a state of lethargy; rather, it\nis rest after effort or, perhaps, conscious rest after conscious effort. One\ndefinition of relaxation is "a complete resignation of the body to the power\nof gravity, surrender of the mind to nature, and the whole body energy being\ntransferred to a deep, dynamic breathing."\n\n#### Physical Relaxation\n\nComplete relaxation of the voluntary muscles at once transfers energy to\ninvoluntary parts so that, strictly speaking, there can be no such thing as\nrelaxation except in the voluntary muscles and brain. But this is quite\nsufficient! This transfer of energy by voluntary action and involuntary\nreaction produces the necessary equilibrium for the renewal of strength.\n\nIn many parts of the world, where human beings still\n\np. 57\n\ntransport heavy loads, it is amazing how far they can carry burdens that most\nindividuals could not even lift from the ground. Observation of porters in\nmany parts of the Orient and the Arabic world has shown that their endurance\nmay be due to the ability to relax. During long, heavy hauls, they often stop\nand lie down in apparently semi-lifeless states for as long as an hour. Then\nthey rise, refreshed, and resume their arduous journeys.\n\nProper, purposeful relaxation offers the greatest amount of renewed strength\nin the shortest length of time. After extended exertion or stress, perfect\nrest in the form of relaxation is the principle which revitalizes the nerve\ncenters, collects the scattered forces of energy and invigorates the body. The\nthree poses of Yoga for complete relaxation are _Dradhasana_ , _Shavasana_ and\n_Adhvasana_.\n\n#### Dradhasana, or Firm Pose\n\nThis is considered best for sleeping, as it is the most comfortable. To take\nthe pose, lie relaxed with your right arm under your head, using it as a\npillow. By lying passively on the right side, you favor emptying of the\nstomach and make breathing movements easier. In practice, it has been found\nthat sleeping in this manner generally inhibits dreams\n\n[![Dradhasana, or Firm Pose](tn/05700.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/05700.jpg)  \nDradhasana, or Firm Pose  \n\np. 58\n\nand nocturnal emissions and improves digestion. A short period of sleep\nbecomes the equivalent of a longer sleep for recuperative purposes. It is also\nrecommended for short periods of waking relaxation.\n\n#### Shavasana, or Corpse Pose\n\nThis is recommended for use when the student of Yoga experiences fatigue\nduring any of his exercises. This pose is described in the tracts as\n"destroying fatigue of the body; quieting the agitation of the mind." Lie face\nup with your feet extended. Remain motionless with a sense or feeling of\nsinking down like a corpse. Gradually relax every muscle of the body by\nconcentrating on each individually, from the tip of the toe to the end of the\nskull. Exercise absolute resignation of will by trying to forget the existence\nof your body and detaching yourself from it. Hold this posture until you feel\nrestored.\n\nMedical authorities have confirmed that the Shavasana pose brings about a fall\nin the blood pressure and pulse rate and establishes an even rate of\nrespiration. If this pose is kept for more than ten minutes, the deepened\nrespiration and lowered circulation in the brain will probably bring about a\ntendency to sleep.\n\n[![Shavasana, or Corpse Pose](tn/05800.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/05800.jpg)  \nShavasana, or Corpse Pose  \n\np. 59\n\n#### Adhavasana, or Relaxed Pose\n\nLie down with your head on your folded arms, as if on a pillow, and\nconcentrate as in Shavasana. Relax all your muscles. Then stretch your hands\nand legs out fully, and permit the power of gravity to take over the weight of\nyour body as you relax every voluntary muscle.\n\n[![Adhavasana, or Relaxed Pose](tn/05900.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/05900.jpg)  \nAdhavasana, or Relaxed Pose  \n\n#### Mental Relaxation\n\nAnother group of _asanas_ , or postures, specifically provides for the care of\nthe nervous system. These exercises have been found to be especially helpful\nto persons of a neurasthenic condition. An individual in this state will be\nmentally vague, lack determination, and have continual feelings of\ninferiority, fatigue and distraction, accompanied by a state of anxiety. Lack\nof will power and other forms of nervous or mental debility are all\nindications of a lack of tonicity in the brain-nervous system.\n\nIn many ways, symptoms of the neurasthenic are similar to those of an older\nperson who is approaching or has reached senility. Yoga investigators feel\nthat the condition may be\n\np. 60\n\ndue to a degeneration of the nerve cells with resultant subnormal functions.\nWhile the Yoga process may not reverse the situation in the case of an aged\nperson, it has resulted in relief for neurasthenics of young and middle age.\nIn addition, the normal person who utilizes these _asanas_ will find that he\nderives from them a new keenness of mind and an ability to utilize his nerve-\nenergy to the utmost for whatever personal goals he may have set for himself.\n\n#### Bhujangasana, or Snake Pose\n\nThe anterior and posterior stretching offered by the Snake Pose are said to be\nideal spinal exercises, preserving or restoring tonicity in the spinal column\nand nervous channels. Lie on your stomach, with your legs stretched and toes\npointed outward. Keep your arms at your sides, with palms down, and your\nforehead on the floor. Then, slowly raise your head and neck upward and\nbackward.\n\nWhen your head and neck are slightly raised, plant your hands on both sides of\nthe abdomen. Inhale, and gradually raise your thorax and the upper part of\nyour abdomen by increasing the angle between your hands and rising shoulders.\nFrom the navel downward, your body should remain fixed to the ground. Only the\nupper portion of your body should be raised. In some texts, this pose is\ncalled the "Like a hooded cobra striking" pose. Work toward this pose\ngradually, avoiding muscular strain or "jerkiness" in your efforts to raise\nthe upper part of your body. As you practice this pose, you will feel the\npressure on your spinal column gradually working down the vertebrae until you\nfeel a deep pressure at the coccyx.\n\nAt first, concentrate on the posture. Having achieved the\n\np. 61\n\n[![Bhujangasana, or Snake Pose](tn/06100.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/06100.jpg)  \nBhujangasana, or Snake Pose  \n\ncorrect pose, exhale and return to the starting position. Lower yourself\nslowly. In contrast to the pressure which you felt as you entered this\nposture, you will experience a feeling of relief along your spine as you lower\nyourself. This _asana_ should not be utilized by women during menstruation or\nadvanced pregnancy, or by men suffering from hernia. Persons with a weak\nphysical structure should approach this _asana_ slowly and drop it if they\nfind it too arduous. It may be attempted later when the other muscle-tone\n_asanas_ have shown their effects.\n\nAfter the pose has been mastered, follow this procedure: (1) Raise thorax and\ninhale for three seconds; (2) maintain pose, retaining your breath for six\nseconds; (3) return to starting position, while exhaling for three seconds;\n(4) repeat five times in a minute.\n\nIt is suggested that the Snake Pose be practiced for at least a month, by\nwhich time its effects should be felt. Practice it daily, preferably in the\nevening before dinner.\n\np. 62\n\n#### Halasana, or Plough Pose\n\nThe Snake Pose is actually the first of a linked pair of postures, the second\nbeing the Halasana, or Plough Pose. This pose should be undertaken when you\nare fully rested. To start, lie on the floor with your face upward and arms\nresting at your sides, palms downward. Then raise your legs together, slowly\ninhaling until your legs are brought at a right angle to the body. Next, while\nexhaling slowly, raise your hips and lower your legs beyond your head. Keep\nyour legs together and straight. As you become practiced in this posture,\nstretch your toes further and further beyond your head. If you find this\nposture too difficult, keep your legs folded or bent and raise them as high as\nyou can. Practice in the following manner: (1) Raise legs to a right angle\nwith body and inhale for two seconds; (2) lower legs beyond head and exhale\nfor two seconds; (3) maintain pose for four seconds while suspending breath;\n(4) return to starting position, while inhaling slowly for two seconds.\n\nDo not overdo this posture. At first try it once daily, then, as it becomes\neasier, work toward the completion of six rounds in a minute. It may be easier\nat first in the evening, when the body is more supple. When perfected, it\nshould be practiced in the morning on an empty stomach. Those who are\nextremely overweight may find this pose impossible, as will those with stiff\nmuscles. Also, it is not recommended for those with any form of hernia. In\naddition to its cerebro-nervous system therapy, this pose is highly effective\nin ridding the body and nervous systems of toxic accumulations and its\nperfection and regular use will aid largely in achieving purification of the\nnervous-energy channels.\n\np. 63\n\n[![Halasana, or Plough Pose](tn/06300.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/06300.jpg)  \nHalasana, or Plough Pose  \n\n[![A variation of the Plough Pose, with arms under head.](tn/06301.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/06301.jpg)  \nA variation of the Plough Pose, with arms under head.  \n\np. 64\n\n#### Ultrasana, or Camel Pose\n\nThis is the climactic pose of the series suggested for nerve-spinal\nadjustment. Generally it is impossible to achieve before the two previous\nposes have been perfected. Kneel and while supporting your body on your toes\ngradually lean backward, after fixing your arms behind you, with your palms to\nthe ground, fingers pointed outward and thumbs toward your toes. Keeping your\narms straight, slowly lift your hips while inhaling. Then, push your body\nabove the waist slowly outward and upward, throwing your neck downward. As you\ncome into this posture, you should feel the pressure traveling upward toward\nyour shoulders and neck,\n\n[![Ultrasana, or Camel Pose](tn/06400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/06400.jpg)  \nUltrasana, or Camel Pose  \n\np. 65\n\nfinally reaching your neck and facial muscles. It is suggested that this pose\nbe practiced in the morning, but not more than once daily. In timing, the\nbody-lift should take three seconds with inhalation; retention, six seconds;\nreturn to kneeling position while exhaling, three seconds.\n\n#### TIME SCHEDULE FOR PRACTICING THE ASANAS\n\nThe time schedule has been established to enable the person of ordinary\nmuscular development to follow a routine of Yogic exercises. After reading the\ntext and gradually taking the step-by-step procedure for the postures and\nexercises, you should make a copy of this chart and place it on the wall of\nthe room in which you practice the _asanas_. Do not overdo, as the Yoga\nexercises are designed for a gradual program of improvement. This is not an\neasy, one-day course.\n\nThose who have been reading popular articles on Yoga may notice that there are\nno standing-on-head _asanas_ recommended. Those, and the other drastic\n_asanas_ , may actually be harmful unless they are preceded by a full program\nof physical preparation under a competent teacher of Yoga. The sequence\nrecommended here goes from easy to difficult movements, and will exercise\nalternate sets of muscles. Where breathing routines are shown with the _asana_\n, it is of utmost importance that they be followed closely for maximum\nbenefits.\n\nIn a few months the benefits of this program will be evident and the\nexercises, diet and mental therapy suggested in this book should be made a\nlifetime project.\n\np. 66\n\n\n\n|\n\n_Asanas_\n\n|\n\n_Time_  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n1.\n\n|\n\nStitha-Prarthanasana (Prayer Pose)\n\n|\n\n1 Minute  \n  \n2.\n\n|\n\nPadmasana (Lotus Pose)\n\n|\n\n1 Minute  \n  \n3.\n\n|\n\nYastikasana (Stick Pose)\n\n|\n\n1 Minute  \n  \n4.\n\n|\n\nParvatasana (Mountain Pose)\n\n|\n\n2 Minutes  \n  \n5.\n\n|\n\nTrikonasana and Variant (Triangle Pose)\n\n|\n\n2 Minutes  \n  \n6.\n\n|\n\nGarudasana (Eagle Pose)\n\n|\n\n2 Minutes  \n  \n7.\n\n|\n\nHastapadangustasana (Toe-Finger Pose)\n\n|\n\n1 Minute  \n  \n8.\n\n|\n\nHastapadasana (Hand-Leg Pose)\n\n|\n\n1 Minute  \n  \n9.\n\n|\n\nEkapadasana (One-Leg Pose)\n\n|\n\n_1 Minute  _  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nTotal Daily Exercise\n\n|\n\n12 Minutes  \n  \nPlease note that a woman in advanced pregnancy should avoid all but the first\ntwo exercises.
