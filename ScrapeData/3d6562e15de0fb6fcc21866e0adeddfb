SPECIFIC ASANAS FOR WEIGHT REDUCTION\n\nThe slim, svelte figure is a goal of our culture, especially for the female\nsex, so that the next series of _asanas_ may be of particular interest to\nwomen. From the point of view of Hatha Yoga, the elimination of excess fat has\nbeen one means of achieving body-mind harmony. Even before modern insurance\nactuaries pointed out the correlation between excess weight and high\nmortality, Yogis had determined that every pound of weight above normal\n(particularly for persons over forty) shortens life by one year. While many\npersons have ruined their health and even courted death by attempts to lose\nweight through chemical pills or starvation diets, the Yoga reducing method\nimproves body tone while it trims excess poundage. One of the goals of Hatha\nYoga is _mrnalakomalavapu_ , or the slimness of a lotus stalk.\n\nRecent medical findings on overweight, which were also foreshadowed by the\nYogins, indicate that the accumulation of body fat is a symptom rather than a\ndisease. In the great majority of cases, obesity is due to psychological\nrather than physical causes. In a small number of persons, obesity may result\nfrom faulty or subnormal functioning of the endocrine\n\np. 50\n\nglands. However, most fat people owe their condition to overnutrition or\nunderoxidation of the food consumed, or a combination of both. Unused\nsurpluses of ingested food are deposited in the body tissues as fat, and\naccumulate in those parts of the body which are least affected by muscular\naction. Fatty deposits in certain parts of the body may not be too noticeable,\nbut deposits in the area of the hips and abdomen are both unsightly and\ndifficult to remove by ordinary means. Everyone has heard the complaint of the\ndieter that "my face looks thinner, but the fat stays on my hips and stomach!"\n\nAnother aspect of obesity which is generally overlooked by the reducing\nfaddist and the Western exercise "schools" is that improper elimination is a\ngreat contributor to stoutness. One of the basic objectives of the Yoga\npostures in the reducing regime is to exercise the trunk and mid-trunk. At\nYoga institutes in India it has been found that the first successful step in\nthe removal of excess fat is to combat constipation by eliminating the use of\nlaxatives and substituting proper Yoga exercises. These postures and\nmovements, which massage internally and invigorate the muscles and walls of\nthe abdomen, have been found to be successful in the treatment of cases of\nfunctional and chronic constipation.\n\nWhile the Yoga postures discussed above enhance tonicity of the extremities,\nhygiene of the trunk is important for general good health and is especially\nimportant for tense or obese persons. The daily postural exercises already\ndescribed will supply adequate tonicity to the thorax. However, special\nattention is needed for the abdomen and the waist. Abdominal tonicity can be\nachieved in two ways: by systematic exercise of abdominal muscles by anterior\nand posterior movements, and through mechanical effects on the inner muscles\nby intra-abdominal compression.\n\np. 51\n\n#### Hastapadangustasana, or Toe-Finger Pose\n\nThe Toe-Finger Pose offers a variation for forward and sideward movements.\nStand erect with your legs straight, chest thrown forward and hands at your\nsides. While exhaling, slowly raise one leg straight forward, until it is at a\nright angle to your body. Avoid bending your knee. Balancing your body on one\nleg, stretch your arms forward, and either touch or take hold of the raised\nleg with the fingers of one or both hands. Maintain this position for only a\nfew seconds at first, during suspension of breath. Inhale while returning to\nthe starting position.\n\n[![With practice, you\'ll be able to straighten your leg completely in the Toe-\nFinger Pose.](tn/05100.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/05100.jpg)  \nWith practice, you\'ll be able to straighten your leg completely in the Toe-\nFinger Pose.  \n\np. 52\n\nRepeat this posture three times in one minute, lifting each leg alternately.\nFor best effects, do it in the morning. To establish harmony between motion\nand breathing: (1) Raise leg forward and exhale for two seconds; (2) maintain\npose as shown in illustration and exhale for four seconds; (3) return to\nstarting position and inhale for two seconds.\n\nA variation of this pose is to raise your leg sideways instead of forward.\nOther movements remain unchanged. If you are unaccustomed to exercise, start\nby lifting your leg without attempting to touch or hold your toes.\n\n[![Hastapadangustasana, or Toe-Finger Pose](tn/05200.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/05200.jpg)  \nHastapadangustasana, or Toe-Finger Pose  \n\np. 53\n\nYou will probably find that in the early stages your fingers cannot be made to\ntouch your toes, or that your knee tends to bend. Try to rectify these errors\neach time you practice the posture. If, however, you feel muscular strain,\nplace your hands on your hips and practice the leg movements with the\nappropriate breathing. An analysis of the benefits of this pose shows that the\nflexion of the hip, followed by exhalation, increases abdominal compression.\nIn addition, slow, steady, alternate movements provide a mild internal massage\nto the viscera by utilizing the muscles and tendons of the normally inactive\nlower abdomen and hips.\n\n#### Hastapadasana, or Hand-Leg Pose\n\nConsistent practice of the Toe-Finger Pose should improve the flexion of your\nhips. As this proceeds, you should also try to increase the intra-abdominal\npressure through an exercise which induces maximum stretch of the posterior\nmuscles. This may be achieved by utilizing the Yoga Hand-Leg Pose, or\nHastapadasana, and its variations.\n\nStart this pose with the now-familiar Triangle Pose, standing erect with your\nfeet together. Next bend forward at a right angle, while reaching your toes.\nTry to keep your feet together and your knees straight. To obtain the hygienic\nbenefits of this posture, it is essential to keep your legs straight.\n\nWith your legs straight, exhale and bend forward from the waist slowly. The\naim is to be able to hold your ankles with your hands, keeping your head\npointed downward. Maintain this position for a few seconds, while suspending\nyour breath. Then return to the starting position, while exhaling. (1) Bend\nforward, reaching the toes, and exhale for\n\np. 54\n\n[![Hastapadasana, or Hand-Leg Pose](tn/05400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/05400.jpg)  \nHastapadasana, or Hand-Leg Pose  \n\ntwo seconds; (2) maintain pose for four seconds, while suspending your breath;\n(3) return to starting position and inhale for two seconds. Repeat the\nexercise with a two-second pause after each movement. Complete four rounds in\none minute.\n\nGrasping your ankles will be difficult in the beginning, but with regular\npractice it will become easier. When you can comfortably hold your ankles\ntightly, try to fold your arms near the elbows. Then draw your head closer to\nyour knees. This practice should be continued for several weeks. Finally, try\nto rest your forehead between your thighs just above your knees. Try this pose\nwith slow, normal breathing at first, especially if you plan to hold it for\nmore than four\n\np. 55\n\nseconds. As a precaution, do not breathe in deeply during this pose, for there\nis a possibility that this could injure the delicate internal organs which are\nnow in a condition of intra-abdominal pressure.\n\nThis is probably the first really difficult posture that you have attempted.\nFor the best results, allow a fairly long time for the completion of the\nposture. Keep in mind that the goal is not to become proficient at holding the\npose, but to acquire the benefits of regular practice. Undue effort that\ncauses muscular strain or a feeling of personal inadequacy will be harmful. A\nposture which cannot be achieved in the morning may often be attained in the\nevening, since the day-long use of the body may make the limbs and trunk more\nsupple. Women should not practice this posture or any other which involves\nintra-abdominal pressure during the first three days of menstruation or during\npregnancy.\n\n#### Purpose of These Poses\n\nThe benefits derived from the poses just discussed result from their twofold\naction. They effectively stretch the posterior muscles which support the\nabdomen, hips and waist, thus increasing the tone of the abdominal and pelvic\norgans. They also help to loosen and reduce unhealthy and unnecessary fatty\ntissue. Above all, they effectively reduce constipation and induce natural,\nregular elimination. Much tenseness and stress is not due to the pressures of\noutside influences or nerves, but results from bodily discomfort because\nnatural functions are hampered. The noxious effect of autointoxication is\ncaused by a lack of proper tonicity. This is what the Yoga postures and\nexercises can overcome if followed faithfully\xc2\x97the achievement of "mens sana in\ncorpore sano"\xc2\x97a sound mind in a sound body.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 7.
