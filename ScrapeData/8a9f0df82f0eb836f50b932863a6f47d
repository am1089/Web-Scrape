Having gone out of the village in an easterly or in a northerly direction,\nand having put wood on the fire at a place where four roads meet, he should\nsacrifice (those fried grains) with his joined hands, with the single (verses\nof the text), 'Hearken, Raka!' (MB. II, 6, 2-5).\n\n3\\. Walking eastward (he should), looking upwards, (offer a Bali) to the hosts\nof divine beings, with (the formula), 'Be a giver of wealth' (ibid. 6);\n\n4. 4 (Walking?) towards the side, (he should offer a Bali) to the hosts of other beings, looking downwards.\n\n5. 5 Returning (to the fire) without looking back, he should, together with the persons belonging to his\n\np. 125\n\nfamily, as far as they have been initiated (by the Upanayana), eat the fried\ngrains.\n\n6\\. (This ceremony) procures happiness.\n\n7. 7 (With the two formulas), 'Obeying the will' and ' _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kha' (MB. II, 6, 7. 8), he should sacrifice two oblations of rice and of barley separately,\n\n8. 8 With reference to a person whose favour he wishes to gain.\n\n9\\. This is done daily.\n\n10. 10 With the Ekaksharya verse (MB. II. 6, 9) two rites (are performed) which are connected with the observance (of fasting) for a fortnight.\n\n11\\. One who is desirous of long life, should sacrifice (with that verse), in\nthe night of the full moon, one hundred pegs of Khadira wood;\n\n12\\. Of iron, if he desires that (his enemies) may be killed.\n\n13\\. Now another ceremony (performed with the same verse).\n\n14\\. Having gone out of the village in an easterly or in a northerly\ndirection, he should at a place where four roads meet, or on a mountain, set\nan elevated surface, consisting of the dung of beasts of the forest, on fire,\nshould sweep the coals away, and should make an oblation of butter (on that\nsurface) with his mouth, repeating that Mantra in his mind.\n\np. 126\n\n15\\. If (that oblation of butter) catches fire, twelve villages (will be his).\n\n16\\. If smoke rises, at least three.\n\n17\\. They call this ceremony one which is not in vain.\n\n18. 18 One who desires that his means of livelihood may not be exhausted, should sacrifice green cow-dung in the evening and in the morning.\n\n19. 19 Of articles which he has bought, he should, after having fasted three (days and) nights, make an oblation with the formula, 'Here this Vi _s_ vakarman' (MB. II. 6, 10).\n\n20\\. Of a garment he should offer some threads (with that formula),\n\n21\\. Of a cow some hairs (of its tail);\n\n22\\. In the same way (he should offer some part) of other articles which he\nhas bought.\n\n23. 23 The sacrifice of a full oblation (with the verse, 'A full oblation I sacrifice,' MB. II, 6, 11) should be performed on the sacrificial day (i.e. on the first day of the fortnight),\n\n24\\. And (on such a day let him sacrifice) with (the formula), 'Indramavadat\n(?)' (MB. II, 6, 12).\n\n25\\. One who is desirous of glory, (should offer) the first (oblation); one\nwho is desirous of companions, the second.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[124:1](sbe30040.htm#fr_431) 8, 1.
