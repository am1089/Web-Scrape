Of the other also there is thus non-clinging; but at death.\n\nIt has been said that, owing to knowledge, earlier and subsequent sins do not\ncling and are destroyed. The same holds good also with regard to the other,\ni.e. to good works--they also, owing to knowledge, do not cling and are\ndestroyed; for there is the same antagonism between knowledge and the fruit of\nthose works, and Scripture moreover expressly declares this. Thus we read,\n'Day and night do not pass that bank--neither good nor evil deeds. All sins\nturn back from it' ( _Kh_. Up.VIII, 4, 1); 'He shakes off his good and evil\ndeeds' (Kau. Up. I, 4). In the former of these texts good works are expressly\ndesignated as 'sin' because their fruits also are something not desirable for\nhim who aims at Release; there is some reason for doing this because after all\ngood works are enjoined by Scripture and their fruits are desired by men, and\nthey hence might be thought not to be opposed to knowledge.--But even to him\nwho possesses the knowledge of Brahman, the fruits of good deeds--such as\nseasonable rain, good crops, &c.--are desirable because they enable him to\nperform his meditations in due form; how then can it be said that knowledge is\nantagonistic to them and destroys them?--Of this point the Sutra disposes by\nmeans of the clause 'but on death.' Good works which produce results\nfavourable to knowledge and meditation perish only on the death of the body\n(not during the lifetime of the Devotee).--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a\nof 'the other.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15.
