Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus making a firm resolve that there would be\neither victory or death, the great warrior Nis\xc2\x92umbha went to fight with the\nDevi, with great excitement and with all his forces. S\xc2\x92umbha, too the Lord of\nthe Daityas, accompanied by his forces, went after Nis\xc2\x92umbha; S\xc2\x92umbha knew\nfull well the rules of warfare; therefore he remained a witness there. Indra\nand the other Devas and Yak _s_ as, all stationed themselves in the celestial\nspace, eager to see that fight, covered with clouds. Nis\xc2\x92umbha came to the\nfield, and, taking the strong bow made of horns, began to shoot arrows after\narrows at the Divine Mother with the object of frightening Her. Seeing\nNis\xc2\x92umbha with his excellent bow, shooting arrows, Cha _nd_ ika began to laugh\nfrequently. With a soft slow voice She spoke to Kalika :-- \xc2\x93O Kali! See their\nfoolishness! They have come before me, courting death. They are so much\ndeluded by My Maya, that they yet expect victory when they have already\nwitnessed the death of Raktabija and many Danavas. Hope is so very strong that\nit never quits a man. How wonderful is this that some of their armies are\ndestroyed, some are wounded, some are rendered senseless, some made powerless,\nsome have fled; seeing all these, yet, they have come to fight, as it were,\nfastened by the cord of hope of victory. O Kali! Today I will certainly slay\nNis\xc2\x92umbha and S\xc2\x92umbha. Their death is nigh; deluded by the Daivi Maya, they\nhave come to Me. Therefore, in the face of all the Devas, I will kill them\ntoday.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n11-24. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus saying, and suddenly drawing Her bow, Cha\n_nd_ i covered Nis\xc2\x92umbha, in front, all over with a multitude of arrows.\nNis\xc2\x92umbha, too, cut off those arrows into pieces by his sharp arrows; thus the\nfight became more and more dreadful between them. At this time, the lion of\nBhagavati, came down upon the forces, quivering his manes, like a powerful\nelephant going down into a lake. By his nails and teeth, he tore asunder the\nbodies of the Danavas that fell before him and devoured them, as if they were\ninfatuated elephants. That lion thus crushing down the soldiers, Nis\xc2\x92umbha\ncame forward hurriedly, drawing his excellent bow. Hundreds of other generals\nof the Danavas came up there to kill the Devi, biting their lips and with\ntheir eyes reddened with anger. In the meantime S\xc2\x92umbha killed Kalika and came\nvery hurriedly there with his forces to capture the Divine Mother. Coming to\nthe battlefield S\xc2\x92umbha saw that the Divine Mother was\n\n\n\np. 459\n\n\n\nstanding before him; though She was looking very beautiful, fit for love\nsentiment, yet She was filled also with the sentiment of fiery wrath. At that\ntime the large eyes of Bhagavati, the Beautiful in the three worlds, though\nnaturally red, looked more red due to wrath. When S\xc2\x92umbha saw Her lovely\nfeatures, the desire to marry Her and the hope of victory all vanished away\nfrom his mind; and he stood there with bow in his hand, firmly holding in his\nmind that he would die. Seeing the Danava in that state, She smiled and began\nto say, so that all the Danavas could hear. O Wretched Fools! If you all want\nto live, quit all your weapons here, go to the Patala or to the middle of the\nocean. Or be slain in the battle by My arrows and go to heavens and enjoy\nthere without any fear all the enjoyments and sports there. Weakness and\nheroism, both cannot be expected at one and the same time and at the same\nindividual; therefore I am ordering you to dispel your fears. Now go wherever\nyou find your ease and happiness.\n\n\n\n25-35. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing these words of the Devi, that haughty\nNis\xc2\x92umbha ran forward, holding in his hand the sharpened axe and shield\nadorned with eight Cha _nd_ ras (embossed) and firstly struck with sword\nviolently on the proud lion; then, whirling with great force that sword,\nhurled it upon the Divine Mother. The Devi, then, thwarted off the blow of the\nsword by Her club and struck at his arm by Paras\xc2\x92u. The warrior Nis\xc2\x92umbha,\nthus struck at his arm, patiently bore that hurt and struck at Cha _nd_ ika by\nhis axe. The Devi then made such a terrible noise of bells that all the\nDaityas were struck with terror. Then She, desiring to kill Nis\xc2\x92umbha, began\nto drink nectar frequently. O King! Thus the terrible fight went on between\nthe Devas and Danavas both trying to defeat the other party. Then began to\ndance in the battlefield, the cruel voracious dogs, jackals, vultures, herons,\ncrows and other birds, very much gladdened. The battlefield was drenched with\nblood and the dead carcasses of innumerable Danavas, elephants, and horses.\nNis\xc2\x92umbha, then, seeing the Danavas dead on the field, became very angry and\nran forward with his terrible club before the Devi. That proud Asura struck\nfirst at the head of the lion with that club and laughed again and again and\nstruck the Devi with that same club. The Devi, too, got very angry seeing\nNis\xc2\x92umbha before Her and striking\n\nat Her. She then spoke thus :--\n\n\n\n36\\. O You Stupid! Wait till I sever your head from your body by this axe.\nSoon you will be sent unto death with your head severed off your body.\n\n\n\n37-64. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus saying the Cha _nd_ ika Devi instantly cut\noff the head of Nis\xc2\x92umbha by Her axe with great caution.\n\n\n\np. 460\n\n\n\nThe head thus severed from the body by the blow of the Devi, the headless\nDemon began to roam there with great force with club in his hand. The Devas\nthen got very much frightened; The Devi, then, cut off the hands and feet of\nthat headless Demon with sharpened arrows. That vicious wretch fell down\nlifeless, on the ground like a mountain. The powerful Daitya Nis\xc2\x92umbha being\nthus killed, a great uproar arose amidst his panic stricken forces. The\nsoldiers, covered all over their bodies with blood, left all their weapons in\nthe field, began to make Boomba sound (a piteous cry with mouth and hands as\nsign of danger) and fled away to the King S\xc2\x92umbha. He, the tormentor of the\nfoes, then asked them coming :-- \xc2\x93Where is Nis\xc2\x92umbha now? Why have you fled\naway from the field?\xc2\x94 Thus hearing the King\xc2\x92s words, they bowed down and said\n:-- O King! Your brother Nis\xc2\x92umbha is lying dead on the battlefield. O King!\nThe Devi killed all the Danava warriors that attended your brother; only we\nare left and have come here to give you the information. O King! Nis\xc2\x92umbha has\nbeen killed by the weapons of the Devi. So we think you ought not to go to the\nbattle. Know this as certain that the Lady, the Highest Cause of this Universe\nhas come here to destroy the Danavas, the object being to serve the cause of\nthe Gods. This Lady is not an ordinary woman; She is the Supreme Force; Her\ndoings are inconceivable; what more can be said than the fact that the Devas\nnever can know Her! This Devi can assume various forms; She is the origin of\nMaya; She is very clever; She is adorned with various ornaments and is holding\nvarious weapons in Her hands. Her doings are incomprehensible; She is like a\nSecond Night of Dissolution (at the end of the world); She is Perfect, endowed\nwith all auspicious signs, capable to go beyond the insurmountable. This\nwonderful Devi is serving the cause of the gods and the Devas from the sky are\nsinging hymns to Her. O King! It is now your paramount duty to fly away and\nsave your life; if you live, you may have the chance for gaining the victory\nwhen time will turn out favourable; there is no doubt in this. It is Time that\nmakes a strong man weak; and it is that very Time that makes that weak man\nstrong again and stimulates him for victory. Time makes a generous donor a\nbeggar and it is Time that makes the same beggar again a generous donor.\nBrahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes\xc2\x92a, Indra and other Devas are all under the sway of\nthis Time; so Time is the Sovereign of all. Therefore, O King! Wait for this\nTime. Now Time is favourable to the Gods and inimical to you. Therefore Time\nis destroying now the Daityas. But the course of Time is not the same\nthroughout. O King! The actions of Time are various no doubt. Time creates men\nand Time destroys them. The time of\n\n\n\np. 461\n\n\n\ncreation is different from the time of destruction, this is evident to you\nbefore your eyes. See! When Time was favourable to you, you subject Indra and\nall other Devas and made them pay taxes to you; and now Time is unfavourable\nto you; so an ordinary weak woman is killing the powerful Danavas; Time,\ntherefore, is doing favourable things and also unfavourable things. The host\nof Devas or the woman Kali is not the cause thereof. O King! The present Time\nis not favourable to you and the Daityas; knowing this, do as you like. See!\nIndra, Vi _sn_ u, Varu _n_ a, Yama and other prominent Devas all fled before\nin battle, quitting the weapons. So, knowing this world as subject to the\ncontrol of Time, you can now fly away and go quickly to the Patala. For if you\nlive, you will get in future all the pleasures; and if you be killed, your\nenemies will all be very glad and roam everywhere fearlessly, singing\npropitious songs.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirtieth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the killing of Nis\xc2\x92umbha\nin S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000 verses by Mahar\n_s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 31](bk05ch31.htm)\n\n'
