If it be said that (the soul) is not atomic, on account of scriptural\nstatement of (what is) not that; we say no, on account of the other one being\nthe topic.\n\nThe passage 'He who is within the heart, surrounded by the Pra _n_ as, the\nperson consisting of knowledge' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 7) introduces as the topic\nof discussion the personal Self, and further on in the same chapter we read\n'the unborn Self, the great one' (IV, 4, 22). The personal Self, being\nexpressly called _great_ , cannot, therefore, be atomic!--Not so, we reply.\n'Since the other one is the topic.' In the second text quoted that Self which\nis other than the personal Self--i.e. the highest Self (pra _g \xc3\xb1_a)\nconstitutes the topic. In the beginning of the chapter, indeed, the individual\nSelf is introduced, but later on, between the two texts quoted, the\ninstruction begins to concern itself with the highest Self, 'he by whom there\nis known the Self of intelligence' (pratibuddha atma; IV, 4, 13). It is this\nlatter Self which, in 22 is called _great_ , not the individual Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 23. And on account of the very word, and of measure](sbe48269.htm)\n\n"
