Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya came to _G_ anaka Vaideha, and he did not mean to speak\nwith him 1. But when formerly\n\np. 162\n\n[paragraph continues] _G_ anaka Vaideha and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya had a\ndisputation on the Agnihotra, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya had granted him a boon, and\nhe chose (for a boon) that he might be free to ask him any question he liked.\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya granted it, and thus the King was the first to ask him a\nquestion.\n\n2\\. \'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,\' he said, \'what is the light of man 1?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'The sun, O King; for, having the sun alone for\nhis light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.\'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'So indeed it is, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\'\n\n3\\. _G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'When the sun has set, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, what\nis then the light of man?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'The moon indeed is his light; for, having the\nmoon alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.\'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'So indeed it is, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\'\n\n4\\. _G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'When the sun has set, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, and\nthe moon has set, what is the light of man?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'Fire indeed is his light;\n\np. 163\n\nfor, having fire alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work,\nand returns.\'\n\n5\\. _G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'When the sun has set, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, and\nthe moon has set, and the fire is gone out, what is then the light of man?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'Sound indeed is his light; for, having sound\nalone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.\nTherefore, O King, when one cannot see even one\'s own hand, yet when a sound\nis raised, one goes towards it.\'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'So indeed it is, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\'\n\n6\\. _G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'When the sun has set, O Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, and\nthe moon has set, and the fire is gone out, and the sound hushed, what is then\nthe light of man?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'The Self indeed is his light; for, having the Self\nalone as his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.\'\n\n7\\. _G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'Who is that Self?\'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya replied: \'He who is within the heart, surrounded by the Pra\n_n_ as 1 (senses), the person of light, consisting of knowledge. He, remaining\nthe same, wanders along the two worlds 2, as if 3 thinking, as if moving.\nDuring sleep (in dream) he transcends this world and all the forms of death\n(all that falls under the sway of death, all that is perishable).\n\n8\\. \'On being born that person, assuming his body,\n\np. 164\n\nbecomes united with all evils; when he departs and dies, he leaves all evils\nbehind.\n\n9\\. \'And there are two states for that person, the one here in this world, the\nother in the other world, and as a third 1 an intermediate state, the state of\nsleep. When in that intermediate state, he sees both those states together,\nthe one here in this world, and the other in the other world. Now whatever his\nadmission to the other world may be, having gained that admission, he sees\nboth the evils and the blessings 2.\n\n\'And when he falls asleep, then after having taken away with him the material\nfrom the whole world, destroying 3 and building it up again, he sleeps\n(dreams) by his own light. In that state the person is self-illuminated.\n\n10\\. \'There are no (real) chariots in that state, no horses, no roads, but he\nhimself sends forth (creates) chariots, horses, and roads. There are no\nblessings there, no happiness, no joys, but he himself sends forth (creates)\nblessings, happiness, and joys. There\n\np. 165\n\nare no tanks there, no lakes, no rivers, but he himself sends forth (creates)\ntanks, lakes, and rivers. He indeed is the maker.\n\n11\\. \'On this there are these verses:\n\n\'After having subdued by sleep all that belongs to the body, he, not asleep\nhimself, looks down upon the sleeping (senses). Having assumed light, he goes\nagain to his place, the golden person 1, the lonely bird. (1)\n\n12\\. \'Guarding with the breath (pra _n_ a, life) the lower nest, the immortal\nmoves away from the nest; that immortal one goes wherever he likes, the golden\nperson, the lonely bird. (2)\n\n13\\. \'Going up and down in his dream, the god makes manifold shapes for\nhimself, either rejoicing together with women, or laughing (with his friends),\nor seeing terrible sights. (3)\n\n14\\. \'People may see his playground 2 but himself no one ever sees. Therefore\nthey say, Let no one wake a man suddenly, for it is not easy to remedy, if he\ndoes not get back (rightly to his body)."\n\n\'Here some people (object and) say: "No, this (sleep) is the same as the place\nof waking, for what he sees while awake, that only he sees when asleep 3."\n\np. 166\n\nNo, here (in sleep) the person is self-illuminated (as we explained before).\'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'I give you, Sir, a thousand. Speak on for the sake of\n(my) emancipation.\'\n\n15\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'That (person) having enjoyed himself in that\nstate of bliss (samprasada, deep sleep), having moved about and seen both good\nand evil, hastens back again as he came, to the place from which he started\n(the place of sleep), to dream 1. And whatever he may have seen there, he is\nnot followed (affected) by it, for that person is not attached to anything.\'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'So it is indeed, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\n\np. 167\n\n[paragraph continues] I give you, Sir, a thousand. Speak on for the sake of\nemancipation.\'\n\n16\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'That (person) having enjoyed himself in that\nsleep (dream), having moved about and seen both good and evil, hastens back\nagain as he came, to the place from which he started, to be awake. And\nwhatever he may have seen there, he is not followed (affected) by it, for that\nperson is not attached to anything.\'\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'So it is indeed, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya. I give you, Sir,\na thousand. Speak on for the sake of emancipation.\'\n\n17\\. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'That (person) having enjoyed himself in that\nstate of waking, having moved about and seen both good and evil, hastens back\nagain as he came, to the place from which he started, to the state of sleeping\n(dream).\n\n18\\. \'In fact, as a large fish moves along the two banks of a river, the right\nand the left, so does that person move along these two states, the state of\nsleeping and the state of waking.\n\n19\\. \'And as a falcon, or any other (swift) bird, after he has roamed about\nhere in the air, becomes tired, and folding his wings is carried to his nest,\nso does that person hasten to that state where, when asleep, he desires no\nmore desires, and dreams no more dreams.\n\n20\\. \'There are in his body the veins called Hita, which are as small as a\nhair divided a thousandfold, full of white, blue, yellow, green, and red 1.\nNow\n\np. 168\n\nwhen, as it were, they kill him, when, as it were they overcome him, when, as\nit were, an elephant chases him, when, as it were, he falls into a well, he\nfancies, through ignorance, that danger which he (commonly) sees in waking.\nBut when he fancies that he is, as it were, a god, or that he is, as it were,\na king 1, or "I am this altogether," that is his highest world 2.\n\n21\\. \'This indeed is his (true) form, free from desires, free from evil, free\nfrom fear 3. Now as a man, when embraced by a beloved wife, knows nothing that\nis without, nothing that is within, thus this person, when embraced by the\nintelligent (pra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a) Self, knows nothing that is without, nothing that\nis within. This indeed is his (true) form, in which his wishes are fulfilled,\nin which the Self (only) is\n\np. 169\n\nhis wish, in which no wish is left,--free from any sorrow 1.\n\n22\\. \'Then a father is not a father, a mother not a mother, the worlds not\nworlds, the gods not gods, the Vedas not Vedas. Then a thief is not a thief, a\nmurderer not a murderer 2, a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala 3 not a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala, a\nPaulkasa 4 not a Paulkasa, a _S_ rama _n_ a 5 not a _S_ rama _n_ a, a Tapasa 6\nnot a Tapasa. He is not followed by good, not followed by evil, for he has\nthen overcome all the sorrows of the heart 7.\n\n23\\. \'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not see, yet\nhe is seeing, though he does not see 8. For sight is inseparable from the\n\np. 170\n\nseer, because it cannot perish. But there is then no second, nothing else\ndifferent from him that he could see.\n\n24\\. \'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not smell,\nyet he is smelling, though he does not smell. For smelling is inseparable from\nthe smeller, because it cannot perish. But there is then no second, nothing\nelse different from him that he could smell.\n\n25\\. \'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not taste,\nyet he is tasting, though he does not taste. For tasting is inseparable from\nthe taster, because it cannot perish. But there is then no second, nothing\nelse different from him that he could taste.\n\n26\\. \'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not speak,\nyet he is speaking, though he does not speak. For speaking is inseparable from\nthe speaker, because it cannot perish. But there is then no second, nothing\nelse different from him that he could speak.\n\n27\\. \'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not hear, yet\nhe is hearing, though he does not hear. For hearing is inseparable from the\nhearer, because it cannot perish. But. there is then no second, nothing else\ndifferent from him that he could hear.\n\n28\\. \'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not think,\nyet he is thinking, though he does not think. For thinking is inseparable from\nthe thinker, because it cannot perish.\n\np. 171\n\n[paragraph continues] But there is then no second, nothing else different from\nhim that he could think.\n\n29\\. \'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not touch,\nyet he is touching, though he does not touch. For touching is inseparable from\nthe toucher, because it cannot perish. But there is then no second, nothing\nelse different from him that he could think.\n\n30\\. \'And when (it is said that) there (in the Sushupti) he does not know, yet\nhe is knowing, though he does not know. For knowing is inseparable from the\nknower, because it cannot perish. But there is then no second, nothing else\ndifferent from him that he could know.\n\n31\\. \'When (in waking and dreaming) there is, as it were, another, then can\none see the other, then can one smell the other, then can one speak to the\nother, then can one hear the other, then can one think the other, then can one\ntouch the other, then can one know the other.\n\n32\\. \'An ocean 1 is that one seer, without any duality; this is the Brahma-\nworld 2, O King.\' Thus did Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya teach him. This is his highest\ngoal, this is his highest Success, this is his highest world, this is his\nhighest bliss. All other creatures live on a small portion of that bliss.\n\n33\\. \'If a man is healthy, wealthy, and lord of others, surrounded by all\nhuman enjoyments, that\n\np. 172\n\nis the highest blessing of men. Now a hundred of these human blessings make\none blessing of the fathers who have conquered the world (of the fathers). A\nhundred blessings of the fathers who have conquered this world make one\nblessing in the Gandharva world. A hundred blessings in the Gandharva world\nmake one blessing of the Devas by merit (work, sacrifice), who obtain their\ngodhead by merit. A hundred blessings of the Devas by merit make one blessing\nof the Devas by birth, also (of) a _S_ rotriya 1 who is without sin, and not\novercome by desire. A hundred blessings of the Devas by birth make one\nblessing in the world of Pra _g_ apati, also (of) a _S_ rotriya who is without\nsin, and not overcome. by desire. A hundred blessings in the world of Pra _g_\napati make one blessing in the world of Brahman, also (of) a _S_ rotriya who\nis without sin, and not overcome by desire. And this is the highest blessing\n2.\n\n\'This is the Brahma-world, O king,\' thus spake Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\n\n_G_ anaka Vaideha said: \'I give you, Sir, a thousand. Speak on for the sake of\n(my) emancipation.\'\n\nThen Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya was afraid lest the King, having become full of\nunderstanding, should drive him from all his positions 3.\n\n34\\. And Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: \'That (person), having enjoyed himself in\nthat state of sleeping (dream),\n\np. 173\n\nhaving moved about and seen both good and bad, hastens back again as he came,\nto the place from which he started, to the state of waking\n[1](sbe15076.htm#fn_505).\n\n35\\. \'Now as a heavy-laden carriage moves along groaning, thus does this\ncorporeal Self, mounted by the intelligent Self, move along groaning, when a\nman is thus going to expire [2](sbe15076.htm#fn_506).\n\n36\\. \'And when (the body) grows weak through old age, or becomes weak through\nillness, at that time that person, after separating himself from his members,\nas an Amra (mango), or Udumbara (fig), or Pippala-fruit is separated from the\nstalk, hastens back again as be came, to the place from which he started, to\n(new) life.\n\n37\\. \'And as policemen, magistrates, equerries, and governors wait for a king\nwho is coming back, with food and drink, saying, "He comes back, he\napproaches," thus do all the elements wait on him who knows this, saying,\n"That Brahman comes, that Brahman approaches."\n\n38\\. \'And as policemen, magistrates, equerries, and governors gather round a\nking who is departing, thus do all the senses (pra _n_ as) gather round the\nSelf at the time of death, when a man is thus going to expire.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[161:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_476) The introduction to this Brahma _n_ a has a very\npeculiar interest, as showing the close coherence of the different portions\nwhich together form the historical groundwork of the Upanishads. _G_ anaka\nVaideha and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya are leading characters in the B _ri_\nhadaranyaka-upanishad, and whenever they meet they seem to converse quite\nfreely, though each retains his own character, and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya honours\n_G_ anaka as king quite as much as _G_ anaka honours Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya as a\nBrahma _n_ a. Now in our chapter we read that Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya did not wish\nto enter on a discussion, but that _G_ anaka was the first to address him\n(purvam papra _k_ _kh_ a). This was evidently considered not quite correct,\nand an explanation is given, that _G_ anaka took this liberty because on a\nformer occasion Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya had granted him permission to address\nquestions to him, whenever he liked. It might be objected that such an\nexplanation looks very much like an after-thought, and we find indeed that in\nIndia itself some of the later commentators tried to avoid the difficulty by\ndividing the words sa mene na vadishya iti, into sam enena vadishya iti, so\nthat we should have to translate, \'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya came to _G_ anaka\nintending to speak with him.\' (See Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga\'s Comm. p. 1141.) This is, no\ndoubt, a very ingenious conjecture, which might well rouse the envy of\nEuropean scholars. But it is no more. The accents decide nothing, because they\nare changed by different writers, according to their different views of what\nthe Pada text ought to be. What made me prefer the reading which is supported\nby _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara and Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga, though the latter alludes to the other pada\n_k_ _kh_ eda, is that the tmesis, sam enena vadishye, does not occur again,\nwhile sa mene is a common phrase. But the most interesting point, as I\nremarked before, is that this former disputation between _G_ anaka and Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya and the permission granted to the King to ask any question he\nliked, is not a mere invention to account for the apparent rudeness by which\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya is forced to enter on a discussion against his will, but\nactually occurs in a former chapter. In _S_ atap. Br. XI, 6, 2, 10, we read:\ntasmai ha Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkyo vara _m_ dadau; sa hova _k_ a, kamapra _s_ _n_ a\np. 162 eva me tvayi Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkyasad iti, tato brahma _G_ anaka asa. This\nwould show that _G_ anaka was considered almost like a Brahma _n_ a, or at all\nevents enjoyed certain privileges which were supposed to belong to the first\ncaste only. See, for a different view, Deussen, Vedanta, p. 203; Regnaud\n(Materiaux pour servir a l\'histoire de la philosophie de l\'Inde), Errata; and\nSacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. lxxiii.\n\n[162:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_477) Read ki _m_ _g_ yotir as a Bahuvrihi. Purusha is\ndifficult to translate. It means man, but also the true essence of man, the\nsoul, as we should say, or something more abstract still, the person, as I\ngenerally translate it, though a person beyond the Ego.\n\n[163:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_478) Samipyalaksha _n_ a saptami, Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga. See B\n_ri_ h. Up. IV, 4, 22.\n\n[163:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_479) In this world, while awake or dreaming; in the\nother world, while in deep sleep.\n\n[163:3](sbe15075.htm#fr_480) The world thinks that he thinks, but in reality\nhe does not, he only witnesses the acts of buddhi, or thought.\n\n[164:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_481) There are really two sthanas or states only; the\nplace where they meet, like the place where two villages meet, belongs to\nboth, but it may be distinguished as a third. Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga (p. 1141) uses a\ncurious argument in support of the existence of another world. In early\nchildhood, he says, our dreams consist of the impressions of a former world,\nlater on they are filled with the impressions of our senses, and in old age\nthey contain visions of a world to come.\n\n[164:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_482) By works, by knowledge, and by remembrance of\nformer things; see B _ri_ h. Up. IV, 4, 2.\n\n[164:3](sbe15075.htm#fr_483) Dividing and separating the material, i.e. the\nimpressions received from this world. The commentator explains matra as a\nportion of the impressions which are taken away into sleep. \'Destroying\' he\nrefers to the body, which in sleep becomes senseless, and \'building up\' to the\nimaginations of dreams.\n\n[165:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_484) The Madhyandinas read paurusha, as an adjective\nto ekaha _m_ sa, but Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga explains paurusha as a synonym of purusha,\nwhich is the reading of the Ka _n_ vas.\n\n[165:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_485) Cf. Su _s_ ruta III, 7, 1.\n\n[165:3](sbe15075.htm#fr_486) I have translated this according to the\ncommentator, who says: \'Therefore the Self is self-illuminated during sleep.\nBut others say the state of waking is indeed the same for him as sleep; there\nis no other intermediate place, different from this and from the other\nworld.... And if sleep is the same as the state of waking, then is this Self\nnot separate, not cause and effect, but mixed with them, and the Self\ntherefore not self-illuminated. What he means p. 166 is that others, in order\nto disprove the self-illumination, say that this sleep is the same as the\nstate of waking, giving as their reason that we see in sleep or in dreams\nexactly what we see in waking. But this is wrong, because the senses have\nstopped, and only when the senses have stopped does one see dreams. Therefore\nthere is no necessity for admitting another light in sleep, but only the light\ninherent in the Self. This has been proved by all that went before.\' Dr. Roer\ntakes the same view in his translation, but Deussen (Vedanta, p. 205) takes an\nindependent view, and translates: I Therefore it is said: It (sleep) is to him\na place of waking only, for what he sees waking, the same he sees in sleep.\nThus this spirit serves there for his own light.\' Though the interpretations\nof _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara and Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga sound artificial, still Dr. Deussen\'s version\ndoes not remove all difficulties. If the purusha saw in sleep no more than\nwhat he had seen before in waking, then the whole argument in favour of the\nindependent action, or the independent light of the purusha, would go; anyhow\nit would be no argument on Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\'s side. See also note to\nparagraph 9, before.\n\n[166:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_487) The Madhyandinas speak only of his return from\nsvapnanta to buddhanta, from sleep to waking, instead of his going from\nsainprasada (deep sleep) to svapna (dream), from svapna to buddhanta, and from\nbuddhanta again to svapnanta, as the Ka _n_ vas have it. In \xc2\xa7 18 the Ka _n_\nvas also mention svapnanta and buddhanta only, but the next paragraph refers\nto sushupti.\n\n[167:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_488) Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga explains that if phlegm\npredominates, qualified by wind and bile, the juice in the veins is white; if\nwind predominates, qualified by phlegm and bile, it is blue; if bile\npredominates, qualified by wind and phlegm, it is yellow; if wind and phlegm\np. 168 predominate, with little bile only, it is green; and if the three\nelements are equal, it is red. See also \xc3\x82nandagiri\'s gloss, where Su _s_ ruta\nis quoted. Why this should be inserted here, is not quite clear, except that\nin sleep the purusha is supposed to, move about in the veins.\n\n[168:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_489) Here, again, the commentator seems to be right,\nbut his interpretation does violence to the context. The dangers which a man\nsees in his sleep are represented as mere imaginations, so is his idea of\nbeing of god or a king, while the idea that he is all this (aham eveda _m_\nsarva _h_ , i.e. ida _m_ sarvam, see _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, p. 873, l. 11) is represented\nas the highest and real state. But it is impossible to begin a new sentence\nwith aham evedam sarvam, and though it is true that all the preceding fancies\nare qualified by iva, I prefer to take deva and ra _g_ an as steps leading to\nthe sarvatmatva.\n\n[168:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_490) The Madhyandinas repeat here the sentence from\nyatra supto to pa _s_ yati, from the end of \xc2\xa7 19.\n\n[168:3](sbe15075.htm#fr_491) The Ka _n_ va text reads ati _k_ _kh_ anda\napahatapapma. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains ati _k_ _kh_ anda by ati _k_ _kh_ andam, and\nexcuses it as svadhyayadharma _h_ pa _th_ a _h_. The Madhyandinas read ati _k_\n_kh_ ando, but place the whole sentence where the Ka _n_ vas put aptakamam\n&c., at the end of \xc2\xa7 21.\n\n[169:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_492) The Ka _n_ vas read _s_ okantaram, the\nMadhyandinas a _s_ okantaram, but the commentators arrive at the same result,\nnamely, that it means _s_ oka _s_ unyam, free from grief _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara says: _s_\nokantara _m_ soka _k_ _kh_ idra _m_ _s_ oka _s_ unyam ityeta _k_ , _kh_\nokamadhyaman iti vi; sarvathapy a _s_ okam. Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga says: na vidyate _s_\noko \'ntare madhye yasya tad asokantara _m_ (ra, Weber) _s_ oka _s_ unyam.\n\n[169:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_493) Bhru _n_ ahan, varish _th_ abrabmahanta.\n\n[169:3](sbe15075.htm#fr_494) The son of a _S_ udra father and a Brahma _n_ a\nmother.\n\n[169:4](sbe15075.htm#fr_495) The son of a _S_ udra father and a Kshatriya\nmother.\n\n[169:5](sbe15075.htm#fr_496) A mendicant.\n\n[169:6](sbe15075.htm#fr_497) A Vanaprastha, who performs penances.\n\n[169:7](sbe15075.htm#fr_498) I have translated as if the text were ananvagata\n_h_ pu _n_ yena ananvagata _h_ papena. We find anvagata used in a similar way\nin \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 15, 16, &c. But the Ka _n_ vas read ananvagata _m_ pu _n_ yena\nananvagatam papena, and _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains the neuter by referring it to\nrupam (rupaparatvan napu _m_ sakali\xe1\xb9\x85gam). The Madhyandinas, if we may trust\nWeber\'s edition, read ananvagata _h_ pu _n_ yenanvagata _h_ papena. The second\nanvagata _h_ may be a mere misprint, but Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga seems to have read\nananvagatam, like the Ka _n_ vas, for he says: ananvagatam iti rupavishayo\nnapu _m_ sakanirde _s_ a _h_.\n\n[169:8](sbe15075.htm#fr_499) This is the old Upanishad argument that the true\nsense is the Self, and not the eye. Although therefore in the state of\nprofound sleep, where the eye and the other senses rest, it might be said that\nthe purusha does not see, yet he is a seer all the time, though he does not\nsee with the eye. The seer cannot lose his character p. 170 of seeing, as\nlittle as the fire can lose its character of burning, so long as it is fire.\nThe Self sees by its own light, like the sun, even where there is no second,\nno object but the Self, that could be seen.\n\n[171:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_500) Salila is explained as salilavat, like the ocean,\nthe seer being one like the ocean, which is one only. Dr. Deussen takes salila\nas a locative, and translates it \'In dem Gewoge,\' referring to _S_\nvetasvatara-upanishad VI, 15.\n\n[171:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_501) Or this seer is the Brahma-world, dwells in\nBrahman, or is Brahman.\n\n[172:1](sbe15075.htm#fr_502) An accomplished student of the Veda.\n\n[172:2](sbe15075.htm#fr_503) See Taitt. Up. II, 8, p. 59; _Kh_ and. Up. VIII,\n2, 1-10; Kaush. Up. I, 3-5; Regnaud, II, p. 33 seq.\n\n[172:3](sbe15075.htm#fr_504) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains that Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya was\nnot afraid that his own knowledge might prove imperfect, but that the king,\nhaving the right to ask him any question he liked, might get all his knowledge\nfrom him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4](sbe15076.htm)\n\n'
