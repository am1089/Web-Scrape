When the child is born, he lays an axe on a stone, and a piece of gold on\nthat axe; after he has turned these things upside down (so that the stone lies\nuppermost), he holds the boy over them with (the two verses),\n\n\'Be a stone, be an axe, be insuperable gold. Thou indeed art the Veda called\nson; so live a hundred autumns.\n\np. 211\n\n\'From limb by limb thou art produced; out of the heart thou art born. Thou\nindeed art the self (atman) called son; so live a hundred autumns.\'\n\n3\\. (The contents of this Sutra are similar to those of Paraskara I, 16, 2.)\n\n4\\. They take the Aupasana (or regular G _ri_ hya) fire away, and they bring\nthe Sutikagni (or the fire of the confinement).\n\n5\\. That (fire) is only used for warming (dishes, etc.).\n\n6\\. No ceremonies are performed with it except the fumigation (see the next\nSutra).\n\n7. 7 He fumigates (the child) with small grains mixed with mustard seeds. These he throws into the coals (of the Sutikagni) (eleven times, each time with one of the following Mantras):\n\n(a) \'May _S_ a _n_ _d_ a and Marka, Upavira, _S_ a _n_ _d_ ikera, Ulukhala,\n_K_ yavana vanish from here. Svaha!\n\n(b) \'\xc3\x82likhat, Vilikhat, Animisha, Ki _m_ vadanta, Upa _s_ ruti. Svaha!\n\n(c) \'Aryam _n_ a, Kumbhin, _S_ atru, Patrapa _n_ i, Nipu _n_ i.

Svaha!\n\n(f) \'The servants of Kuvera, Vi _s_ vavasa (?), sent by the king of demons,\nall of one common origin,\n\np. 212\n\nwalk through the villages, visiting those who wake (?). Svaha!\n\n(g) \'"Kill them! Bind them!" thus (says) this messenger of Brahman. Agni has\nencompassed them. Indra knows them; B _ri_ haspati knows them; I the Brahma\n_n_ a know them who seize (men), who have prominent teeth, rugged hair,\nhanging breasts. Svaha!\n\n(h) \'The night-walkers, wearing ornaments on their breasts, with lances in\ntheir hands, drinking out of skulls! Svaha!\n\n(i) \'Their father U _k_ _k_ ai _h_ _s_ ravyakar _n_ aka walks (?) at their\nhead, their mother walks in the rear, seeking a vikhura (?) in the village.\nSvaha!\n\n(k) \'The sister, the night-walker, looks at the family through the rift\n(?)\xc2\x97she who wakes while people sleep, whose mind is turned on the wife that\nhas become mother. Svaha!\n\n(l) \'O god with the black path, Agni, burn the lungs, the hearts, the livers\nof those (female demons); burn their eyes. Svaha!\'\n\n8. 8 Then he washes his hands and touches the ground with (the verses), \'O thou whose hair is well parted! Thy heart that dwells in heaven, in the moon: of that immortality impart to us. May I not weep over distress (falling to my lot) through my sons.\n\n\'I know thy heart, O earth, that dwells in heaven, in the moon: thus may I,\nthe lord of immortality, not weep over distress (falling to my lot) through my\nsons.\'\n\n9\\. Now (follows) the medha _g_ anana (or production\n\np. 213\n\nof intelligence). With (an instrument of) gold over which he has laid a Darbha\nshoot tied (to that piece of gold) he gives to the child, which is held so\nthat it faces the east, ghee to eat, with the formulas, \'Bhu _h_! I sacrifice\nthe _Ri_ _k_ as over thee! Bhuva _h_! I sacrifice the Ya _g_ us over thee!\nSuva _h_! I sacrifice the Samans over thee! Bhur bhuva _h_ suva _h_! I\nsacrifice the Atharvan and A\xe1\xb9\x85giras hymns over thee!\'\n\n10. 10 He then bathes the child with lukewarm water with (the following Mantras):\n\n\'From chronic disease, from destruction, from wile, from Varu _n_ a\'s fetter I\nrelease thee. I make thee guiltless before the Brahman; may both Heaven and\nEarth be kind towards thee.\n\n\'May Agni together with the waters bring thee bliss, Heaven and Earth together\nwith the herbs; may the air together with the wind bring thee bliss; may the\nfour quarters of the heaven bring thee bliss.\n\n\'Rightly have the gods released the sun from darkness and from the seizing\ndemon; they have dismissed him from guilt; thus I deliver this boy from\nchronic disease, from curse that comes from his kin, from wile, from Varu _n_\na\'s fetter.\'\n\n11\\. He then places the child in his mother\'s lap with (the verse):\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[211:7](sbe30075.htm#fr_649) 3, 7.
