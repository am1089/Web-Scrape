But that (i.e. the authoritativeness of Scripture with regard to Brahman)\nexists on account of the connexion (of Scripture with the highest aim of man).\n\nThe word 'but' is meant to rebut the objection raised. _That_ , i.e. the\nauthoritativeness of Scripture with regard to Brahman, is possible, on account\nof samanvaya, i.e. connexion with the highest aim of man--that is to say\nbecause the scriptural texts are connected with, i.e. have for their subject,\nBrahman, which constitutes the highest aim of man. For such is the connected\nmeaning of the whole aggregate of words which constitutes the\nUpanishads--'That from whence these beings are born'(Taitt. Up. III, 1, 1).\n'Being only this was in the beginning, one, without a second' ( _Kh_. Up. VI,\n2), &c. &c. And of aggregates of words which are capable of giving information\nabout accomplished things known through the ordinary means of ascertaining the\nmeaning of words, and which connectedly refer to a Brahman which is the cause\nof the origination, subsistence, and destruction of the entire world, is\nantagonistic to all imperfection and so on, we have no right to say that,\nowing to the absence of a purport in the form of activity or cessation of\nactivity, they really refer to something other than Brahman.\n\nFor all instruments of knowledge have their end in determining the knowledge\nof their own special objects: their action does not adapt itself to a final\npurpose, but the latter rather adapts itself to the means of knowledge. Nor is\nit true that where there is no connexion with activity or cessation of\nactivity all aim is absent; for in such cases we observe connexion with what\nconstitutes the general aim, i.e.\n\np. 175\n\nthe benefit of man. Statements of accomplished matter of fact--such as 'a son\nis born to thee.' 'This is no snake'--evidently have an aim, viz. in so far as\nthey either give rise to joy or remove pain and fear.\n\nAgainst this view the Purvapakshin now argues as follows. The Vedanta-texts do\nnot impart knowledge of Brahman; for unless related to activity or the\ncessation of activity, Scripture would be unmeaning, devoid of all purpose.\nPerception and the other means of knowledge indeed have their aim and end in\nsupplying knowledge of the nature of accomplished things and facts; Scripture,\non the other hand, must be supposed to aim at some practical purpose. For\nneither in ordinary speech nor in the Veda do we ever observe the employment\nof sentences devoid of a practical purpose: the employment of sentences not\nhaving such a purpose is in fact impossible. And what constitutes such purpose\nis the attainment of a desired, or the avoidance of a non-desired object, to\nbe effected by some action or abstention from action. 'Let a man desirous of\nwealth attach himself to the court of a prince'; 'a man with a weak digestion\nmust not drink much water'; 'let him who is desirous of the heavenly world\noffer sacrifices'; and so on. With regard to the assertion that such sentences\nalso as refer to accomplished things--'a son is born to thee' and so on--are\nconnected with certain aims of man, viz. joy or the cessation of fear, we ask\nwhether in such cases the attainment of man's purpose results from the thing\nor fact itself, as e.g. the birth of a son, or from the knowledge of that\nthing or fact.--You will reply that as a thing although actually existing is\nof no use to man as long as it is not known to him, man's purpose is\naccomplished by his knowledge of the thing.--It then appears, we rejoin, that\nman's purpose is effected through mere knowledge, even if there is no actual\nthing; and from this it follows that Scripture, although connected with\ncertain aims, is not a means of knowledge for the actual existence of things.\nIn all cases, therefore, sentences have a practical purpose; they determine\neither some form of activity or cessation from activity, or else some form of\nknowledge. No sentence,\n\np. 176\n\ntherefore, can have for its purport an accomplished thing, and hence the\nVedanta-texts do not convey the knowledge of Brahman as such an accomplished\nentity.\n\nAt this point somebody propounds the following view. The Vedanta-texts _are_\nan authoritative means for the cognition of Brahman, because as a matter of\nfact they also aim at something to be done. What they really mean to teach is\nthat Brahman, which in itself is pure homogeneous knowledge, without a second,\nnot connected with a world, but is, owing to beginningless Nescience, viewed\nas connected with a world, should be freed from this connexion. And it is\nthrough this process of dissolution of the world that Brahman becomes the\nobject of an injunction.--But which texts embody this injunction, according to\nwhich Brahman in its pure form is to be realised through the dissolution of\nthis apparent world with its distinction of knowing subjects and objects of\nknowledge?--Texts such as the following: 'One should not see (i. e. represent\nto oneself) the seer of seeing, one should not think the thinker of thinking'\n(B _ri_. Up. III, 4, 2); for this means that we should realise Brahman in the\nform of pure Seeing (knowledge), free from the distinction of seeing agents\nand objects of sight. Brahman is indeed accomplished through itself, but all\nthe same it may constitute an object to be accomplished, viz. in so far as it\nis being disengaged from the apparent world.\n\nThis view (the Mima _m_ saka rejoins) is unfounded. He who maintains that\ninjunction constitutes the meaning of sentences must be able to assign the\ninjunction itself, the qualification of the person to whom the injunction is\naddressed, the object of the injunction, the means to carry it out, the\nspecial mode of the procedure, and the person carrying out the injunction.\nAmong these things the qualification of the person to whom the injunction\naddresses itself is something not to be enjoined (but existing previously to\nthe injunction), and is of the nature either of cause (nimitta) or a result\naimed at (phala). We then have to decide what, in the case under discussion\n(i.e. the alleged injunction set forth by the antagonist), constitutes the\nqualification of the person to whom the injunction addresses\n\np. 177\n\nitself, and whether it be of the nature of a cause or of a result.--Let it\nthen be said that what constitutes the qualification in our case is the\nintuition of the true nature of Brahman (on the part of the person to whom the\ninjunction is addressed).--This, we rejoin, cannot be a cause, as it is not\nsomething previously established; while in other cases the nimitta is\nsomething so established, as e.g. 'life' is in the case of a person to whom\nthe following injunction is addressed, 'As long as his life lasts he is to\nmake the Agnihotra-oblation.' And if, after all, it were admitted to be a\ncause, it would follow that, as the intuition of the true nature of Brahman is\nsomething permanent, the object of the injunction would have to be\naccomplished even subsequently to final release, in the same way as the\nAgnihotra has to be performed permanently as long as life lasts.--Nor again\ncan the intuition of Brahman's true nature be a result; for then, being the\nresult of an action enjoined, it would be something non-permanent, like the\nheavenly world.--What, in the next place, would be the 'object to be\naccomplished' of the injunction? You may not reply 'Brahman'; for as Brahman\nis something permanent it is not something that can be realised, and moreover\nit is not denoted by a verbal form (such as denote actions that can be\naccomplished, as e.g. yaga, sacrifice).--Let it then be said that what is to\nbe realised is Brahman, in so far as free from the world!--But, we rejoin,\neven if this be accepted as a thing to be realised, it is not the object\n(vishaya) of the injunction--that it cannot be for the second reason just\nstated--but its final result (phala). What moreover is, on this last\nassumption, the thing to be realised--Brahman, or the cessation of the\napparent world?--Not Brahman; for Brahman is something accomplished, and from\nyour assumption it would follow that it is not eternal.--Well then, the\ndissolution of the world!--Not so, we reply; for then it would not be Brahman\nthat is realised.--Let it then be said that the dissolution of the world only\nis the object of the injunction!--This, too, cannot be, we rejoin; that\ndissolution is the result (phala) and cannot therefore be the\n\np. 178\n\nobject of the injunction. For the dissolution of the world means final\nrelease; and that is the result aimed at. Moreover, if the dissolution of the\nworld is taken as the object of the injunction, that dissolution would follow\nfrom the injunction, and the injunction would be carried out by the\ndissolution of the world; and this would be a case of vicious mutual\ndependence.--We further ask--is the world, which is to be put an end to, false\nor real?--If it is false, it is put an end to by knowledge alone, and then the\ninjunction is needless. Should you reply to this that the injunction puts an\nend to the world in so far as it gives rise to knowledge, we reply that\nknowledge springs of itself from the texts which declare the highest truth:\nhence there is no need of additional injunctions. As knowledge of the meaning\nof those texts sublates the entire false world distinct from Brahman, the\ninjunction itself with all its adjuncts is seen to be something baseless.--If,\non the other hand, the world is true, we ask--is the injunction, which puts an\nend to the world, Brahman itself or something different from Brahman? If the\nformer, the world cannot exist at all: for what terminates it, viz. Brahman,\nis something eternal; and the injunction thus being eternal itself Cannot be\naccomplished by means of certain actions.--Let then the latter alternative be\naccepted!--But in that case, the niyoga being something which is accomplished\nby a set of performances the function of which it is to put an end to the\nentire world, the performing person himself perishes (with the rest of the\nworld), and the niyoga thus remains without a substrate. And if everything\napart from Brahman is put an end to by a performance the function of which it\nis to put an end to the world, there remains no result to be effected by the\nniyoga, consequently there is no release.\n\nFurther, the dissolution of the world cannot constitute the instrument (kara\n_n_ a) in the action enjoined, because no mode of procedure (itikartavyata)\ncan be assigned for the instrument of the niyoga. and unless assisted by a\nmode of procedure an instrument cannot operate,--But why is there no 'mode of\nprocedure'?--For the following reasons.\n\np. 179\n\n[paragraph continues] A mode of procedure is either of a positive or a\nnegative kind. If positive, it may be of two kinds, viz. either such as to\nbring about the instrument or to assist it. Now in our case there is no room\nfor either of these alternatives. Not for the former; for there exists in our\ncase nothing analogous to the stroke of the pestle (which has the manifest\neffect of separating the rice grains from the husks), whereby the visible\neffect of the dissolution of the whole world could be brought about. Nor,\nsecondly, is there the possibility of anything assisting the instrument,\nalready existing independently, to bring about its effect; for owing to the\nexistence of such an assisting factor the instrument itself, i.e. the\ncessation of the apparent world, cannot be established. Nor must you say that\nit is the cognition of the non-duality of Brahman that brings about the means\nfor the dissolution of the world; for, as we have already explained above,\nthis cognition directly brings about final Release, which is the same as the\ndissolution of the world, and thus there is nothing left to be effected by\nspecial means.--And if finally the mode of procedure is something purely\nnegative, it can, owing to this its nature, neither bring about nor in any way\nassist the instrumental cause. From all this it follows that there is no\npossibility of injunctions having for their object the realisation of Brahman,\nin so far as free from the world.\n\nHere another prima facie view of the question is set forth.--It must be\nadmitted that the Vedanta-texts are not means of authoritative knowledge,\nsince they refer to Brahman, which is an accomplished thing (not a thing 'to\nbe accomplished'); nevertheless Brahman itself is established, viz. by means\nof those passages which enjoin meditation (as something 'to be done'). This is\nthe purport of texts such as the following: 'The Self is to be seen, to be\nheard, to be reflected on, to be meditated upon' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 5); 'The\nSelf which is free from sin must be searched out' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7, 1);\n'Let a man meditate upon him as the Self' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 7); 'Let a man\nmeditate upon the Self as his world' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 15).--These\ninjunctions have meditation for their object, and\n\np. 180\n\nmeditation again is defined by its own object only, so that the injunctive\nword immediately suggests an object of meditation; and as such an object there\npresents itself, the 'Self' mentioned in the same sentence. Now there arises\nthe question, What are the characteristics of that Self? and in reply to it\nthere come in texts such as 'The True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman'; 'Being\nonly this was in the beginning, one without a second.' As these texts give the\nrequired special information, they stand in a supplementary relation to the\ninjunctions, and hence are means of right knowledge; and in this way the\npurport of the Vedanta-texts includes Brahman--as having a definite place in\nmeditation which is the object of injunction. Texts such as 'One only without\na second' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 1); 'That is the true, that is the Self ( _Kh_.\nUp. VI, 8, 7); 'There is here not any plurality' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 19),\nteach that there is one Reality only, viz. Brahman, and that everything else\nis false. And as Perception and the other means of proof, as well as that part\nof Scripture which refers to action and is based on the view of plurality,\nconvey the notion of plurality, and as there is contradiction between\nplurality and absolute Unity, we form the conclusion that the idea of\nplurality arises through beginningless avidya, while absolute Unity alone is\nreal. And thus it is through the injunction of meditation on Brahman--which\nhas for its result the intuition of Brahman--that man reaches final release,\ni.e. becomes one with Brahman, which consists of non-dual intelligence free of\nall the manifold distinctions that spring from Nescience. Nor is this becoming\none with Brahman to be accomplished by the mere cognition of the sense of\ncertain Vedanta-texts; for this is not observed--the fact rather being that\nthe view of plurality persists even after the cognition of the sense of those\ntexts--, and, moreover, if it were so, the injunction by Scripture of hearing,\nreflecting, &c., would be purposeless.\n\nTo this reasoning the following objection might be raised.--We observe that\nwhen a man is told that what he is afraid of is not a snake, but only a rope,\nhis fear comes to an end; and as bondage is as unreal as the snake imagined in\nthe\n\np. 181\n\nrope it also admits of being sublated by knowledge, and may therefore, apart\nfrom all injunction, be put an end to by the simple comprehension of the sense\nof certain texts. If final release were to be brought about by injunctions, it\nwould follow that it is not eternal--not any more than the heavenly world and\nthe like; while yet its eternity is admitted by every one. Acts of religious\nmerit, moreover (such as are prescribed by injunctions), can only be the\ncauses of certain results in so far as they give rise to a body capable of\nexperiencing those results, and thus necessarily produce the so-called sa _m_\nsara-state(which is opposed to final release, and) which consists in the\nconnexion of the soul with some sort of body, high or low. Release, therefore,\nis not something to be brought about by acts of religious merit. In agreement\nherewith Scripture says, 'For the soul as long as it is in the body, there is\nno release from pleasure and pain; when it is free from the body, then neither\npleasure nor pain touch it' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 1). This passage declares\nthat in the state of release, when the soul is freed from the body, it is not\ntouched by either pleasure or pain--the effects of acts of religious merit or\ndemerit; and from this it follows that the disembodied state is not to be\naccomplished by acts of religious merit. Nor may it be said that, as other\nspecial results are accomplished by special injunctions, so the disembodied\nstate is to be accomplished by the injunction of meditation; for that state is\nessentially something _not_ to be effected. Thus scriptural texts say, 'The\nwise man who knows the Self as bodiless among the bodies, as persisting among\nnon-persisting things, as great and all-pervading; he does not grieve' (Ka.\nUp. I, 2, 22); 'That person is without breath, without internal organ, pure,\nwithout contact' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 2).--Release which is a bodiless state is\neternal, and cannot therefore be accomplished through meritorious acts.\n\nIn agreement herewith Scripture says, 'That which thou seest apart from\nmerit(dharma) and non-merit, from what is done and not done, from what exists\nand what has to be accomplished--tell me that' (Ka. Up. I, 2, l4).--Consider\nwhat follows also. When we speak of something being\n\np. 182\n\naccomplished (effected-sadhya) we mean one of four things, viz. its being\noriginated (utpatti), or obtained (prapti), or modified (vik _ri_ ti), or in\nsome way or other (often purely ceremonial) made ready or fit (sa _m_ sk _ri_\nti). Now in neither of these four senses can final Release be said to be\naccomplished. It cannot be originated, for being Brahman itself it is eternal.\nIt cannot be attained: for Brahman, being the Self, is something eternally\nattained. It cannot be modified; for that would imply that like sour milk and\nsimilar things (which are capable of change) it is non-eternal. Nor finally\ncan it be made 'ready' or 'fit.' A thing is made ready or fit either by the\nremoval of some imperfection or by the addition of some perfection. Now\nBrahman cannot be freed from any imperfection, for it is eternally faultless;\nnor can a perfection be added to it, for it is absolutely perfect. Nor can it\nbe improved in the sense in which we speak of improving a mirror, viz. by\npolishing it; for as it is absolutely changeless it cannot become the object\nof any action, either of its own or of an outside agent. And, again, actions\naffecting the body, such as bathing, do not 'purify' the Self (as might\npossibly be maintained) but only the organ of Egoity (aha _m_ kart _ri_ )\nwhich is the product of avidya, and connected with the body; it is this same\naha _m_ kart _ri_ also that enjoys the fruits springing from any action upon\nthe body. Nor must it be said that the Self _is_ the aha _m_ kart _ri_ ; for\nthe Self rather is that which is conscious of the aha _m_ kart _ri_. This is\nthe teaching of the mantras: 'One of them eats the sweet fruit, the other\nlooks on without eating' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1); 'When he is in union with the\nbody, the senses, and the mind, then wise men call him the Enjoyer' (Ka. Up.\nI, 3,4); 'The one God, hidden in all beings, all-pervading, the Self within\nall beings, watching over all works, dwelling in all beings, the witness, the\nperceiver, the only one, free from qualities' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 11); 'He\nencircled all, bright, bodiless, scatheless, without muscles, pure, untouched\nby evil' (\xc3\x8e _s_ a. Up. 8).--All these texts distinguish from the aha _m_ kart\n_ri_ due to Nescience, the true Self, absolutely perfect and pure, free from\nall change. Release therefore\n\np. 183\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--which _is_ the Self--cannot be brought about in any\nway.--But, if this is so, what then is the use of the comprehension of the\ntexts?--It is of use, we reply, in so far as it puts an end to the obstacles\nin the way of Release. Thus scriptural texts declare: 'You indeed are our\nfather, you who carry us from our ignorance to the other shore' (Pra. Up. VI,\n8); 'I have heard from men like you that he who knows the Self overcomes\ngrief. I am in grief. Do, Sir, help me over this grief of mine' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVII, 1, 3); 'To him whose faults had thus been rubbed out Sanatkumara showed\nthe other bank of Darkness' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 26, 2). This shows that what is\neffected by the comprehension of the meaning of texts is merely the cessation\nof impediments in the way of Release. This cessation itself, although\nsomething effected, is of the nature of that kind of nonexistence which\nresults from the destruction of something existent, and as such does not pass\naway.--Texts such as 'He knows Brahman, he becomes Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2,\n9); 'Having known him he passes beyond death' ( _S_ vet. Up. III,8), declare\nthat Release follows immediately on the cognition of Brahman, and thus\nnegative the intervention of injunctions.--Nor can it be maintained that\nBrahman is related to action in so far as constituting the object of the\naction either of knowledge or of meditation; for scriptural texts deny its\nbeing an object in either of these senses. Compare 'Different is this from\nwhat is known, and from what is unknown' (Ke. Up. II, 4); 'By whom he knows\nall this, whereby should he know him?' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15); 'That do thou\nknow as Brahman, not that on which they meditate as being this' (Ke. Up. II,\n4). Nor does this view imply that the sacred texts have no object at all; for\nit is their object to put an end to the view of difference springing from\navidya. Scripture does not objectivise Brahman in any definite form, but\nrather teaches that its true nature is to be non-object, and thereby puts an\nend to the distinction, fictitiously suggested by Nescience, of knowing\nsubjects, acts of knowledge, and objects of knowledge. Compare the text 'You\nshould not see a seer of seeing, you should not think a thinker of\n\np. 184\n\nthought,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. III, 4, 2).--Nor, again, must it be said that, if\nknowledge alone puts an end to bondage, the injunctions of hearing and so on\nare purposeless; for their function is to cause the origination of the\ncomprehension of the texts, in so far as they divert from all other\nalternatives the student who is naturally inclined to yield to distractions.--\nNor, again, can it be maintained that a cessation of bondage through mere\nknowledge is never observed to take place; for as bondage is something false\n(unreal) it cannot possibly persist after the rise of knowledge. For the same\nreason it is a mistake to maintain that the cessation of bondage takes place\nonly after the death of the body. In order that the fear inspired by the\nimagined snake should come to an end, it is required only that the rope should\nbe recognised as what it is, not that a snake should be destroyed. If the body\nwere something real, its destruction would be necessary; but being apart from\nBrahman it is unreal. He whose bondage does not come to an end, in him true\nknowledge has not arisen; this we infer from the effect of such knowledge not\nbeing observed in him. Whether the body persist or not, he who has reached\ntrue knowledge is released from that very moment.--The general conclusion of\nall this is that, as Release is not something to be accomplished by\ninjunctions of meditation, Brahman is not proved to be something standing in a\nsupplementary relation to such injunctions; but is rather proved by (non-\ninjunctory) texts, such as 'Thou art that'; 'The True, knowledge, infinite is\nBrahman'; 'This Self is Brahman.'\n\nThis view (the holder of the dhyana-vidhi theory rejoins) is untenable; since\nthe cessation of bondage cannot possibly spring from the mere comprehension of\nthe meaning of texts. Even if bondage were something unreal, and therefore\ncapable of sublation by knowledge, yet being something direct, immediate, it\ncould not be sublated by the indirect comprehension of the sense of texts.\nWhen a man directly conscious of a snake before him is told by a competent by-\nstander that it is not a snake but merely a rope, his fear is not dispelled by\na mere cognition contrary to\n\np. 185\n\nthat of a snake, and due to the information received; but the information\nbrings about the cessation of his fear in that way that it rouses him to an\nactivity aiming at the direct perception, by means of his senses, of what the\nthing before him really is. Having at first started back in fear of the\nimagined snake, he now proceeds to ascertain by means of ocular perception the\ntrue nature of the thing, and having accomplished this is freed from fear. It\nwould not be correct to say that in this case words (viz. of the person\ninforming) produce this perceptional knowledge; for words are not a sense-\norgan, and among the means of knowledge it is the sense-organs only that give\nrise to direct knowledge. Nor, again, can it be pleaded that in the special\ncase of Vedic texts sentences may give rise to direct knowledge, owing to the\nfact that the person concerned has cleansed himself of all imperfection\nthrough the performance of actions not aiming at immediate results, and has\nbeen withdrawn from all outward objects by hearing, reflection, and\nmeditation; for in other cases also, where special impediments in the way of\nknowledge are being removed, we never observe that the special means of\nknowledge, such as the sense-organs and so on, operate outside their proper\nlimited sphere.--Nor, again, can it be maintained that meditation acts as a\nmeans helpful towards the comprehension of texts; for this leads to vicious\nreciprocal dependence--when the meaning of the texts has been comprehended it\nbecomes the object of meditation; and when meditation has taken place there\narises comprehension of the meaning of the texts!--Nor can it be said that\nmeditation and the comprehension of the meaning of texts have different\nobjects; for if this were so the comprehension of the texts could not be a\nmeans helpful towards meditation: meditation on one thing does not give rise\nto eagerness with regard to another thing!--For meditation which consists in\nuninterrupted remembrance of a thing cognised, the cognition of the sense of\ntexts, moreover, forms an indispensable prerequisite; for knowledge of Brahman\n--the object of meditation--cannot originate from any other source.--Nor can\nit be said that\n\np. 186\n\nthat knowledge on which meditation is based is produced by one set of texts,\nwhile that knowledge which puts an end to the world is produced by such texts\nas 'thou art that,' and the like. For, we ask, has the former knowledge the\nsame object as the latter, or a different one? On the former alternative we\nare led to the same vicious reciprocal dependence which we noted above; and on\nthe latter alternative it cannot be shown that meditation gives rise to\neagerness with regard to the latter kind of knowledge. Moreover, as meditation\npresupposes plurality comprising an object of meditation, a meditating subject\nand so on, it really cannot in any perceptible way be helpful towards the\norigination of the comprehension of the sense of texts, the object of which is\nthe oneness of a Brahman free from all plurality: he, therefore, who maintains\nthat Nescience comes to an end through the mere comprehension of the meaning\nof texts really implies that the injunctions of hearing, reflection, and\nmeditation are purposeless.\n\nThe conclusion that, since direct knowledge cannot spring from texts,\nNescience is not terminated by the comprehension of the meaning of texts,\ndisposes at the same time of the hypothesis of the so-called 'Release in this\nlife' ( _g_ ivanmukti). For what definition, we ask, can be given of this\n'Release in this life'?--'Release of a soul while yet joined to a body'!--You\nmight as well say, we reply, that your mother never had any children! You have\nyourself proved by scriptural passages that 'bondage' means the being joined\nto a body, and 'release' being free from a body!--Let us then define _g_\nivanmukti as the cessation of embodiedness, in that sense that a person, while\nthe appearance of embodiedness persists, is conscious of the unreality of that\nappearance.--But, we rejoin, if the consciousness of the unreality of the body\nputs an end to embodiedness, how can you say that _g_ ivanmukti means release\nof a soul while joined to a body? On this explanation there remains no\ndifference whatsoever between 'Release in this life' and Release after death;\nfor the latter also can only be defined as cessation of the false appearance\nof embodiedness.--Let us then say that a person is ' _g_ ivanmukta' when the\nappearance\n\np. 187\n\nof embodiedness, although sublated by true knowledge, yet persists in the same\nway as the appearance of the moon being double persists (even after it has\nbeen recognised as false).--This too we cannot allow. As the sublating act of\ncognition on which Release depends extends to everything with the exception of\nBrahman, it sublates the general defect due to causal Nescience, inclusive of\nthe particular erroneous appearance of embodiedness: the latter being sublated\nin this way cannot persist. In the case of the double moon, on the other hand,\nthe defect of vision on which the erroneous appearance depends is _not_ the\nobject of the sublative art of cognition, i.e. the cognition of the oneness of\nthe moon, and it therefore remains non-sublated; hence the false appearance of\na double moon may persist.--Moreover, the text 'For him there is delay only as\nlong as he is not freed from the body; then he will be released' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVI, 14, 2), teaches that he who takes his stand on the knowledge of the Real\nrequires for his Release the putting off of the body only: the text thus\nnegatives _g_ ivanmukti. \xc3\x82pastamba also rejects the view of _g_ ivanmukti,\n'Abandoning the Vedas, this world and the next, he (the Sa _m_ nyasin) is to\nseek the Self. (Some say that) he obtains salvation when he knows (the Self).\nThis opinion is contradicted by the _s_ astras. (For) if Salvation were\nobtained when the Self is known, he should not feel any pain even in this\nworld. Hereby that which follows is explained' (Dh. Su. II, 9, 13-17).--This\nrefutes also the view that Release is obtained through mere knowledge.--The\nconclusion to be drawn from all this is that Release, which consists in the\ncessation of all Plurality, cannot take place as long as a man lives. And we\ntherefore adhere to our view that Bondage is to be terminated only by means of\nthe injunctions of meditation, the result of which is direct knowledge of\nBrahman. Nor must this be objected to on the ground that Release, if brought\nabout by injunctions, must therefore be something non-eternal; for what is\neffected is not Release itself, but only the cessation of what impedes it.\nMoreover, the injunction does not directly produce the cessation of\n\np. 188\n\n[paragraph continues] Bondage, but only through the mediation of the direct\ncognition of Brahman as consisting of pure knowledge, and not connected with a\nworld. It is this knowledge only which the injunction produces.--But how can\nan injunction cause the origination of knowledge?--How, we ask in return, can,\non your view, works not aiming at some immediate result cause the origination\nof knowledge?--You will perhaps reply 'by means of purifying the mind'\n(manas); but this reply may be given by me also.--But (the objector resumes)\nthere is a difference. On my view Scripture produces knowledge in the mind\npurified by works; while on your view we must assume that in the purified mind\nthe means of knowledge are produced by injunction.--The mind itself, we reply,\npurified by knowledge, constitutes this means.--How do you know this? our\nopponent questions.--How, we ask in return, do you know that the mind is\npurified by works, and that, in the mind so purified of a person withdrawn\nfrom all other objects by hearing, reflection and meditation, Scripture\nproduces that knowledge which destroys bondage?--Through certain texts such as\nthe following: 'They seek to know him by sacrifice, by gifts, by penance, by\nfasting' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22); 'He is to be heard, to be reflected on, to\nbe meditated on' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 5); 'He knows Brahman, he becomes\nBrahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9).--Well, we reply, in the same way our view--viz.\nthat through the injunction of meditation the mind is cleared, and that a\nclear mind gives rise to direct knowledge of Brahman--is confirmed by\nscriptural texts such as 'He is to be heard, to be reflected on, to be\nmeditated on' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 5); 'He who knows Brahman reaches the\nhighest' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); 'He is not apprehended by the eye nor by\nspeech' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 8); 'But by a pure mind' (?); 'He is apprehended by\nthe heart, by wisdom, by the mind' (Ka. Up. II, 6, 9). Nor can it be said that\nthe text 'not that which they meditate upon as this' (Ke. Up. I, 4) negatives\nmeditation; it does not forbid meditation on Brahman, but merely declares that\nBrahman is different from the world. The mantra is to be explained as follows:\n'What men meditate upon as\n\np. 189\n\nthis world, that is not Brahman; know Brahman to be that which is not uttered\nby speech, but through which speech is uttered.' On a different explanation\nthe clause 'know that to be Brahman' would be irrational, and the injunctions\nof meditation on the Self would--be meaningless.--The outcome of all this is\nthat unreal Bondage which appears in the form of a plurality of knowing\nsubjects, objects of knowledge, &c., is put an end to by the injunctions of\nmeditation, the fruit of which is direct intuitive knowledge of Brahman.\n\nNor can we approve of the doctrine held by some that there is no contradiction\nbetween difference and non-difference; for difference and non-difference\ncannot co-exist in one thing, any more than coldness and heat, or light and\ndarkness.--Let us first hear in detail what the holder of this so-called\nbhedabheda view has to say. The whole universe of things must be ordered in\nagreement with our cognitions. Now we are conscious of all things as different\nand non-different at the same time: they are non-different in their causal and\ngeneric aspects, and different in so far as viewed as effects and individuals.\nThere indeed is a contradiction between light and darkness and so on; for\nthese cannot possibly exist together, and they are actually met with in\ndifferent abodes. Such contradictoriness is not. on the other hand, observed\nin the case of cause and effect, and genus and individual; on the contrary we\nhere distinctly apprehend one thing as having two aspects--'this jar is clay',\n'this cow is short-horned.' The fact is that experience does not show us\nanything that has one aspect only. Nor can it be said that in these cases\nthere is absence of contradiction because as fire consumes grass so non-\ndifference absorbs difference; for the same thing which exists as clay, or\ngold, or cow, or horse, &c., at the same time exists as jar or diadem, or\nshort-horned cow or mare. There is no command of the Lord to the effect that\none aspect only should belong to each thing, non-difference to what is non-\ndifferent, and difference to what is different.--But one aspect only belongs\nto each thing, because it is thus that things are perceived!--On\n\np. 190\n\nthe contrary, we reply, things have twofold aspects, just because it is _thus_\nthat they are perceived. No man, however wide he may open his eyes, is able to\ndistinguish in an object--e.g. a jar or a cow--placed before him which part is\nthe clay and which the jar, or which part is the generic character of the cow\nand which the individual cow. On the contrary, his thought finds its true\nexpression in the following judgments: 'this jar is clay'; 'this cow is short-\nhorned.' Nor can it be maintained that he makes a distinction between the\ncause and genus as objects of the idea of persistence, and the effect and\nindividual as objects of the idea of discontinuance (difference); for as a\nmatter of fact there is no perception of these two elements in separation. A\nman may look ever so close at a thing placed before him, he--will not be able\nto perceive a difference of aspect and to point out 'this is the persisting,\ngeneral, element in the thing, and that the non-persistent, individual,\nelement.' Just as an effect and an individual give rise to the idea of one\nthing, so the effect plus cause, and the individual _plus_ generic character,\nalso give rise to the idea of one thing only. This very circumstance makes it\npossible for us to recognise each individual thing, placed as it is among a\nmultitude of things differing in place, time, and character.--Each thing thus\nbeing cognised as endowed with a twofold aspect, the theory of cause and\neffect, and generic character and individual, being absolutely different, is\nclearly refuted by perception.\n\nBut, an objection is raised, if on account of grammatical co-ordination and\nthe resulting idea of oneness, the judgment 'this pot is clay' is taken to\nexpress the relation of difference, _plus_ non-difference, we shall have\nanalogously to infer from judgments such as 'I am a man', 'I am a divine\nbeing' that the Self and the body also stand in the bhedabheda-relation; the\ntheory of the co-existence of difference and non-difference will thus act like\na fire which a man has lit on his hearth, and which in the end consumes the\nentire house!--This, we reply, is the baseless idea of a person who has not\nduly considered the true nature of co-ordination as establishing the\nbhedabheda-relation. The\n\np. 191\n\ncorrect principle is that all reality is determined by states of consciousness\nnot sublated by valid means of proof. The imagination, however, of the\nidentity of the Self and the body is sublated by all the means of proof which\napply to the Self: it is in fact no more valid than the imagination of the\nsnake in the rope, and does not therefore prove the non-difference of the two.\nThe co-ordination, on the other hand, which is expressed in the judgment 'the\ncow is short-horned' is never observed to be refuted in any way, and hence\nestablishes the bhedabheda-relation.\n\nFor the same reasons the individual soul ( _g_ iva) is not absolutely\ndifferent from Brahman, but stands to it in the bhedabheda-relation in so far\nas it is a part (a _ms_ a) of Brahman. Its non-difference from Brahman is\nessential (svabhavika); its difference is due to limiting adjuncts\n(aupadhika). This we know, in the first place, from those scriptural texts\nwhich declare non-difference--such as 'Thou art that' ( _Kh_. Up. VI); 'There\nis no other seer but he' (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 23); 'This Self is Brahman' (B\n_ri_. Up. II, 5, 19); and the passage from the Brahmasukta in the Sa _m_\nhitopanishad of the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ as which, after having said that Brahman is\nHeaven and Earth, continues, 'The fishermen are Brahman, the slaves are\nBrahman, Brahman are these gamblers; man and woman are born from Brahman;\nwomen are Brahman and so are men.' And, in the second place, from those texts\nwhich declare difference: 'He who, one, eternal, intelligent, fulfils the\ndesires of many non-eternal intelligent beings' (Ka. Up. II, 5, 13); 'There\nare two unborn, one knowing, the other not-knowing; one strong, the other\nweak' ( _S_ vet. Up. I, 9); 'Being the cause of their connexion with him,\nthrough the qualities of action and the qualities of the Self, he is seen as\nanother' ( _S_ vet. Up. V, 12); 'The Lord of nature and the souls, the ruler\nof the qualities, the cause of the bondage, the existence and the release of\nthe sa _m_ sara' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 16); 'He is the cause, the lord of the\nlords of the organs' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 9); 'One of the two eats the sweet\nfruit, without eating the other looks on' ( _S_ vet. Up. IV, 6); 'He who\ndwelling in the Self (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 22);\n\np. 192\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Embraced by the intelligent Self he knows nothing that\nis without, nothing that is within' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 21); 'Mounted by the\nintelligent Self he goes groaning' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3,35); 'Having known him\nhe passes beyond death' ( _S_ vet. Up. III, 8).--On the ground of these two\nsets of passages the individual and the highest Self must needs be assumed to\nstand in the bhedabheda-relation. And texts such as 'He knows Brahman, he\nbecomes Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9), which teach that in the state of Release\nthe individual soul enters into Brahman itself; and again texts such as 'But\nwhen the Self has become all for him, whereby should he see another' (B _ri_.\nUp. II, 4, 13), which forbid us to view, in the state of Release, the Lord as\nsomething different (from the individual soul), show that non-difference is\nessential (while difference is merely aupadhika).\n\nBut, an objection is raised, the text 'He reaches all desires together in the\nwise Brahman,' in using the word 'together' shows that even in the state of\nRelease the soul is different from Brahman, and the same view is expressed in\ntwo of the Sutras, viz. IV, 4, 17; 21.--This is not so, we reply; for the\ntext, 'There is no other seer but he' (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 23), and many\nsimilar texts distinctly negative all plurality in the Self. The Taittiriya-\ntext quoted by you means that man reaches Brahman with all desires, i.e.\nBrahman comprising within itself all objects of desire; if it were understood\ndifferently, it would follow that Brahman holds a subordinate position only.\nAnd if the Sutra IV, 4, 17 meant that the released soul is separate from\nBrahman it would follow that it is deficient in lordly power; and if this were\nso the Sutra would be in conflict with other Sutras such as IV, 4, 1.--For\nthese reasons, non-difference is the essential condition; while the\ndistinction of the souls from Brahman and from each other is due to their\nlimiting adjuncts, i.e. the internal organ, the sense-organs, and the body.\nBrahman indeed is without parts and omnipresent; but through its adjuncts it\nbecomes capable of division just as ether is divided by jars and the like. Nor\nmust it be said that this leads to a reprehensible\n\np. 193\n\nmutual dependence--Brahman in so far as divided entering into conjunction with\nits adjuncts, and again the division in Brahman being caused by its\nconjunction with its adjuncts; for these adjuncts and Brahman's connexion with\nthem are due to action (karman), and the stream of action is without a\nbeginning. The limiting adjuncts to which a soul is joined spring from the\nsoul as connected with previous works, and work again springs from the soul as\njoined to its adjuncts: and as this connexion with works and adjuncts is\nwithout a beginning in time, no fault can be found with our theory.--The non-\ndifference of the souls from each other and Brahman is thus essential, while\ntheir difference is due to the Upadhis. These Upadhis, on the other hand, are\nat the same time essentially non-distinct and essentially distinct from each\nother and Brahman; for there are no other Upadhis (to account for their\ndistinction if non-essential), and if we admitted such, we should again have\nto assume further Upadhis, and so on _in infinitum_. We therefore hold that\nthe Upadhis are produced, in accordance with the actions of the individual\nsouls, as essentially non-different and different from Brahman.\n\nTo this bhedabheda view the Purvapakshin now objects on the following\ngrounds:--The whole aggregate of Vedanta-texts aims at enjoining meditation on\na non-dual Brahman whose essence is reality, intelligence, and bliss, and thus\nsets forth the view of non-difference; while on the other hand the karma-\nsection of the Veda, and likewise perception and the other means of knowledge,\nintimate the view of the difference of things. Now, as difference and non-\ndifference are contradictory, and as the view of difference may be accounted\nfor as resting on beginningless Nescience, we conclude that universal non-\ndifference is what is real.--The tenet that difference and non-difference are\nnot contradictory because both are proved by our consciousness, cannot be\nupheld. If one thing has different characteristics from another there is\ndistinction (bheda) of the two; the contrary condition of things constitutes\nnon-distinction (abheda); who in his senses then would maintain that these\ntwo-suchness and non-suchness--can\n\np. 194\n\nbe found together? You have maintained that non-difference belongs to a thing\nviewed as cause and genus, and difference to the same viewed as effect and\nindividual; and that, owing to this twofold aspect of things, non-difference\nand difference are not irreconcileable. But that this view also is untenable,\na presentation of the question in definite alternatives will show. Do you mean\nto say that the difference lies in one aspect of the thing and the non-\ndifference in the other? or that difference _and_ non-difference belong to the\nthing possessing two aspects?--On the former alternative the difference\nbelongs to the individual and the non-difference to the genus; and this\nimplies that there is no one thing with a double aspect. And should you say\nthat the genus and individual together constitute one thing only, you abandon\nthe view that it is difference of aspect which takes away the\ncontradictoriness of difference and non-difference. We have moreover remarked\nalready that difference in characteristics and its opposite are absolutely\ncontradictory.--On the second alternative we have two aspects of different\nkind and an unknown thing supposed to be the substrate of those aspects; but\nthis assumption of a triad of entities proves only their mutual difference of\ncharacter, not their non-difference. Should you say that the non-\ncontradictoriness of two aspects constitutes simultaneous difference and non-\ndifference in the thing which is their substrate, we ask in return--How can\ntwo aspects which have a thing for their substrate, and thus are different\nfrom the thing, introduce into that thing a combination of two contradictory\nattributes (viz. difference and non-difference)? And much less even are they\nable to do so if they are viewed as non-different from the thing which is\ntheir substrate. If, moreover, the two aspects on the one hand, and the thing\nin which they inhere on the other, be admitted to be distinct entities, there\nwill be required a further factor to bring about their difference and non-\ndifference, and we shall thus be led into a _regressus in infinitum._ \\--Nor\nis it a fact that the idea of a thing inclusive of its generic character bears\nthe character of unity, in the same way as\n\np. 195\n\nthe admittedly uniform idea of an individual; for wherever a state of\nconsciousness expresses itself in the form 'this is such and such' it implies\nthe distinction of an attribute or mode, and that to which the attribute or\nmode belongs. In the case under discussion the genus constitutes the mode, and\nthe individual that to which the mode belongs: the idea does not therefore\npossess the character of unity.\n\nFor these very reasons the individual soul cannot stand to Brahman in the\nbhedabheda-relation. And as the view of non-difference is founded on\nScripture, we assume that the view of difference rests on beginningless\nNescience.--But on this view want of knowledge and all the imperfections\nspringing therefrom, such as birth, death, &c., would cling to Brahman itself,\nand this would contradict scriptural texts such as 'He who is all-knowing'\n(Mu. Up. I, 1, 9); 'That Self free from all evil' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 5). Not\nso, we reply. For all those imperfections we consider to be unreal. On your\nview on the other hand, which admits nothing but Brahman and its limiting\nadjuncts, all the imperfections which spring from contact with those adjuncts\nmust really belong to Brahman. For as Brahman is without parts, indivisible,\nthe upadhis cannot divide or split it so as to connect themselves with a part\nonly; but necessarily connect themselves with Brahman itself and produce their\neffects on it.--Here the following explanation may possibly be attempted.\nBrahman determined by an upadhi constitutes the individual soul. This soul is\nof atomic size since what determines it, viz. the internal organ, is itself of\natomic size; and the limitation itself is without beginning. All the\nimperfections therefore connect themselves only with that special place that\nis determined by the upadhi, and do not affect the highest Brahman which is\nnot limited by the upadhi.--In reply to this we ask--Do you mean to say that\nwhat constitutes the atomic individual soul is a part of Brahman which is\nlimited and cut off by the limiting adjunct; or some particular part of\nBrahman which, without being thereby divided off, is connected with an atomic\nupadhi; or Brahman in its totality as connected with an upadhi; or some other\nintelligent\n\np. 196\n\nbeing connected with an upadhi, or finally the upadhi itself?--The first\nalternative is not possible, because Brahman cannot be divided; it would\nmoreover imply that the individual soul has a beginning, for division means\nthe making of one thing into two.--On the second alternative it would follow\nthat, as a part of Brahman would be connected with the upadhi, all the\nimperfections due to the upadhis would adhere to that part. And further, if\nthe upadhi would not possess the power of attracting to itself the particular\npart of Brahman with which it is connected, it would follow that when the\nupadhi moves the part with, which it is connected would constantly change; in\nother words, bondage and release would take place at every moment. If, on the\ncontrary, the upadhi possessed the power of attraction, the whole Brahman--as\nnot being capable of division--would be attracted and move with the upadhi.\nAnd should it be said that what is all-pervading and without parts cannot be\nattracted and move, well then the upadhi only moves, and we are again met by\nthe difficulties stated above. Moreover, if all the upadhis were connected\nwith the parts of Brahman viewed as one and undivided, all individual souls,\nbeing nothing but parts of Brahman, would be considered as non-distinct. And\nshould it be said that they are not thus cognised as one because they are\nconstituted by different parts of Brahman, it would follow that as soon as the\nupadhi of one individual soul is moving, the identity of that soul would be\nlost (for it would, in successive moments, be constituted by different parts\nof Brahman).--On the third alternative (the whole of) Brahman itself being\nconnected with the upadhi enters into the condition of individual soul, and\nthere remains no non-conditioned Brahman. And, moreover, the soul in all\nbodies will then be one only.--On the fourth alternative the individual soul\nis something altogether different from Brahman, and the difference of the soul\nfrom Brahman thus ceases to depend on the upadhis of Brahman.--And the fifth\nalternative means the embracing of the view of the _K_ arvaka (who makes no\ndistinction between soul and matter).--The conclusion from all this is that on\nthe\n\np. 197\n\nstrength of the texts declaring non-difference we must admit that all\ndifference is based on Nescience only. Hence, Scripture being an authoritative\ninstrument of knowledge in so far only as it has for its end action and the\ncessation of action, the Vedanta-texts must be allowed to be a valid means of\nknowledge with regard to Brahman's nature, in so far as they stand in a\nsupplementary relation to the injunctions of meditation.\n\nThis view is finally combated by the Mima _m_ saka. Even if, he says, we allow\nthe Vedanta-texts to have a purport in so far as they are supplementary to\ninjunctions of meditation, they cannot be viewed as valid means of knowledge\nwith regard to Brahman. Do the texts referring to Brahman, we ask, occupy the\nposition of valid means of knowledge in so far as they form a syntactic whole\nwith the injunctions of meditation, or as independent sentences? In the former\ncase the purport of the syntactic whole is simply to enjoin meditation, and it\ncannot therefore aim at giving instruction about Brahman. If, on the other\nhand, the texts about Brahman are separate independent sentences, they cannot\nhave the purport of prompting to action and are therefore devoid of\ninstructive power. Nor must it be said that meditation is a kind of continued\nremembrance, and as such requires to be defined by the object remembered; and\nthat the demand of the injunction of meditation for something to be remembered\nis satisfied by texts such as 'All this is that Self', 'the True, knowledge,\ninfinite is Brahman,' &c., which set forth the nature and attributes of\nBrahman and--forming a syntactic whole with the injunctions--are a valid means\nof knowledge with regard to the existence of the matter they convey. For the\nfact is that the demand on the part of an injunction of meditation for an\nobject to be remembered may be satisfied even by something unreal (not true),\nas in the case of injunctions such as 'Let him meditate upon mind as Brahman'\n( _Kh_. Up. III, 18, 1): the real existence of the object of meditation is\ntherefore not demanded.--The final conclusion arrived at in this purvapaksha\nis therefore as follows. As the Vedanta-texts do not aim at prompting to\naction or the cessation of action; as, even on the supposition\n\np. 198\n\nof their being supplementary to injunctions of meditation, the only thing they\neffect is to set forth the nature of the object of meditation; and as, even if\nthey are viewed as independent sentences, they accomplish the end of man (i.e.\nplease, gratify) by knowledge merely--being thus comparable to tales with\nwhich we soothe children or sick persons; it does not lie within their\nprovince to establish the reality of an accomplished thing, and hence\nScripture cannot be viewed as a valid means for the cognition of Brahman.\n\nTo this prima facie view the Sutrakara replies, 'But this on account of\nconnexion.' 'Connexion' is here to be taken in an eminent sense, as 'connexion\nwith the end of man.' That Brahman, which is measureless bliss and therefore\nconstitutes the highest end of man, is connected with the texts as the topic\nset forth by them, proves Scripture to be a valid means for the cognition of\nBrahman. To maintain that the whole body of Vedanta-texts-which teach us that\nBrahman is the highest object to be attained, since it consists of supreme\nbliss free of all blemish whatsoever--is devoid of all use and purpose merely\nbecause it does not aim at action or the cessation of action; is no better\nthan to say that a youth of royal descent is of no use because he does not\nbelong to a community of low wretches living on the flesh of dogs!\n\nThe relation of the different texts is as follows. There are individual souls\nof numberless kinds-gods, Asuras, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Vidyadharas, Kinnaras,\nKi _m_ purushas, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Pisa _k_ as, men, beasts, birds, creeping\nanimals, trees, bushes, creepers, grasses and so on--distinguished as male,\nfemale, or sexless, and having different sources of nourishment and support\nand different objects of enjoyment. Now all these souls are deficient in\ninsight into the true nature of the highest reality, their understandings\nbeing obscured by Nescience operating in the form of beginningless karman; and\nhence those texts only are fully useful to them which teach that there exists\na highest Brahman--which the souls in the state of release may cognise as non-\ndifferent from themselves, and which\n\np. 199\n\nthen, through its own essential nature, qualities, power and energies, imparts\nto those souls bliss infinite and unsurpassable. When now the question arises\n--as it must arise--, as to how this Brahman is to be attained, there step in\ncertain other Vedanta-texts--such as He who knows Brahman reaches the highest'\n(B _ri_. Up. II, 1, 1), and 'Let a man meditate on the Self as his world' (B\n_ri_. Up. 1, 4, 15)--and, by means of terms denoting 'knowing' and so on,\nenjoin meditation as the means of attaining Brahman. (We may illustrate this\nrelation existing between the texts setting forth the nature of Brahman and\nthose enjoining meditation by two comparisons.) The case is like that of a man\nwho has been told 'There is a treasure hidden in your house'. He learns\nthrough this sentence the existence of the treasure, is satisfied, and then\ntakes active steps to find it and make it his own.--Or take the case of a\nyoung prince who, intent on some boyish play, leaves his father's palace and,\nlosing his way, does not return. The king thinks his son is lost; the boy\nhimself is received by some good Brahman who brings him up and teaches him\nwithout knowing who the boy's father is. When the boy has reached his\nsixteenth year and is accomplished in every way, some fully trustworthy person\ntells him, 'Your father is the ruler of all these lands, famous for the\npossession of all noble qualities, wisdom, generosity, kindness, courage,\nvalour and so on, and he stays in his capital, longing to see you, his lost\nchild. Hearing that his father is alive and a man so high and noble, the boy's\nheart is filled with supreme joy; and the king also, understanding that his\nson is alive, in good health, handsome and well instructed, considers himself\nto have attained all a man can wish for. He then takes steps to recover his\nson, and finally the two are reunited.\n\nThe assertion again that a statement referring to some accomplished thing\ngratifies men merely by imparting a knowledge of the thing, without being a\nmeans of knowledge with regard to its real existence--so that it would be\ncomparable to the tales we tell to children and sick people--, can in no way\nbe upheld. When it is ascertained that a thing has no real existence, the mere\nknowledge or idea\n\np. 200\n\nof the thing does not gratify. The pleasure which stories give to children and\nsick people is due to the fact that they erroneously believe them to be true;\nif they were to find out that the matter present to their thought is untrue\ntheir pleasure would come to an end that very moment. And thus in the case of\nthe texts of the Upanishads also. If we thought that these texts do not mean\nto intimate the real existence of Brahman, the mere idea of Brahman to which\nthey give rise would not satisfy us in any way.\n\nThe conclusion therefore is that texts such as 'That from whence these beings\nare born' &c. do convey valid instruction as to the existence of Brahman, i.e.\nthat being which is the sole cause of the world, is free from all shadow of\nimperfection, comprises within itself all auspicious qualities, such as\nomniscience and so on, and is of the nature of supreme bliss.--Here terminates\nthe adhikara _n_ a of 'connexion'.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 5.
