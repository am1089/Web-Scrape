And if you say (that the soul may move the pradhana) as the (lame) man\n(moves the blind one) or as the magnet (moves the iron); thus also (the\ndifficulty is not overcome).\n\nWell then--the Sa _n_ khya resumes, endeavouring to defend his position by\nparallel instances--let us say that, as some lame man devoid of the power of\nmotion, but possessing the power of sight, having mounted the back of a blind\nman who is able to move but not to see, makes the latter move; or as the\nmagnet not moving itself, moves the iron, so the soul moves the pradhana.--\nThus also, we reply, you do not free your doctrine from all shortcomings; for\nthis your new position involves an abandonment of your old\n\np. 374\n\nposition, according to which the pradhana is moving of itself, and the\n(indifferent, inactive) soul possesses no moving power. And how should the\nindifferent soul move the pradhana? A man, although lame, may make a blind man\nmove by means of words and the like; but the soul which is devoid of action\nand qualities cannot possibly put forth any moving energy. Nor can it be said\nthat it moves the pradhana by its mere proximity as the magnet moves the iron;\nfor from the permanency of proximity (of soul and pradhana) a permanency of\nmotion would follow. The proximity of the magnet, on the other hand (to the\niron), is not permanent, but depends on a certain activity and the adjustment\nof the magnet in a certain position; hence the (lame) man and the magnet do\nnot supply really parallel instances.--The pradhana then being non-intelligent\nand the soul indifferent, and there being no third principle to connect them,\nthere can be no connexion of the two. If we attempted to establish a connexion\non the ground of capability (of being seen on the part of the pradhana, of\nseeing on the part of the soul), the permanency of such capability would imply\nthe impossibility of final release.--Moreover, here as well as before (in the\npreceding Sutra) the different alternatives connected with the absence of\npurpose (on the pradhana's part) have to be considered 1.--The highest Self,\non the other hand (which is the cause of the world, according to the\nVedantins), is characterised by non-activity inherent in its own nature, and,\nat the same time, by moving power inherent in Maya and is thus superior (to\nthe soul of the Sa _n_ khyas).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[374:1](sbe34183.htm#fr_336) On the theory that the soul is the cause of the\npradhana's activity we again have to ask whether the pradhana acts for the\nsoul's enjoyment or for its release, &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 8](sbe34184.htm)\n\n"
