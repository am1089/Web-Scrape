Bali styled,  \nOf Vanar tribes that roam the wild.  \nSay why dost thou this gate molest,  \nAnd bellowing thus disturb our rest?  \nI know thee, mighty fiend: beware  \nAnd guard thy life with wiser care.\'  \nHe spoke: and thus the fiend returned,  \nWhile red with rage his eyeballs burned:  \n\'What! speak when all thy dames are nigh  \nAnd hero-like thy foe defy?  \n\nCome, meet me in the fight this day,  \nAnd learn my strength by bold assay.  \nOr shall I spare tbee, and relent  \nUntil the coming night be spent?  \nTake then the respite of a night  \nAnd yield thee to each soft delight.  \nThen, monarch of the Vanar race.  \nWith loving arms thy friends embrace.  \nGifts on thy faithful lords bestow,  \nBid each and all farewell, and go.  \nShow in the streets once more thy face,  \nInstal thy son to fill thy place.  \nDally a while with each dear dame;  \nAnd then my strength thy pride shall tame  \nFor, should I smite thee drunk with wine  \nEnamoured of those dames of thine,  \nBeneath diseases bowed and bent,  \nOr weak, unarmed, or negligent,  \nMy deed would merit hate and scorn  \nAs his who slays the child unborn.\'  \nThen Bali\'s soul with rage was tired,  \nQueen Tara and the dames retired;  \nAnd slowly, with a laugh of pride,  \nThe king of Vanars thus replied:  \n\'Me, fiend, thou deemest drunk with wine:  \nUnless thy fear the fight decline,  \nCome, meet me in the fray, and test  \nThe spirit of my valiant breast.\'  \nHe spoke in wrath and high disdain;  \nAnd, laying down his golden chain,  \nGift of his sire Mahendra, dared  \nThe demon, for the fray prepared;  \nSeized by the horns the monster, vast  \nAs a huge hill, and held him fast,  \nThen fiercely dragged him round and round,  \nAnd, shouting, hurled him to the ground.  \nBlood streaming from his ears, he rose,  \nAnd wild with fury strove the foes.  \nThen Bali, match for Indra\'s might,  \nWith every arm renewed the fight.  \nHe fought with fists, and feet, and knees,  \nWith fragments of the rock, and trees.  \nAt last the monster\'s strength, assailed  \nBy S\'akra\'s  1b conquering offspring, failed.  \nHim Bali raised with mighty strain.  \nAnd dashed upon the ground again;  \nWhere, bruised and shattered, in a tide  \nOf rushing blood, the demon died.  \nKing Bali saw the lifeless corse,  \nAnd bending, with tremendous force  \nRaised the huge bulk from where it lay,  \nAnd hurled it full a league away.  \nAs through the air the body flew,  \nSome blood-drops, caught by gales that blew,  \nWelled from his shattered jaw and fell  \nBy Saint Matanga\'s hermit cell:  \nMatanga saw, illustrious sage,  \nThose drops defile his hermitage,  \n\np. 337  \n\nAnd, as he marvelled whence they came,  \nFierce anger filled his soul with flame:  \n\'Who is the villain, evil-souled,  \nWith childish thoughts unwise and bold,  \nWho is the impious wretch,\' he cried,  \n\'By whom my grove with blood is dyed?\'  \n\nThus spoke Matanga in his rage,  \nAnd hastened from the hermitage,  \nWhen lo, before his wondering eyes  \nLay the dead bull of mountain size  \nHis hermit soul was nothing slow  \nThe doer of the deed to know,  \nAnd thus the Vanar in a burst  \nOf wild tempestuous wrath he cursed:  \n\'Ne\'er let that Vanar wander here,  \nFor, if he come, his death is near.  \nWhose impious hand with blood has dyed  \nThe holy place where I abide,  \nWho threw this demon corse and made  \nA ruin of the pleasant shade.  \nIf e\'er he plant his wicked feet  \nWithin one league of my retreat;  \nYea, if the villain come so nigh  \nThat very hour he needs must die.  \nAnd let the Vanar lords who dwell  \nIn the dark woods that skirt my cell  \nObey my words, and speeding hence  \nFind them some meeter residence.  \nHere if they dare to stay, on all  \nThe terrors of my curse shall fall.  \nThey spoil the tender saplings, dear  \nAs children which I cherish here,  \nMar root and branch and leaf and spray,  \nAnd steal the ripening fruit away.  \nOne day I grant, no further hour,  \nTo-morrow shall my curse have power,  \nAnd then each Vanar I may see  \nA stone through countless years shall be.\'  \nThe Vanars heard the curse and hied  \nFrom sheltering wood and mountain side.  \nKing Bali marked their haste and dread,  \nAnd to the flying leaders said:  \n\'Speak, Vanar chiefs, and tell me why  \nFrom Saint Matanga\'s grove ye fly  \nTo gather round me: is it well  \nWith all who in those woodlands dwell?\'  \nHe spoke: the Vanar leaders told  \nKing Bali with his chain of gold  \nWhat curse the saint had on them laid,  \nWhich drove them from their ancient shade.  \nThen royal Bali sought the sage,  \nWith reverent hands to soothe his rage.  \nThe holy man his suppliant spurned,  \nAnd to his cell in anger turned.  \nThat curse on Bali sorely pressed.  \nAnd long his conscious soul distressed.  \nHim still the curse and terror keep  \nAfar from Rishyamuka\'s steep.  \nHe dares not to the grove draw nigh,  \nNay scarce will hither turn his eye.  \nWe know what terrors warm him hence,  \nAnd roam these woods in confidence.  \nLook, Prince, before thee white and dry  \nThe demon\'s bones uncovered lie,  \nWho, like a hill in bulk and length,  \nFell ruind for his pride of strength.  \nSee those high Sal trees seven in row  \nThat droop their mighty branches low,  \nThese at one grasp would Bali seize,  \nAnd leafless shake the trembling trees.  \nThese tales I tell, O Prince, to show  \nThe matchless power that arms the foe.  \nHow canst thou hope to slay him? how  \nMeet Bali in the battle now?\'  \n\nSugriva spoke and sadly sighed:  \nAnd Lakshman with a laugh replied:  \n\'What show of power, what proof and test  \nMay still the doubts that fill thy breast?\'  \n\nHe spoke. Sugriva thus replied:  \n\'See yonder Sal trees side by side.  \nKing Bali here would take his stand  \nGrasping his bow with vigorous hand,  \nAnd every arrow, keen and true.  \nWould strike its tree and pierce it through  \nIf Rama now his bow will bend,  \nAnd through one trunk an arrow send;  \nOr if his arm can raise and throw  \nTwo hundred measures of his bow,  \nGrasped by a foot and hurled through air,  \nThe demon bull that moulders there,  \nMy heart will own his might and fain  \nBelieve my foe already slain.\'  \n\nSugriva spoke inflamed with ire,  \nScanned Rama with a glance of fire,  \nPondered a while in silent mood.  \nAnd thus again his speech renewed:  \n\'All lands with Bali\'s glories ring,  \nA valiant, strong, and mighty king;  \nIn conscious power unused to yield;  \nA hero first in every field.  \nHis wondrous deeds his might declare,  \nDeeds Gods might scarcely do or dare;  \nAnd on this power reflecting still  \nI roam on Rishyamuka\'s hill.  \nAwed by my brother\'s might I rove,  \nIn doubt and fear, from grove to grove,  \nWhile Hanuman, my chosen friend,  \nAnd faithful lords my steps attend;  \nAnd now, O true to friendship\'s tie,  \nI hail in thee my best ally.  \nMy surest refuge from my foes,  \nAnd steadfast as the Lord of Snows.  \nStill, when I muse how strong and bold  \nIs cruel Bali, evil-souled,  \nBut ne\'er, O chief of Raghu\'s line,  \nHave seen what strength in war is thine,  \nThough in my heart I may not dare  \nDoubt thy great might, despise, compare,  \nThoughts of his fearful deeds will rise  \nAnd fill my soul with sad surmise.  \nSpeech, form, and trust which naught may move  \n\np. 338  \n\nThy secret strength and glory prove,  \nAs smouldering ashes dimly show  \nThe dormant fires that live below.\'  \n   He ceased: and Rama answered, while  \nPlayed o\'er his lips a gracious smile:  \n\'Not yet convinced? This clear assay  \nShall drive each lingering doubt away.\'  \nThus Rama spoke his heart to cheer,  \nTo Dundubhi\'s vast frame drew near:  \nHe touched it with his foot in play  \nAnd sent it twenty leagues away.  \nSugriva marked what easy force  \nHurled through the air that demon\'s corse  \nWhose mighty bones were white and dried,  \nAnd to the son of Raghu cried:  \n\'My brother Bali, when his might  \nWas drunk and weary from the fight,  \nHurled forth the monster body, fresh  \nWith skin and sinews, blood and flesh.  \nNow flesh and blood are dried away.  \nThe crumbling bones are light as hay,  \nWhich thou, O Raghu\'s son, hast sent  \nFlying through air in merriment.  \nThis test alone is weak to show  \nIf thou be stronger or the foe.  \nBy thee a heap of mouldering bone,  \nBy him the recent corse was thrown.  \nThy strength, O Prince, is yet untried:  \nCome, pierce one tree: let this decide.  \nPrepare thy ponderous bow and bring  \nClose to thine ear the straining string.  \nOn yonder Sal tree fix thine eye,  \nAnd let the mighty arrow fly,  \nI doubt not, chief, that I shall see  \nThy pointed shaft transfix the tree.  \nThen come, assay the easy task,  \nAnd do for love the thing I ask.  \n   Best of all lights, the Day-God fills  \n     With glory earth and sky:  \n   Himalaya is the lord of hills  \n     That heave their heads on high.  \n   The royal lion is the best  \n     Of beasts that tread the earth;  \n   And thou, O hero, art confessed  \n     First in heroic worth.\'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[335:1](ry285.htm#fr_568) Righteous because he never transgresses his bounds,\nand  \n    "over his great tides  \n    Fidelity presides."  \n\n[335:2](ry285.htm#fr_569) Himalaya, the Lord of Snow, is the father of Uma the\nwife of S\'iva or S\'ankar.\n\n[335:3](ry285.htm#fr_570) Indra\'s celestial elephant.\n\n[336:1](ry285.htm#fr_571) Bali was the son of Indra.
