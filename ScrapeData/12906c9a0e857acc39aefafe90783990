The declaration (made by Indra about himself, viz. that he is one with\nBrahman) (is possible) through intuition vouched for by Scripture, as in the\ncase of Vamadeva.\n\nThe individual divine Self called Indra perceiving by means of _ri_ shi-like\nintuition 1\\--the existence of which is vouched for by Scripture--its own Self\nto be identical with the supreme Self, instructs Pratardana (about the highest\nSelf) by means of the words 'Know me only.'\n\nBy intuition of the same kind the _ri_ shi Vamadeva reached the knowledge\nexpressed in the words, 'I was Manu and Surya;' in accordance with the\npassage, 'Whatever deva was awakened (so as to know Brahman) he indeed became\nthat' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10). The assertion made above (in the purvapaksha of\nthe preceding Sutra) that Indra after saying, 'Know me only,' glorifies\nhimself by enumerating the slaying of Tvash _tri_ 's son and other deeds of\nstrength, we refute as follows. The death of Tvash _tri_ 's son and similar\ndeeds are referred to, not to the end of glorifying Indra as the object of\nknowledge--in which case the sense of the passage would be, 'Because I\naccomplished such and such deeds, therefore know me'--but to the end of\nglorifying the cognition of the highest Self. For this reason the text, after\nhaving referred to the slaying of Tvash _tri_ 's son and the like, goes on in\nthe clause next following to exalt knowledge, 'And not one hair of me is\nharmed there. He who knows me thus by no deed of his is his life\nharmed.'--(But how does this passage convey praise of knowledge?)--Because, we\nreply, its meaning is as follows: 'Although I do such cruel deeds,\n\np. 102\n\nyet not even a hair of mine is harmed because I am one with Brahman; therefore\nthe life of any other person also who knows me thus is not harmed by any deed\nof his.' And the object of the knowledge (praised by Indra) is nothing else\nbut Brahman which is set forth in a subsequent passage, 'I am pra _n_ a, the\nintelligent Self.' Therefore the entire chapter refers to Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[101:1](sbe34036.htm#fr_135) I.e. spontaneous intuition of supersensible\ntruth, rendered possible through the knowledge acquired in former existences.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 31](sbe34037.htm)\n\n"
