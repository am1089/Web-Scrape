Charm to promote virility.\n\n1\\. Thee, the plant, which the Gandharva dug up for Varuna, when his virility\nhad decayed, thee, that causest strength[1], we dig up.  \n2\\. Ushas (Aurora), Surya, (the sun), and this charm of mine; the bull\nPragapati (the lord of creatures) shall with his lusty fire arouse him!  \n3\\. This herb shall make thee so very full of lusty strength, that thou shalt,\nwhen thou art excited, exhale heat as a thing on fire!  \n4\\. The fire of the plants, and the essence of the bulls shall arouse him! Do\nthou, O Indra, controller of bodies, place the lusty force of men into this\nperson!  \n5\\. Thou (O herb) art the first-born sap of the waters and also of the plants.\nMoreover thou art the brother of Soma, and the lusty force of the antelope\nbuck!  \n6\\. Now, O Agni, now, O Savitar, now, O goddess Sarasvati, now, O\nBrahmanaspati, do thou stiffen the pasas as a bow!  \n7\\. I stiffen thy pasas as a bowstring upon the bow. Embrace thou (women) as\nthe antelope buck the gazelle with ever unfailing (strength)!  \n8\\. The strength of the horse, the mule, the goat and the ram, moreover the\nstrength of the bull bestow upon him, O controller of bodies (Indra)!\n\n[1. The original, more drastically, sepaharshanim. By a few changes and\nomissions in stanzas 3, 6, and 7 the direct simplicity of the original has\nbeen similarly veiled.]\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 111. Charm against mania](av049.htm)\n\n'
