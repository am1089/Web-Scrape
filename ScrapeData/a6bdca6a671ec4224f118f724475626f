Not the Self, on account of scriptural statement, and on account of the\neternity (which results) from them.\n\nThe Sutras so far have stated that this entire world, from Ether downwards,\noriginates from the highest Brahman. It now becomes a matter for discussion\nwhether the individual soul also originates in the same way or not.--It does\nso originate, the Purvapakshin maintains. For on this assumption only the\nscriptural statement as to the cognition of all things through the cognition\nof one thing holds good, and moreover Scripture declares that before creation\neverything was one. Moreover, there are texts directly stating that the soul\nalso was produced in the same way as Ether and other created things.\n\n'Pra _g_ apati sent forth all creatures'; 'All these creatures have their root\nin the True, they abide in the True, they rest on the True' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8,\n6); 'From whence these beings are produced' (Taitt. Up. III, 1, 1). As these\npassages declare the origination of the world inclusive of sentient beings, we\nconclude that the souls also originate. Nor must this be objected to on the\nground than from the fact that Brahman is eternal, and the other fact that\ntexts\n\np. 541\n\nsuch as 'That art them' teach the soul to be of the nature of Brahman, it\nfollows that the soul also is eternal. For if we reasoned in this style we\nshould have to admit also that the Ether and the other elements are eternal,\nsince texts such as 'in that all this has its Self' and 'all this indeed is\nBrahman 'intimate them also to be of the nature of Brahman. Hence the\nindividual soul also originates no less than Ether and the rest.--To this the\nSutra replies, 'Not the Self, on account of scriptural statement.' The Self is\nnot produced, since certain texts directly deny its origination; cp. 'the\nintelligent one is not born nor does he die' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 18); 'There are\ntwo unborn ones, one intelligent and strong, the other non-intelligent and\nweak' ( _S_ vet. Up. I, 9). And the eternity of the soul is learned from the\nsame texts, cp. 'There is one eternal thinker,' &c. (Ka. Up. II,5, 13);\n'Unborn, eternal, everlasting is that ancient one; he is not killed though the\nbody is killed' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 18).--For these reasons the soul is not\nproduced.\n\nBut how then about the declaration that through the cognition of one thing\neverything is known?-There is no difficulty here, since the soul also is an\neffect, and since effect and cause are non-different.--But this implies that\nthe soul is an originated thing just like Ether and so on!--Not so, we reply.\nBy a thing being an effect we mean its being due to a substance passing over\ninto some other state; and from this point of view the soul also is an effect.\nThere is,however, the difference,that the 'other condition' which is\nrepresented by the soul is of a different kind from that which constitutes\nnon-sentient things, such as Ether and so on. The 'otherness' on which the\nsoul depends consists in the contraction and expansion of intelligence; while\nthe change on which the origination of Ether and so on depends is a change of\nessential nature. And change of the latter kind is what we deny of the soul.\nWe have shown that there are three entities of distinct nature, viz. objects\nof fruition, enjoying subjects, and a Ruler; that origination and so on which\nare characteristic of the objects do not belong to the subjects, and that the\nlatter are eternal; that the characteristic qualities of the objects and\n\np. 542\n\nlikewise those of the subjects--viz. liability to pain and suffering--do not\nbelong to the Ruler; that the latter is eternal, free from all imperfections,\nomniscient, immediately realising all his purposes, the Lord of the lords of\nthe organs, the highest Lord of all; and that sentient and non-sentient beings\nin all their states constitute the body of the Lord while he constitutes their\nSelf. While Brahman thus has for its modes (prakara) the sentient and non-\nsentient beings in which it ever is embodied, during certain periods those\nbeings abide in so subtle a condition as to be incapable of receiving\ndesignations different from that of Brahman itself; Brahman then is said to be\nin its causal state. When, on the other hand, its body is constituted by all\nthose beings in their gross state, when they have separate, distinct names and\nforms, Brahman is said to be in its effected condition. When, now, Brahman\npasses over from the causal state into the effected state, the aggregate of\nnon-sentient things which in the causal state were destitute of name and form\nundergoes an essential change of nature--implying the possession of distinct\nnames and so on--so as to become fit to constitute objects of fruition for\nsentient beings; the change, on the other hand, which the sentient beings (the\nsouls) undergo on that occasion is nothing more than a certain expansion of\nintelligence (or consciousness), capacitating them to experience the different\nrewards or punishments for their previous deeds. The ruling element of the\nworld, i.e. the Lord, finally, who has the sentient and non-sentient beings\nfor his modes, undergoes a change in so far as he is, at alternating periods,\nembodied in all those beings in their alternating states. The two modes, and\nhe to whom the modes belong, thus undergo a common change in so far as in the\ncase of all of them the causal condition passes over into a different\ncondition.\n\nIt is with reference to this change undergone by one substance in passing over\ninto a different state that the _Kh_ andogya says that through the knowledge\nof one thing everything is known, and illustrates this by the case of the lump\nof clay (knowing which we know all things made of clay). Texts such as 'Pra\n_g_ apati sent forth the creatures,'\n\np. 543\n\nwhich declare the origination of the soul, really mean only to state that the\nsouls are by turns associated with or dissociated from bodies--the effect of\nwhich is that their intelligence is either contracted or expanded. Texts again\nwhich deny the origination of the soul and affirm its permanency ('He is not\nborn and does not die,' &c.) mean to say that the soul does not, like the non-\nsentient element of creation, undergo changes of essential nature. And finally\nthere are texts the purport of which it is to declare the absence of change of\nessential nature as well as of alternate expansion and contraction of\nintelligence--cp. 'That is the great unborn Self, undecaying, undying,\nimmortal, Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 25); 'the eternal thinker,' &c. (Ka.\nUp. II, 5, 13); such texts have for their subject the highest Lord.--All this\nalso explains how Brahman, which is at all times differentiated by the\nsentient and non-sentient beings that constitute its body, can be said to be\none only previous to creation; the statement is possible because at that time\nthe differentiation of names and forms did not exist. That that which makes\nthe difference between plurality and unity is the presence or absence of\ndifferentiation through names and forms, is distinctly declared in the text,\n'Now all this was undifferentiated. It became differentiated by form and name'\n(B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 7).--Those also who hold that the individual soul is due to\nNescience; and those who hold it to be due to a real limiting adjunct\n(upadhi); and those who hold that Brahman, whose essential nature is mere\nBeing, assumes by itself the threefold form of enjoying subjects, objects of\nenjoyment, and supreme Ruler; can all of them explain the unity which\nScripture predicates of Brahman in the pralaya state, only on the basis of the\nabsence of differentiation by names and forms; for according to them also\n(there is no absolute unity at any time, but) either the potentiality of\nNescience, or the potentiality of the limiting adjunct, or the potentialities\nof enjoying subjects, objects of enjoyment, and supreme Ruler persist in the\npralaya condition also. And, moreover, it is proved by the two Sutras, II, 1,\n33; 35, that the distinction of the several individual souls and the stream of\ntheir works are eternal.\n\np. 544\n\nThere is, however, the following difference between those several views. The\nfirst-mentioned view implies that Brahman itself is under the illusive\ninfluence of beginningless Avidya. According to the second view, the effect of\nthe real and beginningless limiting adjunct is that Brahman itself is in the\nstate of bondage; for there is no other entity but Brahman and the adjunct.\nAccording to the third view, Brahman itself assumes different forms, and\nitself experiences the various unpleasant consequences of deeds. Nor would it\navail to say that that part of Brahman which is the Ruler is not an\nexperiencing subject; for as Brahman is all-knowing it recognises the enjoying\nsubject as non-different from itself, and thus is itself an enjoying subject.\n--According to our view, on the other hand, Brahman, which has for its body\nall sentient and non-sentient beings, whether in their subtle or their gross\nstate, is always--in its effected as well as in its causal condition free from\nall shadow of imperfection, and a limitless ocean as it were of all exalted\nqualities. All imperfections, and suffering, and all change belong not to\nBrahman, but only to the sentient and non-sentient beings which are its modes.\nThis view removes all difficulties.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of\n'the Self.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 19.
