Kaikeyi, touch me not.  \nNo loving wife, no friend to me,  \nI ne'er again would look on thee;  \nNe'er from this day have aught to do  \nWith thee and all thy retinue;  \nThee whom no virtuous thoughts restrain,  \nWhose selfish heart seeks only gain.  \nThe hand I laid in mine, O dame,  \nThe steps we took around the flame,  1b  \nAnd all that links thy life to mine  \nHere and hereafter I resign.  \nIf Bharat too, thy darling son,  \nJoy in the rule thy art has won,  \nNe'er may the funeral offerings paid  \nBy his false hand approach my shade.'  \n   Then while the dust upon him hung,  \nThe monarch to Kaus'alya clung,  \nAnd she with mournful steps and slow  \nTurned to the palace, worn with woe.  \nAs one whose hand has touched the fire,  \nOr slain a Brahman in his ire,  \nHe felt his heart with sorrow torn  \nStill thinking of his son forlorn.  \nEach step was torture, as the road  \nThe traces of the chariot showed,  \nAnd as the shadowed sun grows dim  \nSo cure and anguish darkened him.  \nHe raised a cry, by woe distraught,  \nAs of his son again he thought.  \nAnd judging that the car had sped  \nBeyond the city, thus he said:  \n'I still behold the foot-prints made  \nBy the good horses that conveyed  \nMy son afar: these marks I see,  \nBut high-souled Rama, where is he?  \nAh me, my son! my first and best,  \nOn pleasant conches wont to rest,  \nWith limbs perfumed with sandal, fanned  \nBy many a beauty's tender hand:  \nWhere will he lie with log or stone  \nBeneath him for a pillow thrown,  \nTo leave at morn his earthy bed,  \nNeglected, and with dust o'erspread,  \nAs from the flood with sigh and pant  \nComes forth the husband elephant?  \nThe men who make the woods their home  \nShall see the long-armed hero roam  \nRoused from his bed, though lord of all,  \nIn semblance of a friendless thrall.  \nJanak's dear child who ne'er has met  \n\np. 145  \n\nWith aught save joy and comfort yet,  \nWill reach to-day the forest, worn  \nAnd wearied with the brakes of thorn.  \nAh, gentle girl, of woods unskilled,  \nHow will her heart with dread be filled  \nAt the wild beasts' deep roaring there,  \nWhose voices lift the shuddering hair!  \nKaikeyi, glory in thy gain,  \nAnd, widow queen, begin to reign:  \nNo will, no power to live have I  \nWhen my brave son no more is nigh.'  \n   Thus pouring forth laments, the king,  \nGirt by the people's crowded ring,  \nEntered the noble bower like one  \nNew-bathed when funeral rites are done.  \nWhere'er he looked naught met his gaze  \nBut empty houses, courts, and ways.  \nClosed were the temples: countless feet  \nNo longer trod the royal street,  \nAnd thinking of his son he viewed  \nMen weak and worn and woe-subdued.  \nAs sinks the sun into a cloud,  \nSo passed he on, and wept aloud,  \nWithin that house no more to be  \nThe dwelling of the banished three,  \nBrave Rama, his Videhan bride,  \nAnd Lakshman by his brother's side:  \nLike broad still waters, when the king  \nOf all the birds that ply the wing  \nHas swooped from heaven and borne away  \nThe glittering snakes that made them gay.  \nWith choking sobs and voice half spent  \nThe king renewed his sad lament:  \nWith broken utterance faint and low  \nScarce could he speak these words of woe:  \n'My steps to Rama's mother guide,  \nAnd place me by Kaus'alya's side:  \nThere, only there my heart may know  \nSome little respite from my woe.'  \n   The warders of the palace led  \nThe monarch, when his words were said,  \nTo Queen Kaus'alya's bower, and there  \nLaid him with reverential care.  \nBut while he rested on the bed  \nStill was his soul disquieted.  \nIn grief he tossed his arms on high  \nLamenting with a piteous cry:  \n'O Rama, Rama,' thus said he,  \n'My son, thou hast forsaken me.  \nHigh bliss awaits those favoured men  \nLeft living in Ayodhya then,  \nWhose eyes shall see my son once more  \nReturning when the time is o'er.'  \nThen came the night, whose hated gloom  \nFell on him like the night of doom.  \nAt midnight Das'aratha cried  \nTo Queen Kaus'alya by his side:  \nI see thee not, Kaus'alya; lay  \nThy gentle hand in mine, I pray.  \nWhen Rama left his home my sight  \nWent with him, nor returns to-night.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[144:1](ry119.htm#fr_315) See p. 72.\n\n[144:2](ry119.htm#fr_316) Four stars of the sixteenth lunar asterism.\n\n[144:1b](ry120.htm#fr_317) In the marriage service.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLIII.: Kaus'alya's Lament.](ry121.htm)\n\n"
