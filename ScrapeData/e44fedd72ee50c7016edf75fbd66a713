When Shree Krishnu came at midnight on a Wednesday, the eighth of the\ndark part of the month Bhadon, Jusodha being awake at the time, and having\nbeheld her son\'s face, sending for Nund, was highly delighted, and thought\nthat she had gained every object of her life. Early in the morning, Nund Jee\nhaving got up sent for pundits and astrologers, who came with their books and\nalmanacks, and Nund offered them seats with great respect, and honour. They,\naccording to the precepts of the Shastrus, having fixed upon the year, month,\nlunar-day, solar-day, division of the zodiack, the lucky moment, and exact,\nray of light, and having considered the rising of a sign of the zodiack, and\nhaving settled a division of time equal to (48) forty-eight minutes, said,--"O\ngreat king! after consulting our Shastrus we are of opinion, that the child\nabout to be born will be a second deity, as Bruhmu; having destroyed all evil\nspirits, and relieved the burthens of Bruj, he shall be called the lord of\ncowherdesses, and the whole world shall sing his praises." On hearing this,\nNund Jee\n\np. 29\n\nmade a vow to offer up two hundred thousand, (200,000) cows, with horns of\ngold, hoofs of silver, backs of copper, and arrayed in yellow silk robes; and\nhaving given all sorts of gifts and presents to Brahmins, ands receiving their\nblessing, he dismissed them--After this, he sent for all the musicians and\nsingers of the city: they came, and began to display their accomplishments;\nthe musicians to play, the dancers to dance, singers to sing, and the bards to\ncelebrate praises. And all the cowherds of Gokool made their wives bring\nvessels, containing sour milk, on their heads. Assuming various disguises,\ndancing and singing, they came to offer congratulatory presents to Nund. On\ntheir arrival, they threw about, and at each other, so much coagulated milk\nand clay, that the whole of Gokool seemed to be covered with coagulated milk--\nWhen they had finished this sport, Nund having entertained them all, presented\nthem with dresses, made the marks of " _tiluk_ " on their foreheads, and given\nthem pawn, (betle leaf,) dismissed them.\n\nThe congratulations lasted in this manner for some days:--during this time,\nevery one obtained whatever he asked from Nund Jee. Being free from the\ncongratulations, Nund Jee sent for all the cowherds, and said to them,\n"Brothers! I have heard that Kuns is laying hold of all the little children\n"he can find; there is no knowing but some wicked person may say something\nagainst us; for which reason it is proper that we should in a body take\npresents, and offer annual tribute." They all agreed to this, and taking with\nthem from their houses, milk, curds, butter and money, loading them on carts,\nthey came from Gokool to Muttra, accompanied by Nund. Having had an interview\nwith Kuns, they offered presents, and having paid their tribute, being\npermitted to depart, making their salutations, they returned homewards.\n\nWhen they reached the bank of the Jumna, Basoodeo Jee having received\ninformation of their coming, went there also: embracing Nund, and making\nenquiries regarding his affairs, he began to say, "I have not such a relative\nand friend\n\np. 30\n\nas you in the whole world, because when a great calamity happened to me, I\nsent Rohnee, then with child, to you. She has had a son, whom you have\nnurtured with great care-"How can I sufficiently describe your virtues?"\nSaying this, he asked him, "Tell me, are Ram Krishnu, and your wife Jusodha\nwell?" Nund Jee replied, "By your kindness all are well, and the root of my\nlife, your Buldeo Jee is also well. In consequence of his being born, by\nreason of your virtue and majesty, I also have had a son: but there is one of\nyour griefs, which much afflicts me." Busoodeo said, "Friend! we have no power\nover the deity, the lines of fate cannot he effaced by one. For this reason,\nafter coming into the world, who should regret, if he suffers pain and\naffliction." Having thus informed him, he said, "Go quickly to your home, Kuns\nhas committed many acts of violence; the vile wretch is making search for, and\nhaving brought to him all the infant children he can: good subjects have been\nput to death, you have all come here, and evil spirits are on the search, and\nprowling about: who knows but that some wicked person may go to Gokool, and\ncause injustice to be done." On hearing this, Nund Jee being agitated, and\ntaking all with him, engaged in thought, went from Muttra to Gokool.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VII](psa08.htm)\n\n'
