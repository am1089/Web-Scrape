II.\n\nRedeeming properties of the Kali age. Devotion to Vishn\xcc\x81u sufficient to\nsalvation in that age for all castes and persons.\n\nUPON this subject, Maitreya, you shall hear what the wise Vyasa has related,\nas it is communicated truly by me.\n\nIt was once a matter of dispute amongst the sages, at what season the least\nmoral merit obtained the greatest reward, and by whom it was most easily\ndisplayed. In order to terminate the discussion, they went to Veda Vyasa to\nremove their doubts. They found the illustrious Muni, my son, half immersed in\nthe water of the Ganges; and awaiting the close of his ablutions, the sages\nremained on the banks of the sacred stream, under shelter of a grove of trees.\nAs my son plunged down into the water, and again rose up from it, the Munis\nheard him exclaim, "Excellent, excellent, is the Kali age!" Again he dived,\nand again rising, said in their hearing, "Well done, well done \xc5\x9audra; thou art\nhappy!" Again he sank down, and as he once more emerged they heard him say,\n"Well done, well done, women; they are happy! who are more fortunate than\nthey?" After this, my son finished his bathing, and the sages met him as he\napproached to welcome them. After he had given them seats, and they had\nproffered their respects, the son of Satyavati said to them, "On what account\nhave you come to me?" They replied, "We came to you to consult you on a\nsubject on which we entertain some doubt; but that may be at present\nsuspended: explain to us something else. We heard you say, \'Excellent is the\nKali age! Well done, \xc5\x9audra! Well done, women!\' Now we are desirous to know why\nthis was said, why you called them repeatedly, happy. Tell us the meaning of\nit, if it be not a mystery. We will then propose to you the question that\noccupies our thoughts."\n\nBeing thus addressed by the Munis, Vyasa smiled, and said to them, "Hear,\nexcellent sages, why I uttered the words \'Well done, well done.\' The fruit of\npenance, of continence, of silent prayer, and the like, practised in the Krita\nage for ten years, in the Treta for one year, in the Dwapara for a month, is\nobtained in the Kali age in a day and night: therefore did I exclaim,\n\'Excellent, excellent, is the Kali age!\' That\n\np. 628\n\nreward which a man obtains in the Krita by abstract meditation, in the Treta\nby sacrifice, in the Dwapara by adoration, he receives in the Kali by merely\nreciting the name of Ke\xc5\x9bava. In the Kali age a man displays the most exalted\nvirtue by very little exertion; therefore, pious sages, who know what virtue\nis, I was pleased with the Kali age. Formerly the Vedas were to be acquired by\nthe twice-born through the diligent observance of self-denial; and it was\ntheir duty to celebrate sacrifices conformably to the ritual. Then idle\nprayers, idle feasts, and fruitless ceremonies, were practised but to mislead\nthe twice-born; for although observed by them devoutly, yet, in consequence of\nsome irregularity in their celebration, sin was incurred in all their works,\nand what they ate, or what they drank, did not effect the fulfilment of their\ndesires. In all their objects the twice-born enjoyed no independence, and they\nattained their respective spheres only with exceeding pain. The \xc5\x9audra, on the\ncontrary, more fortunate than they, reaches his assigned station by rendering\nthem service, and performing merely the sacrifice of preparing food, in which\nno rules determine what may or may not be eaten, what may or may not be drunk.\nTherefore, most excellent sages, is the \xc5\x9audra fortunate.\n\n"Riches are accumulated by men in modes not incompatible with their peculiar\nduties, and they are then to be bestowed upon the worthy, and expended in\nconstant sacrifice. There is great trouble in their acquisition; great care in\ntheir preservation; great distress from the want of them; and great grief for\ntheir loss. Thus, eminent Brahmans, through these and other sources of\nanxiety, men attain their allotted spheres of Prajapati and the rest only by\nexceeding labour and suffering. This is not the case with women: a woman has\nonly to honour her husband, in act, thought, and speech, to reach the same\nregion to which he is elevated; and she thus accomplishes her object without\nany great exertion. This was the purport of my exclamation, \'Well done!\' the\nthird time. I have thus related to you what you asked. Now demand the question\nyou came to put to me, in any way you please, and I will make you a distinct\nreply."\n\nThe Munis then said to Vyasa, "The question we intended to have asked you has\nbeen already answered by you in your reply to our\n\np. 629\n\nsubsequent inquiry." On hearing which, Krishn\xcc\x81a Dwaipayana laughed, and said\nto the holy persons who had come to see him, whose eyes were wide open with\nastonishment, "I perceived, with the eye of divine knowledge, the question you\nintended to ask, and in allusion to it I uttered the expressions, \'Well done,\nwell done.\' In truth, in the Kali age duty is discharged with very little\ntrouble by mortals, whose faults are all washed away by the water of their\nindividual merits; by \xc5\x9audras, through diligent attendance only upon the twice-\nborn; and by women, through the slight effort of obedience to their husbands.\nTherefore, Brahmans, did I thrice express my admiration of their happiness;\nfor in the Krita and other ages great were the toils of the regenerate to\nperform their duty. I waited not for your inquiry, but replied at once to the\nquestion you purposed to ask. Now, ye who know what virtue is, what else do\nyou wish me to tell you?"\n\nThe Munis then saluted and praised Vyasa, and, being freed by him from\nuncertainty, departed as they came. To you also, excellent Maitreya, have I\nimparted this secret, this one great virtue of the otherwise vicious Kali age.\nThe dissolution of the world, and the aggregation of the elements, I will now\ndescribe to you 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[629:1](vp157.htm#fr_1611) The illustration of the efficacy of devotion to\nVishn\xcc\x81u given in this chapter is peculiar to this Puran\xcc\x81a, but the doctrine is\ncommon to it and the Bhagavata. It is repeatedly inculcated in that work. The\nparallel passage in the twelfth book is the following. "Purushottama, abiding\nin the hearts of men, takes away all the sins of the Kali age, produced by\nplace or property. Bhagavan, abiding in the heart, and heard, repeated, read\nof, worshipped, or honoured, dissipates the ills of men for ten thousand\nbirths. As fire, entering into the substance of gold, purifies it from the\nalloy with which it is debased in the mine, so Vishn\xcc\x81u, united with the\ndevotee, is the refiner from all that is evil. By learning, penance,\nsuppression of breath, friendship, pilgrimage, ablution, mortification, gifts,\nprayer, the soul attains not that exceeding purity which it derives from the\npresence of Vishn\xcc\x81u. Therefore, with all your soul, O king, hold Ke\xc5\x9bava ever\npresent in your heart. Let one about to die be most careful in this; for so he\ngoes to supreme felicity. Let the name of the supreme god, Vishn\xcc\x81u, be\nrepeated diligently by all in their last moments; for he who desires\nliberation shall attain it by the frequent repetition of the name of Krishn\xcc\x81a.\nFinal felicity is derived in the Krita age from holy study; in the Treta, from\nreligious rites. In the Dwapara it is attained by pious services; but in the\nKali age it is secured by repeating the name of Hari." Similar doctrines are\ntaught in the Git\xcc\x81a, and other Vaishn\xcc\x81ava works. See As. Res. vol. XVI. p.\n116.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III](vp158.htm)\n\n'
