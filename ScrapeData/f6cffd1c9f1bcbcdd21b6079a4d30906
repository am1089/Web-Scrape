 \nIts limbs how fine, its hues how fair!  \nTranscending all that words express,  \nIt takes my soul with loveliness.  \nO, if thou would, to please me, strive  \nTo take the beauteous thing alive,  \nHow thou wouldst gaze with wondering eyes  \nDelighted on the lovely prize!  \nAnd when our woodland life is o'er,  \nAnd we enjoy our realm once more,  \nThe wondrous animal will grace  \nThe chambers of my dwelling-place,  \nAnd a dear treasure will it be  \nTo Bharat and the queens and me,  \nAnd all with rapture and amaze  \nUpon its heavenly form will gaze.  \nBut if the beauteous deer, pursued,  \nThine arts to take it still elude,  \nStrike it, O chieftain, and the akin  \nWill be a treasure, laid within.  \nO, how I long my time to pass  \nSitting upon the tender grass,  \nWith that soft fell beneath me spread  \nBright with its hair of golden thread!  \nThis strong desire, this eager will,  \nBefits a gentle lady ill:  \nBut when I first beheld, its look  \nMy breast with fascination took.  \nSee, golden hair its flank adorns,  \nAnd sapphires tip its branching horns.  \nResplendent as the lunar way,  \nOr the first blush of opening day,  \nWith graceful form and radiant hue  \nIt charmed thy heart, O chieftain, too.'  \n   He heard her speech with willing ear,  \nHe looked again upon the deer.  \nIts lovely shape his breast beguiled  \nMoved by the prayer of Janak's child,  \nAnd yielding for her pleasure's sake,  \nTo Lakshman Rama turned and spake:  \n   'Mark, Lakshman, mark how Sita's breast  \nWith eager longing is possessed.  \nTo-day this deer of wondrous breed  \nMust for his passing beauty bleed,  \nBrighter than e'er in Nandan strayed,  \nOr Chaitraratha's heavenly shade.  \n\nHow should the groves of earth possess  \nSuch all-surpassing loveliness!  \nThe hair lies smooth and bright and fine,  \nOr waves upon each curving line,  \nAnd drops of living gold bedeck  \nThe beauty of his side and neck.  \nO look, his crimson tongue between  \nHis teeth like flaming fire is seen,  \nFlashing, whene'er his lips he parts,  \nAs from a cloud the lightning darts.  \nO see his sunlike forehead shine  \nWith emerald tints and almandine,  \nWhile pearly light and roseate glow  \nOf shells adorn his neck below.  \nNo eye on such a deer can rest  \nBut soft enchantment takes the breast:  \nNo man so fair a thing behold  \nAblaze with light of radiant gold.  \nCelestial, bright with jewels' sheen,  \nNor marvel when his eyes have seen,  \nA king equipped with bow and shaft  \nDelights in gentle forest craft,  \nAnd as in boundless woods he strays  \nThe quarry for the venison slays.  \nThere as he wanders with his train  \nA store of wealth he oft may gain.  \nHe claims by right the precious ore.  \nHe claims the jewels' sparkling store.  \nSuch gains are dearer in his eyes  \nThan wealth that in his chamber lies.  \nThe dearest things his spirit knows,  \nDear as the bliss which Sukra chose.  \nBut oft the rich expected gain  \nWhich heedless men pursue in vain.  \nThe sage, who prudent counsels know,  \nExplain and in a moment show.  \nThis best of deer, this gem of all,  \nTo yield his precious spoils must fall,  \nAnd tender Sita by my side  \nShall sit upon the golden hide.  \nNe'er could I find so rich a coat  \nOn spotted deer or sheep or goat.  \nNo buck or antelope has such,  \nSo bright to view, so soft to touch.  \nThis radiant deer and one on high  \nThat moves in glory through the sky,  \nAlike in heavenly beauty are,  \nOne on the earth and one a star.  \nBut, brother, if thy fears be true,  \nAnd this bright creature that we view  \nBe fierce Maricha in disguise,  \nThen by this hand he surely dies.  \nFor that dire fiend who spurns control  \nWith bloody hand and cruel soul,  \nHas roamed this forest and dismayed  \nThe holiest saints who haunt the shade.  \nGreat archers, sprung of royal race.  \nPursuing in the wood the chase,  \nHave fallen by his wicked art,  \nAnd now my shaft shall strike his heart.  \nVatapi, by his magic power  \n\np. 280  \n\nMade heedless saints his flesh devour,  \nThen, from within their frames he rent  \nForth bursting from imprisonment,  \nBut once his art in senseless pride  \nUpon the mightiest saint he tried,  \nAgastya's self, and caused him taste  \nThe baited meal before him placed.  \nVatapi, when the rite* was o'er,  \nWould take the giant form he wore,  \nBut Saint Agastya knew his wile  \nAnd checked the giant with smile  \n'Vatapi, thou with cruel spite  \nHast conquered many an achorite  \nThe noblest of the Brahman ask*--  \nAnd now thy ruin comes at last'  \nNow if my power he thus defies,  \nThis giant, like Vatapi dies,  \nDaring to scorn a man like me,  \nA self subduing devotee.  \nYea, as Agastya slew the foe,  \nMy hand shall lay Mancha low  \nClad in thine arms thy bow in hand,  \nTo guard the Maithil lady stand,  \nWith watchful eye and thoughtful breast  \nKeeping each word of my behest  \nI go, and hunting through the brake  \nThis wondrous deer will bring or take.  \nYea surely I will bring the spoil  \nReturning from my hunter's toil  \nSee, Lakshman how my contort's eyes  \nAre longing for the lovely prize  \nThis day it falls, that I may win  \nThe treasure of so fair a skin.  \nDo thou and Sita watch with care  \nLest danger seize you unaware.  \nSwift from my bow one shaft will fly;  \nThe stricken deer will fall and die  \nThen quickly will I stop the game  \nAnd bring the trophy to my dame.  \n   Jatavus, guardian good and wise,  \n     Our old and faithful friend,  \n   The best and strongest bird that flies,  \n     His willing aid will lend  \n   The Maithil lady well protect,  \n     For every chance provide,  \n   And in thy tender care suspect  \n     A foe on every side.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[279:1](ry241.htm#fr_495) A race of beings of human shape but with the heads\nof horses, like centaurs reversed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLIV: Artcha's Death](ry242.htm)\n\n"
