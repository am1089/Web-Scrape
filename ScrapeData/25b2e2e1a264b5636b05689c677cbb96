Mozoomdar must be counted as a favourable witness. He stands\naloof from the propaganda carried on by Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a's disciples, but\nhe speaks of him in the highest terms. In a letter which he addressed to me in\nSeptember, 1895, he wrote: 'Both in Keshub's Life and Teachings, and in the\n\np. 62\n\nold _Theistic Review_ , I have frankly and warmly expressed my estimate of\nthat saintly man and our obligations to him. But there was another side of his\ncharacter, which of course one could not take up, because it was not\nedifying.' Here we see another ingredient of the Dialogic Process.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a's Language](rls17.htm)\n\n"
