Teresa and Catherine are now but high-sounding names in history;\nBeatrice, a true daughter of the Church, is beloved only of the poets; and\nJoan of Arc, better understood, is rightly felt to be by birth the nun, but by\ngenius the knight. Yet without some deeper sense of kindred with these it will\nbe hard to understand a Hindu marriage, for the Indian bride comes to her\nhusband much as the Western woman might enter a church. Their love is a\ndevotion, to be offered in secret. They know well that they are the strongest\ninfluence, each in the other\'s life, but before the family there can be no\nassertion of the fact. Their first duty is to see that the claims of others\nare duly met, for the ideal is that a wife shall, if that be possible, love\nher husband\'s people as she never loved her own; that the new parents shall be\nmore to her than the old; that she can bring no gift into their home so fair\nas a full and abundant daughterhood and a confirmation of their supreme place\nin their son\'s love. Both husband and wife must set their faces towards the\nwelfare of the family. This, and not that they should love each the other\nbefore all created beings, is the primal intention of marriage. Yet for the\nwoman supreme love also is a duty. Only to the man his\n\np. 30\n\nmother must stand always first. In some sense, therefore, the relation is not\nmutual. And this is in full accordance with the national sentiment, which\nstigmatises affection that asks for equal return as "shopkeeping." When her\nhusband is present or before honoured guests the young wife may not obtrude\nherself on the attention of her elders. She sits silent, with veil down,\nplying a fan or doing some little service for the new mother. But through the\nwork of the day she is a trusted helpmeet, and the relation is often very\nsweet. Nothing is so easy to distinguish as the educational impress of the\ngood mother-in-law. Dignity, with gaiety and freedom, is its great feature.\nThe good breeding of the Hindu woman is so perfect that it is not noticed till\none comes across the exception--some spoilt child, perhaps, who, as heiress or\nbeauty has been too much indulged; and her self-assertiveness and want of\nrestraint, though the same behaviour might seem decorous enough in an English\ngirl of her age, will serve as some measure for the real value of the common\nstandard.\n\nIt is not merely in her quietness and modesty, however, that the daughter-in-\nlaw betrays good training. She has what remains with her throughout life--a\n_savoir faire_ that nothing can disturb. I have never known this broken; and I\nsaw an extraordinary instance of it when a friend, the shyest of orthodox\nwomen, consented to have her photograph taken for one who begged it with\nurgency. She stipulated, naturally, that it should be done by a woman. But\nthis was found to be impossible. "Then let it he an Englishman," she said with\na sigh, evidently shrinking painfully from the idea of a man, yet feeling that\nthe greater the race-distance the less would be the impropriety. The morning\ncame, and the Englishman arrived, but in the Indian gentlewoman who faced him\nthere was no trace of\n\np. 31\n\nself-consciousness or fear. A superb indifference carried her through the\nordeal, and would have been a sufficient protection in some real difficulty.\nAll the sons of a Hindu household bring their wives home to their mother\'s\ncare, and she, having married her own daughters into other women\'s families,\ntakes these in their place. There is thus a constant bubbling of young life\nabout the elderly woman, and her own position becomes a mixture of the mother-\n_suzeraine_ and lady abbess. She is well aware of the gossip and laughter of\nthe girls amongst themselves, though they become so demure at her entrance.\nWhispering goes on in corners and merriment waxes high even in her presence,\nbut she ignores it discreetly, and devotes her attention to persons of her own\nage. In the early summer mornings she smiles indulgently to find that one and\nanother slipped away last night from her proper sleeping-place and betook\nherself to the roof, half for the coolness and half for the mysterious joys of\ngirls\' midnight gossip.\n\nThe relationship, however, is as far from familiarity as that of any kind and\ntrusted prioress with her novices. The element of banter and freedom has\nanother outlet, in the grandmother or whatever aged woman may take that place\nin the community house. Just as at home the little one had coaxed and appealed\nagainst the decisions of father or mother to the ever-ready granddam, so, now\nthat she is a bride, she finds some old woman in her husband\'s home who has\ngiven up her cares into younger hands and is ready to forego all\nresponsibility in the sweetness of becoming a _confidante_. One can imagine\nthe rest. There must be many a difficulty, many a perplexity, in the new\nsurroundings, but to them all old age can find some parallel. Looking back\ninto her own memories, the grandmother tells of the questions that troubled\nher when\n\np. 32\n\nshe also was a bride, of the mistakes that she made, and the solutions that\noffered. Young and old take counsel together, and there is even the\npossibility that when a mother-in-law is unsympathetic, her own mother-in-law\nmay intervene on behalf of a grandson\'s wife. Before the grandmother,\ntherefore, there is none of that weight of reverence which can never be\nlightened in the mother\'s presence. Even the veil need not be dropped. The\nfamiliar "thou" takes the place of the stately "you," and there is no respect\nshown by frigid reserve.\n\nLong ago, when a child\'s solemn betrothal often took place at seven or eight\nyears of age, it was to gratify the old people\'s desire to have more children\nabout them that the tiny maidens were brought into the house. It was on the\ngrandmother\'s lap that the little ones were made acquainted; it was she and\nher husband who watched anxiously to see that they took to each other; and it\nwas they again who petted and comforted the minute grand-daughter-in-law in\nher hours of home sickness. Marriage has grown later nowadays, in answer\namongst other things to the pressure of an increasing poverty, and it does not\nhappen so often that an old man is seen in the bazaar buying consoling gifts\nfor the baby brides at home. But the same instinct still obtains, of making\nthe new home a place of choice, when between her twelfth and fourteenth year--\nthe girl\'s age at her first and second marriages--the young couple visit\nalternately in each other\'s families.\n\nThe Hindu theory is that a long vista of common memory adds sweetness even to\nthe marriage tie, and whether we think this true or not, we have all known\nhappy marriages on such a basis. But about the mutual sentiment of old and\nyoung there can be no theory, because there is no possibility of doubt. In all\ncountries in the world it is recognised\n\np. 33\n\nas amongst the happiest things in life. The reminiscence of Arjuna, one of the\nheroes of the great War-Epic, gives us the Indian explanation of this fact. "I\nclimbed on his knee," he says, speaking of the aged knight Bhishma, head of\nhis house, "all hot and dusty from my play, and flinging my arms about his\nneck, I called him \'Father.\'" "Nay, my child," he replied, as he held me to\nhis breast, "not thy _father_ but _thy father\'s father!_ " With each\ngeneration, that is to say, the tie has deepened and intensified.\n\nIn all cases where one or two hundred persons live under the same roof, a\ncomplex etiquette grows up, by which gradations of rank and deference are\nrigidly defined. Under the Hindu system this fund of observation has so\naccumulated that it amounts now to an accomplished culture--a completed\ncriticism of life--rich in quaint and delightful suggestions for humanity\neverywhere. We may not know why a mother\'s relatives are apt to be dearer than\na father\'s, but the statement will be approved as soon as made. It has not\noccurred to us that our relations to an elder sister and a younger are not the\nsame: in India there is a different word for each, for whole worlds of\nsweetness lie a world apart in one name and the other to the Hindu mind. Yet a\ncousin is constantly called brother or sister, the one relation being merged\nentirely in the other. The mere use of a language with this degree of\ndefiniteness implies an emotional training of extraordinary kind. It is, of\ncourse, best suited to natures of great richness of feeling. In these,\nsentiment is developed in proportion to expression, and the same attitude that\nmakes every one in the village "Aunt" or "Uncle" to the children, produces an\nultimate sense of kinship to the world. This is perhaps the commonest\ncharacteristic of Hindu men and women; shy at\n\np. 34\n\nfirst, and passive to slight stimulus, as are all great forces, when once a\nrelationship is established, they believe in it absolutely, blindly; are ready\nto go to the uttermost in its name; and forget entirely all distance of birth\nor difference of association. The weak point in the system appears when it has\nto deal with the harder, more arid class of natures. In these there is less\ninner response to the outer claim, expressions of difference, therefore,\nbecome less sincere and more abject. This is but a poor preparation for the\nopen air of the modern world, where seniority, sanctity, and rank have all to\nbe more or less ignored, and man stands face to face with man, free and equal\nso far as the innate manhood of each can carry. But such persons--though,\nnaturally enough, they cluster round the powerful foreigner as moths about a\nlamp--are the failures of Hinduism, not its types, and they are very few. In a\nperfected education, Western ideals of equality and struggle would present\nthemselves to these for their choosing, while far away in Europe, maybe,\nhearts born too sensitive for their more rudimentary emotional surroundings\nwould be thankful in turn to find life made richer by Indian conceptions of\nhuman relationship.\n\nIn a community like that of the Hindu home--as in all clan-systems--the\ncharacteristic virtue of every member must be a loyal recognition of common\nduties and dangers. And this is so. The wife who refused to share her\nhusband\'s obligation to a widowed sister and her children was never known in\nIndia. Times of stress draw all parts of the vast group together; none of the\nblood can cry in vain for protection and support: even a "village-connection"\n( _i.e._ , one who is kin by association only) finds refuge in his hour of\nneed. This great nexus of responsibility takes the place of workhouse,\nhospital, orphanage, and the rest. Here the lucky and the\n\np. 35\n\nunlucky are brought up side by side. For to the ripe and mellow genius of the\nEast it has been always clear that the defenceless and unfortunate require a\n_home_ , not a barrack.\n\nInto this complex destiny the bride enters finally, about her fourteenth year.\nTill now she has been a happy child, running about in freedom, feet shod and\nhead bare, eating and drinking what she would. Till now, life has been full of\nindulgences--for her own parents, with the shadow of this early separation\nhanging over them, have seen no reason for a severity that must bring in its\ntrain an undying regret. From the moment of her betrothal, however, the girl\'s\nexperience gradually changes. Just as the young nun, if she runs to find her\nthimble, will be sent back to bring it "more religiously," so about the newly\nmarried girl there grows a subtle atmosphere of recollectedness. The hair is\nparted, no longer childishly brushed back; and at the parting--showing just\nbeyond the border of the veil with which her head now is always covered--\nappears a touch of vermilion, put there this morning as she dressed in token\nthat she wished long life to her husband; much as one might, in taking up a\nfan, blow a kiss from its edge to some absent beloved one. The young wife\'s\nfeet are unshod, and the gold wedding bracelet on the left wrist, and a few\nornaments appropriate to her new dignity, supply the only hint of girlish\nvanity. But she has more jewels. These that she wears daily are of plain gold,\nmore or less richly worked, but on her wedding night she wore the _siti_ , or\nthree-lined coronal, set with gems, and arms and neck were gay with flashing\nstones. All these were her dower, given by her father to be her personal\nproperty, and not even her husband can touch them without her consent, though\nhe will add to them occasionally at festive moments. She will wear them all\nnow and\n\np. 36\n\nagain, on great occasions, but meanwhile the silver anklets and the golden\nnecklet and a few bangles are enough for daily use. The girl knows her right\nto her own ornaments quite well, and the world will never hear how often the\nwife or the mother has hastened to give up the whole of this little resource\nin order that son or husband might weather a storm or receive an education.\nThe one thing from which she will never part, however, unless widowhood lays\nits icy hand upon her life, is that ring of iron covered with gold and worn on\nthe left wrist, which is the sign of the indissoluble bond of her marriage--\nher wedding-ring in fact.\n\nWith all the shyness of the religious novice comes the girl to her new home.\nIts very form, with its pillared courtyards, is that of a cloister. The\nconstant dropping of the veil in the presence of a man, or before a senior, is\nthe token of a real retirement, the sacrament of an actual seclusion, within\nwhich all the voices of the world lose distinctness and individuality,\nbecoming but faint echoes of that which alone can call the soul and compel the\neager feet. For India has no fear of too much worship. To her, all that exists\nis but a mighty curtain of appearances, tremulous now and again with breaths\nfrom the unseen that it conceals. At any point, a pinprick may pierce the\ngreat illusion, and the seeker become aware of the Infinite Reality beyond.\nAnd who so fitted to be the window of the Eternal Presence as that husband,\nwho is at once most adored and loved of all created beings?\n\nFor there is a deep and general understanding of the fact that only in its own\nillumination, or its own feeling, can the soul find its highest individuation.\nTo learn how she can offer most becomes thus the aim of the young wife\'s\nstriving. All her dreams are of the saints--women mighty in renunciation:\nSita, whose love found its richest expression in the life-long\n\np. 37\n\nfarewell that made her husband the ideal king; Sati, who died rather than hear\na word against Siva, even from her own father; and Uma, realising that her\nlove was given in vain, yet pursuing the more eagerly the chosen path. "Be\nlike Savitri," was her father\'s blessing, as he bade her the bridal farewell,\nand Savitri--the Alcestris of Indian story--was that maiden who followed even\nDeath till she won back her husband\'s life. Thus wifehood is thought great in\nproportion to its giving, not to its receiving. It would never occur to any\none, in writing fiction, or delineating actual character, to praise a woman\'s\ncharms, as we praise Sarah Jennings\', on the score that she retained her\nhusband\'s affection during her whole life. A good man, says the Hindu, does\nnot fail his wife, but, apart from this, coquetry and vanity, however pleasing\nin their form, could never dignify marriage. Lifelong intimacy, to be\nbeautiful, must boast deeper foundations--the wife\'s love, daring all and\nasking for no return; the mother\'s gentleness, that never changes; the\nfriend\'s unswerving generosity. To the grave Oriental there is something\nindecorous in the discussion of the subject on any but this highest basis. And\nyet Persia, the France of Asia, must have been a perpetual influence towards\nromanticism in Hindu life. There is said to be no love poetry in the world so\nimpassioned as the Persian. The famous verse:\n\nFour eyes met. There were changes in two souls.  \nAnd now I cannot remember whether he is a man and I a woman,  \nOr he a woman and I a man. All I know is,  \nThere were two: Love came, and there is one. . .\n\nwe must believe completely representative of its spirit. * The Persian\nlanguage, however, has only\n\np. 38\n\ntouched India through the Court of Delhi and through letters. It has been the\npossession of the Indo-Mohammedan, and of any man here and there who took the\ntime and trouble to master its literature; but the world of Hindu womanhood\nhas remained probably as remote from it as though it belonged to another\nplanet.\n\nThis is not true to the same extent of the romantic aspect of Christianity.\nThe letters taught in English schools result very much in novel-reading, and\nan indigenous school of fiction has grown up, in the form of books and\nmagazines, which is likely to modify popular ideas on this subject profoundly.\nMeanwhile, and for long to come, it remains true that according to Hindu\nnotions, the eyes of bride and bridegroom are to be directed towards the\nwelfare of the family and not of themselves, as the basis of society: it is\nthe great springs of helpfulness and service, rather than those of mutual love\nand romantic happiness that marriage is expected to unloose. Selfish wives and\njealous husbands there must be, as among all peoples. But it is a fact,\nnevertheless, that here the absolute stainlessness of the wife is considered\nbut preliminary to the further virtue demanded of her, the sustaining of the\nhonour of her husband\'s house.\n\nWith this clue it becomes easy to understand even what the West considers to\nbe the anomalies of Hindu custom--the laws regarding rare cases of polygamy\nand adoption. For it is legally provided that if a woman remain childless her\nhusband may after seven years, _and with her permission_ , take a second wife,\nin the hope of gaining a son to succeed to his place. On the European basis of\nindividualism, the permission would probably be impossible to obtain; but with\nthe Eastern sense of family obligation, this has not always been so, and I\nhave\n\np. 39\n\nmyself met the son of such a marriage whose story was of peculiar interest.\nThe elder wife had insisted that the time was come for the alternative to be\ntried, and had herself chosen the speaker\'s mother as the most beautiful girl\nshe could find, for the husband. The marriage once over, she made every effort\nto make it a success, and welcomed the new wife as a younger sister. Not only\nthis, but when the son was born, such was her tenderness that he was twelve\nyears old before he knew that she was not his mother. After her death,\nhowever, the younger wife became head of the house. Amongst the children to be\nfed, there were degrees of kindred, certain adopted orphans, two or three\ncousins, and himself. He was the eldest of all, and protested loudly that he\ncame in last, and his cousins only second, for his mother\'s attentions. "Nay,\nmy child," she answered, with a Hindu woman\'s sweetness and good sense, "if I\ndesired to neglect thee, I could not do it. Is it not right, then, first to\nserve those who have no protection against me?"\n\nThe family life which such a story discloses is singularly noble, and it is\nnot necessary to suppose that polygamy entailed such generosities oftener than\nwe find monogamy do amongst ourselves. In any case, the same tide that brings\nin individualism has swept away this custom; and whereas it never was common\nit is now practically obsolete, except for princes and great nobles, and even\namongst these classes there are signs of a radical change of custom.\n\n"Where women are honoured, there the gods are pleased: where they are\ndishonoured, religious acts become of no avail." "In whatever family the\nhusband is contented with his wife, and the wife with her husband, in that\nhouse will good fortune assuredly abide." Few books offer such delights to\ntheir readers as that known as the "Laws of Manu."\n\np. 40\n\n[paragraph continues] It is in no sense a collection of Acts of Parliament,\nfor the one attitude throughout is that of the witness, and the hastiest\nperusal shows that it represents the growth of custom during ages, and is in\nno sense the work of a single hand. This is indeed its first and most striking\nbeauty. As must be, of course, it often happens that the superstition of a\nhabit is stated as gravely as its original intent, but rarely so as to obscure\nthat first significance, or leave it difficult of restoration, and from cover\nto cover the book throbs with the passion for justice, and the appreciation of\nfine shades of courtesy and taste, clothed in calm and judicial form.\nEspecially of this type are those dicta on the rights of women, which are\nhousehold words in Indian homes. We all know the reaction of the written word\non life. Fact once formulated as scripture acquires new emphasis, a certain\noccult significance seems to attach to it, and the words, "it is written"\nbecome terrible enough to affright the devil himself. In this way the fear of\na feminine curse has become a superstition in India, and I have seen even a\nlow-class mob fall back at the command of a single woman who opposed them. For\nis it not written in the book of the law that "the house which is cursed by a\nwoman perishes utterly, _as if destroyed by a sacrifice for the death of an\nenemy_ " _?_ \\--strange and graphic old phrase, pregnant of woe!\n\nIt is evident then that the laws of Manu are rather the unconscious expression\nof the spirit of the people than a declaration of the ideals towards which\nthey strive. And for this reason they would afford the most reliable\nfoundation for a healthy criticism of Indian custom. The conception of\ndomestic happiness which they reveal is very complete, and no one who has seen\nthe light on an Indian woman\'s face when it turns to her husband--as I have\nseen it in all parts of the country--can doubt that that conception is often\nrealised in life. For if the\n\np. 41\n\ncharacteristic emotion of the wife may be described as passionate reverence,\nthat of the Hindu husband is certainly a measureless protection. If we may\npresume to analyse things so sacred as the great mutual trusts of life, it\nwould seem that tenderness is the ruling note of the man\'s relation. Turning\nas he does to the memory of his own mother for the ideal perfection, there is\nagain something of motherhood in what he brings to his wife. As a child might\ndo, she cooks for him, and serves him, sitting before him as he eats to fan\naway the flies. As a disciple might, she prostrates herself before him,\ntouching his feet with her head before receiving his blessing. It is not\nequality. No. But who talks of a vulgar equality, asks the Hindu wife, when\nshe may have instead the unspeakable blessedness of offering worship?\n\nAnd on the man\'s side, how is this received? Entirely without personal vanity.\nThe idea that adoration is the soul\'s opportunity has sunk deep into the life\nof the people. And the husband can recognise his wife\'s right to realise her\nhighest through him without ever forgetting that it is her power to love, not\nhis worthiness of love, that is being displayed. Indeed, is not life\neverywhere of one tint in this regard? Does anything stir our reverence like\nan affection that we feel beyond our merit?\n\nIt is often glibly said that this habit of being served spoils the Indian man\nand renders him careless of the comfort of others. I have never found this to\nbe so. It is true that Indian men do not rise when a woman enters, and remain\nstanding till she is seated. Nor do they hasten to open the door through which\nshe is about to pass. But then it is not according to the etiquette of their\ncountry to do these things. With regard to the last point, indeed, their idea\nis that man should precede woman,\n\np. 42\n\nmaintaining the tradition of the path-breaker in the jungle; and one of the\nmost touching incidents in the national epic of heroic love is Sita\'s request\nto go first along the forest paths, in order to sweep the thorns from her\nhusband\'s path with the end of her veil. Needless to say, such a paradox is\nnot permitted.\n\nThus, honour for the weaker is expressed in one way in England and quite\notherwise in Hindostan, but the heart of conduct is the same in both\ncountries. The courtesy of husbands to their wives is quite unfailing amongst\nHindus. "Thou shalt not strike a woman, even with a flower," is the proverb.\nHis wife\'s desire for companionship on a journey is the first claim on a man.\nAnd it is very touching to notice how, as years go on, he leans more and more\nto the habit of addressing her as "O thou, mother of our son!" and presenting\nher to new corners as "my children\'s mother," thus reflecting upon her his\nworship of motherhood. In early manhood he trusts to her advice to moderate\nthe folly of his own rasher inclinations; in old age he becomes, as everywhere\nin the world, more entirely the eldest of her bairns, and she more and more\nthe real head and centre of the home. But always she remains as she was at the\nbeginning, Lakshmi, her husband\'s Goddess of Fortune. In those first days he\nate from no hand but his mother\'s or hers; and one of her devotions was the\nfast, not broken till he had eaten and their talk was over, though her evening\nmeal might in this way be delayed till long past midnight. Now, with the\nresponsibilities of her household upon her, she feeds a whole multitude before\nshe takes her own turn, and still the mutual pact of soul and soul has not\nbeen broken by the strife of "rights." These two have all these years been\neach other\'s refuge against the world. And not once have they felt so\nseparated as to offer thanks, or speak, either of the\n\np. 43\n\nother, by name, as if head and hand could be different individuals!\n\nOn that first bridal evening, the little bride was borne before her young\nhusband, and they were told that the moment was auspicious for their first shy\nlook. Then the old Vedic fire was called to witness their rites of union; the\ngirl flung the garland of flowers about the neck of her bridegroom, in\nexquisite symbolism of the bond that was to hold them; and finally they took\nseven steps together, hand in hand, while the priest chanted appropriate texts\nfor each stage of life. Such was their wedding. Since then, the rights of one\nhave been the rights of the other; joys, griefs, and duties have been held in\ncommon. Till now, if the bride of that distant night be entirely fortunate,\nthe prayer of her childhood is fulfilled to her in the end of her days, that\nprayer that said:\n\nFrom the arms of husband and sons,  \nWhen the Ganges is full of water,  \nMay I pass to the feet of the Lord.\n\nIt has seemed to me in watching Hindu couples that they were singular in the\nfrequent attainment of a perfect intimacy. To what is this due? Is it the\nearly association, or the fact that courtship comes after marriage, not\nbefore? Or is it the intense discipline of absolute reserve in the presence of\nothers? The people themselves, where their attention is called to it,\nattribute the fact to child-marriage. I remember asking a friend of my own, a\nman of wealth and cultivation, orthodox and childless, "If you could put away\npersonal considerations, and speak only from the outside, which do you think\nbetter in the abstract, our marriage-system or yours?"\n\nHe paused, and answered slowly, "I think--ours; for I cannot conceive that two\npeople could grow\n\np. 44\n\ninto each other, as my wife and I have done, under any other."\n\nAmongst the luxuries of the West I have sometimes thought that the deepening\nof the human tie was proportionate to simplicity of surroundings. A people to\nwhom all complexity of externals is impossible must live by thought and\nfeeling, or perish in the wilderness.\n\nBut whatever be the truth on this point, I have seen clearly and constantly\nthat the master-note by which the Hindu woman\'s life can be understood in the\nWest is that of the religious life. This is so, even with the wife. Cloistered\nand veiled, she devotes herself to one name, one thought, yet is never known\nto betray the fact, even as the nun steals away in secret to kneel before the\nBlessed Sacrament. The ideal that she, like the nun, pursues, is that of a\nvision which merges the finite in the infinite, making strong to mock at\nseparation, or even at change. And the point to be reached in practice is that\nwhere the whole world is made beautiful by the presence in it of the beloved,\nwhere the hungry are fed, and the needy relieved, out of a joyful recognition\nthat they wear a common humanity with his; and where, above all, the sense of\nunrest and dissatisfaction is gone for ever, in the overflowing fulness of a\nlove that asks no return except the power of more abundant loving.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[37:*](wil05.htm#fr_0) This verse is actually old Bengali, of the sixteenth\ncentury.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV.
