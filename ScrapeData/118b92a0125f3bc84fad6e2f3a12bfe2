It will place before our\neyes the transformation which mere repetition, conversation, or what is called\noral tradition will and must produce in the description of the facts as they\nreally happened. We can watch here what is really a kind of Dialectic Process\nwhich is at work in all history, both ancient and modern. This Dialectic\nProcess as applied to the facts of history comprehends all the changes which\nare inevitably produced by the mere communication and interchange of ideas, by\nthe give and take of dialogue, by the turning of thoughts from one side to the\nother. It is in reality what is called in German the threshing out of a\nsubject, a kind of _Durchsprechen_ , or what the Greeks called a speaking\nforward and backward, or dialogue. Even Hegel's Dialectic Process, the\nmovement of the idea by itself, that leads irresistibly from positive to\nnegative and to conciliation, has its origin in what I should prefer to call\nby a wider name the _Dialogic Process_ , of the greatest importance in\nhistory, both ancient and modern. There is hardly a single fact in history\nwhich can escape being modified by this process before it reaches the writer\nof history. It must be distinguished from the _Mythological Process_ , which\nforms indeed a part of it, but acts under much more special rules. We can\nwatch the Dialogic Process in Modern History also, though we have here\nreporters, and newspapers, the autobiographies and reminiscences\n\np. 26\n\nof great statesmen which would seem to render this Dialogic infection\nimpossible or harmless. We can only guess what it must have been in times when\nneither shorthand nor printing existed, when writing and reading were the\nprivilege of a small class, and when very often two or three generations had\npassed away before the idea of recording certain facts and certain sayings\noccurred to a chronicler or a historiographer. It is extraordinary that so\nmany historians should have completely neglected this Dialogic Process through\nwhich everything must pass before it reaches even the first recorder,\nforgetting that it could never have been absent. How many difficulties would\nhave been solved, how many contradictions explained, nay how many miracles\nwould become perfectly natural and intelligible, if historians would only\nlearn this one lesson, that we do not and cannot know of any historical event\nthat has not previously passed through this Dialogic Process.\n\nLet us take so recent an event as the telegram sent from Ems, where I am\nwriting. It was meant to tell the world of the supposed insult which Benedetti\nhad offered to the King of Prussia. That telegram marks one of the most\ndecisive events in modern history, it has really helped to change the whole\nface of Europe. What do we know of it, even after Bismarck's own confessions,\nbeyond what he thought and spoke in his own mind, beyond what he said to my\nfriend Abeken, who wrote it out and sent it off, beyond what the people in\nGermany and in France thought of it, said of it, made of it, whether as\njustifying or condemning the war that sprang out of it. Shall we ever know the\n_ipsissima verba_  \n\np. 27\n\nof Benedetti, his tone of voice, the tone of voice in the Emperor's reply, the\nconsternation or chuckle when the iron chancellor heard from all parts of\nEurope the echo of his own words and thoughts. And yet all this happened but\nyesterday. Benedetti himself has told us what he actually said, what the\nEmperor replied; Bismarck himself has told us what he meant when he had the\ncooked telegram published to all the world. Does the historian know then what\nreally happened, what was intended by the words used by Benedetti, by the\nEmperor, and by Bismarck? Here in Ems the very spot is shown where the words\nwere spoken, though opinions vary even on this point. We possess now the\nversion given by the French diplomatist which is totally different from that\ngiven by Bismarck, and yet they had passed through one Dialogic Process only,\nthat of the old King in his conversation with Benedetti and in his\ncommunications with his ministers. Again, every reader of modern history is\nacquainted with the words put into the mouth of the French officer at\nWaterloo, _La guarde meurt, mais ne se rend pas_ ; and every reader of French\nMemoirs knows by this time the real word which is said to have been uttered at\nthat historical moment. How can we ever hope to escape from the transforming\npower of oral tradition?\n\nThe changes wrought by that power are of course more or less violent according\nto circumstances; entirely absent, I believe, they never are. And nowhere are\nthey more evident than in the accounts which have reached us of the founding\nof new religions and of their founders. In\n\np. 28\n\nthe case of Buddhism, it is well known that some excellent scholars have\nactually denied that there ever was such a person as the young prince of\nKapilavastu, of whose life and doings and sayings we possess fuller accounts\nthan of the founders of any other religion. And let it be remembered that no\nrevealed or miraculous character is claimed for Buddha's biographies, nay that\nBuddha himself rejected any such exceptional claims for himself and for his\napostles, being satisfied with having been a man on earth, which, according to\nhim, is the highest form of being in the world, potentially, and is, even in\nreality, high above all angels and above all gods (devas), such as they were\nin his time. Atideva, above all gods, is one of the names assigned to Buddha,\nshowing the estimation in which Buddha and in which the gods were held by\ntheir followers.\n\nThis inevitable influence of the Dialogic Process in history cannot be\nrecognised too soon. It will remove endless difficulties by which we are\nensnared, endless dishonesties in which we have ensnared ourselves. If we once\nunderstand that after only one day, one week, one year any communication, even\na communication given from heaven, must suffer the consequences of this\nDialogic Process, must be infected by the breath of human thought and of human\nweakness, many a self-made difficulty will vanish, many a story distorted by\nthe childish love of the miraculous will regain its true moral character, many\na face disguised by a misplaced apotheosis will look upon us again with his\ntruly human, loving, and divine eyes. All honest hearts, whatever religion\nthey may profess, will feel relieved and\n\np. 29\n\ngrateful if they once thoroughly understand the dialectic or dialogic working\nof oral tradition, particularly where it can be traced back to pure and\nperfectly natural sources.\n\nIt is for this very reason, and because this process can be so seldom watched,\nbut can generally be traced in its later results only, that even this slight\nsketch of what a disciple of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, with every wish to be\ntruthful, can tell us of his master, may be of some interest to ourselves both\nfor its own sake and for the light which it throws on the conditions under\nwhich every religion has to grow up and to be recorded. Nothing is so human as\nreligion, nothing so much exposed to the frailties inherent in human nature.\nWhatever the origin of a religion may be supposed to have been, its growth\nfrom the very first depends clearly on the recipient soil, that is, on human\nnature, and to study that human nature as it reacts on religion is one of the\nmost useful lessons of Comparative Theology.\n\nI had made it as clear as possible to Vivekananda that the accounts hitherto\npublished of his Master, however edifying they might be to his followers,\nwould sound perfectly absurd to European students, that stories of miraculous\nevents in childhood, of apparitions of goddesses (devi) communicating to the\nSa _m_ nyasin a knowledge of languages and literatures which, as we know, he\nnever possessed in real life, would simply be thrown away on us poor\nunbelievers, and that descriptions of miracles performed by the Saint, however\nwell authenticated, ''would produce the very opposite effect of what they were\nintended for. Vivekananda himself is a man who knows\n\np. 30\n\n[paragraph continues] England and America well, and perfectly understood what\nI meant. Yet even his unvarnished description of his Master discloses here and\nthere the clear traces of what I call the Dialogic Process, and the\nirrepressible miraculising tendencies of devoted disciples. And I am really\nglad that it does so, if only it helps to teach us that no historian can ever\npretend to do more than to show us what a man or a fact seemed to be to him or\nto the authorities whom he has to follow, and not what he or it actually was.\nI have also, as far as I could, consulted another account of the life of Ramak\n_ri_ sh _n_ a published in the late numbers of the Brahmavadin. But I am sorry\nto say that this account stops with No. 19, and has not been continued.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a's Life](rls14.htm)\n\n"
