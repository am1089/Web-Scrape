But the declarations are equal.\n\nThe argument that knowledge must be held subordinate to work because we learn\nfrom Scripture that those who know Brahman perform sacrificial works, will not\nhold good; since, on the other hand, we also see that men knowing Brahman\nabandoned all work; cp. texts such as 'The _Ri_ shis descended from Kavasha\nsaid: For what purpose should we study the Veda? for what purpose should we\nsacrifice?' As it thus appears that those who know Brahman give up works,\nknowledge cannot be a mere auxiliary to works.--But how can it be accounted\nfor that those who know Brahman both do and do not perform works?--Works may\nbe performed in so far as sacrifices and the like, if performed by one not\nhaving any special wish, stand in subordinate relation to the knowledge of\nBrahman; hence there is no objection to texts enjoining works. And as, on the\nother hand, sacrifices and such-like works when aiming at results of their own\nare opposed to the knowledge of Brahman which has Release for its only result,\nthere is all the less objection to texts which suggest the non-performance of\nworks. If, on the other hand, knowledge were subordinate to works, works could\non no account be dispensed with.--Against the assertion that\n\np. 691\n\nScripture directly declares knowledge to be subordinate to works the next\nSutra declares itself.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 10.
