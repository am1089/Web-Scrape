He took the proffered seat,  \nAnd as she pressed her son to eat,  \nRaised reverent bands, and, touched with shame,  \nMade answer to the royal dame:  \n\n  "Dear lady, thou hast yet to know  \nThat danger threats, and heavy woe:  \nA grief that will with sore distress  \nOn Sita, thee, and Lakshman press.  \nWhat need of seats have such as I?  \nThis day to Dandak wood I fly.  \nThe hour is come, a time, unmeet  \nFor silken couch and gilded seat.  \nI must to lonely wilds repair,  \nAbstain from flesh, and living there  \nOn roots, fruit, honey, hermit\'s food,  \nPass twice seven years in solitude.  \nTo Bharat\'s hand the king will yield  \nThe regent power I thought to wield,  \nAnd me, a hermit, will he send  \nMy days in Dandak wood to spend."  \n\nAs when the woodman\'s axe has lopped  \nA S\'al branch in the grove, she dropped:  \nSo from the skies a Goddess falls  \nEjected from her radiant halls.  \n\nWhen Rama saw her lying low,  \nProstrate by too severe a blow,  \nAround her form his arms he wound  \nAnd raised her fainting from the ground.  \nHis hand upheld her like a mare  \nWho feels her load too sore to bear,  \nAnd sinks upon the way o\'ertoiled,  \nAnd all her limbs with dust are soiled.  \nHe soothed her in her wild distress  \nWith loving touch and soft caress.  \nShe, meet for highest fortune, eyed  \nThe hero watching by her side,  \nAnd thus, while Lakshman bent to hear,  \nAddressed her son with many a tear:  \n"If, Rama, thou had ne\'er been born  \nMy child to make thy mother mourn,  \nThough reft of joy, a childless queen,  \nSuch woe as this I ne\'er had seen.  \nThough to the childless wife there clings  \nOne sorrow armed with keenest stings,  \n\'No child have I: no child have I,\'  \nNo second misery prompts the sigh.  \nWhen long I sought, alas, in vain,  \nMy husband\'s love and bliss to gain,  \nIn Rama all my hopes I set  \nAnd dreamed I might be happy yet.  \nI, of the consorts first and best,  \nMust bear my rivals\' taunt and jest,  \nAnd brook, though better far than they,  \nThe soul distressing words they say.  \nWhat woman can be doomed to pine  \nIn misery more sore than mine,  \nWhose hopeless days must still be spent  \nIn grief that ends not and lament?  \nThey scorned me when my son was nigh;  \nWhen he is banished I must die.  \nMe, whom my husband never prized,  \nKaikeyi\'s retinue despised  \nWith boundless insolence, though she  \nTops not in rank nor equals me.  \nAnd they who do me service yet,  \nNor old allegiance quite forget,  \nWhene\'er they see Kaikeyi\'s son,  \nWith silent lips my glances shun.  \nHow, O my darling, shall I brook  \nEach menace of Kaikeyi\'s look,  \nAnd listen, in my low estate,  \nTo taunts of one so passionate?  \nFor seventeen years since thou wast born  \nI sat and watched, ah me, forlorn!  \nHoping some blessed day to see  \nDeliverance from my woes by thee.  \nNow comes this endless grief and wrong,  \nSo dire I cannot bear it long,  \nSinking, with age and sorrow worn.  \nBeneath my rivals\' taunts and scorn.  \nHow shall I pass in dark distress  \nMy long lone days of wretchedness  \nWithout my Rama\'s face, as bright  \nAs the full moon to cheer my sight?  \nAlas, my cares thy steps to train,  \nAnd fasts, and vows, and prayers are vain.  \nHard, hard, I ween, must be this heart  \nTo hear this blow nor burst apart,  \nAs some great river bank, when first  \nThe floods of Rain-time on it burst.  \n   No, Fate that speeds not will not slay,  \n     Nor Yama\'s halls vouchsafe me room,  \n   Or, like a lion\'s weeping prey,  \n     Death now had borne me to my doom.  \n   Hard is my heart and wrought of steel  \n     That breaks not with the crushing blow,  \n   Or in the pangs this day I feel  \n     My lifeless frame had sunk below.  \n   Death waits his hour, nor takes me now:  \n     But this sad thought augments my pain,  \n   That prayer and largess, fast and vow,  \n      And Heavenward service are in vain.  \n    Ah me, ah me! with fruitless toil  \n      Of rites austere a child I sought:  \n    Thus seed cast forth on barren soil  \n      Still lifeless lies and comes to naught.  \n    If ever wretch by anguish grieved  \n      Before his hour to death had fled,  \n    I mourning, like a cow bereaved,  \n      Had been this day among the dead."  \n\np. 118  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[116:1](ry098.htm#fr_287) The comparison may to a European reader seem a\nhomely one. But Spenser likens an infuriate woman to a cow \'That is berobbed\nof her youngling dere.\' Shakspeare also makes King Henry VI. compare himself\nto the calf\'s mother that \'Runs lowing up and down, Looking the way her\nharmless young one went.\' \'Cows,\' says De Quincey, \'are amongst the gentlest\nof breathing creatures; none show more passionate tenderness to their young,\nwhen deprived of them, and, in short, I am not ashamed to profess a deep love\nfor these gentle creatures.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXI.: Kaus\'alya Calmed.](ry099.htm)\n\n'
