do not grieve  \nFor our dear home and all we leave.  \nThe woods unpeopled seem to weep  \nAround us, as their tenants creep  \nOr fly to lair and den and nest,  \nBoth bird and beast, to seek their rest.  \nMethinks Ayodhya's royal town  \nWhere dwells my sire of high renown,  \nWith all her men and dames to-night  \nWill mourn us vanished from their sight.  \nFor, by his virtues won, they cling  \nIn fond affection to their king,  \nAnd thee and me, O brave and true,  \nAnd Bharat and S'atrughna too.  \nI for my sire and mother feel  \nDeep sorrow o'er my bosom steal,  \nLest mourning us, oppressed with fears,  \nThey blind their eyes with endless tears.  \nYet Bharat's duteous love will show  \nSweet comfort in their hours of woe,  \nAnd with kind words their hearts sustain,  \nSuggesting duty, bliss, and gain.  \nI mourn my parents now no more:  \nI count dear Bharat's virtues o'er,  \nAnd his kind love and care dispel  \nThe doubts I had, and all is well.  \nAnd thou thy duty wouldst not shun,  \nAnd, following me, hast nobly done;  \nElse, bravest, I should need a band  \nAround my wife as guard to stand.  \nOn this first night, my thirst to slake,  \nSome water only will I take:  \nThus, brother, thus my will decides,  \nThough varied store the wood provides.'  \n\nThus having said to Lakshman, he  \nAddressed in turn Sumantra: 'Be  \nMost diligent to-night, my friend,  \nAnd with due care thy horses tend.'  \nThe sun had set: Sumantra tied  \nHis noble horses side by side,  \nGave store of grass with liberal hand,  \nAnd rested near them on the strand.  \nEach paid the holy evening rite,  \nAnd when around them fell the night,  \nThe charioteer, with Lakshman's aid,  \nA lowly bed for Rama laid.  \nTo Lakshman Rama bade adieu,  \nAnd then by, Sita's side he threw  \nHis limbs upon the leafy bed  \nTheir care upon the bank had spread.  \nWhen Lakshman saw the couple slept,  \nStill on the strand his watch he kept,  \nStill with Sumantra there conversed,  \nAnd Rama's varied gifts rehearsed.  \nAll night he watched, nor sought repose,  \nTill on the earth the sun arose:  \nWith him Sumantra stayed awake,  \nAnd still of Rama's virtues spake.  \nThus, near the river's grassy shore  \nWhich herds unnumbered wandered o'er,  \nRepose, untroubled, Rama found,  \nAnd all the people lay around.  \nThe glorious hero left his bed,  \nLooked on the sleeping crowd, and said  \nTo Lakshman, whom each lucky line  \nMarked out for bliss with surest sign:  \n'O brother Lakshman, look on these  \nReclining at the roots of trees;  \nAll care of house and home resigned,  \nCaring for us with heart and mind,  \nThese people of the city yearn  \n\np. 149  \n\nTo see us to our home return:  \nTo quit their lives will they consent,  \nBut never leave their firm intent.  \nCome, while they all unconscious sleep,  \nLet us upon the chariot leap,  \nAnd swiftly on our journey speed  \nWhere naught our progress may impede,  \nThat these fond citizens who roam  \nFar from Ikshvaku's ancient home,  \nNo more may sleep 'neath bush and tree,  \nFollowing still for love of me.  \nA prince with tender care should heal  \nThe self-brought woes his people feel,  \nAnd never let his subjects share  \nThe burthen he is forced to bear.'  \n   Then Lakshman to the chief replied,  \nWho stood like Justice by his side:  \n'Thy rede, O sage, I well commend:  \nWithout delay the car ascend.'  \nThen Rama to Sumantra spoke:  \n'Thy rapid steeds, I pray thee, yoke.  \nHence to the forest will I go:  \nAway, my lord, and be not slow.'  \n   Sumantra, urged to utmost speed,  \nYoked to the car each generous steed,  \nAnd then, with hand to hand applied,  \nHe came before the chief and cred:  \n'Hail, Prince, whom mighty arms adorn,  \nHail, bravest of the chariot-borne!  \nWith Sita and thy brother thou  \nMayst mount: the car is ready now.'  \n   The hero clomb the car with haste:  \nHis bow and gear within were placed,  \nAnd quick the eddying flood he passed  \nOf Tamasa whose waves run fast.  \nSoon as he touched the farther side.  \nThat strong-armed hero, glorified,  \nHe found a road both wide and clear,  \nWhere e'en the timid naught could fear.  \nThen, that the crowd might be misled,  \nThus Rama to Sumantra said:  \n'Speed north a while, then hasten back,  \nReturning in thy former track,  \nThat so the people may not learn  \nThe course I follow: drive and turn.'  \n   Sumantra, at the chief's behest.  \nQuick to the task himself addressed;  \nThen near to Rama came, and showed  \nThe chariot ready for the road.  \nWith Sita, then, the princely two,  \nWho o'er the line of Raghu threw  \nA glory ever bright and new,  \n   Upon the chariot stood.  \nSumantra fast and faster drove  \nHis horses, who in fleetness strove  \nStill onward to the distant grove,  \n   The hermit-haunted wood.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLVII.: The Citizens' Return.](ry125.htm)\n\n"
