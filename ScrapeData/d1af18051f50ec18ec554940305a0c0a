In the case of (a devout meditation) common (to several _S_ akhas) (the\nparticulars mentioned in each _S_ akha) have to be combined, since there is no\ndifference of essential matter; just as in the case of what is complementary\nto injunctions.\n\n[This Sutra states the practical outcome of the discussion carried on in the\nfirst four Sutras.] It having been determined that the cognitions of Brahman\nare equally intimated by all Vedanta-texts, it follows that as long as the\ncognition is one and the same its specific determinations mentioned in one\ntext are to be introduced into other texts also where they are not mentioned.\nFor if the matter of these determinations subserves some particular cognition\nin one place, it subserves it in another place also, since in both places we\nhave to do with one and the same cognition. The case is analogous to that of\nthe things subordinate to some sacrificial performance, as, e g. the\nagnihotra. The agnihotra also is one performance, and therefore its\nsubordinate members, although they may be mentioned in different texts, have\nto be combined into one whole.--If the\n\np. 192\n\ncognitions were separate, the particulars mentioned in different texts could\nnot be combined; for they would be confined each to its own cognition and\nwould not stand to each other in that relation in which the typical form of a\nsacrifice stands to its modifications 1. But as the cognitions are one, things\nlie differently--The above Sutra will be explained and applied at length\nfurther on, in Sutra 10 ff.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[192:1](sbe38148.htm#fr_128) The Purva Mima _m_ sa teaches that all\nsubordinate things which the Veda prescribes for some typical sacrifice are eo\nipso prescribed for the modified forms of the sacrifice also.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 6](sbe38149.htm)\n\n'
