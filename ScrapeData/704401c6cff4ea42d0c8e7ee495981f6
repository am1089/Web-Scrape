To a Chief, or great man\nin India, it is still the most natural precaution he can take against poison,\nto eat only what has been prepared by his wife or daughter, or under their eye\nin his own zenana; and there are few accomplishments on which an Indian\nPrincess prides herself more than on her skill in cookery.\n\nRAMA AND LUXMAN.\n\nThe little black and white owls, which fly out at dusk and Sit always in\npairs, chattering to each other, in a singularly conversational version of owl\nlanguage, are among the most widely-spread of Indian birds, and in every\nprovince where they are found are regarded as the most accomplished of\nsoothsayers. Unlike other ominous creatures, they are anxious to do good to\nmankind, for they always tell each other what the traveller ought to do, and\nif mankind were not so dull in understanding their language, would save the\nhearer from all risk of misfortune.\n\n\n\nLITTLE SURYA BAI\n\nThe _sang-froit_ with which the first Ranee, here and in the story of\nPanch.Phul Ranee,receives the second and more favoured wife to share her\nthrone, however difficult to understand in the West, is very characteristic of\nOriental life. In Indian households of the highest rank, it would not be\ndifficult to find examples of several wives living amicably together as\ndescribed in some of these stories; but the contrary result, as depicted in\nthis story of Surya Bai and others, is far more common, for as a general rule\nhuman nature is too strong for custom, and under an external serenity bitter\njealousies exist between the several wives of a royal Hindoo household, which\nare a constant souroe of misery and crime. Among the curious changes of\nopinion which are observable of late years in our Indian Empire, none is more\nremarkable than the Conviction, now frequently expressed by the warmest\nsupporters of native governments at native courts, that the toleration of\npolygamy is one of their most serious dangers, the removal of which is of\nvital importance to the safety of any Indian dynasty, and, indeed, to the\npermanence of any Indian family of rank.\n\n\n\nTHE WANDERINGS OF VICRAM MAHARAJAH.\n\nThe Dipmal or Tower of Lights is an essential feature in every large Hindoo\ntemple. It is often of great height, and furnished with niches or brackets,\neach of which holds a lamp on festivals, especially on that of the Dewali, the\nfeast of lamps celebrated in the autumn in honour of the Hindoo goddess Bowani\nor Kali, who was formerly propitiated on that occasion by human sacrifices.\n\nThe story of Vicram's act of devotion is thoroughly Hindoo. It is difficult\nfor any European to understand the universal prevalence and strength of the\nconviction among Hindoos that the particular god of their adoration can be\nprevailed on, by importunity or self-devotion, to reveal to his worshipper\nsome act, generally ascetic or sacrificial, the performance of which will\ninsure to the devotee the realisation of the object of his wishes. The act of\ndevotion, and the object of the devotee, are both often very trivial; but,\noccasionally, we are startled by hearing of some deed of horror, a human\nsacrifice or deliberate act of self-immolation, which is quite unaccountable\nto those who are not aware that it is only a somewhat extreme manifestation of\na belief which still influences the daily conduct of the great majority of our\nHindoo fellow-subjects.\n\nAnd even Europeans, who have known the Hindoos long and intimately, frequently\nfail to recognise the extent to which this belief influences the ethics of\ncommon life and action in India. To quote an instance from well-known history:\nthere are few acts regarding which a European traveller would expect the\nverdict of all mankind to be more generally condemnatory than the murder of\nAfzul Khan, the general of the Imperial Delhi Army, by Sivajee, the founder of\nthe Mahratta Empire. Sivajee, according to the well-known story, had invited\nhis victim to an amicable conference, and there stabbed him with a wag nuck  1\nas they embraced at their first meeting. It was a deed of such deliberate and\ncruel treachery, that it could find few defenders in Europe even among the\nwildest advocates of political assassination. A European is consequently\nlittle prepared to find it regarded by Mahrattas generally as a most\ncommendable act of devotion. The Hindoo conscience condemns murder and\ntreachery as emphatically as the European; but this act, as viewed by the old-\nfashioned Mahratta, was a sacrifice prescribed by direct revelation of the\nterrible goddess Bowani to her faithful devotee. It was, therefore, highly\nmeritorious, and the beautiful Genoese blade which Sivajee always wore, and\nwith which his victim wns finally despatched, was, down to our own days,\nprovided with a little temple of its own in the palace of his descendants, and\nannually worshipped by them and their household--not as a mere act of\nveneration for their ancestor's trusty sword, but because it was the chosen\ninstrument of a great sacrifice, and, 'no doubt,' as the attendant who watched\nit used to say, 'some of the spirit of Bowani,' whose name it bore, 'must\nstill reside in it.'\n\nAn attentive observer will notice in the daily life of those around him in\nIndia constant instances of this belief in the efficacy of acts of devotion\nand sacrifice to alter even the decrees of Fate. It is one of the many\nincentives to the long pilgrimages which form such a universal feature in\nHindoo life, and the records of our courts of justice, and our Indian\nnewspapers, constantly afford traces of its prevalence in cases of attempted\nsuttee and other acts of self-immolation, or even of human sacrifice, like\nthat above alluded to. It must be remembered that Hindoo sacrifice has nothing\nbut the name in common with the sacrifices which are a distinctive part of the\nreligion of every Semitic race. Many a difficulty which besets the Hindoo\ninquirer after truth would be avoided if his essential distinction were always\nknown or remembered.\n\nThis belief in the omnipotence of 'Muntrs,' or certain verbal formulas,\nproperly pronounced by one to whom they have been authoritatively\ncommunicated, is closely allied to, and quite as universal as, the belief in\nthe efficacy of sacrificial acts of devotion. In every nation throughout\nIndia, whatever may be the variations of creed or caste usage, it is a general\narticle of belief accepted by the vast majority of every class and caste of\nHindoos, that there is a form of words (or Muntr), which, to be efficacious,\ncan be only orally transmitted, but which, when so communicated by one of the\n'twice born,' has absolutely unlimited power over all things, visible or\ninvisible, extending even to compelling the obedience of the gods, and of Fate\nitself. Of course it is rather dangerous, even for the wisest, to meddle with\nsuch potent influences, and the attempt is usually confined to the affairs of\ncommon life, but of the absolute omnipotence of 'Muntrs,' few ordinary un-\nEuropeanised Hindoos entertain any doubt, and there is hardly any part of\ntheir belief which exercises such an all-pervading and potent influence in\ntheir daily life, though that influence is often but little understood by\nEuropeans.\n\nThe classical reader will remember many allusions to a similar belief as a\npart of the creeds imported from the East which were fashionable under the\nEmpire at Rome, There is much curious information on the subject of the\nearliest known Hindoo Muntrs in the 'Aitareya Brahmana' of the learned Dr.\nHaug, the only European who ever witnessed the whole process of a Hindoo\nsacrifice. The English reader who is curious on such matters will do well to\nconsult the recently published work of Professor Max Muller, which might,\nwithout exaggeration, be described as a storehouse of new facts connected with\nthe religion and literature of the East, rather than by its modest title of\n_Chips from a German Workshop_.\n\nHOW THE SUN, THE MOON, AND THE WIND WENT OUT TO\n\nDINNER\n\nI have not ventured to alter the traditional mode of the Moon's conveyance of\ndinner to her mother the Star, though it must, I fear, seriously impair the\nvalue of the story as a moral lesson in the eyes of all instructors of youth.\n(M. F.)\n\n\n\nSINGH RAJAH AND THE CUNNING LITTLE JACKALS.\n\nThis story is substantially the same as one well known to readers of Pilpail's\nFables. The chorus of the Jackal's song of triumph is an imitation of their\nnocturnal bowl.\n\nTHE JACKAL, THE BARBER, AND THE BRAHMAN.\n\nThe touch of the poor outcast Mahars would be pollution to a Hindoo of any but\nthe lowest caste; hence their ready obedience to the Jackal's exhortation not\nto touch him.\n\nThe offerings of rice, flowers, a chicken, etc., and the pouring water over\nthe idol, are parts of the regular daily observance in every village temple.\n\nMUCHIE-LAL.\n\nThe popular belief in stories of this kind, where the Cobra becomes the\ncompanion of human beings, is greatly strengthened by the instances which\noccasionally occur when particular persons, sometimes children or idiots,\npossess the power to handle the deadly reptiles without receiving any injury\nfrom them. How much is due merely to gentleness of touch and fearlessness, and\nhow much to any personal peculiarity which pleases the senses of the snake, it\nis difficult to say, for the instances, though not few, and perfectly well\nauthenticated, are sufficiently rare to be popularly regarded as miraculous.\n\nIn one case, which occurred in the country west of Poona, not long after our\nconquest of the Deccan, a Brahman boy could, without the aid of music or\nanything but his own voice, attract to himself and handle with impunity all\nthe snakes which might be within hearing in any thicket or dry Stone wall,\nsuch as in that country is their favourite refuge. So great was the popular\nexcitement regarding him, under the belief that he was an incarnation of some\ndivinity, that the magistrate of Poona took note of his proceedings, and\nbecoming uneasy as to the political turn the excitement regarding the boy\nmight take, reported regularly to Government the growth of the crowds who\npressed to see the marvel, and to offer gifts to the child and his parents I\nThe poor boy, however, was at last bitten by one of the reptiles and died, and\nthe wonder ceased.\n\nCHUNDUN RAJAH.\n\nThere are innumerable popular superstitions regarding the powers which can be\nconveyed in a charmed necklace; and it is a common belief that good and bad\nfortune, and life itself, can be made to depend on its not being removed from\nthe wearer's neck.\n\nCHANDRA'S VENGEANCE.\n\nThe picture of the childless wife setting forth to seek Mahadeo, and resolving\nnot to return till she has seen him, is one which would find a parallel in\nsome of the persons composing almost every group of pilgrims who resort to the\ngreat shrines of Hindostan. Any one who has an opportunity of quietly\nquestioning the members of such an assemblage will find that, besides the\nmiscellaneous crowd of idlers, there are usually specimens of two classes of\nvery earnest devotees. The one class is intent on the performance of some act\nof ascetic devotion, the object of which is to win the favour of the Divinity,\nor to fulfil a vow for a favour already granted. The other class is seeking\n'to see the Divinity,' and expecting the revelation under one or other of the\nterrible forms of the Hindoo Pantheon. There are few things more pathetic than\nto hear one of this class recount the wanderings and sufferings of his past\nsearch, or the journeys he has before him, which are too often prolonged till\ndeath puts an end to the wanderer and his pilgrimage.\n\nThe 'fire which does not burn' is everywhere in India one of the attributes of\nMahadeo.\n\nIn many parts of the Deccan are to be found shrines consecrated to one of the\nlocal gods, who has been Brahmanically recognised as a local manifestation of\nMahadeo, where the annual festival of the divinity was, within the last few\nyears, kept by lighting huge fires, through which devotees ran or jumped,\nattributing their escape from burning to the interposition of Mahadeo. Except\nin a few remote villages, this custom, which sometimes led to serious\naccidents, has, in British territory, been stopped by the police.\n\nThis story of the wonderful child who was found floating in a box on a river\nis to be heard, with more or less picturesque variations, on the banks of all\nthe large rivers in India. Almost every old village in Sind has a local\ntradition of this kind.\n\nMost households in Calcutta can furnish recollections of depredations by birds\nat their nest-building season, similar to that of the Ranee's bangles by the\nEagles in this story. But the object of the theft is generally more prosaic. I\nhave known gold rings so taken, but the plunder is more frequently a lady's\ncuff, or collar, or a piece of lace; and the plunderers are crows, and\nsometimes, but very rarely, a kite.\n\nPurwaris, or outcasts, who are not suffered to live within the quarter\ninhabited by the higher castes, are very numerous in Southern India, and a\nlegend similar to this one is a frequent popular explanation of their being in\nexcess as compared with other classes of the population.\n\nHOW THE THREE CLEVER MEN OUTWITTED THE DEMONS.\n\nOld residents at Swat may remember an ancient local celebrity named Tom the\nBarber, among whose recollections of former days was a chronicle of a renowned\nduellist, who used to amuse himself by shooting with his pistol, somewhat\nafter the fashion of the Pearlsbooter. The little tin can of hot water which\nTom carried, slung from his forefinger, as he went his morning rounds, was a\nfavourite mark. So were the water-jars on the heads of the women as they\npassed the duellist's house, coming from the well; and great was Tom's relief\nwhen an old woman, who could not be pacified by the usual douceur for the loss\nof her jar and the shock of finding the water stream down her back, appealed\nto the authorities and had the duellist bound over to abstain in future from\nhis dangerous amusement.\n\nSo vivid were Tom's recollections of his own terrors, that, after the lapse of\nhalf a century, he could ill conceal his sense of the poetical justice finally\ninflicted on his tormentor, who was killed in a duel to which he provoked a\nyoung officer who had never before fired a pistol.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd30.htm#fr_98) An instrument so called from its similarity to a tiger's\nclaw. It consists of sharp curved steel blades, set on a bar which fits by\nmeans of finger-rings to the inside of the hand, so as to be concealed when\nthe hand is closed; while the blades project at right angles to the cross-bar\nand palm, when the hand is opened. It is struck with as in slapping or tearing\nwith the claws.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Glossary](odd31.htm)\n\n"
