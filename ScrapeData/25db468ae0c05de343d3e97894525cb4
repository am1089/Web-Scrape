The _S_ akayanins hold that\n'Agni is Vayu (the wind);' but some say that 'Agni is \xc3\x82ditya (the sun).' And\neither _S_ raumatya, or Hali\xe1\xb9\x85gava, said, 'Agni is no other than Vayu:\nwherefore the Adhvaryu, when he performs the last work 3, passes into that\n(wind).'\n\n10:4:5:22\\. And _S_ a _t_ yayani said, 'Agni is no other than the Year; his\nhead is the spring, his right wing the summer, his left wing the rainy season,\nhis middle body (trunk) the autumn season, and his tail and feet the winter\nand dewy seasons--Agni is speech, Vayu breath, the sun the eye, the moon the\nmind, the quarters the ear, the generative power water 4, the feet (and tail)\nfervour, the joints the months, the veins the half-moons, the silver and gold\nfeathers\n\np. 364\n\nthe days and nights: thus he passes over to the gods.' Let him know, then,\nthat Agni is the Year; and let him know that it is thereof 1 he consists.\n\n10:4:5:33\\. And _K_ elaka _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilyayana said, 'Let him know that the\nthree layers containing the naturally-perforated (bricks) 2 are these worlds,\nthat the fourth (layer) is the Sacrificer, and the fifth all objects of\ndesire; and that it is these worlds, and his own self and all his objects of\ndesire he compasses.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[363:2](sbe4365.htm#fr_720) Athanantaram upanishada _m_ rahasyarthanam ade _s_\na upade _s_ a vakshyante.
