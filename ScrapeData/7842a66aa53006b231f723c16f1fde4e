People easily believe in the stories told by\nthose who themselves heard them second hand, and no attempt is made to find\nout the truth by a direct reference to any good treatise. It is generally\nbelieved that the six practices, ( ![](img/_00100.jpg)) in Ha\xe1\xb9\xadha Yoga are\ncompulsory on the student and that besides being dirty, they are fraught with\ndanger to the practiser. This is not true, for these practices are necessary\nonly in the existence of impurities in the Nadis, and not otherwise.\n\nThere is the same amount of misunderstanding with regard to the Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ayama.\nPeople put their faith implicitly in the stories told them about the dangers\nattending the practice, without ever taking the trouble of ascertaining the\nfact themselves. We have been inspiring and expiring air from our birth, and\nwill continue to do so till death; and this is done without the help of any\nteacher. Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ayama is nothing but a properly regulated form of the otherwise\nirregular and hurried flow of air, without using much force or undue\nrestraint; and if this is accomplished by patiently keeping the flow slow and\nsteady, there can be no danger. It is the impatience for the Siddhis which\ncause undue pressure on the organs and thereby causes pains in the ears, the\neyes, the chest, etc. If the three bandhas ( ![](img/_00101.jpg)) be carefully\nperformed while practising the Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ayama, there is no possibility of any\ndanger.\n\nThere are two classes of students of Yoga: (1) those who study it\ntheoretically; (2) those who combine the theory with practice.\n\nYoga is of very little use, if studied theoretically. It was never meant for\nsuch a study. In its practical form, however, the path of the student is beset\nwith difficulties. The books on Yoga give instructions so far as it is\npossible to express the methods in words, but all persons, not being careful\nenough to follow these instructions to the very letter, fail in their object.\nSuch persons require a teacher versed in the practice of Yoga. It is easy to\nfind a teacher who will explain the language of the books, but this is far\nfrom being satisfactory. For instance, a Pandit without any knowledge of the\nscience of Materia Medica will explain  ![](img/_00102.jpg) as\n![](img/_00103.jpg) or an enemy of thorns, _i.e._ , shoes, while it is in\nreality the name of a medicinal plant,\n\np. ii\n\nThe importance of a practical Yogi as a guide to a student of Yoga cannot be\noverestimated; and without such a teacher it is next to impossible for him to\nachieve anything. The methods followed by the founders of the system and\nfollowed ever afterwards by their followers, have been wisely and advisedly\nkept secret; and this is not without a deep meaning. Looking to the gravity of\nthe subject and the practices which have a very close relation with the vital\norgans of the human body, it is of paramount importance that the instructions\nshould be received by students of ordinary capacity, through a practical\nteacher only, in order to avoid any possibility of mistake in practice.\nSpeaking broadly, all men are not equally fitted to receive the instructions\non equal terms. Man inherits on birth his mental and physical capitals,\naccording to his actions in past births, and has to increase them by\nmanipulation, but there are, even among such, different grades. Hence, one\ncannot become a Yogi in one incarnation, as says \xc5\x9ari K\xe1\xb9\x9bi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87a\n![](img/_00200.jpg) and again  ![](img/_00201.jpg)\n\nThere are men who, impelled by the force of their actions of previous births,\ngo headlong and accomplish their liberation in a single attempt; but others\nhave to earn it in their successive births. If the student belongs to one of\nsuch souls and being earnest, desires from his heart to get rid of the pains\nof birth and death, he will find the means too. It is well-known that a true\nYogi is above temptations and so to think that he keeps his knowledge secret\nfor selling it to the highest bidder is simply absurd. Yoga is meant for the\ngood of all creatures, and a true Yogi is always desirous of benefitting as\nmany men as possible. But he is not to throw away this precious treasure\nindiscriminately. He carefully chooses its recipients, and when he finds a\ntrue and earnest student, who will not trifle with this knowledge, he never\nhesitates in placing his valuable treasure at the disposal of the man. What is\nessential in him is that he should have a real thirst for such knowledge\xc2\x97a\nthirst which will make him restless till satisfied; the thirst that will make\nhim blind to the world and its enjoyments. He should be, in short, fired with\n![](img/_00202.jpg) or desire for emancipation. To such a one, there is\nnothing dearer than the accomplishment of this object. A true lover will risk\nhis very life to gain union with his beloved like Tulasidas. A true lover will\nsee everywhere, in every direction, in every tree and leaf, in every blade of\ngrass his own beloved. The whole of the world, with all its beauties, is a\ndreary waste in his eyes, without his beloved. And he will court death, fall\ninto\n\np. iii\n\nthe mouth of a gaping grave, for the sake of his beloved. The student whose\nheart burns with such intense desire for union with Para\xe1\xb9\x83atma, is sure to find\na teacher, and through him he will surely find Him It is a tried experience\nthat Para\xe1\xb9\x83atma will try to meet you half way, with the degree of intensity\nwith which you will go to meet Him. Even He Himself will become your guide,\ndirect you on to the road to success, or put you on the track to find a\nteacher, or lead him to you.\n\nWell has it been said  ![](img/_00300.jpg) It is the half-hearted who fail.\nThey hold their worldly pleasures dearer to their hearts than their God, and\ntherefore He in His turn does not consider them worthy of His favours. Says\nthe Upani\xe1\xb9\xa3ad:\xc2\x97\n\n![](img/_00301.jpg)\n\nThe atma will choose you its abode only if it considers you worthy of such a\nfavour, and not otherwise. It is therefore necessary that one should first\nmake oneself worthy of His acceptance. Having prepared the temple (your heart)\nwell fitted for His installation there, having cleared it of all the\nimpurities which stink and make the place unsuitable for the highest personage\nto live in, and having decorated it beautifully with objects as befit that\nLord of the creation, you need not wait long for Him to adorn this temple of\nyours which you have taken pains to make it worthy of Him. If you have done\nall this, He will shine in you in all His glory. In your difficult moments,\nwhen you are embarrassed, sit in a contemplative mood, and approach your\nParama Guru submissively and refer your difficulties to Him, you are sure to\nget the proper advice from Him. He is the Guru of the ancients, for He is not\nlimited by Time. He instructed the ancients in bygone times, like a Guru, and\nif you have been unable to find a teacher in the human form, enter your inner\ntemple and consult this Great Guru who accompanies you everywhere, and ask Him\nto show you the way. He knows best what is best, for you. Unlike mortal\nbeings, He is beyond the past and the future, will either send one of His\nagents to guide you or lead you to one and put you on the right track. He is\nalways anxious to teach the earnest seekers, and waits for you to offer Him an\nopportunity to do so. But if you have not done your duty and prepared yourself\nworthy of entering His door, and try to gain access to His presence, laden\nwith your unclean burden, stinking with Kama, Krodha, Lobha, and Moha, be sure\nHe will keep you off from Him.\n\np. iv\n\nThe \xc3\x82sanas are a means of gaining steadiness of position and help to gain\nsuccess in contemplation, without any distraction of the mind. If the position\nbe not comfortable, the slightest inconvenience will draw the mind away from\nthe lak\xc5\x9bya (aim), and so no peace of mind will be possible till the posture\nhas ceased to cause pain by regular exercise.\n\nOf all the various methods for concentrating the mind, repetition of Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava\nor Ajapa Japa and contemplation on its meaning is the best. It is impossible\nfor the mind to sit idle even for a single moment, and, therefore, in order to\nkeep it well occupied and to keep other antagonistic thoughts from entering\nit, repetition of Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava should be practised. It should be repeated till Yoga\nNidra is induced which, when experienced, should be encouraged by slackening\nall the muscles of the body. This will fill the mind with sacred and divine\nthoughts and will bring about its one-pointedness, without much effort.\n\nAnahata Nada is awakened by the exercise of Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ayama. A couple of weeks\xc2\x92\npractice with 80 pra\xe1\xb9\x87ayamas in the morning and the same number in the evening\nwill cause distinct sounds to be heard; and, as the practice will go on\nincreasing, varied sounds become audible to the practiser. By hearing these\nsounds attentively one gets concentration of the mind, and thence Sahaja\nSamadhi. When Yoga sleep is experienced, the student should give himself up to\nit and make no efforts to check it. By and by, these sounds become subtle and\nthey become less and less intense, so the mind loses its waywardness and\nbecomes calm and docile; and, on this practice becoming well-established,\nSamadhi becomes a voluntary act. This is, however, the highest stage and is\nthe lot of the favoured and fortunate few only.\n\nDuring contemplation one sees, not with his eyes, as he does the objects of\nthe world, various colours, which the writers on Yoga call the colours of the\nfive elements. Sometimes, stars are seen glittering, and lightning flashes in\nthe sky. But these are all fleeting in their nature.\n\nAt first these colours are seen in greatly agitated waves which show the\nunsteady condition of the mind; and as the practice increases and the mind\nbecomes calm, these colour-waves become steady and motionless and appear as\none deep ocean of light. This is the ocean in which One should dive and forget\nthe world and become one with his Lord\xc2\x97which is the condition of highest\nbliss.\n\nFaith in the practices of Yoga, and in one\'s own powers to accomplish what\nothers have done before, is of great importance to insure speedy success. I\nmean "faith that will move mountains," will accomplish\n\np. v\n\nanything, be it howsoever difficult. There is nothing which cannot be\naccomplished by practice. Says \xc5\x9aiva in \xc5\x9aiva Sa\xe1\xb9\x83hita.\n\n![](img/_00500.jpg)\n\nThrough practice success is obtained; through practice one gains liberation.\n\nPerfect consciousness is gained through practice; Yoga is attained through\npractice; success in mudras comes by practice. Through practice is gained\nsuccess in Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ayama. Death can be evaded of its prey through practice, and\nman becomes the conqueror of death by practice. And then let us gird up our\nloins, and with a firm [resolution](errata.htm#0) engage in the practice,\nhaving faith in  ![](img/_00501.jpg), and the success must be ours. May the\nAlmighty Father, be pleased to shower His blessings on those who thus engage\nin the performance of their duties.
