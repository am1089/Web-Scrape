In the swooning person there is half-combination; this being the\nremaining (hypothesis).\n\nWith regard to a person lying in a swoon or stunned, the question arises\nwhether that state of swoon is one of the other states, viz. deep sleep and so\non, or whether it is a special condition of its own.--The former alternative\nmust be accepted. For the term 'swoon' may be explained as denoting either\ndeep sleep or some other acknowledged state, and there is no authority for\nassuming an altogether different new state.--This view the Sutra sets aside.\nThe condition of a swooning person consists in reaching half, viz. of what\nleads to death; for this is the only hypothesis remaining. A swoon cannot be\neither dreaming or being awake; for in a swoon there is no consciousness. And\nas it is different in character as well as in the occasions giving rise to it\nfrom deep sleep and death, it cannot be either of those two states; for there\nare special circumstances occasioning a swoon, such as a blow on the head. The\nonly possible alternative then is to view a swoon as a state in\n\np. 607\n\nwhich there is made a half-way approach to death. For while death consists in\nthe complete cessation of the soul's connexion with the body or organs of any\nkind, a swoon consists in the soul's remaining connected with the subtle body\nand organs only. Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the swooning person.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 11.
