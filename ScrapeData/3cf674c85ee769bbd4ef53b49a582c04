Of those who have a certain office there is subsistence (of the body) as\nlong as the office lasts.\n\nThe question here is whether for him who has reached true knowledge a new body\noriginates after he has parted with the old one or not.--But an objection is\nhere raised at the outset there is really no occasion for inquiring whether\nknowledge when reaching its perfection brings about its due effect, viz.\ncomplete isolation of the Self from all bodies or not; not any more than there\nis room for an inquiry whether there is cooked rice or not, after the process\nof cooking has reached its due termination; or, for an inquiry whether a man\nis satisfied by eating or not. Not so, we reply. There is indeed room for the\ninquiry proposed, as we know from itihasa and pura _n_ a that some persons\nalthough knowing Brahman yet obtained new bodies. Tradition informs us, e.g.\nthat Apantaratamas, an ancient _ri_ shi and teacher of the Vedas, was, by the\norder of Vishnu, born on this earth as Krishna Dvaipayana at the time when the\nDvaparayuga was succeeded by the Kaliyuga. Similarly Vasish _th_ a, the son of\nBrahman\'s mind, having parted from his former body in consequence of the curse\nof Nimi, was, on the order of Brahman, again procreated by Mitra and Varu _n_\na. Sm _ri_ ti further relates that Bh _ri_ gu and other sons of Brahman\'s mind\nwere again born at the sacrifice of Varu _n_ a. Sanatkumara also, who likewise\nwas a son of Brahman\'s mind, was, in consequence of a boon being granted to\nRudra, born again as Skanda. And there are similar tales about Daksha, Narada,\nand others having, for various reasons, assumed new bodies. Stories of the\nsame kind are met with in the mantras and arthavadas of _S_ ruti. Of some of\nthe persons mentioned it is said that they assumed a new body after the old\nbody had perished; of others that they assumed, through their\n\np. 236\n\nsupernatural powers, various new bodies, while the old body remained intact\nall the while. And all of them are known to have completely mastered the\ncontents of the Vedas.\n\nOn the ground of all this the purvapakshin maintains that the knowledge of\nBrahman may, indifferently, either be or not be the cause of final release.\n\nThis we deny, for the reason that the continuance of the bodily existence of\nAparantamas and others--who are entrusted with offices conducive to the\nsubsistence of the worlds, such as the promulgation of the Vedas and the like\n--depends on those their offices. As Savitar (the sun), who after having for\nthousands of yugas performed the office of watching over these worlds, at the\nend of that period enjoys the condition of release in which he neither rises\nnor sets, according to _Kh_. Up. III, 11, 1, \'When from thence he has risen\nupwards, he neither rises nor sets. He is alone, standing in the centre;\' and\nas the present knowers of Brahman reach the state of isolation after the\nenjoyment of those results of action, which have begun to operate, has come to\nan end, according to _Kh_. Up. VI, 14, 2, \'For him there is only delay so long\nas he is not delivered from the body;\' so Aparantamas and other Lords to whom\nthe highest Lord has entrusted certain offices, last--although they possess\ncomplete knowledge, the cause of release--as long as their office lasts, their\nworks not yet being exhausted, and obtain release only when their office comes\nto an end. For gradually exhausting the aggregate of works the consequences of\nwhich have once begun, so as to enable them to discharge their offices;\npassing according to their free will from one body into another, as if from\none house into another, in order to accomplish the duties of their offices;\npreserving all the time the memory of their identity; they create for\nthemselves through their power over the material of the body and the sense\norgans new bodies, and occupy them either all at once or in succession. Nor\ncan it be said that when passing into new bodies they remember only the fact\nof their former existence (not their individuality); for it is known that they\npreserve the sense\n\np. 237\n\nof their individuality 1. Sm _ri_ ti tells us, e.g. that Sulabha, a woman\nconversant with Brahman, wishing to dispute with _G_ anaka, left her own body,\nentered into that of _G_ anaka, carried on a discussion with him, and again\nreturned into her own body. If in addition to the works the consequences of\nwhich are already in operation, other works manifested themselves,\nconstituting the cause of further embodiments, the result would be that in the\nsame way further works also, whose potentiality would in that case not be\ndestroyed, would take place, and then it might be suspected that the knowledge\nof Brahman may, indifferently, either be or not be the cause of final release.\nBut such a suspicion is inadmissible since it is known from _S_ ruti and Sm\n_ri_ ti that knowledge completely destroys the potentiality of action. For _S_\nruti says, \'The fetter of the heart is broken, all doubts are solved, all his\nworks perish when He has been beheld who is high and low\' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8);\nand, \'When the memory remains firm, then all the ties are loosened\' ( _Kh_.\nUp. VII, 26, 2). And Sm _ri_ ti similarly says, \'As a fire well kindled, O Ar\n_g_ una, reduces fuel to ashes, so the fire of knowledge reduces all actions\nto ashes;\' and, \'As seeds burned by fire do not sprout again, so the Self is\nnot again touched by the afflictions which knowledge has burned.\' Nor is it\npossible that when the afflictions such as ignorance and the like are burned,\nthe aggregate of works which is the seed of affliction should be partly\nburned, but partly keep the power of again springing up; not any more than the\nseed of the _S_ ali, when burned, preserves the power of sprouting again with\nsome part. The aggregate of works, however, whose fruits have once begun to\ndevelop themselves comes to rest through effecting a delay which terminates\nwith the death of the body, just as an arrow discharged stops in the end owing\nto the gradual cessation of its impetus; this in agreement with _Kh_. Up. VI,\n14, 2, \'For him there is only delay,\' &c. We have thus shown that persons to\nwhom an office is\n\np. 238\n\nentrusted last as long as their office lasts, and that nevertheless there is\nabsolutely only one result of true knowledge.--In accordance with this,\nscripture declares that the result of knowledge on the part of all beings is\nequally final release, cp. \'So whatever Deva was awakened he indeed became\nthat, and the same with Rishis and men\' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10). Moreover\n[1](sbe38176.htm#fn_152) it may be the case that (some) great _ri_ shis had\nattached their minds to other cognitions whose result is lordly power and the\nlike, and that later on only when they became aware of the transitory nature\nof those results they turned from them and fixed their minds on the highest\nSelf, whereby they obtained final release. As Sm _ri_ ti says, \'When the\nmahapralaya has arrived and the highest (i.e. Hira _n_ yagarbha) himself comes\nto an end, then they all, with well-prepared minds, reach together with\nBrahman the highest place.\'--Another reason precluding the suspicion that true\nknowledge may be destitute of its result is that that result is the object of\nimmediate intuition. In the case of such results of action as the heavenly\nworld and the like which are not present to intuitional knowledge, there may\nbe a doubt; but not so in the case of the fruit of true knowledge, with regard\nto which scripture says. \'The Brahman which is present to intuition, not\nhidden\' (B _ri_. Up. III, 4, 1), and which in the passage, \'That art thou,\' is\nreferred to as something already accomplished. This latter passage cannot be\ninterpreted to mean, \'Thou wilt be that after thou hast died;\' for another\nVedic passage declares that the fruit of complete knowledge, viz. union with\nthe universal Self, springs up at the moment when complete knowledge is\nattained, \'The _Ri_ shi Vamadeva saw and understood it, singing, "I was Manu,\nI was the sun."\n\nFor all these reasons we maintain that those who possess true knowledge reach\nin all cases final release.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[237:1](sbe38175.htm#fr_151) Utpadyamananam aparimushitasmaratve\xe0\xa4\xbdpi _g_\natismaratvam eva na vasish _th_ adinanatvam ity a _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kyaha na _k_ eti. \xc3\x82n.\nGi.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 33](sbe38176.htm)\n\n'
