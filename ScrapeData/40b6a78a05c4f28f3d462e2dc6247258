What a stupendous joy there was in this unquestioning surrender.\nVerily had I realized how, in thoroughness of self-destruction, man can find\nsupreme bliss.\n\nFor aught I know, this frenzy of mine might have come to a gradual, natural\nend. But Sandip Babu would not have it so, he would insist on revealing\nhimself. The tone of his voice became as intimate as a touch, every look flung\nitself on its knees in beggary. And, through it all, there burned a passion\nwhich in its violence made as though it would tear me up by the roots, and\ndrag me along by the hair.\n\nI will not shirk the truth. This cataclysmal desire drew me by day and by\nnight. It seemed desperately alluring--this making havoc of myself. What a\nshame it seemed, how terrible, and yet how sweet! Then there was my\noverpowering curiosity, to which there seemed no limit. He of whom I knew but\nlittle, who never could assuredly be mine, whose youth flared so vigorously in\na hundred points of flame--oh, the mystery of his seething passions, so\nimmense, so tumultuous!\n\nI began with a feeling of worship, but that soon passed away. I ceased even to\nrespect Sandip; on the contrary, I began to look down upon him. Nevertheless\nthis flesh-and-blood lute of mine, fashioned with my feeling and fancy, found\nin him a master-player. What though I shrank from his touch, and even came to\nloathe the lute itself; its music was conjured up all the same.\n\nI must confess there was something in me which ... what shall I say? ... which\nmakes me wish I could have died!\n\nChandranath Babu, when he finds leisure, comes to me. He has the power to lift\nmy mind up to an eminence from where I can see in a moment the boundary of my\nlife extended on all sides and so realize that the lines, which I took from my\nbounds, were merely imaginary.\n\nBut what is the use of it all? Do I really desire emancipation? Let suffering\ncome to our house; let the best in me shrivel up and become black; but let\nthis infatuation not leave me--such seems to be my prayer.\n\nWhen, before my marriage, I used to see a brother-in-law of mine, now dead,\nmad with drink--beating his wife in his frenzy, and then sobbing and howling\nin maudlin repentance, vowing never to touch liquor again, and yet, the very\nsame evening, sitting down to drink and drink--it would fill me with disgust.\nBut my intoxication today is still more fearful. The stuff has not to be\nprocured or poured out: it springs within my veins, and I know not how to\nresist it.\n\nMust this continue to the end of my days? Now and again I start and look upon\nmyself, and think my life to be a nightmare which will vanish all of a sudden\nwith all its untruth. It has become so frightfully incongruous. It has no\nconnection with its past. What it is, how it could have come to this pass, I\ncannot understand.\n\nOne day my sister-in-law remarked with a cutting laugh: "What a wonderfully\nhospitable Chota Rani we have! Her guest absolutely will not budge. In our\ntime there used to be guests, too; but they had not such lavish looking after\n--we were so absurdly taken up with our husbands. Poor brother Nikhil is\npaying the penalty of being born too modern. He should have come as a guest if\nhe wanted to stay on. Now it looks as if it were time for him to quit ... O\nyou little demon, do your glances never fall, by chance, on his agonized\nface?"\n\nThis sarcasm did not touch me; for I knew that these women had it not in them\nto understand the nature of the cause of my devotion. I was then wrapped in\nthe protecting armour of the exaltation of sacrifice, through which such\nshafts were powerless to reach and shame me.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII](hw14.htm)\n\n'
