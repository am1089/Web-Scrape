Upon that glorious eminence, rich with mineral treasures, as upon\na splendid couch, the deity \xc5\x9aiva reclined, accompanied by the daughter of the\nsovereign of mountains, and attended by the mighty \xc3\x81dityas, the powerful\nVasus, and by the heavenly physicians, the sons of Aswini; by Kuvera,\nsurrounded by his train of Guhyakas, the lord of the Yakshas, who dwells on\nKailasa. There also was the great Muni Usanas: there, were Rishis of the first\norder, with Sanatkumara at their head; divine Rishis, preceded by Angiras;\nVi\xc5\x9bwavasu, with his bands of heavenly choristers; the sages Narada and\nParvata; and innumerable troops of celestial nymphs. The breeze blew upon the\nmountain, bland, pure, and fragrant; and the trees were decorated with\nflowers, that blossomed in every season. The Vidyadharas and Siddhas, affluent\nin devotion, waited upon Mahadeva, the lord of living creatures; and many\nother beings, of various forms, did him homage. Rakshasas of terrific\nsemblance, and Pisachas of great strength, of different shapes and features,\narmed with various weapons, and blazing like fire, were delighted to be\npresent, as the followers of the god. There stood the royal Nandi, high in the\nfavour of his lord, armed with a fiery trident, shining with inherent lustre;\nand there the best of rivers, Ganga, the assemblage of all holy waters, stood\nadoring the mighty deity. Thus worshipped by all the most excellent of sages\nand of gods, abode the omnipotent and all-glorious Mahadeva.\n\n"In former times, Daksha commenced a holy sacrifice on the side of Himavan, at\nthe sacred spot Gangadwara, frequented by the Rishis. The gods, desirous of\nassisting at this solemn rite, came, with Indra at their head, to Mahadeva,\nand intimated their purpose; and having received his permission, departed in\ntheir splendid chariots to Gangadwara, as tradition reports 2. They found\nDaksha, the best of the devout,\n\np. 63\n\nsurrounded by the singers and nymphs of heaven, and by numerous sages, beneath\nthe shade of clustering trees and climbing plants; and all of them, whether\ndwellers on earth, in air, or in the regions above the skies, approached the\npatriarch with outward gestures of respect. The \xc3\x81dityas, Vasus, Rudras,\nMaruts, all entitled to partake of the oblations, together with Jishn\xcc\x81u, were\npresent. The four classes of Pitris, Ushmapas, Somapas, \xc3\x81jyapas, and Dhumapas,\nor those who feed upon the flame, the acid juice, the butter, or the smoke of\nofferings, the Aswins and the progenitors, came along with Brahma. Creatures\nof every class, born from the womb, the egg, from vapour, or vegetation, came\nupon their invocation; as did all the gods, with their brides, who in their\nresplendent vehicles blazed like so many fires. Beholding them thus assembled,\nthe sage Dadhicha was filled with indignation, and observed, \'The man who\nworships what ought not to be worshipped, or pays not reverence where\nveneration is due, is guilty, most assuredly, of heinous sin.\' Then addressing\nDaksha, he said to him, \'Why do you not offer homage to the god who is the\nlord of life (Pa\xc5\x9bubhartri)?\' Daksha spake; \'I have already many Rudras\npresent, armed with tridents, wearing braided hair, and existing in eleven\nforms: I recognise no other Mahadeva.\' Dadhicha spake; \'The invocation that is\nnot addressed to \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9ba, is, for all, but a solitary (and imperfect) summons.\nInasmuch as I behold no other divinity who is superior to \xc5\x9aankara, this\nsacrifice of Daksha will not be completed.\' Daksha spake; I offer, in a golden\ncup, this entire oblation, which has been consecrated by many prayers, as an\noffering ever due to the unequalled Vishn\xcc\x81u, the sovereign lord of all 3.\'\n\np. 64\n\n"In the meanwhile, the virtuous daughter of the mountain king, observing the\ndeparture of the divinities, addressed her lord, the god of living beings, and\nsaid--Uma spake--\'Whither, oh lord, have the gods, preceded by Indra, this day\ndeparted? Tell me truly, oh thou who knowest all truth, for a great doubt\nperplexes me.\' Mahe\xc5\x9bwara spake; Illustrious goddess, the excellent patriarch\nDaksha celebrates the sacrifice of a horse, and thither the gods repair.\' Devi\nspake; Why then, most mighty god, dost thou also not proceed to this\nsolemnity? by what hinderance is thy progress thither impeded?\' Mahe\xc5\x9bwara\nspake; \'This is the contrivance, mighty queen, of all the gods, that in all\nsacrifices no portion should be assigned to me. In consequence of an\narrangement formerly devised, the gods allow me, of right, no participation of\n[sacrificial](errata.htm#3) offerings.\' Devi spake; \'The lord god lives in all\nbodily forms, and his might is eminent through his superior faculties; he is\nunsurpassable, he is unapproachable, in splendour and glory and power. That\nsuch as he should be excluded from his share of oblations, fills me with deep\nsorrow, and a trembling, oh sinless, seizes upon my frame. Shall I now\npractise bounty, restraint, or penance, so that my lord, who is inconceivable,\nmay obtain a share, a half or a third portion, of the sacrifice 4?\'\n\np. 65\n\n"Then the mighty and incomprehensible deity, being pleased, said to his bride,\nthus agitated; and speaking; \'Slender-waisted queen of the gods, thou knowest\nnot the purport of what thou sayest; but I know it, oh thou with large eyes,\nfor the holy declare all things by meditation. By thy perplexity this day are\nall the gods, with Mahendra and all the three worlds, utterly confounded. In\nmy sacrifice, those who worship me, repeat my praises, and chant the\nRathantara song of the Sama veda; my priests worship me in the sacrifice of\ntrue wisdom, where no officiating Brahman is needed; and in this they offer me\nmy portion.\' Devi spake; \'The lord is the root of all, and assuredly, in every\nassemblage of the female world, praises or hides himself at will.\' Mahadeva\nspake; \'Queen of the gods, I praise not myself: approach, and behold whom I\nshall create for the purpose of claiming my share of the rite.\'\n\n"Having thus spoken to his beloved spouse, the mighty Mahe\xc5\x9bwara created from\nhis mouth a being like the fire of fate; a divine being, with a thousand\nheads, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet; wielding a thousand clubs, a thousand\nshafts; holding the shell, the discus, the mace, and bearing a blazing bow and\nbattle-axe; fierce and terrific, shining with dreadful splendour, and\ndecorated with the crescent moon; clothed in a tiger\'s skin, dripping with\nblood; having a capacious stomach, and a vast mouth, armed with formidable\ntusks: his ears were erect, his lips were pendulous, his tongue was lightning;\nhis hand brandished the thunderbolt;\n\np. 66\n\nflames streamed from his hair; a necklace of pearls wound round his neck; a\ngarland of flame descended on his breast: radiant with lustre, he looked like\nthe final fire that consumes the world. Four tremendous tusks projected from a\nmouth which extended from ear to ear: he was of vast bulk, vast strength, a\nmighty male and lord, the destroyer of the universe, and like a large fig-tree\nin circumference; shining like a hundred moons at once; fierce as the fire of\nlove; having four heads, sharp white teeth, and of mighty fierceness, vigour,\nactivity, and courage; glowing with the blaze of a thousand fiery suns at the\nend of the world; like a thousand undimmed moons: in bulk like Himadri,\nKailasa, or Meru, or Mandara, with all its gleaming herbs; bright as the sun\nof destruction at the end of ages; of irresistible prowess, and beautiful\naspect; irascible, with lowering eyes, and a countenance burning like fire;\nclothed in the hide of the elephant and lion, and girt round with snakes;\nwearing a turban on his head, a moon on his brow; sometimes savage, sometimes\nmild; having a chaplet of many flowers on his head, anointed with various\nunguents, and adorned with different ornaments and many sorts of jewels;\nwearing a garland of heavenly Karnikara flowers, and rolling his eyes with\nrage. Sometimes he danced; sometimes he laughed aloud; sometimes he stood\nwrapt in meditation; sometimes he trampled upon the earth; sometimes he sang;\nsometimes he wept repeatedly: and he was endowed with the faculties of wisdom,\ndispassion, power, penance, truth, endurance, fortitude, dominion, and self-\nknowledge.\n\n"This being, then, knelt down upon the ground, and raising his hands\nrespectfully to his head, said to Mahadeva, \'Sovereign of the gods, command\nwhat it is that I must do for thee.\' To which Mahe\xc5\x9bwara replied, Spoil the\nsacrifice of Daksha.\' Then the mighty Virabhadra, having heard the pleasure of\nhis lord, bowed down his head to the feet of Prajapati; and starting like a\nlion loosed from bonds, despoiled the sacrifice of Daksha, knowing that the\nhad been created by the displeasure of Devi. She too in her wrath, as the\nfearful goddess Rudrakali, accompanied him, with all her train, to witness his\ndeeds. Virabhadra the fierce, abiding in the region of ghosts, is the minister\nof the anger of\n\np. 67\n\n[paragraph continues] Devi. And he then created, from the pores of his skin,\npowerful demigods, the mighty attendants upon Rudra, of equal valour and\nstrength, who started by hundreds and thousands into existence. Then a loud\nand confused clamour filled all the expanse of ether, and inspired the\ndenizens of heaven with dread. The mountains tottered, and earth shook; the\nwinds roared, and the depths of the sea were disturbed; the fires lost their\nradiance, and the sun grew pale; the planets of the firmament shone not,\nneither did the stars give light; the Rishis ceased their hymns, and gods and\ndemons were mute; and thick darkness eclipsed the chariots of the skies 5.\n\n"Then from the gloom emerged fearful and numerous forms, shouting the cry of\nbattle; who instantly broke or overturned the sacrificial columns, trampled\nupon the altars, and danced amidst the oblations. Running wildly hither and\nthither, with the speed of wind, they tossed about the implements and vessels\nof sacrifice, which looked like stars precipitated from the heavens. The piles\nof food and beverage for the gods, which had been heaped up like mountains;\nthe rivers of milk; the banks of curds and butter; the sands of honey and\nbutter-milk and sugar; the mounds of condiments and spices of every flavour;\nthe undulating knolls of flesh and other viands; the celestial liquors,\npastes, and confections, which had been prepared; these the spirits of wrath\ndevoured or defiled or scattered abroad. Then falling upon the host of the\ngods, these vast and resistless Rudras beat or terrified them, mocked and\ninsulted the nymphs and goddesses, and quickly put an end to the rite,\nalthough defended by all the gods; being the ministers of Rudra\'s wrath, and\nsimilar to himself 6. Some then made a hideous clamour, whilst others\nfearfully shouted, when Yajna was decapitated. For the\n\np. 68\n\ndivine Yajna, the lord of sacrifice, then began to fly up to heaven, in the\nshape of a deer; and Virabhadra, of immeasurable spirit, apprehending his\npower, cut off his vast head, after he had mounted into the sky 7. Daksha the\npatriarch, his sacrifice being destroyed, overcome with terror, and utterly\nbroken in spirit, fell then upon the ground, where his head was spurned by the\nfeet of the cruel Virabhadra 8. The thirty scores of sacred divinities were\nall presently bound, with a band of fire, by their lion-like foe; and they all\nthen addressed him, crying, \'Oh Rudra, have mercy upon thy servants: oh lord,\ndismiss thine anger.\' Thus spake Brahma and the other gods, and the patriarch\nDaksha; and raising their hands, they said, \'Declare, mighty being, who thou\nart.\' Virabhadra said, \'I am not a god, nor an \xc3\x81ditya; nor am I come hither\nfor enjoyment, nor curious to behold the chiefs of the divinities: know that I\nam come to destroy the sacrifice of Daksha, and that I am called Virabhadra,\nthe issue of the wrath of Rudra. Bhadrakali also, who has sprung from the\nanger of Devi, is sent here by the god of gods to destroy this rite. Take\nrefuge, king of kings, with him who is the lord of Uma; for better is the\nanger of Rudra than the blessings of other gods.\'\n\np. 69\n\n"Having heard the words of Virabhadra, the righteous Daksha propitiated the\nmighty god, the holder of the trident, Mahe\xc5\x9bwara. The hearth of sacrifice,\ndeserted by the Brahmans, had been consumed; Yajna had been metamorphosed to\nan antelope; the fires of Rudra\'s wrath had been kindled; the attendants,\nwounded by the tridents of the servants of the god, were groaning with pain;\nthe pieces of the uprooted sacrificial posts were scattered here and there;\nand the fragments of the meat-offerings were carried off by flights of hungry\nvultures, and herds of howling jackals. Suppressing his vital airs, and taking\nup a posture of meditation, the many-sighted victor of his foes, Daksha fixed\nhis eyes every where upon his thoughts. Then the god of gods appeared from the\naltar, resplendent as a thousand suns, and smiled upon him, and said, \'Daksha,\nthy sacrifice has been destroyed through sacred knowledge: I am well pleased\nwith thee:\' and then he smiled again, and said, \'What shall I do for thee;\ndeclare, together with the preceptor of the gods.\'\n\n"Then Daksha, frightened, alarmed, and agitated, his eyes suffused with tears,\nraised his hands reverentially to his brow, and said, \'If, lord, thou art\npleased; if I have found favour in thy sight; if I am to be the object of thy\nbenevolence; if thou wilt confer upon me a boon, this is the blessing I\nsolicit, that all these provisions for the solemn sacrifice, which have been\ncollected with much trouble and during a long time, and which have now been\neaten, drunk, devoured, burnt, broken, scattered abroad, may not have been\nprepared in vain.\' \'So let it be,\' replied Hara, the subduer of Indra. And\nthereupon Daksha knelt down upon the earth, and praised gratefully the author\nof righteousness, the three-eyed god Mahadeva, repeating the eight thousand\nnames of the deity whose emblem is a bull."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[61:1](vp043.htm#fr_221) The sacrifice of Daksha is a legend of some interest,\nfrom its historical and archeological relations. It is obviously intended to\nintimate a struggle between the worshippers of \xc5\x9aiva and of Vishn\xcc\x81u, in which\nat first the latter, but finally the former, acquired the ascendancy. It is\nalso a favourite subject of Hindu sculpture, at least with the Hindus of the\n\xc5\x9aaiva division, and makes a conspicuous figure both at Elephanta and Ellora. A\nrepresentation of the dispersion and mutilation of the gods and sages by\nVirabhadra, at the former, is published in the Archaeologia, VII. 326, where\nit is described as the Judgment of Solomon! a figure of Virabhadra is given by\nNiebuhr, vol. II. tab. 10: and the entire group in the Bombay Transactions,\nvol. I. p. 220. It is described, p. 229; but Mr. Erskine has not verified the\nsubject, although it cannot admit of doubt. The groupe described, p. 224,\nprobably represents the introductory details given in our text. Of the Ellora\nsculptures, a striking one occurs in what Sir C. Malet calls the Doomar Leyna\ncave, where is "Veer Budder, with eight hands. In one is suspended the slain\nRajah Dutz." A. R. VI. 396. And there is also a representation of \'Ehr Budr,\'\nin one of the colonades of Kailas; being, in fact, the same figure as that at\nElephanta. Bombay Tr. III. 287. The legend of Daksha therefore was popular\nwhen those cavern temples were excavated. The story is told in much more\ndetail in several other Puran\xcc\x81as, and with some variations, which will be\nnoticed: but the above has been selected as a specimen of the style of the\nVayu Puran\xcc\x81a, and as being a narration which, from its\n[inartificial](errata.htm#2), obscure, tautological, and uncircumstantial\nconstruction, is probably of an ancient date. The same legend, in the same\nwords, is given in the Brahma P.\n\n[62:2](vp043.htm#fr_222) Or this may he understood to imply, that the original\nstory is in the Vedas; the term being, as usual in such a reference, ###.\nGangadwara, the place where the Ganges descends to the plains--or Haridwar, as\nit is more usually termed--is usually specified as the scene of action, The\nLinga is more precise, calling it Kanakhala, which is the village still called\nKankhal, near Haridwar (Megha Duta, p. 63 p. 59). It rather inaccurately,\nhowever, describes this as upon Hansa peak, a point of the Himalaya.\n\n[63:3](vp043.htm#fr_223) The Kurma P. gives also this discussion between\nDadhicha and Daksha, and their dialogue contains some curious matter. Daksha,\nfor instance, states that no portion of a sacrifice is ever allotted to \xc5\x9aiva,\nand no prayers are directed to be addressed to him, or to his bride. Dadhicha\napparently evades the objection, and claims a share for Rudra, consisting of\nthe triad of gods, as one with the sun, who is undoubtedly hymned by the\nseveral ministering priests of the Vedas. Daksha replies, that the twelve\n\xc3\x81dityas receive special oblations; that they are all the suns; and p. 64 that\nhe knows of no other. The Munis, who overhear the dispute, concur in his\nsentiments. These notions seem to have been exchanged for others in the days\nof the Padma P. and Bhagavata, as they place Daksha\'s neglect of \xc5\x9aiva to the\nlatter\'s filthy practices, his going naked, smearing himself with ashes,\ncarrying a skull, and behaving as if he were drunk or crazed: alluding, no\ndoubt, to the practices of \xc5\x9aaiva mendicants, who seem to have abounded in the\ndays of \xc5\x9aankara \xc3\x81charya, and since. There is no discussion in the Bhagavata,\nbut Rudra is described as present at a former assembly, when his father-in-law\ncensured him before the guests, and in consequence he departed in a rage. His\nfollower Nandi curses the company, and Bhrigu retorts in language descriptive\nof the Vamacharis, or left hand worshippers of \xc5\x9aiva. "May all those," he says,\n"who adopt the worship of Bhava (\xc5\x9aiva), all those who follow the practices of\nhis worshippers, become heretics, and oppugners of holy doctrines; may they\nneglect the observances of purification; may they be of infirm intellects,\nwearing clotted hair, and ornamenting themselves with ashes and bones; and may\nthey enter the \xc5\x9aaiva initiation, in which spirituous liquor is the libation."\n\n[64:4](vp043.htm#fr_224) This simple account of Sati\'s share in the\ntransaction is considerably modified in p. 64 other accounts. In the Kurma,\nthe quarrel begins with Daksha the patriarch\'s being, as he thinks, treated by\nhis son-in-law with less respect than is his due. Upon his daughter Sati\'s\nsubsequently visiting him, he abuses her husband, and turns her out of his\nhouse. She in spite destroys herself. \xc5\x9aiva, hearing of this, comes to Daksha,\nand curses him to be born as a Kshetriya, the son of the Prachetasas, and to\nbeget a son on his own daughter. It is in this subsequent birth that the\nsacrifice occurs. The Linga and Matsya allude to the dispute between Daksha\nand Sati, and to the latter\'s putting an end to herself by Yoga. The Padma,\nBhagavata, and Skanda in the Kasi Khanda, relate the dispute between father\nand daughter in a like manner, and in more detail. The first refers the death\nof Sag, however, to a prior period; and that and the Bhagavata both ascribe it\nto Yoga. The Kasi Khanda, with an improvement indicative of a later age, makes\nSati throw herself into the fire prepared for the solemnity.\n\n[67:5](vp043.htm#fr_225) The description of Virabhadra and his followers is\ngiven in other Puran\xcc\x81as in the same strain, but with less detail.\n\n[67:6](vp043.htm#fr_226) Their exploits, and those of Virabhadra, are more\nparticularly specified elsewhere, especially in the Linga, Kurma, and\nBhagavata Puran\xcc\x81as. Indra is knocked down and trampled on; Yama has his staff\nbroken; Saraswati and the Matris have their noses cut off; Mitra or Bhaga has\nhis eyes pulled out; Pusha has his teeth knocked down his throat; Chandra is\npummelled; Vahni\'s hands are cut off; Bhrigu loses his beard; the Brahmans are\npelted with stones; the Prajapatis are beaten; and the gods and demigods are\nrun through with swords or stuck with arrows.\n\n[68:7](vp043.htm#fr_227) This is also mentioned in the Linga and in the Hari\nVan\xc5\x9ba: and the latter thus accounts for the origin of the constellation\nMrigasiras; Yajna, with the head of a deer, being elevated to the planetary\nregion, by Brahma.\n\n[68:8](vp043.htm#fr_228) As he prays to \xc5\x9aiva presently, it could not well be\nmeant here that Daksha was decapitated, although that is the story in other\nplaces. The Linga and Bhagavata both state that Virabhadra cut off Daksha\'s\nhead, and threw it into the fire. After the fray therefore, when \xc5\x9aiva restored\nthe dead to life, and the mutilated to their limbs, Daksha\'s head was not\nforthcoming: it was therefore replaced by the head of a goat, or, according to\nthe Kasi Khanda, that of a ram. No notice is taken in our text of the conflict\nelsewhere described between Virabhadra and Vishn\xcc\x81u. In the Linga, the latter\nis beheaded, and his head is blown by the wind into the fire. The Kurma,\nthough a \xc5\x9aaiva Puran\xcc\x81a, is less irreverent towards Vishn\xcc\x81u, and after\ndescribing a contest in which both parties occasionally prevail, makes Brahma\ninterpose, and separate the combatants. The Kasi Khanda of the Skanda P.\ndescribes Vishn\xcc\x81u as defeated, and at the mercy of Virabhadra, who is\nprohibited by a voice from heaven from destroying his antagonist: whilst in\nthe Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, Vishn\xcc\x81u compels \xc5\x9aiva to fly, after taking him by the throat\nand nearly strangling him. The blackness of \xc5\x9aiva\'s neck arose from this\nthrottling, and not, as elsewhere described, from his drinking the poison\nproduced at the churning of the ocean.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IX](vp044.htm)\n\n'
