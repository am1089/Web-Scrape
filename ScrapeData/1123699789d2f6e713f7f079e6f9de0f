And the best (i.e. the chief vital air).\n\nThe Sutra extends to the chief vital air (mukhya pra _n_ a) a quality already\nasserted of the other pra _n_ as, viz. being an effect of Brahman.--But, an\nobjection may be raised, it has already been stated of all pra _n_ as without\ndifference that they are effects of Brahman; e.g. the passage, 'From him\n\np. 85\n\nis born breath, mind, and all organs of sense' (Mu. Up. II. 1, 3), states the\norigin of pra _n_ a separately from the senses and the manas; and there are\nother passages also such as 'He sent forth pra _n_ a' (Pr. Up. VI, 4). Why\nthen the formal extension?--We reply: For the purpose of removing further\ndoubt. For in the Nasadiya-sukta whose subject is Brahman there occurs the\nfollowing mantra: 'There was neither death nor the Immortal; nor manifestation\nof either night or day. By its own law the One was breathing without wind;\nthere was nothing different from that or higher than it' ( _Ri_. Sa _m_ h. X,\n129, 2). Here the words, 'was breathing' which denote the proper function of\nbreath, intimate that breath existed as it were before the creation. And\ntherefrom it might be concluded that pra _n_ a is not produced; an idea which\nthe Sutrakara discards by the formal extension (to pra _n_ a of the quality of\nhaving originated from Brahman).--Moreover the word 'breathed' does not\nintimate that pra _n_ a existed before the creation; for in the first place it\nis qualified by the addition 'without wind,' and in the second place\nscriptural passages--such as 'He is without breath, without mind, pure' (Mu.\nUp. II, 1, 2)--declare expressly that the causal substance is without any\nqualifications such as pra _n_ a and so on. Hence the word 'breathed' has\nmerely the purpose of setting forth the existence of the cause.--The term 'the\nbest' (employed in the Sutra) denotes the chief vital air, according to the\ndeclaration of scripture, 'Breath indeed is the oldest and the best' ( _Kh_.\nUp. V, 1, 1). The breath is the oldest because it begins its function from the\nmoment when the child is conceived; the senses of hearing, &c., on the other\nhand, begin to act only when their special seats, viz. the cars, &c., are\nformed, and they are thus not 'the oldest.' The designation 'the best' belongs\nto the pra _n_ a on account of its superior qualities and on account of the\npassage, 'We shall not be able to live without thee' (B _ri_. Up. VI, 1, 13).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 9](sbe38063.htm)\n\n"
