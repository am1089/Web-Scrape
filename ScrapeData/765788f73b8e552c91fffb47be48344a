(There would be) absence of definite rule, as in the case of\nconsciousness.\n\nThe Sutra points out a difficulty which arises on the view of the Self not\nbeing an agent. Sutra 32 has declared that if the Self were all-pervading it\nwould follow that there would be no definite determination with regard to\nconsciousness. Similarly, if the Self were not an agent but all activity\nbelonged to Prak _ri_ ti it would follow that as Prak _ri_ ti is a common\npossession of all souls, all actions would result in enjoyment (experience) on\nthe part of all souls, or else on the part of none; for as each Self is held\nto be omnipresent, they are all of them in equal proximity to all parts of the\nPradhana. For the same reason it could not be maintained that the distribution\nof results between the different souls depends on the different internal\norgans which are joined to the souls; for if the souls are omnipresent, no\nsoul will be exclusively connected with any particular internal organ.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 37.
