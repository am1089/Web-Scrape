Haradatta takes a _k_ am here to mean \'to\ndrink water,\' and thinks that it is forbidden to do this standing or in a bent\nposition. Others refer the prohibition to \'sipping water for the sake of\npurification,\' and translate, \'He shall not sip water standing or in a bent\nposition (except in case of necessity),\' i.e. if the bank of the river is so\nhigh that he cannot reach the water sitting down, and in this case he shall\nenter it up to his thighs or up to his navel.\n\n[57:2](sbe0219.htm#fr_359) Manu II, 60 and 62; V, 139; and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 20\nand 27; Weber. Ind. Stud. X, 165. Haradatta observes, that the further\nparticulars regarding purification by sipping water must be supplied from\nother Sm _ri_ tis. The rule quoted by him is as follows: \'The performer should\nbe sitting in a pure place, not on a seat, except when sipping water after\ndinner, and should sip thrice from his hand water which is free from bubbles\nand foam, and which he has attentively regarded, in such a quantity as would\ncover a Masha-bean. p. 58 The water sipped by a Brahman should reach his\nheart, that sipped by a Kshatriya the throat, and that sipped by a Vai _s_ ya\nthe palate. A _S_ udra sips once as much as to wet his tongue.\'\n\n[58:7](sbe0219.htm#fr_360) The eyes are to be touched with the thumb and the\nfourth finger, either at once, or one after the other, the nostrils with the\nthumb and the second finger, the ears with the thumb and the small finger.\n\n[58:9](sbe0219.htm#fr_361) Manu V, 138.\n\n[58:11](sbe0219.htm#fr_362) Haradatta observes that this Sutra shows, that\nevery other foreign substance brought with the food into the mouth, makes the\nfood \'leavings\' and the eater impure. Manu V, 141.\n\n[58:12](sbe0219.htm#fr_363) Manu V, 141 declares sipping to be unnecessary in\nthis case.\n\n[59:14](sbe0219.htm#fr_364) Manu V, 145.\n\n[59:18](sbe0219.htm#fr_365) The term "ten days" is used in order to indicate\nthe time of impurity generally. In some cases, as that of a Kshatriya, this\nlasts longer. In other cases, where the impurity lasts thirty-six hours only,\n(the abstention from dining in such houses is shorter.)\'--Haradatta. Manu IV,\n217.\n\n[59:19](sbe0219.htm#fr_366) A lying-in woman is impure, and must not be\ntouched during the first ten days after her confinement. During this time, she\nexclusively occupies the Sutikag _ri_ ha, or lying-in chamber. Manu IV, 217.\n\n[59:20](sbe0219.htm#fr_367) Haradatta remarks that in the case of the death of\na person who is not a relation, it is customary to place at the distance of\n\'one hundred bows\' a lamp and water-vessel, and to eat (beyond that distance).\n\n[60:21](sbe0219.htm#fr_368) \'Food which is simply impure, may be purified by\nputting it on the fire, sprinkling it with water, touching it with ashes or\nearth, and praising it.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[60:22](sbe0219.htm#fr_369) Others say, that the food becomes unfit for\neating, only, if in bringing it, the _S_ udra has touched it.--Haradatta.\n\n[60:23](sbe0219.htm#fr_370) Manu IV, 207; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 167. \'But this rule\nholds good only if the hair had been cooked with the food. If a hair falls\ninto it at dinner, then it is to be purified by an addition of clarified\nbutter, and may be eaten.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[60:24](sbe0219.htm#fr_371) Haradatta quotes a passage from Baudhayana, which\nenumerates as \'unclean things\' here intended, \'hair, worms or beetles, nail-\nparings, excrements of rats.\' The rule must be understood as the preceding,\ni.e. in case these things have been cooked with the food.\n\n[60:26](sbe0219.htm#fr_372) Manu IV, 207: Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 167, 168. This Sutra\nmust be read with Sutra 23 above.\n\n[60:30](sbe0219.htm#fr_373) Manu IV, 208; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 167. Apapatras are\npersons whom one must not allow to eat from one\'s dishes, e.g. _K_ a _n_ _d_\nalas, Patitas, a woman in her courses or during the ten days of impurity after\nconfinement. See also above, I, 1, 3, 25.\n\n[61:32](sbe0219.htm#fr_374) Haradatta thinks, that as the Sutra has the\nfeminine gender, dasi, it does not matter if a male slave brings the food. But\nothers forbid also this.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 5, Kha _n_ _d_ a 17](sbe0220.htm)\n\n'
