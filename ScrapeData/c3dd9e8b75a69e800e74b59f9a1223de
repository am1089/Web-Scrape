XVI.\n\nDescendants of Turvasu.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--I shall now summarily give you an account of the descendants of\nTurvasu.\n\nThe son of Turvasu was Vahni 1; his son was Gobanu 2; his son was Trai\xc5\x9bamba 3;\nhis son was Karandhama; his son was Marutta. Marutta had no children, and he\ntherefore adopted Dushyanta, of the family of Puru; by which the line of\nTurvasu merged into that of Puru 4. This took place in consequence of the\nmalediction denounced on his son by Yayati 5.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[442:1](vp109.htm#fr_1184) Varga: Agni.\n\n[442:2](vp109.htm#fr_1185) Bhanumat: Bhagavata, which also inserts Bhaga\nbefore him.\n\n[442:3](vp109.htm#fr_1186) Tribhanu: Vayu. Tri\xc5\x9banu: Brahma. Trai\xc5\x9bali: Agni.\nTri\xc5\x9bari: Matsya.\n\n[442:4](vp109.htm#fr_1187) Besides Bharata, who, as will be hereafter seen,\nwas the son of Dushyanta, the Vayu, Matsya, Agni, and Brahma Puran\xcc\x81as\nenumerate several descendants in this line, for the purpose evidently of\nintroducing, as the posterity of Turvasu, the nations of the south of India:\nthe series is Varuttha, (Karutthama, Brahma), \xc3\x81ndira (\xc3\x81krira, Brahma); whose\nsons are Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ya, Karn\xcc\x81at\xcc\x81a, Chola, Kerala; the Hari V. adds Kola, and the\nAgni very incorrectly Gandhara.\n\n[442:5](vp109.htm#fr_1188) The curse alluded to is the failure of his line\n(Prajasamuchcheda), denounced upon Turvasu as the punishment of refusing to\ntake his father's infirmities upon him (see [p. 414](vp103.htm#page_414)). He\nwas also sentenced to rule over savages and barbarians, Mlechchhas, or people\nnot Hindus. The Mahabharata adds that the Yavanas sprang from Turvasu. As\nsovereign of the southeast, he should be the ancestor of the people of\nArracan, Ava, &c.; but the authorities cited in the preceding note refer the\nnations of the Peninsula to him, and consequently consider them as Mlechchhas.\nManu also places the Draviras or Tamuls amongst Mlechchhas; and these and\nsimilar passages indicate a period prior to the introduction of Hinduism into\nthe south of India.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVII](vp110.htm)\n\n"
