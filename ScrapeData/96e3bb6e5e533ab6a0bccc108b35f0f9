A true\nYogi must be pure, chaste, spotless, self-sacrificing, and the absolute master\nof himself. Humility, unostentatiousness, forgiveness, uprightness, and\nfirmness of purpose must adorn his character. A true Yogi\'s mind should not be\nattached to sense-objects or sense-pleasures. He should be free from egotism,\npride, vanity, and earthly ambition. Seeing the ephemeral nature of the\nphenomenal world, and reflecting upon the misery, suffering, sorrow, and\ndisease\n\np. 164\n\nwith which our earthly existence is beset, he should renounce his attachment\nto external things, which produce but fleeting sensations of pleasure, and\nshould overcome all that clinging to worldly life which is so strong in\nordinary mortals.\n\nA true Yogi does not feel happy when he is in the company of worldly-minded\npeople who live on the sense plane like animals. He is not bound by family\nties. He does not claim that this is his wife and these are his children; but,\non the contrary, having realized that each individual soul, being a child of\nImmortal Bliss, belongs to the Divine Family, he severs all family relations\nand worldly connections and thus becomes absolutely free. A true Yogi must\nalways preserve his equanimity in the face of the unpleasant as well as of the\npleasant experiences of life; and rising above good and evil he should remain\n\np. 165\n\nundisturbed by the success or failure, the victory or defeat, which may come\nto him as the result of the actions of his body and mind.\n\nA true Yogi, again, must have unswerving devotion to the Supreme Spirit, the\nAlmighty and Omniscient Soul of our souls; and realizing that his body and\nmind are the playground of the omnipotent Cosmic will, be should resign his\nindividual will to the universal, and should be ever ready to work for others,\nto live for others, and to die for others. All his works, so long as he is in\nthe society of people, should be a free offering to the world for the good of\nhumanity; but at other times he should resort to secluded places and live\nalone, constantly applying his mind to the highest spiritual wisdom that can\nbe obtained in the state of superconsciousness, through meditation on the\noneness of the\n\np. 166\n\nindividual soul with God, the Universal Spirit.\n\nA true Yogi must see the same Divinity dwelling in all living creatures. He\nshould also love all human beings equally. He should have neither friend nor\nfoe in the ordinary sense of those terms. A true Yogi is illumined by the\nlight of Divine Wisdom, therefore nothing remains unknown to him. Time and\nspace cannot limit the knowledge and wisdom of a true Yogi. Past and future\nevents will appear to him like things happening before his eyes. For him the\nlight of divine wisdom has dispelled the darkness of ignorance, which prevents\none from realizing the true nature of the soul, and which makes one selfish,\nwicked, and sinful. All psychic and spiritual powers serve him as their real\nmaster. Whatever he says is sure to come to pass. He never utters a word in\nvain.\n\np. 167\n\n[paragraph continues] If he says to a distressed or suffering person, "Be thou\nwhole," instantly that person will become whole.\n\nThe powers of a true Yogi are unlimited, there is nothing in the world that he\ncannot do. Indeed, he alone has free access to the storehouse of infinite\npowers; but he never draws therefrom any force merely to satisfy idle\ncuriosity, or to gratify selfish motives, or to gain wealth and fame, or to\nget any return whatsoever. He does not seek worldly prosperity, and always\nremains unconcerned about the result of his works. Praise or censure does not\ndisturb the peace of his mind. Angels or bright spirits and the spirits of\nancestors rejoice in his company and adore him. A true Yogi is worshipped by\nall. Having neither home nor possessions of his own, he wanders from place to\nplace, realizing that the canopy of heaven is the roof of his\n\np. 168\n\nworld-wide home. He is easily pleased by everybody irrespective of his caste,\ncreed, or nationality, and with a loving heart he blesses those who rebuke or\ncurse him. If his body be tortured or cut in pieces, he takes no revenge, but,\non the contrary, prays for the welfare of his persecutor. Such is the\ncharacter of a true Yogi.\n\nFrom ancient times there have been many such true Yogis in India and other\ncountries. The descriptions of their lives and deeds are furthermore as\nwonderful and as authentic as the life and acts of that illustrious Son of Man\nwho preached in Galilee nearly two thousand years ago. The powers and works of\nthis meek, gentle, and self-sacrificing Divine man, who is worshipped\nthroughout Christendom as the ideal Incarnation of God and the Saviour of\nmankind, have proved that he was a perfect type of one who is called in\n\np. 169\n\n[paragraph continues] India a true Yogi. Jesus the Christ has been recognized\nby his disciples and followers not only as an exceptionally unique character\nbut as the only-begotten Son of God; and it is quite natural for those who\nknow nothing about the lives and deeds of similar ideal characters of great\nYogis and Incarnations of God who have flourished at different times both\nbefore and after the Christian era, to believe that no one ever reached such\nspiritual heights or attained to such realization of oneness with the Heavenly\nFather as did Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nThe greater portion of the life of Jesus is absolutely unknown to us; and as\nHe did not leave behind Him any systematic teaching regarding the method by\nwhich one may attain to that state of God-consciousness which He Himself\nreached, there is no way of finding out what He did or practiced during the\neighteen years that\n\np. 170\n\nelapsed before His appearance in public. It is, therefore, extremely difficult\nto form a clear conception of what path He adopted. But we can imagine that,\nbeing born with unusually developed spiritual inclinations, He must have\ndevoted his life and time to such practices as led Him to the realization of\nabsolute Truth and to the attainment of divine consciousness, which ultimately\ngave Him a place among the greatest spiritual leaders of the world as well as\namong the disinterested Saviours of mankind.\n\nIndia is the only country where not only a complete system of practices is to\nbe found, but also a perfect method, by following which well-qualified\naspirants can attain to Christhood or to that spiritual unfoldment and divine\nenlightenment which made Jesus of Nazareth stand before the world as the ideal\ntype of spiritual\n\np. 171\n\nperfection. By studying the lives, the acts, and the most systematic and\nscientific teachings of the great Yogis of India, and by faithfully following\ntheir example and precepts, an earnest disciple can, through the Yoga\npractices given in the various branches of the Vedanta philosophy, hope some\nday to become as perfect as the Son of Man. This assurance must be a comfort\nand a consolation to the soul that is struggling for the attainment of\nspiritual perfection in this life. One peculiarity, however, of the teachings\nof the great Yogis of India is that the acquirement of spiritual perfection is\nthe goal for all, and that each individual soul is bound, sooner or later, to\nbe perfect even as Christ was perfect. They claim that spiritual truths and\nspiritual laws are as universal as the truths and laws of the material world,\nand that the realization of these truths cannot\n\np. 172\n\nbe confined to any particular time, place, or personality. Consequently by\nstudying the Science of Yoga anyone can easily understand the higher laws and\nprinciples, an application of which will explain the mysteries connected with\nthe lives and deeds of saints, sages, or Incarnations of God, like Krishna,\nBuddha, or Christ.\n\nA genuine seeker after Truth does not limit his study to one particular\nexample, but looks for similar events in the lives of all the great ones, and\ndoes not draw any conclusion until he has discovered the universal law which\ngoverns them all. For instance, Jesus the Christ said, "I and my Father are\none." Did He alone say it, or did many others who lived before and after Him\nand who knew nothing of His sayings, utter similar expressions? Krishna\ndeclared, "I am the Lord of the universe." Buddha said, "I am the Absolute\n\np. 173\n\n[paragraph continues] Truth." A Mahometan Sufi says, "I am He"; while every\ntrue Yogi declares, "I am Brahman." So long as we do not understand the\nprinciple that underlies such sayings, they seem mysterious to us and we\ncannot grasp their real meaning; but when we have realized the true nature of\nthe individual soul, and its relation to the universal Spirit, or God, or\nFather in Heaven, or the Absolute Truth, we have learned the principle and\nthere is no further mystery about it. We are then sure that whosoever reaches\nthis state of spiritual oneness or God-consciousness will express the same\nthought in a similar manner. Therefore if we wish to understand the character\nand miraculous deeds of Jesus of Nazareth, the surest way open to us is the\nstudy of the Science of Yoga and the practice of its methods.\n\nThis Science of Yoga, as has already\n\np. 174\n\nbeen stated, explains all mysteries, reveals the causes of all miracles, and\ndescribes the laws which govern them. It helps us to unravel the secrets of\nnature and to discover the origin of such phenomena as are called miraculous.\nAll miracles like "walking on the sea," "feeding a multitude with a small\nquantity of food," "raising the dead," which we read of in the life of Jesus,\nare described by the Yogis as manifestations of the powers that are acquired\nthrough long practice of Yoga. These powers are not supernatural; on the\ncontrary, they are in nature, are governed by natural though higher laws, and\nare therefore universal. When these laws are understood, that which is\nordinarily called miraculous by ignorant people, appears to be the natural\nresult of finer forces working on a higher plane. There is no such thing as\nthe absolutely supernatural. If\n\np. 175\n\na person\'s conception of nature be very limited, that which exists beyond that\nlimit will seem to him supernatural, while to another, whose idea of nature is\nbroader, the same thing will appear perfectly natural; therefore that miracle,\nor that particular act which is classed as a miracle by a Christian, can be\nexplained by a Yogi as the result of higher or finer forces of nature. Why?\nBecause his conception of nature is much wider than that of an ordinary man.\nWe must not forget that nature is infinite, and that there are circles within\ncircles, grades beyond grades, planes after planes, arranged in infinite\nsuccession; and the desire of a Yogi is to learn all the laws which govern\nthese various planes, and to study every manifestation of force, whether fine\nor gross. His mind is not satisfied with the knowledge of one particular plane\n\np. 176\n\nof existence; his aim is to comprehend the whole of nature.\n\nThose who have read the gospel of Buddha, by Paul Carus, will remember that,\nfive hundred years before the birth of Jesus the Christ, Shariputra, Buddha\'s\nillustrious disciple, walked on the surface of the water across a mighty river\nnamed Shravasti. A similar account of crossing a wide river by walking on the\nwater, we find in the life of Padmapada, the disciple of Sankaracharya, the\nbest exponent of the Vedanta philosophy, who lived about 600 A.D. Krishna, the\nHindu Christ, whose other name is Lord of the Yogis, raised the dead nearly\nfourteen hundred years before the advent of Christ. The transfiguration of\nKrishna is likewise most beautifully described in the tenth and eleventh\nchapters of the "Song Celestial," and, like Christ, he also fed a vast\nmultitude\n\np. 177\n\nof people with a small quantity of food. There are other instances of similar\npowers shown by great Yogis who came later; and these accounts are in every\nway as historical and as authentic as those of Jesus the Christ. Thus we see\nthat all the miracles performed by Jesus are to be found as well in the lives\nof Hindu Yogis, who lived both before and after Him.\n\nSo long as an event is isolated it appears supernatural and miraculous; but if\nwe see the same thing happening elsewhere under similar conditions, it assumes\nthe aspect of a natural occurrence governed by natural law, and then comes a\nproper solution of the mystery as well as the rational explanation of that\nwhich was called a miracle. It is in this that the Science of Yoga renders\nespecial service to the world, for more than any science it helps to reveal\nthe secrets of nature and\n\np. 178\n\nto explain the causes of all miraculous deeds.\n\nA true Yogi goes to the source of all power and of all forces, studies the\nlaws behind them, and learns the method of controlling them. He knows that the\nvarious forces of nature are but expressions of one universal, living,\nintelligent energy, which is called in Sanskrit "Prana." He sees that all the\nforces of physical nature, like heat, gravitation, electricity, as also all\nmental forces such as mind, intellect, thought, are nothing but the\nmanifestations of that one living self-existent force, "Prana." This\nintelligent energy projects from its bosom innumerable suns, moons, stars, and\nplanets into physical space. It has hurled this earth from the molten furnace\nof the sun, it has cooled it, bathed it in air and water, and clothed it with\nvegetable and animal life;\n\np. 179\n\nit wings the atmosphere with clouds and spans the planes with rivers, it takes\na fine minute substance and transforms it into something huge and gross; it\nmoves the body, gives life and motion to every atom and molecule, and at the\nsame time manifests itself as thought and intellect.\n\nWhy should it be impossible for one who has realized his oneness with this\nfountain-head of all power, who has learned the method of controlling all\nphenomena by comprehending the laws which govern them, and who has become the\nmaster of the world as was Jesus the Christ, to perform simple phenomena like\nwalking on the sea, turning water into wine, or raising the dead? According to\na true Yogi these acts of Jesus the Christ were only a few expressions of the\nYoga powers which have been exercised over and over again by the Yogis in\nIndia. Thus we understand that\n\np. 180\n\n[paragraph continues] Christ was one of these great Yogis born in a Semitic\nfamily.\n\nJesus was a great Yogi because He realized the transitory and ephemeral nature\nof the phenomenal world, and, discriminating the real from the unreal,\nrenounced all desire for worldly pleasures and bodily comforts. Like a great\nYogi He lived a life of seclusion, cutting off all connections with earthly\nfriends and relatives, and having neither home nor possessions of His own.\n\nJesus the Christ was a great Karma Yogi, because He never worked for results;\nHe had neither desire for name nor ambition for fame or for earthly\nprosperity. His works were a free offering to the world. He labored for\nothers, devoted His whole life to help others, and in the end died for others.\nBeing unattached to the fruits of His actions, He worked incessantly\n\np. 181\n\nfor the good of His fellow-men, directing them to the path of righteousness\nand spiritual realization through unselfish works. He understood the law of\naction and reaction, which is the fundamental principle of Karma Yoga, and it\nwas for this reason that He declared, "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he\nalso reap."\n\nJesus of Nazareth proved Himself to be a great Bhakti Yogi, a true lover of\nGod, by His unswerving devotion and His whole-hearted love for the Heavenly\nFather. His unceasing prayers, incessant supplications, constant meditation,\nand unflinching self-resignation to the will of the Almighty made Him shine\nlike a glorious morning-star in the horizon of love and devotion of a true\nBhakti Yogi. Christ showed wonderful self-control and mastery over His mind\nthroughout the trials and sufferings\n\np. 182\n\nwhich were forced upon Him. His sorrow, agony, and self-surrender at the time\nof His death as well as before His crucifixion, are conclusive proofs that He\nwas a human being with those divine qualities which adorn the soul of a true\nBhakti Yogi. It is true that His soul labored for a while under the heavy\nburden of His trials and sufferings; it is also true that He felt that His\npain was becoming wellnigh unbearable when He cried aloud three times, praying\nto the Lord, "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me."\n\nBut He found neither peace nor consolation until He could absolutely resign\nHis will to that of the Father and could say from the bottom of His heart,\n"Thy will be done." Complete self-surrender and absolute self-resignation are\nthe principal virtues of Bhakti Yoga, and as Christ possessed these to\nperfection up to the last\n\np. 183\n\nmoment of His life, He was a true Bhakti Yogi.\n\nLike the great Raja Yogis in India, Jesus knew the secret of separating His\nsoul from His physical shell, and He showed this at the time of His death,\nwhile His body was suffering from extreme pain, by saying, "Father, forgive\nthem, for they know not what they do." It is quite an unusual event to see one\nimploring forgiveness for his persecutors while dying on the cross, but from a\nYogi\'s point of view it is both possible and natural. Ramakrishna, the\ngreatest Yogi of the nineteenth century, whose life and sayings have been\nwritten by Max Muller, was once asked, "How could Jesus pray for His\npersecutors when He was in agony on the cross?" Ramakrishna answered by an\nillustration: "When the shell of an ordinary green cocoanut is pierced\n\np. 184\n\nthrough, the nail enters the kernel of the nut too. But in the case of the dry\nnut the kernel becomes separate from the shell, and so when the shell is\npierced, the kernel is not touched. Jesus was like the dry nut, i.e., His\ninner soul was separate from His physical shell, and consequently the\nsufferings of the body did not affect him." 1 Therefore He could pray for the\nforgiveness of His persecutors even when His body was suffering; and all true\nYogis are able to do the same. There have been many instances of Yogis whose\nbodies have been cut into pieces, but their souls never for a moment lost that\npeace and equanimity which enabled Jesus to forgive and bless His persecutors.\nBy this Christ proved that, like other Yogis, His soul was completely\nemancipated from the bondage\n\np. 185\n\nof the body and of the feelings. Therefore Christ was a Yogi.\n\nThrough the path of devotion and love Jesus attained to the realization of the\noneness of the individual soul with the Father or the Universal Spirit, which\nis the ideal of a Jnana Yogi as well as the ultimate goal of all religions. A\nJnana Yogi says: "I am He"; "I am Brahman"; "I am the Absolute Truth"; "I am\none with the Supreme Deity." By good works, by devotion, love, concentration,\ncontemplation, long fasting, and prayer, Jesus the Christ realized that His\nsoul was one with God, therefore He may be said to have attained the ideal of\nJnana Yoga.\n\nLike Krishna, Buddha, and all other great Yogis of India, Jesus healed the\nsick, opened the eyes of the blind, made the lame walk, and read the secret\nthoughts of His disciples. He knew exactly what Judas\n\np. 186\n\nand Peter were going to do; but there was nothing supernatural in any of His\nactions, there was nothing that cannot be done again over and over by a true\nYogi, and there was nothing in His life that cannot be explained rationally by\nthe Science of Yoga and the Philosophy of Vedanta. Without the help of this\nscience and this philosophy Jesus the Christ cannot be fully understood and\nappreciated. By studying His character, on the other hand, in the light of the\nVedanta Philosophy we shall be able not only to understand Him better, but to\nhave a larger appreciation of His true glory.\n\nMaterial science now scoffs at His miracles, but they are corroborated by the\nScience of Yoga and confirmed by the deeds of the great Yogis of India. No\ndevout Christian need for a moment fear that physical science can ever\nundermine\n\np. 187\n\nthe work of Jesus so long as the Science of Yoga is there to sustain all that\nHe did. Let him study the character of Jesus through the Philosophy of Vedanta\nand I am sure that he will understand Him better and be a truer Christian, a\nmore genuine disciple of the Son of Man than ever before. Let him follow the\nteachings of Yoga and he will some day become perfect like Christ.\n\nIt is through the teachings of Vedanta that the Hindus have learned how to\nglorify the character of Jesus; so also it is through Vedanta that a Christian\nwill learn to adore the great Yogis like Krishna, Buddha, Ramakrishna, and\nothers. It is through Vedanta that a Christian will be able to see how\nDivinity dwells in all animate and inanimate objects, and thus comprehending\nthe true relation of the individual soul to the Supreme Spirit,\n\np. 188\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[184:1](hby11.htm#fr_6) See "The Life and Sayings of Ramakrishna," by Prof. F.\nMax Muller.
