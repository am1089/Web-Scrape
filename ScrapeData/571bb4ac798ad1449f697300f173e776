It formed part of the Persian translation, was rendered into\nEnglish by Rammohun Roy, and has since been frequently quoted by English,\nFrench, and German writers as one of the most perfect specimens of the mystic\nphilosophy and poetry of the ancient Hindus.\n\nIt was in the year 1845 that I first copied at Berlin the text of this\nUpanishad, the commentary of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara (MS. 127 Chambers 1), and the gloss of\nGopalayogin (MS. 224 Chambers). The text and commentary of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara and the\ngloss of \xc3\x82nandagiri have since been edited by Dr. Roer in the Bibliotheca\nIndica, with translation and notes. There are other translations, more or less\nperfect, by Rammohun Roy, Windischmann, Poley, Weber, Muir, Regnaud, Gough,\nand others. But there still remained many difficult and obscure portions, and\nI hope that in some at least of the passages where I differ from my\npredecessors, not excepting _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, I may have succeeded in rendering the\noriginal meaning of the author more intelligible than it has hitherto been.\n\nThe text of the Ka _th_ a-upanishad is in some MSS. ascribed to the Ya _g_ ur-\nveda. In the Chambers MS. of the commentary also it is said to belong to that\nVeda 2, and in the Muktikopanishad it stands first among the Upanishads of the\nBlack Ya _g_ ur-veda. According to Colebrooke (Miscellaneous Essays, 1, 96,\nnote) it is referred to the Sama-veda also. Generally, however, it is counted\nas one of the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ a Upanishads.\n\nThe reason why it is ascribed to the Ya _g_ ur-veda, is probably because the\nlegend of Na _k_ iketas occurs in the Brahma _n_ a of the Taittiriya Ya _g_\nur-veda. Here we read (III, 1, 8):\n\nVa _g_ a _s_ ravasa, wishing for rewards, sacrificed all his\n\np. xxii\n\nwealth. He had a son, called Na _k_ iketas. While he was still a boy, faith\nentered into him at the time when the cows that were to be given (by his\nfather) as presents to the priests, were brought in. He said: 'Father, to whom\nwilt thou give me?' He said so a second and third time. The father turned\nround and said to him: 'To Death, I give thee.'\n\nThen a voice said to the young Gautama, as he stood up: 'He (thy father) said,\nGo away to the house of Death, I give thee to Death.' Go therefore to Death\nwhen he is not at home, and dwell in his house for three nights without\neating. If he should ask thee, 'Boy, how many nights hast thou been here?'\nsay, 'Three.' When he asks thee, 'What didst thou eat the first night?' say,\n'Thy offspring.' 'What didst thou eat the second night?' say, 'Thy cattle.'\n'What didst thou eat the third night?' say, 'Thy good works.'\n\nHe went to Death, while he was away from home, and lie dwelt in his house for\nthree nights without eating. When Death returned, he asked: 'Boy, how many\nnights hast thou been here?' He answered: 'Three.' 'What didst thou eat the\nfirst night?' 'Thy offspring.', 'What didst thou eat the second night?' 'Thy\ncattle.' 'What didst thou eat the third night?' 'Thy good works.'\n\nThen he said: 'My respect to thee, O venerable sir! Choose a boon.'\n\n'May I return living to my father,' he said.\n\n'Choose a second boon.'\n\n'Tell me how my good works may never perish.'\n\nThen he explained to him this Nakiketa fire (sacrifice), and hence his good\nworks do not perish.\n\n'Choose a third boon.'\n\n'Tell me the conquest of death again.'\n\nThen he explained to him this (chief) Nakiketa fire (sacrifice), and hence he\nconquered death again 1.\n\nThis story, which in the Brahma _n_ a is told in order to explain the name of\na certain sacrificial ceremony called\n\np. xxiii\n\n[paragraph continues] Nakiketa, was used as a peg on which to hang the\ndoctrines of the Upanishad. In its original form it may have constituted one\nAdhyaya only, and the very fact of its division into two Adhyayas may show\nthat the compilers of the Upanishad were still aware of its gradual origin. We\nhave no means, however, of determining its original form, nor should we even\nbe justified in maintaining that the first Adhyaya ever existed by itself, and\nthat the second was added at a much later time. Whatever its component\nelements may have been before it was an Upanishad, when it was an Upanishad it\nconsisted of six Vallis, neither more nor less.\n\nThe name of valli, lit. creeper, as a subdivision of a Vedic work, is\nimportant. It occurs again in the Taittiriya Upanishads. Professor Weber\nthinks that valli, creeper, in the sense of chapter, is based on a modern\nmetaphor, and was primarily intended for a creeper, attached to the _s_ akhas\nor branches of the Veda 1. More likely, however, it was used in the same sense\nas parvan, a joint, a shoot, a branch, i.e. a division.\n\nVarious attempts have been made to distinguish the more modern from the more\nancient portions of our Upanishad 2. No doubt there are peculiarities of\nmetre, grammar, language, and thought which indicate the more primitive or the\nmore modern character of certain verses. There are repetitions which offend\nus, and there are several passages which are clearly taken over from other\nUpanishads, where they seem to have had their original place. Thirty-five\nyears ago, when I first worked at this Upanishad, I saw no difficulty in re-\nestablishing what I thought the original text of the Upanishad must have been.\nI now feel that we know so little of the time and the circumstances when these\nhalf-prose and half-metrical Upanishads were first put together, that I should\nhesitate\n\np. xxiv\n\nbefore expunging even the most modern-sounding lines from the original context\nof these Vedantic essays 1.\n\nThe mention of Dhat _ri_ , creator, for instance (Ka _th_. Up. II, 20), is\ncertainly startling, and seems to have given rise to a very early conjectural\nemendation. But dhat _ri_ and vidhat _ri_ occur in the hymns of the Rig-veda\n(X, 82, 2), and in the Upanishads (Maitr. Up. VI, 8); and Dhat _ri_ , as\nalmost a personal deity, is invoked with Pra _g_ apati in Rig-veda X, 184, I.\nDeva, in the sense of God (Ka _th_. Up. II, 12), is equally strange, but\noccurs in other Upanishads also (Maitr. Up. VI, 23; _S_ veta _s_ v. Up. I, 3).\nMuch might be said about setu, bridge (Ka _th_. Up. III, 2; Mu _n_ _d_. Up.\nII, 2, 5), adar _s_ a, mirror (Ka _th_. Up. VI, 5), as being characteristic of\na later age. But setu is not a bridge, in our sense of the word, but rather a\nwall, a bank, a barrier, and occurs frequently in other Upanishads (Maitr. Up.\nVII. 7; Kha _n_ _d_. Up. VIII, 4; B _ri_ h. Up. IV, 4, 22, &c.), while adar\n_s_ as, or mirrors, are mentioned in the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka and the\nSrauta-sutras. Till we know something more about the date of the first and the\nlast composition or compilation of the Upanishads, how are we to tell what\nsubjects and what ideas the first author or the last collector was familiar\nwith? To attempt the impossible may seem courageous, but it is hardly\nscholarlike.\n\nWith regard to faulty or irregular readings, we can never know whether they\nare due to the original composers, the compilers, the repeaters, or lastly the\nwriters of the Upanishads. It is easy to say that adre _s_ ya (Mu _n_ _d_. Up.\nI, 1, 6) ought to be ad _ri_ sya; but who would venture to correct that form?\nWhenever that verse is quoted, it is quoted with adresya, not adrisya. The\ncommentators themselves tell us sometimes that certain forms are either Vedic\nor due to carelessness (pramadapa _th_ a); but that very fact shows that such\na form, for instance, as samiyata (Kha _n_ _d_. Up. I, 12, 3) rests on an old\nauthority.\n\nNo doubt, if we have the original text of an author, and can prove that his\ntext was corrupted by later compilers\n\np. xxv\n\nor copyists or printers, we have a right to remove those later alterations,\nwhether they be improvements or corruptions. But where, as in our case, we can\nnever hope to gain access to original documents, and where we can only hope,\nby pointing out what is clearly more modem than the rest or, it may be,\nfaulty, to gain an approximate conception of what the original composer may\nhave had in his mind, before handing his composition over to the safe keeping\nof oral tradition, it is almost a duty to discourage, as much as lies in our\npower, the work of reconstructing an old text by so-called conjectural\nemendations or critical omissions.\n\nI have little doubt, for instance, that the three verses 16-18 in the first\nValli of the Ka _th_ a-upanishad are later additions, but I should not\ntherefore venture to remove them. Death had granted three boons to Na _k_\niketas, and no more. In a later portion, however, of the Upanishad (II, 3),\nthe expression s _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85ka vittamayi occurs, which I have translated by 'the\nroad which leads to wealth.' As it is said that Na _k_ iketas did not choose\nthat s _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85ka, some reader must have supposed that a s _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85ka was offered\nhim by Death. S _ri_ \xe1\xb9\x85ka, however, meant commonly a string or necklace, and\nhence arose the idea that Death must have offered a necklace as an additional\ngift to Na _k_ iketas. Besides this, there was another honour done to Na _k_\niketas by M _ri_ tyu, namely, his allowing the sacrifice which he had taught\nhim, to be called by his name. This also, it was supposed, ought to have been\ndistinctly mentioned before, and hence the insertion of the three verses\n16-18. They are clumsily put in, for after punar evaha, 'he said again,' verse\n16 ought not to have commenced by tam abravit, 'he said to him.' They contain\nnothing new, for the fact that the sacrifice is to be called after Na _k_\niketas was sufficiently indicated by verse 19, 'This, O Na _k_ iketas, is thy\nfire which leads to heaven, which thou hast chosen as thy second boon.' But so\nanxious was the interpolator to impress upon his hearers the fact that the\nsacrifice should in future go by that name, that, in spite of the metre, he\ninserted tavaiva, 'of thee alone,' in verse 19.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xxi:1](sbe15003.htm#fr_17) MS. 133 is a mere copy of MS. 127.\n\n[xxi:2](sbe15003.htm#fr_18) Ya _g_ urvede Ka _th_ avallibhashyam.\n\n[xxii:1](sbe15003.htm#fr_19) The commentator explains punar-m _ri_ tyu as the\ndeath that follows after the present inevitable death.\n\n[xxiii:1](sbe15003.htm#fr_20) History of Indian Literature, p. 93, note; p.\n157.\n\n[xxiii:2](sbe15003.htm#fr_21) Though it would be unfair to hold Professor\nWeber responsible for his remarks on this and other questions connected with\nthe Upanishads published many years ago (Indische Studien, 1853, p. 197), and\nthough I have hardly ever thought it necessary to criticise them, some of his\nremarks are not without their value even now.\n\n[xxiv:1](sbe15003.htm#fr_22) See Regnaud, Le Pessimisme Brahmanique, Annales\ndu Musee Guimet, 1880; tom. i, p. 101.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II: The Mundaka-Upanishad](sbe15004.htm)\n\n"
