The special havis, or sacrificial dishes,\nwere, at the ordinary full-moon sacrifice, a rice-cake (to Agni, and another)\nto Agni and Soma; and at the new-moors sacrifice, a cake (to Agni, and\nanother) to Indra and Agni, or, as an alternative, a dish of curds (sannayya)\nprepared of sweet and sour milk, offered to Indra (or Mahendra). The Dakshaya\n_n_ as, on the other hand, offered the Agni-Soma and Indra-Agni cakes in the\nfore-noon of the first day, that of full and new moon respectively. The\nafternoons of the same days were then taken up with preliminary rites, such as\nthe eating of fast-day food, the cutting of a pala _s_ a branch, driving away\nof the calves from the cows, &c. The second day's performance commences (after\nthe Agnihotra) with the election of the Brahman. The chief oblations of the\nday are (a cake to Agni, and) sour and sweet milk, offered separately to Indra\nat full moon; and mixed (as sannayya or payasya) to Mitra and Varu _n_ a at\nnew moon.\n\nAt full moon some authorities add a special ish _t_ i to Indra Vim _ri_ dh\n('the Averter of evil'). The new-moon performance concludes with libations of\nwhey to the divine coursers (the horses of the gods); and, optionally, with an\nish _t_ i to \xc3\x82ditya.\n\nThe performance of the Dakshaya _n_ a sacrifice was held to be obligatory only\nfor a period of fifteen years (see XI, 1, 2, 13), whereas the ordinary new and\nfull-moon offerings had to be performed for double that period from the\nsetting up of the sacred fires. Nay, even the daily performance of it with\ncertain modifications, for a whole year, was supposed to acquit the\nhouseholder of any further obligation in this respect; his sacrificial duties\nbeing henceforth limited to the performance of the Agnihotra, or morning and\nevening libations. The daily performance of the Dakshaya _n_ a is so regulated\nthat an afternoon and following forenoon are alternately assigned to the two\ndays' ceremonies of the ordinary fortnightly Dakshaya _n_ a sacrifice.\n\n2:4:4:11\\. In the beginning Pra _g_ apati, being desirous of offspring,\nsacrificed with this sacrifice: 'May I abound in offspring and cattle; may I\nobtain prosperity; may I become glorious; may I become an eater of food!' so\nhe thought.\n\n2:4:4:22\\. Now he was indeed Daksha: and because\n\np. 376\n\nhe sacrificed in the beginning with this sacrifice, it is called Dakshaya _n_\na-sacrifice. Some, however, call it the Vasish _th_ a-sacrifice; for he (Pra\n_g_ apati) is indeed vasish _th_ a (the best) 1, and after him they call it.\nHe sacrificed with that sacrifice; and what race, what prosperity of Pra _g_\napati was then produced through his performing that sacrifice, that same race\nhe procreates, that same prosperity he obtains, whosoever, knowing this,\nperforms that sacrifice: let him therefore perform that sacrifice.\n\n2:4:4:33\\. Now that same sacrifice was afterwards performed by Pratidar _s_ a\n_S_ vaikna; and he indeed was an authority 2 to those who emulated him. An\nauthority, therefore, he will become, whosoever, knowing this, performs that\nsacrifice: let him, therefore, perform that sacrifice.\n\n2:4:4:44\\. Him Suplan Sar _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya approached for the sake of sanctity; and\naccordingly he was taught that sacrifice and another 3; and having learnt it\nhe went back to the S _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ayas. Now they knew that he was coming to\nthem after studying the sacrifice for their sake. They said, 'Verily, with the\ngods (saha devai _h_ ) he has come to us who has come after studying the\nsacrifice:' thus he (was called) Sahadeva Sar _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ aya; and even now the\nsaying is, 'Lo, Suplan has taken another name!' He performed that sacrifice;\nand what race and prosperity of the S _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ayas was then produced\nthrough his performing that sacrifice, that same race he procreates, that same\nprosperity he obtains, whosoever,\n\np. 377\n\nknowing this, performs that sacrifice: let him, therefore, perform that\nsacrifice.\n\n2:4:4:55\\. That same sacrifice was afterwards performed by Devabhaga _S_\nrautarsha. He was Purohita both to the Kurus and the S _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ayas. Now\na very high position (is held by him) who is the Purohita of one kingdom: how\nmuch higher, then, is the position (of one) who (is the Purohita) of two\n(kingdoms). A very high position accordingly he obtains, whosoever, knowing\nthis, performs that sacrifice: let him, therefore, perform that sacrifice.\n\n2:4:4:66\\. That same sacrifice was afterwards performed by Daksha Parvati; and\neven to this day these (descendants of his) the Dakshaya _n_ as are possessed\nof the royal dignity: royal dignity he, therefore, here obtains, whosoever,\nknowing this, performs that sacrifice: let him, therefore, perform that\nsacrifice.--Day by day there is one cake 1: thereby Fortune ( _s_ ri) is\n(wedded) to him without a rival wife and undisturbed. He offers on two days of\nthe full moon and on two of the new moon: for two means a pair, so that a\nproductive pair is thereby obtained.\n\n2:4:4:77\\. Now when 2, at full moon, he offers a (cake) to Agni and Soma on\nthe first day,--these are two deities, and two means a pair: hence a\nproductive pair is thereby obtained.\n\n2:4:4:88\\. And on the morrow there are Agni's cake and Indra's Sannayya  3,--\nthese are two deities, and two means a pair, so that a productive pair is\nthereby obtained.\n\np. 378\n\n2:4:4:99\\. Again when, at new moon, he offers a (cake) to Indra and Agni on\nthe first day,--these are two deities, and two means a pair, so that a\nproductive pair is thereby obtained.\n\n2:4:4:1010\\. Then on the morrow there are Agni's cake and Mitra and Varu _n_\na's curds. Now Agni's cake (is offered), for the sole purpose that it may not\nforsake the sacrifice 1. Then those two, Mitra and Varu _n_ a, are two\ndeities, and two means a pair: hence a productive pair is thereby obtained;\nand thus is (produced) that form (of the sacrifice) whereby he becomes many,\nwhereby he is reproduced.\n\n2:4:4:1111\\. And when, at full moon, he offers the Agni-Soma (cake) on the\nfirst day, then this is for him that victim which they slaughter for Agni and\nSoma on the fast-day (of the Soma-sacrifice) 2.\n\n2:4:4:1212\\. And on the morrow there are Agni's cake and Indra's Sannayya. Now\nAgni's cake is for him what the morning libation is (at the Soma-sacrifice),\nfor the morning libation is indeed sacred to Agni; and the Sannayya is for him\nthe mid-day libation, for the mid-day libation is indeed sacred to Indra.\n\n2:4:4:1313\\. And again when, at new moon, he offers the Indra-Agni (cake) on\nthe first day, that is for him the same as the third (or evening) libation;\nfor the third libation is sacred to the All-gods, and Indra and Agni truly are\nall the gods 3.\n\n2:4:4:1414\\. And on the morrow there are Agni's cake and Mitra and Varu _n_\na's curds. Now Agni's cake is (offered) for the sole purpose that it should\nnot\n\np. 379\n\nforsake the sacrifice and that dish of curds (payasya) is to him the same as\nthat barren cow, the anubandhya, which has to be slaughtered for Mitra and\nVaru _n_ a (at the Soma-sacrifice) 1: thus. by performing the full and new-\nmoon offering one gains as much as is gained by performing a Soma-sacrifice;\nand that (offering) is indeed a great sacrifice.\n\n2:4:4:1515\\. And again when, at full moon, he offers the Agni-Soma (cake) on\nthe first day,--it was by that (offering) that Indra slew V _ri_ tra 2; it was\nthereby he gained that supreme authority which he now wields 3: and so does he\n(the sacrificer) thereby slay his wicked spiteful enemy and gain the\nsuperiority. And as to his mixing (sweet and sour milk),--the Sannayya is (the\noblation) of the new moon (ama-vasya) 4, and the new moon 5 means being far\naway: to him who had slain V _ri_ tra this was forthwith (offered), and him\nthey regaled with that draught. He therefore who, knowing this, prepares the\nSannayya at full moon, forthwith\n\np. 380\n\ndrives away evil. Now that moon doubtless is king Soma, the food of the gods:\nthey extract it on the first day, intending to consume it on the next day;\nconsequently when that (moon) wanes, it is being consumed by them.\n\n2:4:4:1616\\. And when, at full moon, he offers the Agni-Soma (cake) on the\nfirst day, he thereby (as it were) extracts that (Soma); and, when extracted,\nhe adds that juice to it, and makes it strong by means of that juice 1.\nWhosoever, then, knowing this, prepares the Sannayya at full moon, renders his\noffering palatable to the gods, and his offering is palatable to the gods.\n\n2:4:4:1717\\. And again as to why, at new moon, he offers the Indra-Agni (cake)\non the first day. Indra and Agni doubtless are the deities of the new and full\nmoon: it is to these, therefore, that he offers directly and expressly; and\ndirectly to the new and full moon is offering made by him who thus knows this.\n\n2:4:4:1818\\. And on the morrow there is Agni's cake and Mitra and Varu _n_ a's\ncurds. Now Agni's cake is (offered) for the sole purpose that it may not\nforsake the sacrifice. Mitra and Varu _n_ a, on the other hand, are the two\nhalf-moons: the waxing one is Varu _n_ a, and the waning one is Mitra. During\nthat night (of new moon) these two meet, and when they are thus together he\npleases them with that (cake-offering): and, verily, all is pleased with him,\nall is obtained by him who thus knows this.\n\n2:4:4:1919\\. In that same night Mitra implants seed in Varu _n_ a, and when it\n(the moon) wanes, then it is\n\np. 381\n\nproduced from that seed. Now as to why that oblation of curds (payasya) to\nMitra and Varu _n_ a is here exactly analogous (to the Sannayya offered at new\nmoon) 1.\n\n2:4:4:2020\\. The new moon doubtless is entitled to the Sannayya: it is\nprepared both then and at full moon. Now were he also here (at the full-moon\noffering) to mix together (the sweet and sour milk), he would commit a\nrepetition and cause a quarrel (between the respective gods) 2. Having\ncollected that (Soma or moon) from the waters and plants, he causes him to be\nborn from out of the oblations; and on being born from the oblations, he is\nvisible in the western (sky).\n\n2:4:4:2121\\. It is through union that he produces him: the curds (payasya,\nfem.) are female, and the whey is seed. Now what is produced by union is\n(produced) properly: hence he thereby produces him by a productive union; and\ntherefore there is an offering of curds.\n\np. 382\n\n2:4:4:2222\\. He then offers the whey 1 to the (divine) Coursers. Now the\nCoursers are the seasons, and the whey is seed: and thus the seed is cast\nproperly, and the seasons bring forth the seed so cast in the form of these\ncreatures. This is why he offers the whey to the Coursers.\n\n2:4:4:2323\\. He offers, as it were, behind the sacrifice: for it is from\nbehind that the male approaches and impregnates the female. He first offers in\nthe east. With 'O Agni, accept . . . !' he repeats the Vashat,--this is in\nlieu of the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t; and (the latter) 2 he offers in the east.\n\n2:4:4:2424\\. He then sprinkles (the whey) in the several quarters, with the\ntexts (Vag'. S. VI, 19 b-g), 'The quarters!--The fore-quarters (pra-di _s_ )!\n--The by-quarters (a-di _s_ )!--The intermediate quarters (vi-di _s_ )! The\nupper quarters (ud-di _s_ )!--To the quarters,--Svaha 3!' Five are the\nquarters, and five the\n\np. 383\n\nseasons: he thus effects a union between the quarters and the seasons 1.\n\n2:4:4:2525\\. Five partake of that (whey remaining in the spoon),--viz. the Hot\n_ri_ , the Adhvaryu, the Brahman, the \xc3\x82gnidhra, and the Sacrificer; for five\nare the seasons, so that the characteristic nature of the seasons is thereby\nobtained; and the seed that is cast is firmly implanted in the seasons. The\nsacrificer partakes of it first, thinking, 'May I first obtain seed!' But also\nlast (he partakes of it) 2, thinking, 'May seed remain in me last of all!' By\nsaying, 'Invited,--invite thou 3!' they make it (the whey to resemble) the\nSoma.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[374:2](sbe1255.htm#fr_836) See Weber, Ind. Stud.

In default of such a cow, an ox, or even a dish of curds (payasya)\nserves the same purpose. See Katy. _S_ r. X, 9, I2-15; _S_ at. Br. IV, 5, 2, 1\nseq.\n\n[379:2](sbe1255.htm#fr_847) See I, 6, 4, 1 2.\n\n[379:3](sbe1255.htm#fr_848) Thus the frequently-occurring phrase 'vya _g_\nayata yasyeyam vi _g_ itis tam' (literally, 'he conquered that conquest which\nis now theirs') has been translated throughout.\n\n[379:4](sbe1255.htm#fr_849) On the derivation of ama-vasya ('dwelling at home,\nor together'), see I, 6, 4, 3 seq.\n\n[379:5](sbe1255.htm#fr_850) Or, 'the dwelling at home,' or '(Indra's) dwelling\ntogether (with Agni) means (Indra, the V _ri_ tra-slayer) being far away.'\n\n[380:1](sbe1255.htm#fr_851) See I, 6, 4, 6 seq.\n\n[381:1](sbe1255.htm#fr_852) Or, to the offering of sour and sweet milk at full\nmoon; see next note. The Ka _n_ va text has: 'Now as to why the oblation of\ncurds is here made exactly analogous (at the full and new-moon ceremonies).'\nPerhaps it may also refer to the exact correspondence of the offering of curds\nto Mitra and Varu _n_ a at new moon and at the Soma-sacrifice.\n\n[381:2](sbe1255.htm#fr_853) At the new-moon offering of the Dakshaya _n_ a,\nthe sannayya or payasya offered to Mitra and Varu _n_ a is prepared in the\nordinary way (as at the new-moon ceremony), by fresh (boiled or un-boiled)\nmilk being added to the sour milk of the preceding night's milking. At the\nfull-moon offering, on the other hand, the sour and sweet milk remain\nseparate, and constitute two different havis, or sacrificial dishes, dedicated\nto Indra. The terms san-ni ('to bring together') and sannayya are here\nlikewise applied to the offering of the separate substances.\n\n[382:1](sbe1255.htm#fr_854) Before the oblations of curds are made, the whey\nis poured off into a vessel (then optionally sprinkled with butter), and\nplaced on the utkara, or heap of rubbish. After the stalk of grass has been\nthrown into the fire (see I, 8, 3, 19), or after the dismissal of the spoons\n(I, 8, 3, 27), the Adhvaryu takes the whey and sprinkles the barhis (the grass\ncovering on the altar) with it. He then pours the remaining whey into the _g_\nuhu spoon and calls on the Hot _ri_ to recite the invitatory prayer to the\nCoursers. Thereupon he betakes himself with the spoon to the north of the\nfire, calls on the Hot _ri_ for the offering-formula, and at the two\nconcluding Vasha _t_ s pours some of the whey into the east part of the fire.\nHe then sits down and sprinkles the whey on the fire according to the several\nquarters, beginning in the east, and moving around from left to right\n(pradakshi _n_ am), with the respective texts, Va _g_. S. VI, 19 b-e; after\nwhich he makes two more libations in the centre and east part of the fire,\nwith VI, 19 f and g.\n\n[382:2](sbe1255.htm#fr_855) The Ka _n_ va text has tadu instead of sa vai. On\nthe oblation to Agni as 'the maker of good offering,' see I, 7, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[382:3](sbe1255.htm#fr_856) Svaha is uttered after each formula,--'The\nquarters, Svaha!' &c.\n\n[383:1](sbe1255.htm#fr_857) _Ri_ tun evaitad digbhir mithunan karoti, Ka _n_\nva recension.\n\n[383:2](sbe1255.htm#fr_858) The author does not express himself quite clearly.\nThe sacrificer is to partake of the whey before the priests and also (or, as\nan alternative) after them. According to Katy. IV, 4, 26-27, the sacrificer is\nto eat either last of all, or first and last. The Ka _n_ va text has: Prathamo\nya _g_ amano bhakshayati prathamo reta _h_ parig _ri_ h _n_ amity athottamo\nmayy uttama _m_ reta _h_ pratitish _th_ ad iti,--accordingly he is to eat\nfirst and last.\n\n[383:3](sbe1255.htm#fr_859) Each of them, in his respective order, takes the\nspoon, calls on the others in the same order with 'O sacrificer (Hot _ri_ ,\nAdhvaryu, &c.) invite!' Their permission having been given by 'Invited (thou\nart)!' he then takes some of the whey, with one of the texts: 'I eat thee, the\ncourser (or whey, vaginam) of the seasons, the coursers!' 'I, the courser (or,\nmighty one) eat, invited, of the invited, to the whey.' 'May I be a racer in\nthe race!' Katy. IV, 4, 13-15.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 5, 1. Fifth Adhyaya.
