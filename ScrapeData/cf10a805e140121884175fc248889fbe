He bravely went through the\ndreadful cemetery to the sissoo tree, put the goblin on his shoulder, and\nstarted as before. And as he walked along, the goblin said to him: "O King, I\nam very tired with these comings and goings, but you do not seem to be. So I\nwill tell you my Great Puzzle. Listen."\n\n\n\nLong ago there was a king named Virtue in the southern country. He was the\nbest of righteous men, and was born in a great family. His wife came from the\nMalwa country, and her name was Moonlight. And they had one daughter, whom\nthey named Beauty.\n\nWhen this daughter was grown up, the relatives conspired to wreck the kingdom\nand drive King Virtue out. But he escaped by night, took a great many jewels,\nand fled from his kingdom with his beautiful wife and his daughter. He started\nfor his father-in-law\'s house in Malwa, and came with his wife and daughter to\nthe Vindhya forest. There they spent a weary night.\n\nIn the morning the blessed sun arose in the east, stretching out his rays like\nhands to warn the king not to go into the forest where robbers lived. The king\nwent on foot with his trembling daughter and his wife, and their feet were\nwounded by the thorny grass. So they came to a fortified village. It was like\nthe city of Death; for there were no righteous people there, and it was filled\nwith robber-men who killed and robbed other people.\n\nAs the king drew near with his fine garments and his gems, many robbers saw\nhim from a distance, and ran out armed to rob him. When the king saw them\ncoming, he said to his wife and daughter: "These are wild men. They must not\ntouch you. Go into the thick woods." So the queen with her daughter Beauty\nfled in fear into the middle of the forest.\n\nBut the brave king took his sword and shield and killed many of the wild men\nas they charged down, raining arrows on him. Then their leader gave an order,\nand all the robbers fell on the king at once, wounded every limb in his body,\nand killed him; for he was all alone. So the robbers took the jewels and went\naway.\n\nNow the queen had hidden in a thicket, and had seen her husband killed. Then\nshe fled a long distance in fear and came with her daughter into another thick\nwood. The rays of the midday sun were so fierce that travellers had to sit in\nthe shade. So Queen Moonlight and Princess Beauty sat down under an ashoka\ntree near a lotus-pond in terrible weariness and fear and grief.\n\nNow a gentleman named Fierce-lion who lived near came on horseback with his\nson into that wood to hunt. The son\'s name was Strong-lion. And the father saw\nthe footprints of the queen and the princess, and he said to his son: "My son,\nthese footprints are clean-cut and ladylike. Let us follow them. And if we\nfind two women, you shall marry one of them, whichever you choose."\n\nAnd the son Strong-lion said: "Father, the one who has the little feet in this\nline of footprints, seems to be the wife for me. The one with the bigger feet\nmust be older. She is the wife for you."\n\nBut Fierce-lion said: "My son, what do you mean? Your mother went to heaven\nbefore your eyes. When so good a wife is gone, how could I think of another?"\n\nBut his son said: "Not so, Father. A householder\'s house is an empty place\nwithout a wife. Besides, you have surely heard what the poet says:\n\nWhat fool would go into a house?  \nTis a prisoner\'s abode,  \nUnless a buxom wife is there,  \nLooking down the road.\'\n\nSo, Father, I beg you on my life to marry the second one, whom I have chosen\nfor you."\n\nThen Fierce-lion said "Very well," and went on slowly with his son, following\nthe footprints. And when he came to the pond, he saw Queen Moonlight, radiant\nwith beauty and charm. And with his son he eagerly approached her. But when\nshe saw him, she rose in terror, fearing that he was a robber.\n\nBut her sensible daughter said: "There is no reason to fear. These two men are\nnot robbers. They are two well-dressed gentlemen, who probably came here to\nhunt." Still the queen swung in doubt.\n\nThen Fierce-lion dismounted and stood before her. And he said: "Beautiful\nlady, do not be frightened. We came here to hunt. Pluck up heart and tell me\nwithout fear who you are. Why have you come into this lonely wood? For your\nappearance is that of ladies who wear gems and sit on pleasant balconies. And\nwhy should feet fit to saunter in a court, press this thorny ground? It is a\nstrange sight. For the wind-blown dust settles on your faces and robs them of\nbeauty. It hurts us to see the fierce rays of the sun fall upon such figures.\nTell us your story. For our hearts are sadly grieved to see you in such a\nplight. And we cannot see how you could live in a forest filled with wild\nbeasts."\n\nThen the queen sighed, and between shame and grief she stammered out her\nstory. And Fierce-lion saw that she had no husband to care for her. So he\ncomforted her and soothed her with tender words, and took care of her and her\ndaughter. His son helped the two ladies on horseback and led them to his own\ncity, rich as the city of the god of wealth. And the queen seemed to be in\nanother life. She was helpless and widowed and miserable. So she consented.\nWhat could she do, poor woman?\n\nThen, because the queen had smaller feet, the son Strong-lion married Queen\nMoonlight. And Fierce-lion, the father, married her daughter, the princess\nBeauty, because of the bigness of her feet. Who would break a promise that had\nbeen made solemnly?\n\nThus, because of their inconsistent feet, the daughter became the wife of the\nfather and the mother-in-law of her own mother. And the mother became the wife\nof the son and the daughter-in-law of her own daughter. And as time passed,\nsons and daughters were born to each pair.\n\n\n\nWhen the goblin had told this story, he asked the king: "O King, when children\nwere born to the father and daughter, and other children to the son and\nmother, what relation were those children to one another? If you know and do\nnot tell, then remember the curse I spoke of before?"\n\nWhen the king heard the goblin\'s question, he turned the thing this way and\nthat, but could not say a word. So he went on in silence. And when the goblin\nsaw that he could not answer the question, he laughed in his heart and\nthought: "This king cannot give an answer to my Great Puzzle. So he just walks\non in silence. And he cannot deceive me because of the power of the curse.\nWell, I am pleased with his wonderful character. So I will cheat that rogue of\na monk, and give the magic power he is striving after to this king."\n\nSo the goblin said aloud: "O King, you are weary with your comings and goings\nin this dreadful cemetery in the black night, yet you seem happy, and never\nhesitate at all. I am astonished and pleased at your perseverance. So now you\nmay take the dead body and go ahead. I will leave the body. And I will tell\nyou something that will do you good, and you must do it. The monk for whom you\nare carrying this body, is a rogue. He will call upon me and worship me, and\nhe will try to kill you as a sacrifice. He will say: Lie flat on the ground in\nan attitude of reverence.\' O King, you must say to that rascal: I do not know\nthis attitude of reverence. Show me first, and then I will do likewise.\' Then\nwhen he lies on the ground to show you the attitude of reverence, cut off his\nhead with your sword. Then you will get the kingship over the fairies which he\nis trying to get. Otherwise, the monk will kill you and get the  magic power.\nThat is why I have delayed you so long. Now go ahead, and win magic power."\n\nSo the goblin left the body on the king\'s shoulder and went away. And the king\nreflected how the monk Patience was planning to hurt him. He took the body and\njoyfully went to the fig-tree.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Conclusion](ttg24.htm)\n\n'
