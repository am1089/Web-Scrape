It may be styled a Dharma-sutra, though this\nancient title of the Sutra works on law has been preserved in the MSS. of\nthose Sm _ri_ tis only, which have been handed down, like the Dharma-sutras of\n\xc3\x82pastamba, Baudhayana, and Hira _n_ yake _s_ in, as parts of the respective\nKalpa-sutras, to which they belong. The size of the Vish _n_ u-sutra, and the\ngreat variety of the subjects treated in it, would suffice to entitle it to a\nconspicuous place among the five or six existing Dharma-sutras; but it\npossesses a peculiar claim to interest, which is founded on its close\nconnection with one of the oldest Vedic schools, the Ka _th_ as, on the one\nhand, and with the famous code of Manu and some other ancient law-codes, on\nthe other hand. To discuss these two principal points, and some minor points\nconnected with them, as fully as the limits of an introduction admit of, will\nbe the more necessary, because such a discussion can afford the only safe\nbasis for a conjecture not altogether unsupported regarding the time and place\nof the original composition of this work, and may even tend to throw some new\nlight on the vexed question as to the origin of the code of Manu. Further on I\nshall have to speak of the numerous interpolations traceable in the Vish _n_\nu-sutra, and a few remarks regarding the materials\n\n[1. This was first pointed out by Professor Max Muller, History of Ancient\nSanskrit Literature, p. 134. His results were confirmed and expanded by the\nsubsequent researches of Dr. Buhler, Introduction to Bombay Digest, I, p.\nxxii; Indian Antiquary, V, p. 30; Kasmir Report, p. 36.]\n\np. x\n\nused for this translation, and the principles of interpretation that have been\nfollowed in it, may be fitly reserved for the last.\n\n   There is no surer way for ascertaining the particular Vedic school by which\nan ancient Sanskrit law-book of unknown or uncertain origin was composed, than\nby examining the quotations from, and analogies with, Vedic works which it\ncontains. Thug the Gautama Dharma _s_ astra might have originated in any one\namong the divers Gautama Kara _n_ as with which Indian tradition acquaints us.\nBut the comparatively numerous passages which its author has borrowed from the\nSa _m_ hita and from one Brahma _n_ a of the Sama-veda prove that it must\nbelong to one of those Gautama Kara _n_ as who studied the Sama-veda[1].\nRegarding the code of Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya we learn from tradition that a Vedic\nteacher of that name was the reputed author of the White Ya _g_ ur-veda. But\nthis coincidence might be looked upon as casual, if the Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya-sm\n_ri_ ti did not contain a number of Mantras from that Vedic Sa _m_ hita, and a\nnumber of very striking analogies, in the section on funeral ceremonies\nparticularly, with the G _ri_ hya-sutra of the Va _g_ asaneyins, the Katiya G\n_ri_ hya-sutra of Paraskara[2]. In the case of the Vish _n_ u-sutra an enquiry\nof this kind is specially called for, because tradition leaves us entirely in\nthe dark as to its real author. The fiction that the laws promulgated in\nChapters II-XCVII were communicated by the god Vish _n_ u to the goddess of\nthe earth, is of course utterly worthless for historical purposes; and all\nthat it can be made to show is that those parts of this work in which it is\nstarted or kept up cannot rival the laws themselves in antiquity.\n\n   Now as regards, first, the Vedic Mantras and Pratikas (beginnings of\nMantras) quoted in this work, it is necessary to leave aside, as being of no\nmoment for the present purpose, 1. very well-known Mantras, or, speaking more\n\n[1. See Buhler, Introduction to Gautama (Vol. II of the Sacred Books of the\nEast), pp. xlv-xlviii.\n\n2\\. Buhler, Introduction to Digest, p. xxxii; Stenzler, On Paraskara's G _ri_\nhya-sutra, in the journal of the German Oriental Society, VII, p. 527 seq.]\n\np. xi\n\nprecisely, all such Mantras as are frequently quoted in Vedic works of divers\n_S_ akhas; 2. the purificatory texts enumerated under the title of Sarva-veda-\npavitra _n_ i in LVI. The latter can afford us no help in determining the\nparticular _S_ akha to which this work belongs, because they are actually\ntaken, as they profess to be, from all the Vedas indiscriminately, and because\nnearly the whole of Chapter LVI is found in the Vasish _th_ a-sm _ri_ ti as\nwell (see further on), which probably does not belong to the same Veda as this\nwork. Among the former class of Mantras may be included, particularly, the\nGayatri, the Purushasukta, the Aghamarsha _n_ a, the Kushma _nd_ is, the Vyah\n_ri_ tis, the Gyesh _th_ a Samans, the Rudras, the Tri _n_ a _k_ iketa, the\nTrisupar _n_ a, the Vaish _n_ ava, _S_ akra, and Barhaspatya Mantras mentioned\nin XC, 3, and the Mantra quoted in XXVIII, 51 (= Gautama's 'Retasya'). Among\nthe twenty-two Mantras quoted in Chapters XLVIII, LXIV, LXV (including\nrepetitions, but excluding the Purushasukta, Gayatri, Aghamarsha _n_ a) there\nare also some which may be referred to this class, and the great majority of\nthem occur in more than one Veda at the same time. But it is worthy of note\nthat no less than twelve, besides occurring in at least one other Sakha, are\neither actually found in the Sa _m_ hita of the Karaya _n_ iya-ka _th_ as, the\nKa _th_ aka[1] (or _K_ araka-sakha?), or stated to belong to it in the\nCommentary, while one is found in the Kathaka alone, a second in the Atharva-\nveda alone, a third in the Taittiriya Brahma _n_ a alone, and a fourth does\nnot occur in any Vedic work hitherto known[2]. A far greater number of Mantras\noccurs in Chapters XXI, LXVII, LXXIII, LXXIV, LXXXVI, which treat of daily\noblations, _S_ raddhas, and the ceremony of setting a bull at liberty. Of all\nthese Mantras, which,--including the Purushasukta and other such well-known\nMantras as well as the short invocations addressed to Soma, Agni, and other\ndeities, but excluding the invocations addressed to Vish _n_ u in the spurious\nSutra, LXVII, 2,--are more than a hundred in number, no more than forty or so\nare found in Vedic\n\n[1. In speaking of this work I always refer to the Berlin MS.\n\n2\\. XLVIII, 10. Cf., however, Va _g_ as. Sa _m_ h. IV, 12.]\n\np. xii\n\nworks hitherto printed, and in the law-books of Manu, Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya, and\nothers; but nearly all are quoted, exactly in the same order as in this work,\nin the Karaya _n_ iya-ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra, while some of them have\nbeen traced in the Kathaka as well. And what is even more important, the Ka\n_th_ aka G _ri_ hya does not contain those Mantras alone, but nearly all the\nSutras in which they occur; and it may be stated therefore, secondly, that the\nVish _n_ u-sutra has four long sections, viz. Chapter LXXIII, and Chapters\nXXI, LXVII, LXXXVI, excepting the final parts, in common with that work, while\nthe substance of Chapter LXXIV may also be traced in it. The agreement between\nboth works is very close, and where they differ it is generally due to false\nreadings or to enlargements on the part of the Vish _n_ u-sutra. However,\nthere are a few cases, in which the version of the latter work is evidently\nmore genuine than that of the former, and it follows, therefore, that the\nauthor of the Vish _n_ u-sutra cannot have borrowed his rules for the\nperformance of Sraddhas &c. from the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra, but that\nboth must have drawn from a common source, i. e. no doubt from the traditions\ncurrent in the Ka _th_ a school, to which this work is indebted for so many of\nits Mantras as well.\n\n   For these reasons[1] I fully concur in the view advanced by Dr. Buhler,\nthat the bulk of the so-called Vish _n_ u-smriti is really the ancient Dharma-\nsutra of the _K_ araya _n_ iya-ka _th_ aka _S_ akha of the Black Ya _g_ ur-\nveda. It ranks, like other Dharma-sutras, with the G _ri_ hya and _S_ rauta-\nsutras of its school; the latter of which, though apparently lost now, is\ndistinctly referred to in the Grihya-sutra in several places, and must have\nbeen in existence at the time when the Commentaries on Katyayana's _S_ rauta-\nsutras were composed, in which it is frequently quoted by the name\n\n[1. For details I may refer the reader to my German paper, Das Dharmasutra des\nVish _n_ u und das Ka _th_ akag _ri_ hyasutra, in the Transactions of the\nRoyal Bavarian Academy of Science for 1879, where the sections corresponding\nin both works have been printed in parallel columns, the texts from the Ka\n_th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra having been prepared from two of the MSS. of\nDevapala's Commentary discovered by Dr. Buhler (Kasmir Report, Nos. 11, 12),\none in Devanagari, and the other in _S_ arada characters.]\n\np. xiii\n\nof Ka _th_ a-sutra on divers questions concerning _S_ rauta offerings, and at\nthe time, when the Ka _s_ mirian Devapala wrote his Commentary on the Ka _th_\naka Grihya-sutra, which was, according to the Ka _s_ mirian tradition, as\nexplored by Dr. Buhler, before the conquest of Ka _s_ mir by the Mahommedans.\nDevapala, in the Introduction to his work, refers to 'thirty-nine Adhyayas\ntreating of the Vaitanika (= _S_ rauta) ceremonies,' by which the Grihya-sutra\nwas preceded, from which statement it may be inferred that the Ka _th_ aka _S_\nrauta-sutras must have been a very voluminous work indeed, as the G _ri_ hya-\nsutra, which is at least equal if not superior in extent to other works of the\nsame class, forms but one Adhyaya, the fortieth, of the whole Kalpa-sutra,\nwhich, according to Devapala, was composed by one author. It does not seem\nlikely that the Vish _n_ u-sutra was composed by the same man, or that it ever\nformed part of the Ka _th_ aka Kalpa-sutra, as the Dharma-sutras of\nBaudhayana, \xc3\x82pastamba, and Hiranyakesin form part of the Kalpa-sutras of the\nrespective schools to which they belong. If that were the case, it would agree\nwith the G _ri_ hya-sutra on all those points which are treated in both works,\nsuch as e. g. the terms for the performance of the Sa _m_ skaras or\nsacraments, the rules for a student and for a Snataka, the enumeration and\ndefinition of the K _rikkh_ ras or 'hard penances,' the forms of marriage, &c.\nNow though the two works have on those subjects a number of such rules in\ncommon as occur in other works also, they disagree for the most part in the\nchoice of expressions, and on a few points lay down exactly opposite rules,\nsuch as the Vish _n_ u-sutra (XXVIII, 28) giving permission to a student to\nascend his spiritual teacher's carriage after him, whereas the other work\nprescribes, that he shall do so on no account. Moreover, if both works had\nbeen destined from the first to supplement one another, they would, instead of\nhaving several entire sections in common, exhibit such cross-references as are\nfound e. g. between the \xc3\x82pastamba G _ri_ hya and Dharma-sutras[1]; though the\nabsence of such\n\n[1. Buhler, Introduction to \xc3\x82pastamba, Sacred Books, II, pp. xi-xiv.]\n\np. xiv\n\nreferences might be explained, in the case of the Vish _n_ u-sutra, by the\nactivity of those who brought it into its present shape, and who seem to have\ncarefully removed all such references to other works as the original\nDharmasutra may have contained. Whatever the precise nature of the relations\nbetween this work and the other Sutra works of the _K_ arayaniya-ka _th_ aka\nschool may have been, there is no reason for assigning to it a later date than\nto the Ka _th_ aka _S_ rauta and G _ri_ hya-sutras, with the latter of which\nit has so much in common, and it may therefore claim a considerable antiquity,\nespecially if it is assumed, with Dr. Buhler, that the beginning of the Sutra\nperiod differed for each Veda. The Veda of the Ka _th_ as, the Ka _th_ aka, is\nnot separated from the Sutra literature of this school by an intermediate:\nBrahma _n_ a stage; yet its high antiquity is testified by several of the most\neminent grammarians of India from Yaska down to Kaiyata[1]. Thus the Ka _th_\naka is the only existing work of its kind, which is quoted by the former\ngrammarian (Nirukta X, 5; another clear quotation from the Ka _th_ aka, XXVII,\n9, though not by name, may be found, Nirukta III, 4), and the latter places\nthe Ka _th_ as at the head of all Vedic schools, while Patata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali, the\nauthor of the Mahabhashya, assigns to the ancient sage Ka _th_ a, the reputed\nfounder of the Ka _th_ a or Ka _th_ aka school of the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda,\nthe dignified position of an immediate pupil of Vai _s_ ampayana, the\nfountain-head of all schools of the older or Black Ya _g_ ur-veda, and\nmentions, in accordance with a similar statement preserved in the Ramaya _n_ a\n(II, 32, 18, 19 ed. Schlegel), that in his own time the 'Kalapaka and the Ka\n_th_ aka' were 'proclaimed in every village[2].' The priority of the Ka _th_\nas before all other existing schools of the Yagur-veda may be deduced from the\nstatements of the _K_ ara _n_ avyuha[3], which work assigns to them one of the\nfirst places among the divers branches of\n\n[1. See Weber, Indische Studien XIII, p. 437 seq.\n\n2\\. Mahabhashya, Benares edition, IV, fols. 82 b, 75 b.\n\n3\\. See Weber, find. Stud. III, p. 256 seq.; Max Muller, Hist. Anc. Sansk.\nLit., p. 369. I have consulted, besides, two Munich MSS. of the _K_ aranavyuha\n(cod, Haug 45).]\n\np. xv\n\nthe _K_ arakas, whom it places at the head of all schools of the Ya _g_ ur-\nveda. Another argument in favour of the high antiquity of the Ka _th_ as may\nbe derived from their geographical position[1]. Though the statements of the\nMahabhashya and Ramaya _n_ a regarding the wide-spread and influential\nposition of the Ka _th_ as in ancient times are borne out by the fact that the\nKara _n_ avutha mentions three subdivisions of the Ka _th_ as, viz. the Ka\n_th_ as proper, the Pra _k_ ya Ka _th_ as, and the Kapish _th_ ala Ka _th_ as,\nto which the _K_ araya _n_ iyas may be added as a fourth, and by the seeming\nidentity of their name with the name of the __{Greek Ka \xc3\xb0aioi} in the Pa\xc3\xb1 _g_\nab on the one hand, and with the first part of the name of the peninsula of\nKattivar on the other hand, it seems very likely nevertheless that the\noriginal home of the Ka _th_ as was situated in the north-west, i. e. in those\nregions where the earliest parts of the Vedas were composed. Not only the\n__{Greek Ka \xc3\xb0aioi}, but the __{Greek Kamb is\xc3\xb0oloi} as well, who have been\nidentified with the Kapish _th_ ala Ka _th_ as[2], are mentioned by Greek\nwriters as a nation living in the Pa\xc3\xb1 _g_ ab; and while the Pra _k_ ya Ka _th_\nas are shown by their name ('Eastern Ka _th_ as') to have lived to the east of\nthe two other branches of the Ka _th_ as, it is a significant fact that\nadherents of the _K_ araya _n_ iya-ka _th_ aka school survive nowhere but in\nKa _s_ mir, where all Brahma _n_ as perform their domestic rites according to\nthe rules laid down in the G _ri_ hya-sutra of this school[3]. Ka _s_ mir is\nmoreover the country where nearly all the yet existing works of the Ka _th_\naka school have turned up, including the Berlin MS. of the Ka _th_ aka, which\nwas probably written by a Ka _s_ mirian[4]. It is true that some of the\ngeographical and historical data contained in that work, especially the way in\nwhich it mentions the Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ alas, whose ancient name, as shown by the _S_\natapatha Brahma _n_ a (XIII, 5, 4, 7) and\n\n[1. See Weber, \xc3\x9cber das Ramaya _n_ a, p. 9: Ind. Stud. I, p. 189 seq.; III, p.\n469 seq.; XIII, pp. 375, 439; Ind.

This was pointed out to me by Dr. Buhler.]\n\np. xvi\n\nRig-veda (VIII, 20, 24; VIII, 22, 12), was Krivi, take us far off from the\nnorth-west, the earliest seat of Aryan civilization, into the country of the\nKuru-Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ alas in Hindostan proper. But it must be borne in mind that the\nKa _th_ aka, if it may be identified with the ' _K_ araka- _s_ akha,' must\nhave been the Veda of all the _K_ arakas except perhaps the Maitraya _n_ iyas\nand Kapish _th_ alas, and may have been altered and enlarged, after the Kathas\nand Karakas had spread themselves across Hindostan. The Sutras of a _S_ akha\nwhich appears to have sprung up near the primitive home of \xc3\x82ryan civilization\nin India, which was probably the original home of the Ka _th_ as at the same\ntime, may be far older than those of mere Sutra schools of the Black Ya _g_\nur-veda, which have sprung up, like the \xc3\x82pastamba school, in South India, i.\ne. far older than the fourth or fifth century B. C.[1]\n\n   But sufficient space has been assigned to these attempts at fixing the age\nof the Ka _th_ aka-sutras which, besides remaining only too uncertain in\nthemselves, can apply with their full force to those parts of the Vish _n_\nu-sutra only, which have been traced in the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra. It\nwill be seen afterwards that even these sections, however closely connected\nwith the sacred literature of the Ka _th_ as, have been tampered with in\nseveral places, and it might be argued, therefore, that the whole remainder of\nthe Vish _n_ u-sutra, to which the Ka _th_ aka literature offers no parallel,\nmay be a subsequent addition. But the antiquity of the great majority of its\nlaws can be proved by independent arguments, which are furnished by a\ncomparison of the Vish _n_ u-sutra with other works of the same class, whose\nantiquity is not doubted.\n\n   In the foot-notes to my translation I have endeavoured to give as complete\nreferences as possible to the analogous passages in the Smritis of Manu, Ya\n_g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya, \xc3\x82pastamba, and Gautama, and in the four G _ri_ hya-sutras\nhitherto printed. A large number of analogous passages might have been traced\nin the Dharma-sutras of Vasishtha[2]\n\n[1. See Buhler, Introd. to \xc3\x82pastamba, p. xliii.\n\n2\\. See the Benares edition (1878), which is accompanied with a Commentary by\nK _ri_ shnapa _nd_ ita Dharmadhikarin, I should have given references to this\n{footnote p. xvii} work, the first complete and reliable edition of the Vasish\n_th_ a-sm _ri_ ti, in the footnotes to my translation, but for the fact that\nit did not come into my hands till the former had gone to the press. For\nBaudhayana I have consulted a Munich MS. containing the text only of his\nSutras (cod. Haug 163).]\n\np. xvii\n\nand Baudhayana as well, not to mention Hira _n_ yake _s_ in's Dharma-sutra,\nwhich, according to Dr. Buhler, is nearly identical with the Dharma-sutra of\n\xc3\x82pastamba. Two facts may be established at once by glancing at these\nanalogies, viz. the close agreement of this work with the other Sutra works in\npoint of form, and with all the above-mentioned works in point of contents. As\nregards the first point, the Sutras or prose rules of which the bulk of the\nVish _n_ u-sutra is composed, show throughout that characteristic laconism of\nthe Sutra style, which renders it impossible in many cases to make out the\nreal meaning of a Sutra without the help of a Commentary; and in the choice of\nterms they agree as closely as possible with the other ancient law-books, and\nin some cases with the G _ri_ hya-sutras as well. Numerous verses, generally\nin the _S_ loka metre, and occasionally designed as 'Gathas,' are added at the\nend of most chapters, and interspersed between the Sutras in some; but in this\nparticular also the Vish _n_ u-sutra agrees with at least one other Dharma-\nsutra, the Vasish _th_ a-sm _ri_ ti, and it contains in its law part, like the\nlatter work, a number of verses in the ancient Trish _t_ ubh metre[1]. Four of\nthese Trish _t_ ubhs are found in the Vasish _th_ a-smriti, and three in\nYaska's Nirukta as well, and the majority of the _S_ lokas has been traced in\nthe former work and the other above-mentioned law-books, and in other Sm _ri_\ntis. In point of contents the great majority both of the metrical and prose\nrules of the Vish _n_ u-sutra agrees with one, or some, or all of the works\nnamed above. The G _ri_ hya-sutras, excepting the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-\nsutra, naturally offer a far smaller number of analogies with it than the Sm\n_ri_ tis, still they exhibit several rules, in the Snataka-dharmas and\notherwise, that have not been traced in any other Sm _ri_ ti except the work\nhere translated. Among the Sm _ri_ tis again, each single one maybe seen\n\n[1. XIX, 23, 24; XXIII, 61; XXIX, 9, 10; XXX, 47 (see Nirukta 11, 4; Vasish\n_th_ a II, 8-10); LVI, 27 see Vasish _th_ a XXVIII, 15); LIX, 30; LXXII, 7;\nLXXXVI, 16.]\n\np. xviii\n\nfrom the references to contain a number of such rules, as are only met with in\nthis work, which is a very important fact because, if the laws of the Vish _n_\nu-sutra were found either in all other Sm _ri_ tis, or in one of them only,\nits author might be suspected of having borrowed them from one of those works.\nAs it is, meeting with analogous passages now in one work, and then in\nanother, one cannot but suppose that the author of this work has everywhere\ndrawn from the same source as the other Sutrakaras, viz. from ancient\ntraditions that were common to all Vedic schools.\n\n   There are, moreover, a number of cases in which this work, instead of\nhaving borrowed from other works of the same class, can be shown to have been,\ndirectly or indirectly, the source from which they drew, and this fact\nconstitutes a third reason in favour of the high antiquity of its laws. The\nclearest case of this kind is furnished by the Vasish _th_ a-smriti, with\nwhich this work has two entire chapters in common, which are not found\nelsewhere. I subjoin in a note the text of Vasish _th_ a XXVIII, 10-15, with\nan asterisk to those words which contain palpable mistakes (not including\nblunders in point of metre), for comparison with Chapter LVI of this work in\nthe Calcutta edition, which is exceptionally correct in this chapter and in\nChapter LXXXVII, which latter corresponds to Vasish _th_ a XXVIII, 18-22[1].\nIn both\n\n[1. ###\n\n{footnote p. xix}\n\n###\n\nVish _n_ u LVI, 15, 16, the best MSS. read ### but the Calc. ed. and one\nLondon MS. have ### like Vasish _th_ a. Of Vish _n_ u LXXXVII the latter has\nan abridged version, which contains the faulty readings ### ('the skin of a\nblack antelope,' Comm.) and ### (as an epithet of the earth = ### Vish _n_ u\nLXXXVII, 9).]\n\np. xix\n\nchapters Vish _n_ u has mainly prose Sutras and throughout a perfectly correct\ntext, whereas Vasish _th_ a has bad Slokas which, supported as they are by the\nCommentary or by the metre or by both, can only be accounted for by\ncarelessness or clerical mistakes in some cases, and by a clumsy versification\nof the original prose version preserved in this work in others. Another\nchapter of the Vish _n_ u-sutra, the forty-eighth, nowhere meets with a\nparallel except in the third Pra _s_ na of the Dharma-sutra of Baudhayana,\nwhere it recurs almost word for word. An examination of the various readings\nin both works shows that in some of the _S_ lokas Baudhayana has better\nreadings, while in one or two others the readings of Vish _n_ u seem\npreferable, though the unsatisfactory condition of the MS. consulted renders\nit unsafe to pronounce a definitive judgment on the character of Baudhayana's\nreadings. At all events he has a few Vedic Mantras more than Vish _n_ u, which\nhowever seem to be very well-known Mantras and are quoted by their Pratikas\nonly. But he omits the two important Sutras 9 and 10 of Vish _n_ u, the latter\nof which contains a Mantra quoted at full, which, although corrupted (see\nVagas. Sa _m_ h. IV, 12) and hardly intelligible, is truly Vedic in point of\nlanguage; and he adds on his part a clause at the end of the whole chapter[1],\nwhich inculcates the worship of Ga _n_ e _s_ a or _S_ iva or both, and would\nbe quite sufficient in itself to cast a doubt on the genuineness and\noriginality of his version. It is far from improbable that both Vasish _th_ a\nand Baudhayana may have borrowed\n\n[1. ###]\n\np. xx\n\nthe sections referred to directly from an old recension of this work, as\nBaudhayana has borrowed another chapter of his work from Gautama, while Vasish\n_th_ a in his turn has borrowed the same chapter from Baudhayana[1]. It may be\nadded in confirmation of this view, that as far as Vasish _th_ a is concerned,\nhis work is the only Sm _ri_ ti, as far as I know, which contains a quotation\nfrom the 'Ka _th_ aka'(in XXIX, 18). The Dharma-sutras of \xc3\x82pastamba and\nGautama have nowhere a large number of consecutive Sutras in common with the\nVish _n_ u-sutra, but it is curious to note that the rule, which the latter\n(X, 45) quotes as the opinion of 'some' (eke), that a non-Brahmanical finder\nof a treasure, who announces his find to the king, shall obtain one-sixth of\nthe value, is found in no other law-book except in this, which states (III,\n61) that a _S_ udra shall 'divide a treasure-trove into twelve parts, two of\nwhich he may keep for himself. Of the metrical law-books, one, the Ya _g_\n\xc3\xb1avalkya-sm _ri_ ti, has been shown by Professor Max Muller[2] to have\nborrowed the whole anatomical section (III, 84-104 including the simile of the\nsoul which dwells in the heart like a lamp (III, 109, III, 201), from this\nwork (XCVI, 43-96; XCVII, 9); and it has been pointed out by the same scholar,\nthat the verse in which the author of the former work speaks of the \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka and of the Yoga- _s_ astra as of his own works (III, 110) does not occur\nin the Vish _n_ u-sutra, and must have been added by the versificator, who\nbrought the Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya-sm _ri_ ti into its present metrical form. Several\nother _S_ lokas in Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya's description of the human body (111, 99,\n105-108), and nearly the whole section on Yoga (Y. III, 111-203, excepting\nthose Slokas, the substance of which is found in this work and in the code of\nManu, viz. 131-140, 177-182, 190, 198-201) may be traced to the same source,\nas may be also the omission of Vish _n_ u's enumeration of the 'six limbs'\n(XCVI, 90) in the Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya-sm _ri_ ti, and probably all the minor\npoints on which it differs from this work. Generally speaking, those\n\n[1. See Buhler, Introduction to Gautama, pp. l-liv.\n\n2\\. Hist. Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 331.]\n\np. xxi\n\npassages which have been justly noticed as marking the comparatively late\nperiod in which that law-book must have been composed[1]: such as the\nallusions to the astrology and astronomy of the Greeks (Y. I, 80, 295), which\nrender it necessary to refer the metrical redaction of the Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya-sm\n_ri_ ti to a later time than the second century A. D.; the whole passage on\nthe worship of Ga _n_ e _s_ a and of the planets (I, 270-307), in which,\nmoreover, a heterodox sect is mentioned, that has been identified with the\nBuddhists; the philosophical doctrines propounded in I, 349, 350; the\ninjunctions regarding the foundation and endowment of monasteries (II, 185\nseq.)--all these passages have no parallel in this work, while it is not\noverstating the case to say that nearly all the other subjects mentioned in\nthe Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya-sm _ri_ ti are treated in a similar way, and very often in\nthe same terms, in the Vish _n_ u-sutra as well. Some of those rules, in which\nthe posteriority of the Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya-sm _ri_ ti to other law-books exhibits\nitself, do occur in the Vish _n_ u-sutra, but without the same marks of modern\nage. Thus the former has two _S_ lokas concerning the punishment of forgery\n(II, 240, 241), in which coined money is referred to by the term na _n_ aka;\nthe Vish _n_ u-sutra has the identical rule (V, 122, 123; cf. V, 9). but the\nword na _n_ aka does not occur in it. Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya, in speaking of the\nnumber of wives which a member of the three higher castes may marry (I, 57),\nadvocates the Puritan view, that no _S_ udra wife must be among these; this\nwork has analogous rules (XXIV, 1-4), in which, however, such marriages are\nexpressly allowed. The comparative priority of all those Sutras of Vish _n_ u,\nto which similar Slokas of Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya correspond, appears probable on\ngeneral grounds, which are furnished by the course of development in this as\nin other branches of Indian literature; and to this it may be added,\n\n[1. See Stenzler, in the Preface to his edition of Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya; Jacobi, on\nIndian Chronology, in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, XXX, 305\nseq., &c. Vish _n_ u's rules (III, 82) concerning the wording &c. of royal\ngrants, which agree with the rules of Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya and other authors, must\nbe allowed a considerable antiquity, as the very oldest grants found in South\nIndia conform to those rules. See Burnell, South Indian Palaeography, 2nd ed.,\np. 95.]\n\np. xxii\n\nas far as the civil and criminal laws are concerned, that the former\nenumerates them quite promiscuously, just like the other Dharma-sutras, with\nwhich he agrees besides in separating the law of inheritance from the body of\nthe laws, whereas Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya enumerates all the laws in the order of the\neighteen 'titles of law' of Manu and the more recent law-books, though he does\nnot mention the titles of law by name.\n\n   However much the Vish _n_ u-sutra may have in common with the Ya _g_\n\xc3\xb1avalkya-smriti, there is no other law-book with which it agrees so closely as\nwith the code of Manu. This fact may be established by a mere glance at the\nreferences in the foot-notes to this translation, in which Manu makes his\nappearance far more frequently and constantly than any other author, and the\ncase becomes the stronger, the more the nature of these analogies is inquired\ninto. Of Slokas alone Vish _n_ u has upwards of 160 in common with Manu, and\nin a far greater number of cases still his Sutras agree nearly word for word\nwith the corresponding rules of Manu. The latter also, though he concurs in a\nvery great number of points with the other law authors as well, agrees with\nnone of them so thoroughly as with Vish _n_ u. All the Smritis of \xc3\x82pastamba,\nBaudhayana, Vasish _th_ a, Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya, and Narada contain, according to\nan approximate calculation, no more than about 130 Slokas, that are found in\nthe code of Manu as well. The latter author and Vish _n_ u differ of course on\na great many minor points, and an exhaustive discussion of this subject would\nfill a treatise; I must therefore confine myself to notice some of those\ndifferences, which are particularly important for deciding the relative\npriority of the one work before the other. In a number of _S_ lokas Manu's\nreadings are decidedly older and better than Vish _n_ u's. Thus the latter\n(XXX, 7) compares the three 'Atigurus' to the 'three gods,' i.e. to the post-\nVedic Trimurti of 'Brahman, Vish _n_ u, and _S_ iva,' as the commentator\nexpressly states, whereas Manu in an analogous _S_ loka (II, 230) refers to\nthe 'three orders' instead. At the end of the section on inheritance (XVIII,\n44) Vish _n_ u mentions among other\n\np. xxiii\n\nindivisible objects 'a book,' pustakam; Manu (IX, 219) has the same Sloka, but\nfor pustakam he reads pra _k_ akshate. Now pustaka is a modern word[1], and\nVarahamihira, who lived in the sixth century A. D., appears to be the first\nauthor, with a known date, by whom it is used. It occurs again, Vish _n_\nu-sutra XXIII, 56 (proksha _n_ ena ka pustakam), and here also Manu (V, 122)\nhas a different reading (puna _h_ pakena m _ri_ nmayam). The only difference\nbetween Vish _n_ u-sutra XXII, 93 and Manu V, 110 consists in the use of\nsingular forms (te, s _ri_ nu) in the former work, and of plural forms (va _h_\n, s _ri_ nuta) in the latter. Now there are a great many other Sm _ri_ tis\nbesides the Manu-sm _ri_ ti, such as e. g. the Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya and Para _s_\nara Sm _ri_ tis, in which the fiction is kept up, that the laws contained in\nthem are promulgated to an assembly of _Ri_ shis; but there are very few Sm\n_ri_ tis of the least notoriety or importance besides the Vish _n_ u-sutra, in\nwhich they are proclaimed to a single person. Other instances in which Manu's\nreadings appear preferable to Vish _n_ u's may be found, LI, 60 (pretya _k_\neha _k_ a nishk _ri_ tim) = Manu V, 38 (pretya _g_ anmani  _g_ anmani); LI, 64\n(iti katha\xc3\xb1 _k_ ana) = M. V, 41 (ity abravinmanu _h_ ); LI, 76 (tasya) = M.V,\n53 (tayo _h_ ); LIV, 27 (brahma _ny_ at) = M. XI, 193 (brahma _n_ a); LVII, 11\n(purastad anu _k_ oditam) = M. IV, 248; Vasish _th_ a XIV, 16; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 6,\n19, 14 (purastad apra _k_ oditam); LXVII, 45 (sayampratas tvatithaye) = M.\nIII, 99 (sampraptaya tvatithaye), &c. But these instances do not prove much,\nas all the passages in question may have been tampered with by the Vish _n_\nuitic editor, and as in sonic other cases the version of Vish _n_ u seems\npreferable. Thus 'practised by the virtuous' (sadhubhi _sk_ a nishevitam,\nLXXI, 90) is a very common epithet of 'a _k_ ara,' and reads better than\nManu's nibaddha _m_ sveshu karmasu (IV, 155); and kri _kkh_ ratik _rikkh_ ram\n(LIV, 30) seems preferable to Baudhayana's and Manu's k _rikkh_ ratik _rikkh_\nrau (XI, 209). What is more important, the Vish _n_ u-sutra does not only\ncontain a number of verses in the ancient Trishtubh metre, whereas Manu has\nnone, but it shows those identical three Trish _t_ ubhs of Vasish _th_ a and\nYaska, which Dr. Buhler\n\n[1. See Max Muller, Hist. Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 512.]\n\np. xxiv\n\nhas proved to have been converted into Anush _t_ ubh Slokas by Manu (II, 114,\n115, 144)[1]; and Manu seems to have taken the substance of his three _S_\nlokas from this work more immediately, because both he (II, 144) and Vish _n_\nu, (XXX, 47) have the reading av _ri_ noti for at _ri_ natti, which truly\nVedic form is employed both by Vasish _th_ a and Yaska. The relative antiquity\nof Vish _n_ u's prose rules, as compared to the numerous corresponding _S_\nlokas of Manu, may be proved by arguments precisely similar to those which I\nhave adduced above in speaking of the Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya-sm _ri_ ti. As regards\nthose points in the code of Manu, which are usually considered as marks of the\ncomparatively late date of its composition, it will suffice to mention, that\nthe Vish _n_ u-sutra nowhere refers to South Indian nations such as the Dravi\n_d_ as and Andhras, or to the Yavanas; that it shows no distinct traces of an\nacquaintance with the tenets of any other school of philosophy except the Yoga\nand Sa _n_ khya systems; that it does not mention female ascetics\ndisparagingly, and in particular does not contain Manu's rule (VIII, 363)\nregarding the comparatively light punishment to be inflicted for violation of\n(Buddhist and other) female ascetics; and that it does not inveigh (see XV,\n3), like Manu (IX, 64-68), against the custom of Niyoga or appointment of a\nwidow to raise offspring to her deceased husband. It is true, on the other\nhand, that in many cases Vish _n_ u's rules have a less archaic character than\nthe corresponding precepts of Manu, not only in the Slokas, but in the Sutra\npart as well. Thus written documents and ordeals are barely mentioned in the\ncode (if Manu (VIII, 114, 115, 168; IX, 232); Vish _n_ u on the other hand,\nbesides referring in divers places to royal grants and edicts, to written\nreceipts and other private documents, and to books, devotes to writings\n(lekhya) an entire chapter, in which he makes mention of the caste of\nKayasthas, 'scribes,' and he lays down elaborate rules for the performance of\nfive species of ordeals, to which recourse should be had, according to him, in\nall suits of some importance. But in nearly all such cases the antiquity of\nVish _n_ u's\n\n[1. Introduction to Bombay Digest, I, p, xxviii seq.]\n\np. xxv\n\nrules is warranted to a certain extent by corresponding rules occurring in the\nSm _ri_ tis of Yag\xc3\xb1avalkya and Narada; and the evidence for the modifications\nand entire transformations, which the code of Manu must have undergone in a\nnumber of successive periods, is so abundant, that the archaic character of\nmany of its rules cannot be considered to constitute a sufficient proof of the\npriority of the whole code before other codes which contain some rules of a\ncomparatively modern character. To this it must be added that the Narada-\nsmriti, though taken as a whole it is decidedly posterior to the code of\nManu[1], is designated by tradition as an epitome from another and more bulky\nrecension of the code of Manu than the one which we now possess; and if this\nstatement may be credited, which is indeed rather doubtful, the very\nparticular resemblance between both works in the law of evidence and in the\nrules regarding property (see LVIII) can only tend to corroborate the\nassumption that the Vish _n_ u-sutra and the Manu-smriti must have been\nclosely connected from the first.\n\n   This view is capable of further confirmation still by a different set of\narguments. The so-called code of Manu is universally assumed now to be an\nimproved metrical edition of the ancient Dharma-sutra of the (Maitraya _n_\niya-) Manavas, a school studying the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda; and it has been\nshown above that the ancient stock of the Vish _n_ u-sutra, in which all the\nparts hitherto discussed may be included, represents in the main the Dharma-\nsutra, of the Karaya _n_ iya-ka _th_ as, another school studying the Black Ya\n_g_ ur-veda. Now these two schools do not only belong both to that Veda, but\nto the same branch of it, as may be seen from the _K_ ara _n_ avyuha, which\nwork classes both the Ka _th_ as and Karaya _n_ iyas on the one hand, and the\nManavas\n\n[1. See the evidence collected in the Preface to my Institutes of Narada\n(London, 1876), to which the important fact may be added that Narada uses the\nword dinara, the Roman denarius. It occurs in a large fragment discovered by\nDr. Buhler of a more bulky and apparently older recension of that work than\nthe one which I have translated; and I may be allowed to mention,\nincidentally, that this discovery has caused me to abandon my design of\npublishing the Sanskrit text of the shorter recension, as it may be hoped that\nthe whole text of the original work will soon come to light.]\n\np. xxvi\n\ntogether with the six or five other sections of the Maitraya _n_ iyas on the\nother hand, as subdivisions of the _K_ araka _S_ akha of the Black Ya _g_ ur-\nveda. What is more, there exists a thorough-going parallelism between the\nliterature of those two schools, as far as it is known. To begin with their\nrespective Sa _m_ hitas, it has been shown by L. Schroder[1] that the Maitraya\n_n_ i Sa _m_ hita has more in common with the Ka _th_ aka, the Sa _m_ hita of\nthe Ka _th_ as, than with any other Veda. As the Ka _th_ as are constantly\nnamed, in the Mahabhashya and other old works, by the side of the Kalapas,\nwhereas the name of the Maitraya _n_ iyas does not occur in any Sanskrit work\nof uncontested antiquity, it has been suggested by the same scholar that the\nMaitraya _n_ iyas may be the Kalapas of old, and may not have assumed the\nformer name till Buddhism began to prevail in India. However this may be, the\nprincipal Sutra works of both schools stand in a similar relation to one\nanother as their Sa _m_ hitas. Some of those Mantras, which have been stated\nabove to be common to the Vish _n_ u-sutra and Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya only,\nand to occur in no other Vedic work hitherto printed, have been traced in the\nManava _S_ rauta-sutra, in the chapter on Pi _nd_ a-pit _ri_ ya _g_ \xc3\xb1a (I, 2\nof the section on Praksoma)[2], and the conclusion is, that if the _S_ rauta-\nsutra of the Ka _th_ aka school were still in existence, it would be found to\nexhibit a far greater number of analogies with the _S_ rauta-sutra of the\nManavas. The Grihya-sutra of this school[3] agrees with the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_\nhya-sutra even more closely than the latter agrees with the Vish _n_ u-sutra,\nas both works have not only several entire chapters in common (the chapter on\nthe Vai _s_ vadeva sacrifice among others, which is found in the Vish _n_\nu-sutra also), but concur everywhere in the arrangement of the subject-matter\nand in the choice of expressions and Mantras. The Brahma _n_ a stage of Vedic\nliterature is not represented by a separate work in either of the two schools,\nbut a further argument in\n\n[1. On the Maitrayani Sa _m_ hita, journal of the German Oriental Society,\nXXXIII, 177 seq.\n\n2\\. Cod. Haug 53 of the Munich Library.\n\n3\\. Codd. Haug 55 and 56 of the Munich Library. For details, see my German\npaper above referred to.]\n\np. xxvii\n\nfavour of their alleged historical connection may be derived from their\nrespective geographical position. If it has been rightly conjectured above,\nthat the original seats of the Ka _th_ as were in the north-west, whence they\nspread themselves over Hindostan, the Maitraya _n_ iyas, though now surviving\nnowhere except in some villages 'near the Satpu _d_ a mountain, which is\nincluded in the Vindhyas[1].' must have been anciently their neighbours, as\nthe territory occupied by them extended 'from the Mayura mountain into Gu _g_\narat,' and reached 'as far as the north-western country' (vayavyade _s_ a)[2].\nConsidering all this evidence regarding the original connection between the Ka\n_th_ as and Manavas, it may be said without exaggeration, that it would be far\nmore surprising to find no traces of resemblance between their respective\nDharma-sutras, such as we possess them, than to find, as is actually the case,\nthe contrary; and it may be argued, vice versa, that the supposed connection\nof the two works with the Vedic schools of the Ka _th_ as and Manavas[3],\nrespectively, is confirmed by the kinship existing between these two schools.\n\n   In turning now from the ancient parts of the Vish _n_ u-sutra to its more\nrecent ingredients, I may again begin by quoting Professor Max Muller's\nremarks on this work, which contain the statement, that it is 'enlarged by\nmodern additions written in _S_ lokas[4].' After him, Dr. Buhler pointed\nout[5] that the whole work appears to have been recast by an adherent of Vish\n_n_ u, and that the final and introductory chapters in particular are shown by\ntheir very style to have been composed by another author than the body of the\n\n[1. Bhau Daji, journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, X,\n40.\n\n2\\. See a passage from the Mahar _n_ ava, as quoted by Dr. Buhler,\nIntroduction to \xc3\x82pastamba, p. xxx seq. The same readings are found in a Munich\nMS. of the _K_ ara _n_ avyuha-vyakhya (cod. Haug 4.5). With the above somewhat\nunclear statement Manu's definition of the limits of Brahmavarta (II, 17) may\nnot unreasonably be compared.\n\n3\\. The code of Manu has very little in common with the Manava G _ri_ hya-\nsutra, both in the Mantras and otherwise. Both Vish _n_ u and Manu agree with\nthe Ka _th_ aka in the use of the curious term abhinimrukta or abhinirmukta;\nbut the same term is used by \xc3\x82pastamba, Vasish _th_ a, and others.\n\n4 Hist. Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 134.\n\n5\\. Introduction to Bombay Digest. p. xxii.]\n\np. xxviii\n\nwork. If the latter remark were in need of further confirmation, it might be\nurged that the description of Vish _n_ u as 'the boar of the sacrifice' (ya\n_g_ \xc3\xb1avaraha) in the first chapter is bodily taken from the Hariva _m_ sa\n(2226-2237), while most of the epithets given to Vish _n_ u in I, 49-61 and\nXCVIII, 7-100 may be found in another section of the Mahabharata, the so-\ncalled Vish _n_ u-sahasranama. Along with the introductory and final chapters,\nall those passages generally are distinctly traceable to the activity of the\nVish _n_ uitic editor, in which Vish _n_ u (Purusha, Bhagavat, Vasudeva, &c.)\nis mentioned, or his dialogue with the goddess of the earth carried on, viz.\nI; V, 193; XIX, 24; XX, 16-21; XXII, 93; XXIII, 46; XXIV, 35; XLVII, 10; XLIX;\nLXIV, 28, 29; LXV; LXVI; LXVII, 2; XC, 3-5,17-23; XCVI, 97,98; XCVII, 7-21;\nXCVIII-C. The short invocation addressed to Vish _n_ u in LXVII, 12 is proved\nto be ancient by its recurrence in the corresponding chapter of the Ka _th_\naka G _ri_ hya-sutra, and Chapter LXV contains genuine Kathaka Mantras\ntransferred to a Vishnuitic ceremony. Chapter LXVI, on the other hand, though\nit does not refer to Vish _n_ u by name, seems to be connected with the same\nVish _n_ uitic rite, and becomes further suspected by the recurrence of\nseveral of its rules in the genuine Chapter LXXIX. The contents of Chapter\nXCVII, in which it is attempted to reconcile some of the main tenets of the Sa\n_n_ khya system, as propounded in the Sa _n_ khya-karika, Sa _n_ khya-prava\n_k_ anabhashya, and other works, with the Vaishnava creed and with the Yoga;\nthe fact that the two _S_ lokas in XCVI (97, 98) and part of the Slokas in\nXCVII (15-21) have their parallel in similar _S_ lokas of the Bhagavad-gita\nand of the Bhagavata-pura _n_ a; the terms Mahatpati, Kapila, and Sa _n_ khya\n_k_ arya, used as epithets of Vish _n_ u (XCVIII, 26, 85, 86); and some other\npassages in the Vish _n_ uitic chapters seem to favour the supposition that\nthe editor may have been one of those members of the Vish _n_ uitic sect of\nthe Bhagavatas, who were conspicuous for their leaning towards the Sa _n_ khya\nand Yoga systems of philosophy. The arrangement of the Vish _n_ u-sutra in a\nhundred chapters is no doubt due to the same person, as the Commentary points\nout that the number\n\np. xxix\n\nof the epithets given to Vish _n_ u in XCVIII is precisely equal to the number\nof chapters into which the laws promulgated by him are divided (II-XCVII);\nthough the number ninety-six is received only by including the introductory\nand final invocations (XCVIII, 6, 101) among the epithets of Vish _n_ u. It\nseems quite possible, that some chapters were inserted mainly in order to\nbring up the whole figure to the round number of a hundred chapters, and it is\nfor this reason chiefly that the majority of the following additions, which\nshow no Vishnuitic tendencies, may also be attributed to the Vishnuitic\neditor.\n\n   1\\. Most or all of the _S_ lokas added at the end of Chapters XX (22-53)\nand XLIII (32-45) cannot be genuine; the former on account of their great\nextent and partial recurrence in the Bhagavad-gita[1], Mahabharata, and other\nworks of general note, and because they refer to the self-immolation of widows\nand to Kala, whom the commentator is probably right in identifying with Vish\n_n_ u; the latter on account of their rather extravagant character and\ndecidedly Pura _n_ ic style, though the Garu _d_ a-pura _n_ a, in its very\nlong description of the hells, offers no strict parallel to the details given\nhere. The verses in which the Brahma _n_ as and cows are celebrated (XIX, 22,\n23; XXIII, 57-61) are also rather extravagant; however, some of them are Trish\n_t_ ubhs, and the verses in XIX are closely connected with the preceding\nSutras. The two final Slokas in LXXXVI (19, 20) may also be suspected as to\ntheir genuineness, because they are wanting in the corresponding chapter of\nthe Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra; and a number of other verses in divers\nplaces, because they have no parallel in the Smriti literature, or because\nthey have been traced in comparatively modern works, such as the Bhagavad-\ngita, the Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ atantra, &c. 2. The week of the later Romans and Greeks, and\nof modern Europe (LXXVIII, 1-7), the self-immolation of widows (XXV, 14; cf.\nXX, 39), and the Buddhists and Pa _s_ upatas (LXIII, 36) are not mentioned in\nany ancient Sanskrit work. Besides, the passages in question may be easily\nremoved, especially the Sutras referring to the seven days of the week, which\n\n[1. Besides the passages quoted in the notes, 50-53 nearly Bhag.-gita II,\n22-26.]\n\np. xxx\n\nform clearly a subsequent addition to the enumeration of the Nakshatras and\nTithis immediately following (LXXVIII, 8-50), and the rule concerning the\nburning of widows (XXV, 14), which is in direct opposition to the law\nconcerning the widow's right to inherit (XVII, 4) and to other precepts\nregarding widows. That the three terms kashayin, pravra _g_ ita, malina in\nLXIII, 36 refer to members of religious orders seems clear, but it maybe\ndoubted whether malina denotes the Pa _s_ upatas, and even whether kashayin\n(cf. pravra _g_ ita XXXVI, 7) denotes the Buddhists, as dresses dyed with\nKashaya are worn by Brahmanical sects also, and prescribed for students, and\nfor ascetics likewise, by some of the G _ri_ hya- and Dharma-sutras. Still the\nantiquity of the Sutra in question can hardly be defended, because the\nacquaintance of the Vish _n_ uitic editor with the Buddhistic system of faith\nis proved by two other Sutras (XCVIII, 40, 41), and because the whole subject\nof good and evil omens is not treated in any other ancient Smriti. On the\nother hand, such terms as vedaninda and nastikata (XXXVII, 4, 31, &c.) recur\nin most Sm _ri_ tis, and can hardly be referred to the Buddhists in\nparticular. 3. The Tirthas enumerated in LXXXV, some of which are sacred to\nVish _n_ u and _S_ iva, belong to all parts of India, and many of them are\nsituated in the Dekhan, which was certainly not included within the limits of\nthe '\xc3\x82ryavarta' of the ancient Dharma-sutra (LXXXIV, 4). As no other Sm _ri_\nti contains a list of this kind, the whole chapter may be viewed as a later\naddition. 4. The ceremonies described in XC are not mentioned in other\nSmritis, while some of them are decidedly Vish _n_ uitic, or traceable in\nmodern works; and as all the Sutras in XC hang closely together, this entire\nchapter seems also to be spurious. 5. The repetitions in the list of articles\nforbidden to sell (LIV, 18-22); the addition of the two categories of\natipatakani, 'crimes in the highest degree,' and prakir _n_ takam,\n'miscellaneous crimes' (XXXIII, 3,5; XXXIV; XLII), to Manu's list of crimes;\nthe frequent references to the Ganges river; and other such passages, which\nshow a modem character, without being traceable in the Smritis of Ya _g_\n\xc3\xb1avalkya and Narada, may have been added by the Vish _n_ uitic\n\np. xxxi\n\neditor from modern Sm _ri_ tis, either for the sake of completeness, or in\norder to make up the required number of chapters. 6. All the passages hitherto\nmentioned are such as have no parallel in other ancient Sm _ri_ tis. But the\nVish _n_ uitic editor did evidently not confine himself to the introduction of\nnew matter into the ancient Dharma-sutra. That he did not refrain,\noccasionally, from altering the original text, has been conjectured above with\nregard to his readings of some of those Slokas, which are found in the code of\nManu as well; and it can be proved quite clearly by comparing his version of\nthe V _ri_ shotsarga ceremony (LXXXVI) with the analogous chapter of the Ka\n_th_ aka G _ri_ hya-sutra. In one case (LI, 64; cf. XXIII, 50 = M. V, 131) he\nhas replaced the words, which refer the authorship of the Sloka in question to\nManu, by an unmeaning term. The superior antiquity of Manu's reading (V, 41)\nis vouched for by the recurrence of the same passage in the G _ri_ hya-sutra\nof Sa _n_ khayana (II, 16, 1) and in the Vasish _th_ a-sm _ri_ ti (IV, 6), and\nthe reference to Manu has no doubt been removed by the Vish _n_ uitic editor,\nbecause it would have been out of place in a speech of Vish _n_ u. References\nto sayings of Manu and other teachers and direct quotations from Vedic works\nare more or less common in all Dharma-sutras, and their entire absence in this\nwork is apparently due to their systematical removal by the editor. On the\nother hand, the lists of Vedic and other works to be studied or recited may\nhave been enlarged in one or two cases by him or by another interpolator,\nnamely, XXX, 37 (cf. V, 191), where the Atharva-veda is mentioned after the\nother Vedas by the name of '\xc3\x82tharva _n_ a' (not Atharva _n_ girasas, as in the\ncode of Manu and most other ancient works), and LXXXIII, 7, where Vyakara _n_\na, 'Grammar,' i. e. according to the Commentary the grammars of Pa _n_ ini and\nothers, is mentioned as distinct from the Veda _n_ gas. The antiquity of the\nformer passage might indeed be defended by the example of \xc3\x82pastamba, who,\nthough referring like this work to the 'three Vedas' both separately and\ncollectively, mentions in another place the '\xc3\x82tharva _n_ a-veda[1].' Besides\nthe above works,\n\n[1. See Buhler, Introduction to \xc3\x82pastamba, p. xxiv.]\n\np. xxii\n\nand those referred to in LVI, the laws of Vish _n_ u name no other work except\nthe Pura _n_ as, Itihasas, and Dharma _s_ astras. 7. As the Vish _n_ uitic\neditor did not scruple to alter the import of a certain number of passages,\nthe modernisation of the language of the whole work, which was probably as\nrich in archaic forms and curious old terms as the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_ hya-\nsutra and as the Dharma-sutra of \xc3\x82pastamba, may be likewise attributed to him.\nAs it is, the Vish _n_ u-sutra agrees in style and expressions more closely\nwith the Sm _ri_ tis of Manu and Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya than with any other work, and\nit is at least not inferior to the former work in the preservation of archaic\nforms. Thus the code of Manu has seven aorist forms[1], while the Vish _n_\nu-sutra contains six, not including those occurring in Vedic Mantras which are\nquoted by their Pratikas only. Of new words and meanings of words the Vish _n_\nu-sutra contains also a certain number; they have lately been communicated by\nme to Dr. von Bohtlingk for, insertion in his new Dictionary.\n\n   All the points noticed render it necessary to assign a comparatively recent\ndate to the Vish _n_ uitic editor; and if the introduction of the week of the\nGreeks into the ancient Dharma-sutra has been justly attributed to him, he\ncannot be placed earlier than the third or fourth century A. D.[2] The lower\nlimit must be put before the eleventh century, in which the Vish _n_ u-sutra\nis quoted in the Mitakshara of Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ane _s_ vara, From that time downwards\nit is quoted in nearly every law digest, and a particularly large number of\nquotations occurs in Apararka's Commentary, on Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya, which was\ncomposed in the twelfth century[3]. Nearly all those quotations, as far as\nthey have been examined, are actually found in the Vish _n_ u-sutra; but the\nwhole text is vouched for only by Nandapa _nd_ ita's Commentary, called Vai\n_g_ ayanti, which was composed in the\n\n[1. Whitney. Indische Grammatik, \xc2\xa7 826.\n\n2\\. See Jacobi, journal of the German Oriental Society. XXX, 306. The first\nauthor with a known date who shows an acquaintance with the week of the\nGreeks, is Varahamihira (sixth century A, D.)\n\n3\\. See Buhler, Ka _s_ mir Report. p. 52. The MSS. used are from the Dekhan\nCollege, Pu _n_ a.]\n\np. xxiii\n\nfirst quarter of the seventeenth century. The subscriptions in the London MSS.\nof the Vai _g_ ayanti contain the statement, which is borne out by the\nIntroduction, that it was composed by Nandapa _nd_ ita, the son of Ramapa _nd_\nita, Dharmadhikarin, an inhabitant of Benares, at the instigation of the\nMahara _g_ a Ke _s_ avanayaka, also called Tammasanayaka, the son of Ko _d_\napanayaka; and a passage added at the end of the work states, more accurately,\nthat 'Nanda _s_ arman (Nandapa _nd_ ita) wrote it at Ka _s_ i (Benares) in the\nyear 1679 of the era of Vikramabhasvara (= A. D. 1622), by Command of Ke _s_\navanayaka, his own king. These statements regarding the time and place of the\ncomposition of the Vai _g_ ayanti are corroborated by the fact that it refers\nin several cases to the opinions of Haradatta, who appears to have lived in\nthe sixteenth century[1], while Nandapa _nd_ ita is not among the numerous\nauthors quoted in the Viramitrodaya of Mitrami _s_ ra, who lived in the\nbeginning of the seventeenth century[2], and who was consequently a\ncontemporary of Nandapa _nd_ ita, if the above statement is correct; and that\nhe attacks in a number of cases the views of the 'Eastern Commentators' (Pra\n_k_ yas), and quotes a term from the dialect of Madhyade _s_ a.\n\n   The subjoined translation is based upon the text handed down by Nandapa\n_nd_ ita nearly everywhere except in some of the Mantras, which have been\nrendered according to the better readings preserved in the Ka _th_ aka G _ri_\nhya-sutra. The two Calcutta editions of the Vish _n_ u-sutra, the second of\nwhich is a mere reprint of the first, will be found to agree in the main with\nthe text here translated. They are doubtless based upon the Vai _g_ ayanti, as\nthey contain several passages in which portions of Nandapa _nd_ ita's\nCommentary have crept into the text of the Sutras. But the MS. used for the\nfirst Calcutta edition must have been a very faulty one, as both Calcutta\neditions, besides differing from the best MSS. of the Vai _g_ ayanti on a very\ngreat number of minor points, entirely omit the greater part of Chapter LXXXI\n\n[1. Buhler, Introduction to \xc3\x82pastamba, p. xliii.\n\n2\\. Buhler loc. cit.]\n\np. xxxiv\n\n(3-22), the genuineness of which is proved by analogous passages in the other\nSm _ri_ tis[1]. An excellent copy of the Vai _g_ ayanti in possession of Dr.\nBuhler has, together with three London MSS. of that work and one London MS.\ncontaining the text only, enabled me to establish quite positively nearly in\nevery case the readings sanctioned by Nandapa _nd_ ita. I had hoped to publish\na new edition of the text prepared from those MSS., and long ready for the\npress, before publishing my English version. This expectation has not been\nfulfilled, but it is hoped that in the mean time this attempt at a translation\nwill be welcome to the students of Indian antiquity, and will facilitate the\nunderstanding of the text printed in _G_ ivananda Vidyasagara's cheap edition,\nwhich is probably in the hands of most Sanskrit scholars. The precise nature\nof the relation in which the text of my forthcoming edition stands to the\nCalcutta editions may be gathered from the large specimens of the text as\ngiven in the best MSS., that have been edited by Dr. Buhler in the Bombay\nDigest, and by myself in two papers published in the Transactions of the Royal\nBavarian Academy of Science.\n\n   Nandapa _nd_ ita has composed, besides the Vai _g_ ayanti, a treatise on\nthe law of adoption, called Dattaka-mima _m_ sa[2], a commentary on the code\nof Para _s_ ara, a work called Vidvanmanohara-sm _ri_ tisindhu, one called _S_\nraddhakalpa-lata, and commentaries on the Mitakshara and on Aditya _k_ arya's\n\xc3\x82 _s_ au _k_ anir _n_ aya. All these works belong to the province of Hindu\nlaw, and both his fertility as a writer in that branch of Indian science, and\nthe reputation enjoyed by some of his works even nowadays, must raise a strong\npresumption in favour of his knowledge of the subject. The\n\n[1. The first edition of the 'Vaish _n_ ava Dharma _s_ astra' was published in\nBengali type by Bhavani _k_ ara _n_ a; the second, in Devanagari type, is\ncontained in _G_ ivananda Vidyasagara's Dharmashastrasangraha (1816).\n\n2\\. This work has been published repeatedly at Calcutta and Madras, and\ntranslated into English by Sutherland (1821), which translation has been\nreprinted in Stokes' Hindu Law Books. The rest of the above list is made up\nfrom an enumeration of Nandapandita's _T_ ikas at the end of Dr. Buhler's copy\nof the Vai _g_ ayanti, from an occasional remark in the latter work itself\n(XV, 9), and from professor Weber's Catalogue of the Berlin Sanskrit MSS.]\n\np. xxxv\n\ngeneral trustworthiness of his Commentary on the Vish _n_ u-sutra is further\nconfirmed by the frequent references which it contains to the opinions of\nearlier commentators of that work; and the wide extent of his reading, though\nhe often makes an unnecessary display of it, has been eminently serviceable to\nhim in tracing the connection of certain chapters and Mantras with the Ka _th_\naka literature[1]. On the other hand, his very learning, combined with a\nstrict adherence to the well-known theory of Hindu commentators regarding the\nabsolute identity between the teaching of all Sm _ri_ tis, has frequently\nmisled him into a too extensive method of interpretation. Even in commenting\nthe _S_ lokas he assigns in many cases an important hidden meaning to such\nparticles as _k_ a, va, tatha, and others, and to unpretending epithets and\nthe like, which have clearly been added for metrical reasons only[2]. This\npractice, besides being contrary to common sense, is nowhere countenanced by\nthe authority of Kulluka, in his remarks on the numerous identical _S_ lokas\nfound in. the code of Manu. With the Sutras generally speaking the case is\ndifferent: many of them would be nearly or quite unintelligible without the\nexplanatory remarks added, in brackets from Nandapandita's Commentary[3], and\nin a number of those cases even, where his method jars upon a European mind,\nthe clauses supplied by him are probably correct[4]. The same may be said of\nhis interpretations of the epithets of Vish _n_ u, excepting those which are\nbased on utterly fanciful etymologies[5],\n\n[1. See the notes on LXV, 2 seq.; LXXIII, 5-9; LXXXVI, 13. In his Commentary\non LXVII also Nandapandita states expressly that the description of the Vai\n_s_ vadeva is according to the rites of the Ka _th_ a- _s_ akha.\n\n2\\. For instances, see the notes on XX, 45; LXIV, 40.\n\n3\\. See e. g. Chapter V passim.\n\n4\\. Thus nearly all the 'intentionally's' and 'unintentionally's,' &c., as\nsupplied in the section on penances might seem superfluous, or even wrong; but\nas in several places involuntary crimes are expressly distinguished from those\nintentionally committed (see e. g. XXVIII, 48, 51; XXXVIII, 7), and as in\nother cases a clause of this kind must needs be supplied (see XXXIX, 2; LII,\n3; LIII, 5, &c.), Nandapa _nd_ ita is probably right in supplying it from\nother Sm _ri_ tis in most remaining cases as well. This method has\noccasionally carried him too far, when his explanations have not been given in\nthe text.\n\n5\\. See I, 51, 55; XCVIII, 40, 41, 46, &c.]\n\np. xxxvi\n\nas the style of the introductory and final chapters is as artificial, though\nin another way, as the Sutra style. Though, however, in works composed in the\nlatter style, every _k_ a, va, or iti, &c., which is not absolutely required\nby the sense, was probably intended by their authors to convey a special\nmeaning[1], it is a question of evidence in every single case, whether those\nmeanings which Nandapandita assigns to these and other such particles and\nexpletive words are the correct ones. In several cases of this or of a similar\nkind he is palpably wrong[2], and in many others the interpretations proposed\nby him are at least improbable, because the authoritative passages he quotes\nin support of them are taken from modern works, which cannot have been known\nto the author of the Vish _n_ u-sutra. Interpretations of this class have,\ntherefore, been given in the notes only; and they have been omitted altogether\nin a number of cases where they appeared quite frivolous, or became too\nnumerous, or could not be deciphered completely, owing to clerical mistakes in\nthe MSS. But though it is impossible to agree with some of his general\nprinciples of interpretation, or with his application of them, Nandapa _nd_\nita's interpretations of difficult terms and Sutras are invaluable, and I have\nnever deviated from them in my translation without strong reasons to the\ncontrary, which have in most cases been stated in the notes[3]. Besides the\nextracts given in the notes, a few other passages from the Commentary and\nseveral other additions will be given in p. 312; and I must apologize to my\nreaders for having to note along with the Addenda a number of Corrigenda,\nwhich will be found in the same page.
