Vyasa said :-- O King! Mahi _s_ a seeing the Danavas afflicted with\ngrief, quitted his buffalo appearance, assumed a lion form and spreading this\nlong manes began to roar aloud and fell amidst the Deva forces; then the Devas\nwere terrified on seeing his sharp nails. That lion-form Mahi _s_ a first\nattacked so severely the Garu _d_ a with his nails, that his whole body was\nbesmeared with blood; then he attacked Vi _sn_ u's arms with his nails.\n\n\n\n4-11. Seeing the Danava, Vasudeva Hari raised his discus in anger and attacked\nhim with great force to kill him. Just when Hari struck the Danava violently\nwith his Chakra, the powerful Danava quitted immediately his lion-form,\nassumed the buffalo form and struck Hari with his two horns. Vasudeva, thus\npierced in his breast with the horns, became confounded and fled away as best\nas he could till he reached his own abode, Vaikun _t_ ha. Seeing Hari thus\nfleeing away, S'ankara, too, thought him invulnerable and fled to his Kailas'a\nmountain with fear. Brahma, too, fled to his own abode with terror; but the\npowerful Vasava took patience and remained steady in the battle. Varu _n_ a\ntaking his S'akti waited patiently for battle. Yama, too, with his staff\nremained there ready to fight. Kuvera, the Lord of the Yak _s_ as, remained\nvery busy in close fighting with the Danavas; Fire, taking S\xc2\x92akti, also\nwaited. The Sun and Moon, the Lord of the stars, both remained in firm resolve\nto fight with Mahi _s_ a, the lord of the Danavas.\n\n\n\n12-22. O King! In the meanwhile, the Danava forces got angry and attacked them\non all sides, shooting at the enemies a mass of dangerous serpent-like arrows.\nThe Lord of the Danavas, Mahi _s_ a, too, assuming the buffalo appearance,\nreigned supreme in the middle. At this moment fierce sounds of the warriors on\nboth the sides were heard. During the\n\n\n\np. 373\n\n\n\nsharp contest of the Devas and Danavas, the sounds from the bowstrings and the\nclappings of the hands were heard like the roarings of thunder. The powerful\nDanava, then, swelled with pride, began to hurl the mountain tops with his\nhorns, thus killing the Deva forces. Some by hoofs and some by the lashing of\nthe tail, that angry Mahi _s_ a, very wonderful to behold, sent to the region\nof Death. Then the Devas and Gandarbhas became very much frightened; so much\nso, that Indra fled away at once on the sight of Mahi _s_ a. Indra thus\nretreating from the field, Yama, Kuvera, and Varu _n_ a all quitted the\nbattle-ground with fear. Indra fled away quitting his Airavata elephant and\nUchchais'rava horse; so Mahi _s_ a got the possession of the elephant and the\nhorse, as well the heavenly cow of the Sun. So the Danavas considered\nthemselves pre-eminently victorious and returned to their abodes. Next they\nwanted to go, as early as possible, to the Heavens, with all their forces. In\nno time Mahi _s_ a went to the abode of Indra, deserted by all the terror-\nstricken Devas and got the possession thereof. Then taking his seat on the\nbeautiful throne of Indra, he made the other Danavas occupy the several seats\nof the other Devas.\n\n\n\n23-27. Thus fighting full one hundred years, the Danava Mahi _s_ a, puffed up\nwith pride, acquired the seat of Indra, his desired object. He banished the\nDevas from the Heavens; the Devas, thus tormented began to wander in the caves\nof hills and dales for a period of good many years. O King! The Devas, at\nlast, were quite tired and took the four-faced Brahma, the Creator's refuge.\nAt that instant, the Lord of the world, the Rajas incarnate, the Originator of\nthe Vedas, was seated on His lotus seat; surrounding Him were standing his\nmortal sons Marichi, etc., with their passions subdued, mind calm and beyond\nthe sphere of the Vedas and Vedangas; there were there also Siddhas,\nGandarbhas, Kinnaras, Charanas, Uragas, and Pannagas. The terrified Devas then\nbegan to praise and chant hymns to Brahma, the Lord of the world.\n\n\n\n28-33. The Devas said :-- \xc2\x93O Creator! O Lotus-born! O Thou, the Remover of the\npains and afflictions of all this world! How is it that you are not moved with\npity towards the Devas, seeing that we are defeated by the lord of the Danavas\nand have been banished from our abode; what more shall we say, our troubles\nare now indescribable, as we are living in the caves of hills and dales. O\nCreator! A son may be a hundred times guilty of offence; is it, then, that the\nfather, devoid of any feeling of covetousness, deserts his sons and gives them\ntrouble! We are oppressed by the Danavas, we who are wholly devoted to your\nlotus-feet, why are you today showing signs of indifference towards us! That\nwicked Danava is thoroughly enjoying to-day the Heavens of the Devas, is\nforcibly taking their share of the oblations of clarified butter in the Yaj\xc3\xb1as\n(sacrifices)\n\n\n\np. 374\n\n\n\nfrom the Brahma _n_ as; is enjoying the Parijata tree and also the heavenly\nmilching cow, the jewel of the ocean. What more shall we describe to you the\nstrange doings of the Asuras; O Lord of the Devas! You are perfectly aware of\nall that they strive and execute; for, by your knowledge, you know everything\nof this world; therefore, O Lord! We lie prostrate at your feet. That vicious\nDanava, of wicked character and full of mischievous actions, gives us troubles\nin various ways wherever we go; O Lord of the Devas! Thou art our only\nProtector; therefore, O Lord! Do what is good to us. Thou art the Awarder of\nthe desires of the Devas. Thou art the First Creator of the world, and\nPreserver; therefore if Thou dost not do us our good, to whom else shall we\ntake refuge, when we are so severely oppressed as if we are burnt in a forest\nconflagration! Who else is more lustrous, more beneficent and more peace-\ngiving Governor?\n\n\n\n34-35. Vyasa said :-- O king! All the Devas, praising Him thus, bowed down to\nthe Lord of creation with folded hands and saluted him, with their faces very\nheavy, overladen with deep sorrow. The Grand Sire of all the Lokas, seeing the\nplight of the Devas, consoled them with sweet words and made them happy.\n\n\n\n36-43. O Suras! What shall I do? The Danava has become exceedingly haughty on\naccount of his getting boons; he can be killed by females only; He is\ninvulnerable by any male. What remedy is there now? Therefore, O Suras! Let us\nall go to Kailasa, the best of all the mountains; thence we will take\nS'ankara, the expert in doing the works of Gods, and go to Vaikun _t_ ha,\nwhere Vi _sn_ u, the Deva of the Devas resides. There we all will unite and\nhold a counsel and decide what is best to do, to serve the purpose of the\ngods. Thus making out the programme, Brahma riding on his Hamsa went to\nKailasa, accompanied by all the Devas. At the same time S'iva came to know out\nof his introspection about the coming of Brahma and the other Devas and soon\ncame out of his dwelling abode. When they met each other, they saluted each\nother and felt very glad. The Devas then bowed down to them. Seats were given\nto the Devas; and when they sat respectively on their \xc3\x82sanas, the Lord of\nParvati also took his own seat. S'iva asked the welfare of Brahma and the\nDevas and asked the reasons of their coming to Kailasa.\n\n\n\n44\\. O Brahma! What has caused you to come here along with Indra and the other\nDevas? O highly fortunate one! Please mention it.\n\n\n\n45-47. Brahma said :-- O Deva of the Devas! The Danava Mahi _s_ a is\noppressing all the Devas in the Heavens; they therefore terrified are\nwandering hither and thither in the caves and hills with Indra. Mahi _s_ a\n\n\n\np. 375\n\n\n\nand the other Danavas are now accepting their share of Yaj\xc3\xb1as; the Lokopalas,\nbeing oppressed, have come to-day and are now taking shelter of Thee. O\nS'ambhu! Considering the situation serious, I have taken them with me here;\ntherefore, O Deva, do that which is reasonable and by which the purpose of the\nDevas can be carried out. O Bhuta Bhavana! (The creator of the world) The\nwhole charge and responsibility of all the Devas devolves on Thee.\n\n\n\n48\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus, S'ankara smiled a little and spoke\ncharming words to the Lotus-born in the following manner :--\n\n\n\n49-55. O Bibhu! It is You that gave before this boon to Mahi _s_ a; and\ntherefore it is you that have wrought this mischief. The Danava has become so\nstrong a hero that he has caused terror to all the Devas even. Now where can\nwe get such a noble woman who becomes able to kill that Danava, elated with\npride. My wife nor your wife ought to go to battle; even if they, the good\nladies go, how will they be able to fight? The fortunate wife of Indra, too,\nis not expert in the art of warfare; where else there is another lady who can\nkill this demon, blinded with pride. I, therefore, propose this; let us all go\ntoday to Vi _sn_ u and, praising him with hymns, engage him quickly to this\ncause of the gods. Vi _sn_ u is foremost amongst the intelligent; therefore it\nis highly advisable to execute all actions after duly consulting with him. He,\nby dint of his high intelligence, will find out means and effect our purpose.\n\n\n\nVyasa said :-- O King! Brahma and the other Devas heard Rudra and approved\nheartily and saying, \xc2\x93Be it so\xc2\x94 instantly rose up. At the time, seeing all the\nauspicious signs concerning the success of the gods, they all became glad;\nand, riding on their respective vehicles, drove towards the abode of Vi _sn_\nu. Favourable fragrant winds, pleasant to touch, began to blow gently, birds\nbegan to chant hymns of praise and signs of success were seen all along their\nway. The sky was clear and the quarters became free; in short, everything\nshowed favourable all along their way.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventh Chapter on the going of the Devas to Kailasa in the\nFifth Skandha of S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 8](bk05ch08.htm)\n\n"
