Such an act must rest on a sacred authority (agama), and\nserve for man's salvation ( _s_ reyo\xe0\xa4\xbdrtha). The nature of the gift is of less\nimportance. It may be puro _d_ a _s_ a, cake; karu, pulse; sa _m_ nayya, mixed\nmilk; pa _s_ u, an animal; soma, the juice of the Soma-plant, &c.; nay, the\nsmallest offerings of butter, flour, and milk may serve for the purpose of a\nsacrifice.\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, yaga, ya _g_ ana, and ish _t_ i are considered as synonymes.\n\n2\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA II.\n\nThe sacrifice is for the three colours or castes (var _n_ a), for Brahma _n_\nas and Ra _g_ anyas, also for the Vai _s_ ya.\n\n2c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThough the sacrifice is meant for the three castes, here called var _n_ a,\ni.e. colour, the third caste, that of the Vai _s_ ya or citizen, is mentioned\nby itself, while the two castes, the Brahma _n_ as and Ra _g_ anyas (the\nKshatriyas or nobles), are mentioned together. This is done because there are\ncertain sacrifices (bahuya _g_ amana), performed by Brahma _n_ as and Ra _g_\nanyas together, in which Vai _s_ yas take no part. In the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-\nsutras, I, 1, 3, also\n\np. 316\n\nthe Vai _s_ ya is mentioned by himself. In Katyayana's Sutras, however, no\nsuch distinction is made. and we read, I, 6, Brahma _n_ a-ra _g_ anya-vai _s_\nyana _m_ _s_ rute _h_. Women, if properly married, are allowed to participate\nin sacrifices, but no one is allowed to be accompanied by a Sudra woman, even\nthough she be his wife. Properly a Brahma _n_ a should marry a wife of his own\ncaste only. A Kshatriya may marry a woman of his own or of the Brahma _n_ a\ncaste. A Vai _s_ ya's proper wife should be taken from his own caste. See,\nhowever, Manu III, 12 seq.\n\nThe four castes, with the _S_ udra as the fourth, are mentioned once in the\n_Ri_ g-veda, X, yo, 12. The opposition between \xc3\x82ryas and _S_ udras occurs in\nthe Atharva-veda, XIX, 62, &c., and in most of the Brahma _n_ as. In the _S_\natapatha Brahma _n_ a we read of the four castes, Brahma _n_ a, Ra _g_ anya,\nVai _s_ ya, and _S_ udra, and we are told that none of them vomits the Soma.\nKatyayana excludes from the sacrifice the a\xe1\xb9\x85gahina, cripple, sha _n_ _d_ a,\neunuch, and all a _s_ rotriyas, persons ignorant of the Veda, which would bar,\nof course, the whole class of the _S_ udras, but they are also specially\nexcluded. Concessions, however, had to be made at an early time, for instance,\nin the case of the Rathakara, who is admitted to the Agnyadhana, &c. This name\nmeans chariot-maker, but \xc3\x82padeva, in his Mima _m_ sa-nyaya-praka _s_ a,\nremarks that, though rathakara means a chariot-maker etymologically, it should\nbe taken here as the name of a clan, namely that of the Saudhanvanas (MS. Mill\n46, p. 13b). Deva, in his commentary on the Katyayana-sutras, makes the same\nremark. See also Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 12 seq. These Saudhanvanas, often\nidentified with the _Ri_ bhus, are evidently the followers of B _ri_ bu,\nmentioned RV. VI, 45, 31; 33, and wrongly called B _ri_ dhu in Manu X, 107;\nsee M.M., Hist. of A.S.L., p. 494. In the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana- _S_ rauta-sutras,\nXVI, 11, 11 (ed. Hillebrandt), he is rightly called B _ri_ bu. In later times\nRathakara is the name of a caste, and its members are supposed to be the\noffspring of a marriage between a Mahishya and a Kara _n_ i. A Mahishya is the\nson of a Kshatriya and a Vai _s_ ya,\n\np. 317\n\na Kara _n_ i the daughter of a Vai _s_ ya and a _S_ udra. Sudhanvan also is\nused in Manu X, 23, as the name of a caste, namely the offspring of fallen\n(vratya) Vai _s_ yas.\n\nAnother exception is made in favour of a Nishadasthapati, a Nishada chieftain.\nIf it meant a chieftain of Nishadas, it might be meant for a Kshatriya who\nhappens to be a chieftain of Nishadas. Here it is meant for a chieftain who is\nhimself a Nishada, a native settler. He is admitted to the Gavedhuka\nsacrifice.\n\nAgain, although, as a rule, the sacrificer must have finished his study of the\nVeda and be married, a sacrifice is mentioned which a Brahma _k_ arin, a\nstudent, may perform. The case thus provided for is, yo brahma _k_ ari striyam\nupeyat, sa gardabham pa _s_ um alabheta. As these sacrificers are not upanita,\nand therefore without the sacred fires, their sacrifices have to be performed\nwith ordinary fires, and the sacrificial offerings, the puro _d_ a _s_ as, are\nnot cooked in kapalas, jars, but on the earth, while the avadanas (cuttings),\nheart, tongue, &c., are sacrificed in water, and not in fire. The Nishada\nchieftain has to learn the necessary Vedic verses by heart, without having\npassed through a regular course of Vedic study. The same applies to women, who\nhave to recite certain verses during the sacrifice.\n\nThat certain women are admitted to the sacrifice, is distinctly stated by\nKatyayana, I, 1, 7, stri kavi _s_ eshat.\n\n3\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA III.\n\nThe sacrifice is prescribed by the three Vedas.\n\n3c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIn order to know the whole of the sacrifice, one Veda is not sufficient, still\nless one sakha (recension) only. The sacrifice is conceived as a whole, and\nits members (a\xe1\xb9\x85gas) are described in different parts of the three Vedas.\n\n4\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA IV.\n\nBy the _Ri_ g-veda, the Ya _g_ ur-veda, the Sama-veda (is the sacrifice\nprescribed).\n\np. 318\n\n5\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA V.\n\nThe Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasau, the new and full-moon sacrifices, are prescribed\nby the _Ri_ g-veda and the Ya _g_ ur-veda.\n\n6\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA VI.\n\nThe Agnihotra is prescribed by the Ya _g_ ur-veda.\n\n7\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA VII.\n\nThe Agnish _t_ oma is prescribed by all.\n\n7c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nBy saying all, the Atharva-veda is supposed to be included, at least according\nto one commentator.\n\nThe Agnish _t_ oma requires sixteen priests, the Pa _s_ u sacrifices six, the\n_K_ aturmasyas five, the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasas four.\n\n8\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA VIII.\n\nWith the _Ri_ g-veda and Sama-veda the performance takes place with a loud\nvoice (u _k_ _k_ ai _h_ ).\n\n8c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nEven lines of the Ya _g_ ur-veda, if they are contained in the _Ri_ g-veda and\nSama-veda, would have to be pronounced with a loud voice. Certain mantras,\nhowever, are excepted, viz. the _g_ apa, abhimantra _n_ a, and anumantra _n_\na-mantras.\n\n9\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA IX.\n\nWith the Ya _g_ ur-veda the performance takes place by murmuring (upa _m_ _s_\nu).\n\n9c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThis murmuring, upa _m_ _s_ u, is described as a mere opus operatum, the words\nbeing repeated without voice and without thought. One may see the movements of\nthe vocal organs in murmuring, but one should not hear them at a distance. If\nverses from the _Ri_ g-veda or Sama-veda\n\np. 319\n\noccur in the Ya _g_ ur-veda, they also have to be murmured. See Katy. I, 3,\n10.\n\n10\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA X.\n\nWith the exception of addresses, replies, choosing of priests (pravara),\ndialogues, and commands.\n\n10c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nAs all these are meant to be understood by others, they have therefore to be\npronounced in a loud voice. The address (a _s_ ruta) is o _m_ _s_ ravaya; the\nreply (pratya _s_ ruta) is astu _s_ rausha _t_  1; the choosing of priests\n(pravara) is agnir devo hota; a dialogue (sa _m_ vada) is brahman\nprokshishyami, om proksha; a command (sampresha) is proksha _n_ ir asadaya.\n\n11\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XI.\n\nIn the Samidheni hymns the recitation is to be between (the high and the low\ntone).\n\n11c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe Samidhenis are the hymns used for lighting the fire. One commentator\nexplains antara, between, as between high tone (krush _t_ a) and the murmuring\n(upa _m_ _s_ u). Another distinguishes three high tones, the krush _t_ a (also\ncalled tara or krau _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a), the madhyama, and the mandra, and assigns the\nmadhyama to the Samidheni hymns. The mandra notes come from the chest, the\nmadhyama notes from the throat, the uttama notes from the head.\n\n12\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XII.\n\nBefore the \xc3\x82 _g_ yabhagas (such as the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya-portions at the Dar _s_ a-pur\n_n_ amasa), and at the morning Savana (oblation of Soma), the recitation is to\nbe with the soft (mandra) voice.\n\np. 320\n\n12c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe pronunciation is loud, u _k_ _k_ ai _h_ , but soft, mandra. Satyavrata\nrestricts this rule to the passages mentioned in Sutra X. He also treats the\nsecond part of Sutras XII, XIII, and XIV as separate Sutras.\n\n13\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XIII.\n\nBefore the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (at the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa) sacrifice, and\nat the midday Savana, the recitation is to be with the middle voice.\n\n14\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XIV.\n\nIn the remainder and at the third Savana with the sharp (krush _t_ a) voice 1.\n\n14c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe remainder refers to the Dar _s_ a-pur _n_ amasa sacrifice, the three\nSavanas to the Soma sacrifice. Satyavrata takes all these rules as referring\nto the cases mentioned in Sutra X.\n\n15\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XV.\n\nThe movement of the voice is the same.\n\n15c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIn the three cases mentioned before, the voice moves quickly, when the words\nare to be pronounced high; slowly, when low; and measuredly, when neither loud\nnor low.\n\n16\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XVI.\n\nThe Hot _ri_ -priest performs with the _Ri_ g-veda.\n\n17\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XVII.\n\nThe Udgat _ri_ -priest with the Sama-veda.\n\np. 321\n\n18\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XVIII.\n\nThe Adhvaryu-priest with the Ya _g_ ur-veda.\n\n19\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XIX.\n\nThe Brahma-priest with all.\n\n19c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\n'With all' means with the three Vedas, because the Brahma-priest, or\nsuperintendent of the whole sacrifice, must be acquainted with the three\nVedas. Others would include the Atharva-veda.\n\n20\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XX.\n\nWhen it is expressly said, or when it is rendered impossible, another priest\nalso may act.\n\n20c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nVipratishedha is explained by asambhava and a _s_ akti.\n\n21\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXI.\n\nThe priestly office (artvi _g_ ya) belongs to the Brahma _n_ as.\n\n21c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nSacrifices may be performed for Kshatriyas, Vai _s_ yas, and, in certain\ncases, even for others, but never by any but Brahma _n_ as. The reason given\nfor this is curious,\xc2\x97because Brahma _n_ as only are able to eat the remains of\na sacrifice. See _S_ atap. Br. II, 3, 1, 39; Katyayana IV, 14, 11; also I, 2,\n8, cont.\n\n22\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXII.\n\nFor all sacrifices the fires are laid once.\n\n22c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe sacrificial fires have to be arranged for the first time\n\np. 322\n\nby a peculiar ceremony, called the Agnyadhana. They are generally three\n(Treta), the Garhapatya, the father; the Dakshi _n_ a, the son; and the\n\xc3\x82havaniya, the grandson. The first laying of the Garhapatya fire-altar takes\nplace in spring for a Brahma _n_ a, in summer for a Ra _g_ anya, in winter for\na Vai _s_ ya.\n\n23\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXIII.\n\nIf it is said, _g_ uhoti, 'he sacrifices,' it should be known that sarpir a\n_g_ ya, melted butter, is meant.\n\n23c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nSarpis is here taken as an adjective, running; yad asarpat tat sarpir abhavat.\n\xc3\x82 _g_ ya is explained as navanitavikaradravya _g_ atiyava _k_ ana _h_ sabda\n_h_ , i.e. a word signifying any kind of substance made of fresh butter.\n\nIn the Aitareya-Brahma _n_ a I, 3, we read a _g_ ya _m_ vai devana _m_\nsurabhi, gh _ri_ tam manushya _n_ am, ayutam pit _r i_ _n_ am, navanita _m_\ngarbha _n_ am, '\xc3\x82 _g_ ya is sweet or fragrant to the gods, gh _ri_ ta to men,\nayuta to the manes, navanita to children.' Here the commentator explains that\na _g_ ya is butter, when melted (vilina _m_ sarpis), gh _ri_ ta, when\nhardened. Ayuta, sometimes called astu, is butter, when slightly melted,\nnishpakva, when thoroughly melted. According to Katyayana I, 8, 37, a _g_ ya\nis of different kinds. It may be simple gh _ri_ ta, which, as a rule, should\nbe made of the milk of cows. But in the absence of a _g_ ya, the milk of\nbuffaloes (mahisha), or oil (taila), or sesam-oil ( _g_ artila), or linseed\noil (atasisneha), &c., may be taken.\n\n24\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXIV.\n\nIf it is said, _g_ uhoti, it should be known that the Adhvaryu is meant as\nperformer.\n\n24c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThough there is a man who offers the sacrifice, yet the actual homa, the\nthrowing of butter &c. into the fire, has to be performed by the Adhvaryu\npriest.\n\np. 323\n\n25\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XXV.\n\nLikewise, the spoon ( _g_ uhu) as the vessel.\n\n25c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\n_G_ uhu, the spoon, is so called because it is used for pouring out ( _g_\nuhoti, homa).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[319:1](sbe30119.htm#fr_796) See Hillebrandt, Das Altind.
