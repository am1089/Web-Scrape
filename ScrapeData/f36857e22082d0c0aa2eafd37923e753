Metrical criticism.Metre means measure, and\nuniform measure, and hence its importance for critical purposes, as second\nonly to that of grammar. If our knowledge of the metrical system of the Vedic\npoets rests on a sound basis, any deviations from the general rule are rightly\nobjected to; and if by a slight alteration they can be removed, and the metre\nbe restored, we naturally feel inclined to adopt such emendations. Two\nsafeguards, however, are needed in this kind of conjectural criticism. We\nought to be quite certain that the anomaly is impossible, and we ought to be\nable to explain to a certain extent\n\np. lxxviii\n\nhow the deviation from the original correct text could have occurred. As this\nsubject has of late years received considerable attention, and as emendations\nof the Vedic texts, supported by metrical arguments, have been carried on on a\nvery large scale, it becomes absolutely necessary to reexamine the grounds on\nwhich these emendations are supposed to rest. There are, in fact, but few\nhymns in which some verses or some words have not been challenged for metrical\nreasons, and I feel bound, therefore, at the very beginning of my translation\nof the Rig-veda, to express my own opinion on this subject, and to give my\nreasons why in so many cases I allow metrical anomalies to remain which by\nsome of the most learned and ingenious among Vedic scholars would be\npronounced intolerable.\n\nEven if the theory of the ancient metres had not been so carefully worked out\nby the authors of the Prati _s_ akhyas and the Anukrama _n_ is, an independent\nstudy of the Veda would have enabled us to discover the general rules by which\nthe Vedic poets were guided in the composition of their works. Nor would it\nhave been difficult to show how constantly these general principles are\nviolated by the introduction of phonetic changes which in the later Sanskrit\nare called the euphonic changes of Sandhi, and according to which final vowels\nmust be joined with initial vowels, and final consonants adapted to initial\nconsonants, until at last each sentence becomes a continuous chain of closely\nlinked syllables.\n\nIt is far easier, as I remarked before, to discover the original and natural\nrhythm of the Vedic hymns by reading them in the Pada than in the Sa _m_ hita\ntext, and after some practice our ear becomes sufficiently schooled to tell us\nat once how each line ought to be pronounced. We find, on the one hand, that\nthe rules of Sandhi, instead of being generally binding, were treated by the\nVedic poets as poetical licences only; and, on the other, that a greater\nfreedom of pronunciation was allowed even in the body of words than would be\ntolerated in the later Sanskrit. If a syllable was wanted to complete the\nmetre, a semivowel might be pronounced as a vowel, many a long vowel might\n\np. lxxix\n\nbe protracted so as to count for two syllables, and short vowels might be\ninserted between certain consonants, of which no trace exists in the ordinary\nSanskrit. If, on the contrary, there were too many syllables, then the rules\nof Sandhi were observed, or two short syllables contracted by rapid\npronunciation into one; nay, in a few cases, a final m or s, it seems, was\nomitted. It would be a mistake to suppose that the authors of the Prati _s_\nakhyas were not aware of this freedom allowed or required in the pronunciation\nof the Vedic hymns. Though they abstained from introducing into the text\nchanges of pronunciation which even we ourselves would never tolerate, if\ninserted in the texts of Homer and Plautus, in the Pali verses of Buddha, or\neven in modern English poetry, the authors of the Prati _s_ akhya were clearly\naware that in many places one syllable had to be pronounced as two, or two as\none. They were clearly aware that certain vowels, generally considered as\nlong, had to be pronounced as short, and that in order to satisfy the demands\nof the metre, certain changes of pronunciation were indispensable. They knew\nall this, but they did not change the text. And this shows that the text, as\nthey describe it, enjoyed even in their time a high authority, that they did\nnot make it, but that, such as it is, with all its incongruities, it had been\nmade before their time. In many cases, no doubt, certain syllables in the\nhymns of the Veda had been actually lengthened or shortened in the Sa _m_ hita\ntext in accordance with the metre in which they are composed. But this was\ndone by the poets themselves, or, at all events, it was not done by the\nauthors of the Prati _s_ akhya. They simply register such changes, but they do\nnot enjoin them, and in this we, too, should follow their example. It is,\ntherefore, a point of some importance in the critical restoration and proper\npronunciation of Vedic texts, that in the rules which we have to follow in\norder to satisfy the demands of the metre, we should carefully distinguish\nbetween what is sanctioned by ancient authority, and what is the result of our\nown observations. This I shall now proceed to do.\n\nFirst, then, the authors of the Prati _s_ akhya distinctly admit\n\np. lxxx\n\nthat, in order to uphold the rules they have themselves laid down, certain\nsyllables are to be pronounced as two syllables. Vyuha.We read in Sutra 527:\n'In a deficient pada the right number is to be provided for by protraction of\nsemivowels (which were originally vowels), and of contracted vowels (which\nwere originally two independent vowels).' It is only by this process that the\nshort syllable which has been lengthened in the Sa _m_ hita, viz. the sixth,\nor the eighth, or the tenth, can be shown to have occupied and to occupy that\nplace where alone, according to a former rule, a short syllable is liable to\nbe lengthened. Thus we read:\n\nI, 161, 11. u\xcc\x84dva\xcc\x84tsv\xcc\x85\xcc\x86a\xcc\x85\xcc\x84sma\xcc\x84 a\xcc\x86k _ri \xcc\x86_ _n_ o\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84 t _ri \xcc\x86_ _n_ am.\n\nThis would seem to be a verse of eleven syllables, in which the ninth syllable\nna has been lengthened. This, however, is against the system of the Prati _s_\nakhya. But if we protract the semivowel v in udvatsv, and change it back into\nu, which it was originally, then we gain one syllable, the whole verse has\ntwelve syllables, na occupies the tenth place, and it now belongs to that\nclass of cases which is included in a former Sutra, 523.\n\nThe same applies to X, 103, 13, where we read:\n\npr\xcc\x85\xcc\x86e\xcc\x85\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 _g_ a\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 na\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x84 _h_.\n\n[paragraph continues] This is a verse of seven syllables, in which the fifth\nsyllable is lengthened, without any authority. Let us protract preta by\nbringing it back to its original component elements pra ita, and we get a\nverse of eight syllables, the sixth syllable now falls under the general\nobservation, and is lengthened in the Sa _m_ hita accordingly.\n\nThe same rules are repeated in a later portion of the Prati _s_ akhya. Here\nrules had been given as to the number of syllables of which certain metres\nconsist, and it is added (Sutras 972, 973) that where that number is\ndeficient, it should be completed by protracting contracted vowels, and by\nseparating consonantal groups in which semivowels (originally vowels) occur,\nby means of their corresponding vowel.\n\nThe rules in both places are given in almost identically\n\np. lxxxi\n\nthe same words, and the only difference between the two passages is this,\nthat, according to the former, semivowels are simply changed back into their\nvowels, while, according to the latter, the semivowel remains, but is\nseparated from the preceding consonant by its corresponding vowel.\n\nThese rules therefore show clearly that the authors of the Prati _s_ akhya,\nthough they would have shrunk from altering one single letter of the\nauthorised Sa _m_ hita, recognised the fact that where two vowels had been\ncontracted into one, they might yet be pronounced as two; and where a vowel\nbefore another vowel had been changed into a semivowel, it might either be\npronounced as a vowel, or as a semivowel preceded by its corresponding vowel.\nMore than these two modifications, however, the Prati _s_ akhya does not\nallow, or, at least, does not distinctly sanction. The commentator indeed\ntries to show that by the wording of the Sutras in both places, a third\nmodification is sanctioned, viz. the vocalisation, in the body of a word, of\nsemivowels which do not owe their origin to an original vowel. But in both\nplaces this interpretation is purely artificial. Some such rule ought to have\nbeen given, but it was not given by the authors of the Prati _s_ akhya. It\nought to have been given, for it is only by observing such a rule that in I,\n61, 12, go\xcc\x84r na\xcc\x86 pa\xcc\x85\xcc\x86rv\xcc\x86a\xcc\x86\xcc\x86 vi\xcc\x86 ra\xcc\x86da\xcc\x84 ti\xcc\x86ra\xcc\x84 _s_ _k_ a\xcc\x86, we get a verse of\neleven syllables, and thus secure for da in rada the eighth place, where alone\nthe short a could be lengthened. Yet we look in vain for a rule sanctioning\nthe change of semivowels into vowels, except where the semivowels can rightly\nbe called kshaipra-var _n_ a (Sutra 974), i. e. semivowels that were\noriginally vowels. The independent (svabhavika) semivowels, as e. g. the v in\nparva, are not included; and to suppose that in Sutra 527 these semivowels\nwere indicated by var _n_ a is impossible, particularly if we compare the\nsimilar wording of Sutra 974 a.\n\np. lxxxii\n\nWe look in vain, too, in the Prati _s_ akhya for another rule according to\nwhich long vowels, even if they do not owe their origin to the coalescence of\ntwo vowels, are liable to be protracted. However, this rule, too, though never\ndistinctly sanctioned, is observed in the Prati _s_ akhya, for unless its\nauthor observed it, he could not have obtained in the verses quoted by the\nPrati _s_ akhya the number of syllables which he ascribes to them. According\nto Sutra 937, the verse, RV. X, 134, 1, is a Mahapa\xe1\xb9\x85kti, and consists of six\npadas, of eight syllables each. In order to obtain that number, we must read:\n\nsa\xcc\x84mra\xcc\x84 _g_ a\xcc\x84m _k_ a\xcc\x84rsha\xcc\x86 _n_ i\xcc\x84na\xcc\x85\xcc\x86m\xcc\x85\xcc\x84.\n\nWe may therefore say that, without allowing any actual change in the received\ntext of the Sa _m_ hita, the Prati _s_ akhya distinctly allows a lengthened\npronunciation of certain syllables, which in the Pada text form two syllables;\nand we may add that, by implication, it allows the same even in cases where\nthe Pada text also gives but one instead of two syllables. Having this\nauthority in our favour, I do not think that we use too much liberty if we\nextend this modified pronunciation, recognised in so many cases by the ancient\nscholars of India themselves, to other cases where it seems to us required as\nwell, in order to satisfy the metrical rules of the Veda.\n\nSecondly, I believe it can be proved that, if not the authors of the Prati _s_\nakhya, those at least who constituted Shortening of long vowels.the Vedic text\nwhich was current in the ancient schools and which we now have before us, were\nfully aware that certain long vowels and diphthongs could be used as short.\nThe authors of the Prati _s_ akhya remark that certain changes which can take\nplace before a short syllable only, take place likewise before the word no,\nalthough the vowel of this 'no' is by them supposed to be long. After having\nstated in Sutra 523 that the eighth syllable of hendecasyllabics and\ndodecasyllabics, if short, is lengthened, provided a short syllable\n\np. lxxxiii\n\nfollows, they remark that for this purpose na _h_ or no is treated as a short\nsyllable:\n\nX, 59, 4. dyu\xcc\x86-bhi\xcc\x84 _h_ hi\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 _h_ _g_ a\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x86ma\xcc\x84 su\xcc\x86 na\xcc\x86\xcc\x82 _h_ a\xcc\x84stu\xcc\x84, (Sa _m_\nh. su no astu.)\n\nAgain, in stating that the tenth syllable of hendecasyllabics and\ndodecasyllabics, if short, is lengthened, provided a short syllable follows,\nthe same exception is understood to be made in favour of na _h_ or no, as a\nshort syllable:\n\nVII, 48, 4. nu\xcc\x86 de\xcc\x84va\xcc\x84sa\xcc\x84 _h_ va\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x86va\xcc\x84 _h_ ka\xcc\x84rta\xcc\x86na\xcc\x86 na\xcc\x84 _h_ , (Sa _m_ h.\nka\xcc\x84rta\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84 no\xcc\x86, bhuta no, &c.)\n\nWith regard to e being shortened before a short a where, according to rule,\nthe a should be elided, we actually find that the Sa _m_ hita gives a instead\nof e in RV. VIII, 72, 5. veti stotave ambya\xcc\x83m, Sa _m_ h. veti stotava ambya\xcc\x83m.\n(Prati _s_. 177, 5.)\n\nI do not ascribe very much weight to the authority which we may derive from\nthese observations with regard to our own treatment of the diphthongs e and o\nas either long or short in the Veda, yet in answer to those who are\nincredulous as to the fact that the vowels e and o could ever be short in\nSanskrit, an appeal to the authority of those who constituted our text, and in\nconstituting it clearly treated o as a short vowel, may not be without weight.\nWe may also appeal to the fact that in Pali and Prak _ri_ t every final o and\ne can be treated as either long or short a. Starting from this we may\ncertainly extend this observation, as it has been extended by Professor Kuhn,\nbut we must not extend it too far It is quite clear that in the same verse e\nand o can be used both as long and short. I give the Sa _m_ hita text:\n\nI, 84, 17.\n\nka ishate | tu _g_ yate ko\xcc\x84 bi\xcc\x86bha\xcc\x84ya\xcc\x84  \nko ma _m_ sate | santam indra\xcc\x84 _m_ ko\xcc\x86 a\xcc\x84nti\xcc\x84,  \nkas tokaya | ka ibhayo\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x86 ra\xcc\x84ye\xcc\x84  \nadhi bravat | tanve ko\xcc\x84 _g_ a\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84ya\xcc\x84.\n\np. lxxxiv\n\nBut although there can be no doubt that e and o, when final, or at the end of\nthe first member of a compound, may be treated in the Veda as anceps, there is\nno evidence, I believe, to show that the same licence applies to a medial or\ninitial e or o. In IV, 45, 5, we must scan\n\nusra _h_ _g_ arante prati vasto\xcc\x84 _h_ a\xcc\x84 _s_ vi\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84,\n\nending the verse with an epitritus tertius instead of the usual dijambus a.\n\nThirdly, the fact that the initial short a, if following upon a word ending in\no or e, is frequently not to be elided, is clearly recognised by the authors\nof the Prati _s_ akhya (see [p. xlviii](sbe3205.htm#page_xlviii)). Nay, that\nthey wished it to be pronounced even in passages where, in accordance with the\nrequirements of the Prati _s_ akhya, it had to disappear in the Sa _m_ hita\ntext, we may conclude from Sutra 978. It is there stated that no pada should\never begin with a word that has no accent. The exceptions to this rule are\nfew, and they are discussed in Sutras 978-987. But if the initial a were not\npronounced in I, 1, 9, sa _h_ na _h_ pita\xc2\xb4-iva sunave agne su-upayana _h_\nbhava, the second pada would begin with \xe0\xa4\xbdgne, a word which, after the elision\nof the initial a, would be a word without an accent b.\n\nFourthly, the fact that other long vowels, besides e and o, may under certain\ncircumstances be used as short in the Veda, is not merely a modern theory, but\nrests on no less an authority than Pa _n_ ini himself.\n\np. lxxxv\n\nPa _n_ ini says, VI, I, 127, that i, u, _ri_ (see RV. Bh. IV, 1, 12) at the\nend of a pada (but not in a compound a) may remain unchanged, if a different\nvowel follows, and that, if long, they may be shortened. He ascribes this\nrule, or, more correctly, the first portion of it only, to _S_ akalya, Prati\n_s_ akhya 155 seq. b Thus _k_ akri atra may become _k_ akri\xcc\x86 atra or _k_ akry\natra. Madhu atra may become madhu\xcc\x86 atra or madhv atra. In VI, 1, 128, Pa _n_\nini adds that a, i, u, _ri_ may remain unchanged before _ri_ , and, if long,\nmay be shortened, and this again according to the teaching of _S_ akalya, i.\ne. Prati _s_ akhya 136 c. Hence brahma _ri_ shi _h_ becomes brahma\xcc\x86 _ri_ shi\n_h_ or brahmarshi _h_ ; kumari _ri_ _s_ ya _h_ becomes kumari\xcc\x86 _ri_ _s_ ya _h_\nor kumary _ri_ _s_ ya _h_. This rule enables us to explain a number of\npassages in which the Sa _m_ hita text either changes the final long vowel\ninto a semivowel, or leaves it unchanged, when the vowel is a prag _ri_ hya\nvowel. To the first class belong such passages as I, 163, 12; IV, 38, 10, va\n_g_ i\xc2\xb4 arva, Sa _m_ h. va _g_ yarva; VI, 7, 3, va _g_ i\xc2\xb4 agne, Sa _m_ h. va\n_g_ ya\xcc\x83gne; VI, 20, 13, pakthi\xc2\xb4 arkai _h_ , Sa _m_ h. pakthya\xcc\x83rkai _h_ ; IV,\n22, 4, _s_ ushmi\xc2\xb4 a\xc2\xb4 go _h_ , Sa _m_ h. _s_ ushmya\xc2\xb4 go _h_. In these passages\ni is the termination of a nom. masc. of a stem ending in in. Secondly, IV, 24,\n8, patni a _k_ _kh_ a, Sa _m_ h. patnya _k_ _kh_ a; IV, 34, 1, devi\xc2\xb4 ahnam, Sa\n_m_ h. devyahnam; V, 75, 4, va\xc2\xb4 _n_ i _k_ i a\xc2\xb4-hita, Sa _m_ h. va\xc2\xb4 _n_ i _k_\nya\xc2\xb4hita; VI, 61, 4, avitri\xc2\xb4 avatu, Sa _m_ h. avitrya\xcc\x83vatu. In these passages\nthe i is the termination of feminines. In X, 15, 4, uti\xc2\xb4 arva\xc2\xb4k, Sa _m_ h.\nutya\xcc\x83rva\xc2\xb4k, the final i of the instrumental uti ought not to have been changed\ninto a semivowel, for, though not followed by iti, it is to be treated as prag\n_ri_ hya; (Prati _s_. 163, 5.) It is, however,\n\np. lxxxvi\n\nmentioned as an exception in Sutra 174, 9. The same applies to II, 3, 4, vedi\niti asya\xc2\xb4m, Sa _m_ h. vedyasya\xc2\xb4m. The prag _ri_ hya i ought not to have been\nchanged into a semivowel, but the fact that it had been changed irregularly,\nwas again duly registered in Sutra 174, 5. These two prag _ri_ hya i\ntherefore, which have really to be pronounced short, were irregularly changed\nin the Sa _m_ hita into the semivowel; and as this semivowel, like all\nsemivowels, may take vyavaya, the same object was attained as if it had been\nwritten by a short vowel. With regard to prag _ri_ hya u, no such indication\nis given by the Sa _m_ hita text; but in such passages as I, 46, 13, _s_ ambhu\niti _s_ am-bhu a\xc2\xb4 gatam, Sa _m_ h. _s_ ambhu a\xc2\xb4 gatam; V, 43, 4, bahu\xc2\xb4 iti\nadrim, Sa _m_ h. bahu\xc2\xb4 adrim, the prag _ri_ hya u of the dual can be used as\nshort, like the u of madhu atra, given as an example by the commentators of Pa\n_n_ ini.\n\nTo Professor Kuhn, I believe, belongs the merit of having extended this rule\nto final a. That the a of the dual may become short, was mentioned in the\nPrati _s_ akhya, Sutra 309, though in none of the passages there mentioned is\nthere any metrical necessity for this shortening (see [p.\nlii](sbe3205.htm#page_lii)). This being the case, it is impossible to deny\nthat where this a is followed by a vowel, and where Sandhi between the two\nvowels is impossible, the final a may be treated as short. Whether it must be\nso treated, depends on the view which we take of the Vedic metres, and will\nhave to be discussed hereafter.\n\nI agree with Professor Kuhn when he scans:\n\nVI, 63, 1. kv\xcc\x86a\xcc\x86 tya\xcc\x84 va\xcc\x84lgu\xcc\x84 pu\xcc\x86ru\xcc\x86-hu\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x86 a\xcc\x84dya\xcc\x84, (Sa _m_ h. puru-hutadya);\nand not kv\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84 ty\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84 va\xcc\x84lgu\xcc\x84 pu\xcc\x86ru\xcc\x86hu\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x84dya\xcc\x84, although we might quote other\nverses as ending with an epitritus primus.\n\nIV, 3, 13. ma\xcc\x84 ve\xcc\x84 _s_ a\xcc\x84sya\xcc\x86 pra\xcc\x86-mi\xcc\x86na\xcc\x86ta\xcc\x84 _h_ ma\xcc\x86 a\xcc\x84pe\xcc\x84 _h_ , (Sa _m_ h.\nmape _h_ ,) although the dispondeus is possible.\n\nI, 77, 1. ka\xcc\x86tha\xcc\x84 da\xcc\x84 _s_ e\xcc\x84ma\xcc\x86 a\xcc\x84gna\xcc\x86ye\xcc\x84 ka\xcc\x86 a\xcc\x84smai, (Sa _m_ h. kasmai.)\n\nVI, 24, 5. a\xcc\x84rya\xcc\x84 _h_ va\xcc\x86 _s_ a\xcc\x84sya\xcc\x86 pa\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x86-e\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x86 a\xcc\x84sti\xcc\x84.\n\nEven in a compound like tva-uta, I should shorten the first vowel, e. g.\n\nX, 148, 1. tma\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84 ta\xcc\x86na\xcc\x84 sa\xcc\x86nu\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84ma\xcc\x86 tva\xcc\x86-u\xcc\x84ta\xcc\x84 _h_ ,\n\nalthough the passage is not mentioned by the Prati _s_ akhya\n\np. lxxxvii\n\namong those where a short final vowel in the eighth place is not lengthened\nwhen a short syllable follows a.\n\nBut when we come to the second pada of a Gayatri, and find there a long a, and\nthat long a not followed by a vowel, I cannot agree with Professor Kuhn, that\nthe long a, even under such circumstances, ought to be shortened.

Still less can we quote\nnari-bhya _h_ as an instance of a long i being shortened, for nari-bhya _h_ is\nderived from nari _h_ , not from nari, and occurs with a short i even when the\nmetre requires a long syllable; I, 43, 6. n _ri \xcc\x85_-bhya\xcc\x84 _h_ na\xcc\x84ri\xcc\x86\xcc\x84-bhy\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84\n_h_ ga\xcc\x86ve\xcc\x84.

M. Regnier was right, Professor Kuhn (Beitrage, vol. iv, p. 187) was\nwrong. Uva _t_ a, no doubt, wishes to show that original (svabhavika)\nsemivowels are liable to vyuha, or at least p. lxxxii to vyavaya; but though\nthis is true in fact, Uva _t_ a does not succeed in his attempt to prove that\nthe rules of the Prati _s_ akhya sanction it.\n\n[lxxxiii:a](sbe3210.htm#fr_47) See Lassen, Inst.

Reprinted from the American Journal of Philology,\nvol. iii, No. 1.\n\n[lxxxv:a](sbe3210.htm#fr_50) There are certain compounds in which, according\nto Professor Kuhn, two vowels have been contracted into one short vowel. This\nis certainly the opinion of Hindu grammarians, also of the compiler of the\nPada text. But most of them would admit of another explanation. Thus dhanvar\n_n_ asa _h_ , which is divided into dhanva-ar _n_ asa _h_ , may be dhanu-ar\n_n_ asa _h_ (RV. V, 45, 2). Dhanar _k_ am, divided into dhana-ar _k_ am, may\nhave been dhana- _ri_ _k_ am (RV. X, 46, 5). _S_ atar _k_ asam (RV. VII, too,\n3) may be taken as _s_ ata- _ri_ _k_ asam instead of _s_ ata-ar _k_ asam.\n\n[lxxxv:b](sbe3210.htm#fr_51) In the Prati _s_ akhya the rule which allows\nvowel before vowel to remain unchanged, is restricted to special passages, and\nin some of them the two vowels are savar _n_ a; cf. Sutra 163.\n\n[lxxxv:c](sbe3210.htm#fr_52) Cf. Va _g_ asan. Prati _s_ akhya, IV, 48;\nIndische Studien, vol. ix, 309; vol. x, 406.\n\n[lxxxvii:a](sbe3210.htm#fr_53) I see that Professor Kuhn, vol. iv, p. 186, has\nanticipated this observation in esh _t_ au, to be read a\xcc\x86-i\xcc\x84sh _t_ au\xcc\x84.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Part 8](sbe3211.htm)\n\n"
