Thus we three I, Vi _sn_ u, and Mahadeva saw that\nhighly effulgent Goddess: we also saw separately Her attendant goddesses, one\nafter another, that form, as it were, a veil to her? Who were also\npreeminently grand.\n\n\n\n2-3. Vyasa said :-- O king! Narada, the foremost of the Munis, hearing thus\nhis father's words, was exceedingly pleased and asked :-- O Grandsire of all\nthe Lokas! Now describe in detail that ancient and indestructible undecaying,\nunchangeable, eternal Puru _s_ a, that is Nirgu _n_ a (free from Prakritic\nqualities) that you have seen and realised.\n\n\n\n4\\. Father! You have seen the S\xc2\x92akti (the Prime Energy) personified the Sagu\n_n_ a energy, the Supreme Goddess, having hands and feet; but cannot\nunderstand of what kind is that Nirgu _n_ a S\xc2\x92akti which cannot be seen and\nwhich is devoid of all Prakritic qualities.\n\n\n\nO Lotus-born! Be good enough to describe to me the real nature of that\nPrakriti and Puru _s_ a and thus satisfy me.\n\n\n\n5-6. O Lord of Creation! I practised severe austerities in the Svetadvipa\n(white island), so that I might realise and see the Nirgu _n_ a Highest Self\nand the Nirgu _n_ a S\xc2\x92akti, the Supreme Goddess; I saw there many other\nMahatmas (high class spiritual persons) who attained siddhis (supernatural\npowers) practise Tapasya with their passions and anger conquered. But I did\nnot realise nor did I see anything about that Nirgu _n_ a Highest Self.\nFather, I was not despaired; again and again I continued with my ascetic\npractices; but still I failed.\n\n\n\n7\\. Father, you have been so successful as to see that beautiful S\xc2\x92akti with\nqualities; I have heard about Her from you, but how and of what sort, is that\ninvisible attributeless energy as well as that Nirgu _n_ a Purusa. Please\nnarrate and explain all these and satisfy my desires that always reign in my\nbreast.\n\n\n\n8\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus asked by Narada, the Lord of creation, the\ngrandsire of the Lokas, smiled, and began to speak the truth in the following\nwords :--\n\n\n\np. 142\n\n\n\n9\\. O best of Munis! The form of the Nirgu _n_ a Purusa (the Supreme Spirit\nbeyond the Prakritic qualities) cannot exist or be visible; for everything\nthat comes within the range of sight is transitory. How can, then, that\nEternal Spirit have form and how can He become visible!\n\n\n\n10\\. O Narada! The Nirgu _n_ a Energy or Nirgu _n_ a Puru _s_ a comes not\neasily within the range of knowledge; but both of them can be realised by the\nMunis in their meditation in their consciousness.\n\n\n\n11\\. Prakriti and Puru _s_ a have no beginning nor end; they can be realised\nonly through faith; those that have no faith can never realise them.\n\n\n\n12\\. Narada! The universal consciousness, that is felt in all the beings, know\nthat as the Highest Self; the Energy that is universal and is seen always in\nall the beings, know that as the Highest Self.\n\n\n\n13\\. O blessed one! That Puru _s_ a and Prakriti pervade everywhere and exist\nin all the things; in this Universe nothing can exist without the presence of\nboth of them.\n\n\n\n14\\. Both of them are the highest intelligent self, nirgu _n_ a (free from all\nmaterial qualities), without any tinge of impurity, and undecaying. The one\nform that is a combination of these two is always to be meditated in the\nheart.\n\n\n\n15\\. What is S\xc2\x92akti (energy) is the Highest Self; what is the Highest Self is\nthe Highest S\xc2\x92akti. O Narada! Nobody can ascertain the subtle difference\nbetween these two.\n\n\n\n16\\. O Narada! Merely the study of all the S\xc2\x92astras and the Vedas with their\nAmgas without renunciation does not enable one to ascertain the difference\nbetween these two.\n\n\n\n17\\. O Child! This whole universe, moving and non-moving, comes out of\nAhamkara (egoism). How can one ascertain the above difference even if he tries\nfor one hundred kalpas, unless one frees oneself from Ahamkara.\n\n\n\n18\\. The Jivas are Sagu _n_ a (with qualities), how can the Sagu _n_ as see\nthe Nirgu _n_ a One with their physical eyes? Therefore O Intelligent one! try\nto see the Sagu _n_ a (Brahma) only within your heart (until you free yourself\nfrom the material qualities and thus be fit to realise the Nirgu _n_ a\nBrahma).\n\n\n\n19-20. O best of Munis! If the tongue (organ of taste) and eyes (organ of\nsight) be affected with over biliousness, the pungent taste and the yellow\ncolour do not appear what it appeared before; so the hearts of Jivas,\noverpowered with material qualities, are quite unfit for realisation of the\nNirgu _n_ a Brahman. O Narada! That heart again has come\n\n\n\np. 143\n\n\n\nout of Ahamkara; how can then that heart be free from Ahamkara?\n\n\n\n21\\. Until one becomes able to cut asunder all connections with qualities, the\nseeing of that Nirgu _n_ a Brahma is impossible. No sooner one is totally free\nfrom Ahamkara, than the Nirgu _n_ a Brahma is at once seen by him within his\nheart.\n\n\n\n22-24. Narada said :-- O best of the Devas! Ahamkara is three-fold, Satvik,\nRajasik and Tamasik; describe in detail the differences between these three\nsub-divisions as well the real nature of the Gu _n_ as. Also describe to me\nabout that knowledge, knowing which will lead to my salvation. Also describe,\nin detail, the characteristics of the several Gu _n_ as, in due order.\n\n\n\n25-26. Brahma said :-- O Sinless one! The energy of Ahamkara is of three kinds\n:-- Jnana S\xc2\x92akti, Kriya S\xc2\x92akti, and Artha or Dravya S\xc2\x92akti. The power by which\nknowledge is produced or obtained is the Sattvic Ahamkara; the power by which\naction or activity or motion is produced is the Rajasic Ahamkara; and that by\nwhich the material things or objects of have senses are generated is called\nthe Tamasic Ahamkara. O Narada! thus I described to you, in due order, the\nthreefold Ahamkara.\n\n\n\n27-30. Now I describe to you their merits and workings in detail; hear. Out of\nthe Dravya S\xc2\x92akti of the Tamasic Ahamkara come sound, touch, form, taste and\nsmell. From these five qualities, the five Tanmatras or the five subtle-\nelements (primary atoms) are produced.\n\n\n\nSound is the quality of \xc3\x82ka'sa (ether); touch is the quality of Vayu (Air);\nthe form is the quality of Agni (fire); the taste is the quality of Jala\n(water); and the smell is the quality of earth.\n\n\n\nO Narada, these ten gross and subtle materials can, when combined, become\nendowed with power to work out results in the shape of earth, water, fire,\netc., and when the Panchikara _n_ a process is combined, the building of the\nwhole cosmos takes place as a natural consequence of the Tamasa Ahamkara,\nendowed with the energy of generating material substances.\n\n\n\n31-34. Now hear what are produced by the Rajasic energy. The five organs of\nhearing, touch, taste, sight, and smell (ears, skin, tongue, eyes and nose)\ncalled the five J\xc3\xb1anendriyas (organs of senses); mouth, hands, feet, anus and\nthe organs of generation called the five Karmendriyas (organs of action); and\nPrana, Apana, Vyana, Samana, and Udana, the five Vayus. The creation out of\nthese fifteen substances is called the Rajasic energy. Narada! All these\norgans of senses and actions endowed with the Kriya S\xc2\x92akti, called the Kara\n_n_ as and the materials fashioned out of them are called the chidanuvritti or\nMaya.\n\n\n\np. 144\n\n\n\n35-38. O Narada! From the S'attvik Ahamkara are produced the five presiding\nrulers of the five internal organs named Dik (quarters), Vayu, Sun, Varu _n_\na, and the twins Asvini Kumaras and the four presiding rulers of the four fold\ndivisions of Antahkara _n_ a (Buddhis, manas, Ahamkara and chitta) named Moon,\nBrahma, Rudra, and Ksetraj\xc3\xb1a. Thus the above five organs of senses, the five\norgans of action, the five Vayus and mind, these sixteen substances are\nreckoned as the Sattvic creation.\n\n\n\n39-40. O Child! The Highest Self has two forms; one gross and the other\nsubtle. The formless Self; the Consciousness incarnate, as it were, is the\nfirst form. The Seers consider this formless self to be the primary cause (the\nultimatum) of all this phenomenal cosmos. (This is only for the best qualified\nJ\xc3\xb1anis, not for others).\n\n\n\nThe Second Form is the Gross Form for the meditation of the second class\nqualified persons; thus the sages say. This second form of the Supreme Goddess\nis conditioned by inherent Maya (time, space and causation); this is also\ndivided into gross and subtle, according as it is the outer or inner body of\nthe second form (and the form suited for the meditation of the third class and\nthe second class devotees).\n\n\n\n41\\. My body is called Sutratma; I will now tell you the gross body of\nBrahman, the Highest Self.\n\n\n\nO Narada! This my body and soul having the nature of a string or thread is\ncalled Hira _n_ yagarbha; this is also the gross body of the Paramatman;\ntherefore the Paramatman together with the Sutratma, should also be\nworshipped. O Narada! I will now describe to you the outer gross body of\nBrahman, the Highest Self; hear it attentively; if one hears it with faith and\ndevotion, one is sure to get salvation.\n\n\n\n42-43. I have mentioned to you before the five subtle elements, called the\nfive Tanmatras; these, now, when the Panchi Kara _n_ a process is done, are\nconverted into the five gross elements. Now hear what the Panchi Kara _n_ a\nprocess means :--\n\n\n\n44-46. Suppose you are to create the gross element of water. Divide into two\nequal parts the subtle element of water; divide also the other 4 elements into\ntwo equal parts respectively. Now set apart the first half of each of the five\nelements; divide the second half of each of the elements into four equal\nparts. Mix the first half of each of the elements with each of the fourth part\nof the other four elements; and you get one gross element. Similarly you get\nthe other four gross elements. For example :-- You want to get the gross\nelement of water :-- With the half of the subtle\n\n\n\np. 145\n\n\n\nelement (\xc2\xbd) of water mix the fourth part, of the halves of the other elements\nof ether, fire, air and earth; you get the gross element of water and so on.\n\n\n\nThe Panchikara _n_ a process is clearly illustrated in the following table.\n\n\n\nTABLE\n\n\n\n|\n\nEther\n\n|\n\nAir\n\n|\n\nFire\n\n|\n\nWater\n\n|\n\nEarth  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \nEther\n\n|\n\n1/2\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/8  \n  \nAir\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/2\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/8  \n  \nFire\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/2\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/8  \n  \nWater\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/2\n\n|\n\n1/8  \n  \nEarth\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/8\n\n|\n\n1/2  \n  \nGross **** element ****\n\n|\n\n1\n\n|\n\n1\n\n|\n\n1\n\n|\n\n1\n\n|\n\n1  \n  \n\n\n\n\nWhen the five gross elements are thus produced, consciousness then enters into\nthese elements as their presiding deities; next comes the feeling of egoism (I\nness) identifying itself with the body thus created out of the five elements.\n(I am this body and so forth).\n\n\n\n47\\. This great \xc2\x93I\xc2\x94, the great consciousness, creating and considering the\nCosmos as its body is called the Bhagavan, \xc3\x82dideva, Narayana or Vaisvanara.\n\n\n\n48\\. When, by the Panchikara _n_ a process, the five gross elements, earth,\nether, air, etc., are solidified and get their clear definite forms, one, two,\nthree, four, five, qualities are seen to exist in ether, air, fire, water, and\nearth, respectively.\n\n\n\n49-51. Thus ether has one quality only - that is sound: the air has got two\nqualities - sound and touch; the fire possesses three qualities - sound,\ntouch, and form; the water has got four qualities - sound, touch, form and\ntaste; the earth has got five qualities - sound, touch, form, taste and smell,\nand by the various combinations of these five gross elements, is produced this\ngrand Cosmos, the great body of Brahman.\n\n\n\np. 146\n\n\n\n52\\. Similarly the sum-total of Jivas is produced from the several parts of\nthe whole Brahman _d_ a; these Jivas are eighty four lakhs; so the sages say.\n\n\n\nThus ends the Seventh Chapter of the Third Skandha of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000 verses, on the creation and the\nTattvas and their presiding Deities.\n\n\n\nNote :Of these Jivas, those who are the best qualified, the Uttamadhikaris,\nare known as the Brahma _n_ as, Janaghana Turiyas, as denoted by Om Hrim; the\nmiddlings have their gross, subtle and causal bodies and are called as Brahma\nVais'vanara, Sutra, Hira _n_ yagarbhas; and the third class is known as\nVis'va, Taijasa. and Praj\xc3\xb1as and forms the body, as it were, of the Brahman.\nThere are others also, animals, etc., in the lowest class.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 8](bk03ch08.htm)\n\n"
