(The same thing follows) from the express denial of other (existences).\n\nHaving thus refuted the arguments of the purvapakshin, the Sutrakara in\nconclusion strengthens his view by a further reason. A great number of Vedic\npassages--which, considering the context in which they stand, cannot be\nexplained otherwise--distinctly deny that there exists anything apart from\nBrahman; 'He indeed is below; I am below; the Self is below' ( _Kh_. Up. VII,\n25, 1; 2); 'Whosoever looks for anything elsewhere than in the Self was\nabandoned by everything' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 6); 'Brahman\n\np. 180\n\nalone is all this' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); 'The Self is all this' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVII, 25, 2): 'In it there is no diversity' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 19); 'He to\nwhom there is nothing superior, from whom there is nothing different' ( _S_\nvet. Up. III, 9); 'This is the Brahman without cause and without effect,\nwithout anything inside or outside' (B _ri_. Up. II, 5, 19).--And that there\nis no other Self within the highest Self, follows from that scriptural passage\nwhich teaches Brahman to be within everything (B _ri_. Up. II, 5, 19).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 37](sbe38140.htm)\n\n"
