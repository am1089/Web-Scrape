The eater (is the highest Self) since what is movable and what is\nimmovable is mentioned (as his food).\n\nWe read in the Ka _th_ avalli (I, 2, 25), 'Who then knows where He is, He to\nwhom the Brahmans and Kshattriyas are but food, and death itself a condiment?'\nThis passage intimates, by means of the words 'food' and 'condiment,' that\nthere is some eater. A doubt then arises whether the eater be Agni or the\nindividual soul or the highest Self; for no distinguishing characteristic is\nstated, and Agni as well as the individual soul and the highest Self is\nobserved to form, in that [Upanishad](errata.htm#0), the subjects of questions\n2.\n\np. 117\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the eater is Agni, fire being known from\nScripture as well (cp. B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 6) as from ordinary life to be the\neater of food. Or else the individual soul may be the eater, according to the\npassage, 'One of them eats the sweet fruit' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1). On the other\nhand, the eater cannot be Brahman on account of the passage (which forms the\ncontinuation of the one quoted from the Mu. Up.), 'The other looks on without\neating.'\n\nThe eater, we reply, must be the highest Self 'because there is mentioned what\nis movable and what is immovable.' For all things movable and immovable are\nhere to be taken as constituting the food, while death is the condiment. But\nnothing beside the highest Self can be the consumer of all these things in\ntheir totality; the highest Self, however, when reabsorbing the entire\naggregate of effects may be said to eat everything. If it is objected that\nhere no express mention is made of things movable and things immovable, and\nthat hence we have no right to use the (alleged) mention made of them as a\nreason, we reply that this objection is unfounded; firstly, because the\naggregate of all living beings is seen to be meant from the circumstance of\ndeath being the condiment; and, secondly, because the Brahmans and Kshattriyas\nmay here, on account of their pre-eminent position, be viewed as instances\nonly (of all beings). Concerning the objection that the highest Self cannot be\nan eater on account of the passage quoted ('the other looks on without\neating'), we remark that that passage aims at denying the fruition (on the\npart of the highest Self) of the results of works, such fruition being\nmentioned in immediate proximity, but is not meant to negative the\nreabsorption of the world of effects (into Brahman); for it is well\nestablished by all the Vedanta-texts that Brahman is the cause of the\ncreation, subsistence, and reabsorption of the world. Therefore the eater can\nhere be Brahman only.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[116:2](sbe34046.htm#fr_145) Cp. Ka _th_ a Up, I, 1, 13; 20; I, 2, 14.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 10](sbe34047.htm)\n\n"
