If an objection be raised on the ground of (water) not being mentioned in\nthe first fire, we refute it by remarking that just it (viz. water) (is\nmeant), on the ground of fitness.\n\nWell, the purvapakshin resumes, but how can it be ascertained that 'in the\nfifth oblation water is called man,' considering that water is not mentioned\nby scripture with reference to the first fire (altar)? For the text enumerates\nfive fires--the first of which is the heavenly world--as the abodes of the\nfive oblations. With reference to the first of those fires--introduced by the\nwords 'The fire is that world, O Gautama,' it is stated that _s_ raddha\n(faith) is the material constituting the oblation ('on that altar the devas\noffer _s_ raddha'); while nothing is said about water being the offered\nmaterial. If, with reference to the four following fires, viz. Par _g_ anya,\n&c., water is assumed to constitute the offering, we have no objection because\nin the substances stated there as forming the oblations, viz. Soma, and so on,\nwater may preponderate. But to set aside, in the case of\n\np. 107\n\nthe first fire, _s_ raddha (i.e. faith) which is directly mentioned in the\ntext, and to substitute in its place the assumption of water, about which the\ntext says nothing, is an arbitrary proceeding. In reality _s_ raddha be\nexplained, in conformity with its ordinary meaning, as a kind of mental state,\nviz. faith. Hence it is objectionable to maintain that water, in the fifth\noblation, becomes man.\n\nTo this view of the purvapakshin we demur, because, in the case of the first\nfire, the word _s_ raddha is to be taken in the sense of 'water.'--On what\nground?--On the ground of fitness. For on that explanation only beginning,\nmiddle, and end of the passage harmonise so that the syntactical unity of the\nwhole remains undisturbed. On the other explanation (i.e. _s_ raddha being\ntaken in the sense of 'faith'), if the question were asked how water, in the\nfifth oblation, can be called man, and if, in way of reply, the text could\npoint only to faith, i.e. something which is not water, as constituting the\nmaterial of the oblation; then question and answer would not agree, and so the\nunity of the whole passage would be destroyed. The text, moreover, by\nconcluding 'For this reason is water in the fifth oblation called man,'\nindicates the same interpretation 1.--Further, the text points out, as effects\nof _s_ raddha, substances in which water in its gross form preponderates, viz.\nSoma, rain, &c. And this again furnishes a reason for interpreting _s_ raddha\nas water, because the effect generally is cognate in nature to the cause. Nor\nagain can the mental conception called faith be taken out from the mind or\nsoul, whose attribute it is, and be employed as an offering, as the heart can\nbe cut out of the sacrificial animal. For this reason also the word _s_ raddha\nbe taken to mean 'water.' Water can, moreover, be fitly called by that name,\non the ground of Vedic usage, cp. ' _s_ raddha is indeed is water' (Taitt. Sa\n_m_ h. I, 6, 8, 1). Moreover, water when forming the seed of the body enters\ninto the state of thinness, subtilty, and herein again resembles faith, so\nthat its being called _s_ raddha\n\np. 108\n\nis analogous to the case of a man who is as valiant as a lion being himself\ncalled a lion.--Again, the word _s_ raddha may fitly be applied to water,\nbecause water is intimately connected with religious works (sacrifices, &c.)\nwhich depend on faith; just as the word 'platform' is applied to men (standing\non the platform). And finally the waters may fitly be called _s_ raddha, on\naccount of their being the cause of faith, according to the scriptural\npassage, 'Water indeed produces faith in him for holy works 1.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[107:1](sbe38081.htm#fr_72) Upasa _m_ haralo _k_ anayam api _s_ raddha _s_\nabdatvam apam evety aha tv iti. \xc3\x82n.
