XV.\n\nKansa informed by Narada of the existence of Krishn\xcc\x81a and Balarama: he sends\nKe\xc5\x9bin to destroy them, and Akrura to bring them to Mathura.\n\nAFTER these things had come to pass, Arisht\xcc\x81a the bull-demon and Dhenuka and\nPralamba had been slain, Govarddhana had been lifted up, the serpent Kaliya\nhad been subdued, the two trees had been broken, the female fiend Putana had\nbeen killed, and the waggon had been overturned, Narada went to Kansa, and\nrelated to him the whole, beginning with the transference of the child from\nDevaki to Ya\xc5\x9boda, Hearing this from Narada, Kansa was highly incensed with\nVasudeva, and bitterly reproached him, and all the Yadavas, in an assembly of\nthe tribe. Then reflecting what was to be done, he determined to destroy both\nKrishn\xcc\x81a and Rama whilst they were yet young, and before they had attained to\nmanly vigour: for which purpose he resolved to invite them from Vraja, under\npretext of the solemn rite of the lustration of arms, when he would engage\nthem in a trial of strength with his chief boxers, Chan\xcc\x81ura and Musht\xcc\x81ika, by\nwhom they would assuredly be killed. "I will send," he said, "the noble Yadu,\nAkrura the son of Swaphalka, to Gokula, to bring them hither: I will order the\nfierce Ke\xc5\x9bin, who haunts the woods of Vrindavan, to attack them, and he is of\nunequalled might, and will surely kill them; or, if they arrive here, my\nelephant Kuvalayapid\xcc\x81a shall trample to death these two cow-boy sons of\nVasudeva." Having thus laid his plans to destroy Rama and Janarddana, the\nimpious Kansa sent for the heroic Akrura, and said to him, "Lord of liberal\ngifts 1, attend to my words, and, out of friendship for me, perform my orders.\nAscend your chariot, and go hence to the station of the herdsman Nanda. Two\nvile boys, portions of Vishn\xcc\x81u, have been born there, for the express object\nof effecting my destruction. On the fourteenth lunation I have to celebrate\nthe festival of arms 2, and I wish them to be brought here by\n\np. 538\n\nyou, to take part in the games, and that the people may see them engage in a\nboxing match with my two dexterous athletae, Chan\xcc\x81ura and Musht\xcc\x81ika; or haply\nmy elephant Kuvalayapid\xcc\x81a, driven against them by his rider, shall kill these\ntwo iniquitous youngsters, sons of Vasudeva. When they are out of the way, I\nwill put to death Vasudeva himself, the cowherd Nanda, and my foolish father,\nUgrasena, and I will seize upon the herds and flocks, and all the possessions,\nof the rebellious Gopas, who have ever been my foes. Except thou, lord of\nliberality, all the Yadavas are hostile to me; but I will devise schemes for\ntheir extirpation, and I shall then reign over my kingdom, in concert with\nthee, without any annoyance. Through regard for me, therefore, do thou go as I\ndirect thee; and thou shalt command the cowherds to bring in with speed their\nsupplies of milk and butter and curds."\n\nBeing thus instructed, the illustrious Akrura readily undertook to visit\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, and, ascending his stately chariot, he went forth from the city of\nMathura.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[537:1](vp132.htm#fr_1497) Danapati: the epithet refers to Akrura\'s possession\nof the Syamantaka gem (see [p. 433](vp106.htm#page_433)); although, as here\nused by Kansa, it is an anachronism, the gem not becoming his until after\nKrishn\xcc\x81a\'s maturity.\n\n[537:2](vp132.htm#fr_1498) Dhanurmaha: the same phrase p. 538 occurs in the\ndifferent authorities. In its ordinary acceptation it would imply any military\nfestival. There is one of great celebrity, which, in the south of India,\ncloses the Dasahara, or festival of Durga, when military exercises are\nperformed, and a field is ravaged, as typical of the opening of a campaign.\nWorship is paid to military implements. The proper day for this is the Vijaya\nda\xc5\x9bami, or tenth of the light half of \xc3\x81\xc5\x9bwin, falling about the end of\nSeptember or beginning of October. Trans. Bombay Soc. III. 73; also Amara\nKosha, under the word ### (Lohabhisara). Both our text and that of the\nBhagavata, however, intimate the celebration of the feast in question on the\nfourteenth day of the fortnight (in what month is not specified), and an\noccasional \'passage of arms,\' therefore is all that is intended. The\nfourteenth day of the light lunation of any month is commonly held appropriate\nfor a holiday, or religious rite. It will be seen in the sequel, that the\nleading feature of the ceremonial was intended to have been a trial of\narchery, spoiled by Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s breaking the bow that was to have been used on\nthe occasion.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVI](vp133.htm)\n\n'
