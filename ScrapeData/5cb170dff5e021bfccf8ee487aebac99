It is\nthe hope of the Hindus, that he who has so frequently visited the earth to\nrestore order and happiness will come yet again to inaugurate a reign of\nuniversal goodness, peace, and prosperity. When Vishnu in the form of Krishna\nreascended to heaven, the Fourth or K\xc4\x81li Yuga commenced, which, as its name\nimplies, is an age of strife and dissension. In the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" the\ncharacter of this age is vividly described in words that seem prophetic. At\nits termination Vishnu is expected to come again, bearing the name Kalki, to\nput an end to wickedness, and establish a kingdom of righteousness similar to\nthe First or Krit\xc4\x81 Yuga--the age of Truth. These four ages, in the same order\nand with similar characteristics, will again and again be experienced until\nthe final end of all things shall come. The following extract from the "Vishnu\nPur\xc4\x81na" *\n\np. 246\n\nwill give an idea of the evils of the present age, which Kalki is to remove.\n\nIn Magadha a sovereign named Viswasphatika will extirpate the Kshattriya race,\nelevate fishermen, barbarians, Br\xc4\x81hmans, and other castes to power; whilst\nSudras, outcasts and barbarians will be masters of the Indus, Darvika,\nChandrabh\xc4\x81g\xc4\x81, and Kashmir. "The\n\n[![KALIKI.](tn/24600.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/24600.jpg)  \nKALIKI.  \n\nkings will be of churlish spirit, violent temper, and ever addicted to\nfalsehood and wickedness. They will inflict death on women, children, and\ncows; they will seize the property of subjects, be of limited power, and will,\nfor the most part, rapidly rise and fall; their lives will be short, their\ndesires insatiable, and they will display but little piety. The people of\nvarious countries intermingling with them will follow their example; and the\n\np. 247\n\nbarbarians being powerful in the patronage of princes, whilst purer tribes are\nneglected, the people will perish. Wealth and piety will decrease day by day,\nuntil the world shall be wholly depraved. Property alone will confer rank,\nwealth will be the only source of devotion, passion will be the sole bond of\nunion between the sexes, falsehood will be the only means of success in\nlitigation, and women will be the objects merely of sensual gratification.\nEarth will be venerated only for its mineral treasures ( _i.e._ no spot will\nbe peculiarly sacred); the Br\xc4\x81hmanical thread will constitute a Br\xc4\x81hman;\nexternal types will be the only distinctions of the several orders of life,\ndishonesty will be the universal means of subsistence, weakness will be the\ncause of dependence, menace and presumption will be the subterfuge for\nlearning, liberality will be devotion, simple ablution will be purification (\n_i.e._ gifts will be made from the impulse of ordinary feeling, not in\nconnection with religious rites or as an act of devotion, and ablution will be\nperformed for pleasure or comfort, not religiously with prescribed ceremonies\nand prayers). Mutual assent will be marriage, fine clothes will be dignity,\nand water afar off will be esteemed a holy spring. The people, unable to bear\nthe heavy burdens imposed upon them by their avaricious sovereigns, will take\nrefuge among the valleys, and be glad to feed upon wild honey, herbs, roots,\nfruits, flowers, and leaves; their only covering will be the bark of trees,\nand they will be exposed to cold and wind, and sun and rain. No man\'s life\nwill exceed three-and-twenty years. Thus in the K\xc4\x81li Age shall decay flourish,\nuntil the human race approaches annihilation." It is rather strange that the\ncondition of men, in what appeared to the writer of this Pur\xc4\x81na as the most\nmiserable he could imagine, where their dress was bark and their food\n\np. 248\n\nconsisted of roots and fruits, was in the earliest ages regarded as the most\ndesirable. It was thus the old Rishis lived, who are held in the greatest\nesteem.\n\n"When the practices taught by the Vedas and the institutes of law shall nearly\nhave ceased, and the close of the K\xc4\x81li Age shall be nigh, a portion of that\ndivine being who exists of his own spiritual nature in the character of\nBrahm\xc4\x81, and who is the beginning and the end, and who comprehends all things,\nshall descend upon the earth. He will be born in the family of Vishnuyasas, an\neminent Br\xc4\x81hman of Sambhal village, as Kalki, endowed with the eight\nsuperhuman faculties. By his irresistible might he will destroy all the\nMlechchhas (outcasts), thieves, and all whose minds are devoted to iniquity.\nHe will then re-establish righteousness upon earth; and the minds of those who\nlive at the end of the K\xc4\x81li Age shall be awakened and be made pellucid as\ncrystal. The men who are changed in virtue of that particular time shall be as\nthe seeds of human beings, and shall give birth to a race who shall follow the\nlaws of the Krit\xc4\x81 Age, or Age of Purity."\n\nIn the descriptions of Kalki, and in pictures, he is represented as a white\nman riding upon or bowing down before a white horse, and with a sword in his\nhand: he is the purifier of the present degenerate age, and the restorer of\npurity and goodness.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[245:*](hmvp29.htm#fr_226) Page 622.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Jagann\xc4\x81th](hmvp30.htm)\n\n'
