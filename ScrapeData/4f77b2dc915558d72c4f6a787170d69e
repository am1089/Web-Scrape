Peace!! Peace!!! Amen!\n\nOm! In the Brahmavarta, at the foot of a mighty _bh andira_ fig tree, there\nassembled Sanaka and\n\np. 212\n\nother mighty sages for a great sacrifice. Then, desirous to know of Truth,\nthey approached the long-lived Markandeya with sacrificial fuel * in hand, and\nasked: Whereby dost thou live so long? and whereby dost thou enjoy such bliss?\n\nHe said: It is by knowledge of the highest secret, of S\'iva, the Reality.\n\nWhat is it which constitutes knowledge of the highest secret,--of Siva, the\nReality? Who is the Deity there? What the mantras? What the devotion? What the\nmeans to that knowledge? What the necessary aids? What the offering? What the\ntime? What the seat thereof?\n\np. 213\n\nHe said: That constitutes knowledge of the Highest Secret,--of S\'iva, the\nReality--by which Siva, the Dakshinamukha, * becomes intuited. He is the Deity\nwho, at the time of universal dissolution, absorbs all into Himself, and who\nshines and delights in the happiness of His own inherent bliss.\n\np. 214 p. 215\n\np. 216\n\np. 217\n\n[Here the Upanishad mentions five mantras, \xe2\x80\xa0 containing respectively 24, 9,\n18, 12, and 32 syllables, and recommends a contemplation of the Deity in one\nor another of His forms \xe2\x80\xa1 described as follows:]\n\n1\\. I adore the three-eyed, moon-crested Dakshinamurti who is of pebble and\nsilver colour, holding in the hands a rosary of pearls, a vessel of nectar, a\nbook and the symbol of wisdom; having a serpent for his girdle, and putting on\nvarious ornaments.\n\n2\\. May the milk-white three-eyed Primal Being (Bhava) grant us purity of\nthought, He who, seated at the foot of a fig tree, surrounded by S\'uka and\nother sages, holding in the hands the symbol of the blessed wisdom, with axe\nand deer,--one of the hands resting on the knees, the\n\np. 218\n\nloins girdled round by a mighty serpent, a digit of the moon enclosed in His\nclotted hair!\n\n3\\. May Dakshinamurti, the Gracious Lord, ever protect us, His body white with\nashes, wearing a digit of the moon, with the lotus-like hands shining with the\nsymbol of wisdom, a rosary, a lute, and a book; handsome with the yogic bell,\nseated in the posture of an expositor, surrounded by hosts of mighty sages,\nwith serpents on, and clad in hide!\n\n4\\. I adore Him who in His hands holds a via, a book and a rosary, with a\ncloudlike throat, who is rich in gifts, girdled by a mighty serpent, resorted\nto by S\'uka and other sages; who has made the foot of a fig tree His abode.\n\n5\\. I contemplate, for the attainment of the highest end, the Supreme Guru,\nthe spouse of Bhavani, the serene-faced Primal Being, He who is spoken of in\nall the Vedas (the first utterances), whose\n\np. 219\n\nhands shine with the symbol (of wisdom), with a book and fire and a serpent,\nwho, bedecked with garlands of pearls and a crown blazing forth brilliant with\nthe digit of the moon, resides at the foot of a fig tree and removes the\nignorance of all.\n\n_Devotion_  * consists in firmly dwelling in the constant thought that "I am\nHe \xe2\x80\xa0." Repetition of the mantra as inseparate from Him constitutes the means\nto that knowledge. To he concentrated in thought upon Him exclusively proves\nan effective aid to it. The dedicating of all bodily activity (to Him) forms\nthe _offering_. The three states of consciousness ( _dh amans_ or _avasthas_ ,\nsuch as jagrat, svapna, and sushupti) are the proper time for it. The proper\n_place_ is the twelve-pointed seat ( _i.e._ , the. sahasrara or thousand-\nspoked wheel in the cavity of the head).\n\np. 220\n\nThen again they asked Him as follows, full of faith: How comes His\nmanifestation? What is His form? And who is His worshipper?\n\np. 221\n\nHe said: In the mighty lamp of _wisdom_ , overflowing with the oil of\n_vairagya_ (indifference to worldly objects) and furnished with the wick of\n_Bhakti_ (Faith) one should kindle the light of knowledge and see. Then the\ndarkness of delusion being dispelled, (S\'iva) Himself becomes manifested. With\na view to dispel the utter darkness, the devotee should produce fire, making\n_vairagya_ the lower _arani_ (stick) and knowledge the upper one *; and then\nS\'iva will exhibit to his view the hidden Reality. Dwelling in the devotee as\nhis own very Self with His inherent bliss, He revives _viveka_ or\ndiscriminative wisdom hitherto overpowered with delusion and oppressed by\nduality for want of proper enquiry into truth. Thus (in the language of the\nPurina) S\'iva, showing Himself in all His bliss, restores to life the son of\nMrikandu, hitherto\n\np. 222\n\noppressed with the fear of Yama, the latter dragging him with the bands of\nrope tied around his body. \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nThe word \'Dakshina\' means Buddhi. Because Buddhi is the eye by which S\'iva can\nbe _directly_ seen, He is called _Dakshinabhimtikha_ by the Brahma-vadins.\n\nAt the beginning of creation, Brahma the Lord, having worshipped S\'iva,\nattained power to create and was delighted at heart. The devotee in this path,\nsteady in his effort; attains all objects of desire and becomes quite happy.\n\nWhoever studies this highly Secret Doctrine of Siva, the Reality, He is\ndelivered from all sins. He who knows thus attains liberation.\n\nSUCH IS THE UPANISHAD.\n\np. 223\n\nMay (Brahman) protect us both!  \nMay He give us both to enjoy!  \nEfficiency may we both attain!  \nEffective may our study prove!  \nHate may we not (each other) at all!  \nPeace! Peace!! Peace!!! Amen!\n\n\n\n\n\nOM TAT SAT.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[211:*](dast16.htm#fr_4) This Upanishad is said to belong to the Black Yajur-\nVeda.\n\n[211:\xe2\x80\xa0](dast16.htm#fr_5) _i.e._ , master and pupil.\n\n[212:*](dast16.htm#fr_6) An offering with which a disciple approaches a\nteacher of spiritual wisdom.\n\n[213:*](dast16.htm#fr_7) The word \'Dakshinamukha\' is interpreted in two ways:\n_first_ as referring to that Incarnation of Siva in which He is represented as\na Guru teaching spiritual wisdom at the foot of a fig tree with His face\nturned to the South; _secondly_ as referring to the Unconditioned Formless\nDivine Being who can be intuited only by the _dakshina_ or buddhi becoming\nperfectly pure and serene. Those who are not equal to the contemplation of the\nDivine Being in the latter aspect are recommended to contemplate Him in the\nformer.\n\n[217:\xe2\x80\xa0](dast16.htm#fr_8) These mantras are not given in the translation,\nbecause, to be effective at all, they should be learned from a duly initiated\nGuru. In the longer mantras, the Deity is invoked to grant spiritual wisdom to\nthe devotee.\n\n[217:\xe2\x80\xa1](dast16.htm#fr_9) For the contemplation to prove effective, the devotee\nshould contemplate the Deity in the form described in the scriptures.\n\n[219:*](dast16.htm#fr_10) This and what follows form answers to so me of the\nquestions put by the sages to the Teacher.\n\n[219:\xe2\x80\xa0](dast16.htm#fr_11) _i.e._. "I am identical with S\'iva."\n\n[221:*](dast16.htm#fr_12) The figure refers to the process of producing fire\nby attrition for sacrificial purposes.\n\n[222:\xe2\x80\xa0](dast16.htm#fr_13) This is one of the many instances where a minor\nUpanishad affords an esoteric interpretation of a Puranic allegory, The Purana\nsays that the sage Markandeya was first destined to live a very short life;\nbut that, by devotion to God--to Siva according to some puranas, to _Vishnu_\naccording to others--he overcame Yama, god of death, who came on the appointed\nday to take away his life and began to drag him by means of his bands of rope.\nHere, according to the Upanishad, Markandeya takes the place of _Viveka_ or\nwisdom; Yama, of _moha_ or delusion; ropes, of the absence of enquiry; and\nfear, of the duality.\n\n\n\n'
