In obtaining another of that, it goes enveloped, (as appears) from\nquestion and explanation.\n\nThat the Vedanta-texts establish as the proper object of meditation, on the\npart of all men desirous of Release, the highest Brahman, which is the only\ncause of the entire world, which is not touched by even a shadow of\nimperfection, which is an ocean, as it were, of supremely exalted qualities,\nand which totally differs in nature from all other beings--this is the point\nproved in the two previous adhyayas; there being given at the same time\narguments to disprove the objections raised against the Vedanta doctrine on\nthe basis of Sm _ri_ ti and reasoning, to refute the views held by other\nschools, to show that the different Vedanta-texts do not contradict each\nother, and to prove that the Self is the object of activities (enjoined in\ninjunctions of meditation, and so on). In short, those two adhyayas have set\nforth the essential nature of Brahman. The subsequent part of the work now\nmakes it its task to enquire into the mode of attaining to Brahman, together\nwith the means of attainment. The third adhyaya is concerned with an enquiry\ninto meditation--which is the means of attaining to Brahman; and as the motive\nfor entering on such meditation is supplied by the absence of all desire for\nwhat is other than the thing to be obtained, and by the desire for that thing,\nthe points first to be enquired into are the imperfections of the individual\nsoul--moving about in the different worlds, whether waking or dreaming or\nmerged in dreamless sleep, or in the state of swoon; and those blessed\ncharacteristics by which Brahman is raised above all these imperfections.\nThese are the topics of the first and second padas of the adhyaya.\n\nThe first question to be considered is whether the soul,\n\np. 585\n\nwhen moving from one body into another, is enveloped by those subtle rudiments\nof the elements from which the new body is produced, or not. The Purvapakshin\nmaintains the latter alternative; for, he says, wherever the soul goes it can\neasily provide itself there with those rudiments. Other reasons supporting\nthis prima facie view will be mentioned and refuted further on.--The Sutra\nstates the view finally accepted, \'In obtaining another "of that" it goes\nenveloped.\' The \'of that\' refers back to the form, i.e. body, mentioned in II,\n4, 17. The soul when moving towards another embodiment goes enveloped by the\nrudiments of the elements. This is known \'from question and explanation,\' i.e.\nanswer. Question and answer are recorded in the \'Knowledge of the five fires\'\n( _Kh_. Up. V, 3-10), where Pravaha _n_ a, after having addressed to _S_\nvetaketu several other questions, finally asks \'Do you know why in the fifth\nlibation water is called man?\' In answer to this last question the text then\nexplains how the Devas, i.e. the pra _n_ as attached to the soul, offer into\nthe heavenly world, imagined as a sacrificial fire, the oblation called _s_\nraddha; how this _s_ raddha changes itself into a body con sisting of am _ri_\nta, which body is called moon; how the same pra _n_ as offer this body of am\n_ri_ ta in Par _g_ anya, imagined as a fire, whereupon the body so offered\nbecomes rain; how the same pra _n_ as throw that rain on to the earth, also\nimagined as a sacrificial fire, whereupon it becomes food; how this food is\nthen offered into man, also compared to fire, where it becomes seed; and how,\nfinally, this seed is offered into woman, also compared to a fire, and there\nbecomes an embryo. The text then goes on, \'Thus in the fifth oblation water\nbecomes purushava _k_ as,\' i.e. to be designated by the term _man_. And this\nmeans that the water which, in a subtle form, was throughout present in the\nprevious oblations also, now, in that fifth oblation, assumes the form of a\nman.--From this question and answer it thus appears that the soul moves\ntowards a new embodiment, together with the subtle rudiments from which the\nnew body springs.--But the words, \'water becomes purushava _k_ as,\' only\nintimate that water assumes\n\np. 586\n\nthe form of a man, whence we conclude that water only invests the soul during\nits wanderings; how then can it be held that the soul moves invested by the\nrudiments of all elements?--To this question the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
