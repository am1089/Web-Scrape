They attached themselves to\nSandip\'s leadership with enthusiasm, and some, in their excess of zeal, gave\nup their studies altogether. Many of the boys had been free pupils of my\nschool here, and some held college scholarships from me in Calcutta. They came\nup in a body, and demanded that I should banish foreign goods from my Suksar\nmarket.\n\nI told them I could not do it.\n\nThey were sarcastic: "Why, Maharaja, will the loss be too much for you?"\n\nI took no notice of the insult in their tone, and was about to reply that the\nloss would fall on the poor traders and their customers, not on me, when my\nmaster, who was present, interposed.\n\n"Yes, the loss will be his--not yours, that is clear enough," he said.\n\n"But for one\'s country .."\n\n"The country does not mean the soil, but the men on it," interrupted my master\nagain. "Have you yet wasted so much as a glance on what was happening to them?\nBut now you would dictate what salt they shall eat, what clothes they shall\nwear. Why should they put up with such tyranny, and why should we let them?"\n\n"But we have taken to Indian salt and sugar and cloth ourselves."\n\n"You may do as you please to work off your irritation, to keep up your\nfanaticism. You are well off, you need not mind the cost. The poor do not want\nto stand in your way, but you insist on their submitting to your compulsion.\nAs it is, every moment of theirs is a life-and-death struggle for a bare\nliving; you cannot even imagine the difference a few pice means to them--so\nlittle have you in common. You have spent your whole past in a superior\ncompartment, and now you come down to use them as tools for the wreaking of\nyour wrath. I call it cowardly."\n\nThey were all old pupils of my master, so they did not venture to be\ndisrespectful, though they were quivering with indignation. They turned to me.\n"Will you then be the only one, Maharaja, to put obstacles in the way of what\nthe country would achieve?"\n\n"Who am I, that I should dare do such a thing? Would I not rather lay down my\nlife to help it?"\n\nThe M.A. student smiled a crooked smile, as he asked: "May we enquire what you\nare actually doing to help?"\n\n"I have imported Indian mill-made yarn and kept it for sale in my Suksar\nmarket, and also sent bales of it to markets belonging to neighbouring\n_zamindars_."\n\n"But we have been to your market, Maharaja," the same student exclaimed, "and\nfound nobody buying this yarn."\n\n"That is neither my fault nor the fault of my market. It only shows the whole\ncountry has not taken your vow."\n\n"That is not all," my master went on. "It shows that what you have pledged\nyourselves to do is only to pester others. You want dealers, who have not\ntaken your vow, to buy that yarn; weavers, who have not taken your vow, to\nmake it up; then their wares eventually to be foisted on to consumers who,\nalso, have not taken your vow. The method? Your clamour, and the _zamindars\'_\noppression. The result: all righteousness yours, all privations theirs!"\n\n"And may we venture to ask, further, what your share of the privation has\nbeen?" pursued a science student.\n\n"You want to know, do you?" replied my master. "It is Nikhil himself who has\nto buy up that Indian mill yarn; he has had to start a weaving school to get\nit woven; and to judge by his past brilliant business exploits, by the time\nhis cotton fabrics leave the loom their cost will be that of cloth-of-gold; so\nthey will only find a use, perhaps, as curtains for his drawing-room, even\nthough their flimsiness may fail to screen him. When you get tired of your\nvow, you will laugh the loudest at their artistic effect. And if their\nworkmanship is ever truly appreciated at all, it will be by foreigners."\n\nI have known my master all my life, but have never seen him so agitated. I\ncould see that the pain had been silently accumulating in his heart for some\ntime, because of his surpassing love for me, and that his habitual self-\npossession had become secretly undermined to the breaking point.\n\n"You are our elders," said the medical student. "It is unseemly that we should\nbandy words with you. But tell us, pray, finally, are you determined not to\noust foreign articles from your market?"\n\n"I will not," I said, "because they are not mine."\n\n"Because that will cause you a loss!" smiled the M.A. student.\n\n"Because he, whose is the loss, is the best judge," retorted my master.\n\nWith a shout of _Bande Mataram_ they left us.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII](hw26.htm)\n\n'
