In the glimpses we catch of the heroic\nlovers, Sita and Rama, wandering the forest, Sita wears the _sari_ , and\nfollows behind her husband, as she might to-day. No one, I suppose, can tell\nhow old the _sari_ may be. We see it in Egyptian pictures of the goddesses,\nand if we remember that it is essentially a strip of cloth, unsewn, we shall\nfind it also, I think, in Greek sculpture.\n\nThe notion, current for centuries amongst the orthodox, that to wear anything\nstitched was utterly unholy, has kept this garment in its primitive\nsimplicity. Like many perfect things, it withholds its complete loveliness at\nfirst from even the most enthusiastic eye. It takes months of familiarity to\nenable the ordinary observer to appreciate to the full the long curves of the\nveil, the dainty poses of the head, and the exquisite adjustment of every\nmovement to the drapery,\n\np. 17\n\nAt first, perhaps, we feel that the _sari_ is narrow at the ankles, and that\nthe ovoid form, therefore, verges on the bundle." Then it dawns on us that\neven this is beautiful, and that there is, moreover, a variety that at first\nescaped us. It is not drawn so tight, except for some special emergency or\neffort, and in times of leisure it gives to the feet all the freedom of the\nskirt. Now and then a breeze catches the veil, and we get--down here in common\nhuman life--a moment\'s glimpse of the Sistine Madonna.\n\nAubrey Beardsley and Phil May, and the delightful artists of the French\nposter, have not been wrong in their rapturous interpretation of tennis-\nblouses and picture-hats and the modiste\'s fashion-plate. But if we want some\nsoul to gain the vision of the spiritual depths of mere living, to know how\none life is tense with agony and another light with the ease of a summer day,\nto realise for himself the hair\'s-breadth difference that puts eternal\nseparation between the curves of the Mother of Sorrows and the Mother Crowned,\n--if we desire this revelation, we may find it in the Hindu zenana. For there\nwe come upon a dignity and grace, with a superb indifference to great or\nlittle, that lifts the meanest drudgery, and puts it in the matter of\nbeautiful doing on a level with the harvesting of corn or the facing of death.\nOnly Millet in modern Europe has known this\n\np. 18\n\npotentiality of common things. He stands alone, for that brooding presence of\nthe Eternal with which _The Angelus_ is charged is as different from our\nnineteenth-century realism as the stories of Nausicaa and Penelope from _A\nWindow in Thrums_. But Millet never came to India, and even if he had come, he\nalas, would have found himself mere man.\n\nAnd then the colour of the _sari!_ My own experience has been that when a\nthing was just right I have often failed at first to recognise it. I have had\nto grow to it. I used to long for _saris_ without borders. That little line,\nmeandering up and down the figure, seemed a useless interruption of the\ncomposition, a jarring element in the picture; to-day it is like the brush-\nline of a great master, defining and emphasizing the whole.\n\nBut it is not the border only. Whoever knew a Hindu make a mistake in colour?\nDark blue is never blue, but purple. Green is like grass lying in sunlight, or\nshot with rose. Grey is not altogether silver; there is a suggestion of the\nblue rock-pigeon in it too. A check, or a dazzling combination of black and\nwhite, is an outrage impossible to perpetrate.\n\nAnd yet, and yet, is there anything like the radiant purity of the widow\'s\nplain white cloth? Silk for worship, cotton for daily service--but always\nwhite, without a touch of colour. Perhaps\n\np. 19\n\nits charm lies in its associations. The austere simplicity speaks of the\nhighest only. A heart free to embrace the world, a life all consecrated, a\npast whose sorrow makes the present full of giving--these are the secrets that\nthe widow\'s _sari_ tells.\n\nFor it must be understood that this bereavement is regarded in India as a\ndirect call to the religious life. It is the only way in which what is known\nin Catholic countries as "a vocation" can come to the Hindu woman. Her life\nhenceforth is to be given to God, not to man; and this idea, coupled with an\nexaggerated respect for celibacy, gives to the widow, and especially to her\nwho has been a child-widow, a unique position of influence in the household.\nThis feeling of reverence persists long after the sentiments of orthodoxy--\nadmiration for long hours spent in worship and for severe asceticism--have\ndisappeared. Hence it was a modern Hindu, of the school calling itself\nReformed, who said to me, "The most stately garment in India is the white\n_sari_ of the widow."\n\nOf coin-se all ordeals are hard on some members of the community, and there is\nlittle to choose between the injustice of one set of institutions and another.\nI do not know that the Indian woman of the upper classes, doomed to live from\nchildhood without the closest companionship, is\n\np. 20\n\nmore than conventionally conscious of special hardship. Her vocation is none\nof her own choosing, but she often throws her whole heart into it for all\nthat, and that wealth of devotion, amounting to absorption, which she would\nhave bestowed upon her husband, goes into the discipline of her own character.\nAnd what a character that often is! The most ideal woman I have ever known is\nthe orthodox Brahmin widow. And she does not stand alone. In her I have\nlearned to understand the feeling of the Hindu who, having been received in\ndistinguished society in England, turns from all the elegance and high\nbreeding of European womanhood to find something that surpasses these in that\nsimple unlettered dignity and sweetness of her who was his mother.\n\nThe feeling of the Indian family for the little sister who comes home to it a\nnun is often very tender. Just that grieved acquiescence in a higher\nconsecration than common, which we might show to one dear to ourselves, is\ntheirs. In the past it was no unusual thing for the parents and brothers and\nsisters, under these circumstances, to take up all her obligations and share\nthem with her. I know one man in whose childhood this went on until the young\nwidow noticed that only vegetable food was being eaten around her, and herself\nbought fish and cooked it, thus\n\np. 21\n\ninsisting on freeing the others from their self-imposed privation.\n\nThe _ekadasi_ , or one day of fasting, which falls in every fifteen, is indeed\na hardship, and especially so in the hot weather; for not only may no food be\ntaken for twenty-four hours, but not even a drop of water may pass the lips.\nYet even this is not a torture invented to make the wretched still more\nwretched. It was once binding on every good Hindu, and is still retained by\nastonishingly many. I know one Indian prince who keeps it to the letter; and\nthe most conservative class of all--the high-caste widow, the very type of\npiety--naturally clings to it more persistently than others. I have never\nknown a man who did not honestly try to mitigate the force of the observance;\nand I hear that the strictness with which it is kept in Calcutta is unknown\nelsewhere.\n\nI once met a violent agnostic who was friendly to a single text in the Bible:\n"He that will be chief among you, let him be your servant." "That," my friend\nwas fond of saying, "comes true every time." But since I have been in India I\nhave seen it in a new light. It reads now like a picture from Oriental\ndomesticity. Here, among women at least, administration is apt to pass\ndirectly into service. Of course in large community-houses, with their forty\nor fifty persons paying allegiance to one head of the family, the\n\np. 22\n\nmere giving out of stores by the mother-in-law is a serious matter, leaving\nlittle time for regular housework. But even this lady, in the course of the\nday, may pass into the kitchen to cook the food of her husband and herself.\n\nWe shall never understand until we realise that passionate self-abnegation is\nthe root of most things. Custom, it is true, petrifies everything till this\nimpulse may sometimes be hardly conscious. But it is often intensely so. I was\nfeasting late one evening with a rich Hindu family, and noticing that even the\ngentlemen were waiting till I had dined, I made some playful remark to the\ndaughter of the house--whose guest especially I was--about the hardship of\n_her_ part in eating last of all. "Oh," she said, drawing back hurriedly, as\nif touched on a tender point, "but we like it best so." For this reason, when\nasked to breakfast, one should never, I think, be late. Whatever the hour of\none\'s arrival and departure, one may be sure that the hostess will not taste\nfood till it is past.\n\nOld prejudices, however, are passing away, and it is now no uncommon thing for\na man to begin the day with a cup of tea, while almost all the children of\nthose who can afford it have a sweetmeat and a glass of milk on waking up. But\nit is rare indeed for the mother to permit herself the luxuries that she\ndispenses to those around\n\np. 23\n\nher. And even to this extent many families would refuse to go.\n\nThe first duty of the day is the cleaning of one\'s own room and the zenana\ndepartment generally. No doubt very rich persons have this done by women\nservants, but in most houses it is the work of the owner of the room and of\nher young daughters-in-law. And almost every lady, however rich, does\nsomething, either her husband\'s room or the family chapel, with her own hands.\nThis happens at somewhere near four o\'clock. I have never succeeded in rising\nso early that the rest of the house was still uncleansed.\n\nThe next proceeding is that kind of devotion known as meditation. This lasts\nfor at least an hour, and while it is in progress the dawn comes. Then there\nis the visit to the Ganges for one of the many daily baths, with perhaps the\nreading of some sacred book till it is time to go. Next, the worship, with all\nits ritual, that comes nearest to our family prayers, and after all this a\nmeal. It may be necessary to cook this meal with one\'s own hands before\neating. Or beggars may come at the last minute, and then the whole of the food\nwill be given to them, and the lady of the house will go on waiting till her\nshare is once more ready. In this way it is often two o\'clock, and I have\nheard of its being eleven at night, before the head of a large household will\n\np. 24\n\nbreakfast, and this would not count as an austerity.\n\nIt is after this meal, about half-past twelve or one o\'clock, that the\npleasures of life begin for the zenana lady. First, she has a couple of hours\'\nsleep. She sadly needs it. Then she sits up, reads, talks, possibly sews a\nlittle (though this is rare), and enjoys life, Towards the end of the\nafternoon one notices that every right hand is covered with a little bag, out\nof which the first finger protrudes, and the ladies round one have a\npreoccupied air. They are telling their beads, which are covered up, inside\nthe little bags. This habit of covering the rosary interests me much, for I am\ntold that the Buddhists of Ceylon, who wear their beads on the right wrist,\nhide them under a strip of cloth, like the maniple of Christian ritual. No one\nappears to attach any meaning to the custom.\n\nSome hundreds of the names of God have thus been said--or, as we should put\nit, the Name has been said some hundreds of times--when dusk falls, and a\nservant passes the door bearing a lamp. At once all rise and prostrate\nthemselves before some sacred picture in the room, and once more the whole\nhousehold passes, with various beautiful preliminaries of salutation to the\nGanges, to the _tulsi_ plant, and so on, to worship, again in the form of\nmeditation. It\n\np. 25\n\nis the time called candle-light or the hour of peace.\n\nIt is quite late before the ladies eat for the second time, and in the\npleasant hour or two between, friends and neighbours, attended by female\nservants bearing lanterns, may slip in for a chat. By half-past nine all have\ngone, and at ten or shortly after, bathing and supper are alike finished, and\neveryone retires for the night.\n\nSuch is an ideal day for a woman of the upper classes. Where there are no\nservants, labour has to be carried to its remotest subdivision. One daughter-\nin-law has charge of all the bread-making; another boils the rice and looks\nafter the potatoes; and so on. And if, in addition to this, there are\nchildren, endless ablutions "by drowning in a tank" (to quote a friend\'s\npicturesque expression) add to their mother\'s cares. From early dawn till late\nat night there is not an idle moment. What a comfort that for us all, the\nworld over--\n\n"Be the day weary, be the day long,  \n   At last it ringeth to evensong!\'\'\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Sacred Year](seh09.htm)\n\n'
