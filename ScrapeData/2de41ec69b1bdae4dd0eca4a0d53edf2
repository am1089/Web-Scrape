Now the animal sacrifice means\ncattle: thus, when he performs the animal sacrifice (pa _s_ ubandha, the\nbinding of the animal), it is in order that he may be possessed of cattle. Let\nhim perform it at his home, thinking, 'I will bind (attach) cattle to my\nhome.' Let him perform it in the season of abundant fodder, thinking, 'I will\nbind to myself cattle in a season of abundant fodder.' For, whilst he is\noffering 2, the Sacrificer's fires become worn out, and so does the\nSacrificer, along with the worn-out fires, and along with the Sacrificer his\nhouse and cattle.\n\n11:7:1:22\\. And when he performs the animal sacrifice, he renews his fires,\nand so, along with the renewal of his fires, does the Sacrificer (renew\nhimself), and along with the Sacrificer his house and cattle. And beneficial\nto life, indeed, is that redemption of his\n\np. 119\n\nown self 1; for whilst he is offering the Sacrificer's fires long for flesh;\nthey set their minds on the Sacrificer and harbour designs on him. In other\nfires 2 people do indeed cook any kind of meat, but these (sacrificial fires)\nhave no desire for any other flesh but this (sacrificial animal), and for him\nto whom they belong.\n\n11:7:1:33\\. Now, when he performs the animal offering. he thereby redeems\nhimself--male by male, for the victim is a male, and the Sacrificer is a male.\nAnd this, indeed, to wit, flesh, is the best kind of food: he thus becomes an\neater of the best kind of food. Let not a year pass by for him without his\noffering; for the year means life: it is thus immortal life he thereby confers\nupon himself.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[118:1](sbe44037.htm#fr_365) Whilst a full account is given in the third Ka\n_n_ _d_ a (part ii, p. 162 seqq.) of the animal sacrifice performed on the day\nbefore the Soma-sacrifice, the Brahma _n_ a, in the last two adhyayas of the\npresent Ka _n_ _d_ a, touches on certain features in which the performance of\nthe animal sacrifice of the pressing-day differs from that of the preceding\nday.\n\n[118:2](sbe44037.htm#fr_366) Viz. the Agnihotra every morning and evening.\n\n[119:1](sbe44037.htm#fr_367) That is, the ransoming of one's own life from the\nsacrificial fires, by offering an animal victim to them in lieu of his own\nself.\n\n[119:2](sbe44037.htm#fr_368) That is, in ordinary, culinary fires.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 7, 2.
