Bear manfully what is thy lot to bear;\nthat which comes to thy hand to be done, do with full strength and fear not.\nForget not that I, the giver of manhood, the giver of womanhood, the holder of\nvictory, am thy Mother.\n\nThink not life is serious! What is destiny but thy Mother's play? Come, be My\nplayfellow awhile,--meet all happenings merrily.\n\nMurmurest thou of need of purpose? Think'st thou the ball is purposeless, with\nwhich the Mother plays? Know'st thou not that Her toy is a thunderbolt,\ncharged with power to shatter the worlds, at the turn of Her wrist? Ask not of\nplans. Needs the arrow any plan when it is loosed from the bow? Such art thou.\nWhen the life is lived, the plan will stand revealed. Till then, O child of\ntime, know nothing!\n\nMy sport is unerring. For that alone set forth on the day's journey. Think it\nwas for _My_ pleasure thou\n\np. 86\n\ncamest forth into the world, and for that again, when night falls, and My\ndesire is accomplished, I shall withdraw thee to My rest. Ask nothing. See\nnothing. Plan nothing. Let My will flow through thee, as the ocean through an\nempty shell.\n\nBut this thing understand. Not one movement shall be in vain. Not one effort\nshall fail at last. The dream shall be less, not greater, than the deed. Thou\nshalt go here or there for some petty reason, and thy going shall subserve\ngreat ends. Thou shalt meet and speak with many, but some few shall be Mine\nfrom the beginning. With these thou shall exchange a secret sign, and they\nshall follow with thee.\n\n\n\nAnd that sign?\n\n\n\nDeep in the heart of hearts of Mine own flashes the sacrificial knife of Kali.\nWorshippers of the Mother are they from their birth in Her incarnation of the\nsword.\n\np. 87\n\n[paragraph continues] Lovers of death are they,--not lovers of life--and of\nstorm and stress.\n\nSuch shall come to thee with torch unlit, for fire. My voice cries out over\nthe teeming earth for lives, for the lives and blood of the crowned kings of\nmen. Remember that I Who cry have shown also the way to answer. For of every\nkind has the mother been the first, for [protection](errata.htm#4) of her\nflock, to leap to death.\n\nReligion, called by whatever name; has been ever the love of death. But to-day\nthe flame of renunciation shall be lighted in My lands and consume men with a\n[passion](errata.htm#5) beyond control of thought. Then shall My people thirst\nfor self-sacrifice as others for enjoyment. Then shall labour and suffering\nand service be counted sweet instead of bitter. For this age is great in time,\nand I, even I, Kali, am the Mother of the nations.\n\nShrink not from defeat, embrace despair. Pain is not different from pleasure,\nif I will both. Rejoice\n\np. 88\n\ntherefore, when thou comest to the place of tears, and see Me smile. At such\nspots do I keep My tryst with men, and fold them deep into My heart.\n\nUproot every interest that would conflict with Mine. Neither love, nor\nfriendship, nor comfort, nor home, may make its voice heard when I speak. Pass\nfrom a palace to plunge into the ocean of terror,--from the chamber of ease to\nstand guard in a burning city. Know that as the one is unreal, so also is the\nother. Meet fate with a smile.\n\nLook for no mercy for thyself, and I shall make thee bearer of great vessels\nof mercy to others. Accept bravely thine own darkness and thy lamp shall cheer\nmany. Fulfil gladly the meanest service, and leave high places unsought.\n\nBe steadfast in the toil I set thee. Weave well the warp into the woof. Shrink\nfrom no demand that the task makes on thee. Feel no responsibility. Ask for no\nreward.\n\nStrong, fearless, resolute,--when the sun sets, and the game is clone,\n\np. 89\n\nthou shalt know well, little one, that I, Kali, the giver of manhood, the\ngiver of womanhood, and the withholder of victory, am thy Mother.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: A Visit to Dukineshwar](ktm06.htm)\n\n"
