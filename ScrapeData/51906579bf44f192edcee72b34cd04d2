And on account of Sm _ri_ ti.\n\nSm _ri_ ti also declares the difference of the embodied Self\n\np. 113\n\nand the highest Self, viz. Bha. Gita XVIII, 61, 'The Lord, O Ar _g_ una, is\nseated in the heart of all beings, driving round by his magical power all\nbeings (as if they were) mounted on a machine.'\n\nBut what, it may be asked, is that so-called embodied Self different from the\nhighest Self which is to be set aside according to the preceding Sutras? _S_\nruti passages, as well as Sm _ri_ ti, expressly deny that there is any Self\napart from the highest Self; compare, for instance, B _ri_. Up. 111, 7, 23,\n'There is no other seer but he; there is no other hearer but he;' and Bha.\nGita XIII, 2, 'And know me also, O Bharata, to be the kshetra _g \xc3\xb1_a in all\nkshetras.'\n\nTrue, we reply, (there is in reality one universal Self only.) But the highest\nSelf in so far as it is limited by its adjuncts, viz. the body, the senses,\nand the mind (mano-buddhi), is, by the ignorant, spoken of as if it were\nembodied. Similarly the ether, although in reality unlimited, appears limited\nowing to certain adjuncts, such as jars and other vessels. With regard to this\n(unreal limitation of the one Self) the distinction of objects of activity and\nof agents may be practically assumed, as long as we have not learned--from the\npassage, 'That art thou'--that the Self is one only. As soon, however, as we\ngrasp the truth that there is only one universal Self, there is an end to the\nwhole practical view of the world with its distinction of bondage, final\nrelease, and the like.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 7](sbe34044.htm)\n\n"
