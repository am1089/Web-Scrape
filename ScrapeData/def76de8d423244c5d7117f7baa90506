(The released soul abides) in non-division (from the highest Self);\nbecause that is seen from scripture.\n\nA doubt here arises whether that soul of which the text says, 'Having entered\nthe highest light it manifests itself by its true nature,' remains separate\nfrom the highest Self, or abides in the state of non-division from it.--\nSomebody might be inclined to think that--because in the passage, 'He moves\nabout there,' a distinction is made between the abode and him who abides; and\nbecause the clause, 'Having entered the highest light,' mentions an agent and\nan object (of the agent's activity)--the soul remains distinct from the\nhighest Self.--This view the Sutra sets aside. The released soul is non-\nseparate from the highest Self.--Why so?--Because\n\np. 408\n\nthat is seen from scripture. For passages such as 'Thou art that' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVI, 8, 7); 'I am Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10);--Where he sees nothing else'\n( _Kh_. Up. VII, 24, 1); 'But there is then nothing second, nothing else\ndifferent that he could see' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 23), show that the highest\nSelf abides in the state of non-division. And the fruit must be assumed to\ncorrespond to the cognition, according to what was explained under IV, 3, 15.\nAnd also such passages as 'Just as pure water poured into pure water remains\nthe same, thus, O Gautama, is the Self of a thinker who knows' (Ka. Up. II, 4,\n15), whose object it is to describe the nature of the released soul, declare\nthat there is non-separation only. The same follows from the comparisons (of\nthe soul entering Brahman) to rivers falling into the sea. Passages where\nseparation (of abode and abiding thing, &c.) is expressed, may be explained\nas, in a secondary sense, expressing non-separation; so e.g. _Kh_. Up. VII.\n24, 1, 'In what does the Infinite rest?--In its own greatness;' and _Kh_. Up.\nVII, 25, 2, 'Loving the Self, playing with the Self.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 5](sbe38322.htm)\n\n"
