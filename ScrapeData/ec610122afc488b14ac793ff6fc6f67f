Many among the readers of the book\nwere aware that its author stood in a unique relation to the Indian people:\nthat she had identified herself without reserve with their life and been\ndedicated wholly to their service; while not a few were assured that she was\ndestined to carry forward the task thus brilliantly begun of revealing the\ninner side of Eastern society to the West. But this was not to be. Two years\nago she died, with her work in India,\n\np. viii\n\nas it seemed to those who knew her best and had most reason to hope greatly,\nhardly more than envisaged and planned.\n\n\n\nMargaret Noble, known for some twelve years to multitudes of people throughout\nIndia as Sister Nivedita, was of Irish parentage and birth, and was born at\nDungannon, Co. Tyrone, in 1867. Very soon afterwards her father, Samuel\nRichmond Noble, entered the Lancashire Independent College, in preparation for\nthe Congregational ministry, but did not live to fulfil his early promise.\nMargaret, his elder daughter, passed from school in the north of England to a\nteacher\'s training, and was fortunate enough to become acquainted in London\nwith some of the most enthusiastic apostles of the New Education. Her\npractical experience was gained as teacher in various girls\' schools, and more\nespecially in association with a Dutch lady who had established in a suburb of\nSouth London a school of a thoroughly modern type. In 1892, being then in her\ntwenty-fifth year, she opened at Wimbledon a school of her own in which she\nstrove to give expression to the broad and fine conception of girls\' education\nwith which then and afterwards she was identified. At Wimbledon, too, she was\nthe centre of a group of friends, eager inquirers into everything, given to\n\np. ix\n\nthe discussion of books, ethics, and society with the confident energy of\nyouth, and beginning in several directions social work which has since borne\nvaried fruit. Always, however, with Margaret Noble, intellectual inquiry was\nimmediately related to what she regarded as her proper work--education; and\nshe was one of the most active of those, mostly, like herself, concerned with\nthe newer applications of educational theory, who, twenty years or so ago,\nfounded the Sesame Club, the earliest in this country of those social centres\nfor men and women which have since so largely multiplied.\n\nBusy with her school and kindred schemes, abounding in life, a keen reader and\nthinker, with a continually widening circle of friends--such she was in 1895,\nwhen there came into her life the influence which in a few months altered its\nwhole current and purpose.\n\n\n\nIt was, as she has recorded in _The Master as I Saw Him_ , at a drawing-room\nmeeting in November of the year just mentioned that Margaret Noble for the\nfirst time met the Swami Vivekananda, who had been recognised by many as a\nchallenging figure in the London of that time. He had appeared before the\nParliament of Religions, held during the Chicago Exhibition of 1893, as the\nfirst of the modern missionaries\n\np. x\n\nof Hinduism to the Western world. He was unknown and had come unheralded; but\nhis discourse--the one incident of that curious assembly that is remembered\nto-day--was epoch-marking. From it must be dated the widespread interest in\nIndian thought and religion, and especially in the philosophy of Vedanta,\nwhich has been so unmistakable a feature of educated America during the past\ntwo decades.\n\nYou will hear from those who came within the scope of this masterful teacher\'s\ninfluence many differing estimates of the effect created by his personality\nand speech. Before leaving India, he had been known as the specially chosen\ndisciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the Bengali saint who had lived in a\ntemple-garden at Dakshineshwar, on the river a few miles above Calcutta, and\nwhose life and sayings were made known to European readers through one of Max-\nMuller\'s later books. To Sister Nivedita herself the life lived by Ramakrishna\nand extended and interpreted by his chief follower summed up the Hindu\nconsciousness, and stood for the final proof of "the entire sufficiency of any\nsingle creed or conception to lead the soul to God as its true goal."\n\n"Henceforth," she wrote, "it is not true that each form of life or worship is\ntolerated or understood by the Hindu mind: each form is justified, welcomed,\nset\n\np. xi\n\nup for its passionate loving, for evermore. Henceforth, the supreme crime for\nany follower of any Indian sect, whether orthodox or modern, philosophic or\npopular, shall be the criticism of any other, as if it were without the bounds\nof the Eternal Faith."\n\nBut Ramakrishna was a pure devotee: his concern was simply the realisation in\nthe individual of the Divine. Vivekananda was a man of action. Not only did he\ncarry westward the message of Vedantism, but he had dreams of a renewal of the\nlife of India through the infusion of fresh knowledge and renascent ideals. He\nstood entirely aloof from politics: yet it is hardly surprising that his\nyounger followers should have acclaimed him as something more than a teacher\nof Vedantism--as, in truth, the prophet of New India in a sense which, it\nseems quite certain, he never for a moment intended.\n\n\n\nThe Swami left America for England in August 1895, and a few weeks later he\nhad begun lecturing in London. Miss Noble had few opportunities of hearing him\nbefore his return to America during the winter, but in the spring of 1896 he\nwas back in London, and was holding a class in the house of an English friend\nin St. George\'s Road, near Victoria Station. There she was a constant and for\na time a hostile and contentious hearer. Always passionately religious, she\nhad in her girlhood\n\np. xii\n\nbecome a member of the Anglican Church and was deeply responsive to its ritual\nand sentiment. But the doctrines of orthodoxy had long since ceased to hold\nher intelligence; and at twenty-eight, in the full tide of her manifold\nintellectual interests, she was, it may be supposed, as completely detached\nfrom the religious beliefs of her childhood as from the occult ideas by which\nat that time some among her friends were impressed. The message of Swami\nVivekananda went to the mark, little as she recognised this at the time. She\ndisputed his assertions, fought him in the discussion class, provided indeed\nthe strongest antagonism which he had to meet at any of his London gatherings.\nBut it is clear that from the first his influence was winning. About his\nteaching there was nothing that could be associated with any sect or special\ndoctrine. Although himself obeying the impulse and fulfilling the purpose of\nhis master Ramakrishna, he dealt always impersonally with the body of truth\ncommon to all religions, and dwelt upon the necessity, especially in the\npresent stage of the world\'s history, for the exchange of ideals between\npeoples, and especially between East and West. He was, too, much more than a\npreacher. While glorifying the Indian past and the ancient contribution of his\npeople to the intellectual wealth of the world, he was a man of modern\noutlook, incessantly framing\n\np. xiii\n\nconcrete schemes for the social regeneration of India. He was bent upon the\nfirm establishment of the Order of Ramakrishna, of which he was the head--an\norder which he designed not for contemplation alone, but for social service;\nhe would, if he could, have commanded vast resources for educational\nenterprise; and he was resolved to initiate some definite agency for the\neducation of Indian women. This last was the part of his programme which, from\nan early stage of their acquaintance, Swami Vivekananda seems to have marked\nout as the special work of Margaret Noble; and before he left England, at the\nend of 1896, she had come to recognise the call. A year later she sailed for\nIndia, landed at Calcutta in the beginning of 1898, and made her home with\nsome American friends at Belur, on the river a short distance from the city,\nwhere was established the headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission. Soon after\nher arrival in Bengal she was admitted to the Order by the name of Nivedita\n(the Dedicated)--thereafter the name by which she was known, far beyond the\nbounds of her personal activity.\n\n\n\nFrom May to October of her first year in India the Swami, Sister Nivedita, and\nthree other Western women travelled together in the North-West, in Kumaon and\nKashmir. The tour, which included a pilgrimage to the famous shrine of\nAmarnath,\n\np. xiv\n\nwas rich in experience, afterwards recorded in _The Master as I Saw Him_. It\ngave her, as she said in that book, glimpses of "a great religious life of the\nancient order, living itself out amidst the full and torturing consciousness\nof all the anomalies and perplexities of the modern transition." These\nfruitful journeyings ended in the autumn of 1898, and then it was that Sister\nNivedita endeavoured to carry out her project for an Indian school in the\nHindu quarter of Calcutta. For reasons which everyone who knows a little of\nthe world of orthodox Hinduism will appreciate, the experiment was attended\nwith much difficulty, and in the course of a few months it was abandoned in\norder that new means and opportunities might be found. In June 1899,\naccompanied by Vivekananda, Sister Nivedita left Calcutta for Europe, and\nduring the autumn they were fellow-guests in the house of some invaluable\nAmerican friends on the Hudson River. The Swami returned to India at the close\nof 1900. This period of a year and a half furnished Sister Nivedita with most\nof the opportunities of companionship and discussion which gave her the\nspecial point of view which for the rest of her life marked her interpretation\nof Indian life and thought. She remained in England until the beginning of\n1902, when she resumed her work in Calcutta under conditions much more\nfavourable\n\np. xv\n\nto success than those which had accompanied its beginning. But the personal\nassociation from which it had sprung was then almost at an end. Swami\nVivekananda died at Belur on July 4, 1902. A few months afterwards Sister\nNivedita was joined by an American colleague, Miss Christine Greenstidel, and\ntogether they entered upon the work of enlarging the scope of the school in\nBose Para Lane, Bagh Bazar. In the early part of the year 1905 a dangerous\nillness befel Sister Nivedita, and this was followed, in the autumn of 1906,\nby a long spell of malarial fever, the result of the visit of inquiry and\nservice, described in this volume, which she paid during the rainy season of\nthat year to Eastern Bengal, where the people were suffering miserably from\nfamine and flood. The terrible strain of these two illnesses broke down her\nmagnificent constitution, and physically she was never the same again. The\nlast three years of her life were largely spent in England and America. She\nreturned finally to India in the spring of 1911, and was staying for the\ncustomary autumn holiday at Darjeeling when, on October 13, she died--a\nfortnight before the close of her forty-fourth year. Indian friends only, and\nthose the most devoted, were with her at the last; and the body was given to\nthe fire with the Hindu rites of which she had so often spoken and written.\n\np. xvi\n\nWhen people asked, as they constantly did, what Sister Nivedita was doing in\nIndia, her own answer was always simple. She was a teacher, and in India she\nwas doing nothing else than applying the principles which she had learned from\nher own instructors in Europe. The Swami Vivekananda\'s practical aims had been\npredominantly educational, and his English disciple went to India primarily\nunder the belief that her own part in the far-reaching work to which he had\nset his hand was to make a school, in an Indian home, where the methods and\nideals of the modern educationist might be brought within the cloistral domain\nof the Eastern wife and mother. Beginning as a tiny kindergarten, the school\ngrew steadily until it had a large attendance of little Hindu girls up to the\nmarriageable age, and a still larger number of married women and widows. As\nconducted by Sister Nivedita and her colleague, the school involved no\nuprooting from familiar surroundings. Neither child nor woman was taken from\nher home into a foreign world; her schooling demanded only a daily migration\nfrom one home to another in the same lane or ward. The principle was, as\nSister Nivedita herself expressed it, by means of familiar factors of her\ndaily life so to educate the Indian girl as to enable her to realise those\nends which are themselves integral aspirations of that life. There was\n\np. xvii\n\nno attempt to convert her to any religious or social system alien from her\nown; but rather, by means of her own customs and traditions, to develop her in\nharmony with Indian ideals, the teachers themselves following those ideals as\nfar as they could be made practicable. It appeared to some that Sister\nNivedita, alike in her school and in the zenana, was in certain respects a\nreactionary influence--upholding the _purdah_ and child marriage and perpetual\nwidowhood as institutions essential to the preservation of the society which\nshe had learned to admire. But she was far indeed from seeking to maintain the\nold unchanged. "Under the old scheme," she said, "women found not only a\ndiscipline but a career"; yet she saw that this old scheme was a preparation\nand an opportunity fitted only to the soil in which it grew. To the Indian as\nto the European woman the modern revolution has brought a" narrowing of her\nlot, and has wrought havoc with the traditional skill in handicraft. "To-day\nevery Indian woman can cook, and that well. But she cannot sew, and she has\nnothing but gossip and prayer, when the afternoon siesta is over, wherewith to\noccupy her leisure." Hence Sister Nivedita and her colleague found it\nnecessary to teach the wives and widows needlework of various kinds. But it\nmay well be that they themselves learned more of the irresistible movement of\nthe modern spirit\n\np. xviii\n\nin the orthodox world of Hinduism, when they found themselves met by an\ninsistent demand from the young wives to be taught English so that they might\nbecome in some real sense the companions of their husbands.\n\nThe success that attended the Vivekananda school in Bagh Bazar was not of the\nresounding kind; but it was a most noteworthy sign of the times; and in the\nlater years of Sister Nivedita\'s life it was prevented only by the narrow\nmeans possessed by the Sisters from developing into a great institution. Its\ninfluence, however, could never have been measured by the number of its pupils\nor the amount of regular teaching done within the modest rooms and courts\nwhich are described in the opening chapters of this book. How long it took\nSister Nivedita to conquer the suspicions of the quiet, proud, and intensely\nself-respecting people of Bagh Bazar I have no means of knowing: I can speak\nonly of what I saw when, some two or three years after she had made her home\namong them, I had opportunities of observing her among the surroundings into\nwhich she fitted so perfectly. She was then entirely accepted by her Hindu\nneighbours. All their doors were open to her. In the bazaars and lanes and by\nthe riverside everybody knew her, and she would be saluted as she passed with\nan affectionate reverence which was beautiful\n\np. xix\n\nand touching to see. The House of the Sisters was known of all; not as a\nschool merely, but as a centre of unfailing friendliness and succour. The\npeople remembered how, when the plague broke out among them, Sister Nivedita\nhad joined with the brethren of the Order of Ramakrishna in a crusade of\nnursing and sanative cleansing. And in times when there was no spectacular\ncall of pestilence or flood, there went out from her house a constant stream\nof social and personal service. For this, as Sister Nivedita always\nmaintained, there was an ever-increasing call under the economic pressure upon\nthe class which, with its more or less of English education, was rendering\nclerical and professional service to the ruling power.\n\n\n\nBeginning thus, with the conviction that the European can work fruitfully in\nIndia only upon the basis of perfect co-operation with the children of the\nsoil, Sister Nivedita was led to make the great renunciation. The land to\nwhose service she had devoted herself made an overwhelming appeal to her--its\nhistory and thought, its people and their life, its present state in\nsubjection and social transition. There could be no partial surrender with\nher: she gave herself utterly. Accepting the lot of the Indian woman, living\nas her neighbours lived, in a little native house severely\n\np. xx\n\ndevoid of all inessentials, she worked among them in all seasons--when the\nsplendid cold weather of Bengal gave place to the terrific heat, and this in\nturn to the rains which every year made the narrow streets of the quarter into\nrivulets. "Never have I known such complete self-effacement," wrote her\nclosest Indian woman friend:\n\n"All the rare gifts that opened out a great career for her in the West she\nlaid at the service of our motherland. . . . She had so completely identified\nherself with us that I never heard her use phrases like \'Indian need\' or\nIndian women\': it was always \'our need,\' \'our women.\' She was never as an\noutsider who came to help, but one of us who was striving and groping about to\nfind salvation." 1\n\nIt needs not to be said that this was the secret of her extraordinary power.\nIndia instinctively understands every form of renunciation, and it would, I\nconceive, be impossible to exaggerate the impression made by this life of\nabsolute sincerity and self-dedication, with its rejoicing acceptance of the\nausterity and simplicity of the old Indian order. But this, of course, was not\nall. No one who knows the India of the past decade will need to be told that\nthe influence of her ideal and example went out from the little house in Bagh\nBazar in ever-widening circles as the\n\np. xxi\n\nyears went on. Sister Nivedita was the most fervent and convinced of\nNationalists: the word continually on her lips was Nationality. She had\nunbounded faith in the reserve power of the Indian people, and her call to the\nyounger generation was a ringing challenge to them to rise, not only to the\nheight of the past, but to the demand of the future. Unsparing she could be,\nat times, in criticising the Indian character; but she never bated a jot of\nher belief in the certainty of its triumph, and it went hard with anyone,\nEuropean or Asiatic, who offered any kind of insult or disparagement to the\npeople of her adoption. The beginning of her work in India coincided with a\nstage of extraordinary deadness in public and intellectual life. But the\nchange was already on the way, and she had the joy of seeing the growth of a\nnew spirit, the rapid formation of new ideals, the dawn, as she believed, of a\nrenascent national life and power. The influences that have gone to the\nshaping of the New India are still obscure; but this may be said with complete\nassurance, that among them all there has been no single factor that has\nsurpassed, or equalled, the character and life and words of Margaret Noble.\n\n\n\nThere were no rules of exclusion in the House of the Sisters, provided only\nthat the privileged\n\np. xxii\n\nmale visitor did not intrude during the hours given up to the orthodox Hindu\nladies who came for tuition in needlework and English. And to one engaged\nthroughout the week in the merciless daily labour that generally falls upon\nthe Englishman in India, the Sundays in Bose Para Lane were a refreshment and\na stimulus the memory of which is never likely to pass away. Breakfast was\nserved with the extreme of simplicity on the little veranda, and the group\nwould not break up until long after the morning sun had become too hot for a\ncomfortable journey back through the blazing streets. Her house was a\nwonderful rendezvous. Not often did one meet a Western visitor, save at those\ntimes when an English or American friend would be making a stay in Calcutta;\nbut nowhere else, so far as my experience went, was there an opportunity of\nmaking acquaintance with so many interesting types of the Indian world. There\nwould come members of Council and leaders in the public affairs of Bengal;\nIndian artists, men of letters, men of science; orators, teachers,\njournalists, students; frequently a travelled member of the Order of\nRamakrishna, occasionally a wandering scholar, not seldom a public man or\nleader of religion from a far province. The experience was beyond expression\ndelightful, and its influence, you knew, was to be felt along many lines.\n\np. xxiii\n\nThere was a time, in the years which followed her return from the first of her\nlong visits to the West, when it seemed likely that Sister Nivedita would\ndevelop into a regular and constant speaker. She gave frequent addresses, and\nnot in Calcutta alone. In the autumn of 1902 she made a tour in Western India,\nwhere she lectured to large audiences. This was succeeded by a similar tour in\nthe Madras Presidency during the same winter, and when at home she was\nconstantly in request as a speaker at meetings large and small. Latterly,\nhowever, she showed a disposition to confine her activities to writing and to\ndirect contact with those who were making towards the New India of which she\ndreamed. Many of her friends approved this change of plan; but it has always\nseemed to me that public speech gave her the opportunity most adapted to the\ndelivery of her message. She varied greatly, it is true, on the platform.\nAlways rather at the mercy of a too difficult thesis, given to the use of\nsocio-philosophic terms, and following a too compressed method of exposition,\nshe not infrequently soared beyond the comprehension of her audience. She\nspoke least successfully when under the strain of an important occasion; most\nbrilliantly when responding to the immediate stimulus of a challenge in debate\nor of a suggestion or incident arising naturally in the meeting. One thinks of\nher at\n\np. xxiv\n\nher best (and how often she was so!) addressing some crowded gathering in the\nyears before her health was broken and before there came upon her that sense\nof "the petty done, the undone vast," in which latterly she seemed to abide.\nAnd from a score or so of occasions, differing greatly in circumstances, I\nrecall especially two as showing her in most characteristic fashion.\n\nThe first was during the rainy season of 1902, when she cut short a Sunday\nevening call at Bagh Bazar by saying that she was due at a lecture. She\nallowed me to accompany her, and we went to a Bengali school in the university\nquarter. The quadrangle was densely crowded with youths and men, and on a dais\nwas seated, alongside the symbolic _tulsi_ plant, a _Katkak_ (one of the last\nsurvivals of the ancient minstrels), who as we entered began a recital from\nthe Ramayana. For an hour or so he continued, [declaiming](errata.htm#0) and\nintoning, while his hearers listened enrapt and a friendly interpreter\nexplained to me, the one outsider present, the movement of the story. When the\nrecital was finished Sister Nivedita rose to speak, without any preliminary\n(she always disliked the intrusion of a chairman). She spoke, as always, from\nthe feeling of the moment as regards the expression, from long reflection and\nconviction as regards the substance. And she began with a reference to the\nrecital to which they\n\np. xxv\n\nhad just been listening, pointing her moral swiftly and powerfully. Did they,\nshe asked, think it was enough to learn and admire the ancient stories and to\nglory in the ideals which had inspired the men and women of early India?\n"Believe me, that is nothing. The Ramayana is not something that came once for\nall, from a society that is dead and gone; it is something springing ever from\nthe living heart of a people. Our word to the young Indian to-day is: Make\nyour own Ramayana, not in written stories, but in service and achievement for\nthe motherland."\n\nThe other occasion, a year or two later, was one in which, at the first\nglance, she seemed ex-extraordinarily "out of the picture." The hall of the\nDalhousie Institute, Calcutta, was filled with a mixed audience, mostly\nIndian, for as odd a purpose as could well be imagined in that country--to\nhear a debate on Marriage _versus_ Celibacy. The discussion had been arranged,\nas an anniversary treat, by the committee of a Bengali public library, and the\nlast of the Military Members of the Viceroy\'s Council (Sir Edmond Elles) was\nin the chair. The case for celibacy was stated by the late Sir Edward Law, the\nFinance Minister; the case for marriage by an elderly Parsee member of the\nIndian Civil Service. Both openers gave play to the easy facetiousness which\nis commonly deemed appropriate to the\n\np. xxvi\n\npublic discussion of this and kindred subjects, and the meeting had reached a\nlow ebb when, towards the end, Sir Edmond Elles called upon Sister Nivedita,\nwho was seated on the platform with an English woman friend. She began slowly,\nwith a courteous half-humorous rebuke to the chairman, and then in a few\npointed and searching sentences outlined the conception of wifehood as\nrevealed in Eastern tradition. Developing this, and incidentally crushing some\ncriticism by a previous speaker of the Western woman who makes a career for\nherself outside marriage, she gave a brilliant little exposition of the\ncontrasted and complementary views of the place of woman as mother and as\nindividual. It was marvellously skilful, complete, and convincing, and the\nwhole thing occupied a bare ten minutes. But what interested one even more\nthan the perfection of the speech was the way in which the tone of the meeting\nwas transformed by the touchstone of her dominating spirit. Many times, before\nand after that, I heard her speak: to groups of students, or in the Calcutta\nTown Hall before a great audience, on her one absorbing theme--the religion of\nNationalism; to English gatherings in hall or church or drawing-room. And I\nhave thought, and still think, that her gift of speech was something which,\nwhen fully exercised, I have never known surpassed--so fine and sure was it\n\np. xxvii\n\nin form, so deeply impassioned, of such flashing and undaunted sincerity.\n\nIt cannot, perhaps, be said that any of her books fully represent the strength\nand range of her mind, notwithstanding the fine literary faculty which was\nundoubtedly hers. As with her speaking so with her writing: it was most\neffective when it came out in attack or controversy. There are things buried\nin Indian newspapers and magazines which revealed an extraordinary power of\ndirect and resonant expression, and a grip of argument and affairs which she\nwould not have blamed one for praising as masculine. And yet her books, though\nso much less wonderful than herself, are surely destined for a larger public\nthan they have yet reached. _Kali the Mother_ , the little volume in which she\ngave the firstfruits of her Indian studies under Vivekananda, showed something\nof her interpretative faculty, although its title and sentiment were startling\nto those English readers who knew only the ordinary European view of the\n"bloody goddess." Into _The Web of Indian Life_ she put, as her friends knew,\nall the force of her mind and all the intensity of her faith. The result was\nmoving and powerful, if unequal: it gave an earnest of what the world might\nhave expected from her had she lived to write the interpretation of Indian\ndomestic life and the social structure of Hinduism to which undoubtedly\n\np. xxviii\n\nshe would have devoted herself. Her later books display a steady advance in\nmastery of expression. In _Cradle Tales of Hinduism_ she retold a number of\nthe heroic stories of which she made constant use in her lessons and\naddresses; and in _The Master as I Saw Him_ , the last to be published in her\nlifetime, she gave a picture of the Swami Vivekananda as she had come to know\nhim during the seven years of their association. The task of writing the Life\nof the teacher to whom she owed the purpose and direction of her own activity,\nshe left to other hands.\n\n\n\nNo effort has been made in the foregoing rough sketch to portray the\npersonality, the rare and splendid and dauntless spirit, that was Margaret\nNoble. To do this would be to attempt the impossible. So much of the reality\nas can be conveyed to those who did not know her will be contained in a\ncollection of Letters and Memorials, which, it is hoped, may before long be\nbrought together. And in the meantime I am enabled to quote a few brief\ntributes from some who, in England or India, were associated in one way or\nanother with her work and her ideal.\n\nNothing that she touched remained commonplace; her letters, much more than her\nbooks, disclose the temper and genius that were known to her friends and\nfellow-workers. Her dominant notes\n\np. xxix\n\nwere clarity and sincerity and an incomparable vitality. She was, of all the\nmen and women one has known, the most vividly alive. Having renounced all that\nmost of us hold dearest, she had the right to be earnest and to demand\nearnestness; but not in the smallest degree did the overmastering purpose of\nher being remove her from the sphere of personal relations. At all times she\ntoiled with an absolute concentration; her inner life was intense, austere,\nand deeply controlled. Yet never was anyone more wholly and exquisitely human,\nmore lovely and spontaneous in the sharing of daily services and joys.\nProfessor Geddes has recalled the infinite changefulness of her moods. They\nran, in truth, over the whole scale: from the fierceness and scorn of which\nMr. Nevinson speaks to a sparkling playfulness that made her, in India as in\nthe West, the life and light of her circle. In matters of personal conduct, as\nin weightier affairs of public or social activity, she was an unequalled\ncounsellor: so extraordinary in its rapidity and sureness was her judgment.\nAnd those to whom she gave the ennobling gift of her friendship knew her as\nthe most perfect of comrades, while they hold the memory of that gift as this\nworld\'s highest benediction. They think of her years of sustained and intense\nendeavour, of her open-eyed and impassioned search for truth, of the courage\nthat never quailed, the\n\np. xxx\n\nnoble compassionate heart; they think of her tending the victims of famine and\nplague, or ministering day by day among the humble folk with whom her lot was\ncast: putting heart into the helpless and defeated, showing to the young and\nperplexed the star of a glowing faith and purpose, royally spending all the\npowers of a rich intelligence and an overflowing humanity for all who called\nupon her in their need. And some among them count it an honour beyond all\nprice that they were permitted to share, in however imperfect a measure, the\nmind and confidence of this radiant child of God.\n\nS. K.
