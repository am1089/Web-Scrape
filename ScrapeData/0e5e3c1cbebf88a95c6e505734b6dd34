D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 17\n\n\xc2\xa7 6\\. Doctrine of Transmigration and Works.--At this point we may note two new\nideas which henceforth dominated Indian thought--transmigration of the soul (\n_sa \xe1\xb9\x83s\xc4\x81ra,_ literally "wandering") and the influence of works _(karma)_. The\nVedic Hindu was passionately convinced of the joy of life, the Hindu of a\nlater generation no less impressed by its misery. This pessimism finds\nexpression in two ideas. The first is that the only life worth living is that\nvouchsafed to the few elect--union of the soul with the transcendent Brahma;\nall other existence, whatever it may seem, is wretched, an infinite number of\nsouls flitting in constant sorrow and blindness through every degree of\norganic embodiment. The second idea is that every instant of experience is the\nrigidly predetermined resultant of a previous act; a present pleasure is the\nrequital of a relatively good deed, a present sorrow the repayment of an ill\ndeed, in a previous life; and every act whatsoever, whether of deed, thought,\nor speech, is absolutely evil, as attaching the soul still further to the\nfetters of embodiment. Gloomy and impracticable as is this attitude, it is\nsimply a phase of extreme idealism.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Atma, Self or Spirit](brk10.htm)\n\n'
