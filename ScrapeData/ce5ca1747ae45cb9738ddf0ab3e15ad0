And the goblin on his\nshoulder said: "O king of kings, you are terribly obstinate about this\nimpossible task. So to amuse the weary journey I will tell a story. Listen."\n\n\n\nIn the Kalinga country was a city called Beautiful, where people lived as\nhappily as in heaven. There ruled a famous king named Pradyumna. And in a part\nof this city was a region set apart by the king, where many Brahmans lived.\nAmong them was a learned, wealthy, pious, hospitable Brahman named Sacrifice.\n\nIn his old age a single son was born to him and his worthy wife. The boy grew\nunder the fostering care of his father, and showed signs of excellence. He was\ncalled Devasoma by his father, and his parents were entirely devoted to him.\n\nIn his sixteenth year the boy attracted everyone by his learning and modesty.\nThen he suddenly fell ill of a fever and died. When his father and mother saw\nthat he was really dead, they embraced the body and wept aloud. But their love\nfor him would not permit them to burn the body.\n\nSo the old relatives gathered, and said to the father: "Brahman, life is\nimaginary like a city in the sky. Do you not know this, you who know things\nabove and things below? The kings who enjoyed themselves like gods upon the\nearth, they have gone one by one to cemeteries filled with processions of\nweeping ghosts. Their bodies were burned by the flesh-devouring fire and eaten\nby jackals. No one could prevent it in their case. How much less in the case\nof others? Therefore, as you are a wise man, tell us what you mean by\nembracing this dead body?"\n\nSo at last the relatives persuaded him to let his son go, and they put the\nbody in a litter and brought it to the cemetery with weeping and wailing.\n\nAt that time a hermit was fulfilling a hard vow, and was living in a hut in\nthe cemetery. He was very thin because of his age and his hard life. His veins\nstuck out like cords to bind him, as if afraid that he would break in pieces.\nHis hair was tawny like the lightning.\n\nThis hermit heard the wailing of the people, and turned to his pupil who\nbegged food for him. Now this pupil was proud and arrogant. And the hermit\nsaid: "My boy, what is this wailing we hear? Go outside and find out, then\nreturn and tell me why this unheard-of commotion is taking place."\n\nBut the pupil said: "I will not go. Go yourself. My hour for begging is\npassing by."\n\nThen the teacher said: "Fool! Glutton! What do you mean by your hour for\nbegging? Only one half of the first watch of the day is gone."\n\nThen the bad pupil became angry and said: "Decrepit old man! I am not your\npupil. And you are not my teacher. I am going away. Do your begging yourself."\nAnd he angrily threw down his staff and bowl before the old man, and got up,\nand went away.\n\nThen the hermit laughed. He left his hut and went to the place where the dead\nBrahman boy had been brought to  be burned. He saw how the people mourned over\nsuch youthful freshness dead, and felt his own age and weakness. So he made up\nhis mind to exchange his body for the other by magic.\n\nHe went aside and wept at the top of his voice. Then he danced with all the\nproper gestures.\n\nAfter that, full of the longing to enjoy the happiness of youth, he left his\nown withered body by magic and entered the body of the Brahman youth. So the\nBrahman youth came to life on the funeral pyre and stood up. And a cry of joy\narose from all the relatives: "See! The boy is alive! He is alive!"\n\nThen the magician in the body of the Brahman boy said to the relatives: "I\nwent to the other world, and Shiva gave me life and directed me to perform a\ngreat vow. So now I am going off to perform the vow. If I do not, my life will\nnot last. Do you then go home, and I will come later."\n\nSo he spoke to those gathered there, having made up his mind what to do, and\nsent them home full of joy and grief. He went himself and threw his old body\ninto a pit, and then went off, a young man.\n\n\n\nWhen the goblin had told this story, he said to King Triple-victory, who was\nwalking through the night: "O King,  when the magician entered another\nperson\'s body, why did he weep before doing it, or why did he dance? I have a\ngreat curiosity about this point."\n\nAnd the king was afraid of the curse, so he broke silence and said: "Listen,\ngoblin. He thought: I am leaving to-day this body with which I won magic\npowers, the body which my parents petted when I was a child.\' So first he wept\nfrom grief, and from love of his body which he found it hard to leave. Then he\nthought: With a new body I can learn more magic.\' So he danced from joy at\ngetting youth."\n\nWhen the goblin heard this answer, he returned quickly to the sissoo tree. And\nthe king pursued him, undismayed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Twenty-second Goblin: The Father and Son who married Daughter and\nMother. What relation were their children?](ttg23.htm)\n\n'
