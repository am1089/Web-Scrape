This system of\nthought and practice, though not without unique and distinctive features, was\nlargely an adoption from very early times. Thus the heretical school of the\nJains, which, like the Buddhistic school, holds to a monastic religion, but\nwhich was founded earlier than 500 B. C., the date of the Buddha, also\nconsidered yoga as the means of liberation of the soul. For the Jains, the\nliberated state of the soul is not one of pure, feelingless, non-conceptual,\nnon-intuitional self-illumination, but is a state of supreme happiness in\nwhich the liberated self possesses a full perfection of all kinds of\nknowledge: perceptual, logical, alogical, intuitional and trance cognition.\nThis liberation is attained, they believe, by the performance of yoga. Yoga\nwith them consists mainly of a high elevation of character and complete\ncessation from the doing of evil, like the yoga of Patanjali described in the\nlast lecture. They lay great emphasis\n\np. 86\n\non the principle of non-injury, but they also urge the necessity of the other\nvirtues demanded by the yoga of Patanjali. Here, then, we have a system of\nthought according to which high moral elevation, by the cessation from all\nevil-doing and the acquirement of all the positive virtues is supposed to\nreveal a knowledge of reality as it is, and ultimately to liberate us from the\nbondage of our deeds and bring us to a state of perfect happiness, perfect\nknowledge and perfect power. The Jains, like the yogins, also believe that\nwithout the control of the mind no one can proceed in the true path. All our\nacts become controlled when our minds become controlled. It is by attachment\nand antipathy that man loses his independence. It is thus necessary for the\nyogin that he should be free from both attachment and antipathy and become\nindependent in the real sense of the term. When a man learns to look upon all\nbeings with an equal eye, he can effect such freedom, in a manner impossible\neven by the practice of the strictest asceticism through millions of years. 1\n\nThe Buddha himself, as the legendary account of his life tells us, once went\nout with his friends for a ride on horseback through the fields outside his\ncapital. There he saw that, as the fields were being ploughed by the peasants,\nmany insects were being mutilated and killed with each drive of the plough;\nand he saw also the sufferings of the poor beasts that were employed in the\nfield. Extremely affected by these sufferings, he dismounted from his horse\nand sat on the grassy ground to reflect on the ultimate destiny\n\np. 87\n\nof all beings. He realized that sufferings, diseases, old age and death are\nevils to which we are all subject. At that moment he saw a monk who said that,\nbeing afraid of births and deaths, he had renounced the world for his eternal\nsalvation. The suggestion affected him very deeply. He therefore decided to\nrenounce the world and seek to discover the way to the extinction of all\nsorrows, sufferings, diseases, old age and death. After testing many ways\nfollowed by other people, the Buddha himself adopted the path of yoga for the\nattainment of the truth that he ultimately discovered. As he sat with fixed\ndetermination he was tempted in various ways by Mara, the Buddhist Satan, but\nall these temptations failed and the Buddha remained firm in his purpose. 2\n\nIn the teachings and instructions found in Pali works ascribed to the Buddha,\nit is said that we are bound, without and within, by the entanglements of\ndesire and that the only way of loosening these is by the practice of right\ndiscipline, concentration and wisdom. Right discipline or sila means the\ndesisting from the commission of all sinful deeds. This is the first\nprerequisite. Thereby one refrains from all actions prompted by bad desires.\nConcentration or samadhi is a more advanced effort. By it all the roots of the\nold vicious tendencies and desires are destroyed, and one is led to the more\nadvanced state of a saint. It leads directly to _prajna_ or true wisdom; and\nby this wisdom one achieves his final emancipation. Here also, as in the yoga\nof Patanjali, the individual must habituate himself to meditating on the\nfourfold virtues of universal\n\np. 88\n\nfriendship, universal compassion, happiness in the happiness of all, and\nindifference to any kind of preferment, whether of himself, his friend, his\nenemy or a neutral party. By thus rooting out all misery he will eventually\nbecome happy; he will avoid thoughts of death and live cheerfully, and will\nthen pass over to the idea that other beings would also fare similarly. He may\nin this way habituate himself to thinking that his friends, his enemies and\nall those with whom he is not connected might all become happy. He may fix\nhimself in this meditation to such an extent that he obliterates all\ndifferences between the happiness of himself and that of others. He remembers\nthat if he allows himself to be affected by anger he would weaken the self-\nrestraint which he has been carefully practising. If some one has done a vile\naction by inflicting an injury, that cannot be a reason why he should himself\ndo the same by being angry with others. If he were finding fault with others\nfor being angry, could he himself indulge in anger? A saint who has thus made\nhis sila or right discipline firm enters into a state of concentration which\nhas four stages of gradual advancement. In the fourth or the last stage both\nhappiness and misery vanish and all the roots of attachment and antipathies\nare destroyed. With the mastery of this stage of concentration there comes the\nfinal state of absolute extinction of the mind and of total cessation of all\nsorrows and sufferings--Nirvana. 3\n\nIt is easy to see that this system of yoga is very much akin to Patanjali\'s\nyoga; and it is not improbable that both Patanjali and Buddha but followed a\npractice\n\np. 89\n\nwhich had been in existence from much earlier times, so that neither of them\nmay be credited with its discovery. But there is one point in which there is\nat least a good deal of theoretical difference between Buddha\'s system and\nthat of Patanjali. The ultimate goal of all concentration and its highest\nperfection with the Buddha is absolute extinction, while with Patanjali it is\nliberation of the spirit as self-illumination. 4\n\nIt is indeed very difficult to describe satisfactorily the ultimate mystical\nstage of Buddhistic Nirvana. For in one sense it is absolutely contentless. It\nis the state of deliverance from all sorrow and from all happiness. Yet, as\nthe ultimate ideal of all our highest strivings and the goal of all our moral\nperfection and concentration, it was an ideal which was in the highest degree\nattractive to the Buddhists. Had it been conceived as pure and simple\nextinction or annihilation, it could not have had the attraction for the\nBuddhists that it did. In many passages it is actually described as blissful.\nIn other passages it is held to be like the extinction of a flame. Some\nEuropean scholars have considered the descriptions of Nirvana by the Buddhists\nto be incoherent or inconsistent. It is not surprising that European scholars,\nwho are temperamentally often very different from the Buddhists of India,\nshould fall into error in trying to comprehend the mystical state of Nirvana.\nWhether we read the teachings of the Upanishads or of the yoga of Patanjali,\nthe ultimate state representing the goal of all the spiritual quest and\nspiritual strivings of the sages is set forth as absolutely\n\np. 90\n\ncontentless and non-conceptual. It is the self no doubt, but this self is\nentirely different from the self with which we are familiar in all our\nordinary worldly concerns. It is the extinction of all our sorrows and\npleasures and all our worldly experiences as much as is Nirvana. It is a state\nof absolute dissolution of all world-process. Though a blissful state, there\nis no distinction here between the bliss and the enjoyer of the bliss. But\nstill it is just such a non-logical ultimate state that could stimulate the\nhighest strivings of the best men of India. To call it blissful is not to\nunderstand bliss in an ordinary way. For this mystical bliss is\nincomprehensible by the intellect. 5\n\nNirvana was conceived as a state similar to that just described. If it was\ncompared to the extinction of a flame, this was quite proper. For is it not a\nstate in which all worldly experiences entirely and absolutely cease to exist?\nYet it is blissful in the sense that it can stimulate our spiritual cravings\nand spiritual strivings to the highest degree. The Hindus thought that at this\nstate there is only the self-luminous self. The Buddhists, however, could not\nsay what exists at this state for they denied the existence of the self. But\nthe teaching of the Hindus is scarcely more comprehensible, except for the\nfact that at least from the grammatical and literary point of view we have in\n"the self-luminous self" a positive expression. But this self is as\nindescribable as is the state of Nirvana, except by the negative method of\n"not this," "not that." But still this state was rightfully called immortal\nand blissful because it was looked upon by the Buddhists as\n\np. 91\n\nthe end of all their sufferings, the goal of all their spiritual strivings,\nand the culmination of spiritual perfection. What is especially emphasized,\nfrom the negative point of view, is that it is absolutely non-logical in its\nnature. It has no describable essence. The mysticism of the Buddhist consists\nin a belief in this essenceless state of Nirvana 1 as the state of ultimate\nperfection and ultimate extinction, to be realized by the complete extinction\nof desires and the supra-intellectual wisdom of the yoga practice. 6\n\nSo, though, for academic and philosophical discussions, the essenceless state\nof the vacuity of Nirvana is absolutely different from the pure self of yoga\nliberation, yet from the point of view of mystical experience both are too\ndeep and unfathomable for ordinary comprehension. Both are transcendent,\nunworldly, and contentless in their nature; and the methods of their\nrealization are also largely similar. 7\n\nIn digressing, I shall now turn your attention to other forms of mysticism\ninviting a belief in non-logical methods of achieving one\'s highest goal of\npower, happiness, wisdom or emancipation, and shall speak of Indian\nasceticism. The Taittiriya Brahmana, which was composed probably as early as\n700 B. C. (if not even earlier) speaks of Brahmacharya in the sense of\nstudying the Vedas with due self-control. We find there the story of\nBharadvaja who practised Brahmacharya for one whole life which was as long as\nthree\n\np. 92\n\nlives. Indra approached him and, finding him decayed and old, said,\n"Bharadvaja, if I were to give you a fourth life, what would you do with it?"\nHe answered, "I would use it in practising Brahmacharya." The word _tapas_\netymologically means heat, and in the Atharva Veda (XVII. 1. 24) is actually\nused in the sense of the heat of the sun. But by an extension of meaning the\nword was used to denote also the exertion of mental energy for the performance\nof an action and for the endurance of privations of all kinds, of heat, cold,\nand the like. It was regarded as a great force which could achieve\nextraordinary results. Thus it is said in the Taittiriya Upanishad that the\nGreat Being performed _tapas_ and having done so created all the world. In Rig\nVeda (X. 167. 1) Indra is said to have gained Heaven by _tapas_. _Tapas_ was\nthus probably understood from very early times as some kind of austere\ndiscipline, the exact nature of which, however, was rather vague, changeable\nand undefined. 8\n\nIn Ashvaghosha\'s Buddhacharita, which was written probably during the first\ncentury of the Christian era, we find that the Buddha was told by an ascetic\nin the forest how different ascetics lived like birds, by picking up grains\nleft in the fields; others ate grass like animals; some lived with snakes;\nsome sat still, like ant-hills, with nests of birds in the tangles of their\nlong hair and snakes playing on their bodies; some lived in water, with\ntortoises eating parts of their bodies, thinking that misery itself is virtue\nand that the highest happiness in Heaven can be achieved by under-going\nsufferings of all kinds. Even in recent times Indian\n\np. 93\n\nascetics have inflicted on themselves various kinds of self-mortifications for\nthe merits that are supposed to be derived from them. Thus a Brahmin ascetic\nat Benares is known to have lived for thirty-five years on a flat board\nstudded with iron nails or spikes on which he sits and lies down at full\nlength and which he never leaves night or day. Another common form of self-\ntorture is to raise one or both arms above the head, and to hold them there\nuntil they become stiff and atrophied. Some ascetics are known to live with\nfour fires burning very near them on their four sides and with the sun shining\nover their heads. Others undertake prolonged fastings and take vows of silence\nfor years. 9\n\nWe read in the Puranas that self-mortification by itself was believed to\ngenerate a force. By virtue of the force, power or energy of these self-\nmortifications, an ascetic who performed them could exact from the god he\nworshipped, any boon that he wanted and the god could not refuse to grant him\nthe boon even though he knew that the effect of granting it would be seriously\nmischievous. In the Ramayana, the greatest epic of India, the story is told of\nRavana, the great demon who carried away Sita, the wife of Rama. Ravana had\nwon the boon from Prajapati that he could not be killed by gods or demons, and\nit was by virtue of this boon that he could conquer all the gods, though he\nwas ultimately killed by Rama, a man. A story is told of a demon who had a\nboon from the god Shiva that the person on whose head he would put his hands\nwould he reduced to ashes. When\n\np. 94\n\nthe boon was granted, the demon wanted to test its truth by putting his hands\non the head of the god Shiva himself. Shiva was very much afraid and started\nto fly away with the demon pursuing him in hot haste. But the god Shiva had no\npower of taking away the favor that he had granted, for it was earned by the\nforce of the _tapas_ of the demon. Vishnu, who came to rescue the god Shiva,\nplayed a trick upon the demon. The latter was asked to test the truth of the\nboon about which he was sceptical on his own head and thus he was reduced to\nashes. This _tapas_ is often described as a fire. Unless the boon is granted\nand the ascetic desists from his _tapas_ , it is believed that the fire of his\n_tapas_ might even burn the whole world as it were. The force of these stories\nis that there was a belief that self-mortification is itself a source of great\npower and that by it one could gain any desire, be it an immortal life in\nHeaven, the conquest of all the worlds, or any other fanciful desire--even the\nliberation from all bondage. We thus find that, just as in the Vedic school\nsacrifice was conceived as a power which could produce any beneficial results\nthat the sacrificer wanted, so in this Puranic school there was the belief\nthat _tapas_ as self-mortification could give an individual anything he\ncraved. It was a power by itself. These _tapas_ performances were apparently\ncarried out to please certain gods, just as oblations were offered to the\nVedic gods in sacrifices; yet the god with reference to whom the _tapas_ was\nperformed had no power to refuse the boon. The boons were exacted from the\ngods by the power of _tapas_ , whether or not the gods\n\np. 95\n\nwilled to grant them of their own free volition, just as the effects of\nsacrifice did not in any way depend on the good will of the gods to whom\nofferings were made at those sacrifices. 10\n\nWe know that _tapas_ as the power of endurance of physical privations and\ntroubles was an indispensable accessory of both the Buddhist yoga and\nPatanjali\'s yoga. The gradual abandonment of desires until their ultimate\nextinction could be effected, was essential both to yoga and to Buddhism. It\nis true that the Upanishads do not speak of the extinction of desires, but\nthey certainly praise self-control as an indispensable desideratum. There is\nindeed the law of karma which requires that every person reap the fruits of\nhis actions, whether good or bad, and that if the life of the present birth is\nnot sufficient for the experience of the sufferings or the joys which are put\nto his account in accordance with the measure of his vice or virtue, he will\nenjoy or suffer the fruits of his deeds in another birth. So, in an endless\nchain of births and rebirths, moves on the cyclic destiny of man. All his\nrebirths are due to the fact that he is filled with desires, and for their\nfulfillment he performs actions out of attachments, passions, antipathies,\netc. By the law of karma (which acts automatically according to some, and is\ncontrolled by the will of God according to others) he enjoys or suffers the\nfruits of his actions in this or in subsequent births. So if the successive\nchain of births is to be terminated, the accretion of the fruits of karma must\nbe stopped, and if the accretion of karma is to be stopped, desire must be\n\np. 96\n\nrooted out. I shall not enter into the subtle question as to whether the place\nof superior importance belongs to karma or to the extinction of desires in the\nHindu, Buddhist and Jaina schemes of life. Whichever of the two may be\nconsidered the more important in each particular Hindu or Buddhist system of\nthought, they are nevertheless indissolubly connected. For out of desires come\nthe actions and their fruits, and out of actions and the enjoyment or\nsuffering of their fruits of pleasures or sorrows come further desires, and so\non. However, if one looks at the matter psychologically, the extinction of\ndesires may be considered the more important, since it is for Indian\nphilosophy the indispensable ethical desideratum for all spiritual\nachievement. If the ultimate freedom of the spirit and the cessation of the\ncycle of births and rebirths be the ultimate ethical and spiritual goal, this\ncan only be attained by the extinction of desires and the termination of the\naccretion of the fruits of our deeds. The development of the ideal of _tapas_\nis a direct result of this ideal of the extinction of desires. It was probably\nthought in some circles that control of desires implies on its positive side\nthe idea of self-mortification. Logically it certainly does not. But the\nmistaken transition is easy. So there grew up a system of practice in which\npeople thought that self-mortifications are of the highest merit and are\ncapable of giving anything that might be desired. Soon degeneration set in.\nSelf-mortifications were probably introduced as supplementary to the control\nof desires. They then came to be practiced for the indulgence of desires for\n\np. 97\n\nattaining heaven or superior power, and thus began to perform functions\nsimilar to those that were ascribed to sacrifices in Vedic circles. 11\n\nThe Buddha himself, as the legendary account of Ashvaghosha\'s Buddhacharita\nrelates, directs the same criticisms as the above against the practice of\nself-mortification. He deplores the fact that, after leaving all worldly\ncomforts, relatives and friends, men should with all these self-mortifications\ncalled tapas, desire only the satisfaction of desires. People are afraid of\ndeath, but when they seek the satisfaction of desires this leads to births,\nand thus they again face death of which they are afraid. If self-mortification\nis by itself productive of virtue, then the enjoyment of pleasures must be\nvicious. But if it is believed that virtue produces pleasures or happiness,\nand if pleasures are vices, then virtue produces vice, which is self-\ncontradictory. It is strange, however, that the Buddha himself, when he wanted\nto attain to the highest wisdom or philosophy, undertook for six years the\nmost rigorous asceticism and with all his limbs emaciated was almost on the\npoint of death. He did not, of course, aim at the fruition of any ordinary\ndesires, but at the discovery of the wisdom by which birth and death and all\nthe sufferings associated with them could be stopped. All the same, he at\nfirst followed the custom then prevalent among ascetics and underwent the most\naustere discipline. But at the end of six years he realized that the\nperformance of asceticism was unnecessary and without value for the attainment\nof the higher wisdom. He then bethought himself as to\n\np. 98\n\nhow he might regain his former strength and physique.\n\nHe thought that by hunger, thirst and fatigue the mind loses its ease, and\nthat if the mind is not at ease one cannot by its use attain the highest\nwisdom. It is by the due satisfaction of the senses that the mind comes to its\nease, and it is the easy, peaceful, and healthy mind in a healthy body that\ncan attain the wisdom of yoga concentration. So the Buddha gave up his old\nforms of hard ascetic practice and tried to regain his health by proper food,\nbathing, etc. His associates, however, who probably knew only the old forms of\npractice, and were therefore shocked over his abandonment of them, left him.\nIt was only after he had thus recovered his health that he could resist all\nthe temptations of Mara, the Buddhistic Satan, and attain by concentration,\nhighest wisdom. The wisdom that the Buddha attained seems to have been more of\nthe nature of logical thought, but the goal that was to be attained by such\nwisdom was the mystical, inexpressible, essenceless Nirvana; and the direct\nmeans by which this could be attained was not logical thought or reasoning or\nscriptural or other kinds of learning, but the extinction of all desires (\n_trishna-kshaya_ ). 12\n\nThe principal virtues of universal friendship, universal compassion, etc., to\nwhich reference has already been made, were appreciated early in Buddhism and\nalso in the yoga of Patanjali. But it may well be argued that there was\nscarcely any place for the active manifestation of universal friendship or\nuniversal compassion in a scheme of life which was decidedly individualistic.\nNo one who sought the absolute freedom\n\np. 99\n\nof his own self, or the extinction of his whole personality like the\nextinguishing of a flame, and who sought the cessation of his own rebirths and\nsorrow as the only goal and the only ambition to be realized, could have much\nscope for any active manifestation of universal friendship. The altruistic\nideal can therefore at best be merely a disposition, and can manifest itself\nmerely in a negative way, e.g., in non-injury to any being. But a person who\nholds such an individualistic notion of salvation cannot, in his scheme of\nlife, have any leisure or opportunity for the doing of active good to others.\n13\n\nIn the Hindu Puranas or religio-mythological works, written in poetry, we\nsometimes come across tales of wonderful self-sacrifice for the good of the\ngods or even for the good of animals who sought protection. But tales of self-\nsacrifice from the motive of universal friendship are very rare, and they do\nnot seem to fit in with the Hindu ideal of personal and individual liberation.\nA story is told that when the gods were in great trouble in their war with\nVritra, a demon, they approached the sage Dadhichi. For it was decreed by fate\nthat the demon could be killed with a weapon made of Dadhichi\'s bones but with\nnothing else. Dadhichi, in response to the request of the gods, willingly gave\nup his life, in order that the gods, with a weapon made of his bones, might\ndestroy the demon. A story is also told of King Shibi, who was tested by the\ngods Indra and Agni. Agni took the form of a pigeon, and Indra that of a\npursuing hawk. The pigeon took shelter with King Shibi. The latter\n\np. 100\n\nwould not give it over to the hawk because the pigeon had taken shelter with\nhim and under these circumstances he would rather give up his own life than\nallow the pigeon to be killed. At last the hawk said that he would be\nsatisfied if King Shibi would give from his own body flesh of the same weight\nas that of the pigeon, and the king cut the flesh of his thigh with his own\nsword. This, however, is a case of the kshatriya\'s virtue of giving shelter to\nthose who seek it, even at the sacrifice of one\'s own life. It does not\nexemplify self-sacrifice for the good of beings in general, out of pure\nmotives of universal friendship. The tale is a Brahmanic adaptation of a\nBuddhist story called Shibijataka, in which King Shibi is said to have torn\nout his eyes and made a gift of them out of motives of pure charity alone. In\nanother story in the Mahabharata, Shibi is said to have cut up his own son as\nfood for a Brahmin who desired the son\'s flesh for dinner; and to please the\nBrahmin Shibi was prepared to join in eating the dinner consisting of his own\nson\'s flesh. The motive here was the supreme duty of pleasing the Brahmins and\ngiving them whatever they wanted. 14\n\nBut though the ideal of universal friendship and compassion does not seem to\nhave been an active creed among the Hindus or among the followers of the\nHinayana school of early Buddhism, it assumed a role of paramount importance\nin the Mahayana school of Buddhism. Here universal altruism and universal\ncompassion, and happiness and sorrow in the happiness and sorrow of others,\nform the dominant principle.\n\np. 101\n\n[paragraph continues] The philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhism was peculiarly\nidealistic. It taught that matter as such has no existence in any form, and\nthat all things perceived are but creations of the mind, and more like a magic\nshow than reality. Everything, according to it, is essenceless and\nindescribable, mere phantom creation of the mind. Indeed, mind itself is not\nultimately real in any sense, but is as illusory a creation as all other\nthings created by it. It is the realization of this that was called _bodhi_ or\nperfect knowledge. Those who perceive this truth attain perfect knowledge and,\nlike a flame extinguished, reach Nirvana or the final deliverance from all\nsorrows and rebirths. 15\n\nThere is a lower order of saints called _arhats_ , or _pratyekabuddhas_. These\n_pratyekabuddha_ saints are said to be of a lower order because they live\nalone by themselves like the rhinoceros. By their spiritual endeavors, they\nobtain a logical understanding of the way in which all worldly things\noriginate and pass away; and by meditation on the essencelessness of all\nthings, they attain perfect knowledge and Nirvana. They are not instructed by\nany one, nor do they teach others to attain the knowledge that they gain. They\nare accustomed from the beginning to lead a lonely life like the Hindu yogis,\nand the instruction of others does not interest them. They are therefore\nregarded as being only Buddhas or enlightened ones of a lower order.\n\nThe higher Buddhas are those who aim not only at the vision of truth for\ndestroying their inner notion of self or ego and all desires of existence and\nnon-existence,\n\np. 102\n\nbut also at doing good to all living beings and constantly practicing the\ngreat virtues. Their enlightenment includes not only the possession of the\ntruth indispensable to salvation, but also omniscience, universal knowledge of\nall details of things, and omnipotence. The perfect Buddha attains these\npowers not only through his prolonged meditations, by which he gets insight\ninto the principles of all things, but also through his infinite merits of\nconstantly performing the great virtues of charity, patience, etc. The man who\naims at the attainment of this superior Buddhahood is called a Bodhisattva\n(one who is on the way to the attainment of perfect knowledge). His superior\naim consists in this that, at the cost of personal sufferings, he wishes the\ntemporal happiness of others. He continually desires for others supreme and\ntemporal happiness, and for himself the Buddhahood as a means of realizing\nthis service to others. Even after the saint attains true enlightenment and\nknows that there is no essence in anything and that nothing exists, he\ncontinues to practice the virtues of charity, morality and patience, and to\nmature the qualities of his supreme enlightenment. 16\n\nWe sometimes hear very remarkable stories of Buddhist saints, even of actual\nhistorical saints, who showed supreme self-control and compassion for others.\nThus it is said of Aryadeva, a great Buddhist teacher of the second century,\nthat he once defeated in argument a teacher of non-Buddhistic doctrines. A\nyoung disciple of this defeated teacher, greatly enraged over his teacher\'s\ndefeat, determined to murder Aryadeva\n\np. 103\n\nand awaited a suitable opportunity. One day Aryadeva was preaching the\ndoctrine of the essencelessness of all things, and was refuting heretical\nviews before his pupils in a solitary forest. After this instruction, while he\nwas taking a walk alone, the enemy stabbed him from ambush, saying, "You\nconquered my teacher with your knowledge, but I now conquer you with my\nsword." Aryadeva, holding fast with his hands his stabbed belly, bade the\nwould-be assassin take his three clothes and bowl and escape over the\nmountains in monk\'s garb so that others might not capture and punish him. He\nfurther told him that he was very sorry for him because of the seeds of sinful\ndeeds that he was sowing. The murderer was deeply moved by the saint\'s\ncompassion and sympathy, and asked Aryadeva to teach him the doctrine. Even in\nhis wounded condition Aryadeva began to teach him the Buddhist doctrine of the\nessencelessness of all things. After giving him some instructions Aryadeva\nfell in a swoon and his assailant escaped. Soon afterwards Aryadeva\'s pupils\ncame and enquired about the murderer. To them the teacher replied that there\nwas no one who was killed or who killed, no friend and no enemy, no murderer,\nthat everything was a delusion due to ignorance. 17\n\nHe who is kind and good and has a great propensity for doing good to others,\nand who, though incapable of committing a sinful action for himself, may yet\nbe so moved by love for his fellow beings as to commit a wrong action for\nthem, is fit to take the vow of a Bodhisattva who would spend all his future\ncareer\n\np. 104\n\nfor the good of others. His enthusiasm is not for the egoistical calm of the\nsaint who is anxious for his own deliverance; he is moved by the most\naltruistic of all motives, viz., compassion for all creatures. It is such a\nperson who takes the vow of Bodhisattva or one who aspires to the goal of a\nfuture Buddha.\n\nBut even then it is one thing to take a vow and another thing to fulfil it.\nOrdinarily one\'s unconstrained love is given to himself and it is only by\nreflection that the Bodhisattva learns to care wholly for the welfare of\nothers. At the lower stages, his nature leaves him at the mercy of his\ninclination; his knowledge of truth is but slight, and the direct penetrating\nsight of the yoga meditations is entirely lacking to him. But by a continual\nrepetition of his high aspirations, and by a more and more studious practice\nof the good works which they involve, he gradually comes to the higher stages\nof progress. As he enters these, wishing to bear the burden of the sins of all\nhuman beings in the hells and elsewhere, he becomes free from all fears of\nevil reputation, rebirth, death, etc. Becoming more and more perfect, he\ngradually masters the virtues of faith, compassion, affection for all,\ndisinterestedness, reverence for self and for others. All his actions are for\nthe good of others, and his only thought is that he may be serviceable to all\nbeings. 18\n\nThe person who intends to enter upon the higher career of a Bodhisattva and\nultimately to become the perfect Buddha, places himself under the guidance of\na religious preceptor, performs the moral or pious works, and undertakes the\nvow of _bodhi_. He thinks\n\np. 105\n\nthat it is only by a desire to become a perfect Buddha for the salvation of\nmen, and by dedicating himself to the good of all beings, that the sins of his\npast lives can he wholly removed. He confesses his own guilt and imperfections\nand deplores them. He wishes to dedicate all the fruits of his virtuous deeds,\nmerit and piety to the good of all creatures and for the attainment of their\nBodhi. He wishes to be the bread for those who are hungry, and the drink for\nthose who are thirsty. He devotes himself by his love to all beings; and in\nhis compassion for their sufferings, he gives all that he is, to all\ncreatures. It is by such determinations that he produces in himself the proper\nstate of mind with which one may start in the high career of a Bodhisattva. He\nhas then to keep a strict vigilance over his thoughts and over the resolutions\nthat he has taken, and keep a continued watchfulness over mind and body. He\nmust also perform the great virtues called _paramitas_ , for thinking, though\ngood in itself, is not enough by itself; it must be continually supplemented\nby the exercise of the great virtues. He should restrain himself from all evil\nby continued watchfulness over his mind and body, and by self-control attained\nin this way. But he must also continually perform the great virtues in order\nto strengthen his life in progressive good.\n\nOne of the most important of these virtues is that of giving due scope to\ncompassion ( _karuna_ ). The aspirant thinks that his neighbor suffers pain as\nhe suffers his. Why should he be anxious about himself and not about his\nneighbor? Such a man may even\n\np. 106\n\ncommit a sin if he knows that this will be beneficial to one of his fellow-\nbeings. For the sake of doing good to others he should always be prepared to\nabandon even his meditations or even his chastity. It is through this\nuniversal compassion that he can reconcile all beings to himself--by\nalmsgiving, amiability, obligingness, and sharing the joy and sorrow of\nothers. But he ought also to take care that his tendency to charity do not\nbecome so excessive as to stand in the way of his spiritual advancement. For\nit is only on a high stage of spirituality that he can make himself most\ngenuinely serviceable to others. To give even one\'s flesh and blood for the\ngood of others is good, but the giving of spiritual food is certainly better.\nIt is not good to sacrifice one\'s body to satisfy the appetite of a tiger when\nthat body in a sound condition can be utilized for giving spiritual\ninstruction to others. 19\n\nCareful adherence to morality, consisting of purity of intention, reformation\nafter transgression, and regard for the law of right conduct, is another of\nthe important conditions which a Bodhisattva should strictly meet. Without\ngoing into any details, the main principle of morality consists in abstaining\nfrom all actions hurtful to others, or the maxim, "Do not do to others what\nyou would not like others to do unto you." But apart from this negative virtue\nof abstention, he should also acquire the positive virtues of devotion to\nstudy, reflection and meditation, reverence to the teacher, nursing the sick,\nconfession of guilt, association with people in their good and useful\nundertakings and in their difficulties and sicknesses, giving them\n\np. 107\n\nright teaching, etc.,--in short, doing good to all people in all possible\nways.\n\nAnother important virtue is patience or control of anger, for anger is the\ngreatest of all sins. He should also practice the virtue of energetically\nconquering all incapacity of body and mind, all attachment to pleasures and\nwant of firm determination. This he can do by thinking of the evil effects of\nthese traits and by recalling that, unless he can firmly keep himself to the\nstrict path of virtue, he will never be able to cross the ocean of suffering,\nand that, however low may be his present state, he may by continued exertion\nraise himself to the highest stage of perfection of the Buddhas. He should\nalso derive additional strength by thinking: first, of his great desire to rid\nhimself and all other beings from all their sins: second, of his great pride\nover undertaking to bear the burdens of all creatures; third, of his joy in\nundertaking new tasks as soon as the old ones are finished--his happiness is\nin action itself, and he seeks in action no other fruit than the pleasure of\nthe action done; fourth, of his self-mastery of attention, and of keeping his\nmind and body always completely alert. If he for any reason fails once, he\nmust discover the cause and see that he may not fail again. 20\n\nTwo further virtues are contemplation or concentration and the true wisdom\nwhich realizes the nothingness of all things. It is surprising how a\nmetaphysics of extreme idealism, of the nothingness and essencelessness of all\nthings, or of nihilism, could set for the achievement of the highest spiritual\nperfection a program\n\np. 108\n\nof life and endeavor which is altruistic in the most extreme degree\nimaginable. What is required is a state of perfection in which the individual\nesteems the ultimate state of mystical deliverance--Nirvana or extinction--to\nbe of little consequence, and is prepared to undergo all troubles, and refuse\nto enter Nirvana, unless and until all beings become good and happy and come\nto the path of deliverance. Out of the doctrines of self-control and the ideal\nof the extinction of desires, there has thus come a scheme of life in which\ndesirelessness is attained by magnifying the scope of desires from the\nindividual to the universal, by rejecting personal good for the sake of the\ngood of others. This good is not sought with a view to any selfish aims, for\nthe seer knows that nothing exists and that all forms and names are empty and\nessenceless. But he takes it upon himself to do this because of his supreme\ncompassion and of his determination to devote himself to the service of his\nfellow-beings and to bring to them the light of perfection. The milk of human\nkindness flows through him, and it is this flow of kindness in him which leads\nhim to his highest perfection. With him, as Shantideva (a great authority)\nsays, even contemplation occupies only a lower place. For he attains to his\nhighest only by persisting in the path of compassion.\n\nThe two cardinal features of his conduct are a firm conviction of the equality\nof his self with that of his neighbor and the substitution of his neighbor\'s\nself for his self. Each of these features involves a clear insight into the\nnature of things. If with great strength\n\np. 109\n\none can duly exemplify them, he attains all the merits of a Bodhisattva. He\nunderstands that our only enemy is our selfish "ego." Thus, he speaks to his\nown self, "Renounce, O my thought, the foolish hope that I have still a\nspecial interest in you. I have given you to my neighbor, thinking nothing of\nyour sufferings. For if I were so foolish as not to give you over to the\ncreatures, there is no doubt that you would deliver me to the demons, the\nguardians of hell. How often, indeed, have you not handed me over to those\nwretches, and for what long tortures! I remember your long enmity, and I crush\nyou, O self, the slave of your own interests. If I really love myself, I must\nnot love myself. If I wish to preserve myself, I must not preserve myself." 2\n21\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[91:1](hm06.htm#fr_4) There are some Buddhist thinkers, the Sthiramati, who\nhold that the state of Nirvana is a state of subject-objectless, pure,\nunchangeable consciousness called atayvignana.\n\n[109:2](hm06.htm#fr_5) L. de la Vallee Poussin\'s article "Bodhisattva,"\n_Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics_ (edited by James Hastings), Vol. II, p.\n753.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Lecture V.
