With the fire-wood (idhma, lighting material) the Adhvaryu lights\n(indh) the fire: hence it is called fire-wood. And with the kindling verses\n(samidheni) the Hot _ri_ kindles (sam-indh, to make blaze): hence they are\ncalled kindling verses.\n\n1:3:5:22\\. He (the Adhvaryu 1) says (to the Hot _ri_ ): \'Recite to the fire as\nit is being kindled!\' for it is to the fire, when it is being kindled, that he\nrecites.\n\n1:3:5:33\\. Here now some people say, \'O Hotar, recite to the fire as it is\nbeing kindled!\' But let him not say so; for that (priest) is not a Hot _ri_ as\nyet; only when he (the sacrificer) elects him 2, does he\n\np. 96\n\nbecome a Hot _ri_. Let him therefore say, \'Recite to the fire as it is being\nkindled!\'\n\n1:3:5:44\\. He recites (verses) addressed to Agni: he accordingly kindles it\n(the fire) with the aid of its own deity. In the gayatri metre (are the verses\nwhich) he recites; for the gayatri is Agni\'s metre: by means of its own metre\nhe thereby kindles it. The gayatri is vigour, the gayatri is the brahman 1\n(the priestly order): with vigour he thereby kindles it.\n\n1:3:5:55\\. Eleven (verses) he recites; for of eleven syllables consists the\ntrish _t_ ubh metre. The gayatri is the brahman and the trish _t_ ubh is the\nkshatra (or military order) 2. With the aid of these two energies he thus\nkindles it: for this reason he recites eleven (verses).\n\n1:3:5:66\\. Thrice he recites the first verse, and thrice the last one; for of\nthreefold beginning are sacrifices, and of threefold termination: therefore he\nrecites thrice the first and the last (verses).\n\n1:3:5:77\\. Fifteen samidheni verses result (from this repetition of the first\nand last of the eleven verses). The fifteen-versed chant 3, doubtless, is the\nthunderbolt,\n\np. 97\n\nand the thunderbolt means strength; so that he thereby converts the samidhenis\ninto strength: hence, if he should hate any one, he may crush him with his\ngreat toes 1 at the time when those (verses) are recited. By saying, \'I here\ncrush so and so!\' he crushes him with that thunderbolt.\n\n1:3:5:88\\. Fifteen nights indeed there are in a half-moon; and growing by\nhalf-moons the year passes: hence he thereby obtains the nights.\n\n1:3:5:99\\. Now in the fifteen gayatri verses there are indeed three hundred\nand sixty syllables 2; and three hundred and sixty days there are in a year:\nhence he thereby obtains the days, he thereby obtains the year.\n\n1:3:5:1010\\. For an ish _t_ i (which is performed in order to obtain the\nfulfilment of a special wish) 3 let him recite seventeen samidheni verses; for\nin a low voice he sacrifices to the deity to which he offers an ish _t_ i.\n\np. 98\n\n[paragraph continues] Twelve months, namely, there are in a year, and five\nseasons 1: this (makes) the seventeenfold Pra _g_ apati. For verily Pra _g_\napati is all: hence for what wish he performs the ish _t_ i, that wish he thus\naccomplishes by means of the All. In a low voice he sacrifices to the deity;\nfor what is spoken in a low voice is undefined (indistinct), and undefined is\nthe \'All:\' hence for whatever wish he performs the ish _t_ i, that wish he\nthus accomplishes by means of the All. This is the practice in regard to an\nish _t_ i.\n\n1:3:5:1111\\. Some people say: \'Let him recite twenty-one samidheni verses also\nat the full- and new-moon sacrifice.\' Twelve, doubtless, are the months of the\nyear, five the seasons, and three these worlds: this (makes) twenty; and the\ntwenty-first is this very (sun) that here shines: he is the resort, he the\nstay; thereby he (the sacrificer) obtains this resort, this stay. He may\ntherefore recite twenty-one.\n\n1:3:5:1212\\. Let him recite them only for one of established prosperity (gata\n_s_ ri), who would not wish to become either better or worse. For, what he for\nwhom they recite is like, like that he will either be or worse 2, for whom,\nthat knows this, they recite\n\np. 99\n\nthose (twenty-one verses). This, however, is mere speculation, for those\n(twenty-one verses) are not recited 1.\n\n1:3:5:1313\\. Thrice he should recite the first and thrice the last (verse),\nwithout drawing breath; for three are these worlds, so that he thereby spreads\n(san-tan) these worlds, gains these worlds. Also three breaths there are in\nman: this recitation thereby causes him (the sacrificer) to be extended\n(santata), not cut short (by death).\n\n1:3:5:1414\\. He (the Hot _ri_ ) should endeavour to recite this\n(uninterruptedly) as long as his strength lasts. If, on the other hand, he\nwere to take breath in the middle (of the verse), it would be a slight on this\nvery (sacrifice) 2: by reciting this (holy) composition\n\np. 100\n\nwithout taking breath, that slight will be avoided.\n\n1:3:5:1515\\. If, however, he do not care to undertake this, he may also recite\none (verse) at a time without drawing breath: he thereby spreads those worlds\none by one, gains those worlds one by one. The reason why he takes breath, is\nthat the gayatri is indeed breath; and that by reciting a complete gayatri\nverse, he accordingly bestows complete breathing (on the sacrificer): let him\ntherefore recite one (verse) at a time without breathing.\n\n1:3:5:1616\\. He recites them in a continuous, uninterrupted way: thereby he\nmakes the days and nights of the year continuous, and in a continuous,\nuninterrupted way revolve those days and nights of the year. And in this way\nhe gives no access to the spiteful enemy; but access he would indeed give, if\nhe were to recite them discontinuously: he therefore recites in a continuous,\nuninterrupted way.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[95:1](sbe1216.htm#fr_264) The Adhvaryu, in the first place, prepares a seat\nfor the Hot _ri_ , either west of the altar or north of its left hip; and\ncovers it with dry Ku _s_ a grass. [He then calls, \'O Hot _ri_ , come!\'] The\nHot _ri_ ; having rinsed his mouth north-east of the \xc3\x82havaniya, with his face\nto the east, turns round from left to right and betakes himself to the\nsacrificial ground, always keeping his right foot before the left. He finally\ntakes up his position so as to have the heel of the right foot in a line with\nthe north hip of the altar, and the toes on the barhis; whilst he keeps the\nhands on a level with the heart, spread open and joined together, and looks\ntowards the junction of the earth and sky. The Adhvaryu then takes a samidh\n(kindling-stick) and calls on him as above. The Hot _ri_ now mutters the\nformulas \'Adoration to the teacher! Adoration to the observer! Adoration to\nthe promulgator!\' &c. (\xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ rautas I, 2, 1). The sacrificer then takes\nthe wooden sword and says, \'Recite for me, as it were, stretching along (i.e.\ncontinuously)!\' whereupon the Hot _ri_ ; having asked and received the\npermission of the Brahman, proceeds to recite the kindling verses. Katy. III,\n1, 1 seq.; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. I, 1, 4 seq.\n\n[95:2](sbe1216.htm#fr_265) This does not take place until the pravara or\ninvitation addressed to Agni, the Hot _ri_ of the gods, to assist in calling\nthe p. 96 gods to the sacrifice, cf. Saya _n_ a and _S_ at. Br. I, 5, 1, 1\nseq. According to some authorities, however, the choosing of the Hot _ri_\nseems to take place at this particular time, or even before, at the time of\nthe agnyanvadhana; cf. Hillebrandt, p. 73.\n\n[96:1](sbe1216.htm#fr_266) The gayatri (though it is not the most frequent\nmetre) is considered as the first, as it is the shortest, of Vedic metres. The\nhymns addressed to Agni are mostly in the gayatri metre.\n\n[96:2](sbe1216.htm#fr_267) The hymns celebrating the heroic deeds of Indra and\nhis associates, the wind-gods, are almost entirely composed in the trish _t_\nubh, the most frequent of Vedic metres.\n\n[96:3](sbe1216.htm#fr_268) The pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a-stoma, or form of\nrecitation in fifteen verses at the Soma-sacrifice, is sacred to Indra\n(Nirukta 7, 10), the wielder of the thunderbolt.\n\n[97:1](sbe1216.htm#fr_269) Or, with his thumbs (a\xe1\xb9\x85gush _th_ abhyam). The Ka\n_n_ va text has \'padyabhyam a\xe1\xb9\x85gush _th_ abhyam;\' but Katy. III, 1, 7 has\n\'a\xe1\xb9\x85gush _th_ abhya _m_ padyabhya _m_ va,\' which would seem to leave a choice\nbetween the thumbs and the great toes; the commentator, however, takes va in a\nrestrictive sense. The sacrificer is to press down the earth with his great\ntoes (or thumbs) each time when a kindling verse is recited.\n\n[97:2](sbe1216.htm#fr_270) The gayatri verse consists of three times eight\nsyllables, and 24 \xc3\x97 15 = 360. In the place of the last samidheni (called\nparidhaniya), however, the Vasish _th_ as have a trish _t_ ubh stanza (4 \xc3\x97 11\nsyllables), so that the above computation of syllables does not hold good in\ntheir case. One might be inclined to infer from this that the trish _t_ ubh\nwas the more original, a gayatri being substituted later to yield the above\nsymbolical number of syllables. Cf. Taitt. S. II, 5, 7 seq.; Taitt. Br. III,\n5, 3.\n\n[97:3](sbe1216.htm#fr_271) The kamyesh _t_ is, and ish _t_ is generally, are\nperformed with certain modifications, on the model of the new- and full-moon\nsacrifice, of which they are therefore said to be vik _ri_ tis or\nmodifications.\n\n[98:1](sbe1216.htm#fr_272) In other passages, and in later times generally,\nsix seasons, comprising two months each, are counted, but the transitional\nseason between winter and spring, _s_ i _s_ ira, is not unfrequently, as in\nour passage, combined with the winter season (hemanta), or partially with that\nand the spring (vasanta). On the identification of Pra _g_ apati with the\nyear, cf. note on I, 2, 5, 12.\n\n[98:2](sbe1216.htm#fr_273) The condition of one who is gata _s_ ri cannot be\nimproved, but only impaired. The construction of this paragraph is somewhat\ndoubtful to me. It runs thus: Ta haita gata _s_ rer evanubruyad ya i _k_ _kh_\nen na _s_ reyant syam na papiyan iti yad _ri_ _s_ aya haiva sate \'nvahus tad\n_ri_ n va haiva bhavati papiyan va yasyaiva _m_ vidusha eta p. 99 anvahu _h_\nso esha mima _m_ saiva na tv evaita anu _k_ yante. Saya _n_ a seems to take it\nthus:--\'He should recite them only for a gata _s_ ri. A householder who\ndesires neither an improvement nor a lowering of his position, is just such a\none for whom the Hot _ri_ s recite the samidhenis in the appointed (niyatena)\nway. Further, for whomsoever, that thus knows the irregular (? aniyata, not\nregulated) way of recitation, they recite those twenty-one samidhenis, he\nbecomes either worse or better. What is set forth in the words from "A\nhouseholder who desires neither an improvement" &c. is mere speculation; the\nrecitation is not to be performed in this way.\' The corresponding paragraph of\nthe Ka _n_ va recension is much briefer and clearer:--Tad etad gata _s_ rir\neva kurvita na ha _s_ reyan na papiyan bhavati yasyaivam anvahu _h_ saisha\nmima _m_ saiva na tv anu _k_ yante, \'only a gata _s_ ri, however, should do\nthis; for neither better nor worse becomes he for whom they recite thus. This\nis indeed speculation, but they (the twenty-one samidhenis) are not recited.\'\n\n[99:1](sbe1216.htm#fr_274) In the Taitt. S. II, 5, 10, the number of verses\n(effected by the repetition) is given as varying, according to the special\nobject in view, between fifteen and forty-eight.\n\n[99:2](sbe1216.htm#fr_275) ? Or, it would be an act of neglect on his, the\nsacrificer\'s, part: by (the Hot _ri_ ) reciting without fetching breath, that\nact, that neglect would be avoided.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 1.
