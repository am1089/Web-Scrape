Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! Of what sort is the Dharma, i.e., the\nworship of the Devi? In what way shall we worship Her, so that She gives us\nthe Highest Place? What are the methods and forms of Her Worship? Where and\nwhen shall we worship Her! So that the Durga Devi saves us from the above\nmentioned hells.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n3-20. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Devar _s_ i! You are the foremost of the Knowers\nof Truth. I will therefore tell you how the Devi gets pleased and how Her\nworship is conducted according to the Dharma. Hear attentively. O Narada! I\nwill also describe the nature of Sva Dharma. Hear that also. When one\nworships, with due rites and ceremonies, the Devi in this beginningless world,\nShe Herself removes all the terrible dangers and difficulties. Hear the rules\nhow the people worship the Devi. When the Pratipat Tithi (the first day after\nthe Full or New Moon) comes, one should worship the Devi with a present of\nrice, etc., with ghee (clarified butter) and give that to the Brahmi _n_ s.\nThen one becomes completely free from any disease. On the second day (Dvitiya\nTithi), one must serve the Mother of the Universe with sugar and give that to\nthe Brahmins; he then becomes long-lived. On the third (tithi) on commencing\nwith the Pooja, the worshipper must give milk to the\n\n\n\np. 793\n\n\n\nDevi and give that to a best Brahmi _n_ ; he is then freed from all his\ntroubles and ailings. On the fourth (tithi) the worshipper is to offer a cake\nof flour to the Devi and then give that to a Brahmi _n_ ; no obstacles come to\nthat man. On the fifth tithi, the worshipper is to offer plantains to the Devi\nand then to give that to the Brahmi _n_ s; he thus becomes intelligent. On the\nsixth tithi, the worshipper gives honey to the Devi and then that to a Brahmi\n_n_ ; he gets thus the beauty of his body. On the seventh tithi, the Brahmi\n_n_ gives to the Devi the Naivedya (an offering of rice, etc.) with Gu _r_\n(sugarcandy) and then that to the Brahmi _n_ s; he then becomes freed from his\nmental sorrows. On the eighth day, if one gives cocoanut, one is freed of\none\xc2\x92s remorse, etc.; on the ninth, if anybody gives fried rice (Laj), he will\nhave his happiness increased both in this world and in the next. O Muni! If on\nthe tenth tithi, one offers to the Devi black Til (sesamum) and then to the\nBrahmi _n_ , he becomes free from the fear of death. If, on the eleventh\ntithi, (ekadas\xc2\x92i) one gives the curd to the Devi and then to the Brahmi _n_ ,\none becomes a great favourite of the Devi. If on the twelfth day, one offers\nto the Devi and to the Brahmi _n_ the Chipi _t_ aka rice or grain (well\nparched and flattened) one becomes a favourite of the Devi. If, on the\nthirteenth day one gives to the Bhagavati grains and then that to a Brahmi _n_\n, one gets progeny. If, on the fourteenth day, one gives to the Devi the flour\nof fried barley or other grains (S\xc2\x92aktu) and then that to a Brahmi _n_ , one\nbecomes a favourite of S\xc2\x92iva. If on the Full Moon day, one offers to the Devi\nPayasa and then that to a Brahmi _n_ , then one\xc2\x92s Pitris are uplifted to the\nhigher regions.\n\n\n\n21-42. O Muni! On the above tithis, if one forms daily Homas, as stated in the\nPuja Chapter, the Devi becomes very pleased. The articles corresponding to the\ntithi as mentioned above destroy all the evils and inauspicious omens.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, it is a rule to give an offering of Payasam (a food prepared of\nrice, milk, and sugar). On Monday, the milk; on Tuesday, the nice plantains;\non Wednesday, the fresh butter; on Thursday, the gu _d_ or sugarcandy, Friday,\nthe white sugar, and on Saturday, it is a rule to give the clarified butter of\ncow\xc2\x92s milk. Now hear what should be offered on the Nak _s_ attras. The\nfollowing are the Naivedyas given to each of the Nak _s_ attras, in due order,\nfrom As\xc2\x92vini :-- Clarified butter (ghee), sesamum (Til), sugar, curd, milk,\nKila _t_ ak (Malai, milk), Dadhikurchi (Malai Curd), Modaka (a kind of\nsweetmeat, a confection) Phe _n_ ika, Ghrita Ma _nd_ aka, a sort of sweet meat\nof wheaten flour and gur, Va _t_ apattra, Ghritapura (Ghior), Va _t_ aka,\nKharjura juice (of the datepalm), a sort of sweet meat of Gur and gram, honey,\nS\xc2\x92ura _n_ a, Gur\n\n\n\np. 794\n\n\n\nPrithuka, grapes, datepalms, Charakas, Apupa, Navanita (fresh butter), mudga,\nmodaka, and Matulinga. Now hear what are given in the Vi _s_ kambha and the\nother Yogas. The World Mother becomes very much pleased when one offers to Her\nthe following things :-- Gur, honey, ghee, milk, curd, Takra, apupa, fresh\nbutter, Karka _t_ i, Ku _s_ ma _nd_ a, Modaka, Panasa, plantain, Jambu (rose-\napple), mangoe, sesamum, oranges, Da _d_ ima, (pomegranate) Vadari (Jujube)\nthe Dhatri (\xc3\x82malaki) fruit, Payasa, Prithuka, gram, cocoanut, Jambira. Kaseru,\nand S\xc2\x92ura _n_ a. The auspicious events occur when these are offered. The\nintelligent persons have thus decided to give the above on Vi _s_ kambha and\nthe other Yogas. Now hear :-- I will describe the things that are offered on\nthe respective Kara _n_ as :-- Kamsara, Ma _nd_ aka, Pheni, Modaka, Va _t_\napattraka, Ladduka, Ghritapura, Til (Sesamun), curd, ghee, and honey. These\nare to be offered devotedly to the Devi on the respective Kara _n_ as. Now I\nwill describe to you the other offerings very pleasing to the Devi. Hear. O\nNarada! Hear it with great attention and love. On the third tithi of the\nbright fortnight, in the month of Chaitra, one is to worship duly the Madhuka\ntree and offer Pa\xc3\xb1cha Khadya (the five sorts of food). So hear what articles\nare to be offered according to the rules that are laid down on the third day\nof the white fortnight of the other months. The Gur, in the month of Vais\xc2\x92akh;\nthe honey, in Jyai _st_ ha; the fresh butter, in \xc3\x82 _s_ adha; the curd, in\nS\xc2\x92rava _n_ a; the S\xc2\x92arkara, in Bhadra; the Payas\xc2\x92a, in \xc3\x82s'vin; the pure milk,\nin Kartik; the Pheni, in Agrahaya _n_ a; the Dadhi Kurchika in Pau _s_ a; the\nclarified butter of cow\xc2\x92s milk, in Magha, and the cocoanut offerings, in the\nmonth of Phalguna. Thus with these twelve sorts of offerings, one is to\nworship the Devi in the twelve months respectively.\n\n\n\n43-69. One should worship the Devi in the Madhuka tree with these names :--\nMangala, Vai _sn_ avi, Maya, Kala-ratri, Duratyaya, Mahamaya, Matangi, Kali,\nKamalavasini, S'iva, Sahasrachara _n_ a, and Sarva mangalarupi _n_ i (One name\nfor each of the 12 months). Finally, to bring the vow to a good issue and to\nhave one\xc2\x92s desires fulfilled with greater success, one is to sing stotras\n(hymns) to the Mahes'vari, the Controller of all the gods, in that Madhuka\ntree, thus :-- Thou art lotus-eyed; obeisance to Thee! Thou art Jagaddhatri,\nthe Upholdress of the Universe, I bow down to Thee; Thou art Mahes\xc2\x92vari, Maha\nDevi, and Mahamangalarupi _n_ i (Thou art the great Devi, and Thou dost great\ngood to all). Thou destroyest the sins, Thou givest Mok _s_ a or final\nliberation. Thou art Parames\xc2\x92vari, Thou art the World Mother and Thou art of\nthe nature of the Highest Brahma. Thou art Madadatri (the giver of Mada, the\nSupreme Felicity and rapture or excessive\n\n\n\np. 795\n\n\n\ndelight), Thou art maddened with Mada the (Excessive Joy); Thou canst be\nreached when Thou art given proper veneration; Thou art the the Most High.\nThou art Intelligent; Thou art meditated upon by the Munis; and Thou dwellest\nin the Sun. Thou art the Lord of the several Lokas (worlds); Thou art endowed\nwith the Highest Knowledge; and Thou art of the colour of water at the time of\nPralaya (the Universal Dissolution). Thou art worshipped by the Gods and the\nAsuras for the destruction of the Great Moha. So Great Victory to Thee! Thou\nart the Rescuer of one from the abode of Death; Thou art worshipped by Yama,\nThou art the elder of Yama, Thou art the Controller of Yama and Thou art\nworshipped by all. Obeisance to Thee! Thou art impartial; Thou controllest\nall; Thou art perfectly unattached; Thou destroyest the people\xc2\x92s worldly\nattachments; Thou art The One to whom all look for the fructification of their\ndesires; and Thou art the Compassion Incarnate. Thou art, worshipped by the\nnames :-- Ka _n_ kala Krura, Kamak _s_ i; Minak _s_ i Marma bhedini,\nMadhuryarupas\xc2\x92alini; and Thou art worshipped with the Pra _n_ ava Om prefixed\nto all the Stotras and the Mantras. Thou art of the nature of the Seed Maya\n(mayavija); Thou canst be realised by repeating the mantra and Thou canst be\npleased by the deep concentration (Nididyasana) on Thee. Thou canst be reached\nby all men through their minds and Thou dost things that are pleasing to the\nMaha Deva. Thou dwellest in the trees As\xc2\x92vattha, Va _t_ a (Peepul tree), Neem,\nMangoe, Kapittha (wood apple tree), and the tree Kul (Jujube) trees. Thou art\nthe Palms (Jack) tree, Thou art Arka, Karira and K _s_ ira trees. Thou\nresidest in Dugdha valli (the milky juice of plants); Thou art the Compassion\nIncarnate; and fit to shew mercy. Thou art sincerity and kindness and Thou art\nthe Consort of the Omniscient. So Victory to Thee! O Narada! After the\nworship, if one performs the stotra above described, to the Devi, the\nworshipper derives all sorts of Pu _n_ yams (merits). He who reads daily the\nStotra, pleasing to the Devi, becomes freed of all sorts of diseases, pain and\nfreed of his fear of passions, so hard to conquer! What more than this that he\nwho wants money, gets money; who wants Dharma, gets Dharma; he who wants Kama,\ngets his Kama (objects of desires); and he who wants Mok _s_ a, gets Mok _s_\na. The Devi is the Awarder of the Chatur Varga fourfold fruits.\n\n\n\nIf this Stotra be read, the Brahmi _n_ becomes Vedavit, the knower of the\nVedas; the K _s_ attriya gets the victory; the Vais\xc2\x92ya gets wealth and the\nS\xc2\x92udra gets happiness. If this Stotra be read with devotion and attention, the\nPitris get undying satisfaction, lasting till Pralaya (the time of universal\ndissolution). Thus I have described to you the method of\n\n\n\np. 796\n\n\n\nworshipping the Devi. The Devas consider it with great attention. He gets the\nDevi Loka, who performs the worship of the Devi, as above described, with\ndevotion. O Brahma _n_ a! When the Devi is thus worshipped, all the desires\nare fulfilled; all sins are destroyed; and, in the end, one\xc2\x92s mind becomes\npure and the worshipper is respected and worshipped everywhere. O Son of\nBrahma! His fear of going into hell is destroyed by the Grace of the Devi;\neven in dreams, he does not fear anything. By the Grace of Maha Maya, his sons\nand his grandsons, riches and grains multiply and multiply. He becomes a great\nand steadfast devotee of the Devi; there is no doubt in this. Now I have\ndescribed to you completely the rules of worship of the Devi. When one\nperforms this, one becomes freed of the Narakas; and all sorts of good things\ncome to him. O Muni! The Madhuka worship and the monthly worship have been\ndescribed also. He who performs this Madhuka worship fully, never meets with\nany disease or obstacles. Now I will describe to you the other five aspects of\nthe Great Devi of the nature of Prakriti. Her Name, Form and Origin give\npleasure to all the worlds. O Muni! Now hear this Prakriti Pa\xc3\xb1chaka, its\nnarrative and the greatness thereof. Know that this is as curious as it gives\nliberation.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-fourth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the worship of the\nDevi in the Maha Pura _n_ am, S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n[The Eighth Book completed.]\n\n\n\nHere ends the Second Volume.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 1](bk09ch01.htm)\n\n"
