And the cowherds\' children, who\nwere in the jungle pasturing the cows, having heard that a demon had been\nkilled, left their cows and came to look at him. The cows in the mean while\nwent from one grass jungle to another. When the two brothers arrived, they\ncould not see any cows.\n\nThe cows and cowherds were dispersed: they lost their road, and wandered about\nthe grass and palm jungles. Climbing up trees, they (the cowherds\' children)\ncalled out to each other, and repeating names, they waived cloths in the air.\n\nIn the meantime, one of his companions came, and said to Krishnu, joining his\nhands, "O great king! the cowherds\' children and the cows having broken\nthrough (or destroyed,) the Mouj jungle have been mixed up together, just in\nthe same way as in the months of Sawun and Bhadon, rivers rushing along with\nhigh waves, mix in the sea." At this time they perceived that there was a fire\nblazing furiously. On seeing it, the cowherds and their companions, being\ngreatly alarmed and frightened, called out, "Krishnu! Krishnu! save us quickly\nfrom this fire or we shall all be instantly burnt to death."\n\np. 70\n\n[paragraph continues] Krishnu said, "All of you shut your eyes." When they had\nshut their eyes, Krishnu, having put out the fire in a second, caused another\ndelusion, and having taken off the cowherds\' children with the cows into a fig\ntree forest, told them to open their eyes.\n\nThe cowherds having opened their eyes, said, gazing round, "Where has that\nfire gone, Krishnu? When did we come into the fig tree forest: this is indeed\nstrange, Bulbeer?"\n\nHaving thus said, they accompanied Krishnu and Bulram with the cows to\nBrindabun, and each went home and mentioned, that Bulram had that day killed a\ndemon, named Purlunt; and that there had been a fire in the Mouj forest,\nwhich, through the power of Krishnu, had been extinguished. Having narrated\nthus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja! hearing these words from the mouths\nof the cowherds\' children, all the inhabitants of Bruj went out to see: but\nthey obtained no clue to the actions of Krishnu.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXI](psa22.htm)\n\n'
