(The soul after having passed forth from the body) follows the rays.\n\nThere is the vidya of him within the heart, which begins, 'There is this city\nof Brahman and in it the palace, the small lotus, and in it that small ether'\n( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 1). A subsequent section of that chapter--beginning with\nthe words, 'Now these veins of the heart'--describes at length the connexion\nof the veins and the rays, and the text then continues, 'When he departs from\nthis body, he departs upwards by those very rays,' and further on, 'By that\n\np. 379\n\nmoving upwards he reaches immortality.' From this we understand that the soul\npassing out by the hundred and first vein follows the rays.--A doubt here\narises as to whether the soul of him who dies by night as well as of him who\ndies by day follows the rays, or the soul of the latter only.--Since scripture\nmentions no difference, the Sutra teaches that the souls follow the rays in\nboth cases.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 19](sbe38299.htm)\n\n"
