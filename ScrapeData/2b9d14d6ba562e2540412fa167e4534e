Narada said :-- O Thou whose only wealth consists in asceticism! I am\nnow describing to you all those good stories; hear attentively. O Muni! This\nMaya and Her Power are incomprehensible even by those who are the foremost\namongst the Yogins. This whole Universe, moving and non-moving, from Brahma to\nthe blade of grass, is enchanted by that Unborn and Incomprehensible Maya;\ntherefore no one can escape from the hands of that Maya. One day I wanted to\nsee Hari, of wonderful deeds, and went out with lute in my hand from\nSatyaloka, to the lovely S\xc2\x92veta Dvipa (the residence of Vi _sn_ u) singing the\nbeautiful Sama hymns in tune with the seven Svaras. I saw there Gadadhara, the\nDeva of the Devas, with four arms holding disc in one of his hands. He\nresembled a newly-formed rain-cloud of S\xc2\x92yama colour. He was illumined with\nthe lustre of the Kaustubha jewel in his breast. He was wearing an yellow\napparel. His head was beautified with a lustrous crown. Thus the Bhagavan\nNaraya _n_ a was playing in amorous movements with the daughter of the ocean,\nfully capable to give one delight and enjoyment. Seeing me, the lovely Devi\nKamala, dear to Vasudeva, full of youth and beauty, decorated with ornaments,\nendowed with all auspicious signs, superior to all the women, went away at\nonce (to another room) from the presence of Janardana. The breast of Lak _s_\nmi Devi was becoming visible even through the cloth thrown over it; therefore\nshe went hurriedly to the inner compartment. Seeing this I asked Janardana,\nthe Deva of the Devas, the Lord of the worlds, and holding a garland of forest\ngrown flowers thus :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! O Slayer of Mura! O Padmanabha! Why has\nKamala Devi, the Mother of all the Lokas, on seeing me coming here, gone out\nof Your presence. O Lord of the worlds! I am not a rogue nor a cheat; I have\nconquered my passions and am become an ascetic; I have conquered even Maya.\nTherefore O Deva! What is the cause of the departure of the Kamala Devi from\nhere? Kindly explain this to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n12-20. Narada said :-- O Dvaipayana! Hearing my words, expressive of my pride,\nJanardana smiled and spoke to me in words sweet like the sound of a lute :--\n\xc2\x93O Narada! The rule in such cases is this :-- The wife of any man whatsoever\nought not to stay before any other male outsider than her husband. O Narada!\nIt is very hard to conquer Maya; even those, who by Pra _n_ ayama have\nconquered their Pra _n_ a Vayu, their organs of senses and their food, even\nthose Samkhya Yogins and the Devas are not able to conquer Maya. The words\nthat you have just now uttered that you\n\n\n\np. 583\n\n\n\nhave conquered Maya are not fit to come out of your mouth; for by your\nknowledge of music, it seems that you are enchanted with the sounds of the\nmusic. Brahma, I, S\xc2\x92iva, and the other Munis, none of us has been able as yet\nto conquer that Unborn Maya; how, then, can it be possible that you or any\nother man can conquer that Maya! Any embodied being, be he a Deva, a human\nbeing, or a bird, no one is able to conquer that Maya Unborn. Whoever is\nendowed with the three Gu _n_ as, be he a knower of the Vedas, or a Yogin, or\nconqueror of his passions, or all knowing, is not able to conquer Maya. The\nGreat Time (Kala) though formless, is one form of Maya and fashions this\nuniverse. All the Jivas are subservient to this Kala, be he a good literary\nperson, or of a mediocre nature, or an illiterate brute. This Kala sometimes\nmakes even a religious man that knows Dharma confounded and deluded; so you\nknow the nature of Maya is very incomprehensible and Her ways mysterious.\xc2\x94\n(Note: This Kala is of the fourth dimension, time and space.)\n\n\n\n21-23. O Dvaipayana! Thus saying, Vi _sn_ u stopped. I was greatly astonished\nand asked that Eternal Vasudeva, the Deva of the Devas, the Lord of the World,\n\xc2\x93O Lord of Rama! What is the form of Maya? How is She? What is the measure of\nHer strength? Where She resides? Whose substratum is She? Kindly tell these to\nme. O Preserver of the Universe! I am greatly desirous to see Maya; Shew Her\nto me quickly. O Lord of Rama! I am very eager to know Maya. Be graciously\npleased to describe tome the glory of Maya.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n24-36. Vi _sn_ u said :-- Maya resides everywhere throughout this whole\nUniverse; Her nature consists of the three Gu _n_ as; She is the substratum of\nall; She is omniscient, and acknowledged by all; invisible, and of diverse\nforms. O Narada! If you want to see Maya, then come quickly and mount with me\non Garu _d_ a; we both will go elsewhere and I will shew you that Maya,\ninvincible by those who have not conquered themselves. O Son of Brahma! Don\xc2\x92t\nbe depressed when you see Maya. Thus saying, Janardana Hari remembered Garu\n_d_ a and instantly he came to Hari. Janardana mounted on him and gladly made\nme also get up on his back and took me with Him. In a moment Garu _d_ a, went,\nat his command, with the speed of wind to the forest where the Bhagavan\ndesired to go. Mounting on Garu _d_ a we passed and saw on our way beautiful\nforests, nice lakes, rivers, towns, villages, huts of cultivators, towns close\nto the mountains, huts for cow-keepers in cowsheds, the beautiful hermitages\nof the Munis, lovely Jhils, tanks and lakes beautified with big lotuses,\nflocks of ewes, packs of wild boars, etc., till, at last, we came to a place\nclose to Kanauj. I saw there a beautiful divine tank; nice lotuses blossomed\nthere, spreading their sweet fragrance all around; the bees\n\n\n\np. 584\n\n\n\nwere making lovely humming noise and ravishing away the minds of men; various\nflowers, lilies, etc., were beautifying the place; Geese, Kara _nd_ avas, and\nChakravakas and other acquatic fowls were playing with their cackling noise,\nthe water was very sweet like milk; the tank was defying, as it were the\nocean. Seeing such a wonderful tank, the Bhagavan told me :-- \xc2\x93O Narada! See,\nhow beautiful is this deep tank with its clear waters, and adorned all over\nwith lotuses! The sweet voiced flamingoes are roaming on the lake making\nlovely sounds!\n\n\n\n37-54. We will bathe in this tank and then go to the city Kanauj. Thus saying,\nHe made me descend quickly from Garu _d_ a and He himself also got down. Then\nthe Bhagavan smilingly caught hold of my fore-finger and repeatedly praising\nthe glory of the tank took me to its bank. We rested a while on the cool\numbrageous beautiful bank when S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! Better bathe\nyou first in this tank; next I will bathe in this very holy pool of water. O\nNarada! Look! Look! How clear crystal-like is the water of this pool like the\nheart of a saint; see how it smells also fragrantly in contact with the\nlotuses on it.\xc2\x94 When the Bhagavan spoke thus to me; I kept my lute and deer\nskin aside and gladly went to the edge of the tank. Washing then my hands and\nfeet I tied my hair lock and, taking Kus\xc2\x92a grass, I performed my \xc3\x82chaman and,\npurifying myself, began to bathe myself in that tank. While I was bathing,\nHari was looking at me; by the time I took a dip, I saw that I quitted my male\nform and got a beautiful female form. Hari took away, then, my deer skin and\nlute and mounting on Garu _d_ a went away in a moment to His own residence.\nGetting the female form and decorated with excellent ornaments, my memory of\nmy previous male form vanished at once; I forgot all about my famous lute and\nforgot also Jagannatha, the Deva of the Devas. I then came out of the tank in\nthat enchanting woman form, saw the pool of water filled with clear limpid\nwater and adorned with lotuses. Seeing that, I began to think :-- \xc2\x93What is\nthis?\xc2\x94 and I became very much astonished. While I was thus meditating in my\nwoman form, a king, named Taladhvaja, came there, all on a sudden, on a\nchariot, accompanied by numerous elephants and horses. The King looked like a\nsecond Cupid; he was decorated with various ornaments on his various limbs; he\nwas just entering into his youth and he looked very enchanting. The King saw\nme at once and looking at me decked with divine ornaments and my moon-like\nface, was greatly astonished and asked me :-- \xc2\x93O Kalya _n_ i! Who are you? Are\nyou the daughter of a man or of a Naga (serpent) or of a Gandharva or of a\nDeva? I see you are now in your youth; why are you alone here? O Lovely-eyed!\n\n\n\np. 585\n\n\n\nHas any fortunate person married you? Or are you still unmarried? Speak all\nthese truly to me. O Fair-haired One! What are you looking at in this tank? O\nOne enchanting, as it were, like the Cupid! What is your desire? Say, O\nSlanting-eyed! My mind is ravished to hear your cuckoo-like voice. O One of\nthin waist! Choose me as your husband and enjoy various excellent things as\nyou like.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-eighth Chapter of the Sixth Book on Narada\xc2\x92s getting the\nfeminine form in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 29](bk06ch29.htm)\n\n'
