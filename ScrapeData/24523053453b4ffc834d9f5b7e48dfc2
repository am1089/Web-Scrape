Sing to the company (of the Maruts), growing up together, the strong among\nthe divine host [1](sbe3248.htm#an_7:58:1:1): they stir heaven and earth by\ntheir might, they mount up to the firmament from the abyss of Nir _ri_ ti\n[2](sbe3248.htm#an_7:58:1:2).\n\n2\\. Even your birth [1](sbe3248.htm#an_7:58:2:1) was with fire and fury, O\nMaruts! You, terrible, wrathful, never tiring! You who stand forth with might\nand strength; every one who sees the sun [2](sbe3248.htm#an_7:58:2:2), fears\nat your coming.\n\n3\\. Grant mighty strength to our lords, if the Maruts are pleased with our\npraise. As a trodden path furthers a man, may they further us; help us with\nyour brilliant favours.\n\n4\\. Favoured by you, O Maruts, a wise man wins a hundred, favoured by you a\nstrong racer wins a thousand, favoured by you a king also kills his enemy: may\nthat gift of yours prevail, O ye shakers.\n\n5\\. I invite these bounteous sons of Rudra [1](sbe3248.htm#an_7:58:5:1), will\nthese Maruts turn again to us? Whatever they hated secretly or openly, that\nsin we pray the swift ones to forgive.\n\n6\\. This praise of our lords has been spoken: may the Maruts be pleased with\nthis hymn. Keep far from us, O strong ones, all hatred, protect us always with\nyour favours!\n\np. 383\n\n### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Vasish _th_ a. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS.,\nTB., MS. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Dhaman is one of the cruces of translators, and it remains so after\nall that has been written on the subject by Bergaigne, III, 210 seq. There are\nmany words in the Veda which it is simply impossible to translate, because\ntheir meaning has not yet been differentiated, and they convey such general or\nrather vague concepts that it is utterly impossible to match them in our\nmodern languages. Translators are often blamed that they do not always render\nthe same Vedic by the same English word. It would be simply impossible to do\nso, because, according to the different surroundings in which it occurs, the\nsame word receives different shades of meaning which in English can only be\napproximately expressed by different words. Bergaigne is, no doubt, right when\nhe says that dha-man is derived from dha, to set or settle, and that it\ntherefore meant at first what is settled. From this he proceeds to argue that\nthe original meaning of dhaman, from which all others are derived, is law. But\nlaw is a very late and very abstract word, and we must never forget that words\nalways progress from the concrete to the abstract, from the material to the\nspiritual, and but seldom, and at a much later time, in an opposite direction.\nNow even if we were to admit that dhaman does not occur in the Veda in the\nsense of settlement, i. e. abode, this is certainly its most general meaning\nafterwards, and no one would maintain that a settlement, i. e. a household,\nwas called dhaman, because it involved a settlement, i. e. laws. The same\napplies to vrata. Bergaigne (III, 213) agrees with me that vrata should be\nderived from var, to surround, to guard, and not from var, to choose, but he\nthinks that it meant at once 'garde, protection,'\n\np. 384\n\nand not 'lieu clos.' I still hold that like \xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, vrata must have meant first\na real hedge, or \xe1\xbc\x95\xcf\x81\xce\xba\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, and then only an abstract enclosure, i. e. a law,\n\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xcf\x82. In this case we can see the actual transition of thought. People would\nbegin by saying, 'there is a fence here against your cattle,' and this would\nin time assume the meaning 'there is a defence against your cattle straying on\nmy meadow.' But it would be impossible to begin, as Bergaigne (p. 216) does,\nwith the abstract meaning of protection, law, and then return and use the word\nin such phrases as V, 46, 7. apa\xc2\xb4m vrate, 'within the pale of the waters.'\n\nDhaman, therefore, meant originally, I still believe, what was actually laid\ndown or settled, hence an abode. When, as in the Veda, it means law, I do not\nsay that this was necessarily derived from the meaning of abode. I only\nmaintain that it was a second, if not a secondary, meaning, and that, at all\nevents, the meaning of abode cannot be derived from that of law.\n\nAfter dhaman meant what is settled, it has sometimes to be translated by law,\nby nature, sometimes by class, or clan, where it comes very near to naman,\nname, while sometimes it may best be rendered by a general and abstract\nsuffix, or even by a plural. Thus in our passage, daivyasya dha\xc2\xb4mna _h_ is not\nvery different from devanam.\n\nWhat is peculiar to our passage is the genitive governed by tuvishman. After\nall the learning which Bergaigne has expended on the analysis of dhaman, he\ndoes not help us to a translation of our sentence. If we translate 'of the\ndivine law, powerful,' we have words, but no sense. I take daivyasya dha\xc2\xb4mna\n_h_ as a genitivus partitivus, such as AV. IV, 37, 5. oshadhinam virudham\nvirya\xcc\x83vati:. See Kuhn, Zeitschrift XIII, 120; Siecke, Genitivus, p. 14.\nGrassmann: 'Die machtig walten in der Gotter Wohnsitz.' Ludwig: 'Die von\ngottlicher natur, die starke.' He denies that tuvishman could be followed by\nthe genitive. I do not maintain that I am satisfied on that point. All I say\nin this as in many other cases is that my translation gives something which we\ncan understand. Let others give us something better.\n\np. 385\n\nNote 2.
