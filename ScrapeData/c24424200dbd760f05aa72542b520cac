 \nWhile, like an amorous matron, she  \nSpeeds to her own dear lord the sea.  \nThence hasting on your way behold  \nThe Pandyas\' 5 gates of pearl and gold.  \nThen, with your task maturely planned,  \nOn ocean\'s shore your feet will stand.  \nWhere, by Agastya\'s high decree,  \nMahendra, 6 planted in the sea,  \nWith tinted peaks against the tide  \nRises in solitary pride,  \nAnd glorious in his golden glow  \nSpurns back the waves that beat below.  \nFair mountain, bright with creepers\' bloom  \nAnd every tint that trees assume,  \nWhere Yaksha, God, and heavenly maid  \nMeet wandering in the lovely shade,  \nAt changing moon and solemn tide  \nBy Indra\'s presence glorified.  \nOne hundred leagues in fair extent  \nAn island 7 fronts the continent:  \nNo man may tread its glitering shore  \nWith utmost heed that isle explore,  \nFor the fair country owns the sway  \nOf Ravan whom we burn to day.  \n\nA mighty monster stands to keep  \nThe passage of the southern deep,  \nLifting her awful arms on high  \nShe grasps e\'en shadows as they fly.  \nSpeed through that isle, and onward still  \nWhere in mid sea the Flowery Hill 1b  \nHaises on high his bloomy head  \nBy saints and angels visited.  \nThere, with a hundred gleaming peaks  \nBright as the sun, the sky he seeks,  \nOne glorious peak the Lord of Day  \nGilds ever with his loving ray;  \nThereon ne\'er yet the glances fell  \nOf thankless wretch or infidel.  \nBow to that hill in reverence due,  \nAnd then once more your search pursue.  \nBeyond that glorious mountain hie,  \nAnd Suryavan, 2b proud hill is nigh.  \nYour rapid course yet farther bend  \nWhere Vaidyut\'s 3b airy peaks ascend.  \nThere trees of noblest sort, profuse  \nOf wealth, their kindly gifts produce.  \nTheir precious fruits, O Vanars, taste,  \nThe honey sip, and onward haste.  \nNext will ye see Mount Kunjar rise,  \nWho cheers with beauty hearts and eyes.  \nThere is Agastya\'s 4b mansion, decked  \nBv heaven\'s all moulding architect.  \nNear Bhogavati 5b stands, the place  \nWhere dwell the hosts of serpent race:  \nA broad-wayed city, walled and barred,  \nWhich watchful legions keep and guard,  \nThe fiercest of the serpent youth,  \nEach awful for his venomed tooth:  \nAnd throned in his imperial hall  \nIs Vasuki 6b who rules them all.  \nExplore the serpent city well,  \nSearch town and tower and citadel,  \nAnd scan each field and wood that lies  \nAround it, with your watchful eyes.  \nBeyond that spot your way pursue:  \nA noble mountain shall ye view,  \nNamed Rishabh, like a mighty bull,  \nWith gems made bright and beautiful.  \n\np. 376  \n\nAll trees of sandal flourish there  \nOf heavenly fragrance, rich and rare.  \nBut, though they tempt your longing eyes,  \nAvoid to touch them, and be wise.  \nFor Rohitas, a guardian band  \nOf fierce Gandharvas, round them stand,  \nWho five bright sovereign lords [1](ry316.htm#fn_714) obey,  \nIn glory like the God of Day.  \nHere by good deeds a home is won.  \nWith shapes like fire, the moon, the sun.  \nHere they who merit heaven by worth  \nDwell on the confines of the earth.  \nThere stay; beyond it, dark and drear,  \nLies the departed spirits\' sphere,  \nAnd, girt with darkness, far from bliss,  \nIs Yama\'s sad metropolis. [2](ry316.htm#fn_715)  \nSo far, my lords, o\'er land and sea  \nVour destined course is plain and free.  \nBeyond your steps you may not set,  \nWhere living thing ne\'er journeyed yet.  \nWith utmost care these realms survey,  \nAnd all you meet upon the way.  \nAnd, when the lady\'s course is traced,  \nBack to your king, O Vanars, haste.  \nAnd he who tells me he has seen.  \nAfter long search, the Maithil queen,  \nShall gain a noble guerdon: he  \nIn power and bliss shall equal me.  \nDear as my very life, above  \nHis fellows in his master\'s love;  \nI call him, yea though stained with crime.  \nMy kinsman from that happy time.\'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[374:1b](ry315.htm#fr_691) Suhotra, S\'arari, S\'aragulma, Gain, Gavak-ha,\nGavaya, Sushena, Gandhamadana, Ulkamukha, and Ananga.\n\n[374:2b](ry315.htm#fr_692) The modern Nerbudda.\n\n[374:3b](ry315.htm#fr_693) Krishnaveni is mentioned in the _Vishnu Purnna_ as\n\'the deep Krishnaven\' \'* but there appears to be no clue to its\nidentification.\n\n[374:4b](ry315.htm#fr_694) The modern Godavery.\n\n[374:5b](ry315.htm#fr_695) The Mekbaias or Mekalas according to the Patanas\nlive in the Vindhya hills, but here they appear among the peoples of the\nsouth.\n\n[374:6b](ry315.htm#fr_696) Utkal is still the native nameof Oriss*.\n\n[374:7b](ry315.htm#fr_697) The land of the people of the \'ten forts.\'\nProfessor Hall in a note on WlL.- SONS _Vishnu Purana_ , Vol. II. p.160 says:\n"The oral traditions of the vicinity to this day assign the nameof Dasarna to\na region lying to the east of the District of Cbundeyree."\n\n[374:8b](ry315.htm#fr_698) Avanti is one of the ancient names of the\ncelebrated Ujjayin or Oujein in Central India.\n\n[374:9b](ry315.htm#fr_699) Not identified\n\n[374:10b](ry315.htm#fr_700) Ayemukh means iron faced.
