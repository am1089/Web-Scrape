The murderer of a Brahma _n_ a, he who drinks spirituous liquor, the\nviolator of a Guru\'s bed, he who has connection with the female relatives of\nhis mother and of his father (within six degrees) or with sisters and their\nfemale offspring, he who steals (the gold of a Brahma _n_ a), an atheist, he\nwho constantly repeats blamable acts, he who does not cast off persons guilty\nof a crime causing loss of caste, and he who forsakes blameless (relatives),\nbecome outcasts, 1\n\n2\\. Likewise those who instigate others to acts causing loss of caste, 2\n\n3\\. And he who for a (whole) year associates with outcasts. 3\n\n4\\. To be an outcast means to be deprived of the right to follow the lawful\noccupations of twice-born men,\n\n5\\. And to be deprived after death of the rewards of meritorious deeds.\n\np. 281\n\n6\\. Some call (this condition) hell.\n\n7\\. Manu (declares, that) the first three (crimes, named above) cannot be\nexpiated. 7\n\n8\\. Some (declare, that a man) does not become an outcast (by having\nconnection) with female (relatives), except (when he violates) a Guru\'s bed. 8\n\n9\\. A woman becomes an outcast by procuring abortion, by connection with a\n(man of) lower (caste) and (the like heinous crimes). 9\n\n10\\. Giving false evidence, calumnies which will reach (the ears of) the king,\nan untrue accusation brought against a Guru (are acts) equal to mortal sins\n(mahapataka). 10\n\n11\\. (The guilt of a) minor offence (upapataka) rests on those who (have been\ndeclared to) defile the company (at a funeral dinner and have been named\nabove) before the bald man, on killers of kine, those who forget the Veda,\nthose who pronounce Vedic texts for the (last-mentioned sinners), students 11\n\np. 282\n\nwho break the vow of chastity, and those who allow the time for the initiation\nto pass.\n\n12\\. An officiating priest must be forsaken, if he is ignorant (of the rules\nof the sacrifice), a teacher, if he does not impart instruction, and (both) if\nthey commit crimes causing loss of caste. 12\n\n13\\. He who forsakes (them) under any other circumstances, becomes an outcast.\n\n14\\. Some declare, that he, also, who receives (a person who has unjustly\nforsaken his priest or teacher, becomes an outcast).\n\n15\\. The mother and the father must not be treated improperly under any\ncircumstances. 15\n\n16\\. But (the sons) shall not take their property. 16\n\n17\\. By accusing a Brahma _n_ a of a crime (the accuser commits) a sin equal\n(to that of the accused). 17\n\n18\\. If (the accused is) innocent, (the accuser\'s guilt is) twice (as great as\nthat of the crime which he imputed to the other). 18\n\n19\\. And he who, though able to rescue a weak man from injury, (does) not (do\nit, incurs as much guilt as he who injures the other).\n\n20\\. He who in anger raises (his hand or a weapon) 20\n\np. 283\n\nagainst a Brahma _n_ a, will be banished from heaven for a hundred years.\n\n21\\. If he strikes, (he will lose heaven) for a thousand (years).\n\n22\\. If blood flows, (he will lose heaven) for a number of years equal to\n(that of the particles of) dust which the spilt (blood) binds together. 22\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[280:1](sbe0285.htm#fr_1376) **XXI**. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 7, 21, 7-9, 11; I, 9, 24,\n6-9; Manu XI, 35; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 227.
