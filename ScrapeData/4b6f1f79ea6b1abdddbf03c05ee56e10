May we, the poor [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:1:1), succeed in many (pious)\nthoughts [2](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:1:2). May Agni with his pure splendour\nattain everything--\n\n2\\. He who understands the divine laws and the birth of the human race.\n\n3\\. He who is the child of the waters, the child of the trees, the child of\nthat which stands, and the child of that which moves.\n\n4\\. Even in the rock (they have done homage [?]) to him, in his dwelling\n[1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:4:1). (He is) like a protector [?]\n[2](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:4:2) of the clans, the immortal one, he who is of a\ngood mind.\n\n5\\. For he, Agni, (shows himself as) an earth-protecting (lord) of riches\n[1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:5:1) to the man who satisfies him with well-spoken\n(prayers).\n\n6\\. Protect, O knowing one, these beings, thou who knowest the birth of gods\nand men [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:6:1).\n\n7\\. He whom many nights (and dawns), in their different forms\n[1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:7:1), may increase, whom that which moves\n[2](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:7:2) and that which stands (increases), the god\npenetrated by _Ri_ ta--\n\n8\\. That Hot _ri_ who has sat down in the sun [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:8:1),\nhas been successfully worshipped [2](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:8:2) (by the human\nsacrificers), he who truly accomplishes all his works.\n\n9\\. On the cows, on the trees thou hast conferred excellence. May all men\nbring us tribute in the sun [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:9:1).\n\np. 71\n\n10\\. In many places men have worshipped thee. They have brought (thee) to\ndifferent places [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:10:1) as sons (divide) the property\nof an aged father [2](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:10:2).\n\n11 [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:11:1). (He is) like a greedy man\n[2](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:11:2) who goes straight (to his aim), like a mighty\narcher, like a fearful avenger [?] [3](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:11:3), impetuous\nin contests [4](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:11:4).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. I adopt Bergaigne's opinion on the word ari (see Religion Vedique, II,\n218 seq.).\n\nNote 2. The Padapa _th_ a has manisha\xc2\xb4 instead of manisha\xc2\xb4 _h_. See my\nProlegomena, 385; Lanman, 363. Prof. Max Muller proposes to translate: 'May we\nby wisdom overcome many enemies!' He writes: 'Is not vanema almost a standing\nformula as applied to enemies? Let us conquer the enemies. The enemies are\nmasculine in VII, 48, 3. vi _s_ van arya _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 vanvan, feminine in VI, 16, 27.\nvanvanta _h_ arya _h_ arati _h_. VIII, 39, 2. vi _s_ va _h_ arya _h_ arati\n_h_. X, 133, 3. vi _s_ va _h_ arataya _h_ arya _h_. IV, 50, 11. _g_ a _g_\nastam arya _h_ vanusham arati _h_ (repeated VII, 97, 9; cf. I, 29, 4).' For my\ntranslation I refer to II, 5, 7. stomam \xe2\x80\xa6 vanema; II, 11, 12. dhiyam vanema;\nI, 122, 14. arya _h_ gira _h_ ; X, 148, 3. arya _h_ va gira _h_ abhi ar _k_ a\nvidva\xc2\xb4n.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Or: even in the rock (they have done homage) to him, and in the\n(human) dwelling? I believe we must supply a verb on which the dative asmai\ndepends. Ludwig proposes to read duro _n_ am: 'within the stone is his\ndwelling.' Comp. II, 1, 1; VI, 48, 5.\n\nNote 2. I do not understand vi _s_ a\xc2\xb4m na vi _s_ va _h_. Ludwig translates 'er\nist der menschen allgemeiner, unsterblicher\n\np. 72\n\nfursorger.' But vi _s_ va does not mean 'allgemein,' and Ludwig omits na,\n'like.' One should expect a phrase like vi _s_ a\xc2\xb4m na vi _s_ pati _h_ , which\nof course is metrically impossible. Is it too bold to correct vi _s_ va _h_\ninto vi _s_ pa\xc2\xb4 _h_ , a word hitherto not found in the texts, but formed\nexactly like stipa\xc2\xb4, pa _s_ upa\xc2\xb4, tanupa\xc2\xb4 and others?--Prof. Max Muller takes\nasmai as dependent on svadhi\xc2\xb4 _h_ and vi _s_ va _h_ as belonging at the same\ntime to am _r i_ta _h_ and to vi _s_ a\xc2\xb4m. He translates: 'To him also who\ndwells in the rock and in the house, every immortal like every one among men\nis well disposed.'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VII, 10, 5. sa hi kshapavan abhavat rayi _n_ a\xc2\xb4m.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Most probably we have here not the accusative martan but the genitive\nmartam, which was confounded by the arrangers of the traditional text with the\naccusative and treated according to the Sandhi rules which govern the ending\n-an. See . Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 353 Bartholomae, Studien zur\nindogermanischen Sprachgeschichte, I, 48.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Lanman (p. 422) takes kshapa _h_ virupa _h_ as accusatives, and\ntranslates, 'Whom through many nights and mornings all beings worship.' I\nbelieve that they are nominatives, and that we should accentuate kshapa _h_.\nAs virupa is a regular epithet of naktosha\xc2\xb4sa, I think that kshapa _h_ is to\nbe understood as an elliptic plural similar to the elliptic duals usha\xc2\xb4sa or\nahani (comp. Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, 102), and that it means, 'the\nnights (and mornings).'--Comp. VI, 38, 4. vardhan ma\xc2\xb4sa _h_ _s_ arada _h_\ndya\xc2\xb4va _h_ indram, 'May months, years, days increase Indra's greatness.'\n\nNote 2. Of course _k_ a ratham is a mistake for karatham, as first pointed out\nby Benfey.\n\np. 73\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. On the locative sv\xcc\x83ar, see Lanman, 488; Joh. Schmidt in Kuhn's\nZeitschrift, XXVII, 306; Bartholomae in Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XV, 42. Comp.\nX, 61, 14. sv\xcc\x83a _h_ na ye trishadhasthe nishedu _h_.\n\nNote 2. Comp. X, 53, 2. aradhi hota nishada ya _g_ iyan.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. Is it not more probable that tribute was brought to Agni (comp. V, 1,\n10) than to the human worshippers? Possibly we should change sv\xcc\x83a _h_ na _h_\n(sv\xcc\x83ar _n_ a _h_ of the Sa _m_ hitapa _th_ a) into svar _n_ a _h_ , a vocative\nof the stem sv\xcc\x83ar _n_ _ri_ = sv\xcc\x83ar _n_ ara. The translation would be, 'All men\nhave brought tribute to thee, O sun-hero!'\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Comp. V, 11, 4. agnim nara _h_ vi bharante g _ri_ heg _ri_ he.\n\nNote 2. Regarding the metre, comp. above, 69, 8, note 1.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. This verse may possibly be a later addition. See Bergaigne, Recherches\nsur l'Histoire de la Sa _m_ hita, I, 61.\n\nNote 2. On g _ri_ dhnu, comp. Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 231.\n\nNote 3. Comp. I, 32, 14. ahe _h_ yata\xc2\xb4ram.\n\nNote 4. See above, 66, 6.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 71](sbe46021.htm)\n\n"
