For this\nsecond layer is that one which the A _s_ vins at that time laid down for them\n(the gods); and by laying it down they became everything here whatsoever there\nis here.\n\n8:2:2:22\\. The gods spake, 'The A _s_ vins have become everything here: think\nye upon this as to how we also may share in it!' They said, 'Meditate ye ( _k_\nit)!' whereby, no doubt, they meant to say, Seek ye a layer ( _k_ iti)! seek\nye in what way we also may share in it!' whilst meditating, they saw these Vai\n_s_ vadevi (All-gods') bricks.\n\n8:2:2:33\\. They said, 'The A _s_ vins have become everything here: with the\nhelp of the A _s_ vins let us lay down (bricks) along with the A _s_ vins'\nlayer!' With the help of the A _s_ vins they accordingly laid down (bricks)\nalong with the A _s_ vins' layer, whence they call this the A _s_ vins' layer.\nHence the end of these (bricks) is the same as that of the former ones; for\nthey laid them down with the help of the A _s_ vins along with the A _s_ vins'\nlayer.\n\n8:2:2:44\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the\n\np. 31\n\n[paragraph continues] All-gods' (bricks). These indeed are those same All-gods\nwho saw this second layer, and who came nigh with that life-sap: it is them he\nthereby bestows, that is, all these creatures. He lays them down in the range\nof the Reta _h_ si _k_ ; for the Reta _h_ si _k_ are these two (heaven and\nearth): within these two (worlds) he thus places creatures; whence there are\ncreatures within these two (worlds). He places (bricks) on every side: he thus\nplaces creatures everywhere, whence there are creatures everywhere. He places\nthem alongside of the regional ones 1: he thus places creatures in the regions\n(quarters); whence there are creatures in all the (four) quarters.\n\n8:2:2:55\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the All-gods' (bricks). When Pra\n_g_ apati had become relaxed, all creatures went forth from the midst of him,\nfrom that birth-place of theirs. When that (central part) of his body had been\nrestored, they entered him.\n\n8:2:2:66\\. Now the Pra _g_ apati who become relaxed is this very Agni (fire-\naltar) that is now being built up; and the creatures who went forth from the\nmidst of him are these same All-gods' bricks; and when he lays these down, he\ncauses those creatures, which went forth from the midst of him, to enter him.\nIn the range of the Reta _h_ si _k_ (he places the Vai _s_ vadevi bricks), for\nthe Reta _h_ si _k_ are the ribs, and the ribs\n\np. 32\n\nare the middle: he thus causes the creatures to enter him in the very middle.\nHe places them on all sides: on all sides he thus causes the creatures to\nenter him.\n\n8:2:2:77\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Vai _s_ vadevi (bricks). At\nthat time, when that (part) of his body had been restored, Pra _g_ apati\ndesired, 'May I create creatures, may I be reproduced!' Having entered into\nunion with the seasons, the waters, the vital airs, the year, and the A _s_\nvins, he produced these creatures; and in like manner does this Sacrificer, by\nentering into union with those deities, now produce these creatures. Hence\nwith all (of these bricks, the word) sa _g_ ush ('in union with') recurs.\n\n8:2:2:88\\. [He lays down the Vai _s_ vadevi bricks, with Va _g_. S. XIV, 7],\n'In union with the seasons,'--he thereby produced the seasons, and having\nentered into union with the seasons he produced (creatures);--'in union with\nthe ranges,'--the ranges, doubtless, are the waters, for by water everything\nis ranged (distributed or produced) here: having entered into union with the\nwaters he produced (creatures);--'in union with the gods,'--he thereby\nproduced the gods,--those who are called 'gods 1;'--'in union with the life-\nsustaining gods,'--the life-sustaining gods, doubtless, are the vital airs,\nfor by the vital airs everything living here is sustained; or, the life-\nsustaining gods are the metres, for by the metres (sacred writ) everything\nliving is sustained here; having entered into union with the vital airs he\nproduced creatures;--\n\np. 33\n\n[paragraph continues] 'for Agni Vai _s_ vanara,'--Agni Vai _s_ vanara\n('belonging to all men'), doubtless, is the year: having entered into union\nwith the year he produced creatures;--'May the A _s_ vins, the Adhvaryus,\nsettle thee here!'--having entered into union with the A _s_ vins he produced\ncreatures.\n\n8:2:2:99\\. 'In union with the Vasus,' he says on the right side: he thereby\nproduced the Vasus;--'in union with the Rudras,' he says at the back: he\nthereby produced the Rudras;--'in union with the \xc3\x82dityas,' he says on the left\nside: he thereby produced the \xc3\x82dityas;--'in union with the All-gods,' he says\nupwards: he thereby produced the All-gods. These (bricks) have the same\nbeginning and end, but are different in the middle: as to their having the\nsame beginning and end, it is because having become united with the deities in\nfront and behind, he produced creatures; and as to their being different in\nthe middle, it is that each time he produced different creatures from within\nhim.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[31:1](sbe4308.htm#fr_86) The \xc3\x82 _s_ vini (or Di _s_ ya) bricks were placed in\na circle round the centre, at the distance of a foot from where the central\nbrick (Svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a) was placed in the first layer,--that is to\nsay, in the third place from the centre. They were, moreover, placed in the\nsecond space (or at the distance of half a foot) from the two spines, see [p.\n23](sbe4307.htm#page_23), note [1](sbe4307.htm#fn_76). The five Vai _s_\nvadevis are then placed alongside of the \xc3\x82 _s_ vinis, so as to fill up the\n'first spaces,' that is to say, to lie on the spines themselves; each of the\ntwo half-foot bricks laid down in the south being, as it were, halved by the\nspine.\n\n[32:1](sbe4308.htm#fr_87) Lit. what they (viz. the Vedic hymns, according to\nthe commentator) call gods:--Yat ki _m_ _k_ id ity eva vedavada a _k_ akshate.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 2, 3.
