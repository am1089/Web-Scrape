It refers either to dreamless sleep or to union (sampatti); for this is\nmanifested.\n\nTexts as the one last quoted do not refer to the released soul, but either to\ndeep sleep or to 'union' (sampatti), i.e. the time of dying; the latter in\naccordance with the text 'then his speech is united (sampadyate) with his\nmind,--heat with the highest divinity' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 15, 1). In both those\nstates the soul attains to the highest Self and is unconscious. That in the\nstates of deep sleep and dying the soul is unconscious and that the released\nsoul is all-knowing, Scripture reveals. The text 'In truth he thus does not\nknow himself that he is I, nor does he know anything\n\np. 766\n\nthat exists. He is gone to utter annihilation. I see no good in this' ( _Kh_.\nUp. VIII, 11, 1) declares that the soul is unconscious in the state of deep\nsleep; and a subsequent text in the same section declares the released soul to\nbe all-knowing, 'He seeing these pleasures with the divine eye, i.e. the mind,\nrejoices' (VIII, 12, 5). The same is clearly stated in the text,'He who sees\nthis sees everything, and obtains everything everywhere' (VII, 2, 6, 2). That\nat death there is unconsciousness appears from the text, 'having risen from\nthese elements he vanishes again in them. When he has departed there is no\nmore knowledge ' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 13). From all this it follows that the\ntext as to the soul being held in embrace by the pra _g \xc3\xb1_a Self refers either\nto deep sleep or death.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'non-being.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 17.
