This reception of guests is an everlasting ( _S_ rauta)-sacrifice offered\nby the householder to Pra _g_ apati. 1\n\n2\\. The fire in the stomach of the guest (represents) the \xc3\x82havaniya, (the\nsacred fire) in the house of the host represents the Garhapatya, the fire at\nwhich the food for the guest is cooked (represents) the fire used for cooking\nthe sacrificial viands (the Dakshi _n_ agni). 2\n\n3\\. He who eats before his guest consumes the food, the prosperity, the issue,\nthe cattle, the merit which his family acquired by sacrifices and charitable\nworks.\n\n4\\. Food (offered to guests) which is mixed with milk procures the reward of\nan Agnish _t_ oma-sacrifice. Food mixed with clarified butter procures the\nreward of an Ukthya, food mixed with honey the reward of an Atiratra, food\naccompanied by meat the reward of a Dvada _s_ aha, (food and) water numerous\noffspring and long life. 4\n\n5\\. It is declared in the Veda, \'Both welcome and indifferent guests procure\nheaven (for their host).\'\n\np. 118\n\n6\\. When he gives food in the morning, at noon, and in the evening, (these\ngifts) are the Savanas (of that sacrifice offered to Pra _g_ apati). 6\n\n7\\. When he rises after his guest has risen (to depart), that act represents\nthe Udavasaniya ish _t_ i (of a Vedic sacrifice). 7\n\n8\\. When he addresses (the guest) kindly, that kind address (represents) the\nDakshi _n_ a. 8\n\n9\\. When he follows (his departing guest, his steps represent) the steps of\nVishnu. 9\n\n10\\. When he returns (after having accompanied his guest), that (act\nrepresents) the Avabh _ri_ tha, (the final bath performed after the completion\nof a sacrifice.)\n\n11\\. Thus (a Brahma _n_ a shall treat) a Brahma _n_ a, (and a Kshatriya and a\nVai _s_ ya their caste-fellows.)\n\n12\\. If a guest comes to a king, he shall make (his Purohita) honour him more\nthan himself. 12\n\n13\\. If a guest comes to an Agnihotrin, he himself 13\n\np. 119\n\nshall go to meet him and say to him: \'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, where\ndidst thou stay (last night)?\' (Then he offers water, saying): \'O faithful\nfulfiller of thy vows, here is water.\' (Next he offers milk or the like,\nsaying): \'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may (these fluids) refresh\n(thee).\'\n\n14\\. (If the guest stays at the time of the Agnihotra, he shall make him sit\ndown to the north of the fire and) murmur in a low voice, before offering the\noblations: \'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy heart desires;\'\n\'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy will is;\' \'O faithful\nfulfiller of thy vows, may it be as thy wish is;\' \'O faithful fulfiller of thy\nvows, may it be as thy desire is.\' 14\n\n15\\. If a guest comes, after the fires have been placed (on the altar), but\nbefore the oblations have been offered, (the host) himself shall approach him\nand say to him: \'O faithful fulfiller of thy vows give me permission; I wish\nto sacrifice.\' Then he shall sacrifice, after having received permission. A\nBrahma _n_ a declares that he commits a sin if he sacrifices without\npermission. 15\n\n16\\. He who entertains guests for one night obtains earthly happiness, a\nsecond night gains the middle air, a third heavenly bliss, a fourth the world\nof unsurpassable bliss; many nights procure endless worlds. That has been\ndeclared in the Veda.\n\n17\\. If an unlearned person who pretends to be\n\np. 120\n\n[paragraph continues] (worthy of the appellation) \'guest\' comes to him, he\nshall give him a seat, water, and food, (thinking) \'I give it to a learned\nBrahma _n_ a.\' Thus (the merit) of his (gift) becomes (as) great (as if a\nlearned Brahma _n_ a had received it).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[117:1](sbe0242.htm#fr_593) **7**. \'Pra _g_ apatya may mean either "created by\nPra _g_ apati" or sacred to Pra _g_ apati."\'--Haradatta.\n\n[117:2](sbe0242.htm#fr_594) in the first Sutra the reception of guests had\nbeen compared to an everlasting Vedic sacrifice. This analog is traced further\nin detail in this Sutra. One of the chief characteristics of a Vedic sacrifice\nis the vitana, or the use of three sacred fires. Hence \xc3\x82pastamba shows that\nthree fires also are used in offering hospitality to guests.\n\n[117:4](sbe0242.htm#fr_595) Regarding the Agnish _t_ oma and the other\nsacrifices mentioned, see Aitareya-brahma _n_ a III, 8; IV, 1; IV, 4.\n\n[118:6](sbe0242.htm#fr_596) The morning, midday, and evening offerings offered\nat the great Vedic sacrifices are called Savanas. The object of this Sutra is\nto prescribe the hospitable reception of guests at a times of the day, and to\nfurther describe the similarity of a guest-offering to a Vedic sacrifice.\n\n[118:7](sbe0242.htm#fr_597) Regarding the Udavasaniya ish _t_ i, see Aitareya-\nbrahma _n_ a VIII, 5. It is the \'concluding ish _t_ i.\'\n\n[118:8](sbe0242.htm#fr_598) Dakshi _n_ a is the reward given to priests who\nofficiate at a sacrifice.\n\n[118:9](sbe0242.htm#fr_599) \'The steps of Vishnu\' are three steps which the\nsacrificer has to make between the Vedi and the \xc3\x82havaniya-fire. See Pet. Diet.\ns. v.\n\n[118:12](sbe0242.htm#fr_600) \'A guest,\' i.e. such a one as described above,\nII, 3, 6, 4 and 5.\n\n[118:13](sbe0242.htm#fr_601) An Agnihotrin is a Brahma _n_ a who offers\ncertain daily burnt offerings called Agnihotra. The translation of the last\nclause renders tarpayantu, the reading of the Atharva-veda.\n\n[119:14](sbe0242.htm#fr_602) According to some, all these sentences must be\npronounced; according to Haradatta, one only, which may be selected\noptionally.\n\n[119:15](sbe0242.htm#fr_603) Haradatta states that the Brahma _n_ a mentioned\nin the text is the \xc3\x82harva _n_ a-brahma _n_ a. See Atharva-veda. XV, 11-12.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 4, Kha _n_ _d_ a 8](sbe0243.htm)\n\n'
