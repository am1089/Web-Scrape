Prayer at the consecration of a king.\n\n1\\. Himself prosperous (bhuto), he does put strength into the beings\n(bhuteshu); he became the chief lord of the beings (bhutanam). To his\nconsecration death does come: may he, the king, favour this kingdom!  \n2\\. Come forth hither-do not glance away-as a mighty guardian, slayer of\nenemies! Step hither, thou who prosperest thy friends: the gods shall bless\nthee!  \n3\\. As he did step hither all (men) did attend him. Clothed in grace, he\nmoves, shining by his own lustre. This is the great name of the manly Asura;\nendowed with every form (quality) he entered upon immortal (deeds).  \n4\\. Thyself a tiger, do thou upon this tiger-skin stride (victorious) through\nthe great regionst All the clans shall wish for thee, and the heavenly waters,\nrich in sap!  \n5\\. The heavenly waters, rich in sap, flow joyously, (and too) those in the\nsky and upon the earth: with the lustre of all of these do I sprinkle thee.  \n6\\. They have sprinkled thee with their lustre., the heavenly waters rich in\nsap. May Savitar thus fashion thee, that thou shalt prosper thy friends!  \n7\\. (The waters) thus embracing him, the tiger, promote him, the lion, to\ngreat good fortune. Him, the leopard in the midst of the waters, as though\nstanding in the ocean, the beneficent (floods, or the vigorous priests)\ncleanse thoroughly!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3.
