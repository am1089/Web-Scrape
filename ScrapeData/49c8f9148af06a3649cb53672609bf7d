A man who is a friend of all, who endures all, who is devoted to\ntranquillity 1, who has subdued his senses, and from whom fear and wrath have\ndeparted, and who is self-possessed 2, is released. He who moves among all\nbeings as if they were like himself 3, who is self-controlled, pure, free from\nvanity 4 and egoism, he is, indeed, released from everything. And he, too, is\nreleased who is equable towards both life and death 5, and likewise pleasure\nand pain, and gain and loss, and (what is) agreeable and odious 6. He who is\nnot attached to any one, who contemns no one, who is free from the pairs of\nopposites, and whose self is free from affections 7, he is, indeed, released\nin every way. He who has no enemy, who has no kinsmen, who has no child, who\nhas abandoned piety, wealth, and lust altogether, and who has no desire, is\nreleased. He who is not pious and not impious 8, who casts off (the merit or\nsin) previously accumulated, whose self is tranquillised by the exhaustion of\nthe primary elements of the body 9, and who is free from the pairs of\nopposites, is released. One who does no action 10, and who has no desire,\nlooks on this universe as transient,\n\np. 247\n\nlike an A _s_ vattha tree 1, always full of birth, death., and old age 2.\nHaving his understanding. always (fixed) upon indifference to worldly objects,\nsearching for his own faults 3, he procures the release of his self from bonds\nin no long time. Seeing the self void of smell 4, void of taste, void of\ntouch, void of sound, void of belongings, void of colour, and unknowable, he\nis released. He who sees the enjoyer of the qualities 5, devoid of qualities,\ndevoid of the qualities of the five elements 6, devoid of form, and having no\ncause, is released. Abandoning by the understanding 7 all fancies bodily and\nmental 8, he gradually obtains tranquillity 9, like fire devoid of fuel. He\nwho is free from all impressions 10, free from the pairs of opposites, without\nbelongings, and who moves among the collection of organs with penance 11, he\nis indeed released. Then freed from all impressions, he attains to the eternal\n\np. 248\n\n[paragraph continues] Supreme Brahman, tranquil, unmoving, constant,\nindestructible 1. After this I shall explain the science of concentration of\nmind, than which there is nothing higher, (and which teaches) how devotees\nconcentrating (their minds) perceive the perfect self 2. I will impart\ninstruction regarding it accurately. Learn from me the paths 3 by which one\ndirecting the self within the self perceives the eternal  4 (principle).\nRestraining the senses, one should fix the mind on the self; and having first\nperformed rigorous penance 5, he should practise concentration of mind for\nfinal emancipation. Then the talented Brahma _n_ a, who has practised penance,\nwho is constantly practising concentration of mind, should act on (the\nprecepts of) the science of concentration of mind 6, seeing the self in the\nself by means of the mind 7. If such a good man is able to concentrate the\nself on the self, then he, being habituated to exclusive meditation 8,\nperceives the self in the self. Being\n\np. 249\n\nself-restrained and self-possessed 1, and always concentrating his mind, and\nhaving his senses subjugated, he who has achieved proper concentration of mind\n2 sees the self in the self, As a person having seen one in a dream,\nrecognises him (afterwards), saying, 'This is he;' so does one who has\nachieved proper concentration of mind perceive the self 3. And as one may show\nthe soft fibres, after extracting them from the Mu\xc3\xb1 _g_ a, so does a devotee\nsee the self extracted from the body. The body is caned the Mu\xc3\xb1 _g_ a; the\nsoft fibres stand 4 for the self. This is the excellent illustration\npropounded by those who understand concentration of mind. When an embodied\n(self) properly perceives the self concentrated 5, then there is no ruler over\nhim, since he is the lord of the triple world 6. He obtains various bodies as\nhe pleases; and casting aside old age and death, he grieves not and exults\nnot. The man who\n\np. 250\n\nhas acquired concentration of mind, and who is self-restrained, creates for\nhimself even the divinity of the gods 1; and abandoning the transient body, he\nattains to the inexhaustible Brahman. When (all) beings are destroyed, he has\nno fear; when (all) beings are afflicted, he is not afflicted by anything 2.\nHe whose self is concentrated, who is free from attachment, and of a tranquil\nmind, is not shaken by the fearful effects of attachment and affection 3,\nwhich consist in pain and grief 4. Weapons do not pierce him 5; there is, no\ndeath for him; nothing can be seen anywhere in the world happier than he.\nProperly concentrating his self, he remains steady to the self; and freed from\nold age and grief, he sleeps at ease. Leaving this human frame, he assumes\nbodies at pleasure. But one who is practising concentration should never\nbecome despondent 6. When one who has properly achieved concentration\nperceives the self in the self, then he forthwith ceases to feel any\nattachment to Indra himself 7.\n\np. 251\n\n[paragraph continues] Now listen how one habituated to exclusive meditation\nattains concentration. Thinking 1 of a quarter seen before, he should steady\nhis mind within and not out of the city in which he dwells. Remaining within\n(that) city, he should place his mind both in its external and internal\n(operations) in that habitation in which he dwells. When, meditating in that\nhabitation, he perceives the perfect one, his mind should not in anyway wander\noutside. Restraining the group of the senses, in a forest 2 free from noises\nand unpeopled, he should meditate on the perfect one within his body with a\nmind fixed on one point. He\n\np. 252\n\nshould meditate on his teeth 1, palate, tongue, neck, and throat likewise, and\nalso the heart, and likewise the seat of the. heart. That talented pupil, O\ndestroyer of Madhu! having been thug instructed by me, proceeded further to\ninterrogate (me) about the piety (required) for final emancipation, which is\ndifficult to explain. 'How does this food eaten from time to time become\ndigested in the stomach? How does it turn to juice, and how also to blood? And\nhow, too, do the flesh, and marrow, and muscles, and bones--which all (form)\nthe bodies for embodied (selfs)--develop in a woman as that (self) develops?\nHow, too, does the strength develop? (And how is it also) about the removal of\nnon-nutritive (substances) 2, and of the excretions, distinctly? How, too,\ndoes he breathe inwards or outwards? And what place does the self occupy,\ndwelling in the self 3? And how does the soul moving about carry the body? And\nof what colour and of what description (is it when) he leaves it? O sinless\nvenerable sir! be pleased to state this accurately to me.' Thus questioned by\nthat Brahma _n_ a, O Madhava! I replied 4, 'O you of mighty arms! O\n\np. 253\n\nrestrainer of (your) foes! according to what (I had) heard. As one placing any\nproperty in his store-room should fix his mind on the property 1, so placing\none's mind in one's body, and (keeping) the passages confined, one should\nthere look for the self and avoid heedlessness 2. Being thus always assiduous\nand pleased in the self, he attains in a short time to that Brahman, after\nperceiving which he understands the Pradhana 3. He is not to be grasped by the\neye, nor by any of the senses. Only by the mind (used) as a lamp is the great\nself perceived 4. He has hands and feet on all sides; he has eyes, heads, and\nfaces on all sides; he has cars on all sides; he stands pervading everything\nin the world 5. The soul sees the self 6 come out from the body; and\nabandoning his body, he perceives the self,--holding it to be the immaculate\nBrahman,--with, as it were, a mental smile 7. And then depending upon it thus,\nhe attains final emancipation in me 8.\n\np. 254\n\nThis whole mystery I have declared to you, O best of Brahma _n_ as 1! I will\nnow take my leave, I will go away; and do you (too) go away, O Brahma _n_ a!\naccording to your pleasure.' Thus addressed by me, O K _ri_ sh _n_ a! that\npupil, possessed of great penance,--that Brahma _n_ a of rigid vows,--went\naway as he pleased.\n\nVasudeva said:\n\nHaving spoken to me, O son of P _ri_ tha! these good words relating to the\npiety (required) for final emancipation, that best of Brahma _n_ as\ndisappeared then and there. Have you listened to this, O son of P _ri_ tha!\nwith a mind (fixed) on (this) one point only 2? For on that occasion, too,\nsitting in the chariot you heard this same (instruction). It is my belief, O\nson of P _ri_ tha! that this is not easily understood by a man who is\nconfused, or who has not acquired knowledge with his inmost soul purified 3.\nWhat I have spoken, O chief of the descendants of Bharata! is a great mystery\n(even) among the gods. And it has never yet been heard by any man in this\nworld, O son of P _ri_ tha! For, O sinless one! there is no other man than you\nworthy to hear it. Nor is it easily to be understood by (one whose) internal\nself (is) confused. The world of the gods 4, O son of Kunti! is filled by\nthose who perform\n\np. 255\n\nactions. And the gods are not pleased with a cessation of the mortal form 1.\nFor as to that eternal Brahman, O son of Pritha! that is the highest goal,\nwhere one, forsaking the body, reaches immortality and is ever happy. Adopting\nthis doctrine, even those who are of sinful birth, women, Vai _s_ yas, and _S_\nudras likewise, attain the supreme goal. What then (need be said of) Brahma\n_n_ as, O son of P _ri_ tha 2! or well-read Kshatriyas, who are constantly\nintent on their own duties, and whose highest goal is the world of the\nBrahman? This has been stated with reasons; and also the means for its\nacquisition; and the fruit of its full accomplishment, final emancipation, and\ndetermination regarding misery 3. O chief of the descendants of Bharata! there\ncan be no other happiness beyond this. The mortal, O son of Pa _n_ du! who,\npossessed of talents, full of faith, and energetic 4, casts aside as\nunsubstantial the (whole) substance of this world 5, he forthwith attains the\nhighest goal by these means. This is all that is to be said, there is nothing\nfurther than this. Concentration of mind comes to him, O son of P _ri_ tha!\nwho practises concentration of mind constantly throughout six months 6.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[245:1](sbe0830.htm#fr_1142) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says the strength of the\nimpression in the former birth would give him this knowledge in the subsequent\nbirth.\n\n[245:2](sbe0830.htm#fr_1143) Cf.

Gita, [p. 111](sbe0817.htm#page_111).\n\n[245:8](sbe0831.htm#fr_1149) We now begin, as Nilaka _nth_ a points out, the\nanswer to the question put above by Ka _s_ yapa about the emancipation of the\nself. Placid, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra renders to mean 'silent, taciturn.' See [p.\n234](sbe0828.htm#page_234) supra.\n\n[245:9](sbe0831.htm#fr_1150) The path of knowledge, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra;\nthe Brahman, says Nilaka _nth_ a. Abandoning each element = absorbing the\ngross into the subtle elements, and so forth, Nilaka _nth_ a,; abandoning each\nelementary mode of worship till one reaches that of contemplating the absolute\nBrahman, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[246:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1151) This, in the terminology of the Vedanta, means\nkeeping the mind from everything save 'hearing' &c. about the Brahman.\n\n[246:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1152) One who has his mind under his control. But see\nGita, [p. 63](sbe0806.htm#page_63).\n\n[246:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1153) Cf. Gita, [p. 71](sbe0808.htm#page_71).\n\n[246:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1154) I. e. the desire to be honoured or respected, Ar\n_g_ una Mi _s_ ra. Cf. Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p. 161](sbe0823.htm#page_161).\n\n[246:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1155) Who does not care when death comes.\n\n[246:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1156) Cf. [p. 51](sbe0804.htm#page_51) supra.\n\n[246:7](sbe0831.htm#fr_1157) Cf. Gita for all this, pp.\n[101](sbe0814.htm#page_101), [103](sbe0815.htm#page_103),\n[125](sbe0820.htm#page_125), &c.\n\n[246:8](sbe0831.htm#fr_1158) Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 101.\n\n[246:9](sbe0831.htm#fr_1159) Nilaka _nth_ a says this means the constituents\nof the body. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, 'Pra _n_ a or life-wind,' &c. They are\nseven. See gloss on _Kh_ andogya-upanishad, p. 441, and [p.\n343](sbe0854.htm#page_343) infra.\n\n[246:10](sbe0831.htm#fr_1160) Because, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, he has no\ndesire. Nilaka _nth_ a says this means an ascetic, sannyasin. See [p.\n257](sbe0832.htm#page_257) infra, note  [1](sbe0832.htm#fn_1217).\n\n[247:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1161) Cf. Gita, [p. 111](sbe0817.htm#page_111), where\n_S_ a _n_ kara explains the name to mean 'what will not remain even till to-\nmorrow.'\n\n[247:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1162) Cf. Gita, [p. 109](sbe0816.htm#page_109), and\nother passages.\n\n[247:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1163) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra has a different reading,\nwhich means 'particularly observing the evils of (the three kinds of) misery.'\n\n[247:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1164) Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 119; Mu _nd_ aka, pp. 267; and\nMandukya, p. 371.\n\n[247:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1165) Cf. Gita, pp. [104](sbe0815.htm#page_104), p.\n[105](sbe0815.htm#page_105), and Ka _th_ a, p. 112.\n\n[247:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1166) Nilakan _th_ a says this refers to the gross\nelements, the next expression to the subtle ones, and being free from these\ntwo, he is 'devoid of qualities,' viz. the three qualities.\n\n[247:7](sbe0831.htm#fr_1167) Cf. Gita, [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65).\n\n[247:8](sbe0831.htm#fr_1168) I. e. those which cause bodily and mental\nactivity.\n\n[247:9](sbe0831.htm#fr_1169) Cf. Maitri, p. 178. The original is the famous\nword 'Nirva _n_ a.'\n\n[247:10](sbe0831.htm#fr_1170) Scil. derived from false knowledge, says Ar _g_\nuna Mi _s_ ra. Nilaka _nth_ a says all impressions from outside oneself which\nare destroyed by those produced from concentration of mind, &c. See [p.\n391](sbe0863.htm#page_391) infra.\n\n[247:11](sbe0831.htm#fr_1171) I. e. all those operations by which the internal\nman is rendered pure and free from all taints; see below, p. 248, where Nilaka\n_nth_ a renders it as 'the performance of one's duty which is called penance.'\nBut see, too, pp. [74](sbe0809.htm#page_74), [119](sbe0819.htm#page_119),\n[166](sbe0824.htm#page_166) supra. The meaning seems to be that the p. 247 man\nin question lets his senses work, but does not permit himself to be in any way\nidentified with their operations. Cf. Gita, [p. 64](sbe0807.htm#page_64).\n\n[248:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1172) Cf. the expressions at Gita, [p.\n45](sbe0804.htm#page_45). 'Unmoving,' which occurs at \xc3\x8e _s_ a, p. 10, is there\nexplained by _S_ a _n_ kara to mean 'always the same.' The same sense is given\nby Mahidhara. Weber's _S_ atapatha, p. 980.\n\n[248:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1173) 'Perfect' would seem to mean here free from all\nbonds or taints, the absolute.\n\n[248:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1174) I. e. sources of knowledge, says Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra.\n\n[248:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1175) Cf. as to 'directing the self within the self,'\nGita, [p. 69](sbe0808.htm#page_69). Nilaka _nth_ a says, 'paths, means of\nmental restraint; the self, mind; in the self, in the body.'\n\n[248:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1176) See p. 247, note  11. Nilaka _nth_ a's note there\nreferred to occurs on this passage. See also [p. 166](sbe0824.htm#page_166),\nnote  [1](sbe0824.htm#fn_737) supra.\n\n[248:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1177) It is not easy to say what this science is. Is it\nPata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali's system that is meant? No details occur to enable one to\nidentify the 'science.' But, probably, no system is alluded to.\n\n[248:7](sbe0831.htm#fr_1178) See note  4 above.\n\n[248:8](sbe0831.htm#fr_1179) Nilaka _nth_ a has a very forced explanation of\nthe original word, p. 249 which also occurs further on; he takes the meaning\nto be, 'he who is habituated to that by which the One is attained, viz.\nmeditation.'\n\n[249:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1180) The original is the same as at Gita, [p.\n63](sbe0806.htm#page_63).\n\n[249:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1181) That is to say, one who has got the power of\nconcentrating his mind as he pleases; and the words 'always concentrating'\n&c., just before, would mean 'one who always exercises that power.'\n\n[249:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1182) I. e. having perceived the self in the state of\nconcentration, he sees the whole universe to be the self in this state when\nthe concentration has ceased, Nilaka _nth_ a. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says,\n'having perceived the self at the time of concentration, he recognises it as\nthe same at the time of direct perception,' meaning, apparently, the time of\nfinal emancipation.\n\n[249:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1183) I. e. the reality, which in this simile forms the\nsubstratum of what are called the fibres; the simile is in the Ka _th_\na-upanishad; see, too, Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p. 176](sbe0825.htm#page_176).\n\n[249:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1184) I. e. on the supreme self, as above explained.\n\n[249:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1185) Cf. Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p.\n161](sbe0823.htm#page_161); _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 290; and B _ri_\nhadaranyaka, p. 218; _Kh_ andogya, p. 523; Aitareya, p. 26; Kaushitaki, p.\n126.\n\n[250:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1186) I do not quite understand the original. The other\nreading, dehatvam for devatvam, is not more intelligible. But comparing the\ntwo, the meaning seems to be, that the divinity of the gods, i. e. their\nqualities and powers as gods, are within his reach, if he likes to have them.\n\n[250:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1187) Cf. Gita, [p. 107](sbe0816.htm#page_107).\n\n[250:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1188) Affection is the feeling that a thing is one's\nown; attachment is the feeling of liking one has for a thing acquired with\ndifficulty, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[250:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1189) Pain appears to be the feeling immediately\nfollowing on hurt or evil suffered; grief is the constant state of mind which\nis a later result.\n\n[250:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1190) Cf. Yoga-sutra Bhashya, p. 208.\n\n[250:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1191) Cf. Gita, [p. 70](sbe0808.htm#page_70).\nDespondency is the feeling that one has not acquired 'concentration' after\nmuch practice, and that therefore the practice should be abandoned.\n\n[250:7](sbe0831.htm#fr_1192) The other reading here may be rendered, 'Then\nforthwith Indra himself esteems him highly.'\n\n[251:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1193) This is all rather mystical. Nilaka _nth_ a takes\n'city' to mean body,' and 'habitation' to mean the muladhara, or other similar\nmystic centre within the body, where, according to the Yoga philosophy, the\nsoul is sometimes to be kept with the life-winds, &c. 'Thinking of a quarter,'\n&c., he explains to mean 'meditating on the instruction he has received after\nstudying the Upanishads.' I do not understand the passage well. 'City' for\n'body' is a familiar use of the word. Cf. Gita, [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65).\nThe original word for habitation occurs at Aitareya-upanishad, p. 199, where\n_S_ a _n_ kara explains it to mean 'seat.' Three 'seats' are there mentioned,\n--the organs of sight, &c.; the mind; and the \xc3\x82ka _s_ a in the heart. There,\ntoo, the body is described as a 'city,' and Anandagiri explains habitation to\nmean 'seat of amusement or sport.' Here, however, the meaning seems to be that\none should work for concentration in the manner indicated, viz. first fix the\nmind on the city where one dwells, then on the particular part of it oftenest\nseen before, them one's own habitation, then the various parts of one's body,\nand finally one's own heart and the Brahman within it. Thus gradually\ncircumscribed in its operations, the mind is better fitted for the final\nconcentration on the Brahman. As to external and internal operations, cf. note\n8, p. 247. The perfect one is the Brahman. Cf. Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p.\n171](sbe0824.htm#page_171). As to avasatha, which we have rendered by\n'habitation,' see also Ma _nd_ ukya, p. 340 . By B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p.\n751; and the alternative sense suggested by _S_ a _n_ kara on the Aitareya,\nloc. cit.\n\n[251:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1194) Cf. Maitri-upanishad, p. 100.\n\n[252:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1195) Nilaka _nth_ a cites numerous passages from works\nof the Yoga philosophy in illustration of this. He takes 'heart' to mean the\nBrahman seated in the heart (cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 528), and 'the seat of the\nheart' to mean the one hundred and one passages of the heart. The latter\nexpression Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra seems to render by 'mind.' See also generally\non this passage, Maitri-upanishad, p. 133, and Yoga-sutra III, 1 and 28 seq.,\nand commentary there.\n\n[252:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1196) Literally, 'those which are void of strength.' I\nadopt Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's reading. The other reading literally means\n'obstructions.'\n\n[252:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1197) The self here means the body, I take it. See p.\n248 supra.\n\n[252:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1198) The reply does not appear here. Nilaka _nth_ a\nsays that the succeeding chapters contain it. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra seems to\nsay that the answer has been already given. The context here is obscure.\n\n[253:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1199) Nilaka _nth_ a says the original means household\neffects; Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says wealth, and adds, the mind is fixed on it\nfrom fear of others finding it out.\n\n[253:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1200) Cf. Sanatsugatiya, [p.\n152](sbe0823.htm#page_152). Here, however, the sense is the ordinary one.\n\n[253:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1201) I. e. all nature, that from which the universe is\ndeveloped.\n\n[253:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1202) Cf. Ka _th_ a, pp. 117-130. See _S_ anti Parvan\n(Moksha) CCXL, 16.\n\n[253:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1203) Cf. Gita, [p. 103](sbe0815.htm#page_103). The\nstanza occurs often in the Bharata. This, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, answers\nthe question 'how the soul carries the body.' The soul can do that as it is\nall-pervading.\n\n[253:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1204) The individual soul, which has acquired true\nknowledge, perceives the self to be distinct from the body. See p. 249 supra.\n\n[253:7](sbe0831.htm#fr_1205) I. e. at the false notions which he entertained.\nNilaka _nth_ a says, 'smile, i.e. amazement that he should have been deceived\nby the mirage-like course of worldly life.'\n\n[253:8](sbe0831.htm#fr_1206) I. e. final emancipation and assimilation with\nthe supreme 'depending upon it thus' = taking refuge with the Brahman in the\nway above stated.\n\n[254:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1207) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, the only questions\namong those stated above, which are of use for final emancipation, have been\nhere answered. The others should be looked for elsewhere.\n\n[254:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1208) The original words here are identical with those\nat Gita, [p. 139](sbe0821.htm#page_139).\n\n[254:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1209) I adopt Nilaka _nth_ a's reading here. Ar _g_ una\nMi _s_ ra reads 'vi _g_ agdhena,' which he explains to mean 'one who eats\nkinds of food incompatible with one another.' A third reading is 'k _ri_\ntaghnena,' ungrateful!\n\n[254:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1210) See Gita [p. 84](sbe0811.htm#page_84).\n\n[255:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1211) Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 234, where _S_ a\n_n_ kara quotes the original stanza, but with a reading which means, 'And the\ngods are not pleased at mortals rising above (them).' That is a better\nreading.\n\n[255:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1212) See Gita, pp. [85](sbe0811.htm#page_85),\n[86](sbe0811.htm#page_86), where the words are nearly identical with those in\nthe text.\n\n[255:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1213) This is not quite clear. Does 'determination\nregarding misery,' the original of which is du _h_ khasya ka vinir _n_ aya _h_\n, mean 'conclusion of all misery?' Comp. Gita, [p. 79](sbe0810.htm#page_79).\n\n[255:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1214) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says this means assiduous.\n\n[255:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1215) I. e. wealth and so forth, says Nilaka _nth_ a.\nCf. 'human wealth' at Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p. 161](sbe0823.htm#page_161).\n\n[255:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1216) Cf. Maitri-upanishad, p. 154. The copy of Ar _g_\nuna Mi _s_ ra's p. 256 commentary which I have used, says that the Anugita\nends here. But, as we have shown, there is a verse coming further on, which\n_S_ a _n_ karakarya cites as from the Anugita. In the printed copies of the\nMahabharata the next chapter is called the Brahma _n_ agita.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter V](sbe0832.htm)\n\n"
