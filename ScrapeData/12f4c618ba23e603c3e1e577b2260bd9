Against sorcerers and demons.\n\n1\\. May this oblation carry hither the sorcerers, as a river (carries) foam!\nThe man or the woman who has performed this (sorcery), that person shall here\nproclaim himself!  \n2\\. This vaunting (sorcerer) has come hither: receive him with alacrity! O\nBrihaspati, put him into subjection; O Agni and Soma, pierce him through!  \n3\\. Slay the offspring of the sorcerer, O soma-drinking (Indra), and subject\n(him)! Make drop out the farther and the nearer eye of the braggart (demon)!  \n4\\. Wherever, O Agni Gatavedas, thou perceivest the brood of these hidden\ndevourers (atrin), do thou, mightily strengthened by our charm, slay them:\nslay their (brood), O Agni, piercing them a hundredfold!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 16.
