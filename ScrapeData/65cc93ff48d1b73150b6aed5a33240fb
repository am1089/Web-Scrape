(Entity) does not spring from non-entity on account of that not being\nobserved.\n\nThe system of the Vaina _s_ ikas is objectionable for this reason also that\nthose who deny the existence of permanent stable causes are driven to maintain\nthat entity springs from non-entity. This latter tenet is expressly enunciated\nby the Bauddhas where they say, 'On, account of the manifestation (of effects)\nnot without previous destruction (of the cause).' For, they say, from the\ndecomposed seed only the young plant springs, spoilt milk only turns into\ncurds, and the lump of clay has ceased to be a lump when it becomes a jar. If\neffects did spring from the unchanged causes, all effects would originate from\nall causes at once,\n\np. 416\n\nas then no specification would be required 1. Hence, as we see that young\nplants, &c. spring from seeds, &c. only after the latter have been merged in\nnon-existence, we hold that entity springs from non-entity.\n\nTo this Bauddha tenet we reply, ('Entity does) not (spring) from non-entity,\non account of that not being observed.' If entity did spring from non-entity,\nthe assumption of special causes would be purportless, since non-entity is in\nall cases one and the same. For the non-existence of seeds and the like after\nthey have been destroyed is of the same kind as the non-existence of horns of\nhares and the like, i.e. non-existence is in all cases nothing else but the\nabsence of all character of reality, and hence there would be no sense (on the\ndoctrine of origination from non-existence) in assuming that sprouts are\nproduced from seeds only, curds from milk only, and so on. And if non-\ndistinguished non-existence were admitted to have causal efficiency, we should\nalso have to assume that sprouts, &c. originate from the horns of hares, &c.--\na thing certainly not actually observed.--If, again, it should be assumed that\nthere are different kinds of non-existence having special distinctions--just\nas, for instance, blueness and the like are special qualities of lotuses and\nso on--we point out that in that case the fact of there being such special\ndistinctions would turn the non-entities into entities no less real than\nlotuses and the like. In no case non-existence would possess causal\nefficiency, simply because, like the horn of a hare, it is non-existence\nmerely.--Further, if existence sprang from non-existence, all effects would be\naffected with non-existence; while as a matter of fact they are observed to be\nmerely positive entities distinguished by their various special\ncharacteristics. Nor 2 does any one\n\np. 417\n\nthink that things of the nature of clay, such as pots and the like, are the\neffects of threads and the like; but everybody knows that things of the nature\nof clay are the effects of clay only.--The Bauddha's tenet that nothing can\nbecome a cause as long as it remains unchanged, but has to that end to undergo\ndestruction, and that thus existence springs from non-existence only is false;\nfor it is observed that only things of permanent nature which are always\nrecognised as what they are, such as gold, &c., are the causes of effects such\nas golden ornaments, and so on. In those cases where a destruction of the\npeculiar nature of the cause is observed to take place, as in the case of\nseeds, for instance, we have to acknowledge as the cause of the subsequent\ncondition (i.e. the sprout) not the earlier condition in so far as it is\ndestroyed, but rather those permanent particles of the seed which are not\ndestroyed (when the seed as a whole undergoes decomposition).--Hence as we see\non the one hand that no entities ever originate from nonentities such as the\nhorns of a hare, and on the other hand that entities do originate from\nentities such as gold and the like the whole Bauddha doctrine of existence\nspringing from non-existence has to be rejected.--We finally point out that,\naccording to the Bauddhas, all mind and all mental modifications spring from\nthe four skandhas discussed above and all material aggregates from the atoms;\nwhy then do they stultify this their own doctrine by the fanciful assumption\nof entity springing from non-entity and thus needlessly perplex the mind of\nevery one?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[416:1](sbe34202.htm#fr_407) If the cause were able, without having undergone\nany change, to produce effects, it would at the same moment produce all the\neffects of which it is capable.--Cp. on this point the Sarvadar _s_ a _n_ asa\n_m_ graha.\n\n[416:2](sbe34202.htm#fr_408) This is added to obviate the remark that it is\nnot a general rule that effects are of the same nature as their causes, and\nthat therefore, after all, existent things may spring from non-existence.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 27](sbe34203.htm)\n\n"
