The root of the word is _vid_ , "to know;" hence the term _Veda_\nsignifies _knowledge;_ and as these books were not written for centuries after\nthey were originally composed, it signifies knowledge that was heard, or\norally communicated. The Vedas are not the work of a single person, but,\naccording to popular belief, were communicated to a number of Rishis or\nsaints, who in their turn transmitted them to their disciples. The Seer Vy\xc4\x81sa\nis styled the arranger, or, as we should now say, the editor, of these works.\n\nThe instruction contained in these writings is said to have been breathed\nforth by God Himself. Other writers teach that it issued from Him like smoke\nfrom fire. Sometimes the Vedas are said to have sprung from the\n\np. 4\n\nelements. The accounts of their origin, though differing in form, agree in\nteaching that they were the direct gift of God to man; and hence they are\nregarded with the greatest veneration. They are the special property of the\nBr\xc4\x81hmans. As early as Manu, the nominal author or compiler of a law book\nprobably not more than two or three centuries later than the Vedas, though\nsome suppose it to have been no earlier than A.D. 500, it was regarded as a\ngrave offence for a single word of these divinely given books to be heard by a\nman of a lower caste.\n\nThe Vedas are four in number; of these the Rig-Veda is the oldest, next in\norder was the Yajur-Veda, then the Sama-Veda, and last of all the Atharva-\nVeda. Each of these Vedas consists of two main parts: a Sanhita, or collection\nof mantras or hymns; and a Br\xc4\x81hmana, containing ritualistic precept and\nillustration, which stands in somewhat the same relation to the Sanhita as the\nTalmud to the Law. In these are found instructions to the priests who conduct\nthe worship of the gods addressed in. the hymns. Attached to each Br\xc4\x81hmana is\nan Upanishad, containing secret or mystical doctrine. These are regarded as of\nlesser authority than the Mantras and Br\xc4\x81hmanas. For whilst they are spoken of\nas _Sruti_ , _i.e._ heard, the Upanishads are _Smriti_ , learned. Though based\non the older compositions, if there is any discrepancy between them, the\nteaching of the later ones is rejected. The Sanhita and Br\xc4\x81hmana are for the\nBr\xc4\x81hmans generally; the Upanishads for philosophical inquirers. Yet, strange\nto say, whereas the older portions had, until recent years, been almost\nentirely neglected, with some parts of the Upanishads there was considerable\nacquaintance amongst the learned pundits of Benares and other places. In many\nparts\n\np. 5\n\nof India not a man could be found able to read and interpret them. Of the\nSanhitas, the "Rig-Veda Sanhita--containing one thousand and seventeen hymns--\nis by far the most important; whilst the Atharva-Veda-Sanhita, though\ngenerally held to be the most recent, is perhaps the most interesting.\nMoreover, these are the only two Vedic hymn-books worthy of being called\nseparate original collections;" * the others being almost entirely made up of\nextracts from the Rig-Veda. Between the time of the composition of the Rig-\nVeda and that of the Atharva, considerable changes in the religious faith of\nthe people had come about. The childlike trust of the earlier hymns has\ndisappeared, and the deities now seem more cruel, and there is greater need of\npropitiatory offerings. Probably the old religion of the people whom they had\nconquered had begun to tell on that of the Aryans.\n\nThe Sanhitas of three of the Vedas are said to have some peculiarity. "If a\nmantra is metrical, and intended for loud recitation, it is called _Rich_\n(from _rich_ , praise) whence the name Rig Veda; _i.e._ the Veda containing\nsuch praises. If it is prose (and then it must be muttered inaudibly), it is\ncalled _Yajus_ ( _yaj_ , sacrifice, hence, literally, the means by which\nsacrifice is effected); therefore Yajur-Veda signifies the Veda containing\nsuch _yajus_. And if it is metrical, and intended for chanting, it is called\n_S \xc4\x81man_ [equal]; hence S\xc4\x81man Veda means the Veda containing such _Samans_.\nThe author of the Mantra, or as the Hindus would say, the inspired \'Seer,\' who\nreceived it from the Deity, is termed its _Rishi;_ and the object with which\nit is concerned is its _devata_ --a word which generally means a \'deity,\' but\nthe meaning of which, in its reference to mantras, must not\n\np. 6\n\nalways be taken literally, as there are hymns in which not gods nor deified\nbeings, but, for instance, a sacrificial post, weapons, etc., invoked, are\nconsidered as the _devata_. * It should, however, be noticed that the deifying\nof a "sacrificial post" or a "weapon" is in perfect harmony with the general\npantheistic notions which prevailed amongst the people then as now: so that\nthere is nothing unnatural according to their religious ideas in speaking even\nof inanimate objects as deities. There is little doubt that the Br\xc4\x81hmanas are\nmore recent than the Sanhitas.\n\nThe Vedas have not come down to the present time without considerable dispute\nas to the text. As might have been expected, seeing that this teaching was\ngiven orally, discrepancies arose. One account mentions no less than twenty-\none versions (S\xc4\x81kh\xc4\x81s) of the Rig-Veda; another gives five of the Rig-Veda,\nforty-two of the Yajur-Veda, mentions twelve out of a thousand of the S\xc4\x81man-\nVeda, and twelve of the Atharva-Veda. And as each school believed that it\npossessed the true Veda, it anathematized those who taught and followed any\nother. The Rig-Veda Sanhita that has survived to the present age is that of\none school only, the S\xc4\x81kala; the Yajur-Veda is that of three schools; the\nS\xc4\x81ma-Veda is that of perhaps two, and the Atharva-Veda of one only.\n\n"The history of the Yajur-Veda differs in so far from that of the other Vedas,\nas it is marked by a dissension between its own schools far more important\nthan the differences which separated the school of each [of the] other Vedas.\nIt is known by the distinction between a Yajur-Veda called the Black--and\nanother called the White--Yajur-Veda. Tradition, especially that of the\n\np. 7\n\n[paragraph continues] Pur\xc4\x81nas, records a legend to account for it.\nVaisamp\xc4\x81yana, it says, a disciple of Vy\xc4\x81sa, who had received from him the\nYajur-Veda, having committed an offence, desired his disciples to assist him\nin the performance of some expiatory act. One of these, however, Y\xc4\x81jnavalkya,\nproposed that he should alone perform the whole rite; upon which Vaisamp\xc4\x81yana,\nenraged at what he considered to be the arrogance of his disciple, uttered a\ncurse on him, the effect of which was that Y\xc4\x81jnavalkya disgorged all the Yajus\ntexts he had learned from Vaisamp\xc4\x81yana. The other disciples, having been\nmeanwhile transformed into partridges ( _tittiri_ ), picked up these tainted\ntexts and retained them. Hence these texts are called Taittiriyas. But\nY\xc4\x81jnavalkya, desirous of obtaining Yajus texts, devoutly prayed to the Sun,\nand had granted to him his wish--\'to possess such texts as were not known to\nhis teacher.\'" * And thus there are two Yajur-Vedas to this day; the Black\nbeing considered the older of the two.\n\nAs to the date of the Vedas, there is nothing certainly known. There is no\ndoubt that they are amongst the oldest literary productions of the world. But\nwhen they were composed is largely a matter of conjecture. Colebrooke seems to\nshow from a Vaidick Calendar that they must have been written before the 14th\ncentury B.C. Some assign to them a more recent, some a more ancient, date. Dr.\nHaug considers the Vedic age to have extended from B.C. 2000 to B.C. 1200,\nthough he thinks some of the oldest hymns may have been composed . B.C. 2400.\nMax-Muller gives us the probable date of the Mantra, or hymn portion of the\nVedas, from B.C. 1200 to B.C. 800, and the Br\xc4\x81hmanas from B.C. 800 to B.C.\n600, and the rest from B.C. 600 to B.C. 200.\n\np. 8\n\nThere is nothing whatever in the books themselves to indicate when they were\n_written_. All references in them are to their being given orally, learned,\nand then again taught audibly to others. Probably for centuries after the art\nof writing was known in India it was not employed for preserving the sacred\nbooks, as in the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata those who _write_ the Vedas are threatened with\nthe punishment of hell.( 9 )\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[5:*](hmvp05.htm#fr_0) "Indian Wisdom," p. 9.\n\n[6:*](hmvp05.htm#fr_1) Goldstucker, art.
