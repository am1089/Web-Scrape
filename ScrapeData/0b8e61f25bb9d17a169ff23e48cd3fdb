And to that same (subtle body) that warmth (belongs), on account of the\nproof (which observation furnishes).\n\nTo that same subtle body belongs the warmth which we perceive in the living\nbody by means of touch. That warmth is not felt in the body after death, while\nsuch qualities as form, colour and so on continue to be perceived; it is on\nthe other hand, observed as long as there is life.
