The internal ruler over the devas and so on (is Brahman), because the\nattributes of that (Brahman) are designated.\n\nIn B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 1 ff. we read, 'He who within rules this world and the\nother world and all beings,' and later on, 'He who dwells in the earth and\nwithin the earth, whom\n\np. 131\n\nthe earth does not know, whose body the earth is, who rules the earth within,\nhe is thy Self, the ruler within, the immortal,' &c. The entire chapter (to\nsum up its contents) speaks of a being, called the antaryamin (the internal\nruler), who, dwelling within, rules with reference to the gods, the world, the\nVeda, the sacrifice, the beings, the Self.--Here now, owing to the unusualness\nof the term (antaryamin), there arises a doubt whether it denotes the Self of\nsome deity which presides over the gods and so on, or some Yogin who has\nacquired extraordinary powers, such as, for instance, the capability of making\nhis body subtle, or the highest Self, or some other being. What alternative\nthen does recommend itself?\n\nAs the term is an unknown one, the purvapakshin says, we must assume that the\nbeing denoted by it is also an unknown one, different from all those mentioned\nabove.--Or else it may be said that, on the one hand, we have no right to\nassume something of an altogether indefinite character, and that, on the other\nhand, the term antaryamin--which is derived from antaryamana (ruling\nwithin)--cannot be called altogether unknown, that therefore antaryamin may be\nassumed to denote some god presiding over the earth, and so on. Similarly, we\nread (B _ri_. Up. III, 9, 16), 'He whose dwelling is the earth, whose sight is\nfire, whose mind is light,' &c. A god of that kind is capable of ruling the\nearth, and so on, dwelling within them, because he is endowed with the organs\nof action; rulership is therefore rightly ascribed to him.--Or else the\nrulership spoken of may belong to some Yogin whom his extraordinary powers\nenable to enter within all things.--The highest Self, on the other hand,\ncannot be meant, as it does not possess the organs of action (which are\nrequired for ruling).\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--The internal ruler, of whom Scripture\nspeaks with reference to the gods, must be the highest Self, cannot be\nanything else.--Why so?--Because its qualities are designated in the passage\nunder discussion. The universal rulership implied in the statement that,\ndwelling within, it rules the entire aggregate of created beings, inclusive of\nthe gods, and so on, is an appropriate\n\np. 132\n\nattribute of the highest Self, since omnipotence depends on (the omnipotent\nruler) being the cause of all created things.--The qualities of Selfhood and\nimmortality also, which are mentioned in the passage, 'He is thy Self, the\nruler within, the immortal,' belong in their primary sense to the highest\nSelf.--Further, the passage, 'He whom the earth does not know,' which declares\nthat the internal ruler is not known by the earth-deity, shows him to be\ndifferent from that deity; for the deity of the earth knows itself to be the\nearth.--The attributes 'unseen,' 'unheard,' also point to the highest Self,\nwhich is devoid of shape and other sensible qualities.--The objection that the\nhighest Self is destitute of the organs of action, and hence cannot be a\nruler, is without force, because organs of action may be ascribed to him owing\nto the organs of action of those whom he rules,--If it should be objected that\n[if we once admit an internal ruler in addition to the individual soul] we are\ndriven to assume again another and another ruler ad infinitum; we reply that\nthis is not the case, as actually there is no other ruler (but the highest\nSelf 1). The objection would be valid only in the case of a difference of\nrulers actually existing.--For all these reasons, the internal ruler is no\nother but the highest Self.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[132:1](sbe34055.htm#fr_154) According to Scripture, Nira _n_ ku _s_ a _m_\nsarvaniyantritva _m_ _s_ rauta _m_ na _k_ a tadri _s_ e sarvaniyantari bhedo\nna _k_ anumana _m_ _s_ rutibhaditam uttish _th_ ati. \xc3\x82nanda Giri. Or else, as\nGo. \xc3\x82n. remarks, we may explain: as the highest Self is not really different\nfrom the individual soul.
