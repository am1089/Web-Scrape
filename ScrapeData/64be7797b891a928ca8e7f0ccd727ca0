'When the father (of creation) had produced by knowledge and penance\n(work) the seven kinds of food, one of his (foods) was common to all beings,\ntwo he assigned to the Devas, (1)\n\n'Three he made for himself, one he gave to the animals. In it all rests,\nwhatsoever breathes and breathes not. (2)\n\np. 92\n\n'Why then do these not perish, though they are always eaten? He who knows this\nimperishable one, he eats food with his face. (3)\n\n'He goes even to the Devas, he lives on strength.' (4)\n\n2\\. When it is said, that 'the father produced by knowledge and penance the\nseven kinds of food,' it is clear that (it was he who) did so. When it is\nsaid, that 'one of his (foods) was common,' then that is that common food of\nhis which is eaten. He who worships (eats) that (common food), is not removed\nfrom evil, for verily that food is mixed (property) 1. When it is said, that\n'two he assigned to the Devas,' that is the huta, which is sacrificed in fire,\nand the prahuta, which is given away at a sacrifice. But they also say, the\nnew-moon and full-moon sacrifices are here intended, and therefore one should\nnot offer them as an ish _t_ i or with a wish.\n\nWhen it is said, that 'one he gave to animals,' that is milk. For in the\nbeginning (in their infancy) both men and animals live on milk. And therefore\nthey either make a new-born child lick gh _ri_ ta (butter), or they make it\ntake the breast. And they call a new-born creature 'at _ri_ _n_ ada,' i.e. not\neating herbs. When it is said, that 'in it all rests, whatsoever breathes and\nbreathes not,' we see that all this, whatsoever breathes and breathes not,\nrests and depends on milk.\n\nAnd when it is said (in another Brahma _n_ a), that a man who sacrifices with\nmilk a whole year 2, overcomes death again, let him not think so. No, on\n\np. 93\n\nthe very day on which he sacrifices, on that day he overcomes death again; for\nhe who knows this, offers to the gods the entire food (viz. milk).\n\nWhen it is said, 'Why do these not perish, though they are always eaten,' we\nanswer, Verily, the Person is the imperishable, and he produces that food\nagain and again 1.\n\nWhen it is said, 'He who knows this imperishable one, I then, verily, the\nPerson is the imperishable one, for he produces this food by repeated thought,\nand whatever he does not work by his works, that perishes.\n\nWhen it is said, that 'he eats food with his face,' then face means the mouth,\nhe eats it with his mouth.\n\nWhen it is said, that 'he goes even to the Devas, he lives on strength,' that\nis meant as praise.\n\n3\\. When it is said, that 'he made three for himself,' that means that he made\nmind, speech, and breath for himself. As people say, 'My mind was elsewhere, I\ndid not see; my mind was elsewhere, I did not hear,' it is clear that a man\nsees with his mind and hears with his mind 2. Desire, representation, doubt,\nfaith, want of faith, memory 3, forgetfulness, shame, reflexion, fear, all\nthis is mind. Therefore even if a man is touched on the back, he knows it\nthrough the mind.\n\nWhatever sound there is, that is speech. Speech indeed is intended for an end\nor object, it is nothing by itself.\n\np. 94\n\nThe up-breathing, the down-breathing, the back-breathing, the out-breathing,\nthe on-breathing, all that is breathing is breath (pra _n_ a) only. Verily\nthat Self consists of it; that Self consists of speech, mind, and breath.\n\n4\\. These are the three worlds: earth is speech, sky mind, heaven breath.\n\n5\\. These are the three Vedas: the _Ri_ g-veda is speech, the Ya _g_ ur-veda\nmind, the Sama-veda breath.\n\n6\\. These are the Devas, Fathers, and men: the Devas are speech, the Fathers\nmind, men breath.\n\n7\\. These are father, mother, and child: the father is mind, the mother\nspeech, the child breath.\n\n8\\. These are what is known, what is to be known, and what is unknown.\n\nWhat is known, has the form of speech, for speech is known. Speech, having\nbecome this, protects man 1.\n\n9\\. What is to be known, has the form of mind, for mind is what is to be\nknown. Mind, having become this, protects man.\n\n10\\. What is unknown, has the form of breath, for breath is unknown. Breath,\nhaving become this, protects man 2.\n\n11\\. Of that speech (which is the food of Pra _g_ apati) earth is the body,\nlight the form, viz. this fire. And so far as speech extends, so far extends\nthe earth, so far extends fire.\n\n12\\. Next, of this mind heaven is the body, light the form, viz. this sun. And\nso far as this mind\n\np. 95\n\nextends, so far extends heaven, so far extends the sun. If they (fire and sun)\nembrace each other, then wind is born, and that is Indra, and he is without a,\nrival. Verily a second is a rival, and he who knows this, has no rival.\n\n13\\. Next, of this breath water is the body, light the form, viz. this moon.\nAnd so far as this breath extends, so far extends water, so far extends the\nmoon.\n\nThese are all alike, all endless. And he who worships them as finite, obtains\na finite world, but he who worships them as infinite, obtains an infinite\nworld.\n\n14\\. That Pra _g_ apati is the year, and he consists of sixteen digits. The\nnights 1 indeed are his fifteen digits, the fixed point 2 his sixteenth digit.\nHe is increased and decreased by the nights. Having on the new-moon night\nentered with the sixteenth part into everything that has life, he is thence\nborn again in the morning. Therefore let no one cut off the life of any living\nthing on that night, not even of a lizard, in honour (pu _g_ artham) of that\ndeity.\n\n15\\. Now verily that Pra _g_ apati, consisting of sixteen digits, who is the\nyear, is the same as a man who knows this. His wealth constitutes the fifteen\ndigits, his Self the sixteenth digit. He is increased and decreased by that\nwealth. His Self is the nave, his wealth the felly. Therefore even if he loses\neverything, if he lives but with his Self, people say, he lost the felly\n(which can be restored again).\n\n16\\. Next there are verily three worlds, the world of men, the world of the\nFathers, the world of the Devas. The world of men can be gained by a son\n\np. 96\n\nonly, not by any other work. By sacrifice the world of the Fathers, by\nknowledge the world of the Devas is gained. The world of the Devas is the best\nof worlds, therefore they praise knowledge.\n\n17\\. Next follows the handing over. When a man thinks he is going to depart,\nhe says to his son: 'Thou art Brahman (the Veda, so far as acquired by the\nfather); thou art the sacrifice (so far as performed by the father); thou art\nthe world.' The son answers: 'I am Brahman, I am the sacrifice, I am the\nworld.' Whatever has been learnt (by the father) that, taken as one, is\nBrahman. Whatever sacrifices there are, they, taken as one, are the sacrifice.\nWhatever worlds there are, they, taken as one, are the world. Verily here ends\nthis (what has to be done by a father, viz. study, sacrifice, &c.) 'He (the\nson), being all this, preserved me from this world 1,' thus he thinks.\nTherefore they call a son who is instructed (to do all this), a world-son\n(lokya), and therefore they instruct him.\n\nWhen a father who knows this, departs this world, then he enters into his son\ntogether with his own spirits (with speech, mind, and breath). If there is\nanything done amiss by the father, of all that the son delivers him, and\ntherefore he is called Putra, son 2. By help of his son the father stands firm\nin this world 3. Then these divine immortal spirits (speech, mind, and breath)\nenter into him.\n\np. 97\n\n18\\. From the earth and from fire, divine speech enters into him. And verily\nthat is divine speech whereby, whatever he says, comes to be.\n\n19\\. From heaven and the sun, divine mind enters into him. And verily that is\ndivine mind whereby he becomes joyful, and grieves no more.\n\n20\\. From water and the moon, divine breath (spirit) enters into him. And\nverily that is divine breath which, whether moving or not moving, does not\ntire, and therefore does not perish. He who knows this, becomes the Self of\nall beings. As that deity (Hira _n_ yagarbha) is, so does he become. And as\nall beings honour that deity (with sacrifice, &c.), so do all beings honour\nhim who knows this.\n\nWhatever grief these creatures suffer, that is all one 1 (and therefore\ndisappears). Only what is good approaches him; verily, evil does not approach\nthe Devas.\n\n21\\. Next follows the consideration of the observances 2 (acts). Pra _g_ apati\ncreated the actions (active senses). When they had been created, they strove\namong themselves. Voice held, I shall speak; the eye held, I shall see; the\near held, I shall hear; and thus the other actions too, each according to its\nown act. Death, having become weariness, took them and seized them. Having\nseized them, death held them back (from their work). Therefore speech grows\nweary, the eye grows weary, the ear grows weary. But death did not seize the\ncentral breath. Then the others tried to know him, and\n\np. 98\n\nsaid: 'Verily, he is the best of us, he who, whether moving or not, does not\ntire and does not perish. Well, let all of us assume his form.' Thereupon they\nall assumed his form, and therefore they are called after him 'breaths'\n(spirits).\n\nIn whatever family there is a man who knows this, they call that family after\nhis name. And he who strives with one who knows this, withers away and finally\ndies. So far with regard to the body.\n\n22\\. Now with regard to the deities.\n\nAgni (fire) held, I shall burn; \xc3\x82ditya (the sun) held, I shall warm; _K_\nandramas (the moon) held, I shall shine; and thus also the other deities, each\naccording to the deity. And as it was with the central breath among the\nbreaths, so it was with Vayu, the wind among those deities. The other deities\nfade, not Vayu. Vayu is the deity that never sets.\n\n23\\. And here there is this _S_ loka:\n\n'He from whom the sun rises, and into whom it sets' (he verily rises from the\nbreath, and sets in the breath)\n\n'Him the Devas made the law, he only is to-day, and he to-morrow also'\n(whatever these Devas determined then, that they perform to-day also 1).\n\nTherefore let a man perform one observance only, let him breathe up and let\nhim breathe down, that the evil death may not reach him. And when he performs\nit, let him try to finish it. Then he obtains through it union and oneness\nwith that deity (with pra _n_ a).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[91:2](sbe15056.htm#fr_296) Madhyandina text, p. 1054.\n\n[92:1](sbe15056.htm#fr_297) It belongs to all beings.\n\n[92:2](sbe15056.htm#fr_298) This would imply 360 sacrificial days, each with\ntwo oblations, i.e. 720 oblations.\n\n[93:1](sbe15056.htm#fr_299) Those who enjoy the food, become themselves\ncreators.
