Naraya _n_ a said :-- A part of Sarasvati descended in this Bharata Pu\n_n_ ya Bhumi (land of merits), owing to the curse of Ganga; and She remained\nin full in Vi _sn_ u's region, the abode of Vaiku _nt_ ha. She is named\nBharati, on account of Her coming to Bharata; she is called Brahmi because she\nis dear to Brahma; and She is called Vani as She presides over Speech. Hari is\nseen everywhere, in tanks, in wells, in running streams (i.e., in Saras).\nBecause He resides in Saras, therefore He is called Sarasvan. Vani is the\nS'akti of that Sarasvan; therefore She is denominated Sarasvati. The river\nSarasvati is a very sacred Tirtha. She is the burning fire to the fuel of\nsins, of sinners. O Narada! Through the curse of Sarasvati, the Devi Ganga\nalso assumed the form of a river in part. She was brought down to this earth\nat the request of Bhagiratha. Hence she is called Bhagirathi. While Ganga was\nrushing down to the earth S'iva capable to bear the great rush of Her, held\nHer on His head at the request of the Mother Earth. Lak _s_ mi also, through\nthe curse of Sarasvati came in part of parts Bharata as the river Padmavati.\nBut She remained in full with Hari. Lak _s_ mi appeared also in Her other part\nas the well-known daughter Tulasi of the king Dharmadhvaja in India. Last of\nall, through Bharati's curse and by the command of S'ri Hari, she turned into\nthe Tulasi tree, purifying the whole world. Remaining for five thousand years\nof Kali, all them will quit their river appearances and go back to Hari. By\nthe\n\n\n\np. 834\n\n\n\ncommand of S\xc2\x92ri Hari, all the Tirthas save Kasi and Bindraban will go along\nwith them to Vaiku _nt_ ha. Next at the expiry of the ten thousand years of\nKali, S'alagrama S'ila (the stone piece worshipped as Naraya _n_ a) S'iva, and\nS'iva S'akti and Puru _s_ ottama Jagannatha will leave the soil of Bharata and\ngo to their respective places, (i.e. the Mahatmyas of those will be extinct\nfrom Bharata). There will then cease to be the saints of S'iva S'akta, Ga _n_\napatya and Vai _sn_ ava sects, (eighteen) Pura _n_ as, the blowing of conch\nshells (auspicious signs), S'raddhas, Tarpa _n_ as, and all the rites and\nceremonies dictated by the Vedas. The worship and glorification of the Gods,\nthe recitation of their praises, their names will be extinct. The Vedas with\ntheir Amgas will no longer be heard of. All these will disappear with them.\nThe assembly of the Sadhus, the true Dharma, the four Vedas, the village Devas\nand Devis, the Vratas (vows) the practising of the austerities, fasting, all\nwill disappear. All will be addicted to the Vamachara ritual (the left-hand\nritual Tantrik form of worship; sarcastically used in the sense of drinking\nwine and eating flesh, etc.) They will speak falsehood and be deceitful. If\nanybody worships, his worship will be void of Tulasi leaves. Almost all will\nbe deceitful, cruel, vain, egoistic, thievish and mischievous. Men will be at\nvariance with one another; women will be at variance with one another; no fear\nwill exist in marriage ties. Properties will be only of those that will make\nthem (i. e. there will cease to be any inheritance from father to son and so\nforth ). Husbands will be obedient to their wives; unchaste women will be in\nevery house. Wives will rebuke their husbands by incessant noisings and\nchidings. Wives will be the sole mistresses of houses and husbands will stand\nbefore them as servants with folded palms. Fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law\nwill be their servants. The brothers of wives, and their friends will be the\nmanagers of the household affairs. But there will be no friendship with one's\nown class fellows. The brothers and friends of the house owners (masters of\nthe house) will appear quite strangers as if they are new-comers. Without the\ncommand of the house-wives, the masters of the houses will be unable to do\nanything. The divisions of caste (Brahma _n_ a, K _s_ attriya, Vai _s_ ya, and\nS'udra) will entirely disappear. Far from practising Sandhya Bandanam and\nother daily practices, the Brahma _n_ as will cease to hold the holy threads\neven on their bodies. The four colour-classes will practise the doings of the\nMlechchas, read the S'astras of the Mlechchas and forsake their own S'astras.\nThe Brahmi _n_ s, K _s_ attriyas, and Vais'yas will become the slaves of\nS'udras, will become their cooks, runners and carriers of buffaloes. Every one\nwill be devoid of truth. Earth will not yield any grains;\n\n\n\np. 835\n\n\n\ntrees will not yield any fruits and women will be issueless. The cows will not\nyield milk; even if there be a little milk, ghee will not come out of it. The\naffection between husband and wife will die out and the families will be\ndevoid of truth. The King will not wield any power; the subjects will be over\nburdened with taxes. The ever flowing big rivers, the petty streams, the caves\nof mountains all will gradually have very little water in them. The Four Var\n_n_ as will be devoid of Dharma and Pu _n_ ya (merit, virtue). One in a lakh\nmay be virtuous. Afterwards that too will cease. Men, women, boys, all will be\nugly and deformed. They will utter bad words and vile sounds. Some villages\nand towns will be completely deserted by men and will look terrible; at some\nothers few cottages with few inhabitants will be seen. Villages and towns will\nbe jungles and jungles will become filled with men. The inhabitants of the\nforests will become heavily taxed and disconsolate. The beds of rivers and\nlakes will become dry owing to want of rains and will be cultivated. The\nKulinas of high families will become very low. The whole earth will be filled\nwith liars, untruthful cheats and hypocrites. The lands, though cultivated\nwell, will yield grains in name. Those who are well known as the millionaires,\nthey will become poor and those who are devoted to the Devas will be atheists.\nThe towns folk will have no trace of mercy; rather they will hate and envy\ntheir neighbours and turn out murderers of men. In the Kali age, males and\nfemales will be everywhere, of a dwarfish stature, diseased, shortlived, and\nof very little youthful virility. The hairs will turn out grey no sooner the\npeople reach their sixteenth year. And they will be very old when they become\ntwenty years old. The girls of eight years will have menstruation and will\nbecome pregnant. They will deliver every year. Old age will attack them when\nthey become sixteen years old. Some women will have their husbands and\nchildren living. Otherwise almost all will be barren, childless. The four Var\n_n_ as will sell their daughters. The paramours of the mothers, wives, son's\nwives, daughters, and sisters will be the source of support to them all. No\none will be able, without money, to collect the merits by repeating the name\nof Hari. Persons will make gifts for name and fame and ultimately will take\nback what they had made as gifts. If there be any gifts made by one's own self\nor by one's forefathers or for a Deva purpose or for Brahmi _n_ s or for the\nfamilies of the Gurus, there will not be found wanting attempts to take back\nthose gifts. Some will go to daughters, some to mothers-in-law, some to the\nwives of sons, some to sisters, some to mothers of co-wives, some will go to\nthe brother's wives. In every house, those who are unfit to be mixed will be\nmixed with, excepting one's mother. In Kali Yuga\n\n\n\np. 836\n\n\n\nwho is whose wife? And who is whose husband? There will be no certainty; who\nis whose subject and what village is to whom? There will be no surety that\nsuch a property belongs to such and such a man. All will turn out to be liars,\nlicentious, thieves, envious of other's wives, and murderers of men. In the\nhouses of the Brahmi _n_ s, K _s_ attriyas, and Vais'yas, the three higher\ncastes, the current of sin will flow. They will live by selling lac, iron, and\nsalts prohibited by the S'astras. The Brahmi _n_ s will drive buffaloes, burn\nthe dead bodies of the S'udras, eat the food of the S'udras and go to unchaste\nwomen. There will be no more faith existing in the five Ri _s_ i Yaj\xc3\xb1as.\nAlmost every Brahmi _n_ will not observe the vows of Amavasya Nis'ipalana. The\nholy threads will be cast away and the Sandhya Bandanam and cleanliness and\ngood practices will cease altogether. The unchaste women who deal in giving\nloans, etc., and live on interests and the procuresses during menstruation\nwill cook in Brahmi _n_ families. There will be no distinction of food, no\ndistinction of wombs, no distinction of \xc3\x82s'ramas, and no distinction of\npersons. All will turn out Mlechchas. O Narada! Thus, when the Kali will have\nits full play, the whole world will be filled with Mlechchas, the trees will\nbe one hand high and the men will be of the size of a thumb. Then the most\npowerful Bhagavan Naraya _n_ a will incarnate in His part in the house of a\nBrahmi _n_ named Vi _sn_ ujas'a as his son. Mounted on a long horse, holding a\nlong sword He will make the world free of the Mlechchas in three nights. Then\nhe will disappear from the face of the Earth and She will be without any\nsovereign and be filled with robbers. There will be incessant rain, for six\nnights and it will rain and rain and the whole earth will be deluged; no\ntraces of men, houses, and trees. After this the Twelve Suns will rise\nsimultaneously and by their rays the whole water will be dried up and the\nearth will become level. Thus the dreadful Kali will pass away when the Satya\nYuga will come back, Tapasya and the true religion and Sattva Gu _n_ a will\nprevail again. The Brahmi _n_ s will practise Tapasya, they will be devoted to\nDharma and the Vedas. The women will be chaste and religious in every house.\nAgain the wise and intelligent K _s_ attriyas devoted to the Brahma _n_ as\nwill occupy the royal thrones and their might, devotion to Dharma and love for\ngood deeds will increase. The Vais'yas will again go on with their trades and\ntheir devotion to their trade and the Brahmi _n_ s will be reestablished. The\nS'udras, too, will be again virtuous, and serve the Brahmi _n_ s. Again the\nBrahmi _n_ s, K _s_ attriyas, and Vais'yas and their families will have Bhakti\ntowards the Devi, be initiated in Devi Mantras and all will meditate on the\nDevi. Again there will be spread the knowledge of the Vedas, the Smritis,\n\n\n\np. 837\n\n\n\nand the Pura _n_ as, all will go to their wives in menstruation periods. No\nAdharma (unrighteousness) will exist and the Dharma will reign in full, with\nall the parts (Kalas) complete. When the Treta Yuga comes, the Dharma will be\nthree footed; when the Dvapara Yuga will come; the Dharma will be two-footed\nand when Kali will begin, the Dharma will be one-footed, and when Kali will\nreign supreme, no Dharma will exist, even in name. (O Narada! Now I will speak\nof time.) The seven days of the week, Sunday, &c., the sixteen tithis,\nPratipada &c., the twelve months Vais'akha &c., the six seasons Summer, &c.,\nthe two fortnights (dark and bright) and the two Aya _n_ as (Northern and\nSouthern) are rendered in vogue. One day consists of four Praharas, one night\nconsists of four Praharas; a day and a night constitute one so-called day.\nThirty such days make one month. In the computation of time, five kinds of\nyears (Var _s_ as) were already mentioned (in the 8th Skandha). As the Satya,\nTreta, Dvapara and Kali roll on turn by turn, so the days, months and years\nalso roll on in turn. One day, according to the Devas, is equal to one year,\naccording to men; three hundred and sixty human Yugas equal to one Deva Yuga.\nSeventy-one Deva Yugas make one Manvantara. The life period of Indra, the Lord\nof S'achi, is one Manvantara. Twenty-eight Indras' lives equal to one day of\nHira _n_ yagarbha (the golden wombed) Brahma. One hundred and eight such years\nequal to the life of one Brahma. When this Brahma dies, there is the Prakrita\nPralaya. The earth is not visible then. (The dissolution of Prakriti takes\nplace.) The whole Brahma _nd_ a is deluged by water; Brahma, Vi _sn_ u,\nMahes'vara and the other wise Ri _s_ is get diluted in Para Brahma whose\nsubstance is all truth and consciousness. That time, the Prakriti Devi, too,\ngets merged in Para Brahma. The fall of Brahma and the dissolution of Prakriti\nare called the Prakrita Pralaya. The duration of this Pralaya is one Nime _s_\na of the Para Brahma Mula Prakriti united with Maya. All the Brahma _nd_ as\n(universes) are destroyed at this time. When this Nime _s_ a expires, the\ncreation begins again in due order. So one cannot count the endless numbers of\ntimes when this creation and dissolution work are going on. So who can tell\nhow many kalpas had past away, or how many Kalpas will come, how many Brahma\n_nd_ as were created or how many Brahma _nd_ as will be created. Who will be\nable to count how many Brahmas, how many Vi _sn_ us or how many Mahes'varas\nthere have been. But One and Only One Para Brahma Parames'vara (the Great God)\nis The Supreme Lord of these countless Brahma _nd_ as. The Parames'vara of the\nnature of Existence, Consciousness and Bliss is the Highest Spirit of all. All\nothers, Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes'vara the\n\n\n\np. 838\n\n\n\nGreat Vira _t_ , the Smaller Vira _t_ , all are His parts. This Brahma is Mula\nPrakriti and from That has appeared S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Lord of his left half\nwhich is woman (Ardha Naris'vara). It is She that divided Herself into two\nforms; in Her one form, She resides as the two armed Kri _sn_ a in the region\nof Goloka; and as the four-armed Naraya _n_ a in Vaiku _nt_ ha. All the things\nfrom Brahma, the Highest, to the mere grass the lowest, all are originated\nfrom Prakriti. And all the Prakriti-born things are transient. Thus the True,\nEternal Para Brahma, beyond the three gu _n_ as, the Source of all creation,\nWhose substance is All-Will is the Only Substance beyond the region of\nPrakriti. He is without Upadhis (conditions, as time, space, causation and\nattributes); He is without any form; and the forms that He assumes, they are\nfor shewing His Grace to the devotees only. The Lotus-born Brahma is able by\nHis Power of Knowledge to create the Brahma _nd_ a. It is by His Grace that\nS'iva, the Lord of the yogis is named Mrityumjaya (the Conqueror of Death),\nthe Destoyer of all, and the Knower of all Tattvas. By His Tapas, S'iva has\nrealised Para Brahma and therefore has become the Lord of all, All-knowing,\nendowed with great Vibhutis (lordly powers), the seer of all, omnipresent, the\nprotector of all, the bestower of all prosperities. The devotion and service\ntowards Para Brahma have alone made S\xc2\x92ri Vi _sn_ u the Lord of all; and it is\nthrough the power of Para Brahma, that Mahamaya Prakriti Devi has become\nomnipotent and the Goddess of all. Bhagavati Durga has got His Grace by Her\ndevotion and service to Him and has become Mula Prakriti of the nature of\nBeing, Consciousness and Bliss. And so has the Devi Savitri, the Mother of the\nVedas, become the presiding Deity of the Vedas and She is worshipped by the\nBrahma _n_ as and the Knowers of the Vedas. That She presides over all the\nbranches of knowledge, is worshipped by all the learned assemblies and by the\nwhole Universe is the result only of worshipping the Prakriti Devi. That Lak\n_s_ mi has become the bestower of all wealth and the presiding Deity of all\nthe villages and the mistress of all, worshipped by all and the bestower of\nsons to all is also the result of worshipping Her. Thus it is through the\nworship of Prakriti that Durga, the Destroyer of all calamities and troubles\nhas appeared from the left side of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a; and Radha has become the\npresiding Deity of His Pra _n_ a (vital airs), and She is worshipped by all\nand possessed of all knowledge. It is by the worship of S'akti that Radhika\nhas so much excelled in love, has become the presiding Deity of the pra _n_ a\nof Kri _sn_ a, has got love and respect, has been placed on His breast and is\nexceedingly beautiful. With the object of getting Kri _sn_ a for her husband,\nShe\n\n\n\np. 839\n\n\n\npractised severe austerities for one thousand Deva years on the mountain\nS'atas' _r_ inga in Bharata to get the Mula Prakriti's Grace. And when the\nS'akti Mula Prakriti became graciously pleased towards Her, S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a\nseeing Radhika increasing in beauty like the Crescent Moon took Her to His\nbreast and out of tenderness wept and granted Her highest boons so very rare\nto others and said :-- O Beautiful One! You better remain always in My breast\nand devoted to Me amongs all my wives; let you be superior to them all in good\nfortune, respect, love and glory. From today you are my greatest best wife. I\nwill love you as the best amongst them all. O Dear! Always I will be\nsubmissive to you and fulfil what you say. Thus saying, S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a\nselected her as his wife without any co-wives and made Her dear to His Heart.\nThe other Devis besides the five Prakritis, already mentioned, also derived\nsuperiorities by serving Mula Prakriti. O Muni! What shall I say, everyone\nreaps the fruits as he practises Tapasya. Bhagavati Durga practised on the\nHimalyas tapasya for one thousand Deva years and meditated on the lotus-feet\nof Mula Prakriti and so has come to be worshipped by all. The Devi Sarasvati\npractised Tapasya for one lakh Deva years and is come to be respected by all.\nThe Devi Lak _s_ mi practised Tapasya at Pu _s_ kara for one hundred Divine\nYugas and, by the Grace of Mula Prakriti has become the bestower of wealth to\nall. The Devi Savitri worshipped S\xc2\x92akti for sixty thousand divine years in the\nMalaya mountain and is respected and worshipped by all. O Bibhu! Brahma, Vi\n_sn_ u, and Mahes'vara worshipped S'akti for one hundred Manvantaras and so\nhave become the Preservers, etc., of this world. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a practised for\nten Manvantaras terrible austerities and therefore obtained his position in\nthe region of Goloka and is remaining there today in greatest bliss. Dharma\nDeva worshipped S\xc2\x92akti with devotion for ten Manvantaras and has become the\nlives of all, worshipped by all, and the receptacle of all. O Muni! Thus all,\nwhether the Devis, Devas, Munis, Kings, Brahma _n_ as, all have got their\nrespect in this world by the worship of S\xc2\x92akti. O Devar _s_ i! I have thus\ndescribed to you all that I heard from the mouth of my Guru, in accordance\nwith the rules of the Vedas. What more do you want to hear?\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the Greatness of Kali in the\nMaha Pura _n_ am Srimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 9](bk09ch09.htm)\n\n"
