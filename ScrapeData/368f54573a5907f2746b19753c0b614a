Narada said :-- Father! You have described to me the characteristic of\nthe three qualities; though I have drunk the sweet juice from your lotus like\nmouth, still I am not quite satisfied. Kindly describe to me, in detail, in\ndue order, how I can recognise clearly the three qualities so that I can get\nthe highest peace of mind.\n\n\n\np. 150\n\n\n\n3\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Creator of the world, Brahma, originated from\nthe Rajo Gu _n_ a, asked by his high minded son Narada, began to speak in the\nfollowing terms.\n\n\n\n4\\. O Narada! I myself do not possess fully the complete knowledge of the\nthree qualities; but, as far as I know, I am telling that to you.\n\n\n\n5\\. The pure Sattva quality is not found alone to exist anywhere; it manifests\nitself always, in mixed condition, in combination with the other qualities.\n\n\n\n6-9. As a beautiful woman, well decorated with ornaments and endowed with\namorous gestures, gives delight, on the one hand, to her husband, father,\nmother and friends; and, on the other hand, becomes a source of pain and\ndelusion to her rival wives, so the Sattva quality, personified as a beautiful\nwoman, engenders the Sattvic happiness of the mind to some individual, at one\ntime, and at another time becomes a source of pain to the same individual (or\nat one and the same time becomes a source of happiness to one and a source of\npain to another.) Thus the Rajas or the Tamas quality, personified\nrespectively as a beautiful woman becomes a source of pain or delusion to an\nindividual at one time, and at another time, a source of happiness to the same\nman. So it is easily seen that one quality cannot remain single; it remains in\nunion with the other qualities.\n\n\n\nNote :-- It is very possible that a man, possessing the Sattvic quality at any\ntime, can be said not to possess only the Sattvic quality but also the Rajas\nand the Tamas to a certain degree. At any subsequent time the Rajas might get\npreponderance, and that man may be in circumstances requiring money or so\nforth; but, due to his Sattva quality before hand he did not collect money and\ntherefore he feels pain afterwards. So with the Rajas. Or it may be thus :--\nSuppose an earning member is Sattvic. He earns just sufficient to meet his\nwants. But his family members require more money, for they are Rajasic.\nTherefore the earning member is happy for his Sattvic quality; but the other\nmembers are unhappy for his Sattvic quality. A man is, as it were, wedded to\nthe three wives, Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.\n\n\n\n10\\. O Narada! When the three qualities remain each in their own real natures,\nthen the effects produced by them also remain always the same; no changes are\nperceived owing to the difference of time or person. But when they get\ncombined, then each of them produces effects sometimes counter to their\nnatures.\n\n\n\n11-13. A young beautiful woman, shy, modest and of sweet qualities, well\nversed in her religious learning, and full of good behaviour, skilled in love\npractices and full of sweet sentiments becomes a source of loving delight\n\n\n\np. 151\n\n\n\nto her beloved and also a source of pain to her rival wives so each of the\nthree qualities assume no doubt, different aspects according to differences in\ntime and in the nature of the person.\n\n\n\nO Narada! As one woman gives pain and delusion to her rival wives and gives\npleasure to her husband and friends, so the Sattva quality, when perverted,\ngives pain and delusion to the persons.\n\n\n\n14-19. As the police sepoys and constables are, on the one hand, delight to\nthe saints, troubled by thieves, and, on the other hand, sources of pain and\nconfusion to the thieves and robbers; again as the heavy shower of rain in a\npitch dark night, in the rainy season, when the sky over clouded, and when\nthere are flashes of lightning and thunder, is on the one hand, a source of\nhighest delight to a farmer, who has all seeds and necessary things and\nimplements, and, on the other hand is a source of pain to the unfortunate\nhouseholder, whose house is not yet completely thatched with grass or who has\nnot been able to collect his beams and grass for necessary roofing, and a\nsource of utter bewildering confusion to the young woman, whose husband is\nabroad expected back at that time, so the three Gu _n_ as produce contrary\nresults when perverted by contact with the remaining Gu _n_ as, instead what\nthey would have produced, had they not been perverted so.\n\n\n\n20-25. O Child! Again I speak to you of the characteristics of the the Gu _n_\nas. The Sattva gu _n_ a is pure, clear, illumining, light (not heavy) white.\nWhen the senses, eyes, etc., and the limbs are felt very light (without any\nheaviness) and the heart and brain clear, when there is dispassion towards the\nRajasic and the Tamasic enjoyments, know then that the Sattva quality has\ngrown in preponderance in a body. When there is a tendency to yawn, when there\nis rigidity and suppression of the functions of faculties and when one feels\ndrowsiness, consider that the Rajasic quality has gone to excess. Again, when\none seeks after quarrels and goes to another village, one is always restless\nand ready to fight, when one feels heaviness in body, as if wrapped by a very\nheavy darkness, when one's limbs and senses are heavy and obscure, when one's\nmind is vacant, and when one does not like to go to sleep, know that the Tamas\nhas increased too much, Narada!\n\n\n\n26\\. Narada said :-- O Father! You have described the different\ncharacteristics of the three Gu _n_ as; but I cannot understand how they act\nall in conjunction?\n\n\n\n27\\. As those who are enemies to one another do not work united, so these Gu\n_n_ as, of opposite characteristics, are enemies, as it were, to one another;\nhow can, then, they act in unison? Kindly explain this to me.\n\n\n\np. 152\n\n\n\n28-30. Brahma said :-- O Narada! The three Gu _n_ as may be likened to a lamp.\nAs a lamp manifests a certain object, so these three qualities united do\nmanifest or reveal a certain thing. See the wick, oil, and flame are all of\ndifferent characteristics; though the oil goes against fire, still it unites\nwith the fire. The oil, wick and fire though running against each other, all\nthese united, serve the one common purpose of illumining, revealing a certain\nobject.\n\n\n\n31\\. So, O Narada! All the three qualities, though of contrary natures, go to\nprove the same thing.\n\n\n\nNarada said :-- O Son of Satyavati! The lotus born Brahma thus described the\nthree qualities, as born of Prakriti; and they are the causes of this\nUniverse. What I heard of you about the nature of Prakriti, I have now\ndescribed before you.\n\n\n\n32\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! What you asked me, I asked before the same to\nNarada and he described thus (as I told you above) to me about the\ncharacteristics and the effects of the three Gu _n_ as in regular order and in\ndetail.\n\n\n\n33\\. O King! Wherever in the S\xc2\x92astras whatever is said, the essence of all\nthat is this -- that the Highest Energy, the Supreme Force, the Great Goddess\nwho is pervading the Universe, is always with qualities and without qualities,\naccording to the differences in the manifestation. This Supreme Force is to be\nworshipped with the highest devotion.\n\n\n\n34\\. The Brahman, the Puru _s_ a (the Supporter, the Ultimate Substratum) the\nHighest Energy considered as the Male Principle though It is Undecaying,\nSupreme and Full, is still without any desires or emotions. It is not able to\naccomplish any action (without the help of its inherent force); this Mahamaya,\nthe Supreme Force is doing all the functions, real and unreal, of the\nuniverse.\n\n\n\n35-37. Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Rudra, the Sun, Moon, Indra, the twin Asvins, the\nVasus, Visvakarma, Kuvera, Varu _n_ a, Fire, Air, Pusa, the Sadanan, and Gane\n_s_ a all are united with S\xc2\x92akti and can do their respective functions; else\nthey are unable to move themselves. Therefore O king! Know that Supreme\nGoddess Mahamaya as the cause of this Universe.\n\n\n\n38\\. O Lord of men! You worship this Goddess, perform sacrifices in honour of\nHer and worship Her with the highest devotion.\n\n\n\n39\\. O king! That Mahamaya is Maha Lak _s_ mi, She is Maha Kali, She is Maha\nSarasvati; She is the Goddess of all the bhutas and She is the Cause of all\ncauses.\n\n\n\n40\\. That all peaceful, easily worshipped and the ocean of mercy, when\n\n\n\np. 153\n\n\n\nworshipped, fulfills all the desires of Her devotees; what to say, the mere\nutterance of Her name is sufficient for the granting of the desires.\n\n\n\n41\\. In days of yore Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes'vara and all the Devas and many\nother self controlled ascetics worshipped Her to attain liberation.\n\n\n\n42\\. O king! What shall I speak now about Her more than this :-- If one takes\nHer name even with indistinctness, She grants the desired purposes, even if\nthey are quite unattainable.\n\n\n\n43\\. In the midst of forest, on the sight of tigers and other ferocious\nanimals, if one becoming afraid, cries aloud Her seed mantra (twice) \xc2\x93Ai, Ai\xc2\x94\nwithout the Vindu (incorrectly) instead of \xc2\x93Aim, Aim\xc2\x94 She grants immediately\nhis desires.\n\n\n\n44-45. O best of kings! There is an example of Satyavrata on this point. That\nthe mere utterance of the name of Bhagavati gives unforeseen results, has been\nwitnessed by us and other high minded Munis. Also in the assembly of the\nBramanas I have heard fully many sages quoting in detail many instances on the\nabove point.\n\n\n\n46-47. O king! There was a Brahman, named Satyavrata, quite illiterate, a\nthorough block-head. Once he heard the letter \xc2\x93Ai, Ai\xc2\x94 being uttered by a pig;\nand in course of a talk he himself uttered incidentally that letter and\nthereby became the one of the best Pundits.\n\n\n\nN. B. \xc2\x96 \xc2\x93Aim\xc2\x94 is the seed mantra of Sarasvati, the Goddess of learning.\n\n\n\n48\\. The Goddess Devi, the Ocean of mercy, hearing the letter \xc2\x93Ai\xc2\x94 being\npronounced by that Brahmi _n_ , became very glad and made him the best of the\npoets.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Ninth Chapter of the 3rd Skandha on the characteristics of the\nGu _n_ as in S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 10](bk03ch10.htm)\n\n"
