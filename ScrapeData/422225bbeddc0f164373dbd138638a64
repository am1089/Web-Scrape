X.\n\nThe descendants of the daughters of Daksha married to the Rishis.\n\nMAITREYA.--Thou hast narrated to me, great Muni, all that I asked of thee: now\nresume the account of the creation subsequently to Bhrigu.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Lakshmi, the bride of Vishn\xcc\x81u, was the daughter of Bhrigu by\nKhyati. They had also two sons, Dhatri and Vidhatri, who married the two\ndaughters of the illustrious Meru, \xc3\x81yati and Niryati; and had by them each a\nson, named Pran\xcc\x81a and Mrikan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a. The son of the latter was Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, from\nwhom Veda\xc5\x9biras was born 1. The son of Pran\xcc\x81a was named Dyutimat, and his son\nwas Rajavat; after whom, the race of Bhrigu became infinitely multiplied.\n\nSambhuti, the wife of Marichi, gave birth to Paurnamasa, whose sons were\nVirajas and Sarvaga. I shall hereafter notice his other descendants, when I\ngive a more particular account of the race of Marichi 2.\n\nThe wife of Angiras, Smriti, bore daughters named Sinivali, Kuhu,\n\np. 83\n\n[paragraph continues] Raka, and Anumati (phases of the moon 3). Anasuya, the\nwife of Atri, was the mother of three sinless sons, Soma (the moon), Durvasas,\nand the ascetic Dattatreya 4. Pulastya had, by Priti, a son called in a former\nbirth, or in the Swayambhuva Manwantara, Dattoli, who is now known as the sage\nAgastya 5. Kshama, the wife of the patriarch Pulaha, was the mother of three\nsons, Karmasa, Arvarivat, and Sahishn\xcc\x81u 6. The wife of Kratu, Sannati, brought\nforth the sixty thousand Balakhilyas, pigmy sages, no bigger than a joint of\nthe thumb, chaste, pious, resplendent as the rays of the sun 7. Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha had\nseven sons by his wife Urjja, Rajas, Gatra, \xc3\x9arddhabahu, Savana, Anagha,\nSutapas, and \xc5\x9aukra, the seven pure sages 8. The Agni named Abhimani, who is\nthe eldest born of\n\np. 84\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahma, had, by Swaha, three sons of surpassing\nbrilliancy, Pavaka, Pavamana, and \xc5\x9auchi, who drinks up water: they had forty-\nfive sons, who, with the original son of Brahma and his three descendants,\nconstitute the forty-nine fires 9. The progenitors (Pitris), who, as I have\nmentioned, were created by Brahma, were the Agnishwattas and Varhishads; the\nformer being devoid of, and the latter possessed of, fires 10. By them, Swadha\nhad two daughters, Mena and Dharani, who were both acquainted with theological\ntruth, and both addicted to religious meditation; both accomplished in perfect\nwisdom, and adorned with all estimable qualities 11. Thus has been explained\nthe progeny of the\n\np. 85\n\ndaughters of Daksha 12. He who with faith recapitulates the account, shall\nnever want offspring.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[82:1](vp045.htm#fr_240) The commentator interprets the text ### to refer to\nPran\xcc\x81a: 'Veda\xc5\x9biras was born the son of Pran\xcc\x81a.' So the Bhagavata has ###. The\nLinga, the Vayu, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, however, confirm our reading of the text,\nmaking Veda\xc5\x9biras the son of Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya. Pran\xcc\x81a, or, as read in the two\nformer, Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u, was married to Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81arika, and had by her Dyutimat, whose\nsons were Srijavan\xcc\x81a and Asruta or Asrutavran\xcc\x81a. Mrikan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a (also read\nMrikan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u) married Manaswini, and had Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, whose son, by Murddhanya,\nwas Veda\xc5\x9biras: he married Pivari, and had many children, who constituted the\nfamily, or Brahmanical tribe, of Bhargavas, sons of Bhrigu. The most\ncelebrated of these was U\xc5\x9banas, the preceptor of the Daityas, who, according\nto the Bhagavata, was the son of Veda\xc5\x9biras; but the Vayu makes him the son of\nBhrigu by Paulomi, and born at a different period.\n\n[82:2](vp045.htm#fr_241) Alluding especially to Ka\xc5\x9byapa, the son of Marichi,\nof whose posterity a full detail is subsequently given. The Bhagavata adds a\ndaughter, Devakulya; and the Vayu and Linga, four daughters, Tusht\xcc\x81i, Pusht\xcc\x81i,\nTwisha, and Apachiti. The latter inserts the grandsons of Paurnamasa. Virajas,\nmarried to Gauri, has Sudhaman, a Lokapala, or ruler of the east quarter; and\nParvasa (quasi Sarvaga) has, by Parvasi, Yajnavama and Ka\xc5\x9byata, who were both\nfounders of Gotras, or families. The names of all these occur in different\nforms in different MSS.\n\n[83:3](vp045.htm#fr_242) The Bhagavata adds, that in the Swarochisha\nManwantara the sages Uttathya and Vrihaspati were also sons of Angiras; and\nthe Vayu, &c. specify Agni and Kirttimat as the sons of the patriarch in the\nfirst Manwantara. Agni, married to Sadwati, has Parjanya, married to Marichi;\nand their son is Hiranyaroman, a Lokapala. Kirttimat has, by Dhenuka, two\nsons, Charishn\xcc\x81u and Dhritimat.\n\n[83:4](vp045.htm#fr_243) The Bhagavata gives an account of Atri's penance, by\nwhich the three gods, Brahma, Vishn\xcc\x81u, and \xc5\x9aiva, were propitiated, and became,\nin portions of themselves, severally his sons, Soma, Datta, and Durvasas. The\nVayu has a totally different series, or five sons, Satyanetra, Havya,\n\xc3\x81pomurtti, Sani, and Soma; and one daughter, Sruti, who became the wife of\nKardama.\n\n[83:5](vp045.htm#fr_244) The text would seem to imply that he was called\nAgastya in a former Manwantara, but the commentator explains it as above. The\nBhagavata calls the wife of Pulastya, Havirbhu, whose sons were the Muni\nAgastya, called in a former birth Dahragni or Jat\xcc\x81haragni, and Visravas. The\nlatter had by Ilavila, the deity of wealth, Kuvera; and by Kesini, the\nRakshasas Ravan\xcc\x81a, Kumbhakarn\xcc\x81a, and Vibhishan\xcc\x81a. The Vayu specifies three\nsons of Pulastya, Dattoli, Vedabahu, and Vinita; and one daughter, Sadwati,\nmarried (see note 3) to Agni.\n\n[83:6](vp045.htm#fr_245) The Bhagavata reads Karma\xc5\x9bresht\xcc\x81ha, Variyas, and\nSahishn\xcc\x81u. The Vayu and Linga have Kardama and Ambarisha in place of the two\nfirst, and add Vanakapivat and a daughter, Pivari, married to Veda\xc5\x9biras (see\nnote 1). Kardama married \xc5\x9aruti (note 4), and had by her Sankhapada, one of the\nLokapalas, and a daughter, Kamya, married to Priyavrata (note\n[6](vp041.htm#fn_204), [p. 53](vp041.htm#page_53)). Vana-kapivat, also read\nDhana-k. and Ghana-k., had a son, Sahishn\xcc\x81u, married to Yasodhara, and they\nwere the parents of Kamadeva.\n\n[83:7](vp045.htm#fr_246) The different authorities agree in this place. The\nVayu adds two daughters, Punya and Sumati, married to Yajnavama (see note 2).\n\n[83:8](vp045.htm#fr_247) The Bhagavata has an entirely different set of names,\nor Chitraketu, Surochish, Virajas, Mitra, Ulwana, Vasubhridyana, and p. 84\nDyumat. It also specifies Saktri and others, as the issue of a different\nmarriage. The Vayu and Linga have the same sons as in our text, reading Putra\nand Hasta in place of Gatra: they add a daughter, Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81arika, married to\nPan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u (see note 1). The eldest son, according to the Vayu, espoused a\ndaughter of Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, and had by her the Lokapala of the west, Ketumat.\nThe seven sons of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha are termed in the text the seven Rishis,\nappearing in that character in the third Manwantara.\n\n[84:9](vp045.htm#fr_248) The eldest son of Brahma, according to the\ncommentator, upon the authority of the Vedas. The Vayu P. enters into a very\nlong detail of the names and places of the whole forty-nine fires. According\nto that, also, Pavaka is electric or Vaidynta fire; Pavamana is that produced\nby friction, or Nirmathya; and \xc5\x9auchi is solar, Saura, fire. Pavamana was the\nparent of Kavyavahana, the fire of the Pitris; \xc5\x9auchi of Havyavahana, the fire\nof the gods; and Pavamana of Saharaksha, the fire of the Asuras. The Bhagavata\nexplains these different fires to be so many appellations of fire employed in\nthe invocations with which different oblations to fire are offered in the\nritual of the Vedas: ### explained by the commentator, ###.\n\n[84:10](vp045.htm#fr_249) According to the commentator, this distinction is\nderived from the Vedas. The first class, or Agnishwattas, consists of those\nhouseholders who, when alive, did not maintain their domestic fires, nor offer\nburnt-sacrifices: the second, of those who kept up the household flame, and\npresented oblations with fire. Manu calls these Agnidagdhas and the reverse,\nwhich Sir W. Jones renders, 'consumable by fire,' &c. Kulluka Bhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a gives\nno explanation of them. The Bhagavata adds other classes of Pitris; or, the\n\xc3\x81jyapas, drinkers of ghee;' and Somapas, drinkers of the acid juice.' The\ncommentator, explaining the meaning of the terms Sagnayas and Anagnyas, has,\n### which might be understood to signify, that the Pitris who are 'without\nfire' are those to whom oblations are not offered; and those 'with fire' are\nthey to whom oblations are presented.\n\n[84:11](vp045.htm#fr_250) The Vayu carries this genealogy forward. Dharani was\nmarried to Meru, and p. 85 had by him Mandara and three daughters, Niyati,\n\xc3\x81yati, and Vela: the two first were married to Dhatri and Vidhatri ([p.\n81](vp044.htm#page_81)). Vela was the wife of Samudra, by whom she had\nSamudri, married to Prachinavarhish, and the mother of the ten Prachetasas,\nthe fathers of Daksha, as subsequently narrated. Mena was married to Himavat,\nand was the mother of Mainaka, and of Ganga, and of Parvati or Uma.\n\n[85:12](vp045.htm#fr_251) No notice is here taken of Sati, married to Bhava,\nas is intimated in c. 8 ([p. 59](vp042.htm#page_59)), when describing the\nRudras. Of these genealogies the fullest and apparently the oldest account is\ngiven in the Vayu P.: as far as that of our text extends, the two nearly\nagree, allowing for differences of appellation originating in inaccurate\ntranscription, the names frequently varying in different copies of the same\nwork, leaving it doubtful which reading should be preferred. The Bhagavata, as\nobserved above ([p. 54](vp041.htm#page_54). n. [12](vp041.htm#fn_210)), has\ncreated some further perplexity by substituting, as the wives of the\npatriarchs, the daughters of Kardama for those of Daksha. Of the general\nstatement it may be observed, that although in some respects allegorical, as\nin the names of the wives of the Rishis ([p. 54](vp041.htm#page_54)); and in\nothers astronomical, as in the denominations of the daughters of Anginas (p.\n82); yet it seems probable that it is not altogether fabulous, but that the\npersons in some instances had a real existence, the genealogies originating in\nimperfectly preserved traditions of the families of the first teachers of the\nHindu religion, and of the descent of individuals who took an active share in\nits propagation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XI](vp046.htm)\n\n"
