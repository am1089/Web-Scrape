The morning rites were done  \nAnd the victorious Raghu's son  \nAddressed the sage in words like these,  \nRich in his long austerities:  \n'The night is past: the morn is clear;  \nTold is the tale so good to hear:  \nNow o'er that river let us go,  \nThree-pathed, the best of all that flow.  \nThis boat stands ready on the shore  \nTo bear the holy hermits o'er,  \nWho of thy coming warned, in haste,  \nThe barge upon the bank have placed.'  \n\nAnd Kas'ik's son approved his speech,  \nAnd moving to the sandy beach,  \nPlaced in the boat the hermit band,  \nAnd reached the river's further strand.  \nOn the north bank their feet they set,  \nAnd greeted all the ( _illegible_ ) they met.  \nOn Ganga's shore they lighted down,  \nAnd saw Vis'ada's lovely town.  \nThither, the princes by his side,  \nThe best of holy hermits hied.  \nIt was a town exceeding fair  \n\np. 57  \n\nThat might with heaven itself compare.  \nThen, suppliant palm to palm applied,  \nFamed Rama asked his holy guide:  \n'O best of hermits, say what race  \nOf monarchs rules this lovely place.  \nDear master, let my prayer prevail,  \nFor much I long to hear the tale.'  \nMoved by his words, the saintly man  \nVis'ala's ancient tale began:  \n'List, Rama, list, with closest heed  \nThe tale of Indra's wondrous deed,  \nAnd mark me as I truly tell  \nWhat here in ancient days befell.  \nEre Krita's famous Age 1 had fled.  \nStrong were the sons of Diti 2 bred;  \nAnd Aditi's brave children too  \nWere very mighty, good, and true.  \nThe rival brothers fierce and bold  \nWere sons of Kas'yap lofty-souled.  \nOf sister mothers born, they vied,  \nBrood against brood, in jealous pride.  \nOnce, as they say, band met with band,  \nAnd, joined in awful council, planned  \nTo live, unharmed by age and time,  \nImmortal in their youthful prime.  \nThen this was, after due debate,  \nThe counsel of the wise and great,  \nTo churn with might the milky sea 3  \nThe life-bestowing drink to free.  \nThis planned, they seized the Serpent King,  \nVasuki, for their churning-string,  \nAnd Mandar's mountain for their pole,  \nAnd churned with all their heart and soul.  \nAs thus, a thousand seasons through,  \nThis way and that the snake they drew,  \nBiting the rocks, each tortured head,  \nA very deadly venom shed.  \nThence, bursting like a mighty flame,  \nA pestilential poison came,  \nConsuming, as it onward ran,  \nThe home of God, and fiend, and man.  \nThen all the suppliant Gods in fear  \nTo S'ankar 4, mighty lord, drew near.  \nTo Rudra, King of Herds, dismayed,  \n'Save us, O save us, Lord!' they prayed.  \nThen Vishnu, bearing shell, and mace,  \nAnd discus, showed his radiant face,  \nAnd thus addressed in smiling glee  \nThe Trident wielding deity:  \nWhat treasure first the Gods upturn  \nFrom troubled Ocean, as they churn,  \nShould--for thou art the eldest--be  \nConferred, O best of Gods, on thee.  \n\nThen come, and for thy birthright's sake,  \nThis venom as thy firstfruits take.'  \nHe spoke, and vanished from their sight.  \nWhen Siva saw their wild affright,  \nAnd heard his speech by whom is borne  \nThe mighty bow of bending horn, 1b  \nThe poisoned flood at once he quaffed  \nAs 'twere the Amrit's heavenly draught.  \nThen from the Gods departing went  \nS'iva, the Lord pre-eminent.  \nThe host of Gods and Asurs still  \nKept churning with one heart and will.  \nBut Mandar's mountain, whirling round.  \nPierced to the depths below the ground.  \nThen Gods and bards in terror flew  \nTo him who mighty Madhu slew.  \n'Help of all beings! more than all,  \nThe Gods on thee for aid may call.  \nWard off, O mighty-armed! our fate,  \nAnd bear up Mandar's threatening weight.'  \nThen Vishnu, as their need was sore,  \nThe semblance of a tortoise wore,  \nAnd in the bed of Ocean lay  \nThe mountain on his back to stay.  \nThen he, the soul pervading all,  \nWhose locks in radiant tresses fall,  \nOne mighty arm extended still,  \nAnd grasped the summit of the hill.  \nSo ranged among the Immortals, he  \nJoined in the churning of the sea.  \n\nA thousand years had reached their close,  \nWhen calmly from the ocean rose  \nThe gentle sage 2b with staff and can,  \nLord of the art of healing man.  \nThen as the waters foamed and boiled.  \nAs churning still the Immortals toiled,  \nOf winning face and lovely frame,  \nForth sixty million fair ones came.  \nBorn of the foam and water, these  \nWere aptly named Apsarases. 3b  \n\np. 58  \n\nEach had her maids. The tongue would fail--  \nSo vast the throng--to count the tale,  \nBut when no God or Titan wooed  \nA wife from all that multitude,  \nRefused by all, they gave their love  \nIn common to the Gods above.  \nThen from the sea still vext and wild  \nRose Sura, 1 Varun's maiden child.  \nA fitting match she sought to find:  \nBut Diti's sons her love declined.  \nTheir kinsmen of the rival brood  \nTo the pure maid in honour sued.  \nHence those who loved that nymph so fair  \nThe hallowed name of Suras bear.  \nAnd Asurs are the Titan crowd  \nHer gentle claims who disallowed.  \nThen from the foamy sea was freed  \nUchchaihs'ravas, 2 the generous steed,  \nAnd Kaustubha, of gems the gem, 3  \nAnd Soma, Moon God, after them.  \n\nAt length when many a year had fled,  \nUp floated, on her lotus bed,  \nA maiden fair and tender-eyed,  \nIn the young flush of beauty's pride.  \nShe shone with pearl and golden sheen,  \nAnd seals of glory stamped her queen.  \nOn each round arm glowed many a gem,  \nOn her smooth brows, a diadem,  \nRolling in waves beneath her crown  \nThe glory of her hair flowed down.  \nPearls on her neck of price untold,  \nThe lady shone like burnisht gold.  \nQueen of the Gods, she leapt to land,  \nA lotus in her perfect hand,  \n\nAnd fondly, of the lotus-sprung,  \nTo lotus-bearing Vishnu clung.  \nHer Gods above and men below  \nAs Beauty's Queen and Fortune know. [1b](ry046.htm#fn_210)  \nGods, Titans, and the minstrel train  \nStill churned and wrought the troubled main.  \nAt length the prize so madly sought,  \nThe Amrit, to their sight was brought.  \nFor the rich spoil,'twixt these and those  \nA fratricidal war arose,  \nAnd, host 'gainst host in battle, set,  \nAditi's sons and Diti's met.  \nUnited, with the giants' aid,  \nTheir fierce attack the Titans made,  \nAnd wildly raged for many a day  \nThat universe-astounding fray.  \nWhen wearied arms were faint to strike,  \nAnd ruin threatened all alike,  \nVishnu, with art's illusive aid,  \nThe Amrit from their sight conveyed.  \nThat Best of Beings smote his foes  \nWho dared his deathless arm oppose:  \nYea, Vishnu, all-pervading God,  \nBeneath his feet the Titans trod  \nAditi's race, the sons of light,  \nslew Diti's brood in cruel fight.  \nThen town-destroying [2b](ry046.htm#fn_211) Indra gained  \nHis empire, and in glory reigned  \nO'er the three worlds with bard and sage  \nRejoicing in his heritage.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[57:1](ry045.htm#fr_200) The first or Golden Age.\n\n[57:2](ry045.htm#fr_201) Diti and Aditi were wives of Kas'yap, and mothers\nrespectively of Titans and Gods.\n\n[57:3](ry045.htm#fr_202) One of the seven seas surrounding as many worlds in\nconcentric rings.\n\n[57:4](ry045.htm#fr_203) S'ankar and Rudra are names of S'iva.\n\n[57:1b](ry045.htm#fr_204) S'arigin, literally _carrying a bow of horn_ , is a\nconstantly recurring name of Vishnu. The Indians also, therefore, knew the art\nof making bows out of the hons of antelopes or wild goats, which Homer\nascribes to the Trojans of the heroic age.' SCHLEGEL.\n\n[57:2b](ry045.htm#fr_205) Dhanvantari, the physician of the Gods.\n\n[57:3b](ry045.htm#fr_206) The poet plays upon the word and fancifully derives\nit from _apsu_ , the locative case plural of _ap_ , water, and _rasa_ ,\ntaste.... The word is probably derived from _ap_ , water, and _sri_ , to go,\nand seems to signify _inhabitants of the water_ , nymphs of the stream; or, as\nGoldstucker thinks (Dict. s.v.) these divinities were originally\npersonifications of the vapours which are attracted by the sun and form into\nmist or clouds.\n\n[58:1](ry045.htm#fr_207) ' _Sur a_, the feminine comprehends all sorts of\nintoxicating liquors, many kinds of which the Indians from the earliest times\ndistilled and prepared from rice, sugar-cane, the palm tree, and various\nflowers and plants. Nothing is considered more disgraceful among orthodox\nHindus than drunkenness, and the use of wine is forbidden not only to Brahmans\nbut the two other orders as well.... So it clearly appears derogatory to the\ndignity of the Gods to have received a nymph so pernicious, who ought rather\nto have been made over to the Titans. However the etymological fancy has\nprevailed. The word _Sura_ , a God, is derived from the indeclinable _Svar_\nheaven.' SCHLEGEL.\n\n[58:2](ry045.htm#fr_208) Literally, high-eared, the horse of Indra. Compare\nthe production of the horse from the sea by Neptune.\n\n[58:3](ry045.htm#fr_209)  \n     'And Kaustubha the best  \n   Of gems that burns with living light  \n   Upon Lord Vishnu's breast.'  \n                  _Churning of the Ocean._  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLVI.: Diti's Hope.](ry046.htm)\n\n"
