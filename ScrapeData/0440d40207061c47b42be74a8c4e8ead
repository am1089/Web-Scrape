Nund Jee one day called all the cowherds, and said to\nthem, "Brothers! when Krishnu was born, I made a vow to my family Dewee and\nUnbika, that I would go in musical procession with all the city, and perform\npoojah on his twelfth birth-day. As, through the mercy of Dewee, I have lived\nto see his twelfth birth-day, which is to-day, we must go and perform the\npoojah."\n\nAll the cowherds arose, on hearing these words of Nund Jee, and immediately\nbrought forth from their houses all things necessary for the poojah. Nund Rae\ndid the same, and loaded carts and bhangees with milk, curds and butter; and\naccompanied them with all his relations, and arrived at the abode of Unbika.\nHaving gone and bathed in the river Suruswutee, Nund Jee sent for a family\npriest, and went, accompanied by all his retinue, to the temple of Dewee, and\nperformed poojah. And having placed before her all the different articles they\nhad brought to offer, and having performed the act of going round to the right\nby way of adoration, they exclaimed with joined hands and in a supplicating\nmanner, "O mother! through\n\np. 118\n\nyour beneficence, Krishnu has attained the age of twelve years."\n\nHaving thus spoken, and bowing their heads, they quitted the temple, and fed a\nthousand Brahmins. In consequence of the delay which this caused, Nund Jee\nremained there with all the inhabitants of Bruj, and they fasted, as they\nwould at a place of holy pilgrimage. As they were sleeping at night, a boa\ncame and seized Nund Rae\'s foot, and began swallowing it. He was alarmed at\nseeing this, and called out, "Krishnu! Krishnu! take thought of me quickly:\notherwise the snake will swallow me up." On hearing his voice, all the\ninhabitants of Bruj, both men and women, started from sleep, and came to where\nNund was. Having struck a light, they saw a boa lying on the ground, having\nhold of his foot. In the meantime, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee having arrived,\nplaced his foot upon its back in sight of them all. On which the snake,\nimmediately abandoning its former body, was transformed into a handsome man;\nand having made an obeisance, stood before them with joined hands. Then Shree\nKrishnu enquired, "Who art thou, and explain for what crime thou wast\ntransformed into a snake?" He, bowing his head, said in a supplicating voice,\n"O thou who knowest the secrets of the heart! all the circumstances of my\norigin are known to thee. I am a celestial dancer, named Soodursun, and dwelt\nin the region of the gods; and through pride thought myself superior to all\nothers in beauty and excellence of mind; I went forth one day, seated in my\nchariot, to the place where Angira, the saint, was sitting, engaged in\nreligious devotion. And I went backwards and forwards a hundred times over\nhim. Once on seeing the shadow of my chariot, he looked up, and being angry\npronounced a curse upon me, saying, \'O presumptuous: be thou changed into a\nboa.\' As he uttered these words, I fell to the earth, in the form of a boa.\n\n"The saint told me at the time that my release would be accomplished by Shree\nKrishnu Chund. For this reason, I\n\np. 119\n\ncame and seized the foot of Nund Rae Jee, in order that you might come and\ngrant me release. O lord of compassion! you have come, and mercifully released\nme." Thus having spoken, the celestial dancer circled to the right by way of\nadoration; and having obtained Krishnu\'s permission to depart, ascended his\nchariot, and went to the region of the gods.\n\nOn beholding this wonderful act, all the inhabitants of Bruj were astonished.\nIn the morning, having gone to see Dewee, they all returned together to\nBrindabun.\n\nHaving recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said,--O\nlord of the earth! Huldhur and Gobind one moonlight night were singing in the\nforest with the cowherdesses, and enjoying themselves, when a demi-god,\nattendant of Kooveru, named Sunkhchoor, who had a jewel on his head, and was\nvery powerful, came forth amongst them. He saw the cowherdesses engaged in\nsports on one side, and in another direction Shree Krishnu and Buldeo\nintoxicated, and singing in a state of great delight. A thought having\noccurred to him, he collected all the women of Bruj together, and drove them\nbefore him. The women were frightened, and called out to Krishnu and Bulram to\nprotect them. The brothers having heard the cries of the women, uprooted a\ntree, and seizing it in their hands, rushed forth as drunken elephants rush\nupon lions, and told the cowherdesses not to be at all alarmed, as they had\narrived. The demi-god, looking upon them as the agents of his destruction, was\nfilled with fear; and ran off for his life, leaving the cowherdesses. Nund Lal\nleft Buldeo with them, and went after Sunkhchoor himself, and seizing him by\nthe hair behind, brought him to the ground. After this, lowering his hand, he\ncut off his head, and taking possession of his jewel, gave it to Bulram.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXVI](psa37.htm)\n\n'
