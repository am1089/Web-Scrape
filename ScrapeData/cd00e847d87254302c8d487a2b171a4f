I crave at length  \nRepose and ease for broken strength.  \nFeeble and worn I scarce can bear  \nThe ruler's toil, the judge's care,  \nWith royal dignity, a weight  \nThat tries the young and temperate.  \n\nI long to rest, my labour done,  \nAnd in my place to set my son,  \nIf to the twice-born gathered here  \nMy counsel wise and good appear.  \nFor greater gifts than mine adorn  \nRama my son, my eldest-born.  \nLike Indra brave, before him fall  \nThe foeman's cities, tower and wall.  \nHim prince of men for power and might,  \nThe best maintainer of the right,  \nFair as the moon when nothing bars  \nHis glory close to Pushya's stars,  \nHim with to-morrow's light I fain  \nWould throne the consort of my reign,  \nA worthy lord for you, I ween,  \nMarked as her own by Fortune's Queen.  \nThe triple world itself would be  \nWell ruled by such a king as he.  \nTo such high bliss and happy fate  \nWill I the country dedicate,  \nAnd my sad heart will cease to grieve  \nIf he the precious charge receive.  \nThus is my careful plan matured,  \nThus for myself is rest secured;  \nLieges, approve the words I say,  \nOr point ye out some wiser way.  \nDevise your prudent plan. My mind  \nIs fondly to this thought inclined,  \nBut men by keen debating move  \nSome middle course which all approve.'  \n\nThe monarch ceased. In answer came  \nThe joyous princes' glad acclaim.  \nSo peacocks in the rain rejoice  \nAnd hail the cloud with lifted voice.  \nMurmurs of joy from thousands round  \nShook the high palace with the sound.  \nThen when the gathered throng had learned  \nHis will who right and gain discerned,  \nPeasant and townsman, priest and chief,  \nAll met in consultation brief,  \nAnd soon agreed with one accord  \nGave answer to their sovereign lord:  \n'King of the land, we know thee old:  \nThousands of years have o'er thee rolled,  \nRama thy son, we pray, anoint.  \nAnd at thy side his place appoint  \nOur gallant prince, so brave and strong,  \nRiding in royal state along,  \nOur eyes with joyful pride will see  \nScreened by the shade that shelters thee.'  \nThen spake the king again, as though  \nTheir hearts' true wish he sought to know:  \n'These prayers for Rama's rule suggest  \nOne question to my doubting breast.  \nThis thing, I pray, with truth explain:  \nWhy would ye, while I justly reign,  \nThat he, mine eldest son, should bear  \nHis part with me as ruling heir?'  \nThen all the people made reply,  \nPeasant and townsman, low and high:  \n' Each noblest gift of form and mind,  \n\np. 91  \n\nO Monarch, in thy son we find.  \nDo thou the godlike virtues hear  \nWhich Rama to our hearts endear.  \nSo richly blest with graces, none  \nIn all the earth excels thy son:  \nNay, who to match with him may claim  \nIn truth, in justice, and in fame?  \nTrue to his promise, gentle, kind,  \nUnenvious, of grateful mind,  \nVersed in the law and firm of soul,  \nHe keeps each sense with strict control.  \nWith duteous care he loves to sit  \nBy Brahmans skilled in Holy Writ.  \nHence brightest glory, ne'er to end,  \nAnd matchless fame his youth attend.  \nSkilled in the use of spear and shield.  \nAnd arms which heavenly warriors wield,  \nSupreme in war, unconquered yet  \nBv man, fiend, God in battle met,  \nWhene'er in pomp of war he goes  \n'Gainst town or city of the foes,  \nHe ever comes with Lakshman back  \nVictorious from the fierce attack.  \nReturning homeward from afar  \nBorne on his elephant or car,  \nHe ever to the townsmen bends  \nAnd greets them as beloved friends,  \nAsks how each son, each servant thrives,  \nHow fare our pupils, offerings, wives;  \nAnd like a father bids us tell,  \nEach for himself, that all is well.  \nIf pain or grief the city tries  \nHis heart is swift to sympathize.  \nWhen festive scenes our thoughts employ  \nHe like a father shares the joy.  \nHigh is the fate, O King, that gave  \nThy Rama born to bless and save,  \nWith filial virtues fair and mild  \nLike Kas'yap old Marichi's child.  \nHence to the kingdom's distant ends  \nOne general prayer for him ascends.  \nEach man in town and country prays  \nFor Rama's strength, health, length of days.  \nWith hearts sincere, their wish the same,  \nThe tender girl, the aged dame,  \nSubject and stranger, peasant, hind,  \nOne thought impressed on every mind,  \nAt evening and at dawning day  \nTo all the Gods for Rama pray.  \nDo thou, O King, of grace comply,  \nAnd hear the people's longing cry,  \nAnd let us on the throne by thee  \nThe lotus-tinted Rama see.  \n   O thou who givest boons, attend;  \n   A gracious ear, O Monarch, lend  \n     And for our weal install,  \nConsenting to our earnest prayer,  \nThy godlike Rama Regent Heir,  \n     Who seeks the good of all.'  \n\n        * * * *   \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[90:1](ry080.htm#fr_260) Chief of the insignia of imperial dignity.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto III.: Das'aratha's Precepts.](ry081.htm)\n\n"
