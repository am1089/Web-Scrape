For at that time the gods were afraid lest\nthe fiends, the Rakshas, should destroy that (Agni's body) of theirs (built)\nthere 2. They saw these strongholds, the Upasads, to wit, these worlds, for\nthese worlds are indeed strongholds. They entered them, and having entered\nthem, they completed that body in a place free from danger and devilry; and in\nlike manner does the Sacrificer now, after entering these strongholds,\ncomplete this body in a place free from danger and devilry.\n\n10:2:5:22\\. And, again, as to why he builds between the Upasads. At this time\nthe gods were afraid lest the fiends, the Rakshas, should destroy that (Agni's\nbody) of theirs (built) there. They saw these thunderbolts, the Upasads, for\nthe Upasads indeed are thunderbolts: they entered them 3, and, having entered\nthem, they completed that body in a place free from danger and devilry; and in\nlike manner does the Sacrificer now, after entering those thunderbolts,\n\np. 317\n\ncomplete this body (of Agni) in a place free from danger and devilry.\n\n10:2:5:33\\. And the Upasads also are the fervour 1 in the sacrifice, for they\nare indeed fervour; and inasmuch as it is built ( _k_ i) in fervour (tapas) it\nis called 'Tapa _s_ _k_ ita 2.' As long as they perform the Upasads so long\n(do they perform) the Pravargya 3: (if) it is for a year. that they perform\nthe Upasads, it is for a year (they perform) the Pravargya.\n\n10:2:5:44\\. The Upasads, indeed, are the days and nights, and the Pravargya is\nthe sun: he thus establishes yonder sun on the days and nights, whence he is\nestablished on the days and nights.\n\n10:2:5:55\\. And 'if there are twenty-four (Upasad-days 4), there being twenty-\nfour half moons--the Upasads\n\np. 318\n\nare the half-moons, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus establishes yonder\nsun on the half-moons, whence he is established on the half-moons.\n\n10:2:5:66\\. And if there are twelve (Upasad-days) 1\\--there being twelve\nmonths--the Upasads are the months, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus\nestablishes yonder sun on the months, whence he is established on the months.\n\n10:2:5:77\\. And if there are six (Upasad-days)--there being six seasons--the\nUpasads are the seasons, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus establishes\nyonder sun in the seasons, whence he is established in the seasons.\n\n10:2:5:88\\. And if there are three (Upasad-days)--there being these three\nworlds--the Upasads are these three worlds, and the Pravargya is the sun: he\nthus establishes yonder sun in these worlds, whence he is established in these\nworlds.\n\n10:2:5:99\\. Now, then, the inquiry as to the earth-layers of the altar-pile.\nOne month (the building of) the first layer (of bricks takes), and one month\nthe layer of earth 2,--so long desire (lasts) in the spring season (of two\nmonths): he thus 3 builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever\ndesire there is in the spring season 4.\n\np. 319\n\n10:2:5:1010\\. One month the second (layer of bricks takes), and one month the\nlayer of earth,--so long desire (lasts) in the summer season: he thus builds\nfor himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the\nsummer season.\n\n10:2:5:1111\\. One month the third (layer of bricks takes), and one month the\nlayer of earth,--so long desire (lasts) in the rainy season: he thus builds\nfor himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the\nrainy reason.\n\n10:2:5:1212\\. One month the fourth (layer of bricks takes), and one month the\nlayer of earth,--so long desire (lasts) in the autumn season: he thus builds\nfor himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the\nautumn season.\n\n10:2:5:1313\\. And of the fifth layer (of bricks) he lays down the Asapatna and\nVira _g_ (bricks) on the first day, and of the Stomabhagas one each day: these\nhe 'settles' together once, and pronounces once the sudadohas-formula over\nthem 1. For a month they silently apply the earth-layer for the Stomabhagas,\nfor so long desire (lasts) in the winter season: thus he builds for himself a\nbody so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the winter season.\n\n10:2:5:1414\\. One month the sixth (layer of bricks takes),\n\np. 320\n\nand one month the layer of earth,--so long desire (lasts) in the dewy season:\nhe thus builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there\nis in the dewy season. So long, indeed, desire (lasts) in the twelve months\nand the six seasons: he thus builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of\nwhatever desire there is in the twelve months and the six seasons.\n\n10:2:5:1515\\. And in addition to these there are three days 1, to wit, the day\non which he performs the _S_ atarudriya offering, the day of preparation, and\nthe day on which the Soma is pressed. When they perform the Upasad on these\ndays, these (days) are the days and nights of that (thirteenth, or\nintercalary) month: and when (they perform) the Pravargya, he thereby\nestablishes yonder sun also in that (seventh) season,--so long, indeed, desire\n(lasts) in the thirteen months and the seven seasons: he thus builds for\nhimself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in thirteen\nmonths and seven seasons.\n\n10:2:5:1616\\. For a year Soma should be pressed,--the year is everything, and\nthe one hundred and one-fold (altar) is everything: by means of everything he\nthus gains everything. Should he be unable (to press Soma) for a year, he\nshould perform the Vi _s_ va _g_ it Atiratra 2 with all the\n\np. 321\n\n[paragraph continues] P _ri_ sh _th_ as 1, and at that (sacrifice) he should\ngive away all his property 2; for the Vi _s_ va _g_ it (all-conquering)\nAtiratra with all the P _ri_ sh _th_ as means everything, and all one's\nproperty means everything, and the one hundred and one-fold (altar) means\neverything: by means of everything he thus gains everything.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[316:1](sbe4354.htm#fr_615) The Upasads (or sieges) are performed twice a day\non at least three days (the regular number for ordinary one day's Soma-\nsacrifices) intervening between the end of the Diksha (initiation) and the day\nof the Soma-sacrifice; see part ii, p. 105, note 1. On the first day the first\nlayer is built between the two performances (whilst the final preparation of\nthe altar-site, as well as the building of the Garhapatya altar and the\ninstallation of the Ukhya Agni thereon, takes place before the morning\nperformance of the Upasads), and on the second day the remaining layers are\nbuilt.\n\n[316:2](sbe4354.htm#fr_616) For the construction in the _oratio directa_ , see\npart iii, p. 34, note 2.\n\n[316:3](sbe4354.htm#fr_617) Or, they went into their shelter (pra-pad).\n\n[317:1](sbe4354.htm#fr_618) Or, austere devotion, see III, 4, 4, 27, where\nfasting during the Upasad days is recommended as calculated to promote\nreligious fervour. There is also, however, the primary' meaning 'heat'\nimplied, whence the 'heating' of the cauldron (gharma--\xce\xb8\xce\xb5\xcf\x81\xce\xbc\xcf\x8c\xcf\x82) at the\nPravargya (representing the sun) is connected with the Upasads.\n\n[317:2](sbe4354.htm#fr_619) That is, the fire-altar used at the sacrificial\nperiod (ayana) called Tapa _s_ _k_ ita, which generally requires a full year\n(360 days) for the performance of the Upasads (as do also the Diksha\\- before\nthem, and the performance of the Soma-sacrifice after them); cf. XII, 3, 3, 10\nseq.; Katy. XIV, 5, 1.--\xc3\x82 _s_ val. XII, 5, 9; Katy. XXIV, 5, 7, however,\nmention a Tapa _s_ _k_ ita which only requires four months for each of the\nthree periods, or a year altogether, whilst the maximum duration is by \xc3\x82 _s_\nv. fixed at thirty-six years (twelve for each period); and by Katy. at three\nyears for the Upasads and a year for each of the two other ceremonies.\n\n[317:3](sbe4354.htm#fr_620) See part ii, p. 304.\n\n[317:4](sbe4354.htm#fr_621) Saya _n_ a does not specify what sacrificial\nperformance is intended as requiring twenty-four Upasad-days, but merely says\nthat they are required 'kratuvi _s_ eshe,' at some special kind of sacrifice.\nAt all events, the Sacrificer would be at liberty to adopt that number of\nUpasad-days instead of the minimum of days prescribed, if he hoped to derive\nspecial benefit therefrom.\n\n[318:1](sbe4354.htm#fr_622) For an ordinary Ekaha, or one day's Soma-\nsacrifice, the Upasads may be performed for twelve days instead of the usual\nthree days (Katy. VIII, 2, 40). It is also the regular number of days for\nAhinas (ib. XIII, i, x; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. IV, 8, 15) and for most sattras.\n\n[318:2](sbe4354.htm#fr_623) That is, when the Upasads last for a whole year,\nas at the Tapa _s_ _k_ ita.\n\n[318:3](sbe4354.htm#fr_624) That is, by building for his Soma-sacrifice an\naltar the body of which requires a whole year in being laid down, as it does\nin the Tapa _s_ _k_ ita.\n\n[318:4](sbe4354.htm#fr_625) Translated literally, the sentence would run thus:\n'Thus as p. 319 much desire as there is in the spring season--he builds for\nhimself a body so as to obtain all that (desire).' Only the building of an\naltar (body) for a whole year ensures the full fruition of sensual pleasures\nsupplied during the year.\n\n[319:1](sbe4354.htm#fr_626) That is, these three kinds of bricks--the five\nAsapatnas, and forty Vira _g_ s being laid down on the first day, and of the\ntwenty-nine Stomabhagas one each day,--the three kinds of bricks thus take one\nmonth in being laid down, after which the 'sadanam' and 'Sudadohas' (cf. part\niii, p. 301, note 3) are performed upon them.\n\n[320:1](sbe4354.htm#fr_627) Viz. after the twenty-eight days of the twelfth\nmonth two days remain to make up the year, so that the (first) Sutya day\n(pressing day) takes place after the expiry of a full year.\n\n[320:2](sbe4354.htm#fr_628) The Vi _s_ va _g_ it, as usually performed, is an\nAgnish _t_ oma sacrifice, the twelve Stotras of which are chanted in three\ndifferent stomas or hymn-forms, viz. the first four in the triv _ri_ t (nine-\nversed), the next four in the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a (fifteen-versed), and the\nlast four in the saptada _s_ a (seventeen-versed) stoma. For the stotriya-\ntexts see p. 321 Ta _n_ _d_ ya-Br. XVI, 5, 1 seq. It is closely united with\nthe Abhi _g_ it Soma-day--the stotras of which are performed in four stomas,\nviz. three in each of those used for the Vi _s_ va _g_ it, and the last three\nin the ekavi _m_ _s_ a, or twenty-one-versed, stoma--with which it may,\nindeed, be combined in one and the same performance; and both form part of the\nsacrificial session called Gavam ayanam (part ii, p. 427). The Vi _s_ va _g_\nit (as well as the Abhi _g_ it) may, however, also be performed as an Atiratra\ninstead of Agnish _t_ oma, and in that case the sequence of Stomas is entirely\ndifferent, their order being as follows: the first four stotras are performed\nin the first four stomas (triv _ri_ t, pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a, saptada _s_ a,\nekavi _m_ _s_ a); the next four stotras in the four stomas beginning with the\nsecond stoma (up to tri _n_ ava), and the next four stotras in the four stomas\nbeginning with the third stoma (up to trayast _ri_ _m_ _s_ a). Of the three\nUkthastotras, the first is performed in the tri _n_ ava, and the two others in\nthe ekavi _m_ _s_ a; the Sho _d_ a _s_ in in its own (ekavi _m_ _s_ a) form;\nthe night-chants in the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a; and the twilight-chant in the\ntriv _ri_ t-stoma. See Ta _n_ _d_ ya-Br. XX, 9.\n\n[321:1](sbe4354.htm#fr_629) On 'sarvap _ri_ sh _th_ a' Soma-days, see part\niii, introduction, pp. xx seq.\n\n[321:2](sbe4354.htm#fr_630) As an equivalent for one's 'whole property\n(sarvavedasa, sarvasva),' Katyayana (XXII, 2, 26. 27) enumerates 'cows, oxen,\nploughs, sacks of corn (or corn-sacks), pairs of slaves, waggons, animals for\nriding, houses (or sheds), and couches.' For other similar enumerations, see\nA. Weber, Omina and Portenta (Abb. of Berl. Acad. 1858), p. 398.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 2, 6. Sixth Brahma _n_ a](sbe4355.htm)\n\n"
