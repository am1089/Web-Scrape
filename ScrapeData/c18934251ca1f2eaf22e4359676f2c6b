They say: 'What is the meaning of pre\xe1\xb9\x85kha, swing?' Verily, he is the\nswing, who blows (the wind). He indeed goes forward (pra + i\xe1\xb9\x85khate) in these\nworlds, and that is why the swing is called pre\xe1\xb9\x85kha.\n\n2\\. Some say, that there should be one plank, because the wind blows in one\nway, and it should be like the wind.\n\n3\\. That is not to be regarded.\n\n4\\. Some say, there should be three planks, because there are these three\nthreefold worlds, and it should be like them.\n\np. 173\n\n5\\. That is not to be regarded.\n\n6\\. Let there be two, for these two worlds (the earth and heaven) are seen as\nif most real, while the ether (space) between the two is the sky (antariksha).\nTherefore let there be two planks.\n\n7\\. Let them be made of Udumbara wood. Verily, the Udumbara tree is sap and\neatable food, and thus it serves to obtain sap and eatable food.\n\n8\\. Let them be elevated in the middle (between the earth and the cross-beam).\nFood, if placed in the middle, delights man, and thus he places the sacrificer\nin the middle of eatable food.\n\n9\\. There are two kinds of rope, twisted towards the right and twisted towards\nthe left. The right ropes serve for some animals, the left ropes for others.\nIf there are both kinds of rope, they serve for the attainment of both kinds\nof cattle.\n\n10\\. Let them be made of Darbha (Ku _s_ a grass), for among plants Darbha is\nfree from evil, therefore they should be made of Darbha grass.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[172:3](sbe01186.htm#fr_420) After having considered the Marutvatiya, he\nproceeds to consider the Nishkevalya. This has to be recited by the Hot _ri_\nwhile sitting on a swing.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 4](sbe01187.htm)\n\n"
