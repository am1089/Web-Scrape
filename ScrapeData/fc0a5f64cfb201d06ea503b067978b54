What is Agr\xc4\x81hya? Who is Sanny\xc4\x81si? Thus are the questions.\n\n1\\. What is Brahman?\n\nIt is the Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya that appears, through the aspects of Karma and J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, as\nthis vast mundane egg composed of Maha\xe1\xb9\xad, Aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra and the five elements,\nearth, water, fire, V\xc4\x81yu and [\xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b](errata.htm#2)--that is secondless--that is\ndevoid of all Up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhis [vehicles], that is full of all \xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadis [potencies], that\nis without beginning and end, that is described as pure, beneficial, peaceful,\nand Gu\xe1\xb9\x87a-less and that is indescribable.\n\np. 19\n\n2\\. Who is \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bwara? and what are His characteristics?\n\n[Brahman](errata.htm#3) itself, having through His \xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi called Prak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi\n(matter) created the worlds and being latent in them, becomes the ruler of\nBu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi and In\xe1\xb8\x8driyas (organs of sense and action) as well as Brahma (the\ncreator) and others. Hence he is named \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bwara.\n\n3\\. Who is J\xc4\xabva?\n\n\xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bwara Himself, subject to the false superimposition upon Himself [of the\nidea] "I am the gross" through the [assumption of the] names and forms of\nBrahm\xc4\x81, Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra, In\xe1\xb8\x8dra, and others is J\xc4\xabva. Though one, he appears as\nmany J\xc4\xabvas, through the force of the different Karmas originating the bodies.\n\n4\\. What is Prak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi (matter)?\n\nIt is nothing else but the \xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi [potency] of Brahman which is of the nature\nof Bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi that is able to produce the many motley worlds by virtue of the mere\npresence of Brahman.\n\n5\\. What is Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81?\n\nThe supreme \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 or soul. It is Brahman alone that is Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as it (the\nformer) is far superior to bodies and others.\n\n6\\. Who is Brahm\xc4\x81 [the creator]?  \n7\\. Who is Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u [the preserver]?  \n8\\. Who is Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra [the destroyer]?  \n9\\. Who is In\xe1\xb8\x8dra?  \n10\\. Who is Yama [the angel of death]?  \n11\\. Who is S\xc5\xabrya [the Sun]?  \n12\\. Who is Chan\xe1\xb8\x8dra [the Moon]?  \n13\\. Who are \xe1\xb8\x8cevas [the Angels]?  \n14\\. Who are Asuras [the Demons]?  \n15\\. Who are Pi\xc5\x9b\xc4\x81chas [the evil spirits]?  \n16\\. Who are Manushyas [the men]?  \n17\\. Who are Women?  \n18\\. What are beasts, etc.?  \n19\\. What are the S\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81varas [fixed ones]?  \n20\\. Who are Brahmans and others?\n\nThat Brahman is Brahm\xc4\x81, Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra and In\xe1\xb8\x8dra, Yama, Sun and Moon, \xe1\xb8\x8cevas,\nAsuras, Pi\xc5\x9b\xc4\x81chas, men, women, beasts, etc., the fixed ones, Brahmans and\nothers. Here there is no manyness in the least degree: all this is verily\nBrahman.\n\np. 20\n\n21\\. What is J\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadi (caste)\n\nIt cannot refer to the skin, the blood, the flesh or the bone. There is no\ncaste for \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81; caste is only conventional.\n\n22\\. What is Karma?\n\nKarma is that action alone which is performed by the organs and ascribed to\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 as "I do" ( _viz_., agency being attributed to \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81).\n\n23\\. What is Akarma [or non-Karma]?\n\nAkarma is the performance, without any desire for the fruits, of the daily and\noccasional rites, sacrifices, vows, austerities, gifts and other actions that\nare associated with the egoism of the actor and the enjoyer, and that are\nproductive of bondage, rebirth, etc.\n\n24\\. What is J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na?\n\nIt is the realisation by direct cognition of the fact that in this changing\nuniverse there is nothing but Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya [the one life] that is Consciousness,\nthat is of the form of the seer and the seen, pervading all things, that is\nthe same in all, and that is not subject to changes like pot, cloth, etc. This\nrealisation is brought about by means of the subjugation of the body and the\nsenses, the serving of a good Guru (teacher), the hearing of the exposition of\nVe\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xadic doctrines and constant meditation thereon.\n\n25\\. What is Aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na?\n\nIt is the illusory attribution, like the snake in the rope, of many \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81s\n(souls) through the diverse Up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhis [or vehicles] of the angels, beasts, men,\nthe fixed ones, females, males, castes and orders of life, bondage and\nemancipation, etc., to Brahman that is secondless, all-permeating and of the\nnature of all.\n\n26\\. What is Sukha (happiness)?\n\nIt is a state of being of the nature of bliss, having cognized through\nexperience the Reality of Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da [or that which is be-ness,\nconsciousness and bliss].\n\n27\\. What is \xe1\xb8\x8cu\xe1\xb8\xa5kha (pains)?\n\nIt is the mere Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa [or the thinking] of the objects of mundane existence\n[or of not-Self according to the Bombay Edition].\n\np. 21\n\n28\\. What is Swarga (heaven)?\n\nIt is the association with Sa\xe1\xb9\xad [either good men or Brahman which is Sa\xe1\xb9\xad, the\ntrue].\n\n29\\. What is Naraka (hell)?\n\nIt is the association with that which brings about this mundane existence\nwhich is Asa\xe1\xb9\xad [the false].\n\n30\\. What is Ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha [bondage]?\n\nSuch Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpas [thoughts] as "I was born," etc., arising from the affinities\nof beginningless Aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na form bondage.\n\nThe thought obscuration [or mental ignorance] of the mundane existence of\n"mine" in such as father, mother, brother, wife, child, house, gardens, lands,\netc., forms bondage.\n\nThe thoughts of I-ness as actor, etc., are bondage.\n\nThe thought of the development in oneself of the eight Si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis (higher\npsychical powers) as Anima and others 1 is bondage.\n\nThe thought of propitiating the angels, men, etc., is bondage. The thought of\ngoing through the eight means of Yoga 2 practice, Yama, etc., is bondage.\n\nThe thought of performing the duties of one\'s own caste and order of life is\nbondage.\n\nThe thought that command, fear and doubt are the attributes of [or pertain to]\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is bondage.\n\nThe thought of knowing the rules of performing sacrifices, vows, austerity and\ngift is bondage. Even the mere thought of desire for Moksha (emancipation) is\nbondage. By the very act of thought, bondage is caused.\n\n31\\. What is Moksha [emancipation]?\n\nMoksha is the (state of) the annihilation, through the discrimination of the\neternal from the non-eternal, of all thoughts of bondage, like those of "mine"\nin objects of pleasure and pain, lands, etc., in this transitory mundane\nexistence.\n\n32\\. Who is Up\xc4\x81sya [or fit to be worshipped]?\n\nThat Guru (or spiritual instructor) who enables (the disciple) to attain to\nBrahman, the Consciousness that is in all bodies.\n\np. 22\n\n33\\. Who is \xc5\x9aishya (the disciple)?\n\nThe disciple is that Brahman alone that remains after the consciousness of the\nuniverse has been lost (in him) through Br\xc4\x81hmic wisdom.\n\n34\\. Who is Vi\xe1\xb8\x8dw\xc4\x81n (the learned)?\n\nIt is he who has cognized the true form (or reality) of his own consciousness\nthat is latent in all.\n\n35\\. Who is M\xc5\xabdha [the ignorant]?\n\nHe who has the egoistic conception of the body, caste, orders of life, actor,\nenjoyer and others.\n\n36\\. What is \xc4\x80sura [the demoniacal]?\n\nIt is the \xe1\xb9\xacapas [austerity] practised by one inflicting trouble on the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81\nwithin through Japa [or inaudible muttering of Man\xe1\xb9\xadras], abstinence from food,\nAgniho\xe1\xb9\xadra [the performance of the worship of fire], etc., attended with cruel\ndesire, hatred, pain, hypocrisy and the rest for the purpose of acquiring the\npowers of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, Brahma, Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra, In\xe1\xb8\x8dra and others.\n\n37\\. What is \xe1\xb9\xacapas?\n\n\xe1\xb9\xacapas is the act of burning--through the fire of direct cognition of the\nknowledge that Brahman is the truth and the universe, a myth--the seed of the\ndeep-rooted desire to attain the powers of Brahma, etc.\n\n38\\. What is Paramapa\xe1\xb8\x8da [the supreme abode]?\n\nIt is the seat of the eternal and emancipated Brahman which is far superior to\nPr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as (the vital airs), the organs of sense and actions, the internal organs\n(of thought), the Gu\xe1\xb9\x87as and others, which is of the nature of Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da\nand which is the witness to all.\n\n39\\. What is Gr\xc4\x81hya [or fit to be taken in]?\n\nOnly that Reality of Absolute Consciousness which is not conditioned by space,\ntime or substance.\n\n40\\. What is Agr\xc4\x81hya?\n\nThe thought that this universe is truth--this universe which is different from\none\'s Self and which being subject to M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 (or illusion) forms the object of\n(cognition of) Bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi and the organs.\n\n41\\. Who is the Sanny\xc4\x81si [ascetic]?\n\np. 23\n\nA Sanny\xc4\x81si is an ascetic who having given up all the duties of caste and\norders of life, good and bad actions, etc., being freed from [the conceptions\nof] "I" and "mine" and having taken his refuge in Brahman alone, roams at\nlarge practising Nirvikalpa Sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi and being firmly convinced of "I am\nBrahman" through the realisation of the meaning of such sacred (Vedic)\nsentences as "Thou art That" "All this is verily Brahman" and "Here there is\nno manyness in the least". He only is an emancipated person. He only is fit to\nbe adored. He only is a Yogin. He only is a Paramahamsa. He only is an\nAva\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xada. He only is a Brahman. Whoever studies the Nir\xc4\x81lamba-Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d\nbecomes, through the grace of Guru, pure like fire. Ho becomes pure like V\xc4\x81yu\n(air). He does not return. He is not born again: nay he is not born again.\n\nSuch is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[18:1](tmu05.htm#fr_4) Lit.--without support.\n\n[21:1](tmu05.htm#fr_5) There are 18 Si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhis, 8 higher and 10 lower.\n\n[21:2](tmu05.htm#fr_6) They are Yama, Niyama, etc.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
