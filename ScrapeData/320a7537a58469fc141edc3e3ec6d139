Talavakara or Kena-upanishad,  \n3\\. Aitareya-upanishad,  \n4\\. Kaushitaki-upanishad,  \n5\\. Va _g_ asaneyi or \xc3\x8e _s_ a-upanishad,  \n6\\. Ka _th_ a-upanishad,  \n7\\. Mu _n_ _d_ aka-upanishad,  \n8\\. Taittiriyaka-upanishad,  \n9\\. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka-upanishad,  \n10\\. _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad,  \n11\\. Pra _s_ _\xc3\xb1_ a-upanishad.\n\nThese eleven have sometimes 2 been called the old and genuine Upanishads,\nthough I should be satisfied to call them the eleven classical Upanishads, or\nthe fundamental Upanishads of the Vedanta philosophy.\n\nVidyaranya 3, in his \'Elucidation of the meaning of all the Upanishads,\'\nSarvopanishadarthanubhuti-praka _s_ a, confines himself likewise to those\ntreatises, dropping, however, the \xc3\x8e _s_ a, and adding the Maitraya _n_\na-upanishad, of which I have given a translation in this volume, and the N\n_ri_ si _m_ hottara-tapaniya-upanishad, the translation of which had to be\nreserved for the next volume.\n\np. x\n\nIt is more difficult to determine which of the Upanishads were chosen by _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara or deserving the honour of a special commentary. We possess his\ncommentaries on the eleven Upanishads mentioned before 1, with the exception\nof the Kaushitaki 2-upanishad. We likewise possess his commentary on the\nMandukya-upanishad, but we do not know for certain whether he left\ncommentaries on any of the other Upanishads. Some more or less authoritative\nstatements have been made that he wrote commentaries on some of the minor\nUpanishads, such as the Atharva _s_ iras, Atharva- _s_ ikha, and the N _ri_ si\n_m_ hatapani 3. But as, besides _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara _k_ arya, the disciple of Govinda,\nthere is _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karananda, the disciple of \xc3\x82nandatman, another writer of\ncommentaries on the Upanishads, it is possible that the two names may have\nbeen confounded by less careful copyists 4.\n\nWith regard to the N _ri_ si _m_ hatapani all uncertainty might seem to be\nremoved, after Professor Ramamaya Tarkaratna has actually published its text\nwith the commentary of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85karakarya in the Bibliotheca Indica, Calcutta,\n1871. But some uncertainty still remains. While at the end of each Khanda of\nthe N _ri_ si _m_ ha-purvatapani we read that the Bhashya was the work of the\nParamaha _m_ sa-parivra _g_ aka _k_ arya _S_ ri- _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, the pupil of\nGovinda, we have no such information for the N _ri_ si _m_ ha-uttaratapani,\nbut are told on the contrary that the words _S_ ri-Govindabhagavat &c. have\nbeen added at the end by the editor, because he thought fit to do so. This is,\nto say the least, very suspicious, and we must wait for further confirmation.\nThere is another commentary on this Upanishad by Naraya _n_ abha _t_ _t_ a,\nthe son of Bha _t_ _t_ a Ratnakara 5, who is well known as the author of\nDipikas on several Upanishads.\n\np. xi\n\nI subjoin a list of thirty of the smaller Upanishads, published by Professor\nRamamaya Tarkaratna in the Bibliotheca Indica, with the commentaries of Naraya\n_n_ abha _t_ _t_ a.\n\n1\\. _S_ ira-upanishad,\n\n|\n\npp. 1-10;\n\n|\n\nDipika by Narayana, pp. 42-60.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n2\\.

It may be said that most of them had been\ntranslated before. No doubt they have been, and a careful comparison of my own\ntranslation with those of my predecessors will show, I believe, that a small\nadvance, at all events, has now been made towards a truer understanding of\nthese ancient texts. But I know full well how much still remains to be done,\nboth in restoring a correct text, and in discovering the original meaning of\nthe Upanishads; and I have again and again had to translate certain passages\ntentatively only, or following the commentators, though conscious all the time\nthat the meaning which they extract from the text cannot be the right one.\n\nAs to the text, I explained in my preface to the first volume that I attempted\nno more than to restore the text, such as it must have existed at the time\nwhen _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara wrote his commentaries. As _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara lived during the ninth\ncentury A _D_. 1, and as we possess no MSS. of so early a date, all reasonable\ndemands of textual criticism would thereby seem to be satisfied. Yet, this is\nnot quite so. We may draw such a line, and for the present keep within it, but\nscholars who hereafter take up the study of the\n\np. xiii\n\n[paragraph continues] Upanishads will probably have to go beyond. Where I had\nan opportunity of comparing other commentaries, besides those of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara,\nit became quite clear that they often followed a different text, and when, as\nin the case of the Maitraya _n_ a-brahma _n_ a-upanishad, I was enabled to\ncollate copies which came from the South of India, the opinion which I have\noften expressed of the great value of Southern MSS. received fresh\nconfirmation. The study of Grantha and other Southern MSS. will inaugurate, I\nbelieve, a new period in the critical treatment of Sanskrit texts, and the\ntext of the Upanishads will, I hope, benefit quite as much as later texts by\nthe treasures still concealed in the libraries of the Dekhan.\n\nThe rule which I have followed myself, and which I have asked my fellow\ntranslators to follow, has been adhered to in this new volume also, viz.\nwhenever a choice has to be made between what is not quite faithful and what\nis not quite English, to surrender without hesitation the idiom rather than\nthe accuracy of the translation. I know that all true scholars have approved\nof this, and if some of our critics have been offended by certain unidiomatic\nexpressions occurring in our translations, all I can say is, that we shall\nalways be most grateful if they would suggest translations which are not only\nfaithful, but also idiomatic. For the purpose we have in view, a rugged but\nfaithful translation seems to us more useful than a smooth but misleading one.\n\nHowever, we have laid ourselves open to another kind of censure also, namely,\nof having occasionally not been literal enough. It is impossible to argue\nthese questions in general, but every translator knows that in many cases a\nliteral translation may convey an entirely wrong meaning. I shall give at\nleast one instance.\n\nMy old friend, Mr. Nehemiah Goreh--at least I hope he will still allow me to\ncall him so--in the \'Occasional Papers on Missionary Subjects,\' First Series,\nNo. 6, quotes, on p. 39, a passage from the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad, translates\nit into English, and then remarks that I had not translated it accurately. But\nthe fault seems to me to lie\n\np. xiv\n\nentirely with him, in attempting to translate a passage without considering\nthe whole chapter of which it forms a part. Mr. Nehemiah Goreh states the\nbeginning of the story rightly when he says that a youth by name Svetaketu\nwent, by the advice of his father, to a teacher to study under him. After\nspending twelve years, as was customary, with the teacher, when he returned\nhome he appeared rather elated. Then the father asked him:\n\nUta tam ade _s_ am apraksho 1 yena _s_ ruta _m_ _s_ rutam bhavaty amatam matam\navi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ata _m_ vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ atam iti?\n\nI translated this: \'Have you ever asked for that instruction by which we hear\nwhat cannot be heard, by which we perceive what cannot be perceived, by which\nwe know what cannot be known?\'\n\nMr. Nehemiah Goreh translates: \'Hast thou asked (of thy teacher) for that\ninstruction by which what is not heard becomes heard, what is not comprehended\nbecomes comprehended, what is not known becomes known?\'\n\nI shall not quarrel with my friend for translating man by to comprehend rather\nthan by to perceive. I prefer my own translation, because manas is one side of\nthe common sensory (anta _h_ kara _n_ a), buddhi, the other; the original\ndifference between the two being, so far as I can see, that the manas\noriginally dealt with percepts, the buddhi with concepts 2. But the chief\ndifference on which my critic lays stress is that I translated a _s_ rutam,\namatam, and avi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ atam not by \'not heard, not comprehended, not known,\'\nbut by \'what cannot be heard, what cannot be perceived, what cannot be known.\'\n\nNow, before finding fault, why did he not ask himself what possible reason I\ncould have had for deviating from the original, and for translating avig\xc3\xb1ata\nby unknowable or\n\np. xv\n\nwhat cannot be known, rather than by unknown, as every one would be inclined\nto translate these words at first sight? If he had done so, he would have seen\nin a moment, that without the change which I introduced in the idiom, the\ntranslation would not have conveyed the sense of the original, nay, would have\nconveyed no sense at all. What could Svetaketu have answered, if his father\nhad asked him, whether he had not asked for that instruction by which what is\nnot heard becomes heard, what is not comprehended becomes comprehended, what\nis not known becomes known? He would have answered, \'Yes, I have asked for it;\nand from the first day on which I learnt the _S_ iksha, the A B C, I have\nevery day heard something which I had not heard before, I have comprehended\nsomething which I had not comprehended before, I have known something which I\nhad not known before.\' Then why does he say in reply, \'What is that\ninstruction?\' Surely Mr. Nehemiah Goreh knew that the instruction which the\nfather refers to, is the instruction regarding Brahman, and that in all which\nfollows the father tries to lead his son by slow degrees to a knowledge of\nBrahman 1. Now that Brahman is called again and again \'that which cannot be\nseen, cannot be heard, cannot be perceived, cannot be conceived,\' in the\nordinary sense of these words; can be learnt, in fact, from the Veda only 2.\nIt was in order to bring out this meaning that I translated a _s_ rutam not by\n\'not heard,\' but by \'not hearable,\' or, in better English, by \'what cannot be\nheard 3.\'\n\np. xvi\n\nAny classical scholar knows how often we must translate invictus by\ninvincible, and how Latin tolerates even invictissimus, which we could never\nrender in English by \'the most unconquered,\' but \'the unconquerable.\' English\nidiom, therefore, and common sense required that avi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ata should be\ntranslated, not by inconceived, but by inconceivable, if the translation was\nto be faithful, and was to give to the reader a correct idea of the original.\n\nLet us now examine some other translations, to see whether the translators\nwere satisfied with translating literally, or whether they attempted to\ntranslate thoughtfully.\n\nAnquetil Duperron\'s translation, being in Latin, cannot help us much. He\ntranslates: \'Non auditum, auditum fiat; et non scitum, scitum; et non\ncognitum, cognitum.\'\n\nRajendralal Mitra translates: \'Have you enquired of your tutor about that\nsubject which makes the unheard-of heard, the unconsidered considered, and the\nunsettled settled?\'\n\nHe evidently knew that Brahman was intended, but his rendering of the three\nverbs is not exact.\n\nMr. Gough (p. 43) translates: \'Hast thou asked for that instruction by which\nthe unheard becomes heard, the unthought thought, the unknown known?\'\n\nBut now let us consult a scholar who, in a very marked degree, always was a\nthoughtful translator, who felt a real interest in the subject, and therefore\nwas never satisfied with mere words, however plausible. The late Dr.\nBallantyne, in his translation of the Vedanta-Sara 1, had occasion to\ntranslate this passage from the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad, and how did he\ntranslate it? \'The eulogizing of the subject is the glorifying of what is set\nforth in this or that section (of the Veda); as, for example, in that same\nsection, the sixth chapter of the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad, the glorifying of\nthe Real, besides whom there is nought else, in the following terms: "Thou, O\ndisciple, hast asked for that instruction whereby the unheard-of becomes\nheard, the inconceivable\n\np. xvii\n\nbecomes conceived, and the unknowable becomes thoroughly known."\'\n\nDr. Ballantyne therefore felt exactly what I felt, that in our passage a\nstrictly literal translation would be wrong, would convey no meaning, or a\nwrong meaning; and Mr. Nehemiah Goreh will see that he ought not to express\nblame, without trying to find out whether those whom he blames for want of\nexactness, were not in reality more scrupulously exact in their translation\nthan he has proved himself to be.\n\nMr. Nehemiah Goreh has, no doubt, great advantages in interpreting the\nUpanishads, and when he writes without any theological bias, his remarks are\noften very useful. Thus he objects rightly, I think, to my translation of a\nsentence in the same chapter of the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad, where the father,\nin answer to his son\'s question, replies: \'Sad eva, Somya, idam agra asid ekam\nevadvitiyam.\' I had tried several translations of these words, and yet I see\nnow that the one I proposed in the end is liable to be misunderstood. I had\ntranslated. \'In the beginning, my dear, there was that only which is, one\nonly, without a second.\' The more faithful translation would have been: \'The\nbeing alone was this in the beginning.\' But \'the being\' does not mean in\nEnglish that which is, \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd, and therefore, to avoid any misunderstanding, I\ntranslated \'that which is.\' I might have said, however, \'The existent, the\nreal, the true (satyam) was this in the beginning,\' just as in the Aitareya-\nupanishad we read: \'The Self was all this, one alone, in the beginning 1.\' But\nin that case I should have sacrificed the gender, and this in our passage is\nof great importance, being neuter, and not masculine.\n\nWhat, however, is far more important, and where Mr. Nehemiah Goreh seems to me\nto have quite misapprehended the original Sanskrit, is this, that sat, \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd,\nand atma, the Self, are the subjects in these sentences, and not predicates.\nNow Mr. Nehemiah Goreh translates: \'This was the existent one itself before,\none only without a second;\' and he\n\np. xviii\n\nexplains: \'This universe, before it was developed in the present form, was the\nexistent one, Brahma, itself.\' This cannot be. If \'idam,\' this, i.e. the\nvisible world, were the subject, how could the Upanishad go on and say, tad\naikshata bahu syam pra _g_ ayeyeti tat te _g_ o \'s _ri_ gata, \'that thought,\nmay I be many, may I grow forth. It sent forth fire.\' This can be said of the\nSat only, that is, the Brahman 1. Sat, therefore, is the subject, not idam,\nfor a Vedantist may well say that Brahman is the world, or sent forth the\nworld, but not that the world, which is a mere illusion, was, in the\nbeginning, Brahman.\n\nThis becomes clearer still in another passage, Maitr. Up. VI, 17, where we\nread: Brahma ha va idam agra asid eko \'nanta _h_ , \'In the beginning Brahman\nwas all this. He was one, and infinite.\' Here the transition from the neuter\nto the masculine gender shows that Brahman only can be the subject, both in\nthe first and in the second sentence.\n\nIn English it may seem to make little difference whether we say, \'Brahman was\nthis,\' or \'this was Brahman.\' In Sanskrit too we find, Brahma khalv idam vava\nsarvam, \'Brahman indeed is all this\' (Maitr. Up. IV, 6), and Sarva _m_ khalv\nidam Brahma, \'all this is Brahman indeed\' (Kha _n_ _d_. Up. III, 14, 1). But\nthe logical meaning is always that Brahman was all this, i.e. all that we see\nnow, Brahman being the subject, idam the predicate. Brahman becomes idam, not\nidam Brahman.\n\nThus the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ adasi, I, 18, says:\n\nEkada _s_ endriyair yuktya _s_ astre _n_ apy avagamyate  \nYavat ki _m_ _k_ id bhaved etad ida _m_ _s_ abdodita _m_ _g_ agat,\n\nwhich Mr. A. Venis (Pandit, V, p. 667) translates: \'Whatever may be\napprehended through the eleven organs, by argument and revelation, i.e. the\nworld of phenomena, is expressed by the word idam, this.\' The Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ adasi\nthen goes on:\n\nIda _m_ sarvam pura s _ri_ sh _t_ er ekam evadvitayakam  \nSad evasin namarupe nastam ity \xc3\x82ru _n_ er va _k_ a _h_.\n\nThis Mr. Venis translates: \'Previous to creation, all this\n\np. xix\n\nwas the existent (sat), one only without a second: name and form were\nnot:--this is the declaration of the son of Aru _n_ a.\'\n\nThis is no doubt a translation grammatically correct, but from the\nphilosophical standpoint of the Vedanta, what is really meant is that before\nthe s _ri_ sh _t_ i (which is not creation, but the sending forth of the\nworld, and the sending forth of it, not as something real, but as a mere\nillusion), the Real alone, i.e. the Brahman, was, instead of this, i.e.\ninstead of this illusory world. The illusion was not, but the Real, i.e.\nBrahman, was. What became, or what seemed to change, was Brahman, and\ntherefore the only possible subject, logically, is Brahman, everything else\nbeing a predicate, and a phenomenal predicate only.\n\nIf I were arguing with a European, not with an Indian scholar, I should\nventure to go even a step further, and try to prove that the idam, in this and\nsimilar sentences, does not mean this, i.e. this world, but that originally it\nwas intended as an adverb, meaning now, or here. This use of idam, unsuspected\nby native scholars, is very frequent in Vedic literature, and instances may be\nseen in Boehtlingk\'s Dictionary. In that case the translation would be: \'The\nreal (\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd), O friend, was here in the beginning.\' This meaning of idam,\nhowever, would apply only to the earliest utterances of ancient Brahmavadins,\nwhile in later times idam was used and understood in the sense of all that is\nseen, the visible universe, just as iyam by itself is used in the sense of the\nearth.\n\nHowever, difficulties of this kind may be overcome, if once we have arrived at\na clear conception of the general drift of the Upanishads. The real\ndifficulties are of a very different character. They consist in the\nextraordinary number of passages which seem to us utterly meaningless and\nirrational, or, at all events, so far-fetched that we can hardly believe that\nthe same authors who can express the deepest thoughts on religion and\nphilosophy with clearness, nay, with a kind of poetical eloquence, could have\nuttered in the same breath such utter rubbish. Some of the sacrificial\ntechnicalities, and their philosophical interpretations with which the\nUpanishads abound, may perhaps in time assume a clearer meaning, when we shall\nhave more fully mastered\n\np. xx\n\nthe intricacies of the Vedic ceremonial. But there will always remain in the\nUpanishads a vast amount of what we can only call meaningless jargon, and for\nthe presence of which in these ancient mines of thought I, for my own part,\nfeel quite unable to account. \'Yes,\' a friend of mine wrote to me, after\nreading some of the Sacred Books of the East, \'you are right, how tremendously\nahead of other sacred books is the Bible. The difference strikes one as almost\nunfairly great.\' So it does, no doubt. But some of the most honest believers\nand admirers of the Bible have expressed a similar disappointment, because\nthey had formed their ideas of what a Sacred Book ought to be, theoretically,\nnot historically. The Rev. J. M. Wilson, in his excellent Lectures on the\nTheory of Inspiration, p. 32, writes: \'The Bible is so unlike what you would\nexpect; it does not consist of golden sayings and rules of life; give\nexplanations of the philosophical and social problems of the past, the\npresent, and the future; contain teachings immeasurably unlike those of any\nother book; but it contains history, ritual, legislation, poetry, dialogue,\nprophecy, memoirs, and letters; it contains much that is foreign to your idea\nof what a revelation ought to be. But this is not all. There is not only much\nthat is foreign, but much that is opposed, to your preconceptions. The Jews\ntolerated slavery, polygamy, and other customs and cruelties of imperfect\ncivilisation. There are the vindictive psalms, too, with their bitter hatred\nagainst enemies,--psalms which we chant in our churches. How can we do so?\nThere are stories of immorality, of treachery, of crime. How can we read\nthem?\' Still the Bible has been and is a truly sacred, because a truly\nhistorical book, for there is nothing more sacred in this world than the\nhistory of man, in his search after his highest ideals. All ancient books\nwhich have once been called sacred by man, will have their lasting place in\nthe history of mankind, and those who possess the courage, the perseverance,\nand the self-denial of the true miner, and of the true scholar, will find even\nin the darkest and dustiest shafts what they are seeking for,--real nuggets of\nthought, and precious jewels of faith and hope.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[ix:1](sbe15002.htm#fr_0) See Deussen, Vedanta, Einleitung, p. 38. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara\noccasionally refers also to the Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gi, Agnirahasya, _G_ abala, and Naraya _n_\niya Upanishads.\n\n[ix:2](sbe15002.htm#fr_1) Deussen, loc. cit. p. 82.\n\n[ix:3](sbe15002.htm#fr_2) I state this on the authority of Professor Cowell.\nSee also Fitzedward Hall, Index to the Bibliography of the Indian\nPhilosophical Systems, pp. 116 and 236.\n\n[x:1](sbe15002.htm#fr_3) They have been published by Dr. Roer in the\nBibliotheca Indica.\n\n[x:2](sbe15002.htm#fr_4) Dr. Weber\'s statement that _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara wrote a\ncommentary on the Kaushitaki-upanishad has been corrected by Deussen, loc.\ncit. p. 39.\n\n[x:3](sbe15002.htm#fr_5) See Deussen, loc. cit. p. 39.\n\n[x:4](sbe15002.htm#fr_6) A long list of works ascribed to _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara may be\nseen in Regnaud, Philosophie de l\'Inde, p. 34, chiefly taken from Fitzedward\nHall\'s Index of Indian Philosophical Systems.\n\n[x:5](sbe15002.htm#fr_7) See Tarkaratna\'s Vig\xc3\xb1apana, p. 3, l. 5.\n\n[xii:1](sbe15002.htm#fr_8) India, What can it teach us? p. 360.\n\n[xiv:1](sbe15002.htm#fr_9) Mr. Nehemiah Goreh writes aprakshyo, and this is no\ndoubt the reading adopted by Roer in his edition of the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad\nin the Bibliotheca Indica, p. 384.
