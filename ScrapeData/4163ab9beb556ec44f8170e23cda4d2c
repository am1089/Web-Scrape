From the year to Vayu; on account of the absence and presence of\nspecification.\n\nBut by what special combination can we establish between\n\np. 385\n\nthe different attributes of the road the relation of what is determined by\nattributes and of determining attributes? The teacher out of kindness to us\nconnects them as follows.--The Kaushitakins describe the road of the gods as\nfollows, 'Having reached the path of the gods he comes to the world of Agni,\nto the world of Vayu, to the world of Varu _n_ a, to the world of Indra, to\nthe world of Pra _g_ apati, to the world of Brahman' (Kau. Up. I, 3). Now the\nworld of Agni means the same as light, since both terms denote burning, and we\ntherefore need not, with regard to them, search for the order in which they\nare to be combined. Vayu, on the other hand, is not mentioned in the road\nbeginning with light; in what place then is he to be inserted?--We read, Kh.\nUp. V, 10, 1, 'They go to the light, from light to day, from day to the waxing\nhalf of the moon, from the waxing half of the moon to the six months when the\nsun goes to the north, from those months to the year, from the year to\n\xc3\x82ditya.' Here they reach Vayu after the year and before \xc3\x82ditya.--Why so?--'On\naccount of the absence and presence of specification.' About Vayu--concerning\nwhom the passage, 'He goes to the world of Vayu,' contains no specification--\nanother passage does state such a specification, viz. B _ri_. Up. V, 10, 1,\n'When the person goes away from this world he comes to Vayu. Then Vayu makes\nroom for him like the hole of a wheel. and through it he mounts higher, he\ncomes to \xc3\x82ditya.' On account of this specification which shows Vayu to come\nbefore \xc3\x82ditya, Vayu must be inserted between the year and \xc3\x82ditya.--But as\nthere is a specification showing that Vayu comes after Agni, why is he not\ninserted after the light?--There is no such specification, we reply.--But a\nscriptural passage has been quoted which runs as follows, 'Having reached the\npath of the gods he comes to the world of Agni, to the world of Vayu.'--In\nthat passage, we reply, we have only two clauses, of which the text exhibits\none before the other, but there is no word expressing order of succession. We\nhave there only a simple statement of facts, 'He goes to this and to that.'\nBut in the other text we perceive a regular order of succession;\n\np. 386\n\nfor it intimates that after having mounted on high through an opening as large\nas the wheel of a chariot, granted by Vayu, he approaches the sun. The Sutra\ntherefore rightly says, 'On account of the absence and presence of\nspecification.'--The Va _g_ asaneyins in their text record that he proceeds\n'from the months to the world of the gods, from the world of the gods to the\nsun' (B _ri_. Up. VI, 2, 15). Here, in order to maintain the immediate\nsuccession of Vayu and \xc3\x82ditya, we must suppose the souls to go from the world\nof the gods to Vayu. What the Sutra says about the soul going to Vayu from the\nyear has reference to the text of the _Kh_ andogya. As between the Va _g_\nasaneyaka and the _Kh_ andogya, the world of the gods is absent from one, the\nyear from the other. As both texts are authoritative, both stages have to be\ninserted in each, and the distinction has to be made that, owing to its\nconnexion with the months, the year has the first place (i.e. after the months\nand before the world of the gods), and the world of the gods the second place.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 3](sbe38304.htm)\n\n"
