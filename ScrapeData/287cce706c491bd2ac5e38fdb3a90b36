Suta said :-- \xc2\x93O Ri _s_ is! In days of yore, from the Lotus Face of the\nDevi Bhagavata came out S\xc2\x92ri Mad Bhagavatam in the form of half a S\xc2\x92loka, as\nthe decided conclusion of the Vedas. About what She gave instructions to Vi\n_sn_ u, sleeping on a leaf of a Banyan tree, that same thing, the seed of the\nS\xc2\x92ri Mad Bhagavata, Brahma Himself expanded into\n\n\n\np. 1191\n\n\n\none hundred Ko _t_ i s\xc2\x92lokas. Then, Veda Vyasa, in order to teach his own son\nS\xc2\x92uka Deva, condensed them into eighteen thousand s\xc2\x92lokas, in Twelve Books and\nnamed it S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the present volume. That voluminous book\ncomprising one hundred Ko _t_ i s\xc2\x92lokas compiled by Brahma are still extant in\nthe Deva loka. There is no Pura _n_ a like the Devi Bhagavatam, so merit-\ngiving, holy and capable to destroy all the sins. The reading of every line\nyields the fruits of performing many As\xc2\x92vamedha sacrifices. Human beings\naddicted to worldly affairs will get the merit of giving lands to the Brahma\n_n_ as and they will enjoy also all the pleasures of the world and in the end\nwill go to the region of the Devi, if they can hear, after they have fasted\nand controlled their passions, the recitation of this Pura _n_ am from the\nmouth of a Paura _n_ ik Brahma _n_ a, who has been worshipped and given\nclothings and ornaments and is considered as a second Veda Vyasa. Or, if\nanybody writes the whole of the Devi Bhagavatam with his own hand or gets it\nwritten by a writer from the beginning to the end and gives to a Paura _n_ ik\nBrahmi _n_ the book placed in a box of the form of a lion made up of gold and\na cow yielding milk with her calf with gold as his sacrificial fee; or if he\nfeeds as many Brahma _n_ as as there are the number of chapters of the Devi\nBhagavatam and worship as many Kumaris (virgin girls) with saffron,\nsandalpaste and ornaments and feeds them with Paysanna, he gets the merits of\ngiving lands and enjoys all the pleasures of the world and goes in the end to\nthe region of the Devi. He has no want of anything who daily hears with rapt\ndevotion this Devi Bhagavatam. One who has no wealth gets abundance of wealth,\nthose who are students get knowledge, one who has no sons, gets sons if one\nhears this Devi Bhagavatam with true devotion. A barren woman, or one who\nbears still-born children or whose offsprings never live long or who bears\nonly a single child, gets all her defects removed, if she hears this Devi\nBhagavatam with a steadfast devotion. The house where this Pura _n_ a is\nworshipped, Lak _s_ mi and Sarasvati dwell there, leaving their animosities\ntowards each other. By the influence of this Devi Bhagavatam the Dakinis,\nVetalas, Rak _s_ asas, and other ghosts cannot cast a glance even on its\ndevotee. If anybody gets fever and if the S\xc2\x92ri Devi Bhagavatam be read\ntouching him with a concentrated attention, all the complaints disappear. By\nreading this Bhagavatam, one hundred times even more difficult than the severe\ndisease pthisis is cured.\n\n\n\n18-20. If after performing the Sandhya, one reads only one chapter of this\nBhagavatam with a collected mind, he soon acquires the Real Knowledge. O Muni\nS\xc2\x92aunaka! While going to read this Bhagavatam, first examine omens and then\nread. I have spoken already on this subject. If during the S\xc2\x92aradiya Puja (the\nautumnal Durga Puja), at the\n\n\n\np. 1192\n\n\n\nNavaratra period, one reads with devotion this Bhagavatam, the Devi Bhagavati\nbecomes greatly pleased and awards him results more than his desires.\n\n\n\n21-31. During the Navaratri period all can read well this book for the\nsatisfaction of his \xc3\x8e _st_ a Deva (his own deity) whether he be a Vai _sn_\nava, S\xc2\x92aiva, Saura, Ga _n_ apatya or a S\xc2\x92akta. All can read this for the\nsatisfaction of Lak _s_ mi, Uma and other S\xc2\x92aktis. The Vaidik Brahma _n_ as\nare to recite this daily for the satisfaction of the Devi Gayatri. This Pura\n_n_ am is not contradictory to any sectarian belief. The reason of this being\nthat to whatever deity he pays his worship, he must worship some S\xc2\x92akti or\nother, this is stated everywhere. So for the satisfaction of one\xc2\x92s own S\xc2\x92akti,\nall can read this, without contradicting each other. Never any woman nor any\nS\xc2\x92udra, is to read this herself or himself, even out of ignorance; rather they\nshould hear this from the mouth of a Brahma _n_ a. This is the rule of the\nS\xc2\x92astras. (The vibrations and the consequent results would be truer then.) O\nRi _s_ is! What more to say on this book than this, that this Pura _n_ am is\nthe most excellent of all and yields great merits. It is the essence of the\nVedas. This I tell you with great certainty. There is not the least doubt in\nthis. Reading or hearing this yields results equivalent to reading or hearing\nthe Vedas. I now bow to the Devi of the nature of Hrim and established by\nGayatri, of the nature of Everlasting Existence, Intelligence and Bliss, Who\nstimulates our activities to the understanding of various subjects. Thus\nhearing the excellent words of Suta, the great Paura _n_ ik, all the Munis of\nNaimi _s_ ara _n_ ya worshipped him specially and as the result of hearing\nthis Pura _n_ am glady became the servants of the Lotus Feet of the Devi and\nthey attained the Highest Rest. The Munis expressed their humility and\ngratitude to Suta frequently and bowed down to him again and again. And they\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O Suta! It is you that have saved us from this ocean of world.\xc2\x94 Thus\n(the great Bhagavata) Suta, the bee drinking the honey of the Lotus Feet of\nthe Devi, recited before the assemblage of the best of the Munis this Pura _n_\nam from the beginning to the end, the Secret of all the Nigamas and full of\nthe Glories of the Devi Bhagavati. After this the Ri _s_ is bowed down to him\nand he blessed and honoured them.\n\n\n\nThen he went away to his desired place. Here the Devi Bhagavatam ends and is\nfully completed.\n\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourteenth Chapter of the Twelfth Book on the recitation of the\nfruits of this Pura _n_ am in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\nHere ends as well the Full Treatise, S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam.\n\nO _m_. O _m_. O _m_. O _m_ Tat Sat. O _m_ Hari O _m_.\n\n\n\n'
