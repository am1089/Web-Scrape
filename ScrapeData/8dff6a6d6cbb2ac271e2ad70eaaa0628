He causes her, after she has bathed and put on a (new) garment which has\nnot yet been washed, to sit down behind the fire.\n\n3\\. He sacrifices, while she takes hold of him, with the Mahavyah _ri_ tis.\n\n4\\. He cooks a mess of food,\n\n5\\. According to some (teachers) boiled rice with Mudga beans.\n\n6\\. The implements used and the Nakshatra should be of male gender.\n\n7\\. (He then sacrifices with the following texts,) 'May Dhatar give to his\nworshipper further life and safety; may we obtain the favour of the god whose\nlaws are truthful.\n\n'Dhatar disposes of offspring and wealth; Dhatar has created this whole world;\nDhatar will give a\n\np. 48\n\nson to the sacrificer: to him you shall sacrifice, an offering rich in ghee.'\n\n(Besides) with the three verses, 'Ne _g_ amesha, fly away' (Rig-veda Khailika\nsukta, after X, 184, vol. vi, p. 31), and in the sixth place the verse, 'Pra\n_g_ apati' (Rig-veda X, 121, 10).\n\n8 8.

Comp. above, chap. 12, 6.\n\n[48:10](sbe29024.htm#fr_100) Naraya _n_ a: tis _ri_ bhis tantubhir v _ri_ tte\nsutre udumbaraphalani . . . gale . . . badhnati. I have translated\naccordingly. Paraskara I, 15, 6 uses the same expression triv _ri_ t.\nProfessor Stenzler there translates it, on the authority of _G_ ayarama,\n'dreifache Haarflechte,' and says in his note on that passage that, according\nto _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, he would have to tie the things with a threefold string to\nthe neck of the woman, as if _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana's statement were different from\nthat of Paraskara. But both authors have the same word, and only the\ncommentators differ in their explanations thereof.\n\n[48:11](sbe29024.htm#fr_101) \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana more explicitly says (I, 14, 6),\nSoma _m_ ra _g_ ana _m_ sa _m_ gayetam iti.\n\n[48:13](sbe29024.htm#fr_102) In my German translation there is a mistake which\nshould be corrected. I have there referred shal _ri_ _k_ a to the verses Rakam\np. 79 aham, which are actually only five in number. The six verses are Vish\n_n_ ur yonim, &c., and the five verses mentioned.\n\n[49:15](sbe29024.htm#fr_103) Va _g_ asaneyi Sa _m_ hita XII, 4.\n\n[49:16-17](sbe29024.htm#fr_104) 16, 17.
