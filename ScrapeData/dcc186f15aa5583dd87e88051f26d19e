Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said: what is the extent of the world of Yama? What is it like? By\nwhom was it made? What is the assembly like, and with whom does Justice\nreside?\n\nThe righteous go by righteous ways to the mansion of Justice; tell me about\nthose righteous ones and the ways, O Treasure-house of Compassion.\n\n3-5. The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, I will tell you about that\nshining city of Justice, which is accessible to N\xc4\x81rada and others find is\nreached by the very meritorious.\n\nBetween the south and south-west is the city of the son of Vivaswata, all\nbuilt of diamonds, resplendent, impregnable by Holy Ones or Demons.\n\nIt is declared to be four-angled, with four gateways, surrounded by high\nramparts and measuring a thousand yojanas.\n\np. 131\n\n6-9. In that city is the very lovely dwelling of Chitragupta, which extends to\nthe number of twenty-five yojanas,\n\nSurrounded with shining ramparts of iron, up to ten [yojanas] heights, with\nhundreds of streets decorated with flags and banners,\n\nAbounding in chariots, resounding with songs and music, decorated by skilful\npainters and constructed by divine architects,\n\nBeautiful with gardens and parks, and sounding with the songs of various\nbirds; habited in every part by celestial damsels and choristers.\n\n10-15. Chitragupta, seated on his most wonderful throne in that assembly,\nconsiders the lives of men individually.\n\nHe is never mistaken in distinguishing between good and evil deeds, or by whom\ngood or evil deeds have been done\n\nAnd by order of Chitragupta he experiences all of them there. To the east of\nthe abode of Chitragupta is the great house of Fever.\n\nTo the south are those of Rheumatism and skin diseases, and smallpox likewise.\nTo the west are those of the Snare of Death, Dyspepsia, and Biliousness also.\n\nTo the north there is consumption and Jaundice likewise; to the north-west,\nHeadache; to the south-east, Syncope.\n\nTo the south-west, is Dysentery; to the north-west cold and heat--with these\nand other diseases it is [surrounded](errata.htm#17).\n\np. 132\n\n16-23. Chitragupta records the good and evil of men. Twenty yojanas before the\nabode of Chitragupta,\n\nIn the [middle](errata.htm#18) of the city, is the very resplendent mansion of\nthe king of justice. It is shining with jewels, and splendid like lightning,\nflame and the sun.\n\nIt is certainly two hundred yojanas in extent, and measures fifty yojanas in\nheight.\n\nIt is supported by thousands of pillars, decorated with emeralds, ornamented\nwith gold, and is full of palaces and mansions,\n\nPleasing to the mind with cupolas of the splendour of the autumnal sky; with\nbeautiful crystal stairways and walls beautified with diamonds,\n\nAnd with windows of strings of pearls, decorated with flags and banners; rich\nwith the sounds of bells and drums; and embellished with golden fringes,\n\nFilled with various wonders; with hundreds of golden doors;\n[beautiful](errata.htm#19) with trees, plants and creepers without thorns.\n\nWith these and other embellishments decorated always--it was created by the\narchitect of the Universe by the power of his own Yoga.\n\np. 133\n\n24-28. In that there is a divine assembly place which is a thousand yojanas in\nextent, splendid like the sun, full of light, and in every way satisfying; 1\n\nWith no extreme heat and no extreme cold; most ravishing to the mind with no\nsorrows and no old age there, and no trouble of hunger and thirst.\n\nAll there are in a condition of happiness, whether they be human or divine;\nthe eatables are tasteful and plentiful, and enjoyable in every way.\n\nThe water, both hot and cold, are sweet; the sounds and other things there are\npleasant; and trees always bear the fruit desired.\n\nThat assembly, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, has no bondage, is enchanting, is a fulfiller of\ndesires, and was created by the Architect of the Universe by doing tapas 2 for\na long time.\n\n29-30. Those who have done great tapas, are of good vows, truth-speaking,\ntranquil, renouncing, accomplished, and purified by good actions go there.\n\nAll there have bodies of light, and are adorned with shining garments, and\nremain there ornamented with their own meritorious actions.\n\n31-33. There the Lord of Justice, on a throne pure and incomparable, ten\nyojanas in extent, bedecked with all kinds of jewels--\n\nSits, the Best of the Good, his head dignified with the regal umbrella,\nornamented with ear-rings, prosperous, made splendid with a large crown.\n\nAdorned with all ornaments, splendid as a blue cloud, and fanned by celestial\ndamsels bearing in their hands fans of hair.\n\np. 134\n\n34-40. Multitudes of celestial choristers and numerous groups of celestial\ndamsels, round about, serve him with songs, music and dances.\n\nHe is waited up by M\xe1\xb9\x9bityu 1 with a noose in his hand, by k\xc4\x81la 1 still more\npowerful, and by Chitragupta, the recorder of fate,\n\nSurrounded by various servants equal to him in prowess, bearing awful nooses\nand rods, ready to do his bidding,\n\nWho are the Agni\xe1\xb9\xa3v\xc4\x81ttha, Pit\xe1\xb9\x9bis, 2 the Somap\xc4\x81s and the U\xe1\xb9\xa3map\xc4\x81s, the powerful\nBarhi\xe1\xb9\xa3ads formed and formless, O Bird,\n\nAryam\xc4\x81s and others, hosts of progenitors, and others having forms,--all these\nwait upon the King of Justice, with the sages:\n\nAtri, Va\xc5\x9bi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\xadha, Pulaha, Dak\xe1\xb9\xa3a, Kraturatha, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, J\xc4\x81madagnya, and also\nBh\xe1\xb9\x9bigu, Pulastya, Agastya, N\xc4\x81rada,--\n\nThese, and many others in the assembly of the King of Progenitors, impossible\nto enumerate, either by their names or their deeds.\n\np. 135\n\n41-45. Those who expound with accurate commentaries, the Dharma\xc5\x9b\xc4\x81stras, 1\nserve the King of Justice by order of Parame\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\xadhin. 2\n\nThe kings of the Solar Race, also of the Lunar Race,--these knowers of\nrighteousness wait upon the King of Justice in the assembly.\n\nManu, Dil\xc4\xabpa, M\xc4\x81ndh\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81, Sagara, Bhag\xc4\xabratha, Ambar\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xa3a, Anara\xe1\xb9\x87ya, Muchakunda,\nNimi, and P\xe1\xb9\x9bithu,\n\nYay\xc4\x81ti, Nahu\xe1\xb9\xa3a, Puru; Du\xe1\xb9\xa3manta, \xc5\x9aibi, Nala, Bharata, \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81nta\xe1\xb9\x87u, P\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87du, and also\nSahasr\xc4\x81rjuna,--\n\nThese royal sages, meritorious, famous, well-read in the Vedas, having\nperformed many horse sacrifices, are in the assembly of Righteousness.\n\n46-47. Righteousness alone prevails in the assembly of the King of Justice.\nThere is there no favouritism, no untruthfulness, and no jealousy.\n\nAll those assembled are knowers of the scriptures; all are devoted to\nrighteousness; and in that assembly they continually wait upon Vaivasvata 3\n\n48-49. Such, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, is the assembly of the great-souled King of Justice.\nThe sinners, who go by the southern path, do not behold it.\n\nThere are four ways leading into the city of the King of Justice: The way for\nthe sinful has already been described to you.\n\n50\\. Those who go into the mansion of righteousness by the three gateways,\neastern and others, are those of good deeds. By their merits they go into it.\nHear about them:--\n\np. 136\n\n51-55. There is an eastern way, abounding in all enjoyments, covered with the\nshade of P\xc4\x81rij\xc4\x81ta trees, and paved with jewels,\n\nBusy with numerous chariots; splendidly lined with swans, bounded by trees and\npleasure-gardens, having the essence of nectar.\n\nBy that go the holy Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87-sages, the stainless royal sages, and multitudes\nof celestial damsels, choristers, magicians and great serpents,\n\nAnd worshippers of the deities, and the devotees of \xc5\x9aiva, those who give rest-\nhouses in the summer, and who give fuel in winter,\n\nThose who shelter ascetics 1 in their houses during the rains, and make them\ngifts; those who speak consolation to the mentally distressed, and certainly\nthose who give a hermitage,\n\nAnd those who delight in truth and righteousness; those free from anger and\ngreed; those devoted to father and mother, those taking pleasure in the\nservice of their Teacher.\n\nThose who make gifts of land, of houses, of cows; those who impart learning;\nthose who tell and listen to the Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as;--are travellers on the path--\n\nThese, and others of good deeds, enter by the eastern gate. Skilful in\ngoodness, and of purified intelligence, they go to the Assembly of\nRighteousness.\n\np. 137\n\n59-61. The second, the northern way, is filled with hundreds of great chariots\nand with palanquins, and is paved with yellow sandal-wood;\n\nIt is full of swans and water-fowl, and beautiful with Br\xc4\x81hmany ducks, and\nthere is there a delightful tank full of the essence of nectar.\n\nOn this way go those who are learned in the Vedas, also those who honour\nguests, those who are worshippers of D\xc5\xabrg\xc4\x81 1 and Bhanu, 2 and those who bathe\nat the sacred waters at the changes of the moon,\n\nThose who die in the pursuit of righteousness, and those who die of vow of\nstarvation, those who die in Benares, those who die in the protection of\ncattle, those who are accidentally drowned in the sacred waters;\n\nThose who die for the sake of Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s, in the service of the master, at the\nsacred waters and on holy ground, by the will of the Shining Ones; those who\ndie in the practice of Yoga;\n\nThose who always honour the deserving, and those who delight in making great\ngifts,--these, entering by the northern gate, reach the Assembly of\nRighteousness.\n\np. 138\n\n65-73. The third, the western way, is beautified with jewelled mansions, and\nsplendid with ponds, always filled with the essence of nectar,\n\nIs filled with maddened elephants sprung of the family of Air\xc4\x81vata 1 and with\njewels of horses sprung from Uchchai\xe1\xb8\xa5\xc5\x9brav\xc4\x81. 2\n\nBy this way go the self-reliant, those who contemplate the good scriptures,\nthose entirely devoted to Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u, those who repeat the G\xc4\x81yatr\xc4\xab-mantra,\n\nThose who turn away from injury to others, from the wealth of others, and from\ncalumny; those faithful to their wives; the good; those who maintain household\nfires; those who repeat the Vedas;\n\nObservers of the vow of celibacy; forest dwellers; the austere; devotees of\nthe feet of \xc5\x9ar\xc4\xab; those intent upon renunciation; those who look equally upon\ngold, stone and earth;\n\nThose who have attained knowledge and dispassion; those intent upon the\nwelfare of all beings; those who keep vows to \xc5\x9aiva and Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u; those who\nperform the rites of Brahm\xc4\x81,\n\nThose who are rid of the three-fold debt; those who always take pleasure in\nthe five sacrifices; those who perform \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha for the forefathers; those who\nperform the Sandhy\xc4\x81 at the proper times;\n\nThose who abstain from the company of the wicked, devoted to the society of\nthe good;--these, accompanied by numbers of celestial damsels, ascend the best\nof chariots.\n\nThey drink nectar, and go to the mansion of righteousness, and entering by the\nwestern gate, go to the Assembly of Righteousness.\n\np. 139\n\n74-76. Yama, seeing them come, rising and coming forward, repeatedly bids them\nwelcome.\n\nThen, assuming his four arms, holding his conch, discus, mace and sword, he\nspeaks and acts in a hind and friendly way to those who delight in meritorious\ndeeds.\n\nHe offers them the throne, and bows to them; washes their feet, and then\nhonours them with sandal-paste and other things.\n\n77-81. "O\' You Assembled! Salute with deepest reverence the knower. He,\ndeparting from my dominion, will go to the world of Brahm\xc4\x81.\n\n"O, Best of the Wise, who avoid the pains of hell; you have by your merits\nattained divinity, the state of happiness.\n\n"He who, attaining the human state, difficult to reach, never acts wisely, he\ngoes to a dreadful hell. Who is more foolish than he?\n\n"He who, in the impermanent body, amid perishable wealth and other things,\nstores up unchanging righteousness, he alone is a wise man. "Therefore should\nrighteousness be accumulated, with every effort.\n\nGo you to the holy place which abounds in all enjoyments."\n\np. 140\n\n82-85. They, having heard the words of Justice, and having saluted him and the\nassembly, and being honoured by the immortals and extolled by the leaders of\nthe sages,\n\nGo along the highest path, accompanied by multitudes of chariots; then those\nin that assembly of righteousness rise up with great respect\n\nHaving spent there 1 some ages, and enjoyed superhuman pleasures, they obtain,\nas a result of their merits, holy human birth,\n\nWealthy and wise, expert in all the scriptures. Then again they go to the\nhighest condition by their own good conduct.\n\n86\\. All this about the abode of Yama has been told you upon your asking. The\nman who hears this with devotion goes to the assembly of the King of Justice.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[133:1](gpu16.htm#fr_144) Taking any form desired.\n\n[133:2](gpu16.htm#fr_145) Meditation with an effort to produce physical\neffects.\n\n[134:1](gpu16.htm#fr_147) Forms of Death.\n\n[134:2](gpu16.htm#fr_148) A class of progenitors.\n\n[135:1](gpu16.htm#fr_149) Scriptures teaching the duties of life.\n\n[135:2](gpu16.htm#fr_150) Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87.\n\n[135:3](gpu16.htm#fr_151) Yama, the son of Visvasvat.\n\n[136:1](gpu16.htm#fr_152) Those who have renounced the world.\n\n[137:1](gpu16.htm#fr_153) The consort of \xc5\x9aiva.\n\n[137:2](gpu16.htm#fr_154) The Sun.\n\n[138:1](gpu16.htm#fr_155) The divine elephant.\n\n[138:2](gpu16.htm#fr_156) The divine horse.\n\n[140:1](gpu16.htm#fr_157) That is in Heaven world.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XV.
