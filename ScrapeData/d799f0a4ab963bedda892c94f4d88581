Such is the charm of deciphering step by step\nthe dark and helpless utterances of the early poets of India, and discovering\nfrom time to time behind words that for years seemed unintelligible, the\nsimple though strange expressions of primitive thought and primitive faith,\nthat it required no small amount of self-denial to decide in favour of\ndevoting a life to the publishing of the materials rather than to the drawing\nof the results which those materials supply to the student of ancient language\nand ancient religion. Even five and twenty years ago, and without waiting for\nthe publication of Saya _n_ a's commentary, much might have been achieved in\nthe interpretation of the hymns of the Rig-veda. With the MSS. then accessible\nin the principal libraries of Europe, a tolerably correct text of the Sa _m_\nhita might have been published, and these ancient relics of a primitive\nreligion might have been at least partially deciphered and translated in the\nsame way in which ancient inscriptions are deciphered and translated, viz. by\na careful collection of all grammatical forms, and by a complete\nintercomparison of all passages in which the same words and the same phrases\noccur. When I resolved to devote my leisure to a critical edition of the text\nand commentary of the Rig-veda rather than to an independent study of that\ntext, it was chiefly from a conviction that the traditional interpretation of\nthe Rig-veda, as embodied in the commentary of Saya _n_ a and other works of a\nsimilar\n\np. xxx\n\ncharacter, could not be neglected with impunity, and that sooner or later a\ncomplete edition of these works would be recognised as a necessity. It was\nbetter therefore to begin with the beginning, though it seemed hard sometimes\nto spend forty years in the wilderness instead of rushing straight into the\npromised land.\n\nIt is well known to those who have followed my literary publications that I\nnever entertained any exaggerated opinion as to the value of the traditional\ninterpretation of the Veda, handed down in the theological schools of India,\nand preserved to us in the great commentary of Saya _n_ a. More than twenty\nyears ago, when it required more courage to speak out than now, I expressed my\nopinion on that subject in no ambiguous language, and was blamed for it by\nsome of those who now speak of Saya _n_ a as a mere drag in the progress of\nVedic scholarship. Even a drag, however, is sometimes more conducive to the\nsafe advancement of learning than a whip; and those who recollect the history\nof Vedic scholarship during the last five and twenty years, know best that,\nwith all its faults and weaknesses, Saya _n_ a's commentary was a sine qua non\nfor a scholarlike study of the Rig-veda. I do not wonder that others who have\nmore recently entered on that study are inclined to speak disparagingly of the\nscholastic interpretations of Saya _n_ a. They hardly know how much we all owe\nto his guidance in effecting our first entrance into this fortress of Vedic\nlanguage and Vedic religion, and how much even they, without being aware of\nit, are indebted to that Indian Eustathius. I do not withdraw an opinion which\nI expressed many years ago, and for which I was much blamed at the time, that\nSaya _n_ a in many cases teaches us how the Veda ought not to be, rather than\nhow it ought to be understood. But for all that, who does not know how much\nassistance may be derived from a first translation, even though it is\nimperfect, nay, how often the very mistakes of our predecessors help us in\nfinding the right track? If now we can walk without Saya _n_ a, we ought to\nbear in mind that five and twenty years ago we could not have made even our\nfirst steps, we could never, at least, have gained a firm\n\np. xxxi\n\nfooting without his leading strings. If therefore we can now see further than\nhe could, let us not forget that we are standing on his shoulders.\n\nI do not regret in the least the time which I have devoted to the somewhat\ntedious work of editing the commentary of Saya _n_ a, and editing it according\nto the strictest rules of critical scholarship. The Veda, I feel convinced,\nwill occupy scholars for centuries to come, and will take and maintain for\never its position as the most ancient of books in the library of mankind. Such\na book, and the commentary of such a book, should be edited once for all; and\nunless some unexpected discovery is made of more ancient MSS., I do not\nanticipate that any future Bekker or Dindorf will find much to glean for a new\nedition of Saya _n_ a, or that the text, as restored by me from a collation of\nthe best MSS. accessible in Europe, will ever be materially shaken a. It has\ntaken a long time, I know; but those who find fault with me for the delay,\nshould remember that few\n\np. xxxii\n\nscholars, if any, have worked for others more than I have done in copying and\nediting Sanskrit texts, and that after all one cannot give up the whole of\none's life to the collation of Oriental MSS. and the correction of proof-\nsheets. The two concluding volumes have long been ready for Press, and as soon\nas I can find leisure, they too shall be printed and published a.\n\nIn now venturing to publish the first volume of my translation of the Rig-\nveda, I am fully aware that the fate which awaits it will be very different\nfrom that of my edition of the text and commentary. It is a mere contribution\ntowards a better understanding of the Vedic hymns, and though I hope it may\ngive in the main a right rendering of the sense of the Vedic poets, I feel\nconvinced that on many points my translation is liable to correction, and will\nsooner or later be replaced by a more satisfactory one. It is difficult to\nexplain to those who have not themselves worked at the Veda, how it is that,\nthough we may understand almost every word, yet we find it so difficult to lay\nhold of a whole chain of connected thought, and to discover expressions that\nwill not throw a wrong shade on the original features of the ancient words of\nthe Veda. We have, on the one hand, to avoid giving to our translations too\nmodern a character, or paraphrasing instead of translating; while, on the\nother, we cannot retain expressions which, if literally rendered in English or\nany modern tongue, would have an air of quaintness or absurdity totally\nforeign to the intention of the ancient poets. There are, as all Vedic\nscholars know, whole verses which, as yet, yield no sense whatever. There are\nwords the meaning of\n\np. xxxiii\n\nwhich we can only guess. Here, no doubt, a continued study will remove some of\nour difficulties, and many a passage that is now dark, will receive light\nhereafter from a happy combination. Much has already been achieved by the\nefforts of European scholars, but much more remains to be done; and our only\nchance of seeing any rapid progress made lies, I believe, in communicating\nfreely what every one has found out by himself, and not minding if others\npoint out to us that we have overlooked the very passage that would at once\nhave solved our difficulties, that our conjectures were unnecessary, and our\nemendations wrong. True and honest scholars whose conscience tells them that\nthey have done their best, and who care for the subject on which they are\nengaged far more than for the praise of benevolent or the blame of malignant\ncritics, ought not to take any notice of merely frivolous censure. There are\nmistakes, no doubt, of which we ought to be ashamed, and for which the only\namende honorable we can make is to openly confess and retract them. But there\nare others, particularly in a subject like Vedic interpretation, which we\nshould forgive, as we wish to be forgiven. This can be done without lowering\nthe standard of true scholarship or vitiating the healthy tone of scientific\nmorality. Kindness and gentleness are not incompatible with earnestness,--far\nfrom it!--and where these elements are wanting, not only is the joy embittered\nwhich is the inherent reward of all bona fide work, but selfishness,\nmalignity, aye, even untruthfulness, gain the upper hand, and the healthy\ngrowth of science is stunted. While in my translation of the Veda and in the\nremarks that I have to make in the course of my commentary, I shall frequently\ndiffer from other scholars, I hope I shall never say an unkind word of men who\nhave done their best, and who have done what they have done in a truly\nscholarlike, that is, in a humble spirit. It would be unpleasant, even were it\npossible within the limits assigned, to criticise every opinion that has been\nput forward on the meaning of certain words or on the construction of certain\nverses of the Veda. I prefer, as much as possible, to vindicate my own\ntranslation, instead of\n\np. xxxiv\n\nexamining the translations of other scholars, whether Indian or European. Saya\n_n_ a's translation, as rendered into English by Professor Wilson, is before\nthe world. Let those who take an interest in these matters compare it with the\ntranslation here proposed. In order to give readers who do not possess that\ntranslation, an opportunity of comparing it with my own, I have for a few\nhymns printed that as well as the translations of Langlois and Benfey a on the\nsame page with my own. Everybody will thus be enabled to judge of the peculiar\ncharacter of each of these translations. That of Saya _n_ a represents the\ntradition of India; that of Langlois is the ingenious, but thoroughly\nuncritical, guesswork of a man of taste; that of Benfey is the rendering of a\nscholar, who has carefully worked out the history of some words, but who\nassigns to other words either the traditional meaning recorded by Saya _n_ a,\nor a conjectural meaning which, however, would not always stand the test of an\ninter-comparison of all passages in which these words occur. I may say, in\ngeneral, that Saya _n_ a's translation was of great use to me in the\nbeginning, though it seldom afforded help for the really difficult passages.\nLanglois' translation has hardly ever yielded real assistance, while I\nsincerely regret that Benfey's rendering does not extend beyond the first Ma\n_n_ _d_ ala.\n\nIt may sound self-contradictory, if, after confessing the help which I derived\nfrom these translations, I venture to The first traduction raisonnee.call my\nown the first translation of the Rig-veda. The word translation, however, has\nmany meanings. I mean by translation, not a mere rendering of the hymns of the\nRig-veda into English, French, or German, but a full account of the reasons\nwhich justify the translator in assigning such a power to such a word, and\nsuch a meaning to such a sentence. I mean by translation a real deciphering, a\nwork like that which Burnouf performed in his first attempts at a translation\nof the Avesta,--a traduction raisonnee, if such an expression may be used.\nWithout such a process,\n\np. xxxv\n\nwithout a running commentary, a mere translation of the ancient hymns of the\nBrahmans will never lead to any solid results. Even if the translator has\ndiscovered the right meaning of a word or of a whole sentence, his mere\ntranslation does not help us much, unless he shows us the process by which he\nhas arrived at it, unless he places before us the pieces justificatives of his\nfinal judgment. The Veda teems with words that require a justification; not so\nmuch the words which occur but once or twice, though many of these are\ndifficult enough, but rather the common words and particles, which occur again\nand again, which we understand to a certain point, and can render in a vague\nway, but which must be defined before they can be translated, and before they\ncan convey to us any real and tangible meaning. It was out of the question in\na translation of this character to attempt either an imitation of the original\nrhythm or metre, or to introduce the totally foreign element of rhyming. Such\ntranslations may follow by and by: at present a metrical translation would\nonly be an excuse for an inaccurate translation.\n\nWhile engaged in collecting the evidence on which the meaning of every word\nand every sentence must be founded, I have derived the most important\nassistance from the Sanskrit Dictionary of Professors Bohtlingk and Roth,\nwhich has been in course of publication during the last sixteen years. The\nVedic portion of that Dictionary may, I believe, be taken as the almost\nexclusive work of Professor Roth, and as such, for the sake of brevity, I\nshall treat it in my notes. It would be ungrateful were I not to acknowledge\nmost fully the real benefit which this publication has conferred on every\nstudent of Sanskrit, and my only regret is that its publication has not\nproceeded more rapidly, so that even now years will elapse before we can hope\nto see it finished. But my sincere admiration for the work performed by the\ncompilers of that Dictionary does not prevent me from differing, in many\ncases, from the explanations of Vedic words given by Professor Roth. If I do\nnot always criticise Professor Roth's explanations when I differ from him, the\nreason is obvious. A dictionary without a full\n\np. xxxvi\n\ntranslation of each passage, or without a justification of the meanings\nassigned to each word, is only a preliminary step to a translation. It\nrepresents a first classification of the meanings of the same word in\ndifferent passages, but it gives us no means of judging how, according to the\nopinion of the compiler, the meaning of each single word should be made to fit\nthe general sense of a whole sentence. I do not say this in disparagement,\nfor, in a dictionary, it can hardly be otherwise; I only refer to it in order\nto explain the difficulty I felt whenever I differed from Professor Roth, and\nwas yet unable to tell how the meaning assigned by him to certain words would\nbe justified by the author of the Dictionary himself. On this ground I have\nthroughout preferred to explain every step by which I arrived at my own\nrenderings, rather than to write a running criticism of Professor Roth's\nDictionary. My obligations to him I like to express thus once for all, by\nstating that whenever I found that I agreed with him, I felt greatly assured\nas to the soundness of my own rendering, while whenever I differed from him, I\nnever did so without careful consideration.\n\nThe works, however, which I have hitherto mentioned, though the most\nimportant, are by no means the only ones that have been of use to me in\npreparing my translation of the Rig-veda. The numerous articles on certain\nhymns, verses, or single words occurring in the Rig-veda, published by Vedic\nscholars in Europe and India during the last thirty years, were read by me at\nthe time of their publication, and have helped me to overcome difficulties,\nthe very existence of which is now forgotten. If I go back still further, I\nfeel that in grappling with the first and the greatest of difficulties in the\nstudy of the Veda, I and many others are more deeply indebted than it is\npossible to say, to one whose early loss has been one of the greatest\nmisfortunes to Sanskrit scholarship. It was in Burnouf's lectures that we\nfirst learnt what the Veda was, and how it should form the foundation of all\nour studies. Not only did he most liberally communicate to his pupils his\nvaluable MSS., and teach us how to use these tools, but the results\n\np. xxxvii\n\nof his own experience were freely placed at our service, we were warned\nagainst researches which he knew to be useless, we were encouraged in\nundertakings which he knew to be full of promise. His minute analysis of long\npassages of Saya _n_ a, his independent interpretations of the text of the\nhymns, his comparisons between the words and grammatical forms, the thoughts\nand legends of the Veda and Avesta, his brilliant divination checked by an\ninexorable sense of truth, and his dry logical method enlivened by sallies of\nhumour and sparks of imaginative genius, though not easily forgotten, and\nalways remembered with gratitude, are now beyond the reach of praise or blame.\nWere I to criticise what he or other scholars have said and written many years\nago, they might justly complain of such criticism. It is no longer necessary\nto prove that Nabhanedisht _h_ a cannot mean 'new relatives,' or that there\nnever was a race of Etendhras, or that the angels of the Bible are in no way\nconnected with the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras of the Vedic hymns; and it would, on the other\nhand, be a mere waste of time, were I to attempt to find out who first\ndiscovered that in the Veda deva does not always mean divine, but sometimes\nmeans brilliant. In fact, it could not be done.\n\nIn a new subject like that of the interpretation of the Veda, there are\ncertain things which everybody discovers who has eyes to see. Their discovery\nrequires so little research that it seems almost an insult to say that they\nwere discovered by this or that scholar. Take, for instance, the peculiar\npronunciation of certain words, rendered necessary by the requirements of\nVedic metres. I believe that my learned friend Professor Kuhn was one of the\nfirst to call general attention to the fact that semivowels must frequently be\nchanged into their corresponding vowels, and that long vowels must sometimes\nbe pronounced as two syllables. It is clear, however, from Rosen's notes to\nthe first Ash _t_ aka (I, 1, 8), that he, too, was perfectly aware of this\nfact, and that he recognised the prevalence of this rule, not only with regard\nto semivowels (see his note to RV. I, 2, 9) and long vowels which are the\nresult of Sandhi, but likewise with regard to others that occur in the body of\na\n\np. xxxviii\n\nword. 'Animadverte,' he writes, 'tres syllabas postremas vocis adhvara _n_ am\ndipodiae iambicae munus sustinentes, penultima syllaba praeter iambi prioris\narsin, thesin quoque sequentis pedis ferente. Satis frequentia sunt, in hac\npraesertim dipodiae iambicae sede, exempla syllabae natura longae in tres\nmoras productae. De qua re nihil quidem memoratum invenio apud Pingalam\naliosque qui de arte metrica scripserunt: sed numeros ita, ut modo dictum est,\ncomputandos esse, taciti agnoscere videntur, quum versus una syllaba mancus\nnon eos offendat.'\n\nNow this is exactly the case. The ancient grammarians, as we shall see, teach\ndistinctly that where two vowels have coalesced into one according to the\nrules of Sandhi, they may be pronounced as two syllables; and though they do\nnot teach the same with regard to semivowels and long vowels occurring in the\nbody of the word, yet they tacitly recognise that rule, by frequently taking\nits effects for granted. Thus in Sutra 950 of the Prati _s_ akhya, verse IX,\n111, 1, is called an Atyash _t_ i, and the first pada is said to consist of\ntwelve syllables. In order to get this number, the author must have read,\n\na\xcc\x86ya\xcc\x84 ru\xcc\x86 _k_ a\xcc\x84 ha\xcc\x86ri\xcc\x86 _n_ y\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84 pu\xcc\x86n\xcc\x84a\xcc\x86na\xcc\x86 _h_.\n\n[paragraph continues] Immediately after, verse IV, 1, 3, is called a Dh _ri_\nti, and the first pada must again have twelve syllables. Here therefore the\nauthor takes it for granted that we should read,\n\nsa\xcc\x86khe\xcc\x84 sa\xcc\x86kha\xcc\x84ya\xcc\x86m a\xcc\x86bhy\xcc\x86 a\xcc\x84 va\xcc\x86v _ri_ \xcc\x84tsv\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84 a.\n\n[paragraph continues] No one, in fact, with any ear for rhythm, whether _S_\naunaka and Pi\xe1\xb9\x85gala, or Rosen and Kuhn, could have helped observing these rules\nwhen reading the Veda. But it is quite a different case when we come to the\nquestion as to which words admit of such protracted pronunciation, and which\ndo not. Here one scholar may differ from another according to the view he\ntakes of the character of Vedic metres, and here one has to take careful\naccount of the minute and\n\np. xxxix\n\ningenious observations contained in numerous articles by Professors Kuhn,\nBollensen, Grassmann, and others.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xxxi:a](sbe3203.htm#fr_12) Since the publication of the first volume of the\nRig-veda, many new MSS. have come before me, partly copied for me, partly lent\nto me for a time by scholars in India, but every one of them belonged clearly\nto one of the three families which I have described in my introduction to the\nfirst volume of the Rig-veda. In the beginning of the first Ash _t_ aka, and\noccasionally at the beginning of other Ash _t_ akas, likewise in the\ncommentary on hymns which were studied by native scholars with particular\ninterest, various readings occur in some MSS., which seem at first to betoken\nan independent source, but which are in reality mere marginal notes, due to\nmore or less learned students of these MSS. Thus after verse 3 of the\nintroduction one MS. reads: sa praha n _ri_ pati _m_ , ra _g_ an, saya _n_\naryo mamanu _g_ a _h_ , sarva _m_ vetty esha vedana _m_ vyakhyat _ri_ tvena,\nyu _g_ yatam. The same MS., after verse 4, adds: ityukto madhavarye _n_ a\nvirabukkamahipati _h_ , anva _s_ at saya _n_ a _k_ arya _m_ vedarthasya praka\n_s_ ane.\n\nI had for a time some hope that MSS. written in Grantha or other South-Indian\nalphabets might have preserved an independent text of Saya _n_ a, but from\nsome specimens of a Grantha MS. collated for me by Mr. Eggeling, I do not\nthink that even this hope is meant to be realised. The MS. in question\ncontains a few independent various readings, such as are found in all MSS.,\nand owe their origin clearly to the jottings of individual students. when at\nthe end of verse 6, I found the independent reading, vyutpannas tavata sarva\n_ri_ _k_ o vyakhyatum arhati, I expected that other various readings of the\nsame character might follow. But after a few additions in the beginning, and\nthose clearly taken from other parts of Saya _n_ a's commentary, nothing of\nreal importance could be gleaned from that MS. I may mention as more important\nspecimens of marginal notes that, before the first puna _h_ kid _ri_ _s_ am,\non page 44, line 24 (1st ed.), this MS. reads: athava ya _g_ _n_ asya devam\niti sambandha _h_ , ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya praka _s_ akam ityartha _h_ , purohitam\niti p _ri_ thagvi _s_ esha _n_ am. And again, page 44, line 26, p. xxxii\nbefore puna _h_ kid _ri_ _s_ am, this MS. adds: athava _ri_ tvi _g_ am _ri_\ntvigvid (vad) ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anirvahaka _m_ hotara _m_ devanam ahvataram; tatha\nratnadhatamam. In the same line, after ratnanam, we read rama _n_ iyadhanana\n_m_ va, taken from page 46, line 2. Various readings like these, however,\noccur on the first sheets only, soon after the MS. follows the usual and\nrecognised text. [This opinion has been considerably modified after a complete\ncollation of this MS., made for me by Dr. Winternitz.] For the later Ash _t_\nakas, where all the MSS. are very deficient, and where an independent\nauthority would be of real use, no Grantha MS. has as yet been discovered.\n\n[xxxii:a](sbe3203.htm#fr_13) They have since been printed, but the translation\nhas in consequence been delayed.\n\n[xxxiv:a](sbe3203.htm#fr_14) In the new edition, Langlois' translation has\nbeen omitted, and those of Ludwig and Grassmann have been inserted\noccasionally only.\n\n[xxxviii:a](sbe3203.htm#fr_15) See also Sutra 937 seq. I cannot find any\nauthority for the statement of Professor Kuhn (Beitrage, vol. iii, p. 114)\nthat, according to the Rik-prati _s_ akhya, it is the first semivowel that\nmust be dissolved, unless he referred to the remarks of the commentator to\nSutra 973.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Part 2](sbe3204.htm)\n\n"
