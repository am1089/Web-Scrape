DEFAMATION.\n\n1. 1 Injury (parushya) is declared to be of two kinds, harsh speeches and beating; each of these two kinds is again divided into three species, and the punishment is pronounced to be threefold.\n\n2. 2 Abuse of the first (or lowest) degree means offensive language against, or defamation of, a country, village, family, or the like, without (mentioning) an (individual ignominious) act.\n\n3\\. Referring (in terms of contempt) to a man's sister or mother, or charging\nhim with a minor sin, is termed abuse of a middling sort by the learned in\nlaw.\n\n4\\. Charging a man with taking forbidden food or drinks, or taxing him with a\nmortal sin, or maliciously exposing his weakest points, is termed abuse of the\nhighest degree.\n\n5. 5 When two persons abuse each other, their punishment shall be equal, if they are equals in caste; if one is inferior to the other, his punishment shall be double; for a superior, half (of the ordinary punishment) is ordained.\n\np. 356\n\n6. 6 When persons equal in caste and qualities abuse one another, the punishment ordained for them in the system of law is thirteen Pa _n_ as and a half.\n\n7. 7 For a Brahman abusing a Kshatriya, the fine shall be half of a hundred (fifty Pa _n_ as); for abusing a Vai _s_ ya, half of fifty (twenty-five Pa _n_ as); for abusing a _S_ udra, twelve and a half.\n\n8\\. This punishment has been declared for (abusing) a virtuous _S_ udra who\nhas committed no wrong; no offence is imputable to a Brahman for abusing (a\n_S_ udra) devoid of virtue.\n\n9\\. A Vai _s_ ya shall be fined a hundred (Pa _n_ as) for reviling a\nKshatriya; a Kshatriya reviling a Vai _s_ ya shall have to pay half of that\namount as a fine.\n\n10\\. In the case of a Kshatriya reviling a _S_ udra, the fine shall be twenty\nPa _n_ as; in the case of a Vai _s_ ya, the double amount is declared to be\nthe proper fine by persons learned in law.\n\n11\\. A _S_ udra shall be compelled to pay the first fine for abusing a Vai _s_\nya; the middling fine (for abusing) a Kshatriya; and the highest fine (for\nabusing) a Brahman.\n\n12. 12 (A _S_ udra) teaching the precepts of religion, or uttering the words of the Veda, or insulting a Brahman, shall be punished by cutting out his tongue.\n\n13. 13 (A man) reviling a sister or other (relation) of\n\np. 357\n\nanother person shall give a fine amounting to fifty Pa _n_ as.\n\n14. 14 He who reviles a person's native country or other (belongings of his), shall be fined twelve Pa _n_ as and a half. He who through arrogance imputes an offence to him, shall be compelled to pay the first fine.\n\n15\\. This gradation of fines has been declared by me, subject to modification\nby the sages, in conformity with the (particular caste or qualities of a) man,\nso as either to remain as declared, or to be reduced or raised.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[355:1](sbe3378.htm#fr_1160) XX, 1.
