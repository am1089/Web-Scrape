Sons begotten by a man who approaches in the proper season a woman of\nequal caste, who has 1\n\np. 131\n\nnot belonged to another man, and who has been married legally, have a right to\n(follow) the occupations (of their castes),\n\n2\\. And to (inherit the) estate,\n\n3\\. If they do not sin against either (of their parents). 3\n\n4\\. If a man approaches a woman who had been married before, or was not\nlegally married to him, or, belongs to a different caste, they both commit a\nsin.\n\n5\\. Through their (sin) their son also becomes sinful.\n\n6\\. A Brahma _n_ a (says), \'The son belongs to the begetter.\' 6\n\n7\\. Now they quote also (the following Gatha from the Veda): \'(Having\nconsidered myself) formerly a father, I shall not now allow (any longer) my\nwives (to be approached by other men), since they have declared that a son\nbelongs to the begetter in the world of Yama. The giver of the seed carries\noff the son after death in Yama\'s world; therefore they guard 7\n\np. 132\n\ntheir wives, fearing the seed of strangers. Carefully watch over (the\nprocreation of) your children, lest stranger seed be sown on your soil. In the\nnext world the son belongs to the begetter, an (imprudent) husband makes the\n(begetting of) children vain (for himself).\'\n\n8\\. Transgression of the law and violence are found amongst the ancient\n(sages).\n\n9\\. They committed no sin on account of the greatness of their lustre.\n\n10\\. A man of later times who seeing their (deeds) follows them, falls.\n\n11\\. The gift (or acceptance of a child) and the right to sell (or buy) a\nchild are not recognised. 11\n\n12\\. It is declared in the Veda that at the time of marriage a gift, for (the\nfulfilment of) his wishes, should be made (by the bridegroom) to the father 12\n\np. 133\n\nof the bride, in order to fulfil the law. \'Therefore he should give a hundred\n(cows) besides a chariot; that (gift) he should make bootless (by returning it\nto the giver).\' In reference to those (marriage-rites), the word \'sale\' (which\noccurs in some Sm _ri_ tis is only used as) a metaphorical expression; for the\nunion (of the husband and wife) is effected through the law.\n\n13\\.

See also\nColebrooke, Digest, Book V, Text cxcix.\n\n[131:3](sbe0248.htm#fr_648) Another (commentator) says, \'Neither of the\nparents shall pass them over at (the distribution of) the heritage. Both\n(parents) must leave their property to them.\'--Haradatta. The text of the\nSutra admits of either explanation.\n\n[131:6](sbe0248.htm#fr_649) See also Manu IX, 32 seq., where the same\ndifference of opinion occurs.\n\n[131:7](sbe0248.htm#fr_650) According to Haradatta this Gatha gives the\nsentiments of a husband who neglected to watch his wives, and who had heard\nfrom those learned in the law that the sons or his unfaithful wives would in\nthe next world belong to their natural fathers, and that be would not derive\nany spiritual benefit from their oblations. He adds that this verse does not\nrefer to or prevent the appointment of a eunuch\'s wife or of a childless widow\nto a relation. He also quotes a passage from the _S_ rauta-sutra 1, 9, 7, in\nwhich the dvipita, \'the son of two fathers,\' is mentioned. But Haradatta\'s\nview cannot be reconciled with the statements made below, II, 10, 27, 2-7, p.\n132 where the Niyoga, is plainly forbidden. Baudhayana, who (II, 2, 3, 34)\nquotes the same Gatha, reads in the first line the vocative \' _g_ anaka\'\ninstead of the nominative \' _g_ anaka _h_ ,\' and in the fifth line \'pare bi\n_g_ ani\' instead of \'parabi _g_ ani.\' The commentator Govindasvamin adds that\nthe verses are addressed by the _Ri_ shi Aupa _g_ a\xe1\xb9\x85ghani to king _G_ anaka of\nVideha. The translation of the first line must therefore run thus: \'O _G_\nanaka, now I am jealous of my wives, (though I was) not so formerly,\' &c.\nBaudhayana\'s readings are probably the older ones, and Govindasvamin\'s\nexplanation the right one. See also Colebrooke, Digest, Book V, Text ccli.\n\n[132:11](sbe0248.htm#fr_651) Haradatta thinks that, as most other Sm _ri_ tis\nenumerate the adopted son, and \'the son bought\' in their lists of substitutes\nfor lawful sons of the body, \xc3\x82pastamba\'s rule can refer only to the gift or\nsale of an eldest son, or to the gift or sale of a child effected by a woman.\nThough it is possible that he may be right in his interpretation, it remains a\nremarkable fact that \xc3\x82pastamba does not mention the \'twelve kinds of sons,\'\nwhich are known to other Sm _ri_ tis.\n\n[132:12](sbe0248.htm#fr_652) This Sutra seems to be directed against Vasish\n_th_ a I, 36.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 6, Kha _n_ _d_ a 14](sbe0249.htm)\n\n'
