And (there is also a form of the highest Lord) not abiding in effected\nthings; for thus scripture declares his abiding.\n\nMoreover, according to scripture, there is also an eternal form of the highest\nLord which does not abide in effects; he is not only the ruling soul of the\nspheres of the sun and so on which lie within the sphere of what is effected.\nFor the text declares his abiding in a twofold form, as follows: 'Such is the\ngreatness of it; greater than it is the Person. One foot of him are all\nbeings; three feet of him is what is immortal in heaven' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 12,\n6). And it cannot be maintained that that form of him which is divorced from\nall effects is reached by those who put their trust on his other form; for\ntheir minds are not set on the former. Hence as he who does not reach that\nform of the double-natured highest Lord which is divorced from all qualities\nstops at that form which is distinguished by qualities, so also, unable to\nreach unlimited power within the latter form, he stops at limited lordly\npower.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 20](sbe38336.htm)\n\n"
