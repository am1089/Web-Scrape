Now,\nindeed, there are six doors to the Brahman 3\\--to wit, fire, wind, the waters,\nthe moon, lightning, and the sun.\n\n11:4:4:22\\. He who offers with slightly burnt sacrificial food, enters through\nthe fire-door 4 of the Brahman;\n\np. 67\n\nand, by entering through the fire-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with,\nand participation in the world of, the Brahman.\n\n11:4:4:33\\. And he who offers with sacrificial food that has fallen (on the\nground) enters through the wind-door of the Brahman; and, by entering through\nthe wind-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the\nworld of, the Brahman.\n\n11:4:4:44\\. And he who offers with uncooked sacrificial food, enters through\nthe water-door of the Brahman; and, by entering through the water-door of the\nBrahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the\nBrahman.\n\n11:4:4:55\\. And he who offers with slightly browned sacrificial food, enters\nthrough the moon-door of the Brahman, and, by entering through the moon-door\nof the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the\nBrahman.\n\n11:4:4:66\\. And he who offers with browned sacrificial food, enters through\nthe lightning-door of the Brahman, and, by entering through the lightning-door\nof the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the\nBrahman.\n\n11:4:4:77\\. And he who offers with well-cooked sacrificial food, enters\nthrough the sun-door of the Brahman; and, by entering through the sun-door of\nthe Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the\nBrahman. This, then, is the successful issue of the sacrificial food, and,\nverily, whosoever thus knows this to be the successful issue of the\nsacrificial food, by him offering is made with wholly successful sacrificial\nfood.\n\n11:4:4:88\\. Then, as to the successful issue of the sacrifice. Now, whatever\npart of the sacrifice is incomplete\n\np. 68\n\n[paragraph continues] (nyuna) that part of it is productive for him 1; and\nwhat is redundant in it that is favourable to cattle; and what is broken\n(disconnected) 2 in it that makes for prosperity; and what is perfect in it\nthat is conducive to heaven.\n\n11:4:4:99\\. And if he think, 'There has been that which was incomplete in my\nsacrifice,' let him believe, 'That is productive for me: I shall have\noffspring produced (in men and cattle).'\n\n11:4:4:1010\\. And if he think, 'There has been that which was redundant in my\nsacrifice,' let him believe, 'That is favourable to cattle for me: I shall\nbecome possessed of cattle.'\n\n11:4:4:1111\\. And if he think, 'There has been that which was disconnected in\nmy sacrifice,' let him believe, 'That makes for my prosperity: Prosperity,\nsurrounded by splendour, fame and holy lustre, will accrue to me.'\n\n11:4:4:1212\\. And if he think, 'There has been that which was perfect in my\nsacrifice,' let him believe, 'That is conducive to heaven for me: I shall\nbecome one of those in the heavenly world.' This then is the successful issue\nof the sacrifice; and, verily, whosoever thus knows this to be the successful\nissue of the sacrifice, by him offering is made by a wholly successful\nsacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[66:3](sbe44024.htm#fr_224) That is, of the (impersonal) world-spirit.\n\n[66:4](sbe44024.htm#fr_225) In the text the two words are not compounded, but\nstand in apposition to each other (with the fire as the door of B.), with,\nhowever, much the same force as a compound word.
