Some say: 'Let the swing be one ell (aratni) above the ground, for by that\nmeasure verily the Svarga worlds are measured.' That is not to be regarded.\n\n2\\. Others say: 'Let it be one span (prade _s_ a), for by that measure verily\nthe vital airs were measured.' That is not to be regarded 1.\n\n3\\. Let it be one fist (mush _t_ i), for by that measure verily all eatable\nfood is made, and by that measure\n\np. 174\n\nall eatable food is taken; therefore let it be one fist above the ground.\n\n4\\. They say: 'Let him mount the swing from east to west, like he who shines;\nfor the sun mounts these worlds from east to west.' That is not to be\nregarded.\n\n5\\. Others say: 'Let him mount the swing sideways, for people mount a horse\nsideways 1, thinking that thus they will obtain all desires.' That is not to\nbe regarded.\n\n6\\. They say: 'Let him mount the swing 2 from behind, for people mount a ship\nfrom behind, and this swing is a ship in which to go to heaven.' Therefore let\nhim mount it from behind.\n\n7\\. Let him touch the swing with his chin ( _kh_ ubuka). The parrot ( _s_ uka)\nthus mounts a tree, and he is of all birds the one who eats most food.\nTherefore let him touch it with his chin.\n\n8\\. Let him mount the swing with his arms 3. The hawk swoops thus on birds and\non trees, and he is of all birds the strongest. Therefore let him mount with\nhis arms.\n\n9\\. Let him not withdraw one foot (the right or left) from the earth, for fear\nthat he may lose his hold.\n\n10\\. The Hot _ri_ mounts the swing, the Udgat _ri_ the seat made of Udumbara\nwood. The swing is masculine, the seat feminine, and they form a union. Thus\nhe makes a union at the beginning of the uktha in order to get offspring.\n\np. 175\n\nHe who knows this, gets offspring and cattle.\n\n12\\. Next the swing is food, the seat fortune. Thus he mounts and obtains food\nand fortune.\n\n13\\. The Hotrakas (the Prasast _ri_ , Brahma _n_ a _k_ _kh_ a _m_ sin, Pot\n_ri_ , Nesh _t_ ri, Agnadhra, and A _k_ _kh_ avaka) together with the Brahman\nsit down on cushions made of grass, reeds, leaves, &c.\n\n14\\. Plants and trees, after they have grown up, bear fruit. Thus if the\npriests mount on that day altogether (on their seats), they mount on solid and\nfluid as their proper food. Therefore this serves for the attainment of solid\nas proper food 1.\n\n15\\. Some say: 'Let him descend after saying vasha _t_  2. 'That is not to be\nregarded. For, verily, that respect is not shown which is shown to one who\ndoes not see it 3.\n\n16\\. Others say: 'Let him descend after he has taken the food in his hand.'\nThat is not to be regarded. For, verily, that respect is not shown which is\nshown to one after he has approached quite close.\n\n17\\. Let him descend after he has seen the food. For, verily, that is real\nrespect which is shown to one when he sees it. Only after having actually\n\np. 176\n\nseen the food (that is brought to the sacrifice), let him descend from the\nswing.\n\n18\\. Let him descend turning towards the east, for in the east the seed of the\ngods springs up 1. Therefore let him rise turning towards the east, yea,\nturning towards the east.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[173:1](sbe01187.htm#fr_421) They rise one span above the heart, and they\nproceed one span from out the mouth. Comm.\n\n[174:1](sbe01187.htm#fr_422) Here we have clearly riding on horseback.\n\n[174:2](sbe01187.htm#fr_423) While the swing points to the east, let him stand\nwest, and thus mount.\n\n[174:3](sbe01187.htm#fr_424) The fore-arms, from the elbow to the end, the\naratni. Comm.\n\n[175:1](sbe01187.htm#fr_425) One expects isha _h_ before ur _g_ a _h_ , but it\nis wanting in both text and commentary, and in other MSS. also.\n\n[175:2](sbe01187.htm#fr_426) The word by which the Hot _ri_ invites the\nAdhvaryu to offer the oblation to the gods. The descending from the swing\nbelongs, of course, to a later part of the sacrifice.\n\n[175:3](sbe01187.htm#fr_427) it is supposed that the Hot _ri_ rises from the\nswing to show respect to the sacrificial food, when it is brought near. But as\nit is not brought near, immediately after the Hot _ri_ has finished his part\nwith the word vasha _t_ , the food could not see the Hot _ri_ rise, and this\nmark of respect, intended for the food, would thus be lost.\n\n[176:1](sbe01187.htm#fr_428) Should it be devareta _h_ sampra _g_ ayate, or\ndevaretasam pra _g_ ayate?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 1](sbe01188.htm)\n\n"
