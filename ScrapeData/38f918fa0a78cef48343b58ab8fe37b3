I cried aloud.  \nThen from the trembling hermits broke  \nOne long sad cry, and thus they spoke:  \n'Fiends of the wood, who wear at will  \nEach varied shape, afflict us still.  \nTo thee in our distress we fly:  \nO help us, Rama, or we die.  \nWhen sacred rites of fire are due,  \nWhen changing moons are full or new,  \nThese fiends who bleeding flesh devour  \nAssail us with resistless power.  \nThey with their cruel might torment  \nThe hermits on their vows intent:  \nWe look around for help and see  \nOur surest refuge, Prince, in thee.  \nWe, armed with powers of penance, might  \nDestroy the rovers of the night:  \nBut loth were we to bring to naught  \nThe merit years of toil have bought.  \nOur penance rites are grown too hard,  \nBy many a check and trouble barred,  \nBut though our saints for food are slain  \nThe withering curse we yet restrain.  \n\nThus many a weary day distressed  \nBy giants who this wood infest,  \nWe see at length deliverance, thou  \nWith Lakshman art our guardian now.'  \n   As thus the troubled hermits prayed,  \nI promised, dame, my ready aid,  \nAnd now--for truth I hold most dear--  \nStill to my word must I adhere.  \nMy love, I might endure to be  \nDeprived of Lakshman, life, and thee,  \nBut ne'er deny my promise, ne'er  \nTo Brahmans break the oath I sware.  \nI must, enforced by high constraint,  \nProtect them all. Each suffering saint  \nIn me, unasked, his help had found;  \nStill more in one by promise bound.  \nI know thy words, mine own dear dame,  \nFrom thy sweet heart's affection came:  \nI thank thee for thy gentle speech,  \nFor those we love are those we teach.  \n'Tis like thyself, O fair of face,  \n'Tis worthy of thy noble race:  \nDearer than life, thy feet are set  \nIn righteous paths they ne'er forget.'  \n   Thus to the Maithil monarch's child,  \nHis own dear wife, in accents mild  \n   The high-souled hero said:  \nThen to the holy groves which lay  \nBeyond them fair to see, their way  \n   The bow-armed chieftain led.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XI.: Agastya.](ry209.htm)\n\n"
