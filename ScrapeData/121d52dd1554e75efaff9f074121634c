When a man (who is the sacrificer) hungers, thirsts, and abstains from\npleasures, that is the Diksha (initiatory rite).\n\n2\\. When a man eats, drinks, and enjoys pleasures, he does it with the\nUpasadas (the sacrificial days on which the sacrificer is allowed to partake\nof food).\n\n3\\. When a man laughs, eats, and delights himself, he does it with the Stuta-\n_s_ astras (hymns sung and recited at the sacrifices).\n\n4\\. Penance, liberality, righteousness, kindness, truthfulness, these form his\nDakshi _n_ as (gifts bestowed on priests, &c.)\n\n5\\. Therefore when they say, \'There will be a\n\np. 52\n\nbirth,\' and \'there has been a birth\' (words used at the Soma-sacrifice, and\nreally meaning, \'He will pour out the Soma-juice,\' and \'he has poured out the\nSoma-juice\'), that is his new birth. His death is the Avabh _ri_ tha ceremony\n(when the sacrificial Vessels are carried away to be cleansed).\n\n6\\. Ghora \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa, after having communicated this (view of the sacrifice) to\nK _ri_ sh _n_ a, the son of Dev\xc4\x83ki 1\\--and he never thirsted again (after\nother knowledge)--said: \'Let a man, when his end approaches,\n\np. 53\n\ntake refuge with this Triad 1: "Thou art the imperishable," "Thou art the\nunchangeable," "Thou art the edge of Pra _n_ a."\' On this subject there are\ntwo _Ri_ _k_ verses (Rig-veda VIII, 6, 30):--\n\n7\\. \'Then they see (within themselves) the ever-present light of the old seed\n(of the world, the Sat), the highest, which is lighted in the brilliant\n(Brahman).\' Rig-veda I, 50, 10:--\n\n\'Perceiving above the darkness (of ignorance) the higher light (in the sun),\nas the higher light within the heart, the bright source (of light and life)\namong the gods, we have reached the highest light, yea, the highest light 2.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[51:1](sbe01075.htm#fr_187) Here we have a representation of the sacrifice as\nperformed without any ceremonial, and as it is often represented when\nperformed in thought only by a man living in the forest.\n\n[52:1](sbe01075.htm#fr_188) The curious coincidence between K _ri_ sh _n_ a\nDevakiputra, here mentioned as a pupil of Ghora \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa, and the famous K\n_ri_ sh _n_ a, the son of Devaki, was first pointed out by Colebrooke,\nMiscell. Essays, II, 177. Whether it is more than a coincidence, is difficult\nto say. Certainly we can build no other conclusions on it than those indicated\nby Colebrooke, that new fables may have been constructed elevating this\npersonage to the rank of a god. We know absolutely nothing of the old K _ri_\nsh _n_ a Devakiputra except his having been a pupil of Ghora \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa, nor\ndoes there seem to have been any attempt made by later Brahmans to connect\ntheir divine K _ri_ sh _n_ a, the son of Vasudeva, with the K _ri_ sh _n_ a\nDevakiputra of our Upanishad. This is all the more remarkable because the\nauthor of the Sa _n_ _d_ ilya-sutras, for instance, who is very anxious to\nfind a _s_ rauta authority for the worship of K _ri_ sh _n_ a Vasudeva as the\nsupreme deity, had to be satisfied with quoting such modern compilations as\nthe Naraya _n_ opanishad, Atharva _s_ iras, VI, 9, brahma _n_ yo devakiputro,\nbrahmanyo madhusudana _h_ (see Sa _n_ _d_ ilya-sutras, ed. Ballantyne, p. 36,\ntranslated by Cowell, p. 51), without venturing to refer to the K _ri_ sh _n_\na Devakiputra of the Khandogya-upanishad. The occurrence of such names as K\n_ri_ sh _n_ a, Vasudeva, Madhusudanah stamps Upanishads, like the \xc3\x82tmabodha-\nupanishad, as modern (Colebrooke, Essays, 1, 101), and the same remark\napplies, as Weber has shown, to the Gopalatapani-upanishad (Bibliotheca\nIndica, No. 183), where we actually find such names as _S_ rik _ri_ sh _n_ a\nGovinda, Gopi _g_ anavallabha, Devakyam gata _h_ (p. 38), &c. Professor Weber\nhas treated these questions very fully, but it is not quite clear to me\nwhether he wishes to go beyond Colebrooke and to admit more than a similarity\nof name between the pupil of Ghora \xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa and the friend of the Gopis.\n\n[53:1](sbe01075.htm#fr_189) Let him recite these three verses.\n\n[53:2](sbe01075.htm#fr_190) Both these verses had to be translated here\naccording to their scholastic interpretation, but they had originally a\ntotally different meaning. Even the text was altered, diva being changed to\ndivi, sva _h_ to sve. The first is taken from a hymn addressed to Indra, who\nafter conquering the dark clouds brings back the light of the sun. When he\ndoes that, then the people see again, as the poet says, the daily light of the\nold seed (from which the sun rises) which is lighted in heaven. The other\nverse belongs to a hymn addressed to the sun. Its simple meaning. is: \'Seeing\nabove the darkness (of the night) the rising light, the Sun, bright among the\nbright, we came towards the highest light.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 18](sbe01076.htm)\n\n'
