As the Self is within all, as in the case of the aggregate of the\nelements, (there is oneness of vidya).\n\nThe Va _g_ asaneyins record, in the questions asked by Ushasta and by Kahola,\nthe same passage twice in succession, 'Tell me the Brahman which is present to\nintuition, not hidden; the Self who is within all' (B _ri_. Up. III, 4, 1; 5,\n1).--The question here presents itself whether the two sections introduced by\nthe questions constitute one vidya only or two separate vidyas.\n\nTwo separate vidyas, the purvapakshin maintains; owing to the force of\nrepetition. For if the second passage added nothing to--or took nothing away\nfrom--the contents of the first, the repetition would be altogether\nmeaningless. We therefore conclude that the repetition intimates the\nseparateness of the two vidyas, just as in the Purva Mima _m_ sa repetition\nshows two sacrificial actions to be separate.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. As both texts equally declare the Self to\nbe within all, they must be taken as constituting one vidya only. In both\npassages question and answer equally refer to a Self which is within\neverything. For in one body there cannot be two Selfs, each of which is inside\neverything else. One Self indeed may without difficulty be within everything,\nbut of a second one this could not be predicated, not any more than of the\naggregate of the elements; i.e. the case of that second Self is analogous to\nthat of the aggregate of the five elements, i.e. the body. In the body the\nelement of water is indeed within the element of earth, and the element of\nfire within the element of water; but each of these elements is 'within all'\nin a relative sense only, not in the literal sense of the phrase.--Or else the\n'like the aggregate of the elements (or beings)' of the Sutra has to be taken\nas pointing to another scriptural passage, viz. _S_ ve. Up. VI, 11, 'He is the\none god, hidden in all beings, all-pervading, the Self within all beings.' As\nthis mantra records that one Self lives within the aggregate of all beings,\n\np. 243\n\nthe same holds good with regard to the two Brahma _n_ a-passages. And the\nobject of knowledge being one, the vidya also is one only.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 36](sbe38179.htm)\n\n"
