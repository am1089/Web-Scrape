It is a Mantra-upanishad, i.e. it\nhas the form of a Mantra. But, as the commentators observe, though it is\nwritten in verse, it is not, like other Mantras, to be used for sacrificial\npurposes. Its only object is to teach the highest knowledge, the knowledge of\nBrahman, which cannot be obtained either by sacrifices or by worship\n(upasana), but by such teaching only as is imparted in the Upanishad. A man\nmay a hundred times restrain his breath, &c., but without the Upanishad his\nignorance does not cease. Nor is it right to continue for ever in the\nperformance of sacrificial and other good works, if one wishes to obtain the\nhighest knowledge of Brahman. The Sannyasin alone, who has given up\neverything, is qualified to know and to become Brahman. And though it might\nseem from Vedic legends that G _ri_ hasthas also who continued to live with\ntheir families, performing all the duties required of them by law, had been in\npossession of the highest knowledge, this, we are told, is a mistake. Works\nand knowledge can be as little together as darkness and light.\n\nThis Upanishad too has been often translated since it first appeared in the\nPersian translation of Dara Shukoh. My own copy of the text and _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's\ncommentary from the MS. in the Chambers Collection was made in October 1844.\nBoth are now best accessible in the Bibliotheca Indica, where Dr. Roer has\npublished the text, the [commentary](errata.htm#0) by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, a gloss by\n\xc3\x82nanda _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana, and an English translation with notes.\n\nThe title of the Upanishad, Mu _n_ _d_ aka, has not yet been explained. The\nUpanishad is called Mu _n_ _d_ aka-upanishad, and its three chapters are each\ncalled Mu _n_ _d_ akam. Native commentators explain it as the shaving\nUpanishad, that is, as the Upanishad which cuts off the errors of the mind,\nlike a razor. Another Upanishad also is called Kshurika, the razor, a name\nwhich is explained in the text itself as\n\np. xxvii\n\nmeaning an instrument for removing illusion and error. The title is all the\nmore strange because Mu _n_ _d_ aka, in its commonest acceptation, is used as\na term of reproach for Buddhist mendicants, who are called 'Shavelings,' in\nopposition to the Brahmans, who dress their hair carefully, and often display\nby its peculiar arrangement either their family or their rank. Many doctrines\nof the Upanishads are, no doubt, pure Buddhism, or rather Buddhism is on many\npoints the consistent carrying out of the principles laid down in the\nUpanishads. Yet, for that very reason, it seems impossible that this should be\nthe origin of the name, unless we suppose that it was the work of a man who\nwas, in one sense, a Mu _n_ _d_ aka, and yet faithful to the Brahmanic law.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III: The Taittiriyaka-Upanishad](sbe15005.htm)\n\n"
