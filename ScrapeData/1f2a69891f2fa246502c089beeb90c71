He\nwas a farmer, but poor was the return his labour brought him. One day, at the\nend of the hot hours, the Brahman, overcome by the heat, lay down under the\nshadow of a tree to have a doze. Suddenly he saw a great hooded snake creeping\nout of an ant-hill near at hand. So he thought to himself, "Sure this is the\nguardian deity of the field, and I have not ever worshipped it. That\'s why my\nfarming is in vain. I will at once go and pay my respects to it."\n\nWhen he had made up his mind, he got some milk, poured it into a bowl, and\nwent to the ant-hill, and said aloud:\n\n"O Guardian of this Field! all this while I did not know that you dwelt here.\nThat is why I have not yet paid my respects to you; pray forgive me." And he\nlaid the milk down and went to his house. Next morning he came and looked, and\nhe saw a gold denar in the bowl, and from that time onward every day the same\nthing occurred: he gave milk to the serpent and found a gold denar.\n\nOne day the Brahman had to go to the village, and so be ordered his son to\ntake the milk to the ant-hill. The son brought the milk, put it down, and went\nback home. Next day he went again and found a denar, so he thought to himself:\n"This, ant-hill is surely full of golden denars; I\'ll kill the serpent, and\ntake them all for myself." So next day, while he was giving the milk to the\nserpent, the Brahman\'s son struck it on the head with a cudgel. But the\nserpent escaped death by the will of fate, and in a rage bit the Brahman\'s son\nwith its sharp fangs, and he fell down dead at once. His people raised him a\nfuneral pyre not far from the field and burnt him to ashes.\n\nTwo days afterwards his father came back, and when he learnt his son\'s fate he\ngrieved and mourned. But after a time, be took the bowl of milk, went to the\nant-hill, and praised the serpent with a loud voice. After a long, long time\nthe serpent appeared, but only with its head out of the opening of the ant-\nhill, and spoke to the Brahman: "\'Tis greed that brings you here, and makes\nyou even forget the loss of your son. From this time forward friendship\nbetween us is impossible. Your son struck me in youthful ignorance, and I have\nbitten him to death. How can I forget the blow with the cudgel? And how can\nyou forget the pain and grief at the loss of your son?" So speaking, it gave\nthe Brahman a costly pearl and disappeared. But before it went away it said:\n"Come back no more." The Brahman took the pearl, and went back home, cursing\nthe folly of his son.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Son of Seven Queens](ift17.htm)\n\n'
