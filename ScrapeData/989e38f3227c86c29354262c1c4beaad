I implore [1](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:1:1) Agni, the gracious, with\nsalutations, may he sit down here, and gather what we have made\n[2](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:1:2). I offer [3](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:1:3) (him\nsacrifice) as with racing chariots; may I, turning to the right, accomplish\nthis hymn to the Maruts.\n\n2\\. Those who approached on their glorious deer, on their easy chariots, the\nRudras, the Maruts,--through fear of you, ye terrible ones, the forests even\nbend down, the earth shakes, and also the mountain (cloud).\n\n3\\. At your shouting, even the mountain (cloud), grown large, fears, and the\nridge of heaven trembles. When you play together, O Maruts, armed with spears,\nyou run together like waters.\n\n4\\. Like rich suitors the Maruts have themselves [1](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:4:1)\nadorned their bodies with golden ornaments; more glorious for glory\n[2](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:4:2), and powerful on their chariots, they have\nbrought together splendours on their bodies.\n\n5\\. As brothers, no one being the eldest or the youngest, they have grown up\ntogether to happiness. Young is their clever father Rudra, flowing with plenty\nis P _ri_ _s_ ni (their mother), always kind to the Maruts.\n\n6\\. O happy Maruts, whether you are in the highest, or in the middle, or in\nthe lowest heaven, from thence, O Rudras, or thou also, O Agni. take notice of\nthis libation which we offer.\n\np. 353\n\n7\\. When Agni, and you, wealthy Maruts, drive down from the higher heaven over\nthe ridges, give then, if pleased, you roarers, O destroyers of enemies\n[1](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:7:1), wealth to the sacrificer who prepares (Soma\njuice).\n\n8\\. Agni, be pleased to drink Soma with the brilliant Maruts, the singers,\napproaching in companies [1](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:8:1), with the men (\xc3\x82yus\n[2](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:8:2)), who brighten and enliven everything; do this, O\nVai _s_ vanara (Agni), thou who art always endowed with splendour.\n\np. 354\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn, by the same poet, is supposed to be addressed either to the Maruts\nalone, or to the Maruts and Agni. The same might have been said of hymn 56 and\nothers which are used for the \xc3\x82gnimaruta _S_ astra. See Bergaigne, Recherches\nsur l'histoire de la liturgie vedique, p. 38. Metre, 1-6 Trish _t_ ubh; 7, 8\n_G_ agati. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., except\nverse i in AV. VII, 50, 3; TB. II, 7, 12, 4; MS. IV, 14, 11; verse 3 in TS.\nIII, 1, 11, 5; MS. IV, 12, 5; verse 6 in TB. II, 7, 12, 4.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nThe AV. reads sva\xc2\xb4vasum, prasakto, pradakshi _n_ am, all of them inferior\nreadings. The TB. agrees with RV., except that it seems to read prasapta _h_\n(prakarshe _n_ a samagata _h_ ).\n\nNote 1. That i _l_ or i _d_ has originally the meaning of imploring, asking,\nbegging, we see from such passages as RV. III, 48, 3. upasthaya mataram annam\nai _t_ _t_ a, 'he, having approached his mother, asked for food,' unless we\nprefer to construe i _d_ with two accusatives, 'he, having approached, asked\nhis mother for food.' The same verb is also construed with the accusative of\nthe god implored, the dative of the object, and the instrumental of the means\nby which he is implored. See RV. VIII, 71, 14. agnim i _li_ shva avase\nga\xc2\xb4thabhi _h_ , implore Agni with songs for his protection. Whether the root i\n_d_ is distantly connected with either ish, to desire (Brugmann, I, 591), or\nwith ard, to stir, or with ar, to go, is a question which admits of many, or\nof no answer.\n\nNote 2. Vi _k_ i k _ri_ tam seems to have the settled meaning of gathering in\nwhat one has made at play, or in battle; see X, 42, 9; 43, 5; IX, 97, 58; X,\n102, 2. The same meaning is applicable here, though we may also translate,\nTake notice of our k _ri_ ta or our karma, i. e. the sacrifice.' A similar\nthought is expressed in verse 6. Saya _n_ a explains vi _g_ anatu and vi _k_\ninuyat.\n\nNote 3. Perhaps pra bhare means, 'I am carried forth,' as in V, 59, 4, where\nit is applied to the Maruts.\n\np. 355\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. See note 2 to I, 6, 4. Instead of svadha\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ we have svayam in\nVII, 56, 11.\n\nNote 2. _S_ riye _s_ reya _m_ sa _h_ is difficult to translate; cf. II, 33, 3.\nsresh _th_ a _h_ _s_ riya\xc2\xb4 asi. Ludwig translates, zu herlichkeit die\nherlichen.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. On ri _s_ adas, see Aufrecht, Bezzenb. Beitr. XIV, p. 32.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. On ga _n_ a _s_ ri\xc2\xb4, see BR. s. v.; Lanman, 372; Benfey Vedica und\nVerwandtes, p. 108; Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, 53 seq. Ludwig translates\nscharenherlich, but what does that mean? 'Shining in their companies' is a\npossible meaning, but the analogy of abhi _s_ ri\xc2\xb4 and adhvara _s_ ri\xc2\xb4 points\nin another direction.\n\nNote 2. On the \xc3\x82yus as a proper name, see Bergaigne, Rel. Ved. I, 62; II, 323.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 61. To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)](sbe3243.htm)\n\n"
