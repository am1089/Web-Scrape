But the conceptions of the Imperishable are to be comprised (in all\nmeditations). There being equality (of the Brahman to be meditated on) and\n(those conceptions) existing (in Brahman); as in the case of what belongs to\nthe upasad. This has been explained.\n\np. 653\n\nWe read in the B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka (III, 8, 9),'O Gargi, the Brahma _n_ as\ncall that the Akshara. It is neither coarse nor fine,' and so on. And in the\nAtharva _n_ a (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5) we have 'The higher knowledge is that by which\nthe Akshara is apprehended. That which cannot be seen nor seized,' &c. The\ndoubt here arises whether all the qualities there predicated of Brahman--\ncalled akshara, i.e. the Imperishable--and constituting something contrary in\nnature to the apparent world, are to be included in all meditations on\nBrahman, or only those where the text specially mentions them. The\nPurvapakshin advocates the latter view; for, he says, there is no authority\nfor holding that the qualities which characterise one meditation are\ncharacteristic of other meditations also; and such negative attributes as are\nmentioned in those two texts do not--as positive qualities such as bliss do--\ncontribute to the apprehension of the true nature of Brahman. What those two\ntexts do is merely to deny of Brahman, previously apprehended as having bliss,\nand so on, for its essential qualities, certain qualities belonging to the\nempirical world, such as grossness, and so on; for all negation must refer to\nan established basis.--This view the Sutra refutes. The ideas of absence of\ngrossness, and so on, which are connected with Brahman viewed as the Akshara,\nare to be included in all meditations on Brahman. For the imperishable\n(akshara) Brahman is the same in all meditations, and qualities such as non-\ngrossness enter into the conception of its essential nature. The apprehension\nof a thing means the apprehension of its specific character. But mere bliss,\nand so on, does not suggest the specific character of Brahman, since those\nqualities belong also to the individual soul. What is specifically\ncharacteristic of Brahman is bliss, and so on, in so far as fundamentally\nopposed to all evil and imperfection. The individual soul, on the other hand,\nalthough fundamentally free from evil, yet is capable of connexion with evil.\nNow being fundamentally opposed to evil implies having a character the\nopposite of grossness and all similar qualities which belong to the empirical\nworld, material and mental. He therefore who thinks of\n\np. 654\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman must think of it as having for its essential\nnature bliss, knowledge, and so on, in so far as distinguished by absence of\ngrossness and the like, and those qualities, being no less essential than\nbliss, and so on, must therefore be included in all meditations on Brahman.--\nThe Sutra gives an instance illustrating the principle that qualities\n(secondary matters) follow the principal matter to which they belong. As the\nmantra 'Agnir vai hotra _m_ vetu,' although given in the Sama-veda, yet has to\nbe recited in the Ya _g_ ur-veda style, with a subdued voice, because it\nstands in a subordinate relation to the upasad-offerings prescribed for the\nfour-days 'sacrifice called _G_ amadagnya; those offerings are the principal\nmatter to which the subordinate matter--the mantra--has to conform. This point\nis explained in the first section, i.e. in the Purva Mima _m_ sa-sutras III,\n3, 9.--But this being admitted, it would follow that as Brahman is the\nprincipal matter in all meditations on Brahman, and secondary matters have to\nfollow the principal matter, also such qualities as 'doing all works, enjoying\nall odours and the like,' which are mentioned in connexion with special\nmeditations only, would indiscriminately have to be included in all\nmeditations.--With reference to this the next Sutra says.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 34.
