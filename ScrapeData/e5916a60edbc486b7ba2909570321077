The poet begins with a somewhat abrupt description of a sunrise. Indra\nis taken as the god of the bright day, whose steed is the sun, and whose\ncompanions the Maruts, or the storm-gods. Arusha, meaning originally red, is\nused as a proper name of the horse or of the rising sun, though it occurs more\nfrequently as the name of the red horses or flames of Agni, the god of fire,\nand also of the morning light. In our passage, Arusha, a substantive, meaning\nthe red of the morning, has taken bradhna as an\n\np. 17\n\nadjective,--bradhna meaning, as far as can be made out, bright in general,\nthough, as it is especially applied to the Soma-juice, perhaps bright-brown or\nyellow. Names of colour are difficult to translate from one language into\nanother, for their shades vary, and withdraw themselves from sharp definition.\nWe shall meet with this difficulty again and again in the Veda; see RV. X, 20,\n9.\n\nAs it has actually been doubted whether bradhna arusha can be meant for the\nsun, and whether the Vedic poets ever looked upon the sun as a horse, I may\nquote Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XXIII, 4, where the same verse occurs and is declared\nto be addressed to the sun; and _S_ atap. Br. XIII, 2, 6, 1, where we read, yu\n_\xc3\xb1_ _g_ anti bradhnam arusha _m_ _k_ arantam iti, asau va adityo\nbradhno\xe0\xa4\xbdrusho\xe0\xa4\xbdmum evasma aditya _m_ yunakti svargasya lokasya samash _t_ yai.\nLudwig remarks justly that the sun has been conceived as a chariot also, and\nthat bradhna arusha may have been thus understood here. Delbruck translates\nquite boldly: Sie schirren die rothe Sonne an. See also Tait. Br. III, 7, 7,\n4; Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. XXIII, 3, 5; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh. Br. II, 17, 3; Ludwig, Comm. ii.\np. 173. M. Bergaigne (Rel. Ved. iii. p. 324) remarks very truly: 'Le soleil\nest tantot une roue, tantot un char, tantot un cheval, trainant le char,\ntantot un heros monte sur le char et dirigeant les chevaux.'\n\nThe following passages will illustrate the principal meaning of arusha, and\njustify the translation here adopted.\n\n#### Arusha, as an Adjective.\n\nArusha is used as an adjective in the sense of red:\n\nVII, 97, 6. tam _s_ agma\xc2\xb4sa _h_ arusha\xc2\xb4sa _h_ a _s_ va _h_ b _r i_haspatim\nsaha-va\xc2\xb4ha _h_ vahanti,--nabha _h_ ni rupam arusham vasana _h_.\n\nPowerful red horses, drawing together draw him, B _ri_ haspati: horses clothed\nin red colour, like the sky.\n\nIII, 1, 4. _s_ vetam _g_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anam arusham mahi-tva\xc2\xb4.\n\nAgni, the white, when born; the red, by growth. III, 15, 3. k _ri_ sh _n_ a\xc2\xb4su\nagne arusha _h_ vi bhahi.\n\nShine, O Agni, red among the dark ones.\n\nIII, 31, 21; VI, 27, 7.\n\np. 18\n\nVII, 75, 6. prati dyutana\xc2\xb4m arusha\xc2\xb4sa _h_ a _s_ va _h_ _k_ itra\xc2\xb4 _h_ ad _ri_\n_s_ ran ushasam vahanta _h_.\n\nThe red horses, the beautiful, were seen bringing to us the bright dawn.\n\nV, 43, 12; I, 118, 5; IV, 43, 6; V, 73, 5; I, 36, 9; VII, 3, 3; 16, 3; X, 45,\n7; I, 141, 8.\n\nII, 2, 8. sa _h_ idhana _h_ ushasa _h_ ra\xc2\xb4mya _h_ anu sva\xc2\xb4 _h_ na didet arushe\n_n_ a bhanuna.\n\nHe (Agni), lit after the lovely dawns, shone like the sky with his red\nsplendour.\n\nIII, 29, 6; IV, 58, 7; I, 114, 5; V, 59, 5; 12, 2; 12, 6; VI, 8, 1.\n\nVI, 48, 6. _s_ yava\xc2\xb4su arusha _h_ v _r i_sha.\n\nIn the dark (nights) the red hero (Agni). Cf. III, 7, 5.\n\nIn one passage v _r i_shan arusha is intended for fire in the shape of\nlightning.\n\nX, 89, 9. ni amitreshu vadham indra tumram v _r i_shan v _r i_sha _n_ am\narusham _s_ i _s_ ihi.\n\nWhet, O strong Indra, the heavy strong red weapon, against the enemies.\n\nX, 43, 9. ut _g_ ayatam para _s_ u _h_ _g_ yotisha saha--vi ro _k_ atam arusha\n_h_ bhanuna _s_ u _k_ i _h_.\n\nMay the axe (the thunderbolt) appear with the light--may the red one blaze\nforth, bright with splendour.\n\nX, 1, 6; VI, 3, 6.\n\nX, 20, 9. k _ri_ sh _n_ a _h_ _s_ veta _h_ arusha _h_ ya\xc2\xb4ma _h_ asya bradhna\n_h_ ri _g_ ra _h_ uta _s_ o _n_ a _h_.\n\nHis (Agni's) path is black, white, red, bright, reddish, and yellow.\n\nHere it is extremely difficult to keep all the colours distinct.\n\nArusha is frequently applied to Soma, particularly in the 9th Ma _n_ _d_ ala.\nThere we read:\n\nIX, 8, 6. arusha _h_ hari _h_. IX, 71, 7. arusha _h_ diva _h_ kavi _h_ v _r\ni_sha. IX, 74, 1. va\xc2\xb4 _g_ i\xc2\xb4 arusha _h_. IX, 82, 1. arusha _h_ v _r i_sha hari\n_h_. IX, 89, 3. harim arusham.\n\nIX, 111, 1. arusha _h_ hari _h_. See also IX, 25, 5; 61, 21.\n\nIn IX, 72, 1, arusha seems used as a substantive in the sense of red-horse.\n\np. 19\n\nProfessor Spiegel, in his important review of my translation (Heidelberger\nJahrbucher, 1870, p. 104), points out that aurusha in Zend means white, so\nthat it would seem as if the original meaning of arusha had been bright,\nbright like fire, and thus red.\n\n#### Arusha, as an Appellative.\n\nArusha is used as an appellative, and in the following senses:\n\n1\\. The one red-horse of the Sun, the two or more red-horses of Agni.\n\nI, 6, 1. yu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ anti bradhnam arusham.\n\nThey yoke the bright red-horse (the Sun).\n\nI, 94, 10. yat ayuktha _h_ arusha\xc2\xb4 rohita rathe.\n\nWhen thou (Agni) hadst yoked the two red-horses and the two ruddy horses to\nthe chariot. 1, 146, 2.\n\nII, 10, 2. _s_ ruya\xc2\xb4 _h_ agni _h_ --havam me-- _s_ yava\xc2\xb4 ratham vahata _h_\nrohita va uta arusha\xc2\xb4.\n\nMayest thou, Agni, hear my call, whether the two black, or the two ruddy, or\nthe two red-horses carry you.\n\nHere three kinds of colours are clearly distinguished, and an intentional\ndifference is made between rohita and arusha. IV, 2, 3.\n\nIV, 6, 9. tava tye agne harita _h_ --rohitasa _h_ --arusha\xc2\xb4sa _h_ v _r i_sha\n_n_ a _h_.\n\nTo thee (Agni) belong these bays, these ruddy, these red-horses, the\nstallions.\n\nHere, again, three kinds of horses are distinguished--Harits, Rohitas, and\nArushas.\n\nVIII, 34, 17. ye _ri_ _g_ ra _h_ va\xc2\xb4ta-ra _m_ hasa _h_ arusha\xc2\xb4sa _h_\nraghusyada _h_.\n\nHere arusha may be the subject, and the rest adjectives; but it is also\npossible to fake all the words as adjectives, referring them to a _s_ u in the\nnext verse. The fact that _ri_ _g_ ra likewise expresses a peculiar red\ncolour, is no objection, as may be seen from I, 6, I; 94, 10.\n\nVII, 42, 2. yu\xe1\xb9\x85kshva--harita _h_ rohita _h_ _k_ a ye va sadman arusha\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\np. 20\n\nYoke (O Agni) the bays, and the ruddy horses, or the red-horses which are in\nthy stable. VII, 16, 2.\n\n2\\. The cloud, represented as one of the horses of the Maruts.\n\nI, 85, 5. uta arushasya vi syanti dha\xc2\xb4ra _h_.\n\n(When you go to the battle, O Maruts), the streams of the red (horse) flow\noff.\n\nV, 56, 7. uta sya _h_ va\xc2\xb4 _g_ i\xc2\xb4 arusha _h_.\n\nThis strong red-horse,--meant for one of the horses of the Maruts, but, at the\nsame time, as sending rain.\n\n#### Arusha, as the Proper Name of a Solar Deity.\n\nBesides the passages in which arusha is used either as an adjective, in the\nsense of red, or as an appellative, meaning some kind of horse, there are\nothers in which, as I pointed out in my Essay on Comparative Mythology a,\nArusha occurs as a proper name, as the name of a solar deity, as the bright\ndeity of the morning (Morgenroth). My interpretation of some of these passages\nhas been contested, nor shall I deny that in some of them a different\ninterpretation is possible, and that in looking for traces of Arusha, as a\nVedic deity, representing the morning or the rising sun, and containing, as I\nendeavoured to show, the first germs of the Greek name of Eros, I may have\nseen more indications of the presence of that deity in the Veda than others\nwould feel inclined to acknowledge. Yet in going over the same ground again, I\nthink that even verses which for a time I felt inclined to surrender, yield a\nbetter sense, if we take the word arusha, which occurs in them as a\nsubstantive, as the name of a matutinal deity, than if we look upon it as an\nadjective or a mere appellative. It might be said that wherever this arusha\noccurs, apparently as the name of a deity, we ought to supply Agni or Indra or\nSurya. This is true to a certain extent, for the sun, or the light of the\nmorning, or the bright sky form no doubt the substance and\n\np. 21\n\nsubject-matter of this deity. But the same applies to many other names\noriginally intended for these conceptions, but which, nevertheless, in the\ncourse of time, became independent names of independent deities. In our\npassage I, 6, 1, yu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ anti bradhnam arusham, we may retain for arusha\nthe appellative power of steed or red-steed, but if we could ask the poet what\nhe meant by this red-steed, or if we ask ourselves what we can possibly\nunderstand by it, the answer would be, the morning sun, or the light of the\nmorning. In other passages, however, this meaning of red-steed is really no\nlonger applicable, and we can only translate Arusha by the Red, understanding\nby this name the deity of the morning or of the morning sun, the later Aru _n_\na.\n\nVII, 71, 1. apa svasu _h_ ushasa _h_ nak _g_ ihite _ri_ _n_ akti k _ri_ sh _n_\ni\xc2\xb4 _h_ arusha\xc2\xb4ya pantham.\n\nThe Night retires from her sister, the Dawn; the Dark one yields the path to\nthe Red one, i. e. the red morning.\n\nHere Arusha shares the same half-mythological character as Ushas. Where we\nshould speak of dawn and morning as mere periods of time, the Vedic poet\nspeaks of them as living and intelligent beings, half human, half divine, as\npowers of nature capable of understanding his prayers, and powerful enough to\nreward his praises. I do not think therefore that we need hesitate to take\nArusha in this passage as a proper name of the morning, or of the morning sun,\nto whom the dark goddess, the Night, yields the path when he rises in the\nEast.\n\nVI, 49, 2. diva _h_ _s_ i _s_ um sahasa _h_ sunum agnim ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya ketum\narusham ya _g_ adhyai.\n\nTo worship the child of Dyu, the son of strength, Agni, the light of the\nsacrifice, the Red one (Arusha.).\n\nIn this verse, where the name of Agni actually occurs, it would be easier than\nin the preceding verse to translate arusha as an adjective, referring it\neither to Agni, the god of fire, or to ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya ketum, the light of the\nsacrifice. I had myself yielded a so far to these considerations that I\n\np. 22\n\ngave up my former translation, and rendered this verse by 'to worship Agni,\nthe child of the sky, the son of strength, the red light of the sacrifice a.'\nBut I return to my original translation, and I prefer to see in Arusha an\nindependent name, intended, no doubt, for Agni, as the representative of the\nrising sun and, at the same time, of the sacrificial fire of the morning, but\nnevertheless as having in the mind of the poet a personality of his own. He is\nthe child of Dyu, originally the offspring of heaven. He is the son of\nstrength, originally generated by the strong rubbing of the ara _n_ is, i. e.\nthe wood for kindling fire. He is the light of the sacrifice, whether as\nreminding man that the time for the morning sacrifice has come, or as himself\nlighting the sacrifice on the Eastern altar of the sky. He is Arusha,\noriginally as clothed in bright red colour, but gradually changed into the\nrepresentative of the morning. We see at once, if examining these various\nexpressions, how some of them, like the child of Dyu, are easily carried away\ninto mythology, while others, such as the son of strength, or the light of the\nsacrifice, resist that unconscious metamorphosis. That Arusha was infected by\nmythology, that it had approached at least that point where nomina become\nchanged into numina, we see by the verse immediately following:\n\nVI, 49, 3. arushasya duhitara virupe (iti vi-rupe) st _r i_bhi _h_ anya\xc2\xb4 pipi\n_s_ e su\xc2\xb4ra _h_ anya\xc2\xb4.\n\nThere are two different daughters of Arusha; the one is clad in stars, the\nother belongs to the sun, or is the wife of Svar.\n\nHere Arusha is clearly a mythological being, like Agni or Savitar or Vai _s_\nvanara; and if Day and Night are called his daughters, he, too, can hardly\nhave been conceived otherwise than as endowed with human attributes, as the\nchild of Dyu, as the father of Day and Night, and not as a mere period of\ntime, not as a mere cause or effect.\n\nIV, 15, 6. tam arvantam na sanasim arusham na diva _h_ _s_ i _s_ um marm _ri_\n_g_ yante dive-dive.\n\np. 23\n\nThey trim the fire day by day, like a strong horse, like Arusha, the child of\nDyu.\n\nHere, too, Arusha, the child of Dyu, has to be taken as a personal character,\nand, if the na after arusham is right, a distinction is clearly made between\nAgni, the sacrificial fire, to whom the hymn is addressed, and Arusha, the\nchild of heaven, the pure and bright morning, here used as a simile for the\ncleaning or trimming of the fire on the altar.\n\nV, 47, 3. arusha _h_ su-par _n_ a _h_.\n\nArusha, the morning sun, with beautiful wings.\n\n#### The Feminine \xc3\x81rushi, as an Adjective.\n\n\xc3\x81rushi, like arusha, is used as an adjective, in the same sense as arusha, i.\ne. red:\n\nIII, 55, 11. _s_ ya\xc2\xb4vi _k_ a yat arushi _k_ a sva _s_ arau.\n\nAs the dark and the red are sisters.\n\nI, 92, 1 and 2. ga\xc2\xb4va _h_ arushi _h_ and arushi _h_ ga\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nThe red cows of the dawn.\n\nI, 92, 2. ru _s_ antam bhanum arushi _h_ a _s_ i _s_ rayu _h_.\n\nThe red dawns obtained bright splendour.\n\nHere ushasa _h_ , the dawns, occur in the same line, so that we may take\narushi _h_ either as an adjective, referring to the dawns, or as a\nsubstantive, as a name of the dawn or of her cows.\n\nI, 30, 21. a _s_ ve na _k_ itre arushi.\n\nThou beautiful red dawn, thou, like a mare.\n\nHere, too, the vocative arushi is probably to be taken as an adjective,\nparticularly if we consider the next following verse:\n\nIV, 52, 2. a _s_ va-iva _k_ itra\xc2\xb4 arushi mata\xc2\xb4 gavam _ri_ ta-vari sakha abhut\na _s_ vino _h_ usha\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nThe dawn, beautiful and red, like-a mare, the mother of the cows (days), the\nnever-failing, she became the friend of the A _s_ vins.\n\nX, 5, 5. sapta svas _r i_ _h_ arushi _h_.\n\nThe seven red sisters.\n\np. 24\n\n#### The Feminine \xc3\x81rushi, as a Substantive.\n\nIf used as a substantive, arushi seems to mean the dawn. It is likewise used\nas a name of the horses of Agni, Indra, and Soma; also as a name for mare in\ngeneral.\n\nIt means dawn in X, 8, 3, though the text points here so clearly to the dawn,\nand the very name of dawn is mentioned so immediately after, that this one\npassage seems hardly sufficient to establish the use of arushi as a recognised\nname of the dawn. Other passages, however, would likewise gain in perspicuity,\nif we took arushi by itself as a name of the dawn, just as we had to admit in\nseveral passages arusha by itself as a name of the morning. Cf. I, 71, 1.\n\n\xc3\x81rushi means the horses of Agni, in I, 14, 12:\n\nyukshva hi arushi _h_ rathe harita _h_ deva rohita _h_.\n\nYoke, O god (Agni), the red-horses to the chariot, the bays, the ruddy.\n\nI, 72, 10. pra ni\xc2\xb4 _k_ i _h_ agne arushi _h_ a _g_ anan.\n\nThey knew the red-horses, Agni, coming down. VIII, 69, 5.\n\nSoma, as we saw, was frequently spoken of as arusha _h_ hari _h_.\n\nIn IX, 111, 2, tridha\xc2\xb4tubhi _h_ arushibhi _h_ seems to refer to the same red-\nhorses of Soma, though this is not quite clear.\n\nThe passages where arushi means simply a mare, without any reference to\ncolour, are VIII, 68, 18, and VIII, 55, 3.\n\nIt is curious that Arusha, which in the Veda means red, should, as pointed out\nbefore, in its Zend form aurusha, mean white. That in the Veda it means red,\nand not white, is shown, for instance, by X, 20, 9, where _s_ veta, the name\nfor white, is mentioned by the side of arusha. Most likely arusha meant\noriginally brilliant, and became fixed with different shades of brilliancy in\nSanskrit and Persian. Arusha presupposes a form ar-vas, and is derived from a\nroot ar in the sense of running or rushing. See Chips from a German Workshop,\nvol. ii, pp. 135, 137.\n\np. 25\n\nHaving thus explained the different meanings of arusha and arushi in the Rig-\nveda, I feel it incumbent, at least for once, to explain the reasons why I\ndiffer from the classification of Vedic passages as given in the Dictionary\npublished by Boehtlingk and Roth. Here, too, the passages in which arusha is\nused as an adjective are very properly separated from those in which it\nappears as a substantive. To begin with the first, it is said that 'arusha\nmeans ruddy, the colour of Agni and his horses; he (Agni) himself appears as a\nred-horse.' In support of this, the following passages are quoted:\n\nIII, 1, 4. avardhayan su-bhagam sapta yahvi\xc2\xb4 _h_ _s_ vetam _g_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anam\narusham mahi-tva\xc2\xb4, _s_ i _s_ um na, _g_ atam abhi aru _h_ a _s_ va _h_. Here,\nhowever, it is only said that Agni was born brilliant-white a, and grew red,\nthat the horses came to him as they come to a new-born foal. Agni himself is\nnot called a red-horse.\n\nIII, 7, 5. Here, again, v _r i_sh _n_ a _h_ arushasya is no doubt meant for\nAgni. But v _r i_shan by itself does not mean horse, though it is added to\ndifferent names of horses to qualify them as male horses; cf. VII, 69, I, a\xc2\xb4\nvam ratha _h_ v _r i_shabhi _h_ yatu a _s_ vai _h_ , may your chariot come\nnear with powerful horses, i. e. with stallions. See note to I, 85, 12. We are\ntherefore not justified in translating arusha v _r i_shan by red-horse, but\nonly by the red male, or the red hero.\n\nIn III, 31, 3, agni _h_ _g_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ e _g_ uhva\xcc\x83 re _g_ amana _h_ maha\xc2\xb4 _h_\nputra\xc2\xb4n arushasya pra-yakshe, I do not venture to say who is meant by the maha\n_h_ putra\xc2\xb4n arushasya, whether \xc3\x82dityas or Maruts, but hardly the sons of Agni,\nas Agni himself is mentioned as only born. But, even if it were so, the father\nof these sons (putra) could hardly be intended here for a horse.\n\nIV, 6, 9. tava tye agne harita _h_ gh _ri_ ta-sna\xc2\xb4 _h_ rohitasa _h_ _ri_ _g_\nu-a _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _h_ su-a _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _h_ , arusha\xc2\xb4sa _h_ v _r i_sha _n_ a _h_ _ri_\n_g_ u-mushka\xc2\xb4 _h_. Here, so far from Agni being represented as a red-horse,\nhis different horses, the Harits or bays, the Rohitas or\n\np. 26\n\nruddy, and the arusha\xc2\xb4sa _h_ v _r i_sha _n_ a _h_ , the red stallions, are\ndistinctly mentioned. Here v _r i_shan may be translated by stallion, instead\nof simply by male, because arusha is here a substantive, the name of a horse.\n\nV, 1, 5. _g_ anish _t_ a hi _g_ enya _h_ agre ahnam hita _h_ hiteshu arusha\n_h_ vaneshu. Here arusha _h_ is simply an adjective, red, referring to Agni,\nwho is understood throughout the hymn to be the object of praise. He is said\nto be kind to those who are kind to him, and to be red in the woods, i. e.\nbrilliant in the wood which he consumes; cf. III, 29, 6. Nothing is said about\nhis equine nature.\n\nIn V, 12, 2 and 6, VI, 48, 6, we have again simply arusha v _r i_shan, which\ndoes not mean the red-horse, but the red male, the red hero, i. e. Agni.\n\nIn VI, 49, 2, diva _h_ _s_ i _s_ um sahasa _h_ sunum agnim ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya\nketum arusham ya _g_ adhyai, there is no trace of Agni being conceived as a\nhorse. He is called the child of the sky or of Dyu, the son of strength (who\nis produced by strong rubbing of wood), the light or the beacon of the\nsacrifice, and lastly Arusha, which, for reasons stated above, I take to be\nused here as a name.\n\nNext follow the passages in which, according to Professor Roth, arusha, as an\nadjective, is said to be applied to the horses, cows, and other teams of the\ngods, particularly of the dawn, the A _s_ vins, and B _ri_ haspati.\n\nI, 118, 5. pari vam a _s_ va _h_ vapusha _h_ pata\xe1\xb9\x85ga\xc2\xb4 _h_ vaya _h_ vahantu\narusha\xc2\xb4 _h_ abhi\xc2\xb4ke. Here we find the vaya _h_ arusha\xc2\xb4 _h_ of the A _s_ vins,\nwhich it is better to translate by red birds, as immediately before the winged\nhorses are mentioned. In fact, whenever arusha is applied to the vehicle of\nthe A _s_ vins, it is to be understood of these red birds, IV, 43, 6.\n\nIn I, 92, 1 and 2 (not 20), arushi occurs three times, referring twice to the\ncows of the dawn, once to the dawn herself.\n\nIn IV, 15, 6, tam arvantam na sanasim arusham na diva _h_ _s_ i _s_ um marm\n_ri_ _g_ yante dive-dive, arusha does not refer to the horse or any other\nanimal of Agni. The verse speaks of a horse by way of comparison only, and\nsays that the sacrificers clean or trim Agni, the fire, as people clean a\nhorse. We\n\np. 27\n\ncannot join arusham in the next pada with arvantam in the preceding pada, for\nthe second na would then be without any construction. The construction is\ncertainly not easy, but I think it is safer to translate: they trim him\n(Agni), day by day, as they clean a strong horse, as they clean Arusha, the\nchild of Dyu. In fact, as far as I know, arusha is never used as the name of\nthe one single horse belonging to Agni, but always of two or more.\n\nIn III, 31, 21, antar (iti) k _ri_ sh _n_ a\xc2\xb4n arushai _h_ dha\xc2\xb4ma bhi _h_ gat,\ndha\xc2\xb4ma bhi _h_ is said to mean flames of lightning. But dha\xc2\xb4man in the Rig-\nveda does not mean flames, and it seems better to translate, with thy red\ncompanies, scil. the Maruts.\n\nThat arusha in one or two passages means the red cloud, is true. But in X, 43,\n9, arusha refers to the thunderbolt mentioned in the same verse; and in I,\n114, 5, everything refers to Rudra, and not to a red cloud,, in the proper\nsense of the word.\n\nFurther on, where the meanings attributable to arushi in the Veda are\ncollected, it is said that arushi means a red mare, also the teams of Agni and\nUshas. Now, here, surely, a distinction should have been made between those\npassages in which arushi means a real horse, and those where it expresses the\nimaginary steeds of Agni. The former, it should be observed, occur in one Ma\n_n_ _d_ ala only, and in places of somewhat doubtful authority, in VIII, 55,\n3, a Valakhilya hymn, and in VIII, 68, 18, a danastuti or panegyric. Besides,\nno passage is given where arushi means the horses of the dawn, and I doubt\nwhether such a passage exists, while the one verse where arushi is really used\nfor the horses of Indra, is not mentioned at all. Lastly, two passages are set\napart where arushi is supposed to mean flames. Now, it may be perfectly true\nthat the red-horses of Agni are meant for flames, just as the red-horses of\nIndra may be the rays of the sun. But, in that case, the red-horses of Agni\nshould always have been thus translated, or rather interpreted, and not in one\npassage only. In IX, 111, 2, arushi is said to mean flames, but no further\nlight is thrown upon that very difficult passage.\n\np. 28\n\nNote 2. Pari tasthusha _h_. I take this form as a nominative plural like\nabibhyusha _h_ , I, 11, 5, tva\xc2\xb4m deva\xc2\xb4 _h_ abibhyusha _h_ tu _g_ yamanasa _h_\navishu _h_ , 'the gods, stirred up, came to thee, not fearing;' and like\ndadusha _h_ , I, 54, 8, ye te indra dadusha _h_ vardhayanti mahi kshatram,\n'who giving or by their gifts increase thy great power, O Indra.' Here we\nmight possibly take it as a gen. sing. referring to te, but dadivan is far\nmore appropriate as an epithet of the sacrificer than of the god. (See Benfey,\nVocativ, p. 24; and Hermes, p. 16.) It is well known among Sanskrit scholars\nthat Professor Whitney, in reviewing my translation, declared that the\nparticipial form tasthusha _h_ had no right to be anything but an accusative\nplural or a genitive or ablative singular. (See Chips from a German Workshop,\nvol. iv, p. 508.) Dr. Kern, however, in his translation of the B _ri_ hat-Sa\n_m_ hita had shown long before that nom. plur. such as vidusha _h_ are by no\nmeans rare, even in the Mahabharata and kindred works. Dr. Lanman (Journ.\nAmeric. Or. Soc. X, p. 513) has now entered abibhyusha _h_ as a nom. plur.,\nbut he prefers to take tasthusha _h_ as an acc. plural, so that we should have\nto translate _k_ arantam pari tasthusha _h_ by 'walking round those who\nstand.' This may be grammatically possible; but who could be meant by\ntasthusha _h_ , standing ones? And, secondly, is it usual in Vedic Sanskrit to\nsay _k_ arati pari tam, he walks round him?' We find pari ta _m_ yati, or tam\npari yati, but hardly yati pari tam, 'he goes round him,' except when pari\nstands independent of the verb and means 'around,' e. g. IX, 72, 8, pavasva\npari pa\xc2\xb4rthivam ra _g_ a _h_. It is more difficult to decide whether we should\nadopt Ludwig's interpretation, who takes pari tasthusha _h_ in the sense of\n'away from what is firm.' This is correct grammatically, and tasthivat, as\nopposed to _g_ agat, is often used in the sense of what is immovable. But is\nit ever used in that sense by itself? I doubt it, though I may add in support\nof it such a passage as I, 191, 9, ut apaptat asau su\xc2\xb4rya _h_ \xe2\x80\xa6 aditya _h_\nparvatebhya _h_ , a verse where the expression vi _s_ vad _ri_ sh _t_ a _h_ ad\n_r i_sh _t_ aha\xc2\xb4 is analogous to our ketum k _ri_ _n_ van aketave. I therefore\nretain pari tasthusha _h_ as a nom. plural in the sense of standing around,\ncircumstantes, possibly of pari _k_ ara,\n\np. 29\n\nattendants. Parish _th_ ana or sthana comes to mean an abode, and\nparitasthivantas would be bystanders, attendants, the people, in fact, who are\nsupposed to harness the horse.\n\nThough I do not assign great weight to interpretations of hymns, as given by\nthe Brahma _n_ as, I may mention that in the Taitt. Br. III, 9, 4, I,\nparitasthusha _h_ is explained as a nom. plur., ime vai loka _h_ paritasthusha\n_h_ , while Saya _n_ a in his commentary (Sama-veda II, 6, 3, 12, i) has\nparito\xe0\xa4\xbdvasthita lokatrayavartina _h_ pra _n_ ina _h_.\n\nNote 3. Ro _k_ ante ro _k_ ana\xc2\xb4. A similar expression occurs III, 61, 5, where\nit is said of Ushas, the dawn, that she lighted the lights in the sky, pra ro\n_k_ ana\xc2\xb4 ruru _k_ e ra _n_ vasand _ri_ k.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nWilson: They (the charioteers) harness to his car his two desirable coursers,\nplaced on either hand, bay-coloured, high-spirited, chief-bearing.\n\nBenfey: Die lieben Falben schirren sie zu beiden Seiten des Wagens an, braune,\nkuhne, held-tragende.\n\nLudwig: Sie spannen seine lieblichen falben an den wagen mit\nauseinandergehenden seiten, die blutroten, mutigen, helden-bringenden.\n\nNote 1. Although no name is given, the pronoun asya clearly refers to Indra,\nfor it is he to whom the two bays belong. The next verse, therefore, must\nlikewise be taken as addressed to Indra, and not to the sun or the morning-\nred, spoken of as a horse or a chariot in the first verse.\n\nVipakshasa is well explained by Saya _n_ a, vividhe pakshasi rathasya par _s_\nvau yayos tau vipakshasau, rathasya dvayo _h_ par _s_ vayor yo _g_ itav ity\nartha _h_. The only doubt is whether it refers to the two sides of the\nchariot, or of the principal horse. That horses were sometimes yoked so that\none should act as leader, and two should be harnessed on each side, we see in\nI, 39, 6, note.\n\np. 30\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nWilson: Mortals, you owe your (daily) birth (to such an Indra), who, with the\nrays of the morning, gives sense to the senseless, and to the formless, form.\n\nBenfey: Licht machend--Manner!--das Dunkele and kenntlich das Unkenntliche,\nentsprangst du mit dem Morgenroth.\n\nLudwig: Sichtbarkeit schaffend dem unsichtbaren, gestalt o schmuckreiche\n(Marut) dem gestaltlosen, wurdet ihr mit den Ushas zusammen geboren.\n\nNote 1. In the TB. III, 9, 4, several of these mantras are enjoined for the A\n_s_ vamedha. When the banner (dhva _g_ a) is fastened, this verse is to be\nused, because ketu was supposed to mean a banner. The vocative marya _h_ ,\nwhich I have translated by O men, had evidently become a mere exclamation at a\nvery early time. Even in our passage it is clear that the poet does not\naddress any men in particular, for he addresses Indra, nor is marya used in\nthe general sense of men. It means males, or male offspring. It sounds more\nlike some kind of asseveration or oath, like the Latin mehercle, or like the\nEnglish O ye powers, and it is therefore quoted as a nipata or particle in the\nVa _g_. Prati _s_. II, 16. It can hardly be taken here as addressed to the\nMaruts, though the Maruts are the subject of the next verse. Kluge in Kuhn's\nZeitschrift, vol. xxv, p. 309, points out that marya _h_ as an interjection\ndoes not occur again in the Rig-veda. But the Rig-veda contains many words\nwhich occur once only, and the author of Va _g_. Prati _s_ akhya is no mean\nauthority. See also Ta _n_ _d_ ya Brahm. VII, 6, 5. If Dr. Kluge proposes to\nread maryai as a dative (like \xce\xbb\xe1\xbd\xbb\xce\xba\xe1\xbf\xb3) he knows, of course, that such a form does\nnot only never occur again in the Rig-veda, but never in the whole of Sanskrit\nliterature. Grassmann and Lanman (N. I., p. 339) both seem to imagine that the\nPada text has marya, but it has marya _h_ , and no accent. If marya _h_ had\nthe accent, we might possibly translate, 'the youths, i. e. the Maruts, made,'\ntaking k _ri_ _n_ van for ak _ri_ _n_ van, or the more usual akurvan; but in\nthat case the transition to a _g_ ayatha _h_ would be very sudden. See,\nhowever, I, 6, 7.\n\np. 31\n\nSaya _n_ a explains it marya _h_ , manushya _h_! idam a _s_ _k_ aryam pa _s_\nyata. Another explanation of this verse, which evidently troubled the ancient\ncommentators as much as us, is, 'O mortal, i. e. O sun (dying daily), thou\nhast been born with the dawn.'\n\nNote 2. Ushadbhi _h_ , an instrumental plural which attracted the attention of\nthe author of the Varttika to Pa _n_. VII, 4, 48. It occurs but once, but the\nregular form, ushobhi _h_ , does not occur at all in the Rig-veda. The same\ngrammarian mentions mas, month, as changing the final s of its base into d\nbefore bhis. This, too, is confirmed by RV. II, 24, 5, where madbhi _h_\noccurs. Two other words, svavas, offering good protection, and svatavas, of\nindependent strength, mentioned together as liable to the same change, do not\noccur with bhi _h_ in the Rig-veda, but the forms svavadbhi _h_ and\nsvatavadbhi _h_ probably occurred in some other Vedic writings. Svatavadbhya\n_h_ has been pointed out by Professor Aufrecht in the Va _g_ asan. Sa _m_ hita\nXXIV, 16, and svatavobhya _h_ in _S_ atap. Br. II, 5, I, 14. That the nom.\nsvavan, which is always trisyllabic, is not to be divided into sva-van, as\nproposed by _S_ akalya, but into su-avan, is implied by Varttika to Pa _n_.\nVIII, 4, 48, and distinctly stated in the Siddhanta-Kaumudi. That the final n\nof the nom. su-avan disappeared before semi-vowels is confirmed by the Sakala-\nprati _s_ akhya, Sutra 287; see also Va _g_ asan. Prati _s_. III, Sutra 135\n(Weber, Ind. Stud. vol. iv, p. 206). On the proper division of su-avas, see\nAufrecht, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, vol. xiii,\np. 499.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nWilson: Thereafter, verily, those who bear names invoked in holy rites (the\nMaruts), having seen the rain about to be engendered, instigated him to resume\nhis embryo condition (in the clouds).\n\nBenfey: Sodann von freien Stucken gleich erregen wieder Schwangerschaft die\nheilgen Namen tragenden.\n\nLudwig: Da haben namlich in ihrer gottlichen weise dise der P _ri_ _s_ ni\nleibesfrucht gebracht, opfer verdienenden namen erwerbend.\n\np. 32\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x82t must here take vyuha and be pronounced as an iambus. This is\nexceptional with at, but there are at least two other passages where the same\npronunciation is necessary. I, 148, 4, a\xc2\xb4t ro _k_ ate vane a\xc2\xb4 vi-bha\xc2\xb4-va,\nthough in the line immediately following it is monosyllabic. Also in V, 7, 10,\na\xc2\xb4t agne apri _n_ ata _h_.\n\nNote 2. Svadha\xc2\xb4, literally one's own place, afterwards, one's own nature. It\nwas a great triumph for the science of Comparative Philology that, long before\nthe existence of such a word as svadha in Sanskrit was known, it should have\nbeen postulated by Professor Benfey in his Griechisches Wurzellexicon,\npublished in 1839, and in the appendix of 1842. Svadha\xc2\xb4 was known, it is true,\nin the ordinary Sanskrit, but there it only occurred as an exclamation used on\npresenting an oblation to the manes. It was also explained to mean food\noffered to deceased ancestors, or to be the name of a personification of Maya\nor worldly illusion, or of a nymph. But Professor Benfey, with great\ningenuity, postulated for Sanskrit a noun svadha\xc2\xb4, as corresponding to the\nGreek \xe1\xbc\x94\xce\xb8\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 and the German sitte, O. H. G. sit-u, Gothic sid-u. The noun svadha\nhas since been discovered in the Veda, where it occurs very frequently; and\nits true meaning in many passages where native tradition had entirely\nmisunderstood it, has really been restored by means of its etymological\nidentification with the Greek \xe1\xbc\x94\xce\xb8\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 or \xe1\xbc\xa6\xce\xb8\xce\xbf\xcf\x82. See Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. ii,\np. 134; vol. xii, p. 158.\n\nThe expressions anu svadha\xc2\xb4m and svadha\xc2\xb4m anu are of frequent occurrence. They\nmean, according to the nature or character of the persons spoken of, and may\nbe translated by as usual, or according to a person's wont. Thus in our\npassage we may translate, The Maruts are born again, i. e. as soon as Indra\nappeared with the dawn, according to their wont; they are always born as soon\nas Indra appears, for such is their nature.\n\nI, 165, 5. indra svadha\xc2\xb4m anu hi na _h_ babhu\xc2\xb4tha.\n\nFor, Indra, according to thy wont, thou art with us.\n\nVIII, 20, 7. svadha\xc2\xb4m anu _s_ riyam nara _h_ --vahante. According to their\nwont, the men (the Maruts) carry splendour.\n\np. 33\n\nThou hast grown (Indra) according to thy nature.\n\nIV, 33, 6. anu svadha\xc2\xb4m _ri_ bhava _h_ _g_ agmu _h_ eta\xc2\xb4m.\n\nAccording to their nature, the _Ri_ bhus went to her, scil. the cow; or,\naccording to this their nature, they came.\n\nIV, 52, 6; I, 33, 11; I, 88, 6; VII, 56, 13; III, 51, 11.\n\nIn all these passages svadha\xc2\xb4 may be rendered by manner, habit, usage, and anu\nsvadha\xc2\xb4m would seem to correspond to the Greek \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xbe \xe1\xbc\x94\xce\xb8\xce\xbf\xcf\x85\xcf\x82. Yet the history of\nthese words in Sanskrit and Greek has not been exactly the same. First of all\nwe observe in Greek a division between \xe1\xbc\x94\xce\xb8\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 and \xe1\xbc\xa6\xce\xb8\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, and whereas the former\ncomes very near in meaning to the Sanskrit svadha, the latter shows in Homer a\nmuch more primitive and material sense. It means in Homer, not a person's own\nnature, but the own place, for instance, of animals, the haunts of horses,\nlions, fish; in Hesiod, also of men. Hom. Il. XV, 268, \xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xcf\x84\xce\xac \xcf\x84\xe1\xbe\xbd \xe1\xbc\xa4\xce\xb8\xce\xb5\xce\xb1 \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb8\xce\xbd\n\xe1\xbc\xb5\xcf\x80\xcf\x80\xcf\x89\xce\xbd, loca consueta et pascua. Svadha\xc2\xb4 in the Veda does not occur in that\nsense, although etymologically it might take the meaning of one's own place:\ncf. dha-man, familia, &c. Whether in Greek \xe1\xbc\xa6\xce\xb8\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, from meaning lair, haunt,\nhome, came, like \xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82 and \xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, to mean habit, manner, character, which\nwould be quite possible, or whether \xe1\xbc\xa6\xce\xb8\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 in that meaning represents a second\nstart from the same point, which in Sanskrit was fixed in svadha\xc2\xb4, is\nimpossible to determine. In Sanskrit svadha\xc2\xb4 clearly shows the meaning of\none's own nature, power, disposition. It does not mean power or nature in\ngeneral, but always the power of some one, the peculiarity, the individuality\nof a person. This will appear from the following passages:\n\nII, 3, 8. tisra _h_ devi\xc2\xb4 _k_ svadhaya barhi _h_ a\xc2\xb4 idam a _k_ _kh_ idram\npantu.\n\nMay the three goddesses protect by their power the sacred pile unbroken.\n\nIV, 13, 5. kaya yati svadhaya.\n\nBy what inherent power does he (the Sun) move on?\n\nIV, 26, 4. a _k_ akraya svadhaya.\n\nBy a power which requires no chariot, i. e. by himself without a chariot.\n\nThe same expression occurs again X, 27, 19.\n\np. 34\n\nIn some places the verb mad, to delight, joined with svadhaya, seems to mean\nto revel in his strength, to be proud of his might.\n\nV, 32, 4. svadhaya madantam.\n\nV _ri_ tra who delights in his strength.\n\nVII, 47, 3. svadhaya madanti _h_.\n\nThe waters who delight in their strength. See X, 124, 8.\n\nIn other passages, however, as we shall see, the same phrase (and this is\nrather unusual) requires to be taken in a different sense, so as to mean to\nrejoice in food.\n\nI, 164, 38; III, 17, 5.\n\nIII, 35, 10. indra piba svadhaya _k_ it sutasya agne _h_ va pahi _g_ ihvaya ya\n_g_ atra.\n\nIndra drink of the libation by thyself (by thy own power), or with the tongue\nof Agni, O worshipful.\n\nTo drink with the tongue of Agni is a bold but not unusual expression. V, 51,\n2. agne _h_ pibata _g_ ihvaya. X, 15, 3.\n\nI, 165, 6. kva\xc2\xb4 sya\xc2\xb4 va _h_ maruta _h_ svadha\xc2\xb4 asit yat ma\xc2\xb4m ekam sam-adhatta\nahi-hatye.\n\nWhere was that custom of yours, O Maruts, when you left me alone in the\nkilling of Ahi?\n\nVII, 8, 3. kaya na _h_ agne vi vasa _h_ su-v _ri_ ktim ka\xc2\xb4m um (iti) svadha\xc2\xb4m\n_ri_ _n_ ava _h_ _s_ asyamana _h_.\n\nIn what character dost thou light up our work, and what character dost thou\nassume, when thou art praised?\n\nIV, 58, 4; IV, 45, 6.\n\nI, 64, 4. sakam _g_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ire svadhaya.\n\nThey (the Maruts) were born together, according to their nature; very much\nlike anu svadha\xc2\xb4m, I, 6, 4. One can hardly render it here by 'they were born\nby their own strength,' or 'by spontaneous generation.'\n\nIn other passages, however, svadhaya, meaning originally by its own power, or\nnature, comes to mean, by itself, sponte sua.\n\nVII, 78, 4. a\xc2\xb4 asthat ratham svadhaya yu _g_ yamanam.\n\nShe, the dawn, mounted the chariot which was harnessed by itself, by its own\npower, without requiring the assistance of people to put the horses to.\n\np. 35\n\nX, 129, 2. a\xc2\xb4nit avatam svadhaya tat ekam.\n\nThat only One breathed breathlessly (or freely) by its own strength, i. e. by\nitself.\n\nIn the same sense svadha\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ is used in several passages: I, 113, 13. am\n_r i_ta _k_ arati svadha\xc2\xb4bhi _h_.\n\nThe immortal Dawn moves along by her own strength, i. e. by herself.\n\nVIII, 10, 6. yat va svadha\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ adhi-tisht _h_ atha _h_ ratham.\n\nOr whether ye mount your chariot by your own strength, ye A _s_ vins.\n\nI, 164, 30. _g_ iva _h_ m _ri_ tasya _k_ arati svadha\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ amartya _h_\nmartyena sa-yoni _h_.\n\nThe living moves by the powers of the dead, the immortal is the brother of the\nmortal. III, 26, 8; V, 60, 4.\n\nThere are doubtful passages, such as I, 180, 6, in which the meaning of\nsvadha\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ , too, is doubtful. In VI, 2, 8, svadha\xc2\xb4 looks like an adverb,\ninstead of svadhaya, and would then refer to pari _g_ ma. The same applies to\nVIII, 32, 6.\n\nBut svadha\xc2\xb4 means also food, lit. one's own portion, the sacrificial offering\ndue to each god, and lastly, food in general.\n\nI, 108, 12. yat indragni (iti) ut-ita su\xc2\xb4ryasya madhye diva _h_ svadhaya\nmadayethe (iti).\n\nWhether you, Indra and Agni, delight in your food at the rising of the sun or\nat midday.\n\nX, 15, 12. tvam agne i _li_ ta _h_ _g_ ata-veda _h_ ava _t_ havya\xc2\xb4ni surabhi\xc2\xb4\n_n_ i k _ri_ tvi\xc2\xb4, pra ada _h_ pit _r i_-bhya _h_ svadhaya te akshan addhi\ntvam deva pra-yata havi\xc2\xb4 _m_ shi. 13. ye _k_ a iha pitara _h_ ye _k_ a na iha\nya\xc2\xb4n _k_ a vidma ya\xc2\xb4n u _m_ (iti) _k_ a na pra-vidma, tvam vettha yati te _g_\nata-veda _h_ svadha\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am suk _ri_ tam _g_ ushasva. 14. ye\nagni-dagdha\xc2\xb4 _h_ ye anagni-dagdha _h_ madhye diva _h_ svadhaya madayante,\ntebhi _h_ sva-ra\xc2\xb4 _t_ asunitim eta\xc2\xb4m yatha-va _s_ am tanva\xc2\xb4m kalpayasva.\n\n12\\.

Our fathers who\nare here, and those who are not here, our fathers whom we know and those whom\nwe do not know, thou knowest\n\np. 36\n\nhow many they are, O Gatavedas, accept the well-made sacrifice with the\nsacrificial portions. 14. They who, whether burnt by fire or not burnt by\nfire, rejoice in their offering in the midst of heaven, give to them, O king,\nthat life, and thy (their) own body, according to thy will.\n\nIII, 4, 7. sapta p _ri_ ksha\xc2\xb4sa _h_ svadhaya madanti.\n\nThe seven horses delight in their food.\n\nX, 14, 7. ubha\xc2\xb4 ra\xc2\xb4 _g_ ana svadhaya madanta.\n\nThe two kings delighting in their food.\n\nIX, 113, 10. yatra ka\xc2\xb4ma _h_ ni-kama\xc2\xb4 _h_ _k_ a, yatra bradhnasya vish _t_\napam, svadha\xc2\xb4 _k_ a yatra t _r i_pti _h_ ka tatra ma\xc2\xb4m am _r i_tam k _ri_ dhi.\n\nWhere wishes and desires are, where the cup of the bright Soma is (or, where\nthe highest place of the sun is), where there is food and rejoicing, there\nmake me immortal.\n\nI, 154, 4. yasya tri\xc2\xb4 pur _n_ a\xc2\xb4 madhuna pada\xc2\xb4ni akshiyama _n_ a svadhaya\nmadanti.\n\nHe (Vish _n_ u) whose three places, full of sweet, imperishable, delight or\nabound in food.\n\nV, 34, 1; II, 35, 7; I, 168, 9; I, 176, 2.\n\nIn the tenth book svadha is used very much as it occurs in the later Sanskrit,\nas the name of a peculiar sacrificial rite.\n\nX, 14, 3. ya\xc2\xb4n _k_ a deva\xc2\xb4 _h_ vav _ri_ dhu _h_ ye ka deva\xc2\xb4n sva\xc2\xb4ha anye\nsvadhaya anye madanti.\n\nThose whom the gods cherish, and those who cherish the gods, the one delight\nin Svaha, the others in Svadha; or, in praise and food.\n\nNote 3. The expression garbha-tvam a-irire is matched by that of III, 60, 3,\nsaudhanvana\xc2\xb4sa _h_ am _ri_ ta-tvam a\xc2\xb4 irire, the Saudhanvanas (the _Ri_ bhus)\nobtained immortality, or became immortal. I do not think that punar erire can\nmean, as Ludwig supposes, they pushed away their state of garbha. The idea\nthat the Maruts assumed the form of a garbha, lit. of an embryo or a new-born\nchild, is only meant to express that they were born, or that the storms burst\nforth from the womb of the sky as soon as Indra arises to do battle against\nthe demon of darkness. Thus we read, I, 134, 4, a _g_ anaya _h_ maruta _h_\nvaksha _n_ abhya _h_ , Thou, Vayu, hast produced the Maruts from the bowels\n(of the sky).\n\np. 37\n\n[paragraph continues] As assisting Indra in this battle, the Maruts, whose\nname retained for a long time its purely appellative meaning of storms,\nattained their rank as deities by the side of Indra, or, as the poet expresses\nit, they assumed their sacred name. This seems to be the whole meaning of the\nlater legend that the Maruts, like the _Ri_ bhus, were not originally gods,\nbut became deified for their works. See also Kern, Translation of B _ri_ hat-\nsa _m_ hita, p. 117, note.\n\nOther explanations are: they made that which was born within the cloud into a\ngarbha or embryo; or, they arose with \xc3\x82ditya, proceeded with Savitar, and when\nSavitar set, they became again garbhas; see Sama-veda II, 2, 7, 2, comm.\n\n##### Vahni.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nWilson: Associated with the conveying Maruts, the traversers of places\ndifficult of access, thou, Indra, hast discovered the cows hidden in the cave.\n\nBenfey: Mit den die Festen brechenden, den Stu\xc2\xb4rmenden fandst, Indra, du die\nKu\xc2\xb4he in der Grotte gar.\n\nLudwig: Und mit denen, die das feste sogar anbrechen, selbst im versteck, o\nIndra, mit den priesterlichen, fandest du die morgenstralen auf.\n\nNote 1. Saya _n_ a explains vahnibhi _h_ in the sense of Marudbhi _h_ , and he\ntells the oft-repeated story how the cows were carried off by the Pa _n_ is\nfrom the world of the gods, and thrown into darkness, and how Indra with the\nMaruts conquered them and brought them back. Everybody seems to have accepted\nthis explanation of Saya _n_ a, and I myself do not venture to depart from it.\nYet it should be stated that the use of vahni as a name of the Maruts is by no\nmeans well established. Vahni is in fact a most difficult word in the Veda. In\nlater Sanskrit it means fire, and is quoted also as a name of Agni, the god of\nfire, but we do not learn why a word which etymologically means carrier, from\nvah, to carry, should have assumed the meaning of fire. It may be that vah,\nwhich in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin means chiefly to carry, expressed\noriginally\n\np. 38\n\nthe idea of moving about (the German be-wegen), in which case vah-ni, fire,\nwould have been formed with the same purpose as ag-ni, ig-nis, fire, from Sk.\na _g_ , \xe1\xbc\x80\xce\xb3-\xcf\x89, ag-o. In Alvis-mal, V, 94, we read, kalla Vag Vanir, the Wanes\ncall fire Vag, i. e. wavy. But in Sanskrit Agni is so constantly represented\nas the carrier of the sacrificial oblation, that something may also be said in\nfavour of the Indian scholastic interpreters who take vahni, as applied to\nAgni, in the sense of carrier. However that may be, it admits of no doubt that\nvahni, in the Veda, is distinctly applied to the bright fire or light. In some\npassages it looks very much like a proper name of Agni, in his various\ncharacters of terrestrial and celestial light. It is used for the sacrificial\nfire:\n\nV, 50, 4. yatra vahni _h_ abhi-hita _h_.\n\nWhere the sacrificial fire is placed.\n\nIt is applied to Agni:\n\nVII, 7, 5. asadi v _ri_ ta _h_ vahni _h_ a- _g_ aganva\xc2\xb4n agni _h_ brahma\xc2\xb4.\n\nThe chosen light came nigh, and sat down, Agni, the priest.\n\nHere Agni is, as usual, represented as a priest, chosen like a priest, for the\nperformance of the sacrifice. But, for that very reason, vahni may here have\nthe meaning of priest, which, as we shall see, it has in many places, and the\ntranslation would then be more natural: He, the chosen minister, came near and\nsat down, Agni, the priest.\n\nVIII, 23, 3. vahni _h_ vindate vasu.\n\nAgni finds wealth (for those who offer sacrifices?).\n\nMore frequently vahni is applied to the celestial Agni, or other solar\ndeities, where it is difficult to translate it in English except by an\nadjective:\n\nIII, 5,i. apa dva\xc2\xb4ra tamasa _h_ vahni _h_ avar (ity ava _h_ ).\n\nAgni opened the two doors of darkness.\n\nI, 160, 3. sa _h_ vahni _h_ putra _h_ pitro _h_ pavitra-van puna\xc2\xb4ti dhi\xc2\xb4ra _h_\nbhuvanani mayaya.\n\nThat light, the son of the two parents, full of brightness, the wise,\nbrightens the world by his power.\n\nAgni is even called vahni-tama (IV, I, 4), which hardly means more than the\nbrightest.\n\np. 39\n\nII, 17, 4. a\xc2\xb4t rodasi (iti) gyotisha vahni _h_ a\xc2\xb4 atanot.\n\nThen the bright (Indra) stretched out or filled heaven and earth with his\nlight.\n\nII, 38, I. ut u _m_ (iti) sya _h_ deva _h_ savita\xc2\xb4--vahni _h_ asthat. The\ndivine Savitar, the luminous, arose.\n\nBesides this meaning of light or fire, however, there are clearly two other\nmeanings of vahni which must be admitted in the Veda, first that of a carrier,\nvehicle, and, it may be, horse; secondly that of minister or priest.\n\nVI, 57, 3. a _g_ a\xc2\xb4 _h_ anyasya vahnaya _h_ hari (iti) anyasya sambh _ri_ ta.\n\nThe bearers of the one (Pushan) are goats, the bays are yoked for the other\n(Indra).\n\nI, 14, 6. gh _ri_ ta-p _ri_ sh _th_ a _h_ mana _h_ -yuga _h_ ye tva vahanti\nvahnaya _h_.\n\nThe horses with shining backs, obedient to thy will, which carry thee (Agni).\n\nVIII, 3, 23. yasmai anye da _s_ a prati dhuram vahanti vahnaya _h_.\n\nA horse against whom other ten horses carry a weight; i. e. it requires ten\nhorses to carry the weight which this one horse carries. (See X, II, 7.\nvahamana _h_ a _s_ vai _h_.)\n\nII, 37, 3. medyantu te vahnaya _h_ yebhi _h_ i\xc2\xb4yase.\n\nMay thy horses be fat on which thou goest. II, 24, 13.\n\nI, 44, 13. _s_ rudhi _s_ rut-kar _n_ a vahni-bhi _h_.\n\nAgni, who hast ears to hear, hear, on thy horses. Unless vahni-bhi _h_ is\njoined with the words that follow, devai _h_ saya\xc2\xb4va-bhi _h_.\n\nIII, 6, 2. va _k_ yantam te vahnaya _h_ sapta- _g_ ihva _h_  a.\n\nMay thy seven-tongued horses be called. Here vahnaya _h_ is clearly meant for\nthe flames of Agni, yet I doubt whether we should be justified in dropping the\nsimile, as the plural of vahni is nowhere used in the bald sense of flames.\n\nIn one passage vahni is supposed to be used as a feminine, or at all events\napplied to a feminine subject:\n\nVIII, 94, 1. yukta\xc2\xb4 vahni _h_ rathanam.\n\np. 40\n\nShe is yoked as the drawer of the chariots. Probably, however, vahni _h_\nshould here be changed into vahni.\n\nThe passages in which vahni is applied to Soma in the ninth and tenth Ma _n_\n_d_ alas throw little light on the subject. (IX, 9, 6; 20, 5; 6; 36, 2; 64,\n19; 89, 1; X, 101, 10.)\n\nInstead of vi _s_ a\xc2\xb4m vi _s_ pati _h_ , lord of men (VII, 7, 4), we find IX,\n108, 10. vi _s_ a\xc2\xb4m vahni _h_ na vi _s_ pati _h_. One feels inclined to\ntranslate here vahni _h_ by leader, but it is more likely that vahni is here\nagain the common name of Soma, and that it is inserted between vi _s_ a\xc2\xb4m na\nvi _s_ pati _h_ , which is meant to form one phrase.\n\nIn IX, 97, 34, tisra _h_ va\xc2\xb4 _k_ a _h_ irayati pra vahni _h_ , we may take\nvahni as the common appellation of Soma. But it may also mean minister or\npriest, as in the passages which we have now to examine. Cf. X, 11, 6.\n\nFor besides these passages in which vahni clearly means vector, carrier,\ndrawer, horse, there is a large class of verses in which it can only be\ntranslated by minister, i. e. officiating minister, and, as it would seem,\nchiefly singer or reciter a.\n\nThe verb vah was used in Sanskrit in the sense of carrying out (ud-vah,\nausfuhren), or performing a rite, particularly as applied to the reciting of\nhymns. Hence such compounds as uktha-vahas or stoma-vahas, offering hymns of\npraise, and ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a-vahas. Thus we read\n\nV, 79, 4. abhi ye tva vibha-vari stomai _h_ g _ri_ _n_ anti vahnaya _h_.\n\nThe ministers who praise thee, splendid Dawn, with hymns.\n\nI, 48, 11, ye tva g _ri_ _n_ anti vahnaya _h_.\n\nThe ministers who praise thee.\n\nVII, 75, 5. usha\xc2\xb4 _h_ u _k_ _kh_ ati vahni-bhi _h_ g _ri_ _n_ ana\xc2\xb4.\n\nThe dawn lights up, praised by the ministers.\n\nVI, 39, 1. mandrasya kave _h_ divyasya vahne _h_.\n\nOf the sweet poet, of the heavenly priest \xe2\x80\xa6\n\nVII, 82, 4. yuva\xc2\xb4m it yut-su p _r i_tanasu vahnaya _h_ yuva\xc2\xb4m kshemasya pra-\nsave mita- _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ava _h_ , i _s_ ana\xc2\xb4 vasva _h_ ubhayasya karava _h_\nindravaru _n_ a su-hava havamahe.\n\np. 41\n\nWe, as ministers, invoke you only in fights and battles; we, as suppliants,\n(invoke) you for the granting of treasure; we, as poets, (invoke) you, the\nlords of twofold wealth, you, Indra and Varu _n_ a, who listen to our call.\n\nVI, 32, 3. sa _h_ vahni-bhi _h_ _r i_kva-bhi _h_ goshu _s_ a _s_ vat mita _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ u-bhi _h_ puru-k _r i_tva _g_ igaya.\n\nHe (Indra) was victorious often among the cows, always with celebrating and\nsuppliant ministers.\n\nI have placed these two passages together because they seem to me to\nillustrate each other, and to show that although in the second passage the\ncelebrating and suppliant ministers may be intended for the Maruts, yet no\nargument could be drawn from this verse in favour of vahni by itself meaning\nthe Maruts. See also VIII, 6, 2; 12, 15; X, 114, 2.\n\nIV, 21, 6. hota ya _h_ na _h_ maha\xc2\xb4n sam-vara _n_ eshu vahni _h_.\n\nThe Hotar who is our great priest in the sanctuaries.\n\nI, 128, 4. vahni _h_ vedha\xc2\xb4 _h_ a _g_ ayata.\n\nBecause the wise priest (Agni) was born.\n\nThe same name which in these passages is applied to Agni, is in others, and,\nas it will be seen, in the same sense, applied to Indra.\n\nII, 21, 2. tuvi-graye vahnaye.\n\nTo the strong-voiced priest or leader.\n\nThe fact that vahni is followed in several passages by ukthai _h_ would seem\nto show that the office of the vahni was chiefly that of recitation or of\naddressing prayers to the gods.\n\nIII, 20, 1. agnim ushasam a _s_ vina dadhi-kra\xc2\xb4m vi-ush _t_ ishu havate vahni\n_h_ ukthai _h_.\n\nThe priest at the break of day calls with his hymns Agni, Ushas, the A _s_\nvins, and Dadhikra.\n\nI, 184, 1. ta\xc2\xb4 vam adya tau aparam huvema u _k_ _kh_ antyam ushasi vahni _h_\nukthai _h_.\n\nLet us invoke the two A _s_ vins to-day and to-morrow, the priest with his\nhymns is there when the dawn appears.\n\nIn a similar sense, it would seem, as vahni _h_ ukthai _h_ , the Vedic poets\nfrequently use the words vahni _h_ asa\xc2\xb4. This asa\xc2\xb4 is the instrumental\nsingular of as, mouth, and it is used\n\np. 42\n\nin other phrases also of the mouth as the instrument of praise.\n\nVI, 32, 1. va _g_ ri _n_ e sam-tamani va _k_ a _m_ si asa\xc2\xb4 sthaviraya taksham.\n\nI have shaped with my mouth blessed words to the wielder of the thunderbolt,\nthe strong Indra.\n\nX, 115, 3. asa\xc2\xb4 vahnim na _s_ o _k_ isha vi-rap _s_ inam.\n\nHe who sings with his flame as the poet with his mouth. See also I, 38, 14.\nmimihi _s_ lokam asye\xcc\x83, make a song in thy mouth.\n\nThus we find vahni _h_ asa\xc2\xb4 in the same place in the sixth and seventh Ma _n_\n_d_ alas (VI, 16, 9; VII, 16, 9), in the phrase vahni _h_ asa\xc2\xb4 vidu _h_ -tara\n_h_ , applied to Agni in the sense of the priest wise with his mouth, or\ntaking vahni _h_ asa\xc2\xb4 as it were one word, the wise poet.\n\nI, 129, 5. vahni _h_ asa\xc2\xb4, vahni _h_ na _h_ a _k_ _kh_ a.\n\nIndra, as a priest by his lips, as a priest coming towards us.\n\nFrom the parallelism of this passage it would seem that Professor Roth\nconcluded the meaning of asa\xc2\xb4 a to be near,\n\np. 43\n\nor coram. In the Nigha _n_ _t_ u, II, 16, the right reading is evidently asat,\nnot asa; see Nirukta, ed. Satyavrata Sama _s_ rami, vol. i, p. 264. \xc3\x82sa\xc2\xb4,\nhowever, is an old variant, as may be seen from Rig-veda-bhashya I, 127, 8; X,\n115, 3.\n\nI, 76, 4. pra _g_ a\xc2\xb4-vata va _k_ asa vahni _h_ asa\xc2\xb4 a\xc2\xb4 _k_ a huve ni _k_ a\nsatsi iha devai _h_.\n\nWith words in which my people join, I, the poet, invoke, and thou (Agni)\nsittest down with the gods.\n\nVI, 11, 2. pavakaya _g_ uhva\xcc\x83 vahni _h_ asa\xc2\xb4.\n\nThou, a poet with a bright tongue, O Agni!\n\nGrassmann thinks that vahnir asa can always be translated by 'vor das\nAngesicht bringend,' but this does not appear to be the case in his\ntranslation.\n\nThe question now arises in what sense vahni is used when applied without\nfurther definition to certain deities. Most deities in the Veda are\nrepresented as driving or driven, and many as poets or priests. When the A _s_\nvins are called vahni, VIII, 8, 12; VII, 73, 4, it may mean riders. But when\nthe Vi _s_ ve Devas are so called, I, 3, 9, or the _Ri_ bhus, the exact\nmeaning is more doubtful. The Maruts are certainly riders, and whatever other\nscholars may say to the contrary, it can be proved that they were supposed to\nsit astride on horseback, and to have the bridle through the horse's nostrils\n(V, 61, 2). But if in our verse I, 6, 5, we translate vahni as an epithet,\nrider, and not only as an epithet, but as a name of the Maruts, we cannot\nsupport our translation by independent evidence, but must rely partly on the\nauthority of Saya _n_ a, partly on the general tenor of the text before us,\nwhere the Maruts are mentioned in the preceding verse, and, if I am right, in\nthe verse following also. On the other hand, if vahni can thus be used as a\nname of\n\np. 44\n\nthe Maruts, there is at least one other passage which would gain in clearness\nby the admission of that meaning, viz.\n\nX, 138, 1. tava tye indra sakhyeshu vahnaya _h_ --vi adardiru _h_ valam.\n\nIn thy friendship, Indra, these Maruts tore asunder the cloud.\n\nNote 2. I have translated vi _l_ u by stronghold, though it is only an\nadjective, meaning firm. Dr. Oscar Meyer, in his able essay Quaestiones\nHomericae, specimen prius, Bonnae, 1867, has tried to show that this vi _l_ u\nis the original form of \xe1\xbc\xbc\xce\xbb\xce\xb9\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, and he has brought some further evidence to\nshow that the siege and conquest of Troy, as I pointed out in my Lectures on\nthe Science of Language, vol. ii, p. 470, was originally described in language\nborrowed from the siege and conquest of the dark night by the powers of light,\nor from the destruction of the cloud by the weapons of Indra. It ought to be\nconsidered, however, that vi _l_ u in the Veda has not dwindled down as yet to\na mere name, and that therefore it may have originally retained its purely\nappellative power in Greek as well as in Sanskrit, and from meaning a\nstronghold in general, have come to mean the stronghold of Troy.\n\nNote 3. The bright cows are here the cows of the morning, the dawns, or the\ndays themselves, which are represented as rescued at the end of each night by\nthe power of Indra, or similar solar gods. Indra's companions in that daily\nrescue are here the Maruts, the storms, the same companions who act even a\nmore prominent part in the battle of Indra against the dark clouds. These two\nbattles are often mixed up together, so that possibly usriya _h_ may have been\nmeant for clouds.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nWilson: The reciters of praises praise the mighty (troop of Maruts), who are\ncelebrated, and conscious of the power of bestowing wealth in like manner as\nthey (glorify) the counsellor (Indra).\n\nBenfey: Nach ihrer Einsicht verherrlichend besingen Sanger den Schatzeherrn,\nden beruhmten, gewaltigen.\n\np. 45\n\nLudwig: Als fromme heran zum liede haben die sanger ihn, der trefliches\nfindet, beruhmten gesungen.\n\nNote 1. The reasons why I take gira _h_ as a masculine in the sense of singer\nor praiser, may be seen in a note to I, 37, 10.\n\nNote 2. yatha matim, lit. according to their mind, according to their heart's\ndesire. Cf. II, 24, 13.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nWilson: May you be seen, Maruts, accompanied by the undaunted (Indra); both\nrejoicing, and of equal splendour.\n\nBenfey: So lass mit Indra denn vereint, dem furchtlosen, erblicken dich, beide\nerfreu'nd und glanzesgleich.\n\nLudwig: Mit Indra zusammen wirst du gesehn zusammengehend mit dem furchtlosen,\nmild ihr zwei, von gleichem glanze.\n\nNote 1. The sudden transition from the plural to the singular is strange, but\nthe host of the Maruts is frequently spoken of in the singular, and nothing\nelse can here be intended. It may be true, as Professor Benfey suggests, that\nthe verses here put together stood originally in a different order, or that\nthey were taken from different sources. Yet though the Sama-veda would seem to\nsanction a small alteration in the order of the verses, the alteration of\nverses 7, 4, 5, as following each other, would not help us much. The Atharva-\nveda sanctions no change in the order of these verses.\n\nThe transition to the dual at the end of the verse is likewise abrupt, not\nmore so, however, than we are prepared for in the Veda. The suggestion of the\nNirukta (IV, 12) that these duals might be taken as instrumentals of the\nsingular, is of no real value.\n\nNote 2. D _r i_kshase, a very valuable form, well explained by d _ri_ _s_\nyetha _h_ , a second person singular conjunctive of the First Aorist\n\xc3\x82tmanepada, the termination 'sase' corresponding to Greek \xcf\x83\xe1\xbf\x83, as the\nconjunctive takes the personal terminations of the present in both languages.\nSimilar\n\np. 46\n\nforms, viz. p _ri_ kshase, X, 22, 7, ma _m_ sase, X, 27, 10; Ath. Veda VII,\n20, 2-6, and possibly vivakshase, X, 21, 1-8, 24, 1-3, 25, 1-11, will have to\nbe considered hereafter. (Nirukta, ed. Roth, p. 30, Notes.) As Ludwig has\npointed out, the Ta _n_ _d_ ya-brahma _n_ a XII, 2, 6, 7, reads d _ri_ kshuse,\nand explains it by ime loka dad _ri_ _s_ ire. Saya _n_ a, however, explains d\n_ri_ _s_ idhato _h_ karma _n_ i madhyamaikava _k_ ane vyatyayena sepratyaye d\n_ri_ kshusa iti rupam. See Delbruck, Syntaktische Forschungen, I, p. 111. The\nstory of Indra's being forsaken by all the gods in his battle against V _ri_\ntra, but being helped by the Maruts, is often mentioned; see RV. VIII, 96, 7;\nSV. I, 4, 1, 4, 2; Ait. Br. III, 20.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nWilson: This rite is performed in adoration of the powerful Indra, along with\nthe irreproachable, heavenward-tending, and amiable bands (of the Maruts).\n\nBenfey: Durch Indra's liebe Schaaren, die untadligen, himmelsturmenden,\nstrahlet das Opfer machtiglich.\n\nLudwig: Mit den tadellosen, morgens erscheinenden singt der kampfer sighaft,\nmit des Indra zu liebenden scharen.\n\nNote 1. Ar _k_ ati, which I have here translated by he cries aloud, means\nliterally, he celebrates. I do not know of any passage where ar _k_ ati, when\nused, as here, without an object, means to shine, as Professor Benfey\ntranslates it. The real difficulty, however, lies in makha, which Saya _n_ a\nexplains by sacrifice, and which I have ventured to translate by priest or\nsacrificer. Makha, as an adjective, means, as far as we can judge, strong or\nvigorous, and is applied to various deities, such as Pushan I, 138, 1, Savit\n_ri_ VI, 71, 1, Soma XI, 20, 7, Indra III, 34, 2, the Maruts I, 64, 11; VI,\n66, 9. By itself, makha is never used as the name of any deity, and it cannot\ntherefore, as Professor Roth proposes, be used in our passage as a name of\nIndra, or be referred to Indra as a significant adjective. In I, 119, 3, makha\nis applied to men or warriors, but it does not follow that makha by itself\nmeans warriors, though it maybe connected\n\np. 47\n\nwith the Greek \xce\xbc\xce\xb1\xcf\x87\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 in \xcf\x83\xe1\xbd\xbb\xce\xbc\xce\xbc\xce\xb1\xcf\x87\xce\xbf\xcf\x82. See Curtius, Grundzuge, p. 293; Grassmann,\nin Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xvi, p. 164.\n\nThere are two passages where makha refers to an enemy of the gods, IX, 101,\n13; X, 171, 2.\n\nAmong the remaining passages there is one where makha is used in parallelism\nwith vahni, X, 11, 6. vivakti vahni _h_ , su-apasyate makha _h_. Here I\npropose to translate, The poet speaks out, the priest works well. The same\nmeaning seems applicable likewise to the phrase makhasya davane, to the\noffering of the priest, though I should prefer to translate 'to share in the\nsacrifice.'\n\nI, 134, 1. a\xc2\xb4 yahi davane, va\xc2\xb4yo (iti), makhasya davane.\n\nCome, Vayu, to the offering, to the offering of the priest.\n\nVIII, 7, 27. a\xc2\xb4 na _h_ makhasya davane--devasa _h_ upa gantana.\n\nCome, gods, to the offering of our priest.\n\nProfessor Roth proposes to render makha in these passages by 'attestation of\njoy, celebration, praise,' and he takes davane as a dative of davan, a nomen\nactionis, meaning, the giving. There are some passages where one feels\ninclined to admit a noun davana, and to take davane as a locative sing.\n\nVI, 71, 2. devasya vayam savitu _h_ savimani  \n            _s_ resh _th_ e syama vasuna _h_ _k_ a davane.\n\nMay we be in the favour of the god Savitar, and in the best award of his\ntreasure.\n\nIn II, 11, 1, and II, 11, 12, the locative would likewise be preferable; but\nthere is a decided majority of passages in which davane occurs and where it is\nto be taken as a dative a, nor is there any other instance in the Veda of a\nnomen actionis being formed by vana. It is better, therefore, in VI, 71, 2, to\nrefer _s_ resh _th_ e to savimani, and to make allowance in the other passages\nfor the idiomatic use of such phrases as davane vasunam or raya _h_ davane,\nwhether from da or from do. See De Infinitivi forma et usu, by E. Wilhelm,\n1873, p. 17.\n\np. 48\n\nThe termination vane explains, as has been shown by Professor Benfey, Greek\ninfinitives such as \xce\xb4\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xb9, i. e. \xce\xb4\xce\xbf\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xb9 or \xce\xb4\xce\xbf\xcf\x9d\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xb9 = Sanskrit da-vane. The\ntermination mane in da\xc2\xb4-mane, for the purpose of giving, explains, as the same\nscholar has proved, the ancient infinitives in Greek, such as \xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb9-\xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xb9. It may\nbe added that the regular infinitives in Greek, ending in \xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xb9, as \xce\xbb\xce\xb5\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xcf\x80-\n\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xb9, are likewise matched by Vedic forms such as IX, 61, 30. dhu\xc2\xb4rv-ane, or\nVI, 61, 13. vibhv-ane, and turv-ane (Delbruck in K. Z. XVIII, p. 82; Bopp,\nAccent, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7106, 113, 117). It is hardly right to say that vibhvane in VI, 61,\n13, should be taken as an instrumental, for it does not refer to the chariot,\nbut to Sarasvati. In the termination \xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xce\xbd, which stands for \xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xb9, like \xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xcf\x82 for\n\xce\xb5\xcf\x83\xce\xb9, we have, on the contrary, not a dative, but a locative of an abstract\nnoun in an, both cases, as we see from their juxta-position in VI, 71, 2,\nbeing equally applicable to express the relation which we are accustomed to\ncall infinitive. See RV. I, 134, 5. ugra\xc2\xb4 _h_ isha _n_ anta bhurva _n_ i,\napa\xc2\xb4m ishanta bhurva _n_ i.\n\nNote 2. Abhidyu I now translate by hastening, and derive it from div, divyati,\nin its original meaning of to throw forth, to break forth, to shine. As from\nthis root we have didyu, weapon, what is thrown, pl. didyava _h_ , and\npossibly didyut, the weapon, particularly Indra's weapon or thunderbolt,\nabhidyu might mean breaking forth, rushing forth towards us, something like\nprakri _l_ ina _h_ , another name of the Maruts. How abhidyu could mean\nconquerant, maitre du jour, as M. Bergaigne maintains, I do not see.\nAbhidyu\xc2\xb4n, I, 33, I I; 190, 4, does not differ much from anudyu\xc2\xb4n, i. e. it is\nused vipsayam.\n\n##### Verses 9, 10.\n\nWilson: Therefore circumambient (troop of Maruts), come hither, whether from\nthe region of the sky, or from the solar sphere; for, in this rite, (the\npriest) fully recites your praises.\n\nBenfey: Von hier, oder vom Himmel komm ob dem \xc3\x86ther, Umkreisender! zu dir\nstreben die Lieder all.\n\np. 49\n\nLudwig: Von hieher, o Pari _g_ man, kom, oder von des himels glanzfirmamente\nher; zu disem streben unsere lieder auf.\n\nWilson: We invoke Indra,--whether he come from this earthly region, or from\nthe heaven above, or from the vast firmament,--that he may give (us) wealth.\n\nBenfey: Von hier, oder vom Himmel ob der Erde begehren Spende wir, oder,\nIndra! aus weiter Luft.\n\nLudwig: Von hier zu empfangen verlangen wir, oder vom himel, oder vom\nirdischen raume her, oder aus dem grossen luftkreis den Indra.\n\nNote 1. Although the names for earth, sky, and heaven vary in different parts\nof the Veda, yet the expression diva _h_ ro _k_ anam occurs so frequently that\nwe can hardly take it in this place in a sense different from its ordinary\nmeaning. Professor Benfey thinks that ro _k_ ana may here mean ether, and he\ntranslates 'come from heaven above the ether;' and in the next verse, 'come\nfrom heaven above the earth.' At first, every reader would feel inclined to\ntake the two phrases, diva _h_ va ro _k_ ana\xc2\xb4t adhi, and diva _h_ va\npa\xc2\xb4rthivat adhi, as parallel; yet I believe they are not quite so.\n\nThe following passages will show that the two words ro _k_ anam diva _h_\nbelong together, and that they signify the light of heaven, or the bright\nplace of heaven.\n\nVIII, 98, 3. aga _k_ _kh_ a _h_ ro _k_ anam diva _h_.\n\nThou (Indra) wentest to the light of heaven. I, 155, 3.\n\nIII, 6, 8. urau va ye antarikshe--diva _h_ va ye ro _k_ ane.\n\nIn the wide sky, or in the light of heaven.\n\nVIII, 82, 4. upame ro _k_ ane diva _h_.\n\nIn the highest light of heaven.\n\nIX, 86, 27. t _ri_ ti\xc2\xb4ye p _ri_ sh _th_ e adhi ro _k_ ane diva _h_.\n\nOn the third ridge, in the light of heaven. See also I, 105, 5; VIII, 69, 3.\n\nThe very phrase which we find in our verse, only with _k_ it instead of va,\noccurs again, I, 49, I; VIII, 8, 7; and the same sense must probably be\nassigned to VIII, 1, 18, adha _g_ ma _h_ adha va diva _h_ b _ri_ hata _h_ ro\n_k_ ana\xc2\xb4t adhi.\n\np. 50\n\nEither from the earth, or from the light of the great heaven, increase, O\nIndra!\n\nRo _k_ ana also occurs in the plural:\n\nI, 146, 1. vi _s_ va diva _h_ ro _k_ ana\xc2\xb4.\n\nAll the bright regions of heaven.\n\nSaya _n_ a: 'All the bright palaces of the gods.' See III, 12, 9.\n\nThe same word ro _k_ ana, and in the same sense, is sometimes joined with\nsu\xc2\xb4rya and na\xc2\xb4ka.\n\nThus, I, 14, 9. su\xc2\xb4ryasya ro _k_ ana\xc2\xb4t vi _s_ van deva\xc2\xb4n--hota iha vakshati.\n\nMay the Hotar bring the Vi _s_ ve Devas hither from the light of the sun, or\nfrom the bright realm of the sun.\n\nIII, 22, 3. ya\xc2\xb4 _h_ ro _k_ ane parastat su\xc2\xb4ryasya.\n\nThe waters which are above, in the bright realm of the sun, and those which\nare below.\n\nI, 19, 6. ye na\xc2\xb4kasya adhi ro _k_ ane, divi deva\xc2\xb4sa _h_ a\xc2\xb4sate.\n\nThey who in the light of the firmament, in heaven, are enthroned as gods.\n\nHere divi, in heaven, seems to be the same as the light of the firmament,\nna\xc2\xb4kasya ro _k_ ane.\n\nThus ro _k_ ana occurs also frequently by itself, when it clearly has the\nmeaning of heaven.\n\nIt is said of the dawn, I, 49, 4; of the sun, I, 50, 4; and of Indra, III, 44,\n4.\n\nvi _s_ vam a\xc2\xb4 bhati ro _k_ anam, he lights up the whole sky.\n\nWe also read of three ro _k_ anas, where, though it is difficult to say what\nis really meant, we must translate, the three skies. The cosmography of the\nVeda is, as I said before, somewhat vague and varying. There is, of course,\nthe natural division of the world into heaven and earth (dyu and bhu\xc2\xb4mi), and\nthe threefold division into earth, sky, and heaven, where sky is meant for the\nregion intermediate between heaven and earth (p _ri_ thivi\xc2\xb4, antariksha, dyu).\nThere is also a fourfold division, for instance,\n\nVIII, 97, 5.\n\nyat va asi ro _k_ ane diva _h_  \nsamudrasya adhi vish _t_ api,  \nyat pa\xc2\xb4rthive sadane v _ri_ trahan-tama,  \nyat antarikshe a\xc2\xb4 gahi.\n\np. 51\n\nWhether thou, O greatest killer of V _ri_ tra, art in the light of heaven, or\nin the basin of the sea, or in the place of the earth, or in the sky, come\nhither!\n\nV, 52, 7. ye vav _ri_ dhanta pa\xc2\xb4rthiva _h_ ye urau antarikshe a\xc2\xb4, vri _g_ ane\nva nadi\xc2\xb4nam sadha-sthe va maha _h_ diva _h_.\n\nThe Maruts who grew, being on the earth, those who are in the wide sky, or in\nthe realm of the rivers, or in the abode of the great heaven.\n\nBut very soon these three or more regions are each spoken of as threefold.\nThus,\n\nI, 102, 8. tisra _h_ bhu\xc2\xb4mi _h_ tri\xc2\xb4 _n_ i ro _k_ ana\xc2\xb4.\n\nThe three earths, the three skies.\n\nII, 27, 9. tri\xc2\xb4 ro _k_ ana\xc2\xb4 divya\xc2\xb4 dharayanta.\n\nThe \xc3\x82dityas support the three heavenly skies.\n\nV, 69, 1. tri\xc2\xb4 ro _k_ ana\xc2\xb4 varu _n_ a tri\xc2\xb4n uta dyu\xc2\xb4n tri\xc2\xb4 _n_ i mitra\ndharayatha _h_ ra _g_ a _m_ si.\n\nMitra and Varu _n_ a, you support the three lights, and the three heavens, and\nthe three skies.\n\nHere there seems some confusion, which Saya _n_ a's commentary makes even\nworse confounded. What can ro _k_ ana\xc2\xb4 mean as distinct from dyu and ra _g_\nas? The fourth verse of the same hymn throws no light on the subject, and I\nshould feel inclined to take divya\xc2\xb4-pa\xc2\xb4rthivasya as one word, though even then\nthe cosmic division here adopted is by no means clear. However, there is a\nstill more complicated division alluded to in IV, 53, 5:\n\ntri _h_ antariksham savita\xc2\xb4 mahi-tvana\xc2\xb4 tri\xc2\xb4 ra _g_ a _m_ si pari-bhu _h_ tri\xc2\xb4\n_n_ i ro _k_ ana\xc2\xb4, tisra _h_ diva _h_ p _ri_ thivi\xc2\xb4 _h_ tisra _h_ invati.\n\nHere we have the sky thrice, three welkins, three lights, three heavens, three\nearths.\n\nA careful consideration of all these passages will show, I think, that in our\npassage we must take diva _h_ va ro _k_ ana\xc2\xb4t adhi in its usual sense, and\nthat we cannot separate the two words.\n\nIn the next verse, on the contrary, it seems equally clear that diva _h_ and\npa\xc2\xb4rthivat must be separated. At all events there is no passage in the Rig-\nveda where pa\xc2\xb4rthiva is joined as an adjective with dyu. Pa\xc2\xb4rthiva as an\nadjective is frequently joined with ra _g_ as, never with dyu. See I, 81,\n\np. 52\n\n[paragraph continues] 5; 99, 7; VIII, 88, 5; IX, 72, 8: in the plural, I, 154,\n1; V, 81, 3; VI, 31, 2; 49, 3.\n\nPa\xc2\xb4rthivani also occurs by itself, when it refers to the earth. as opposed to\nthe sky and heaven.\n\nX, 32, 2. vi indra yasi divya\xc2\xb4ni ro _k_ ana\xc2\xb4 vi pa\xc2\xb4rthivani ra _g_ asa.\n\nIndra thou goest in the sky between the heavenly lights and the earthly.\n\nVIII, 94, 9. a\xc2\xb4 ye vi _s_ va pa\xc2\xb4rthivani paprathan ro _k_ ana\xc2\xb4 diva _h_.\n\nThe Maruts who stretched out all the earthly lights, and the lights of heaven.\n\nVI, 61, 11. a-paprushi pa\xc2\xb4rthivani uru ra _g_ a _h_ antariksham.\n\nSarasvati filling the earthly places, the wide welkin, the sky. This is a\ndoubtful passage.\n\nLastly, pa\xc2\xb4rthivani by itself seems to signify earth, sky, and heaven, if\nthose are the three regions which Vish _n_ u measured with his three steps; or\neast, the zenith, and west, if these were intended as the three steps of that\ndeity. For we read:\n\nI, 155, 4. ya _h_ pa\xc2\xb4rthivani tri-bhi _h_ it vigama-bhi _h_ uru kramish _t_ a.\n\nHe (Vish _n_ u) who strode wide with his three strides across the regions of\nthe earth.\n\nThese two concluding verses might also be taken as containing the actual\ninvocation of the sacrificer, which is mentioned in verse 8. In that case the\nfull stop at the end of verse 8 should be removed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[20:a](sbe3216.htm#fr_88) Chips from a German Workshop, 2nd ed., vol. ii, p.\n137 seq.

Though I agree with Curtius in admitting\na primitive root as, to breathe, from which as-u, breath, must have sprung, I\nhave always hesitated about the derivation of as and asya, mouth, from the\nsame root. I do not think, however, that the lengthening of the vowel in as is\nso great a difficulty as has been supposed (Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. xvii, p.\n145). Several roots lengthen their vowel a, when used as substantives without\nderivative suffixes. In some cases this lengthening is restricted to the A\xe1\xb9\x85ga\nbase, as in ana _d_ vah; in others to the A\xe1\xb9\x85ga and Pada base, as in vi _s_\nvava _t_ , vi _s_ vava _d_ bhi _h_ , &c.; in others again it pervades the\nwhole declension, as in turasha _t_ : (see Sanskrit Grammar, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 210, 208,\n175.) Among ordinary words va _k_ offers a clear instance of a lengthened\nvowel. In the Veda we find _ri_ tishaham, VI, 14, 4, and _ri_ tisha\xc2\xb4ham (Sa\n_m_ hita), I, 64, 15. In X, 71, 10 the Sa _m_ hita has sabhasahena, the Pada\nsabhasahena. We find vah in apsu-vah (Sam. Ved.), indra-vah, havya-vah. Sah at\nthe end of compounds, such as n _ri_ -sah, p _ri_ tana-sah, bhuri-sah, satra-\nsah, vibha-sah, sada-sah, varies between a long and short a: (see Regnier,\n\xc3\x89tude sur l'idiome du p. 43 Vedas, p. 111.) At all events no instance has yet\nbeen pointed out in Sanskrit, showing the same contraction which we should\nhave to admit if, as has been proposed, we derived as from av-as, or from an-\nas. From 'an' we have in the Veda ana, mouth or face, I, 52, 15. From as, to\nbreathe, the Latin omen, originally os-men, a whisper, might likewise be\nderived. See Bopp, Comp. Gr. par. 909; Kuhn in Ind.
