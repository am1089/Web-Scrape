And on account of (the impossibility of) activity.\n\nLeaving the arrangement of the world, we now pass on to the activity by which\nit is produced.--The three gu _n_ as, passing out of the state of equipoise\nand entering into the condition of mutual subordination and superordination,\noriginate activities tending towards the production of particular effects.--\nNow these activities also cannot be ascribed to a non-intelligent pradhana\nleft to itself, as no such activity is seen in clay and similar substances, or\nin chariots and the like. For we observe that clay and the like, and chariots\n--which are in their own nature non-intelligent--enter on activities tending\ntowards particular effects only when they are acted upon by intelligent beings\nsuch as potters, &c. in the one case, and horses and the like in the other\ncase. From what is seen we determine what is not seen. Hence a non-intelligent\ncause of the world is not to be inferred because, on that hypothesis, the\nactivity without which the world cannot be produced would be impossible.\n\nBut, the Sa _n_ khya rejoins, we do likewise not observe activity on the part\nof mere intelligent beings.--True; we however see activity on the part of non-\nintelligent things such as chariots and the like when they are in conjunction\nwith intelligent beings.--But, the Sa _n_ khya again objects, we never\nactually observe activity on the part of an intelligent\n\np. 368\n\nbeing even when in conjunction with a non-intelligent thing.--Very well; the\nquestion then arises: Does the activity belong to that in which it is actually\nobserved (as the Sa _n_ khya says), or to that on account of the conjunction\nwith which it is observed (as the Vedantin avers)?--We must, the Sa _n_ khya\nreplies, attribute activity to that in which it is actually seen, since both\n(i.e. the activity and its abode) are matter of observation. A mere\nintelligent being, on the other hand, is never observed as the abode of\nactivity while a chariot is. The 1 existence of an intelligent Self joined to\na body and so on which are the abode of activity can be established (by\ninference) only; the inference being based on the difference observed between\nliving bodies and mere non-intelligent things, such as chariots and the like.\nFor this very reason, viz. that intelligence is observed only where a body is\nobserved while it is never seen without a body, the Materialists consider\nintelligence to be a mere attribute of the body.--Hence activity belongs only\nto what is non-intelligent.\n\nTo all this we--the Vedantins--make the following reply.--We do not mean to\nsay that activity does not belong to those non-intelligent things in which it\nis observed; it does indeed belong to them; but it results from an intelligent\nprinciple, because it exists when the latter is present and does not exist\nwhen the latter is absent. Just as the effects of burning and shining, which\nhave their abode in wood and similar material, are indeed not observed when\nthere is mere fire (i.e. are not due to mere fire; as mere fire, i.e. fire\nwithout wood, &c., does not exist), but at the same time result from fire only\nas they are seen when fire is present and are not seen when fire is absent;\nso, as the Materialists also admit, only intelligent bodies are observed\n\np. 369\n\nto be the movers of chariots and other non-intelligent things. The motive\npower of intelligence is therefore incontrovertible.--But--an objection will\nbe raised--your Self even if joined to a body is incapable of exercising\nmoving power, for motion cannot be effected by that the nature of which is\npure intelligence.--A thing, we reply, which is itself devoid of motion may\nnevertheless move other things. The magnet is itself devoid of motion, and yet\nit moves iron; and colours and the other objects of sense, although themselves\ndevoid of motion, produce movements in the eyes and the other organs of sense.\nSo the Lord also who is all-present, the Self of all, all-knowing and all-\npowerful may, although himself unmoving, move the universe.--If it finally be\nobjected that (on the Vedanta doctrine) there is no room for a moving power as\nin consequence of the oneness (aduality) of Brahman no motion can take place;\nwe reply that such objections have repeatedly been refuted by our pointing to\nthe fact of the Lord being fictitiously connected with Maya, which consists of\nname and form presented by Nescience.--Hence motion can be reconciled with the\ndoctrine of an all-knowing first cause; but not with the doctrine of a non-\nintelligent first cause.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[368:1](sbe34178.htm#fr_328) The next sentences furnish the answer to the\nquestion how the intelligent Self is known at all if it is not the object of\nperception.--Pratyakshatvabhave katham atmasiddhir ity asa _n_ kya anumanad\nity aha, prav _ri_ ttiti. Anumanasiddhasya _k_ etanasya na pravr _i_ ttya _s_\nrayateti dar _s_ ayitum evakara _h_. Katham anumanam ity apekshaya _m_\ntatprakara _m_ ; su _k_ ayati kevaleti.
