Then the son of Vibhanduka, of subdued\npassions, seeking the happiness of the king, proceeded to perform the\nsacrifice for the accomplishment of his wishes. Hither were previously\ncollected the gods, with the Gandharvas, the Siddhas and the sages, for the\nsake of receiving their respective shares, Brahma too, the sovereign of the\ngods, with Sthanoo, and Narayana, chief of beings and the four supporters of\nthe universe, and the divine,mothers of all the celestials, met together\nthere. To the Ushwa-medha, the great sacrifice of the magnanimous monarch,\ncame also Indra the glorious one, surrounded by the Muroots. Rishya-shringi\nthen supplicated the gods assembled for their share of the sacrifice (saying),\n"This devout king Dusha-rutha, who, through the desire of offspring, confiding\nin you, has performed sacred austerities, and who has offered to you the\nsacrifice called Ushwa-medha, is about to perform, another sacrifice for the\nsake of obtaining sons. To him thus desirous of offspring be pleased to grant\nthe blessing: I supplicate you all with joined hands. May he have four sons,\nrenowned through the universe." The gods replied to the sage\'s son\nsupplicating with joined hands, "Be it so: thou, O brahman, art ever to be\nregarded by us, as the king is in a peculiar manner. The lord of men by this\nsacrifice shall obtain the great object of his desires. Having thus said, the\ngods preceded by Indra, disappeared.\n\nThey all then having seen that (sacrifice) performed by the great sage\naccording to the ordinance went to Prajapati the lord of mankind, and with\njoined hands addressed Brahma the giver of blessings, "O Brhama, the Rakshas\nRavana by name, to whom a blessing was awarded by thee, through pride\ntroubleth all of us the gods, and even the great sages, who perpetually\npractise sacred austerities. We, O glorious one, regarding the promise\nformerly granted by thy kindness that he should be invulnerable to the gods,\nthe Danuvas and the Yukshas have born (sic) all, (his oppression); this lord\nof Rakshases therefore distresses the universe; and, inflated by this promise\nunjustly vexes the divine sages, the Yukshas, and Gandhavras, the Usooras, and\nmen: where Ravana remains there the sun loses his force, the winds through\nfear of him do not blow, the fire ceases to burn; the rolling ocean, seeing\nhim, ceases to move its waves. Vishruvna, distressed by his power, has\nabandoned Lanka and fled. O divine one save us from Ravana, who fills the\nworld with noise and tumult. O giver of desired things, be pleased to contrive\na way for his destruction."\n\nBruhma thus informed by the devas, reflecting, replied, Oh! I have devised the\nmethod for slaying this outrageous tyrant. Upon his requesting, "May I be\ninvulnerable to the divine sages, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Rakshasas\n\np. 510\n\nand the serpents," I replied "Be it so."This Raksh _u_ s, through contempt,\nsaid nothing respecting man; therefore this wicked one shall be destroyed by\nman. The gods, preceded by Sh _u_ kr _a_ , hearing these words spoken by Br\n_u_ hm _a_ , were filled with joy.\n\nAt this time V _i_ shn _oo_ the glorious, the lord of the world, arrayed in\nyellow, with hand ornaments of glowing gold, riding on Vin _u_ tey _a_ , as\nthe sun on a cloud, arrived with his conch, his discus, and his club in his\nhand. Being adored by the excellent celestials, and welcomed by Br _u_ hm _a_\n, he drew near and stood before him. All the gods then addressed V _i_ shn\n_oo_ , "O M _u_ dh _oo_ -s _oo_ d _u_ na, thou art able to abolish the\ndistress of the distressed. We intreat thee, be our sanctuary, 0 _U_ chy _oo_\nta." Vishn _oo_ replied, "Say, what shall I do?" The celestials hearing these\nhis words added further. "The virtuous, the encourager of excellence, eminent\nfor truth, the firm observer of his vows, being childless, is performing an\n_U_ shwamedh _a_ for the purpose of obtaining offspring. For the sake of the\ngood of the universe, we intreat thee, O V _i_ shn _oo_ , to become his son.\nDividing thyself into four parts, in the wombs of his three consorts equal to\nH _u_ r _i_ , Shree, and Keertee, assume the sonship of king D _u_ sha-r _u_\nth _a_ , the lord of _U_ yodhya, eminent in the knowledge of duty, generous\nand illustrious, as the great sages. Thus becoming man, O Vishn _oo_ , conquer\nin battle Rav _u_ n _a_ , the terror of the universe, who is invulnerable to\nthe gods. This ignorant Raksh _u_ s Rav _u_ n _a_ , by the exertion of his\npower, afflicts the gods, the G _u_ ndhurv _a_ s, the S _i_ ddh _a_ s, and the\nmost excellent sages; these sages, the G _u_ ndh _u_ rv _a_ s, and the _U_ ps\n_a_ r _a_ s, sporting in the forest N _u_ nd _u_ n _a_ have been destroyed by\nthat furious one. We, with the sages, are come to thee seeking his\ndestruction. The S _i_ ddh _a_ s, the G _u_ ndh _u_ rv _a_ s, and the Y _a_\nksh _a_ s betake themselves to thee, thou art our only refuge; O Dev _a_ ,\nafflicter of enemies, regard the world of men, and destroy the enemy of the\ngods."\n\nVishn _oo_ , the sovereign of the gods, the chief of the celestials, adored by\nall beings, being thus supplicated, replied to all the assembled gods\n(standing) before Br _u_ hm _a_ , "Abandon fear; peace be with you; for your\nbenefit having killed Rav _u_ n _a_ the cruel, destructively active, the cause\nof fear to the divine sages, together with all his posterity, his courtiers\nand counsellors, and his relations, and friends, protecting the earth, I will\nremain incarnate among men for the space of eleven thousand years."\n\nHaving given this promise to the gods, the divine Vishn _oo_ , ardent in the\nwork, sought a birth-place among men. Dividing himself into four parts, he\nwhose eyes resemble the lotos and the p _u_ las _a_ , the lotos petal-eyed,\nchose for his father D _u_ sha-r _a_ th _a_ the sovereign of men. The divine\nsages then with the G _u_ ndh _u_ rv _a_ s, the R _oo_ dr _a_ s, and the\n(different sorts of) _U_ psar _a_ s, in the most excellent strains, praised\nthe destroyer of M _u_ dh _oo_ , (saying) "Root up Rav _u_ n _a_ , of fervid\nenergy, the devastator, the enemy of _I_ ndra swollen with pride. Destroy him,\nwho causes universal lamentation, the annoyer of the holy ascetics, terrible,\nthe terror of the devout T _u_ p _u_ swees. Having destroyed Rav _u_ n _a_ ,\ntremendously powerful, who causes universal weeping, together with his army\nand friends, dismissing all sorrow, return to heaven, the place free from\nstain and sin, and protected by the sovereign of the celestial powers."\n\nThus far the Section, containing the plan for the death of Rav _u_ n _a_.\n\n                                            CAREY AND MARSHMAN. \n\np. 511\n\nCAPUT XIV.\n\nRATIO NECANDI RAVANAE EXCOGITATA.\n\nPrudens ille, voluminum sacrorum gnarus, responsum quod dederat aliquamdiu\nmeditatus, mente ad se revocata regem deuno est effatus: Parabo tibi aliud\nsacrum, genitale, prolis masculae adipiscendae gratia, cum carminibus in\nATHARVANIS exordio expressis rite peragendum. Tum coepit modestus Vibhandaci\nfilius, regis commodis intentus, parare sacrum, quo eius desiderium expleret.\nLam\'antea* eo convenerant, ut suam quisque portionem acciperent, Di cum\nfidicinum coelestium choris, Beatique cum Sapientibus; Brachman Superum\nregnator, Sthanus nee non augustus Narayanus, Indrasque alraus, coram visendus\nVentorum cohorte circumdatus, in magno isto sacrificio equino regis magnanimi.\nIbidem vates ille deos, qui portiones suas accipiendi gratia advenerant,\napprecatus, En!* inquit, hicce--ex Dasarathus filiorum desiderio castimoniis\nadstrictus, fidei plenus, vestrum numen adoravit sacrificio equino. Nunc\niterum accingit se ad aliud sacrum peragendum: quamobrem aequum est, ut filios\ncupienti vos faveatis. Ille ego, qui manus supplices tendo, vos universos pro\neo apprecor: nascantur ei filii quatuor, faina per triplicem mundum clari.\nDivi supplicem vatis filium invicem affari: Fiat quod petis! Tu nobis,\nvirsancte, imprimis es venerandus, nec minus rex ille; compos fiet voti sui\negregii hominum princeps. Ita locuti Di Indra duce, ex oculis evanuerunt.\n\nSuperi vero, legitime in concilio congregati. BRACHMANEM mundi creatorem his\nverbis compellarunt: Tuo munere auctus, O Brachman! gigas nomine Ravanas, prae\nsuperbia nos omnes vexat, pariterque Sapientes castimoniis gaudentes. A te\npropitio olim ex voto ei hoc munus concessum fuit, ut ne a diis, Danuidis,\nGeniisve necari posset. Nos, oraculum tuum reveriti, facinora eius\nqualiacunque toleramus. At ille gigantum tyrannus ternos mundos gravibus\niniuriis vexat Deos, Sapientes, Genios, Fidicines coelestes, Titanes, mortales\ndenique, exsuperat ille aegre cohibendus, tuoque munere demens. Non ibi calet\nsol, neque Ventus prae timore spirat, nec flagrat ignis, ubi Ravanas versatur.\nIpse oceanus, vagis fluctibus redimitus, isto viso stat immotus; eiectus fuit\ne sede sua Cuverus, huius robore vexatus. Ergo ingens nobis periculum imminet\nab hoc gigante visu horribili; tuum est, alme Parens! auxilium parare, quo hic\ndeleatur. Ita admonitus ille a diis universis, paulisper meditatus, Ehem!*\ninquit, hancce inveni rationem nefarium istum necandi. Petierat is a me, ut a\nGandharvis, a Geniis, a Divis, Danuibus Gigantibusque necari non posset et me\nannuente voto suo potitus est. Prae contemptu vero monstrum illud homines non\ncommemoravit: ideo ab homine est necandus: nullum aliud exstat leti genus,\nquod ei sit \xc2\xa3atale. Postquam audiverant gratum hunc sermonem BRACHMANIS ore\nprolatum, Di cum duce suo Indra summopere gaudio erecti sunt. Eodem temporis\nmomento Vishnus, istuc accessit, splendore insignis, concham, discum et clavum\nmanibus gestans, croceo vestitu, mundi dominus, vulturis Vinateii dorso,\nsicuti sol nimbo, vectus, armillas ex auro candente gerens, salutatus a\nSuperum primoribus. Quem laudibus celebratum reverenter Di universi\ncompellarunt. Tu animantium afflictorum es vindex, Madhus interfector!\nquamobrem nos afflicti te apprecamur. Sis praesidio nobis numine tuo\ninconcusso. Dicite, inquit Vishnus, quid pro vobis facere\n\np. 512\n\nme oporteat. Audito eius sermone, Di hunc in modum respondent: Rex quidam,\nnomine Dasarathus, austeris castimoniis sese castigavit, litavit sacrificio\nequino, prolis cupidus et prole carens. Nostro hortatu tu, Vishnus,\nconditionem natorum eius subeas: ex tribus eius uxoribus, Pudicitiae,\nVenustatis et Famae similibus, nasci velis, temetipsum quadrifariam dividens.\nIbi tu in humanam naturam conversus Ravanam, gravissimam mundi pestem, diis\ninsuperabilem, O Vishnus! proelio caede. Gigas ille vecors Ravanas Deos cum\nFidicinum choris, Beatos et Sapientes praestantisslmos vexat, audacia\nsuperbiens. Etenim ab hoc furioso Sapientes Fidicines et nymphae, ludentes in\nNandano viridario, sunt proculcati. Tu es nostrum omnium summa salus, divine\nbellator! Ut deorum hostes extinguas, ad sortem humanam animum converte.\nAugustus ille Narayanus, diis hunc in modum coram hortantibus, eosdem apto hoc\nsermone compellavit: Quare, quaeso, hac in renegotium vestrum a me potissimum,\ncorporea specie palam facto, est peragendum *? *aut unde tantus vobis terror\nfuit iniectus? His verbis a Vishnu interrogati Di talia proferre: Terror nobis\ninstat, O Vishnus! a Ravana mundi direptore; a quo nos vindicare, corpore\nhumano assumpto, tuum est. Nemo alius coelicoiarum praeter te hunc scelestum\nenecare potis est. Nimirum ille, O hostium domitor! per diuturnum tempus sese\nexcruciaverat severissima abstinentia, qua magnus hicce rerum Parens propitius\nipsi redditus est, Itaque almus votorum sponsor olim ei concessit securitatem\nab ommibus animantibus. hominibus tamen exceptis. Hinc ilium, voti compotem,\nnon aliunde quam ab homine necis periculum urget: tu ergo, humanitate assumpta\neum intertice. Sic monitus Vishnus, Superum princeps, quem mundus univerans\nadorat, magnum Parentem oeterosque deos, in concilio congregatos, recti\nauctores, affatur: Mittite timorem; bene bobis eveniat! Vestrae salutis\ngratia, postquam praelio necavero Ravanam cum filiis nepotibusque, cum amicis,\nministris, cognatis socusque, crudelem istum aegre cohibendum, qui divinis\nSapientibus terrorem *incutit, per decem millia annorum decies centenis\nadditis, commorabor in mortalium sedibus, orbem terrarum imperio regens. Tum\ndivini sapientes et Fidicines conjuncti cum Rudris nympha, rumque choris\ncelebravere Madhus interfectorem hymnis, quales sedem aetheriam decent.\n\n"Ravanam ilium insolentem, acri impetu actum, superbia elatum, Superum hostem,\ntumultus cientem, bonorum piorumque pestem, humanitate assumpta pessumdare\ntuum est."\n\nSCHLEGEL.\n\nCAPITOLO XIV.\n\nIL MEZZO STABILITO PER UCCIDERE R\xc3\x81VANO.\n\nMa Riscyasringo soggiunse poscia al re: T\'apprestero io un altro rito\nsantissimo, genitale, onde tu conseguisca la prole che tu brami. E in quel\npunto stesso il saggio figliulo di Vibhandaco, iutento alia prosperita del re,\npose mano al sacro rito per condurre ad effetto il suo desiderio. Gia erano\nprima, per ricevere ciascuno la sua parte, qui convenuti al gran sacrifizio\ndel re magnanimo l\'Asvamedha, i Devi coi Gandharvi, i Siddhi e i Muni, Brahma\nSignor dei Sari, Sthanu e l\' Augusto Narayana, i quattio custudi dell\'\nuniverso e le Madri degli Iddn, i Yacsi insieme cogli Dei, e il sovrano,\nvenerando Indra, visibile, circondato\n\np. 513\n\ndalla schiera dei Maruti. Quivi cosi parlo Riscyasr\'ingo agli Dei venuti a\npartecipare del sacrifizio: Questo e il re Dasaratha, che per desiderio di\nprogenie gia s\' astrinse ad osservanze austere, e teste pieno di fede ha a\nvoi, O eccelsi, sacrificato con un Asvamedha. Ora egli, sollecito d\' aver\nfigli, si dispone ad adempiere un nuovo rito; vogliate essere favorevole a lui\nche sospira progenie. lo alzo a voi supplici le mani, e voi tutti per lui\nimplor\'o: nascano a lui quattro figli degni d\'essere celebrati per tre mondi.\nRisposero gli Dei al supplichevole tigliuolo del Risci: Sia fatto cio che\nchiedi; a te ed al re parimente si debbe da noi, O Brahmano, sommo pregio;\ncanseguira il re per questo sacro rito il suo suppremo desiderio. Cio detto\ndisparvero i Numi preceduti da Indra.\n\nPoiche videro gli Dei compiersi debitamente dal gran Risci l\'oblazione, venuti\nal cospetto di Brahma facitor del mondo, signor delle creature, cosi parlarono\nreverenti a lui dator di grazie: O Brahma, un Racsaso per nome Ravano, cui tu\nfosti largo del tuo favore, e per superbia infesto a noi tutti e ai grandi\nSaggi penitenti. Un di, O Nume, augusto, tu propizio a lui gli accordasti il\nfavore, ch\' egli bramava, di non poter essere ucciso dagli Dei, dai Danavi ne\ndai Yacsi: noi venerando i tuoi oracoli, ogni cosa sopportiamo da costui.\nQuindi il signor dei Racsasi infesta con perpetue offese i tre mondi, i Devi,\ni Risci, i Yacsi ed i Gandharvi, gli Asuri e gli uomini: tutti egli opprime\nindegnamente inorgoglito pel tuo dono. Cola dove si trova Ravano, piu non\nisfavilla per timore il sole, piu non spira il vento, piu non fiammeggia il\nfuoco: l\' oceano stesso cui fan corona i vasti flutti, veggendo costui, tutto\nsi turba e si commuove. Stretto dalla forza di costui e ridotto allo stremo\ndovette Vaisravano abbandonare Lanca. Da questo Ravano, terror del mondo, tu\nne proteggi, O almo Nume: degna, O dator d\'ogni bene, trovar modo ad estirpar\ncostui. Fatto di queste cose conscio dai Devi, stette alquanto meditando, poi\nrispose Brahma: Orsu! e stabilito il modo onde distruggere questo iniquo. Egli\na me chiese, ed io gliei concessi, di non poter essere ucciso dai Devi, dai\nRisci, dai Gandharvi, dai Yacsi, dai Racsasi ne dai Serpenti; ma per disprezzo\nnon fece menzione degli uomini quel Racso: or bene, sara quell\' empio ucciso\nda un uomo. Udite le fauste parole profferte da Brahma, furono per ogni parte\nliete gli Iddii col loro duce Indra. In questo mezzo qui sopravvenne raggiante\nd\'immensa luce il venerando Visnu, pensato da Brahma nell\' immortal sua mente,\nsiccome atto ad estirpar colui; Allora Brahma colla schiera de\' Celesti cosi\nparlo a Visnu: Tu sei il conforto delle gente oppresse, O distruttor di Madhu:\nnoi quindi a te supplichiamo afflitti: sia tu nostro sostegno, O Aciuto. Dite,\nloro rispose Visnu, quale cosa io debba far per voi; e gli Dei, udite queste\nparole, cosi soggiunsero: Un re per nome Dasaratha, giusto, virtuoso, veridico\ne pio, non ha progenie e la desidera: ei gia s\' impose durissime penitenze, ed\nora ha sacrificato con un Asvamedha: tu, per nostro consiglio, O Visnu,\nconsenti a divenir suo figlio: fatte di te quattro parti, ti manifesta, O\ninvocato dalle genti, nel seno delle quattro sue consorti, simili alla venusta\nDea. Cosi esortato dagli Dei quivi presenti, l\'augusto Narayana loro rispose\nqueste opportune parole: Quale opra s\'ha da me, fatto visible nel mondo, a\ncompiere per voi, O Devi? e d\'onde in voi cotal terrore? Intese le parole di\nVisnu, cosi risposero gli Dei: ll nostro terrore, O Visnu, nasce da un Racsaso\nper nome Ravano, spavento dell\' universo. Vestendo umano corpo, tu debhi\nesterminar costui. Nessuno fra i Celesti, fuorche tu solo, e valevole ad\nuccidere quell\' iniquo. Egli, O domator de\' tuoi nemici, sostenne per lungo\ntempo acerbissime\n\np. 514\n\nmacerazioni: per esse fu di lui contento l\'augusto sommo Genitore: a un di gli\naccordo propizio la sicurezza da tutti gli esseri, eccettutine gli nomini. Per\nquesto favore a lui concesso non ha egli a temere offesa da alcuna parte,\nfuorche dall\' uomo, percio, assumendo la natura umana, costui tu uccidi. Egli,\nil peggior di tutti i Racsasi, insano per la forza che gli infonde il dono\navuto, da travaglio ai Devi ed ai Gaudharvi, ai Risci, ai Muni ed ai mortali.\nEgli, sicuro da morte pel favore ottenuto, e turbatore dei sacrifizj, nemico\ned uccisor dei Brahmi, divoratore degli uomini, peste del mondo. Da lui furono\nassaliti re coi loro carri ed elefanti; altri percossi e fugati si dispersero\nper ogni dove. Da lui furono divorati Risci ed Apsarase: egli insomma\noltracotato continuamente e quasi per ischerzo tutti travaglia i sette mondi.\nPercio, O terribile ai nemici e stabilita la morte di costui per opra d\'un\nuomo; poich\' un di per superbia del dono tutti sprezzo gli uomini. Tu, O\nsupremo fra i Numi, dei, umanandoti, estirpare questo tremendo, superbo\nRavano, oltracotato, a noi nemico, terrore e flagello dei penitenti.\n\nGORRESIO.\n\nXIV.\n\nDe nouveau Rishya\xc3\xa7ringa tint ce langage au Monarque: "Je vais celebrer un\nautre sacrifice, afin que le ciel accorde a tes voeux les enfants que tu\nsouhaites." Cela dit, cherchant le bonheur du roi et pour l\'accomplissement de\nson desir, le fils puissant de Vibhandaka se mit a celebrer ce nouveau\nsacrifice.\n\nLa auparavant, etaient venus deja recevoir une part de l\'offrande les Dieux,\naccompagnes des Gaudharvas, et les Siddhas avec les Mounis divins, Brahma, le\nmonarque des Souras, l\'immuable S\'iva, et l\'auguste Narayana, et les quatre\ngardiens vigilants du monde, et les meres des Immortels, et tous les Dieux,\nescortes des Yakshas, et le maitre eminent du ciel, Indra, qui se manifestait\naux yeux, environne par l\'essaim des Maroutes. Alors ce jeune anachorete avait\nsupplie tous les Dieux, que le desir d\'une part dans l\'offrande avait conduits\na l\' a\xc3\xa7wamedha, cette grande ceremonie de ce roi magnanime; _et, dans ce\nmoment, l\' epoux de S\'anta les conjurait ainsi pour la seconde fois_: "Cet\nhomme _en pri eres_, c\'est le roi Da\xc3\xa7aratha, qui est prive de fils. Il est\nrempli d\' une foi vive; il s\'est inflige de penibles austerites; il vous a\ndeja servi, divinites augustes, le sacrifice d\'un a\xc3\xa7wa-medha, et maintenant il\ns\'etudie encore a vous plaire avec ce nouveau sacrifice dans l\'esperance que\nvous lui donnerez les fils, ou tendent ses desirs. Versez donc sur lui votre\nbienveillance et daignez sourire a son voeu pour des fils. C\'est pour lui que\nmoi ici, les mains jointes, je vous adresse a tous mes supplications: envoyez-\nlui quatre fils, qui soient vantes dans les trois mondes!"\n\n"Oui! repondirent les Dieux au fils suppliant du rishi; tu merites que nous\nt\'ecoutions avec faveur, toi, brahme saint, et meme, en premier lieu, ce roi.\nComme recompense de ces differents sacrifices, le monarque obtendra cet objet\nle plus cher de ses desirs."\n\nAyant aussi parle et vu que le grand saint avait mis fin suivant les rites a\nson _pieux_ sacrifice, les Dieux, Indra a leur tete, s\'evanouissent dans le\nvide des airs et se rendent vers l\'architecte des mondes, le souverain des\ncreatures, le donateur des biens, vers Brahma enfin, auquel tous, les mains\njointes, ils adressent les paroles suivantes: "O Brahma, un rakshasa, nomme\nRavana, tourne au\n\np. 515\n\nmal les graces, qu\'il a re\xc3\xa7ues de toi. Dans son orgueil, il nous opprime tous;\nil opprime avec nous les grands anchoretes, qui se font un bonheur des\nmacerations: car jadis, ayant su te plaire, O Bhagavat, il a re\xc3\xa7u de toi ce\ndon incomparable. "Oui, as-tu dit, exau\xc3\xa7ant le voeu du mauvais Genie; Dieu.\nYaksha ou Demon ne pourra jamais causer ta mort!" Et nous, par qui ta parole\nest respectee, nous avons tout supporte de ce roi des rakshasas, qui ecrase de\nsa tyrannie les trois mondes, ou il promene l\'injure impunement. Enorgueilli\nde ce don victorieux, il opprime indignement les Dieux, les rishis, les\nYakshas, les Gandharvas, les Asouras et les enfants de Manon. La ou se tient\nRavana, la peur empeche le soleil d\'echauffer, le vent craint de souffler, et\nle feu n\'ose flamboyer. A son aspect, la guirlande meme des grands flots\ntremble au sein de la mer. Aceable par sa vigueur indomptable, Kouvera defait\nlui a cede Lanka. Suave-nous donc, o toi, qui reposes dans le bonheur absolu;\nsauve-nous de Ravana, le fleau des mondes. Daigne, o toi, qui souris aux voeux\ndu suppliant, daigne imaginer un expedient pour oter la vie a ce cruel Demon."\nLes Dieux ayant ainsi denonce leurs maux a Brahma, il reflechit un instant et\nleur tint ce langage: "Bien, voici que j\'ai decouvert un moyen pour tuer ce\nGenie scelerat. Que ni les Dieux, a-t-il dit, ni les rishis, ni les Gandharvas\nni les Yakshas, ni les rakshasas, ni les Nagas meme ne puissent me donner la\nmort! Soit lui ai-je repondu. Mais, par dedain pour la force humaine, les\nhommes n\'ont pas ete compris dans sa demande. C\'est donc par la main d\' un\nhomme, qu\'il faut immoler ce mechant." Ainsi tombee de la bouche du createur,\ncette parole salutaire satisfit pleinement le roi des habitants du ciel et\ntous les Dieux avec lui. La, dans ce meme instant, survint le fortune Visnou,\nrevetu d\' une splendeur infinie; car c\'etait a lui, que Brahma avait pense\ndans son ame pour la mort du tyran. Celui-ci donc avec l\'essaim des Immortels\nadresse a Vishnou ces paroles: "Meurtrier de Madhou, comrae tu aimes a tirer\nde l\' affliction les etres malheureux, nous te supplions, nous qui sommes\nplonges dans la tristesse, Divinite auguste, sois notre asyle!" "Dites! reprit\nVishnou; que dois-je faire? "Ayant oui les paroles de l\' ineffable, tous les\nDieux repondirent: "Il est un roi nomme Da\xc3\xa7aratha; il a embrasse une tres-dure\npenitence; il a celebre meme le sacrifice d\'un a\xc3\xa7wa-medha, parce qu\'il n\'a\npoint de fils et qu\'il veut en obtenir du ciel. Il est inebranlable dans sa\npiete, il est vante pour ses vertus; la justice est son caractere, la verite\nest sa parole. Acquiesce donc a notre demande, o toi, Vishnou, et consens a\nnaitre comme son fils. Divise en quatre portions de toi-meme, daigne, o toi\nqui foules aux pieds tes ennemis, daigne t\' incarner dans le sein de ses trois\nepouses, belles comme la deesse de la beaute." Narayana, le maitre, _non,\nperceptible aux sens, mais qui alors s\' etait rendu_ visible, Narayana\nrepondit cette parole salutaire aux Dieux, qui i invitaient a cet _heroique av\natara_. Quelle chose, une fois revetu de cette incarnation, faudra-t-il encore\nque je fasse pour vous, et de quelle part vient la terreur, qui vous trouble\nainsi?\' A ces mots du grand Vishnou: "C\'est le demon Ravana, reprirent les\nDieux; c\'est lui, Vishnou, cette desolation des mondes, qui nous inspire un\ntel effroi. Enveloppe-toi d\' un corps, humain, et qu\'il te plaise arracher du\nmonde cette blessante epine; car nul autre que toi parmi les habitants du ciel\nn\'est capable d\'immoler ce pecheur. _Sache que_ longtemps il s\'est impose la\nplus austere penitence, et _que_ par elle il s\'est rendu agreable au supreme\nayeul de toutes les creatures. Aussi le distributeur ineffable des graces lui\na-t-il accorde ce don insigne d\'etre invulnerable a tous les etres, l\'\n\np. 516\n\nhomme seul excepte. Puisque, doue ainsi de cette faveur, la mort terrible et\ns*ure ne peut venir a lui de nulle autre part que de l\'homme, va, dompteur\n_puissant_ de tes ennemis, va dans la condition humaine, et tue-le. Car ce\ndon, auquel on ne peut resister, elevant au plus haut point l\'ivresse de sa\nforce, le vil rakshasa, tourmente les Dieux, les rishis, les Gandharvas, les\nhommes sanctifies par la penitence; et, quoique, destructeur des sacrifices,\nlacerateur des Saintes E*critures, ennemi des brahmes, devorateur des hommes,\ncette faveur incomparable sauve de la mort Ravana le triste fleau des mondes.\nIl ose attaquer les rois, que defendant les chars de guerre, que remparent les\nelephants: d\'autres blesses et mis en fuite, sont dissipes \xc3\xa7a et la devant\nlui.

Even if the story were not complete, the\nconclusion of the last Canto of the sixth Book, evidently the work of a later\nhand than Valmiki\'s, which speaks of Rama\'s glorious and happy reign and\npromises blessings to those who read and hear the Ramayan, would be sufficient\nto show that, when these verses were added, the poem was considered to be\nfinished. The Uttarakanda or Last Book is merely an appendix or a supplement\nand relates only events antecedent and subsequent to those described in the\noriginal poem. Indian scholars however, led by reverential love of tradition,\nunanimously ascribe this Last Book to Valmiki, and regard it as part of the\nRaamayan.\n\nSignor Gorresio has published an excellent translation of the Uttarakanda, in\nItalian prose, from the recension current in Bengal; 1 and Mr. Muir has\nepitomized a portion of the book in the Appendix to the Fourth Part of his\nSanskrit Texts (1862). From these scholars I borrow freely in the following\npages, and give them my hearty thanks for saving me much wearisome labour.\n\np. 517\n\n"After Rama had returned to Ayodhya and taken possession of the throne, the\nrishis [saints} assembled to greet him, and \xc3\x81gastya, in answer to his\nquestions recounted many particulars regarding his old enemies. In the Krita\nYuga (or Golden Age) the austere and pious Brahman rishi Pulastya, a son of\nBrahma, being teased with the visits of different damsels, proclaimed that any\none of them whom he again saw near his hermitage should become pregnant. This\nhad not been heard by the daughter of the royal rishi Trinavindu, who one day\ncame into Pulastya\'s neighbourhood, and her pregnancy was the result (Sect. 2,\nvv. 14 ff.). After her return home, her father, seeing her condition, took her\nto Pulastya, who accepted her as his wife, and she bore a son who received the\nname of Vis\'ravas. This son was, like his father, an austere and religious\nsage. He married the daughter of the muni Bharadvaja, who bore him a son to\nwhom Brahma gave the name of Vais\'ravan--Kuvera (Sect. 3, vv. I ff). He\nperformed austerities for thousands of years, when he obtained from Brahma as\na boon that he should be one of the guardians of the world (along with Indra,\nVaruna, and Yama) and the god of riches. He afterwards consulted his father\nVis\'ravas about an abode, and at his suggestion took possession of the city of\nLanka, which had formerly been built by Vis\'vakarman for the Raxasas, but had\nbeen abandoned by them through fear of Vishnu, and was at that time\nunoccupied. Rama then (Sect. 4) says he is surprised to hear that Lanka had\nformerly belonged to the Raxasas, as he had always understood that they were\nthe descendants of Pulastya, and now he learns that they had also another\norigin. He therefore asks who was their ancestor, and what fault they had\ncommitted that they were chased away by Vishnu. \xc3\x80gastya replies that when\nBrahma created the waters, he formed certain beings,--some of whom received\nthe name of Raxasas,--to guard them. The first Raxasa kings were Heti and\nPraheti. Heti married a sister of Kala (Time). She bore him a son Vidyutkes\'a,\nwho in his turn took for his wife Lankatankata, the daughter of Sandhya (V.\n21). She bore him a son Sukes\'a, whom she abandoned, but he was seen by S\'iva\nas he was passing by with his wife Parvati, who made the child as old as his\nmother, and immortal, and gave him a celestial city. Sukes\'a married a\nGandharvi called Devavati who bore three sons, Malyavat, Sumali and Mali.\nThese sons practised intense austerities, when Brahma appeared and conferred\non them invincibility and long life. They then harassed the gods. Vis\'vakarman\ngave them a city, Lanka, on the mountain Trikuta, on the shore of\n\np. 518\n\nthe southern ocean, which he had built at the command of Indra....The three\nRaxasas, Malyavat and his two brothers, then began to oppress the gods,\nrishis, etc.; who (Sect. 6, v.1 ff.) in consequence resort for aid to\nMahadeva, who having regard to his protege Sukes\'a the father of Malyavat,\nsays that he cannot kill the Raxasas. but advises the suppliants\n[*supplicants?*} to go to Vishnu, which they do, and receive from him a\npromise that he will destroy their enemies. The three Raxasa kings, hearing of\nthis, consult together, and proceed to heaven to attack the gods. Vishnu\nprepares to meet them. The battle is described in the seventh section. The\nRaxasas are defeated by Vishnu with great slaughter, and driven back to Lanka,\none of their leaders, Mali, being slain. Malyavat remonstrates with. Vishnu,\nwho was assaulting the rear of the fugitives, for his unwarrior-like conduct,\nand wishes to renew the combat (Sect. 8, v. 3 ff.). Vishnu replies that he\nmust fulfil his promise to the gods by slaying the Raxasas, and that he would\ndestroy them even if they fled to Patala. These Raxasas, Agastya says, were\nmore powerful than Ravana, and, could only be destroyed by Narayana, _i.e._ by\nRama himself, the eternal, indestructible god. Sumali with his family lived\nfor along time in Patala, while Kuvera dwelt in Lanka. In section 9 it is\nrelated that Sumali once happened to visit the earth, when he observed Kuvera\ngoing in his chariot to see his father Vis\'ravas. This leads him to consider\nhow he might restore his own fortunes. He consequently desires his daughter\nKaikasi to go and woo Vis\'ravas, who receives her graciously. She becomes the\nmother of the dreadful Ravana, of the huge Kumbhakarna, of Surpanakha, and of\nthe righteous Vibhishana, who was the last son. These children grow up in the\nforest. Kumbhakarna goes about eating rishis. Kuvera comes to visit his\nfather, when Kaikasi takes occasion to urge her son Ravana to strive to become\nlike his brother (Kuvera) in splendour. This Ravana promises to do. He then\ngoes to the hermitage of Gokarna with his brothers to perform austerity. In\nsection 10 their austere observances are described: after a thousand years\'\npenance Ravana throws his head into the fire. He repeats this oblation nine\ntimes after equal intervals, and is about to do it the tenth time, when Brahma\nappears, and offers a boon. Ravana asks immortality, but is refused. He then\nasks that he may be indestructible by all creatures more powerful than men;\nwhich boon is accorded by Brahma together with the recovery of all the heads\nhe had sacrificed and the power of assuming any shape he pleased. Vibhishana\nasks as his boon that "even amid the greatest calamities he may think only of\nrighteousness, and that the weapon of Brahma may appear to him unlearnt, etc.\nThe god grants his request, and adds the gift of immortality. When Brahma is\nabout to offer a boon to Kumbhakarna, the gods interpose, as, they say, he had\neaten seven Apsarases and ten followers of Indra, besides rishis and men; and\nbeg that under the guise of a boon stupefaction may be inflicted on him.\nBrahma thinks on Sarasvati, who arrives and, by Brahma\'s command, enters into\nKumbhakarna\'s mouth that she may speak for him. Under this influence he asks\nthat he may receive the boon of sleeping for many years, which is granted.\nWhen however Sarasvati has left him, and he recovers his own consciousness, he\nperceives that he has been deluded. Kuvera by his father\'s advice, gives up\nthe city of Lanka to Ravana." 1 Ravana marries (Sect. 12,) Mandodari the\nbeautiful daughter of the Asur Maya whose\n\np. 519\n\nname has several times occurred in the Ramayan as that of an artist of\nwonderful skill. She bears a son Meghanada or the Roaring Cloud who was\nafterwards named Indrajit from his victory over the sovereign of the skies.\nThe conquest of Kuvera, and the acquisition of the magic self-moving chariot\nwhich has done much service in the Ramayan, form the subject of sections\nXIII., XIV. and XV. "The rather pretty story of Vedavati is related in the\nseventeenth section, as follows: Ravana in the course of his progress through\nthe world, comes to the forest on the Himalaya, where he sees a damsel of\nbrilliant beauty, but in ascetic garb, of whom he straightway becomes\nenamoured. He tells her that such an austere life is unsuited to her youth and\nattractions, and asks who she is and why she is leading an ascetic existence.\nShe answers that she is called Vedavati, and is the vocal daughter of\nVrihaspati\'s son, the rishi Kus\'adhvaja, sprung from him during his constant\nstudy of the Veda. The gods, gandharvas, etc., she says, wished that she\nshould choose a husband, but her father would give her to no one else than to\nVishnu, the lord of the world, whom he desired for his son-in-law. Vedavati\nthen proceeds: "In order that I may fulfil this desire of my father in respect\nof Narayana, I wed him with my heart. Having entered into this engagement I\npractise great austerity. Narayana and no other than he, Purushottama, is my\nhusband. From the desire of obtaining him, I resort to this severe observance.\nRavana\'s passion is not in the least diminished by this explanation and he\nurges that it is the old alone who should seek to become distinguished by\naccumulating merit through austerity, prays that she who is so young and\nbeautiful shall become his bride; and boasts that he is superior to Vishnu.\nShe rejoins that no one but be would thus contemn that deity. On receiving\nthis reply he touches the hair of her head with the tip of his finger. She is\ngreatly incensed, and forthwith cuts off her hair and tells him that as he has\nso insulted her, she cannot continue to live, but will enter into the fire\nbefore his eyes. She goes on "Since I have been insulted in the forest by thee\nwho art wicked-hearted, I shall be born again for thy destruction. For a man\nof evil desire cannot be slain by a woman; and the merit of my austerity would\nbe lost if I were to launch a curse against thee. But if I have performed or\nbestowed or sacrificed aught may I be born the virtuous daughter, not produced\nfrom the womb, of a righteous man." Having thus spoken she entered, the\nblazing fire. Then a shower of celestial flowers fell (from every part of the\nsky). It is she, lord, who, having been Vedavati in the Krita age, has been\nborn (in the Treta age) as the daughter of the king of the Janakas, and (has\nbecome) thy [Rama\'s] bride; for thou art the eternal Vishnu. The mountain-like\nenemy who was [virtually] destroyed before by her wrath, has now been slain by\nher having recourse to thy superhuman energy." On this the commentator\nremarks: "By this it is signified that Sita was the principal cause of\nRavana\'s death; but the function of destroying him is ascribed to Rama." On\nthe words,"thou art Vishnu," in the preceding verse the same commentator\nremarks: "By this it is clearly affirmed that Sita was Laxmi. This is what\nParas\'ara says: "In the god\'s life as Rama, she became Sita, and in his birth\nas Krishna [she became] Rukmini." 1\n\nIn the following section (XVIII.) "Ravana is described as violently\ninterrupting a sacrifice which is being performed by king Marutta, and the\nassembled\n\np. 520\n\ngods in terror assume different shapes to escape; Indra becomes a peacock,\nYama a crow, Kuvera a lizard, and Varuna a swan; and each deity bestows a boon\non the animal he had chosen. The peacock\'s tail recalls Indra\'s thousand eyes;\nthe swan\'s colour becomes white, like the foam of the ocean (Varuna being its\nlord); the lizard obtains a golden colour; and the crow is never to die except\nwhen killed by a violent death, and the dead are to enjoy the funeral\noblations when they have been devoured by the crows."  1\n\nRavan then attacks Arjuna or Karttavirya the mighty king of Mahishmati on the\nbanks of the Narmada, and is defeated, captured and imprisoned by Arjuna. At\nthe intercession of Pulastya (Sect. XXII.) he is released from his bonds. He\nthen visits Kishkindha where he enters into alliance with Bali the King of the\nVanars: "We will have all things in common," says Ravan, "dames, sons, cities\nand kingdoms, food, vesture, and all delights." His next exploit is the\ninvasion of the kingdom of departed spirits and his terrific battle with the\nsovereign Yama. The poet in his description of these regions with the detested\nriver with waves of blood, the dire lamentations, the cries for a drop of\nwater, the devouring worm, all the tortures of the guilty and the somewhat\ninsipid pleasures of the just, reminds one of the scenes in the under world so\nvividly described by Homer, Virgil, and Dante. Yama is defeated (Sect. XXVI.)\nby the giant, not so much by his superior power as because at the request of\nBrahma Yama refrains from smiting with his deadly weapon the Rakshas enemy to\nwhom that God had once given the promise that preserved him. In the twenty-\nseventh section Ravan goes "under the earth into Patala the treasure-house of\nthe waters inhabited by swarms of serpents and Daityas, and well defended by\nVarun." He subdues Bhogavati the city ruled by Vasuki and reduces the Nagas or\nserpents to subjection. He penetrates even to the imperial seat of Varun. The\nGod himself is absent, but his sons come forth and do battle with the invader.\nThe giant is victorious and departs triumphant. The twenty-eighth section\ngives the details of a terrific battle between Ravan and Mandhata King of\nAyodhya, a distinguished ancestor of Rama. Supernatural weapons are employed\non both sides and the issue of the conflict is long doubtful. But at last\nMandhata prepares to use the mighty weapon "acquired by severe austerities\nthrough the grace and favour of Rudra." The giant would inevitably have been\nslain. But two pre-eminent Munis Pulastya and Galava beheld the fight through\nthe power given by contemplation, and with words of exhortation they parted\nKing Mandhata and the sovereign of the Rakshases. Ravan at last (Sect. XXXII.)\nreturns homeward carrying with him in his car Pushpak the virgin daughters of\nkings, of Rishis, of Daityas, and Gandharvas whom he has seized upon his way.\nThe thirty-sixth section describes a battle with Indra. in which the\nvictorious Meghanada son of the giant, makes the King of the Gods his\nprisoner, binds him with his magic art, and carries him away (Sect. XXVII.) in\ntriumph to Lanka. Brahma intercedes (Sect. XXXVIII.) and Indrajit releases his\nprisoner *** obtaining in return the boon that sacrifice to the Lord of Fire\nshall always make him invincible in the coming battle. In sections XXXIX, XL,\n"we have a legend related to Rama by the sage Agastya to account for the\nstupendous strength of the monkey Hanumat, as it had been described in the _R\namayana_. Rama naturally wonders (as\n\np. 521\n\nperhaps many readers of the _R amayana_ have done since) why a monkey of such\nmarvellous power and prowess had not easily overcome Bali and secured the\nthrone for his friend Sugriva. Agastya replies that Hanumat was at that time\nunder a curse from a Rishi, and consequently was not conscious of his own\nmight."  1 The whole story of the marvellous Vanar is here given at length,\nbut nothing else of importance is added to the tale already given in the\nRamayana. The Rishis or saints then (Sect. XL.) return to their celestial\nseats, and the Vanars, Rakshases and bears also (Sect. XLIII.) take their\ndeparture. The chariot Pushpak is restored to its original owner Kuvera, as\nhas already been related in the Ramayan.\n\nThe story of Rama and Sita is then continued, and we meet with matter of more\nhuman interest. The winter is past and the pleasant spring-time is come, and\nRama and Sita sit together in the shade of the As\'oka trees happy as Indra and\nS\'achi when they drink in Paradise the nectar of the Gods. "Tell me, my\nbeloved," says Rama, "for thou wilt soon be a mother, hast thou a wish in thy\nheart for me to gratify?" And Sita smiles and answers: "I long, O son of\nRaghu, to visit the pure and holy hermitages on the banks of the Ganges and to\nvenerate the feet of the saints who there perform their rigid austerities and\nlive on roots and berries. This is my chief desire, to stand within the\nhermits\' grove were it but for a single day," And Rama said: "Let not the\nthought trouble thee: thou shalt go to the grove of the ascetics," But\nslanderous tongues have been busy in Ayodhya, and Sita has not been spared.\nRama hears that the people are lamenting his blind folly in taking back to his\nbosom the wife who was so long a captive in the palace of Ravan. Rama well\nknows her spotless purity in thought, word, and deed, and her perfect love of\nhim; but he cannot endure the mockery and the shame and resolves to abandon\nhis unsuspecting wife. He orders the sad but still obedient Lakshman to convey\nher to the hermitage which she wishes to visit and to leave her there, for he\nwill see her face again no more. They arrive at the hermitage, and Lakshman\ntells her all. She falls fainting on the ground, and when she recovers her\nconsciousness sheds some natural tears and bewails her cruel and undeserved\nlot. But she resolves to live for the sake of Rama and her unborn son, and she\nsends by Lakshman a dignified message to the husband who has forsaken her: "I\ngrieve not for myself," she says " because I have been abandoned on account of\nwhat the people say, and not for any evil that I have done, The husband is the\nGod of the wife, the husband is her lord and guide; and what seems good unto\nhim she should do even at the cost of her life."\n\nSita is honourably received by the saint Valmiki himself, and the holy women\nof the hermitage are charged to entertain and serve her. In this calm retreat\nshe gives birth to two boys who receive the names of Kus\'a and Lava. They are\ncarefully brought up and are taught by Valmiki himself to recite the Ramayan.\nThe years pass by: and Rama at length determines to celebrate the As\'vamedha\nor Sacrifice of the Steed. Valmiki, with his two young pupils, attends the\nceremony, and the unknown princes recite before the delighted father the poem\nwhich recounts his deeds. Rama inquires into their history and recognizes them\nas his sons. Sita is invited to return and solemnly affirm her innocence\nbefore the great assembly.\n\n"But Sita\'s heart was too full; this second ordeal was beyond even her. power\nto submit to, and the poet rose above the ordinary Hindu level of women\n\np. 522\n\nwhen be ventured to paint her conscious purity as rebelling: "Beholding all\nthe spectators, and clothed in red garments, Sita clasping her hands and\nbending low her face, spoke thus in a voice choked with tears: \'as I, even in\nmind, have never thought of any other than Rama, so may Madhavi the goddess of\nEarth, grant me a hiding-place.\' As Sita made this oath, lo! a marvel\nappeared. Suddenly cleaving the earth, a divine throne of marvellous beauty\nrose up, borne by resplendent dragons on their heads: and seated on it, the\ngoddess of Earth, raising Sita with her arm, said to her, \'Welcome to thee!\'\nand placed her by her side. And as the queen, seated on the throne, slowly\ndescended to Hades, a continuous shower of flowers fell down from heaven on\nher head."  1\n\n"Both the great Hindu epics thus end in disappointment and sorrow. In the _Mah\nabharata_ the five victorious brothers abandon the hardly won throne to die\none by one in a forlorn pilgrimage to the Himalaya; and in the same way Rama\nonly regains his wife, after all his toils, to lose her. It is the same in the\nlater Homeric cycle-the heroes of the _Iliad_ perish by ill-fated deaths. And\neven Ulysses, after his return to Ithaca, sets sail again to Thesprotia, and\nfinally falls by the hand of his own son. But in India and Greece alike this\nis an afterthought of a self-conscious time, which has been subsequently added\nto cast a gloom on the strong cheerfulness of the heroic age."  2\n\n"The termination of Rama\'s terrestrial career is thus told in Sections 116 ff.\nof the Uttarakanda. Time, in the form of an ascetic, comes to his palace gate,\nand asks, as the messenger of the great rishi (Brahma) to see Rama. He is\nadmitted and received with honour, but says, when he is asked what he has to\ncommunicate, that his message must be delivered in private, and that any one\nwho witnesses the interview is to lose his life. Rama informs Laxmana of all\nthis, and desires him to stand outside. Time then tells Rama that he has been\nsent by Brahma, to say that when he (Rama, i.e. Vishnu) after destroying the\nworlds was sleeping on the ocean, he had formed him (Brahma) from the lotus\nspringing from his navel, and committed to him the work of creation; that he\n(Brahma) had then entreated Rama to assume the function of Preserver, and that\nthe latter had in consequence become Vishnu, being born as the son of Aditi,\nand had determined to deliver mankind by destroying Ravana, and to live on\nearth ten thousand and ten hundred years; that period, adds Time, was now on\nthe eve of expiration, and Rama could either at his pleasure prolong his stay\non earth, or ascend to heaven and rule over the gods, Rama replies, that he\nhad been born for the good of the three worlds, and would now return to the\nplace whence he had come, as it was his function to fulfil the purposes of the\ngods. While they are speaking the irritable rishi Durvasas comes, and insists\non seeing Rama immediately, under a threat, if refused, of cursing Rama and\nall his family.\n\nLaxmana, preferring to save his kinsman, though knowing that his own death\nmust he the consequence of interrupting the interview of Rama with Time,\nenters the palace and reports the rishi\'s message to Rama. Rama comes out, and\n\np. 523\n\nwhen Durvasas has got the food he wished, and departed, Rama reflects with\ngreat distress on the words of Time, which require that Laxmana should die.\nLaxmana however exhorts Rama not to grieve, but to abandon him and not break\nhis own promise. The counsellors concurring in this advice, Rama abandons\nLaxmana, who goes to the river Sarayu, suppresses all his senses, and is\nconveyed bodily by Indra to heaven. The gods are delighted by the arrival of\nthe fourth part of Vishnu. Rama then resolves to install Bharata as his\nsuccessor and retire to the forest and follow Laxmana. Bharata however refuses\nthe succession, and determines to accompany his brother. Rama\'s subjects are\nfilled with grief, and say they also will follow him wherever he goes.\nMessengers are sent to S\'atrughna, the other brother, and he also resolves to\naccompany Rama; who at length sets out in procession from his capital with all\nthe ceremonial appropriate to the "great departure," silent, indifferent to\nexternal objects, joyless, with S\'ri on his right, the goddess Earth on his\nleft, Energy in front, attended by all his weapons in human shapes, by the\nVedas in the forms of Brahmans, by the Gayatri, the Omkara, the Vashatkara, by\nrishis, by his women, female slaves, eunuchs, and servants. Bharata with his\nfamily, and S\'atrughna, follow together with Brahmans bearing the sacred fire,\nand the whole of the people of the country, and even with animals, etc., etc.\nRama, with all these attendants, comes to the banks of the Sarayu. Brahma,\nwith all the gods and innumerable celestial cars, now appears, and all the sky\nis refulgent with the divine splendour, Pure and fragrant breezes blow, a\nshower of flowers falls. Rama enters the waters of the Sarayu; and Brahma\nutters a voice from the sky, saying: "Approach, Vishnu; Raghava, thou hast\nhappily arrived, with thy godlike brothers. Enter thine own body as Vishnu or\nthe eternal ether. For thou art the abode of the worlds: no one comprehends\nthee, the inconceivable and imperishable, except the large-eyed Maya thy\nprimeval spouse." Hearing these words, Rama enters the glory of Vishnu with\nhis body and his followers. He then asks Brahma to find an abode for the\npeople who had accompanied him from devotion to his person, and Brahma\nappoints them a celestial residence accordingly."  1\n\np. 524\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\nQUEEN FORTUNE.\n\n\'A curious festival is celebrated in honour of this divinity (Lakshmi) on the\nfifth lunar day of the light half of the month Magha (February), when she is\nidentified with Saraswati the consort of Brahma, and the goddess of learning.\nIn his treatise on festivals, a great modern authority, Raghunandana,\nmentions, on the faith of a work called _Samvatsara-sandipa_ , that Lakshmi is\nto be worshipped in the forenoon of that day with flowers, perfumes, rice, and\nwater; that due honour is to be paid to inkstand and writing-reed, and no\nwriting to be done. Wilson, in his essay on the _Religious Festivals of the\nHindus_ (works, vol. ii, p. 188\\. ff.). adds that on the morning of the 2nd\nFebruary, the whole of the pens and inkstands, and the books, if not too\nnumerous and bulky, are collected, the pens or reeds cleaned, the inkstands\nscoured, and the books wrapped up in new cloth, are arranged upon a platform,\nor a sheet, and strewn over with flowers and blades of young barley, and that\nno flowers except white are to be offered. After performing the necessary\nrites,.........all the members of the family assemble and make their\nprostrations; the books, the pens, and ink having an entire holiday; and\nshould any emergency require a written communication on the day dedicated to\nthe divinity of scholarship, it is done with chalk or charcoal upon a black or\nwhite board.\'\n\nChambers\'s Encyclopaedia. _Lakshm i_.\n\nINDRA.\n\n\'The Hindu Jove or Jupiter Tonans, chief of the secondary deities.

William\'s English-Sanskrit Dictionary. _Indra_.\n\nVISHNU.\n\n\'The second person of the Hindu triad, and the most celebrated and popular of\nall the Indian deities. He is the personification of the preserving power, and\nbecame incarnate in nine different forms, for the preservation of mankind in\nvarious emergencies. Before the creation of the universe, and after its\ntemporary annihilation, he is supposed to sleep on the waters, floating on the\nserpent Sesha, and is then identified with Narayana. Brahma, the creator, is\nfabled to spring at that time from a lotus which grows from his navel, whilst\nthus asleep ..... ......His ten avatars or incarnations are:\n\np. 525\n\nI. The Matsya, or fish. In this avatar Vishnu descended in the form of a fish\nto save the pious king Satyavrata, who with the seven Rishis and their wives\nhad taken refuge in the ark to escape the deluge which then destroyed the\nearth. 2, The Kurma, or Tortoise. In this he descended in the form of a\ntortoise, for the purpose of restoring to man some of the comforts lost during\nthe flood. To this end he stationed himself at the bottom of the ocean, and\nallowed the point of the great mountain Mandara to be placed upon his back,\nwhich served as a hard axis, whereon the gods and demons, with the serpent\nVasuki twisted round the mountain for a rope, churned the waters for the\nrecovery of the amrita or nectar, and fourteen other sacred things. 3. The\nVaraha, or Boar. In this he descended in the form of a boar to rescue the\nearth from the power of a demon called \'golden-eyed,\' Hiranyaksha. This demon\nhad seized on the earth and carried it with him into the depths of the ocean.\nVishnu dived into the abyss, and after a contest of a thousand years slew the\nmonster. 4 The Narasinha, or Man-lion. In this monstrous shape of a creature\nhalf-man, half-lion, Vishnu delivered the earth from the tyranny of an\ninsolent demon called Hiranyakas\'ipu. 5\\. Vamana, or Dwarf. This avatar\nhappened in the second age of the Hindus or Tretayug, the four preceding are\nsaid to have occurred in the first or Satyayug; the object of this avatar was\nto trick Bali out of the dominion of the three worlds. Assuming the form of a\nwretched dwarf he appeared before the king and asked, as a boon, as much land\nas he could pace in three steps. This was granted; and Vishnu immediately\nexpanding himself till he filled the world, deprived Bali at two steps of\nheaven and earth, but in consideration of some merit, left Patala still in his\ndominion. 6. Parasurama. 7. Ramchandra, 8. Krishna, or according to some\nBalarama. 9. Buddha. In this avatar Vishnu descended in the form of a sage for\nthe purpose of making some reform in the religion of the Brahmins, and\nespecially to reclaim them from their proneness to animal sacrifice. Many of\nthe Hindus will not allow this to have been an incarnation of their favourite\ngod. 10. Kalki, or White Horse. This is yet to come. Vishnu mounted on a white\nhorse, with a drawn scimitar, blazing like a comet, will, according to\nprophecy, end this present age, viz. the fourth or Kaliyug, by destroying the\nworld, and then renovating creation by an age of purity.\'\n\nWILLIAMS\'S DICTIONARY. _Vishnu_.\n\nS\'IVA.\n\nA celebrated Hindu God, the Destroyer of creation, and therefore the most\nformidable of the Hindu Triad. He also personifies reproduction, since the\nHindu philosophy excludes the idea of total annihilation without subsequent\nregeneration. Hence he is sometimes confounded with Brahma, the creator or\nfirst person of the Triad. He is the particular God of the Tantrikas, or\nfollowers of the books called Tantras. His worshippers are termed S\'aivas, and\nalthough not so numerous as the Vaishnavas, exalt their god to the highest\nplace in the heavens, and combine in him many of the attributes which properly\nbelong to the other deities. According to them S\'iva is Time, Justice, Fire,\nWater, the Sun, the Destroyer and Creator. As presiding over generation, his\ntype is the Linga, or Phallus, the origin probably of the Phallic emblem of\nEgypt and Greece. As the God of generation and justice, which latter character\nhe shares with the god Yama, he is represented riding a white bull. His own\ncolour, as well as that of the bull, is generally white, referring probably to\nthe unsullied purity of Justice,\n\np. 526\n\nHis throat is dark-blue; his hair of alight reddish colour, and thickly matted\ntogether, and gathered above his head like the hair of an ascetic. He is\nsometimes seen with two hands, sometimes with four, eight, or ten, and with\nfive faces. He has three eyes, one being in the centre of his forehead,\npointing up and down. These are said to denote his view of the three divisions\nof time, past, present, and future. He holds a trident in his hand to denote,\nas some say, his relationship to water, or according to others, to show that\nthe three great attributes of Creator, Destroyer, and Regenerator are combined\nin him. His loins are enveloped in a tiger\'s skin. In his character of Time,\nhe not only presides over its extinction, but also its astronomical\nregulation. A crescent or half-moon on his forehead indicates the measure of\ntime by the phases of the moon; a serpent forms one of his necklaces to denote\nthe measure of time by years, and a second necklace of human skulls marks the\nlapse and revolution of ages, and the extinction and succession of the\ngenerations of mankind. He is often represented as entirely covered with\nserpents, which are the emblems of immortality. They are bound in his hair,\nround his neck, wrists, waist, arms and legs; they serve as rings for his\nfingers, and earrings for his ears, and are his constant companions, S\'iva has\nmore than a thousand names which are detailed at length in the sixty-ninth\nchapter of the S\'iva Puran\'a.--WILLIAMS\'S DICTIONARY, S\'iva.\n\nAPSARASES.\n\n   \'Originally these deities seem to have been personifications of the vapours\nwhich are attracted by the sun, and form into mist or clouds: their character\nmay be thus interpreted in the few hymns of the Rigveda where mention is made\nof them. At a subsequent period when the Gandharva of the Rigveda who\npersonifies there especially the Fire of the Sun, expanded into the Fire of\nLightning, the rays of the moon and other attributes of the elementary life of\nheaven as well as into pious acts referring to it, the Apsarasas become\ndivinities which represent phenomena or objects both of a physical and ethical\nkind closely associated with that life; thus in the _Yajurveda_ Sunbeams are\ncalled the Apsarasas associated with the Gandharva who is the Sun; Plants are\ntermed the Apsarasas connected with the Gandharva Fire: Constellations are the\nApsarasas of the Gandharva Moon: Waters the Apsarasas of the Gandharva Wind,\netc. etc.................... In the last Mythological epoch when the\nGandharvas have saved from their elementary nature merely so much as to be\nmusicians in the paradise of Indra, the Apsarasas appear among other\nsubordinate deities which share in the merry life of Indra\'s heaven, as the\nwives of the Gandharvas, but more especially as wives of a licentious sort,\nand they are promised therefore, too, as a reward to heroes fallen in battle\nwhen they are received in the paradise of Indra; and while, in the Rigveda,\nthey assist Soma to pour down his floods, they descend in the epic literature\non earth merely to shake the virtue of penitent Sages and to deprive them of\nthe power they would otherwise have acquired through unbroken austerities.\'--\nGOLDST\xc3\x9cCKER\'S Sanskrit Dictionary.\n\nVISHN\'U\'S INCARNATION AS R\xc3\x81MA.\n\n\'Here is described one of the _avat ars_, descents or manifestations of\nVishn\'u in a visible form. The word _avat ar_ signifies literally _descent_.\nThe _avat ar_ which is here spoken of, that in which, according to Indian\ntraditions, Vishn\'u descended\n\np. 527\n\nand appeared upon earth in the corporeal form of Rama, the hero of the\nRamayana, is the seventh in the series of Indian avatars. Much has been said\nbefore now of these avatars, and through deficient knowledge of the ideas and\ndoctrines of India, they have been compared to the sublime dogma of the\nChristian Incarnation. This is one of the grossest errors that ignorance of\nthe ideas and beliefs of a people has produced. Between the avatars of India\nand the Christian Incarnation there is such an immensity of difference that it\nis impossible to find any reasonable analogy that can approximate them. The\nidea of the avatars is intimately united with that of the Trimurti; the bond\nof connection between these two ideas is an essential notion common to both,\nthe notion of Vishnu. What is the Trimurti? I have already said that it is\ncomposed of three Gods, Brahma (masculine), Vishnu the God of _avat ars_, and\nS\'iva. These three Gods, who when reduced to their primitive and most simple\nexpression are but three cosmogonical personifications, three powers or forces\nof nature, these Gods, I say, are here found, according to Indian doctrines,\nentirely external to the true God of India, or Brahma in the neuter gender.\nBrahma is alone, unchangeable in the midst of creation: all emanates from him,\nhe comprehends all, but he remains extraneous to all: he is Being and the\nnegation of beings. Brahma is never worshipped; the indeterminate Being is\nnever invoked; he is inaccessible to the prayers as the actions of man;\nhumanity, as well as nature, is extraneous to him. External to Brahma rises\nthe Trimurti, that is to say, Brahma (masculine) the power which creates,\nVishnu the power which preserves, and S\'iva the power which destroys: theogony\nhere commences at the same time with cosmogony. The three divinities of the\nTrimurti govern the phenomena of the universe and influence all nature. The\nreal God of India is by himself without power; real efficacious power is\nattributed only to three divinities who exist externally to him. Brahma,\nVishnu, and S\'iva, possessed of qualities in part contradictory and attributes\nthat are mutually exclusive, have no other accord or harmony than that which\nresults from the power of things itself, and which is found external to their\nown thoughts. Such is the Indian Trimurti. What an immense difference between\nthis Triad and the wonderful Trinity of Christianity! Here there is only one\nGod, who created all, provides for all, governs all. He exists in three\nPersons equal to one another, and intimately united in one only infinite and\neternal substance. The Father represents the eternal thought and the power\nwhich created, the Son infinite love, the Holy Spirit universal\nsanctification. This one and triune God completes by omnipotent power the\ngreat work of creation which, when it has come forth from His hands, proceeds\nin obedience to the laws which He has given it, governed with certain order by\nHis infinite providence.\n\nThe immense difference between the Trimurti of India and the Christian Trinity\nis found again between the avatars of Vishnu and the Incarnation of Christ.\nThe avatar was effected altogether externally to the Being who is in India\nregarded as the true God, The manifestation of one essentially cosmogonical\ndivinity wrought for the most part only material and cosmogonical prodigies.\nAt one time it takes the form of the gigantic tortoise which sustains Mount\nMandar from sinking in the ocean; at another of the fish which raises the lost\nVeda from the bottom of the sea, and saves mankind from the waters. When these\navatars are not cosmogonical they consist in some protection accorded to\n\np. 528\n\nmen or Gods, a protection which is neither universal nor permanent. The very\nmanner in which the _avat ar_ is effected corresponds to its material nature,\nfor instance the mysterious vase and the magic liquor by means of which the\n_avat ar_ here spoken of takes place. What are the forms which Vishn\'u takes\nin his descents? They are the simple forms of life; he becomes a tortoise, a\nboar, a fish, but he is not obliged to take the form of intelligence and\nliberty, that is to say, the form of man, In the avatar of Vishn\'u is\ndiscovered the inpress of pantheistic ideas which have always more or less\nprevailed in India. Does the avatar produce a permanent and definitive result\nin the world? By no means. It is renewed at every catastrophe either of nature\nor man, and its effects are only transitory........... To sum up then, the\nIndian _avat ar_ is effected externally to the true God of India, to Brahma;\nit has only a cosmogonical or historical mission which is neither lasting nor\ndecisive; it is accomplished by means of strange prodigies and magic\ntransformations; it may assume promiscuously all the forms of life; it may be\nrepeated indefinitely. Now let the whole of this Indian idea taken from\nprimitive tradition be compared with the Incarnation of Christ and it will be\nseen that there is between the two an irreconcilable difference. According to\nthe doctrines of Christianity the Everlasting Word, Infinite Love, the Son of\nGod, and equal to Him, assumed a human body, and being born as a man\naccomplished by his divine act the great miracle of the spiritual redemption\nof man. His coming had for its sole object to bring erring and lost humanity\nback to Him; this work being accomplished, and the divine union of men with\nGod being re-established, redemption is complete and remains eternal.\n\n   The superficial study of India produced in the last century many erroneous\nideas, many imaginary and false parallels between Christianity and the\nBrahmanical religion. A profounder knowledge of Indian civilization and\nreligion, and philological studies enlarged and guided by more certain\nprinciples have dissipated one by one all those errors. The attributes of the\nChristian God, which by one of those intellectual errors, which Vico\nattributes to the vanity of the learned, had been transferred to Vishnu, have\nby a better inspired philosophy been reclaimed for Christianity, and the\nresult of the two religions, one immovable and powerless, the other diffusing\nitself with all its inherent force and energy, has shown further that there is\na difference, a real opposition, between the two principles.\'--GORRESIO.\n\nKUS\'A AND LAVA, Page 10.\n\n   As the story of the banishment of Sita and the subsequent birth in\nValmiki\'s hermitage of Kus\'a and Lava the rhapsodists of the Ramayan, is\nintimately connected with the account in the introductory cantos of Valmiki\'s\ncomposition of the poem, I shall, I trust, be pardoned for extracting it from\nmy rough translation of Kalidasa\'s Raghuvan\'s\'a, parts only of which have been\noffered to the public.\n\n\'Then, day by day, the husband\'s hope grew high,  \nGazing with love on Sita\'s melting eye:  \nWith anxious care he saw her pallid cheek,  \nAnd fondly bade her all her wishes speak.  \n\'Once more I fain would see,\' the lady cried,  \n\'The sacred groves that rise on Ganga\'s side,  \n\np. 529  \n\nWhere holy grass is ever fresh and green,  \nAnd cattle feeding on the rice are seen:  \nThere would I rest awhile, where once I strayed  \nLinked in sweet friendship to each hermit maid.\'  \nAnd Rama smiled upon his wife, and sware,  \nWith many a tender oath, to grant her prayer.  \nIt chanced, one evening, from a lofty seat  \nHe viewed Ayodhya stretched before his feet:  \nHe looked with pride upon the royal road  \nLined with gay shops their glittering stores that showed,  \nHe looked on Sarju\'s silver waves, that bore  \nThe light barks flying with the sail and oar;  \nHe saw the gardens near the town that lay,  \nFilled with glad citizens and boys at play.  \nThen swelled the monarch *bosom with delight,  \nAnd his heart triumphed at the happy sight.  \nHe turned to Bhadra, standing by his side,--  \nUpon whose secret news the king relied.--  \nAnd bade him say what people said and thought  \nOf all the exploits that his arm had wrought.  \nThe spy was silent, but, when questioned still.  \nThus spake, obedient to his master\'s will:  \n\'For all thy deeds in peace and battle done  \nThe people praise thee. King, except for one:  \nThis only act of all thy life they blame,--  \nThy welcome home of her, thy ravished dame.\'  \nLike iron yielding to the iron\'s blow.  \nSank Rama, smitten by those words of woe.  \nHis breast, where love and fear for empire vied,  \nSwayed, like a rapid swing, from side to side.  \nShall he this rumour scorn, which blots his life,  \nOr banish her, his dear and spotless wife?  \nBut rigid Duty left no choice between  \nHis perilled honour and his darling queen.  \nCalled to his side, his brothers wept to trace  \nThe marks of anguish in his altered face.  \nNo longer bright and glorious as of old.  \nHe thus addressed them when the tale was told:  \n\'Alas! my brothers, that my life should blot  \nThe fame of those the Sun himself begot:  \nAs from the labouring cloud the driven rain  \nLeaves on the mirror\'s polished face a stain.  \nE\'en as an elephant who loathes the stake  \nAnd the strong chain he has no power to break,  \nI cannot brook this cry on every side,  \nThat spreads like oil upon the moving tide.  \nI leave the daughter of Videha\'s King,  \nAnd the fair blossom soon from her to spring,  \n\np. 530  \n\nAs erst, obedient to my sire\'s command,  \nI left the empire of the sea-girt land.  \nGood is my queen, and spotless; but the blame  \nIs hard to bear, the mockery and the shame.  \nMen blame the pure Moon for the darkened ray.  \nWhen the black shadow takes the light away  \nAnd, O my brothers, if ye wish to see  \nRama live long from this reproach set free,  \nLet not your pity labour to control  \nThe firm sad purpose of his changeless soul.\'  \n\nThus Rama spake. The sorrowing brothers beard  \nHis stern resolve, without an answering word;  \nFor none among them dared his voice to raise,  \nThat will to question:--and they could not praise.  \n\'Beloved brother,\' thus the monarch cried  \nTo his dear Lakshman, whom he called aside.--  \nLakshman, who knew no will save his alone  \nWhose hero deeds through all the world were known:--  \n\'My queen has told me that s*he longs to rove  \nBeneath the shade of Saint Valmiki\'s grove:  \nNow mount thy car, away my lady bear;  \nTell all, and leave her in the forest there.\'  \n\nThe car was brought, the gentle lady smiled,  \nAs the glad news her trusting heart beguiled.  \nShe mounted up: Sumantra held the reins;  \nAnd forth the coursers bounded o\'er the plains.  \nShe saw green fields in all their beauty dressed,  \nAnd thanked her husband in her loving breast.  \nAlas! deluded queen! she little knew  \nHow changed was he whom she believed so true;  \nHow one she worshipped like the Heavenly Tree  \nCould, in a moment\'s time, so deadly be.  \nHer right eye throbbed,--ill-omened sign, to tell  \nThe endless loss of him she loved so well,  \nAnd to the lady\'s saddening heart revealed  \nThe woe that Lakshman, in his love, concealed.  \nPale grew the bloom of her sweet face,--as fade  \nThe lotus blossoms,--by that sign dismayed.  \n\'Oh. may this omen,\'--was her silent prayer,--  \n\'No grief to Rama or his brothers bear I\'  \n\nWhen Lakshman, faithful to his brother, stood  \nPrepared to leave her in the distant wood,  \nThe holy Ganga, flowing by the way,  \nRaised all her hands of waves to bid him stay.  \nAt length with sobs and burning tears that rolled  \nDown his sad face, the king\'s command he told;  \nAs when a monstrous cloud, in evil hour,  \n\np. 531  \n\nRains from its labouring womb a stony shower.  \nShe heard, she swooned, she fell upon the earth,  \nFell on that bosom whence she sprang to birth.  \nAs, when the tempest in its fury flies,  \nLow in the dust the prostrate creeper lies,  \nSo, struck with terror sank she on the ground,  \nAnd all her gems, like flowers, lay scattered round.  \nBut Earth, her mother, closed her stony breast.  \nAnd, filled with doubt, denied her daughter rest.  \nShe would not think the Chief of Raghu\'s race  \nWould thus his own dear guiltless wife disgrace.  \nStunned and unconscious, long the lady lay,  \nAnd felt no grief, her senses all astray.  \nBut gentle Lakshman, with a brother\'s care,  \nBrought back her sense, and with her sense, despair.  \nBut not her wrongs, her shame, her grief, could wring  \nOne angry word against her lord the King:  \nUpon herself alone the blame she laid.  \nFor tears and sighs that would not yet be stayed.  \nTo soothe her anguish Lakshman gently strove;  \nHe showed the path to Saint Valmiki\'s grove;  \nAnd craved her pardon for the share of ill  \nHe wrought, obedient to his brother\'s will.  \n\'O, long and happy, dearest brother, live!  \nI have to praise\', she cried,\' and not forgive:  \nTo do his will should be thy noblest praise;  \nAs Vishn\'u ever Indra\'s will obeys.  \nReturn, dear brother: on each royal dame  \nBestow a blessing in poor Sita\'s name,  \nAnd bid them, in their love, kind pity take  \nUpon her offspring, for the father\'s sake.  \nAnd speak my message in the monarch\'s ear,  \nThe last last words of mine that he shall hear:  \n\'Say, was it worthy of thy noble race  \nThy guiltless queen thus lightly to disgrace?  \nFor idle tales to spurn thy faithful bride,  \nWhose constant truth the searching fire had tried?  \nOr may I hope thy soul refused consent,  \nAnd but thy voice decreed my banishment?  \nHope that no care could turn, no love could stay  \nThe lightning stroke that falls on me to-day?  \nThat sins committed in the life that\'s fled  \nHave brought this evil on my guilty head?  \nThink not I value now my widowed life,  \nWorthless to her who once was Rama\'s wife.  \nI only live because I hope to see  \nThe dear dear babe that will resemble thee.  \nAnd then my task of penance shall be done,  \n\np. 532  \n\nWith eyes uplifted to the scorching sun;  \nSo shall the life that is to come restore  \nMine own dear husband, to be lost no more.\'  \nAnd Lakshman swore her every word to tell,  \nThen turned to go, and bade the queen farewell.  \nAlone with all her woes, her piteous cries  \nRose like a butchered lamb\'s that struggling dies.  \nThe reverend sage who from his dwelling came  \nFor sacred grass and wood to feed the flame,  \nHeard her loud shrieks that rent the echoing wood,  \nAnd, quickly following, by the mourner stood.  \nBefore the sage the lady bent her low,  \nDried her poor eyes, and strove to calm her woe.  \nWith blessings on her hopes the blameless man  \nIn silver tones his soothing speech began:  \n\'First of all faithful wives, O Queen, art thou;  \nAnd can I fail to mourn thy sorrows now?  \nRest in this holy grove, nor harbour fear  \nWhere dwell in safety e\'en the timid deer.  \nHere shall thine offspring safely see the light,  \nAnd be partaker of each holy rite.  \nHere, near the hermits\' dwellings, shall thou lave  \nThy limbs in *Tonse\'s* sin-destroying wave,  \nAnd on her isles, by prayer and worship, gain  \nSweet peace of mind, and rest from care and pain.  \nEach hermit maiden with her sweet soft voice,  \nShall soothe thy woe, and bid thy heart rejoice:  \nWith fruit and early flowers thy lap shall fill,  \nAnd offer grain that springs for us at will.  \nAnd here, with labour light, thy task shall be  \nTo water carefully each tender tree,  \nAnd learn how sweet a nursing mother\'s joy  \nEre on thy bosom rest thy darling boy.\'  \n\nThat very night the banished Sita bare  \nTwo royal children, most divinely fair.  \n\nThe saint Valmiki, with a friend\'s delight,  \nGraced Sita\'s offspring with each holy rite.  \nKus\'a and Lava--such the names they bore--  \nLearnt, e\'en in childhood, all the Vedas\' lore;  \nAnd then the bard, their minstrel souls to train,  \nTaught them to sing his own immortal strain.  \nAnd Rama\'s deeds her boys so sweetly sang,  \nThat Sita\'s breast forgot her bitterest pang.  \n\np. 533  \n\n   Then Sita\'s children, by the saint\'s command,  \n   Sang the Ramayan, wandering through the land.  \n   How could the glorious poem fail to gain  \n   Each heart, each ear that listened to the strain!  \n   So sweet each minstrel\'s voice who sang the praise  \n   Of Rama deathless in Valmiki\'s lays.  \n   Rama himself amid the wondering throng  \n   Marked their fair forms, and loved the noble song,  \n   While, still and weeping, round the nobles stood,  \n   As, on a windless morn, a dewy wood.  \n   On the two minstrels all the people gazed,  \n   Praised their fair looks and marvelled as they praised;  \n   For every eye amid the throng could trace  \n   Rama\'s own image in each youthful face.  \n   Then spoke the king himself and bade them say  \n   Who was their teacher, whose the wondrous lay.  \n   Soon as Valmiki, mighty saint, he saw,  \n   He bowed his head in reverential awe.  \n   \'These are thy children\' cried the saint,\'recall  \n   Thine own dear Sita, pure and true through all.  \n   \'O holy father,\' thus the king replied,  \n   \'The faithful lady by the fire was tried;  \n   But the foul demon\'s too successful arts  \n   Raised light suspicions in my people\'s hearts.  \n   Grant that their breasts may doubt her faith no more,  \n   And thus my Sita and her sons restore.\'  \n\n             _Raghuvans\'a Cantos XIV, XV._  \n\nPARAS\'UR\xc3\x81MA, PAGE 87.\n\n\'He cleared the earth thrice seven times of the Kshatriya caste, and filled\nwith their blood the five large lakes of Samanta, from which he offered\nlibations to the race of Bhrigu. Offering a solemn sacrifice to the King of\nthe Gods Paras\'urama presented the earth to the ministering priests. Having\ngiven the earth to Kas\'vapa, the hero of immeasurable prowess retired to the\nMahendra mountain, where he still resides; and in this manner was there enmity\nbetween him and the race of the Kshatriyas, and thus was the whole earth\nconquered by Paras\'urama.\' The destruction of the Kshatriyas by Paras\'urama\nhad been provoked by the cruelty of the Kshatriyas. _Chips from a German\nWorkshop_ , Vol. II. p.334.\n\nThe scene in which he appears is probably interpolated for the sake of making\nhim declare Rama to be Vishnu. \'Herr von Schlegel has often remarked to me,\'\nsays Lassen,\'that without injuring the connexion of the story all the chapters\n[of the Ramayan} might be omitted in which Rama is regarded as an incarnation\nof Vishn\'u. In fact, where the incarnation of Vishn\'u as the four sons of\nDas\'aratha is described, the great sacrifice is already ended, and all the\npriests remunerated at the termination, when the new sacrifice begins at which\nthe Gods appear, then withdraw, and then first propose the incarnation to\nVishnu,\n\np. 534\n\nIf it had been an original circumstance of the story, the Gods would certainly\nhave deliberated on the matter earlier, and the celebration of the sacrifice\nwould have continued without interruption.\' LASSEN, _Indische Alterthumskunde,\nVol. I._ p.489.\n\nYAMA, PAGE 68.\n\nSon of Vivasvat=Jima son of Vivanghvat, the Jamahid of the later Persians.\n\nFATE PAGE 68.\n\n\'The idea of fate was different in India from that which prevailed in Greece.\nIn Greece fate was a mysterious, inexorable power which governed men and human\nevents, and from which it was impossible to escape. In India Fate was rather\nan inevitable consequence of actions done in births antecedent to one\'s\npresent state of existence, and was therefore connected with the doctrine of\nmetempsychosis. A misfortune was for the most part a punishment, an expiation\nof ancient faults not yet entirely cancelled.\' GORRESIO.\n\nVIS\'V\xc3\x81MITRA.

The Brahmans cannot deny the fact, because it forms one of\nthe principal subjects of their legendary poems. But they have spared no pains\nto represent the exertions of Vis\'vamitra, in his struggle for Brahmanhood, as\nso superhuman that no one would easily be tempted to follow his example. No\nmention is made of these monstrous penances in the Veda, where the struggle\nbetween Vis\'vamitra, the leader of the Kus\'ikas or Bharatas, and the Brahman\nVas\'ishtha, the leader of the white-robed Tritsus, is represented as the\nstruggle of two rivals for the place of Purohita or chief priest and minister\nat the court of King Sudas, the son of Pijavana.\' _Chips from a German\nWorkshop, Vol. II._ p.336.\n\nHOUSEHOLD GODS, PAGE 102.\n\n\'No house is supposed to be without its tutelary divinity, but the notion\nattached to this character is now very far from precise. The deity who is the\nobject of hereditary and family worship, the _Kuladev ata_, is always one of\nthe leading personages of the Hindu mythology, as S\'iva, Vishnu or Durga, but\nthe _Grihadevat a_ rarely bears any distinct appellation. In Bengal, the\ndomestic god is sometimes the _S abagram_ stone, sometimes the _tulasi_ plant,\nsometimes a basket with a little rice in it, and sometimes a water-jar--to\neither of which a brief adoration is daily addressed, most usually by the\nfemales of the family. Occasionally small images of Lakshmi or Chandi fulfil\nthe office, or should a snake appear, he is venerated as the guardian of the\ndwelling. In general, however, in former times, the household deities were\nregarded as the unseen spirits of ill, the ghosts and goblins who hovered\nabout every spot, and claimed some particular sites as their own.

Neither\nceremony is described in these poems\n\np. 537\n\nwith the full detail which is given of the vaidik rite in the _Aitareya-Br\nahmanam_; but the allusion that Rama was inaugurated by _Vasishtha_ and the\nother Brahmanas in the same manner as Indra by the Vasus...and the observation\nwhich is made in some passages that a certain rite of the inauguration was\nperformed \'according to the sacred rule\'...admit of the conclusion that the\nceremony was supposed to have taken place in conformity with the vaidik\ninjunction.... As the inauguration of _R ama_ was intended and the necessary\npreparations for it were made when his father Das\'aratha was still alive, but\nas the ceremony itself, through the intrigues of his step-mother _Kaikey i_,\ndid not take place then, but fourteen years later, after the death of\n_Das\'aratha_ , an account of the preparatory ceremonies is given in the\n_Ayodhy akanda_ (Book II) as well as in the _Yuddha-K anda_ (Book VI.) of the\nRamayana, but an account of the complete ceremony in the latter book alone.\nAccording to the _Ayodhy akanda_, on the day preceding the intended\ninauguration _R ama_ and his wife _S ita_ held a fast, and in the night they\nperformed this preliminary rite: _R ama_ having made his ablutions, approached\nthe idol of _N arayana_, took a cup of clarified butter, as the religious law\nprescribes, made a libation of it into the kindled fire, and drank the\nremainder while wishing what was agreeable to his heart. Then, with his mind\nfixed on the divinity he lay, silent and composed, together with _S ita_, on a\nbed of Kus\'a-grass, which was spread before the altar of Vishnu, until the\nlast watch of the night, when he awoke and ordered the palace to be prepared\nfor the solemnity. At day-break reminded of the time by the voices of the\nbards, he performed the usual morning devotion and praised the divinity. In\nthe meantime the town Ayodhya had assumed a festive appearance and the\ninauguration implements had been arranged...golden water-jars, an ornamented\nthrone-seat, a chariot covered with a splendid tiger-skin, water taken from\nthe confluence of the Ganges and Jumna, as well as from other sacred rivers,\ntanks, wells, lakes, and from all oceans, honey, curd, clarified butter, fried\ngrain, Kus\'a-grass, flowers, milk; besides, eight beautiful damsels, and a\nsplendid furious elephant, golden and silver jars, filled with water, covered\nwith _Udumbara_ branches and various lotus flowers, besides a white jewelled\n_chourie_ , a white splendid parasol, a white bull, a white horse, all manner\nof musical instruments and bards....In the preceding chapter...there are\nmentioned _two_ white _chouries_ instead of one, and all kinds of seeds,\nperfumes and jewels, a scimitar, a bow, a litter, a golden vase, and a blazing\nfire, and amongst the living implements of the pageant, instead of the bards,\ngaudy courtesans, and besides the eight damsels, professors of divinity,\nBrahmanas, cows and pure kinds of wild beasts and birds, the chiefs of town\nand country-people and the citizens with their train.\'\n\nPAGE 109.\n\n  \n   _Then with the royal chaplains they  \n   Took each his place *in* long array.  \n   The twice born chiefs, with zealous heed,  \n   Made ready what the rite would need._  \n\n\'Now about the office of a Purohita (house priest).

In the\nhymns of the Veda Vritra appears to be the thick dark cloud which Indra the\nGod of the firmament attacks and disperses with his thunderbolt.\' GORRESIO.\n\n\'In that class of Rig-veda hymns which there is reason to look upon as the\noldest portion of Vedic poetry, the character of Indra is that of a mighty\nruler of the firmament, and his principal feat is that of conquering the demon\n_Vritra_ , a symbolical personification of the cloud which obstructs the\nclearness of the sky, and withholds the fructifying rain from the earth. In\nhis battles with Vritra he is therefore described as \'opening the receptacles\nof the waters,\' as \'cleaving the cloud\' with his \'far-whirling thunderbolt,\'\nas \'casting the waters down to earth.\' and \'restoring the sun to the sky.\' He\nis in consequence \'the upholder of heaven, earth, and firmament,\' and the god\n\'who has engendered the sun and the dawn.\' CHAMBERS\'S CYCLOP\xc3\x86DIA, _lndra_.\n\n\'Throughout these hymns two images stand out before us with overpowering\ndistinctness. On one side is the bright god of the heaven, as beneficent as he\nis irresistible: on the other the demon of night and of darkness, as false and\ntreachorous as he is malignant... The latter (as his name Vritra, from var, to\nveil, indicates) is pre-eminently the thief who hides away the rain-clouds...\nBut the myth is yet in too early a state to allow of the definite designations\nwhich are brought before us in the conflicts of Zeus with Typhon and his\nmonstrous progeny, of Apollon with the Python, of Bellerophon with Chimaira of\nOidipous with the Sphinx, of Hercules with Cacus, of Sigurd with the dragon\nFafnir; and thus not only is Vritra known by many names, but he is opposed\nsometimes by Indra, sometimes by Agni the fire-god, sometimes by Trita,\nBrihaspati, or other deities; or rather these are all names of one and the\nsame god:  \n\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xbb\xce\xbb\xcf\x8e\xce\xbd \xe1\xbd\x80\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xce\xac\xcf\x84\xcf\x89\xce\xbd \xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xcf\x81\xcf\x86\xe1\xbd\xb4 \xce\xbc\xce\xaf\xce\xb1.  \n\nCox\'s _Mythology of the Aryan Nations.

Chap. 15. \'Afterwards the Munis beheld a great dust\narise, and they said to the people who were nigh: "What is this?" And the\npeople answered and said: "Now that the kingdom is without a king, the\ndishonest men have begun to seize the property of their neighbours. The great\ndust that you behold, excellent Munis, is raised by troops of clustering\nrobbers, hastening to fall upon their prey." The sages, hearing this,\nconsulted, and together rubbed the thigh of the king (Vena), who had left no\noffspring, to produce a son. From the thigh, thus rubbed, came forth a being\nof the complexion of a charred stake, with flattened features like a negro,\nand of dwarfish stature. "What am I to do," cried he eagerly to the Munis.\n"Sit down (nishida)," said they. And thence his name was Nishada. His\ndescendants, the inhabitants of the Vindhya mountain, great Muni, are still\ncalled Nishadas and are characterized by the exterior tokens of depravity.\'\nProfessor Wilson adds, in his note on the passage: \'The Matsya says that there\nwere born outcast or barbarous races, Mlechchhas, as black as collyrium. The\nBhagavata describes an individual of dwarfish stature, with short arms and\nlegs, of a complexion as black as a crow, with projecting chin, broad flat\nnose, red eyes, and tawny hair, whose descendants were mountaineers and\nforesters. The Padma (Bhumi Khanda) has a similar deccription; adding to the\ndwarfish stature and black complexion, a wide mouth, large ears, and a\nprotuberant belly. It also particularizes his posterity as Nishadas, Kiratas,\nBhillas, and other barbarians and Mlechchhas, living in woods and on\nmountains. These passages intend, and do not much exaggerate, the uncouth\nappearance of the Gonds, Koles, Bhils, and other uncivilized tribes, scattered\nalong the forests and mountains of Central India from Behar to Khandesh, and\nwho are, not improbably, the predecessors of the present occupants of the\ncultivated portions of the country. They are always very black, ill-shapen,\nand dwarfish, and have countenances of a very African character.\'\n\np. 540\n\nManu gives a different origin of the Nishadas as the offspring of a Brahman\nfather and a Sudra mother.

The poem\nis therefore in accordance with the Code regarding the peculiar guilt of\nkilling Brahmans; but in allowing a hermit who was not a _Divija_ (twice-born)\nto go to heaven, the poem is far in advance of the Code. The youth in the poem\nis allowed to read the Veda, and to accumulate merit by his own as well as his\nfathers pious acts; whereas the exclusive Code reserves all such privileges to\n_Divijas_ , invested with the sacred cord.\' Mrs. SPEIR\'S _Life in Ancient\nIndia,_ p. 107.\n\nPAGE 174.\n\nTHE PRAISE OF KINGS.\n\n\'Compare this magnificent eulogium of kings and kingly government with what\nSamuel says of the king and his authority: And Samuel told all the words of\nthe LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.\n\nAnd he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He\nwill take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be\nhis horsemen: and some shall run before his chariots.\n\np. 541\n\n     And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties, and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instrument of war, and instruments of his chariots. \n\n     And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. \n\n     And he will take your fields, and your vineyards and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. \n\n     And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. \n\n     And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.

That taken\nby the envoys appears to have been the shorter one, and we are not told why\nBharath returned by a different road. The capital of the Kekeyas lay to the\nwest of the Vipas\'a. Between it and the S\'atadru stretched the country of the\nBahikas. Upon the remaining portion of the road the two recensions differ.\nAccording to that of Bengal there follow towards the east the river Indamati,\nthen the town Ajakala belonging to the Bodhi, then Bhulinga, then the river\nS\'aradanda. According to the other instead of the first river comes the\nIkshumati...instead of the first town Abhikala, instead of the second Kulinga,\nthen the second river. According to the direction of the route both the above-\nmentioned rivers must be tributaries of the S\'atadru...The road then crossed\nthe Yamnuna (Jumna), led beyond that river through the country of the\nPanchalas, and reached the Ganges at Hastinapura, where the ferry was. Thence\nit led over the Ramaganga and its eastern tributaries, then over the Gomati,\nand then in a southern direction along the Malini, beyond which it reached\nAyodhya*. In Bharath\'s journey the following rivers are passed from west to\neast: _Kutikeshtik a_, _Utt anika_, _Kutik a_, _Kap ivati_, _Gomat i_\naccording to Schlegel, and _Hiranyairat i_, _Utt arika_, _Kvtil a_, _Kapivati_\n, _Gomat i_ according to Gorresio. As these rivers are to be looked for on the\neast of the Ganges, the first must be the modern _K*oh_ , a small affluent of\nthe Ramaganga, over which the highway cannot have gone as it bends too far to\nthe north. The Uttanika or Uttarika must be the Ramaganga,the Kutika or Kutila\nits eastern tributary Kos\'ila, the Kapivati the next tributary which on the\nmaps has different names, _Gurra_ or above Kailas,\n\np. 542\n\nlower down _Bhaigu_.

At the same time, however, the story\nthrows some light upon the significance of the poem, and upon the character in\nwhich the Brahmanical author desired to represent Rama; and consequently it\ndeserves more serious consideration than the nature of the subject-matter\nwould otherwise seem to imply.\n\nAccording to the Ramayana, the hero Rama spent more than thirteen years of his\nexile in wandering amongst the different Brahmanical settlements, which appear\nto have been scattered over the country between the Ganges and the Godaveri;\nhis wanderings extending from the hill of Chitra-kuta in Bundelkund, to the\nmodern town of Nasik on the western side of India, near the source of the\nGodaveri river, and about seventy-five miles to the north-west of Bombay. The\nappearance of these Brahmanical hermitages in the country far away to the\nsouth of the Raj of Kasala, seems to call for critical inquiry. Each hermitage\nis said to have belonged to some particular sage, who is famous in Brahmanical\ntradition. But whether the sages named were really contemporaries of Rama, or\nwhether they could possibly have flourished at one and the same period, is\nopen to serious question. It is of course impossible to fix with any degree of\ncertainty the relative chronology of the several sages, who are said to have\nbeen visited by Rama; but still it seems tolerably clear that some belonged to\nan age far anterior to that in which the Ramayana was composed, and probably\nto an age anterior to that in which Rama existed as a real and living\npersonage; whilst, at least, one sage is to be found who could only have\nexisted in the age during which the Ramayana was produced in its present form.\nThe main proofs of these inferences are as follows. An interval of many\ncenturies seems to have elapsed between the composition of the Rig-Veda and\nthat of the Ramayana: a conclusion\n\np. 544\n\nwhich has long been proved by the evidence of language, and is generally\naccepted by Sanskrit scholars. But three of the sages, said to have been\ncontemporary with Rama, namely, Vis\'vamitra, Atri and Agastya, are frequently\nmentioned in the hymns of the Rig-Veda; whilst Valmiki, the sage dwelling at\nChitra-kuta, is said to have been himself the composer of the Ramayana. Again,\nthe sage Atri, whom Rama visited immediately after his departure from Chitra-\nkuta, appears in the genealogical list preserved in the Maha Bharata, as the\nprogenitor of the Moon, and consequently as the first ancestor of the Lunar\nrace: whilst his grandson Buddha [Budha} is said to have married Ila, the\ndaughter of Ikhs\'vaku who was himself the remote ancestor of the Solar race of\nAyodhya, from whom Rama was removed by many generations. These conclusions are\nnot perhaps based upon absolute proof, because they are drawn from\nuntrustworthy authorities; but still the chronological difficulties have been\nfully apprehended by the Pundits, and an attempt has been made to reconcile\nall contradictions by representing the sages to have lived thousands of years,\nand to have often re-appeared upon earth in different ages widely removed from\neach other. Modern science refuses to accept such explanations; and\nconsequently it is impossible to escape the conclusion that if Valmiki\ncomposed the Ramayana in the form of Sanskrit in which it has been preserved,\nhe could not have flourished in the same age as the sages who are named in the\nRig-Veda."

Urvasi is the bright flush of light overspreading the\nheaven before the sun rises, and is but another form of the many mythical\nbeings of Greek mythology whose names take us back to the same idea or the\nsame root. As the dawn in the Vedic hymns is called Uruki, the far-going\n(Telephassa, Telephos), so is she also Uruasi, the wide-existing or wide-\nspreading; as are Europe, Euryanassa, Euryphassa, and many more of the sisters\nof Athene and Aphrodite. As such she is the mother of Vasishtha, the bright\nbeing, as Oidipous is the son of Iokaste; and although Vasishtha, like\nOidipous, has become a mortal bard or sage, he is still the son of Mitra and\nVaruna, of night and day. Her lover Pururavas is the counterpart of the\nHellenic Polydeukes; but the continuance of her union with him depends on the\ncondition that she never sees him unclothed. But the Gandharvas, impatient of\nher long sojourn among mortal men resolved to bring her back to their bright\nhome; and Pururavas is thus led unwitingly to disregard her warning. A ewe\nwith two lambs was tied to her couch, and the Gandharvas stole one of them;\nUrvasi said, "They take away my darling, as if I lived in a land where there\nis no hero and no man." They stole the second, and she upbraided her husband\nagain. Then Pururavas looked and said, "How can that be a land without heroes\nor men where I am?" And naked he sprang up; he thought it was too long to put\non his dress. Then the Gandharvas sent a flash of lighting, and Urvasi saw her\nhusband naked as by daylight. Then she vanished. "I come back," she said, and\nwent. \'Then he bewailed his vanished love in bitter grief.\' Her promise to\nreturn was fulfilled, but for a moment only, at the Lotos-lake, and Pururavas\nin vain beseeches her to tarry longer. \'What shall I do with thy\n\np. 547\n\nspeech?\' is the answer of Urvasi. \'I am gone like the first of the dawns.\nPururavas, go home again. I am hard to be caught like the winds.\' Her lover is\nin utter despair; but when he lies down to die, the heart of Urvasi was\nmelted, and she bids him come to her on the last night of the year. On that\nnight only he might be with her; but a son should be born to him. On that day\nhe went up to the golden seats, and there Urvasi told him that the Gandharvas\nwould grant him one wish, and that he must make his choice. \'Choose thou for\nme,\' he said: and she answered, \'Say to them, Let me be one of you.\'\n\nCox\'s _Mythology of the Aryan Nations_.

He implicitly believes that Rama is Vishnu,\nwho became incarnate for the purpose of destroying the demon Ravana: that he\npermitted his wife to be captured by Ravana for the sake of delivering the\ngods and Brahmans from the oppressions of the Rakshasa; and that he ultimately\nassembled an army of monkeys, who were the progeny of the gods, and led them\nagainst the strong-hold of Ravana at Lanka, and delivered the world from the\ntyrant Rakshasa, whilst obtaining ample revenge for his own personal wrongs.\n\np. 548\n\nOne other point seems to demand consideration, namely, the possibility of such\nan alliance as that which Rama is said to have concluded with the monkeys.\nThis possibility will of course be denied by modern critics, but still it is\ninteresting to trace out the circumstances which seem to have led to the\nacceptance, of such a wild belief by the dreamy and marvel loving Hindi. The\nsouth of India swarms with monkeys of curious intelligence and rare physical\npowers. Their wonderful instinct for organization, their attachment to\nparticular localities, their occasional journeys in large numbers over\nmountains and across rivers, their obstinate assertion of supposed rights, and\nthe ridiculous caricature which they exhibit of all that is animal and\nemotional in man, would naturally create a deep impression.... Indeed the\nhabits of monkeys well deserve to be patiently studied; not as they appear in\nconfinement, when much that is revolting in their nature is developed, but as\nthey appear living in freedom amongst the trees of the forest, or in the\nstreets of crowded cities, or precincts of temples. Such a study would not\nfail to awaken strange ideas; and although the European would not be prepared\nto regard monkeys as sacred animals he might be led to speculate as to their\norigin by the light of data, which are at present unknown to the naturalist\nwhose observations have been derived from the menagerie alone.\n\nWhatever, however, may have been the train of ideas which led the Hindu to\nregard the monkey as a being half human and half divine, there can be little\ndoubt that in the Ramayana the monkeys of southern India have been confounded\nwith what may be called the aboriginal people of the country. The origin of\nthis confusion may be easily conjectured. Perchance the aborigines of the\ncountry may have been regarded as a superior kind of monkeys; and to this day\nthe features of the Marawars, who are supposed to be the aborigines of the\nsouthern part of the Carnatic, are not only different from those of their\nneighbours, but are of a character calculated to confirm the conjecture.\nAgain, it is probable that the army of aborigines may have been accompanied by\noutlying bands of monkeys impelled by that magpie-like curiosity and love of\nplunder which are the peculiar characteristics of the monkey race; and this\nincident may have given rise to the story that the army was composed of\nMonkeys."

Vol. II. pp._ 316 _ff._\n\nTHE FALL OF B\xc3\x81LI, PAGE 342.\n\n"As regards the narrative, it certainly seems to refer to some real event\namongst the aboriginal tribes: namely, the quarrel between an elder and\nyounger brother for the possession of a Raj; and the subsequent alliance of\nRama with the younger brother. It is somewhat remarkable that Rama appears to\nhave formed an alliance with the wrong party, for the right of Bali was\nevidently superior to that of Sugriva; and it is especially worthy of note\nthat Rama compassed the death of Bali by an act contrary to all the laws of\nfair fighting. Again, Rama seems to have tacitly sanctioned the transfer of\nTara from Bali to Sugriva, which was directly opposed to modern rule, although\nin conformity with the rude customs of a barbarous age; and it is remarkable\nthat to this day the marriage of both widows and divorced women is practised\nby the Marawars, or aborigines of the southern Carnatic, contrary to the\ndeeply-rooted prejudice which exists against such unions amongst the Hindus at\nlarge." WHEELER\'S _History of India, Vol. II._ 324\\.\n\np. 549\n\nTHE V\xc3\x81NAR HOST, PAGE 370.\n\n"The splendid Marutas form the army of Indras, the red-haired monkeys and\nbears that of Ramas; and the mythical and solar nature of the monkeys and\nbears of the Ramayanam manifests itself several times. The king of the monkeys\nis a sun-god. Thc ancient king was named Balin, and was the son of Indras. His\nyounger brother Sugrivas, he who changes his shape at pleasure (Kamarupas),\nwho, helped by Ramas, usurped his throne, is said to be own child of the sun.\nHere it is evident that the Vedic antagonism between Indras and Vishnus is\nreproduced in a zoological and entirely apish form. The old Zeus must give way\nto the new, the moon to the sun, the evening to the morning sun, the sun of\nwinter to that of spring; the young son betrays and overthrows the old one....\nRamas, who treacherously kills the old king of the monkeys, Balin, is the\nequivalent of Vishnus, who hurls his predecessor Indras from his throne; and\nSugrivas, the new king of the monkeys resembles Indras when he promises to\nfind the ravished Sita, in the same way as Vishnus in one of his incarnations\nfinds again the lost vedas. And there are other indications in the Ramayanam\nof opposition between Indras and the monkeys who assist Ramas. The great\nmonkey Hanumant, of the reddish colour of gold, has his jaw broken, Indras\nhaving struck him with his thunderbolt and caused him to fall upon a mountain,\nbecause, while yet a child, he threw himself off a mountain into the air in\norder to arrest the course of the sun, whose rays had no effect upon him. (The\ncloud rises from the mountain and hides the sun, which is unable of itself to\ndisperse it; the tempest comes, and brings flashes of lightning and thunder-\nbolts, which tear the cloud in pieces.)\n\nThe whole legend of the monkey Hanumant represents the sun entering into the\ncloud or darkness, and coming out of it. His father is said to be now the\nwind, now the elephant of the monkeys (Kapikunjaras), now Kes\'arin, the long-\nhaired sun, the sun with a mane, the lion sun (whence his name of _Kes\'arinak\nputrah_ ). From this point of view, Hanumant would seem to be the brother of\nSugrivas, who is also the offspring of the sun....\n\nAll the epic monkeys of the _R amayanam_ are described in the twentieth canto\nof the first book by expressions which very closely resemble those applied in\nthe Vedic hymns to the Marutas, as swift as the tempestuous wind, changing\ntheir shape at pleasure, making a noise like clouds, sounding like thunder,\nbattling, hurling mountain-peaks, shaking great uprooted trees, stirring up\nthe deep waters, crushing the earth with their arms, making the clouds fall.\nThus Balin comes out of the cavern as the sun out of the cloud....\n\nBut the legend of the monkey Hanumant presents another curious resemblance to\nthat of Samson. Hanumant is bound with cords by Indrajit, son of Ravanas; he\ncould easily free himself, but does not wish to do so. Ravanas to put him to\nshame, orders his tail to be burned, because the tail is the part most prized\nby monkeys....\n\nThe tail of Hanumant, which sets fire to the city of the monsters, is probably\na personification of the rays of the morning or spring sun, which sets fire to\nthe eastern heavens, and destroys the abode of tne nocturnal or winter\nmonsters."

The region of Hari or Vishnu belongs to the system of\nmythical geography; but the case is different with the Uttara Kurus. Here\nthere is a real basis of geographical fact; of which fable has only taken\nadvantage, without creating it. The Uttara Kurus were formerly quite\nindependent of the mythical system of _dv ipas_, though they were included in\nit at an early date." Again the same writer says at p. 65: "That the\nconception of the Uttara Kurus is based upon an actual country and not on mere\ninvention, is proved (1) by the way in which they are mentioned in the Vedas;\n(2) by the\n\np. 553\n\nexistence of Uttara Kuru in historical times as a real country; and (3) by the\nway in which the legend makes mention of that region as the home of primitive\ncustoms. To begin with the last point the Mahabharata speaks as follows of the\nfreer mode of life which women led in the early world, Book I. verses 4719-22:\n\'Women were formerly unconfined and roved about at their pleasure,\nindependent. Though in their youthful innocence they abandoned their husbands,\nthey were guilty of no offence; for such was the rule in early times. This\nancient custom is even now the law for creatures born as brutes, which are\nfree from lust and anger. This custom is supported by authority and is\nobserved by great rishia, and it is _still practiced among the northern\nKurus_.\'\n\n"The idea which is here conveyed is that of the continuance in one part of the\nworld of that original blessedness which prevailed in the golden age. To\nafford a conception of the happy condition of the southern Kurus it is said in\nanother place M.-Bh, i. 4346. "The southern Kurus vied in happiness with the\nnorthern Kurus and with the divine rishis and bards."\n\nProfessor Lassen goes on to say: "Ptolemy (vi. 16.) is also acquainted with\n_Uttara Kuru_. He speaks of a mountain, a people, and a city called\n_Ottorakorra_. Most of the other ancient authors who elsewhere mention this\nname, have it from him. It is a part of the country which he calls Serica;\naccording to him the city lies twelve degrees west from the metropolis of\nSera, and the mountain extends from thence far to the eastward. As Ptolemy has\nmisplaeed the whole of eastern Asia beyond the Ganges, the relative position\nwhich he assigns will guide us better that the absolute one, which removes\nOitorakorra so far to the east that a correction is inevitable. According to\nmy opinion the Ottorakorra of Ptolemy must be sought for to the east of\nKashgar." Lassen also thinks that Magasthenes had the Uttara Kurus in view\nwhen he referred to the Hyperboreans who were fabled by Indian writers to live\na thousand years. In his Indian antiquities, (Ind. Alterthumskunde, i. 511,\n512. and note,) the same writer concludes that though the passages above cited\nrelative to the Uttara Kurus indicate a belief in the existence of a really\nexisting country of that name in the far north, yet that the descriptions\nthere given are to be taken as pictures of an ideal paradise, and not as\nfounded on any recollections of the northern origin of the Kurus. It is\nprobable, he thinks, that some such reminiscences originally existed, and\nstill survived in the Vedic era, though there is no trace of their existence\nin latter times."

GORRESIO.\n\nThe following is the literal translation of the Canto, text and commentary,\nfrom the Calcutta edition:\n\nHaving found Rama weary with fighting and buried in deep thought, and Ravan\nstanding before him ready to engage in battle, the holy Agastya, who had come\nto see the battle, approached Rama and spoke to him thus: "O mighty Rama,\nlisten to the old mystery by which thou wilt conquer all thy foes in the\nbattle. Having daily repeated the \xc3\x81dityahridaya (the delighter of the mind of\nthe Sun) the holy prayer which destroys all enemies (of him who repeats it)\ngives victory, removes all sins, sorrows and distress, increases life, and\nwhich is the blessing of all blessings, worship the rising and splendid sun\nwho is respected by both the Gods and demons, who gives light to all bodies\nand who is the rich lord of all the worlds, (To the question why this prayer\nclaims so great reverence; the sage answers) Since yonder * sun is full of\nglory and all gods reside in him (he being their material cause) and bestows\nbeing and the active principle on all creatures by his rays; and since he\nprotects all deities, demons and men with his rays.\n\nHe is Brahma, 1 Vishnu, 2 Siva, 3 Skanda, 4 Prajapati, 5 Mahendra, 6 Dhanada,\n7 Kala, 8 Yama, 9 Soma, 10 Apam Pati _i.e._ The lord of waters, Pitris, 11\nVasus, 12\n\np. 557\n\nSadhyas, 1 Asvins, 2 Maruts, 3 Manu, 4 Vayu, 5 Vahni, 6 Praja, 7 Prana, 8\nRitukarta, 9 Prabhakara, 10 (Thou, 11 art) Aditya, 12 Savita, 13 Surya, 14\nKhaga, 15 Pushan, 16 Gabhastiman, 17 Suvarnasadris\'a, 18 Bhanu, 19\nHiranyaretas, 20 Divakara, 21 Haridas\'va, 22 Sahasrarchish, 23 Saptasapti, 24\nMarichiman, 25 Timironmathana, 26 Sambhu, 27 Twashta, 28 Martanda, 29\nAns\'uman, 30 Hiranyagarbha, 31 Sis\'ira, 32 Tapana, 33 Ahaskara, 34 Ravi, 35\nAgnigarbha, 36 Aditiputra, 37 Sankha, 38 Sis\'iranas\'ana, 39 Vyomanatha, 40\nTamobhedi, 41 Rigyajussamaparaga, 42 Ghana-*\n\np. 558\n\nvrishti. 1 Apam-Mitra, 2 Vindhyavithiplavangama, 3 A\'tapi, 4 Mandali, 5 Mrityu\n(death), Pingala, 6 Sarvatapana, 7 Kavi, 8 Vis\'va, 9 Mahatejas, 10 Rakta, 11\nSarvabhavodbhava. 12 The Lord of stars, planets, and other luminous bodies,\nVis\'vabhavana, 13 Tejasvinam-Tejasvi, 14 Dwadas\'atman: 15 I salute thee, I\nsalute thee who art the eastern mountain.

The glorious Rama\nhaving heard this became free from sorrow. Raghava whose senses were under\ncontrol, being pleased, committed the hymn to memory, recited it facing the\nsun, and obtained great delight. The brave Rama having sipped water thrice and\nbecome pure took his bow, and seeing Ravana, was delighted, and meditated on\nthe sun.\n\nPAGE 490.\n\n  \n   _His horses poured their burning tears._  \n\nI have omitted the Canto from which this line is taken because it describes\nsigns and portents similar to those which have occurred in preceding books.\nBut the weeping of the horses is new and is too Homeric to be passed by\nunnoticed. I borrow the following extract from De Quincey: "The old Homeric\nsuperstition which connects horses by the closest sympathy, and even by\nprescience, with their masters--that superstition which Virgil has borrowed\nfrom Homer in his beautiful episode of Mezentins ( _Rhaebe diu_ , res si qua\ndiu mortalibus ulla est, Viximus)-- still lingers unbroken in Crete. Horses\nforesee the fates of riders who are doomed, and express their prescience by\nweeping in a human fashion. The horses of Achilles weep in "Iliad" xvii, on\nseeing Automedon their beloved driver prostrate on the ground. With this view\nof the horse\'s capacity, it is singular, that in Crete this animal by\npreference should be called \xcf\x84\xce\xbf \xce\xb1\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xcf\x85, the brute, or irrational creature. But\nthe word \xe1\xbc\xb1\xcf\x80\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 has, by some accident, been lost in the modern Greek.

The funeral rites are not described in detail here, and\nit is therefore difficult to elucidate and explain them. The poem assigns the\nfuneral ceremonies of Aryan Brahmans to the Rakshases, a race different from\nthem in origin and religion, in the same way as Homer sometimes introduces\ninto Troy the rites of the Grecian cult." GORRESIO.\n\nMr. Muir translates the description of the funeral from the Calcutta edition,\nas follows: "They formed, with Vedic rites, a funeral pile of faggots of\nsandal wood, with _padmaka_ wood, _us\'ira_ grass, and sandal, and covered with\na quilt of deer\'s hair. They then performed an unrivalled obsequial ceremony\nfor the Raxasa prince, placing the sacrificial ground to the S.E. and the fire\nin the proper situation. They cast the ladle filled with curds and ghee on the\nshoulder 1 of the deceased; he (?) placed the car on the feet, and the mortar\nbetween the thighs. Having deposited all the wooden vessels, the [upper] and\nlower fire-wood, and the other pestle, in their proper places, they departed.\nThe Raxasas having then slain a victim to their prince in the manner\nprescribed in the S\'astras, and enjoined by great rishis, cast [into the fire]\nthe coverlet of the king saturated with ghee. They then, Vibhishana included,\nwith afflicted hearts, adorned Ravana with perfumes and garlands, and with\nvarious vestments, and besprinkled him with fried grain. Vibhishana having\nbathed, and having, with his clothes wet, scattered in proper form _tila_\nseeds mixed with _darbha_ grass, and moistened with water, applied the fire\n[to the pile]."\n\nPAGE 496.\n\nThe following is a literal translation of Brahma\'s address to Rama according\nto the Calcutta edition, text and commentary:\n\n"O Rama, how dost thou, being the creator of all the world, best of all those\nwho have profound knowledge of the Upanishads and all-powerful as thou art,\nsuffer Sita to fall in the fire? How dost thou not know thyself as the best of\nthe gods? Thou art one of the primeval Vasus, 2 and also their lord and\ncreator. Thou art thyself the lord and first creator of the three worlds. Thou\nart the eighth (that is Mahadeva) of the Rudras, 3 and also the fifth 4 of the\nSadhyas. 5 (The poet describes Rama as made of the following gods) The\nAs\'vinikumaras (the twin divine physicians of the gods) are thy ears; the sun\nand the moon are thy eyes; and thou hast been seen in the beginning and at the\nend of creation. How dost thou neglect the daughter of Videha (Janaka like a\nman whose actions are directed by the dictates of nature?" Thus addressed by\nIndra, Brahma and\n\np. 561\n\nthe other gods, Rama the descendant of Raghu, lord of the world and the best\nof the virtuous, spoke to the chief of the gods. "As I take myself to be a man\nof the name of Rama and son of Das\'aratha, therefore, sir, please tell me who\nI am and whence have I come." "O thou whose might is never failing," said\nBrahma to Kakutstha the foremost of those who thoroughly know Brahma, "Thou\nart Narayana,  1 almighty, possessed of fortune, and armed with the discus.\nThou art the boar  2 with one tusk; the conqueror of thy past and future foes.\nThou art Brahma true and eternal or undecaying. Thou art Vis\'vaksena,  3\nhaving four arms; Thou art Hrishikes\'a,  4 whose bow is made of horn; Thou art\nPurusha,  5 the best of all beings; Thou art one who is never defeated by any\nbody; Thou art the holder of the sword (named Nandaka). Thou art Vishnu (the\npervader of all); blue in colour: of great might; the commander of armies; and\nlord of villages. Thou art truth. Thou art embodied intelligence, forgiveness,\ncontrol over the senses, creation, and destruction. Thou art Upendra  6 and\nMadhusudana. 7 Thou art the creator of Indra, the ruler over all the world,\nPadmanabha.  8 and destroyer of enemies in the battle. The divine Rishis call\nthee shelter of refugees, as well as the giver of shelter. Thou hast a\nthousand horns,  9 a hundred heads.  10 Thou art respected of the respected;\nand the lord and first creator of the three worlds. Thou art the forefather\nand shelter of Siddhas,  11 and Sadhyas.  12 Thou all sacrifices; Vashfatkara,\n13 Omkara.  14 Thou art beyond those who are beyond our senses. There is none\nwho knows who thou art and who knows thy beginning and end. Thou art seen in\nall material objects, in Brahmans, in cows, and also in all the quarters, sky\nand streams. Thou hast a thousand feet, a hundred heads, and a thousand eyes.\nThou hast borne the material objects and the earth with the mountains; and at\nthe bottom of the ocean thou art seen the great serpent. O Rama, Thou hast\nborne the three worlds, gods, Gandharvas, 15 and demons. I am, O Rama, thy\nheart; the goddess of learning is thy tongue; the gods are the hairs of thy\nbody; the closing of thy eyelids is called the night: and their opening is\ncalled the day. The Vedas are thy Sanskaras. 16 Nothing can exist without\nthee. The whole world is thy body; the surface of the earth is thy stability.\n\np. 562\n\nO S\'rivatsalakshana, fire is thy anger, and the moon is thy favour. In the\ntime of thy incarnation named Vamana, thou didst pervade the three worlds with\nthy three steps; and Mahendra was made the king of paradise by thee having\nconfined the fearful Bali. 1 Sita (thy wife) is Lakshmi; and thou art the God\nVishnu, 2 Krishna, 3 and Prajapati. To kill Ravan thou hast assumed the form\nof a man; therefore, O best of the virtuous, thou hast completed this task\nimposed by us (gods). O Rama, Ravana has been killed by thee: now being joyful\n(e. i. having for some time reigned in the kingdom of Ayodhya,) go to\nparadise. O glorious Rama, thy power and thy valour are never failing. The\nvisit to thee and the prayers made to thee are never fruitless. Thy devotees\nwill never be unsuccessful. Thy devotees who obtain thee (thy favour) who art\nfirst and best of mankind, shall obtain their desires in this world as well as\nin the next. They who recite this prayer, founded on the Vedas (or first\nuttered by the sages), and the old and divine account of (Rama) shall never\nsuffer defeat."\n\nTHE MEETING, PAGE 503.\n\nThe _Bharat-Mil ap_ or meeting with Bharat, is the closing scene of the\ndramatic representation of Rama\'s great victory and triumphant return which\ntakes place annually in October in many of the cities of Northern India. The\nRam-Lala or Play of Rama, as the great drama is called, is performed in the\nopen air and lasts with one day\'s break through fifteen successive days. At\nBenares there are three nearly simultaneous performances, one provided by H.\nH. the Maharajah of Benares near his palace at Ramnaggur, one by H. H. the\nMaharajah of Vizianagram near the Missionary settlement at Sigra and at other\nplaces in the city, and one by the leading gentry of the city at Chowka Ghat\nnear the College. The scene especially on the great day when the brothers meet\nis most interesting: the procession of elephants with their gorgeous howdahs\nof silver and gold and their magnificently dressed riders with priceless\njewels sparkling in their turbans, the enthusiasm of the thousands of\nspectators who fill the streets and squares, the balconies and the housetops,\nthe flowers that are rained down upon the advancing car, the wild music, the\nshouting and the joy, make an impression that is not easily forgotten.\n\n  \n   _Still on his head, well trained in lore  \n   Of duty, Rama\'s shoes he bore._  \n\nRama\'s shoes are here regarded as the emblems of royalty or possession. We may\ncompare the Hebrew "Over Edom will I cast forth my shoe." A curiously similar\npassage occurs in LYSCHANDER\'S _Chronicon Greenlandi ae Rhythmicon_:\n\n  \n   "Han sendte til Irland sin skiden skoe,  \n   Og bod den Konge. Som der monne boe,  \n   Han skulde dem haederlig baere  \n   Pan Juuledag i sin kongelig Pragt,  \n   Og kjende han havde sit Rige og Magt  \n   Af Norges og Quernes Herre."  \n\np. 563\n\n  \n   He sent to Ireland his dirty shoes,  \n   And commanded the king who lived there  \n   To wear them with honour  \n   On Christmas Day in his royal state,  \n   And to own that he had his kingdom and power  \n   From the Lord of Norway and the Isles.  \n   _Notes & Queries, March_ 30, 1872.  \n\nI end these notes with an extract which I translate from Signor Gorreslo\'s\nPreface to the tenth volume of his Ramayan, and I take this opportunity of\nagain thankfully acknowledging my great obligations to this eminent\nS\'anskritist from whom I have so frequently borrowed. As Mr. Muir has\nobserved, the Bengal recension which Signor Gorresio has most ably edited is\nthroughout an admirable commentary on the genuine Ramayan of northern India,\nand I have made constant reference to the faithful and elegant translation\nwhich accompanies the text for assistance and confirmation in difficulties:\n\n"Towards the southern extremity and in the island of Lanka (Ceylon) there\nexisted undoubtedly a black and ferocious race, averse to the Aryans and\nhostile to their mode of worship: their ramifications extended through the\nislands of the Archipelago, and some traces of them remain in Java to this\nday.\n\nThe Sanskrit-Indians, applying to this race a name expressive of hatred which\noccurs in the Vedas as the name of hostile, savage and detested beings, called\nit the Rakshas race: it is against these Rakshases that the expedition of Rama\nwhich the Ramayan celebrates is directed. The Sanskrit-Indians certainly\naltered in their traditions the real character of this race: they attributed\nto it physical and moral qualities not found in human nature; they transformed\nit into a race of giants; they represented it as monstrous, hideous,\ntruculent, changing forms at will, blood-thirsty and ravenous, just as the\nSemites represented the races that opposed them as impious, horrible and of\nmonstrous size. But notwithstanding these mythical exaggerations, which are\npartly due to the genius of the Aryans so prone to magnify everything without\nmeasure, the Ramayan in the course of its epic narration has still preserved\nand noted here and there some traits and peculiarities of the race which\nreveal its true character. It represents the Rakshases as black of hue, and\ncompares them with black clouds and masses of black collyrium; it attributes\nto them curly woolly hair and thick lips, it depicts them as loaded with\nchains, collars and girdles of gold, and the other bright ornaments which\ntheir race has always loved, and in which the kindred races of the Soudan\nstill delight. It describes them as worshippers of matter and force. They are\nhostile to the religion of the Aryans whose rites and sacrifices they disturb\nand ruin...Such is the Rakshas race as represented in the Ramayan; and the war\nof the Aryan Rama forms the subject of the epic, a subject certainly real and\nhistorical as far as regards its substance, but greatly exaggerated by the\nancient myth. In Sanskrit-Indian tradition are found traces of another\nstruggle of the Aryans with the Rakshas races, which preceded the war of Rama.\nAccording to some pauranic legends, Karttavirya a descendant of the royal\ntribe of tha Yadavas, contemporary with Parasurama and a little anterior to\nRama, attacked Lanka and took Ravan prisoner. This well shows how ancient and\nhow deeply rooted in the Aryan race is the thought of this war which the\nRamayan celebrates.\n\np. 564\n\n"But," says an eminent Indianist  1 whose learning I highly appreciate, "the\nRamayan if an allegorical epic, and no precise and historical value can be\nassigned to it. Sita signifies the furrow made by the plough, and under this\nsymbolical aspect has already appeared honoured with worship in the hymns of\nthe Rig-veda; Rama is the bearer of the plough (this assertion is entirely\ngratuitous; these two allegorical personages represented agriculture\nintroduced to the southern regions of India by the race of the Kosalas from\nwhom Rama was descended; the Rakshases on whom he makes war are races of\ndemons and giants who have little or nothing human about them; allegory\ntherefore predominates in the poem, and the exact reality of an historical\nevent must not be looked for in it." Such is Professor Weber\'s opinion. If he\nmeans to say that mythical fictions are mingled with real events,\n\nForsan in alcun vero suo arco percuote,\n\nas Dante says, and I fully concede the point. The interweaving of the myth\nwith the historical truth belongs to the essence, so to speak, of the\nprimitive epopeia. If Sita is born, as the Ramayan feigns, from the furrow\nwhich King Janak opened when he ploughed the earth, not a whit more real is\nthe origin of Helen and Aeneas as related in Homer and Virgil, and if the\ncharacters in the Ramayan exceed human nature, and in a greater degree perhaps\nthan is the case in analogous epics, this springs in part from the nature of\nthe subject and still more from the symbol-loving genius of the orient. Still\nthe characters of the Ramayan, although they exceed more or less the limits of\nhuman nature, act notwithstanding in the course of the poem, speak, feel,\nrejoice and grieve according to the natural impulse of human passions. But if\nby saying that the Ramayan is an allegorical epic, it is meant that its\nfundamental subject is nothing but allegory, that the war of the Aryan Rama\nagainst the Rakshas race is an allegory, that the conquest of the southern\nregion and of the island of Lanka is an allegory, I do not hesitate to answer\nthat such a presumption cannot be admitted and that the thing is in my opinion\nimpossible. Father Paolino da S. Bartolommeo, 2 had already, together with\nother strange opinions of his own on Indian matters, brought forward a similar\nidea, that is to say that the exploit of Rama which is the subject of the\nRamayan was a symbol and represented the course of the sun: thus he imagined\nthat Brahma was the earth, Vishnu the water, and that his avatars were the\nblessings brought by the fertilizing waters, etc. But such ideas, born at a\ntime when Indo-sanskrit antiquities were enveloped in darkness, have been\ndissipated by the light of new studies. How could an epic so dear in India to\nthe memory of the people, so deeply rooted for many centuries in the minds of\nall, so propagated and diffused through all the dialects and languages of\nthose region, which had become the source of many dramas which are still\nrepresented in India, which is itself represented every year with such\nmagnificence and to such crowds of people in the neighbourhood of Ayodhya, a\npoem welcomed at its very birth with such favour, as the legend relates, that\nthe recitation of it by the first wandering Rhapsodists has consecrated and\nmade famous all the places celebrated\n\np. 565\n\nby them, and where Rama made a shorter or longer stay, how, I ask, could such\nan epic have been purely allegorical? How, upon a pure invention, upon a\nsimple allegory, could a poem have been composed of about fifty thousand\nverses, relating with such force and power the events, and giving details with\nsuch exactness? On a theme purely allegorical there may easily be composed a\nshort mythical poem, as for example a poem on Proserpine or Psyche: but never\nan epic so full of traditions and historical memories, so intimately connected\nwith the life of the people, as the Ramayan. 1 Excessive readiness to find\nallegory whenever some traces of symbolism occur, where the myth partly veils\nthe historical reality, may lead and often has led to error. What poetical\nwork of mythical times could stand this mode of trial? could there not be\nmade, or rather has there not been made a work altogether allegorical, out of\nthe Homeric poems? We have all heard of the ingenious idea of the anonymous\nwriter, who in order to prove how easily we may pass beyond the truth in our\nwish to seek and find allegory everywhere, undertook with keen subtlety to\nprove that the great personality of Napoleon I. was altogether allegorical and\nrepresented the sun. Napoleon was born in an island, his course was from west\nto east, his twelve marshals were the twelve signs of the zodiac, etc.\n\nI conclude then, that the fundamental theme of the Ramayan, that is to say the\nwar of the Aryan Rama against the Rakshases, an Hamitic race settled in the\nsouth, ought to be regarded as real and historical as far as regards its\nsubstance, although the mythic element intermingled with the true sometimes\nalters its natural and genuine aspect.\n\nHow then did the Indo-Sanskrit epopeia form and complete itself? What elements\ndid it interweave in its progress? How did it embody, how did it clothe the\nnaked and simple primitive datum? We must first of all remember that the Indo-\nEuropean races possessed the epic genius in the highest degree, and that they\nalone in the different regions they occupied produced epic poetry...But other\ncauses and particular influences combined to nourish and develop the epic germ\nof the Sanskrit-Indians. Already in the Rig-veda are found hymns in which the\nAryan genius preluded, so to speak, to the future epopeia, in songs that\ncelebrated the heroic deeds of Indra, the combats and the victories of the\ntutelary Gods of the Aryan races over enemies secret or open, human or\nsuperhuman, the exploits and the memories of ancient heroes. More recently, at\ncertain solemn occasions, as the very learned A. Weber remarks, at the\nsolemnity, for example of the As\'vamedha of sacrifice of the horse, the\npraises of the king who ordained the great rite were sung by bards and\nministrels in songs composed for the purpose, the memories of past times were\nrecalled and honourable mention was made of the just and pious kings of old.\nIn the _Br ahmanas_, a sort of prose commentaries annexed to the Vedas, are\nfound recorded stories and legends which allude to historical events of the\npast ages, to ancient memories, and to mythical events. Such popular legends\nwhich the _Br ahmanas_ undoubtedly gathered from tradition admirably suited\nthe epic tissue with which they were interwoven by successive hands......Many\nand various mythico-historical traditions suitable for epic development, were\ndiffused among the Aryan races, those for example which are related\n\np. 566\n\nin the four chapters containing the description of the earth, the Descent of\nthe Ganges, etc. The epic genius however sometimes created beings of its own\nand gave body and life to ideal conceptions. Some of the persons in the\nRamayan must be, in my opinion, either personifications of the forces of\nnature like those which are described with such vigour in the _Sh ahnamah_, or\nif not exactly created, exaggerated beyond human proportions; others, vedic\npersonages much more ancient than Rama, were introduced into the epic and\nwoven into its narrations, to bring together men who lived in different and\ndistant ages, as has been the case in times nearer to our own, in the epics, I\nmean, of the middle ages.\n\nIn the introduction I have discussed the antiquity of the Ramayan; and by\nmeans of those critical and inductive proofs which are all that an antiquity\nwithout precise historical dates can furnish I have endeavoured to establish\nwith all the certainy that the subject admitted, that the original composition\nof the Ramayan is to be assigned to about the twelfth century before the\nChristian era. Not that I believe that the epic then sprang to life in the\nform in which we now possess it; I think, and I have elsewhere expressed the\nopinion, that the poem during the course of its rhapsodical and oral\npropagation appropriated by way of episodes, traditions, legends and ancient\nmyths......But as far as regards the epic poem properly so called which\ncelebrates the expedition of Rama against the Rakshases I think that I have\nsufficiently shown that its origin and first appearance should be placed about\nthe twelfth century B C.; nor have I hitherto met with anything to oppose this\nchronological result, or to oblige me to rectify or reject it......But an\neminent philologist already quoted, deeply versed in these studies, A. Weber,\nhas expressed in some of his writings a totally different opinion; and the\nauthority of his name, if not the number and cogency of his arguments, compels\nme to say something on the subject. From the fact or rather the assumption\nthat Megasthenes  1 who lived some time in India has made no mention either of\nthe Mahabharat or the Ramayan Professor Weber argues that neither of these\npoems could have existed at that time; as regards the Ramayan, the unity of\nits composition, the chain that binds together its different parts, and its\nallegorical character, show it, says Professor Weber, to be much more recent\nthan the age to which I have assigned it, near to our own era, and according\nto him, later than the Mahabharat. As for Megasthenes it should be observed,\nthat he did not write a history of India, much less a literary history or\nanything at all resembling one, but a simple description, in great part\nphysical, of India: whence, from his silence on literary matters to draw\ninferences regarding the history of Sanskrit literature would be the same\nthing as from the silence of a geologist with respect to the literature of a\ncountry whose valleys, mountains, and internal structure he is exploring, to\nconjecture that such and such a poem or history not mentioned by him did not\nexist at his time. We have only to look at the fragments of Megasthenes\ncollected and published by Schwanbeck to see what was the nature and scope of\nhis _Indica_.................. But only a few fragments of Megasthenes are\nextant; and to pretend that they should be argument and proof enough to judge\nthe antiquity of a poem is to press the laws of criticism too far. To\nProfessor Weber\'s argument as to the more or\n\np. 567\n\nless recent age of the Ramayan from the unity of its composition, I will make\none sole reply, which is that if unity of composition were really a proof of a\nmore recent age, it would be necessary to reduce by a thousand years at least\nthe age of Homer and bring him down to the age of Augustus and Virgil; for\ncertainly there is much more unity of composition, a greater accord and\nharmony of parts in the Iliad and the Odyssey than in the Ramayan. But in the\nfine arts perfection is no proof of a recent age: while the experience and the\ncontinuous labour of successive ages are necessary to extend and perfect the\nphysical or natural sciences, art which is spontaneous in its nature can\nproduce and has produced in remote times works of such perfection as later\nages have not been able to equal."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[516:1](ry502.htm#fr_1053) _The Academy_ , Vol. III., No 43, contains an able\nand interesting notice of this work from the pen of the Professor of Sanskrit\nin the University of Cambridge: \'The _Uttarak anda_.\' Mr. Cowell remarks,\n\'bears the same relation to the _R amayana_, as the Cyclic poems to the\n_Iliad_. Just as the _Cypria_ of Stasinus, the _Aethiopis_ of Arctinus, and\nthe little _Iliad_ of Lesches completed the story of the p. 517 _Iliad_ , and\nnot only added the series of events which preceded and followed it, but also\nfounded episodes of their own on isolated allusions in Homer, so the _Uttarak\nanda_ is intended to complete the _R amayana_, and at the same time to\nsupplement it by intervening episodes to explain casual allusions or isolated\nincidents which occur in it. Thus the early history of the giant Ravana and\nhis family fills nearly forty Chapters, and we have a full account of his wars\nwith the gods and His conquest of Lanka, which all happened long before the\naction of the poem commences, just as the _Cypria_ narrated the birth and\nearlv history of Helen, and the two expeditions of the Greeks against Troy;\nand the latter chapters continue the history of the hero Rama after his\ntriumphant return to his paternal kingdom, and the poem closes with his death\nand that of his brothers, and the founding by their descendants of various\nkingdoms in different parts of India.\'\n\n[518:1](ry502.htm#fr_1054) Muir, _Sanskrit Texts,_ Part IV., pp. 414 ff.\n\n[519:1](ry502.htm#fr_1055) MUIR, _Sanskrit Texts_ , Part IV, 391, 392.\n\n[520:1](ry502.htm#fr_1056) See _Academy_ , III., 43.\n\n[521:1](ry502.htm#fr_1057) _Academy_ , Vol. III., No. 43.\n\n[522:1](ry502.htm#fr_1058) E.
