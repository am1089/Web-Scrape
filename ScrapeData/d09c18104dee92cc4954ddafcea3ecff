Just as in the case of the offerings. This has been explained.\n\nIn the daharavidya ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1 ff.) the text, 'those who depart having\nknown here the Self, and those true desires,' declares at first a meditation\non the small ether, i.e. the highest Self, and separately therefrom a\nmeditation on its qualities, viz. true desires, and so on. The doubt here\narises whether, in the meditation on those qualities, the meditation on the\nhighest Self--as that to which the qualities belong--is to be repeated or not.\n--It is not to be repeated, the Purvapakshin maintains; for the highest Self\nis just that which is constituted by the qualities--freedom from all evil, and\nso on--and as that Self so constituted\n\np. 666\n\ncan be comprised in one meditation, there is no need of repeating the\nmeditation on account of the qualities.--This view the Sutra sets aside. The\nmeditation has to be repeated. The highest Self indeed is that being to which\nalone freedom from evil and the other qualities belong, and it forms the\nobject of the first meditation; yet there is a difference between it as viewed\nin its essential being and as viewed as possessing those qualities; and\nmoreover, the clause 'free from evil, from old age,' &c. enjoins a meditation\non the Self as possessing those qualities. It is therefore first to be\nmeditated on in its essential nature, and then there takes place a repetition\nof the meditation on it in order to bring in those special qualities. The case\nis analogous to that of 'the offerings.' There is a text 'He is to offer a\npuro _d_ asa on eleven potsherds to Indra the ruler, to Indra the supreme\nruler, to Indra the self-ruler.' This injunction refers to one and the same\nIndra, possessing the qualities of rulership and so on; but as, through\nconnexion with those several qualities, the aspects of Indra differ, the\noblation of the puro _d_ asa has to be repeated. This is declared in the\nSankarsha _n_ a, 'The divinities are different on account of separation.'--\nHere terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'offerings.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 43.
