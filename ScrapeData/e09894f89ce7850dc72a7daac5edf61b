Shr\xc4\xab Krishna is\nregarded as the most perfect of all Teachers\xc2\x97so much so that he could speak\nabout everything from the divine standpoint and with divine knowledge of the\nreality beyond mind, so that when saying "I" he spoke as an incarnation of the\nDivine Being. He is considered to have lived about 5050 years ago, and the\n_Bhagavad G \xc4\xabt\xc4\x81_ is regarded as a record of what he said or sang to his\ndevoted friend and disciple Arjuna, who was in\n\np. 42\n\na state of despondency because he could not solve a problem of "right or\nwrong" in which his emotions were very much involved. The problem was whether\nto fight or not in a certain battle which was about to begin. Arjuna\'s\nparticular problem does not concern us now. The yoga-teaching it called forth\nfrom Shr\xc4\xab Krishna is read and meditated upon by millions of people every day.\n\nShr\xc4\xab Krishna\'s teaching is more a yoga for the emotions than the mind,\nalthough he does explain the necessity for mind-control and uses the same two\nwords\xc2\x97practice ( _abhy \xc4\x81sa_) and uncoloredness ( _vair \xc4\x81gya_) for describing\nthe means to its attainment as Patanjali does when starting his teaching. Shr\xc4\xab\nKrishna tells Arjuna that though his heart is in the right place his unhappy\nemotional state is due to ignorance. The first point of the Teacher\'s\ninstruction is\xc2\x97do not judge right and wrong from the standpoint of bodily\nappearances, but only from what is of value to the immortal soul, taking into\naccount that actions, emotions, thoughts and decisions all have some effect,\nsome tending downwards or away from self-realization and others tending\nupwards or toward self-realization. Downwards there is bondage and sorrow;\nupwards there is joy and freedom or the divine state of being, so let this\nfirst point be firmly understood at the beginning. Shr\xc4\xab Krishna said: "You\nhave sorrowed for\n\np. 43\n\nthose who need no sorrow, yet you speak words of wisdom. Those who know do not\ngrieve for the living, nor for the dead. Certainly never at any time was I\nnot, nor you, nor these lords of men, nor shall we ever cease to be hereafter.\nAs there is for the owner of the body childhood, youth and old age in this\nbody, so there comes another body; the intelligent man is not confused by\nthat. Just as a man, having cast off his worn-out clothes, obtains others\nwhich are new, so the owner of the body, having thrown away old bodies goes to\nnew ones. Weapons do not cut him; fire does not burn him; waters do not wet\nhim; the wind does not dry him away . . ." 1\n\nThis point being clear the Teacher goes on to the next. He says in verse ii 39\nthat what he has given is knowledge, based upon his own supersensuous\nexperience as well as that of ancient Teachers, but now he wants Arjuna to\ntake up something more than mere knowledge-yoga\xc2\x97he wants him to take up\n_buddhi-yoga_. _Buddhi_ is wisdom, which comes from doing all things for the\nbenefit of souls, not bodies primarily. It is _buddhi_ or wisdom to revalue\neverything from that standpoint.\n\nIt is easy to see that the heart of wisdom is love for the co-souls, which\nKrishna calls indestructible _j \xc4\xabvabh\xc5\xabtas_, that is, living beings, as\ndistinguished from\n\np. 44\n\ntemporary states and conditions, which are called _bh \xc4\x81vas_. Thus the human\npersonalities, in all their varieties are _bh \xc4\x81vas_, or existent conditions,\nbut the real men who are owners of the personalities are immortal beings. The\nlesson that the heart of wisdom is love\xc2\x97goodwill, brotherhood\xc2\x97is driven home\nby Shr\xc4\xab Krishna in his third discourse or chapter, in which he states that the\ninterdependence of all the living beings in the world is universal, and as\nthis is so one should co-operate heartily, not merely mentally but with love,\nfor the very simple reason that the man who loves cannot abstain from\nactivity. He is in a vigorous state, for love is the great energy of the soul.\nHe is like the typical gentleman of Confucius, who was defined as never\nneutral, but always impartial.\n\nThe man of love looks out upon the world, and feels that he must do what he\ncan, however small the opportunity, for the welfare of mankind. This important\nfact was also soon placed before Arjuna by his Teacher. After pointing out how\nall the living beings in the world are related to one another in service, how\neverywhere there is interdependence, he then declared that the man who on\nearth does not follow the wheel thus revolving lives in vain. Said Shr\xc4\xab\nKrishna: "The man who performs actions without personal attachment reaches the\n\'beyond\'; therefore always do work which ought to be done, without\n\np. 45\n\npersonal attachment. Janaka and others attained perfection through work, so,\nhaving regard to the welfare of the world, it is proper for you to work." 2\nThere is great significance in the words which have been translated "the\nwelfare of the world." They are _loka-sangraha_ , _loka_ means the\ninhabitants; _sangraha_ means their holding or combining together, their\nliving in harmony. This means love, and if there must be fighting, it is a\nregrettable necessity, and is to be done still with love in the heart.\n\nIt is in this activity that work and love are brought together. What is called\n_karma-yoga_ thus comes into being. Mere work or karma is not yoga, but when\nthat work is energized by love for mankind, it becomes a yoga, that is, a\nmethod for the realization of the unity of life. So _karma-yoga_ is one branch\nof Krishna\'s great teaching of love. The _karma-yog \xc4\xab_ "goes about doing\ngood."\n\nAnd yet that _karma-yoga_ is also devotion to God. Among Krishna\'s devotees,\nas among those of Christ, there are two distinct kinds. There are those who\nadmire the teacher because he was the great lover of mankind; and there are\nthose who fall down in admiration and devotion before the greatness and\ngoodness of the teacher, and then learn from his example and precept to spread\nsome of his love around them,\n\np. 46\n\namong their fellow-men. Some love man first and God afterwards; others love\nGod first and man afterwards. The first are the _karma-yog \xc4\xabs_; the second the\n_bhakti-yog \xc4\xabs_.\n\nGod himself is depicted in the _G \xc4\xabt\xc4\x81_ as the greatest karma yog\xc4\xab, the pattern\nfor all who would follow that path. He says: "There is nothing in the three\nworlds, O P\xc4\x81rtha, that I ought to do, and nothing attainable unattained, yet I\nengage in work. Certainly if I did not always engage in work without laziness,\npeople on all sides would follow my path. These worlds would become lost if I\ndid not work; I would be the maker of confusion, and would ruin these\ncreatures." 3 No reason can be given why he should thus work, except that he\nloves the world.\n\nBut let no man be discouraged in this work because he himself is small. Let\nnot his vision of great things and devotion to great beings cause him to sink\ndown disconsolate, thinking, "There is nothing that I can do that is big\nenough to be worth the doing." Let him remember that spiritual things are not\nmeasured by quantity but their greatness consists in the purity of their\nmotive. It is the love that counts\xc2\x97not the action. It is one of the greatest\nglories of this universe that the common and inconspicuous life of ordinary\nmen contains a thousand daily opportunities of spiritual\n\np. 47\n\nsplendor. Says Shr\xc4\xab Krishna: "Men reach perfection, each being engaged in his\nown _karma_. Better is one\'s own _dharma_ though inglorious, than the well-\nperformed _dharma_ of another. He who does the duty determined by his own\nstate incurs no fault. By worshipping in his own _karma_ (work) him from whom\nall beings come, him by whom all this is spread out, a man attains\nperfection." 4\n\nThe words _dharma_ and _karma_ here require explanation. _Dharma_ means where\nyou stand. Each man has to some extent unfolded the flower of his possibility.\nHe stands in a definite position, or holds definite powers of character. It is\nbetter that he should recognize his position and be content with it, true to\nthe best he knows, than that he should try to stand in the position of\nanother, or waste his powers in mere envious admiration. To use his powers in\nthe kind of work he can do, upon and with the material that his past karma has\nprovided for him in the present is not only the height of practical wisdom\xc2\x97it\nis worship of God as well. All life lived in this way is worship; ploughing\nand reaping, selling and buying\xc2\x97whatever it may be. Conventional forms of\nkneeling and prostration are not the sole or even the necessary constituents\nof worship, but every act of the _karma-yog \xc4\xab_ and of the _bhakti-yog \xc4\xab_ is\nthat. The word bhakti does in\n\np. 48\n\nfact contain more of the meaning of service than of feeling.\n\nThe Lord does not ask from his devotees great gifts. Says Shr\xc4\xab Krishna: "When\nanyone offers to me with devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or a little water,\nI accept that, which is brought with devotion by the striving soul. When you\ndo anything, eat anything, sacrifice anything, give anything or make an\neffort, do it as an offering to me. Thus shall you be released from the bonds\nof karma, having their good and bad results, and being free and united through\n_sanny \xc4\x81sa_ (renunciation) you will come to me. I am alike to all beings; none\nis disliked by me, and none is favorite; but those who worship me with\ndevotion are in me and I also am in them. Even if a great evildoer worships\nme, not devoted to anything else, he must be considered good, for he has\ndetermined well. Quickly he becomes a man of _dharma_ and attains constant\npeace." 5 It is clear, then, that this yoga is a way of thinking, and acting,\ninspired by love, which releases a man from bondage to his own personality.\n\nAs there is community of work between God and man, so is there community of\ninterest, and indeed, community of feeling. "All this is threaded on me," says\nthe Divine, "like a collection of pearls on a\n\np. 49\n\nstring." 6 And the reward of the path of yoga is the full realization of this\nunity: "At the end of many lives the man having wisdom approaches me. By\ndevotion he understands me, according to what I really am; then, having truly\nknown me, he enters that (state) immediately. Although always doing work,\nhaving me for goal, through my grace he obtains the eternal indestructible\ngoal." 7\n\nThe love of man for God is more than reciprocated; "He who has no dislike for\nany being, but is friendly and kind, without greed or egotism, the same in\npleasure and pain, forgiving, always content, harmonious, self-controlled and\nresolute, with thought and affection intent upon me, he, my devotee, is dear\nto me. He from whom people are not repelled, and who does not avoid the world,\nfree from the agitations of delight, impatience and fear, is dear to me. Those\ndevotees who are intent upon this deathless way of life, thus declared, full\nof faith, with me as (their) supreme\xc2\x97they are above all dear to me." 8\n\nSome of the devotional verses suggest a great absence of self-reliance _if_\nthey are taken out of their general context, as, for instance: "Giving up all\n_dharmas_ come only to me as your refuge. Do not sorrow;\n\np. 50\n\n[paragraph continues] I will release you from all sins." This "I" to whom\nreference is so often made, is the one Self, the one life, and therefore it\nadvocates the giving up of selfishness and taking interest in the welfare of\nall. There is in all this no suggestion anywhere that man should lean upon an\nexternal God, an entity. This devotion is required to the "me" which is _all_\nlife, and not a portion of life in some external form, however grand. Shr\xc4\xab\nKrishna speaks for that one life "equally present in all." 9\n\nThe objective side of this is by no means ignored in this teaching of the\nimportance of the soul, indeed, of all souls. While the souls bring themselves\nmore and more into harmony through the power of love or wisdom or _buddhi_ ,\ncertain material standards are recognized. The material side, consisting of\nall the _bh \xc4\x81vas_ or conditions, must be brought into a state of orderliness\nand appropriateness called _sattwa_. In the teaching of this part of the\nsubject Shr\xc4\xab Krishna says that everything in Nature can be classed under one\nof three heads\xc2\x97it is _t \xc4\x81masic_, that is, material and sluggish, or _r\n\xc4\x81jasic_, that is, active and restless, or _s \xc4\x81ttwic_, orderly and harmonious.\nThis is in agreement with both ancient and modern thought.\n\nModern science recognizes three properties in Nature, or three essential\nconstituents in the objectivity\n\np. 51\n\nof the external world. One of these is materiality, or the ability of\nsomething to occupy space and resist the intrusion of another body into the\nsame space. The second is natural energy or force, and the third is natural\nlaw and order. There is no object to be found anywhere, be it large or small,\nwhich does not show something of all these three, as it occupies space, shows\ninternal or external energy, and "obeys" (or operates) at least some of\nNature\'s laws. These three qualities of Nature were also well known to the\nancient Hindus under the names of _tamas_ , _rajas_ and _sattwa_ , and they\nheld that things differed from one another according to the varied proportions\nof these three ultimate ingredients. Thus an object in which materiality\npredominated would be described as _t \xc4\x81masic_, and one in which energy was\nmost prominent would be spoken of as _r \xc4\x81jasic_.\n\nThe same adjectives are applied very fully in the _G \xc4\xabt\xc4\x81_ to the personalities\nof men. 10 In the early stages of human awakening we have the very material or\n_t \xc4\x81masic_ man, who is sluggish and scarcely cares to move, unless he is\nstirred by a strong stimulus from the outside. Next comes the man in whom\n_rajas_ has developed, who is now eager for excitement and full of energy.\nPerhaps the bulk of people in the modern world are in this condition, or\nbeginning to come into\n\np. 52\n\nit. _Rajas_ sends them forth into great activity with every kind of greed,\nfrom the lowest lust of the body to the highest forms of ambition for wealth\nand fame and power. Men of this kind cannot restrain themselves\xc2\x97to want is to\nact.\n\nThirdly come the people who recognize that there is such a thing as natural\nlaw, who realize, for example, that it does not pay to eat and drink just what\nthey like and as much as they like, but that there are certain regulations,\nabout kind and quantity and time, which pertain to eating and drinking, and\nthat violation of these regulations leads to pain. In time that pain draws\nattention to what is wrong and the man begins to use his intelligence, first\nto try to thwart the pain and avert the law, but later on to understand the\nlaw, and obey. And then, in that obedience he learns that life is far richer\nthan ever he thought it to be before, that there is in it a sweet strong\nrhythm unknown to the man of passion, and that alliance with the law can\nstrengthen and enhance human life beyond all the hopes of the impassioned\nimagination. All good, thoughtful people are in this third stage, obedient and\norderly, and they deserve the name of _s \xc4\x81ttwic_ people.\n\nThe disciple has to see that his material and personal life or _bh \xc4\x81va_ is\nkept in the _s \xc4\x81ttwic_ condition, as regards body, emotions and thoughts. This\nis a great\n\np. 53\n\nyoga undertaking. In this there is plenty to do resembling Patanjali\'s first\nfive steps. At the same time the disciple must go further than the ordinary\ngood man; he must hold himself above all the qualities of Nature ( _tamas_ ,\n_rajas_ and _sattwa_ ), _using_ the _bh \xc4\x81va_, not being immersed and lost in\nit. "Be thou above the three attributes of Nature, O Arjuna," says the\nTeacher, "without the pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, praise and\nblame, riches and poverty), always steadfast in _sattwa_ , careless of\npossessions, having the (real) self." 11\n\nThese laws work out in a multitude of ways in life, but there are three main\nprinciples behind them all\xc2\x97principles of the evolution of consciousness. They\nexpress themselves in the powers of will, love and thought, creative in the\nworld, and self-creative in the man. There are only three things that the man\nmust now not do. He must never cease to use his will in work. In that work he\nmust never break the law of love. And in that work of love he must never act;\nwithout using his intelligence. These are _principles_ \xc2\x97greater than all rules\nand regulations, because they are the living law of the true self; and not\nmuch consideration is required to see that he who follows this law must\nnecessarily show in his practical life all the virtues that are admired by\ngood men of every\n\np. 54\n\nreligion. Indeed, we can adopt from the Greeks the three eternal\nvaluables\xc2\x97goodness, truth and beauty\xc2\x97and say that a man is truly a man only\nwhen he is operating these.\n\nThese teachings condense down to three practical exercises, which convert\nexperience into soul-knowledge. Shr\xc4\xab Krishna does not value life for its own\nsake, or even brotherhood for its own sake, or even love for its own sake. All\nactions are valuable only because they lead to knowledge of realities of the\nsoul and the ultimate self. Regarding the aspirant\'s work or living in the\nworld as stimulating a hunger for something better, which, did he but know it,\ncauses the awakening in himself of a deeper knowledge, and regarding all\n_buddhi-yoga_ and _karma-yoga_ as an offering on the altar of world-welfare,\nvaluable also because they are a means of true self-education, useful to\neverybody, Shr\xc4\xab Krishna says: "Better than the offering of any material object\nis the offering of knowledge, for all work culminates in knowledge. You should\nlearn this by reverence, enquiry and service, and those who know and see the\ntruth will teach you the knowledge. By this you will see all beings without\nexception in the self, and thus in me. Even if you were the most wicked of\nevildoers, you would cross over all sin by the raft of (this) knowledge. As\nfire reduces fuel to ashes, so does the fire of\n\np. 55\n\nknowledge reduce all _karmas_ to ashes. There is indeed no purifier in the\nworld like knowledge. He who is accomplished finds the same in the self in\ncourse of time. Having attained (this) knowledge he very soon goes to the\npeace of the Beyond." 12 The word "knowledge" ( _jn \xc4\x81na_) in the _G \xc4\xabt\xc4\x81_ means\nalways something known\xc2\x97high or low. "Wisdom" is _buddhi_ , meaning the faculty\nof understanding the life side of the world.\n\nThis passage introduces us to a portion of the definite path of training\xc2\x97the\nequivalent of Patanjali\'s practical yoga. It was not sufficient for Arjuna to\nhave great love. If he would tread the path, he must express it in work in the\nform of service, and must also have an enquiring mind, so as to gain some\nunderstanding. The unbalanced character is unfit for the higher path, no\nmatter how great the progress it may have made along one line. Three practices\nare prescribed; reverence, enquiry and service\xc2\x97in the original, _pranip \xc4\x81ta_,\n_pariprashna_ and _sev \xc4\x81_. 13 The first means bowing, or respect for the\nDivine in all beings and events, which is the same thing as Patanjali\'s _\xc4\xab\nshwara-pranidh\xc4\x81na_. The second is enquiry or questioning, resembling\nPatanjali\'s _sw \xc4\x81dhy\xc4\x81ya_. The third is service, another form of practical\neffort, the equivalent\n\np. 56\n\non this path of Patanjali\'s _tapas_. The requirements are thus the same in\neach school, but the order and emphasis varies.\n\nWhen speaking of service, it is necessary to emphasize broad conceptions. Some\nwould narrow it down to personal service to a particular teacher, but the\nwhole _G \xc4\xabt\xc4\x81_ points to that brotherhood which is the doing of one\'s best duty\nto all around, in one\'s own limited sphere of circumstances and ability. The\naspirant should desire the welfare of the world. This does not imply that we\nshould merely engage ourselves with those who are in need, who are weak or\npoor or ignorant, and bestow our assistance upon them. That is a dangerous\npastime, as it tends to a habit of superiority, and often ends in the\nproduction of a missionary spirit which is fatal to occult progress. Right\nassociation with those who are approximately one\'s equals is, on the whole,\nthe best means for rendering the greatest help to others and oneself. Life\ndoes not flow harmoniously across big gaps. The beginner does not become an\nexpert tennis player by playing against great experts, but with those just a\nlittle better than himself, and it is not the business of the greatest expert\nto teach the mere beginner, just as it is not the business of the chief\nprofessor of a college to teach the infant class. A good, sensible, brotherly\nlife, in which one does not embarrass others\n\np. 57\n\nby making conspicuous sacrifices on their behalf, is always the best. The\nteaching does not ask for _r \xc4\x81jasic_ efforts, but a _s \xc4\x81ttwic_ fitting in of\noneself into the social welfare.\n\nWe may see all mankind in process of evolution or self-unfoldment in seven\ndegrees or stages, according to Shr\xc4\xab Krishna\'s teaching. In the first three\nstages the man\'s life is energized from the personality; in the last three,\nfrom the real self. In the middle stage there is a conflict between the two,\nwhile the man is beginning to work at the three practices mentioned above.\n\nThere is one term which Shr\xc4\xab Krishna applies to all those who are renouncing\nallegiance to mere pleasures and self-satisfactions and personal attachment to\nthe objects of the world. He calls them _sanny \xc4\x81s\xc4\xabs_. In the final discourse\nof the _G \xc4\xabt\xc4\x81_, the eighteenth chapter, there is a long explanation of the\nmeaning of the term _sanny \xc4\x81sa_. It is compared with another\xc2\x97 _ty \xc4\x81ga_. _Ty\n\xc4\x81ga_ means abandoning, giving up, leaving behind, and a _ty \xc4\x81g\xc4\xab_ is therefore\none who has renounced the world, given up all possessions, and taken to the\nuncertain life of a religious mendicant, except perhaps that the term\nmendicant is not quite appropriate, since this man does not positively beg.\n_Sanny \xc4\x81sa_ is the same thing in _spirit_. The _sanny \xc4\x81s\xc4\xab_ does not\nnecessarily give up the material things, but he gives up personal attachment\nto them.\n\np. 58\n\nThere is still plenty to do for the man who is becoming more and more\nconscious of the life around him, and therefore less liable to merely personal\ninterests and motives. The things that he must do are described by Shr\xc4\xab\nKrishna as follows: "Acts of _yajna_ , _d \xc4\x81na_ and _tapas_ should not be given\nup, but should be done without personal attachment or desire for results." 14\nThese three kinds of action which alone the _sanny \xc4\x81s\xc4\xab_ is permitted to do,\nand which in fact he must do, are sacrifice, gift and effort.\n\nIt is always unsatisfactory to try to translate these technical Sanskrit words\ninto one-word equivalents in English. Sacrifice ( _yajna_ ) does not mean the\nmere surrender of things, but it really means to make all things holy. This\noccurs when they are offerings. Any action done with an unselfish motive is\nthus holy. The _sanny \xc4\x81s\xc4\xab_ does not, however, need to make any ceremonial\nofferings, because he sees the one life everywhere, and all his actions are\ndirect service of that life. In the West it is significant that "holy" is\nconnected with "whole," and so what is done not for selfish gain but in the\ninterests of all is holy. Sacrifice is thus a law by which living beings are\nrelated into one great brotherhood. A very important part of the teaching of\nthe _G \xc4\xabt\xc4\x81_ is that one should recognize, accept and like the great fact of\nthe mutual support of\n\np. 59\n\nall living beings, and act or live accordingly. This is called the law of\nsacrifice.\n\nThe _sanny \xc4\x81s\xc4\xab_ gives freely; leaving it to the law to repay. He also consents\nto receive only freely, and should any one offer food or anything else for his\nuse, he declines it if the gift is not sincere and free from any suggestion of\nobligation. His life is one of giving ( _d \xc4\x81na_). All his powers are\ncompletely at the service of mankind. And he must strive also, by _tapas_ , to\nincrease those powers. There is plenty to do for the man whose life is only\nsacrifice, gift and effort, whether he be a wandering monk in India or a\nrailroad magnate in the United States.\n\nThis yoga does not exclude meditation. On the contrary it recommends it, but\nwe need not study that here as it has been so fully dealt with in our previous\nchapters.\n\nIn all this teaching one seems to hear the echo of the words of all the\nspiritual guides of mankind: "We are not interested in the outer man, but in\nthe real man in you. Cling to the real man. That is union with yoga. Let this\nbe a matter for frequent reflection and all else will be purified." The\npractice of this meditation is essential, but only brings its effect in\ncombination with the practice of true valuation of things in our material\nliving\xc2\x97which is estimation of their value by love, their value _for_ somebody.\n\np. 60\n\n[paragraph continues] This love leads on to spiritual insight which, as it\ncombines knowing and being, can be called unification\xc2\x97through\npurification\xc2\x97with the ever present Divine reality.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[43:1](gsoy05.htm#fr_30) Verses ii 11, 12, 13, 22, 23.\n\n[45:2](gsoy05.htm#fr_31) iii 19, 20.\n\n[46:3](gsoy05.htm#fr_32) iii 22-24.\n\n[47:4](gsoy05.htm#fr_33) xviii 45-47, and iii 35.\n\n[48:5](gsoy05.htm#fr_34) ix 26-31.\n\n[49:6](gsoy05.htm#fr_35) vii 7.\n\n[49:7](gsoy05.htm#fr_36) vii 19 and xviii 55, 56.\n\n[49:8](gsoy05.htm#fr_37) xii 13-15, 20.\n\n[50:9](gsoy05.htm#fr_38) xiii 27, 28.\n\n[51:10](gsoy05.htm#fr_39) xviii 7-9, 26-28.\n\n[53:11](gsoy05.htm#fr_40) ii 45.\n\n[55:12](gsoy05.htm#fr_41) iv 33-39.\n\n[55:13](gsoy05.htm#fr_42) iv 34.\n\n[58:14](gsoy05.htm#fr_43) xviii 5, 6.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter Four.
