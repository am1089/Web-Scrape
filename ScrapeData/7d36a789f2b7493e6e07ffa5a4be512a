Towards great wealth this lord of the house\n[2](sbe46047.htm#an_1:149:1:2) advances [3](sbe46047.htm#an_1:149:1:3), the\nstrong one in the abode of strong wealth. Let the stones honour him as he\nspeeds forward.\n\n2\\. He the manly (bull) as of men so of the two worlds, whose stream is drunk\nby living beings [1](sbe46047.htm#an_1:149:2:1) in consequence of his renown--\nhe who running forward has ripened in (his mother's) womb--\n\n3\\. He who lighted up the \xe2\x80\xa6 [1](sbe46047.htm#an_1:149:3:1) stronghold, the\nracer, the sage, like a \xe2\x80\xa6 [2](sbe46047.htm#an_1:149:3:2) horse, shining like\nthe sun, endowed with hundredfold life.\n\n4\\. He who has a twofold birth (celestial and terrestrial), the flaming one\nhas approached the threefold light, all spaces of the atmosphere, the Hot _ri_\n, the best sacrificer, in the abode of the Waters.\n\n5\\. This is the Hot _ri_ having a twofold birth [1](sbe46047.htm#an_1:149:5:1)\nwho has bestowed all the best gifts, out of desire of glory, on the quick\nmortal who worships him.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, Vira _g_.--Verses 3-5 = SV. II, 1124-1126.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. My translation of this verse differs from that of Pischel, Ved.\nStudien, II, 100.\n\nNote 2. On pati _h_ dan, comp. Hubschmann, Vocalsystem, 142; Bartholomae,\nArische Forschungen, I, 70; Joh. Schmidt, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, 309;\nPischel, Vedische Studien,\n\np. 177\n\n[paragraph continues] II, 93 seq.; Bartholomae, Indogermanische Forschungen,\nIII, 100 seq.\n\nNote 3. Comp. X, 93, 6. maha _h_ sa raya _h_ a\xc2\xb4 ishate.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. I, 80, 4, and similar passages, in which the waters are called\n_g_ iva-dhanya _h_ , 'the prize (of contests) which living beings have\ngained.'\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. We do not know what na\xc2\xb4rmi _n_ i is. Possibly in this word two words,\nna armi _n_ i, are contained, so that the particle na would be repeated in\neach of the three Padas. The translation would then be: 'he who lighted up the\narmi _n_ i (?) like a stronghold.'\n\nNote 2. I place no confidence in the attempts to find the meaning of a word\nlike nabhany\xcc\x83a _h_ with the aid of etymology only. The same word occurs in I,\n173, 1 as an epithet of the Saman which the priest, who is compared to a bird,\nsings (ga\xc2\xb4yat sa\xc2\xb4ma nabhany\xcc\x83am yatha ve _h_ ). It occurs also in VII, 42, 1.\npra krandanu _h_ nabhanuy\xcc\x83asya vetu. The connection in which these words\nstand, seems to show that the meaning is: 'the noise of the sacrificial fire\nshall arise;' very probably the fire is compared to a horse, and its noise to\nthe neighing of that horse. Thus nabhany\xcc\x83a would be in VII, 42, 1, quite as in\nour passage, an epithet of a horse. This epithet may refer either to the swift\nmotion of the horse and of the Saman ascending to the gods, or more probably\nto the gay voice of the horse, the loud noise of the Saman.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Two syllables are wanting in the first Pada.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 150](sbe46048.htm)\n\n"
