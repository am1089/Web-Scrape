I never had the trial. Now I think it has come.\n\nI used to test my strength of mind by imagining all kinds of evil which might\nhappen to me--poverty, imprisonment, dishonour, death--even Bimala\'s. And when\nI said to myself that I should be able to receive these with firmness, I am\nsure I did not exaggerate. Only I could never even imagine one thing, and\ntoday it is that of which I am thinking, and wondering whether I can really\nbear it. There is a thorn somewhere pricking in my heart, constantly giving me\npain while I am about my daily work. It seems to persist even when I am\nasleep. The very moment I wake up in the morning, I find that the bloom has\ngone from the face of the sky. What is it? What has happened?\n\nMy mind has become so sensitive, that even my past life, which came to me in\nthe disguise of happiness, seems to wring my very heart with its falsehood;\nand the shame and sorrow which are coming close to me are losing their cover\nof privacy, all the more because they try to veil their faces. My heart has\nbecome all eyes. The things that should not be seen, the things I do not want\nto see--these I must see.\n\nThe day has come at last when my ill-starred life has to reveal its\ndestitution in a long-drawn series of exposures. This penury, all unexpected,\nhas taken its seat in the heart where plenitude seemed to reign. The fees\nwhich I paid to delusion for just nine years of my youth have now to be\nreturned with interest to Truth till the end of my days.\n\nWhat is the use of straining to keep up my pride? What harm if I confess that\nI have something lacking in me? Possibly it is that unreasoning forcefulness\nwhich women love to find in men. But is strength mere display of muscularity?\nMust strength have no scruples in treading the weak underfoot?\n\nBut why all these arguments? Worthiness cannot be earned merely by disputing\nabout it. And I am unworthy, unworthy, unworthy.\n\nWhat if I am unworthy? The true value of love is this, that it can ever bless\nthe unworthy with its own prodigality. For the worthy there are many rewards\non God\'s earth, but God has specially reserved love for the unworthy.\n\nUp till now Bimala was my home-made Bimala, the product of the confined space\nand the daily routine of small duties. Did the love which I received from her,\nI asked myself, come from the deep spring of her heart, or was it merely like\nthe daily provision of pipe water pumped up by the municipal steam-engine of\nsociety?\n\nI longed to find Bimala blossoming fully in all her truth and power. But the\nthing I forgot to calculate was, that one must give up all claims based on\nconventional rights, if one would find a person freely revealed in truth.\n\nWhy did I fail to think of this? Was it because of the husband\'s pride of\npossession over his wife? No. It was because I placed the fullest trust upon\nlove. I was vain enough to think that I had the power in me to bear the sight\nof truth in its awful nakedness. It was tempting Providence, but still I clung\nto my proud determination to come out victorious in the trial.\n\nBimala had failed to understand me in one thing. She could not fully realize\nthat I held as weakness all imposition of force. Only the weak dare not be\njust. They shirk their responsibility of fairness and try quickly to get at\nresults through the short- cuts of injustice. Bimala has no patience with\npatience. She loves to find in men the turbulent, the angry, the unjust. Her\nrespect must have its element of fear.\n\nI had hoped that when Bimala found herself free in the outer world she would\nbe rescued from her infatuation for tyranny. But now I feel sure that this\ninfatuation is deep down in her nature. Her love is for the boisterous. From\nthe tip of her tongue to the pit of her stomach she must tingle with red\npepper in order to enjoy the simple fare of life. But my determination was,\nnever to do my duty with frantic impetuosity, helped on by the fiery liquor of\nexcitement. I know Bimala finds it difficult to respect me for this, taking my\nscruples for feebleness--and she is quite angry with me because I am not\nrunning amuck crying _Bande Mataram_.\n\nFor the matter of that, I have become unpopular with all my countrymen because\nI have not joined them in their carousals. They are certain that either I have\na longing for some title, or else that I am afraid of the police. The police\non their side suspect me of harbouring some hidden design and protesting too\nmuch in my mildness.\n\nWhat I really feel is this, that those who cannot find food for their\nenthusiasm in a knowledge of their country as it actually is, or those who\ncannot love men just because they are men--who needs must shout and deify\ntheir country in order to keep up their excitement--these love excitement more\nthan their country.\n\nTo try to give our infatuation a higher place than Truth is a sign of inherent\nslavishness. Where our minds are free we find ourselves lost. Our moribund\nvitality must have for its rider either some fantasy, or someone in authority,\nor a sanction from the pundits, in order to make it move. So long as we are\nimpervious to truth and have to be moved by some hypnotic stimulus, we must\nknow that we lack the capacity for self- government. Whatever may be our\ncondition, we shall either need some imaginary ghost or some actual medicine-\nman to terrorize over us.\n\nThe other day when Sandip accused me of lack of imagination, saying that this\nprevented me from realizing my country in a visible image, Bimala agreed with\nhim. I did not say anything in my defence, because to win in argument does not\nlead to happiness. Her difference of opinion is not due to any inequality of\nintelligence, but rather to dissimilarity of nature.\n\nThey accuse me of being unimaginative--that is, according to them, I may have\noil in my lamp, but no flame. Now this is exactly the accusation which I bring\nagainst them. I would say to them: "You are dark, even as the flints are. You\nmust come to violent conflicts and make a noise in order to produce your\nsparks. But their disconnected flashes merely assist your pride, and not your\nclear vision."\n\nI have been noticing for some time that there is a gross cupidity about\nSandip. His fleshly feelings make him harbour delusions about his religion and\nimpel him into a tyrannical attitude in his patriotism. His intellect is keen,\nbut his nature is coarse, and so he glorifies his selfish lusts under high-\nsounding names. The cheap consolations of hatred are as urgently necessary for\nhim as the satisfaction of his appetites. Bimala has often warned me, in the\nold days, of his hankering after money. I understood this, but I could not\nbring myself to haggle with Sandip. I felt ashamed even to own to myself that\nhe was trying to take advantage of me.\n\nIt will, however, be difficult to explain to Bimala today that Sandip\'s love\nof country is but a different phase of his covetous self-love. Bimala\'s hero-\nworship of Sandip makes me hesitate all the more to talk to her about him,\nlest some touch of jealousy may lead me unwittingly into exaggeration. It may\nbe that the pain at my heart is already making me see a distorted picture of\nSandip. And yet it is better perhaps to speak out than to keep my feelings\ngnawing within me.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II](hw07.htm)\n\n'
