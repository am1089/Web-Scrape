And thus in the Self; for (there are) manifold (powers).\n\nIf attributes belonging to one thing were on that account to be ascribed to\nother things also, it would follow that attributes observed in non-sentient\nthings, such as jars and the like, belong also to the intelligent eternal\nSelf, which is of an altogether different kind. But that such attributes do\nnot extend to the Self is due to the variety of the essential nature of\nthings. This the Sutra expresses in 'for (there are) manifold (powers).' We\nperceive that fire, water, and so on, which are of different kind, possess\ndifferent powers, viz. heat, and so on: there is therefore nothing\nunreasonable in the view that the highest Brahman which differs in kind from\nall things observed in ordinary life should possess innumerous powers not\nperceived in ordinary things. Thus Para _s_ ara also--in reply to a question\nfounded on ordinary observation--viz. 'How can creative energy be attributed\nto Brahman, devoid of qualities, pure, &c.?'--declares 'Numberless powers,\nlying beyond the sphere of all ordinary thought, belong to Brahman, and\nqualify it for creation, and so on; just as\n\np. 475\n\nheat belongs to fire.' Similarly, Scripture says, 'what was that wood, what\nwas that tree from which they built heaven and earth?' &c. ( _Ri_. Sa _m_ h.\nX, 81); and 'Brahman was that wood, Brahman was that tree', and so on.--\nObjections founded on ordinary generalisations have no force against Brahman\nwhich differs in nature from all other things.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 29.
