The one hundred and one-fold Pra _g_ apati, doubtless, is the\nyear, and thereto belong days and\n\np. 322\n\nnights, half-months, months, and seasons. The days and nights of a month are\nsixty, and in the month, doubtless, the days and nights of the year are\nobtained; and there are twenty-four half-months, thirteen months, and three\nseasons (of four months)--that makes a hundred parts, and the year itself is\nthe one hundred and first part.\n\n10:2:6:22\\. By the seasons it is sevenfold,--six seasons (of two months), and\nthe year itself as the seventh part. And he who shines yonder is the light of\nthat year: his rays are a hundredfold, and the (sun's) disk itself is the one\nhundred and first part.\n\n10:2:6:33\\. By the regions it is sevenfold,--the rays which are in the eastern\nregion are one part, and those in the southern are one, and those in the\nwestern are one, and those in the northern are one, and those in the upper\n(region) are one, and those in the lower (region) are one, and the disk itself\nis the seventh part.\n\n10:2:6:44\\. Beyond this (year) lies the wish-granting world; but the wish-\ngranting one is the immortal (element): it is thus the immortal that lies\nbeyond this (year, temporal existence); and that same immortal (element) is\nthat very light which shines yonder.\n\n10:2:6:55\\. Now that same boon (the immortal light), bright with wealth, he,\nSavit _ri_ (the sun), distributes among the distributed creatures, and among\nplants and trees, too; and to some, indeed, he gives more of it, and to some\nless; and they to whom he gives more of it live longest, and they to whom he\ngives less live less long.\n\n10:2:6:66\\. It is regarding this that it is said in the _Ri_ _k_ (I, 22, 7; Va\n_g_. S. XXX, 4), 'The distributer of wealth, the bright boon, we invoke, Savit\n_ri_ , the beholder of men.' And that is the full\n\np. 323\n\n[paragraph continues] (measure of) life, for it is long, it is unending 1; and\nwhen people here say, 'May thy life be long! mayest thou reach the full\n(extent of) life!' it is as much as to say, 'May that, world, may that\n(immortal light) be thine!'\n\n10:2:6:77\\. It is Va _k_ (Speech) that, seeing it, speaks (thus). That same\n(immortal light), indeed, is to be obtained either by the one hundred and one-\nfold (altar), or by a life of a hundred years: whosoever builds a one hundred\nand one-fold (altar), or whosoever lives a hundred years, he, indeed, obtains\nthat immortality. Therefore, whether they know it, or whether they do not,\npeople say, 'The life of a hundred years makes for heaven.' Hence one ought\nnot to yield to his own desire and pass away before (he has attained) the full\nextent of life, for (such shortening of one's life) does not make for the\nheavenly world 2; and these are indeed the worlds, to wit, the days and\nnights, the half-moons, moons, and seasons, and the year.\n\n10:2:6:88\\. Those who pass away in the years below twenty are consigned to the\ndays and nights as their worlds; and those who (pass away) in the years above\ntwenty and below forty, to the half-moons; and those who (pass away) in the\n(years) above forty and below sixty, to the months; and those who (pass away)\nin the (years) above sixty and below\n\np. 324\n\neighty, to the seasons; and those who (pass away) in the (years) above eighty\nand below a hundred (are consigned) to the year; and he alone who lives a\nhundred years or more attains to that immortal (life).\n\n10:2:6:99\\. Only by many sacrifices, indeed, is a single day, or a single\nnight (of life) gained; and only he who builds the one hundred and one-fold\n(altar), or he who lives a hundred years, is certain of his attaining to that\nimmortal (life). But he, indeed, builds a one hundred and one-fold (altar) who\ncarries him (Ukhya Agni) for a year: hence one should only build (an altar\nfor) such an (Agni) who has been carried for a year. Thus much as to the\ndeity.\n\n10:2:6:1010\\. Now as to the sacrifice. When he measures out those one hundred\nand one men (man's lengths) with upstretched arms, that is a one hundred and\none-fold (altar) in form, and a sevenfold one in respect of its layers: the\nlayers contain six seasonal 1 (bricks) and the fire (or altar) itself is the\nseventh form.\n\n10:2:6:1111\\. And, indeed, it is a hundred and one-fold in respect of bricks,\n--the first fifty bricks and the last fifty 2 which are (laid down) make a\nhundred forms (parts); and the bricks which are laid down between (those two\nsets) are the one hundred and first form.\n\np. 325\n\n10:2:6:1212\\. And, having the Ya _g_ us for its light, it is a hundred and\none-fold in respect of the Ya _g_ us (formulas),--the first fifty and the last\nfifty which are (used) make a hundred forms; and the Ya _g_ us which are used\nbetween them are the one hundred and first form. In this way also the\nsevenfold one becomes a hundred and one-fold, and whosoever knows this obtains\neven by the sevenfold one whatever wish there is both in a life of a hundred\nyears and in the one hundred and one-fold (altar).\n\n10:2:6:1313\\. In this way, indeed, all sacrifices 1 up to the Agnihotra are a\nhundred and one-fold by way of verses, formulas, words, syllables, rites, and\nhymn-tunes; and whosoever knows this obtains by every sacrifice whatever wish\nthere is either in a life of a hundred years, or in the one hundred and one-\nfold (altar), or in the sevenfold one. Thus much as to the sacrifice.\n\n10:2:6:1414\\. Now as to the body. There are these four sets of five fingers\nand toes, the two--wrist and elbow 2,--the arm, the shoulder-blade, and the\ncollarbone,--that makes twenty-five; and in the same way (each of) these other\nlimbs,--that makes a hundred parts, and the trunk itself is the one hundred\nand first part. As regards the sevenfold state this has been explained 3.\n\np. 326\n\n10:2:6:1515\\. And, having the vital air for its light, it is a hundred and\none-fold by the vital airs limb by limb, for there is vital air in each limb:\nwhosoever knows this obtains, even by his knowledge, whatever wish there is in\na life of a hundred years, or in the one hundred and one-fold (altar), or in\nthe sevenfold one, or in all sacrifices; for he has obtained a body perfected\nby all the sacrifices.\n\n10:2:6:1616\\. Now, there are these three fivefold (objects), the year, the\nfire, and man: their five forms are food, drink, well-being 1, light, and\nimmortality. Whatever food there is in the year, that is its food; whatever\nwater, that is its drink; its well-being is the night, for in the night, as in\nwell-being (contentment or goodness), all beings dwell together 2; its light\nis the day, and its immortal element the sun. Thus much as to the deity.\n\n10:2:6:1717\\. Now as to the sacrifice. Whatever food is placed on the fire,\nthat is its food, and whatever water, that is its water; its well-being is the\nenclosing-stones, for they are of the nature of nights 3; its light the\n(bricks) with special formulas, for they are of the nature of days; and its\nimmortal\n\np. 327\n\nelement the fire, for that is of the nature of the sun. Thus much as to the\nsacrifice.\n\n10:2:6:1818\\. Now as to the body. Whatever food there is in man, that is his\nfood; whatever water, that is his water; his well-being (safety, strength) is\nthe bones, for they are of the nature of enclosing-stones; his light the\nmarrow, for that is of the nature of the ya _g_ ushmati (bricks); his immortal\nelement the breath, for that is of the nature of fire;--and, indeed, people\nsay, 'The breath is fire, the breath is the immortal.'\n\n10:2:6:1919\\. Now, hunger ceases through food, thirst through drink, evil\nthrough well-being (goodness), darkness through light, and death through\nimmortality; and, in truth, whosoever knows this from him all these pass away,\nand he conquers recurring death, and attains the whole (perfect) life. And let\nhim hold this to be immortality in yonder world and life here below. Some,\nindeed, hold it to be breath, saying, 'The breath is fire, the breath is the\nimmortal;' but let him not believe this, for something uncertain is breath.\nAnd regarding this it has also been said in the Ya _g_ us (Va _g_. S. XII,\n65), 'That (bond) of thine I unloose, as from the middle of \xc3\x82yus (life):' let\nhim therefore hold it to be immortality in yonder world, and life here below,\nand thus, indeed, he attains the whole life.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[323:1](sbe4355.htm#fr_631) Thus Saya _n_ a--tad etat sarvam ayur iti\nsarvapadasyartham aha, dirgham ananta _m_ hi.\n\n[323:2](sbe4355.htm#fr_632) Literally, 'conducive to the world,' or, perhaps,\n'conducive to a place (in yonder world).' Saya _n_ a interprets it by--his\ndeath is 'alokyam,' that is, not procuring the world consisting of\nimmortality. Some such meaning as '(such conduct) is not world-winning' seems\nto be implied by the words which follow.\n\n[324:1](sbe4355.htm#fr_633) The five layers contain five sets of two such\nbricks, each representing the two months of the respective season; except the\nthird layer, which contains four such bricks, only, however, of half the\nthickness of the others.\n\n[324:2](sbe4355.htm#fr_634) According to Saya _n_ a, this refers to the fifty\nPra _n_ abh _ri_ ts in the first, and to the forty Vira _g_ s, five Nakasads,\nand five Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ as in the fifth layer.\n\n[325:1](sbe4355.htm#fr_635) That is, according to Saya _n_ a, all Soma-\nsacrifices,--ekahas, ahinas, sattras, &c. In this case we should perhaps\ntranslate, 'down to the Agnihotra,' that being the simplest kind of Soma-\nsacrifice.\n\n[325:2](sbe4355.htm#fr_636) This meaning is assigned by Saya _n_ a to\n'kalkushi' (= ma _n_ ibandharatni); it cannot mean here 'the two wrists' (?\n'kalyusha,' Mon. Will. Dict.), as both must be parts of the same limb.\n\n[325:3](sbe4355.htm#fr_637) Viz. [X, 2, 2, 1](sbe4351.htm#10:2:2:1).\n[5](sbe4351.htm#10:2:2:5) (VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.).\n\n[326:1](sbe4355.htm#fr_638) Or, perhaps, goodness, excellence ( _s_ ri).\n\n[326:2](sbe4355.htm#fr_639) According to Saya _n_ a, this is an etymological\nplay on the word ' _s_ ri' (well-being, contentment, peace), as connected with\nthe verb ' _s_ ri'-- _s_ riyanti nivasanty asmin kala iti ratri _h_ _s_ ri _s_\nabdava _k_ ya. Cf. II, 3, 1, 3, where, with the Ka _n_ va, we have to read,\n'ilita hi _s_ ere ( _s_ erate, K.) sa _m_ _g_ ana _h_ '--'for (when the sun\nhas set) those who are at variance with one another lie quiet (together).'\n\n[326:3](sbe4355.htm#fr_640) Viz. inasmuch as they enclose the altar, and\nprotect it on all sides. Cf. VII, 1, 1, 12 seq., where the enclosing-stones\nare said to represent the womb in which the embryo Agni is contained; and are\nalso compared with the ocean which flows round the earth like a protecting\nmoat.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 3, 1.
