The sacred fires (shall be) approached from the north, 1\n\n2\\. (And be) left in the same manner.\n\n3\\. The contrary (proceeding should be adopted at sacrifices offered) to the\nmanes. 3\n\np. 193\n\n4\\. Let him wash that which has been touched with (his) foot.\n\n5\\. Let him touch water, in case he touches his body or the hem (of his\ngarment). 5\n\n6: Likewise (let him touch water) after cutting, splitting, digging or\nremoving (anything, or offering oblations) to the manes, to the Rakshasas, to\nNir _ri_ ti, to Rudra, (and after performing sacrifices) intended as spells\n(against enemies).\n\n7\\. Let him not turn round himself a sacrificial implement (the use of) which\nis accompanied by the recitation of mantras. 7\n\n8\\. (For) the sacrificial implements (are) more nearly (connected with the\nsacrifice), 8\n\n9\\. The priests, more remotely.\n\n10\\. The sacrificer and his wife are even nearer than the priests. 10\n\n11\\. After the sacrificial implements (follows) the clarified butter, after\nthe clarified butter the sacrificial viands, after the sacrificial viands the\nanimal to be slain, after the animal the Soma, after the Soma the sacred\nfires. 11\n\np. 194\n\n12\\. If there is work for them, the priests shall not turn away from the\nsacred fires. 12\n\n13\\. If he faces the east, let him turn towards his right shoulder, 13\n\n14\\. If he faces the west, towards the left. 14\n\n15\\. The entrance to the sacrificial (enclosure lies) between the _K_ atvala\nand the Utkara, 15\n\n16\\. (When one comes) from the _K_ atvala, (it lies between) the \xc3\x82havaniya\nfire and the Utkara. 16\n\n17\\. The officiating (priests), the sacrificer, and his wife shall enter by\nthat (road),\n\n18\\. As long as the sacrificial rite is not completed.\n\n19\\. When it has been finished (they shall) pass to and fro on the side where\nthere is no Utkara (i.e. on the western side of the enclosure).\n\np. 195\n\n20\\. Let him not put on the fire logs or Samidhs which have not been sprinkled\n(with water),\n\n21\\. The Brahman (priest) and the sacrificer shall enter in front of the\n\xc3\x82havaniya fire.\n\n22\\. Some (declare that they shall enter) behind the \xc3\x82havaniya fire.\n\n23\\. The seat of the Brahman (priest is situated) to the south of the\n\xc3\x82havaniya fire, (that) of the sacrificer to the west of him. 23\n\n24\\. (The seat) of the Hot _ri_ (priest is situated) to the north of the\nnorthern Sro _n_ i (of the Vedi), 24\n\n25\\. (That) of the \xc3\x82gnidhra priest near the Utkara,\n\n26\\. (That) of the (sacrificer\'s) wife behind the Garhapatya fire.\n\n27\\. He scatters Darbha grass on these (seats) as often as (they are used).\n\n28\\. A vessel filled with water, for the purpose of sipping, shall be\nappropriated to (the use of) each (person).\n\n29\\. He who has been initiated (to the performance of a sacrifice shall) keep\nthe (following) vows:\n\n30\\. Let him not proclaim the guilt of other men; let him not become angry;\nlet him not weep; let him not look at urine and ordure.\n\n31\\. If he has looked at any unclean (substance), he mutters (the verse),\n\'Unrestrained is the internal 31\n\np. 196\n\norgan, wretched (my) eye-sight; the sun is the chief of the (heavenly) lights;\nO Diksha, do not forsake me!\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[192:1](sbe1448.htm#fr_960) **15**. Manava _S_ rauta Sutra I, 1, 1, and\nKumarila thereon in Professor Goldstucker\'s lithographed copy and Katyayana\n_S_ rauta Sutra I, 8, 24. See also Professor Haug\'s map of \'the sacrificial\ncompound,\' Aitareya-brahma _n_ a, vol. i.\n\n[192:3](sbe1448.htm#fr_961) I.e. the entrance and exit are to be made to the\nsouth of the fires.\n\n[193:5](sbe1448.htm#fr_962) Govinda explains si _k_ , \'the hem of the\ngarment,\' by the garment wrapped round the loins (parihita _m_ vasa _h_ ).\n\n[193:7](sbe1448.htm#fr_963) The meaning is that the priest must hold the\nsacrificial implements, such as the sru _k_ and sruva ladles, between himself\nand the fires, and not place himself between them and the fires (atmano bahir\nna kuryat agner antara _h_ svaya _m_ na bhaved iti yavat).\n\n[193:8](sbe1448.htm#fr_964) \'He gives the reason for that (rule), "For the\nsacrificial implements (are) nearer" than the priests, that must be\nunderstood.\'--Govinda.\n\n[193:10](sbe1448.htm#fr_965) \'For they obtain the reward of the sacrifice. The\ninstances (referring) to those two are the Vaisar _g_ anas and the Dakshi _n_\nas:--Govinda.\n\n[193:11](sbe1448.htm#fr_966) Katyayana _S_ rauta Sutra I, 8, 31. \'If the space\non the p. 184 Uttaravedi and the rest is confined, the Soma is made ready\nimmediately after the fire, after that the meat and so forth, after that the\ngrain for the sacrificial cakes, then the clarified butter, and after that the\nspoons called sruva, sru _k_ , and so forth.\'--Govinda.\n\n[194:12](sbe1448.htm#fr_967) \'It is indicated hereby that, if there is work\n(to be done) there, they shall not turn away from the sacred fires except ir\ncases of absolute necessity.\'--Govinda.\n\n[194:13](sbe1448.htm#fr_968) \'This rule (refers to the case) when he walks\nwith the sacred fires. It must be understood that he shall not turn his back\non the fires.\'--Govinda.\n\n[194:14](sbe1448.htm#fr_969) \'This rule (is to be interpreted) in the same\nmanner (as the preceding one). Or it is prescribed by these two Sutras that\nthe men engaged (in the sacrifice) shall go out, turning their right hand\ntowards (the fires).\'--Govinda.\n\n[194:15](sbe1448.htm#fr_970) Katyayana _S_ rauta Sutra V, 1, 11.\n\n[194:16](sbe1448.htm#fr_971) I read with the MSS. of the text \' _k_ atvalad\nahavaniyotkarau.\' The two copies of the commentary give _k_ atvalah\nahavaniyotkarau. Govinda says that the words antare _n_ a tirtham must be\nunderstood. For the position of the _K_ atvala and the Utkara, see Professor\nHaug\'s map, where the road of the priests is also marked, though somewhat\ndifferently.\n\n[195:23](sbe1448.htm#fr_972) For the seats of the priests and the other\npersons named in this and the following rules, see Professor Haug\'s plan, and\nDr. Hillebrandt\'s Altindische Neu and Vollmondopfer, p. 190.\n\n[195:24](sbe1448.htm#fr_973) \'The northern Sro _n_ i of the Vedi, i.e. the\nnorth-western corner of the Vedi.\'--Govinda.\n\n[195:31](sbe1448.htm#fr_974) Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita III, I, 1, 2, where the\nrule also is given. M. alone adds another Sutra, the text of which is corrupt.\nBut it ended with the mantra undatir bala _m_ dhatta, &c. Taitt. S. ibid. 3.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 8, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 16](sbe1449.htm)\n\n'
