'They should proceed with\nthem singly up to the omentum of the Vai _s_ vadeva (victim) 1; and when the\nomentum of the Vai _s_ vadeva has been offered, they should thereupon offer\nthe others,' said Satyakama _G_ abala; 'for, doubtless, the All-Gods (Vi _s_\nve Deva _h_ ) are all (sarve) the gods: it is in this way he gratifies them\ndeity after deity.'\n\n13:5:3:22\\. 'When the omentum of the Aindragna (victim) has been offered, they\nshould thereupon offer the others,' said the two Saumapa Manutantavya;'for,\ndoubtless, Indra and Agni are all the gods: it is in this way he gratifies\nthem deity after deity.'\n\n13:5:3:33\\. 'When the omentum of the (victim) sacred to Ka has been offered,\nthey should thereupon offer\n\np. 393\n\nthe others,' said _S_ ailali; 'for, doubtless, Ka is Pra _g_ apati, and behind\nPra _g_ apati are all the gods: it is in this way he gratifies them deity\nafter deity.'\n\n13:5:3:44\\. 'Having gone through the twenty-one deities of the Seasonal 1\n(victims), let them proceed by dividing (the omenta) into twenty-one parts 2,'\nsaid Bhallaveya; 'for as many as there are Seasonal deities so many are all\nthe gods: it is in this way he gratifies them deity after deity.'\n\n13:5:3:55\\. 'Let them proceed (with the omenta) singly and not otherwise,'\nsaid Indrota Saunaka; 'why, indeed, should they hasten? It is in this way he\ngratifies them deity after deity.' This, then, is what these have said, but\nthe established practice is different therefrom.\n\n13:5:3:66\\. Now Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said, 'They should proceed simultaneously\nwith the (omenta) of Pra _g_ apati's 3 (victims), and simultaneously with\nthose consecrated to single gods: it is in this way that he gratifies them\ndeity after deity, that he goes straightway to the completion of the\nsacrifice, and does not stumble.'\n\n13:5:3:77\\. When the omenta have been offered, the Adhvaryu enters (the\nHavirdhana shed) and draws\n\np. 394\n\n[paragraph continues] Pra _g_ apati's second Mahiman cup of Soma in a silver\nvessel. The Puroru _k_ thereof is (Va _g_. XXIII, 3), 'He who by his greatness\nhath become the one king of the breathing and blinking world, [and who here\nruleth over the two-footed and the four-footed: to the god Ka (Who?) will we\npay homage by offering].' The Anuvakya and Ya _g_ ya are interchanged so as to\n(ensure) unimpaired vigour 1, and the Praisha (direction to Hot _ri_ ) is the\nsame (as that of the first cup). As the Vasha _t_ is uttered, he offers with\n(Va _g_. S. XXIII, 4), 'What greatness of thine there hath been in the night,\nand the year, [what greatness of thine there hath been in the earth and the\nfire; what greatness of thine there hath been in the Nakshatras and the moon,\nto that greatness of thine, to Pra _g_ apati, to the gods, hail 2].' He does\nnot repeat the Vasha _t_ : the significance of this has been explained.\n\n13:5:3:88\\. Of the blood of the other victims they make no sacrificial\nportions; of (that of) the horse they do make portions 3. Of (the blood of)\nthe others they make portions 4 on the south side, of (that of) the horse on\nthe north side (of the altar); of (the blood of) the others he makes portions\non (a mat of) plaksha (ficus infectoria) twigs, of (that of) the horse on\nrattan twigs.\n\np. 395\n\n13:5:3:99\\. But concerning this, Satyaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ i said, 'They may indeed do\nit in either way, only one must not depart from the (right) path.' But the\nformer, indeed, is the established practice. The sacrifice (of the second day)\nis an Ukthya: thereby he causes the air-world to prosper. The last day is an\nAtiratra with all the Stomas, for him to obtain and secure everything, for the\nAtiratra with all the Stomas is everything, and the A _s_ vamedha is\neverything.\n\n13:5:3:1010\\. Its Bahishpavamana (stotra) is in the Triv _ri_ t (9-versed\nStoma), the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya (stotras) in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a (15-versed), the\nMadhyandina-pavamana in the Saptada _s_ a (17), the P _ri_ sh _th_ as in the\nEkavi _m_ _s_ a (21), the T _ri_ tiya Pavamana in the Tri _n_ ava (27), the\nAgnish _t_ oma-saman in the Trayastri _m_ _s_ a (33), the Ukthas in the Ekavi\n_m_ _s_ a (21), the Sho _d_ a _s_ in in the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a, the night\n(chants) in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a, the Sandhi (twilight chant) in the Triv\n_ri_ t (9). Whatever _S_ astra is (recited) for the second day of the P _ri_\nsh _th_ ya Sha _d_ aha that is (used at) the Atiratra sacrifice 1; thereby he\ncauses yonder (heavenly) world to prosper.\n\n13:5:3:1111\\. 'There are twenty-one Savaniya victims, all of them consecrated\nto Agni, and there is one and the same performance for them,' so say some; but\nlet him rather immolate those twenty-four bovine (victims 2) for twelve\ndeities,--twelve months are a year, and the year is everything, and the A _s_\nvamedha\n\np. 396\n\nis everything: thus it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing\neverything.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[392:1](sbe44108.htm#fr_1024) Whilst there are amongst the victims immolated\non the second day, several others consecrated to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ ,\nIndra and Agni, and Ka,--the Vai _s_ vadeva, Aindragna, and Kaya victims,\nreferred to in this and the following two paragraphs, belong to the\nKaturmasya, or Seasonal victims, being amongst those tied to the fourteenth\nand sixteenth stakes. Though the text speaks only of one Vai _s_ vadeva &c.\nvictim, there are really three such victims in each case. According to the\nviews referred to in these paragraphs (cf. comm. on Katy. XX, 7, 23), the\nomenta of all the preceding victims (from the 'parya\xe1\xb9\x85gya' onwards) up to the\nbeginning of the Katurmasyas, would be offered together after (or along with)\nthe vapas of those of the respective victims (Vai _s_ vadeva &c.) specified in\nthese paragraphs; and along therewith the vapas of all the subsequent Seasonal\nvictims. The deities to which this heap of omenta would be offered, would thus\nbe either the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ , or Indra and Agni, or Ka, as representing\nall the deities. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. S. X, 9, 7, assigns the omenta of all the victims,\nexcept the three Pra _g_ apatya ones, to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_.\n\n[393:1](sbe44108.htm#fr_1025) See [p. 309](sbe44087.htm#page_309), note\n[2](sbe44087.htm#fn_787).\n\n[393:2](sbe44108.htm#fr_1026) According to this view, the omenta of all the\nvictims after the three first (Pra _g_ apatya) ones,--i.e. beginning from the\n'parya\xe1\xb9\x85gya' animals (see [p. 299](sbe44084.htm#page_299), note\n[2](sbe44084.htm#fn_755)) up to the end of the _K_ aturmasya, or Seasonal\nvictims, which are the last of the domesticated animals--would be put together\nin one heap and divided into twenty-one portions, which would then be offered\nto the first twenty-one deities of the Seasonal offerings, that is to say, to\nthose of the Vai _s_ vadeva, Varu _n_ apraghasa, Sakamedha, and Mahahavis\nofferings, thus omitting the deities of the Pitryesh _t_ i and the _S_\nunasiriya offerings.\n\n[393:3](sbe44108.htm#fr_1027) That is the first three victims, viz. the horse,\nthe hornless he-goat, and the Gom _ri_ ga.\n\n[394:1](sbe44108.htm#fr_1028) By simple repetition this would be impaired.\n\n[394:2](sbe44108.htm#fr_1029) See [XIII, 2, 11, 2](sbe44093.htm#13:2:11:2)\nwith note.\n\n[394:3](sbe44108.htm#fr_1030) See [XIII, 3, 4,\n2](sbe44097.htm#13:3:4:2)-[5](sbe44097.htm#13:3:4:5).\n\n[394:4](sbe44108.htm#fr_1031) This would be an alternative view. According to\nthe scholl. on Katy. XX, 8, 1-3, this would seem to refer to the other Pra _g_\napatya victims, in which case one would, however, expect the dual here, as\nthere are only two of them besides the horse.\n\n[395:1](sbe44108.htm#fr_1032) In the same way \xc3\x82 _s_ v. S. X, 4, 8 lays down\nthe rule that the _S_ astras of the second day are those of the fifth day of\nthe Vyu _dh_ a P _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha; cf. above, [XIII, 5, 1,\n7](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:7) seqq.\n\n[395:2](sbe44108.htm#fr_1033) See [XIII, 3, 2, 3](sbe44095.htm#13:3:2:3).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 5, 4.
