He hangs a gold plate (round his neck), and wears it; for that gold\nplate is the truth, and the truth is able to sustain that (fire 1): by means\nof the truth the gods carried it, and by means of the truth does he now carry\nit.\n\n6:7:1:22\\. Now that truth is the same as yonder sun. It is a gold (plate), for\ngold is light, and he (the sun) is the light; gold is immortality, and he is\nimmortality. It (the plate) is round, for he (the sun) is round. It has\ntwenty-one knobs, for he is the twenty-first 2. He wears it with the knobs\noutside, for the knobs are his (the sun's) rays, and his rays arc outside.\n\np. 266\n\n6:7:1:33\\. And as to why he puts on and wears the gold plate;--that plate is\nyonder sun, and man, in his human form, is unable to sustain that fire: it is\nonly in this (solar or divine) form that he bears that (divine) form.\n\n6:7:1:44\\. And, again, why he puts on and wears the gold plate;--this fire is\nseed poured out here; and the gold plate means vital energy (or brilliance)\nand vigour: he thus lays vital energy and vigour into that seed.\n\n6:7:1:55\\. And, again, why he puts on and wears the gold plate;--the gods now\nwere afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should destroy here that (Agni) of\ntheirs. They made that (plate), yonder sun, to be his (Agni's) protector\n(standing) by his side, for the gold plate is yonder sun: and in like manner\ndoes this (Sacrificer) now make that (plate) to be his (Agni's) protector by\nhis side.\n\n6:7:1:66\\. It is sown up in a black antelope's skin; for the black antelope\nskin is the sacrifice, and the sacrifice is able to sustain that (Agni): by\nmeans of the sacrifice the gods carried him, and by means of the sacrifice he\nnow carries him;--with the hair (inside), for the hair are the metres, and the\nmetres are indeed able to sustain him: by the metres the gods carried him, and\nby the metres he now carries him.\n\n6:7:1:77\\. It is sown into the white and black hair, for these two are forms\nof the _ri_ _k_ (hymn-verse) and the saman (hymn-tune), and the _ri_ _k_ and\nsaman are indeed able to sustain him (Agni): by the _ri_ _k_ and saman the\ngods carried him, and by the _ri_ _k_ and saman he now carries him. The hempen\nsling of the gold plate is a triple (cord): the significance of this has been\nexplained.\n\np. 267\n\n6:7:1:88\\. He wears it over the navel; for that gold plate is yonder sun, and\nhe (stands) over the navel (of the earth or sky).\n\n6:7:1:99\\. And, again, why over the navel,--below the navel is the seed, the\npower of procreation, and the gold plate represents vital energy and vigour:\n(he does so, thinking,) 'Lest the gold plate burn up my seed, my power of\nprocreation, my vital energy and vigour.'\n\n6:7:1:1010\\. And, again, why over the navel;--sacrificially purer is that part\nof the animal (victim) which is above the navel, and more in contact with\nordure is that which is below the navel: he thus carries it (the plate) by\nmeans of that part of the animal which is sacrificially purer.\n\n6:7:1:1111\\. And, again, why over the navel,--that part of the vital air which\nis immortal is above the navel, and streams out by upward breathings; but that\nwhich is mortal passes by and away from the navel: he thus makes him (the\nSacrificer) obtain the part of the vital air which is immortal, and by that he\nthen carries it (the fire).\n\n6:7:1:1212\\. Now, he carries that (fire in the pan) on a seat;--the seat\n(asandi) doubtless is this earth, for on her everything here is settled\n(asanna); and she indeed is able to sustain him (Agni): it was thereby that\nthe gods carried him, and thereby he now carries him.\n\n6:7:1:1313\\. It is made of udumbara wood (ficus glomerata), for the Udumbara\ntree is sustenance (sustaining strength), life-sap: by means of sustenance,\nlife-sap, he thus carries him. Moreover, that Udumbara represents all the\ntrees here (on earth), and all the trees (together) are capable of sustaining\nthat (fire):\n\np. 268\n\nby means of all the trees the gods bore (or, maintained) it, and by means of\nall the trees does he now bear it.\n\n6:7:1:1414\\. It (the seat) is a span high; for Vish _n_ u, as an embryo, was a\nspan high: he thus makes the womb equal in size to the embryo. It is a cubit\nacross; for the cubit is (the length of) the (fore-)arm, and strength is\nexerted by the arm. It thus is made equal to strength, and strength is indeed\ncapable of sustaining him (Agni): by means of strength the gods did bear him,\nand by means of strength does he now bear him.\n\n6:7:1:1515\\. The feet and boards 1 are four-cornered; for there are four\nregions, and the regions are able to sustain him: by means of the regions the\ngods bore him, and by the regions does he now bear him. It is interwoven with\ncords of reed-grass, triple ones,--the significance of this has been\nexplained;--and smeared over with clay,--(the significance) of this also has\nbeen explained; but it also serves to keep them from taking fire 2.\n\n6:7:1:1616\\. Now he carries him (Agni, the fire) by means of a netting 3\\--he,\nAgni, is these worlds, and the netting is the regions, for by means of the\nregions these worlds are able to stand; and inasmuch as they are so able ( _s_\nak), it is called a netting ( _s_ ikya): he thus carries him by means of the\nregions. It is furnished with six strings,--for there are six\n\np. 269\n\nregions;--made of reed-grass, triply wound--the significance of this has been\nexplained;--and smeared with clay--(the significance) of this also has been\nexplained; but it also serves to keep them from taking fire.\n\n6:7:1:1717\\. The waters are his (Agni's) foundation, for on the waters these\nworlds are founded. The sun is the connecting link 1, for to the sun these\nworlds are linked by means of the quarters: whosoever thus knows this, carries\nsuchlike a one by suchlike a one 2.\n\n6:7:1:1818\\. And, again, why he carries him by means of a netting,--he, Agni,\nis the year, and the netting is the seasons; for by means of the seasons the\nyear is able to exist, and inasmuch as it is so able ( _s_ ak), therefore (the\nnetting is called) ' _s_ ikya:' he thus carries him by the seasons. It is\nfurnished with six strings, for there are six seasons.\n\n6:7:1:1919\\. Day and night are his foundation, for on day and night this year\nis founded. The moon is the connecting link, for to the moon this year is\nlinked by means of the seasons: whosoever thus knows this, carries suchlike a\none by suchlike a one. And verily by him who so knows this, he (Agni) is\ncarried for a year; and by him who does not so know it, he is attended to for\na year 3. Thus as to the deities,--\n\np. 270\n\n6:7:1:2020\\. Now as to the self (or body of Agni). Agni doubtless is the self,\nand the netting is the vital airs, for by means of the vital airs that self is\nable to exist; and inasmuch as it is so able ( _s_ ak) therefore (the netting\nis called) ' _s_ ikya:' he thus carries (sustains) him by means of the vital\nairs; and it is furnished with six strings, because there are six vital airs.\n\n6:7:1:2121\\. The mind is his foundation, for on the mind this body is founded,\n--and food is the connecting link, for to food this body is linked by means of\nthe vital airs: whosoever thus knows this, carries suchlike (Agni) by suchlike\nmeans.\n\n6:7:1:2222\\. Now he carries him by means of the fire-pan; for the pan is these\nworlds, and these worlds are indeed able to hold him: by means of these worlds\nthe gods carried him, and by means of them he (the Sacrificer) now carries\nhim.\n\n6:7:1:2323\\. And as to why it is called 'Ukha;'--by means of this sacred\nperformance and this process the gods at that time dug out these worlds; and\ninasmuch as they so dug out (ut-khan), it (the pan representing the worlds) is\ncalled 'utkha,'--'utkha' being what they mysteriously (esoterically) call\n'ukha,' for the gods love the mysterious.\n\n6:7:1:2424\\. Now 'ukha' (consists of) two syllables,--the Sacrificer is two-\nfooted, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his\nmeasure, by so much he thus carries him. And that same (pan) is a pot\n(kumbhi), it is a cauldron (sthali) 1; this\n\np. 271\n\nmakes six (syllables),--six seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great\nas Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.\n\n6:7:1:2525\\. He now takes hold of him (Agni 1) by means of two (straw) pads 2;\nfor he, Agni, is yonder sun, and the two pads are day and night he thus takes\nhold of yonder sun by means of the day and the night, and hence that (sun) 3\nis encompassed by day and night.\n\n6:7:1:2626\\. And, again, why he takes hold of him by means of two pads,--he,\nAgni, is yonder sun, and the two pads are these two worlds: he thus\nencompasses yonder sun by these two worlds, and hence he is encompassed by\nthese two worlds. They are round, for these two worlds are round; of reed-\ngrass, triply wound,--the significance of this has been told;--and smeared\nwith clay,--(the significance) of this also has been told, but it also serves\nto keep them from taking fire.\n\n6:7:1:2727\\. Now then the (mystic) correspondence (of the number of objects to\nthe nature of Agni),--the seat, the fire-pan, the sling of the gold plate, the\nfire, and the gold plate,--these amount to six;--six seasons are a year, and\nthe year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great\ndoes this become. Two pads, that makes eight,--the Gayatri has eight\nsyllables, and Agni is Gayatra as great as Agni is, as great as is his\nmeasure, so great does this become.\n\np. 272\n\n6:7:1:2828\\. Now the total correspondence,--four feet and four boards (of the\nseat), the netting, and the sling of the gold plate, or any other corded\nnetting; after that the pan and fire, and the gold plate,--that makes\nthirteen;--thirteen months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni\nis, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[265:1](sbe4149.htm#fr_505) That is, the Ukhya Agni, or fire in the pan, which\nthe Sacrificer will have to carry about during his time of initiation; and\nwhich, moreover, is here taken to, be the Sacrificer's divine body ([VI, 6, 4.\n5](sbe4148.htm#6:6:4:5)).\n\n[265:2](sbe4149.htm#fr_506) See I, 3, 5, 12,--twelve months of the year, five\nseasons, and three worlds: this makes twenty; and he that burns yonder is the\ntwenty-first. See also Ait. Br. IV, is, where the sun is identified with the\nEkavi _m_ _s_ a or Vishuvat day, the central day of the year, by which the\ngods raised the sun up to the heavens.\n\n[268:1](sbe4149.htm#fr_507) That is, the boards forming the seat itself; and\nbeing a cubit long.\n\n[268:2](sbe4149.htm#fr_508) Lit. 'from (the fire in the pan) burning over (or\nthrough the clay);' or 'from (their) being burnt over.'\n\n[268:3](sbe4149.htm#fr_509) Apparently a round netted mat, on which the fire-\npan is to be placed, and which is fastened to a cord by means of six strings,\nthus somewhat resembling the scale of a balance.\n\n[269:1](sbe4149.htm#fr_510) Or, the central point, the hinge or hook, to which\nthe worlds are attached.\n\n[269:2](sbe4149.htm#fr_511) Lit. carries that form by that form,--that is to\nsay, he sustains, by means of the sun, the whole world in the form of Agni.\n\n[269:3](sbe4149.htm#fr_512) That is to say, he who desires to derive the full\nbenefit from the initiation ceremony, and the Agni _k_ ayana generally, must\nnot only keep up the Ukhya Agni (or pan-fire) during the year of the\ninitiation, but must also carry him at least for a time every day during that\nperiod.\n\n[270:1](sbe4149.htm#fr_513) These words, according to Saya _n_ a, are merely\nintended as synonymous (paryaya) for 'ukha,' or fire-pan, not as different\nvessels (such as the pot used temporarily when the pan is broken) as one might\nsuppose.\n\n[271:1](sbe4149.htm#fr_514) That is, of the pan containing the fire.\n\n[271:2](sbe4149.htm#fr_515) Saya _n_ a (on [VII, 2, 1,\n15](sbe4157.htm#7:2:1:15)) explains them as two balls of straw. The comparison\nin [26](sbe4149.htm#6:7:1:26) rather points to their being round mats.\n\n[271:3](sbe4149.htm#fr_516) Thus Saya _n_ a. If, on the other hand, Agni be\nintended here, this might be taken as an illusion to the regular worship of\nthe fire at the morning and evening twilights (cf. [VI, 7, 2,\n3](sbe4150.htm#6:7:2:3)).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 7, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe4150.htm)\n\n"
