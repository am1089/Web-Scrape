For the gods, having laid down the\nsecond layer, now ascended it; but, indeed, they thereby completed and\nascended to what is above the earth and below the atmosphere.\n\n8:3:1:22\\. They spate, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed, they meant to say,\n'Seek ye a layer! Seek ye (to build) upwards from hence!' Whilst meditating,\nthey saw the great third layer, even the air: that world pleased them.\n\n8:3:1:33\\. They said to Indra and Agni, 'Lay ye down for us this third\nlayer!'--'What will accrue unto us therefrom? Ye two shall be the best of\nus!'--'So be it!' Accordingly Indra and Agni laid down for them that third\nlayer; and hence people say, 'Indra and Agni are the best of gods.'\n\n8:3:1:44\\. He accordingly lays it down by means of Indra and Agni, and settles\nit by means of Vi _s_ vakarman 4,\n\np. 42\n\nfor indeed Indra and Agni, as well as Vi _s_ vakarman, saw this third layer:\nthis is why he lays it down by means of Indra and Agni, and settles it by\nmeans of Vi _s_ vakarman.\n\n8:3:1:55\\. And, again, as to why he lays it down by means of Indra and Agni,\nand settles it by means of Vi _s_ vakarman. When Pra _g_ apati had become\nrelaxed (disjointed), the deities took him and went off in different\ndirections. Indra and Agni, and Vi _s_ vakarman took his middle part, and kept\ngoing away from him.\n\n8:3:1:66\\. He said to them, 'Come ye to me and restore ye to me wherewith ye\nare going from me!'--'What will accrue unto us therefrom?'--'That (part) of my\nbody shall be sacred unto you!'--'So be it!' So Indra and Agni, and Vi _s_\nvakarman restored that (part) unto him.\n\n8:3:1:77\\. Now that central Svayam-at _ri_ _n_ _n_ a (naturally-perforated\nbrick) 1 is that very (part) of his body;--when he now lays down that (brick),\nhe thereby restores to him that (part) of his (Pra _g_ apati's) body which\nthis (brick represents): this is why he now lays down that (brick).\n\n8:3:1:88\\. [Va _g_. S. XIV, 11], 'O Indra and Agni, make ye fast the brick so\nas not to shake!' as the text so the sense;--'with thy back thou forcest\nasunder the earth, and the sky, and the air;' for with its back this (brick)\nindeed forces asunder the earth, and the sky, and the air.\n\n8:3:1:99\\. [Va _g_. S. XIV, 12], 'May Vi _s_ vakarman settle\n\np. 43\n\nthee,' for Vi _s_ vakarman saw this third layer;--'on the back of the air,\nthee the wide, the broad one!' for this (brick) indeed is the wide and broad\nback of the air;--'support thou the air, make fast the air, injure not the\nair!' that is, 'support thou thine own self (body), make fast thine own self,\ninjure not thine own self!'\n\n8:3:1:1010\\. 'For all up-breathing, and dawn-breathing, and through-breathing,\nand out-breathing!' for the naturally-perforated (brick) is the vital air, and\nthe vital air serves for everything here;--'for a resting-place and moving-\nplace!' for the naturally-perforated (brick) is these worlds, and these worlds\nare indeed a resting-place and a moving-place;--'May Vayu shelter thee!' that\nis, 'May Vayu protect thee!'--'with grand prosperity!' that is, 'with great\nprosperity;'--'with most auspicious protection!'--that is, with what\nprotection is most auspicious.' Having settled it 1, he pronounces the\nSudadohas 2 over it; the meaning of this has been explained. He then sings a\nsaman: the meaning of this (will be explained) further on 3.\n\n8:3:1:1111\\. He then lays down (five) Di _s_ ya (regional bricks) 4. Now the\nregional ones, doubtless, are\n\np. 44\n\nthe regions: it is the regions he thus bestows (on the air-world). And these\nare those same regions not separated (from the air) wherewith Vayu on that\noccasion 1 stepped nigh: it is them he thereby bestows. But prior to these\nsame (bricks) he lays down 2 both the bunch of Darbha grass and the clod-\nbricks; and these (di _s_ yas) being yonder sun 3, he thus places yonder sun\nover the regions, and builds him up upon (or, in) the regions. But were these\n(laid down) at the same time (as the bunch of grass and the clod-bricks), they\nwould be outside (of the altar); and outside of the womb (foundation), indeed,\nis that sacrificial work regarding the fire-altar which is done prior to the\nlotus-leaf 4. When he\n\np. 45\n\nnow brings and lays down these (bricks), he thereby establishes them in the\nwomb, on the lotus-leaf, and thus these (bricks) are not outside (the fire-\naltar). He lays them down so as not to be separated 1 from the naturally-\nperforated one; for the middle 2 naturally-perforated one is the air: he thus\nplaces the regions so as not to be separate from the air. Subsequently 3 (to\nthe central brick he lays them down): subsequently to the air he thus sets up\nthe regions. In all (four) directions he places them: he thus places the\nregions (quarters) in all directions, whence the regions are in all (four)\ndirections. [He places them] on all sides so as to face each other: he thereby\nmakes the regions on all sides face each other, and hence the regions on all\nsides face each other 4.\n\n8:3:1:1212\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the regionals. The regions,\ndoubtless, are the metres--the eastern region being the Gayatri, the southern\nthe Trish _t_ ubh, the western the _G_ agati, the northern the Anush _t_ ubh,\nand the upper region the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti;--and the metres are animals 5, and the\nmiddlemost layer is the air: he thus places animals in the air,\n\np. 46\n\nand hence there are animals that have their abode in the air 1.\n\n8:3:1:1313\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the regionals. The regions,\ndoubtless, are the metres, and the metres are animals, and animals are food,\nand the middlemost layer is the middle: he thus puts food in the middle (of\nthe body). He places them so as not to be separated (by special bricks) from\nthe naturally-perforated one; for the naturally-perforated one is the vital\nair: he thus places the food so as not to be separated from the vital air.\nSubsequently (to the central brick he lays them down): subsequently to (or\nupon) the vital air he thus places food. On the range of the Reta _h_ si _k_\n(he places them): the Reta _h_ si _k_ being the ribs, and the ribs being the\nmiddle (of the body), he thus places the food in the middle of this (Agni's\nbody). On every side he places them: from everywhere he thus supplies him with\nfood.\n\n8:3:1:1414\\. [He lays them down, with, Va _g_. S. XIV, 13], 'Thou art the\nqueen, the Eastern region! Thou art the far-ruler, the Southern region! Thou\nart the all-ruler, the Western region! Thou art the self-ruler, the Northern\nregion! Thou art the supreme ruler, the Great region!' these are their names:\nhe thus lays them down whilst naming them. Separately he lays them down,\nseparately he settles them, and separately he pronounces the Sudadohas over\nthem, for separate are the regions.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[41:4](sbe4311.htm#fr_98) For the connection of these deities with the third\nlayer, and the p. 42 air, see also VI, 2, 3, 3. Vi _s_ vakarman is likewise\nthe deity by which the Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis-brick, representing Vayu (the\nwind), the regent of the air-world, is settled; see [VIII, 3, 2,\n3](sbe4312.htm#8:3:2:3).\n\n[42:1](sbe4311.htm#fr_99) See part iii, p. 155, note 8.\n\n[43:1](sbe4311.htm#fr_100) Viz. by the concluding formula, 'With the help of\nthat deity, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, lie thou steady!' see part iii, p. 302, note 3.\n\n[43:2](sbe4311.htm#fr_101) Viz. Va _g_. S. XII, 55 ( _Ri_ g-veda S. VIII, 69,\n3), 'At his birth the well-like milking, speckled ones mix the Soma, the clans\nof the gods in the three spheres of the heavens.' See part iii, p. 307, note\n2.\n\n[43:3](sbe4311.htm#fr_102) [VIII, 7, 4, 1](sbe4329.htm#8:7:4:1) seq.\n\n[43:4](sbe4311.htm#fr_103) The five Di _s_ yas are placed on the spines in the\nfour directions at the reta _h_ si _k_ range, just over where the five Vai _s_\nvadevi bricks were placed in the second layer (see the sketch, [p.\n24](sbe4307.htm#img_02400)). Between them and the central (naturally-\nperforated) brick there is thus an p. 44 empty space a foot square, and the\ntwo southern Di _s_ yas are half-bricks lying north and south of each other.\n\n[44:1](sbe4311.htm#fr_104) See VI, 2, 3, 4. The second naturally-perforated\nbrick represents the air-world with which Vayu, the wind, is most closely\nassociated.\n\n[44:2](sbe4311.htm#fr_105) That is to say, he laid them down on the site of\nthe altar, before the first layer was commenced, viz. the darbha-bunch in the\ncentre of the 'body' of the altar, where the two spines (anuka) intersect each\nother (VII, 2, 3, 1 seqq.); and the clod-bricks (logesh _t_ aka) on the four\nends of the two spines (VII, 3, 1, 23 seqq.), that is, in the middle of each\nof the four sides of the square of which the body' consists.\n\n[44:3](sbe4311.htm#fr_106) The symbolic interpretation here seems somewhat\nconfused, inasmuch as the Di _s_ yas, which are now apparently identified with\nthe sun, have just been stated to represent the regions. At VI, 7, 1, 17 the\nsun was represented as the central point of the universe to which these three\nworlds are linked by means of the quarters (as by the strings of a scale). The\nclod-bricks, on the other hand, were indeed, in VII, 3, I, 13, identified with\nthe regions (quarters); and the bunch of grass, being laid down in the centre,\nmight be regarded as marking the fifth region, that upwards from here. Cf.\n[IX, 5, 1, 36](sbe4343.htm#9:5:1:36).\n\n[44:4](sbe4311.htm#fr_107) The lotus-leaf is placed in the centre of the altar\nwhen the first layer is about to be laid down. See [VII, 4, 1,\n7](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:7) seqq., where p. 45 it is explained as representing the\nfoundation of the fire-altar, or rather, the womb whence Agni is born.\n\n[45:1](sbe4311.htm#fr_108) That is, not separated therefrom by other special\nbricks; though the full space of one brick is left between the Di _s_ yas and\nthe central brick. Perhaps, however, 'anantarhita' here means 'immediately\nafter.'\n\n[45:2](sbe4311.htm#fr_109) That is, the second of the three svayam-at _ri_ _n_\n_n_ as, the one in the third layer.\n\n[45:3](sbe4311.htm#fr_110) Uttara seems here and elsewhere to have a double\nmeaning, viz. that of subsequent, and upper, or left, inasmuch as looking\ntowards these bricks from the centre of the altar, they are placed to the left\nof the particular section of the anukas.\n\n[45:4](sbe4311.htm#fr_111) See [p. 26](sbe4307.htm#page_26), note\n[3](sbe4307.htm#fn_81).\n\n[45:5](sbe4311.htm#fr_112) The metres are commonly represented as cattle.\n\n[46:1](sbe4311.htm#fr_113) That is all (four-footed) animals that dwell on,\nnot in, the earth. The Gayatri metre, at any rate, is also represented as a\nbird which fetches the Soma from heaven, but it is not the air as such that is\nintended here, but the face of the earth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 3, 2.
