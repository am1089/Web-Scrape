 \nWhither could I, the sinner, turn,  \nHow hope a seat in heaven to earn,  \nIf I my plighted promise break,  \nAnd thus the righteous path forsake?  \nThis world of ours is ever led  \nTo walk the ways which others tread,  \nAnd as their princes they behold,  \nThe subjects too their lives will mould.  \nThat truth and mercy still must be  \nBeloved of kings, is Heaven's decree.  \nUpheld by truth the monarch reigns,  \nAnd truth the very world sustains.  \nTruth evermore has been the love  \nOf holy saints and Gods above,  \nAnd he whose lips are truthful here  \nWins after death the highest sphere.  \nAs from a serpent's deadly tooth,  \nWe shrink from him who scorns the truth.  \nFor holy truth is root and spring  \nOf justice and each holy thing,  \nA might that every power transcends,  \nLinked to high bliss that never ends.  \nTruth is all virtue's surest base,  \nSupreme in worth and first in place.  \nOblations, gifts men offer here,  \nVows, sacrifice, and rites austere,  \nAnd Holy Writ, on truth depend:  \nSo men must still that truth defend.  \nTruth, only truth protects the land,  \nBy truth unharmed our houses stand;  \nNeglect of truth makes men distressed,  \nAnd truth in highest heaven is blessed.  \nThen how can I, rebellious, break  \nCommandments which my father spake--  \nI ever* true and faithful found,  \nAnd by my word of honour bound?  \nMy father's bridge of truth shall stand  \nUnharmed by my destructive hand:  \nNot folly, ignorance, or greed  \nMy darkened soul shall thus mislead.  \nHave we not heard that God and shade  \nTurn from the hated offerings paid  \nBy him whose false and fickle mind  \nNo pledge can hold, no promise bind?  \nTruth is all duty: as the soul,  \nIt quickens and supports the whole.  \nThe good respect this duty: hence  \nIts sacred claims I reverence.  \nThe Warrior's duty I despise  \nThat seeks the wrong in virtue's guise:  \nThose claims I shrink from, which the base,  \nCruel, and covetous embrace.  \nThe heart conceives the guilty thought,  \nThen by the hand the sin is wrought,  \nAnd with the pair is leagued a third,  \nThe tongue that speaks the lying word.  \nFortune and land and name and fame  \nTo man's best care have right and claim;  \nThe good will aye to truth adhere,  \nAnd its high laws must men revere.  \nBase were the deed thy lips would teach,  \nApproved as best by subtle speech.  \nShall I my plighted promise break,  \nThat I these woods my home would make?*  \nShall I, as Bharat's words advise,  \nMy father's solemn charge despise?  \nFirm stands the oath which then before  \nMy father's face I soothly swore,  \nWhich Queen Kaikeyi's anxious ear  \nBejoiced with highest joy to hear.  \nStill in the wood will I remain,  \nWith food prescribed my life sustain,  \nAnd please with fruit and roots and flowers  \nAncestral shades and heavenly powers.  \nHere every sense contented, still  \nHeeding the bounds of good and ill,  \nMy settled course will I pursue,  \nFirm in my faith and ever true.  \nHere in this wild and far retreat  \nWill I my noble task complete;  \nAnd Fire and Wind and *Moon shall be  \nPartakers of its fruit with me.  \nA hundred offerings duly wrought  \nHis rank o'er Gods for Indra bought,  \nAnd mighty saints their heaven secured  \nBy torturing years on earth endured.'  \n   That scoffing plea the hero spurned,  \n     And thus he spake once more,  \n   Chiding, the while his bosom burned,  \n     Javali's impious lore:  \n   'Justice, and courage ne'er dismayed,  \n     Pity for all distressed,  \n   Truth, loving honour duly paid  \n     To Brahman, God, and guest--  \n   In these, the true and virtuous say,  \n     Should lives of men be passed:  \n   They form the right and happy way  \n     That leads to heaven at last.  \n\np. 219  \n\nMy father's thoughtless act I chide  \n   That gave thee honoured place,  \nWhose soul, from virtue turned aside,  \n   Is faithless, dark, and base.  \nWe rank the Buddhist with the thief, [1](ry188.htm#fn_388)  \n   And all the impious crew  \nWho share his sinful disbelief,  \n   And hate the right and true.  \nHence never should wise kings who seek  \n   To rule their people well,  \nAdmit, before their face to speak,  \n   The cursed infidel.  \nBut twice-born men in days gone by,  \n   Of other sort than thou,  \nHave wrought good deeds, whose glories high  \n   Are fresh among us now:  \nThis world they conquered, nor in vain  \n   They strove to win the skies:  \nThe twice-born hence pure lives maintain,  \n   And fires of worship rise.  \nThose who in virtue's path delight,  \n   And with the virtuous live,--  \nWhose flames of holy zeal are bright,  \n   Whose hands are swift to give,  \nWho injure none, and good and mild  \n   In every grace excel,  \nWhose lives by sin are undefiled,  \n   We love and honour well.'  \nThus Rama spoke in righteous rage  \n   *J'av'ali's speech to chide,  \nWhen thus again the virtuous sage  \n   In truthful words replied:  \n'The atheist's lore I use no more,  \n   Not mine his impious creed:  \nHis words and doctrine I abhor,  \n   Assumed at time of need.  \nE'en as I rose to speak with thee,  \n   The fit occasion came  \nThat bade me use the atheist's plea  \n   To turn thee from thine aim.  \nThe atheist creed I disavow,  \n   Unsay the words of sin,  \nAnd use the faithful's language now  \n   Thy favour, Prince, to win.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[217:1](ry186.htm#fr_387) It was the custom of Indian women when mourning for\ntheir absent husbands to bind their hair in a long single braid.\n\nCarey and Marshman translate, 'the one-tailed city,'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto CX.: The Sons of Ikshva'ku.](ry188.htm)\n\n"
