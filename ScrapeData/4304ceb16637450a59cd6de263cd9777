FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.8:1:1\n\n8:1:1:11\\. He lays down the Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ta _h_ (breath-holders) 1: now,\nthe Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ta _h_ being--the vital\n\np. 2\n\nairs, it is the vital airs he thereby bestows upon (Agni). He lays them down\nin the first layer;--that which is the first layer is the forepart (ground-\npart) of Agni: it is thus in front that he puts (into Agni) the vital airs,\nwhence there are (in creatures) these (orifices of the) vital airs in front.\n\np. 3\n\n8:1:1:22\\. He lays them down by ten and ten, for there are ten vital airs; and\neven though 'ten-ten' may mean many, times, here they mean only ten. Five\ntimes he puts on ten (bricks) each time; for it is those five (kinds of\nsacrificial) animals he bestows, and there are ten vital airs in each .animal:\nupon all of them he thus bestows the vital airs. He lays down (the bricks) so\nas not to be separated from the animals: he thus bestows vital airs not\nseparated from the animals. He lays them down on every side: on every side he\nthus bestows on them (orifices of) the vital airs.\n\n8:1:1:33\\. And again why he lays down the Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ta _h_. From Pra\n_g_ apati, when relaxed (by producing creatures), the vital airs departed. To\nthem, having become deities, he spake, 'Come ye to me, return ye unto me that\nwherewith ye have gone out of me!'--'Well then, create thou that food which we\nwill await here looking on!'--'Well then, let us both create!'--'So be it!'--\nSo both the final airs and Pra _g_ apati created that food, these Pra _n_ abh\n_ri_ t (bricks).\n\n8:1:1:44\\. In front (of the altar) he lays down (ten bricks 1,--the first)\nwith (Va _g_. S. XIII, 54), 'This one in front, the Existent,'--in front,\ndoubtless, is Agni; and as to why he speaks of him (as being) 'in front,' it\nis because they take out the fire (from the Garhapatya) towards the front, and\nattend on Agni towards the front 2. And as to why he says 'the\n\np. 4\n\nexistent (bhuva),' Agni is indeed the existent, for it is through Agni that\neverything exists (bhu) here. Agni, indeed, having become the breath, remained\nin front 1: it is that very form 2 he now bestows (on Agni).\n\n8:1:1:55\\. [The others with], 'His, the Existent's son, the Breath,'--from out\nof that form, fire, he (Pra _g_ apati) fashioned the breath;--'Spring, the son\nof the breath,'--from out of the breath he fashioned the spring-season\n3;--'The Gayatri, the daughter of the Spring,'--from out of the spring-season\nhe fashioned the Gayatri metre;--'From the Gayatri the Gayatra,'--from out of\nthe Gayatri metre he fashioned the Gayatra 4 hymn-tune;--'From the Gayatra the\nUpa _m_ _s_ u,'--from out of the Gayatra hymn-tune he fashioned the Upa _m_\n_s_ u-graha 5;--\n\np. 5\n\n[paragraph continues] 'From the Upa _m_ _s_ u the Triv _ri_ t,'--from out of\nthe Upa _m_ _s_ u-graha he fashioned the nine-versed hymn-form;--'From the\nTriv _ri_ t the Rathantara,'--from out of the Triv _ri_ t-stoma he fashioned\nthe Rathantara-p _ri_ sh _th_ a 1.\n\n8:1:1:66\\. 'The _Ri_ shi Vasish _th_ a 2,'--the _Ri_ shi Vasish _th_ a,\ndoubtless, is the breath: inasmuch as it is the chief (thing) therefore it is\nVasish _th_ a (the most excellent); or inasmuch as it abides (with living\nbeings) as the best abider (vast _ri_ ), therefore also it is Vasish _th_\na.--'By thee, taken by Pra _g_ apati,'--that is, 'by thee, created by Pra _g_\napati,'--'I take breath for my descendants (and people)!'--therewith he\nintroduced the breath from the front. Separately he lays down (these ten\nbricks): what separate desires there are in the breath, those he thereby lays\ninto it. Only once he settles them 3: he thereby makes it one breath; but were\nhe to settle them each separately, he assuredly would cut the' breath asunder.\nThis brick is triv _ri_ t (threefold): the formula, the settling, and the\nsudadohas 4, that is threefold, and threefold is Agni,--as great as\n\np. 6\n\n[paragraph continues] Agni is, as great as is his measure, so much he lays\ndown (on the altar) by so dying.\n\n8:1:1:77\\. And on the right (south) side 1 with (Va _g_. S. XIII, 55), 'This\none on the right, the all-worker,'--the all-worker (vi _s_ vakarman),\ndoubtless, is this Vayu (the wind) who blows here, for it is he that makes\neverything here; and because he speaks of him as (being) 'on the right,'\ntherefore it is in the south that he blows most. Vayu, indeed, having become\nthe mind, remained in the right side (of the body): it is that form (part) he\nnow bestows (on Agni).\n\n8:1:1:88\\. 'His, the all-worker's child, the Mind,'--from out of that (all-\nworking) form, the wind, he fashioned the mind;--'the summer, the son of the\nmind,'--from out of the mind he fashioned the summer season 2;--'the Trish _t_\nubh, the daughter of Summer,'--from out of the summer season he fashioned the\nTrish _t_ ubh metre;--'from the Trish _t_ ubh the Svara tune,'--from out of\nthe Trish _t_ ubh metre he created the Svara hymn-tune 3;--'from\n\np. 7\n\nthe Svara the Antaryama,'--from out of the Svara-saman he fashioned the\nAntaryama-graha;--'from the Antaryama the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a,'--from out of\nthe Antaryama-cup he fashioned the fifteen-versed hymn-form;--'from the Pa _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ ada _s_ a the B _ri_ hat,'--from out of the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a-stoma he\nfashioned the B _ri_ hat-p _ri_ sh _th_ a.\n\n8:1:1:99\\. 'The _Ri_ shi Bharadva _g_ a,'--the _Ri_ shi Bharadva _g_ a,\ndoubtless, is the mind;--'va _g_ a' means 'food,' and he who possesses a mind,\npossesses (bharati) food, 'va _g_ a;' therefore the _Ri_ shi Bharadva _g_ a is\nthe mind.--'By thee, taken by Pra _g_ apati,'--that is, 'by thee, created by\nPra _g_ apati;'--'I take the mind for my descendants!'--therewith he\nintroduced the mind from the right side. Separately he lays down (these ten\nbricks): what separate desires there are in the mind, those he thereby lays\ninto it. Only once he settles them: he thereby makes it one mind; but were he\nto settle them each separately,\n\np. 8\n\nhe assuredly would cut asunder the mind. This brick is threefold: the meaning\nof this has been explained.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](sbe4303.htm#fr_34) The construction of the first of the five layers of\nthe altar which, as far as the special bricks are concerned, is now nearing\nits completion, may be briefly recapitulated here. The altar (agni) is\nconstructed in the form of a bird, the body (atman) of which consists of a\nsquare, usually measuring four man's lengths, or forty feet (Indian=c. 30 ft.\nEngl.) on each side. The ground of the 'body' having been ploughed, watered,\nand sown with seeds of all kinds of herbs, a square mound, the so-called\nuttaravedi, measuring a yuga (yoke= 7 ft. Ind.) on each side, is thrown up in\nthe middle of the 'body,' and the whole of the latter then made level with it.\nIn the centre of the 'body' thus raised, where the two 'spines'--connecting\nthe middle of each of the four sides of the square with that of the, opposite\nside--meet, the priest puts down a lotus-leaf, and thereon the gold plate (a\nsymbol of the sun) which the Sacrificer wore round his neck during the time of\ninitiation. On this plate he then lays a small gold figure of a man\n(representing Agni-Pra _g_ apati, as well as the Sacrificer himself), so as to\nlie on his back with the head towards the east; and beside him he places two\noffering-spoons, one on each side, filled with ghee and sour curds p. 2\nrespectively. Upon the man he then places a brick with naturally-formed holes\nin it (or a porous stone), a so-called Svayam-at _ri_ _n_ _n_ a (self-\nperforated one), of which there are three in the altar, viz. in the centre of\nthe first, third, and fifth layers, supposed to represent the earth, air, and\nsky respectively, and by their holes to allow the Sacrificer (in effigy) to\nbreathe, and ultimately to pass through on his way to the eternal abodes. On\nthis stone he lays down a plant of durva grass--with the root lying on the\nbrick, and the twigs hanging down--meant to represent vegetation on earth, and\nfood for the Sacrificer. Thereupon he puts down in front (east) of the central\nstone, on the 'spine,' a Dviya _g_ us brick; in front of that, on both sides\nof the spine, two Reta _h_ si _k_ ; then in front of them, one Vi _s_ va _g_\nyotis; then again two _Ri_ tavya _h_ ; and finally the Asha _dh_ a,\nrepresenting the Sacrificer's consecrated consort. These bricks, each of which\nis a pada (foot, Ind.) square, occupy nearly one-third of the line from the\ncentre to the middle of the front side of the 'body' of the altar. South and\nnorth of the Asha _dh_ a, leaving the space of two bricks, he places a live\ntortoise, facing the gold man, and a wooden mortar and pestle respectively. On\nthe mortar he places the ukha, or fire-pan, filled with sand and milk; and\nthereon the heads of the five victims, after chips of gold have been thrust\ninto their mouths, nostrils, eyes, and ears. At each of the four ends of the\ntwo spines' he then puts down five Apasya _h_ bricks, the middle one lying on\nthe spine itself, with two on each side of it. The last set of five bricks,\nthose hid down at the north (or left) end of the 'cross-spine,' are also\ncalled _Kh_ andasya _h_ by the Brahma _n_ a. He now proceeds to lay down the\nPra _n_ abh _ri_ ta _h_ , meant to represent the orifices of the vital airs,\nin five sets of ten bricks each. The first four sets are placed on the four\ndiagonals connecting the centre with the four corners of the body of the\naltar, beginning from the corner (? or, according to some, optionally from the\ncentre), in the order S.E., N.W., S.W., N.E.; the fifth set being then laid\ndown round the central stone at the distance (or, on the range) of the reta\n_h_ si _k_ bricks. See the diagram at [p. 17](sbe4305.htm#img_01700).\n\n[3:1](sbe4303.htm#fr_35) Whilst standing in front (east) of the altar, he puts\ndown the first set of ten bricks on the line from the south-west corner (or\nright shoulder) of the altar towards the centre. The formulas with which each\nset of ten bricks are deposited are spread over three paragraphs, the first of\nwhich gives that of the first brick, the second those for two to eight, the\nthird for the last two.\n\n[3:2](sbe4303.htm#fr_36) Viz. in taking out the fire from the Garhapatya and\ntransferring p. 4 it to the \xc3\x82havaniya, as well as in approaching the\nsacrificial fire for offerings. It should also be borne in mind that the altar\n(agni) is built in form of an eagle flying towards the east, or front.\n\n[4:1](sbe4303.htm#fr_37) See VII, 5, 1, 7, 'The breath is taken in from the\nfront backwards.'--In the text 'pra _n_ o hagnir bhutva purastat tasthau,' I\ntake 'pra _n_ a _h_ ' to be the predicate.\n\n[4:2](sbe4303.htm#fr_38) At VII, 4, 1, 16, the vital air is called Pra _g_\napati's (Agni's) pleasing form (or part).\n\n[4:3](sbe4303.htm#fr_39) For a similar connection of the East with the\nGayatri, the Rathantara, the Triv _ri_ t, the Spring, and the Brahman\n(priesthood) see V, 4, I, 3, (part iii, p. 91).\n\n[4:4](sbe4303.htm#fr_40) The Gayatra-saman is the simplest, and by far the\nmost common of all hymn-tunes. It is especially used in connection with the\ntriv _ri_ t-stoma, or nine-versed hymn, and is invariably employed for the\nBahishpavamana-stotra. It is also the tune of the first triplet both of the\nMadhyandina and \xc3\x82rbhava-pavamana; as well as for all the four \xc3\x82 _g_ ya-\nstotras.\n\n[4:5](sbe4303.htm#fr_41) See part ii, pp. 238 seqq., where this soma-cup is\nrepeatedly connected with the Gayatri. Though its pressing is performed by\nthree turns of eight, eleven, and twelve beatings respectively, representing\nthe three chief metres, it is expressly stated (IV, 1, 1, 14) p. 5 that he who\nis desirous of obtaining holiness, should press eight times at each turn.\n\n[5:1](sbe4303.htm#fr_42) For this and the other P _ri_ sh _th_ a-samans see\npart iii, introd. pp. xvi, xx seqq.\n\n[5:2](sbe4303.htm#fr_43) In Taitt. S. IV, 3, 2, 1, this formula is connected\nwith the preceding one,--'from the Rathantara (was produced) the _Ri_ shi\nVasish _th_ a.' Similarly in the corresponding passages of the subsequent sets\nof bricks.\n\n[5:3](sbe4303.htm#fr_44) The sadana, or settling, consists in the formula, 'By\nthat deity, A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like, lie thou steady!' being pronounced over the bricks.\nSee VI, 1, 2, 28.\n\n[5:4](sbe4303.htm#fr_45) For the sudadohas verse, the pronunciation of which,\ntogether with the 'settling,' constitutes the two necessary (nitya)\nceremonies, see part iii, p. 307.\n\n[6:1](sbe4303.htm#fr_46) Whilst standing on the right (south) side of the\naltar he lays down the third set of ten Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ta _h_ , viz. those\non the diagonal from the south-west corner (or right thigh) towards the\ncentre. Whilst, in the actual performance, these bricks are only laid down\nafter those referred to in paragraphs 1-3 of the next Brahma _n_ a, the\nauthor, in his explanation of the formulas, follows the course of the sun from\nleft to right.\n\n[6:2](sbe4303.htm#fr_47) For a similar combination of the south with the Trish\n_t_ ubh metre, the B _ri_ hat-saman, the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a-stoma, the\nsummer season, and the Kshatra, see V, 4, 1, 4 (part iii, p. 91).\n\n[6:3](sbe4303.htm#fr_48) Svara-saman is called a chanted verse which has no\nspecial concluding nidhana, or finale, but in which the svarita (circumflex),\nor first rising then falling pitch (e _g_., f-g-f) of the final vowel, takes\nthe place of the finale; whence 'svara' is often explained by 'svaranidhana,'\ni.e. having the svara (svarita) for its nidhana. See p. 7 Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_. Br. IX,\n3, 11, where a svara-saman is prescribed in case the Udgat _ri_ s have\npreviously committed an excess in their chanting. The last tristich of the\nMadhyandina-pavamanastotra of the Agnish _t_ oma, the Au _s_ ana-saman (to\nSama-v., vol. ii, pp. 27-29), is chanted in this way, probably in order to\nmake good the excess committed in the preceding triplet, the Yaudha _g_ aya\n(ii, pp. 25, 26), in which each verse is chanted with three nidhanas, one at\nthe end, and two inserted inside the saman. La _t_ y. _S_ rautas. VI, 9, 6,\nthe svara-samans thus treated are called 'padanusvara _n_ i;' whilst those\nwith which the musical syllables 'ha-i' are used with a similar effect, are\ncalled 'haikarasvara _n_ i.' As an instance of the former, the Au _s_ ana\n(Sama-v., vol. iii, p. 8r) is adduced, and of the latter the Vamadevya (iii,\np. 89). It is not only the final syllable of a saman, however, that may be\nmodulated in this way, but also that of a musical section of the saman; cf. Pa\n_\xc3\xb1_ _k_. Br. X, 12, 2, where the Udgitha is to be so treated to make up for\nthe preceding Prastava, chanted without a Stobha. Sacrificial calls such as\nthe 'Svaha' and 'Vasha _t_ ' are also modulated in this way,' ib. VII, 3, 26;\nXI, 5, 26.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 1, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe4304.htm)\n\n"
