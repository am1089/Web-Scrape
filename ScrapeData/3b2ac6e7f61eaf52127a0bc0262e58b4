Now the one (viz. the \xc3\x82gnidhra) puts the potsherds on (the\nGarhapatya fire); the other (viz. the Adhvaryu) the two mill-stones (on the\nblack antelope skin): these two acts are done simultaneously. The reason why\nthey are done simultaneously (is this):\n\n1:2:1:22\\. The head of this sacrifice is (represented by) the rice-cake 3: for\nthose potsherds (kapala), no doubt, are to this (rice-cake) what the skull\nbones (kapala) are to the head, and the ground rice is\n\np. 33\n\nnothing else than the brain. Now this (combination of skull and brain)\ncertainly forms one limb: \'Let us put that (which is) one together! Let us\nmake it one!\' thus they think; and therefore the two acts are done\nsimultaneously.\n\n1:2:1:33\\. He who puts the potsherds on (the fire), takes the shovelling-stick\n(upavesha), with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 17 a): \'Bold (dh _ri_ sh _t_ i) art\nthou!\' For since with it he, as it were, attacks the fire boldly, therefore it\nis called dh _ri_ sh _t_ i 1. And since with it he touches (the coals) at the\nsacrifice, since with it he attends to (upa-vish) this (Garhapatya fire),\ntherefore it is called upavesha.\n\n1:2:1:44\\. With it he shifts the coals to the fore-part 2 (of the khara or\nhearth-mound), with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 17 b): \'O fire! cast off the fire\nthat eateth raw flesh! drive away the corpse-eating one!\' For the raw flesh-\neating (fire) is the one with which men cook what they eat; and the corpse-\neating one is that on which they burn (the dead) man: these two he thereby\nexpels from it (the Garhapatya).\n\n1:2:1:55\\. He now pulls toward himself 3 one coal, with the text (Va _g_. S.\nI, 17 c): \'Bring hither that (fire) which maketh offerings to the gods!\' He\nthinks: \'On that (fire), which makes offerings to the gods, we\n\np. 34\n\nwill cook the oblations! on that one we will perform the sacrifice!\' and for\nthis reason he pulls (one of the coals) toward himself.\n\n1:2:1:66\\. On it he places the central potsherd 1. For\n\np. 35\n\nthe gods, when they were performing sacrifice, were in fear of a disturbance\nfrom the Asuras and Rakshas. They were afraid lest those evil spirits, the\nRakshas, might rise from below them. Now Agni (fire) is the repeller of the\nRakshas, and for this reason he thus places (the potsherd) on it. The reason\nwhy it is just this (coal) and no other (on which the potsherd is put) is,\nthat this one, having been consecrated by the (above) sacrificial formula, is\nsacrificially pure: that is why he places the central potsherd on it.\n\n1:2:1:77\\. He puts it on, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 17 d): \'Thou art firm;\nmake thou the earth firm!\' For under the form of the earth he renders this\nsame (sacrifice) firm; by it he chases away the spiteful enemy. He adds:\n\'Thee, devoted to the Brahman, devoted to the kshatra, devoted to the\n(sacrificer\'s) kinsmen, I put on for the destruction of the enemy!\' Manifold,\nindeed, are the prayers for blessing in the sacrificial texts (ya _g_ us): by\nthis one he prays for the priestly and military orders, those two towers of\nstrength (vi rye, energies) 1. \'Thee, devoted to the (sacrificer\'s) kinsmen,\'\nhe says, because kinsmen mean wealth, and wealth he thereby prays for. When he\nsays, \'I put thee on for the destruction of the enemy,\' whether or not he\nwishes to exorcise, let him say, \'for the destruction of so\n\np. 36\n\nand so!\' The moment it (the potsherd) has been put down (and while it is still\nbeing touched) with the (fore-)finger of his left hand,--\n\n1:2:1:88\\. He seizes a (second) coal, lest the evil spirits, the Rakshas,\nshould in the meantime rush in here. For the Brahman is the repeller of the\nRakshas 1: hence, the moment it (the potsherd) has been put down (and while it\nis still being touched) with the finger of his left hand,--\n\n1:2:1:99\\. He pushes the coal on it, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 18 a):\n\'Accept, O Agni, this holy work (brahman) 2!\' He says this, lest the evil\nspirits, the Rakshas, should rush in here before; for Agni is the repeller of\nthe Rakshas: this is the reason why he pushes it on (the potsherd).\n\n1:2:1:1010\\. He then puts on that (potsherd) which is (to stand) behind (or\nwest of the first or central one), with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 18 b): \'A\nsupport art thou! make firm the aerial region!\' Under the form of the\natmosphere he makes this (sacrifice) firm; by this he chases away the spiteful\nenemy. He adds: \'Thee, devoted to the brahman, devoted to the kshatra, devoted\nto the (sacrificer\'s) kinsmen, I put on for the destruction of the enemy!\'\n\n1:2:1:1111\\. He then puts on that one which is (to stand) before (i.e. east of\nthe first potsherd), with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 18 c): \'A stay art thou! do\nthou make firm the sky!\' Under the form of the sky he makes this same\n(sacrifice) firm; by it he chases away the spiteful enemy. He adds: \'Thee,\ndevoted to the brahman, devoted to the kshatra, devoted to the kinsmen, I put\non for the destruction of the enemy!\'\n\np. 37\n\n1:2:1:1212\\. He now puts on the one that is (to stand) on the right (i.e.\nsouth of the first), with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 18 d): \'For all the regions\nI put thee on!\' What fourth (world) there is or is not beyond these (three)\nworlds, by that indeed he thereby chases away the spiteful enemy. Uncertain,\nno doubt, is what fourth (world) there is or is not beyond these (three)\nworlds, and uncertain also are all those regions; for this reason he says,\n\'For all the regions I put thee on!\' The remaining potsherds he puts on 1\neither silently, or with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 18 e): \'Layer-forming are ye!\nheap-forming are ye!\'\n\n1:2:1:1313\\. He then covers them over with (hot) coals, whilst muttering the\ntext (Va _g_. S. I, 18 f): \'May ye be heated with the heat of the Bh _ri_ gus\nand\n\np. 38\n\n[paragraph continues] A\xe1\xb9\x85giras 1!\' for it is indeed the brightest light, that\nof the Bh _ri_ gus and A\xe1\xb9\x85giras. He covers them with the view that \'they shall\nbe well heated.\'\n\n1:2:1:1414\\. Now he 2 who puts the two mill-stones on (the black antelope\nskin), (in the first place) takes up the black antelope skin, with the text\n(Va _g_. S. I, 19): \'Bliss-bestowing art thou!\' He shakes it, with the text\n(ib.): \'Shaken off is the Rakshas, shaken off are the enemies!\' the import and\napplication of which is the same (as above, I, 1, 4, 4). He spreads it (on the\nground) with the neck-part turned towards west, whilst muttering the text\n(ib.): \'The skin of Aditi (the inviolate or boundless earth) art thou! May\nAditi acknowledge (receive) thee!\' the import (of this formula) being the same\n(as before, I, 1, 4, 5).\n\n1:2:1:1515\\. He then puts the lower mill-stone on it, with the text (Va _g_.\nS. I, 19): \'A rock-bowl art thou! May the skin of Aditi acknowledge thee!\' for\nit is a bowl (dhisha _n_ a) and a rock too; and by saying, \'May the skin of\nAditi acknowledge thee,\' he establishes an understanding between it and the\nblack antelope skin, so that \'they will not hurt each other.\' This one (the\nlower mill-stone) represents the earth.\n\n1:2:1:1616\\. He now puts upon (the west side of) it the wedge 3 with its point\nturned towards north, whilst\n\np. 39\n\nmuttering the text (Va _g_. S. I, 19): \'The stay of the sky art thou!\' that is\nto say, it represents the atmosphere; for by means of the atmospheric region\nthose two, the sky and the earth, are firmly kept asunder; and for this reason\nhe says, \'The stay of the sky art thou!\'\n\n1:2:1:1717\\. He then puts the upper mill-stone on (the lower one), with the\ntext (Va _g_. S. I, 19): \'A rock-born bowl art thou! May the rock acknowledge\nthee!\' For this one being smaller is, as it were, the daughter (of the lower\nmill-stone) 1; for this reason he calls it \'rock-born.\' \'May the rock\nacknowledge thee!\' he says, because one of the same kin acknowledges (receives\nthe other): thereby he establishes an understanding between those two\nmillstones, thinking \'they will not hurt one another!\' This one, as it were,\nrepresents the sky; (or) the two mill-stones are, as it were, the two jaws,\nand the wedge is the tongue: that is why he beats (the mill-stones) with the\nwedge 2, for it is with the tongue that one speaks.\n\n1:2:1:1818\\. He now pours the rice on (the lower stone), with the text (Va\n_g_. S. I, 20): \'Grain (dhanyam) art thou! do thou gratify (dhi) 3 the gods!\'\nfor it is\n\np. 40\n\ngrain; and it is with the intention \'that it may gratify the gods\' that the\nrice-oblation is taken.\n\n1:2:1:1919\\. He then grinds it, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 20): \'For out-\nbreathing (I grind) thee! for in-breathing thee! for through-breathing\n(pervading vital air) 1 thee! May I impart a long duration to the life (of the\nsacrificer) 2!\' He pours it (the ground rice on the skin), with the text\n(ib.): \'May the divine Savit _ri_ , the golden-handed, receive thee with a\nflawless hand 3!\' \'For his (the sacrificer\'s) eye (I look at) thee 4!\'\n\n1:2:1:2020\\. The reason why he thus grinds it, is that the sacrificial food of\nthe gods is living, is am _ri_ ta (ambrosia, or not dead) for the immortals.\nNow with the mortar and pestle, and with the two millstones they kill this\nrice-offering (havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a).\n\n1:2:1:2121\\. When he now says: \'For out-breathing thee! for in-breathing\nthee!\' he thereby again imparts out-breathing and in-breathing (to it), and by\nsaying \'for through-breathing thee!\' he imparts through-breathing (to it). By\n\'may I impart a long duration to the life!\' he bestows life on it. By \'may the\ndivine Savit _ri_ , the golden-handed, receive thee with a flawless\n\np. 41\n\nhand!\' he says: \'May they be well received!\' By \'for the eye thee!\' he bestows\neye-sight on it. Now these (attributes) are those of a living being; and thus\nthat sacrificial food for the gods is indeed living, is am _ri_ ta (ambrosia,\nor not dead) for the immortals. This is the reason why he thus grinds (the\nrice). (Whilst) they are grinding the (ground) grains 1, (and whilst) they are\nheating the potsherds,--\n\n1:2:1:2222\\. Some one 2 pours clarified butter (into the a _g_ yasthali, or\nbutter-pot). Now whatever oblation, in being taken, is announced to a\n(particular) deity, that belongs to the respective deity, that he takes with a\nspecial prayer; but in taking this oblation, to wit, the butter, he does not\nannounce it to any particular deity, and therefore takes it with an undefined\nformula, viz. with (Va _g_. S. I, 20): \'Juice of the great ones art thou!\' For\n\'the great ones\' some (take to be) a name for the cows; and their juice indeed\nit is: for this reason he says, \'The juice of the great ones art thou!\' And\nthus, moreover, is some of that (butter) taken with a sacrificial formula: and\nfor this reason also he says, \'The juice of the great ones art thou!\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[32:3](sbe1207.htm#fr_142) This idea was no doubt suggested by the derivation\nof the word puro _d_ a _s_ (rice-cake), from puras, \'before, in front, at the\nhead,\' and da _s_ , \'to offer\' (see I; 6, 2, 5 ); the double meaning of kapala\n(shell or cup and skull) being made use of to complete the simile.\n\n[33:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_143) The upavesha, or dh _ri_ sh _t_ i, is made of fresh\nvara _n_ a or pala _s_ a wood, a cubit (aratni) or span (vitasti) long; one of\nits ends having the shape of a hand (hastak _ri_ ti), to serve as a coal\nshovel; cf. Mahidh. and Schol. on Katy. I, 3, 36; II, 4, 26. Dh _ri_ sh _t_ i\nis apparently derived from the root dh _ri_ sh, \'to be bold.\'\n\n[33:2](sbe1207.htm#fr_144) The burning coals have been hitherto lying on the\nwestern side of the Garhapatya hearth, and as this side, which has been well\nheated by this time, will be used for the potsherds to be put on, he shifts\nthe coals to the eastern or fore-part of the hearth.\n\n[33:3](sbe1207.htm#fr_145) Viz. to the centre of the cooking-place.\n\n[34:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_146) In Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ika Deva\'s commentary on Katy. II, 4,\n37, full explanations are given regarding the manner of arranging the\npotsherds (kapalas) on which the sacrificial cakes are spread, and which vary\nin number and shape. The Adhvaryu is first to describe a circle, the diameter\nof which is six a\xe1\xb9\x85gulas (an a\xe1\xb9\x85gula or thumb\'s breadth=about \xc2\xbe inch). This\ncircle he then divides into three parts by drawing across, from west to east,\ntwo parallel lines at a distance of two a\xe1\xb9\x85gulas from one another, so as to\nmake the two outer (or southern and northern) segments of equal size. The\nmiddle division he then covers with three equal square potsherds (measuring\ntwo a\xe1\xb9\x85gulas on each side), by laying down first the central one, then the one\nbehind or west of it, and lastly the front or eastern one. He then lays down\nanother (the fourth) south of the first or central one; after which he divides\nthe still remaining potsherds equally between the southern and the northern\nsegments, or, in case of that number being uneven, assigns the odd potsherd to\nthe southern division. Thus, in the present case, where in the first place a\ncake on eight potsherds is to be offered to Agni; after laying down the three\nintermediate ones and the fourth, or central one of the southern division, he\ndivides the remaining four equally between the southern and northern segments,\nbeginning, in laying them down, in the south-east corner, and moving around\nfrom right to left, so as to end in the north-east. Similarly in the case of\nthe cake on eleven potsherds for Agnishomau, after laying down the first four\npotsherds, he assigns four of the remaining seven to the southern, and three\nto the northern division. Thus with cakes requiring an uneven number of\npotsherds, the number of those of the southern division exceeds that of the\nnorthern one by two; and in the case of an even number, by one only. This is\nthe rule applying to cakes requiring at least six potsherds. When one potsherd\nonly is required, it is to be of the size of a hand; when two, they are to\nform a circle divided into two equal parts by a line drawn from south to\nnorth; when three, the circle is divided into three sections from south to\nnorth; when four or five, it is divided into two halves from west to east; and\nin the one case three potsherds are placed in the southern and one (of half-\nmoon shape) in the northern half; in the other case three in the northern and\ntwo in the southern division. The potsherds, p. 35 though mostly irregular in\nshape, must always exactly fit one another, so as not to leave any space\nbetween. This is effected by rubbing the edges. The cake itself is to be of\nthe shape of a tortoise; the convex shield, or carapace, of the latter\nconsisting of plates arranged in a somewhat similar way as the potsherds of\nmost cakes, viz. in a central (dorsal) and two lateral sets.\n\n[35:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_147) For special prayers for the two highest castes, in\nthe Va _g_ as. Sa _m_ h., cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 27.\n\n[36:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_148) Cf. I, 1, 4, 6.\n\n[36:2](sbe1207.htm#fr_149) Mahidhara admits the alternative interpretation,\n\'Receive (me) the priest!\'\n\n[37:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_150) Viz. dividing them in the manner explained at p.\n34, note 1, and beginning (south)-east, and moving around from left to right\n(i.e. following the course of the sun). Mr. Ralph Griffith (Translation of the\nRamayan, I, p. 90) has compared this Hindu rite of pradakshi _n_ a or dakshi\n_n_ ikara _n_ a with the Gaelic deasil, as described in the following passage\nof Sir W. Scott\'s The Two Drovers: "But it is little I would care for the food\nthat nourishes me, or the fire that warms me, or for God\'s blessed sun itself,\nif aught but weel should happen to the grandson of my father. So let me walk\nthe deasil round you, that you may go safe out into the far foreign land, and\ncome safe home." Robin Oig stopped, half embarrassed, half laughing, and\nsigning to those near that he only complied with the old woman to soothe her\nhumour. In the meantime she traced around him, with wavering steps, the\npropitiation, which some have thought has been derived from the Druidical\nmythology. It consists, as is well known, in the person, who makes the deasil,\nwalking three times round the person who is the object of the ceremony, taking\ncare to move according to the course of the sun.\' Cf. note at [p.\n45](sbe1208.htm#page_45). Note also the etymological connection between dakshi\n_n_ a and deiseil (Old Ir. dessel, from dess, Gael. deas, south or right\nside). For the corresponding rite (dextratio) at the Roman marriage ceremonies\nsee Rossbach, Romische Ehe, pp. 315, 316; Weber, Ind. Stud. V, p. 221.\n\n[38:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_151) The old families of the Bh _ri_ gus and A\xe1\xb9\x85giras are\nfrequently mentioned together, and often also in conjunction with the\nAtharvans: it is indeed to these three families that the native authorities\nattribute the texts and ritual of the Atharva-veda, or fourth Veda, which is\ngenerally referred to in the later Vedic writings under the designation\nAtharva\xe1\xb9\x85girasas. It is probable that the Bh _ri_ gu-A\xe1\xb9\x85giras in the above\nformula of the Va _g_ as. Sa _m_ hita are intended as equivalent to the latter\nterm. Cf. Weber, Omina et Portenta, p. 346.\n\n[38:2](sbe1207.htm#fr_152) Viz. the Adhvaryu; cf. I, 2, 1, 1.\n\n[38:3](sbe1207.htm#fr_153) According to the corresponding rule of Katyayana\n(II, 5, 4) p. 39 and to his commentators (and Mahidhara on Va _g_. S. I, 19)\nand the Black [Ya _g_ ur](errata.htm#4)-veda, he does not lay the wedge on the\nlower millstone, but inserts it under the west or back-part of the stone, so\nas to make the latter incline towards east and to steady it.\n\n[39:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_154) In the Gobhiliya G _ri_ hya-sutra II, 1, 16 the\nupper stone is similarly called \'the son or child\' of the lower one [d _ri_\nshatputra], which the editor, _K_ andrakanta, interprets as \'d _ri_ shad and\nits son;\' or optionally, \'the son of the d _ri_ shad.\' Cf. Weber, Ind. Stud.\nV, p. 305 note.\n\n[39:2](sbe1207.htm#fr_155) See I, 1, 4, 13.\n\n[39:3](sbe1207.htm#fr_156) Mahidhara derives dhanya from the root dhi; and\napparently allows to it here the double meaning \'corn or grain,\' and \'that\nwhich satisfies or pleases.\'\n\n[40:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_157) On the three kinds of breathing, see I, 1, 3, 2-3.\n\n[40:2](sbe1207.htm#fr_158) According to Katyayana (II, 5, 7) and Mahidhara,\nthis last formula (\'May I,\' &c.) should be joined to the one that follows, and\npronounced by the Adhvaryu whilst he pours the ground rice on the skin.\nMahidhara interprets it thus: \'I put thee, (O rice! on the black antelope\nskin) for (increasing) the life (of the sacrificer) with a view to a long\ncontinuance (of the sacrificial work);\' or \'I place thee along the long\nexpanse (i.e. the skin) for thy (the rice\'s) long life!\'\n\n[40:3](sbe1207.htm#fr_159) See I, 1, 4, 23.\n\n[40:4](sbe1207.htm#fr_160) Thus, according to Katy. or Mahidh., whilst he\nlooks at the ground rice on the skin.\n\n[41:1](sbe1207.htm#fr_161) Pi _m_ shanti pish _t_ ani; the grinding of the\nground or grinding of flour (pish _t_ a-pesha _n_ a) is a common expression in\nlater Sanskrit for doing a useless work (\'carrying owls to Athens,\' or coals\nto Newcastle\'). In the present passage, however, the phrase has to be\nunderstood, according to Saya _n_ a, as meaning \'whilst they (the sacrificer\'s\npeople) carry on the work of grinding begun by the Adhvaryu.\'\n\n[41:2](sbe1207.htm#fr_162) The \xc3\x82gnidhra or somebody else, according to Saya\n_n_ a; but according to the Schol. on Katy. II, 5, 9, it is done by the\nsacrificer himself, who thereupon prepares the veda or bunch of sacrificial\ngrass, tied in the middle, and cut straight at each end, and used for\nsweeping, &c. Cf. Katy. I, 3, 21-22; II, 5, 9.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe1208.htm)\n\n'
