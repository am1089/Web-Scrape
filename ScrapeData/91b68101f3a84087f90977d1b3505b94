But with reference to the heart (the highest Self is said to be of the\nsize of a span), as men are entitled (to the study of the Veda).\n\nThe measure of a span is ascribed to the highest Lord, although omnipresent\nwith reference to his abiding within the heart; just as to ether (space) the\nmeasure of a cubit is ascribed with reference to the joint of a bamboo. For,\non the one hand, the measure of a span cannot be ascribed directly to the\nhighest Self which exceeds all measure, and, on the other hand, it has been\nshown that none but the highest Lord can be meant here, on account of the term\n'Lord,' and so on.--But--an objection may be raised--as the size of the heart\nvaries in the different classes of living beings it cannot be maintained that\nthe declaration\n\np. 197\n\nof the highest Self being of the size of a thumb can be explained with\nreference to the heart.--To this objection the second half of the Sutra\nreplies: On account of men (only) being entitled. For the _s_ astra, although\npropounded without distinction (i.e. although not itself specifying what class\nof beings is to proceed according to its precepts), does in reality entitle\nmen 1 only (to act according to its precepts); for men only (of the three\nhigher castes) are, firstly, capable (of complying with the precepts of the\n_s_ astra); are, secondly, desirous (of the results of actions enjoined by the\n_s_ astra); are, thirdly, not excluded by prohibitions; and are, fourthly,\nsubject to the precepts about the upanayana ceremony and so on 2. This point\nhas been explained in the section treating of the definition of adhikara\n(Purva Mim. S. VI, 1).--Now the human body has ordinarily a fixed size, and\nhence the heart also has a fixed size, viz. the size of a thumb. Hence, as men\n(only) are entitled to study and practise the _s_ astra, the highest Self may,\nwith reference to its dwelling in the human heart, be spoken of as being of\nthe size of a thumb.--In reply to the purvapakshin's reasoning that on account\nof the statement of size and on account of Sm _ri_ ti we can understand by him\nwho is of the size of a thumb the transmigrating soul only, we remark that--\nanalogously to such passages as 'That is the Self,' 'That art thou'--our\npassage\n\np. 198\n\nteaches that the transmigrating soul which is of the size of a thumb is (in\nreality) Brahman. For the Vedanta-passages have a twofold purport; some of\nthem aim at setting forth the nature of the highest Self, some at teaching the\nunity of the individual soul with the highest Self. Our passage teaches the\nunity of the individual soul with the highest Self, not the size of anything.\nThis point is made clear further on in the Upanishad, 'The person of the size\nof a thumb, the inner Self, is always settled in the heart of men. Let a man\ndraw that Self forth from his body with steadiness, as one draws the pith from\na reed. Let him know that Self as the Bright, as the Immortal' (II, 6, 17).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[197:1](sbe34094.htm#fr_196) I.e. men belonging to the three upper castes.\n\n[197:2](sbe34094.htm#fr_197) The first reason excludes animals, gods, and _ri_\nshis. Gods cannot themselves perform sacrifices, the essential feature of\nwhich is the parting, on the part of the sacrificer, with an offering meant\nfor the gods. _Ri_ shis cannot perform sacrifices in the course of whose\nperformance the ancestral _ri_ shis of the sacrificer are invoked.--The second\nreason excludes those men whose only desire is emancipation and who therefore\ndo not care for the perishable fruits of sacrifices.--The third and fourth\nreasons exclude the _S_ udras who are indirectly disqualified for _s_ astric\nworks because the Veda in different places gives rules for the three higher\ncastes only, and for whom the ceremony of the upanayana--indispensable for all\nwho wish to study the Veda--is not prescribed.--Cp.
