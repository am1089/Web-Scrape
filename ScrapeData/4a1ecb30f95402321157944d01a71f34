But a few pious S\xcc\x81aivites remained faithful. One of them,\nwhose name means that his heart was laid at S\xcc\x81iva\'s foot, and who lived in the\ntown in the Tanjore District now known as Shiy\xc4\x81li, prayed to the S\xcc\x81iva\nworshipped in the Shiy\xc4\x81li temple that he might be given a son who would dispel\nthe godless dark and win men to Lord S\xcc\x81iva again. Sambandar\'s birth was the\nanswer to that prayer. At the tender age of three, so orthodox S\xcc\x81aivites\nbelieve, this child was fed by Sivas spouse with milk from her divine breast,\nmingled with divine wisdom, whence he is called in his full name, "The man\nconnected with wisdom divine," Tiru J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na Sambandar.\n\nHe grew up to be a pilgrim poet, who visited most of the S\xcc\x81aivite shrines with\nwhich South India abounds, in each place singing the praise of the S\xcc\x81iva whom\nthere he worshipped. The cause he loved suffered a severe blow when the great\nking of Madura, with many of his subjects, went over to the Jain religion. The\nqueen-consort and her prime minister (see stanzas 20 and 21) remained faithful\nto S\xcc\x81aivism, and sent for Sambandar.\n\np. 11\n\n[paragraph continues] The lonely saint faced a vast multitude of Jains in the\nroyal presence, conquered them in argument, and reconverted the king. Eight\nthousand of the stubborn Jains, with Sambandar\'s consent, were impaled alive.\nLater on, after a similar adventure in another of the three great kingdoms of\nthe Tamil country of his time, Sambandar converted to S\xcc\x81aivism a crowd of\nBuddhist opponents.\n\nThis is about all that is known of a man who helped to sing Buddhism right out\nof Southern India, and who composed the collection of hymns which stands first\namong the canonical works of S\xcc\x81aivites. Legends make him a wonder-worker, but\nwe must draw our knowledge of the man from his poems themselves. He certainly\nwas skilful in the handling of the many metres in which Tamil poetry is\nwritten, and it is not impossible that his productions were as effortless as\nthe stories of him tell. That is their weakness, for there is not very much of\nheart religion in them. But they seem to have powerfully helped in that\nprocess of eliminating Jainism and Buddhism from India of which we know so\nlittle, though it was complete enough to be one of the marvels of history.\nTheir author holds the foremost place among the four great \'S\xcc\x81aivite\nPreceptors\' (S\xcc\x81iv\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81ryar), and some call him the incarnation of one of the\nsons of S\xcc\x81iva.\n\nHis date seems to be one of the few clearly established dates in the history\nof the religion of the country. Stanza 19 shews that he was a contemporary of\nanother great early S\xcc\x81aivite, whose name means "Little Servant of God," and\nwho is known to have fought in a battle which took place in 642 A.D.\n\np. 12 p. 13\n\nWe begin with the first verse which the author composed. According to the\nlegends he uttered it at the age of three, on the banks of the temple tank at\nShiy\xc4\x81li (once Bram\xc4\x81puram), after S\xcc\x81iva\'s consort had fed him with milk from\nher own breast. The stanza itself of course contains no allusion to the story,\nbut it is one of the best known verses in the S\xcc\x81aivite hymnbook.\n\n1\\. His ears are beringed, He rideth the bull;  \n  His head is adorned with the crescent moon\'s ray; White is He with ash from\nthe burning-ground swept;  \nAnd He is the thief who my heal t steals away. Great Brahm\xc4\x81 enthroned on the\nlotus\' full bloom  \n  Erstwhile bowed him down and His glory extolled, And singing received he the\ngrace of our lore  \nWho dwelleth in famed Bram\xc4\x81puram old.\n\n* * *\n\nNo pilgrimage in South India is more popular than that to Tiruva\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81malai in\nNorth Arcot, the temple by a hill celebrated in many poems. S\xcc\x81aivism has tried\nto express the existence of the \'eternal feminine\' in deity by giving S\xcc\x81iva a\nlady who not only is His consort, but is actually a part of Him, and is so\nrepresented in many images, which show S\xcc\x81iva as masculine on one side and\nfeminine on the other.\n\n2\\. He is our only Lord, conjoined still  \n  To her whose breast no sucking lips have known.  \nThey who in A\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81malai\'s holy hill,  \n  Where falling waters noisy chatter down,  \nAnd the hill glistens gem-like, bow before  \n  Our great one who is lord and lady too,  \nUnfailingly for them shall be no more  \n  Dread fruit of good and bad deeds they may do.\n\np. 14 p. 15\n\nOne of the first puzzles to a student of S\xcc\x81aivism is the way in which each of\nthe numerous shrines seems to be spoken of as if it were S\xcc\x81iva\'s exclusive\nabode. The broad river marked on English maps as the Cauvery, but in Tamil\ncalled the K\xc4\x81viri, which brings so much blessing to a large part of South\nIndia that the respect in which it is held is not difficult to understand, is\nfringed throughout its length with shrines which are believed to confer the\nblessings of S\xcc\x81iva on all who visit them. One of these is \'Neytt\xc4\x81nam,\' \'Place\nof Ghee.\'\n\n3\\. So ye but say Neytt\xc4\x81nam is the home  \n  Of our great Lord who wears in his long hair  \nThe crescent moon, the river, and the snake,  \n  Neytt\xc4\x81nam where chaste maidens gather fair,  \nOn the north bank of K\xc4\x81viri\'s loud stream,  \n  Your vileness, guiltiness, the sin you dread,  \n  Your sorrows many, shall be banished.\n\n* * *\n\nThis specimen of a hymn connected with Palny in the Madura District alludes\n(in stanza 5) to the well-known legend which says in the S\xcc\x81aivite way that\nthose who love God need not fear death. M\xc4\x81rkandeya was a boy devoted to S\xcc\x81iva,\nbut over his life hung a terrible cloud, for the fates had decreed that he\nwould not live beyond his sixteenth year. As the appointed time drew near his\nfather lived in an agony of dread, but M\xc4\x81rkandeya, free from fear, spent all\nhis time in the worship of S\xcc\x81iva. The god of Death came at last. Regardless of\nthe fact that the boy was at worship he threw over him that noose which pulls\nout human life from the body. The boy clung to S\xcc\x81iva\'s lingam with both his\nhands. From within the lingam S\xcc\x81iva burst forth, kicked the terrible death-god\nand pierced him with his trident. So M\xc4\x81rkandeya was saved. The scene is\nsculptured on many temples.\n\np. 16 p. 17\n\n4\\. Holy Vedas chanting,  \nSacred thread He wears;  \nAll His hosts surround Him  \nWhom the white bull bears.  \nCometh He in splendour,  \nTiger-skin attired.  \n\'Lord, our naked beggar  \nAbove all desired,\'  \nCry ye in your worship,  \nAt His feet appeal.  \nHe who dwells in Palny  \nAll your sin will heal.\n\n5\\. Three eyes hath His forehead,  \nFair moon crowns His hair;  \nWhen Death sought a victim,  \nS\xcc\x81iva\'s foot crashed there;  \nGory streams of blood flowed,  \nDeath it was that died,  \nSuch is He, our Father,  \nUm a, at His side;  \nDwells He aye in Palny,  \nWhere bees hum around  \nDrunk with honeyed sweetness,  \nTill its groves resound.\n\nA multitude of hymns chant the glory of Chidambaram, ancient Tillai, holiest\nof all the S\xcc\x81aivite shrines. Pious S\xcc\x81aivites have for it a feeling not unlike\nthe Jews\' feeling for Jerusalem. The tending of the sacrificial fire comes\ndown from pre-historic times, being firmly established when the earliest hymns\nof the Rig Veda were composed.\n\n6\\. Tending as taught of old the sacrificial fire,  \nAt Tillai Brahmans pure drive out misfortune dire.  \nThere dwells the First of all, moon-crowned, and  \nthose who cleave  \nFor ever to His foot, no cleaving sin will grieve.\n\np. 18 p. 19\n\nConjeeveram, the ancient Tamil name of which is given in this stanza, though\nmore famous as a Vaish\xe1\xb9\x87avite than as a S\xcc\x81aivite shrine, offers in its temples\na remarkable compendium of the religious history of South India. See the\narticle \'K\xc4\x81nchipuram\' in Dr. Hastings\' \'Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics.\'\n\n7\\. He is the pith of holy writ;  \n  And in the tangle of His hair  \nThe spotless crescent\'s ray is lit;  \n  He is both Lord and Lady fair.  \nHe our great sovereign doth abide  \n  In Kachchi Ehambam\'s fair town.  \nMy mind can think of naught beside,  \n  Naught beside Him, and Him alone.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next two stanzas, taken from two separate hymns associated with the great\ncities of Trichinopoly and Madura, both sacred places of S\xcc\x81aivism, are set\nside by side in order to bring out a point which even the most sympathetic\nstudent may not ignore. S\xcc\x81iva is commonly spoken of as all good, as in stanza\n8, and yet not infrequently He includes, as in stanza 9, both good and its\nopposite. The pantheistic tendency even in these hymns causes God to be\nsometimes depicted as so all-embracing as to include evil as well as good.\n\n8\\. All goodness hath He and no shadow of ill.  \n  Grey-white is His bull, fair Um\xc4\x81 shares His form.  \nHis wealth is past searching. Chir\xc4\x81pa\xe1\xb8\xb7\xe1\xb8\xb7i\'s hill  \n  Is His, whom to praise keeps my heart ever warm.\n\n9\\. Thou art right and Thou art wrong,  \n  Lord of holy \xc4\x80lav\xc4\x81y;  \nKinsman, I to Thee belong;  \n  Never fades Thy light away.  \nThou the sense of books divine,  \n  Thou my wealth, my bliss art Thou,  \nThou my all, and in Thy shrine  \n  With what praises can I bow?\n\np. 20 p. 21\n\nNo one can know S\xcc\x81iva unless He chooses to reveal Himself. This thought\nconstantly recurs with great emphasis. Its favourite expression is in the\nfirst legend of the four told in our introduction. Hymn singers are fond of\ncontrasting with the vain search of Brahm\xc4\x81 and Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u the revelation of\nHimself which S\xcc\x81iva has graciously granted to them. Compare stanzas 25 and 48.\n\n10\\. Thou Light whom Brahm\xc4\x81, being\'s fount, and Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u could not see,  \nNo righteousness have I, I only speak in praise of Thee.  \nCome, Valivalam\'s Lord, let no dark fruit of deeds, I pray,  \nTorment Thy slave who with his song extols Thee day by day.\n\n* * *\n\nAstrology plays a large part in popular Hinduism, and the influence of baleful\nor auspicious stars must be reckoned with in daily life. Most baleful of all\nis the influence of the eclipse, which is caused by two dragons R\xc4\x81hu and K\xc4\x93tu\nwhich swallow the moon or the sun. This stanza enumerates the nine planets,\nSun, Moon, Mars, Mercury; Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, R\xc4\x81hu and K\xc4\x93tu, and says that\nto the singer, who has S\xcc\x81iva in his heart, all of them, even the dragons of\neclipse, are auspicious. It is a powerful and characteristically Hindu way of\nsaying that all things work together for good to those who love God.\n\nThe reference to the bamboo constantly recurs in descriptions of ladies\'\nbeauty. Everyone who has seen a feathery clump of bamboo trees waving in the\nbreeze will understand it as a symbol of delicate grace.\n\nThe v\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\x87a is the most delicate and beautiful instrument played in South India.\n\np. 22 p. 23\n\n11\\. She shares His form whose shoulders\' curve vies with the bamboo\'s grace.  \n  His throat the poison drank, He touched the v\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\x87a into tune.  \nThe lustrous moon and Ganges crown His hair, and He a place  \n  Hath made Himself within my heart. Wherefore let shine the moon  \nOr sun or any star of good or ill, or serpents twain.  \nFor S\xcc\x81iva\'s slave all are benign, all work for him great gain.\n\n* * *\n\nWhite ash from burnt cow-dung must be worn by all true S\xcc\x81aivites. Every day\nthe worshipper, facing north-east and crying \'S\xcc\x81iva, S\xcc\x81iva,\' must dip in the\nash the fingers of his right hand and draw the three middle fingers from left\nto right along his forehead, so leaving three horizontal white lines. The\nceremonial side of S\xcc\x81aivism is so prominent that this one stanza must be\ngiven, a specimen of many extolling the virtues and potencies of the ash.\n\nThe Tantras are works inculcating ceremonies, also magic performances and\nmystic rites. Some of these are of an immoral nature.\n\n12\\. The sacred ash has mystic power,  \n\'Tis worn by dwellers in the sky.  \nThe ash bestows true loveliness.  \nPraise of the ash ascends on high.  \nThe ash shows what tile Tantras mean,  \nAnd true religion\'s essence tells,  \nThe ash of Him of \xc4\x80lav\xc4\x81y,  \nIn whom red-lipped Um\xc4\x81 dwells.\n\np. 24 p. 25\n\nEqually important with the wearing of the sacred ash is the constant\nrepetition of the five syllables, or panch\xc4\x81kshara, \'Namas\xcc\x81iv\xc4\x81ya.\' This, which\nmeans literally \'a bow to S\xcc\x81iva,\' is the chief mantra or mystic utterance of\nS\xcc\x81aivism. In S\xcc\x81aivite catechisms a whole chapter is devoted to its uses.\n\n13\\. Those who repeat it while love\'s tears outpour,  \n  It gives them life, and guides them in the way.  \n\'Tis the true substance of the Vedas four,  \n  The Lord\'s great name, wherefore \'Hail S\xcc\x81iva,\' say.\n\n* * *\n\nThe next three stanzas are from a hymn written in a very attractive short-\nlined metre, and promise light, freedom from rebirth, and bliss, through\ndevotion to S\xcc\x81iva at \xc4\x80r\xc5\xabr (now Tiruva\xe1\xb8\xb7\xe1\xb8\xb7\xc5\xabr in the Tanjore District).\n\n14\\. For the Father in \xc4\x80r\xc5\xabr  \n  Sprinkle ye the blooms of love;  \nIn your heart will dawn true light,  \n  Every bondage will remove.\n\n15\\. Him the holy in \xc4\x80r\xc5\xabr  \n  Ne\'er forget to laud and praise;  \nBonds of birth will severed be,  \n  Left behind all worldly ways.\n\n16\\. In \xc4\x80r\xc5\xabr, our loved one\'s gem,  \n  Scatter golden blossoms fair.  \nSorrow ye shall wipe away,  \n  Yours be bliss beyond compare.\n\np. 26 p. 27\n\nAssociated with the hymn from which our next verse is taken is a story of the\nauthor, Sambandar, helping a sorrowing woman by raising to life the man she\nloved, who had been killed by snake-bite. The hymn makes no allusion to such a\nmiracle, but it does give an example of intercession on behalf of another, an\nelement which is somewhat rare in these devotional books.\n\n17\\. Prostrate with fear at Thy feet she cries \'Lord with matted hair, my\nRefuge, Rider of the bull! Lord of Maruhal where fresh water-lilies bloom, is\nit right to leave her in this anguish of heart?\n\n* * *\n\nOur present writer\'s poems contain such frequent denunciations of Buddhism or\nJainism that it is clear that they were written at a time when the struggle\nbetween Hinduism and these other religions was at its height. Buddhism and\nJainism are scarcely known in South India to-day, though at one time they were\nsupreme. It is probable that these songs helped not a little to drive them out\nof the country.\n\n18\\. Those Buddhists and mad Jains may slander speak.  \n    Such speech befits the wand\'rers from the way.  \nBut He who came to earth and begged for alms,  \n    He is the thief who stole my heart away.  \nThe raging elephant charged down at Him;  \n    O marvel! He but took and wore its hide;  \nMadman men think Him, but He is the Lord  \n    Who in great Bram\xc4\x81puram doth abide.\n\np. 28 p. 29\n\nThe "Little Servant of God" mentioned in the next verse is one of the 63\ncanonized saints of S\xcc\x81aivism. According to the collection of legends known as\nthe Periya Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87am, which is a Tamil S\xcc\x81aivite classic, he fought at the battle\nof V\xc4\x81d\xc4\x81pi, the modern Bad\xc4\x81mi, which took place in 642 A.D. There are other\nindications which strengthen the view that these hymns date from the seventh\ncentury A.D.\n\nIn the first three lines of the verse S\xcc\x81iva is conceived as a lover, and the\ndevotee as the woman whom He loves. In India the pain of absence from a lover\nis supposed to cause spots to appear on the skin of the woman who loves.\n\n19\\. Birds in the flowering green-branched pu\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb9\x87ai tree,  \nLove writeth clear its marks on me, for He  \nWho cured my grief, yet left unending pain.  \nSenk\xc4\x81ttanku\xe1\xb8\x8di is His holy fane,  \nAnd there His "Little Servant" dwells, who now  \nAnd ever doth before Lord S\xcc\x81iva bow.  \nThere in the burning-ground, with fire in hand,  \nSporteth unceasingly our Master grand.\n\n* * *\n\nAnother possible indication of date occurs in the next two verses, given in\nEnglish prose because the Tamil names will not fit into English metres. The\nMangaiyarkkarasi here mentioned was the wife of a king of Madura, K\xc5\xabn\nP\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87diyan, known to history. According to the above-mentioned collection of\nstories, this king became a Jain. Then the queen and the prime minister named\nin our poem sent for Sambandar, our author, through whose efforts the king was\nreconverted, and all Jain teachers were executed by impaling. Unfortunately\nthe date of K\xc5\xabn P\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87diyan cannot at present be accurately determined. An able\ndiscussion of it can be seen in "The Tamilian Antiquary, No. 3."\n\np. 30 p. 31\n\nThe explanation of the term \'Fish-eyed maid,\' which sounds curiously in\nEnglish ears, is that in Madura S\xcc\x81iva\'s consort is called M\xc4\xabn\xc4\x81kshi, i.e. fish-\neyed. The suggestion of the epithet, frequently applied to beautiful women, is\nthat the motion of their eyes resembles the beautiful motion of a fish in\nwater.\n\n20\\. This is Alav\xc4\x81y, where dwells the flame-formed lord of hosts, giver of the\nfour Vedas and their meaning, with the fair fish-eyed maid. Here, reigning\nlike the goddess of good fortune, Mangaiyarkkarasi the Ch\xc5\x8dla king\'s daughter,\nbraceletted chaste P\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87diyan queen, daily serves and praises God.\n\n* * *\n\nThe poem from which 20 and 21 are taken consists of stanzas like these\nalternately praising the queen and the king\'s minister, the last verse\npraising them both together.\n\n21\\. This is \xc4\x80lav\xc4\x81y, S\xcc\x81iva\'s abode. To those who forsake the world He reveals\nHimself as world-forsaking too. Head of the heavenly ones, He rides the one\nwhite bull. Praised is He by Kulachchirai, minister of that monarch who wears\nwhite ash, and loves to lay himself bare at the feet of S\xcc\x81iva\'s slaves.\n\n* * *\n\nOnce, says a story, when Sambandar was about to contend with the Jains, the\nqueen feared the consequences which might befal him, but he assured her in\nthis verse that he could dare all when his God of Madura was on his side.\n\np. 32 p. 33\n\n22\\. O fair one with the deer\'s glance meek,  \n  P\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87dya\'s great queen, think not of me  \nAs of some sucking infant weak,  \n  Because such wicked foes there be.  \n    If only Hara by me stand,  \n    Stronger am I than all their band.\n\n* * *\n\nThe story here is that the Janis had set fire to Sambandar\'s house. He prayed\nin this stanza that the fire, transformed into a fever, might go to the\nP\xc4\x81ndyan king, then a Jain. It did so, and the king was converted.\n\n23\\. O Thou whose form is fiery red,  \n  In holy Alav\xc4\x81y, our Sire,  \nIn grace deliver me from dread.  \n  False Jains have lit for me a fire:  \n    O, let it to the P\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8diyan ruler go,  \n    That he the torture of slow flame may know.\n\n* * *\n\nOur specimens of Sambandar\'s poetry may end with a verse which is a kind of\nbenediction, often set as an auspicious word on the front page of a book.\n\n24\\. Blest be the Brahmans pure, the heavenly ones, and kine.  \nCool rain fall on the earth! May the king\'s glory shine!  \nPerish all forms of ill! Let Hara\'s name resound!  \nMay sorrow pass away, from earth\'s remotest bound.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Apparswami and his Hymns](htss04.htm)\n\n'
