(The soul is) a part of the Lord, on account of the declarations of\ndifference, and (because) in a different way also some record that (Brahman)\nis of the nature of slaves, fishers, and so on.\n\nWe have shown that the individual soul and the Lord stand to each other in the\nrelation of what is being acted upon and what is acting upon. This relation is\nobserved in ordinary life to exist only between things connected, such as a\nmaster and a servant, or a fire and its sparks. Now as the soul and the Lord\nalso are acknowledged to stand in the relation of what is acted upon and what\nis acting, a doubt arises whether their connexion is analogous to that of a\nmaster and a servant, or to that of a fire and its sparks.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that either the matter is to be considered as\nundetermined, or that the connexion is like that of master and servant,\nbecause that connexion only is well known to be the relation of ruler (Lord)\nand subject ruled.\n\nTo this the Sutra replies that the soul must be considered a part of the Lord,\njust as a spark is a part of the fire. By 'part' we mean 'a part as it were,'\nsince a being not composed of parts cannot have parts in the literal sense.--\nWhy, then, do we not view the Lord, who is not composed of parts, as identical\nwith the soul?--'On account of the declarations of difference.' For such\nscriptural passages as 'That (self) it is which we must search out, that it is\nwhich we must try to understand' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7);\n\np. 62\n\n[paragraph continues] 'He who knows him becomes a muni' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4,\n22); 'He who dwelling within the Self pulls the Self within' (B _ri_. Up. III,\n7, 23); which all of them refer to a difference (between the highest and the\nindividual Self) would be inappropriate, if there were no difference.--But, it\nmay be said, these statements of difference would agree better with a relation\nsimilar to that of master and servant.--Hence the sutrakara adds, 'and\notherwise also.' That the soul is a part (of the Lord) we learn not only from\nthe passages declaring their difference, but there are other statements also\nwhich teach their non-difference. The members of a certain _s_ akha of the\nAtharva-veda record in a Brahma-sukta that 'Brahman are the fishermen, Brahman\nthe slaves, Brahman these gamblers,' &c. Here low creatures such as fishermen,\nand slaves depending on their masters, and gamblers are called Brahman; whence\nit appears that all individual souls which have entered into aggregates of\neffects and instruments (i.e. bodies) depending on name and form are Brahman.\nThe same view is set forth in other passages such as 'Thou art woman, thou art\nman; thou art youth, thou art maiden; thou as an old man totterest along on\nthy staff, thou art born with thy face turned everywhere' ( _S_ ve. Up. IV,\n3), and 'The wise one who, having produced all forms and made all names, sits\ncalling (the things by their names)' (Taitt. \xc3\x82r. III, 12, 7). Passages such as\n'There is no other seer but he' and other similar ones establish the same\ntruth.--Non-differenced intelligence belongs to the soul and the Lord alike,\nas heat belongs to the sparks as well as the fire.--From these two views of\ndifference and non-difference there results the comprehensive view of the soul\nbeing a part of the Lord.--The following Sutra supplies a further reason.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 44](sbe38045.htm)\n\n"
