Some of them arc, no doubt, quite modern, for\nmention is made even of an Allah-upanishad; but others may claim a far higher\nantiquity than is generally assigned to them on internal evidence. I shall\nonly mention that the name of Atharva _s_ iras, an Upanishad generally\nassigned to a very modern date, is quoted in the Sutras of Gautama and\nBaudhayana 2;\n\np. lxviii\n\nthat the _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad, or the _S_ veta _s_ vatara _n_ am\nMantropanishad, though bearing many notes of later periods of thought, is\nquoted by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara in his commentary on the Vedanta-sutras 1; while the N\n_ri_ si _m_ hottaratapaniya-upanishad forms part of the twelve Upanishads\nexplained by Vidyara _n_ ya in his Sarvopanishad-arthanubhuti-praka _s_ a. The\nUpanishads comprehended in that work are:\n\n1\\. Aitareya-upanishad.  \n2\\. Taittiriya-upanishad.  \n3\\. _Kh_ andogya-upanishad.  \n4\\. Mu _n_ _d_ aka-upanishad.  \n5\\. Pra _s_ na-upanishad.  \n6\\. Kaushitaki-upanishad.  \n7\\. Maitraya _n_ iya-upanishad.  \n8\\. Ka _th_ avalli-upanishad.  \n9\\. _S_ veta _s_ vatara-upanishad.  \n10\\. B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka-upanishad.  \n11\\. Talavakara (Kena)-upanishad.  \n12\\. N _ri_ si _m_ hottaratapaniya-upanishad 2.\n\nThe number of Upanishads translated by Dara Shukoh amounts to 50; their\nnumber, as given in the Mahavakyamuktavali and in the Muktika-upanishad, is\n108 3. Professor Weber thinks that their number, so far as we know at present,\nmay be reckoned at 235 4. In order, however, to arrive at so high a number,\nevery title of an Upanishad would have to be counted separately, while in\nseveral cases it is clearly the same Upanishad which is quoted under different\nnames. In an alphabetical list which I published in 1855 (Zeitschrift der\nDeutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft XIX, 137-158), the number of real\nUpanishads reached 149. To that number Dr. Burnell 5 in his Catalogue\n\np. lxix\n\n[paragraph continues] (p. 59) added 5, Professor Haug (Brahma und die\nBrahmanen) 16, making a sum total of 170. New names, however, are constantly\nbeing added in the catalogues of MSS. published by Buhler, Kielhorn, Burnell,\nRajendralal Mitra, and others, and I shall reserve therefore a more complete\nlist of Upanishads for a later volume.\n\nThough it is easy to see that these Upanishads belong to very different\nperiods of Indian thought, any attempt to fix their relative age seems to me\nfor the present almost hopeless. No one can doubt that the Upanishads which\nhave had a place assigned to them in the Sa _m_ hitas, Brahma _n_ as, and \xc3\x82ra\n_n_ yakas are the oldest. Next to these we can draw a line to include the\nUpanishads clearly referred to in the Vedanta-sutras, or explained and quoted\nby _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, by Saya _n_ a, and other more modern commentators. We can\ndistinguish Upanishads in prose from Upanishads in mixed prose and verse, and\nagain Upanishads in archaic verse from Upanishads in regular and continuous\nAnush _t_ ubh Slokas. We can also class them according to their subjects, and,\nat last, according to the sects to which they belong. But beyond this it is\nhardly safe to venture at present. Attempts have been made by Professor Weber\nand M. Regnaud to fix in each class the relative age of certain Upanishads,\nand I do not deny to their arguments, even where they conflict with each\nother, considerable weight in forming a preliminary judgment. But I know of\nhardy any argument which is really convincing, or which could not be met by\ncounter arguments equally strong. Simplicity may be a sign of antiquity, but\nit is not so always, for what seems simple, may be the result of abbreviation.\nOne Upanishad may give the correct, another an evidently corrupt reading, yet\nit does not follow that the correct reading may not be the result of an\nemendation. It is quite clear that a large mass of traditional Upanishads must\nhave existed before they assumed their present form. Where two or three or\nfour Upanishads contain the same story, told almost in the same words, they\nare not always copied from one another, but they have been settled\nindependently, in different localities, by different teachers, it may be, for\ndifferent purposes.\n\np. lxx\n\n[paragraph continues] Lastly, the influence of _S_ akhas or schools may have\ntold more or less on certain Upanishads. Thus the Maitraya _n_ iya-upanishad,\nas we now possess it, shows a number of irregular forms which even the\ncommentator can account for only as peculiarities of the Maitraya _n_ iya-\nsakha 1. That Upanishad, as it has come down to us, is full of what we should\ncall clear indications of a modern and corrupt age. It contains in VI, 37, a\n_s_ loka from the Manava-dharma- _s_ astra, which startled even the\ncommentator, but is explained away by him as possibly found in another _S_\nakha, and borrowed from there by Manu. It contains corruptions of easy words\nwhich one would have thought must have been familiar to every student. Thus\ninstead of the passage as found in the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad VIII, 7, 1, ya\natmapahatapapma vi _g_ aro vim _ri_ tyur vi _s_ oko 'vi _g_ ighatso 'pipasa\n_h_ , &c., the text of the Maitrayaniya-upanishad (VII, 7) reads,\natmapahatapapma vi _g_ aro vim _ri_ tyur vi _s_ oko 'vi _k_ ikitso 'vipasa\n_h_. But here again the commentator explains that another _S_ akha reads 'vi\n_g_ ighatsa, and that avipa _s_ a is to be explained by means of a change of\nletters as apipasa. Corruptions, therefore, or modern elements which are found\nin one Upanishad, as handed down in one Sakha, do not prove that the same\nexisted in other _S_ akhas, or that they were found in the original text.\n\nAll these questions have to be taken into account before we can venture to\ngive a final judgment on the relative age of Upanishads which belong to one\nand the same class. I know of no problem which offers so many similarities\nwith the one before us as that of the relative age of the four Gospels. All\nthe difficulties which occur in the Upanishads occur here, and no critical\nstudent who knows the difficulties that have to be encountered in determining\nthe relative age of the four Gospels, will feel inclined, in the present state\nof Vedic scholarship, to speak with confidence on the relative age of the\nancient Upanishads.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lxvii:2](sbe01013.htm#fr_31) Gautama, translated by Buhler, Sacred Books of\nthe East, vol. ii, p. 272, and Introduction, p. lvi.\n\n[lxviii:1](sbe01013.htm#fr_32) Vedanta-sutras I, I, II.\n\n[lxviii:2](sbe01013.htm#fr_33) One misses the \xc3\x8e _s_ a or \xc3\x8e _s_ avasya-\nupanishad in this list.
