'The four divine quarters of the heaven, the consorts of Wind, whom the\nsun surveys: to their\n\np. 214\n\nlong life I turn thee; may consumption go away to destruction!'\n\n2. 2 Having placed (him there) he addresses (his wife with the Mantra), 'May no demon do harm to thy son, no cow that rushes upon him (?). Mayst thou become the friend of treasures; mayst thou live in prosperity in thy own way.'\n\n3\\. He washes her right breast and makes her give it to the child with (the\nformula), 'May this boy suckle long life; may he reach old age. Let thy breast\nbe exuberant for him, and life, glory, renown, splendour, strength.'\n\n4\\. In the same way the left breast.\n\n5\\. With (the words), 'He does not suffer, he does not cry, when we speak to\nhim and when we touch him'\xc2\x97he touches both breasts. Then he places a covered\nwater-pot near her head, with (the formula), 'O waters, watch in the house. As\nyou watch with the gods, thus watch over this wife, the mother of a good son.'\n\n6\\. On the twelfth day the mother and the son take a bath.\n\n7\\. They make the house clean.\n\n8. 8 They take the Sutikagni away, and they bring the Aupasana fire.\n\n9\\. Having put wood on that fire, and having performed the rites down to the\nVyah _ri_ ti oblations, they sacrifice twelve oblations with the verses, 'May\nDhat _ri_ give us wealth' (III, 3, II, 2-5); according to some (teachers they\nmake) thirteen (oblations).\n\np. 215\n\n10\\. 'This, O Varu _n_ a' (&c.; see I, chap. 27, Sutra 2, down to): 'Hail!\nGood luck!' Then let him give a name to the child, of two syllables or of four\nsyllables, beginning with a sonant, with a semi-vowel in it, with a long vowel\n(or) the Visarga at its end, or a name that contains the particle su, for such\na name has a firm foundation; thus it is understood.\n\n11. 11 Let the father and the mother pronounce (that name) first. For it is understood, 'My name first, O _G_ atavedas.'\n\n12\\. He should give him two names. For it is understood (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. VI,\n3, I, 3), 'Therefore a Brahma _n_ a who has two names, will have success.'\n\n13. 13 The second name should be a Nakshatra name.\n\n14\\. The one name should be secret; by the other they should call him.\n\n15\\. He should give him the name Somaya _g_ in (i.e. performer of Soma\nsacrifices) as his third name; thus it is understood.\n\n16\\. When he returns from a journey, or when his son returns, he touches him\nwith (the formula), 'With Soma's lustre I touch thee, with Agni's splendour,\nwith the glory of the sun.'\n\n17. 17 With (the formula), 'With the hu _m_ kara (the mystical syllable hu _m_ ) of the cattle I kiss thee, N.N.! For the sake of long life and of glory! Hu _m_!' he\n\np. 216\n\nkisses his head. Then he seizes with his right hand (his son's) right hand\ntogether with the thumb, with the five sections, 'Agni is long-lived.'\n\n18. 18 'May Agni bestow on thee long life everywhere' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. I, 3, 14, 4)\xc2\x97this (verse) he murmurs in (his son's) right ear as above.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[214:2](sbe30076.htm#fr_652) 4, 2.
