XV.\n\nBharata relates the story of Ribhu and Nidagha. The latter, the pupil of the\nformer, becomes a prince, and is visited by his preceptor, who explains to him\nthe principles of unity, and departs.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA continued.--Having terminated these remarks, the Brahman repeated to\nthe silent and meditating prince a tale illustrative of the doctrines of\nunity. "Listen, prince," he proceeded, "to what was formerly uttered by Ribhu,\nimparting holy knowledge to the Brahman Nidagha. Ribhu was a son of the\nsupreme Brahma, who, from his innate disposition, was of a holy character, and\nacquainted with true wisdom. Nidagha, the son of Pulastya, was his disciple;\nand to him Ribhu communicated willingly perfect knowledge, not doubting of his\nbeing fully confirmed in the doctrines of unity, when he had been thus\ninstructed.\n\n"The residence of Pulastya was at Viranagara, a large handsome city on the\nbanks of the Devika river. In a beautiful grove adjoining to the stream the\npupil of Ribhu, Nidagha, conversant with devotional practices, abode. When a\nthousand divine years had elapsed, Ribhu went to the city of Pulastya, to\nvisit his disciple. Standing at the doorway, at the end of a sacrifice to the\nVi\xc5\x9bwadevas, he was seen by his scholar, who hastened to present him the usual\noffering, or Arghya, and conducted him into the house; and when his hands and\nfeet were washed, and he was seated, Nidagha invited him respectfully to eat\n(when the following dialogue ensued):--\n\n" _Ribhu_. \'Tell me, illustrious Brahman, what food there is in your house;\nfor I am not fond of indifferent viands.\'\n\n" _Nid agha_. \'There are cakes of meal, rice, barley, and pulse in the house;\npartake, venerable sir, of whichever best pleases you.\'\n\n" _Ribhu_. \'None of these do I like; give me rice boiled with sugar, wheaten\ncakes, and milk with curds and molasses.\'\n\n" _Nid agha_. \'Ho dame, be quick, and prepare whatever is most delicate and\nsweet in the house, to feed our guest.\'\n\np. 255\n\n"Having thus spoken, the wife of Nidagha, in obedience to her husband\'s\ncommands, prepared sweet and savoury food, and set it before the Brahman; and\nNidagha, having stood before him until he had eaten of the meal which he had\ndesired, thus reverentially addressed him:--\n\n" _Nid agha_. \'Have you eaten sufficiently, and with pleasure, great Brahman?\nand has your mind received contentment from your food? Where is your present\nresidence? whither do you purpose going? and whence, holy sir, have you now\ncome?\'\n\n" _Ribhu_. \'A hungry man, Brahman, must needs be satisfied when he has\nfinished his meal. Why should you inquire if my hunger has been appeased? When\nthe earthy element is parched by fire, then hunger is engendered; and thirst\nis produced when the moisture of the body has been absorbed (by internal or\ndigestive heat). Hunger and thirst are the functions of the body, and\nsatisfaction must always be afforded me by that by which they are removed; for\nwhen hunger is no longer sensible, pleasure and contentment of mind are\nfaculties of the intellect: ask their condition of the mind then, for man is\nnot affected by them. For your three other questions, Where I dwell? Whither I\ngo? and Whence I come? hear this reply. Man (the soul of man) goes every\nwhere, and penetrates every where, like the ether; and is it rational to\ninquire where it is? or whence or whither thou goest? I neither am going nor\ncoming, nor is my dwelling in any one place; nor art thou, thou; nor are\nothers, others; nor am I, I. If you wonder what reply I should make to your\ninquiry why I made any distinction between sweetened and unsweetened food, you\nshall hear my explanation. What is there that is really sweet or not sweet to\none eating a meal? That which is sweet, is no longer so when it occasions the\nsense of repletion; and that which is not sweet, becomes sweet when a man\n(being very hungry) fancies that it is so. What food is there that first,\nmiddle, and last is equally grateful. As a house built of clay is strengthened\nby fresh plaster, so is this earthly body supported by earthly particles; and\nbarley, wheat, pulse, butter, oil, milk, curds, treacle, fruits, and the like,\nare composed of atoms of earth. This therefore is to be understood by you,\nthat the mind which properly judges of what is or is not sweet\n\np. 256\n\nis impressed with the notion of identity, and that this effect of identity\ntends to liberation.\'\n\n"Having heard these words, conveying the substance of ultimate truth, Nidagha\nfell at the feet of his visitor, and said, \'Shew favour unto me, illustrious\nBrahman, and tell me who it is that for my good has come hither, and by whose\nwords the infatuation of my mind is dissipated.\' To this, Ribhu answered, \'I\nam Ribhu, your preceptor, come hither to communicate to you true wisdom; and\nhaving declared to you what that is, I shall depart. Know this whole universe\nto be the one undivided nature of the supreme spirit, entitled Vasudeva.\' Thus\nhaving spoken, and receiving the prostrate homage of Nidagha, rendered with\nfervent faith, Ribhu went his way."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVI](vp074.htm)\n\n'
