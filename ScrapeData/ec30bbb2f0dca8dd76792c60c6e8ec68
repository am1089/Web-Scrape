HOW TO ACHIEVE PAINLESS CHILDBIRTH THROUGH YOGA\n\nTo achieve painless, or "normal," childbirth, Yoga offers exercises and\npostures which will foster healthful development of secreting organs,\nespecially those located within the waist and pelvic zones, and of the\nmuscular and nervous systems.\n\nThe Western fashion world demands that women have thin waists. Actually, a\nwoman requires a larger waist because her liver, stomach, spleen, kidneys,\npancreas and colon are in the waist zone, and are proportionately larger than\nthese organs in the male. This is part of nature\'s provision for motherhood.\nThe fashionable small waist necessarily is accompanied by displaced stomach\nand bowels and perhaps by a dislocated liver and a "floating" kidney.\n\nThe health of the woman\'s internal organs is largely dependent on proper\nnutrition and drainage which eliminates all physiological impurities from the\nbody. Women\'s pelvic organs are often congested. In the case of abdominal\ndisplacement, the pressure of the displaced organs inhibits normal, free flow\nof blood which, in turn, affects the health of\n\np. 91\n\nthe abdominal viscera and the sex organs. Woman is more prone to this\ncombination of unhealthy complications, as her sex organs are within the same\ncavity as the visceral organs.\n\nConstipation is the first evidence of the lack of tonicity of this part of the\nbody. Alleviation, according to Yoga, can come only from full stretching of\nthe anterior and deep muscles. The woman who wants easier childbirth through\nYoga, should keep in mind that these exercises are not the muscle-building\ntype, but specific non-violent and non-fatiguing exercises.\n\n#### Matsyasana, or Fish Pose\n\nA pose especially developed to contribute to the health of the pelvic and sex\norgans, this exercise provides both gentle exercise and a deep internal\nmassage. Sit with your legs fully stretched out and adjust the footlock, as\ndirected for the Semi-Lotus Pose, by folding the legs so that the feet are\nagainst the opposite groins, with the soles turned upward. While inhaling,\nslowly and carefully fall back, using your arms, if necessary, to guide your\nfall. Next, lay supine, with your legs folded, keeping the footlock in place.\nFor comfort in the supine position, you may fold your arms under your head as\na cushion. To complete this _asana_ , return to the starting position while\nexhaling. Try to repeat this exercise about five times a minute. At first work\nat this for about one minute. Later you can extend the time to three minutes.\nThe exercise can be used at all times. However, it should be discontinued\nduring advanced pregnancy.\n\nThe ethical and the Yogic points of view are that in all that concerns sex\nphysiologically, the consummation of the\n\np. 92\n\nideal for woman is motherhood. It has been found in India that those women who\nhave regularly followed Yoga exercises normally enjoy pregnancies which are\nfree of pathological or psychological problems. Childbirth to them is devoid\nof any gruesome experience. The Yoga diet is the most suitable during\npregnancy and the Yoga processes of cleansing and elimination, which have been\ndealt with in other parts of this book, supply the best antitoxic measures.\nHowever, the principles of Yoga are in no way an antithesis to modern\nmedicine. No woman should feel that the practice of Yoga is a substitute for\nprenatal and postnatal care.\n\nPainless childbirth does not mean complete absence of pain. The term, as used\nmedically, means an easy delivery which is quite possible for the great\nmajority of mothers. However, it may be affected by such factors as the pelvic\nconstruction, the form of presentation, etc. Perhaps the greatest factor in\neasy childbirth is the tone and power of contraction of the uterine muscles\nand the abdominal muscles. The groundwork for painless parturition must be\nlaid early in life, and the young girl who begins Yogic exercises soon after\npuberty will be certain to achieve proper development of both the external and\ndeeper muscles. The mature woman may have to work more intensively to correct\nher body tone. Full results may depend on the degree to which the body has\nbeen neglected and the care with which the postures are carried out regularly.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Glossary of Yogic Terms](rwy14.htm)\n\n'
