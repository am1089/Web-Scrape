Before initiation (a child) may follow its inclinations in behaviour,\nspeech, and eating. (It shall) not partake of offerings. (It shall remain)\nchaste. It may void urine and faeces according to its convenience. 1\n\np. 186\n\n2\\. No rule of (purification by) sipping water is prescribed for it. But (the\nstains of impure substances) shall be removed by wiping, by washing, or by\nsprinkling water. 2\n\n3\\. (Other persons) cannot be defiled by the touch of such (a child).\n\n4\\. But one must not employ a (child) to perform oblations in the fire or\nBali-offerings; 4\n\n5\\. Nor must one make it recite Vedic texts, except in pronouncing Svadha. 5\n\n6\\. The restrictive rules, (which will be enumerated hereafter, must be\nobeyed) after initiation,\n\n7\\. And (for a student the duty of) chastity, which has been prescribed (above\nfor a child is likewise obligatory), 7\n\n8\\. (Also) to offer (daily) sacred fuel in the fire, and to beg, to speak the\ntruth, (and) to bathe (daily). 8\n\np. 187\n\n9\\. Some (declare, that the duty) to bathe (exists) after (the performance of)\nthe Godana (only). 9\n\n10\\. And the morning and evening devotions (Sandhya must be performed) outside\n(the village). 10\n\n11\\. Silent he shall stand during the former, and sit during the latter, from\n(the time when one) light (is still visible) until (the other) light\n(appears). 11\n\n12\\. He shall not look at the sun. 12\n\n13\\. He shall avoid honey, meat, perfumes, garlands, sleep in the day-time,\nointments, collyrium, a carriage, shoes, a parasol, love, anger, covetousness,\nperplexity, garrulity, playing musical instruments, bathing (for pleasure),\ncleaning the teeth, elation, dancing, singing, calumny, (and) terror, 13\n\n14\\. (And) in the presence of his Gurus, covering his throat, crossing his\nlegs, leaning (against a wall or the like, and) stretching out his feet, 14\n\n15\\. (As well as) spitting, laughing, yawning, cracking the joints of the\nfingers, 15\n\np. 188\n\n16\\. To gaze at and to touch women, if there is danger of a breach of\nchastity, 16\n\n17\\. Gambling, low service, to take things not offered, to injure animate\nbeings, 17\n\n18\\.

(A student) shall occupy a seat and a couch lower (than those of his\nteacher), shall rise before (him) and retire to rest after (him). 21\n\n22\\. He shall keep his tongue, his arms, and his stomach in subjection. 22\n\n23\\. (If it is absolutely necessary to pronounce), 23\n\np. 189\n\nhis teacher\'s name and family-name, he ought to indicate it by (using) a\nsynonymous term.\n\n24\\. (He must speak) in the same (respectful) manner of a man who is\n(generally) revered and of his betters.\n\n25\\. (If the teacher speaks to him), he shall answer after having risen from\nhis couch or seat (in case he was lying down or sitting). 25\n\n26\\. At the command (of his teacher) he shall approach, though the (teacher)\nmay not be visible. 26\n\n27\\. And if he sees his teacher standing or sitting in a lower place or to the\nleeward or to the windward, he shall rise (and change his position). 27\n\n28\\. If (his teacher) is walking, he shall walk after him, informing him of\nthe work (which he is going to do and) telling (him what he has done). 28\n\n29\\. He shall study after having been called (by the teacher, and not request\nthe latter to begin the lesson). 29\n\np. 190\n\n30\\. He shall be intent on (doing) what is pleasing and serviceable (to the\nteacher). 30\n\n31\\. And (he shall behave) towards (the teacher\'s) wives and sons just as\n(towards the teacher), 31\n\n32\\. But not eat their leavings, attend them while bathing, assist them at\ntheir toilet, wash their feet, shampoo them nor embrace their feet.\n\n33\\. On returning from a journey he shall embrace the feet of the wives of his\nteacher.\n\n34\\. Some declare, that (a pupil) who has attained his majority is not (to act\nthus) towards young (wives of his teacher). 34\n\n35\\. Alms may be accepted from men, of all castes, excepting Abhi _s_ astas\nand outcasts. 35\n\n36\\. (In begging) the word \'Lady\' must be pronounced in the beginning, in the\nmiddle, or at the end (of the request), according to the order of the castes.\n36\n\n37\\. (He may beg in the houses) of the teacher, of blood relations, (or) of\nGurus, and in his own, if he obtains no (alms) elsewhere. 37\n\np. 191\n\n38\\. Among these he shall avoid each preceding one (more carefully than those\nnamed later). 38\n\n39\\. Having announced to the teacher (what he has received) and having\nreceived his permission, the (student) may eat (the collected food). 39\n\n40\\. If (the teacher) is not present, (he shall seek the permission to eat)\nfrom his (teacher\'s) wives or sons, from fellow-students or virtuous\n(strangers). 40\n\n41\\. Having placed water by his side, (he shall eat) in silence, contented,\n(and) without greed. 41\n\n42\\. (As a rule) a pupil shall not be punished corporally. 42\n\n43\\. If no (other course) is possible, (he may be corrected) with a thin rope\nor a thin cane. 43\n\n44\\. If (the teacher) strikes him with any other (instrument), he shall be\npunished by the king.\n\n45\\. He shall remain a student for twelve years in order (to study) one\n(recension of the Veda), 45\n\n46\\. Or, if (he studies) all (the Vedas) twelve years for each,\n\n47\\. Or during (as long a period as he requires for) learning (them).\n\n48\\. On completion of the instruction the teacher must be offered a fee. 48\n\np. 192\n\n49\\. After (the pupil) has paid (that) and has been dismissed, he may, at his\npleasure, bathe (as is customary on completion of the studentship). 49\n\n50\\. The teacher is chief among all Gurus. 50\n\n51\\. Some (say) that the mother (holds that place).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[185:1](sbe0266.htm#fr_848) **II**. In concluding the explanation of this\nSutra, Haradatta states that its last clause is intended to give an instance\nof the freedom of behaviour permitted to a child. In his opinion Gautama\nindicates thereby that a person who, before initiation, drinks spirituous\nliquor, commits murder or other mortal sins, becomes an outcast, and is liable\nto perform the penances prescribed for initiated sinners. In support of this\nview be quotes a passage, taken from an unnamed Sm _ri_ ti, according to which\nthe parents or other relatives of children between five and eleven years are\nto perform penances vicariously for the latter, while children between eleven\nand fifteen years are declared to be liable to half the penances prescribed\nfor initiated adults. Hence he infers that though the above text of Gautama\nspeaks of uninitiated persons in general, its provisions really apply to\nchildren under five years of age only. Though it would seem that some of\nGautama\'s rules refer to half-grown persons rather than to infants or very\nyoung boys, it is impossible to assume that Gautama meant to give full licence\nof behaviour, speech, and eating to Brahma _n_ as who were not p. 186\ninitiated before their sixteenth year, or to Kshatriyas and Vai _s_ yas up to\nthe age of twenty and twenty-two. It seems more likely that, as Haradatta\nthinks, his rules are meant in the first instance for infants and very young\nchildren only, and that he intended the special cases of half-grown or nearly\ngrown up boys to be dealt with according to the custom of the family or of the\ncountry.\n\n[186:2](sbe0266.htm#fr_849) Haradatta points out that the Sutra does not\nforbid uninitiated persons to sip water, but that it merely denies the\napplicability of the rules (kalpa) given above, I, 36. Uninitiated persons\nmay, therefore, sip water in the manner practised by women and _S_ udras.\n\n[186:4](sbe0266.htm#fr_850) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 15, 18; Manu XI, 36.\n\n[186:5](sbe0266.htm#fr_851) \'The expression " pronouncing Svadha" includes by\nimplication the performance of all funeral rites.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[186:7](sbe0266.htm#fr_852) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 26.\n\n[186:8](sbe0266.htm#fr_853) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 4, 14-17; I, 1, 3, 25; I, 2,\n28-30; Manu II, 176.\n\n[187:9](sbe0266.htm#fr_854) Regarding the sacrament called Godana, see Gobhila\nG _ri_ hya-sutra I, 9, 26.\n\n[187:10](sbe0266.htm#fr_855) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 30, 8.\n\n[187:11](sbe0266.htm#fr_856) \'From (the time when one) light (is still\nvisible,\' &c.), i.e. in the morning from the time when the stars are still\nvisible until the sun rises, and in the evening from the time when the sun\nstill stands above the horizon until the stars appear. Haradatta observes p.\n188 that, as Manu II, 102 prescribes the recitation of the Gayatri during the\nmorning and evening devotions, either his or Gautama\'s rule may be followed.\nHe adds that another commentator refers the injunction to keep silence to\nconversations on worldly matters only. He himself has adopted this view in his\ncommentary on \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 30, 8.\n\n[187:12](sbe0266.htm#fr_857) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 31, 18.\n\n[187:13](sbe0266.htm#fr_858) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 23-28; I, 1, 3, 11-14, 20-24;\nI, 2, 7, 5.\n\n[187:14](sbe0266.htm#fr_859) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 6, 3, 14, 17-18.

Haradatta\nobserves that this Sutra again contains a general rule, and does not merely\nrefer to the presence of Gurus.\n\n[188:16](sbe0266.htm#fr_861) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 7, 3, 8-10.\n\n[188:17](sbe0266.htm#fr_862) \xc3\x82pastamba. I, 1, 3, 12. \'"Low service," i.e.\nservice by wiping off urine, faeces, and the like. . . . That is not even to\nbe performed for the teacher. Or the expression may mean that he shall not\nserve a teacher deficient in learning and virtue. The same opinion is\nexpressed by \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, x,11.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[188:18](sbe0266.htm#fr_863) Manu II, 199.\n\n[188:19](sbe0266.htm#fr_864) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 7, 24.\n\n[188:20](sbe0266.htm#fr_865) \'A Brahma _n_ a shall avoid it always, i.e. even\nas a householder; Kshatriyas and Vai _s_ yas need do it only as long as they\nare students. But in their case, too, they forbid the use of, liquor distilled\nfrom bruised rice, under all circumstances.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[188:21](sbe0266.htm#fr_866) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 21; I, 1, 4, 22, 28.\n\n[188:22](sbe0266.htm#fr_867) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 3, 13. \'Keeping his arms in\nsubjection means that he shall not (without a cause) break clods of earth and\nthe like. Keeping his stomach in subjection, i.e. eating with moderation.\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[188:23](sbe0266.htm#fr_868) \'He shall indicate it by another synonymous word,\np. 189 e.g. instead of saying, "Haradatta (given by Hara)," he shall say, the\nvenerable Bhavarata (given by Bhava)."\'--Haradatta.\n\n[189:25](sbe0266.htm#fr_869) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 6, 5-7.\n\n[189:26](sbe0266.htm#fr_870) He must not think that, as the teacher cannot see\nhim, he need not obey the summons.\n\n[189:27](sbe0266.htm#fr_871) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 6, 15, 23.\n\n[189:28](sbe0266.htm#fr_872) \'Work (karma) means performance. The meaning is\nthat the pupil shall announce to his teacher the performance of all he is\ngoing to do. But what is useful for the teacher, as fetching water and the\nlike, be shall inform him of the performance of that, i.e. knowing himself\n(without being told) that such work is necessary at a particular time (and\nacting on this knowledge). Any other explanation of this Sutra does not please\nme.\'--Haradatta. See also \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 6, 8. My MSS. divide this Sutra into\ntwo, beginning the second with \'Informing\' &c. Haradatta\'s final remark,\nquoted above, seems to indicate that the division was intended by him.\n\n[189:29](sbe0266.htm#fr_873) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 5, 26.\n\n[190:30](sbe0266.htm#fr_874) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 4, 23.\n\n[190:31](sbe0266.htm#fr_875) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 7, 27, 30; Manu II, 207-212.\n\n[190:34](sbe0266.htm#fr_876) \'One who has attained his majority, i.e. one who\nhas completed his sixteenth year and is (already) a youth.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[190:35](sbe0266.htm#fr_877) Haradatta explains abhi _s_ asta by upapatakin,\n\'one who has committed a minor offence,\' apparently forgetting \xc3\x82pastamba I, 7,\n21, 7.

Haradatta remarks that the _G_ aimini G _ri_ hya-\nsutra forbids the lengthening or drawling pronunciation of the syllables ksha\n_m_ and hi in begging. Baudhayana I, 2, 3, 16 likewise forbids it. In the text\nread var _n_ anupurvye _n_ a.\n\n[190:37](sbe0266.htm#fr_879) Manu II, 184. It is just possible that the\ntranslation ought to be \'in the houses of his teacher\'s blood relations,\'\ninstead of \'in the houses of his teacher (and) of blood relations.\'\n\n[191:38](sbe0266.htm#fr_880) The meaning of the Sutra is, that if a student\ndoes not obtain anything from strangers, he shall first go to his own family,\nnext to the houses of Gurus, i.e. paternal and maternal uncles and other\nvenerable relatives, then to his other blood relations, i.e. Sapi _n_ _d_ as,\nand in case of extreme necessity only apply to the teacher\'s wife.\n\n[191:39](sbe0266.htm#fr_881) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 3, 31-32.\n\n[191:40](sbe0266.htm#fr_882) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 3, 33-34.\n\n[191:41](sbe0266.htm#fr_883) Manu II, 53-54.\n\n[191:42](sbe0266.htm#fr_884) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 8, 29; Macnaghten, Mitakshara IV,\n1, 9.\n\n[191:43](sbe0266.htm#fr_885) Manu VIII, 299.\n\n[191:45](sbe0266.htm#fr_886)-47. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 12-16.\n\n[191:48](sbe0266.htm#fr_887) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 7, 19.\n\n[192:49](sbe0266.htm#fr_888) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 8, 30.\n\n[192:50](sbe0266.htm#fr_889) Manu II, 225-237.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III](sbe0267.htm)\n\n'
