Here, now, they say, 'To what deity should this victim\nbelong?'--'It should belong to Pra _g_ apati,' they say; 'for it was Pra _g_\napati who first saw it: therefore it is to Pra _g_ apati that this victim\nshould belong.'\n\n11:8:3:22\\. And they also say, 'To Surya (the sun) that victim should belong;'\n--whence it is that cattle are tied up when he (the sun) has set: some of them\n\np. 128\n\nthey tie up 1 in their respective stables, and others just flock\ntogether:--'therefore,' they say, 'it is to Surya that this victim should\nbelong.'\n\n11:8:3:33\\. And they also say, 'To Indra and Agni that victim should belong;\nfor behind these two deities are (all) the other gods;--if one who is\nafflicted sacrifices, those two (gods) sustain him; and if one sacrifices with\n(a desire for) abundance 2, they sustain him: therefore it is to Indra and\nAgni that this victim should belong.'\n\n11:8:3:44\\. The animal sacrifice, indeed, is the breath, whence, as long as\none lives, no other has power over his cattle, for they are tied to him.\n\n11:8:3:55\\. Pra _g_ apati said to Agni, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I\nwill lay hands upon thee (as a victim).'--'Nay,' said he, 'speak unto man!' He\nsaid to man, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon\nthee.'--'Nay,' said he, 'speak unto the cattle!' He said to the cattle, 'I\nwill perform sacrifice with you: I will lay hands upon you.'--'Nay,' said\nthey, 'speak unto the moon!' He said to the moon, 'I will perform sacrifice\nwith thee: I will lay hands upon thee,'--'Nay,' said he, 'speak unto the sun!'\nHe said to the sun, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon\nthee.' 'So be it!' said he; 'but seeing that those liked it not (to be\nslaughtered), what, then, shall become mine that now is with these\n3?'--'Whatsoever\n\np. 129\n\nthou mayest desire,' he said.--'So be it,' he replied. He laid hands upon him,\nand this is that animal of his seized (for sacrifice). When slaughtered, it\nswelled, and by means of those \xc3\x82pri-hymns, he appeased it 1; and inasmuch as,\nby means of these \xc3\x82pri-hymns, he appeased it, they are called \xc3\x82pris. And let\nhim, for that reason, say of the slaughtered animal, 'Let it lie for a\nmoment!' As great as the world is which he gains by performing the horse-\nsacrifice, so great a world does he gain by this (animal sacrifice).\n\n11:8:3:66\\. The (wind of the) eastern region breathed over that (dead victim),\nsaying, 'Breathe forth!' and thereby laid the breath (of the mouth) into it;\nthe southern region breathed over it, saying, 'Breathe through!' and thereby\nlaid the through-breathing into it; the western region breathed over it,\nsaying, 'Breathe off!' and thereby laid the off-breathing into it; the\nnorthern region breathed over it, saying, 'Breathe up!' and thereby laid the\nup-breathing (of the nostrils) into it; the upper region breathed over it,\nsaying, 'Breathe all about!' and thereby laid the circulating breathing into\nit. Therefore, regarding a new-born son, let him say to five Brahma _n_ as,\nbefore the navel-string has been cut, 'Breathe over him in this way 2!' But if\nhe should be unable to obtain them he may even\n\np. 130\n\nhimself breathe over him whilst walking round him; and that (son of his)\nattains the full measure of life 1 and lives to old age.\n\n11:8:3:77\\. He (the sun) took unto himself Agni's breath; whence that (fire)\ndoes not blaze unless fanned or kindled, for its breath has been taken from\nit; and, verily, he who knows this takes away the breath of life from his\nspiteful enemy.\n\n11:8:3:88\\. He took to himself Vayu's form; whence people hear it (the wind),\nas it were, shaking, but do not see it, for its form has been taken from it;\nand, verily, he who knows this takes away the form of his spiteful enemy.\n\n11:8:3:99\\. He took to himself man's thought; whence people say, 'The divine\nthought protect thee, man's thought me!' for his thought has been taken from\nhim; and, verily, he who knows this takes away the thought of his spiteful\nenemy.\n\n11:8:3:1010\\. He took to himself the eye of cattle; whence, even whilst seeing\nclearly, as it were, they do not know anything, but only know what it is when\nthey smell at it, for their eye has been taken from them; and, verily, he who\nknows this takes away the eye of his spiteful enemy.\n\n11:8:3:1111\\. He took to himself the moon's shine; whence of these two (sun\nand moon), though being similar, the moon shines much less, for its shine has\nbeen taken from it; and, verily, he who knows this takes away the shine from\nhis spiteful enemy. And inasmuch as he took these away (a-da), he (the sun) is\ncalled \xc3\x82ditya.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[128:1](sbe44043.htm#fr_395) Or, perhaps, cattle are shut up--some of them\nthey shut up.\n\n[128:2](sbe44043.htm#fr_396) ?
