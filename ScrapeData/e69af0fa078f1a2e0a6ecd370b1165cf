But the declarations (of scripture) are equal (on the other side).\n\nIn reply to the averment made in Sutra 3, we point out that there are\ndeclarations of scripture, of equal weight, in favour of the view that\nknowledge is not complementary to action. For there are scriptural passages\nsuch as, 'Knowing this the _ri_ shis descended from Kavasha said: For what\npurpose should we study the Veda? for what purpose should we sacrifice?\nKnowing this indeed the Ancient ones did not offer the Agnihotra;' and 'When\nBrahma _n_ as know that Self and have risen above the desire for sons, wealth,\nand worlds, they wander about as mendicants' (B _ri_. Up. III, 5). Scripture\nmoreover shows that\n\np. 292\n\n[paragraph continues] Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya and others who knew Brahman did not\ntake their stand on works. 'Thus far goes immortality. Having said so Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya went away into the forest' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15). With reference\nto the indicatory sign (as to the dependence of knowledge to work) which is\nimplied in the passage, 'Sirs, I am going to perform a sacrifice,' we remark\nthat it belongs to a section which treats of Vai _s_ vanara. Now, the text may\ndeclare that a vidya of Brahman as limited by adjuncts is accompanied by\nworks; but all the same the vidya does not stand in a subordinate relation to\nworks since 'leading subject-matter' and the other means of proof are absent.\n\nWe now reply to the averment made in Sutra 4.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 10](sbe38219.htm)\n\n"
