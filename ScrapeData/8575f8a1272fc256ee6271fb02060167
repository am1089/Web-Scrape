On account of the trembling.\n\nIn the part of the Ka _th_ a-Upanishad which intervenes between the passage\n'The Person of the size of a thumb\n\np. 348\n\nstands in the middle of the Self (II, 4, 12), and the passage 'The Person of\nthe size of a thumb, the inner Self' (II, 6, 17), we meet with the text\n'whatever there is, the whole world, when gone forth, trembles in its breath.\nA great terror, a raised thunderbolt; those who knew it became immortal. From\nfear of it fire burns, from fear the sun shines, from fear Indra and Vayu, and\nDeath as the fifth run away' (II, 6, 2; 3). This text declares that the whole\nworld and Agni, Surya, and so on, abiding within that Person of the size of a\nthumb, who is here designated by the term 'breath,' and going forth from him,\ntremble from their great fear of him. 'What will happen to us if we transgress\nhis commandments ?'--thinking thus the whole world trembles on account of\ngreat fear, as if it were a raised thunderbolt. In this explanation we take\nthe clause 'A great fear, a raised thunderbolt,' in the sense of '(the world\ntrembles) from great fear,' &c., as it is clearly connected in meaning with\nthe following clause: 'from fear the fire burns,' &c.--Now what is described\nhere is the nature of the highest Brahman; for that such power belongs to\nBrahman only we know from other texts, viz.: 'By the command of that\nImperishable, O Gargi, sun and moon stand apart' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 9); and\n'From fear of it the wind blows, from fear the sun rises; from fear of it Agni\nand Indra, yea Death runs as the fifth' (Taitt. Up. II, 8, 1).--The next Sutra\nsupplies a further reason.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 41. On account of light being seen](sbe48139.htm)\n\n"
