And as light (assumes forms as it were by its contact with things\npossessing form, so does Brahman;) since (the texts ascribing form to Brahman)\nare not devoid of meaning.\n\nJust as the light of the sun or the moon after having passed through space\nenters into contact with a finger or some other limiting adjunct, and,\naccording as the latter is straight or bent, itself becomes straight or bent\nas it were; so Brahman also assumes, as it were, the form of the earth and the\nother limiting adjuncts with which it enters into connexion. Hence there is no\nreason why certain texts should not teach, with a view to meditative worship,\nthat Brahman has that and that form. We thus escape the conclusion that those\nVedic passages which ascribe form to Brahman are devoid of sense; a conclusion\naltogether unacceptable since all parts of the Veda are equally authoritative,\nand hence must all be assumed to have a meaning.--But does this not imply a\ncontradiction of the tenet maintained above, viz. that Brahman does not\npossess double characteristics although it is connected with limiting\nadjuncts?--By no means, we reply. What is merely due to a limiting adjunct\ncannot constitute an attribute of a substance, and the limiting adjuncts are,\nmoreover, presented by Nescience only. That the primeval natural Nescience\nleaves room for all practical life and activity--whether ordinary or based on\nthe Veda--we have explained more than once.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 16](sbe38119.htm)\n\n'
