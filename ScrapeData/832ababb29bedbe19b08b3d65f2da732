One day as Vasanta, the Spring,\nbegan to assert its reign over the world, animate and inanimate, she went\naccompanied by her young friends and companions to stroll about her father\'s\npleasure-garden.\n\nThe fair troop wandered through sombre groves, where the dark tamale-tree\nentwined its branches with the pale green foliage of the nim, and the pippal\'s\ndomes of quivering leaves contrasted with the columnar aisles of the banyan\nfig. They admired the old monarchs of the forest, bearded to the waist with\nhangings of moss, the flowing creepers delicately climbing from the lower\nbranches to the topmost shoots, and the cordage of llianas stretching from\ntrunk to trunk like bridges for the monkeys to pass over. Then they issued\ninto a clear space dotted with asokas bearing rich crimson fiowers, cliterias\nof azure blue, madhavis exhibiting petals virgin white as the snows on\nHimalaya, and jasmines raining showers of perfumed blossoms upon the grateful\nearth. They could not sufficiently praise the tall and graceful stem of the\narrowy areca, contrasting with the solid pyramid of the cypress, and the more\nmasculine stature of the palm. Now they lingered in the trellised walks\nclosely covered over with vines and creepers; then they stopped to gather the\ngolden bloom weighing down the mango boughs, and to smell the highly-scented\nflowers that hung from the green fretwork of the chambela.\n\nIt was spring, I have said. The air was still except when broken by the hum of\nthe large black bramra bee, as he plied his task amidst the red and orange\nflowers of the dak, and by the gushings of many waters that made music as they\ncoursed down their stuccoed channels between borders of many coloured poppies\nand beds of various flowers. From time to time the dulcet note of the kokila\nbird, and the hoarse plaint of the turtle-dove deep hid in her leafy bower,\nattracted every ear and thrilled every heart. The south wind--"breeze of the\nsouth,[145] the friend of love and spring" blew with a voluptuous warmth, for\nrain clouds canopied the earth, and the breath of the narcissus, the rose, and\nthe citron, teemed with a languid fragrance.\n\nThe charms of the season affected all the damsels. They amused themselves in\ntheir privacy with pelting blossoms at one another, running races down the\nsmooth broad alleys, mounting the silken swings that hung between the orange\ntrees, embracing one another, and at times trying to push the butt of the\nparty into the fishpond. Perhaps the liveliest of all was the lady\nChandraprabha, who on account of her rank could pelt and push all the others,\nwithout fear of being pelted and pushed in return.\n\nIt so happened, before the attendants had had time to secure privacy for the\nprincess and her women, that Manaswi, a very handsome youth, a Brahman\'s son,\nhad wandered without malicious intention into the garden. Fatigued with\nwalking, and finding a cool shady place beneath a tree, he had lain down\nthere, and had gone to sleep, and had not been observed by any of the king\'s\npeople. He was still sleeping when the princess and her companions were\nplaying together.\n\nPresently Chandraprabha, weary of sport, left her friends, and singing a\nlively air, tripped up the stairs leading to the summer-house. Aroused by the\nsound of her advancing footsteps, Manaswi sat up; and the princess, seeing a\nstrange man, started. But their eyes had met, and both were subdued by love--\nlove vulgarly called "love at first sight."\n\n"Nonsense!" exclaimed the warrior king, testily, "I can never believe in that\nfreak of Kama Deva." He spoke feelingly, for the thing had happened to himself\nmore than once, and on no occasion had it turned out well.\n\n"But there is such a thing, O Raja, as love at first sight," objected the\nBaital, speaking dogmatically.\n\n"Then perhaps thou canst account for it, dead one," growled the monarch\nsurlily.\n\n"I have no reason to do so, O Vikram," retorted the Vampire, "when you men\nhave already done it. Listen, then, to the words of the wise. In the olden\ntime, one of your great philosophers invented a fluid pervading all matter,\nstrongly self-repulsive like the steam of a brass pot, and widely spreading\nlike the breath of scandal. The repulsiveness, however, according to that wise\nman, is greatly modified by its second property, namely, an energetic\nattraction or adhesion to all material bodies. Thus every substance contains a\npart, more or less, of this fluid, pervading it throughout, and strongly bound\nto each component atom. He called it \'Ambericity,\' for the best of reasons, as\nit has no connection with amber, and he described it as an imponderable,\nwhich, meaning that it could not be weighed, gives a very accurate and\nsatisfactory idea of its nature.\n\n"Now, said that philosopher, whenever two bodies containing that unweighable\nsubstance in unequal proportions happen to meet, a current of imponderable\npasses from one to the other, producing a kind of attraction, and tending to\nadhere. The operation takes place instantaneously when the force is strong and\nmuch condensed. Thus the vulgar who call things after their effects and not\nfrom their causes, term the action of this imponderable love at first sight;\nthe wise define it to be a phenomenon of ambericity. As regards my own opinion\nabout the matter, I have long ago told it to you, O Vikram! Silliness--"\n\n"Either hold your tongue, fellow, or go on with your story," cried the Raja,\nwearied out by so many words that had no manner of sense.\n\nWell! the effect of the first glance was that Manaswi, the Brahman\'s son, fell\nback in a swoon and remained senseless upon the ground where he had been\nsitting; and the Raja\'s daughter began to tremble upon her feet, and presently\ndropped unconscious upon the floor of the summer-house. Shortly after this she\nwas found by her companions and attendants, who, quickly taking her up in\ntheir arms and supporting her into a litter, conveyed her home.\n\nManaswi, the Brahman\'s son, was so completely overcome, that he lay there dead\nto everything. Just then the learned, deeply read, and purblind Pandits Muldev\nand Shashi by name, strayed into the garden, and stumbled upon the body.\n\n"Friend," said Muldev, "how came this youth thus to fall senseless on the\nground?"\n\n"Man," replied Shashi, "doubtless some damsel has shot forth the arrows of her\nglances from the bow of her eyebrows, and thence he has become insensible!"\n\n"We must lift him up then," said Muldev the benevolent.\n\n"What need is there to raise him?" asked Shashi the misanthrope by way of\nreply.\n\nMuldev, however, would not listen to these words. He ran to the pond hard by,\nsoaked the end of his waistcloth in water, sprinkled it over the young\nBrahman, raised him from the ground, and placed him sitting against the wall.\nAnd perceiving, when he came to himself, that his sickness was rather of the\nsoul than of the body, the old men asked him how he came to be in that plight.\n\n"We should tell our griefs," answered Manaswi, "only to those who will relieve\nus! What is the use of communicating them to those who, when they have heard,\ncannot help us? What is to be gained by the empty pity or by the useless\ncondolence of men in general?"\n\nThe Pandits, however, by friendly looks and words, presently persuaded him to\nbreak silence, when he said, "A certain princess entered this summer-house,\nand from the sight of her I have fallen into this state. If I can obtain her,\nI shall live; if not, I must die."\n\n"Come with me, young man!" said Muldev the benevolent: "I will use every\nendeavour to obtain her, and if I do not succeed I will make thee wealthy and\nindependent of the world."\n\nManaswi rejoined: "The Deity in his beneficence has created many jewels in\nthis world, but the pearl, woman, is chiefest of all; and for her sake only\ndoes man desire wealth. What are riches to one who has abandoned his wife?\nWhat are they who do not possess beautiful wives? they are but beings inferior\nto the beasts! wealth is the fruit of virtue; ease, of wealth; a wife, of\nease. And where no wife is, how can there be happiness?" And the enamoured\nyouth rambled on in this way, curious to us, Raja Vikram, but perhaps natural\nenough in a Brahman\'s son suffering under that endemic malady--determination\nto marry.\n\n"Whatever thou mayest desire," said Muldev, "shall by the blessing of heaven\nbe given to thee."\n\nManaswi implored him, saying most pathetically, \'\'O Pandit, bestow then that\ndamsel upon me!"\n\nMuldev promised to do so, and having comforted the youth, led him to his own\nhouse. Then he welcomed him politely, seated him upon the carpet, and left him\nfor a few minutes, promising him to return. When he reappeared, he held in his\nhand two little balls or pills, and showing them to Manaswi, he explained\ntheir virtues as follows:\n\n"There is in our house an hereditary secret, by means of which I try to\npromote the weal of humanity. But in all cases my success depends mainly upon\nthe purity and the hear/wholeness of those that seek my aid. If thou place\nthis in thy mouth, thou shalt be changed into a damsel twelve years old, and\nwhen thou withdrawest it again, thou shalt again recover shine original form.\nBeware, however, that thou use the power for none but a good purpose;\notherwise some great calamity will befall thee. Therefore, take counsel of\nthyself before undertaking this trial!"\n\nWhat lover, O warrior king Vikram, would have hesitated, under such\ncircumstances, to assure the Pandit that he was the most innocent, earnest,\nand well-intentioned being in the Three Worlds?\n\nThe Brahman\'s son, at least, lost no time in so doing. Hence the simple-minded\nphilosopher put one of the pills into the young man\'s mouth, warning him on no\naccount to swallow it, and took the other into his own mouth. Upon which\nManaswi became a sprightly young maid, and Muldev was changed to a reverend\nand decrepid senior, not fewer than eighty years old.\n\nThus transformed, the twain walked up to the palace of the Raja Subichar, and\nstood for a while to admire the gate. Then passing through seven courts,\nbeautiful as the Paradise of Indra, they entered, unannounced, as became the\npriestly dignity, a hall where, surrounded by his courtiers, sat the ruler.\nThe latter, seeing the Holy Brahman under his roof, rose up, made the\ncustomary humble salutation, and taking their right hands, led what appeared\nto be the father and daughter to appropriate seats. Upon which Muldev, having\nrecited a verse, bestowed upon the Raja a blessing whose beauty has been\ndiffused over all creation.\n\n"May that Deity[146] who as a mannikin deceived the great king Bali; who as a\nhero, with a monkey-host, bridged the Salt Sea; who as a shepherd lifted up\nthe mountain Gobarddhan in the palm of his hand, and by it saved the cowherds\nand cowherdesses from the thunders of heaven--may that Deity be thy\nprotector!"\n\nHaving heard and marvelled at this display of eloquence, the Raja inquired,\n"Whence hath your holiness come?"\n\n"My country," replied Muldev, "is on the northern side of the great mother\nGanges, and there too my dwelling is. I travelled to a distant land, and\nhaving found in this maiden a worthy wife for my son, I straightway returned\nhomewards. Meanwhile a famine had laid waste our village, and my wife and my\nson have fled I know not where. Encumbered with this damsel, how can I wander\nabout seeking them? Hearing the name of a pious and generous ruler, I said to\nmyself, \' I will leave her under his charge until my return.\' Be pleased to\ntake great care of her."\n\nFor a minute the Raja sat thoughtful and silent. He was highly pleased with\nthe Brahman\'s perfect compliment. But he could not hide from himself that he\nwas placed between two difficulties: one, the charge of a beautiful young\ngirl, with pouting lips, soft speech, and roguish eyes; the other, a priestly\ncurse upon himself and his kingdom. He thought, however, refusal the more\ndangerous; so he raised his face and exclaimed, "O produce of Brahma\'s\nhead,[147] I will do what your highness has desired of me."\n\nUpon which the Brahman, after delivering a benediction of adieu almost as\nbeautiful and spirit-stirring as that with which he had presented himself,\ntook the betel[148] and went his ways.\n\nThen the Raja sent for his daughter Chandraprabha and said to her, "This is\nthe affianced bride of a young Brahman, and she has been trusted to my\nprotection for a time by her father-in-law. Take her therefore into the inner\nrooms, treat her with the utmost regard, and never allow her to be separated\nfrom thee, day or night, asleep or awake, eating or drinking, at home or\nabroad."\n\nChandraprabha took the hand of Sita--as Manaswi had pleased to call himself--\nand led the way to her own apartment. Once the seat of joy and pleasure, the\nrooms now wore a desolate and melancholy look. The windows were darkened, the\nattendants moved noiselessly over the carpets, as if their footsteps would\ncause headache, and there was a faint scent of some drug much used in cases of\ndeliquium. The apartments were handsome, but the only ornament in the room\nwhere they sat was a large bunch of withered flowers in an arched recess, and\nthese, though possibly interesting to some one, were not likely to find favour\nas a decoration in the eyes of everybody.\n\nThe Raja\'s daughter paid the greatest attention and talked with unusual\nvivacity to the Brahman\'s daughter-in-law, either because she had roguish\neyes, or from some presentiment of what was to occur, whichever you please,\nRaja Vikram, and it is no matter which. Still Sita could not help perceiving\nthat there was a shade of sorrow upon the forehead of her fair new friend, and\nso when they retired to rest she asked the cause of it.\n\nThen Chandraprabha related to her the sad tale: "One day in the spring season,\nas I was strolling in the garden along with my companions, I beheld a very\nhandsome Brahman, and our eyes having met, he became unconscious, and I also\nwas insensible. My companions seeing my condition, brought me home, and\ntherefore I know neither his name nor his abode. His beautiful form is\nimpressed upon my memory. I have now no desire to eat or to drink, and from\nthis distress my colour has become pale and my body is thus emaciated." And\nthe beautiful princess sighed a sigh that was musical and melancholy, and\nconcluded by predicting for herself--as persons similarly placed often do--a\nsudden and untimely end about the beginning of the next month.\n\n"What wilt thou give me," asked the Brahman\'s daughter-in-law demurely, "if I\nshow thee thy beloved at this very moment?"\n\nThe Raja\'s daughter answered, "I will ever be the lowest of thy slaves,\nstanding before thee with joined hands."\n\nUpon which Sita removed the pill from her mouth, and instantly having become\nManaswi, put it carefully away in a little bag hung round his neck. At this\nsight Chandraprabha felt abashed, and hung down her head in beautiful\nconfusion. To describe--\n\n"I will have no descriptions, Vampire!" cried the great Vikram, jerking the\nbag up and down as if he were sweating gold in it. "The fewer of thy\ndescriptions the better for us all."\n\nBriefly (resumed the demon), Manaswi reflected upon the eight forms of\nmarriage--viz., Bramhalagan, when a girl is given to a Brahman, or man of\nsuperior caste, without reward; Daiva, when she is presented as a gift or fee\nto the officiating priest at the close of a sacrifice; Arsha, when two cows\nare received by the girl\'s father in exchange for the bride[149]; Prajapatya,\nwhen the girl is given at the request of a Brahman, and the father says to his\ndaughter and her to betrothed, "Go, fulfil the duties of religion"; Asura,\nwhen money is received by the father in exchange for the bride; Rakshasha,\nwhen she is captured in war, or when her bridegroom overcomes his rival;\nPaisacha, when the girl is taken away from her father\'s house by craft; and\neighthly, Gandharva-lagan, or the marriage that takes place by mutual\nconsent.[150]\n\nManaswi preferred the latter, especially as by her rank and age the princess\nwas entitled to call upon her father for the Lakshmi Swayambara wedding, in\nwhich she would have chosen her own husband. And thus it is that Rama, Arjuna,\nKrishna, Nala, and others, were proposed to by the princesses whom they\nmarried.\n\nFor five months after these nuptials, Manaswi never stirred out of the palace,\nbut remained there by day a woman, and a man by night. The consequence was\nthat he--I call him "he," for whether Manaswi or Sita, his mind ever remained\nmasculine--presently found himself in a fair way to become a father.\n\nNow, one would imagine that a change of sex every twenty-four hours would be\nvariety enough to satisfy even a man. Manaswi, however, was not contented. He\nbegan to pine for more liberty, and to find fault with his wife for not taking\nhim out into the world. And you might have supposed that a young person who,\nfrom love at first sight, had fallen senseless upon the steps of a summer-\nhouse, and who had devoted herself to a sudden and untimely end because she\nwas separated from her lover, would have repressed her yawns and little\nirritable words even for a year after having converted him into a husband. But\nno! Chandraprabha soon felt as tired of seeing Manaswi and nothing but\nManaswi, as Manaswi was weary of seeing Chandraprabha and nothing but\nChandraprabha. Often she had been on the point of proposing visits and out-of-\ndoor excursions. But when at last the idea was first suggested by her husband,\nshe at once became an injured woman. She hinted how foolish it was for married\npeople to imprison themselves and to quarrel all day. When Manaswi\nremonstrated, saying that he wanted nothing better than to appear before the\nworld with her as his wife, but that he really did not know what her father\nmight do to him, she threw out a cutting sarcasm upon his effeminate\nappearance during the hours of light. She then told him of an unfortunate\nyoung woman in an old nursery tale who had unconsciously married a fiend that\nbecame a fine handsome man at night when no eye could see him, and utter\nugliness by day when good looks show to advantage. And lastly, when inveighing\nagainst the changeableness, fickleness, and infidelity of mankind, she quoted\nthe words of the poet--\n\nOut upon change! it tires the heart And weighs the noble spirit down; A vain,\nvain world indeed thou art That can such vile condition own The veil hath\nfallen from my eyes, I cannot love where I despise....\n\nYou can easily, O King Vikram, continue for yourself and conclude this\nlecture, which I leave unfinished on account of its length.\n\nChandraprabha and Sita, who called each other the Zodiacal Twins and Laughter\nLight,[151] and All-consenters, easily persuaded the old Raja that their\nhealth would be further improved by air, exercise, and distractions. Subichar,\nbeing delighted with the change that had taken place in a daughter whom he\nloved, and whom he had feared to lose, told them to do as they pleased. They\nbegan a new life, in which short trips and visits, baths and dances, music\nparties, drives in bullock chariots, and water excursions succeeded one\nanother.\n\nIt so happened that one day the Raja went with his whole family to a wedding\nfeast in the house of his grand treasurer, where the latter\'s son saw Manaswi\nin the beautiful shape of Sita. This was a third case of love at first sight,\nfor the young man immediately said to a particular friend, "If I obtain that\ngirl, I shall live; if not, I shall abandon life."\n\nIn the meantime the king. having enjoyed the feast, came back to his palace\nwith his whole family. The condition of the treasurer\'s son, however, became\nvery distressing; and through separation from his beloved, he gave up eating\nand drinking. The particular friend had kept the secret for some days, though\nburning to tell it. At length he found an excuse for himself in the sad state\nof his friend, and he immediately went and divulged all that he knew to the\ntreasurer. After this he felt relieved.\n\nThe minister repaired to the court, and laid his case before the king, saying,\n"Great Raja! through the love of that Brahman\'s daughter-in-law, my son\'s\nstate is very bad; he has given up eating and drinking; in fact he is consumed\nby the fire of separation. If now your majesty could show compassion, and\nbestow the girl upon him, his life would be saved. If not----"\n\n"Fool!" cried the Raja, who, hearing these words, had waxed very wroth; "it is\nnot right for kings to do injustice. Listen! when a person puts any one in\ncharge of a protector, how can the latter give away his trust without\nconsulting the person that trusted him? And yet this is what you wish me to\ndo."\n\nThe treasurer knew that the Raja could not govern his realm without him, and\nhe was well acquainted with his master\'s character. He said to himself, "This\nwill not last long;" but he remained dumb, simulating hopelessness, and\nhanging down his head, whilst Subichar alternately scolded and coaxed, abused\nand flattered him, in order to open his lips. Then, with tears in his eyes, he\nmuttered a request to take leave; and as he passed through the palace gates,\nhe said aloud, with a resolute air, "It will cost me but ten days of fasting!"\n\nThe treasurer, having returned home, collected all his attendants, and went\nstraightway to his son\'s room. Seeing the youth still stretched upon his\nsleeping-mat, and very yellow for the want of food. he took his hand, and said\nin a whisper, meant to be audible, "Alas! poor son, I can do nothing but\nperish with thee."\n\nThe servants, hearing this threat, slipped one by one out of the room, and\neach went to tell his friend that the grand treasurer had resolved to live no\nlonger. After which, they went back to the house to see if their master\nintended to keep his word, and curious to know, if he did intend to die, how,\nwhere, and when it was to be. And they were not disappointed: I do not mean\nthat the wished their lord to die, as he was a good master to them but still\nthere was an excitement in the thing----\n\n(Raja Vikram could not refrain from showing his anger at the insult thus cast\nby the Baital upon human nature; the wretch, however, pretending not to notice\nit, went on without interrupting himself)\n\n\\----which somehow or other pleased them.\n\nWhen the treasurer had spent three days without touching bread or water, all\nthe cabinet council met and determined to retire from business unless the Raja\nyielded to their solicitations. The treasurer was their working man. "Besides\nwhich," said the cabinet council, "if a certain person gets into the habit of\nrefusing us, what is to be the end of it, and what is the use of being cabinet\ncouncillors any longer?"\n\nEarly on the next morning, the ministers went in a body before the Raja, and\nhumbly represented that "the treasurer\'s son is at the point of death, the\neffect of a full heart and an empty stomach. Should he die, the father, who\nhas not eaten or drunk during the last three days" (the Raja trembled to hear\nthe intelligence, though he knew it), "his father, we say, cannot be saved. If\nthe father dies the affairs of the kingdom come to ruin,--is he not the grand\ntreasurer? It is already said that half the accounts have been gnawed by white\nants, and that some pernicious substance in the ink has eaten jagged holes\nthrough the paper, so that the other half of the accounts is illegible. It\nwere best, sire, that you agree to what we represent."\n\nThe white ants and corrosive ink were too strong for the Raja\'s determination.\nStill, wishing to save appearances, he replied, with much firmness, that he\nknew the value of the treasurer and his son, that he would do much to save\nthem, but that he had passed his royal word, and had undertaken a trust. That\nhe would rather die a dozen deaths than break his promise, or not discharge\nhis duty faithfully. That man\'s condition in this world is to depart from it,\nnone remaining in it; that one comes and that one goes, none knowing when or\nwhere; but that eternity is eternity for happiness or misery. And much of the\nsame nature, not very novel, and not perhaps quite to the purpose, but\nedifying to those who knew what lay behind the speaker\'s words.\n\nThe ministers did not know their lord\'s character so well as the grand\ntreasurer, and they were more impressed by his firm demeanour and the number\nof his words than he wished them to be. After allowing his speech to settle in\ntheir minds, he did away with a great part of its effect by declaring that\nsuch were the sentiments and the principles--when a man talks of his\nprinciples, O Vikram! ask thyself the reason why--instilled into his youthful\nmind by the most honourable of fathers and the most virtuous of mothers. At\nthe same time that he was by no means obstinate or proof against conviction.\nIn token whereof he graciously permitted the councillors to convince him that\nit was his royal duty to break his word and betray his trust, and to give away\nanother man\'s wife.\n\nPray do not lose your temper, O warrior king! Subichar, although a Raja, was a\nweak man; and you know, or you ought to know, that the wicked may be wise in\ntheir generation, but the weak never can.\n\nWell, the ministers hearing their lord\'s last words, took courage, and\nproceeded to work upon his mind by the figure of speech popularly called\n"rigmarole." They said: "Great king! that old Brahman has been gone many days,\nand has not returned; he is probably dead and burnt. It is therefore right\nthat by giving to the grand treasurer\'s son his daughter-in-law, who is only\naffianced, not fairly married, you should establish your government firmly.\nAnd even if he should return, bestow villages and wealth upon him; and if he\nbe not then content, provide another and a more beautiful wife for his son,\nand dismiss him. A person should be sacrificed for the sake of a family, a\nfamily for a city, a city for a country, and a country for a king!"\n\nSubichar having heard them, dismissed them with the remark that as so much was\nto be said on both sides, he must employ the night in thinking over the\nmatter, and that he would on the next day favour them with his decision. The\ncabinet councillors knew by this that he meant that he would go and consult\nhis wives. They retired contented, convinced that every voice would be in\nfavour of a wedding, and that the young girl, with so good an offer, would not\nsacrifice the present to the future.\n\nThat evening the treasurer and his son supped together.\n\nThe first words uttered by Raja Subichar, when he entered his daughter\'s\napartment, were an order addressed to Sita: "Go thou at once to the house of\nmy treasurer\'s son."\n\nNow, as Chandraprabha and Manaswi were generally scolding each other,\nChandraprabha and Sita were hardly on speaking terms. When they heard the\nRaja\'s order for their separation they were--\n\n\\--"Delighted?" cried Dharma Dhwaj, who for some reason took the greatest\ninterest in the narrative.\n\n"Overwhelmed with grief, thou most guileless Yuva Raja (young prince)!"\nejaculated the Vampire.\n\nRaja Vikram reproved his son for talking about thing of which he knew nothing,\nand the Baital resumed.\n\nThey turned pale and wept, and they wrung their hands, and they begged and\nargued and refused obedience. In fact they did everything to make the king\nrevoke his order.\n\n"The virtue of a woman," quoth Sita, "is destroyed through too much beauty;\nthe religion of a Brahman is impaired by serving kings; a cow is spoiled by\ndistant pasturage, wealth is lost by committing injustice, and prosperity\ndeparts from the house where promises are not kept."\n\nThe Raja highly applauded the sentiment, but was firm as a rock upon the\nsubject of Sita marrying the treasurer\'s son.\n\nChandraprabha observed that her royal father, usually so conscientious, must\nnow be acting from interested motives, and that when selfishness sways a man,\nright becomes left and left becomes right, as in the reflection of a mirror.\n\nSubichar approved of the comparison; he was not quite so resolved, but he\nshowed no symptoms of changing his mind.\n\nThen the Brahman\'s daughter-in-law, with the view of gaining time--a famous\nstratagem amongst feminines--said to the Raja: "Great king, if you are\ndetermined upon giving me to the grand treasurer\'s son, exact from him the\npromise that he will do what I bid him. Only on this condition will I ever\nenter his house!"\n\n"Speak, then," asked the king; "what will he have to do?"\n\nShe replied, "I am of the Brahman or priestly caste, he is the son of a\nKshatriya or warrior: the law directs that before we twain can wed, he should\nperform Yatra (pilgrimage) to all the holy places."\n\n"Thou hast spoken Veda-truth, girl," answered the Raja, not sorry to have\nfound so good a pretext for temporizing, and at the same time to preserve his\ncharacter for firmness, resolution, determination.\n\nThat night Manaswi and Chandraprabha, instead of scolding each other,\ncongratulated themselves upon having escaped an imminent danger--which they\ndid not escape.\n\nIn the morning Subichar sent for his ministers, including his grand treasurer\nand his love-sick son, and told them how well and wisely the Brahman\'s\ndaughter-in-law had spoken upon the subject of the marriage. All of them\napproved of the condition; but the young man ventured to suggest, that while\nhe was a-pilgrimaging the maiden should reside under his father\'s roof. As he\nand his father showed a disposition to continue their fasts in case of the\nsmall favour not being granted, the Raja, though very loath to separate his\nbeloved daughter and her dear friend, was driven to do it. And Sita was\ncarried off, weeping bitterly, to the treasurer\'s palace. That dignitary\nsolemnly committed her to the charge of his third and youngest wife, the lady\nSubhagya-Sundari, who was about her own age, and said, "You must both live\ntogether, without any kind of wrangling or contention, and do not go into\nother people\'s houses." And the grand treasurer\'s son went off to perform his\npilgrimages.\n\nIt is no less sad than true, Raja Vikram, that in less than six days the\ndisconsolate Sita waxed weary of being Sita, took the ball out of her mouth,\nand became Manaswi. Alas for the infidelity of mankind! But it is gratifying\nto reflect that he met with the punishment with which the Pandit Muldev had\nthreatened him. One night the magic pill slipped down his throat. When morning\ndawned, being unable to change himself into Sita, Manaswi was obliged to\nescape through a window from the lady Subhagya-Sundari\'s room. He sprained his\nankle with the leap, and he lay for a time upon the ground--where I leave him\nwhilst convenient to me.\n\nWhen Muldev quitted the presence of Subichar, he resumed his old shape, and\nreturning to his brother Pandit Shashi, told him what he had done. Whereupon\nShashi, the misanthrope, looked black, and used hard words and told his friend\nthat good nature and soft-heartedness had caused him to commit a very bad\naction--a grievous sin. Incensed at this charge, the philanthropic Muldev\nbecame angry, and said, "I have warned the youth about his purity; what harm\ncan come of it?"\n\n"Thou hast," retorted Shashi, with irritating coolness, "placed a sharp weapon\nin a fool\'s hand."\n\n"I have not," cried Muldev, indignantly.\n\n"Therefore," drawled the malevolent, "you are answerable for all the mischief\nhe does with it, and mischief assuredly he will do."\n\n"He will not, by Brahma!" exclaimed Muldev.\n\n"He will, by Vishnu!" said Shashi, with an amiability produced by having\ncompletely upset his friend\'s temper; "and if within the coming six months he\ndoes not disgrace himself, thou shalt have the whole of my book-case; but if\nhe does, the philanthropic Muldev will use all his skill and ingenuity in\nprocuring the daughter of Raja Subichar as a wife for his faithful friend\nShashi."\n\nHaving made this covenant, they both agreed not to speak of the matter till\nthe autumn.\n\nThe appointed time drawing near, the Pandits began to make inquiries about the\neffect of the magic pills. Presently they found out that Sita, alias Manaswi,\nhad one night mysteriously disappeared from the grand treasurer\'s house, and\nhad not been heard of since that time. This, together with certain other\nthings that transpired presently, convinced Muldev, who had cooled down in six\nmonths, that his friend had won the wager. He prepared to make honourable\npayment by handing a pill to old Shashi, who at once became a stout, handsome\nyoung Brahman, some twenty years old. Next putting a pill into his own mouth,\nhe resumed the shape and form under which he had first appeared before Raja\nSubichar; and, leaning upon his staff, he led the way to the palace.\n\nThe king, in great confusion, at once recognized the old priest, and guessed\nthe errand upon which he and the youth were come. However, he saluted them,\nand offered them seats, and receiving their blessings, he began to make\ninquiries about their health and welfare. At last he mustered courage to ask\nthe old Brahman where he had been living for so long a time.\n\n"Great king," replied the priest, "I went to seek after my son, and having\nfound him, I bring him to your majesty. Give him his wife, and I will take\nthem both home with me.\'\'\n\nRaja Subichar prevaricated not a little; but presently, being hard pushed, he\nrelated everything that had happened.\n\n"What is this that you have done?" cried Muldev, simulating excessive anger\nand astonishment. "Why have you given my son\'s wife in marriage to another\nman? You have done what you wished, and now, therefore, receive my Shrap\n(curse)!"\n\nThe poor Raja, in great trepidation, said, "O Vivinity! be not thus angry! I\nwill do whatever you bid me."\n\nSaid Muldev, "If through dread of my excommunication you will freely give\nwhatever I demand of you, then marry your daughter, Chandraprabha, to this my\nson. On this condition I forgive you. To me, now a necklace of pearls and a\nvenomous krishna (cobra capella); the most powerful enemy and the kindest\nfriend, the most precious gem and a clod of earth; the softest bed and the\nhardest stone; a blade of grass and the loveliest woman--are precisely the\nsame. All I desire is that in some holy place, repeating the name of God, I\nmay soon end my days."\n\nSubichar, terrified by this additional show of sanctity, at once summoned an\nastrologer, and fixed upon the auspicious moment and lunar influence. He did\nnot consult the princess, and had he done so she would not have resisted his\nwishes. Chandraprabha had heard of Sita\'s escape from the treasurer\'s house,\nand she had on the subject her own suspicions. Besides which she looked\nforward to a certain event, and she was by no means sure that her royal father\napproved of the Gandharba form of marriage--at least for his daughter. Thus\nthe Brahman\'s son receiving in due time the princess and her dowry, took leave\nof the king and returned to his own village.\n\nHardly, however, had Chandraprabha been married to Shashi the Pandit, when\nManaswi went to him, and began to wrangle, and said, "Give me my wife!" He had\nrecovered from the effects of his fall, and having lost her he therefore loved\nher--very dearly.\n\nBut Shashi proved by reference to the astrologers, priests, and ten persons as\nwitnesses, that he had duly wedded her, and brought her to his home;\n"therefore," said he, "she is my spouse."\n\nManaswi swore by all holy things that he had been legally married to her, and\nthat he was the father of her child that was about to be. "How then,"\ncontinued he, "can she be thy spouse?" He would have summoned Muldev as a\nwitness, but that worthy, after remonstrating with him, disappeared. He called\nupon Chandraprabha to confirm his statement, but she put on an innocent face,\nand indignantly denied ever having seen the man.\n\nStill, continued the Baital, many people believed Manaswi\'s story, as it was\nmarvellous and incredible. Even to the present day, there are many who\ndecidedly think him legally married to the daughter of Raja Subichar.\n\n"Then they are pestilent fellows!" cried the warrior king Vikram, who hated\nnothing more than clandestine and runaway matches. "No one knew that the\nvillain, Manaswi, was the father of her child; whereas, the Pandit Shashi\nmarried her lawfully, before witnesses, and with all the ceremonies.[152] She\ntherefore remains his wife, and the child will perform the funeral obsequies\nfor him, and offer water to the manes of his pitris (ancestors). At least, so\nsay law and justice."\n\n"Which justice is often unjust enough!" cried the Vampire; "and ply thy legs,\nmighty Raja; let me see if thou canst reach the sires-tree before I do."\n\n* * * * * *\n\n"The next story, O Raja Vikram, is remarkably interesting."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Vampire\'s Ninth Story.
