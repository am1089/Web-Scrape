[1894], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n5:5:2\n\n### SECOND BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n5:5:2:11\\. He performs the oblations of teams (prayu _g_ a _m_ havi _m_ shi).\nThe reason why he performs the oblations of teams, is that the anointed\nthereby yokes the seasons, and thus yoked those seasons draw him along, and he\nfollows the seasons thus yoked: therefore he performs the oblations of teams.\n\n5:5:2:22\\. There are twelve of these (oblations), for there are twelve months\nin the year: that is why there are twelve. 'Let him make offering month by\nmonth,' they say. Who knows about (the life of) man 2? Let him therefore not\nmake offering month by month. Moving eastward he offers six of them each at\nthe distance of the yoke-pin's throw from the other 3; and then turning\nbackward he offers six, each at a yoke-pin's throw from the other.\n\np. 124\n\n5:5:2:33\\. But let him not do it thus. He prepares those first six so as to\nhave a common barhis 1, after the manner of those deities (of the first six\noblations); even as in early spring they 2 would yoke their team and go onward\nuntil the rainy season, so does he now yoke the six seasons, and thus yoked\nthe six seasons draw him forward and he follows the six seasons thus yoked\nuntil the rainy season. Two of the (oxen) drawing the original (hall-door)\nfire are the sacrificial fee.\n\n5:5:2:44\\. He prepares the last six oblations so as to have a common barhis,\nafter the manner of those (six) deities. Even as they would return again\ntowards the rainy season, so does he yoke the six seasons, and thus yoked the\nsix seasons draw him towards the rainy season, and he follows the six seasons\nthus yoked, in the rainy season. Two of the (oxen) drawing the original fire\nare the sacrificial fee. And as to why the (oxen) drawing the original fire\nare the sacrificial fee,--the consecrated (king) now yokes the seasons, and it\nbeing oxen that (actually) draw (and thus represent the seasons), therefore\nthe (oxen) drawing the original fire are the sacrificial fee.\n\n5:5:2:55\\. Now as to this the Kurupa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas used formerly to say, 'It is\nthe seasons that, being yoked, draw us, and we follow the seasons thus yoked.'\nIt was because their kings were performers of the Ra _g_ asuya that they spake\nthus.\n\np. 125\n\n5:5:2:66\\. There is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni, a pap for Soma, a cake\non twelve or eight potsherds for Savit _ri_ , a pap for B _ri_ haspati, a cake\non ten potsherds for Tvash _t_ _ri_ , and one on twelve potsherds for (Agni)\nVai _s_ vanara--these are the first six oblations.\n\n5:5:2:77\\. The six last are paps,--a pap for Sarasvati, a pap for Pushan, a\npap for Mitra, a pap for Kshetrapati (the Landlord or Lord of the manor), a\npap for Varu _n_ a, and a pap for Aditi,--these are the last six paps.\n\n5:5:2:88\\. Thereupon they seize 1 a reddish-white (cow) which is clearly with\ncalf, (as a victim) for Aditi. The mode of procedure regarding her is the same\nas that of the eight-footed barren cow 2. Now, Aditi being this earth, it is\nher embryo (child) he thereby causes him (the king) to be. The sacrificial fee\nfor this (cow-offering) is just such a reddish-white cow that is clearly with\ncalf.\n\n5:5:2:99\\. They then seize a dappled one, which is clearly with calf, (as a\nvictim) for the Maruts. The mode of procedure regarding this one is the same.\nThe Maruts being the clans, he thereby makes him the embryo 3 of the clans.\nThe sacrificial fee for this (cow-offering) is just such a dappled (cow) that\nis clearly with calf.\n\np. 126\n\n5:5:2:1010\\. These two animal victims, whilst being such, are seized (by some)\nin a different way. The one that is seized for Aditi, (some) seize for the\n\xc3\x82dityas,--the \xc3\x82dityas being the All, he (the priest) thereby makes him the\nembryo of the All (universe). And the one that is seized for the Maruts,\n(some) seize for the All-gods,--the All-gods being the All, he thereby makes\nhim the embryo of the All.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[123:2](sbe4124.htm#fr_242) 'But who (knows if he) will live a year?'

See [paragraph\n5](sbe4124.htm#5:5:2:5).\n\n[125:1](sbe4124.htm#fr_246) In the Taittiriya ceremonial this animal sacrifice\nprecedes the 'prayu _g_ a _m_ havi _m_ shi;' being itself succeeded in the\nfirst place by the 'satyadutana _m_ havi _m_ shi.'\n\n[125:2](sbe4124.htm#fr_247) On the course of procedure regarding the 'ash _t_\napadi,' or (supposed) barren cow, found ultimately to be impregnated, see part\nii, p. 391 seq.\n\n[125:3](sbe4124.htm#fr_248) That is, he causes him to spring forth from the\nmidst of the people, and be protected by them on all sides.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 5, 3.
