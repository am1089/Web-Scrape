Now, therefore, we will declare the rule for (performing) the twilight\ndevotions.\n\np. 246\n\n2\\. Going to a (sacred) bathing-place, he shall bathe, in case he is impure;\nin case he is pure, he may, optionally, omit the bath. (But in either case) he\nshall wash his feet and hands. Sipping water and sprinkling himself, while he\nrecites the (Rik-verses) containing the word Surabhi, the Abli\xe1\xb9\x85gas, those\naddressed to Varu _n_ a, the Hira _n_ yavar _n_ as, the Pavamanis, the (sacred\nsyllables called) Vyah _ri_ tis, and other purificatory (texts), he becomes\npure (and fit to perform the twilight devotions). 2\n\n3\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Submersion in water (and)\nbathing are prescribed for all the (four) castes. But sprinkling (water over\nthe body), while Mantras (are being recited), is the particular (duty) of the\ntwice-born.'\n\n4\\. He who sprinkles himself (with water) at the beginning of any sacred rite,\n--before the time of the twilight devotions,--while reciting that same\ncollection of purificatory (texts), becomes pure.\n\n5\\. Now they quote also (the following rules): Seated, with his face to the\nwest, on Darbha grass and holding Darbha blades in his (right) hand, which 5\n\np. 247\n\nis filled with water, he shall repeat the Savitri one thousand times;\n\n6\\. Or (he may recite the verse) one hundred times, suppressing his breath; 6\n\n7\\. Or mentally ten times, adding the syllable Om at the beginning and at the\nend and the seven Vyah _ri_ tis. 7\n\n8\\. And if he is tired by three suppressions of his breath (performed) with\n(the recitation of) the (Anuvaka called) Brahmah _ri_ daya (the heart of\nBrahman, then let him repeat the Savitri). 8\n\n9\\. In the evening he worships (the sun) with the two (verses) addressed to\nVaru _n_ a, 'Hear this my call, O Varu _n_ a,' and 'Therefore I go to thee.' 9\n\n10\\. The same (rules apply to the twilight devotion) in the morning, (but the\nworshipper) shall face the east and stand upright. 10\n\n11\\. In the day-time he worships (the sun) with the two (verses) addressed to\nMitra, 'The glory of Mitra, who supports men,' and 'Mitra causes men to join.'\n11\n\n12\\. Let him begin (the twilight devotion) in the 12\n\np. 248\n\nmorning very early, and finish it when the sun has risen.\n\n13\\. Let him begin (the twilight devotion) in the evening, when (the sun) has\nset, (and finish it) very soon after (the appearance of the stars);\n\n14\\. And the complete observance of the twilight devotions (produces as its\nreward) an uninterrupted succession of days and nights. 14\n\n15\\. Now they quote with reference to this (subject) also the following two\nverses, which have been proclaimed by the Lord of created beings (Pra _g_\napati) 'How can those twice-born men be called Brahma _n_ as who do not\nperform their twilight devotions, in the morning and in the evening at the\nproper time? At his pleasure a righteous king may appoint those Brahma _n_ as\nwho neglect to daily perform the twilight devotions, both at morn and at eve,\nto do the work of _S_ udras.'\n\n16\\. If the time for the (twilight devotion) is allowed to pass in the\nevening, (the offender shall) fast during the night; and if it is neglected in\nthe morning, he shall fast during the (next) day. 16\n\n17\\. He obtains (thereby) the (same) reward as if he had remained standing and\nsitting (in the twilight).\n\n18\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Whatever sin (a man) may\nhave committed with his organ, with his feet, with his arms, by thoughts or by\nspeech, from (all) that he is freed by performing the twilight devotion in the\nevening.' 18\n\n19\\. (The worshipper) becomes also connected\n\np. 249\n\n(thereby) with the (next) night, and Varu _n_ a will not seize him.\n\n20\\. In like manner he becomes free from the sin committed during the night by\nworshipping in the morning. 20\n\n21\\. He is also connected with the (next) day, Mitra protects him and \xc3\x82ditya\nleads him up to heaven.\n\n22\\. It is declared in the Veda, 'A Brahma _n_ a who in this same manner daily\nworships in the twilight, both at morn and at eve and, being sanctified by the\nBrahman, becoming one with the Brahman, and resplendent through the Brahman,\nfollows the rules of the _S_ astra, gains the heaven of Brahman.' 22\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[246:2](sbe1461.htm#fr_1212) **7**. 'A sacred bathing-place, i.e. a river or\npond outside the village.'--Govinda. The same author adds that the hands must\nbe washed as far as the wrist, that while sipping water the worshipper is to\nrepeat in the evening, Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 31, and in the morning X,\n32, and that if he bathes, Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 1, 12, and other texts\nmust be recited. The Rik containing the word Surabhi is found Taittiriya Sa\n_m_ hita I, 5, 11, 4, 7; the three Abli\xe1\xb9\x85gas, Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 1, 11;\nthe four verses addressed to Varu _n_ a, Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita III, 4, 11, 4,\nand Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka II, 4, 4. By the term Pavamanis the\nPavamananuvaka, Taittiriya Brahma _n_ a I, 4, 8, is meant.\n\n[246:5](sbe1461.htm#fr_1213) The injunction to turn the face to the west\nrefers to the evening prayer; see also below, Sutra 10.\n\n[247:6](sbe1461.htm#fr_1214) Govinda states that pra _n_ ayama _s_ a _h_ ,\n'suppressing his breath,' has in this Sutra no technical meaning.\n\n[247:7](sbe1461.htm#fr_1215) Govinda says that the order to be observed in\nthis case is as follows: First the syllable Om is to be recited, next the\nseven Vyah _ri_ tis, beginning with Bhu _h_ and ending with Satyam, then the\nSavitri, and finally again the syllable Om.\n\n[247:8](sbe1461.htm#fr_1216) The Brahmah _ri_ daya is Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka\nX, 28. This Anuvaka may be repeated three times for each Pra _n_ ayama (see\nVasish _th_ a XXV, 13), or altogether nine times, and, if the worshipper is\nthen tired, he may go on repeating the Savitri without suppressing his breath.\n\n[247:9](sbe1461.htm#fr_1217) Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita II, 1, 11, 6.\n\n[247:10](sbe1461.htm#fr_1218) Gautama II. 11.\n\n[247:11](sbe1461.htm#fr_1219) Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita III, 4, II, 5.\n\n[247:12](sbe1461.htm#fr_1220) Very early, i.e. when the stars are still\nvisible; see also Gautama II, 11, and note.\n\n[248:14](sbe1461.htm#fr_1221) The day and night will not be cut off from his\nexistence.\n\n[248:16](sbe1461.htm#fr_1222) Vasish _th_ a XX, 4-5.\n\n[248:18](sbe1461.htm#fr_1223) Vasish _th_ a XXVI, 2.\n\n[249:20](sbe1461.htm#fr_1224) Vasish _th_ a XXVI, 3.\n\n[249:22](sbe1461.htm#fr_1225) Brahman means here the Veda, the Savitri, and\nthe universal soul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Adhyaya 5, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 8](sbe1462.htm)\n\n"
