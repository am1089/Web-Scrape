XIII.\n\nPosterity of Dhruva. Legend of Ven\xcc\x81a: his impiety: he is put to death by the\nRishis. Anarchy ensues. The production of Nishada and Prithu: the latter the\nfirst king. The origin of Suta and Magadha: they enumerate the duties of\nkings. Prithu compels Earth to acknowledge his authority: he levels it:\nintroduces cultivation: erects cities. Earth called after him Prithivi:\ntypified as a cow.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--The sons of Dhruva, by his wife \xc5\x9aambhu, were Bhavya and Slisht\xcc\x81i.\n[Suchchaya](errata.htm#5), the wife of the latter, was the mother of five\nvirtuous sons, Ripu, Ripunjaya, Vipra, Vrikala, and Vrikatejas. The son of\nRipu, by Vrihati, was the illustrious Chakshusha, who begot the Manu\nChakshusha on Pushkarin\xcc\x81i, of the family of Varun\xcc\x81a, the daughter of the\nvenerable patriarch Anaran\xcc\x81ya. The Manu had, by his wife Navala, the daughter\nof the patriarch Vairaja, ten noble sons, Uru, Pura, Satadyumna, Tapaswi,\nSatyavak, Kavi, Agnisht\xcc\x81oma, Atiratra, Sudyumna, and Abhimanyu. The wife of\nUru, \xc3\x81gneyi, bore six excellent sons, Anga, Sumanas, Swati, Kratu, Angiras,\nand \xc5\x9aiva. Anga had, by his wife Sunitha, only one son, named Ven\xcc\x81a, whose\nright arm was rubbed by the Rishis, for the purpose of producing from it\nprogeny. From the arm of Ven\xcc\x81a, thus rubbed, sprang a celebrated monarch,\nnamed Prithu, by whom, in olden time, the earth was milked for the advantage\nof mankind 1.\n\np. 99\n\nMAITREYA.--Best of Munis, tell me why was the right hand of Ven\xcc\x81a rubbed by\nthe holy sages, in consequence of which the heroic Prithu was produced.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Sunitha was originally the daughter of Mrityu, by whom she was\ngiven to Anga to wife. She bore him Ven\xcc\x81a, who inherited the evil propensities\nof his maternal grandfather. When he was inaugurated by the Rishis monarch of\nthe earth, he caused. it to be every where proclaimed, that no worship should\nbe performed, no oblations offered, no gifts bestowed upon the Brahmans. "I,\nthe king," said he, "am the lord of sacrifice; for who but I am entitled to\nthe oblations." The Rishis, respectfully approaching the sovereign, addressed\nhim in melodious accents, and said, "Gracious prince, we salute you; hear what\nwe have to represent. For the preservation of your kingdom and your life, and\nfor the benefit of all your subjects, permit us to worship Hari, the lord of\nall sacrifice, the god of gods, with solemn and protracted rites 2; a portion\nof the fruit of which will revert to you 3. Vishn\xcc\x81u, the god of oblations,\nbeing propitiated with sacrifice by us, will grant you, oh king, all your\ndesires. Those princes have all their wishes gratified, in whose realms Hari,\nthe lord of sacrifice, is adored with sacrificial rites." "Who," exclaimed\nVen\xcc\x81a, "is superior to me? who besides me is entitled to worship? who is this\nHari, whom you style the lord of sacrifice? Brahma, Janarddana. \xc5\x9aambhu, Indra,\nVayu, Ravi (the sun), Hutabhuk\n\np. 100\n\n[paragraph continues] (fire), Varun\xcc\x81a, Dhata, Pusha, (the sun), Bhumi (earth),\nthe lord of night (the moon); all these, and whatever other gods there be who\nlisten to our vows; all these are present in the person of a king: the essence\nof a sovereign is all that is divine. Conscious of this, I have issued my\ncommands, and look that you obey them. You are not to sacrifice, not to offer\noblations, not to give alms. As the first duty of women is obedience to their\nlords, so observance of my orders is incumbent, holy men, on you." "Give\ncommand, great king," replied the Rishis, "that piety may suffer no decrease.\nAll this world is but a transmutation of oblations; and if devotion be\nsuppressed, the world is at an end." But Ven\xcc\x81a was entreated in vain; and\nalthough this request was repeated by the sages, he refused to give the order\nthey suggested. Then those pious Munis were filled with wrath, and cried out\nto each other, "Let this wicked wretch be slain. The impious man who has\nreviled the god of sacrifice who is without beginning or end, is not fit to\nreign over the earth." And they fell upon the king, and beat him with blades\nof holy grass, consecrated by prayer, and slew him, who had first been\ndestroyed by his impiety towards god.\n\nAfterwards the Munis beheld a great dust arise, and they said to the people\nwho were nigh, "What is this?" and the people answered and said, "Now that the\nkingdom is without a king, the dishonest men have begun to seize the property\nof their neighbours. The great dust that you behold, excellent Munis, is\nraised by troops of clustering robbers, hastening to fall upon their prey."\nThe sages, hearing this, consulted, and together rubbed the thigh of the king,\nwho had left no offspring, to produce a son. From the thigh, thus rubbed, came\nforth a being of the complexion of a charred stake, with flattened features\n(like a negro), and of dwarfish stature. "What am I to do?" cried he eagerly\nto the Munis. "Sit down" (Nishida), said they; and thence his name was\nNishada. His descendants, the inhabitants of the Vindhya mountain, great Muni,\nare still called Nishadas, and are characterized by the exterior tokens of\ndepravity 4. By this means the wickedness of Versa was expelled; those\n\np. 101\n\n[paragraph continues] Nishadas being born of his sins, and carrying them away.\nThe Brahmans then proceeded to rub the right arm of the king, from which\nfriction was engendered the illustrious son of Ven\xcc\x81a, named Prithu,\nresplendent in person, as if the blazing deity of Fire bad been manifested.\n\nThere then fell from the sky the primitive bow (of Mahadeva) named Ajagava,\nand celestial arrows, and panoply from heaven. At the birth of Prithu all\nliving creatures rejoiced; and Ven\xcc\x81a, delivered by his being born from the\nhell named Put, ascended to the realms above. The seas and rivers, bringing\njewels from their depths, and water to perform the ablutions of his\ninstallation, appeared. The great parent of all, Brahma, with the gods and the\ndescendants of Angiras (the fires), and with all things animate or inanimate,\nassembled and performed the ceremony of consecrating the son of Ven\xcc\x81a.\nBeholding in his right hand the (mark of the) discus of Vishn\xcc\x81u, Brahma\nrecognised a portion of that divinity in Prithu, and was much pleased; for the\nmark of Vishn\xcc\x81u\'s discus is visible in the hand of one who is born to be a\nuniversal emperor 5, one whose power is invincible even by the gods.\n\nThe mighty Prithu, the son of Veda, being thus invested with universal\ndominion by those who were skilled in the rite, soon removed the grievances of\nthe people whom his father had oppressed, and from winning\n\np. 102\n\ntheir affections he derived the title of Raja, or king 6. The waters became\nsolid, when he traversed the ocean: the mountains opened him a path: his\nbanner passed unbroken (through the forests): the earth needed not\ncultivation; and at a thought food was prepared: all kine were like the cow of\nplenty: honey was stored in every flower. At the sacrifice of the birth of\nPrithu, which was performed by Brahma, the intelligent Suta (herald or bard)\nwas produced, in the juice of the moon-plant, on the very birth-day 7: at that\ngreat sacrifice also was produced the accomplished Magadha: and the holy sages\nsaid to these two persons, "Praise ye the king Prithu, the illustrious son of\nVen\xcc\x81a; for this is your especial function, and here is a fit subject for your\npraise." But they respectfully replied to the Brahmans, "We know not the acts\nof the new-born king of the earth; his merits are not understood by us; his\nfame is not spread abroad: inform us upon what subject we may dilate in his\npraise." "Praise the king," said the Rishis, "for the acts this heroic monarch\nwill perform; praise him for the virtues he will display."\n\nThe king, hearing these words, was much pleased, and reflected that persons\nacquire commendation by virtuous actions, and that consequently his virtuous\nconduct would be the theme of the eulogium which the bards were about to\npronounce: whatever merits, then, they should panegyrize in their encomium, he\ndetermined that he would endeavour to acquire; and if they should point out\nwhat faults ought to be avoided, he would try to shun them. He therefore\nlistened attentively, as the sweet-voiced encomiasts celebrated the future\nvirtues of Prithu, the enlightened son of Ven\xcc\x81a.\n\n"The king is a speaker of truth, bounteous, an observer of his promises; he is\nwise, benevolent, patient, valiant, and a terror to the wicked; he knows his\nduties; he acknowledges services; he is compassionate and\n\np. 103\n\nkind-spoken; he respects the venerable; he performs sacrifices; he reverences\nthe Brahmans; he cherishes the good; and in administering justice is\nindifferent to friend or foe."\n\nThe virtues thus celebrated by the Suta and the Magadha were cherished in the\nremembrance of the Raja, and practised by him when occasion arose. Protecting\nthis earth, the monarch performed many great sacrificial ceremonies,\naccompanied by liberal donations. His subjects soon approached him, suffering\nfrom the famine by which they were afflicted, as all the edible plants had\nperished during the season of anarchy. In reply to his question of the cause\nof their coming, they told him, that in the interval in which the earth was\nwithout a king all vegetable products had been withheld, and that consequently\nthe people had perished. "Thou," said they, "art the bestower of subsistence\nto us; thou art appointed, by the creator, the protector of the people: grant\nus vegetables, the support of the lives of thy subjects, who are perishing\nwith hunger."\n\nOn hearing this, Prithu took up his divine bow Ajagava, and his celestial\narrows, and in great wrath marched forth to assail the Earth. Earth, assuming\nthe figure of a cow, fled hastily from him, and traversed, through fear of the\nking, the regions of Brahma and the heavenly spheres; but wherever went the\nsupporter of living things, there she beheld Vain\xcc\x81ya with uplifted weapons: at\nlast, trembling with terror, and anxious to escape his arrows, the Earth\naddressed Prithu, the hero of resistless prowess. "Know you not, king of men,"\nsaid the Earth, "the sin of killing a female, that you thus perseveringly seek\nto slay me." The prince replied; "When the happiness of many is secured by.\nthe destruction of one malignant being, the death of that being is an act of\nvirtue." "But," said the Earth, "if, in order to promote the welfare of your\nsubjects, you put an end to me, whence, best of monarchs, will thy people\nderive their support." "Disobedient to my rule," rejoined Prithu, "if I\ndestroy thee, I will support my people by the efficacy of my own devotions."\nThen the Earth, overcome with apprehension, and trembling in every limb,\nrespectfully saluted the king, and thus spake: "All undertakings are\nsuccessful, if suitable means of effecting them are employed.\n\np. 104\n\n[paragraph continues] I will impart to you means of success, which you can\nmake use of if you please. All vegetable products are old, and destroyed by\nme; but at your command I will restore them, as developed from my milk. Do you\ntherefore, for the benefit of mankind, most virtuous of princes, give me that\ncalf, by which I may be able to secrete milk. Make also all places level, so\nthat I may cause my milk, the seed of all vegetation, to flow every where\naround."\n\nPrithu accordingly uprooted the mountains, by hundreds and thousands, for\nmyriads of leagues, and they were thenceforth piled upon one another. Before\nhis time there were no defined boundaries of villages or towns, upon the\nirregular surface of the earth; there was no cultivation, no pasture, no\nagriculture, no highway for merchants: all these things (or all civilization)\noriginated in the reign of Prithu. Where the ground was made level, the king\ninduced his subjects to take up their abode. Before his time, also, the fruits\nand roots which constituted the food of the people were procured with great\ndifficulty, all vegetables having been destroyed; and he therefore, having\nmade Swayambhuva Manu the calf 8, milked the Earth, and received the milk into\nhis own hand, for the benefit of mankind. Thence proceeded all kinds of corn\nand vegetables upon which people subsist now and perpetually. By granting life\nto the Earth, Prithu was as her father, and she thence derived the patronymic\nappellation Prithivi (the daughter of Prithu). Then the gods, the sages, the\ndemons, the Rakshasas, the Gandharbhas, Yakshas, Pitris, serpents, mountains,\nand trees, took a milking vessel suited to their kind, and milked the earth of\nappropriate milk, and the milker and the calf were both peculiar to their own\nspecies 9.\n\np. 105\n\nThis Earth, the mother, the nurse, the receptacle, and nourisher of all\nexistent things, was produced from the sole of the foot of Vishn\xcc\x81u. And thus\nwas born the mighty Prithu, the heroic son of Ven\xcc\x81a, who was the lord of the\nearth, and who, from conciliating the affections of the people, was the first\nruler to whom the title of Raja was ascribed. Whoever shall recite this story\nof the birth of Prithu, the son of Ven\xcc\x81a, shall never suffer any retribution\nfor the evil he may have committed: and such is the virtue of the tale of\nPrithu\'s birth, that those who hear it repeated shall be relieved from\naffliction 10.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[98:1](vp048.htm#fr_265) The descent of Puru from Dhruva is similarly traced\nin the Matsya Puran\xcc\x81a, but with some variety of nomenclature: thus the wife of\nDhruva is named Dhanya; and the eldest son of the Manu, Taru. The Vayu\nintroduces another generation, making the eldest son of Slisht\xcc\x81i, or as there\ntermed Pusht\xcc\x81i, father of Udaradhi; and the latter the father of Ripu, the\nfather of Chakshusha, the father of the Manu. The Bhagavata has an almost\nentirely different set of names, having converted the family of Dhruva into\npersonifications of divisions of time and of day and night. The account there\ngiven is, Dhruva had, by his wife Bhrami (revolving), the daughter of \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bumara\n(the sphere), Kalpa and Vatsara. The latter married Suvithi, and had six sons,\nPushparn\xcc\x81a, Tigmaketu, Isha, Urjja, Vasu, Jaya. The first married Prabha and\nDosha, and had by the former, Pratah (dawn), Madhyadina (noon), and Saya\n(evening); and by the latter, Pradosha, Ni\xc5\x9bitha, and Vyusht\xcc\x81a, or the\nbeginning, middle, and end of night. The last has, by Pushkarin\xcc\x81i, Chakshush,\nmarried p. 99 to \xc3\x81kuti, and the father of Chakshusha Manu. He has twelve sons,\nPuru, Kritsna, Rita, Dyumna, Satyavat, Dhrita, Vrata, Agnisht\xcc\x81oma, Atiratra,\nPradyumna, Sivi, and Ulmuka. The last is the father of six sons, named as in\nour text, except the last, who is called Gaya. The eldest, Anga, is the father\nof Ven\xcc\x81a, the father of Prithu. These additions are evidently the creatures of\nthe author\'s imagination. The Brahma Puran\xcc\x81a and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba have the same\ngenealogy as the Vishn\xcc\x81u, reading, as do the Matsya and Vayu, Pushkarini or\nViran\xcc\x81i, the daughter of Viran\xcc\x81a, instead of Varun\xcc\x81a. They, as well as copies\nof the text, present several other varieties of nomenclature. The Padma P.\n(Bhumi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a) says Anga was of the family of Atri, in allusion perhaps to\nthe circumstance mentioned in the Brahma P. of Uttanapada\'s adoption by that\nRishi.\n\n[99:2](vp048.htm#fr_266) With the Dirghasatra, \'long sacrifice;\' a ceremony\nlasting a thousand years.\n\n[99:3](vp048.htm#fr_267) That is, the land will be fertile in proportion as\nthe gods are propitiated, and the king will benefit accordingly, as a sixth\npart of the merit and of the produce will be his. So the commentator explains\nthe word \'portion.\'\n\n[100:4](vp048.htm#fr_268) The Matsya says there were born outcast or barbarous\nraces, Mlechchas, as black as collyrium. The Bhagavata describes an individual\nof dwarfish p. 101 stature, with short arms and legs, of a complexion as black\nas a crow, with projecting chin, broad flat nose, red eyes, and tawny hair;\nwhose descendants were mountaineers and foresters: The Padma (Bhu. Kh.) has a\nsimilar description, adding to the dwarfish stature and black complexion, a\nwide mouth, large ears, and a protuberant belly. It also particularizes his\nposterity as Nishadas, Kiratas, Bhillas, Bahanakas, Bhramaras, Pulindas, and\nother barbarians, or Mlechchas, living in woods and on mountains. These\npassages intend, and do not much exaggerate, the uncouth appearance of the\nGoands, Koles, Bhils, and other uncivilized tribes, scattered along the\nforests and mountains of central India, from Behar to Kandesh, and who are not\nimprobably the predecessors of the present occupants of the cultivated\nportions of the country. They are always very black, ill-shapen, and dwarfish,\nand have countenances of a very African character.\n\n[101:5](vp048.htm#fr_269) A Chakra-vertti, or, according to the text, one in\nwhom the Chakra, the discus of Vishn\xcc\x81u, abides (varttate); such a figure being\ndelineated by the lines of the hand. The grammatical etymology is, \'he who\nabides in, or rules over, an extensive territory called a Chakra.\'\n\n[102:6](vp048.htm#fr_270) From raga, \'passion\' or \'affection;\' but the more\nobvious etymology is raj, to shine\' or \'be splendid.\'\n\n[102:7](vp048.htm#fr_271) The birth of Prithu is to be considered as the\nsacrifice, of which Brahma, the creator, was the performer; but in other\nplaces, as in the Padma, it is considered that an actual sacrificial rite was\ncelebrated, at which the first encomiasts were produced. The Bhagavata does\nnot account for their appearance.\n\n[104:8](vp048.htm#fr_272) \'Having willed or determined the Manu Swayambhuva to\nbe the calf:\' ###. So the Padma P.: ###. The Bhagavata has, \'Having made the\nManu the calf.\' By the calf,\' or Manu in that character, is typified, the\ncommentator observes, the promoter of the multiplication of progeny: ###.\n\n[104:9](vp048.htm#fr_273) The Matsya, Brahma, Bhagavata, and Padma enter into\na greater detail of this milking, specifying typically the calf, the milker,\nthe milk, and the vessel. Thus, according to the Matsya, the Rishis milked the\nearth through Vrihaspati; their calf p. 105 was Soma; the Vedas were the\nvessel; and the milk was devotion. When the gods milked the earth, the milker\nwas Mitra (the sun); Indra was the calf; superhuman power was the produce. The\ngods had a gold, the Pitris a silver vessel: and for the latter, the milker\nwas Antaka (death); Yama was the calf; the milk was Swadha, or oblation. The\nNaga, or snake-gods, had a gourd for their pail; their calf was Takshaka;\nDhritarasht\xcc\x81ra (the serpent) was their milker; and their milk was poison. For\nthe Asuras, Maya was the milk; Virochana, the son of Prahlada, was the calf;\nthe milker was Dwimurddha; and the vessel was of iron. The Yakshas made\nVaisravan\xcc\x81a their calf; their vessel was of unbaked earth; the milk was the\npower of disappearing. The Rakshasas and others employed Raupyanabha as the\nmilker; their calf was Sumali; and their milk was blood. Chitraratha was the\ncalf, Vasuruchi the milker, of the Gandharbas and nymphs, who milked fragrant\nodours into a cup of lotus leaves. On behalf of the mountains, Meru was the\nmilker; Himavat the calf; the pail was of crystal; and the milk was of herbs\nand gems. The trees extracted sap in a vessel of the Pala\xc5\x9ba, the Sal being the\nmilker, and the Plaksha the calf. The descriptions that occur in the\nBhagavata, Padma, and Brahma Puran\xcc\x81as are occasionally slightly varied, but\nthey are for the most part in the same words as that of the Matsya. These\nmystifications are all probably subsequent modifications of the original\nsimple allegory, which typified the earth as a cow, who yielded to every class\nof beings the milk they desired, or the object of their wishes.\n\n[105:10](vp048.htm#fr_274) Another reading is, \'It counteracts evil dreams.\'\nThe legend of Prithu is briefly given in the Mahabharata, Raja Dherma, and\noccurs in most of the Puran\xcc\x81as, but in greatest detail in our text, in the\nBhagavata, and especially in the Padma, Bhumi Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, s. 29, 30. All the\nversions, however, are essentially the same.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIV](vp049.htm)\n\n'
