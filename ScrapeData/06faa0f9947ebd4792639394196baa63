But, indeed, that glory, royal power, passes away from him who\nperforms the A _s_ vamedha.\n\n13:2:9:22\\. [The Udgat _ri_  1 says concerning the king\'s favourite wife, Va\n_g_. S. XXIII, 26,] \'Raise her upwards 2,\'--the A _s_ vamedha, doubtless, is\nthat glory, royal power: that glory, royal power, he thus raises for him (the\nSacrificer) upward.\n\n13:2:9:33\\. \'Even as one taking a burden up a mountain,\'--glory (pomp),\ndoubtless, is the burden of royal power: that glory, royal power, he thus\nfastens on him (as a burden); but he also endows him with that glory, royal\npower.\n\n13:2:9:44\\. \'And may the centre of her body prosper,\'--the centre of royal\npower, doubtless, is glory: glory (prosperity), food, he thus lays into the\nvery centre of royal power (or, the kingdom).\n\n13:2:9:55\\. \'As one winnowing in the cool breeze,\'--the cool of royal power,\ndoubtless, is security of\n\np. 325\n\npossession: security of possession he procures for him.\n\n13:2:9:66\\. [The Adhvaryu addresses one of the attendant maids, Va _g_. S.\nXXIII, 22,] \'That little bird,\'--the little bird, doubtless, is the people (or\nclan),--\'which bustles with (the sound) "ahalak,"\'--for the people, indeed,\nbustle for (the behoof of) royal power,--\'thrusts the "pasas" into the cleft,\nand the "dharaka" devours it,\'--the cleft, doubtless, is the people, and the\n\'pasas\' is royal power; and royal power, indeed, presses hard on the people;\nwhence the wielder of royal power is apt to strike down people.\n\n13:2:9:77\\. [The Brahman addresses the queen consort, Va _g_. S. XXIII, 24,]\n\'Thy mother and father,\'--the mother, doubtless, is this (earth), and the\nfather yonder (sky): by means of these two he causes him to go to\nheaven;--\'mount to the top of the tree,\'--the top of royal power, doubtless,\nis glory: the top of royal power, glory, he thus causes him to\nattain;--\'saying, "I pass along," thy father passed his fist to and fro in the\ncleft,\'--the cleft, doubtless, is the people; and the fist is royal power; and\nroyal power, indeed, presses hard on the people; whence he who wields royal\npower is apt to strike down people 1.\n\n13:2:9:88\\. [The chamberlain addresses the king\'s fourth wife, Va _g_. S.\nXXIII, 30,] \'When the deer eats the corn,\'--the grain (growing in the field),\ndoubtless, is the people, and the deer is royal power: he\n\np. 326\n\nthus makes the people to be food for the royal power, whence the wielder of\nroyal power feeds on the people;--\'it thinks not of the fat cattle,\'--whence\nthe king does not rear cattle;--\'when the _S_ udra woman is the Arya\'s\nmistress, he seeks not riches that he may thrive 1,\'--hence he does not anoint\nthe son of a Vai _s_ ya woman.\n\n13:2:9:99\\. But, indeed, the vital airs pass from those who speak impure\nspeech at the sacrifice. [The queen consort having been made to rise by her\nattendants, the priests and chamberlain say, Va _g_. S. XXIII, 32, _Ri_ g-v.\nS. IV, 39, 6,] \'The praises of Dadhikravan have I sung, (the victorious,\npowerful horse: may he make fragrant our mouths, and prolong our lives!),\'--\nthus they finally utter a verse containing the word \'fragrant\': it is (their\nown) speech they purify 2, and the vital airs do not pass from them.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[324:1](sbe44091.htm#fr_831) The colloquy between the men and women, referred\nto in [paragraphs 1](sbe44091.htm#13:2:9:1)-[8](sbe44091.htm#13:2:9:8), would\nseem to go on simultaneously. The verse addressed by the Hot _ri_ to the\nking\'s discarded wife, Va _g_. S. XXIII, 28, is omitted by the Brahma _n_ a,\nas are also the verses spoken in reply by the women (with their attendants),\nand closely resembling those of the men in tone and wording. According to some\nauthorities it is the attendant women alone who reply, not the king\'s wives.\nKaty. XX, 6, 20.\n\n[324:2](sbe44091.htm#fr_832) Mahidhara takes the objective pronoun to refer to\nthe Vavata, whilst Harisvamin, on the other hand, supplies some such word as \'\n_s_ a _t_ ika _m_.\'\n\n[325:1](sbe44091.htm#fr_833) The Mahishi: Thy mother and father are playing on\nthe top of the tree like thy mouth when thou wilt talk: do not talk so much,\nBrahman!\n\n[326:1](sbe44091.htm#fr_834) Mahidhara interprets,--then he (her husband), the\n_S_ udra, does not wish for wealth, but is unhappy.\n\n[326:2](sbe44091.htm#fr_835) That is to say, they make amends for any breaches\nof decorum committed in the preceding colloquy.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 2, 10.
