The works of the a _s_ ramas (are incumbent on him) also (who does not\ndesire release); because they are enjoined.\n\nUnder Sutra 26 it has been proved that the work's enjoined on the a _s_ ramas\nare means of knowledge. Now we will consider whether those works have to be\nperformed also by him who does not desire final release and therefore takes\nhis stand on his a _s_ rama merely without wishing for knowledge--Here the\npurvapakshin maintains that as the works incumbent on the a _s_ ramas are\nenjoined as means of knowledge by the passage, 'Him the Brahma _n_ as seek to\nknow by the study of the Veda' &c., the works of permanent obligation are not\nto be performed by him who, not desirous of knowledge, wishes for some other\nfruit. Or else they are to be performed by him also; but then they cannot be\nmeans of knowledge, since it would be contradictory to attribute to them a\npermanent and a non-permanent connexion. 1\n\nAgainst this conclusion the Sutrakara remarks that the works of permanent\nobligation are to be performed by\n\np. 313\n\nhim only who, not desirous of release, takes his stand on the a _s_ ramas\nmerely, because they are enjoined by texts such 'as long as his life lasts he\nis to offer the agnihotra.' For to such texts no excessive weight must be\nascribed.--The next Sutra replies to the objection raised above in the words,\n'but then they cannot be means of knowledge.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[312:1](sbe38241.htm#fr_198) I. e. we must not think that because they enjoin\nthe 'nityata' of certain works, other passages may not enjoin the same works\nas mere means of knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 33](sbe38242.htm)\n\n"
