D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n\xc2\xa7 10\\. Brahma is Absolute Being.--The question whether the universal\nsubstrate, or Brahma, should properly be called being _(sat)_ or non-being\n_(a-sat)_ , already agitated the Vedic poets (see \xe1\xb9\x9aig veda, x. cxxix. 1), and\npassed through the schools of the Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as to those of the older Upanishads.\nThe debate, however, was merely over words. As Brahma is beyond all the\nlimiting conditions of phenomenal being, either term may be applied to it; it\nis at once metaphysically existent and empirically non-existent.\n\nBrahma is _non-being,_ B.A. II. iii. 1, Ch. III. xix. 1, Taitt. II. vi.-vii.;\n_being,_ Ch. VI. ii. 1, etc. Brahma is "reality of reality," B.A. II. i. 20,\niii. 6; "the Eternal cloaked in (empirical) reality," I. vi. 3. A\nreconciliation from the transcendental standpoint is found in \xc5\x9avet. IV. 18, v.\n1, Mu\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d. II. ii. 1, etc. \xc5\x9aankara (on Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra, I. iv. 14 f.) rightly notes\nthe twofold meaning of the terms "being" and "not-being."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Brahma is Thought](brk14.htm)\n\n'
