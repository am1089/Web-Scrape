Wilkins, [1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n##### KAMADEVA.\n\nK\xc4\x81madeva, the Indian Cupid, is generally regarded as the son of Vishnu and\nLakshmi, under the forms of Krishna and Rukmini, but he is also described in\nsome places as a son of Brahm\xc4\x81. The latter account of his origin arises\nprobably from the following. In the "Rig-Veda," * Kama is described as the\nfirst movement that arose in the One, after it had come into life through the\npower of fervour or abstraction. In the "Atharva-Veda," this Kama or desire,\nnot of sexual enjoyment, but of good in general, is celebrated as a great\npower superior to all the gods, and is supplicated for deliverance from\nenemies. According to one hymn in the "Rig-Veda," Kama is worshipped and said\nto be unequalled by the gods; according to another, he is the god of sexual\nlove, like Eros of the Greeks, and Cupid of the Latins. In\n\np. 257\n\nthe latter aspect he is thus addressed: "May K\xc4\x81ma, having well directed the\narrow, which is winged with pain, barbed with longing, and has desire for its\nshaft, pierce thee in the heart." It is in this character that he appears in\nthe Pur\xc4\x81nas.\n\nKama is known in Hindu mythology as a victim of Siva\'s anger. A demon named\nT\xc4\x81raka, having greatly distressed the gods, they wished to destroy him. But\nonly a son of Siva could accomplish this. In consequence of his intense grief\nat the loss of his wife Sati, Siva had\n\n[![K\xc4\x80MADEVA.](tn/25700.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/25700.jpg)  \nK\xc4\x80MADEVA.  \n\nunfortunately become insensible to love. The gods therefore instigated Kama to\nassist by wounding him with his arrows. At last he was successful, just as\nP\xc4\x81rvati (Sati in a new form) was near, who at once captivated the stricken\ndeity. Angry with Kama for his presumption, he caused a flame to issue from\nhis third eye, which consumed the god who had interrupted his devotions. In\nthe "Vamana Pur\xc4\x81na" * is a lengthy account of the effect of K\xc4\x81ma\'s arrows. The\nwounded\n\np. 258\n\ngod could find no rest. He threw himself in the Kalindi river, but "the waters\nwere dried up and changed into blackness; and ever since, its dark stream,\nthough holy, has flown through the forest like the string that binds a\nmaiden\'s hair." As he wandered about from place to place seeking relief, the\nwives of the saints in the forest of Daruvanam forsook their homes and\nfollowed him.\n\n[![SIVA SLAYING K\xc4\x80MADEVA.](tn/25800.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/25800.jpg)  \nSIVA SLAYING K\xc4\x80MADEVA.  \n\nThis led their husbands to curse Siva, who, being enraged at the evil Kama had\ndone to him, consumed him.\n\nThe Bh\xc4\x81gavata * continues the story as follows:--Rati, the wife of K\xc4\x81ma, being\nalmost mad with grief at the loss of her husband, entreated P\xc4\x81rvati to\nintercede with Siva that he might restore him to life. P\xc4\x81rvati encourages her\nby showing how her wish will\n\np. 259\n\nbe gratified. " He will be born as the son of Sri Krishna, and his name will\nbe Pradyumna. A demon named Sambara will carry him off and cast him into the\nsea. Having entered the body of a fish, he will re-appear in the food of\nSambara. Go, take up your abode in the house of Sambara, and when your husband\narrives, take him and bring him up; eventually he will slay Sambara and will\nlive happily with you." Acting on this advice, Rati became a servant in the\nhouse of the demon.\n\nFrom the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" * we gather the completion of this story: When\nPradyumna was but six days old, he was stolen from the lying-in chamber by\nSambara, terrible as death; for the demon knew (having been told by the sage\nN\xc4\x81rada) that Pradyumna, if he lived would be his destroyer. Sambara cast him\ninto the sea, the haunt of the huge creatures of the deep. A large fish\nswallowed him, and he was born again from his body: for the fish was caught by\nfishermen and by them delivered to the great asura, Sambara. His wife M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81devi\n(the Bh\xc4\x81gavata says, servant), the mistress of his household, superintended\nthe operations of the cooks, and, when the fish was cut open, saw a beautiful\nchild.\n\nWhilst wondering who this could be, and how it came there, N\xc4\x81rada appeared to\nsatisfy her curiosity, and said to the graceful dame: "This is the son of him\nby whom the whole world is created and destroyed; the son of Vishnu, who was\nstolen by Sambara from the lying-in chamber, and tossed by him into the sea,\nwhere he was swallowed by the fish. He is now in thy power; do thou, beautiful\nwoman, tenderly rear the jewel of mankind." Thus counselled by N\xc4\x81rada,\nM\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81devi took charge of the boy, and carefully reared him from childhood,\nbeing fascinated by the beauty of his person. The\n\np. 260\n\naffection became still more impassioned when he was decorated with the bloom\nof adolescence. The gracefully-moving M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81devi, then fixing her heart and eyes\nupon the high-minded Pradyumna, gave him, whom she regarded as herself, all\nher magic and illustrative arts.\n\n"Observing these. marks of passionate affection, the son of Krishna said to\nthe lotus-eyed M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81devi: \'Why do you indulge in feelings so unbecoming the\ncharacter of a mother? " To which she replied: \'Thou art not a son of mine;\nthou art the son of Vishnu, whom K\xc4\x81la Sambara carried away and threw into the\nsea; thou wast swallowed by a fish, but wast rescued by me from its belly. Thy\nfond mother is still weeping for thee.\' When the valiant Pradyumna heard this,\nhe was filled with wrath, and defied Sambara to battle. In the conflict the\nson of M\xc4\x81dhava slew the hosts of Sambara. Seven times he foiled the delusions\nof the enchanter, and, making himself master of the eighth, turned it against\nSambara and killed him. By the same faculty he ascended into the air, and\nproceeded to his father\'s house, where he alighted, along with M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81vati, in\nthe inner apartments. When the women beheld Pradyumna, they thought it was\nKrishna himself. Rukmini, her eyes dimmed with tears, spoke tenderly to him,\nand said: \'Happy is she who has a son like this, in the bloom of youth. Such\nwould be the age of my Pradyumna, if he were alive. Who is the fortunate\nmother adorned by thee? And yet from thy appearance, and from the affection I\nfeel for thee, thou art assuredly the son of Hari.\'\n\n"At this moment Krishna and N\xc4\x81rada arrived; and the latter said to Rukmini:\n\'This is thine own son, who has come hither after killing Sambara, by whom\nwhen an infant he was stolen. This is the virtuous M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81vati,\n\np. 261\n\nhis wife, and not the wife of Sambara. Hear the reason. When Manmatha (K\xc4\x81ma),\nthe deity of love, perished, the goddess of beauty, desirous to secure his\nrevival, assumed a delusive form, and by her charms fascinated the demon\nSambara, and exhibited herself to him in various illusory enjoyments. This thy\nson is the descended Kama; and this is the goddess Rati, his wife.\'"\n\nKama is usually represented as a beautiful youth, holding in his hands a bow\nand arrows of flowers. He travels about through the three worlds accompanied\nby his wife Rati, the cuckoo, the humming-bee, spring personified, and gentle\nbreezes. Although in Bengal no images are made to represent him, he is\nworshipped at the time of marriage, and happiness in the married state, and\noffspring, are sought from him. Part of the hymn referred to above from the\n"Atharva-Veda" is recited in the Hindu marriage ritual.\n\nKama has many names indicative of the influence he is supposed to exert\namongst men. Amongst others may be mentioned:--\n\nMadan, "He who intoxicates with love."\n\nManmatha, "He who agitates the mind."\n\nMara, "He who wounds."\n\nPradyumna, "He who conquers all."\n\nAnanga, "He who is without a body."\n\nKushumesu, "He whose arrows are flowers."\n\n![](img/26100.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[256:*](hmvp32.htm#fr_230) Muir, O.
