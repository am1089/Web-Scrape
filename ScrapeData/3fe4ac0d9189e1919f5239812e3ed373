To the mighty, sacrificial Agni, to the bull of _Ri_ ta\n[1](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:1:1), the Asura, I bring this prayer and this song,\nwhich is turned towards him, to (him) the bull, as well-clarified gh _ri_ ta\n(is poured) into his mouth at the sacrifice.\n\n2\\. O knower of _Ri_ ta, know the _Ri_ ta! Bore for many streams of _Ri_ ta. I\n(do) not (serve) a Yatu [1](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:2:1) by violence nor by\nfalsehood; I serve the _Ri_ ta of the red bull [2](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:2:2).\n\n3\\. How, O Agni, performing the _Ri_ ta through _Ri_ ta, mayst thou become a\nwitness of our newest [1](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:3:1) hymn? The god, the\nprotector of the seasons, knows of my seasons [2](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:3:2). I\n(do) not (know another) lord but him who attains (for us) this wealth.\n\n4\\. Who, O Agni, are thy fetterers to (fetter) the impostor\n[1](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:4:1)? What brilliant guardians were successful? Who,\nO Agni, drink the drink of falsehood? Who are the protectors of untrue speech?\n\n5\\. These friends of thine, O Agni, turning themselves from (thee)\n[1](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:5:1), they who had been kind, have become unkind.\nThey have harmed themselves by their own speeches, uttering wrong words to the\nrighteous.\n\n6\\. He who magnifies thy sacrifice, O Agni, by adoration, and serves\n[1](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:6:1) the _Ri_ ta of the red bull: may a large, good\ndwelling come to him, to the offspring of the advancing Nahusha.\n\np. 394\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi; the metre is Trish _t_ ubh.--No verse of this hymn occurs\nin the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The genitive _ri_ tasya seems to depend on v _r i_sh _n_ e, not on\nmanma. On the connection of Agni with the _Ri_ ta, see Bergaigne, III, 229\nseq.; H. O., Religion des Veda, 201.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. A bad demon.\n\nNote 2. Of Agni.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. I think that navya _h_ stands for navyasa _h_. Thus Ludwig translates:\n'des neuen liedes.' It seems evident that it is not the nominative of navya,\n'praiseworthy' (Bohtlingk-Roth, Grassmann).\n\nNote 2. Probably we ought to read _ri_ tapa\xc2\xb4 _ri_ ta\xc2\xb4nam. Cf. IV, 23, 4. deva\n_h_ bhuvat naveda _h_ me rita\xc2\xb4nam, and see III, 20, 4, note 1 (above, [p.\n282](sbe46080.htm#page_282)). The translation will be: 'The god, the protector\nof _Ri_ ta, knows of my (deeds of) _Ri_ ta.'\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Or ripava _h_? 'Who, O Agni, are the impostors who fetter thee?'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. On vishu _n_ a _h_ , compare V, 34, 6: asunvata _h_ vishu _n_ a _h_\nsunvata _h_ v _ri_ dha _h_.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The second verse ( _ri_ tam sapami arushasya v _r i_sh _n_ a _h_ )\nshows with evidence that for sa pati we ought to read sapati (see Roth, Kuhn's\nZeitschrift, XXVI, 49, and compare on the expression _ri_ tam sap, Geldner,\nVedische Studien, II, 135).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 13](sbe46117.htm)\n\n"
