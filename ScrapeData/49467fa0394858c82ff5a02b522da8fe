Whatever Natures be  \nTo mortal men distributed, those natures spring from Me!  \nIntellect, skill, enlightenment, endurance, self-control,  \nTruthfulness, equability, and grief or joy of soul,  \nAnd birth and death, and fearfulness, and fearlessness, and shame,  \nAnd honour, and sweet harmlessness, and peace which is the same  \nWhate\'er befalls, and mirth, and tears, and piety and thrift,  \nAnd wish to give, and will to help,- all cometh of My gift!  \nThe Seven Chief Saints, the Elders Four, the Lordly Manus set-  \nSharing My work- to rule the worlds, these too did I beget;  \nAnd Rishis, Pitris, Manus, all, by one thought of My mind;  \nThence did arise, to fill this world, the races of mankind;  \nWherefrom who comprehends My Reign of mystic Majesty-  \nThat truth of truths- is thenceforth linked in faultless faith to  \nMe:  \nYea! knowing Me the source of all, by Me all creatures wrought,  \nThe wise in spirit cleave to Me, into My Being brought;  \nHearts fixed on Me; breaths breathed to Me; praising Me, each to  \neach,  \nSo have they happiness and peace, with pious thought and speech;  \nAnd unto these- thus serving well, thus loving ceaselessly-  \nI give a mind of perfect mood, whereby they draw to Me;  \nAnd, all for love of them, within their darkened souls I dwell,  \nAnd, with bright rays of wisdom\'s lamp, their ignorance dispel.  \nArjuna. Yes! Thou art Parabrahm! The High Abode!  \nThe Great Purification! Thou art God  \nEternal, All-creating, Holy, First,  \nWithout beginning! Lord of Lords and Gods!  \nDeclared by all the Saints- by Narada,  \nVyasa Asita, and Devalas;  \nAnd here Thyself declaring unto me!  \nWhat Thou hast said now know I to be truth,  \nO Kesava! that neither gods nor men  \nNor demons comprehend Thy mystery  \nMade manifest, Divinest! Thou Thyself  \nThyself alone dost know, Maker Supreme!  \nMaster of all the living! Lord of Gods!  \nKing of the Universe! To Thee alone  \nBelongs to tell the heavenly excellence  \nOf those perfections wherewith Thou dost fill  \nThese worlds of Thine; Pervading, Immanent!  \nHow shall I learn, Supremest Mystery!  \nTo know Thee, though I muse continually?  \nUnder what form of Thine unnumbered forms  \nMayst Thou be grasped? Ah! yet again recount,  \nClear and complete, Thy great appearances,  \nThe secrets of Thy Majesty and Might,  \nThou High Delight of Men! Never enough  \nCan mine ears drink the Amrit of such words!  \nKrishna. Hanta! So be it! Kuru Prince! I will to thee unfold  \nSome portions of My Majesty, whose powers are manifold!  \nI am the Spirit seated deep in every creature\'s heart;  \nFrom Me they come; by Me they live; at My word they depart!  \nVishnu of the Adityas I am, those Lords of Light;  \nMaritchi of the Maruts, the Kings of Storm and Blight;  \nBy day I gleam, the golden Sun of burning cloudless Noon;  \nBy Night, amid the asterisms I glide, the dappled Moon!  \nOf Vedas I am Sama-Ved, of gods in Indra\'s Heaven  \nVasava; of the faculties to living beings given  \nThe mind which apprehends and thinks; of Rudras Sankara;  \nOf Yakshas and of Rakshasas, Vittesh; and Pavaka  \nOf Vasus, and of mountain-peaks Meru; Vrihaspati  \nKnow Me \'mid planetary Powers; \'mid Warriors heavenly  \nSkanda; of all the water-floods the Sea which drinketh each,  \nAnd Bhrigu of the holy Saints, and OM of sacred speech;  \nOf prayers the prayer ye whisper; of hills Himila\'s snow,  \nAnd Aswattha, the fig-tree, of all the trees that grow;  \nOf the Devarshis, Narada; and Chitrarath of them  \nThat sing in Heaven, and Kapila of Munis, and the gem  \nOf flying steeds, Uchchaisravas, from Amritwave which burst;  \nOf elephants Airavata; of males the Best and First;  \nOf weapons Heav\'n\'s hot thunderbolt; of cows white Kamadhuk,  \nFrom whose great milky udder-teats all hearts\' desires are strook;  \nVasuki of the serpent-tribes, round Mandara entwined;  \nAnd thousand-fanged Ananta, on whose broad coils reclined  \nLeans Vishnu; and of water-things Varuna; Aryam  \nOf Pitris, and, of those that judge, Yama the Judge I am;  \nOf Daityas dread Prahlada; of what metes days and years,  \nTime\'s self I am; of woodland-beasts- buffaloes, deers, and bears-  \nThe lordly-painted tiger; of birds the vast Garud,  \nThe whirlwind \'mid the winds; \'mid chiefs Rama with blood imbrued,  \nMakar \'mid fishes of the sea, and Ganges \'mid the streams;  \nYea! First, and Last, and Centre of all which is or seems  \nI am, Arjuna! Wisdom Supreme of what is wise,  \nWords on the uttering lips I am, and eyesight of the eyes.  \nAnd "A" of written characters, Dwandwa of knitted speech,  \nAnd Endless Life, and boundless Love, whose power  \nsustaineth each;  \nAnd bitter Death which seizes all, and joyous sudden Birth,  \nWhich brings to light all beings that are to be on earth;  \nAnd of the viewless virtues, Fame, Fortune, Song am I,  \nAnd Memory, and Patience; and Craft, and Constancy:  \nOf Vedic hymns the Vrihatsam, of metres Gayatri,  \nOf months the Margasirsha, of all the seasons three  \nThe flower-wreathed Spring; in dicer\'s-play the conquering  \nDouble-Eight;  \nThe splendour of the splendid, and the greatness of the great,  \nVictory I am, and Action! and the goodness of the good,  \nAnd Vasudev of Vrishni\'s race, and of this Pandu brood  \nThyself!- Yea, my Arjuna! thyself; for thou art Mine!  \nOf poets Usana, of saints Vyasa, sage divine;  \nThe policy of conquerors, the potency of kings,  \nThe great unbroken silence in learning\'s secret things;  \nThe lore of all the learned, the seed of all which springs.  \nLiving or lifeless, still or stirred, whatever beings be,  \nNone of them is in all the worlds, but it exists by Me!  \nNor tongue can tell, Arjuna! nor end of telling come  \nOf these My boundless glories, whereof I teach thee some;  \nFor wheresoe\'er is wondrous work, and majesty, and might,  \nFrom Me hath all proceeded. Receive thou this aright!  \nYet how shouldst thou receive, O Prince! the vastness of this word?  \nI, who am all, and made it all, abide its separate Lord!\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER X OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Vibhuti Yog,"  \nOr "The Book of Religion by the Heavenly Perfections."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 11: Of the Manifesting of the One and Manifold](bg11.htm)\n\n'
