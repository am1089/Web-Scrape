[2](ry363.htm#fn_836)  \nO lady of the lovely smile,  \nWhose eyes the sternest heart beguile,  \nIn all thy radiant beauty dressed  \nMy heart and soul thou ravishest.  \nWhat though thy robe is soiled and worn,  \nAnd no bright gems thy limbs adorn,  \nThou unadorned art dearer far  \nThan all my loveliest consorts are.  \nMy royal home is bright and fair;  \nA thousand beauties meet me there.  \nBut come, my glorious love, and be  \nThe queen of all those dames and me.\'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[406:1b](ry362.htm#fr_833) Ravan in his magic car carrying off the most\nbeautiful women reminds us of the magician in _Orlando Furioso_ , possesor of\nthe flying horse.  \n"Volando talor s\'aza ne le stelle, *  \nE por quasis talor \'a terra rade\'; *  \nBie porta con tui tutte le belle *  \nDonna che trova perquelle contrade." *  \n\n[406:2b](ry362.htm#fr_834) Indian women twisted their long hair in a single\nbraid as a sign of mourning for their absent husbands.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXI.: Sita\'s Scorn.](ry363.htm)\n\n'
