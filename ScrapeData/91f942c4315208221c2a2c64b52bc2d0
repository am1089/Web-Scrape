All worlds are contained in it, and no\none goes beyond. This is that.\'\n\n2\\. \'Whatever there is, the whole world, when gone forth (from the Brahman),\ntrembles in its breath 5. That Brahman is a great terror, like a drawn sword.\nThose who know it become immortal.\'\n\n3\\. \'From terror of Brahman fire burns, from terror the sun burns, from terror\nIndra and Vayu, and Death, as the fifth, run away 6.\'\n\n4\\. \'If a man could not understand it before the falling asunder of his body,\nthen he has to take body again in the worlds of creation 7.\'\n\np. 22\n\n5\\. \'As in a mirror, so (Brahman may be seen clearly) here in this \'body; as\nin a dream, in the world of the Fathers; as in the water, he is seen about in\nthe world of the Gandharvas; as in light and shade 1, in the world of Brahma.\'\n\n6\\. \'Having understood that the senses are distinct 2 (from the \xc3\x82tman), and\nthat their rising and setting (their waking and sleeping) belongs to them in\ntheir distinct existence (and not to the \xc3\x82tman), a wise man grieves no more.\'\n\n7\\. \'Beyond. the senses is the mind, beyond the mind is the highest (created)\nBeing 3, higher than that Being is the Great Self, higher than the Great, the\nhighest Undeveloped.\'\n\n8\\. \'Beyond the Undeveloped is the Person, the all-pervading and entirely\nimperceptible. Every creature that knows him is liberated, and obtains\nimmortality.\'\n\n9\\. \'His form is not to be seen, no one beholds him with the eye. He is\nimagined by the heart, by wisdom, by the mind. Those who know this, are\nimmortal 4.\'\n\n10\\. \'When the five instruments of knowledge stand still together with the\nmind, and when the intellect does not move, that is called the highest state.\'\n\n11\\. \'This, the firm holding back of the senses, is what is called Yoga. He\nmust be free from thoughtlessness then, for Yoga comes and goes 5.\'\n\np. 23\n\n12\\. \'He (the Self) cannot be reached by speech, by mind, or by the eye. How\ncan it be apprehended except by him who says: "He is?"\'\n\n13\\. \'By the words "He is," is he to be apprehended, and by (admitting) the\nreality of both (the invisible Brahman and the visible world, as coming from\nBrahman). When he has been apprehended by the words "He is," then his reality\nreveals itself\'\n\n14\\. \'When all desires that dwell in his heart cease, then the mortal becomes\nimmortal, and obtains Brahman.\'\n\n15\\. \'When all the ties 1 of the heart are severed here on earth, then the\nmortal becomes immortal--here ends the teaching 2.\'\n\n\n\n116\\. \'There are a hundred and one arteries of the heart 3, one of them\npenetrates the crown of the head 4. Moving upwards by it, a man (at his death)\nreaches the Immortal 5; the other arteries serve for departing in different\ndirections.\'\n\n17\\. \'The Person not larger than a thumb, the inner Self, is always settled in\nthe heart of men 6. Let a man draw that Self forth from his body with\nsteadiness,\n\np. 24\n\nas one draws the pith from a reed 1. Let him know that Self as the Bright, as\nthe Immortal; yes, as the Bright, as the Immortal 2.\'\n\n18\\. Having received this knowledge taught by Death and the whole rule of Yoga\n(meditation), [Na _k_ iketa](errata.htm#1) became free from passion 3 and\ndeath, and obtained Brahman. Thus it will be with another also who knows thus\nwhat relates to the Self.\n\n19\\. May He protect us both! May He enjoy us both! May we acquire Strength\ntogether! May our knowledge become bright! May we never quarrel 4! Om! Peace!\npeace! peace! Harih, Om!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[21:1](sbe15015.htm#fr_132) The fig-tree which sends down its branches so that\nthey strike root and form new stems, one tree growing into a complete forest.\n\n[21:2](sbe15015.htm#fr_133) Cf.

V, 8.\n\n[21:4](sbe15015.htm#fr_135) The commentator says that the tree is the world,\nand its root is Brahman, but there is nothing to support this view in the\noriginal, where tree, roots, and branches are taken together as representing\nthe Brahman in its various manifestations.\n\n[21:5](sbe15015.htm#fr_136) According to the commentator, in the highest\nBrahman.\n\n[21:6](sbe15015.htm#fr_137) Cf. Taitt. Up. II, 8, 1.\n\n[21:7](sbe15015.htm#fr_138) The commentator translates: \'If a man is able to\nunderstand (Brahman), then even before the decay of his body, he is liberated.\nIf he is not able to understand it, then he has to take body again in the\ncreated worlds.\' I doubt whether it is possible to supply so much, and should\nprefer to read iha _k_ en na _s_ akad, though I find it difficult to explain\nhow so simple a text should have been misunderstood and corrupted.\n\n[22:1](sbe15015.htm#fr_139) Roer: \'As in a picture and in the sunshine!\n\n[22:2](sbe15015.htm#fr_140) They arise from the elements, ether, &c.\n\n[22:3](sbe15015.htm#fr_141) Buddhi or intellect, cf.

What follows has reference, according to\nthe commentator, not to him who knows the highest Brahman, for he becomes\nBrahman at once and migrates no more; but to him who does not know the highest\nBrahman fully, and therefore migrates to the Brahmaloka, receiving there the\nreward for his partial knowledge and for his good works.\n\n[23:3](sbe15015.htm#fr_146) Cf. _Kh_ and.
