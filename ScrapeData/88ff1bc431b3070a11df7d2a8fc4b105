After having seen Sri (Lakshmi), the goddess of the earth, highly pleased,\nquestioned (in the following manner) that goddess, who was stroking the feet\nof Vish _n_ u, the god of the gods, who was shining with the splendour of her\nausterities, and whose face was radiant like melted gold.\n\n2\\. 'O charming lady! Thy hands are as beautiful as the expanded red lotus.\nThou art holding the feet of him whose navel resembles the expanded red lotus.\nThou art constantly residing in an abode resembling the expanded red lotus.\nThy waist has the colour of the expanded red lotus.\n\n3\\. 'Thy eyes resemble blue lotus-flowers; thy hue is radiant like gold; thy\nrobe is white; thy body is adorned with gems; thy face is radiant like the\nmoon; thou art resplendent like the sun; thy power is immense; thou art the\nsovereign (or producer) of the world.\n\n4\\. 'Thou art repose (final liberation), the highest among the (four) objects\nof human pursuit; thou art Lakshmi; thou art a support (in danger); thou art\n_S_ ri; thou art indifference (the freedom from all worldly pursuits and\nappetites, which is the consequence of final emancipation); thou art victory;\n\n[4. The 'four objects of human pursuit' are, kama, 'desire' (and its\ngratification), artha, 'gain,' dharma, 'religious merit,' and moksha, 'final\nemancipation.' The goddess is called Lakshmi, because she is the aim\n(lakshyate) of all beings. She is called _S_ ri, because she serves\nPurushottama (Vish _n_ u), or because she is the resort of all. (Nand.)]\n\np. 298\n\nthou art beauty; thou art the splendour (of the sun and moon personified);\nthou art renown; thou art prosperity; thou art wisdom; thou art the power of\nexpression; thou art the Purifier.\n\n5\\. 'Thou art the food of the manes; thou art forbearance; thou art the earth\n(or the repository of wealth); thou art fixity; thou art the basis (or\nstability); thou art the source of the benefit derived from sacrifices; thou\nart highest prudence; thou art wide-spread renown; thou art freedom from envy;\nthou art the food given to the gods; thou art mental power; thou art\nintelligence.\n\n6\\. 'As the first of the gods (Vish _n_ u) pervades the whole aggregate of the\nthree worlds (sky, atmosphere, and earth), even so doest thou, O black-eyed\nbestower of gifts. Yet I inquire for the dwelling, in which thy superhuman\npower is residing.'\n\n7\\. The goddess of the earth having thus spoken to her, Lakshmi, standing by\nthe side of the chief of the gods, enunciated the following answer: 'I am\nconstantly at the side of the brilliant destroyer of Madhu, O goddess, who\nshinest like gold.\n\n8\\. 'But learn from me, where I reside (besides), O support of the world, from\nthe instruction of him, whom I am constantly reflecting upon in my mind, and\nwhom the virtuous call the husband of _S_ ri, and from my own recollection.\n\n9\\. 'I reside in the sun, in the moon, and in the cloudless atmosphere in\nwhich the flock of the stars is spread out. (I reside) in that cloud, from\nwhich the waters of the rain pour down, in that cloud\n\n[6. Lakshmi is said to pervade everything, like Vish _n_ u himself, because\nshe is his Sakti, i. e. his energy or active power personified as his wife.\n(Nand.)]\n\np. 299\n\nwhich is adorned with Indra's bow and in that cloud from which the rays of\nlightning flash forth.\n\n10\\.
