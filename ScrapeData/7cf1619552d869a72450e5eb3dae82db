The authors of the Prati _s_ akhyas have\nelaborated a most complicated system. Counting the syllables in the most\nmechanical manner, they have assigned nearly a hundred names to every variety\nwhich they discovered in the hymns of the Rig-veda a. But they also observed\nthat the constituent elements of all these metres were really but four,\n(Sutras 988, 989):\n\n1\\. The Gayatra pada, of eight syllables, ending in  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84.\n\n2\\. The Vaira _g_ a pada, of ten syllables, ending in  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84.\n\n3\\. The Traish _t_ ubha pada, of eleven syllables, ending in  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84.\n\n4\\. The _G_ agata pada, of twelve syllables, ending in  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84.\n\nThen follows an important rule, Sutra 990: 'The penultimate syllable,' he\nsays, in a Gayatra and _G_ agata pada is light (laghu), in a Vaira _g_ a and\nTraish _t_ ubha pada heavy (guru).' This is called their v _ri_ tta.\n\nThis word v _ri_ tta, which is generally translated by metre, had evidently\noriginally a more special meaning. It meant the final rhythm, or if we take it\nliterally, the V _ri_ tta = versus. turn of a line, for it is derived from v\n_ri_ t, to turn. Hence v _ri_ tta is the same word as the Latin versus, verse;\nbut I do not wish to decide whether the connection between the two words is\nhistorical, or simply etymological. In Latin, versus is always supposed to\nhave meant originally a furrow, then a line, then a verse. In Sanskrit the\nmetaphor that led to the formation of v _ri_ tta, in the sense of final\nrhythm, has nothing to do with ploughing. If, as I have tried to prove (Chips\nfrom a German Workshop,\n\np. xcvi\n\nvol. i, p. 84), the names assigned to metres and metrical language were\nderived from words originally referring to choregic movements, v _ri_ tta must\nhave meant the turn, i. e. the last step of any given movement; and this turn,\nas determining the general character of the whole movement, would naturally be\nregulated by more severe rules, while greater freedom would be allowed for the\nrest.\n\nHaving touched on this subject, I may add another fact in support of my view.\nThe words Trish _t_ ubh and Anush _t_ ubh, names for the most common metres,\nare generally derived from a root stubh, to praise. I believe they should be\nderived from a root stubh, which is preserved in Greek, not only in \xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xcf\x85\xcf\x86\xce\xb5\xce\xbb\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82,\nhard, \xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xcf\x85\xcf\x86\xce\xb5\xce\xbb\xce\xaf\xce\xb6\xcf\x89, to strike hard, but in the root \xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xce\xbc\xcf\x86, from which \xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xbc\xcf\x86\xcf\x85\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xce\xbd,\nstamped or pressed olives or grapes, and \xe1\xbc\x80\xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xce\xb5\xce\xbc\xcf\x86\xe1\xbd\xb5\xcf\x82, untrodden (grapes), then\nunshaken; and in \xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xbc\xce\xb2\xcf\x89, to shake, to ram, \xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xce\xb2\xe1\xbd\xb3\xcf\x89, to scold, &c. In Sanskrit\nthis root is mentioned in the Dhatupa _th_ a X, 34, shtubhu stambhe, and it\nexists in a parallel form as stambh, lit. to stamp down, then to fix, to make\nfirm, with which Bopp has compared the German stampfen, to stamp; (Glossarium,\ns. v. stambh.) I therefore look upon Trish _t_ ubh as meaning originally\ntripudium, (supposing this word to be derived from tri and pes, according to\nthe expression in Horace, pepulisse ter pede terram, Hor. Od. iii. i8,) and I\nexplain its name 'Three-step,' by the fact that the three last syllables  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\n\xcc\x86, which form the characteristic feature of that metre, and may be called its\nreal v _ri_ tta or turn, were audibly stamped at the end of each turn or\nstrophe. I explain Anush _t_ ubh, which consists of four equal padas, each of\neight syllables, as the 'After-step,' because each line was stamped regularly\nafter the other, possibly by two choruses, each side taking its turn. There is\none passage in the Veda where Anush _t_ ubh seems to have preserved this\nmeaning:\n\nX, 124, 9. anu-stubham anu _k_ ar _k_ uryama _n_ am indram ni _k_ ikyu _h_\nkavaya _h_ manisha\xc2\xb4.\n\nPoets by their wisdom discovered Indra dancing to an Anush _t_ ubh.\n\nIn V, 52, 12, _kh_ anda _h_ -stubha _h_ kubhanyava _h_ utsam a\xc2\xb4\n\np. xcvii\n\nkiri _n_ a _h_ n _ri_ tu _h_ , in measured steps (i. e. stepping the metre)\nand wildly shouting the gleemen have danced toward the spring.\n\nOther names of metres which point to a similar origin, i. e. to their original\nconnection with dances, are Pada-pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti, 'Step-row;' Nya\xe1\xb9\x85ku-sari _n_ i, 'Roe-\nstep;' Abhisari _n_ i, 'Contre-danse,' &c.\n\nIf now we return to the statement of the Prati _s_ akhya in reference to the v\n_ri_ ttas, we should observe how careful its author is in his language. He\ndoes not say that the penultimate is long or short, but he simply states,\nthat, from a metrical point of view, it must be considered as light or heavy,\nwhich need not mean more than that it must be pronounced with or without\nstress. The fact that the author of the Prati _s_ akhya uses these terms,\nlaghu and guru, instead of hrasva, short, and dirgha, long, shows in fact that\nhe was aware that the penultimate in these padas is not invariably long or\nshort, though, from a metrical point of view, it is always heavy or light.\n\nIt is perfectly true that if we keep to these four padas, (to which one more\npada, viz. the half Vaira _g_ a, consisting of five syllables, might be added)\nwe can reduce nearly all the hymns of the Rig-veda to their simple elements\nwhich the ancient poets combined together, in general in a very simple way,\nbut occasionally with greater freedom. The most important strophes, formed out\nof these padas, are,\n\n1\\. Three Gayatra padas = the Gayatri, (24 syllables.)\n\n2\\. Four Gayatra padas = the Anush _t_ ubh, (32 syllables.)\n\n3\\. Four Vaira _g_ a padas = the Vira _g_ , (40 syllables.)\n\n4\\. Four Traish _t_ ubha padas = the Trish _t_ ubh, (44 syllables.)\n\n5\\. Four _G_ agata padas = the _G_ agati, (48 syllables.)\n\nBetween the Gayatri and Anush _t_ ubh strophes, another strophe may be formed,\nby mixture of Gayatra and _G_ agata padas, consisting of 28 syllables, and\ncommonly called Ush _n_ ih; likewise between the Anush _t_ ubh and the Vira\n_g_ , a strophe may be formed, consisting of 36 syllables, and commonly called\nB _ri_ hati.\n\nIn a collection of hymns, however, like that of the Rig-veda, where poems of\ndifferent ages, different places, and\n\np. xcviii\n\ndifferent families have been put together, we must be prepared for exceptions\nto many rules. Thus, although the final turn of the hendecasyllabic Traish _t_\nubha is, as a rule, the bacchius,  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84, yet if we take, for instance, the\n77th hymn of the tenth Ma _n_ _d_ ala, we clearly perceive another\nhendecasyllabic pada of a totally different structure, and worked up into one\nof the most beautiful strophes by an ancient poet. Each line is divided into\ntwo halves, the first consisting of seven syllables, being an exact\ncounterpart of the first member of a Saturnian verse (fato Romae Metelli); the\nsecond a dijambus, answering boldly to the broken rhythm of the first member\na. We have, in fact, a Trish _t_ ubh where the turn or the three-step,  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84\n\xcc\x84, instead of being at the end, stands in the middle of the line.\n\nX, 77, 1-5, in the Pada text:\n\n1\\. a\xcc\x84bhra\xcc\x84-pru\xcc\x86sha\xcc\x84 _h_ na\xcc\x86 va\xcc\x84 _k_ a\xcc\x84 \xcc\x8d pru\xcc\x86sha\xcc\x86\xcc\x85 va\xcc\x86su\xcc\x84,  \n   ha\xcc\x86vi\xcc\x84shma\xcc\x84nta\xcc\x84 _h_ na\xcc\x86 ya\xcc\x84 _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\xcc\x84 _h_  \xcc\x8d vi\xcc\x86- _g_ a\xcc\x84nu\xcc\x86sha\xcc\x84 _h_ | &c.\n\nAnother strophe, the nature of which has been totally misapprehended by native\nmetricians, occurs in IV, 10. It is there called Padapa\xe1\xb9\x85kti and\nMahapadapa\xe1\xb9\x85kti; nay, attempts have been made to treat it even as an Ush _n_\nih, or as a kind of Gayatri. The real character of that strophe is so palpable\nthat it is difficult to understand how it could have been mistaken. It\nconsists of two lines, the first embracing three or four feet of five\nsyllables each, having the ictus on the first and the fourth syllables, and\nresembling the last line of a Sapphic verse. The second line is simply\n\np. xcix\n\na Trish _t_ ubh. It is what we should call an asynartete strophe, and the\ncontrast of the rhythm in the first and second lines is very effective. I am\nnot certain whether Professor Bollensen, who has touched on this metre in an\narticle just published (Zeitschrift der D. M. G., vol. xxii, p. 572), shares\nthis opinion. He has clearly seen that the division of the lines, as given in\nthe MSS. of the Sa _m_ hita text, is wrong; but he seems inclined to admit the\nsame rhythm throughout, and to treat the strophe as consisting of four lines\nof five syllables each, and one of six syllables, which last line is to submit\nto the prevailing rhythm of the preceding lines. If we differ, however, as to\nthe internal architecture of this strophe, we agree in condemning the\ninterpretation proposed by the Prati _s_ akhya; and I should, in connection\nwith this, like to call attention to two important facts: first, that the Sa\n_m_ hita text, in not changing, for instance, the final t of martat, betrays\nitself as clearly later than the elaboration of the ancient theory of metres,\nlater than the invention of such a metre as the Padapa\xe1\xb9\x85kti; and secondly, that\nthe accentuation, too, of the Sa _m_ hita is thus proved to be posterior to\nthe establishment of these fanciful metrical divisions, and hence cannot\nthroughout claim so irrefragable an authority as certainly belongs to it in\nmany cases. I give the Sa _m_ hita text:\n\n1\\. A\xcc\x84gne\xcc\x84 ta\xcc\x86m a\xcc\x84dya\xcc\x84 | a\xcc\x84sva\xcc\x84 _m_ na\xcc\x86 sto\xcc\x84ma\xcc\x84i _h_ | kra\xcc\x86tu\xcc\x84 _m_ na\xcc\x86\nbha\xcc\x84dra\xcc\x84m,  \n         h _ri \xcc\x86_di\xcc\x84sp _ri \xcc\x86_ _s_ a\xcc\x86m _ri \xcc\x85_dhy\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84ma\xcc\x84 ta\xcc\x86 o\xcc\x84hai\xcc\x84 _h_.  \n2\\.

The question, however,\nis this, have we a right, or are we obliged, in cases where that syllable is\nnot either long or short, as it ought to be, so to alter the text, or so to\nchange the rules of pronunciation, that the penultimate may again be what we\nwish it to be?\n\nIf we begin with the Gayatra pada, we have not to read\n\np. c\n\nlong before we find that it would be hopeless to try to crush the Gayatri\nverses of the Vedic _Ri_ shis on this Gayatra Padas.Procrustean bed. Even\nProfessor Kuhn very soon perceived that this was impossible. He had to admit\nthat in the Gayatri the two first padas, at all events, were free from this\nrule, and though he tried to retain it for the third or final pada, he was\nobliged after a time to give it up even there. Again, it is perfectly true,\nthat in the third pada of the Gayatri, and in the second and fourth padas of\nthe Anush _t_ ubh strophe, greater care is taken by the poets to secure a\nshort syllable for the penultimate, but here, too, exceptions cannot be\nentirely removed. We have only to take such a single hymn as I, 27, and we\nshall see that it would be impossible to reduce it to the uniform standard of\nGayatri padas, all ending in a dijambus.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xcv:a](sbe3212.htm#fr_57) See Appendix to my edition of the Prati _s_ akhya,\np. ccclvi.\n\n[xcviii:a](sbe3212.htm#fr_58) Professor Kuhn (vol. iii, p. 450) is inclined to\nadmit the same metre as varying in certain hymns with ordinary Traish _t_ ubha\npadas, but the evidence he brings forward is hardly sufficient. Even if we\nobject to the endings  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84 and  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84, V, 33, 4, may be a _G_\nagata, with vyuha of dasa, the remark quoted from the Prati _s_ akhya being of\nno consequence on such points; and the same remedy would apply to V, 41, 5,\nwith vyuha of eshe. In VI, 47, 31, vyuha of a _s_ vapar _n_ ai _h_ ; in I, 33,\n9, vyuha of indra and rodasi; in II, 24, 5, vyuha of madbhi _h_ would produce\nthe same effect; while in I, 121, 8, we must either admit the Traish _t_ ubha\nv _ri_ tta  \xcc\x84  \xcc\x86  \xcc\x84 or scan dhu\xcc\x84ksh\xcc\x86a\xcc\x84n.
