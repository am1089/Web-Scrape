THE \xc3\x82GRAYA _N_ ESH _T_ I OR OFFERING OF FIRST-FRUITS.\n\nThis sacrifice is performed in spring and autumn--generally at new or full\nmoon--at the commencement of the harvest. The oblations, which, as a rule, are\nprepared from new grain (viz. barley in spring, and rice in autumn), consist\nof--1. a sacrificial cake contained on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni; 2.\na _k_ aru (mess of boiled grains) for the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ , prepared with\nwater or milk; and 3. a cake on one potsherd for heaven and earth. Katy. IV, 6\nand comm. According to the Paddhati, the offering of first-fruits takes place\nafter the new-moon offering, and before the full-moon offering. At the\nbeginning of the harvest of Panicum Frumentaceum ( _s_ yamaka), in the rainy\nseason or in autumn; and at that of bamboo\n\np. 370\n\nin summer, offerings of first-fruits are also made to Soma in the form of a\npotful of boiled _s_ yamaka or bamboo grains respectively.\n\n2:4:3:11\\. Now Kaho _d_ a Kaushitaki spake, 'This sap (of the plants) truly\nbelongs to those two, heaven and earth: having offered of this sap to the\ngods, we will eat it.' 'That is why the offering of first-fruits is\nperformed.'\n\n2:4:3:22\\. And Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya also spake:--The gods and the Asuras, both\nof them sprung from Pra _g_ apati, once contended for superiority. The Asuras\nthen defiled, partly by magic, partly with poison, both kinds of plants--those\non which men and beasts subsist--hoping that in this way they might over come\nthe gods. In consequence of this neither did men eat food, nor did beasts\ngraze; and from want of food these creatures well-nigh perished 1.\n\n2:4:3:33\\. Now the gods heard as to how these creatures were perishing from\nwant of food. They spake unto one another, 'Come, let us rid them 2 of\nthis!'--'By what means?'--'By means of the sacrifice.' By means of the\nsacrifice the gods then accomplished all that they wanted to accomplish 3; and\nso did the _Ri_ shis.\n\n2:4:3:44\\. They then said, 'To which of us shall this belong?' They did not\nagree (each of them exclaiming), 'Mine (it shall be)!' Not having come to an\nagreement, they said, 'Let us run a race for this (sacrifice): whichever of us\nbeats (the others), his it shall be!' 'So be it!' they said, and they ran a\nrace.\n\np. 371\n\n2:4:3:55\\. Indra and Agni won, and hence that Indra-Agni cake on twelve\npotsherds 1; Indra and Agni having won a share in it. And where Indra and Agni\nwere standing when they had won, thither all the gods followed them.\n\n2:4:3:66\\. Now, Indra and Agni are the Kshatra (nobility), and all the gods\n(or, the All-gods) are the Vi _s_ (common \xc3\x82ryan people); and wherever the\nKshatra conquers, there the Vi _s_ is allowed to share. Thus they (Indra and\nAgni) allowed the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ (the All-gods) a share (in the offering);\nand hence that pap of boiled (rice or barley) grain (offered) to the All-gods.\n\n2:4:3:77\\. 'Let him prepare it from old (grain) 2,' say some; 'for Indra and\nAgni are the Kshatra (and he should therefore use old grain for the Vai _s_\nvadeva pap) lest he (the sacrificer) should exalt (the Vi _s_ ) to the level\nof the Kshatra.' Nevertheless let both (the cake and _k_ aru) consist of new\n(grain); for (by the very fact that) the one is a cake and the other a pap,\nthe nobility is not equalled (by the people): hence they should both consist\nof new (grain).\n\n2:4:3:88\\. The All-gods spake, 'This sap (of the rice and barley plants) truly\nbelongs to those two, heaven and earth: let us, then, allow those two a share\nin it!' They accordingly assigned that share to them, to wit, the cake on one\npotsherd offered to heaven\n\np. 372\n\nand earth 1. This is why there is a cake on one potsherd (kapala) for heaven\nand earth. Now this (earth) is, doubtless, the cup (depository, kapala) of\nthat (sap) 2; and she indeed is one only: hence (the cake) consists of one\npotsherd.\n\n2:4:3:99\\. An offence (is thereby committed) by him 3; since, for whatever\ndeity sacrificial food may be taken out, the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (Agni, the\nmaker of good offering) is invariably allowed a share in it after (the\nrespective deity). But that (cake) he offers entire, and he does not cut off a\nportion for the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t this is an offence, and consequently (that\ncake), when offered, turns upside down.\n\n2:4:3:1010\\. Hence they say, 'That (cake) contained on one potsherd has turned\nupside down: it will throw the kingdom into disorder.' No offence (is,\nhowever, committed) by him, for the \xc3\x82havaniya is the support of oblations; and\nif, after reaching the \xc3\x82havaniya, (the cake) were to turn upside down ten\ntimes, he need not heed it. And if others ask as to who would care to incur\n(the result of) such a combination (of errors), let him offer nothing but\nbutter; for clarified butter is manifestly the sap of\n\np. 373\n\nthose two, heaven and earth, so that he thereby manifestly gladdens those two\nwith their own sap or essence: hence he need offer nothing but butter.\n\n2:4:3:1111\\. By performing that same sacrifice, the gods removed the magic\nspell as well as the poison from both kinds of plants,--those on which men and\nbeasts subsist; and henceforward the men ate food and the cattle grazed.\n\n2:4:3:1212\\. Now when he performs that sacrifice, he does so either for the\nreason that no one will then defile (the plants) either by magic or poison; or\nbecause the gods did so. And whatever share the gods assigned (to themselves),\nthat share he thereby makes over to them. Moreover, he thereby renders\nwholesome and faultless both kinds of plants,--those on which men and beasts\nsubsist; and these creatures subsist on those wholesome and faultless (plants)\nof his: this is why he performs that sacrifice.\n\n2:4:3:1313\\. The priests' fee for this (sacrifice) consists of the first-born\ncalf (of the season); for that is, as it were, the first-fruits (of the\ncattle). If he has already performed the new and full-moon offerings, let him\nfirst perform those offerings 1, and thereupon the present (offering of first-\nfruits). If, on the other hand, he has not yet performed (the new and full-\nmoon offerings), let them cook a _k_ atushpra _s_ ya 2 pap on the southern\nfire, and let the priests eat it.\n\np. 374\n\n2:4:3:1414\\. Verily, there are two kinds of gods: for the gods themselves,\nassuredly, are gods; and those priests who have studied, and teach Vedic lore,\nare the human gods. And in like manner as that is offered whereon the Vashat\nhas been pronounced, so is that (offering of first-fruits consecrated by the\nfeeding of the priests). Let him also, at this (sacrifice), give as much as is\nin his power, for no offering, they say, should be without a dakshi _n_ a. At\nthe Agnihotra (performed at the time of the \xc3\x82graya _n_ esh _t_ i) let him not\noffer (milk obtained from the eating of new corn) 1; for were he to offer such\nat the Agnihotra, he would cause a conflict (between the deities of the two\nofferings). The \xc3\x82graya _n_ a is one thing, and the Agnihotra is another: let\nhim, therefore, not offer (new material) at the Agnihotra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[370:1](sbe1254.htm#fr_825) The Ka _n_ va text has: Ta eta ubhayya _h_ pra _g_\na ana _s_ anena not parababhuvu _h_.\n\n[370:2](sbe1254.htm#fr_826) Viz. the plants, according to the reading of the\nKa _n_ va text: Hantasam oshadhina _m_ k _ri_ tya _m_ tvad visha _m_ tvad\napahanameti.\n\n[370:3](sbe1254.htm#fr_827) The Ka _n_ va text reads kalpyam instead of\nkalpam.\n\n[371:1](sbe1254.htm#fr_828) The MS. of the Ka _n_ va recension has: Tasmad\nesha aindragno da _s_ akapala _h_ purola _s_ o bhavati. The commentary on\nKaty. IV, 6, 1, on the other hand, makes it a cake on eleven potsherds.\n\n[371:2](sbe1254.htm#fr_829) Or, he may do so. Katy. IV, 6, 7 leaves the option\nbetween new and old grain.\n\n[372:1](sbe1254.htm#fr_830) This is a 'low-voiced' oblation, the invitatory\nand offering prayers thereat (with the exception of the concluding 'Vausha _t_\n' and 'Om') being pronounced in a low tone. See [p.\n171](sbe1228.htm#page_171), note [1](sbe1228.htm#fn_395); [p.\n192](sbe1231.htm#page_192), note [1](sbe1231.htm#fn_439).\n\n[372:2](sbe1254.htm#fr_831) The Ka _n_ va text has: 'The reason why it\nconsists of one kapala is that this earth is a kapala, and that she is one\nonly.'\n\n[372:3](sbe1254.htm#fr_832) The Ka _n_ va recension has as follows:--As to\nthis they say, 'It should not be a one-cup cake, (because) therein a neglect\nis (involved).' Even so (ida _m_ nu): for whatever deity they take out\nsacrificial food, the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t is invariably made to share in it\nafter (the respective deity). That (cake) they offer whole: this is\nconsequently a neglect. Moreover, it turns round (paryabhavati). As to this\nthey say, 'That (cake) has turned upside down,' &c.\n\n[373:1](sbe1254.htm#fr_833) I do not know how to account for the va. Saya _n_\na seems to take the passage thus:--'If he be a Soma-sacrificer, or if he be\nperforming the Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa, [let him first perform that sacrifice,\nand] let him then perform the present one.' The Oxford MS. of the Ka _n_ va\ntext has:--Etat tasya karma ya i _g_ ano va syad dar _s_ apur _n_ amasabhya\n_m_ va ya _g_ etatha yo 'ni _g_ ano 'nvaharyapa _k_ ana evaudanam _k_ atushpra\n_s_ yam pa _k_ et tam brahma _n_ ebhya upanidadhyat.\n\n[373:2](sbe1254.htm#fr_834) See II, 1, 4, 4 seq.\n\n[374:1](sbe1254.htm#fr_835) Katy. has the rules IV, 6, II: 'In the case of\none, who only performs the Agnihotra (and no longer the Dar _s_ apur _n_\namasa), the evening and morning Agnihotra-oblation (at the time of the \xc3\x82graya\n_n_ a) is performed with new (corn).' 12, 'Or with the milk of (a cow) which\nhas been fed with such (new corn).' The Ka _n_ va text has: 'Now at the\nAgnihotra also some offer (milk obtained from new corn), but let him not do\nso; for he would raise a quarrel were he to offer (such milk).'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 4.
