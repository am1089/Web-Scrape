If it be said that from (Brahman) becoming an enjoyer, there follows non-\ndistinction (of Brahman and the individual soul); we reply--it may be as in\nordinary life.\n\nThe Sa _n_ khya here comes forward with a new objection. You maintain, he\nsays, that the highest Brahman has the character either of a cause or an\neffect according as it has for its body sentient and non-sentient beings in\neither their subtle or gross state; and that this explains the difference in\nnature between the individual soul and Brahman. But such difference is not\npossible, since Brahman, if embodied, at once becomes an enjoying subject\n(just like the individual soul). For if, possessing a body, the Lord\nnecessarily experiences all pain and pleasure due to embodiedness, no less\nthan the individual soul does.--But we have, under I, 2, 8, refuted the view\nof the Lord's being liable to experiences of pleasure and pain!--By no means!\nThere you have shown only that the Lord's abiding within the heart of a\ncreature so as to constitute the object of its devotion does not imply\nfruition on his part of pleasure and pain. Now, however, you maintain that the\nLord is embodied just like an individual soul, and the unavoidable inference\nfrom this is that, like that soul, he undergoes pleasurable and painful\nexperiences. For we observe that embodied souls, although not capable of\nparticipating in the changing states of the body such as childhood, old age,\n&c., yet experience pleasures and pains caused by the normal or abnormal\ncondition of the matter constituting the body. In agreement with this\nScripture says, 'As long as he possesses a body there is for him no escape\nfrom pleasure and pain; but when he\n\np. 428\n\nis free of the body then neither pleasure nor pain touches him' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 12, 1). As thus, the theory of an embodied Brahman constituting the\nuniversal cause does not allow of a distinction in nature between the Lord and\nthe individual soul; and as, further, the theory of a mere Brahman (i.e. an\nabsolutely homogeneous Brahman) leads to the conclusion that Brahman is the\nabode of all the imperfections attaching to the world, in the same way as a\nlump of clay or gold participates in the imperfections of the thing fashioned\nout of it; we maintain that the theory of the Pradhana being the general cause\nis the more valid one.\n\nTo this objection the Sutra replies in the words, 'it may be, as in ordinary\nlife.' The desired distinction in nature between the Lord and the individual\nsoul may exist all the same. That a soul experiences pleasures and pains\ncaused by the various states of the body is not due to the fact of its being\njoined to a body, but to its karman in the form of good and evil deeds. The\nscriptural text also which you quote refers to that body only which is\noriginated by karman; for other texts ('He is onefold, he is threefold'; 'If\nhe desires the world of the Fathers'; 'He moves about there eating, playing,\nrejoicing'; _Kh_. Up. VII, 26, 2; VIII, 2, 1; 12, 3) show that the person who\nhas freed himself from the bondage of karman and become manifest in his true\nnature is not touched by a shadow of evil while all the same he has a body.\nThe highest Self, which is essentially free from all evil, thus has the entire\nworld in its gross and its subtle form for its body; but being in no way\nconnected with karman it is all the less connected with evil of any kind.--'As\nin ordinary life.' We observe in ordinary life that while those who either\nobserve or transgress the ordinances of a ruler experience pleasure or pain\naccording as the ruler shows them favour or restrains them, it does not follow\nfrom the mere fact of the ruler's having a body that he himself also\nexperiences the pleasure and pain due to the observance or transgression of\nhis commands. The author of the Drami _d_ a-bhashya gives expression to\n\np. 429\n\nthe same view, 'As in ordinary life a prince, although staying in a very\nunpleasant place infested with mosquitoes and full of discomforts of all kind\nis yet not touched by all these troubles, his body being constantly refreshed\nby fans and other means of comfort, rules the countries for which he cares and\ncontinues to enjoy all possible pleasures, such as fragrant odours and the\nlike; so the Lord of creation, to whom his power serves as an ever-moving fan\nas it were, is not touched by the evils of that creation, but rules the world\nof Brahman and the other worlds for which he cares, and continues to enjoy all\npossible delights.' That the nature of Brahman should undergo changes like a\nlump of clay or gold we do not admit, since many texts declare Brahman to be\nfree from all change and imperfection.--Others give a different explanation of\nthis Sutra. According to them it refutes the purvapaksha that on the view of\nBrahman being the general cause the distinction of enjoying subjects and\nobjects of enjoyment cannot be accounted for--proving the possibility of such\ndistinction by means of the analogous instance of the sea and its waves and\nflakes of foam. But this interpretation is inappropriate, since for those who\nhold that creation proceeds from Brahman connected with some power or\nNescience or a limiting adjunct (upadhi) no such prima facie view can arise.\nFor on their theory the enjoying subject is that which is conditioned by the\npower or Nescience or upadhi inhering in the causal substance, and the power\nor Nescience or upadhi is the object of enjoyment; and as the two are of\ndifferent nature, they cannot pass over into each other. The view of Brahman\nitself undergoing an essential change (on which that prima facie view might\npossibly be held to arise) is not admitted by those philosophers; for Sutra\nII, 1, 35 teaches that the individual souls and their deeds form a stream\nwhich has no beginning (so that the distinction of enjoying subjects and\nobjects of enjoyment is eternal). But even if it be held that Brahman itself\nundergoes a change, the doubt as to the non-distinction of subjects and\nobjects of enjoyment does not arise; for the distinction\n\np. 430\n\nof the two groups will, on that view, be analogous to that of jars and\nplatters which are modifications of the one substance clay, or to that of\nbracelets and crowns fashioned out of the one substance gold. And on the view\nof Brahman itself undergoing a change there arises a further difficulty, viz.\nin so far as Brahman (which is nothing but pure non-conditioned intelligence)\nis held to transform itself into (limited) enjoying souls and (non-sentient)\nobjects of enjoyment.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 15.
