The impurity of a Brahma _n_ a caused by the birth or death of Sapindas\nlasts ten days.\n\n2\\. In the case of a Kshatriya (it lasts) twelve days.\n\n3\\. In the case of a Vai _s_ ya (it lasts) fifteen days.\n\n4\\. In the case of a _S_ udra (it lasts) a month.\n\n5\\. The relationship of Sapi _nd_ a ceases with the seventh man (in descent or\nascent).\n\n6\\. During the period of impurity oblations (to the Visvedevas), gifts and\nreceiving of alms, and study have to be interrupted.\n\n[XXII. 1-4. M. V, 83; Y. III, 18, 22; \xc3\x82past. I, 5, 16, 18; Gaut.

He who eats but once the food of Brahma _n_ as or others, while they are\nimpure, will remain impure as long as they.\n\n9\\. When the (period of) impurity is over, he must perform a penance (as\nfollows):\n\n10\\. If a twice-born man has eaten (the food) of a member of his own caste,\nwhile the latter was impure, he must approach a river and plunge into it,\nmutter the (hymn of) Aghamarsha _n_ a[1] three times, and, after having\nemerged from the water, must mutter the Gaya _tr_ i[2] one thousand and eight\ntimes.\n\n11\\. If a Brahma _n_ a has eaten the food of a Kshatriya, while the latter was\nimpure, he is purified by performing the same penance and by fasting (on the\nprevious day).\n\n12\\. (The same penance is ordained for) a Kshatriya who has eaten the food of\na Vai _s_ ya, while the latter was impure.\n\n13\\. (The same penance is ordained for) a Brahma _n_ a (who has eaten the\nfood) of an impure Vai _s_ ya; but he must fast besides during the three\n(previous) days.\n\n14\\. If a Kshatriya or a Vai _s_ ya (have eaten the food) of a Brahma _n_ a or\na Kshatriya respectively, who were impure, they must approach a river and\nmutter the Gayatri five hundred times.\n\n15\\. A Vai _s_ ya, who has eaten the food of a Brahma _n_ a, while the latter\nwas impure, must (go to a river and) mutter the Gayatri one hundred and eight\ntimes.\n\n[10. 1 Rig-veda X, 190.-- 2 Rig-veda III, 62, 10.]\n\np. 89\n\n16\\. A twice-born man (who has eaten the food), of a _S_ udra, while the\nlatter was impure must (go to a river and) perform the Pra _g_ apatya\n(penance).\n\n17\\. A _S_ udra (who has eaten the food) of an impure man of a twice-born\ncaste must bathe (in a river).\n\n18\\. A _S_ udra (who has eaten the food) of another _S_ udra, while the latter\nwas impure, must bathe (in a river) and drink Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ agavya.\n\n19\\. Wives and slaves in the direct order of the castes (i. e. who do not\nbelong to a higher caste than their lord) remain impure as long as their lord.\n\n20\\. If their lord is dead (or if they live apart from him, they remain\nimpure) as long as (members of) their own caste.\n\n21\\. If Sapi _nd_ as of a higher caste (are born or have died) the period of\nimpurity has for their lower caste relations the same duration as for members\nof the higher caste.\n\n22\\. A Brahma _n_ a (to whom) Sapi _nd_ as of the Kshatriya, Vai _s_ ya, or\n_S_ udra castes (have been born or have died) becomes pure within six nights,\nor three nights, or one night, respectively.\n\n23\\. A Kshatriya (to whom Sapi _nd_ as of the) Vai _s_ ya or _S_ udra castes\n(have been born or have died) is purified within six and three nights,\nrespectively.\n\n24\\. A Vai _s_ ya (to whom Sapi _nd_ as of the) _S_ udra caste (have been born\nor have died) becomes pure within six nights.\n\n[16. Regarding the Pra _g_ apatya penance, see below, XLVI, 10.\n\n18\\. The Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ agavya, or fire productions of a cow, consists of milk, sour\nmilk, butter, urine, and cow-dung.]\n\np. 90\n\n25\\. In a number of nights equal to the number of months after conception, a\nwoman is purified from an abortion.\n\n26\\. The relatives of children that have died immediately after birth (before\nthe cutting of the navel-string), and of still-born children, are purified at\nonce.\n\n27\\. (The relatives) of a child that has died before having teethed (are also\npurified) at once.\n\n28\\. For him no ceremony with fire is performed, nor offering of water.\n\n29 . For a child that has teethed but has not yet been shorn, purity is\nobtained in one day and night;\n\n30\\. For a child that has been shorn but not initiated, in three nights;\n\n31\\. From that time forward (i. e. for initiated persons) in the time that has\nbeen mentioned above (in Sutra 1 seq.)\n\n32\\. In regard to women, the marriage ceremony is (considered as their)\ninitiation.\n\n33\\. For married women there is no impurity for the relatives on the father's\nside.\n\n34\\. If they happen to stay at their father's house during childbirth or if\nthey die there, (their distant relatives are purified) in one night, and their\nparents (in three nights).\n\n35\\. If, while the impurity, caused by a birth lasts,\n\n[26. 'The meaning is, that the relatives of such children do not become\nimpure.' (Nand.)\n\n28\\. 'The meaning is, that he must not be burnt.', (Nand.)\n\n32\\. The import of this Sutra is this, that the full period of impurity is\nordained on the death of women also, in case they were married, as the\nmarriage ceremony takes with them the place of the initiation of males.]\n\np. 91\n\nanother impurity caused by childbirth intervenes, it ends when the former\nimpurity terminates.\n\n36\\. If it intervenes when one night (only of the period of impurity remains,\nthe fresh impurity terminates) two days later.\n\n37\\. If it intervenes when one watch (only of the last night remains, the\nimpurity ends) three days later.\n\n38\\. The same rule is observed if a relative dies during a period of impurity\ncaused by the death (of another relative).\n\n39\\. If a man, while staying in another country, hears of the birth or death\n(of a relative), he becomes purified after the lapse of the period still\nwanting (to the ten days).\n\n40\\. if the period of impurity, but not a whole year, has elapsed, (he is\npurified in one night.)\n\n41\\. After that time (he is purified) by a bath.\n\n42\\. If his teacher or maternal grandfather has died, (he is purified) in\nthree nights.\n\n43\\. Likewise, if sons other than a son of the body have been born or have\ndied, and if wives who had another husband before have been delivered of a\nchild or have died.\n\n[40. 'Although the general term impurity is used in this Sudra, it refers to\nimpurity caused by a death only.' (Nand.)\n\n42\\. 'The use of the particle _k_ a implies, that this rule extends to the\ndeath of a maternal grandmother, as ordained in the Sha _d_ a _s_ itism _ri_\nti.' (Nand.)\n\n43\\. The twelve kinds of sons have been enumerated above, XV, 2-27. Of these,\nthe three species of adopted sons, the son bought, and the son cast off cannot\ncause impurity, because their sonship dates from a period subsequent to their\nbirth; but their offspring may cause impurity. (Nand.) Parapurvas, or 'wives\nwho had another husband before,' are either of the punarbhu or of the svairi\n_n_ i kind. (Nand.) See XV, 8, 9, and Narada XII, 46-54.]\n\np. 92\n\n44\\. (He becomes pure) in one day, if the wife or son of his teacher, or his\nUpadhyaya (sub-teacher[1]), or his maternal uncle, or his father-in-law, or a\nbrother-in-law, or a fellow-student, or a pupil has died.\n\n45\\. The impurity has the same duration (as in the cases last mentioned), if\nthe king of that country in which he lives has died.\n\n46\\. Likewise, if a man not his Sapi _nd_ a has died at his house.\n\n47\\. The relatives of those who have been killed by (falling from) a\nprecipice, or by fire, or (have killed themselves by) fasting, or (have been\nkilled by) water, in battle, by lightning, or by the king (on account of a\ncrime committed by them), do not become impure;\n\n48\\. Nor do kings (become impure) while engaged in the discharge of their\nditties (such as the protection of their subjects, the trial of lawsuits, &c.)\n\n49\\. Devotees fulfilling a vow (also do not become impure);\n\n50\\. Nor do sacrificers engaged in a sacrificial ceremony;\n\n51\\. Nor workmen (such as carpenters or others) while engaged in their work;\n\n52\\. Nor those who perform the king's orders, if the king wishes them to be\npure.\n\n53\\. Nor (can impurity arise) during the installation of the monument of a\ndeity, nor during\n\n[44. 'See XXIX, 2.\n\n49\\. The term vratin, 'a devotee fulfilling a vow,' may be referred to\nstudents as well, who, however, become impure by the death of their parents.\n(Nand.)\n\n53\\. A marriage ceremony is said to have actually begun when the Nandimukha,\nor _S_ raddha preliminary to marriage, has taken place. (Nand.)]\n\np. 93\n\na marriage ceremony, if those ceremonies have actually begun;\n\n54\\. Nor when the whole country is afflicted with a calamity;\n\n55\\. Nor in times if great public distress (such as an epidemic or a famine).\n\n56\\. Suicides and outcasts do not cause impurity or receive offerings of\nwater.\n\n57\\. On the death-day of an outcast a female slave of his must upset a pot\nwith water with her feet, (saying, 'Drink thou this.')\n\n58\\. He who cuts the rope by which (a suicide) has hung himself, becomes pure\nby performing the Taptak _rikkh_ ra ('hot penance').\n\n59\\. So does he who has been (in any way) concerned with the funeral of a\nsuicide;\n\n60\\. And he who sheds tears for such.\n\n61\\. He who sheds tears for any deceased person together with the relations of\nthe latter (becomes pure) by a bath.\n\n62\\. If he has done so, before the bones (of the deceased) had been collected,\n(he becomes pure) by bathing with his apparel.\n\n63\\. If a member of a twice-born caste has followed the corpse of a dead _S_\nudra, he must go to a river, and having plunged into it, mutter the\nAghamarshana three times, and then, after having emerged from it, mutter the\nGayatri one thousand and eight times.\n\n64\\. (If he has followed) the corpse of a dead member of a twice-born caste,\n(the same expiation\n\n[56. Giving or taking alms does not effect impurity in such cases. (Nand.)]\n\n{p.94}\n\nis ordained, but he must mutter the Gayatri) one hundred and eight times only.\n\n65\\. If a _S_ udra has followed the corpse of a member of a twice-born caste,\nhe must bathe.\n\n66\\. Members of any caste, who have come near to the smoke of a funeral pile,\nmust bathe.\n\n67\\. (Bathing is also ordained) after sexual intercourse, bad dreams (of\nhaving been mounted upon an ass, or the like), when blood has issued from the\nthroat, and after having vomited or been purged;\n\n68\\. Also, after tonsure of the head;\n\n69\\. And after having touched one who has touched a corpse (a carrier of a\ncorpse), or a woman in her courses, or a _K_ a _nd_ ala (or other low-caste\npersons, such as _S_ vapa _k_ as), or a sacrificial post;\n\n70\\. And (after having touched) the corpse of a five-toed animal, except of\nthose kinds that may be eaten[1], or their bones still moist with fat.\n\n71\\. In all such ablutions he must not wear his (defiled) apparel without\nhaving washed it before.\n\n72\\. A woman in her courses becomes pure after four days by bathing.\n\n73\\. A woman in her courses having touched another woman in her courses, who\nbelongs to a lower caste than she does, must not eat again till she is\npurified.\n\n74\\. If she has (unawares) touched a woman of her own caste, or of a higher\ncaste than her own, she becomes pure at once, after having taken a bath.\n\n75\\. Having sneezed, having slept, having eaten,\n\n[70. 1 See LI, 6.\n\n75\\. Nand. argues from a passage of Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1avalkya (I, 196) and from texts of\n\xc3\x82pastamba (not found in his Dharma-sutra) and of Pra _k_ etas, that the\nparticle _k_ a refers to repeated sipping of water.]\n\np. 95\n\ngoing to eat or to study, having drunk (water), having bathed, having spat,\nhaving put on his garment, having walked on the high road, having discharged\nurine or voided excrements, and having touched the bones no longer moist with\nfat of a five-toed animal, he must sip water;\n\n76\\. Likewise, if he has talked to a _K_ andala or to a Mle _kkh_ a\n(barbarian).\n\n77\\. If the lower part of his body, below the navel, or one of his fore-arms,\nhas been defiled by one of the impure excretions of the body, or by one of the\nspirituous liquors or of the intoxicating drinks (hereafter mentioned), he is\npurified by cleansing the limb in question with earth and water.\n\n78\\. If another part of his body (above the navel) has been defiled, (he\nbecomes pure by cleansing it) with earth and water, and by bathing.\n\n79\\. If his mouth has been defiled (he becomes pure) by fasting, bathing, and\ndrinking Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ agavya;\n\n80\\. Likewise, if his lip has been defiled.\n\n81\\. Adeps, semen, blood, dandruff, urine, faeces, earwax, nail-parings,\nphlegm, tears, rheum, and sweat, are the twelve impure excretions of the body.\n\n82\\. Distilled from sugar, or from the blossoms of the Madhuka. (Madhvi\nwine[1]), or from flour: these three kinds of spirituous liquor have to be\ndiscerned; as one, so are all: none of them must be tasted by the twice-born.\n\n83\\. Again, distilled from the blossoms of the\n\n[76. Regarding the meaning of Mle _kkh_ a, see LXXXIV, 4.\n\n82, 83. 1 How the Mahvi, Madhuka, and Madhvika wines differ from one another,\ndoes not become clear. Nand. explains the term Madhuka as denoting an extract\nfrom Madhuka blossoms (bassia latifolia), and Madhvi and Madhvika as two\ndifferent preparations from Madhu. Now Madhu might be rendered by 'honey;'\n{footnote p. 96} but Kulluka, in his comment on the term Madhvi (M. XI, 95),\nstates expressly that it means 'Madhuka blossom,' and Harita (as quoted by\nNand.) says that Madhuka, Madhvi and Madhvika are a preparations from Madhu,\ni.e. Madhuka blossoms. Maireya, according to the lexicographer Va _k_ aspati,\nas quoted by Nand., is an intoxicating drink prepared from the flowers of the\ngrislea tormentosa, mixed with sugar, grain, and water, or, according to the\nreading of the _S_ abdakalpadruma (see the Petersburg Dictionary) with\nsorrel.]\n\np. 96\n\nMadhuka tree (Madhuka wine), from molasses, from the fruits of the _T_ a _n_\nka (or Kapittha tree), of the jujube tree, of the Khar _g_ ura tree, or of the\nbreadfruit tree, from wine-grapes, from Madhuka blossoms (Madhvika wine),\nMaireya, and the sap of the cocoanut tree:\n\n84\\. These ten intoxicating drinks are unclean for a Brahma _n_ a; but a\nKshatriya and a Vai _s_ ya commit no wrong in touching (or drinking) them.\n\n85\\. A pupil having performed (on failure of other mourners) the funeral of\nhis dead Guru, becomes pure after ten nights, like those (kinsmen) who carry\nout the dead.\n\n86\\. A student does not infringe the rules of his order by carrying out, when\ndead, his teacher, or his sub-teacher, or his father, or his mother, or his\nGuru.\n\n87\\. A student must not offer a libation of water to a deceased relative\n(excepting his parents) till the term of his studentship has expired; but if,\nafter its expiration, he offers a libation of water, he becomes pure after\nthree nights.\n\n88\\. Sacred knowledge (see 92), religious austerities (see go), fire (see\nXXIII, 33), holy food (Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ agavya), earth (see 91), the mind, water (see\n91), smearing (with cow-dung and the like, see XXIII, 56), air (see XXIII, 40,\n(the morning and evening prayers and other) religious acts, the sun\n\np. 97\n\n(see XXIII, 40), and time (by the lapse of the ten days of impurity and the\nlike) are purifiers of animate objects.\n\n89\\. Of all pure things, pure food is pronounced the most excellent; for he\nwho eats pure food only, is truly pure, not he who is only purified with earth\nand water.\n\n90\\. By forgiveness of injuries the learned are purified; by liberality, those\nwho have done forbidden acts; by muttering of prayers, those who have sinned\nin secret; by religious austerities, those who best know the Veda.\n\n91\\. By water and earth is purified what should be purified (because it has\nbeen defiled); a river is purified by its current (carrying away all slime and\nmud); a woman, whose thoughts have been impure, by her menses,; and the chief\namong the twice-born (the Brahma _n_ as), by renouncing the world.\n\n92\\. Bodies (when defiled) are purified by water; the mind is purified (from\nevil thoughts) by truth; the soul (is purified or freed from worldly vanity)\nby sacred learning and austerities; the understanding (when unable to resolve\nsome doubt), by knowledge.\n\n93\\. Thus the directions for purifying animate bodies have been declared to\nthee; hear now the rules for cleaning all sorts of inanimate objects.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXIII.](sbe07025.htm)\n\n"
