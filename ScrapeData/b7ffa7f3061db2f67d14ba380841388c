And from the subsequent (Brahma _n_ a) it follows that being of that kind\n(i.e. injunction of a mere vidya) (is the aim) of the text. The connexion (of\nthe fanciful agnis with the real one) is due to the plurality (of details of\nthe real agni which are imaginatively connected with the vidya).\n\nWith regard to a subsequent Brahma _n_ a also, viz. the one beginning, 'That\npiled agni is this world indeed,' we apprehend that what is the purpose of the\ntext is 'being of that kind,' i.e. injunction of a mere vidya, not injunction\nof the member of a mere action. For we meet there with the following _s_\nloka,' By knowledge they ascend there where all wishes are attained. Those\nskilled in works do not go there, nor those who destitute of knowledge do\npenance.' This verse blames mere works and praises knowledge. A former Brahma\n_n_ a also, viz. the one beginning, 'What that orb leads' ( _S_ at. Bra. X, 5,\n2, 23), concludes with a statement of the fruit of knowledge ('Immortal\nbecomes he whose Self is death'), and thereby indicates that works are not the\nchief thing.--The text connects the vidya (of the agnis built of\n\np. 268\n\nmind) with the real agni built of bricks, not because those agnis are members\nof the act of building the real agni, but because many of the elements of the\nreal agni are imaginatively combined with the vidya.\n\nAll this establishes the conclusion that the fire-altars built of mind and so\non constitute a mere vidya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 53](sbe38196.htm)\n\n"
