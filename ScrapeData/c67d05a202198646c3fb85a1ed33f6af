Now, once on a time, the gods were sitting 3 in a sacrificial\nsession, thinking, 'May we attain excellence; may we be glorious, may we be\neaters of food!' That same food, gained by them, wished to go away from them,\n--and, food being cattle, it was the cattle that wished to go away from them,\nthinking, 'It is to be feared lest they, being exhausted, may hurt us 4: how,\nindeed, will they deal with us?'\n\n4:6:9:22\\. They offered these two oblations in the Garhapatya;\n\np. 447\n\nand--the Garhapatya being a house (g _ri_ ha), and a house being a resting-\nplace--they thereby secured them in the house, and thus that food, gained by\nthem, did not go away from them.\n\n4:6:9:33\\. And in like manner do these _S_ attrins now sit through a\nsacrificial session, thinking, 'May we attain excellence, may we be glorious,\nmay we be eaters of food!' That food, gained by them, wishes to go away from\nthem,--and, food being cattle, it is the cattle that wish to go away from\nthem, thinking, 'It is to be feared lest they, being exhausted, may hurt us:\nhow, indeed, will they deal with us?'\n\n4:6:9:44\\. They offer these two oblations 1 in the Garhapatya; and--the\nGarhapatya being a house, and the house being a resting-place--they thereby\nsecure them in the house, and thus that food, gained by them, does not go away\nfrom them.\n\n4:6:9:55\\. And in like manner that offered food wishes to go away from him,\nthinking, 'It is to be feared lest this one will hurt me: how, indeed, will he\ndeal with me?'\n\n4:6:9:66\\. He first eats a very little from the further (back) end of\nit;--thereby he encourages it: it knows, 'It was not so as I thought: he has\nin no wise hurt me.' Thus it becomes attached to him, and, indeed, whosoever,\nknowing this, is able to observe the vow thereof, he becomes an eater of food,\ndear to food.\n\n4:6:9:77\\. This, then, is done at the Sattrotthana (rising from the session)\non the tenth day 2. Each of them\n\np. 448\n\nsits speechless, strengthening his voice 1: with that (voice) strengthened and\nreinvigorated they perform the last day. Then the others are dismissed, either\n(for) fetching fuel or to their day's reading of the scriptures. Now also they\ntake food.\n\n4:6:9:88\\. In the afternoon, having come together and touched water, they\nenter the ladies' hall 2, and while the others hold on to him from behind, he\n3\n\np. 449\n\noffers (on the _S_ aladvarya fire) those two oblations; (the first) with (Va\n_g_. S. VIII, 51), 'Here is joy: here rejoice ye! here is stability, here is\n(your) own stability,--Hail!' He thereby addresses the cattle; they thereby\nsecure cattle for themselves.\n\n4:6:9:99\\. And the second he offers with, 'Letting the sucking calf to the\nmother,'--he means to say by this, 'letting the fire go to the earth;'--'a\nsucking calf drinking from the mother,'--he thereby means the fire sucking the\n(moisture of the) earth;--'may he maintain increase of wealth among us,--\nHail!' increase of wealth is cattle: they thus secure cattle for themselves.\n\n4:6:9:1010\\. They go out eastward, and enter the (shed of the) Havirdhana\ncarts from behind towards the front; for from the front towards the back (they\nenter) when about to perform the sacrifice, but thus (it is done) at the\nrising from the session.\n\n4:6:9:1111\\. On the hinder shaft of the northern cart 1 they sing the Saman\n(Vag . S. VIII, 52), called 'the completion of the session,'--there it is that\nthey reach completeness; or on the northern hip of the high altar; but the\nother is the more usual,\n\n4:6:9:1212\\. That is, on the hinder shaft of the northern cart. 'We have gone\nto the light, we have become immortal,'--for they who sit through a\nsacrificial session become indeed the light, they\n\np. 450\n\nbecome immortal;--'to the sky have we ascended from the earth,'--for they who\nsit through a sacrificial session indeed ascend from the earth to the\nsky;--'we have attained to the gods,'--for they indeed attain to the\ngods;--'to heaven, to the light!' thrice they repeat the finale; for they\nindeed become (partakers of) heaven and bliss. Thus, whatever the nature of\nhis Saman is, that they come to be who sit through a sacrificial session.\n\n4:6:9:1313\\. They creep 1 along right under the axle of the southern cart:\neven as a snake frees itself from its skin, so do they free themselves from\nall evil. They creep along with an ati _kh_ andas verse; for that, the ati\n_kh_ andas (redundant metre), is all the metres;--thus evil does not overtake\nthem: therefore they creep along with an ati _kh_ andas verse.\n\n4:6:9:1414\\. They creep along with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 53; Rig-veda I, 132, 6),\n'O Indra and Parvata, leaders in battle, smite ye every one that wars against\nus, smite him with the thunderbolt! him that is hidden may it please in the\nfar retreat which he hath reached: our foes, O hero, on all sides may the\ntearer tear to pieces,--on all sides!'\n\n4:6:9:1515\\. They go out eastward, and enter the Sadas from the front towards\nthe back; for from the back towards the front (they do so) when about to\nperform the sacrifice; but thus (they do) at the rising from the session.\n\n4:6:9:1616\\. They sit down by their several dhish _n_ ya-hearths. Now, once on\na time, the pith of Va _k_ (speech) wished to desert the gods who had won it;\nit tried to creep away along this earth, for Va _k_ is\n\np. 451\n\nthis earth: her pith are these plants and trees. By means of this Saman 1 they\novertook it, and, thus overtaken, it returned to them. Hence upwards on this\nearth grow the plants, and upwards the trees. And in like manner does the pith\nof Va _k_ wish to desert these (sacrificers) who have won it, and tries to\ncreep away along this earth,--for Va _k_ is this earth: her pith are these\nplants and trees. By means of this Saman they overtake it, and, thus\novertaken, it returns to them. Hence upwards on this earth grow the plants,\nand upwards the trees.\n\n4:6:9:1717\\. They chant verses of the queen of serpents; for the queen of\nserpents is this earth: through her they thus obtain everything. The prelude\nis performed by (the Udgat _ri_ ) himself 2, and the chant is not joined in\n(by the choristers 3), lest some one else overhear it. For he would cause (the\nperformance) to be in excess were another to chant; he would cause an excess,\nwere another to join in it; he would cause an excess, were another to overhear\nit: therefore the prelude is performed by (the Udgat _ri_ ) himself, and the\nchant is not joined in.\n\np. 452\n\n4:6:9:1818\\. The Hot _ri_ recites the Four-Hot _ri_ formulas, whereby he\nfollows up that chant by a _S_ astra 1. If the Hot _ri_ does not know them,\nlet the G _ri_ hapati recite them; but it is the Hot _ri_ 's recitation 2.\n\n4:6:9:1919\\. Then the Adhvaryu's response 3 is, 'These sacrificers have\nprospered: happiness hath accrued unto them!' whereby he bespeaks success to\nhuman speech.\n\n4:6:9:2020\\. Thereupon they utter the Brahmodya 4 in\n\np. 453\n\n[paragraph continues] (the form of a) dialogue. For everything, indeed, is\nobtained, everything gained by them that sit through a sacrificial session,--\nthey have performed with Ya _g_ us prayers: these have obtained so much, have\nacquired so much; they have recited _Ri_ k verses: these have obtained so\nmuch, have acquired so much; they have chanted Samans: these have obtained so\nmuch, have acquired so much. But this has not been obtained, this has not been\nacquired by them, namely, the (theological) discussion, the sacred discourse:\nthis is what they thereby obtain, what they acquire.\n\n4:6:9:2121\\. Having 'crept' up to the Udumbara post, they restrain their\nspeech. Now, they who perform the sacrifice with speech, milk and suck out the\n\np. 454\n\nsacrifice; for sacrifice is speech. And previously to this, each of them sits\nspeechless, strengthening his speech 1, and with their speech thus\nstrengthened and reinvigorated they perform the last day. But at this\n(disputation) the entire speech, thus obtained, becomes exhausted: that speech\nthey all strengthen (by remaining) speechless, and with it thus strengthened\nand reinvigorated they perform the Atiratra 2.\n\n4:6:9:2222\\. They sit touching the Udumbara post 3, for strength is food, and\nthe Udumbara tree is strength: with strength he thus invigorates speech.\n\n4:6:9:2323\\. When the sun has set, they go out (of the Sadas) eastward, and\nsit down behind the \xc3\x82havaniya, in front of the Havirdhana shed. Round them,\nsitting speechless, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ carries the Vasativari water 4. For\nwhatever object they perform the session, therewith let them release their\nspeech. For in olden times the _Ri_ shis were wont to hold sacrificial\nsessions for certain objects,--'such is our wish: may that be fulfilled!' And\nif they be desirous of different objects, desirous of subjects, desirous of\noffspring, desirous of cattle,--\n\np. 455\n\n4:6:9:2424\\. Let them release their speech with this (Va _g_. S. VIII, 53),\n'Earth! Air! Sky!' Thus they render their speech auspicious by means of the\ntruth, and with that auspicious (speech) they pray for blessings,--'May we be\nabundantly supplied with offspring!'--thereby they pray for offspring;--'May\nwe be abundantly supplied with men!'--thereby they pray for men;--'May we be\nabundantly supplied with food!' thereby they pray for prosperity.\n\n4:6:9:2525\\. Thereupon the G _ri_ hapati, or whomsoever the G _ri_ hapati may\ncall upon, recites the Subrahma _n_ ya litany 1. Some, indeed, recite the\nSubrahma _n_ ya each separately; but rather let the G _ri_ hapati, or\nwhomsoever the G _ri_ hapati may call upon, recite the Subrahma _n_ ya. Having\ndesired an invitation to that (Atiratra feast), they put kindling-sticks on\nthe fire 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[446:1](sbe2677.htm#fr_1036) Viz. the Sadas, see [p.\n128](sbe2621.htm#page_128), note [1](sbe2621.htm#fn_346).\n\n[446:2](sbe2677.htm#fr_1037) As in the case of the Pra _k_ ina-va _m_ _s_ a of\nordinary ish _t_ is. See [III, 1, 1,\n6](sbe2603.htm#3:1:1:6)-[7](sbe2603.htm#3:1:1:7).\n\n[446:3](sbe2678.htm#fr_1038) The Ka _n_ va text has nishedu _h_ , 'they sat\ndown.' See [IV, 6, 8, 1](sbe2677.htm#4:6:8:1).\n\n[446:4](sbe2678.htm#fr_1039) See [p. 31](sbe2607.htm#page_31), note\n[1](sbe2607.htm#fn_86).\n\n[447:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1040) Viz. those referred to in paragraphs\n[8](sbe2678.htm#4:6:9:8) and [9](sbe2678.htm#4:6:9:9).\n\n[447:2](sbe2678.htm#fr_1041) That is, on the tenth day of the Da _s_ aratra,\nand hence either the last but one day of the sessional Dvada _s_ aha ([p.\n402](sbe2662.htm#page_402), note [2](sbe2663.htm#fn_935)), or the last day but\ntwo of the Gavam ayana ([p. 426](sbe2670.htm#page_426), note\n[3](sbe2671.htm#fn_988)), called p. 448 Avivakya. The ceremonies here\ndescribed take place in the afternoon, after the regular performance of that\nday's (atyagnish _t_ oma) Soma-sacrifice.\n\n[448:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1042) 'Each of them (? or, one by one), speech-bound,\nguards Soma till the wakening,' Katy. XII, 4, 1. According to the Ka _n_ va\ntext only one (eko haisham) does so (but perhaps at a time), while the others\ndisperse (vitish _th_ ante).\n\n[448:2](sbe2678.htm#fr_1043) The Patni _s_ ala seems to be identical here with\nthe Pra _k_ inava _m_ _s_ a (see Katy. XII, 4, 7), unless it be some shed or\ntent adjoining the latter, cf. \xc3\x82past. _S_ r. X, 5, comm. The sacrificial\nformula of the first offering seems to refer to the domestic hearth, the\ncentre of the family life, as a source of joy and strength to the householder.\n\n[448:3](sbe2678.htm#fr_1044) According to the Ka _n_ va text, the Adhvaryu\nmakes the oblations; but if he does not know how to perform them (i.e. if they\nare not recognised by his school as belonging to the Adhvaryu's duties), the G\n_ri_ hapati does so; and if he cannot do so, any one that knows them, may\nperform them. Regarding these oblations, and the order of the subsequent\nceremonies, there is indeed considerable difference of opinion among the\nritualistic authorities. According to \xc3\x82 _s_ v. VIII, 13, 1-2 all of them\noffer, but only the first oblation is to be performed on the Garhapatya, and\nthe second on the \xc3\x82gnidhriya. La _t_ y. III, 7, 8 seq., on the other hand,\nenjoins the Udgat _ri_ to perform two oblations on the Garhapatya; the first\nwith the (somewhat modified) formula, assigned in our text to the second\noblation, while the second oblation is to be made with 'Svaha' simply. [The\nfirst of the above formulas is, according to that authority, to be used by\nthem, when they touch the Udumbara post, see [IV, 6, 9,\n22](sbe2678.htm#4:6:9:22).] The oblations completed, they are to proceed to\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya, where the Udgat _ri_ s are to chant thrice the Saman II, 1126\n(?); after which they enter the Sadas to perform the Manasa-stotra.\n\n[449:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1045) According to Katy. XII, 4, 10 and comm., the\nsouthern shaft of the northern cart is intended. Similarly the Ka _n_ va text,\n--while touching the right shaft of the northern cart he sings thereon the\nSaman 'the completion (success) of the session.' The words 'sattrasya _ri_\nddhi _h_ ' are doubtless the name of the Saman, which has been erroneously\nmade, with 'asi' appended to it in the Madhy. text of the Sa _m_ hita, the\nbeginning of the Saman.\n\n[450:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1046) See [p. 299](sbe2648.htm#page_299), note\n[2](sbe2648.htm#fn_719).\n\n[451:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1047) Viz. the so-called Manasa-stotra (mental chant),\nSama-veda II, 726-8 (Rig-veda X, 289, 1-3, ascribed to the queen of serpents):\n'The spotted bull has come up, &c.,' performed inaudibly. In connection with\nthis Stotra, an imaginary libation to Pra _g_ apati-Vayu is performed,\neverything connected with which, from the upakara _n_ a (or introduction, on\nthe part of the Adhvaryu, see [p. 401](sbe2662.htm#page_401), note\n[1](sbe2662.htm#fn_931)) up to the bhaksha, or drinking of the cup by the\npriests, is done 'mentally' (that is, as would seem, by gestures merely).\nAccording to. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. II, 13, 6, however, the Hot _ri_ recites the same hymn\nin a low voice (upa _m_ _s_ u), but not inaudibly, as a _S_ astra. But see p.\n452, note 1.\n\n[451:2](sbe2678.htm#fr_1048) Not by the Prastot _ri_ , as is otherwise the\ncase; see [p. 310](sbe2649.htm#page_310), note [1](sbe2649.htm#fn_747).\n\n[451:3](sbe2678.htm#fr_1049) See [p. 311](sbe2649.htm#page_311), note\n[1](sbe2649.htm#fn_748).\n\n[452:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1050) According to this (and Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. IV, 9,\n13) it would seem that the Hot _ri_ is not to recite the hymn of the Manasa-\nstotra, as prescribed by the Ait. Br. and \xc3\x82 _s_ v.\n\n[452:2](sbe2678.htm#fr_1051) The _k_ aturhot _ri_ formulas--so-called from\nfour priests, Agnidh, Adhvaryu, Hot _ri_ ; and Upavakt _ri_ ; being mentioned\nin them--are as follows: 'Their offering-spoon was (the power of) thinking;\nthe ghee was thought; the altar was speech; the barhis was object of\nmeditation; the fire was intelligence; the Agnidh was understanding; the\noblation was breath; the Adhvaryu was the Saman; the Hot _ri_ was Va _k_\naspati; the Upavakt _ri_ was the mind;'--at the end of each of these ten\nformulas the Adhvaryu, according to \xc3\x82 _s_ v., responds, 'Yea (om), Hotar! So\n(it is), O Hotar!'--(the Hot _ri_ proceeds), 'They forsooth took that (manasa)\ngraha; O Va _k_ aspati! O disposer (or decree), O name! Let us praise thy\nname! Praise thou (and) by our name go to heaven! What success the gods have\nobtained with Pra _g_ apati as their g _ri_ hapati, that success shall we\nobtain!'\n\n[452:3](sbe2678.htm#fr_1052) ? That is, at the conclusion of the _k_ aturhot\n_ri_ -mantras. \xc3\x82 _s_ v., on the other hand, makes the Hot _ri_ conclude the\nBrahmodya with the benediction, 'O Adhvaryu, we have succeeded!' to which the\nlatter is to respond, 'We have succeeded, O Hotar!'\n\n[452:4](sbe2678.htm#fr_1053) That is, a discussion, or disputation, regarding\nthe nature of the Brahman. According to Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. IV, 9, 14, as\ninterpreted by the commentary, the performance consists rather in (or is\nfollowed by?) vituperative remarks on Pra _g_ apati, whom they have now safely\ngot into their power (allusion being made, for instance, to his criminal\nrelations to his daughter; to his having created thieves, gad-flies and\nmosquitos, &c.); but this, it seems to me, is probably a wrong interpretation\nof the 'parivadanti' in the text, which may mean that 'they discourse' upon\nPra _g_ apati. So also Katy. XII, 4, 21, p. 453 Pra _g_ apater agu _n_\nakhyanam, 'agu _n_ a' may have to be taken in the sense of 'nirgu _n_ a' or\n'nirgu _n_ atvam' (unqualifiedness, unconditionedness), rather than in that of\n'vice;' and it is worthy of note that the Pra _g_ apati-tanu formulas,\npreceding the Brahmodya proper, consist chiefly in the enumeration of negative\nqualities. 'The twelve bodies of Pra _g_ apati are qualified as follows:--the\neater of food and the mistress of food; the happy and glorious; the abodeless\nand dauntless; the unattained and unattainable; the invincible and\nirresistible; the unpreceded and unmatched.' Then follows the\nBrahmodya:--'Agni is the house-lord (g _ri_ hapati),' so say some: 'he is the\nhouse-lord of this world;'--'Vayu is the house-lord,' so say some: 'he is the\nhouse-lord of the airy region;'--yonder (sun), forsooth, is the house-lord: he\nwho burns yonder, he is the lord, and the seasons are the house. Verily, to\nwhatsoever (sacrificers) he becomes the g _ri_ hapati, who knows that divine g\n_ri_ hapati, that g _ri_ hapati prospers, and they, the sacrificers, prosper:\nto whatsoever (sacrificers) he becomes the g _ri_ hapati, who knows the divine\naverter of evil, that g _ri_ hapati averts evil, and they, the sacrificers,\navert evil! See Ait. Br. V, 25. According to \xc3\x82 _s_ v., the Hot _ri_ alone\nwould seem to repeat the Brahmodya. The expression vakovakya (dialogue)\napparently refers to the controversial form of this discourse. See also A.\nLudwig, Rig-veda, III p. 390 seq.\n\n[454:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1054) The construction of the text is quite irregular,\nand I am by no means certain whether 'tam esham pura' should not be separated\nfrom what follows, and have the verbs 'viduhanti' and 'nirdhayanti' supplied\nafter them,--That (speech) of theirs (they milk and suck out) before this.\nEach now sits speech-bound, strengthening his speech, &c.\n\n[454:2](sbe2678.htm#fr_1055) That is, the last day of the Dvada _s_ aha, or of\nthe Gavamayana, the so-called Udayaniya-atiratra.\n\n[454:3](sbe2678.htm#fr_1056) According to La _t_ y. III, 8, it they form a\ncircle round the Udumbara post and touch it, muttering the mantra, 'Here is\nstability, here is (our) own stability! Here is joy: here rejoice ye!' or, 'In\nme is stability, in me is (your) own stability! in me is joy: in me rejoice\nye!' or both. See p. 448, note 3.\n\n[454:4](sbe2678.htm#fr_1057) See [III, 9, 2, 1](sbe2637.htm#3:9:2:1) seq.\n\n[455:1](sbe2678.htm#fr_1058) See [III, 3, 4, 17](sbe2618.htm#3:4:4:17) seq.\n\n[455:2](sbe2678.htm#fr_1059) According to the comm. on Katy. XII, 4, 28 it is\nthe reciter of the Subrahma _n_ ya who, having said 'O Subrahma _n_ ya, invite\nme thereto!' puts sticks on the fire.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Index to Parts I and II](sbe2679.htm)\n\n"
