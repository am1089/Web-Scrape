'He becomes powerless. Hunger will attack him. He does not gain favour\namong people. His offspring will be perverse.\n\n3\\. 'But he who eats fast-day food, becomes powerful. Hunger will not attack\nhim. He gains\n\np. 29\n\nfavour among people. His offspring will be still more blessed.\n\n4. 4 'Therefore (husband and wife) should eat fast-day food which is pleasant to them.'\n\n5\\. Let them sleep that night on the ground.\n\n6\\. They should spend that night so as to alternate their sleep with waking,\nentertaining themselves with tales or with other discourse.\n\n7. 7 But they should avoid doing anything unholy (such as cohabiting together).\n\n8\\. It is said, that when on a journey, he should not fast.\n\n9\\. For (say they, in that case) the observance has to be kept by his wife.\n\n10\\. Let him do (herein) what he likes.\n\n11\\. In the same way also one who has set up the ( _S_ rauta) fires should\nfast\xc2\x97\n\n12\\. And (he should observe) what is enjoined by the sacred tradition.\n\n13\\. Now in the forenoon, after (the sacrificer) has offered his morning\noblation, and has walked round the fire on its front side, and strewn to the\nsouth of the fire eastward-pointed Darbha grass\xc2\x97\n\n14. 14 (The Brahman) stations himself to the east of that (grass), facing the west, and with the thumb and the fourth finger of his left hand he takes one grass blade from the Brahman's seat and throws it away to the south-west, in the intermediate direction (between south and west), with (the words), 'Away has been thrown the dispeller of wealth.'\n\np. 30\n\n15\\. Having touched water, he then sits down on the Brahman's seat, with (the\nwords), 'I sit down on the seat of wealth.'\n\n16. 16 Facing the fire he sits silently, raising his joined hands, till the end of the ceremony.\n\n17\\. Let him speak (only) what refers to the due performance of the sacrifice.\n\n18\\. Let him not speak what is unworthy of the sacrifice.\n\n19\\. If he has spoken what is unworthy of the sacrifice, let him murmur a\nverse, or a Ya _g_ us, sacred to Vish _n_ u.\n\n20\\. Or let him only say, 'Adoration to Vish _n_ u!'\n\n21. 21 If one wishes, however, to do himself the work both of the Hot _ri_ and of the Brahman, he should in the same way place on the Brahman's seat a parasol, or an outer garment, or a water-pot, or a\n\np. 31\n\nbolster of Darbha grass, and should return in the same way (in which he has\ngone to the Brahman's seat), and then should perform the other (duties).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[28:1](sbe30009.htm#fr_142) 6, 1. The teacher's name is spelt elsewhere\nManutantavya, which seems to be the more correct spelling. The Khadira-G _ri_\nhya (II, I, 5) has Manadantavya. Dr. Knauer has called attention to several\nother blunders of the MSS., which are unusually frequent just in this passage.\nFor I have no doubt that in spite of the unanimous agreement of the MSS. we\nare to change manushyahutir into manushasyahutir, and I think it very\nprobable, to say the least, that in Sutra 4 kamayetaupavasathikam should be\ncorrected into kamayeyatam aupavasathikam, though here the singular could\npossibly be defended by very faithful believers in the authority of the MSS.\n\n[29:4](sbe30009.htm#fr_143) Or, which is pleasant to him? See the note on \xc2\xa7 1.\n\n[29:7](sbe30009.htm#fr_144) Khadira-G _ri_ hya II, I, 7.\n\n[29:14](sbe30009.htm#fr_145) The ceremonies stated in this Sutra have to be\nperformed by the Brahman. This is stated in the commentary, and the comparison\np. 30 of parallel texts leaves no doubt as to the correctness of this view.\nThus Hira _n_ yake _s_ in says (I, 1): etasmin kale brahma ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ opavita\n_m_ k _ri_ tvapa a _k_ amyapare _n_ agni _m_ dakshi _n_ atikramya\nbrahmasadanat t _ri_ _n_ a _m_ nirasya, &c. Comp. also the corresponding\npassages of the _S_ rauta ritual given by Hillebrandt, Neu- and\nVollmondsopfer, p. 17. I do not think it probable, however, that we should\nread brahma\xe0\xa4\xbdsanat, so that it would be distinctly expressed by the text that\nthe Brahman is the subject (comp. Dr. Knauer's Introduction, p. viii). For we\nread in this same Sutra brahmasanat t _ri_ _n_ am abhisa _m_ g _ri_ hya; in\nSutra 15, brahmasana upavi _s_ ati; in Sutra 21, brahmasane nidhaya: of these\npassages it is in the second made probable by the sense, and it is certain in\nthe third, that brahmasana is to be understood as a compound equal to\nbrahmasadana. Thus it would, in my opinion, be unnatural not to explain it in\nthe same way also in the first passage. Paravasu is opposed to Vasu (Sutra 15)\nin the same way as some texts, for instance \xc3\x82pastamba, oppose Paragvasu to\nArvagvasu.\n\n[30:16](sbe30009.htm#fr_146) seqq Khadira-G _ri_ hya I, 1, 19 seqq.\n\n[30:21](sbe30009.htm#fr_147) 'In the same way' refers to the ceremonies stated\nin Sutras p. 31 13 and 14. On the darbha _k_ a _t_ u or, as some MSS. read,\ndarbhava _t_ u, see Bloomfield's note on the G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha, I, 88.\n89. Knauer gives darbhava _t_ u _m_ without adding any various readings. Comp.\nKhadira-G _ri_ hya I, 1, 23.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 7](sbe30010.htm)\n\n"
