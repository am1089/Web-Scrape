(The passage enjoining balya means that the ascetic is to live) not\nmanifesting himself; on account of the connexion (thus gained for the\npassage).\n\nThe passage, 'Therefore let a Brahma _n_ a after he has done with learning\nwish to stand by a childlike state,' speaks of the childlike state as\nsomething to be undertaken. Now by the 'childlike state' we have to understand\neither the nature or the actions of a child. Childhood in so far as it means a\nperiod of life cannot be brought about at will, and we therefore must take the\n'childlike state' to mean either the behaviour of a child--such as attending\nto the calls of nature without any respect of place, &c.--or inward purity,\ni.e. absence of cunning, arrogance, force of the sensual passions, and so on\n1.--With regard to the\n\np. 326\n\ndoubt thus arising the purvapakshin maintains that by 'childlike being' people\nmore commonly understand behaving, talking, and eating according to one's\nliking, freely attending to the calls of nature and so on, and that therefore\nthe word is to be understood here also in that sense.--But such free conduct\nis improper, because sinfulness and so on would follow from it!--Not so, the\npurvapakshin replies; for the Sa _m_ nyasin possessing knowledge is, through\nexpress scriptural statements, free from all sinfulness thus incurred; just as\nthe sacrificer is declared to be free from the sin he might incur in slaying\nthe sacrificial animal.\n\nTo this we reply that it is not so because the statement of the text may be\nunderstood in a different sense. For as long as another rational\ninterpretation of the word 'balya' is possible we have no right to adopt an\ninterpretation which involves the assumption of another injunction being\nrendered futile. Moreover subordinate matters are enjoined with a view to the\nfurtherance of the principal matter, and what here is the principal matter is\nthe endeavour after knowledge which ascetics have to take upon themselves. Now\nif we accepted the entire conduct of a child as what is enjoined here we could\nin no way show that the endeavour of knowledge is furthered thereby. We\ntherefore understand by 'balya' the special inward state of a child, i.e.\nabsence of strong sensual passions and the like. This the Sutra expresses by\nsaying 'Not manifesting.' The meaning of the clause under discussion thus is:\nLet him be free from guile, pride, and so on, not manifesting himself by a\ndisplay of knowledge, learning, and virtuousness, just as a child whose\nsensual powers have not yet developed themselves does not strive to make a\ndisplay of himself before others. For thus the passage gains a connexion with\nthe entire chapter on the ground of co-operating towards the principal matter.\nIn agreement herewith Sm _ri_ ti-writers have said, 'He whom nobody knows\neither\n\np. 327\n\nas noble or ignoble, as ignorant or learned, as well-conducted or ill-\nconducted, he is a Brahma _n_ a. Quietly devoted to his duty, let the wise man\npass through life unknown; let him step on this earth as if he were blind,\nunconscious, deaf.' Another similar passage is, 'With hidden nature, hidden\nconduct,' and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[325:1](sbe38259.htm#fr_204) I am doubtful as to the true reading in this\nplace. The 'va' of the Calcutta edition (p. 1039, last line) has certainly to\nbe struck p. 326 out. Some good MSS. read:--bala _k_ aritam antargata bhavavi\n_s_ uddhir apraru _dh_ endriyatva _m_ dambhadirahitatva _m_ va.--The\n'antargata' seems to mean the same as the 'antara _h_.' p.1041, II, 1-2.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 51](sbe38260.htm)\n\n"
