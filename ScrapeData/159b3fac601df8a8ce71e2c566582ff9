Its object is to mould the character, unfold the\ndivine nature of the soul, and make it possible to live on the spiritual\nplane, its ideal being the realization of Absolute Truth and the manifestation\nof Divinity in the actions of the daily life.\n\nSpirituality does not depend upon the reading of Scriptures, or upon learned\ninterpretations of Sacred Books, or upon fine theological discussions, but\nupon the realization of unchangeable Truth. In India\n\np. 12\n\na man is called truly spiritual or religious not because he has written some\nbook, not because he possesses the gift of oratory and can preach eloquent\nsermons, but because he expresses divine powers through his words and deeds. A\nthoroughly illiterate man can attain to the highest state of spiritual\nperfection without going to any school or university, and without reading any\nScripture, if he can conquer his animal nature by realizing his true Self and\nits relation to the universal Spirit; or, in other words, if he can attain to\nthe knowledge of that Truth which dwells within him, and which is the same as\nthe Infinite Source of existence, intelligence, and bliss. He who has mastered\nall the Scriptures, philosophies, and sciences, may be regarded by society as\nan intellectual giant; yet he cannot be equal to that unlettered man who,\nhaving realized the eternal Truth, has\n\np. 13\n\nbecome one with it, who sees God everywhere, and who lives on this earth as an\nembodiment of Divinity.\n\nThe writer had the good fortune to be acquainted with such a divine man in\nIndia. His name was Ramakrishna. He never went to any school, neither had he\nread any of the Scriptures, philosophies, or scientific treatises of the\nworld, yet he had reached perfection by realizing God through the practice of\nYoga. Hundreds of men and women came to see him and were spiritually awakened\nand uplifted by the divine powers which this illiterate man possessed. To-day\nhe is revered and worshipped by thousands all over India as is Jesus the\nChrist in Christendom. He could expound with extraordinary clearness the\nsubtlest problems of philosophy or of science, and answer the most intricate\nquestions of\n\np. 14\n\nclever theologians in such a masterly way as to dispel all doubts concerning\nthe matter in hand. How could he do this without reading books? By his\nwonderful insight into the true nature of things, and by that Yoga power which\nmade him directly perceive things which cannot be revealed by the senses. His\nspiritual eyes were open; his sight could penetrate through the thick veil of\nignorance that hangs before the vision of ordinary mortals, and which prevents\nthem from knowing that which exists beyond the range of sense perception.\n\nThese powers begin to manifest in the soul that is awakened to the ultimate\nReality of the universe. It is then that the sixth sense of direct perception\nof higher truths develops and frees it from dependence upon the sense powers.\nThis sixth sense or spiritual eye is latent in each\n\np. 15\n\nindividual, but it opens in a few only among millions, and they are known as\nYogis. With the vast majority it is in a rudimentary state, covered by a thick\nveil. When, however, through the practice of Yoga it unfolds in a man, he\nbecomes conscious of the higher invisible realms and of everything that exists\non the soul plane. Whatever he says harmonizes with the sayings and writings\nof all the great Seers of Truth of every age and clime. He does not study\nbooks; he has no need to do so, for he knows all that the human intellect can\nconceive. He can grasp the purport of a book without reading its text; he also\nunderstands how much the human mind can express through words, and he is\nfamiliar with that which is beyond thoughts and which consequently can never\nbe expressed by words.\n\nBefore arriving at such spiritual illumination\n\np. 16\n\nhe goes through divers stages of mental and spiritual evolution, and in\nconsequence knows all that can be experienced by a human intellect. He does\nnot, however, care to remain confined within the limit of sense perception,\nand is not contented with the intellectual apprehension of relative reality,\nbut his sole aim is to enter into the realm of the Absolute, which is the\nbeginning and end of phenomenal objects and of relative knowledge. Thus\nstriving for the realization of the highest, he does not fail to collect all\nrelative knowledge pertaining to the world of phenomena that comes in his way,\nas he marches on toward his destination, the unfoldment of his true Self.\n\nOur true Self is all-knowing by its nature. It is the source of infinite\nknowledge within us. Being bound by the limitations of time, space, and\ncausation, we\n\np. 17\n\ncannot express all the powers that we possess in reality. The higher we rise\nabove these limiting conditions, the more we can manifest the divine qualities\nof omniscience and omnipotence. If, on the contrary, we keep our minds fixed\nupon phenomena and devote the whole of our energy to acquiring knowledge\ndependent entirely upon sense perceptions, shall we ever reach the end of\nphenomenal knowledge, shall we ever be able to know the real nature of the\nthings of this universe? No; because the senses cannot lead us beyond the\nsuperficial appearance of sense objects. In order to go deeper in the realm of\nthe invisible we invent instruments, and with their help we are able to\npenetrate a little further; but these instruments, again, have their limit.\nAfter using one kind of instrument, we become dissatisfied with the results\nand search for some other which may\n\np. 18\n\nreveal more and more, and thus we struggle on, discovering at each step how\npoor and helpless are the sense powers in the path of the knowledge of the\nAbsolute. At last we are driven to the conclusion that any instrument, no\nmatter how fine, can never help us to realize that which is beyond the reach\nof sense-perception, intellect, and thought.\n\nSo, even if we could spend the whole of our time and energy in studying\nphenomena, we shall never arrive at any satisfactory result or be able to see\nthings as they are in reality. The knowledge of to-day, gained by the help of\ncertain instruments, will be the ignorance of tomorrow, if we get better\ninstruments. The knowledge of last year is already the ignorance of the\npresent year; the knowledge of this century will be ignorance in the light of\nthe discoveries of a new century.\n\np. 19\n\nThe span of one human life is, therefore, too short to even attempt to acquire\na correct knowledge of all things existing on the phenomenal plane. The life-\ntime of hundreds of thousands of generations, nay, of all humanity, seems too\nshort, when we consider the infinite variety to be found in the universe, and\nthe countless number of objects that will have to be known before we can reach\nthe end of knowledge. If a man could live a million years, keeping his senses\nin perfect order during that long period, and could spend every moment in\nstudying nature and in diligently endeavoring to learn every minute detail of\nphenomenal objects, would his search after knowledge be fulfilled at the\nexpiration of that time? Certainly not; he would want still more time, a finer\npower of perception, a keener intellect, a subtler understanding; and then he\nmight say, as did\n\np. 20\n\n[paragraph continues] Sir Isaac Newton after a life of tireless research, "I\nhave collected only pebbles on the shore of the ocean of knowledge." If a\ngenius like Newton could not even reach the edge of the water of that ocean,\nhow can we expect to cross the vast expanse from shore to shore in a few brief\nyears? Thousands of generations have passed away, thousands will pass, yet\nmust the knowledge regarding the phenomena of the universe remain imperfect.\nVeil after veil may be removed, but veil after veil will remain behind. This\nwas understood by the Yogis and Seers of Truth in India, who said:\n"Innumerable are the branches of knowledge, but short is our time and many are\nthe obstacles in the way; therefore wise men should first struggle to know\nthat which is highest."\n\nHere the question arises: Which is the highest knowledge? This question is as\n\np. 21\n\nold as history; it has puzzled the minds of the philosophers, scientists, and\nscholars of all ages and all countries. Some have found an answer to it,\nothers have not. The same question was voiced in ancient times by Socrates,\nwhen he went to the Delphic oracle and asked: "Of all knowledge which is the\nhighest?" To which came the answer, "Know thyself."\n\nWe read in one of the Upanishads that a great thinker, after studying all the\nphilosophies and sciences known at that time, came to a Seer of Truth and\nsaid: "Sir, I am tired of this lower knowledge that can be gained from books\nor through the study of the world of phenomena; it no longer satisfies me, for\nscience cannot reveal the ultimate Truth; I wish to know that which is the\nhighest. Is there anything by knowing which I can know the reality of the\nuniverse?"\n\np. 22\n\nThe sage replied: "Yes, there is; and that knowledge is the highest, by\nknowing which you can know the true nature of everything in the universe." And\nhe continued, "Know thyself. If thou canst learn the true nature of thine own\nself, thou wilt know the reality of the universe. In thy true Self thou wilt\nfind the Eternal Truth, the Infinite Source of all phenomena. By knowing this\nthou wilt know God and His whole creation." As by knowing the chemical\nproperties of one drop of water, we know the properties of all water wherever\nit appears, so by knowing who and what we are in reality, we shall realize the\nfinal Truth. Man is the epitome of the universe. That which exists in the\nmacrocosm is to be found in the microcosm. Therefore the knowledge of one\'s\ntrue Self is the highest of all knowledge. Our real Self is divine and one\nwith\n\np. 23\n\n[paragraph continues] God. This may seem to us at present a mere theory, but\nthe nearer we approach the ultimate Truth, the more clearly shall we\nunderstand that it is not a theory but a fact, that now we are dreaming in the\nsleep of ignorance and fancying ourselves this or that particular person. But\nas all experience gained in dreams afterwards appears of little consequence;\nso, waking up from this sleep, we shall find that the knowledge of phenomenal\nnature, upon which we place so much value at present, is of little importance.\nWe shall then realize that all research in the various branches of science\ndepends upon Self-knowledge, and that Self-knowledge is the foundation upon\nwhich the structure of phenomenal knowledge is built.\n\nKnowledge of the Self or \xc3\x82tman is therefore the highest of all. It is the\nideal of the Science of Yoga, and should be the\n\np. 24\n\naim of our life. We should hold it as our first duty to acquire this Self-\nknowledge before we try to know anything concerning the objects of sense-\nperception. How can we gain it? Not from books, not through the study of\nexternal phenomena, but by studying our own nature, and by practicing the\ndifferent branches of Yoga.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: What is Yoga?](hby04.htm)\n\n'
