And they formed a dark scheme to kill the sons of Pandu.\n\nThe sons of Pandu were induced with their mother to pay a visit to a distant\ntown called Varanavata. A house had been built there for their residence,\nconstructed of inflammable materials. At the appointed time fire was set to\nthe house; but the five brothers and their mother escaped the conflagration\nthrough a subterranean passage, retired into forests, and lived in the\ndisguise of Brahmans.\n\nIn course of time they heard of the approaching celebrations of the marriage\nof the princess of Panchala, an ancient kingdom in the vicinity of modern\nKanouj. All the monarchs of Northern India were invited, and the bride would\nchoose her husband from among the assembled kings according to the ancient\n_Swayamvara_ custom. The five sons of Pandu decided to go and witness the\nceremony.\n\nThe portion translated in this Book formed Sections clxxxiv. to cxxxix. of\nBook i. of the original text.\n\n## I\n\n## JOURNEY TO PANCHALA\n\nNow the righteous sons of Pandu, wand\'ring far from day to day,  \nUnto South Panchala\'s country glad and joyful held their way,\n\nFor when travelling with their mother, so it chanced by will of fate.  \nThey were met by pious Brahmans bound for South Panchala\'s State,\n\nAnd the pure and holy Brahmans hailed the youth of noble fame,  \nAsked, them whither they would journey, from what distant land, they came,\n\n"From the land of Ekachakra," good Yudhishthir answered so,  \n"With our ancient mother travelling unto distant lands we go."\n\n"Heard ye not," the Brahmans questioned, "in Panchala\'s fair domain,  \nDrupad, good and gracious monarch, doth a mighty feast, ordain,\n\nTo that festive land we journey, Drupad\'s bounteous gifts to share,  \nAnd to see the swayamvara of Panchala\'s princess fair,--\n\nHuman mother never bore her, human bosom never fed,  \nFrom the Altar sprang the maiden who some noble prince will wed!\n\nSoft her eyes like lotus-petal, sweet her tender jasmine form,  \nAnd a maiden\'s stainless honour doth her gentle soul inform,\n\nAnd her brother, mailed and armed with his bow and arrows dire,  \nRadiant as the blazing altar, sprang from Sacrificial Fire!\n\nFair the sister slender-waisted, dowered with beauty rich and rare,  \nAnd like fragrance of blue lotus, perfumes all the sweetened air,\n\nShe will choose from noble suitors gathered from the west and east,  \nBright and fair shall be the wedding, rich and bounteous be the feast!\n\nKings will come from distant regions sacrificing wealth and gold,  \nStainless monarchs versed in _sastra_ , pious-hearted, mighty-souled,\n\nHandsome youths and noble princes from each near and distant land,  \nCar-borne chieftains bold and skilful, brave of heart and stout of hand!\n\nAnd to win the peerless princess they will scatter presents rare,  \nFood and milch-kine, wealth and jewels, gold and gifts and garments fair,\n\nNoble gifts we take as Brahmans, bless the rite with gladsome heart,  \nShare the feast so rich and bounteous, then with joyful minds depart.\n\nActors, mimes, and tuneful minstrels fair Panchala\'s court will throng,  \nFamed reciters of _puranas_ , dancers skilled and wrestlers strong,\n\nCome with us, the wedding witness, share the banquet rich and rare,  \nPleased with gifts and noble presents to your distant home repair.\n\nDowered ye are with princely beauty, like the radiant gods above,  \nEven on you the partial princess may surrender heart and love,\n\nAnd this youth so tan and stalwart, mighty-armed, strong and bold,  \nHe may win in feats of valour rich renown and wealth untold!\n\n"Be it so," Yudhishthir answered, "to Panchala we repair,  \nView the wedding of the princess and the royal bounty share,"\n\nAnd the righteous sons of Pandu with the Brahmans took their way,  \nWhere in South Panchala\'s kingdom mighty Drupad held his sway.\n\nNow it fell, the saintly _rishi_ , deathless bard of deathless lay,  \nHerald of the holy Vedas, Vyasa stood before their way.\n\nAnd the princes bowed unto him and received his blessings kind,  \nBy his mandate to Panchala went with pleased and joyful mind!\n\nJungle Woods and silver waters round their sylvan pathway lay,  \nHalting at each wayside station marched the princes day by day,\n\nStainless and intent on _sastra_ , fair in speech and pure in heart,  \nTravelling slow they reached Panchala, saw its spacious town and mart,\n\nSaw the fort, bazaar and city, saw the spire and shining dome,  \nIn a potter\'s distant cottage made their humble unknown home,\n\nAnd disguised as pious Brahmans sons of Pandu begged their food,  \nPeople knew not Kuru\'s princes in that dwelling poor and rude.\n\n## II\n\n## THE WEDDING ASSEMBLY\n\nTo the helmed son of Pandu, Arjun pride of Kuru\'s race,  \nDrupad longed to give his daughter peerless in her maiden grace,\n\nAnd of massive wood unbending, Drupad made a stubborn bow,  \nSaving Arjun prince or chieftain might not bend the weapon low,\n\nAnd he made a whirling discus, hung it \'neath the open sky,  \nAnd beyond the whirling discus placed a target far and high,\n\n"Whose strings this bow," said Drupad, "hits the target in his pride  \nThrough the high and circling discus, wins Panchala\'s princely bride!"\n\nAnd they spake the monarch\'s mandate in the kingdoms near and far,  \nAnd from every town and country princes came and chiefs of war,\n\nCame the pure and saintly _rishis_ for to bless the holy rite,  \nCame the Kurus with brave Karna in their pride and matchless might,\n\nBrahmans came from distant regions with their sacred learning blest,  \nDrupad with a royal welcome greeted every honoured guest.\n\nNow the festal day approacheth! Gathering men with ocean\'s voice,  \nFilled the wide and circling stages to behold the maiden\'s choice,\n\nRoyal guests and princely suitors came in pomp of wealth and pride,  \nCar-borne chiefs and mailed warriors came to win the beauteous bride!\n\nNorth-east of the festive city they enclosed a level ground,  \nTowering dome and stately palace cunning builders built around,\n\nAnd by moat and wall surrounded, pierced by gate and arched door,  \nBy a canopy of splendour was the red field covered o\'er!\n\nNow the festal day approacheth! Sacred censers fragrance lent,  \nSprinkled chandan spread its coolness, wreaths were hung of sweetest scent,\n\nAll around were swan-white mansions, lofty domes and turrets high,  \nLike the peaks of white Kailasa cleaving through the azure sky!\n\nSparkling gems the chambers lighted, golden nets the windows laced,  \nSpacious stairs so wide and lofty were with beauteous carpets graced,\n\nRich festoons and graceful garlands gently waved like streamers gay,  \nAnd the swan-like silver mansions glinted in the light of day!\n\nNow the festal day approacheth! High the royal chambers lay,  \nWith their lofty gilded turrets like the peaks of Himalay,\n\nIn these halls in pride and splendour dwelt each rich and royal guest,  \nFired by mutual emulation, and in costly jewels drest,\n\nDecked and perfumed sat these rulers, mighty-armed, rich in fame,  \nLion-monarchs, noble-destined, chiefs of pure and spotless name,\n\nPious to the mighty BRAHMA, and their subjects\' hope and stay,  \nLoved of all for noble actions, kind and virtuous in their sway.\n\nNow the festal day approacheth! like the heaving of the main,  \nSurge the ranks of gathered nations o\'er the wide and spacious plain,\n\nPandu\'s sons in guise of Brahmans mix with Brahmans versed in lore,  \nMark proud Drupad\'sa wealth and splendour, gazing, wondering evermore,\n\nDancers charm the gathered people, singers sing and actors play,  \nFifteen days of festive splendour greet the concourse rich and gay.\n\n## III\n\n## THE BRIDE\n\nSound the drum and voice the _sankha!_ Brightly dawns; the bridal day,  \nFresh from morning s pure ablutions comes the bride in garments gay,\n\nAnd her golden bridal garland, carrying on her graceful arm.  \nSoftly, sweetly, steps Draupadi, queen of every winning charm!\n\nThen a Brahman versed in mantra, ancient priest of lunar race,  \nLights the Fire, with pious offerings seek its blessings and its grace,\n\nWhispered words of benediction saints and holy men repeat,  \nConch and trumpet\'s voice is silent, hushed the lofty war-drum\'s beat.\n\nAnd there reigns a solemn silence, and in stately pomp and pride,  \nDrupad\'s son leads forth his sister, fair Panchala\' s beauteous bride!\n\nIn his loud and lofty accents like the distant thunder\'s sound.  \nDrupad\'s son his father\'s wishes thus proclaims to all around:\n\n_\n\n"Mark this bow, assembled monarchs, and the target hung an high,  \nThrough yon whirling pierced discus let five glist\'ning arrows fly,\n\nWhoso, barn of noble lineage, hits the far suspended aim,  \nLet him stand and as his guerdon Drupad\'s beauteous maiden claim!"\n\n_\n\nThen he turns unto Draupadi, tells each prince and suitor\'s name,  \nTells his race and lofty lineage, and his warlike deeds of fame.\n\n## IV\n\n## THE SUITORS\n\n"Brave Duryodhan and his brothers, princes of the Kuruland,  \nKarna proud and peerless archer, sister! seek thy noble hand,\n\nAnd Gandhara\'s warlike princes, Bhoja\'s monarch true and bold,  \nAnd the son of mighty Drona, all bedecked in gems and gold!\n\nKing and prince from Matsya kingdom grace this noble wedding feast,  \nMonarchs from more distant regions north and south and west and east,\n\nTamralipta and Kalinga on the eastern ocean wave,  \nPattan\'s port whose hardy children western ocean\'s dangers brave!\n\nFrom the distant land of Madra car-borne monarch Salya came,  \nAnd from Dwarka\'s sea-girt regions Valadeva known to fame,\n\nValadeva and his brother Krishna sprung from Yadu\'s race,  \nOf the Vrishni clan descended, soul of truth and righteous grace!\n\nThis is mighty Jayadratha come from Sindhu\'s sounding shore,  \nFamed for warlike feats of valour, famed alike for sacred lore,\n\nThis is fair Kosala\'s monarch whose bright deeds our heralds sing,  \nFrom the sturdy soil of Chedi, this is Chedi\'s peerless king!\n\nThis is mighty Jarasandha, come from far Magadha\'s land,  \nThese are other princely suitors, sister! eager for thy hand,\n\nAll the wide earth\'s warlike rulers seek to shoot the distant aim,  \nPrincess, whoso hits the target, choose as thine that prince of fame!"\n\nDecked with jewels, young and valiant, all aflame with soft desire,  \nConscious of their worth and valour, all the suitors rose in ire,\n\nNobly born, of lofty presence, full of young unyielding pride,  \nLike the tuskers wild and lordly on Himalay\'s wooded side!\n\nEach his rival marks as foeman as in field of deadly strife,  \nEach regards the fair Draupadi as his own his queenly wife,\n\nOn the gorgeous field they gather by a maddening passion fired,  \nAnd they strive as strove the bright gods, when by Uma\'s love inspired!\n\nAnd the gods in cloud-borne chariots came to view the scene so fair,  \nBright ADITYAS in their splendour, MARUTs in the moving air,\n\nWinged _Suparnas_ , scaly _Yagas_ , saints celestial pure and high,  \nFor their music famed, _Gandharvas_ , fair _Apsaras_ of the sky\n\nValadeva armed with ploughshare, Krishna chief of righteous fame.  \nWith the other Yadu chieftains to that wondrous bridal came,\n\nKrishna marked the sons of Pandu eager for the maiden queen,  \nLike wild tuskers for a lotus, like the fire that lurks unseen,\n\nAnd he knew the warlike brothers in their holy Brahman guise,  \nPointed them to Valadeva, gazing with a glad surprise!\n\nBut the other chiefs and monarchs with their eyes upon the bride,  \nMarked nor knew the sons of Pandu sitting speechless by their side,\n\nAnd the long-armed sons of Pandu smitten by KANDARPA\'S dart,  \nLooked on her with longing languor and with love-impassioned heart!\n\nBright Immortals gaily crowding viewed the scene surpassing fair,  \nHeavenly blossoms soft descending with a perfume filled the air,\n\nBright celestial cars in concourse sailed upon the cloudless sky,  \nDrum and flute and harp and tabor sounded deep and sounded high!\n\n## V\n\n## TRIAL OF SKILL\n\nUprose one by one the suitors, marking still the distant aim,  \nMighty monarchs, gallant princes, chiefs of proud and warlike fame,\n\nDecked in golden crown and necklace, and inflamed by pride and love,  \nStoutly strove the eager suitors viewing well the target above,\n\nStrove to string the weapon vainly, tough unbending was the bow,  \nSlightly bent, rebounding quickly, laid the gallant princes low!\n\nStrove the handsome suitors vainly, decked in gem and burnished gold,  \nReft of diadem and necklace, fell each chief and warrior bold,\n\nReft of golden crown and garland, shamed and humbled in their pride,  \nGroaned the suitors in their anguish, sought no more Panchala\'s bride!\n\nUprose Karna, peerless archer, proudest of the archers he,  \nAnd he went and strung the weapon, fixed the arrows gallantly,\n\nStood like SURYA in his splendour and like AGNI in his flame,--  \nPandu\'s sons in terror whispered, Karna sure must hit the aim!\n\nBut in proud and queenly accents Drupad\'s queenly daughter said:  \n"Monarch\'s daughter, born a Kshatra, Suta\'s son I will not wed,"\n\nKarna heard with crimsoned forehead, left the emprise almost done,  \nLeft the bow already circled, silent gazed upon the Sun!\n\nUprose Chedi\'s haughty monarch, mightiest of the monarchs he,  \nOther kings had failed inglorious, Sisupala stood forth free,\n\nFirm in heart and fixed in purpose, bent the tough unbending bow,  \nVainly! for the bow rebounding laid the haughty monarch low!\n\nUprose sturdy Jarasandha, far Magadha\'s mighty chief,  \nHeld the bow and stood undaunted, tall and stately as a cliff,\n\nBut once more the bow rebounded, fell the monarch in his shame,  \nLeft in haste Panchala\'s mansions for the region whence he came!\n\nUprose Salya, king of Madra, with his wondrous skill and might,  \nFaltering, on his knees descending, fell in sad inglorious plight,\n\nThus each monarch fell and faltered, merry whispers went around,  \nAnd the sound of stifled laughter circled round the festive ground!\n\n## VI\n\n## THE DISGUISED ARJUN\n\nHushed the merry sound of laughter, hushed each suitor in his shame,  \nArjun, godlike son of Pritha, from the ranks of Brahmans came,\n\nGuised as priest serene and holy, fair as INDRA\'s rainbow bright,  \nAll the Brahmans shook their deerskins, cheered him in their hearts\' delight!\n\nSome there were with sad misgivings heard the sound of joyous cheer  \nAnd their minds were strangely anxious, whispered murmurs spake their fear:\n\n"Wondrous bow which Sisupala, mighty Salya could not strain,  \nJarasandha famed for prowesq strove to bend the string in vain,\n\nCan a Brahman weak by nature, and in warlike arms untrained,  \nWield the bow which crowned monarchs, long-armed chieftains have not strained?\n\nSure the Brahman boy in folly dares a foolish thoughtless deed,  \nAnd amidst this throng of monarchs shame will be our only meed,\n\nYouth in youthful pride or madness will a foolish emprise dare,  \nSager men should stop his rashness and the Brahman\'s honour spare!"\n\n"Shame he will not bring unto us," other Brahmans made reply,  \n"Rather, in this throng of monarchs, rich renown and honour high,\n\nLike a tusker strong and stately, like Himalay\'s towering crest,  \nStands unmoved the youthful Brahman, ample-shouldered, deep in chest,\n\nLion-like his gait is agile, and determined is his air,  \nTrust me he can do an emprise who hath lofty will to dare!\n\nHe will do the feat of valour, will not bring disgrace and stain,  \nNor is task in all this wide earth which a Brahman tries in vain,\n\nHoly men subsist on wild fruits, in the strength of penance strong,  \nSpare in form, in spirit mightier than the mightiest warlike throng!\n\nAsk not if \'tis right or foolish when a Brahman tries his fate,  \nIf it leads to woe or glory, fatal fall or fortune great,\n\nSon of _rishi_ Jamadagni baffled kings and chieftains high,  \nAnd Agastya stainless _rishi_ drained the boundless ocean dry,\n\nLet this young and daring Brahman undertake the warlike deed,  \nLet him try and by his prowess win the victor\'s noble meed!"\n\nWhile the Brahmans deep revolving hopes and timid fears expressed,  \nBy the bow the youthful Arjun stood unmoved like mountain crest,\n\nSilent round the wondrous weapon thrice the mighty warrior went,  \nTo the God of Gods, ISANA, in a silent prayer he bent,\n\nThen the bow which gathered warriors vainly tried to bend and strain,  \nAnd the monarchs of the wide earth sought to string and wield in vain,\n\nGodlike Arjun born of INDRA, filled with VISHNU\'S matchless might,  \nBent the wondrous bow of Drupad, fixed the shining darts aright,\n\nThrough the disc the shining arrows fly with strange and hissing sound,  \nHit and pierce the distant target, bring it thundering on the ground!\n\nShouts of joy and loud applauses did the mighty feat declare,  \nHeavenly blossoms soft descended, heavenly music thrilled the air,\n\nAnd the Brahmans shook their deerskins, but each irritated chief  \nIn a lowly muttered whisper spake his rising rage and grief,\n\n_\n\nSankha\'s_ note and voice of trumpet Arjun\'s glorious deed prolong,  \nBards and heralds chant his praises in a proud and deathless song!\n\nDrupad in the Brahman\'s mantle knew the hero proud and brave,  \n\'Gainst the rage of baffled suitors sought the gallant prince to save,\n\nWith his twin-born youngest brothers left Yudhishthir, peaceful, good,  \nBhima marked the gathering tempest and by gallant Arjun stood!\n\nLike a queen the beauteous maiden smiled upon the archer brave,  \nFlung on him the bridal garland and the bridal robe she gave,\n\nArjun by his skill and prowess won Panchala\'s princess-bride,  \nPeople\'s shouts and Brahmans\' blessings sounded joyful far and wide!\n\n## VII\n\n## THE TUMULT\n\nSpake the suitors, anger-shaken, like a forest tempest-torn,  \nAs Panchala\'s courteous monarch came to greet a Brahman-born:\n\n"Shall he like the grass of jungle trample us in haughty pride,  \nTo a prating priest and Brahman wed the proud and peerless bride?\n\nTo our hopes like nourished saplings shall he now the fruit deny,  \nMonarch proud who insults monarchs sure a traitor\'s death shall die,\n\nHonour for his rank we know not, have no mercy for his age,  \nPerish foe of crowned monarchs, victim to our righteous rage!\n\nHath he asked us to his palace, favoured us with royal grace,  \nFeasted us with princely bounty, but to compass our disgrace,\n\nIn this concourse of great monarchs, glorious like a heavenly band,  \nDoth he find no likely suitor for his beauteous daughter\'s hand?\n\nAnd this rite of _swayamvara_ , so our sacred laws ordain,  \nIs for warlike Kshatras only, priests that custom shall not stain,\n\nIf this maiden on a Brahman casts her eye, devoid of shame,  \nLet her expiate her folly in a pyre of blazing flame!\n\nLeave the priestling in his folly sinning through a Brahman\'s greed,  \nFor we wage no war with Brahmans and forgive a foolish deed,\n\nMuch we owe to holy Brahmans for our realm and wealth and life,  \nBlood of priest or wise preceptor shall not stain our noble strife,\n\nIn the blood of sinful Drupad we the righteous laws maintain,  \nSuch disgrace in future ages monarchs shall not meet again!"\n\nSpake the suitors, tiger-hearted, iron-handed, bold and strong\'  \nFiercely bent on blood and vengeance blindly rose the maddened throng,\n\nOn they came, the angry monarchs, armed for cruel vengeful strife,  \nDrupad midst the holy Brahmans trembling fled for fear of life,\n\nLike wild elephants of jungle rushed the kings upon their foes,  \nCalm and stately, stalwart Bhima and the gallant Arjun rose!\n\nWith a wilder rage the monarchs viewed these brothers cross their path,  \nRushed upon the daring warriors for to slay them in their wrath,\n\nWeaponless was noble Bhima, but in strength like lightning\'s brand,  \nTore a tree with peerless prowess, shook it as a mighty wand!\n\nAnd the foe-compelling warrior held that mace of living wood,  \nStrong as death with deadly weapon, facing all his foes he stood,\n\nArjun too with godlike valour stood unmoved, his bow in hand,  \nSide by side the dauntless brothers faced the fierce and fiery band!\n\n## VIII\n\n## KRISHNA TO THE RESCUE\n\nKrishna knew the sons of Pandu though in robes of Brahmans dressed,  \nTo his elder, Valadeva, thus his inner thoughts expressed:\n\n"Mark that youth with bow and arrow and with lion\'s lordly gait,  \nHe is helmet-wearing Arjun! greatest warrior midst the great,\n\nMark his mate, with tree uprooted how he meets the suitor band,  \nSave the tiger-waisted Bhima none can claim such strength of hand!\n\nAnd the youth with eyes like lotus, he who left the court erewhile,  \nHe is pious-souled Yudhishthir, man without a sin or guile,\n\nAnd the others by Yudhishthir, Pandu\'s twin-born sons are they,  \nWith these sons the righteous Pritha \'scaped where death and danger lay,\n\nFor the jealous, fierce Duryodhan darkly schemed their death by fire,  \nBut the righteous sons of Pandu \'scaped his unrelenting ire!"\n\nKrishna rose amidst the monarchs, strove the tumult to appease,  \nAnd unto the angry suitors spake in words of righteous peace,\n\nMonarchs bowed to Krishna\'s mandate, left Panchala\'s festive land,  \nArjun took the beauteous princess, gently led her by the hand.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book III: The Imperial Sacrifice](maha03.htm)\n\n'
