If it be said that (Brahman is) not (denoted) on account of the speaker\ndenoting himself; (we reply that this objection is not valid) because there is\nin that (chapter) a multitude of references to the interior Self.\n\nAn objection is raised against the assertion that pra _n_ a denotes Brahman.\nThe word pra _n_ a, it is said, does not denote the highest Brahman, because\nthe speaker designates himself. The speaker, who is a certain powerful god\ncalled Indra, at first says, in order to reveal himself to Pratardana, 'Know\nme only,' and later on, 'I am pra _n_ a, the intelligent Self.' How, it is\nasked, can the pra _n_ a, which this latter passage, expressive of personality\nas it is, represents as the Self of the speaker, be Brahman to which, as we\nknow from Scripture, the attribute of being a speaker cannot be ascribed;\ncompare, for instance, B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 8, 'It is without speech, without\nmind.' Further on, also, the speaker, i.e. Indra, glorifies himself by\nenumerating a number of attributes, all of which depend on personal existence\nand can in no way belong to Brahman, 'I slew the three-headed son of Tvash\n_tri_ ; I delivered the Arunmukhas, the devotees, to the wolves,' and so on.\nIndra may be called pra _n_ a on account of his strength. Scripture says,\n'Strength indeed is pra _n_ a,' and Indra is known as the god of strength; and\nof any deed of strength people say, 'It is Indra's work.' The personal Self of\na deity may, moreover, be called an intelligent Self; for the gods, people\nsay, possess unobstructed knowledge. It thus being a settled matter that some\npassages convey information about the personal Self\n\np. 100\n\nof some deity, the other passages also--as, for instance, the one about what\nis most beneficial for man--must be interpreted as well as they may with\nreference to the same deity. Hence pra _n_ a does not denote Brahman.\n\nThis objection we refute by the remark that in that chapter there are found a\nmultitude of references to the interior Self. For the passage, 'As long as pra\n_n_ a dwells in this body so long surely there is life,' declares that that\npra _n_ a only which is the intelligent interior Self--and not some particular\noutward deity--has power to bestow and to take back life. And where the text\nspeaks of the eminence of the pra _n_ as as founded on the existence of the\npra _n_ a, it shows that that pra _n_ a is meant which has reference to the\nSelf and is the abode of the sense-organs. 1\n\nOf the same tendency is the passage, 'Pra _n_ a, the intelligent Self, alone\nhaving laid hold of this body makes it rise up;' and the passage (which occurs\nin the passus, 'Let no man try to find out what speech is,' &c.), 'For as in a\ncar the circumference of the wheel is set on the spokes and the spokes on the\nnave, thus are these objects set on the subjects (the senses) and the subjects\non the pra _n_ a. And that pra _n_ a indeed is the Self of pra _g \xc3\xb1_a,\nblessed, imperishable, immortal.' So also the following passage which,\nreferring to this interior Self, forming as it were the centre of the\nperipherical interaction of the objects and senses, sums up as follows, 'He is\nmy Self, thus let it be known;' a summing up which is appropriate only if pra\n_n_ a is meant to denote not some outward existence, but the interior Self.\nAnd another scriptural passage declares 'this Self is Brahman, omniscient' 2\n(B _ri_. Up. II, 5, 19). We therefore arrive at\n\np. 101\n\nthe conclusion that, on account of the multitude of references to the interior\nSelf, the chapter contains information regarding Brahman, not regarding the\nSelf of some deity.--How then can the circumstance of the speaker (Indra)\nreferring to himself be explained?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[100:1](sbe34035.htm#fr_133) The text runs, 'astitve _k_ a pra _n_ ana _m_ ni\n_hs_ reyasam,' and Go. \xc3\x82n. explains 'astitve pra _n_ asthitau pra _n_ ana _m_\nindriya _n_ am sthitir ity arthata _h_ _s_ rutim aha.' He as well as \xc3\x82n. Gi.\nquotes as the text of the scriptural passage referred to 'athato ni _hs_\nreyasadanam ity adi.' But if instead of 'astitve _k_ a' we read 'asti tv eva,'\nwe get the concluding clause of Kau. Up. III, 2, as given in Cowell's edition.\n\n[100:2](sbe34035.htm#fr_134) Whence we know that the interior Self referred to\nin the Kau. Up. is Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 30](sbe34036.htm)\n\n"
