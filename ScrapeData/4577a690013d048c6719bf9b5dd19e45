The False and the True 2\n\n"The Self, free from evil, ageless, deathless, sorrowless, hungerless,\nthirstless, real of desire, real of purpose, this should men inquire after,\nyea, should seek to know. All worlds he wins and all desires who traces out\nand understands the Self," said Praj\xc4\x81-pati.\n\nBoth the gods and the demons marked this. "Come," said they, "let us seek out\nthis Self by seeking out which one wins all worlds and all desires." So Indra\nof the gods and Virochana of the demons set out on a travel, and without being\nin compact they both came with faggots\n\np. 92\n\nin their hands 1 to Praj\xc4\x81-pati, and stayed as Brahman-students for two-and-\nthirty years.\n\nThen said Praj\xc4\x81-pati to them, "What would ye, that ye have stayed?"\n\nAnd they said, "The Self, free from evil, ageless, deathless, sorrowless,\nhungerless, thirstless, real of desire, real of purpose, this should men\ninquire after, yea, should seek to know. All worlds he wins and all desires\nwho traces out and understands this Self. This they report to be thy saying,\nsir; in desire thereof have we stayed."\n\nThen Praj\xc4\x81-pati said to them, "The Being 2 who is seen in the eye is the Self"\n--thus he spake--"this is the deathless, the fearless; this is Brahma."\n\n"Then who is he, sir, that is discerned in water and in a mirror?"\n\n"It is he that is discerned in all these beings."\n\n"Look upon yourselves in a basin of water," said he, "and tell me what of\nyourselves you do not perceive."\n\nThey looked in a basin of water; and Praj\xc4\x81-pati said to them, "What see you?"\n\n"We see in this image the whole of our selves, sir," said they, "even to our\nhair and nails."\n\nThen Praj\xc4\x81-pati said to them, "Put on goodly\n\np. 93\n\nornament and fine clothing, attire yourselves, and look in the basin of\nwater."\n\nThey put on goodly ornament and fine clothing, attired themselves, and looked\nin the basin of water. Praj\xc4\x81-pati said to them, "What see you?"\n\nThey said, "Even as we stand here wearing goodly ornament and fine clothing,\nand attired, sir, so are we there wearing goodly ornament and fine clothing,\nand attired, sir."\n\n"This is the Self," said he, "this is the deathless, the fearless; this is\nBrahma."\n\nThe twain travelled away content of heart. Gazing after them, Praj\xc4\x81-pati said:\n"They are travelling away, yet have they not found and traced out the Self.\nThey who shall follow this doctrine, be they the gods or the demons, shall be\nbrought low."\n\nNow Virochana came content of heart to the demons, and declared to them this\ndoctrine: "The Self 1 should be gladdened here, the Self should be tended; he\nthat gladdens the Self here and tends the Self gains both this world and that\nbeyond." Therefore it is that here even now men say of one who is not\nbountiful nor believing nor given to sacrifice, "Fie, a demon!" For this is\nthe doctrine of the demons; and when one has died men furnish his body with\nfood and clothing\n\np. 94\n\nand ornament, imagining that therewith they will win the world beyond.\n\nBut Indra, ere he reached the gods, foresaw this peril: "Even as this [Self] 1\nwears goodly ornament when this body wears goodly ornament, is finely clothed\nwhen it is finely clothed, and is attired when it is attired, so likewise this\n[Self] becomes blind when this [body] is blind, lame when it is lame, maimed\nwhen it is maimed; yea, it perishes with the perishing of this body. I see no\npleasure herein."\n\nHe came back, faggots in hand. Praj\xc4\x81-pati said to him, "Maghav\xc4\x81, as thou didst\ndepart content of heart with Virochana, what wouldst thou, that thou hast come\nback?"\n\nAnd he said: "Even as this [Self], sir, wears goodly ornament when this body\nwears goodly ornament, is finely clothed when it is finely clothed, and is\nattired when it is attired, so likewise this [Self] becomes blind when this\n[body] is blind, lame when it is lame, maimed when it is maimed; yea, it\nperishes with the perishing of this body. I see no pleasure herein."\n\n"Thus indeed it is, Maghav\xc4\x81," said he; "but I will teach thee yet more of it.\nStay another two-and-thirty years."\n\nHe stayed another two-and-thirty years. Then he said to him: "He who wanders\nabout rejoicing\n\np. 95\n\nin dreams, 1 is the Self"--thus he spake "this is the deathless, the fearless;\nthis is Brahma."\n\nHe departed content of heart. But ere he reached the gods, he foresaw this\nperil: "This [Self] indeed becomes not blind though the body be blind, nor\nlame though it be lame, nor is it defiled by the defilement thereof; it is not\nstricken by the smiting thereof, nor is it lamed with the lameness thereof;\nbut nevertheless it is as if it were stricken, as if it were hustled, as if it\nwere feeling unpleasantness, as if it were weeping. I see no pleasure herein."\n\nHe came back, faggots in hand. Praj\xc4\x81-pati said to him, "Maghav\xc4\x81, as thou didst\ndepart content of heart, what wouldst thou, that thou hast come back?"\n\nAnd he said: "This [Self] indeed becomes not blind though the body be blind,\nnor lame though it be lame, nor is it defiled by the defilement thereof; it is\nnot stricken by the smiting thereof, nor is it lamed with the lameness\nthereof; but nevertheless it is as if it were stricken, as if it were hustled,\nas if it were feeling unpleasantness, as if it were weeping. I see no pleasure\nherein."\n\np. 96\n\n"Thus indeed it is, Maghav\xc4\x81," said he; "but I will teach thee yet more of it.\nStay another two-and-thirty years."\n\nHe stayed another two-and-thirty years. Then he said to him: "When one sleeps\nutterly and in perfect peace so that he beholds no dream, 1 this is the Self"\n--thus he spake--"this is the deathless, the fearless; this is Brahma."\n\nHe departed content of heart. But before he reached the gods, he foresaw this\nperil: "Truly one thus 2 knows no longer himself as "I am," nor these\ncreatures. He has sunk into destruction. I see no pleasure herein."\n\nHe came back, faggots in hand. Praj\xc4\x81-pati said to him, "Maghav\xc4\x81, as thou didst\ndepart content of heart, what wouldst thou, that thou hast come back?"\n\nAnd he said: "Truly, sir, one thus knows no longer himself as "I am," nor\nthese creatures. He has sunk into destruction. I see no pleasure herein."\n\n"Thus indeed it is, Maghav\xc4\x81," said he; "but I will teach thee yet more of it;\nit is nowhere but in this. Stay another five years."\n\nHe stayed another five years. These amount to one hundred and one years; so\nmen say, "Verily Maghav\xc4\x81 stayed for one hundred and\n\np. 97\n\none years as Brahman-student with Praj\xc4\x81-pati." Then he said to him: "Verily,\nMaghav\xc4\x81, this body is mortal, held in the grasp of Death; but it is the seat\nof this deathless, bodiless self. 1 The Embodied is held in the grasp of joy\nand sorrow; for what is embodied cannot be quit of joy and sorrow. But joy and\nsorrow touch not what is unembodied. Unembodied is the wind; unembodied are\nthe cloud, the lightning, the thunder. As these, rising up from yonder ether,\npass into the Supreme Light and issue forth each in its own semblance, so\nlikewise this perfect Peace, rising up from this body, passes into the Supreme\nLight and issues forth in its own semblance. This is the Highest Spirit\xe2\x80\xa6Now\nwhen the eye is fixed upon the ether,\n\np. 98\n\nthat is the spirit in the eye [which sees]; the eye is but a means to see.\nWhen one thinks that he will smell a thing, it is the Self; the nostril is but\na means to smell. When one thinks that he will utter a word, it is the Self;\nspeech is but a means to utterance. When one thinks that he will hear a thing,\nit is the Self; the ear is but a means to hearing. When one thinks that he\nwill think of a thing, it is the Self; the mind is his divine eye; with this\ndivine eye he sees these desires and rejoices therein\xe2\x80\xa6All worlds he wins and\nall desires who traces out and understands the Self." Thus spake Praj\xc4\x81-pati.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[91:1](brk41.htm#fr_56) This verse is \xe1\xb9\x9aig-veda, i. 189, I.\n\n[91:2](brk42.htm#fr_57) Chh\xc4\x81ndogya Upanishad, VIII. vii.-xii.\n\n[92:1](brk42.htm#fr_58) See above, p. 85.\n\n[92:2](brk42.htm#fr_59) _Purusha;_ cf. extract i., p. 56. This answer of\nPraj\xc4\x81-pati conveys the _materialistic_ view of the Self, viz. as the visible\nmaterial body, Elsewhere _Purusha_ regularly denotes the _soul._\n\n[93:1](brk42.htm#fr_60) The physical self, i.e. the conception of the material\nbody.\n\n[94:1](brk42.htm#fr_61) The physical self, i.e. the conception of the material\nbody.\n\n[95:1](brk42.htm#fr_62) The _individual_ soul or Self, which in dreams is free\nfrom the physical afflictions of empiric existence, but nevertheless is still\ntormented by the mental concepts of these. This standpoint is that of realism.\n\n[96:1](brk42.htm#fr_63) The standpoint of pure transcendental idealism.\n\n[96:2](brk42.htm#fr_64) In dreamless sleep.\n\n[97:1](brk42.htm#fr_65) Praj\xc4\x81-pati, in answer to Indra\'s criticism of his last\ndefinition of the Self, explains that the utter unconsciousness of dreamless\nsleep is not a state of non-being, but a state of transcendental Being-\nConsciousness. Finite consciousness is active in embodied existence, which is\nattended by sensations of pleasure and pain. But the finite consciousness of\nembodied being is but an illusive phase of the infinite consciousness of\nunembodied existence, which is represented by the state of dreamless sleep.\nThe great forces of cosmic nature are in essence incorporeal; when confined\nwithin the category of space or ether they produce in the macrocosm the\nphenomena of a finite universe; but essentially they transcend space, being\nthe infinite powers of Absolute Being. Similarly in the microcosm the physical\nfunctions which cause the conceptions of individual existence as subject of\nempiric thought are really phases of the Absolute Consciousness, the\nobjectless Subject, essentially transcending individual existence.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XV: Gloria in Excelsis](brk43.htm)\n\n'
