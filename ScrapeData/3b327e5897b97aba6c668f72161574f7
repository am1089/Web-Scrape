This is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Puran\xcc\x81a,\nand is one argument against its antiquity. It is possible, though not yet\nproved, that Krishn\xcc\x81a as an Avatara of Vishn\xcc\x81u, is mentioned in an\nindisputably genuine text of the Vedas. He is conspicuously prominent in the\nMahabharata, but very contradictorily described there. The part that he\nusually performs is that of a mere mortal, although the passages\n\np. lxxi\n\nare numerous that attach divinity to his person. There are, however, no\ndescriptions in the Mahabharata of his juvenile frolics, of his sports in\nVrindavan, his pastimes with the cow-boys, or even his destruction of the\nAsuras sent to kill him. These stories have all a modern complexion: they do\nnot harmonize with the tone of the ancient legends, which is generally grave,\nand sometimes majestic: they are the creations of a puerile taste, and\ngrovelling imagination. These Chapters of the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a offer some\ndifficulties as to their originality: they are the same as those on the same\nsubject in the Brahma Puran\xcc\x81a: they are not very dissimilar to those of the\nBhagavata. The latter has some incidents which the Vishn\xcc\x81u has not, and may\ntherefore be thought to have improved upon the prior narrative of the latter.\nOn the other hand, abridgment is equally a proof of posteriority as\namplification. The simpler style of the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a is however in favour\nof its priority; and the miscellaneous composition of the Brahma Puran\xcc\x81a\nrenders it likely to have borrowed these chapters from the Vishn\xcc\x81u. The life\nof Krishn\xcc\x81a in the Hari-van\xc5\x9ba and the Brahma-vaivartta are indisputably of\nlater date.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Sixth Book](vp030.htm)\n\n'
