The remaining six\nchapters of the last book of the Brahma _n_ a form the so-called Brihad-ara\n_n_ yaka, or great forest-treatise, which, as one of the ten primitive\nUpanishads, is included in Professor F. Max Muller\'s translation of those old\ntheosophic treatises, published in the present series. The portion of the work\ncontained in this volume forms practically continuation of the first five ka\n_n_ _d_ as, the intervening five books being devoted to the consideration of\nthe Agni _k_ ayana, or construction of the sacred brick-altar, which had come\nto be recognised as an important preliminary to the Soma-sacrifice. The\ncircumstances which seem to have led to this somewhat peculiar distribution of\nthe different sections of the work have been explained in the introduction to\nthe first volume of the translation. As was there shown, the inclusion of the\nAgni _k_ ayana in the sacrificial system of the Va _g_ asaneyins, or\ntheologians of the White Ya _g_ us, appears to have resulted in a definite\nsettlement of the sacrificial texts of the ordinary ritual, as contained in\nthe first eighteen adhyayas of the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita, as well as of\nthe dogmatic explanation of that ritual as given in the first nine ka _n_ _d_\nas of the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a. Considerable portions of the remaining\nsections of both works may have been, and very likely were, already in\nexistence at the time of that settlement, but, being excluded from the regular\nceremonial, they were naturally more liable to subsequent modifications and\nadditions than\n\np. xiv\n\nthose earlier sections which remained in constant use. Whilst the tenth ka _n_\n_d_ a, included in the preceding volume of the translation, consisted of\nspeculations on the sacred fire-altar, as representing Purusha-Pra _g_ apati\nand the divine body of the Sacrificer--whence that book is called the\nAgnirahasya, or mystery of the fire-altar--the present volume contains the\nsupplementary sections connected with the sacrificial ceremonial proper.\n\nThe eleventh and twelfth ka _n_ _d_ as are mainly taken up with additional\nremarks and directions on most of the sacrifices treated of in the first four\nka _n_ _d_ as, especially with expiatory ceremonies and oblations in cases of\nmishaps or mistakes occurring during the performance, or with esoteric\nspeculations regarding the significance and mystic effect of certain rites. In\nthis way the eleventh book deals with the New and Full-moon sacrifices; the\nSeasonal offerings ([XI, 5, 2](sbe44026.htm#11:5:2)), the Agnihotra ([XI, 5,\n3](sbe44027.htm#11:5:3); [6, 2](sbe44035.htm#11:6:2)), the Soma-sacrifice\n([XI, 5, 5](sbe44029.htm#11:5:5); [9](sbe44033.htm#11:5:9)), and the Animal-\nsacrifice ([XI, 7, 2](sbe44038.htm#11:7:2)-[8, 4](sbe44044.htm#11:8:4));\nwhilst the twelfth ka _n_ _d_ a treats of the \'Gavam ayanam\'--or most common\nsacrificial session lasting for a year, thus offering a convenient subject for\ndilating upon the nature of Pra _g_ apati, as the Year, or Father Time;--of\nadditional expiatory rites for Soma-sacrifices ([XII,\n6](sbe44064.htm#12:6:1)), and of the Sautrama _n_ i, consisting of oblations\nof milk and spirituous liquor, supposed to obviate or remove the unpleasant\neffects of any excess in the consumption of Soma-juice ([XII,\n7](sbe44065.htm#12:7:1)-[9](sbe44071.htm#12:9:1)). Though supplementary notes\nand speculations on such ceremonial topics cannot but be of a somewhat\ndesultory and heterogeneous character, they nevertheless offer welcome\nopportunities for the introduction of much valuable and interesting matter. It\nis here that we find the famous myth of Pururavas and Urva _s_ i ([XI, 5,\n1](sbe44025.htm#11:5:1)); and that of Bh _ri_ gu, the son of Varu _n_ a,\nvividly illustrating the notions prevalent at the time regarding retribution\nafter death ([XI, 6, 1](sbe44034.htm#11:6:1)) as also the important cosmogonic\nlegend of the golden egg from which Pra _g_ apati is born at the beginning of\nthe evolution of the universe ([XI, 1, 6](sbe44008.htm#11:1:6)). Of\nconsiderable interest also are the chapters treating of the way in which\n\np. xv\n\nthe dead body of the pious performer of the Agnihotra, or daily milk-offering,\nis to be dealt with ([XII, 5,\n1](sbe44062.htm#12:5:1)-[2](sbe44063.htm#12:5:2)); of the initiation and the\nduties of the Brahma _n_ ical student ([XI, 3, 3](sbe44055.htm#12:3:3); 5, 4);\nand, last not least, of the study of the Vedas ([XI, 5,\n6](sbe44030.htm#11:5:6)-[7](sbe44031.htm#11:5:7)) and their subsidiary texts\namongst which we meet, for the first time, with the Atharva\xe1\xb9\x85giras as a special\ncollection of texts recommended for systematic study.\n\nWith the commencement of the thirteenth ka _n_ _d_ a, we enter once more upon\na regular exposition of a series of great sacrifices like those discussed in\nthe early books; the first and most important of them being the A _s_ vamedha,\nor Horse-sacrifice. Like the Ra _g_ asuya, or inauguration of a king, the A\n_s_ vamedha is not a mere sacrifice or series of offerings, but it is rather a\ngreat state function in which the religious and sacrificial element is closely\nand deftly interwoven with a varied programme of secular ceremonies. But\nwhilst the Ra _g_ asuya was a state ceremonial to which any petty ruler might\nfairly think himself entitled, the A _s_ vamedha, on the contrary, involved an\nassertion of power and a display of political authority such as only a monarch\nof undisputed supremacy could have ventured upon without courting humiliation\n1; and its celebration must therefore have been an event of comparatively rare\noccurrence. Perhaps, indeed, it is owing to this exceptional character of the\nA _s_ vamedha rather than to the later origin of its ritual and dogmatic\ntreatment that this ceremony was separated from the Ra _g_ asuya which one\nwould naturally have expected it to succeed. It is worthy of remark, in this\nrespect, that, in Katyayana\'s Anukrama _n_ i to the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_\nhita, the term \'khila,\' or supplement, is not applied to the A _s_ vamedha\nsection 2 (Adhy. XXII-XXV), while the subsequent sections are distinctly\ncharacterised as such. As a matter of fact, however, the A _s_ vamedha has\n\np. xvi\n\nreceived a very unequal treatment in the different rituals. Of the two\nrecensions of the Brahma _n_ a of the _Ri_ g-veda priests, the Aitareya-brahma\n_n_ a takes no account whatever of the Horse-sacrifice, whilst its last two\nbooks (VII, VIII)--generally regarded as a later supplement, though probably\nalready attached to the work in Pa _n_ ini\'s time--are mainly taken up with\nthe discussion of the Ra _g_ asuya. The Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a, on the other\nhand, passes over both ceremonies, their explanation being only supplied by\nthe _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-sutra, along with that of some other sacrifices, in two of\nits chapters (15 and 16), composed in Brahma _n_ a style, and said to be\nextracted from the Maha-Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a 1. In the principal Brahma _n_\na of the Saman priests, the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avi _m_ _s_ a-brahma _n_ a, the A _s_\nvamedha, as a triratra, or triduum, is dealt with in its proper place (XXI,\n4), among the Ahinas, or several days\' performances. As regards the Black Ya\n_g_ us, both the Ka _th_ aka and the Maitraya _n_ i Sa _m_ hita give merely\nthe mantras of the A _s_ vamedha 2, to which they assign pretty much the same\nplace in the ritual as is done in the White Ya _g_ us. In the Taittiriya-sa\n_m_ hita, on the other hand, the mantras are scattered piecemeal over the last\nfour ka _n_ _d_ as; whilst, with the exception of a short introductory vidhi-\npassage, likewise given in the Sa _m_ hita (V, 3, 12), the whole of the\nexegetic matter connected with this ceremony is contained, in a continuous\nform, in the Taittiriya-brahma _n_ a (VIII and IX). Lastly, in the Vaitana-\nsutra of the Atharva-veda--doubtless a comparatively late work, though\nprobably older than the\n\np. xvii\n\n[paragraph continues] Gopatha-brahma _n_ a 1\\--the A _s_ vamedha is treated\nimmediately after the Ra _g_ asuya, and followed by the Purushamedha and\nSarvamedha; these four ceremonies being characterised at the end as the\nKshatriya\'s sacrifices 2 (medha).\n\nWith regard to the earliest phase of Vedic religion, there is no direct\nevidence to show that the horse-sacrifice was already at that time a\nrecognised institution. Two hymns of the _Ri_ g-veda (I, 162; 163), it is\ntrue, relate to that sacrifice 3, but they evidently belong to the latest\nproductions 4 of that collection, though still sufficiently far removed from\nthe time of the oldest of the ritual works just referred to. Seeing, however,\nthat animal sacrifices generally are not alluded to in the _Ri_ ksa _m_ hita\n5, whilst there is every reason to believe that they were commonly practised\nfrom remote antiquity, this absence of earlier positive evidence regarding the\nhorse-sacrifice cannot be taken as proving the later origin of that\ninstitution. As will be seen further on, there are sufficient indications to\nshow that even human sacrifices were at one time practised amongst the Aryans\nof India, as they were amongst their\n\np. xviii\n\n[paragraph continues] European kinsmen. The fundamental idea which underlay\nthis practice doubtless was the notion that man, as the highest attainable\nliving being, could not but be the most acceptable gift that could be offered\nto the gods, and, at the same time, the most appropriate substitute for the\nhuman Sacrificer himself. For the same reason no doubt only domesticated\nanimals were considered suitable for sacrifice; and amongst these the horse\nwas naturally looked upon as ranking next to man ( _S_ at. Br. VI, 2, I, 2),\nalthough considerations of practical expediency and even of social distinction\nmight prevent its use for ordinary sacrificial purposes.\n\nIn the speculations of the Brahma _n_ as, a deep mystic significance is\nattached to the Horse-sacrifice. In the last two chapters of the \'Mystery of\nthe Fire-altar\' ( _S_ at. Br, X, 6, 4, I; 4), the A _s_ vamedha--i.e. the\nsacrificial horse itself--is coupled with the Arka, the mysterious name of the\nsacred fire, as the representative of Agni-Pra _g_ apati, the Sun. The horse-\nsacrifice is called the bull ([XIII, 1, 2, 2](sbe44075.htm#13:1:2:2)), and the\nking ([XIII, 2, 2, 1](sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:1)), of sacrifices, just as the\nhorse itself is the highest and most perfect of animals 1 ([XIII, 3, 3,\n1](sbe44096.htm#13:3:3:1); Taitt. Br. III, 8, 7; 8, 9, 1); the horse selected\nfor sacrifice, in particular, being said to be worth a thousand cows ([XIII,\n4, 2, 1](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:1)). The connection of the sacrificial horse with\n\'the lord of creatures\' is, of course, fully accounted for by the theory of\nthe identity of the sacrifice generally with Purusha-Pra _g_ apati, discussed\nin the introduction to part iv of this translation. The sacrificial horse\naccordingly belongs to Pra _g_ apati, or rather is of Pra _g_ apati\'s nature\n(pra _g_ apatya); nay, as the Taitt. Br. (III, 9, 17, 4) puts it, it is a form\nof Pra _g_ apati himself (pra _g_ apate rupam a _s_ va _h_ ), and is, of all\nanimals, the one most conformable (anurupatama _h_ ) to Pra _g_ apati. Hence\nalso, in the cosmogonic account at the commencement of the Agni _k_ ayana\nsection (VI, 1, 1, 11), the horse is represented as having originated,\nimmediately after the Brahman (sacred lore) and Agni, directly from the\n\np. xix\n\negg produced by Pra _g_ apati from the cosmic waters; whilst, according to\nother accounts (VII, 5, 2, 6; [XIII, 3, 1, 1](sbe44094.htm#13:3:1:1)), the\nhorse originated from Pra _g_ apati\'s eye. But, since the offering also\nrepresents the offerer himself, or rather his divine self awaiting him in the\nother world ([XI, 1, 8, 6](sbe44010.htm#11:1:8:6); [2, 2,\n6](sbe44012.htm#11:2:2:6)), the sacrificial horse is also identified with the\nSacrificer (ya _g_ amano va a _s_ va _h_ , Taitt. Br. III, 9, 17, 4) who\nthereby obtains the fellowship of the Lord of creatures and a place in his\nworld (ib. III, 9, 20, 2).\n\nBesides Pra _g_ apati, there is, however, another deity who lays claim to the\npossession of the sacred steed; for the horse is Varu _n_ a\'s sacrificial\nanimal ( _S_ at. Br. V, 3, 1, 5; VI, 2, I, 5; Taitt. Br. III, 9, 16, 1); nay,\nVaru _n_ a is even the lord of all one-hoofed cattle (Va _g_. S. XIV, 30; _S_\nat. Br. VIII, 4, 3, 13). This connection of the horse with Varu _n_ a seems\nnatural enough, seeing that this god, as the king of heaven and the upholder\nof the law, is the divine representative of the earthly king; whence the Ra\n_g_ asuya, or coronation-ceremony, is called Varu _n_ a\'s consecration ( _S_\nat. Br. V, 4, 3, 21; cf. II, 2, 3, 1). For this reason the barley also is\nsacred to Varu _n_ a 1 ([XIII, 3, 8, 5](sbe44101.htm#13:3:8:5)); and\naccordingly, during the same ceremony, the king offers a barley-mash to Varu\n_n_ a, in the house of his Suta, or charioteer and herald; a horse being the\nsacrificial fee for this offering (V, 3, I, 5). In the Vedic hymns, this\nassociation o1 the god Varu _n_ a with the noble quadruped finds a ready, If\nrather commonplace, explanation in a common natural phenomenon: Varu _n_ a\'s\nhorse is none other than the fiery racer who pursues his diurnal course across\nthe all-encompassing arch of heaven, the sphere of Varu _n_ a 2, the all-\nruler. It is in the\n\np. xx\n\nform of the horse that the Sun is thus lauded in the hymn Rig-v. I, 163,\nrecited by the Hot _ri_ on the second Soma-day of the A _s_ vamedha, after the\nhorse has been led up to the sacrificial stake, and to the slaughtering-place\n1:--1. \'When, first born (just born), thou didst neigh, uprising from the sea,\nor from the vapoury region, the falcon\'s wings and the deer\'s feet--\npraiseworthy greatness was innate in thee, O steed!\' . . . 4. \'Three\nfetterings 2, they say, are thine in the sky, three in the waters, three\nwithin the sea; and like unto Varu _n_ a, O steed, dost thou appear to me,\nwhere, they say, thy highest birth-place is.\' And since, as in these verses,\nthe upper regions commonly present themselves to the eye of the Vedic singer\nunder the semblance of a heavenly sea, Varu _n_ a also comes to be looked upon\nas the divine representative of the waters; whilst the horse, for the same\nreason, is supposed to have sprung from the waters. Of any connection of the\nsacrificial horse with Pra _g_ apati, on the other hand, as of the Pra _g_\napati theory of the sacrifice generally, clearly shadowed forth in the\nPurusha-sukta, and so decidedly dominant during the Brahma _n_ a period, no\ntrace is to be found in the earlier hymns. Indeed, if we have any right to\nassume that the horse-sacrifice was known and practised in the earlier times,\nit can scarcely be doubted that King Varu _n_ a must have been the deity to\nwhom this victim was chiefly consecrated.\n\nThe close and natural relations between the sun and the heavens find their\nhallowed expression in the divine duad Mitra and Varu _n_ a. Though, judged by\nthe number of\n\np. xxi\n\nhymns addressed to them, singly or jointly, this pair of deities occupies a\nsomewhat subordinate position in the Vedic pantheon, there is reason to\nbelieve that it formed a more prominent feature of a phase of belief lying\nbeyond the period reflected in the hymns of the _Ri_ g-veda. Judging from the\npeculiar character of these deities, one might indeed be inclined to claim for\nthe people that formed religious conceptions such as these a long period of\npeaceful dwelling and normal intellectual growth. if such was the case, the\noccupation of the land of the seven rivers and the gradual eastward drift\ncertainly proved a turning-point in the development of this Aryan people. But,\nin any case, the decided change of climate 1, and the close contact with\naboriginal tribes of inferior culture, could hardly fail, along with the\nchanged conditions of life, to influence considerably the character of the\npeople, and to modify their religious notions and intellectual tendencies. As,\nin their struggles against hostile tribes, the people would naturally look to\nleaders of deed and daring rather than to mild and just rulers, so the violent\nwar of elements, periodically convulsing the heavens in these regions, after\nlong and anxious seasons of heat and drought, and striking awe and terror into\nthe minds of men, might seem to them to call for a heavenly champion of a\ndifferent stamp than the even-headed and even-tempered Varu _n_ a,--it would\nneed a divine leader of dauntless, and even ferocious, spirit to fight the\nworshipper\'s battle against his earthly and unearthly foes. Such a champion\nthe Vedic Aryans indeed created for themselves in the person of Indra, the\ndivine representative, as it were, of their warlike kings, and the favourite\nsubject of their song. And side by side with him, and sharing with him the\nhighest honours--nay, even taking precedence of him--we find the divine\npriest, Agni, the deified fire of sacrifice, as representing the all-\npervading, all-supporting\n\np. xxii\n\nlight of heaven; just as we found Mitra, the sun, by the side of Varu _n_ a,\nthe god of the all-encompassing heaven. Not as if Agni and Indra had ever\nentirely superseded Mitra and Varu _n_ a. On the contrary, all these gods\ncontinue to share, in a greater or less degree, the affections of the Vedic\nsingers; and as regards Varu _n_ a and Indra in particular, their relations\nare well expressed by Vasish _th_ a when he says (Rig-v. VII, 82, 2; 5), that\nthe one (Varu _n_ a) is \'samra _g_ \' (universal ruler, overlord); and the\nother (Indra) \'svara _g_ \' (self-ruler, independent lord);--and that, ever\nsince the time when these two, by their power, created all the beings in the\nworld, Mitra serves Varu _n_ a in peace, whilst the mighty (Indra) goes forth\nwith the Maruts in quest of glory. Even in the sacrificial ritual, Mitra and\nVaru _n_ a continue to play an important part, seeing that one of the priests\n--the Maitravaru _n_ a--is named after them, that they receive various\noblations, and that at the end of every Soma-sacrifice at least one sterile\ncow is offered to them, apparently as an expiatory victim, for shortcomings in\nthe sacrifice 1, thus accentuating once more the ethical character of these\ndeities. It is thus not to be wondered at that, whilst Agni and Indra are most\ncommonly referred to in the Brahma _n_ as as the divine representatives of the\nBrahman and Kshatra, or the spiritual and the political powers-the high priest\nand king-respectively, the very same is the case as regards Mitra and Varu _n_\na 2; and the Maruts, representing the common people, are accordingly\nassociated with Varu _n_ a,\n\np. xxiii\n\nas their king or ruler ( _S_ at. Br. II, 5, 2, 34), just as they are with\nIndra (II, 5, 2, 27). One might thus expect that Indra would claim the same\nspecial connection 1 with the sacrificial horse as that which is conceded to\nVaru _n_ a. The reason why this is not the case probably is that, in the\nBrahma _n_ a period, the notion of the horse having, like the sun, originated\nfrom the cosmic waters had become as firmly established as was the traditional\nconnection--nay, even identity 2\\--of Varu _n_ a with the element of water\ngenerally.\n\nAs regards Varu _n_ a\'s and Pra _g_ apati\'s joint connection with the\nsacrificial horse, the Taitt. S. (II, 3, 12, 1) records the following legend\nwhich may perhaps have some bearing on this point:--Pra _g_ apatir Varunaya\n_s_ vam anayat, sa sva _m_ devatam ar _kh_ at, sa pary adiryata, sa eta _m_\nvaru _n_ a _m_ _k_ atushkapalam apa _s_ yat, ta _m_ nir avapat, tato vai sa\nvaru _n_ apa _s_ ad amu _k_ yata, Varu _n_ o va eta _m_ g _ri_ h _n_ ati\nyo\xe0\xa4\xbdsva _m_ pratig _ri_ h _n_ ati, yavato\xe0\xa4\xbd _s_ van pratig _ri_ h _n_ iyat\ntavato varu _n_ a _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ atushkapalan nir vaped, Varu _n_ am eva svena\nbhagadheyenopa dhavati, sa evaina _m_ varu _n_ apa _s_ an mu _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\nati:--\'Pra _g_ apati led up the horse to Varu _n_ a: he (thereby) impaired his\nown godhead, and became racked all over with dropsy. He beheld that four-\nkapala (cake) sacred to Varu _n_ a, and offered it, and thereupon was freed\nfrom Varu _n_ a\'s noose; for Varu _n_ a seizes him who takes (receives) a\nhorse,--as many horses as one takes so many four-kapala (cakes) one ought to\noffer to Varu _n_ a: one (thereby) hastens up to Varu _n_ a with his (V.\'s)\nown share, and he (V.) frees him from Varu _n_ a\'s noose.\'\n\nThe interpretation of this legend presents, however, some difficulties. Dr.\nHillebrandt, Varu _n_ a and Mitra\' (p. 64), translates the first sentence\nby--\'Pra _g_ apati fuhrte dem\n\np. xxiv\n\n[paragraph continues] Varu _n_ a das Ross fort 1\'--\'Pra _g_ apati led the\nhorse away froth Varu _n_ a\': this would undoubtedly make better sense, but,\nunfortunately, the construction of \'ni\' with the dative in this sense would\ninvolve a decided solecism. Saya _n_ a, on the other hand, takes it in the\nsame sense as we have done, and he explains that it is just by giving away the\nhorse whose deity he himself is that Pra _g_ apati forfeits his godhead 2. He\nfeels, however, afterwards constrained to assign to \'pratig _ri_ h _n_ ati\'\nthe causal force of \'he causes it to be taken, he gives it away,\' which is\nclearly impossible. But whatever the correct interpretation of the opening\nclause may be, it seems at all events-clear that the sacrificial horse is\nrepresented in the legend as undergoing a change of ownership from the one\ndeity to the other.\n\nWhen one compares the ceremonial of the A _s_ vamedha, as expounded in the\nBrahma _n_ a, with the ritual indications contained in the two hymns already\nreferred to, one is struck by the very marked contrast between the two. For\nwhilst, on the central day of the A _s_ vamedha alone, the ritual requires the\nimmolation of not less than 349 victims bound to twenty-one stakes ([p.\n311](sbe44087.htm#page_311), n. [1](sbe44087.htm#fn_791))--not counting two\nsets of eleven Savaniya victims ([p. 383](sbe44106.htm#page_383), n.\n[3](sbe44106.htm#fn_999)) subsequently added thereto--the hymns (I, 162, 2-4;\n163, 12) seem only to mention two victims, viz. the horse itself, and a he-\ngoat. This latter animal which is to precede the horse when led to the\nsacrificial ground (and stake), and to\n\np. xxv\n\nbe slaughtered first in order to carry the welcome news of the sacrifice to\nthe gods, is in one place referred to as Pushan\'s share, and in another as\ngoing forward to the dear seat of Indra and Pushan 1. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana ( _S_\nrautas. XVI, 3, 27-30), however, takes these statements of the _Ri_ shi to\nrefer to two different he-goats, both of which he includes amongst the victims\ntied to the horse\'s limbs, viz. one, sacred to Pushan, tied to the forehead,\nand another, sacred to Indra and Pushan, fastened to the navel, of the horse\n2. The corresponding \'parya\xe1\xb9\x85gya\' victims recognised by the Maitraya _n_ i Sa\n_m_ hita (III, 13) and the White Ya _g_ us (Va _g_. S. XXIV, 1), on the other\nhand, are a black-necked he-goat for Agni, tied to the forehead, and a black\nor grey ( _s_ yama) one, bound to the navel, and consecrated by the one\nauthority to Pushan, and by the other to Soma and Pushan. But, curiously\nenough, the Taittiriya school (Taitt. Br. III, 8, 23; \xc3\x82p. _S_ r. XX, 13, 12)\nrecognises not only Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khayana\'s two victims, but also the one for Agni;\nwhilst in regard to the other victims also it differs considerably from the\nother schools of the Ya _g_ ur-veda. Seeing, then, that there is so little\nagreement on these points even amongst different branches of the same Veda,\none can hardly escape the inference that, in this respect at least, there was\nno continuity of ritual practice since the time of those two hymns. As regards\nthe other points therein alluded to, the he-goat and horse are referred to\n\np. xxvi\n\nas being led round thrice in accordance with the sacred ordinance. Now, this\nceremony is quite foreign to the later practice in animal sacrifices. Saya _n_\na accordingly takes it to refer to the rite of \'paryagnikara _n_ a,\' or\ncarrying fire round the victims 1; but the text of the passage evidently does\nnot admit of such an interpretation; and, besides, in _Ri_ g-v. X, 155, 5, the\nsacrificial cow is apparently referred to as first being led round, and then\nfire being carried round it. It is therefore more probable that the victims\nwere in the first place made to circumambulate the fire, or the fire and stake\ncombined.\n\nFurther, the allusion to the pa _s_ u-puro _d_ a _s_ as, or cakes offered in\nconnection with the victims, as well as to the two cloths and the piece of\ngold placed on the ground, as they are in the later practice, for the dead\nhorse to lie upon, might seem to suggest that even then this sacrifice was not\nperformed in quite so simple a manner, but somewhat more in accordance with\nthe later ceremonial than the scanty allusions in the hymns might lead one to\nsuppose. At all events, however, we shall probably not be far wrong in\nassuming that, from the very beginning, the performance of the horse-sacrifice\nmust have had connected with it a certain amount of ceremonial of a purely\nsecular and popular character. Even at the time of the fully developed ritual\nthis was almost certainly the case to a larger extent than would appear from\nthe exposition of it given in the Brahma _n_ as and Sutras which, indeed, are\nmainly concerned with the religious side of the ceremonial. For this reason\nconsiderable interest attaches to the description of the horse-sacrifice given\nin the \xc3\x82 _s_ vamedhika-parvan of the Mahabharata in which much greater stress\nis laid on the popular and chivalrous aspect of this religious observance.\nThough this epic account manifestly emanates from a much later period 2, it\nseems, upon the whole; to present the\n\np. xxvii\n\ntraditional features of this royal ceremony, embellished no doubt by all the\nexercise of that poetic fancy to which the occasion so readily lends itself.\n\nOn the completion of the great war between the Pa _n_ _d_ ava and Kaurava\nprinces, Yudhish _th_ ira, having re-ascended the throne of his fathers,\nresolves on performing the horse-sacrifice, as calculated to cleanse him of\nall guilt 1 incurred by the slaughter of his Kaurava kinsmen. Having been\ninitiated on the day of the _K_ aitra full-moon (beginning of spring), \'the\nking, clad in a linen (? silk) garment and the skin of a black antelope,\nbearing a staff in his hand, and wearing a gold wreath, and a round gold plate\n2 round his neck, shone like a second Pra _g_ apati at the holy cult.\' The\nchosen steed 3, of black and white colour like the black buck, is then led up,\nand is set free by the sage Vya _s_ a himself; and that model of knightly\nperfection, Ar _g_ una, the king\'s second brother, is appointed to guard the\npriceless victim during its year\'s roaming. He accordingly starts after it on\nhis chariot yoked with white steeds, attended by a picked body-guard 4, amidst\nthe rejoicings and fervent blessings of all Hastinapura--men, women, and\nchildren. Thus followed by its martial escort, the noble steed roams at will\nover the lands\n\np. xxviii\n\nover which sovereign sway is claimed by the Pa _n_ _d_ ava king--to wit, the\nwhole of India from sea to sea--first pressing eastwards towards the sea, then\nturning southwards along the eastern shore as far as the extreme point of the\npeninsula, and finally northwards again, on its homeward way, along the\nwestern coast. Time after time the determined attempts to impede its progress,\nor even to capture and retain it as a precious trophy and token of national\nindependence, are successfully repelled by the dauntless son of P _ri_ tha;\nbut, mindful of his brother\'s injunctions, he spares the lives of the kings\nand princes who oppose him, and, having obtained their submission, he invites\nthem to attend the sacrifice of the horse at Hastinapura. On the other hand,\nnot to take up the challenge implied in the progress of the horse was\nconsidered a sign of weakness or cowardice. Thus the king of Ma _n_ ipura is\ncensured severely by Ar _g_ una for receiving him meekly, accompanied only by\nBrahmans and with presents to offer to the intruder, being told that he had\nlamentably fallen away from the status of a Kshatriya, and acted the part of a\nwoman. At length tidings of the approach of the horse reach the king, and\nforthwith preparations are made for getting ready the sacrificial ground, and\nto provide accommodation, on a right royal scale, for the numerous, guests\nexpected to witness the ceremonial. Specimens of all available species of\nanimals are brought together to serve as victims 1 along with the sacred\nhorse; and dialecticians,\n\np. xxix\n\neager to vanquish one another, foregather to discuss the nature and origin of\nthings. At last Ar _g_ una arrives, and, having met with an enthusiastic\nwelcome, he \'takes repose like a seafaring man who has reached the shore after\ncrossing the ocean.\' Then commences the performance of the sacrifice, the\ngeneral outline of which, as sketched in the epic 1, fairly corresponds to the\nordinary ceremonial; the chief points of difference being the form and\nmaterial of the altar, which is described as three-cornered, like the heavenly\nbird Garu _d_ a, and as being composed of a \'trunk,\' measuring eighteen\ncubits, and made, like the wings, of gold bricks,--the structure thus shining\nlike the altar of Daksha Pra _g_ apati. The sacrifice over, a great public\nfestival ensues for which \'mountains of food and sweetmeats, rivers of\nspirituous and other beverages, and lakes of ghee\' are provided, and the\nfeasting goes on through day and night till every one has had his fill,--a\nfestival, indeed, of which the poet remarks people continued to talk to his\nday.\n\nFrom the fanciful narrative of Ar _g_ una\'s martial exploits whilst following\nhis precious charge, one could not of course venture to draw any conclusion as\nto the kind of adventures the sacred horse might have met with, at the time of\nthe Brahma _n_ a, during the period of its roaming at large. As a rule,\nhowever, the closely-watched animal would probably not range very far from the\nplace where the sacrifice was to be performed; and though its body of\nguardians were not permitted at any time to force it to retrace its steps,\nthey could have had little difficulty in keeping it within a certain range of\ngrazing. Indeed, on the occasion of King Da _s_ aratha\'s A _s_ vamedha 2,\ndescribed in the first canto of the Ramaya _n_ a, no mention whatever is made\nof\n\np. xxx\n\nanything having happened to the horse during its time of grace. The expedient\nmentioned in the Brahma _n_ a ([XIII, 4, 2, 5](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:5)) that a\nhundred worn-out horses should be sent along with the horse to keep it company\nwould doubtless, as a rule, prove a sufficient check; but seeing that neither\nthe Taitt. Brahma _n_ a nor _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana alludes to this expedient, it is\nprobably meant as a practical suggestion rather than as a positive injunction.\nThat the horse intended for sacrifice was by no means always safe from violent\nassaults 1 is clear from the directions given in the Brahma _n_ as as to what\nshould be done in the event of foes getting possession of it 2. Even more\npointed, in this respect, are the stanzas quoted in our Brahma _n_ a (XIII, 5,\n4, 21. 22),--\'Satanika Satra _g_ ita seized a sacrificial horse in the\nneighbourhood, the sacrifice of the Ka _s_ is, even as Bharata (seized that)\nof the Satvats. The mighty Satanika having seized, in the neighbourhood, Dh\n_ri_ tarash _t_ ra\'s white sacrificial horse, whilst roaming at will in its\ntenth month 3, the son of Satra _g_ ita performed the Govinata (form of)\nsacrifice.\' As a rule, however, the fortunes of the roaming horse would\ndoubtless depend largely on personal circumstances. Whilst a strong ruler who\nhad already made his power felt amongst his neighbours would probably run\nlittle risk of having his consecrated victim kidnapped even though it were to\nstray beyond its master\'s boundaries, a prince of greater pretensions than\nresources might find it very difficult to secure the safety of his horse even\nif it kept well within the territory over which he ruled. In any case,\nhowever, the capture of the noble beast would doubtless\n\np. xxxi\n\ncause not a little bad blood, and might lead to complications and struggles\nnot less serious than those occasioned by Vasish _th_ a\'s cow, or, in Irish\nlegend, by the brown bull of Queen Medb (Mab) of Connaught.\n\nWhilst the epic account of the A _s_ vamedha thus presents an instructive,\nthough extravagant, illustration of possible occurrences during the\npreliminary period of the sacrifice, some items of the ceremonial on which\nfurther information might have been acceptable are altogether ignored in it.\nTwo of these at least one might have expected to find mentioned there, seeing\nthat they are of special interest to Kshatriyas, viz. the practice of a Brahma\n_n_ a and a Kshatriya lute-player singing 1, morning and night, stanzas\ncomposed by themselves in honour of the king; and the so-called \'revolving\nlegend\' ([XIII, 4, 3, 1](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:1) seqq.) related by the Hot _ri_\n, in a ten days\' cycle all the year round. It is especially in regard to this\nlatter point that the statements of the ritualistic works might with advantage\nhave been supplemented. During the ten days\' cycle a different god, or some\nmythic personage, is assumed, on each successive day, to be king, having some\nspecial class of beings assigned to him as his subjects, and a certain body of\ntexts as his Veda from which a section is then recited. But from the\nparticulars given it even remains uncertain whether any legend connected with\nthe respective deity was actually related; whilst regarding the form and\nnature of some of the specified texts--such as the sarpavidya (snake-science),\ndeva _g_ anavidya (demonology), maya (or asuravidya. magic art)--we really\nknow next to nothing. Nay, even regarding the Itihasas and Pura _n_ as,\nlikewise figuring as distinct texts, additional knowledge would by no means be\nunwelcome. And though regarding some of the divinities referred to the Hot\n_ri_ might easily have made up some kind of short tale, others would have\nrequired some\n\np. xxxii\n\nexercise of ingenuity, unless he had at his disposal materials other than\nthose accessible to us. As a rule, however, legends of this kind would seem to\nhave been of the simplest possible description, as may be gathered from the\nparticulars regarding the \'Nara _s_ a _m_ sani,\' or recitals in praise of\n(pious) men, which, according to _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana (XVI, 11), take the place of\nthe \'revolving legend\' in the ten days\' cycle of the Purushamedha. The Hot\n_ri_ \'s recitals on that occasion consist simply of certain verses, or hymns,\nof the _Ri_ g-veda, generally celebrating the liberality shown by some patron\nto his priest, preceded by a brief statement merely consisting, it would seem,\nof a prose paraphrase of the respective verses recited thereafter. This latter\nset of recitations and legends thus consists entirely of matter taken from, or\nbased on, the _Ri_ g-veda, which is indeed the proper source for the Hot _ri_\npriest to resort to for his utterings. The recitations required for the A _s_\nvamedha, on the other hand, consist of matter drawn not even from the three\nolder Vedas alone, but also from the Atharvans and A\xe1\xb9\x85giras whose names\ncombined usually make up the old designation of the hymns and spells of the\nAtharva-veda, whilst they are here taken separately as if still representing\ntwo different collections of texts;--nay, the materials, as we have seen, are\neven drawn from other, probably still later, sources 1. This circumstance,\nadded to the fact that the texts of the Black Ya _g_ us make no mention of\nthis item of the ceremonial 2, might well make one suspect its comparatively\nlate introduction into the A _s_ vamedha ritual; though even this would not,\nof course, make it any the less strange that no allusion should be made, in\nthe epic account, to this by no means the least interesting feature of the\nperformance. One must, however, bear in mind that the poet\'s mind was\nevidently more intent on telling about the wonderful deeds\n\np. xxxiii\n\nof the semi-divine bowman in foreign lands than on recording the regularly\nrecurring rites performed, in the meantime, at home in the presence of the\nroyal sacrificer himself. Even in cases where the horse was kept within a\nconvenient distance from the sacrificial compound all the year round, its\nwarders, themselves partly of royal blood, could hardly have had an\nopportunity of attending the performance of these rites; though the popular\ncharacter of some of these rites, as well as certain expressions used in\nconnection with the \'revolving legend,\' would lead one to suppose that they\nwere meant to be witnessed by at least representatives of the various classes\nof the population.\n\nThe ritual arrangements of the Purushamedha, or human sacrifice, of which the\nBrahma _n_ a treats next, seem to have been developed out of those of the A\n_s_ vamedha. Its first three Soma-days are essentially the same as the three\ndays of the horse-sacrifice, except as regards the difference of victims on\nthe second day. To these the authorities of the White Ya _g_ ur-veda--and\napparently also those of the Black Ya _g_ us 1\\--add two more days, whilst the\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-sutra 2, on the other hand, recognises but one additional day.\nLike the Vaitana-sutra, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana also differs from the other authorities\nin giving an entirely different character to the central feature of this\nperformance, inasmuch as he makes it a teal human sacrifice instead of a\nmerely symbolic one. A peculiar interest thus attaches to this difference of\ntheory, seeing that it involves the question as to how far down the practice\nof human sacrifices can be traced in India 3. That such sacrifices were\npractised\n\np. xxxiv\n\nin early times is clearly shown by unmistakable traces of them in the\nritualistic works; but in this respect India only shares a once almost\nuniversal custom. The question, then, which chiefly interests us here is\nwhether or not this practice was still kept up at the time with which we are\nhere concerned. Now, as regards the texts of the Ya _g_ ur-veda--that is, the\ntext-books of the sacrificial priest \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xe1\xbe\xbd \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xbe\xce\xbf\xcf\x87\xce\xae\xce\xbd\\--it seems pretty clear that\nthey no longer recognise the sacrifice of human beings; and the same may be\nsaid of the remaining ritualistic literature with the exception of the two\nworks above referred to with regard to this particular sacrifice. The points\nbearing on this question being very few in number, may be briefly reviewed\nhere.\n\nFirst as regards the story of _S_ una _h_ _s_ epa which is recited at the Ra\n_g_ asuya sacrifice 1, and has been several times treated before 2. King Hari\n_s_ _k_ andra, being childless, prays to Varu _n_ a to grant him a son, vowing\nto sacrifice him to the god. A son is born to him, and is called Rohita; but,\nin spite of the god\'s repeated demands, the fulfilment of the vow is\nconstantly deferred; till at last the youth, having been invested in armour,\nis told of the fate awaiting him. He, however, refuses to be sacrificed, and\nescapes to the forest. The king thereupon is seized with dropsy; and the son,\nhearing of this, hastens homeward to save his father. On the way he is met by\nIndra who urges him to wander, and he accordingly does so for a year. The same\nis repeated five different times. In the sixth year, the prince, while\nwandering in the forest, comes across a starving Brahman, A _g_ igarta, who\nlives there with his wife and three sons, and who consents to sell him one of\nhis sons for a hundred cows to serve him as a ransom to Varu _n_ a. The\nBrahman wishing to keep his eldest son, whilst the mother refuses to part with\nthe youngest, the choice falls upon\n\np. xxxv\n\nthe second boy, called _S_ una _h_ _s_ epa. Rohita now returns to his father\nwho, having been told of the transaction, then proposes to Varu _n_ a to offer\nthe Brahman youth in lieu of his son; and the god, deeming a Brahman better\nthan a Kshatriya, consents to the exchange, and orders the king to perform the\nRa _g_ asuya sacrifice, and to make the youth the chief victim on the Abhishe\n_k_ aniya, or day of consecration. Four renowned _Ri_ shis officiate as\noffering-priests but when the human sacrifice is to be consummated, no one\nwill undertake to bind the victim. The boy\'s own father, A _g_ igarta, then\nvolunteers to do so for another hundred cows; and subsequently he even\nundertakes to slay his son for a similar reward. But when the poor lad sees\nhis own father coming towards him, whetting his knife, and becomes aware that\nhe is really to be slain, \'as if he were not a man,\' he bethinks himself of\ncalling upon the gods for help; and by them he is successively referred from\none to another, till by uttering three verses in praise of Ushas, the Dawn, he\nis released from his fetters, whilst the king is freed from his malady.\nSubsequently one of the four priests, the royal sage Vi _s_ vamitra, receives\nSuna _h_ _s_ epa as his son, conferring upon him the name of Devarata\n(Theodotos), and refuses to give him up to A _g_ igarta; and when the latter\ncalls on his son to return to him, and not to desert his ancestral race, he\nreplies, \'What has never been found even amongst _S_ udras, thou hast been\nseen with a knife in thy hand, and hast taken three hundred cows for me, O\nA\xe1\xb9\x85giras!\' And on his father avowing his guilt, and promising to make over the\ncattle to him, he again replies, \'He who has once done wrong will commit\nanother sin; thou hast not abandoned the ways of a _S_ udra: what thou hast\ndone is irremediable\'; and \'is irremediable,\' echoes Vi _s_ vamitra, who then\nformally adopts him as his son.\n\nThis legend 1, so far from bearing witness to the existence\n\np. xxxvi\n\nof human sacrifices as a generally recognised practice, at the time when it\noriginated, would rather seem to mark this particular case as an exceptional\none. For, if it were not so, how comes it that the king\'s four high-priests--\nwho, if any, must have been looked upon as thorough masters of the sacrificial\nscience--should have refused to assist in the immolation of the human victim\nordered by the deity, leaving it to be accomplished by the sullied hands of\nthe wretched father? But there is another feature of the story which cannot\nbut strike one as very peculiar. Why should the childless king pray for the\nbirth of a son only to make a sacrifice of him? He has been told to do so by\nthe holy sage Narada: is one then to understand that the sage\'s advice, as\nwell as Varu _n_ a\'s consent, is given merely to try the king\'s faith and\ntruthfulness? If so, the case is similar to that of Abraham\'s sacrifice in the\nland of Moriah, only that the king\'s faith proves less intense and exalted--\nperhaps more humanly faint-hearted--than that of the Jewish patriarch. But the\nmost striking feature of the legend doubtless is the part played in it by the\nunnatural father; and this feature seems indeed to impart to the tale\nsomething of the character of an allegorical representation of the contrast\nbetween a barbarous (and perhaps earlier) and a more civilised phase of life\nand moral feeling 1. In this respect two points deserve to be noticed, viz.\nthe coarseness of the synonymous names (\'dog\'s tail\') of the three sons of the\nBrahman 2; and the fact that the latter belongs to the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras stock, a name\nintimately associated with superstitious\n\np. xxxvii\n\nrites 1 on the one hand, and with the ritual of the fire-altar 2 on the other.\n\nNow, it is exactly in connection with the building of the fire-altar that the\nclearest, and most unmistakable trace of an old practice of human sacrifices--\nor rather of the slaying of men for sacrificial purposes--occurs. In laying\ndown the bottom layer of the altar, the pan which had been used by the\nSacrificer for carrying about the sacred fire for a year is built into this\nlayer, with heads of the five recognised sacrificial animals 3\\--man, horse,\nox, sheep, and goat--put therein, in order to impart stability to the altar (\n_S_ at. Br. VII, 5, 2, I seqq.). In a previous passage of the Brahma _n_ a 4\n(I, 2, 3, 6 seq.),where the relative value of non-animal offering-materials\nand the five sacrificial animals is discussed, it was stated that, whilst the\ngods were making use of one after another of these animals, the sacrificial\nessence gradually passed from one to the other, thus rendering the previous\none useless for sacrifice, until it finally passed into the earth whence it\nentered the rice and barley afterwards used for sacrificial dishes. The\ngeneral purport of this passage would seem to be to indicate a gradual\ntendency towards substituting the lower for the higher animals, and ultimately\nvegetable for animal offerings; though, as a matter of fact, animals continued\nof\n\np. xxxviii\n\ncourse to be commonly sacrificed in later times. Now as regards the heads of\nthe five victims, the author subsequently (VI, 2, 1, 37 seqq.) makes some\nfurther remarks which go far to show that his previous statements referred\nonly to the traditional practice which, however, was no longer in use in his\nown day, and had probably not been so for generations past. He mentions\nvarious expedients adopted by some priests with a view to keeping up at least\nsome semblance of the old custom,--viz. either by procuring real heads from\nsome source or other, or by using heads made of gold or clay; but they are\nsummarily dismissed as profane and fraudulent counterfeits; and the author\nthen remarks somewhat vaguely and diplomatically that \'one may slay those five\nvictims as far as one may be able (or inclined) to do so, for Pra _g_ apati\nwas the first to slaughter them, and _S_ yapar _n_ a Sayakayana the last, and\nin the interval also people used to slaughter them; but at the present day\npeople slaughter only (one of 1) those two, the (he-goat) for Pra _g_ apati,\nand the one for Vayu;\' after which he proceeds to explain in detail the\npractice then in ordinary use. Later on (VII, 5, 2, 1 seqq.), the Brahma _n_ a\nexpounds in the usual way the formulas used in the traditional, and\ntheoretically still available procedure, though in the actual performance\nperhaps only the formulas relating to the particular heads 2 used would be\nmuttered.\n\nWhile Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya thus, at least in theory, deals rather cautiously\nwith this feature of the traditional custom, the theologians of the Black Ya\n_g_ us 3 take up a somewhat bolder position. Indeed it is evidently against\nthis older school of ritualists that some of the censure of our Brahma _n_ a\nis directed. For though they too allow, as an alternative practice, the use of\na complete set of five heads, they make\n\np. xxxix\n\nno mention of a man being killed for this purpose, but enjoin that a dead\nman\'s head is to be bought for twenty-one beans 1, which is then to be laid\nagainst an ant-hill with seven holes in order to again supply it with the\nseven \'vital airs of the head\'; whereupon three stanzas relating to Yama are\nto be sung round about it to redeem it from the god of death. Besides the four\nanimals, there is also to be a he-goat sacred to Pra _g_ apati, the offering\nof which is to complete the animal sacrifice 2, In this school also 3, the\nordinary practice, however, is to kill only a he-goat for Vayu Niyutvat, and\nto use its head for putting it in the pan placed in the bottom layer of the\naltar. As regards the _Ri_ g-veda ritual, the Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a, as\nProf. Weber has pointed out, leaves a choice between a he-goat for Pra _g_\napati and one for Vayu; whilst the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-sutra, curiously enough,\nagain adds the alternative course of using the set of five heads.\n\nThe same scholar has drawn attention to another rite in the sacrificial\nceremonial which seems to him to show clear traces of human sacrifice. At the\npurificatory bath at the end of the A _s_ vamedha, the Sacrificer is to be\npurged of any guilt he may have committed against Varu _n_ a by an oblation\nmade to _G_ umbaka (Varu _n_ a) on the bald head of a man possessed of certain\nrepulsive features, whilst standing in the water. To these particulars,--as\ngiven in the present work (XIII, 3, 6, 5), the Taitt. Brahma _n_ a (III, 9,\n15), and Katyayana\'s Sutra (XX, 8, 16),-- _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana (XVI, 18)\n\np. xl\n\nagain adds further particulars, viz. that the man is to be a Brahma _n_ a of\nthe \xc3\x82treya family, bought (or hired) for a thousand cows, and that he is to\nenter the river till the water flows into his mouth. Now Prof. Weber is of\nopinion that this ceremony would be meaningless if the man were not actually\ndrowned. I fail, however, to see the necessity of this assumption, seeing that\neven a purely symbolical interpretation of the ceremony will give it all the\nsignificance of the real act. That the Ya _g_ us texts contain nothing that\ncould make one suspect that the man was actually drowned is beyond doubt; but\neven _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana\'s statement that the water is to flow into his mouth is\nprobably only meant to suggest the nearness and semblance of death by\ndrowning. Otherwise the oblation could hardly have been performed in anything\nlike a decent form. Besides, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana further states that, after the\ncompletion of the oblation, \'they drive him (the man) out, thinking that the\nguilt of the village-outcasts is (thereby) driven out 1.\' Here the verb \'ni\n_h_ -sidh\' could hardly have been used if the man was to be driven farther\ninto the water. What is meant is probably that the man was to be driven out\nfrom the water, and possibly also from the village, to live an anchorite\'s\nlife in the forest.\n\nIf now we turn our attention to the Purushamedha, or \'human sacrifice\' proper,\nwe find that the Ya _g_ us texts, as far as they deal with this ceremony at\nall 2, treat it as\n\np. xli\n\na purely symbolical performance. A large number of men and women, apparently\nintended to represent all classes of the community, are bound to eleven\nsacrificial posts, and after the necessary rites, concluding with the\n\'paryagnikara _n_ a\'--or the carrying of fire round the oblations--have been\nperformed on them, they are one and all set free; the sacrifice then\nproceeding with the offering of the set of eleven animal victims. That the\nceremony in this form, with its pedantically elaborate array of symbolic human\nvictims, cannot possibly lay claim to any very great antiquity is self-\nevident; the only question is whether it has not come to take the place of\nsome other form of human sacrifice. Now, after the foregoing statement of\nfacts, it would be idle to deny that the existence, at one time, of a simple\nform of human sacrifice is not only quite possible, but is indeed highly\nprobable; and it would be no more than might be expected, if such a practice\nshould eventually have revolted the moral sense of the more refined classes of\nthe community 1, just as it happened, little more than a hundred years ago, in\nthe case of the scarcely less odious practice of the burning of witches in\nChristian lands.\n\nThe practice of human sacrifices seems, however, to receive evidence of a yet\nmore direct and unmistakable kind than the facts hitherto mentioned, from the\nceremonial of the Purushamedha, as set forth in the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana and Vaitana\nSutras. If this evidence has been reserved here to the last, it is because\nthere seems reason to believe that, in the form in which it is presented in\nthose works, the sacrifice was never actually performed, and probably never\nmeant to be performed, but that we have here to do with a mere theoretical\nscheme intended to complete the sacrificial system. The importance of the\nsubject makes it, however, desirable that we should take a somewhat closer\nview of the procedure of the \'human sacrifice,\' as laid down in those two\nSutras.\n\np. xlii\n\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kh.

Indeed, it seems to me by no means unlikely that the two\ndifferent schemes of the Purushamedha originated at about the same time, and\nthat they were intended to fill up a gap in the sacrificial system which\nseemed to require for Man, as the chief sacrificial animal, a more definite\nand, so to speak, a more dignified place in the ceremonial than was up to that\ntime accorded to him. The circumstance that the account of this sacrifice, as\ngiven in the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-sutra, presents some of the ordinary features of\nBrahma _n_ a diction, and that it is indeed actually assigned by the\ncommentary to the Maha-Kaushitaka, should not be allowed to weigh with us,\nsince this is most likely done for the very purpose of securing for this\nscheme some sort of authoritative sanction of respectable\n\np. xlv\n\nantiquity 1. For seeing that the older ritualistic works know nothing of it,\nit seems sufficiently evident that this human sacrifice could not possibly\nhave been _rite_ performed in _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana\'s time, since no proper priest--no\ngenuine Adhvaryu and Udgat _ri_ , at all events--could have been found to\nperform it. And, indeed, it can scarcely be without significance that the\nAtharva-sutra is the only other work which recognises the ceremony; and that\nnearly all the hymns and verses used in connection with the immolation of the\nhuman victim are taken from the Atharvan and the tenth ma _n_ _d_ ala of the\n_Ri_ k. Nay, the very fact that, in both Sutra works, this sacrifice is\nrepresented as being undertaken, not for the great object of winning immortal\nlife, but for the healing of the Sacrificer\'s bodily infirmities, might seem\nsufficient to stamp the ceremony as one partaking more of the nature of the\nsuperstitious rites of the Atharvan priests than of that of the great\nsacrifices of the traditional _S_ rauta ritual.\n\nIf thus we find it impossible to recognise the Purushamedha as a genuine\nmember of the sacrificial system, this is still more the case as regards the\nSarvamedha, or all-sacrifice, a ten days\' performance which includes amongst\nits component parts, not only the Purushamedha, but also the A _s_ vamedha,\nthe Va _g_ apeya, and the Vi _s_ va _g_ it with all the Stomas and P _ri_ sh\n_th_ as,--it thus being the very ceremonial performance that might seem\ncalculated to fitly crown the edifice of the sacrificial theory. As regards\nthe ritualistic treatment of this sacrifice, the number of authorities dealing\nwith it shows a further diminution from that of the Purushamedha. For whilst\nthe _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a agrees with the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana and Vaitana Sutras\non the general features of its ritual--with the exception, of course, of the\nradical difference as to the character of the human sacrifice--the Taittiriya-\nbrahma _n_ a, which gave at least the list of the symbolic victims of the\nPurushamedha, is altogether silent on the Sarvamedha; this ceremony being,\n\np. xlvi\n\nhowever, dealt with in some of the Sutra works connected with the Black Ya _g_\nus.\n\nThe concluding chapter of the thirteenth ka _n_ _d_ a contains a valuable and\ninteresting account of the preparation of the burial-place or sepulchral\nmound, and the interment of the charred bones previously preserved, in an urn\nor jar, for some indefinite period since the burning of the dead body. Of\nespecial interest, in this account, is the statement that the bones, when\ncommitted to the grave, are to be arranged in accordance with their natural\nposition, the spaces between them being then filled up with bricks in such a\nway as to present, as in the case of the fire-altar, a fancied resemblance to\nthe shape of a bird. It is difficult to see what explanation could be offered\nfor this feature of the obsequies, except a vague belief in some form of\nfuture resurrection.\n\nThe fourteenth ka _n_ _d_ a, up to the beginning of the Brihad-ara _n_ yaka,\nis entirely taken up with the exposition of the Pravargya, an important,\nthough optional and subsidiary, ceremony performed on the Upasad-days of Soma-\nsacrifices. Whilst the central feature of this sacrificial performance\nconsists of a ceremony of an apparently simple and unpretending character,\nviz. the preparation of a hot draught of milk and ghee, the Gharma, which the\nSacrificer has to take, after oblations have been made thereof to various\ndeities, the whole rite is treated with a considerable amount of mystic\nsolemnity calculated to impart to it an air of unusual significance. A special\nimportance is, however, attached to the rough clay pot, used for boiling the\ndraught, and manufactured and baked in the course of the performance itself;\nit is called Mahavira, i.e. the great man or hero, and Samra _g_ , or\nsovereign lord, and is made the object of fervid adoration as though it were a\nveritable deity of well-nigh paramount power.\n\nAlthough the history of this ceremony is somewhat obscure, the place assigned\nto it in the Soma-ritual would lead one to suppose that its introduction must\nhave taken place at a time when the main procedure of the Soma-sacrifice had\nalready been definitely settled. This conclusion\n\np. xlvii\n\nis also borne out by the position taken up towards this ceremony by the\nauthorities of the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda. For whilst the Maitraya _n_ iya Sa\n_m_ hita gives at least the formulas used for it, the Ka _th_ aka, on the\nother hand, takes no notice whatever of it, and the Taittiriya school only\ndeals with it in its \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. Nevertheless, this ceremony can boast of a\nrespectable antiquity, seeing that it is treated of at some length in the\nBrahma _n_ as of the _Ri_ k--viz. Ait. Br. 1, 18-22; Kaush. Br. VIII, 3-7; and\nthis circumstance alone might almost seem to justify the inference that it was\nin that very school of ritualists that this item of the sacrificial ceremonial\nwas first elaborated. It is very doubtful, however, whether such an inference\nwould find any support in the dogmatic explanation of the ceremony offered by\nsome of the theologians of the _Ri_ g-veda. At the end of the Pravargya\nsection, in a passage which has a somewhat disconnected appearance, and seems\nhardly in consonance with previous dogmatic explanations, the Aitareya-brahma\n_n_ a makes the secret import of the ceremony to be that of a mystic union of\nthe gods resulting in the generation of a new, divine body for the Sacrificer.\nThis explanation, having been previously adopted by Haug and Garbe, was\nrecorded without question in a note to part ii (p. 104) of this translation.\nFurther consideration of this matter has, however, convinced me that the\ntheory. referred to fails altogether to account for the origin of the\nceremony, as well as for important points in its performance which find a\nready explanation in the theory applied to it by the present work, as well as\nby the Taittiriya-\xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka and the Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a. For seeing\nthat the main object of sacrificial performances generally is the\nreconstruction of Pra _g_ apati, the personified universe, and (the divine\nbody of) the Sacrificer, it is difficult to see why, for this latter purpose,\na new and special ceremony should have been thought necessary; and, besides,\nthe rejected theory, if it is at all to account for the high honour rendered\nto the Mahavira pot, would almost involve the recognition of a form of Li\xe1\xb9\x85ga-\nworship which surely would require very much stronger evidence than the\nisolated and\n\np. xlviii\n\n[paragraph continues] (to my mind) somewhat suspicious passage on which this\ntheory is based.\n\nNow, as regards the rival theory underlying the exposition of the Pravargya,\nas given in the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a, it makes the Mahavira pot a symbol\nof the sun, whilst the hot milk draught represents the divine flood of life\nand light with which the performer of the ceremony becomes imbued. These\nsymbolic interpretations, whatever we may think of them otherwise, certainly\nadapt themselves admirably to the general sacrificial imagery. As the sun is\nthe head of the universe--or, in figurative language, the head of Pra _g_\napati, the world-man--so its earthly, and earthen, counterpart, the Mahavira\npot, is the head of Vish _n_ u, the sacrificial man, and the Sacrificer; and\nthis ceremony is thus performed in order to complete the universe and\nsacrifice, as well as the divine body of the Sacrificer, by supplying them\nwith their head, their crowning-piece, so to speak; and to imbue them with the\ndivine essence of life and light. For this purpose the theory rather\ningeniously avails itself of certain myths vaguely alluded to in the _Ri_\ng-veda, according to which (X, 171, 2) Indra cut off the head of Makha (here\nidentified with Vish _n_ u, the sacrifice and the sun-god); and (I, 116, 12;\n117, 22; 119, 9) Dadhya _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ , the son of Atharvan, was fitted by the A _s_\nvins with a horse\'s head, and this hippocephalous creature then communicated\nto them the Madhu, or sweet thing,--that is, as would appear, the sweet\ndoctrine of the Soma, the drink of immortality. This symbolism readily\nexplains some points connected with the Pravargya ceremony, for which no\nobvious reason seems otherwise to suggest itself. For one thing, it accounts\nfor the deep reverence shown to the Gharma vessel, which, in fact, is no other\nthan the giver of light and life himself; whilst the optional character of the\nceremony explains itself from the fact that the Soma-cup, of which the\nSacrificer will subsequently partake, might of itself be expected to supply\nhim with the blessings which he hopes to derive from the Pravargya. And,\nfinally, it also becomes clear why the Pravargya must not form part of a man\'s\nfirst performance of a Soma-sacrifice.\n\np. xlix\n\n[paragraph continues] For the Pravargya, as we have seen, is performed on the\npreliminary days of the Soma-sacrifice, before the pressing of the Soma has\ntaken place; and it obviously is only after he has actually partaken of the\nSoma-drink, and has thereby potentially \'put on immortality,\' that he can\npartake of the Gharma, and thus become imbued with the celestial light 1. The\ndogmatical explanation of this ceremony thus puts, as it were, the finishing\ntouch to that strange allegory by which the Indian theologians sought to make\nthe sacrificial ceremonial a practical illustration of that unity of the All\nwhich speculation had been striving to compass since the days when the\nemptiness of the Vedic pantheon had dawned upon the thinking mind, and when\ncritically inclined bards ventured to sing of the national god 2: \'Not for a\nsingle day hast thou fought, nor hast thou any enemy, O Maghavan: illusion is\nwhat they say concerning thy battles; no foe hast thou fought either to-day or\naforetime.\'\n\nAs regards the optional and somewhat recondite character of the Pravargya\nceremony, it is probably not without significance that the section dealing\ntherewith is combined with the speculative B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka so as to\nmake up with it the last book of the Brahma _n_ a; the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka-ka _n_ _d_\na, or forest section. Such, at least, is the case in the Madhyandina text,\nwhere the Pravargya section occupies the first three adhyayas of the last\n(fourteenth) book; whilst the Ka _n_ va text presents a slight difficulty in\nthis respect. What passes generally as the seventeenth (and last) ka _n_ _d_ a\nof that version, consists of the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka; whilst the sixteenth\nka _n_ _d_ a begins with the section on funeral rites, corresponding to the\nlast\n\np. l\n\n[paragraph continues] (eighth) adhyaya of ka _n_ _d_ a XIII of the Madhyandina\nrecension, and is stated 1 to include also the Pravargya section (Madhy. XIV,\n1-3). Now it is a strange fact that the six adhyayas of the B _ri_ hadara _n_\nyaka (XIV, 4-9 in the Madhyandina text) are counted 3-8 in the Ka _n_ va text,\n--a circumstance which manifestly can only be explained by the Pravargya\nsection being taken to form the first two adhyayas of the last book of that\nversion. This, indeed, is probably implied in the remark added to the\ndescription of a MS. of the Ka _n_ va text in the catalogue of the MSS. of the\nSansk _ri_ t College, Benares (p. 44), according to which \'Pravargyaka _n_ _d_\nasya patra _n_ i\' are \'bhinnaprama _n_ akshara _n_ i,\'--that is, \'the leaves\nof the Pravargya section have a special pagination\' (? i.e. they are numbered\nindependently of the section on funeral rites preceding them).\n\nAnd now my task is done, and I must take leave of this elaborate exposition of\nthe sacrificial ordinances of Indian theology. For well-nigh a score of years\nthe work has \'dragged its slow length along,\' and during that time it has\ncaused me--and, I doubt not, has caused some of my readers, too--not a few\nweary hours. In the early stages of the work, my old teacher, Professor\nAlbrecht Weber, than whom no one is more deeply versed in the intricacies of\nthe sacrificial ritual, wrote to me: \'You have undertaken a difficult, a most\ndifficult task; and I can only hope that your courage and patience will not\nfail you before you are through with it.\' And, indeed, I must confess that\nmany a time I felt as if I should never be able to get through my task; and\nbut for Professor Max Muller\'s timely exhortations and kindly encouragement,\nthe work might perhaps never have been completed. \'I know,\' he once wrote to\nme, \'you will thank me one day for having pressed you to go on with your\nwork;\' and now I do indeed thank him most sincerely and with all my heart for\nthe kindness and patience he has shown me these many years. But, strange to\nsay, now that the work is completed, I feel as if I could not do without\nworking at it; and certainly, if\n\np. li\n\na second edition could ever have been required of a work of this kind, it\nwould have found me ready once more to work my way through the bewildering\nmaze of rites; and I know only too well that I should have to correct many a\nmistake, and could improve many an awkwardly expressed passage. In conclusion,\na word of cordial thanks is due to the staff of the University Press, whose\npatience must often have been severely tried in the course of the printing of\nthis work, and who, by the excellence of their presswork, and by their careful\nsupervision, have materially lightened my task, and saved me much tedious and\nirksome labour.\n\nJ.

The Sat. Br. does\nnot allude to the expiatory character of the offering, but there can be no\ndoubt that it is of an essentially piacular significance.

Cf. Taitt. Br. III, 9, 15, \'At the lustral bath he offers the last\noblation with "To _G_ umbaka hail!

One might\npossibly refer \'sva _m_ \' to the horse, but this would make the construction\nrather harsh.

I, 162, 2. \'When, held by the mouth\n(by the bridle)., they lead round the offering of the (horse) covered with\nrich trappings, the all-coloured he-goat goes bleating in front right\neastwards to the dear seat of Indra and Pushan. 3. This he-goat, fit for all\nthe gods, is led in front of the swift horse as Pushan\'s share; like (?) the\nwelcome cake, Tvash _t_ _ri_ promotes it, along with the steed, to great\nglory. 4. When thrice the men duly lead around the horse meet for offering\nalong the way to the gods, then the he-goat walks first, announcing the\nsacrifice to the gods. . . . 16. The cloth which they spread (for the horse to\nlie upon) and the upper cloth and the gold, the halter, the steed, the shackle\n--these they bring up as acceptable to the gods.\'--I, 163, 12. \'Forth came the\nswift steed to the slaughter, musing with reverent mind; his mate, the he-\ngoat, is led in front; and behind go the wise singers.\'\n\n[xxv:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_22) According to the Taittiriyas, this second he-goat\nis tied to the cord surrounding the horse\'s limbs somewhere above the neck of\nthe horse.\n\n[xxvi:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_23) See , note [5](sbe44086.htm#fn_781).\n\n[xxvi:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_24) It has even been supposed to be merely a\ncondensed version of a comparatively modern work ascribed to _G_ aimini, the\n(A _s_ vamedha-parvan of the) _G_ aimini-Bharata.\n\n[xxvii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_25) Vyasa remarks to Yudhish _th_ ira (XIV, 2071),\nFor the A _s_ vamedha, O king of kings, cleanses away all ill-deeds: by\nperforming it thou wilt without doubt become free from sin.\' Cf. Sat. Br.\n[XIII, 3, 1, 1](sbe44094.htm#13:3:1:1), \'Thereby the gods redeem all sin, yea,\neven the slaying of a Brahman they thereby redeem; and he who performs the A\n_s_ vamedha redeems all sin, he redeems even the slaying of a Brahman.\' As a\nrule, however, greater stress is laid in the Brahma _n_ a on the efficacy of\nthe ceremonial in ensuring supreme sway to the king, and security of life and\nproperty to his subjects.\n\n[xxvii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_26) The \'rukma\' is borne by the Agni _k_ it, or\nbuilder of a fire-altar, which is required for the A _s_ vamedha; cf. VI, 7,\n1, 1.\n\n[xxvii:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_27) It is carefully selected by charioteers and\npriests, Mahabh. XIV, 2087.\n\n[xxvii:4](sbe44002.htm#fr_28) Whilst, according to the Brahma _n_ a ([XIII, 4,\n2, 5](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:5)), the body of \'keepers\' is to consist of 100\nroyal princes clad in armour, 100 noblemen armed with swords, 100 sons of\nheralds and headmen bearing quivers and arrows, and 100 sons of attendants and\ncharioteers bearing staves; the epic gives no details, except that it states\nthat \'a disciple of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, skilled in sacrificial rites, and\nwell-versed in the Veda, went along with the son of P _ri_ tha to perform the\npropitiatory rites,\' and that \'many Brahma _n_ as conversant with the Veda,\nand many Kshatriyas followed him at the king\'s behest.\'\n\n[xxviii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_29) That is, real or symbolic, only the\ndomesticated animals being offered, whilst the wild ones are set free after\nthe ceremony of \'paryagnikara _n_ a.\' Amongst these animals the poet curiously\nenough also mentions (XIV, 2542) \'v _ri_ ddhast _ri_ ya _h_ ,\' which Pratapa\nChandra Ray translates by \'old women.\' This is of course impossible; if it is\nnot a wrong reading, it has doubtless to be taken in the sense of \'old female\n(kine),\' probably the (25) barren cows offered at the end of the A _s_ vamedha\nto Mitra-Varu _n_ a, the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ , and B _ri_ haspati ([XIII, 5, 4,\n25](sbe44109.htm#13:5:4:25)) being intended. In its enumeration of the\nvictims, the Taitt. Sa _m_ hita (V, 6, 21) indeed mentions \'vaira _g_ i\npurushi,\' taken by the commentator to mean \'two human females consecrated to\nVira _g_.\' If it be for this or a similar purpose that the \'v _ri_ ddha-st\n_ri_ ya _h_ \' were intended, we may refer to Taitt. Br. III, 9, 8, where it is\ndistinctly stated that \'the man\' and the wild animals are to be released as\nsoon as the \'paryagnikara _n_ am\' has been performed on them. But no \'man\'\nbeing mentioned amongst the victims, Saya _n_ a p. xxix takes the \'purusham\'\nhere to refer to the \'vaira _g_ i purushi\' mentioned in the Sa _m_ hita.\nPerhaps, however, this passage has rather a wider sense, referring to human\nvictims generally at any sacrifice.\n\n[xxix:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_30) Draupadi\'s Asva-upasa _m_ vesanam is referred to,\nbut no further particulars are mentioned.\n\n[xxix:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_31) The king\'s object, in performing the sacrifice,\nwas to obtain the birth of a son. Cf. Sat. Br. [XIII, 1, 9,\n9](sbe44082.htm#13:1:9:9), \'for from of old a hero was born to him who had\nperformed the (A _s_ vamedha) sacrifice.\'\n\n[xxx:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_32) Whilst cattle-lifting generally, such as formed\nthe object of the invasion of the land of the Matsyas by the Trigartas (as\nrelated in the Vira _t_ a-parvan), was probably a practice pretty prevalent\nfrom ancient times, the stealing of the sacrificial horse would offer an\nadditional temptation, from the political point of view, on account of the\nexceptional character of the animal as the symbol of its master\'s claim to\nparamountcy.\n\n[xxx:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_33) Sat. Br. [XIII, 1, 6, 3](sbe44079.htm#13:1:6:3);\nTaitt. Br. III, 8, 9, 4.\n\n[xxx:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_34) One might feel inclined to take this specification\nof that month as implying the existence, at the poet\'s time, of the practice\nof confining the horse in a pen or shed (made of A _s_ vattha palings) during\nthe last two months, mentioned Taitt. Br. III, 8, 12, 2.\n\n[xxxi:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_35) See [XIII, I, 5, 1](sbe44078.htm#13:1:5:1) seqq.;\n[4, 2, 8](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:8) seqq.; Taitt. Br. III, 9, 14. In connection\nwith the revolving legend,\' the conductors of bands of lute-players seem to\nhave sung additional stanzas in which the royal Sacrificer was associated with\npious kings of old; see [XIII, 4, 3, 3](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:3).\n\n[xxxii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_36) It is hardly likely that some of the texts\nmentioned (deva _g_ anavidya, sarpavidya, &c.) refer merely to portions of the\nVedic texts.\n\n[xxxii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_37) The singing of stanzas in honour of the king, by\na Brahma _n_ a and a Kshatriya, with the accompaniment of lutes, on the other\nhand, does form part of the Taittiriya ritual. Taitt. Br. III, 9, 24.\n\n[xxxiii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_38) Whilst the three Sa _m_ hitas contain no\nsection relating to the Purushamedha, the Taittiriya-brahma _n_ a (III, 4)\nenumerates the (symbolic) human victims in much the same way as does the Va\n_g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita (see the present vol. [p. 413](sbe44111.htm#page_413)\nseqq.); and the \xc3\x82pastamba-sutra makes the performance similar to what it is in\nthe White Ya _g_ us texts. The Vaitana-sutra of the Atharva-veda also makes it\na five days\' performance.\n\n[xxxiii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_39) Like the chapter on the A _s_ vamedha, that on\nthe Purushamedha is stated to be taken from the Maha-Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a.\n\n[xxxiii:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_40) On this question see especially A. Weber,\nZeitsch. d. D. M. G. 18, p. 262 ff., repr. in Indische Streifen, II, p. 54 ff.\n\n[xxxiv:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_41) See part iii, p. 95.\n\n[xxxiv:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_42) Cf. Max Muller, History of Ancient Sanskrit\nLiterature, p. 108 ff.; M. Hang, Aitareya-brahma _n_ a, II, p. 460 ff.; R.\nRoth, Weber\'s Ind. Stud. I, 475 ff.; II, 112 ff.\n\n[xxxv:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_43) The earliest reference to the myth or story of\nSuna _h_ _s_ epa is in _Ri_ g-veda I, 24, 11-13; V, 2, 7, where he is\napparently alluded to as having been actually p. xxxvi rescued from the stake,\nor from (three) stakes to which he was bound either for sacrifice, or, as Roth\nprefers, for torture.\n\n[xxxvi:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_44) In the Sabhaparvan of the Mahabharata (II, 6275\nseqq.),, as was first pointed out by Lassen, K _ri_ sh _n_ a accuses _G_\narasandha, king of Magadha and _K_ edi, residing at Mathura, of having carried\noff numerous vanquished kings and princes to his city, and keeping them\nconfined in his mountain stronghold with a view to afterwards sacrificing them\n(at his Ra _g_ asuya) to the lord of Uma (Rudra); adding subsequently (v. 864)\nthat \'the immolation of men was never seen at any time.\'\n\n[xxxvi:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_45) His own mime \'A _g_ igarta,\' on the other hand,\nis taken by the St. Petersburg Dictionary to mean \'one who has nothing to\nswallow,\' and would thus be merely descriptive of his condition of life.\n\n[xxxvii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_46) Viz. in their connection with the Atharva-veda.\nIn Mahabh. V, 548-51 A\xe1\xb9\x85giras praises Indra by means of \'Atharvavedamantrai\n_h_.\' Cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 237.\n\n[xxxvii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_47) Both in making the fire-pan (ukha) and in\nlaying down the bricks of the fire-altar, the expression \'a\xe1\xb9\x85girasvat\' (as in\nthe case of A\xe1\xb9\x85giras) frequently occurs in the formulas; cf. VI, 1, 2, 28; 3,\n1, 38 ff.; 4, 1, 1 ff.\n\n[xxxvii:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_48) All that is said in the Brahma _n_ a regarding\nthe headless bodies of the five victims is (VI, 2, 1, 7 seqq.) that Pra _g_\napati, having cut off the heads, and put them on (the altar, i.e. on himself),\nplunged four of the trunks into the water, and brought the sacrifice to a\ncompletion by (offering) the he-goat (not a he-goat, as translated), and that\nhe subsequently gathered up the water and mud (clay) in which those corpses\nhad lain, and used them for making bricks for the altar. The view that the\nother four bodies should likewise he offered is rejected by the author, who\nrather seems to suggest that they should be allowed to float away on the\nwater.\n\n[xxxvii:4](sbe44002.htm#fr_49) A very similar passage occurs in Ait. Br. VI,\n8, on which cp. Max Muller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 420.\n\n[xxxviii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_50) This doubtless is what is meant (cf. Katy.\nXVI, 1, 38); and \'atha\' at the beginning of VI, 2, 2, 6 ought accordingly to\nhave been taken in the rather unusual sense of \'or\' (? \'or rather\'), instead\nof then.\' Cf. VI, 2, 2, 15.\n\n[xxxviii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_51) According to \xc3\x82p. _S_ r. XVI, 17, 19-20,\nhowever, even if there is only one head (that of Vayu\'s he-goat) all the\nformulas are to be pronounced over it.\n\n[xxxviii:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_52) The Maitr. Sa _m_ hita, however, does not seem\nto refer to this particular point in its Brahma _n_ a sections.\n\n[xxxix:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_53) Or, according to \xc3\x82pastamba, for seven beans; the\nhead to be that of a Kshatriya or a Vai _s_ ya killed either by an arrow-shot\nor by lightning, and apparently to be severed from the body at the time of\npurchase (which, as Professor Weber rightly remarks, is a merely symbolic\none). As, however, the particulars given by \xc3\x82pastamba are not mentioned in the\nolder works, they may not unlikely have been introduced by him to meet some of\nthe objections raised by the Va _g_ asaneyins to whose views he generally pays\nsome attention. Otherwise the transaction might seem rather suspicious.\n\n[xxxix:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_54) Taitt. S. V, 1, 83, indeed, seems to speak of\nthe other four animals being set free after fire has been carried round, so\nthat their sacrificial use would he merely symbolical. Whether in that case\nonly the head of the one animal would be used, or the man\'s head along with\nit, seems doubtful.\n\n[xxxix:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_55) Cf. Taitt. S. V, 5.\n\n[xl:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_56) The compound \'ni _h_ shiddhapapmana _h_ (apagrama\n_h_ ) \'may possibly be meant in the sense that the evil deeds of the outcasts\nare driven out (prevented from troubling the peace of the village); Katy. XX,\n8, 17-18, however, states that when the Sacrificer has stepped out (of the\nwater), evil-doers enter (to bathe in the water) without having performed any\n(other) rites, and that they are then said to be \'purified by the A _s_\nvamedha.\'\n\n[xl:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_57) Besides the description of the ceremony in the\npresent work (XIII, 6, 1-2, 20), only the Taittiriya-brahma _n_ a (III, 4)\nseems to refer to it, enumerating merely the would-be victims who, according\nto \xc3\x82pastamba, as quoted by Saya _n_ a, are eventually set free. Professor\nWeber\'s suggestion that they may possibly at one time have been intended to be\nall of them slaughtered can hardly have been meant seriously. One might as\nwell suppose that, at the A _s_ vamedha, all the \'evil-doers\' who, according\nto Katyayana, are to bathe in the river, were meant to be drowned.\n\n[xli:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_58) When the practice became generally recognised that\nthe Sacrificer (and priests) should eat a portion of the offered victim, this\nalone would, as Professor Weber suggests, have tended to make human sacrifices\nimpracticable.\n\n[xlii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_59) The A _s_ vamedha section of the same work\nbegins:--Pra _g_ apati desired, \'May I gain all my desires, may I attain all\nattainments.\' He beheld this three days\' sacrificial performance, the A _s_\nvamedha, and took it, and offered with it; and by offering with it he gained\nall his desires, and attained all attainments.\n\n[xlii:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_60) See [XIII, 4, 2,\n6](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:6)-[17](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:17).\n\n[xlii:3](sbe44002.htm#fr_61) See p. xxxii.\n\n[xlii:4](sbe44002.htm#fr_62) See [XIII, 2, 2, 2](sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:2), seqq.\n\n[xliii:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_63) That is, as it would seem, with a view to\ndissuading her husband from offering himself as a victim.\n\n[xliv:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_64) Dr. Garbe, in his translation, makes this and the\nsubsequent rules refer (erroneously I think) to the animal victims of rule 21.\n\n[xlv:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_65) On this and other passages referred to the Maha-\nKaushitaka, cp. Professor Aufrecht\'s judicious remarks, Ait. Br., p. v.\n\n[xlix:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_66) The Kaushitaki-brahma _n_ a (VIII, 3), on the\nother hand, seems to justify the prohibition on the ground that, prior to the\nfirst complete Soma-sacrifice, the body of the Sacrifice (and Sacrificer) is\nincomplete, and therefore not ready to receive its head, in the shape of the\nPravargya. Hence also the same work allows the Pravargya to be performed at\nthe first Soma-sacrifice of one who is thoroughly versed in the scriptures,\nsince such a one is himself the body, or self, of the sacrifice.\n\n[xlix:2](sbe44002.htm#fr_67) See [XI, 1, 6, 10](sbe44008.htm#11:1:6:10).\n\n[l:1](sbe44002.htm#fr_68) Cf.
