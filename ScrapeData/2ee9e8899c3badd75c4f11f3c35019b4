Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said,--O\ngreat king! I will relate, how Shree Krishnu Chund conquered Joorasindhoo and\nhis army, destroyed the right of the dead, released Moochkoond, and, having\nleft Bruj, took up his abode in Dwarka: listen with the greatest attention.\n\nThe Raja Oogursen ruled over Muttra with great skill and policy; and Shree\nKrishnu and Bulram, like servants, were obedient to his orders. Under his\ngovernment all his subjects were happy; except the widows of Kuns, who were\ngreatly grieved at the loss of their husband. They could not sleep, and had no\nsensation of hunger or thirst. During the whole eight puhurs, they were in a\nstate of sorrow.\n\nOne day the two sisters, being deeply engaged in thought, said to each other,\n"A woman has no excellence without her husband, as the subject has no\nexcellence without his lord, or night without the moon. As we have lost our\nhusbands, we ought not to stay here now; and it is better for us to go and\nlive in the house of our father."\n\nO great king! the two queens, having thus determined, sent for a ruth, and\ntravelled in it from Muttra to their father\'s house, in the Behar country; and\nwith tears related to him, how Shree Krishnu and Bulram had. destroyed Kuns\nand all evil spirits.\n\np. 192\n\nOn hearing their account, Joorasindhoo entered his court in great wrath, and\nsaid, "What powerful men are these, who have been born in the family of Judoo,\nand have made my daughters widows, after destroying the very powerful Kuns and\nall evil spirits? I will attack them with my whole army; and destroying with\nfire the city of Muttra, and all the family and descendants of Judoo, will\ncarry off Bulram and Krishnu bound and alive: otherwise my name is not\nJoorasindh."\n\nHaving thus spoken, he wrote letters to all the neighbouring Rajas, asking\nthem to come to him with their armies; as he was about to revenge himself for\nthe death of Kuns, by destroying all the descendants of Judoo, and making\ntheir race extinct. On receiving Joorasindhoo\'s letters, all the Rajas of the\ndifferent countries came quickly with their forces; and Joorasindhoo also\narranged and prepared his army.\n\nAt length when Joorasindhoo took his departure from the Behar country to\nMuttra with all his army of demons, he had twenty-three complete armies with\nhim; each army consisting of 21,817 charioteers and as many men mounted on\nelephants: 109,350 foot soldiers and 66,000 horsemen. Such were the twenty-\nthree complete armies he had with him, each demon of which was powerful beyond\ndescription. O great king! when Joorasindhoo, accompanied with all his army of\nevil spirits, advanced, sounding the kettle-drum, the guardians of the ten\nquarters began to shake and tremble, and the gods to fly through fear. The\nearth apart began to be agitated, like the roof of a house, from the load. At\nlength, after some days\' progress he arrived, and surrounded the city of\nMuttra on all sides. Upon this, the inhabitants of the city went in the\ngreatest alarm to Shree Krishnu Chund, and exclaimed, "O great king!\nJoorasindhoo has encompassed our city on all sides; what shall we do, and\nwhere shall we go?"\n\nOn hearing these words, Huri reflected for a short time; and Bulram having, in\nthe mean while, come to him, said, "O great king, you have descended upon the\nearth to remove the\n\np. 193\n\nmiseries of your worshippers, be pleased now to assume a body of fire, and\ndestroy the forest in the form of an evil spirit." At these words Shree\nKrishnu Chund went with him to Oogursen, and said, "O great king! give us an\norder to fight, and do you, having taken all the descendants of Judoo with\nyou, [protect](errata.htm#7) the fort." After these words, when they came to\ntheir father and mother, all the inhabitants of the city came round them and\nbeing greatly agitated began to say, "O Krishnu! how shall we escape from the\nhands of these demons?" Huri, perceiving that his mother and father and all\nthe other people were alarmed, explained to them and said, Suffer not any\nanxiety; this army of demons, which you now see, shall in a moment be\ndispersed in every direction, in the same manner that bubbles disappear in the\nwater."\n\nHaving thus explained, and restored their confidence, he took leave; and as\nKrishnu advanced, the gods sent two ruths, filled with arms for him. The\nchariots stood before them, and the two brothers entered them.\n\nThe two chiefs of the family of Judoo went forth and reached Joorasindhoo\'s\narmy safely, they came to the place where Joorasindhoo was standing. On seeing\nthem Joorasindhoo said with great haughtiness to Shree Krishnu Chund, "Fly\nfrom before me, why should I kill you, you are not my equal that I should\nattack you? I will see what Bulram is made of." Shree Krishnu Chund replied,\n"O proud fool! what silly talk is this of yours. The brave never make high\nsounding speeches to any one; but behave with moderation to all; when occasion\nrequires they exhibit their power; can they be called brave, who extol their\nown greatness? There is a saying, that when it thunders, it does not rain; so,\nwherefore, do you talk boastingly?"\n\nAt these words, Joorasindhoo was enraged; and Shree Krishnu and Buldeo retired\na short distance, and stood in a state of preparation. He pursued and attacked\nthem with his whole army, and called out, "O wicked wretches! where will\n\np. 194\n\nyou fly from my presence? You have long escaped alive; I know not what may be\nyour thoughts, but you shall live no longer, I will send you and all the\ndescendants of Judoo to the same place, where Kuns and all his demons have\ngone."\n\nO great king! when that devil had made this wicked speech the two brothers\nretired some distance further, and stood. Shree Krishnu was armed with weapons\nof all kinds, and Bulram Jee with a plough and wooden pestle. As the army of\ndemons approached them, the two heroes shouted and rushed upon them like lions\non a herd of elephants, and encountered them sword in hand. Then the kettle-\ndrums sounded like thunder, and the assembled army of the demons was spread in\nevery direction like clouds; the din of arms was as continued rain; in the\nmidst of which Krishnu and Bulram, whilst fighting, appeared as brilliant and\nbeautiful, as lightning amidst thick clusters of clouds. All the gods were\nsitting in their chariots, and viewing the battle from the sky, they\ncelebrated the praises of Krishnu, and earnestly wished that he might be\nvictorious; and Oogursen and all the descendants of Judoo were extremely\nanxious, and regretted that they had allowed Shree Krishnu and Bulram to go\nforth to the army of demons.\n\nShree Shookdeo, the sage, having proceeded thus far in his narrative, said, O\nlord of the earth! when in the course of the battle a great portion of the\narmy of demons had been destroyed, Buldeo Jee descended from his chariot, and\nbound . Joorasindhoo. Upon this, Shree Krishnu Chund said to him; "Brother!\nlet him live, do not kill him, because he will return and again bring more\ndemons with him; whom we will destroy, and remove the burthens of the world,\nand if we do not spare his life, we shall lose the evil spirits, who have\nfled." In consequence of this expostulation of Krishnu, Buldeo Jee released\nJoorasindhoo, who went off and joined those who had fled from the field.\nLooking around he said with regret, "My whole army has vanished, the greatest\ncalamity has befallen me. Why should I live?" I will abandon my home, and turn\n\np. 195\n\ndevotee." A councillor said to him, expostulating, "Why should a wise man like\nyou regret, sometimes there is defeat, and sometimes victory? No one should\nabandon his government and home: What matters it that you have been defeated\nin this battle, we will collect our forces again, and send Krishnu and Buldeo,\nand all the descendants of Judoo to heaven; banish all anxious thought."\n\nO great king! the councillor having thus expostulated, returned home with\nJoorasindhoo, and all the demons, who had fled from the battle; and there\nbegan to assemble another army. Shree Krishnu and Bulram saw blood flowing in\na stream on the battle-field, in which chariots without their charioteers were\ncarried along like boats; in different places the dead elephants appeared like\nhills, from whose wounds blood spouted forth like springs. There Muhadeo,\naccompanied by goblins and spirits, and wearing a necklace of human heads, was\ndancing and singing in the greatest glee; and female spirits and goblins, and\nthe attendants of Devee were drinking blood out of skulls; vultures, jackalls\nand crows were devouring the bodies, and contending with each other, for the\nflesh.\n\nHaving recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O. great king! the regent\nof the winds collected all the chariots, elephants, horses and demons\ntogether, and fire burnt them to ashes in a second. The five elements were re-\nunited with each other, all saw them come but no one saw where they departed.\nHaving thus put the demons to death, and removed the burthens of the earth,\nShree Krishnu and Bulram, the benefactors of their worshippers, cane to\nOogursen, and, making a salutation, said with joined hands, "O great king!\nthrough your excellence and majesty, we have destroyed and routed the army of\nthe demons, rule now without fear, and promote the happiness of your\nsubjects." The Raja Oogursen was very much pleased at these words, and made\ngreat rejoicings, and began to rule with justice.\n\np. 196\n\nAfter some time, Joorasindhoo came forth to attack with another army as large\nas the former one, which Shree Krishnu and Buldeo destroyed and dispersed as\nbefore. In this manner, Joorasindhoo attacked seventeen times with his twenty-\nthree armies, which Krishnu drove back, after having inflicted great slaughter\non them.\n\nAfter reciting thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said to the\nRaja Pureechit,--O great king! at this time upon a sudden thought Narud Jee\nrose, and went off to the abode of Kaljumun. On seeing him, he stood up with\nall his court, and making a salutation, enquired in a respectful manner, and\nwith joined hands, the reason of his coming. At these words Narud, after a\nlittle thought, said, "[Bulbhudru](errata.htm#8) and Krishnu are at Muttra, no\none, except you, can drive them away, Joorasindhoo has not met with any\nsuccess. "You are immortal and very powerful, Buldeo and Huri are children."\nNarud Jee added, "Do not cease to follow him, "whom you observe of the colour\nof the clouds, with lotus eyes, a very elegant person dressed in yellow silk,\nand with a yellow scarf."\n\nHaving thus spoken, Narud, the sage, departed; and Kaljumun began to prepare\nhis army. After some days, he collected three crores of very unclean men of\nterrifying aspect, with stout arms and thick necks, large teeth, dirty\nappearance, brown hair, red eyes, like small red and black seeds; with whom,\nsounding the kettle-drum, he advanced against the city of Muttra, and\nsurrounded it on all sides. Shree Krishnu Chund, having seen what he had done,\nthought to himself, "It is not right to remain here, because to-day he has\ncome to attack, and to-morrow Joorasindhoo will come; the inhabitants will be\ndistressed; wherefore, it is most advisable, that all should leave this place,\nand go and dwell elsewhere."\n\nO great king! Huri, having thus reflected, sent for Bishookurma, and,\nexplaining to him, said, "Go and build a city in the midst of the sea, in\nwhich all the descendants of Judoo\n\np. 197\n\nmay live comfortably, without knowing that they are not living in their own\nhouses; and convey them all there in a second."\n\nOn hearing these words Bishookurma departed, and, according to the injunction\nof Shree Krishnu Jee, built, during the night, in the sea, on the quoit of\nVishnu, a city, forty-eight coss in extent; and having named it Dwarka,\nreturned and informed Huri, who ordered him to convey all the descendants of\nJudoo there in such a manner, that no one might know, whence they had come,\nand who had brought them. When Krishnu had thus spoken, Bishookurma conveyed\nall the descendants of Judoo, together with Oogursen and Basoodeo to the city\nin the course of the night, and Shree Krishnu and Bulram also went there. In\nthe mean while, on hearing the sound of the waves of the sea, the descendants\nof Judoo awoke; and being greatly astonished began to say to each other,\n"Whence has the sea come to Muttra? We cannot understand this mystery at all."\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in his narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the\nRaja Pureechit,--O lord of the earth! having thus had the descendants of Judoo\nbrought to Dwarka, Shree Krishnu Chund said to Buldeo Jee, "Brother! let us go\nnow, and afford protection to our subjects, and kill Kaljumun." Upon these\nwords, the two brothers went thence to Brujmundul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LII](psa53.htm)\n\n'
