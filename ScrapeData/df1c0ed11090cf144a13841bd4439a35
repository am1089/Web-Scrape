But the king without fear put him on his\nshoulder as before and started toward the monk. And as he walked along, the\ngoblin on his shoulder said to him again: "O King, why do you take such pains\nfor that wretched monk? Have you no sense about this fruitless task? Well,\nafter all, I like your devotion. So, to amuse the weary journey, I will tell\nyou another story. Listen."\n\n\n\nThere is a city called Beautiful, and it deserves the name. There lived a king\nnamed Shudraka, of tremendous power and mighty courage. He was so used to\nvictory that the fire of his courage was kept blazing by the wind from the\nfans in the hands of the wives of his vanquished foes. Under his rule the\nearth was rich and always good, as in the days of old. And he was fond of\nbrave men.\n\nNow one day a Brahman named Hero came from Malwa to pay his homage to this\nking. He had a wife named Virtue, a son named Trusty, and a daughter named\nHeroic. And he had just three servants, a dagger at his hip, a sword in his\nhand, and a shield in his other hand. These were all the servants he had when\nhe asked the king for five hundred gold-pieces a day as his wages.\n\nAnd the king thought from his appearance that he was a remarkably brave man,\nso he gave him the wages he asked. But out of curiosity he put spies on his\ntrack, to learn what he did with all the money.\n\nNow Hero called on the king in the morning, and at noon he took his sword and\nstood at the palace gate and divided his daily salary. One hundred gold-pieces\nhe gave to his wife for food and household expenses. And with another hundred\nhe bought clothes and perfumes and nuts and such things. And another hundred\nhe devoted to the worship of Vishnu and Shiva, after taking the ceremonial\nbath. And the two hundred which were left he gave to Brahmans and the unhappy\nand the poor. This was the way he divided and spent the money every day. Then\nafter he had sacrificed and eaten dinner, he stood every night alone at the\npalace gate with his sword and shield. All this King Shudraka learned from his\nspies and was greatly pleased and forbad the spies to follow him again. For he\nthought him a wonderful man, worthy of especial honour.\n\nThen one day a veil of clouds covered the sky and poured down rain in streams\nday and night, so that the highway was quite deserted. Only Hero was at his\npost as usual by the palace gate. And when the sun set and dreadful darkness\nwas spread abroad and the rain fell in sheets, the king wished to test Hero\'s\nbehaviour. So at night he climbed to the palace roof and cried: "Who is there\nat the gate?" And Hero answered: "I am here." And the king thought: "How\nsteadfast this man Hero is, and how devoted to me! I must surely give him a\ngreater post." And he descended from the roof and entered the palace and went\nto bed.\n\nThe next night it rained again in sheets and the world was wrapped in the\ndarkness of death. And again the king thought to test his behaviour, and\nclimbing to the roof he called out toward the palace gate: "Who is there?" And\nwhen Hero said: "I am here, your Majesty," the king was greatly astonished.\n\nJust then he heard at a distance a sweet-voiced woman crying. And he thought:\n"Who is this who laments so piteously, as if in deep despair? In my kingdom\nthere is no violence, no poor man and none distressed. Who can she be?" And\nbeing merciful, he called to Hero, who stood below: "Listen, Hero. A woman is\nweeping at some distance. Go and learn why she weeps and who she is." And Hero\nsaid "Certainly," arranged his dagger, took his sword in his hand, and\nstarted. He did not even think of the pelting hail, the flashing lightning, or\nthe rain and darkness. And when the king saw him setting out alone in a night\nlike that, he was filled with pity and curiosity, and descending from the\npalace roof, took his sword and followed all alone, without being seen.\n\nAs Hero traced the sound of crying, he came to a beautiful lake outside the\ncity, and there he saw a woman in the midst of the water, lamenting in these\nwords: "Alas for you, brave and merciful and generous! How shall I live\nwithout you?"\n\nAnd Hero was amazed, and timidly asked her: "Who are you, and why do you\nweep?" And she replied: "O Hero, I am the Goddess of the Earth, and now my\nlord, this virtuous King Shudraka, is going to die in three days. How shall I\nfind another such master? So I am distracted with grief, and I lament."\n\nWhen Hero heard this, he was frightened and said: "Goddess, is there any\nremedy for this, any way in which the king might be saved?" And the goddess\nanswered: "There is just one remedy, my son, and it is in your hands." And\nHero said: "Goddess, tell me quickly, that I may adopt it at once. What good\nwould life be to us otherwise?"\n\nThen the goddess said: "My son, there is no other man devoted to his master as\nyou are: so you may learn how to save him. There is a temple to the Dreadful\nGoddess built by that king near his palace. If you sacrifice your son to her\nat once, then the king will not die. He will live another hundred years. If\nyou do it this very night, then the blessing will come, not otherwise."\n\nAnd Hero, the hero, replied: "Then I will go, Goddess, and do it this moment."\nAnd the Goddess of the Earth said: "Good fortune go with you," and she\nvanished. And the king, who had followed secretly, heard it all. So he still\nfollowed to find out how Hero would behave.\n\nBut Hero went straight home, woke his wife Virtue, and told her all that the\nGoddess of the Earth had said. And his wife said: "My dear, if so much depends\non it, wake the boy and tell him." Then Hero woke the little boy, told him\nall, and said: "My boy, if you are sacrificed to the Dreadful Goddess, our\nking will live. If not, he will die in three days."\n\nAnd the boy was true to his name. Without fear and without hesitation he said:\n"My dear father, I am a lucky boy if the king lives at the cost of my life.\nBesides, that would pay for the food we have eaten. Why then delay? Take me\nquickly and sacrifice me to the goddess. May the king\'s evil fate be averted\nby my death!" And Hero was delighted and congratulated him, saying: "Well\nsaid! You are indeed my son."\n\nSo Hero\'s wife Virtue and his daughter Heroic went through the night with Hero\nand Trusty to the temple of the Dreadful Goddess. The king too followed them,\ndisguised and unnoticed. Then the father took Trusty from his shoulder in the\npresence of the goddess. And Trusty worshipped the goddess, and bravely\nsaluted her, and said: "O Goddess, by the sacrifice of my head may the king\nlive another hundred years and rule a thornless kingdom."\n\nAnd as he prayed, Hero cut off his head and offered it to the Dreadful\nGoddess, saying: "May the king live at the cost of my son\'s life!" Then a\nvoice cried from heaven: "O Hero, who else is devoted to his master as you\nare? You have given life and royal power to the king at the cost of your only\nson, and such a son." All this the king himself saw and heard.\n\nThen Hero\'s daughter Heroic kissed the lips of her dead brother, and was\nblinded with sorrow, and her heart broke, and she died.\n\nThen Hero\'s wife Virtue said: "My dear, we have done our duty by the king. And\nyou see how my daughter died of grief. So now I say: What good is life to me\nwithout my children? I was a fool before. I should have given my own head to\nsave the king. So now permit me to burn myself at once."\n\nAnd when she insisted, Hero said: "Do so. What happiness is there in a life of\nconstant mourning for your children? And as for your giving your own life\ninstead, do not grieve about that. If there had been any other way, I should\nof course have given my life. So wait a moment. I will build you a funeral\npile out of these logs." So he built the pile and lighted it.\n\nAnd Virtue fell at her husband\'s feet, then worshipped the Dreadful Goddess,\nand prayed: "O Goddess, may I have the same husband in another life, and may\nthis same King Shudraka be saved at the cost of my son\'s life." And she died\nin the blazing fire.\n\nThen Hero thought: "I have done my duty by the king, as the heavenly voice\nadmitted. And I have paid for the king\'s food which I have eaten. So now why\nshould I want to live alone? It is not right for a man like me to go on living\nat the expense of all the family which I ought to support. Why should I not\nplease the goddess by sacrificing myself?"\n\nSo Hero first approached the goddess with a hymn of praise: "O Demon-slayer!\nSaviour! Devil-killer! Trident-holder! Joy of the wise! Protectress of the\nuniverse! Victory to thee, O best of mothers, whose feet the world adores! O\nfearless refuge of the pious! Kali of the dreadful ornaments! Honour and glory\nto thee, O kindly goddess! Be pleased to accept the sacrifice of my head in\nbehalf of King Shudraka." Then he suddenly cut off his own head with his\ndagger.\n\nKing Shudraka beheld this from his hiding-place, and was filled with amazement\nand grief and admiration. And he thought: "I have never seen or heard the like\nof this. That good man and his family have done a hard thing for me. In this\nstrange world who else is so brave as that, to give his son, his family, and\nhis life for his king: If I should not make a full return for his kindness, my\nkingdom would mean nothing to me, and my life would be the life of a beast. If\nI lost my virtue, it would all be a disgrace to me."\n\nBut when he started to cut off his own head, there came a voice from heaven:\n"My son, do nothing rash. I am well pleased with your character. The Brahman\nHero and his children and his wife shall come back to life." And when the\nvoice ceased, Hero stood up alive and uninjured with his son and his daughter\nand his wife. Then the king hid himself again and looked on with eyes filled\nwith tears of joy, and could not see enough of them.\n\nNow Hero, like a man awaking from a dream, gazed at his son and his wife and\nhis daughter, and was greatly perplexed. He spoke to each by name, and asked\nthem how they had come to life after being reduced to ashes. "Is this a fancy\nof mine? Or a dream? Or an illusion? Or the favour of the goddess?" And his\nwife and children said to him: "By the favour of the goddess we are alive."\n\nAt last Hero believed it, and having worshipped the goddess, he went home\nhappy with his children and his wife. And when he had seen his son and his\nwife and daughter safe at home, he went back that same night to the palace\ngate.\n\nAnd King Shudraka saw all this and went back without being seen himself, and\nclimbed to the roof, and called: "Who is there at the gate?" And Hero replied:\n"Your Majesty, I, Hero, am here. At your command I followed the woman who\ncried. She must have been a witch, for she vanished the moment I saw her and\nspoke to her."\n\nWhen the king heard this, he was astonished beyond measure, for he had seen\nwhat really happened. And he thought: "Ah, the hearts of brave men are deep as\nthe sea, if they do not boast after doing an unparalleled action." So the king\ndescended from the roof, entered the palace, and passed the rest of the night\nthere.\n\nThen when the court was held in the morning, Hero came to see the king. And as\nhe stood there, the delighted king told all his counsellors and the others the\nstory of the night. And all were amazed and confounded at hearing of Hero\'s\nvirtues, and they praised him, crying: "Well done! Well done!"\n\nThen the king and Hero lived happily together, sharing the power equally.\n\n\n\nWhen the goblin had told this story, he asked King Triple-victory: "O King,\nwhich of all these was the most worthy? If you know and will not tell, then\nthe curse I told you of will be fulfilled."\n\nAnd the king said to the goblin: "O magic creature, King Shudraka was the most\nnoble of them all."\n\nBut the goblin said: "Why not Hero, the like of whom as a servant is not to be\nfound in the whole world? Or why should not his wife receive the most praise,\nwho did not waver when she saw her son killed like a beast before her eyes? Or\nwhy is not the boy Trusty the most worthy, who showed such wonderful manhood\nwhen only a little boy? Why do you say that King Shudraka was the best among\nthem?"\n\nThen the king answered the goblin: "Not Hero. He was a gentleman born, so it\nwas his duty to save his king at the cost of life, wife and children. And his\nwife was a lady, a faithful wife who only did what was right in following her\nhusband. And Trusty was their son, and like them. For the cloth is always like\nthe threads. But the king has aright to use his subjects\' lives to save his\nown. So when Shudraka gave his life for them, he proved himself the best of\nall."\n\nWhen the goblin heard this, he jumped from the king\'s shoulder and went back\nto his home without being seen. And the king was not disturbed by this magic,\nbut started back through the night to catch him.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fifth Goblin: The Brave Man, the Wise Man, and the Clever Man.
