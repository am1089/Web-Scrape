They shall pour hot spirituous liquor into the mouth of a Brahma _n_ a who\nhas drunk such liquor; he will be purified after death. 1\n\n2\\. If he has drunk it unintentionally, (he shall drink) for three days hot\nmilk, clarified butter, and water, and (inhale hot) air. That (penance is\ncalled the Tapta-)k _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra. Afterwards he shall be again initiated.\n2\n\n3\\. And (the same penance must be performed) for swallowing urine, excrements,\nor semen,\n\np. 288\n\n4\\. And (for eating) any part of a carnivorous beast, of a camel or of an ass,\n4\n\n5\\. And of tame cocks or tame pigs.\n\n6\\. If he smells the fume (exhaled) by a man who has drunk spirituous liquor,\n(he shall) thrice restrain his breath and eat clarified butter, 6\n\n7\\. Also, if he has been bitten by (one of the animals mentioned) above\n(Sutras 4-5). 7\n\n8\\. He who has defiled the bed of his Guru shall extend himself on a heated\niron bed, 8\n\n9\\. Or he shall embrace the red-hot iron image of a woman.\n\n10\\. Or he shall tear out his organ and testicles and, holding them in his\nhands, walk straight towards the south-west, until he falls down dead,\n\n11\\. He will be purified after death.\n\n12\\. (The guilt of him who has intercourse) with the wife of a friend, a\nsister, a female belonging to the same family, the wife of a pupil, a\ndaughter-in-law, or with a cow, is as great as that of (him who violates his\nGuru's) bed. 12\n\n13\\. Some (declare, that the guilt of such a sinner is equal to) that of a\nstudent who breaks the vow of chastity. 13\n\n14\\. A woman who commits adultery with a man 14\n\np. 289\n\nof lower caste the king shall cause to be devoured by dogs in a public place.\n\n15\\. He shall cause the adulterer to be killed (also). 15\n\n16\\. (Or he shall punish him in the manner) which has been declared (above).\n16\n\n17\\. A student who has broken the vow of chastity shall offer an ass to Nir\n_ri_ ti on a cross-road. 17\n\n18\\. Putting on the skin of that (ass), with the hair turned outside, and\nholding a red (earthen) vessel in his hands, he shall beg in seven houses,\nproclaiming his deed.\n\n19\\. He will be purified after a year.\n\n20\\. For an involuntary discharge caused by fear or sickness, or happening\nduring sleep, and if for seven days the fire-oblations and begging have been\nneglected, (a student) shall make an offering of clarified 20\n\np. 290\n\nbutter or (place) two pieces of fuel (in the fire) reciting the two (verses\ncalled) Retasya.\n\n21\\. Let him who was asleep when the sun rose remain standing during the day,\ncontinent and fasting, and him who was asleep when the sun set (remain in the\nsame position) during the night, reciting the Gayatri. 21\n\n22\\. He who has looked at an impure (person), shall look at the sun and\nrestrain his breath (once). 22\n\n23\\. Let him who has eaten forbidden food [or swallowed impure substances],\n(fast until) his entrails are empty. 23\n\n24\\. (In order to attain that), he must entirely abstain from food at least\nfor three (days and) nights.\n\n25\\. Or (he becomes pure) after eating during seven (days and) nights fruits\nthat have become detached spontaneously, avoiding (all other food).\n\n26\\. (If, he has eaten forbidden food mentioned above) before five-toed\nanimals, he must throw it up and eat clarified butter. 26\n\n27\\. For abuse, speaking an untruth, and doing injury, (he shall practise)\nausterities for no longer period than three (days and) nights. 27\n\np. 291\n\n28\\. If (the abuse) was merited, (he shall offer) burnt-oblations, reciting\n(the Mantras) addressed to Varu _n_ a and (the hymns) revealed by Manu. 28\n\n29\\. Some (declare, that) an untruth (spoken) at the time of marriage, during\ndalliance, in jest or while (one suffers severe) pain is venial. 29\n\n30\\. But (that is) certainly not (the case) when (the untruth) concerns a\nGuru.\n\n31\\. For if he lies in his heart only to a Guru regarding small matters even,\nhe destroys (himself), seven descendants, and seven ancestors.\n\n32\\. For intercourse with a female (of one) of the lowest castes, he shall\nperform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance during one year. 32\n\n33\\. (For committing the same sin) undesignedly, (he shall perform the same\npenance) during twelve (days and) nights.\n\n34\\. For connection with a woman during her courses, (he shall perform the\nsame penance) for three (days and) nights. 34\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[287:1](sbe0287.htm#fr_1421) **XXIII**. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 3. Haradatta,\nremarks that other twice-born men also must perform the same penance in case\nthey drink liquor forbidden to them, see above, II, 20 note. He also states\nthat the offence must have been committed intentionally and repeatedly in\norder to justify so severe an expiation. Regarding the effect of the\npurification after death, see above, XX, 16.\n\n[287:2](sbe0287.htm#fr_1422)-3. Manu XI, 151; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 255; see\nalso \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 10.\n\n[288:4](sbe0287.htm#fr_1423)-5. Manu XI, 157.\n\n[288:6](sbe0287.htm#fr_1424) Manu XI, 150.\n\n[288:7](sbe0287.htm#fr_1425) Manu XI, 200; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 277.\n\n[288:8](sbe0287.htm#fr_1426)-10. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 1-2. Haradatta asserts\nthat Guru denotes here the father alone.\n\n[288:12](sbe0287.htm#fr_1427) Manu XI, 171-172; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III,\n232-233.\n\n[288:13](sbe0287.htm#fr_1428) 'The penance also consists in the performance of\nthe rites obligatory on an unchaste student (see Sutras 17-19), and that for\nthe violation of a Guru's bed need not be performed.'--Haradatta.\n\n[288:14](sbe0287.htm#fr_1429) Manu VIII, 371.\n\n[289:15](sbe0287.htm#fr_1430) Manu VIII, 372; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 286;\n\xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 27, 9. My best MSS. read ghatayet, 'shall cause to be\nkilled,' instead of Professor Stenzler's khadayet, 'shall cause to be\ndevoured.' C. has khadayet, but its commentary, as well as that given in the\nother MSS., shows that ghatayet is the correct reading. The text of the\ncommentary runs as follows: Anantaroktavishaye gata _h_ puman ra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\nghatayitvyo [khadayitavyo C.] vadhaprakara _s_ _k_ anantaram eva vasish _th_\nava _k_ ane dar _s_ ita _h_. The passages of Vasish _th_ a XXI, 1-3, which\nHaradatta has quoted in explanation of Sutra 14, prescribe that the adulterer\nis to be burnt. Another objection to the reading khadayet is that the word\nwould be superfluous. If Gautama had intended to prescribe the same punishment\nfor the adulterer as for the woman, he would simply have said puma _m_ sam.\n\n[289:16](sbe0287.htm#fr_1431) Above, i.e. XII, 2, where the mutilation of the\noffender has been prescribed. See also \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 26, 20.\n\n[289:17](sbe0287.htm#fr_1432)-19. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 2 6, 8-9.\n\n[289:20](sbe0287.htm#fr_1433) Manu II, 181, 187; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 278,\n281. The Retasyas are found Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka I, 30.\n\n[290:21](sbe0287.htm#fr_1434) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5,12, 22; Manu II, 220.\n\n[290:22](sbe0287.htm#fr_1435) Manu V, 86. 'An impure person, i.e. a _K_ a _n_\n_d_ ala and the like. This rule refers to a student (who sees such a person)\nwhile he recites the Veda.'--Haradatta.\n\n[290:23](sbe0287.htm#fr_1436)-24. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 27, 3-4. My copies omit\namedhyapra _s_ ane va, or has swallowed impure substances, and the words are\nnot required, as another penance has been prescribed for the case above, Sutra\n3. But see also Samavidhana I, 5, 13.\n\n[290:26](sbe0287.htm#fr_1437) Manu XI, 161. The Sutras referred to are XVII,\n9-26.\n\n[290:27](sbe0287.htm#fr_1438) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 26, 3. My copies read\ntriratraparamam instead of triratram paramam. This reading, which seems\npreferable, p. 291 is also confirmed by the commentary, where the words are\nexplained, triratraparataya pare _n_ a triratram.\n\n[291:28](sbe0287.htm#fr_1439) According to Haradatta the texts addressed to\nVaru _n_ a are yatki _m_ _k_ edam, Taitt. Sa _m_ h. III, 4, 11, 6; imam me\nvaru _n_ a, tattva yami, Taitt. Sa _m_ h. II, i, 11, 6; and ava te he _l_ o,\nTaitt. Sa _m_ h. I, 5, 11, 3. The hymns seen by Manu are Rig-veda VIII, 27-31.\n\n[291:29](sbe0287.htm#fr_1440) Manu VII, 112.\n\n[291:32](sbe0287.htm#fr_1441) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 10, 28, 10-11. Regarding the K _ri_\n_k_ _kh_ ra penance, see below, chapter XXVI.\n\n[291:34](sbe0287.htm#fr_1442) Manu XI, 174; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 288.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXIV](sbe0288.htm)\n\n"
