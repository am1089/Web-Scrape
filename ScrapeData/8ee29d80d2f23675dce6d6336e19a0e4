If it be said that (texts such as the one about the udgitha are) mere\nglorification, on account of their reference (to parts of sacrifices); we deny\nthat, on account of the newness (of what they teach, if viewed as\ninjunctions).\n\n'That udgitha is the best of all essences, the highest, holding the highest\nplace, the eighth' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 1, 3); 'This earth is the _Ri_ _k_ , the\nfire is Saman' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 6, 1); 'This world in truth is that piled-up\nfire-altar' ( _S_ at. Bra. X, I, 2, 2); 'That hymn is truly that earth' (Ait.\n\xc3\x82r. II, 1, 2, 1); with reference to these and other similar passages a doubt\narises whether they are meant to glorify the udgitha and so on, or to enjoin\ndevout meditations.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that their aim is glorification, because the text\nexhibits them with reference to subordinate members of sacrificial actions,\nsuch as the udgitha and so on. They are, he says, analogous to passages such\nas 'This earth is the ladle;' 'the sun is the tortoise;' 'the heavenly world\nis the \xc3\x82havaniya,' whose\n\np. 304\n\naim it is to glorify the ladle and so on. To this the Sutrakara replies as\nfollows. We have no right to consider the purpose of those passages to be mere\nglorification, on account of the newness. If they aim at injunction, a new\nmatter is enjoined by them; if, on the other hand, they aimed at glorification\nthey would be devoid of meaning. For, as explained in the Pu. Mim. Su.,\nglorificatory passages are of use in so far as entering into a complementary\nrelation to injunctive passages; but the passages under discussion are\nincapable of entering into such a relation to the udgitha and so on which are\nenjoined in altogether different places of the Veda, and would therefore be\npurposeless as far as glorification is concerned. Passages such as 'This earth\nis the ladle' are not analogous because they stand in proximity to injunctive\npassages.--Therefore texts such as those under discussion have an injunctive\npurpose.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 22](sbe38231.htm)\n\n"
