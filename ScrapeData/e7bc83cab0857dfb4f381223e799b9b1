Janamejaya said :-- O Vasaveya! the Chief amongst the Munis, the Ocean of\nall knowledge, O the Sinless One! the Lord and Well Wisher of our families, I\ncome to you with a mind to ask you certain questions.\n\n\n\n* Vasavi is the name of the mother of Vyasa.\n\n\n\n2-3. I heard of yore, but I do not know why was that illustrious son of\nSurasena, that powerful \xc3\x82nakadundubhi (1), the pious and illustrious Vasudeva,\nthe father of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the incarnation of the God Hari Himself, and\nwho was worshipped even by the Gods, thrown into prison by Kamsa?\n\n\n\nNote :-- (1) \xc3\x82nakadundubhi is the epithet of Vasudeva, father of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_\na, since at Vasudeva's birth, drums called \xc3\x82nakas and Dundubhis were resounded\nin the sky.\n\n\n\n4-5. What faults had he and his wife Devaki committed? Why that Kamsa the\ndescendant of Yayati, killed the six infant sons of Devaki? And for what\nreason did the God S\xc2\x92ri Hari incarnate Himself as the son of Vasudeva in the\nprison house of Kamsa?\n\n\n\n6-11. How was that Lord of the Universe, S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan, and the Ruler of the\nYadava clan, taken to Gokula? Why was He, born of a K _s_ attriya family,\ngenerally recognised as of the Gopala (cow-herd) clan? Why were His father\nVasudeva and mother Devaki thrown into prison? And why did not S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_\na, of indomitable prowess, and capable to create and preserve the worlds,\ncould release instantly, father and mother from their imprisoned state? I\ncannot conceive that the so-called Fate could have any influence on such high\nsouled persons, the father and mother of the Supreme Being, S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a;\nwho were those sons of Vasudeva that were killed by Kamsa? And who was that\ngirl child who when struck by Kamsa on a slab of stone instantly rose up above\nthe sky, assuming the form of A _st_ abhuja, the eight armed Goddess? O\nSinless One! Kindly explain unto me how did S\xc2\x92ri Hari manage to perform the\nhouse-holder's duties, when he had married the several wives? and what were\nthose glorious deeds that he did in His this incarnation and how did he\nfinally pass away from his mortal physical coil? My mind sinks into an ocean\nof confusion, when I hear of the several things done by S\xc2\x92ri Hari; some times\nI find the deeds, not capable of being done by any other than the Supreme\nBeing Himself and sometimes I hear of deeds that can be done by an ordinary\nman. And, therefore I cannot decide whether Vasudeva was the Incarnation of\nGod or an ordinary being. Be pleased to remove these doubts from my mind and\ndescribe the life of Vasudeva in its true light.\n\n\n\np. 250\n\n\n\n12-14. In days of yore, the two sons of Dharma were the two best amongst the\nRi _s_ is, and were the Devas Nara and Naraya _n_ a. They were very high\nsouled persons and they performed severe austerities for long extending years.\nThey were born as part incarnations of Vi _sn_ u; and, for the good of the\nworld, did they, in the Vadarika'srama, perform penances, controlling their\nsix passions, and free from desires.\n\n\n\n15\\. The all-knowing sages Narada and others say that the well known Arjuna\nand S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a of indomitable prowess were the two part incarnations of\nthose two ancient Munis Nara and Naraya _n_ a.\n\n\n\n16\\. How came those two Devas Nara and Naraya _n_ a to be born in the two\nbodies of Kri _sn_ a and Arju _n_ a, though they did not relinquish their\nprevious bodies!\n\n\n\n17\\. And also when those two Munis had attained liberation, their goal in\ntheir Yogas, by performing severe penances, how could they again be born in\nother bodies!\n\n\n\n18-19. If any S'udra dies performing his own religion, he takes up a Vais\xc2\x92ya\nbody in his next incarnation; if any Vais'ya died so, he takes up a K _s_\nattriya body and a K _s_ attriya when adhering to his own rites and\nceremonies, dying takes up a Brahma _n_ body in his next incarnation. And if a\nBrahmi _n_ be free from desires and resorts to the path of peace, when he\ndies, he becomes free from incarnations and is saved from this disease of\ngetting into the world.\n\n\n\n20-21. Now the reverse seems to take place in the case of Nara and Naraya _n_\na. In spite of withering up their bodies by hard penances, they took up K _s_\nattriya bodies. Under what influence of Karma, did they take up up birth when\nthey were Yogis? Or might they, the Brahmi _n_ s, become K _s_ attriyas owing\nto some curse? Whatever it may be, kindly remove my doubts, explaining to me\ntheir causes.\n\n\n\n22\\. It is heard that the Yadava clan suffered destruction through the curse\nof a Brahma _n_ and in spite of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a being the incarnation of the\nSupreme Being, his family died of the effect of curse from Gandhari.\n\n\n\n23\\. How was it that Pradyumna was stolen away by S'ambara, the lord of the\nAsuras; and for what purpose when Vasudeva, the Deva of the Devas was present,\nhow was it that his son was stolen away from the lying-in room? This seems\nimpossible.\n\n\n\n24\\. Why did not Vasudeva see, with His inner vision, the stealing away of his\nson from the impregnable walls of His fortress-like mansion in Dwarka? (And\ncould thus have prevented this!)\n\n\n\np. 251\n\n\n\n25-39. O Muni! After Vasudeva had gone to Heaven, his wives were plundered by\nthe dacoits on the way. I am very much in doubt on this point. Also I cannot\nunderstand why did this event take place just after His translation to Heaven?\nAgain how was S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, who was Vi _sn_ u's Full incarnation, born into\nthis world to take off the vicious load of this earth, and to destroy the\nevil-doers, terrified and He fled through the fear of Jarasandha, evacuated\nHis kingdom of Mathura and went with His armies and friends to Dwarka?\nVasudeva came here to destroy the evil miscreants and to conserve the\nreligion; how then did He not, as He was all knowing, previously kill those\ndacoits, who afterward stole and plundered His wives? Was it, that He, being\nOmniscient did not know those dacoits? He protected the Pa _nd_ avas, no\ndoubt, who were high souled, righteous and virtuous; but I cannot understand\nhow did He consider the high souled virtuous persons like Bhi _s_ ma, Dro _n_\na and others as loads of earth and slay them. The devotees of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a,\nobserving good customs, conducts and practices, Yudhi _st_ hira and his\nbrothers performed the Rajasuya sacrifice, according to rules, giving various\nofferings to the Brahmi _n_ s and depended entirely on Vasudeva; still, O\nMuni! they suffered terrible hardships; whither were their virtuous deeds by\nthis time? what horrible sins did they commit that they had to suffer pains\nand troubles in the assembly. The highly merited Draupadi arose from the midst\nof sacrificial fire and is born of the part of Lak _s_ mi, pure and devoted to\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. How did such a glorious woman meet with incomparable terrible\npains often and often; how could she be caught hold of by her hair on her head\nby Duh'sasan; and carried to the royal assembly, when she was in her menses\nand extremely terrified and harassed? How did she come to be a slave of Matsya\nRaj in his kingdom Vira _t_ , and though actually crying aloud like a female\nosprey (eagle) she was highly insulted by Kichaka! Alas! how could Draupadi be\nstolen away by Jayadratha, though latterly released by the Pa _nd_ avas? What\nevil deeds did the Pa _nd_ avas commit in their previous births, that they had\nto befall under so many telling difficulties?\n\n\n\n40\\. O high minded Muni! My ancestors performed the Rajasuya sacrifice and\nstill they fell under so many serious difficulties. Kindly explain the causes\nof these to me.\n\n\n\n41-42. If it be urged, that they suffered so many serious calamities, due to\ntheir actions in their former lives, that seems impossible. Because they are\nborn of the Devas; thus arises my doubt; be pleased to explain to me.\n\n\n\nAgain how the Pa _nd_ avas, the sons of Kunti, of good conduct, and knowing\nthe illusory nature of the world, why did they, out of pretence kill Bhi _s_\nma, Drona and others?\n\n\n\np. 252\n\n\n\n43\\. This appears a riddle to me that these Pa _nd_ avas were led to the\nextermination of their race, being inspired by Hari Vasudeva, to this horrible\nact.\n\n\n\n44\\. Rather to live on begging alms and to live on rice, growing wild or\nwithout cultivation, or to live as an artisan or artist than to kill the\nvaliant warriors unlawfully in a battle, simply out of voluptuous greed.\n\n\n\n45\\. O Best of the Munis! You have preserved this extirpated race by producing\nthe Goloka sons (i. e. sons born by other persons of women after their\nhusbands are dead) of indomitable prowess.\n\n\n\n46\\. And why did my honoured father, born of Uttara in this respected family ,\nencircle a snake round the neck of a Brahmi _n_ ascetic?\n\n\n\nNo body, born of a K _s_ attriya family, shews signs of hatred and jealousy\ntowards a Brahmi _n_. Is it that my father shewed such feeling to that\nascetic, who took the vow of silence!\n\n\n\nO Best of the Munis -- These things and lots of others are troubling my mind\nwith many grave doubts. O merciful saint! You know every thing; be kind enough\nto quell this the disturbed state of my mind.\n\n\n\nThus ends the First Adhyaya in the Fourth Book of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavata Pura\n_n_ a of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 2](bk04ch02.htm)\n\n"
