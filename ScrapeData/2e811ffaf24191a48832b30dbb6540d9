They must\npass twelve years in exile, and then they must remain a year in concealment.\nIf they were discovered within this last year, they must go into exile for\nanother twelve years. Having passed the twelve years of exile in forests, the\nPandav brothers disguised themselves and entered into the menial service of\nVirata, king of the Matsyas, to pass the year of concealment. Yudhishthir\npresented himself as a Brahman, skilled in dice, and became a courtier of the\nking. Bhima entered the king\'s service as cook. For Arjun, who was so well\nknown, a stricter concealment was necessary. He wore conch bangles and\nearrings and braided his hair, like those unfortunate beings whom nature has\ndebarred from the privileges of men and women, and he lived in the inner\napartments of the king. He assumed the name of _Brihannala_ , and taught the\ninmates of the royal household in music and dancing. Nakula became a keeper of\nthe king\'s horses, and Sahadeva took charge of the king\'s cows. Draupadi too\ndisguised herself as a waiting-woman, and served the princess of the Matsya\nhouse in that humble capacity.\n\nIn these disguises the Pandav brothers safely passed a year in concealment in\nspite of all search which Duryodhan made after them. At last an incident\nhappened which led to their discovery when the year was out.\n\nCattle-lifting was a common practice with the kings of ancient India, as with\nthe chiefs of ancient Greece. The king of the Trigartas and the king of the\nKurus combined and fell on the king of the Matsyas in order to drive off the\nnumerous herd of fine cattle for which his kingdom was famed. The Trigartas\nentered the Matsya kingdom from the south-east, and while Virata went out with\nhis troops to meet the foe, Duryodhan with his Kuru forces fell on the kingdom\nfrom the north.\n\nWhen news came that the Kurus had invaded the kingdom, there was no army in\nthe capital to defend it. King Virata had gone out with most of his troops to\nface the Trigartas in the south-east, and the prince Uttara had no inclination\nto face the Kurus in the north. The disguised Arjun now came to the rescue in\nthe manner described in this Book. The description of the bows. arrows, and\nswords of the Pandav brothers which they had concealed in a tree, wrapped like\nhuman corpses to frighten away inquisitive travellers, throws some light on\nthe arts and manufacture of ancient times. The portions translated in this\nBook form Sections xxxv., xxxvi., xl. to xliii., a portion of Section xliv.,\nand Sections liii. and lxxii. of Book iv. of the original text.\n\n## I\n\n## COMPLAINT OF THE COWHERD\n\nMonarch of the mighty Matsyas, brave Virata known to fame,  \nMarched against Trigarta chieftains who from southward regions came,\n\nFrom the north the proud Duryodhan, stealing onwards day by day,  \nSwooped on Matsya\'s fattened cattle like the hawk upon its prey!\n\nBhishma, Drona, peerless Karna, led the Kuru warriors brave,  \nSwept the kingdom of Virata like the ocean\'s surging wave,\n\nFell upon the trembling cowherds, chased them from the pasture-field,  \nSixty thousand head of cattle was the Matsya country\'s yield!\n\nAnd the wailing chief of cowherds fled forlorn, fatigued and spent,  \nSpeeding on his rapid chariot to the royal city went,\n\nCame inside the city portals, came within the palace gate,  \nStruck his forehead in his anguish and bewailed his luckless fate.\n\nMeeting there the prince Uttara, youth of beauty and of fame,  \nTold him of the Kurus\' outrage and lamented Matsya\'s shame:\n\nSixty thousand head of cattle, bred of Matsya\'s finest breed,  \nTo Hastina\'s distant empire do the Kuru chieftains lead,\n\nGlory of the Matsya nation! save thy father\'s valued kine,  \nQuick thy footsteps, strong thy valour, vengeance deep and dire be thine!\n\n\'Gainst the fierce Trigarta chieftains Matsya\'s warlike king is gone,  \nThee we count our lord and saviour as our monarch\'s gallant son,\n\nRise, Uttara! beat the Kurus, homeward lead the stolen kine,  \nLike an elephant of jungle, pierce the Kurus\' shattered line!\n\nAs the Vina speaketh music, by musicians tuned aright,  \nLet thy sounding bow and arrows speak thy deeds of matchless might,\n\nHarness quick thy milk-white coursers to thy sounding battle-car,  \nHoist thy golden lion-banner, speed thee, prince, unto the war!\n\nAnd as thunder-wielding INDRA smote _Asuras_ fierce and bold,  \nSmite the Kurus with thy arrows winged with plumes of yellow gold\n\nAs the famed and warlike Arjun is the stay of Kuru\'s race,  \nThou art refuge of the Matsyas and thy kingdom\'s pride and grace!"\n\nBut the prince went not to battle from the foe to guard the State,  \nTo the cowherd answered gaily, sheltered by the palace gate:\n\n"Not unknown to me the usage of the bow and winged dart,  \nNot unknown the warrior\'s duty or the warrior\'s noble art,\n\nI would win my father\'s cattle from the wily foeman\'s greed,  \nIf a skilful chariot-driver could my fiery coursers lead.\n\nFor my ancient chariot-driver died on battle\'s gory plain,  \nEight and twenty days we wrestled, many warlike chiefs were slain,\n\nBring me forth a skilful driver who can urge the battle-steed,  \nI will hoist my lion-banner, to the dubious battle speed.\n\nDashing through the foeman\'s horses, ranks of elephant and car,  \nI will win the stolen cattle rescued in the field of war,\n\nAnd like thunder-wielding INDRA, smiting Danu\'s sons of old,  \nI will smite the Kuru chieftains, drive them to their distant hold!\n\nBhishma and the proud Duryodhan, archer Karna known to fame,  \nDrona too shall quail before me and retreat in bitter shame,\n\nFor those warriors in my absence Matsya\'s far-famed cattle steal,  \nBut beneath my countless arrows Matsya\'s vengeance they shall feel,\n\nBring me forth a chariot-driver, let me speed my battle-car,  \nAnd in wonder they will question-Is this Arjun famed in war?\n\n## II\n\n## THE DISGUISED CHARIOTEER\n\nArjun, guised as Brihannala, heard the boast Uttara made,  \nAnd to try his skill and valour thus to fair Draupadi prayed:\n\n"Say to him that Brihannala will his battle-chariot lead,  \nThat as Arjun\'s chariot-driver he hath learned to urge the steed,\n\nSay that faithful Brihannala many a dubious war hath seen,  \nAnd will win his father\'s cattle in this contest fierce and keen."\n\nFair Draupadi, guised as menial, Arjun\'s secret best obeyed,  \nHumbly stepped before Uttara and in gentle accents prayed:\n\n"Hear me, prince, yon Brihannala will thy battle-chariot lead,  \nHe was Arjun\'s chariot-driver, skilled to urge the flying steed,\n\nTrained in war by mighty Arjun, trained to drive the battle-car,  \nHe hath followed helmed Arjun in the glorious field of war,\n\nAnd when Arjun conquered Khandav, this, Uttara, I have seen,  \nBrihannala drove his chariot, for I served Yudhishthir\'s queen."\n\nHeard Uttara hesitating, spake his faint and timid mind,  \n"I would trust thee, beauteous maiden, lotus-bosomed, ever kind,\n\nBut a poor and sexless creature, can he rein the warlike steed,  \nCan I ask him, worse than woman, in the battle\'s ranks to lead?\n\n"Need is none," Draupadi answered, "Brihannala\'s grace to ask,  \nHe is eager like the war-horse for this great and warlike task,\n\nAnd he waits upon thy sister, she will bid the minion speed,  \nAnd he wins thy father\'s cattle, and the victor\'s glorious meed!"\n\nMatsya\'s princess spake to Arjun, Arjun led the battle-car,  \nLed the doubting prince Uttara to the dread and dubious war.\n\n## III\n\n## ARMS AND WEAPONS\n\nArjun drove the prince of Matsya to a darksome _sami_ tree,  \nSpake unto the timid warrior in his accents bold and free:\n\nPrince, thy bow and shining arrows, pretty handsome toys are these,  \nScarcely they beseem a warrior, and a warrior cannot please,\n\nThou shalt find upon this _sami_ , mark my words which never fail,  \nStately bows and winged arrows, banners, swords and coats of mail,\n\nAnd a bow which strongest warriors scarce can in the battle bend,  \nAnd the limits of a kingdom widen when that bow is strained,\n\nTall and slender like a palm-tree, worthy of a warrior bold,  \nSmooth the wood of hardened fibre, and the ends are yellow gold!"\n\nDoubting still Uttara answered: "In this _sami\'s_ gloomy shade  \nCorpses hang since many seasons in their wrappings duly laid,\n\nNow I mark them all suspended, horrent, in the open air,  \nAnd to touch the unclean objects, friend, is more than I can dare!"\n\n"Fear not warrior," Arjun answered, "for the tree conceals no dead,  \nWarriors\' weapons, cased like corpses, lurk within its gloomy shade,\n\nAnd I ask thee, prince of Matsya, not to touch an unclean thing,  \nBut unto a chief and warrior weapons and his arms to bring."\n\nPrince Uttara gently lighted, climbed the dark and leafy tree,  \nArjun from the prince\'s chariot bade him speed the arms to free,\n\nAnd the young prince cut the wrappings; lo! the shining bows appear  \nTwisted, voiced like hissing serpents, like the bright stars glistening clear!\n\nSeized with wonder prince Uttara silently the weapons eyed,  \nAnd unto his chariot-driver thus in trembling accents cried:\n\n"Whose this bow so tall and stately, speak to me my gentle friend,  \nOn the wood are golden bosses, tipped with gold is either end,\n\nWhose this second ponderous weapon stout and massive in the hold,  \nOn the staff are worked by artists elephants of burnished gold,\n\nAnd what great and mighty monarch owns this other bow of might,  \nSet with golden glittering insects on its ebon back so bright,\n\nGolden suns of wondrous brightness on this fourth their lustre lend,  \nWho may be the unknown archer who this stately bow can bend,\n\nAnd the fifth is set with jewels, gems and stones of purest ray,  \nGolden fire-flies glint and sparkle in the yellow light of day!\n\nWho doth own these shining arrows with their heads in gold encased  \nThousand arrows bright and feathered in the golden quivers placed:\n\nNext are these with vulture-feather, golden-yellow in their hue,  \nMade of iron keen and whetted, whose may be these arrows true,\n\nNext upon this sable quiver jungle tigers gleam in gold,  \nAnd these keen and boar-eared arrows speak some chieftains fierce and bold,\n\nFourth are these seven hundred arrows, crescent in their shining blade,  \nThirsting for the blood of foemen and by cunning artists made,\n\nAnd the fifth are golden-crested, made of tempered steel and bright,  \nParrot feathers wing these arrows whetted and of wondrous might!\n\nHark again this wondrous sabre, shape of toad is on the hilt,  \nOn the blade a toad is given and the scabbard nobly gilt,\n\nLarger, stouter is this second in its sheath of tiger-skin,  \nDecked with bells and gold-surmounted and the blade is bright and keen,\n\nNext this scimitar so curious by the skilled _Nishadas_ made,  \nScabbard made of wondrous cowhide sheathes the bright and polished blade,\n\nFourth, a long and beauteous weapon glittering sable in its hue,  \nWith its sheath of softer goat-skin worked with gold on azure blue,\n\nAnd the fifth is broad and massive over thirty fingers long,  \nGolden-sheathed and gold embossed like a snake or fiery tongue!\n\nJoyously responded Arjun: "Mark this bow embossed with gold.  \n\'Tis the wondrous bow, _Gandiva_ , worthy of a warrior bold,\n\nGift of heaven! to archer Arjun kindly gods this weapon sent,  \nAnd the confines of a kingdom widen when the bow is bent,\n\nNext, this mighty ponderous weapon worked with elephants of gold,  \nWith this bow the stalwart Bhima hath the tide of conquests rolled,\n\nAnd the third with golden insects by a cunning hand inlaid,  \n\'Tis Yudhishthir\'s royal weapon by the noblest artists made,\n\nNext the bow with solar lustre brave Nakula wields in fight,  \nAnd the fifth is Sahadeva\'s, decked with gems and jewels bright\n\nMark again these thousand arrows, unto Arjun they belong,  \nAnd the darts whose blades are crescent unto Bhima brave and strong,\n\nBoar-ear shafts are young Nakula\'s, in the tiger-quiver eased,  \nSahadeva owns the arrows with the parrots feather graced,\n\nThese three-knotted shining arrows, thick and yellow vulture-plumed.  \nThey belong to King Yudhishthir, with their heads by gold illumed!\n\nListen more, if of these sabres, prince of Matsya, thou wouldst know,  \nArjun\'s sword is toad-engraven, ever dreaded by the foe,\n\nAnd the sword in tiger-scabbard, massive and of mighty strength,  \nNone save tiger-waisted Bhima wields that sword of wondrous length,\n\nNext the sabre golden-hilted, sable and with gold embossed,  \nBrave Yudhishthir kept that sabre when the king his kingdom lost,\n\nYonder sword with goat-skin scabbard brave Nakula wields in war,  \nIn the cowhide Sahadeva keeps his shining scimitar!"\n\n"Strange thy accents," spake Uttara, "stranger are the weapons bright,  \nAre they arms of sons of Pandu famed on earth for matchless might,\n\nWhere are now those pious princes by a dire misfortune crossed,  \nWarlike Arjun, good Yudhishthir, by his subjects loved and lost,\n\nWhere is tiger-waisted Bhima, matchless fighter in the field,  \nAnd the brave and twin-born brothers skilled the arms of war to wield?\n\nO\'er a game they lost their empire and we heard of them no more,  \nOr perchance they lonesome wander on some wild and distant shore,\n\nAnd Draupadi noble princess, purest best of womankind,  \nDoth she wander with Yudhishthir, changeless in her heart and mind?"\n\nProudly answered valiant Arjun, and a smile was on his face,  \nNot in distant lands the brothers do their wandering footsteps trace,\n\nIn thy father\'s court disguised lives Yudhishthir just and good,  \nBhima in thy father\'s palace as a cook prepares the food,\n\nBrave Nakula guards the horses, Sahadeva tends the kine,  \nAs thy sister\'s waiting-woman doth the fair Draupadi shine,\n\n_\n\nPardon, prince, these rings and bangles, pardon strange unmanly guise,  \n\'Tis no poor and sexless creature,--Arjun greets thy wondering eyes!"\n\n_\n\n## IV\n\n## RESCUE OF THE CATTLE\n\nArjun decked his mighty stature in the gleaming arms of war,  \nAnd with voice of distant thunder rolled the mighty battle-car,\n\nAnd the Kurus marked with wonder Arjun\'s standard lifted proud.  \nHeard with dread the deep _Gandiva_ sounding oft and sounding loud,\n\nAnd they knew the wondrous bowman, wheeling round the battle-car,  \nAnd with doubts and grave misgivings whispered Drona skilled in war:\n\n"That is Arjun\'s monkey-standard, how it greets my ancient eyes,  \nWell the Kurus know the standard like a comet in the skies,\n\nHear ye not the deep _Gandiva_? How my ear its accents greet,  \nMark ye not these pointed arrows falling prone before my feet,\n\nBy these darts his salutation to his teacher loved of old,  \nYears of exile now completed, Arjun sends with greetings bold!\n\nHow the gallant prince advances! Now I mark his form and face,  \nIssuing from his dark concealment with a brighter, haughtier grace,\n\nWell I know his bow and arrows and I know his standard well,  \nAnd the deep and echoing accents of his fax-resounding shell,\n\nIn his shining arms accoutred, gleaming in his helmet dread,  \nShines he like the flame of _homa_ by libations duly fed!"\n\nArjun marked the Kuru warriors arming for th\' impending war,  \nWhispered thus to prince Uttara as he drove the battle-car:\n\n"Stop thy steeds, O prince of Matsya! for too close we may not go,  \nStop thy chariot whence, my arrows reach and slay the distant foe,\n\nSeek we out the Kuru monarch, proud Duryodhan let us meet,  \nIf he falls we win the battle, other chieftains will retreat.\n\nThere is Drona my preceptor, Drona\'s warlike son is there,  \nKripa and the mighty Bhishma, archer Karna, tall and fair,\n\nThem I seek not in this battle, lead, O lead thy chariot far,  \nMidst the chiefs Duryodhan moves not, moves not in the ranks of war,\n\nBut to save the pilfered cattle speeds he onward in his fear,  \nWhile these warriors stay and tarry to defend their monarch\'s rear,\n\nBut I leave these car-borne warriors, other work to-day is mine,  \nMeet Duryodhan in the battle, win thy father\'s stolen kine!"\n\nMatsya\'s prince then turned the courses, left behind the war\'s array,  \nWhere Duryodhan with the cattle quickly held his onward way,\n\nKripa marked the course of Arjun, guessed his inmost thought aright,  \nThus he spake to brother warriors urging speed and instant fight:\n\n"Mark ye, chieftains, gallant Arjun wheels his sounding battle-car,  \n\'Gainst our prince and proud Duryodhan seeks to turn the tide of war,\n\nLet us fall upon our foeman and our prince and leader save,  \nFew save INDRA, god of battles, conquers Arjun fierce and brave,\n\nWhat were Matsya\'s fattened cattle, many thousands though they be,  \nIf our monarch sinks in battle like a ship in stormy sea!"\n\nVain were Kripa\'s words of wisdom, Arjun drove the chariot fair,  \nWhile his shafts like countless locusts whistled through the ambient air,\n\nKuru soldiers struck with panic neither stood and fought, nor fled,  \nGazed upon the distant Arjun, gazed upon their comrades dead!\n\nArjun twanged his mighty weapon, blew his far-resounding shell,  \nStrangely spake his monkey-standard, Kuru warriors knew it well,\n\nSankha\'s voice, Gandiva\'s accents, and the chariot\'s booming sound,  \nFilled the air like distant thunder, shook the firm and solid ground.\n\nKuru soldiers fled in terror or they slumbered with the dead,  \nAnd the rescued lowing cattle with their tails uplifted fled!\n\n## V\n\n## WARRIOR\'S GUERDON\n\nNow with joy the king Virata to his royal city came,  \nSaw the rescued herds of cattle, saw Uttara prince of fame,\n\nMarked the great and gallant Arjun, helmet-wearing, armour-cased  \nKnew Yudhishthir and his brothers now as royal princes dressed,\n\nAnd he greeted good Yudhishthir, truth-beloving brave and strong  \nAnd to valiant Arjun offered Matsya\'s princess fair and young!\n\n"Pardon, monarch," answered Arjun, "but I may not take as bride  \nMatsya\'s young and beauteous princess whom I love with father\'s pride,\n\nShe hath often met me trusting in the inner palace hall,  \nAs a daughter on a father waited on my loving call!\n\nI have trained her _kokil_ accents, taught her maiden steps in dance,  \nWatched her skill and varied graces all her native charms enhance,\n\nPure is she in thought and action, spotless as my hero boy,  \nGrant her to my son, O monarch, as his wedded wife and joy!\n\nAbhimanyu trained in battle, handsome youth of godlike face,  \nKrishna\'s sister, fair Subhadra, bore the child of princely grace,\n\nWorthy of thy youthful daughter, pure in heart and undefiled,  \nGrant it, sire, my Abhimanyu wed thy young and beauteous child!"\n\nAnswered Matsya\'s noble monarch with a glad and grateful heart:  \nWords like these befit thy virtue, nobly hast thou done thy part,\n\nBe it as thou sayest, Arjun, unto Pandu\'s race allied,  \nMatsya\'s royal line is honoured, Matsya\'s king is gratified!"\n\n## VI\n\n## THE WEDDING\n\nGood Yudhishthir heard the tidings and he gave his free assent,  \nUnto distant chiefs and monarchs kindly invitations sent,\n\nIn the town of Upa-plavya, of fair Matsya\'s towns the best,  \nMade their home the pious brothers to receive each royal guest.\n\nCame unto them Kasi\'s monarch and his armed troopers came,  \nAnd the king of fair Panchala with his sons of warlike fame,\n\nCame the sons of fair Draupadi early trained in art of war,  \nOther chiefs and sacrifices came from regions near and far.\n\nKrishna decked in floral garlands with his elder brother came,  \nAnd his sister fair Subhadra, Arjun\'s loved and longing dame,\n\nArjun\'s son brave Abhimanyu came upon his flowery car,  \nWith his elephants and chargers, troopers trained in art of war.\n\nVrishnis from the sea-girt Dwarka, bravo Andhakas known to fame,  \nBhojas from the mighty Chumbal with the righteous Krishna came,\n\nHe to gallant sons of Pandu made his presents rich and rare,  \nGems and gold and costly garments, slaves and damsels passing fair.\n\nWith its quaint and festive greetings came at last the bridal day,  \nMatsya maids were merry-hearted, Pandu\'s sons were bright and gay,\n\nConch and cymbal, horn and trumpet spake forth music soft and sweet  \nIn Virata\'s royal palace, in the peopled mart and street!\n\nAnd they slay the jungle red-deer, and they spread the ample board,  \nAnd prepare the cooling palm-drink with the richest viands stored,\n\nMimes and actors please the people, bards recite the ancient song,  \nGlories of heroic houses minstrels by their lays prolong!\n\nAnd deep-bosomed dames of Matsya, jasmine-form and lotus-face,  \nWith their pearls and golden garlands joyously the bridal grace,\n\nCircled by those royal ladies, though they all are bright and fair,  \nBrightest shines the fair Draupadi with a beauty rich and rare,\n\nStately dames and merry maidens lead the young and soft-eyed bride,  \nAs the queens of gods encircle INDRA\'S daughter in her pride!\n\nArjun from the Matsya monarch takes the princess passing fair,  \nFor his son by fair Subhadra, nursed by Krishna\'s loving care,\n\nWith a godlike grace Yudhishthir stands by faithful Arjun\'s side,  \nAs a father takes a daughter, takes the young and beauteous bride,\n\nJoins her hands to Abhimanyu\'s, and with cake and parched rice,  \nOn the altar brightly blazing doth the holy sacrifice.\n\nMatsya\'s monarch on the bridegroom rich and costly presents pressed,  \nElephants he gave two hundred, steeds seven thousand of the best,\n\nPoured libations on the altar, on the priests bestowed his gold,  \nOffered to the sons of Pandu rich domain and wealth untold.\n\nWith a pious hand Yudhishthir, true in heart and pure in mind,  \nMade his gifts, in gold and garments, kine and wealth of every kind,\n\nCostly chariots, beds of splendour, robes with thread of gold belaced.  \nViands rich and sweet confection, drinks the richest and the best,\n\nLands he gave unto the Brahman, bullocks to the labouring swain,  \nSteeds he gave unto the warrior, to the people gifts and grain.\n\nAnd the city of the Matsyas, teeming with a wealth untold.  \nShone with festive joy and gladness and with flags and cloth of gold.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book VII: The Council of War](maha07.htm)\n\n'
