[1882], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n2:1:3\n\np. 289\n\n### THIRD BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n2:1:3:11\\. The spring, the summer, and the rains, these seasons (represent)\nthe gods; and the autumn, the winter, and the dewy season represent the\nfathers. That half-moon which increases represents the gods, and that which\ndecreases represents the fathers. The day represents the gods, and the night\nrepresents the fathers. And, further, the forenoon represents the gods, and\nthe afternoon the fathers.\n\n2:1:3:22\\. Those seasons, then, are the gods and the fathers; and whosoever,\nknowing this, invokes them as the gods and fathers, with his invocation of the\ngods the gods comply, and with his invocation of the fathers the fathers\ncomply. Him the gods favour at his invocation of the gods, and him the fathers\nfavour at his invocation of the fathers, whosoever, knowing this, invokes (the\nseasons) as the gods and fathers.\n\n2:1:3:33\\. Now when he (the sun) moves northwards, then he is among the gods,\nthen he guards the gods; and when he moves southwards, then he is among the\nfathers, then he guards the fathers 1.\n\n2:1:3:44\\. When he (the sun) moves northwards, then one may set up his\nfires;--the gods have the evil dispelled\n\np. 290\n\nfrom them (by the sun): he (the sacrificer) therefore dispels the evil from\nhimself;--the gods are immortal: he therefore, though there is for him no\nprospect of immortality, attains the (full measure of) life, whosoever sets up\nhis fires during that time. Whosoever, on the other hand, sets up his fires\nwhen (the sun) moves southwards, he does not dispel the evil from him,--since\nthe fathers have not the evil dispelled from them (by the sun). The fathers\nare mortal: hence he dies before (he has attained the full measure of) life,\nwhosoever sets up his fires during that time.\n\n2:1:3:55\\. The spring is the priesthood, the summer the nobility, and the\nrainy season the common people (vi _s_ ): a Brahman therefore should set up\nhis fires in spring, since the spring is the priesthood; and a Kshatriya\nshould set them up in summer, since the summer is the nobility; and a Vai _s_\nya should set them up in the rainy season, since the rainy season is the\ncommon people.\n\n2:1:3:66\\. And whosoever 1 desires to become endowed with holy lustre\n(brahmavar _k_ asin), let him set up his fires in spring,--for the spring is\nthe priesthood,--and he will certainly become endowed with holy lustre.\n\n2:1:3:77\\. And whosoever desires to become a power (kshatra) 2 in prosperity\nand renown, let him set up his fires in summer,--for the summer is the\nnobility (kshatra),--and he will certainly become a power in prosperity and\nrenown.\n\n2:1:3:88\\. And whosoever may desire to be rich in progeny\n\np. 291\n\nand cattle, let him set up his fires in the rainy season 1,--for the rainy\nseason is the common people, and the people means food,--and he certainly\nbecomes rich in progeny and cattle, whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fires\nin the rainy season.\n\n2:1:3:99\\. [In the opinion of others] both these (classes of) seasons have the\nevil dispelled from them, for the sun is the dispeller of their evil, and as\nsoon as he rises he dispels the evil from both these (classes of seasons). He\nshould therefore set up his fires at any time, when he feels called upon to\nsacrifice; and should not put it off from one day to the morrow: for who knows\nthe morrow of man 2?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[289:1](sbe1242.htm#fr_669) According to the Ka _n_ va text, it is the rising\nsun, that guards the god-seasons and father-seasons respectively.\n\n[290:1](sbe1242.htm#fr_670) I.e. whatsoever Brahman, as the Ka _n_ va text\nreads.\n\n[290:2](sbe1242.htm#fr_671) Kshatra _m_ _s_ riya ya _s_ asa syam iti. The Ka\n_n_ va text reads: Kshatrasya pratima sya _m_ _s_ riya ya _s_ aseti,\n'whosoever should wish to be an image of the kshatra in wealth and glory.'\n\n[291:1](sbe1242.htm#fr_672) The Black Ya _g_ us recommends _s_ arad, autumn,\nfor the Agnyadheya in the case of a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n[291:2](sbe1242.htm#fr_673) Ko hi manushyasya _s_ vo veda. The Ka _n_ va text\nhas: Na vai manushya _h_ _s_ vastanam veda (veda) ko hi (!) tasmai manushyo ya\n_h_ _s_ vastana _m_ vidyat, 'in truth no man knows the morrow, for what man,\nthat knows the morrow, is there for him?'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 4.
