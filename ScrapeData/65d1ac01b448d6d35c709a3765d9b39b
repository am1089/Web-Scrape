Up to death (meditations have to be repeated); for then also it is thus\nseen in scripture.\n\nThe first adhikara _n_ a (of the present adhyaya) has established that\nrepetition is to be observed with regard to all meditations. But now a\ndistinction is made. Those meditations which aim at complete knowledge,\nterminate--in the same way as the beating of the rice grains is terminated by\nthe husks becoming detached from the grains--with their effect being\naccomplished; for as soon as the effect, i.e. perfect knowledge, has been\nobtained, no further effort can be commanded since scriptural instruction does\nnot apply to him who knows that Brahman--which is not the object of injunction\n--constitutes his Self. On the other hand a doubt arises whether the devotee\nis to repeat those meditations which aim at certain forms of\n\np. 352\n\nexaltation for a certain time only and then may stop; or whether he is to\nrepeat them again and again as long as he lives.\n\nHere the purvapakshin maintains that such meditations are to be carried on for\nsome time only and then to be given up, since this satisfies the demands of\nthose scriptural passages which teach meditations distinguished by repetition.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. The devotee is to reiterate those\nmeditations up to his death, since the supersensuous result (of such\nmeditations) is reached by means of the extreme meditation. For such works\nalso as originate a fruit to be enjoyed in a future state of existence\npresuppose, at the time of death, a creative cognition analogous to the fruit\nto be produced; as appears from such passages as, 'Endowed with knowledge\n(i.e. the conception of the fruit to be obtained) he (i.e. the individual\nsoul) goes after that (viz. the fruit) which is connected with that knowledge'\n(B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 2); 'Whatever his thought (at the time of death), with\nthat he goes into Pra _n_ a, and the Pra _n_ a united with light, together\nwith the individual Self, leads on to the world as conceived (at the moment of\ndeath)' (Pr. Up. IV, 2, 10). This also follows from the comparison to the\ncaterpillar (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 3). But the meditations under discussion do\nnot, at the time of death, require any other creative cognition but a\nrepetition of themselves. Such meditations therefore as consist in the\ncreative conception of a fruit to be obtained must be repeated up to the\nmoment of death. Analogously the scriptural text, Sat. Bra. X, 6, 3, 1--'With\nwhatever thought he passes away from this world'--declares that the meditation\nextends up to the time of death. Similarly Sm _ri_ ti says, 'Remembering\nwhatever form of being he in the end leaves this body, into that same form he\never passes, assimilated to its being' (Bha. Gita VIII, 6); and 'At the time\nof death with unmoved mind' (Bha. Gita VIII, 10). And that at the moment of\ndeath also there remains something to be done, the scriptural passage ( _Kh_.\nUp. III, 17. 6) also proves. 'Let a man, at the time of death, take refuge\nwith this triad.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 13](sbe38274.htm)\n\n"
