If it be objected that it is not so, on account of the difference (taught\nby the Veda); we reply that it is not so on account of the declaration of\n(Brahman)\n\np. 154\n\nbeing not such, with reference to each (declaration of difference).\n\nLet this be, but nevertheless it cannot be maintained that Brahman is devoid\nof difference and attributes, and does not possess double attributes either in\nitself or on account of difference of station.--Why not?--'On account of\ndifference.' The various vidyas teach different forms of Brahman; it is said\nto have four feet ( _Kh_. Up. III, 18, 1); to consist of sixteen parts (Pr.\nUp. VI, 1); to be characterised by dwarfishness (Ka. Up. V, 3); to have the\nthree worlds for its body (B _ri_. Up. I, 3, 22); to be named Vai _s_ vanara (\n_Kh_. Up. V, 11, 2), &c. Hence we must admit that Brahman is qualified by\ndifferences also.--But above it has been shown that Brahman cannot possess\ntwofold characteristics!--That also does not contradict our doctrine; for the\ndifference of Brahman's forms is due to its limiting adjuncts. Otherwise all\nthose scriptural passages which refer to those differences would be\nobjectless.\n\nAll this reasoning, we say, is without force 'on account of the declaration of\nits being not such, with reference to each,' i.e. because scripture declares,\nwith reference to all the differences produced by the limiting adjuncts, that\nthere is no difference in Brahman. Cp. such passages as the following: 'This\nbright immortal person in this earth, and that bright immortal person\nincorporated in the body; he indeed is the same as that Self (B _ri_. Up. II,\n5, 1). It, therefore, cannot be maintained that the connexion of Brahman with\nvarious forms is taught by the Veda.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[153:1](sbe38114.htm#fr_112) The limiting adjunct of the crystal, i.e. the red\ncolour of a thing, e.g. a flower with which the crystal is in contact, is as\nreal as the crystal itself; only the effect is an illusion.--But the limiting\nadjuncts of Brahman are in themselves illusion.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 13](sbe38116.htm)\n\n"
