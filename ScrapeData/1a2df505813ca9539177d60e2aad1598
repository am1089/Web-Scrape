He now separates the two spoons ( _g_ uhu and upabh _ri_ t), with\nthe text (Va _g_. S. II, 15 a), \'May I be victorious after the victory of Agni\nand Soma! with the impetus of the (sacrificial) food I urge myself on.\' With\nhis right hand he moves the _g_ uhu eastwards (from its usual place on the\nprastara-bunch upon the altar), with the text (ib. b), \'May Agni and Soma\ndrive him away who hates us, and whom\n\np. 237\n\nwe hate! with the impetus of the (sacrificial) food I drive him away.\' With\nhis left hand he moves the upabh _ri_ t westwards (from its place on the\nbarhis to outside the altar):--Thus, if the sacrificer himself (does it) 1.\n\n1:8:3:22\\. And if the Adhvaryu (does it, he says), \'May this sacrificer be\nvictorious after the victory of Agni and Soma! with the impetus of the food I\nurge him on;\' and, \'May Agni and Soma drive him away whom this sacrificer\nhates, and who hates him! with the impetus of the food I drive him away.\' Thus\nhe does at the full-moon sacrifice, because the full-moon offering belongs to\nAgni and Soma.\n\n1:8:3:33\\. At the new-moon sacrifice, on the other hand, he uses the texts\n(ib. c, d), \'May I be victorious after the victory of Indra and Agni 2! with\nthe impetus of the food I urge myself on;\' and, \'May Indra and Agni drive him\naway who hates us, and whom we hate! with the impetus of the food I drive him\naway:\'--Thus, if the sacrificer himself does it.\n\n1:8:3:44\\. And if the Adhvaryu (does it, he says), \'May this sacrificer be\nvictorious after the victory of Indra and Agni! with the impetus of the food I\nurge him on;\' and, \'May Indra and Agni drive him away whom this sacrificer\nhates, and who hates him! with the impetus of the food I drive him away.\' Thus\nhe says at the new-moon sacrifice, because the new-moon\n\np. 238\n\noffering belongs to Indra and Agni. And in this manner he separates (the\nspoons) according to the respective deities, This is why he thus separates\nthem:\n\n1:8:3:55\\. Behind the _g_ uhu stands the sacrificer, and behind the upabh _ri_\nt stands he who means evil to him: hereby, then, he brings the sacrificer\nforward to the front (or east), and the one who means evil him he drives back\n(or towards the west). Behind the _g_ uhu stands the eater (enjoyer), and\nbehind the upabh _ri_ t the one to be eaten (enjoyed): thus he now brings the\neater (enjoyer) to the front, and the one to be eaten (enjoyed) he drives\nback.\n\n1:8:3:66\\. Thus the separation (of the eater and the eaten) is effected in one\nand the same act; and hence from one and the same man spring both the enjoyer\n(the husband), and the one to be enjoyed (the wife): for now kinsfolk (gatya\n_h_ ) live sporting and rejoicing together, saying, \'In the fourth (or) third\nman (I.e. generation) we unite 1.\' And this is so in accordance with that\n(separation of the spoons).\n\np. 239\n\n1:8:3:77\\. Thereupon (the Adhvaryu) anoints the enclosing-sticks (paridhi)\nwith (the butter attaching to) the _g_ uhu. With that (spoon) with which he\nhas made offering to the gods, with which he has concluded the sacrifice, he\nthus gratifies the enclosing-sticks: this is why he anoints them with the _g_\nuhu.\n\n1:8:3:88\\. He anoints them (successively) 1, with the texts (Va _g_. S. II, 16\na-c), \'For the Vasus thee!\' \'For the Rudras thee!\' \'For the \xc3\x82dityas thee!\' For\nthese--to wit, the Vasus, Rudras, and \xc3\x82dityas--are three (classes of) gods:\n\'for them (I anoint) thee,\' he thereby says.\n\n1:8:3:99\\. Thereupon, taking hold of the (middle) enclosing-stick, he calls\n(on the \xc3\x82gnidhra) to bid (them) listen 2: thus (i.e. by touching the paridhi)\nit is for the enclosing-sticks that he calls for the _s_ rausha _t_. The _s_\nrausha _t_ -call assuredly is the sacrifice: hence he thereby expressly\ngladdens the enclosing-sticks by means of the sacrifice: for this reason he\ncalls for the _s_ rausha _t_ , while taking hold of the enclosing-stick.\n\n1:8:3:1010\\. Having called for the _s_ rausha _t_ (and been responded to by\nthe \xc3\x82gnidhra), he thus addresses (the Hot _ri_ ), \'The divine Hot _ri_ s 3 are\nsummoned--,\' the divine Hot _ri_ s, namely, are (represented by) these\n\np. 240\n\nenclosing-sticks, since these are Agnis (fires) 1. When he says, \'the divine\nHot _ri_ s are summoned (ishita),\' he means to say, \'the divine Hot _ri_ s are\nwished for (ish _t_ a).\' [He continues], \'--for the proclamation of success\n2,\'--for on this the gods themselves are indeed intent, to wit, that they\nshould speak what is favourable (conducive to success, sadhu), that they\nshould do what is favourable: hence he says \'for the proclamation of\nsuccess.\'--\'The human one is called upon for the song of praise (suktavaka)\n3!\' by these words he urges on this human Hot _ri_ to singing praises.\n\n1:8:3:1111\\. He now takes the prastara-bunch 4. The prastara assuredly is the\nsacrificer: hence whithersoever his sacrifice went, thither he thereby wishes\nhim good-speed 5! Now it is to the world of the gods that his sacrifice went;\nand to the world of the gods accordingly he thereby takes the sacrificer.\n\np. 241\n\n1:8:3:1212\\. Should he desire rain, let him take up (the prastara), with this\ntext (Va _g_. S. II, 16 d), \'Be ye in harmony with each other, O heaven and\nearth!\' for when heaven and earth are in harmony with each other, then indeed\nit rains 1: for this reason he says, \'be ye in harmony with each other, O\nheaven and earth!\'--\'May Mitra and Varu _n_ a favour thee with rain!\' whereby\nhe says, \'may he who rules over the rain favour thee with rain!\' Now he that\nrules over the rain is undoubtedly that blowing one (Vayu, the wind); and he,\nit is true, blows as one only; but, on entering into man, he becomes a forward\nand a backward moving one; and they are these two, the out-breathing and the\nin-breathing. And Mitra and Varu _n_ a assuredly are the out-breathing and in-\nbreathing; and hence he says by that (prayer), \'may he who rules over the rain\nfavour thee with rain!\' Let him then take it up, with this text, for then the\nrain will at all times be propitious. He anoints it (the prastara): thereby he\nmakes him (the sacrificer) an oblation, thinking, \'May he, as an oblation, go\nto the world of the gods!\'\n\n1:8:3:1313\\. He anoints the top (of the prastara with the butter) in the _g_\nuhu, the middle part (with that) in the upabh _ri_ t, and the lower end (with\nthat) in the dhruva; for the _g_ uhu is, as it were, the top, the upabh _ri_ t\nthe middle, and the dhruva the root.\n\np. 242\n\n1:8:3:1414\\. He anoints (each time), with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 16 e), \'May\n(the gods) eat, licking the anointed bird 1!\' He thereby causes it (the\nprastara and hence symbolically the sacrificer) to be a bird and fly up from\nthis world of men to the world of the gods. He then draws it twice (towards\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya) alow (near the ground). The reason why he must draw it alow (is\nthis): the prastara is the sacrificer; and in this way he does not remove him\nfrom this firm footing of his; and he, moreover, secures rain for this\nlocality.\n\n1:8:3:1515\\. He draws it along, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 16 f), \'Go to\nthe spotted (mares) of the Maruts!\' He means to say, \'Go to the world of the\ngods,\' when he says, \'Go to the spotted (mares) of the Maruts 2!\'--\'Having\nbecome a spotted cow, go to the sky and thence bring us rain hither!\' The\nspotted cow, doubtless, is this (earth): whatever rooted and rootless food is\nhere on this (earth), by that this (earth) is a spotted cow. \'Having become\n\np. 243\n\nthis (earth), go thou to the sky!\' this is what he thereby says. \'Thence bring\nus rain hither!\' From rain certainly spring vigour, sap, well-being: for this\nreason he says, \'thence bring us rain hither!\n\n1:8:3:1616\\. He then takes a single stalk from it. The prastara-bunch is the\nsacrificer; and therefore, if he were to throw the whole prastara (at once)\ninto the fire, the sacrificer would speedily go to yonder world. In this way,\nhowever, the sacrificer will live long; and what the full measure of human\nlife here on earth is, for that he takes this (single stalk) therefrom.\n\n1:8:3:1717\\. Having held (the prastara) for a moment, he throws it into the\nfire: whither his (the sacrificer\'s) one (part of) self (or, body) 1 went,\nthither he thereby causes it to go 2. But were he not to throw it into the\nfire, he would cut off the sacrificer from (yonder) world. In this way,\nhowever, he does not cut off the sacrificer from (yonder) world.\n\n1:8:3:1818\\. He throws it (with its top) to the east, for the east is the\nregion of the gods; or to the north, for the north is the region of man. With\nthe fingers only they should smooth it down, not with pieces of wood; since it\nis with sticks that they pierce any other corpse. Fearing, lest they should\ntreat it in the same way as any other corpse, they should smooth it down with\nthe fingers only, not with pieces of wood. When the Hot _ri_ recites the song\nof praise,--\n\n1:8:3:1919\\. The \xc3\x82gnidhra says (to the Adhvaryu), \'Throw\n\np. 244\n\n[paragraph continues] (the single stalk) after (the prastara)!\'--\'whither his\n(the sacrificer\'s) other self went, thither make it now go,\' this is what he\nthereby says. [The Adhvaryu] having thrown it silently after, touches himself\n1, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 16 f): \'Guardian of the eye art thou, O Agni;\nguard mine eye!\' In this way also he does not throw himself into the fire\nafter (the prastara or sacrificer).\n\n1:8:3:2020\\. He (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) then says 2 (to the Adhvaryu), \'Discourse\ntogether!\'--he thereby says, \'Make him (the sacrificer) discourse with the\ngods.\' [The Adhvaryu asks], \'Has he gone (to the gods), Agnidh?\' whereby he\nsays, \'Has he really gone?\'--\'He has gone!\' replies the other.--\'Bid (the\ngods) hear!\' by these words he (the Adhvaryu) means to say, \'Make him (the\nsacrificer) be heard, make him be noticed by the gods!\'--\'May (one or they)\nhear (srausha _t_ )!\' thereby he (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) means to say, \'They know him,\nthey have recognised him.\' Thus the Adhvaryu and the \xc3\x82gnidhra lead the\nsacrificer to the world of the gods.\n\n1:8:3:2121\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then says, \'Good-speed to the divine Hot _ri_ s\n3!\' The divine Hot _ri_ s assuredly are these enclosing-sticks, since these\nare Agnis (fires): it is to them that he thereby bids good-speed, and\ntherefore he says, \'good-speed to the\n\np. 245\n\ndivine Hot _ri_ s!\'--\'Success (svasti) to the human!\' thereby he desires that\nthis human Hot _ri_ may not fail.\n\n1:8:3:2222\\. He now throws the enclosing-sticks into the fire. The middle\nenclosing-stick he throws first, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 17 a), \'The\nstick which thou laidst around thee, O divine Agni, when thou wert concealed\nby the Pa _n_ is, I bring thee for thy pleasure; may it not prove faithless to\nthee!\'--With (ib. b), \'Approach ye the place beloved of Agni!\' he throws the\ntwo others after it.\n\n1:8:3:2323\\. He then 1 seizes the _g_ uha and the upabh _ri_ t at the same\ntime. For on the former occasion 2, when he anoints (the prastara sacrificer),\nhe makes him an oblation, thinking, \'May he, as an oblation, go to the world\nof the gods!\' for this reason he seizes the _g_ uhu and the upabh _ri_ t at\nthe same time.\n\n1:8:3:2424\\. He seizes them for the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ (the All-gods). For,\nassuredly, when any sacrificial food is taken without being announced to any\none deity, then all the gods think that they have a share in it. Now when he\ntakes that sacrificial food, the (residue of) butter, he does not announce it\nto any one deity; and hence he takes up (the two spoons) for the Vi _s_ ve\nDeva _h_ , and thus makes that (residue of butter) the vai _s_ vadeva 3 at the\nhavirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a.\n\n1:8:3:2525\\. He seizes them, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 18),\n\np. 246\n\n[paragraph continues] \'The residue (of the butter) ye have for your share, ye,\nmighty by (this) food!\' the residue, of course, is that which remains;--\'O ye\ngods, staying on the prastara, and representing the enclosing-sticks 1;\' for\nboth the prastara and the enclosing-sticks have been thrown into the\nfire;--\'All of you, applauding this speech,\' thereby he makes it the vai _s_\nvadeva (belonging to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ );--\'Be seated on this couch of\ngrass (barhis) and enjoy yourselves! Svaha! Va _t_  2!\' as one offers what has\nbeen consecrated by \'vasha _t_ ,\' this (residue) thereby becomes such for him\n(the sacrificer).\n\n1:8:3:2626\\. For whomsoever they take the sacrificial food from a cart, for\nhim they unyoke (the spoons, by placing them) on the yoke of that cart,\nthinking, \'Where we yoke, there we also unyoke 3;\' for from the same place\nwhere they yoke, they also unyoke. For him, on the other hand, for whom they\ntake it from a jar, (they unyoke the spoons, by placing them) on the wooden\nsword, thinking, \'Where we yoke, there we also unyoke;\' for from the same\nplace where they yoke, they also unyoke.\n\n1:8:3:2727\\. Yoke-fellows, indeed, are these two spoons for the sacrifice: he\nyokes them when he starts 4 (or,\n\np. 247\n\nfirst uses them). Now, were he only to release (unyoke) either of them after\nputting it down, it would fall down just as a draught animal 1 (would, if made\nto lie down before being unyoked). At the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t these two\nundergo an unyoking: he then lays them down, and so unyokes them. He then\nyokes them again, at the after-offerings. Having performed the after-\nofferings, he effects another unyoking: he lays them down, and so unyokes\nthem. Thereupon he yokes them again when he seizes them both at the same time;\nand when he has travelled over the way for which he has yoked them, he unyokes\nthem. After the sacrifice offspring (is produced). Hence this man yokes\n(unites), and then unyokes, and again yokes them; and when he has travelled\nover the way for which he yoked them, he finally unyokes them. He lays (the\nspoons) down, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 19 a), \'Fond of butter are ye;\nprotect the two yoke-fellows! gracious are ye: lead me to grace!\' whereby he\nsays, \'good are ye: lead me to goodness!\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[236:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_557) The whole of the third Brahma _n_ a is taken up\nwith the duties of the Adhvaryu and \xc3\x82gnidhra at the three ceremonies:\nparagraphs 1-19 with those at the suktavaka; pars. 20-22 with those at the _s_\na _m_ yuvaka; and pars. 23-27 with those at the offering of the remains (sa\n_m_ srava) of butter. The duties of the Hot _ri_ are then detailed in the\nfourth Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[237:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_558) In Taitt. Br. III, 3, 9 a different symbolical\nexplanation is given of the separation of the spoons: it is said there that by\nshifting the _g_ uhu eastwards, he drives away the enemies that have been\nborn; and by shifting the upabh _ri_ t towards the west, he drives away those\nthat will be born hereafter; and the sacrificer then stands firmly established\nin this world.\n\n[237:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_559) See [p. 162](sbe1227.htm#page_162), note\n[3](sbe1227.htm#fn_378).\n\n[238:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_560) This passage is of considerable importance, as\nshowing that the prohibition of intermarriage between near blood-relations,--\nso rigidly enforced in later times, and already formulated in passages such as\n\xc3\x82past. Dharm. II, 5, 15, 16, \'One must not give one\'s daughter to a man\nbelonging to the same gotra. Nor to one related (within six degrees) on the\nmother\'s (or father\'s) side.\' Gobh. III, 4, 3-5, \'One must take for one\'s wife\none who is not of the same gotra, or one who is not sapi _n_ _d_ a to one\'s\nmother,\'--was not as yet firmly established in our author\'s time. Harisvamin\nremarks on our text, that the Ka _n_ vas allow intermarriage in such cases\nfrom the third generation--(the Ka _n_ va text of the _S_ at. Br. reads, \'In\nthe third man we unite, in the fourth man we unite\')--and the Saurash _t_ ras\nfrom the fourth generation; and that the Dakshi _n_ atyas allow marriage with\ndaughters of the mother\'s brother, p. 239 and with sons of the father\'s\nsister. See Weber, Ind. Stud. X, p. 75; Max Muller, History of Ancient\nSanskrit Literature, p. 387; Buhler, Sacred Laws of the \xc3\x82ryas, I, p. 126.\n\n[239:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_561) Viz. in the order in which they were laid around,\ni.e. first the middle one, then the southern, and lastly the northern one.\nKaty. III, 5, 24.\n\n[239:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_562) The Adhvaryu calls on the \xc3\x82gnidhra with Make\nlisten (o _s_ ravaya);\' and the latter responds with \'Yea, may (one) listen!\n(astu _s_ rausha _t_ ).\' See I, 5, 2, 18 seq.\n\n[239:3](sbe1236.htm#fr_563) Saya _n_ a on Taitt. S. I, 1, 13 explains this by\n\'Impelled are the divine Hot _ri_ s by the highest Lord (parame _s_ vara).\'\n\n[240:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_564) On the Agnis officiating as Hot _ri_ , I, 2, 3, 1.\n\n[240:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_565) Thus Saya _n_ a explains bhadrava _k_ yaya on\nTaitt. S. I, 1, 13 (vol. i. p. 233). For the Hot _ri_ \'s formula itself, see\n_S_ at. Br. I, 9, 1, 4.\n\n[240:3](sbe1236.htm#fr_566) According to Katy. III, 6, 1, and the other\nSutras, the Adhvaryu adds here sukta bruhi, \'recite the praises (hymns)!\'\nwhich Saya _n_ a on Taitt. Br. III, 6, 15 combines with the preceding\nsuktavakaya, and explains thus: \'hota tva _m_ suktasya vako va _k_ ana _m_\nyasya so \'ya _m_ deva _h_ suktavaka _h_ (? i.e. Agni, cf. _S_ at. Br. I, 9, 1,\n4) tasmai suktavakaya devaya sukta bruhi, ida _m_ dyavap _ri_ thivim\nanuvakoktani _s_ obhanani va _k_ anani kathaya (!);\' but differently on Taitt.\nS. I, 1, 13, \'ida _m_ dyavap _ri_ thivi bhadram abhud (Taitt. Br. III, 5, 10)\nityadyanuvaka _h_ suktam, tasya vako va _k_ anam, tadartham manusho hota\npreshita _h_ ; ato heto _h_ , he hotas tat suktam bruhi.\'\n\n[240:4](sbe1236.htm#fr_567) The two stalks, called vidh _ri_ ti (separation),\nseparating the prastara-bunch from the barhis or grass-covering of the altar\n(cf. I, 3, 4, in), he puts back in the place whence they were taken. Katy.\nIII, 6, 4.\n\n[240:5](sbe1236.htm#fr_568) Svaga.? literally \'self-go,\' i.e.\' success to\nhim!\'\n\n[241:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_569) Cf. Ait. \xc3\x82r. III, I, 2, 2-4 (Max Muller, Up. I, p.\n249): \'The first half (of a sa _m_ hita or combination of final and initial\nletters) is the earth, the second half heaven, their uniting the rain, the\nuniter Par _g_ anya. And so it is when he (Par _g_ anya) rains thus strongly,\nwithout ceasing, day and night; then they say also (in ordinary language),\n"Heaven and earth have come together."\' See also _S_ at. Br. I, 7, 2, 16.\n\n[242:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_570) Vyantu vayo \'kta _m_ riha _n_ a _h_. Mahidhara\ninterprets it, \'May the birds (i.e. the metres) go (? to heaven,--taking and)\nlicking the anointed (prastara).\' The Ka _n_ vas read, \'vyantu vayo ripto riha\n_n_ a _h_.\' The Black Ya _g_ us (Taitt. S. I, 1, 13, 1) has \'akta _m_ riha _n_\na viyantu vaya _h_ , pra _g_ a _m_ yoni _m_ ma nirm _ri_ ksham, apyayantam apa\noshadhaya _h_ ,\' which Saya _n_ a explains by \'May the birds having licked the\nanointed (top) go their several ways,\' &c.; and the Taitt. Br. III, 3, 9, 3\nremarks to viyantu vaya _h_ , \'Having made him birds, he makes him go to the\nheavenly world.\' According to Saya _n_ a, the three above formulas are by\n\xc3\x82pastamba referred to the three acts of anointing, whereas the others, he\nsays, divide the first formula into two, and use the second one (pra _g_ am,\n&c.) while the lower part of the prastara is anointed. See, however,\nHillebrandt, Neu- and Vollm. p. 142, note 3.\n\n[242:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_571) The Black Ya _g_ us (Taitt. S. I, 1, 13) has, \'The\nspotted (mares) of the Maruts are ye (O plants)!\'\n\n[243:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_572) The itara atma in pars. 27 and 19 have to be taken\ncorrelatively.\n\n[243:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_573) That is to say, he makes sure that the sacrificer\nhas really obtained the object for which the sacrifice was undertaken,--the\nright to go to the heavenly world after his death.\n\n[244:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_574) He touches himself near the heart, or, according\nto Vaidyanatha, he touches his eyes. After this he has, as usual, to touch the\nlustral water. See [p. 2](sbe1203.htm#page_2), note [2](sbe1203.htm#fn_84).\n\n[244:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_575) Here begins the _s_ a _m_ yuvaka; see p. 241, note\n1.\n\n[244:3](sbe1236.htm#fr_576) \'Svaga\xc2\xb4 daivya hot _ri_ bhya _h_.\' The form daivya\nseems to have become fixed before hot _ri_ , in consequence of its frequent\nuse, especially in the \xc3\x82pri hymns, as nom. acc. dual daivya hotara; and in the\ninvocation of the I _d_ a, as nom. plur. daivya hotara _h_.\n\n[245:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_577) Here begins the offering of the remains (sa _m_\nsrava) of butter; see [p. 236](sbe1235.htm#page_236), note 2.\n\n[245:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_578) See par. 14 above.\n\n[245:3](sbe1236.htm#fr_579) The author again connects the havis-offering with\nthe more solemn Soma-sacrifice; the third, or evening, libation of Soma being\nsupposed to belong to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ ; cf. Va _g_. S. XIX, 26; Ait.\nBr. VI, 4.\n\n[246:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_580) Paridheya _h_ , literally \'ye who are to be laid\naround;\' according to Mahidhara = paridhibhava _h_. The Ka _n_ va text has\nparidhaya _h_ , \'enclosing-sticks.\' The Black Ya _g_ us (Taitt. S. I, 1, 13,\n2) has \'barhishada _h_ (sitting on the Barhis)\' instead.\n\n[246:2](sbe1236.htm#fr_581) The original meaning of this sacrificial call, as\nof the apparently allied vasha _t_ , vausha _t_ , appears to be, \'May he\n(Agni) carry it (the oblation to the deity)!\' Cf. [p.\n88](sbe1214.htm#page_88), note [2](sbe1214.htm#fn_254).\n\n[246:3](sbe1236.htm#fr_582) See I, 1, 2, 8.\n\n[246:4](sbe1236.htm#fr_583) This seems to refer to the time when he gets the\nspoons ready for their sacred use. He then wipes them with sacrificial grass;\nthat is, he, as it were, rubs down the horses before starting on his journey\nto the world of the gods. See [p. 68](sbe1212.htm#page_68), note\n[1](sbe1212.htm#fn_208).\n\n[247:1](sbe1236.htm#fr_584) I adopt the interpretation of Harisvamin, who\ntranslates avar _kh_ et by adha _h_ patet. The St. Petersb. Dict. apparently\nproposes, \'he would unharness them, as he would unharness a horse (or team).\'\nAccording to Harisvamin, the author here controverts the view of the Karakas (\n_k_ araka _s_ ruti), who apparently taught that the (symbolical) unharnessing\nof the spoons should succeed their being laid down on the yoke; while our\nauthor maintains that the unharnessing should precede the laying down.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 9, 1.
