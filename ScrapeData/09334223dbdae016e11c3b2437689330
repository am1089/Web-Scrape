Destroy those who seek to do thee harm; overcome thy enemies.'\n\np. 147\n\n2. 2 After (the boy) has taken off his old (garment), (the teacher) makes him put on a (new) garment that has not yet been washed, with (the verses),\n\n'The goddesses who spun, who wove, who spread out, and who drew out the skirts\non both sides, may those goddesses clothe thee with long life. Blessed with\nlife put on this garment.\n\n'Dress him; through (this) garment make him reach a hundred (years) of age;\nextend his life. B _ri_ haspati has given this garment to king Soma that he\nmay put it on.\n\n'Mayst thou live to old age; put on the garment! Be a protector of the human\ntribes against imprecation. Live a hundred years, full of vigour; clothe\nthyself in the increase of wealth.'\n\n3. 3 Having (thus) made (the boy) put on (the new garment, the teacher) recites over him (the verse),\n\n'Thou hast put on this garment for the sake of welfare; thou hast become a\nprotector of thy friends against imprecation. Live a hundred long years; a\nnoble man, blessed with life, mayst thou distribute wealth.'\n\n4. 4 He then winds the girdle three times from left to right round (the boy, so that it covers) his navel. (He does so only) twice, according to some (teachers). (It is done) with (the verse),\n\np. 148\n\n'Here she has come to us who drives away sin, purifying our guard and our\nprotection, bringing us strength by (the power of) inhalation and exhalation,\nthe sister of the gods, this blessed girdle.'\n\n5\\. On the north side of the navel he makes a threefold knot (in the girdle)\nand draws that to the south side of the navel.\n\n6. 6 He then arranges for him the skin (of an antelope, &c., see Sutra 7) as an outer garment, with (the Mantras),\n\n'The firm, strong eye of Mitra, glorious splendour, powerful and flaming, a\nchaste, mobile vesture, this skin put on, a valiant (man), N.N.!\n\n'May Aditi tuck up thy garment, that thou mayst study the Veda, for the sake\nof insight and belief and of not forgetting what thou hast learnt, for the\nsake of holiness and of holy lustre!'\n\n7. 7 The skin of a black antelope (is worn) by a Brahma _n_ a, the skin of a spotted deer by a Ra _g_ anya, the skin of a he-goat by a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n8. 8 He then gives him in charge (to the gods), a Brahma _n_ a with (the verse), 'We give this (boy) in charge, O Indra, to Brahman, for the sake of great learning. May he (Brahman?) lead him to old age, and may he (the boy) long watch over learning.'\n\np. 149\n\nA Ra _g_ anya (he gives in charge to the gods) with (the verse), 'We give this\nboy in charge, O Indra, to Brahman, for the sake of great royalty. May he lead\nhim to old age, and may he long watch over royalty.'\n\nA Vai _s_ ya (he gives in charge) with (the verse), 'We give this boy in\ncharge, O Indra, to Brahman, for the sake of great wealth. May he lead him to\nold age, and may he long watch over wealth.'\n\n9. 9 (The teacher) makes him sit down to the west of the fire, facing the north, and makes him eat the remnants of the sacrificial food, with these (Mantras), 'On thee may wisdom, on thee may offspring' (Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, Andhra redaction, X, 44),\xc2\x97altering (the text of the Mantras).\n\n10. 10 Some make (the student) eat 'sprinkled butter.'\n\n11\\. (The teacher) looks at (the student) while he is eating, with the two\nverses, 'At every pursuit we invoke strong (Indra)' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 1,\n2, 1), (and), 'Him, Agni, lead to long life and splendour' (Taitt: Sa _m_ h.\nII, 3, 10, 3).\n\n12\\. Some make (the boy) eat (that food with these two verses).\n\n13. 13 After (the boy) has sipped water, (the teacher) causes him to touch (water) and recites over him (the verse), 'A hundred autumns are before us, O gods, before ye have made our bodies decay, before (our)\n\np. 150\n\nsons have become fathers; do not destroy us before we have reached (our due)\nage.'\n\nEnd of the First Pa _t_ ala.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[146:1](sbe30047.htm#fr_490) 4, 1.

Instead of paridatava u, we ought to read, as the Atharva-veda\nhas, paridhatava u.\n\n[147:3](sbe30047.htm#fr_492) Atharva-veda II, 13, 3; XIX, 24, 6.\n\n[147:4](sbe30047.htm#fr_493) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II, 2, 1; Paraskara II, 2, 8. The\ntext of the Mantra as given by Hira _n_ yake _s_ in is very corrupt, but the\ncorruptions may be as old as the Hira _n_ yake _s_ i-sutra itself, or even\nolder.\n\n[148:6](sbe30047.htm#fr_494) I propose to correct _g_ arish _n_ u into _k_\narish _n_ u.

The verse seems to be an adaptation of a Mantra\nwhich contained a form of the verb pari-dha (comp. Atharva-veda XIX, 24, 2);\nthus the reading pari . . . dadhmasi found in the MSS. may be easily accounted\nfor. The second hemistich is very corrupt, but the Atharva-veda (loc. cit.:\nyathaina _m_ _g_ arase nayat) shows at least the general sense.\n\n[149:9](sbe30047.htm#fr_497) The text of those Mantras runs thus, 'On me may\nwisdom, &c.'; he alters them so as to say, 'On thee,' &c.\n\n[149:10](sbe30047.htm#fr_498) Regarding the term sprinkled butter,' comp. \xc3\x82\n_s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya IV, 1, 18. 19.\n\n[149:13](sbe30047.htm#fr_499) _Ri_ g-veda I, 89. 9.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 5](sbe30048.htm)\n\n"
