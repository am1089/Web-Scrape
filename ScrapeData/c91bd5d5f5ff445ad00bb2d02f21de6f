Long had\nthey wished and prayed that the gods would send them a son; but it was all in\nvain, their prayers were not granted. One day a number of fish were brought\ninto the royal kitchen to be cooked for the Rajah's dinner, and amongst them\nwas one little fish that was not dead; but all the rest were dead. One of the\npalace maid-servants, seeing this, took the little fish and put him in a basin\nof water. Shortly afterwards the Ranee saw him, and thinking him very pretty,\nkept him as a pet; and because she had no children she lavished all her\naffection on the fish, and loved him as a son; and the people called him\nMuchie-Rajah (the Fish Prince). In a little while Muchie-Rajah had grown too\nlong to live in the small basin, so they put him in a larger one; and then\n(when he grew too long for that) into a big tub. In time, however, Muchie-\nRajah became too large for even the big tub to hold him; so the Ranee had a\ntank made for him in which he lived very happily, and twice a day she fed him\nwith boiled rice. Now, though the people fancied Muchie-Rajab was only a fish,\nthis was not the case. He was, in truth, a young Rajah who had angered the\ngods, and been by them turned into a fish and thrown into the river as a\npunishment.\n\nOne morning when the Ranee brought him his daily meal of boiled rice, Muchie-\nRajah called out to her and said, 'Queen Mother, Queen Mother, I am so lonely\nhere all by myself Can not you get me a wife?' The Ranee promised to try, and\nsent messengers to all the people she knew, to ask if they would allow one of\ntheir children to marry her son, the Fish Prince. But they all answered, 'We\ncannot give one of our dear little daughters to be devoured by a great fish,\neven though he is the Muchie-Rajah and so high in your Majesty's favour.'\n\nAt news of this the Ranee did not know what to do. She was so foolishly fond\nof Muchie-Rajah, however, that she resolved to get him a wife at any cost.\nAgain she sent out messengers; but this time she gave them a great bag\ncontaining a lac of gold mohurs,  1 and said to them, 'Go into every land\nuntil you find a wife for my Muchie-Rajah, and to whoever will give you a\nchild to be the Muchie-Ranee,  2 you shall give this bag of gold mohurs.' The\nmessengers started on their search, but for some time they were unsuccessful:\nnot even the beggars were to be tempted to sell their children, fearing the\ngreat fish would devour them. At last one day the messengers came to a village\nwhere there lived a Fakeer, who had lost his first wife and married again. His\nfirst wife had had one little daughter, and his second wife also had a\ndaughter. As it happened, the Fakeer's second wife hated her little step-\ndaughter, always gave her the hardest work to do, and the least food to eat,\nand tried by every means in her power to get her out of the way, in order that\nthe child might not rival her own daughter. When she heard of the errand on\nwhich the messengers had come, she sent for them when the Fakeer was out, and\nsaid to them, 'Give me the bag of gold mohurs and you shall take my little\ndaughter to marry the Muchie-Rajah' (for, she thought to herself. 'The great\nfish will certainly eat the girl, and she will thus trouble us no more ').\nThen, turning to her step-daughter, she said, 'Go down to the river and wash\nyour saree, that you may be fit to go with these people, who will take you to\nthe Ranee's court.' At these words the poor girl went down to the river very\nsorrowful, for she saw no hope of escape, as her father was from home. As she\nknelt by the river-side, washing her saree and crying bitterly, some of her\ntears fell into the hole of an old Seven-headed Cobra who lived in the river-\nbank. This Cobra was a very wise animal, and seeing the maiden he put his head\nout of his hole, and said to her, 'Little girl, why do you cry? '--' O sir,'\nshe answered, 'I am very unhappy, for my father is from home, and my\nstepmother has sold me to the Ranee's people to be the wife of the Muchie-\nRajah, that great fish, and I know he will eat me up.'--' Do not be afraid, my\ndaughter,' said the Cobra, 'but take with you these three stones and tie them\nup in the corner of your saree.' And so saying he gave her three little round\npebbles. 'The Muchie-Rajah, whose wife you are to be, is not really a fish,\nbut a Rajah who has been enchanted. Your home will be a little room which the\nRanee has had built in the tank-wall. When you are taken there, wait, and be\nsure you don't go to sleep, or the Muchie-Rajah will certainly come and eat\nyou up. But as you hear him coming rushing through the water, be prepared, and\nas soon as you see him, throw this first stone at him; he will then sink to\nthe bottom of the tank. The second time he comes, throw the second stone, when\nthe same thing will happen. The third time he comes, throw this third stone,\nand he will immediately resume his human shape.' So saying, the old Cobra\ndived down again into his hole. The Fakeer's daughter took the stones, and\ndetermined to do as the Cobra had told her, though she hardly believed it\nwould have the desired effect.\n\nWhen she reached the palace, the Ranee spoke kindly to her, and said to the\nmessengers, 'You have done your errand well--this is a dear little girl.' Then\nshe ordered that she should be let down the side of the tank in a basket, to a\nlittle room which had been prepared for her. When the Fakeer's daughter got\nthere, she thought she had never seen such a pretty place in her life (for the\nRanee had caused the little room to be very nicely decorated for the wife of\nher favourite), and she would have felt very happy away from her cruel step-\nmother and all the hard work she had been made to do, had it not been for the\ndark water that lay black and unfathomable below the door, and the fear of the\nterrible Muchie-Rajah.\n\nAfter waiting some time she heard a rushing sound, and little waves came\ndashing against the threshold; faster they came and faster, and the noise got\nlouder and louder, until she saw a great fish's head above the water--the\nMuchie-Rajah was coming towards her open-mouthed. The Fakeer's daughter seized\none of the stones that the Cobra had given her and threw it at him, and down\nhe sank to the bottom of the tank; a second time he rose and came towards her,\nshe threw the second stone at him, and he again sank down; a third time he\ncame, more fiercely than before, when, seizing the third stone, she threw it\nwith all her force. No sooner did it touch him than the spell was broken, and\nthere, instead of a fish, stood a handsome young Prince. The poor little\nFakeer's daughter was so startled that she began to cry. But the Prince said\nto her, 'Pretty maiden, do not be frightened. You have rescued me from a\nhorrible thraldom, and I can never thank you enough; but if you will be the\nMuchie-Ranee, we will be married to-morrow.' Then he sat down on the door-step\nthinking over his strange fate, and watching for the dawn.\n\nNext morning early, several inquisitive people came to see if the Muchie-Rajah\nhad eaten up his poor little wife, as they feared he would; what was their\nastonishment, on looking over the tank wall, to see, not the Muchie-Rajah, but\na magnificent Prince! The news soon spread to the palace. Down came the Rajah,\ndown came the Ranee, down came all their attendants and dragged Muchie-Rajah\nand the Fakeer's daughter up the side of the tank in a basket; and when they\nheard their story, there were great and unparalleled rejoicings. The Ranee\nsaid, 'So I have indeed found a son at last!' And the people were so\ndelighted, so happy, and proud of the new Prince and Princess, that they\ncovered all their path with damask from the tank to the palace, and cried to\ntheir fellows, 'Come and see our new Prince and Princess! Were ever any so\ndivinely beautiful? Come; see a right royal couple! A pair of mortals like the\ngods!' And when they reached the palace the Prince was married to the Fakeer's\ndaughter.\n\nThere they lived very happily for some time. When the Muchie-Ranee's\nstepmother heard what had happened, she came often to see her step-daughter,\nand pretended to be delighted at her good fortune; and the Ranee was so good\nthat she quite forgave all her stepmother's former cruelty, and always\nreceived her very kindly. At last, one day, the Muchie-Ranee said to her\nhusband, 'It is a weary while since I saw my father. If you will give me\nleave, I should much like to visit my native village and see him again.'--'\nVery well,' he replied, 'you may go. But do not stay away long; for there can\nbe no happiness for me till you return.' So she went, and her father was\ndelighted to see her; but her stepmother, though she pretended to be very\nkind, was, in reality, only glad to think she had got the Ranee into her\npower, and determined, if possible, never to allow her to return to the palace\nagain. One day, therefore, she said to her own daughter, 'It is hard that your\nstep-sister should have become Ranee of all the land, instead of being eaten\nup by the great fish, while we gained no more than a lac of gold mohurs. Do\nnow as I bid you, that you may become Ranee in her stead.' She then went on to\ninstruct her how that she must invite the Ranee down to the riverbank and\nthere beg her to let her try on her jewels, and whilst putting them on, give\nher a push and drown her in the river.\n\nThe girl consented, and standing by the river-bank said to her step-sister,\n'Sister, may I try on your jewels? how pretty they are!'--'Yes,' said the\nRanee, 'and we shall be able to see in the river how they look.' So, undoing\nher necklaces she clasped them round the other's neck; but whilst she was\ndoing so, her stepsister gave her a push, and she fell backwards into the\nwater. The girl watched to see that the body did not rise, and then, run-fling\nback, said to her mother, 'Mother, here are all the jewels; and she will\ntrouble us no more.' But it happened that just when her step-sister pushed the\nRanee into the river, her old friend the Seven-headed Cobra chanced to be\nswimming across it, and seeing the little Ranee like to be drowned, he carried\nher on his back until he reached his hole, into which he took her safely. Now\nthis hole, in which the Cobra and his wife and all his little ones lived, had\ntwo entrances--the one under water and leading to the river, and the other\nabove water, leading out into the open fields. To this upper end of his hole\nthe Cobra took the Muchie-Ranee, and there he and his wife took care of her;\nand there she lived with them for some time. Meanwhile the wicked Fakeer's\nwife, having dressed up her own daughter in all the Ranee's jewels, took her\nto the palace, and said to the Muchie-Rajah, 'See, I have brought your wife,\nmy dear daughter, back safe and well.' The Rajah looked at her, and thought,\n'This does not look like my wife.' However, the room was dark, and the girl\ncleverly disguised, and he thought he might be mistaken. Next day he said\nagain, 'My wife must be sadly changed, or this cannot be she; for she was\nalways bright and cheerful. She had pretty loving ways and merry words; while\nthis woman never opens her lips.' Still he did not like to seem to mistrust\nhis wife, and comforted himself by saying, 'Perhaps she is tired with the long\njourney.' On the third day, however, he could bear the uncertainty no longer,\nand tearing off her jewels saw, not the face of his own little wife, but\nanother woman. Then he was very angry, and turned her out of doors, saying,\n'Begone! since you are but the wretched tool of others, I spare your life.'\nBut of the Fakeer's wife he said to his guards, 'Fetch that woman here\ninstantly; for unless she can tell me where my wife is, I will have her\nhanged!' It chanced, however, that the Fakeer's wife had heard of the Muchie-\nRajah having turned her daughter out of doors; so, fearing his anger, she hid\nherself, and was not to be found.\n\nMeantime, the Muchie-Ranee, not knowing how to get home, continued to live in\nthe great Seven-headed Cobra's hole, and he and his wife and all his family\nwere very kind to her, and loved her as if she had been one of themselves; and\nthere her little son was born, and she called him Muchie-Lal  3 after the\nMuchie Rajah, his father. Muchie-Lal was a lovely child, merry and brave, and\nhis playmates all day long were the young Cobras.  4 When he was about three\nyears old, a Bangle-seller came by tha way, and the Muchie-Ranee bought some\nbangles from him and put them on her boy's wrists and ankles; but by next day,\nin playing, he had broken them all. Then, seeing the Bangle-seller the Ranee\ncalled him again and bought some more, and so on every day, until the Bangle-\nseller got quite rich from selling so many bangles for the Muchie-Lal; for the\nCobra's hole was full a treasure, and he gave the Muchie-Ranee as much money\nto spend every day as she liked. There was nothing she wished for he did not\ngive her, only he would not let her try to get home to he husband, which she\nwished more than all. When she asked him he would say, 'No, I will not let you\ngo. If your husband come here and fetches you, it is well; but I will not\nallow you to wander in search of him through the land alone.'\n\nAnd so she was obliged to stay where she was.\n\nAll this time the poor Muchie-Rajah was hunting in every part of the country\nfor his wife, but he could learn no tidings of her For grief and sorrow at\nlosing her he had gone well nigh distracted, and did nothing but wander from\nplace to place crying 'She is gone! she is gone!' Then, when he had long\ninquire without avail of all the people in her native village about her, he\none day met a Bangle-seller, and said to him, 'Whence do you come?' The\nBangle-seller answered, 'I have just been selling bangles to some people who\nlive in a Cobra's hole in the river bank.'--' People! what people?' asked the\nRajah. 'Why,' answered the Bangle-seller, 'a woman and a child--the child is\nthe most beautiful I ever saw. He is about three years old, and, of course,\nrunning about, is always breaking his bangles, and his mother buys him new\nones every day!'--' Do you know what th child's name is?' said the Rajah.\n'Yes,' answered the Bangle-seller carelessly, 'for the lady always calls him\nher Muchie-Lal.\n\n\\--'Ah!' thought the Muchie-Rajah, 'this must be my wife.' Then he said to him\nagain, 'Good Bangle-seller, I would see these strange people of whom you\nspeak; cannot you take me there?'--' No l to-night,' replied the Bangle-\nseller; 'daylight has gone, and we should only frighten them; but I shall be\ngoing there again to morrow, and then you may come too. Meanwhile, come and\nreside at my house for the night, for you look faint and weary.' The Rajah\nconsented. Next morning, however, very early, he woke the Bangle-seller,\nsaying, 'Pray let us go now and see the people you spoke about\nyesterday.'--'Stay,' said the Bangle-seller; 'it is much too early. I never go\ntill after breakfast.' So the Rajah had to wait till the Bangle-seller was\nready to go. At last they started off and when they reached the Cobra's hole,\nthe first thing the Rajah saw was a fine little boy playing with the young\nCobras.\n\nAs the Bangle-seller came along, jingling his bangles, a gentle voice from\ninside the hole called out, 'Come here, my Muchie-Lal, and try on your\nbangles.' Then the Muchie-Rajah, kneeling down at the mouth of the hole, said,\n'O Lady, show your beautiful face to me.' At the sound of his voice the Ranee\nran out, crying, 'Husband, husband! have you found me again?' And she told him\nhow her sister had tried to drown her, and how the good Cobra had saved her\nlife, and taken care of her and her child. Then he said, 'And will you now\ncome home with me?' And ~he told him how the Cobra would never let her go, and\nsaid, 'I will first tell him of your coming; for he has been as a father to\nme.' So she called out, 'Father Cobra, Father Cobra, my husband has come to\nfetch me; will you let me go? '--' Yes,' he said, 'if your husband has come to\nfetch you, you may go.' And his wife said, 'Farewell, dear Lady, we are loath\nto lose you, for we have loved you as a daughter.' And all the little Cobras\nwere very sorrowful to think that they must lose their playfellow, the young\nPrince. Then the Cobra gave the Muchie-Rajah and the Muchie-Ranee, and Muchie-\nLal, all the most costly gifts he could find in his treasure-house; and so\nthey went home, where they lived very happy ever after, and so may you be\nhappy too.\n\n![](img/41.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd23.htm#fr_69) A lac of gold mohurs is equal to \xc2\xa3150,000.\n\n[2](odd23.htm#fr_70) Fish Queen.\n\n[3](odd23.htm#fr_71) Little ruby fish.\n\n[4](odd23.htm#fr_72) See Notes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XX.
