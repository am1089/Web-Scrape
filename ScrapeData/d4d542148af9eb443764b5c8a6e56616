Khadira-G _ri_ hya IV, 3, 10 seq.\n\n[127:7](sbe30041.htm#fr_441) Perhaps we ought to follow the commentary and to\ntranslate, 'When (the cow-stable) becomes heated (by the fire on which he is\ngoing to sacrifice),' &c. ('gosh _th_ e\xe0\xa4\xbdgnim upasamadhayaiva homo na kartavya\n_h_ , kin tv agnim upasamadhayapi tavat pratiksha _n_ iya _m_ yavad gosh _th_\nam upatapyamana _m_ bhavati'). I have translated _k_ ivaram according to the\nordinary meaning of the word; in the commentary it is taken as equivalent to\nlauha _k_ ur _n_ am (copper filings).\n\n[128:15](sbe30041.htm#fr_442) Khadira-G _ri_ hya IV, 3, 6.\n\n[128:16](sbe30041.htm#fr_443) 16 seq.
