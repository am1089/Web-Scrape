The Deaf Man was to\nsee for the Blind Man, and the Blind Man was to hear for the Deaf Man.\n\nOne day both went to a nautch  1 together. The Deaf Man said, 'The dancing is\nvery good, but the music is not worth listening to;' and the Blind Man said,\n'On the contrary, I think the music very good, but the dancing is not worth\nlooking at.'\n\nAfter this they went together for a walk in the jungle, and there they found a\nDhobee's donkey that had strayed away from its owner, and a great big chattee\n(such as Dhobees boil clothes in), which the donkey was carrying with him.\n\nThe Deaf Man said to the Blind Man, 'Brother, here are a donkey and a Dhobee's\ngreat big chattee, with nobody to own them! Let us take them with us, they may\nbe useful to us some day.'--'Very well,' said the Blind Man, 'we will take\nthem with us.' So the Blind Man and the Deaf Man went on their way, taking the\ndonkey and the great big chattee with them. A little further on they came to\nan ants' nest, and the Deaf Man said to the Blind Man, 'Here are a number of\nvery fine black ants, much: larger than any I ever saw before. Let us take\nsome of them home to show our friends.'--' Very well,' answered the Blind Man,\n'we will take them as a present to our friends.' So the Deaf Man took a silver\nsnuff-box out of his pocket, and put four or five of the finest black ants\ninto it; which done, they continued their journey.\n\nBut before they had gone very far, a terrible storm came on. It thundered and\nlightened, and rained, and blew with such fury that it seemed as if the whole\nheavens and earth were at war. 'Oh dear oh dear!' cried the Deaf Man, 'how\ndreadful this lightning is; let us make haste and get to some place of\nshelter.' 'I don't see that it's dreadful at all,' answered the Blind Man,\n'but the thunder is very terrible; we had better certainly seek some place of\nshelter.'\n\nNow, not far from them was a lofty building, which looked exactly like a fine\ntemple. The Deaf Man saw it, and he and the Blind Man resolved to spend the\nnight there; and, having reached the place, they went in and shut the door,\ntaking the donkey and the great big chattee with them. But this building,\nwhich they mistook for a temple, was in truth no temple at all, but the house\nof a very powerful Rakshas; and hardly had the Blind Man, the Deaf Man, and\nthe donkey got inside, and fastened the door, than the Rakshas, who had been\nout, returned home. To his surprise he found the door fastened, and heard\npeople moving about inside his house. 'Ho! ho!' cried he to himself, 'some men\nhave got in here, have they? I'll soon make mince-meat of them!' So he began\nto roar in a voice louder than the thunder, crying, 'Let me into my house this\nminute, you wretches! let me in, let me in, I say!' and to kick the door and\nbatter it with his great fists. But though his voice was very powerful, his\nappearance was still more alarming, insomuch that the Deaf Man, who was\npeeping at him through a chink in the wall, felt so frightened that he did not\nknow what to do. But the Blind Man was very brave (because he couldn't see),\nand went up to the door, and called out, 'Who are you? and what do you mean by\ncoming battering at the door in this way, and at this time of night?'\n\n'I 'm a Rakshas,' answered the Rakshas angrily, 'and this is my house. Let me\nin this instant, or I'll kill you!' All this time the Deaf Man, who was\nwatching the Rakshas, was shivering and shaking in a terrible fright, but the\nBlind Man was very brave (because he couldn't see), and he called out again,\n'Oh, you 're a Rakshas, are you? Well, if you 're Rakshas, I'm Bakshas; and\nBakshas is as good as Rakshas.'--' Bakshas I' roared the Rakshas.\n\n'Bakshas! Bakshas! What nonsense is this? There is no such creature as a\nBakshas!'--' Go away,' replied the Blind Man, 'and don't dare to make any\nfurther disturbance, lest I punish you with a vengeance; for know that I am\nBakshas! and Bakshas is Rakshas' father.'--' My father?' answered the Rakshas.\n'Heavens and earth! Bakshas! and my father? I never heard such an\nextraordinary thing in my life. You my father, and in there? I never knew my\nfather was called Bakshas!'\n\n'Yes,' replied the Blind Man; 'go away instantly, I command you, for I am your\nfather Bakshas.'--' Very well,' answered the Rakshas (for he began to get\npuzzled and frightened), 'but, if you are my father, let me first see your\nface.' (For he thought, 'Perhaps they are deceiving me.') The Blind Man and\nthe Deaf Man didn't know what to do! but at last they opened the door--a very\ntiny chink--and poked the donkey's nose out. When the Rakshas saw it he\nthought to himself, 'Bless me, what a terribly ugly face my father Bakshas\nhas!' He then called out, 'O father Bakshas, you have a very big fierce face;\nbut people have sometimes very big heads and very little bodies. Pray let me\nsee you, body as well as head, before I go away.' Then the Blind Man and the\nDeaf Man rolled the great big Dhobee's chattee with a thundering noise past\nthe chink in the door, and the Rakshas, who was watching attentively, was very\nmuch surprised when he saw this great black thing rolling along the floor, and\nhe thought, 'In truth, my father Bakshas has a very big body! as well as a big\nhead. He's big enough to eat me up altogether .I'd better go away.' But still\nhe could not help being a little doubtful, so he cried, 'O Bakshas, father\nBakshas! you have indeed got a very big head and a very big body; but do,\nbefore I go away, let me hear you scream' (for all Rakshas scream fear-fully).\nThen the cunning Deaf Man (who was getting less frightened) pulled the silver\nsnuff-box out of his pocket, and took the lack ants out of it, and put one\nblack ant in the donkey's right ear, and another black ant in the donkey's\nleft ear, and another, and another. The ants pinched the poor donkey's ears\ndreadfully, and the donkey was so hurt and frightened, he began to bellow as\nloud as he could, 'Eh augh! eh aught eh aught augh! augh;and at this terrible\nnoise the Rakshas fled away in a great fig saying, 'Enough, enough, father\nBakshas, the sound of your voice would make your most refractory children\nobedient.' And mo sooner had he gone, than the Deaf Man took the ants out of\nthe donkey's ears, and he and the Blind Man spent the rest of the night in\npeace and comfort.\n\nNext morning the Deaf Man woke the Blind Man early, saying, 'Awake, brother,\nawake; here we are indeed in luck! the whole floor is covered with heaps of\ngold and silver and precious stones.' And so it was; for the Rakshas owned a\nvast amount of treasure, and the whole house was full of it. 'That is a good\nthing,' said the Blind Man. 'Show me where it is, and I will help you to\ncollect it.' So they collected as much treasure as possible, and made four\ngreat bundles of it. The Blind Man took one great bundle, the Deaf Man took\nanother; and putting the other two great bundles on the donkey, they started\noff to return home. But the Rakshas whom they had frightened away the night\nbefore had not gone very far off, and was waiting to see what his father\nBakshas might look like by daylight. He saw the door of his house open, and\nwatched attentively, when out walked--only a Blind Man, a Deaf Man, and a\ndonkey, who were all three laden with large bundles of his treasure! The Blind\nMan carried one bundle, the Deaf Man carried another bundle, and two bundles\nwere on the donkey.\n\nThe Rakshas was extremely angry, and immediately called six of his friends to\nhelp him kill the Blind Man, the Deaf Man, and the donkey, and recover the\ntreasure.\n\nThe Deaf Man saw them coming (seven great Rakshas, with hair a yard long, and\ntusks like an elephant's), and was dreadfully frightened; but the Blind Man\nwas very brave (because he couldn't see), and said, 'Brother, why do you lag\nbehind in that way?--' Oh!' answered the Deaf Man, 'there are seven great\nRakshas with tusks like an elephant's coming to kill us; what can we\ndo?'--'Let us hide the treasure in the bushes,' said the Blind Man; 'and do\nyou lead me to a tree; then I will climb up first, and you shall climb up\nafterwards, and so we shall be out of their way.' The Deaf Man thought this\ngood advice, so he pushed the donkey and the bundles of treasure into the\nbushes, and led the Blind Man to a high supari  2 tree that grew close by; but\nhe was a very cunning man, this Deaf Man, and instead of letting the Blind Man\nclimb up first and following him, he got up first and let the Blind Man\nclamber after, so that he was further out of harm's way than his friend.\n\nWhen the Rakshas arrived at the place and saw them both perched out of reach\nin the supari-tree, he said to his friend 'Let us get on each other's\nshoulders; we shall then be high enough to pull them down.' So one Rakshas\nstooped down, at the second got on his shoulders, and the third on his, and ti\nfourth on his, and the fifth on his, and the sixth on his, and ti seventh and\nlast Rakshas (who had invited all the others) was just climbing up, when the\nDeaf Man (who was looking over ti Blind Man's shoulder) got so frightened,\nthat in his alarm I caught hold of his friend's arm, crying, 'They're coming!\nthey're coming!' The Blind Man was not in a very secure position, an was\nsitting at his ease, not knowing how close the Rakshas were. The consequence\nwas, that when the Deaf Man gave him this unexpected push, he lost his balance\nand tumbled down on to neck of the seventh Rakshas, who was just then climbing\nup. The Blind Man had no idea where he was, but thought he had got on to the\nbranch of some other tree; and stretching out his hand for something to catch\nhold of, caught hold of the Raksha two great ears, and pinched them very hard\nin his surprise an fright. The Rakshas couldn't think what it was that had con\ntumbling down upon him; and, the weight of the Blind Ma upsetting his balance,\ndown he also fell to the ground, knocking down in their turn the sixth, fifth,\nfourth, third, second, and first Rakshas, who all rolled one over another, and\nlay in a confused heap together at the foot of the tree. Meanwhile the Blind\nMan called out to his friend, 'Where am I? what has happened Where am I? where\nam I?' The Deaf Man (who was safe up in the tree) answered, 'Well done,\nbrother! never fear! never fear! You're all right, only hold on tight. I'm\ncoming down help you.' But he had not the least intention of leaving his place\nof safety. However, he continued to call out, 'Never mind brother, hold on as\ntight as you can. I'm coming, I 'm coming and the more he called out, the\nharder the Blind Man pinched the Rakshas' ears, which he mistook for some kind\nof palm branches. The six other Rakshas, who had succeeded, after good deal of\nkicking, in extricating themselves from their un-pleasant position, thought\nthey had had quite enough of helping their friend; and ran away as fast as\nthey could; and the seventh, thinking from their going that the danger must be\ngreater than h imagined, and being moreover very much afraid of the mysterious\ncreature that sat on his shoulders, put his hands to the back his ears and\npushed off the Blind Man (as a man would brush away a mosquito); and then,\nwithout staying to see who or what he was, followed his six companions as fast\nas he could.\n\nAs soon as all the Rakshas were out of sight, the Deaf Man came down from the\ntree, and picking up the Blind Man, embraced him, saying, 'I could not have\ndone better myself. You have frightened away all our enemies, but you see I\ncame to help you as fast as possible.' He then dragged the donkey and the\nbundles of treasure out of the bushes, gave the Blind Man one bundle to carry,\ntook the second himself, and put the remaining two on the donkey, as before.\nThis done, the whole party set off to return home. But when they had got\nnearly out of the jungle the Deaf Man said to the Blind Man, 'We are now close\nto the village; but if we take all this treasure home with us, we shall run\ngreat risk of being robbed. I think our best plan would be to divide it\nequally, then you shall take care of your half and I will take care of mine,\nand each one can hide his share here in the jungle, or wherever pleases him\nbest.'--'Very well,' said the Blind Man, 'do you divide what we have in the\nbundles into two equal portions, keeping one-half yourself and giving me the\nother.' But the cunning Deaf Man had no intention of giving up half of the\ntreasure to the Blind Man, so he first took his own bundle of treasure and hid\nit in the bushes, and then he took the two bundles off the donkey, and hid\nthem in the bushes; and he took a good deal of treasure out of the Blind Man's\nbundle, which he also hid. Then, taking the small quantity that remained, he\ndivided it into two equal portions, and placing half before the Blind Man, and\nhalf in front of himself said, 'There, brother, is your share to do what you\nplease with.' The Blind Man put out his hand, but when he felt what a very\nlittle heap of treasure it was, he got very angry, and cried, 'This is not\nfair, you are deceiving me; you have kept almost all the treasure for\nyourself, and only given me a very little.'--' Oh dear! oh dear! how can you\nthink so?' answered the Deaf Man; 'but if you will not believe me, feel for\nyourself. See, my heap of treasure is no larger than yours.' The Blind Man put\nout his hands again to feel how much his friend had kept; but in front of the\nDeaf Man lay only a very small heap, no larger than what he had himself\nreceived. At this he got very cross, and said, 'Come, come, this won't do. You\nthink you can cheat me in this way because I'm blind; but I'm not so stupid as\nall that. I carried a great bundle of treasure; you carried a great bundle of\ntreasure; and there were two great bundles on the donkey. Do you mean to\npretend that all that made no more treasure than these two little heaps? No,\nindeed, I know better.'--' Stuff and nonsense!' answered the Deaf Man. 'You\nare trying to take me in,' continued the other, 'and I won't be taken in by\nyou.'--' No, I 'm not,' said the Deaf Man. 'Yes, you are,' said the Blind Man;\nand so they went on bickering, scolding, growling, contradicting, until the\nBlind Man got so enraged that he gave the Deaf Man a tremendous box on the\near. The blow was so violent that it made the Deaf Man hear! The Deaf Man,\nvery angry, gave his neighbour in return so hard a blow in the face, that it\nopened the Blind Man's eyes!\n\nSo the Deaf Man could hear as well as see! and the Blind Man could see as well\nas hear! This astonished them both so much that they became good friends at\nonce. The Deaf Man confessed to having hidden the bulk of the treasure, which\nhe thereupon dragged forth from its place of concealment, and having divided\nit equally, they went home and enjoyed themselves.\n\n![](img/39.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd22.htm#fr_67) Musical and dancing entertainment.\n\n[2](odd22.htm#fr_68) Areca Catechu. the Betel-nut Palm.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIX.
