 \nThen fierce as He who rules the dead,  \nWhen wroth, on angered Rama sped.  \nBy Dushan cheered, the demons cast  \nTheir dread aside and rallied fast  \nWith Sals, rocks, palm-trees in their hands  \nWith nooses, maces, pikes, and brands,  \nAgain upon the godlike man  \nThe mighty fiends infuriate ran,  \nThese casting rocks like hail, and these  \nA whelming shower of leafy trees.  \nWild, wondrous fight, the eye to scare,  \nAnd raise on end each shuddering hair,  \n\np. 259  \n\nAs with the fiends who loved to rove  \nBy night heroic Rama strove!  \nThe giants in their fury plied  \nRama with darts on every side.  \nThen, by the gathering demons pressed  \nFrom north and south and east and west,  \nBy showers of deadly darts assailed  \nFrom every quarter fiercely hailed,  \nGirt by the foes who swarmed around,  \nHe raised a mighty shout whose sound  \nStruck terror. On the giant crew  \nHis great Gandharva [1](ry224.htm#fn_469) arrow flew.  \nA thousand mortal shafts were rained  \nFrom the orbed bow the hero strained,  \nTill east and west and south and north  \nWere filled with arrows volleyed forth.  \nThey heard the fearful shout: they saw  \nHis mighty hand the bowstring draw,  \nYet could no wounded giant's eye  \nSee the swift storm of arrows fly.  \nStill firm the warrior stood and cast  \nHis deadly missiles thick and fast.  \nDark grew the air with arrowy hail  \nWhich hid the sun as with a veil.  \nFiends wounded, falling, fallen, slain,  \nAll in a moment, spread the plain,  \nAnd thousands scarce alive were left  \nMangled, and gashed, and torn, and cleft.  \nDire was the sight, the plain o'erspread  \nWith trophies of the mangled dead.  \nThere lay, by Rama's missiles rent,  \nFull many a priceless ornament,  \nWith severed limb and broken gem,  \nHauberk and helm and diadem.  \nThere lay the shattered car, the steed,  \nThe elephant of noblest breed,  \nThe splintered spear, the shivered mace,  \nChouris and screens to shade the face.  \nThe giants saw with bitterest pain  \nTheir warriors weltering on the plain,  \nNor dared again his might oppose  \nWho scourged the cities of his foes.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[257:1b](ry222.htm#fr_467) See _Additional Notes_ \\--DAKSHA'S SACRIFICE.\n\n[258:1](ry223.htm#fr_468) Himalaya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXVI.: Dushan's Death.](ry224.htm)\n\n"
