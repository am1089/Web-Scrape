What is Ban\xe1\xb8\x8dha (bondage).\n\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 [the Self] falsely superimposing the body and others which are not-Self\nupon Himself, and identifying Himself with them--this identification forms the\nbondage of the Self.\n\n2\\. What is Moksha [emancipation]?\n\nThe freedom from that [identification] is Moksha.\n\n3\\. What is Avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 (Nescience)?\n\nThat which causes this identification--that indeed is Avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81.\n\n4\\. What is Vi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 (knowledge)?\n\nThat which removes this identification is Vi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81.\n\n5\\. What are (meant by) the states of J\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xad [the waking], Swapna [the\ndreaming], Sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi [the dreamless sleeping] and \xe1\xb9\xacur\xc4\xabya [the fourth]?\n\nJ\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xad is that [state] during which \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 enjoys the gross objects of senses as\nsound, etc., through the 14 organs 2 as Manas, etc., having the sun and the\nrest as their presiding deities.\n\nSwapna is that [state] during which \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 experiences, through the 14 organs\nassociated with the V\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s [affinities],\n\np. 14\n\nof the waking condition, sound and other objects which are of the form of the\nV\xc4\x81san\xc4\x81s created for the time being, even in the absence of [the gross] sound\nand the others. \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 experiences Sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi when it does not experience sound\nand other objects of sense from the cessation of the functions of the 14\norgans, there being no special enjoying consciousness on account of the\nabsence of these organs.\n\n\xe1\xb9\xacur\xc4\xabya is that state during which \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is a witness to the existence of the\nabove-mentioned three states, though it is in itself without (their) existence\nand non-existence and during which it is one uninterrupted Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya\n(consciousness) alone. And that Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya is that which is connected with the\nthree states, which is without the three states, and which is pare.\n\n6\\. What are the Annamaya, Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87amaya, Manomaya, Vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81namaya and \xc4\x80nan\xe1\xb8\x8damaya\nKo\xc5\x9bas (sheaths)?\n\nAnnamaya sheath is the aggregate of the materials formed by food. When the ten\nV\xc4\x81yus (Vital airs), Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as and others, flow through the Annamaya sheath, then\nit is called the Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87amaya sheath. When \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 connected with the above two\nsheaths performs the functions of hearing, etc., through the 14 organs of Man\nas and others, then it is called Manomaya sheath.\n\nWhen in the (Anta\xe1\xb8\xa5-kara\xe1\xb9\x87a) internal organs connected with the above three\nsheaths, there arise the modifications of contemplation, meditation, etc.,\nabout the peculiarities of the sheaths, then it is called Vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81namaya sheath.\n\nWhen the self-cause J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is in its Self-bliss like the banyan tree in its\nseed, though associated with these four sheaths caused by Aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, then it is\ncalled \xc4\x80nan\xe1\xb8\x8damaya sheath. \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 which is associated with the Up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi [vehicle]\nof these sheaths is figuratively called Ko\xc5\x9ba.\n\n7\\. What is meant by Kar\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81 (actor), J\xc4\xabva, Pa\xc3\xb1chavarga [the five groups],\nKshe\xe1\xb9\xadraj\xc3\xb1a (the lord of the place), S\xc4\x81kshi [the witness], K\xc5\xabtas\xe1\xb9\xadha and\nAn\xe1\xb9\xadary\xc4\x81min (the latent guide)?\n\nKar\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81 (the actor) is the one who possesses the body and the internal organs\nthrough their respective desires proceeding from the idea of pleasure and\npain. The idea of pleasure is that modification of the mind known as love. The\nidea of pain is\n\np. 15\n\nthat modification of the mind known as hate. The cause of pleasure and pain\nare sound, touch, form, taste and odour.\n\nJ\xc4\xabva is that A\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81si [deluded one] that thinks that this body, which is\nobtained through the effects of good and bad Karmas, is one not so obtained.\n\nPa\xc3\xb1chavarga (the five groups) are (1) Manas, _viz_., Manas, Bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, Chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada and\nAha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra (creating uncertainty, certitude, flitting thought and egoism), (2)\nPr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, _i.e._ , Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, Ap\xc4\x81na, Vy\xc4\x81na Sam\xc4\x81na and U\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81na, (3) Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadwa, _i.e._ ,\nSa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadwa, Rajas, and \xe1\xb9\xacamas. (4) the [five] elements: earth, water, fire, V\xc4\x81yu\nand \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b and (5) \xe1\xb8\x8charma and its opposite A\xe1\xb8\x8dharma.\n\nThe original Avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 which has the characteristics of the above 5 groups, which\ndoes not perish without \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81-J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, which appears eternal through the presence\nof \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and which is the vehicle for [the manifestation of] \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, is the seed\nof the Li\xe1\xb9\x85ga [subtle] body. It is also called H\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb8\x8daya-gran\xe1\xb9\xadhi [the heart-knot].\n\nThe Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya [consciousness] which is reflected and shines in it is\nKshe\xe1\xb9\xadraj\xc3\xb1a.\n\nS\xc4\x81kshi [the witness] is that conscious one that is aware of the appearance and\ndisappearance [of the three states] of the knower, the knowledge and the\nknown, who is himself without [or not affected by] this appearance and\ndisappearance, and who is self-radiant.\n\nK\xc5\xabtas\xe1\xb9\xadha is he who is found without exception in the Bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi of all creatures\nfrom Brahma down to ants, and who is shining as \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and dwells as witness to\nthe Bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi of all creatures.\n\nAn\xe1\xb9\xadary\xc4\x81min is the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 that shines as the ordainer, being within all bodies\nlike the thread [on which] beads [are strung] and serving to know the cause of\nthe several differences of K\xc5\xabtas\xe1\xb9\xadha and others associated with him.\n\n8\\. Who is Pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81?\n\nHe is of the nature of truth, wisdom, eternity and bliss. He has no vehicles\nof body. He is abstract wisdom itself, like a mass of pure gold that is devoid\nof the changes of bracelet, crown, etc. He is of the nature of mere\nconsciousness. He is that which shines as Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya and Brahman. When He is\n\np. 16\n\nsubject to the vehicle of Avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 and is the meaning of the word "\xe1\xb9\xacwam" (\'Thou\'\nin "\xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadwamasi"), then He is Pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81.\n\n9\\. Who is Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81?\n\nIt is He who is associated with truth, wisdom, eternity, bliss, omniscience,\netc., who is subject to the vehicle of M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 and who is the meaning of the word\n"\xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad" (or \'That\' in "\xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadwamasi").\n\n10\\. What is Brahman?\n\nBrahman is that which is free from all vehicles, which is the Absolute\nConsciousness devoid of particularities, which is Sa\xe1\xb9\xad (Be-ness), which is\nwithout a second, which is bliss and which is M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81-less. It is different from\ncharacteristics of that expressed by the word "\xe1\xb9\xacwam" (Thou) subject to Up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhis\n(vehicles), or the characteristics of \'That\' expressed by the word "\xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad"\nsubject to Up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhis. It is itself differenceless and is seen as the Seat of\neverything. It is the pure, the noumenal, the true and the indestructible.\n\nAnd what is Sa\xe1\xb9\xadya (the true)?\n\nIt is the Sa\xe1\xb9\xad (Be-ness) which is the aim pointed out by the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. It is that\nwhich cannot be said to be Asa\xe1\xb9\xad (not-Be-ness). It is that which is not\naffected by the three periods of time. It is that which continues to exist\nduring the three periods of time. It is that which is. It is one without a\nsecond. It has not the differences of similarity or dissimilarity; or it is\nthat which is the source of all ideas. It is that which does not perish even\nthough space, time, matter, cause, etc., perish.\n\nAnd what is J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na (wisdom)?\n\nIt is self-light. It is that which illuminates all. It is that Absolute\nConsciousness which is without any obscuration. It is that Consciousness which\nhas no beginning or end, which is perpetual and which is the witness to all\nmodifications and their opposites.\n\nAnd what is Anan\xe1\xb9\xada (the eternal)?\n\nIt is that which is without origin and destruction. It is that which is not\nsubject to the six changes ( _viz_., birth, growth, manhood, decay, old age\nand death). It is free from all Up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhis. It is that Consciousness which, being\nall full and without\n\np. 17\n\ndestruction, permeates the created universe composed of Avyak\xe1\xb9\xada and others,\nlike the earth in the modifications of clay, the gold in the modifications of\ngold, and thread in the modifications of thread.\n\nAnd what is \xc4\x80nan\xe1\xb8\x8da (bliss)?\n\nIt is the seat of all sentient beings, like the ocean of the water, is\neternal, pure, partless and non-dual, and is the sole essence of Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da\n(consciousness-bliss).\n\n11\\. Of how many kinds are substances?\n\nThere are three kinds, Sa\xe1\xb9\xad (Be-ness), Asa\xe1\xb9\xad (not-Be-ness) and Mi\xe1\xb9\xadhy\xc4\x81\n(Illusion).\n\nSa\xe1\xb9\xad alone is Brahman. Asa\xe1\xb9\xad is that which is not. Mi\xe1\xb9\xadhy\xc4\x81 is the illusory\nascription to Brahman of the universe that is not.\n\nWhat is fit to be known is Brahman, the \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 alone.\n\nBrahma-J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is the rooting out of all--bodies and such like--that are not\nSelf, and the merging in Brahman, the Sa\xe1\xb9\xad. The universe of \xc4\x80k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b and others\nincluding J\xc4\xabva is not-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81.\n\n12\\. What is M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81?\n\nThe root of this not-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81. She appears in Brahman like clouds, etc.,\nin the sky. She has no beginning but has an end. She is subject to proof and\nnot-proof. She neither is; nor is not; nor is she a combination of both (Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\nand Asa\xe1\xb9\xad). Her seat is indescribable. She has the varieties of differences as\nextolled by the wise. It is she that truly is not. Her nature is Aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na. She\nappears as M\xc5\xablaprak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi, Gu\xe1\xb9\x87a-S\xc4\x81mya (a state where the three Gu\xe1\xb9\x87as are found in\nequilibrium), 1 Avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 (Nescience) and other forms, transforming herself into\nthe form of the universe. Thus does a knower of Brahman cognize her.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[13:1](tmu04.htm#fr_1) This Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d and the next form a glossary of some of\nthe terms of Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada. \'Sarva-S\xc4\x81ra\' is the all-essence or quintessence.\n\n[13:2](tmu04.htm#fr_2) They are the 5 organs of sense, the 5 organs of action\nand the 4 of An\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb8\xa5-kara\xe1\xb9\x87a (the internal organ), _viz_., Manas, Bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, China\nand Aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra. Each is animated by a \xe1\xb8\x8ceva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81 or intelligential principle.\n\n[17:1](tmu04.htm#fr_3) This refers to that slumbering or latent state of the\nuniverse--called also Mah\xc4\x81-Sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi when the Gu\xe1\xb9\x87as are in equilibrium; on re-\nawakening into activity when the Gu\xe1\xb9\x87as are disturbed, M\xc5\xablaprak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi is called by\nthe different names of M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81, Avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81, \xe1\xb9\xacamas, etc.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 3.
