Vyasa said :-- O King! Once on a time, the time for A _st_ aka S'raddha\n(the funeral ceremony in honour of the departed) arrived. Seeing this, the\nKing Ik _s_ aku ordered his son Vikuk _s_ i :-- \xc2\x93O Child! Go immediately to\nthe forest and bring carefully pure sanctified meat for the\n\n\n\np. 623\n\n\n\nS'raddha purposes; see, that there be no neglect of duty.\xc2\x94 Thus ordered, Vikuk\n_s_ i instantly went to the forest equipped with arms. He hunted in the forest\nlots of boars, pigs, deer, and hare. But he was so very tired with his journey\nin the forest and got so hungry that he forgot everything about the A _st_ aka\nS'raddha and ate one hare there in the forest. The remaining excellent meat he\nbrought and handed over to his father. When that meat was brought to be\nsprinkled for purification, the family priest Vas'i _st_ ha, on seeing it, at\nonce came to know that some portion had already been eaten and it was the\nremaining part. The leavings of food are not fit for the sprinkling purposes;\nthis is the S'astric rule. Vas'i _st_ ha informed the King of this defect in\nthe food. In accordance with the Guru's advice, the King coming to know thus\nthe violation of the rule by his son, became very angry and banished his son\nfrom his kingdom. The prince became known from that time as Sa'sada; he did\nnot become the least sorry for his father's anger; he went to the forest and\ngladly remained there. He gladly passed his time absorbed in religion and\nsustained his life on forest fruits and roots. After sometime when his father\ndied, he inherited his kingdom. On becoming the King of Ayodhya, S'as'ada had\nonly one son; he became famous in the three lokas by the name of Kakutstha. He\nwas known also by other names Indravaha and Puranjaya.\n\n\n\n12\\. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Holy One! How and why was the prince named\nKakutstha. Why was he known by the two other names? Speak all this to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n13-14. Vyasa said :-- O King! When S'as'ada went to the Heavens Kakutstha\nbecame king. That religious king then began to govern the country of his\nfather and grandfather with an authority supported by a powerful arm. At this\ntime the Devas suffered a defeat from the Danavas and took refuge to Vi _sn_\nu, the Infallible and the Lord of the three worlds. The eternal great Vi _sn_\nu full of intelligence and bliss then addressed the Devas :--\n\n\n\n15-16. Vi _sn_ u said :-- \xc2\x93O Devas! Go and pray to the King S'as'ada. He will\nbe your ally and kill all the Demons. That King is religious; especially he is\na worshipper of the Highest S'akti. He is a good archer and will come to help\nyou. His strength is immense.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n17-18. Vyasa said :-- O King! Indra and the other Devas hearing the nectar\nlike words of Hari went to Ayodhya, to Kakutstha, the son of S'as'ada. Seeing\nthe Devas at his palace, the king worshipped them duly and with great care and\nhe asked them why they had come there.\n\n\n\n19-20. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Devas! When you have favoured me by your presence\nhere, I am blessed and sanctified; my life is crowned\n\n\n\np. 624\n\n\n\nwith success. Say what I can do for you; I will carry it out even if it be\nvery hard for me to perform.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n21-22. The Devas said :-- \xc2\x93O Prince! Please help and back us and defeat the\nDaityas, invincible by the Devas and form an alliance with Indra. O King! By\nthe grace of the Highest S'akti, you have nothing unattained anywhere; so we\nhave come to you by the order of Vi _sn_ u.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n23-41. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Devas! I can back you and become your ally if\nIndra carries me on his back in the time of war. I will fight now with the\nDaityas for the Devas; but I will go to the battle-field on Indra's back; this\nI speak to you truly.\xc2\x94 Vyasa said :-- O King! The Devas then spoke to Indra\n:-- \xc2\x93O Lord of S'achi! It is now your bounden duty to do this; so quitting\nshame, be a carrier to this King.\xc2\x94 Indra got ashamed very much, but being\nrequested frequently by Hari, at last assumed the appearance of a bull like\nthe great Bull of S'iva. The King mounted on that bull to go to the war; he\nfought while taking his seat on the hump on the shoulders of the bull (Kakud);\ntherefore he was named Kakutstha. The King was carried by Indra on his back\nhence he was named Indravaha; he conquered the Danavas in battle; hence he was\ncalled Puranjaya. The powerful King defeated the Danavas and gave away all\ntheir wealth to the Devas. He bade farewell to the Devas and returned to his\nown kingdom. Thus the alliance was formed with Indra. O King! Kakutstha became\nvery celebrated on this earth; his descendants became kings and were known as\nKakutsthas and were all very famous here on this Earth. Kakutstha had one\npowerful son, named Kakutstha by his legal wife; Kakutstha had the son Prithu,\nof mighty prowess. Prithu was the part incarnation personified of Vi _sn_ u,\nand worshipper of the feet of the Supreme S'akti. His son was Visvarandhi; he\nbecame king and governed the kingdom. His son was Chandra; he came to be king,\ngoverned his subjects and multiplied very much his issues. Yuvanas'va was one\nof his sons; he was very powerful and spirited. S'avanta was the son of\nYuvanas'va; he was very religious. He built a nice city named S'avanti like\nthe Paradise of Indra. Brihadas'va was the son of the high-souled S'avanta; he\nhad a son Kuvalayas'va. He became the Lord of the earth by the power of his\narms. He killed Dhundu Danava; so he was very much celebrated by the name of\nDhundumara. His son was Dridhas'va; he governed the earth; His son was S'riman\nHaryas'va. His son was Nikumbha; he became the King. Nikumbha had his son\nVarha _n_ as'va. Kris'as'va was his son. His son was the powerful Parasenajit;\nhis son's prowess knew no bounds. Parasenajit had the fortunate son\nYauvanas'va. O fortunate One! The son of Yauvanas'va was S'riman Mandhata; he\nbecame the Lord of the Earth and for the\n\n\n\np. 625\n\n\n\nsatisfaction of the Devi Bhagavati had one thousand and eight palaces built in\nBenares and in the other chief places of pilgrimages. Maudhata was not born of\nhis mother's womb but was born in the belly of his father. Then the ministers\ntore asunder the belly of his father and got him out.\n\n\n\n42-43. Janamejaya said :-- O fortunate One! What you said was never seen nor\nheard ever before since. This sort of birth is highly improbable. How was that\nbeautiful son born in the belly of his father? Describe this in detail and\nsatisfy my curiosity.\n\n\n\n44-49. Vyasa said :-- O King! The King Yauvanas'va had one hundred queens; yet\nhe had no issues. The King always thought much about his son. Once the King,\nsorry and desirous of a son, went to the holy retreats of the Ri _s_ is. On\narriving there, he began frequently to respire heavily before the ascetics.\nThe Ri _s_ is became filled with pity on seeing his sorrowful condition. O\nKing! The Brahmi _n_ s that said to him :-- O King! Why are you thus sorrowful\nand distressed? What is your sorrow that is troubling your heart? Speak truly.\nWe will surely redress your grievance.\n\n\n\n50-54. Yauvanas'va said :-- \xc2\x93O Munis! I have got the kingdom wealth, excellent\nhorses, one hundred illustrious chaste wives. I have no enemies in the three\nworlds; no one is stronger than me. All the Kings and ministers are obedient\nto my call. But O Ascetics! I have no son; this my sonless state is the only\ncause of my pain and sorrow. It has marred all my happiness. See! The persons\nthat have no son cannot in any way go to Heavens. Therefore I am always being\npained for this. You all are ascetics; you have taken great pains to learn the\nessence of the Veda S'astras. So kindly order me what sacrifice is fit for me\nto have a son. O Ascetics! If you feel any pity for me, kindly perform this\ngood work for me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n55-65. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing the words of the King they were all\nfilled with pity; and, with fulness of mind, made him to perform the sacrifice\nwhose presiding deity was Indra. For the sake of the King, that he may get a\nson born to him, they had a jar filled with water by the Brahmi _n_ s and\npurified and charged that jar with the Vedic Mantrams. The King got thirsty in\nthe night and entered in the sacrificial ground; seeing the Brahmi _n_ s\nasleep, the King himself drank that water, surcharged with the Mantram. The\nBrahmi _n_ s consecrated and kept that water apart, according to due rules,\nsurcharging with Mantrams, for the wife of the King; but the King, getting\nthirsty, himself drank that water unconsciously. Next morning the Brahmi _n_ s\n\n\n\np. 626\n\n\n\nseeing the jar of water empty, were startled very much with fear; the Brahmi\n_n_ s then asked the King :-- Who drank the water? When they came to know that\nthe King himself drank the water, the Munis thought this to he an act of Daiva\n(Fate) and completing the sacrifice returned to their abodes. Then the King\nbecame pregnant by the power of the sacrificial Mantrams. After some time, the\nson became fully developed. Then the King's ministers, cutting his right\nbowel, got the son out. Out of the God's favour, the King did not die. When\nthe ministers were troubled with the thought whose milk the child will suck,\nthen Indra spoke out the child would drink (Man-Dhata) my forefinger and gave\nhis finger into the child's mouth. For that reason his name was Mandhata. Thus\nI have described in detail the origin of Mandhata.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Ninth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the story of Kakutstha and\nthe origin of Mandhata in S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam the Maha Pura _n_ am, of\n18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 10](bk07ch10.htm)\n\n"
