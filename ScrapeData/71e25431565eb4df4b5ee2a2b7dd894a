I now describe the Stotra (hymn) of\nSarasvati Devi, yielding, all desires that Yaj\xc3\xb1avalkya, the best of the Ri _s_\nis recited in days of yore to Her. The Muni Yaj\xc3\xb1avalkya forgot all the Vedas\nout of the curse of Guru and with a very sad heart went to the Sun, the great\nmerit-giving place. There he practised austerities for a time when the\nLolakhya Sun became visible to him, when, being overpowered by great sorrow,\nhe began to cry repeatedly; and then he sang hymns to him. Then Bhagavan Surya\nDeva became pleased and taught him all the Vedas with their Amgas (limbs) and\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93O Child! Now sing hymns to Sarasvati Devi that you get back your\nmemory.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the Sun disappeared. The Muni Yaj\xc3\xb1avalkya finished his\nbath and with his heart full of devotion began to sing hymns to the Vag Devi,\nthe Goddess of Speech.\n\n\n\n6-32. Yaj\xc3\xb1avalkya said :-- \xc2\x93Mother! Have mercy on me. By Guru's curse, my\nmemory is lost; I am now void of learning and have become powerless; my sorrow\nknows no bounds. Give me knowledge, learning, memory, power to impart\nknowledge to disciples, power to compose books, and also good disciples\nendowed with genius and Pratibha (ready wit). So that in the council of good\nand learned men my intelligence and power of argument and judgment be fully\nknown. Whatever I lost by my bad luck, let all that come back to my heart and\nbe renewed as if the sprouts come again out of the heaps of ashes. O Mother!\nThou art of the nature of Brahma, superior to all; Thou art of the nature of\nLight, Eternal; Thou art the presiding Deity of all the branches of learning.\nSo I bow down again and again to Thee. O Mother! The letters Anusvara, Vi _s_\narga and Chandravindu that are affixed, Thou art those letters. So obeisance\nto Thee! O Mother! Thou art the exposition (Vyakhya) of the S'astras; Thou art\nthe\n\n\n\np. 825\n\n\n\npresiding Deity of all the expositions and annotations. Without Thee no\nmathematician can count anything. So Thou art the numbers to count time; Thou\nart the S'akti by which Siddhantas (definite conclusions) are arrived at; Thus\nThou dost remove the errors of men. So again and again obeisance to Thee. O\nMother! Thou art the S'akti, memory, knowledge, intelligence, Pratibha, and\nimagination (Kalpana). So I bow down again and again to Thee. Sanatkumara fell\ninto error and asked Brahma for solution. He became unable to solve the\ndifficulties and remained speechless like a dumb person. Then S'ri Kri _sn_ a,\nthe Highest Self arriving there, said :-- O Prajapati! Better praise and sing\nhymns to the Goddess of speech; then your desires will be fulfilled. Then the\nfour-faced Brahma advised by the Lord, praised the Devi Sarasvati; and, by Her\ngrace, arrived at a very nice Siddhanta (conclusion). One day the goddess\nEarth questioned one doubt of Her to Ananta Deva, when He being unable to\nanswer, remained silent like a dumb person. At last He became afraid; and\nadvised by Kas'yapa, praised Thee when He resolved the doubt and came to a\ndefinite conclusion. Veda Vyasa once went to Valmiki and asked him about some\nSutras of the Pura _n_ as when the Muni Valmiki got confounded and remembered\nThee, the Mother of the world. When by Thy Grace, the Light flashed within him\nand his error vanished. Thereby he became able to solve the question. Then\nVyasadeva, born of the parts of S'ri Kri _sn_ a, heard about the Pura _n_ a\nSutras from Valmiki's mouth and came to know about Thy glory. He then went to\nPu _s_ kara Tirtha and became engaged in worshipping Thee, the Giver of Peace,\nfor one hundred years. Then Thou didst become pleased and grant him the boon\nwhen he ascended to the rank of the Kavindra (Indra amongst the poets). He\nthen made the classification of the Vedas and composed the eighteen Pura _n_\nas. When Sada S'iva was questioned on some spiritual knowledge by Mahendra, He\nthought of Thee for a moment and then answered. Once Indra asked Brihaspati,\nthe Guru of the Devas, about S'abda S'astra (Scriptures on sound). He became\nunable to give any answer. So he went to Pu _s_ kara Tirtha and worshipped\nThee for a thousand years according to the Deva Measure and he became\nafterwards able to give instructions on S'abda S'astra for one thousand divine\nyears to Mahendra. O Sures'vari! Those Munis that give education to their\ndisciples or those that commence their own studies remember Thee before they\ncommence their works respectively. The Munindras, Manus, men, Dai _t_ yendras,\nand Immortals, Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes\xc2\x92a all worship Thee and Sing hymns\nto Thee. Vi _sn_ u ultimately becomes inert when He goes on praising Thee by\nHis thousand mouths. So Maha Deva becomes when\n\n\n\np. 826\n\n\n\nhe praises by His five mouths; and so Brahma by His four mouths. When great\npersonages so desist, then what to speak of me, who is an ordinary mortal\nhaving one mouth only!\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the Mahar _s_ i Yaj\xc3\xb1avalkya, who had\nobserved fasting, bowed down to the Devi Sarasvati with great devotion and\nbegan to cry frequently. Then the Mahamaya Sarasvati, of the nature of Light\ncould not hide Herself away. She became visible to him and said \xc2\x93O Child! You\nbe good Kavindra (Indra of the poets).\xc2\x94 Granting him this boon, She went to\nVaiku _nt_ ha. He becomes a good poet, eloquent, and intelligent like\nBrihaspati who reads this stotra of Sarasvati by Yaj\xc3\xb1avalkya. Even if a great\nilliterate reads this Sarasvati stotra for one year, he becomes easily a good\nPundit, intelligent, and a good poet.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifth Chapter of the Ninth Book on Sarasvati stotra by\nYaj\xc3\xb1avalkya in S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 6](bk09ch06.htm)\n\n"
