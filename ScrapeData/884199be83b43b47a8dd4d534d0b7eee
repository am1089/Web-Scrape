Naraya _n_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Narada! Sarasvati lives always in Vaiku _nt_ ha\nclose to Narada. One day a quarrel arose with Ganga, and by Her curse,\nSarasvati came in parts as a river here in this Bharata. She is reckoned in\nBharata as a great sanctifiying holy and merit-giving river. The good persons\nserve Her always, residing on Her banks. She is the Tapasya and the fruit\nthereof of the ascetics. She is like the burning fire to the sins of the\nsinners. Those that die in Bharata on the Sarasvati waters with their full\nconsciousness, live for ever in Vaiku _nt_ ha in the council of Hari. Those\nthat bathe in the Sarasvati waters, after committing sins, become easily freed\nof them and live for a long, long time in Vi _sn_ u-Loka. If one bathes even\nonce in the Sarasvati waters, during Chaturmasya (a vow that lasts four\nmonths), in full moon time, in Ak _s_ yaya or when the day ends, in Vyatipata\nYoga, in the time of eclipse or on any other holy day or through any other\nconcomitant cause or even without any faith and out of sheer disregard, one is\nable to go to Vaiku _nt_ ha and get the nature of S\xc2\x92ri Hari. If one repeats\nthe Sarasvati Mantra, residing on the banks of the Sarasvati, for one month, a\ngreat illiterate can become a great poet. There is no doubt in this. Once\nshaving one's head, if one resides on the banks of the Sarasvati, daily bathes\nin it, one will have not to meet with the pain of being again born in the\nwomb. O Narada! Thus I have described a little of the unbounded glories of\nBharata that give happiness and the fruits of all desires.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 827\n\n\n\n11\\. Suta said :-- \xc2\x93O Saunaka! The Muni Narada hearing thus, asked again at\nthat very moment to solve his doubts. I am now speaking of that. Hear.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n12-15. Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! How did the Devi Sarasvati quarrel with the\nDevi Ganga and how did she by Her curse turn out in India, into a holy river\nin giving virtues. I am becoming more and more eager and impatient to hear\nabout this critical incident. I do not find satiety in drinking your nectar-\nlike words. Who finds satiety in getting his good weal? Why did Ganga curse\nSarasvati, worshipped everywhere. Ganga is also full of Sattva Gu _n_ as. She\nalways bestows good and virtue to all. Both of them are fiery and it is\npleasant to hear the cause of quarrels between those two. These are very\nrarely found in the Pura _n_ as. So you ought to describe that to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n16-21. Naraya _n_ a said :-- Hear, O Narada! I will now describe that\nincident, the hearing of which removes all the sins. Lak _s_ mi, Sarasvati and\nGanga, the three wives of Hari and all equally loved, remain always close to\nHari. One day Ganga cast side-long glances frequently towards Naraya _n_ a and\nwas eagerly looking at Him, with smile on Her lips. Seeing this, the Lord\nNarayana, startled and looked at Ganga and smiled also. Lak _s_ mi saw that,\nbut she did not take any offence. But Sarasvati became very angry. Padma (Lak\n_s_ mi) who was of Sattva Gu _n_ a, began to console in various ways the\nwrathful Sarasvati; but she could not be appeased by any means. Rather Her\nface became red out of anger; she began to tremble out of her feelings\n(passion); Her lips quivered; and She began to speak to Her husband.\n\n\n\n22-38. The husband that is good, religious, and well qualified looks on his\nall the wives equally; but it is just the opposite with him who is a cheat. O\nGadadhara! You are partial to Ganga; and so is the case with Lak _s_ mi. I am\nthe only one that is deprived of your love. It is, therefore, that Ganga and\nPadma are in love with each other; for you love Padma. So why shall not Padma\nbear this contrary thing! I am only unfortunate. What use is there in holding\nmy life? Her life is useless, who is deprived of her husband's love. Those\nthat declare you, of Sattva Gu _n_ as, ought not to be ever called Pundits.\nThey are quite illiterate; they have not the least knowledge of the Vedas.\nThey are quite impotent to understand the nature of your mind. O Narada!\nHearing Sarasvati's words and knowing that she had become very angry, Naraya\n_n_ a thought for a moment and then went away from the Zenana outside. When\nNaraya _n_ a had thus gone away, Sarasvati became fearless and began to abuse\nGanga downright out of anger in an abusive language, hard to hear :-- \xc2\x93O\nShameless One! O Passionate One! What\n\n\n\np. 828\n\n\n\npride do you feel for your husband? Do you like to show that your husband\nloves you much? I will destroy your pride today. I will see today, it will be\nseen by others also, what your Hari can do for you?\xc2\x94 Saying thus Sarasvati\nrose up to catch hold of Ganga by Her hairs violently. Padma intervened to\nstop this. Sarasvati became very violent and cursed Lak _s_ mi :-- \xc2\x93No doubt\nyou will be turned into a tree and into a river. In as much as seeing this\nundue behaviour of Ganga, you do not step forward to speak anything in this\nassembly, as if you are a tree or a river.\xc2\x94 Padma did not become at all angry,\neven when she heard of the above curse. She became sorry and, holding the\nhands of Sarasvati, remained silent. Then Ganga became very angry; Her lips\nbegan to quiver frequently. Seeing the mad fiery nature of the red-eyed\nSarasvati, she told Laksmi :-- \xc2\x93O Padme! Leave that wicked foul-mouthed woman.\nWhat will she do to me? She presides over speech and therefore likes always to\nremain with quarrels. Let Her shew Her force how far can she quarrel with me.\nShe wants to test the strength of us. So leave Her. Let all know today our\nstrength and prowess.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n39-44. Thus saying, Ganga became ready to curse Sarasvati and addressing Lak\n_s_ mi, said :-- \xc2\x93O Dear Padme! As that woman has cursed you to become a\nriver, so I too curse her, that she, too, be turned into a river and she would\ngo to the abode of men, the sinners, to the world and take their heaps of\nsins.\xc2\x94 Hearing this curse of Ganga, Sarasvati gave her curse, \xc2\x93You, too, will\nhave to descend into the Bhurloka (the world) as a river, taking all the sins\nof the sinners.\xc2\x94 O Narada! While there was going on this quarrel, the four-\narmed omniscient Bhagavan Hari came up there accompanied by four attendants of\nHis, all four-armed, and took Sarasvati in His breast and began to speak all\nthe previous mysteries. Then they came to know the cause of their quarrels and\nwhy they cursed one another and all became very sorry. At that time Bhagavan\nHari told them one by one :--\n\n\n\n45-67. O Lak _s_ mi! Let you be born in parts, without being born in any womb,\nin the world as the daughter in the house of the King Dharma-dhvaja. You will\nhave to take the form of a tree there, out of this evil turn of fate. There\nS'ankhachu _d_ a, the Indra of the Asuras, born of my parts will marry you.\nAfter that you will come back here and be my wife as now. There is no doubt in\nthis. You will be named Tulasi, the purifier of the three worlds, in Bharata.\nO Beautiful One! Now go there quickly and be a river in your parts under the\nname Padmavati. O Gange! You will also have to take incarnation in Bharata as\na river, purifying all the worlds, to destroy the sins of\n\n\n\np. 829\n\n\n\nthe inhabitants of Bharata. Bhagiratha will take you there after much\nentreating and worshipping you; and you will be famous by the name Bhagirathi,\nthe most sanctifying river in the world. There, the Ocean born of my parts,\nand the King S'antanu also born of my parts will be your husbands. O Bharati!\nLet you go also and incarnate in part in Bharata under the curse of Ganga. O\nGood-natured One! Now go in full Amsas to Brahma and become His wife. Let\nGanga go also in Her fullness to S'iva. Let Padma remain with Me. Padma is of\na peaceful nature, void of anger, devoted to Me and of a Sattvika nature.\nChaste, good-natured, fortunate, and religious woman like Padma are very rare.\nThose women that are born of the parts of Padma are all very religious and\ndevoted to their husbands. They are peaceful and good-natured and worshipped\nin every universe. It is forbidden, nay, opposed to the Vedas, to keep three\nwives, three servants, three friends of different natures, at one place. They\nnever conduce to any welfare. They are the fruitful sources of all jealousies\nand quarrels. Where, in any family females are powerful like men and males are\nsubmissive to females, the birth of the male is useless. At his every step, he\nmeets with difficulties and bitter experiences. He ought to retire to the\nforest whose wife is foul-mouthed, of bad birth and fond of quarrels. The\ngreat forest is better for him than his house. That man does not get in his\nhouse any water for washing his feet, or any seat to sit on, or any fruit to\neat, nothing whatsoever; but in the forest, all these are not unavailable.\nRather to dwell amidst rapacious animals or to enter into fire than remain\nwith a bad wife. O Fair One! Rather the pains of the disease or venom are\nbearable, but the words of a bad wife are hard to bear. Death is far better\nthan that. Those that are under the control of their wives, know that they\nnever get their peace of mind until they are laid on their funeral pyres. They\nnever see the fruits of what they daily do. They have no fame anywhere,\nneither in this world nor in the next. Ultimately the fruit is this:-- that\nthey have to go to hell and remain there. His life is verily a heavy burden\nwho is without any name or fame. Never it is for the least good that many co-\nwives remain at one place. When, by taking one wife only a man does not become\nhappy, then imagine, how painful it becomes to have many wives. O Gange! Go to\nS'iva. O Sarasvati! Go to Brahma. Let the good-natured Kamala, residing on the\nlotus remain with Me. He gets in this world happiness and Dharma and in the\nnext Mukti whose wife is chaste and obedient. In fact he is Mukta, pure and\nhappy whose wife is chaste; and he whose wife is foul-natured, is rendered\nimpure unhappy and dead whilst he is living.\n\n\n\np. 830\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the coming in this world of\nLak _s_ mi, Ganga and Sarasvati in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 7](bk09ch07.htm)\n\n"
