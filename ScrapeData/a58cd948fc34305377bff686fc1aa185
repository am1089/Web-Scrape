The choice of the bride is succeeded by the (ceremony of) joining the bride and bridegroom's hands. Thus the ceremony (of marriage) is twofold.\n\n3. 3 Of these two parts (of the marriage ceremony) the choice of the bride is declared to lose its binding force, when a blemish is (subsequently) discovered (in either of the two parties). The Mantra (prayer), which is recited during the ceremony of joining the bride and bridegroom's hands, is the permanent token of matrimony.\n\n4. 4 When a Brahman, Kshatriya, Vai _s_ ya, or _S_ udra takes a wife, it is best for him to take her out of his own caste; and so is a member of her own caste the (most eligible) husband for a woman (of any caste).\n\n5. 5 A Brahman may marry three wives of different caste, in the direct order of the castes; and so may\n\np. 166\n\na _S_ udra woman take a husband of any of the three castes above her own.\n\n6. 6 For a Kshatriya, two wives differing (from him) in caste are permitted; for a Vai _s_ ya, a single wife differing (from him) in caste. (On the other hand), a Vai _s_ ya woman may take a husband of two different castes; and a Kshatriya woman may take a husband of one different caste.\n\n7. 7 Sagotras and Samanapravaras are ineligible for marriage up to the fifth and seventh degrees of relationship respectively, on the father's and mother's side.\n\n* 8. 8 The man must undergo an examination with regard to his virile; when the fact of his virile has been placed beyond doubt, he shall obtain the maiden, (but not otherwise.)\n\n* 9. 9 If his collar-bone, his knee, and his bones (in\n\np. 167\n\ngeneral) are strongly made; if his shoulders and his hair are (also) strongly\nmade; if the nape of his neck is stout, and his thigh and his skin delicate;\nif his gait and his voice is vigorous;\n\n* 10. 10 If his semen, when thrown into water, does not swim on the surface; and if his urine is rich and foamy: by these tokens may a potent man be known; and one impotent by the opposite characteristics.\n\n* 11. Fourteen species of impotent men are distinguished by the sages, according to the rules of science, including both the curable and incurable. The rules regarding them shall be given in order.\n\n* 12. 12 One naturally impotent, one whose testicles have been cut out, a Pakshasha _n_ _dh_ a, one who has been deprived of his potency by a curse of his spiritual guide, or by illness, or by the wrath of a deity,\n\n* 13. 13 One jealous, a Sevya, one whose semen is (evanescent) as air, a Mukhebhaga, one who spills\n\np. 168\n\nhis semen, one whose semen is devoid of strength, one timorous, and one who is\npotent with another woman (than his wife) only, (these are the fourteen sorts\nof impotent persons.)\n\n* 14. Among these, the two first are incurable; the one called Pakshasha _n_ _dh_ a should wait for a month; the (three) named after him shall have to wait for a year.\n\n* 15. 15 Those four, among whom, in the above enumeration, the one jealous comes first, shall be avoided by their wives just like an outcast, though they may have been enjoyed by them.\n\n* 16. For the wife of one who spills his semen, or whose semen is devoid of strength, though they may have discharged their marital duties, another husband must be procured, after she has waited for half a year.\n\n* 17. If a man is timorous, he fails when he is about\n\np. 169\n\nto approach his wife; such a feeble man shall be stirred up by bringing before\nhim other men's wives or young maidens, &c.\n\n* 18. If a man is potent with another woman but impotent with his own wife, his wife shall take another husband. This is a law promulgated by the Creator of the world.\n\n19\\. Women have been created for the sake of propagation, the wife being the\nfield, and the husband the giver of the seed. The field must be given to him\nwho has seed. He who has no seed is unworthy to possess the field.\n\n20. 20 Let a maiden be given in marriage by her father himself, or by her brother with the father's authority, or by her paternal grandfather, or by her maternal uncle, or by her agnates or cognates.\n\n21\\. In default of all these, by the mother, in case she is competent (to act\nas guardian); if she be wanting in competence, the distant connexions shall\ngive a maiden in marriage.\n\n22. 22 If no such person be in existence, let the maiden have recourse to the king, and let her, with his permission, betake herself to a bridegroom of her own choice,\n\np. 170\n\n23\\. Who belongs to her own caste, and is a suitable match in point of\ndescent, morality, age, and sacred learning. Let her discharge her religious\nduties in common with him, and bear children to him.\n\n24. 24 When a bridegroom goes abroad after having espoused a maiden, let the maiden wait till her menses have passed three times, and then choose another bridegroom.\n\n25. 25 Let no maiden suffer the period of maturity to come on without giving notice of it to her relations. Should they omit to give her in marriage, they would be equal to the murderers of an embryo.\n\n26. 26 He who does not give such a maiden in marriage commits the crime of killing an embryo as many times as her period of menstruation passes by without her having a husband.\n\n27. 27 Therefore a father must give his daughter in marriage once (for all), as soon as the signs of maturity become apparent. (By acting) otherwise he would commit a heavy crime. Such is the rule settled among the virtuous.\n\np. 171\n\n28. 28 Once is the (family) property divided, once is a maiden given in marriage, and once does a man say, 'I will give;' each of these three acts is done a single time only among the virtuous.\n\n29. 29 This rule applies to the five (first) marriage forms only, beginning with the Brahma (form of marriage). In the three (others), beginning with the \xc3\x82sura form, the (irrevocable) gift (of a maiden to a particular suitor) depends on the qualities (of the suitor).\n\n30. 30 Should a more respectable suitor, (who appears) eligible in point of religious merit, fortune, and amiability, present himself, when the nuptial gift has already been presented (to the parents by the first\n\np. 172\n\nsuitor), the verbal engagement (previously made) shall be annulled.\n\n31. 31 Let no man calumniate a faultless maiden, neither must one calumniate a faultless suitor. When, however, there is an actual defect, it is no offence if they dissolve their mutual engagement.\n\n32. 32 When a man, after having made a solemn promise of giving his daughter in marriage to a certain suitor, does not deliver her afterwards, he shall be punished by the king like a thief, in case the suitor be faultless.\n\n33. 33 But when a man gives a maiden in marriage, who has a (secret) blemish without first making (the defect) known, the king shall visit him with punishment of the very gravest kind.\n\n34. 34 When a man, from hatred, declares a certain maiden to have lost her virginity, he shall pay one hundred Pa _n_ as as a fine, unless he be able to give proofs of her disgrace.\n\n* 35. 35 When a man, after having plighted his faith to a maiden, abandons her, although she is faultless, he shall be fined and shall marry the maiden, even against his will.\n\n36. 36 Affliction with a chronic or hateful disease,\n\np. 173\n\ndeformity, the loss of her virginity, a blemish, and proved intercourse with\nanother man: these are declared to be the faults of a maiden.\n\n37. 37 Madness, loss of caste, impotency, misery, to have forsaken his relatives, and the two first faults of a maiden (in the above text): these are the faults of a suitor.\n\n38. 38 Eight nuptial rites have been ordained for the (four) castes, by which wedlock may be entered into. The Brahma form is the first of these, the Pra _g_ apatya form is the second.\n\n39\\. The \xc3\x82rsha, Daiva, Gandharva, and \xc3\x82sura forms follow next. The Rakshasa\nform is no worse than the one preceding it, and the Pai _s_ a _k_ a is\ndeclared to be the eighth.\n\n40. 40 In the Brahma form, a maiden decked with ornaments is given (to the bridegroom), after he has been invited and honourably received (by the father). When he has been addressed with the words, 'Fulfil your sacred duties together (with her),' it is termed the Pra _g_ apatya form.\n\n41\\. When (the father) receives (from the bridegroom) a dress and a bull and a\ncow, it is termed the \xc3\x82rsha form. When she is given, before the\n\np. 174\n\naltar, to a priest, who officiates at a sacrifice, it is termed the Daiva\nform.\n\n42\\. The union of a willing maiden with her lover is the fifth form, termed\nGandharva. When a price is (asked for the bride by the father and) taken (by\nhim), it is the form termed \xc3\x82sura.\n\n43. 43 The Rakshasa form is declared to consist of the forcible abduction of a maiden. Sexual intercourse with a woman during her sleep or while she is unconscious (of the approach of a man) constitutes the eighth form, the basest of all.\n\n44. 44 Of these, the (first) four, beginning with the Brahma form, are declared to be lawful; the Gandharva form is common (to all castes); the three forms, which come after it, are unlawful.\n\n45. 45 (Besides the lawful wives) seven other sorts of wives are mentioned in order, who have previously been enjoyed by another man. Among these, the Punarbhu (woman twice married) is of three kinds, and the Svairi _n_ i (wanton woman) is fourfold.\n\n* 46. 46 A maiden not deflowered, but disgraced by the act of joining the bride and bridegroom's hands, is\n\np. 175\n\ndeclared to be the first Punarbhu. She is required to have the marriage\nceremony performed once more (when she is married for the second time).\n\n* 47. 47 One who, after having left the husband of her youth and betaken herself to another man, returns into the house of her husband, is declared the second (Punarbhu).\n\n* 48. 48 When a woman, on failure of brothers-in-law, is delivered by her relations to a Sapi _n_ _d_ a of the same caste, she is termed the third (Punarbhu).\n\n* 49. 49 When a woman, no matter whether she have children or not, goes to live with another man through love, her husband being alive, she is the first Svairi _n_ i (wanton woman).\n\n* 50. 50 When a woman, after the death of her husband, rejects her brothers-in-law or other (relations) who have come to her, and unites herself with a stranger through love, she is called the second (Svairi _n_ i).\n\n* 51. 51 One who, having come from a (foreign) country, or having been purchased with money, or being oppressed with hunger or thirst, gives herself up to a man, saying, 'I am thine,'\xc2\x97is declared to be the third (Svairi _n_ i).\n\n* 52. 52 When a woman, after having been given in\n\np. 176\n\nmarriage by her spiritual guides, in a manner corresponding with the usages of\nher country, (is afterwards married) to another by force, she is called the\nlast Svairi _n_ i.\n\n* 53. 53 Thus has the law been declared with regard to Punarbhu and Svairi _n_ i wives. Among them, each preceding one is inferior to the next in order, and each following one is superior to the one preceding her.\n\n* 54. 54 The issue of those women who have been purchased for a price belongs to the begetter. But when nothing has been paid for a woman, her offspring belongs to her legitimate husband.\n\n55\\. When seed is strewn on a field, without the knowledge of the owner, the\ngiver of the seed has no share in it; the fruit belongs absolutely to the\nowner of the field.\n\n56. 56 When seed, carried off by a torrent of water or by a gust of wind, grows up in the field of a\n\np. 177\n\nstranger, the owner of that field shall obtain the produce; none of the\nproduce shall belong to the owner of the seed.\n\n57. 57 When a full-grown bull begets calves with the cows of another man, while roaming in his cow-pen, the calves shall belong to him who owns the cows; in vain has the bull spent his strength.\n\n58. 58 When seed is sown in the field of another with the consent of the owner of that field, the offspring is considered to be the common property of the giver of the seed and the owner of the soil.\n\n* 59. Grain cannot be produced without a field, nor can it be produced without seed. Therefore offspring belongs by right to both, the father as well as the mother.\n\n* 60. 60 Nor is (legitimate) offspring produced, when a man meets a woman at another house than her own. That is declared adultery by those conversant with (the law on) this subject, unless she have come into (the man's) house of her own accord.\n\n* 61. 61 A man is not punishable as an adulterer for having intercourse with the wife of one who has left his. wife without her fault, or of one impotent or consumptive, if the woman herself consents to it.\n\np. 178\n\n* 62. 62 To meet with another man's wife in an unseasonable hour or place, and to sit, converse, or dally with her, these are the three grades of adultery.\n\n* 63. 63 When a woman and a man have meetings at the confluence of two rivers, at a Ghat, in a garden, or in a park, it is also termed adultery.\n\n64\\. By the employment of go-betweens, dispatch of letters and other criminal\nproceedings of various kinds, adultery may be found out by the knowing.\n\n* 65. 65 If one touches a woman in a place (where it is) improper (to touch her) or allows himself to be touched (in such a spot), all such acts, done with mutual consent, are declared to be adultery.\n\n* 66. 66 Bestowing attentions (on a woman), sporting (with her), touching her ornaments and clothes, sitting with her on a bed, all such acts are (also) declared to be adulterous.\n\n* 67. 67 If a man seizes a woman by the hand, by a braid of hair, or by the border of her gown, or if he calls out, 'Stop, stop,' all such acts are (also) declared to be adulterous.\n\n68\\. By the sending of clothes, ornaments, garlands of flowers, drinks, food,\nand fragrant substances, adultery may (also) be discovered by the wise.\n\np. 179\n\n* 69. When a man, actuated by vanity, folly, or braggartism, declares himself, that he has enjoyed the love of a certain woman, that is also termed an adulterous proceeding.\n\n70. 70 When a man has connexion with a woman of his own caste, a fine of the highest degree (shall be inflicted on him); and the middling fine, when he has connexion with a woman of lower caste; and capital punishment, when he has connexion with a woman of superior caste.\n\n71. 71 (When he has connexion) with a maiden against her will, he shall have two fingers cut off. If the maiden belongs to the highest (or Brahman) caste, death and the confiscation of his entire property (shall be his punishment).\n\n* 72. 72 When, however, he has connexion with a willing maiden, it is no offence, but he shall bestow ornaments on her, honour her (with other presents), and (lawfully) espouse her.\n\n* 73. 73 A mother, mother's sister, mother-in-law, maternal uncle's wife, father's sister, paternal uncle's (wife), friend's (wife), pupil's wife, sister, sister's friend, daughter-in-law,\n\n* 74. Daughter, spiritual teacher's wife, Sagotra relation, one come to him for protection, a queen, a female ascetic, a nurse, an honest woman, and a female of the highest caste:\n\np. 180\n\n* 75. 75 When a man carnally knows any one out of these (twenty) women, he is said to commit incest. For that crime, no other punishment than excision of the organ is considered (as a sufficient atonement).\n\n* 76. 76 When a man has sexual connexion with (small) cattle, he shall pay one hundred (Pa _n_ as) as a fine; (for sexual connexion) with a cow, he shall pay the middling fine; and the same (for sexual connexion) with a low-caste woman.\n\n* 77. Let a punishment be inflicted by the king on him who has intercourse with a woman, with whom it is forbidden to have intercourse, and let such sinners be cleared (of the moral offence committed by them) by performing a penance.\n\n* 78. 78 Intercourse is permitted with a wanton woman, who belongs to another than the Brahman caste, or a prostitute, or a female slave, or a female not restrained by her master (nishkasini), if these women belong to a lower caste than oneself; but with a woman of superior caste, intercourse is prohibited.\n\np. 181\n\n* 79. 79 When, however, such a woman is the kept mistress (of another man, intercourse with her) is as criminal as (intercourse) with another man's wife. Such women, though intercourse with them is not (in general) forbidden, must not be approached, because they belong to another man.\n\n* 80. 80 Should the husband of a childless woman die, she must go to her brother-in-law, through desire to obtain a son, after having received the (required) authorization from her Gurus.\n\n81\\. And he shall have intercourse with her, till a son be born. When a son is\nborn, he must leave her. It would be sinful intercourse otherwise.\n\n82-84. (He shall approach) a woman who has brought forth male issue, and who\nis praiseworthy, free from passion, and without amorous desire. He must have\nanointed his limbs with clarified butter, or with oil which has not lost its\nnatural condition, and must turn away his face from hers, and avoid the\ncontact of limb with limb. For this (custom is\n\np. 182\n\npractised) when the family threatens to become extinct, for the continuation\nof the lineage, and not from amorous desire. He must not approach a woman who\nis with child, or blamable, or unauthorized by her relations. Should a woman\nprocreate a son with her brother-in-law without having been authorized thereto\nby her relations,\n\n85\\. He is declared an illegitimate, and incapable of inheriting, by the\nexpounders of the Veda. So when a younger brother has intercourse, without\nauthorization, with the wife of his elder brother,\n\n86. 86 Or an elder brother with the wife of his younger brother, they are both declared to commit incest. After having been authorized by the Gurus, he shall approach the woman and advise her,\n\n* 87. 87 In the manner previously stated, (as if she were) his daughter-in-law. He becomes pure, when the ceremony for the birth of a male child is performed. (Let him approach her) once, or till she has conceived. When she is pregnant, she is even as (his daughter-in-law).\n\np. 183\n\n* 88. Should the man or woman behave otherwise, impelled by amorous desire, they shall be punished severely by the king. Otherwise justice would be violated.\n\n* 89. 89 Husband and wife must not lodge a plaint against one another with their relations, or the king, when a quarrel has arisen through passion, which has its root in jealousy or scorn.\n\n90\\. When husband and wife leave one another, from mutual dislike, it is a\nsin, except when a woman, who is kept under supervision, commits adultery.\n\n* 91. 91 When a married woman commits adultery, her hair shall be shaved, she shall have to lie on a low couch, receive bad food and bad clothing, and the removal of the sweepings shall be assigned to her as her occupation.\n\n* 92. 92 One who wastes the entire property of her husband under the pretence that it is (her own) Stridhana, or who procures abortion, or who makes an\n\np. 184\n\nattempt on her husband's life, he shall banish from the town.\n\n* 93. 93 One who always shows malice to him, or who makes unkind speeches, or eats before her husband, he shall quickly expel from his house.\n\n* 94. Let not a husband show love to a barren woman, or to one who gives birth to female children only, or whose conduct is blamable, or who constantly contradicts him; if he does (have conjugal intercourse with her), he becomes liable to censure (himself).\n\n* 95. If a man leaves a wife who is obedient, pleasant-spoken, skilful, virtuous, and the mother of (male) issue, the king shall make him mindful of his duty by (inflicting) severe punishment (on him).\n\n96. 96 When a faultless maiden has been married to a man who has a blemish unknown (before his marriage), and does not repair to another man (after discovering it), she shall be enjoined to do so by leer relations. If she has no relations living, she shall go (to live with another man) of her own accord.\n\n97. 97 When her husband is lost or dead, when he\n\np. 185\n\nhas become a religious ascetic, when he is impotent, and when he has been\nexpelled from caste: these are the five cases of legal necessity, in which a\nwoman may be justified in taking another husband.\n\n98. 98 Eight years shall a Brahman woman wait for the return of her absent husband; or four years, if she has no issue; after that time, she may betake herself to another man.\n\n99\\. A Kshatriya woman shall wait six years; or three years, if she has no\nissue; a Vai _s_ ya woman shall wait four (years), if she has issue; any other\nVai _s_ ya woman (i.e. one who has no issue), two years.\n\n100. 100 No such (definite) period is prescribed for a _S_ udra woman, whose husband is gone on a journey. Twice the above period is ordained, when the (absent) husband is alive and tidings are received of him.\n\n101\\. The above series of rules has been laid down by the Creator of the world\nfor those cases where a man has disappeared. No offence is imputed to a woman\nif she goes to live with another man after (the fixed period has elapsed).\n\np. 186\n\n102. 102 This body of laws is applicable to the offspring of unions in the direct order of the castes; the offspring of a marriage union in the inverse order of the castes is said to be (produced by) a confusion of castes.\n\n103. 103 There are Anantara, Ekantara, and Dvyantara sons both in the direct and inverse order of the castes.\n\n104\\. (Of this description are) the Ugra, Para _s_ ava, and Nishada, (who are\nbegotten) in the direct order, as well as the Ambash _th_ a, Magadha, and\nKshatt _ri_ , who spring from a Kshatriya woman.\n\n105\\. One of these (latter castes) is begotten in the direct order, of the two\n(others) it must be known that they are (begotten) in an inverse order. The\nKshatt _ri_ and the rest are begotten in an\n\np. 187\n\ninverse order, the (three) mentioned first in the direct order.\n\n106. 106 Sacraments, beginning with the boiling of gruel, three times seven in number (shall be performed) by them. The son (of a Brahman) with a Brahman woman is equal in caste (to his father). The son (of a Brahman) with a Kshatriya woman is an Anantara.\n\n107\\. An Ambash _th_ a and an Ugra are begotten in the same way by Kshatriya\nmen and on Vai _s_ ya women respectively. An Ambash _th_ a is an Ekantara, the\nson of a Brahman with a Vai _s_ ya woman.\n\n108\\. In the same way, a son called Nishada\n\np. 188\n\nsprings from the union of a Kshatriya with a _S_ udra woman. A _S_ udra woman\nobtains from a Brahman a son (called) Para _s_ ava, who is superior (to the\nNishada).\n\n109\\. Thus have the sons born in the direct order of castes been declared. The\ntwo sons called Suta and Magadha as well as the \xc3\x82yogava,\n\n110\\. And the Kshatt _ri_ and Vaidehaka are begotten in the inverse order of\ncastes. The Suta is declared to he an Anantara, begotten by a Kshatriya on a\nBrahman woman.\n\n111\\. Similarly, the Magadha and \xc3\x82yogava are the sons of Vai _s_ ya and _S_\nudra fathers (and of a Brahman mother) A Brahman woman obtains of a Vai _s_ ya\nfather an Ekantara son, the Vaidehaka.\n\n112\\. A Kshatriya woman (obtains of a _S_ udra) an Ekantara son, called Kshatt\n_ri_. A Dvyantara son in the inverse order, the most abject of men, because he\nis the fruit of sinful intercourse,\n\n113. 113 _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala by name, is born of a _S_ udra, when a Brahman woman forgets herself (with him). Therefore must the king take special care to prevent women from sinful intercourse with men of different caste.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[164:1](sbe3344.htm#fr_488) XII, 1. Manu IX, 1.\n\n[165:2](sbe3344.htm#fr_489) The Sm _ri_ ti-writers, as a rule, do not mention\nthe act of vara _n_ a, 'choice of a bride,' at all. It appears from the next\nparagraph that Narada also does not place it on a par with the ceremony of\nmarriage, which is indissoluble for life.\n\n[165:3](sbe3344.htm#fr_490) The 'choice of the bride,' or betrothal, being\ndissoluble on the discovery of a blemish (in either party), it follows that\nthe act of joining the bride and bridegroom's hands, i.e. the ceremony of\nmarriage, must be indissoluble. See, too, paragraph 28. The particular Mantras\nto be recited during the marriage ceremony are given in the G _ri_ hya-sutras.\n\n[165:4](sbe3344.htm#fr_491) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 13, 5; Vasish _th_ a VIII, 1;\nGautama IV, 1; Manu III, 12; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 55.\n\n[165:5](sbe3344.htm#fr_492) 5, 6.

A Vai _s_ ya may marry a _S_ udra\nwoman, besides a wife of his own caste. A Vai _s_ ya woman may either take a\nVai _s_ ya husband, or she may wed a Kshatriya or a Brahman. A Kshatriya may\neither take a Kshatriya husband, or she may marry a Brahman.\n\n[166:7](sbe3344.htm#fr_494) A Sagotra is a relative bearing the same family\nname (laukika gotra).

It should be observed,\nhowever, that the eligibility of impotent men or eunuchs for marriage is\nrecognised in the Code of Manu (IX, 203), and that such men are very commonly\nmarried now-a-days.\n\n[166:9](sbe3344.htm#fr_496) The curious disquisition on impotency is quoted in\nsuch an p. 167 early compilation as Apararka's Commentary of the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya-sm _ri_ ti (twelfth century), which goes far to prove its genuineness.\nApararka's gloss on this passage, scanty as it is, has proved useful in\nelucidating some of the difficult terms occurring in it, and in establishing\nthe correct readings. Besides, I have been able to avail myself of some\nvaluable remarks, kindly communicated to me by the late Dr. Haas, the well-\nknown connoisseur of Indian medicine.\n\n[167:10](sbe3344.htm#fr_497) An analogous text is quoted from the Sm _ri_ ti\nof Katyayana. 'He is called impotent whose urine froths not and whose faeces\nsink in water, and whose generative organ is deficient in erection or seminal\njuices.' See Colebrooke's Digest, V, 5, 330.\n\n[167:12](sbe3344.htm#fr_498) 'One naturally impotent' (nisargasha _n_ _dh_ a),\none born without the capacity of producing semen. Apararka. This category\nseems to be synonymous with the saha _g_ a of Su _s_ ruta, the standard writer\non medicine. Pakshasha _n_ _dh_ a, according to Apararka, is one capable of\napproaching a woman once in every half-month (Paksha).\n\n[167:13](sbe3344.htm#fr_499) The jealous man, irshyasha _n_ _dh_ a, seems to\nbe identical with the irshyaka of Su _s_ ruta, 'qui nisi alius cujusdam\nineuntis feminam p. 168 conspectu non potest.' The term sevya is obscure\nenough. Dr. Haas proposes to read _k_ a _s_ evya _s_ _k_ a or _k_ a mevya _s_\n_k_ a or _k_ asekya _s_ _k_ a, for _k_ a sevya _s_ _k_ a. The asekya is a\nspecies of impotent person according to Su _s_ ruta. It may be, however, that\nthe reading sevya is correct, and denotes one with whom sexual intercourse is\npossible. Mukhebhaga, 'is qui ore prout cunno utitur.' The revolting practice\nin question is repeatedly referred to e.g. by Narada himself, VI, 19,\naccording to the commentators, and I, 183. Dr. Haas proposes to read\nmushkabhagna _h_ , 'one deprived of the scrotum.' It may be argued, however,\nthat this category has already been referred to in paragraph 12, and that the\nreading mushkabhagna is objectionable for metrical reasons. According to\nApararka, akshipta, the next term, means 'is cujus semen in coitu retro (aut\nsusum) fluit;' moghabi _g_ a means 'is cui semen ad propagationem aptum non\nest;' _s_ alina means 'is cujus penis coitu facto collabitur;' and anyapati,\nthe last term, means 'is qui cum alia femina praeter uxorem potest.'\n\n[168:15](sbe3344.htm#fr_500) 'Like an outcast (patita).' Dr. Haas assigns a\ndifferent meaning to the term patita, viz. 'is cujus penis collabitur;' and\nrefers to such expressions as dhva _g_ a _h_ patati, 'penis collabitur,' in\nthe Bhavapraka _s_ a.\n\n[169:20](sbe3344.htm#fr_501) 20, 21. The object of these rules is to prevent\nthat any marriageable maiden should remain unmarried, which is a great point\nin the eyes of a Hindu legislator. Vish _n_ u XXIV, 38, 39; Manu V, 151; Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 63. The Nepalese MS. refers to the maternal instead of the\npaternal grandfather.\n\n[169:22](sbe3344.htm#fr_502) 22, 23. This is the custom of Svaya _m_ vara,\n'self-choice (of a bridegroom),' so well known from the Indian epics. It\nappears from this paragraph that Narada does not allow this custom to be\npractised except with certain restrictions. See, however, the next paragraph.\n'Age;' Manu says (IX, 94) that a man at the age of thirty shall marry a maiden\nof twelve, and a man aged twenty-four, years a maiden of eight. Gautama XVIII,\n20; Vasish _th_ a XVII, p. 170 67, 68; Manu IX, 90-92; Vish _n_ u XXIV, 40; Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 64; Baudhayana IV, 1, 14. Read anurupa _m_ in the text.\n\n[170:24](sbe3344.htm#fr_503) This is the law in the case of a woman recently\nmarried, when consummation has not yet taken place. As for the conduct\nenjoined to one left by her husband, when they have been married for some\nlength of time, see paragraphs 96-101.\n\n[170:25](sbe3344.htm#fr_504) Maturity, according to a well-known versus\nmemorialis, generally commences after completion of the tenth year. 'One aged\neight years is a child; one aged nine years is a maiden; one aged ten years is\na virgin; after that time she is a marriageable woman.' See Para _s_ ara VII,\n6; Sa _m_ varta V, 66; Gautama XVIII, 22; Vasish _th_ a XVII, 69; Vish _n_ u\nXXIV, 41; Manu IX, 4, 93.\n\n[170:26](sbe3344.htm#fr_505) Vasish _th_ a XVII, 71; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 64;\nBaudhayana IV, 1, 13.\n\n[170:27](sbe3344.htm#fr_506) It must not be inferred from this rule that\nNarada is not p. 171 an advocate of infant marriage, like many other Sm _ri_\nti-writers. Thus Daksha says, 'Let a maiden be given in marriage at the age of\neight years; thus justice will not be violated.' A\xe1\xb9\x85giras rules that a maiden\nmust be given in marriage in her tenth year by all means. Ra _g_ amarta _n_\n_d_ a, Yama, and Para _s_ ara declare that it is a heavy sin if she continues\nto reside at her father's house after having reached her twelfth year of age.\nVasish _th_ a, Gautama, Vish _n_ u, and Manu (IX, 93) ordain to give a maiden\nin marriage before she attains the age of puberty.\n\n[171:28](sbe3344.htm#fr_507) This is the general rule regarding the\nindissolubility of the marriage tie. Divers important restrictions of this\nrule are stated in paragraphs 24, 29, 30, 96-101. Identical with Manu IX, 47.\nThe Nepalese MS. inserts two paragraphs here: 'Soma springs into existence\nwhen the marks of puberty appear, and enjoys women. Their breast is a\nGandharva, and Agni (the god of fire) is said to dwell in their menstrual\ndischarge. Therefore let a father give his daughter in marriage before the\nmarks of puberty have appeared in her, and before the menses and the breasts\nhave been developed, and before she has been enjoyed by Soma and the rest.'\nThe first paragraph occurs in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ atantra as well. See the\nPetersburg Dictionary, s. v. Gandharva.\n\n[171:29](sbe3344.htm#fr_508) Other legal consequences of the choice of a\nparticular form of marriage are stated in the law of inheritance. See XIII, 9.\n\n[171:30](sbe3344.htm#fr_509) Out of the various meanings of the term _s_ ulka,\nthe meaning p. 172 'nuptial gift, presented to the parents of the bride by the\nbridegroom,' is no doubt the only one which fits in this place, as it appears\nfrom the preceding paragraph that this rule is applicable principally to the\n\xc3\x82sura form of marriage, i.e. marriage by purchase. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 65.\n\n[172:31](sbe3344.htm#fr_510) Manu VIII, 225; IX, 72; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 66;\nVish _n_ u V, 47.\n\n[172:32](sbe3344.htm#fr_511) Manu IX, 71; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 65.\n\n[172:33](sbe3344.htm#fr_512) Manu VIII, 224; IX, 73; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 66;\nVish _n_ u V, 45.\n\n[172:34](sbe3344.htm#fr_513) Vish _n_ u V, 47; Manu VIII, 225; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya I, 66.\n\n[172:35](sbe3344.htm#fr_514) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 66.\n\n[172:36](sbe3344.htm#fr_515) It does not become quite clear how far the last\nterm in this p. 173 enumeration, anyagatabhava, differs in import from the two\nterms immediately preceding it. Perhaps it denotes one pregnant, or who has\nhad a child with another man.\n\n[173:37](sbe3344.htm#fr_516) 'To have forsaken his relatives.' It is evident\nthat certain near relatives must be meant, as e.g. Manu says (VIII, 389) that\na mother, father, wife, or son must not be forsaken.\n\n[173:38](sbe3344.htm#fr_517) 38-43. Manu III, 20, 21, 27-34; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya I, 58-61; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 11, 17-II, 5, 12, 2; Gautama IV, 6-13\nBaudhayana I, 20, 1-9; Vasish _th_ a I, 28-35; Vish _n_ u XXIV, 17-26.\n\n[173:40](sbe3344.htm#fr_518) See Professor Buhler's note on Manu III, 30, 27.\n\n[174:43](sbe3344.htm#fr_519) The term pramatta, translated by 'unconscious,'\nmay either refer to a temporary or to a permanent derangement of the maiden's\nintellect.\n\n[174:44](sbe3344.htm#fr_520) Manu III, 23-26; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 12, 3; Gautama\nIV, 14, 15; Baudhayana I, 20, 10-16; Vish _n_ u XXIV, 27, 28.\n\n[174:45](sbe3344.htm#fr_521) The fact that Narada treats Punarbhus, 'remarried\nwomen,' as being only one degree superior to Svairi _n_ is, 'wanton women,'\nand belonging like the latter to the category of women previously enjoyed by\nanother man, indicates the low estimation in which he holds remarried women,\nthough remarriage is a perfectly legitimate proceeding, according to him, in\ncertain cases. Manu V, 163; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 67. Read trividha in the\ntext.\n\n[174:46](sbe3344.htm#fr_522) 'The act of joining the bride and bridegroom's\nhands,' the marriage ceremony. Vasish _th_ a XVII, 20; Manu IX, 176; Vish _n_\nu XV, 8.\n\n[175:47](sbe3344.htm#fr_523) Manu IX, 176; Vasish _th_ a XVII, 19; Vish _n_ u\nXV, 9.\n\n[175:48](sbe3344.htm#fr_524) This is an allusion to the custom of Niyoga or\nlevirate, as described below, in paragraphs 80-88.\n\n[175:49](sbe3344.htm#fr_525) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 67.\n\n[175:50](sbe3344.htm#fr_526) The 'wanton woman' here referred to is apparently\none who, after the death of her husband, declines to perform the custom of\nNiyoga with a brother-in-law or other relation, and goes to live with a\nstranger instead of it.\n\n[175:51](sbe3344.htm#fr_527) 'I am thine;' this is the formula by which a\nslave that is to be delivers himself to his future master. See above, V, 27.\n\n[175:52](sbe3344.htm#fr_528) The term utpannasahasa has been translated 'by\nforce.' p. 176 The Mitakshara, p. 77, interprets it by utpannavyabhi _k_ ara,\n'through adultery,' which seems to mean that an elopement is referred to, and\nnot a forcible abduction. In that case, however, this species of wanton women\nwould coincide entirely with the species described in paragraph 49. Besides,\nit appears from what is said in paragraph 53, that the species of wanton women\ndescribed in paragraph 52 must be less reprehensible than the three species\ndescribed in the preceding paragraphs.\n\n[176:53](sbe3344.htm#fr_529) The Nepalese MS. has the following two paragraphs\ninstead of 53. 'Among the four sorts of Svairi _n_ i women, the last\nrespectively are preferable to those previously mentioned; the treatment of\ntheir offspring is optional, as regards inheritance, funeral oblations of\nballs of meal and water, and other concerns. To Punarbhu women, the same rule\nis applicable as to Svairi _n_ i women. Among them (also) each preceding one\nis inferior,' &c.\n\n[176:54](sbe3344.htm#fr_530) This rule shows that the purchase and sale of\nwomen must have been a very common proceeding in the times of Narada.\n\n[176:56](sbe3344.htm#fr_531) Manu IX, 54.\n\n[177:57](sbe3344.htm#fr_532) Manu IX, 50, &c.\n\n[177:58](sbe3344.htm#fr_533) Manu IX, 53.\n\n[177:60](sbe3344.htm#fr_534) When a woman enters the house of her paramour of\nher own accord to have intercourse with him, there is no offence (on his\npart). Vivada _k_ intama _n_ i, p. 112. The Nepalese MS. reads this paragraph\ndifferently: 'When a man has intercourse with a woman who has a protector\nliving, at another man's house, it is termed adultery by those conversant with\nthe subject, unless,' &c.\n\n[177:61](sbe3344.htm#fr_535) When a man has connexion with a married woman,\nforsaken by her husband, or whose husband is impotent or feeble, he is not\npunishable, in case the woman consents to it, even though he meet her at her\nown house. Vivada _k_ intama _n_ i, p. 112.\n\n[178:62](sbe3344.htm#fr_536) Manu VIII, 354; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 284.\n\n[178:63](sbe3344.htm#fr_537) Manu VIII, 356. The Nepalese MS. omits paragraphs\n64, 65, and arranges paragraphs 66-69 differently.\n\n[178:65](sbe3344.htm#fr_538) Identical with Manu VIII, 358. 'A place (where it\nis) improper (to touch her).' For a different interpretation of this term, see\nProfessor Buhler's note on Manu VIII, 358.\n\n[178:66](sbe3344.htm#fr_539) 'Bestowing attentions on a woman,' doing what is\nagreeable to her. Vivada _k_ intama _n_ i, p. 110. Nearly identical with Manu\nVIII, 357.\n\n[178:67](sbe3344.htm#fr_540) Such acts, when committed against another woman\nthan one's own wife, constitute the offence of adultery. That is the meaning.\nVivada _k_ intama _n_ i, p. 110; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 284.\n\n[179:70](sbe3344.htm#fr_541) Manu VIII, 374-385; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 286;\nVish _n_ u V, 40, 41; Gautama XII, 2, 3; Baudhayana II, 3, 52, &c.\n\n[179:71](sbe3344.htm#fr_542) Manu VIII, 366, 367; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 288.\n\n[179:72](sbe3344.htm#fr_543) Manu VIII, 366; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 288. The\nNepalese MS. reads: * 'When a man of the same caste has intercourse with a\nwilling maiden.'\n\n[179:73](sbe3344.htm#fr_544) 73-75. Manu XI, 171; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III,\n231-233, &c.\n\n[180:75](sbe3344.htm#fr_545) The fact that female ascetics (pravra _g_ ita)\nare reckoned by Narada among those females whose violation is incest\xc2\x97literally\n'an offence as heavy as the violation of a spiritual teacher's\nbed'\xc2\x97constitutes an important difference between his teaching and Manu's. Manu\nordains the same punishment for the violation of female ascetics as for the\nviolation of the wives of actors and singers and other abandoned women. See\nProfessor Buhler's note on Manu VIII, 363. All commentators declare that this\nrule is applicable in the case of guarded women only. The Vivada _k_ intama\n_n_ i says that the term 'mother' denotes a stepmother in paragraph 73.\n\n[180:76](sbe3344.htm#fr_546) Vish _n_ u V, 43, 44; Manu VIII, 385; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya II, 289.\n\n[180:78](sbe3344.htm#fr_547) The two terms, svairi _n_ i, 'a wanton woman,'\nand abrahma _n_ i, 'one not belonging to the Brahman caste,' have to be\nconnected. 'A wanton woman,' a self-willed unchaste woman. Nishkasini p. 181\nmeans 'one who has left her family' according to the Madanaratna, and 'a\nfemale slave not restrained by her master' according to Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ane _s_\nvara, Madhava _k_ arya, and the rest. Viramitrodaya, p. 510. See above, V, 39.\n\n[181:79](sbe3344.htm#fr_548) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 290. The Nepalese MS.\nreads 'when they belong to another man.'\n\n[181:80](sbe3344.htm#fr_549) 80-88. Manu IX, 59-64, 143; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I,\n69; Gautama XVIII, 4-8; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 27, 2, 3; Vasish _th_ a XVII, 55,\n66; Baudhayana II, 4, 9-10. Regarding the history of the Indian levirate, see\nmy 'Outlines of a History of Hindu Law' (Tagore Law Lectures for 1883), pp.\n153, 154.\n\n80\\. The Gurus intended are, the teacher, sub-teacher, and officiating priests\nof the deceased husband. See Professor Buhler's note on Vasish _th_ a XVII,\n56. According to Vasish _th_ a, the authority of both the Gurus and relatives\nis required. The relatives are referred to by Narada himself, paragraphs\n82-84.\n\n[182:86](sbe3344.htm#fr_550) According to _G_ agannatha's reading of these\ntexts, the appointment to raise offspring may be given by the king also, where\nGurus and relations are wanting. The same clause is found in the Nepalese MS.\n'He shall advise the woman' means, according to _G_ agannatha, 'he shall teach\nher the general illegality of receiving the caresses of other men, and the\nparticular legality of an appointment to raise up offspring.' See Colebrooke's\n( _G_ agannatha's) Digest, IV, 4, 147.\n\n[182:87](sbe3344.htm#fr_551) 'His daughter-in-law;' a brother's wife is\nconsidered as similar to a daughter-in-law, according to _G_ agannatha. See\nloc. cit. The 'ceremony for the birth of a male child' (Pu _m_ savana), which\nhas the procreation of a son for its object, is usually performed at the time\nwhen the mother perceives the first signs of a living conception. It has to be\nobserved that the reading of this paragraph is uncertain, and its rendering\nconjectural. The Nepalese MS. agrees with _G_ agannatha.\n\n[183:89](sbe3344.htm#fr_552) The term sa _m_ bandha, literally 'connexion,'\nhas been rendered by 'a quarrel.' It can hardly be referred to friendly\nconnexion (with another man or woman) in this place. The prohibition of\nlawsuits between wife and husband may be compared to the analogous\nprohibition, in the case of husband and wife, of suretyship, division of\nproperty, contracting of debts, and giving evidence.\n\n[183:91](sbe3344.htm#fr_553) Mitrami _s_ ra, in the Viramitrodaya, p. 520,\nquotes this text as proving that an adulteress even has a claim to\nmaintenance. He interprets it as follows. When a woman has committed adultery\nthrough amorous desire, she shall be shaved and compelled to lie on a low\ncouch, bad food and a bad dwelling shall be given to her for her maintenance;\nand the removal of rubbish shall be assigned to her as her occupation. Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 70.\n\n[183:92](sbe3344.htm#fr_554) As for the constituents of Stridhana, or separate\nproperty of a woman, see XIII, 8.\n\n[184:93](sbe3344.htm#fr_555) 'He shall expel from his house.' This, according\nto an interpretation mentioned by _G_ agannatha, means that he shall banish\nher from the principal habitation, assigning to her a separate dwelling within\nhis close. See Colebrooke's Digest, IV, 1, 63. This interpretation is hardly\ncorrect, though it is interesting as it shows the tendency of the commentators\nto explain away those laws under which married women were deprived of their\nclaim to maintenance. Manu IX, 80, 81; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 73, &c.\n\n[184:96](sbe3344.htm#fr_556) This rule shows that a marriage is dissoluble on\nthe discovery of a blemish, as well as a betrothal. See XII, 3.\n\n[184:97](sbe3344.htm#fr_557) 'Lost,' i.e. gone no one knows whither. This\ntext, or an identical text of Para _s_ ara, has been frequently appealed to by\nthe p. 185 modern advocates of the remarriage of widows in India. Vasish _th_\na XVII, 74.\n\n[185:98](sbe3344.htm#fr_558) 98, 99. Vasish _th_ a XVII, 75-80; Manu IX, 76,\n77; Gautama XVIII, 15-17.\n\n[185:100](sbe3344.htm#fr_559) 100, 101. The Nepalese MS. has three paragraphs\ninstead of these two, as follows:\xc2\x97'100. No such period is ordained for a _S_\nudra woman, nor is justice violated (in her case). The utmost limit for her is\na year, especially if she has no issue. 101. This term has been ordained for\nthe wives of absent husbands who are dead. Twice the same term is ordained,\nwhen (the absent husband) is alive and tidings are received of him. 101 a. The\n(other) term has been ordained for those who have issue (?). Afterwards, no\noffence is imputed to a woman who goes to live with another man.'\n\n[186:102](sbe3344.htm#fr_560) 'In the direct order of the castes,' i.e. where\na man of higher marries a woman of lower caste. 'In the inverse order of the\ncastes,' i.e. where a woman of higher marries a man of lower caste.\n\n[186:103](sbe3344.htm#fr_561) 103-113. Manu X, 6-41; Gautama IV, 16-28; Vasish\n_th_ a XVIII; Baudhayana I, 16, 6-12, 17 passim; Vish _n_ u XVI, 1-7; Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 91-95.\n\n103\\. An Anantara is the son of a father whose caste is only one degree higher\nor lower than the caste of the mother. An Ekantara is the son of a father\nwhose caste is two degrees higher or lower than the caste of the mother. A\nDvyantara is the son of a father whose caste is three degrees higher or lower\nthan the caste of the mother. The Nepalese MS., throughout superior to the\nIndian MSS., reads as follows:\xc2\x97'103. An Ugra, Para _s_ ava, and Nishada are\n(begotten) in the direct order, and are declared to be the sons of _S_ udra\nwomen with husbands of the (three) higher castes. 104. Of a Brahman woman are\nborn a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala, a Suta, and a Vaidehaka; they are declared to spring\nin an inverse order, from their union with husbands of different caste. 105.\nAn Ambash _th_ a, Magadha, and Kshatt _ri_ are the sons of a Kshatriya woman.\nOf these, one is born in the direct, and two are born in the inverse order.\n106 a. Of a Vai _s_ ya woman, are born an Ambash _th_ a, Yavana, and \xc3\x82yogava.\np. 187 Of these, one is born in the inverse, and two are born in the direct\norder. 106 b. A Suta and the other Pratilomas (men born in the inverse order),\nwho are begotten contrary to order, are declared to partake of the series of\nthree times seven sacraments, beginning with the Paka ceremony (cooking food).\n106 c. The son,' &c.\n\n[187:106](sbe3344.htm#fr_562) The meaning of the first half of this paragraph\nis somewhat obscure. The term tri _h_ sapta, 'three times seven,' has been\nconnected with sa _m_ skara _s_ , 'sacraments.' The sacraments are peculiar to\nthose mixed castes, which are procreated in the direct order of castes. See\nManu X, 41. The 'boiling of gruel' ( _k_ arupaka) being mentioned as the first\nsacrament, it appears that the sacraments here referred to are identical with\nthe ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, 'sacrifices,' of which there are twenty-one according to\nthe usual theory. See Gautama XVIII, 18\xc2\x9620, and Professor Weber's paper on\nVedic Sacrificial Rites, Indische Studien, X, p. 320. It is also possible to\nconnect the clause 'three times seven' with 'them.' The number of twenty-one\nmixed castes procreated in a direct order is received by adding the fifteen\ncastes springing from a further mixture between the mixed castes (Manu X, 31)\nto the six principal mixed castes procreated in a direct order. For vai mata\n_h_ , as I have conjectured, the MSS. read kosh _th_ ata _h_ , which might be\nrendered '(The twenty-one sacraments, beginning with the boiling of gruel,\nhave to be performed by them) out of a pot.' However, the correctness of this\nreading is liable to considerable doubt. The Nepalese MS. reads, to sa _m_\nskara _s_ _k_ a pakadyas tesha _m_ tri _h_ saptako ga _n_ a _h_. This is\nperhaps the original reading. See the preceding note.\n\n[188:113](sbe3344.htm#fr_563) The Nepalese MS. inserts the following before\nthe clause beginning with the word 'Therefore:'\xc2\x97'Because confusion of the\ncastes springs up, where the king keeps no watch over them.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Thirteenth Title of Law.
