( _Svetasvatara_ _-Upanishad_\n, _VI_., 23). These are the words with which the Upanishad concludes its\nteaching and with which Suresvaracharya, like many other teachers, closes his\nexposition of the Vedanta Doctrine. They form the key-note of the whole Vedic\nReligion as of all other Religious systems based on Revelation. It behoves,\ntherefore, the student of spiritual wisdom,--nay, it behoves every seeker\nafter Truth,--to study and understand the principle enunciated in the passage\nquoted above. To this end we have first to determine what place Revelation\noccupies in a religious system and how it helps man to realise truth. The Leda\nwhich is composed of different parts embodying teachings suited to different\nclasses of people is, even in the form in which we have it, one of the oldest,\nif not the oldest, Scriptures accepted by large masses of people, revealing\ntruths derived from the most\n\np. xx\n\ntrustworthy source, from God Himself. It may, therefore, be taken as the type\nof Revelation intended to help the growth of man towards the attainment of his\nhighest end.\n\n2\\. What is the highest end of man? As to the ultimate end of man, a consensus\nof opinion can be obtained by a direct appeal to consciousness, though there\nmay be found divergencies among writers on ethical philosophy as to the\nimmediate end which man should place before himself in his conduct towards\nhimself or in his conduct towards others. All are agreed that the one aim\nwhich. man has in all his acts is to secure happiness for himself. The highest\nas well as the ultimate end of man must, therefore, be to attain to a\nconscious state of unalloyed happiness, which is to be eternal and\nunsurpassed. To have a clearer and more definite idea of the highest end of\nman, it is necessary to compare him with other creatures in the universe and\nto mark the stage he has already reached in the march of progress towards the\nattainment of his highest end. The ancient Aryans have traced the evolutionary\nprocess in detail, and they fall in with the modern science as to the view\nthat human form has been gradually evolved out of the animal. The evolutionary\nprocess which went on through the three lower kingdoms of nature below man,--\nnot to speak of the still earlier stages of evolution referred to in the\nUpanishads, in the Puranas, and\n\np. xxi\n\nin the orthodox systems of philosophy,--was concerned mainly with the\nperfecting of form, of the material vehicle used by Spirit, the Divine\nConsciousness, in Its evolution towards perfect self-realisation. The main\npurpose of this evolution is to so perfect the form as to make it a proper\nmedium for the Divine Being dwelling within every creature to fully express\nHimself in all His aspects as Consciousness, Will, and Bliss. In the mineral\nkingdom, the physical form, which in the earlier kingdoms was more or less\nunstable, has attained to the highest degree of development in point of\npersistency under varying conditions; and in the vegetable kingdom, it becomes\npliable to the action of vital force in the form of organic growth, without at\nthe same time losing the persistency it has already gained in the mineral\nkingdom. The evolution of form in the animal kingdom adds to its persistency\nand improved capacity for organic growth a well-defined capacity for a life of\nsensation, all organs of sensation and activity being developed to a marked\ndegree. In man, form is still further developed so as to constitute a fitting\ninstrument for the carrying on of the process of thinking. By the time that\nthe evolution of human form has, after passing through a long transition\nperiod, reached that stage at which it no longer admits of any appreciable\nfurther development, what we call mind begins to show signs of its\n\np. xxii\n\nexistence by way of perceiving objects, connecting them together, comparing\nand contrasting them with one another,--processes which constitute the germs\nof the thinking faculty. To explain: Animals, in common with man, possess a\nlife of sensation, their sense-organs equally receiving and responding to\nimpacts from external objects; but they evidently seem to lack the power of\nconnecting the various impressions together into a single composite whole;\n_i.e._ , they seem to have no faculty of perception. They receive impressions\nthrough the sense organs from without; and these impressions affect in their\nturn the prana or vital principle wherein they abide. In response to the\n[impressions](errata.htm#2) received through the sense-organs, prana gushes\nout through one or more organs of activity in the body; and, as a result, the\nsense-organs are brought in contact with more objects. In the animal, the\nsensory and motor forms of vital energy thus act and react upon each other,\neach contributing to the growth of the other. But this reciprocal action and\nreaction of the sensory and the motor organs on the growth of each other as a\nresult of receiving impacts from the external world can in no way correspond\nto the purely internal faculty of perception and conception constituting the\ngerms of that faculty of thinking which forms a distinguishing feature of\nhuman beings "Thus, man is distinguished from lower\n\np. xxiii\n\nanimals by the possession of this [faculty](errata.htm#3) of perception and\nthought. It is in him that we find Atman,--the one Existence and Consciousness\npresent in all kingdoms of nature alike,--manifesting Himself in every act of\nconsciousness as "I," as the Individual Ego, persisting through various\nsensations, each of which comes into being for a moment and then disappears.\nIt is this self-conscious Individual Ego who, abiding one and the same through\nall the various sensations, receives them all and connects them together,\nconverting them into notions of substances and attributes, comparing and\ncontrasting them with one another, taking note of their mutual relations,\ndeducing laws, and carrying on the elaborate process of reasoning. _Pari\npassu_ with this development of thinking faculty goes on the development of\nwill, freedom of will progressing with thought and knowledge. It is,\ntherefore, evident that the ultimate end of every human being should be to\ndevelop thought and will, by proper exercise through his form, to the highest\nstage of perfection; to attain to a full knowledge of the whole universe; to\ndevelop the self-consciousness and will of the Ego till he realises his unity\nwith the Universal Ego, with the Divine Being possessed of all-embracing\nknowledge and love as well as an absolutely free will unswayed by passion, all\nbending before His adamantine will, the whole\n\np. xxiv\n\nuniverse subservient to Him as a pliable instrument in His hands;--seeing\nhimself everywhere and none else anywhere, endued with Bliss infinite and\nunalloyed, transcending all limitations of time and space. Such, briefly, is\nthe end which man has to attain, and which, of course, is worth attaining.\n\n3\\. Now, if we compare man just emerging from a state of nature and in whom\nmanas just begins to function, with a man who belongs to one of the most\ncivilized races now inhabiting the globe, the difference in mental development\nwill be found strikingly great, so great indeed that, but for the similarity\nin the structure of the body, they may belong to two different species\naltogether. The rate of progress in this line of evolution seems to be very\nslow. The various faculties which go to form the main stock of innate\ncapacities of a civilized man have been developed slowly one after another in\nsuccessive races. It takes, indeed, a very very long time for a faculty to\ndevelop from its germinal stage even to that stage of perfection which it has\nreached in man at present. In fact we are told that this mental development\nhas gone on concurrently with the racial development for ages and ages. Though\neach race has a development of its own as a whole, yet any given race is made\nup of individuals whose progress varies very widely between two extreme\npoints. Considering the little progress made by an individual Ego in a\n\np. xxv\n\nsavage or a half-savage tribe by way of acquiring a new faculty or even a\nfurther development, to any appreciable extent, of an already existing\nfaculty,--as distinguished from the matter comprehended by that faculty,--one\nfinds it hard to believe that all the faculties that an Ego, taking birth in a\nfamily of the most civilised race, manifests on attaining to a certain age\nhave been developed in a few past incarnations just preceding the present, and\nmuch less so in the present birth alone. Moreover, the different stages of\nprogress in mental and moral development reached by different individuals, as\nwell as the different rates of progress made by different individuals placed\nunder the same circumstances, point, beyond all reasonable doubt, to the fact\nof each individual Ego having an evolution of his own which has been going on\nthrough many lives in the past, bringing with him into each birth faculties\nalready developed to a certain stage and ready to pace a few more steps\nforward in that incarnation. It may even be noted that, in the early years of\nany particular birth, the individual man rapidly goes through the whole\nprocess of past human evolution till that point of progress is reached whence\nhe has to continue the slow process of further development.\n\n4\\. When the Ego has reached a certain stage of growth, no further advance can\nbe effected\n\np. xxvi\n\nwithout an external guide. Even the progress that has already been made has\nnot been made without the guide of Higher Intelligent Beings, though, indeed,\nthis aid has been rendered independently of the will and choice of the\nindividuals concerned. On attaining to a certain stage of intellectual\ndevelopment, each individual Ego has to consciously choose and act for\nhimself. He should no longer content himself with the limited scope of his\nwill and knowledge if he would ever rise above the present level where he is a\nslave to the surrounding circumstances, entirely guided and acted on by them,\n--a state which is quite contrary to that which he wishes to attain, to the\nstate of unity with the very Divine Being who knows all and guides and shapes\nthe whole universe according to His will, His will being the law according to\nwhich the universe has to evolve. Having this grand aim in view, he should\ndevelop faculties whereby the sphere of his knowledge and experience may be\nextended so that he may know the right from the wrong, the good from the evil,\nand consciously follow the right and the good while consciously avoiding the\nwrong and the evil. In short, he should be able to know what is absolutely\nright; and, rising above all human motives of action, his will should be as\nfree to act in the right way as that of the Divine Being. Now is the time for\nRevelation to teach to man its first lessons. It\n\np. xxvii\n\nis the Guru or His voice as the Sruti (Revelation) that teaches man about the\nexistence of an immortal Ego who is conscious of everything that goes on\naround him. It shows what man should do if he wishes to secure a happy life\nafter death. To this end various rules of moral conduct are laid down and an\nelaborate process of ceremonial prescribed, which being duly observed,. man\nlives a happy life after death in the region of svarga, quite beyond the reach\nof misery which man here on earth is put to. A knowledge of the immortality of\nthe Ego and of the means of securing bliss in a future world cannot be\nacquired by the mere unaided intellect of man. The past conscious experience\nis not enough even to make him suspect the existence of a disembodied Ego;\nmuch less can it convince him of his reality and enable him to discover the\nmeans whereby to secure unearthly happiness in a world altogether beyond his\ncomprehension.\n\n5\\. To realise the Vedic teaching on this subject and to act upon it, man must\nhave an unbounded faith in the Veda. To have an unbounded faith in the Veda is\nto have an unbounded faith in the Guru who gives voice to the teaching which\ntakes the form of the Veda. \'Veda\' literally means \'wisdom\'; and the sacred\nword we now call Veda derives its sanctity and authority from the fact that it\n[embodies](errata.htm#4) wisdom taught by the\n\np. xxviii\n\n[paragraph continues] Divine Merciful Teachers for the guidance of man in his\nonward march of spiritual progress. These wise and disinterested Teachers who\nhold a Divine commission as spiritual instructors of the growing humanity can\ngive utterance to nothing but truth. A true conception, therefore, of the\nlofty nature and the high functions of a spiritual Teacher will necessarily\nend in an utmost reverence and exalted love for Him, without which none can\nfully realise the truths taught by Him. To perceive a truth as fully as the\nGuru does, one should look at it from as many standpoints as the Teacher does;\nthat is to say, the disciple\'s mind must be _en rapport_ with that of the\nTeacher. A complete resignation on the part of the disciple to the will of the\nTeacher and an unbounded love for Him, a feeling of _Bhakti_ or devout love to\nthe Teacher, cannot but serve to remove the barrier which arrests the flow of\nwisdom from the Teacher to the disciple. Once the barrier is removed they come\nso close together that the truths which are stored up in the Teacher\'s mind\nwill flow, as it were, in a continuous stream to the mind of the disciple\nthrough the conduit of complete sympathy opened by love. It is with such\nfeelings of devotion and love that the disciple should approach the Guru. It\nmay not be that the typical Guru, the Teacher who originally delivered\nteaching, is always present in the physical\n\np. xxix\n\nbody before the student\'s eyes. Still, when one wishes to learn anything from\nthe accredited record of His teaching, one must image the true typical Guru\nand revere Him in the heart. The student should always devoutly turn his heart\nin an ardent and devout love towards the Great Personage that realised the\ntruth and gave it out for the benefit of those who cared to avail themselves\nof it. What is generally called Revelation is a record of such teachings. Very\noften the truth thus taught is not recorded in a tangible form, it being\nhanded down from generation to generation by mere word of mouth. The\nteachings, rather the traditions, thus handed down become mutilated and\ncorrupt in the course of long ages and stand in need of interpretation by\nothers who, having got an insight into the truth, can supply omissions and\nsift the genuine teaching from the accumulated accretions of ages. These\ndisinterested visible custodians of the records and their interpreters, who\nare, as it were, the representatives of the Teacher or Teachers who gave voice\nto the truths preserved in the form in which they have come to us, should also\nbe revered and loved as teachers in proportion as they approach the typical\nGuru in point of wisdom and moral excellence. But a thorough realisation of\nthe nature and position of the typical Teacher united with an abiding devotion\nof love towards Him is necessary if the disciple would avoid the\n\np. xxx\n\nmany pitfalls of errors that beset him all through the line of his spiritual\nprogress.\n\n6\\. The truths recorded in the Veda are intended as a help to man\'s onward\nprogress. Knowledge obtained by the mind elaborating upon the materials\nsupplied by the sense-organs of the body coming in contact with external\nobjects can never lead the man of the physical body to look for a world beyond\nthe sphere of the senses, or to think of himself,--his real Self, his true\nEgo,--as an entity not dying with the body. It is the Veda that tells him that\nthere is a world beyond the visible earth; that man, after the body dies,\ncontinues to live in other regions subject to pleasure and pain. Laying down\nrules of conduct and chalking out the path which one has tread in order to\nreach happy regions after death, the Veda serves to widen the range of man\'s\nexperience and knowledge. The happiness thus secured in the life after death\nis exactly in proportion to the effort made while alive on earth in the\ndirection pointed out by the Veda, just as it is down here on earth where\nman\'s pleasures are in proportion to his efforts. After enjoying all the\nhappiness he is entitled to, man returns to earth again to take birth in a\nbody, just as surely as he returns from sleep to the waking state. Thus\nalternately man, rather his Ego, lives on earth and the world or worlds\n\np. xxxi\n\nbeyond, experiencing pleasure and pain, and thus gaining the knowledge which\nenables the Ego to distinguish right from wrong, good from evil. This power of\ndiscrimination manifests itself as conscience sitting in judgment over man\'s\nconduct in daily life and warning him against many possible dangers of evil\nconduct.\n\n7\\. When the Ego has enjoyed all the pleasures afforded by the earth and the\nworlds beyond which he has been traversing all through, a sort of satiation is\nat length produced. Then man no longer feels attracted by the prospects of\npleasure enjoyable in this world or in the worlds beyond; nor does he indulge,\nwith the same zest as before, in the pleasures which come to him of their own\naccord. He then realises the Vedic teaching that all the temporal pleasures,\ncelestial as well as earthly, which, as having been brought into existence by\nhuman effort, cannot form the inherent nature of the Ego, are comparatively\nshort-lived. He further sees that through all the varying enjoyments of\npleasure interspersed with moments of suffering, he himself--his soul or Ego,\n--remains ever the same, without undergoing any change. This leads him to more\nthan suspect that the Ego is an entity distinct from the pleasures and pains,\ndistinct from the body, and the organs, as distinct from them as from the\n\np. xxxii\n\nexternal objects of pleasure. While feeling thus, man finds himself unable to\nget away from the body and the sense-organs which subject him to suffering:\nwhich are a constant source of suffering interspersed no doubt with a few\nmoments of pleasure. In the state of helplessness, man yearns for more help.\nThen the Teacher, or His voice in the shape of the Veda, comes to man\'s help.\nHe is now distinctly taught that the soul is quite distinct from the body and\nthe sense-organs, and that it is possible for man to release\n[himself](errata.htm#5) from the thraldom to which he is now subjected. As a\nfirst step on the path to this goal, the disciple is enjoined to discharge all\nthe duties allotted to his station in life,--to observe the whole daily\nroutine of life which he feels himself bound to go through as belonging to a\nparticular caste and a particular religious order,--as perfectly and\ncheerfully as possible, leaving aside all self-interest in the work, with the\nsole purpose of obeying the command of the Teacher or God whom he adores and\nloves so much so that His pleasure constitutes, for the time being, the main\nend in view in all his actions.\n\n8\\. When some progress has been made in this line of devotion, the disciple\'s\nconception of the universe in all its extent and variety is enlarged by the\nTeacher giving him in outline the constitution of the system of the worlds to\nwhich he\n\np. xxxiii\n\nbelongs, and gradually leading the disciple to have a tolerable view of the\nwhole universe of which that system forms a part. The disciple is then taken\nthrough a course of contemplation which [develops](errata.htm#6) his power of\nconcentration and makes him realise in some detail the nature of the universe\nin which he plays his part. All this course is necessary to purify the heart\nand to strengthen the intellect, so that the disciple may be morally and\nintellectually prepared to receive instruction in the grand truths as to the\nessential nature of man\'s True Ego, or Atman, and the ultimate goal he has to\nreach.\n\n9\\. Now, the Teacher, or the Upanishad which is the verbal expression of His\nteaching to be given at this stage, teaches as follows: Atman, _i.e._ , the\ntrue Self of man, is eternal, ever pure in His essential nature, not subject\nin Himself to birth and death, or to pain and pleasure. His essential nature\nis Consciousness and Bliss. He is the One Existence whence all creatures come\ninto being; wherein they live, move and have their being; and whither they\nwill all return at the time of dissolution. The Ego in man is one with the\nUniversal Ego; Jiva and Isvara, are one. The ultimate end of man consists in\nrealising this unity of Jiva and Isvara, in realising that Atman is one in\nall. Man cannot get out of the earthly life of alternate pleasure and pain for\ngood and\n\np. xxxiv\n\nattain to a state of eternal conscious bliss, till he intuitively realises\nthat he is not the wretched miserable soul of the world with a limited\nknowledge and bliss; that, on the other hand, he is one with Isvara, with the\nUniversal Ego, perfect in knowledge and bliss which are in themselves eternal\nand never obscured.\n\n10\\. When the disciple is taught this grand truth, there naturally arises a\ndoubt as to how this can be. The Upanishad as well as the Teacher points out\nthe line of argument by which the disciple may form a fair intellectual\nconception of it. But a mere intellectual assent to the truth of the\nproposition does not amount to that realisation which consists in the\nindividual Ego feeling and acting as if he is one with the Universal Ego, with\nIsvara himself. To this end man must intently dwell in thought on the Divine\nBeing, the universal Ego, while regarding himself and Isvara and the\n[spiritual](errata.htm#7) Teacher as the one Atman; loving the atman, the\nDivine Self, above all, as his own very Self, casting away the limited self as\nsomething non-existent, keeping away from the mind all alien thoughts, being\ncompletely immersed in Him as both the end and the means in one. Gradually the\nlight of the Divine Sun sheds its lustre upon the ever-expanding and purifying\nmeans, by which the soul sees better in the light of the omniscient wisdom of\nIsvara. The\n\np. xxxv\n\never-increasing knowledge of the real truth only heightens his love and\ndevotion to Isvara. By thus constantly dwelling on the Divine Self in loving\nmeditation, the mind is purged of all its dross and becomes perfectly pure.\nWhen the Buddhi becomes completely serene, Isvara, the Divine Self, is\nreflected in it as He is, and then Jiva becomes one with Isvara, the Buddhi\nbeing absorbed in His all-illumining and all-absorbing Light. Then he has\nreached the goal of the path; he has been liberated; he has attained nirvana,\nthe supreme self-conscious Bliss.\n\n11\\. One cannot reach the _summum bonum_ indicated above without attaining\nperfection in knowledge and devotion. Both the intellect and the heart must be\nequally expanded and perfected before a thorough intuitive realisation of\none\'s own True Self can be attained. They must in short combine into unity in\nthe Self. At any particular stage of spiritual progress of man, his intellect\nand heart may be found to have not reached the same stage of progress. Some\nare more devotional than intellectual, some more intellectual than devotional.\nBut neither of them can be developed very far without the aid of the other or\nwithout stimulating that other to further development. An intense devotion to\nthe Divine Being or to the Teacher however vaguely imaged will not fail to\nlead the intellect to see more clearly the nature of man in\n\np. xxxvi\n\nhis relation to the Divine Being and the universe. Again a better and truer\nconception of the nature and position of the Teacher or of the Divine Being\ngives a better shape to the idea of the Divinity and makes devotion more and\nmore definite and intense. Thus acting and reacting upon each other, knowledge\nand devotion attain perfection till they unite into one in Atman,--a unity\nwhich is beyond the power of all words to express and beyond the power of all\nthought to conceive.\n\n12\\. It has been seen that, as a first step to the ultimate goal man should\nhave a fair intellectual conception of himself and the universe around, as\nalso of his relation to the universe and other beings therein. Evidently man\nis destined to ascend some day to the level of the Omniscient Lord, since, in\nevery man who has risen above the mere animal life of sensation and reached a\ncertain stage of intellectual development, there is an inherent desire to look\nat the nature around and try to find the mutual relations of things therein\nand his own place among them. Curiously enough, at every stage of the enquiry\nhe finds something yet to know and eagerly looks for some guidance, come\nwhence it may. Sometimes the requisite help comes in the form of a suggestion\nfrom within, taking the shape of a hypothesis, for which there seems to be no\nsufficient foundation in the former experience. More rarely, and at long\nintervals, it comes to him\n\np. xxxvii\n\nin the form of a revelation, as the voice of a teacher preaching\ntranscendental truths which are somewhat above his immediate comprehension,\nand which clearly to understand he has to intensely strain all his\nintellectual powers. In trying to grasp the truth, he gets a more\ncomprehensive view of the universe. Such is the gradual, slow but sure, growth\nof intellect stimulated at every step by doubts and failures which are in\ntheir turn followed by slight but encouraging glimpses of truth. This gradual\nprogress has been going on for ages, and traces of the long course of enquiry\nis left in the history of every nation. The Indian literature now extant bears\nample testimony to the assiduity with which the intellectual enquiry has been\ncarried on under varying conditions. The systems of philosophy to which the\nIndian mind has given birth range from the ultra-materialistic system of a\nCharvaka to the most sublime ultraspiritual system of the Vedanta. It must,\nhowever, be borne in mind that all these apparently most divergent systems of\nthought are necessary steps through which the intellect of man must pass and\nhas passed, marking as they do the various stages of man\'s intellectual\ndevelopment. The various systems have bee intended as the training ground for\nthe varying intellects of man, one system leading to another, each man\nhonestly taking to that system of thought which appeals to\n\np. xxxviii\n\nhim most, as best suited to the grain of his mind, as the system which to him\nappears to embody rules of conduct based on a most rational basis. When the\ndifferent systems are viewed in this light, when the value of even the most\nmaterialistic philosophy of a Charvaka is recognised as perforce gradually in\nthe course of enquiry leading the intellect to a less materialistic and more\nspiritual system, the intellect finding no rest till it lands upon the most\nconvicting truth, it becomes easy to understand what the author of the Purana\nmeans when he speaks of the different systems of faith in the following terms:\n\n"Listen with faith, O sages, to what I say as to the truth of the various\npaths. Vedas, Dharmasastras, Purana, Bharata, Vedangas and minor Vedas; Kamika\nand other agamas; Kapala and Lakula in all their variety; the Pasupata, Soma,\nBhairava and other agamas with their hundred varieties: Vaishnava and Brahma\nagamas; the agamas of the Buddhas and the Arhats; Lokayata, and the\nTarkasastras in all their vastness; the profound Mimamsa, as also Sankhya and\nYoga; all these and many more Sastras, the Omniscient Divine Being has made in\nbrief. It is only by the Grace of Rudra that Devas like Brahma and Vishnu,\nSiddhas, Vidyadharas, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Munis and men make the Sastras\nagain, in brief or in extenso. The wise say that each of these sastras is\nintended for a particular class according to the individual qualification, not\nall for one. These paths are not to be rudely handled by the learned\nsubjecting them to rigorous unrelenting logic. As all streams ultimately empty\nthemselves into the ocean, so all these\n\np. xxxix\n\npaths ultimately lead to the Mahesvara Himself. Worshipped in what form soever\nby people as ordained in their respective scriptures. He assumes that form and\ntakes the devotee on to the next higher step, By His Grace man attains to\nsuperior paths. The Divine Being worshipped in the form in which He is\nrepresented in these paths takes the devotee step by step onward to the path\nof the Veda. The form which the Divine Being assumes in the path of the Veda\nis the immediate cause of salvation. Even there the form of the Divine Being\nas represented by the ritualistic portion of the Veda only stimulates a\nlonging for knowledge; while, worshipped in the form presented in the\ntheosophical portion He leads the devotee to moksha through wisdom.\n\n"As the highest salvation is only of one kind, the knowledge which leads to it\nmust be of one kind and of one kind\' only. The Vedanta treats of Sankara as\nthe non-dual Atman. No other path treats of Him directly as the Vedanta does.\nTherefore knowledge produced by the Veda is alone wisdom. Knowledge obtained\nby other means is avidya, unwisdom. The other paths cannot themselves lead to\nmoksha; they are serviceable only as leading to it through the intervening\nsteps. Mahadeva, as known by the Vedanta, directly gives moksha; as known and\nworshipped in the other paths He leads to moksha by gradually taking the soul\non to the direct path. Wherefore he who treads the path of the Vedanta should\nnot change it for any other. To those who tread the path of the Veda, nothing\nis hard to attain. There alone lie the supreme mukti and other enjoyments in\nplenty.\n\n"Wherefore the different paths are useful to the different individuals for\nwhom they are specially intended. Whenever other paths are opposed to the\nVedanta in their theories as to the nature of Isvara, as to the cause of\nbondage,\n\np. xl\n\nas to the cause of the Universe, as to mukti, and as to what constitutes\nwisdom, and so on, those theories, to be sure, have been furnished in\naccordance with the prevailing desires of the ignorant whose minds are\ndarkened by the mighty delusion: not because they are absolutely true in\nthemselves, but because they serve, by holding out some legitimate pleasures\nto ultimately bring them round to the right path when their sins have been\nwashed away in the waters of the more or less pure morality therein\ninculcated. As man allures an erratic cow by holding out grass, so does\nMahesvara first hold out some pleasure and then gives supreme wisdom as the\nmind becomes perfected.\n\n"Thus these paths, laid out as they are by Siva, are all of them true and\nserviceable. How can Siva be a deceiver? He is supremely merciful, omniscient,\nand altogether stainless. Yet of all the paths, the path of the Veda is the\nbest. as conducing to all good." (Skanda-Purana, Suta-Samhita, _Yajna-\nVaibhava-Khanda, 22nd adhyaya_ ).\n\nThis unique attitude of the Purana towards the several antagonistic systems of\nreligion and philosophy only gives expression to the consciousness of the fact\nthat mankind, made up as it is of different individuals who have reached\ndifferent stages of intellectual and moral progress, cannot all think to\norder, in one and the same way, in their honest attempt to understand their\nposition in the universe and to find the standard which they should follow in\nall their acts with a view to attaining the highest goal which they think it\nworth their while to strive for. Though\n\np. xli\n\nas a race the major portion of mankind has reached a certain stage of\ndevelopment, the progress made by different individuals composing the race--or\neven a nation which forms a component part of the race--varies between very\nwide limits, so that all the different systems of philosophy and religion find\ntheir adherents in a race or a nation at any one particular period of its\ndevelopment. In the Aryan race these systems seem to have prevailed in some\nform or other ever since the beginning of history, and there are, no doubt, at\nthe present moment, thinkers of no mean order whose intellectual sympathies\nincline to the ultra-materialistic system of Charvaka or to some other system\nlying between that and the most spiritual system of Vedanta, so that any\nattempt at tracing an historical order of the origin and development of the\ndifferent systems of philosophy may not prove quite so fruitful. In tracing,\nhowever, the psychological order of intellectual development as represented by\nthe Indian systems of philosophy which correspond to the several stages\nthereof, those systems may perhaps range themselves in an order which may\nroughly correspond to the original historical order of their development.\n\n13\\. As has been shown above, when there arises a necessity to widen man\'s\nexperience beyond the limited range of the senses, the necessity\n\np. xlii\n\nexpresses itself as a yearning on the part of man for pleasures more durable\nand intense than the earth can afford, or than his limited vision can suggest\nresources for; and then he is furnished, under Divine Dispensation, with a\ncode of ethics and ritual by Teachers who are detailed to the work by the\nDivine Providence. By duly acting up to it, he attains to unearthly pleasures\nhereafter. Under the immediate guidance of the Divine Teachers, or the Divine\nKing-sages, the people follow the law with unbounded faith. But when these\nDivine Guides give up the _role_ of direct Instructors with a view to\nstrengthen human intellect by stimulating in it a spirit of independent\nenquiry and thought on the materials of thought thus supplied, _i.e._ , when\nthere is no visible Divine Personage in the person of a Mann or an Ikshvaku,\nto whom an appeal can be made by those whose faith in things invisible is\nshaken the least by any circumstance whatsoever, all but those few who find\nsome reason to adhere to the received teachings as to the unseen world turn to\ntheir ordinary experience for guidance. In course of time a thorough reaction\nis produced in their minds against that unquestioning faith of the orthodox\nwhich culminates in a stupendous system of priestcraft and an almost\nmeaningless ritualism born of ignorance and selfishness gathering themselves\nround the pure central core of a scientific ritual. This strong reactionary\n\np. xliii\n\nspirit runs so much against the orthodox system that it accepts nothing as\ntrue except what the senses reveal, not even the recorded truths commonly\naccepted as Revelation and which form the basis of orthodox belief. It places\nno trust even in matters of inference. Thus the conclusion is inevitable that\nnothing is left behind after death; that there can be no life after death for\nwhich one should prepare while still alive here on earth. The result is an\nextreme materialistic sensualism or a low form of utilitarianism forming the\nrule of conduct. This system of thought forms the faith of a Charvaka. Though\nthe system may satisfy the sensualist who wants to shake himself off all\nrestrictions put on his libertine tendencies, its conclusions cannot commend\nthemselves to the enquiring man who, as having already experienced heavenly\npleasures, feels a sense of complete dissatisfaction about the mere earthly\npleasures, and a secret and inexpressible longing for the celestial pleasures\nof even a more intense kind than he has already tasted. Though not quite\nagreeing with the orthodox ritualist who honestly exercises all the powers of\nhis intellect with a view to find a rational basis for the received code of\nmorality and ceremonial, yet the honest heterodox thinker cannot subscribe to\nall the conclusions to which the materialistic philosophy has led him,\nundermining all the basis of morality; and he follows\n\np. xliv\n\nsome rules of moral conduct which he formulates for himself in the light of\nhis own conscience which has by this time under the impress of his former\nexperience developed into a faculty.\n\n14\\. This spirit of enquiry has served to stimulate the intellect of the\northodox as well as the heterodox thinker to that pitch of thought at which it\nis prepared to take a further step in advance with a little more light on\ntheir path. Both alike feel somewhat dissatisfied with all the pleasures the\nearth and heaven can afford, temporary as they are, lasting short or long in\naccordance with the intensity of the effort made to secure them, and always\nmixed with anxiety and care about their duration. While in this state of mind,\nthe Divine Teacher comes once more to their help and throws out slight hints\nas to the possibility of freeing oneself from the ever-revolving wheel of\nbirth and death and attain to a state of happiness untainted by pain, a state\nof being in which one will he free from all pain and will never return to the\nearthly life wherein pleasure and pain alternate with each other. The Teacher\nsets at rest their uneasy mind by declaring that this life of pain and\npleasure is at best temporary and that freedom from pain can be obtained by\nknowing things as they are in their true relations. The Divine Teacher lays\ndown a brief sketch of the\n\np. xlv\n\norigin of the world and of the path which man has to tread with a view to\nobtain liberation. Inspired by this teaching, both the orthodox and the\nheterodox classes of thinkers set themselves to work. The orthodox thinkers\nstill hold to the Veda as the standard by which the truth of the results of\ntheir intellectual speculation should be measured, and in course of time they\nadd to the Veda the fresh block of teachings as part and parcel of it under\nthe name of Upanishads; while the heterodox, carrying on their old reactionary\nspirit against ritualism into the realm of theosophy, deny all authority to\nRevelation as such. The orthodox thought assumes in course of time the forms\nof Vaiseshika, Nyaya, Sankhya, and Yoga systems, while the heterodox thought\ngives birth in the long run, to something like the Buddhistic and Arhata\n(Jain) systems of philosophy.\n\n15\\. The thinkers of orthodox type try to cast all the knowledge they have\nacquired by Revelation into a systematic form. The chief object of their\nattempt at systematisation is to overthrow the materialistic system of\nCharvaka; and for this they have to perfect their logic. They have accordingly\ndeveloped a complete system of logic by which they seek to establish the\ntruths contained in the scripture independently of all aid from scripture. In\ntheir zeal to silence the Charvakas\n\np. xlvi\n\nwho recognise no other source of knowledge than _pratyaksha_ or sensuous\nperception, they have given undue prominence to _anumana_ or empirical\ninference as the one sufficient instrument by which all things worth knowing\ncan be known and proved. When the scripture is apparently at variance with the\nfindings of logic, it is so interpreted as not to offend the conclusions\nalleged to have been arrived at by independent reasoning.--I say \'alleged\'\nbecause it is the Revelation which has made them think of the soul, God, etc.,\nwhose existence could never have been suggested by mere empirical reasoning.\nThis method of investigation cannot but vitiate thee system, so far as it\nrelates to the subject which falls within the special province of Revelation.\nThe laws of reasoning are primarily based on relations of agreement and\ndifference among external objects, and as such they may hold good when dealing\nwith things which are experienced as external to the entity that perceives\nthem, and which thus fall within the ken of the sense-organs by which\nimpressions of external objects are received. They are found most potent\ninstruments in finding out the relations of one object to. another in the\nexternal world, and all sciences relating to gross material things outside the\nSelf are based on those laws. But when the same laws are rigorously applied to\nthings beyond the ken of sense-organs, especially when they are\n\np. xlvii\n\nextended to the region of the causes which have produced the phenomena we\nperceive, when they are resorted to in investigating the nature of Atman, the\ntrue Self who is quite unlike anything experienced by him for the very reason\nthat He is the experiencer and all other things are experienced by Him,--when\nthose laws which are based on the relations of phenomena to one another are\nappealed to in determining the relations between the phenomena on the one side\nand the Atman on the other, the conclusions arrived at cannot, of course,\ntally with truths exactly as they are declared in the scriptures which are the\nrecords of the ultimate verities realised by the Initiates in their Divine\nSamadhi. If some of the conclusions on transcendental matters arrived at by\nthis method of investigation correspond to the reality, it is because the\ncourse of reasoning by which they have been arrived at is primarily, though\nperhaps unconsciously, inspired by the truths made known by Revelation. Not\ninfrequently, the very line of argument adopted is already found sketched\nbriefly in the scriptures; and, but for hints contained in the scriptures; the\nparticular line of argument in question, as quite unique in itself, could not\nhave occurred to the unaided reasoning. Hence it is that while the systems\nbased on this method of investigation exhibit a tolerable degree of agreement\nin the analysis of\n\np. xlviii\n\nexperience as to matters lying outside Atman who is the subject of all\nexperiences, there is utmost divergence in their conclusions as to the First\nCause of the Universe, as to the nature of Isvara and Atman, as to the cause\nof bondage, as to the nature and means of liberation.\n\n16\\. The Tarkikas (Vaiseshikas and Naiyayikas) hold that the material universe\nis created out of the extremely fine atoms of matter acted on by the will of\nthe Omniscient and Omnipotent Isvara. The soul is in itself an insentient\nentity rendered conscious by its union with manas through which it suffers\npleasure and pain. The soul which is eternal identifies itself with the body,\netc., on account of ignorance, and feels that it is born and dead with the\nbody and thus suffers a lot of pain. The one means of attaining liberation is\nto destroy ignorance by knowledge of truth, obtained through the grace of the\nDivine Being, by meditating on the object of the right knowledge. By this\nknowledge of truth false notions disappear. When false notions disappear all\nthe evil passions pass away; with them ceases activity; with it ceases birth,\nand with the cessation of birth, comes the annihilation of pain, which is the\nfinal bliss. The final bliss consists in perfect obliviousness to all: being\nfreed from\n\nmanas, the soul is unconscious of anything, being in itself quite an\ninsentient entity.\n\n17\\. According to some of the Sankhyas, the material universe is evolved out\nof the one all-pervading insentient essence of matter called Pradhana, acting\nunder the influence of a sentient Isvara who enters into it by way of being\nreflected in it; while there are other Sankhyas who hold that there is no such\nBeing called Isvara, and that the one Pradhana evolves, of itself, into the\nuniverse of manifold existence. Creation, they say, is effected by mutually\ndependent Nature (Prakriti) and Soul, Prakriti not evolving without the\nconscious Soul, and the Soul not achieving its emancipation without Nature\'s\nevolution. All pain is due to the Soul--which is in itself free from pain--\nfalsely identifying itself with the intellect which is evolved out of Nature\n(Prakriti). By contemplation of truth the Soul is enabled to discriminate\nbetween Nature and Soul, and then a final separation takes place. _Kaivalya_\nor absolute isolation has been attained: the result is final bliss. In this\nstate of bliss the Soul remains pure consciousness, Nature manifesting itself\nnever more to the vision of the soul.\n\n18\\. The Nyaya and Sankhya schools have based their intellectual speculation\non the teaching of the accepted Revelation, never disputing the matters of\nfact detailed therein: and they may be\n\np. l\n\nso far considered orthodox. The heterodox thinkers, who find themselves unable\nto subscribe to the elaborate doctrine of Vedic ritual, lay the axe of\nspeculation at the very root of it by way of denying the persistent existence\nof the soul, so that there is none who, doing an act at present, will, in a\nfuture period, reap the fruits thereof. They attach no value to the time-\nhonored Veda which teaches among other things a long and to them indefensible\ncourse of rituals; but they substitute in its place scriptures containing a\nbody of teachings treating mostly of pure morality and purporting to have been\ndelivered by an Omniscient Teacher, a Buddha or an Arhat. Such are the\nBuddhists and the Arhats. The former hold as follows: There is no Isvara, no\none eternally existent God who is the creator of the universe. Everything in\nthe universe including the soul is _sui generis_ , born of itself, and exists\nonly for an instant, not having existed before nor existing after that one\ninstant of its existence. All is pain; and the bondage of the soul consists in\nlooking upon the self and the universe, by ignorance and consequent karma, as\nsomething continuously existent. When, by deep meditation of the truth that\neverything is painful, momentary, _sui generis_ , and non-existent before and\nafter, the soul recognises its own momentariness as well as the momentariness\nof all else, liberation is attained. Liberation consists in pure detached\nstates of consciousness\n\np. li\n\nfollowing one upon another in a continuous stream without being tainted by\nexternal objects of perception; or, according to the Nihilist, it consists in\neverything, including the soul, being reduced in knowledge to a non-entity, to\nan absolute void.\n\n19\\. The followers of the Arhats, on the other hand, reject the Buddhistic\ndoctrine of momentariness of everything and accord to the universe a sort of\ncontinued existence. They advocate the continuous existence of the soul which,\nneither infinitesimally small nor infinitely great, occupies a limited space,\ndoing acts at present and reaping the fruits thereof in future. With the\nBuddhists, they deny the existence of one eternal God,--of one independent and\nall-pervading creator of the universe,--while admitting the existence of an\nomniscient Being who has overcome all faults and shaken off all bonds of\nexistence in the ordinary process of soul-evolution. The universe comes out of\natoms by the action of individual karma. Everything is made up of something\neternal and of something non-eternal. The bondage consists in the soul\nassuming, as the result of sin and false intuition, various bodies occupying\nlimited parts of space. Liberation is the absolute release from action by the\ndecay of the causes of bondage and existence. "It is the abiding in the\nhighest regions, the soul being absorbed in bliss, with its knowledge\nunhindered, and its bliss\n\np. lii\n\nuntainted by any pain or impression thereof." It is secured by right knowledge\nobtained through an absolute faith in the teaching of an Arhat, by right\nconduct, and by abstaining from all actions tending to evil.\n\n20\\. In its struggle against the materialists of the Charvaka type, the\nintellect has attained a high stage of development; and, as a result, a\ncomplete system of logic has been formulated. But the conclusions based on\nmere intellectual speculation concerning matters which rise far above the\nloftiest reaches of the intellect cannot always subserve the cause of truth.\nIt has been seen how much at variance, as regards the ultimate problems, are\nthe few typical systems above referred to, which seek to prove everything by\nreason. In speculating about the transcendental, each theorist tries to outwit\nthe other by resorting to reasoning, and thus a host of warring systems have\ncome into being. This result soon leads to reaction. When reasoning is\nexclusively resorted to for guidance in an enquiry as to the matters which do\nnot fall within the scope of the sense-organs, the conclusions are often at\nvariance with truth. The laws of reasoning are based primarily upon relations\nof objects as perceived by the sense organs; and the sense-organs lend to the\nobjects of perception their own colour and conditions which make them appear\ndifferent from what\n\np. liii\n\nthey really are; so that the systems of philosophy based on mere intellectual\nspeculation are vitiated by the inherent defects of the instruments employed\nin obtaining knowledge. The systems, therefore, that are entirely based on\nintellectual speculation, discarding all light from the accepted Revelation--\nsimply because the religions based on Revelation have inculcated practices\nwhich demand blind faith at first and which afterwards during the long lapse\nof ages grow into an elaborate and somewhat meaningless ceremonial--are\nfarther removed from the teachings of True Revelation as to the right path of\nprogress than those which are mainly guided by Revelation, though pretending\nto establish by independent reasoning the truths taught therein.\n\n21\\. As a corrective to the foregoing methods of investigation which have led\nto a distortion of revealed truths, it is sought to get at the revealed truths\nfirst-hand, by interpreting the scriptures as they stand according to the\nprinciples of construction by which ordinary speech uttered by a trustworthy\nperson is construed, For a clear understanding of the teaching of the\nscriptures thus made out, it should also be reconciled with experience by\nresorting to logic, clearly distinguishing, however, the facts which can be\nproved by empirical logic,--the logic based on ordinary experience--and those\nwhich cannot be so proved, but whose understanding can be made clearer by\npursuing\n\np. liv\n\nsuch a course of logic as will not lead to a conclusion quite opposed to the\nrevealed teaching. In the latter case, no modification is introduced, on the\nstrength of the laws which obtain among objects of sensuous perception, into\nthe body of the teachings as made out by an independent interpretation of the\nscriptural texts; the Revelation being intended to throw light upon such\nthings only as are quite beyond the limited scope of intellect and sense-\norgans. Such, in brief, is the method of the Mimamsa school. In their attempt\nto-find out the import of the Veda interpreted by itself, undistorted by the\nintervention of human reason, the Mimamsakas have developed a complete system\nof the general principles of construction, according to which all revealed\ntexts should be interpreted.\n\n22\\. The system thus constructed out of the contents of the .Veda is called\nMimamsa, an enquiry into the meaning of the Veda. It is divided into two great\nsections: one dealing with rituals,. the other with the soul and the universe;\nrespectively termed Purva-Mimamsa or simply Mimamsa,. and the Uttara-Mimasa;\nthe latter being also. known as Sariraka-Mimamsa, an enquiry into the nature\nof the embodied soul, but more popularly spoken of as the Brahma-Sutras or\neven as Vedanta-sutras. Though these two form two sections of one whole\nsystem, still in later history,\n\np. lv\n\nthey have come to hold quite divergent views concerning some of the\nfundamental questions. Thus while the Vedantins look upon the universe as\nevolved out of an eternal Omniscient Isvara, the Mimamsakas admit no sort of\nOmniscient Being and regard the universe as having evolved out of atoms of\nmatter acted on by the karma of individuals. Mimamsakas hold that salvation is\nattained by the works prescribed in the Veda, whereas the Vedantins maintain\nthat all effects of actions being more, or less transient, eternal salvation\ncan be attained by no other means than knowledge, for which an unselfish\nperformance of the works prescribed in the Veda can but prepare the mind by\nway of purifying it. It is the Mimamsakas of the post-Buddhistic period that\nhave been led to hold views so opposed to the Vedanta; a position which they\nhave had to assume owing to the exigencies of time. They had to establish the\nauthority of the Veda as a scripture against the Buddhist\'s anathemas, most of\nwhich were directed chiefly against the ritualistic portion of the Vedic\nteaching. To this end the importance of the Vedic ritual has been so much\nemphasised--as a piece of rhetoric--that it has come to be held as the main\npoint of the teaching. It is held that nothing else is necessary for\nsalvation, and that it is attained by avoiding all prohibited actions, by\ndoing nothing with a selfish motive and thus generating no new\n\np. lvi\n\n[paragraph continues] Karma necessitating rebirth, and by a strict observance\nof the obligatory duties which wash away all sins. The denial of the existence\nof an Omniscient Being is traceable to the Mimamsaka\'s zeal to abolish the\nauthority of the Buddhistic and Arhata Scriptures looked upon by their\nfollowers as the deliverances of Omniscient Beings,--of those who in the\nnatural course of spiritual progress have shaken off the bonds of flesh and\nattained perfection in knowledge. As against these the Mimamsaka defends the\nauthority of the Veda on the ground that it is eternal and self-existent,--not\nthe production of a mind, not even of the mind of an Omniscient Eternal\nIsvara, whose very existence he denies. Those passages in the Upanishads which\ntreat of Isvara are explained away by the Mimamsaka as serving, at best, to\nfurnish an imaginary form or forms--having no real objective existence--upon\nwhich the soul should contemplate in order to attain to the highest state of\nBliss in Moksha.\n\n23\\. The Vedantin, on the other hand, looks upon the Mimamsa as an enquiry\ninto the ritualistic portion of the Veda treating of the ceremonial\nobservances which every man has to go through before he is qualified to enter\non the path of knowledge. But he deprecates against the Mimamsaka regarding\nthe Upanishads as not pointing to the real objective existence of Brahman, the\neternal\n\np. lvii\n\n[paragraph continues] Omniscient Isvara, from whom the whole universe has come\ninto existence, and in whom it has its being He further contends that by the\nmere observance of Vedic ritual none can attain everlasting Bliss; that, on\nthe other hand, the highest bliss can be attained by knowledge alone which\nremoves the ignorance that has blinded the vision of the soul to truth and\nthereby led to all the numerous evils which are collectively named _samsara-\nbandha_ , the bondage of mundane existence. Interpreting the Upanishads, upon\nwhich the Vedanta Doctrine is mainly based, according to the rules of\nconstruction formulated in the [course](errata.htm#8) of enquiry into the\ncontents of the Karma kanda or the ritualistic portion of the Veda, the\nBrahmavadin comes to the conclusion that the Upanishads inculcate the\nexistence of Brahman, an [all-pervading](errata.htm#9) Principle, the one\nExistence whence the whole universe has come into being. Brahman as Isvara is\nnot only the Divine Intelligence who controls and guides the evolution of the\nwhole universe; Fie is also present in every thing that we perceive or think\nof, as its very basis, as its material cause, just as clay exists in the pot\nas its material cause. While agreeing thus far generally as against the other\nsystems of philosophy, the different schools of Vedanta differ very widely\nfrom one another as regards the views they hold as to God, the individual\nSoul, the universe, and their mutual relations:\n\np. lviii\n\nall the schools, curiously enough, basing their divergent views on the\nauthority of the one class of writings named Upanishads. The dualists, the\nfollowers of Sri Madhvacharya, hold that the three are quite distinct from one\nanother, every individual soul being quite distinct from every other soul, and\nevery material object being quite distinct from every other. The followers of\nSri Ramanujacharya try to reduce the whole existence to a unity made up of the\nthree ultimate principles of God, the sentient and the insentient,--all\ninextricably united into one, God being as it were embodied in the other two,\nso that these two have no existence quite independent of God\'s. Like the\ndualists of Madhvacharya\'s school, they hold that the external universe is as\nreal as the soul that perceives it, and that the individual souls of whom the\nsentient existence is composed are really distinct from one another and from\nGod, each having a distinct individual consciousness of his own: the\nindividual souls being absolutely governed by God from within in all their\nthoughts and actions, finding their utmost Bliss, when liberated from the\nbonds of samsara, in an inseparable union with God, in the hearty devotion of\nservice rendered to the All-benign and Most Gracious Master, in the loving\nacknowledgment of the Divine Lord\'s absolute sovereignty over him through\nnever-ending eternity. There are Vedantins of another school\n\np. lix\n\nheaded by Srikantha-Sivacharya, who, like those mentioned above, admit the\nreality of separate existence in the case of individual souls even when\nliberated, but who differ from them only in so far as they hold that the\nliberated soul lives for himself enjoying the inherent unutterable bliss of\nhis own nature as well as the loving blissful presence of the Divine Lord all\naround, not however quite so conscious of his absolute dependence on the\nDivine Being as the followers of Sri Ramanujacharya would have it. Besides the\nsystems of Vedanta now mentioned, there are several others which, like the\nthree foregoing ones, admit the reality of an external universe, either\nexisting quite apart from Atman, or as having actually emanated from Atman.\n\n24\\. Distinguished from all these systems and standing apart by itself is that\nsystem of Vedanta which maintains- an absolute unity of Atman, the One\nReality, whereof all duality is an illusory manifestation. Unlike other\nsystems of philosophy and religion it upholds an absolute identity of God and\nthe individual soul as the One Existence and Light. It teaches that liberation\nfrom the bonds of samsara consists in a complete realisation of this oneness\nof the Self, the liberated soul seeing all in the one true Self and the one\nSelf in all. The whole universe which seems to be so real to an ordinary being\ndoes not at all appear to the liberated\n\np. lx\n\nand if he ever sees the universe at all, he sees it as a manifestation of his\nown Self, of the Omniscient Isvara who, by the power of illusion which is\nalways under His control, can bring into manifestation the whole universe by\nHis own free will. Either way the universe has no real existence apart from\nthe Atman by whose light it appears and in whose being it has its existence.\n\n25\\. Such, in brief, are the main conclusions embodied in the Vedanta Doctrine\nas Sri Sankaracharya has expounded it. As establishing the absolute non-\nduality of the One Self, the One Existence and Light, the system is known as\nthe Advaita-Vada by pre-eminence. The Advaita. Doctrine is developed in all\nits details in the commentaries on the Upanishads, the Bhagavad-gita and\nSariraka-mimamsa-sutras, by its eminent Founder and by his equally eminent\ndisciple and literary collaborator, Suresvaracharya, known respectively as the\nBhashyakara and the Vartikakara,--the one laying down the foundation and\nbuilding the superstructure of the system, and the other filling up the gaps,\nsymmetrising and embellishing the whole. Between them, the Advaita Doctrine is\ncompleted and established against the other systems of philosophy and\nreligion, orthodox as well as heterodox. The main outlines of the system are\ndelineated in a concise and telling form by the Founder in his Dakshinamurti-\nStotra,--an Ode to\n\np. lxi\n\nthe Divinity conceived as the Guru of Gurus,--which serves as the text upon\nwhich the devotee may meditate in the calm moments of his daily life. The\nVartikakara has explained the meaning of this Ode in his work called\nManasollasa, \'brilliant play of thought,\' which renders explicit all that lies\nimplicit in the hymn. Both these works have been literally translated into\nEnglish in the present volume, elucidative notes being added whenever\nnecessary.\n\n26\\. It may be of some help to the beginner to show briefly the process by\nwhich Suresvaracharya has established the non-duality of Atman. Closely\nfollowing the most fundamental principle of Mimamsa that the Veda teaches\nnothing which can be otherwise known, the Vedantin of the Advaita school has\npicked out the four following sentences from the Upanishads,--one from each\nVeda,--as embodying the one grand truth which the Sruti alone can teach:\n\n"Prajnana (Consciousness) is Brahman." ( _Aitareyopanishad_ ).\n\n"I am Brahman." (Brihadaranyaka-Upanishad).\n\n"That thou art." ( _Chhandogya-Upanishad_ ).\n\n"This self is Brahman." ( _Mandukya-Upanishad_ ).\n\nThese four sentences clearly signify the absolute unity of the Self and\nBrahman. Indeed\n\np. lxii\n\nthis truth cannot be arrived at by the intellect and the senses which, by a\nlong-acquired tendency, always look outwards for light and knowledge; and it\nis apparently a truth which is opposed to all human experience. At first sight\nit seems beyond all power of human comprehension to realise that the human Ego\nwhose knowledge and power are so miserably limited is identical with the\nOmniscient and Omnipotent Brahman. Still, evidently for that very reason,--for\nthe reason that Revelation is intended to enlighten man on truths which cannot\nbe known by unaided intellect,--it should be regarded as the main truth\ninculcated in the Upanishad, striking the key note as it were of the Vedanta\ndoctrine. The whole system of Advaita is only an attempt to read human\nexperience in the light of this grand revealed truth. All the writings of\nSankaracharya and Suresvaracharya have this one great purpose in view, namely\nto show that the Revealed Truth does not stultify human understanding, when\nproperly investigated and explained.\n\n27\\. With a view to establish this identity of Isvara and the Self, the\nAdvaita-Vadin tries to show that all that goes to distinguish Jiva and Isvara\nis due to something which is outside their essential nature, to an upadhi or\nmedium through which they are manifested. When manifested through Maya which\nis pure in itself, the One Existence and Light is regarded as the Isvara,\n\np. lxiii\n\nwho, seeing through the medium of pure sattvic Maya completely under His\ncontrol, knows the whole universe and exercises unlimited sway over it. When\nmoving in the sphere of impure Maya and seeing through the coloured spectacles\nof avidya which are made of the glasses of various colours, the One Existence\nand Light appears as so many Jivas with limited ranges of vision, seeing\neverything in the colour of the sense-organs,--of the coloured spectacles--by\nwhich they perceive it. The external objects, _i.e._ , the particular forms in\nwhich the external world, the whole non-ego, is manifested, are all garbs as\nit were vesturing the One Existence and Light that is both within and without,\ngarbs lent to It by the coloured glasses through which It is seen. It is, in\nfact, the One Existence and Light, the one Self, that alone really exists and\nis manifested both within and without, as both the self and the non-self, as\nthe subject and the object. The distinction as subject and object, as the ego\nand the non-ego, is purely a creation of ignorance; and all that one has to do\nto realise the truth is to shake off the sleep of ignorance which presents to\nthe Self the dream of the universe as something real, as something which\nexists outside the Self. Then Atman, the Self, will shine forth in His true\nnature, realising Himself in the whole universe; seeing no universe outside\nHimself,\n\np. lxiv\n\nseeing Himself everywhere and none else anywhere, centred in Himself, as to\nwhom there is not a where or a when. Then He is said to have been awakened\nfrom the sleep of Maya, all His former experience appearing like a dream.\n\n28\\. That Jiva is one with Isvara is indicated by the fact that Jiva is\npossessed of consciousness and activity like Isvara. As possessing unlimited\nconsciousness and activity, Isvara can alone have them inherent in His\nessential nature. They are the essential attributes of Jivas as well, though\napparently of a limited extent. Moreover, all the activities which constitute\nthe world\'s progress have their origin in the will and intelligence of\nsentient beings; and these sentient beings cannot, therefore, but be one with\nthe Isvara, who is said to carry on the world-processes by His own will and\nintelligence. It is, in fact, His will which, reflected in the Jivas, carries\non the various processes by which the universe is maintained. All the\nlimitations to which a Jiva\'s will and intelligence are subject are traceable\nto the upadhis,--to the vehicles or the media through which the Jiva manifests\nhimself as the Ego perceiving all else. A right understanding, therefore, of\nthe essential nature of Atman will consummate in a conviction as to His\nabsolute unity.\n\n29\\. All that appear alien to the Self are only forms ensouled by Him,--in\nwhose being they exist, and by whose light they shine. They are\n\np. lxv\n\ntherefore said to be produced out of the Self as their cause, as the Reality\nunderlying all phenomena. They are only illusory forms of the Self who exists\never the same, unaffected by the forms set up in Him by mere avidya, just as a\nrope remains unaffected as rope all the while that it is mistaken for a\nserpent. These forms, external objects as they are called, have no real being\noutside that of the Self. No object ever shines except when associated with\nthe Ego perceiving it and forming the material basis of the object, as clay is\nthe material basis of a pot. The Atoms and the Pradhana, assumed by the\nTarkikas and the Sankhyas to be the cause of the universe, are only\nhypothetical: or, if they be more than hypothetical, they are the illusory\nforms of Atman, the One Existence and Light. It is because Atman is thus the\nsole cause of the phenomenal universe that the existence and light which\nconstitute the inherent essential nature of Atman are associated with each\nindividual object in the universe, just as clay is found associated with the\nobjects made of it.\n\n30\\. The universe is but an external expression of the will, intelligence and\nactivity of the One Existence. As the universe appears for a time and then\ndisappears, even these last--will, intelligence and activity,--do not\nconstitute the inherent nature of Isvara who exists the same for ever.\nAccordingly, to speak of the universe of\n\np. lxvi\n\nevanescent forms as really existing, or to speak of Isvara as the creator of\nthe universe, is not absolutely true. When external objects are said to exist\nand shine, it is the Self that exists and shines in the forms spoken of as\nsense-objects. In fact, no object ever exists or shines except as the object\nof the consciousness of an Ego, of \'I\'; while the Ego, what we feel as \'I,\'\nexists and shines ever the same, seeing the objects and even their absence.\nThese objects come and go, no individual object having really existed before\nmanifestation nor continuing to exist thereafter. The sense-objects, properly\nspeaking, can have no more real existence than the serpent for which a rope is\nmistaken. One way of realising the universality and unity of the Self is to\nrefer the existence and light, present in all external objects, to the Ego who\nis associated with every object perceived. The one Atman appears as the Ego,--\nas perceiver when manifested in the buddhi, and as agent of actions when\nmanifested in prana. Deluded by Maya, by the mighty power of illusion, the One\nSelf appears as Jiva identifying Himself with the manas and prana in all their\ntransformations. The removal, by knowledge, of the illusion which is the cause\nof samsara is called Moksha or Liberation. When this has been accomplished,\nall limitations created by Maya having disappeared, the Jiva realises his true\nnature as the one\n\np. lxvii\n\n[paragraph continues] Omniscient Atman and recognises the identity of Jiva and\nIsvara.\n\n31\\. Maya and Vidya, illusion and wisdom, are both the mighty potentialities\nof the Lord. By the one He partially conceals His true nature and manifests\nHimself as Jiva; and then by the other which removes the veil of illusion, He\nrealises Himself. Properly speaking, Vidya, the light of wisdom, constitutes\nHis essential nature; but it is spoken of as coming into existence because,\nwhen the curtain of Maya is removed, the inherent light of Atman shines in\nfull in the mind of those from whose vision it has hitherto been obscured,\njust as the sun is said to have his full light restored to him when the shadow\nthat has eclipsed him from our view has been removed.\n\n32\\. What is this Maya or Avidya, which like a shadow eclipses the Omniscient\nSelf? Does it really exist or not? The Advaitin answers as follows: In common\nparlance Maya is a name given to a phenomenon which cannot be accounted for by\nany known laws of nature, and which cannot be said either to exist or not to\nexist. The phenomenon produced by the magician\'s will cannot be said to exist,\nbecause it soon disappears and the magician himself knows that it is an\nillusion. Neither can it be said not to exist at all, because we are conscious\nof the thing, though only for a time; and we are never conscious of a thing\nwhich\n\np. lxviii\n\nis altogether non-existent, such as a man\'s horn. Of a similar character is\nthe phenomenon called the universe which is imagined to be distinct from\nAtman. It is like the silver for which the mother-of-pearl is mistaken. Here\nit is Atman who, owing to the illusion obscuring the mind of the perceiver,\nputs on all the forms which we call external objects. Like all other illusions\nit disappears by knowledge. Enlightened sages as well as the Sruti bear\ntestimony to the fact that, on the dawn of knowledge of the true Self, Maya\ndisappears altogether. It is in this sense,--in the sense that it disappears\nin the light of right knowledge--that the external universe is spoken of as\nunreal, as _mithya_ , as opposed to the self-existent and self-luminous Atman\nwho never ceases to exist and shine.\n\n33\\. He who practises Yoga, restraining the mind from all external objects and\nfixing it on the indwelling Atman, the True Divine Self, gradually overcomes\nthe distracting tendencies of manas. When manas dwells constantly on the\nAtman, it tends to become pure and co-extensive with Him. This process attains\nconsummation when manas, becoming entirely atrophied as to the external\nuniverse, resumes its real form as Atman, and there exists no longer that\nparti-coloured organ by which to perceive the external world in all its\nvariety,--no longer that power of illusion which has given\n\np. lxix\n\nrise to the innumerable phenomena of the external universe. He who has\nattained to this condition has become a Jivanmukta, has been liberated from\nsamsara while still alive in the body.\n\n34\\. The Advaitin holds that the Upanishads and all allied Smritis, Itihasas\nand Puranas teach this doctrine in one harmonious voice. Even the authors of\nother systems of philosophy are most of them not averse to this doctrine,\nthough they do not avowedly uphold it in their writings. First as to the\ninherent nature of Atman: The Saivas and the Sankyas admit that Atman is self-\nexistent and self-conscious. They cannot deny that Atman is essentially\nblissful, as may be seen from the following story related by Vyasa in his\ncommentary on Patanjali\'s Yoga-Sutras:\n\nThere was a great yogin named Jaigishavya. By yoga he attained to all siddhis\nand could read back the history of the universe through many a cycle. In time\nhe turned away his attention from the siddhis, and by Divine wisdom he\nrealised the true nature of the Self and became absorbed in entire devotion to\nit. He was once asked by the teacher what happiness he had derived from the\nsiddhis already-attained. The reply was that no happiness was derived from\nthem. Then the teacher looked surprised that such extremely felicitous siddhis\nhad given him no happiness. The yogin then explained that the felicity\nconferred by the siddhis was no doubt far superior to the worldly happiness,\nbut that it was misery when compared with the Bliss of _Kaivalya_ or Absolute\nFreedom.\n\np. lxx\n\nThe foregoing story shows that Atman is happiness itself: though the Sankhyas\ndo not avowedly say so, simply because the word is in common parlance applied\nto worldly happiness. The Naiyayikas also must admit that Atman is bliss\nitself in so far as they hold that it is even more desirable to attain Atman\nthan to attain the state of Indra and. Brahma. But they avow that in moksha\nAtman is quite as unconscious as a stone, merely because the inherent absolute\nconsciousness of Atman, manifesting itself when freed from all connection with\nthe body and the senses, is quite different from the ordinary objective\nconsciousness, of limited scope and duration obtained by means of the senses.\nIt is for this very reason that the Buddhist Nihilists look upon Atman as a\nnonentity in Nirvana. In his zeal to maintain the universal applicability of\nthe doctrine that everything is momentary, the Vijnanavadin, the Buddhist\nIdealist, is led to conclude that Atman is not a persistent, eternal entity;\nthat He is, on the other hand, a stream of innumerable ever-varying momentary\nideas or states of consciousness. In his view, liberation consists in the\ndestruction of illusory objects by right knowledge and the consequent flow in\na continuous stream of pure ideas which are independent of one another. The\ncontinuity of Atman experienced in liberation is, he says, somewhat like the\ncontinuity of a flame.\n\np. lxxi\n\n[paragraph continues] Though Atman\'s continuity is admitted to be a fact of\nexperience, it is denied by him for the exigencies of a thesis. With a view to\nfirmly establish the doctrine that all external objects are momentary, he\nspends much ingenuity in showing that whatever exists,--including Atman--\nexists only for a moment. In thus denying a fact of experience for the sake of\nan argument, he does not stand alone. The Mimamsakas,--of the school of Bhatta\nfor instance,--in their zeal to demolish the Idealist\'s doctrine that external\nobjects have no existence independent of the ideas of objects, _i.e._ ,\nindependent of the states of consciousness which, as he maintains, are sue\ngeneris,--hold that an idea is not a fact of immediate experience; that it is,\non the other hand, always a matter of inference only. As against the Idealist,\nthey hold that the forms of objects presenting themselves to consciousness\ninhere in the external objects themselves, the existence of corresponding\nideas or mental states being inferred from the existence of forms which are\ndirectly revealed in experience. To the Idealist, as to all others, the\ncontinuity of Atman is a fact of immediate consciousness expressing itself\nthus: \'\'I who now touch the object am the same entity who tasted it before."\nFor the sake of argument, however, he persists in maintaining that Atman also\nis momentary. Again, the Mimamsaka holds that Atman is a doer and\n\np. lxxii\n\nenjoyer in himself, while the Vedantin maintains that Atman can be said to act\nor enjoy only when identified with an upadhi. As the Mimamsaka\'s main object\nis to demolish the materialistic doctrine of the Charvakas, he contents\nhimself with showing that there is an entity independent of the body, who does\nworks here and enjoys their fruits in a world beyond, so that all Vedic\ninjunctions should be duly observed as conducing to the enjoyment of heavenly\nbliss. It does not serve the purposes of a ritualistic doctrine to prove that\nAtman is in himself pure and immutable, himself not a doer of an action nor an\nenjoyer of its effects. On the other hand such a teaching would prove\nprejudicial to the main purpose. The Mimamsakas having expounded their system\nwith the object of supplying a rational basis to the ritualistic doctrine,\nthey cannot be said to be directly averse to the doctrine that Atman in His\nessential nature is pure immutable Consciousness, Existence and Bliss.\n\n35\\. Next as to the unity of Atman and the unreality of all else. No doubt,\nail other schools of philosophy, such as the Sankhyas and the Naiyayikas,\nspeak of the universe of matter and material objects as real, and assert that\nAtmans are infinite in number. They, however, declare that when Spirit is\nliberated, It dwells alone by Itself in Its own light, nothing else presenting\nitself to Its vision. Moreover, the Sankhyas and the Tarkikas\n\np. lxxiii\n\nteach that liberation is attained .by a knowledge of the true nature of\nSpirit, and by discriminating Spirit from matter. If, as the result of this\nknowledge, the whole universe of matter and material objects has altogether\nvanished away from the vision of Spirit, how can it be said to exist at all,\ninasmuch as nothing can be said to exist, of which we are not conscious? Thus\nit follows that the universe has ceased to exist in virtue of the knowledge of\nthe true nature of Spirit. Now, it is only an illusion that can be removed by\nmere knowledge. For example, it is the illusory notion of serpent which is\nremoved when the rope that is mistaken for a serpent is recognised. It must,\ntherefore, be admitted that the universe which is removed by knowledge is also\nan illusion. In the Yoga-Sutras, Patanjali says: \'\'Though removed from the\nvision of the liberated Spirit, it has not vanished altogether, as it is still\nperceived by others" (ii. 22). This can only hold good if the Universe is a\nmere illusion. To one whose eye has some organic defect, the mother-of-pearl\nappears to be silver, while to another it appears not as silver, but as the\nmother-of-pearl. That which appears the same to all is alone true. Wherefore\nthe universe also, which presents itself to consciousness so long only as\nAtman\'s real nature is not known, and no longer, must be an illusion. Though\nconscious of this truth, the\n\np. lxxiv\n\nphilosopher does not expressly state it in order simply that the student\'s\nmind may not get perplexed. If at the very outset the system should start with\na declaration of the unreality of the universe, the mind would be\n[perplexed](errata.htm#10) with the question, how can it be? It is only with a\nview to prevent this perplexity that the universe is spoken of as real. Again,\naccording to the Sankhyas and the Tarkikas, neither the existence of manifold\nAtmans nor a distinction between Jiva and Isvara is ever perceived by the\nliberated soul; and they are, therefore, as unreal as the universe. They admit\nplurality of Atman at the outset with the hope of being better able to explain\nthe varied distribution of pleasure and pain, which in fact is due to variety\nin the upadhis with which the one Atman is associated. Like the Vedantins, the\nSankhyas and others maintain that in liberation Atman alone shines. He is,\ntherefore, in reality one without a second. *\n\n36\\. This short review of the methods and the fundamental tenets of the\nvarious systems of Aryan philosophy and religion is a necessary prelude to the\nshort treatise which, while expounding the main principles of the Vedanta\ndoctrine, also enters into a discussion and refutation of some of\n\np. lxxv\n\nthe conclusions arrived at by other schools. An attempt has been made to show\nfirst wherein chiefly the several schools of philosophy differ and then how\nfinally they all agree. By making allowances for the peculiar standpoints of\nthe several divergent schools, it is possible to construct one harmonious\nsystem of Aryan philosophy and religion containing many a strata of thought\nsuited to the various types of intellect.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lxxiv:*](dast04.htm#fr_0) _Vide_ Madhavacharya\'s commentary on Suta-Samhita,\nYajna-vaibhava-khanda, 8th adhyaya, verse 24.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter I.
