Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus the King, troubled with cares asked his\nsoldiers, in an angry mood. Next he asked his friends in sweet words. The\nprincess, seeing his father and his soldiers sorrowful, thought\n\n\n\np. 602\n\n\n\nof her piercing the two eyes of the Muni with a thorn and thus spoke to the\nKing :-- O Father! While sporting in that forest, I came to see a very hard\nanthill covered with creepers and shrubs wherein I found two holes, O King!\nThrough those small openings, I saw the two shining things as if they were\nfireflies and thinking them so I pierced them with thorns. At this time a\nfaint voice I heard coming from that anthill. \xc2\x93Oh! I am killed!\xc2\x94 I then took\nout my thorns and found them wet with water. \xc2\x93What is this!\xc2\x94 I asked myself\nand was thunderstruck with fear; but I could not know what I pierced in that\nanthill. Hearing these gentle words of her daughter, the King S'aryati thought\nthat that act had no doubt insulted the Muni and went at once to the anthill.\nHe broke the anthill that covered the Muni and saw the suffering Chyavana aged\nin practising Tapasya, very much in pain. The King prostrated flat before the\nMuni and then with folded hands, praised him with hymns and humbly said to him\n:-- \xc2\x93O Intelligent One! My daughter has done this wrong act while sporting;\nTherefore O high-souled One! What she had done unknowingly, do you forgive out\nof your own high-hearted-ness and liberality. I have heard that the ascetics\nare always void of anger; therefore now you have to forgive this daughter of\nthe offence and thus shew your kindness.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n12-16. Vyasa said :-- The Mahar _s_ i Chyavana, hearing thus the King's words\nand specially seeing his humble and distressed nature, said :-- O King! I\nnever was angry a bit; your daughter had pained me; yet I am not angry and\nhave not cast on her any curse; you better see, that I am innocent; much pain\nis felt by me due to my eyes being pricked. O King! It seems that you are\nsorry and troubled for that sin. Who can acquire happiness in this world who\nhas committed a great offence to a Bhakta of the Devi, in spite he gets even\nS'iva as his Protector. O King! On the one hand, I am now worn out by old age,\nand then, on the other hand, I am deprived of my eyes; what shall be now my\nmeans? Please say, who will take care of the blind man?\n\n\n\n17\\. The King said :-- O Muni! The anger of the ascetics is transient; you are\nin practice of your tapasya; so your anger is a thing of impossibility. So\nkindly forgive the offence of the daughter. I have got many persons who will\nincessantly take care of you.\n\n\n\n18-22. Chyavana said :-- \xc2\x93O King! There is none of my relations with me; then\nI am now made blind; how shall I go on with my tapasya? I do not think that\nyour servants will take care of me. O King! If you think it your duty to\nplease me, then do my word,\n\n\n\np. 603\n\n\n\ngive me your lotus-eyed daughter to serve me and take care of me. O King! I\nwill be very glad if I acquire your daughter; she will serve me when I will be\nengaged in my tapasya. O King! This, if observed, will satisfy me and all the\ntroubles that are now with you and your army will no doubt disappear. O King!\nThink and grant me your daughter; I am an ascetic observing vows and if you\ngive over your daughter to me, you will not incur any sin nor any fault.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n23-31. Vyasa said :-- O Bharata! Hearing thus the Muni's words, the King\nS'aryati was immersed in cares and could not say anything whether he would or\nwould not give over his daughter to him. The King thought, \xc2\x93My daughter is\nvery fair like a Devakanya and this Muni is aged, ugly and specially he is\nblind; how then can I be happy if I give over my daughter to him. Who is there\nso stupid and vicious that knowing his good and bad, he for his own selfish\nhappiness wants to deprive his beautiful daughter of the enjoyments of her\nmarried life. How will that fair eyebrowed daughter of mine pass her days\nhappily in the company of this aged Muni when she will be overpowered by\npassion. The more so when the young beautiful ladies are not able to conquer\ntheir passions though possessed of husbands of their own standard and liking,\nhow then can my daughter conquer her passion on getting this old blind\nhusband! The exquisitely beautiful Ahalya married Gautama; but, seeing the\nyouthful beauty of that lovely lady, Indra deceived her and took away her\nchastity. Till at last, her husband Gautama finding that action contrary to\nDharma, cursed him. Now through the severe curse of that Brahma _n_ a many\ntroubles may arise; so I cannot in any case give my daughter Sukanya over to\nhim.\xc2\x94 Thus thinking and absent-minded the King went back to his home and,\nbeing very distressed, called his ministers to form a council. O Ministers!\nWhat am I to do now? Is it advisable to give over my daughter to the Muni? Or\nis it better to suffer these pains? Judge and say what is the best course for\nme.\n\n\n\n32\\. The Ministers said :-- \xc2\x93O King! What shall we say in this critical\njuncture? How can you bestow your exceedingly beautiful daughter to that ugly\nunfortunate ascetic?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n33-45. Dvaipayana said :-- At this moment, seeing her father and ministers\ntroubled very much with cares, Sukanya understood at once everything by signs\nand hints; she then smilingly said to her dear father :-- \xc2\x93O Father! Why are\nyou looking so sad with cares? Perhaps you are very much troubled and sad for\nme. O Father! I have pained that Muni; so I will go and console him; what more\nthan this that I will\n\n\n\np. 604\n\n\n\ngive up myself at his feet and please him.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of Sukanya,\nthe King spoke to her very gladly before all the ministers. O Daughter! The\nChyavana Muni is blind, aged and of a worn figure, especially of a very\nirritable temper; and you are a mere girl; how will you be able to serve him\nin that dreadful forest? You are like Rati in beauty and loveliness; how can I\nbestow my daughter to that aged worn out, blind Muni for my own pleasure! The\nfather marries the daughter to him who has got relations, who is of a proper\nage, strong, who has got unequalled grains and wealth, gems and jewels; never\nto a man void of wealth. O broad-eyed One! You are exquisitely handsome; and\nthat ascetic is very old; see what an amount of difference lies between you\ntwo. The Muni, moreover, has past his marriageable age; so how can I give over\nmy daughter. O Lotus-eyed! You always dwell in beautiful places; how can I now\nmake you dwell for ever in thatched huts? O Cuckoo avoiced one! Rather will I\nand my soldiers die than to bestow you to that blind husband. Let whatever\ncome it may, I will never lose patience; therefore, O One of good hips! Be\nquiet. I will never give you to that blind man. O my Daughter! I don\xc2\x92t care a\nstraw whether my kingdom and my body live or die, but I will never be able to\ngive you over to the ascetic. Hearing thus the father's words, Sukanya began\nto speak with a glad face the following sweet and gentle words :--\n\n\n\n46-48. O Father! Do not trouble yourself for nothing with cares on my account.\nGive me over now to that best of Munis; then all the persons will be happy, no\ndoubt. I will derive my intense pleasure there in that dense forest by serving\nwith intense devotion my old husband, who is very holy. I have got not the\nleast inclination towards these worldly enjoyments which are the sources of\nall troubles for nothing, My heart is now quiet. Therefore, O Father! I will\nbecome a chaste wife to him and act according to his liking.\n\n\n\n49-54. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Ministers were greatly amazed on hearing\nthese words and the King also became greatly pleased and took her to the\npresence of the Muni. Going before him, he bowed down to the Muni and said :--\n\xc2\x93O Lord! Please accept duly this daughter for your Seva.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the\nKing betrothed his daughter to him according to rules. Chyavana Muni also\nbecame very glad to receive her. The Muni took the daughter willingly for his\nSeva but refused other dowries that the King presented. Thus the Muni became\npleased; immediately the soldiers began to evacuate and were very glad. Seeing\nthis, the King's heart became filled with joy. When the King, thus finishing\n\n\n\np. 605\n\n\n\nthe betrothal ceremony of his daughter wanted to return home, the thin bodied\nprincess then told her father :--\n\n\n\n55-64. Sukanya said :-- \xc2\x93O Father! Take away all my ornaments and clothings\nand give me for my use an excellent deer skin and one bark. O Father! I will\ndress myself like the wives of Munis and serve my husband in such a way as\nwill bring to you the unparallelled undying fame in Heaven, Earth and the\nNether regions; also I will serve my husband's feet so that I can derive the\nhighest happiness in the next world. I am now full of youth, especially\nbeautiful; do not think a bit that as I am wedded to an aged ascetic, that my\ncharacter will be spoilt. As Vas'is _th_ a's wife Arundhati has attained\ncelebrity in this world, so I will also attain success; there is no doubt in\nthis. As the chaste wife Anasuya of Mahar _s_ i Artri has become widely known\nin this world so will I be known also and establish your fame.\xc2\x94 The\nexceedingly religious King hearing all these words of Sukanya gave her deer\nskin and all other articles wanted. The King could not help weeping, when he\nsaw that his daughter had dressed herself like the daughter of a Muni. He\nstood fixed, very sad, on that very spot. All the queens were exceedingly\nfilled with sorrow to see the daughter dressed in bark and deer-skin. Their\nhearts quivered and they began to weep. O King! Then the King S'aryati bade\ngood bye to the Muni, leaving there his daughter. He went with a grievous\nheart and returned to his own city, accompanied by the ministers.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Third Chapter of the Seventh Book on the bestowing of the\ndaughter of the King S'aryati to the Chyavana Muni in S'ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 4](bk07ch04.htm)\n\n"
