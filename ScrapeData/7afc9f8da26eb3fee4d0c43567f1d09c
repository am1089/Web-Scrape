Charm against snake-poison.\n\n1\\. As the sun (goes around) the heavens I have surrounded the race of the\nserpents. As night (puts to rest) all animals except the hamsa bird, (thus) do\nI with this (charm) ward off thy poison.  \n2\\. With (the charm) that was found of yore by the Brahmans, found by the\nRishis, and found by the gods, with (the charm) that was, will be, and is now\npresent, with this do I ward off thy poison.  \n3\\. With honey do I mix the rivers; the mountains and peaks are honey. Honey\nare the rivers Parushni and Sipala. Prosperity be to thy mouth, prosperity to\nthy heart!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 56.
