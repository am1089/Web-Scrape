Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! I will now speak of the Dhyanam and the\nmethod of worship of S\xc2\x92ri Devi Manasa, as stated in the Sama Veda. Hear. \xc2\x93I\nmeditate on the Devi Manasa, Whose colour is fair like that of the white\nchampaka flower, whose body is decked all over with jewel ornaments, whose\nclothing is purified by fire, whose sacred thread is the Nagas (serpent), who\nis full of wisdom, who is the foremost of great J\xc3\xb1anins, who is the Presiding\ndeity of the Siddhas, Who Herself is a Siddha and who bestows Siddhis to all.\xc2\x94\nO Muni! Thus meditating on Her, one should present Her, flowers, scents,\nornaments, offerings of food and various other articles, pronouncing the\nprincipal Seed Mantra. O Narada! The twelve lettered Siddha Mantra, to be\nmentioned below, yields to the Bhaktas their desires like the Kalpa Tree. Now\nthe Radical mantra as stated in the Vedas is \xc2\x93Om Hrim S\xc2\x92rim Klim Aim Manasa\nDevyai Svaha.\xc2\x94 Repetition of this, five lakhs of times, yields success to one\nwho repeats. He who attains success in this mantra gets unbounded name and\nfame in this world. Poison becomes nectar to him and he himself becomes famous\nlike Dhanvantari. O Narada! If anybody bathes on any Samkranti day (when the\nsun enters from one sign to another) and going to a private room (hidden\nroom), invokes the Devi\n\n\n\np. 993\n\n\n\nManasa \xc3\x8es\xc2\x92ana and worships Her with devotion, or makes sacrifices of animals\nbefore the Devi on the fifth day of the fortnight, he becomes certainly\nwealthy, endowed with sons and name and fame. Thus I have described to you the\nmethod of worship of Manasa Devi. Now hear the anecdote of the Devi as I heard\nfrom Dharma. In olden days, men became greatly terrified on earth from snakes\nand took refuge of Kas\xc2\x92yapa, the supreme amongst the Munis. The Mahar _s_ i\nKas\xc2\x92yapa became very afraid. He then with Brahma, and by His command composed\na mantra following the principal motto of the Vedas. While composing this\nmantra, he intensely thought of the Devi, the Presiding Deity of that Mantra,\nthrough the power of his Tapasya and through the mental power, the Devi Manasa\nappeared and was named so, as She was produced from the sheer influence of\nmind. On being born, the girl went to the abode of S\xc2\x92ankara in Kailas\xc2\x92a and\nbegan to worship Him and chant hymns to Him with devotion. For one thousand\nDivine years, the daughter of Kas\xc2\x92yapa served Mahadeva when He became pleased.\nHe gave her the Great Knowledge, made Her recite the Sama Veda and bestowed to\nher the eight-lettered Kri _sn_ a mantra which is like the Kalpa Tree. S\xc2\x92rim\nHrim Klim Kri _sn_ aya Namah was the eight lettered Mantra. She got from Him\nthe Kavacha (amulet) auspicious to the three worlds, the method of worship and\nall the rules of Pura _s_ chara _n_ a (repetition of the name of a deity\nattended with burnt offerings, oblations, etc.) and went by His command to\nperform in Pu _s_ kara very hard austerities. There she worshipped Kri _sn_ a\nfor the three Yugas. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a then appeared before Her. On seeing Kri\n_sn_ a, immediately the girl, worn out by austerities, worshipped Him, and she\nwas also worshipped by S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. Kri _sn_ a granted her the boon, \xc2\x93Let\nyou be worshipped throughout the world\xc2\x94 and departed. O Narada! She was thus\nfirst worshipped by the Supreme Spirit, the Devi Kri _sn_ a; secondly by\nS\xc2\x92ankara; thirdly by the Mahar _s_ i Kas\xc2\x92yapa and the Devas. Then she was\nworshipped by the Munis, Manus, Nagas, and men; and She became widely renowned\nin the three worlds. Kas\xc2\x92yapa gave Her over to the hands of Jaratkaru Muni. At\nthe request of the Brahmi _n_ Kas\xc2\x92yapa, the Muni Jarat Karu married Her. After\nthe marriage, one day, being tired with his long work of Tapasya, Jarat Karu\nlaid his head on the hip and loins of his married wife and fell fast asleep.\nGradually the evening came in. The sun set. Then Manasa thought, \xc2\x93If my\nhusband fails to perform the Sandhya, the daily duty of the Brahma _n_ as, he\nwould be involved in the sin of Brahmahatya. It is definitely stated in the\nS\xc2\x92astras, that if any Brahma _n_ a does not perform his Sandhya in the morning\nand in the evening, he becomes wholly impure and the sins\n\n\n\np. 994\n\n\n\nBrahmahattya and other crimes come down on his head.\xc2\x94 Arguing thus, these\nthoughts in her mind, as commanded by the Vedas, at last she awakened her\nhusband, who then got up from his sleep.\n\n\n\n31-60. The Muni Jarat Karu said :-- \xc2\x93O Chaste One! I was sleeping happily. Why\nhave you thus interrupted my sleep? All his vows turn out useless who injures\nher husband. Her tapas, fastings, gifts, and other meritorious works all come\nto vain who do things unpleasant to her husband. If she worships her husband,\nshe is said to have worshipped S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. For the sake of fulfilling the\nvows of the chaste women, Hari himself becomes their husbands. All sorts of\ncharities, gifts, all sacrifices, fastings, practising all the virtues,\nkeeping to truth, worshipping all the Devas, nothing can turn out equal to\neven one-sixteenth part of serving one\xc2\x92s husband. She ultimately goes with her\nhusband to the region of Vaiku _nt_ ha, who serves her husband in this holy\nland Bharata. She comes certainly of a bad family who does unpleasant acts to\nher husband or who uses unpleasant words to her husband. She goes to the\nKumbhipaka hell as long as the Sun and Moon last and then she becomes born as\na Cha _nd_ ali, without husband and son.\xc2\x94 Speaking thus, Jarat Karu, the best\nof the Munis, became angry and his lips began to tremble. Seeing this, the\nbest Manasa, shivering with fear, addressed her husband :--\n\n\n\nI have broken your sleep and awakened you, fearing you might miss your time of\nSandhya. I have committed an offence. Punish me as you think. I know that a\nman goes to the Kalasutra hell as long as the Sun and Moon last in this world,\nwho throws an obstacle when any man eats, sleeps or enjoys with the opposite\nsex. O Narada! Thus saying, the Devi Manasa fell down at the feet of her\nhusband and cried again and again. On the other hand, knowing the Muni angry,\nand ready to curse her, the Sun came there with Sandhya Devi. And He humbly\nspoke to him with fear :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! Seeing Me going to set, and fearing\nthat you may miss Dharma, your chaste wife has awakened you. O Brahmi _n_! Now\nI am also under your refuge; forgive me. O Bhagavan! You should not curse Me.\nThe more so, a Brahma _n_ a\xc2\x92s heart is as tender as the fresh butter. The\nanger of a Brahma _n_ lasts only half the twinkling of an eye (K _s_ a _n_ ).\nWhen a Brahma _n_ a becomes angry, he can burn all this world and can make a\nnew creation. So who can possess an influence like a Brahma _n_ a. A Brahmi\n_n_ is a part of Brahma; he is shining day and night with the Tejas of Brahma.\nA Brahma _n_ a meditates always on the Eternal Light of Brahma.\xc2\x94 O Narada!\nHearing the words of the Sun, the Brahmi _n_ became satisfied and blessed Him.\nThe Sun also went to His own place, thus blessed daily. To keep his promise,\nthe Brahmin Jaratkaru quitted\n\n\n\np. 995\n\n\n\nManasa. She became very sorry and began to cry aloud with pain and anguish.\nBeing very much distressed by the then danger, she remembered Her \xc3\x8e _st_ a\nDeva, Mahadeva, Brahma, Hari and Her father Mahar _s_ i Kas\xc2\x92yapa. On the very\ninstant when Manasa remembered S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Lord of the Gopis,\nMahadeva, Brahma and Mahar _s_ i Kas\xc2\x92yapa appeared there. Then seeing his own\ndesired Deity S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, superior to Prakriti, beyond the attributes,\nJaratkaru began to praise Him and bowed down to Him repeatedly. Then bowing\ndown to Mahadeva, Brahma and Kas\xc2\x92yapa, he enquired why they had come there.\nBrahma, then, instantly bowed down at the lotus feet of Hri _s_ ikes\xc2\x92a and\nspoke in befitting words at that time if the Brahmi _n_ Jaratkaru leaves at\nall his legal wife, devoted to her own Dharma, he should first of all have a\nson born of her to fulfil his Dharma. O Muni! Any man can quit his wife, after\nhe has impregnated her and got a son. But if without having a son, he leaves\nhis wife, then all his merits are lost as all water leaks out of a sieve or a\nstrainer. O Narada! Hearing thus the words of Brahma, the Muni Jaratkaru by\nhis Yogic power recited a Mantra and touching the navel of Manasa spoke to her\n:-- \xc2\x93O Manasa! A son will be born in your womb self-controlled, religious, and\nbest of the Brahma _n_ as.\n\n\n\n61-77. That son will be fiery, energetic, renowned, well-qualified the\nforemost of the Knowers of the Vedas, a great J\xc3\xb1anin and the best of the\nYogis. That son is a true son, indeed, who uplifts his family who is religious\nand devoted to Hari. At his birth all the Pitris dance with great joy. And the\nwife is a true wife who is devoted to her husband, good-natured and sweet-\nspeaking and she is religious, she is the mother of sons, she is the woman of\nthe family and she is the preserver of the family. He is the true friend,\nindeed, the giver of one\xc2\x92s desired fruits, who imparts devotion to Hari. That\nfather is a true father who shows the way to devotion to Hari. And She is the\nTrue Mother, through whom this entering into wombs ceases for ever, yea, for\never! That sister is the true kind sister from whom the fear of Death\nvanishes. That Guru is the Guru who gives the Vi _sn_ u Mantra and the true\ndevotion to Vi _sn_ u. That Guru is the real bestower of knowledge who gives\nthe J\xc3\xb1anam by which S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a is meditated in whom this whole universe,\nmoving and non-moving from the Brahma down to a blade of grass, is appearing\nand disappearing. There is no doubt in this. What knowledge can be superior to\nthat of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. The knowledge derived from the Vedas, or from the\nsacrifices or from any other source is not superior to the service to S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a. The devotion and knowledge of S\xc2\x92ri Hari is the Essence of all\nknowledge; all else is vain and mockery. It is through this Real Knowledge;\nthat this bondage from this world is severed. But the Guru who does not impart\nthis devotion\n\n\n\np. 996\n\n\n\nand knowledge of S\xc2\x92ri Hari is not the real Guru; rather he is an enemy that\nleads one to bondage. Verily he kills his disciple when he does not free him.\nHe can never be called a Guru, father or friend who does not free his disciple\nfrom the pains in the various wombs and from the pains of death. Verily he can\nnever be called a friend who does not show the way to the Undecaying S\xc2\x92ri Kri\n_sn_ a, the Source of the Highest Bliss. So, O Chaste One! You better worship\nthat Undecaying Para Brahma S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, Who is beyond the attributes. O\nBeloved! I have left you out of a pretence; please excuse me for this. The\nchaste women are always forgiving; never they become angry because they are\nborn of Sattvagu _n_ as. Now I go to Pu _s_ kara for Tapasya; you better go\nwherever you like. Those who have no desire have their minds always attached\nto the lotus feet of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Hearing the words of\nJaratkaru, the Devi Manasa became very much distressed and bewildered with\ngreat sorrow. Tears began to flow from her eyes. She then humbly spoke to her\ndearest husband :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! I have not committed any such offence, as you\nleave me altogether when I have thus broken your sleep.\n\n\n\n78-115. However kindly show Thyself to me when I will recollect you. The\nbereavement of one\xc2\x92s friend is painful; more than that is the bereavement of a\nson. Again one\xc2\x92s husband is dearer than one hundred sons; so the bereavement\nof one\xc2\x92s husband is the heaviest of all. To women, the husband is the most\nbeloved of all earthly things; hence he is called Priya, i.e., dear. As the\nheart of one who has only one son is attached to that son, as the heart of a\nVai _sn_ ava is attached to S\xc2\x92ri Hari; as the mind of one-eyed man to his one\neye, as the mind of the thirsty is attached to water, as the mind of the\nhungry is attached to food, as the mind of the passionate is attached to lust,\nas the mind of a thief is attached to the properties of others, as the mind of\na lewd man to his prostitute, as the mind of the learned is attached to the\nS\xc2\x92astras, as the mind of a trader is attached to his trade, so the minds of\nchaste women are attached to their husbands.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, Manasa fell down at\nthe feet of her husband. Jaratkaru, the ocean of mercy, then, took her for a\nmoment on his lap and drenched her body with tears from his eyes. The Devi\nManasa, too, distressed at the bereavement of her husband also drenched the\nlap of the Muni with tears from her eyes. Some time after, the true knowledge\narose in them and they both became free from fear. Jaratkaru then enlightened\nhis wife and asked her to meditate on the lotus feet of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a the\nSupreme Spirit repeatedly; thus saying he went away for his Tapasya. Manasa,\ndistressed with sorrow, went to his \xc3\x8e _st_ a Deva Mahadeva on Kailas\xc2\x92a. The\nauspicious S\xc2\x92iva and Parvati both consoled her with knowledge and advice. Some\ndays after, on an\n\n\n\np. 997\n\n\n\nauspicious they and on an auspicious moment she gave birth to a son born in\npart of Naraya _n_ a, and as the Guru of the Yogis and as the Preceptor of the\nJ\xc3\xb1anins. When the child was in mother\xc2\x92s womb, he heard the highest knowledge\nfrom the mouth of Mahadeva; therefore he was born as a Yogindra and the\nSpiritual Teacher of the J\xc3\xb1anins. On his birth, Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ankara performed\nhis natal ceremonies and performed various auspicious ceremonies. The Brahma\n_n_ as chanted the Vedas for the welfare of the child; various wealth and\njewels and Kiri _t_ as and invaluable gems were distributed by S\xc2\x92ankara to the\nBrahma _n_ as; and Parvati gave one lakh cows and various jewels to others.\nAfter some days, Mahadeva taught him the four Vedas with their Angas (six\nlimbs) and gave him, at last, the Mrityumjaya Mantra. As in Manasa\xc2\x92s mind\nthere reigned the devotion to her husband, the devotion to her \xc3\x8e _st_ a Deva\nand Guru, the child\xc2\x92s name was kept \xc3\x82stika.\n\n\n\n\xc3\x82stika then got the Maha Mantra from S\xc2\x92ankara and by his command went to Pu\n_s_ kara to worship Vi _sn_ u, the Supreme Spirit. There he practised tapasya\nfor three lakh divine years. And then he returned to Kailas\xc2\x92a, to bow down to\nthe great Yogi and the Lord S\xc2\x92ankara, Then, bowing down to S\xc2\x92ankara, he\nremained there for some time when Manasa with her son \xc3\x82stika went to the\nhermitage of Kas\xc2\x92yapa, her father. Seeing Manasa with son, the Mahar _s_ i\xc2\x92s\ngladness knew no bounds. He fed innumerable Brahma _n_ as for the welfare of\nthe child, and distributed lakhs and lakhs of jewels. The joy of Aditi and\nDiti (the wives of Kas\xc2\x92yapa) knew no bounds; Manasa remained there for a long,\nlong time with his son. O Child! Hear now an anecdote on this. One day due to\na bad Karma, a Brahma _n_ a cursed the king Parik _s_ it, the son of\nAbhimanyu; one Ri _s_ i\xc2\x92s son named S\xc2\x92ringi, sipping the water of the river\nKaus\xc2\x92iki cursed thus :-- \xc2\x93When a week expires, the snake Tak _s_ aka will bite\nyou, and you will be burnt with the poison of that snake Tak _s_ aka.\xc2\x94 Hearing\nthis, the King Parik _s_ it, to preserve his life, went to a place, solitary\nwhere wind even can have no access and he lived there. When the week was over,\nDhanvantari saw, while he was going on the road, the snake Tak _s_ aka who was\nalso going to bite the king. A conversation and a great friendship arose\nbetween them; Tak _s_ aka gave him voluntarily a gem; and Dhanvantari, getting\nit, became pleased and went back gladly to his house. The king Parik _s_ it\nwas lying on his bed-stead when Tak _s_ aka bit the king. The king died soon\nand went to the next world. The king Janamejaya then performed the funeral\nobsequies of his father and commenced afterwards the Sarpa Yaj\xc3\xb1a (a sacrifice\nwhere the snakes are the victims). In that sacrifice, innumerable snakes gave\nup their lives by the Brahma Teja (the fire of the Brahmi _n_ s). At this, Tak\n_s_ aka became\n\n\n\np. 998\n\n\n\nterrified and took refuge of Indra. The Brahmi _n_ s, then, in a body, became,\nready to burn Tak _s_ aka along with Indra, when, Indra and the other Devas\nwent to Manasa. Mahendra, bewildered with fear, began to chant hymns to\nManasa. Manasa called his own son \xc3\x82stika who then went to the sacrificial\nassembly of the king Janamejaya and begged that the lives of Indra and Tak _s_\naka be spared. The king, then, at the command of the Brahma _n_ as, granted\ntheir lives. The king, then, completed his sacrifice and gladly gave the Dak\n_s_ i _n_ as to the Brahmi _n_ s. The Brahma _n_ as, Munis, and Devas\ncollected and went to Manasa and worshipped Her separately and chanted hymns\nto Her. Indra went there with the various articles and He worshipped Manasa\nwith devotion and with great love and care; and He chanted hymns to Her. Then\nbowing down before Her, and under the instructions of Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and\nMahes\xc2\x92a, offered her sixteen articles, sacrifices and various other good and\npleasant things. O Narada! Thus worshipping Her, they all went to their\nrespective places. Thus I have told you the anecdote of Manasa. What more do\nyou want to hear. Say.\n\n\n\nNarada said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! How did Indra praise Her and what was the method of\nHis worshipping Her; I want to hear all this.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n116-124. Naraya _n_ a said :-- Indra first took his bath; and, performing\n\xc3\x82chamana and becoming pure, He put on a fresh and clean clothing and placed\nManasa Devi on a jewel throne. Then reciting the Vedic mantras he made Her\nperform Her bath by the water of the Mandakini, the celestial river Ganges,\npoured from a jewel jar and then He made Her put on the beautiful clothing,\nuninflammable by fire. Then He caused sandalpaste to be applied to Her body\nall over with devotion and offered water for washing Her feet and Arghya, an\noffering of grass and flowers and rice, etc., as a token of preliminary\nworship. First of all the six Devatas Ganes\xc2\x92a, Sun, Fire, Vi _sn_ u, S\xc2\x92iva,\nand S\xc2\x92iva were worshipped. Then with the ten lettered mantra, \xc2\x93Om Hrim S\xc2\x92rim\nManasa Devyai Svaha\xc2\x94 offered all the offerings to Her. Stimulated by the God\nVi _sn_ u, Indra worshipped with great joy the Devi with sixteen articles so\nvery rare to any other person. Drums and instruments were sounded. From the\ncelestial heavens, a shower of flowers was thrown on the head of Manasa. Then,\nat the advice of Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and Mahes\xc2\x92a, the Devas and the Brahma _n_\nas, Indra, with tears in his eyes, began to chant hymns to Manasa, when his\nwhole body was thrilled with joy and hairs stood on their ends.\n\n\n\n125-145. Indra said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi Manase! Thou standest the highest amongst the\nchaste women. Therefore I want to chant hymns to\n\n\n\np. 999\n\n\n\nThee. Thou art higher than the highest. Thou art most supreme. What I now\npraise Thee? Chanting hymns is characterised by the description of one\xc2\x92s\nnature; so it is said in the Vedas. But, O Prakriti! I am unable to ascertain\nand describe Thy qualities. Thou art of the nature of S\xc2\x92uddha Sattva (higher\nthan the pure sattva unmixed with any other Gu _n_ as); Thou art free from\nanger and malice. The Muni Jaratkaru could not forsake Thee; therefore it was\nthat he prayed for Thy separation before. O Chaste One! I have now worshipped\nThee. Thou art an object of worship as my mother Aditi is. Thou art my sister\nfull of mercy; Thou art the mother full of forgiveness. O Sures\xc2\x92vari! It is\nthrough Thee that my wife, sons and my life are saved. I am worshipping Thee.\nLet Thy love be increased. O World-Mother! Thou art eternal; though Thy\nworship is extant everywhere in the universe; yet I worship Thee to have it\nextended further and further. O Mother! Those who worship Thee with devotion\non the Sankranti day of the month of \xc3\x82 _s_ u _d_ ha, or on the Naga Pa\xc3\xb1chami\nday, or on the Sankranti day of every month or on every day, they get their\nsons and grandsons, wealth and grains increased and become themselves famous,\nwell gratified, learned and renowned. If anybody does not worship Thee out of\nignorance, rather if he censures Thee, he will be bereft of Lak _s_ mi and he\nwill be always afraid of snakes. Thou art the Griha Lak _s_ mi of all the\nhouseholders and the Raja Lak _s_ mi of Vaiku _nt_ ha. Bhagavan Jarat Karu,\nthe great Muni, born in part of Naraya _n_ a, is Thy husband. Father Kas\xc2\x92yapa\nhas created Thee mentally by his power of Tapas and fire to preserve us; Thou\nart his mental creation; hence thy name is Manasa. Thou Thyself hast become\nSiddha Yogini in this world by thy mental power; hence thou art widely known\nas Manasa Devi in this world and worshipped by all. The Devas always worship\nThee mentally with devotion; hence the Pundits call Thee by the name of\nManasa. O Devi! Thou always servest Truth, hence Thou art of the nature of\nTruth. He certainly gets Thee who always thinks of Thee verily as of the\nnature of truth.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Thus praising his sister Manasa and receiving from\nher the desired boon, Indra went back, dressed in his own proper dress, to his\nown abode. The Devi Manasa, then, honored and worshipped everywhere, and thus\nworshipped by her brother, long lived in Her father\xc2\x92s house, with Her son.\n\n\n\nOne day Surabhi (the heavenly cow) came from the Goloka and bathed Manasa with\nmilk and worshipped Her with great devotion and revealed to Her all the Tattva\nJ\xc3\xb1anas, to be kept very secret. (This is now made the current story wherever\nany Lingam suddenly becomes visible.) O Narada! Thus worshipped by the Devas\nand Surabhi, the Devi Manasa went to the Heavenly regions. O Muni! One gets no\nfear from snakes who recites\n\n\n\np. 1000\n\n\n\nthis holy Stotra composed by Indra and worships Manasa; his family descendants\nare freed from the fear due to snakes. If anybody becomes Siddha in this\nStotra, poison becomes nectar to him. Reciting the stotra five lakhs of times\nmakes a man Siddha in this Stotra. So much so that he can sleep on a bed of\nsnakes and he can ride on snakes.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Forty-eighth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the anecdote of Manasa\nin the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_\ni Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 49](bk09ch49.htm)\n\n'
