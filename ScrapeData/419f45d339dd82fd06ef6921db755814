He lays down the Nakasads (firmament-seated bricks): the firmament-\nseated ones, assuredly, are the gods. In this (layer) that whole fire-altar\nbecomes completed, and therein these (bricks are) the firmament (naka), the\nworld of heaven: it is therein that the gods seated themselves; and inasmuch\nas the gods seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven, the\ngods are the firmament-seated. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he\nlays down these (bricks), now seat himself on that firmament, in the world of\nheaven.\n\n8:6:1:22\\. And, again, why he lays down the Nakasads. Now at that time the\ngods saw that firmament, the world of heaven, these Stomabhagas 1. They spake,\n\np. 98\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Think ye upon this, how we may seat ourselves on that\nfirmament, in the world of heaven!' They spake,\n\np. 99\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Meditate ye! seek ye a layer!' whereby, indeed, they\nsaid, 'Seek ye this, how we may seat ourselves on this firmament, in the world\nof heaven!'\n\n8:6:1:33\\. Whilst meditating, they saw these bricks, the Nakasads, and placed\nthem on (the altar): by means of them they seated themselves on that\nfirmament, in the world of heaven; and inasmuch as through them they seated\nthemselves (sad) on that firmament (naka), in the world of heaven, these are\nthe Naka-sad (bricks); and in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he lays\ndown these (bricks), now seat himself on that firmament, in the world of\nheaven.\n\np. 100\n\n8:6:1:44\\. He places them in the (four) quarters; for that firmament, the\nworld of heaven, is the quarters: he thus establishes them in the world of\nheaven. On the range of the _Ri_ tavyas (he places them); for the _Ri_ tavyas\n(seasonal bricks) are the year, and the world of heaven is the year: it is in\nthe world of heaven he thus establishes them. Within the Stomabhagas (he\nplaces them); for this is the firmament, the world of heaven: it is therein he\nthus establishes them.\n\n8:6:1:55\\. In front he lays down one, with (Va _g_. S. XV, 10), 'Queen thou\nart, the Eastern region,' for a queen indeed the eastern region is;--'The\ndivine Vasus are thine overlords 1,' for the divine Vasus are indeed the\noverlords of that region;--'Agni is the repeller of shafts,' for Agni, indeed,\nis here the repeller of shafts;--'The Triv _ri_ t-Stoma may uphold thee on\nearth!' for by the threefold hymn(-form) this one is indeed upheld on\nearth;--'The \xc3\x82 _g_ ya- _s_ astra may support thee for steadiness' sake 2!' for\nby the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya- _s_ astra it is indeed supported on earth for steadiness'\nsake;--'the Rathantara-saman for stability in the air!' for by the Rathantara-\nsaman it is indeed established in the air;--'May the _Ri_ shis, the first-\nborn, magnify 3 thee among the gods!'--the _Ri_ shis, the first-born,\ndoubtless, are the vital airs 4, for they are the first-born Brahman 5;--'with\nthe measure, the width of the sky!'--that is, 'as great as the sky is, so much\nin width may they broaden thee!'--\n\np. 101\n\n[paragraph continues] 'And he, the upholder, and the overlord,'--these two are\nspeech and mind, for these two uphold everything here;--'may they all, of one\nmind, settle thee, and the Sacrificer, on the back of the firmament, in the\nworld of heaven!' as the text, so its import.\n\n8:6:1:66\\. Then on the right (south) side (he lays down one 1), with (Va _g_.\nS. XV, 11), 'Wide-ruling thou art, the southern region,' for wide-ruling\nindeed is that southern region;--'The divine Rudras are thine overlords,' for\nthe divine Rudras are indeed the overlords of that region;--'Indra is the\nrepeller of shafts,' for Indra, indeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The\nPa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a-stoma may uphold thee on earth!' for by the fifteenfold\nhymn it is indeed upheld on earth;--'The Prauga- _s_ astra may support thee\nfor steadiness' sake!' for by the Prauga- _s_ astra it is indeed supported on\nearth for steadiness' sake;--'the B _ri_ hat-saman for stability in the air!'\nfor by the B _ri_ hat-saman it is indeed established in the air;--'May the\n_Ri_ shis, the first-born, magnify thee among gods . . .!' the import of this\n(and the rest) has been explained.\n\n8:6:1:77\\. Then behind (he lays down one), with (Va _g_. S. XV, 12), 'All-\nruling thou art, the western region,' for all-ruling indeed is that western\nregion;--'The divine \xc3\x82dityas are thine overlords,' for the divine \xc3\x82dityas are\nindeed the overlords of that region;--'Varu _n_ a is the repeller of shafts,'\nfor Varu _n_ a, indeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The Saptada _s_\na-stoma may uphold thee on\n\np. 102\n\nearth!' for by the seventeenfold hymn it is indeed upheld on earth;--'The\nMarutvatiya- _s_ astra may support thee for steadiness' sake!' for by the\nMarutvatiya- _s_ astra it is indeed supported on earth for steadiness'\nsake;--'the Vairupa-saman for stability in the air!' for by the Vairupa-saman\nit is indeed established in the air;--'May the _Ri_ shis, the first-born,\nmagnify thee among the gods . . .!' the import of this has been explained.\n\n8:6:1:88\\. Then on the left (north) side (he lays down one), with (Va _g_. S.\nXV, 13), 'Self-ruling thou art, the northern region,' for self-ruling that\nnorthern region indeed is; 'The divine Maruts are thine overlords,' for the\ndivine Maruts are indeed the overlords of that region;--'Soma is the repeller\nof shafts,' for Soma, indeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The Ekavi _m_\n_s_ a-stoma may uphold thee on earth!' for by the twenty-one-fold hymn this\none is indeed upheld on earth;--'The Nishkevalya- _s_ astra may support thee\nfor steadiness' sake!' for by the Nishkevalya- _s_ astra it is indeed\nsupported on earth for steadiness' sake;--'the Vaira _g_ a-saman for stability\nin the air!' for by the Vaira _g_ a-saman it is indeed established in the\nair;--'May the _Ri_ shis, the first-born, magnify thee among the gods . . .!'\nthe import of this has been explained.\n\n8:6:1:99\\. Then in the middle (he lays down one 1), with (Va _g_. S. XV, 14),\n'The sovereign mistress thou art, the Great region!' for the sovereign\nmistress that great region indeed is;--'the All-gods are\n\np. 103\n\nthine overlords,' for the All-gods are indeed the overlords of that\nregion;--'B _ri_ haspati is the repeller of shafts,' for B _ri_ haspati,\nindeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The Tri _n_ ava- and Trayastri _m_\n_s_ a-stomas may uphold thee on earth;'--for by the twenty-nine-fold and\nthirty-three-fold hymns this one is indeed upheld on earth;--'The Vai _s_\nvadeva- and \xc3\x82gnimaruta- _s_ astras may support thee for steadiness' sake!' for\nby the Vai _s_ vadeva- and \xc3\x82gnimaruta- _s_ astras it is indeed supported on\nearth for steadiness' sake;--'May the _Ri_ shis, the first-born, magnify thee\namong the gods . . .!' the import of this has been explained.\n\n8:6:1:1010\\. Thus much, indeed, is the whole sacrifice, and the sacrifice is\nthe self of the gods: it was after making the sacrifice their own self that\nthe gods seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven; and in\nlike manner does the Sacrificer now, after making the sacrifice his own self,\nseat himself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.\n\n8:6:1:1111\\. He then lays down the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ a ('five-knobbed')\nbricks; for the Nakasads are (parts of) the sacrifice, and so indeed are the\nPa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ as the sacrifice: the Nakasads are these four\nsacrificial priests together with the Sacrificer as the fifth; and the Pa _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ a _k_ u _d_ as are the Hotras 1. Now the Hotras are additional (to the\nofficiating staff, or to the Hot _ri_ ) and whatever is additional is an\nexcrescence ( _k_ u _d_ a); and hence, as they are five additional (bricks),\nthey are (called) Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ as 2.\n\np. 104\n\n8:6:1:1212\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Nakasad-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u\n_d_ as;--it is for the sake of completeness; for the Nakasads are the self,\nand the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ as the mate, and this, the mate, doubtless, is\none half of the self; for when one is with his mate 1, then he is whole and\ncomplete.\n\n8:6:1:1313\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Nakasad-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u\n_d_ as;--the Nakasads are the self, and the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ as are\noffspring (or subjects) 2. Now progeny is something additional to the self,\nand whatever is additional is an excrescence; and hence, as they are five\nadditional ones, they are (called) Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ as.\n\n8:6:1:1414\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Nakasad-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u\n_d_ as;--the Nakasads are the regions, and the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ as, too,\nare the regions: what five regions there are on this side of yonder sun, they\nare the Nakasads, and those which are on the other side are the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a\n_k_ u _d_ as. Now those regions which are on the other side of yonder sun are\nadditional, and what is additional is an excrescence ( _k_ u _d_ a): and\nhence, as they are five additional ones, they are called Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u\n_d_ as.\n\n8:6:1:1515\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ as.\nNow, at that time the gods were afraid lest the fiends, the Rakshas, should\ndestroy\n\np. 105\n\nthese worlds of theirs from above. They put those protectors over these\nworlds, to wit, those shafts and missiles; and in like manner does the\nSacrificer now put those protectors over these worlds, to wit, those shafts\nand missiles.\n\n8:6:1:1616\\. He places one in front, with (Va _g_. S. XV, 15), 'This one in\nfront, the yellow-haired one,'--Agni, no doubt, is in front; and as 'to his\nsaying of him as (being) 'in front,' it is because they take him out (of the\nGarhapatya hearth) towards the front 1, and attend upon him towards the front;\nand as to why he calls him yellow-haired, it is because Agni is, as it were,\nyellow;--'the sun-rayed one,' for Agni's rays are like those of the sun;--'and\nRathag _ri_ tsa and Rathau _g_ as 2, his commander and his chieftain,' the two\nspring-months are these two;--'and the nymphs Pu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ikasthala and\nKratusthala 3,'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said Mahitthi; but army\nand battle these two are;--'mordacious beasts the shaft, manslaughter the\nmissile,'--inasmuch as they fight in army and battle, those mordacious beasts\nare the shaft; 'manslaughter the missile,'--inasmuch as they slay one another,\nmanslaughter is the missile;--'to them be homage!' it is to them he pays\nhomage;--'be they gracious unto us!' they are indeed gracious to him;--'he\nwhom we hate, and he who hates us,\n\np. 106\n\nhim we put into their jaws!' whomsoever he hates, and whoever hates him, him\nhe puts into their jaws. 'N. N. I put into their jaws,' thus he may name him\nwhom he hates, and thereafter he will not be there any more. Let him disregard\nthis also, for indeed marked out of himself is he whom he who knows this\nhates.\n\n8:6:1:1717\\. Then on the right (south) side (he places one), with (Va _g_. S.\nXV, 16), 'This one on the right, the all-worker,' the all-worker is this Vayu\n(the wind) who blows here, for he makes everything here; and because he speaks\nof him as (being) 'on the right,' therefore it is in the south that he blows\nmost;--'and Rathasvana (chariot-noise) and Rathe _k_ itra (glorious on the\nchariot), his commander and chieftain;' these are the two summer-months;--'and\nthe two nymphs, Menaka and Saha _g_ anya,'--'quarter and intermediate\nquarter,' said Mahitthi; but these two are heaven and earth;--'Goblins the\nshaft, demons the missile;' for goblins indeed are here the shaft (weapon),\nand demons the missile;--'to them be homage . . .!' the import of this has\nbeen explained.\n\n8:6:1:1818\\. Then behind (in the west, he lays down a brick), with (Va _g_. S.\nXV, 17), 'This one behind, the all-embracer,'--the all-embracer, doubtless, is\nyonder sun; for as soon as he rises all this embracing space comes into\nexistence; and because he speaks of him as (being) 'behind,' therefore one\nsees him only when he goes towards the back (west);--'and Rathaprota (fixed on\nthe chariot) and Asamaratha (of matchless chariot), his commander and\nchieftain;' these are the two rainy months;--'and the nymphs Pramlo _k_ anti\n(the setting one) and\n\np. 107\n\n[paragraph continues] Anumlo _k_ anti (the rising one),'--'quarter and\nintermediate quarter,' said Mahitthi, but they are day and night, for these\ntwo set and rise; 'tigers the shaft, snakes the missile,' for indeed tigers\nare here the shaft, and snakes the missile;--'to them be homage . . .!' the\nimport of this has been explained.\n\n8:6:1:1919\\. Then on the left (north) side (he places one), with (Va _g_. S.\nXV, 17), 'This one on the left, of ever flowing blessings;' on the left is the\nsacrifice; and as to why he speaks of it as 'on the left,' it is because the\nsacrifice is performed from the left (north) side; and as to why he speaks of\nit as 'of ever-flowing blessings (sa _m_ yadvasu),' they do indeed flow\ntogether (sa _m_ yanti) to the sacrifice, thinking, 'this is a\nblessing;'--'and Tarkshya and Arish _t_ anemi, his commander and chieftain,'\nthese are the two autumn-months; 'and the nymphs Vi _s_ va _k_ i (the all-\ninclined) and Gh _ri_ ta _k_ i (the ghee-inclined),'--'quarter and\nintermediate quarter,' said Mahitthi, but they are the vedi (altar) and the\noffering-spoon, for the altar is all-inclined 1, and the offering-spoon is\nghee-inclined;--'water the shaft, wind the missile,'--water indeed is here the\nshaft, and wind the missile, for from this side it blows hot, and from that\nside cold;--'to them be homage . . .!' the import of this has been explained.\n\n8:6:1:2020\\. Then in the middle (he lays down one), with (Va _g_. S. XV, 19),\n'This one above, the boon-bestower 2,' the one above, doubtless, is Par _g_\nanya (the rain-god); and when he speaks of him as (being)\n\np. 108\n\n[paragraph continues] 'above,' it is because Par _g_ anya is indeed above; and\nwhen he calls him the boon-bestower, it is because from there the boon, rain,\nfood for creatures, is bestowed hitherwards;--'and Sena _g_ it (the conqueror\nof armies) and Sushena (leader of a fine army), his commander and chieftain,'\nthese are the two winter-months;--'and the nymphs, Urva _s_ i and Purva _s_\n_k_ itti,'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said Mahitthi, but they are\noblation and dakshi _n_ a (priest's sacrificial fee);--'thunder the shaft,\nlightning the missile,' for indeed thunder is here the shaft, and lightning\nthe missile;--'to them be homage . . .!' the import of this has been\nexplained.\n\n8:6:1:2121\\. These, then, are the shafts and missiles which the gods then put\nas protectors over these worlds, and as to offspring (or subjects 1), they are\nthe commander and chieftain; and as to the mates, they are those nymphs,--\nhaving thus become complete with offspring and with mates, the gods seated\nthemselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven; and in like manner does\nthe Sacrificer, having become complete with offspring and a mate, now seat\nhimself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.\n\n8:6:1:2222\\. Now, these are ten (Nakasad-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ a) bricks he\nlays down;--of ten, syllables the Vira _g_ consists, and this layer is vira\n_g_ (far-shining). There are, however, only five of them, for he lays them\ndown by two and two. And, verily, they are prayers for prosperity to Agni (the\nfire-altar). He places them in the last layer, for this, the last, layer is\nthe end of Agni: it is thus at the end that he\n\np. 109\n\npronounces the prayers for prosperity to Agni. There are five of them, for at\nthe sacrifice there are five prayers for prosperity 1. Between (each) two he\nthrows loose soil, for these two bricks being fires, he does so fearing lest\nthese two fires should blaze up together. And, moreover, loose soil means\nfood: it is thus by means of food that he brings about concord between them.\n\n8:6:1:2323\\. Now; then, as to the order of proceeding. Having laid down (a\nbrick) in front, he lays down those on the right, behind, on the left, and in\nthe middle. Then the upper ones: having first laid down one in front, he lays\ndown those on the right, on the left, in the middle, and behind. And, indeed,\nthe world of heaven is entered from below, for the gods, having at that time,\nclosed up these worlds on all sides, entered the world of heaven from below;\nand in like manner does the Sacrificer now, having closed up these worlds on\nall sides, enter the world of heaven from below.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[97:1](sbe4323.htm#fr_181) The central portion of the fifth layer is here\ncharacterised as symbolically representing the firmament, the blue canopy of\nheaven, and the region of bliss beyond it. The outer rim of this central\nstructure is formed by a continuous ring of twenty-nine Stomabhaga (st) bricks\nrepresenting, it would seem, the horizon on which the vault of heaven rests.\nThere is some doubt as to the exact manner in which this ring of bricks is to\nbe arranged. According to Katy. _S_ rautas. XVII, 11, 10, fifteen bricks are\nto he placed south (and fourteen north) of the anuka, or spine (running\nthrough the p. 98 centre from west to east). As regards the southern\nsemicircle, the fifteen bricks are to be distributed in such a way that eight\nfall within the south-easterly, and seven into the south-westerly, quadrant.\nSome such arrangement as that adopted in the diagram below would seem to be\nwhat is intended. It will be seen that this arrangement includes two half-size\nbricks in the south-easterly\n\n![THE CENTRAL PART OF THE FIFTH LAYER.](img/09800.jpg)  \nTHE CENTRAL PART OF THE FIFTH LAYER.\n\nquadrant, the one lying immediately south of the 'spine,' and the other\nimmediately east of the 'cross-spine.' It is an awkward fact, however, that\none of. the commentators on the Sutra referred to, states that there are to be\ntwo half-foot bricks, (one) on each side of the spine--that is, as would seem,\nthe 'cross-spine.' I cannot but think, however, that this must be a mistake,\nas otherwise it would seem to make the construction of a continuous ring\nimpossible. Inside this ring, on the adjoining range (viz. the _Ri_ tavya p.\n99 range, being the fifth range from the centre, see the diagram of the first\nlayer, [p. 17](sbe4305.htm#page_17)), five Nakasads (n) are placed on the\nspines, with the exception of the eastern one, which is to be placed in the\nsecond space north of the spine, that is to say, a foot from it (so as to\nleave space between it and the spine for the left Ritavya; cf. [VIII, 7, 1,\n11](sbe4326.htm#8:7:1:11), with note). In the south two half-sized bricks are\nlaid down instead of one full-sized one. All these five bricks are of half the\nusual thickness so as to allow five others, the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ u _d_ as (p),\nbeing placed upon them. Of the _kh_ andasyas, or bricks representing the\nmetres, only three sets (of three bricks each, viz. a full-sized one flanked\non either side by a half-sized one) fall within the circle formed by the\nstomabhaga-ring, viz. the trish _t_ ubhs (t), _g_ agatis ( _g_ ), and anush\n_t_ ubhs (a). The remaining space in the centre is now filled up by the\nGarhapatya hearth, consisting of eight bricks. Thereon is placed a second\nlayer of eight bricks exactly corresponding to the first, and called Puna _s_\n_k_ iti. This pile (marked by hatching in the sketch) thus rises above the\nfifth layer by the full depth of a brick. He then lays down the two _Ri_\ntavyas ( _ri_ t) just within the ring on the east side; and the Vi _s_ va _g_\nyotis (v), representing the sun, immediately west of them. Having now filled\nup the available spaces of the layer with Lokamp _ri_ _n_ as, and scattered\nloose soil on it, he finally lays down two perforated bricks (marked in the\nsketch by cross-hatching), the Vikar _n_ i and the Svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a, so\nthat the latter lies exactly in the centre, and the former immediately north\nof it, over the 'cross-spine.'\n\n[100:1](sbe4323.htm#fr_182) Or, perhaps, 'the Vasus are thy divine overlords;'\nbut see [paragraph 9](sbe4323.htm#8:6:1:9).\n\n[100:2](sbe4323.htm#fr_183) Lit. for unwaveringness (so as not to totter).\n\n[100:3](sbe4323.htm#fr_184) Lit. broaden, widen.\n\n[100:4](sbe4323.htm#fr_185) See VI, 1, 1, 1; [VII, 2, 3,\n5](sbe4309.htm#8:2:3:5).\n\n[100:5](sbe4323.htm#fr_186) See VI, 1, 1, 8.\n\n[101:1](sbe4323.htm#fr_187) That is, the southern of the two half-sized ones\nto be placed in this quarter.\n\n[102:1](sbe4323.htm#fr_188) That is, he lays down a half-sized brick\nimmediately north of the southern one, and thus in the direction of the centre\nfrom that brick.\n\n[103:1](sbe4323.htm#fr_189) That is, the offices of Hotrakas, or assistants to\nthe Hot _ri_.\n\n[103:2](sbe4323.htm#fr_190) These bricks would seem to have had some kind of\nprotuberances or bulgings ( _k_ u _d_ a), or perhaps tufts, resembling a man's\ncrest-lock or top-knot ( _k_ u _d_ a). Possibly, however, these five bricks,\np. 104 being placed on the top of the Nakasads, are themselves here\nrepresented as something additional. Such, at any rate, seems to be the\ndefinition of the term given in the text above and in [parag.\n13](sbe4323.htm#8:6:1:13). The MS. of the commentary reads, 'kayasya vai tat\npavar _g_ ita _m_ (!) sa _k_ u _d_ a _h_ ke _s_ apu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a _h_.'\n\n[104:1](sbe4323.htm#fr_191) This, doubtless, is here the meaning of mithunam;\nand similarly in I, 7, 2, 11, we ought to translate, 'The vasha _t_ kara is\nthe mate of those two (anuvakya and ya _g_ ya).'\n\n[104:2](sbe4323.htm#fr_192) See [paragraph 21](sbe4323.htm#8:6:1:21).\n\n[105:1](sbe4323.htm#fr_193) See [p. 3](sbe4303.htm#page_3), note\n[2](sbe4303.htm#fn_36).\n\n[105:2](sbe4323.htm#fr_194) That is, 'skilled in chariot (-fight),' and\n'mighty in chariot (-fight).'\n\n[105:3](sbe4323.htm#fr_195) The meaning of these names is rather obscure: the\nsymbolical explanations 'army and battle' might seem to point to some such\nmeanings as 'grounded on heaps' and 'grounded on intelligence (or plan).'\n\n[107:1](sbe4323.htm#fr_196) That is, extending in every direction, or open\n(common) to all.\n\n[107:2](sbe4323.htm#fr_197) Lit.
