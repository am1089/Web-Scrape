XII.\n\nMiscellaneous obligations--purificatory, ceremonial, and moral.\n\nAURVA continued.--"Let a respectable householder ever venerate the gods, kine,\nBrahmans, saints, aged persons, and holy teachers. Let him observe the two\ndaily Sandhyas, and offer oblations to fire. Let him dress in untorn garments,\nuse delicate herbs and flowers, wear emeralds and other precious stones, keep\nhis hair smooth and neat, scent his person with agreeable perfumes, and always\ngo handsomely attired, decorated with garlands of white flowers. Let him never\nappropriate another\'s property, nor address him with the least unkindness. Let\nhim always speak amiably and with truth, and never make public another\'s\nfaults. Let him not desire another\'s prosperity, nor seek his enmity. Let him\nnot mount upon a crazy vehicle, nor take shelter under the bank of a river\n(which may fall upon him). A wise man will not form a friendship nor walk in\nthe same path with one who is disesteemed, who is a sinner or a drunkard, who\nhas many enemies, or who is lousy, with a harlot or her gallant, with a pauper\nor a liar, with a prodigal, a slanderer, or a knave. Let not a man bathe\nagainst the strength of a rapid stream, nor enter a house on fire, nor climb\nto the top of a tree; nor (in company) clean his teeth or blow his nose, nor\ngape without covering his mouth, nor clear his throat, nor cough, nor laugh\nloudly, nor emit wind with noise, nor bite his nails, nor cut grass, nor\nscratch the ground 1, nor put his beard into his mouth, nor crumble a clod of\nclay; nor look upon the chief planetary bodies when he is unclean. Let him not\nexpress disgust at a corpse, for the odour of a dead body is the produce of\nthe moon. Let a decent man ever avoid by night the place where four roads\nmeet, the village tree, the grove adjacent to the place where bodies are\nburnt, and a loose woman. Let him not pass across the shadow of a venerable\nperson, of an image, of a deity, of a flag, of a heavenly luminary 2. Let him\nnot travel alone through a forest, nor sleep by\n\np. 311\n\nhimself in an empty house 3. Let him keep remote from hair, bones, thorns,\nfilth, remnants of offerings, ashes, chaff, and earth 4 wet with water in\nwhich another has bathed. Let him not receive the protection of the unworthy,\nnor attach himself to the dishonest. Let him not approach a beast of prey; and\nlet him not tarry long when he has risen from sleep. Let him not lie in bed\nwhen he is awake, nor encounter fatigue when it is time to rest. A prudent man\nwill avoid, even at a distance, animals with tusks and horns; and he will shun\nexposure to frost, to wind, and to sunshine. A man must neither bathe, nor\nsleep, nor rinse his mouth whilst he is naked 5: he must not wash his mouth,\nor perform any sacred rite, with his waistband unfastened: and he must not\noffer oblations to fire, nor sacrifice to the gods, nor wash his mouth, nor\nsalute a Brahman, nor utter a prayer, with only one garment on. Let him never\nassociate with immoral persons: half an instant is the limit for the\nintercourse of the righteous with them. A wise man will never engage in a\ndispute with either his superiors or inferiors: controversy and marriage are\nto be permitted only between equals. Let not a prudent man enter into\ncontention: let him avoid uprofitable enmity. A small loss may be endured; but\nhe should shun the wealth that is acquired by hostility.\n\n"When a man has bathed, he must not wipe his limbs with a towel nor with his\nhands, nor shake his hair, nor rinse his mouth before he has risen. Let him\nnot (when sitting) put one foot over another, nor stretch forth his foot, in\nthe presence of a superior, but sit with modesty in the posture called\nVirasana (or on his knees). He must never pass round a temple upon his left\nhand, nor perform the ceremony of circumambulating any venerable object in the\nreverse direction. A decent man will not spit, nor eject any impurity, in\nfront of the moon, fire, the sun, water, wind, or any respectable person 6;\nnor will he void urine standing, nor upon the highway: he will never step over\nphlegm, ordure, urine, or blood; nor is the expectoration of the mucus of the\nthroat allowable at the time of eating, offering sacrifices or oblations, or\nrepeating prayers, or in the presence of a respectable person.\n\np. 312\n\n"Let not a man treat women with disrespect, nor let him put entire faith in\nthem. Let him not deal impatiently with them, nor set them over matters of\nimportance. A man who is attentive to the duties of his station will not go\nforth from his house without saluting the chaplets, flowers, gems, clarified\nbutter, and venerable persons in it. At proper seasons he will salute\nrespectfully the places where four roads meet, when engaged in offering\noblations with fire. Let him liberally relieve the virtuous who are poor, and\nreverence those who are learned in the Vedas. He who is a worshipper of the\ngods and sages, who gives cakes and water to the manes, and who exercises\nhospitality, obtains the highest regions after death. He who speaks wisely,\nmoderately, and kindly, goes to those worlds which are the inexhaustible\nsources of happiness. He who is intelligent, modest, devout, and who\nreverences wisdom, his superiors, and the aged, goes to heaven.\n\n"On the days called Parvas, on periods of impurity, upon unseasonable thunder,\nand the occurrence of eclipses or atmospheric portents, a wise man must desist\nfrom the study of the Vedas 7. The pious man who suppresses anger and envy,\nwho is benevolent to all, and allays the fears of others, secures, as the\nleast of his rewards, enjoyment in Swarga. A man should carry an umbrella, as\na defence against sun and rain; he should bear a staff when he goes by night,\nor through a wood; and he should walk in shoes, if he desires to keep his body\nfrom harm. As he goes along he should not look up, nor about him, nor afar\noff, but keep his eyes upon the ground to the extent of a couple of yards.\n\n"The householder who expels all sources of imperfection is in a great degree\nacquitted of the three ordinary objects of existence, desire, wealth, and\nvirtue; sinless amongst the sinful; speaking amicably to all men; his whole\nsoul melting with benevolence; final felicity is in his grasp. The earth is\nupheld by the veracity of those who have subdued their passions, and,\nfollowing righteous practices, are never contaminated by desire, covetousness,\nand wrath. Let therefore a wise man ever speak the truth when it is agreeable,\nand when the truth would inflict\n\np. 313\n\npain let him hold his peace. Let him not utter that which, though acceptable,\nwould be detrimental; for it were better to speak that which would be\nsalutary, although it should give exceeding offence 8. A considerate man will\nalways cultivate, in act, thought, and speech, that which is good for living\nbeings, both in this world and in the next 9."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[310:1](vp086.htm#fr_858) Manu, IV. 71.
