Having performed the sacrifice they betake themselves to the\npurificatory bath; for after a Soma-sacrifice they do betake themselves to the\npurificatory bath, and the Sautrama _n_ i is the same as the Soma (sacrifice).\n\n12:9:2:22\\. [He plunges the mash-pot into the water, with Va _g_. S. XX, 14-18\n1,] 'Whatever contumely\n\np. 265\n\nagainst the gods, O divine gods, we have committed, from that sin may Agni\ndeliver me; may he deliver me from all trouble!'--he thereby delivers him from\nthe sin committed against the gods.--'Whether by day, whether by night we have\ncommitted sins, from that sin may Vayu deliver me; may he deliver me from all\ntrouble!'--he thereby delivers him from whatever sin he commits by day and\nnight.---'Whether waking, whether in sleep we have committed sins, from that\nsin may Surya deliver me; may he deliver me from all trouble!'--what is awake\nis men, and what is asleep is the Fathers: he thus delivers him from guilt\nagainst men and Fathers.\n\n12:9:2:33\\. 'Whatever sin we have committed in the village, in the forest'--\nfor either in the village or in the forest sin is committed: therefrom he\ndelivers him;--'whatever in the assembly'--from the sin of the assembly he\nthereby delivers him;--'whatever in our organs of sense'--from the sin against\nthe gods he thereby delivers him;--'whatever against the _S_ udra or the Arya,\nwhatever against the right of any one, thereof thou art the expiation,'--from\nall that sin he thereby delivers him.\n\n12:9:2:44\\. 'That we swear by the Inviolable Waters 1, by Varu _n_ a,\ntherefrom deliver us, O Varu _n_ a!'--he thereby delivers him from sin against\nVaru _n_ a.[He then immerses the pot, with Va _g_. S. XII, 18; 19,]\n\np. 266\n\n[paragraph continues] 'O laving bath, laving thou glidest along,'--the bath,\nindeed, is that whirlpool (now produced) in the water, and that indeed is\neither Varu _n_ a's son or brother: it is him he thereby praises;--'with the\nhelp of the gods have I expiated 1 the sin committed against gods,'--he\nthereby expiates the sin committed against gods;--'with the help of mortals\nthat committed against mortals,'--he thereby expiates the sin committed\nagainst mortals;--'preserve me, O God, from injury from the fiercely-howling\n(demon)!' whereby he means to say, 'Protect me against all inflictions!'\n\n12:9:2:55\\. 'In the ocean, in the waters, is thy heart,'--for the ocean is the\nwaters, and water is sap: with that sap he thus supplies him;--'may the plants\nand waters unite with thee!'--he thereby supplies him with both kinds of sap,\nthat which is in plants, and that which is in water--He goes two steps\nnorthward from out (of the water); for as much as the step is the briskness in\nman: with what briskness there is in him he thus leaves evil behind him.\n\n12:9:2:66\\. With, 'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us!' he takes\nwater in his joined hands; for water is a thunderbolt: he thus makes a\ncovenant with the thunderbolt;--and with, 'May they he unfriendly unto him who\nhateth us, and whom we hate!' let him sprinkle it in whatever direction he who\nis hateful to him may be, and he thereby discomfits him.\n\n12:9:2:77\\. With (Va _g_. S. XX, 20), 'As one set free (is liberated) from the\nstake, as he who sweateth\n\np. 267\n\n[paragraph continues] (is cleansed) from filth by bathing, as the ghee is\npurified by the strainer, so may the waters cleanse me from sin!' he causes\nhis garment to float away: even as one would pluck out a reed from its sheath,\nso he plucks him from out all evil. He bathes, and (thereby) drives the\ndarkness (of sin) from himself.\n\n12:9:2:88\\. [He comes out 1, with Va _g_. S. XX, 21,] 'From out of the gloom\nhave we risen,'--gloom is evil: it is gloom, evil, he thus keeps\naway;--'beholding the higher light 2,'--this (terrestrial) world is higher\nthan the water: it is on this world he thus establishes himself;--'God Surya,\nwith the gods, the highest light,'--Surya, the highest light ( _g_ yotis), is\nthe heavenly world: it is in the heavenly world he thus finally establishes\nhimself. He walks along without looking back, and approaches the \xc3\x82havaniya,--\n\n12:9:2:99\\. With (Va _g_. S. XX, 22), 'Along the waters have I gone this day,'\n--the essence of the waters he thereby secures for himself;---'with their\nessence have we united,'--the essence of the waters he thus takes to\nhimself;--'rich in sap, O Agni, have I come: do thou unite (supply) me with\nsplendour, with offspring, and with wealth!' he thereby invokes a blessing.\n\n12:9:2:1010\\. With (Va _g_. S. XX, 23), 'A kindler thou art:\n\np. 268\n\nmay we prosper 1!' he takes a kindling-stick, for a kindler of Agni (the fire)\nthe kindling-stick indeed is. With, 'Enkindling thou art, fire thou art: lay\nthou fire into me!' he puts the kindling-stick on the \xc3\x82havaniya: he thereby\nkindles the fire, and, thus kindled, it kindles him with fire (energy) 2.\n\n12:9:2:1111\\. Being about to offer a pap to Aditi 3, he prepares it: Aditi\nbeing this (earth), he who offers Aditi's (pap) performs the sacrifice on this\n(earth), and by offering firmly establishes himself thereon. The sacrificial\nfee is a milch cow (with calf): the milch cow being this (earth), he milks out\nfrom the latter all his desires. The calf he gives away at the former (pap-\noffering to Aditi 4), and the mother-cow at the latter; for when a calf sucks\nthe mother-cow, the latter gives milk when she is given away, and from her,\nwhen given away, he thus milks all his desires.\n\n12:9:2:1212\\. As to this they say, 'Surely, he who goes down to the water for\nthe purificatory bath falls away from this world!' Well, when he has come out\nfrom the bath, he offers a dish of curds to Mitra and Varu _n_ a; now Mitra is\nthis (terrestrial) world,\n\np. 269\n\n[paragraph continues] Varu _n_ a yonder world, and the dish of curds is what\nthere is here between (those two): thus, when he offers the dish of curds to\nMitra and Varu _n_ a, he establishes himself in these worlds. And Mitra,\nindeed, is the in-breathing, Varu _n_ a the off-breathing, and the dish of\ncurds the food: thus when he offers the dish of curds to Mitra and Varu _n_ a,\nhe finally establishes himself in the vital air, in food.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[264:1](sbe44072.htm#fr_664) Of the first three verses the text quotes only\nthe first pada, the rest having been supplied in the translation.\n\n[265:1](sbe44072.htm#fr_665) Cf. III, 8, 5, 10, where the text varies\nslightly--'That they say, we swear by the Inviolable (cows, or waters), by\nVaru _n_ a, therefrom deliver us, O Varu _n_ a!'\n\n[266:1](sbe44072.htm#fr_666) Cf. II, 5, 2, 47; IV, 4, 5, 22, where the formula\nhas 'ava ayasisham' (correct,--'with the help of the gods have I wiped out the\nsin committed against the gods') instead of 'ava yakshi.'\n\n[267:1](sbe44072.htm#fr_667) Having put on fresh garments, the Sacrificer and\nhis wife are led out by the Unnet _ri_ , the mantra being muttered at the same\ntime; and they then return with the priests to the offering-ground, whilst the\n\xc3\x82matriya-hymn (on _Ri_ g-veda S. VIII, 48, 3, 'we have drunk Soma . . .') is\nsung: see part ii, p. 385, note 2; Katy. _S_ raut. X, 9, 7.\n\n[267:2](sbe44072.htm#fr_668) Mahidhara takes 'svar' in the sense of 'svarga,'\nheaven; whilst the Brahma _n_ a seems rather to take it as referring to the\nearth or dry land on which the Sacrificer now steps.\n\n[268:1](sbe44072.htm#fr_669) The text of the formula 'edho\xe0\xa4\xbdsy edhishimahi' is\nevidently meant to suggest a connection (real or alliterative) between 'edha'\n(root 'indh') and the final verb (root 'edh').\n\n[268:2](sbe44072.htm#fr_670) According to Katy. XIX, 5, 20, and Mahidhara, he\nnow offers on the kindling-stick an oblation of ghee, with the text, Va _g_.\nS. XX, 23, 'Hither come the earth, the dawn, the sun, and all this world.'\n\n[268:3](sbe44072.htm#fr_671) See [p. 213](sbe44064.htm#page_213), note\n[2](sbe44065.htm#fn_564).\n\n[268:4](sbe44072.htm#fr_672) This offering takes place at the beginning of the\nperformance of the Sautrama _n_ i, cf. Katy. _S_ r. XIX, 1, 5-10. The dish of\ncurds which according to this paragraph is to follow the second pap to Aditi,\nmay, according to Katyayana, be offered before it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 9, 3.
