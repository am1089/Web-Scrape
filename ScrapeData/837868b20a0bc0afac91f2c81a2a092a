But unfortunately they have been deprived of their share of it, even\nin wholesome measure, both by the Fates presiding at the making of their\nhistory as well as by the guests partaking of their salt. We have been\ndeclared inefficient in practical matters by our governors, foreign\nmissionaries have created a vast literature proclaiming our moral obliquity,\nwhile casual visitors have expressed their opinion that we are particularly\nuninteresting to the intellectual mind of the West. Other peoples' estimate of\nour work is a great part of our world, and the most important other peoples in\nthe present age being the Europeans, it has become tragic in its effect for us\nto be unable to evoke their appreciation. There was a time when India could\ntouch the most sensitive part of Europe's mind by storming her imagination\nwith a gorgeous vision of wealth. But cruel time has done its work and the\ngolden illusion has vanished, leaving the ragged poverty of India open to\npublic inspection, charitable or otherwise. Therefore epithets of a\ndisparaging nature from the West find an easy target in India, bespattering\nher skin and piercing her vital parts. Epithets once given circulation die\nhard, for they have their breeding-places in our mental laziness and in our\nnatural readiness to believe that whatever is different from ourselves\n\np. vi\n\nmust be offensive. Men can live through and die happy in spite of\ndisparagement, if it comes from critics with whom they have no dealings. But\nunfortunately our critics not only have the power to give us a bad name, but\nalso to hang us. They play the part of Providence over three hundred millions\nof aliens whose language they hardly know, and with whom their acquaintance is\nof the surface. Therefore the vast accumulation of calumny against India,\ncontinually growing and spreading over the earth, secretly and surely\nobstructs the element of heart from finding an entrance into our government.\n\nOne can never do justice from a mere sense of duty to those for whom one lacks\nrespect. And human beings, as we are, justice is not the chief thing that we\nclaim from our rulers. We need sympathy as well, in order to feel that we have\nhuman relationship with them and thus retain as much of our self-respect as\nmay be possible.\n\nFor some time past a spirit of retaliation has taken possession of our\nliterature and our social world. We have furiously begun to judge our judges,\nand the judgment comes from hearts sorely stricken with hopeless humiliation.\nAnd because our thoughts have an organ whose sound does not reach outside our\ncountry, or even the ears of our governors within its boundaries, their\nexpression is growing in vehemence. The prejudice cultivated on the side of\nthe powerful is no doubt dangerous for the weak, but it cannot be wise on the\npart of the strong to ignore that thorny crop grown on the opposite field. The\nupsetting of truth in the relationship of the ruler and the ruled can never be\ncompensated by the power that lies in the grip of the mailed fist.\n\nAnd this was the reason which made us deeply\n\np. vii\n\ngrateful to Sister Nivedita, that great-hearted Western woman, when she gave\nutterance to her criticism of Indian life. She had won her access to the\ninmost heart of our society by her supreme gift of sympathy. She did not come\nto us with the impertinent curiosity of a visitor, nor did she elevate herself\non a special high perch with the idea that a bird's eye view is truer than the\nhuman view because of its superior aloofness. She lived our life and came to\nknow us by becoming one of ourselves. She became so intimately familiar with\nour people that she had the rare opportunity of observing us unawares. As a\nrace we have our special limitations and imperfections, and for a foreigner it\ndoes not require a high degree of keen-sightedness to detect them. We know for\ncertain that these defects did not escape Nivedita's observation, but she did\nnot stop there to generalize, as most other foreigners do. And because she had\na comprehensive mind and extraordinary insight of love she could see the\ncreative ideals at work behind our social forms and discover our soul that has\nliving connexion with its past and is marching towards its fulfilment.\n\nBut Sister Nivedita, being an idealist, saw a great deal more than is usually\nseen by those foreigners who can only see things, but not truths. Therefore I\nhave heard her being discredited by the authority of long experience, which is\nmerely an experience of blindness carried through long years. And of these I\nhave the same words to say which I said to those foreign residents of Japan,\nwhose long experience itself was like a film obscuring the freshness of their\nsight, making them conscious of only some outer details, specially where they\nirritated their minds. Instead of looking on the picture side of the canvas,\nif they look on the blank side it will not give any\n\np. viii\n\nmore value to their view because of the prolonged period of their staring.\n\nThe mental sense, by the help of which we feel the spirit of a people, is like\nthe sense of sight, or of touch--it is a natural gift. It finds its objects,\nnot by analysis, but by direct apprehension. Those who have not this vision\nmerely see events and facts, and not their inner association. Those who have\nno ear for music, hear sounds, but not the song. Therefore when, by reason of\nthe mere lengthiness of their suffering, they threaten to establish the fact\nof the tune to be a noise, one need not be anxious about the reputation of the\nmusic. Very often it is the mistakes which require a longer time to develop\ntheir tangles, while the right answer comes promptly.\n\nIt is a truism to say that shadows accompany light. What you feel as the truth\nof a people, has its numberless contradictions, just as the single fact of the\nroundness of the earth is contradicted by the innumerable facts of its hills\nand hollows. Facts can easily be arranged and heaped up into loads of\ncontradiction; yet men having faith in the reality of ideals hold firmly that\nthe vision of truth does not depend upon its dimension, but upon its vitality.\nAnd Sister Nivedita has uttered the vital truths about Indian life.\n\nRABINDRANATH TAGORE\n\n_October_ 21, 1917\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter I.
