[1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 26\n\n11:2:2\n\n### SECOND BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n11:2:2:11\\. He recites a gayatri invitatory formula 1: the gayatri consisting\nof three feet, these worlds being three in number 2, it is these worlds the\ngods thereby established.\n\n11:2:2:22\\. He offers with a trish _t_ ubh (verse): the trish _t_ ubh\nconsisting of four feet, and cattle being four-footed, it is cattle the gods\nthereby established in these established worlds.\n\n11:2:2:33\\. The Vasha _t_ -call consists of two syllables (vausha _t_ ): man\nbeing two-footed; it is two-footed man they thereby established among the\nestablished cattle.\n\n11:2:2:44\\. Two-footed man, then, is established here among cattle. In like\nmanner this (Sacrificer) establishes thereby the worlds; and in the\nestablished worlds he establishes cattle, and among the established cattle he\nestablishes himself: thus, indeed, is that man established among cattle, who,\nknowing this, offers sacrifice.\n\n11:2:2:55\\. And when he offers, after the Vasha _t_ has been uttered,--that\nVasha _t_ -call being yonder shining (sun), and he being the same as Death\n3\\--he thereby consecrates him (the Sacrificer) after death, and causes him to\nbe born from out of it, and he is\n\np. 27\n\ndelivered from that death. And the sacrifice, indeed, becomes his body: thus,\nhaving become the sacrifice, he is delivered from that death, and all his\nchief offerings are thereby delivered from that death 1.\n\n11:2:2:66\\. And, verily, whatever offering he there performs, that offering\nbecomes his body in yonder world; and when he who knows this departs this\nworld then that offering, being behind him, calls out to him, 'Come hither,\nhere I am, thy body;' and inasmuch as it calls out (invokes, ahvayati), it is\ncalled 'ahuti' (offering or invocation).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[26:1](sbe44012.htm#fr_132) The anuvakyas recited prior to the principal\noblations (pradhana-havis) are in the gayatri metre; whilst the ya _g_ yas\n(referred to in the next paragraph), at the end of which the Vausha _t_! is\nuttered and the oblation poured into the fire, consist of trish _t_ ubh\nverses; cf. 1, 7, 2, 15.\n\n[26:2](sbe44012.htm#fr_133) These inserted clauses with 'vai' supply the\nreason for what follows, not for what precedes, them.\n\n[26:3](sbe44012.htm#fr_134) See X, 5, 1, 4.\n\n[27:1](sbe44012.htm#fr_135) Viz. inasmuch as the oblation is made with the\nVasha _t_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 2, 3.
