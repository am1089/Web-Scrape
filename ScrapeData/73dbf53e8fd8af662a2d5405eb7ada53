S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! There are the six kinds of \xc3\x82chamana\n:-- (1) S\xc2\x92uddha, (2) Smarta, (3) Paura _n_ ik, (4) Vaidik, (5) Tantrik and(6)\nS\xc2\x92rauta. The act of cleaning after evacuating oneself of urine and faeces is\nknown as S\xc2\x92uddha S\xc2\x92aucha. After cleaning, the \xc3\x82chaman, that is\n\n\n\np. 1062\n\n\n\nperformed according to rules, is named as Smarta and Paura _n_ ik. In places\nwhere the Brahma Yaj\xc3\xb1a is performed, the Vaidik and S\xc2\x92rauta \xc3\x82chamanas are\ndone. And where acts, e.g., the knowledge of warfare are being executed, the\nTantrik \xc3\x82chaman is done. Then he is to remember the Gayatri Mantra with Pra\n_n_ ava (Om) and fasten the lock of hair on the crown of his head, thus\ncontrolling all the hindrances (Bighna Bandhanam). Sipping again, he is to\ntouch his heart, two arms, and his two shoulders. After sneezing, spitting,\ntouching the lower lip with teeth, accidentally telling a lie, and talking\nwith a very sinful man, he is to touch his right ear (where the several Devas\nreside). On the right ear of the Brahma _n_ as reside Fire, Water, the Vedas,\nthe Moon, the Sun, and the Vayu (wind). Then one is to go to a river or any\nother reservoir of water, and there to perform one's morning ablutions and to\ncleanse his body thoroughly. For the body is always unclean and dirty and\nvarious diets are being excreted out of the nine holes (doors) in the body.\nThe morning bath removes all these impurities. Therefore the morning bath is\nessentially necessary. The sins that arise from going to those who are not fit\nfor such purposes, from accepting gifts from impure persons or from the\npractice of any other secret vices all are removed by the morning ablutions.\nWithout this bath, no acts bear any fruit. Therefore everyday, this morning\nbath is very necessary. Taking the Kus'a grass in hand, one is to perform\none's bath and Sandhya. If for seven days, the morning ablutions are not\ntaken, and if for three days, the Sandhyas are not performed, if for twelve\ndays, the daily Homas be not performed, the Brahma _n_ as become S\xc2\x92udras. The\ntime for making the Homa in the morning is very little; therefore lest\nablutions be done fully which would take a long time and hence the time for\nthe Homa might elapse, the morning bath should be performed quickly. After the\nbath the Pra _n_ ayama is to be done. Then the full effects of bath are\nattained. There is nothing holier in this world or in the next than reciting\nthe Gayatri. It saves the singer who sings the Gayatri; hence it is called\nGayatri. During the time of Pra _n_ ayama, one must control one's Pra _n_ a\nand Apa _n_ a Vayus, i.e., make them equal. The Brahmi _n_ , knowing the Vedas\nand devoted to his Dharma, must practise Pranayama three times with the\nrepetition of Gayatri and Pra _n_ ava and the three Vyarhitis (Om Bhu, Om\nBhuvar, Om Sva _h_ ).\n\n\n\nWhile practising, the muttering of Gayatri is to be done three times. In\nPranayama, the Vaidik mantra is to be repeated, never a Laukika Mantra is to\nbe uttered. At the time of Pranayama, if anybody's mind be not fixed, even for\na short while, like a mustard seed on the apex of a cow-horn, he cannot save\neven one hundred-and one persons in his father's\n\n\n\np. 1063\n\n\n\nor in his mother's line. Pranayama is called Sagarbha when performed with the\nrepetition of some mantra; it is called Agarbha when it is done simply with\nmere meditation, without repeating any mantra. After the bathing, the Tarpa\n_n_ am with its accompaniments, is to he done; i.e., the peace offerings are\nmade with reference to the Devas, the Ri _s_ is, and the Pitris (whereby we\ninvoke the blessings from the subtle planes where the highsouled persons\ndwell). After this, a clean pair of clothes is to be worn and then he should\nget up and come out of the water. The next things preparatory to practise\nJapam are to wear the Tilaka marks of ashes and to put on the Rudrak _s_ a\nbeads. He who holds thirty-two Rudrak _s_ a beads on his neck, forty on his\nhead, six on each ear (12 on two ears), twenty four beads on two hands (twelve\non each hand) thirty-two beads on two arms (sixteen on each), one bead on each\neye and one bead on the hair on the crown, and one hundred and eight beads on\nthe breast, (251 in all) becomes himself Maha Deva. One is expected to use\nthem as such. O Muni! You can use the Rudrak _s_ as after tieing, stringing\ntogether with gold or silver always on your S\xc2\x92ikha, the tuft of hair on the\nhead or on your ears. On the holy thread, on the hands, on the neck, or on the\nbelly (abdomen) one can keep the Rudrak _s_ a after one has repeated sincerely\nand with devotion the five lettered mantra of S\xc2\x92iva, or one has repeated the\nPra _n_ ava (Om). Holding the Rudrak _s_ a implies that the man has realised\nthe knowledge of S\xc2\x92iva Tattva. O Brahma _n_! The Rudrak _s_ a bead that is\nplaced on the tuft or on the crown hair represents the Tara tattva, i.e., Om\nKara; the Rudrak _s_ a beads that are held on the two ears are to be thought\nof as Deva and Devi, (S\xc2\x92iva and S\xc2\x92iva).\n\n\n\n22-37. The one hundred and eight Rudrak _s_ a beads on the sacrificial thread\nare considered as the one hundred and eight Vedas (signifying the Full\nKnowledge, as sixteen digits of the Moon completed; on the arms, are\nconsidered as the Dik (quarters); on the neck, are considered as the Devi\nSarasvati and Agni (fire). The Rudrak _s_ a beads ought to be taken by men of\nall colours and castes. The Brahma _n_ as, K _s_ attriyas and Vais'yas should\nhold them after purifying them with Mantras, i.e., knowingly; whereas the\nS\xc2\x92udras can take them without any such purification by the Mantras, i.e.,\nunknowingly. By holding or putting on the Rudrak _s_ a beads, persons become\nthe Rudras incarnate in flesh and body. There is no doubt in this. By this all\nthe sins arising from seeing, hearing, remembering, smelling, eating\nprohibited things, talking incoherently, doing prohibited things, etc., are\nentirely removed with the Rudrak _s_ a beads on the body; whatever acts,\neating, drinking, smelling, etc., are done, are, as it were, done by Rudra\nDeva Himself. O Great Muni! He who feels\n\n\n\np. 1064\n\n\n\nshame in holding and putting on the Rudrak _s_ a beads, can never be freed\nfrom this Samsara even after the Ko _t_ i births. He who blames another person\nholding Rudrak _s_ a beads has defects in his birth (is a bastard). There is\nno doubt in this. It is by holding on Rudrak _s_ a that Brahma has remained\nsteady in His Brahmahood untainted and the Munis have been true to their\nresolves. So there is no act better and higher than holding the Rudrak _s_ a\nbeads. He who gives clothing and food to a person holding Rudrak _s_ a beads\nwith devotion is freed of all sins and goes to the S\xc2\x92iva Loka. He who feasts\ngladly any holder of such beads at the time of S\xc2\x92radh, goes undoubtedly to the\nPitri Loka. He who washes the feet of a holder of Rudrak _s_ a and drinks that\nwater, is freed of all sins and resides with honour in the S\xc2\x92iva Loka. If a\nBrahma _n_ a holds with devotion the Rudrak _s_ a beads with a necklace and\ngold, he attains the Rudrahood. O Intelligent One! Wherever whoever holds with\nor without faith and devotion the Rudrak _s_ a beads with or without any\nmantra, is freed of all sins and is entitled to the Tattvaj\xc3\xb1ana. I am unable\nto describe fully the greatness of the Rudrak _s_ a beads. In fact, all should\nby all means hold the Rudrak _s_ a beads on their bodies.\n\n\n\nNote :-- The number one hundred and eight (108) signifies the One Hundred and\nEight Vedas, the Brahma _n_ , the Source of all Wisdom and Joy.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Third Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the glories of the Rudrak\n_s_ a beads in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 4](bk11ch04.htm)\n\n"
