'Power (bala) is better than understanding. One powerful man shakes a\nhundred men of understanding. If a man is powerful, he becomes a rising man.\nIf he rises, he becomes a man who visits wise people. If he visits, he becomes\na follower of wise people. If he follows them, he becomes a seeing, a hearing,\na perceiving, a knowing, a doing, an understanding man. By power the earth\nstands firm, and the sky, and the heaven, and the mountains, gods and men,\ncattle, birds, herbs, trees, all beasts down to worms, midges, and ants; by\npower the world stands firm. Meditate on power.\n\n2\\. 'He who meditates on power as Brahman, is, as it were, lord and master as\nfar as power reaches--he who meditates on power as Brahman.'\n\n'Sir, is there something better than power?'\n\n'Yes, there is something better than power.'\n\n'Sir, tell it me.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 9](sbe01143.htm)\n\n"
