On account of scriptural statement of difference, and on account of\ndifference of characteristics.\n\nTexts such as 'from him is born pra _n_ a, and the internal organ, and all\norgans' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3) mention the vital breath separately from the\norgans, and this shows that the breath is not one of the organs. The passage\nindeed mentions the internal organ (manas) also as something separate; but in\nother passages the manas is formally included in the organs, 'the (five)\norgans with mind as the sixth' (Bha. Gi. XV, 7). That the vital breath differs\nin nature from the organ of sight and the rest, is a matter of observation.\nFor in the state of deep sleep the function of breath is seen to continue,\nwhile those of the eye, and so on, are not perceived. The work of the organs,\ninclusive of the manas, is to act as instruments of cognition and action,\nwhile the work of breath is to maintain the body and the organs. It is for the\nreason that the subsistence of the organs depends on breath, that the organs\nthemselves are called pra _n_ as. Thus Scripture says, 'they all became the\nform of that (breath), and therefore they are called after him pra _n_ as' (B\n_ri_. Up. I, 5, 21). 'They became\n\np. 578\n\nits form' means--they became its body, their activity depended on it.--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of'the _organs_.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 17.
