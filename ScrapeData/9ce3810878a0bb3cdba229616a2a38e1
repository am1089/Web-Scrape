Let him begin this day 2 with singing 'Him,' thus they say.\n\n2\\. Verily, the sound Him is Brahman, that day also is Brahman. He who knows\nthis, obtains Brahman even by Brahman.\n\n3\\. As he begins with the sound Him, surely that masculine sound of Him and\nthe feminine _Ri_ _k_ (the verse) make a couple. Thus he makes a couple at the\nbeginning of the hymn in order to get offspring 3. He who knows this, gets\ncattle and offspring.\n\n4\\. Or, as he begins with the sound Him, surely like a wooden spade, so the\nsound Him serves to dig up Brahman (the sap of the Veda). And as a man wishes\nto dig up any, even the hardest soil, with a spade, thus he digs up Brahman.\n\n5\\. He who knows this digs up, by means of the sound Him, everything he may\ndesire.\n\n6\\. If he begins with the sound Him, that sound is the holding apart of divine\nand human speech.\n\np. 177\n\nTherefore, he who begins, after having uttered the sound Him, holds apart\ndivine and human speech 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[176:2](sbe01188.htm#fr_429) The Nishkevalya- _s_ astra, of the noon-libation;\nCf.

Thus between the hymns, or the divine speech, and the\nordinary language of conversation the sound Him is interposed as a barrier.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 2](sbe01189.htm)\n\n"
