\nNext Sita, followed, fair to see,  \nAnd Lakshman with his bow in hand  \nWalked hindmost of the little band.  \nAs onward through the wood they went,  \nWith great delight their eyes were bent  \nOn rocky heights beside the way  \nAnd lofty trees with blossoms gay;  \nAnd streamlets running fair and fast  \nThe royal youths with Sita passed.  \nThey watched the saras and the drake  \nOn islets of the stream and lake,  \nAnd gazed delighted on the floods  \nBright with gay birds and lotus buds.  \nThey saw in startled herds the roes,  \nThe passion-frenzied buffaloes,  \nWild elephants who fiercely tore  \nThe tender trees, and many a boar.  \nA length of woodland way they passed,  \nAnd when the sun was low at last  \nA lovely stream-fed lake they spied,  \nTwo leagues across from side to side.  \nTall elephants fresh beauty gave  \nTo grassy bank and lilied wave,  \n\np. 240  \n\nBy many a swan and saras stirred,  \nMallard, and gay-winged water-bird.  \nFrom those sweet waters, loud and long,  \nThough none was seen to wake the song,  \nSwelled high the singer\'s music blent  \nWith each melodious instrument.  \nRama and car-borne Lakshman heard  \nThe charming strain, with wonder stirred,  \nTurned on the margent of the lake  \nTo Dharmabhait *  1 the sage, and spake:  \n  \'Our longing souls, O hermit, burn  \nThis music of the lake to learn:  \nWe pray thee, noblest sage, explain  \nThe cause of the mysterious strain.\'  \nHe, as the son of Raghu prayed,  \nWith swift accord his answer made,  \nAnd thus the hermit, virtuous-souled,  \nThe story of the fair lake told:  \n  \'Through every age \'tis known to fame,  \nPanchapsaras  2 its glorious name,  \nBy holy Mandakarni wrought  \nWith power his rites austere had bought.  \nFor he, great votarist, intent  \nOn strictest rule his stern life spent.  \nTen thousand years the stream his bed,  \nTen thousand years on air he fed.  \nThen on the blessed Gods who dwell  \nIn heavenly homes great terror fell:  \nThey gathered all, by Agni led,  \nAnd counselled thus disquieted:  \n\'The hermit by ascetic pain  \nThe seat of one of us would gain.\'  \nThus with their hearts by fear oppressed  \nIn full assembly spoke the Blest,  \nAnd bade five loveliest nymphs, as fair  \nAs lightning in the evening air,  \nArmed with their winning wiles, seduce  \nFrom his stern vows the great recluse.  \nThough lore of earth and heaven he knew,  \nThe hermit from his task they drew,  \nAnd made the great ascetic slave  \nTo conquering love, the Gods to save.  \nBach of the heavenly five became,  \nBound to the sage, his wedded dame;  \nAnd he, for his beloved\'s sake,  \nFormed a fair palace neath the lake.  \nUnder the flood the ladies live,  \nTo joy and ease their days they give,  \nAnd lap in bliss the hermit wooed  \nFrom penance rites to youth renewed.  \nSo when the sportive nymphs within  \nThose secret bowers their play begin,  \nYou hear the singers\' dulcet tones  \nBlend sweetly with their tinkling zones.\'  \n    \'How wondrous are these words of thine!\'  \nCried the famed chiefs of Raghu\'s line,  \n\nAs thus they heard the sage unfold  \nThe marvels of the tale he told.  \n   As Rama spake, his eyes were bent  \nUpon a hermit settlement  \nWith light of heavenly lore endued,  \nWith sacred grass and vesture strewed.  \nHis wife and brother by his side,  \nWithin the holy bounds he hied,  \nAnd there, with honour entertained  \nBy all the saints, a while remained.  \nIn time, by due succession led,  \nEach votary\'s cot he visited,  \nAnd then the lord of martial lore,  \nReturned where he had lodged before.  \nHere for the months, content, he stayed,  \nThere for a year his visit paid:  \nHere for four months his home would fix,  \nThere, as it chanced, for five or six.  \nHere for eight months and there for three  \nThe son of Raghu\'s stay would be:  \nHere weeks, there fortnights, more or less,  \nHe spent in tranquil happiness.  \nAs there the hero dwelt at ease  \nAmong those holy devotees,  \nIn days untroubled o\'er his head  \nTen circling years of pleasure fled.  \nSo Raghu\'s son in duty trained  \nA while in every cot remained,  \nThen with his dame retraced the road  \nTo good Sutikshna\'s calm abode.  \nHailed by the saints with honours due  \nNear to the hermit\'s home he drew,  \nAnd there the tamer of his foes  \nDwelt for a time in sweet repose.  \nOne day within that holy wood  \nBy saint Sutikstma Rama stood,  \nAnd thus the prince with reverence meek  \nTo that high sage began to speak:  \n   \'In the wide woodlands that extend  \nAround us, lord most reverend,  \nAs frequent voice of rumour tells,  \nAgastya, saintliest hermit, dwells.  \nSo vast the wood, I cannot trace  \nThe path to reach his dwelling place,  \nNor, searching unassisted, find  \nThat hermit of the thoughtful mind.  \nI with my wife and brother fain  \nWould go, his favour to obtain,  \nWould seek him in his lone retreat  \nAnd the great saint with reverence greet.  \nThis one desire, O Master, long  \nCherished within my heart, is strong,  \nThat I may pay of free accord  \nMy duty to that hermit lord.\'  \n   As thus the prince whose heart was bent  \nOn virtue told his firm intent,  \nThe good Sutikshna\'s joy rose high,  \nAnd thus in turn he made reply:  \nThe very thing, O Prince, which thou  \nHast sought, I wished to urge but now,  \nBid thee with wife and brother see  \n\np. 241  \n\nAgastya, glorious devotee.  \nI count this thing an omen fair  \nThat thou shouldst thus thy wish declare,  \nAnd I, my Prince, will gladly teach  \nThe way Agastya\'s home to reach.  \nSouthward, dear son, direct thy feet  \nEight leagues beyond this still retreat:  \nAgastya\'s hermit brother there  \nDwells in a home most bright and fair.  \n\'Tis on a knoll of woody ground,  \nWith many a branching Pippal  1 crowned:  \nThere sweet birds\' voices ne\'er are mute,  \nAnd trees are gay with flower and fruit.  \nThere many a lake gleams bright and cool,  \nAnd lilies deck each pleasant pool,  \nWhile swan, and crane, and mallard\'s wings  \nAre lovely in the water-springs.  \nThere for one night, O Rama, stay,  \nAnd with the dawn pursue thy way.  \nStill farther, bending southward, by  \nThe thicket\'s edge the course must lie,  \nAnd thou wilt see, two leagues from thence  \nAgastya\'s lovely residence,  \nSet in the woodland\'s fairest spot,  \nAll varied foliage decks the cot:  \nThere Si\'ta\', Lakshman thou, at ease  \nMay spend sweet hours neath shady trees,  \nFor all of noblest growth are found  \nLuxuriant on that *bosky ground,  \nIf it be still thy firm intent  \nTo see that saint pree*minent,  \nO mighty counsellor, this day  \nDepart upon thine onward way.\'  \n   The hermit spake, and Rama bent  \nHis head, with Lakshman, reverent,  \nAnd then with him and Janak\'s child  \nSet out to trace the forest wild.  \nHe saw dark woods that fringed the road,  \nAnd distant hills like clouds that showed,  \nAnd, as the way he followed, met  \nWith many a lake and rivulet.  \nSo passing on with ease where led  \nThe path Sutikshna bade him tread,  \nThe hero with exulting breast  \nHis brother in these words addressed:  \n   \'Here, surely, is the home, in sight,  \nOf that illustrious anchorite:  \nHere great Agastya\'s brother leads  \nA life intent on holy deeds.  \nWarned of each guiding mark and sign,  \nI see them all herein combine:  \nI see the branches bending low  \nBeneath the flowers and fruit they show.  \nA soft air from the forest springs,  \nFresh from the odorous grass, and brings  \nA spicy fragrance as it flees  \nO\'er the ripe fruit of Pippal trees.  \nSee, here and there around us high  \nPiled up in heaps cleft billets lie,  \n\nAnd holy grass is gathered, bright  \nAs strips of shining lazulite.  \nFull in the centre of the shade  \nThe hermits\' holy fire is laid:  \nI see its smoke the pure heaven streak  \nDense as a big cloud\'s dusky peak.  \nThe twice-born men their steps retrace  \nFrom each sequestered bathing place,  \nAnd each his sacred gift has brought  \nOf blossoms which his hands have sought.  \nOf all these signs, dear brother, each  \nAgrees with good Sutikshna\'s speech,  \nAnd doubtless in this holy bound  \nAgastya\'s brother will be found.  \nAgastya once, the worlds who viewed  \nWith love, a Deathlike fiend subdued,  \nAnd armed with mighty power, obtained  \nBy holy works, this grove ordained  \nTo be a refuge and defence  \nFrom all oppressors\' violence.  \nIn days of yore within this place  \nTwo brothers fierce of demon race,  \nVa\'ta\'pi* dire and Ilval, dwelt,  \nAnd slaughter mid the Bra\'hmans dealt.  \nA Bra\'hman\'s form, the fiend to cloak,  \nFierce Ilval wore, and Sanskrit spoke,  \nAnd twice-born sages would invite  \nTo solemnize some funeral rite.  \nHis brother\'s flesh, concealed within  \nA ram\'s false shape and borrowed skin,--  \nAs men are wont at funeral feasts,--  \nHe dressed and fed those gathered priests.  \nThe holy men, unweeting ill,  \nTook of the food and ate their fill.  \nThen Ilval with a mighty shout  \nExclaimed \'Vatapi, issue out.\'  \nSoon as his brother\'s voice he heard,  \nThe fiend with ram-like bleating stirred:  \nBending in pieces every frame,  \nForth from the dying priests he came.  \nSo they who changed their forms at will  \nThousands of Brahmans dared to kill,-  \nFierce fiends who loved each cruel deed,  \nAnd joyed on bleeding flesh to feed.  \nAgastya, mighty hermit, pressed  \nTo funeral banquet like the rest,  \nObedient to the Gods\' appeal  \nAte up the monster at a meal.  \n\'Tis done,\'tis done,\' fierce Ilval cried,  \nAnd water for his hands supplied:  \nThen lifting up his voice he spake:  \n\'Forth, brother, from thy prison break.\'  \nThen him who called the fiend, who long  \nHad wrought the suffering Bra\'hmans wrong,  \nThus thoughtful-souled Agastya, best  \nOf hermits, with a smile addresed:  \n\'How, Ra\'kshas, is the fiend empowered  \nTo issue forth whom I devoured?  \nThy brother in a ram\'s disguise-  \nIs gone where Yama\'s kingdom lies.\'  \n\np. 242  \n\nWhen from the words Agastya said  \nHe knew his brother fiend was dead,  \nHis soul on fire with vengeful rage,  \nRushed the night-rover at the sage.  \nOne lightning glance of fury, hot  \nAs fire, the glorious hermit shot,  \nAs the fiend neared him in his stride,  \nAnd straight, consumed to dust, he died.  \nIn pity for the Brahmans\' plight  \nAgastya wrought this deed of might:  \nThis grove which lakes and fair trees grace  \nIn his great brother\'s dwelling place.  \n   As Rama thus the tale rehearsed,  \nAnd with Sumitra\'s son conversed,  \nThe setting sun his last rays shed,  \nAnd evening o\'er the land was spread.  \nA while the princely brothers stayed  \nAnd even rites in order paid,  \nThen to the holy grove they drew  \nAnd hailed the saint with honour due.  \nWith courtesy was Rama met  \nBy that illustrious anchoret,  \nAnd for one night he rested there  \nRegaled with fruit and hermit fare.  \nBut when the night had reached its close,  \nAnd the sun\'s glorious circle rose,  \nThe son of Raghu left his bed  \nAnd to the hermit\'s brother said:  \n\'Well rested in thy hermit cell,  \nI stand, O saint, to bid farewell;  \nFor with thy leave I journey hence  \nThy broher saint to reverence.\'  \n\'Go, Rama go,\' the sage replied:  \nThen from the cot the chieftain hied.  \nAnd while the pleasant grove he viewed,  \nThe path the hermit showed, pursued.  \nOf every leaf, of changing hue.  \nPlants, trees by hundreds round him grew,  \nWith joyous eyes he looked on all,  \nThen Jak,  1 the wild rice, and Sal; 2  \nHe saw the red Hibiscus glow,  \nHe saw the flower-tipped creeper throw  \nThe glory of her clusters o\'er  \nTall trees that loads of blossom bore.  \nSome, elephants had prostrate laid,  \nIn some the monkeys leapt and played,  \nAnd through the whole wide forest rang  \nThe charm of gay birds as they sang.  \nThen Rama of the lotus eye  \nTo Lakshman turned who followed nigh,  \nAnd thus the hero youth impressed  \nWith Fortune\'s favouring signs, addressed:  \n   \'How soft the leaves of every tree,  \nHow tame each bird and beast we see!  \nSoon the fair home shall we behold  \nOf that great hermit tranquil-souled.  \nThe deed the good Agastya wrought  \n\nHigh fame throughout the world has bought:  \nI see, I see his calm retreat  \nThat balms the pain of weary feet.  \nWhere white clouds rise from flames beneath,  \nWhere bark-coats lie with many a wreath,  \nWhere silvan things, made gentle, throng,  \nAnd every bird is loud in song.  \nWith ruth for suffering creatures filled,  \nA deathlike fiend with might he killed,  \nAnd gave this southern realm to be  \nA refuge, from oppression free.  \nThere stands his home, whose dreaded might  \nHas put the giant crew to flight,  \nWho view with envious eyes afar  \nThe peaceful shades they cannot mar.  \nSince that most holy saint has made  \nHis dwelling in this lovely shade,  \nChecked by his might the giant brood  \nHave dwelt in peace with souls subdued.  \nAnd all this southern realm, within  \nWhose bounds no fiend may entrance win,  \nNow bears a name which naught may dim,  \nMade glorious through the worlds by him.  \nWhen Vindhya, best of hills, would stay  \nThe journey of the Lord of Day,  \nObedient to the saint\'s behest  \nHe bowed for aye his humbled crest.  \nThat hoary hermit, world-renowned  \nFor holy deeds, within this ground  \nHas set his pure and blessed home,  \nWhere gentle silvan creatures roam.  \nAgastya, whom the worlds revere,  \nPure saint to whom the good are dear,  \nTo us his guests all grace will show,  \nEnriched with blessings ere we go.  \nI to this aim each thought will turn,  \nThe favour of the saint to earn,  \nThat here in comfort may be spent  \nThe last years of our banishment.  \nHere sanctities and high saints stand,  \nGods, minstrels of the heavenly band;  \nUpon Agastya\'s will they wait,  \nAnd serve him, pure and temperate.  \nThe liar\'s tongue, the tyrant\'s mind  \nWithin these bounds no home may find:  \nNo cheat, no sinner here can be:  \nSo holy and so good is he.  \nHere birds and lords of serpent race,  \nSpirits and Gods who haunt the place,  \nContent with scanty fare remain,  \nAs merit\'s meed they strive to gain.  \nMade perfect here, the paints supreme,  \nOn cars that mock the Day-God\'s gleam,--  \nTheir mortal bodies cast aside,--  \nSought heaven transformed and glorified,  \nHere Gods to living things, who win  \nTheir favour, pure from cruel sin,  \nGive royal rule and many a good,  \n\np. 243  \n\nImmortal life and spirithood. I  \nNow, Lakshman, we are near the place:  \nDo thou precede a little space,  \nAnd tell the mighty saint that I  \nWith Sita at my side am nigh,"  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[240:1](ry209.htm#fr_424) One of the hermits who had followed Rama.\n\n[240:2](ry209.htm#fr_425) The lake of the five nymphs.\n\n[241:1](ry209.htm#fr_426) The holy fig-tree.\n\n[242:1](ry209.htm#fr_427) The bread-fruit tree, Artocarpus integri folia.\n\n[242:2](ry209.htm#fr_428) A fine timber tree, Shores robusta.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XII.: The Heavenly Bow.](ry210.htm)\n\n'
