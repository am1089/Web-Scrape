For instance,\n{07044} is the 44th verse of the 7th book. This is to assist in searching if\nyou know which verse you are looking for. Due to time considerations, I have\nomitted most of the introduction and the annotations.]\n\n## Excerpt from the Introduction\n\nThe present volume of translations comprises about one third of the entire\nmaterial of the Atharva-veda in the text of the Saunaka-school. But it\nrepresents the contents and spirit of the fourth Veda in a far greater measure\nthan is indicated by this numerical statement. The twentieth book of the\nSamhita, with the exception of the so-called kuntapasuktini (hymns 127-136),\nseems to be a verbatim repetition of mantras contained in the Rig-veda, being\nemployed in the Vaitana-sura at the sastras and stotras of the soma-sacrifice:\nit is altogether foreign to the spirit of the original Atharvan. The\nnineteenth book is a late addendum, in general very corrupt; its omission\n(with the exception of hymns 26, 34, 35, 38, 39, 53, and 54) does not detract\nmuch from the general impression left by the body of the collection. The\nseventeenth book consists of a single hymn of inferior interest. Again, books\nXV and XVI, the former entirely Brahmanical prose, the latter almost entirely\nso, are of doubtful quality and chronology. Finally, books XIV and XVIII\ncontain respectively the wedding and funeral stanzas of the Atharvan, and are\nlargely coincident with corresponding Mantras of the tenth book of the Rig-\nveda: they are, granted their intrinsic interest, not specifically Atharvanic.\nOf the rest of the Atharvan (books I-XIII) there is presented here about one\nhalf, naturally that half which seemed to the translator the most interesting\nand characteristic. Since not a little of the collection rises scarcely above\nthe level of mere verbiage, the process of exclusion has not called for any\ngreat degree of abstemiousness.\n\nThese successive acts of exclusion have made it possible to present a fairly\ncomplete history of each of the hymns translated. The employment of the hymns\nin the Atharvanic practices is in closer touch with the original purpose of\nthe composition or compilation of the hymns than is true in the case of the\nother collections of Vedic hymns. Many times, though by no means at all times,\nthe practices connected with a given hymn present the key to the correct\ninterpretation of the hymn itself. In any case it is instructive to see what\nthe Atharvan priests did with the hymns of their own school, even if we must\njudge their performances to be secondary.\n\nI do not consider any translation of the AV. at this time as final. The most\ndifficult problem, hardly as yet ripe for final solution, is the original\nfunction of many mantras, after they have been stripped of certain adaptive\nmodifications, imparted to them to meet the immediate purpose of the\nAtharvavedin. Not infrequently a stanza has to be rendered in some measure of\nharmony with its connection, when, in fact, a more original meaning, not at\nall applicable to its present environment, is but scantily covered up by the\n'secondary modifications of the text. This garbled tradition of the ancient\ntexts partakes of the character of popular etymology in the course of the\ntransmission of wofds. New meaning is read into the mantras, and any little\nstubbornness on their part is met with modifications of their wording. The\ncritic encounters here a very difficult situation: searching investigation of\nthe remaining Vedic collections is necessary before a bridge can be built from\nthe more original meaning to the meaning implied and required by the situation\nin a given Atharvan hymn. Needless to say the only correct and useful way to\ntranslate a mantra in the Atharvan, is to reproduce it with the bent which it\nhas received in the Atharvan. The other Vedic collections are by no means free\nfrom the same taint. The entire Vedic tradition, the Rig-veda not excepted,\npresents rather the conclusion than the beginning of a long period of literary\nactivity. Conventionality of subject-matter, style, form (metre), &c., betray\nthemselves at every step: the 'earliest' books of the RV. are not exempt from\nthe same processes of secondary grouping and adaptation of their mantras,\nthough these are less frequent and less obvious than is the case in the\nAtharva-veda.\n\nObligations to previous translators: Weber, Muir, Ludwig, Zimmer, Grill',\nHenry, &c., are acknowledged in the introduction to each hymn. I regret that\nthe work was in the hands of the printer prior to the appearance of Professor\nHenry's excellent version of books X-XII. The late lamented Professor Whitney\nkindly furnished me with the advance sheets of the late Shankar Pandurang\nPandit's scholarly edition of the AV. with Sayana's commentary, as also with\nmany of the readings of the Cashmir text (the so-called Paippalada-sakha) of\nthe AV. Neither the Paippalada nor Sayana sensibly relieves the task of its\ndifficulty and responsibility.\n\nMAURICE BLOOMFIELD.\n\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,  \nBALTIMORE: April, 1896.\n\n# HYMNS\n\n# OF THE\n\n# ATHARVA-VEDA.\n\n# I.\n\n# CHARMS TO CURE DISEASES AND POSSESSION BY DEMONS OF DISEASE (BHAISHAGYKNI).\n\n{05022}\n\n## V, 22. Charm against takman (fever) and related diseases.\n\n1\\. May Agni drive the takman away from here, may Soma, the press-stone, and\nVaruna, of tried skill; may the altar, the straw (upon the altar), and the\nbrightly-flaming fagots (drive him away)! Away to naught shall go the hateful\npowers!  \n2\\. Thou that makest all men sallow, inflarning them like a searing fire, even\nnow, O takman, thou shalt become void of strength: do thou now go away down,\naye, into the depths!  \nThe takman that is spotted, covered Nvith spots, like reddish sediment, him\nthou, (O plant) of unremitting potency, drive away down below!  \n4\\. Having made obeisance to the takman, I cast him down below: let him, the\nchampion of Sakambhara, return again to the Mahavrishas!  \n5\\. His home is with the Mugavants, his home with the Mahavrishas. From the\nmoment of thy birth thou art indigenous with the Balhikas.  \n6\\. O takman, vyala, vi gada, vyanga, hold off (thy missile) far! Seek the\ngadabout slave-girl, strike her with thy bolt!  \n7\\. O takman, go to the Mugavants, or to the Balhikas farther away! Seek the\nlecherous Sudra female: her, O takman, give a good shaking-up!  \n8\\. Go away to the Mahavrishas and the Mugavants, thy kinsfolk, and consume\nthem! Those (regions) do we bespeak for the takman, or these regions here\nother (than ours).  \n9\\. (If) in other regions thou dost not abide, mayest thou that art powerful\ntake pity on us! Takman, now, has become eager: he will go to the Balhikas.  \n10\\. When thou, being cold, and then again deliriously hot, accompanied by\ncough, didst cause the (sufferer) to shake, then, O takman, thy missiles were\nterrible: from these surely exempt us!  \n11\\. By no means ally thyself with balasa, cough and spasm! From there do thou\nnot return hither again: that, O takman, do I ask of thee!  \n12\\. O takman, along with thy brother balasa, along with thy sister cough,\nalong with thy cousin paman, go to yonder foreign folk!  \n13\\. Destroy the takman that returns on (each) third day, the one that\nintermits (each) third day, the one that continues without intermission, and\nthe autumnal one; destroy the cold takman, the hot, him that comes in summer,\nand him that arrives in the rainy season!  \n14\\. To the Gandharis, the Magavants, the Angas, and the Magadhas, we deliver\nover the takman, like a servant, like a treasure!\n\n{06020}\n\n## VI, 20. Charm against takman (fever).\n\n1\\. As if from this Agni (fire), that burns and flashes, (the takman) comes.\nLet him then, too, as a babbling drunkard, pass away! Let him, the impious\none, search out some other person, not ourselves! Reverence be to the takman\nwith the burning weapon!  \n2\\. Reverence be to Rudra, reverence to the takman, reverence to the luminous\nking Varuna! Reverence to heaven, reverence to earth, reverence to the plants!  \n3\\. To thee here, that burnest through, and turnest all bodies yellow, to the\nred, to the brown, to the takman produced by the forest, do I render\nobeisance.\n\n{01025}\n\n## I, 25. Charm against takman (fever).\n\n1\\. When Agni, having entered the waters, burned, where the (gods) who uphold\nthe order (of the universe) rendered homage (to Agni), there, they say, is thy\norigin on high: do thou feel for us, and spare us, O takman!  \n2\\. Whether thou art flame, whether thou art heat, or whether from licking\nchips (of wood) thou bast arisen, Hrudu by name art thou, O god of the yellow:\ndo thou feel for us, and spare us, O takman!  \n3\\. Whether thou art burning, whether thou art scorching, or whether thou art\nthe son of king Varuna, Hrudu by name art thou, O god of the yellow: do thou\nfeel for us, and spare us, O takman!  \n4\\. To the cold takman, and to the deliriously hot, the glowing, do I render\nhomage. To hirn that returns on the morrow, to him that returns for two\n(successive) days, to the takman that returns on the third day, homage shall\nbe!\n\n{07116}\n\n## VII, 116. Charm against takman (fever).\n\n1\\. Homage (be) to the deliriously hot, the shaking, exciting, impetuous\n(takman)! Homage to the cold (takman), to him that in the past fulfilled\ndesires!  \n2\\. May (the takman) that returns on the morrow, he that returns on two\n(successive) days, the impious one, pass into this frog!\n\n{05004}\n\n## V, 4. Prayer to the kushtha-plant to destroy takman (fever).\n\n1\\. Thou that art born upon the mountains, as the most potent of plants, come\nhither, O kushtha, destroyer of the takman, to drive out from here the takman!  \n2\\. To thee (that growest) upon the mountain, the brooding-place of the eagle,\n(and) art sprung from Himavant, they come with treasures, having heard (thy\nfame). For they know (thee to be) the destroyer of the takman.  \n3\\. The asvattha-tree is the seat of the gods in the third heaven from here.\nThere the gods procured the kushtha, the visible manifestation of amrita\n(ambrosia).  \n4\\. A golden ship with golden tackle moved upon the heavens. There the gods\nprocured the kushtha, the flower of amrita (ambrosia).  \n5\\. The paths were golden, and golden were the oars; golden were the ships,\nupon which they carried forth the kushtha hither (to the mountain).  \n6\\. This person here, O kushtha, restore for me, and cure him! Render him free\nfrom sickness for me!  \n7\\. Thou art born of the gods, thou art Soma's good friend. Be thou propitious\nto my in-breathing and my out-breathing, and to this eye of mine!  \n8\\. Sprung in the north from the Himavant (mountains), thou art brought to the\npeople in the east. There the most stiperior varieties of the kushtha were\napportioned.  \n9\\. 'Superior,' O kushtha, is thy name; 'superior' is the name of thy father.\nDo thou drive out all disease, and render the takman devoid of strength!  \n10\\. Pain in the head, affliction in the eye, and ailment of the body, all\nthat shall the kushtha heal-a divinely powerful (remedy), forsooth!\n\n{19039}\n\n## XIX, 39. Prayer to the kushtha-plant to destroy takman (fever), and other\nailments.\n\n1\\. May the protecting god kushtha come hither from the Himavant: destroy thou\nevery takman, and all female spooks!  \n2\\. Three names hast thou, O kushtha, (namely: kushtha), na-gha-mara\n('forsooth-no-death'), and na-gha-risha ('forsooth-no-harm'). Verily no harm\nshall suffer (na gha . . . rishat) this person here, for whom I bespeak thee\nmorn and eve, aye the (entire) day!  \n3\\. Thy mother's name is givala ('quickening'), thy father's name is givanta\n('living'). Verily no harm shall suffer this person here, for whom I bespeak\nthee morn and eve, aye the entire day!  \n4\\. Thou art the most superior of the plants, as a steer among cattle, as the\ntiger among beasts of prey. Verily no harm shall stiffer this person here, for\nwhom I bespeak thee morn and eve, aye the entire day!  \n5\\. Thrice begotten by the Sambu Angiras, thrice by the \xc3\x82dityas, and thrice by\nall the gods, this kushtha, a universal remedy, stands together with soma.\nDestroy thou every takman, and all female spooks!  \n6\\. The asvattha-tree is the seat of the gods in the third heaven from here.\nThere came to sight the amrita (ambrosia), there the kushtha-plant was born.  \n7\\. A golden ship with golden tackle moved upon the heavens. There came to\nsight the amrita, there the kushtha-plant was born.  \n8\\. On the spot where the ship glided down, on the peak of the Himavant, there\ncame to sight the ambrosia, there the kushtha-plant was born. This kushtha, a\nuniversal remedy, stands together with soma. Destroy thou every takman, and\nall female spooks!  \n9\\. (We know) thee whom Ikshvaku knew of yore, whom the women, fond of\nkushtha, knew, whom Vayasa and Matsya knew: therefore art thou a universal\nremedy.  \n10\\. The takman that returns on each third day, the one that cominues without\nintermission, and the yearly one, ao thou, (O plant) of unremitting strength,\ndrive away down below!\n\n{01012}\n\n## I, 12. Prayer to lightning, conceived as the cause of fever, headache, and\ncough.\n\n1\\. The first red bull, born of the (cloud-)womb, born of wind and clouds,\ncomes on thundering with rain. May he, that cleaving moves straight on, spare\nour bodies; he who, a single force, has passed through threefold!  \n2\\. Bowing down to thee that fastenest thyself with heat upon every limb, we\nwould reverence thee with oblations; we would reverence with oblations the\ncrooks and hooks of thee that hast, as a seizer, seized the limbs of this\nperson.  \n3\\. Free him from headache and also from cough, (produced by the lightning)\nthat has entered his every joint! May the flashing (lightning), that is born\nof the cloud, and born of the wind, strike the trees and the mountains!  \n4\\. Comfort be to my upper limb, comfort be to my nether; comfort be to my\nfour members, comfort to my entire body!\n\n{01022}\n\n## I, 22. Charm against jaundice and related diseases.\n\n1\\. Up to the sun shall go thy heart-ache and thy jaundice: in the colour of\nthe red bull do we eovelop thee!  \n2\\. We envelop thee in red tints, unto long life. May this person go\nunscathed, and be free of vellow colour!  \n3\\. The cows whose divinity is Rohini, they who, moreover, axe (themselves)\nred (rohinin)-(in their) every form and every strength we do envelop thee.  \n4\\. Into the parrots, into the ropanakas (thrush) do we put thy jaundice, and,\nfurthermore, into the haridravas (yellow wagtail) do we put thy jaundice.\n\n{06014}\n\n## VI, 14. Charm against the disease balasa.\n\n1\\. The internal disease that has set in, that crumbles the bones, and\ncrumbles the joints, every balasa do thou drive out, that which is in the\nlimbs, and in the joints!  \n2\\. The balasa of him that is afflicted with balasa do I remove, as one gelds\na lusty animal. Its connection do I cut off as the root of a pumpkin.  \n3\\. Fly forth from here, O balasa, as a swift foal (after the mare). And even,\nas the reed in every year, pass away without slaying men!\n\n{04105}\n\n## VI, 105. Charm against cough.\n\n1\\. As the-soul with the soul's desires swiftly to a distance flies, thus do\nthou, O cough, fly forth along the soul's course of flight!  \n2\\. As a well-sharpened arrow swiftly to a distance flies, thus do thou, O\ncough, fly forth along the expanse of the earth!  \n3\\. As the rays of the sun swiftly to a distance fly, thus do thou, O cough,\nfly forth along the flood of the sea!\n\n{01002}\n\n## I, 2. Charm against excessive discharges from the body.\n\n1\\. We know the father of the arrow, Parg-anya, who furnishes bountiful fluid,\nand well do we know his mother, Prithivi (earth), the multiform!  \n2\\. O bowstring, turn aside from us, turn my body into stone! Do thou firmly\nhold very far away the hostile powers and the haters!  \n3\\. When the bowstring, embracing the wood (of the bow), greets with a whiz\nthe eaoer arrow, do thou, O Indra, ward off from us the piercing missile!  \n4\\. As the point (of the arrow) stands in the way of heaven and earth, thus\nmay the mu\xc3\xb1ga-grass unfailingly stand in the way of sickness and (excessive)\ndischarge!\n\n{02003}\n\n## II, 3. Charm against excessive discharges from the body, undertaken with\nspring-water.\n\n1\\. The spring-water yonder which runs down upon the mountain, that do I\nrender healing for thee, in order that thou mayest contain a potent remedy.  \n2\\. Then surely, yea quite surely, of the hundred remedies contained in thee,\nthou art the most superior in checking discharges and removing pain.  \n3\\. Deep down do the Asuras bury this great healer of wounds: that is the cure\nfor discharges, and thal hath removed disease.  \n4\\. The ants bring the remedy from the sea: that is the cure for discharges,\nand that hath quieted disease.  \n5\\. This great healer of wounds has been gotten out of the earth: that is the\ncure for discharges, and  \nthat hath removed disease.  \n6\\. May the waters afford us welfare, may the herbs be propitious to us I\nIndra's bolt shall beat off the Rakshas, far (from us) shall fly the arrows\ncast by the Rakshas!\n\n{06044}\n\n## VI, 44.

Of the hundred remedies which thou hast, of the thousand that have been\ncollected, this is the most excellent cure for discharges, the best remover of\ndisease.  \n3\\. Thou art the urine of Rudra, the navel of amrita (ambrosia). Thy name,\nforsooth, is vishanaka, (thou art) arisen from the foundation of the Fathers,\na remover of diseases produced by the winds (of the body).\n\n{01003}\n\n## I, 3. Charm against constipation and retention of urine.\n\n1\\. We know the father of the arrow, Parganya, of hundredfold power.

Relaxed is the opening of thy bladder like the ocean, the reservoir of\nwater--thus let thy urine be released, out completely, with the sound bal!  \n9\\.

Charm against internal pain (colic), due to the missiles of Rudra.\n\n1\\. The arrow that Rudra did cast upon thee, into (thy) limbs, and into thy\nheart, this here do we now draw out away from thee.  \n2\\. From the hundred arteries which are distributed along thy limbs, from all\nof these do we exorcise forth the poisons.  \n3\\. Adoration be to thee, O Rudra, as thou casteth (thy arrow); adoration to\nthe (arrow) when it has been placed upon (the bow); adoration to it as it is\nbeing hurled; adoration to it when it has fallen down!\n\n{01010}\n\n## I, 10. Charm against dropsy.\n\n1\\. This Asura rules over the gods; the commands of Varuna, the ruler, surely\ncome true. From this (trouble), from the wrath of the mighty (Varuna), do I,\nexcelling in my incantation, lead out this man.  \n2\\. Reverence, O king Varuna, be to thy wrath, for all falsehood, O mighty\none, clost thou discover. A thousand others together do I make over to thee:\nthis thy (man) shall live a hundred autumns!  \n3\\. From the untruth which thou hast spoken, the abundant wrong, with thy\ntongue--from king, Varuna I release thee, whose laws do not fail.  \n4\\.

Lift from us, O Varuna, the uppermost fetter, take down the nethermost,\nloosen the middlemost! Then shall we, O \xc3\x82ditya, in thy law, exempt from guilt,\nlive in freedom!  \n4\\. Loosen from us, O Varuna, all fetters, the uppermost, the nethermost, and\nthose imposed by Varuna! Evil dreams, and misfortune drive away from us: then\nmay we go to the world of the pious!\n\n{06024}\n\n## VI, 24. Dropsy, heart-disease, and kindred maladies cured by flowing water.\n\n1\\. From the Himavant (mountains) they flow forth, in the Sindhu (Indus),\nforsooth, is their assembling-place: may the waters, indeed, grant me that\ncure for heart-ache!  \n2\\.

May Agni together with the waters be auspicious to thee, may Soma together\nwith the plants be auspicious.

Guiltless do I render thee through my charm; may heaven and earth both\nbe propitious to thee!  \nMay the wind in the atmosphere auspiciously bestow upon thee strength, may the\nfour quarters of the heaven be auspicious to thee. Thus from kshetriya, from\nNirriti &c.  \n4\\. These four goddesses, the directions of space, the consorts of the wind,\nthe sun surveys. Thus from kshetriya, from Nirriti &c.  \n5\\.

Desirous do I, O Agni, with firewood and ghee offer oblations (to thee),\nfor success and strength; according to ability praising (thee) with my prayer,\ndo I sing this divine song, that I may gain a hundredfold!  \n4\\. (Pardon, O Agni, this sin of ours [incurred upon] the far road which we\nhave travelled!) May our purchases and our sales be successful for us; may\nwhat I get in barter render me a gainer! May ye two (Indra and Agni) in accord\ntake pleasure in this oblation! May our transactions and the accruing gain be\nauspicious to us!  \n5\\. The wealth with which I go to purchase, desiring, ye gods, to gain wealth\nthrough wealth, may that grow more, not less! Drive away, O Agni, in return\nfor the oblation, the gods who shut off gain!  \n6\\. The wealth with which I go to purchase, desiring, ye gods, to gain wealth\nthrough wealth, may Indra, Pragapati, Savitar, Soma, Agni, place lustre into\nit for me!  \n7\\. We praise with reverence thee, O priest (Agni) Vaisvdnara. Do thou over\nour children, selves, cattle, and life's breath watch!  \n8\\. Daily, never failing, shall we bring (oblations to thee), O Gatavedas, (as\nif fodder) to a horse standing (in the stable).

Together with the atmosphere, O thou who art full of strength, protect the\nwhite (karki) calf, O thou swift steed (the sun)! Here are many drops (of\nghee) for thee; come hither! May this white calf (karki) of thine, may thy\nmind, be here!  \n7\\. Together with the atmosphere, O thou who art full of strength, protect the\nwhite (karki) calf, O thou swift steed (the sun)!

Whether they be alert, or not alert, the fortune of (these) folks,\nunresisting, shall assemble from all sides, the gain (collect) within my\nhands!  \n3\\. I invoke with reverence Agni, who has his own riches; here attached he\nshall beap up gain for us! I procure (wealth) for myself, as if with chariots\nthat win the race. May I accomplish auspiciously the song of praise to the\nMaruts!  \n4\\. May we by thy aid conquer the (adversary s) troop; help us (to obtain) our\nshare in every contest! Make for us, O Indra, a good and ample road; crush, O\nMaghavan, the lusty power of our enemies!  \n5\\. I have conquered and cleaned thee out (?); I have also gained thy reserve.\nAs the wolf plucks to pieces the sheep, thus do I pluck thy winnings.  \n6\\. Even the strong hand the bold player conquers, as the skilled gambler\nheaps up his winnings at the proper time. Upon him that loves the game (the\ngod), and does not spare his money, (the game, the god) verily bestows the\ndelights of wealth.  \n7\\. Through (the possession of) cattle we all would suppress (our) wretched\npoverty, or with grain our hunger, O thou oft implored (god)! May we foremost\namong rulers, unharmed, gain wealth by our cunning devices!  \n8\\. Gain is deposited in my right hand, victory in my left. Let me become a\nconqueror of cattle, horses, wealth, and gold!  \n9\\. O dice, yield play, profitable as a cow that is rich in milk!

Charm against serpents, invoking the horse of Pedu that slays\nserpents.\n\n1\\. To Indra belongs the first chariot, to the gods the second chariot, to\nVaruna, forsooth, the third. The serpents' chariot is the last: it shall hit a\npost, and come to grief!  \n2\\. The young darbha-grass burns (the serpents?), the tail of the horse, the\ntail of the shaggy one, the seat of the wagon (burns the serpents?).  \n3\\. Strike down, O white (horse), with thy forefoot and thy hind-foot! As\ntimber floating in water, the poison of the serpents, the fierce fluid, is\ndevoid of strength.  \n4\\. Neighing loudly he dived down, and, again diving up, said: 'As timber\nfloating in water, the poison of the serpents, the fierce fluid, is devoid of\nstrength.'  \n5\\. The horse of Pedu slays the kasarnila, the horse of Pedu slays the white\n(serpent), and also the black. The horse of Pedu cleaves the head of the\nratharvi, the adder.  \n6\\. O horse of Pedu, go thou first: we come after thee! Thou shalt cast out\nthe serpents from the road upon which we come!  \n7\\. Here the horse of Pedu was born; from here is his departure. Here are the\ntracks of the serpent-killing, powerful steed!  \n8\\. May the closed (serpent's jaw) not snap open, may the open one not close!\nThe two serpents in this field, man and wife, they are both bereft of\nstrength.  \n9\\. Without strength here are the serpents, those that are near, and those\nthat are far. With a club do I slay the vriskika (scorpion), with a staff the\nserpent that has approached.  \n10\\. Here is the remedy for both the aghasva and the svaga! Indra (and) Pedu's\nhorse have put to naught the evil-planning (aghayantam) serpent.  \n11\\. The horse of Pedu do we remember, the strong, with strong footing: behind\nhe, staring forth, these adders.  \n12\\. Deprived are they of life's spirit, deprived of poison, slain by Indra\nwith his bolt. Indra hath slain them: we have slain them.  \n13\\. Slain are they that are striped across, crushed are the adders! Slay thou\nthe one that produces a hood, (slay) the white and the black in the darbha-\ngrass!  \n14\\. The maiden of the Kirata-tribe, the little one digs up the remedy, with\ngolden spades, on the mountain's back.  \n15\\. Hither has come a youthful physician: he slays the speckled (serpent), is\nirresistible. He, forsooth, crushes the svaga and the vriskika both.  \n16\\. Indra did set at naught for me the serpent, (and so did) Mitra and\nVaruna, Vata and Parganya both.  \n17\\. Indra did set at naught for me the serpent, the adder, male and female,\nthe svaga, (the serpent) that is striped across, the kasarnila, and the\ndasonasi.  \n18\\. Indra slew thy first ancestor, O serpent, and since they are crushed,\nwhat strength, forsooth, can be theirs?  \n19\\. I have gathered up their heads, as the fisherman the karvara (fish). I\nhave gone off into the river's midst, and washed out the serpent's poison.  \n20\\. The poison of all serpents the rivers shall carry off! Slain are they\nthat are striped across, crushed are the adders!  \n21\\. As skilfully I cull the fibre of the plants, as I guide the mares,\n(thus), O serpent, shall thy poison go away!  \n22\\. The poison that is in the fire, in the sun, in the earth, and in the\nplants, the kanda-poison, the kanaknaka, thy poison shall go forth, and come!  \n23\\. The serpents that are sprung from the fire, that are sprung from the\nplants, that are sprung from the water, and originate from the lightning; they\nfrom whom great brood has sprung in many ways, those serpents do we revere\nwith obeisance.  \n24\\. Thou art, (O plant), a maiden, Taudi by name.; Ghritaki, forsooth, is thy\nname. Underfoot is thy place: I take in hand what destroys the poison.  \n25\\. From every limb make the poison start; shut it out from the heart! Now\nthe force that is in thy poison shall go down below!  \n26\\. The poison has gone to a distance: he has shut it out; he has fused the\npoison with poison. Agni has put away the poison of the serpent, Soma has led\nit out. The poison has gone back to the biter. The serpent is dead!\n\n{11002}\n\n## XI, 2. Prayer to Bhava and Sarva for protection from dangers.\n\n1\\.

To thy (charge) have been assigned these five (kinds\nof) cattle: cows, horses, men, goats and sheep.  \n10\\. Thine, O strong god (ugra), are the four regions, thine the sky, thine\nthe earth, and thine this broad atmosphere; thine is this all that has a\nspirit and has breath upon the earth.  \n11\\. Thine is this broad, treasure-holding receptacle within which all worlds\nare contained. Do thou spare us, O lord of cattle: reverence be to thee! Far\nfrom us shall go the jackals, evil omens, dogs; far shall go (the mourning\nwomen) who bewail rnisfortune with dishevelled hair!  \n12\\. Thou, O crested (god), carriest in (thy hand), that smites thousands, a\nyellow, golden bow that slays hundreds; Rudra's arrow, the missile of the\ngods, flies abroad: reverence be to it, in whatever direction from here (it\nflies)!  \n13\\. The adversary who lurks and seeks to overcome thee, O Rudra, upon him\nthou dost fasten thyself from behind, as (the hunter) that follows the trail\nof a wounded (animal).  \n14\\. Bhava and Rudra, united and concordant, both strong (ugrau), ye advance\nto deeds of heroism: reverence be to both of them, in whatever direction (they\nare) from here!  \n15\\. Reverence be to thee coming, reverence to thee going; reverence, O Rudra,\nbe to thee standing, and reverence, also, to thee sitting!  \n16\\. Reverence in the evening, reverence in the morning, reverence by\nnight,reverence byday! I have offered reverence to Bhava and to Sarva, both.  \n17\\. Let us not with our tongue offend Rudra, who rushes on, thousand-eyed,\noverseeing all, who hurls (his shafts) forward, who is manifoldly wise!  \n18\\. We approach first the (god) that has dark horses, is black, sable,\ndestructive, terrible, who casts down the car of Kesin: reverence be to him!  \n19\\. Do not hurl at us thy club, thy divine bolt; be not incensed at us, O\nlord of cattle! Shake over some other than us the celestial branch!  \n20\\. Injure us not, interpose for us, spare us, be not angry with us! Let us\nnot contend with thee!  \n21\\. Do not covet our cattle, our men, our goats and sheep! Bend thy course\nelsewhere, O strong god (ugra), slay the offspring of the blasphemers!  \n22\\. He whose missile, fever and cough, assails the single (victim), as the\nsnorting of a stallion, who snatches away (his victims) one by one, to him be\nreverence!  \n23\\. He who dwells fixed in the atmosphere, smiting the blasphemers of the god\nthat do not sacrifice, to him be reverence with ten sakvari-stanzas!  \n24\\. For thee the wild beasts of the forest have been placed in the forest:\nflamingoes, eagles, birds of prey, and fowls. Thy spirit, O lord of cattle, is\nwithin the waters, to strengthen thee the heavenly waters flow.  \n25\\. The dolphins, great serpents (boas), purikayas (water-animals), sea-\nmonsters, fishes, ragasas at which thou shootest-there exists for thee, O\nBhava, no distance, and no barrier. At a glance thou lookest around the entire\nearth; from the eastern thou slayest in the northern ocean.  \n26\\. Do not, O Rudra, contaminate us with fever, or with poison, or with\nheavenly fire: cause this lightning to descend elsewhere than upon us!  \n27\\. Bhava rules the sky, Bhava rules the earth; Bhava has filled the broad:\natmosphere. Reverence be to him in whatever direction from here (he abides)!  \n28\\.

Propitious he shall be to our cattle and  \nour domestics; may not, ye gods, the pigeon here do harm to us!\n\n{06029}\n\n## VI, 29. Charm against ominous pigeons and owls.\n\n1\\. Upon those persons yonder the winged missile shall fall! If the owl\nshrieks, futile shall this be, or if the pigeon takes his steps upon the fire!  \n2\\. To thy two messengers, O Nirriti, who come here, despatched or not\ndespatched, to our house, to the pigeon and to the owl, this shall be no place\nto step upon!  \n3\\. He shall not fly hither to slaughter (our) men; to keep (our) men sound he\nshall settle here! Charm .him very far away unto a distant region, that\n(people) shall behold you (i.e. him) in Yama's house devoid of strength, that\nthey shall behold you bereft of power!\n\n{07064}\n\n## VII, 64. Expiation when one is defiled by a black bird of omen.\n\n1\\. What this black bird flying forth towards (me) has dropped here--may the\nwaters protect me from all that misfortune and evil!  \n2\\. What this black bird has brushed here with thy mouth, O Nirtiti (goddess\nof misfortune)-may Agni Garhapatya (the god of the household fire) free me\nfrom this sin!\n\n{06046}\n\n## VI, 46. Exorcism of evil dreams.\n\n1\\. Thou who art neither alive nor dead, the immortal child of the gods art\nthou, O Sleep! Varunani is thy mother, Yama (death) thy father, Araru is thy\nname.  \n2\\. We know, O Sleep, thy birth, thou art the son of the divine women-folk,\nthe instrument of Yama (death)! Thou art the ender, thou art death! Thus do we\nknow thee, O Sleep: do thou, O Sleep, protect us from evil dreams!  \n3\\. As one pays off a sixteenth, an eighth, or an (entire) debt, thus do we\ntransfer every evil dream upon our enemy.\n\n{07115}\n\n## VII, 115. Charm for the removal of evil characteristics, and the\nacquisition of auspicious ones.\n\n1\\. Fly forth from here, O evil mark, vanish from here, fly forth to yonder\nplace! Upon him that hates us do we fasten thee with a brazen hook.  \n2\\. The unsavoury mark which flying has alighted upon me, as a creeper upon a\ntree, that mayest thou put away from us, away from here, O golden-handed  \n(golden-rayed) Savitar (the sun), bestowing goods upon us!  \n3\\. Together with the body of the mortal, from his birth, one and a hundred\nmarks are born. Those that are most foul do we drive away from here; the\nauspicious ones, O Gatavedas (Agni), do thou hold fast for us!  \n4\\. These (marks) here I have separated, as cows scattered upon the heather.\nThe pure marks shall remain, the foul ones I have made to disappear!\n\n# IX.\n\n# PRAYERS AND IMPRECATIONS IN THE INTEREST OF THE BRAHMANS.\n\n{05018}\n\n## V, 18. Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.\n\n1\\. The gods, O king, did not give to thee this (Cow) to eat. Do not, O\nprince, seek to devour the cow of the Brahmana, which is unfit to be eaten!  \n2\\. The prince, beguiled by dice, the wretched one who has lost as a stake his\nown person, he may, perchance, eat the cow of the Brahmana, (thinking), 'let\nme live to-day (if) not to-morrow'!  \n3\\. Enveloped (is she) in her skin, as an adder with evil poison; do not, O\nprince, (eat the cow) of the Brahmana: sapless, unfit to be eaten, is that\ncow!  \n4\\. Away does (the Brahmana) take regal power, destroys vigour; like fire\nwhich has caught does he burn away everything. He that regards the Brahmana as\nfit food drinks of the poison of the taimata-serpent.  \n5\\. He who thinks him (the Brahman) mild, and slays him, he who reviles the\ngods, lusts after wealth, without thought, in his heart Indra kindles a fire;\nhim both heaven and earth hate while he lives.  \n6\\. The Brahmana must not be encroached upon, any more than fire, by him that\nregards his own body! For Soma is his (the Brahmana's) heir, Indra protects\nhim from hostile plots.  \n7\\. He swallows her (the cow), bristling with a hundred hooks, (but) is unable\nto digest her, he, the fool who, devouring the food of the Brahmans, thinks,\n'I am eating a luscious (morsel).'  \n8\\. (The Brahman's) tongue turns into a bow. string, his voice into the neck\nof an arrow; his windpipe, his teeth are bedaubed with holy fire: with these\nthe Brahman strikes those who revile the gods, by means of bows that have the\nstrength to reach the heart, discharged by the gods.  \n9\\. The Brahmanas have sharp arrows, are armed with missiles, the arrow whi ch\nthey hurl goes not in vain; pursuing him with their holy fire and their wrath,\neven from afar, do they pierce him.  \n10\\. They who ruled over a thousand, and were themselves ten hundred, the\nVaitahavya, when they devoured the cow of the Brahmana, perished.  \n11\\. The cow herself, when slaughtered, came down upon the Vaitahavyas. who\nhad roasted for themselves the last she-goat of Kesaraprabandha.  \n12\\. The one hundred and one persons whom the earth did cast off, because they\nhad injured the offspring of a Brahmana, were ruined irretrievably.  \n13\\. As a reviler of the gods does he live among mortals, having swallowed\npoison, he becomes more bone (than flesh). He that injureth a Brahmana, whose\nkin are the gods, does not reach heaven by the road of the Fathers.  \n14\\. Agni is called our guide, Soma our heir, Indra slays those who curse\n(us): that the strong (sages) know.  \n15\\. Like a poisoned arrow, O king, like -an adder, O lord of cattle, is the\nterrible arrow of the Brahmana: with that he smites those who revile (the\ngods).\n\n{05019}\n\n## V, 19. Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.\n\n1\\. Beyond measure they waxed strong, just fell short of touching the heavens.\nWhen they infringed upon Bhrigu they perished, the Sri\xc3\xb1gaya Vaitahavyas.  \n2\\. The persons who pierced Brihatsaman, the descendant of Angiras, the\nBrahmana--a ram with two rows of teeth, a sheep devoured their offspring.  \n3\\. They who spat upon the Brahmana, who desired tribute from him, they sit in\nthe middle of a pool of blood, chewing hair.  \n4\\. The cow of the Brahman, when roasted, as far as she reaches does she\ndestroy the lustre of the kingdom; no lusty hero is born (there).  \n5\\. A cruel (sacrilegious) deed is her slaughter, her meat, when eaten, is\nsapless; when her milk is drunk, that surely is accounted a crime against the\nFathers.  \n6\\. When the king, weening himself mighty, desires to destroy the Brahmana,\nthen royal power is dissipated, where the Brahmana is oppressed.  \n7\\. Becoming eight-footed, four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed, two-mouthed,\ntwo-tongued, she dispels the rule of the oppressor of the Brahman.  \n8\\. That (kingdom) surely she swamps, as water a leaking ship; misfortune\nstrikes that kingdom, in which they injure a Brahmana.  \n9\\. The trees chase away with the words: 'do not come within our shade,' him\nwho covets the wealth that belongs to a Brahmana, O Narada!  \n10\\. King Varuna pronounced this (to be) poison, prepared by the gods: no one\nwho has devoured the cow of a Brahmana retains the charge of a kingdom.  \n11\\. Those full nine and ninety whom the earth did cast off, because they had\ninjured the offspring of a Brahmana, were ruined irretrievably.  \n12\\. The kudi-plant (Christ's thorn) that wipes away the track (of death),\nwhich they fasten to the dead, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the\ngods did declare (to be) thy couch.  \n13\\. The tears which have rolled from (the eyes of) the oppressed (Brahman),\nas he laments, these very ones, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did assign\nto thee as thy share of water.  \n14\\. The water with which they bathe the dead, with which they moisten his\nbeard, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did assign to thee as\nthy share of water.  \n15\\. The rain of Mitra and Varuna does not moisten the oppressor of Brahmans;\nthe assembly is not complacent for him, he does not guide his friend according\nto his will.\n\n{05007}\n\n## V, 7. Prayer to appease Arati, the demon of grudge and avarice.\n\n1\\. Bring (wealth) to us, do not stand in our way, O Arati; do not keep from\nus the sacrificial reward as it is being taken (to us)! Adoration be to the\npower of grudge, the power of failure, adoration to Arati!  \n2\\. To thy advising minister, whom thou, Arati, didst make thy agent, do we\nmake obeisance. Do not bring failure to my wish!  \n3\\. May our wish, instilled by the gods, be fulfilled by day and night! We go\nin quest of Arati. Adoration be to Arati!  \n4\\. Sarasvati (speech), Anumati (favour), and Bhaga (fortune) we go to invoke.\nPleasant, honied, words I have spoken on the occasions when the gods were\ninvoked.  \n5\\. Him whom I implore with Vak Sarasvati (the goddess-of speech), the yoke-\nfellow of thought, faith shall find to-day, bestowed by the brown soma!  \n6\\. Neither our wish nor our speech do thou frustrate! May Indra and Agni both\nbring us wealth! Do ye all who to-day desire to make gifts to us gain favour\nwith Arati!  \n7\\. Go far away, failure! Thy missile do we avert. I know thee (to be)\noppressive and piercing, O Arati!  \n8\\. Thou dost even transform thyself into a naked woman, and attach thyself to\npeople in their sleep, frustrating, O Arati, the thought, and intention of\nman.  \n9\\. To her who, great, and of great dimension, did penetrate all the regions,\nto this golden-locked Nirriti (goddess of misfortune), I have rendered\nobeisance.  \n10\\. To the gold-complexioned, lovely one, who rests upon golden cushions, to\nthe great one, to that Arati who wears golden robes, I have rendered\nobeisance.\n\n{12004}\n\n## XII, 4. The necessity of giving away sterile cows to the Brahmans.\n\n1\\. 'I give,' he shall surely say,'the sterile cow to the begging Brahmans'--\nand they have noted her--that brings progeny and offspring!  \n2\\. With his offspring does he trade, of his cattle is he deprived, that\nrefuses to give the cow of the gods to the begging descendants of the Rishis.  \n3\\. Through (the gift of) a cow with broken horns his (cattle) breaks down,\nthrough a lame one he tumbles into a pit, through a mutilated one his house is\nburned, through a one-eyed one his property is given away.  \n4\\. Flow of blood attacks the cattle-owner from the spot where her dung is\ndeposited: this understanding there is about the vasa (the sterile cow); for\nthou (sterile cow) art said to be very difficult to deceive!  \n5\\. From the resting-place of her feet the (disease) called viklindu overtakes\n(the owner, or the cattle). Without sickness breaks down (the cattle) which\nshe sniffs upon with her nose.  \n6\\. He that pierces her ears is estranged from the gods. He thinks: 'I am\nmaking a mark (upon her),' (but) he diminishes his own property.  \n7\\. If any one for whatsoever purpose cuts her tail then do his colts die, and\nthe wolf tears his calves.  \n8\\. If a crow has injured her hair, as long as she is with her owner then do\nhis children die: decline overtakes them without (noticeable) sickness.  \n9\\. If the serving-maid sweeps together her dung, that bites as lye, there\narises from this sin disfigurement that passeth not away.  \n10\\. The sterile cow in her very birth is born for the gods and Brahmanas.\nHence to the Brahmans she is to be given: that, they say, guarantees the\nsecurity of one's own property.  \n11\\. For those that come requesting her the cow has been created by the gods.\nOppression of Brahmans it is called, if he keeps her for himself.  \n12\\. He that refuses to give the cow of the gods to the descendants of the\nRishis who ask for it, infringes upon the gods, and the wrath of the\nBrahmanas.  \n13\\. Though he derives benefit from this sterile cow, another (cow) then shall\nhe seek! When kept she injures (his) folk, if he refuses to give her after she\nhas been asked for!  \n14\\. The sterile cow is as a treasure deposited for die Brahmanas: they come\nhere for her, with whomsoever she is born.  \n15\\. The Brahmanas come here for their own, when they come for the sterile\ncow. The refusal of her is, as though he were oppressing them in other\nconcerns.  \nI& If she herds up to her third year, and no disease is discovered in her, and\nhe finds her to be a sterile cow, O Narada, then must he look for the\nBrahmanas.  \n17\\. If he denies that she is sterile, a treasure deposited for the gods, then\nBhava and Sarva, both, come upon him, and hurl their arrow upon him.  \n18\\. Though he does not perceive upon her either udder, or tits, yet both\nyield him milk, if he has prevailed upon himself to give away the sterile cow.  \n19\\. Hard to cheat, she oppresses him, if, when asked for, he refuses to give\nher. His desires are not fulfilled, if he aims to accomplish them without\ngiving her away.  \n20\\. The gods did ask for the sterile cow, making the Brahmana their\nmouthpiece. The man that does not give (her) enters into the wrath of all of\nthese.  \n21\\. Into the wrath of the cattle enters he that gives not the sterile cow to\nthe Brahmanas; if he, the mortal, appropriates the share deposited for the\ngods.  \n22\\. Even if a hundred other Brahmanas beg the owner for the sterile cow, yet\nthe gods did say anent her: 'The cow belongs to him that knoweth thus.'  \n23\\. He that refuses the sterile cow to him that knoweth thus, and gives her\nto others, difficult to dwell upon is for him the earth with her divinities.  \n24\\. The gods did beg the sterile cow of him wilh whom she was born at first.\nThat very one Narada recognised and drove forth in company with the gods.  \n25\\. The sterile cow renders childless, and poor in cattle, him that yet\nappropriates her, when she has been begged for by the Brahmanas.  \n26\\. For Agni and Soma, for Kama, for Mitra, and for Varuna, for these do the\nBrahmanas beg her: upon these he infringes, if he gl ves her not.  \n27\\. As long as the owner does not himself hear the stanzas referring to (the\ngiving away of) her, she may herd among his cattle; (only) if he has not heard\n(them) may she pass the night in his house.  \n28\\. He that has listened to the stanzas, yet has permitted her to herd among\nthe cattle, his life and prosperity the angry gods destroy.  \n29\\. The sterile cow, even when she rambles freely, is a treasure deposited\nfor the gods. Make evident thy true nature when thou desirest to go to thy\n(proper) stable!  \n30\\. She makes evident her nature when she desires to go to her (proper)\nstable. Then indeed the sterile cow puts it into the minds of the Brahmans to\nbeg (for her).  \n31\\. She evolves it in her mind, that (thought) reaches the gods. Then do the\nBrahmans come to beg for the sterile cow.  \n32\\. The call svadha befriends him with the Fathers, the sacrifice with the\ngods. Through the gift of the sterile cow the man of royal caste incurs not\nthe anger of (her), his mother.  \n33\\. The sterile cow is the mother of the man of royal caste: thus was it from\nthe beginning. It is said to be no (real) deprivation if she is given to the\nBrahmans.  \n34\\. As if he were to rob the ghee ladled up for Agni (the fire) from the\n(very) spoon, thus, if he gives not the sterile cow to the Brahmans, does he\ninfringe upon Agni.  \n35\\. The sterile cow has the purodasa (sacrificial cake) for her calf, she\nyields plentiful milk, helps in this world, and fulfils all wishes for him\nthat gives her (to the Brahmans).  \n36\\. The sterile cow fulfils all wishes in the kingdom of Yama for him that\ngives her. But they say that hell falls to the lot of him that withholds her,\nwhen she has been begged for.  \n37\\. The sterile cow, even if she should become fruitful, lives in anger at\nher owner: 'since he did regard me as sterile (without giving me to the\nBrahmans), he shall be bound in the fetters of death!'  \n38, He who thinks that the cow is sterile, and (yet) roasts her at home, even\nhis children qnd grandchildren Brihaspati causes to be importuned (for her).  \n39\\. Fiercely does the (supposed) sterile cow burn when she herds with the\ncattle, though she be a (fruitful) cow. She verily, too, milks poison for the\nowner that does not present her.  \n40\\. It pleases the cattle when she is given to the Brahmans; moreover, the\nsterile cow is pleased, when she is made an offering to the gods (Brahmans).  \n41\\. From the sterile cows which the gods, returning from the sacrifice,\ncreated, Narada picked out as (most) terrible the vilipti.  \n42\\. In reference to her the gods reflected: 'Is she a sterile cow, or not?'\nAnd Narada in reference to her said: 'Of sterile cows she is the most\nsterile!'  \n43\\. 'How many sterile cows (are there), O Narada, which thou knowest to be\nborn among men?' About these do I ask thee, that knowest: 'Of which may the\nnon-Brahmana not eat?'  \n44\\. Of the vilipti, of her that has born a sterile cow, and of the sterile\ncow (herself), the non-Brahmana, that hopes for prosperity, shall not eat!  \n45\\. Reverence be to thee, O Narada, that knowest thoroughly which sterile cow\nis the most terrible, by withholding which (from the Brahmans) destruction\nis.incurred.  \n46\\. The vilipti, O Brihaspati, her that has, begotten a sterile cow, and the\nsterile cow (herself), the non-Brahmana, that hopes for prosperity, shall not\neat!  \n47\\. Three kinds, forsooth, of sterile cows are there: the vilipti, she that\nhas begotten a sterile cow, and the sterile cow (herself). These he shall give\nto the Brahmans; (then) does he not estrange himself from Pragapati.  \n48\\. 'This is your oblation, O Brahmanas,' thus shall he reflect, if he is\nsupplicated, if they ask him for the sterile cow, terrible in the house of him\nthat refuses to give her.  \n49\\. The gods animadverted in reference to Bheda and the sterile cow, angry\nbecause he had not given her, in these verses-and therefore he (Bheda)\nperished.  \n50\\. Bheda did not present the sterile cow, though requested by Indra: for\nthis sin the gods crushed him in battle.  \n51\\. The counsellors that advise the withholding (of the sterile cow), they,\nthe rogues, in their folly, conflict with the wrath of Indra.  \n52\\. They who lead the owner of cattle aside, then say to him: 'do not give,'\nin their folly they run into the missile hurled by Rudra.  \n53\\. And if he roasts the sterile cow at home, whether he makes a sacrifice of\nher, or not, he sins against the gods and Brahmanas, and as a cheat falls from\nheaven.\n\n{11001}\n\n## XI, 1. The preparation of the brahmaudana, the porridge given as a fee to\nthe Brahmans.\n\n1\\. O Agni, come into being! Aditi here in her throes, longing for sons, is\ncooking the porridge for the Brahmans, The seven Rishis, that did create the\nbeings, shall here churn thee, along with progeny!  \n2\\. Produce the smoke, ye lusty friends; unharmed by wiles go ye into the\ncontest! Here is the Agni (fire) who gains battles, and commands powerful\nwarriors, with whom the gods did conquer the demons.  \n3\\. O Agni, to a great heroic deed thou wast aroused, to cook the Brahman's\nporridge, O Gatavedas! The seven Rishis, that did create the beings, have\nproduced thee. Grant her (the wife) wealth together with undiminished heroes!  \n4\\. Burn, O Agni, after having been kindled by the firewood, bring skilfully\nhither the gods that are to be revered! Causing the oblation to cook for these\n(Brahmans), do thou raise this (sacrificer) to the highest firmament!  \n5\\. The, threefold share which was of yore assigned to you (belongs) to the\ngods, the (departed) Fathers, and to the mortals (the priests). Know your\nshares! I divide them for you: the (share) of the gods shall protect this\n(woman)!  \n6\\. O Agni, possessed of might, superior, thou dost without fail prevail! Bend\ndown to the ground our hateful rivals!--This measure, that is being measured,\nand has been measured, may constitute thy kin into (people) that render thee\ntribute!  \n7\\. Mayest thou together with thy kin be endowed with sap! Elevate her (the\nwife) to great heroism! Ascend on high to the base of the firmament, which\nthey call 'the world of brightness'!  \n8\\. This great goddess earth, kindly disposed, shall receive the (sacrificial)\nskin! Then may we go to the world of well-doing (heaven)!  \n9\\. Lay these two press-stones, well coupled, upon the skin; crush skilfully\nthe (soma-) shoots for the sacrificer! Crush down, (O earth), and beat down,\nthose who are hostile to her (the wife); lift up high, and elevate her\noffspring!  \n10\\. Take into thy hands, O man, the press-stones that work together: the gods\nthat are to be revered have come to thy sacrifice! Whatever three wishes thou\ndost choose, I shall here procure for thee unto fulfilment.  \n11\\. This, (O winnowing-basket), is thy purpose, and this thy nature: may\nAditi, mother of heroes, take hold of thee! Winnow out those who are hostile\nto this (woman); afford her wealth and undiminished heroes!  \n12\\. Do ye, (O grains), remain in the (winnowing-) basket, while (the wind)\nblows over you; be separated, ye who are fit for the sacrifice, from the\nchaff! May we in happiness be superior to all our equals! I bend down under\nour feet those that hate us.  \n13\\. Retire, O woman, and return promptly! The stable of the waters (water-\nvessel) has settled upon thee, that thou mayest carry it: of these (the\nwaters) thou shalt take such as are fit for sacrifice; having intelligently\ndivided them off, thou shalt leave the rest behind!  \n14\\. These bright women, (the waters), have come hither. Arise, thou woman,\nand gather strength! To thee, that art rendered by thy husband a true wife,\n(and) by thy children rich in offspring, the sacrifice has come: receive the\n(water-) vessel!  \n15\\. The share of food that belongs to you of yore has been set aside for you.\nInstructed by the Rishis bring thou (woman) hither this water! May this\nsacrifice win advancement for you, win prAection, win offspring for you; may\nit be mighty, win cattle, and heroes for you!  \n16\\. O Agni, the sacrificial pot has settled upon thee: do thou shining,\nbrightly glowing, heat it with thy glow! May the divine descendants of the\nRishis, assembled about their share (of the porridge), full of fervour, heat\nthis (pot) at the proper time!  \n17\\. Pure and clear may these sacrificial women, the waters bright, flow into\nthe pot! The), have given us abundant offspring and cattle. May he that cooks\nthe porridge go to the world of the pious (heaven)!  \n18\\. Purified by (our) prayer, and clarified by the ghee are the soma-shoots,\n(and) these sacrificial grains. Enter the water; may the pot receive you! When\nye have cookect this (porridge) go ye to the world of the pious (heaven)!  \n19\\. Spread out far unto great extent, with a thousand surfaces, in the world\nof the pious! Grandfathers, fathers, children, grandchildren--I am the\nfifteenth one that did cook thee.  \n20\\. The porridge has a thousand surfaces, a hundred streams, and is\nindestructible; it is the road of the gods, leads to heaven. Yonder (enemies)\ndo I place upon thee: injure them and their offspring; (but) to me that brings\ngifts thou shalt be merciful!  \n21\\. Step upon the altar (vedi); make this woman thrive in her progeny; repel\nthe demons.; advance her! May we in happiness be superior to all our equals! I\nbend down under our feet all those that hate us.  \n22\\. Turn towards her with cattle, (thou pot), face towards her, together with\nthe divine powers! Neither curses nor hostile magic shall reach thee; rule in\nthy dwelling free from disease!  \n23\\. Properly built, placed with care, this altar (vedi) has been arranged of\nyore for the Brahmans porridge. Put it, O woman, upon the purified amsadhrl;\nplace there the porridge for the divine (Brahmanas)!  \n24\\. May this sacrificial ladle (sruk), the second hand of Aditi, which the\nseven Rishis, the creators of the beings, did fashion, may this spoon, knowing\nthe limbs of the porridge, heap it upon the altar!  \n25\\. The divine (Brahmanas) shall sit down to thee, the cooked saerfice: do\nthou again descending from the fire, approach them! Clarified by soma settle\nin the belly of the Brahmanas; the descendants of the Rishis who eat thee\nshall not take harm!  \n26\\. O king Soma, infuse harmony into the good Brahmanas who shall sit about\nthee! Eagerly do I invite to the porridge the Rishis, descended from Rishis,\nthat are born of religious fervour, and gladly obey the call.  \n27\\. These pure and clear sacrificial women (the waters) I put into the hands\nof the Brahmanas severally. With whatever wish I pour this upon you, may\nIndra. accompanied by the Maruts grant this to me!  \n28\\. This gold is my immortal light, this ripe fruit of the field is my wish-\ngranting cow. This treasure I present to the Brahmanas: I prepare for myself a\nroad that leads. to the Fathers in the heavens.  \n29\\. Scatter the spelt into Agni Gatavedas (the fire), sweep away to a far\ndistance the chaff! This (chaff) we have heard, is the share of the ruler of\nthe house (Agni), and we know, too, what belonos to Nirriti (destruction) as\nher share.  \n30\\. Note, (O porridge), him that takes pains, and cooks and presses the soma;\nlift him up to the heavenly road, upon which, after he has reached the fullest\nage, he shall ascend to the highest firmament, the supreme heavens!  \n31\\. Anoint (with ghee), O adhvaryu (priest), the surface of this sustaining\n(porridge), make skilfully a place for the melted butter; with ghee do thou\nanoint all its limbs! I prepare for myself a road that leads to the Fathers in\nthe heavens.  \n32\\. O sustaining (porridge), cast destruction and strife among such as are\nsitting about thee, and are not Brahmanas! (But) the descendants of the\n-Rishis, that eat thee, being full of substance, spreading forth, shall not\ntake harm!  \n33\\. To the descendants of the Rishis I make thee over, O porridge; those who\nare not descended from Rishis have no share in it! May Agni as my guardian,\nmay all the Maruts, and all the gods watch over the cooked food!  \n34\\. Thee (the porridge) that milkest the sacrifice, art evermore abundant,\nthe male milch-cow, the seat of wealth, we beseech for immortality of off-\nspring and long life with abundance of wealth.  \n35\\. Thou art a lusty male, penetratest heaven: go thou to the Rishis,\ndescended from Rishis! Dwell in the world of the pious: there is a well-\nprepared (place) for us two!  \n36\\. Pack thyself up, go forth! O Agni, prepare the roads, that lead to the\ngods! By these: well-prepared (roads) may we reach the sacrifice, standing\nupon the firmament (that shines) with seven rays!  \n37\\. With the light with which the gods, having cooked the porridge for the\nBramanas, ascended to heaven, to the world of the pious, with that would we go\nto the world of the pious, ascending to the light, to the highest firmament!\n\n{07003}\n\n## XII, 3. The preparation of the brahmaudana, the porridge given as a fee to\nthe Brahmans.\n\n1\\. (Thyself) a male, step thou upon the hide of the male (steer): go, call\nthither all that is dear to thee! At whatever age ye two formerly did first\nunite (in marriage), may that age be your common lot in Yama's kingdom!  \n2\\. Your sight shall be as clear (as formerly), your strength as abundant,\nyour lustre as great, your vitality as manifold! When Agni, the (funeral-)\npyre, fastens himself upon the corpse, then as a pair ye.shall rise from the\n(cooked) porridge!  \n3\\. Come ye together in this world, upon the road to the gods, and in Yama's\nrealms! By purifications purified call ye together the offspring that has\nsprung from you!  \n4\\. Around the water united, sit ye down, O children; around this living\n(father) and the waters that refresh the living! Partake of these (waters),\nand of that porridge which the mother of you two cooks, and which is called\namrita (ambrosia)!  \n5\\. The porridge which the father of you two, and which the mother cooks, unto\nfreedom from defilement and foulness of speech, that porridge with a hundred\nstreams (of ghee), leading to heaven, has penetrated with might both the\nhemispheres of the world.  \n6\\. In that one of the two hemispheres and the two heavenly worlds, conquered\nby the pious, which especially abounds in light, and is rich in honey, in that\ndo ye in the fulness of time come together with your children!  \n7\\. Keep ever on in an easterly direction: this is the region that the\nfaithful cling to! When your cooked porridge has been prepared on the fire,\nhold together, O man and wife, that ye may guard it!  \n8\\. When ye shall have reached the southerly direction, turn ye to this\nvessel! In that Yama, associated with the fathers, shall give abundant\nprotection to your cooked porridge!  \n9\\. This westerly direction is especially favoured: in it Soma is ruler and\nconsoler. To this hold, attach yourselves to the pious: then as a pair ye\nshall rise from the cooked porridge!  \n10\\. The northerly direction shall make our realm the very uppermost, in\noffspring, uppermost! The purusha is the metre pahkti: with all (our kin),\nendowed with all their limbs, may we be united!  \n11\\. This 'firm' direction (nadir) is Virag (brilliancy): reverence be to her;\nmay she be kind to my children and to me! Mayest thou, O goddess Aditi, who\nboldest all treasures, as an alert guardian guard the cooked porridge!  \n12\\. As a father his children do thou, (O earth), embrace us; may gentle winds\nblow upon us here on earth! Then the porridge which the two divinities (the\nsacrificer and his wife) are here preparing for us shall take note of our\nreligious fer~our and our truth!  \n13\\. Whatever the black bird, that has come hither stealthily, has touched of\nthat ahich has stuck to the rim, or whatever the wet-banded slavegirl does\npollute-may ye, O waters, purify (that) mortar and pestle!  \n14\\. May this sturdy press-stone, with broad bottom, purified by the\npurifiers, beat away the Rakshas! Settle upon the skin, afford firm\nprotection; may man and wife not come to grief in their children!  \n15\\. The (pestle of) wood has come to us together with the gods: it drives\naway the Rakshas and Pisakas. Up it shall rise, shall let its voice resound  \nthrough it let us conquer all the worlds!  \n16\\. The cattle clothed itself in sevenfold strength, those among them that\nare sleek and those that are poor. The thirty-three gods attend them mayest\nthou, (O cattle), guide us to the heavenly world!  \n17\\. To the bright world of heaven thou shalt lead us; (there) let us be\nunited with wife and children! I take her hand, may she follow me there;\nneither Nirriti (destruction), nor Arati (grudge), shall gain mastery over us!  \n18\\. May we get past the evil Grahi (seizure)! Casting aside darkness do thou,\n(O pestle), let thy lovely voice resound; do not, O wooden tool, when raised,\ndo injury; do not mutilate the grain devoted to the gods!  \n19\\. All-embracing, about to be covered with ghee, enter, (O pot), as a co-\ndweller this space!--Take hold of the winnowing-basket, that has been grown by\nthe rain: the spelt and the chaff it shall sift out!  \n20\\. Three regions are constructed after the pattern of the Brahmana: yonder\nheaven, the earth, and the atmosphere.--Take the (soma-) shoots, and hold one\nanother, (O man and wife)! They (the shoots) shall swell (with moisture), and\nagain go back into the winnowing-basket!  \n21\\. Of manifold variegated colours are the animals, one colour hast thou, (O\nporridge), when successfully prepared.--Push these (soma-) Shoots upon this\nred skin; the press-stone shall purify them as the washer-man his clothes!  \n22\\. Thee, the (pot of) earth, I place upon the earth: your substance is the\nsame, though thine, (O pot), is modified. Even though a blow has cracked or\nscratched thee, do not therefore burst: with this verse do I cover that up!  \n23\\. Gently as a mother embrace the son: I unite thee, (pot of) earth, with\nthe earth! Mayest thou, the hollow pot, not totter upon the altar, when thou\nart pressed by the tools of sacrifice and the ghee!  \n24\\. May Agni who cooks thee protect thee on the east, Indra with the Maruts\nprotect thee on the south! May Varuna on the west support thee upon thy\nfoundation, may Soma on the north hold thee together!  \n25\\. Purified by the purifiers, the (waters) flow pure from the clouds, they\nreach to the spaces of heaven, and of the earth. They are alive, refresh the\nlivino, and are firmly rooted: may Agni heat them, after they have been poured\ninto the vessel!  \n26\\. From heaven they come, into the earth they penetrate; from the earth they\npenetrate into the atmosphere. May they, now pure, yet purify themselves\nfurther; may they conduct us to the heavenly world!  \n27\\. Whether ye are over-abundant or just sufficient, ye are surely clear,\npure, and immortal: cook, ye waters, instructed by the husband and wife,\nobliging and helpful, the porridge!  \n28\\. Counted drops penetrate into the earth, commensurate with the breaths of\nlife and the plants. The uncounted golden (drops), that are poured into (the\nporridge), have, (themselves) pure, established complete purity.  \n29\\. The boiling waters rise and sputter, cast up foam and many bubbles.\nUnite, ye waters, with this grain, as a woman who beholds her husband in the\nproper season!  \n30\\. Stir up (the grains) as they settle at the bottom: let them mingle their\ninmost parts with the waters! The water here I have measured with cups;\nmeasured was the grain, so as to be according to these regulations.  \n31\\. Hand over the sickle, with haste bring promptly (the grass for the\nbarhis); without giving pain let them cut the plants at the joints! They whose\nkingdom Soma rules, the plants, shall not harbour anger against us!  \n32\\. Strew a new barhis for the porridge: pleasing to its heart, and lovely to\nits sight it shall be! Upon it the gods together with the goddesses shall\nenter; settle down to this (porridge) in proper order, and cat it!  \n33\\. O (instrument of) wood, settle down upon the strewn barhis, in keeping\nwith the divinities and the agnishloma rites! Well shaped, as if by a\ncarpenter (Tvashtar) with his axe, is thy form. Longing for this (porridge)\nthe (gods) shall be seen about the vessel!  \n34\\. In sixty autumns the treasurer (of the porridge) shall fetch it, by the\ncooked grain he shall obtain heaven; the parents and the children shall live\nupon it. Bring thou this (man) to heaven, into the presence of Agni!  \n35\\. (Thyself) a holder, (O pot), hold on to the foundation of the earth:\nthee, that art immoveable the gods (alone) shall move! Man and wife, alive,\nwith living children, shall remove thee from the hearth of the fire!  \n36\\. Thou hast conquered and reached all worlds; as many as are our wishes,\nthou hast satisfied them. Dip ye in, stirring stick and spoon! Place it (the\npor idge) upon a single dish!  \n37\\. Lay (ghee) upon it, let it spread forth, anoint this dish with ghee! As\nthe lowing cow her young that craves the breast, ye gods shall greet with\nsounds of satisfaction this (porridge)!  \n38\\. With ghee thou hast covered it, hast made this place (for the porridge):\nmay it, peerless, spread afar to heaven! Upon it shall rest the mighty eagle;\ngods shall offer it to the divinities!  \n39\\. Whatever the wife cooks aside from thee, (O husband), or the husband\n(cooks) unbeknown of thee, O wife, mix that together: to both of you it shall\nbelong; bring it together into a single place!  \n40\\. As many of her children as dwell upon the earth, and the sons that have\nbeen begotten by him, all those ye shall call up to the dish: on shall come\nthe young knowing their nest!  \n41\\. The goodly streams, swelling with honey, mixed with ghee, the seats of\nambrosia, all these does he obtain, ascends to heaven. In sixty autumns the\ntreasurer (of the porridge) shall fetch it!  \n42\\. The treasurer shall fetch this treasure: all outsiders round about shall\nnot control it! The heaven-directed porridge, that has been presented and\ndeposited by us, in three divisions has reached the thrte heavens.  \n43\\. May Agni burn the ungodly Rakshas; the flesh-devouring Pisaka shall have\nnothing here to partake of! We drive him away, hold him afar from us: the\n\xc3\x82dityas and Angiras shall stay near it!  \n44\\. To the \xc3\x82dityas and the Angiras do I offer this (food of) honey, mixed\nwith ghee. Do ye two, (man and wife), with clean hands, without having injured\na Brahmana, performing pious deeds, go to that heavenly world!  \n45\\. I would obtain this highest part of it (the porridge), the place from\nwhich the highest lord permeates (the all). Pour butter upon it, anoint it\nwitb plentiful ghee: this here is our share, fit for the Angiras!  \n46\\. For the sake of truth and holy strength do we make over this porridge as\na hoarded treasure to the gods: it shall not be lost to us in gaming or in the\nassembly; do not let it go to any other person before me!  \n47\\. I cook, and I give (to the Brahmans), and so, too, my wife, at my\nreligious rite and practice.--With the birth of a son the world of children\nhas arisen (for you): do ye two hold on to a life that extends beyond (your\nyears)!  \n48\\. In that place exists no guilt, and no duplicity, not even if he goes\nconspiring with his friends. This full dish of ours has here been deposited:\nthe cooked (porridge) shall come back again to him that cooks it!  \n49\\. kind deeds we shall perform for our friends: all that hate us shall go to\ndarkness (hell)!--As (fruitful) cow, and (strong) steer, they (man and wife)\nshall during, every successive period of their lives drive away man-besetting\ndeath!  \n50\\. The fires (all) know one another, that which lives in plants, and lives\nin the waters, and all the (light-) gods that glow upon the heaven. The gold\n(here) becomes the light of him that cooks (the porridge).  \n51\\. This (naked skin) among the hides is born upon man (alone), all other\nanimals are riot naked. Clothe yourselves, (ye Brahmans), in sheltering\ngarments: (even) the face of the porridge is a homespun garment!  \n52\\. What falsehood thou shalt speak at play and in the assembly, or the\nfalsehood that thou shalt speak through lust for gain--put on together, (O man\nand wife), this same garment, deposit upon it every blemish!  \n53\\. Produce rain, go to the gods, let smoke arise from (thy) surface; all-\nembracing, about to be covered with ghee, enter as a co-dweller this place!  \n54\\. In many ways heaven assumes within itself a different form, according to\ncircumstances. It (the heaven) has laid aside its black form, purifying itself\nto a bright (form); the red form do I sacrifice fot thee into the fire.  \n55\\. Thee here we hand over to the eastern direction, to Agni as sovereign\nlord, to the black serpent as guardian, to \xc3\x82ditya as bowman: do ye guard it\nfor us, until we arrive! To the goal here he shall lead us, to old age; old\nage shall hand us over to death: then shall we be united with the cooked\n(porridge)!  \n56\\. Thee here we hand over to the southern direction, to Indra as sovereign\nlord, to the serpent that is striped across as guardian, to Yama as bowman: do\nye guard it for us, until we arrive! To the goal here, &c.  \n57\\. Thee here we hand over to the western direction, to Varuna as sovereign\nlord, to the pridaku-serpent as guardian, to food as bowman: do ye guard it\nfor us, until we arrive. To the goal here, &c.  \n58\\. Thee here we hand over to the northern direction, to Soma as sovereign\nlord, to the svaga-serpent as guardian, to the lightning as bowman: do ye\nguard it for us, until we arrive. To the goal here, &c.  \n59\\. Thee here we hand over to the direction of the nadir, to Vishnu as\nsovereign lord, to the serpent with black-spotted neck as guardian, to the\nplants as bowmen: do ye guard it for us, until we arrive. To the goal here,\n&c.  \n60\\. Thee here we hand over to the direction of the zenith, to Brihaspati as\nsovereign lord, to the light-coloured serpent as guardian, to the rain as\nbowman: do ye guard it for us, until we arrive. To the goal here, &c.\n\n{09003}\n\n## IX, 3. Removal of a house that has been presented to a priest as\nsacrificial reward.\n\n1\\. The fastenings of the buttresses, the supports, and also of the\nconnectinc, beams of the house, that abounds in treasures, do we loosen.  \n2\\. O (house) rich in all treasures! the fetter which has been bound about\nthee, and the knot which has been fastened upon thee, that with my charm do I\nundo, as Brihaspati (undid) Vala.  \n3\\. (The builder) has drawn thee to,,ether, pressed thee together, placed firm\nknots upon thee. Skilfully, as the priest who butchers (the sacrificial\nanimal), do we with Indra's aid disjoint thy limbs.  \n4\\. From thy beams, thy bolts, thy frame, and thy thatch; from thy sides, (O\nhouse) abounding in treasures, do we loosen the fastenings.  \n5\\. The fastenings of the dove-tailed (joints), of the reed (-covering), of\nthe frame-work, do we loosen here from the 'mistress of dwelling.'  \n6\\. The ropes which they have tied within thee for comfort, these do we loosen\nfrom thee; be thou propitious to our persons, O mistress of dwelling, after\nthou hast (again) been erected!  \n7\\. A receptacle for Soma, a house for Agni, a seat for the mistresses (of the\nhouse), a seat (for the priests), a seat for the gods art thou, O goddess\nhouse!  \n8\\. Thy covering of wicker-work, with thousand eyes, stretched out upon thy\ncrown, fastened down and laid on, do we loosen with (this) charm.  \n9\\. He who receives thee as a gift, O house, and he by whom thou hast been\nbuilt, both these, O mistress of dwelling, shall live attaining old age!  \n10\\. Return to him in the other world, firmly bound, ornamented, (thou house),\nwhich we loosen limb by limb, and joint by joint!  \n11\\. He who built thee, O house, brought together (thy) timbers, he, a\nPragapati on high, did construct thee, O house, for his progeny (pragayai).  \n12\\. We render obeisance to him (the builder); obeisance to the giver, the\nlord of the house; obeisance to Agni who serves (the sacrifice); and obeisance\nto thy (attendant) man!  \n13\\. Reverence to the cattle and the horses, and to that which is born in the\nhouse! Thou that hast produced, art rich in offspring, thy fetters do we\nloosen.  \n14\\. Thou dost shelter Agni within, (and) the domestics together with the\ncattle. Thou that hast produced, art rich in offspring, thy fetters do we\nloosen.  \n15\\. The expanse which is between heaven and earth, with that do I receive as\na gift this house of thine; the middle region which is stretched out from the\nsky, that do I make into a receptacle for treasures; with that do I receive\nthe house for this one.  \n16\\. Full of nurture, full of milk, fixed upon the earth, erected, holding\nfood for all, O house, do thou not injure them that receive thee as a gift!  \n17\\. Enveloped in grass, clothed in reeds, like night does the house lodge the\ncattle; erected thou dost stand upon the earth, like a she-elephant, firm of\nfoot.  \n18\\. The part of thee that was covered with mats unfolding do I loosen. Thee\nthat hast been enfolded by Varuna may Mitra uncover in the morning!  \n19\\. The house built with pious word, built by seers, erected--may Indra and\nAgni, the two immortals, protect the house, the seat of Soma!  \n20\\. Chest is crowded upon chest, basket upon basket; there mortal man is\nbegotten from whom all things spring.  \n21\\. In the house which is built with two facades, four facades, six facades;\nin the house with eight facades, with ten facades, in the 'mistress of\ndwelling.' Agni rests as if in the womb.  \nTuirning towards thee that art turned towards me, O house, I come to thee that\ninjurest me not. For Agni and the waters, the first door to divine order, are\nwithin.  \n23\\. These waters, free from disease, destructive of disease, do I bring here.\nThe chambers do I enter in upon in company with the immortal Agni (fire).  \n24\\. Do thou not fasten a fetter upon us; though a heavy load, become thou\nlight! As a bride do we carry thee, O house, wherever we please.  \n25\\. From the easterly direction of the house reverence (be) to greatness,\nhail to the gods who are to be addressed with hail!  \n26\\. From the southerly direction of the house, &c.!  \n27\\. From the westerly direction of the house, &c.!  \n28\\. From the northerly direction of the house, &c.!  \n29\\. From the firm direction (nadir) of the house, &c.!  \n30\\. From the upright direction (zenith) of the house, &c.!  \n3 1. From every direction of the house reverence (be) to greatness, hail to\nthe gods who are to be addressed with hail!\n\n{06071}\n\n## VI, 71. Brahmanical prayer at the receipt of gifts.\n\n1\\. The varied food which I consume in many places, my gold, my horses, and,\ntoo, my cows, goats, and sheep: everything whatsoever that I have received as\na gift--may Agni, the priest, render that an auspicious offering!  \n2\\. The gift that has come to me by sacrifice, or without sacrifice, bestowed\nby the Fathers, granted by men, through which my heart, as it were, lights up\nwith joy--may Agni, the priest, render that an auspicious offering!  \n3\\. The food that I, O gods, improperly consume, (the food) I promise,\nintending to give of it (to the Brahmans), or not to give of it, by the might\nof mighty Vaisvanara (Agni) may (that) food be for me auspicious and full of\nhoney!\n\n{20127}\n\n## XX, 127. A kuntapa-hymn.\n\n### A.\n\n1\\. Listen, ye folks, to this: (a song) in praise of a hero shall be sung! Six\nthousand and ninety (cows) did we get (when we were) with Kaurama among the\nRusamas,--  \n2\\. Whose twice ten buffaloes move right along, touether with their cows; the\nheight of his chariot just misses the heaven which recedes from its touch.  \n3\\. This one (Kaurama) presented the seer with a hundred jewels, ten chaplets,\nthree hundred steeds, and ten thousand cattle.\n\n### B.\n\n4\\. Disport thyself, O chanter, disport thyself as a bird upon a flowering\ntree; thy tongue glides quickly over the lips as a razor over the strop.  \n5\\. The chanters with their pious song hurry on blithely as cows; at home are\ntheir children, and at home the cows do they attend.  \n6\\. Bring hither, O chanter, thy poem, that which earns cattle and earns good\nthings! Among the gods (kings) place thy voice as a manly archer his arrow!\n\n### C.\n\n7\\. Listen ye to the high praise of the king who rules over all peoples, the\ngod who is above mortals, of Vaisvanara Parikshit!  \n8\\. 'Parikshit has procured for us a secure dwelling when he, the most\nexcellent one, weat to his seat.' (Thus) the husband in Kuru-land, when he\nfounds his household, converses with his wife.  \n9\\. 'What may I bring to thee, curds, stirred drink, or liquor?' (Thus) I the\nwife asks her husband in the kingdom of king Parikshit.  \n10\\. Like light the ripe barley runs over beyond the mouth (of the vessels).\nThe people thrive merrily in the kingdom of king Parikshit.\n\n### D.\n\n11\\. Indra has awakened the poet, saying: 'Arise, move about, and sing; of me,\nthe strong, verily, sing the praises; full every pious one shall offer thee\n(sacrificial reward)!'  \n12\\. Here, O cattle, ye shall be born, here, ye horses, here, ye domestics!\nAnd Pushan also, who bestows a thousand (cows) as sacrificial reward, settles\ndown here.  \n13\\. May these cattle, O Indra, not suffer harm, and may their owner not\nsuffer harm; may the hostile folk, O Indra, may the thief not gain possession\nof them!  \n14\\. We shout to the hero with hymn and song we (shout) with a pleasing song.\nTake delight in our songs; may we not ever suffer harm!\n\n# X.\n\n# COSMOGONIC AND THEOSOPHIC HYMNS.\n\n{12001}\n\n## XII, 1. Hymn to goddess Earth.\n\n1\\. Truth, greatness, universal order (rita), strength. consecration, creative\nfervour (tapas), spiritual exaltation (brahma), the sacrifice, support the\nearth. May this earth, the mistress of that which was and shall be, prepare\nfor us a broad domain!  \n2\\. The earth that has heights, and slopes, and great plains, that supports\nthe plants of manifold virtue, free from the pressure that comes from the\nmidst of men, she shall spread out for us, and fit. herself for us!  \n3\\. The earth upon which the sea, and the rivers and the waters, upon which\nfood and the tribes of men have arisen, upon which this breathing, moving life\nexists, shall afford us precedence in drinking!  \n4\\. The earth whose are the four regions of space, upon which food and the\ntribes of men have arisen, which supports the manifold breathing, moving\nthinas, shall afford us cattle and other possessions also!  \n5\\. The earth upon which of old the first men unfolded themselves, upon which\nthe gods overcame the Asuras, shall procure for us (all) kinds of cattle,\nhorses, and fowls, good fortune, and glory!  \n6\\. The earth that supports all, furnishes wealth, the foundation, the golden-\nbreasted resting-place of all living creatures, she that supports Agni\nVaisvanara (the fire), and mates with Indra, the bull, shall furnish us with\nproperty!  \n7\\. The broad -earth, which the sleepless gods ever attentively guard, shall\nmilk for us precious honey, and, moreover, besprinkle us with glory!  \n8\\. That earth which formerly was water upon the ocean (of space), which the\nwise (seers) found out by their skilful devices; whose heart is in the highest\nheaven, immortal, surrounded by truth, shall bestow upon us brilliancy and\nstrength, (and place us) in supreme sovereignty!  \n9\\. That earth upon which the attendant waters jointly flow by day and night\nunceasingly, shall pour out milk for us in rich streams, and, moreover,\nbesprinkle us with glory!  \n10\\. The earth which the Asvins have measured, upon which Vishnu has stepped\nout, which Indra, the lord of might, has made friendly to himself; she, the\nmother, shall pour forth milk for me, the son!  \n11\\. Thy snowy mountain heights, and thy forests, O earth, shall be kind to\nus! The brown, the black, the red, the multi-coloured, the firm earth, that is\nprotected by Indra, I have settled upon, not suppressed, not slain, not\nwounded.  \n12\\. Into thy rniddle set us, O earth, and into thy navel, into the nourishing\nstrength that has grown tip from thy body; purify thyself for us! The earth is\nthe mother, and I the son of the earth; Paro-anya is the father; he, too,\nshall save us!  \n13\\. The earth upon which they (the priests) inclose the altar (vedi), upon\nwhich they, devoted to all (holy) works, unfold the sacrifice, upon which are\nset up, in front of the sacrifice, the sacrificial posts, erect and brilliant,\nthat earth shall prosper us, herself prospering!  \n14\\. Him that hates us, O earth, him that battles against us, him that is\nhostile towards us with his mind and his weapons, do thou subject to us,\nanticipating (our wish) by deed!  \n15\\. The mortals born of thee live on thee, thou supportest both bipeds and\nquadrupeds. Thine, O earth, are these five races of men, the mortals, upon\nwhom the rising sun sheds undying light with his rays.  \n16\\. These creatures all together shall yield milk for us; do thou, O earth,\ngive us the honey of speech!  \n17\\. Upon the firm, broad earth, the all-begetting mother of the plants, that\nis supported by (divine) law, upon her, propitious and kind, may we ever pass-\nour lives!  \n18\\. A great gathering-place thou, great (earth), hast become; great haste,\ncommotion, and agitation are upon thee. Great Indra protects thee unceasingly.\nDo thou, O earth, cause us to brighten as if at the sight of gold: not any one\nshall hate us!  \n19\\. Agni (fire) is in the earth, in the plants, the waters hold Agni, Agni is\nin the stones; Agni is within men, Agnis (fires) are within cattle, within\nhorses.  \n20\\. Agni glows from the sky, to Agni, the god, belongs the broad air. The\nmortals kindle Agni, the bearer of oblations, that loveth ghee.  \n21\\. The earth, clothed in Agni, with dark knees, shall make me brilliant and\nalert!  \n22\\. Upon the earth men give to the gods the sacrifice, the prepared oblation;\nupon the earth mortal men live pleasantly by food. May this earth give us\nbreath and life, may she cause me to reach old age!  \n23\\. The fragrance, O earth, that has arisen upon thee, which the plants and\nthe waters hold, which the Gandharvas and the Apsaras have partaken of, with\nthat make me fragrant: not any one shall hate us!  \n24\\. That fragrance of thine which has entered into the lotus, that fragrance,\nO earth, which the immortals of yore gathered up at the marriage of Surya,\nwith that make me fragrant: not any one shall hate us!  \n25\\. That fragrance of thine which is in men, the loveliness and charm that is\nin male and female, that which is in steeds and heroes, that which is in the\nwild animals with trunks (elephants), the lustre that is in the maiden, O\nearth, with that do thou blend us: not any one shall hate us!  \n26\\. Rock, stone, dust is this earth; this earth is supported, held together.\nTo this golden-breasted earth I have rendered obeisance.  \n27\\. The earth, upon whom the forest-sprung trees ever stand firm, the all-\nnourishing, compact earth, do we invoke.  \n28\\. Rising or sitting, standing or walking, may we not stumble with our right\nor left foot upon the earth!  \n29\\. To the pure earth I speak, to the ground, the soil that has grown through\nthe brahma (spiritual exaltation). Upon thee, that holdest nourishment,\nprosperity, food, and ghee, we would settle down, O earth!  \n30\\. Purified the waters shall flow for our bodies; what flows off from us\nthat do we deposit upon him we dislike: with a purifier, O earth, do I purify\nmyself!  \n31\\. Thy easterly regions, and thy northern, thy southerly (regions), O earth,\nand thy western, shall be kind to me as I walk (upon thee)! May I that have\nbeen placed into the world not fall down!  \n32\\. Do not drive us from the west, nor from the east; not from the north, and\nnot from the south! Security be thou for us, O earth: waylayers shall not find\nus, hold far away (their) murderous weapon!  \n33\\. As long as I look out upon thee, O earth, with Surya (the sun) as my\ncompanion, so long shall my sight not fall, as year followeth upon year!  \n34\\. When, as I lie, I turn upon my right or left side, O earth; when\nstretched out we lie with our ribs upon thee pressing against (us), do not, O\nearth, that liest close to everything, there injure us!  \n35\\. What, O earth, I dig out of thee, quickly shall that grow again: may I\nnot, O pure one, pierce thy vital spot, (and) not thy heart!  \n36\\. Thy summer, O earth, thy rainy season, thy autumn, winter, early spring,\nand spring; thy decreed yearly seasons, thy days and nights shall yield us\nmilk  \n37\\. The pure earth that starts in fright away from the serpent, upon whom\nwere the fires that are within the waters, she that delivers (to destruction)\nthe blasphemous Dasyus, she that takes the side of Indra, not of Vritra, (that\nearth) adheres to Sakra (mighty Indra), the lusty bull.  \n38\\. Upon whom rests the sacrificial hut (sadas) and the (two) vehicles that\nhold the soma (havirdhane), in whom the sacrificial post is fixed, upon whom\nthe Brahmanas praise (the gods) with riks and samans, knowing (also) the\nyagur-formulas; upon whom the serving-priests (ritvig) are employed so that\nIndra shall drink the soma;--  \n39\\. Upon whom the seers of yore, that created the beings, brought forth with\ntheir songs the cows, they the seven active (priests), by means of the satra-\nofferings, the sacrifices, and (their) creative fervour (tapas);--  \n40\\. May this earth point out to us the wealth that we-crave; may Bhaga\n(fortune) add his help, may Indra come here as (our) champion!  \n41\\. The earth upon whom the noisy mortals sing and dance, upon whom they\nfight, upon whom resounds the roaring drum, shall drive forth our enemies,\nshall make us free from rivals!  \n42\\. To the earth upon whom are food, and rice and barley, upon whom live\nthese five races of men, to the earth, the wife of Parganya, that is fattened\nby rain, be reverence!  \n43\\. The earth upon whose ground the citadels constructed by the gods unfold\nthemselves, every region of her that is the womb of all, Pragapati shall make\npleasant for us!  \n44\\. The earth that holds treasures manifold in secret places, wealth, jewels,\nand gold shall she give to me; she that bestows wealth liberally, the kindly\ngoddess, wealth shall she bestow upon us!  \n45\\. The earth that holds people of manifold varied speech, of different\ncustoms, according to their habitations, as a reliable milch-cow that does not\nkick, shall she milk for me a thousand streams of wealth!  \n46\\. The serpent, the scorpion with thirsty fangs, that hibernating torpidly\nlies upon thee; the worm, and whatever living thing, O earth, moves in the\nrainy season, shall, when it creeps, not creep upon us: with what is\nauspicious (on thee) be gracious to us!  \n47\\. Thy many paths upon which people go, thy tracks for chariots and wagons\nto advance, upon which both good and evil men proceed, this road, free from\nenemies, and free from thieves, may we gain: with what is auspicious (on thee)\nbe gracious to us!  \n48\\. The earth holds the fool and holds the wise, endures that good and bad\ndwell (upon her); she keeps company with the boar, gives herself up to the\nwild hog.  \n49\\. Thy forest animals, the wild animals homed in the woods, the man-eating\nlions, and tigers that roam; the ula, the wolf, mishap, injury (rikshika), and\ndemons (rakshas), O earth, drive away from us!  \n50\\. The Gandharvas, the Apsaras, the Arayas and Kimidins; the Pisakas and all\ndemons (rakshas), these, O earth, hold from us!  \n51\\. The earth upon whom the biped birds fly together, the flamingoes, eagles,\nbirds of prey, and fowls; upon whom Matarisvan, the wind, hastens, raising the\ndust, and tossing the trees-as the wind blows forth and back the flame bursts\nafter;--  \n52\\. The earth upon whom day and night jointly, black and bright, have been\ndecreed, the broad earth covered and enveloped with rain, shall kindly place\nus into every pleasant abode!  \n53\\. Heaven, and earth, and air have here given me expanse; Agni, Surya, the\nwaters, and all the gods together have given me wisdom.  \n54\\. Mighty am I, 'Superior' (uttara) by name, upon the earth, conquering am\nI, all-conquering, completely conquering every region.  \n55\\. At that time, O goddess, when, spreading., (prathamana) forth, named\n(prithivi 'broad') by the gods, thou didst extend to greatness, then\nprosperity did enter thee, (and) thou didst fashion the four regions.  \n56\\. In the villages and in the wilderness, in the assembly-halls that are\nupon the earth; in the gatherings, and in the meetings, may we hold forth\nagreeably to thee!  \n57\\. As dust a steed did she, as soon as she was born, scatter these people,\nthat dwelt upon the earth, she the lovely one, the leader, the guardian of the\nworld, that holds the trees and plants.  \n58\\. The words I speak, honied do I speak them: the things I see they furnish\nme with. Brilliant I am and alert: the others that rush (against me) do I beat\ndown.  \n59\\. Gentle, fragrant, kindly, with the sweet drink (kilala) in her udder,\nrich in milk, the broad earth together with (her) milk shall give us courage!  \n60\\. She whom Visvakarman (the creator of all) did search out by means of\noblations, when she had entered the surging (flood of the) atmosphere, she,\nthe vessel destined to nourish, deposited in a secret place, became visible\n(to the gods) and the (heavenly) mothers.  \n61\\. Thou art the scatterer of men, the broadly expanding Aditi that yields\nmilk according to wish. What is wanting in thee Pragapati, first-born of the\ndivine order (rita), shall supply for thee  \n62\\. Thy laps, O earth, free from ailment! Free from disease, shall be\nproduced for us! May we attentively, throuoh our long lives, be bearers of\nbali-offerings to thee!  \n63\\. O mother earth, kindly set me down upon a well-founded place! With\n(father) heaven cooperating, O thou wise one, do thou place me into happiness\nand prosperity!\n\n{13001}\n\n## XIII, 1. Prayer for sovereign power addressed to the god Rohita and his\nfemale Rohini.\n\n1\\. Rise up, O steed, that art within the waters, enter this kingdom, rich in\nliberal gifts! Rohita (the red sun) who has begotten this all, shall keep thee\nwell-supported for sovereignty!  \n2\\. The steed that is within the waters has risen up: ascend upon the clans\nthat are sprung from thee! Furnishing soma, the waters, plants, and cows,\ncause thou four-footed and two-footed creatures to enter here!  \n3\\. Do ye, strong Maruts, children of Prisni (the cloud), allied with Indra,\ncrush the enemies! Rohita shall hear you, that give abundant gifts, the thrice\nseven Maruts, who take delight in sweet (nourishment)!  \n4\\. Rohita has climbed the heights, he has ascended them, he, the embryo of\nwomen, (has ascended) the womb of births. Closely united with these women they\nfound out the six broad (directions); spying out a road he has brought hither\nsovereignty.  \n5\\. Hither to thee Rohita has brought sovereignty; he has dispersed the\nenemies: freedom from danger has resulted for thee. To thee heaven and earth\ntogether with the revati and sakvari-stanzas shall yield gifts at will!  \n6\\. Rohita produced heaven and earth; there Parameshthin (the lord on high)\nextended the thread (of the sacrifice). There Aga Ekapada (the one-footed\ngoat, the sun) did fix himself; he made firm the heavens and earth with his\nstrength.  \n7\\. Rohita made firm heaven and earth, by him the (heavenly) light was\nestablished, by him the firmament. By him the atmosphere and the spaces were\nmeasured out, through him the gods obtained immortality.  \n8\\. Rohita did ponder the multiform (universe) while preparing (his) climbings\nand advances. Having ascended the heaven with great might, he shall anoint thy\nroyalty with milk and ghee!  \n9\\. All thy climbings, advances, and all thy ascents with which thou, (Rohita,\nthe sun), fillest the heavens and the atmosphere, having strengthened thyself\nwith their brahma and payas (spiritual and physical essence) do thou keep\nawake (do thou watch over) among the people in the kingdom of the (earthly)\nRohita (the king)!  \n10\\. The peoples that have originated from thy tapas (heat, or creative\nfervour), have followed here the calf, the gayatri. They shall enter thee with\nkindly spirit; the calf Rohita with its mother shall come on!  \n11\\. High on the firmament Rohita has stood, a youth, a sage, begettinu all\nforms. As Agni he shines with piercing light, in the third space he did assume\nlovely (forms).  \n12\\. A bull with a thousand horns, Gatavedas (fire), endowed with sacrifices\nof ghee, carrying soma upon his back, rich in heroes, he shall, when implored,\nnot abandon me, nor may I abandon thee: abundance in cattle and abundance in\nheroes procure for me!  \n14\\. Rohita is the generator of the sacrifice, and its mouth; to Rohita I\noffer oblations with voice, ear, and mind. To Rohita the gods resort with glad\nmind: he shall cause me to rise through elevation derived from the assembly!  \n14\\. Rohita arranged a sacrifice for Visvakarman; from it these brilliant,\nqualities have come to me. Let me announce thy origin over the extent of the\nworld!  \n15, Upon thee have ascended the brihati and the pankti (metres), upon thee the\nkakubh with splendour, O Gatavedas. Upon thee the vashat-call, whose syllables\nmake an ushniha, has ascended, upon thee Rohita with his seed has ascended.  \n16\\. This one clothes himself in the womb of the earth, this one clothes\nhimself in heaven, and in the atmosphere. This one at the station of the brown\n(sun) did attain unto the worlds of light.  \n17\\. O Vakaspati (lord of speech), the earth shall be pleasant to us, pleasant\nour dwelling, agrecable our couches! Right here life's breath shall be to our\nfriend; thee, O Parameshthin, Agni shall envelop in life and lustre!  \n18\\. O Vakaspati, the five seasons that we have, which have come about as the\ncreation of Visvakarman, rialit here (they and) life's breath shall be to our\nfriend; thee, O Parameshthin, Rohita shall envelop in life and lustre!  \n19\\. O Vakaspati, good cheer and spirit, cattle in our stable, children in our\nwombs beget thou! Right here life's breath shall be to our friend; thee, O\nParameshthin, I envelop in life and lustre.  \n20\\. God Savitar and Agni shall envelop thee, Mitra and Varuna surround thee\nwith lustre! Treading down all powers of grudge come thou hither: thou hast\nmade this kingdom rich in liberal gifts.  \n21\\. Thou, O Rohita, whom the brindled cow, harnessed at the side, carries,\ngoest with brilliance, causing the waters to flow.  \n22\\. Devoted to Rohita is Rohini his mistress, with beautiful colour\n(complexion), great, and lustrous: through her may we conquer booty of every\ndescription, through her win every battle!  \n23\\. This seat, Rohini, belongs to Rohita; yonder is the path on which the\nbrindled (female) goes! Her the Gandharvas and the Kasyapas lead forth, her\nthe sages guard with diligence.  \n24\\. The radiant bay steeds of the sun, the immortal, ever draw the delightful\nchariot. Rohita, the drinker of ghee, the shining god, did enter the\nvariegated heavens.  \n25\\. Rohita, the sharp-horned bull, who surpasses Agni and surpasses Surya,\nwho props up the earth and the sky, out of him the gods frame the creations.  \n26\\. Rohita ascended the heaven from the great flood; Rohita has climbed all\nheights.  \n27\\. Create (the cow) that is rich in milk, drips with ghee: she is the milch-\ncowof the gods that does not refuse! Indra shall drink the Soma, there shall\nbe secure possession; Agni shall sing praises: the enemies do thou drive out!  \n28\\. Agni kindled, spreads his flames, fortified by ghee, sprinkled with ghee.\nVictorious, all-conquering Agni shall slay them that are my rivals!  \n29\\. He shall slay them, shall burn the enemy that battles against us! With\nthe flesh-devouring Agni do we burn our rivals.  \n30\\. Smite them down, O Indra, with the thunderbolt, with thy (strong) arm!\nThen have I overpowered my rivals with Agni's brilliant strengths.  \n31\\. O Agni, subject our rivals to us; confuse, O Brihaspati, the kinsman that\nis puffed up! O Indra and Agni, O Mitra and Varuna, subjected they shall be,\nunable to vent their wrath against us!  \n32\\. Do thou, god Surya (the sun), when thou risest, beat down my rivals, beat\nthem down with a stone: they shall go to the nethermost darkness!  \n33\\. The calf of Virag, the bull of prayers, carrying the bright (soma) upon\nhis back, has ascended the atmosphere. A song accompanied by ghee they sing to\nthe calf; himself brahma (spiritual exaltation) they swell him with their\nbrahma (prayer).  \n34\\. Ascend the heavens, ascend the earth sovereignty ascend thou, and\npossessions ascend thou! Offspring ascend thou, and immortality ascend thou,\nunite thy body with Rohita!  \n35\\. The gods that hold sovereignty, who go about the sun, with these allied,\nRohita, kindly disposed, shall bestow sovereignty upon thee!  \n36\\. The sacrifices purified by prayer lead thee forth; the bay steeds that\ntravel upon the road carry thee: thou shinest across the swelling ocean.  \n37\\. In Rohita who conquers wealth, conquers cattle, and conquers booty,\nheaven and earth are fixed. Of thee that hast a thousand and seven births, let\nme announce the origin over the extent of the world!  \n38\\. Glorious thou goest to the intermediate directions and the directions (of\nspace), glorious (in the sight) of animals and the tribes of men, glorious in\nthe lap of the earth, of Aditi: may I like Savitar be lovely!  \n39\\. Being yonder thou knowest (what takes place) here; being here thou\nbeholdest these things. Here (men) behold the inspired sun that shines upon\nthe sky.  \n40\\. A god thou praisest the gods, thou movest within the flood. They kindle\n(him), a universal fire; him the highest sages know.  \n41\\. Below the superior (region), above the inferior (region) here, the cow\nhas arisen supporting (her) calf by the foot. Whither is she turned; to which\nhalf (of the universe), forsooth, has she aone away; where, forsooth, does she\nbeget? Verily not in this herd!  \n42\\. One-footed, two-footed, four-footed is she; eight-footed, nine-footed\nbecame she, the thousand-syllabled (consisting of thousand elements) pankti\n(quinary stanza) of the universe: the oceans from her flow forth upon (the\nworld).  \n43\\. Ascending the heaven, immortal, receive kindly my song! The sacrifices\npurified by prayer lead thee forth; the bay steeds that travel upon the road\ncarry thee.  \n44\\. That do I know of thee, O immortal, where thy march is upon the sky,\nwhere thy habitation is in the highest heaven.  \n45\\. Surya (the sun) surveys the sky, Surya the earth, Surya the waters. Surya\nis the single eye of being: he has ascended the great heavens.  \n46\\. The broad (directions) where the fagots that fence in (the fire), the\nearth turned itself into a fire-altar. There Rohita laid on for himself these\ntwo fires, cold and heat.  \n47\\. Laying on cold and heat, using the mountains as sacrificial posts, the\ntwo fires of Rohita who knows the (heavenly) light, into which (the fires)\nrain (flowed) as ghee, carried out the sacrifice.  \n48\\. The fire of Rohita who knows the (heavenly) light is kindled by prayer.\nFrom it heat, from it cold, from it the sacrifice was produced.  \n49\\. The two fires swelling through prayer, increased through prayer,\nsacrificed into with prayer; the two fires of Rohita who knows the (heavenly)\nlight, kindled through prayer, carried out the sacrifice.  \n50\\. One is deposited in truth, the other is kindled in the waters. The two\nfires of Rohita who knows the (heavenly) light, kindled through prayer,\ncarried out the sacrifice.  \n51\\. The fire which the wind brightens up, and that which Indra and\nBrahmanaspati (brighten up), the two fires of Rohita who knows the (heavenly)\nlight, kindled through prayer, carried out the sacrifice.  \n52\\. Having fashioned the earth into an altar, having made the heavens (his)\nsacrificial reward, then having made heat into fire, Rohita created all that\nhas breath through rain (serving) as ghee.  \n53\\. Rain fashioned itself into ghee, heat into fire, the earth into an altar.\nThen Agni by (his) songs fashioned the high mountains.  \n54\\. Having fashioned by means of songs the high (mountains), Rohita spake to\nthe earth: In thee all shall be born, what is and what shall be.  \n55\\. The sacrifice first, (and then) what is and what shall be was born. From\nthat this all was born, and whatever here appears, brought hither by the sage\nRohita.  \n56\\. He who kicks a cow with his foot, and he who micturates towards the sun--\nof thee do I tear out the root; thou shalt henceforth not cast a shadow!  \n57\\. Thou that passest across me, casting thy shadow against me, between me\nand the fire--of thee do I tear out the root; thou shalt henceforth not cast a\nshadow!  \n58\\. He, O god Surya, that to-day passes between thee and me, upon him our\nevil dream, our foulness, and our misfortunes do we wipe off.  \n59\\. May we not miss our way, may we not, O Indra, miss the sacrifice of him\nthat presses the soma; may.not the powers of grudge intercept us!  \n60\\. The (guiding) thread stretched out among the gods, that accomplishes the\nsacrifice, that, by pouring oblations, may we attain!\n\n{11005}\n\n## XI, 5. Glorification of the sun, or the primeval principle, as a Brahman\ndisciple.\n\n1\\. The Brahmakarin (Brahmanical disciple) moves inciting both hemispheres of\nthe world; in him the gods are harmonised. He holds the heavens and the earth,\nhe fills the teacher with creative fervour (tapas).  \n2\\. The fathers, the divine folk, and all the gods severally follow the\nBrahmakarin; the Gandharvas did go after him, six thousand three hundred and\nthirty-three. He fills all the gods with creative fervour.  \n3\\. When the teacher receives the Brahmakarin as a disciple, he places him as\na foetus inside (of his body). He carries him for three nights in his belly:\nwhen he is born the gods gather about to see him.  \n4\\. This earth is (his first) piece of firewood, the heaven the second, and\nthe atmosphere also he fills with (the third) piece of firewood. The\nBrahmakarin. fills the worlds with his firewood, his girdle, his asceticism,\nand his creative fervour.  \n5\\. Prior to the brahma (spiritual exaltation) the Brahmakarin was born;\nclothed in heat, by creative fervour he arose. From him sprung the brahmanam\n(Brahmanic life) and the highest brahma, and all the gods together with\nimmortality (amrita).  \n6\\. The Brahmakarin advances, kindled by the firewood, clothed in the skin of\nthe black antelope, consecrated, with long beard. Within the day he passes\nfrom the eastern to the northern sea; gathering together the worlds he\nrepeatedly shapes them.  \n7\\. The Brahmakarin, begetting the brahma, the waters, the world, Pragapati\nParameshthin (he that stands in the hiahest place), and Virag, having become\nan embryo in the womb of immortality, having forsooth, become Indra, pierced\nthe Asuras.  \n8\\. The teacher fashioned these two hern spheres of the world, the broad and\nthe deep, earth and heaven. These the Brahmakarin guards with his creative\nfervour (tapas): in him the gods are harmonised.  \n9\\. This broad earth and the heaven the Brahmakarin first brought hither as\nalms. Having made these into two sticks of firewood he reveres them upon them\nall beings have been founded.  \n10\\. One is on the hither side, the other on the farther side of the back of\nthe heavens; secretly are deposited the two receptacles of the brahmanam\n(Brahmanic life). These the Brahmakarin protects by his tapas (creative\nfervour); understandingly he performs that brahma (spiritual exaltation)\nsolely.  \n11\\. One on the hither side, the other away from the earth, do the two Agnis\ncome together between these two hemispheres (of the world). To them adhere the\nrays firmly; the Brahmakarin by his tapas (creative fervour) enters into the\n(rays).  \n12\\. Shouting forth, thundering, red, white he carries a great penis along the\nearth. The Brahmakarin sprinkles seed upon the back of the earth; through it\nthe four directions live.  \n13\\. Into fire, the sun, the moon, Matarisvan (wind), and the waters, the\nBrahmakarin places the firewood; the lights from these severally go into the\nclouds, from them come sacrificial butter, the purusha (primeval man), rain,\nand water.  \n14\\. Death is the teacher, (and) Varuna, Soma, the plants, milk; the clouds\nwere the warriors: by these this light has been brought hither.  \n15\\. Varuna, having become the teacher, at home prepares the ghee solely.\nWhatever he desired from Pragapati, that the Brahmakarin furnished, as Mitra\n(a friend) from his own Atman (spirit, or person).  \n16\\. The Brahmakarin is the teacher, the Brahmakarin Pragapati. Pragapati\nrules (shines forth, vi ragati); Virag (heavenly power, or light) became\nIndra, the ruler.  \n17\\. Through holy disciplehood. (brahmakaryam), through tapas (creative\nfervour), the king protects his kingdom. The teacher by (his own) brahmakaryam\n(holy life) seeks (finds) the Brahmakarin.  \n18\\. Through holy disciplehood the maiden obtains a young husband, through\nholy disciplehood the steer, the horse seeks to obtain fodder.  \n19\\. Through holy disciplehood, through creative fervour, the gods drove away\ndeath. Indrajorsooth, by his holy disciplehood brought the light to the gods.  \n20\\. The plants, that which was and shall be, day and night, the tree, the\nyear along with the seasons, have sprung from the Brahmakarin.  \n21\\. The earthly and the heavenly animals, the wild and the domestic, the\nwingless and the winged (animals), have sprung from the Brahmakarin.  \n22\\. All the creatures of Pragapati (the creator) severally carry breath in\ntheir souls. All these the brahma, which has been brought hither in the\nBrahmakarin, protects.  \n23\\. This, that was set into motion by the gods, that is insurmountable, that\nmoves shining, from it has sprung the brahmanam (Brahmanical life), the\nhighest brahma, and all the gods, together with immortality (amrita).  \n24, 25. The Brahmakarin carries the shining brahma: into this all the gods are\nwoven. Producing in-breathing and out-breathing, as well as through-breathing;\nspeech, mind, heart, brahma, and wisdom, do thou furnish us with sight,\nhearing, glory, food, semen, blood, and belly!  \n26\\. These things the Brahmakarin fashioned upon the back of the (heavenly)\nwater. He stood in the sea kindled with tapas (creative fervour). He, when he\nhas bathed, shines vigorously upon the earth, brown and ruddy.\n\n{11004}\n\n## XI, 4. Prana, life or breath, personified as the supreme spirit.\n\n1\\. Reverence to Prana, to whom all this (universe) is subject, who has become\nthe lord of the all, on whom the all is supported!  \n2\\. Reverence, O Prana, to thy roaring (wind), reverence, O Prana, to thy\nthunder, reverence, O Prana, to thy lightning, reverence, O Prana, to thy\nrain!  \nWhen Prana calls aloud to the plants with his thunder, they are fecundated,\nthey conceive, and then are produced abundant (plants).  \n4\\. When the season has arrived, and Prana calls aloud to the plants, then\neverything rejoices, whatsoever is upon the earth.  \n5\\. When Prana has watered the great earth with rain, then the beasts rejoice;\n(they think): 'strength, forsooth, we shall now obtain.'  \n6\\. When they had been watered by Prana, the plants spake in concert: 'thou\nhast, forsooth, prolonged our life, thou hast made us all fragrant.'  \n7\\. Reverence be, O Prana, to thee coming, reverence to thee going; 'reverence\nto thee standing, and reverence, too, to thee sitting!  \n8\\. Reverence be to thee, O Prana, when thou breatbest in (primate), reverence\nwhen thou breathest out! Reverence be to thee when thou art turned away,\nreverence to thee when thou art turned hither: to thee, entire, reverence be\nhere!  \n9\\. Of thy dear form, O Prana, of thy very dear form, of the healing power\nthat is thine, give unto us, that we may live!  \n10\\. Prana clothes the creatures, as a father his dear son. Prana, truly, is\nthe lord of all, of all that breathes, and does not breathe.  \n11\\. Prana is death, Prana is fever. The gods worship Prana. Prana shall place\nthe truth-speaker in the highest world  \n12\\. Prana is Virag (power, lustre), Prana is Deshtri (the divinity that\nguides): all worship Prana. Prana verily is sun and moon. They call Prana\nPragapati.  \n13\\. Rice and barley are in-breathing and outbreathing. Prana is called a\nsteer. In-breathing forsooth, is founded upon barley; rice is called out-\nbreathing.  \n14\\. Man breathes out and breathes in when within the womb. When thou, O\nPrana, quickenest him, then is he born again.  \n15\\. They call Prana Matarisvan (the wind); Prana, forsooth, is called Vata\n(the wind). The past and the future, the all, verily is supported upon Prana.  \n16\\. The holy (atharvana) plants, the magic (angirasa) plants, the divine\nplants, and those produced by men, spring forth, when thou, O Prana,\nquickenest them.  \n17, When Prana has watered the great earth with rain, then the plants spring\nforth, and also every sort of herb.  \n18\\. Whoever, O Prana, knows this regarding thee, and (knows) on what thou art\nsupported, to him all shall offer tribute in yonder highest world.  \n19\\. As all these creatures, O Prana, offer thee tribute, so they shall offer\ntribute (in yonder world) to him who hears thee, O far-famed one!  \n20\\. He moves as an embryo within the gods; having arrived, and being in\nexistence, he is born again. Having arisen he enters with his mights the\npresent and the future, as a father (goes to) his son.  \n21\\. When as a swan he rises from the water he does not withdraw his one foot.\nIf in truth he were to withdraw it, there would be neither to-day, nor to-\nmorrow, no night and no day, never would the dawn appear.  \n22\\. With eight wheels, and one felloe he moves, containing a thousand sounds\n(elements), upward in the east, downward in the west. With (his) half he\nproduced the whole world: what is the visible sign of his (other) half?  \n23\\. He who rules over this (all) derived from every source, and over\neverything that movesreverence be to thee, O Prana, that wieldest a swift bow\nagainst others (the enemies)!  \n24\\. May Prana, who rules over this (all) derived from every source, and over\neverything that moves, (may he) unwearied, strong through the brahma, adhere\nto me!  \n25\\. Erect he watches in those that sleep, nor does lie lie down across. No\none has heard of his sleeping in those that sleep.  \n26\\. O Prana, be not turned away from me, thou shalt not be other than myself!\nAs the embryo of the waters (fire), thee, O Prana, do bind to me, that I may\nlive.\n\n{09002}\n\n## IX, 2. Prayer to Kama (love), personified as a primordial power.\n\n1\\. To the bull that slays the enemy, to Kama, do I render tribute with ghee,\noblation, and (sacrificial) melted butter. Do thou, since thou hast been\nextolled, hurl down my enemies by thy great might!  \n2\\. The evil dream which is offensive to my mind and eye, which harasses and\ndoes not please me, that (dream) do I let loose upon my enemy. Having praised\nKama may I prevail!  \n3,. Evil dreams, O Kama, and misfortune, O Kama, childlessness, ill-health,\nand trouble, do thou, a strong lord, let loose upon him that designs evil\nagainst us!  \n4\\. Drive them away, O Kama, thrust them away, O Kama; may they that are my\nenemies fall into trouble! When they have been driven into the nethermost\ndarkness, do thou, O Agni, burn up their d welling- places!  \n5\\. That milch-cow, O Kama, whom the sages call Vak Virag (ruling, or\nresplendent speech), is said to be thy daughter; by her drive away my enemies;\nbreath, cattle, and life shall give them a wide birth!  \n6\\. With the strength of Kama, Indra, king Varuna, and Vishnu, with the\nimpelling force (savena) of Savitar, with the priestly power of Agni, do I\ndrive forth the enemies, as a skilled steersman a boat.  \n7\\. My sturdy guardian, strong Kama, shall procure for me full freedom from\nenmity! May the gods collectively be my refuge, may all the gods respond to\nthis, my invocation!  \n8\\. Taking pleasure in this (sacrificial) melted butter, and ghee do ye, (O\ngods), of whom Kama is the highest, be joyful in this place, procuring for me\nfull freedom from enmity!  \n9\\. O Indra and Agni, and Kama, having formed an alliance, do ye hurl down my\nenemies; when they have fallen into the nethermost darkness, do thou, O Agni,\nburn up after them their dwelling places!  \n10\\. Slay thou, O Kama, those that are my enemies, hurl them down into blind\ndarkness. Devoid of vigour, Without sap let them all be; they shall not live a\nsingle day!  \n11\\. Kama has slain those that are my enemies, a broad space has he furnished\nme to thrive in. May the four directions of space bow down to me, and the six\nbroad (regions) carry ghee to me!  \n12\\. They (the enemies) shall float down like a boat cut loose from its\nmoorings! There is no returning again for those who have been struck by our\nmissiles.  \n13\\. Agni is a defence, Indra a defence, Soma a defence. May the gods, who by\ntheir defence ward off (the enemy), ward him off!  \n14\\. With his men reduced, driven out, the hated (enemy) shall go, shunned by\nhis own friends! And down upon the earth do the lightnings alight; may the\nstrong god crush your enemies!  \n15\\. This mighty lightning supports both moveable and immoveable things, as\nwell as all thunders. May the rising sun by his resources and his majesty hurl\ndown my enemies, lie the mighty one!  \n16\\. With that triple-armoured powerful covering of thine, O Kama, with the\ncharm that has been made into an Invulnerate armour spread (over thee), with\nthat do thou drive away those who are my enemies; may breath, cattle, and life\ngive them a wide berth!  \n17\\. With the weapon with which the god drove forth the Asuras, with which\nIndra led the Dasyus to the nethermost darkness, with that do thou, O Kama,\ndrive forth far away from this world those who are my enemies!  \n18\\. As the gods drove forth the Asuras, as Indra. forced the demons into the\nnethermost darkness, thus do thou, O Kama, drive forth far away from this\nworld those who are my enemies!  \n19\\. Kama was born at first; him neither the gods, nor the Fathers, nor men\nhave equalled. To these art thou superior, and ever great; to thee, O Kama, do\nI verily offer reverence.  \n20\\. As great as are the heavens and earth in extent, as far as the waters\nhave swept, as far as fire; to these art thou superior, &c.  \n21\\. Great as are the directions (of space) and the intermediate direction on\neither side, great as are the regions and the vistas of the sky; to these art\nthou superior, &c.  \n22\\. As many bees, bats, kururu-worms, as many vaghas and tree-serpents as\nthere are; to these art thou superior, &c.  \n23\\. Superior art thou to all that winks (lives), superior to all that stands\nstill (is not alive), superior to the ocean art thou, O Kama, Manyu! To these\nart thou superior, &c.  \n24\\. Not, surely, does the wind equal Kama, not the fire, not the sun, and not\nthe moon. To these art thou superior, &c.  \n25\\. With those auspicious and gracious forms of thine, O Kama, through which\nwhat thou wilst becometh reaL with these do thou enter into us, and elsewhere\nsend the evil thoughts!\n\n{19053}\n\n## XIX, 53. Prayer to Kala (time), personified as a primordial power.\n\n1\\. Time, the steed, runs with seven reins (rays), thousand-eyed, ageless,\nrich in seed. The seers, thinking holy thoughts, mount him, all the beings\n(worlds) are his wheels.  \n2\\. With seven wheels does this Time ride, seven naves has he, immortality is\nhis axle. He carries hither all these beings (worlds). Time, the first god,\nnow hastens onward.  \n3\\. A full jar has been placed upon Time; him, verily, we see existing in many\nforms. He carries away all these beings (worlds); they call him Time in the\nhighest heaven.  \n4\\. He surely did bring hither all the beings (worlds), he surely did\nencompass all the beings (worlds). Being their father, he became their son;\nthere is, verily, no other force, higher than he.  \n5\\. Time begot yonder heaven, Time also (begot) these earths. That which was,\nand that which shall be, urged forth by Time, spreads out.  \n6\\. Time created the earth, in Time the sun burns. In Time are all beings, in\nTime the eye looks abroad.  \n7\\. In Time mind is fixed, in Time breath (is fixed), in Time names (are\nfixed); when Time has arrived all these creatures rejoice.  \n8\\. In Time tapas (creative fervour) is fixed; in Time the highest (being is\nfixed); in Time brahma (spiritual exaltation) is fixed; Time is the lord of\neverything, he was the father of Pragapati.  \n9\\. By him this (universe) was urged forth, by him it was begotten, and upon\nhim this (universe) was founded. Time, truly, having become the brahma\n(spiritual exaltation), supports Parameshthin (the highest lord).  \n10\\. Time created the creatures (pragah), and Time in the beginning (created)\nthe lord of creatures (Pragapati); the self-existing Kasyapa and the tapas\n(creative fervour) from Time were born.\n\n{19054}\n\n## XIX, 54. Prayer to Kala (time), personified as a primordial power.\n\n1\\. From Time the waters did arise, from Time the brahma (spiritual\nexaltation), the tapas (creative fervour), the regions (of space did arise).\nThrough Time the sun rises, in Time he goes down again.  \n2\\. Through Time the wind blows, through Time (exists) the great earth; the\ngreat sky is fixed in Time. In Time the son (Pragapati) begot of yore that\nwhich was, and that which shall be.  \n3\\. From Time the Riks arose, the Yagus was born from Time; Time put forth the\nsacrifice, the imperishable share of the gods.  \n4\\. Upon Time the Gandharvas and Apsarases are founded, upon Time the worlds\n(are founded), in Time this Angiras and Atharvan rule over the heavens.  \n5\\. Having conquered this world and the highest world, and the holy (pure)\nworlds (and) their holy divisions; having by means of the brahma (spiritual\nexaltation) conquered all the worlds, Time, the highest God, forsooth, hastens\nonward.\n\n{11007}\n\n## XI, 7.

Hymn to the honey-lash of the Asvins.\n\n1\\. From heaven, from earth, from the atmosphere, from the sea, from the fire,\nand from the wind, the honey-lash hath verily sprung. This, clothed in amrita\n(ambrosia), all the creatures revering, acclaim in their hearts.  \n2\\. Great sap of all forms (colours) it hath-they call thee moreover the seed\nof the ocean. Where the honey-lash comes bestowing gifts, there life's breath,\nand there immortality has settled down.  \n3\\. Men severally, contemplating it profoundly, behold its action upon the\nearth: from the fire and from the wind the honey-lash hath verily sprung, the\nstrong child of the Maruts.  \n4\\. Mother of the \xc3\x82dityas, daughter of the Vasus, breath of life of created\nbeings, nave of immortality, the honey-lash, golden-coloured, dripping ghee,\nas a great embryo, moves among mortals.  \n5\\. The god's begot the lash of honey, from it came an embryo having all forms\n(colours). This, as soon as born, (while yet) young its mother nourishes;\nthis, as soon as born, surveys all the worlds.  \n6\\. Who knows it and who perceives it, the inexhaustible, soma-holding cup\nthat has come from the heart of it (the honey-lash)? 'Tis the wise priest: he\nshall derive inspiration from it!  \n7\\. He knows them, and he perceives them, the inexhaustible breasts of it (the\nhoney-lash), that yield a thousand streams. Nourishment they pour out -without\nrecalcitration.  \n8\\. The great (cow) that loudly gives forth the sound 'him,' that bestows\nstrength, and goes with loud shouts to the holy act, bellowing with lust for\nthe three (male) gharmas (fires), she lows, and drips with (streams) of milk.  \n9\\. When the waters, the mighty bulls, self-sovereign, wait upon (the cow),\nswollen with milk, (then) they, the waters, pour nourishment (upon her), and\ncause her to pour nourishment at will for him that knoweth this.  \n10\\. The thunder is thy voice, O Pragapati; as a bull thou hurlest thy fire\nupon the earth. From the fire, and from the wind the honey-lash hath verily\nsprung, the strong child of the Maruts.  \n11\\. As the soma at the morn ing-pressure is dear to the Asvins, thus in my\nown person, O Asvins, lustre shall be sustained!  \n12\\. As the soma at the second (mid-day) pressure is dear to Indra and Agni,\nthus in my own person, O Indra, and Agni, lustre shall be sustained!  \n13\\. As the soma at the third pressure (evening) is dear to the Ribhus, thus\nin my own person, O Ribhus, lustre shall be sustained!  \n14\\. May I beget honey for myself; may I obtain honey for myself! Bringing\nmilk, O Agni, I have come:. endow me with lustre!  \n15\\. Endow me, O Agni, with lustre, endow me with offspring and with life! May\nthe gods take note of this (prayer) of mine; may Indra together with the\nRishis (take note of it)!  \n16\\. As bees carry together honey upon honey, thus in my own person, O Asvins,\nlustre shall be sustained!  \n17\\. As the bees pile this honey upon honey, thus in my own person, O Asvins,\nlustre, brilliance, strength, and force shall be sustained!  \n18\\. The honey that is in the mountains, in the heights; in the cows, and in\nthe horses; the honey which is in the sura (brandy) as it is being poured out,\nthat shall be in me!  \n19\\. O Asvins, lords of brightness, anoint me with the honey of the bee, that\nI may speak forceful speech among men!  \n20\\. The thunder is thy speech, O Pragapati; as a bull thou hurlest thy fire\nupon earth and heaven. All animals live upon it (the earth), and she with it\n(Pragapati's fire) fills nourishment and food.  \n21\\. The earth is the staff, the atmosphere the embryo, the heaven the whip\n(itself?), the lightning the whip-cord; of gold is the tip (of the whip?).  \n22\\. He that knoweth the seven honies of the whip becomes rich in honey; (to\nwit), the Brahmana, the king, the cow, the ox, rice, barley, and honey as the\nseventh.  \n23\\. Rich in honey becomes he, rich in honey become his appurtenances, worlds\nrich in honey does he win, he that knoweth thus.  \n24\\. When in a bright sky it thunders, then Pragapati manifests himself to\n(his) creatures (pragah). Therefore do I stand with the sacred cord suspended\nfrom the right shoulder (prakinopavita), saying, 'O Pragapati, watch over me!'\nThe creatures (pragah) watch over him, Pragapati watches over him, that\nknoweth thus.\n\n"
