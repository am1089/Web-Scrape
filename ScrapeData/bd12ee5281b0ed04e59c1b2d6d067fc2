Verily, they who perform an Agnihotra enter upon a long\nsacrificial session:--the Agnihotra, indeed, is a sacrificial session ensuring\ndeath in old age 1, for people are set free from it either by old age or by\ndeath.\n\n12:4:1:22\\. Here, now, they say, \'If either a team (yukta) were to drive\nthrough, or people were to walk to and fro, between the two fires of such a\none performing an Agnihotra, and (being thus) a performer of a long session,\nwhat rite and what expiation would there be in that case?\' He may, indeed,\nperform an expiation, and also offer an ish _t_ i; but let him disregard it,\nfor he who lays down his two fires doubtless spreads himself all over these\nworlds.\n\n12:4:1:33\\. His Garhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, his Anvaharyapa _k_\nana (or southern fire) the air-world, and his \xc3\x82havaniya yonder (heavenly)\nworld; and freely, indeed, birds, both combined (yukta) and single, pass to\nand fro in these worlds; and even if a whole crowd were to pass through\nbetween his fires, let him know that no harm and no hurt will come to him.\n\n12:4:1:44\\. \'But, surely, there are three unclean animals, a vicious boar, a\nvicious ram 2 and a dog: if any\n\np. 179\n\none of these runs about between (the fires) whilst the Agnihotra-offering is\nput on (the fire), what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?\'\nWell, some poke out the ashes from the Garhapatya, and keep throwing it down\nfrom the \xc3\x82havaniya, with this verse ( _Ri_ g-veda I, 22, 17), \'Here Vish _n_ u\nstrode 1,\' saying, \'Vish _n_ u is the sacrifice: by the sacrifice we thus\ncontinue the sacrifice, and with ashes we bestrew its track.\' But let him not\ndo it in this way, for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, \'Surely\nthis (priest) has scattered about 2 the Sacrificer\'s ashes: he will soon\nscatter his last ashes, the chief\'s household will be wailing,\' then that\nwould indeed be likely to come to pass.\n\n12:4:1:55\\. Let him proceed in this way:--Having taken either a bowl of water,\nor a pot of water, let him go on pouring it out from in front of the\nGarhapatya up to the \xc3\x82havaniya, with this verse, \'Here Vish _n_ u strode;\' for\nVish _n_ u being the sacrifice, he thus continues the sacrifice by the\nsacrifice; and whatever is injured or unpropitiated in the sacrifice, for all\nthat the water is the means of propitiation, and by water, as a means of\npropitiation, he thus propitiates it. Such, then, is the rite performed in\nthat case.\n\n12:4:1:66\\. They also say, \'If any one\'s Agnihotra (milk) were to be spilled\nwhilst he gets it milked, what rite and what expiation would there be in that\n\np. 180\n\ncase?\' Having touched (the spilled milk) with the (formula of) expiation for\nspilling, and poured water on it, let him make offering with what (milk) is\nleft. But if the bowl were to be turned upside down, or if it were to break,\nlet him touch (the spilled milk) with the (formula of) expiation, and, having\npoured water on it, let him make offering with what other (milk) he can\nprocure.\n\n12:4:1:77\\. Now, in case there should be a spilling (of milk), let him touch\nit with, \'It hath been shed, it hath been implanted: birth hath ensued;\' for\nwhen (seed) is shed then it is implanted; and when it is implanted then birth\ntakes place. And, indeed, this (earth) is a womb, and the milk is seed: he\nthus implants seed in that womb, and forthwith that shed seed of him who so\nknows this is born forth. And, indeed, it rains from yonder sky, and herbs and\ntrees are produced here on earth; and seed flows from man and animals, and\ntherefrom everything here is generated: let him therefore know that abundant\nproduction has accrued unto him, that he will be multiplied in offspring and\ncattle, and that he will become more prosperous.\n\n12:4:1:88\\. And in case there should be a breaking (of the vessel), let him\npour out a bowlful or potful of water, and, indeed, whatever is injured or\nunpropitiated in the sacrifice, for all that water is the means of\npropitiation, and by water, as a means of propitiation, he thus propitiates\nit. He does so with these utterances, \'Bhur bhuva _h_ svar (earth, air, sky);\'\nfor these utterances are all-expiatory 1:\n\np. 181\n\nhe thus makes expiation with all this (universe). Having collected the\npotsherds let him throw them to where the ashes have been removed. This, then,\nis the rite performed in that case.\n\n12:4:1:99\\. They also say, \'If any one\'s Agnihotra-cow were to lie down whilst\nbeing milked, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?\' Well,\nsome make her get up by means of the Ya _g_ us-formula, \'The divine Aditi hath\nrisen,\'--Aditi, doubtless, is this (earth):--thus saying, \'It is this (earth)\nwe thus raise for him;\'--\'life hath she bestowed upon the lord of sacrifice,\'\nthereby saying,--\'It is life we thus bestow upon this (Sacrificer);\'\\--\'giving\nunto Indra his share,\' thereby saying, \'It is Indra\'s power we thus bestow\nupon him;\'--\'and unto Mitra and Varu _n_ a,\'--Mitra and Varu _n_ a, doubtless,\nare the in-breathing and the up-breathing:--thus saying, \'It is the in and up-\nbreathing we thus bestow upon him.\' At this offering he should present that\n(cow) to a Brahma _n_ a whom he does not intend to visit 1\\--(thus they\nenjoin) saying, \'It was, indeed, after perceiving the Sacrificer\'s suffering\nand evil that she lay down: we thus fasten the suffering and evil on this\n(Brahma _n_ a) 2.\'\n\np. 182\n\n12:4:1:1010\\. But on this point Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said, \'Surely, the cow\nturns from them as from faithless ones, and they smite the offering with\ntrouble; let him rather do it in this way:--Let him make her get up by pushing\nher with a staff.\' And, indeed, as in the case of one driving about here, Ibis\nhorse, or his mule, or his ox yoked (to the car) might become weary, and, by\nits being urged forward by means of a staff or a goad, he completes the way he\nwishes to accomplish, even so does he, by that (cow) being urged forward by\nmeans of a staff or a goad, attain that heavenly world which he desires to\nreach.\n\n12:4:1:1111\\. And \xc3\x82ru _n_ i, indeed, said, \'His Agnihotra-cow, assuredly, is\nthe sky, her calf is that blowing (wind), and the Agnihotra-vessel is this\n(earth). And, verily, the Agnihotra-cow of him who knows this does not perish,\nfor how could yonder (sky) perish? Neither does the calf of the Agnihotra-cow\nof him who knows this perish, for how could that (wind) perish? Nor does the\nAgnihotra-vessel of him who knows this break to pieces, for how could this\n(earth) break to pieces? The rain-cloud showers down blessings: let him\ntherefore think, "Unable to bear my glory and greatness, she (the Agnihotra-\ncow) has lain down: I shall become more glorious." Let him keep her for\nhimself 1: he thereby takes glory (prosperity) to himself,\'--thus spake \xc3\x82ru\n_n_ i. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.\n\n12:4:1:1212\\. They also say, \'If any one\'s Agnihotra-cow were to low whilst he\ngets it milked, what rite and\n\np. 183\n\nwhat expiation would there be in that case?\' Let him pluck a bunch of grass\nand make her eat thereof. This is the rite performed in that case.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[178:1](sbe44058.htm#fr_506) Literally, as would seem, \'old-age-deathed\'\n(garamarva), or perhaps, \'having old age for its extreme limit (marya).\' The\nauthor apparently takes it in the former sense, though interpreting the\ncompound in his own way.\n\n[178:2](sbe44058.htm#fr_507) According to Molesworth\'s Dictionary, \'e _d_ aka\'\nand \'me _m_ _dh_ a,\' in Mara _th_ i, mean both \'ram,\' but the former \'is\nordinarily understood p. 179 of a ram trained to fight, or suffered to live\nlong enough to obtain horns.\'\n\n[179:1](sbe44058.htm#fr_508) See III, 5, 3, 13.\n\n[179:2](sbe44058.htm#fr_509) ? Or, thrown in (viz. into the pot, or urn).\nAccording to \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_ hy. IV, 5, 1 seqq., it is, however, only the\nbones which are collected and placed in the urn.\n\n[180:1](sbe44058.htm#fr_510) Or, perhaps,--these (great) utterances are used\nwith the \'Sarvapraya _s_ _k_ ittam\' (libation for expiating every mistake).\nAccording to Katy. XXV, I, 10, five verses are also to be muttered after p.\n181 the libation with the three \'great words.\' As regards the libation itself,\nit is to be made in the Garhapatya with \'bhu _h_ ,\' in the Dakshi _n_ agni\nwith \'bhuva _h_ ,\' and in the \xc3\x82havaniya with \'Sva _h_ \'; cf. ib. sutra 13.\n\n[181:1](sbe44058.htm#fr_511) The commentators on Katy. XXV, 1, 15 are divided\nin interpretation of this passage; whilst some take it in the above (and most\nnatural) sense, others take it to mean--to the Brahma _n_ a who will not be\ncoming again to his (the Sacrificer\'s) house.\n\n[181:2](sbe44058.htm#fr_512) The reason why a Brahman is thus chosen to serve\nas scapegoat doubtless is that his holy nature is supposed to be proof against\nsuch evil influences (cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, p. 64).\n\n[182:1](sbe44058.htm#fr_513) That is, he is not to give the cow to a Brahma\n_n_ a; cf. Katy. XXV, 1, 27.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 4, 2.
