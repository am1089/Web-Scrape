It has a secondary sense, on account of impossibility and of the text.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that in passages such as 'From that Self there\nsprang Ether.' the origination of Ether is not to be taken in its literal\nsense; for according to the _Kh_ andogya-text 'it sent forth fire.' Brahman\nengaged in creation first produces fire, and fire thus having the first place,\nthe text cannot possibly mean to say that Ether also was produced. Moreover,\nthere is another text, viz.'Vayu and antariksha (i.e. Ether), this is the\nImmortal,' according to which Ether is immortal, i. e. non-produced.--But how\ncan one and the same word viz. it 'sprang' (i.e. originated), be taken in a\nmetaphorical sense with reference to Ether, and in its literal sense with\nreference to fire, and so on?--To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
