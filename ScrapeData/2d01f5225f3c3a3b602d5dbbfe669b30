That great self is signified by these synonymous terms--the great\nself, intelligence, Vish _n_ u 3, Gishnu, Sambhu, the valiant, the\nunderstanding, means of knowledge, means of perception, and likewise\ncognition, courage, memory. Knowing that (great self), a learned Brahma _n_ a\ncomes not by delusion. It has hands and feet on all sides 4, it has eyes,\nheads, and faces on all sides; it stands pervading everything in the world 5.\nThe being of great power is stationed in the heart of all. Minuteness 6,\nlightness, (the power of) obtaining (everything) (are his); he is the\ngovernor, the light, inexhaustible. Now people who comprehend the\nunderstanding, and who are always possessed of a good heart, who practice\nmeditation, who are constant at concentration of mind, who are true to their\npromises, and whose senses are subdued, who are possessed of knowledge, who\nare not avaricious, who have subdued wrath, whose minds are clear, who are\ntalented, who are devoid of (the thought that this or that is) mine, who are\ndevoid of egoism,\n\np. 333\n\nthese being emancipated, attain greatness [1](sbe0853.htm#fn_1620). And the\ntalented man who understands that high and holy goal, the great self\n[2](sbe0853.htm#fn_1621), he among all people comes not by delusion. The self-\nexistent Vish _n_ u is the Lord in the primary creations\n[3](sbe0853.htm#fn_1622). And he who thus knows the lord lying in the cave\n[4](sbe0853.htm#fn_1623), the transcendent, ancient being, of universal form,\nand golden [5](sbe0853.htm#fn_1624), the highest goal of those possessed of\nunderstanding, that talented man, abides transcending the understanding\n[6](sbe0853.htm#fn_1625).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[332:1](sbe0852.htm#fr_1621) I. e. the understanding, on which see Sa _n_\nkhya-sutra I, 61-64.
