Him followed then  \nHis son Mandhata, king of men.  \nHis son was blest in high emprise,  \nSusandhi, fortunate and wise.  \nTwo noble sons had he, to wit  \nDhruvasandhi and Prasenajit.  \nBharat was Dhruvasandhi's son,  \nAnd glorious fame that monarch won.  \nThe warrior Asit he begot.  \nAsit had warfare, fierce and hot,  \nWith rival kings in many a spot,  \nHaihayas, Talajanghas styled,  \nAnd S'as'ivindus, strong and wild.  \nLong time he strove, but forced to yield  \nFled from his kingdom and the field.  \nWith his two wives away he fled  \nWhere high Himalaya lifts his head,  \nAnd, all his wealth and glory past,  \nHe paid the dues of Fate at last.  \nThe wives he left had both conceived--  \nSo is the ancient tale believed--  \nOne, of her rival's hopes afraid  \nFell poison in her viands laid.  \nIt chanced that Chyavan, Bhrigu's child,  \nHad wandered to that pathless wild,  \nAnd there Himalaya's lovely height  \nDetained him with a strange delight.  \nThere came the other widowed queen,  \nWith lotus eyes and beauteous mien,  \nLonging a noble son to bear,  \nAnd wooed the saint with earnest prayer.  \nWhen thus Kalindi,  1 fairest dame,  \nWith reverent supplication came,  \nTo her the holy sage replied:  \n'Born with the poison from thy side,  \nO happy Queen, shall spring ere long  \nAn infant fortunate and strong.  \nThen weep no more, and check thy sighs,  \nSweet lady of the lotus eyes.'  \nThe queen, who loved her perished lord,  \nFor meet reply, the saint adored,  \nAnd, of her husband long bereaved,  \nShe bore a son by him conceived.  \nBecause her rival mixed the bane  \n\np. 82  \n\nTo render her conception vain,  \nAnd fruit unripened to destroy,  \nSagar  [1](ry071.htm#fn_249) she called her darling boy.  \nTo Sagar Asamanj was heir:  \nBright Ans'uman his consort bare.  \nAns'uman's son, Dilipa famed,  \nBegot a son Bhagirath named.  \nFrom him the great Kakutstha rose:  \nFrom him came Raghu, feared by foes,  \nOf him sprang Purushadak bold,  \nFierce hero of gigantic mould:  \nKalmashapada's name he bore,  \nBecause his feet were spotted o'er.  [2](ry071.htm#fn_250)  \nFrom him came S'ankan, and from him  \nSudars'an, fair in face and limb.  \nFrom beautiful Sudars'an came  \nPrince Agnivarna, bright as flame.  \nHis son was S'ighraga, for speed  \nUnmatched; and Maru was his seed.  \nPras'u\xc2\x9cs'ruka was Maru's child;  \nHis son was Ambarisha styled.  \nNahush was Ambarisha's heir,  \nThe mighty lord of regions fair:  \nNahush begot Yayati: he,  \nNabhag of happy destiny.  \nSon of Nabhag was Aja: his,  \nThe glorious Das'aratha is,  \nWhose noble children boast to be  \nRama and Lakshman, whom we see.  \nThus do those kings of purest race  \nTheir lineage from Ikshvaku trace;  \nTheir hero lives the right maintained,  \nTheir lips with falsehood ne'er were stained.  \nIn Rama's and in Lakshman's name  \nThy daughters as their wives I claim,  \nSo shall in equal bands be tied  \nEach peerless youth with peerless bride.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[81:1](ry070.htm#fr_248) A different lady from the Goddess of the Jumna who\nbears the same name.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXXI.: Janak's Pedigree.](ry071.htm)\n\n"
