Thus be\nadoration to thee!\n\n3 3. He then enters (the court) with (the words), '(May) the court and the\nassembly, the two unanimous\n\np. 363\n\ndaughters of Pra _g_ apati (protect me). May one who does not know me, be\nbelow me. May (all) people be considerate in what they say.'\n\n4\\. When he has arrived at the assembly, he should murmur, 'Superior (to my\nadversaries) I have come hither, brilliant, not to be contradicted.
