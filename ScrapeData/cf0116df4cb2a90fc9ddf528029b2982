He observes the fast thinking, 'To-day is the day of new moon 4;'\nand then that (moon) is seen in\n\np. 10\n\nthe west. But, indeed, he (the moon) is that heavenly dog: he watches the\nSacrificer's cattle (to seize them), and that would not be good for cattle if\namends were not made to them 1; and through fear of that 'down-coming moon 2,'\nas they think him to be,--\n\n11:1:5:22\\. They steal away into the shade. And therefore, indeed, people call\nthat burning pain ' _s_ valu _k_ ita' (dog's clutch);--and therefore they also\ncall that one--\n\n11:1:5:33\\. 'The hare in the moon 3.' Soma, the food of the gods, indeed, is\nthe moon: at full moon they press him; and in the subsequent half of the month\nhe enters the waters and plants; and, the cattle feeding on the water and the\nplants, he then during that night (of new moon) collects him from the cattle.\n\n11:1:5:44\\. He keeps the fast thinking, 'To-day is the day of new moon;' and\nthen that (moon) is seen in the west, and the Sacrificer departs from the path\nof sacrifice. As to this they say, 'What should one do when he has departed\nfrom the path of the sacrifice? Should he sacrifice, or should he not\nsacrifice?' He should certainly sacrifice, for there is no other way out of\nit: day after day that (moon) rises larger. Having performed offering after\nthe manner of the New-moon sacrifice, he takes out material for an additional\noffering either on the same, or on the following day.\n\n11:1:5:55\\. There are three chief oblations for this (offering),--(he\nprepares) a cake on eight potsherds for\n\np. 11\n\n[paragraph continues] Agni Pathik _ri_ t (the path-maker), one on eleven\npotsherds for Indra V _ri_ trahan (the slayer of V _ri_ tra), and a cake on\ntwelve potsherds for Agni Vai _s_ vanara.\n\n11:1:5:66\\. Now as to why he prepares (an oblation) for Agni Pathik _ri_ t,--\nit is that Agni, being the maker of the path, leads the Sacrificer (back) to\nthe path of sacrifice, from which he now departs.\n\n11:1:5:77\\. And as to why to Indra V _ri_ trahan,--V _ri_ tra is sin: with the\nhelp of Indra, the slayer of V _ri_ tra, he thus slays sin, V _ri_ tra, which\never keeps him from well-being, from virtue, and from the good work: this is\nwhy he (offers) to Indra V _ri_ trahan.\n\n11:1:5:88\\. And as to why he prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for Agni Vai\n_s_ vanara,--when Indra had slain V _ri_ tra, he burnt him completely by means\nof Agni Vai _s_ vanara, and thereby burnt all his (V _ri_ tra's) sin; and in\nlike manner does that (Sacrificer) now, after slaying sin, V _ri_ tra, with\nthe help of Indra V _ri_ trahan, burn him, and all that sin of his, by means\nof Agni Vai _s_ vanara; and, verily, not the slightest sin remains in him who,\nknowing this, performs this offering.\n\n11:1:5:99\\. For this (offering) there are seventeen kindling-verses. He offers\nto the deities in a low voice, and makes any (verses) he pleases his\ninvitatory and offering-formulas. In like manner (those of) the two butter-\nportions and the two formulas of the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n11:1:5:1010\\. A bow with three arrows he gives as dakshi _n_ a; for with the\nbow a dog is driven away: he thus drives away that (dog, the moon) when he\ngives a bow with three arrows as dakshi _n_ a.\n\n11:1:5:1111\\. A staff he gives as dakshi _n_ a; for with a staff\n\np. 12\n\na dog is driven away: he thus drives away that (dog) when he gives a staff as\ndakshi _n_ a. This, indeed, is the prescribed dakshi _n_ a; but he may give\nanything else besides, of such other (objects meet for) dakshi _n_ as as may\nbe at his disposal. This, doubtless, is an offering relating to cattle: he may\nperform it even though (the moon) was not seen (at his New-moon sacrifice).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[9:4](sbe44007.htm#fr_96) Amavasya, lit. the night of their (the sun and\nmoon's) staying together.\n\n[10:1](sbe44007.htm#fr_97) Apraya _s_ _k_ ittik _ri_ te (or -k _ri_ ta _h_\n),--? in the case of (the owner) who did not make amends to, and quiet, them.\n\n[10:2](sbe44007.htm#fr_98) Avak _ri_ sh _t_ o nik _ri_ sh _t_ a _s_ _k_\nandrama ava _k_ andramasa _h_ , Say.\n\n[10:3](sbe44007.htm#fr_99) Saya _n_ a takes this to mean that for this reason\nthe moon is called ' _s_ a _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85ka,' 'he who is marked with a hare.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 1, 6.
