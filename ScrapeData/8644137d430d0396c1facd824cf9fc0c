The Nyagrodha, the _G_ ambu, the Pippala, and likewise the\n_S_ almali, the Sin _s_ apa, and the. Meshas _ri_ _n_ ga, and likewise the\nbamboo and willow 2; these are the princes among trees in this world, there is\nno doubt of that. The Himavat, the Pariyatra, the Sahya, the Vindhya, the\nTriku _t_ avat, the _S_ veta, the Nila, the Bhasa, and the Kosh _th_ avat\nmountain, the Mahendra, the Guruskandha; and likewise the Malyavat mountain,\nthese are the princes among mountains 3. Likewise the Maruts are (the princes)\namong the Ga _n_ as; the sun is the prince among the planets, and the moon 4\namong the Nakshatras; Yama is the prince among the Pit _ri_ s, and the ocean\namong rivers; Varu _n_ a is the king of the waters, and Indra is said to be\n(the king) of the Maruts. Arka is the king of hot (bodies), and Indu is said\nto be (the king) of shining bodies. Fire is ever the lord of the elements 5,\nand B _ri_ haspati of Brahma _n_ as; Soma is the lord of herbs, Vish _n_ u is\nthe chief among the strong; Tvash _tri_ is the prince\n\np. 347\n\nof the Rudras, and _S_ iva is the ruler of (all) creatures; likewise,\nsacrifice of (all) initiatory ceremonies 1, and Maghavat 2 likewise of the\ngods; the north among the quarters, and among all vipras the powerful king\nSoma 3; Kubera (is lord) of all jewels, Purandara of (all) deities. Such is\nthe highest creation among all entities. Pra _g_ apati (is lord) of all\npeoples; and of all entities whatever I, who am full of the Brahman, and\ngreat, (am lord). There is no higher being than myself or Vish _n_ u. The\ngreat Vish _n_ u full of the Brahman is the king of kings over all. Understand\nhim to be the ruler, the creator, the uncreated Hari. For he is the ruler of\nmen, Kinnaras, and Yakshas; of Gandharvas, snakes, and Rakshases; of gods,\ndemons, and Nagas. Among all those who are followed by (men) full of desires,\n(the chief) is 4 the great goddess Mahe _s_ vari, who has beautiful eyes. She\nis called Parvati. Know the goddess Uma 5 to be the best and (most) holy of\n(all) females. Among women who are (a source 6 of) happiness, likewise, the\nbrilliant 7 Apsarases (are chief). Kings desire\n\np. 348\n\npiety; and Brahma _n_ as are the bridges 1 of piety. Therefore a king should\nalways endeavour to protect the twice-born 2. Those kings in whose dominions\ngood men lie low, lose all their qualifications 3, and go into wrong paths\nafter death. But those high-souled kings in whose dominions good men are\nprotected, rejoice in this world, and attain the infinite (seat) after death.\nUnderstand this, O chiefs of the twice-born! I shall now proceed to state the\ninvariable characteristics of piety. Non-destruction is the highest piety 4,\nand destruction is of the nature of impiety. Enlightenment 5 is the\ncharacteristic of gods; action 6 the characteristic of men; sound is the\ncharacteristic of space; (the sensation of) touch is the characteristic of\nair; colour is the characteristic of light; taste is the characteristic of\nwater; the characteristic of earth, the supporter of all beings, is smell;\nwords are the characteristic of speech 7 refined into vowels and consonants;\nthe characteristic of mind is thought. Likewise as to what is described here\nas understanding, a determination\n\np. 349\n\nis here formed by (that) understanding about objects which have been thought\nover by the mind 1. And there is no doubt of this that determination is the\ncharacteristic of the understanding. The characteristic of mind is meditation\n2; and the characteristic of a good man is (living) unperceived 3. The\ncharacteristic of devotion is action 4; and knowledge, the characteristic of\nrenunciation. Therefore a man of understanding should practice renunciation,\ngiving prominence to knowledge 5. The renouncer possessed of knowledge attains\nthe highest goal. And crossing beyond darkness, and transcending death and old\nage, he repairs to that which has no second 6. Thus have I duly spoken to you\nconcerning the characteristic of piety. I will now proceed to explain properly\nthe comprehension 7 of the qualities. As to the smell of the earth, verily,\nthat is comprehended by the nose; and the wind 8 likewise residing in the nose\nis a pointed 9 to the knowledge of smell. Taste 10,\n\np. 350\n\nthe essence of water, is always comprehended by the tongue. And the moon\nlikewise, who resides in the tongue, is appointed to the knowledge of taste.\nThe quality of light is colour, and that is comprehended by the eye; and the\nsun residing in the eye is appointed always to the knowledge of colour. The\n(sensation of) touch, belonging to the air, is perceived by the skin, and the\nwind 1 residing in the skin is always appointed to the knowledge of (the\nobjects) of touch. The quality of space is sound, and that is comprehended by\nthe ear. And all the quarters residing in the ear are celebrated as (being\nappointed) to the knowledge of sound. Thought is the quality of mind, and that\nis comprehended by the understanding. The supporter of consciousness 2\nresiding in the heart is appointed to the knowledge of mind 3. The\nunderstanding (is comprehended in the form of) determination, and the Mahat 4\nof knowledge. To (this) positive comprehension, the unperceived 5 (is\nappointed), there is no doubt of that. The Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a, which is in its\nessence devoid of qualities and eternal, is not to be comprehended by any\n\np. 351\n\nsymbols. Therefore the characteristic of the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a, which is void of\nsymbols 1, is purely knowledge. The unperceived is stated to be the Kshetra 2\nin which the qualities are produced and absorbed. And I always see, know, and\nhear it, (though) concealed. The Purusha knows it, therefore is he called\nKshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a 3. And the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a likewise perceives all the operations\nof the qualities 4. The qualities created again and again, do not know\nthemselves 5, being nonintelligent, to be created and tied down to a\nbeginning, middle, and end 6. Only the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a attains, no one, (else)\nattains, to the truth, which is great, transcendent, and beyond the qualities\nand the entities (produced) 7 from the qualities. Hence a man who understands\npiety, abandoning qualities, and the creation 8, in this world, and\ntranscending the qualities, and having his sins destroyed, then enters into\nthe Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a. One who is free from the pairs of opposites, free from the\nceremony of salutations, and\n\np. 352\n\nfrom the svaha ceremony [1](sbe0856.htm#fn_1749), who is unmoving, and\nhomeless [2](sbe0856.htm#fn_1750), is the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a, he is the Supreme\nLord.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[345:1](sbe0854.htm#fr_1709) I. e. creating or acting, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra. I\nthink it probable that it was meant to go with the preceding words. See Gita,\n[p. 83](sbe0811.htm#page_83) note; but, for this, 'changing' must be in the\naccusative. It is in the nominative. As the original stands, and on Ar _g_ una\nMi _s_ ra's interpretation, the sense seems to be that when he is about to\nengage fin the work of creation, he can obtain as many bodies as he likes.\nNilaka _nth_ a compares _Kh_ andogya, p. 526. And see pp.\n[249](sbe0831.htm#page_249), [327](sbe0850.htm#page_327) supra. Can always\nperceive = invariably obtains when he wishes.\n\n[345:2](sbe0854.htm#fr_1710) Cf. Gita, pp. [83](sbe0811.htm#page_83),\n[93](sbe0813.htm#page_93), and note  [1](sbe0813.htm#fn_388) there.\n\n[345:3](sbe0854.htm#fr_1711) Cf. Gita, pp. [85](sbe0811.htm#page_85),\n[118](sbe0819.htm#page_118).\n\n[345:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1712) I. e. passion--that quality--is dominant in the\nKshatriya, Nilaka _nth_ a. See [p. 329](sbe0851.htm#page_329) supra.\n\n[345:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1713) Commenting on Gita V, 18 ([p.\n65](sbe0807.htm#page_65)) _S_ a _n_ kara calls the elephant atyantatamasa,\nbelonging entirely to the quality of darkness.\n\n[346:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1714) As to the constructions here, cf. generally Gita,\n[p. 88](sbe0812.htm#page_88), and see the remarks of Ramanu _g_ a and _S_\nridhara on Gita X, 21. The meaning here is, of course, the male is ruler over\nfemales.\n\n[346:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1715) I do not know what distinction is intended\nbetween these two. Generally ki _k_ aka is used for the hollow bamboo, which\nwhistles when the wind blows through it.\n\n[346:3](sbe0855.htm#fr_1716) Some of these mountains are mentioned in Pata\xc3\xb1\n_g_ ali. See Introduction.\n\n[346:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1717) This list may be compared with that at Gita,\nchapter X. Sometimes the same object occurs more than once with reference to\nmore than one class; thus the moon occurs as lord of Nakshatras, of shining\nbodies, and of herbs--unless Soma there stands for the Soma plant. See Gita,\n[p. 113](sbe0817.htm#page_113). Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says expressly that the\nmoon occurs more than once as the correlatives, the classes with reference to\nwhich she is mentioned, are different. In such cases I have kept the original\nnames untranslated; Arka = sun; Indu = moon.\n\n[346:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1718) Cf. Ka _th_ a, p. 83.\n\n[347:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1719) This must mean, I presume, that the sacrifice is\nhigher than the initiation, as male than female, see [p.\n316](sbe0847.htm#page_316), note  [1](sbe0847.htm#fn_1512).\n\n[347:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1720) This is another repetition. Indra has been\nmentioned before, and Purandara is mentioned further on.\n\n[347:3](sbe0855.htm#fr_1721) As to king Soma, see inter alia B _ri_ hadara _n_\nyaka, p. 237; _Kh_ andogya, p. 342, where _S_ a _n_ kara explains 'king' by\nadding 'of Brahma _n_ as.' Vipras = Brahmanas.\n\n[347:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1722) I. e. Mahe _s_ vari is the most beautiful of\nwomankind.\n\n[347:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1723) It is well known that Uma, Parvati, Mahe _s_ vari\nare names of the consort of the third member of the Hindu Trinity; see Kena,\np. 13, and _S_ a _n_ kara's comment there. See, too, Muir, Sanskrit Texts,\nvol. iv, p. 421, and Taittiriya-aranyaka, p. 839.\n\n[347:6](sbe0855.htm#fr_1724) The idea of 'source' is supplied by Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra.\n\n[347:7](sbe0855.htm#fr_1725) Literally, 'rich.' Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra\nparaphrases it by ' _G_ yotishmati.' Nilaka _nth_ a's explanation here is not\nquite clear.\n\n[348:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1726) I. e. instrumental in piety, or guides to piety.\nCf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 370; Mu _nd_ aka, p. 297.\n\n[348:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1727) So literally, doubtless Brahma _n_ as only are\nintended here.\n\n[348:3](sbe0855.htm#fr_1728) I. e., I presume, they lose all their merits,\ntheir good points are destroyed by this dereliction of duty.\n\n[348:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1729) Cf. [p. 291](sbe0840.htm#page_291) supra. Ar _g_\nuna Mi _s_ ra begins a fresh chapter with 'I shall now,' &c.\n\n[348:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1730) Knowledge of the truth, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[348:6](sbe0855.htm#fr_1731) I. e. action performed for the purpose of\nobtaining the fruit of it. The next five items refer to the five elements and\ntheir characteristic properties. Nilaka _nth_ a's explanation, that all these\nare merely parallels not stated for their own relevancy here, but as\nillustrations, seems to be the only available one.\n\n[348:7](sbe0855.htm#fr_1732) I. e. the learning of other people, Nilaka _nth_\na. The meaning seems to be that we know speech only in its manifestation in\nthe form of words.\n\n[349:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1733) The text here is rather unsatisfactory; I have\nadopted that which I find in the copy containing Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's\ncommentary.\n\n[349:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1734) Frequent pondering on matters learnt from _S_\nastras or common life, Nilaka _nth_ a. Why mind comes twice the commentators\ndo not explain.\n\n[349:3](sbe0855.htm#fr_1735) Does this refer to, what is said at Sanatsu _g_\natiya, [p. 159](sbe0823.htm#page_159).\n\n[349:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1736) Devotion means here, as in the Gita, action\nwithout desire of fruits. For action the word here is the same as at Gita, [p.\n115](sbe0818.htm#page_115), note  [2](sbe0823.htm#fn_644).\n\n[349:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1737) Cf. Gita, [p. 52](sbe0804.htm#page_52), note\n[7](sbe0805.htm#fn_157).\n\n[349:6](sbe0855.htm#fr_1738) This is Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's interpretation,\nand appears to me to be correct. Nilaka _nth_ a's is different, but seems to\nomit all account of abhyeti, repairs.'\n\n[349:7](sbe0855.htm#fr_1739) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's interpretation seems to be\ndifferent, but our copy is not quite intelligible.\n\n[349:8](sbe0855.htm#fr_1740) See [p. 337](sbe0854.htm#page_337) supra. The\nwind is the presiding deity of the nasal organ.\n\n[349:9](sbe0855.htm#fr_1741) I. e. that is its function. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra\nsays, 'it is pondered on,' which is not clear.\n\n[349:10](sbe0855.htm#fr_1742) Cf. Gita, [p. 74](sbe0809.htm#page_74), as to\ntaste and water.\n\n[350:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1743) This cannot be the presiding deity here, though\none expects such deity to be mentioned; see [p. 337](sbe0854.htm#page_337)\nsupra.\n\n[350:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1744) The text of more than one of the lines here is\nrather doubtful; we follow Nilaka _nth_ a, who takes this to mean the _g_ iva,\nthe individual soul. Cf. [p. 239](sbe0829.htm#page_239), note\n[2](sbe0829.htm#fn_1095) supra.\n\n[350:3](sbe0855.htm#fr_1745) I. e. thought, as Nilaka _nth_ a points out.\n\n[350:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1746) Mahat is properly the same as buddhi,\nunderstanding, but as it is here mentioned separately, I suppose, it signifies\nAha _n_ kara. Nilaka _nth_ a takes its operation, here called knowledge, to\nmean 'the feeling I am,' which agrees with our interpretation, for which some\nsupport is also to be derived from [p. 333](sbe0852.htm#page_333) supra.\n\n[350:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1747) I here follow Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, though\nsomewhat diffidently. The knowledge 'this is I,' and the knowledge 'this is so\nand so and nothing else' is presided over by the unperceived--the Prakriti.\n\n[351:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1748) See Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p.\n146](sbe0821.htm#page_146). See also [p. 309](sbe0846.htm#page_309) supra.\n\n[351:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1749) See Gita, [p. 102](sbe0814.htm#page_102) seq.\n\n[351:3](sbe0855.htm#fr_1750) I. e. he who knows the Kshetra.\n\n[351:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1751) Enlightenment, activity, and delusion, Nilaka\n_nth_ a.\n\n[351:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1752) I. e. do not know the self, Nilaka _nth_ a;\nbetter, I think, the qualities do not know themselves, only the Kshetra _g_ \xc3\xb1a\nknows them.' Cf. _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 194, st. 41.\n\n[351:6](sbe0855.htm#fr_1753) I. e. production, existence, and destruction,\nNilaka _nth_ a. This must, however, mean their manifestation, continuance, and\ndissolution in any particular form. For the prak _ri_ ti, which is made up of\nthe three qualities, is beginningless. Cf. Gita, [p.\n104](sbe0815.htm#page_104).\n\n[351:7](sbe0855.htm#fr_1754) I. e. the actual physical manifestations, as we\nmay say, of the qualities.\n\n[351:8](sbe0855.htm#fr_1755) The original, sattva, Nilaka _nth_ a renders by\nbuddhi, and qualities by visible objects. In the familiar Sa _n_ khya phrase\nsattvapurushanyatapratyaya sattva means creation, or what is other than\npurusha (cf. Sa _n_ khyatattvakaumudi, pp. 9-144). That is the meaning here.\nSee too [p. 371](sbe0859.htm#page_371) infra, and _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha\nDharma), chap. 194, st. 38 seq. and comments there.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXIX](sbe0856.htm)\n\n"
