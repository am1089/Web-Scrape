Verily he who knows the babe 3 with his place 4, his chamber 5, his post\n6, and his rope 7, he keeps off the seven relatives 8 who hate him. Verily by\nthe young is meant the inner life, by his place this (body) 9, by his chamber\nthis (head), by his post the vital breath, by his rope the food.\n\n2\\. Then the seven imperishable ones 10 approach him. There are the red lines\nin the eye, and by them Rudra clings to him. There is the water\n\np. 106\n\nin the eye, and by it Par _g_ anya clings to him. There is the pupil, and by\nit \xc3\x82ditya (sun) clings to him, There is the dark iris, and by it Agni clings\nto him. There is the white eye-ball, and by it Indra, clings to him. With the\nlower eye-lash the earth, with the upper eye-lash the heaven clings to him. He\nwho knows this, his food does never perish.\n\n3\\. On this there is this _S_ loka:\n\n'There 1 is a cup having its mouth below and its bottom above. Manifold glory\nhas been placed into it. On its lip sit the seven _Ri_ shis, the tongue as the\neighth communicates with Brahman.' What is called the cup having its mouth\nbelow and its bottom above is this head, for its mouth (the mouth) is below,\nits bottom (the skull) is above. When it is said that manifold glory has been\nplaced into it, the senses verily are manifold glory, and he therefore means\nthe senses. When he says that the seven _Ri_ shis sit on its lip, the _Ri_\nshis are verily the (active) senses, and he means the senses. And when he says\nthat the tongue as the eighth communicates with Brahman, it is because the\ntongue, as the eighth, does communicate with Brahman.\n\n4\\. These two (the two ears) are the _Ri_ shis Gautama and Bharadva _g_ a; the\nright Gautama, the left Bharadva _g_ a. These two (the eyes) are the _Ri_ shis\nVi _s_ vamitra and _G_ amadagni; the right Vi _s_ vamitra, the left _G_\namadagni. These two (the nostrils) are the _Ri_ shis Vasish _th_ a and Ka _s_\nyapa; the right Vasish _th_ a, the left Ka _s_ yapa. The tongue is Atri, for\nwith the tongue food is eaten, and Atri is meant for Atti, eating. He who\nknows this, becomes an eater of everything, and everything becomes his food.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[105:2](sbe15059.htm#fr_327) Madhyandina text, p. 1061.\n\n[105:3](sbe15059.htm#fr_328) The li\xe1\xb9\x85gatman, or subtle body which has entered\nthis body in five ways.
