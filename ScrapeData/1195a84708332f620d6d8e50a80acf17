XII.\n\nIndra comes to Gokula: praises Krishn\xcc\x81a, and makes him prince over the cattle.\nKrishn\xcc\x81a promises to befriend Arjuna.\n\nAFTER Gokula had been saved by the elevation of the mountain, Indra became\ndesirous of beholding Krishn\xcc\x81a. The conqueror of his foes accordingly mounted\nhis vast elephant Airavata, and came to Govarddhana, where the king of the\ngods beheld the mighty Damodara tending cattle, and assuming the person of a\ncow-boy, and, although the preserver of the whole world, surrounded by the\nsons of the herdsmen: above his head he saw Garud\xcc\x81a, the king of birds,\ninvisible to mortals, spreading out his wings to shade the head of Hari.\nAlighting from his elephant, and addressing him apart, \xc5\x9aakra, his eyes\nexpanding with pleasure, thus spake to Madhusudana: "Hear, Krishn\xcc\x81a, the\nreason why I have come hither; why I have approached thee; for thou couldest\nnot otherwise conceive it. Thou, who art the supporter of all, hast descended\nupon earth, to relieve her of her burden. In resentment of my obstructed rites\nI sent the clouds to deluge Gokula, and they have done this evil deed. Thou,\nby raising up the mountain, hast preserved the cattle; and of a verity I am\nmuch pleased, O hero, with thy wondrous deed. The object of the gods is now,\nmethinks, accomplished, since with thy single hand thou hast raised aloft this\nchief of mountains. I have now come by desire of the cattle 1, grateful for\ntheir preservation, in order to install you as Upendra; and, as the Indra of\nthe cows, thou shalt be called Govinda 2." Having thus said, Mahendra took a\newer from his elephant\n\np. 529\n\n[paragraph continues] Airavata, and with the holy water it contained performed\nthe regal ceremony of aspersion. The cattle, as the rite was celebrating,\ndeluged the earth with their milk.\n\nWhen Indra had, by direction of the kine, inaugurated Krishn\xcc\x81a, the husband of\n\xc5\x9aachi said to him affectionately, "I have thus performed what the cows\nenjoined me. Now, illustrious being, hear what farther I propose, with a view\nto facilitate your task. A portion of me has been born as Arjuna, the son of\nPritha: let him ever be defended by thee, and he will assist thee in bearing\nthy burden. He is to be cherished by thee, Madhusudana, like another self." To\nthis Krishn\xcc\x81a replied, "I know thy son, who has been born in the race of\nBharata, and I will\n\np. 530\n\nbefriend him as long as I continue upon earth. As long as I am present,\ninvincible \xc5\x9aakra, no one shall be able to subdue Arjuna in fight. When the\ngreat demon Kansa has been slain, and Arisht\xcc\x81a, Ke\xc5\x9bin, Kuvalayapid\xcc\x81a, Naraka,\nand other fierce Daityas, shall have been put to death, there will take place\na great war, in which the burden of the earth will be removed. Now therefore\ndepart, and be not anxious on account of thy son; for no foe shall triumph\nover Arjuna whilst I am present. For his sake I will restore to Kunti all her\nsons; with Yudhisht\xcc\x81hira at their head, unharmed, when the Bharata war is at\nan end."\n\nUpon Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s ceasing to speak, he and Indra mutually embraced; and the\nlatter, mounting his elephant Airavata, returned to heaven. Krishn\xcc\x81a, with the\ncattle and the herdsmen, went his way to Vraja, where the wives of the Gopas\nwatched for his approach.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[528:1](vp129.htm#fr_1491) Gobhischa chodita; that is, \'delegated,\' says the\ncommentator, \'by the cow of plenty, Kamadhenu, and other celestial kine,\ninhabitants of Goloka, the heaven of cows:\' but this is evidently unauthorized\nby the text, as celestial cattle could not be grateful for preservation upon\nearth; and the notion of Goloka, a heaven of cows and Krishn\xcc\x81a, is a modern\npiece of mysticism, drawn from such sectarial works as the Brahma Vaivartta P.\nand Hari Van\xc5\x9ba.\n\n[528:2](vp129.htm#fr_1492) The purport of Indra\'s speech is to explain the\nmeaning of two of Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s names, Upendra and Govinda. The commentators on\nthe Amara Kosha agree in p. 529 explaining the first, the younger brother of\nIndra, ### conformably to the synonyme that immediately follows in the text of\nAmara, Indravaraja; a name that occurs also in the Mahabharata: Krishn\xcc\x81a, as\nthe son of Devaki, who is an incarnation of Aditi, being born of the latter\nsubsequently to Indra. Govinda is he who knows, finds, or tends cattle; Gam\nvindati. The Pauran\xcc\x81ik etymology makes the latter the Indra (### quasi ###) of\ncows; and in this capacity he may well be considered as a minor or inferior\nIndra, such being the proper sense of the term Upendra (Upa in composition);\nas, Upa-puran\xcc\x81a, \'a minor Puran\xcc\x81a,\' &c. The proper import of the word Upendra\nhas, however, been anxiously distorted by the sectarian followers of Krishn\xcc\x81a.\nThus the commentator on our text asserts that Upa is here synonymous with\nUpari, and that Upendratwa, \'the station of Upendra,\' means \'rule in the\nheaven of heavens, Goloka;\' a new creation of this sect, above Satya-loka,\nwhich, in the uncorrupt Pauran\xcc\x81ik system, is the highest of the seven Lokas:\nsee [p. 213](vp065.htm#page_213). So the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba makes Indra say, \'As thou,\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, art appointed, by the cows, Indra superior to me, therefore the\ndeities in heaven shall call thee Upendra.\' The Bhagavata does not introduce\nthe name, though it no doubt alludes to it in making the divine cow Surabhi,\nwho is said to have come from Goloka with Indra, address Krishn\xcc\x81a, and say,\n\'We, instructed by Brahma, will crown you as our Indra.\' Accordingly Krishn\xcc\x81a\nhas the water of the Ganges thrown over him by the elephant of Indra, and\nIndra, the gods, and sages praise him, and salute him by the appellation of\nGovinda. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba assigns this to Indra alone, who says, \'I am only the\nIndra of the gods; thou hast attained the rank of Indra of the kine, and they\nshall for ever celebrate thee on earth as Govinda.\' All this is very different\nfrom the sober account of our text, and is undoubtedly of comparatively recent\norigin.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIII](vp130.htm)\n\n'
