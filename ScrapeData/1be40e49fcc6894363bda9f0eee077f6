b"[![](../../cdshop/cdinfo.jpg)](../../cdshop/index.htm)  \n[Sacred Texts](../../index.htm)  [Hinduism](../index.htm)  [Index](index.htm)\n[Previous](sbe0849.htm)  [Next](sbe0851.htm)\n\n* * *\n\n# CHAPTER XXIII.\n\nBrahman said:\n\nNow I shall proceed to describe the third--the best--quality, beneficial to\nall creatures, and unblamable, the duty of the good. joy 7, pleasure,\nnobility, enlightenment and happiness also, absence of stinginess, absence of\nfear, contentment, faith, forgiveness, courage, harmlessness, equability,\ntruth, straightforwardness, absence of wrath, absence of calumniation,\n\np. 326\n\npurity, dexterity, valour. He who possesses the piety of concentration of\nmind, (holding) knowledge to be vain 1, (good) conduct vain, service vain, and\nlabour vain, he attains the highest in the next world. Devoid of (the notion\nthat this or that is) mine, devoid of egoism, devoid of expectations, equable\neverywhere, not full of desires, (to be) such is the eternal duty of the good.\nConfidence, modesty 2, forgiveness, liberality, purity, freedom from laziness,\nabsence of cruelty, freedom from delusion, compassion to (all) creatures,\nabsence of backbiting, joy, contentment, joviality, humility, good behaviour,\npurity in all action for (acquiring) tranquillity 3, righteous feelings,\nemancipation 4, indifference 5, life as a Brahma _k_ arin, abandonment on all\nhands, freedom from (the notion that this or that is) mine, freedom from\nexpectations 6, unbroken piety 7, (holding that) gifts (are) vain, sacrifices\nvain, learning vain, vows vain, receipt of gifts vain, piety vain, penance\nvain. Those talented Brahma _n_ as in this world, whose conduct is of this\ndescription, who adhere to the quality of goodness, abiding in the seat of the\nBrahman 8, perceive (everything) aright. Getting rid of all\n\np. 327\n\nsins, and free from grief, those talented men reach heaven, and create\n(various) bodies 1. The power of governing, self-restraint, minuteness 2,\nthese those high-souled ones make (for themselves) by (the operations of their\nown) minds like the gods dwelling in heaven. They are said to have their\ncurrents upwards 3, and to be gods, and of the quality of goodness 4; and\nhaving gone to heaven they verily change in various ways, by means of nature\n5. They obtain and divide 6 whatever they desire. Thus, O chiefs of the twice-\nborn! have I described to you the conduct of the quality of goodness.\nUnderstanding this according to rule, one obtains whatever one desires. The\nqualities\n\np. 328\n\nof goodness have been specifically described, and the operation of the\nqualities has been accurately stated. The man who always understands these\nqualities, enjoys the qualities [1](sbe0851.htm#fn_1592), but is not attached\nto the qualities.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[325:1](sbe0849.htm#fr_1578) I. e. who are always thinking of what they have\ndone and what they have to do, and so forth. Cf. Gita, pp.\n[115](sbe0818.htm#page_115), [116](sbe0818.htm#page_116).\n\n[325:2](sbe0849.htm#fr_1579) And not that which is higher than these, viz.\nfinal emancipation.\n\n[325:3](sbe0849.htm#fr_1580) See [p. 321](sbe0848.htm#page_321) and note\n[5](sbe0848.htm#fn_1548) there.\n\n[325:4](sbe0849.htm#fr_1581) Cf. inter alia, Gita, [p.\n48](sbe0804.htm#page_48).\n\n[325:5](sbe0849.htm#fr_1582) Viz. heaven. Cf. Gita, [p.\n48](sbe0804.htm#page_48).\n\n[325:6](sbe0849.htm#fr_1583) I. e. offerings to the manes.\n\n[325:7](sbe0850.htm#fr_1584) Cf. [p. 300](sbe0842.htm#page_300) supra, and\nSanti Parvan (Moksha), chap. 194, st. 34; chap. 214, st. 36, For nobility, Ar\n_g_ una Mi _s_ ra has manifestation of joy.\n\n[326:1](sbe0850.htm#fr_1585) Such is Nilaka _nth_ a's reading, and be takes\nknowledge to mean mere knowledge derived from books, &c. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra\nhas a different reading for vain, which he interprets to mean 'wish for\nfruit.'\n\n[326:2](sbe0850.htm#fr_1586) See Sanatsugatiya, [p.\n162](sbe0823.htm#page_162).\n\n[326:3](sbe0850.htm#fr_1587) I. e. pure and straightforward conduct in the\nperformance of whatever is done for attaining final emancipation.\n\n[326:4](sbe0850.htm#fr_1588) Of other people from sorrow, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra.\n\n[326:5](sbe0850.htm#fr_1589) The state of being unconcerned, udasina, Nilaka\n_nth_ a.\n\n[326:6](sbe0850.htm#fr_1590) Cf. Gita, [p. 60](sbe0806.htm#page_60), inter\nalia.\n\n[326:7](sbe0850.htm#fr_1591) Arguna Mi _s_ ra understands the original here to\nmean 'not being under the control of another.'\n\n[326:8](sbe0850.htm#fr_1592) I. e. the source of the Vedas, according to\nNilaka _nth_ a. The Supreme is called Brahmayoni, the original word here, at\n_S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 327 p. 354, where Brahman is rendered to mean Prak\n_ri_ ti by _S_ a _n_ kara. See Sanatsu _g_ atiya, [p.\n186](sbe0826.htm#page_186), note  [6](sbe0826.htm#fn_899), and Taittiriya-ara\n_n_ yaka, p. 894. As to the probable sense here, see [p.\n339](sbe0854.htm#page_339), note  [2](sbe0854.htm#fn_1652) infra.\n\n[327:1](sbe0850.htm#fr_1593) I. e. for themselves. Cf. [p.\n345](sbe0854.htm#page_345) infra; Yoga-sutras, p. 227 and Brihadara _n_ yaka,\np. 849.\n\n[327:2](sbe0850.htm#fr_1594) These include, according to Nilaka _nth_ a, the\nother qualities of the same class unnamed here, for which see Yoga-sutra III,\n44 (p. 207). The power of governing, i. e. producing, destroying, or combining\nworldly objects as one pleases; self-restraint, i. e. in the presence of\ntempting objects; minuteness = power of becoming as minute as one pleases. The\nother qualities are lightness, largeness, and heaviness; power of attracting\neverything so as to be near oneself (e. g. touching the moon with the finger),\npower of obtaining one's wish.\n\n[327:3](sbe0850.htm#fr_1595) Cf. [p. 321](sbe0848.htm#page_321) supra and note\n[5](sbe0848.htm#fn_1548). Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, and Nilaka _nth_ a also, here\nrender it by 'those who go upwards.' As to which, see Gita, [p.\n109](sbe0816.htm#page_109).\n\n[327:4](sbe0850.htm#fr_1596) Cf. for this sense, which is given by Ar _g_ una\nMi _s_ ra, Sa _n_ khyasara, p. 19.\n\n[327:5](sbe0850.htm#fr_1597) Nilaka _nth_ a says this means that they change\ntheir minds for purposes of enjoyment by means of the impression of previous\nenjoyments. The changes, however, seem to be those above referred to-\nminuteness, &c., and the acquisition of other bodies. As to nature, cf. Gita,\npp. [58](sbe0805.htm#page_58) and [112](sbe0817.htm#page_112), with the\ncorrection made at [p. 318](sbe0848.htm#page_318) supra.\n\n[327:6](sbe0850.htm#fr_1598) This is not quite clear. Does it mean distribute\namong themselves or others?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXIV](sbe0851.htm)\n\n"
