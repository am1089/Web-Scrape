Suta said :-- The King Haris\xc2\x92chandra then prepared the funeral pile and\nplaced his son on it. Next he and his wife with folded palms merged themselves\nin the meditation of the Parames\xc2\x92vari, the Lady of of the Universe. That\nHundred-eyed is reigning within these five Ko _s_ as (or sheaths) Annamaya,\netc. She resides in the sacral plexus of the nature of Brahma _n_ , of the\nPuru _s_ a composed of Anna and Rasa. And She is the Ocean of Mercy. Wearing\nthe red robe, She is ever ready with various weapons in Her hands for the\npreservation of the Universe. When the King was engaged thus in meditating on\nHer, Indra and all the Devas with Dharma in their front came to the King\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra with no delay. They all coming up said to the King :-- \xc2\x93O King!\nHear. I am the Grand Sire and here are present Dharma Himself, the Bhagavan Vi\n_sn_ u, the Sadhyas, Vis\xc2\x92vadevas, Maruts, the Lokapalas, the Chara _n_ as, the\nNagas, the Gandharbas, Siddhas, Rudras,\n\n\n\np. 685\n\n\n\nthe twin As\xc2\x92vins, and all the other Devas and Vis\xc2\x92vamitra himself.\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra, who going ever the three worlds wishes to make friendship\naccording to the law ordained by Dharma, is now himself desirous to grant you\nyour desired objects.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n8\\. Dharma said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Do not risk such an hazardous undertaking. I am\nDharma; I am satisfied with your patience and forbearance, control of your\nsenses, and the other Sattvic qualities and have therefore come to you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n9-10. Indra said :-- \xc2\x93O Haris\xc2\x92chandra! I have also come to you. So your good\nfortune knows no bounds today. You with your wife and son have conquered the\nEternal World. O King! What is hardly attainable by any human being, you have\nconquered that, by dint of your own merits. So get up to the Heavens\n(vibrations of the Fourth-dimensional Space) with your wife and son.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n11-16. Suta said :-- Indra then sprinkled over the dead son on the funeral\npiles, the nectar, destroying the fatal effect produced by unnatural death. At\nthat time big showers of flowers were thrown on him and Dundubhis were\nsounded. In the meanwhile, the prince got up from the funeral pile. He got\nback his former beautiful body and he looked peaceful, healthy, and greatly\nsatisfied. Haris\xc2\x92chandra embraced his son instantly in his bosom; the King and\nQueen also both regained their former beautiful appearance at that time and\nwere decked with clothes and garlands. Their hearts were then deeply filled\nwith great joy at their getting back their desired object and their health.\nIndra then said to the King :-- \xc2\x93O Highly Fortunate One! Now ascend to the\nHeavens with your son and wife, by dint of your meritorious deeds and get the\nholy happy ends of your endeavours.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n17\\. Haris\xc2\x92chandra said :-- \xc2\x93O King of the Devas! The Cha _nd_ ala is my\nmaster; so until I get freedom from his bondage, I cannot go to the Heavens\nwithout his permission.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n18\\. Dharma said :-- I am myself that Cha _nd_ ala and had assumed that form\nand shewed you the city of the Cha _nd_ alas. Knowing that you will suffer.\n\n\n\n19\\. What more than this, that I myself am that very Cha _nd_ ala, I am that\nvery Brahmi _n_ and I am that very poisonous serpent who had smitten your boy.\n[Note: This is all the one and the same the Fourth Dimensional Space.] Indra\nsaid :-- Haris\xc2\x92chandra! Now get up, by virtue of your own meritorious deeds to\nthat place which is highly covetted by all the human beings that exist on\nearth.\n\n\n\np. 686\n\n\n\n20-24. Haris\xc2\x92chandra said :-- \xc2\x93O King of the Devas! I bow down to you. Kindly\nconsider what I say now. All the inhabitants of the city Kos\xc2\x92ala are in\nmourning, due to their being separated from me. How then, can I go to the\nHeavens leaving my sorrow-stricken subjects here. To abandon the Bhaktas, the\ndevotees, is to incur the great sin due to the murder of a Brahmi _n_ , the\nkilling of a woman, the drinking of liquors and the killing of a cow. O Indra!\nIt is highly inadvisable to abandon a Bhakta who is always in service. How can\none be happy when one abandons such devotees. So I will not go to the Heavens\nwithout them. You better go back to the Heavens. O Lord of the Devas! If my\nsubjects can go with me, I am ready to go with them to the Heavens or to the\nHell.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n25\\. Indra said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Some of them are more sinful, some are more\nmeritorious; different grades of people exist there. So, O King! How can you\ndesire all to go simultaneously to the Heavens.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n26-29. Haris\xc2\x92chandra said :-- \xc2\x93O Indra! It is through the power of the\ncitizens that the Kings enjoy their kingdoms, perform great many sacrifices,\nand do many engineering works (in excavating tanks, etc.) There is no doubt in\nthis. So I, too, have done religious acts and sacrifices through my citizens\xc2\x92\nhelp. They gave me all the articles necessary for kings. So how can I now quit\nthem so that I may get the Heavens. O Lord of the Devas! If my subjects have\nno such Pu _n_ yams as to enable them to go up to the Heavens, then let the Pu\n_n_ yams done by me in giving away charities, in the performance of\nsacrifices, and other meritorious works be divided amongst them equally. If I\nmyself enjoy S\xc2\x92varga for a very long time; but, if by your favour, I can enjoy\nwith them even one day\xc2\x92s residence in S\xc2\x92varga for my merits, that is also\nsuperior to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n30-33. Suta said :-- \xc2\x93Let that be;\xc2\x94 saying thus Indra, the Lord of the three\nworlds, Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, and Dharma who were very pleased went immediately to\nAyodhya from Ka _s_ \xc2\x92i by their yogic power. In an instant they reached\nAyodhya, filled with the Brahma _n_ as, K _s_ attriyas, Vais\xc2\x92yas, and S\xc2\x92udras;\nand Indra exclaimed to them all :-- \xc2\x93Let all the citizens come before\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra, without any delay. Today they all will go to the Heavens by\nvirtue of the Pu _n_ yams of Haris\xc2\x92chandra.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, they took all the\nmen to Haris\xc2\x92chandra. Then that religious King told his subjects, \xc2\x93Let you all\nnow ascend with me to the Heavens.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n34-40. Suta said :-- Hearing these words of Indra and their King, they all\nbecame very glad. Then those who were engaged in their worldly desires, they\nhanded over the charge of their worldly concerns to their own\n\n\n\np. 687\n\n\n\nsons, gladly became ready to go up to the Heavens. The high-minded King\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra then installed his son Rohitas\xc2\x92va on the royal throne and\npermitted him to go to the beautiful city Ayodhya, filled with jolly and\nhealthy inhabitants. Next addressing his son and friends, he took leave of\nthem. Thus, by virtue of his own good deeds, the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra attained\ngreat celebrity. He then got up and took his seat in the aerial car that has\nno equal and that goes at will. It was beautifully adorned, very rare even to\nthe Devas and decked with bells emitting jingling Kinkini sounds. The high-\nsouled S\xc2\x92ukracharya, versed in the S\xc2\x92astras and the Guru of the Daityas,\nseeing, Haris\xc2\x92chandra in the Vimana, spoke thus :--\n\n\n\n41\\. Oh! What is the glorious result of forbearance (Titik _s_ a)! What is the\ngreat fruit of charity! Oh! Due to whose influence, the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra\ntoday has attained the same region with Mahendra!\n\n\n\n42-43. Suta said :-- Thus I have described to you all the doings of\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra. Any man, oppressed with sorrows and troubles, no doubt, attains\nconstant happiness, if he hears it. What more than this, those who want\nS\xc2\x92varga get S\xc2\x92varga, those who want son get sons, those who want wife get\nwife, and those who want kingdoms get their kingdoms by hearing this incident.\n\n\n\nHere ends the twenty-seventh Chapter of the Seventh Book on the going of\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra to the Heavens, in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam,\nof 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 28](bk07ch28.htm)\n\n"
