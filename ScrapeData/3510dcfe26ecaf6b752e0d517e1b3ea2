Now, therefore, the Upakarman (or the rite preparatory to the study) of\nthe Veda (must be performed) on the full moon day of the month _S_ rava _n_ a\nor Praush _th_ apada. 1\n\n2\\. Having kindled the sacred fire, he offers (therein) unground (rice)\ngrains,\n\n3\\. To the gods, to the _Ri_ shis, and to the Kha _n_ _d_ as.\n\n4\\. Let them begin to study the Vedas, after having made Brahma _n_ as\n(invited for the purpose) wish 'welfare' (svasti), and after having fed them\nwith sour milk,\n\n5\\. (And continue the Veda-study) during four 5\n\np. 64\n\nmonths and a half or during five months and a half.\n\n6\\. After (the expiration of) that (period), he may study (the Vedas) during\nthe bright half of each month, 6\n\n7\\. But the supplementary treatises (A\xe1\xb9\x85gas) of the Veda at pleasure (both\nduring the bright and the dark halves of each month).\n\n8\\. Interruptions of the (Veda-study shall take place),\n\n9\\. If it thunders during the twilight, 9\n\n10\\. During (both) the twilights (of each day), 10\n\n11\\. In towns where a corpse (lies) or _K_ a _n_ _d_ alas (stay). 11\n\n12\\. At pleasure (he may study seated) in (a place) which has been smeared\nwith cowdung and around which a line has been drawn. 12\n\n13\\. (Let him not study) near a burial-ground, 13\n\n14\\. (Nor) lying down, 14\n\n15\\. Nor when he has eaten or received a gift at a funeral sacrifice; 15\n\n16\\. And with reference to this (subject) they quote a verse of Manu, 'Be it\nfruit, or water, or 16\n\np. 65\n\nsesamum, or food, or whatever be the (gift) at a _S_ raddha, let him not,\nhaving just accepted it, recite the Veda; for it is declared in the Sm _ri_\nti, that the hand of a Brahma _n_ a is his mouth.'\n\n17\\. (Let him not recite the Veda) while he runs, (nor) while a foul smell and\nthe like (are perceptible, nor) on barren ground, 17\n\n18\\. (Nor) when he has ascended a tree, 18\n\n19\\. (Nor) in a boat or in a camp, 19\n\n20\\. Nor after meals while his hands are moist, 20\n\n21\\. (Nor) while the sound of a Va _n_ a (is heard), 21\n\n22\\. (Nor) on the fourteenth day (of each half-month, nor) on the new moon\nday, (nor) on the eighth day (of each half-month, nor) on an Ash _t_ aka, 22\n\n23\\. (Nor) while he stretches his feet out, (nor) while he makes a lap, (nor)\nwhile he leans against (something), nor (in any other unbecoming posture), 23\n\n24\\. (Nor) close to his Gurus,\n\n25\\. (Nor) during that night in which he has had conjugal intercourse,\n\n26\\. (Nor) dressed in that garment which he had on during conjugal\nintercourse, except if it has been washed, 26\n\np. 66\n\n27\\. (Nor) at the extremity of a village, 27\n\n28\\. (Nor) after (an attack of) vomiting, 28\n\n29\\. (Nor) while voiding urine or faeces. 29\n\n30\\. (Let him not recite) the Rig-veda, the Ya _g_ ur-veda, and (the Atharva-\nveda) while the sound of the Saman melodies (is audible), nor (the Saman while\nthe other Vedas are being recited). 30\n\n31\\. (Let him not study) before (his food is) digested, 31\n\n32\\. (Nor) when a thunderbolt falls, 32\n\n33\\. (Nor) when an earthquake happens,\n\n34\\. Nor when the sun and the moon are eclipsed.\n\n35\\. When a preternaturally loud sound is heard in the sky, when a mountain\nfalls, (and) when showers of stones, blood or sand (fall from the sky, the\nVeda must not be read) during the twenty-four hours (immediately succeeding\nthe event). 35\n\n36\\. If meteors and lightning appear together, (the interruption shall last)\nthree (days and) nights.\n\n37\\. A meteor (alone and) a flash: of lightning (alone cause an interruption\nlasting) as long as the sun shines (on that or the next day).\n\n38\\. (If rain or other celestial phenomena come) out of season, (the Veda must\nnot be read) during the twenty-four hours (immediately succeeding the event).\n38\n\np. 67\n\n39\\. If the teacher has died, (he shall not study the Veda) during three (days\nand) nights. 39\n\n40\\. If the teacher's son, a pupil, or a wife (have died, he shall not study)\nduring a day and a night. 40\n\n41\\. Let him honour an officiating priest, a father-in-law, paternal and\nmaternal uncles, (though they may be) younger than himself, by rising and\nsaluting them,\n\n42\\. Likewise the wives of those persons whose feet must be embraced, and the\nteacher's (wives) 42\n\n43\\. And his parents.\n\n44\\. Let him say to one acquainted with (the meaning of) a salute, 'I N. N.\nho! (salute thee);' 44\n\n45\\. But him who does not know it (he shall address with the same formula,\nomitting his name). 45\n\n46\\. When a salute is returned, the last vowel (of the noun standing) in the\nvocative is produced to the length of three moras, and if it is a diphthong (e\nor o) changeable according to the Sandhi rules, it becomes ay or av, e.g. bho,\nbhav. 46\n\n47\\. A father who has committed a crime causing loss of caste must be cast\noff. But a mother does not become an outcast for her son. 47\n\n48\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 48\n\np. 68\n\n[paragraph continues] 'The teacher (a _k_ arya) is ten times more venerable\nthan a sub-teacher (upadhyaya), the father a hundred times more than the\nteacher, and the mother a thousand times more than the father.'\n\n49\\. 'A wife, sons, and pupils who are defiled by sinful deeds, must first be\nreproved, and (if they do not amend, then) be cast off. He who forsakes them\nin any other way, becomes (himself) an outcast.' 49\n\n50\\. An officiating priest and a teacher who neglect to teach the recitation\nof the Veda, or to sacrifice, shall be cast off. If he does not forsake them,\nhe becomes an outcast. 50\n\n51\\. They declare that the male offspring of outcasts are (also) outcasts, but\nnot the females. 51\n\n52\\. For a female enters (the family of) a stranger.\n\n53\\. He may marry such a (female) without a dowry. 53\n\n54\\. 'If the teacher's teacher is near, he must be treated like the teacher\n(himself). The Veda declares that one must behave towards the teacher's son\njust as towards the teacher.' 54\n\n55\\. A Brahma _n_ a shall not accept (as gifts) weapons, poison, and\nspirituous liquor.\n\n56\\. Learning, wealth, age, relationship, and occupation must be honoured. 56\n\n57\\. (But) each earlier named (quality) is more venerable than (the succeeding\nones).\n\n58\\. If he meets aged men, infants, sick men, load-carriers, women, and\npersons riding in chariots, he 58\n\np. 69\n\nmust make way (for them, i.e.) for each later (named before those enumerated\nearlier).\n\n59\\. If a king and a Snataka meet, the king must make (way) for the Snataka.\n\n60\\. All (must make way) for a bride who is being conveyed (to her husband's\nhouse).\n\n61\\. Grass, room (for resting), fire, water, a welcome, and kind words never\nfail in the houses of good men. 61\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[63:1](sbe1416.htm#fr_369) **XIII**.

The above\ntranslation follows K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita's gloss. But the Sutra may\nalso be taken differently: 'In (villages) where a corpse lies or a _K_ a _n_\n_d_ ala stays (and) in towns.' For the prohibition to study in towns is\nmentioned by Gautama XVI, 45; Manu IV, 116; and \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 9, 4.\n\n[64:12](sbe1416.htm#fr_375) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 3, 9, 5.

K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\nimproperly divides the Sutra into two.\n\n[66:30](sbe1416.htm#fr_391) Vish _n_ u XXX, 26.\n\n[66:31](sbe1416.htm#fr_392) Vish _n_ u XXX, 21.\n\n[66:32](sbe1416.htm#fr_393)-34.

In returning a salute, the\nname of the person addressed is pronounced, and if it ends in a, the vowel is\nmade pluta, while e and o are changed to aya and ava, e.g. Hare to Haraya.\n\n[67:47](sbe1416.htm#fr_402) Gautama XX, I; XX, 15; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 10, 28, 9.\n\n[67:48](sbe1416.htm#fr_403) Manu II, 145.\n\n[68:49](sbe1416.htm#fr_404) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 8, 29-30.\n\n[68:50](sbe1416.htm#fr_405) Gautama XXI, 12.\n\n[68:51](sbe1416.htm#fr_406) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 10, 29, 14.\n\n[68:53](sbe1416.htm#fr_407) Manu II, 238; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 261.\n\n[68:54](sbe1416.htm#fr_408) Vish _n_ u XXVIII, 29, 31.\n\n[68:56](sbe1416.htm#fr_409) Vish _n_ u XXXII, 16.\n\n[68:58](sbe1416.htm#fr_410)-59.
