Shree [Krishnu](errata.htm#10) Chund, having thus\ninspired the brahmin with confidence, said, "As a burning flame comes forth\nfrom wood by rubbing it, so will I bring away the beauteous Rookmunee, having\ndestroyed the army of wicked demons."\n\nHaving thus spoken, and arrayed himself in an elegant and handsome dress,\ncovered with jewels, Krishnu went to the Raja Oogursen, and said with joined\nhands, "O great king! Bheekmuk, the Raja of Koondulpore, has written me a\nletter, offering his daughter, which he has sent by the hand of his family\npriest, and has invited me to come alone; with your permission I will go, and,\nhaving married his daughter, bring her here." Oogursen said in reply, "Why\nhave you fixed your affections in so distant a country? You are going there\nalone, Moorari; avoid entering into quarrels, or wrangling with any one; who\nwill send us intelligence here of you?" Oogursen afterwards added, "Well, if\nyou must go there, take all your army with you, and go accompanied by your\nbrother, and return quickly after the marriage; do not fight or quarrel with\nany one there; because you will live long and will be able to obtain many very\nbeautiful women." On receiving his permission, Shree Krishnu Chund said to\nOogursen,\n\np. 217\n\n[paragraph continues] "O great king! you have spoken truly, but I will proceed\nin advance; and please send Bulram Jee after me with the army." With these\nwords, Huri took leave of Oogursen and Basoodeo; and, having gone to the\nbrahmin, sent for his ruth, and Daruk, his charioteer. On receiving Krishnu\'s\norder, he immediately harnessed a chariot with four horses, on which Shree\nKrishnu ascended; and, having seated the brahmin by his side, proceeded from\nDwarka to Koondulpore. On emerging from the city, he saw herds of deer running\non his right hand; and lions and lionesses, rushing roaring from opposite him,\nwith their food.\n\nUpon observing this good omen, the brahmin reflected and said, "O great king!\nfrom beholding this omen, I am of opinion, that you will obtain a full\naccomplishment of your wishes, just as these animals have obtained the object\nof their desires." Shree Krishnu Chund replied, "By your favour it will happen\nso." Having then spoken, Huri advanced thence; and beholding new countries,\ncities and villages arrived at Koondulpore; and observed, on his arrival, that\nthe beauty of the city had been very much increased by the marriage\npreparations, which were being everywhere made. The lanes were swept clean,\nand the cross-roads spread over with cloths, and sprinkled with perfumes and\nsandal wood. There were clusters of betelnut and vegetables, in the midst of\nwhich, cocoanuts of gold were distributed. There were innumerable garlands in\neach house, composed of green leaves, fruits and flowers; flags, banners and\nwreaths were waving in the air, and elegant golden spires were attached to the\ntops of domes, and there was rejoicing in each house. O great king! such was\nthe beauty of the scene in the city; but it is impossible to give a\ndescription of the festivities inside the palace, which required to be seen to\nbe properly appreciated. Shree Krishnu Chund having, in the course of his\nprogress, seen all the city, encamped in an enclosed ground, belonging to the\nRaja Bheekmuk, and seated in the refreshing shade, having cooled\n\np. 218\n\nhimself after his journey, said to the Brahmin, "O divinity! go first of all,\nand inform Rookmunee Jee of my arrival, that she may acquire confidence, and\nbanish her sorrows. Afterwards acquaint me with all that has transpired there,\nthat I may arrange my plans accordingly." The brahmin said, "O lord of mercy!\nto-day is the first day of the marriage; and there is great confusion and\nbustle of preparation in the palace, I will go and take an opportunity of\nmentioning your arrival to Rookmunee Jee, when I find her alone." With these\nwords the brahmin went thence. O great king! Huri thus arrived quietly and\nalone; whilst on the other hand, Raja Sissoopal, accompanied by Joorasindhoo\nand armies of demons, arrived with boundless show and splendour, and brought\nsuch a crowd with him, that the king of the serpent race, the snake Sheshu, on\none of the heads of which the world rests, began to totter from the weight,\nand the earth to be upset. Having received information of their arrival, Raja\nBheekmuk advanced with his ministers and relations to receive them: and having\nmet the bridegroom with great honour and dignity, robing all the party in\nrobes of honour, and presenting them with arms studded with jewels, and\nornaments, elephants, and horses, brought them into the city; and having fixed\nupon a place in the bride\'s house for the reception of the\n[bridegroom](errata.htm#11) and his train, entertained them with deferential\nrespect.\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said,--O\nlord of the earth! I will now narrate an intermediate story, to which be\npleased to listen with attention. When Shree Krishnu Chund left Dwarka, all\nthe descendants of Judoo went to Raja Oogursen, and said, "O great king! we\nhave heard, that Raja Sissoopal has got to Koondulpore with Joorasindhoo and\nall his army of evil spirits to the marriage; and Huri has gone alone. From\nthis "we are certain, that there will be fighting between them and Shree\nKrishnu Jee. With this opinion, firmly fixed in our mind, how can we remain\nhere, pretending ignorance, and abandon Huri? Our\n\np. 219\n\nown wishes are averse to this, and we are ready to act according to your\ninstructions."\n\nOn hearing these words, the Raja Oogursen was greatly alarmed and frightened;\nand having sent for Bulram Jee, explained to him and said, "Go quickly with\nall my army to Koondulpore, so as to reach the city before Shree Krishnu\'s\narrival, and bring him back with you." On receiving the Raja\'s order, Buldeo\nJee took with him to Koondulpore fifty-six crores of the descendants of Judoo.\nThe elephants of the army of all colours, black, white and purple, appeared\nlike clouds, and their white tusks appeared like rows of cranes. The large\nkettle-drums sounded like thunder, and their arms shone like lightning. Troops\nof horsemen, dressed in red and yellow, were seen scattered here and there:\nwhole ranges of chariots advanced, glittering with splendour; on beholding the\nbeauty of which, the gods were delighted, and with the greatest . joy rained\ndown flowers from the sky, seated in their cars and expressed wishes for\nKrishnu\'s success and victory. In the mean while, and about the time of Huri\'s\narrival, Bulram Jee arrived also at Koondulpore. After this, Shree Shookdeo\nJee added, O great king! Shree Krishnu Chund, the sea of beauty and light of\nthe world, arrived thus at Koondulpore; but Rookmunee, not having been\ninformed of his coming, was displeased, and gazed in every direction, like the\nmoon, which is dimmed on the approach of morning. Her elegant mind was greatly\noverwhelmed by excess of anxious thought; and she stood gazing and looking in\nevery direction from a lofty balcony. She peeped through the windows and\ndoors, tears streaming from her eyes. Dissatisfied, and greatly depressed in\nmind, she sighed deeply, weeping from agitation, and oppressed with sad\nthoughts she said, "Why has Huri not come yet, whose name is \'the acquainted\nwith the secrets of the heart?\' What fault have I committed, that he has not\nyet thought of me? Has the brahmin not gone to him, or does he think me ugly,\n\np. 220\n\nand not wish to return my affection, or has he been prevented by the arrival\nof Joorasindhoo? To-morrow is the marriage-day, and the demon has come. If he\nshould take my hand to-morrow, how can this sinful soul survive without Huri?\nPrayers, penance, vows and acts of charity have been no protection to me. What\nshall I do? Whither shall I go? Sissoopal has come with his marriage\nprocession; why has the merciful Krishnu delayed coming so long?"\n\nWhen Rookmunee had thus spoken, one of her companions said, "How can Huri come\nto such a distant country, without permission from his father and brother?"\nAnother said, "He, whose titles are \'acquainted with the secrets of the heart\nand merciful to the poor,\' will certainly not fail in coming. Be of good\ncheer, Rookmunee; be not agitated, I have a firm belief, that some one will\ncome presently, and announce Huri\'s arrival." O great king! whilst these two\nwere thus engaged in discourse, the brahmin arrived; and having pronounced a\nblessing said, "Shree Krishnu Chund Jee has arrived, and is encamped in one of\nthe royal enclosures; and Buldeo Jee is following with all the army."\n\nOn seeing the brahmin, and hearing what he had said, Rookmunee Jee\'s spirits\nwere revived; and then she was as happy as a devotee, who leas obtained the\nfruit of his penance. After a short time, Shree Rookmunee Jee, with joined\nhands, and bowing her head, began to say in presence of the brahmin, "By\ncoming to-day, and mentioning the arrival of Huri, you have restored me to\nlife; what return shall I make you for this? If I were to give the wealth of\nthe universe, I should still be in your debt."\n\nHaving thus spoken, she remained fearful, and abashed. The brahmin being\nhighly gratified, and pronouncing a benediction, rose and went thence to the\nRaja Bheekmuk, and explained all the circumstances of Shree Krishnu\'s arrival.\nOn hearing this authentic account, the Raja Bheekmuk rose up and\n\np. 221\n\nproceeded to the enclosure where Shree Krishnu and Bulram, the abodes of\npleasure, were living; prostrating himself on his arrival so as to touch the\nground with the eight principal parts of his body, he appeared before them,\nand with joined hands said, "You are the root of my mind, Huri; how shall I\nexplain to you what our wicked enemies have done? My desires have been\naccomplished by your coming here."\n\nHaving thus spoken, and having had Krishnu comfortably housed, Raja Bheekmuk\nreturned to his own palace, and reflecting began to say, "Every one knows the\nexploits of Huri; who can say, how his arrival here has been brought about?"\nAnd all the inhabitants of the city, male and female, came to where Shree\nKrishnu and Buldeo were, and sung of their renowned actions, and celebrated\ntheir praises, saying to each other, "Rookmunee is a fit bride for Shree\nKrishnu. Bruhmu grant that this match may take place, and last long." In the\nmean while, upon a sudden thought the two brothers went to look at the city;\ncrowds of men and women were collected at every market, road and cross-road,\nto which the two brothers went; who sprinkling perfumes and sandal, and rose-\nwater, and raining down flowers on them stretched out their hands, and pointed\nout the two brothers to each other: "Bulram is dressed in blue, and Krishnu in\nyellow silk, they have crowns on their heads, and tremulous ear-rings; their\nlotus eyes, wish to steal away our hearts." The two brothers went on viewing\nthe city; at length, having seen all the city and the forces of Raja\nSissoopal, they returned to their own army.\n\nOn hearing of their arrival, Raja Bheekmuk\'s eldest son was exceedingly wroth,\nand going to his father began to say, Say, truly, at whose invitation has\nShree Krishnu come here? I cannot understand how he can have come, without\nbeing invited. A marriage is an occasion and affair of pleasure, what business\nhas he here? Wherever these two\n\np. 222\n\ndeceitful, perverse creatures go, they occasion injury. If you value your own\nwelfare, tell me, truly, by whom were they invited?"\n\nO great king! Rookum having thus endeavoured to terrify his father, rose and\nwent thence, uneasy and disturbed in mind, to the court of Sissoopal and\nJoorasindhoo, and said to them, "Bulram and Krishnu have come here; inform all\nyour people of this, that they may be on their guard."\n\nOn hearing the names of the two brothers, Raja Sissoopal looking back upon the\nexploits and history of Huri became low-spirited, and began to be very\nthoughtful, and Joorasindhoo said, "Wherever these two come they commit some\nviolence or other, they are very powerful, and treacherous. In Bruj they have\nslain with ease Kuns and other mighty demons; do not look upon them as\nchildren, they have never been defeated in any encounter. Shree Krishnu\ndestroyed my army seventeen times; when I attacked the eighteenth time, he ran\naway, and climbed up a mountain, which I set on fire, and he, by some trick,\nescaped to Dwarka. No one understands Krishnu\'s nature, he has come hereto\ncommit violence. He is very deceitful, and will practise great deceit, and no\none will be able to understand him. Arrange, therefore, your plans, so that\nour characters maybe preserved." When Joorasindhoo had thus spoken Rookum\nreplied, "What things are they, that you are so apprehensive about them? I\nknow them well; they wander about the jungles, singing and dancing, and\nplaying the flute, and tending herds. What do those village children know of\nthe science of war? Banish all anxiety from your mind, I will in a second\nrepel and slay Shree Krishnu and Bulram, and all the descendants of Judoo."\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said, O great king! Rookum returned home that day after\nhaving entered into explanations with Joorasindhoo and Sissoopal, and inspired\nthem with confidence, and they spent the night in uneasiness.\n\np. 223\n\nIn the morning Rajas Sissoopal and Joorasindhoo, considering it the marriage-\nday, were engaged in all the bustle and preparation of bringing forth the\nmarriage procession: and there were festive rejoicings also at the palace of\nthe Raja Bheekmuk. In the mean while Rookmunee Jee sent a message to Shree\nKrishnu Chund by a brahmin, saying, "O abode of kindness! this is the\nmarriage-day; when two ghurees of the day are left, I will go to perform\npoojah at a temple of Dewee, eastward of the city. My modesty and good name\nhave been entrusted to you; act, so that they may be preserved."\n\nAfterwards, when the day was somewhat advanced, her female friends and\ncompanions, and relatives arrived; on coming there, having first filled up a\nsquare place in the courtyard with large pearls, and arranging upon it a\ngolden chair, studded with ornaments, they seated Rookmunee upon it, and had\nher rubbed with oil by the hands of seven married women. Afterwards, having\napplied perfumes and scented paste, and bathed and washed her, they decked her\nout completely with jewels and ornaments; and arraying her in a red boddice,\nthey placed her in her full bridal dress on the chair. When about four ghurees\nof the day remained, the youthful Rookmunee, accompanied by her female friends\nand companions, went forth in musical procession to perform poojah to Dewee;\nand Raja Bheekmuk sent some of his people to protect her. On hearing that the\nRaja\'s daughter had gone outside the city to worship Dewee, Raja Sissoopal,\nthrough dread of Shree Krishnu Chund, summoned some of his mighty heroes, and\npowerful warlike attendants; and, having given them most minute instructions,\nsent them to guard Rookmunee Jee. They came, bringing with them their arms and\nweapons of all kinds, and accompanied the Raja\'s daughter. At that time\nRookmunee, accompanied by crowds of her female companions, proceeding veiled\nunder the guard and protection of black demons, appeared as beautiful as the\nmoon surrounded by stars, in the\n\np. 224\n\nmidst of a black cloud. At length, after proceeding some distance, she reached\nthe temple of Dewee. Having gone to the temple, she washed her feet and hands,\nand sipping water from the palm of her hand, became purified. The Raja\'s\ndaughter having made an offering of sandal, rice, flowers, perfumes, lamps and\nconsecrated food, went through the ceremony of worshipping Dewee with great\nfaith, and according to the injunctions of the Vedas. Having afterwards\nprepared food agreeable to female brahmins, she arrayed them in elegant\ndresses, and making sectarial marks on their foreheads, and fastening thereon\nthe unbroken rice used in the oblation, made them presents, and received their\nblessing. Having afterwards offered adoration to Dewee by going round to the\nright, that lovely creature, with a face like the moon, of the colour of the\nflower chumpa, with deer-like eyes, a voice like the kokila, and the gait of\nan elephant, taking her companions with her, was occupied with the thought of\nmeeting Huri. And as she was on the point of returning, after having finished\nall the necessary rites and ceremonies, Shree Krishnu Chund, seated on his\nruth, arrived alone at the spot where the warlike attendants of Rookmunee were\nstanding fully armed.\n\nHaving recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--When she was returning,\nafter having worshipped Dewee one of her companions said, in a state of\nagitation, "O beautiful Rookmunee! Huri has arrived: behold his waving\nbanner." Having heard this speech of her companions, and beholding the flag\nattached to Krishnu\'s ruth, the Raja\'s daughter was so overjoyed, that her\nbody could not contain her. Placing her hand in that of her companion, she\nadvanced amongst them all in the hope of meeting Huri, with such a fascinating\nlook, smiling, and at such an easy, composed pace, that all description is\nimpossible of the beauty of her appearance. The guards on seeing Shree Krishnu\nChund all seemed to be deprived of sense, and stood still; and the screen of\ncloth, behind which\n\np. 225\n\n[paragraph continues] Rookmunee was concealed, dropped from their hands. And\non beholding the beautiful and fascinating face of Rookmunee, they were more\ndistracted, and were so upset, that they lost all thought and recollection.\nShe raised her eye-brow, in the form of a bow, and having shot forth the\narrows of her eyes from the bowstring of her darkened eye-lashes, in the act\nof killing them, restored them to life.\n\nO great king! at that time all the demons stood gazing like painted pictures;\nand Shree Krishnu Chund, having advanced his chariot amongst them, stopped\nnear Rookmunee, who, on beholding her soul\'s lord, was suffused with blushes;\nand, as she stretched out her hand to meet Krishnu, he raised her up with his\nleft hand, and seated her on his ruth; she trembled and was greatly abashed;\nand, having abandoned all others, went off with Huri. Like a religious ascetic\nwho abandons his home, and fixes his affections on the feet of Krishnu.\n\nO great king! Rookmunee Jee obtained the fruit of all the prayers, penance,\nfasts and acts of charity she had performed, and forgot all her former\nsorrows. Her enemies seized their arms, and stood gazing at her. Krishnu\ncarried off Rookmunee from the midst of them, just as a lion would spring\namongst large troops of jackals, and seizing its prey, go off fearless and\nroaring. After Shree Krishnu Chund\'s departure, Bulram Jee, sounding the\nkettle-drum, joined him with all his army.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LV](psa56.htm)\n\n'
