But it is designated thus (i.e. as atomic), on account of its having for\nits essence the qualities of that (i.e. the buddhi); as in the case of the\nintelligent Self (i.e. Brahman).\n\nThe word 'but' is meant to set aside the opinion maintained hitherto.--The\nsoul is not of atomic size, since scripture does not declare it to have had an\norigin. On the contrary, as scripture speaks of the highest Brahman entering\ninto the elements and teaches that it is their Self, the soul is nothing else\nbut the highest Brahman. And if the soul is the highest Brahman, it must be of\nthe same extent as Brahman. Now scripture states Brahman to be all-pervading.\nTherefore the soul also is all-pervading.--On that view all the statements\nabout the all-pervadingness of the soul made in _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti are\njustified, so, for instance, the passage, 'He is that great unborn Self who\nconsists of knowledge, is surrounded by the pra _n_ as &c.' (B _ri_. Up. IV,\n4, 22). Nor again could the soul, if it were of atomic size, experience\nsensations extending over the whole body. If it be said that that is possible\nowing to the soul's connexion\n\np. 43\n\nwith the sense of touch (the skin), we deny that assertion. For from that it\nwould follow that, when we tread on a thorn, the sensation extends over the\nwhole body, since the connexion of the thorn and the skin abides in the entire\nskin, and the skin extends over the whole body. While as a matter of fact,\nwhen treading on a thorn we experience a sensation in the sole of the foot\nonly.--Nor again is it possible that a quality of an atom should diffuse\nitself beyond the atom. For qualities occupy the same place with the\nsubstances of which they are qualities, and a quality not abiding in its\nsubstance would no longer be a quality. Concerning the light emitted from a\nlamp we have already shown that it is, not a quality, but rather a different\nkind of substance. Hence odour also, being avowedly a quality, can exist in so\nfar only as it inheres in its substance; otherwise it would cease to be odour.\nThus the reverend Dvaipayana also says, 'Having perceived odour in water some\nunthinking people ascribe it to the latter; but know that it is in the earth\nonly, and (merely) passes over into air and water.' If the intelligence of the\nsoul pervades the whole body, the soul cannot be atomic; for intelligence\nconstitutes the soul's proper nature, just as heat and light constitute that\nof fire. A separation of the two as quality and that which is qualified does\nnot exist. Now it has already been shown (II, 2, 34) that the soul is not of\nthe same size as the body; the only remaining alternative therefore is that it\nis all-pervading (infinite). But why then, our opponent asks, is the soul\ndesignated (in some scriptural passages) as being of atomic size, &c.?--It is\ndesignated as such 'on account of being of the nature of the essence of that\n(i.e. the buddhi).'--The Self is here said to be of the nature of the essence\nof the mind's (buddhi) qualities, because those qualities, such as desire,\naversion, pleasure, pain and so on, constitute the essence, i.e. the principal\ncharacteristics of the Self as long as it is implicated in transmigratory\nexistence. Apart from the qualities of the mind the mere Self does not exist\nin the sa _m_ sara state; for the latter, owing to which the Self appears as\nan agent and enjoyer, is altogether due to the circumstance of\n\np. 44\n\nthe qualities of the buddhi and the other limiting adjuncts being wrongly\nsuperimposed upon the Self. That the non-transmigrating eternally free Self\nwhich neither acts nor enjoys is declared to be of the same size as the\nbuddhi, is thus due only to its having the qualities of the buddhi for its\nessence (viz. as long as it is in fictitious connexion with the buddhi).\nMoreover we have the scriptural passage, 'That living soul is to be known as\npart of the hundredth part of the point of a hair, divided a hundred times,\nand yet it is to be infinite' ( _S_ ve. Up. V, 9), which at first states the\nsoul to be atomic and then teaches it to be infinite. Now this is appropriate\nonly in the case of the atomicity of the soul being metaphorical while its\ninfinity is real; for both statements cannot be taken in their primary sense\nat the same time. And the infinity certainly cannot be understood in a\nmetaphorical sense, since all the Upanishads aim at showing that Brahman\nconstitutes the Self of the soul.--The other passage also ( _S_ ve. Up. V, 8)\nwhich treats of the measure of the soul, 'The lower one, endowed with the\nquality of mind and the quality of body, is seen small even like the point of\na goad,' teaches the soul's small size to depend on its connexion with the\nqualities of the buddhi, not upon its own Self. The following passage again,\n'That small (a _n_ u) Self is to be known by thought' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 9),\ndoes not teach that the soul is of atomic size, since the subject of the\nchapter is Brahman in so far as not to be fathomed by the eye, &c., but to be\napprehended by the serene light of knowledge, and since moreover the soul\ncannot be of atomic size in the primary sense of the word. Hence the statement\nabout a _n_ utva (smallness, subtlety) has to be understood as referring\neither to the difficulty of knowing the soul, or else to its limiting\nadjuncts. Similarly such passages as 'Having by knowledge taken possession of\nthe whole body' (Kau. Up. III, 6), which mention a difference (between the\nsoul and knowledge), must be understood to mean that the soul takes possession\nof the whole body through the buddhi, its limiting adjunct; or else they must\nbe considered as mere modes of expression, as when we speak of the body of a\nstone statue. For we have\n\np. 45\n\nalready shown that the distinction of quality and thing qualified does not\nexist in the case of the soul.--The statements as to the soul abiding in the\nheart are likewise to be explained on the ground of the buddhi abiding there.\n--That also the soul's passing out and so on depend on the limiting adjuncts,\nis shown by the passage, 'What is it by whose passing out I shall pass out,\nand by whose staying I shall stay? He sent forth pra _n_ a.' &c. (Pr. Up VI,\n3, 4). For where there is no passing out, no going and returning are known;\nfor what has not left the body cannot go and return 1.--As thus the soul (as\nlong as involved in (the sa _m_ sara) has for its essence the qualities of its\nlimiting adjuncts it is spoken of as minute. The case is analogous to that of\nBrahman (pra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a). Just as in those chapters whose topic is the\nmeditation on the qualified Brahman, the highest Self is spoken of as\npossessing relative minuteness and so on, because it has the qualities of its\nlimiting adjuncts for its essence (cp. 'Smaller than a grain of rice or\nbarley;' 'He who consists of mind, whose body is pra _n_ a,' &c., _Kh_. Up.\nIII, 14, 2; 3); so it is also with the individual soul.--Very well, let us\nthen assume that the transmigratory condition of the soul is due to the\nqualities of the buddhi forming its essence. From this however, it will follow\nthat, as the conjunction of buddhi and soul--which are different entities--\nmust necessarily come to an end, the soul when disjoined from the buddhi will\nbe altogether undefinable and thence non-existing or rather non-existing in\nthe sa _m_ sara state 2.--To this objection the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[45:1](sbe38030.htm#fr_28) So that the distinction insisted on in Sutra 20 is\nnot valid\n\n[45:2](sbe38030.htm#fr_29) Katham asativa _m_ svarupena sattvad ity asa\xe1\xb9\x85khyaha\nsa _m_ saritva _m_ veti. \xc3\x82n.
