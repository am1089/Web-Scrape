Vyasa said :-- The extremely covetous Indra, then, mounted on his\nAiravata elephant and determined to kill the Muni. He went to him and saw him\nimmersed in deep Samadhi, firmly seated in his posture and with his speech\ncontrolled. At that time, a halo of light emanated from\n\n\n\np. 485\n\n\n\nhis body and he looked like a second Sun and a blazing fire. Indra became very\nsad and dejected when he saw that. Indra then thought within himself thus :--\n\xc2\x93Oh! Can I slay this Muni, free from any vicious inclinations, and endowed\nwith the power of Tapas, blazing like a fire! This is quite against the\nDharma. But, Alas! He wants to usurp my position; how can I, then, neglect\nsuch an enemy?\xc2\x94 Thus cogitating, Indra hurled at the Muni his swift going,\ninfallible thunderbolt, the Muni remaining engaged in his penance and shining\nlike the Sun and Moon. The ascetic, struck thus, fell on the ground and died,\nlike a mountain peak struck by thunder falling on the ground and presenting a\nwondrous sight. Indra became very glad when he killed the Muni; but the other\nMunis then cried aloud :-- \xc2\x93Oh! We are killed! Alas! What a crime has Indra\ncommitted today! Oh! The vicious Indra has killed today this jewel amongst the\nMunis without any offence! Let, then, this sinner reap the fruits of his\nsinful act without any delay.\xc2\x94 Indra, then, went back soon to his own abode;\non the other hand, the high-souled Muni, though killed, looked as it were,\nliving by the lustre of his own body. Indra, then, seeing him lying like a\nliving man thought that the Muni might get alive and so became very sad. While\nhe was thus arguing in his mind, he saw before him a wood cutter named Tak _s_\na and began to speak to him for his own selfish ends thus \xc2\x93O Artisan! Cut all\nthe heads of this Muni and keep my word; this highly lustrous Muni is looking\nas it were alive; therefore, if you sever his heads, he cannot be alive.\xc2\x94 Tak\n_s_ a then cursed him and spoke thus.\n\n\n\n12-14. \xc2\x93O King of the Devas! The neck of this Muni is very big and therefore\ncannot be severed; my axe is not at all fit for this work . Specially I cannot\ndo such a blameable act. You have done a very heinous crime, quite against the\nlaw of the good persons; I fear sin; I will not be able to cut the heads of a\ndead man. This Muni is lying dead; what use is there in severing his head\nagain? O Pakas'asana! The killer of the demon Paka! Why do you fear in this?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n15\\. Indra said :-- \xc2\x93O Artisan! This Muni is my dire enemy. Life seems to be\nstill lingering in his body; his body is still lustrous, I fear if the Muni be\nalive again!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n16\\. Tak _s_ a told :-- \xc2\x93Do you not feel shame in doing this heinous crime,\nwhen you know everything? Do you not fear God for the crime of killing a\nBrahmi _n_?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n17\\. Indra said :-- I will make Prayas'chitta (penance) afterwards for the\nwashing away of my sins; but my duty at present is to kill my enemy.\n\n\n\np. 486\n\n\n\nO Fortunate One! The wise men, clever in polity, say that enemies must be\nkilled by any excuse whatsoever.\n\n\n\n18\\. Tak _s_ a then replied :-- \xc2\x93O Maghavan! You are doing this sinful deed\nout of your avarice; but, O Lord! I have no cause whatsoever; how then without\nany cause, can I engage myself in such a vicious act?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n19-20. Indra said :-- \xc2\x93O Tak _s_ an! I will allot a share to you wherever\nthere will be a sacrifice. The human beings will invariably offer to you the\nhead of the animal killed at any sacrifice. Now cut his head according to this\nrule.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n21-42. Vyasa said :-- O King! That Tak _s_ a became very glad when he heard\nthus from Indra and struck off the heads of the Muni with his very strong axe.\nO powerful King! When the three heads, thus severed, fell to the ground,\nthousands and thousands of birds came out of those heads in quick succession.\nThe three groups of birds Kalavinkas, Tittiris and Kapinjalas came out very\nrapidly from the three heads in due succession. The Kapinjala birds came out\nof that mouth that used to chant the Vedas and used to drink Soma; the Tittiri\nbirds came out of that mouth that used to see all the quarters as if it drank\nthem; and the Kalavinka birds came out of that face that used to drink wine.\nIndra became very glad to see the birds thus coming out of his mouths and went\nback at once to his Heavens. O King! No sooner Indra went back, than Tak _s_ a\ncame back to his own house and felt himself very pleased to receive his share\nof sacrificial things. On returning to his home, Indra thought that he had\ndone his duty in slaying his powerful enemy. It did not pass in his mind that\nhe had committed the Brahmahattya sin (i. e., that he had killed a Brahmi _n_\n). When Vis'vakarma heard that his virtuous son had been killed, he became\nvery angry (in his mind) and said that as Indra had killed his qualified son\nengaged in asceticism without any offence, he would create another son to kill\nIndra. Let the Devas see his strength and power of Tapasya and let Indra, too,\nreap the far-reaching effects of his own Karma. Thus saying, Vis'vakarma\ndistressed with anger, offered oblations in the sacrificial Fire, reciting\nMantram from the Atharvan Vedas, with the object of producing a son. When Homa\nwas performed for eight nights consecutively, a man quickly came out of that\nburning fire, as if he was the Incarnate of Fire itself. Seeing the lustrous\nson before him, come out of the fire and endowed with power and energy,\nVis'vakarma said \xc2\x93O Indra's enemy! Grow by my power of asceticism.\xc2\x94 When\nVis'vakarma spoke these words, burning with anger, that brilliant fiery son\nbegan to grow, towering high above the Heavens. Within a moment that man\nlooked a second God of Death and appeared like a\n\n\n\np. 487\n\n\n\nmountain and shone like the God Himself. Then he spoke to his own father\nVis'vakarma, who was very distressed \xc2\x93O Father! Put my name. Pray, what use\ncan I be to you? Why do you look so aggrieved and anxious; please explain to\nme all the causes. I make a firm vow today that will remove the cause of your\nsorrow. Father ! Of what avail is that to his father when he is not able to\nremove his sorrows!\xc2\x94 O Father! Shall I drink the ocean or crumble the\nmountains to dust or shall I obstruct the passage of the rising Sun or shall I\nkill Indra, Yama, or the other host of Devas or shall I root out the earth and\nthrow it with all beings into the ocean?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n43-53. O King! Hearing thus the sweet words of his son, Vis'vakarma gladly\ntold his mountain-like son \xc2\x93O my Son! You are capable to save me from troubles\n(Vrijina) hence you are named V _r_ itra. O highly Fortunate One! Your\nbrother, named Tris'ira, was a great ascetic; his three faces were all very\nstrong. He was thoroughly conversant with the Vedas and the Vedangas and well\nversed in all the other knowledges. He remained always engaged in practising\nasceticism, surprising to the three worlds. Indra killed my qualified son with\nhis thunderbolt; that wicked soul severed the three heads without any offence.\nTherefore, O Best of beings! Kill that vicious, shameless, deceitful, wicked\nIndra guilty of the sin of Brahmahattya.\xc2\x94 O King! Thus saying, Vis'vakarma\nvery much confounded with the breavement of his son, created various divine\nweapons. He prepared weapons specially suited to kill Indra, the best axes,\ntridents, clubs, S'aktis, Tomaras and bows made of horns and arrows, Parighas,\nPattis'as, divine discus like the Sudars'an Chakra, divine inexhaustible arrow\ncases with arrows, nice Kavacha, very substantial air-like swift-going chariot\nlooking like a cloud and capable to carry great loads; all these he created\nand gave over to his son. O King! Vis'vakarma, the best of architects, excited\nby anger, made ready all the equipments necessary for war and gave them to his\nson V _r_ itrasura and sent him to kill Indra.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Second Chapter of the Sixth Book on the birth of V _r_ itrasura\nin the Maha Puranam S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 3](bk06ch03.htm)\n\n"
