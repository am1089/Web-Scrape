If it be said (that a contradiction will result) in respect of the word;\nwe refute this objection on the ground that (the world) originates from the\nword, as is shown by perception and inference.\n\nLet it then be granted that, from the admission of the corporeal individuality\nof the gods, no contradiction will result in the case of sacrificial works.\nStill a contradiction will result in respect of the 'word' ( _s_ abda).--How?\n--The authoritativeness of the Veda has been proved 'from its independence,'\nbasing on the original (eternal) connection of the word with its sense ('the\nthing signified') 1. But now, although a divinity possessing corporeal\nindividuality, such as admitted above, may, by means of its supernatural\npowers, be able to enjoy at the same time the oblations\n\np. 202\n\nwhich form part of several sacrifices yet it will, on account of its very\nindividuality, be subject to birth and death just as we men are, and hence,\nthe eternal connexion of the eternal word with a non-eternal thing being\ndestroyed, a contradiction will arise with regard to the authoritativeness\nproved to belong to the word of the Veda.\n\nTo this we reply that no such contradiction exists.--Why?--'On account of\ntheir origin from it.' For from that very same word of the Veda the world,\nwith the gods and other beings, originates.--But--an objection will be raised\n--in Sutra I, 1, 2 ('That whence there is the origin, &c. of this world') it\nhas been proved that the world originates from Brahman; how then can it be\nsaid here that it originates from the word? And, moreover, even if the origin\nof the world from the word of the Veda be admitted, how is the contradiction\nin regard to the word removed thereby, inasmuch as the Vasus, the Rudras, the\n\xc3\x82dityas, the Vi _s_ vedevas, and the Maruts 1 are non-eternal beings, because\nproduced; and if they are non-eternal, what is there to preclude the non-\neternality of the Vedic words Vasu, &c. designating them? For it is known from\nevery-day life that only when the son of Devadatta is born, the name Ya _g\n\xc3\xb1_adatta is given to him (lit. made for him) 2. Hence we adhere to our opinion\nthat a contradiction does arise with regard to the 'word.'\n\nThis objection we negative, on the ground that we observe the eternity of the\nconnexion between such words as cow, and so on, and the things denoted by\nthem. For, although the individuals of the (species denoted by the word) cow\nhave an origin, their species 3 does not have an origin, since of (the three\ncategories) substances, qualities, and actions the individuals only originate,\nnot the species. Now it is with the species that the words are connected, not\nwith the individuals, which, as being infinite in number, are not capable of\nentering into that connexion. Hence, although\n\np. 203\n\nthe individuals do not originate, no contradiction arises in the case of words\nsuch as cow, and the like, since the species are eternal. Similarly, although\nindividual gods are admitted to originate, there arises no contradiction in\nthe case of such words as Vasu, and the like, since the species denoted by\nthem are eternal. And that the gods, and so on, belong to different species,\nis to be concluded from the descriptions of their various personal appearance,\nsuch as given in the mantras, arthavadas, &c. Terms such as 'Indra' rest on\nthe connexion (of some particular being) with some particular place,\nanalogously to terms such as 'army-leader;' hence, whoever occupies that\nparticular place is called by that particular name.--The origination of the\nworld from the 'word' is not to be understood in that sense, that the word\nconstitutes the material cause of the world, as Brahman does; but while there\nexist the everlasting words, whose essence is the power of denotation in\nconnexion with their eternal sense (i. e. the ak _r_ itis denoted), the\naccomplishment of such individual things as are capable of having those words\napplied to them is called an origination from those words.\n\nHow then is it known that the world originates from the word?--'From\nperception and inference.' Perception here denotes Scripture which, in order\nto be authoritative, is independent (of anything else). 'Inference' denotes Sm\n_r_ iti which, in order to be authoritative, depends on something else (viz.\nScripture). These two declare that creation is preceded by the word Thus a\nscriptural passage says, 'At the word these Pra _g_ apati created the gods; at\nthe words were poured out he created men; at the word drops he created the\nfathers; at the words through the filter he created the Soma cups; at the\nwords the swift ones he created the stotra; at the words to all he created the\n_s_ astra; at the word blessings he created the other beings.' And another\npassage says, 'He with his mind united himself with speech (i. e. the word of\nthe Veda.--B _ri_. Up. I, 2, 4). Thus Scripture declares in different places\nthat the word precedes the creation.--Sm _r_ ti also delivers itself as\nfollows, 'In the beginning\n\np. 204\n\na divine voice, eternal, without beginning or end, formed of the Vedas was\nuttered by Svayambhu, from which all activities proceeded. 'By the 'uttering'\nof the voice we have here to understand the starting of the oral tradition (of\nthe Veda), because of a voice without beginning or end 'uttering' in any other\nsense cannot be predicated.--Again, we read, 'In the beginning Mahe _s_ vara\nshaped from the words of the Veda the names and forms of all beings and the\nprocedure of all actions.' And again, 'The several names, actions, and\nconditions of all things he shaped in the beginning from the words of the\nVeda' (Manu I, 21). Moreover, we all know from observation that any one when\nsetting about some thing which he wishes to accomplish first remembers the\nword denoting the thing, and after that sets to work. We therefore conclude\nthat before the creation the Vedic words became manifest in the mind of Pra\n_g_ apati the creator, and that after that he created the things corresponding\nto those words. Scripture also, where it says (Taitt. Bra. II, 2, 4, 2)\n'uttering bhur he created the earth,' &c., shows that the worlds such as the\nearth, &c. became manifest, i.e. were created from the words bhur, &c. which\nhad become manifest in the mind (of Pra _g_ apati).\n\nOf what nature then is the 'word' with a view to which it is said that the\nworld originates from the 'word?'--It is the spho _t_ a, the purvapakshin\nsays.  1 For on the assumption\n\np. 205\n\nthat the letters are the word, the doctrine that the individual gods, and so\non, originates from the eternal words of the Veda could not in any way be\nproved, since the letters perish as soon as they are produced (i. e.\npronounced). These perishable letters are moreover apprehended as differing\naccording to the pronunciation of the individual speaker. For this reason we\nare able to determine, merely from the sound of the voice of some unseen\nperson whom we hear reading, who is reading, whether Devadatta or Ya _g\n\xc3\xb1_adatta or some other man. And it cannot be maintained that this apprehension\nof difference regarding the letters is an erroneous one; for we do not\napprehend anything else whereby it is refuted. Nor is it reasonable to\nmaintain that the apprehension of the sense of a word results from the\nletters. For it can neither be maintained that each letter by itself intimates\nthe sense, since that would be too wide an assumption;  1 nor that there takes\nplace a simultaneous apprehension of the whole aggregate of letters; since the\nletters succeed one another in time. Nor can we admit the explanation that the\nlast letter of the word together with the impressions produced by the\nperception of the preceding letters is that which makes us apprehend the\nsense. For the word makes us apprehend the sense only if it is itself\napprehended in so far as having reference to the mental grasp of the constant\nconnexion (of the word and the sense), just as smoke makes us infer the\nexistence of fire only when it is itself apprehended; but an apprehension of\nthe last letter combined with the impressions produced by the preceding\nletters does not actually take place, because those impressions are not\nobjects of perception.  2 Nor, again, can it be maintained that (although\nthose impressions\n\np. 206\n\nare not objects of perception, yet they may be inferred from their effects,\nand that thus) the actual perception of the last letter combined with the\nimpressions left by the preceding letters--which impressions are apprehended\nfrom their effects--is that which intimates the sense of the word; for that\neffect of the impressions, viz. the remembrance of the entire word, is itself\nsomething consisting of parts which succeed each other in time.--From all this\nit follows that the spho _t_ e is the word. After the apprehending agent, i.\ne. the buddhi, has, through the apprehension of the several letters of the\nword, received rudimentary impressions, and after those impressions have been\nmatured through the apprehension of the last letter, the spho _t_ a presents\nitself in the buddhi all at once as the object of one mental act of\napprehension.--And it must not be maintained that that one act of apprehension\nis merely an act of remembrance having for its object the letters of the word;\nfor the letters which are more than one cannot form the object of one act of\napprehension.--As that spho _t_ a is recognised as the same as often as the\nword is pronounced, it is eternal; while the apprehension of difference\nreferred to above has for its object the letters merely. From this eternal\nword, which is of the nature of the spho _t_ a and possesses denotative power,\nthere is produced the object denoted, i. e. this world which consists of\nactions, agents, and results of action.\n\nAgainst this doctrine the reverend Upavarsha maintains that the letters only\nare the word.--But--an objection is raised--it has been said above that the\nletters no sooner produced pass away!--That assertion is not true, we reply;\nfor they are recognised as the same letters (each time they are produced\nanew).--Nor can it be maintained that the recognition is due to similarity\nonly, as in the case of hairs, for instance; for the fact of the recognition\nbeing a recognition in the strict sense of the word is not contradicted by any\nother means of proof.--Nor, again, can it be said\n\np. 207\n\nthat the recognition has its cause in the species (so that not the same\nindividual letter would be recognised, but only a letter belonging to the same\nspecies as other letters heard before); for, as a matter of fact, the same\nindividual letters are recognised. That the recognition of the letters rests\non the species could be maintained only if whenever the letters are pronounced\ndifferent individual letters were apprehended, just as several cows are\napprehended as different individuals belonging to the same species. But this\nis actually not the case; for the (same) individual letters are recognised as\noften as they are pronounced. If, for instance, the word cow is pronounced\ntwice, we think not that two different words have been pronounced, but that\nthe same individual word has been repeated.--But, our opponent reminds us, it\nhas been shown above, that the letters are apprehended as different owing to\ndifferences of pronunciation, as appears from the fact that we apprehend a\ndifference when merely hearing the sound of Devadatta or Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1adatta\nreading.--Although, we reply, it is a settled matter that the letters are\nrecognised as the same, yet we admit that there are differences in the\napprehension of the letters; but as the letters are articulated by means of\nthe conjunction and disjunction (of the breath with the palate, the teeth,\n&c.), those differences are rightly ascribed to the various character of the\narticulating agents and not to the intrinsic nature of the letters themselves.\nThose, moreover, who maintain that the individual letters are different have,\nin order to account for the fact of recognition, to assume species of letters,\nand further to admit that the apprehension of difference is conditioned by\nexternal factors. Is it then not much simpler to assume, as we do, that the\napprehension of difference is conditioned by external factors while the\nrecognition is due to the intrinsic nature of the letters? And this very fact\nof recognition is that mental process which prevents us from looking on the\napprehension of difference as having the letters for its object (so that the\nopponent was wrong in denying the existence of such a process). For how\nshould, for instance, the one syllable ga, when it is pronounced in\n\np. 208\n\nthe same moment by several persons, be at the same time of different nature,\nviz. accented with the udatta, the anudatta, and the Svarita and nasal as well\nas non-nasal 1? Or else 2\\--and this is the preferable explanation--we assume\nthat the difference of apprehension is caused not by the letters but by the\ntone (dhvani). By this tone we have to understand that which enters the ear of\na person who is listening from a distance and not able to distinguish the\nseparate letters, and which, for a person standing near, affects the letters\nwith its own distinctions, such as high or low pitch and so on. It is on this\ntone that all the distinctions of udatta, anudatta, and so on depend, and not\non the intrinsic nature of the letters; for they are recognised as the same\nwhenever they are pronounced. On this theory only we gain a basis for the\ndistinctive apprehension of the udatta, the anudatta, and the like. For on the\ntheory first propounded (but now rejected), we should have to assume that the\ndistinctions of udatta and so on are due to the processes of conjunction and\ndisjunction described above, since the letters themselves, which are ever\nrecognised as the same, are not different. But as those processes of\nconjunction and disjunction are not matter of perception, we cannot definitely\nascertain in the letters any differences based on those processes, and hence\nthe apprehension of the udatta and so on remains without a basis.--Nor should\nit be urged that from the difference of the udatta and so on there results\nalso a difference of the letters recognised. For a difference in one matter\ndoes not involve a difference in some other matter which in itself is free\nfrom difference. Nobody, for instance, thinks that because the individuals\n\np. 209\n\nare different from each other the species also contains a difference in\nitself.\n\nThe assumption of the spho _t_ a is further gratuitous, because the sense of\nthe word may be apprehended from the letters.--But--our opponent here objects\n--I do not assume the existence of the spho _t_ a. I, on the contrary,\nactually perceive it; for after the buddhi has been impressed by the\nsuccessive apprehension of the letters of the word, the spho _t_ a all at once\npresents itself as the object of cognition.--You are mistaken, we reply. The\nobject of the cognitional act of which you speak is simply the letters of the\nword. That one comprehensive cognition which follows upon the apprehension of\nthe successive letters of the word has for its object the entire aggregate of\nthe letters constituting the word, and not anything else. We conclude this\nfrom the circumstance that in that final comprehensive cognition there are\nincluded those letters only of which a definite given word consists, and not\nany other letters. If that cognitional act had for its object the spho _t_ a--\ni. e. something different from the letters of the given word--then those\nletters would be excluded from it just as much as the letters of any other\nword. But as this is not the case, it follows that that final comprehensive\nact of cognition is nothing but an act of remembrance which has the letters of\nthe word for its object.--Our opponent has asserted above that the letters of\na word being several cannot form the object of one mental act. But there he is\nwrong again. The ideas which we have of a row, for instance, or a wood or an\narmy, or of the numbers ten, hundred, thousand, and so on, show that also such\nthings as comprise several unities can become the objects of one and the same\ncognitional act. The idea which has for its object the word as one whole is a\nderived one, in so far as it depends on the determination of one sense in many\nletters 1; in the same way as the idea of a\n\np. 210\n\nwood, an army, and so on. But--our opponent may here object--if the word were\nnothing else but the letters which in their aggregate become the object of one\nmental act, such couples of words as _g_ ara and ra _g_ a or pika and kapi\nwould not be cognised as different words; for here the same letters are\npresented to consciousness in each of the words constituting one couple.--\nThere is indeed, we reply, in both cases a comprehensive consciousness of the\nsame totality of letters; but just as ants constitute the idea of a row only\nif they march one after the other, so the letters also constitute the idea of\na certain word only if they follow each other in a certain order. Hence it is\nnot contrary to reason that the same letters are cognised as different words,\nin consequence of the different order in which they are arranged.\n\nThe hypothesis of him who maintains that the letters are the word may\ntherefore be finally formulated as follows. The letters of which a word\nconsists--assisted by a certain order and number--have, through traditional\nuse, entered into a connexion with a definite sense. At the time when they are\nemployed they present themselves as such (i. e. in their definite order and\nnumber) to the buddhi, which, after having apprehended the several letters in\nsuccession, finally comprehends the entire aggregate, and they thus unerringly\nintimate to the buddhi their definite sense. This hypothesis is certainly\nsimpler than the complicated hypothesis of the grammarians who teach that the\nspho _t_ a is the word. For they have to disregard what is given by\nperception, and to assume something which is never perceived; the letters\napprehended in a definite order are said to manifest the spho _t_ a, and the\nspho _t_ a in its turn is said to manifest the sense.\n\nOr let it even be admitted that the letters are different ones each time they\nare pronounced; yet, as in that case we necessarily must assume species of\nletters as the basis of the recognition of the individual letters, the\nfunction of conveying the sense which we have demonstrated in the case of the\n(individual) letters has then to be attributed to the species.\n\np. 211\n\nFrom all this it follows that the theory according to which the individual\ngods and so on originate from the eternal words is unobjectionable.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[201:1](sbe34097.htm#fr_198) The reference is to Purva Mima _m_ sa Sutras I,\n1, 5 (not to I, 2, 21, as stated in Muir's Sanskrit Texts, III, p. 69).\n\n[202:1](sbe34097.htm#fr_199) In which classes of beings all the gods are\ncomprised.\n\n[202:2](sbe34097.htm#fr_200) Which shows that together with the non-eternality\nof the thing denoted there goes the non-eternality of the denoting word.\n\n[202:3](sbe34097.htm#fr_201) \xc3\x82k _ri_ ti, best translated by \xce\xb5\xe1\xbc\xb6\xce\xb4\xce\xbf\xcf\x82.\n\n[204:1](sbe34097.htm#fr_202) The purvapakshin, i. e. here the grammarian\nmaintains, for the reasons specified further on, that there exists in the case\nof words a supersensuous entity called spho _t_ a which is manifested by the\nletters of the word, and, if apprehended by the mind, itself manifests the\nsense of the word. The term spho _t_ a may, according as it is viewed in\neither of these lights, be explained as the manifestor or that which is\nmanifested.--The spho _t_ a is a grammatical fiction, the word in so far as it\nis apprehended by us as a whole. That we cannot identify it with the 'notion'\n(as Deussen seems inclined to do, p. 80) follows from its being distinctly\ncalled va _k_ aka or abhidhayaka, and its being represented as that which\ncauses the conception of the sense of a word (arthadhihetu).\n\n[205:1](sbe34097.htm#fr_203) For that each letter by itself expresses the\nsense is not observed; and if it did so, the other letters of the word would\nhave to be declared useless.\n\n[205:2](sbe34097.htm#fr_204) In order to enable us to apprehend the sense from\nthe word, there is required the actual consciousness of the last letter plus\nthe impressions of the preceding letters; just as smoke enables us to p. 206\ninfer the existence of fire only if we are actually conscious of the smoke.\nBut that actual consciousness does not take place because the impressions are\nnot objects of perceptive consciousness.\n\n[208:1](sbe34097.htm#fr_205) 'How should it be so?' i.e. it cannot be so; and\non that account the differences apprehended do not belong to the letters\nthemselves, but to the external conditions mentioned above.\n\n[208:2](sbe34097.htm#fr_206) With 'or else' begins the exposition of the\nfinally accepted theory as to the cause why the same letters are apprehended\nas different. Hitherto the cause had been found in the variety of the upadhis\nof the letters. Now a new distinction is made between articulated letters and\nnon-articulated tone.\n\n[209:1](sbe34097.htm#fr_207) I. e. it is not directly one idea, for it has for\nits object more than one letter; but it may be called one in a secondary sense\nbecause it is based on the determinative knowledge that the letters, although\nmore than one, express one sense only.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 29](sbe34098.htm)\n\n"
