Produced by attrition, well preserved in his abode, the young sage, the\nleader of worship, Agni ever young in the forests\n[1](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:1:1) that grow old-- _G_ atavedas, has here assumed\nimmortality [2](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:1:2).\n\n2\\. The two Bharatas [1](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:2:1), Deva _s_ ravas and\nDevavata, in the midst of wealth have produced by attrition Agni the skilful\n(god). Agni, look forth with mighty wealth, and then be\n[2](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:2:2) for us a guide of food day by day.\n\n3 [1](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:3:1). The ten fingers have brought him to the\nbirth, the ancient, beloved (Agni), well born in his mothers\n[2](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:3:2). Praise, O Deva _s_ ravas, the Agni of Devavata\nwho [3](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:3:3) should be the lord of people.\n\n4\\. I have laid [1](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:1) thee\n[2](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:2) down in the best (place) of the earth\n[3](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:3), in the place of I _l_ a\n[3](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:3), in the auspiciousness of days. O Agni, as the\ngod who has belonged to Manus [4](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:4), shine with wealth\non the D _ri_ shadvati, on the \xc3\x82paya, on the Sarasvati.\n\n5 = III, 1, 23.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shis are Deva _s_ ravas Bharata and Devavata Bharata (see verse 2);\nthe metre is Trish _t_ ubh (verse 5 Satob _ri_ hati).--No verse occurs in the\nother Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The 'forests' are the fuel. 'Does the poet mean: Never consumed in the\nconsumed wood or forests,\n\np. 288\n\ni. e. the fire burns and is kept alive while the wood is burnt up?' M. M.\n\nNote 2. Or, 'he has received the drink of immortality'--which may refer to the\nghee offered in the fire.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. On the tribe of the Bharatas having their seats, as verse 4 seems to\nshow, on the borders of the Sarasvati and of the D _ri_ shadvati, see H. O.,\nBuddha (first edition), 413 seq.\n\nNote 2. This is an imperative in -tat, signifying, as Delbruck has shown\n(Syntaktische Forschungen, III, 2 seq.; Altindische Syntax, 363), an\ninjunction to be carried out after something else has been done or has\nhappened. Agni is first to look about (vi pa _s_ ya), and shall then become\n(bhavatat) a guide of food, i. e. he shall lead plenty of food to the\nworshipper's house.--Prof. Max Muller translates isha\xc2\xb4m neta\xc2\xb4, 'a guide to\nfood.'\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Should this Satob _ri_ hati, standing alone among Trish _t_ ubh\nverses, be considered as forming a distich together with verse 2? Comp. H. O.,\nDie Hymnen des Rigveda, vol. i, p. 102, note 7.\n\nNote 2. The woods.\n\nNote 3. Agni, not Devavata, is referred to.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Or, 'he has laid.' The form may be first or third person, present or\nperfect.\n\nNote 2. Agni is addressed.\n\nNote 3. The best place of the earth, the place of I _l_ a (i. e. of the\nnourishment coming from the cow, of the ghee offered into Agni) is the\nsacrificial ground or more especially the spot on which the sacrificial fire\nis established.\n\nNote 4. Or 'to men.' The Padapa _th_ a has ma\xc2\xb4nushe, but ma\xc2\xb4nusha _h_ seems\nmore probable.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 24](sbe46084.htm)\n\n"
