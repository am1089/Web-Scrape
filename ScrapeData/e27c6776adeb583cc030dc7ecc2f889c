XII.\n\nDescendants of Krosht\xcc\x81ri. Jyamagha\'s connubial affection for his wife \xc5\x9aaivya:\ntheir descendants kings of Vidarbha and Chedi.\n\nKROSHT\xcc\x81RI, the son of Yadu 1, had a son named Vrijinivat 2; his son was Swahi\n3; his son was Rushadru 4; his son was Chitraratha; his son was \xc5\x9aa\xc5\x9bavindu, who\nwas lord of the fourteen great gems 5; he had a hundred thousand wives and a\nmillion of sons 6. The most renowned of them were Prithuya\xc5\x9bas, Prithukarman,\nPrithujaya, Prithukirtti, Prithudana, and Prithu\xc5\x9bravas. The son of the last of\nthese six 7 was Tamas 8; his son was U\xc5\x9banas 9, who celebrated a hundred\nsacrifices of the horse; his son was \xc5\x9aiteyus 10; his son was Rukmakavacha 11;\nhis son was Paravrit, who lead five sons, Rukmeshu, Prithurukman, Jyamagha,\nPalita, and Harita 12. To this day the following verse relating to Jyamagha\n\np. 421\n\nis repeated: "Of all the husbands submissive to their wives, who have been or\nwho will be, the most eminent is the king Jyamagha 13, who was the husband of\n\xc5\x9aaivya." \xc5\x9aaivya was barren; but Jyamagha was so much afraid of her, that he\ndid not take any other wife. On one occasion the king, after a desperate\nconflict with elephants and horse, defeated a powerful foe, who abandoning\nwife, children, kin, army, treasure, and dominion, fled. When the enemy was\nput to flight, Jyamagha beheld a lovely princess left alone, and exclaiming,\n"Save me, father! Save me, brother!" as her large eyes rolled wildly with\naffright. The king was struck by her beauty, and penetrated with affection for\nher, and said to himself, "This is fortunate; I have no children, and am the\nhusband of a sterile bride; this maiden has fallen into my hands to rear up to\nme posterity: I will espouse her; but first I will take her in my car, and\nconvey her to my palace, where I must request the concurrence of the queen in\nthese nuptials." Accordingly he took the princess into his chariot, and\nreturned to his own capital.\n\nWhen Jyamagha\'s approach was announced, \xc5\x9aaivya came to the palace gate,\nattended by the ministers, the courtiers, and the citizens, to welcome the\nvictorious monarch: but when she beheld the maiden standing on the left hand\nof the king, her lips swelled and slightly quivered with resentment, and she\nsaid to Jyamagha, "Who is this light-hearted damsel that is with you in the\nchariot?" The king unprepared with a reply,\n\np. 422\n\nmade answer precipitately, through fear of his queen; "This is my daughter-in-\nlaw." "I have never had a son," rejoined \xc5\x9aaivya, "and you have no other\nchildren. Of what son of yours then is this girl the wife?" The king\ndisconcerted by the jealousy and anger which the words of \xc5\x9aaivya displayed,\nmade this reply to her in order to prevent further contention; "She is the\nyoung bride of the future son whom thou shalt bring forth." Hearing this,\n\xc5\x9aaivya smiled gently, and said, "So be it;" and the king entered into his\ngreat palace.\n\nIn consequence of this conversation regarding the birth of a son having taken\nplace in an auspicious conjunction, aspect, and season, the queen, although\npassed the time of women, became shortly afterwards pregnant, and bore a son.\nHis father named him Vidarbha, and married him to the damsel he had brought\nhome. They had three sons, Kratha, Kai\xc5\x9bika 14, and Romapada 15. The son of\nRomapada was Babhru 16, and his son was Dhriti 17. The son of Kai\xc5\x9bika was\nChedi, whose descendants were called the Chaidya kings 18. The son of Kratha\nwas Kunti 19; his son was Vrishn\xcc\x81i 20; his son was Nirvriti 21; his son was\nDasarha; his son was Vyoman; his son was Jimuta; his son was Vikriti 22; his\nson was Bhimaratha; his son was Navaratha 23; his son was Da\xc5\x9baratha 24; his\nson was \xc5\x9aakuni; his son was Karambhi; his son was Devarata; his son was\nDevakshatra 25; his son was Madhu 26; his son was Anavaratha; his\n\np. 423\n\nson was Kuruvatsa; his son was Anuratha; his son was Puruhotra; his son was\nAn\xc5\x9bu; his son was Satwata, from whom the princes of this house were termed\nSatwatas. This was the progeny of Jyamagha; by listening to the account of\nwhom, a man is purified from his sins.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[420:1](vp105.htm#fr_1119) In the Brahma P. and Hari V. we have two families\nfrom Krosht\xcc\x81ri; one which is much the same as that of the text; the other\nmakes short work of a long story, as we shall again notice.\n\n[420:2](vp105.htm#fr_1120) Vajravat: Kurma.\n\n[420:3](vp105.htm#fr_1121) \xc5\x9aanti: Kurma. Swaha: Matsya. Tri\xc5\x9banku Linga.\n\n[420:4](vp105.htm#fr_1122) Vishansu: Agni. Rishabha: Linga. Ku\xc5\x9bika: Kurma.\nRu\xc5\x9beku: Bhagavata.\n\n[420:5](vp105.htm#fr_1123) Or articles the best of their kind; seven animate,\nand seven inanimate; a wife, a priest, a general, a charioteer, a horse, an\nelephant, and a body of foot soldiers; or, instead of the last three, an\nexecutioner, an encomiast, a reader of the Vedas; and a chariot, an umbrella,\na jewel, a sword, a shield, a banner, and a treasure.\n\n[420:6](vp105.htm#fr_1124) The text states this in plain prose, but the Vayu\nquotes a verse which makes out but a hundred hundred or 10,000 sons.\n\n[420:7](vp105.htm#fr_1125) The Matsya has the first, third, and fifth of our\ntext, and Prithudharma, Prithukirtti, and Prithumat. The Kurma has also six\nnames, but makes as many successions.\n\n[420:8](vp105.htm#fr_1126) Suyajna: Agni, Brahma, Matsya. Dharma: Bhagavata.\n\n[420:9](vp105.htm#fr_1127) Ushat: Brahma, Hari V.\n\n[420:10](vp105.htm#fr_1128) \xc5\x9aitikshu: Agni. \xc5\x9aineyus: Brahma. Purujit:\nBhagavata. The Vayu has Maruta and Kambalavarhish, brothers, instead.\n\n[420:11](vp105.htm#fr_1129) Considerable variety prevails here. The Brahma and\nHari V. have Marutta the Rajarshi (a gross blunder, see [p.\n352](vp093.htm#page_352)), Kambalavarhish, \xc5\x9aataprasuti, Rukmakavacha: the Agni\n--Marutta, Kambalavarhish, Rukmeshu: whilst the Bhagavata makes Ruchaka son of\nU\xc5\x9banas, and father to the five princes who in the text are the grandsons of\nRukmakavacha.\n\n[420:12](vp105.htm#fr_1130) The Bhagavata has Rukmeshu, Rukman, Jyamagha,\nPrithu, and Purujit. The p. 421 Vayu reads the two last names Parigha and\nHari. The Brahma and Hari V. insert Parajit as the father of the five named as\nin the text.\n\n[421:13](vp105.htm#fr_1131) Most of the other authorities mention that the\nelder of the five brothers, Rukmeshu, succeeded his father in the sovereignty;\nand that the second, Prithurukman, remained in his brother\'s service. Palita\nand Harita were set over Videha (Linga) or Tirhut, and Jyamagha went forth to\nsettle where he might: according to the Vayu he conquered Madhyade\xc5\x9ba (the\ncountry along the Narmada), Mekala, and the \xc5\x9auktimat mountains. So the Brahma\nP. states that he established himself along the Rikshavat mountain, and dwelt\nin \xc5\x9auktimati. He names his son, as we shall see, Vidarbha: the country so\ncalled is Berar, and amongst his descendants we have the Chaidyas or princes\nof Boghelkand, and Chandail, and Dasarha, more correctly perhaps Dasarn\xcc\x81a,\nChattisgher; so that this story of Jyamagha\'s adventures appears to allude to\nthe first settlement of the Yadava tribes along the Narmada, more to the south\nand west than before.\n\n[422:14](vp105.htm#fr_1132) The Bhagavata has Ku\xc5\x9ba; the Matsya, Kau\xc5\x9bika: all\nthe authorities agree in specifying three sons.\n\n[422:15](vp105.htm#fr_1133) Lomapada: Agni.\n\n[422:16](vp105.htm#fr_1134) Vastu: Vayu. Kriti: Agni.\n\n[422:17](vp105.htm#fr_1135) \xc3\x81huti: Vayu. Iti: Padma. Dyuti: Matsya. Bhriti:\nKurma. This latter is singular in carrying on the line of Romapada for twelve\ngenerations farther.\n\n[422:18](vp105.htm#fr_1136) The Bhagavata, however, makes the princes of Chedi\ncontinuous from Romapada; as, Babhru, Dhriti, U\xc5\x9bika, Chedi--the Chaidyas,\namongst whom were Damaghosha and \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala.\n\n[422:19](vp105.htm#fr_1137) Kumbhi: Padma.\n\n[422:20](vp105.htm#fr_1138) Dhrisht\xcc\x81a: Vayu. Dhrisht\xcc\x81i: Matsya,\n\n[422:21](vp105.htm#fr_1139) Nivritti: Vayu. Nidhriti: Agni. The Brahma makes\nthree sons, Avanta, Da\xc5\x9barha, and Balivrishahan. In the Linga it is said of\nDasarha that he was \'destroyer of the host of copper (faced; European?) foes.\'\n\n[422:22](vp105.htm#fr_1140) Vikala: Matsya.\n\n[422:23](vp105.htm#fr_1141) Nararatha: Brahma, Hari V.\n\n[422:24](vp105.htm#fr_1142) Drid\xcc\x81haratha: Agni. Devarata: Linga.\n\n[422:25](vp105.htm#fr_1143) Soma: Linga. Devanakshatra: Padma.\n\n[422:26](vp105.htm#fr_1144) There is great variety in the succeeding\nappellations: p. 423\n\nBhagavata.\n\n|\n\nVayu.\n\n|\n\nBrahma.\n\n|\n\nMatsya.\n\n|\n\nPadma.\n\n|\n\nKurma.  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \nMadhu\n\n|\n\nMadhu\n\n|\n\nMadhu\n\n|\n\nMadhu\n\n|\n\nMadhu\n\n|\n\nMadhu  \n  \nKuruva\xc5\x9ba\n\n|\n\nManu\n\n|\n\nManava\xc5\x9bas\n\n|\n\nUruvas\n\n|\n\nPuru\n\n|\n\nKuru  \n  \nAnu\n\n|\n\nPuruvatsa\n\n|\n\nPurudwat\n\n|\n\nPurudwat\n\n|\n\nPunarvasu\n\n|\n\nAnu  \n  \nPuruhotra  \n\xc3\x81yu\n\n|\n\nPurudwat  \nSatwa\n\n|\n\nMadhu  \nand Satwa\n\n|\n\nJantu\n\n|\n\nJantu\n\n|\n\nAnsa  \n  \nSatwata\n\n|\n\nSatwata\n\n|\n\nSatwata\n\n|\n\nSatwata\n\n|\n\nSatwata\n\n|\n\nAndhaka  \nSatwata  \n  \n[paragraph continues] The Linga has Purushaprabhu, Manwat, Pratarddana,\nSatwata; and the Agni, Dravavasu, Puruhuta, Jantu, and Satwata. Some of these\noriginate, no doubt, in the blunders of copyists, but they cannot all be\nreferred to that source.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIII](vp106.htm)\n\n'
