Bright and numerous as the stars were the\ngems that glittered on the robes of the mighty warriors. For a time they spake\nkindly greetings one to another, and jested and made merry. Krishna sat\npondering in silence, and at length he arose and spake, saying:\n\n"O rajahs and princes, may your fame endure for ever! Thou knowest well that\nYudhishthira was deprived of his kingdom by the evil trickster Shakuni. He\nhath endured twelve years of exile, and hath served, like his brethren, as a\nhumble menial for a further year in the palace of the Rajah of Virata. After\nlong suffering Yudhishthira desires peace; his heart is without anger,\n\np. 271\n\nalthough he hath endured great shame. The heart of Duryodhana, however, still\nburns with hate and jealous wrath; still, as in his youth, he desires to work\nevil by deceit against the Pandava brethren. Now, consider well, O ye\nmonarchs, what Yudhishthira should do. Should he call many chieftains to his\naid and wage war to punish his ancient foes? Or should he send friendly\nmessengers to Duryodhana, asking him to restore the kingdom which he still\ncontinues to possess?"\n\nBalarama then spoke and said: "Ye pious rajahs! ye have heard the words of my\nbrother, who loveth Yudhishthira. It is true, indeed, that the Kauravas have\nwronged the Pandavas. Yet I would counsel peace, so that this matter may be\narranged between kinsmen. Yudhishthira hath brought his sufferings upon his\nown head. He was unwise to play with cunning Shakuni, and also to continue\nplaying, despite the warnings of the elders and his friends. He hath suffered\nfor his folly. Now let a messenger be sent to Duryodhana, entreating him to\nrestore the throne unto Yudhishthira. I do not advise war. What hath been\ngambled away cannot be restored in battle."\n\nNext arose Satyaki, the kinsman of Krishna. He said: "O Balarama, thou hast\nspoken like to a woman. Thou remindest me that weaklings are sometimes born to\nwarriors, like to barren saplings sprung from sturdy trees. Timid words come\nfrom timid hearts. Proud monarchs heed not counsel so weakly as thine. O\nBalarama! canst thou justify Duryodhana and blame the pious-hearted and\ngracious Yudhishthira? If it had chanced that Yudhishthira while playing with\nhis brethren had been visited by Duryodhana, who, having thrown the dice,\nachieved success, then the contest would have been fair in the eyes of all\nmen. But Duryodhana plotted to ruin his kinsman,\n\np. 272\n\nand invited him to Hastinapur to play with the evil-hearted Shakuni, who threw\nloaded dice. But that is ended. Yudhishthira hath fulfilled his obligation;\nhis exile is past, and he is entitled to his kingdom. Why, therefore, should\nhe beg for that which is his own? A Kshatriya begs of no man; what is refused\nhim he seizeth in battle at all times. . . . Duryodhana still clings to\nYudhishthira\'s kingdom, despite the wise counsel of Bhishma and Drona.\nRemember, O Balarama, it is not sinful to slay one\'s enemies, but it is\nshameful to beg from them. I now declare my advice to be that we should give\nthe Kauravas an opportunity to restore the throne of Yudhishthira; if they\nhesitate to de so, then let the Pandavas secure justice on the battlefield."\n\nDrupada, Rajah of Panchala, then arose and said: "Ye monarchs, I fear that\nSatyaki hath spoken truly. The Kauravas are a stubborn people. Methinks it is\nuseless to entreat Duryodhana, whose heart is consumed with greed. It is vain\nto plead with Dhritarashtra, who is but as clay in the hands of his proud son.\nBhishma and Drona have already counselled in vain. Karna thirsts for war, and\nDuryodhana intrigues with him and also with false and cunning Shakuni.\nMethinks it were idle to follow the advice of Balarama. Duryodhana will never\nyield up what he now possesseth, nor doth he desire peace. If we should send\nto him an ambassador who will speak mild words, he will think that we are\nweak, and become more boastful and arrogant than heretofore. My advice is that\nwe should gather together a great army without delay: the rajahs will side\nwith him who asketh first. Meanwhile let us offer peace and friendship unto\nDuryodhana: my family priest will carry our message. If Duryodhana is willing\nto give up the kingdom of\n\np. 273\n\n[paragraph continues] Yudhishthira, there will be peace; if he scorns our\nfriendship, he will find us ready for war."\n\nKrishna again addressed the assembly and said: "Drupada hath spoken wisely.\nThe Pandavas would do well to accept his counsel. If Duryodhana will agree to\nrestore the raj unto Yudhishthira, there will be no strife or bloodshed. . . .\nYou all know that the Pandavas and Kauravas are my kinsmen; know also that\nthey are equally dear unto me. . . . I will now go hence. When ye send out\nmessengers of war, let them enter my kingdom last of all."\n\nAfter Krishna had returned home, he was visited by Duryodhana and Arjuna, for\nboth parties desired greatly his help in the war. He spake to the rival\nkinsmen and said: "Behold, I stand before you as in the balance; I have put\nmyself on one side, and all my army is on the other. Choose now between you\nwhether you desire me or my forces. I shall not fight, but will give advice in\nbattle."\n\nThen Duryodhana asked for the army, but Arjuna preferred to have Krishna\nalone. And Krishna promised to be Arjuna\'s charioteer.\n\nDuryodhana sought to prevail upon Balarama to aid him, but Krishna\'s brother\nsaid: "I have no heart for this war. I spake to Krishna in thy favour, but he\nanswered me not. Well, thou knowest that thou hast wronged Yudhishthira, and\nthat it would well become thee to act justly in this matter. Do thy duty, and\nthy renown will be great."\n\nDuryodhana departed in sullen anger from Balarama.\n\nIn time Drupada\'s priest appeared in the city of Hastinapur, and the elders\nand princes sat with Dhritarashtra to hear his message. Said the Brahman:\n"Thus speaketh the Pandavas--\'Pandu and Dhritarashtra were\n\np. 274\n\nbrothers: why, therefore, should Dhritarashtra\'s sons possess the whole\nkingdom, while the sons of Pandu are denied inheritance? Duryodhana hath ever\nworked evil against his kinsman. He invited them to a gambling match to play\nwith loaded dice, and they lost their possessions and had to go into exile\nlike beggars. Now they have fulfilled the conditions, and are prepared to\nforget the past if their raj is restored to them. If their rightful claim is\nrejected, then Arjuna will scatter the Kauravas in battle.\'"\n\nBhishma said: "What thou hast said is well justified, but it is wrong to boast\nregarding Arjuna. It would be wise of thee not to speak of him in such manner\nagain."\n\nAngrily rose Karna and said: "If the Pandavas have suffered, they are\nthemselves to blame. It is but fitting that they should plead for peace, for\nthey are without followers. If they can prove their right to possessions,\nDuryodhana will yield; but he will not be forced by vain threatenings, or\nbecause the Rajahs of Panchala and Virata support them. O Brahman! tell thou\nthe Pandavas that they have failed to fulfil their obligations, for Arjuna was\nbeheld by us before the thirteenth year of banishment was completed. Let them\nreturn to a jungle for another term, and then come hither and submit to\nDuryodhana and beg for his favours."\n\nSaid Bhishma: "Thou didst not boast in this manner, O Karna, when Arjuna\nopposed thee at the Virata cattle raid. Remember that Arjuna is still\npowerful. If war comes, he will trample thee in the dust."\n\nDhritarashtra reproved Karna for his hasty speech, and said unto Bhishma: "He\nis young and unaccustomed to debate; be not angry with him."\n\nThen the blind old monarch sent his minister and charioteer, Sanjaya, to the\nPandavas to speak thus: "If\n\np. 275\n\nyou desire to have peace, come before me and I will do justice. Except wicked\nDuryodhana and hasty Karna all who are here are well disposed to you."\n\nWhen Sanjaya reached the Pandavas, he was astonished to behold that they had\nassembled together a mighty army. He greeted the brethren and delivered his\nmessage.\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "We honour Dhritarashtra, but fear that he has listened to\nthe counsel of his son Duryodhana, who desires to have us in his power. The\nmaharajah offers us protection, but not the fulfilment of our claims."\n\nKrishna then spake, saying: "The Pandavas have assembled a mighty army, and\ncannot reward these soldiers unless they receive their raj. It is not yet too\nlate to make peace. Deliver unto the Kauravas, O Sanjaya, this message: \'If\nyou seek peace, you will have peace; if you desire war, then let there be\nwar.\'"\n\nEre Sanjaya left, Yudhishthira spoke to him and said: "Tell thou Duryodhana\nthat we will accept that portion of the raj which we ourselves have conquered\nand settled: he can retain the rest. My desire is for peace."\n\nMany days went past, and the Pandavas waited in vain for an answer to their\nmessage. Then Yudhishthira spake to Krishna, saying: "We have offered to make\npeace by accepting but a portion of our kingdom, yet the Kauravas remain\nsilent."\n\nSaid Krishna: "I will now journey unto Hastinapur and address the maharajah\nand his counsellors on thy behalf."\n\nYudhishthira said: "Mayst thou secure peace between kinsmen."\n\nThen Draupadi entered and, addressing Krishna, said:\n\np. 276\n\n[paragraph continues] "Yudhishthira is too generous towards the Kauravas in\noffering to give up part of his kingdom unto them. He entreateth them\novermuch, as well, to grant him that which belongs not unto them. If the\nKauravas wage war, my sire and many other rajahs will assist the Pandavas. . .\n. Oh! can it be forgotten how Duhsasana dragged me by the hair to the Gambling\nPavilion, and how I was put to shame before the elders and the princes?" . . .\n\nShe wept bitterly, and Krishna pitied her. "Why do you sorrow thus?" he asked\nwith gentle voice. "The time is drawing nigh when all the Kauravas will be\nlaid low, and their wives will shed tears more bitter than thine that fall\nnow, O fair one."\n\nMessengers who arrived at Hastinapur announced the coming of Krishna. Wise\nVidura counselled that he should be welcomed in state, whereupon Duryodhana\nproclaimed a public holiday, and all the people rejoiced, and decorated the\nstreets with streamers and flowers.\n\nVidura was well pleased, and he said to Duryodhana: "Thou hast done well. But\nthese preparations are in vain if thou art unwilling to do justice unto the\nPandavas."\n\nDuryodhana was wroth, and said: "I will give naught except what they can win\nin battle. If the success of the Pandavas depends upon Krishna, then let us\nseize Krishna and put him in prison."\n\nDhritarashtra was horror-stricken, and cried out: "Thou canst not thus treat\nan ambassador, and especially an ambassador like unto Krishna."\n\nBhishma rose up and said: "O maharajah, thy son desireth to work evil and\nbring ruin and shame upon us all. Methinks disaster is not now afar off."\n\np. 277\n\nSo saying, he departed unto his own house, and Vidura did likewise.\n\nAll the Kauravas went forth to meet the royal ambassador save Duryodhana, who\nscarcely looked upon Krishna when he arrived at the palace.\n\nKrishna went to the house of Vidura, and there he saw Pritha, who wept and\nsaid: "How fares it with my sons, whom I have not beheld for fourteen years?\nHow fares it with Draupadi? In sorrow have I heard of their sufferings in\ndesolate places. Ah! who can understand mine own misery, for every day is full\nof weariness and grief unto me?"\n\nSaid Krishna: "Be comforted, O widow of Pandu! Thy sons have many allies, and\nere long they will return in triumph to their own land."\n\nThereafter Krishna went to the house of Duryodhana, who sat haughtily in the\nfeasting chamber. At length Dhritarashtra\'s son spake unto his kinsman, who\nate naught. He said: "Why art thou unfriendly towards me?"\n\nSaid Krishna: "I cannot be thy friend until thou dost act justly towards thy\nkinsmen, the Pandavas."\n\nWhen Krishna went again to the house of Vidura, the aged counsellor said to\nhim: "\'Twere better if thou hadst not come hither. Duryodhana will take no\nman\'s advice. When he speaketh he doth expect all men to agree with him."\n\nSaid Krishna: "It is my desire to prevent bloodshed. I came to Hastinapur to\nsave the Kauravas from destruction, and I will warn them in the council\nchamber on the morrow. If they will heed me, all will be well; if they scorn\nmy advice, then let their blood be upon their own heads."\n\nWhen the princes and the elders sat with Dhritarashtra\n\np. 278\n\nin the council chamber, Narada and other great Rishis appeared in the heavens\nand were invited to come down and share in the deliberations, and they came\ndown.\n\nKrishna arose, and in a voice like thunder spake forth, saying: "I have come\nhither not to seek war, but to utter words of peace and love. O maharajah, let\nnot your heart be stained with sin. Thy sons have wronged their kinsmen, and a\ndanger threatens all: it approacheth now like an angry comet, and I can behold\nkinsmen slaying kinsmen, and many noble lords laid in the dust. All of you\nhere gathered together are already in the clutch of death. O Dhritarashtra,\nman of peace, stretch forth thine hand and avert the dread calamity which is\nabout to fall upon thy house. Grant unto the Pandavas their rightful claim,\nand thy reign will close in glory unsurpassed and in blessed peace. . . . What\nif all the Pandavas were slain in battle! Would their fall bring thee joy? Are\nthey not thine own brother\'s children? . . . But, know thou, the Pandavas are\nas ready for war as they are eager for peace; and if war comes, it will be\npolluted with the blood of these thy sons. O gracious maharajah, let the last\nyears of thy life be peaceful and pleasant, so that thou mayst be blessed\nindeed."\n\nDhritarashtra wept and said: "Fain would I do as thou hast counselled so\nwisely, O Krishna, but Duryodhana, my vicious son, will not listen to me or\nobey, nor will he give heed unto his mother, nor to Vidura, nor unto Bhishma."\n\nNext Bhishma spoke, and he addressed Duryodhana, saying: "\'Twould be well with\nthee if thou wouldst follow the advice of Krishna. Thou art evil-hearted and a\nwrongdoer; thou art the curse of our family; thou takest pleasure in\ndisobeying thy royal sire and in scorning\n\np. 279\n\nto be guided by Krishna and Vidura. Soon thy sire will be bereft of his\nkingdom because of thy deeds; thy pride will bring death to thy kinsmen. Hear\nand follow my advice; do not bring eternal sorrow to thine aged parents."\n\nDuryodhana heard these words in anger, but was silent.\n\nThen Drona spake to him and said: "I join with Bhishma and Krishna in making\nappeal unto thee. Those who advise thee to make peace are thy friends; those\nwho counsel war are thine enemies. Be not too certain of victory; tempt not\nthe hand of vengeance; leave the night-black road of evil and seek out the\nroad of light and welldoing, O Duryodhana."\n\nNext Vidura rose up. He spoke with slow, gentle voice, and said: "Thou hast\nheard words of wisdom, O Duryodhana. . . . I sorrow deeply in this hour. My\ngrief is not for thee, but for thine aged sire and thine aged mother, who will\nfall into the hands of thine enemies; my grief is for kinsmen and friends who\nmust die in battle, and for those who will thereafter be driven forth as\nbeggars, friendless and without a home. The few survivors of war will curse\nthe day of thy birth, O Duryodhana."\n\nAgain Bhishma spoke. He praised the valour of the Pandavas, and said: "It is\nnot yet too late to avoid calamity. The field of battle is still unstained by\nthe blood of thousands; thine army hath not yet met the arrows of death, O\nDuryodhana. Ere it is too late, make thy peace with thy kinsmen, the Pandavas,\nso that all men may rejoice. Banish evil from thine heart for ever; rule the\nwhole world with the heirs of Pandu."\n\nDhritarashtra still wept. . . . The Rishis counselled peace like the elders.\n\np. 280\n\nThen angry Duryodhana spoke, while his eyes burned bright and his brows hung\ndarkly, and said: "Krishna counsels me to be just, yet he hateth me and loveth\nthe Pandavas. Bishma scowls upon me, and Vidura and Drona look coldly on; my\nsire weeps for my sins. Yet what have I done that ye, O elders, should turn my\nsire\'s affection from me? If Yudhishthira loved gambling and staked and lost\nhis throne and freedom, am I to blame? If he played a second time after being\nset at liberty, and became an exile, why should he now call me a robber?\nPallid and inconstant is the star of the Pandavas\' destiny: their friends are\nfew, and feeble is their army. Shall we, who fear not Indra even, he\nthreatened and browbeaten by the weak sons of Pandu? No warrior lives who can\novercome us. A Kshatriya fears no foeman; he may fall in battle, but he will\nnever yield. So have the sages spoken. . . . Hear me, my kinsmen all! My sire\ngifted Indra-prastha to the Pandavas in a moment of weakness. Never, so long\nas I and my brother live, will they possess it again. Never again will the\nkingdom of Maharajah Dhritarashtra be severed in twain. It has been united,\nand so will remain for ever. My words are firm and plain. So tell thou the\nPandavas, O Krishna, that they ask in vain for territory. Nor town nor village\nwill they again possess with my consent. I swear by the gods that I will never\nhumble myself before the Pandavas."\n\nSaid Krishna: "How canst thou speak in such a manner, O Duryodhana? How canst\nthou pretend that thou didst never wrong thy kinsmen? Be mindful of thine evil\nthoughts and deeds."\n\nDuhsasana whispered to his elder brother: "I fear, if thou dost not make peace\nwith the Pandavas, the elders will seize thee and send thee as a prisoner to\n\np. 281\n\n[paragraph continues] Yudhishthira. They desire to make thee and me and Karna\nto kneel before the Pandavas."\n\nAngry was Duryodhana, and he rose and left the council chamber. Duhsasana and\nKarna and Shakuni followed him.\n\nKrishna then turned to Dhritarashtra and said: "Thou shouldst arrest these\nfour rebellious princes and act freely and justly towards the Pandavas."\n\nThe weak old maharajah was stricken with grief, and he sent Vidura for his\nelder son. Then came Queen Gandhari and remonstrated with Duryodhana; but when\nshe had spoken he answered not, and went away again.\n\nShakuni and Karna and Duhsasana waited outside for Duryodhana, and they\nplotted to lay hands on Krishna so that the power of the Pandavas might be\nweakened. But to Krishna came knowledge of their thoughts, and he informed the\nelders who were there.\n\nOnce again the maharajah summoned Duryodhana before him, and Krishna said:\n"Ah! thou of little understanding, is it thy desire to take me captive? Know\nnow that I am not alone here, for all the gods and holy beings are with me."\n\nHaving spoken thus, Krishna suddenly revealed himself in divine splendour. His\nbody was transformed into a tongue of flame; gods and divine beings appeared\nabout him; fire issued from his mouth and eyes and ears; sparks broke from his\nskin, which became as radiant as the sun. . . .\n\nAll the rajahs closed their eyes; they trembled when an earthquake shook the\npalace. But Duryodhana remained defiant.\n\nKrishna, having resumed his human form, then bade farewell to the maharajah,\nwho lamented the doings of Duryodhana. The divine one spake and said: "O\n\np. 282\n\n[paragraph continues] Dhritarashtra, thee I forgive freely; but alas! a father\nis often cursed by the people because of the wicked doings of his own son."\n\nEre Krishna left the city he met Karna and spake to him, saying: "Come with\nme, and the Pandavas will regard thee as their elder brother, and thou wilt\nbecome the king."\n\nSaid Karna: "Although Duryodhana is a rajah, he rules according to my counsel.\n. . . I know, without doubt, that a great battle is pending which will cover\nthe earth with blood. Terrible are the omens. Calamity awaits the Kauravas. .\n. . Yet I cannot desert those who have given me their friendship. Besides, if\nI went with thee now, men would regard me as Arjuna\'s inferior. Arjuna and I\nmust meet in battle, and fate will decide who is the greater. I know I shall\nfall in this war, but I must fight for my friends. . . . O mighty one, may we\nmeet on earth again. If not, may we meet in heaven."\n\nThen Krishna and Karna embraced one another, and each went his own way.\n\nVidura spake to Pritha, mother of the Pandavas, and said: "O mother of living\nsons, my desire is ever for peace, but although I cry myself hoarse,\nDuryodhana will not listen to my words. Dhritarashtra is old, yet he doth not\nwork for peace; he is intoxicated with pride for his sons. When Krishna\nreturneth to the Pandavas, war will certainly break out; the sin of the\nKauravas will cause much bloodshed. I cannot sleep, thinking of approaching\ndisaster."\n\nPritha sighed and wept. "Fie to wealth!" she said, "that it should cause\nkinsmen to slaughter one another. War should be waged between foemen, not\nfriends. If the Pandavas do not fight, they will suffer poverty; if they go to\nwar and win, the destruction of kinsmen will\n\np. 283\n\nnot bring triumph. My heart is full of sorrow. And alas! it is Karna who\nsupports Duryodhana in his folly; he hath again become powerful."\n\nPritha lamented the folly of her girlhood which caused Karna to be, and she\nwent forth to look for him. She found her son bathing in sacred waters, and\nshe spoke, saying: "Thou art mine own son, and thy sire is Surya. I hid thee\nat birth, and Radha, who found thee, is not thy mother. It is not seemly that\nthou shouldst in ignorance plot with Duryodhana against thine own brethren.\nLet the Kauravas this day behold the friendship of thee and Arjuna. If you two\nwere side by side you would conquer the world. My eldest son, it is meet that\nthou shouldst be with thy brethren now. Be no longer known as one of lowly\nbirth."\n\nA voice spoke from the sun, saying: "What Pritha hath said is truth. O tiger\namong men, great good will be accomplished if thou wilt obey her command."\n\nKarna remained steadfast, for his heart was full of honour. He said unto\nPritha, his mother: "O lady, it is now too late to command my obedience. Why\ndidst thou abandon me at birth? If I am a Kshatriya, I have been deprived of\nmy rank. No foeman could have done me a greater injury than thou hast done.\nThou hast never been a mother to me, nor do thy sons know I am their brother.\nHow can I now desert the Kauravas, who trust in me in waging this war. I am\ntheir boat on which to cross a stormy sea. . . . I will speak without deceit\nunto thee. For the sake of Duryodhana I will combat against thy sons. I cannot\nforget his kindness; I cannot forget mine own honour. Thy command cannot now\nbe obeyed by me. Yet thy solicitation to me will not be fruitless. I have\npower to slay Yudhishthira, and Bhima, and Nakula, and Sahadeva,\n\np. 284\n\nbut I promise they shall not fall by my hand. I will fight with Arjuna alone.\nIf I slay Arjuna, I will achieve great fame; if I am slain by him, I will be\ncovered with glory."\n\nSaid Pritha: "Thou hast pledged the lives of four of thy brethren. Be that\nremembered to thee in the perils of battle. Blessed be thou, and let health be\ngiven thee."\n\nKarna said: "So be it," and then they parted, the mother going one way and the\nson another.\n\nAfter this the Pandavas and Kauravas gathered together their mighty armies and\nmarched to the field of battle.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVIII.
