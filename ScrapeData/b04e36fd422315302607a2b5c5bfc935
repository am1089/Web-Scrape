(The pra _n_ a is Brahman), on account of the trembling (predicated of\nthe whole world).\n\nThe discussion of qualification for Brahma-knowledge--on which we entered as\nan opportunity offered--being finished we return to our chief topic, i.e. the\nenquiry into the purport of the Vedanta-texts.--We read (Ka. Up. II, 6, 2),\n'Whatever there is, the whole world when gone forth trembles in the pra _n_ a.\nIt (the pra _n_ a) is a great terror, a raised thunderbolt. Those who know it\nbecome immortal  1.'--This passage declares that this whole world trembles,\nabiding in pra _n_ a, and that there is raised something very terrible, called\na thunderbolt, and that through its knowledge immortality is obtained. But as\nit is not immediately clear what the pra _n_ a is, and what that terrible\nthunderbolt, a discussion arises.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that, in accordance with the ordinary meaning of\nthe term, pra _n_ a denotes the air with its five modifications, that the word\n'thunderbolt' also is to be taken in its ordinary sense, and that thus the\nwhole passage contains a glorification of air. For, he says, this whole world\ntrembles, abiding within air with its five forms--which is here called pra _n_\na--and the terrible thunderbolts also spring from air (or wind) as their\ncause. For in the air, people say, when it manifests itself in the form of Par\n_g_ anya, lightning, thunder, rain, and thunderbolts manifest themselves.--\nThrough the knowledge of that air immortality\n\np. 230\n\nalso can be obtained; for another scriptural passage says, 'Air is everything\nby itself, and air is all things together. He who knows this conquers death.'\n--We therefore conclude that the same air is to be understood in the passage\nunder discussion.\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--Brahman only can be meant, on account of\nwhat precedes as well as what follows. In the preceding as well as the\nsubsequent part of the chapter Brahman only is spoken of; how then can it be\nsupposed that in the intermediate part all at once the air should be referred\nto? The immediately preceding passage runs as follows, 'That only is called\nthe Bright, that is called Brahman, that alone is called the Immortal. All\nworlds are contained in it, and no one goes beyond it.' That the Brahman there\nspoken of forms the topic of our passage also, we conclude, firstly, from\nproximity; and, secondly, from the circumstance that in the clause, 'The whole\nworld trembles in pra _n_ a we recognise a quality of Brahman, viz. its\nconstituting the abode of the whole world. That the word pra _n_ a can denote\nthe highest Self also, appears from such passages as 'the pra _n_ a of pra _n_\na' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 18). Being the cause of trembling, moreover, is a\nquality which, properly appertains to the highest Self only, not to mere air.\nThus Scripture says, 'No mortal lives by the pra _n_ a and the breath that\ngoes down. We live by another in whom these two repose' (Ka. Up. II, 5, 5).\nAnd also in the passage subsequent to the one under discussion, ('From terror\nof it fire burns, from terror the sun burns, from terror Indra and Vayu, and\nDeath as the fifth run away,') Brahman, and not the air, must be supposed to\nbe spoken of, since the subject of that passage is represented as the cause of\nfear on the part of the whole world inclusive of the air itself. Thence we\nagain conclude that the passage under discussion also refers to Brahman,\nfirstly, on the ground of proximity; and, secondly, because we recognise a\nquality of Brahman, viz. its being the cause of fear, in the words, 'A great\nterror, a raised thunderbolt.' The word 'thunderbolt' is here used to denote a\ncause of fear in general. Thus in ordinary life also a man strictly\n\np. 231\n\ncarries out a king's command because he fearfully considers in his mind, 'A\nthunderbolt (i.e. the king's wrath, or threatened punishment) is hanging over\nmy head; it might fall if I did not carry out his command.' In the same manner\nthis whole world inclusive of fire, air, sun, and so on, regularly carries on\nits manifold functions from fear of Brahman; hence Brahman as inspiring fear\nis compared to a thunderbolt. Similarly, another scriptural passage, whose\ntopic is Brahman, declares, 'From terror of it the wind blows, from terror the\nsun rises; from terror of it Agni and Indra, yea, Death runs as the fifth.'--\nThat Brahman is what is referred to in our passage, further follows from the\ndeclaration that the fruit of its cognition is immortality. For that\nimmortality is the fruit of the knowledge of Brahman is known, for instance,\nfrom the mantra, 'A man who knows him only passes over death, there is no\nother path to go' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 15).--That immortality which the\npurvapakshin asserts to be sometimes represented as the fruit of the knowledge\nof the air is a merely relative one; for there (i.e. in the chapter from which\nthe passage is quoted) at first the highest Self is spoken of, by means of a\nnew topic being started (B _ri_. Up. III, 4), and thereupon the inferior\nnature of the air and so on is referred to. ('Everything else is evil.')--That\nin the passage under discussion the highest Self is meant appears finally from\nthe general subject-matter; for the question (asked by Na _k_ iketas in I, 2,\n14, 'That which thou seest as neither this nor that, as neither effect nor\ncause, as neither past nor future tell me that') refers to the highest Self.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[229:1](sbe34108.htm#fr_230) As the words stand in the original they might be\ntranslated as follows (and are so translated by the purvapakshin), 'Whatever\nthere is, the whole world trembles in the pra _n_ a, there goes forth (from\nit) a great terror, viz. the raised thunderbolt.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 40](sbe34109.htm)\n\n"
