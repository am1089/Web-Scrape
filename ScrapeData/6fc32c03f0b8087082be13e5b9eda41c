The sacred law is taught in each Veda. 1\n\n2\\. We will explain (it) in accordance with that.\n\n3\\. (The sacred law), taught in the Tradition (Sm _ri_ ti, stands) second. 3\n\n4\\. The practice of the _S_ ish _t_ as (stands) third. 4\n\n5\\. _S_ ish _t_ as, forsooth, (are those) who are free from envy, free from\npride, contented with a store of grain sufficient for ten days, free from\ncovetousness, and free from hypocrisy, arrogance, greed, perplexity, and\nanger. 5\n\n6\\. '(Those are called) _S_ ish _t_ as who, in accordance with the sacred law,\nhave studied the Veda together 6\n\np. 144\n\nwith its appendages, know how to draw inferences from that, (and) are able to\nadduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed texts.'\n\n7\\. On failure of them, an assembly consisting at least of ten members (shall\ndecide disputed points of law).\n\n8\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Four men, who each know one\nof the four Vedas, a Mima _m_ saka, one who knows the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas, one who recites\n(the works on) the sacred law, and three Brahma _n_ as belonging to (three\ndifferent) orders, (constitute) an assembly consisting, at least, of ten\nmembers.' 8\n\n9\\. 'There may be five, or there may be three, or there may be one blameless\nman, who decides (questions regarding) the sacred law. But a thousand fools\n(can)not (do it).' 9\n\n10\\. 'As an elephant made of wood, as an antelope made of leather, such is an\nunlearned Brahma _n_ a: those three having nothing but the name (of their\nkind).' 10\n\np. 145\n\n11\\. 'That sin which dunces, perplexed by ignorance and unacquainted with the\nsacred law, declare (to be duty), falls, increased a hundredfold, on those who\npropound it.' 11\n\n12\\. 'Narrow and difficult to find is the path of the sacred law, towards\nwhich many gates lead. Hence, if there is a doubt, it must not be propounded\nby one man (only), however learned he may be.' 12\n\n13\\. 'What Brahma _n_ as, riding in the chariot of the law (and) wielding the\nsword of the Veda, propound even in jest, that is declared to be the highest\nlaw.'\n\n14\\. 'As wind and sun will make water, collected on a stone, disappear, even\nso the sin that (cleaves) to an offender completely vanishes like water.' 14\n\n15\\. 'He who knows the sacred law shall fix the penances with discernment,\ntaking into consideration the constitution, the strength, the knowledge, and\nthe age (of the offender), as well as the time and the deed.' 15\n\np. 146\n\n16\\. Many thousands (of Brahma _n_ as) cannot form a (legal) assembly (for\ndeclaring the sacred law), if they have not fulfilled their sacred duties, are\nunacquainted with the Veda, and subsist only by the name of their caste.' 16\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[143:1](sbe1434.htm#fr_729) **I**. Vasish _th_ a I, 4. Each Veda, i.e. each\n_s_ akha or redaction of the Veda.--Govinda.\n\n[143:3](sbe1434.htm#fr_730) Vasish _th_ a I, 4. Govinda takes sm _ri_ ti, 'the\ntradition,' in the sense of works (grantha) explaining the recollections of\nthe _Ri_ shis, and is no doubt right in doing so.\n\n[143:4](sbe1434.htm#fr_731) Vasish _th_ a I, 5. The explanation of agama by\n'practice' rests on the authority of Govinda and the parallel passages where\n_s_ ila and a _k_ ara, 'conduct,' are used.\n\n[143:5](sbe1434.htm#fr_732) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 7, 20, 8; Gautama XXVIII, 48.\nKumbhidhanya, translated according to Govinda by 'contented with a store of\ngrain sufficient for ten days,' means, according to others, 'contented with a\nstore of grain sufficient for six days or for a year.'\n\n[143:6](sbe1434.htm#fr_733) Vasish _th_ a VI, 43. Govinda omits the word\n'iti,' given by the p. 144 MSS. after the verse, whereby it is marked as a\nquotation. 'The appendages,' i.e. the Itihasas and Pura _n_ as.--Govinda.\n\n[144:8](sbe1434.htm#fr_734) Vasish _th_ a III, 20. Govinda, quoting Gautama\nXXVIII, 49, says that Vanaprasthas cannot serve as members of Parishads,\nbecause they live in the forest. He also notices a different reading, not\nfound in my MSS. '\xc3\x82 _s_ ramasthas trayo mukhya _h_.' He asserts that thereby\nprofessed students are intended, because professed students are declared to be\nparticularly holy in the Dharmaskandha-brahmana.\n\n[144:9](sbe1434.htm#fr_735) Vasish _th_ a III, 7. Itare, translated by\n'fools,' means literally, those different from the persons enumerated in the\npreceding verse.' Govinda remarks that according to Sutra 12 one learned\nBrahma _n_ a must be taken only in cases of the most pressing necessity.\n\n[144:10](sbe1434.htm#fr_736) Vasish _th_ a III, 11.\n\n[145:11](sbe1434.htm#fr_737) Vasish _th_ a III, 6.\n\n[145:12](sbe1434.htm#fr_738) The 'gates' of the sacred law are the Vedas, the\nSm _ri_ tis, and the practice of the Sish _t_ as. They are many, because the\nredactions of the Vedas and Sm _ri_ tis are numerous and the practices vary in\ndifferent countries.\n\n[145:14](sbe1434.htm#fr_739) I.e. provided the offender performs the penance\nimposed by learned and virtuous Brahma _n_ as. Pra _n_ a _s_ ayet, 'will make\ndisappear,' is ungrammatical, as the subject stands in the dual. Grammatical\naccuracy has probably been sacrificed to the exigencies of the metre.\n\n[145:15](sbe1434.htm#fr_740) Vasish _th_ a XIX, 9. _S_ ariram, literally 'the\nbody,' means here the constitution, which may be bilious, 'windy,' and so\nforth. \xc3\x82yu _h_ , literally 'life' or 'long life,' has been translated by\n'knowledge,' in accordance with Govinda's explanation _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anam. As the\nword vaya _h_ , 'age,' also occurs in this verse, it is clear that ayu _h_\ncannot have its usual meaning.\n\n[146:16](sbe1434.htm#fr_741) Vasish _th_ a III, 5. The two copies of the\ncommentary omit this Sutra, though it is quoted in the explanation of Sutra 9.\nThe best MSS. repeat the last words of the Sutra in order to show that the Ka\n_n_ _d_ ika ends here. The same practice is observed, though not quite\nregularly, in the sequel.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Adhyaya 1, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 2](sbe1435.htm)\n\n"
