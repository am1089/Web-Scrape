On account of the difference of words.\n\nThe clause 'That is the Self of me, within the heart' designates the embodied\nsoul by means of a genitive form, while the object of meditation is exhibited\nin the nominative case. Similarly, a text of the Va _g_ asaneyins, which\ntreats of the same topic, applies different terms to the embodied and the\nhighest Self, 'Like a rice grain, or a barley grain, or a canary seed, or the\nkernel of a canary seed, thus that golden Person is within the Self' ( _S_ at.\nBr. X, 6, 3, 2). Here the locative form, 'within the Self,' denotes the\nembodied Self, and the nominative, 'that golden Person,' the object to be\nmeditated on.--All this proves the highest Self to be the object of\nmeditation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 6.
