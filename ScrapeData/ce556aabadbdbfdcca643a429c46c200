Suta said :\xc2\x97Thus S\xc2\x92antanu married Satyavati; two sons were born to her\nand they died in course of time. Out of Vyasa Deva's semen, Dhritarastra was\nborn. Ambika Devi, the mother of Dhritarastra closed her eyes on seeing Veda\nVyasa; hence Dhritarastra was born blind. Seeing Dhritarastra blind Satyavati\nasked Vyasa to go to Ambalika (Pan _d_ u's mother); the princess Ambalika,\nmother of Pan _d_ u turned pale at the sight of Vyasa; hence her son became of\na pale colour out of Vyasa's wrath. Hence the name of the son was Pan _d_ u.\nNext the maid servant, expert in the science of amorous pleasures, satisfied\nVyasa; hence her son Vidura was born of Dharma's part and became truthful and\nholy. Though Pan _d_ u was younger, the ministers installed him on the throne.\nDhritarastra could not become king, as he was blind. By the permission of\nBhisma the powerful Pan _d_ u obtained the sovereignty; and the intelligent\nVidura became his minister. Dhritarastra had two wives Gandhari and Sauvali;\nthis Sauvali was Vaishya; she was engaged in the household affairs. The king\nPan _d_ u had two wives, too; the first was Kunti, the daughter of Surasena;\nand the other was Madri, the daughter of the Madra king. Gandhari gave birth\nto one hundred beautiful sons; Vais'ya Sauvali gave birth to one beautiful son\nnamed Yuyutsu. While Kunti was a virgin, she gave birth, through the medium of\nthe Sun, the lovely Karna; next he became the wife of Pan _d_ u. Hearing this,\nthe Ri _s_ is said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni Suta! What are you saying ? First Kunti brought\nforth a child and afterwards she was married to Pan _d_ u; this\n\n\n\np. 95\n\n\n\nis wonderful, indeed! How was Karna, born of Kunti, unmarried? and how came\nKunti to be married afterwards? describe all these in detail.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n13-35. Suta then said :-- \xc2\x93O Dvija! While Surasena's daughter Kunti was a\nvirgin girl, the king Kuntibhoja asked for Kunti that she might become her\ngirl and Surasena gave her to the king Kuntibhoja who brought up this\nbeautifully smiling girl. He put to her the service of Agni of Agnihotra.\nOnce, on an occassion, Durvasa Muni, engaged in the vow, lasting for four\nmonths, came there; Kunti served him during that period; the Muni became\ngreatly pleased and gave her a very auspicious, mantra, by virtue of which any\nDeva, when called upon by that mantra will come to Kunti and satisfy her\ndesires. When the Muni went away, Kunti, remaining in her house, wanted to\ntest the accuracy of the mantra and asked within herself \xc2\x93What Devata to call\nupon.\xc2\x94 Seeing the God Surya had arisen in the sky, Kunti uttered the Mantra\nand invoked him. The Sun, then, assuming an excellent human form, came down\nfrom the Heavens and appeared before Kunti in the same room. Seeing the Deva\nSun, Kunti became greatly surprised and began to shudder and instantly became\nendowed with the inherent natural quality of passion (had menstruation). The\nbeautiful-eyed Kunti, with folded palm; spoke to Surya Deva standing before\n:-- \xc2\x93I am highly pleased to-day seeing Thy form; now go back to Thy sphere.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nSurya Deva said :-- \xc2\x93O Kunti! What for you called me, by virtue of the Mantra?\nCalling me, why do you not worship me, standing before you? O beautiful blue\none! Seeing you, I have become passionate; so come to me. By means of the\nmantra, you have made me your subservient so take me for intercourse.\xc2\x94 Hearing\nthis, Kunti said :-- \xc2\x93O Witness of all! O knower of Dharma! You know that I am\na virgin girl. O Suvrata! I bow down to you; I am a family daughter; so do not\nspeak ill to me.\xc2\x94 Surya then said :-- \xc2\x93If I go away __ in vain, I will be an\nobject of great shame, and, no doubt, will be laughed amongst the gods; So, O\nKunti! If you do not satisfy me, I will immediately curse you and the Brahmi\n_n_ who has given you this mantra. O Beautiful one! If you satisfy me, your\nvirginity will remain; no body will come to know and there will be born a son\nto you, exactly like me.\xc2\x94 Thus saying Surya Deva enjoyed the bashful Kunti,\nwith her mind attracted towards him; He granted her the desired boons and went\naway. The beautiful Kunti became pregnant and began to remain in a house,\nunder great secrecy. Only the dear nurse knew that; her mother or any other\nperson was quite unaware of the fact. In time, a very beautiful son like the\nsecond Sun and Kartikeya, decked with a lovely Kavacha coat of mail and two\near-rings, was born there. Then the nurse caught hold\n\n\n\np. 96\n\n\n\nof the hand of the bashful Kunti and said :-- \xc2\x93O Charming one! What care can\nyou possibly have as long as I am living.\xc2\x94 Kunti then, placed the son in a box\nand said :-- \xc2\x93O son! What shall I do? Being afraid of shame, I am leaving you,\nthough you are dear to me as my life itself! I am exceedingly fortunate that I\nam casting aside this all auspicious son. May the attributeless Bhagavati\nAmbika, the World Mother and the Lady of all, endowed with attributes, protect\nThee! May Katyayani, the giver of all desires, feed you with Her milk! Alas! I\nam quitting you, born of Surya\xc2\x92s semen in this solitary forest like a vitiated\nwanton woman. I do not know, when shall I see your lotus like beautiful face,\ndearest to me like my self. Alas! I never worshipped in my former birth\nS\xc2\x92ivani, the mother of the three worlds; I never meditated Her lotus like\nfeet, the Giver of all happiness; hence I am so very unfortunate. O Dear son!\nI must perform great tapasya to expiate for this terrible sin, that I\nknowingly commit in relinquishing you in the forest.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n36-48. Suta said :-- Thus saying to the son within the casket, Kunti gave over\nthat to the hands of her nurse, terrified, lest some one might see her. Kunti\nthen bathed and remained with a fearful heart in her father's house. A\ncarpenter (charioteer?) named Adhiratha got accidentally that casket floating\nin the Ganges. The carpenter's wife Radha, prayed for the son and nourished\nhim under her care. Thus nourished in the carpenter's house, the famous\nKunti's son Karna became a very powerful warrior. The king Pan _d_ u then\nmarried Kunti in a Svayamvara, a marriage in which the girl chooses her\nhusband from among a number of suitors, assembled together. And the all\nauspicious daughter of the king of Madra became also the second wife of Pan\n_d_ u. Once, on an occasion, the powerful Pan _d_ u, while hunting in the\nforest killed a Muni, in the form of a deer, engaged in the act of co-\nhabitation, thinking it to be a deer. The dying Muni became inflated with\nwrath, cursed Pan _d_ u :-- \xc2\x93If you co-habit, certainly you will die.\xc2\x94 Thus\ncursed by the Muni, Pan _d_ u became very sorrowful and abandoned his kingdom\nand began to live in the forest. O Munis! His two wives Kunti and Madri,\nfollowed their husband as chaste women do, to serve him in the forest.\nDwelling in the hermitage of the Munis, Pan _d_ u listened to the Dharma\nS\xc2\x92astras and practised severe penance. Once while he was listening to the\nreligious discourses of the Munis, he heard unmistakeably the Munis telling\nthat the man who is sonless can never go to the Heavens; so he must get a son\nsomehow or other. The Pundits declare that the sons born of the father's\nsemen, the sons born of their daughters, the K _s_ ettraja, the Goloka, the\nKun _d_ a, the Sahoda, the Kanina, the Krita, one obtained in the forest, or\none offered by another father, unable to\n\n\n\np. 97\n\n\n\nnourish his son, all are entitled to inherit the wealth of the father; but the\nsons, enumerated successively are more and more inferior.\n\n\n\nN.B.: Ksettraja - of a son, the off spring of the wife by a kinsman appointed\nto procreate issue to the husband.\n\nGoloka - Bastard child of a widow.\n\nKunda - a child born in adultery.\n\nSahoda - the son of a woman pregnant at the time of marriage.\n\nKanina - the son born of a young and unmarried woman.\n\nKrita - purchased\n\n\n\n49-52. Hearing this, Pan _d_ u spoke to the lotus-eyed Kunti to procreate sons\nfor him soon by a great ascetic Muni :-- \xc2\x93By my order, you will not incur any\nsin in doing this. I heard that in ancient times the high souled kin Saudasa\ngot son from Vas'i _st_ ha.\xc2\x94 Kunti, then spoke to the king :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! I know\none Siddha mantra; it was given to me before by the Muni Durvasa. Whichever\nDevata I will invoke by that Mantra, he will instantly come to my side,\ncontrolled by that Mantra.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n53-71. At the request of the husband, Kunti invoked Dharma, the best of the\nDevas; and after being impregnated by him, gave birth to Yudhis _t_ hira. Then\nshe got through Pavana Deva, the son Vrikodara; and through Indra the Lord of\nthe Devas, Arju _n_ a. Thus, in every year, Kunti gave birth to one son and so\nin three years she gave birth to three very powerful and mighty sons. At this\nMadri spoke to her husband :-- \xc2\x93O king, the best of the Kurus! What shall I do\nnow? Kindly suggest to me the means of procreating sons; O Lord, remove my\npain.\xc2\x94 Pan _d_ u asked Kunti for this; Kunti, moved with pity, gave her the\nmantra, so that she might get one son. Then the beautiful Madri, invoked the\ntwin As'vin under the advice of her husband and got a pair of twins Nakula and\nSahadeva through them. O Munis! Thus five Pa _nd_ avas were born successively\nin every following year to the wives of Pan _d_ u by the seed of the Devas.\nOnce on a time Pan _d_ u, whose end was drawing nigh became very passionate at\nthe sight of Madri in that solitary hermitage. He, though forbidden repeatedly\nby Madri, warmly embraced her, as if dictated by the great destroyer, and fell\nto the ground. As the creeper falls down when the tree is felled, so Madri\ndropped on the ground and began to cry violently. Having heard the wailings of\nMadri, Kunti and the five sons of Pan _d_ u came there weeping and crying; a\ntumult then ensued and the great Munis also appeared on the scene. Then those\nMunis, practising great vows, knew that Pan _d_ u was dead and performed duly,\non the banks of the Ganges, the ceremony of burning the dead.\n\n\n\np. 98\n\n\n\nAt that time Madri gave over to Kunti the charge of her two sons and followed\nthe Sati practice along with her husband to go to Satyaloka.\n\n\n\nThe Munis, then, performed Tarpa _n_ a ceremonies in honour of Pan _d_ u and\nMadri and took Kunti and the five sons to Hastinapur. Knowing that Kunti has\ncome, Bhisma, Vidura and the relatives of Dhritarastra within the city, all\ncame to Kunti. They all asked Kunti :-- \xc2\x93O beautiful one! Whose are these five\nsons?\xc2\x94 Kunti, then, remembered the curse on Pan _d_ u and sorrowfully\nexpressed :-- \xc2\x93 These are the Deva's sons born in Kuru family.\xc2\x94 In order to\nconvince the people assembled there, Kunti invoked the Devas who came in the\ncelestial space above and said :-- \xc2\x93Yes, these are the sons born of our\nseeds.\xc2\x94 Bhisma, then, paid respect to the words of the Devas and honoured duly\nthe boys. Bhisma then took the five sons and Pan _d_ u's wife to Hastina and\ngladly nourished them. O Munis! The sons of Pritha were thus born and\nnourished by Bhisma.\n\nThus ends the sixth chapter of the second Adhyaya on the birth of the Pa _nd_\navas in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 7](bk02ch07.htm)\n\n"
