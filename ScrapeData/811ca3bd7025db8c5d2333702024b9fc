His father said to him, 'What priests hast thou chosen to\nofficiate?' He said, 'This Vai _s_ vavasavya here is my Hot _ri_.' He asked\nhim, 'Knowest thou, Brahma _n_ a Vai _s_ vavasavya,--\n\n10:3:4:22\\. The four great (things)?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest\nthou the four great ones of the great?'--'I know them, sir,' he\nsaid.--'Knowest thou the four rites (vrata)?'--'I know them, sir,' he\nsaid.--'Knowest thou the four rites of rites?'--'I know them, sir,' he\nsaid.--'Knowest thou the\n\np. 334\n\nfour relating to Ka 1?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest thou the four\ndeepest of those relating to Ka 2?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest\nthou the four flames 3?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest thou the four\nflames of flames?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.\n\n10:3:4:33\\. 'Knowest thou the Arka 4?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us 5,\nsir!'--'Knowest thou the two Arka-leaves?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us,\nsir!'--'Knowest thou the two Arka-flowers?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us,\nsir!'--'Knowest thou the two pod-leaves 6 of the Arka?'--'Nay, but thou wilt\nteach us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the two coops 7 of the Arka?'--'Nay, but thou\nwilt teach us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the Arka-grains?'--'Nay, but thou wilt\nteach us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the bulge 8 of\n\np. 335\n\nthe Arka?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the root of the\nArka?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us, sir!'\n\n10:3:4:44\\. Now, when he said, 'Knowest thou the four great (things)? Knowest\nthou the four great of the great?'--the great one is Agni (the fire), and the\ngreat (thing) of that great one are the plants and trees, for they are his\nfood; and the great one is Vayu (the wind), and the great (thing) of that\ngreat one are the waters, for they are his (the wind's) food; and the great\none is \xc3\x82ditya (the sun), and the great (thing) of that great one is the moon,\nfor that is his food; and the great one is Man, and the great (thing) of that\ngreat one is cattle, for they are his food:--these are the four great things,\nthese the four great of the great;--these are the four rites, these the four\nrites of rites;--these are the four relating to Ka, these the four deepest\nrelating to Ka;--these are the four flames, these the four flames of flames.\n\n10:3:4:55\\. And when he said, 'Knowest thou the Arka?' he thereby meant\nman;--'Knowest thou the two Arka-leaves?' he thereby meant his ears;--'Knowest\nthou the two Arka-flowers?' he thereby meant his eyes;--'Knowest thou the pod-\nleaves of the Arka?' he thereby meant his nostrils;--'Knowest thou the two\ncoops of the Arka?' he thereby meant his lips;--'Knowest thou the Arka-\ngrains?' he thereby meant his teeth;--'Knowest thou the bulge of the Arka?' he\nthereby meant his tongue;--'Knowest thou the root of the Arka?'\n\np. 336\n\nhe thereby meant his food. Now that Arka, to wit, man, is Agni; and verily,\nwhoso regards Agni as the Arka and the man, in his (altar-) body that Agni,\nthe Arka, will be built up even through the knowledge that 'I here am Agni,\nthe Arka.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[333:2](sbe4359.htm#fr_648) That is, grandson of Aru _n_ a (Aupave _s_ i), and\nson of (Uddalaka) \xc3\x82ru _n_ i (II, 3, I, 35. 34; IV, 5, 7, 9).\n\n[334:1](sbe4359.htm#fr_649) Saya _n_ a takes 'kya' to mean 'those useful to,\nor pleasing to (hita), Ka, i.e. Pra _g_ apati.'\n\n[334:2](sbe4359.htm#fr_650) Literally, 'the four Kya of the Kya.' For more\nsymbolical speculation on these terms, see [X, 4, 1, 4](sbe4361.htm#10:4:1:4).\n\n[334:3](sbe4359.htm#fr_651) Or, fires (arka), used of the sun, the fire and\nthe lightning, as well as of the Arka plant. Saya _n_ a, however, here\nexplains 'arka _h_ ' by 'ar _k_ aniya _h_ ,' 'worthy of being praised, or\nhonoured.'\n\n[334:4](sbe4359.htm#fr_652) That is, the Arka plant (Calotropis gigantea),\napparently so called (= 'arka,' lightning) from the wedge-like shape of its\nleaves. Cf. [IX, 1, 1, 4](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:4), where the leaf is used in\noffering the _S_ atarudriya oblations. The other meanings of 'arka,'\nespecially that of 'flame, fire,' however, are likewise implied in these\nmystic speculations.\n\n[334:5](sbe4359.htm#fr_653) Or, simply, 'Thou wilt tell us, then (atha vai),\nsir.'\n\n[334:6](sbe4359.htm#fr_654) ? Or, the pods, sheaths; arkako _s_ yau ko _s_\nyakare phale (or pu _t_ ake). Saya _n_ a.\n\n[334:7](sbe4359.htm#fr_655) ? Or, 'seas' (samudra). Saya _n_ a explains it as\ntwo opened 'lip-parts' at the top of the Arka-pod (arkako _s_ agre vidalitaush\n_th_ abhagau).\n\n[334:8](sbe4359.htm#fr_656) That is, according to the St. Petersb. Dict., 'the\nglobular, cake-shaped, hardened cicatrix of the Calotropis gigantea.' Saya _n_\na p. 335 explains it by, 'arkako _s_ amadhye vistare _n_ a (? v. l. gihvastara\n_n_ a-) vartamana tuli.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 3, 5. Fifth Brahma _n_ a](sbe4360.htm)\n\n"
