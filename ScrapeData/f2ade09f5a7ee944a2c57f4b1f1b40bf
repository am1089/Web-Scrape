All this is Brahman (n.) Let a man meditate on that (visible world) as\nbeginning, ending, and breathing 1 in it (the Brahman).\n\nNow man is a creature of will. According to what his will is in this world, so\nwill he be when he has departed this life. Let him therefore have this will\nand belief:\n\n2\\. The intelligent, whose body is spirit, whose form is light, whose thoughts\nare true, whose nature is like ether (omnipresent and invisible), from whom\nall works, all desires, all sweet odours and tastes proceed; he who embraces\nall this, who never speaks, and is never surprised,\n\n3\\. He is my self within the heart, smaller than a corn of rice, smaller than\na corn of barley, smaller than a mustard seed, smaller than a canary seed or\nthe kernel of a canary seed. He also is my self within the heart, greater than\nthe earth, greater than the sky, greater than heaven, greater than all these\nworlds.\n\n4\\. He from whom all works, all desires, all sweet odours and tastes proceed,\nwho embraces all this, who never speaks and who is never surprised, he, my\nself within the heart, is that Brahman (n.) When I shall have departed from\nhence, I shall obtain him (that Self). He who has this faith 2 has no doubt;\nthus said _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya 3, yea, thus he said.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[48:1](sbe01072.htm#fr_180) _G_ alan is explained by _g_ a, born, la,\nabsorbed, and an, breathing. It is an artificial term, but fully recognised by\nthe Vedanta school, and always explained in this manner.\n\n[48:2](sbe01072.htm#fr_181) Or he who has faith and no doubt, will obtain\nthis.\n\n[48:3](sbe01072.htm#fr_182) This chapter is frequently quoted as the _S_ a _n_\n_d_ ilya-vidya, Vedantasara, init; Vedanta-sutra III, 3, 31.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 15](sbe01073.htm)\n\n'
