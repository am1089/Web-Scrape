He then offers these Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ akratus 1 (sacrificial rites),\nwith,' May the Agni and the Gharma (prosper) for me!'--by these sacrificial\nrites he thus gratifies him, and by these sacrificial rites he thus\nconsecrates him.\n\n9:3:3:22\\. He then offers (the libations relating to) the Uneven Stomas\n2;--for the gods, having now obtained their desires, by means of the uneven\nStomas went up to heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, now that he\nhas obtained all his desires, by means of the uneven Stomas go up to heaven.\n\n9:3:3:33\\. Now this (set runs) up to the thirty-three-versed (hymn-form), for\nthe Trayastri _m_ _s_ a is the last of the uneven Stomas: at the last the gods\nthus\n\np. 218\n\nwent up to heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby at the last\ngo up to heaven.\n\n9:3:3:44\\. He then offers (those relating to) the Even (Stomas) 1;--for the\nmetres then said, 'The uneven stomas are worn out, by means of the even ones\nwe will go up to heaven!' By means of the even stomas they went up to heaven;\nand in like manner does the Sacrificer thus, by means of the even stomas, go\nup to heaven.\n\n9:3:3:55\\. This (set runs) up to the forty-eight-versed (hymn-form), for the\nAsh _t_ a _k_ atvari _m_ _s_ a is the last of the even stomas: at the last the\nmetres thus went up to heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby\nat the last go up to heaven.\n\n9:3:3:66\\. He says, 'May the One and the Three (prosper) for me!'--'May the\nFour and the Eight (prosper) for me!'--even as one climbing a tree would climb\nup by taking hold of an ever higher branch, so is this. And as to why he\noffers the Stomas,--the stomas are food: it is with food he thus consecrates\nhim.\n\n9:3:3:77\\. He then offers (the libations relating to) the Age-grades 2 (of\ncattle),--age-grades mean cattle: it is by cattle, for his food, that he thus\ngratifies\n\np. 219\n\nhim; and by cattle, for his food, he thus consecrates him.\n\n9:3:3:88\\. He then offers whilst mentioning names 1;--for the gods, having\nobtained all their wishes, now gratified him directly; and in like manner does\nthe Sacrificer, having obtained all his wishes, now gratify him directly. 'To\nStrength, hail! to Gain, hail!'--these are his (Agni's) names: it is by\nmentioning his names that he thus gratifies him.\n\n9:3:3:99\\. There are thirteen of these names,--a year consists of thirteen\nmonths, and the layers and fillings of the fire-altar amount to thirteen: as\ngreat as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus gratifies\nhim. And as to why he offers while mentioning names,--it is thus in mentioning\nhis (Agni's) names that he consecrates him.\n\n9:3:3:1010\\. He then says, 'This is thy realm; a supporter and sustainer art\nthou for the friend: for sustenance, for rain, for the lordship of creatures\n(do I consecrate) thee;'--sustenance, doubtless, means food, and rain means\nfood: by food he thus gratifies him.\n\n9:3:3:1111\\. And when he says, 'This is thy realm; a supporter and sustainer\nart thou for the friend: for sustenance, for rain, for the lordship of\ncreatures--thee!' this is to say, 'This is thy kingdom; thou art consecrated\n(anointed)! thou art thy friend's supporter and sustainer: for our sustenance\nart thou, for rain unto us art thou, for our lordship of\n\np. 220\n\ncreatures art thou!' They thereby entreat him, 'For all this art thou unto us:\nfor all this have we consecrated thee!' And therefore people thus entreat a\nhuman king who has been consecrated.\n\n9:3:3:1212\\. He then offers the Prospering 1 (libations);--the prospering\n(libations) are the vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus puts into\nhim.--'May the vital strength prosper by sacrifice! may the vital air prosper\nby sacrifice! . . .' He thus puts proper vital airs into him.\n\n9:3:3:1313\\. Twelve prospering (libations) he offers,--a year consists of\ntwelve months, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his\nmeasure, by so much he thus puts proper vital airs into him. And as to why he\noffers the prospering (libations),--the prospering (libations) are vital airs,\nand the vital airs are the immortal element: with the immortal element he thus\nconsecrates him.\n\n9:3:3:1414\\. He then says, 'The Stoma, and the Ya _g_ us, and the _Ri_ k, and\nthe Saman, and the B _ri_ hat, and the Rathantara,'--this, doubtless, is the\ntriple science, and the triple science is food: it is with food he thus\ngratifies him, and with food he thus consecrates him;--'to the heavenly light\nwe gods have gone, we have become immortal,'--for he indeed goes to the\nheavenly light, and becomes immortal;--'Pra _g_ apati's children have we\nbecome!'--for he indeed becomes Pra _g_ apati's child,--'ve _t_! svaha!'--the\nVe _t_ -call, doubtless, is\n\np. 221\n\nesoterically the same as the Vasha _t_ -call, and either with the Vasha _t_\n-call, or the Svaha-call is food offered to the gods: he thus gratifies him by\nboth the Vasha _t_ and the Svaha, and also consecrates him by both of them. He\nnow throws the offering-ladle after (the ghee into the fire) lest what there\nis anointed with ghee should remain outside of the fire.\n\n9:3:3:1515\\. Now as to this same shower of wealth, the body (from which it\nflows) is the sky, the udder the cloud, the teat the lightning, and the shower\n(of ghee) is the (rain-) shower: from the sky it comes to the cow.\n\n9:3:3:1616\\. Its body is the cow, its udder the (cow's) udder, its teat the\n(cow's) teat, its shower the shower (of milk): from the cow (it comes) to the\nSacrificer.\n\n9:3:3:1717\\. Its body is the Sacrificer, its udder his arm, its teat the\noffering-ladle, its shower (of milk) the shower of (ghee): from the Sacrificer\n(it goes) to the gods; from the gods to the cow, from the cow to the\nSacrificer: thus circulates this perpetual, never-ending food of the gods.\nAnd, verily, for whosoever knows this, there will thus be perpetual, never-\nending food. Now as to the (mystic) correspondence.\n\n9:3:3:1818\\. As to this they say, 'How does this wealth-shower of his obtain\n(conformity with) the year, and Agni? how does it correspond to the year, to\nAgni?' Well, this shower of wealth consists of three hundred and sixty\n(libations), and of (other) six, and of thirty-five. Now, the three hundred\nand sixty which there are,--so many being the days in the year,--thereby it\nobtains the days of the year. And what six there are,--the seasons being\n\np. 222\n\nsix in number,--thereby it obtains the nights of the seasons: thus it obtains\nboth the days and nights of the year. And what thirty-five there are, they are\nthe (intercalary) thirteenth month 1, and that is the body,--the body\n(consists) of thirty (limbs), the feet of two, the breath of two (in-breathing\nand up-breathing), and the head is the thirty-fifth: so much is the year; and\nthus that shower of wealth of his obtains (conformity with) the year, and\nAgni; and thus it corresponds to the year, to Agni. And so many are the bricks\nwith special formulas which are placed in the centre of a _S_ a _n_ _d_ ila\nfire-altar; for these bricks indeed are the same as these different Agnis 2;\nand thus these Agnis of his come to have oblations offered to them separately\nby means of the shower of wealth.\n\n9:3:3:1919\\. As to this they say, 'How does this shower of wealth of his\nattain to (conformity with) the Great Litany, how does it correspond to the\nGreat Litany?' Well, the first nine formulas of this shower of wealth are the\nthreefold 3 head; and the forty-eight which follow are the twenty-four-fold\nwings 4; and the twenty-five which follow are the twenty-five-fold body 5; and\nthe twenty-one which follow are the tail, as the twenty-first 6; and the\n\np. 223\n\nthirty-five which follow are the Va _s_ a (hymn); and by the eighties (of\nverses) which follow those eighties (Of the mahad uktham) are obtained, for by\neighties the Great Litany is counted; and what there is after the eighties,\nthat to him (corresponds to) what, in the Great Litany, there is after the\neighties 1; and thus this shower of wealth of his attains to (conformity with)\nthe Great Litany, and corresponds to the Great Litany.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[217:1](sbe4337.htm#fr_372) These are two sets of libations in the formulas of\nwhich (XVIII, 22; 23) objects connected with 'special sacrifices' are\nenumerated. Thus, of the first pair, 'Agni and Gharma,' 'Agni,' according to\nMahidhara, represents either the Agni _k_ ayana or the Agnish _t_ oma\n(ordinary Soma-sacrifice); whilst the 'Gharma (cauldron)' stands for the\nPravargya offering (part i, p. 44 note).\n\n[217:2](sbe4337.htm#fr_373) The formula of this set of libations (XVIII, 24)\nenumerates the seventeen uneven numbers (in the feminine gender) from 1 to 33,\nrepeating the second number of each pair, so as to be the first number of the\nnext pair (thus, 1 and 3, 3 and 5, &c.). These numbers are meant to represent\nthe corresponding Stomas, consisting of an uneven number of verses, up to the\nTrayastri _m_ _s_ a, or thirty-three-versed hymn-form.\n\n[218:1](sbe4337.htm#fr_374) The formula of this set of libations (XVIII, 25)\nenumerates (the twelve quadruples of 4 (in the feminine gender), from 4 to 48\nagain repeating each number, except the first and last), as representing the\nStomas consisting of an even number of verses, up to the Ash _t_ a _k_ atvari\n_m_ _s_ a, or forty-eight-versed hymn-form.\n\n[218:2](sbe4337.htm#fr_375) The two formulas relating to these two sets of\nlibations (XVIII, 26; 27) contain respectively five and four pairs of teams of\ncattle of different ages, beginning with 'tryavi and tryavi,' 'an eighteen-\nmonths bull and an eighteen-months cow;' and ending with 'a bullock and a\nmilch cow.'\n\n[219:1](sbe4337.htm#fr_376) This set of thirteen libations (XVIII, 28) is\noffered to the months Va _g_ a, Prasava, &c., here apparently considered as\nmanifestations of Agni (the year). Each name is followed by 'svaha (hail!);'\nand the last of these dedicatory formulas is followed by the special\nbenedictory formula, referred to in [paragraph 10](sbe4337.htm#9:3:3:10).\n\n[220:1](sbe4337.htm#fr_377) This final set of twelve (? sixteen) libations is\ncalled thus (kalpa), because, in the formulas used with them (Va _g_. S.\nXVIII, 29), the verb 'k _li_ p (to prosper, to be right and proper)' is\nrepeated each time. At the conclusion of these twelve formulas the priest\nmutters the final benediction given in full in [paragraph\n14](sbe4337.htm#9:3:3:14).\n\n[222:1](sbe4337.htm#fr_378) See [p. 167](sbe4330.htm#page_167), note\n[1](sbe4330.htm#fn_283).\n\n[222:2](sbe4337.htm#fr_379) Viz. the different forms, or powers, of Agni, to\nwhich the 401 libations are offered. See [IX, 1, 1, 43](sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:43),\nwhere the very same calculations are applied to the _S_ atarudriya.\n\n[222:3](sbe4337.htm#fr_380) See [p. 114](sbe4324.htm#page_114), note\n[1](sbe4324.htm#fn_207).\n\n[222:4](sbe4337.htm#fr_381) Paksha, wing, also means half-month, fortnight, of\nwhich there are twenty-four in the year.\n\n[222:5](sbe4337.htm#fr_382) See [p. 168](sbe4330.htm#page_168), note\n[3](sbe4330.htm#fn_287).\n\n[222:6](sbe4337.htm#fr_383) Apparently in addition to the fingers and toes (?\nof monkeys).\n\n[223:1](sbe4337.htm#fr_384) See pp. [110](sbe4324.htm#page_110), note\n[3](sbe4324.htm#fn_202); [112](sbe4324.htm#page_112), n.\n[1](sbe4324.htm#fn_204); [113](sbe4324.htm#page_113), n.\n[1](sbe4324.htm#fn_206).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 3, 4.
