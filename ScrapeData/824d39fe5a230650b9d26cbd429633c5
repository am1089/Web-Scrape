Sitting with the feet stretched out and crossed so as to touch the thighs,\nwith the right hand (stretched out and) resting upon the left, with the tongue\nfixed in the palate, and without bringing the one row of teeth in contact with\nthe other, with the eyes directed to the tip of the nose, and without glancing\nat any of the (four) quarters of the sky, free from fear, and with composure,\nlet him meditate upon (Purusha), who is separate from the twenty-four\nentities,\n\n[XCVII. 1. Y. III, 198-200.--9. Y. III, 111, 201. This chapter treats of the\nmeans for obtaining that knowledge of the \xc3\x82tman or Self, which has been\ndeclared at the end of the last chapter to be the road to final emancipation.\n(Nand.)\n\n1\\. \'The twenty-four (it should be twenty-five) entities are stated in the _S_\na _n_ khya to consist of the root-principle (mulaprak _ri_ ti), the seven\nproductions evolved from it (vik _ri_ taya _h_ ), the sixteen productions\nevolved from these, and Purusha (the soul), who is neither producer nor\nproduced. (1) The "root-principle" is composed of the three qualities in\nequipoise: sattva, ragas, and tamas (the most accurate rendering of these\nterms is perhaps that proposed by Elliot, "pure unimpassioned virtue,"\n"passion," and "depravity inclining to evil." See Fitz-Edward Hall, Preface to\n_S_ a _n_ khyaprava _k_ anabhashya, p. 44 (2) The "great entity" (Mahat) is\nthe cause of apprehension. (3) The "self-consciousness" (aha _m_ kara) is the\ncause of {p.188} referring all objects to self. (4-2) The "subtile elementary\nparticles" (tanmatras) are identical with sound, tangibility, form, taste, and\nodour. (9-19) The eleven senses (i. e. the organs of perception and action\nenumerated in CXVI, 94, 95, and manas, "the mind"), and (20-24) the five\n"grosser elements" (ether, air, fire, water, and earth) are productions (from\nthe former entities). Purusha, who is neither producer nor produced, is the\ntwenty-fifth entity.\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 288\n\n2\\. He who is eternal, beyond the cognisance of the senses, destitute of\nqualities, not concerned with sound, tangibility, form, savour, or odour,\nknowing everything, of immense size,\n\n3\\. He who pervades everything, and who is devoid of form,\n\n4\\. Whose hands and feet are everywhere, whose eyes, head, and face are\neverywhere, and who is able to apprehend everything with all the senses.\n\n5\\. Thus let him meditate.\n\n6\\. If he remains absorbed in such meditation for a year, he obtains the\naccomplishment of Yoga (concentration of the thought and union with the\nSupreme).\n\n7\\. If he is unable to fix his mind upon the being\n\n[2, 3. According to Nand., all the properties of Purusha mentioned in this\nSutra are such as distinguish him from the rest of the entities, the first two\ndistinguishing him from \'self-consciousness\' (aha _m_ kara), the voidness of\nquality distinguishing him from the \'root-principle\' (mulaprak _ri_ ti), which\nis composed of three qualities, &c.\n\n4\\. The properties of Purusha here mentioned are faculties only, so that there\nis no contradiction to the \'voidness of form\' and the other properties\nenumerated in the preceding Sutras. (Nand.)\n\n6\\. The external signs of the accomplishment of Yoga, as stated by Ya _g_\n\xc3\xb1avalkya (III, 202 seq.), are, the faculty of entering another body and of\ncreating anything at will, and other miraculous powers and qualities. (Nand.)]\n\np. 289\n\ndestitute of form[1], he must meditate successively on earth, water, fire,\nair, ether, mind, intellect, self[2], the indiscrete[3], and Purusha[4]:\nhaving fully apprehended one, he must dismiss it from his thoughts and fix his\nmind upon the next one in order.\n\n8\\. In this way let him arrive at meditation upon Purusha.\n\n9\\. If unable to follow this method also, he must meditate on Purusha shining\nlike a lamp in his heart, as in a lotus turned upside down.\n\n10\\. If he cannot do that either, he must meditate upon Bhagavat Vasudeva\n(Vish _n_ u), who is adorned with a diadem, with ear-rings, and with\nbracelets, who has the (mystic mark) _S_ rivatsa and a garland of wood-flowers\non his breast, whose aspect is pleasing, who has four arms, who holds the\nshell, the discus, the mace, and the lotus-flower, and whose feet are\nsupported (and worshipped) by the earth.\n\n11\\. Whatever he meditates upon, that is obtained by a man (in a future\nexistence): such is the mysterious power of meditation.\n\n12\\. Therefore must he dismiss everything perishable\n\n[7. 1 The term nirakara, \'the being destitute of form,\' evidently refers to\nPurusha here (cf. Sutra 3), though Nand. interprets it as an epithet of\n\'Brahman.\'--2 Intellect\' (buddhi) and \'self\' (atman), according to Nand., mean\n\'the great entity\' (mahat) and \'self-consciousness\' (aha _m_ kara), cf. note\non Sutra 1.--3 \'The indiscrete\' (avyaktam) means \'the chief one\' (pradhanam),\ni. c. the _S_ a _n_ khya \'root-principle\' (see XCVI, 96).--4 Nand. takes\nPurusha, in this Sutra and in 13, 15 to mean \'the twenty-sixth entity;\' but it\nappears clearly from Sutra 1, as from 16 also, that the Vish _n_ u-sutra, like\nthe _S_ a _n_ khya system, assumes twenty-five entities only, not twenty-six,\nlike Yama, upon whose authority Nand.\'s statement is based.\n\n9\\. 1 Nand. interprets the term Purusha here by atman. \'self.\']\n\np. 290\n\nfrom his thoughts and meditate upon what is imperishable only.\n\n13\\. There is nothing imperishable except Purusha.\n\n14\\. Having become united with him (through constant meditation), he obtains\nfinal liberation.\n\n15\\. Because the great lord pervades the whole universe (pura), as he is lying\nthere ( _s_ ete), therefore is he denominated Puru-sha by those who reflect\nupon the real nature (of the Supreme Spirit).\n\n16\\. In the first part and the latter part of the night must a man bent on\ncontemplation constantly and with fixed attention meditate upon Purusha Vish\n_n_ u, who is destitute of (the three) qualities (sattva, ra _g_ as, and\ntamas[1]) and the twenty-fifth entity.\n\n17\\. He (or it) is composed of the entities, beyond the cognisance of the\nsenses, distinct from all the (other) entities, free from attachment (to the\nproducer, &c.), supporting everything, devoid of qualities and yet enjoying\n(or witnessing the effect of) qualities.\n\n18\\. It exists without and within created beings (as being enjoyed and as\nenjoyer), and in the shape both of immovable things (such as trees or stones)\nand of movable things (such as water or fire); it is undistinguishable on\naccount of its subtlety; it is out of reach (imperceptible), and yet is found\nin the heart.\n\n[16. 1 See Sutra 1, note.\n\n17\\. Thus according to the reading asaktam, which is mentioned and explained\nas a var. lect. by Nand. He himself reads a _s_ aktam, \'independent of _S_\nakti, power, i. e. the producer, the power of creation (prak _ri_ ti), or\nillusion (maya).\' Maya and prakriti are occasionally used as synonymous terms\nin the Sa _n_ khya.]\n\np. 291\n\n19\\. It is not distinct from creation, and yet distinct from it in outward\nappearance; it annihilates and produces by turns (the world), which consists\nof everything that has been, that will be, and that is.\n\n20\\. It is termed the light of the sidereal bodies and the enemy of darkness\n(ignorance), it is knowledge, it should be known, it may be understood (by\nmeditation), it dwells in every man\'s heart.\n\n21\\. Thus the \'field,\' knowledge (or meditation), and what should be known[1]\nhave been concisely declared; that faithful adherent of mine who makes himself\nacquainted therewith, becomes united to me in spirit.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XCVIII.](sbe07100.htm)\n\n'
