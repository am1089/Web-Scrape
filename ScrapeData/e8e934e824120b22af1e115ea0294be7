Benevolent Agni has looked on the breaking of the shining dawns, on the\nbestowal of treasures. Come to the dwelling of the virtuous (mortal), ye A _s_\nvins. The god Surya rises with his light.\n\n2\\. The god Savit _ri_ has sent his light upward\n[1](sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:2:1), shaking his banner\n[2](sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:2:2) like a warrior who fights for cows\n[3](sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:2:3). Varu _n_ a and Mitra follow the law, when they\nmake the Sun rise on heaven.\n\n3\\. Him whom (the gods) dwelling in firm peace, and never losing their object,\nhave created for dispersing the darkness--Him, the Sun, the all-observer, the\nseven young fallow mares carry forward.\n\n4\\. With (thy horses) most ready to run thou goest\n[1](sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:4:1) forward, spreading out thy web (of light),\nremoving (from the world) the black cloth (of darkness), O god. The rays of\nthe Sun have shaken [2](sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:4:2) the darkness, and have sunk\nit into the waters like a hide.\n\n5\\. Unsupported, unattached, spread out downwards-turned--how is it that he\n[1](sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:5:1) does not fall down? By what power of his does he\nmove? Who has seen (that)? Erected as the pillar of Heaven he protects the\nfirmament.\n\np. 357\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 4 = TB. II, 4, 5, 4.\n\nThis hymn and the next evidently form a couple. They have the same number of\nverses, and are composed in the same metre. They are both addressed to Agni in\nhis matutinal character, or rather to the A _s_ vins, who are invoked to\npartake of the matutinal oblation (13, 1; 14, 1. 4). The first verse of 13 is\nquite similar to that of 14; the same may be said of the second verses of the\ntwo hymns; the concluding verse of both is identical.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Cf. above, IV, 6, 2.\n\nNote 2. Cf. Zend drafsha, 'banner.'\n\nNote 3. Cf. IV, 40, 2. satva bharisha _h_ gavisha _h_.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The Sun is addressed.\n\nNote 2. It is more natural to take davidhvata _h_ as nom. plur. than as gen.\nsing. (Ludwig).\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. The Sun.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 14](sbe46103.htm)\n\n"
