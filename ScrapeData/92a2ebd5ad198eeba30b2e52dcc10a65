It is not expressly stated in our text for\nwhat occasion the tarpa _n_ a (i.e. satiating of deities, _Ri_ shis, &c. with\nwater-offerings), which is treated of in chap. 9-10, shall be prescribed. The\ncomparison of Baudhayana II, 9 might perhaps lead us to believe that the\nceremony in question is to be performed whenever the sacrificer takes a bath.\nBut the two texts which are most closely connected with ours, the _S_ ambavya\nand \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana G _ri_ hyas, seem to point clearly to another conclusion.\nThe _S_ ambavya-sutra transposes the rules about the tarpa _n_ a to the place\nwhich would correspond to Sutra II, 7, 28 of our text. The passage of the _S_\nambavya-sutra runs thus: mule ku _n_ _d_ a _m_ k _ri_ tva yathoktam adbhi _h_\nparishi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ aty athemas (so the MS.) tarpayati Agni _h_ Pra _g_ apatir\nVirupaksha _h_ , &c. It ends: pitara _h_ pitamaha _h_ prapitamaha _h_ Paila\n_h_ Kaho _l_ a _h_ Kaushitaka _h_ (sic) Kaho _l_ aya Kaushitakaye svadhastv\niti pratipurusha _h_ (sic) pit _r i_ _m_ s tarpayitva. The last words are\ntaken from the Sutra IV, 6, 6 of our text. Thus there can be no doubt that _S_\nambavya intended to prescribe the tarpa _n_ a for the conclusion of the p. 121\nvedadhyayana. The same can be said of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, who also by the position\nwhich he assigns to the tarpa _n_ a sections (III, 4) brings it into a similar\nconnection with the vedadhyayana (see Naraya _n_ a's commentary on \xc3\x82 _s_ v.,\nloc. cit.). We may also refer to the treatise about the study of the \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka, which is appended to the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya as its sixth book;\nthere the tarpa _n_ a is mentioned quite in the same connection (VI, 6, 10\nseq.). I believe, therefore, that in our text, chapters 9 and 10 have found\ntheir place here as a sort of supplementary addition to chap. 6, 6, just as in\nthe first book the list of Nakshatras seems likewise appended to the Sutra I,\n25, 5.\n\nAccording to Naraya _n_ a, snata _h_ in the first Sutra would refer to the\nbath which forms part of the Samavartana ceremony (see III, 1, 1), so that it\nwould be the G _ri_ hastha, who has taken the Samavartana bath, to whom the\nfollowing rules refer.\n\n[121:3](sbe29071.htm#fr_276) Comp. the similar lists of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, G _ri_\nhya III, 4; _S_ ambavya, quoted in my German edition of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, p.153;\nand Baudhayana II, 9 (S.B.E., vol. xiv, pp. 252 seq.). The last seems to be\nthe most modern.\n\nIt should be observed that the section of the list contained in this Sutra, as\nwell as that given below, chap. 10, 3, is divided into p. 122 two parts, in\nthe first of which the name of the being to be worshipped is given in the\nnominative case, with the verb tripyatu, while in the second it stands in the\naccusative, with the verb tarpayami. The first part of this section contains\nthe names of gods and of divine beings, such as the rivers, the mountains,\n&c.; in the second part are found abstract qualities or notions, such as mati,\ndhriti, _s_ ruti. Similarly in chapter 10, 3 the Vedic poets, a few ancient\nteachers, and wise women, such as Garg or Sulabha, form the first part of the\nlist, and then follow, in the accusative case, the names of such doctors as\nSaukhayana, \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, Sakalya. In \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana's Sutra of the first of\nour two sections only the first part reoccurs, the second is omitted, while\nthe second section is found there in its entirety, with the same difference of\nnames given in the nominative and accusative cases. The conjectures, however,\nwhich I had once based on this difference (see my German edition, pp. 152,\n153) as to the distinction of a more ancient part of the list, and of later\nsupplements, are perhaps too hazardous.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 10](sbe29072.htm)\n\n"
