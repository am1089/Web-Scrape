The Brahma-vaivartta Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n10\\. Brahma-vaivartta Puran\xcc\x81a. "That Puran\xcc\x81a which is related by Savarn\xcc\x81i to\nNarada, and contains the account of the greatness of Krishn\xcc\x81a, with the\noccurrences of the Rathantara Kalpa, where also the story of Brahma-varaha is\nrepeatedly told, is called the Brahma-vaivartta, and contains eighteen\nthousand stanzas 64." The account here given of the Brahma-vaivartta Puran\xcc\x81a\nagrees with its present state as to its extent. The copies rather exceed than\nfall short of eighteen thousand stanzas. It also correctly represents its\ncomprising a Mahatmya or legend of Krishn\xcc\x81a; but it is very doubtful,\nnevertheless, if the same work is intended.\n\nThe Brahma-vaivartta, as it now exists, is narrated, not by Savarn\xcc\x81i, but the\nRishi Narayan\xcc\x81a to Narada, by whom it is communicated to Vyasa: he teaches it\nto Suta, and the latter repeats it to the Rishis at Naimisharan\xcc\x81ya. It is\ndivided into four Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as, or books; the Brahma, Prakriti, Gane\xc5\x9ba, and\nKrishn\xcc\x81a Janma Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as; dedicated severally to describe the acts of Brahma,\nDevi, Gane\xc5\x9ba, and Krishn\xcc\x81a; the latter, however, throughout absorbing the\ninterest and importance of the work. In none of these is there any account of\nthe Varaha Avatara of Vishn\xcc\x81u, which seems to be intended by the Matsya; nor\nany reference to a Rathantara Kalpa. It may also be observed, that, in\ndescribing the merit of presenting a copy of this Puran\xcc\x81a, the Matsya adds,\n"Whoever makes such gift, is honoured in the Brahma-loka;" a sphere which is\nof very inferior dignity to that to which a worshipper of Krishn\xcc\x81a is taught\nto aspire by this Puran\xcc\x81a. The character of the work is in truth so decidedly\nsectarial, and the sect to which it belongs so distinctly marked,\n\np. xlii\n\nthat of the worshippers of the juvenile Krishn\xcc\x81a and Radha, a form of belief\nof known modern origin, that it can scarcely have found a notice in a work to\nwhich, like the Matsya, a much more remote date seems to belong. Although\ntherefore the Matsya may be received in proof of there having been a Brahma-\nvaivartta Puran\xcc\x81a at the date of its compilation, dedicated especially to the\nhonour of Krishn\xcc\x81a, yet we cannot credit the possibility of its being the same\nwe now possess.\n\nAlthough some of the legends believed to be ancient are scattered through the\ndifferent portions of this Puran\xcc\x81a, yet the great mass of it is taken up with\ntiresome descriptions of Vrindavan and Goloka, the dwellings of Krishn\xcc\x81a on\nearth and in heaven; with endless repetitions of prayers and invocations\naddressed to him; and with insipid descriptions of his person and sports, and\nthe love of the Gopis and of Radha towards him. There are some particulars of\nthe origin of the artificer castes, which is of value because it is cited as\nauthority in matters affecting them, contained in the Brahma Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a; and in\nthe Prakrita and Gane\xc5\x9ba Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as are legends of those divinities, not wholly,\nperhaps, modern inventions, but of which the source has not been traced. In\nthe life of Krishn\xcc\x81a the incidents recorded are the same as those narrated in\nthe Vishn\xcc\x81u and the Bhagavata; but the stories, absurd as they are, are much\ncompressed to make room for original matter, still more puerile and tiresome.\nThe Brahma-vaivartta has not the slightest title to be regarded as a Puran\xcc\x81a\n65.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xli:64](vp014.htm#fr_63) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_04100.jpg)\n\n[xlii:65](vp014.htm#fr_64) Analysis of the Brahma-vaivartta Puran\xcc\x81a: Journal\nof the Asiatic Society of Bengal, June 1832.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 11.
