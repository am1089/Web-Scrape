Naraya _n_ a said :-- Then, initiating her with the Great Seed, the \xc3\x82di\nRadical Mantra of the Maha S\xc2\x92akti, S\xc2\x92ri Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari in accordance with due\nrules, the son of Surya began to recite the various effects of various Karmas,\nauspicious and inauspicious. Never do the persons go to hell when they perform\ngood Karmas; it is only the bad works that lead men to hells. The different\nPura _n_ as narrate various heavens. The Jivas go to those places as the\neffects of their various good Karmas. The good Karmas do not lead men to\nhells; but the bad Karmas do lead them veritably to various hideous hells. In\ndifferent S\xc2\x92astras, different hell-pits are ascertained. Different works lead\nmen to different hells. O Child! Those hell-pits are very wide, deep, painful\nand tormenting, very horrible and ugly. Of these, eighty six pits or Ku _nd_\nas are prominent. Many other Ku _nd_ as exist. Now listen to the names of the\nKu _nd_ as mentioned in the Vedas. Their names are :-- Vah _n_ i Ku _nd_ a,\nTapta Ku _nd_ a, K _s_ ara Ku _nd_ a, Bhayanaka Ku _nd_ a, Vi _t_ Ku _nd_ a,\nMutra Ku _nd_ a, S\xc2\x92le _s_ ma Ku _nd_ a, Gara Ku _nd_ a, Du _s_ ika Ku _nd_ a,\nVasa Ku _nd_ a, S\xc2\x92ukra Ku _nd_ a, S\xc2\x92o _n_ ita Ku _nd_ a, As\xc2\x92ru Ku _nd_ a,\nGatramala Ku _nd_ a, Kar _n_ amala Ku _nd_ a, Majja Ku _nd_ a, Mamsa Ku _nd_\na, impassable Nakra Ku _nd_ a, Loma Ku _nd_ a, Kes\xc2\x92a Ku _nd_ a, impassable\nAsthi Ku _nd_ a, Tamra Ku _nd_ a, the exceedingly hot and painful Lauha Ku\n_nd_ a (the pit of molten iron), Charma Ku _nd_ a, the hot Sura Ku _nd_ a,\nsharp Thorny Ku _nd_ a, Vi _s_ a Ku _nd_ a, the hot Taila Ku _nd_ a, very\nheavy Astra Ku _nd_ a, Krimi Ku _nd_ a, Puya Ku _nd_ a, terrible Sarpa\n\n\n\np. 927\n\n\n\nKu _nd_ a, Mas\xc2\x92aka Ku _nd_ a, Dams\xc2\x92a Ku _nd_ a, dreadful Garala Ku _nd_ a,\nVajra Dam _st_ ra Vris\xc2\x92chika Ku _nd_ a, S\xc2\x92ara Ku _nd_ a, Sula Ku _nd_ a, awful\nKha _d_ ga Ku _nd_ a, Gola Ku _nd_ a, Nakra Ku _nd_ a, sorrowful Kaka Ku _nd_\na, Manthana Ku _nd_ a, Vija Ku _nd_ a, painful Vajra Ku _nd_ a, hot Pats\xc2\x92a _n_\na Ku _nd_ a, sharp Pas\xc2\x92a _n_ a Ku _nd_ a, Lala Ku _nd_ a, Masi Ku _nd_ a,\nChakra Ku _nd_ a, Vakra Ku _nd_ a, very terrible Kurma Ku _nd_ a, Jvala Ku\n_nd_ a, Bhasma Ku _nd_ a, Dagdha Ku _nd_ a, and others. Besides these, there\nare the Taptasuchi, Asipatra, K _s_ uradhara, Suchimukha, Gokhamukha,\nKumbhipaka, Kalasutra, Matsyoda, Krimi, Kantuka, Pams\xc2\x92ubhojya, Pas\xc2\x92ave _st_ a,\nSulaprota, Prakampana, Ulkamakha, Andhakupa, Vedhana, Ta _d_ ana, Jalarandhra,\nDehachurna, Dalana, S\xc2\x92o _s_ a _n_ a, Ka _s_ a, S\xc2\x92urpa, Jvalamukha, Dhumandha,\nNagave _st_ ana and various others. O Savitri! The Ku _nd_ as give much pain\nand torment greatly the sinners; they are under the constant watch of\ninnumerable servants. They hold rods in their hands; some of them have nooses;\nothers hold clubs, S\xc2\x92aktis, awful scimitars; they are fierce fanatics,\nmaddened with vanity. All are filled with Tamogu _n_ as, merciless,\nirresistible, energetic, fearless and tawny-eyed (like copper). Some of them\nare Yogis; some are Siddhas, they assume various forms. When the sinners are\nabout to die, they see these servants of Yama. But those who do their own\nduties, who are S\xc2\x92aktas, Sauras, or Ga _n_ apatyas or those who are virtuous\nSiddha Yogis, they never see the servants of Yama. Those who are engaged in\ntheir own Dharmas, who are possessed of wisdom, who are endowed with\nknowledge, who are mentally strong, who are untouched by fear, who are endowed\nwith the feelings of the Devas, and those who are real Vai _sn_ avas, they\nnever see these servants of Yama. O Chaste One! Thus I have enumerated to you\nthe Ku _nd_ as. Now hear who live in the Ku _nd_ as.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty-second Chapter of the Ninth Book on the enumeration of\nvarious hells for sinners in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 33](bk09ch33.htm)\n\n'
