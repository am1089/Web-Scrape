XI.\n\nLegend of Dhruva, the son of Uttanapada: he is unkindly treated by his\nfather\'s second wife: applies to his mother: her advice: he resolves to engage\nin religious exercises: sees the seven Rishis, who recommend him to propitiate\nVishn\xcc\x81u.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA continued.--I mentioned to you, that the Manu Swayambhuva had two\nheroic and pious sons, Priyavrata and Uttanapada. Of these two, the latter had\na son whom he dearly loved, Uttama, by his favourite wife Suruchi. By his\nqueen, named Suniti, to whom he was less attached, he also had a son, called\nDhruva 1. Observing his brother Uttama on the lap of his father, as he was\nseated upon his throne, Dhruva was desirous of ascending to the same place;\nbut as Suruchi was present, the Raja did not gratify the desire of his son,\nrespectfully wishing to be taken on his father\'s knee. Beholding the child of\nher rival thus anxious to be placed on his father\'s lap, and her own son\nalready seated there, Suruchi thus addressed the boy: "Why, child, do you\nvainly indulge in such presumptuous hopes? You are born from a different\nmother, and are no son of mine, that you should aspire inconsiderately to a\nstation fit for the excellent Uttama alone. It is true you are the son of the\nRaja, but I have not given you birth. This regal throne, the seat of the king\nof kings, is suited to my son only; why should you aspire to its occupation?\nwhy idly cherish such lofty ambition, as if you were my son? do you forget\nthat you are but the offspring of Suniti."\n\nThe boy, having heard the speech of his step-mother, quitted his father, and\nrepaired in a passion to the apartment of his own mother; who, beholding him\nvexed, took him upon her lap, and, gently smiling, asked him what was the\ncause of his anger, who had displeased him, and if any one, forgetting the\nrespect due to his father, had behaved ill to\n\np. 87\n\nhim. Dhruva, in reply, repeated to her all that the arrogant Suruchi had said\nto him in the presence of the king. Deeply distressed by the narrative of the\nboy, the humble Suniti, her eyes dimmed with tears, sighed, and said, "Suruchi\nhas rightly spoken; thine, child, is an unhappy fate: those who are born to\nfortune are not liable to the insults of their rivals. Yet be not afflicted,\nmy child, for who shall efface what thou hast formerly done, or shall assign\nto thee what thou hast left undone. The regal throne, the umbrella of royalty,\nhorses and elephants, are his whose virtues have deserved them: remember this,\nmy son, and be consoled. That the king favours Suruchi is the reward of her\nmerits in a former existence. The name of wife alone belongs to such as I, who\nhave not equal merit. Her son is the progeny of accumulated piety, and is born\nas Uttama: mine has been born as Dhruva, of inferior moral worth. Therefore,\nmy son, it is not proper for you to grieve; a wise man will be contented with\nthat degree which appertains to him: but if you continue to feel hurt at the\nwords of Suruchi, endeavour to augment that religious merit which bestows all\ngood; be amiable, be pious, be friendly, be assiduous in benevolence to all\nliving creatures; for prosperity descends upon modest worth as water flows\ntowards low ground."\n\nDhruva answered; "Mother, the words that you have addressed to me for my\nconsolation find no place in a heart that contumely has broken. I will exert\nmyself to obtain such elevated rank, that it shall be revered by the whole\nworld. Though I be not born of Suruchi, the beloved of the king, you shall\nbehold my glory, who am your son. Let Uttama my brother, her child, possess\nthe throne given to him by my father; I wish for no other honours than such as\nmy own actions shall acquire, such as even my father has not enjoyed."\n\nHaving thus spoken, Dhruva went forth from his mother\'s dwelling: he quitted\nthe city, and entered an adjoining thicket, where he beheld seven Munis\nsitting upon hides of the black antelope, which they had taken from off their\npersons, and spread over the holy kusa grass. Saluting them reverentially, and\nbowing humbly before then, the prince said, "Behold in me, venerable men, the\nson of Uttanapada, born of\n\np. 88\n\n[paragraph continues] Suniti. Dissatisfied with the world, I appear before\nyou." The Rishis replied; "The son of a king, and but four or five years of\nage, there can be no reason, child, why you should be dissatisfied with life;\nyou cannot be in want of any thing whilst the king your father reigns; we\ncannot imagine that you suffer the pain of separation from the object of your\naffections; nor do we observe in your person any sign of disease. What is the\ncause of your discontent? Tell us, if it is known to yourself."\n\nDhruva then repeated to the Rishis what Suruchi had spoken to him; and when\nthey had heard his story, they said to one another, "How surprising is the\nvehemence of the Kshetriya nature, that resentment is cherished even by a\nchild, and he cannot efface from his mind the harsh speeches of a step-mother.\nSon of a Kshetriya, tell us, if it be agreeable to thee, what thou hast\nproposed, through dissatisfaction with the world, to accomplish. If thou\nwishest our aid in what thou hast to do, declare it freely, for we perceive\nthat thou art desirous to speak."\n\nDhruva said; "Excellent sages, I wish not for riches, neither do I want\ndominion: I aspire to such a station as no one before me has attained. Tell me\nwhat I must do to effect this object; how I may reach an elevation superior to\nall other dignities." The Rishis severally thus replied.--Marichi said; "The\nbest of stations is not within the reach of men who fail to propitiate\nGovinda. Do thou, prince, worship the undecaying (Achyuta)." Atri said; "He\nwith whom the first of spirits, Janarddana, is pleased, obtains imperishable\ndignity. I declare unto you the truth." Angiras said; "If you desire an\nexalted station, worship that Govinda in whom, immutable and undecaying, all\nthat is, exists." Pulastya said; "He who adores the divine Hari, the supreme\nsoul, supreme glory, who is the supreme Brahma, obtains what is difficult of\nattainment, eternal liberation." "When that Janarddana," observed Kratu, "who\nin sacrifices is the soul of sacrifice, and who in abstract contemplation is\nsupreme spirit, is pleased, there is nothing man may not acquire." Pulaha\nsaid; "Indra, having worshipped" the lord of the world, obtained the dignity\nof king of the celestials. Do thou adore, pious youth, that Vishn\xcc\x81u, the lord\nof sacrifice." "Any thing, child, that the mind covets," exclaimed Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha,\n"may be obtained by propitiating\n\np. 89\n\n[paragraph continues] Vishn\xcc\x81u, even though it he the station that is the most\nexcellent in the three worlds."\n\nDhruva replied to them; "You have told me, humbly bending before you, what\ndeity is to be propitiated: now inform me what prayer is to he meditated by\nme, that will offer him gratification. May the great Rishis, looking upon me\nwith favour, instruct me how I am to propitiate the god." The Rishis answered;\n"Prince, thou deservest to hear how the adoration of Vishn\xcc\x81u has been\nperformed by those who have been devoted to his service. The mind must first\nbe made to forsake all external impressions, and a man must then fix it\nsteadily on that being in whom the world is. By him whose thoughts are thus\nconcentrated on one only object, and wholly filled by it; whose spirit is\nfirmly under control; the prayer that we shall repeat to thee is to be\ninaudibly recited: \'Om! glory to Vasudeva, whose essence is divine wisdom;\nwhose form is inscrutable, or is manifest as Brahma, Vishn\xcc\x81u, and \xc5\x9aiva 2.\'\nThis prayer, which was formerly uttered by your grandsire, the Manu\nSwayambhuva, and propitiated by which, Vishn\xcc\x81u conferred upon him the\nprosperity he desired, and which was unequalled in the three worlds, is to be\nrecited by thee. Do thou constantly repeat this prayer, for the gratification\nof Govinda."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[86:1](vp046.htm#fr_252) The Matsya, Brahma, and Vayu Puran\xcc\x81as speak of but\none wife of Uttanapada, and call her Sunrita: they say also that she had four\nsons, Apaspati (or Vasu), Ayushmanta, Kirttimat, and Dhruva. The Bhagavata,\nPadma, and Naradiya have the same account as that of the text.\n\n[89:2](vp046.htm#fr_253) The instructions of the Rishis amount to the\nperformance of the Yoga. External impressions are first to be obviated by\nparticular positions, modes of breathing, &c.: the mind must then be fixed on\nthe object of meditation; this is Dharana: next comes the meditation, or\nDhyana; and then the Japa, or inaudible repetition of a Mantra, or short\nprayer; as in the text. The subject of the Yoga is more fully detailed in a\nsubsequent book.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XII](vp047.htm)\n\n'
