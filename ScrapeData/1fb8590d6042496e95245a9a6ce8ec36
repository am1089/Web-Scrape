Perhaps all of you\nhave observed it as a fact that when persons do evil actions they become more\nand more evil, and when they begin to do good they become stronger and\nstronger and learn to do good at all times. This intensification of the\ninfluence of action cannot be explained on any other ground, than that we can\nact and react upon each other. To take an illustration from physical science,\nwhen I am doing a certain action, my mind may be said to be in a certain state\nof vibration; all minds which are in similar circumstances will have the\ntendency to be affected by my mind. If there are different musical instruments\ntuned alike in one room, all of you may have noticed that when one is struck\nthe others have the tendency to vibrate so as to give the same note. So all\nminds that have the same tension, so to say, will be equally affected by the\nsame thought. Of course, this influence of thought on mind will vary,\naccording to distance and other causes, but the mind is always open to\naffection. Suppose I am doing an evil act, my mind is in a certain state of\nvibration, and all minds in the universe, which are in a similar state, have\nthe possibility of being affected by the vibration of my mind. So, when I am\ndoing a good action, my mind is in another state of vibration; and all minds\nsimilarly strung have the possibility of being affected by my mind; and this\npower of mind upon mind is more or less according as the force of the tension\nis greater or less.\n\nFollowing this simile further, it is quite possible that, just as light waves\nmay travel for millions of years before\n\np. 80\n\nthey reach any object, so thought waves may also travel hundreds of years\nbefore they meet an object with which they vibrate in unison. It is quite\npossible, therefore, that this atmosphere of ours is full of such thought\npulsations, both good and evil. Every thought projected from every brain goes\non pulsating, as it were, until it meets a fit object that will receive it.\nAny mind which is open to receive some of these impulses will take them\nimmediately. So, when a man is doing evil actions, he has brought his mind to\na certain state of tension and all the waves which correspond to that state of\ntension, and which may be said to be already in the atmosphere, will struggle\nto enter into his mind. That is why an evil-doer generally goes on doing more\nand more evil. His actions become intensified. Such, also, will be the case\nwith the doer of good; he will open himself to all the good waves that are in\nthe atmosphere, and his good actions also will become intensified. We run,\ntherefore, a twofold danger in doing evil: first, we open ourselves to all the\nevil influences surrounding us; secondly, we create evil which affects others,\nmay be, hundreds of years hence. In doing evil we injure ourselves and others\nalso. In doing good we do good to ourselves and to others as well; and, like\nall other forces in man, these forces of good and evil also gather strength\nfrom outside.\n\nAccording to _Karma-Yoga_ , the action one has done cannot be destroyed, until\nit has borne its fruit; no power in nature can stop it from yielding its\nresults. If I do an evil action, I must suffer for it; there is no power in\nthis universe to stop or stay it. Similarly if I do a good action, there is no\npower in the universe which can stop its bearing good results. The cause must\nhave its effect; nothing can prevent or restrain this. Now comes a very fine\nand serious question about _Karma-Yoga_ --namely, that these actions of ours,\nboth good and evil, are intimately connected with each other. We cannot put a\nline of\n\np. 81\n\ndemarcation and say, this action is entirely good and this entirely evil.\nThere is no action which does not bear good and evil fruits at the same time.\nTo take the nearest example: I am talking to you, and some of you, perhaps,\nthink I am doing good; and at the same time I am, perhaps, killing thousands\nof microbes in the atmosphere; I am thus doing evil to something else. When it\nis very near to us and affects those we know, we say that it is very good\naction, if it affects them in a good manner. For instance, you may call my\nspeaking to you very good, but the microbes will not; the microbes you do not\nsee, but yourselves you do see. The way in which my talk affects you is\nobvious to you, but how it affects the microbes is not so obvious. And so, if\nwe analyse our evil actions also we may find that some good possibly results\nfrom them somewhere. He who in good action sees that there is something evil\nin it, and in the midst of evil sees that there is something good in it\nsomewhere,--has known the secret of work.\n\nBut what follows from it? That, howsoever we may try, there cannot be any\naction which is perfectly pure, or any which is perfectly impure, taking\npurity and impurity in the sense of injury and non-injury. We cannot breathe\nor live without injuring others, and every bit of the food we eat is taken\naway from another\'s mouth: our very lives are crowding out other lives. It may\nbe men, or animals, or small microbes, but some one or other of these we have\nto crowd out. That being the case, it naturally follows that perfection can\nnever be attained by work. We may work through all eternity, but there will be\nno way out of this intricate maze; you may work on, and on, and on; there will\nbe no end to this inevitable association of good and evil in the results of\nwork.\n\nThe second point to consider is, what is the end of work? We find the vast\nmajority of people in every country believing that there will be a time when\nthis world\n\np. 82\n\nwill become perfect, when there will be no disease, or death, or unhappiness,\nor wickedness. That is a very good idea, a very good motive power to inspire\nand uplift the ignorant; but if we think for a moment we shall find on the\nvery face of it that it cannot be so. How can it be, seeing that good and evil\nare the obverse and reverse of the same coin? How can you have good without\nevil at the same time? What is meant by perfection? A perfect life is a\ncontradiction in terms. Life itself is a state of continuous struggle between\nourselves and everything outside. Every moment we are fighting actually with\nexternal nature, and if we are defeated our life has to go. It is, for\ninstance, a continuous struggle for food and air. If food or air fails we die.\nLife is not a simple and smoothly flowing thing, but it is a compound effect.\nThis complex struggle between something inside and the external world is what\nwe call life. So it is clear that when this struggle ceases, there will be an\nend of life.\n\nWhat is meant by ideal happiness is that,--when there is the cessation of this\nstruggle. But then life will cease, for the struggle can only cease when life\nitself has ceased. We have seen already that in helping the world we help\nourselves. The main effect of work done for others is to purify ourselves. By\nmeans of the constant effort to do good to others we are trying to forget\nourselves; this forgetfulness of self is the one great lesson we have to learn\nin life. Man thinks foolishly that he can make himself happy, and after years\nof struggle finds out at last that true happiness consists in killing\nselfishness and that no one can make him happy except himself. Every act of\ncharity, every thought of sympathy, every action of help, every good deed, is\ntaking so much of self-importance away from our little selves and making us\nthink of ourselves as the lowest and the least; and, therefore, it is all\ngood. Here we find that _Jnana_ , _Bhakti_ , and _Karma_ , all come to one\npoint. The highest ideal is\n\np. 83\n\neternal and entire self-abnegation, where there is no "I," but all is "thou";\nand whether he is conscious, or unconscious of it _Karma-Yoga_ leads man to\nthat end. A religious preacher may become horrified at the idea of an\nimpersonal God; he may insist on a personal God and wish to keep up his own\nidentity and individuality, whatever he may mean by that. But his ideas of\nethics, if they are really good, cannot but be based on the highest self-\nabnegation. It is the basis of all morality; you may extend it to men, or\nanimals, or angels, it is the one basic idea, the one fundamental principle\nrunning through all ethical systems.\n\nYou will find various classes of men in this world. First, there are the God-\nmen, whose self-abnegation is complete, and who do only good to others even at\nthe sacrifice of their own lives. These are the highest of men. If there are a\nhundred of such in any country, that country need never despair. But they are\nunfortunately too few. Then there are the good men who do good to others so\nlong as it does not injure themselves; and there is a third class, who, to do\ngood to themselves, injure others. It is said by a Sanskrit poet that there is\na fourth unnameable class of people who injure others merely for injury\'s\nsake. Just as there are at one pole of existence the highest good men, who do\ngood for the sake of doing good, so, at the other pole, there are others who\ninjure others just for the sake of the injury. They do not gain anything\nthereby, but it is their nature to do evil.\n\nHere are two Sanskrit words. The one is "Pravritti," which means revolving\ntowards, and the other is "Nivritti," which means revolving away. The\n"revolving towards" is what we call the world, the "I and mine"; it includes\nall those things which are always enriching that "me" by wealth and money and\npower, and name and fame, and which are of a grasping nature, always tending\nto accumulate everything in one centre, that centre being\n\np. 84\n\n[paragraph continues] "myself." That is the "Pravatti," the natural tendency\nof every human being; taking everything from everywhere and heaping it around\none centre, that centre being man\'s own sweet self. When this tendency begins\nto break, when it is "Nivritti" or "going away from," then begin morality and\nreligion. Both "Pravritti" and "Nivritti" are of the nature of work: the\nformer is evil work, and the latter is good work. This "Nivritti" is the\nfundamental basis of all morality and all religion, and the very perfection of\nit is entire self-abnegation, readiness to sacrifice mind and body and\neverything for another being. When a man has reached that state he has\nattained to the perfection of _Karma-Yoga_. This is the highest result of good\nworks. Although a man has not studied a single system of philosophy, although\nhe does not believe in any God, and never has believed, although he has not\nprayed even once in his whole life, if the simple power of good actions has\nbrought him to that state where he is ready to give up his life and all else\nfor others, he has arrived at the same point to which the religious man will\ncome through his prayers and the philosopher through his knowledge; and so you\nmay find that the philosopher, the worker, and the devotee, all meet at one\npoint, that one point being self-abnegation. However much their systems of\nphilosophy and religion may differ, all mankind stand in reverence and awe\nbefore the man who is ready to sacrifice himself for others. Here, it is not\nat all any question of creed, or doctrine--even men who are very much opposed\nto all religious ideas, when they see one of these acts of complete self-\nsacrifice, feel that they must revere it. Have you not seen even a most\nbigoted Christian, when he reads Edwin Arnold\'s "Light of Asia," stand in\nreverence of Buddha, who preached no God, preached nothing but self-sacrifice?\nThe only thing is that the bigot does not know that his own end and aim in\nlife is exactly the same as that of those from whom he differs. The\nworshipper,\n\np. 85\n\nby keeping constantly before him the idea of God and a surrounding of good,\ncomes to the same point at last and says, "Thy will be done," and keeps\nnothing to himself. That is self-abnegation. The philosopher, with his\nknowledge, sees that the seeming self is a delusion and easily gives it up; it\nis self-abnegation. So _Karma_ , _Bhakti_ and _Jnana_ all meet here; and this\nis what was meant by all the great preachers of ancient times, when they\ntaught that God is not the world. There is one thing which is the world and\nanother which is God; and this distinction is very true; what they mean by\nworld is selfishness. Unselfishness is God. One may live on a throne, in a\ngolden palace, and be perfectly unselfish; and then he is in God. Another may\nlive in a hut and wear rags, and have nothing in the world; yet, if he is\nselfish, he is intensely merged in the world.\n\nTo come back to one of our main points, we say that we cannot do good without\nat the same time doing some evil, or do evil without doing some good. Knowing\nthis, how can we work? There have therefore been sects in this world who have\nin an astoundingly [preposterous](errata.htm#3) way preached slow suicide as\nthe only means to get out of the world; because, if a man lives he has to kill\npoor little animals and plants or do injury to something or some one. So,\naccording to them the only way out of the world is to die. The Jainas have\npreached this doctrine as their highest ideal. This teaching seems to be very\nlogical. But the true solution is found in the _Gita_. It is the theory of\nnon-attachment, to be attached to nothing while doing our work of life. Know\nthat you are separated entirely from the world; that you are in the world, and\nthat whatever you may be doing in it, you are not doing that for your own\nsake. Any action that you do for yourself will bring its effect to bear upon\nyou. If it is a good action you will have to take the good effect, and, if\nbad, you will have to take the bad effect; but any action that is not\n\np. 86\n\ndone for your own sake, whatever it be, will have no effect on you. There is\nto be found a very expressive sentence in our scriptures embodying this\nidea:--"Even if he kill the whole universe (or be himself killed) he is\nneither the killer nor the killed, when he knows that he is not acting for\nhimself at all." Therefore Karma-Yoga teaches, "Do not give up the world; live\nin the world, imbibe its influences as much as you can; but if it be for your\nown enjoyment\'s sake--work not at all. Enjoyment should not be the goal. First\nkill your self and then take the whole world as yourself; as the old\nChristians used to say, "the old man must die." This old man is the selfish\nidea that the whole world is made for our enjoyment. Foolish parents teach\ntheir children to pray, "O Lord, Thou hast created this sun for me and this\nmoon for me," as if the Lord has had nothing else to do than to create\neverything for these babies. Do not teach your children such nonsense. Then\nagain, there are people who are foolish in another way; they teach us that all\nthese animals were created for us to kill and eat, and that this universe is\nfor the enjoyment of men. That is all foolishness. A tiger may say, "Man was\ncreated for me," and pray, "O Lord, how wicked are these men, who do not come\nand place themselves before me to be eaten; they are breaking Your law." If\nthe world is created for us we are also created for the world. That this world\nis created for our enjoyment is the most wicked idea that holds us down. This\nworld is not for our sake; millions pass out of it every year; the world does\nnot feel it; millions of others are supplied in their place. Just as much as\nthe world is for us, so we are also for the world.\n\nTo work properly, therefore, you have first to give up the idea of attachment.\nSecondly, do not mix in the fray, hold yourself as a witness and go on\nworking. My master used to say, "Look upon your children as a nurse does." The\nnurse will take your baby and fondle it and play\n\np. 87\n\nwith it and behave towards it as gently as if it were her own child; but as\nsoon as you give her notice to quit, she is ready to start off with bag and\nbaggage from the house. Everything in the shape of attachment is forgotten; it\nwill not give the ordinary nurse the least pang to leave your children and\ntake up other children. Even so are you to be with all that you consider your\nown. You are the nurse, and if you believe in God, believe that all these\nthings which you consider yours are really His. The greatest weakness often\ninsinuates itself as the greatest good and strength. It is a weakness to think\nthat any one is dependent on me, and that I can do good to another. This\nbelief is the mother of all our attachment, and through this attachment comes\nall our pain. We must inform our minds that no one in this universe depends\nupon us; not one beggar depends on our charity; not one soul on our kindness;\nnot one living thing on our help. All are helped on by nature, and will be so\nhelped even though millions of us were not here. The course of nature will not\nstop for such as you and me; it is, as already pointed out, only a blessed\nprivilege to you and to me that we are allowed, in the way of helping others,\nto educate ourselves. This is a great lesson to learn in life, and when we\nhave learned it fully we shall never be unhappy; we can go and mix without\nharm in society anywhere and everywhere. You may have wives and husbands, and\nregiments of servants, and kingdoms to govern; if only you act on the\nprinciple that the world is not for you and does not inevitably need you, they\ncan do you no harm. This very year some of your friends may have died. Is the\nworld waiting without going on, for them to come again. Is its current\nstopped? No, it goes on. So drive out of your mind the idea that you have to\ndo something for the world; the world does not require any help from you. It\nis sheer nonsense on the part of any man to think that he is born\n\np. 88\n\nto help the world; it is simply pride, it is selfishness insinuating itself in\nthe form of virtue. When you have trained your mind and your nerves to realise\nthis idea of the world\'s non-dependence on you or on anybody, there will then\nbe no reaction in the form of pain resulting from work. When you give\nsomething to a man and expect nothing--do not even expect the man to be\ngrateful--his ingratitude will not tell upon you, because you never expected\nanything, never thought you had any right to anything in the way of a return;\nyou gave him what he deserved; his own Karma got it for him; your _Karma_ made\nyou the carrier thereof. Why should you be proud of having given away\nsomething? You are the porter that carried the money or other kind of gift,\nand the world deserved it by its own _Karma_. Where is then the reason for\npride in you? There is nothing very great in what you give to the world. When\nyou have acquired the feeling of non-attachment, there will then be neither\ngood nor evil for you. It is only selfishness that causes the difference\nbetween good and evil. It is a very hard thing to understand, but you will\ncome to learn in time that nothing in the universe has power over you until\nyou allow it to exercise such a power. Nothing has power over the Self of man,\nuntil the Self becomes a fool and loses independence. So, by non-attachment,\nyou overcome and deny the power of anything to act upon you. It is very easy\nto say that nothing has the right to act upon you until you allow it to do so;\nbut what is the true sign of the man who really does not allow anything to\nwork upon him, who is neither happy nor unhappy when acted upon by the\nexternal world? The sign is that good or ill fortune causes no change in his\nmind; in all conditions he continues to remain the same.\n\nThere was a great sage in India called Vyasa. This Vyasa is known as the\nauthor of the _Vedanta_ aphorisms, and was a holy man. His father had tried to\nbecome a\n\np. 89\n\nvery perfect man and had failed. His grandfather had also tried and failed.\nHis great-grandfather had similarly tried and failed. He himself did not\nsucceed perfectly, but his son, Shuka, was born perfect. Vyasa taught his son\nwisdom; and after teaching him the knowledge of truth himself, he sent him to\nthe court of King Janaka. He was a great king and was called Janaka Videha.\n_Videha_ means "without a body." Although a king, he had entirely forgotten\nthat he was a body; he felt that he was a spirit all the time. This boy Shuka\nwas sent to be taught by him. The king knew that Vyasa\'s son was coming to him\nto learn wisdom; so he made certain arrangements beforehand; and when the boy\npresented himself at the gates of the palace, the guards took no notice of him\nwhatsoever. They only gave him a seat, and he sat there for three days and\nnights, nobody speaking to him, nobody asking him who he was or whence he was.\nHe was the son of a very great sage; his father was honoured by the whole\ncountry, and he himself was a most respectable person; yet the low, vulgar\nguards of the palace would take no notice of him. After that, suddenly, the\nministers of the king and all the big officials came there and received him\nwith the greatest honours. They conducted him in and showed him into splendid\nrooms, gave him the most fragrant baths and wonderful dresses, and for eight\ndays they kept him there in all kinds of luxury. That solemnly serene face of\nShuka did not change even to the smallest extent by the change in the\ntreatment accorded to him; he was the same in the midst of this luxury as when\nwaiting at the door. Then he was brought before the king. The king was on his\nthrone, music was playing, and dancing and other amusements were going on. The\nking then gave him a cup of milk, full to the brim, and asked him to go seven\ntimes round the hall without spilling even a drop. The boy took the scup and\nproceeded in the midst of the music and the\n\np. 90\n\nattraction of the beautiful faces. As desired by the king, seven times did he\ngo round, and not a drop of the milk was spilt. The boy\'s mind could not be\nattracted by anything in the world, unless he allowed it to affect him. And\nwhen he brought the cup to the king, the king said to him. "What your father\nhas taught you, and what you have learned yourself, I can only repeat; you\nhave known the truth; go home."\n\nThus the man that has practised control over himself cannot be acted upon by\nanything outside; there is no more slavery for him. His mind has become free;\nsuch a man alone is fit to live well in the world. We generally find men\nholding two opinions regarding the world. Some are pessimists and say, "How\nhorrible this world is, how wicked!" Some others are optimists and say, "How\nbeautiful this world is, how wonderful!" To those who have not controlled\ntheir own minds, the world is either full of evil or at best a mixture of good\nand evil. This very world will become to us an optimistic world when we become\nmasters of our own minds. Nothing will then work upon us as good or evil; we\nshall find everything to be in its proper place, to be harmonious. Some men,\nwho begin by saying that the world is a hell, often end by saying that it is a\nheaven when they succeed in the practice of self-control. If we are genuine\n_Karma-Yogis_ and wish to train ourselves to the attainment of this state,\nwherever we may begin we are sure to end in perfect self-abnegation; and as\nsoon as this seeming self has gone, the whole world, which at first appears to\nus to be filled with evil, will appear to be heaven itself and full of\nblessedness. Its very atmosphere will be blessed; every human face there will\nbe good. Such is the end and aim of _Karma-Yoga_ , and such is its perfection\nin practical life.\n\nOur various _Yogas_ do not conflict with each other; each of them leads us to\nthe same goal and makes us perfect; only each has to be strenuously practised.\nThe\n\np. 91\n\nwhole secret is in practising. First you have to hear, then think, and then\npractise. This is true of every _Yoga_. You have first to hear about it and\nunderstand what it is; and many things which you do not understand will be\nmade clear to you by constant hearing and thinking. It is hard to understand\neverything at once. The explanation of everything is after all in yourself. No\none was ever really taught by another; each of us has to teach himself. The\nexternal teacher offers only the suggestion which rouses the internal teacher\nto work to understand things. Then things will be made clearer to us by our\nown power of perception and thought, and we shall realise them in our own\nsouls; and that realisation will grow into the intense power of will. First it\nis feeling, then it becomes willing, and out of that willing comes the\ntremendous force for work that will go through every vein and nerve and\nmuscle, until the whole mass of your body is changed into an instrument of the\nunselfish _Yoga_ of work, and the desired result of perfect self-abnegation\nand utter unselfishness is duly attained. This attainment does not depend on\nany dogma, or doctrine, or belief. Whether one is Christian, or Jew, or\nGentile, it does not matter. Are you unselfish? That is the question. If you\nare, you will be perfect without reading a single religious book, without\ngoing into a single church or temple. Each one of our _Yogas_ is fitted to\nmake man perfect even without the help of the others, because they have all\nthe same goal in view. The _Yogas_ of work, of wisdom, and of devotion are all\ncapable of serving as direct and independent means for the attainment of\n_Moksha_. "Fools alone say that work and philosophy are different, not the\nlearned." The learned know that, though apparently different from each other,\nthey at last lead to the same goal of human.. perfection.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VII. Freedom](kyog07.htm)\n\n'
