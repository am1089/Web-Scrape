The moon is its lotus, the sun its wild- duck, the\nclouds are its water-weeds, Mars is its shark and so on. Gorresio remarks:\n'This comparison of a great lake to the sky and of celestial to aquatic\nobjects is one of those ideas which the view and qualities of natural scenery\nawake in lively fancies. Imagine one of those grand and splendid lakes of\nIndia covered with lotus blossoms, furrowed by wild-ducks of the most vivid\ncolours, mantled over here and there with flowers and water weeds &c.; and it\nwill be understood how the fancy of the poet could readily compare to the sky\nradiant with celestial azure the blue expanse of the water, to the soft light\nof the moon the ****** hue of the lotus, to the splendour of the sun the\nbrilliant colours of the wild-fowl, to the stars the flowers, to the cloud the\nweeds that float upon the water &c.;'\n\n[425:1b](ry395.htm#fr_898) Sunabha is the mountain that rose from the sea when\nHanuman passed over to Lanka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXI.: The Feast of Honey.](ry396.htm)\n\n"
