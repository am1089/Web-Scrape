Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# RAMAYANA - CONCLUSION\n\nIn the concluding portion of the Uttara or Supplemental Book, the descendants\nof Rama and his brothers are described as the founders of the great cities and\nkingdoms which flourished in Western India in the fourth and fifth centuries\nbefore the Christian Era.\n\nBharat had two sons, Taksha and Pushkala. The former founded Taksha-sila, to\nthe east of the Indus, and known to Alexander and the Greeks as Taxila. The\nlatter founded Pushkala-vati, to the west of the Indus, and known to Alexander\nand the Greeks as Peukelaotis. Thus the sons of Bharat are said to have\nfounded kingdoms which flourished on either side of the Indus river in the\nfourth century before Christ.\n\nLakshman had two sons, Angada and Chandraketu. The former founded the kingdom\nof Karupada, and the latter founded the city of Chandrakanti in the Malwa\ncountry.\n\nSatrughna had two sons, Suvahu and Satrughati. The former became king of\nMathura, and the latter ruled in Vidisha.\n\nRama had two sons, Lava and Kusa. The former ruled in Sravasti, which was the\ncapital of Oudh at the time of the Buddha in the fifth and sixth centuries\nbefore Christ. The latter founded Kusavati at the foot of the Vindhya\nmountains.\n\nThe death of Rama and his brothers was in accordance with Hindu ideas of the\ndeath of the righteous. Lakshman died under somewhat peculiar circumstances. A\nmessenger from heaven sought a secret conference with Rama, and Rama placed\nLakshman at the gate, with strict injunctions that whoever intruded on the\nprivate conference should be slain. Lakshman himself had to disturb the\nconference by the solicitation of the celestial _rishi_ Durvasa, who always\nappears on earth to create mischief. And true to the orders passed by Rama, he\nsurrendered his life by penances, and went to heaven.\n\nIn the fulness of time, Rama and his other brothers left Ayodhya, crossed the\nSarayu, surrendered their mortal life, and entered heaven.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Epilogue](ramaepi.htm)\n\n'
