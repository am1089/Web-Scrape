Charm against demons (pisaka) conceived as the cause of disease.\n\n1\\. May Agni Vaisvanara, the bull of unfailing strength, burn up him that is\nevil-disposed, and desires to harm us, and him that plans hostile deeds\nagainst us!  \n2\\. Between the two rows of teeth of Agni Vaisvanara do I place him that plans\nto injure us, when we are not planning to injure him; and him that plans to\ninjure us, when we do plan to injure him.  \nThose who hound us in our chambers, while shouting goes on in the night of the\nnew moon, and the other flesh-devourers who plan to injure us, all of them do\nI overcome with might.  \n4\\. With might I overcome the Pisakas, rob them of their property; all evil-\ndisposed (demons) do I slay: may my device succeed!  \n5\\. With the gods who vie with, and measure their swiftness with this sun,\nwith those that are in the rivers, and in the mountains, do I, along with my\ncattle, consort.  \n6\\. I plague the Pisakas as the tiger the cattle-owners. As dogs who have seen\na lion, these do not find a refuge.  \n7\\. My strength does not lie with Pisakas, nor with thieves, nor with prowlers\nin the forest. From the village which I enter the Pisakas vanish away.  \n8\\. From the village which my fierce power has entered the Pisakas vanish\naway; they do not devise evil.  \n9\\. They who irritate me with their jabber, as (buzzing) mosquitoes the\nelephant, them I regard as wretched (creatures), as small vermin upon people.  \n10\\. May Nirriti (the goddess of destruction) take hold of this one, as a\nhorse with the halter! The fool who is wroth with me is not freed from (her)\nsnare.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 25.
