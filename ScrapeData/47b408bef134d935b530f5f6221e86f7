XI.\n\nThe Yadava race, or descendants of Yadu. Karttavirya obtains a boon from\nDattatreya: takes Ravan\xcc\x81a prisoner: is killed by Para\xc5\x9burama: his descendants.\n\nI WILL first relate to you the family of Yadu, the eldest son of Yayati, in\nwhich the eternal immutable Vishn\xcc\x81u descended upon earth in a portion of his\nessence 1; of which the glory cannot be described, though for ever hymned in\norder to confer the fruit of all their wishes--whether they desired virtue,\nwealth, pleasure, or liberation--upon all created beings, upon men, saints,\nheavenly quiristers, spirits of evil, nymphs, centaurs, serpents, birds,\ndemons, gods, sages, Brahmans, and ascetics. Whoever hears the account of the\nrace of Yadu shall be released from all sin; for the supreme spirit, that is\nwithout form, and which is called Vishn\xcc\x81u, was manifested in this family.\n\nYadu had four sons, Sahasrajit, Krosht\xcc\x81i, Nala, and Raghu 2. \xc5\x9aatajit was the\nson of the elder of these, and he had three sons, Haihaya, Ven\xcc\x81u 3, and Haya.\nThe son of Haihaya was Dharmanetra 4; his son was Kunti 5; his son was Sahanji\n6; his son was Mahishmat 7; his son\n\np. 417\n\nwas Bhadrasena 8; his son was Durdama; his son was Dhanaka 9, who had four\nsons, Kritaviryya, Kritagni, Kritavarman, and Kritaujas. Kritaviryya\'s son was\nArjuna, the sovereign of the seven Dwipas, the lord of a thousand arms. This\nprince propitiated the sage Dattatreya, the descendant of Atri, who was a\nportion of Vishn\xcc\x81u, and solicited and obtained from him these boons--a\nthousand arms; never acting unjustly; subjugation of the world by justice, and\nprotecting it equitably; victory over his enemies; and death by the hands of a\nperson renowned in the three regions of the universe. With these means he\nruled over the whole earth with might and justice, and offered ten thousand\nsacrifices. Of him this verse is still recited; "The kings of the earth will\nassuredly never pursue his steps in sacrifice, in munificence, in devotion, in\ncourtesy, and in self-control." In his reign nothing was lost or injured; and\nso he governed the whole earth with undiminished health, prosperity, power,\nand might, for eighty five thousand years. Whilst sporting in the waters of\nthe Narmada, and elevated with wine, Ravan\xcc\x81a came on his tour of triumph to\nthe city Mahishmati, and there he who boasted of overthrowing the gods, the\nDaityas, the Gandharbas and their king, was taken prisoner by Karttavirya, and\nconfined like a tame beast in a corner of his capital 10. At the expiration of\nhis long reign Karttavirya was killed by Para\xc5\x9burama, who was an embodied\nportion of the mighty Narayan\xcc\x81a 11. Of the hundred sons of this king, the five\nprincipal were \xc5\x9aura 12, \xc5\x9aurasena, Vrishan\xcc\x81a 13, Madhu 14, and\n\np. 418\n\n[paragraph continues] Jayadhwaja 15. The son of the last was Talajangha, who\nhad a hundred sons, called after him Talajanghas: the eldest of these was\nVitihotra; another was Bharata 16, who had two sons, Vrisha and Sujati 17. The\nson of Vrisha was Madhu 18; he had a hundred sons, the chief of whom was\nVrishn\xcc\x81i, and from him the family obtained the name of Vrishn\xcc\x81i 19. From the\nname of their father, Madhu, they were also called Madhavas; whilst from the\ndenomination of their common ancestor Yadu, the whole were termed Yadavas 20.\n\np. 419\n\nThis page consists solely of footnotes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[416:1](vp104.htm#fr_1099) Or, \'in which Krishn\xcc\x81a was born.\' It might have\nbeen expected, from the importance of this genealogy, that it would have been\nso carefully preserved, that the authorities would have closely concurred in\nits details. Although, however, the leading specifications coincide, yet, as\nwe shall have occasion to notice, great and irreconcilable variations occur.\n\n[416:2](vp104.htm#fr_1100) The two first generally agree. There are\ndifferences in the rest; as,\n\nVayu.\n\n|\n\nBrahma.\n\n|\n\nBhagavata.\n\n|\n\nKurma.  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \nNila\n\n|\n\nNala\n\n|\n\nNala\n\n|\n\nNila  \n  \nAjita\n\n|\n\nAnjika\n\n|\n\nAripu\n\n|\n\nJina  \n  \nRaghu\n\n|\n\nPayoda\n\n|\n\nAripu\n\n|\n\nRaghu  \n  \n[paragraph continues] The Brahma and Hari V. read Sahasrada for the first\nname; and the Linga has Balasani in place of Nala. The Agni makes \xc5\x9aatajit also\na son of Yadu.\n\n[416:3](vp104.htm#fr_1101) Ven\xcc\x81uhaya: Bhagavata, &c. Uttanahaya: Padma.\nVet\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81ahaya: Matsya. They were the sons of Sahasrada: Brahma and Hari V.\n\n[416:4](vp104.htm#fr_1102) Dharmatantra: Vayu.

See [p. 407](vp101.htm#page_407). n. [12](vp101.htm#fn_1080).\n\n[417:9](vp104.htm#fr_1107) Kanaka: Vayu, &c. Varaka: Linga. Andhaka: Kurma.\n\n[417:10](vp104.htm#fr_1108) According to the Vayu, Karttavirya was the\naggressor, invading Lanka, and there taking Ravan\xcc\x81a prisoner. The\ncircumstances are more usually narrated as in our text.\n\n[417:11](vp104.htm#fr_1109) See page 402. Karttavirya\'s fate was the\nconsequence of an imprecation denounced by \xc3\x81pava or Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, the son of\nVarun\xcc\x81a, whose hermitage had been burnt, according to the Mahabharata, Raja-\ndharma, by Chitrabhanu, or Fire, to whom the king had in his bounty presented\nthe world. The Vayu makes the king himself the incendiary, with arrows given\nhim by Surya to dry up the ocean.\n\n[417:12](vp104.htm#fr_1110) Urjjita: Bhagavata.\n\n[417:13](vp104.htm#fr_1111) Vrishabha: Bhagavata.

The Brahma and Hari V. make him the son of Vrisha, but do\nnot say whose son Vrisha was. The commentator on the latter asserts that the\nname is a synonyme of Payoda, the son of Yadu, according to his authority, and\nto that alone.\n\n[418:19](vp104.htm#fr_1117) The Bhagavata agrees with our text, but the\nBrahma, Hari V., Linga, and Kurma make Vrishan\xcc\x81a the son of Madhu, and derive\nthe family name of Vrishn\xcc\x81is or Varshn\xcc\x81eyas from him.\n\n[418:20](vp104.htm#fr_1118) The text takes no notice of some collateral\ntribes, which appear to merit remark. Most of the other authorities, in\nmentioning the sons of Jayadhwaja, observe that from them came the five great\ndivisions of the Haihaya tribe. These, according to the Vayu, were the\nTalajanghas, Vitihotras, \xc3\x81vantyas, Tun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikeras, and Jatas. The Matsya and\nAgni omit the first, and substitute Bhojas; and the latter are included in the\nlist in the Brahma, Padma, Linga, and Hari V. For Jatas the reading is\nSanjatas or Sujatas. The Brahma P. has also Bharatas, who, as well as the\nSujatas, are not commonly specified, it is said, \'from their great number.\'\nThey are in all probability invented by the compiler out of the names of the\ntext, Bharata and Sujati. The situation of these tribes is central India, for\nthe capital of the Talajanghas was Mahishmati or Chuli-Maheswar, still called,\naccording to Col. Tod, Sahasra-bahuki-basti, \'the village of the thousand-\narmed;\' that is, of Karttaviryya. Annals of Rajasthan, I. 39. n. The\nTun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikeras and Vitihotras are placed in the geographical lists behind the\nVindhyan mountains, and the termination -kaira is common in the valley of the\nNarmada, as Bairkaira, &c., or we may have Tun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikera abbreviated, as\nTun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ari on the Tapti. The \xc3\x81vantyas were in Ujayin, and the Bhojas were in\nthe neighbourhood probably of Dhar in Malwa. These tribes must have preceded,\nthen, the Rajput tribes, by whom these countries are now occupied, or\nRahtores, Chauhans, Pawars, Gehlotes, and the rest. There are still some\nvestiges of them, and a tribe of Haihayas still exists, at the top of the\nvalley of Sohagpur in Bhagel-khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81, aware of their ancient lineage, and\nthough p. 419 few in number, celebrated for their valour. Tod\'s Rajasthan, I.\n39. The scope of the traditions regarding them, especially of their\noverrunning the country, along with \xc5\x9aakas and other foreign tribes, in the\nreign preceding that of Sagara (see p. 373), indicates their foreign origin\nalso; and if we might trust to verbal resemblances, we might suspect that the\nHayas and Haihayas of the Hindus had some connexion with the Hia, Hoiei-ke,\nHoiei-hu, and similarly denominated Hun or Turk tribes, who make a figure in\nChinese history. Des Guignes, Histoire des Huns, I. 7, 55, 231. II. 253, &c.\nAt the same time it is to be observed that these tribes do not make their\nappearance until some centuries after the Christian era, and the scene of\ntheir first exploits is far from the frontiers of India: the coincidence of\nappellation may be therefore merely accidental. In the word Haya, which\nproperly means \'a horse,\' it is not impossible, however, that we have a\nconfirmatory evidence of the Scythian origin of the Haihayas, as Col. Tod\nsupposed; although we cannot with him imagine the word \'horse\' itself is\nderived from haya. Rajasthan, I. 76.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XII](vp105.htm)\n\n'
