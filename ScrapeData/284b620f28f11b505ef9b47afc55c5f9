Vyasa said :-- O King! Now seeing V _r_ itra slain, Vi _sn_ u, the Deva\nof the Devas, went to Vaikun _t_ ha; but, with this fear reigning supreme in\nhis mind that it was He that virtually slew him. Indra, too, then became\nafraid of the sin committed by him and returned to his Heavens. The Munis,\ntoo, became very anxious and thought what great sin they have committed in\ncheating V _r_ itrasura. It is the company of Indra that now made their name\n\xc2\x93Munis\xc2\x94 as meaningless. The Munis thought thus :-- \xc2\x93Oh! V _r_ itra on our\nwords trusted Indra and we have thus turned out today traitors in company with\nthat traitor Indra. Attachment and affection is the cause of all mischief. Fie\non that attachment! It is, as it were, tied by the cord of affection that we\nhad sworn falsely on oath and thus deceived V _r_ itra. Those that\ndeliberately guide others to vicious acts or those that advise or incite\nothers to do sinful acts or those that side with the sinners certainly partake\nof the fruits of the sin committed. Vi _sn_ u, too, committed the sin, though\nhe had Sattva Gu _n_ a preponderance, when he entered into the thunderbolt and\nthus helped Indra in killing V _r_ itra. It seems that henceforth the people,\nwhen selfish, won't\n\n\n\np. 504\n\n\n\nhesitate to commit afterwards any sinful act when they will see that Bhagavan\nVi _sn_ u could have done, in concert with Indra, such a vicious thing. Of the\nfour virtues Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Mok _s_ a, Dharma and Mok _s_ a are very\nrare in the three worlds. Artha (wealth) and Kama (desires) are everywhere\nrecommended as excellent and therefore held very dear; Dharma is now merely in\nname and is the cause of the vanity of the Pundits (no one now really\npractises Dharma with devotion). Thus arguing, the Munis became very much\nafflicted in their minds and went back to their own hermitages respectively,\nbroken-hearted and absent-minded. O Bharata! Hearing of the death of his son\nby Indra, Vis\xc2\x92vakarma wept very much and he become disgusted very much with\nthe affairs of the world. He went to the place where lay his son V _r_ itra\nand became pained very much to see him in that state; and he performed his\ncremation and other funeral obsequies according to the prescribed rules. He\nthen bathed, performed his Tarpa _n_ am (peace-offering) and funeral\nceremonies due to a person in the first year of his death. Then his heart\nbecame afflicted with sorrow and he cursed the vicious Indra saying that as\nIndra had killed his son, enticing him by falsely swearing on oath, so Indra,\nin his turn would suffer a heavier suffering, to be inflicted by Vidhi (the\nGreat Creator of Universe). O King! Thus cursing Indra, Vis\xc2\x92vakarma, very much\nafflicted due to the loss of his son, went to the top of the Mountain Meru and\nbegan to practise a hard tapasya.\n\n\n\n17\\. Janamejaya said :-- \xc2\x93O Grandsire! First tell me what happiness or pain\ndid Indra derive by killing V _r_ itra, the son of Tva _st_ a.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n18-40. Vyasa said :-- O fortunate One! What are you asking? and what is the\nnature of your doubt? The fruit of one's Karma is certainly to be enjoyed,\nwhether it be auspicious or inauspicious. Be he weak or strong. Be he a Deva,\nan Asura or a human being, everyone in fact, will have to suffer for one's\nKarma, good or bad, to its full extent, whether it be done a little or too\nmuch. See! It was Vi _sn_ u that gave advice to Indra and entered into his\nthunderbolt and helped him when Indra was ready to kill V _r_ itra; but when\nthere had been Indra's difficult time, Vi _sn_ u did not help Indra in any\nway. Therefore, O King! It is clear that when one's time is favourable,\neverybody turns out friends; but when Fate turns adverse, nobody is seen to\ncome forward to help. When Fate is against anybody, one's father, mother,\nwife, or brother, servant, friend or one's own son becomes quite incapable to\nhelp anybody. The man, who does good or bad acts, suffers for his deeds. When\nV _r_ itra was killed, everyone went back to their respective homes; but\nIndra, the Lord of S\xc2\x92achi, became very much deprived of his energy and\nbrilliancy due to the sin of his kill-\n\n\n\np. 505\n\n\n\ning a Brahmi _n_ ; all the Devas, then, blamed him as a Brahmaghataka (the\nkiller of a Brahmi _n_ ). They talked further that no other body would have\nbeen able to even indulge the idea of killing a Muni who was an intimate\nfriend and who placed full confidence on him when Indra had sworn on oath that\nhe would be a friend to V _r_ itra. O King! Everywhere then there was this\ngossip in the assemblages of the gods, in their gardens, at the meetings of\nthe Gandharbas that Indra had deceived V _r_ itra who had relied on him, on\nthe words of the Munis and then killed him by pretext, and so had done,\nindeed, a horrible crime. Indra had now forsaken the eternal proofs of the\nVedas; and he had become a Bauddha; therefore he could have easily killed V\n_r_ itra. No other body, save Vi _sn_ u and Indra, could have acted contrary\nto their words, as clearly evidenced by the manner in which V _r_ itra had\nbeen killed. These remarks, similar to those mentioned above, became\neverywhere current and Indra heard all of them, tending to his own disgrace. O\nKing! Fie on that man's life that is blamed everywhere! Fie on that man whose\nfame has been marred amongst the people. Such a person becomes laughed at by\nhis enemies, when seen by them on the way. The royal saint Indradyumna (Rajar\n_s_ i) was made to get down, though sinless, from Heavens when his good deeds\nexpired. Why, then, would not vicious persons be made to descend? The king\nYayati had to get down from Heavens for his very little fault and had to pass\neighteen Yugas in the form of a crab. What more can be said than the fact that\neven the Bhagavan Achyut Hari had to take several incarnations in the wombs of\nboar, crocodile, etc., out of the curse from a Brahmi _n_ , due to his cutting\noff the bead of the wife of Bhrigu. Though omnipresent, yet he had to take the\nappearance of a dwarf and had to beg from the King Vali's palace. What more\ntroubles and miseries than this can be inflicted on those that had sinned\nviciously. O Ornament of Bharata! Ramchandra, too, had to experience, due to\nthe curse of Bhrigu, terrible miseries on the bereavement of Sita Devi.\nSimilarly Indra, too, for his sin of killing a Brahmi _n_ , was so much\nterrified that he could not get his healthy condition though he remained in\nhis own house, endowed with all sorts of prosperity and wealth. Seeing, then,\nIndra lustreless, knowledge-less, almost void of consciousness, and\noverwhelmed with fear, his wife S\xc2\x92achi, the daughter of Puloma, spoke to him\nthus :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! Your dreadful enemy has been killed; why are you, then,\nsighing so much, being afflicted with so much terror? O Lord! You have\ndestroyed your enemy; then why are you so much anxious? why are you then so\nmuch remorseful and drawing such deep heavy sighs like an ordinary man? I am\nnot seeing any other powerful enemy of yours; then, why do you look so anxious\nand bowed down with cares, as if you look quite unconscious.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 506\n\n\n\n41-44. Indra said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! True that I have no other powerful enemy, yet I\ndo not find peace nor any happiness. I fear for the sin Brahmahattya in my\nhouse. O Devi! This Nandana Garden, the city of Kuvera, the lord of riches,\nthis nectar forest, the sweet music of the Gandbarbas, the beautiful dance of\nthe Apsaras, all these now do not give the least pleasure to me. What more can\nI say than this that the beautiful Lady like you, most beautiful amidst the\nthree worlds, and other beautiful ladies, the Heavenly cow, the Mandara tree\n(one of the five trees of the celestial region), the Parijata tree (the flower\ntree), the Santana tree, the Kalpa tree (yielding all desires) and the\nHarichandan (saffron tree) and others cannot give pleasure to me. What to do,\nwhere to go, so that I get happiness, O Beloved! This thought makes me uneasy.\nAnd so I am not able to get happiness in my own thought.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n45-60. Vyasa said :-- Thus speaking to his most distressed wife, Indra got out\nof his house and went to the exceedingly beautiful lake, named Manasarovara.\nIndra there entered into the tubular stalk of the lotus, his body becoming\nvery lean and thin out of the fear and sorrow. Nobody could recognise him as\nhe was overpowered by his terrible sin. He then began to behave himself, as\nregards feeding and enjoying, like a snake; and he became ovewhelmed with\nthought, helpless, and his organs were out of order, He remained hidden in the\nwater. When Indra, the king of the Devas, thus fled away out of the fear of\nhis Brahmahattya sin, the other Devas became very anxious; everywhere various\nevil signs manifested themselves. The Ri _s_ is, Siddhas and Gandharbas were\nvery much panic-stricken, as various disturbances and violent symptoms covered\nall over the world without any king. Grains began to grow very scanty, due to\nwant of rains; the streams were almost dry and very little water was there in\nthe tanks. In such a state of anarchism, all the inhabitants of the celestial\nregions, the Devas and Ri _s_ is consulted and installed the king Nahu _s_ a\nin the place of Indra. O King! Nahu _s_ a, though virtuous, became, under the\nsway of Rajogu _n_ a, influenced by lust and thus he got very much addicted to\nworldly enjoyments. He began to amuse himself in the Garden of Paradise,\nsurrounded by the Apsaras or celestial nymphs. One day he heard of the\nexcellent qualifications of S'achi Devi, the wife of Indra, and desired to\nacquire her. Then he spoke to the Ri _s_ is :-- The Devas and you, united,\nhave installed me in the office of Indra; but why does not the Indrani (the\nwife of Indra), come to me so long? If you want to do what I like, then\nquickly bring S'achi here before me for my gratification. I am now Indra and\ntherefore the god of the Devas and all the worlds; therefore bring today\nquickly Indrani to my house. Hearing thus the words\n\n\n\np. 507\n\n\n\nof the king Nahu _s_ a, the Devas and Devar _s_ is became anxious and went to\nS'achi, and, with their heads bowed down, spoke thus :-- \xc2\x93O Wife of Indra! The\nwicked Nahu _s_ a is now desiring you; he became angry and told as to send you\nto him quickly; O Devi! We have made him Indra and are therefore under him;\nwhat shall we do now under these circumstances?\xc2\x94 S'achi, the wife of Indra,\nhearing their words, became absent-minded and spoke to Brihaspati, thus :-- \xc2\x93O\nBrahma _n_ a! I now take refuge unto you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n61-62. Brihaspati said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! Do not be afraid of Nahu _s_ a; he has\nbeen deluded by Moha. O Child! I won't forsake the eternal religion and thus I\nwon't give you over to the hands of Nahu _s_ a. No doubt that wretch suffers\nthe severest torments in Hell to the end of Pralaya (the Great Dissolution)\nwho quits and hands over the distressed person under one's refuge to another.\nO Good One! Be comfortable; I will never forsake you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventh Chapter of the Sixth Book on Indra's living under\ndisguise in the Manas Lake in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 8](bk06ch08.htm)\n\n"
