Narada said :-- I have heard the anecdote of Tulasi. Now describe in\ndetail the history of Savitri. Savitri is considered as the Mother of the\nVedas. Why was She born, in days gone by? By whom was She first worshipped and\nsubsequently also?\n\n\n\np. 906\n\n\n\n3-4. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Muni! She was first worshipped by Brahma. Next\nthe Vedas worshipped her. Subsequently the learned men worshipped her. Next\nthe King As\xc2\x92vapati worshipped Her in India. Next the four Var _n_ as (castes)\nworshipped Her.\n\n\n\n5\\. Narada said :-- O Brahma _n_! Who is that As\xc2\x92vapati? What for did he\nworship? When the Devi Savitri became adorable by all, by which persons was\nShe first worshipped and by which persons subsequently?\n\n\n\n6-14. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Muni! The King As\xc2\x92vapati reigned in Bhadrades\xc2\x92a,\nrendering his enemies powerless and making his friends painless. He had a\nqueen very religious; her name was Malati; She was like a second Lak _s_ mi.\nShe was barren; and desirous of an issue, She under the instruction of Vas\xc2\x92i\n_st_ ha, duly worshipped Savitri with devotion. But She did not receive any\nvision nor any command; therefore She returned home with a grievous heart.\nSeeing her sorry, the king consoled her with good words and himself\naccompanied her to Pu _s_ kara with a view to perform Tapas to Savitri with\ndevotion and, being self-controlled, practised tapasya for one hundred years.\nStill he could not see Savitri, but voice came to him. An incorporeal,\ncelestial voice reached his ears :-- \xc2\x93Perform Japam (repeat) ten lakhs of\nGayatri Mantram.\xc2\x94 At this moment Parasara came up there. The king bowed down\nto him. The Muni said :-- O King! One japa of Gayatri, destroys the days sins.\nTen Japams of Gayatri destroy day and night\xc2\x92s sins.\n\n\n\n15-40. One hundred Gayatri Japams destroy one month\xc2\x92s sins. One thousand\nJapams destroy one year\xc2\x92s sins. One lakh Gayatri Japams destroy the sins of\nthe present birth and ten lakh Gayatri Japams destroy the sins of other\nbirths. One hundred lakhs of Japams destroy the sins of all the births. If ten\ntimes that (i.e., 1,000 lakhs) be done, then liberation is obtained. (Now the\nmethod, how to make Japam). Make the palm of the (right) hand like a snake\xc2\x92s\nhood; see that the fingers are all close, no holes are seen; and make the ends\nof the fingers bend downwards; then being calm and quiet and with one\xc2\x92s face\neastward, practise Japam. Then count from the middle of the ring (name-less)\nfinger and go on counting right-handed (with the hands of the watch) till you\ncome to the bottom of the index finger. This is the rule of counting by the\nhand. O King! The rosary is to be of the seed of white lotus or of the\ncrystals; it should be consecrated and purified. Japam is to be done then in a\nsacred Tirtha or in a temple. Becoming self-controlled one should place the\nrosary on a banyan leaf or on a lotus leaf and smear it with cowdung; wash it,\nuttering Gayatri Mantra and over it perform one hundred times Gayatri Japam\nintently in accordance with\n\n\n\np. 907\n\n\n\nthe rules. Or wash it with Pa\xc3\xb1chagavya, milk, curds, clarified butter, cow\nurine and cowdung, and then consecrate it well. Then wash it with the Ganges\nwater and perform best the consecrations. O Rajar _s_ i! Then perform ten\nlakhs of Japam in due order. Thus the sins of your three births will be\ndestroyed and then you will see the Devi Savitri. O King! Do this Japam, being\npure, everyday in the morning, mid-day, and in the evening. If one be impure\nand devoid of Sandhya, one has no right to do any action; and even if one\nperforms an action, one does not get any fruit thereby. He who does not do the\nmorning Sandhya and the evening Sandhya, is driven away from all the Brahmi\n_n_ ic Karmas and he becomes like S\xc2\x92udras. He who does Sandhya three times\nthroughout his life, becomes like the Sun by his lustre and brilliance of\ntapas. What more than this, the earth is always purified by the dust of his\nfeet. The Dvija who does his Sandhya Bandanam and remains pure, becomes\nenergetic and liberated while living. By his contact all the Tirthas become\npurified. All sins vanish away from him as snakes fly away at the sight of\nGaru _d_ a. The Dvija who becomes void of Sandhya three times a day, the Devas\ndo not accept his worship nor the Pitris accept his Pi _nd_ as. He who has no\nBhakti towards the Mula Prakriti, who does not worship the specific seed\nMantra of Maya and who does not hold festivities in honour of Mula Prakriti,\nknow him verily to be an Ajagara snake without poison. Devoid of the Vi _sn_ u\nmantra, devoid of the three Sandhyas and devoid of the fasting on the Ekadas\xc2\x92i\nTithi (the eleventh clay of the fortnight), the Brahmi _n_ becomes a snake\ndevoid of poison. The vile Brahmi _n_ who does not like to take the offerings\ndedicated to Hari and who does the washerman\xc2\x92s work and eats the food of\nS\xc2\x92udra and drives the buffaloes, becomes a snake devoid of poison. The Brahmi\n_n_ who burns the dead bodies of the S\xc2\x92udras, becomes like the man who is the\nhusband of an unmarried girl. The Brahmi _n_ also who becomes a cook of a\nS\xc2\x92udra, becomes a snake void of poison. The Brahmi _n_ who accepts the gifts\nof a S\xc2\x92udra, who performs the sacrifice of a S\xc2\x92udra, who lives as clerks and\nwarriors becomes like a snake void of poison. The Brahmi _n_ who sells his\ndaughter, who sells the name of Hari or eats the food of a woman who is\nwithout husband and son, as well as of one who has just bathed after her\nmenstruation period, becomes like a serpent void of poison. The Brahmi _n_ who\ntakes the profession of pimps and pampers and lives on the interest, is also\nlike a serpent void of poison. The Brahmi _n_ who sleeps even when the Sun has\nrisen, eats fish, and does not worship the Devi is also like a poisonless\nserpent. Thus stating all the rules of worship in order, the best of the Munis\ntold him the Dhyanam, etc., of the Devi\n\n\n\np. 908\n\n\n\nSavitri, what he wanted. Then he informed the King of all the mantras and went\nto his own \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama. The king, then worshipped accordingly and saw the Devi\nSavitri and got boons.\n\n\n\n41-43. Narada said :-- What is the Savitri\xc2\x92s Dhyan, what are the modes of her\nworship, what is stotra, mantra, that Paras\xc2\x92ara gave to the King before he\nwent away? And how did the King worship and what boon did he get? This great\nmystery, grand and well renowned in the S\xc2\x92rutis, about Savitri, I am desirous\nto hear in brief on all the points.\n\n\n\n44-78. Naraya _n_ a said :-- On the thirteenth day (the trayodas\xc2\x92i tithi) of\nthe black fortnight in the month Jyaistha or on any other holy period, the\nfourteenth day (the chaturdas\xc2\x92i tithi) this vow is to be observed with great\ncare and devotion. Fourteen fruits and fourteen plates with offerings of food\non them, flowers and incense are to be offered and this vow is to be observed\nfor fourteen years consecutively. Garments, holy threads and other articles\nare also offered and after the Vrata is over, the Brahmi _n_ s are to be fed.\nThe lucky pot (mangal gha _t_ ) is to be located duly according to the rules\nof worship with branches and fruits. Ga _n_ es\xc2\x92a, Ag _n_ i, Vi _sn_ u, S\xc2\x92iva\nand S\xc2\x92iva are to be worshipped duly.\n\n\n\nIn that gha _t_ Savitri is to be next invoked and worshipped. Now hear the\nDhyanam of Savitri, as stated in the Madhyan Dina Sakha, as well the stotra,\nthe modes of worship, and the Mantra, the giver of all desires. I meditate and\nadore that Savitri, the Mother of the Vedas, of the nature of Pra _n_ ava\n(Om), whose colour is like the burnished gold, who is burning with Brahma teja\n(the fire of Brahma), effulgent with thousands and thousands of rays of the\nmidday summer Sun, who is of a smiling countenance adorned with jewels and\nornaments, wearing celestial garment (purified and uninflammable by fire), and\nready to grant blessings to Her Bhaktas; who is the bestower of happiness and\nliberation, who is peaceful and the consort of the Creator of the world, who\nis all wealth and the giver of all riches and prosperity, who is the Presiding\nDeity of the Vedas and who is the Vedas incarnate, I meditate on Thee. Thus\nreciting the Dhyanam, mantra and meditating on Her, one is to offer Naivedyas\n(offerings of food) to Her and then place one\xc2\x92s fingers on one\xc2\x92s head; one is\nto meditate again, and then invoke the Devi within the pot. One should next\npresent fourteen things, uttering proper mantras according to the Vedas. Then\none must perform special puja and chant hymns to the Devi and worship Her. The\nfourteen articles of worship are as under :--\n\n\n\np. 909\n\n\n\n(1) Seat (\xc3\x82san); (2) water for washing feet (Padya), (3) offering of rice and\nDurba grass (Arghya), (4) water for bath (Snaniya), (6) anointment with\nsandalpaste and other scents (Anulepana), (7) incense (Dhupa), (8) Lights\n(Dipa), (9) offerings of food (Naivedya), (10) Betels (Tambul), (11) Cool\nwater, (12) garments, (13) ornaments, (14) garlands, scents, offering of water\nto sip, and beautiful bedding. While offering these articles, one is to utter\nthe mantras, this beautiful wooden or golden seat, giving spiritual merits is\nbeing offered by me to Thee. This water from the Tirthas, this holy water for\nwashing Thy feet, pleasant, highly meritorious, pure, and as an embodiment of\nPuja is being offered by me to Thee. This holy Arghya with Durba grass and\nflowers and the pure water in the conch-shell is being offered by me to Thee\n(as a work of initial worship). This sweet scented oil and water being offered\nby me to Thee with devotion for Thy bathing purposes. Kindly accept these. O\nMother! This sweet-scented water Divine-like, highly pure and prepared of\nKunkuma and other scented things I offer to Thee. O Parames\xc2\x92vari! This all-\nauspicious, all good and highly meritorious, this beautiful Dhupa, kindly\ntake, O World Mother! This is very pleasant and sweet scented; therefore I\noffer this to Thee. O Mother! This light, manifesting all this Universe and\nthe seed, as it were, to destroy the Darkness is being offered by me to Thee.\nO Devi! Kindly accept this delicious offering of food, highly meritorious,\nappeasing hunger, pleasant, nourishing end pleasure giving. This betel is\nscented with camphor, etc., nice, nourishing, and pleasure-giving; this is\nbeing offered by me to Thee. This water is nice and cool, appeasing the thirst\nand the Life of the World. So kindly accept this. O Devi! Kindly accept this\nsilken garment as well as the garment made of Karpasa Cotton, beautifying the\nbody and enhancing the beauty. Kindly accept these golden ornaments decked\nwith jewels, highly meritorious, joyous, beauteous and prosperous. Kindly\naccept these fruits yielding fruits of desires, obtained from various trees\nand of various kinds. Please have this garland, all auspicious and all good,\nmade of various flowers, beauteous and generating happiness. O Devi! Kindly\naccept this sweet scent, highly pleasing and meritorious. Please take this\nSindura, the best of the ornaments, beautifying the forehead, highly excellent\nand beautiful. Kindly accept this holy and meritorious threads an purefied by\nthe Vedic mantrams and made of highly holy threads and knitted with highly\npure knots. Uttering thus, offer the above articles that are to be offered to\nthe Devi, every time the specific seed mantra being uttered. Then the\nintelligent devotee should recite the stotras and subsequently of the Dak _s_\ni _n_ as (presents) with devotion to the Brahma _n_ as. The Radical or the\nSpecific Seed Mantra mantra is the eight lettered mantra Srim Hrim Klim\nSvaitrai Svaha; So the sages know. The Stotra, as stated in the Madhyandina\n\n\n\np. 910\n\n\n\nS'akha, gives fruits of all desires. I am now speaking to you of that mantra,\nthe Life of the Brahma _n_ as. Listen attentively. O Narada! Savitri was given\nto Brahma, in the ancient times of old in the region of Goloka by Kri _sn_ a;\nbut Savitri did not come to Brahma loka with Brahma. Then by the command of\nKri _sn_ a, Brahma praised the mother of the Vedas. And when She got pleased,\nShe accepted Brahma as Her husband.\n\n\n\n79-87. Brahma said :-- Thou art the everlasting existence intelligence and\nbliss; Thou art Mulaprakriti; thou art Hira _n_ ya Garbha; Thou didst get\npleased, O Fair one! Thou art of the nature of fire and Energy; Thou art the\nHighest; Thou art the Highest Bliss, and the caste of the twice-born. Dost\nthou get appeased, O Fair One! Thou art eternal, dear to the Eternal; thou art\nof the nature of the Everlasting Bliss. O Devi, O Thou, the all auspicious\nOne! O Fair One! Beest thou satisfied. Thou art the form of all (omnipresent)!\nThou art the essence of all mantras of the Brahma _n_ as, higher than the\nhighest! Thou art the bestower of happiness and the liberator O Devi, O Fair\nOne! Beest thou appeased. Thou art like the burning flame to the fuel of sins\nof the Brahma _n_ as! O Thou, the Bestower of Brahma teja (the light of\nBrahma) O Devi! O Fair One! Beest appeased. By Thy mere remembrance, all the\nsins to me by body, mind and speech are burnt to ashes. Thus saying, the\nCreator of the world reached the assembly there. Then Savitri came to the\nBrahmaloka with Brahma. The King As\xc2\x92vapati chanted this stotra to Savitri and\nsaw Her and got from Her the desired boons. Whosoever recites this highly\nsacred king of Stotras after Sandhya Bandanam, quickly acquires the fruits of\nstudying the Vedas.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty Sixth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the narration of\nSavitri in S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 27](bk09ch27.htm)\n\n"
