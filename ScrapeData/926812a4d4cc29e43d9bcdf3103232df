Vyasa said :-- O King! Then Indra and all the Devas became very glad to\nsee the great Mahi _s_ asura slain; they all began to praise and chant hymns\nto the World-Mother.\n\n\n\n2-33. The Devas said :-- It is by thy Power that Brahma becomes able to create\nthis world, Vi _sn_ u, to preserve, and Mahes\xc2\x92vara to destroy during the\nPralaya time (the Great Dissolution) of this universe. But when they are\nbereft of Thy Power, they are quite unable to do such. Therefore, O Devi! Thou\nart undoubtedly the Prime Cause in the preservation and destruction of this\nwhole Universe. O Devi; Thou art, in this world, Fame, idea and ideal, memory;\nThou art the goal, mercy, compassion, faith, constancy, earth; Thou art\nKamala, the Mantra Ajapa, respiration and perspiration, nourishment, Jaya,\nVijaya (the destroyer of obstacles; a name of Durga); Thou art contentment,\ncorrect notion, measure, intellect, Rama (Lak _s_ mi), (wealth), knowledge,\nforgiveness, beauty, intelligence; Thou art the S\xc2\x92akti (power) of Rudra, Thou\nart Girija and the Energy of God Uma and all other forces in this universe;\nthis is known to everyone in the three worlds. Without any or all of these\nforces, no one is able to perform any action. Thou art the Supreme Cause of\nall this world. Therefore everything rests on Thee. If Thou wert not the\nupholding Power, how could Kurma (in the Tortoise Incarnation) and Ananta have\nupheld this world? O Mother! Wert Thou not this Earth, could all these world-\nload of things have rested on the sky? O Mother! Those human beings that\nworship Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Rudra, Moon, Fire, Yama, the God of Death, Vayu, Ga\n_n_ es\xc2\x92a, and the other Devas, they are certainly deluded by Thy Maya. Could\nall those Devas do any action or any favour without Thy Energy? O Mother!\nThose that offer in any Sacrifice, a profuse quantity of ghee (clarified\nbutter) as oblations to the several Devas, they are certainly conceived to be\nof very narrow views; Wert Thou not the Svaha, could it have been possible for\nthose Devas to get the offered oblations at that very instant? Certainly,\ntherefore, they are fools and ignorant persons. There is no doubt in this. O\nMother! Thou givest the several objects of nourishment and enjoyment to all\nthe beings in this universe by Thy parts (the several transformations of these\nmaterial things); it is Thou that nourishest the Devas, Thy devotees, as well\nas the others (the Danavas, according to their Karma). O Mother! As the owner\nof any garden plants, with pleasure, the beautiful trees in his\n\n\n\np. 419\n\n\n\ngarden for his delight and, finding some of them not to bear any fruits or\nleaves or of a bitter taste, does not cut them off by their roots, so, O Devi!\nThou hast brought into existence these Daityas out of their inferior Karmas\nand Thou art supporting them. Knowing that the Daityas like to enjoy the\ncelestial nymphs, Thou hast, out of compassion, killed them by their arrows in\nthe battlefield, to afford them facilities in their re-birth in Heavens and\nthus to enjoy the Deva women which they could not have got in any other\npossible way. Therefore this Thy dealings with them are to fulfil their\nintentions and not to kill them. O Mother! It is a great wonder that to kill\nthese Asuras Thou hadst to assume this Divine Body; Thou couldst have done so\nby Thy mere will. It seems that this act of Thine is but a mere Pastime. There\nis no other cause for this. O Devi! Those human beings that do not worship\nThee in this dreadful age of Kali, they are certainly deceived by the cunning\nPura _n_ a makers who have deluded them to worship Hari and Hara, who are Thy\ncreations. Oh! What an amount of evil has befallen to those poor souls! O\nDevi! Those men know that the Devas, tormented by the Asuras, are Thy\ndevotees, and yet they worship them; certainly such fellows, holding the\nlighted torches in their hands, plunge deep into the darkest waterless wells.\nO Mother! Thou art the Vidya (Blissful Intelligence) and Thou grantest\npleasure and liberation; Thou art the Avidya, (Great Delusion) and thus Thou\ncausest bondage and pain in this world. O Mother! Thou only destroyest the\naffliction of the human beings; those that want liberation worship Thee, and\nthose that are ignorant and attached to worldly enjoyments do not worship\nThee. What more can be said than this, that Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahe _s_ a and\nthe other Devas incessantly worship Thy adorable lotus-feet; but those men\nthat are of dull intellect and are mistaken, they do not meditate Thy feet\nand, therefore, they come again and again into this ocean of world. O Cha _nd_\nika! It is through the grace of the dust of Thy lotus-feet that Brahma, Vi\n_sn_ u, and Mahes\xc2\x92vara are creating, preserving and destroying this universe.\nTherefore, O Goddess! Those men that do not serve Thee, are certainly very\nunfortunate. O Mother of the Universe! Thou art the Goddess of speech of the\nSuras and the Asuras; thus if Thou didst not dwell in their mouths, they would\nnot have been able to utter a single word; therefore, O Goddess! How can men\nspeak, when they are thus deprived of Thee! O Mother! It is due to the curse\nof Bhrigu Muni that Hari takes several incarnations as Fish, Tortoise, Boar,\nMan-Lion, and deceitful Dwarf Incarnations; all these show clearly the\ndependence of Hari,\n\n\n\n*N.B. - The Devas and the Daityas are the opposite polarities of the same creation.\n\n\n\np. 420\n\n\n\nHow, then, can they avoid the fear of death when they serve these dependent\nincarnations! O Mother! It is well known that the male generative organ of\nS\xc2\x92ambhu, the Mahadeva fell unto the ground, owing to the curse of Bhrigu Muni,\nwhen he went to the hermitage of the Ri _s_ is. How can, then, happiness come\nin this world or in the next, to those who worship such a S\xc2\x92ambhu who wears\nhuman skulls on His body! O Devi! Those that worship Ga _n_ es\xc2\x92a, born of the\nabove qualified Maha Deva are awfully mistaken; they are especially quite\nignorant of Thee, the Goddess of the Universe, that can be easily worshipped\nand that can give the fourfold aims of human existence. O Devi! It is out of\nThy kindness that Thou hast slain with Thy arrows the enemies and thus hast\ntranslated them into Heavens; otherwise they would have certainly gone down to\nHell owing to their own Karmic effects. Brahma, Hari, Hara and the other Devas\ncannot realise Thy greatness; how can, then, ordinary men know Thee, when they\nare deluded by immeasureably strong Sattva, Rajas and Tamas qualities. O\nMother! Those who do not worship Thy lotus-feet as very hard to be brought\nwithin this mind and therefore worship this visible Sun and Fire, they cannot\ngrasp the Essence of the Vedas, demonstrated by hundreds of passages of\nS\xc2\x92ruti; they are deluded and simply suffer pains. O Mother! I think that the\ninfluences of Thy Sattva, Rajas and Tamas qualities are widely known in this\nworld; those qualities as taught in various deluding schools of Tantras by\nvarious persons, stimulate people to the worship of Vi _sn_ u, Mahes\xc2\x92vara, Sun\nand Ga _n_ es\xc2\x92a and thus detract them from worshipping Thee. O Mother! Those\nthat detract thus the Brahma _n_ as from worshiping Thy lotus-feet and advise\nthem through the \xc3\x82gamas, to worship Hari, Hara and others, Thou dost not get\nangry with them, rather Thou dost shew Thy kindness to them and make them\nwidely celebrated as possessing the occult powers of enchanting, bringing\nothers under their control, or attracting towards them various other persons.\nIn the Satya Yuga, Sattva Gu _n_ a was more powerful and therefore the untrue\nS\xc2\x92astras could not rear their heads; but in this Kali Age, owing to the Sattva\nGu _n_ a being not so powerful, the lower qualities have got preponderance; so\nthese so-called clever Pundits instead of worshipping Thee, worship Hari, Hara\nand the other Devas, the products of their fancy and hide Thee. O Mother! Thou\nart the Brahma Vidya, the knowledge of the Supreme Consciousness, Thou givest\nliberation to Thy devotees when they succeed in their Yogas. Therefore the\npure Sattvik Muni meditate on Thee and Thee alone. Those that get themselves\ndiluted in Thee, they are very blessed; what more to speak of them in their\npraise, they will no longer have to suffer any pains in their mother\xc2\x92s wombs!\nO Mother! Thou art inherent\n\n\n\np. 421\n\n\n\nas Chit S\xc2\x92akti (the power of consciousness) in the Supreme Spirit and\ntherefore He is become manifest specially as this Great Cosmos and becomes\nknown as the Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer of this world, fashioned out of\nfive elements. O Devi! What male can by his own power work out this Jagat\nPrapancha, enjoy it and move in this, without the aid of Thy power. O\nBhagavati! This universe has been created by Thee; Thou art, therefore, its\nMother. The twenty-four Essences or Tattvas are inert; how can they without\nThy Chits\xc2\x92akti, create this universe? O Devi! Never can these senses and\norgans, endowed with Gu _n_ a and Karma, do any work or bestow any fruits\nwithout Thy energy.\n\n\n\nO Mother! Wert thou not Svaha, the instrumental cause in the sacrifice, how\ncould the Devas have got their shares of the ghee offered in the Yaj\xc3\xb1as by the\nMunis! Therefore, O Devi! Thou art, no doubt, preserving this universe. O\nBhagavati! It is Thou that hast created this world in the beginning; it is\nThou that art preserving the gods Hari, Hara and others; it is Thou that art\ndestroying this universe. Therefore, O Brahma _n_! The Devas cannot know Thy\ndeeds; how can, then, the men who are of dull intellect, know Thee. O Mother!\nThou hast now saved the Devas by killing this terrible Mahi _s_ asura. O\nMother! All the Vedas have not been able to know exactly all Thy movements;\nhow can we, of dull intellect, praise Thee! O Mother! Thou has served our\ncause by killing our enemy, the wicked Danava, the inconceivable source of\npain to all the world by this act of Thine, Thy fame has spread far and wide\nin this universe; therefore, O Thou of renowned prowess! Thou art the Mother\nof this world; save us, and maintain us by Thy mercy.\n\n\n\n34-35. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Devas having praised the Devi thus, the Devi\naddressed them gently :-- \xc2\x93O Devas! Say if you have any other difficult thing\nfor Me to do; remember Me whenever any difficult crisis occurs to you; I will\ndestroy that evil.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n36-42. The Devas said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! All our purposes have been served when Thou\nhast killed lately our enemy Mahi _s_ asura. Now dost Thou do for us so that\nwe can always recollect Thy lotus feet, and our Bhakti be firm and steadfast\ntowards Thee. It is only the Mother the bears the thousand offences of the\nson; we, therefore, cannot say why men, knowing this, do not worship the\nMother of the Universe. There are two birds always dwelling in this body,\nJivatma (human soul) and the Paramatma (the Supreme Soul). They are so very\nintimate friends toward each other that they never separate. But there is no\nother third friend that can bear the faults of these two. Therefore the\nembodied soul that forsakes Thee, his friend, can never attain any welfare;\nwhat more to say\n\n\n\np. 422\n\n\n\non this! That vicious soul is very unlucky amidst the Devas and men, no doubt.\nHe who on attaining this excellent human body, attained with much difficulty,\ndoes not remember Thee frequently by words and deeds, is certainly the vilest\nof men. O Devi! Whether in times of distress or happiness, Thou art our\nSaviour; therefore dost Thou protect us with Thy best weapons. O Devi! There\nis no other means of our security than the Grace of the dust of Thy Feet.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n43\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Devas having prayed to the Devi thus, the Devi\nvanished then and there. The Devas, seeing the disappearance of the Devi, were\nsufficiently struck with surprise.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Nineteenth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the prayer and hymns to\nthe Devi in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 20](bk05ch20.htm)\n\n'
