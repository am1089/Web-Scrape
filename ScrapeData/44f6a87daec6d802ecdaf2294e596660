Where concentration of mind (is possible), there (meditation may be\ncarried on), on account of there being no difference.\n\nA doubt here arises with regard to direction, place, and\n\np. 351\n\ntime, viz. whether any restrictive rules exist or not.--Against the view of\nthose who maintain that such rules exist because we have analogous rules\nconcerning the locality, &c., of Vedic works, the Sutrakara remarks that all\nrules concerning direction, place, and time depend on the aim merely; that is\nto say: Let a man meditate at whatever time, in whatever place and facing\nwhatever region, he may with case manage to concentrate his mind. For while\nscripture prescribes an easterly direction, the time of forenoon, and a spot\nsloping towards the cast for certain sacrifices, no such specific rules are\nrecorded for meditation, since the requisite concentration may be managed\nindifferently anywhere.--But, an objection is raised, some passages record\nsuch specific rules, as e.g. the following one, 'Let a man apply himself (to\nmeditation) in a level and clean place, free from pebbles, fire and dust,\nnoises, standing water, and the like, favourable to the mind, not infested by\nwhat hurts the eyes, full of caves and shelters' ( _S_ vet. Up. II, 10).--Such\nparticular rules are met with indeed; but the teacher being friendly-minded\nsays that there is no binding rule as to the--particulars mentioned therein.\nThe clause 'favourable to the mind' moreover shows that meditation may be\ncarried on wherever concentration of the mind may be attained.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 1, 12](sbe38273.htm)\n\n"
