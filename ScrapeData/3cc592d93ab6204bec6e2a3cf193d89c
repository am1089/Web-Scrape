Vyasa said :-- OKing! The mother became astonished to hear me. Becoming\nvery anxious for a son, she began to speak to me. O Child! The wife of your\nbrother, the daughter Ambalika of Kas\xc2\x92iraj, is a widow; she is very sorrowful;\nshe is endowed with all auspicious signs and endowed with all good qualities;\nbetter cohabit with that beautiful young wife and get a child according to the\ntradition of the S\xc2\x92i _st_ as. Persons born blind are not entitled to kingdoms.\nTherefore take my word and procreate a beautiful son and thus keep my honour.\nO Muni! Hearing the mother\xc2\x92s words, I began to wait in Hastinapura till\nAmbalika, the daughter of Kas\xc2\x92iraj, finished her ablutions after menstruation.\nThat King\xc2\x92s daughter, of curling hairs, came to me alone at her mother-in-\nlaw\xc2\x92s order, and became very much abashed. Seeing me an ascetic with matted\nhairs on my head and void of every love sentiment, perspiration came on her\nface; her body turned pale and her\n\n\n\np. 572\n\n\n\nmind void of any love towards me. When I saw that lady trembling and pale\nbeside me, I angrily spoke :-- \xc2\x93O One of beautiful waist! When you have turned\nout pale, considering your own beauty, let your son be of a pale colour.\xc2\x94 Thus\nsaying I spent there that night with Ambalika. After enjoying her I took\nfarewell from my mother and went to my place.\n\n\n\n11-21. In due course, the two daughters of the King gave birth to two sons\nrespectively, one blind and the other pale. The son of Ambika was named\nDhritara _st_ ra; and the son of Ambalika was named Pa _nd_ u, as his colour\nwas pa _nd_ u (pale). Mother became absent-minded when she saw the two sons in\nthose states. After one year she again called me and said :-- \xc2\x93O Dvaipayana!\nThese two persons are not so fit to become kings; therefore beget one more son\nbeautiful and according to my liking.\xc2\x94 When I consented, she became very glad\nand, in due course, asked Ambika to embrace me and give birth to a son,\nendowed with extraordinary qualities, and fit to preserve the line worthy of\nthe Kuru dynasty. The bride did not then say anything on account of her\nbashfulness. But when I went in the night time according to my mother\xc2\x92s order,\nto the sleeping room, Ambika sent to me a maid-servant of Vichitravirya, full\nof youth and beauty, and adorned with various ornaments and clothings. That\nmaid-servant of beautiful hairs and of a swan-like gait adorned with garlands\nand red sandal-paste, came to me with many enchanting gestures and making me\ntake my seat on the cot, became herself merged in love sentiments. O Muni! I\nbecame pleased with her gestures and amorous sports and passed the night, full\nof love towards her and played and cohabited with her. At last I gladly gave\nher the boon, \xc2\x93O Fortunate One! Your child, begotten by me, will be endowed\nwith all good qualities, will be of good form, will be conversant with all the\nessences of Dharma, calm and quiet and truthful.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n22-34. In due course, a child named Vidura was born to her. Thus I had three\nsons; and in my mind grew up Maya and affection that these were my sons. When\nI saw again those three sons, heroic and full of manliness, the only cause of\nmy sorrow due to the bereavement of my son S\xc2\x92uka vanished away from my mind. O\nLord of Dvijas! Maya is very powerful and extremely hard to be abandoned by\nthose who are not masters of their senses; She enchants even the wise, though\nShe does not possess any form nor any substratum nor any support. I could not\nfind any peace, even in the forest, as my mind was attached to my mother and\nchildren. O Muni! My mind then began to oscillate like a pendulum and I\nremained sometime in Hastinapura and sometime on the\n\n\n\np. 573\n\n\n\nbanks of the Sarasvati. I could not stay in a certain fixed place. By\ndiscrimination, the knowledge sometimes flashed in my mind :-- Whose sons are\nthese? The attachment is nothing but merely a delusion. On my death they would\nnot be entitled to perform my S\xc2\x92raddha ceremony. These sons are begotten by\nways and manners not sanctioned by Dharma; what happiness can they bring to\nme? O Muni! The powerful Maya has caused this delusion in me. What! Knowing\nthis Samsara to be unreal, Alas! I have fallen into this well of the Darkness\nof delusion. Thus I repented when I thought over the matter deeply and when I\nwas alone in a solitary place. When, subsequently, through the mediation of\nBhi _s_ ma, the powerful Pa _nd_ u got the kingdom, I became pleased to see\nthe prosperity of my son. O Muni! This is also the creation of Maya. The\ndaughter of the King S\xc2\x92urasena, named Kunti, and the daughter of the King of\nMadra, named Madri became the two beautiful wives of Pa _nd_ u. Pa _nd_ u was\ncursed by a Brahma _n_ a that he would die if he cohabited with any woman; he\ntherefore became dispassionate and quitting his kingdom, went to the forest\nwith his two wives. Hearing Pa _nd_ u gone to the forest I felt pain and went\nto my son who was staying with his wives and consoling him, came to\nHastinapura, where I held a conversation with Dhritara _st_ ra and then came\nback to the banks of the river Sarasvati.\n\n\n\n35-50. Pa _nd_ u in his forest life, got five sons out of his wives by the\nDevas Dharma, Vayu, Indra, and the twin As\xc2\x92vins. Dharma, Vayu, and Indra begat\nrespectively of Kunti the three sons Yudhi _st_ hira, Bhimasena and Arju _n_\na; and the two As\xc2\x92vins begat of Madri the two sons Nakulu and Sahadeva. Once\nMadri, full of youth and beauty, was staying alone in a solitary place and Pa\n_nd_ u seeing her embraced her and due to the curse, died. When the funeral\npyre was ablaze, the chaste Madri entered into the fire and died a Sati. Kunti\nwas prevented from doing so, as she was to nurse and look after her young\nchildren. The Munis then took the sorrowful Kunti, the daughter of S\xc2\x92urasena,\nbereft of her husband to Hastinapur and handed her over to the high-souled Bhi\n_s_ ma and Vidura. When I came to hear this, my mind was greatly agitated to\nsee the pain and pleasure that other people suffered. Bhi _s_ ma, Vidura, and\nDhritara _st_ ra began to nourish and support Yudhi _st_ hira and others as\nthey considered them the sons of their dearest Pa _nd_ u. The cruel and wicked\nsons of Dhritara _st_ ra, Duryodhana and others united with each other and\nbegan to quarrel horribly with the sons of Pa _nd_ u. Dro _n_ acharya came\nthere accidentally and Bhi _s_ ma treated him with great respect and requested\nhim to stay in Hastinapura and educate the sons of Kuru. Kar _n_ a was the the\nson of\n\n\n\np. 574\n\n\n\nKunti, when she was young and unmarried; and he was quitted by her no sooner\nhe was born. The charioteer Suta (or carpenter) Adhiratha found him in a river\nand nourished him. Kar _n_ a was the foremost of the heroes and therefore the\ngreat favourite of Duryodhana. The enmity between Bhima and Duryodhana, etc.,\nbegan to grow greater day by day. Dhritara _st_ ra, thinking the difficult\nsituation of his children, fixed the residence of the sons of Pa _nd_ u at the\nVara _n_ avata city so that the quarrels might die away. Out of enmity,\nDuryodhana ordered his dear friend Purochana to build there a house of lac for\nthe Pa _nd_ avas. O Muni! When I heard that Kunti and her five sons were burnt\nin the lac-house, I became merged in the ocean of sorrows and thought that\nthey were my grandsons. I was overwhelmed with sorrow and began to search\nafter them in deep forests day and night till at last I found them in\nEkachakra city, lean and thin and very much distressed with sorrow.\n\n\n\n51-63. I became very glad to see them and sent them soon to the city of the\nKing Drupada. Wearing the deer\xc2\x92s skin, they went there dejected with sorrow in\nthe Brahmi _n_ \xc2\x92s dress and stayed in the royal court. The victorious Arju _n_\na shewed prowess and pierced the mark (the eye of the fish) and obtained Kri\n_sn_ a, the daughter of the King Drupada. By the order of the mother Kunti,\nthe five brothers married her. O Muni! I became very glad to see that they\nwere all married. The Pa _nd_ avas , then, accompanied by Panchali, soon went\nto Hastinapura. Dhritara _st_ ra then fixed Khandavaprastha as the residence\nof the Pa _nd_ avas. Vi _sn_ u, the son of Vasudeva, then performed the Yaj\xc3\xb1a\nwith the victorious Arju _n_ a and satisfied the Great Fire. The Pa _nd_ avas\nnext performed the Rajasuya sacrifice and that made me very glad. Seeing the\naffluence and prosperity of the Pa _nd_ avas and the great assembly hall\nbeautiful and exquisitely artistic, Duryodhana was burnt up, as it were, with\nmalice and made arrangements for play in dice, very injurious in its\nconsequences. S\xc2\x92akuni was expert in playing deceitfully and Yudhi _st_ hira\nthe son of Dharma, was not expert in this play. So Duryodhana made S\xc2\x92akuni\nplay for him and stole away all that Yudhi _st_ hira had and insulted, at\nlast, in the royal assembly, the daughter of Drupada, Yaj\xc3\xb1aseni and gave her\nmuch trouble. The Pa _nd_ avas then went with Panchali in an exile in the\nforest for twelve years. And I was very much grieved to hear this O Muni!\nThough I know all about the Sanatan Dharma, yet I was deluded and merged in\nthese worlds of pains and pleasures. Who am I? To whom do these sons belong?\nMy mind roams day and night on the thought of all these. O Muni! What shall I\ndo? And whither shall I go? I don\xc2\x92t find happiness anywhere; my mind is, as it\nwere, floating in a\n\n\n\np. 575\n\n\n\nrocking machine and it is never being fixed. O Best of Munis! You are all-\nknowing; solve my doubts so that my mental fever may be quietened and I may be\nhappy.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-fifth Chapter on the cause of Moha of Vyasa Deva asked\nbefore Narada in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 26](bk06ch26.htm)\n\n'
