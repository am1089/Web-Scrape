What supplication is to thy mind's taste [1](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:1:1)?\nWhat (pious) thought may be, O Agni, most agreeable to thee? Or who has won\nfor himself thy wisdom by sacrifices? Or with what thoughts may we worship\nthee [2](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:1:2)?\n\n2\\. Come hither, Agni, sit down here as a Hot _ri_. Become our undeceivable\nleader [1](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:2:1). May Heaven and Earth, the all-embracing,\nprotect thee. Offer the sacrifice to the gods that they may be highly gracious\nto us.\n\n3\\. Burn down all sorcerers, O Agni; become a protector of the sacrifices\nagainst imprecations. And. conduct hither the lord of Soma (Indra) with his\ntwo bay horses. We have prepared hospitality for him, the good giver.\n\n4\\. With words procuring offspring, carrying thee (to our sacrifice) with my\nmouth [1](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:4:1), I call [2](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:4:2) thee\nhither, and thou shalt sit down here with the gods. Perform the service of a\nHot _ri_ and of a Pot _ri_  [3](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:4:3), O worshipful one.\nBe thou a giver and a father [4](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:4:4) of riches.\n\n5\\. As thou didst perform sacrifice to the gods with the sacrificial food of\nthe wise Manu [1](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:5:1), a sage together with sages, thus,\nO highly truthful Hot _ri_ , perform thou the sacrifice to-day, O Agni, with\nthy joy-giving sacrificial ladle [2](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:5:2).\n\np. 97\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Saya _n_ a takes vara in the sense of 'holding back' (comp. I, 143,\n5), and makes manasa _h_ depend on varaya. He says, 'he agne te tava manaso\nvaraya nivara _n_ ayasmasv. avasthapanaya kopetir bhuvat kid _ri_ _s_ am\nupagamana _m_ bhavet.' The modern translators are evidently right in assigning\nto vara the meaning of 'wish' or the like (comp. VII, 59, 2. ya _h_ va _h_\nvaraya da\xc2\xb4 _s_ ati), but they differ as to whether manasa _h_ should be taken\nas belonging to varaya or to upeti _h_. Ludwig translates, 'Welches nahen des\ngeistes ist gegenstand der wal dir?' Grassmann, 'Welch Nahen ist nach deines\nHerzens Wunsche?' My opinion is that the tradition of the text is not quite\nfree from suspicion. My doubts are based on VI, 21, 4. kas te ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_\nmanase _s_ am varaya, 'What sacrifice (O Indra) is agreeable to thy mind, to\nthy wish?' Here we have a question addressed to the god, beginning with kas\nte, quite similar to the question of our poet, which begins with ka\xc2\xb4 te. We\nhave the word _s_ am, as in our passage _s_ a _m_ tama. We have varaya exactly\nas in our passage. We have, by the side of varaya, a case-form of manas as in\nour passage. But we have the dative manase instead of the genitive manasa _h_.\nWe may add that there are some other passages in which a dative of a similar\nmeaning stands likewise by the side of varaya: thus, VIII, 82, 3. aram varaya\nmanyave bhuvat te indra _s_ am (comp. bhuvat agne _s_ a _m_ tama in our\npassage) h _ri_ de, 'May it be, O Indra, according to thy wish and thy mood,\nmay it be agreeable to thy heart;' VIII, 84, 4. varaya deva manyave, 'to thy\nwish, O god, to thy mood.'\n\nAll this tends to raise the supposition that in our\n\np. 98\n\npassage also we should read manase varaya, which datives seem to depend on _s_\na _m_ tama. We should then translate, 'What supplication, what (pious) thought\nmay be, O Agni, most agreeable to thy mind and to thy wish?'\n\nNote 2. This seems to be a Pada of the defective type, with four syllables\nbefore the caesura and ending as if there were five syllables before the\ncaesura; comp. my Prolegomena, 68 seq. It would be easy, however, to restore\nthe normal metrical form, for instance, by reading tubhyam instead of te.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Pura _h_ -eta\xc2\xb4, literally, 'he who goes before somebody.'\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. It would be unnatural to give to the medium a\xc2\xb4 huve the passive sense\nand not to translate it, as it must be translated in so many passages, 'I call\n(thee) hither.' But, if so, it is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that\nvahni _h_ asa\xc2\xb4 ('he who carries somebody with his mouth;' comp. I, 129, 5; VI,\n11, 2; 16, 9; VII, 16, 9; X, 115, 3 see vol. xxxii, pp. 42 seq.) refers here\nnot to Agni, the divine carrier, but to the human priest, who with his mouth,\ni. e. by his songs, carries Agni to his sacrifice. Vahni is used very\nfrequently indeed of human worshippers, and generally the transferring of\nepithets of the divine priest Agni to human priests, and vice versa, is quite\nto the taste of Vedic poets.--Comp. on a\xc2\xb4 huve and vahni _h_ asa\xc2\xb4, Neisser,\nBezzenberger's Beitrage, XVIII, 320 seq.; XX, 69, and below, I, 127, 8, note\n1; S. B. E., vol. xxxii, p. 42. See also Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, 473,\nwho very rightly observes: es liegt kein Grund vor, dem huve den Character\neiner ersten Person zu versagen.\n\nNote 2.
