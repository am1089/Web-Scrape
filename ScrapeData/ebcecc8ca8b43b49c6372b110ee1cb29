One (verse), \'You both the gladdening one\' (Rig-veda X, 131, 4), and the\nthree (verses), \'Blessing to us on the paths\' (Rig-veda X, 63, 15-17) (are to\nbe repeated before the recitation) of the Mahavrata (chapter).\n\n3\\. But (at that) of the _S_ akvari (verses) before (the formula mentioned in\nthe first Sara):\n\n4 4. The three T _ri_ _k_ as, \'To him, the thirsty one\' (Rig-veda VI, 42,\n1-3), \'The wealthiest (Soma), O wealthy one\' (VI, 44, 1-3), \'Him who does no\nharm to you\' (VI, 44, 4-6), (the verse), \'To him, to him the sap of the herb\'\n(VI, 42, 4), (and the verse), "Verily thou art a hero\' (VIII, 81, 28)\xc2\x97thus for\nthe _S_ akvari (verses) before and afterwards.\n\n5\\. Now for the Upanishad (texts)\xc2\x97\n\n6\\. The same (recitation) as for the Mahavrata.\n\n7 7. For the Sa _m_ hitas, however, before (the text given in the first Sutra\nthe formula has to be recited), \'I shall speak right, I shall speak truth\n(&c.)\'\xc2\x97this is the difference (in the case of the Sa _m_ hitas).\n\n8 8. Now for the Mantha the two verses (have to be recited) before (the\nformula given in the first Sutra), \'This we entreat of Savitar,\' \'That\nglorious (splendour) of Savitar\' (Rig-veda V, 82, 1; III, 62, 10).\n\np. 147\n\n9\\. With (the formula), \'Unerring mind\' (see Sutra 1), then follow the\nexpiatory formulas that belong to the (different) sections.\n\n10\\. (All) this on one day.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[145:1](sbe29096.htm#fr_337) 4, 1. The formula \'Adabdha _m_ mana _h_ ,\' &c.\nhas to be recited before each of the single \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka texts (the _S_ akvari\nverses, the Mahavrata, &c.); to this formula are added, before or after it, as\nthe case may be, other texts specified in the Sutras 2-8. Of these there can\nbe no doubt about the meaning of Sutras 7, 8, treating of the introductory\nformulas of the Sa _m_ hita section (Kaush. \xc3\x82r. VII-VIII) and of the Mantha\nsection (ibid. IX): before the text adabdham, &c. are to be added, in the\nfirst case the formula _ri_ ta _m_ vadishyami, &c., in the second case two\n_Ri_ _k_ as addressed to Savit _ri_. These formulas and verses have been\nreceived into the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka text and are found there in the order here\nstated, at the beginning of books VII and IX. The meaning of the words sa _m_\nhitana _m_ tu purvam (Sutra 7) having thus been established, I can see no\nreason why we should not interpret the words _s_ akvari _n_ a _m_ to purvam\n(Sutra 3) quite in the same way. Thus the introductory benediction for the\nrecital of the _S_ akvari verses would consist, firstly of the verses stated\nin Sutra 4, then of the formula adabdham, &c.; those verses would have to be\nrepeated again after the _S_ akvari verses (end of Sutra 4). The recitation of\nthe Mahavrata (Sutras 1, 2) and of the Upanishads (Sutra 5) is preceded by\nadabdham, &c., and then by the four verses stated in Sutra 2. The\ninterpretation which Naraya _n_ a gives of this Sutra is not quite the same as\nthat which I have here proposed; see p. 163 of the German edition.\n\n[146:4](sbe29096.htm#fr_338) According to the reading of some MSS. we should\nhave to translate, or (the verse), \'Verily,\' &c.\n\n[146:7](sbe29096.htm#fr_339) On the Sa _m_ hitas (Kaush. \xc3\x82r. VII, VIII) see\nMax Muller, Rig-veda Prati _s_ akhya, pp. 4 seq.; Ait. \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka III (pp.\n305 seqq., ed. Bibl.
