Haradatta remarks that the father is\nmentioned here, in order to indicate that other less venerable relatives must\ncertainly p. 278 also be abandoned. He also states that bhru _n_ ahan, \'he who\nslays a learned Brahma _n_ a,\' includes sinners who have committed other\nmortal sins (mahapataka), see XXI, 1.\n\n[278:2](sbe0284.htm#fr_1370) Manu XI, 183-185; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 295.\nThe spiritual Gurus, i.e. the teacher who initiated him (a _k_ arya) and those\nwho instructed him in the Veda (upadhyaya).\n\n[278:8](sbe0284.htm#fr_1371) Manu XI, 185.\n\n[279:10](sbe0284.htm#fr_1372) Manu XI, 187-188; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 296.\n\n[279:11](sbe0284.htm#fr_1373) As appears from Gobhila G _ri_ hya-sutra III, 4,\n16, the noun to be understood is apam a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali _h_ , \'a handful of\nwater.\'\n\n[279:15](sbe0284.htm#fr_1374) Haradatta refers the term Pavamanis here to\nTaittiriya-brahma _n_ a I, 4, 8.
