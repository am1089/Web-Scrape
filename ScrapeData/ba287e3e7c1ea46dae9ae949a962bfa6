But on account of (scripture teaching) the additional one (i.e. the Lord),\n(the view) of Badaraya _n_ a (is valid); as that is seen thus (in scriptural\npassages).\n\nThe word 'but' discards the purvapaksha.--The assertion made in Sutra 2 cannot\nbe maintained 'on account of the text teaching the additional one.' If the\nVedanta-texts taught that the transmigrating embodied Self which is an agent\nand enjoyer is something different from the mere body, the statements as to\nthe fruit of the knowledge of the Self would, for the reasons indicated above,\nbe mere arthavadas. But what the Vedanta-texts really teach as the object of\nknowledge is something different from the embodied Self, viz. the non-\ntransmigrating Lord who is free from all attributes of transmigratory\nexistence such as agency and the like and distinguished by freedom from sin\nand so on, the highest Self. And the knowledge of that Self does not only not\npromote action but rather cuts all action short, as will be declared in Sutra\n16. Hence the view of the reverend Badaraya _n_ a which was stated in Sutra 1\nremains valid and cannot be shaken by fallacious reasoning about the\nsubordination of knowledge to action and the like. That the Lord who is\nsuperior to the embodied Self is the Self many scriptural texts declare;\ncompare 'He who perceives all and knows all' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9); 'From terror\nof it the wind blows, from terror the sun rises' (Taitt. Up. II, 8); 'It is a\ngreat terror, a raised thunderbolt' (Ka. Up. II, 6, 2); 'By the command of\nthat imperishable one, O Gargi' (B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 9); 'It thought, may I be\nmany, may I grow forth. It sent forth fire' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 3). There are\nindeed passages in\n\np. 291\n\nwhich the transmigrating Self--hinted at by such terms as 'dear'--is referred\nto as the object of knowledge, such as 'But for the love of the Self\neverything is dear. Verily the Self is to be seen' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 5); 'He\nwho breathes in the up-breathing he is thy Self and within all' (B _ri_. Up.\nIII, 4, i); 'The person that is seen in the eye that is thy Self,' up to 'But\nI shall explain him further to you' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7 ff). But as there are\nat the same time complementary passages connected with the passages quoted\nabove--viz. 'There has been breathed forth from this great Being the _Ri_\ng-veda., Ya _g_ ur-veda,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 10); 'He who overcomes\nhunger and thirst, sorrow, passion, old age and death' (B _ri_. Up. III, 5,\ni); 'Having approached the highest light he appears in his own form. That is\nthe highest person' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 3)--which aim at giving instruction\nabout the superior Self; it follows that the two sets of passages do not mean\nto teach an absolute difference of the two Selfs and that thus contradiction\nis avoided. For the Self of the highest Lord is the real nature of the\nembodied Self, while the state of being embodied is due to the limiting\nadjuncts, as appears from scriptural passages such as 'Thou art that;' 'There\nis no other seer but he.' All which has been demonstrated by us at length in\nthe earlier parts of this commentary in more than one place.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 9](sbe38218.htm)\n\n"
