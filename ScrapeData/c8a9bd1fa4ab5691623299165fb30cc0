And thus there would be accomplishment on the part of non-active people\nalso.\n\nThus, i.e. on the theory of universal momentariness, origination from the non-\nexistent, causeless cognition, and so on, it would follow that persons also\nnot making any efforts may accomplish all their ends. It is a fact that the\nattainment of things desired and the warding off of things not desired is\neffected through effort, and so on. But if all existences momentarily perish,\na previously existing thing, or special attributes of it, such as after-\neffects (through which Svarga and the like are effected) or knowledge (through\nwhich Release is effected) do not persist, and hence nothing whatever can be\naccomplished by effort. And as thus all effects would be accomplished without\na cause, even perfectly inert men would accomplish all the ends to be reached\nin this and in the next life, including final release. Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'the aggregates.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 27. Not non-existence, on account of consciousness](sbe48231.htm)\n\n"
