Thus in other cases also, on account of the connexion (of particulars\nwith one and the same vidya).\n\nWe read in the B _ri_ had-ara _n_ yaka (V, 5), 'The true is Brahman,' and,\nfurther on, 'Now what is the true, that is the \xc3\x82ditya, the person that dwells\nin yonder orb, and the person in the right eye.' Having thus declared the\ndifferent abodes of that true Brahman with reference to the gods and with\nreference to the body, and having, in what follows, identified its body with\nthe sacred syllables (bhu _h_ , &c.), the text teaches its two secret names\n(upanishad), 'Its secret name is ahar' with reference to the gods; and 'its\nsecret name is aham' with reference to the body.--A doubt here arises whether\nthese two secret names are both to be applied to the deva-abode of Brahman as\nwell as to its bodily abode, or only one name to each.\n\nThe above Sutra maintains the purvapaksha view. Just as certain particulars\nthough recorded elsewhere are yet\n\np. 217\n\nto be combined with the Sa _n_ _d_ ilya-vidya, so we have to proceed in other\ncases also, as e.g. the one under discussion, because the particulars\nmentioned are all connected with one vidya. The vidya of the True with its\ndouble reference to the Devas and to the body is one only, as we infer from\nthe fact of its having one exordium only ('The true is Brahman'), and from the\nway in which the text interconnects \xc3\x82ditya and the person in the eye. Why then\nshould an attribute belonging to one of the latter not belong to the other\nalso? For, to quote an analogous case, certain rules of life which are\nprescribed for a teacher--as e.g. having a following of pupils--remain equally\nvalid whether the teacher be in a village or in a wood. For these reasons both\nsecret names equally belong to the \xc3\x82ditya as well as to the person within the\neye. This view the next Sutra refutes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 21](sbe38164.htm)\n\n"
