The mists gather, that is the hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara; the cloud has risen, that is the\nprastava; it rains, that is the udgitha; it flashes and thunders, that is the\npratihara; it stops, that is the nidhana. That is the Vairupa Saman, as\ninterwoven in Par _g_ anya, the god of rain.\n\n2\\. He who thus knows the Vairupa as interwoven in Par _g_ anya, obtains all\nkinds of cattle (virupa), he reaches the full life, he lives long, becomes\ngreat with children and cattle, great by fame. His rule is, 'Never complain of\nthe rain.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 16](sbe01050.htm)\n\n"
