Then _G_ aratkarava \xc3\x82rtabhaga 2 asked. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,' he said, 'how\nmany Grahas are there, and how many Atigrahas 3?'\n\n'Eight Grahas,' he replied,' and eight Atigrahas.'\n\n'And what are these eight Grahas and eight Atigrahas?'\n\n2\\. 'Pra _n_ a (breath) is one Graha, and that is seized by Apana (down-\nbreathing) as the Atigraha 4, for one smells with the Apana.'\n\n3\\. 'Speech (va _k_ ) is one Graha, and that is seized by name (naman) as the\nAtigraha, for with speech one pronounces names.\n\n4\\. 'The tongue is one Graha, and that is seized by taste as the Atigraha, for\nwith the tongue one perceives tastes.'\n\n5\\. 'The eye is one Graha, and that is seized by form as the Atigraha, for\nwith the eye one sees forms.'\n\n6\\. 'The ear is one Graha, and that is seized by sound as the Atigraha, for\nwith the ear one hears sounds.'\n\n7\\. 'The mind is one Graha, and that is seized by\n\np. 126\n\ndesire as the Atigraha, for with the mind one desires desires.'\n\n8\\. 'The arms are one Graha, and these are seized by work as the Atigraha, for\nwith the arms one works work.'\n\n9\\. 'The skin is one Graha, and that is seized by touch as the Atigraha, for\nwith the skin one perceives touch. These are the eight Grahas and the eight\nAtigrahas.'\n\n10\\. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,' he said, 'everything is the food of death. What\nthen is the deity to whom death is food?'\n\n'Fire (agni) is death, and that is the food of water. Death is conquered\nagain.'\n\n11\\. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,' he said, 'when such a person (a sage) dies, do the\nvital breaths (pra _n_ as) move out of him or no?'\n\n'No,' replied Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya; 'they are gathered up in him, he swells, he\nis inflated, and thus inflated the dead lies at rest.'\n\n12\\. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,' he said, 'when such a man dies, what does not leave\nhim?'\n\n'The name,' he replied; 'for the name is endless, the Vi _s_ vedevas are\nendless, and by it he gains the endless world.'\n\n13\\. 'Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya,' he said,' when the speech of this dead person\nenters into the fire 1, breath into the air, the eye into the sun, the mind\ninto the moon, the hearing into space, into the earth the body, into the ether\nthe self, into the shrubs the hairs of the body, into the trees the hairs of\nthe head, when the\n\np. 127\n\nblood and the seed are deposited in the water, where is then that person?'\n\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said: 'Take my hand, my friend. We two alone shall know of\nthis; let this question of ours not be (discussed) in public.' Then these two\nwent out and argued, and what they said was karman (work), what they praised\nwas karman 1, viz. that a man becomes good by good work, and bad by bad work.\nAfter that _G_ aratkarava \xc3\x82rtabhaga held his peace.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[125:1](sbe15065.htm#fr_391) Madhyandina text, p. 1069.\n\n[125:2](sbe15065.htm#fr_392) A descendant of _Ri_ tabhaga of the family of _G_\naratkaru.\n\n[125:3](sbe15065.htm#fr_393) Graha is probably meant originally in its usual\nsacrificial sense, as a vessel for offering oblations. But its secondary\nmeaning, in which it is here taken, is a taker, a grasper, i.e. an organ of\nsense, while atigraha is intended for that which is grasped, i.e. an object of\nsense.\n\n[125:4](sbe15065.htm#fr_394) Here the a is long, _kh_ andasatvat.\n\n[126:1](sbe15065.htm#fr_395) The commentator explains purusha here by\nasamyagdar _s_ in, one who does not know the whole truth. See also Deussen,\nVedanta, p. 405, and p. 399, note.\n\n[127:1](sbe15065.htm#fr_396) What is intended is that the sa _m_ sara\ncontinues by means of karman, while karman by itself never leads to moksha.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3](sbe15066.htm)\n\n"
