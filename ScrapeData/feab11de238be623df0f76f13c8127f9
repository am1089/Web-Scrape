For once upon a time the sacrifice escaped the gods, and having\nbecome a black antelope roamed about. The gods having thereupon found it and\nstripped it of its skin, they brought it (the skin) away with them.\n\np. 24\n\n1:1:4:22\\. Its white and black hairs represent the _Ri_ _k_ -verses and the\nSaman-verses; to wit, the white the Saman and the black the _Ri_ _k_ ; or\nconversely, the black the Saman and the white the _Ri_ _k_. The brown and the\nyellow ones, on the other hand, represent the Ya _g_ us-texts.\n\n1:1:4:33\\. Now this same threefold science is the sacrifice; that manifold\nform, that (varying) colour of this (science) is what is (represented by) this\nblack antelope skin. For the completeness of the sacrifice (he takes the\nskin): hence the rite of initiation (for the Soma-sacrifice) is likewise\nperformed on the black antelope skin;--for the completion of the sacrifice:\nhence it is also used for husking and bruising (the rice) on, in order that\nnothing of the oblation may get spilt; and that, if any grain or flour should\nnow be spilt on it, the sacrifice would still remain securely established in\nthe sacrifice. For this reason it is used for husking and bruising upon.\n\n1:1:4:44\\. He thus takes the black antelope skin, with the text (Va _g_. S: I,\n14 a): \'Bliss-bestowing ( _s_ arman) art thou!\' For _k_ arman (\'hide\') is the\nname of that (skin of the) black deer used among men, but _s_ arman (bliss) is\n(that used) among the gods; and for this reason he says, \'Bliss-bestowing art\nthou!\' He shakes it, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 14 b), \'Shaken off is the\nRakshas, shaken off are the enemies!\' whereby he repels from it the evil\nspirits, the Rakshas. He shakes it whilst holding it apart from the vessels 1;\nwhereby he shakes off whatever impure matter there may have been on it.\n\np. 25\n\n1:1:4:55\\. He spreads it (on the ground with the hairy side upwards, and) with\nits neck-part turned to the west 1, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 14 c): \'The\nskin of Aditi art thou! May Aditi acknowledge thee!\' For Aditi is this earth,\nand whatever is on her, that serves as a skin to her: for this reason he says,\n\'The skin of Aditi art thou!\' And \'may Aditi acknowledge thee!\' he says,\nbecause one who is related (to another) acknowledges (him). Thereby he\nestablishes a mutual understanding between her and the black antelope skin,\n(thinking) \'they will not hurt each other.\' While it is still being held down\nwith his left hand,--\n\n1:1:4:66\\. He at once takes the mortar with his right hand, fearing lest the\nevil spirits, the Rakshas, might rush in here in the meantime. For the priest\n(brahma _n_ a) 2 is the repeller of the Rakshas: therefore, whilst it is still\nbeing held down with his left hand,--\n\n1:1:4:77\\. He puts the mortar (on it), with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 14 d, e):\n\'A wooden stone (adri) art thou!\'\n\np. 26\n\nor \'A broad-bottomed stone (gravan) art thou!\' For, just as there (in the\nSoma-sacrifice) they press king Soma out with stones (gravan), thus here also\nhe prepares the oblation (havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a) by means of the mortar and\npestle, and the large and small mill-stones 1. Now \'stones (adraya _h_ )\' is\nthe common name of these, and therefore he says, \'a stone art thou.\' And\n\'wooden,\' he calls it, because this one (the mortar) really is made of wood 2.\nOr, he says, \'a broad-bottomed stone (gravan) art thou,\' because it is both a\nstone and broad-bottomed. He adds: \'May Aditi\'s skin acknowledge (receive)\nthee!\' whereby he establishes a mutual understanding between it (the mortar)\nand the black antelope skin, thinking: \'they will not injure each other.\'\n\n1:1:4:88\\. He then pours the (two portions of) rice (from the winnowing basket\ninto the mortar), with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 15 a): \'Thou art the body of\nAgni, thou the releaser of speech!\' For it is (material for) sacrifice, and\nhence (by being offered in the fire) it becomes Agni\'s body. \'The releaser of\nspeech,\' he adds, because he now releases that speech which he restrained when\nhe was about to take the rice (from the cart). The reason why he now releases\nhis speech, is that the sacrifice has now obtained a firm footing in the\nmortar, that it has become diffused; and for this reason he says, \'the\nreleaser of speech!\'\n\np. 27\n\n1:1:4:99\\. Should he, however (by some accident), utter any human sound before\nthis time, let him in that case mutter some _Ri_ _k_ or Ya _g_ us-text\naddressed to Vish _n_ u 1; for Vish _n_ u is the sacrifice, so that he thereby\nagain obtains a hold on the sacrifice, and penance is thereby done by him (for\nnot keeping silent). He adds: \'For the pleasure of the gods I seize thee!\' for\nthe oblation is taken with the intention \'that it shall gladden the gods.\'\n\n1:1:4:1010\\. He now takes the pestle, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 14 b), \'A\nlarge, wooden stone art thou!\' for it is a large stone, and made of wood, too.\nHe thrusts it down, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 14 c), \'Do thou prepare this\noblation for the gods 2! do thou prepare it thoroughly!\' thereby saying, \'Get\nthis oblation ready for the gods! get it quite ready!\'\n\n1:1:4:1111\\. He then calls the Havishk _ri_ t 3 (preparer of the sacrificial\nfood), \'Havishk _ri_ t, come hither! Havishk _ri_ t, come hither!\' The Havishk\n_ri_ t 4 no doubt is speech, so that he thereby frees speech from\n\np. 28\n\nrestraint. And speech, moreover, represents sacrifice 1, so that he thereby\nagain calls the sacrifice to him.\n\n1:1:4:1212\\. Now there are four different forms of this call, viz. \'come\nhither (ehi)!\' in the case of a Brahman; \'approach (agahi)!\' and \'hasten\nhither (adrava)!\' in the case of a Vai _s_ ya and a member of the military\ncaste (ra _g_ anyabandhu 2); and \'run hither (adhava)!\' in that of a _S_ udra.\nOn this occasion he uses the call that belongs to a Brahman, because that one\nis best adapted for a sacrifice, and is besides the most gentle:. let him\ntherefore say, \'come hither (ehi)!\'\n\n1:1:4:1313\\. Now in former times it was no other than the wife (of the\nsacrificer) who rose at this (call, to act) as Havishk _ri_ t; therefore now\nalso (she or) some one (priest) 3 rises in answer to this call. And at the\ntime when he (the Adhvaryu) calls the Havishk _ri_ t, one of the priests 4\nbeats the two mill-stones.\n\np. 29\n\n[paragraph continues] The reason why they produce this discordant noise, is\nthis:\n\n1:1:4:1414\\. Manu was in possession of a bull 1. Into him had entered an\nAsura-killing, foe-killing voice; and by his snorting and roaring the Asuras\nand Rakshas were continually being crushed. Thereupon the Asuras said to one\nanother: \'Evil, alas! this bull inflicts upon us! how can we possibly destroy\nhim?\' Now Kilata and \xc3\x82kuli were the two priests (brahman) of the Asuras.\n\n1:1:4:1515\\. These two said, \'God-fearing, they say, is Manu: let us two then\nascertain!\' They then went to him and said: \'Manu! we will sacrifice for\nthee!\' He said: \'Wherewith?\' They said: \'With this bull!\' He said: \'So be it!\'\nOn his (the bull\'s) being killed the voice went from him.\n\n1:1:4:1616\\. It entered into Manavi, the wife of Manu; and when they heard her\nspeak, the Asuras and Rakshas were continually being crushed. Thereupon the\nAsuras said to one another: \'Hereby even greater evil is inflicted on us, for\nthe human voice speaks more!\' Kilata and \xc3\x82kuli then said: \'God-fearing, they\nsay, is Manu: let us then ascertain!\' They went to him and said: \'Manu! we\nwill sacrifice for thee!\' He said: \'Wherewith?\'\n\np. 30\n\n[paragraph continues] They said: \'With this thy wife!\' He said: \'So be it!\'\nAnd on her being killed that voice went from her.\n\n1:1:4:1717\\. It entered into the sacrifice itself, into the sacrificial\nvessels; and thence those two (Asura priests) were unable to expel it. This\nsame Asura-killing, foe-killing voice sounds forth (from the millstones when\nthey are beaten with the wedge). And for whomsoever that knows this, they\nproduce this discordant noise on the present occasion, his enemies are\nrendered very miserable.\n\n1:1:4:1818\\. He beats the mill-stones with the wedge, with the text (Va _g_.\nS. I, 16 a): \'A honey-tongued cock (kukku _t_ a 1) art thou (O wedge)!\' For\nhoney-tongued indeed was he (the bull) for the gods, and poison-tongued for\nthe Asuras: hence he thereby says: \'What thou wert for the gods, that be thou\nfor us!\' He adds: \'Sap and strength do thou call hither! with thy help may we\nconquer in every battle!\' In these words there is nothing that is obscure.\n\n1:1:4:1919\\. Thereupon 2 he (the Adhvaryu) takes the winnowing basket, with\nthe text (Va _g_. S. I, 14 b): \'Rain-grown art thou!\' For rain-grown it is\nindeed, whether it be made of reeds or of cane or of rushes, since it is the\nrain that makes these grow.\n\np. 31\n\n1:1:4:2020\\. He then pours out the (threshed) rice (from the mortar into the\nwinnowing basket), with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 16 c): \'May the rain-grown\nacknowledge (receive) thee!\' For rain-grown also are these (grains), whether\nthey be rice or barley, since it is the rain that makes them grow. By these\nwords he establishes an understanding between them and the winnowing basket,\nin the hope \'that they will not injure each other.\'\n\n1:1:4:2121\\. He now winnows (the rice), with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 16 d):\n\'Cleared off is the Rakshas! cleared off are the evil-doers!\' The husks (which\nhave fallen on the ground) he throws away 1, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 16\ne), \'Expelled is the Rakshas!\' for those evil spirits, the Rakshas, he thereby\nexpels.\n\n1:1:4:2222\\. He then separates (the husked grains from the unhusked), with the\ntext (Va _g_. S. I, 16 f): \'May the wind separate you!\' For it is that wind\n(which is produced by the winnowing) which here purifies (or blows, pavate);\nand it is the wind that separates everything here (on earth) that undergoes\nseparation: therefore it also separates here those (two kinds of grain) from\neach other. Now when they are undergoing this process, and whilst he is\nseparating 2 (the husked, so as to drop them into a pot),--\n\np. 32\n\n1:1:4:2323\\. He addresses (those in the pot) thus (Va _g_. S. I, 16 g): \'May\nthe divine Savit _ri_ , the golden-handed, receive you with a flawless 1\nhand!\' By this he says: \'May they be well received!\' He then cleans them\nthrice 2; for threefold is the sacrifice.\n\n1:1:4:2424\\. Here now some clean them with the formula: \'For the gods get\nclean! for the gods get clean!\' But let him not do so: for this oblation is\nintended for some particular deity; and if he were to say, \'For the gods get\nclean!\' he would make it one intended for all the deities, and would thereby\nraise a quarrel among the deities. Let him therefore do the cleaning silently!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[23:1](sbe1205.htm#fr_120) After he has done the sprinkling, he puts the\nremaining water away in some place where nobody is allowed to walk [as between\nthe pra _n_ itas and the \xc3\x82havaniya; or (according to \xc3\x82pastamba) before, or\neast of, the Garhapatya, since nobody is allowed to pass between the\nGarhapatya and \xc3\x82havaniya. The two strainers also remain in the sprinkling\nwater]. Katy. _S_ r. II, 3, 40.\n\n[23:2](sbe1206.htm#fr_121) The skin of the black antelope may be regarded as\none of the symbols of Brahmanical worship and civilisation. Thus it is said in\nManu II, 22-23: \'That which lies between these two mountain ranges (the\nHimalaya and the Vindhya), from the eastern to the western ocean, the wise\nknow as \xc3\x82ryavarta (the land of the \xc3\x82ryas). Where the black antelope naturally\nroams about, that should be known as the land suitable for sacrifice; what\nlies beyond that is the country of the Mle _k_ _kh_ as (barbarians).\'\n\n[24:1](sbe1206.htm#fr_122) According to some exegetes the Adhvaryu himself\nmust step beyond (i.e. aside from) the vessels when he shakes the skin;\naccording to others, he should not move, but only hold the skin p. 25 apart\nfrom the vessels, so that no impure matter should fall on them. Some also\nmaintain that the skin should only be shaken once, whilst others think it\nshould be done three times. Cf. Katy. _S_ r. II, 4, 2. Schol.\n\n[25:1](sbe1206.htm#fr_123) Special mention is here made of this feature, since\nas a rule (Katy. I, 10, 4) the skin is spread with its neck-part turned\neastwards. He lays it down on the north side of the sacrificial ground, either\nwest of the utkara (the mound formed by the earth dug out in constructing the\naltar, and by other rubbish) or exactly north of the Garhapatya. Schol. on\nKaty. II, 4, 3.\n\n[25:2](sbe1206.htm#fr_124) Only a Brahman can perform sacrifice. If, as is\npermitted in certain ceremonies, a Kshatriya or Vai _s_ ya officiates, he, as\nit were, becomes a Brahman (and is addressed as such) for the occasion, by\nmeans of the diksha, or rite of initiation. Cf. _S_ at. Br. III, 2, I, 39;\nXIII, 4, 1, 3.\n\n[26:1](sbe1206.htm#fr_125) Here, as in I, 5, 2, 11 (havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ e \'tha\nsaumye \'dhvare), we have the simple division of the Srauta-sacrifices into\noblations (of ghee, milk, rice, barley, &c.) and libations (of Soma). More\nusually the pa _s_ ubandhu, or animal-sacrifice, is added as a third division.\nSee also I, 7, 2, 10.\n\n[26:2](sbe1206.htm#fr_126) The mortar (ulukhala) and pestle (musala) are to be\nmade of very hard wood, viz. both of vara _n_ a wood (Crataega Roxburghii), or\nthe mortar of pala _s_ a wood (Butea Frondosa), and the pestle of p. 27\nkhadira wood (Acacia Catechu). The former is to be of the height of the knee,\nand the latter three aratnis (cubits) long. Schol. on Katy. I, 3, 36; M.\nMuller, Die Todtenbestattung bei den Brahmanen, Zeitsch. der D. Morg. Ges. IX,\np. xl.\n\n[27:1](sbe1206.htm#fr_127) Katy. _S_ r. II, 2, 6-7 lays down the general rule,\nthat if the Brahman or Adhvaryu (and according to some, the sacrificer also)\nby some slip were to utter any sound during the time for which restraint of\nspeech (vag-yama) is enjoined, they must atone for the transgression by\nmuttering some mantra addressed to Vish _n_ u, such as the couplet (Va _g_. S.\nV, 38, 45), \'Widely, O Vish _n_ u, stride!\' &c., or the formula (ib. I, 4), \'O\nVish _n_ u, preserve the sacrifice!\'\n\n[27:2](sbe1206.htm#fr_128) Or \'for the god,\' \'for the goddess,\' as the case\nmay be.\n\n[27:3](sbe1206.htm#fr_129) Or, he pronounces the havishk _ri_ t formula, see\nnext note. According to Katy. _S_ r. II, 4, 13 he calls out three separate\ntimes.\n\n[27:4](sbe1206.htm#fr_130) Havishk _ri_ t denotes not only the person that\nprepares the oblation, but also this formula by which that person is called.\n\n[28:1](sbe1206.htm#fr_131) Viz. in the shape of the sacrificial formulas.\n\n[28:2](sbe1206.htm#fr_132) This inversion of the order of the second (or\nKshatriya) and third (or Vai _s_ ya) castes is rather strange. The Sutras of\nBharadv., \xc3\x82past., and Hira _n_ y. assign the same formulas to the several\ncastes as here. Cf. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. 29.\n\n[28:3](sbe1206.htm#fr_133) According to the Schol. on Katy. _S_ r. II, 4, 13,\neither the wife of the patron or the \xc3\x82gnidhra (the priest who kindles the\nfire) acts as Havishk _ri_ t. Mahidh. on Va _g_. S. I, 15 includes the patron\n(sacrificer) himself, unless ya _g_ amana _h_ patni is a misprint for ya _g_\namanapatni. According to \xc3\x82pastamba, \'either a maidservant or the wife grinds;\nor the wife threshes and the _S_ udra woman grinds\' (cf. Schol. on Katy. _S_\nr. II, 5, 7). Similarly Bharadv. and Hira _n_ y.; cf. Hillebrandt, p. 38, n.\n2. Similar cases of differences between the ritualistic practices of the\npresent time and those of former times are very frequently alluded to in the\nritualistic books; and are of especial interest, as they afford some insight\ninto the gradual development of the sacrificial ceremonial. Cf. Weber, Ind.\nStud. X, 156 seq.\n\n[28:4](sbe1206.htm#fr_134) Viz. the \xc3\x82gnidhra, whilst seated north of the\nexpansion p. 29 (vihara) of the fires; he strikes with the wedge ( _s_ amya, a\nstick of khadira wood, usually some six or eight inches long, used for placing\nunder the lower grindstone on the north side, so as to make it incline towards\neast) twice the lower and once the upper grindstone. Schol. on Katy. _S_ r.\nII, 4, 15.\n\n[29:1](sbe1206.htm#fr_135) This bull of Manu has been compared by Dr. Kuhn\n(Zeitschrift fur Vergl. Sprachf. IV, 91 seq.) with the Minotaur of the Greeks.\nCf. also J. Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, vol. i. p. 188 seq.; and Professor\nWeber\'s Translation of the first Adhyaya, Ind. Streifen, I, p. 50.\n\n[30:1](sbe1206.htm#fr_136) Mahidhara offers the following etymological\nderivation of this word: 1. from kva kva, \'where? where?\' [\'He who, wishing to\nkill the Asuras, roams about everywhere, crying "where, where are the\nAsuras?"\']; 2. from kuk, \'a hideous noise,\' and ku _t_ , \'to spread;\' or 3.\none who, in order to frighten the Asuras, utters a sound resembling that of\nthe bird called kukku _t_ a (cock). Professor Weber translates it by \'Bruller\'\n(roarer, crier).\n\n[30:2](sbe1206.htm#fr_137) Viz. when the rice has been husked (by the Havishk\n_ri_ t in the mortar). Schol. on Katy. Sr. II, 4, 16.\n\n[31:1](sbe1206.htm#fr_138) He puts them into the central one of the potsherds\nfor the Agni cake, and throws them on the utkara, or heap of rubbish (cf. p.\n25, note 1). Schol. on Katy. _S_ r. II, 4, 19. Before he proceeds with his\nwork, he has to touch water; cf. p. 2, note 2.\n\n[31:2](sbe1206.htm#fr_139) He separates them whilst holding the mouth of the\nwinnowing basket sideways or horizontally, and makes the husked ones fall into\nthe pot. Schol. on Katy. _S_ r. II, 4, 20. According to the Paddhati, he now\nputs the unhusked once more into the mortar and threshes them again, and then\npouring them back into the basket repeats the same process.\n\n[32:1](sbe1206.htm#fr_140) Viz. with the fingers joined together so as not to\nallow any grains to fall to the ground. Mahidh.\n\n[32:2](sbe1206.htm#fr_141) By removing the minute husks and grains (ka _n_ a)\nhe makes the husked grains (ta _n_ _d_ ula) free from dust and shiny (this is\napparently done by repeated winnowings). Schol. on Katy. Sr. II, 4, 22.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 1. Second Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe1207.htm)\n\n'
