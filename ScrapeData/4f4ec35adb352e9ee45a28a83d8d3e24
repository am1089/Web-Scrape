Actively occupied as a guide\nto many of its departments, and carrying on a peripatetic interpretation of\nthem upon lines of regional and occupational evolution, broadly akin to those\nof Le Play and his disciples, I found no one who so rapidly and ardently\nseized upon the principle and delighted in every application of it as Sister\nNivedita.\n\nEager to master these evolutionary methods, and to apply them to her own\nstudies, to Indian problems therefore above all, she settled above our home\ninto an attic cell, which suited at once her love of wide and lofty outlooks\nand her ascetic care of material simplicity; and there she worked, for\nstrenuous weeks. She has generously recognised, at the opening of _The Web of\nIndian Life_ , how\n\np. xxxii\n\nthus coming "to understand a little of Europe," she had been given indirectly\na method by which to interpret her Indian experiences--while for my part I\nmust no less recognise how her keener vision and more sympathetic and\nspiritual insight carried her discernment of the rich and varied embroidery of\nthe Indian web far beyond that simple texture of the underlying canvas, of the\nmaterial conditions of life, which it was my privilege at the outset of our\nmany conversations to help her to lay hold upon.\n\n\n\nThe whole personality of Nivedita--her face, her voice, her changing moods and\ndaily life, were ever expressing the alternating reaction of outward\nenvironment and inward spirit which goes on throughout the individual and\nsocial life. She was open at once to the concrete and the abstract, to the\nscientific and the philosophic, and her many moods were in perpetual interplay\n--sparkling with keen observation, with humorous or poetic interpretation, or,\nopal-like, suffused with mystic light, aflame with moral fire. All came out in\nher talks, her occasional lectures--each a striking improvisation--now in\ngentlest persuasiveness leading her audience into sympathetic understanding,\nor even approval, of some aspect or feature of Indian life, unknown or perhaps\nrepellent before; or again, bursting into indignant\n\np. xxxiii\n\nflash and veritable thunder upon our complacent and supercilious British\nphilistinism.\n\nWith children she was at once a born teacher and a skilled. She would sit with\nthem upon the floor in the firelight and tell them her _Cradle Tales of\nHinduism_ , with a power and charm even excelling her written version of them,\nso touching this or that ardent young soul to dream of following her to the\nutmost East. Or she might give them a literature lesson--say, on Shelley\'s\nSkylark--and here demand, and arouse, their observation and their imagination\nin touch with the poet\'s. This union of sense and symbol, which we too easily\nlet slip apart, was ever with her. Thus of our many memory portraits, none\ncomes back more vividly than of her in autumn twilight, now crooning, now\nchanting, the _Hymn to Agni_ over the glowing, dying embers of a garden-fire.\nStrange though the words were, we still hear the refrain. It was the tongue,\nthe music, of Orient in Occident, the expression of spirit in nature--a face,\na voice, aglow with energy, at peace with night.\n\nP. GEDDES.\n\n### MR. NEVINSON\n\nIt is as vain to describe Sister Nivedita in two pages as to reduce fire to a\nformula and call it knowledge. There was, indeed, something flame-like\n\np. xxxiv\n\nabout her, and not only her language but her whole vital personality often\nreminded me of fire. Like fire, and like Shiva, Kali, and other Indian powers\nof the spirit, she was at once destructive and creative, terrible and\nbeneficent. There was no dull tolerance about her, and I suppose no one ever\ncalled her gentle. Even with friends her disagreement could be vehement, and\nher contradiction was very direct. In face of the enemy her eyes turned to\nglowing steel, and under anger they deepened in colour, like Garibaldi\'s. Her\nscorn of presumptuous ignorance and her indignation at wrong were blasting. I\ndo not doubt that rage lacerated her own heart, but she withered the enemy up,\nNo one would call her gentle.\n\nBut of all nobly sympathetic natures she was among the finest. She identified\nherself with the Indians among whom she lived as barely half a dozen men or\nwomen from these islands have done before. I do not mean merely by her\nadoption of Hindu symbolism for thought, nor by her purified form of Hindu\nworship. To me, thought and religion are so much the outcome of physical\nnature, of nationality, and ancient association or descent, that it seems\nhardly possible for a foreigner, born outside those overwhelming influences,\nto make another people\'s thought and religion genuinely his own. Explicable,\nand\n\np. xxxv\n\neven reasonable, as her worship in the temple beside the Ganges was, it seemed\na little strained and exotic for one of our race--a little self-conscious and\nunreal, like an Englishman going about in the beautiful Indian dress. But her\nreadiness to accept and interpret what was clearest and highest in Hindu\nthought, her capacity not merely for understanding Indian life, but for\ndiscovering and so intensifying the ideal in its customs, and the indignant\nrevolt kindled in her by the insolence, degradation, and maiming restriction\nto which every subject race is necessarily exposed--from such imaginative\nsympathy, I think, arose the extraordinary power which she exercised over the\nmore thoughtful and active of the Indian patriots around her. I do not know\nwhether on the religious side it could be said of her, as of the philosopher,\nthat she was "drunk with God"; but on the side of daily life and political\nthought it might certainly be said that she was drunk with India.\n\nHer greatest book, _The Web of Indian Life_ , reveals the ideal of the Indian\nspirit with great beauty, and in it there is a passage which seems to\nillustrate the contrast between the ordinary Anglo-Indian woman\'s aspect of\nIndia and her own. She is saying how differently Niagara would have been\nregarded if it had been situated on the Ganges:\n\np. xxxvi\n\nInstead of fashionable picnics and railway pleasure-trips, the yearly or\nmonthly incursion of worshipping crowds. Instead of hotels, temples. Instead\nof ostentatious excess, austerity. Instead of the desire to harness its mighty\nforces to the chariot of human utility, the unrestrainable longing to throw\naway the body, and realise at once the ecstatic madness of Supreme Union.\n\nSpiritual as she was, here was no impracticable or dreamy spirit. Whether\nteaching in her little school among poor Indian streets of Calcutta, or\nstruggling against the famine and exploitation of Eastern Bengal, or awakening\nin young India the spirit which marked the growing consciousness of\nnationality, her eye was fixed not only on some eternal absorption in the\ninfinite, but on the eternal issues of the present moment here. We might say\nof her as has been said of the _Gita_ :\n\nThe book is really a battle-cry. Spirituality is with it no retreat from men\nand things, but a burning fire of knowledge that destroys bondage, consumes\nsluggishness and egoism, and penetrates everywhere. Not the withdrawn, but the\ntransfigured life, radiant with power and energy, triumphant in its\nselflessness, is religion.\n\nSister Nivedita always appeared to me to act on the _Gita\'s_ own stirring\nexhortation, "Holding gain and loss as one, prepare for battle." She herself\nwas thus always prepared. For a spirit like hers was not likely to meet with\nanything but battle in\n\np. xxxvii\n\nthis world, and it is as a soldier in the War of Liberation that I remember\nher--a soldier with a flaming sword.\n\nH. W. NEVINSON.\n\n### PROFESSOR CHEYNE, D.D., D.LITT., F.B.A.\n\nThe beautiful character of Sister Nivedita is well known to her friends, but\nneeds to be brought before outsiders, especially those of the younger\ngeneration. She was like a star, if we should not rather say, like a sun, and\nit would be sad if this sun should altogether set. Her place can hardly be\nfilled in the present aeon, though one or another may arise who may remind the\nwell-equipped historical student of her. Once in the last century, however,\nVivekananda and his disciple Nivedita have had their prototypes: I refer to\nthe saintly and heroic religious and social reformers known respectively as\nthe Bab and Kurratu\'l-\'Ayn ("Refreshment of the eyes"). The latter illustrious\npair lived and worked primarily for Persia, the former for India, but both had\na sense that their principles could only have adequate recognition when all\nnations accepted them as their standard of right. The Bab and "Her Highness\nthe Pure" were, however, much less modern than Vivekananda and Nivedita: it is\nBaha \'Ullah, and especially his son and successor Abdul Baha, who first in\nmodern times have consciously undertaken\n\np. xxxviii\n\nin a practical manner to blend the characteristic qualities of East and West.\n\nIt is the modernity of these Indian reformers which attracts. But then it must\nbe remembered that they come at the end of a long period which goes back as\nfar as Rammohun Roy. Nivedita, though "dedicated" to the service of India, and\nso far as was possible Hinduised, never ceased to keep in touch with Western\nthinkers and reformers: her visits to her earlier fatherland sufficiently\nprevented this. The intellectual department in which she was really a stranger\nwas the critical study of the Christian Scriptures; it was the reading of a\nsmall book of mine called _Bible Problems_ , and perhaps, I may add, the\nexample of a critic who was also a preacher of the Gospel, which I set, which\nrevealed to her the possibilities she had missed. And yet I do not question\nthat all is for the best. It was better that Nivedita and I should work\nindependently from different points of view, and in order that a larger point\nof view might emerge in the future. She was well aware that her teacher had\nnot himself reached the goal, and that West and East would have to join hands\nto pass the difficult region on the other side of which dwells Religious\nTruth. And I too am fully conscious of the deficiencies of my own stock of\nknowledge. It is to Sister Nivedita I owe it that these deficiencies are not\ngreater than they are.\n\np. xxxix\n\nAt this point I venture to quote what I have said elsewhere (in the _Modern\nReview_ , Calcutta, February 1912):\n\n"It was _The Web of Indian Life_ which brought us spiritually together. The\nbook fascinated me. I had never before seen India described from the inside. I\nwrote to her as warmly as I felt, at the same time drawing her attention to\nthe criticisms which some dryasdust professor had brought against her views of\nhistory. She replied in glowing terms, at the same time answering my inquiry\nas to the best sources of information for Hindu religion in its noblest form.\nShe pointed me to the _Bhagavad Gita_ and the lectures of the Swami\nVivekananda. This produced a revolution in my view of the capacity of Hindu\nreligion for adapting itself progressively to the spiritual needs of Indians,\nand for contributing elements of enormous value to the purification,\nenrichment, and reinterpretation of Christianity. . . . Sister Nivedita was\nwell aware that I looked for help to the Aryan East, and especially to her and\nher Master, and this may have been the chief reason why she paid me in the\ndazzling coin of affection, reverence, and gratitude for the sympathy which I\ndelighted to express to her."\n\nT. K. CHEYNE.\n\np. xl\n\n### MR. RABINDRANATH TAGORE\n\n[The following passages are translated from an appreciation of Sister Nivedita\ncontributed by Mr. Rabindranath Tagore, the poet of Bengal, to a vernacular\nmagazine soon after her death.]\n\nShe had a versatile, all-round genius, and with that there was another thing\nin her nature: that was her militancy. She had power, and she exerted that\npower with full force on the lives of others. A great enthusiasm to take\npossession of the mind after conquering it worked in her nature. . . . I have\nnot noticed in any other human being the wonderful power that was hers of\nabsolute dedication of herself. In her own personality there was nothing which\ncould stand in the way of this utter self-dedication. No bodily need,\nweakness, or craving; no European habit which had grown up from infancy; no\nfamily affection or tender tie of kinship; no slight received from her own\npeople; no indifference, weakness, and want of self-sacrifice on the part of\nthose for whom she had devoted her life, could turn her aside. He who has seen\nher has seen the essential form of man, the form of the spirit. It is a piece\nof great good fortune to be able to see how the inner being of man reveals\nitself with unobstructed and undiminished energy and effulgence, nullifying\nthe obstruction of all outer material coatings or\n\np. xli\n\nimpediments. We have been blessed in that we have witnessed that unconquered\nnobility of man in Sister Nivedita. . . . The life which Sister Nivedita gave\nfor us was a very great life. There was no defrauding of us on her part--that\nis, she gave herself up fully for the service of India; she did not keep\nanything back for her own use. Every moment of every day she gave whatever was\nbest in her, whatever was noblest. For this she underwent all the privation\nand austerity that is possible for man. Her resolve was this and this alone--\nthat she would give only that which was absolutely genuine; she would not mix\nself with it in the least;--no, not her hunger or thirst, profit or loss, name\nor fame; neither fear nor shrinking, nor ease nor rest. . . . She was in fact\na Mother of the People. We had not seen before an embodiment of the spirit of\nmotherhood which, passing beyond the limits of the family, can spread itself\nover the whole country. We have had some idea of the sense of duty of man in\nthis respect, but had not witnessed the wholehearted mother-love of women.\nWhen she uttered the words "Our People," the tone of absolute kinship which\nstruck the ear was not heard from any other among us. Whoever has seen what\nreality there was in her love of the people, has surely understood that we--\nwhile giving perhaps our time, our money, even our life--have not been\n\np. xlii\n\nable to give them our heart; we have not acquired the power to know the people\nas absolutely real and near. . . . The man who does not see the people, the\nnation, in every man, may say with his lips what he likes, but he does not see\nthe country properly. I have seen that Sister Nivedita _saw_ the common\npeople, _touched_ them, did not simply think of them mentally. The respect\nwith which she would greet some ordinary Mussulman woman dwelling in a hut in\na village is not possible for an ordinary individual; for the vision that\nenables one to see the greatness of humanity in humble individuals is a very\nuncommon gift. It was because this vision was so natural to her that she did\nnot lose her respect for India in spite of the nearness of her life to the\nlife of the people of India for so long a time.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Books by Sister Nivedita](seh05.htm)\n\n'
