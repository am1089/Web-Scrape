 \nOr frenzy's stroke my soul subdue?'  \nThus as he thought, his troubled mind  \nIn doubt and dread no rest could find,  \nDistressed and trembling like a deer  \nWho sees the dreaded tigress near.  \nOn the bare ground his limbs he thres,  \nAnd many a long sigh he drew,  \nLike a wild snake, with fury blind,  \nBy charms within a ring confined.  \nOnce as the monarch's fury woke,  \n'Shame on thee!' from his bosom broke,  \nAnd then in sense-bewildering pain  \nHe fainted on the ground again.  \nAt length, when slowly strength returned,  \nHe answered as his eyeballs burned  \nWith the wild fury of his ire  \nConsuming her, as 'twere, with fire:  \n'Fell traitress, thou whose thought design  \nThe utter ruin of my line,  \nWhat wrong have I or Rama done?  \nSpeak murderess, speak thou wicked one,  \nSeeks he not evermore to please  \nThee with all sonlike courtesies?  \nBy what persuasion art thou led  \nTo bring this ruin on his head?  \nAh me, that fondly unaware  \nI brought thee home my life to snare,  \nCalled daughter of a king, in truth  \nA serpent with a venomed tooth!  \nWhat fault can I pretend to find  \nIn Rama praised by all mankind,  \nThat I my darling should forsake?  \nNo, take my life, my glory take:  \nLet either queen be from me torn,  \nBut not my well-loved eldest-born,  \nHim but to see is highest bliss,  \nAnd death itself his face to miss.  \nThe world may sunless stand, the grain  \nMay thrive without the genial rain,  \nBut if my Rama be no nigh  \nMy spirit from its frame will fly.  \nEnough, thine impious plan forgo,  \nO thou who plottest sin and woe.  \nMy head before my feet, I kneel,  \nAnd pray thee some compassion feel,  \nO wicked dame, what can have led  \nThy heart to dare a plot so dread?  \nPerchance thy purpose is to sound  \nThe grace thy son with me has found;  \nPerchance the words that, all these days,  \nThou hast said in Rama's praise,  \nWere only feigned; designed to cheer  \nWith flatteries a father's ear.  \nSoon as thy grief, my Queen, I knew,  \nMy bosom felt the anguish too.  \nIn empty halls art thou posessed,  \nAnd subject to anothers' hest?  \nNow on Ikshvaku's ancient race  \nFalls foul disorder and disgrace,  \nIf thou, O Queen, whose heart so long  \nHas loved the good should choose the wrong  \nNot once, O large-eyed dame, hast thou  \nBeen guilty of offence till now,  \nNor said a word to make me grieve,  \nNor will I now thy sin believe.  \nWith thee my Rama used to hold  \nLike place with Bharat lofty-souled.  \nAs thou so ofthe, when the pair  \nWere children yet, wouldst fain declare.  \nAnd can thy righteous soul endure  \nThat Rama glorious, pious, pure,  \nShould to the distant wilds be sent  \nFor fourteen years of banishment?  \nYea, Rama Bharat's self exceeds  \nIn love to thee and sonlike deeds,  \nAnd, for deserving love of thee,  \nAs Bharat, even so is he.  \nWho better than that chieftain may  \nObedience, love, and honour pay,  \nThey dignity with care protect,  \nThy slightest word and wish respect?  \nOf all his countless followers none  \nCan breathe a word against my son;  \nOf many thousands not a dame  \nCan hint reproach or whisper blame.  \nAll creatures feel the sweet control  \nOf Rama's pure and gentle soul.  \nThe pride of Manu's race he binds  \nTo him the people's grateful minds.  \nHe wins the subjects with his truth,  \n\np. 104  \n\nThe poor with gifts and gentle ruth,  \nHis teachers with his docile will,  \nThe foemen with his archer skill.  \nTruth, purity, religious zeal,  \nThe hand to give, the heart to feel.  \nThe love that ne'er betrays a friend,  \nThe rectitude that naught can bend,  \nKnowledge, and meek obedience grace  \nMy Rama pride of Raghu's race.  \nCanst thou thine impious plot design  \n'Gainst him in whom these virtues shine,  \nWhose glory with the sages vies,  \nPeer of the Gods who rule the skies!  \nFrom him no harsh or bitter word  \nTo pain one creature have I heard,  \nAnd how can I my sin address,  \nFor thee, with words of bitterness?  \nHave mercy, Queen: some pity show  \nTo see my tears of anguish now,  \nAnd listen to my mournful cry,  \nA poor old man who soon must die.  \nWhate'er this sea-girt land can boast  \nOf rich and rare from coast to coast,  \nTo thee, my Queen, I give it all:  \nBut O, thy deadly words recall:  \nO see, my suppliant hands entreat,  \nAgain my lips are on thy feet:  \nSave Rama, save my darling child,  \nNor kill me with this sin defiled.'  \nHe grovelled on the ground, and lay  \nTo burning grief a senseless prey,  \nAnd ever and anon, assailed  \nBy floods of woe he wept and wailed,  \nStriving with eager speed to gain  \nThe margent of his sea of pain.  \n\nWith fiercer words she fiercer yet  \nThe hapless father's pleading met:  \n'O Monarch, if thy soul repent  \nThe promise and thy free consent,  \nHow wilt thou in the world maintain  \nThy fame for truth unsmirched with stain?  \nWhen gathered kings with thee converse,  \nAnd bid thee all the tale rehearse.  \nWhat wilt thou say, O truthful King,  \nIn answer to their questioning?  \n'She to whose love my life I owe,  \nWho saved me smitten by the foe,  \nKaikeyi, for her tender care,  \nWas cheated of the oath I sware. 1  \nThus wilt thou answer, and forsworn  \nWilt draw on thee the princes' scorn.  \nLearn from that tale, the 'Hawk and Dove,'  \nHow strong for truth was Saivya's love.  \nPledged by his word the monarch gave  \nHis flesh the suppliant bird to save.  \nSo King Alarka gave his eyes,  \nAnd gained a mansion in the skies.  \n\nThe Sea himself his promise keeps,  \nAnd ne'er beyond his limit sweeps.  \nMy deeds of old again recall,  \nNor let thy bond dishonoured fall.  \nThe rights of truth thou wouldst forget  \nThy Rama on the throne to set,  \nAnd let thy days in pleasure glide,  \nFond King, Kaus'alya by thy side.  \nNow call it by what name thou wilt,  \nJustice, injustice, virtue, guilt,  \nThy word and oath remain the same,  \nAnd thou must yield what thus I claim.  \nIf Rama be anointed, I  \nThis very day will surely die,  \nBefore thy face will poison drink,  \nAnd lifeless at thy feet will sink.  \nYea, better far to die than stay  \nAlive to see one single day  \nThe crowds before Kaus'alya stand  \nAnd hail her queen with reverent hand.  \nNow by my son, myself, I swear,  \nNo gift, no promise whatsoe'er  \nMy steadfast soul shall now content,  \nBut only Rama's banishment.'  \n\nSo far she spake by rage impelled,  \nAnd then the queen deep silence held.  \nHe heard her speech full fraught with ill,  \nBut spoke no word bewildered still,  \nGazed on his love once held so dear  \nWho spoke unlovely rede to hear;  \nThen as he slowly pondered o'er  \nThe queen's resolve and oath she swore.  \nOnce sighing forth, Ah Rama! he  \nFell prone as falls a smitten tree.  \nHis senses lost like one insane,  \nFaint as a sick man weak with pain,  \nOr like a wounded snake dismayed,  \nSo lay the king whom earth obeyed.  \nLong burning sighs he slowly heaved,  \nAs, conquered by his woe, he grieved,  \nAnd thus with tears and sobs between  \nHis sad faint words addressed the queen:  \n\n'By whom, Kaikeyi, wast thou taught  \nThis flattering hope with ruin fraught?  \nHave goblins seized thy soul, O dame,  \nWho thus canst speak and feel no shame?  \nThy mind with sin is sicklied o'er,  \nFrom thy first youth ne'er seen before.  \nA good and loving wife wast thou,  \nBut all, alas! is altered now.  \nWhat terror can have seized thy breast  \nTo make thee frame this dire request,  \nThat Bharat o'er the land may reign,  \nAnd Rama in the woods remain?  \nTurn from thine evil ways, O turn,  \nAnd thy perfidious counsel spurn,  \nIf thou would fain a favour do  \nTo people, lord, and Bharat too.  \nO wicked traitress, fierce and vile,  \nWho lovest deeds of sin and guile,  \n\np. 105  \n\nWhat crime or grievance dost thou see,  \nWhat fault in Rama or in me?  \nThy son will ne'er the throne accept  \nIf Rama from his rights be kept,  \nFor Bharat's heart more firmly yet  \nThan Rama's is on justice set.  \nHow shall I say, Go forth, and brook  \nUpon my Rama's face to look,  \nSee his pale cheek and ashy lips  \nDimmed like the moon in sad eclipse?  \nHow see the plan so well prepared  \nWhen prudent friends my counsels shared,  \nAll ruined, like a host laid low  \nBeneath some foeman's murderous blow?  \nWhat will these gathered princes say,  \nFrom regions near and far away?  \n'O'erlong endures the monarch's reign,  \nFor now he is a child again.'  \nWhen many a good and holy sage  \nIn Scripture versed, revered for age,  \nShall ask for Rama, what shall I  \nUnhappy, what shall I reply?  \n'By Queen Kaikeyi long distressed  \nI drove him forth and dispossessed.'  \nAlthough herein the truth I speak,  \nThey all will hold me false and weak.  \nWhat will Kaus'alya say when she  \nDemands her son exiled by me?  \nAlas! what answer shall I frame,  \nOr how console the injured dame?  \nShe like a slave on me attends,  \nAnd with a sister's care she blends  \nA mother's love, a wife's, a friend's.  \nIn spite of all her tender care,  \nHer noble son, her face most fair,  \nAnother queen I could prefer  \nAnd for thy sake neglected her,  \nBut now, O Queen, my heart is grieved  \nFor love and care by thee received,  \nE'en as the sickening wretch repents  \nHis dainty meal and condiments.  \nAnd how will Queen Sumitra trust  \nThe husband whom she finds unjust,  \nSeeing my Rama driven hence  \nDishonoured, and for no offence?  \nAh! the, Videhan bride will hear  \nA double woe, a double fear,  \nTwo whelming sorrows at one breath,  \nHer lord's disgrace, his father's death.  \nMine aged bosom she will wring  \nAnd kill me with her sorrowing,  \nSad as a fair nymph left to weep  \nDeserted on Himalaya's steep.  \nFor short will be my days, I ween,  \nWhen I with mournful eyes have seen  \nMy Rama wandering forth alone  \nAnd heard dear Sita sob and moan.  \nAh me! my fond belief I rue.  \nVile traitress, loved as good and true,  \nAs one who in his thirst has quaffed,  \nDeceived by looks, a deadly draught.  \nAh! thou hast slain me, murderess, while  \nSoothing my soul with words of guile,  \nAs the wild hunter kills the deer  \nLured from the brake his song to hear.  \nSoon every honest tongue will fling  \nReproach on the dishonest king;  \nThe people's scorn in every street  \nThe seller of his child will meet,  \nAnd such dishonour will be mine  \nAs whelms a Brahman drunk with wine.  \nAh me, for my unhappy fate,  \nCompelled thy words to tolerate!  \nSuch woe is sent to scourge a crime  \nCommitted in some distant time.  \nFor many a day with sinful care  \nI cherished thee, thou sin and snare,  \nKept thee, unwitting, like a cord  \nDestined to bind its hapless lord.  \nMine hours of ease I spent with thee,  \nNor deemed my love my death would be,  \nWhile like a heedless child I played,  \nOn a black snake my hand I laid.  \nA cry from every mouth will burst  \nAnd all the world will hold me curst,  \nBecause I saw my high-souled son  \nUnkinged, unfathered, and undone;  \n'The king by power of love beguiled  \nIs weaker than a foolish child,  \nHis own beloved son to make  \nAn exile for a woman's sake.  \nBy chaste and holy vows restrained,  \nBy reverend teachers duly trained.  \nWhen he his virtue's fruit should taste  \nHe falls by sin and woe disgraced.'  \nTwo words will all his answer be  \nWhen I pronounce the stern decree,  \n'Hence, Rama, to the woods away,'  \nAll he will say is, I obey.  \nO, if he would my will withstand  \nWhen banished from his home and land.  \nThis were a comfort in my woe;  \nBut he will ne'er do this, I know.  \nMy Rama to the forest fled,  \nAnd curses thick upon my head,  \nGrim Death will bear me hence away,  \nHis world-abominated prey.  \nWhen I am gone and Rama too.  \nHow wilt thou those I love pursue?  \nWhat vengeful sin will be designed  \nAgainst the queens I leave behind?  \nWhen thou hast slain her son and me  \nKaus'alya soon will follow: she  \nWill sink beneath her sorrows' weight,  \nAnd die like me disconsolate,  \nExist, Kaikeyi, in thy pride,  \nAnd let thy heart be gratified,  \nWhen thou my queens and me hast hurled,  \nAnd children, to the under world.  \nSoon wilt thou rule as empress o'er  \nMy noble house unvext before.  \nBut then to wild confusion left,  \n\np. 106  \n\nOf Rama and of me bereft.  \nIf Bharat to thy plan consent  \nAnd long for Rama's banishment,  \nNe'er let his hands presume to pay  \nThe funeral honours to my clay  \nVile foe, thou cause of all mine ill,  \nObtain at last thy cursed will.  \nA widow soon shalt thou enjoy  \nThe sweets of empire with thy boy.  \nO Princess, sure some evil fate  \nFirst brought thee here to devastate,  \nIn whom the night of ruin lies  \nVeiled in a consort's fair disguise.  \nThe scorn of all and deepest shame  \nWill long pursue my hated name,  \nAnd dire disgrace on me will press,  \nMisled by thee to wickedness.  \nHow shall my Rama, whom, before,  \nHis elephant or chariot bore,  \nNow with his feet, a wanderer, tread  \nThe forest wilds around him spread?  \nHow shall my son, to please whose taste,  \nThe deftest cooks, with earrings graced,  \nWith rivalry and jealous care  \nThe dainty meal and cates prepare--  \nHow shall he now his life sustain  \nWith acid fruit and woodland grain?  \nHe spends his time unvext by cares,  \nAnd robes of precious texture wears:  \nHow shall he, with one garment round  \nHis limbs recline upon the ground?  \nWhose was this plan, this cruel thought  \nUnheard till now, with ruin fraught,  \nTo make thy son Ayodhya's king,  \nAnd send my Rama wandering?  \nShame, shame on women! Vile, untrue,  \nTheir selfish ends they still pursue.  \nNot all of womankind I mean.  \nBut more than all this wicked queen.  \n   O worthless, cruel, selfish dame,  \n     I brought thee home, my plague and woe.  \n   What fault in me hast thou to blame,  \n     Or in my son who loves thee so?  \n   Fond wives may from their husbands flee,  \n     And fathers may their sons desert,  \n   But all the world would rave to see  \n     My Rama touched with deadly hurt.  \n   I joy his very step to hear,  \n     As though his godlike form I viewed;  \n   And when I see my Rama near  \n     I feel my youth again renewed.  \n   There might be life without the sun,  \n     Yea, e'en if Indra sent no rain,  \n   But, were my Rama banished, none  \n     Would, so I think, alive remain.  \n   A foe that longs my life to take,  \n     I brought thee here my death to be,  \n   Caressed thee long, a venomed snake,  \n     And through my folly die, Ah me!  \n   Rama and me and Lakshman slay,  \n     And then with Bharat rule the state;  \n   So bring the kingdom to decay,  \n     And fawn on those thy lord who hate,  \n   Plotter of woe, for evil bred,  \n     For such a speech why do not all  \n   Thy teeth from out thy wicked head  \n     Split in a thousand pieces fall?  \n   My Rama's words are ever kind,  \n     He knows not how to speak in ire:  \n   Then how canst thou presume to find  \n     A fault in him whom all admire?  \n   Yield to despair, go mad, or die,  \n     Or sink within the rifted earth;  \n   Thy fell request will I deny,  \n     Thou shamer of thy royal birth.  \n   Thy longer life I scarce can bear,  \n     Thou ruin of my home and race,  \n   Who wouldst my heart and heartstrings tear,  \n     Keen as a razor, false and base.  \n   My life is gone, why speak of joy?  \n     For what, without my son, were sweet?  \n   Spare, lady, him thou canst destroy;  \n     I pray thee as I touch thy feet.'  \n   He fell and wept with wild complaint.  \n     Heart-struck by her presumptuous speech,  \n   But could not touch, so weak and faint,  \n     The cruel feet he strove to reach.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[104:1](ry090.htm#fr_275) This story is told in the Mahabharat.
