And the goblin spoke to him again: "O King, why do you go to such\npains in this cemetery at night? Do you not see the home of the ghosts, full\nof dreadful creatures, terrible in the night, wrapped in darkness as in smoke?\nWhy do you work so hard and grow weary for the sake of that monk? Well, to\namuse the journey, listen to a puzzle which I will tell you."\n\n\n\nIn the Avanti country is a city built by the gods at the beginning of time,\nadorned with wonderful wealth and opportunities for enjoyment. In the earliest\nage it was called Lotus City, then Pleasure City, then Golden City, and now it\nis called Ujjain. There lived a king named Heroic. And his queen was named\nLotus.\n\nOne day the king went with her to the sacred Ganges river and prayed to Shiva\nthat he might have children. And after long prayer he heard a voice from\nheaven, for Shiva was at last pleased with his devotion: "O King, there shall\nbe born to you a brave son to continue your dynasty, and a daughter more\nbeautiful than the nymphs of heaven."\n\nWhen he heard the heavenly voice, the king was delighted at the fulfilment of\nhis wishes, and went back to his city with the queen. And first Queen Lotus\nbore a son called Brave, and then a daughter named Grace who put the god of\nlove to shame.\n\nWhen the girl grew up, the king sought for a suitable husband for her, and\ninvited all the neighbouring princes by letter, but not one of them seemed\ngood enough for her. So the king tenderly said to his daughter: "My dear, I do\nnot see a husband worthy of you, so I will summon all the kings hither, and\nyou shall choose." But the princess said: "My dear father, such a choice would\nbe very embarrassing. I would rather not. Just marry me to any good-looking\nyoung man, who understands a single science from beginning to end. I wish\nnothing more nor less than that."\n\nNow while the king was looking for such a husband, four brave, good-looking,\nscientific men from the south heard of the matter and came to him. And when\nthey had been hospitably received, each explained his own science to the king.\n\nThe first said: "I am a working-man, and my name is Five-cloth. I make five\nsplendid suits of clothes a day. One I give to some god and one to a Brahman.\nOne I wear myself, and one I shall give to my wife when I have one. The fifth\nI sell, to buy food and things. This is my science. Pray give me Grace."\n\nThe second said: "I am a farmer, and my name is Linguist. I understand the\ncries of all beasts and birds. Pray give me the princess."\n\nThe third said: "I am a strong-armed soldier, and my name is Swordsman. I have\nno rival on earth in the science of swordsmanship. O King, pray give me your\ndaughter."\n\nThe fourth said: "O King, I am a Brahman, and my name is Life. I possess a\nwonderful science. For if dead creatures are brought to me, I can quickly\nrestore them to life. Let your daughter find a husband in a man who has such\nheroic skill."\n\nWhen they had spoken, and the king had seen that they all had wonderful\ngarments and personal beauty, he and his daughter swung in doubt.\n\nWhen the goblin had told this story, he said to the king: "Remember the curse\nI mentioned, and tell me to which of them the girl should be given."\n\nAnd the king said to the goblin: "Sir, you are merely trying to gain time by\nmaking me break silence. There is no puzzle about that. How could a warrior\'s\ndaughter be given to a working-man, a weaver? Or to a farmer, either? And as\nto his knowledge of the speech of beasts and birds, of what practical use is\nit? And what good is a Brahman who neglects his own affairs and turns\nmagician, despising real courage? Of course she should be given to the warrior\nSwordsman who had some manhood with his science."\n\nWhen the goblin heard this, he escaped by magic from the king\'s shoulder, and\ndisappeared. And the king followed him as before. Discouragement never enters\nthe brave heart of a resolute man.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Tenth Goblin: The Three Delicate Wives of King Virtue-banner.
