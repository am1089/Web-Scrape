(The omniscience of Brahman follows) from its being the source of\nScripture.\n\np. 20\n\nBrahman is the source, i.e. the cause of the great body of Scripture,\nconsisting of the _Ri_ g-veda and other branches, which is supported by\nvarious disciplines (such as grammar, nyaya, pura _n_ a, &c.); which lamp-like\nilluminates all things; which is itself all-knowing as it were. For the origin\nof a body of Scripture possessing the quality of omniscience cannot be sought\nelsewhere but in omniscience itself. It is generally understood that the man\nfrom whom some special body of doctrine referring to one province of knowledge\nonly originates, as, for instance, grammar from Pa _n_ ini possesses a more\nextensive knowledge than his work, comprehensive though it be; what idea,\nthen, shall we have to form of the supreme omniscience and omnipotence of that\ngreat Being, which in sport as it were, easily as a man sends forth his\nbreath, has produced the vast mass of holy texts known as the _Ri_ g-veda,\n&c., the mine of all knowledge, consisting of manifold branches, the cause of\nthe distinction of all the different classes and conditions of gods, animals,\nand men! See what Scripture says about him, 'The _Ri_ g-veda, &c., have been\nbreathed forth from that great Being' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 10).\n\nOr else we may interpret the Sutra to mean that Scripture consisting of the\n_Ri_ g-veda, &c., as described above, is the source or cause, i.e. the means\nof right knowledge through which we understand the nature of Brahman. So that\nthe sense would be: through Scripture only as a means of knowledge Brahman is\nknown to be the cause of the origin, &c., of the world. The special scriptural\npassage meant has been quoted under the preceding Sutra 'from which these\nbeings are born,' &c.--But as the preceding Sutra already has pointed out a\ntext showing that Scripture is the source of Brahman, of what use then is the\npresent Sutra?--The words of the preceding Sutra, we reply, did not clearly\nindicate the scriptural passage, and room was thus left for the suspicion that\nthe origin, &c., of the world were adduced merely as determining an inference\n(independent of Scripture). To obviate this suspicion the Sutra under\ndiscussion has been propounded.\n\nBut, again, how can it be said that Scripture is the means of knowing Brahman?\nSince it has been declared that Scripture aims at action (according to the\nPurva Mima _m_ sa\n\np. 21\n\nSutra I, 2, 1, 'As the purport of Scripture is action, those scriptural\npassages whose purport is not action are purportless'), the Vedanta-passages\nwhose purport is not action are purportless. Or else if they are to have some\nsense, they must either, by manifesting the agent, the divinity or the fruit\nof the action, form supplements to the passages enjoining actions, or serve\nthe purpose of themselves enjoining a new class of actions, such as devout\nmeditation and the like. For the Veda cannot possibly aim at conveying\ninformation regarding the nature of accomplished substances, since the latter\nare the objects of perception and the other means of proof (which give\nsufficient information about them; while it is the recognised object of the\nVeda to give information about what is not known from other sources). And if\nit did give such information, it would not be connected with things to be\ndesired or shunned, and thus be of no use to man. For this very reason Vedic\npassages, such as 'he howled, &c.,' which at first sight appear purposeless,\nare shown to have a purpose in so far as they glorify certain actions (cp. Pu.\nMi. Su. I, 2, 7, 'Because they stand in syntactical connection with the\ninjunctions, therefore their purport is to glorify the injunctions'). In the\nsame way mantras are shown to stand in a certain relation to actions, in so\nfar as they notify the actions themselves and the means by which they are\naccomplished. So, for instance, the mantra, 'For strength thee (I cut;' which\naccompanies the cutting of a branch employed in the dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa-\nsacrifice). In short, no Vedic passage is seen or can be proved to have a\nmeaning but in so far as it is related to an action. And injunctions which are\ndefined as having actions for their objects cannot refer to accomplished\nexistent things. Hence we maintain that the Vedanta-texts are mere supplements\nto those passages which enjoin actions; notifying the agents, divinities, and\nresults connected with those actions. Or else, if this be not admitted, on the\nground of its involving the introduction of a subject-matter foreign to the\nVedanta-texts (viz. the subject-matter of the Karmaka _nd_ a of the Veda), we\nmust admit (the second of the two alternatives proposed above viz.) that the\n\np. 22\n\n[paragraph continues] Vedanta-texts refer to devout meditation (upasana) and\nsimilar actions which are mentioned in those very (Vedanta) texts. The result\nof all of which is that Scripture is not the source of Brahman.\n\nTo this argumentation the Sutrakara replies as follows:\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 4](sbe34010.htm)\n\n"
