(There are personal conductors) because that is established on the ground\nof both (i.e. road and travellers) being bewildered (i.e. unconscious).\n\nAs, owing to their separation from a body, the organs of those who go on the\nroad beginning with light are wrapped up, they are incapable of ruling\nthemselves; and the light &c., as they are without intelligence, are equally\nincapable. Hence it follows that the particular intelligent deities who\nrepresent light and the rest are appointed to the conductorship. For in\nordinary life also drunken or senseless people whose sense-organs are wrapped\nup follow a road as commanded by others.--Again light and the rest cannot be\ntaken for marks of the road because they are not always present. A man who\ndies in the night cannot come to day in its true (physical) nature; and he\ncannot wait (for the break of day), as we have already explained above (IV, 2,\n19). But this objection does not apply to gods who are permanent. And gods may\nbe called light and so on, because they represent light and so on. Nor is the\nexpression, 'From light to day,' &c. objectionable, even if we adopt the sense\nof conductorship; for it means, through the light as cause they come to the\nday; through the day as cause, to the waxing half of the moon. And such\ninstruction is seen also in the case of conductors known in ordinary life, for\nthey say, Go hence to Balavarman, thence (i.e. Balavarman conducting you) to\n_G_ ayasi _m_ ha, thence to\n\np. 389\n\n[paragraph continues] K _ri_ sh _n_ agupta. Moreover, in the beginning where\nthe text says that they go to the light, a relation in general only is\nexpressed, not a special relation; at the end, however, where it is said he\nleads them to Brahman, a special relation is expressed, viz. that between\nconducted and conductor. Therefore this is accepted for the beginning also.--\nAnd as the organs of the wandering souls are wrapped up together there is no\npossibility of their enjoying anything. Although, however, the wanderers do\nnot enjoy anything, the word 'world' may be explained on the ground that those\nworlds are places of enjoyment for other beings dwelling there--The conclusion\ntherefore is that he who has reached the world of Agni is led on by Agni, and\nhe who has reached the world ruled by Vayu, by Vayu.\n\nBut how, if we adopt the view of conductorship, can this apply to Varu _n_ a\nand the rest? Varu _n_ a and the rest were inserted above the lightning; but\nscripture states that after the lightning until Brahman is reached a person\nleads who is not a man.--To this doubt the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 3, 6](sbe38307.htm)\n\n"
