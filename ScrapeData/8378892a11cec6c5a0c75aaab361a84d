When his pious son Prahlada praised Vishun the\nDaitya tried to kill him, when the God appeared in the incarnation of the man-\nlion and tore the tyrant to pieces.\n\n[407:1b](ry363.htm#fr_837) Do unto others as thou wouldst they should do unto\nthee, is a precept frequently occurring in the old Indian poems.\n\nThis charity is to embrace not human beings only, but bird and beast as well:\n"He prayeth best who loveth best all things both great and small"\n\n[407:2b](ry363.htm#fr_838) It was the custom of Indian warriors to mark their\narrows with their ciphers or names, and it seems to have been regarded as a\npoint of honour to give an enemy the satisfaction of knowing who had shot at\nhim. This passage however contains, if my memory serves me well, the first\nmention in the poem of this practice, and as arrows have been so frequently\nmentioned and described with almost every conceivable epithet, its occurrence\nhere seems suspicious. No mention of, or allusion to writing has hitherto\noccurred in the poem.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXII.: Ravan\'s Threat.](ry364.htm)\n\n'
