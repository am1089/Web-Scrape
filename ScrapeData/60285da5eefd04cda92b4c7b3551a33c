Luchmee has become your handmaid, and constantly attends upon\nyou; you are the god of all the gods; no one understands your nature; your\nsplendour, is in the moon, the sun, the earth and the sky; you shine in every\nplace; your delusive power is very mighty; it has led astray the whole world.\nIn the three worlds, there is no god, man or sage, who can escape from its\ninfluence."\n\nHaving thus spoken, Basoodeo Jee again said, "Lord! no one comprehends the\nmysteries of your state, in the Vedas they are described as unfathomable, you\nhave neither enemies nor friends; nor are sons, father and brothers dear to\nyou. You have descended upon the earth to remove its burthens; and, for the\nsake of men, have assumed many different semblances."\n\nO great king! having thus spoken, Basoodeo Jee said,--"O sea of compassion and\nbrother of the poor! in the same\n\np. 419\n\nmanner as thou hast saved many sinners compassionately grant me salvation\nalso, in order that having crossed the sea of existence, I may sing of thy\nexcellent attributes." Shree Krishnu Chund replied, "Father! you are wise, why\ndo you exalt your sons? Think a little in your mind that the acts of Bhugwut\nare infinite; no one has to this day ascertained the limits of them. Behold!\nhe shines in every mortal frame, and therefore the world calls him \'The being\nwithout passions or human qualities.\' He creates, he destroys, he remains\nmixed with the world, but can never be bound by it. Earth, sky, air, water and\nfire, the five elements of the body, in them all the power of the lord abides.\nThe sacred precepts of the Vedas have declared this."\n\nO great king! on hearing these words from the mouth of Shree Krishnu Chund\nJee, Basoodeo, being under the influence of fascination, was silent and\nremained gazing on the countenance of Huri; then Krishnu went thence to his\nmother, and on seeing her son, Dewukee Jee said, "O! Shree Krishnu Chund, the\nroot of joy! one grief at times pierces me." Krishnu enquired, "What it was?"\nDewukee Jee replied, "Son! grief for the loss of your six elder brothers, whom\nKuns destroyed, never departs from my mind."\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! on his saying this, Shree Krishnu\nChund Jee went to the regions below, having first said to his mother, "Mourn\nnot now, I will bring my brothers here immediately," When Raja Buli received\nintelligence of Krishnu\'s arrival, he came out to meet him; and, having with\ngreat pomp and preparation, spread silken cloths for him to walk upon,\nescorted him to his own abode; having afterwards seated him on a throne, and\nput sandal, unbroken rice and flowers upon his forehead, and placed before him\nperfumes, lamps and consecrated food, Raja Buli worshipped Shree Krishnu\nChund, then standing before him with joined hands, and glorifying him greatly,\nhe said, "O great king! why have you come here?" Huri replied "Raja! in\n\np. 420\n\nthe age of truth (or in the good age) there was a sage named Mureech, a great,\nreligious student, wise, a speaker of the truth and a devout worshipper of\nHuri; his wife\'s name was Oorna, who had six sons. One day, the six brothers\nin their youthful state having gone before the Raja (the lord of subjects)\nlaughed; observing that they laughed, the Raja was very angry, and pronounced\nthis curse, \'Go, and descend upon the earth as demons.\' O great king! on\nhearing this curse, the sage\'s sons were greatly alarmed, and went and fell at\nthe feet of the Raja; and having beseeched him greatly said, with the utmost\nhumility, \'O sea of compassion! you have pronounced a curse; but be pleased to\nfavour us by saying; when we shall be liberated from it.\' Having heard their\nhumble speech, the Raja taking compassion upon them, said, \'When you see Shree\nKrishnu\' Chund, you will be released.\' O great king! on his saying this, they\ngave up the ghost, and became the sons of Hurinakoos; then they were born as\nthe sons of Basoodeo, whom Kuns came and murdered, on their being slain, the\ndelusive power brought them here, and, conferring happiness, placed them in\nthis abode; their mother Dewukee mourns for them; for this reason, I am come\nhere, that I may take away my brothers with me and present them to my mother,\nand remove the anxiety of her mind."\n\nShree Shookdeo Jee said, Raja! when Huri had thus spoken, Raja Buli brought\nand gave him the six children, and placed before him many presents; then\nKrishnu came thence with his brothers to his mother; who, on seeing her sons,\nwas highly delighted; when the [inhabitants](errata.htm#25) heard this, there\nwas joy throughout the city, and the curse pronounced upon the sons\nterminated.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXXVI](psa87.htm)\n\n'
