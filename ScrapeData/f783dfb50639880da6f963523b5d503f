It is because he rose in\nfront (agre) of that offering 1, that the Agnihotra is the Sun.\n\n2:3:1:22\\. When he offers in the evening after sunset, he does so thinking, \'I\nwill offer, while he is here, who is this (offering);\' and when he offers in\nthe morning before sunrise, he does so thinking, \'I will offer, while he is\nhere, who is this (offering):\' and for this reason, they say, the Agnihotra is\nthe Sun.\n\n2:3:1:33\\. And when he sets, then he, as an embryo, enters that womb, the\nfire; and along with him thus becoming an embryo, all these creatures become\nembryos; for, being coaxed, they lie down contented 2.\n\np. 328\n\n[paragraph continues] The reason, then, why the night envelops that (sun), is\nthat embryos also are, as it were, enveloped.\n\n2:3:1:44\\. Now when he offers in the evening after sunset, he offers for the\ngood of that (sun) in the embryo state, he benefits that embryo; and since he\noffers for the good of that (sun) in the embryo state, therefore embryos here\nlive without taking food.\n\n2:3:1:55\\. And when he offers in the morning before sunrise, then he produces\nthat (sun-child) and, having become a light, it rises shining. But, assuredly,\nit would not rise, were he not to make that offering: this is why he performs\nthat offering.\n\n2:3:1:66\\. Even as a snake frees itself from its skin, so does it (the sun-\nchild) free itself from the night, from evil: and, verily, whosoever, knowing\nthis, offers the Agnihotra, he frees himself from all evil, even as a snake\nfrees itself from its skin; and after his birth all these creatures are born;\nfor they are set free according to their inclination.\n\n2:3:1:77\\. Then, as to his taking out the \xc3\x82havaniya (from the Garhapatya)\nbefore the setting of the sun;--the rays, doubtless, are all those gods; and\nwhat highest light there is, that, indeed, is either Pra _g_ apati or Indra.\nNow all the gods approach the house of him who performs the Agnihotra: but\nwhosesoever (offering) they approach before the fire has been taken out, from\nthat the gods turn away, and he fails in it; and after the failure of that\n(offering) from which the gods turn away, people say, that, whether one knows\nit or not, the sun went down on account of that (fire) not having been taken\nout.\n\n2:3:1:88\\. And another reason why he takes out the \xc3\x82havaniya before the\nsetting of the sun, is this. In like manner as, when one\'s better comes to\nvisit\n\np. 329\n\none, he would honour him by trimming his house, so here: for whosesoever\n(offering) they approach, after the fire has been taken out, his \xc3\x82havaniya\n(house) they enter, in his \xc3\x82havaniya they repose.\n\n2:3:1:99\\. Now when he offers in the evening after the sun has set, he thereby\noffers to them after they have entered his fire-house; and when he offers in\nthe morning before sunrise, he offers to them before they go away. Therefore\n\xc3\x82suri said, \'The Agnihotra of those who offer after sunrise we regard as\nuseless 1: it is as if one were to take food to an empty dwelling.\'\n\n2:3:1:1010\\. That which affords (the means of) subsistence is of two kinds;\nnamely, either rooted or rootless. On both of these, which belong to the gods,\nmen subsist. Now cattle are rootless and plants are rooted. From the rootless\ncattle eating the rooted plants and drinking water, that juice is produced.\n\n2:3:1:1111\\. Now when he offers in the evening after sunset, he does so\nthinking, \'I will offer to the gods of this life-giving juice: we subsist on\nthis which belongs to them.\' And when he afterwards takes his evening meal, he\neats what remains of the offering, and whereof oblative portions (bali) have\nbeen distributed all round 2; for he who performs the Agnihotra eats only what\nremains of the offering.\n\n2:3:1:1212\\. And when he offers in the morning before sunrise, he does so\nthinking, \'I will offer to the gods of this life-giving juice: we subsist on\nthis which belongs to them.\' And when he afterwards takes his meal in the day-\ntime, he eats what remains of the\n\np. 330\n\noffering, and whereof oblative portions have been distributed all round; for\nhe who performs the Agnihotra eats only what remains of the offering.\n\n2:3:1:1313\\. Here now they say,--All other sacrifices come to an end, but the\nAgnihotra does not come to an end. Although that which lasts for twelve years\nis indeed limited, this (Agnihotra) is nevertheless unlimited, since, when one\nhas offered in the evening, he knows that he will offer in the morning; and\nwhen one has offered in the morning, he knows that he will again offer in the\nevening. Hence that Agnihotra is unlimited, and in consequence of this its\nunlimitedness, creatures are here born unlimited. And, verily, he who thus\nknows the unlimitedness of the Agnihotra, is himself born unlimited in\nprosperity and offspring.\n\n2:3:1:1414\\. Having milked 1 he puts that (milk) on (the Garhapatya fire),\nbecause it has to be cooked. Here now they say, \'When it rises to the brim,\nthen we shall offer it!\' He must not however let it rise to the brim, since he\nwould burn it, if he were to let it rise to the brim; and unproductive indeed\nis burnt seed: he must not, therefore, let it rise to the brim.\n\n2:3:1:1515\\. He should not offer it without having put it on the fire; for\nsince this is Agni\'s seed, therefore it is hot ( _s_ _ri_ ta, \'cooked\'); and\nby putting it on the\n\np. 331\n\nfire, it is indeed heated: let him, therefore, offer (of the milk) only after\nhe has put it on the fire.\n\n2:3:1:1616\\. He illumines it (with a burning straw) 1 in order that he may\nknow when it is done. He then pours some water to it (with the sruva), both\nfor the sake of appeasement, and in order to supplement the juice. For when it\nrains here; then plants spring up; and in consequence of the plants being\neaten and the water drunk, this juice is produced: hence it is in order to\nsupplement the juice (that he pours water to it); and therefore, if it should\nhappen to him to have to drink pure milk, let him have one drop of water\npoured into it, both for the sake of appeasement, and in order to supplement\nthe juice.\n\n2:3:1:1717\\. Thereupon he ladles four times (milk with the sruva into the\nAgnihotra ladle 2), for in a fourfold way was that milk supplied 3. He then\ntakes a kindling-stick (samidh), and hastes up (to the \xc3\x82havaniya, with the\nladle) to make the libation on the burning (stick) 4. He offers the first\nlibation\n\np. 332\n\n[paragraph continues] (purvahuti) without putting down (the spoon) beside (the\nfire, on the grass-bunch). For, were he to put it down beside (the fire), it\nwould be as if, in taking food to somebody, one were to put it down on one\'s\nway thither. But when (he makes the libation) without previously putting it\ndown, it is as if, in taking food to somebody, one puts it down only after\ntaking it to him. The second (libation he then makes) after putting it down:\nhe thereby makes these two (libations) of various vigour. Now these two:\nlibations are mind and speech: hence he thereby separates mind and speech from\neach other; and thus mind and speech, even while one and the same (samana),\nare still distinct (nana).\n\n2:3:1:1818\\. Twice he offers in the fire, twice he wipes (the spout of the\nspoon), twice he eats (of the milk), and four times he ladles 1;--these are\nten (acts), for\n\np. 333\n\nof ten syllables consists the vira _g_ stanza, and the sacrifice is vira _g_\n(shining): he thereby converts the sacrifice into the vira _g_.\n\n2:3:1:1919\\. Now what he offers up in the fire, that he offers to the gods;\nand thereby the gods are (admitted to the sacrifice) 1. And what he wipes off\n(the spoons), that he offers to the fathers and plants; and thereby the\nfathers and plants are (admitted). And what he eats after offering, that he\noffers to men; and thereby men are (admitted).\n\n2:3:1:2020\\. Verily, the creatures that are not allowed to take part in the\nsacrifice are forlorn; to those creatures that are not forlorn he thus offers\na share at the opening of the sacrifice; and thus beasts (cattle) are made to\nshare in it along with (men), since beasts are behind men 2.\n\n2:3:1:2121\\. On this point Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said, \'It (the Agnihotra) must\nnot be looked upon as a (havis-) sacrifice, but as a domestic sacrifice\n(pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a); for while in any other (havis-)sacrifice he pours into the\nfire all that he cuts off (from the sacrificial dish and puts) into the\noffering spoon,--here, after offering and stepping outside 3, he sips water\nand licks out (the milk); and this indeed (is a characteristic) of the\ndomestic offering.\' This then is the animal\n\np. 334\n\ncharacteristic 1 of that (Agnihotra), for the domestic offering pertains to\nbeasts (or cattle).\n\n2:3:1:2222\\. Now the first of these libations, doubtless, is the same as that\nwhich Pra _g_ apati offered in the beginning 2; and as those (gods) thereupon\ncontinued (to sacrifice) 3,--namely, Agni, that blower (Vayu), and Surya,--so\nthis second libation is offered.\n\n2:3:1:2323\\. What first libation (purvahuti) is made, that is the deity of the\nAgnihotra 4, and to that (deity) it is accordingly offered; and what second\none (uttarahuti) is made, that indeed is equivalent to the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t\n(Agni, the maker of good offering); whence he offers it on the north part (of\nthe fire), since that is the region of the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t 5. Moreover,\nthis second libation is made in order to effect a pairing, for a couple forms\na productive pair.\n\n2:3:1:2424\\. These two libations, then, form a duad: the past and the future,\nthe born and the to-be-born, the actual 6 and the hope, the to-day and the\nmorrow,--(these are) after the manner of that duad.\n\n2:3:1:2525\\. The past is the self, for certain is that which is past, and\ncertain also is that which is a self. The future, on the other hand, is\nprogeny; for uncertain is that which is to be, and uncertain also is progeny.\n\n2:3:1:2626\\. The born is the self, for certain is that which is born, and\ncertain also is the self. The to-be-born,\n\np. 335\n\non the other hand, is progeny; for uncertain is what is to be born, and\nuncertain also is progeny.\n\n2:3:1:2727\\. The actual is the self, for certain is what is actual, and\ncertain also is the self. And hope is progeny, for uncertain is hope, and\nuncertain also is progeny.\n\n2:3:1:2828\\. The to-day is the self, for certain is what is to-day, and\ncertain also is the self. The morrow is progeny, for uncertain is the morrow,\nand uncertain also is progeny.\n\n2:3:1:2929\\. Now that first libation is offered on account of the self: he\noffers it with a sacred text, for certain is the sacred text, and certain also\nis the self. And that second one is offered on account of progeny: he offers\nit silently, for uncertain is what (is done) silently, and uncertain also is\nprogeny.\n\n2:3:1:3030\\. [In the evening] he offers (the first libation), with the text\n(Va _g_. S. III, 9, 10), \'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Svaha!\' and in\nthe morning with, \'Surya (the sun) is the light, the light is Surya, Svaha!\'\nThus offering is made with the truth; for, truly, when the sun goes down, then\nAgni (fire) is the light, and when the sun rises, then Surya is the light; and\nwhatever is offered with the truth, that, indeed, goes to the gods.\n\n2:3:1:3131\\. Here now Takshan recited for \xc3\x82ru _n_ i 1, who wished to obtain\nholy lustre (brahmavar _k_ asa, inspired nature), \'Agni is lustre, light is\nlustre;\'--\'Surya is lustre, light is lustre.\' Holy lustre, therefore, he\nobtains whosoever, knowing this, thus offers the Agnihotra.\n\np. 336\n\n2:3:1:3232\\. That (other text), however, has the characteristic form of\ngeneration. In saying, \'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Svaha!\' he\nencloses that seed, the light, on both sides with the deity; and the seed,\nthus enclosed on both sides, is brought forth: thus enclosing it on both sides\nhe causes it to be brought forth.\n\n2:3:1:3333\\. And when, in the morning, he says, \'Surya is the light, the light\nis Surya, Svaha!\' he encloses that seed, the light, on both sides with the\ndeity, and the seed, thus enclosed on both sides, is brought forth: thus\nenclosing it on both sides he causes it to be brought forth; and this, indeed,\nis the characteristic form of generation.\n\n2:3:1:3434\\. But _G_ ivala _K_ ailaki said 1, \'\xc3\x82ru _n_ i merely causes\nconception to take place, not birth: let him therefore offer with that (text,\nin par. 32) in the evening.\n\n2:3:1:3535\\. Then, in the morning, by the text, "The light is Surya, Surya is\nthe light," he places that seed, the light, outside by means of the deity; and\nthe seed thus brought outside he causes to be born.\'\n\n2:3:1:3636\\. They also say, \'In the evening he offers Surya in Agni, and in\nthe morning he offers Agni in Surya 2.\' Such, indeed, is the case with those\nwho offer after sunrise; for when the sun sets then Agni is the light, and\nwhen the sun rises then Surya is the light. Here no offence is committed on\nhis (the sacrificer\'s) part; but an offence is indeed committed where offering\nis not made distinctly to that deity (viz. Agni or Surya resp.), which is the\ndeity of the Agnihotra.\n\np. 337\n\n[paragraph continues] He says 1, \'Agni is the light, the light is Agni,\nSvaha!\' and not, \'To Agni Svaha!\' and in the morning, \'Surya is the light, the\nlight is Surya, Svaha!\' and not, \'To Surya Svaha!\'\n\n2:3:1:3737\\. He may also offer (in the evening) with this text (Va _g_. S.\nIII, 10), \'Along with the divine Savit _ri_ \\--,\' whereby it (the sacrifice)\nbecomes possessed of Savit _ri_ for his impulsion; \'--along with the Night,\nwedded to Indra--,\' whereby he effects a union with the night, and makes it\n(the sacrifice) possessed of Indra, for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice; \'\n--may Agni graciously accept! Svaha!\' whereby he offers to Agni in a direct\nmanner.\n\n2:3:1:3838\\. And in the morning with, \'Along with the divine Savit _ri_ \\--,\'\nwhereby it becomes possessed of Savit _ri_ for his impulsion; \'--along with\nthe Dawn, wedded to Indra,\' or \'along with the Day . . . .--,\' whereby he\neffects a union either with the day or the dawn 2, and makes it (the\nsacrifice) possessed of Indra; for Indra is the deity of sacrifice; \'--may\nSurya graciously accept! Svaha!\' whereby he offers to Surya directly: hence he\nmay offer in this way.\n\n2:3:1:3939\\. They then spake, \'Who shall offer this unto us?\'--\'The priest\n(brahma _n_ a)!\'--\'Priest, offer this  unto us! What is to be my share then?\nThe residue of the Agnihotra!\' Now what he leaves in\n\np. 338\n\nthe ladle, that is the residue of the Agnihotra; and what remains in the pot,\nis as (the rice for oblations which) one takes out from the enclosed part (of\nthe cart) 1. And if any one is to drink it, at least none but a Brahman must\ndrink it 2: for it is put on the fire (and thereby consecrated), and hence\nnone but a Brahman must drink it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[327:1](sbe1248.htm#fr_744) Apparently an etymological play on the word\nagnihotra = agre hotrasya, cf.

According to Katy. IV, 14, 1 he has the Agnihotra cow--standing\nsouth of the sacrificial ground and facing the east or north--milked by\nanybody except a Sudra. The vessel to be used is of earthenware, and must have\nbeen made by an \xc3\x82rya. The Adhvaryu then takes the vessel, and having entered\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya house by the east door and passed over to the Garhapatya, puts\nit there on coals previously shifted northwards from the fire.\n\n[331:1](sbe1248.htm#fr_749) According to Katy. IV, 14, 5 the Adhvaryu\nillumines the milk with a burning straw; pours some water to it with the sruva\nor dipping-spoon; then illumines it once more; and lifts up the pot three\nseveral times, putting it down each time further north of the fire. Thereupon\nhe warms the two spoons; and wipes them with his hand; and having warmed them\nonce more, he says to the sacrificer, \'I ladle!\' The latter, while standing,\nreplies, \'Om, ladle!\'\n\n[331:2](sbe1248.htm#fr_750) For the Agnihotra-hava _n_ i, or offering-spoon\n(sru _k_ ), used at the morning and evening libation, and made of Vikankata\nwood (Flacourtia Sapida), see [p. 67](sbe1211.htm#page_67), note\n[2](sbe1212.htm#fn_207). In the case of those who make five cuttings from the\nhavis (pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avattin, cf. [p. 192](sbe1231.htm#page_192) note) he takes\nfive sruva-fuls. Katy.

Comm.\n\n[331:4](sbe1248.htm#fr_752) While holding a billet or kindling-stick (samidh)\nover the (handle of) the milk-ladle, he [first holds the latter close over the\nGarhapatya fire, and thereupon] takes it to the \xc3\x82havaniya, keeping p. 332 it\non a level with his mouth, except in the middle between the two fires, where\nhe lowers it for a moment to the level of his navel. He then crouches down\n[bending his right knee, and looking eastwards, by the north-west corner of\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya], puts the billet on [the centre of] the fire, and makes the\nfirst libation (purvahuti) on the burning stick (see the formula, par. 30. The\nsacrificer, as usual, pronounces the dedicatory formula, viz. \'This to Agni!\'\nand, \'This to Surya!\' respectively). Thereupon he lays down the ladle on the\nkur _k_ a [a grass-bunch, placed behind the \xc3\x82havaniya fire-place, to serve as\na seat, and to wipe the hands on; according to others, a flat piece of Vara\n_n_ a wood], then takes it up again and silently makes the second libation\n(uttarahuti) on the north part of the fire. Katy. IV, 14, 12-17 with Schol.\n\n[332:1](sbe1248.htm#fr_753) He ladles four sruva-fuls of milk into the\nAgnihotra ladle, and makes in the \xc3\x82havaniya fire two libations from this milk\n(so as to leave the larger quantity in the ladle to be eaten). He then wipes\ntwice the spout of the ladle. [In each of the two other fires he thereupon\nmakes likewise two libations with the sruva, of one spoonful each.] The milk\nleft in the ladle he eats, on the completion of the six libations, by twice\ntaking it out with his ring-finger.\n\n[333:1](sbe1248.htm#fr_754) Tasmad deva _h_ santi; anvabhakta _h_ (\'allowed to\nshare in the sacrifice\') has probably to be supplied here from the next\nparagraph.\n\n[333:2](sbe1248.htm#fr_755) Instead of this paragraph, the Ka _n_ va text\nreads: \'Behind men are beasts; behind the gods are birds, plants, trees, and\nwhatever else exists here. Thus he makes these creatures share in the\nsacrifice, those that are not forlorn here.\' Compare I, 5, 2, 4.\n\n[333:3](sbe1248.htm#fr_756) Uts _ri_ pya is variously explained by the\ncommentators here and on Katy.
