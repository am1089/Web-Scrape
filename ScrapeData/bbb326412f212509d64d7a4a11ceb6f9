He pours (the ground rice) into that which contains the strainers--\nviz. into a dish (patri) on which he has laid the two strainers--with the text\n(Va _g_. S. I, 21): 'At the impulse of the divine Savit _ri_ I pour thee out,\nwith the arms of the A _s_ vins, with the hands of Pushan!' The import of this\nformula is the same (as before, I, 1, 2, 17).\n\n1:2:2:22\\. He now sits down somewhere inside the altar (vedi) 1. Then some one\n(viz. the \xc3\x82gnidhra) comes with the kneading-water 2 and brings it to him. He\n(the Adhvaryu) receives it through the strainers, with the text (Va _g_. S. I,\n21): 'Let the waters mingle with the plants!' for thereby the water unites\nwith the plants, viz. with the ground rice,--'The plants with the sap!' for\nthe plants thereby unite with the sap; viz. that ground rice with the water,\nfor water is their sap,--'The shining (or wealthy ones) with the moving!' for\nthe shining ones are the waters, and the moving ones are the plants, and these\ntwo are thereby mixed together,--'Let the sweet mingle with the sweet!'\nwhereby he says, 'let the savoury be mixed with the savoury!'\n\n1:2:2:33\\. He then mixes (the two) together, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 22):\n'For generation I unite thee!' for, in order that it (the dough or the\nsacrificial cake prepared from it) may bring offspring to the sacrificer,\n\np. 43\n\nfor his prosperity, for food, and so on,--for these reasons he mixes them\ntogether. And he also mixes them together with the intention of placing it\n(the dough) on (the fire): hence, in order that it (the sacrificial cake) may\nbe produced over the fire, for that purpose also he mixes them together.\n\n1:2:2:44\\. He now divides it into two halves, if there be two oblations: at\nthe full-moon sacrifice there really are two oblations. He then touches them,\n--where (by so doing) he would not again mix (the two) together,--with the\n(respective) formulas (Va _g_. S. I, 22): 'This to Agni!' 'This to Agni-Soma!'\nSeparately indeed they take that sacrificial food (from the cart) in the first\nplace 1; then they thresh it together, then they grind it together, then he\nagain divides it: for this reason he thus touches (them separately). The one\n(the Adhvaryu) now places the cake over (the fire), the other (the \xc3\x82gnidhra)\nputs the clarified butter on:\n\n1:2:2:55\\. These two acts are done simultaneously. The reason why these two\nacts are done simultaneously is that one half of the body of the sacrifice no\ndoubt is that butter, and the other half is this rice-offering. 'That half and\nthis half, these two let us now take to the fire!' thus (they think): for this\nreason those two acts are done simultaneously, and thus this body of the\nsacrifice is joined together.\n\n1:2:2:66\\. That one (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) puts the butter on, with the text (Va _g_.\nS. I, 22): 'For sap--thee!' When he says 'for sap thee!' he says it for the\nsake of rain; therefore he takes it off again, with the text (Va _g_. S. I,\n30): 'For juice--thee!' What juice is\n\np. 44\n\nderived (by the plants) from the rain, for that he says this.\n\n1:2:2:77\\. Now he (the Adhvaryu) puts on (adhi-v _ri_ _g_ ) the cake, with the\ntext (Va _g_. S. I, 22): 'Heat (or a hot vessel, gharma) art thou!' whereby he\nmakes it (a means of) sacrifice, and puts it on in the same (way as if he were\nputting the (pravargya) cauldron gharma) 1 on,--'Life-sustaining (vi _s_\nvayus)!' he adds, whereby he obtains life (for the sacrificer).\n\n1:2:2:88\\. He spreads it (over the respective potsherds), with the text (Va\n_g_. S. I, 22): 'Spread widely, thou wide-spreading one!' whereby he causes it\nto spread. He adds: 'May thy Lord of Sacrifice spread widely (prosper)!' Lord\nof Sacrifice, namely, is the sacrificer: hence it is for the sacrificer that\nhe thereby prays for blessing.\n\n1:2:2:99\\. Let him not make it too broad; for he would make it a human\n(profane, common cake), if he were to make it (too) broad. Unlucky for (or,\nexcluded from) the sacrifice indeed is that one, to wit, the common (cake).\n'That I may not do anything that\n\np. 45\n\nis unlucky at the sacrifice,' thus (he thinks, and) for that reason he should\nnot make it too broad.\n\n1:2:2:1010\\. And some now say: 'He should make it of the size of a horse's\nhoof!' But who knows how large is a horse's hoof? Let him make it of such a\nsize as in his own mind he does not think would be too broad.\n\n1:2:2:1111\\. He then touches it over with water, either once or three times:\nfor whatever in this (rice-offering) they either injure or tear asunder in the\nthreshing or grinding of it, that--water being (a means of) expiation (or\npurification)--he thereby expiates with water, that is, with (the means of)\nexpiation; that he thereby makes good: for this reason he touches it over with\nwater.\n\n1:2:2:1212\\. He touches it over, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 22): 'May the\nfire not injure thy skin!' for on the fire he is now going to heat it: 'May\nthat (fire) not injure thy skin!' this is what he thereby says.\n\n1:2:2:1313\\. He now carries fire round it 1. By this he encloses it with an\nunbroken fence, lest the evil\n\np. 46\n\nspirits, the Rakshas, should seize upon it; for Agni (fire) is the _r_ epeller\nof the Rakshas: this is the reason why he carries fire round it.\n\n1:2:2:1414\\. He bakes 1 it, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 22): 'Let the divine\n(or God) Savit _ri_ bake thee!' for it is not a man that bakes it, but a god\nit is: therefore it is the God Savit _ri_ that bakes it 2. He adds: 'In the\nhighest heaven!' He means to say 'among the gods,' when he says 'in the\nhighest heaven.' He touches it: 'I will ascertain whether it is done!' thus\n(he thinks, and) for that reason he touches it.\n\n1:2:2:1515\\. He touches it, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 23): 'Be not afraid!\nshrink not!' He thereby says: 'Do not thou be afraid, do not thou shrink,\nbecause I, a man, touch thee that art not human!'\n\n1:2:2:1616\\. When it is done, he covers it over (with hot ashes): 'Lest the\nevil spirits, the Rakshas, should espy it,' thus (he thinks) and 'Lest it\nshould lie, as it were, naked and despoiled!' thus also (he thinks):--that is\nthe reason why he covers it over.\n\n1:2:2:1717\\. He covers it over, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 23): 'May the\nsacrifice not be liable to languish, nor the sacrificer's race liable to\nlanguish!' 'That the sacrifice or the sacrificer may not languish after this,\nwhen I cover this over,' thus (he thinks, and) for this reason he covers it\nover in this manner (i.e. with the above text).\n\np. 47\n\n1:2:2:1818\\. He then pours out for the \xc3\x82ptya deities the water with which the\ndish has been rinsed and that in which he has washed his fingers 1. The reason\nwhy he pours it out for the \xc3\x82ptyas (is this):\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[42:1](sbe1208.htm#fr_163) 'He sits down (with the dish) either behind the\ncooking fire, or inside the altar,' Katy. II, 5, 11. According to Mahadeva,\nthe former alternative is the one favoured by the Ka _n_ vas.\n\n[42:2](sbe1208.htm#fr_164) According to Katy. II, 5, I, the kneading-water (or\nmixing-water, upasar _g_ ani) has been put on the (Garhapatya) fire (by the\nAgnidh) at the time of, or previously to, the spreading of the black antelope\nskin.\n\n[43:1](sbe1208.htm#fr_165) See I, 1, 2, 17 seq., especially [p.\n17](sbe1204.htm#page_17), note [2](sbe1204.htm#fn_108).\n\n[44:1](sbe1208.htm#fr_166) Gharma, literally 'heat,' is also the technical\nterm for a kind of cauldron (also called mahavira) used at the Pravargya\nceremony, a preparatory rite of the Soma-sacrifice: the empty cauldron is\nthere put on the fire, and when thoroughly heated (whence its name), fresh\nmilk is poured into it. The technical phrase for putting on the cauldron is\npra-v _ri_ _g_ , from which pravargya is derived; and the same verb, though\nwith a different preposition (viz. adhi-v _ri_ _g_ ), being technically used\nfor the putting on of the sacrificial cake, this verbal coincidence has\nprobably suggested this connection of the two ceremonies, there being a\nconstant tendency to establish some kind of relation between ordinary\nofferings and the Soma-sacrifice, as the most solemn one; cf. III, 4, 4, 1; X,\n2, 5, 3 seq.; Ait. Br. I, 18 seq. Previously to the spreading of the cake, the\ncinders are swept off from the potsherds with the grass-brush (veda), Hilleb.\np. 41, note 7.\n\n[45:1](sbe1208.htm#fr_167) The paryagnikara _n_ am consists in performing\npradakshi _n_ a (see [p. 37](sbe1207.htm#page_37), note\n[1](sbe1207.htm#fn_150)) on an object whilst holding a fire-brand or burning\ncoal; or (according to the Paddhati) in moving one's hand, which holds the\nburning coal, round the oblation, from left to right. According to Katy. II,\n5, 22, the Adhvaryu does so on the present occasion, whilst muttering the\nformula, 'Removed is the Rakshas! removed are the enemies!' (Taitt. S. I, 1,\n8, 1.) This practice of paryagnikara _n_ am may be compared with the carrying\nof fire round houses, fields, boats, &c., on the last night of the year, a\ncustom which, according to Mr. A. Mitchell (The Past in the Present, p. 145),\nstill prevails in some parts of Scotland, and which he thinks is probably a\nsurvival of some form of fire-worship, and intended to secure fertility and\ngeneral prosperity. The obvious meaning of the ceremony would seem to be the\nwarding off of the dark and mischievous powers of nature.\n\n[46:1](sbe1208.htm#fr_168) On the upper side it is baked by burning straw put\non or held over it, whereby it takes a crust (tva _k_ , skin'). Schol. on\nKaty. II, 5, 23.\n\n[46:2](sbe1208.htm#fr_169) With the name of no other God the epithet deva\n('shining,' 'God') is so frequently used as with that of Savit _ri_ : hence,\naccording to the author's reasoning, it is he that must be intended, whenever\na god not otherwise specified is alluded to.\n\n[47:1](sbe1208.htm#fr_170) The washing of the fingers and the dish, and has\ntaken place after the putting on and touching over of the cake, and before the\nparyagnikara _n_ am is performed.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 3.
