Muir, whose Poems I have quoted in these pages, from\nhis well known Metrical Translations, of the Sanskrit Writers, and also to\nIrene Ward, Grace Curtis and Clare Mc Kinney for their wonderful help in the\nrevision of this volume.\n\n**The Author**\n\np. 7\n\n### INTRODUCTION\n\nWe have two Yoga Vashishts, one going under the name great, the other small.\nThis is the small book; both hooks are the work of the Rishi Vashisht, and it\nis the book for those who are seeking truth but not for the ignorant. It is\nthe best book on wisdom and gives seven states of wisdom by understanding the\nliberation easily to be attained, and it also gives us the seven states of\nignorance. It gives spiritual food for those who hunger. "No one can miss the\nGod consciousness within," Swami Ram Tritha once said. It is true and I agree\nwith the Swami. It is the best work for self realization. In it, one will find\nthe answer to, who created this universe; the cause of and how to cure\ndiseases. It reveals the mastery of the Kundalini, the Mother of the Universe,\nand her power; how to perform levitation, and the secret of the long lived\nYogi. How to master mind, and control matter\n\np. 8\n\nand all the miseries of the world. In the story of Bali, it gives us\nencouragement and faith, that even a great egoist can attain liberation,--the\ngoal of the Yogi or the truth seeker.\n\nMore than a year ago, I was at Los Angeles and for the first time, heard that\nthe truth seekers were searching for this book.\n\nMany asked if I would get some copies of it, for them. I wrote to India and\nalso tried here, but was unable to find a copy. I then advertised in Europe\nbut could not find it there.\n\nA student of mine, in Los Angeles, brought a copy to my class but the owner\nrefused to part with it, even when offered thirty dollars. I then decided to\ntranslate this work for the truth-seeker.\n\nThe reader will find this work contains the records of spiritual truths, the\nsecret doctrine or eternal teaching of the Munis and Rishis, of India.\n\nThe ideals are wonderfully clear. They always begin on the gross and gradually\ntake the student to a higher and finer stage of self realization. They do that\nbecause the thought, at first,\n\np. 9\n\nis undeveloped, but step by step becomes finer and finer.\n\nThe Hindus in their attempt to find a solution to the problems of life and\ndeath in the external world, failed, as the nations of the West do to-day.\nThey found that the senses could not help them in the problems of life,\ntherefore, they gave up the external world and turned their attentions upon\nthe internal. They gave all their time to the study of the Atma, which gave\nthem finally, the solution of the problems of life and death. Their teachings\ngive us a glimpse of the Atma that is the Absolute. They found that the\nindividual soul is no other than the Brahma, Himself.\n\nThose readers who will follow closely the teachings of this work and\nconcentrate upon them will surely reach the goal "where the sun cannot shine,\nnor the moon nor the stars--the lightning cannot illumine, how can they? For\nwhen the Self shines, all shine."\n\nI have put here the way my Master taught me about this work, for the benefit\nof the truth-seeker.\n\np. 10\n\nIt is the guidance for the daily life. The work of the Great Master, who has\nit made so very easy, by illustrations.\n\nTHE AUTHOR.\n\n#### VRIDDHA CHANAKYA XV. 10\n\nThe list of books is long; mishaps arise  \nTo bar the student\'s progress; Life is brief;  \nWhatever, then, in books is best and chief.  \nThe essence, kernel--that attracts the wise.  \nJ. Muir--Metrical Translation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sri Ram, the Truth Seeker](yvhf03.htm)\n\n'
