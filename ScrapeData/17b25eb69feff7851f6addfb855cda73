(Brahman is the material cause) on account of (the Self) making itself;\n(which is possible) owing to modification.\n\nBrahman is the material cause for that reason also that Scripture--in the\npassage, 'That made itself its Self' (Taitt. Up. II, 7)--represents the Self\nas the object of action as well as the agent.--But how can the Self which as\nagent was in full existence previously to the action be made out to be at the\nsame time that which is effected by the action?--Owing to modification, we\nreply. The Self, although in full existence previously to the action, modifies\nitself into something special, viz. the Self of the effect. Thus we see that\ncausal substances, such as clay and the like, are, by undergoing the process\nof modification, changed into their products.--The word 'itself' in the\npassage quoted intimates the absence of any other operative cause but the\nSelf.\n\nThe word 'pari _n_ amat' (in the Sutra) may also be taken as constituting a\nseparate Sutra by itself, the sense of which would be: Brahman is the material\ncause of the world for that reason also, that the sacred text speaks of\nBrahman and its modification into the Self of its effect as co-ordinated, viz.\nin the passage, 'It became sat and tyat, defined and undefined' (Taitt. Up.\nII, 6).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 27](sbe34138.htm)\n\n"
