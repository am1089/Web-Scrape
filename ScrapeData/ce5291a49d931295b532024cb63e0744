I shall be big when I am as old as my\nfather is.\n\nMy teacher will come and say, "It is late, bring your slate and your books."\n\nI shall tell him, "Do you not know I am as big as father? And I must not have\nlessons any more."\n\nMy master will wonder and say, "He can leave his books if he likes, for he is\ngrown up."\n\nI shall dress myself and walk to the fair where the crowd is thick.\n\nMy uncle will come rushing up to me and say, "You will get lost, my boy; let\nme carry you."\n\nI shall answer, "Can\'t you see, uncle, I am as big as father. I must go to the\nfair alone."\n\nUncle will say, "Yes, he can go wherever he likes, for he is grown up."\n\nMother will come from her bath when I am giving money to my nurse, for I shall\nknow how to open the box with my key.\n\nMother will say, "What are you about, naughty child?"\n\nI shall tell her, "Mother, don\'t you know, I am as big as father, and I must\ngive silver to my nurse."\n\nMother will say to herself, "He can give money to whom he likes, for he is\ngrown up."\n\nIn the holiday time in October father will come home and, thinking that I am\nstill a baby, will bring for me from the town little shoes and small silken\nfrocks.\n\nI shall say, "Father, give them to my dada [ _elder brother_ ], for I am as\nbig as you are."\n\nFather will think and say, "He can buy his own clothes if he likes, for he is\ngrown up."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Twelve O\'clock](cm30.htm)\n\n'
