The chief difference between these two\nSutras, both belonging to the Taittiriya School of the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda,\nconsists herein, that \xc3\x82pastamba, just as has been stated above 1 with regard\nto Gobhila, gives only the rules for the performance of the G _ri_ hya rites\nwithout the Mantras, which are contained in a special collection, the Mantrapa\n_th_ a, standing by the side of the Sutras: Hira _n_ yake _s_ in, on the other\nhand, follows the more usual practice, as adopted by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana, Paraskara, of interweaving the description of the ceremonies with\nthe text of the corresponding Mantras. As to the relation in which the\n\xc3\x82pastambiya-sutras stand to the Mantrapa _th_ a, there is, so far as I can\nsee, no reason why we should not extend the theory which we have tried to\nestablish with regard to Gobhila, to the evidently parallel case of \xc3\x82pastamba:\nthe Sutras presuppose the existence of the Mantrapa _th_ a, just as the latter\ntext seems to presuppose the Sutras.\xc2\x97The questions regarding the historical\nrelation of \xc3\x82pastamba to Hira _n_ yake _s_ in have been treated of by\nProfessor Buhler in his Introduction to \xc3\x82pastamba's Dharma-sutra, S.B.E., vol.\nii, pp. xxiii seq.\n\nI have here to thank Dr. Winternitz, to whom we are indebted for an excellent\nedition of the \xc3\x82pastambiya-G _ri_ hya-sutra, for having placed at my disposal,\nbefore publication,\n\np. 250\n\nthe proof-sheets of his edition, and for lending me his copy of the Mantrapa\n_th_ a as well as of the commentary of Haradatta. The kindness of the same\nscholar has enabled me to make use of Professor Eggeling's copy of the first\npart of Sudar _s_ anarya's commentary and of his own copy of the second part\nof the same work.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[249:1](sbe30093.htm#fr_711) See above, pp. [3](sbe30003.htm#page_3) seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 1, 1](sbe30094.htm)\n\n"
