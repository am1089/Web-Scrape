And scripture also declares that (those performing works) are not\noverpowered (by passion and the like).\n\nThis Sutra points out a further indicatory mark fortifying the conclusion that\nworks co-operate towards knowledge. Scripture also shows that he who is\nfurnished with such means as Brahma _k_ arya, &c., is not overpowered by such\nafflictions as passion and the like. Compare the passage, \'That Self does not\nperish which they find out by Brahma _k_ arya\' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII,,";, 3).--It\nis thus a settled conclusion that sacrifices and so on are works incumbent on\nthe a _s_ ramas as well as co-operative towards knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 36](sbe38245.htm)\n\n'
