The Ri _s_ i Naraya _n_ a said :-- The eldest son of Svayambhuva,\nPriyavrata served always his father and was very truthful. He married the\ndaughter of the Prajapati Vis'va Karma, the exceedingly lovely and beautiful\nBarhi _s_ mati, resembling like him, adorned with modesty, good nature and\nvarious other qualifications. He begat ten sons, very spiritual and well\nqualified and one daughter named \xc3\x9brja _s_ vati. This daughter was the youngest\nof all. The names of the ten sons are respec-\n\n\n\np. 749\n\n\n\ntively :-- (1) \xc3\x82gnidhra, (2) Idhmajibha, (3) Jaj\xc3\xb1abahu, (4) Mahavira, (5)\nRukmas'ukra (Hira _n_ yareta), (6) Ghritapri _st_ ha, (7) Savana, (8)\nMedhatithi, (9) Vitihotra and (10) Kavi. The name \xc2\x93Agni\xc2\x94 was attached to each\nof the above names. Out of these ten, the three sons named Kavi, Savana, and\nMahavira were indifferent and dispassionate to the world. In due time, these\nbecame extremely free from all desires and they were proficient in \xc3\x82tmavidya\n(Self-Knowledge). They were all \xc3\x9brdhareta (of perpetual chastity; who has\nsubdued all their passions) and took gladly to the Paramahamsa Dharma.\nPriyavrata had by his other wife three sons, named Uttama, Tamasa, and\nRaivata. These were all widely known; each of them in due time became endowed\nwith great prowess and splendour and became the Lord of one Manvatara.\nPriyavrata, the son of Svayambhuva, the King-Emperor enjoyed with his sons and\nrelations, this earth for eleven Arvuda years; the wonder was this, that he\nlived so long and there was seen no decay in his strength as regards his body\nor his senses. Once on an occasion, the King observed that when the sun\nappeared on the horizon and got up, one part of the earth was illumined and\nthe remaining part was enveloped in darkness. Seeing this discrepancy, he\nthought over for a long time and exclaimed, \xc2\x93What! Will the Darkness be seen\nin my kingdom, while I am reigning? This can never be. I will stop this by my\nYogic powers.\xc2\x94 Thus thinking, the King Priyavrata mounted on a luminous\nchariot, as big as the Sun, to illumine the whole world and circumambulated\nround the earth seven times. Whatever portion of the earth was trodden by the\nwheel on each occasion, became an ocean. Thus the seven oceans had their\norigins. And the portion of the earth, that was included within the ruts,\nbecame the seven islands (Dvipas). 0 Child! Now hear about the seven Dvipas\nand the seven Oceans :-- The first is the Jambu Dvipa; the second is Plak _s_\na, the third is S'almali; the fourth is the Kus'a Dvipa; the fifth is\nKrauncha; the sixth is the S'aka Dvipa; and the seventh is the Pu _s_ kara\nDvipa. The second Dvipa Plak _s_ a is twice the first Jambu Dvipa and so on;\neach succeeding Dvipa is twice as large as its previous one. Now hear the\nnames of the oceans. The first ocean is named Ksaroda (the salt water ocean);\nthe second is Ik _s_ urasa (the sugarcane ocean); the third is Sura (the wine\nocean), the fourth is Ghritoda (the clarified butter ocean) the fifth is K _s_\niroda (the ocean of milk); the sixth is Dadhi Ma _nd_ a (the ocean of curds);\nand the seventh is that of the ordinary water. The Jambu Dvipa is surrounded\nby K _s_ ira Samudra. The King Priyavrata made his son \xc3\x82gnidhra, the lord of\nthis Dvipa. He gave to his Idhmajibha, the Plak _s_ a Dvipa surrounded by Ik\n_s_ u Sagara; so he gave to Jaj\xc3\xb1abahu the S'almali Dvipa surrounded by Sura\nSagara and he\n\n\n\np. 750\n\n\n\ngave the lordship of Kus'a Dvipa to Hira _n_ yareta. Then he gave to his\npowerful son Ghritapri _st_ ha the Krauncha Dvipa surrounded by K _s_ ira\nSamudra and to his son Medhatithi the S'aka Dvipa surrounded by Dadhima _nd_ a\nSagara. Finally he gave to his Vitihotra, the Pu _s_ kara Dvipa surrounded by\nthe ordinary water. Thus distributing duly amongst his sons, the separate\ndivisions of the earth, he married his daughter, the youngest \xc3\x9brjasvati to the\nBhagavan Us'ana. In the womb of \xc3\x9brjasvati the Bhagavan S'ukracharya had his\nfamous daughter Devayani. O Child! Thus giving the charge of each Dvipa to\neach of his sons and marrying his daughters to the worthy hands, he took to\nViveka (discrimination) and adopted the path of Yoga.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the narration of the family\nof Priyavrata in the Maha Pura _n_ am, S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 5](bk08ch05.htm)\n\n"
