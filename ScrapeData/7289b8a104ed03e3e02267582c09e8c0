I must know.\n\nClasping her pitcher to her waist mother went to fetch water from the village\nnear by.\n\nIt was noon. The children\'s playtime was over; the ducks in the pond were\nsilent.\n\nThe shepherd boy lay asleep under the shadow of the _banyan_ tree.\n\nThe crane stood grave and still in the swamp near the mango grove.\n\nIn the meanwhile the Sleep-stealer came and, snatching sleep from baby\'s eyes,\nflew away.\n\nWhen mother came back she found baby travelling the room over on all fours.\n\nWho stole sleep from our baby\'s eyes? I must know. I must find her and chain\nher up.\n\nI must look into that dark cave, where, through boulders and scowling stones,\ntrickles a tiny stream.\n\nI must search in the drowsy shade of the _bakula_ grove, where pigeons coo in\ntheir corner, and fairies\' anklets tinkle in the stillness of starry nights.\n\nIn the evening I will peep into the whispering silence of the bamboo forest,\nwhere fireflies squander their light, and will ask every creature I meet, "Can\nanybody tell me where the Sleep-stealer lives?"\n\nWho stole sleep from baby\'s eyes? I must know.\n\nShouldn\'t I give her a good lesson if I could only catch her!\n\nI would raid her nest and see where she hoards all her stolen sleep.\n\nI would plunder it all, and carry it home.\n\nI would bind her two wings securely, set her on the bank of the river, and\nthen let her play at fishing with a reed among the rushes and water-lilies.\n\nWhen the marketing is over in the evening, and the village children sit in\ntheir mothers\' laps, then the night birds will mockingly din her ears with:\n\n"Whose sleep will you steal now?"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Beginning](cm09.htm)\n\n'
