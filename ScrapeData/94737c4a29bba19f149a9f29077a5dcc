Now (follow the offences) causing loss of caste (pataniya), 1\n\n2\\. (Viz.) making voyages by sea, 2\n\np. 218\n\n3\\. Stealing the property of a Brahma _n_ a or a deposit,\n\n4\\. Giving false evidence regarding land,\n\n5\\. Trading with merchandise of any description (whether forbidden or not),\n\n6\\. Serving _S_ udras,\n\n7\\. Begetting a son on a female of the _S_ udra caste, 7\n\n8\\. And becoming thereby her son. 8\n\n9\\. (For those who have) committed one of these (offences the following\npenance is prescribed); 9\n\n10\\. 'They shall eat every fourth meal-time a little food, bathe at the time\nof the three libations (morning, noon, and evening), passing (the day)\nstanding and (the night) sitting. After the lapse of three years they throw\noff their guilt.' 10\n\n11\\. 'A Brahma _n_ a removes the sin which he committed by serving the black\nrace during one day and one night, if he bathes during three years at every\nfourth meal-time.' 11\n\np. 219\n\n12\\. Now (follow) the minor offences, entailing loss of caste (upapataka), 12\n\n13\\. (Viz.) intercourse with females who must not be approached (agamya, e.g.)\ncohabitation with the female friend of a female Guru, with the female friend\nof a male Guru, with an Apapatra woman, and a female outcast, following the\nprofession of medicine, sacrificing for many, living by (performances on) the\nstage, following the profession of a teacher of dancing, singing and acting,\ntending cows and buffalos, and similar (low occupations, as well as)\nfornication. 13\n\n14\\. The expiation (prescribed) for these (offences is) to live as an outcast\nduring two years. 14\n\np. 220\n\n15\\. Now (follow the offences) which make men impure (asu _k_ ikara), 15\n\n16\\. (Viz.) gambling, performing incantations, subsisting by gleaning corn\nthough one does not perform an Agnihotra, subsisting by alms after one has\nfinished one's studentship, living, after that has been finished, longer than\nfour months in the house of one's teacher, and teaching such a (person who has\nfinished his studentship), gaining one's livelihood by astrology and so forth.\n16\n\n17\\. But the expiation of these (offences is to perform penances) during\ntwelve months, during twelve fortnights, during twelve times ten days, during\ntwelve se'nnights, during twelve times three days, during twelve days, during\nsix days, during three days, during a day and a night, during one day, in\nproportion to the offence committed. 17\n\n18\\. Now outcasts shall live together and (together) fulfil their duties,\nsacrificing for each other, teaching each other, and marrying amongst each\nother. If they have begot sons, they shall say to them, 'Depart from among us;\nthus you will again reach the \xc3\x82ryas.' 18\n\n19\\. For the organs do not become impure together with the man.\n\n20\\. (The truth of) that may be learned from this (parallel case); a man\ndeficient in limbs begets a son who has the full number of limbs.\n\n21\\. Harita declares that this is wrong.\n\n22\\. For wives may be (considered) similar to the\n\np. 221\n\nvessel which contains the curds (for the sacrifice). If one makes impure milk\ncurdle in a milk-vessel and stirs it, the _S_ ish _t_ as do not use the (curds\nthus produced) for sacred rites.\n\n23\\. In like manner no intercourse can be held with that (offspring) which is\nproduced from impure seed.\n\n24\\. If they desire it, (they may perform) a penance,\n\n25\\. (Viz. in the case of males) the third part (of the penance prescribed)\nfor crimes causing loss of caste (pataniya); for females the third part (of\nthat). 25\n\n26\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'If he applies sesamum to any\nother purpose, but food, anointing, and charitable gifts, he will be born\nagain as a worm and, together with his ancestors, be plunged into the ordure\nof dogs.' 26\n\n27\\. He who sells sesamum, forsooth, sells his ancestors; he who sells rice,\nforsooth, sells his life; he who gives away his daughter, making a bargain,\nforsooth, sells portions of his spiritual merit.\n\n28\\. Grass and wood, in its natural state, may be sold. 28\n\n29\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Animals that have teeth in\none jaw only, as well as minerals excepting salt, and undyed thread, these, O\nBrahma _n_ a, are the goods which thou art permitted to sell.' 29\n\n30\\. (If he has committed) any offence excepting a 30\n\np. 222\n\nmortal sin (pataka) he may either give to a learned Brahma _n_ a (anu _k_ ana)\na hairy cow of brown or red-dish colour, after sprinkling her with clarified\nbutter and scattering black sesamum seeds over her;\n\n31\\. Or (he may offer burnt oblations), reciting the Kushma _n_ _d_ as, during\ntwelve days, 31\n\n32\\. '(Thus) he will be freed. from the guilt (of any crime that is) less\n(heinous) than the murder of a learned Brahma _n_ a.'\n\n33\\. If one is accused of a mortal sin (pataka), a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra (penance\nmust be performed by the accused). 33\n\n34\\. The accuser (shall perform) that (K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance during) a\nyear. 34\n\n35\\. 'He who during a year associates with an outcast, becomes (likewise) an\noutcast; not by sacrificing for _h_ im, by teaching him or by (forming) a\nmatrimonial (alliance with him), but by using the same carriage or seat.' 35\n\n36\\. The penance for eating impure substances is to fast until the entrails\nare empty. That is attained in seven (days and) nights. 36\n\np. 223\n\n37\\. (Subsisting on) water, milk, clarified butter, (and) fasting,--each for\nthree days,--(and taking the three fluids) hot, that is a Taptak _ri_ _k_ _kh_\nra penance. 37\n\n38\\. (Eating) during three days in the morning only, during the (next) three\ndays in the evening only, (subsisting) during (another) three days (on) food\ngiven unasked, and fasting during three days, (that is) a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra\npenance. 38\n\n39\\. (If the period of twelve days is divided into) three (periods of) four\ndays, that is the K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance of, women, children, and aged\nmen. 39\n\n40\\. If (observing the rule given) above one eats (at each meal) so much only\nas one can take at one (mouthful), that is an Atik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance.\n40\n\n41\\. (If one) subsists on water only, that is a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ratik _ri_ _k_\n_kh_ ra, the third (in the order of the K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penances). 41\n\n42\\. During a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance (the following rules must be\nfollowed, viz.) to bathe at morn, noon, and evening, 42\n\n43\\. To sleep on the ground,\n\n44\\. To wear one garment only, to shave the hair of the head, of the beard,\nand of the body, and to clip the nails.\n\n45\\. The same (rules apply) to women except (that referring to) shaving the\nhead.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[217:1](sbe1456.htm#fr_1077) **2**. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 7, 21, 7-11.\n\n[217:2](sbe1456.htm#fr_1078) Govinda explains samudrasa _m_ yanam, 'making\nvoyages by sea,' by 'voyaging by means of ships to another continent (dvipa).'\n\n[218:7](sbe1456.htm#fr_1079) The MSS. from Gu _g_ arat and the Dekhan read\ninstead of-this and the next Sutras, ya _s_ _k_ a _s_ udrayam abhipra _g_\nayate tadapatya _m_ _k_ a bhavati, 'and he who begets (offspring) on a _S_\nudra female, and thereby becomes her son.'\n\n[218:8](sbe1456.htm#fr_1080) Govinda explains the Sutra as a prohibition\nagainst allowing oneself to be adopted by a _S_ udra ( _s_ udraputrabhava _h_\n| tavaham putro 'smity upa _g_ ivanam).\n\n[218:9](sbe1456.htm#fr_1081) The Dekhan and Gu _g_ arat MSS. again have a\ndifferent reading, tesha _m_ to nisvesha _h_ , 'but the atonement of these\noffences (is as follows).'\n\n[218:10](sbe1456.htm#fr_1082) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 10. All the MSS. read in the\nlast pada 'tribhir varshais tad apahanti papam.' The correct reading is that\ngiven by \xc3\x82pastamba loc. cit., 'tribhir varshair apa papa _m_ nudante.'\n\n[218:11](sbe1456.htm#fr_1083) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 27, 11. Govinda explains the\nSutra as referring to cohabitation with a female of the 'black race.' By the\nlatter term he understands a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ali, adding that others believe p.\n219 a _S_ udra female to be intended. It is, however, more probable that\nBaudhayana took the verse to forbid twice-born men to serve _S_ udras.\n\n[219:12](sbe1456.htm#fr_1084) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 7, 21, 9.\n\n[219:13](sbe1456.htm#fr_1085) Gautama XXI, is. In explanation of the term\nagamya, a female who must not be approached,' Govinda quotes Narada XII,\n73-74, and he takes the four classes of females, who are specially mentioned,\nnot as examples illustrating the term agamya, but as not included in and\nadditional to the latter. Physicians and the other professional men enumerated\nare usually not mentioned among the upapatakins, but occur in the lists of\nthose whose gifts must not be accepted, and of those who defile the, company\nat a funeral dinner, e _g_. Vasish _th_ a III, 3; XIV, 2, 3, 11. The\nexpression 'sacrificing for many' (gramaya _g_ anam) appears to be a\ndescription of the so-called 'Ya _g_ amana V _ri_ tti, by which the modern Bha\n_t_ _t_ agis, or priests who officiate for hire, subsist. In explanation of\nthe term na _t_ ya _k_ aryata, 'following the profession of teaching dancing,\nmusic, and acting,' Govinda says that 'instruction in the works of Bharata, Vi\n_s_ akhila, and others' is intended. Baudhayana no doubt intends to forbid the\ninstruction of professional dancers and actors in actual works on their art,\nsuch as the na _t_ ya-sutras mentioned by Pa _n_ ini.\n\n[219:14](sbe1456.htm#fr_1086) 'To live as an outcast, i.e. to subsist by\nbegging.'--Govinda.\n\n[220:15](sbe1456.htm#fr_1087) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 7, 21, 12-19; I, 10, 29, 15.\n\n[220:16](sbe1456.htm#fr_1088) Govinda is probably right in asserting that the\nword _k_ a, 'and (so forth),' is intended to include other not-named offences.\n\n[220:17](sbe1456.htm#fr_1089) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 10, 29, 17-18.\n\n[220:18](sbe1456.htm#fr_1090)-23. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 10, 29, 8-14.\n\n[221:25](sbe1456.htm#fr_1091) I.e. males shall live, according to the rules\ngiven above in Sutras 10-11, during one year, and females during four months.\n\n[221:26](sbe1456.htm#fr_1092) Vasish _th_ a II, 30.\n\n[221:28](sbe1456.htm#fr_1093) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 7, 21, 2.\n\n[221:29](sbe1456.htm#fr_1094) The permission to sell 'stones' or minerals\ncontradicts Vasish _th_ a II, 24.\n\n[221:30](sbe1456.htm#fr_1095) Regarding the definition of the term 'anu _k_\nana,' see above, I, 11, 21, 13.\n\n[222:31](sbe1456.htm#fr_1096) Regarding the efficacy of the Kushma _n_ _d_ a\ntexts, see e _g_. Gautama XIX, 12; XXII, 36.\n\n[222:33](sbe1456.htm#fr_1097) Vasish _th_ a XXIII, 37-38.\n\n[222:34](sbe1456.htm#fr_1098) Vasish _th_ a XXIII, 39.\n\n[222:35](sbe1456.htm#fr_1099) Vasish _th_ a I, 22.\n\n[222:36](sbe1456.htm#fr_1100) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 27, 3-4; Vasish _th_ a XXIII,\n30. I follow here the Gu _g_ arat and Dekhan MSS., which read amedhyapra _s_\nane praya _s_ _k_ ittir naishpurishya _m_ tat saptaratre _n_ avapyate. M. and\nthe two MSS. of the commentary give amedhyapra _s_ ane praya _s_ _k_ ittam and\nleave the remainder out. The commentary states that the penance intended is\nthe Taptak _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra, described in the next Sutra. The parallel\npassages of \xc3\x82pastamba and others leave no doubt that the northern MSS. in this\ncase have preserved the older form of the text.\n\n[223:37](sbe1456.htm#fr_1101) Vasish _th_ a XXI, 21.\n\n[223:38](sbe1456.htm#fr_1102) Vasish _th_ a XXI, 20. M. and the two MSS. of\nthe commentary omit the word 'k _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra _h_ ' at the end of the\nSutra.\n\n[223:39](sbe1456.htm#fr_1103) Vasish _th_ a XXIII, 43.\n\n[223:40](sbe1456.htm#fr_1104) Vasish _th_ a XXIV, 2.\n\n[223:41](sbe1456.htm#fr_1105) Vasish _th_ a XXIV, 3. Govinda gives another\nexplanation of the word t _ri_ tiya _h_ , 'the third,' according to which it\nis to refer to the third tryaha _h_ , or 'period of three days.'\n\n[223:42](sbe1456.htm#fr_1106)-44. Vasish _th_ a XXIV, 4-5.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Adhyaya 2, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 3](sbe1457.htm)\n\n"
