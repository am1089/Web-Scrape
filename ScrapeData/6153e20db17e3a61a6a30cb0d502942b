And on account of the atoms having colour, &c., the reverse (of the Vai\n_s_ eshika tenet would take place); as thus it is observed.\n\nLet us suppose, the Vai _s_ eshikas say, all substances composed of parts to\nbe disintegrated into their parts; a limit will finally be reached beyond\nwhich the process of disintegration cannot be continued. What constitutes that\nlimit are the atoms, which are eternal (permanent), belong to four different\nclasses, possess the qualities of colour, &c., and are the originating\nprinciples of this whole material world with its colour, form, and other\nqualities.\n\nThis fundamental assumption of the Vai _s_ eshikas we declare to be groundless\nbecause from the circumstance of the atoms having colour and other qualities\nthere would follow the contrary of atomic minuteness and permanency, i. e. it\nwould follow that, compared to the ultimate cause, they are gross and non-\npermanent. For ordinary experience teaches that whatever things possess colour\nand other qualities are, compared to their cause, gross and non-permanent. A\npiece of cloth, for instance, is gross compared to the threads of which it\nconsists, and non permanent; and the threads again are non-permanent and gross\ncompared\n\np. 392\n\nto the filaments of which they are made up. Therefore the atoms also which the\nVai _s_ eshikas admit to have colour, &c. must have causes compared to which\nthey are gross and non-permanent. Hence that reason also which Ka _n_ ada\ngives for the permanence of the atoms (IV, 1, 1, 'that which exists without\nhaving a cause is permanent') does not apply at all to the atoms because, as\nwe have shown just now, the atoms are to be considered as having a cause.--The\nsecond reason also which Ka _n_ ada brings forward for the permanency of the\natoms, viz. in IV, 1, 4, 'the special negation implied in the term non-eternal\nwould not be possible 1' (if there did not exist something eternal, viz. the\natoms), does not necessarily prove the permanency of the atoms; for supposing\nthat there exists not any permanent thing, the formation of a negative\ncompound such as 'non-eternal' is impossible. Nor does the existence of the\nword 'non-permanent' absolutely presuppose the permanency of atoms; for there\nexists (as we Vedantins maintain) another permanent ultimate Cause, viz.\nBrahman. Nor can the existence of anything be established merely on the ground\nof a word commonly being used in that sense, since there is room for common\nuse only if word and matter are well-established by some other means of right\nknowledge.--The third reason also given in the Vai _s_. Sutras (IV, 1, 5) for\nthe permanency of the atoms ('and Nescience') is unavailing. For if we explain\nthat Sutra to mean 'the non-perception of those actually existing causes whose\neffects are seen is Nescience,' it would follow that the binary atomic\ncompounds also are permanent 2. And if we tried to escape from that difficulty\nby including (in the explanation of the Sutra as given above) the\nqualification 'there being absence of (originating) substances,'\n\np. 393\n\nthen nothing else but the absence of a cause would furnish the reason for the\npermanency of the atoms, and as that reason had already been mentioned before\n(in IV, 1, 1) the Sutra IV, 1, 5 would be a useless restatement.--Well, then\n(the Vai _s_ eshika might say), let us understand by 'Nescience' (in the\nSutra) the impossibility of conceiving a third reason of the destruction (of\neffects), in addition to the division of the causal substance into its parts,\nand the destruction of the causal substance; which impossibility involves the\npermanency of the atoms 1.--There is no necessity, we reply, for assuming that\na thing when perishing must perish on account of either of those two reasons.\nThat assumption would indeed have to be made if it were generally admitted\nthat a new substance is produced only by the conjunction of several causal\nsubstances. But if it is admitted that a causal substance may originate a new\nsubstance by passing over into a qualified state after having previously\nexisted free from qualifications, in its pure generality, it follows that the\neffected substance may be destroyed by its solidity being dissolved, just as\nthe hardness of ghee is dissolved by the action of fire 2.--Thus there would\nresult, from the circumstance of the atoms having colour, &c., the opposite of\nwhat the Vai _s_ eshikas mean. For this reason also the atomic doctrine cannot\nbe maintained.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[392:1](sbe34191.htm#fr_372) Our Vai _s_ eshika-sutras read 'pratishedhabhava\n_h_ ;' but as all MSS. of Sa _n_ kara have 'pratishedhabhava _h_ ' I have kept\nthe latter reading and translated according to \xc3\x82nandagiri's explanation:\nKaryam anityam iti karye vi _s_ eshato nityatvanishedho na syad yadi kara _n_\ne#py anityatvam ato# _n_ una _m_ kara _n_ ana _m_ nityateti sutrartha _h_.\n\n[392:2](sbe34191.htm#fr_373) Because they also are not perceptible; the\nternary aggregates, the so-called trasare _n_ us, constituting the minima\nperceptibilia.\n\n[393:1](sbe34191.htm#fr_374) As they have no cause which could either be\ndisintegrated or destroyed.\n\n[393:2](sbe34191.htm#fr_375) This according to the Vedanta view. If atoms\nexisted they might have originated from avidya by a mere pari _n_ ama and\nmight again be dissolved into avidya, without either disintegration or\ndestruction of their cause taking place.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 16](sbe34192.htm)\n\n"
