I (1-7) teaches that the soul, when passing out of the body at the time\nof death, remains invested with the subtle material elements (bhutasukshma)\nwhich serve as an abode to the pra _n_ as attached to the soul.\n\nAdhik. II (8-11) shows that, when the souls of those who had enjoyed the\nreward of their good works in the moon descend to the earth in order to\nundergo a new embodiment, there cleaves to them a remainder (anu _s_ aya) of\ntheir\n\np. lx\n\nformer deeds which determines the nature of the new embodiment.\n\nAdhik. III (12-21) discusses the fate after death of those whom their good\nworks do not entitle to pass up to the moon.\n\nAdhik. IV, V, VI (22; 23; 24-27) teach that the subtle bodies of the souls\ndescending from the moon through the ether, air, &c., do not become identical\nwith ether, air, &c., but only like them; that the entire descent occupies a\nshort time only; and that, when the souls finally enter into plants and so on,\nthey do not participate in the life of the latter, but are merely in external\ncontact with them.\n\n### P\xc3\x82DA II.\n\nAdhik. I (1-6) treats of the soul in the dreaming state. According to _S_ a\n_n_ kara the three first Sutras discuss the question whether the creative\nactivity ascribed to the soul in some scriptural passages produces things as\nreal as those by which the waking soul is surrounded, or not; Sutra 3 settles\nthe point by declaring that the creations of the dreaming soul are mere\n\'Maya,\' since they do not fully manifest the character of real objects. Sutra\n4 adds that dreams, although mere Maya, yet have a prophetic quality. Sutras 5\nand 6 finally reply to the question why the soul, which after all is a part of\nthe Lord and as such participates in his excellencies, should not be able to\nproduce in its dreams a real creation, by the remark that the soul\'s knowledge\nand power are obscured by its connexion with the gross body.\n\nThe considerably diverging interpretation given of this adhikara _n_ a by\nRamanu _g_ a has the advantage of more closely connecting the Sutras with each\nother. According to him the question is not whether the creations of a dream\nare real or not, but whether they are the work of the individual soul or of\nthe Lord acting within the soul. Sutras 1 and 2 set forth the purvapaksha. The\ncreations of dreams (are the work of the individual soul); for thus Scripture\ndeclares: \'And the followers of some _s_ akas declare (the\n\np. lxi\n\nsoul to be) a creator,\' &c. The third Sutra states the siddhanta view: \'But\nthe creations of dreams are Maya, i. e. are of a wonderful nature (and as such\ncannot be effected by the individual soul), since (in this life) the nature\n(of the soul) is not fully manifested.\' Concerning the word \'maya,\' Ramanu _g_\na remarks, \'maya _s_ abdo hy a _sk_ aryava _k_ i _g_ anaka _s_ ya kule _g_ ata\ndevamayeva nirmita ityadishu tatha dar _s_ anat.\' The three remaining Sutras\nare exhibited in the _S_ ri-bhashya in a different order, the fourth Sutra,\naccording to _S_ a _n_ kara, being the sixth according to Ramanu _g_ a. Sutras\n4 and 5 (according to Ramanu _g_ a\'s numeration) are explained by Ramanu _g_ a\nvery much in the same way as by _S_ a _n_ kara; but owing to the former\'s\nstatement of the subject-matter of the whole adhikara _n_ a they connect\nthemselves more intimately with the preceding Sutras than is possible on _S_ a\n_n_ kara\'s interpretation. In Sutra 6 (su _k_ aka _s_ _k_ a hi) Ramanu _g_ a\nsees a deduction from the siddhanta of the adhikara _n_ a, \'Because the images\nof a dream are produced by the highest Lord himself, therefore they have\nprophetic significance.\'\n\nAdhik. II teaches that in the state of deep dreamless sleep the soul abides\nwithin Brahman in the heart.\n\nAdhik. III (9) expounds the reasons entitling us to assume that the soul\nawakening from sleep is the same that went to sleep.--Adhik. IV (9) explains\nthe nature of a swoon.\n\nAdhik. V (11-21) is, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, taken up with the question\nas to the nature of the highest Brahman in which the individual soul is merged\nin the state of deep sleep. Sutra 11 declares that twofold characteristics\n(viz. absence and presence of distinctive attributes, nirvi _s_ eshatva and\nsavi _s_ eshatva) cannot belong to the highest Brahman even through its\nstations, i.e. its limiting adjuncts; since all passages which aim at setting\nforth Brahman\'s nature declare it to be destitute of all distinctive\nattributes.--The fact, Sutra 12 continues, that in many passages Brahman is\nspoken of as possessing distinctive attributes is of no relevancy, since\nwherever there are mentioned limiting adjuncts, on which all distinction\ndepends, it is specially stated\n\np. lxii\n\nthat Brahman in itself is free from all diversity; and--Sutra 13 adds--in some\nplaces the assumption of diversity is specially objected to.--That Brahman is\ndevoid of all form (Sutra 14), is the pre-eminent meaning of all Vedanta-texts\nsetting forth Brahman\'s nature.--That Brahman is represented as having\ndifferent forms, as it were, is due to its connexion with its (unreal)\nlimiting adjuncts; just as the light of the sun appears straight or crooked,\nas it were, according to the nature of the things he illuminates (15).--The B\n_ri_ hadara _n_ yaka expressly declares that Brahman is one uniform mass of\nintelligence (16); and the same is taught in other scriptural passages and in\nSm _ri_ ti (17).--At the unreality of the apparent manifoldness of the Self,\ncaused by the limiting adjuncts, aim those scriptural passages in which the\nSelf is compared to the sun, which remains one although his reflections on the\nsurface of the water are many (18).--Nor must the objection be raised that\nthat comparison is unsuitable, because the Self is not material like the sun,\nand there are no real upadhis separate from it as the water is from the sun;\nfor the comparison merely means to indicate that, as the reflected image of\nthe sun participates in the changes, increase, decrease, &c., which the water\nundergoes while the sun himself remains unaffected thereby, so the true Self\nis not affected by the attributes of the upadhis, while, in so far as it is\nlimited by the latter, it is affected by them as it were (19, 20).--That the\nSelf is within the upadhis, Scripture declares (21).\n\nFrom the above explanation of this important adhikara _n_ a the one given in\nthe Sri-bhashya differs totally. According to Ramanu _g_ a the adhikara _n_ a\nraises the question whether the imperfections clinging to the individual soul\n(the discussion of which has now come to an end) affect also the highest Lord\nwho, according to Scripture, abides within the soul as antaryamin.\n\'Notwithstanding the abode (of the highest Self within the soul) (it is) not\n(affected by the soul\'s imperfections) because everywhere (the highest Self is\nrepresented) as having twofold characteristics (viz. being, on one hand, free\nfrom all evil, apahatapapman, vi _g_ ara, vim _ri_ tyu, &c., and, on the other\nhand, endowed with all auspicious\n\np. lxiii\n\nqualities, satyakama, satyasa _m_ kalpa, &c.) (11).--Should it be objected\nthat, just as the soul although essentially free from evil--according to the\nPra _g_ apativakya in the _Kh_ andogya--yet is liable to imperfections owing\nto its connexion with a variety of bodies, so the antaryamin also is affected\nby abiding within bodies; we deny this because in every section of the chapter\nreferring to the antaryamin (in the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka) he is expressly\ncalled the Immortal, the ruler within; which shows him to be free from the\nshortcomings of the _g_ iva (12).--Some, moreover, expressly assert that,\nalthough the Lord and the soul are within one body, the soul only is\nimperfect, not the Lord (dva supar _n_ a sayu _g_ a sakhaya) (13).--Should it\nbe said that, according to the _Kh_ andogya, Brahman entered together with the\nsouls into the elements previously to the evolution of names and forms, and\nhence participates in the latter, thus becoming implicated in the sa _m_ sara;\nwe reply that Brahman, although connected with such and such forms, is in\nitself devoid of form, since it is the principal element (agent; pradhana) in\nthe bringing about of names and forms (according to \'aka _s_ o ha vai\nnamarupayor nirvahita\') (14).--But does not the passage \'satya _m_ _g \xc3\xb1_anam\nanantam brahma\' teach that Brahman is nothing but light (intelligence) without\nany difference, and does not the passage \'neti neti\' deny of it all qualities?\n--As in order, we reply, not to deprive passages as the one quoted from the\nTaittiriya of their purport, we admit that Brahman\'s nature is light, so we\nmust also admit that Brahman is satyasa _m_ kalpa, and so on; for if not, the\npassages in which those qualities are asserted would become purportless (15).\n--Moreover the Taittiriya passage only asserts so much, viz. the praka _s_\narupata of Brahman, and does not deny other qualities (16).--And the passage\n\'neti neti\' will be discussed later on.--The ubhayali _n_ gatva of Brahman in\nthe sense assigned above is asserted in many places _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti\n(17).--Because Brahman although abiding in many places is not touched by their\nimperfections, the similes of the reflected sun, of the ether limited by jars,\n&c., are applicable to it (18).--Should it be said that the illustration is\nnot an appropriate one, because the\n\np. lxiv\n\nsun is apprehended in the water erroneously only while the antaryamin really\nabides within all things, and therefore must be viewed as sharing their\ndefects (19); we reply that what the simile means to negative is merely that\nBrahman should, owing to its inherence in many places, participate in the\nincrease, decrease, and so on, of its abodes. On this view both similes are\nappropriate (20).--Analogous similes we observe to be employed in ordinary\nlife, as when we compare a man to a lion (21).\n\nSutras 22-30 constitute, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, a new adhikara _n_ a\n(VI), whose object it is to show that the clause \'not so, not so\' (neti neti;\nB _ri_ hadar.) negatives, not Brahman itself, but only the two forms of\nBrahman described in the preceding part of the chapter. Sutras 23-26 further\ndwell on Brahman being in reality devoid of all distinctive attributes which\nare altogether due to the upadhis. The last four Sutras return to the question\nhow, Brahman being one only, the souls are in so many places spoken of as\ndifferent from it, and, two explanatory hypotheses having been rejected, the\nconclusion is arrived at that all difference is unreal, due to fictitious\nlimiting adjuncts.\n\nAccording to Ramanu _g_ a, Sutras 22 ff. continue the discussion started in\nSutra 11. How, the question is asked, can the ubhayali _n_ gatva of Brahman be\nmaintained considering that the \'not so, not so\' of the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka\ndenies of Brahman all the previously mentioned modes (prakara), so that it can\nonly be called that which is (sanmatra)?--The reply given in Sutra 22 is that\n\'not so, not so\' does not deny of Brahman the distinctive qualities or modes\ndeclared previously (for it would be senseless at first to teach them, and\nfinally to deny them again 1), but merely denies the prak _ri_ taitavattva,\nthe previously stated limited nature of Brahman, i.e. it denies that Brahman\npossesses only the previously mentioned qualifications. With this agrees, that\nsubsequently to \'neti neti\' Scripture itself enunciates further qualifications\nof Brahman. That Brahman as stated\n\np. lxv\n\nabove is not the object of any other means of proof but Scripture is confirmed\nin Sutra 23, \'Scripture declares Brahman to be the non-manifest.\'--And the\nintuition (sakshatkara) of Brahman ensues only upon its sa _m_ radhana, i.e.\nupon its being perfectly pleased by the worshipper\'s devotion, as Scripture\nand Sm _ri_ ti declare (24).--That this interpretation of \'neti\' is the right\none, is likewise shown by the fact that in the same way as praka _s_ a,\nluminousness, _g \xc3\xb1_ana, intelligence, &c., so also the quality of being\ndifferentiated by the world (prapa _\xc3\xb1 k_avsish _t_ ata) is intuited as non-\ndifferent, i.e. as likewise qualifying Brahman; and that praka _s_ a, and so\non, characterise Brahman, is known through repeated practice (on the part of\n_ri_ shis like Vamadeva) in the work of sa _m_ radhana mentioned before (25).\n--For all these reasons Brahman is connected with the infinite, i.e. the\ninfinite number of auspicious qualities; for thus the twofold indications (li\n_n_ ga) met with in Scripture are fully justified (26).--In what relation,\nthen, does the a _k_ id vastu, i.e. the non-sentient matter, which, according\nto the b _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, is one of the forms of Brahman, stand to the\nlatter?--Non-sentient beings might, in the first place, be viewed as special\narrangements (sa _m_ sthanavisesha _h_ ) of Brahman, as the coils are of the\nbody of the snake; for Brahman is designated as both, i.e. sometimes as one\nwith the world (Brahman is all this, &c.), sometimes as different from it (Let\nme enter into those elements, &c.) (27).--Or, in the second place, the\nrelation of the two might be viewed as analogous to that of light and the\nluminous object which are two and yet one, both being fire (28).--Or, in the\nthird place, the relation is like that stated before, i.e. the material world\nis, like the individual souls (whose case was discussed in II, 3, 43), a part\n--a _ms_ a--of Brahman (29, 30).\n\nAdhik. VII (31-37) explains how some metaphorical expressions, seemingly\nimplying that there is something different from Brahman, have to be truly\nunderstood.\n\nAdhik. VIII (38-41) teaches that the reward of works is not, as _G_ aimini\nopines, the independent result of the works acting through the so-called\napurva, but is allotted by the Lord.\n\np. lxvi\n\n### P\xc3\x82DA III.\n\nWith the third pada of the second adhyaya a new section of the work begins,\nwhose task it is to describe how the individual soul is enabled by meditation\non Brahman to obtain final release. The first point to be determined here is\nwhat constitutes a meditation on Brahman, and, more particularly, in what\nrelation those parts of the Upanishads stand to each other which enjoin\nidentical or partly identical meditations. The reader of the Upanishads cannot\nfail to observe that the texts of the different _s_ akhas contain many\nchapters of similar, often nearly identical, contents, and that in some cases\nthe text of even one and the same _s_ akha exhibits the same matter in more or\nless varied forms. The reason of this clearly is that the common stock of\nreligious and philosophical ideas which were in circulation at the time of the\ncomposition of the Upanishads found separate expression in the different\npriestly communities; hence the same speculations, legends, &c. reappear in\nvarious places of the sacred Scriptures in more or less differing dress.\nOriginally, when we may suppose the members of each Vedic school to have\nconfined themselves to the study of their own sacred texts, the fact that the\ntexts of other schools contained chapters of similar contents would hardly\nappear to call for special note or comment; not any more than the circumstance\nthat the sacrificial performances enjoined on the followers of some particular\n_s_ akha were found described with greater or smaller modifications in the\nbooks of other _s_ akhas also. But already at a very early period, at any rate\nlong before the composition of the Vedanta-sutras in their present form, the\nVedic theologians must have apprehended the truth that, in whatever regards\nsacrificial acts, one _s_ akha may indeed safely follow its own texts,\ndisregarding the texts of all other _s_ akhas; that, however, all texts which\naim at throwing light on the nature of Brahman and the relation to it of the\nhuman soul must somehow or other be combined into one consistent systematical\nwhole equally valid for the followers of all Vedic schools. For, as we have\nhad occasion to remark above, while acts may be performed\n\np. lxvii\n\nby different individuals in different ways, cognition is defined by the nature\nof the object cognised, and hence can be one only, unless it ceases to be true\ncognition. Hence the attempts, on the one hand, of discarding by skilful\ninterpretation all contradictions met with in the sacred text, and, on the\nother hand, of showing what sections of the different Upanishads have to be\nviewed as teaching the same matter, and therefore must be combined in one\nmeditation. The latter is the special task of the present pada.\n\nAdhik. I and II (1-4; 5) are concerned with the question whether those vidyas,\nwhich are met with in identical or similar form in more than one sacred text,\nare to be considered as constituting several vidyas, or one vidya only. _S_ a\n_n_ kara remarks that the question affects only those vidyas whose object is\nthe qualified Brahman; for the knowledge of the non-qualified Brahman, which\nis of an absolutely uniform nature, can of course be one only wherever it is\nset forth. But things lie differently in those cases where the object of\nknowledge is the sagu _n_ am brahma or some outward manifestation of Brahman;\nfor the qualities as well as manifestations of Brahman are many. Anticipating\nthe subject of a later adhikara _n_ a, we may take for an example the so-\ncalled-- _S_ a _nd_ ilyavidya which is met with in _Kh_. Up. III, 14, again--\nin an abridged form--in B _ri_. Up. V, 6, and, moreover, in the tenth book of\nthe _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a (X, 6, 3). The three passages enjoin a\nmeditation on Brahman as possessing certain attributes, some of which are\nspecified in all the three texts (as, for instance, manomayatva, bharupatva),\nwhile others are peculiar to each separate passage (pra _n_ a _s_ ariratva and\nsatyasa _m_ kalpatva, for instance, being mentioned in the _Kh_ andogya\nUpanishad and _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a, but not in the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka\nUpanishad, which, on its part, specifies sarvava _s_ itva, not referred to in\nthe two other texts). Here, then, there is room for a doubt whether the three\npassages refer to one object of knowledge or not. To the devout Vedantin the\nquestion is not a purely theoretical one, but of immediate practical interest.\nFor if the three texts are to be held apart, there are three different\nmeditations to be gone through; if, on the\n\np. lxviii\n\nother hand, the vidya is one only, all the different qualities of Brahman\nmentioned in the three passages have to be combined into one meditation.--The\ndecision is here, as in all similar cases, in favour of the latter\nalternative. A careful examination of the three passages shows that the object\nof meditation is one only; hence the meditation also is one only,\ncomprehending all the attributes mentioned in the three texts.\n\nAdhik. III (6-8) discusses the case of vidyas being really separate, although\napparently identical. The examples selected are the udgithavidyas of the _Kh_\nandogya Upanishad (I, 1-3) and the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka Upanishad (I, 3),\nwhich, although showing certain similarities--such as bearing the same name\nand the udgitha being in both identified with pra _n_ a--yet are to be held\napart, because the subject of the _Kh_ andogya vidya is not the whole udgitha\nbut only the sacred syllabic Om, while the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka Upanishad\nrepresents the whole udgitha as the object of meditation.\n\nSutra 9 constitutes in _S_ a _n_ kara\'s view a new adhikara _n_ a (IV),\nproving that in the passage, \'Let a man meditate\' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 1, 1), the O\n_m_ kara and the udgitha stand in the relation of one specifying the other,\nthe meaning being, \'Let a man meditate on that O _m_ kara which,\' &c.--\nAccording to Ramanu _g_ a\'s interpretation, which seems to fall in more\nsatisfactorily with the form and the wording of the Sutra, the latter merely\nfurnishes an additional argument for the conclusion arrived at in the\npreceding adhikara _n_ a.--Adhik. V (10) determines the unity of the so-called\npra _n_ a-vidyas and the consequent comprehension of the different qualities\nof the pra _n_ a, which are mentioned in the different texts, within one\nmeditation.\n\nAdhik. VI comprises, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, the Sutras 11-13. The point\nto be settled is whether in all the meditations on Brahman all its qualities\nare to be included or only those mentioned in the special vidya. The decision\nis that the essential and unalterable attributes of Brahman, such as bliss and\nknowledge, are to be taken into account everywhere, while those which admit of\na more or less (as, for instance, the attribute of having joy for its head,\nmentioned\n\np. lxix\n\nin the Taitt. Up.) are confined to special meditations.--Adhik. VII (14, 15),\naccording to _S_ a _n_ kara, aims at proving that the object of Ka _th_ a. Up.\nIII, 10, 11 is one only, viz. to show that the highest Self is higher than\neverything, so that the passage constitutes one vidya only.--Adhik. VIII (16,\n17) determines, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, that the Self spoken of in Ait.\n\xc3\x82r. II, 4, 1, 1 is not a lower form of the Self (the so-called sutratman), but\nthe highest Self; the discussion of that point in this place being due to the\nwish to prove that the attributes of the highest Self have to be comprehended\nin the Aitareyaka meditation.\n\nAccording to Ramanu _g_ a the Sutras 11-17 constitute a single adhikara _n_ a\nwhose subject is the same as that of _S_ a _n_ kara\'s sixth adhikara _n_ a.\nSutras 11-13 are, on the whole, explained as by _S_ a _n_ kara; Sutra 12,\nhowever, is said to mean, \'Such attributes as having joy for its head, &c. are\nnot to be viewed as qualities of Brahman, and therefore not to be included in\nevery meditation; for if they were admitted as qualities, difference would be\nintroduced into Brahman\'s nature, and that would involve a more or less on\nBrahman\'s part.\' Sutras 14-17 continue the discussion of the passage about the\npriya _s_ irastva.--If priya _s_ irastva, &c. are not to be viewed as real\nqualities of Brahman, for what purpose does the text mention them?--\'Because,\'\nSutra 14 replies, \'there is no other purpose, Scripture mentions them for the\npurpose of pious meditation.\'--But how is it known that the Self of delight is\nthe highest Self? (owing to which you maintain that having limbs, head, &c.\ncannot belong to it as attributes.)--\' Because,\' Sutra 15 replies, \'the term\n"Self" (atma anandamaya) is applied to it.\'--But in the previous parts of the\nchapter the term Self (in atma pra _n_ amaya, &c.) is applied to non-Selfs\nalso; how then do you know that in atma anandamaya it denotes the real\nSelf?--\'The term Self,\' Sutra 16 replies, \'is employed here to denote the\nhighest Self as in many other passages (atma va idam eka, &c.), as we conclude\nfrom the subsequent passage, viz. he wished, \'May I be many.\'--But, an\nobjection is raised, does not the context show that the term \'Self,\' which in\nall the preceding\n\np. lxx\n\nclauses about the pra _n_ amaya, &c. denoted something other than the Self,\ndoes the same in anandamaya atman, and is not the context of greater weight\nthan a subsequent passage?--To this question asked in the former half of 17\n(anvayad iti _k_ et) the latter half replies, \'Still it denotes the Self,\nowing to the affirmatory statement,\' i.e. the fact of the highest Self having\nbeen affirmed in a previous passage also, viz. II, 1, \'From that Self sprang\nether.\'\n\nAdhik. IX (18) discusses a minor point connected with the pra _n_ asa _m_\nvada.--The subject of Adhik. X (19) has been indicated already above under\nAdhik. I.--Adhik. XI (20-22) treats of a case of a contrary nature; in B _ri_.\nUp. V, 5, Brahman is represented first as abiding in the sphere of the sun,\nand then as abiding within the eye; we therefore, in spite of certain counter-\nindications, have to do with two separate vidyas.--Adhik. XII (23) refers to a\nsimilar case; certain attributes of Brahman mentioned in the Ra _n_ aya-niya-\nkhila have not to be introduced into the corresponding _Kh_ andogya vidya,\nbecause the stated difference of Brahman\'s abode involves difference of vidya.\n--Adhik. XIII (24) treats of another instance of two vidyas having to be held\napart.\n\nAdhik. XIV (25) decides that certain detached mantras and brahma _n_ a\npassages met with in the beginning of some Upanishads--as, for instance, a\nbrahma _n_ a about the mahavrata ceremony at the beginning of the Aitareya-ara\n_n_ yaka--do, notwithstanding their position which seems to connect them with\nthe brahmavidya, not belong to the latter, since they show unmistakable signs\nof being connected with sacrificial acts.\n\nAdhik. XV (26) treats of the passages stating that the man dying in the\npossession of true knowledge shakes off all his good and evil deeds, and\naffirms that a statement, made in some of those passages only, to the effect\nthat the good and evil deeds pass over to the friends and enemies of the\ndeceased, is valid for all the passages.\n\nSutras 27-30 constitute, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, two adhikara _n_ as of\nwhich the former (XVI; 27, 28) decides that the shaking off of the good and\nevil deeds takes place-not, as\n\np. lxxi\n\nthe Kaush. Up. states, on the road to Brahman\'s world--but at the moment of\nthe soul\'s departure from the body; the Kaushitaki statement is therefore not\nto be taken literally.--The latter adhikara _n_ a (XVII; 29, 30) treats of the\ncognate question whether the soul that has freed itself from its deeds\nproceeds in all cases on the road of the gods (as said in the Kaush. Up.), or\nnot. The decision is that he only whose knowledge does not pass beyond the\nsagu _n_ am brahma proceeds on that road, while the soul of him who knows the\nnirgu _n_ am brahma becomes one with it without moving to any other place.\n\nThe _S_ ri-bhashya treats the four Sutras as one adhikara _n_ a whose two\nfirst Sutras are explained as by _S_ a _n_ kara, while Sutra 29 raises an\nobjection to the conclusion arrived at, \'the going (of the soul on the path of\nthe gods) has a sense only if the soul\'s freeing itself from its works takes\nplace in both ways, i.e. partly at the moment of death, partly on the road to\nBrahman; for otherwise there would be a contradiction \'(the contradiction\nbeing that, if the soul\'s works were all shaken off at the moment of death,\nthe subtle body would likewise perish at that moment, and then the bodiless\nsoul would be unable to proceed on the path of the gods). To this Sutra 30\nreplies, \'The complete shaking off of the works at the moment of death is\npossible, since matters of that kind are observed in Scripture,\' i. e. since\nscriptural passages show that even he whose works are entirely annihilated,\nand who has manifested himself in his true shape, is yet connected with some\nkind of body; compare the passage, \'para _m_ _g_ yotir upasampadya svena rupe\n_n_ abhinishpadyate sa tatra paryeti kri _d_ an ramamana _h_ sa svara _d_\nbhavati tasya sarveshu lokeshu kama _k_ aro bhavati.\' That subtle body is not\ndue to karman, but to the soul\'s vidyamahatmya.--That the explanation of the\n_S_ ri-bhashya agrees with the text as well as _S_ a _n_ kara\'s, a comparison\nof the two will show; especially forced is _S_ a _n_ kara\'s explanation of\n\'arthavattvam ubhayatha,\' which is said to mean that there is arthavattva in\none case, and non-arthavattva in the other case.\n\nThe next Sutra (31) constitutes an adhikara _n_ a (XVIII)\n\np. lxxii\n\ndeciding that the road of the gods is followed not only by those knowing the\nvidyas which specially mention the going on that road, but by all who are\nacquainted with the sagu _n_ a-vidyas of Brahman.--The explanation given in\nthe _S_ ri-bhashya (in which Sutras 31 and 32 have exchanged places) is\nsimilar, with the difference however that all who meditate on Brahman--without\nany reference to the distinction of nirgu _n_ a and sagu _n_ a--proceed after\ndeath on the road of the gods. (The _S_ ri-bhashya reads \'sarvesham,\' i.e. all\nworshippers, not \'sarvasam,\' all sagu _n_ a-vidyas.)\n\nAdhik. XIX (32) decides that, although the general effect of true knowledge is\nrelease from all forms of body, yet even such beings as have reached perfect\nknowledge may retain a body for the purpose of discharging certain offices.--\nIn the _S_ ri-bhashya, where the Sutra follows immediately on Sutra 30, the\nadhikara _n_ a determines, in close connexion with 30, that, although those\nwho know Brahman as a rule divest themselves of the gross body--there\nremaining only a subtle body which enables them to move--and no longer\nexperience pleasure and pain, yet certain beings, although having reached the\ncognition of Brahman, remain invested with a gross body, and hence liable to\npleasure and pain until they have fully performed certain duties.\n\nAdhik. XX (33) teaches that the negative attributes of Brahman mentioned in\nsome vidyas--such as its being not gross, not subtle, &c.--are to be included\nin all meditations on Brahman.--Adhik. XXI (34) determines that Ka _th_ a Up.\nIII, 1, and Mu. Up. III, 1, constitute one vidya only, because both passages\nrefer to the highest Brahman. According to Ramanu _g_ a the Sutra contains a\nreply to an objection raised against the conclusion arrived at in the\npreceding Sutra.--Adhik. XXII (35, 36) maintains that the two passages, B\n_ri_. Up. III, 4 and III, 5, constitute one vidya only, the object of\nknowledge being in both cases Brahman viewed as the inner Self of all.--Adhik.\nXXIII (37) on the contrary decides that the passage Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 2, 4, 6\nconstitutes not one but two meditations.--Adhik. XXIV (38) again determines\nthat the vidya of the True contained in B _ri_. Up. V, 4, 5, is one only--\nAccording to Ramanu _g_ a,\n\np. lxxiii\n\nSutras 35-38 constitute one adhikara _n_ a only whose subject is the same as\nthat of XXII according to _S_ a _n_ kara.\n\nAdhik. XXV (39) proves that the passages _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1 and B _ri_. Up. IV,\n4, 22 cannot constitute one vidya, since the former refers to Brahman as\npossessing qualities, while the latter is concerned with Brahman as destitute\nof qualities.--Adhik. XXVI (40, 41) treats, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, of a\nminor question connected with _Kh_. Up. V, 11 ff.--According to the _S_ ri-\nbhashya, Sutras 39-41 form one adhikara _n_ a whose first Sutra reaches\nessentially the same conclusion as _S_ a _n_ kara under 39. Sutras 40, 41\nthereupon discuss a general question concerning the meditations on Brahman.\nThe qualities, an opponent is supposed to remark, which in the two passages\ndiscussed are predicated of Brahman--such as va _s_ itva, satyakamatva, &c.--\ncannot be considered real (paramarthika), since other passages (sa esha neti\nneti, and the like) declare Brahman to be devoid of all qualities. Hence those\nqualities cannot be admitted into meditations whose purpose is final release.\n--To this objection Sutra 40 replies,\'(Those qualities) are not to be left off\n(from the meditations on Brahman), since (in the passage under discussion as\nwell as in other passages) they are stated with emphasis 1.\'--But, another\nobjection is raised, Scripture says that he who meditates on Brahman as\nsatyakama, &c. obtains a mere perishable reward, viz. the world of the\nfathers, and similar results specified in _Kh_. Up. VIII, 2; hence, he who is\ndesirous of final release, must not include those qualities of Brahman in his\nmeditation.--To this objection Sutra 41 replies, \'Because that (i. e. the free\nroaming in all the worlds, the world of the fathers, &c.) is stated as\nproceeding therefrom (i. e. the approach to Brahman which is final release) in\nthe case of (the soul) which has approached Brahman;\' (therefore a person\ndesirous of release, may include satyakamatva, &c. in his meditations.)\n\np. lxxiv\n\nAdhik. XXVII (42) decides that those meditations which are connected with\ncertain matters forming constituent parts of sacrificial actions, are not to\nbe considered as permanently requisite parts of the latter.--Adhik. XXVIII\n(43) teaches that, in a B _ri_. Up. passage and a similar _Kh_. Up. passage,\nVayu and Pra _n_ a are not to be identified, but to be held apart.--Adhik.\nXXIX (44-52) decides that the fire-altars made of mind, &c., which are\nmentioned in the Agnirahasya, do not constitute parts of the sacrificial\naction (so that the mental, &c. construction of the altar could optionally be\nsubstituted for the actual one), but merely subjects of meditations.\n\nAdhik. XXX (53,54) treats, according to _S_ a _n_ kara, in the way of\ndigression, of the question whether to the Self an existence independent of\nthe body can be assigned, or not (as the Materialists maintain).--According to\nthe _S_ ri-bhashya the adhikara _n_ a does not refer to this wide question,\nbut is concerned with a point more immediately connected with the meditations\non Brahman, viz. the question as to the form under which, in those\nmeditations, the Self of the meditating devotee has to be viewed. The two\nSutras then have to be translated as follows: \'Some (maintain that the soul of\nthe devotee has, in meditations, to be viewed as possessing those attributes\nonly which belong to it in its embodied state, such as _g_ \xc3\xb1at _ri_ tva and\nthe like), because the Self is (at the time of meditation) in the body.\'--The\nnext Sutra rejects this view, \'This is not so, but the separatedness (i. e.\nthe pure isolated state in which the Self is at the time of final release when\nit is freed from all evil, &c.) (is to be transferred to the meditating Self),\nbecause that will be 1 the state (of the Self in the condition of final\nrelease).\'\n\nAdhik. XXXI (55, 56) decides that meditations connected with constituent\nelements of the sacrifice, such as the udgitha, are, in spite of difference of\nsvara in the udgitha, &c., valid, not only for that _s_ akha in which the\nmeditation actually is met with, but for all _s_ akhas.--Adhik.\n\np. lxxv\n\n[paragraph continues] XXXII (57) decides that the Vai _s_ vanara Agni of _Kh_.\nUp. V, II ff. is to be meditated upon as a whole, not in his single parts.--\nAdhik. XXXIII (58) teaches that those meditations which refer to one subject,\nbut as distinguished by different qualities, have to be held apart as\ndifferent meditations. Thus the daharavidya, _S_ a _nd_ ilyavidya, &c. remain\nseparate.\n\nAdhik. XXXIV (59) teaches that those meditations on Brahman for which the\ntexts assign one and the same fruit are optional, there being no reason for\ntheir being cumulated.--Adhik. XXXV (60) decides that those meditations, on\nthe other hand, which refer to special wishes may be cumulated or optionally\nemployed according to choice.--Adhik. XXXVI (61-66) extends this conclusion to\nthe meditations connected with constituent elements of action, such as the\nudgitha.\n\n### P\xc3\x82DA IV.\n\nAdhik. I (1-17) proves that the knowledge of Brahman is not kratvartha, i.e.\nsubordinate to action, but independent.--Adhik. II (18-20) confirms this\nconclusion by showing that the state of the pravra _g_ ins is enjoined by the\nsacred law, and that for them vidya only is prescribed, not action.--Adhik.\nIII (21,22) decides that certain clauses forming part of vidyas are not mere\nstutis (arthavadas), but themselves enjoin the meditation.--The legends\nrecorded in the Vedanta-texts are not to be used as subordinate members of\nacts, but have the purpose of glorifying--as arthavadas--the injunctions with\nwhich they are connected (Adhik. IV, 23, 24).--For all these reasons the\nurdhvaretasa _h_ require no actions but only knowledge (Adhik. V, 25).--\nNevertheless the actions enjoined by Scripture, such as sacrifices, conduct of\ncertain kinds, &c., are required as conducive to the rise of vidya in the mind\n(Adhik. VI, 26, 27).--Certain relaxations, allowed by Scripture, of the laws\nregarding food, are meant only for cases of extreme need (Adhik. VII, 28-3l).\n--The a _s_ ramakarma _n_ i are obligatory on him also who does not strive\nafter mukti (Adhik. VIII,\n\np. lxxvi\n\n[paragraph continues] 32-35).--Those also who, owing to poverty and so on, are\nana _s_ rama have claims to vidya (Adhik. IX, 36-39).--An urdhvaretas cannot\nrevoke his vow (Adhik. X, 40).--Expiation of the fall of an urdhvaretas\n(Adhik. XI, 41, 42).--Exclusion of the fallen urdhvaretas in certain cases\n(Adhik. XII, 43).--Those meditations, which are connected with subordinate\nmembers of the sacrifice, are the business of the priest, not of the ya _g_\namana (Adhik. XIII, 44-46).--B _ri_. Up. III, 5, 1 enjoins mauna as a third in\naddition to balya and pa _nd_ itya (Adhik. XIV, 47-49).--By balya is to be\nunderstood a childlike innocent state of mind (Adhik. XV, 50).\n\nSutras 51 and 52 discuss, according to Ramanu _g_ a, the question when the\nvidya, which is the result of the means described in III, 4, arises. Sutra 51\ntreats of that vidya whose result is mere exaltation (abhyudaya), and states\nthat \'it takes place in the present life, if there is not present an obstacle\nin the form of a prabalakarmantara (in which latter case the vidya arises\nlater only), on account of Scripture declaring this (in various passages).\'--\nSutra 52, \'Thus there is also absence of a definite rule as to (the time of\norigination of) that knowledge whose fruit is release, it being averred\nconcerning that one also that it is in the same condition (i.e. of sometimes\nhaving an obstacle, sometimes not).-- _S_ a _n_ kara, who treats the two\nSutras as two adhikara _n_ as, agrees as to the explanation of 51, while,\nputting a somewhat forced interpretation on 52, he makes it out to mean that a\nmore or less is possible only in the case of the sagu _n_ a-vidyas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lix:1](sbe34004.htm#fr_19) Nanu bhrantabrahma _g_ ivavades#py avidyak _ri_\ntopadhibhedad bhogavyavasthadaya upapadyanta ata aha, abhasa eva _k_ a.
