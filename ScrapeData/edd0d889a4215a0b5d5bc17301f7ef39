Some of the advanced\nthinkers in Western countries are beginning to understand the importance of\nthis noble science and to explain the problems of existence by it; but modern\nphysiologists, anatomists, biologists, and medical practitioners are still\nuncertain as to the proper solution of these problems; the more they\ninvestigate, the more doubts arise in their minds. Within the last fifty years\nthe various researches in the different departments of science, such as\nphysics, chemistry, physiology,\n\np. 126\n\nand biology, have apparently ended in the conclusion that life is nothing but\nthe result of physical and chemical actions in the organic structure, that\nthere is no such thing as vital force distinct and separate from the physical\nand chemical forces which have been discovered in the scientist\'s laboratory.\n\nSome of the students of science are even anxiously waiting in the vain\nexpectation that some day they will hear of the discovery of a substance,\nartificially produced in the laboratory, which will live, move, grow,\nmultiply, and die like a particle of living matter. The majority of modern\nthinkers, in fact, hold that vitality is merely the result of the mechanical\nactivity of the organs; that life comes directly from dead matter, and obeys\nphysical, chemical, and mechanical laws; that a living animal is nothing but a\nmachine; and that all of his\n\np. 127\n\nactions whether of body or mind are purely mechanical. They say that a living\nprotoplasm is only a combination of certain chemical elements, subject to\nordinary chemical laws; that living and non-living are one; and that the\nliving comes directly from the non-living. According to these scientists a\nhuman being is no more than a mechanical resultant of certain chemical changes\ngoverned by the laws of physical nature. If, however, we ask them what force\nit is that determines these physical and mechanical modifications, what is the\npower that causes all these chemical changes in such numberless varieties,\nthey answer that they do not know.\n\nAre we really like machines, subject to mechanical laws and nothing more? Is\nour growth entirely due to the process of accretion and aggregation of matter\nin the non-living world? Are we merely some\n\np. 128\n\naccidental precipitation, deposition, or crystallization of atoms and\nmolecules which are governed by no power higher than the chemico-physical\nforces? Students of physiology now learn in their text-books this physico-\nchemical theory of the origin of life. They laugh at those who use such\nexpressions as "vital energy," "vital force," "vitality," or "life force," in\nthe sense of some power separate and distinct from the physico-chemical forces\nof nature. In fact, when they study physiology they throw aside all ideas of\nvitality or life force; they believe in a nature devoid of vitality or life,\nand try to explain the formation of brain cells, nerves, tissues, and the\nconstruction of the various organs of a living animal without recognizing the\nexistence of a vital agency. A reaction, however, has taken place recently in\nEurope, and a class of scientific thinkers\n\np. 129\n\nhas appeared, Dr. Lionel S. Beale being the most prominent, who, having found\nno satisfactory explanation of life through these theories, have, after closer\nobservation and experiment, come to the conclusion that there is a vital force\nentirely distinct from mechanical or physico-chemical forces, and which\nmanifests itself through living particles of matter.\n\nIt is true that the human body is a machine, but not like any machine made by\nman. It is a self-moving, self-regulating, and self-adjusting, vital machine\ngoverned by will-power and intelligence. It was produced by a germ of life\nwhich possessed vitality, and which had the capability of becoming conscious,\nof willing, thinking, and producing psychic activity, in which are included\nall emotions and thoughts belonging to a human being. By a germ of life is\nmeant that germ of\n\np. 130\n\nmatter or substance which contains the potentiality of life and mind. Although\nthe manifestation of this vital force depends upon organic structure, still it\nis not the same as any of the familiar forces known to us; it is not like\nheat, electricity, magnetism, or molecular attraction. On the contrary, it is\na force which governs and directs all these grosser physical forces. It is the\ndirector of the telegraphic current which notifies the energy of the muscle\nwhen and how to exert itself. It coordinates all automatic movements, controls\nthe system as a whole as well as in detail, and is itself the principle of\npurely animal life. The special organ through which it functions chiefly, and\nwhich has been constructed to differentiate it from other energies, to give it\na form and a purpose, and to afford it a vehicle of expression, is the spinal\nnerve of the vertebrate\n\np. 131\n\nand the equivalent organ in other animals.\n\nThis mysterious and invisible vital energy or vital force is called in\nSanskrit "Prana." That branch of the Science of Yoga which treats of this\nmysterious force, describing its origin and nature, and teaching how it can be\ncontrolled and utilized to produce wonderful results, is known as the Science\nof Prana. Ordinarily it is translated into English by the word "Breath," and\ncalled the "Science of Breath"; but Prana is not simple breath. In the\nUpanishads it is defined as the cause of all motion and life in both the\norganic and inorganic worlds. Wherever there is the slightest expression of\nmotion, life, or mind, from the smallest atom, or animalcule, or amoeba, or\nbioplasm, up to the largest solar system and the highest man, it is the\nmanifestation of the all-pervading force called Prana. It is one, yet appears\n\np. 132\n\nas manifold through its divers expressions. It is the mother of all forces,\npsychical, chemical, and physical. Vedanta Philosophy describes it as the\nultimate generalization of the multiple forces of nature. It is\nindestructible; the death of the form through which it manifests cannot\ndestroy it; but it must not be confounded with molecular attraction for it is\nmuch finer; it cannot be seen, touched, weighed, measured, or captured by any\nmeans.\n\nAccording to Vedanta, before the beginning of creation the unconditioned\ncausal state of the universe contained potential Prana; Vedanta does not make\nthe absurd statement that life has come from non-life. It does not admit that\nvital energy is the result of mechanical forces, but, on the contrary, tells\nus that it is a force which operates simultaneously with physico-chemical\nforces. They are all, in fact, expressions\n\np. 133\n\nof the one living energy of Prana. Although some of the modern scientific\nmonists acknowledge that all matter and force spring from a common source, or\nfrom one eternal energy, still at the same time they deny the existence of\nlife or vitality in that energy and declare that it is not living. They try to\nprove that life is the product of some kind of motion of dead matter; while\nVedanta teaches that all the phenomena of the universe have evolved out of the\none eternal substance which possesses Prana or cosmic vital force, cosmic\nmind, cosmic intelligence, and consciousness. These may be interdependent, but\nas they all exist in a human being, so the infinite variety of forces exist in\nthat one eternal living Being whose body is the universe.\n\nThe Science of Yoga claims that this Prana is the final cause of all the\nmanifested\n\np. 134\n\nforces of nature. Why does an atom move and vibrate? A scientist does not\nknow, but a Yogi says because of Prana. That force which produces vibration in\nan atom or a molecule is one of the expressions of the energy of Prana or the\ncosmic Life-principle. The same Prana appears as that power by which a germ of\nlife works on the physical plane, arouses motion in the molecules of its cells\nand builds up a suitable structure, repairs injuries and reproduces its kind.\nIt causes activity in a protoplasm, in a bioplasm or an amoeba, as well as in\nthe highest man. It is closely related to the mind, which includes all the\npsychic activities and intelligence displayed by that germ in the different\ngrades of its evolution. Vital power and mind are, indeed, two aspects of one\nPrana. A germ of life possesses mentality as well as vitality, and the\nphenomena of\n\np. 135\n\nthese two aspects are most intimately connected with one another. In the\nscience of Yoga the relation between mind and Prana is described as that of a\nhorse and a rider, Prana being the horse which the individual mind rides. The\nbody moves like an automobile carriage when it is propelled from within by the\nforce of Prana and guided by the driver of the intelligent mind. The activity\nof the mechanism of the body stops if Prana or vital force ceases to vibrate.\nAgain, when the vibration of Prana is arrested, the mind no longer operates on\nthe physical plane. It is for this reason that vital force or Prana is called\nthe medium through which the mind expresses its powers on the physical plane.\n\nThe animal organism is nothing but a mechanism for the manifestation of the\npowers of the soul. When the soul wishes to express certain powers on\n\np. 136\n\nthe material plane it creates through Prana some suitable organism to fulfill\nits desire. If the mental activities of any living creature change, the\norganic structure of the nerves and cells will also change. Various\nexperiments have been made by different scientists which clearly show that\nmental effort underlies all physiological conditions and organic functions. An\nabnormal activity of the mind will invariably give rise to certain\npathological conditions, because it will affect the vital action; and when the\nvital power, which gives life to every cell of the body, is influenced, the\ncells will begin to vibrate in a different manner; and the result will be\nabnormal activity in the cells of the organs, which in turn will produce\nvarious diseases. Conversely, when the vital activity is normal, the psychic\nfunction is also natural. The mind is just as much affected\n\np. 137\n\nby a diseased body as the physical system is disturbed by a diseased mind. He\nwho can regulate his mentalities knows how to preserve his vitality and keep a\nhealthy body; while he who has control over his vital functions understands\nthe secret of keeping a healthy mind. The man who is thus able to dominate\nboth body and mind is the master of himself, the king in his own conscious\ndomain. But he who is not the master of himself lives like a slave to passion,\nto sense-objects, to wealth, property, ambition, and all earthly desires.\nThose who do not know how to regulate their vital forces are always unhappy,\nfor they constantly suffer either mentally or physically.\n\nEvery irregular activity of the mind will produce chemical and physiological\nchange in the nerve centers, in the organs, and eventually in the whole body.\nThis can be\n\np. 138\n\nshown by analyzing the chemical properties of the secretions of different\norgans, and especially by analyzing the breath. If we analyze the breath of a\nperson who is strongly moved by anger or any other violent passion, we shall\nfind that his whole system is poisoned for the time being. By letting his\nbreath pass through a certain solution in a glass tube, we shall readily see\nthat distinct changes are produced in the solution. These variations,\nfurthermore, are only the outward signs of the internal modifications that\nhave taken place in the entire nervous system. It is, in fact, these organic\nchanges that modify the breath; but in a normal, healthy state of mind and\nbody the chemical solution will remain perfectly unchanged. The breathing is\nthen regular, deep, and strong. Every impulse of passion that takes possession\nof the mind, causes a corresponding\n\np. 139\n\nvariation in the respiratory functions; anger, hatred, or jealousy for\ninstance, are marked by short, quick breath, while thoughts of peace, of true\nhappiness, and of divine love produce long, deep breath.\n\nThere are various ways of learning the relation that exists between vital\nactivity and mentality. A Yogi says that all abnormal and diseased conditions\nof the body are caused directly by imperfect or weak expression of the vital\nenergy, and indirectly by improper mental activity. The curing of a disease,\ntherefore, means the removing of the obstacles which prevent the Prana from\nworking in an absolutely normal way. This can be done either by physical\nprocesses or by regulating the mental functions. A Yogi heals disease in\nhimself by increasing the vital action; by rousing the latent powers of the\nPrana, which is the source of all life force. He\n\np. 140\n\nknows how to fill his whole body, nay, every cell, with increased vitality. By\nregulating the polarity of the cells through the higher vibrations of Prana he\ngenerates a strong current of vibratory Prana, directs its course through the\ndisordered cells of his organs, and changes the structure of these cells by\ncreating a rapid circulation of the blood charged with the healing power of\nPrana, and sending it to the parts affected. In this way the cells are\nrestored to their normal condition and the disease is cured. The Yogi does\nthis consciously and in the most scientific manner with the help of breathing\nexercises accompanied by concentration. According to the Science of Yoga all\nnervous currents and all molecular motion in the brain cells and nerve centers\nare caused by this Prana. If the molecules of the cells be filled with a new\nand strong current of Prana or vital\n\np. 141\n\nforce, their vibration will be enormously increased; and this will enable them\nto throw off the impure matter that retarded their natural activity, and\nrecover their normal healthy condition.\n\nThe same Prana is also the propelling power in circulation. A Yogi says that\nthe vital energy is stored up in the nerve centers of the spinal cord. It is\nthe cause of the motion of the lungs, which in turn produces respiration; and\nrespiration is the cause of the circulation of the blood and of all other\norganic activity. Modern physiology tells us that every portion of our body,\nevery tissue and cell breathes; that the lung is nothing more than an\ninstrument in the respiratory process, the chemical operation, which is the\nessential part of this function, occurring elsewhere in the cells and tissues\nthemselves. The lung is only the door through which\n\np. 142\n\noxygen enters the system. The physiologists of the eighteenth century held\nquite different views; even the father of modern chemistry, Lavoisier himself\n(1743-1794), supposed that the main act of respiration took place in the\nlungs. What really happens is that oxygen, introduced into the lungs, filters\nthrough the thin walls of the pulmonary capillaries, where it finds in the red\ncorpuscles of the blood a substance called hemoglobin, with which it unites to\nform a compound known as oxy-hemoglobin. And a very unstable compound it is,\nfor throughout the tissues, in the capillary vessels of the whole body, oxygen\nis allowed to escape freely and to effect its work upon the cells. The blood,\ntherefore, is merely a vehicle. The "organic combustions" do not occur in the\nlungs, their seat being in the cells and tissues throughout the whole system.\n\np. 143\n\nPhysiological chemistry tells us that all things mineral, vegetable, and\nanimal, are mainly composed of four principal elements--oxygen, hydrogen,\ncarbon, and nitrogen. Of these oxygen is of the greatest importance, since it\nis the most widely diffused, constituting by weight one-fifth of the\natmosphere, eight-ninths of the ocean and all water, nearly one-half of solid\nrock and of every solid substance, and more than one-half of all vegetables\nand animals. If a man weighs one hundred and fifty pounds, one hundred and ten\nof his weight is oxygen. It is the chief cause of all activity in mechanical,\nchemical, muscular, and mental forces. The amount of energy or activity of an\nanimal is determined by the amount of oxygen he respires; and the degree of\nforce manifested in the human organism is in proportion to the rate at which\noxygen is introduced into\n\np. 144\n\nthe system. It is the first requisite of vital action. Without it all other\nmaterials of life will be of little avail; and the respiratory organs are the\nmedium through which it enters the system. The blood which has been once used\nin our bodies would be of no further service if it were not purified by the\nlungs. Ordinarily air when inhaled, contains 21 per cent oxygen, and when\nexhaled, 12 per cent, having lost 9 per cent. In a healthy adult man the\naverage pulsation is 75 in a minute and about two ounces of blood are driven\nby each pulsation from the heart to the lungs, or nine pounds and six ounces\nin a minute. The quantity of blood in the human body is considered to be about\none-fifth of the weight of the entire body, or twenty-eight pounds in a man\nweighing one hundred and forty pounds. The full quantity of blood in the\nsystem will, therefore, flow\n\np. 145\n\nthrough the lungs in the short period of three minutes; in other words, the\nvast amount of thirteen thousand five hundred pounds in every twenty-four\nhours.\n\nIt is well known now that as a rule only one-sixth of the full capacity of the\nlungs is used; if the remaining five-sixths were properly brought into play\nwho can say what marvellous results might not follow? Nature has not given\ncapacity to any organ without a purpose; and we are sure that, if every one\nwere to use the full capacity of his lungs, weak or diseased lungs would be a\nthing of the past. If we understand the science of breathing, we can develop\nour lung power to its utmost capacity; then by well-regulated breathing\nexercises we can purify every particle of matter in the cells of the organs,\nand with the help of the current of Prana can ultimately drive out all\nphysical weakness.\n\np. 146\n\nFaith-healers, mental-healers, and Christian Scientists cure disease without\ngiving drugs; the Yogis of India do the same, but in a more scientific manner.\nFaith-healers and Christian Scientists ask us to believe in a certain thing\nand to declare that we are not suffering. A Yogi says that we can get better\nand surer results if through breathing exercises we can control the Prana,\nincrease the vital current, and fill the whole system with the healing power\nof Prana. By polarizing the activity of the cells, and removing the obstacles\nthat prevent the proper manifestation of the vital current in those cells, we\nshall get rid of the disease. If mental-healers and faith-healers knew the\nsecret of controlling the Prana, they would have been undoubtedly more\nsuccessful in their attempts. Some among them are now beginning to take up\nbreathing exercises, and perhaps in time\n\np. 147\n\nthey will learn the truths contained in the wonderful science of breathing.\n\nGenerally people who know nothing of this science think that it teaches merely\nthe mechanical process of breathing in and out; but its province is much more\nextended, for it likewise shows how to control the Prana, how to increase the\nvitality of the system by generating new nerve currents of a higher order, how\nto polarize the vibration of the cells, and how to awaken those powers which\nlie dormant on the sub-conscious plane as well as in the nerve centers of the\nspine. It also tells us that when the powers begin to manifest, we rise above\nthe influences and changes to which ordinary mortals are subject. India is the\nonly country where from ancient times this science of breathing has been\ncarefully studied in all its aspects by the Yogis. Through centuries of\ninvestigation\n\np. 148\n\nthey discovered different methods of regulating the breath, following which\nmarvellous results, both mental and physical, could be obtained. Out of these\nvarious discoveries grew up the science of breathing, which, besides the\ncontrol of the breath, also explains what relation the process of respiration\nbears to Prana, and how, by harmonizing the vibrations of nerve cells with the\nhigher laws of life force, one gains mastery over Prana. This control of Prana\nbrings complete subjugation of all the forces which govern the mind and body.\n\nThe aim of a Yogi is to establish absolute harmony between his vital actions\nand his mental functions, to transcend all laws, to rise above the influence\nof all environmental conditions, and to be the supreme ruler of the mind and\nof the entire system. According to the Yogi, this perfect self-mastery\n\np. 149\n\nand consequent freedom do not come to one who [has](errata.htm#0) not learned\nthe secret of regulating the vital energy, and who has not acquired the power\nto direct it wherever it is needed. Before anyone can control this invisible\nvital force, he must know its principal seat in the body; he must learn where\nthis unseen king of physical activities is enthroned, who are his attendants,\nand how lie governs his kingdom.\n\nA Yogi says that the king or Prana resides with his attendants in the nerve\ncenters of the spinal column. These centers are the main stations where this\nvital force is stored. There are many centers in the spinal cord out of which\nproceed the motor and sensory nerves which cover the whole body, including its\norgans. All sensations and motions of the limbs depend upon these nerve\ncenters in the spinal column\n\np. 150\n\nand the brain. There are two currents which flow in and out of the brain\nthrough the spinal column and nerves; they are called afferent and efferent\ncurrents--in Sanskrit, "Ida" and "Pingala." They run through the anterior and\nposterior channels of the spinal cord, and these furnish the two paths over\nwhich the currents of Prana travel. The nervous energy itself being scattered\nthroughout the system, the only means of regulating it is by controlling the\nprincipal centers or stations in the spinal column. If, therefore, any one\nwishes to control the Prana, he must first learn to govern the chief stations\nthrough which it works. After studying the relation of these different centers\nthe Yogis found that there were six of primary importance. Those who wish to\nknow their names can refer to the volume on "Raja Yoga" by the Swami\nVivekananda.\n\np. 151\n\nAccording to the science of breath, the King of these six leading nerve\ncenters in the spinal cord is enthroned in the center opposite the thorax; it\nis the respiratory center and in Sanskrit bears the name "Anahata." It moves\nthe lungs, causes respiration, and gives activity to all the other centers,\nwhich are dependent on it. If the royal center is disturbed or vibrates\nabnormally, those which are subject to it, and through them the whole system\nwill act in a corresponding manner; and the result will be disease, organic\ntrouble, or continued ill-health. So long, however, as the royal center is in\na normal condition, the movement of the lungs which causes inspiration and\nexpiration will be regular. Therefore the Yogi who desires to subjugate the\nnerve centers first strives to gain control over the respiratory center. The\nscience of breathing teaches that, by\n\np. 152\n\nregulating the breath, the motion of the lungs and the functions of the whole\nnervous system can be regulated. It also says that, by controlling the nerve\ncenters in the spinal column, mastery over the currents flowing throughout the\nsystem, and ultimately over the mind itself, with its various dormant powers,\ncan be easily gained. If the mental powers that are now latent on the\nsubconscious plane can be aroused, all the experiences of past incarnations,\nand the impressions gathered during previous lives, will come up on the\nconscious plane and we shall remember them all.\n\nThe Yogis say that the great majority of people breathe irregularly and that\nthere are differences in the breathings of men and women. The causes of this\nirregular breathing are many--food, drink, fear, sickness, sorrow, nervous\nexcitement, passion,\n\np. 153\n\nanxiety. These do not affect the breath directly, but they do influence it\nindirectly by producing abnormal activity of Prana, first in the nerve\ncenters, then in the movement of the lungs, which expresses outwardly as\nirregular breathing. Hence irregularity of the breath is the external sign of\nabnormal action of the respiratory center in the spine.\n\nA Yogi whose respiratory center functions regularly and is under perfect\ncontrol is free from weakness, ill-health, and all disease. As, by controlling\nthe activity of Prana in the nerve centers, the movement of the lungs and the\nrespiration are regulated, so, conversely, by regulating the breath, the lungs\nand nerve centers will be controlled, for they work simultaneously. Those who\nare suffering from ill-health should devote especial attention to the study of\nthe science of breathing, as it is\n\np. 154\n\nabsolutely necessary to the building up of a healthy mind and a healthy body.\n\nThe chief aim of a Yogi is to observe his own nature closely and to learn\nclearly what forces are operating in his system, and what relation they bear\nto one another; for by gaining a complete knowledge of his own nature he will\ngain correct knowledge of the whole universe, since the laws that govern the\nhuman body are universal. All these laws are nothing but the modes in which\nPrana operates in nature. Therefore a Yogi seeks first to understand the\nindividual Prana and the vital laws which govern his own system.\n\nIn India this fact was recognized and the science of breathing was carefully\nstudied by the sages, who had no other ambition or purpose in life than to\nacquire knowledge for its own sake. They explained this science, practiced\nbreathing exercises\n\np. 155\n\n[paragraph continues] (noting the results), and instructed their pupils, but\nnot to make a profession of it, or to earn money, or to gain fame in society.\nOn the contrary, they refused to teach those who came to learn for\nprofessional ends; and it is because of this disinterestedness on their part\nthat the knowledge of the Yogis is so pure and unadulterated by ambition or\nselfish motives. They also realized the dangers which might arise from\nignorant practice of these exercises. Those who are studying under\ninexperienced teachers should be on their guard, for there is great risk in\nletting the nerve currents flow in a wrong direction. It may produce abnormal\nresults and may even end in mental disorder. Right breathing, on the contrary,\nbrings the greatest benefits to mankind when properly practiced; but if it is\nabused it must do a corresponding amount of harm, just\n\np. 156\n\nas any medicine will when improperly applied. As by studying Materia Medica a\nman cannot cure himself without the aid of a trained physician, so the mere\nstudy of Yoga cannot bring about truly good results unless it is carried on\nunder the guidance of an experienced Yogi. It should be remembered,\nfurthermore, that in a written book everything is not given, that each\nconstitution is different from every other, and that that which is helpful to\none may not be so to another.\n\nAnyone who practices faithfully, according to the instructions of an\nexperienced living teacher, will surely gain highly beneficial results both in\nmind and body. He will learn how to manufacture vital force and to increase\nthe vitality of his whole organism. He will be able to remove all impurities\nfrom his system and to overcome all abnormal and diseased conditions,\n\np. 157\n\nthat is, where decomposition and disorganization have not advanced too far. He\nwill likewise no longer be a victim to cold, chills, Grip, fever, rheumatism,\nstiffness of the joints or muscles, paralysis, and other ills; for he knows\nhow he can remove them by increasing the vibrations of Prana and thus giving\nnew life to the cells of the organs.\n\nEvery individual, whether old or young, man or woman, is bound to get some\nresult if the breathing exercises be practiced faithfully for six months. By\nbreathing exercises, however, is not meant here merely deep breathing, such as\nis taught by teachers of music, Delsarte, or physical culture. Deep breathing\nis very good for drawing a full supply or oxygen into the system, and\nundoubtedly has its value, especially for women who wear tight dresses. Many\nof the diseases from which they\n\np. 158\n\nsuffer are directly traceable to a lack of the adequate quantity of oxygen\nnecessary for organic combustion and for the maintenance of the activity of\nthe organs. The organs of many people in this country are undeveloped, or\nabnormally developed, because of the unnatural clothes worn; and for all such\ndeep breathing will be exceedingly beneficial. But too much of it is\ninjurious, as it inflates and strains the lungs, and, if continued, the\nincreased development of the tissues will after a time decay and produce\nvarious troubles. Those who are taking lessons in deep breathing from\ninexperienced teachers should stop to consider this. By breathing exercises we\nmean that process by which control over the motion of the lungs and of the\nnerve centers, as also, in the end, over the Prana or vital energy can be\nacquired.\n\nA Yogi declares that the practice of\n\np. 159\n\nbreathing will bring whatever result is desired, whether physical, psychical,\nor spiritual. He who has gained perfect control over his breath can suspend it\nfor hours, and through this generate a power in the system which will levitate\nthe body, even counteracting the tremendous force of gravitation. A Yogi\nconquers death by the control of Prana. There are many Yogis in India who can\ntell the exact moment when they will leave their bodies. They say, "I am going\nto depart on such a day at such an hour," and at the appointed time\nconsciously give up their bodies in the presence of many. There are some again\nwho can prolong life indefinitely, and can subsist for long periods without\ntaking any kind of solid or liquid food.\n\nWhen so much can be accomplished through the control of the vital energy of\n\np. 160\n\n[paragraph continues] Prana, it is not strange that these Masters say to the\nworld:\n\n"Oh, ye mortals, study the science of breathing; learn the secret of\ncontrolling Prana or the vital energy; strive diligently to regulate the\nbreath; for the control of Prana will bring all happiness, earthly and\nspiritual, and through it will come perfect health, mastery of the body, and\nthat Supreme Bliss which is eternal and everlasting.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Was Christ a Yogi?](hby11.htm)\n\n'
