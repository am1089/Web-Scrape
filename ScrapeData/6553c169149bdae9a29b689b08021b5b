There are only two points, which, it seems to me, can be\nproved satisfactorily, viz. the connection of the work with the Sama-veda and\na Gautama _K_ ara _n_ a, and its priority to the other four Dharma-sutras\nwhich we still possess. To go further appears for the present impossible,\nbecause very little is known regarding the history of the schools studying the\nSama-veda, and because the Dharma _s_ astra not only furnishes very few data\nregarding the works on which it is based, but seems also, though not to any\ngreat extent, to have been tampered with by interpolators.\n\nAs regards its origin, it was again Professor Max Muller, who, in the place of\nthe fantastic statements of a fabricated tradition, according to which the\nauthor of the Dharma _s_ astra is the son or grandson of the sage Utathya, and\nthe grandson or great-grandson of U _s_ anas or _S_ ukra, the regent of the\nplanet Venus, and the book possessed generally binding force in the second or\nTreta Yuga 1, first put forward a rational explanation which, since, has been\nadopted by all other writers on Sanskrit literature. He says, Hist. Anc.\nSansk. Lit., p. 134, 'Another collection of Dharma-sutras, which, however, is\nliable to critical doubts, belongs\n\np. l\n\nto the Gautamas, a _K_ ara _n_ a of the Sama-veda.' This assertion agrees with\nKumarila's statement, that the Dharma _s_ astra of Gautama and the G _ri_ hya-\nsutra of Gobhila were (originally) accepted (as authoritative) by the _Kh_\nandogas or Samavedins alone 1. Kumarila certainly refers to the work known to\nus. For he quotes in other passages several of its Sutras 2.\n\nThat Kumarila and Professor Max Muller are right, may also be proved by the\nfollowing independent arguments. Gautama's work, though called Dharma _s_\nastra or Institutes of the Sacred Law, closely resembles, both in form and\ncontents, the Dharma-sutras or Aphorisms on the Sacred Law, which form part of\nthe Kalpa-sutras of the Vedic schools of Baudhayana, \xc3\x82pastamba, and Hira _n_\nyake _s_ in. As we know from the _K_ ara _n_ avyuha, from the writings of the\nancient grammarians, and from the numerous quotations in the Kalpa-sutras and\nother works on the Vedic ritual, that in ancient times the number of Vedic\nschools, most of which possessed _S_ rauta, G _ri_ hya, and Dharma-sutras, was\nexceedingly great, and that the books of many of them have either been lost or\nbeen disintegrated, the several parts being torn out of their original\nconnection, it is not unreasonable to assume that the aphoristic law-book,\nusually attributed to the _Ri_ shi Gautama, is in reality a manual belonging\nto a Gautama _K_ ara _n_ a. This conjecture gains considerably in probability,\nif the fact is taken into account that formerly a school of Sama-vedis, which\nbore the name of Gautama, actually existed. It is mentioned in one of the\nredactions of the _K_ ara _n_ avyuha 3 as a subdivision of the Ra _n_ ayaniya\nschool. The Va _m_ sa-brahma _n_ a of the Sama-veda, also, enumerates four\nmembers of the Gautama family among the teachers who handed down the third\nVeda, viz. Gat _ri_ Gautama, Sumantra Babhrava\n\np. li\n\n[paragraph continues] Gautama, Sa _m_ kara Gautama, and Radha Gautama 1, and\nthe existing _S_ rauta and G _ri_ hya-sutras frequently appeal to the opinions\nof a Gautama and of a Sthavira Gautama 2. It follows, therefore, that at least\none, if not several Gautama _K_ ara _n_ as, studied the Sama-veda, and that,\nat the time when the existing Sutras of La _t_ yayana and Gobhila were\ncomposed, Gautama _S_ rauta and G _ri_ hya-sutras formed part of the\nliterature of the Sama-veda. The correctness of the latter inference is\nfurther proved by Dr. Burnell's discovery of a Pit _ri_ medha-sutra, which is\nascribed to a teacher of the Sama-veda, called Gautama 3.\n\nThe only link, therefore, which is wanting in order to complete the chain of\nevidence regarding Gautama's Aphorisms on the sacred law, and to make their\nconnection with the Sama-veda perfectly clear, is the proof that they contain\nspecial references to the latter. This proof is not difficult to furnish, For\nGautama has borrowed one entire chapter, the twenty-sixth, which contains the\ndescription of the K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ras or difficult penances from the\nSamavidhana, one of the eight Brahma _n_ as of the Sama-veda 4. The agreement\nof the two texts is complete except in the Mantras (Sutra 12) where\ninvocations of several deities, which are not usually found in Vedic writings,\nhave been introduced. Secondly, in the enumeration of the purificatory texts,\nXIX, 12, Gautama shows a marked partiality for the Sama-veda. Among the\neighteen special texts mentioned, we find not less than nine Samans. Some of\nthe latter, like the B _ri_ hat, Rathantara, _G_ yesh _th_ a, and\nMahadivakirtya chants, are mentioned also in works belonging to the _Ri_ _g_\n-veda and the Ya _g_ ur-veda, and are considered by Brahma _n_ as of all\nschools to possess great efficacy. But others, such as the Purushagati,\nRauhina, and Mahavaira _g_ a Samans, have hitherto not been met with anywhere\nbut in books belonging to the Sama-veda, and\n\np. lii\n\ndo not seem to have stood in general repute. Thirdly, in two passages, I, 50\nand XXV, 8; the Dharma _s_ astra prescribes the employment of five Vyah _ri_\ntis, and mentions in the former Sutra, that the last Vyah _ri_ ti is satyam,\ntruth. Now in most Vedic works, three Vyah _ri_ tis only, bhu _h_ , bhuva _h_\n, sva _h_ , are mentioned; sometimes, but rarely, four or seven occur. But in\nthe Vyah _ri_ ti Saman, as Haradatta points out 1, five such interjections are\nused, and satyam is found among them. It is, therefore, not doubtful, that\nGautama in the above-mentioned passages directly borrows from the Sama-veda.\nThese three facts, taken together, furnish, it seems to me, convincing proof\nthat the author of our Dharma _s_ astra was a Sama-vedi. If the only argument\nin favour of this conclusion were, that Gautama appropriated a portion of the\nSamavidhana, it might be met by the fact that he has also taken some Sutras\n(XXV, 1-6), from the Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. But his partiality for Samans as\npurificatory texts and the selection of the Vyah _ri_ tis from the Vyah _ri_\nti Saman as part of the Mantras for the initiation (1, 50), one of the holiest\nand most important of the Brahmanical sacraments, cannot be explained on any\nother supposition than the one adopted above.\n\nThough it thus appears that Professor Max Muller is right in declaring the\nGautama Dharma _s_ astra to belong to the Sama-veda, it is, for the present,\nnot possible to positively assert, that it is the Dharma-sutra of that Gautama\n_K_ ara _n_ a, which according to the _K_ ara _n_ avyuha quoted in the\nSabdakalpadruma of Radhakanta, formed a subdivision of the Ra _n_ aya _n_\niyas. The enumeration of four \xc3\x82 _k_ aryas, bearing the family-name Gautama, in\nthe Va _m_ sa-brahma _n_ a, and La _t_ yayana's quotations from two Gautamas,\nmake it not unlikely, that several Gautama _K_ ara _n_ as once existed among\nthe Sama-vedi Brahma _n_ as, and we possess no means for ascertaining to which\nour Dharma _s_ astra must be attributed. Further researches into the history\nof the schools of the Sama-veda must be awaited until we can do more. Probably\nthe living tradition of the Sama-vedis of\n\np. liii\n\n[paragraph continues] Southern India and new books from the South will clear\nup what at present remains uncertain.\n\nIn concluding this subject I may state that Haradatta seems to have been aware\nof the connection of Gautama's law-book with the Sama-veda, though he does not\nsay it expressly. But he repeatedly and pointedly refers in his commentary to\nthe practices of the _Kh_ andogas, and quotes the G _ri_ hya-sutra of the _G_\naiminiyas 1, who are a school of Sama-vedis, in explanation of several\npassages. Another southern author, Govindasvamin (if I understand the somewhat\ncorrupt passage correctly), states directly in his commentary on Baudhayana I,\n1, 2, 6, that the Gautamiya Dharma _s_ astra was originally studied by the\n_Kh_ andogas alone 2.\n\nIn turning now to the second point, the priority of Gautama to the other\nexisting Dharma-sutras, I must premise that it is only necessary to take into\naccount two of the latter, those of Baudhayana and Vasish _th_ a. For, as has\nbeen shown above in the Introduction to \xc3\x82pastamba, the Sutras of the latter\nand those of Hira _n_ yake _s_ in Satydsha _dh_ a are younger than\nBaudhayana's. The arguments which allow us to place Gautama before both\nBaudhayana and Vasish _th_ a are, that both those authors quote Gautama as an\nauthority on law, and that Baudhayana has transferred a whole chapter of the\nDharma _s_ astra to his work, which Vasish _th_ a again has borrowed from him.\n\nAs regards the case of Baudhayana, his references to Gautama are two, one of\nwhich can be traced in our Dharma _s_ astra. In the discussion on the peculiar\ncustoms prevailing in the South and in the North of India (Baudh. Dh. 1, 2,\n1-8) Baudhayana expresses himself as follows:\n\np. liv\n\n'1. There is a dispute regarding five (practices) both in the South and in the\nNorth.\n\n'2. We shall explain those (peculiar) to the South.\n\n'3. They are, to eat in the company of an uninitiated person, to eat in the\ncompany of one's wife, to eat stale food, to marry the daughter of a maternal\nuncle or of a paternal aunt.\n\n'4. Now (the customs peculiar) to the North are, to deal in wool, to drink\nrum, to sell animals that have teeth in the upper and in the lower jaws, to\nfollow the trade of arms and to go to sea.\n\n'5. He who follows (these practices) in (any) other country than the one where\nthey prevail commits sin.\n\n'6. For each of these practices (the rule of) the country should be\n(considered) the authority.\n\n'7, Gautama declares that this is false.\n\n'8. And one should not take heed of either (set of practices), because they\nare opposed to the tradition of those learned (in the sacred law 1).'\n\nFrom this passage it appears that the Gautama Dharma-sutra, known to\nBaudhayana, expressed an opinion adverse to the authoritativeness of local\ncustoms which might be opposed to the tradition of the _S_ ish _t_ as, i.e. of\nthose who really deserve to be called learned in the law. Our Gautama teaches\nthe same doctrine, as he says, XI, 20, 'The laws of countries, castes, and\nfamilies, which are not opposed to the (sacred) records, have also authority.'\n\np. lv\n\nAs clear as this reference, is the case in which Baudhayana has borrowed a\nwhole chapter of our Dharma _s_ astra. The chapter in question is the\nnineteenth, which in Gautama's work forms the introduction to the section on\npenances and expiation. It is reproduced with a number of various readings 1\nin the third Pra _s_ na of Baudhayana's Dharma-sutra, where it forms the tenth\nand last Adhyaya. Its contents, and especially its first Sutra which connects\nthe section on penances with the preceding ones on the law of castes and\norders, make it perfectly clear that its proper position can only be at the\nbeginning of the rules on expiation, not in the middle of the discussion, as\nBaudhayana places it 2. This circumstance alone would be sufficient to prove\nthat Baudhayana is the borrower, not Gautama, even if the name of the latter\ndid not occur in Baudhayana's Dharma-sutra. But the character of many of\nBaudhayana's readings, especially of those in Sutras 2, 10, 5 11, 13, and 15,\nwhich, though supported by all the MSS. and Govindasvamin's commentary, appear\nto have arisen chiefly through clerical mistakes or carelessness, furnishes\n\np. lvi\n\neven an additional argument in favour of the priority of Gautama's text. It\nmust, however, be admitted that the value of this point is seriously\ndiminished by the fact that Baudhayana's third Pra _s_ na is not above\nsuspicion and may be a later addition 1.\n\nAs regards Baudhayana's second reference to Gautama, the opinion which it\nattribute, to the latter is directly opposed to the teaching of our Dharma _s_\nastra. Baudhayana gives II, 2, 4, 16 the rule that a Brahma _n_ a who is\nunable to maintain himself by teaching, sacrificing, and receiving gifts, may\nfollow the profession of a Kshatriya, and then goes on as follows 2:\n\n'17. Gautama declares that he shall not do it. For the duties of a Kshatriya\nare too cruel for a Brahma _n_ a.'\n\nAs the commentator Govindasvamin also points out, exactly the opposite\ndoctrine is taught in our Dharma _s_ astra, which (VII, 6) explicitly allows a\nBrahma _n_ a to follow, in times of distress the occupations of a Kshatriya.\nGovindasvamin explains this contradiction by assuming that in this case\nBaudhayana 2 cites the opinion, not of the author of our Dharma _s_ astra, but\nof some other Gautama. According to what has been said above 3, the existence\nof two or even more ancient Gautama Dharma-sutras is not very improbable, and\nthe commentator may possibly be right. But it seems to me more likely that the\nSutra of Gautama (VII, 6) which causes the difficulty is an interpolation,\nthough Haradatta takes it to be genuine. My reason for considering it to be\nspurious is that the permission to follow the trade of arms is opposed to the\nsense of two other rules of Gautama. For the author states at the end of the\nsame chapter on times of distress, VII, 25, that 'even a Brahma _n_ a may take\nup arms when his life is in danger.' The meaning of these words can only be,\nthat a Brahma _n_ a must not fight under any other circumstances.\n\np. lvii\n\n[paragraph continues] But according to Sutra 6 he is allowed to follow the\noccupations of a Kshatriya, who lives by fighting. Again, in the chapter on\nfuneral oblations, XV, 18, those Brahma _n_ as 'who live by the use of the\nbow' are declared to defile the company at a funeral dinner. It seems to me\nthat these two Sutras, taken together with Baudhayana's assertion that Gautama\ndoes not allow Brahma _n_ as to become warriors, raise a strong suspicion\nagainst the genuineness, of VII. 6, and I have the less hesitation in\nrejecting the latter Sutra, as there are several other interpolated passages\nin the text received by Haradatta 1. Among them I may mention here the Mantras\nin the chapter taken from the Samavidhana, XXVI, 12, where the three\ninvocations addressed to Siva are certainly modern additions, as the old\nSutrakaras do not allow a place to that or any other Paura _n_ ic deity in\ntheir works. A second interpolation will be pointed out below.\n\nThe Vasish _th_ a Dharma-sutra. shows also two quotations from Gautama; and it\nis a curious coincidence that, just as in the case of Baudhayana's references,\none of them only can be traced in our Dharma _s_ astra. Both the quotations\noccur in the section on impurity, Vas. IV, where we read as follows ' 2:\n\n'33. If an infant aged less than two years, dies, or in the case of a\nmiscarriage, the impurity of the Sapi _n_ _d_ as (lasts) for three (days and)\nnights.\n\n'34. Gautama declares that (they become) pure at once (after bathing).\n\n'35. If (a person) dies in a foreign country and (his Sapi _n_ _d_ as) hear\n(of his death) after the lapse of ten days, the impurity lasts for one (day\nand) night.\n\n'36. Gautama declares that if a person who has kindled the sacred fire dies on\na journey, (his Sapi _n_ _d_ as) shall again\n\np. lviii\n\ncelebrate his obsequies, (burning a dummy made of leaves or straw,) and remain\nimpure (during ten days) as (if they had actually buried) the corpse.'\n\nThe first of these two quotations or references apparently points to Gautama\nDh. XIV, 44, where it is said, that 'if an infant dies, the relatives shall be\npure at once.' For, though Vasish _th_ a's Sutra 34, strictly interpreted,\nwould mean, that Gautama declares the relatives to be purified\ninstantaneously, both if an infant dies and if a miscarriage happens, it is\nalso possible to refer the exception to one of the two cases only, which are\nmentioned in Sutra 33. Similar instances do occur in the Sutra style, where\nbrevity is estimated higher than perspicuity, and the learned commentator of\nVasish _th_ a does not hesitate to adopt the same view. But, as regards the\nsecond quotation in Sutra 36, our Gautama contains no passage to which it\ncould possibly refer. Govindasvamin, in his commentary on the second reference\nto Gautama in Baudhayana's Dharma _s_ astra II, 2, 71, expresses the opinion\nthat this Sutra, too, is taken from the 'other' Gautama Dharma-sutra, the\nformer existence of which he infers from Baudhayana's passage. And curiously\nenough the regarding the second funeral -actually is found in the metrical V\n_ri_ ddha-Gautama 1 or Vaish _n_ ava Dharma- _s_ astra, which, according to\nMr. Vaman Shastri Islampurkar 2, forms chapters 94-115 of the A _s_ vamedha-\nparvan of the Mahabharata in a Malayalam MS. Nevertheless, it seems to me very\ndoubtful if Vasish _th_ a did or could refer to this work. As the same rule\noccurs sometimes in the _S_ rauta-sutras 3, I think it more probable that the\n_S_ rauta-sutra of the Gautama school is meant. And it is significant that the\nV _ri_ ddha-Gautama declares its teaching to be kalpa _k_ odita 'enjoined in\nthe Kalpa or ritual.'\n\nRegarding Gautama's nineteenth chapter, which appears in the Vasish _th_ a\nDharma _s_ astra as the twenty-second, I have\n\np. lix\n\nalready stated above that it is not taken directly from Gautama's work, but\nfrom Baudhayana's. For it shows most of the characteristic readings of the\nlatter. But a few new ones also occur, and some Sutras have been left out,\nwhile one new one, a well-known verse regarding the efficacy of the Vai _s_\nvanara vratapati and of the Pavitresh _t_ i, has been added. Among the\nomissions peculiar to Vasish _th_ a, that of the first Sutra is the most\nimportant, as it alters the whole character of the chapter, and removes one of\nthe most convincing arguments as to its original position at the head of the\nsection on penances. Vasish _th_ a places it in the beginning of the\ndiscussion on penances which are generally efficacious in removing guilt, and\nafter the rules on the special penances for the classified offences.\n\nThese facts will, I think, suffice to show that the Gautama Dharma _s_ astra\nmay be safely declared to be the. oldest of the existing works on the sacred\nlaw 1. This assertion must, however, not be taken to mean, that every single\none of its Sutras is older than the other four Dharma-sutras. Two\ninterpolations have already been pointed out above 2, and another one will be\ndiscussed presently. It is also not unlikely that the wording of the Sutras\nhas been changed occasionally. For it is a suspicious fact that Gautama's\nlanguage agrees closer with Pa _n_ ini's rules than that of \xc3\x82pastamba and\nBaudhayana. If it is borne in mind that Gautama's work has been torn out of\nits original connection, and from a school-book has become a work of general\nauthority, and that for a long time it has been studied by Pandits who were\nbrought up in the traditions of classical grammar, it seems hardly likely that\nit could retain much of its ancient peculiarities of language. But I do not\nthink that the interpolations and alterations can have affected the general\ncharacter of the book very much. It is too methodically planned and too\ncarefully arranged to admit of any very great changes. The fact, too, that in\n\np. lx\n\nthe chapter borrowed by Baudhayana the majority of the variae lectiones are\ncorruptions, not better readings, favours this view. Regarding the distance in\ntime between Gautama on the one hand, and Baudhayana and Vasish _th_ a on the\nother, I refer not to hazard any conjecture, as long as the position of the\nGautamas among the schools of the Sama-veda has not been cleared up. So much\nonly can be said that Gautama probably was less remote from Baudhayana than\nfrom Vasish _th_ a. There are a few curious terms and rules in which the\nformer two agree, while they, at the same time, differ from all other known\nwriters on Dharma. Thus the term bhikshu, literally a beggar, which Gautama 1\nuses to denote an ascetic, instead of the more common yati or sannyasin,\noccurs once also in Baudhayana's Sutra. The same is the case with the rule,\nIII, 13, which orders the ascetic not to change his residence during the\nrains. Both the name bhikshu and the rule must be very ancient, as the _G_\nainas and Buddhists have borrowed them, and have founded on the latter their\npractice of keeping the Vasso, or residence in monasteries during the rainy\nseason.\n\nAs the position of the Gautamas among the Saman schools is uncertain, it will,\nof course, be likewise inadvisable to make any attempt at connecting them with\nthe historical period of India. The necessity of caution in this respect is so\nobvious that I should not point it out, were it not that the Dharma _s_ astra\ncontains one word, the occurrence of which is sometimes considered to indicate\nthe terminus a quo for the dates of Indian works. The word to which I refer is\nYavana. Gautama quotes, IV, 21, an opinion of 'some,' according to which a\nYavana is the offspring of a _S_ udra male and a Kshatriya female. Now it is\nwell known that this name is a corruption of the Greek \xe1\xbc\xb8\xce\xb1\xcf\x9d\xcf\x89\xce\xbd, an Ionian, and\nthat in India it was applied, in ancient times, to the Greeks, and especially\nto the early Seleucids who kept up intimate relations with the first Mauryas,\nas well as later to the Indo-Bactrian and Indo-Grecian kings who from the\nbeginning of the second century B. C. ruled\n\np. lxi\n\nover portions of north-western India. And it has been occasionally asserted\nthat an Indian work, mentioning the Yavanas, cannot have been composed before\n300 B. C., because Alexander's invasion first made the Indians acquainted with\nthe name of-the Greeks. This estimate is certainly erroneous, as there are\nother facts, tending to show that at least the inhabitants of north-western\nIndia became acquainted with the Greeks about 200 years earlier 1. But it is\nnot advisable to draw any chronological conclusions from Gautama's Sutra, IV,\n21. For, as, pointed out in the note to the translation of Sutra IV, 18, the\nwhole section with the second enumeration of the mixed castes, IV, 17-21, is\nprobably spurious.\n\nThe information regarding the state of the Vedic literature, which the Dharma\n_s_ astra furnishes, is not very extensive. But some of the items are\ninteresting, especially the proof that Gautama knew the Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyaka, from which he took the first six Sutras of the twenty-fifth Adhyaya; the\nSamavidhana Brahma _n_ a, from which the twenty-sixth Adhyaya has been\nborrowed; and the Atharva _s_ iras, which is mentioned XIX, 12. The latter\nword denotes, according to Haradatta, one of the Upanishads of the Atharva-\nveda, which usually are not considered to belong to a high antiquity. The fact\nthat Gautama and Baudhayana knew it, will probably modify this opinion.\nAnother important fact is that Gautama, XXI, 7, quotes Manu, and asserts that\nthe latter declared it to be impossible to expiate the guilt incurred by\nkilling a Brahma _n_ a, drinking spirituous liquor, or violating a Guru's bed.\nFrom this statement it appears that Gautama knew an ancient work on law which\nwas attributed to Manu. It probably was the foundation of the existing Manava\nDharma _s_ astra 2. No other teacher on law, besides Manu, is mentioned by\nname. But the numerous references to the opinions of 'some' show that\nGautama's work was not the first Dharma-sutra.\n\np. lxii\n\nIn conclusion, I have to add a few words regarding the materials on which the\nsubjoined translation is based. The text published by Professor Stenzler for\nthe Sanskrit Text Society has been used as the basis 1. It has been collated\nwith a rough edition, prepared from my own MSS. P and C, a MS. belonging to\nthe Collection of the Government of Bombay, bought at Belgam, and a MS.\nborrowed from a Pu _n_ a _S_ astri. But the readings given by Professor\nStenzler and his division of the Sutras have always been followed in the body\nof the translation. In those cases, where the variae lectiones of my MSS.\nseemed preferable, they have been given and translated in the notes. The\nreason which induced me to adopt this course was that I thought it more\nadvisable to facilitate references to the printed Sanskrit text than to insist\non the insertion of a few alterations in the translation, which would have\ndisturbed the order of the Sutras. The notes have been taken from the above-\nmentioned rough edition and from my MSS. of Haradatta's commentary, called\nGautamiya Mitakshara, which are now deposited in the India Office Library,\nSansk. MSS. Buhler, Nos. 165-67.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xlix:1](sbe0203.htm#fr_81) Manu III, 19; Colebrooke, Digest of Hindu Law,\nPreface, p. xvii (Madras ed.); Anantaya _g_ van in Dr. Burnell's Catalogue of\nSanskrit MSS., (p. 57; Para _s_ ara, Dharma _s_ astra I, 22 (Calcutta ed.).\n\n[l:1](sbe0203.htm#fr_82) Tantravarttika, p. 179 (Benares ed.),\n![](img/i05000.jpg).\n\n[l:2](sbe0203.htm#fr_83) Viz.
