If a man has several wives of his own caste,\n\n[14. Nand. states that the self-immolation of widows (Sattee) is a specially\nmeritorious act, and not obligatory. Besides, he quotes several passages from\nother Smritis and from the B _ri_ hannaradiyapura _n_ a, to the effect that in\ncase the husband should have died abroad, a widow of his, who belongs to the\nBrahma _n_ a caste, may not commit herself to the flames, unless she can reach\nthe place, where his corpse lies, in a day; and that one who is in her\ncourses, or pregnant, or whose pregnancy is suspected, or who has an infant\nchild, is also forbidden to burn herself with her dead husband. English\nrenderings of all the texts quoted by Nand. may he found in Colebrooke's Essay\non the Duties of a Faithful Hindu Widow. See also above, XX, 39. Nand.,\narguing from a passage of Baudhayana, takes the particle va, 'or,' to imply\nthat the widow is at liberty to become a female ascetic instead of burning\nherself.\n\nXXVI. 2. M. IX, 86.--4. M.

(If he has several) wives of divers castes (he shall perform them) even\nwith the youngest wife if she is of the same caste as himself.\n\n3\\. On failure of a wife of his own caste (he shall perform them) with one\nbelonging to the caste next below his own; so also in cases of distress (i.e.\nwhen the wife who is equal in caste to him happens to be absent, or when she\nhas met with a calamity);\n\n4\\. But no twice-born man ever with a _S_ udra wife.\n\n5\\. A union of a twice-born man with a _S_ udra wife can never produce\nreligious merit; it is from carnal desire only that he marries her, being\nblinded by lust.\n\n6\\. Men of the three first castes, who through folly marry a woman of the\nlowest caste, quickly degrade their families and progeny to the state of _S_\nudras.\n\n7, If his oblations to the gods and manes and (his hospitable attentions) to\nguests are offered principally through her hands, the gods and manes (and the\nguests) will not eat such offerings, and he will not go to heaven.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXVII.](sbe07029.htm)\n\n"
