Having prepared food for the Fathers and having arranged southward-pointed\nDarbha grass as seats (for the Brahma _n_ as whom he is going to invite), he\ninvites an odd number of pure Brahma _n_ as who are versed in the Mantras,\nwith no deficient limbs, who are not connected with himself by consanguinity\nor by their Gotra or by the Mantras, (such as his teacher or his pupils).\n\n3\\. In feeding them he should not look at any (worldly) purposes.\n\n4. 4 Having put wood on the fire and strewn southward pointed and eastward-pointed Darbha grass around it, having prepared the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya in an \xc3\x82 _g_ ya pot over which he has laid one purifier, having sprinkled water round (the fire) from right to left, and put a piece of Udumbara wood on (the fire), he sacrifices with the (spoon called) Darvi which is made of Udumbara wood.\n\n5\\. Having performed the rites down to the \xc3\x82 _g_ yabhaga offerings, he\nsuspends his sacrificial cord over his right shoulder and calls the Fathers\n(to his sacrifice) with (the verse), 'Come hither, O Fathers, friends of Soma,\non your hidden, ancient paths, bestowing on us offspring and wealth and long\nlife, a life of a hundred autumns.'\n\np. 226\n\n6. 6 He sprinkles water in the same direction (i.e. towards the south) with (the verse), 'Divine waters, send us Agni. May our Fathers enjoy this sacrifice. May they who receive their nourishment every month bestow on us wealth with valiant heroes.'\n\n7. 7 Having performed the rites down to the Vyah _ri_ ti oblations with his sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, he suspends it over his right shoulder and sacrifices with (the following Mantras):\n\n'To Soma with the Fathers, svadha! Adoration! 'To Yama with the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras and\nwith the Fathers, svadha! Adoration!\n\n'With the waters that spring in the east and those that come from the north:\nwith the waters, the supporters of the whole world, I interpose another one\nbetween (myself and) my father. Svadha! Adoration!\n\n'I interpose (another one) through the mountains;\n\n'I interpose through the wide earth; through the sky and the points of the\nhorizon, through infinite bliss I interpose another one between (myself and)\nmy grandfather. Svadha! Adoration!\n\n'I interpose (another one) through the seasons, through days and nights with\nthe beautiful twilight. Through half-months and months I interpose another one\nbetween (myself and) my great-grandfather. Svadha! Adoration!'\n\nThen he sacrifices with their names: 'To N.N. svadha! Adoration! To N.N.\nsvadha! Adoration!'\n\np. 227\n\n'Wherein my mother has done amiss, abandoning her duty (towards her husband),\nmay my father take that sperm as his own; may another one fall off from the\nmother. Svadha! Adoration!'\n\nIn the same way a second and a third verse with the alteration of the Mantra,\n'Wherein my grandmother,' 'Wherein my great-grandmother.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[225:1](sbe30082.htm#fr_675) 10, 1.
