This \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka consists, as Rajendralal Mitra has\nshown in the Introduction to his edition of the work in the Bibliotheca\nIndica, of three portions. Out of its ten Prapa _th_ akas, the first six form\nthe \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka proper, or the Karma-ka _n_ _d_ a, as Saya _n_ a writes. Then\nfollow Prapa _th_ akas VII, VIII, and IX, forming the Taittiriyaka-upanishad;\nand lastly, the tenth Prapa _th_ aka, the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iki or Mahanaraya _n_\na-upanishad, which is called a Khila, and was therefore considered by the\nBrahmans themselves as a later and supplementary work.\n\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, in his commentary on the Taittiriyaka-upanishad, divides his work\ninto three Adhyayas, and calls the first _S_ iksha-valli, the second the\nBrahmananda-valli, while he gives no special name to the Upanishad explained\nin the third Adhyaya. This, however, may be due to a mere accident, for\nwhenever the division of the Taittiriyaka-upanishad into Vallis is mentioned,\nwe always have three 1, the\n\np. xxviii\n\n[paragraph continues] _S_ iksha-valli, the Brahmananda-valli, and the Bh _ri_\ngu-valli 1. Properly, however, it is only the second Anuvaka of the seventh\nPrapa _th_ aka which deserves and receives in the text itself the name of _S_\nikshadhyaya, while the rest of the first Valli ought to go by the name of Sa\n_m_ hita-upanishad 2, or Sa _m_ hiti-upanishad.\n\nSaya _n_ a 3, in his commentary on the Taittiriya-ara _n_ yaka, explains the\nseventh chapter, the _S_ ikshadhyaya (twelve anuvakas), as Sa _m_ hiti-\nupanishad. His commentary, however, is called _S_ iksha-bhashya. The same Saya\n_n_ a treats the eighth and ninth Prapa _th_ akas as the Varu _n_ y-upanishad\n4.\n\nThe \xc3\x82nanda-valli and Bh _ri_ gu-valli are quoted among the Upanishads of the\n\xc3\x82tharvana 5.\n\nAt the end of each Valli there is an index of the Anuvakas which it contains.\nThat at the end of the first Valli is intelligible. It gives the Pratikas,\ni.e. the initial words, of each Anuvaka, and states their number as twelve. At\nthe end of the first Anuvaka, we have the final words 'satyam vadishyami,' and\npa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _k_ a, i.e. five short paragraphs at the end. At the end of the\nsecond Anuvaka, where we expect the final words, we have the initial, i.e. _s_\niksham, and then pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a, i.e. five sections in the Anuvaka. At the end\nof the third Anuvaka, we have the final words, but no number of sections. At\nthe end of the fourth Anuvaka, we have the final words of the three sections,\nfollowed by one paragraph; at the end of the fifth Anuvaka, three final words,\nand two paragraphs, though the first paragraph belongs clearly to the third\nsection. In the sixth Anuvaka, we have the final words of the two Anuvakas,\nand one paragraph. In the seventh Anuvaka, there is the final word\n\np. xxix\n\nsarvam, and one paragraph added. In the eighth Anuvaka, we have the initial\nword, and the number of sections, viz. ten. In the ninth Anuvaka, there are\nthe final words of one section, and six paragraphs. In the tenth Anuvaka,\nthere is the initial word, and the number of paragraphs, viz. six. In the\neleventh Anuvaka, we have the final words of four sections, and seven\nparagraphs, the first again forming an integral portion of the last section.\nThe twelfth Anuvaka has one section, and five paragraphs. If five, then the\n_s_ anti would here have to be included, while, from what is said afterwards,\nit is clear that as the first word of the Valli is _s_ am na _h_ , so the last\nis vaktaram.\n\nIn the second Valli the index to each Anuvaka is given at the end of the\nValli.\n\n1st Anuvaka: pratika: brahmavid, and some other catchwords, idam, ayam, idam.\nNumber of sections, 21.  \n2nd Anuvaka: pratika: annad, and other catchwords; last word, pu _k_ _kh_ a.\nSections, 26.  \n3rd Anuvaka: pratika: pranam, and other catchwords; last word, pu _k_ _kh_ a.\nSections, 22.  \n4th Anuvaka: pratika: yata _h_ , and other catchwords; last word, pu _k_ _kh_\na. Sections, 18.  \n5th Anuvaka: pratika: vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anam, and other catchwords; last word, pu _k_\n_kh_ a. Sections, 22.  \n6th Anuvaka: pratika: asanneva, then atha (deest in Taitt. \xc3\x82r. 7). Sections,\n28.  \n7th Anuvaka: pratika: asat. Sections, 16.  \n8th Anuvaka: pratika: bhishasmat, and other catchwords; last word,\nupasa\xe1\xb9\x85kramati. Sections, 51.  \n9th Anuvaka: pratika: yata _h_ \\--kuta _s_ _k_ ana; then tam (deest in Taitt.\nAr.). Sections, 11.  \n    In the third Valli the Anukramani stands at the end.  \n1\\. The first word, bh _ri_ gu _h_ , and some other catchwords. Sections, 13.  \n2\\. The first word, annam. Sections, 12  \n3\\. The first word, pra _n_ am. Sections, 12.  \n4\\. The first word, manah.

The first words, anna _m_ na nindyat, pra _n_ a _h_ , _s_ ariram.\nSections, 11.  \n8\\. The first words, anna _m_ na pari _k_ akshita, apo _g_ yoti _h_. Sections,\n11.  \n9\\.

The last words of each\nsection are given for the tenth Anuvaka.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xxvii:1](sbe15005.htm#fr_23) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara (ed. Roer, p. 141) himself speaks of\ntwo Vallis, teaching the paramatma _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana (the _S_ iksha-valli has\nnothing to do with this), and Anquetil has Anandbli = \xc3\x82nanda-valli, and\nBharkbli = Bhrigu-valli.\n\n[xxviii:1](sbe15005.htm#fr_24) The third Valli ends with Bh _ri_ gur ity\nupanishat.\n\n[xxviii:2](sbe15005.htm#fr_25) See Taittiriyaka-upanishad, ed. Roer, p. 12.\n\n[xxviii:3](sbe15005.htm#fr_26) See M. M., Alphabetisches Verzeichniss der\nUpanishads, p. 144.\n\n[xxviii:4](sbe15005.htm#fr_27) The Anukrama _n_ i of the \xc3\x82treyi school (see\nWeber, Indische Studien, II, p. 208) of the Taittiriyaka gives likewise the\nname of Varu _n_ i to the eighth and ninth Prapa _th_ aka, while it calls the\nseventh Prapa _th_ aka the Samhiti, and the tenth Prapa _th_ aka the Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ ki-upanishad. That Anukramani presupposes, however, a different text, as\nmay be seen both from the number of Anuvakas, and from the position assigned\nto the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ki as between the Samhiti and Varuni Upanishads.\n\n[xxviii:5](sbe15005.htm#fr_28) See M.
