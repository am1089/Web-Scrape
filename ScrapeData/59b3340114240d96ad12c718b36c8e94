IX.\n\nDuties of the religious student, householder, hermit, and mendicant.\n\nAURVA continued.--"When the youth has been invested with the thread of his\ncaste, let him diligently prosecute the study of the Vedas, in the house of\nhis preceptor, with an attentive spirit, and leading a life of continence. He\nis to wait upon his Guru, assiduously observant of purificatory practices, and\nthe Veda is to be acquired by him, whilst he is regular in the performance of\nreligious rites. In the morning Sandhya he is first to salute the sun; in the\nevening, fire; and then to address his preceptor with respect. He must stand\nwhen his master is standing; move when he is walking; and sit beneath him when\nhe is seated: he must never sit, nor walk, nor stand when his teacher does the\nreverse. When desired by him, let him read the Veda attentively, placed before\nhis preceptor; and let him eat the food he has collected as alms, when\npermitted by his teacher 1. Let him bathe in water which has first been used\nfor his preceptor\'s ablutions; and every morning bring fuel and water, and\nwhatsoever else may be required.\n\n"When the scriptural studies appropriate to the student have been completed,\nand he has received dismissal from his Guru, let the regenerate man enter into\nthe order of the householder; and taking unto himself, with lawful ceremonies,\nhouse, wife, and wealth, discharge to the best of his ability the duties of\nhis station 2; satisfying the manes with funeral cakes; the gods with\noblations; guests with hospitality; the sages with holy study; the progenitors\nof mankind with progeny; the spirits with the residue of oblations; and all\nthe world with words of truth 3. A\n\np. 295\n\nhouseholder secures heaven by the faithful discharge of these obligations.\nThere are those who subsist upon alms, and lead an erratic life of self-\ndenial, at the end of the term during which they have kept house. They wander\nover the world to see the earth, and perform their ablutions, with rites\nenjoined by the Vedas, at sacred shrines: houseless, and without food, and\nresting for the night at the dwelling at which they arrive in the evening. The\nhouseholder is to them a constant refuge and parent: it is his duty to give\nthem a welcome, and to address them with kindness; and to provide them,\nwhenever they come to his house, with a bed, a seat, and food. A guest\ndisappointed by a householder, who turns away from his door, transfers to the\nlatter all his own misdeeds, and bears away his religious merit 4. In the\nhouse of a good man, contumely, arrogance, hypocrisy, repining, contradiction,\nand violence are annihilated: and the householder who fully performs this his\nchief duty of hospitality is released from every kind of bondage, and obtains\nthe highest of stations after death.\n\n"When the householder, after performing the acts incumbent on his condition,\narrives at the decline of life, let him consign his wife to the care of his\nsons, and go himself to the forests 5. Let him there subsist upon leaves,\nroots, and fruit; and suffer his hair and beard to grow, and braid the former\nupon his brows; and sleep upon the ground: his dress must be made of skin or\nof Ka\xc5\x9ba or Ku\xc5\x9ba grasses; and he must bathe thrice a day; and he must offer\noblations to the gods and to fire, and treat all that come to him with\nhospitality: he must beg alms, and present food to all creatures: he must\nanoint himself with such unguents as the woods afford; and in his devotional\nexercises he must be endurant of heat and cold. The sage who diligently\nfollows these rules, and leads the life of the hermit (or Vanaprastha),\nconsumes, like fire, all imperfections, and conquers for himself the mansions\nof eternity.\n\n"The fourth order of men is called that of the mendicant; the circumstances of\nwhich it is fit, oh king, that you should hear from me. Let the unimpassioned\nman, relinquishing all affection for wife, children,\n\np. 296\n\nand possessions, enter the fourth order 6. Let him forego the three objects of\nhuman existence (pleasure, wealth, and virtue), whether secular or religious,\nand, indifferent to friends, be the friend of all living beings. Let him,\noccupied with devotion, abstain from wrong, in act, word, or thought, to all\ncreatures, human or brute; and equally avoid attachment to any. Let him reside\nbut for one night in a village, and not more than five nights at a time in a\ncity; and let him so abide, that good-will, and not animosity, may be\nengendered. Let him, for the support of existence, apply for alms at the\nhouses of the three first castes, at the time when the fires have been\nextinguished, and people have eaten. Let the wandering mendicant call nothing\nhis own, and suppress desire, anger, covetousness, pride, and folly. The sage\nwho gives no cause for alarm to living beings need never apprehend any danger\nfrom them. Having deposited the sacrificial fire in his own person, the\nBrahman feeds the vital flame, with the butter that is collected as alms,\nthrough the altar of his mouth; and by means of his spiritual fire he proceeds\nto his own proper abode. But the twice-born man 7, who seeks for liberation,\nand is pure of heart, and whose mind is perfected by self-investigation,\nsecures the sphere of Brahma, which is tranquil, and is as a bright flame that\nemits not smoke."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[294:1](vp083.htm#fr_821) These directions are the same as those prescribed by\nManu, though not precisely in the same words. II. 175, et seq.\n\n[294:2](vp083.htm#fr_822) So Manu, III. 4, &c.\n\n[294:3](vp083.htm#fr_823) The great obligations, or, as Sir Wm. Jones terms\nthem, sacraments, the Mahayajnas, or great sacrifices, are, according to Manu,\nbut five; Brahmayajna, sacred study; Pitriyajna, libations to the manes;\nDevayajna, burnt-offerings to the gods; Baliyajna, offerings to all creatures;\nand Nriyajna, hospitality. III. 70, 71. The Prajapatiyajna, or propagation of\noffspring, and Satyayajna, observance of truth, are apparently later\nadditions.\n\n[295:4](vp083.htm#fr_824) This is also the doctrine of Manu, III. 100.\n\n[295:5](vp083.htm#fr_825) Manu, VI. 3, &c.\n\n[296:6](vp083.htm#fr_826) Manu, VI. 33, &c.\n\n[296:7](vp083.htm#fr_827) The text uses the term Dwijati, which designates a\nman of the three first castes. The commentator cites various authorities to\nprove that its sense should be Brahman only, who alone is permitted to enter\nthe fourth order.--\'Entrance into the fourth order is never for the Kshatriya\nand Vai\xc5\x9bya. Entrance into the fourth order is for Brahmans, according to\nSwayambhu. So says Dattatreya: "Let the Brahman proceed from his dwelling is\nalso the expression of Yama, Samvartta, and Baudhayana."\' But this is not the\ngeneral understanding of the law, nor was it originally so restricted\napparently. Manu does not so limit it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter X](vp084.htm)\n\n'
