Crowned with plant and tree,  \nAnd stood above the foamy* sea.  2b  \nThere with his lofty peaks apraised  \nBright as a hundred suns he blazed,  \nAnd crest and crag of burnished gold  \nFlashed on the flood that round him rolled,*  \n\np. 395  \n\nThe Vanar thought the mountain rose  \nA hostile bar to interpose,  \nAnd, like a wind-swept cloud, o\'erthrew  \nThe glittering mountain as he flew.  \nThen from the falling hill rang out  \nA warning voice and joyful shout.  \nAgain he raised him high in air  \nTo meet the flying Vanar there,  \nAnd standing on his topmost peak  \nIn human form began to speak: 1  \n\'Best of the Vanars\' noblest line,  \nA mighty task, O chief, is thine.  \nHere for a while, I pray thee, light  \nAnd rest upon the breezy height.  \nA prince of Raghu\'s line was he  \nWho gave his glory to the Sea, 2  \nWho now to Rama\'s envoy shows  \nHigh honour for the debt he owes.  \nHe bade me lift my buried head  \nUprising from my watery bed,  \nAnd woo the Vanar chief to rest  \nA moment on my glittering crest,  \nRefresh thy weary limbs, and eat  \nMy mountain fruits for they are sweet.  \nI too, O chieftain, know thee well;-  \nThree worlds thy famous virtues tell;  \nAnd none, I ween, with thee may vie  \nWho spring impetuous through the sky.  \nTo every guest, though mean and low.  \nThe wise respect and honour show;  \nAnd how shall I neglect thee, how  \nSlight the great guest so near me now?  \nSon of the Wind,\'tis thine to share  \nThe might of him who shakes the air;  \nAnd,--for he loves his offspring,--he  \nIs honoured when I honour thee.  \nOf yore, when Krita\'s age  3 was new,  \nThe little hills and mountains flew  \nWhere\'er they listed, borne on wings  \nMore rapid the feathered king\'s. 4  \nBut mighty terror came on all  \nThe Gods and saints who feared their fall.  \n\nAnd Indra in his anger rent  \nTheir pinions with the bolts he sent.  \nWhen in his ruthless fury he  \nLevelled his flashing bolt at me,  \nThe great-souled Wind inclined to save,  \nAnd laid me neath the ocean\'s wave.  \nThus by the favour of the sire  \nI kept my cherished wings entire;  \nAnd for this deed of kindness done  \nI honour thee his noble son.  \nO come, thy weary limbs relieve,  \nAnd honour due from me receive.\'  \n\'I may not rest,\' the Vanar cried;  \n\'I must not stay or turn aside.  \nYet pleased am I, thou noblest hill,  \nAnd as the deed accept thy will.\'  \n   Thus as he spoke he lightly pressed  \nWith his broad hand the mountain\'s crest.  \nThen bounded upward to the height  \nOf heaven, rejoicing in his might,  \nAnd through the fields of boundless blue,  \nThe pathway of his father, flew.  \nGods, saints, and heavenly bards beheld  \nThat flight that none had paralleled,  \nThen to the Nagas\' mother  1b came  \nAnd thus addressed the sun-bright dame:  \n\'See, Hauum\'an with venturous leap  \nWould spring across the mighty deep,-  \nA Viinar prince, the Wind-God\'s seed:  \nCome, Suras\'a, his course impede.  \nIn Rakshas form thy shape disguise,  \nTerrific, like a hill in size:  \nLet thy red eyes with fury glow,  \nAnd high as heaven thy body grow.  \nWith fearful tusks the chief defy.  \nThat we his power and strength may try.  \nHe will with guile thy hold elude,  \nOr own thy might, by thee subdued.\'  \n   Pleased with the grateful honours paid,  \nThe godlike dame their words obeyed,  \nClad in a shape of terror she  \nSprang from the middle of the sea,  \nAnd, with fierce accents that appalled  \nAll creatures, to the Vanar called:  \n\'Come, prince of Vanars, doomed to be  \nMy food this day by heaven\'s decree.  \nSuch boon from ages long ago  \nTo Brahma\'s favouring will I owe.\'  \n   She ceased, and Hanuman replied,  \nBy shape and threat unterrified:  \n\'Brave Rama with his Maithil spouse  \nLodged in the shade of Dandak\'s boughs.  \nThence Ravan king of giants stole  \nSita the joy of Rama\'s soul.  \n\np. 396  \n\nBy Rama\'s high behest to her  \nI go a willing messenger;  \nAnd never shouldst them hinder one  \nWho toils for Das\'aratha\'s son.  \nFirst captive Sita will I see,  \nAnd him who sent and waits for me,  \nThen come and to thy will submit,  \nYea, by my truth I promise it.\'  \n\'Nay, hope not thus thy life to save;  \nNot such the boon that Brahma gave.  \nEnter my mouth,\' was her reply,  \n\'Then forward on thy journey hie!\'  1  \n\n\'Stretch, wider stretch thy jaws,\' exclaimed  \nThe Vanar chief, to ire inflamed;  \nAnd, as the Rakshas near him drew,  \nTen leagues in height his stature grew.  \nThen straight, her threatening jaws between,  \nA gulf of twenty leagues was seen.  \nTo fifty leagues he waxed, and still  \nHer mouth grew wider at her will.  \nThen smaller than a thumb became,  \nShrunk by his power, the Vanar\'s frame.  2  \nHe leaped within, and turning round  \nSprang through the portal at a bound.  \nThen hung in air a moment, while  \nHe thus addressed her with a smile:  \n\'O Daksha\'s child,  3 farewell at last!  \nFor I within thy mouth have passed.  \nThou hast the gift of Brahma\'s grace:  \nI go, the Maithil queen to trace.\'  \nThen, to her former shape restored,  \nShe thus addressed the Vanar lord:  \n\'Then forward to the task, and may  \nSuccess and joy attend thy way!  \nGo, and the rescued lady bring  \nIn triumph to her lord and king.\'  \n\nThen hosts of spirits as they gazed  \nThe daring of the Vanar praised.  \nThrough the broad fields of ether, fast  \nGarud\'s royal self, he passed,  \nThe region of the cloud and rain,  \nLoved by the gay Gandharva train,  \nWhere mid the birds that came and went  \nShone Indra\'s glorious bow unbent,  \nAnd like a host of wandering stars  \nFlashed the high Gods\' celestial cars.  \nFierce Sinhika  1b who joyed in ill  \nAnd changed her form to work her will,  \nDescried him on his airy way  \nAnd marked the Vanar for her prey.  \n\'This day at length,\' the demon cried,  \n\'My hunger shall be satisfied,\'  \nAnd at his passing shadow caught  \nDelighted with the cheering thought.  \nThe Vanar felt the power that stayed  \nAnd held him as she grasped his shade,  \nLike some tall ship upon the main  \nThat struggles with the wind in vain.  \nBelow, above, his eye he bent  \nAnd scanned the sea and firmament.  \nHigh from the briny deep upreared  \nThe monster\'s hideous form appeared,  \n\'Sugriva\'s tale,\' he cried,\'is true:  \nThis is the demon dire to view  \nOf whom the Vanar monarch told,  \nWhose grasp a passing shade can hold.\'  \nThen, as a cloud in rain-time grows.  \nHis form, dilating, swelled and rose.  \nWide as the space from heaven to hell  \nHer jaws she opened with a yell,  \nAnd rushed upon her fancied prey  \nWith cloud-like roar to seize and slay.  \nThe Vanar swift as thought compressed  \nHis borrowed bulk of limb and chest,  \nAnd stood with one quick bound inside  \nThe monstrous mouth she opened wide.  \nHid like the moon when Rahu  2b draws  \nThe orb within his ravening jaws.  \nWithin that ample cavern pent  \nThe demon\'s form he tore and rent,  \nAnd, from the mangled carcass freed,  \nCame forth again with thought-like speed.  3b  \n\np. 397  \n\nThus with his skill the fiend he slew,  \nThen to his wonted stature grew.  \nThe spirits saw the demon die.  \nAnd hailed the Vanar from the sky:  \n\'Well hast thou fought a wondrous fight  \nNor spared the fiend\'s terrific might,  \nOn, on! perform the blameless deed,  \nAnd in thine every wish succeed.  \nNe\'re can they fail in whom combine  \nSuch valour; thought, and skill as thine.\'  \n\nPleased with their praises as they sang,  \nAgain through fields of air he sprang,  \nAnd now, his travail wellnigh done,  \nThe distint shore was almost won,  \nBefore him on the margent stood  \nIn long dark line a waving wood,  \nAnd the fair island, bright and green  \nWith flowers and trees, was clearly seen,  \nAnd every babbling brook that gave  \nHer lord the sea a tribute wave.  \nHe lighted down on Lamba\'s peak  \nWhich tinted metals stain and streak,  \nAnd looked where Lanka\'s splendid town  \nShone on the mountain like a crown.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[394:1](ry343.htm#fr_789) This Book is called Sundar or the Beatiful. To a\nEuropean taste it is the most intolerably tedious of the whole poem, abounding\nin repetition, overloaded description, and long aud useless speeches which\nimpede the action of the poem. Manifest interpolations of whole Cantos also\noccur. I have omitted none of the action of the Book, but have occasionally\nomitted long passages of common-place description, lamentation, and long\nstories which have been again and again repeated.\n\n[394:2](ry344.htm#fr_790) Brahma the Self-Existent.\n\n[394:1b](ry344.htm#fr_791) Mainaka was the son of Rimalaya* and Mena or\nMenaka.\n\n[394:2b](ry344.htm#fr_792) Thus Milton makes the hills of heaven self-moving\nat command:\n\n\'At his comma*d the uprooted hiils retired Each to his place, they heard his\nvoice and went Obsequious\'\n\n[395:1](ry344.htm#fr_793) The spirit of the mountain is separable from the\nmountain. Himalaya has also been represented as standing in human on one of\nhis own peaks.\n\n[395:2](ry344.htm#fr_794) Sagar or the Sea is said to have derived its name\nfrom Sagar. The story is fully told in Book I, Cantos XLII, XLIII, and XLlV.\n\n[395:3](ry344.htm#fr_795) Kritu is the first of the four ages of the world,\nthe golden age, also called Satya.\n\n[395:4](ry344.htm#fr_796) _Parvata_ means a mountain and in the Vedas a cloud.\nHence in later mythology the mountain have taken the place of the clouds as\nthe objects of the attacks of Indra the Sun-God. The feathered king is Garuda.\n\n[395:1b](ry344.htm#fr_797) "The children of Surasa were a thousand mighty\nmany-headed serpents, traversing the sky."

Given the power as in Milton the result in Valmiki is\nperfectly consistent.\n\n[396:3](ry344.htm#fr_800) "Daksha is the son of Brahma and one of the\nPrajapatis or divine progenitors. He had sixty daughters, twenty-seven of whom\nmarried to Kas\'yapa produced, according to one of the Indian cosmogonies, all\nmundane beings. Does the epithet, Descendant of Daksha, given to Surasa, mean\nthat she is one of those daughters? I think not. This epithet is perhaps an\nappellation common to all created beings as having sprung from Daksha."\nGORRESIO.\n\n[396:1b](ry344.htm#fr_801) Sinhika is the mother of Rahu the dragon\'s head or\nascending node, the chief agent in eclipses.\n\n[396:2b](ry344.htm#fr_802) Rahu is the demon who causes eclipses by attempting\nto swallow the sun and moon.\n\n[396:3b](ry344.htm#fr_803) According to De Gubernatis, the author of the very\nlearned, ingenious, and interesting though too fanciful _Zoological\nMythology._ Hanuman here represents the sun entering into and escaping from a\ncloud. The biblical Jonah, according to him, typifies the same phenomenon.\nSadi, p. 395 speaking of sunset, says _Y unas andar-i-dihan-i mahi shud_:\nJonas was within the fish\'s mouth.
