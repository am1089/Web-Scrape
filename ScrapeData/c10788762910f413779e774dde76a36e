We will separately explain the various penances for the several offences,\nboth heavier and lighter ones.\n\n2\\. Let him prescribe whatever may be befitting for each (case),--heavier\npenances for great (crimes), and lighter ones for trivial (faults).\n\n3\\. Let him perform the penances according to the rule given in the Institutes\nof the Sacred Law.\n\n4\\. He who is about to accept gifts, or he who has accepted gifts, must\nrepeatedly recite the four _Ri_ k-verses (called) Taratsamandis. 4\n\n5\\. But in case one has eaten any kind of forbidden food; or that given by a\nperson whose food must not be eaten, the means of removing the guilt is to\nsprinkle water (over one\'s head) while one recites the Taratsamandi _Ri_ _k_\nas. 5\n\n6\\. But we will, hereafter, declare another rule for (the expiation of) the\nmurder of a learned Brahma _n_ a, whereby (men) are freed also from mortal\nsins of all (kinds).\n\n7\\. Let him (perform), during twelve nights, suppressions\n\np. 318\n\nof the breath (and) mutter purificatory texts, the Vyah _ri_ tis, the syllable\nOm, (and) the Aghamarsha _n_ a hymn, (living) on milk;\n\n8\\. Or (he becomes) pure if he bathes, and during three (days and) nights\nsubsists on air and (remains dressed) in wet clothes.\n\n9\\. But if he has repeatedly committed forbidden acts of all kinds, and has\n(afterwards) worshipped reciting the Varu _n_ i (texts), he is freed from all\nsin. 9\n\n10\\. Now a student who has broken his vow (avakir _n_ in) shall heap fuel on\nthe fire on the night of the new moon, perform the preparatory ceremonies\nrequired for a Darvihoma, and offer two oblations of clarified butter\n(reciting the following texts): \'O Lust, I have broken my vow, my vow I have\nbroken, O Lust, to. Lust Svaha;\' \'O Lust, I have done evil, I have done evil,\nO Lust, to Lust Svaha.\' 10\n\n11\\. After he has made the offering, he shall address the fire, closely\njoining his hands and turning sideways, (with the following texts): \'May the\nMaruts grant me, may Indra, may B _ri_ haspati,, may this fire grant me long\nlife and strength, make me long-lived.\' The Maruts, forsooth, give back to him\nthe vital airs, Indra gives back to him strength, B _ri_ haspati the lustre of\nBrahman, Fire all the remainder. (Thus) his body is made whole, and he attains\nthe full length of life. Let him next address (the gods) with three\n(repetitions of the texts).\n\np. 319\n\n[paragraph continues] For the gods are trebly true. (All that) has been\ndeclared in the Veda.\n\n12\\. He who considers himself defiled by minor offences (upapataka), will be\nfreed from all guilt if he offers burnt oblations according to this same rule;\n12\n\n13\\. Or if he has partaken of food unfit to be eaten or to be drunk or of\nforbidden food, and if he has committed sinful acts or performed sinful rites\neither unintentionally or intentionally, and if he has had connexion with a\nfemale of the _S_ udra caste or committed an unnatural crime, he becomes pure\nby bathing (and reciting) the Abli\xe1\xb9\x85ga (verses) and (those called) Varu _n_ is.\n13\n\n14\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): If he has partaken of food\nunfit to be eaten or to be drunk, or of forbidden food, and if he has\ncommitted forbidden acts or performed forbidden rites, he will, nevertheless,\nbe freed from (crimes) committed intentionally which are similar to mortal\nsins, nay, even from mortal sins (pataka).\' 14\n\n15\\. Or let him fast during three (days and) nights, bathe thrice a day, and,\nsuppressing his breath, thrice recite the Aghamarsha _n_ a. Manu has declared\nthat that is equal (in efficacy) to the final bath at a horse-sacrifice. 15\n\np. 320\n\n16\\. And it is declared in the Veda, \'(That is) the ancient purificatory rite,\nwhich is widely known (in the Institutes of the Sacred Law); purified thereby\nman conquers sin. May we, sanctified by this holy means of purification,\nconquer our enemy, sin.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[317:4](sbe1484.htm#fr_1415) Gautama XXIV, 2.
