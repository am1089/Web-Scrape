But on account of twofold designation, (the relation of the highest Self\nto the individual soul has to be viewed) like that of the snake to its coils.\n\nIn order to justify his own view as to the relation of the conciliating\nindividual soul and the conciliated highest Self, the Sutrakara mentions a\ndifferent view of the same matter.--Some scriptural passages refer to the\nhighest Self and the individual soul as distinct entities, cp. e.g. Mu. Up.\nIII, 1, 8,' Then he sees him meditating on him as without parts,' where the\nhighest Self appears as the object of the soul's vision and meditation; Mu.\nUp. III, 2, 8, 'He goes to the divine Person who is greater than the great;'\nand 'B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 15, 'Who rules all beings within;' in which passages\nthe highest Self is represented as the object of approach and as the ruler of\nthe individual soul. In other places again the two are spoken of as non-\ndifferent, so e.g. _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 7, 'Thou art that;' B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10,\n'I am Brahman;' B _ri_. Up. III, 4, 1, 'This is thy Self who is within all;' B\n_ri_. Up. III, 7, 15, 'He is thy Self, the ruler within, the immortal.'--As\nthus difference and non-difference are equally vouched for by scripture, the\nacceptation of absolute non-difference would render futile all those\n\np. 174\n\ntexts which speak of difference. We therefore look on the relation of the\nhighest Self and the soul as analogous to that of the snake and its coils.\nViewed as a whole the snake is one, non-different, while an element of\ndifference appears if we view it with regard to its coils, hood, erect posture\nand so on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 28](sbe38131.htm)\n\n"
