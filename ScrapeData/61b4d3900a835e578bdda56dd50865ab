Prana, life or breath, personified as the supreme spirit.\n\n1\\. Reverence to Prana, to whom all this (universe) is subject, who has become\nthe lord of the all, on whom the all is supported!  \n2\\. Reverence, O Prana, to thy roaring (wind), reverence, O Prana, to thy\nthunder, reverence, O Prana, to thy lightning, reverence, O Prana, to thy\nrain!  \nWhen Prana calls aloud to the plants with his thunder, they are fecundated,\nthey conceive, and then are produced abundant (plants).  \n4\\. When the season has arrived, and Prana calls aloud to the plants, then\neverything rejoices, whatsoever is upon the earth.  \n5\\. When Prana has watered the great earth with rain, then the beasts rejoice;\n(they think): 'strength, forsooth, we shall now obtain.'  \n6\\. When they had been watered by Prana, the plants spake in concert: 'thou\nhast, forsooth, prolonged our life, thou hast made us all fragrant.'  \n7\\. Reverence be, O Prana, to thee coming, reverence to thee going; 'reverence\nto thee standing, and reverence, too, to thee sitting!  \n8\\. Reverence be to thee, O Prana, when thou breatbest in (primate), reverence\nwhen thou breathest out! Reverence be to thee when thou art turned away,\nreverence to thee when thou art turned hither: to thee, entire, reverence be\nhere!  \n9\\. Of thy dear form, O Prana, of thy very dear form, of the healing power\nthat is thine, give unto us, that we may live!  \n10\\. Prana clothes the creatures, as a father his dear son. Prana, truly, is\nthe lord of all, of all that breathes, and does not breathe.  \n11\\. Prana is death, Prana is fever. The gods worship Prana. Prana shall place\nthe truth-speaker in the highest world  \n12\\. Prana is Virag (power, lustre), Prana is Deshtri (the divinity that\nguides): all worship Prana. Prana verily is sun and moon. They call Prana\nPragapati.  \n13\\. Rice and barley are in-breathing and outbreathing. Prana is called a\nsteer. In-breathing forsooth, is founded upon barley; rice is called out-\nbreathing.  \n14\\. Man breathes out and breathes in when within the womb. When thou, O\nPrana, quickenest him, then is he born again.  \n15\\. They call Prana Matarisvan (the wind); Prana, forsooth, is called Vata\n(the wind). The past and the future, the all, verily is supported upon Prana.  \n16\\. The holy (atharvana) plants, the magic (angirasa) plants, the divine\nplants, and those produced by men, spring forth, when thou, O Prana,\nquickenest them.  \n17, When Prana has watered the great earth with rain, then the plants spring\nforth, and also every sort of herb.  \n18\\. Whoever, O Prana, knows this regarding thee, and (knows) on what thou art\nsupported, to him all shall offer tribute in yonder highest world.  \n19\\. As all these creatures, O Prana, offer thee tribute, so they shall offer\ntribute (in yonder world) to him who hears thee, O far-famed one!  \n20\\. He moves as an embryo within the gods; having arrived, and being in\nexistence, he is born again. Having arisen he enters with his mights the\npresent and the future, as a father (goes to) his son.  \n21\\. When as a swan he rises from the water he does not withdraw his one foot.\nIf in truth he were to withdraw it, there would be neither to-day, nor to-\nmorrow, no night and no day, never would the dawn appear.  \n22\\. With eight wheels, and one felloe he moves, containing a thousand sounds\n(elements), upward in the east, downward in the west. With (his) half he\nproduced the whole world: what is the visible sign of his (other) half?  \n23\\. He who rules over this (all) derived from every source, and over\neverything that movesreverence be to thee, O Prana, that wieldest a swift bow\nagainst others (the enemies)!  \n24\\. May Prana, who rules over this (all) derived from every source, and over\neverything that moves, (may he) unwearied, strong through the brahma, adhere\nto me!  \n25\\. Erect he watches in those that sleep, nor does lie lie down across. No\none has heard of his sleeping in those that sleep.  \n26\\. O Prana, be not turned away from me, thou shalt not be other than myself!\nAs the embryo of the waters (fire), thee, O Prana, do bind to me, that I may\nlive.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 2.
