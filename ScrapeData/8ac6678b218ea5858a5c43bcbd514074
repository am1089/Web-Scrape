Charm against kshetriya, hereditary disease.\n\n1\\. Upon the head of the nimble antelope a remedy grows! He has driven the\nkshetriya (inherited disease) in all directions by means of the horn.  \n2\\. The antelope has gone after thee with his four feet. O horn, loosen the\nkshetriya that is knitted into his heart!  \n3\\. (The horn) that glistens yonder like a roof with four wings (sides), with\nthat do we drive out every kshetriya from thy limbs.  \n4\\. The lovely twin stars, the vikritau ('the two looseners') that are yonder\nupon the sky, shall loosen the nethermost and the uppermost fetter of the\nkshetriya!  \n5\\. The waters, verily, are healers, the waters are scatterers of disease, the\nwaters cure all disease: may they. relieve thee from the kshetriya!  \n6\\. The kshetriya that has entered into thee from the prepared (magic)\nconcoction, for that I know the remedy; I drive the kshetriya out of thee.  \n7\\. When the constellations fade away, and when the dawn does fade away,\n(then) shall he shine away from us every evil and the kshetriya!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 23.
