And on account of the supporting also (attributed to it), (the small\nether must be the Lord) because that greatness is observed in him (according\nto other scriptural passages).\n\nAnd also on account of the \'supporting\' the small ether can be the highest\nLord only.--How?--The text at first introduces the general subject of\ndiscussion in the passage, \'In it is that small ether;\' declares thereupon\nthat the small one is to be compared with the universal ether, and that\neverything is contained in it; subsequently applies to it the term \'Self,\' and\nstates it to possess the qualities of being free from sin, &c.; and, finally,\ndeclares with reference to the same general subject of discussion, \'That Self\nis a bank, a limitary support (vidh _ri_ ti), that these worlds may not be\nconfounded.\' As \'support\' is here predicated of the Self, we have to\nunderstand by it a supporting agent. Just as a dam stems the spreading water\nso that the boundaries of the fields are not confounded, so that Self acts\nlike a limitary dam in order that these outer and inner worlds, and all the\ndifferent castes and a _s_ ramas may not be confounded. In accordance with\nthis our text declares that greatness, which is shown in the act of holding\nasunder, to belong to the small (ether) which forms the subject of discussion;\nand that such greatness is found in the highest Lord only, is seen from other\nscriptural passages, such as \'By the command of that Imperishable, O Gargi,\nsun and moon; are held apart"(B _ri_. Up. III, 8, 9). Similarly, we read in\nanother passage also, about whose referring to the highest\n\np. 182\n\nLord there is no doubt, \'He is the Lord of all, the king of all things, the\nprotector of all things. He is a bank and a limitary support, so that these\nworlds may not be confounded\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 12)--Hence, on account of\nthe \'supporting,\' also the small (ether) is nothing else but the highest Lord.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 17](sbe34086.htm)\n\n'
