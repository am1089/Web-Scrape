But of him who has become that there is no becoming not that, according\nto _G_ aimini also, on account of (Scripture) restraining from the absence of\nthe forms of that.\n\nThe doubt here arises whether those also who have fallen from the state of\nlife of a Naish _th_ ika, Vaikhanasa or Parivra _g_ aka are qualified for the\nknowledge of Brahman or not.--They are so, since in their case, no less than\nin that of widowers and the like, the growth of knowledge may be assisted by\ncharity and other practices not confined to a _s_ ramas.--This prima facie\nview the Sutra sets aside. 'He who has become that,' i.e. he who has entered\non the condition of a Naish _th_ ika or the like 'cannot become not that,'\ni.e. may not live in a non-a _s_ rama condition; since scriptural texts\nrestrain men who once have entered the Naish _th_ ika, &c., state 'from the\nabsence of the forms of that,' i.e. from the discontinuance of the special\nduties of their a _s_ rama. Compare texts such as 'He is to go into\n\np. 706\n\nthe forest, and is not to return from thence'; 'Having renounced the world he\nis not to return.' And hence persons who have lapsed from their a _s_ rama are\nnot qualified for meditation on Brahman. This view of his the Sutrakara\nstrengthens by a reference to the opinion of _G_ aimini.--But cannot a Naish\n_th_ ika who, through some sin, has lapsed from his duties and position, make\nup for his transgression by some expiatory act and thus again become fit for\nmeditation on Brahman?--To this point the next Sutra refers.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 41.
