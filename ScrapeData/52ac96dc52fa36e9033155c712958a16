But the making of names and forms (belongs) to him who renders\ntripartite, on account of scriptural teaching.\n\nThe Sutras have shown that the creation of the elements and organs in their\ncollective aspect (samash _t_ i) and the activity of the individual souls\nproceed from the highest Self; and they have also further confirmed the view\nthat the rule which the souls exercise over their organs depends on the\nhighest Self. A question now arises with regard to the creation of the world\nin its discrete aspect (vyash _t_ i), which consists in the differentiation of\nnames and forms (i.e. of individual beings). Is this latter creation the work\nof Hira _n_ yagarbha only, who represents the collective aggregate of all\nindividual souls; or, fundamentally, the work of the highest Brahman having\nHira _n_ yagarbha for its body--just as the creation of water e.g. is the work\nof the highest Brahman having sire for its body?--The Purvapakshin maintains\nthe former alternative. For, he says, the text 'Having entered with this\nliving-soul-self (anena _g_ ivenat-mana), let me differentiate names and\nforms' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 3, 2), declares the _g_ iva-soul to be the agent in\ndifferentiation. For the resolve of the highest deity is expressed, not in the\nform 'let me differentiate names and forms by myself (svena rupe _n_ a), but\n'by this soul-self,' i.e. by a part of the highest Self, in the form of the\nindividual soul.--But on this interpretation the first person in 'vyakarava\n_n_ i' (let me enter), and the grammatical form of 'having entered,' which\nindicates the agent, could not be taken in their literal, but only in an\nimplied, sense--as is the case in a sentence such as 'Having entered the\nhostile army by means of a spy, I will estimate its strength' (where the real\nagent is not the king, who is the speaker, but the spy).--The cases are not\nanalogous, the Purvapakshin replies. For the king and the spy are\nfundamentally separate, and hence the king is agent by implication only. But\nin the\n\np. 579\n\ncase under discussion the soul is a part, and hence contributes to constitute\nthe essential nature of, the highest Self; hence that highest Self itself\nenters and differentiates in the form of the soul. Nor can it be said that the\ninstrumental case ('with this soul-self') has the implied meaning of\nassociation ('together with this soul-self'); for if a case can be taken in\nits primary sense, it is not proper to understand it in a sense which has to\nbe expressed by means of a preposition. But the third case, _g_ ivena, cannot\nhere be understood even in its primary sense, i.e. that of the instrument of\nthe action; for if Brahman is the agent in the acts of entering and\ndifferentiating, the soul is not that which is most suitable to accomplish the\nend of action (while yet grammar defines the _instrumental_ case--kara _n_ a--\non this basis). Nor can it be said that the activity of the soul comes to an\nend with the entering, while the differentiation of names and forms is\nBrahman's work, for the past participle (pravi _s_ ya) indicates (according to\nthe rules of grammar) that the two actions--of entering and differentiating--\nbelong to the same agent. And although the soul as being a part of the highest\nSelf shares in its nature, yet in order to distinguish it from the highest\nSelf, the text by means of the clause 'with _that_ living Self refers to it as\nsomething outward (not of the nature of the Self). The agent in the action of\ndifferentiation of names and forms therefore is Hira _n_ yagarbha. Sm _ri_ ti\ntexts also ascribe to him this activity; cp.'he in the beginning made, from\nthe words of the Veda, the names and forms of beings, of the gods and the\nrest, and of actions.'\n\nAgainst this view the Sutra declares itself. The differentiation of names and\nforms belongs to him who renders tripartite, i.e. the highest Brahman; since\nit is assigned by Scripture to the latter only. For the text 'That divinity\nthought, let me, having entered these three beings with this living-soul-self,\ndifferentiate names and forms--let me make each of these three tripartite,'\nshows that all the activities mentioned have one and the same agent. But the\nrendering tripartite cannot belong to Brahma (Hira _n_ yagarbha), who abides\nwithin the Brahma-egg, for that egg\n\np. 580\n\nitself is produced from fire, water, and earth, only after these elements have\nbeen rendered tripartite; and Sm _ri_ ti says that Brahma himself originated\nin that egg, 'in that egg there originated Brahma, the grandfather of all the\nworlds.' As thus the action of rendering tripartite can belong to the highest\nBrahman only, the differentiation of names and forms, which belongs to the\nsame agent, also is Brahman's only.--But how then does the clause 'with that\nliving-soul-self' fit in?--The co-ordination 'with that soul, with the Self,'\nshows that the term 'soul' here denotes the highest Brahman as having the soul\nfor its body; just as in the clauses 'that fire thought'; 'it sent forth\nwater'; 'water thought,' and so on, what is meant each time is Brahman having\nfire, water, and so on, for its body. The work of differentiating names and\nforms thus belongs to the highest Brahman which has for its body Hira _n_\nyagarbha, who represents the soul in its aggregate form. On this view the\nfirst person (in 'let me differentiate') and the agency (conveyed by the form\nof 'pravi _s_ ya') may, without any difficulty, be taken in their primary\nliteral senses; and the common agency, implied in the connexion of pravi _s_\nya and vyakarava _n_ i, is accounted for. The view here set forth as to the\nrelation of Brahman and Hira _n_ yagarbha also explains how the accounts of\nHira _n_ yagarbha's (Brahma's) creative activity can say that he\ndifferentiated names and forms.\n\nThe whole passus beginning 'that divinity thought,' therefore has the\nfollowing meaning--'Having entered into those three beings, viz. Fire, Water,\nand Earth, with my Self which is qualified by the collective soul (as\nconstituting its body), let me differentiate names and forms, i.e. let me\nproduce gods and all the other kinds of individual beings, and give them\nnames; and to that end, since fire, water, and earth have not yet mutually\ncombined, and hence are incapable of giving rise to particular things, let me\nmake each of them tripartite, and thus fit them for creation.'--The settled\nconclusion then is, that the differentiation of names and forms is the work of\nthe highest Brahman only.\n\nBut, an objection is raised, the fact that the differentiation\n\np. 581\n\nof names and forms must be due to the same agent as the rendering tripartite,\ndoes not after all prove that the former is due to the highest Self. For the\nrendering tripartite may itself belong to the individual soul. For the text\nrelates how, after the creation of the cosmic egg, a process of tripartition\nwas going on among the individual living beings created by Brahma. 'Learn from\nme, my friend, how those three beings having reached man become tripartite,\neach of them. The earth when eaten is disposed of in three ways; its grossest\nportion becomes feces, its middle portion flesh, its subtlest portion mind,'\nand so on. Similarly, in the preceding section, it is described how the\nprocess of tripartition goes on in the case of fire, sun, moon, and lightning,\nwhich all belong to the world created by Brahma, 'the red colour of burning\nfire is the colour of fire,' &c. And the text moreover states the original\ntripartition to have taken place after the differentiation of names and forms:\n'That divinity having entered into these three beings differentiated names and\nforms. Each of these (beings) it rendered tripartite.'--To this objection the\nnext Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 18. Flesh is of earthy nature...](sbe48316.htm)\n\n"
