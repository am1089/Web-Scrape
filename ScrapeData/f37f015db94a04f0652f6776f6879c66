But on account of (water) consisting of three (elements) (the soul is\nenveloped not by water merely; the latter alone is, however, mentioned) on\naccount of preponderance.\n\nThe word 'but' disposes of the objection raised.--Water consists of three\nelements, as we know from the scriptural statement regarding tripartition. If,\ntherefore, water is admitted to originate (the new body) the other two\nelements also have necessarily to be admitted (as taking part in the\norigination). The body moreover consists of three elements, as the effects of\nthe three, i.e. fire, water, and earth, are observed in it, and further as it\ncontains three materials, viz. wind, bile, and phlegm 3. Being such it cannot\noriginate from mere water, the other elements being left aside. Hence the term\nwater made use of in the scriptural question and answer refers to the fact of\nwater preponderating,\n\np. 105\n\nnot to its being the only element. As a matter of fact we see that in all\nanimated bodies liquid substances such as juices, blood, and the like\npreponderate.--But we likewise observe in bodies a large amount of earthy\nmatter!--True, but the amount of water is larger than that of any other\nmatter. Moreover, liquid matter prevails in that which is the seed of the\nbody. Further, we know that works (karman) constitute the efficient cause for\nthe origination of a new body, and (sacrificial) works such as the agnihotra,\n&c., consist in the offering of liquid substances such as Soma, butter, milk\nand the like. Thereby also the preponderance of water is established. And on\naccount of that preponderance the word 'water' implies the subtle parts of all\nthe elements which constitute the seed of the body.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[104:3](sbe38078.htm#fr_71) The last of which only is of prevailingly watery\ncharacter.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 3](sbe38079.htm)\n\n"
