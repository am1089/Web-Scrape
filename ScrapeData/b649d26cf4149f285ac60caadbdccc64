VI.\n\nOrigin of the four castes: their primitive state. Progress of society.\nDifferent kinds of grain. Efficacy of sacrifice. Duties of men: regions\nassigned them after death.\n\nMAITREYA.--Thou hast briefly noticed, illustrious sage, the creation termed\nArvaksrotas, or that of mankind: now explain to me more fully how Brahma\naccomplished it; how he created the four different castes; what duties he\nassigned to the Brahmans and the rest 1.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Formerly, oh best of Brahmans, when the truth-meditating Brahma was\ndesirous of creating the world, there sprang from his mouth beings especially\nendowed with the quality of goodness; others from his breast, pervaded by the\nquality of foulness; others from his thighs, in whom foulness and darkness\nprevailed; and others from his feet, in whom the quality of darkness\npredominated. These were, in succession, beings of the several castes,\nBrahmans, Kshetriyas, Vaisyas, and \xc5\x9audras, produced from the mouth, the\nbreast, the thighs, and the feet of Brahma 2. These he created for the\nperformance of sacrifices, the four castes being the fit instruments of their\ncelebration. By sacrifices, oh thou who knowest the truth, the gods are\nnourished; and by the rain which they bestow, mankind are supported 3: and\nthus sacrifices, the source of happiness, are performed by pious men, attached\nto their duties, attentive to prescribed obligations, and walking in the paths\nof virtue. Men acquire (by them) heavenly fruition, or final felicity: they\ngo, after death, to whatever sphere they aspire to, as the consequence of\ntheir human\n\np. 45\n\nnature. The beings who were created by Brahma, of these four castes, were at\nfirst endowed with righteousness and perfect faith; they abode wherever they\npleased, unchecked by any impediment; their hearts were free from guile; they\nwere pure, made free from soil, by observance of sacred institutes. In their\nsanctified minds Hari dwelt; and they were filled with perfect wisdom, by\nwhich they contemplated the glory of Vishn\xcc\x81u 4. After a while (after the Treta\nage had continued for some period), that portion of Hari which has been\ndescribed as one with Kala (time) infused into created beings sin, as yet\nfeeble though formidable, or passion and the like: the impediment of soul's\nliberation, the seed of iniquity, sprung from darkness and desire. The innate\nperfectness of human nature was then no more evolved: the eight kinds of\nperfection, Rasollasa and the rest, were impaired 5; and these being\nenfeebled, and sin gaining strength, mortals were afflicted with pain, arising\nfrom susceptibility to contrasts, as heat and cold, and the like. They\ntherefore constructed places of refuge, protected by trees, by mountains, or\nby water; surrounded them by a ditch or a wall, and formed villages and\ncities; and in them erected appropriate dwellings, as defences against the sun\nand the cold 6. Having thus provided security against\n\np. 46\n\nthe weather, men next began to employ themselves in manual labour, as a means\nof livelihood, (and cultivated) the seventeen kinds of useful grain--rice,\nbarley, wheat, millet, sesamum, panic, and various sorts of lentils, beans,\nand pease 7. These are the kinds cultivated for domestic\n\np. 47\n\nuse: but there are fourteen kinds which may be offered in sacrifice; they are,\nrice, barley, Masha, wheat, millet, and sesamum; Priyangu is the seventh, and\nkulattha, pulse, the eighth: the others are, Syamaka, a sort of panic; Nivara,\nuncultivated rice; Jarttila, wild sesamum; Gaveduka (coix); Markata, wild\npanic; and (a plant called) the seed or barley of the Bambu (Venu-yava).\nThese, cultivated or wild, are the fourteen grains that were produced for\npurposes of offering in sacrifice; and sacrifice (the cause of rain) is their\norigin also: they again, with sacrifice, are the great cause of the\nperpetuation of the human race, as those understand who can discriminate cause\nand effect. Thence sacrifices were offered daily; the performance of which, oh\nbest of Munis, is of essential service to mankind, and expiates the offences\nof those by whom they are observed. Those, however, in whose hearts the dross\nof sin derived from Time (Kala) was still more developed, assented not to\nsacrifices, but reviled both them and all that resulted from them, the gods,\nand the followers of the Vedas. Those abusers of the Vedas, of evil\ndisposition and conduct, and seceders from the path of enjoined duties, were\nplunged in wickedness 8.\n\nThe means of subsistence having been provided for the beings he had created,\nBrahma prescribed laws suited to their station and faculties, the duties of\nthe several castes and orders 9, and the regions of those of the different\ncastes who were observant of their duties. The heaven of the Pitris is the\nregion of devout Brahmans. The sphere of Indra, of\n\np. 48\n\n[paragraph continues] Kshetriyas who fly not from the field. The region of the\nwinds is assigned to the Vaisyas who are diligent in their occupations and\nsubmissive. \xc5\x9audras are elevated to the sphere of the Gandharbas. Those\nBrahmans who lead religious lives go to the world of the eighty-eight thousand\nsaints: and that of the seven Rishis is the seat of pious anchorets and\nhermits. The world of ancestors is that of respectable householders: and the\nregion of Brahma is the asylum of religious mendicants 10. The imperishable\nregion of the Yogis is the highest seat of Vishn\xcc\x81u, where they perpetually\nmeditate upon the supreme being, with minds intent on him alone: the sphere\nwhere they reside, the gods themselves cannot behold. The sun, the moon, the\nplanets, shall repeatedly be, and cease to be; but those who internally repeat\nthe mystic adoration of the divinity, shall never know decay. For those who\nneglect their duties, who revile the Vedas, and obstruct religious rites, the\nplaces assigned after death are the terrific regions of darkness, of deep\ngloom, of fear, and of great terror; the fearful hell of sharp swords, the\nhell of scourges and of a waveless sea 11.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[44:1](vp040.htm#fr_188) The creation of mankind here described is rather out\nof its place, as it precedes the birth of the Prajapatis, or their\nprogenitors: but this want of method is common to the Puran\xcc\x81as, and is\nevidence of their being compilations from various sources.\n\n[44:2](vp040.htm#fr_189) This original of the four castes is given in Manu,\nand in most of the Puran\xcc\x81as. We shall see, however, that the distinctions are\nsubsequently ascribed to voluntary election, to accident, or to positive\ninstitutions.\n\n[44:3](vp040.htm#fr_190) According to Manu, oblations ascend to and nourish\nthe sun; whence the rain falls upon earth, and causes the growth of corn:\nburnt-offerings are therefore the final causes of the support of mankind.\n\n[45:4](vp040.htm#fr_191) This description of a pure race of beings is not of\ngeneral occurrence in the Puran\xcc\x81as. It seems here to be abridged from a much\nmore detailed account in the Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, Vayu, and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya Puran\xcc\x81as. In\nthose works Brahma is said to create, in the beginning of the Kalpa, a\nthousand pairs of each of the four classes of mankind, who enjoy perfect\nhappiness during the Krita age, and only gradually become subject to\ninfirmities as the Treta or second age advances.\n\n[45:5](vp040.htm#fr_192) These eight perfections, or Siddhis, are not the\nsupernatural faculties obtained by the performance of the Yoga. They are\ndescribed, the commentator says, in the Skanda and other works; and from them\nhe extracts their description: 1. Rasollasa, the spontaneous or prompt\nevolution of the juices of the body, independently of nutriment from without:\n2. Tripti, mental satisfaction, or freedom from sensual desire: 3. Samya,\nsameness of degree: 4. Tulyata, similarity of life, form, and feature: 5.\nVisoka, exemption alike from infirmity or grief: 6. Consummation of penance\nand meditation, by attainment of true knowledge: 7. The power of going every\nwhere at will: 8. The faculty of reposing at any time or in any place. These\nattributes are alluded to, though obscurely, in the Vayu, and are partly\nspecified in the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\n[45:6](vp040.htm#fr_193) In the other three Puran\xcc\x81as, in which this legend has\nbeen found, the different kinds of inhabited places are specified and p. 46\nintroduced by a series of land measures. Thus the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya states, that 10\nParaman\xcc\x81us = 1 Parasukshma; 10 Parasukshmas = 1 Trasaren\xcc\x81u; 10 Trasaren\xcc\x81us = 1\nparticle of dust, or Mahirajas; 10 Mahirajasas = 1 Balagra, 'hair's point;' 10\nBalagras = 1 Likhya; 10 Likhyas= 1 Yuka; to Yukas = 1 heart of barley\n(Yavodara); 10 Yavodaras = 1 grain of barley of middle size; 10 barley grains\n= 1 finger, or inch; 6 fingers = a Pada, or foot (the breadth of it); 2 Padas\n= 1 Vitasti, or span; 2 spans = 1 Hasta, or cubit; 4 Hastas = a Dhanu, a\nDanda, or staff, or 2 Narikas; 2000 Dhanus = a Gavyuti; 4 Gavyutis = a Yojana.\nThe measurement of the Brahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a is less detailed. A span from the thumb to\nthe first finger is a Prade\xc5\x9ba; to the middle finger, a Nala; to the third\nfinger, a Gokerna; and to the little finger, a Vitasti, which is equal to\ntwelve Angulas, or fingers; understanding thereby, according to the Vayu, a\njoint of the finger; according to other authorities, it is the breadth of the\nthumb at the tip. (A. R. 5. 104.) The Vayu, giving similar measurements upon\nthe authority of Manu, although such a statement does not occur in the Manu\nSanhita, adds, that 21 fingers= 1 Ratni; 24 fingers = 1 Hasta, or cubit; 2\nRatnis = 1 Kishku; 4 Hastas = 1 Dhanu; 2000 Dhanus = l Gavyuti; and 8000\nDhanus = 1 Yojana. Durgas, or strong holds, are of four kinds; three of which\nare natural, from, their situation in mountains, amidst water, or in other\ninaccessible spots; the fourth is the artificial defences of a village\n(Grama), a hamlet (Khet\xcc\x81aka), or a city (Pura or Nagara), which are severally\nhalf the size of the next in the series. The best kind of city is one which is\nabout a mile long by half a mile broad, built in the form of a parallelogram,\nfacing the northeast, and surrounded by a high wall and ditch. A hamlet should\nbe a Yojana distant from a city: a village half a Yojana from a hamlet. The\nroads leading to the cardinal points from a city should be twenty Dhanus\n(above too feet) broad: a village road should be the same: a boundary road ten\nDhanus: a royal or principal road or street should be ten Dhanus (above fifty\nfeet) broad: a cross or branch road should be four Dhanus. Lanes and paths\namongst the houses are two Dhanus in breadth: footpaths four cubits: the\nentrance of a house three cubits: the private entrances and paths about the\nmansion of still narrower dimensions. Such were the measurements adopted by\nthe first builders of cities, according to the Puran\xcc\x81as specified.\n\n[46:7](vp040.htm#fr_194) These are enumerated in the text, as well as in the\nVayu and Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya P., and are, Udara, a sort of grain with long stalks\n(perhaps a holcus); Kodrava (Paspalum kora); Chinaka, a sort of panic (P.\nmiliaceum); Masha, kidney bean (Phaseolus radiatus); Mudga (Phaseolus mungo);\nMasura, lentil (Ervum hirsutum); Nishpava, a sort of pulse; Kulattha (Dolithos\np. 47 biflorus); Arhaki (Cytisus Cajan); Chanaka, chick pea (Cicer arietinum);\nand Sana (Crotolaria).\n\n[47:8](vp040.htm#fr_195) This allusion to the sects hostile to the Vedas,\nBuddhists or Jains, does not occur in the parallel passages of the Vayu and\nMarkan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya Puran\xcc\x81as.\n\n[47:9](vp040.htm#fr_196) The Vayu goes farther than this, and states that the\ncastes were now first divided according to their occupations; having, indeed,\npreviously stated that there was no such distinction in the Krita age: 'Brahma\nnow appointed those who were robust and violent to be Kshetriyas, to protect\nthe rest; those who were pure and pious he made Brahmans; those who were of\nless power, but industrious, and addicted to cultivate the ground, he made\nVaisyas; whilst the feeble and poor of spirit were constituted \xc5\x9audras: and he\nassigned them their several occupations, to prevent that interference with one\nanother which had occurred as long as they recognised no duties peculiar to\ncastes.\n\n[48:10](vp040.htm#fr_197) These worlds, some of which will be more\nparticularly described in a different section, are the seven Lokas or spheres\nabove the earth: 1. Prajapatya or Pitri loka: 2. Indra loka or Swerga: 3.\nMarut loka or Diva loka, heaven: 4. Gandharba loka, the region of celestial\nspirits; also called Maharloka: 5. Janaloka, or the sphere of saints; some\ncopies read eighteen thousand; others, as in the text, which is also the\nreading of the Padma Puran\xcc\x81a: 6. Tapaloka, the world of the seven sages: and\n7. Brahma loka or Satya loka, the world of infinite wisdom and truth. The\neighth, or high world of Vishn\xcc\x81u, is a sectarial addition, which in the\nBhagavata is called Vaikuntha, and in the Brahma Vaivartta, Goloka; both\napparently, and most certainly the last, modern inventions.\n\n[48:11](vp040.htm#fr_198) The divisions of Naraka, or hell, here named, are\nagain more particularly enumerated, b.
