This is called Omk\xc4\x81ra.\nKnow it by means of the \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81s, _viz_., concentration on each of the twelve\nkal\xc4\x81s, or the variations of the m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s produced by the difference of svaras or\nintonation). The first m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81 is called ghoshi\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab; the second, vi\xe1\xb8\x8dyunm\xc4\x81li (or\nvi\xe1\xb8\x8dyunm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81); the third, pa\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\x85gin\xc4\xab; the fourth, v\xc4\x81yuvegin\xc4\xab; the fifth,\nn\xc4\x81ma\xe1\xb8\x8dheya; the sixth, ain\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\xab; the seventh, vaish\xe1\xb9\x87av\xc4\xab; the eighth, \xc5\x9b\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x85kar\xc4\xab; the\nninth, maha\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\xab; the tenth, \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi (\xe1\xb8\x8dhruva, Calcutta ed.); the eleventh, n\xc4\x81r\xc4\xab\n(mauni, Calcutta ed.); and the twelfth, br\xc4\x81hm\xc4\xab. 1\n\nIf a person happens to die in the first m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81 (while contemplating on it), he\nis born again as. a great emperor in Bh\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\xadavarsha.\n\nIf in the second m\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81, he becomes an illustrious yaksha; if in the third\nm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81, a vi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhara; if in the fourth, a gan\xe1\xb8\x8dharva (these three being the\ncelestial hosts).\n\nIf he happens to die in the fifth, _viz_., ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81, he lives in the world\nof the moon, with the rank of a \xe1\xb8\x8deva greatly glorified there.\n\nIf in the sixth, he merges into In\xe1\xb8\x8dra; if in the seventh, he reaches the seat\nof Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u; if in the eighth, Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra, the Lord of all creatures.\n\nIf in the ninth, in Maharloka; if in the tenth, in Janoloka (\xe1\xb8\x8chruvaloka,\nCalcutta ed.); if in the eleventh, \xe1\xb9\xacapoloka, and if in the twelfth, he attains\nthe eternal 2 state of Brahma.\n\np. 256\n\nThat which is beyond these, ( _viz_.,) Parabrahman which is beyond (the above\nm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81s), the pure, the all-pervading, beyond kal\xc4\x81s, the ever resplendent and\nthe source of all jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis (light) should be known.\n\n 1 When the mind goes beyond the organs and the gu\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81s and is absorbed, having\nno separate existence and no mental action, then (the guru) should instruct\nhim (as to his further course of development).\n\nThat person always engaged in its contemplation and always absorbed in it\nshould gradually leave off his body (or family) following the course of yoga\nand avoiding all intercourse with society.\n\nThen he, being freed from the bonds of karma and the existence as a j\xc4\xabva and\nbeing pure, enjoys the supreme bliss by his attaining of the state of Brahm\xc4\x81.\n2\n\nO intelligent man, spend your life always in the knowing of the supreme bliss,\nenjoying the whole of your pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha (that portion of past karma now being\nenjoyed) without making ally complaint (of it).\n\nEven after \xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadmaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na (knowledge of Mind or Self) has awakened (in one),\npr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha does not leave (him); but he does not feel pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha after the\ndawning of \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na 3 (knowledge of \xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva or truth) because the body and\nother things are asa\xe1\xb9\xad (unreal), like the things seen in a dream to one on\nawaking from it.\n\nThat (portion of the) karma which is done in former births, and called\npr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha does not at all affect the person (\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvaj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab), as there is no\nrebirth 'to him.\n\nAs the body that exists in the dreaming state is untrue, so is this body.\nWhere then is rebirth to a thing that is illusory? How can a thing have any\nexistence, when there is no birth (to it)?\n\nAs the clay is the material cause of the pot, so one learns from Ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada that\naj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is the material cause of the\n\np. 257\n\nuniverse: and when aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na ceases to exist, where then is the cosmos?\n\nAs a person through illusion mistakes a rope for a serpent, so the fool not\nknowing Sa\xe1\xb9\xadya (the eternal truth) sees the world (to be true.)\n\nWhen he knows it to be a piece of rope, the illusory idea of a serpent\nvanishes.\n\nSo when he knows the eternal substratum of everything and all the universe\nbecomes (therefore) void (to him), where then is pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha to him, the body\nbeing a part of the world? Therefore the word pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha is accepted to\nenlighten the ignorant (only).\n\nThen as pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha has, in course of time, worn out, he who is the sound\nresulting from the union of Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava with Brahman who is the absolute\neffulgence itself, and who is the bestower of all good, shines himself like\nthe sun at the dispersion of the clouds.\n\nThe yogin being in the si\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81sana (posture) and practising the vaish\xe1\xb9\x87av\xc4\xabmu\xe1\xb8\x8dr\xc4\x81,\nshould always hear the internal sound through the right ear.\n\nThe sound which he thus practises makes him deaf to all external sounds.\nHaving overcome all obstacles, he enters the \xe1\xb9\xadurya state within fifteen days.\n\nIn the beginning of his practice, he hears many loud sounds. They gradually\nincrease in pitch and are heard more and more subtly.\n\nAt first, the sounds are like those proceeding from- the ocean, clouds,\nkettle-drum, and cataracts: in the middle (stage) those proceeding from\nmar\xe1\xb8\x8dala (a musical instrument), bell, and horn.\n\nAt the last stage, those proceeding from tinkling bells, flute, v\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81 (a\nmusical instrument), and bees. Thus he hears many such sounds more and more\nsubtle.\n\nWhen he comes to that stage when the sound of the great kettle-drum is being\nheard, he should try to distinguish only sounds more and more subtle.\n\nHe may change his concentration from the gross sound to the subtle, or from\nthe subtle to the gross, but he should not allow his mind to be diverted from\nthem towards others.\n\np. 258\n\nThe mind having at first concentrated itself on any one sound fixes firmly to\nthat and is absorbed in it.\n\nIt (the mind) becoming insensible to the external impressions, i becomes one\nwith the sound as milk with water, and then becomes rapidly absorbed in\nchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b (the ak\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b where Chi\xe1\xb9\xad prevails).\n\nBeing indifferent towards all objects, the yogin having controlled his\npassions, should by continual practice concentrate his attention upon the\nsound which destroys the mind.\n\nHaving abandoned all thoughts and being freed from all actions, he should\nalways concentrate his attention on the sound, and (then) his chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada becomes\nabsorbed in it.\n\nJust as the bee drinking the honey (alone) does not care for the odour, so the\nchi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada which is always absorbed in sound, does not long for sensual objects,\nas it is bound by the sweet smell of n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da and has abandoned its flitting\nnature.\n\nThe serpent chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada through listening to the n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da is entirely absorbed in it,\nand becoming unconscious of everything concentrates itself on the sound.\n\nThe sound serves the purpose of a sharp goad to control the maddened elephant\n--chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada which roves in the pleasure-garden of the sensual objects.\n\nIt serves the purpose of a snare for binding the deer--chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada. It also serves\nthe purpose of a shore to the ocean waves of chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada.\n\nThe sound proceeding from Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava which is Brahman is of the nature of\neffulgence; the mind becomes absorbed in it; that is the supreme seat of\nVish\xe1\xb9\x87u.\n\nThe sound exists till there is the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9bic conception (\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9basa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa). Beyond\nthis, is the (a\xc5\x9bab\xe1\xb8\x8da) soundless Parabrahman which is Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81.\n\nThe mind exists so long as there is sound, but with its (sound's) cessation,\nthere is the state called unman\xc4\xab of manas ( _viz_., the state of being above\nthe mind).\n\nThis sound is absorbed in the Akshara (indestructible) and the soundless state\nis the supreme seat.\n\nThe mind which along with Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a (V\xc4\x81yu) has (its) karmic affinities destroyed\nby the constant concentration upon n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da is absorbed in the unstained One.\nThere is no doubt of it.\n\np. 259\n\nMany myriads of n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8das and many more of bin\xe1\xb8\x8dus--(all) become absorbed in the\nBrahma-Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava sound.\n\nBeing freed from all states and all thoughts whatever, the yogin remains like\none dead. He is a muk\xe1\xb9\xada. There is no doubt about this.\n\nAfter that, he does not at any time hear the sounds of conch or \xe1\xb8\x8dun\xe1\xb8\x8dubhi\n(large kettle-drum).\n\nThe body in the state of unman\xc4\xab is certainly like a log and does not feel heat\nor cold, joy or sorrow.\n\nThe yogin's chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada having given up fame or disgrace is in sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi above the\nthree states.\n\nBeing freed from the waking and the sleeping states, he attains to his true\nstate.\n\nWhen the (spiritual) sight becomes fixed without any object to be seen, when\nthe v\xc4\x81yu (pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a) becomes still without any effort, and when the chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada becomes\nfirm without any support, he becomes of the form of the internal sound of\nBrahma-Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava.\n\nSuch is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[254:1](tmu31.htm#fr_238) Lit., Sound-seed.\n\n[254:2](tmu31.htm#fr_239) The commentator says that M is the last letter and\nhence tail and ar\xe1\xb8\x8dham\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81 is the head, as it enables one to attain to higher\nworlds.\n\n[254:3](tmu31.htm#fr_240) Another reading is: The qualities are its feet,\netc., and \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva is its body.\n\n[254:4](tmu31.htm#fr_241) Comm.: Since this man\xe1\xb9\xadra has already occurred in the\npreceding kha\xe1\xb9\x87da of the same s\xc4\x81kh\xc4\x81, it is simply referred in the text.
