Brahman Svayambhu (the self-existent, n.) was performing\nausterities 3. He said this much,--\n\np. 418\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Verily, there is no perpetuity in austerities; well,\nthen, I will offer up mine own self in the creatures, and the creatures in\nmine own self.' And, accordingly, by offering up his own self in the\ncreatures, and the creatures in his own self, he compassed the supremacy, the\nsovereignty, and the lordship over all creatures; and in like manner does the\nSacrificer, by thus offering all sacrificial essences 1 in the Sarvamedha,\ncompass all beings, and supremacy, sovereignty, and lordship.\n\n13:7:1:22\\. Now this Sarvamedha is a ten-days' (Soma-) sacrifice, for the sake\nof his gaining and winning every kind of food, for the Vira _g_ consists of\nten syllables, and the Vira _g_ is all food. At this (sacrifice) he builds the\ngreatest possible fire-altar, for this--to wit, the Sarvamedha--is supreme\namongst all sacrificial performances: by means of the supreme (sacrifice) he\nthus causes him (the Sacrificer) to attain supremacy.\n\n13:7:1:33\\. The first day thereof is an Agnish _t_ ut Agnish _t_ oma 2, for\nthe sake of his gaining and winning all the gods, for the Agnish _t_ ut Agnish\n_t_ oma is Agni; and all the gods have Agni (the sacrificial fire) for their\nmouth, The cups of Soma thereat pertain to Agni, and so do the Puroru _k_  3\nformulas pertain to Agni, in order that everything should pertain to Agni.\n\np. 419\n\n13:7:1:44\\. The second day is an Indrastut Ukthya, for the sake of his gaining\nand winning all the gods, for Indra is all the gods. The cups of Soma thereat\npertain to Indra, and so do the Puroru _k_ formulas pertain to Indra, in order\nthat everything should pertain to Indra.\n\n13:7:1:55\\. The third day is a Suryastut, Ukthya, for the sake of his gaining\nand winning all the gods, for Surya is all the gods. The cups of Soma pertain\nto Surya, and so do the Puroru _k_ formulas pertain to Surya, in order that\neverything should pertain to Surya.\n\n13:7:1:66\\. The fourth day is a Vai _s_ vadeva, for the sake of his gaining\nand winning all the gods, for the All-gods (Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ ) are all the\ngods. The cups of Soma pertain to the All-gods, and so do the Puroru _k_\nformulas pertain to the All-gods, in order that everything should pertain to\nthe All-gods.\n\n13:7:1:77\\. The fifth day is a central \xc3\x82 _s_ vamedhika 1 one: at this\n(sacrifice) he seizes a horse meet for sacrifice, for the sake of his gaining\nthe sacrificial essence of the horse.\n\n13:7:1:88\\. The sixth day is a central Paurushamedhika 2 one: at this\n(sacrifice) he seizes men meet for sacrifice, for the sake of his gaining the\nsacrificial essence of man.\n\n13:7:1:99\\. The seventh day is an Aptoryama, for the sake of his gaining all\nkinds of Soma-sacrifices: at this (sacrifice) he seizes all kinds of (victims)\nmeet for sacrifice, both what is animate and what is\n\np. 420\n\ninanimate. Of those with omenta he offers the omenta, and of those without\nomenta they throw down pieces cut out of the skin 1, and of herbs and trees\nthey do so after cutting them up,--every kind of food of both the dry and the\nfresh he offers, in order to gain every kind of food. Everything he offers;\nand, to every one he offers in order to gain and to win everything. The omenta\nhaving been offered at the morning-service, and in the same way the oblations\nat the evening-service,--\n\n13:7:1:1010\\. The eighth day is a Tri _n_ ava one 2, for the Tri _n_ ava\n(stoma) is the thunderbolt, and by means of the thunderbolt, indeed, lordship\n(kshatra) is gained: by means of the thunderbolt he thus gains lordship.\n\n13:7:1:1111\\. The ninth day is a Trayastri _m_ _s_ a one 3, for the sake of\nhis gaining a foothold, for the Trayastri _m_ _s_ a (stoma) is a foothold.\n\n13:7:1:1212\\. The tenth day is a Vi _s_ va _g_ it Atiratra with all the P _ri_\nsh _th_ as 4, for the sake of his gaining and winning everything, for the Vi\n_s_ va _g_ it Atiratra with all the P _ri_ sh _th_ as is everything, and the\nSarvamedha is everything.\n\n13:7:1:1313\\. Now as to the sacrificial fees: whatever there is towards the\nmiddle of the kingdom other than the property of the Brahma _n_ a, but\nincluding land and\n\np. 421\n\nmen, of that the eastern quarter belongs to the Hot _ri_ , the southern to the\nBrahman, the western to the Adhvaryu, and the northern to the Udgat _ri_ ; and\nthe Hot _ri_ kas share this along with them.\n\n13:7:1:1414\\. Vi _s_ vakarman Bhauvana once performed this sacrifice, and\nhaving performed it he overpassed all beings, and became everything here; and\nverily he who, knowing this, performs the Sarvamedha, or who even knows this,\noverpasses all beings, and becomes everything here.\n\n13:7:1:1515\\. It was Ka _s_ yapa who officiated in his sacrifice, and it was\nconcerning this that the Earth 1 also sang the stanza;--'No mortal must give\nme away; thou wast foolish, Vi _s_ vakarman Bhauvana: she (the earth) will\nsink into the midst of the water; vain is this thy promise unto Ka _s_ yapa.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[417:3](sbe44112.htm#fr_1107) Cf.
