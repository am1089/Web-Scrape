Or (he shall do so) with the verse, 'Carry the omentum, _G_ atavedas, to\nthe Manes, where thou knowest them in the world of virtue. May streams of fat\nflow to them; may the wishes of the sacrificer be fulfilled. Svaha!'\n\n4\\.

On madhyavarsha, comp. Weber, loc. cit.,\npp. 331, 337. Naraya _n_ a understands not 'in the middle of the rainy\nseason,' but 'in the middle of the year' (see his note, p. 146 of the German\nedition). I cannot help thinking that the word madhyavarshe, given by the MSS.\nhere and in Paraskara III, 3, 13, and explained by Naraya _n_ a, is a corrupt\nreading which we should correct into maghyavarshe ('the festival celebrated\nduring the rainy season under the Nakshatra Maghas'), or something like that.\nThe MSS. of \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya II, 5, 9 have maghyavarsha _m_ ,\nmaghavarsha _m_ , madhyavarsha _m_. Vish _n_ u (LXXVI, 1, comp. LXXVIII, 52,\nand Professor Jolly's note, Sacred Books of the East, VII, p. 240) mentions\n'the three Ash _t_ akas, the three Anvash _t_ akas, a Magha day which falls on\nthe thirteenth of the dark half of the month Praush _th_ apada.' Comp. Manu\nIII, 273, varshasu _k_ a maghasu _k_ a; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 260.\n\n[104:5](sbe29061.htm#fr_227) Instead of 'N.N.' (the text has the feminine\namushyai) the sacrificer inserts the name of his mother. For masas, ardhamasas\nI propose to read, masais, ardhamasais.\n\n[104:7](sbe29061.htm#fr_228) On Anvash _t_ akya, comp.
