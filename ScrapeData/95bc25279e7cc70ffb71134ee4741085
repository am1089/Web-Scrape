The other Agnis (the other fires) are verily thy branches, O Agni. In thee\nall the immortals enjoy themselves [1](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:1:1). Vai _s_\nvanara! Thou art the centre [2](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:1:2) of human\nsettlements; like a supporting column thou holdest men\n[3](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:1:3).\n\n2\\. The head of heaven, the navel of the earth is Agni; he has become the\nsteward [1](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:2:1) of both worlds. Thee, a god, the gods\nhave engendered, O Vai _s_ vanara, to be a light for the \xc3\x82rya.\n\n3\\. As in the sun the rays are firmly fixed, thus in Agni Vai _s_ vanara all\ntreasures have been laid down [1](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:3:1). (The treasures)\nwhich dwell in the mountains, in the herbs, the waters, and among men--of all\nthat thou art the king.\n\n4\\. As the two great worlds to their son [1](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:4:1), like a\nHot _ri_ , like a skilful man, (we bring) praises--manifold (praises) to him\nwho is united with the sun, to the truly strong one, new (praises) to Vai _s_\nvanara, the manliest god.\n\n5\\. Thy greatness, O _G_ atavedas, Vai _s_ vanara, has exceeded even the great\nheaven. Thou art the king of the human tribes; thou hast by fighting gained\nwide space for the gods.\n\n6\\. Let me now proclaim the greatness of the bull whom the Purus worship as\nthe destroyer of enemies [1](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:6:1). Agni Vai _s_ vanara,\nhaving slain the Dasyu, shook the (aerial) arena and cut down _S_ ambara.\n\np. 50\n\n7\\. Agni Vai _s_ vanara, extending by his greatness over all dominions, who is\nto be worshipped, the bright one, rich in loveliness, is awake (or, is\npraised) among the Bharadva _g_ as, in the homestead of Puru _n_ itha _S_\natavaneya, with his hundredfold blessings.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi as in I, 58. Metre, Trish _t_ ubh. None of the verses of\nthis hymn occurs in the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Comp. VII, 11, 1. na _ri_ te tvat am _r i_ta _h_ madayante, 'the\nimmortals do not enjoy themselves without thee.'\n\nNote 2. Literally, 'the navel.' Comp. Muir, V, 214.\n\nNote 3. Comp. IV, 5, 1 (see below). upa stabhayat upamit na rodha _h_.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. the remark on I, 58, 7 (note 1).\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. I cannot follow Prof. von Roth (Zeitschrift der D. Morgenl.\nGesellschaft, XLVIII, 116), who explains dadhire as a third person sing. of dh\n_ri_.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The incompleteness both of the construction and of the metre shows\nthat the text of the first Pada is corrupt. I doubt whether it ever will be\npossible to restore the correct reading with full certainty, but I shall be\nglad if others succeed better than I did--and I may add, better than Prof. von\nRoth (Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 117 seq.) seems to me to\nhave succeeded--in correcting and in interpreting the text. I think that after\nsunave\n\np. 51\n\nrodasi clearly one syllable is wanted to complete the Pada: possibly we should\nread therefore sunave rodasyo _h_ (comp. verse 2, Pada 2, arati _h_ rodasyo\n_h_ , which words form the end of the Pada). Agni, as is well known, is the\nson of the two worlds, the sunu _h_ rodasyo _h_. In the beginning of the Pada\nb _ri_ hati\xc2\xb4 must either refer to the two worlds: in this case we have to read\nb _ri_ hatyo _h_ (instead of b _ri_ hati\xc2\xb4 iva); or b _ri_ hati\xc2\xb4 may refer, as\nthis adjective frequently does, to the gira _h_ , and we shall possibly have\nto read b _ri_ hati\xc2\xb4 _h_ va _h_ (as to va _h_ , comp. Delbruck, Altindische\nSyntax, 206). But of course all these are mere guesses. In every case the verb\non which the accusative gira _h_ depends ('we bring,' or something like that)\nmust be supplied.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Or, as the killer of V _ri_ tra. See H. O., Religion des Veda, 135,\nnote 2.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 60](sbe46014.htm)\n\n"
