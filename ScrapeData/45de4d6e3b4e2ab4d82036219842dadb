[1885], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n3:4:1\n\n#### THE \xc3\x82TI _TH_ YA, OR GUEST-OFFERING  \n(HOSPITABLE RECEPTION GIVEN TO KING SOMA).\n\n### FOURTH ADHY\xc3\x82YA. FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n3:4:1:11\\. Verily, the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the\nPraya _n_ iya and Udayaniya are its arms. But the arms are on both sides of\nthe head: therefore those two oblations, the Praya _n_ iya and Udayaniya, are\non both sides of the guest-offering.\n\n3:4:1:22\\. Now as to why it is called 'guest-offering.' He, the purchased\nSoma, truly comes as his (the sacrificer's) guest,--to him (is offered) that\n(hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brahman one would cook a large\nox or a large he-goat--for that is human (fare offered to a guest), and the\noblation is that of the gods--so he prepares for him that guest-offering.\n\n3:4:1:33\\. Here now they say, 'Let him first walk past (Soma) and take out\n(the material for offering)!' For (they argue) where people do not show\nrespect\n\np. 86\n\nto a worthy person (arhant) who has come to them, he becomes angry,--and in\nthis way he (Soma) is indeed honoured.\n\n3:4:1:44\\. Then only one (of the oxen) is to be unyoked, and the other to be\nleft unyoked 1; and thereupon he is to take out (the material for offering):\nfor (they argue) in that one of them is unyoked, thereby he (Soma) has\narrived; and in that the other is left unyoked, thereby he is honoured.\n\n3:4:1:55\\. Let him, however, not do this but let him take out (the material\nfor offering) only after unyoking (both oxen) and after making (Soma) enter\n(the hall); for the ways of men are in accordance with those of the gods. And\naccordingly, in human practice, so long as (a guest) has not unyoked, people\ndo not bring water to him and show him no honour, for so long he has not yet\narrived; but when he has unyoked, then they bring him water and show him\nhonour, for then he has indeed arrived: let him therefore take out (the\nmaterial for offering) only after unyoking and after making (Soma) enter (the\nhall).\n\n3:4:1:66\\. Let him take it out with all speed, for thus he (Soma) is honoured.\nThe housewife holds on to it from behind 2; for the sacrificer holds on to him\n(Soma), while he is driven around, and here his wife does so. Thus they\nenclose him on the two sides by a (married) couple: and, indeed, wherever a\n\np. 87\n\nworthy person comes, there all the inmates of the house bestir themselves, for\nthus he is honoured.\n\n3:4:1:77\\. Let him take out (the material) with a different formula from that\nwherewith (one takes out) any other oblations 1, since, when he (Soma) is\nbought, he is bought for one special destination,--for the sovereignty of the\nmetres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres. The metres act as\nattendants about him; even as the non-royal king-makers, the heralds and\nheadmen, (attend upon) the king, so do the metres act as attendants about him\n(Soma).\n\n3:4:1:88\\. In no wise, then, is it befitting that he should take out any\n(material for offering) solely 'for the metres 2;' for whenever people cook\nfood for some worthy person 3, then the attendants about him, the non-royal\nking-makers, the heralds and headmen, have their share (of the food) assigned\nto them; after (or along with their master): hence, when he takes out that\n(oblation to Soma), let him assign the metres a share in it along with (the\ndeity).\n\n3:4:1:99\\. He takes it out, with the text (Va _g_. S. V, 1), 'Thou art Agni's\nbody,--thee (I take) for Vish _n_ u!' the Gayatri is Agni: to Gayatri he thus\nassigns her share.\n\n3:4:1:1010\\. 'Thou art Soma's body,--thee for Vish _n_ u!' Soma is the\nnobility, and the Trish _t_ ubh\n\np. 88\n\nis the nobility: to Trish _t_ ubh he thus assigns her share.\n\n3:4:1:1111\\. 'Thou art the guest's hospitable entertainment 1,--thee for Vish\n_n_ u!' This is his (Soma's) special share: as there is a special share for a\nchief, so is this his special share apart from the metres.\n\n3:4:1:1212\\. 'Thee for the Soma-bearing falcon! thee for Vish _n_ u!' thereby\nhe assigns to Gayatri her share. Because Gayatri, in the form of a falcon,\ncarried off Soma from the sky, therefore she is the Soma-bearing falcon: in\nvirtue of that heroic deed he now assigns to her a second share.\n\n3:4:1:1313\\. 'Thee for Agni, the bestower of prosperity! thee for Vish _n_ u!'\nProsperity means cattle, and the _G_ agati (the moving, living one) means\ncattle: to _G_ agati he thereby assigns her share.\n\n3:4:1:1414\\. Now as to his taking five times;--the sacrifice is of equal\nmeasure with the year, and five seasons there are in the year: the latter he\ngains in five (divisions);--for this reason he takes five times. And as to his\ntaking it with 'For Vish _n_ u (I take) thee! for Vish _n_ u thee!' it is\nbecause he who takes out (material) for the sacrifice, takes it for Vish _n_\nu.\n\n3:4:1:1515\\. It is a sacrificial cake on nine potsherds;--for the guest-\noffering is the head of the sacrifice, and the Gayatri consists of nine\nsyllables 2: eight (syllables) are those he recites and the sacred syllable 3\nis the ninth; and the Gayatri is the fore-part of the\n\np. 89\n\nsacrifice 1, and so is that (cake) the fore-part of the sacrifice: therefore\nit is a cake on nine potsherds.\n\n3:4:1:1616\\. The enclosing-sticks are of karshmarya wood (Gmelina Arborea 2),\nfor the gods, once upon a time, perceived that one, the karshmarya, to be the\nRakshas-killer among trees. Now, the guest-offering being the head of the\nsacrifice, the enclosing-sticks are of karshmarya wood, in order that the evil\nspirits may not injure the head of the sacrifice.\n\n3:4:1:1717\\. The prastara-bunch 3 is of a _s_ vavala-grass (Saccharum\nSpontaneum). For, once upon a time, the sacrifice escaped from the gods. It\nbecame a horse (a _s_ va) and sped away from them. The gods, rushing after it,\ntook hold of its tail (vala) and tore it out; and having torn it out, they\nthrew it down in a lump, and what had been the hairs of the horse's tail then\ngrew up as those plants (of a _s_ vavala-grass). Now the guest-offering is the\nhead of the sacrifice, and the tail is the hind-part (of animals): hence by\nthe prastara being of a _s_ vavala-grass he encompasses the sacrifice on both\nsides.\n\n3:4:1:1818\\. There are two vidh _ri_ tis 4 of sugar-cane, lest\n\np. 90\n\nthe barhis and the prastara should become mixed up together. Having then\npurified the ghee 1, he takes all the butter-portions in four ladlings 2, for\nat this (sacrifice) there are no after-offerings.\n\n3:4:1:1919\\. When he has placed the sacrificial dishes (on the altar) 3, he\nchurns the fire. For the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice; and in\nchurning (the fire) they produce that (sacrifice); and one who is born is born\nwith the head first: hence he thereby makes the sacrifice to be produced with\nthe head first. Further, Agni means all the gods, since offering is made in\nthe fire to all gods; and the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice:\nhence, through all the deities, he secures success to the sacrifice from the\nvery head (beginning). This is why he churns the fire 4.\n\n3:4:1:2020\\. He takes the bottom piece of wood 5, with the text (Va _g_. S. V,\n2), 'Thou art the birth-place of Agni;' for it is thereon that Agni is\nproduced: hence he says, 'Thou art the birth-place of Agni.'\n\n21\\. Thereon he lays two sprouts of a ku _s_ a stalk (with the tops towards\nthe east), with, 'Ye are\n\np. 91\n\nmales 1;' thereby these two are as two (sons) born together here from a woman.\n\n3:4:1:2222\\. Thereon he lays the lower churning-stick (with the top to the\nnorth), with, 'Thou art Urva _s_ i!' He then touches the (ghee in the) ghee-\npan with the upper churning-stick, with, 'Thou art \xc3\x82yu,' he puts it down (on\nthe lower ara _n_ i) with, 'Thou art Pururavas.' For Urva _s_ i was a nymph,\nand Pururavas was her husband; and the (child) which sprung from that union\nwas \xc3\x82yu 2: in like manner does he now produce the sacrifice from that union.\nThereupon he says (to the Hot _ri_ ), 'Recite to Agni, as he is churned 3!'\n\n3:4:1:2323\\. He churns, with the texts, 'With the Gayatri metre I churn thee!\n--With the Trish _t_ ubh metre I churn thee!--With the Gagati metre I churn\nthee!' For it is with the metres that he churns him (Agni, the fire); the\nmetres he recites to him when he is churned, whereby he attaches the metres to\nthe sacrifice, even as the rays (are attached) to yonder sun.--'Recite to the\nborn one!' he says,\n\np. 92\n\nwhen he (Agni) is produced 1; and 'To him who is thrown 2!' when he throws him\n(on the old \xc3\x82havaniya fire).\n\n3:4:1:2424\\. He throws (the fire on the hearth), with the text (Va _g_. S. V,\n3), 'For our sake be ye two (fires) friendly to one another, of one mind,\nunblemished! Injure not the sacrifice, nor the lord of the sacrifice! be\ngracious unto us this day, ye knowers of beings!' He thus bespeaks\npeacefulness between them, that they may not injure each other.\n\n3:4:1:2525\\. He then takes out some clarified butter with the dipping-spoon,\nand pours it on the fire, with the text (Vag. S. V, 4), 'Agni resorteth to\nAgni, he the son of the seers that shieldeth us from curses: graciously offer\nthou for us now with good offering, never withholding the oblation from the\ngods, Hail!' For the purpose of offering they have produced him, and by this\noffering he has now gratified him: that is why he thus makes offering unto\nhim.\n\n3:4:1:2626\\. It (the guest-offering) ends with the I _d_ a; no after-offerings\nare performed. For the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the\nhead is the fore-part: he thus fits him up as the head of the sacrifice. But\nwere he to perform the after-offerings, it would be as if, by reversing, he\nwere to put the feet in the place of the head. Hence it ends with the I _d_ a,\nand no after-offerings are performed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[86:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_226) This is the practice recognised by the Taittiriyas\n(T. S. VI, 2, 1, 1), on the ground that, if one were to unyoke both oxen, he\nwould interrupt the sacrifice; and if he were to leave them both unyoked, it\nwould be as if a hospitable reception were given to one who has not actually\narrived.\n\n[86:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_227) That is, by touching the Adhvaryu while he takes\nout the sacrificial food. See [p. 79](sbe2614.htm#page_79), note\n[3](sbe2614.htm#fn_210).\n\n[87:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_228) For the ordinary formula with which material for\noffering is taken out at an ish _t_ i, 'At the impulse of the divine Savit\n_ri_ , I take thee with the arms of the A _s_ vins, with the hands of Pushan,\nthee well-pleasing to--!' see I, 1, 2, 17.\n\n[87:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_229) According to Taitt. S. VI, 2, 1, the five portions\nare taken out for the metres Gayatri, Trish _t_ ubh, _G_ agati, Anush _t_ ubh,\nand Gayatri, with the texts, 'Thou art Agni's hospitable feast, for Vish _n_ u\n(I take) thee,' &c.\n\n[87:3](sbe2615.htm#fr_230) 'Arhant' seems rather to mean 'ruler' here.\n\n[88:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_231) Atither atithyam, 'the guest's guest-meal.'\n\n[88:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_232) According to Taitt. S. VI, 2, 1, 4, it is because\nthe head has nine seams, 'navadha _s_ iro vishyutam.'\n\n[88:3](sbe2615.htm#fr_233) The final syllable of the prayers recited in\noffering is protracted and nasalized, a final 'a' becoming o _m_ ,--this\ndrawing out of the syllable is called pra _n_ ava.\n\n[89:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_234) Because the Gayatri metre is connected with the\nprata _h_ savana or morning pressing. See [IV, 2, 5, 20](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:20)\nseq.; Ait. Br. III, 27 seq.\n\n[89:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_235) See I, 3, 3, 19-20, where the approved kinds of\nwood for the paridhis at an ish _t_ i are enumerated.\n\n[89:3](sbe2615.htm#fr_236) For the prastara, or bunch of reed-grass,\nrepresenting the sacrificer, see I, 3, 3, 5 seq.; 8, 3. 11 seq. The a _s_\nvavala (horsetail) grass (generally called ka _s_ a) is said to resemble\nhorse-hair, and is used for twine, mats, thatch, &c. Sir H. M. Elliot, 'Races\nof the N. W. Prov.' II, pp. 371, 372, describes it as growing from three to\nfifteen feet high, and flowering in great profusion after the rains; the base\nof the flowers being surrounded with a bright silvery fleece, which whitens\nthe neighbouring fields so much as frequently to resemble a fall of snow.\n\n[89:4](sbe2615.htm#fr_237) For the vidh _ri_ ti or stalks laid across the\nbarhis (sacrificial p. 90 grass covering the altar), to keep the prastara\nseparate from the latter when laid upon it, see I, 3, 4, 10. As no special\nmention is made of the barhis, the same material has to be used for it as at\nthe model ish _t_ i (New and Full-moon sacrifice), viz. Ku _s_ a grass (Poa\nCynosuroides).\n\n[90:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_238) See I, 3, 1, 22-23.\n\n[90:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_239) See I, 3, 2, 8-9.\n\n[90:3](sbe2615.htm#fr_240) See I, 3, 4, 14.\n\n[90:4](sbe2615.htm#fr_241) On the production of the fire by 'churning,' see\npart i, p. 294, note 3.\n\n[90:5](sbe2615.htm#fr_242) The adhimanthana _s_ akala is a chip of wood used\nfor the lower churning-stick (adharara _n_ i), wherein the upper churning-\nstick is drilled, to rest upon. It is laid down on the altar-grass (barhis)\nfrom south to north. According to Saya _n_ a it is a chip obtained in rough-\nhewing the sacrificial stake.\n\n[91:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_243) In this sense 'v _ri_ sha _n_ au' is taken by\nMahidhara (sektarau, from v _ri_ shan), Saya _n_ a, and apparently also by our\nauthor. Perhaps it means 'testicles' (v _ri_ sha _n_ a) in the text. See [III,\n6, 3, 10](sbe2625.htm#3:6:3:10); and part i, p. 389, note 3.\n\n[91:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_244) The myth of Pururavas and Urva _s_ i is given at\nlength XI, 5, 1, I-17. Compare also Max Muller, Chips, vol. ii, p.202 seq.; A.\nKuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers, p. 78 seq.\n\n[91:3](sbe2615.htm#fr_245) The verses which the Hot _ri_ has to recite are (a)\none to Savit _ri_ (the Vivifier, viz. Rig-veda I, 24, 3); (b) to Heaven and\nEarth (IV, 56, s); (c) a triplet to Agni (VI, 16, 13-15). If fire has not\nappeared by this time, he recites the so-called Rakshas-killing verses (X,\n118), repeating them until fire has been produced. See Ait. Br. I, 17; \xc3\x82 _s_\nv. _S_ r. II, 16.\n\n[92:1](sbe2615.htm#fr_246) The Hot _ri_ recites the two verses, Rig-veda I,\n74, 3; VI, 16, 40.\n\n[92:2](sbe2615.htm#fr_247) The verb is 'pra-h _ri_ ,' which is also the common\nterm for the hurling of the thunderbolt. The six verses, recited by the Hot\n_ri_ ; are Rig-veda VI, 16, 41-42; I, 12, 6; VIII, 43, 14; VIII, 73, 8; I,\n164, 50.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe2616.htm)\n\n"
