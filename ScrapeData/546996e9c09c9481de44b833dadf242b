Ah, grief, that still  \nEager to do my brother's will,  \nMourning thy woman's nature, I  \nMust see thee doubt my truth and die.  \nI fly to Rama's side, and Oh,  \nMay bliss attend thee while I go!  \nMay all attendant wood-gods screen  \nThy head from harm, O large-eyed Queen  \nAnd though dire omens meet my sight  \nAnd fill my soul with wild affright,  \nMay I return in peace and see  \nThe son of Raghu safe with thee!'  \n   The child of Janak heard him speak,  \nAnd the hot tear-drops down her cheek,  \nIncreasing to a torrent, ran,  \nAa thus once more the dame began:  \n'O Lakshman, if I widowed be  \nGodavan's** flood shall cover me,  \nOr I will die by cord, or leap,  \nLife weary, from yon rocky steep;  \n\nOr deadly poison will I drink,  \nOr 'neath the kindled flames will sink,  \nBut never, reft of Rama, can  \nConsent to touch a meaner man.'  \n   The Maithil dame with many sighs,  \nAnd torrents pouring from her eyes,  \nThe faithful Lakshman thus adressed,  \nAnd smote her hands upon her breast.  \nSumitra's son, o'erwhelmed by fears,  \n   Looked on the large-eyed queen:  \n     He saw that flood of burning tears,  \n   He saw that piteous mien.  \n     He yearned sweet comfort to afford,  \n   He strove to soothe her pain  \n     But to the brother of her lord  \n  She spoke no word again.  \n     His reverent hands once more he raised,  \n   His head he slightly bent,  \n     Upon her face he sadly gazed,  \n   And then toward Rama went.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLVI.: The Guest.](ry244.htm)\n\n"
