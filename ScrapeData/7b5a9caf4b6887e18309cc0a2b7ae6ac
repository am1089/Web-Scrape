Matali, though I have done what Indra commanded, I think myself an\nunprofitable servant, when I remember his most gracious welcome.\n\n_Matali_. O King, know that each considers himself the other\'s debtor. For\n\nYou count the service given  \n  Small by the welcome paid,  \nWhich to the king of heaven  \n  Seems mean for such brave aid.\n\n_King_. Ah, no! For the honour given me at parting went far beyond\nimagination. Before the gods, he seated me beside him on his throne. And then\n\nHe smiled, because his son Jayanta\'s heart  \n  Beat quicker, by the self-same wish oppressed,  \nAnd placed about my neck the heavenly wreath  \n  Still fragrant from the sandal on his breast.\n\n_Matali_. But what do you not deserve from heaven\'s king? Remember:\n\nTwice, from peace-loving Indra\'s sway  \nThe demon-thorn was plucked away:  \n  First, by Man-lion\'s crooked claws;  \nAgain, by your smooth shafts to-day.\n\n_King_. This merely proves Indra\'s majesty. Remember:\n\nAll servants owe success in enterprise  \n  To honour paid before the great deed\'s done;  \nCould dawn defeat the darkness otherwise  \n  Than resting on the chariot of the sun?\n\n_Matali_. The feeling becomes you. ( _After a little_.) See, O King! Your\nglory has the happiness of being published abroad in heaven.\n\np. 82\n\nWith colours used by nymphs of heaven  \n  To make their beauty shine,  \nGods write upon the surface given  \n  Of many a magic vine,  \nAs worth their song, the simple story  \nOf those brave deeds that made your glory.\n\n_King_. Matali, when I passed before, I was intent on fighting the demons, and\ndid not observe this region. Tell me. In which path of the winds are we?\n\n_Matali_.\n\nIt is the windpath sanctified  \nBy holy Vishnu\'s second stride;  \nWhich, freed from dust of passion, ever  \nUpholds the threefold heavenly river;  \nAnd, driving them with reins of light,  \nGuides the stars in wheeling flight.\n\n_King_. That is why serenity pervades me, body and soul. ( _He observes the\npath taken by the chariot_.) It seems that we have descended into the region\nof the clouds.\n\n_Matali_. How do you perceive it?\n\n_King_.\n\nPlovers that fly from mountain-caves,  \nSteeds that quick-flashing lightning laves,  \nAnd chariot-wheels that drip with spray--  \nA path o\'er pregnant clouds betray.\n\n_Matali_. You are right. And in a moment you will be in the world over which\nyou bear rule.\n\n_King_ ( _looking down_ ). Matali, our quick descent gives the world of men a\nmysterious look. For\n\nThe plains appear to melt and fall  \nFrom mountain peaks that grow more tall;  \nThe trunks of trees no longer hide  \nNor in their leafy nests abide;  \nThe river network now is clear,  \nFor smaller streams at last appear:  \nIt seems as if some being threw  \nThe world to me, for clearer view.\n\n_Matali_. You are a good observer, O King. ( _He looks down, awe-struck_.)\nThere is a noble loveliness in the earth.\n\np. 83\n\n_King_. Matali, what mountain is this, its flanks sinking into the eastern and\ninto the western sea? It drips liquid gold like a cloud at sunset.\n\n_Matali_. O King, this is Gold Peak, the mountain of the fairy centaurs. Here\nit is that ascetics most fully attain to magic powers. See!\n\nThe ancient sage, Marichi\'s son,  \nChild of the Uncreated One,  \nFather of superhuman life,  \nDwells here austerely with his wife.\n\n_King_ ( _reverently_ ). I must not neglect the happy chance. I cannot go\nfarther until I have walked humbly about the holy one.\n\n_Matali_. It is a worthy thought, O King. ( _The chariot descends_.) We have\ncome down to earth.\n\n_King_ ( _astonished_ ). Matali,\n\nThe wheels are mute on whirling rim;  \n  Unstirred, the dust is lying there;  \nWe do not bump the earth, but skim:  \n  Still, still we seem to fly through air.\n\n_Matali_. Such is the glory of the chariot which obeys you and Indra.\n\n_King_. In which direction lies the hermitage of Marichi\'s son?\n\n_Matali_ ( _pointing_ ). See!\n\nWhere stands the hermit, horridly austere,  \nWhom clinging vines are choking, tough and sere;  \nHalf-buried in an ant-hill that has grown  \nAbout him, standing post-like and alone;  \nSun-staring with dim eyes that know no rest,  \nThe dead skin of a serpent on his breast:  \nSo long he stood unmoved, insensate there  \nThat birds build nests within his mat of hair.\n\n_King_ ( _gazing_ ). All honour to one who mortifies the flesh so terribly.\n\n_Matali_ ( _checking the chariot_ ). We have entered the hermitage of the\nancient sage, whose wife Aditi tends the coral-trees.\n\np. 84\n\n_King_. Here is deeper contentment than in heaven. I seem plunged in a pool of\nnectar.\n\n_Matali_ ( _stopping the chariot_ ). Descend, O King.\n\n_King_ ( _descending_ ). But how will you fare?\n\n_Matali_. The chariot obeys the word of command. I too will descend. (He does\nso.) Before you, O King, are the groves where the holiest hermits lead their\nself-denying life.\n\n_King_. I look with amazement both at their simplicity and at what they might\nenjoy.\n\nTheir appetites are fed with air  \nWhere grows whatever is most fair;  \nThey bathe religiously in pools  \nWhich golden lily-pollen cools;  \nThey pray within a jewelled home,  \nAre chaste where nymphs of heaven roam:  \nThey mortify desire and sin  \nWith things that others fast to win.\n\n_Matali_. The desires of the great aspire high. ( _He walks about and speaks\nto some one not visible_.) Ancient Shakalya, how is Marichi\'s holy son\noccupied? ( _He listens_.) What do you say? That he is explaining to Aditi, in\nanswer to her question, the duties of a faithful wife? My matter must await a\nfitter time. ( _He turns to the king_.) Wait here, O King, in the shade of the\nashoka tree, till I have announced your coming to the sire of Indra.\n\n_King_. Very well. (Exit MATALI. _The king\'s arm throbs, a happy omen_.)\n\nI dare not hope for what I pray;  \n  Why thrill--in vain?  \nFor heavenly bliss once thrown away  \n  Turns into pain.\n\n_A voice behind the scenes_. Don\'t! You mustn\'t be so foolhardy. Oh, you are\nalways the same.\n\n_King_ ( _listening_ ). No naughtiness could feel at home in this spot. Who\ndraws such a rebuke upon himself? ( _He looks towards the sound. In\nsurprise_.) It is a child, but no child in strength. And two hermit-women are\ntrying to control him.\n\np. 85\n\nHe drags a struggling lion cub,  \n  The lioness\' milk half-sucked, half-missed,  \nTowzles his mane, and tries to drub  \n  Him tame with small, imperious fist.\n\n( _Enter a small boy, as described, and two hermit-women_.)\n\n_Boy_. Open your mouth, cub. I want to count your teeth.\n\n_First woman_. Naughty boy, why do you torment our pets? They are like\nchildren to us. Your energy seems to take the form of striking something. No\nwonder the hermits call you All-tamer.\n\n_King_. Why should my heart go out to this boy as if he were my own son? ( _He\nreflects_.) No doubt my childless state makes me sentimental.\n\n_Second woman_. The lioness will spring at you if you don\'t let her baby go.\n\n_Boy_ ( _smiling_ ). Oh, I\'m dreadfully scared. ( _He bites his lip_.)\n\n_King_ ( _in surprise_ ).\n\nThe boy is seed of fire  \n  Which, when it grows, will burn;  \nA tiny spark that soon  \n  To awful flame may turn.\n\n_First woman_. Let the little lion go, dear. I will give you another\nplaything.\n\n_Boy_. Where is it? Give it to me. ( _He stretches out his hand_.)\n\n_King_ ( _looking at the hand_.) He has one of the imperial birthmarks! For\n\nBetween the eager fingers grow  \n  The close-knit webs together drawn,  \nLike some lone lily opening slow  \n  To meet the kindling blush of dawn.\n\n_Second woman_. Suvrata, we can\'t make him stop by talking. Go. In my cottage\nyou will find a painted clay peacock that belongs to the hermit-boy Mankanaka.\nBring him that.\n\n_First woman_. I will. ( _Exit_.)\n\np. 86\n\n_Boy_. Meanwhile I\'ll play with this one.\n\n_Hermit-woman_ ( _looks and laughs_ ). Let him go.\n\n_King_. My heart goes out to this wilful child. ( _Sighing_.)\n\nThey show their little buds of teeth  \n  In peals of causeless laughter;  \nThey hide their trustful heads beneath  \n  Your heart. And stumbling after  \nCome sweet, unmeaning sounds that sing  \n  To you. The father warms  \nAnd loves the very dirt they bring  \n  Upon their little forms.\n\n_Hermit-woman_ ( _shaking her finger_ ). Won\'t you mind me?\n\n( _She looks about_.) Which one of the hermit-boys is here?\n\n( _She sees the king_.) Oh, sir, please come here and free this lion cub. The\nlittle rascal is tormenting him, and I can\'t make him let go.\n\n_King_. Very well. ( _He approaches, smiling_.) O little son of a great sage!\n\nYour conduct in this place apart,  \nIs most unfit;  \n\'Twould grieve your father\'s pious heart  \nAnd trouble it.\n\nTo animals he is as good  \nAs good can be;  \nYou spoil it, like a black snake\'s brood  \nIn sandal tree.\n\n_Hermit-woman_. But, sir, he is not the son of a hermit.\n\n_King_. So it would seem, both from his looks and his actions. But in this\nspot, I had no suspicion of anything else. ( _He loosens the boy\'s hold on the\ncub, and touching him, says to himself_.)\n\nIt makes me thrill to touch the boy,  \n  The stranger\'s son, to me unknown;  \nWhat measureless content must fill  \n  The man who calls the child his own!\n\n_Hermit-woman_ ( _looking at the two_ ). Wonderful! wonderful!\n\n_King_. Why do you say that, mother?\n\np. 87\n\n_Hermit-woman_. I am astonished to see how much the boy looks like you, sir.\nYou are not related. Besides, he is a perverse little creature and he does not\nknow you. Yet he takes no dislike to you.\n\n_King_ ( _caressing the boy_ ). Mother, if he is not the son of a hermit, what\nis his family?\n\n_Hermit-woman_. The family of Puru.\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ). He is of one family with me! Then could my thought be\ntrue? ( _Aloud_.) But this is the custom of Puru\'s line:\n\nIn glittering palaces they dwell  \nWhile men, and rule the country well;  \nThen make the grove their home in age,  \nAnd die in austere hermitage.\n\n[paragraph continues] But how could human beings, of their own mere motion,\nattain this spot?\n\n_Hermit-woman_. You are quite right, sir. But the boy\'s mother was related to\na nymph, and she bore her son in the pious grove of the father of the gods.\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ). Ah, a second ground for hope. ( _Aloud_.) What was\nthe name of the good king whose wife she was?\n\n_Hermit-woman_. Who would speak his name? He rejected his true wife.\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ). This story points at me. Suppose I ask the boy for\nhis mother\'s name. ( _He reflects_.) No, it is wrong to concern myself with\none who may be another\'s wife. ( _Enter the first woman, with the clay\npeacock_.)\n\n_First woman_. Look, All-tamer. Here is the bird, the shakunta. Isn\'t the\nshakunta lovely?\n\n_Boy_ ( _looks about_ ). Where is my mamma? ( _The two women burst out\nlaughing_.)\n\n_First woman_. It sounded like her name, and deceived him. He loves his\nmother.\n\n_Second woman_. She said: "See how pretty the peacock is." That is all.\n\n_King_ ( _to himself_ ). His mother\'s name is Shakuntala! But names are alike.\nI trust this hope may not prove a disappointment in the end, like a mirage.\n\n_Boy_. I like this little peacock, sister. Can it fly? ( _He seizes the toy_.)\n\np. 88\n\n_First woman_ ( _looks at the boy. Anxiously_ ). Oh, the amulet is not on his\nwrist.\n\n_King_. Do not be anxious, mother. It fell while he was struggling with the\nlion cub. ( _He starts to pick it up_.)\n\n_The two women_. Oh, don\'t, don\'t! ( _They look at him_.) He has touched it! (\n_Astonished, they lay their hands on their bosoms, and look at each other_.)\n\n_King_. Why did you try to prevent me?\n\n_First woman_. Listen, your Majesty. This is a divine and most potent charm,\ncalled the Invincible. Marichi\'s holy son gave it to the baby when the birth-\nceremony was performed. If it falls on the ground, no one may touch it except\nthe boy\'s parents or the boy himself.\n\n_King_. And if another touch it?\n\n_First woman_. It becomes a serpent and stings him.\n\n_King_. Did you ever see this happen to any one else?\n\n_Both women_. More than once.\n\n_King_ ( _joyfully_ ). Then why may I not welcome my hopes fulfilled at last?\n( _He embraces the boy_.)\n\n_Second woman_. Come, Suvrata. Shakuntala is busy with her religious duties.\nWe must go and tell her what has happened. ( _Exeunt ambo_.)\n\n_Boy_. Let me go. I want to see my mother.\n\n_King_. My son, you shall go with me to greet your mother.\n\n_Boy_. Dushyanta is my father, not you.\n\n_King_ ( _smiling_ ). You show I am right by contradicting me. ( _Enter_\nSHAKUNTALA, _wearing her hair in a single braid_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _doubtfully_ ). I have heard that All-tamer\'s amulet did not\nchange when it should have done so. But I do not trust my own happiness. Yet\nperhaps it is as Mishrakeshi told me. ( _She walks about_.)\n\nKing ( _looking at_ SHAKUNTALA. _With plaintive joy_ ). It is she. It is\nShakuntala.\n\nThe pale, worn face, the careless dress,  \n  The single braid,  \nShow her still true, me pitiless,  \n  The long vow paid.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _seeing the king pale with remorse. Doubtfully_ ). It is not my\nhusband. Who is the man that soils my boy with his caresses? The amulet should\nprotect him.\n\np. 89\n\n_Boy_ ( _running to his mother_ ). Mother, he is a man that belongs to other\npeople. And he calls me his son.\n\n_King_. My darling, the cruelty I showed you has turned to happiness. Will you\nnot recognise me?\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _to herself_ ). Oh, my heart, believe it. Fate struck hard, but\nits envy is gone and pity takes its place. It is my husband.\n\n_King_.\n\nBlack madness flies;  \n  Comes memory;  \nBefore my eyes  \n  My love I see.\n\nEclipse flees far;  \n  Light follows soon;  \nThe loving star  \n  Draws to the moon.\n\n_Shakuntala_. Victory, victo----- ( _Tears choke her utterance_.)\n\n_King_.\n\nThe tears would choke you, sweet, in vain;  \n  My soul with victory is fed,  \nBecause I see your face again--  \n  No jewels, but the lips are red.\n\n_Boy_. Who is he, mother?\n\n_Shakuntala_. Ask fate, my child. ( _She weeps_.)\n\n_King_.\n\nDear, graceful wife, forget;  \n  Let the sin vanish;  \nStrangely did madness strive  \n  Reason to banish.\n\nThus blindness works in men,  \n  Love\'s joy to shake;  \nSpurning a garland, lest  \n  It prove a snake. ( _He falls at her feet_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_. Rise, my dear husband. Surely, it was some old sin of mine that\nbroke my happiness--though it has turned again to happiness. Otherwise, how\ncould you, dear, have acted so? You are so kind. ( _The king rises_.) But what\nbrought back the memory of your suffering wife?\n\np. 90\n\n_King_. I will tell you when I have plucked out the dart of sorrow.\n\n\'Twas madness, sweet, that could let slip  \nA tear to burden your dear lip;  \nOn graceful lashes seen to-day,  \nI wipe it, and our grief, away.\n\n( _He does so_.)\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _sees more clearly and discovers the ring_ ). My husband, it is\nthe ring!\n\n_King_. Yes. And when a miracle recovered it, my memory returned.\n\n_Shakuntala_. That was why it was so impossible for me to win your confidence.\n\n_King_. Then let the vine receive her flower, as earnest of her union with\nspring.\n\n_Shakuntala_. I do not trust it. I would rather you wore it. ( _Enter_\nMATALI.)\n\n_Matali_. I congratulate you, O King, on reunion with your wife and on seeing\nthe face of your son.\n\n_King_. My desires bear sweeter fruit because fulfilled through a friend.\nMatali, was not this matter known to Indra?\n\n_Matali_ ( _smiling_ ). What is hidden from the gods? Come. Marichi\'s holy\nson, Kashyapa, wishes to see you.\n\n_King_. My dear wife, bring our son. I could not appear without you before the\nholy one.\n\n_Shakuntala_. I am ashamed to go before such parents with my husband.\n\n_King_. It is the custom in times of festival. Come. ( _They walk about_.\nKASHYAPA _appears seated, with_ ADITI.)\n\n_Kashyapa_ ( _looking at the king_ ). Aditi,\n\n\'Tis King Dushyanta, he who goes before  \n  Your son in battle, and who rules the earth,  \nWhose bow makes Indra\'s weapon seem no more  \n  Than a fine plaything, lacking sterner worth.\n\n_Aditi_. His valour might be inferred from his appearance.\n\n_Matali_. O King, the parents of the gods look upon you with a glance that\nbetrays parental fondness. Approach them.\n\np. 91\n\n_King_. Matali,\n\nSprung from the Creator\'s children, do I see  \nGreat Kashyapa and Mother Aditi?  \nThe pair that did produce the sun in heaven,  \nTo which each year twelve changing forms are given;  \nThat brought the king of all the gods to birth,  \nWho rules in heaven, in hell, and on the earth;  \nThat Vishnu, than the Uncreated higher,  \nChose as his parents with a fond desire.\n\n_Matali_. It is indeed they.\n\n_King_ ( _falling before them_ ). Dushyanta, servant of Indra, does reverence\nto you both.\n\n_Kashyapa_. My son, rule the earth long.\n\n_Aditi_. And be invincible. (SHAKUNTALA _and her son fall at their feet_.)\n\n_Kashyapa_. My daughter,\n\nYour husband equals Indra, king  \n  Of gods; your son is like his son;  \nNo further blessing need I bring:  \n  Win bliss such as his wife has won.\n\n_Aditi_. My child, keep the favour of your husband. And may this fine boy be\nan honour to the families of both parents. Come, let us be seated. ( _All seat\nthemselves_.)\n\n_Kashyapa_ ( _indicating one after the other_ ).\n\nFaithful Shakuntala, the boy,  \n  And you, O King, I see  \nA trinity to bless the world--  \n  Faith, Treasure, Piety.\n\n_King_. Holy one, your favour shown to us is without parallel. You granted the\nfulfilment of our wishes before you called us to your presence. For, holy one,\n\nThe flower comes first, and then the fruit;  \n  The clouds appear before the rain;  \nEffect comes after cause; but you  \n  First helped, then made your favour plain.\n\n_Matali_. O King, such is the favour shown by the parents of the world.\n\np. 92\n\n_King_. Holy one, I married this your maid-servant by the voluntary ceremony.\nWhen after a time her relatives brought her to me, my memory failed and I\nrejected her. In so doing, I sinned against Kanva, who is kin to you. But\nafterwards, when I saw the ring, I perceived that I had married her. And this\nseems very wonderful to me.\n\nLike one who doubts an elephant,  \n  Though seeing him stride by,  \nAnd vet believes when he has seen  \n  The footprints left; so I.\n\n_Kashyapa_. My son, do not accuse yourself of sin. Your infatuation was\ninevitable. Listen.\n\n_King_. I am all attention.\n\n_Kashyapa_. When the nymph Menaka descended to earth and received Shakuntala,\nafflicted at her rejection, she came to Aditi. Then I perceived the matter by\nmy divine insight. I saw that the unfortunate girl had been rejected by her\nrightful husband because of Durvasas\' curse. And that the curse would end when\nthe ring came to light.\n\n_King_ ( _with a sigh of relief. To himself_ ). Then I am free from blame.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _to herself_ ). Thank heaven! My husband did not reject me of\nhis own accord. He really did not remember me. I suppose I did not hear the\ncurse in my absent-minded state, for my friends warned me most earnestly to\nshow my husband the ring.\n\n_Kashyapa_. My daughter, you know the truth. Do not now give way to anger\nagainst your rightful husband.\n\nRemember:\n\nThe curse it was that brought defeat and pain;  \nThe darkness flies; you are his queen again.  \nReflections are not seen in dusty glass,  \nWhich, cleaned, will mirror all the things that pass.\n\n_King_. It is most true, holy one.\n\n_Kashyapa_. My son, I hope you have greeted as he deserves the son whom\nShakuntala has borne you, for whom I myself have performed the birth-rite and\nthe other ceremonies.\n\n_King_. Holy one, the hope of my race centres in him.\n\np. 93\n\n_Kashyapa_. Know then that his courage will make him emperor.\n\nJourneying over every sea,  \nHis car will travel easily;  \nThe seven islands of the earth  \nWill bow before his matchless worth;  \nBecause wild beasts to him were tame,  \nAll-tamer was his common name;  \nAs Bharata he shall be known,  \nFor he will bear the world alone.\n\n_King_. I anticipate everything from him, since you have performed the rites\nfor him.\n\n_Aditi_. Kanva also should be informed that his daughter\'s wishes are\nfulfilled. But Menaka is waiting upon me here and cannot be spared.\n\n_Shakuntala_ ( _to herself_ ). The holy one has expressed my own desire.\nKashyapa. Kanva knows the whole matter through his divine insight. ( _He\nreflects_.) Yet he should hear from us the pleasant tidings, how his daughter\nand her son have been received by her husband. Who waits without? ( _Enter a\npupil_.)\n\n_Pupil_. I am here, holy one.\n\n_Kashyapa_. Galava, fly through the air at once, carrying pleasant tidings\nfrom me to holy Kanva. Tell him how Durvasas\' curse has come to an end, how\nDushyanta recovered his memory, and has taken Shakuntala with her child to\nhimself.\n\n_Pupil_. Yes, holy one. ( _Exit_.)\n\n_Kashyapa_ ( _to the king_ ). My son, enter with child and wife the chariot of\nyour friend Indra, and set out for your capital.\n\n_King_. Yes, holy one.\n\n_Kashyapa_. For now\n\nMay Indra send abundant rain,  \nRepaid by sacrificial gain;  \nWith aid long mutually given,  \nRule you on earth, and he in heaven.\n\n_King_. Holy one, I will do my best.\n\np. 94\n\n_Kashyapa_. What more, my son, shall I do for you?\n\n_King_. Can there be more than this? Yet may this prayer be fulfilled.\n\nMay kingship benefit the land,  \nAnd wisdom grow in scholars\' band;  \nMay Shiva see my faith on earth  \nAnd make me free of all rebirth.\n\n( _Exeunt omnes_.)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Story of Shakuntala](sha12.htm)\n\n'
