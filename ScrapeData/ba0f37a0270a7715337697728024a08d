Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! Hearing the words of Yama, the chaste\nintelligent Savitri, replied with great devotion :-- \xc2\x93O Dharmarajan! What is\nKarma? Why and how is its origin? What is the cause of Karma? Who is the\nembodied soul (bound by Karma)? What is this body? And who is it that does\nKarma? What is J\xc3\xb1ana? What is Buddhi? What is this Pra _n_ a of this embodied\nJiva? What are the Indriyas? And what are their characteristics? And what are\nthe Devatas thereof? Who is it that enjoys and who is it that makes one enjoy?\nWhat is this enjoyment (Bhoga)? And what is the means of escape from it? And\nwhat is the nature of that State when one escapes from enjoyment? What is the\nnature of Jivatma? And what of Paramatma? O Deva! Speak all these in detail to\nme.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n5-21. Dharma said :-- Karma is of two kinds: good and bad. The Karma that is\nstated in the Vedas as leading to Dharma is good; all other actions are bad.\nThe God\xc2\x92s service, without any selfish ends (Sankalpa) and without the hope of\nany fruits thereof (ahaituki), is of such a nature as to root out all the\nKarmas and gives rise to the highest devotion to God. A man who is such a\nBhakta of Brahma becomes liberated, so the S\xc2\x92rutis say. Who then does the\nKarma and who is it that enjoys? (i.e., no such body). To such a Bhakta to\nBrahma, there is no birth, death, old age, disease, sorrow nor any fear. O\nChaste One! Bhakti is two-fold. This is stated by all in the S\xc2\x92rutis. The one\nleads to Nirva _n_ a and the other leads to the nature of Hari. The Vai _sn_\navas want the Bhakti to Hari, i.e., the Sagu _n_ a Bhakti. The other Yogis and\nthe best knowers of Brahma want the Nirgu _n_ a Bhakti. He who is the Seed of\nKarma, and the Bestower for ever the fruits of Karma, Who is the Karma\nIncarnate and the Mula Prakriti, is the Bhagavan; He is the Highest Self. He\nis the Material Cause of Karma. Know this body to be by nature liable to\ndissolve and die. Earth, air, akas\xc2\x92a, water, and fire; these are the threads,\nas it were, of the work of creation of Brahma, Who is of the nature of Being.\n\xc2\x93Dehi\xc2\x94 or The Embodied Soul is the Doer of Karma, the Karta; he is the\nenjoyer; and \xc3\x82tma (self) is the prompter, the stimulator within to do the\nKarma and enjoy the fruits thereof. The experiencing of pleasures and pains\nand the varieties thereof is known as Bhoga (enjoyment). Liberation, Mukti is\nthe escape therefrom.\n\n\n\np. 913\n\n\n\nThe knowledge by which \xc3\x82tma (sat) and Maya (Asat) are discriminated is called\nJ\xc3\xb1anam (Brahma J\xc3\xb1anam). The knowledge is considered as the root discriminator\nof various objects of enjoyments (i.e., by which the various objects are at\nonce recognised as different from \xc3\x82tman). By Buddhi is meant the right seeing\nof things, (as certain) and is considered as the seed of J\xc3\xb1anam. By Pra _n_ a\nis known as the different Vayus in the body. And this Pra _n_ a is the\nstrength of the embodied. Mind is the chief, the best, of the senses, it is a\npart of \xc3\x8es\xc2\x92vara; its characteristic is its doubtful uncertain state. It impels\nto all actions, irresistible. It is inascertainable, invisible; it obstructs\nthe J\xc3\xb1ana. The senses are seeing, hearing, smelling, touching and tasting.\nThese are the several limbs, as it were, of the embodied and the impellers to\nall actions. They are both enemies and friends as they give pain (when\nattached to worldly objects) and happiness (when attached to virtuous objects)\nboth. The Sun, Vayu, Earth, Brahma and others are their Devatas. The Jiva is\nthe holder, the sustainer of Pra _n_ a, body, etc. The Paramatma, the Highest\nSelf, is the Best of all, Omnipresent, transcending the the Gu _n_ as, and\nbeyond Prakriti. He is the Cause of all causes and He is the Brahma Itself. O\nChaste One! I have replied, according to the S\xc2\x92astras to all your questions.\nThese are J\xc3\xb1anas of the J\xc3\xb1anins. O Child! Now go back to your house at\npleasure.\n\n\n\n22-30. Savitri said :-- Whither shall I go, leaving my Husband and Thee, the\nOcean of Knowledge? Please oughtest to answer the queries that I now put to\nThee. What wombs do the Jivas get in response to which Karmas? What Karmas\nlead to the Heavens? And what Karmas lead to various hells? Which Karmas lead\nto Mukti? And which Karmas give Bhakti? What Karmas make one Yogi and what\nKarmas inflict diseases? Which Karmas make one\xc2\x92s life long? or short? Which\nKarmas again make one happy? And what Karmas make one miserable? Which Karmas\nmake one deformed in one\xc2\x92s limbs, one-eyed, blind, deaf, lame or idiotic?\nWhich Karmas again make one mad? Make one very much avaricious or of a\nstealing habit? What Karmas make one possess Siddhis? Or make one earn the\nfour Lokas Salokya, etc.? What Karmas make one a Brahmi _n_ or an ascetic? Or\nmake one go to Heaven or Vaiku _nt_ ha? What Karmas enable one to go to\nGoloka, the par excellence and free from all diseases? How many are the hells?\nWhat are their names and how do they appear? How long will one have to remain\nin each hell? and what Karmas lead to what diseases? O Deva, now tell me about\nthese that I have asked to you and oblige.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-Eighth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the story of Savitri\nin S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 29](bk09ch29.htm)\n\n"
