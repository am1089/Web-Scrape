When the horse was slaughtered, the life-sap 4 went out of it; it\nbecame the A _s_ vastomiya (set of oblations 5): when he offers the A _s_\nvastomiya (oblations) he indeed supplies the horse with life-sap.\n\n13:3:6:22\\. He performs it with ghee; for ghee is life-sap, and the A _s_\nvastomiya is life-sap: by means of life-sap\n\np. 342\n\nhe thus puts life-sap into it. He performs with ghee, for that--to wit, ghee--\nis the favourite resource of the gods: he thus supplies them with their\nfavourite resource.\n\n13:3:6:33\\. Having performed the A _s_ vastomiya (set of) oblations, he offers\nthe Dvipadas 1; for the A _s_ vastomiya is the horse, and the Dvipada is man,\nfor man is two-footed (dvipad), supported on two (feet): he thus supplies him\nwith a support.\n\n13:3:6:44\\. Concerning this they say, 'Is the A _s_ vastomiya to be offered\nfirst, or the Dvipada?' The A _s_ vastomiya, surely, is cattle, and the\nDvipada is man: inasmuch as he performs the Dvipadas after performing the A\n_s_ vastomiya, man subsequently establishes himself amongst cattle.\n\n13:3:6:55\\. Sixteen A _s_ vastomiya oblations he performs, for animals\n(cattle) consist of sixteen parts 2: that is the measure of cattle, and he\nthus supplies cattle with their (right) measure; Were he to offer either less\nor more, he would deprive cattle of their (right) measure. Sixteen he offers,\nfor cattle consist of sixteen parts: that is the measure of cattle, and he\nthus supplies cattle with their (right) measure. He offers no other as a final\noblation 3: were he to offer another as a final oblation, he would lose\n\np. 343\n\nhis support. The Dvipadas he offers last, for Dvipadas are a support: he thus\nfinds a support (establishes himself). With, 'To _G_ umbaka hail!' he offers,\nat the purificatory bath, the last oblation 1; for _G_ umbaka is Varu _n_ a:\nby sacrifice he thus manifestly redeems himself from Varu _n_ a. He offers it\non the head of a white-spotted 2, baldheaded (man) with protruding teeth 3 and\nreddish brown eyes; for that is Varu _n_ a's form: by (that) form (of his) he\nthus redeems himself from Varu _n_ a.\n\n13:3:6:66\\. Having stepped out (of the water) he prepares twelve messes of\ncooked rice for the priests, or performs twelve ish _t_ is. Concerning this\nthey say, 'These to wit, ish _t_ is--are a form of sacrifice: were he to\nperform ish _t_ is, the sacrifice would be ready to incline towards him; but\nhe would become the worse for it, for, surely, of exhausted strength now are\nthe metres (offering formulas) of him who has performed the Soma-\nsacrifice;--how could he make use of them so soon? For when the sacrifice is\ncomplete, Va _k_ (speech and sacred writ 4) is wholly gained, and, being\ngained, it now is exhausted in strength, and, as it were, wounded and mangled;\nbut sacrifice is speech: hence he should not make use of it.'\n\np. 344\n\n13:3:6:77\\. Having stepped out (of the water) he should certainly prepare\ntwelve messes of rice for the priests; for cooked rice is Pra _g_ apati, and\nPra _g_ apati is the year, Pra _g_ apati is the sacrifice: it is the year, the\nsacrifice, he thus gains, and the sacrifice becomes ready to incline towards\nhim, and he does not become the worse for it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[341:4](sbe44099.htm#fr_875) Or, sacrificial essence.\n\n[341:5](sbe44099.htm#fr_876) See [p. 336](sbe44097.htm#page_336), note\n[2](sbe44097.htm#fn_856).\n\n[342:1](sbe44099.htm#fr_877) The formulas of the six dvipadas--i.e. (verses)\nconsisting of two padas--are found Va _g_.

XXV, 46-47.\n\n[342:2](sbe44099.htm#fr_878) See [XII, 8, 3, 13](sbe44070.htm#12:8:3:13); for\na highly artificial explanation of the sixteen parts of the man Pra _g_ apati,\nprobably intended here, X, 4, 1, 17. Elsewhere those of animals are explained\nas including head, neck, trunk, tail, the four legs and eight claws; see\nWeber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 111, note.\n\n[342:3](sbe44099.htm#fr_879) This would seem to be directed against the\npractice of performing the oblation to Heaven and Earth immediately after the\nA _s_ vastomiyas, see [p. 336](sbe44097.htm#page_336), note\n[2](sbe44097.htm#fn_856).\n\n[343:1](sbe44099.htm#fr_880) See [p. 336](sbe44097.htm#page_336), note\n[1](sbe44097.htm#fn_855).\n\n[343:2](sbe44099.htm#fr_881) ? Or, pale. Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. Br. III, 9, 15,\n3, explains ' _s_ ukla' by ' _k_ itrin' (? having white spots, or affected\nwith white leprosy). Harisvamin does not explain the word.\n\n[343:3](sbe44099.htm#fr_882) Harisvamin explains 'viklidha' by 'dantura,' i.e.\none who has projecting teeth; whilst Saya _n_ a, l.c., explains it by either\n'given to perspiring (svedana _s_ ila _s_ arira),' or 'moist-bodied (?\nleprous, or, old, in bodily decay, viklinnadeha).'\n\n[343:4](sbe44099.htm#fr_883) Cf.
