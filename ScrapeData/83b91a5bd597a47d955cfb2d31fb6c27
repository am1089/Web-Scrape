[1](ry298.htm#fn_610)  \nWhy do mine eyes no more behold  \nThy bright beloved chain of gold,  \nWhich, pleased with thee, the Immortals' King  \nAbout thy neck vouchsafed to fling?  \nStill lingering on thy lifeless face  \nI see the pride of royal race:  \nThus when the sun has set his glow  \nStill rests upon the Lord of Snow.  \nAlas my hero! undeterred  \nThou wouldst not listen to my word.  \nWith tears and prayers I sued in vain:  \nThou wouldst not listen, and art slain.  \nGone is my bliss, my glory: I  \nAnd Angad now with thee will die.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXIV.: Sugriva's Lament.](ry298.htm)\n\n"
