The Upanishads,\nhowever, indicate no definite method for arriving at the perception of this\ntruth. It is made clear that the pathway consists not in erudition or\nscholarship, and that it is not traversed by any sharpness of intelligence.\nThe truth is such that it cannot be conceived by the human mind or described\nby language. One of the fundamental conditions of attaining it is the complete\nelevation of the moral life, including the absolute control of all passions\nand desires, the abandonment of worldly ambitions and hopes, and the\nattainment of an unruffled peace of mind. But the dawning of the supra-\nconsciousness which can reveal this truth does not, even so, depend entirely\non our own efforts; there is something like divine mercy that must be awaited.\nThis self can only be realized by those to whom it reveals itself. The\nperfecting of our moral life is a prerequisite; but no method deliberately and\nconsciously pursued is sufficient to bring us all the way into the full\nrealization of the highest truth. In at least one or two of the Upanishads\nindications of a\n\np. 62\n\ndifferent line of thought and method of realization are to be found. Thus in\nKatha III, our senses are compared with horses which are always running after\ntheir respective sense-objects. He who is not wise but is without control over\nhis own mind cannot control his senses, just as a bad driver cannot control\nhis horses. If anyone wishes to make his way to his highest goal, he should\nhave wisdom for his driver and his mind as the reins of the horses of the\nsenses. In Katha VI, it is said that there is a state in which the five\nsenses, thought, intellect, and mind all cease to operate, and this highest\nstage of absolute sense-restraint is called "Yoga," or spiritual union. 1\n\nThere are ample literary evidences that from very early times--from at least\n700 or 800 B. C.--people were in the habit of concentrating their minds on\nparticular objects and thereby stopping the movement of the mind and the\nsenses and achieving wonderful, miraculous powers. It is difficult to say how\nthe ancient Indians discovered this mode of mental control. But it seems very\nprobable that as at first practised it did not form a part of any metaphysical\nsystem of thought but was simply the practise of mental concentration and\nbreath control for the sake of the resulting peace and quietness of mind, as\nwell as of the miraculous powers which could be achieved thereby. The powers\nof hypnotism, or mesmerism, seem to have been very well known in ancient India\nand were also included among the powers that could be derived from the yoga\npractices. 2\n\nA story is told in the Mahabharata (13.40) that\n\np. 63\n\n[paragraph continues] Devasharma, a sage, had a very beautiful wife, named\nRuci, whom he carefully guarded from the seductive influences of Indra who\ndesired to possess her. Once he had to go away to perform sacrifices at a\ndistant place, and he left his wife under the protection of his pupil Vipula.\nThe pupil knew that Indra could resort to many clever disguises and that it\nwould be difficult to protect Ruci from him by guarding her by any external\nmeans. So he decided to enter into her mind by his powers of yoga and to\ncontrol her behavior and speech from within. Accordingly, he sat in front of\nhis teacher\'s wife and remained staring at her eyes, inhibiting all movements\nof his own body. In this way he entered into her body and remained there\nawaiting his teacher\'s return. Nov Indra, thinking that the lady was alone in\nthe house, came there in his fine and radiant form. He saw there the inanimate\nbody of Vipula, the pupil, with its eyes absolutely motionless as if they were\npainted on canvas. He also saw the lady sitting there in all her resplendent\nbeauty. On beholding Indra, she wished to rise and greet him; but being\ncontrolled from within by her husband\'s pupil, she could not succeed in doing\nas she desired. Indra spoke to her in his own charming manner, telling her\nthat he had come there for her and that he was Indra. Perceiving that the lady\nwas showing signs of becoming fascinated, Vipula controlled all her senses and\nlimbs from within in such a way that, though she desired very much by rising\nfrom her seat to receive Indra, she could not do so. When Indra found her\nsilent and unresponsive, he again spoke to her and\n\np. 64\n\nasked her to rise and receive him. Again, though she wanted to welcome him,\nVipula controlled her speech so that she told Indra that he had no business to\ncome to her, and she was ashamed that she so spoke against her will. Indra\nthen understood the whole affair and was much afraid. Vipula then returned to\nhis own body and took Indra to task for his misbehavior. 3\n\nMany other stories, illustrating the various kinds of miraculous powers of\nyoga, might be repeated. But let us turn to a consideration of the principal\nuse of the yoga practices for the spiritual enlightenment, the ultimate and\nabsolute freedom of man, as described by Patanjali, the great yoga writer of\nabout 150 B. C. Patanjali not only describes the principal yoga practices, but\nhe gives a philosophical basis to the whole system and indicates, for the\nfirst time, how yoga may be utilized for the emancipation of man from the\nbondage of his mind and senses. It was explained in the last lecture that the\nsages of the Upanishads believed in a supra-conscious experience of pure self-\nillumination as the ultimate principle, superior to and higher than any of our\nmental states of cognition, willing, or feeling. The nature of this principle\nis itself extremely mystical; many persons, no doubt, are unable to grasp its\ncharacter. It has been shown that, even in the days of the Upanishads, it was\nrecognized to be obscure, and that the sages were never tired of saying that\nit could neither be perceived by the eye nor conceived in thought; but that,\nnevertheless, the sages believed in its existence as the ultimate being and\nnot as an experience of ecstatic feeling or any other kind of transient\n\np. 65\n\npsychological state. It was regarded as the real self and the ultimate\nreality. It is this view of self that is the root, as it were, of Indian\nmysticism. 4\n\nIf we ask ourselves what we understand by "I," we shall all find that, though\nit is in the most constant use, it is also the obscurest word in all our\ndictionaries. About the meaning of the word, in one sense we can never doubt;\nfor there is no person who can ever doubt whether he is himself or another\nperson. But when we try to understand what it definitely and actually means,\nit appears to be one of the most elusive of words. It certainly cannot\ndesignate merely our bodies; nor does it mean any particular idea or feeling\nof a temporary character. So we have to admit that while we all understand\nwhat it means we cannot define it. This is not the place to enter into all the\nrecondite philosophical discussions to which the problem of the nature of the\nself has given rise. But some attempt must be made to explain what the Indians\nunderstood by the immortal and unchangeable self. Some believed this self to\nbe the same in all persons, while others believed it to be many; but the\nconception of its nature was more or less the same in most of the systems of\nIndian thought. It was pure, contentless consciousness, altogether different\nfrom what we understand by idea, knowledge, or thought. Our thoughts and\nfeelings are changeful; but this mysterious light of pure consciousness was\nchangeless. The ultimate aim of the yoga processes (as of most of the Indian\nsystems of thought) is to dissociate ourselves from our sensations, thoughts,\nideas, feelings, etc., to learn\n\np. 66\n\nthat these are extraneous associations, foreign to the nature of self but\nadhering to it almost so inseparably that the true self cannot be easily\ndiscovered as a separate and independent entity. 5\n\nBut with the Indian sages this doctrine of a transcendent self was not merely\na matter of speculative philosophy. For philosophy came to them much later\nthan the actual practice of the liberation of this true self from the bondage\nof the association with all our so-called psychical states, ideas, feelings,\nemotions, images and concepts. It is very difficult for a Western mind of\ntoday to understand, or appreciate, the minds of the Indian seers. They felt a\ncall from within the deep caverns of their selves--a call which must have\nstarted from a foretaste of their own true essence--which made all earthly\npleasures or hopes of heavenly pleasures absolutely distasteful to them. They\ncould feel satisfied only if they could attain this true freedom, their true\nself. To appreciate their experience at all one must, in imagination, take a\nlong jump backward of about twenty-five centuries and across the waters of the\nAtlantic and the Indian oceans, and picture to oneself the valley of the lofty\nsnow-capped peaks of the Himalayas looking high up to the infinite of the\nheavens and, far beyond, the peaceful groves and cottages where the innocence\nand forbearance of man had endeared him to trees and beasts alike, where no\nother sounds disturbed the serene forest-dwellers than the breezy rustling of\nthe lofty Sal trees and the grovy palms. The necessities of the men who dwelt\nthere were few. They often wore clothes made from\n\np. 67\n\nbirch bark, and ate fruits and vegetables that grew wild in the hermitage and\nrice which grew without much trouble of cultivation. The cows of the hermitage\nsupplied them with milk and butter. They did not take any animal life for\nfood; the birds ate from their hands, the soft-eyed gazelles roamed about\ntheir huts, made of straw or leaves of trees, and the peacocks danced in the\nshady groves of their forest walks. The clear, transparent waters of the holy\nriver Ganges and other rivers watered their hermitages, and the cool breezes\ndelightfully refreshed their bodies and minds when the wearisome tropical heat\nhad relaxed their nerves and muscles into inaction. These men had no riches,\nand they did not seek them. Their natural needs were few, and it never\noccurred to them that these could be augmented or multiplied. They thought,\nrather, that what needs they had were in themselves too numerous and could be\nindefinitely curtailed. Even in rather recent times a story is told to the\neffect that a scholar in Bengal, called Ramnath, was visited by Raja\nKrishnachandra of Bengal who wanted to bestow riches on him and asked him if\nhe had any wants. The scholar replied that he had plenty of rice in his house\nand that he could make his soup out of the sour leaves of the tamarind tree\nwhich grew in his yard; the only difficulty that he had was with regard to\nsome intellectual problems which he was still not able to solve. For men who\nlive in a world of sky-scrapers, motor cars and comforts of all sorts, with\nits varied scientific, political and social ambitions, with its desire for\nwealth and its highly developed system of trade\n\np. 68\n\nand commerce, it is inevitably difficult to appreciate, or rightly understand,\nthe minds of those who felt disinclined to all worldly things and were uneasy\nuntil they could touch their own inmost self. Theirs, however, was no ordinary\npessimism, as is too often supposed by unsympathetic and shallow-minded\nscholars, who lack the imagination and the will to understand the Indian\nthought and culture of the past. They felt dissatisfied with the world not\nbecause the world had no pleasures or joys to offer, but because their desire\nfor attaining their highest good, their true selves, was so great that it\ncould tolerate no compromise with any other kind of desire. The sole ambition\nof the yogins, or the seers who practised the yoga discipline, was to become\nabsolutely free from all kinds of bonds and from all kinds of extraneous\ndetermination. 6\n\nThe problem of how to become free naturally raised the question as to who is\nto become free and from what. The logic of the yogins is irresistible. It is\nthe self which has to become free; in fact it is always free. The self is the\nultimate principle of pure consciousness, distinct from all mental functions,\nfaculties, powers, or products. By a strange, almost inexplicable, confusion\nwe seem to lose touch with the former so that we consider it as non-existent\nand characterize the latter with its qualities. It is this confusion which is\nat the root of all our psychological processes. All mental operations involve\nthis confusion by which they usurp the place of the principle of pure\nconsciousness so that it is only the mind and the mental operations of\nthought, feeling, willing, which seem to be\n\np. 69\n\nexisting, while the ultimate principle of consciousness is lost sight of. If\nwe call this ultimate principle of consciousness, this true self, "spirit" and\ndesignate all our functions of knowing, feeling, and willing collectively as\n"mind," then we may say that it is only by a strange confusion of mind with\nspirit that the mind comes to the forefront and by its activities seems to\nobscure the true light of the spirit. Our senses run after their objects and\nthe mind establishes relations between the sense-data, or sensations, and\ndeals with the concepts formed therefrom as it carries on the processes of\nlogical thought with the aid of memory. The external objects which draw minds\nto them are not in themselves directly and immediately responsible for\nobscuring the spirit or in binding it to them. It is, rather, the mind and its\nactivities by which the true nature of the spirit seems to be obscured so that\nthe mind usurps the rightful place of the spirit. What is necessary,\ntherefore, is to control the activities of the mind and to stop all mental\nprocesses. If we can in this way kill the mind, all logical thought and all\nsense processes will be killed with it. The light of the spirit will then\nshine alone by itself unshadowed by the darkening influence of thought. The\nspirit, the ultimate principle of consciousness, and the self are one and the\nsame thing, the three terms expressing the threefold aspect of its nature. But\nthis entity, by whichever name it is called, is to be distinguished from mind,\nwhose activities are thoughts, feelings, etc. We may here employ a simile. We\nmay say that the spirit is like a pure white light covered by the colored dome\n\np. 70\n\nof the mind. This colored dome hides the pure white light, and, without\nchanging the nature of the white light by its own color, makes the latter\nappear as colored and wrongfully appears itself to be a source of colored\nlight, though it has no light whatsoever of itself. We fail to recognize the\nwhite light within and take it for granted that the colored dome is itself a\ncolored light. The only way to restore the purity of the white light is by\nsmashing the colored dome. Similarly, the only way in which the spirit may be\nmade to realize, in its own non-conceptual way, its own lonely light is by\nbreaking the mind to pieces. 7\n\nThe mind lives by its activities of sensing, perceiving and conceiving. It\ncreates illusions and hallucinations, revives past experiences in memory, and\nsometimes passes into a state of sleep in which it creates dreams. If the\nmovement of the mind could be entirely stopped, its disintegration would be\neffected. The process of yoga consists in so controlling the activity of the\nmind that it ceases to pass through its different states. The cessation of all\nmental states is yoga. These mental states as they rise and pass away are not\naltogether lost. They continue in the subconscious mind as impressions which\nare revived by proper excitations. As they are thus revived and repeated, and\nreturn to the subconscious, the impressions become strengthened, growing more\nand more powerful and more likely to occur as conscious states. Thus, for\nexample, when we once devote ourselves to making money and to enjoying the\ncomforts it can procure, we become more and more deeply absorbed in\n\np. 71\n\nearning money and enjoying its comforts. Similarly, the scholar through days\nand nights of study in his library grows ever more attached to his occupation\nof study. It is in this way that the tendencies of the mind become\nstrengthened; repeating themselves almost mechanically they keep alive the\ncontinual flow of the mind from one state to another. Yoga consists in\nstopping the conscious and subconscious mental flow entirely and absolutely. 8\n\nIt is easy to see that no one will think of destroying his mind unless his\ndesire for the absolute freedom of the spirit becomes so great that all the\nactivities of the mind, all his sense-enjoyments, all his thoughts and\nfeelings, lose all interest for him and appear to him to be entirely\nvalueless. This disinclination to all worldly things, called _vairagya_ , is\nthe first thing which leads the yogin to seek the way of yoga to deliver\nhimself forever from all mundane experiences. The seer is as sensitive as the\npupil of the eye. Just as a speck of dust, which passes altogether unnoticed\non any other part of the body, causes great pain when it gets into the eye, so\nthe suffering, which is absolutely unnoticed by the ordinary person, is felt\nkeenly by the seer. All ordinary pleasures appear to be distasteful to him.\nThere is nothing in anything worldly that can give him any satisfaction. He is\nin that mood in which he is dissatisfied with them all and wishes to shun\nthem. 9\n\nSuch a state of mind cannot be produced unless the mind has risen to the\nhighest plane of moral elevation. Unless the mind is made absolutely pure\nthere cannot be any steady disinclination toward worldly things.\n\np. 72\n\n[paragraph continues] A seer must abstain from all injury to living beings.\nHis tenderness should extend not only to all human individuals but to all\nliving beings. He would not willfully take the life of, or injure, any living\nbeing. He would not steal the property of any other person. He would be\nabsolutely truthful in thought, word and deed. Veracity consists in the\nagreement of words and thoughts with facts. But it must always be employed for\nthe good of others and not for their injury. If it proves injurious to living\nbeings, with whatever intention it be uttered it is not truth. Though\noutwardly such a truthful course may be considered virtuous yet since by his\ntruth he has caused injury to another he has in reality violated the ideal of\nabsolute non-injury. The seer must have a complete control of the sex\ntendencies. He must not desire anything more than the bare necessities. For\nthe acquisition of things always entails attachment and greed, and injury to\nothers in acquiring and preserving them. If in performing the great duty of\nuniversal non-injury, and in cultivating the other virtues auxiliary to it, a\nman be troubled by thoughts of sin, he should try to substitute for the sinful\nideas those which are contrary to them. Thus, if the old habit of sin tends to\ndrive him along the wrong path, he should, in order to banish it, entertain\nideas such as the following:--"Being burnt up as I am in the fires of the\nworld, I have taken refuge in the practice of yoga, which gives protection to\nall. Were I to resume the sins which I have abandoned, I should certainly be\nbehaving like a dog which eats its own vomit--I should be acting as if I were\nto take up\n\np. 73\n\nagain that which I had once put aside." Thus one should habituate himself to\nmeditation upon the harmful effects of the tendencies which are leading him\nalong the wrong path. The habituation to this contrary tendency consists in\ncontinually thinking that these immoral tendencies cause an infinity of pain\nand error. Pain and error are the unending fruits of these immoral tendencies\nand in the recognition of this lies the power of righting the trend of our\nthoughts. 10\n\nOther moral qualities of a positive character are considered indispensable to\na seer toiling on the path of yoga. These are: purity, contentment,\nindifference to physical difficulties of heat, cold, etc., study and self-\nsurrender to God. Purity here means both physical and mental cleanliness.\nContentment means that self-satisfied condition of the mind in which we are at\npeace with ourselves, having ceased to run after new wants. Indifference to\nphysical difficulties is also a virtue to be acquired by the yogin, who should\nbe able to bear calmly the bodily wants of hunger and thirst, heat and cold.\nHe should also be able to stop his physical movements for a considerable\nlength of time, and be able, as well, to stop his desire to talk with others\nand to remain absolutely dumb. 11\n\nIn the last lecture, on the Upanishadic mysticism, it was shown that when such\na high standard of moral elevation is reached and we seek to know the inmost\nessence of self, the self often reveals its own true nature through a direct\nintuition which is beyond the grasp of the mind and the senses. The yogins,\nhowever,\n\np. 74\n\nnot only emphasized the necessity of the highest moral perfection but they\nalso required a particular course of physical and mental discipline as\nindispensable to the realization of yoga\'s high ideal. The yogins emphasized\nnot only the negative aspect of morality, such as abstinence from injury,\nfalsehood and the like, but also such positive moral virtues as purity and\ncontentment. The four cardinal virtues which a yogin was required to possess\nwere universal friendship ( _maitri_ ), compassion for all who suffer (\n_karuna_ ), happiness in the happiness of others ( _mudita_ ), and a\nsympathetic consideration for the failings of others ( _upeksha_ ). But even\nthese were not deemed sufficient; they were only preliminary acquirements\nwhich the yogin must possess before starting with his yoga practices. The\nacquisition of these moral virtues went, indeed, a long way in restraining the\nmind from running after sense-objects and from being disturbed by greed,\npassions and antipathies; for the yogin was self-controlled, contented, pure\nin mind and body, and peaceable and charitable toward all living beings. But\nstill he must be able to control his bodily movements. He must therefore\nhabituate himself to sitting in one posture for a long time, not only for\nhours and days but often for months and years together. This implied the\nattainment of a power to bear calmly hunger and thirst, heat and cold, and all\nphysical hardships. 12\n\nIn order that the movement in the body may be reduced to a minimum, it is\nnecessary to acquire a control over breathing. To practice the science of\nbreath-control, the yogin seats himself firmly, fixes his eyes\n\np. 75\n\non an object beyond him, or rather on the tip of his own nose or on the point\nbetween his two eye-brows, and slowly inhales a full breath. At first the\nbreath that is taken in is kept perhaps for a minute and then slowly exhaled.\nThe practice is continued for days and months, the period of the retention of\nthe breath taken in being gradually increased. With the growth of breath-\ncontrol, one may keep his breath suspended, without exhalation or inhalation,\nfor hours, days, months and even years together. With the suspension of the\nrespiratory process the body remains in a state of suspended animation,\nwithout any external signs of life. The heart ceases to beat, there is neither\ntaking in of food nor evacuation of any sort, there is no movement of the\nbody. There is a complete cessation of the respiratory process as, with his\nmouth shut and his tongue turned backwards behind the tonsils stopping the\npassage of air firmly like a lid, the yogin sits in his fixed posture in an\napparently lifeless condition. Even in modern times there are many well-\nattested cases of yogis who can remain in this apparently lifeless condition\nfor more than a month. I have myself seen a case where the yogin stayed in\nthis condition for nine days. The case of Saint Haridas is well-known. He\nremained buried underneath the ground for forty days under strict vigilance of\nguards. When, after forty days of breathless and foodless condition of\nsuspended animation, he was brought out of the earth, there was apparently no\nlife in him, no movement of breath, no heart-beats. But after his body had\nbeen rubbed and much water had been\n\np. 76\n\npoured on him he again came back to life and began to breathe normally. 13\n\nVarious methods of purifying the body were gradually discovered by which the\nyogin could so temper the body as to make it immune to diseases. In earlier\ntimes, before the elaborate bodily disciplines had been discovered, the yogin\nprayed to God and depended on His grace for the immunity from disease which\nwas so necessary to the proper performance of his yoga duties. But later on,\nthe yogin tried to be more or less independent of God\'s grace and discovered a\nwhole system of bodily exercises, breathing exercises, and automatic internal\nwashings by which his body became so tempered that no diseases could easily\nattack him. These consisted, first, in habituating the body to keeping fixed\npostures which required various muscular movements. By this means the yogin\ncould make his body flexible, reduce its unnecessary fat, and attain full\ncontrol over his voluntary muscles. For these postures required the exercise\nof all the voluntary muscles. Second, through the breathing exercises which\ncould be performed in different forms and in different degrees of intensity,\ncombined with the different postures, the yogin obtained control over the\nvarious involuntary muscles which regulate the operation of the viscera,\nincluding the bladder and the excretory organs, the heart, the stomach, etc.\nAdded to these was, third, the thorough washing away of the impurities which,\nbeing secreted by some of the internal organs, obstruct their normal activity\nand lower their power of resistance. These washings can be\n\np. 77\n\neasily performed by the control that the yogin acquires over his inner\ninvoluntary muscles. Thus, for example, the yogin can take water into the\nintestines by expelling air from these cavities and thus forcing in water by\nthe downward path from a tub in which he may be sitting at the time. He can\nexpel air from these cavities by means of the control that he has over the\nmuscles of those organs which to a normal person are quite involuntary. Thus,\nat any time that he likes he can thoroughly wash his stomach, his bladder,\nurethra, etc. He has thus a thorough access to all the important cavities of\nthe body where impurities may be produced and deposited. In short, by the\ncombined operation of postures, breath-control, breathing exercises, and the\nvoluntary washings of the impurities from all the important cavities of the\nbody, he can so increase his power of physical resistance as to remain\npractically immune to all diseases. 14\n\nBut these are all merely external preparations to fit the body for the yoga\npractices. The real yoga practice of the mind can be properly begun only when\nthese preliminaries have been to a large extent acquired so that the chances\nof external bodily disturbances and internal disturbances due to passions,\nantipathies, attachments, etc., have been minimized. The yogin begins this\nsuperior mental yoga by concentrating at first on any gross physical object.\nThis concentration is not the ordinary concentration of thought as exemplified\nin any scientific or literary work. For this latter type of concentration\nconsists in the limiting of the mind\'s activity to matters associated with the\nobject\n\np. 78\n\nof attention. Thus, if we concentrate on the writing of a poem or the\ndescription of scenery, what we do is to restrain the mind from flying off to\nother objects in which we are not interested at the time and to focus it upon\nthe relations between various associated images and thoughts. The mind is in\nsuch cases in a lively state of movement within a limited sphere, always\nseeking to discover new relations or to intensify the comprehension of\nrelations and facts already known. But yoga concentration aims not to discover\nany new relations or facts or to intensify any impression; it aims solely to\nstop the movement of mind and to prevent its natural tendency towards\ncomparison, classification, association, assimilation and the like. The fixing\nof the mind on an object is done I with the specific purpose of pinning it to\nthat object and of preventing its transition to any other object. By this\nprocess the mind becomes one with the object, and so long as it is pinned to\nthat object its movement is stopped. At the first stage of this union, there\nis knowledge of the name and the physical form of the object to which the mind\nhas been pinned. But at the next stage nothing is known of the object in its\nordinary relations of name and form, but the mind becomes one with the object,\nsteady and absolutely motionless. This state is called a state of _samadhi_ ,\nor absorptive concentration. This stage arises when the mind by its steadiness\nbecomes one with its object, divested of all associations of name and concept,\nso that it is in direct touch with the reality of the thing uncontaminated by\nassociations. In this state, the object\n\np. 79\n\ndoes not appear as an object of _my_ consciousness but my consciousness,\nbecoming divested of all "I" or "mine," becomes one with the object itself.\nThere is no awareness here that "I know this," but, the mind having become one\nwith the thing, the duality of subject and object disappears, and the result\nis the transformation of the mind into the object of its concentration. Our\nordinary knowledge of things is full of false and illusory associations which\ndo not communicate to us the real nature of the object; but when such an\nabsorptive union of object and mind takes place, a new kind of intuition is\nproduced, called _prajna_ , similar to the Upanishadic intuition, called\n_prajnana_ , and thereby the real nature of the thing is brought home to us.\nThis _prajna_ knowledge, which is a new kind of intuition produced by stopping\nthe movement of the mind, is entirely different from the ordinary logical type\nof cognition of thoughts, images, etc. This intuition is a direct\nacquaintance, more or less similar to direct perceptual vision but free from\nthe ordinary errors of all sense-perception. Such a steadiness can however be\nachieved only after continual practice. A yogin must be always watchful,\nparticularly in the first stages, to keep his mind steadily on the object of\nhis concentration. He must have, therefore, an inexhaustible fund of active\nenergy ( _virya_ ). 15\n\nOn the negative side we have, therefore, disinclination to worldly things; on\nthe positive side, firm faith in the efficacy of the yoga process and vigorous\nenergy exercised in steadying the mind in contemplation. Gradually, as the\nyogin becomes more proficient, he selects\n\np. 80\n\nsubtler and finer objects for his concentration; and at each stage in this\nrefinement, new forms of intuitional prajna, or yoga knowledge, dawn. With\'\nthis advancement, the yogin develops many miraculous powers over natural\nobjects and over the minds of men. Truths wholly unknown to others become\nknown to him. Though all these powers confirm his faith in the yoga process,\nhe does not allow himself to be led away by their acquisition, but steadily\nproceeds toward that ultimate stage in which his mind will be disintegrated\nand his self will shine forth in its own light and he himself will be\nabsolutely free in bondless, companionless loneliness of self-illumination. 16\n\nThis _prajna_ , or yoga intuitional knowledge, may be considered as a new\ndimension of knowledge wholly different from any other kind of knowledge\nderived by the movement of the mind. The most fundamental characteristic of\nyoga mysticism consists, on its negative side, not only in a disbelief in the\nability of sense-perception and logical thought to comprehend the ultimate\ntruth about the absolute purity and unattached character of our true self; but\nalso in a disbelief in the possibility of the realisation of this highest\ntruth so long as the mind itself is not destroyed. On its positive side, it\nimplies that intuitional wisdom is able to effect a clear realisation of truth\nby gradually destroying the so-called intellect. The destruction of mind, of\ncourse, also involves the ultimate destruction of this intuition itself. So\nneither the intuition nor our ordinary logical thought is able to lead us\nultimately to self-realisation. There are thus\n\np. 81\n\nthree stages of knowledge. First, our ordinary sense-knowledge and logical\nthought which always deal with the world and worldly objects and which appear\nvalueless to us when we are in spiritual exaltation and are anxious to attain\nthe highest truth. Second, the intuitional yoga wisdom, which can only be\nattained when, as a result of the highest moral elevation and the yoga\npractices, the mind can be firmly steadied on an object so that it becomes one\nwith that object and all its movements completely cease. This yoga wisdom\ngives us a direct non-conceptual vision of, or acquaintance with, the ultimate\ntruths concerning all objects on which our minds may be concentrated; and\ngradually, as the yogin begins to concentrate on subtler and finer objects,\nsuch as mind, self, etc., higher and nobler truths concerning these become\nknown to him. Though we are free to concentrate on any object whatsoever, it\nis desirable for the quicker attainment of our goal that we should concentrate\non God--surrender ourselves to Him. In the most advanced state of this yoga\nintuition, all the truths regarding the nature of the true self, of the mind\nand of the material world and its connection with mind, become clear, and as a\nresult of this and also as a result of the gradual weakening of the\nconstitution of the mind, the latter ceases to live and work and is\ndissociated forever from the spirit or the self. It is then that the spirit\nshines forth in its own lonely splendor, free from the bondage of the mind\nwhich had so long by its activities led it towards false worldly attachments\nand to a false non-appearance of its own pure nature\n\np. 82\n\nin all the varied products of ordinary knowledge, feeling and willing which\nmake up our worldly life. The highest and ultimate revelation of truth is\ntherefore not only non-conceptual and non-rational, but also non-intuitional\nand non-feeling. It is a self-shining which is unique. 17\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Lecture IV. Buddhistic Mysticism](hm06.htm)\n\n'
