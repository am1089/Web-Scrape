The power of words to\ndenote things cannot be ascertained in any way but by observing the speech and\nactions of experienced people. Now as such speech and action always implies\nthe idea of something to be done (karya), words are means of knowledge only\nwith reference to things to be done; and hence the matter inculcated by the\nVeda also is only things to be done. From this it follows that the Vedanta-\ntexts cannot claim the position of authoritative means of knowledge with\nregard to Brahman, which is (not a thing to be done but) an accomplished fact.\n--Against this view it must not be urged that in the case of sentences\nexpressive of accomplished facts--as e.g. that a son is born to somebody--the\nidea of a particular thing may with certainty be inferred as the cause of\ncertain outward signs--such as e.g. a pleased expression of countenance--which\nare generally due to the attainment of a desired object; for the possible\ncauses of joy, past, present, and future, are infinite in number, and in the\ngiven case other causes of joy, as e.g. the birth having taken place in an\nauspicious moment, or having been an easy one, &c., may easily be imagined.\nNor, again, can it be maintained that the denotative power of words with\nregard to accomplished things may be ascertained in the way of our inferring\neither the meaning of one word from the known meaning of other words, or the\nmeaning of the radical part of a word from the known meaning of a formative\nelement; for the fact is that we are only able to infer on the basis of a\ngroup of words known to denote a certain thing to be done, what the meaning of\nsome particular constituent of that group may be.--Nor, again, when a person,\nafraid of what he thinks to be a snake, is observed\n\np. 149\n\nto dismiss his fear on being told that the thing is not a snake but only a\nrope, can we determine thereby that what terminates his fear is the idea of\nthe non-existence of a snake. For there are many other ideas which may account\nfor the cessation of his fear--he may think, e.g., 'this is a thing incapable\nof moving, devoid of poison, without consciousness'--the particular idea\npresent to his mind we are therefore not able to determine.--The truth is that\nfrom the fact of all activity being invariably dependent on the idea of\nsomething to be done, we learn that the meaning which words convey is\nsomething prompting activity. All words thus denoting something to be done,\nthe several words of a sentence express only some particular action to be\nperformed, and hence it is not possible to determine that they possess the\npower of denoting their own meaning only, in connexion with the meaning of the\nother words of the sentence.--(Nor must it be said that what moves to action\nis not the idea of the thing to be done, but the idea of the means to do it;\nfor) the idea of the means to bring about the desired end causes action only\nthrough the idea of the thing to be done, not through itself; as is evident\nfrom the fact that the idea of means past, future, and even present (when\ndivorced from the idea of an end to be accomplished), does not prompt to\naction. As long as a man does not reflect 'the means towards the desired end\nare not to be accomplished without an effort of mine; it must therefore be\naccomplished through my activity'; so long he does not begin to act. What\ncauses activity is thus only the idea of things to be done; and as hence words\ndenote such things only, the Veda also can tell us only about things to be\ndone, and is not therefore in a position to give information about the\nattainment of an infinite and permanent result, such result being constituted\nby Brahman, which is (not a thing to be done, but) an accomplished entity. The\nVeda does, on the other hand, actually teach that mere works have a permanent\nresult ('Imperishable is the merit of him who offers the _k_ aturmasya-\nsacrifices,' and so on); and hence it follows that to enter on an\n\np. 150\n\nenquiry into Brahman for the reason that the knowledge of Brahman has an\ninfinite and permanent result, while the result of works is limited and non-\npermanent, is an altogether unjustified proceeding.\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--To set aside the universally known mode\nof ascertaining the connexion of words and their meanings, and to assert that\nall words express only one non-worldly meaning (viz. those things to be done\nwhich the Veda inculcates), is a proceeding for which men paying due attention\nto the means of proof can have only a slight regard. A child avowedly learns\nthe connexion of words and meanings in the following way. The father and\nmother and other people about him point with the finger at the child's mother,\nfather, uncle, &c, as well as at various domestic and wild animals, birds,\nsnakes, and so on, to the end that the child may at the same time pay\nattention to the terms they use and to the beings denoted thereby, and thus\nagain and again make him understand that such and such words refer to such and\nsuch things. The child thus observing in course of time that these words of\nthemselves give rise to certain ideas in his mind, and at the same time\nobserving neither any different connexion of words and things, nor any person\narbitrarily establishing such connexion, comes to the conclusion that the\napplication of such and such words to such and such things is based on the\ndenotative power of the words. And being taught later on by his elders that\nother words also, in addition to those learned first, have their definite\nmeaning, he in the end becomes acquainted with the meanings of all words, and\nfreely forms sentences conveying certain meanings for the purpose of imparting\nthose meanings to other persons.\n\nAnd there is another way also in which the connexion of words and things can\neasily be ascertained. Some person orders another, by means of some expressive\ngesture, to go and inform Devadatta that his father is doing well, and the man\nordered goes and tells Devadatta 'Your father is doing well.' A by-stander who\nis acquainted with the meaning of various gestures, and thus knows on what\n\np. 151\n\nerrand the messenger is sent, follows him and hears the words employed by him\nto deliver his message: he therefore readily infers that such and such words\nhave such and such a meaning.--We thus see that the theory of words having a\nmeaning only in relation to things to be done is baseless. The Vedanta-texts\ntell us about Brahman, which is an accomplished entity, and about meditation\non Brahman as having an unlimited result, and hence it behoves us to undertake\nan enquiry into Brahman so as fully to ascertain its nature.\n\nWe further maintain that even on the supposition of the Veda relating only to\nthings to be done, an enquiry into Brahman must be undertaken. For 'The Self\nis to be seen, to be heard, to be reflected on, to be meditated on' (B _ri_.\nUp. II, 4, 5); 'He is to be searched out, him we must try to understand' (\n_Kh_. Up. VIII, 7, 1); 'Let a Brahma _n_ a having known him practise wisdom'\n(B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 21); 'What is within that small ether, that is to be\nsought for, that is to be understood' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1,1); 'What is in that\nsmall ether, that is to be meditated upon' (Mahanar. Up. X, 7)--these and\nsimilar texts enjoin a certain action, viz. meditation on Brahman, and when we\nthen read 'He who knows Brahman attains the highest,' we understand that the\nattainment of Brahman is meant as a reward for him who is qualified for and\nenters on such meditation. Brahman itself and its attributes are thus\nestablished thereby only--that they subserve a certain action, viz.\nmeditation. There are analogous instances in the Karmaka _nd_ a of the Veda.\nWhen an arthavada-passage describes the heavenly vorld as a place where there\nis no heat, no frost, no grief, &c., this is done merely with a view to those\ntexts which enjoin certain sacrifices on those who are desirous of the\nheavenly world. Where another arthavada says that 'those who perform certain\nsattra-sacrifices are firmly established,' such 'firm establishment' is\nreferred to only because it is meant as the reward for those acting on the\ntext which enjoins those sattras, 'Let him perform the ratri-sattras' (Pu. Mi.\nSu. IV, 3, 17). And where a text says that a person threatening a Brahma _n_ a\nis to be punished with\n\np. 152\n\na fine of one hundred gold pieces, this statement is made merely with\nreference to the prohibitory passage, 'Let him not threaten a Brahma _n_\na'(Pu. Mi. Su. III, 4, 17).\n\nWe, however, really object to the whole theory of the meaning of words\ndepending on their connexion with 'things to be done,' since this is not even\nthe case in imperative clauses such as 'bring the cow.' For you are quite\nunable to give a satisfactory definition of your 'thing to be done '(karya).\nYou understand by 'karya' that which follows on the existence of action (k\n_ri_ ti) and is aimed at by action. Now to be aimed at by action is to be the\nobject(karman) of action, and to be the object of action is to be that which\nit is most desired to obtain by action (according to the grammarian's\ndefinition). But what one desires most to obtain is pleasure or the cessation\nof pain. When a person desirous of some pleasure or cessation of pain is aware\nthat his object is not to be accomplished without effort on his part, he\nresolves on effort and begins to act: in no case we observe an object of\ndesire to be aimed at by action in any other sense than that of its\naccomplishment depending on activity. The prompting quality (prerakatva) also,\nwhich belongs to objects of desire, is nothing but the attribute of their\naccomplishment depending on activity; for it is this which moves to action.--\nNor can it be said that 'to be aimed at by action' means to be that which is\n'agreeable' (anukula) to man; for it is pleasure only that is agreeable to\nman. The cessation of pain, on the other hand, is not what is 'agreeable' to\nman. The essential distinction between pleasure and pain is that the former is\nagreeable to man, and the latter disagreeable (pratikula), and the cessation\nof pain is desired not because it is agreeable, but because pain is\ndisagreeable: absence of pain means that a person is in his normal condition,\naffected neither with pain nor pleasure. Apart from pleasure, action cannot\npossibly be agreeable, nor does it become so by being subservient to pleasure;\nfor its essential nature is pain. Its being helpful to pleasure merely causes\nthe resolve of undertaking it.--Nor, again, can we define that which is aimed\nat by action as that to which action is\n\np. 153\n\nauxiliary or supplementary ( _s_ esha), while itself it holds the position of\nsomething principal to be subserved by other things ( _s_ eshin); for of the\n_s_ esha and _s_ eshin also no proper definition can be given. It cannot be\nsaid that a _s_ esha is that which is invariably accompanied by an activity\nproceeding with a view to something else, and that the correlate of such a _s_\nesha is the _s_ eshin; for on this definition the action is not a _s_ esha,\nand hence that which is to be effected by the action cannot be the correlative\n_s_ eshin. And moreover a _s_ eshin may not be defined as what is correlative\nto an action proceeding with a view to--i. e. aiming at--something else; for\nit is just this 'being aimed at' of which we require a definition, and\nmoreover we observe that also the _s_ eshin (or 'pradhana') is capable of\naction proceeding with a view to the _s_ esha, as when e.g. a master does\nsomething for--let us say, keeps or feeds--his servant. This last criticism\nyou must not attempt to ward off by maintaining that the master in keeping his\nservant acts with a view to himself (to his own advantage); for the servant in\nserving the master likewise acts with a view to himself.--And as, further, we\nhave no adequate definition of 'karya,' it would be inappropriate to define\n_s_ esha as that which is correlative to karya, and _s_ eshin as that which is\ncorrelative to _s_ esha.--Nor, finally, may we define 'that which is aimed at\nby action' as that which is the final end (prayo _g_ ana) of action; for by\nthe final end of an action we could only understand the end for which the\nagent undertakes the action, and this end is no other than the desired object.\nAs thus 'what is aimed at by action' cannot be defined otherwise than what is\ndesired, karya cannot be defined as what is to be effected by action and\nstands to action in the relation of principal matter (pradhana or _s_ eshin).\n\n(Let it then be said that the 'niyoga,' i.e. what is commonly called the\napurva--the supersensuous result of an action which later on produces the\nsensible result--constitutes the prayo _g_ ana--the final purpose--of the\naction.--But) the apurva also can, as it is something different from the\ndirect objects of desire, viz. pleasure and the cessation of pain, be viewed\nonly as a means of bringing about these\n\np. 154\n\ndirect objects, and as something itself to be effected by the action; it is\nfor this very reason that it is something different from the action, otherwise\nthe action itself would be that which is effected by the action. The thing to\nbe effected by the action-which is expressed by means of optative and\nimperative verbal forms such as ya _g_ eta, 'let him sacrifice '--is, in\naccordance with the fact of its being connected with words such as svargakama\n_h_ , 'he who is desirous of heaven', understood to be the means of bringing\nabout (the enjoyment of) the heavenly world; and as the (sacrificial) action\nitself is transitory, there is assumed an altogether 'new' or 'unprecedented'\n(apurva) effect of it which (later on) is to bring about the enjoyment of\nheaven. This so-called 'apurva' can therefore be understood only with regard\nto its capability of bringing about the heavenly world. Now it certainly is\nludicrous to assert that the apurva, which is assumed to the end of firmly\nestablishing the independent character of the effect of the action first\nrecognised as such (i.e. independent), later on becomes the means of realising\nthe heavenly world; for as the word expressing the result of the action (ya\n_g_ ta) appears in syntactical connexion with 'svargakama _h_ ' (desirous of\nheaven), it does not, from the very beginning, denote an independent object of\naction, and moreover it is impossible to recognise an independent result of\naction other than either pleasure or cessation of pain, or the means to bring\nabout these two results.--What, moreover, do you understand by the apurva\nbeing a final end (prayo _g_ ana)?-You will perhaps reply, 'its being\nagreeable like pleasure.'--Is then the apurva a pleasure? It is pleasure alone\nwhich is agreeable!--Well, let us then define the apurva as a kind of pleasure\nof a special nature, called by that name!--But what proof, we ask, have you\nfor this? You will, in the first place, admit yourself that you do not\ndirectly experience any pleasure springing from consciousness of your apurva,\nwhich could in any way be compared to the pleasure caused by the consciousness\nof the objects of the senses.--Well, let us say then that as authoritative\ndoctrine gives us the notion of an apurva as\n\np. 155\n\nsomething beneficial to man, we conclude that it will be enjoyed later on.--\nBut, we ask, what is the authoritative doctrine establishing such an apurva\nbeneficial to man? Not, in the first place, ordinary, i.e. non-Vedic doctrine;\nfor such has for its object action only which always is essentially painful.\nNor, in the next place, Vedic texts; for those also enjoin action only as the\nmeans to bring about certain results such as the heavenly world. Nor again the\nSm _ri_ ti texts enjoining works of either permanent or occasional obligation;\nfor those texts always convey the notion of an apurva only on the basis of an\nantecedent knowledge of the apurva as intimated by Vedic texts containing\nterms such as svargakama _h_. And we, moreover, do not observe that in the\ncase of works having a definite result in this life, there is enjoyment of any\nspecial pleasure called apurva, in addition to those advantages which\nconstitute the special result of the work and are enjoyed here below, as e.g.\nabundance of food or freedom from sickness. Thus there is not any proof of the\napurva being a pleasure. The arthavada-passages of the Veda also, while\nglorifying certain pleasurable results of works, as e.g. the heavenly world,\ndo not anywhere exhibit a similar glorification of a pleasure called apurva.\n\nFrom all this we conclude that also in injunctory sentences that which is\nexpressed by imperative and similar forms is only the idea that the meaning of\nthe root--as known from grammar--is to be effected by the effort of the agent.\nAnd that what constitutes the meaning of roots, viz. the action of sacrificing\nand the like, possesses the quality of pleasing the highest Person, who is the\ninner ruler of Agni and other divinities (to whom the sacrifices are\nostensibly offered), and that through the highest Person thus pleased the\nresult of the sacrifice is accomplished, we shall show later on, under Su.\nIII, 2, 37--It is thus finally proved that the Vedanta-texts give information\nabout an accomplished entity, viz. Brahman, and that the fruit of meditation\non Brahman is something infinite and permanent. Where, on the other hand,\nScripture refers to the fruit of mere works, such as the _k_ aturmasya-\nsacrifices,\n\np. 156\n\nas something imperishable, we have to understand this imperishableness in a\nmerely relative sense, for Scripture definitely teaches that the fruit of all\nworks is perishable.\n\nWe thus arrive at the settled conclusion that, since the fruit of mere works\nis limited and perishable, while that of the cognition of Brahman is infinite\nand permanent, there is good reason for entering on an enquiry into Brahman--\nthe result of which enquiry will be the accurate determination of Brahman's\nnature.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'Enquiry.'\n\nWhat then is that Brahman which is here said to be an object that should be\nenquired into?--To this question the second Sutra gives a reply.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[148:1](sbe48034.htm#fr_26) This view is held by the Prabhakara Mima _m_\nsakas.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
