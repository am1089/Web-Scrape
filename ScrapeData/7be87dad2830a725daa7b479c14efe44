And on account of the agreement of the attributes (mentioned in the text).\n\nThe attributes, moreover, which the sacred text ascribes to the bhuman agree\nwell with the highest Self. The passage, 'Where one sees nothing else, hears\nnothing else, understands nothing else, that is the bhuman,' gives us to\nunderstand that in the bhuman the ordinary activities of seeing and so on are\nabsent; and that this is characteristic of the highest Self, we know from\nanother scriptural passage, viz. 'But when the Self only is all this, how\nshould he see another?' &c. (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15). What is said about the\nabsence of the activities of seeing and so on in the state of deep sleep (Pra.\nUp. IV, 2) is said with the intention of declaring the non-attachedness of the\nSelf, not of describing the nature of the pra _n_ a; for the highest Self (not\nthe vital air) is the topic of that passage. The bliss also of which Scripture\nspeaks as connected with that state is mentioned only in order to show that\nbliss constitutes the nature of the Self. For Scripture says (B _ri_. Up. IV,\n3, 32), 'This is his highest bliss. All other creatures live on a small\nportion of that bliss.'--The passage under discussion also ('The bhuman is\nbliss. There is no bliss in that which is little (limited). The bhuman only is\nbliss') by denying the reality of bliss on the part of whatever is perishable\nshows that Brahman only is bliss as bhuman, i.e. in its plenitude,--Again, the\npassage, 'The bhuman is immortality,' shows that the highest cause is meant;\nfor the immortality of all effected things is a merely relative one,\n\np. 169\n\nand another scriptural passage says that 'whatever is different from that\n(Brahman) is perishable' (B _ri_. Up. III, 4, 2).--Similarly, the qualities of\nbeing the True, and of resting in its own greatness, and of being omnipresent,\nand of being the Self of everything which the text mentions (as belonging to\nthe bhuman) can belong to the highest Self only, not to anything else.--By all\nthis it is proved that the bhuman is the highest Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 10](sbe34079.htm)\n\n"
