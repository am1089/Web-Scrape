 \n\np. 227  \n\nYet I, O lady, also know  \nDue reverence to my lord to show.  \nWere he the meanest of the base,  \nUnhonoured with a single grace,  \nMy husband still I ne'er would leave,  \nBut firm through all to him would cleave:  \nStill rather to a lord like mine  \nWhose virtues high-exalted shine,  \nCompassionate, of lofty soul,  \nVith every sense in due control,  \nTrue in his love, of righteous mind,  \nLike a dear sire and mother kind.  \nE'en as he ever loves to treat  \nKaus'alya with observance meet,  \nHas his behaviour ever been  \nTo every other honoured queen.  \nNay, more, a sonlike reverence shows  \nThe noble Rama e'en to those  \nOn whom the king his father set  \nHis eyes one moment, to forget.  \nDeep in my heart the words are stored,  \nSaid by the mother of my lord,  \nWhen from my home I turned away  \nIn the lone fearful woods to stray.  \nThe counsel of my mother deep  \nImpressed upon my soul I keep,  \nWhen by the fire I took my stand,  \nAnd Rama clasped in his my hand.  \nAnd in my bosom cherished yet,  \nMy friends' advice I ne'er forget:  \nWoman her holiest offering pays  \nWhen she her husband's will obeys.  \nGood Savitri her lord obeyed,  \nAnd a high saint in heaven was made,  \nAnd for the self-same virtue thou  \nHast heaven in thy possession now.  \nAnd she with whom no dame could vie,  \nNow a bright Goddess in the sky,  \nSweet Rohini the Moon's dear Queen,  \nWithout her lord is never seen:  \nAnd many a faithful wife beside  \nFor her pure love is glorified.'  \n   Thus Sita spake: soft rapture stole  \nThrough Anasuya's saintly soul:  \nKisses on Sita's head she pressed,  \nAnd thus the Maithil dame addressed:  \n'I by long rites and toils endured  \nRich store of merit have secured:  \nFrom this my wealth will I bestow  \nA blessing ere I let thee go.  \nSo right and wise and true each word  \nThat from thy lips mine ears have heard,  \nI love thee: be my pleasing task  \nTo grant the boon that thou shalt ask.'  \n   Then Sita marvelled much, and while  \nPlayed o'er her lips a gentle smile,  \n'All has been done, O Saint, she cried,  \nAnd naught remains to wish beside.  \n   She spake; the lady's meek reply  \nSwelled Anasuya's rapture high.  \n'Sita,' she said,' my gift to-day  \nThy sweet contentment shall repay.  \nAccept this precious robe to wear,  \nOf heavenly fabric, rich and rare,  \nThese gems thy limbs to ornament,  \nThis precious balsam sweet of scent.  \nO Maithil dame, this gift of mine  \nShall make thy limbs with beauty shine,  \nAnd breathing o'er thy frame dispense  \nIts pure and lasting influence.  \nThis balsam on thy fair limbs spread  \nNew radiance on thy lord shall shed,  \nAs Lakshmi's beauty lends a grace  \nTo Vishnu's own celestial face.'  \n   Then Sita took the gift the dame  \nBestowed on her in friendship's name,  \nThe balsam, gems, and robe divine,  \nAnd garlands wreathed of bloomy twine;  \nThen sat her down, with reverence meet,  \nAt saintly Anasuya's feet.  \nThe matron rich in rites and vows  \nTurned her to Rama's Maithil spouse,  \nAnd questioned thus in turn to hear  \nA pleasant tale to charm her ear:  \n'Sita, 'tis said that Raghu's son  \nThy hand, mid gathered suitors, won.  \nI fain would hear thee, lady, tell  \nThe story as it all befell:  \nDo thou repeat each thing that passed,  \nReviewing all from first to last.'  \n   Thus spake the dame to Sita: she  \nReplying to the devotee,  \n'Then, lady, thy attention lend,'  \nRehearsed the story to the end:  \n   King Janak, just and brave and strong.  \nWho loves the right and hates the wrong.  \nWell skilled in what the law ordains  \nFor Warriors, o'er Videha reigns.  \nGuiding one morn the plough, his hand  \nMarked out, for rites the sacred land,  \nWhen, as the ploughshare cleft the earth,  \nChild of the king I leapt to birth.  \nThen as the ground he smoothed and cleared,  \nHe saw me all with dust besmeared,  \nAnd on the new-found babe, amazed  \nThe ruler of Videha gazed.  \nIn childless love the monarch pressed  \nThe welcome infant to his breast:  \n'My daughter,' thus he cried, 'is she:'  \nAnd as his child he cared for me.  \nForth from the sky was heard o'erhead  \nAs 'twere a human voice that said:  \n'Yea, even so: great King, this child  \nHenceforth thine own be justly styled.'  \nVideha's monarch, virtuous souled,  \nRejoiced o'er me with joy untold,  \nDelighting in his new-won prize,  \nThe darling of his heart and eyes.  \nTo his chief queen of saintly mind  \nThe precious treasure he consigned,  \nAnd by her side she saw me grow,  \nNursed with the love which mothers know.'  \n\np. 228  \n\nThen as he saw the seasons fly,  \nAnd knew my marriage-time was nigh,  \nMy sire was vexed with care, as sad  \nAs one who mourns the wealth he had:  \n'Scorn on the maiden's sire must wait  \nFrom men of high and low estate:  \nThe virgin's father all despise,  \nThough Indra's peer, who rules the skies.'  \nMore near he saw, and still more near,  \nThe scorn that filled his soul with fear,  \nOn trouble's billowy ocean tossed,  \nLike one whose shattered bark is lost.  \nMy father knowing how I came,  \nNo daughter of a mortal dame.  \nIn all the regions failed to see  \nA bridegroom meet to match with me.  \nEach way with anxious thought he scanned,  \nAnd thus at length the monarch planned:  \n'The Bride's Election will I hold,  \nWith every rite prescribed of old.'  \nIt pleased King Varun to bestow  \nQuiver and shafts and heavenly bow  \nUpon my father's sire who reigned,  \nWhen Daksha his great rite ordained.  \nWhere was the man might bend or lift  \nWith utmost toil that wondrous gift?  \nNot e'en in dreams could mortal king  \nStrain the great bow or draw the string.  \nOf this tremendous bow possessed,  \nMy truthful father thus addressed  \nThe lords of many a region, all  \nAssembled at the monarch's call:  \n'Whoe'er this bow can manage, he  \nThe husband of my child shall be.'  \nThe suitors viewed with hopeless eyes  \nThat wondrous bow of mountain size,  \nThen to my sire they bade adieu,  \nAnd all with humbled hearts withdrew.  \nAt length with Vis'vamitra came  \nThis son of Raghu, dear to fame,  \nThe royal sacrifice to view.  \nNear to my father's home he drew,  \nHis brother Lakshman by his side,  \nRama, in deeds heroic tried.  \nMy sire with honour entertained  \nThe saint in lore of duty trained,  \nWho thus in turn addressed the king:  \n'Rama and Lakshman here who spring  \nFrom royal Das'aratha, long  \nTo see thy bow so passing strong.'  \n\nBefore the prince's eyes was laid  \nThat marvel, as the Brahman prayed.  \nOne moment on the bow he gazed,  \nQuick to the notch the string he raised,  \nThen, in the wandering people's view,  \nThe cord with mighty force he drew.  \nThen with an awful crash as loud  \nAs thunderbolts that cleave the cloud,  \nThe bow beneath the matchless strain  \nOf arms heroic snapped in twain.  \nThus, giving purest water, he,  \nMy sire, to Rama offered me.  \nThe prince the offered gift declined  \nTill he should learn his father's mind;  \nSo horsemen swift Ayodhya sought  \nAnd back her aged monarch brought.  \nMe then my sire to Rama gave,  \nSelf-ruled, the bravest of the brave.  \nAnd Urmila, the next to me,  \nGraced with all gifts, most fair to see,  \nMy sire with Raghu's house allied.  \nAnd gave her to be Lakshman's bride.  \nThus from the princes of the land  \nLord Rama won my maiden hand,  \nAnd him exalted high above  \nHeroic chiefs I truly love.  \n\n        * * * * *'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto CXIX.: The Forest.](ry197.htm)\n\n"
