Following the rays.\n\nScripture teaches that the soul of him who knows, after having passed forth\nfrom the heart by way of the hundred and first artery, follows the rays of the\nsun and thus reaches the disc of the sun: 'when he departs from this body he\ngoes upwards by these rays only' (eva) ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 6, 5). The idea here\nsuggests itself that the going of the soul cannot be exclusively bound' to\nthose rays, since when a man dies during the night it _cannot_ follow tae rays\nof the sun. Hence the text quoted above can refer only to a part of the actual\ncases.--This view the Sutra rejects. The soul moves upwards, following the\nrays only; the text expressly asserting this by means of the 'eva'--which\nwould be out of place were there any alternative. Nor is there any strength in\nthe argument that the soul of him who dies at night cannot follow the rays as\nthere are none. For in summer the experience of heat at night-time shows\n\np. 740\n\nthat there are present rays then also; while in winter, as generally in bad\nweather, that heat is overpowered by cold and hence is not perceived (although\nactually present). Scripture moreover states that the arteries and rays are at\nall times mutually connected: 'As a very long highway goes to two villages, so\nthe rays of the sun go to both worlds, to this one and to the other. They\nstretch themselves forth from the sun and enter into these arteries'; they\nstretch themselves forth from these arteries and enter into yonder sun' (\n_Kh_. Up. VIII, 6, 2).--As thus there are rays at night also, the souls of\nthose who know reach Brahman by way of the rays only.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'the following up the rays.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 18. ... the connexion persists as long as the body does](sbe48534.htm)\n\n"
