Because that quality, viz. the quality of\nknowledge, is the essential quality, therefore the Self is, in the passages\nquoted, designated as knowledge. For knowledge constitutes the essential\nquality of the Self. Similarly, the intelligent highest Self is occasionally\ncalled 'Bliss,' because bliss is its essential quality. Compare 'If that bliss\nexisted not in the ether' (Taitt. Up. II, 7, 1); 'He perceived that bliss is\nBrahman' (Taitt. Up. III, 6, 1). That bliss is the essential attribute of\nBrahman is proved by texts such as 'That is one bliss of Brahman'; 'He who\nknows the bliss of Brahman is afraid of nothing' (Taitt. Up. II, 4, 1).--Or\nelse the analogous case to which the Sutra refers may be that of the\nintelligent Brahman being designated by the term 'knowledge,' in texts such as\n'Truth, knowledge, the Infinite is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1). That knowledge\nis the essential quality of Brahman is known from passages such as 'together\nwith the intelligent Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); 'He who is all-knowing'\n(Mu. Up. I, 1, 9).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 30. And there is no objection, since the quality of knowledge exists\nwherever the Self is...](sbe48276.htm)\n\n"
