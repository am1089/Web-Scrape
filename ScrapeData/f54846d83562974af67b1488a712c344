FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n10:1:1:11\\. In the first place that Agni (the Fire-altar), the year, is built\n1; thereafter the Great Litany (mahad uktham) is recited 2. When Pra _g_ apati\nbecame relaxed, the vital fluid flowed upwards 3.\n\n10:1:1:22\\. Now, that Pra _g_ apati who became relaxed is the year; and those\njoints of his which became relaxed are the days and nights.\n\n10:1:1:33\\. And that Pra _g_ apati who became relaxed is this very Fire-altar\nwhich here is built; and those joints of his, the days and nights, which\nbecame relaxed are no other than the bricks;--thus, when he lays down these\n(in the layers of the altar), he thereby restores to him those joints of his,\nthe days and nights, which had become relaxed: and thus\n\np. 282\n\nit is even in this (building of the altar) that this Ya _g_ us is built up 1\nand secured (for Pra _g_ apati).\n\n10:1:1:44\\. And that vital fluid (essence) of his which flowed upwards\n(became) the Great Litany: it is in quest of that vital fluid that (the\npriests) go by means of the _Ri_ _k_ and Saman. And when the Ya _g_ us marches\nin front in this (quest) 2, it is in order to fetch something that that (Veda)\ngoes--even as (one might say), 'That one thing there is mine, I will fetch\nit,' so does that Ya _g_ us go in front (or forward). That (vital fluid) they\nobtain in the course of a year 3.\n\n10:1:1:55\\. The Adhvaryu takes (draws) it by means of the Graha (Soma-cup);\nand inasmuch as he thereby takes (grab) it, it is (called) Graha 4. The Udgat\n_ri_ puts the vital fluid into it by means of the (saman of the) Great Rite\n(mahavrata 5); but, indeed, the\n\np. 283\n\n[paragraph continues] (saman of the) Great Rite is (equivalent to) all these\n(other) samans (hymn-tunes): it is thus by means of all the hymn-tunes that he\nputs the vital fluid therein. The Hot _ri_ puts the vital fluid therein by\nmeans of the Great Litany; but, indeed, the Great Litany is the same as all\nthese ri _k_ (hymn-verses) 1: it is thus by means of all the hymn-verses that\nhe puts the vital fluid into it (the Soma-cup).\n\np. 284\n\n10:1:1:66\\. When those (Udgat _ri_ s) chant (the stotra), and when he (the Hot\n_ri_ ) recites (the _s_ astra) afterwards, then he (the Adhvaryu) offers that\n(vital fluid, in the form of Soma) unto him (Agni-Pra _g_ apati) at the Vasha\n_t_ -call; and thus this vital fluid enters him. For, indeed, they do not see\nit to be the Great Rite that lies there being praised, nor the Great Litany,\nbut it is Agni alone they see; for Agni is the self (body), and thus those\ntwo, the _Ri_ _k_ and the Saman, enter him in the form of the vital fluid; and\nthus they both enter (join) the Ya _g_ us.\n\n10:1:1:77\\. Now, that Agni (fire-altar) consists of pairs--the first layer and\nthe second, and the third and fourth; and of the fifth layer the fire which is\nplaced on the built (altar) is the mate. And, indeed, this body consists of\npairs.\n\n10:1:1:88\\. The thumbs (and great toes, 'a\xe1\xb9\x85gush _th_ a,' m.) are males, and\nthe fingers and toes ('a\xe1\xb9\x85guli,' f.) females; the ears ('kar _n_ a' m.) are\nmales, and the eyebrows ('bhru,' f.) females; the lips ('osh _th_ a,' m.) are\nmales, and the nostrils ('nasika,' f.) females; the teeth ('danta,' m.) are\nmales, and the tongue (' _g_ ihva,' f.) is a female: indeed the whole (body)\nconsists of pairs, and with this body, consisting of pairs, that (vital fluid)\nenters this Agni (the fire-altar), consisting of pairs 1.\n\n10:1:1:99\\. This, then, is the entering therein;--even thus, indeed, he (Agni)\nconsists of pairs 2; but in this\n\np. 285\n\nway also he consists of pairs:--the fire-altar here built up is no other than\nthis speech, for with speech it is built up; and the fire which is placed on\nthe built (altar) is the breath; and the breath ('pra _n_ a,' m.) is the male,\nthe mate, of speech ('va _k_ ,' f.). And, indeed, this body is speech; and the\nbreath which is in the body is its mate: with this mated body that (vital\nfluid) thus enters into the mated Agni.\n\n10:1:1:1010\\. This also is the entering therein;--there is indeed no fear of\nhim (Agni) being without offspring to whosoever thus knows these two, the body\nand Agni, to be a pair; but, indeed, this body is food, as is said by the _Ri_\nshi ( _Ri_ g-veda X, 107, 7), 'The Dakshi _n_ a winneth food which is our own\nself (breath).'\n\n10:1:1:1111\\. Now, this food, when eaten, becomes of two kinds,--that part of\nit which is immortal (remains) above the navel: by the upward vital airs it\nmoves upwards and enters the air; but that part of it which is mortal tends to\nmove away: it passes beyond the navel, and, having become twofold, enters this\n(earth), as urine and faeces. Now that which enters this (earth) enters the\nfire-altar [1](sbe4346.htm#fn_529) built here; and that which enters the air\nenters that fire which is placed on the built (altar). This also is the\nentering therein.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[281:1](sbe4345.htm#fr_526) Or, possibly, 'that Agni is built in a year,' as\nparagraph [4](sbe4345.htm#10:1:1:4) might seem to suggest. Saya _n_ a,\nhowever, takes it in the above sense,--esho\xe0\xa4\xbdgni _h_ Sa _m_ vatsaratmaka _h_\npurastat purva _m_ _k_ iyate. The Agni _k_ ayana, when properly performed,\nrequires a full year, whence Agni-Pra _g_ apati is constantly identified with\nthe year and the seasons.\n\n[281:2](sbe4345.htm#fr_527) According to Saya _n_ a, the intermediate\nMahavrata-saman (see note 1, p. 283), chanted prior to the recitation of the\nMahad uktham, is likewise implied here.\n\n[281:3](sbe4345.htm#fr_528) Thus--urdhvalokam aga _k_ _kh_ at--Saya _n_ a\ntakes 'agram.'\n\n[282:1](sbe4345.htm#fr_529) Viz. inasmuch as ya _g_ us-formulas have to be\nused with the laying down of many of the bricks (the so-called 'ya _g_\nushmatis'). Whilst, in the case of the _Ri_ _k_ and Saman, other rites are\nnecessary to secure them for the restored Pra _g_ apati, the Ya _g_ us is\nsecured for him in the very act of building up his body, the fire-altar.\n\n[282:2](sbe4345.htm#fr_530) The Adhvaryu priest has to do all the practical\nwork connected with the sacrificial performance, the building of the altar,\n&c.; and inasmuch as it is with ya _g_ us-formulas he does so throughout, the\nYa _g_ us is said here to take the lead; cf. [X, 3, 5,\n3](sbe4360.htm#10:3:5:3).\n\n[282:3](sbe4345.htm#fr_531) Viz. by means of the sacrificial session of\nsacrificing, chanting, and reciting, called 'Gavam ayanam' (procession of the\ncows), lasting for one year, on the last day but one of which the Mahavrata,\nor Great Rite, is performed.\n\n[282:4](sbe4345.htm#fr_532) The particular cup of Soma here referred to is the\nMahavratiya-graha, the special cup of the Great Rite; cf. [X, 4, 1,\n12](sbe4361.htm#10:4:1:12) seq.\n\n[282:5](sbe4345.htm#fr_533) The central feature of the Mahavrata consists in\nthe chanting, at the mid-day service--as the Hot _ri_ 's P _ri_ sh _th_\na-stotra--of the so-called Mahavrata-saman. It consists of five different\nparts which,--like those of which the Mahad uktham, recited after it, is p.\n283 composed,--are considered as representing different parts of Agni-Pra _g_\napati's body, viz.: I. Gayatra-saman, representing the head; it is chanted in\nthe triv _ri_ t-stoma (nine-versed hymn-form) and consists of the triplets,\nSama-v. II, 146-8 (= _Ri_ g-veda I, 7, 1-3: indram id gathino b _ri_ hat), II,\n263-5 (indro dadhiko asthabhir), and II, 800-2 (ud ghed abhi _s_ rutamagham);\nthough, according to others, the Sama-triplets corresponding to _Ri_ g-veda I,\n7, I-9 may be chanted instead. 2. Rathantara-saman (Sama-v. II, 30-I),\nrepresenting the right wing, chanted in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a-stoma, or\nfifteen-versed form. 3. B _ri_ hat-saman (II, 159-60), the left wing, in the\nSaptada _s_ a-stoma, or seventeen-versed form. 4. Bhadra-saman (on II, 460-2;\nOf. Calc. ed., vol. v, p. 402), the tail, in the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a, or twenty-\none-versed form. 5. Ra _g_ ana- saman (on II, 833-5; cf. Calc. ed., vol. v, p.\n449), the body (atman), in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avi _m_ _s_ a-stoma, or twenty-five-\nversed form; instead of this the Vamadevya-saman (on II, 32-4) may be chanted\nin the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ anidhana form (Calc. ed., vol. v, p. 45I).--The chanting of\nthis Stotra is preceded by the singing of thirteen samans, called parimada _h_\n(see [X, 1, 2, 8](sbe4346.htm#10:1:2:8)), followed by certain ceremonies--\nbuckling armour on a nobleman, driving in a sunwise direction round the\nsacrificial ground, shooting arrows at two ox-hides, beating of drums, &c.--\napparently symbolising the driving off of evil spirits from the sacrifice, or\na combat for the possession of (the light of) the sun. The chanting itself is,\naccording to some authorities, performed by the Udgat _ri_ s, whilst,\naccording to others, all the priests (except the Hot _ri_ , for whom the\nMaitravaru _n_ a acts), as well as the G _ri_ hapati, or Sacrificer, take part\nin turn in the singing of the samans; the Prastot _ri_ and Pratihart _ri_ ;\nassistants of the Udgat _ri_ ; joining in with the successive performers in\nthe Nidhanas, or finales.\n\n[283:1](sbe4345.htm#fr_534) See [p. 110](sbe4324.htm#page_110), note\n[3](sbe4324.htm#fn_202); [p. 112](sbe4324.htm#page_112), note\n[1](sbe4324.htm#fn_204). During his recitation of the Great Litany, the Hot\n_ri_ is seated on a swing, the Adhvaryu p. 284 making his responses whilst\nstanding on a plank, and the Hot _ri_ 's assistants being seated on bundles of\ngrass.\n\n[284:1](sbe4345.htm#fr_535) Or, with this body as a mate it thus enters this\nAgni, its mate; literally, with this body forming one of a (productive) pair,\nit thus enters this Agni, forming one (i. e. the other) of a pair.\n\n[284:2](sbe4345.htm#fr_536) That is, he has in him the generative energy.\nApparently p. 285 'mithuna,' m. has also the sense of paired,' 'mated,' i.e.\n'one who has his complement or mate,' and so perhaps here.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 1, 2.
