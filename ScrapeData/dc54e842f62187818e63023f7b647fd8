In the whole range of literature few works are probably less\ncalculated to excite the interest of any outside the very limited number of\nspecialists, than the ancient theological writings of the Hindus, known by the\nname of Brahma _n_ as. For wearisome prolixity of exposition, characterised by\ndogmatic assertion and a flimsy symbolism rather than by serious reasoning,\nthese works are perhaps not equalled anywhere; unless, indeed, it be by the\nspeculative vapourings of the Gnostics, than which, in the opinion of the\nlearned translators of Irenaeus, 'nothing more absurd has probably ever been\nimagined by rational beings 1.' If I have, nevertheless, undertaken, at the\nrequest of the Editor of the present Series, what would seem to be a rather\nthankless task, the reason will be readily understood by those who have taken\neven the most cursory view of the history of the Hindu mind and institutions.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ as, it is well known, form our chief, if not our only, source\nof information regarding one of the most important periods in the social and\nmental development of India. They represent the intellectual activity of a\nsacerdotal caste which, by turning to account the religious instincts of a\ngifted and naturally devout race, had succeeded in transforming a primitive\nworship of the powers of nature into a highly artificial system of sacrificial\nceremonies, and was ever intent on deepening and extending its hold on the\nminds of the people, by surrounding its own vocation with the halo of sanctity\nand divine inspiration. A complicated ceremonial, requiring for its proper\nobservance and\n\np. x\n\nconsequent efficacy the ministrations of a highly trained priestly class, has\never been one of the most effective means of promoting hierarchical\naspirations. Even practical Rome did not entirely succeed in steering clear of\nthe rock of priestly ascendancy attained by such-like means. There, as\nelsewhere, 'the neglect or faulty performance of the worship of each god\nrevenged itself in the corresponding occurrence; and as it was a laborious and\ndifficult task to gain even a knowledge of one's religious obligations, the\npriests who were skilled in the law of divine things and pointed out its\nrequirements--the _pontifices_ \\--could not fail to attain an extraordinary\ninfluence 1.' The catalogue of the duties and privileges of the priest of\nJupiter might well find a place in the Talmud. 'The rule--that no religious\nservice can be acceptable to the gods, unless it be performed without a flaw--\nwas pushed to such an extent, that a single sacrifice had to be repeated\nthirty times in succession on account of mistakes again and again committed;\nand the games, which formed part of the divine service, were regarded as\nundone, if the presiding magistrate had committed any slip in word or deed, or\nif the music even had paused at a wrong time, and so had to be begun afresh,\nfrequently for several, even as many as seven, times in succession 2.' Great,\nhowever, as was the influence acquired by the priestly colleges of Rome, 'it\nwas never forgotten--least of all in the case of those who held the highest\nposition--that their duty was not to command, but to tender skilled advice 3.'\nThe Roman statesmen submitted to these transparent tricks rather from\nconsiderations of political expediency than from religious scruples; and the\nGreek Polybius might well say that the strange and ponderous ceremonial of\nRoman religion was invented solely on account of the multitude which, as\nreason had no power over it, required to be ruled by signs and wonders 4.'\n\nThe devout belief in the efficacy of invocation and sacrificial\n\np. xi\n\noffering which pervades most of the hymns of the Rig-veda, and which may be\nassumed to reflect pretty faithfully the religious sentiments of those amongst\nwhom they were composed, could not but ensure to the priest, endowed with the\ngift of sacred utterance, a considerable amount of respect and reverence on\nthe part of the people. His superior culture and habitual communion with the\ndivine rulers of the destinies of man would naturally entitle him to a place\nof honour by the side of the chiefs of clans, or the rulers of kingdoms, who\nwould not fail to avail themselves of his spiritual services, in order to\nsecure the favour of the gods for their warlike expeditions or political\nundertakings. Nor did the Vedic bard fail to urge his claims on the\nconsideration and generosity of those in the enjoyment of power and wealth. He\noften dwells on the supernatural virtues of his compositions and their\nmysterious efficacy in drawing down divine blessings on the pious worshipper.\nIn urging the necessity of frequent and liberal offerings to the gods, and\ninvoking worldly blessings on the offerer, the priestly bard may often be\ndetected pleading his own cause along with that of his employer, as Ka _n_ va\ndoes when he sings (Rig-veda VIII, 2, 13), 'Let him be rich, let him be\nforemost, the bard of the rich, of so illustrious a Maghavan 1 as thou, O lord\nof the bay steeds!' Though the Danastutis, or verses extolling, often in\nhighly exaggerated terms, the munificence of princely patrons, and generally\noccurring at the end of hymns, are doubtless, as a rule, later additions, they\nat least show that the sacerdotal office must have been, or must gradually\nhave become during this period, a very lucrative one.\n\nAlthough there is no reason to suppose that the sacrificial ceremonial was in\nearly times so fully developed as some scholars would have us believe, the\nreligious service would seem to have been already of a sufficiently advanced\nnature to require some kind of training for the priestly office. In course of\ntime, while the collection of hymns were faithfully\n\np. xii\n\nhanded down as precious heirlooms in the several families, and were gradually\nenriched by the poetical genius of succeeding generations, the ceremonial\nbecame more and more complicated, so as at last to necessitate the\ndistribution of the sacerdotal functions among several distinct classes of\npriests. Such a distribution of sacrificial duties must have taken place\nbefore the close of the period of the hymns, and there can be little doubt\nthat at that time the position of the priesthood in the community was that of\na regular profession, and even, to some extent, a hereditary one 1. A post of\npeculiar importance, which seems to go back to a very early time, was that of\nthe Purohita (literally 'praepositus'), or family priest to chiefs and kings.\nFrom the comparatively modest position of a private chaplain, who had to\nattend to the sacrificial obligations of his master, he appears to have\ngradually raised himself to the dignity of, so to say, a minister of public\nworship and confidential adviser of the king. It is obvious that such a post\nwas singularly favourable to the designs of a crafty and ambitious priest, and\nmust have offered him exceptional opportunities for promoting the hierarchical\naspirations of the priesthood 2.\n\nIn the Rig-veda there is, with the single exception of the Purusha-sukta, no\nclear indication of the existence of caste in the proper, Brahmanical sense of\nthe word. That institution, we may assume, was only introduced after the\nBrahmans had finally established their claims to the highest\n\np. xiii\n\nrank in the body politic; when they sought to perpetuate their social\nascendancy by strictly defining the privileges and duties of the several\nclasses, and assigning to them their respective places in the gradated scale\nof the Brahmanical community. The period during which the main body of the\nVedic hymns was composed, in the land of the seven rivers, seems to have been\nfollowed by a time of wars and conquests. From the literary products of the\nsucceeding period we can see that the centre of the \xc3\x82ryan civilisation had in\nthe meantime shifted from the region of the Sindhu (Indus) to that of the\nYamuna (Jumna) and Ga\xe1\xb9\x85ga. As the conquered districts were no doubt mainly\noccupied by aboriginal tribes, which had either to retire before their \xc3\x82ryan\nconquerors, or else to submit to them as _S_ udras, or serfs, it seems not\nunnatural to suppose that it was from a sense of the danger with which the\npurity of the Brahmanical faith was threatened from the idolatrous practices\nof the aboriginal subjects, that the necessity of raising an insurmountable\nbarrier between the \xc3\x82ryan freeman and the man of the servile class first\nsuggested itself to the Brahmans. As religious interests would be largely\ninvolved in this kind of class legislation, it would naturally call into play\nthe ingenuity of the priestly order; and would create among them that tendency\ntowards regulating the mutual relations of all classes of the community which\nultimately found its legal expression, towards the close of this period, in\nthe Dharma-sutras, the prototypes of the Hindu codes of law.\n\nThe struggle for social ascendancy between the priesthood and the ruling\nmilitary class must, in the nature of things, have been of long duration. In\nthe chief literary documents of this period which have come down to us, viz.\nthe Ya _g_ ur-veda, the Brahma _n_ as, and the hymns of the Atharva-veda some\nof which perhaps go back to the time of the later hymns of the _Ri_ k, we meet\nwith numerous passages in which the ambitious claims of the Brahmans are put\nforward with singular frankness. The powerful personal influence exercised by\nthe Purohitas, as has already been indicated, seems to have largely\ncontributed to the final success of the\n\np. xiv\n\nsacerdotal order. Thus we read in the Aitareya-brahma _n_ a VIII, 24-25,\n'Verily, the gods do not eat the food offered by the king who is without a\nPurohita: wherefore let the king, who wishes to sacrifice, place a Brahman at\nthe head (puro adhita). . . .' 'Now Agni Vai _s_ vanara, who is possessed of\nfive destructive weapons, is the same as the Purohita. With them he constantly\nsurrounds (protects) the king, even as the ocean surrounds the earth: the\nkingdom of such a ruler is undisturbed. His vital breath deserts him not\nbefore the (full term of) life, but he lives to old age, and attains to the\nfull measure of life: he dies not (and is not born) again, whosoever possesses\nsuch a wise Brahman for his Purohita, for the guardian of his realm.' And\nagain, in the Atharva-veda III, 19, 'May this prayer of mine be accomplished;\nmay perfect vigour and strength, may perfect, unceasing, and victorious power\naccrue to those whose Purohita I am. I perfect their kingdom, their might,\ntheir vigour, their strength. With this oblation I cut off the arms of their\nenemies . . . . Go forth, ye men, and conquer; may your arms be terrible! ye\nsharp-shafted, smite the weak-bowed; ye of terrible weapons and terrible arms,\n(smite) the feeble! when discharged, fly forth, O arrow, sped by prayer;\nvanquish the enemies; rush forward and slay all the best of them; let not one\nof them escape 1.'\n\nThe question as to how the Brahmans ultimately succeeded in overcoming the\nresistance of the ruling class receives but little light from the\ncontemporaneous records. Later legendary accounts of sanguinary struggles\nbetween the two classes, and the final overthrow, and even annihilation, of\nthe Kshatriyas can hardly deserve much credence. At best they seem to contain\nsome small kernel of historical fact. Perseverance and tenacity of purpose\nwere probably the chief means by which the Brahmans gained their ends. Not\nunfrequently, too, kings may have lent their countenance to the aspirations of\nthe priesthood, as calculated to counteract the unruly spirit and ambitious\ndesigns of the military order. We certainly meet with not a few instances of\nkings\n\np. xv\n\nfiguring as the patrons of learned Brahmans. As the old hymns were gradually\nassuming the character of divinely inspired utterances, additional matter\nmight occasionally find its way into them, almost unconsciously, which more\nadequately expressed the actual scope of the aspirations of their priestly\ndepositaries. That many such additions must have been made to the old hymns,\nprior to the age of diaskeuasts and exegetes, cannot be doubted.\n\nAnother, even more important, source of strength to the sacerdotal order was\nthe sacrifice. The more complicated the ceremonial, the greater the dependence\nof the lay worshipper on the professional skill of the priests; and the\ngreater the number of priests required for the proper performance of these\nceremonies, the larger the gains derived by the priesthood generally from this\nkind of occupation. What more natural, therefore, than that the highest\nimportance should have been ascribed to these performances, and an ever-\nincreasing attention bestowed on the elaboration of the ceremonial. From clear\nindications in not a few hymns of the Rig-veda it appears, as has already been\nremarked, that a distribution of the sacrificial functions among different\nclasses of priests had taken place before the final redaction of that\ncollection. As to the time when such a step may have become necessary for the\ndue performance of sacrifices, this is a question which will probably never be\ndecided. The sacrifice is an old Indo-Iranian, if not Indo-Germanic,\ninstitution. Some of the chief Indian sacrifices undoubtedly go back, in some\nform or other, to the common Indo-Iranian period, notably the Soma-sacrifice,\nand, if we may judge from the coincidence of name between the apri-hymns 1 and\nthe afri-gan of the Parsi ritual, the animal sacrifice.\n\nAs regards the third great division of Indian sacrifices, the havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nas (or offerings of milk, butter, grain-food, and similar materials), of which\nthe present volume treats, we have hardly any evidence to fall back upon. It\nis,\n\np. xvi\n\nhowever, highly probable that these sacrifices also reach at all events far\nback into the Vedic antiquity. Perhaps the careful preservation of the\npravara-lists 1, or lists of ancestors required at the ish _t_ i, the normal\nform of offering which underlies the havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, might be adduced in\nfavour of the antiquity of the latter. This, however, is a point which\nrequires further investigation. Neither has the last word been spoken\nregarding the traditional arrangements of the hymns. It is well known that the\nmajority of the single collections of which the first seven Ma _n_ _d_ alas\n(and to some extent those of the tenth) are made up, begin with hymns\naddressed to Agni, which, as a rule, are followed by hymns addressed to Indra.\nThese, again, are in many cases followed by hymns to the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_\n(and Maruts) 2. Now, in the later dogmatic literature we find the three \xc3\x82ryan\ncastes, the Brahman, the Kshatra, and the Vi _s_ , identified with Agni,\nIndra, and the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ (all the gods, or, as a special class, the\nAll-Gods) 3 respectively. This identification is a very natural one. Agni, the\nsacrificial fire, the bearer of oblations and caller of the gods, is, like the\npriest, the legitimate mediator between God and man. Penetrating brilliance\n(te _g_ as) and holy lustre (var _k_ as) are the common attributes of the\nBrahman. Again, Indra, the valiant hero, for ever battling with the dark\npowers of the sky, is a not less appropriate representative of the knightly\norder. According to Professor Roth, this truly national deity of the Vedic\n\xc3\x82ryans would seem to have superseded\n\np. xvii\n\nthe older Indo-Iranian god Trita 1, and to have gradually encroached on the\nprovince of Varu _n_ a, who perhaps was originally one of the highest deities\nof the \xc3\x82ryan (Indo-Germanic) pantheon. The warlike chiefs and clansmen\nevidently saw in Indra a more congenial object of their adoration. It can\nscarcely be without significance that of all the Vedic _Ri_ shis, Vasish _th_\na, the priest _par excellence_ , has ascribed to him by far the greatest\nnumber of hymns addressed to Varu _n_ a (and Mitra-Varu _n_ a), while there is\nnot a single hymn to Varu _n_ a in the family collection of the royal _Ri_ shi\nVi _s_ vamitra, whose religious enthusiasm is divided almost exclusively\nbetween Agni, Indra, and the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_. Lastly, the identification of\nthe common people with a whole class of comparatively inferior deities would\nnaturally suggest itself. Hence we also find the Maruts 2, the constant\ncompanions and helpmates of Indra, the divine ruler, employed in a similar\n\np. xviii\n\nsense. The identification of the Vi _s_ with the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ , which\nultimately obtained, was probably determined chiefly by etymological\nconsiderations.\n\nThe same triad of divinities, as representative of the mutual relations of the\nsocial grades of the \xc3\x82ryan community, is repeatedly met with in the\nsacrificial ritual, and especially in its dogmatic exposition. This\nidentification finds its most complete expression in the well-known passages\nof the Taittiriya-sa _m_ hita (VII, 1, 1, 4-5) and the Ta _n_ _d_ ya-brahma\n_n_ a (VI, 1, 6-11) 1. According to these authorities, Pra _g_ apati, the lord\nof creatures, created from his mouth the Brahma _n_ a, together with Agni, the\ntriv _ri_ t stoma, the gayatri metre (and the rathantara saman and he-goat,\naccording to the first source; or the spring, according to the other). From\nhis breast and arms he created the Ra _g_ anya, together with Indra, the pa\n_\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a stoma, the trish _t_ ubh metre (and the b _ri_ hat saman,\nand the ram; or the summer respectively). From the middle part of his body he\ncreated the Vai _s_ ya, together with the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ , the saptada _s_\na stoma, the _g_ agati metre (and the vairupa saman, and the kine; or the\nrainy season respectively). Finally, from his feet he created the Sudra,\ntogether with the ekavi _m_ _s_ a stoma and the anush _t_ ubh metre (and the\nvaira _g_ a saman and the horse, according to the Taitt. S.), but no deity,\nand no season. In accordance with these speculations, single objects of those\nhere enumerated are frequently found elsewhere identified with their\nrespective deities and castes. On the same principle, the three savanas, or\nmorning, mid-day, and evening libations 2 at the Soma-sacrifice, as well as\nthe first three days of the\n\np. xix\n\n[paragraph continues] Dvada _s_ aha 1, are generally assigned to Agni, Indra,\nand the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ respectively. If in the ekada _s_ ini, or\ntraditional order of eleven victims that have to be immolated at the Soma-\nsacrifice, the victim sacred to Agni is placed first, while those to the Vi\n_s_ ve Deva _h_ and to Indra only come sixth and seventh respectively, we have\nprobably to assume that this order was too firmly established (just as the so-\ncalled apri-hymns are) by long usage to have been easily altered; the more so\nas the privileged position of the sacerdotal class was not thereby affected.\n\nAt the havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as not less prominent a place is assigned to the divine\nrepresentatives of the two leading classes. The first oblation at every ish\n_t_ i belongs to Agni. The second oblation at the new-moon sacrifice is\noffered either to Indra, or to Indra 2 and Agni; at the full-moon sacrifice,\nto Agni and Soma, the latter of whom constitutes Indra's chief source of\nstrength. Indra also plays an important part at the Seasonal offerings which\nindeed, according to the dogmatic, and by no means improbable, explanation of\nthe Brahma _n_ as, are performed with special reference to Indra's struggle\nwith V _ri_ tra, the demon of drought. At the Agny-upasthana, or worship of\nthe fires, which succeeds the Agnihotra, the first prayer is addressed to\nAgni, the second to Indra and Agni 3. Indeed, while Agni appears everywhere as\nthe Purohita, the 'ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya deva _ri_ tvik,' or divine priest of the\nsacrifice, Indra is the god of sacrifice 4, the Maghavan, or munificent patron\nof the priest.\n\nFrom these indications it would appear far from improbable that the\narrangement of the hymns in which the collections of the Rig-veda were finally\nhanded down, was intended, as far as the leading deities are concerned, to\n\np. xx\n\nexhibit a social gradation of the Hindu community which was either already\nfirmly established or was steadily kept in view by the sacerdotal class as 'a\nconsummation devoutly to be wished.' In either case the claims of the priests\ncould not fail to be materially strengthened by the pre-eminent position\nassigned to their divine prototype in the inspired utterances of the [_Ri_\nshis](errata.htm#1). The question, whether the present arrangement is entirely\nthe result of the final redaction, or whether it was already a feature of the\nearlier redactions, will perhaps never receive a quite satisfactory answer. It\ncannot, however, be denied that there is some force in Professor Ludwig's 1\nargument,--that, if the arrangement of the several collections had lain with\nthe authors of the final redaction, the result would probably have been a far\ngreater uniformity than they now present.\n\nThe idea of bringing together the different family collections would seem\nfirst to have suggested itself to the priests at a time when the hitherto\ndivided \xc3\x82ryan tribes had moved from the Panjab to the eastern plains and\nbecame consolidated into larger communities, and the want of a more uniform\nsystem of worship would naturally make itself felt. To the same period, then,\nwe may refer the first attempts at a systematic arrangement of the entire\nceremonial of worship, and the definite distribution of the sacrificial duties\namong four classes of priests,--viz. the Adhvaryu, or performer of the\nmaterial part of the sacrifice; the Udgat _ri_ , or chanter of hymns; the Hot\n_ri_ , or reciter of solemn sacrificial prayers; and the Brahman, or\nsuperintendent of the entire performance. Though some of these offices had no\ndoubt existed for a long time, we possess no definite information as to the\nexact extent of the duties entrusted to them 2. The institution of the office\n\np. xxi\n\nof Brahman, doubtless the latest of all, marks a new era in the development of\nthe sacrificial system. While the other priests were only required to possess\nan accurate knowledge of their own special departments, the Brahman was to be\nthe very embodiment of the sacrificial art and Vedic lore in general, so as to\nbe able to advise the other priests on doubtful points and to rectify any\nmistakes that might be committed during the performance of sacrifices. Neither\nhad the Hot _ri_ priest any special manual of his formulas assigned to him. He\nwas rather expected to have acquired a thorough knowledge of the whole of the\n_Ri_ k-sa _m_ hita, from which the sacrificial prayers recited by him were\nexclusively selected. It was probably out of this class--or the Bahv _ri_ _k_\nas, as the followers of the Rig-veda came to be called--more than from any\nother, that individual priests would fit themselves for the office of Brahman.\n\nAs regards the two remaining classes of priests--the Udgat _ri_ s and\nAdhvaryus--we have no means of determining in what form and to what extent the\nstock of chants and sacrificial formulas used by them may have existed from\nthe time of the institution of their offices down to the formation of the\ncollections that have been handed down, viz. the Sama-veda-sa _m_ hita and the\nYa _g_ ur-veda. From the close connection that exists between the Saman and\nthe eighth and ninth ma _n_ _d_ alas of the _Ri_ k, as well as from the fact\nthat most of the hymns of these two ma _n_ _d_ alas are ascribed to authors\nwhose family collections (including, in several instances, hymns of their own)\nare contained in earlier ma _n_ _d_ alas,--we may perhaps assume that already\nat the time when the first nine ma _n_ _d_ alas were collected the then\nexisting hymns of the eighth and ninth ma _n_ _d_ alas were set apart for the\npurpose of being chanted at the Soma-sacrifice. In course of time--hand in\nhand with the fuller development of the Soma ritual and the gradual influx of\nnew hymn material which was either incorporated with the old collections or\nformed into a new ma _n_ _d_ ala--additional chants (or more suitable ones in\nthe place of those hitherto\n\np. xxii\n\nused) might be required and selected from the hymns of other ma _n_ _d_ alas.\nIn its original connected form, the material of these chants would naturally\nremain all along an essential part of the _Ri_ k-sa _m_ hita, for the use of\nthe Hot _ri_ and Brahman priests; and thus each of these two collections would\nhenceforth have a history of its own, and discrepancies in the texts common to\nboth would gradually become more and more numerous.\n\nThe sacrificial texts used by the Adhvaryu priest are contained in the Ya _g_\nur-veda, of which several recensions have come down to us. These texts\nconsist, in about equal parts, of verses ( _ri_ _k_ ) and prose formulas (ya\n_g_ us). The majority of the former are likewise found in the _Ri_ k-sa _m_\nhita, though not unfrequently with considerable variations, which may be\nexplained partly from a difference of recension, and partly as the result of\nthe adaptation of these verses to their special sacrificial purpose 1. With\nthe prose formulas, on the other hand, save a few isolated sacrificial calls\nalluded to in the _Ri_ k 2, we meet for the first time in this collection. In\nthe older recensions of the Ya _g_ ur-veda the texts are, as a rule, followed\nimmediately by their dogmatic explanation. Now, these theological treatises,\ncomposed chiefly with the view of elucidating the sacrificial texts and\nexplaining the origin and hidden meaning of the various rites, form one of the\nmost important departments of the literature of the period which succeeded the\nsystematic arrangement of the sacrificial ceremonial, and in which we must\nplace the gradual consolidation of the Brahmanical hierarchy. Such as they lie\nbefore us, they contain the accumulated wisdom and speculations of generations\nof Indian divines. They are essentially digests of a floating mass of single\ndiscourses or _dicta_ on various points of the ceremonial of worship, ascribed\nto individual teachers, and handed down orally in the theological schools.\nSingle discourses of this kind were called brahma _n_ a,--probably either\nbecause they were intended for the instruction and guidance of priests\n\np. xxiii\n\n[paragraph continues] (brahman) generally; or because they were, for the most\npart, the authoritative utterances of such as were thoroughly versed in Vedic\nand sacrificial lore and competent to act as Brahmans or superintending\npriests 1. In later times a collection or digest of such detached pieces came\nto be likewise called a Brahma _n_ a. Works of this kind have come down to us\nin connection with all the Vedic Sa _m_ hitas, generally in more than one\nversion which, though on the whole betraying a common stock of material, often\nvary considerably, both in their arrangement and their treatment of these\nmaterials. Nay, owing as they do their origin to different schools of the same\nVeda, these recensions not unfrequently take the very opposite view of single\npoints of ceremonial. Originally the number of such recensions, more or less\ndiffering from each other, must have been much larger; but the practical\ntendencies of a later age, which led to the production of concise manuals of\nceremonial rules--the Kalpa-sutras--adapted to the sacrificial practices of\nmore than one school, were not favourable to the perpetuation of these bulky\ncyclopaedias of theological school-wisdom: thus only the Brahma _n_ as of the\nschools which had the greatest number of followers survived; while others were\nprobably never committed to writing, or at best had a precarious existence\ndown to more recent times.\n\nWhile the Brahma _n_ as are thus our oldest sources from which a comprehensive\nview of the sacrificial ceremonial can be obtained, they also throw a great\ndeal of light on the earliest metaphysical and linguistic speculations of the\nHindus. Another, even more interesting feature of these works, consists in the\nnumerous legends scattered through them. From the archaic style in which these\nmythological tales are generally composed, as well as from the fact that not a\nfew of them are found in Brahma _n_ as of different schools and Vedas, though\noften with considerable variations,\n\np. xxiv\n\nit is pretty evident that the ground-work of many of them goes back to times\npreceding the composition of the Brahma _n_ as. From a mythological, and to\nsome extent from a linguistic, point of view these legends thus form a\nconnecting link between the latter and the Vedic hymns. In the case of some of\nthese legends--as those of _S_ una _h_ _s_ epha 1 and the fetching of the Soma\nfrom heaven 2\\--we can even see how they have grown out of germs contained in\nthe Vedic hymns; their relation to the latter being thus not unlike that of\nthe Sagas of the younger Edda to the songs of the older Edda. The Kaushitaki\nBrahma _n_ a 3, at the end of a story of this kind about Soma, remarks that it\nis thus told by those versed in legend (akhyanavida _h_ ). We may perhaps\ninfer from this passage that there was a class of people who took a special\ninterest in such legends, and made it their business to collect and repeat\nthem. Indeed, many of the elaborate mythical stories with which we meet in the\nlater epical and Pura _n_ ic literature doubtless owe their origin to simple\npopular legends of this kind 4.\n\nBesides the genuine myths which we find in the Brahma _n_ as, there is also a\nlarge number of stories which were evidently invented by the authors of these\ntreatises for the purpose of supplying some kind of traditional support for\nparticular points of ceremonial 5. However small the intrinsic merit of such\npassages, they, too, are not entirely devoid of interest, especially from a\nlinguistic point of view, since the style of narrative and the archaic mode of\ndiction which they affect, readily lend themselves to syntactic turns of\nexpression rarely indulged in by the authors in the purely explanatory and\nexegetic parts of their works. And, indeed, whatever opinion the general\nreader may form of the Brahma _n_ as, as purely literary corn-\n\np. xxv\n\npositions--and, assuredly, it cannot be a very high one--to the Sanskrit\nstudent these works (together with their supplements, the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas; and\ntheir metaphysical appendages, the Upanishads) are of the highest importance\nas the only genuine prose works which the Sanskrit, as a popular language, has\nproduced. For the comparative study of syntax, which has been taken up with\nsuch signal success by Professor Delbruck and other scholars, the Brahma _n_\nas offer a rich field of enquiry. Nor is the style of these compositions--with\nits compact grammatical forms and expressive particles, and its habitual\nemployment of the _oratio directa_ instead of dependent clauses--without a\ncertain rough beauty of its own, which, however, almost entirely evaporates in\na rendering into modern analytical speech. And notwithstanding the general\nemptiness of the speculations of the Indian theologians, 'there are,' as\nProfessor Max Muller observes 1, 'passages in the Brahma _n_ as full of\ngenuine thought and feeling, and most valuable as pictures of life, and as\nrecords of early struggles, which have left no trace in the literature of\nother nations.'\n\nAlthough the Adhvaryus, who had to perform all the manual work connected with\nthe sacrifice, were originally looked upon as a subordinate class of priests,\ntheir office seems to have risen in the general estimation with the increasing\nimportance that was attributed to the endless details of the ceremonial. In a\npassage of the Taittiriya Upanishad (2, 3). the Ya _g_ us is said to be the\nhead, the _Ri_ k the right side, the Saman the left side, the \xc3\x82de _s_ a 2 the\nsoul, and the Atharva\xe1\xb9\x85giras (Atharva-veda) the tail. With better reason the Ya\n_g_ ur-veda might be called the body of the sacrifice, since it contains\nalmost the entire apparatus of sacrificial formulas, while the other\nritualistic works are concerned, either chiefly or entirely, with the Soma-\nsacrifice. As a matter of fact, no other Veda has given rise to so large a\nnumber of schools as the\n\np. xxvi\n\n[paragraph continues] Ya _g_ ur-veda 1. The numerous subdivisions of the\nAdhvaryus trace their origin to either of two principal schools, an older and\na younger one, the latter of which is itself an offshoot of the former. The\noral transmission of the large body of exegetic and legendary matter attached\nto the sacrificial formulas could hardly fail, in course of time, to produce\nconsiderable variations, in different localities, both as regards the wording\nand the arrangement of these works. Different schools would naturally arise,--\neach with its own approved recension of the traditional texts,--which in their\nturn would sooner or later become liable to the same process of\ndisintegration. Such, indeed, has been the case, more or less, with all the\nVedic texts, until mechanical means were devised to arrest this process of\nchange. The names of many such subdivisions of the older Ya _g_ ur-veda are\nrecorded; but hitherto the recensions of only three of them have come to\nlight,--viz. the Ka _th_ aka, the Maitraya _n_ i-sa _m_ hita, and the\nTaittiriya-sa _m_ hita. The two former texts belong to subdivisions of the Ka\n_th_ as and Maitraya _n_ iyas, two branches of the old school of the _K_\narakas or _K_ arakadhvaryus. The Taittiriyas, on the other hand, seem to have\nbeen an independent branch of the old Ya _g_ us 2, the origin of which is\nascribed to a teacher named Tittiri. Their text has come down to us in the\nrecension of one of its subdivisions 3, the \xc3\x82pastambins.\n\nThe chief characteristic of the old Ya _g_ us texts consists, as has already\nbeen indicated, in the constant intermingling\n\np. xxvii\n\nof the sacrificial formulas and the explanatory or Brahma _n_ a portions. It\nwas with the view of remedying this want of arrangement, by entirely\nseparating the exegetic matter from the formulas, that the new school of\nAdhvaryus was founded. The name given to this school is Va _g_ asaneyins, its\norigin being ascribed to Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya Va _g_ asaneya. The result of this\nnew redaction of the Ya _g_ us texts was the formation of a Sa _m_ hita, or\ncollection of mantras, and a Brahma _n_ a. This re-arrangement was doubtless\nundertaken in imitation of the texts of the Hot _ri_ priests, who had a Brahma\n_n_ a 1 of their own, while their sacrificial prayers formed part of the _Ri_\nk-sa _m_ hita. Indeed, the Taittiriyas themselves became impressed with the\ndesirability of having a Brahma _n_ a of their own,--and attained their object\nby the simple, if rather awkward, expedient of applying that designation to an\nappendage to their Sa _m_ hita, which exhibits the same mixture of mantra and\nbrahma _n_ a as the older work. They also incorporated a portion of the Ka\n_th_ aka text into their Brahma _n_ a and its supplement, the Taittiriyara _n_\nyaka. Of all the schools of the old Ya _g_ us those of the Taittiriyas seem to\nhave attracted by far the greatest number of adherents; and in southern India\ntheir texts have continued pre-eminently the subject of study till the present\nday. In northern India, on the other hand, they have been largely superseded\nby their later rivals. On account of the lucid arrangement of their sacred\ntexts, the Va _g_ asaneyins called them the White ( _s_ ukla) Ya _g_ ur-veda;\nthe term of Black or Dark (k _ri_ sh _n_ a) Ya _g_ ur-veda being, for the\nopposite reason, applied to the texts of the older schools. In later times, an\nabsurd story was invented (doubtless by followers of the White Ya _g_ us), in\nwhich the origin of the name Taittiriya is connected with the word tittiri 2,\nin the sense of 'partridge.'\n\np. xxviii\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a of the Va _g_ asaneyins bears the name of _S_ atapatha, that\nis, the Brahma _n_ a 'of a hundred paths,' because it consists of a hundred\nlectures (adhyayas). Both the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita and the _S_ atapatha-\nbrahma _n_ a have come down to us in two different recensions, those of the\nMadhyandina and the Ka _n_ va schools. Of the latter recension of the Brahma\n_n_ a, however, three books out of seventeen are wanting in the European\nlibraries and have, as far as I know, not yet been discovered in India. The\nMadhyandina text both of the Sa _m_ hita and the Brahma _n_ a has been edited\nby Professor Weber; the former with the various readings of the Ka _n_ va\nrecension. To the same scholar we owe a German translation of the first\nadhyaya of the first ka _n_ _d_ a 1; and he has, moreover, subjected the\nentire accessible literature of the White Ya _g_ ur-veda--with the exception\nof the Ka _n_ va text of the Brahma _n_ a--to a careful examination, and has\nextracted from it all that seems calculated to throw light on its history, so\nthat in this respect little remains to those who come after him but to state\nthe results of his enquiries. Professor Max Muller, in his History of Ancient\nSanskrit Literature, has also fully discussed the questions regarding the date\nand authorship of these texts, and has done much to clear up what was obscure\nin their relations to the older Ya _g_ us texts and to Vedic literature\ngenerally. Many points, however, still remain doubtful; and, above all,\nopinions are as divided as ever regarding the approximate date of the teacher\nwith whose name tradition connects the origin of the modern school of the\nAdhvaryus.\n\nThe schools of the Va _g_ asaneyins are stated to have been either fifteen or\nseventeen; and their names are given, though with considerable variations, in\ndifferent works. No distinct traces, however, have as yet been discovered of\nany recensions besides the two already referred to. As regards the names of\nthese two,--the Madhyandina and Ka _n_ va,--the latter is the name of one of\nthe chief families of _Ri_ shis\n\np. xxix\n\nof the _Ri_ k-sa _m_ hita; and certain orthoepic peculiarities of the Ya _g_\nus texts of the Ka _n_ vas would seem to favour the assumption of a connection\nof this school with the redaction of the _Ri_ k. The name of the Madhyandinas,\nliterally 'meridional,' on the other hand, does not occur in the older\nliterature. Nor can we draw any definite conclusions, as to the probable date\nof their recension, from Lassen's identification of this name with the\n\xce\x9c\xce\xb1\xce\xbd\xce\xb4\xce\xb9\xce\xb1\xce\xb4\xce\xb9\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\xb7, mentioned by Megasthenes (as quoted by Arrian) as a people on the\nbanks of a tributary of the Ganges; or from Professor Weber's conjecture that\nthe Madhyandina school may have taken its origin among that people.\n\nThe Madhyandina text of the _S_ atapatha is divided into fourteen books (ka\n_n_ _d_ a). For several reasons, however, some of these books have to be\nassigned to a later period than the others. In the first place, the twelfth ka\n_n_ _d_ a is called madhyama, 'the middle one;' a fact which in itself would\nsuggest the idea that, at the time when this nomenclature was adopted, the\nlast five books (or perhaps books 11-13) were regarded as a separate portion\nof the work 1. Besides, Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali, in a karika or memorial couplet to\nPa _n_. IV, 2, 60, mentions the words shash _t_ ipatha ('consisting of sixty\npaths') and _s_ atapatha, with the view of forming derivative nouns from them,\nin the sense of one who studies such works. Now, as the first nine books of\nthe _S_ atapatha, in the Madhyandina text, consist of sixty adhyayas, it was\nsuggested by Professor Weber that it was probably this very portion of the\nwork to which Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali applied the term 'shash _t_ ipatha,' and that\nconsequently the first nine books were at that time considered as, in some\nsense, a distinct work and were studied as such. This conjecture has been\ngenerally accepted. There is indeed a possibility that Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali may\nhave been acquainted with some other\n\np. xxx\n\nrecension of the Brahma _n_ a of the Va _g_ asaneyins which consisted of only\nforty adhyayas; but even in that case the latter would in all probability\ncorrespond to the first nine books of the Madhyandina text. As regards the Ka\n_n_ va recension, we are unfortunately not yet able, owing to the want of some\nof its ka _n_ _d_ as, to determine its exact extent; and have to rely on a\nlist added by a scribe on the front' page of one of the ka _n_ _d_ as in the\nOxford MS. 1, according to which that text consists of 104 adhyayas. Still\nfurther evidence regarding the mutual relations of the several portions of our\nBrahma _n_ a is contained in a passage of the Mahabharata (XII, 11739), where\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya relates that, at the inspiration of the Sun, he composed (\n_k_ akre) the _S_ atapatha, including 2 the Rahasya (mystery), the Sa _m_\ngraha (epitome), and the Pari _s_ ish _t_ a (supplement). Now the tenth book\nis really called Agni-rahasya; while the eleventh contains a kind of summary\nof the preceding ritual; and ka _n_ _d_ as 12-14 treat of various other\nsubjects. This relation between the first nine and the remaining five books is\nalso fully borne out by internal evidence, as well as by a comparison with the\nVa _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita. The latter consists of forty adhyayas, the first\neighteen of which contain the formulas of the ordinary sacrifices--the Havirya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as and Soma-sacrifice--and correspond to the first nine books of the\n_S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a. The succeeding adhyayas have been clearly shown by\nProfessor Weber 3 to be later additions. As a rule only those formulas which\nare contained in the first eighteen adhyayas are found in the Taittiriya-sa\n_m_ hita; while those of the later adhyayas are given in the Taittiriya-brahma\n_n_ a.\n\nAt the end of the _S_ atapatha the White Ya _g_ us is said to have been\npromulgated (a-khya) by Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya Va _g_ asaneya. Now the name of\nthis teacher is indeed more frequently met with in the Brahma _n_ a than that\nof any other;\n\np. xxxi\n\nespecially in some of the later books where his professional connection with\n_G_ anaka, king of Videha, and his skill in theological disputations are\nfavourite topics. As regards the earlier portion of the work, however, it is a\nremarkable fact that, while in the first five books Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya's\nopinion is frequently recorded as authoritative 1, he is not once mentioned in\nthe four succeeding ka _n_ _d_ as (6-9). The teacher whose opinion is most\nfrequently referred to in these books, is _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya. This\ndisagreement in respect of doctrinal authorities, coupled with unmistakable\ndifferences 2, stylistic as well as geographical and mythological, can\nscarcely be accounted for otherwise than by the assumption of a difference of\nauthorship or original redaction. Now the subject with which these four ka _n_\n_d_ as are chiefly concerned, is the agni _k_ ayana, or construction of the\nsacred fire-altar. For reasons urged by Professor Weber, it would appear not\nimprobable that this part of the ceremonial was specially cultivated in the\nnorth-western districts; and since the geographical allusions in these four ka\n_n_ _d_ as chiefly point to that part of India, while those of the other books\nrefer almost exclusively to the regions along the Ganges and Jumna, we may\ninfer from this that the fire-ritual, adopted by the Va _g_ asaneyins at the\ntime of the first redaction of their texts--that is, of the first nine ka _n_\n_d_ as, as far as the Brahma _n_ a is concerned--had been settled in the\nnorth-west of India.\n\nHere, however, we meet with another difficulty. The tenth book, or\nAgnirahasya, deals with the same subject as the preceding four ka _n_ _d_ as;\nand here also _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya figures as the chief authority, while no\nmention is made of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya. Moreover, at the end of that ka _n_ _d_\na, a list of teachers is given in which the transmission of the sacrificial\nscience (either in its entirety, or only as regards the fire-ritual) is traced\nfrom a teacher Tura Kavasheya--who is said to have received it from the god\nPra _g_ apati--downwards, through two intermediate teachers, to _S_ a _n_ _d_\nilya;\n\np. xxxii\n\nand from thence, through six intermediate teachers, to _S_ a _m_ _g_ ivi-\nputra. Tura Kavasheya is referred to in another passage of the tenth ka _n_\n_d_ a (X, 6, 5, 9) as having built a fire-altar 1 to the gods at Karoti; and\nin the Aitareya-brahma _n_ a he is mentioned as the high-priest who officiated\nat the inauguration-ceremony of king _G_ aname _g_ aya Parikshita, renowned in\nepic legend. From these indications we may, it seems to me, take it for\ncertain that Tura Kavasheya and _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya (the latter of whom is also\nheld in high repute by the _Kh_ andogas or Saman-priests) were regarded by the\nVa _g_ asaneyins as the chief arrangers, if not the originators, of the fire-\nritual such as it was finally adopted by that school. On the other hand, we\nsaw that the first nine books of the _S_ atapatha, if their identification\nwith Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali's 'shash _t_ ipatha.' be correct, must have been\nregarded as, in some particular sense, a complete work. Now this combination\nof the fire-ritual in ka _n_ _d_ as 6-9 with the complete exposition of the\nHavirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a and Soma-sacrifice, contained in the first five books, would\nseem to presuppose some kind of compromise between the two schools recognising\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya and _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya respectively as their chief\nauthority. What, then, are we to understand to be the exact relations between\nthe later ka _n_ _d_ as, especially the tenth, and the earlier portion of the\nwork? We do not, and could not, meet with such a term as ' _k_ atvari _m_ _s_\nat-patha,' or work of forty paths, as applying to the last five ka _n_ _d_ as\nof the _S_ atapatha; their nature was too well understood for that, as we see\nfrom the passage of the Mahabharata, above referred to. The list of teachers\nat the end of the tenth ka _n_ _d_ a shows no sign of any amalgamation of the\ntwo schools up to the time of Sa _m_ _g_ ivi-putra, the last teacher mentioned\nin it: with one exception, it belongs exclusively to the _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya\nschool. It contains, however, an additional remark to the effect that from Sa\n_m_ _g_ ivi-putra downward the list is 'identical,'--viz. with some other\nlist. Now this remark can only refer to the [va _m_ _s_ a](errata.htm#3) given\nat the end of the last ka _n_ _d_ a. In this list the\n\np. xxxiii\n\ntransmission of the science of the Adhvaryus is traced--as far as human agency\nis concerned--from Ka _s_ yapa Naidhruvi, through nine teachers, to Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya, and thence, through four other teachers, to Sa _m_ _g_ ivi-putra 1.\nThe only name which this list has in common with the former one, previous to\nSa _m_ _g_ ivi-putra, is that of Ku _s_ ri. According to the former list, he\nwas the teacher of _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya, who, in his turn, taught Vatsya 2. But\nsince in the same book (X, 5, 5, 1) he is referred to as Va _g_ a _s_ ravasa,\nand in the list at the end of the _S_ atapatha he is set down as the pupil of\nVa _g_ a _s_ ravas, the same teacher is evidently referred to in both lists;\nand if we can at all rely on the authenticity of these va _m_ _s_ as, we\nshould have to infer from this coincidence, that there was already some\nconnection between the two schools prior to both Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya and _S_ a\n_n_ _d_ ilya.\n\nThe two lines of teachers meet once more in the name of Sa _m_ _g_ ivi-putra.\nIn the later list the succession of teachers\n\np. xxxiv\n\nis then continued by forty-nine more names--all of them formed by the addition\nof 'putra' (son) to the mother's name--which, it appears, we are to supply in\nthe former list. According to Professor Max Muller 1, 'Sa _m_ _g_ ivi-putra\nseems to have united two lines of teachers.' That this must have been the\ncase, cannot be doubted, provided, of course, that the va _m_ _s_ as are\ntrustworthy 2. Nay, I should even be inclined to assign to the time of Sa _m_\n_g_ ivi-putra the final adjustment of the ritual and its dogmatic exposition\nsuch as we find them in the Shash _t_ ipatha (and the first eighteen adhyayas\nof the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita), and consequently the first redaction of\nthat part of the _S_ atapatha. Not that all the matter contained in the latter\npart of the work must necessarily be more modern. There can, on the contrary,\nbe little doubt that much of it is quite as old as anything in the earlier\nbooks; and of the Madhuka _n_ _d_ a, which forms part of the B _ri_ had-ara\n_n_ yaka in the last book, we know at any rate, from a reference to the Madhu-\nbrahma _n_ a in the fourth ka _n_ _d_ a, that some such tract existed at that\ntime. But such matter as, for some reason or other, was not included in the\nsystematic exposition of the ceremonial, would naturally be in a less settled\ncondition and more liable to modifications and additions.\n\nAccording to the two lists, Sa _m_ _g_ ivi-putra is removed from _S_ a _n_ _d_\nilya by six intermediate teachers, the three older 3 of whom are referred to\nin ka _n_ _d_ as 6-9; and from Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\n\np. xxxv\n\nby four intermediate teachers, the first of whom (\xc3\x82suri) 1 is repeatedly\nquoted in the second (and once each in the first, fourth, and fourteenth) ka\n_n_ _d_ as. Although these indications do not, of course, supply more than a\n_terminus a quo_ for the final settlement of this part of the work, they would\nnevertheless seem to favour the supposition that the combination of the fire-\nritual with the sacrificial system cannot have taken place at a time far\nremoved from that of Sa _m_ _g_ ivi-putra. The custom of forming metronymics\nby means of 'putra' is of some interest. It first shows itself in the\npredecessor of Sa _m_ _g_ ivi-putra's teacher in the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya line,\nand continues from thence down to the very end of the va _m_ _s_ a.\nUnfortunately, however, we have no means of ascertaining whether this custom\nhad already been commonly practised, in certain localities, before that time,\nor whether, as seems to me more probable, it was a fashion of recent date. If\nthe latter alternative could be proved, it might help to settle the\nchronological relations between Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya and Pa _n_ ini, since it\nwould appear from Pa _n_. IV, 1, 159 2 (and VI, 1, 13), that the great\ngrammarian was well acquainted, not only with the practice of forming\nmetronymics of this kind, but also with that of forming patronymics from such\nmetronymics.\n\nThe relative date of Pa _n_ ini and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya has been discussed more\nthan once by Sanskrit scholars 3; but no agreement has as yet been come to on\nwhat Goldstucker justly called 'one of the most important problems of Sanskrit\nliterature.' The chief difficulty of this problem lies in the ambiguity of\nKatyayana's well-known varttika to Pa _n_. IV, 3, 105. According to Pa _n_\nini's rule the names\n\np. xxxvi\n\nof Brahma _n_ as and Kalpas proclaimed by old (sages) are formed by the\naddition of the affix in (to the sages' names). As instances of Brahma _n_ as,\nthe names of which are formed in this way, the Ka _s_ ika V _ri_ tti gives\nBhallavina _h_ (proclaimed by Bhallu), _S_ atyayanina _h_ , Aitareyi _n_ a\n_h_. In accordance with this rule the texts of the White Ya _g_ us are called\nVa _g_ asaneyina _h_. This name does not; however, occur in any of Pa _n_\nini's rules, but follows only from the word 'va _g_ asaneya' being included in\nthe ga _n_ a ' _s_ aunakadi' to Pa _n_. IV, 3, 106; and since we have no\nevidence as to whether any of the words in a ga _n_ a except the first really\nbelong to Pa _n_ ini, it must remain doubtful whether or not he knew of the\nexistence of the school known by that name. Katyayana's varttika runs thus:\nAmong the Brahma _n_ as and Kalpas proclaimed by the old, there is an\nexception in regard to Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya and others, on account of\ncontemporaneousness: hence (Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya's Brahma _n_ as are called, not\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkina _h_ , but) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkani Brahma _n_ ani; Saulabhani\nB.' The question, then, is, Does Katyayana mean to say that the Brahma _n_ as\nproclaimed by Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya do not fall under this rule, because he was\ncontemporary with Pa _n_ ini,--and therefore not an old sage in the sense of\nthe rule,--or, that those works should have been excepted by Pa _n_ ini from\nhis rule, because they are of the same age as those (old) Brahma _n_ as to\nwhich the rule applies? The former alternative was the one generally accepted,\nuntil the late Professor Goldstucker made known the text of Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali's\nand Kaiya _t_ a's comments 1 on this varttika. He showed that Kaiya _t_ a, at\nleast, clearly interprets it in the sense that Pa _n_ ini should have excepted\nworks like the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkani Brahma _n_ ani, since they, too (api), are\nof the same age as the _S_ atyayanina _h_ and others. The Mahabhashya, on the\nother hand, is not quite so explicit. It merely says that the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkani Brahma _n_ ani &c. ought to have been excepted, because they, too\n(api), are of the same age. Goldstucker naturally took this explanation to\nconvey the same meaning as that of Kaiya _t_ a. This view was, however,\ncontroverted by\n\np. xxxvii\n\n[paragraph continues] Professor Weber in his review of Goldstucker's 'Pa _n_\nini.' The interpretation of the varttika adopted in the Ka _s_ ika V _ri_ tti\n--according to which Pa _n_ ini's rule does not apply to those works, because\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya and others are not old authorities in the sense of Pa _n_\nini's rule--is likewise rejected by him, since in that case Katyayana's\nexception would be no exception at all. On the other hand, Professor Weber\nthinks that, if we accept Kaiya _t_ a's interpretation, Katyayana's additional\nremark 'on account of contemporaneousness' would be entirely superfluous. He,\ntherefore, proposes, in the passage of the Mahabhashya, to take 'api' in the\nsense of 'even,' and to interpret the passage thus 1: 'Among the Brahma _n_ as\nand Kalpas proclaimed by the ancients, Pa _n_ ini ought to have made an\nexception in regard to Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya &c., because the Brahma _n_ as and\nKalpas proclaimed by them, though indeed going back to ancient (sages), are\nnevertheless contemporaneous (with Pa _n_ ini himself).' This rather\nparadoxical argumentation, on the part of Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali, would have to be\nunderstood to mean, that the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkani Brahma _n_ ani and similar\nworks, though ascribed to old authorities, are in reality modern productions;\nor--if we may venture to express it in somewhat different words--Pa _n_ ini\nought to have made an exception in regard to works which, in point of fact,\nare no exception at all. Now, if this be the correct interpretation, I can\nonly say this--that, had Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali been anxious to conceal his real\nmeaning, he could scarcely have done so more effectually than by choosing\nwords which, at first sight, look as clear as day.\n\nProfessor Buhler 2, who has recently touched upon this controversy, sides with\nKaiya _t_ a and Goldstucker; and I, too, can take no other view. But, like\nhim, I see no necessity for accepting the inferences which Goldstucker has\ndrawn from this varttika, viz. that we have to assume so long an interval\nbetween Pa _n_ ini and Katyayana, that authors, whom Katyayana considered as\nfar older than Pa _n_ ini, were in reality his contemporaries. This\nassumption, surely, would involve a degree of ignorance, on the part of\n\np. xxxviii\n\n[paragraph continues] Katyayana, regarding the age of Pa _n_ ini, such as\nwould seem altogether unaccountable. The weakness of Goldstucker's argument\nlies in his identification of the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkani Brahma _n_ ani with the\nBrahma _n_ a of the Va _g_ asaneyins. With Professor Weber I believe that Pa\n_n_ ini was perfectly well acquainted with the term 'Va _g_ asaneyina _h_ ,'\nbut saw no occasion for specially mentioning it in his rules. Surely, if his\nsilence could possibly have been construed into an act of negligence,\nKatyayana, who was so intimately connected with the White Ya _g_ us that, on\nGoldstucker's own showing, he composed the Va _g_ asaneyi-prati _s_ akhya\nbefore he wrote his varttikas, would have been the first to notice it. The Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkani Brahma _n_ ani, in their relation to the sacred canon of the\nschool, seem to me to stand somewhat on a par with the 'Tittiri _n_ a prokta\n_h_ _s_ loka _h_  1,' which, in Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali's time, were excluded from\nthe term 'Taittiriya _h_ ' as uncanonical, and which Professor Weber would\nidentify, perhaps rightly, with some portions of the Taittiriyara _n_ yaka.\nBoth kinds of tracts probably belong to the last floating materials of\nAdhvaryu tradition, which had not yet been incorporated with the canon.\nWhether or not the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkani Brahma _n_ ani form part of the text of\nthe _S_ atapatha which has come down to us, and what exact portions of that\ntext we have to understand by this designation, must remain uncertain for the\npresent. Most probably, however, we have to look for them to certain portions\nof the last book (or books) in which Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya figures so\nprominently. If we had a complete copy of the Ka _n_ va recension, we might\nperhaps be in a better position for forming an opinion on this subject; for if\nthat version should really turn out to consist of 104 adhyayas, four of these\nadhyayas may have to be considered as a later interpolation; and the fact\nmight have become obscured in the Madhyandina recension by a different\ndivision of the text 2. But, however this may\n\np. xxxix\n\nbe, it appears to me quite intelligible why such portions should have been\nconsidered as of equal age to the body of the work; in fact they would\nprobably go back to about the same time as some of the earlier portions; only\nthat, owing to a longer state of uncertain transmission, they may have been\nmore liable to changes and additions. If these tracts are not mentioned by Pa\n_n_ ini, it may be an accidental omission on his part, or he may not have been\naware of their existence, for geographical or other reasons: we can hardly\nexpect Pa _n_ ini to have been so intimately acquainted with the Ya _g_ us\ntexts as Katyayana. As regards the dates of Katyayana and Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali, I\naccept with Professor Buhler and others, as by far the most probable, the\nfourth and the middle of the second century B.C. respectively.\n\nUnder the title of Va _g_ asaneyaka, the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a is quoted\nonce in La _t_ yayana's _S_ rauta-sutra IV, 12, 12; but I have not been able\nto find the passage either in the Madhyandina text or in that part of the Ka\n_n_ va text which I have hitherto had at my disposal, viz. ka _n_ _d_ as I,\nII, IV-VII (Ka _n_ va). Far more frequently the work is quoted, either as Va\n_g_ asaneyaka or as Va _g_ asaneyi-brahma _n_ a, by \xc3\x82pastamba, both in his _S_\nrauta and his Dharma-sutras. On comparing one of these quotations in the\nDharma-sutras (I, 4, 12, 3) with the corresponding passage in the Madhyandina\nrecension, Professor Buhler found that its wording possessed just sufficient\nresemblance to allow us to identify the passage which \xc3\x82pastamba meant, but\ndiffered from the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a in many details 1.' From this he\nnaturally inferred that \xc3\x82pastamba probably took his quotations from the Ka _n_\nva recension. Now, although I have not been able to compare this particular\npassage with the Ka _n_ va text 2, I have done so regarding a number of other\npassages quoted from \xc3\x82pastamba in Karka's commentary on the Katiya- _S_ rauta-\nsutra. The result was that in no single case did \xc3\x82pastamba's quotations agree\nwith the corresponding passages in the Ka _n_ va,\n\np. xl\n\nany more than they did with those of the Madhyandina text 1. In some cases\nthey came nearer to the one text, in others to the other. To several\nquotations, again, I could find nothing corresponding in either text. Now,\nsupposing the quotations, as given by Karka, to be on the whole correct, there\nseem to be only two ways of accounting for these discrepancies, viz. either\n\xc3\x82pastamba did not mean to quote the passages literally, but only to give the\nsubstance of there; or he had a third recension of the _S_ atapatha before\nhim. While some passages would seem to be in favour of the former alternative,\nothers would scarcely admit of this explanation. This question, however,\nrequires further investigation, before it can be definitely settled. In\nconnection with this question the fact will also have to be taken into\naccount, that Katyayana, in composing his Va _g_ asaneyi-prati _s_ akhya,\nseems to have had before him a different recension of the Sa _m_ hita, from\nthose of the Ka _n_ va and Madhyandina schools 2.\n\nProfessor Buhler appears to be inclined to place \xc3\x82pastamba somewhere about the\nfifth century B.C.; and though probably he himself does not consider the\nreasons he adduces as conclusive, they seem at any rate to show that that\nwriter cannot have lived later than the third century B. C. From\n\np. xli\n\nthe fact that _S_ vetaketu, the son of Uddalaka \xc3\x82ru _n_ i, the reputed teacher\n(and rival 1) of Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, is counted by \xc3\x82pastamba among the Avaras\nor moderns, Dr. Buhler infers that the promulgator of the White Ya _g_ us\ncannot have preceded \xc3\x82pastamba 'by a longer interval than, at the utmost, two\nor three hundred years.' That the two authors may not have been separated from\neach other by a longer interval seems likely enough; hut, on the other hand,\n\xc3\x82pastamba, by his remark, pays no very great compliment to the inspired texts\nof his own school, since Aru _n_ a Aupave _s_ i, the grandfather of _S_\nvetaketu \xc3\x82ru _n_ eya, is twice referred to in the Taittiriya-sa _m_ hita 2.\n\nThe geographical and ethnical allusions contained in the _S_ atapatha-brahma\n_n_ a have been carefully collected by Professor Weber 3. With the exception\nof those in ka _n_ _d_ as 6-10, as I have already remarked, they point almost\nexclusively to the regions along the Ganges and Jumna. In the legend about\nVidegha Mathava 4, and his Purohita Gotama Rahuga _n_ a, tradition seems to\nhave preserved a reminiscence of the eastward spread of Brahmanical\ncivilisation. Among the peoples that occupied those regions, a prominent\nposition is assigned in the _S_ atapatha to the closely-allied Kuru-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\nalas. The Kurus occupied the districts between the Jumna and Ganges--the so-\ncalled Madhyade _s_ a or middle country--and the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas bordered on\nthem towards the south-east. According to _S_ at. Br. XIII, 5, 4, 7, the Pa\n_\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas were in olden times called Krivi; and a tribe of this name is\nevidently referred to in Rig-veda VIII; 20, 24; (22, 12) 5, in connection with\nthe rivers Sindhu and Asikni. The Kurus, on the other hand, are not directly\nreferred to in the _Ri_ k; but a king Kuru _s_ rava _n_ a, 'glory of the\nKurus,' and a patron with the epithet Kauraya _n_ a are mentioned in the\nhymns. In Aitar. Br. VIII, 14, the Uttara (northern) Kurus, together with the\nUttara-Madras, are said to dwell beyond the Himalaya.\n\np. xlii\n\n[paragraph continues] From these indications Professor Zimmer infers that, in\nthe times of the hymns, the Kurus and Krivis--whose names evidently are merely\nvariations of the same word--may have lived together in the valleys of Ka _s_\nmir, on the upper Indus; and he also offers the ingenious conjecture, that we\nmay have to look for the Kuru-Krivis in the twin-people of the Vaikar _n_ au,\nmentioned in Rig-Veda VII, 18, 11. The names of the principal teachers of the\n_S_ atapatha mark them as belonging to the land of the Kuru-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas;\nand as in I, 7, 2, 8, preference is given to a certain sacrificial practice on\nthe ground that it is the one obtaining among these peoples, it seems highly\nprobable that the redaction of the work, or at least of the older portion of\nit, took place among the Kuru-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas 1. A prince 2 of Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala,\nPravaha _n_ a _G_ aivali, is mentioned XIV, 9, 1, 1, in connection with Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya's teacher, Uddalaka \xc3\x82ru _n_ i.\n\nEast of the Madhyade _s_ a, we meet with another confederacy of kindred\npeoples, of hardly less importance than the Kuru-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas, at the time\nof the redaction of the Brahma _n_ a, viz. the Kosala-Videhas. In the legend\nabove referred to they are said to be the descendants of Videgha Mathava, and\nto be separated from each other by the river Sadanira (either the modern Ga\n_n_ _d_ aki or Karatoya). The country of the Videhas, the eastern branch of\nthis allied people, corresponding to the modern Tirhut or Puraniya, formed in\nthose days the extreme east of the land of the \xc3\x82ryas. In the later books of\nthe _S_ atapatha, king _G_ anaka of Videha appears as one of the principal\npromoters of the Brahmanical religion, and especially as the patron of Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya. In XI, 6, 2, 1, _G_ anaka is represented\n\np. xliii\n\nas meeting, apparently for the first time, with _S_ vetaketu \xc3\x82ru _n_ eya, Soma\n_s_ ushma Satyaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ i, and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, while they were\ntravelling (dhavayadbhi _h_ ). Probably we are to understand by this that\nthese divines had then come from the west to visit the Videha country. A\nconsiderable portion of the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka deals with learned\ndisputations which Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya was supposed to have held at _G_ anaka's\ncourt with divers sages and with the king himself. In B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. II, 1, 1\n(and Kaush. Up. IV, 1) _G_ anaka's fame as the patron of Brahmanical sages is\nsaid to have aroused the jealousy of his contemporary, A _g_ ata _s_ atru,\nking of the Ka _s_ is 1. The name _G_ anaka is also interesting on account of\nits being borne likewise by the father of Sita, the wife of Rama.\nUnfortunately, however, there is not sufficient evidence to show that the two\nkings are identical. With the legend of the other great epic, the _S_ atapatha\noffers more points of contact; but on this subject also no definite results\nhave as yet been obtained, it being still doubtful whether the internecine\nstrife between the royal houses of the Kurus and Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas which,\naccording to the late Professor Lassen, forms the central fact of the legend\nof the Mahabharata, had not yet taken place at the time of the _S_ atapatha-\nbrahma _n_ a, or whether it was already a thing of the past 2. In the\nMahabharata, I, 4723, Pa _n_ _d_ u, in speaking to his wife Kunti, mentions\n_S_ vetaketu, the son of the Maharshi Uddalaka, as having lived 'not long ago\n3.'\n\nAs regards the two recensions of the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a, this is hardly\nthe place to enter into any detailed discussion of their mutual relations. Nor\nis my acquaintance with the Ka _n_ va text as yet sufficiently extensive to do\njustice to this important question. I intend, however, to publish before long\na number of extracts from several ka _n_ _d_ as of this recension,--including\nthe text of all the\n\np. xliv\n\nlegends as well as other portions which seemed to me of special interest,--\nfrom which Sanskrit scholars will be able to form an opinion regarding the\nexact nature of the variations between the two versions. In my notes to the\npresent translation of the first two ka _n_ _d_ as, I have considered it\ndesirable occasionally to notice some of the variae lectiones of the Ka _n_ va\nschool; it should, however, be understood that these readings have been given\nsolely on the authority of the Oxford MS., for the loan of which I am deeply\nindebted to the liberality of the Curators of the Bodleian Library. With the\naid of the Paris MS., the use of which has also just been kindly granted to\nme, I hope soon to be able to verify these extracts. For most of the ka _n_\n_d_ as, from the fourth 1 onwards, our materials have been lately enriched by\na copy which Mr. Whitley Stokes has had made for Professor Weber from a\nBenares MS.\n\nThe various readings of the Ka _n_ va recension of the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_\nhita have been given in Professor Weber's edition, at the end of each ka _n_\n_d_ a. They may be said to consist either of mere verbal variations or of\nadditional mantras. In regard to these readings the Brahma _n_ a of the same\nschool exhibits a feature which may have an important bearing on the textual\ncriticism of the Sa _m_ hita. While the Brahma _n_ a generally shows the same\nverbal variations in the sacrificial texts as the Sa _m_ hita, it, as a rule,\ntakes no notice whatever of the additional mantras, but agrees in this respect\npretty closely with the Madhyandina text. Indeed, so far as I am able to\njudge, the two relations seem to coincide almost entirely, as far as the\nsubject-matter is concerned; the differences, considerable as they sometimes\nare, being rather of a grammatical and stylistic nature. Occasional omissions,\nwhich I have hitherto noticed 2, may perhaps turn out to be due to the\ncarelessness of scribes. As regards the additional mantras referred to, they\nmay have found their way into the Sa _m_ hita at the time when the Sutras\n\np. xlv\n\nwere composed; though, it is true, they do not as a rule appear in the Katiya-\nsutra, and no other sutra of the White Ya _g_ us, as far as I know, has\nhitherto come to light 1. On the other hand, as there are also not a few\nmantras in the Madhyandina Sa _m_ hita 2,which are not noticed in the Brahma\n_n_ a of that school, this question must be left for future investigation.\n\nI have already referred to the connection which seems to have existed between\nthe Ka _n_ va school of the White Ya _g_ us and the redactors of the _Ri_ k-sa\n_m_ hita. One of the chief points of contact between our existing recension of\nthe _Ri_ k and the Ka _n_ va, text of the Ya _g_ ur-veda is the use of the\nletters _h_ and _lh_ instead of _d_ and _dh_ used by the Madhyandinas.\nBesides, the _ri_ _k_ s of the Ka _n_ va text generally approach mare nearly\nto the readings of the Rig-veda than those of the other school. Another, even\nmore interesting, feature which the Ka _n_ va recension has in common with the\n_Ri_ k, is the constant 3 employment of the ordinary genitive and ablative of\nfeminine bases, where the other Sa _m_ hitas and Brahma _n_ as generally use\nthe dative; thus the Ka _n_ vas read 'tasya _h_ ' instead of 'tasyai' (M. I,\n1, 4, 16); 'gayatrya _h_ ' instead of 'gayatryai' (I, 7, 1, 1); 'p _ri_ thivya\n_h_ ' instead of 'p _ri_ thivyai' (I, 2, 5, 18); 'kumbhya bhastraya _h_ '\ninstead of 'kumbhyai bhastrayai' (I, 1, 2, 7); 'stir _n_ aya vede _h_ '\ninstead of 'stir _n_ ayai vede _h_ ' (IV, 2, 5, 3); 'dheno _h_ ' instead of\n'dhenvai' (III, 1, 2, 21), &c. Thus the Ka _n_ va text is in this respect more\nin accordance with the _Ri_ k-sa _m_ hita than even the Aitareya-Brahma _n_ a\n4. Again, the Ka _n_ vas seem to form the dative of feminine i-bases in\naccordance with the usual and older practice of the _Ri_ k; at least I find\neverywhere 'ahutaye' and 'guptaye' (as also in the Atharvan) instead of\n'ahutyai' and 'guptyai' as the Madhyandinas (and Taittiriyas) read 5. Of minor\npoints of grammatical\n\np. xlvi\n\ndifferences may be mentioned the form 'nililye,' which occurs once in the\nMadhyandina text (I, 2, 3, 1), and is otherwise only found in the Mahabharata;\nwhile the Ka _n_ va recension has the periphrastic form (nilaya _m_ _k_ akre),\nwhich the Madhyandina text also offers in the other two cases (I, 6, 4, 1; IV,\n1, 3, 1) in which the word occurs. On the other hand, the Ka _n_ vas seem to\nread invariably 'atmani (dha or k _ri_ ),' where the Madhyandinas have\n'atman,' which is also (doubtless on metrical grounds) the more usual\nformation in the Rig-veda 1. Of cases of material differences I can only at\npresent adduce the passage I, 1, 4, 12 (M.), where the Madhyandina text is\nguilty of a transposition of the second and third castes, while that of the Ka\n_n_ vas gives them in the proper order. Though most of these points of\ndifference between the two schools would seem to tell in favour of the higher\nantiquity of the Ka _n_ va text, there will always be great difficulty in\ndeciding this question, as it is by no means impossible that these variations\nare entirely due to different local or family traditions. In favour of the\nlatter alternative one or two other points may be mentioned. The Madhyandina\ntext, as has already been remarked, offers not a few grammatical and other\ndifferences between the first five and the succeeding four ka _n_ _d_ as, or,\nas we may say, between the Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya and the _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya books\nof the Shash _t_ ipatha. Though I cannot speak with confidence on this point,\nas I have not yet examined the Ka _n_ va text of the _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya ka _n_\n_d_ as, I may refer here to at least two points, in which the Ka _n_ vas, in\nthe Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya portion, agree with the _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya portion of\nthe Madhyandina text, viz. the use of the imperfect (aspardhanta) instead of\nthe perfect (pasp _ri_ dhire) in the opening clause of legends; and the\nfrequent employment of the particle 'vava' in the place of 'vai.'\n\nAs regards the present translation of the first two ka _n_ _d_ as,\n\np. xlvii\n\n[paragraph continues] I need hardly say that I am fully aware of its\nshortcomings. My chief endeavour has been to translate as literally as seemed\nat all compatible with the English idiom. If, in consequence of this, many\npassages should be found to read somewhat awkwardly, I hope at least that the\nwish to follow the original as closely as possible, has not rendered them\nunintelligible. Those who have given any attention to the Brahma _n_ as and\nthe sacrificial system of the Hindus, know how difficult the task is, and how\neasy it is to commit mistakes regarding the intricate minutiae of the\nceremonial. The Brahma _n_ as presuppose a full knowledge of the course of\nsacrificial performance, and notice only such points as afford an opportunity\nfor dogmatic and symbolic explanations, or seem to call for some authoritative\ndecision to guard them against what were considered as heretical practices. In\norder to enable the reader to follow the course of the performance with\nsomething like completeness, I have supplied in my notes the chief details\nfrom Katyayana's Kalpa-sutras. That not a few of these details did not belong\nto the sacrificial ceremonial of the _S_ atapatha, but were the result of\nlater development, or of an adaptation of sacrificial practices of other\nschools, can scarcely be doubted. Dr. Hillebrandt 1 is of opinion that\nsacrificial manuals, somewhat similar to the later Prayogas, must have existed\nas early as the time of the composition of the Brahma _n_ as. In the absence\nof any direct evidence, speculation on this point can scarcely lead to any\ndefinite results. I may say, however, that it seems to me quite sufficient to\nassume that the performance of sacrifices was taught as a practical art, and\nthat the theoretic instruction, supplied by the Brahma _n_ as, was conveyed\norally in connection with such practical performances. That the latter was the\ncase, is sufficiently evident from the constant occurrence in the Brahma _n_\nas of demonstrative pronouns and particles of a 'deictic' force 2.\n\nI have occasionally referred to corresponding passages of the Taittiriyas: an\nexhaustive comparison of the two branches of the Ya _g_ ur-veda, however\ninteresting this might be, lay outside the scope of my notes. A general view\nof\n\np. xlviii\n\nthe sacrificial system might be considered desirable in this place; but I have\nfound it necessary to defer this part of my duty as translator to some future\nopportunity. Those who desire further information on this point, I may refer\nto Professor Weber's general survey of Hindu sacrifices, in vols. x and xiii\nof his Indische Studien. No other scholar has contributed so much to our\nknowledge of the sacrificial. ceremonial of the Hindus. I need hardly say that\nI have also obtained much useful information from the late Professor Haug's\nnotes to his translation of the Aitareya-brahma _n_ a, although on many points\nthe practices of modern _S_ rotriyas, on which he chiefly relied, are\nmanifestly at variance with those enjoined by the old ritualistic authorities.\nFor the first ka _n_ _d_ a, I have also been able to avail myself of Dr.\nHillebrandt's careful exposition of the new and full-moon sacrifice; and\nthough I had already worked myself through that part of the ritual before the\nappearance of his treatise, his constant references to the Sutras of the Black\nYa _g_ ur-veda have been of great assistance to me.\n\nThe Brahma _n_ as and Kalpa-sutras treat of the so-called _S_ rauta or Vaidik\nsacrifices, requiring for their performance three sacrificial fires; while the\nPaka-ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, or simple oblations of cooked food prepared on the\ndomestic fire, are dealt with in the G _ri_ hya-sutras. The present volume\ncontains that portion of the Brahma _n_ a which deals with the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nas--or offerings of milk, butter, rice, barley, and similar materials--as\ndistinguished from the animal and Soma sacrifices. The new and full-moon\noffering being considered as the normal type of an ish _t_ i, or simplest form\nof a complete sacrificial performance, the place of honour is assigned to it\nin most texts of the Ya _g_ us; only points of difference being generally\nnoted regarding the performance of ish _t_ is, as parts of subsequent\nsacrifices. In point of time, the Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasau ought to be preceded\n--as indeed they are in the Ka _n_ va text of the Brahma _n_ a--by the\nAgnyadhana, or establishment of a sacred fire on the part of a young\nhouseholder; and by the Agnihotra, or morning and evening libations.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[ix:1](sbe1202.htm#fr_0) A.

S. 14, 28-30); and in several passages of the _Ri_ k this god appears\nto be identical with, or at least kindred to, Agni, the purohita and priest\n(see Max Muller, Translation of Rig-veda, I, 77; J. Muir, Original Sanskrit\nTexts, V, p. 272 seq.) In Rig-veda X, 68, 9, where B _ri_ haspati is said to\nhave found (avindat) the dawn, the sky, and the fire (agni), and to have\nchased away darkness with his light (arka, sun), he seems rather to represent\nthe element of light and fire generally (das Ur-licht, cf. Va _g_. S. IX,\n10-12). In the second p. xvii Ma _n_ _d_ ala the hymns to B _ri_ haspati are\nplaced immediately after those to Agni and Indra. Though the abstract\nconception represented by this deity may seem a comparatively modern one, it\nwill by no means be easy to prove from the text of the hymns addressed to him,\nthat these are modern. It would almost seem as if two different tendencies of\nadoration had existed side by side from olden times; the one, a more popular\nand sensuous one, which, in Vedic times, found its chief expression in Indra\nand his circle of deities; and the other, a more spiritual one, represented\noriginally by Varu _n_ a (Mitra, &c.; cf., however, _S_ at. Br. IV, 1, 4,\n1-4), and in Vedic times, when the sacerdotal element more and more asserted\nitself, by B _ri_ haspati, and especially by Agni. The identification of this\ngod with the priestly office was as happy as it was natural; for Agni, the\ngenial inmate of every household, is indeed vai _s_ vanara, the friend of all\nmen. Shadowy conceptions, such as B _ri_ haspati and Brahman, on the other\nhand, could evoke no feelings of sympathy in the hearts of the people\ngenerally. Of peculiar interest, in this respect, are the hymns in which Agni\nis associated with Indra (see Max Muller's Science of Language, Second Series,\np. 495 J. Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, V, pp. 219, 220), and the passages in\nwhich Agni has ascribed to him functions which legitimately belong to Indra;\nviz. the slaying of V _ri_ tra and destruction of the enemies' cities. The\nmutual relation of Indra and Varu _n_ a has been well discussed in Dr.\nHillebrandt's treatise 'Varu _n_ a and Mitra,' p. 97 seq. It is most concisely\nexpressed by Vasish _th_ a, Rig-veda VII, 83, 9, 'The one (Indra) slays the\nenemies in battles; the other (Varu _n_ a) ever defends the ordinances.'\n\n[xvii:1](sbe1202.htm#fr_13) See the present volume, p. 48 note; R.

Haug, who\nbelieved in the identity of the Vedic Adhvaryu and the Zota and Rathwi of the\nZend-Avesta:--'At the most ancient times it appears that all the sacrificial\nformulas were spoken by the Hotar alone; the Adhvaryu was only his assistant,\nwho arranged the sacrificial compound, provided the implements, and performed\nall manual labour. It was only at the time when regular metrical verses and\nhymns were introduced into the ritual, that a part of the duties of the Hotar\ndevolved on the Adhvaryu. p. xxi There are in the present ritual traces to be\nfound, that the Hotar actually must have performed part of the duties of the\nAdhvaryu.'

Br. IV, 6, 7, 6, the _Ri_ _k_ and Saman are identified with Speech,\nand the Ya _g_ us with the Mind.\n\n[xxvi:1](sbe1202.htm#fr_33) Except, perhaps, the Sama-veda, which, in the _K_\nara _n_ avyuha, is said to have counted a thousand schools; though that work\nitself enumerates only seven schools, one of them with five subdivisions. The\nnumber of teachers mentioned in connection with this Veda is, however, very\nconsiderable.\n\n[xxvi:2](sbe1202.htm#fr_34) As such, at least, the Taittiriyas are mentioned\nin the _K_ ara _n_ avyuha. The term Karaka, however, is also (e _g_. in the\nPrati _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a-sutra) applied to the schools of the Black Ya _g_ us\ngenerally. If the Berlin MS. of the Ka _th_ aka professes, in the colophon, to\ncontain the Karaka text of the work (which Professor Weber takes to refer to\nthe _K_ araya _n_ iyah), the Karaka- _s_ akha of the Ka _th_ aka has perhaps\nto be understood in contradistinction to those portions of the Ka _th_ aka\nwhich have been adopted by the Taittiriyas and incorporated into their Brahma\n_n_ a.\n\n[xxvi:3](sbe1202.htm#fr_35) The Taittiriyas divide themselves into two\nschools, the Aukhiyas and the Kha _n_ _d_ ikiyas; the \xc3\x82pastambins are a\nsubdivision of the latter branch. We have also the list of the contents\n(anakrama _n_ i) of the \xc3\x82treyas, a subdivision of the Aukhiyas.\n\n[xxvii:1](sbe1202.htm#fr_36) It has come down to us in two different\nrecensions, the Aitareya and the Kaushitaki (or _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana) Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[xxvii:2](sbe1202.htm#fr_37) Professor Weber, however, thinks there may be\nsome reason for this derivation; the name of Taittiriya having perhaps been\napplied to this school on account of the motley (partridge-like) character of\nits texts. According to the story alluded to, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, having been\ntaught the old Ya _g_ us texts by Vai _s_ ampayana, incurred the displeasure\nof his teacher, and was forced by him to disgorge the sacred science which, on\nfalling to the ground, became soiled p. xxviii (hence Black Ya _g_ us), and\nwas picked up by Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya's condisciples, who had assumed the form\nof partridges. This story seems first to occur in the Pura _n_ as; see\nWilson's translation of the Vish _n_ u Pura _n_ a (ed. Hall), III, p. 54. Pa\n_n_ ini (IV, 3, 102) and Pata _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ali only know of the Taittiriya texts as\n'promulgated by Tittiri.'\n\n[xxviii:1](sbe1202.htm#fr_38) Zeitsch. der D. M. G., IV, p. 289 seq.;\nreprinted in Indische Streifen I, p. 31 seq.\n\n[xxix:1](sbe1202.htm#fr_39) The Ka _n_ va text is divided into seventeen\nbooks. Ka _n_ _d_ as 12-15 correspond to Madhyandina 10-13; and ka _n_ _d_ a\n16, which treats [of](errata.htm#2) the Pravargya ceremony, corresponds to the\nfirst three adhyayas of the last ka _n_ _d_ a of the Madhyandinas. Thus, in\nthe Ka _n_ va recension the fourteenth ka _n_ _d_ a, called 'madhyama,' is the\nmiddle one of ka _n_ _d_ as 12-16; the seventeenth ka _n_ _d_ a, or B _ri_\nhadara _n_ yaka, being apparently considered as a supplement. Perhaps this\ndivision is more original than that of the Madhyandinas.\n\n[xxx:1](sbe1202.htm#fr_40) The accuracy of this list cannot he relied upon, as\nseveral mistakes occur in the number of ka _n_ _d_ ikas there given. It is,\nhowever, unlikely that the scribe should have committed any mistake regarding\nthe number of adhyayas.\n\n[xxx:2](sbe1202.htm#fr_41) Literally 'together with the rahasya (sarahasyam),'\n&c.\n\n[xxx:3](sbe1202.htm#fr_42) History of Indian Literature, p. 507 seq.\n\n[xxxi:1](sbe1202.htm#fr_43) See, however, _S_ at.

It seems to me, however, that if the va\n_m_ _s_ as are at all authentic--and I see no reason for doubt as far as the\ntwo lists above referred to are concerned--we have rather to assume that the\nlists were kept from early times and gradually added to. On the other hand,\nlittle can be made of the two va _m_ _s_ as at the end of the Madhu and Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkiya ka _n_ _d_ as. They look rather like attempts--and very\nunsuccessful ones--at throwing several independent lists into one.\n\n[xxxiv:3](sbe1202.htm#fr_50) Viz., Vatsya IX, 5, 1, 62; Vamakakshaya _n_ a\nVII, 1, 2, 11; Mahitthi VI, 2, 2, 10; VIII, 6, 1, 16 seq.; IX, 5, 1, 57. Not\nmentioned are Kautsa, Ma _n_ _d_ avya, and Ma _n_ _d_ ukayani.

The Ka _s_ ika V _ri_ tti gives\nthe patronymics of Gargiputra and Vatsiputra, both of whom occur in our va _m_\n_s_ a. It is worthy of remark that Kavasha Ailusha, who is mentioned in Ait.\nBr.

Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. I, 191,\ntries to get over this difficulty by translating Kurupa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alatra by 'as\namong the Kuru-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas,' instead of among the Kuru-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas;'\nso that the meaning of the passage would be that 'the same language is spoken\nin the northern region, as among the Kuru-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas.' Unfortunately,\nhowever, the Ka _n_ va text of the passage is not favourable to this\ninterpretation. It runs as follows (K. IV. a, 3, 10):--udi _k_ im pathyaya\nsvastya vag vai pathya svastis tasmad atrottarahai vag vadatityahu _h_ kurupa\n_\xc3\xb1_ _k_ aleshu kurumahavisheshv ity eta _m_ hi taya di _s_ a _m_ pra _g_ anann\nesha hi tasya dik pra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ata.\n\n[xlii:2](sbe1202.htm#fr_69) He is styled ra _g_ anyabandhu in _Kh_ andogyop.\nV, 3, 5.\n\n[xliii:1](sbe1202.htm#fr_70) They occupied the country about the modern\nBenares (Ka _s_ i).\n\n[xliii:2](sbe1202.htm#fr_71) Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra Vai _k_ itravirya, whose\nsons and nephews form the chief parties of this great feud, is mentioned in\nthe Ka _th_ aka 10, 6. From this passage--which, unfortunately, is not in a\nvery good condition in the Berlin MS.--it would appear that animosities had\nthen existed between the Kurus and Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas.

Br. p. 418.\n\n[xlv:5](sbe1202.htm#fr_79) See also the form 'dheno _h_ ' mentioned above.\n\n[xlvi:1](sbe1202.htm#fr_80) Another curious feature of the Ka _n_ va text is\nthe frequent insertion of an 'ity uva _k_ a' in the middle of speeches, much\nlike the colloquial 'says he.' As an instance I may adduce K. IV, 2, 3, 3 (M.\nIII, 2, 3, 5):--Sa hova _k_ a 'ham eva vo ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am amumuham iti hova _k_\na yad eva mayi tanvana iti ma _m_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ad antaragata tenaiva vo ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ am amumuham iti to mahya _m_ nu bhaga _m_ kalpayatety atha vo ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\n_h_ praro _k_ ishyata hi tatheti ho _k_ us, &c. The Ka _n_ vas also invert\nmuch more frequently an 'iti' in the middle of speeches.\n\n[xlvii:1](sbe1202.htm#fr_81) Das Altindische Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. xv.\n\n[xlvii:2](sbe1202.htm#fr_82) See, for instance, _S_ at. Br. I, 3, 1, 7; 8, 1,\n14.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 1. First Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe1203.htm)\n\n"
