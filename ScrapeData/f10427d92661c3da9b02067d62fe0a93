They took with them\ntheir mother, Queen Pritha, and their wife, Draupadi, and the people went\nforth in great multitudes and bade them glad welcome. Then there was much\nrejoicing and many banquets.\n\nAt length Dhritarashtra spake unto Yudhishthira and his brethren and said: "I\nwill now divide the raj between you and my sons. Your share will be the south-\nwestern country of Khandava-prastha."\n\nSaid Bhishma: "The maharajah hath spoken wisely. It is meet that you should\ndepart unto the country of Khandava-prastha as he hath decreed."\n\nSo the Pandava princes bade farewell to all their kinsmen and to wise Drona,\nand they went towards their own country. On the banks of the Jumna they built\na strong fort, and in time they made a great clearance in the forest. When\nthey had gathered together the people who were subject unto them, they erected\na great and wonderful city like unto the city of Indra, and it was\n\np. 225\n\ncalled Indra-prastha. 1 High walls, which resembled the Mandara mountains,\nwere built round about, and these were surrounded by a deep moat wide as the\nsea.\n\nIn time the fame of Rajah Yudhishthira went far and wide. He ruled with wisdom\nand with power, and he had great piety. Forest robbers were pursued constantly\nand put to death, and wrongdoers were ever brought to justice; indeed, the\npeople who suffered from evildoing went before the rajah as children go before\na father seeking redress.\n\nThe brethren lived happily together. In accordance with the advice of a Rishi,\nthey made a compact that when one of them was sitting beside Draupadi, none of\nthe others should enter, and that if one of them should be guilty of\nintrusion, he must needs go into exile for the space of twelve years.\n\nAs it chanced, Yudhishthira was sitting with Draupadi one day when a Brahman,\nwhose cattle had been carried off, hastened to Arjuna and entreated him to\npursue the band of robbers. The weapons of the prince were in the king\'s\npalace, and to obtain them Arjuna entered the room in which Yudhishthira and\nDraupadi sat, thus breaking the compact made by the brethren. He hastened\nafter the robbers and recovered the stolen cattle, which he brought back unto\nthe Brahman.\n\nOn his return to the palace, Arjuna said unto his brother that he must needs\nbecome an exile for twelve years to expiate his offence. Yudhishthira,\nhowever, sought to prevail upon him not to depart. But Arjuna made answer that\nhe had pledged his oath to fulfil the terms of the compact. "I cannot waver\nfrom truth," he said; "truth is my weapon." So when he had bidden farewell to\nPritha and Draupadi and his four brethren,\n\np. 226\n\nhe took his departure from the city of Indra-prastha. And a band of Brahmans\nwent with him.\n\nArjuna wandered through the jungle, and he visited many holy places. One day\nhe went unto Hurdwar, where the Ganges flows upon the plain, and he bathed in\nthe holy waters. There he met with Ulupi, daughter of Vasuka, king of the\nNagas, who had great beauty. She loved him, and she led him to her father\'s\npalace, where he abode a time, and she gave him the power to render himself\ninvisible in water. A child was born unto them, and he was named Iravat.\n\nThereafterwards Arjuna went southwards until he came to the Mahendra mountain.\n1 He was received there by Parasu Rama, the Brahman hero, who gave him gifts\nof powerful weapons, and imparted to him the secret of using them.\n\nSo he wandered from holy place to holy place until he reached Manipur. Now the\nrajah of that place had a beautiful daughter whose name was Chitrangada.\nArjuna loved her, and sought her for his bride. The rajah said: "I have no\nother child, and if I give her unto thee, her son must remain here to become\nmy heir, for the god Shiva hath decreed that the rajahs of this realm can have\neach but one child." Arjuna married the maiden, and he dwelt for three years\nat Manipur. A son was born, and he was named Chitrangada. Thereafter Arjuna\nset out on his wanderings once more.\n\nHe passed through many strange lands, travelling westward, and at length he\nreached the city of Prabhasa 2, which is nigh to Dwaraka, on the southern sea,\nthe capital of his kinsman Krishna, rajah of the Yadhavas.\n\nKrishna welcomed Arjuna, and took the Pandava hero to dwell in his palace.\nThen he gave a great feast on\n\n\n\n[![ARJUNA AND THE RIVER NYMPH<br> <i>From the painting by Warwick\nGoble</i>.](tn/22600.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/22600.jpg)  \nARJUNA AND THE RIVER NYMPH  \n_From the painting by Warwick Goble_.  \n\n\n\np. 227\n\nthe holy mountain of Raivataka, which lasted for two days. Arjuna looked with\nlove upon Krishna\'s fair sister, Subhadra 1, a girl of sweet smiles, and\ndesired her for a bride.\n\nNow it was the wish of Balarama that Subhadra should he given unto Duryodhana,\nwhom, indeed, she would have chosen had a swayamvara been held. So Krishna\nadvised Arjuna to carry her away by force, in accordance with the advice of\nthe sages, who had said aforetime: "Men applaud the Kshatriyas who win brides\nby abducting them."\n\nWhen the feast was over, Arjuna drove his chariot from the holy mountain\ntowards Dwaraka until he came nigh to Subhadra. Nimbly he leapt down and took\nher by the hand and lifted her into his chariot; then he drove hastily towards\nthe city of Indra-prastha.\n\nBalarama was greatly angered, and desired to pursue Arjuna; and he spoke to\nKrishna, saying: "Thou art calm, and I can perceive that Arjuna has done this\nthing with thy knowledge. Thou shouldst not have given our sister unto him\nwithout my consent. But let the deed be upon his own head, for I will pursue\nhim and slay him and his brethren, one and all."\n\nSaid Krishna: "Arjuna is our kinsman 2 and of noble birth, and is a worthy\nhusband for Subhadra. If thou wilt pursue him and bring back our sister, no\none else will marry her now because that she hath been in the house of\nanother. Better were it that we should send messengers after Arjuna and invite\nhim to return here, so that the marriage may be held according to our rites."\n\nBalarama said: "So be it, seeing that thou art well pleased with this matter."\n\np. 228\n\nThus it came to pass that messengers followed Arjuna and prevailed upon him to\nreturn with Subhadra to Dwaraka. A great feast was then held, and they were\nmarried with pomp and in state. And Arjuna abode at the court of Krishna for\nmany months, until the time of his exile came to an end.\n\nWhen Arjuna returned to Indra-prastha with Subhadra, he was received with\ngreat rejoicing by his brethren. He went unto Draupadi and greeted her; but\nshe said coldly: "Why come hither? Where is the sister of Krishna?"\n\nArjuna soothed her with gentle words; and then Subhadra approached Draupadi,\nattired in red silk, but in the simple fashion of a keeper of cows, and made\nobeisance before her, saying: "I am thy handmaiden."\n\nDraupadi embraced the sister of Krishna and said. "Let thy husband be without\nan enemy."\n\nThe heart of Subhadra was filled with joy at these words; she said: "So be\nit."\n\nThus was peace made; the two women thereafter loved one another, and to Pritha\nboth were very dear.\n\nNow Draupadi became the mother of five sons to her five husbands; and Subhadra\nhad one son only, and his name was Abhimanyu 1, who in the years that followed\nwas an illustrious warrior.\n\nAs time went on, the Pandavas grew more and more powerful. They waged great\nwars, until many rajahs owed them allegiance; and at length Yudhishthira\ndeemed that the time had come to hold his great Rajasuya sacrifice to\ncelebrate the supremacy of his power over all.\n\nKrishna came to Indra-prastha at this time and said: "There is now but one\nrajah who must needs be overcome\n\np. 229\n\nere the Imperial sacrifice can be performed: his name is Jarasandha, monarch\nof Magadha. He hath already conquered six-and-eighty kings, and he hath\nslaughtered those who were our kinsmen dear."\n\nNow this rajah was of great valour and matchless strength. His body was\ninvulnerable against weapons; not even the gods could wound him with mace or\nsword or with arrow. He was also of miraculous birth, for he was born of two\nmothers 1 who had eaten of a mantra-charmed mango which fell into the lap of\nhis sire when that he was childless and was undergoing penances to obtain\noffspring. Nor did the babe come to life after birth until he was united by a\nRakshasa woman, named Jara, the goddess of the household, who, because she was\nworshipped in the palace, performed some good each day in return. 2 So the\nchild was called Jarasandha 3, which signifies "united by Jara", and he\nincreased daily like to the moon in its first phase.\n\nKrishna said unto Yudhishthira: "This monarch of Magadha cannot be vanquished\nin battle even by gods or by demons. But he may be overcome in a conflict,\nfighting with bare arms. Now I am \'Policy\', Bhima is \'Strength\', and Arjuna is\n\'Protector\'. Together, O king, we will surely accomplish the death of\nJarasandha, who is arrogant and covetous and proud."\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "Do as it seemeth best unto thee, O lord of the universe;\nthou art our wise counsellor and guide."\n\nThen Krishna, Arjuna, and Bhima disguised themselves as Brahmans and went\ntowards the city of Mathura, which was Jarasandha\'s capital. When they arrived\nthere\n\np. 230\n\nthey entered the palace of the mighty rajah like to mountain lions eyeing\ncattle-folds. They went boldly before the king decked with flowers, and the\nking said: "Ye are welcome."\n\nArjuna and Bhima were silent, but Krishna spake to Jarasandha, saying: "These\ntwo men are observing vows, and will not open their mouths until midnight;\nafter that hour they will speak."\n\nThe king provided for his guests in the sacrificial chamber, and after\nmidnight he visited them, and discovering that they were warriors, he asked:\n"Tell me truly who ye are, and why ye have come hither."\n\nSaid Krishna: "We are decked with flowers to achieve prosperity, and we have\nentered the abode of our enemy to fulfil the vows of Kshatriyas."\n\nJarasandha said: "I have never done you an injury. Why, therefore, do ye\nregard me as your enemy?"\n\nThen Krishna revealed himself, and upbraided the king because that he was wont\nto offer up in sacrifice to Shiva the rajahs whom he took captive in battle.\nHe said: "Thou hast slaughtered our kinsmen in this manner because thou dost\nimagine there liveth no man who is so powerful as thou. For thy sins thou art\ndoomed to go to Yama\'s kingdom, there to be tortured a time. But thou canst\nattain to the Heaven of Indra by dying the death of a Kshatriya in battle with\nthy peers. Now, O king, we challenge thee to combat. Set free the rajahs who\nare in thy dungeons, or die at our hands!"\n\nSaid the king: "I have taken captive in battle these royal prisoners of mine,\nwhom I shall offer in sacrifice to Shiva, according to my vow. Let us\ntherefore meet in battle, army against army, or in single combat."\n\np. 231\n\nKrishna said: "Meet thou one of us in single combat. With whom dost thou\ndesire to fight?"\n\nThen Jarasandha expressed his wish to meet Bhima in battle. Bhima was made\nglad thereat, for, in truth, he thirsted for the conflict; but he desired that\nthey should fight without weapons, and the king consented, and made ready for\nthe fray.\n\nNow Jarasandha was of lofty stature and great strength, and he fought so\nfiercely that the combat lasted for thirteen days in presence of great\nmultitudes of the people. In the end the king was swung aloft, and his back\nwas broken over Bhima\'s knee. Then a mighty tumult arose, which caused all who\nwere there to quake with fear, for the roar of the Pandavas mingled with the\nshrieks of Jarasandha ere death silenced him.\n\nKrishna went boldly into the palace and set free all the rajahs who were in\ncaptivity. And one by one they took vows to attend the Imperial sacrifice.\nThen Krishna received Sahadeva, son of Jarasandha, and installed him as Rajah\nof Magadha.\n\nWhen the great Yudhishthira came to know that Jarasandha had been slain, he\nsent forth his four brethren with great armies to collect tribute from every\nrajah in the world. 1 Some there were among the kings who welcomed them;\nothers had to be conquered in battle. But when they had sworn allegiance to\nYudhishthira, they joined the Pandava force and assisted in achieving further\nvictories. A whole year went past ere the brethren returned again unto Indra-\nprastha.\n\nKrishna came from Dwaraka to aid Yudhishthira at the ceremony, and he brought\nwith him much wealth and a mighty army.\n\nStately pavilions were erected for the kings who came\n\np. 232\n\nto attend the great sacrifice: their turrets were high, and they were swan-\nwhite and flecked with radiant gold. Silver and gold adorned the walls of the\nrooms, which were richly perfumed and carpeted and furnished to befit the\nroyal guests.\n\nThen the rajahs came to Indra-prastha in all their splendour and greeted\nmighty Yudhishthira. Those who were friends brought gifts, and those who had\nbeen subdued in battle brought tribute. White-haired and blind old\nDhritarashtra came, and with him were Kripa and Bhishma and Vidura. Proud\nDuryodhana and his brethren came also, professing friendship, and Karna came\nwith bow and spear and mace. Drona and his son, and their enemies Drupada and\nhis son, were there also, and Balarama, Krishna\'s brother, and their father\nVasudeva. And among many others were jealous Sishupala 1, King of Chedi 2, and\nhis son, and both wore bright golden armour.\n\nMany Brahmans assembled at Indra-prastha, and Krishna honoured them and washed\ntheir feet. The gifts that were given to these holy sages were beyond\ncomputation. In great numbers came men of every caste also; and all were\nfeasted at banquets, so that the words "Take ye and eat" were heard\ncontinuously on every hand.\n\nNow there were deep and smouldering jealousies among the assembled rajahs, and\nwhen the time came to honour him who was regarded as the greatest among them\nby presenting the Arghya 3, their passions were set ablaze. First Bhishma\nspake forth and said that the honour was due to Krishna, the pious one, who\nwas the noblest and greatest among them all. "Krishna," he\n\np. 233\n\nsaid, "is the origin of all things; the universe came into being for him\nalone. He is the incarnation of the Creator, the everlasting one, who is\nbeyond man\'s comprehension."\n\nWhen the Arghya was given unto Krishna, Sishupala, the Rajah of Chedi, arose\nin wrath and said: "It ill becomes thee, O Yudhishthira, to honour thus an\nuncrowned chieftain. Gathered about thee are ruling kings of highest fame. If\nthe honour be due to age, then Vasudeva can claim it before his son; if it is\ndue to the foremost rajah, then Drupada should be honoured; if it is due to\nwisdom, Drona is the most worthy; if it is due to holiness, Vyasa is the\ngreatest. Drona\'s son hath more knowledge than Krishna, Duryodhana is peerless\namong younger men, Kripa is the worthiest priest, and Karna the greatest\narcher. For what reason should homage be paid unto Krishna, who is neither the\nholiest priest, the wisest preceptor, the greatest warrior, nor the foremost\nchieftain? To the shame of this assembly be it said that it doth honour the\nmurderer of his own rajah, this cowherd of low birth."\n\nSo spake Sishupala, the tiger-hearted one, and terrible was his wrath. He\nhated Krishna, because that he had carried away by force the beautiful\nRukmini, who had been betrothed unto himself, the mighty Rajah of Chedi.\n\nKrishna then spoke. Calm was he of voice and demeanour, but his eyes were\nbright. Unto the rajahs he said: "Hear me, O ye princes and kings! The evil-\ntongued Sishupala is descended from a daughter of our race, and in my heart I\nhave never sought to work ill against a kinsman. But once, when I went\neastward, he sacked my sea-swept Dwaraka and laid low its temple; once he\nbroke faith with a rajah and cast him into prison; once he seized the consort\nof a king by\n\np. 234\n\nforce; and once he disguised himself as the husband of a chaste princess and\ndeceived her. And I have suffered because of his sins, nor sought vengeance,\nbecause that he was of our own race. He hath even come after my consort\nRukmini, and is worthy of death."\n\nAs he spoke, the faces of many rajahs grew red with shame and anger, but\nSishupala laughed aloud and made answer: "I seek no mercy from Krishna, nor do\nI fear him."\n\nThen Krishna thought of his bright, resistless discus, and immediately it was\nin his hand. In anger he spake forth and said: "Hear me, ye lords of earth! I\nhave promised the pious mother of Sishupala to pardon a hundred sins committed\nby her son. And I have fulfilled my vow. But now the number is more than full,\nand I will slay him, O ye mighty rajahs, before your eyes."\n\nHaving spoken thus, Krishna flung the discus, and it struck Sishupala on the\nneck, so that his head was severed from his body. He fell down like to a cliff\nstruck by the thunderbolt. Then the assembled rajahs beheld a great wonder,\nfor the passion-cleansed soul of Sishupala issued from his body, beautiful as\nthe sun in heaven, and went towards Krishna. Its eyes were like to lotus\nblooms, and its form like to a flame; and it adored Krishna and entered into\nhis body. 1\n\nThe rajahs all looked on, silent and amazed, while thunder bellowed out of\nheaven, and lightning flashed, and rain poured down in torrents. Some grew\nangry, and laid hands on their weapons to avenge the death of Sishupala;\nothers rejoiced that he had been slain; the Brahmans chanted the praises of\nKrishna.\n\np. 235\n\nYudhishthira commanded his brothers to perform the funeral rites over the dead\nwith every honour. So the body of Sishupala was burned and the oblation poured\nforth. Then his son was proclaimed Rajah of Chedi.\n\nThereafter the great sacrifice was performed with solemnity and in peace.\nKrishna, who had maintained the supremacy of Yudhishthira by slaying a\ndangerous and jealous rival, looked on benignly.\n\nHoly water was sprinkled by the Brahmans, and all the monarchs made obeisance\nand honoured Yudhishthira, saying: "Thou hast extended the fame of thy mighty\nsire, Pandu, and thou art become even greater than he was. Thou hast graced\nwith this sacrifice thine high station and fulfilled all our hopes. Now, O\nemperor over all, permit us to depart to our own homes, and bestow thy\nblessing upon us."\n\nSo one by one they took leave of Yudhishthira and went away, and the four\nPandavas accompanied the greatest of them to the confines of their kingdoms.\nKrishna was the last to bid farewell.\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "Unto thee I owe all things. Because thou wert here, O\nvalorous one, I was able to perform the great sacrifice."\n\nKrishna said: "Monarch of all! rule thou over thy people with a father\'s\nwisdom and care. Be unto them like rain which nourisheth the parched fields;\nbe a shade in hot sunshine; be a cloudless heaven bending over all. Be thou\never free from pride and passion; ever rule with power and justice and\nholiness, O Yudhishthira."\n\nSo he spake from his chariot and then went his way, and Yudhishthira turned\nhomeward with tear-dimmed eyes.\n\nNow when Duryodhana had witnessed the triumph\n\np. 236\n\nof the Pandavas, his heart burned with jealous rage. He envied the splendour\nof the palaces at Indra-prastha; he envied the glory achieved by Yudhishthira.\nWell he knew that he could not overcome the Pandavas in open conflict, so he\nplotted with his brethren to accomplish their fall by artifice and by wrong.\n\nAs in after-time the wise Sanjaya said: "The gods first deprive of his reason\nthat man unto whom they ultimately send disgrace and defeat".\n\nBut Duryodhana had to work the will of the Creator under the influence of\nfate, and it was doomed that the Pandavas should suffer for a time at his\nhands.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[225:1](iml19.htm#fr_246) _Pron_. indra-prast\xc2\xb4ha.\n\n[226:1](iml19.htm#fr_247) In Ganjam district, Madras.\n\n[226:2](iml19.htm#fr_248) _Pron_. pra-bha\xc2\xb4sa.\n\n[227:1](iml19.htm#fr_249) _Pron_. soo-bhad\xc2\xb4ra.\n\n[227:2](iml19.htm#fr_250) Krishna\'s father, Vasudeva, was the brother of\nPritha, mother of Arjuna.\n\n[228:1](iml19.htm#fr_251) _Pron_. ab-hi-mun\xc2\xb4yoo ("u" as in "bun").\n\n[229:1](iml19.htm#fr_252) In one of the Egyptian temple chants Osiris is\ncalled "the progeny of the two cows Isis and Nepthys".\n\n[229:2](iml19.htm#fr_253) Like the European household elves and fairies.\n\n[229:3](iml19.htm#fr_254) _Pron_. ja-ra-sund\xc2\xb4ha.\n\n[231:1](iml19.htm#fr_255) That is, in Northern India.\n\n[232:1](iml19.htm#fr_256) _Pron_. sish-oo-pah\xc2\xb4la.\n\n[232:2](iml19.htm#fr_257) _Pron_. chay\xc2\xb4dee.\n\n[232:3](iml19.htm#fr_258) A gift of fruit or flowers, like an offering to the\nimage of a god.\n\n[234:1](iml19.htm#fr_259) Krishna represented the worshippers of Vishnu, of\nwhom he was an incarnation.
