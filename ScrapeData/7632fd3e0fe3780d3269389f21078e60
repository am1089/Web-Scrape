S\xc2\x92ri Narada said :-- In the twinkling of an eye of the Devi, the Pralaya\ntakes place; and in that very time also the Brahma _nd_ a (cosmos) is\ndissolved, which is called the Pralaya of Prakriti. During this Pralaya, the\nDevi Vasundhara (Earth) disappears; the whole world is deluged with water and\nall this appearance of five elements called Prapa\xc3\xb1cha vanishes in the body of\nPrakriti. Now where does Vasundhara (Earth), thus vanished, reside? And how\ndoes She again appear at the beginning of the creation! What is the cause of\nher being so much blessed, honoured and capable to hold all and victorious. So\ntell about Her birth, the source of all welfare.\n\n\n\n5-23. S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! So it is heard that the Earth\nappears at the very outset of the creation. Her appearance and disappearance\nso occur in all the Pralayas. (This earth) the manifestation of the great\nS\xc2\x92akti, sometimes becomes manifest in Her and sometimes remains latent in Her\n(the S\xc2\x92akti). It is all the will of that Great S\xc2\x92akti. Now hear the anecdote\nof appearance (birth) of the earth, the cause of all good, the source of\ndestruction of all calamities, the destroyer of sin and the cause of\nfurtherance of one's religious merits. Some say that this earth has come out\nof the marrow of the Daityas, Madhu and Kai _t_ abha; but that is not the\nfact. Hear now the real fact. Those two Daityas were greatly pleased with Vi\n_sn_ u's valour and prowess in the fight between them and Vi _sn_ u; and they\nsaid :-- \xc2\x93Kill us on that part of the earth which is not under water.\xc2\x94 From\ntheir words it is evident that the earth was existent during their lifetime\nbut she was not visible. After their death, the marrow came out after their\nbones. Now hear how the name \xc2\x93Medini\xc2\x94 came to be applied to the earth. She was\ntaken out of the water, and the marrow came to be mixed with the earth. It is\non account of this mixing that she is called Medini, Now I will tell you what\nI heard before in Pu _s_ kara, the sacred place of pilgrimage, from the mouth\nof Dharma Deva, about the origin of earth, approved by the S'rutis,\nconsistent, and good. Hear. When the mind of Maha Vira _t_ , merged in water,\nexpanded all over his body, it entered into every pore of his body. Next the\nMahaprithvi or the Great Earth appeared at the time of Pa\xc3\xb1chi Kara _n_ a\n(mixing of one-half of each of the elements with one-eighth of each of the\nother four elements). This Mahaprithvi was broken into pieces and placed in\nevery pore. It is this differentiated earth that appears during creation and\ndisappears during Pralaya. From this mind, concentrated in every pore of the\nbody\n\n\n\np. 841\n\n\n\nof Maha Vira _t_ , is born this earth, after a long interval. In every pore in\nthe skin of this Vira _t_ Puru _s_ a there is one earth. She gets manifested\nand she disappears. This occurs again and again. When she appears, she floats\non the water; and when she disappears, she gets merged in the water. There is\nthis earth (world) in every universe; and along with her, there are mountains,\nforests, seven oceans, seven islands, Sumeru mountain, the Moon, the Sun and\nother planets, Brahmaloka, Vis _nu_ loka (the abode of Vi _sn_ u) S'ivaloka\nand the regions of the other Devas, sacred places of pilgrimage, the holy land\nof Bharatavar _s_ a, the Kanchani Bhumi, seven heavens, seven Patalas or\nnether regions, on the above Brahmaloka, and Dhruvaloka. This law holds good\nin every world in every universe. So every universe is the work of Maya and\nthus it is transient. At the dissolution of Prakriti, Brahma falls. Again when\ncreation takes place, the Maha Virat appears from S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Supreme\nSpirit. Eternal is this flow of creation, preservation and destruction;\neternal is this flow of time, Ka _st_ ha; eternal is this flow of Brahma, Vi\n_sn_ u and Mahes'a, etc. And eternal is this flow of Vasundhara who is\nworshipped in the Varaha Kalpa by the Suras, Munis, Vipras, Gandarbhas, etc.\nThe S'ruti says that the Presiding Deity of this eternal earth is the wife of\nVi _sn_ u in His boar-form. Mangala (Mars) is the son of that earth and\nMangala's son is Gha _t_ es'a.\n\n\n\n24-26. Narada said :-- In what form was the Earth worshipped by the Devas in\nVaraha Kalpa. The Varahi, the receptacle of all things, moving and non-moving,\nhow did she appear, by what method of Pa\xc3\xb1chi Kara _n_ a, from the\nMulaprakriti? What is the method of her worship in this Bhurloka and in the\nHeavens (Svarloka). Also tell me, O Lord! in detail, the auspicious birth of\nMangala (Mars).\n\n\n\n27-34. Naraya _n_ a spoke :-- In ancient days, in the Varaha Kalpa, Varaha\nDeva (the boar incarnation) when entreated and praised by Brahma, killed the\nDaitya Hira _n_ yak _s_ a and rescued the earth from the nether regions\nRasatala. He then placed the earth on the waters where she floated as the\nlotus leaf floats on water. In the meantime Brahma began to fashion the\nwonderful creation on the surface of the earth. Bhagavan Hari, in His boar\nform and brilliant like ten million suns saw the beautiful and lovely\nappearance of the presiding deity of the earth, possessed of amorous\nsentiments. He then assumed a very beautiful form, fit for amorous embraces.\nThey then held their sexual intercourse and it lasted day and night for one\nDeva year. The beautiful Earth, in the pleasant amorous plays, fainted away;\nfor the intercourse of the lover with the beloved is exceedingly pleasant. And\nVi _sn_ u, too, at the same time was very much exhausted by the pleasant touch\nof the\n\n\n\np. 842\n\n\n\nbody of the Earth. He did not become conscious even how days and nights passed\naway. When full one year passed away, they got back their senses and the\namorous man then left his hold of the loved. He assumed easily his former Boar\nform and worshipped Her as the incarnate of the Devi, with incense, lights,\nofferings of food, with vermilion (Sindur, red-powder), sandal-paste,\ngarments, flowers and various other offerings of food, etc. He then said :--\n\n\n\n35-37. O Auspicious One! Let Thou beest the receptacle of all things. All the\nMunis, Manus, Devas, Siddhas, and Danavas, etc., will worship Thee with\npleasure and willingness. On the day the Ambuvachi ceremony closes, on the day\nwhen the house construction, i.e., the foundation is laid, on the day when the\nfirst entry is made into the newly built houses, when the digging of the well\nor tank commences, and on the day when tilling the ground commences, all will\nworship Thee. Those stupid fools that will not observe this, will certainly go\nto hell.\n\n\n\n38-41 The Earth spoke :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! By Thy command I will assume the form of\nVarahi (female boar) and support easily on my back this whole world of moving\nand non-moving things, but the following things, pearls, small shells,\nS'alagram, (a black stone, usually round, found in the river Gan _d_ aki, and\nworshipped as a type of Vi _sn_ u), the phallus or emblem of S'iva, the images\nof the goddesses, conch-shells, lamps (lights), the Yantras, gems, diamonds,\nthe sacred upanayana threads, flowers, books, the Tulasi leaves, the bead\n(Japa mala), the garland of flowers, gold, camphor, Gorochana (bright yellow\npigment prepared from the urine or bile of a cow), Sandal, and the water after\nwashing the S'alagrama stone, I will not be able to bear. I will be very much\npained in case I were to bear these on Me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n42-45. S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan said :-- \xc2\x93O Fair One! The fools that will place the above\narticles on Thy back will go to the Kalasutra hell for one hundred divine\nyears.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Thus saying, the Bhagavan Naraya _n_ a remained silent. Now\nthe Earth became pregnant and the powerful planet Mars was born. By the\ncommand of S\xc2\x92ri Hari, all began to meditate on Earth according to what is\nmentioned in Ka _n_ vas'akha and began to praise Her. Offerings of food were\ngiven, uttering the root Mantra. Thus became extant all over the three worlds\nHer worship and praise.\n\n\n\n46\\. Narada said :-- O Bhagavan! Very sacred is the meditation, hymn and the\nroot Mantra of the Earth. I am very anxious to hear them. Kindly describe it\nin detail.\n\n\n\n47-48. Naraya _n_ a said :-- The Earth was first worshipped by Varaha Deva;\nnext She was worshipped by Brahma. Next She was worshipped by all the Munis,\nDevas, Manus and men. O Narada! Now hear the Dhyan, praise and Mantra of the\nDevi Earth.\n\n\n\np. 843\n\n\n\n49-51. The Earth was first worshipped by Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u with this root\nMantra (mul mantra) \xc2\x93On Hrim S\xc2\x92rim Klim Vasundharayai Svaha.\xc2\x94 Next He said :--\nO Devi Earth! O Thou Smiling One! I worship Thee, who art worshipped by the\nthree worlds, whose colour is white like white lotus, whose face is beautiful\nlike the autumnal moon, who art the Store-house of all gems and jewels, and in\nwhose womb all the precious stones and pearls are inbedded, and who has put on\na raiment purified by fire. All then began to worship Her with this Mantra.\n\n\n\n52-63. S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a said :-- Now hear the hymn sung before Her according\nto Ka _n_ va S'akha :-- O Thou, the Giver of Victory! Holder of water! Endowed\nwith water, full of victory; Consort of the Boar Incarnation, Carrier of\nvictory! Bestow victory on me. O Thou Auspicious One! The Store-house of all\ngood, O Thou incarnate of all auspiciousness! Bestower of good, Thou, the\nSource of all good to bestow all sorts of welfare! Bestow all things that are\ngood and auspicious to me in this world.\n\n\n\nO Thou! The Receptacle of all, the Knower of all, all powerful, the Bestower\nof all desires, O Devi Earth! Give me the fruits that I desire.\n\n\n\nO Thou! Who art all merits, Thou, the Seed of all religious merits, O Thou,\nthe Eternal, the receptacle of all religious merits, the home of all religious\npersons, Thou bestowest merits to all.\n\n\n\nO Thou! The Store-house of all grains, enriched with all sorts of corns, Thou\nbestowest harvests to all; Thou takest away all the grains in this world and\nagain, Thou producest all corns of various kinds here. O Earth! Thou art all-\nin-all to the landlords, the Best Source of refuge and happiness. O Bestower\nof lands! Give me lands. The above hymn yields great religious merits. He\nbecomes the sovereign of the whole earth for millions and millions of births\nwho rising early in the morning reads this stotra. Men who read this acquire\nmerits due to giving away lands as gifts. People become certainly freed of\ntheir sins, if they read this stotra, who take back the lands after making\nthem as gifts, who dig earth on the day of Ambuvachi, who dig wells without\npermission on another's well, who steal other's lands, who throw their semen\non earth, who place lamps on the earth. Religious merits, equivalent to one\nhundred horse sacrifices accrue from reading this stotra. There is no doubt in\nthis. This stotra of the great Devi is the source of all sorts of welfare and\nauspiciousness.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Ninth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the origin of the S\xc2\x92akti of\nthe earth in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 10](bk09ch10.htm)\n\n"
