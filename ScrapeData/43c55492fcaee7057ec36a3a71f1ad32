But on account of their distinctive nature there is a (distinctive)\ndesignation of them.\n\nThe word 'but' repels the objection raised. By 'distinctive nature' we have to\nunderstand preponderance. Although all things are tripartite, yet we observe\nin different places a preponderance of different elements; heat preponderates\nin fire, water in all that is liquid, food in earth. This special tripartition\naims at rendering possible the distinctions and terms of ordinary life. For if\nthe tripartition resulted in sameness, comparable to that of the three strands\nof a tripartite rope, we could not distinguish--and speak of as distinguished\n--the three elements.--Hence,\n\np. 100\n\nalthough there is a tripartition, we are enabled 'on account of distinctive\nnature' to give special designations to the three elements, viz. fire, water,\nand earth and their products.--The repetition (of 'designation of them')\nindicates the termination of the adhyaya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 1](sbe38077.htm)\n\n"
