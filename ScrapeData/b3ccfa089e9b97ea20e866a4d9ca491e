There is (restriction to) option (between the vidyas), on account of\ntheir having non-differing results.\n\nThe difference of the vidyas having been determined, we now enter on an\ninquiry whether, according to one's liking, there should be cumulation of the\ndifferent vidyas or option between them; or else restriction to an optional\nproceeding (to the exclusion of cumulation). For restriction to cumulation\n(which might be mentioned as a third alternative) there is no reason, because\nthe separation of the vidyas has been established.--But we observe that in the\ncase of the sacrifices, agnihotra, dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa and so on, there is\nrestriction to cumulation (i.e. that those sacrifices have all of them to be\nperformed, not optionally one or the Other) although they are different from\neach other.--True; but the reason for the obligatory cumulation of those\nsacrifices lies therein that scripture teaches them to be of absolute\nobligation. No scriptural passage, on the other hand, teaches the absolute\nobligatoriness of the vidyas, and it cannot therefore be a rule that they must\nbe cumulated.--Nor can it be a rule that there must be option between them,\nbecause a person entitled to one vidya cannot be excluded from another vidya.\nIt therefore only remains to conclude that one may proceed as one likes.--But\n--an objection is raised--we must rather conclude that option between them is\nthe rule, because their fruits are non-different. For vidyas such as 'He who\nconsists of mind, whose body is pra _n_ a;' 'Brahman is Ka, Brahman is Kha;'\n'He whose wishes are true, whose purposes are true,' have all of them equally\nthe obtaining of the Lord for their fruit.--This does not affect our\nconclusion; for we see that it is allowed to proceed as one likes also with\nregard to certain sacrificial acts which are the means of obtaining the\nheavenly world, and thus have all of them the same result. It therefore\nremains a settled conclusion that in the case of vidyas one may proceed as one\nlikes.\n\nTo this we reply as follows. There must be option between the vidyas, not\ncumulation, because they have the\n\np. 281\n\nsame fruit. For the fruit of all of them is the intuition of the object\nmeditated upon, and when this object, e.g. the Lord, has once been intuited\nthrough one meditation a second meditation would be purposeless. It would,\nmoreover, be impossible even to effect an intuition through the cumulation of\nseveral meditations, since that would cause distraction of attention. And that\nthe fruit of a vidya is to be effected through intuition various scriptural\npassages declare; cp. _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 4, 'He who has this faith and no\ndoubt;' B _ri_. Up. IV, i, 3, 'Having become a god he goes to the gods,' and\nothers. Also Sm _ri_ ti-passages such as Bha. Gita VIII, 6, and others.--One\ntherefore has to select one of those vidyas the fruit of which is the same,\nand to remain intent on it until, through the intuition of the object to be\nmeditated upon, the fruit of the vidya is obtained.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 60](sbe38203.htm)\n\n"
