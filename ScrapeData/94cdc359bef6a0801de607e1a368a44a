VIII.\n\nConclusion of the dialogue between Para\xc5\x9bara and Maitreya. Recapitulation of\nthe contents of the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a: merit of hearing it: how handed down.\nPraises of Vishn\xcc\x81u. Concluding prayer.\n\nI HAVE now explained to you, Maitreya, the third kind of worldly dissolution,\nor that which is absolute and final, which is, liberation and resolution into\neternal spirit 1. I have related to you primary and secondary creation, the\nfamilies of the patriarchs, the periods of the Manwantaras, and the\ngenealogical histories (of the kings). I have repeated to you, in short, who\nwere desirous of hearing it, the imperishable Vaishn\xcc\x81ava Puran\xcc\x81a, which is\ndestructive of all sins, the most excellent of all holy writings, and the\nmeans of attaining the great end of man. If there is any thing else you wish\nto hear, propose your question, and I will answer it.\n\nMAITREYA.--Holy teacher, you have indeed related to me all that I wished to\nknow, and I have listened to it with pious attention. I have nothing further\nto inquire. The doubts inseparable from the mind of man have all been resolved\nby you, and through your instructions I am acquainted with the origin,\nduration, and end of all things; with Vishn\xcc\x81u in his collective fourfold form\n2; his three energies 3; and with the three modes of apprehending the object\nof contemplation 4. Of all this have I acquired a knowledge through your\nfavour, and nothing else is worthy to be known, when it is once understood\nthat Vishn\xcc\x81u and this world are not mutually distinct. Great Muni, I have\nobtained through your kindness all I desired, the dissipation of my doubts,\nsince you have instructed me\n\np. 661\n\nin the duties of the several tribes, and in other obligations; the nature of\nactive life, and discontinuance of action; and the derivation of all that\nexists from works. There is nothing else, venerable Brahman, that I have to\ninquire of you; and forgive me if your answers to my questions have imposed\nupon you any fatigue. Pardon me the trouble that I have given you, through\nthat amiable quality of the virtuous -which makes no distinction between a\ndisciple and a child.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--I have related to you this Puran\xcc\x81a, which is equal to the Vedas in\nsanctity, and by hearing which all faults and sins whatever are expiated. In\nthis have been described to you the primary and secondary creation, the\nfamilies of the patriarchs, the Manwantaras, the regal dynasties; the gods,\nDaityas, Gandharbas, serpents, Rakshasas, Yakshas, Vidyadharas, Siddhas, and\nheavenly nymphs; Munis endowed with spiritual wisdom, and practisers of\ndevotion; the distinctions of the four castes, and the actions of the most\neminent amongst men; holy places on the earth, holy rivers and oceans, sacred\nmountains, and legends of the truly wise; the duties of the different tribes,\nand the observances enjoined by the Vedas. By hearing this, all sins are at\nonce obliterated. In this also the glorious Hari has been revealed, the cause\nof the creation, preservation, and destruction of the world; the soul of all\nthings, and himself all things: by the repetition of whose name man is\nundoubtedly liberated from all sins, which fly like wolves that are frightened\nby a lion. The repetition of his name with devout faith is the best remover of\nall sins, destroying them as fire purifies the metal from the dross. The stain\nof the Kali age, which ensures to men sharp punishments in hell, is at once\neffaced by a single invocation of Hari. He who is all that is, the whole egg\nof Brahma, with Hiran\xcc\x81yagarbha, Indra, Rudra, the \xc3\x81dityas, the Aswins, the\nwinds, the Kinnaras, the Vasus, the Sadhyas, Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas, the celestial gods,\nthe Yakshas, serpents, Rakshasas, the Siddhas, Daityas, Gandharbas, Danavas,\nnymphs, the stars, asterisms, planets, the seven Rishis, the regents and\nsuperintendants of the quarters, men, Brahmans and the rest, animals tame and\nwild, insects, birds, ghosts and goblins, trees, mountains, woods, rivers,\noceans, the subterrene legions, the divisions of the earth, and all\nperceptible objects--he who is all things, who\n\np. 662\n\nknoweth all things, who is the form of all things, being without form himself,\nand of whom whatever is, from mount Meru to an atom, all consists--he, the\nglorious Vishn\xcc\x81u, the destroyer of all sin--is described in this Puran\xcc\x81a. By\nhearing this Puran\xcc\x81a an equal recompense is obtained to that which is derived\nfrom the performance of an A\xc5\x9bwamedha sacrifice, or from fasting at the holy\nplaces Prayaga, Pushkara, Kurukshetra, or Arbuda. Hearing this Puran\xcc\x81a but\nonce is as efficacious as the offering of oblations in a perpetual fire for a\nyear. The man who with well-governed passions bathes at Mathura on the twelfth\nday of the month Jyesht\xcc\x81ha 5, and beholds (the image of) Hari, obtains a great\nrecompense; so does he who with mind fixed upon Ke\xc5\x9bava attentively recites\nthis Puran\xcc\x81a. The man who bathes in the waters of the Yamuna on the twelfth\nlunation of the light fortnight of the month in which the moon is in the\nmansion Jyesht\xcc\x81ha, and who fasts and worships Achyuta in the city of Mathura,\nreceives the reward of an uninterrupted A\xc5\x9bwamedha. Beholding the degree of\nprosperity enjoyed by others of eminence, through the merits of their\ndescendants, a man\'s paternal ancestors, his parents and their parents,\nexclaim, "Whosoever of our descendants, having bathed in the Yamuna and\nfasted, will worship Govinda in Mathura, in the light fortnight of Jyesht\xcc\x81ha,\nwill secure for us eminent exaltation; for we shall be elevated by the merits\nof our posterity!" A man of good extraction will present obsequial cakes to\nhis fortunate ancestors in the Yamuna, having worshipped Janarddana in the\nlight fortnight of Jyesht\xcc\x81ha. But the same degree of merit that a man reaps\nfront adoring Janarddana at that season with a devoted heart, and from bathing\nin the Yamuna, and effecting the liberation of his progenitors by offering to\nthem on such an occasion obsequial cakes, he derives also from hearing with\nequal devotion a section of this Puran\xcc\x81a. This Puran\xcc\x81a is the best of all\npreservatives for those who are afraid of worldly existence,\n\np. 663\n\na certain alleviation of the sufferings of men, and remover of all\nimperfections.\n\nThis Puran\xcc\x81a, originally composed by the Rishi (Narayan\xcc\x81a), was communicated\nby Brahma to Ribhu; he related it to Priyavrata, by whom it was imparted to\nBhaguri. Bhaguri recited it to Tamasitra 6, and he to Dadicha, who gave it to\nSaraswata. From the last Bhrigu received it, who imparted it to Purukutsa, and\nhe taught it to Narmada. The goddess delivered it to Dhritarasht\xcc\x81ra the Naga\nking, and to Puran\xcc\x81a of the same race, by whom it was repeated to their\nmonarch Vasuki. Vasuki communicated it to Vatsa, and he to \xc3\x81swatara, from whom\nit successively proceeded to Kambala and Elapatra. When the Muni Veda\xc5\x9biras\ndescended to Patala, he there received the whole Puran\xcc\x81a from these Nagas, and\ncommunicated it to Pramati. Pramati consigned it to the wise Jatukarn\xcc\x81a, and\nhe taught it to many other holy persons. Through the blessing of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha it\ncame to my knowledge, and I have now, Maitreya, faithfully imparted it to you.\nYou will teach it, at the end of the Kali age, to \xc5\x9aamika 7. Whoever hears this\ngreat mystery, which removes the contamination of the Kali, shall be freed\nfrom all his sins. He who hears this every day acquits himself of his daily\nobligations to ancestors, gods, and men. The great and rarely attainable merit\nthat a man acquires by the gift of a brown cow, he derives from hearing ten\nchapters of this Puran\xcc\x81a 8. He who hears the entire Puran\xcc\x81a, contemplating in\nhis mind Achyuta, who is all things, and of whom all things are made; who is\nthe stay of the whole world, the receptacle of spirit; who is knowledge, and\nthat which is to be known; who is without beginning or end, and the benefactor\nof the gods--obtains assuredly the reward that attends the uninterrupted\ncelebration of the A\xc5\x9bwamedha rite. He who reads and retains with faith this\nPuran\xcc\x81a,\n\np. 664\n\nin the beginning, middle, and end of which is described the glorious Achyuta,\nthe lord of the universe in every stage, the master of all that is stationary\nor moveable, composed of spiritual knowledge, acquires such purity as exists\nnot in any world, the eternal state of perfection, which is Hari. The man who\nfixes his mind on Vishn\xcc\x81u goes not to hell: he who meditates upon him regards\nheavenly enjoyment only as an impediment: and he whose mind and soul are\npenetrated by him thinks little of the world of Brahma; for when present in\nthe minds of those whose intellects are free from soil, he confers upon them\neternal freedom. What marvel therefore is it that the sins of one who repeats\nthe name of Achyuta should be wiped away? Should not that Hari be heard of,\nwhom those devoted to acts worship with sacrifices continually as the god of\nsacrifice; whom those devoted to meditation contemplate as primary and\nsecondary, composed of spirit; by obtaining whom man is not born, nor\nnourished, nor subjected to death; who is all that is, and that is not (or\nboth cause and of effect); who, as the progenitors, receives the libations\nmade to them; who, as the gods, accepts the offerings addressed to them; the\nglorious being who is without beginning or end; whose name is both Swaha and\nSwadha 9; who is the abode of all spiritual power; in whom the limits of\nfinite things cannot be measured 10; and who, when he enters the ear, destroys\nall sin?\n\nI adore him, that first of gods, Purushottama, who is without end and without\nbeginning, without growth, without decay, without death; who is substance that\nknows not change. I adore that ever inexhaustible spirit; who assumed sensible\nqualities; who, though one, became many; who, though pure, became as if\nimpure, by appearing in many and various shapes; who is endowed with divine\nwisdom, and is the author of the preservation of all creatures. I adore him,\nwho is the one conjoined essence and object of both meditative wisdom and\nactive virtue;\n\np. 665\n\nwho is watchful in providing for human enjoyments; who is one with the three\nqualities; who, without undergoing change, is the cause of the evolution of\nthe world; who exists of his own essence, ever exempt from decay. I constantly\nadore him, who is entitled heaven, air, fire, water, earth, and ether; who is\nthe bestower of all the objects which give gratification to the senses; who\nbenefits mankind with the instruments of fruition; who is perceptible, who is\nsubtile, who is imperceptible. May that unborn, eternal Hari, whose form is\nmanifold, and whose essence is composed of both nature and spirit, bestow upon\nall mankind that blessed state which knows neither birth nor decay!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[660:1](vp163.htm#fr_1660) The term is Brahman\xcc\x81i laya, which means, \'a melting\naway,\' \'a dissolution\' or \'fusion,\' from the root, \'to liquefy,\' \'to melt,\'\n\'to dissolve.\'\n\n[660:2](vp163.htm#fr_1661) Or with Vishn\xcc\x81u in the four modifications described\nin the first section, spirit, matter, form, and time: see [p.\n9](vp036.htm#page_9).\n\n[660:3](vp163.htm#fr_1662) Or \xc5\x9aakti, noticed in the last chapter, [p.\n655](vp162.htm#page_655).\n\n[660:4](vp163.htm#fr_1663) Or Bhavanas, also described in the preceding\nsection, [p. 654](vp162.htm#page_654).\n\n[662:5](vp163.htm#fr_1664) This month is also called Jyesht\xcc\x81hamula, which the\ncommentator explains to mean, the month, of which the root or cause (Mula) of\nbeing so called is the moon\'s being full in the constellation Jyesht\xcc\x81ha: but\nit may be so termed, perhaps, from the lunar asterism Mula, which is next to\nJyesht\xcc\x81ha, falling also within the moon\'s passage through the same month.\n\n[663:6](vp163.htm#fr_1665) This name is also read Tambamitra. One copy has\nTava-mitraya, \'to thy friend,\' as if it was an epithet of Dadhicha; but the\nconstruction of the verse requires a proper name. \'Bhaguri gave it to\nTambamitra, and he to Dadhichi.\'\n\n[663:7](vp163.htm#fr_1666) A different series of narrators has been specified\nin the first book, [p. 9](vp036.htm#page_9).\n\n[663:8](vp163.htm#fr_1667) This seems to be an injudicious interpolation; it\nis not in all the copies.\n\n[664:9](vp163.htm#fr_1668) The words or prayers employed in presenting\noblations with fire.\n\n[664:10](vp163.htm#fr_1669) The text has, ###.
