Now it chanced\nthat in this river there lived a great big Alligator, who, being also very\nhungry, would have been extremely glad to eat the Jackal.\n\nThe Jackal ran up and down, here and there, but for a long time could find\nnothing to eat. At last, close to where the Alligator was lying, among some\ntall buirushes under the clear shallow water, he saw a little crab sidling\nalong as fast as his legs could carry him. The Jackal was so hungry that when\nhe saw this, be poked his paw into the water to try and catch the crab, when\nSNAP 1 the old Alligator caught hold of him. 'Oh dear 1' thought the Jackal to\nhimself; 'what can r do? this great big Alligator has caught my paw in his\nmouth, and in another minute he will drag me down by it under the water and\nkill me. My only chance is to make him think he has made a mistake.' So he\ncalled out in a cheerful voice, 'Clever Alligator, clever Alligator, to catch\nhold of a bulrush root instead of my paw I I hope you find it very tender.'\nThe Alligator, who was so buried among the bulrushes that he could hardly see,\nthought, on hearing this, 'Dear me, how tiresome I I fancied I had caught hold\nof the Jackal's paw; but there he is, calling out in a cheerful voice; I\nsuppose I must have seized a bulrush root instead, as he says.' And he let the\nJackal go.\n\nThe Jackal ran away as fast as he could, crying, 'O wise Alligator, wise\nAlligator! So you let me go again!' Then the Alligator was very vexed, but the\nJackal had run away too far to be caught. Next day the Jackal returned to the\nriver-side to get his dinner, as before; but because he was very much afraid\nof the Alligator, he called out, 'Whenever I go to look for my dinner, I see\nthe nice little crabs peeping up through the mud, then I catch them and eat\nthem. I wish I could see one now.'\n\nThe Alligator, who was buried in the mud at the bottom of the river, heard\nevery word. So he popped the little point of his snout above the water,\nthinking, 'If I do but just show the tip of my nose, the Jackal will take me\nfor a crab and put in his paw to catch me, and as soon as ever he does I 'll\ngobble him up.'\n\nBut no sooner did the Jackal see the little tip of the Alligator's nose than\nhe called out, 'Aha, my friend, there you are! No dinner for me in this part\nof the river then, I think.' And so saying he ran further on, and fished for\nhis dinner a long way from that place. The Alligator was very angry at missing\nhis prey a second time, and determined not to let him escape again.\n\nSo on the following day, when his little tormentor returned to the water-side,\nthe Alligator hid himself close to the bank, in order to catch him if he\ncould. Now the Jackal was rather afraid of going near the river, for he\nthought, 'Perhaps this Alligator will catch me to-day.' But yet, being hungry,\nhe did not wish to go without his dinner; so to make all as safe as he could,\nhe cried, 'Where are all the little crabs gone? There is not one here, and I\nam so hungry; and generally, even when they are under water, one can see them\ngoing bubble, bubble, bubble, and all the little bubbles go pop! pop! pop t'\nOn hearing this the Alligator, who was buried in the mud under the river-bank,\nthought, 'I will pretend to be a little crab.' And he began to blow, 'Puff\npuff puff! Bubble, bubble, bubble!' and all the great big bubbles rushed to\nthe surface of the river and burst there, and the waters eddied round and\nround like a whirlpool; and there was such a commotion when the huge monster\nbegan to blow bubbles in this way, that the Jackal saw very well who must be\nthere, and he ran away as fast as he could, saying, 'Thank you, kind\nAlligator, thank you; thank you. Indeed, I would not have come here had I\nknown you were so close.'\n\nThis enraged the Alligator extremely; it made him quite cross to think of\nbeing so often deceived by a little Jackal, and he said to himself, 'I will be\ntaken in no more. Next time I will be very cunning.' So for a long time he\nwaited and waited for the Jackal to return to the river-side; but the Jackal\ndid not come, for he had thought to himself, 'If matters go on in this way, I\nshall some day be caught, and eaten by the wicked old Alligator. I had better\ncontent myself with living on wild figs,' and he went no more near the river,\nbut stayed in the jungles and ate wild figs, and roots which he dug up with\nhis paws.\n\nWhen the Alligator found this out, he determined to try and catch the Jackal\non land; so, going under the largest of the wild fig-trees, where the ground\nwas covered with the fallen fruit, he collected a quantity of it together,\nand, burying himself under the great heap, waited for the Jackal to appear.\nBut no sooner did the Jackal see this great heap of wild figs all collected\ntogether, than he thought, 'That looks very like my friend the Alligator.' And\nto discover if it was so or not he called out, 'The juicy little wild figs I\nlove to eat always tumble down from the tree, and roll here and there as the\nwind drives them; but this great heap of figs is quite still; these cannot be\ngood figs, I will not eat any of them.'--' Ho-ho!' thought the Alligator, 'is\nthat all? How suspicious this Jackal is! I will make the figs roll about a\nlittle then, and when he sees that he will doubtless come and eat them.'\n\nSo the great beast shook himself, and all the heap of little figs went roll,\nroll, roll; some a mile this way, some a mile that, further than they had ever\nrolled before, or than the most blustering wind could have driven them!\n\nSeeing this the Jackal scampered away, saying, 'I am so much obliged to you,\nAlligator, for letting me know you are there, for indeed I should hardly have\nguessed it. You were so buried under that heap of figs.' The Alligator hearing\nthis was so angry that he ran after the Jackal, but the latter ran very, very\nfast away too quickly to be caught.\n\nThen the Alligator said to himself, 'I will not allow that little wretch to\nmake fun of me another time, and then run away out of reach; I will show him\nthat I can be more cunning than he fancies.' And early the next morning he\ncrawled as fast as he could to the Jackal's den (which was a hole in the side\nof a hill) and crept into it, and hid himself, waiting for the Jackal, who was\nout, to return home. But when the Jackal got near the place he looked about\nhim and thought, 'Dear me, the ground looks as if some heavy creature had been\nwalking over it, and here are great clods of earth knocked down from each side\nof the door of my den as if a very big animal had been trying to squeeze\nhimself through it. I certainly will not go inside until I know that all is\nsafe there. So he called out, 'Little house, pretty house, my sweet little\nhouse, why do von not give an answer when I call? If I come and all is safe\nand right, you always call out to me. Is anything wrong, that you do not\nspeak?'\n\nThen the Alligator, who was inside, thought, 'If that is the case I had better\ncall out, that he may fancy all is right in his house.' And in as gentle a\nvoice as he could, he said, 'Sweet little Jackal'\n\nAt hearing these words the Jackal felt quite frightened, and thought to\nhimself; 'So the dreadful old Alligator is there! I must try to kill him if I\ncan, for if I do not he will certainly catch and kill me some day.' He\ntherefore answered, 'Thank you, my dear little house. I like to hear your\npretty voice. I am coming in in a minute, but first I must collect firewood to\ncook my dinner.' And he ran as fast as he could, and dragged all the dry\nbranches and bits of stick he could find close up to the mouth of the den.\nMeantime the Alligator inside kept as quiet as a mouse, but he could not help\nlaughing a little to himself; as he thought, 'So I have deceived this tiresome\nlittle Jackal at last. In a few minutes he will run in here, and then won't I\nsnap him up!' When the Jackal had gathered together all the sticks he could\nfind, and put them round the mouth of his den, he set them alight and pushed\nthem as far into it as possible. There was such a quantity of them that they\nsoon blazed up into a great fire, and the smoke and flames filled the den and\nsmothered the wicked old Alligator, and burnt him to death, while the little\nJackal ran up and down outside, dancing for joy and singing-- 'How do you like\nmy house, my friend? Is it nice and warm?\n\nDing, dong! ding, dong! The Alligator is dying! ding, dong! ding, dong!\n\n'He will trouble me no more. I have defeated my enemy! Ring a ting! ding a\nting! ding, ding, dong!'\n\n![](img/50.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Notes on the Narrator's Narrative](odd29.htm)\n\n"
