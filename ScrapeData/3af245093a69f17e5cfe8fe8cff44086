In (a nature like) that of Brahman, thus _G_ aimini thinks; on account of\nsuggestion and the rest.\n\np. 760\n\nOwing to the fact that different texts give different accounts, the question\nnow arises of what character that essential nature of the Self is in which it\nmanifests itself on reaching Brahman. Is that nature constituted by freedom\nfrom evil and sin and the rest (i.e. the attributes enumerated _Kh_. Up. VIII,\n7, 1); or by mere intelligence (vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana); or by both, there being no\nopposition between intelligence and those other attributes?--The teacher _G_\naimini holds that the soul manifests itself in its Brahman character, i.e. in\na character constituted by freedom from sin, and so on. These latter\nattributes are, in the text of the 'small lotus,' mentioned as belonging to\nBrahman ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 5), and may hence be referred to as the 'Brahman'\ncharacter. And that this Brahman character is the character of the released\nsoul also follows from 'suggestion and the rest.' For freedom from all evil\nand the rest are, in the teaching of Pra _g_ apati, referred to as attributes\nof the soul (VIII, 7, 1). The 'and the rest' of the Sutra refers to the\nactivities of the released soul--laughing, playing, rejoicing, and so on\n(mentioned in VIII, 12, 3)--which depend on the power belonging to the soul in\nthat state to realise all its ideas and wishes. It is for these reasons that\n_G_ aimini holds that mere intelligence does not constitute the true nature of\nthe released soul.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 6.
