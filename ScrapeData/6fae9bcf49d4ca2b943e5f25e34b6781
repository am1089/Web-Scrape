To which\nBrahma thus replied: "Well asked. Hearken to that which all \xc5\x9aru\xe1\xb9\xadis (the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das)\nkeep secret and hidden, through which one may cross the sams\xc4\x81ra (mundane\nexistence) of Kali. He shakes off (the evil effects of) Kali through the mere\nuttering of the name of the Lord N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, who is the primeval Purusha." Again\nN\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da asked Brahma: "What is the name?" To which Hira\xe1\xb9\x87yagarbha (Brahma)\nreplied thus: (the words are:) "1. Har\xc4\x93, 2. R\xc4\x81ma, 3. Har\xc4\x93, 4. R\xc4\x81ma, 5. R\xc4\x81ma,\n6. R\xc4\x81ma, 7. Har\xc4\x93, 8. Har\xc4\x93; 9. Har\xc4\x93 10\\. K\xe1\xb9\x9bsh\xe1\xb9\x87a, 11. Har\xc4\x93, 12. K\xe1\xb9\x9bsh\xe1\xb9\x87a, 13.\nK\xe1\xb9\x9bsh\xe1\xb9\x87a, 14. K\xe1\xb9\x9bsh\xe1\xb9\x87a 15. Har\xc4\x93, 16. Har\xc4\x93. These sixteen names (words) are\ndestructive of the evil effects of Kali. No better means than this is to be\nseen in all the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. These (sixteen names) destroy the \xc4\x81vara\xe1\xb9\x87a (or the\ncentripetal force which produces the sense of individuality) of j\xc4\xabva\nsurrounded by the sixteen kal\xc4\x81s (rays). Then like the\n\np. 131\n\nsphere of the sun which shines fully after the clouds (screening it) disperse,\nParabrahman (alone) shines."\n\nN\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da asked: "O Lord, what are the rules to be observed with reference to\nit?" To which Brahma replied that there were no rules for it. Whoever in a\npure or an impure state, utters these always, attains the same world of, or\nproximity with, or the same form of, or absorption into Brahma.\n\nWhoever utters three and a half kotis 1 (or thirty-five millions) times this\nman\xe1\xb9\xadra composed of sixteen names (or words) crosses the sin of the murder of a\nBr\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a. He becomes purified from the sin of the theft of gold. He becomes\npurified from the sin of cohabitation with a woman of low caste. He is\npurified from the sins of wrong done to pi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\x9bs, \xe1\xb8\x8devas, and men. Having given up\nall \xe1\xb8\x8dharmas, he becomes freed at once from all sins. He is at once released\nfrom all bondage. That he is at once released from all bondage is the\nUpanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[130:1](tmu21.htm#fr_97) This Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d treats of the means of crossing Kali\ncompletely: N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da having asked the question in \xe1\xb8\x8cv\xc4\x81para yuga--the third of the\nfour yugas.\n\n[130:2](tmu21.htm#fr_98) N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da is called Kali-K\xc4\x81raka or the generator of kali\nor strife and discord. If N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da is himself the strife-maker, why should he go\nto Brahma for the means of crossing Kali? N\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb8\x8da being himself an adjuster of\nthe laws of karma, this Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d gives the means of getting over strife,\netc., in this Kali-age when the whole of nature is thrown off its balance by\nthe depraved tendencies of men. The jive, has sixteen kal\xc4\x81s, corresponding to\nwhich sixteen man\xe1\xb9\xadras or words are given.\n\n[130:3](tmu21.htm#fr_99) The story is that he was cursed by \xe1\xb8\x8caksha to roam\nover the worlds with a lute in his hand ( _viz_., to adjust the laws of\nharmony).\n\n[131:1](tmu21.htm#fr_100) This number can be reached by uttering the man\xe1\xb9\xadra\ncompletely within one year if uttered at the rate of a lakh per day: and\nwithin ten years if uttered at the rate of 10,000 per day; and within 100\nyears if uttered at the rate of 1,000 _per diem_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 20.
