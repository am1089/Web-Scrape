Charm with the plant prisniparni against the demon of disease,\ncalled kanva.\n\n1\\. The goddess Prisniparni has prepared prosperity for us, mishap for Nirriti\n(the goddess of destruction). For she is a fierce devourer of the Kanvas: her,\nthe mighty, have I employed.  \n2\\. The Prisniparni was first begotten powerful; with her do I lop off the\nheads of the evil brood, as (the head) of a bird.  \n3\\. The blood-sucking demon, and him that tries to rob (our) health, Kanva,\nthe devourer of our offspring, destroy, O Prisniparni, and overcome!  \n4\\. These Kanvas, the effacers of life, drive into the mountain; go thou\nburning after them like fire, O goddess Prisniparni!  \n5\\. Drive far away these Kanvas, the effacers of life! Where the dark regions\nare, there have I made these flesh-eaters go.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 32. Charm for driving away demons (Rakshas and Pisakas)](av054.htm)\n\n'
