Having gone to king Prasenajit, he demanded in marriage his daughter\nRen\xcc\x81uka, and the king gave her unto him. The descendant of Bhrigu conducted\nthe princess to his hermitage, and dwelt with her there, and she was contented\nto partake in his ascetic life. They had four sons, and then a fifth, who was\nJamadagnya, the last but not the least of the brethren, Once when her sons\nwere all absent, to gather the fruits on which they fed, Ren\xcc\x81uka, who was\nexact in the discharge of all her duties, went forth to bathe. On her way to\nthe stream she beheld Chitraratha, the prince of Mrittikavati, with a garland\nof lotuses on his neck, sporting with his queen in the water, and she felt\nenvious of their felicity. Defiled by unworthy thoughts, wetted but not\npurified by the stream, she returned disquieted to the hermitage, and her\nhusband perceived her agitation. Beholding her fallen from perfection, and\nshorn of the lustre of her sanctity, Jamadagni reproved her, and was exceeding\nwroth. Upon this there came her sons from the wood, first the eldest,\nRuman\xcc\x81wat, then Sushen\xcc\x81a, then Vasu, and then Vi\xc5\x9bwavasu; and each, as he\nentered, was successively commanded by his father to put his mother to death;\nbut amazed, and influenced by natural affection, neither of them made any\nreply: therefore Jamadagni was angry, and cursed them, and they became as\nidiots, and lost all\n\np. 402\n\nunderstanding, and were like unto beasts or birds. Lastly, Rama returned to\nthe hermitage, when the mighty and holy Jamadagni said unto him, \'Kill thy\nmother, who has sinned; and do it, son, without repining.\' Rama accordingly\ntook up his axe, and struck off his mother\'s head; whereupon the wrath of the\nillustrious and mighty Jamadagni was assuaged, and he was pleased with his\nson, and said, \'Since thou hast obeyed my commands, and done what was hard to\nbe performed, demand from me whatever blessings thou wilt, and thy desires\nshall be all fulfilled.\' Then Rama begged of his father these boons; the\nrestoration of his mother to life, with forgetfulness of her having been\nslain, and purification from all defilement; the return of his brothers to\ntheir natural condition; and, for himself, invincibility in single combat, and\nlength of days: and all these did his father bestow.\n\n"It happened on one occasion, that, during the absence of the Rishi\'s sons,\nthe mighty monarch Karttavirya, the sovereign of the Haihaya tribe, endowed by\nthe favour of Dattatreya with a thousand arms, and a golden chariot that went\nwheresoever he willed it to go, came to the hermitage 16 of Jamadagni, where\nthe wife of the sage received him with all proper respect. The king, inflated\nwith the pride of valour, made no return to her hospitality, but carried off\nwith him by violence the calf of the milch cow of the sacred oblation 17, and\ncast down the tall trees surrounding the hermitage. When Rama returned, his\nfather told him what had chanced, and he saw the cow in affliction, and he was\nfilled with wrath. Taking up his splendid bow 18, Bhargava, the slayer of\nhostile heroes, assailed Karttavirya, who had now become subject to\n\np. 403\n\nthe power of death, and overthrew him in battle. With sharp arrows Rama cut\noff his thousand arms, and the king perished. The sons of Karttavirya, to\nrevenge his death, attacked the hermitage of Jamadagni, when Rama was away,\nand slew the pious and unresisting sage, who called repeatedly, but\nfruitlessly, upon his valiant son. They then departed; and when Rama returned,\nbearing fuel from the thickets, he found his father lifeless, and thus\nbewailed his unmerited fate: \'Father, in resentment of my actions have you\nbeen murdered by wretches as foolish as they are base! by the sons of\nKarttavirya are you struck down, as a deer in the forest by the huntsman\'s\nshafts! Ill have you deserved such a death; you who have ever trodden the path\nof virtue, and never offered wrong to any created thing! How great is the\ncrime that they have committed, in slaying with their deadly shafts an old man\nlike you, wholly occupied with pious cares, and engaging not in strife! Much\nhave they to boast of to their fellows and their friends, that they have\nshamelessly slain a solitary hermit, incapable of contending in arms!\' Thus\nlamenting, bitterly and repeatedly, Rama performed his father\'s last\nobsequies, and lighted his funeral pile. He then made a vow that he would\nextirpate the whole Kshatriya race. In fulfilment of this purpose he took up\nhis arms, and with remorseless and fatal rage singly destroyed in fight the\nsons of Karttavirya; and after them, whatever Kshatriyas he encountered, Rama,\nthe first of warriors, likewise slew. Thrice seven times did the clear the\nearth of the Kshatriya caste 19; and he filled with their blood the five large\nlakes of Samanta-panchaka, from which he offered libations to the race of\nBhrigu. There did he behold his sire again, and the son of Richika beheld his\nson, and told him what to do. Offering a solemn sacrifice to the king of the\ngods, Jamadagnya presented the earth to the ministering priests. To Ka\xc5\x9byapa he\ngave the altar made of gold, ten fathoms in length, and nine in height 20.\nWith the permission of Ka\xc5\x9byapa, the Brahmans divided it in pieces amongst\nthem, and they were thence\n\np. 404\n\ncalled Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81avayana Brahmans. Having given the earth to Ka\xc5\x9byapa, the hero of\nimmeasurable prowess retired to the Mahendra mountain, where he still resides:\nand in this manner was there enmity between him and the race of Kshatriyas,\nand thus was the whole earth conquered by Rama 21."\n\n____________\n\nThe son of Viswamitra was \xc5\x9aunah\xc5\x9bephas, the descendant of Bhrigu, given by the\ngods, and thence named Devarata 22. Viswamitra had\n\np. 405\n\nother sons also, amongst whom the most celebrated were Madhuchhandas,\nKritajaya, Devadeva, Asht\xcc\x81aka, Kachchapa, and Harita; these founded many\nfamilies, all of whom were known by the name of Kau\xc5\x9bikas, and intermarried\nwith the families of various Rishis 23.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[401:15](vp100.htm#fr_1060) The circumstances of Richika\'s marriage, and the\nbirth of Jamadagni and Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra, are told much in the same manner as in our\ntext both in the Mahabharata and Bhagavata.\n\n[402:16](vp100.htm#fr_1061) In the beginning of the legend occurs the account\nof Karttaviryarjuna, with the addition that he oppressed both men and gods.\nThe latter applying to Vishn\xcc\x81u for succour, he descended to earth, and was\nborn as Para\xc5\x9burama, for the especial purpose of putting the Haihaya king to\ndeath.\n\n[402:17](vp100.htm#fr_1062) In the Rajadharma the sons of the king carry off\nthe calf. The Bhagavata makes the king seize upon the cow, by whose aid\nJamadagni had previously entertained Arjuna and all his train: borrowing, no\ndoubt, these embellishments from the similar legend of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha and\nVi\xc5\x9bwamitra, related in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a.\n\n[402:18](vp100.htm#fr_1063) The characteristic weapon of Rama is however an\naxe (para\xc5\x9bu), whence his name Rama, \'with the axe.\' It was given to him by\n\xc5\x9aiva, whom the hero propitiated on mount Gandhamadana. He at the same time\nreceived instruction in the use of weapons generally, and the art of war. Raja\nDharma.\n\n[403:19](vp100.htm#fr_1064) This more than \'thrice slaying of the slain\' is\nexplained in the Rajadharma to mean, that he killed the men of so many\ngenerations, as fast as they grew up to adolescence.\n\n[403:20](vp100.htm#fr_1065) It is sometimes read Narotsedha, \'as high as a\nman.\'\n\n[404:21](vp100.htm#fr_1066) The story, as told in the Rajadharma section,\nadds, that when Rama had given the earth to Ka\xc5\x9byapa, the latter desired him to\ndepart, as there was no dwelling for him in it, and to repair to the seashore\nof the south, where Ocean made for him (or relinquished to him) the maritime\ndistrict named \xc5\x9aurparaka. The traditions of the Peninsula ascribe the\nformation of the coast of Malabar to this origin, and relate that Para\xc5\x9burama\ncompelled the ocean to retire, and introduced Brahmans and colonists from the\nnorth into Kerala or Malabar. According to some accounts he stood on the\npromontory of Dilli, and shot his arrows to the south, over the site of\nKerala. It seems likely that we have proof of the local legend being at least\nas old as the beginning of the Christian era, as the mons Pyrrhus of Ptolemy\nis probably the mountain of Para\xc5\x9bu or Para\xc5\x9burama. See Catalogue of Mackenzie\nCollection, Introd. p. xcv. and vol. II. p. 74. The Rajadharma also gives an\naccount of the Kshatriyas who escaped even the thrice seven times repeated\ndestruction of their race. Some of the Haihayas were concealed by the earth as\nwomen; the son of Viduratha, of the race of Puru, was preserved in the Riksha\nmountain, where he was nourished by the bears; Sarvakarman, the son of\nSaudasa, was saved by Para\xc5\x9bara, performing the offices of a \xc5\x9audra; Gopati, son\nof \xc5\x9aivi, was nourished by cows in the forests; Vatsa, the son of Pratarddana,\nwas concealed amongst the calves in a cow-pen; the son of Deviratha was\nsecreted by Gautama on the banks of the Ganges; Vrihadratha was preserved in\nGridhrakuta; and descendants of Marutta were saved by the ocean. From these\nthe lines of kings were continued; but it does not appear from the ordinary\nlists that they were ever interrupted. This legend however, as well as that of\nthe Ramayan\xcc\x81a, b. I. c. 52, no doubt intimates a violent and protracted\nstruggle between the Brahmans and Kshatriyas for supreme domination in India,\nas indeed the text of the Mahabharata more plainly denotes, as Earth is made\nto say to Ka\xc5\x9byapa, \'The fathers and grandfathers of these Kshatriyas have been\nkilled by the remorseless Rama in warfare on my account.\'\n\n[404:22](vp100.htm#fr_1067) The story of \xc5\x9aunah\xc5\x9bephas is told by different\nauthorities, with several variations. As the author of various \xc5\x9auktas in the\nRich, he is called the son of Ajigartta. The Ramayan\xcc\x81a makes him the middle\nson of the sage Richika, sold to Ambarisha, king of Ayodhya, by his parents,\nto be a victim in a human sacrifice offered p. 405 by that prince. He is set\nat liberty by Vi\xc5\x9bwamitra, but it is not added that he was adopted. The\nBhagavata concurs in the adoption, but makes \xc5\x9aunah\xc5\x9bephas the son of\nVi\xc5\x9bwamitra\'s sister, by Ajigartta of the line of Bhrigu, and states his being\npurchased as a victim for the sacrifice of Hari\xc5\x9bchandra (see n.\n[9](vp095.htm#fn_979). [p. 372](vp095.htm#page_372)). The Vayu makes him a son\nof Richika, but alludes to his being the victim at Hari\xc5\x9bchandra\'s sacrifice.\nAccording to the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, Viswamitra called upon his sons to take the place\nof \xc5\x9aunah\xc5\x9bephas, and on their refusing, degraded them to the condition of\nChan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81alas. The Bhagavata says, that fifty only of the hundred sons of\nViswamitra were expelled their tribe, for refusing to acknowledge \xc5\x9aunah\xc5\x9bephas\nor Devarata as their elder brother. The others consented; and the Bhagavata\nexpresses this; \'They said to the elder, profoundly versed in the Mantras, We\nare your followers:\' as the commentator; ###. The Ramayan\xcc\x81a also observes,\nthat \xc5\x9aunah\xc5\x9bephas, when bound, praised Indra with Richas or hymns of the Rig-\nveda. The origin of the story therefore, whatever may be its correct version,\nmust be referred to the Vedas; and it evidently alludes to some innovation in\nthe ritual, adopted by a part only of the Kau\xc5\x9bika families of Brahmans.\n\n[405:23](vp100.htm#fr_1068) The Bhagavata says one hundred sons, besides\nDevarata and others, as Asht\xcc\x81aka, Harita, &c. Much longer lists of names are\ngiven in the Vayu, Bhagavata, Brahma, and Hari V. The two latter specify the\nmothers. Thus Deva\xc5\x9bravas, Kati (the founder of the Katyayanas), and\nHiranyaksha were sons of \xc5\x9ailavati; Ren\xcc\x81uka, Galava, Sankriti, Mudgala,\nMadhuchchandas, and Devala were sons of Ren\xcc\x81u; and Asht\xcc\x81aka, Kachchhapa, and\nHarita were the sons of Drishadvati. The same works enumerate the Gotras, the\nfamilies or tribes of the Kau\xc5\x9bika Brahmans: these are, Parthivas, Devaratas,\nYajnawalkyas, Samarshanas, \xc3\x9adumbaras, Dumlanas, Tarakayanas, Munchatas,\nLohitas, Renus, Karishus, Babhrus, Paninas, Dhyanajyapyas, \xc5\x9ayalantas,\nHiranyakshas, \xc5\x9aankus, Galavas, Yamadutas, Devalas, \xc5\x9aalankayanas, Bashkalas,\nDadativadaras, \xc5\x9aau\xc5\x9bratas, \xc5\x9aaindhavayanas, Nishn\xcc\x81atas, Chunchulas,\n\xc5\x9aalankrityas, Sankrityas, Vadaran\xcc\x81yas, and an infinity of others, multiplied\nby intermarriages with other tribes, and who, according to the Vayu, were\noriginally of the regal caste, like Viswamitra; but, like him, obtained\nBrahmanhood through devotion. Now these Gotras, or some of them at least, no\ndoubt existed, partaking more of the character of schools of doctrine, but in\nwhich teachers and scholars were very likely to have become of one family by\nintermarrying; and the whole, as well as their original founder, imply the\ninterference of the Kshatriya caste with the Brahmanical monopoly of religious\ninstruction and composition.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VIII](vp101.htm)\n\n'
