Janamejaya said :-- O Son of Paras'ara! There has arisen a great doubt in\nmy mind on hearing just now your words. These Nara Naraya _n_ a are the two\nsons of Dharma; they are ascetics, calm and quiet, the Ams'as of Vi _sn_ u;\nthey reside in a holy place of pilgrimage! They are filled with the Sattvic\nqualities, subsisting always on roots and fruits of the forest, the highsouled\nhermits and truthful. How were they addicted to such warfare? Why had they\nleft their invaluable asceticism? And with what object were they fighting for\nfull one thousand Deva years with Prahlada.\n\n\n\n5\\. What was the end, O Muni, of their fight with Prahlada? Kindly explain to\nme in detail the cause of this warfare.\n\n\n\n6\\. Women, wealth or any other worldly object can be the cause of any quarrel\nor fight amongst any persons; but, in this case, the two ascetics had none of\nthese; how then this idea of fight sprung within their minds.\n\n\n\n7-8. And why did they practise such severe austerities? Was it that they had\nto overpower others, or enjoy pleasures themselves or to reach Heaven\n\n\n\np. 284\n\n\n\nthat they practised tapasya? What fruits did they eventually obtain from such\npenances?\n\n\n\n9\\. They became very lean and thin through their asceticism; still how could\nthey fight full one thousand Deva years without getting fatigued.\n\n\n\n10\\. They were not entangled in this fight for kingdom, or wealth or for women\nor for any other worldly object; then why did they fight with the high souled\nPrahlada?\n\n\n\n11\\. Having no attachment for any worldly object nor any desire to gain any\nthing therefrom, why did they engage themselves so thoroughly, in such pains\ngiving battle?\n\n\n\n12\\. Intelligent persons always do works leading to bliss; they never do\npainful works; this is the long standing rule of the world.\n\n\n\n13\\. The two sons of Dharma were the Ams'as of Hari, all knowing and adorned\nwith all qualities; why did they fight, subversive of religion?\n\n\n\n14\\. O Mahar _s_ i! Even the dull and stupid persons in the world won't go to\nthese deadly battles leaving asceticism and samadhi, leading to the\npurification of all desires.\n\n\n\n15\\. I have heard that Yayati, the Lord of the earth was dropped from Heaven\nto this world, owing to his Ahamkara, though he was a virtuous king devoted to\ncharities and sacrifices.\n\n\n\n16-17. No sooner Yayati, said the king :-- did As'vamedha sacrifice, etc.,\nwith Ahamkara, egoism, he was dropped by Indra with thunderbolt in his hands.\nSo one can see that, without Ahamkara no fight can occur. The ascetics had no\nbodily strength; therefore if they had to fight, it is through the waste of\ntheir Tapasya that they could do so.\n\n\n\n18\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! The all knowing sages that have realised the truth\nor Dharma declare the threefold Ahamkara arising out the Sattvic, Rajasic and\nTamasic qualities respectively to be the causes of this world.\n\n\n\n19\\. How, then, can these two Munis being embodied forego their Ahamkaras?\nWithout any cause, no actions follow; this is quite certain.\n\n\n\n20\\. Tapas, charities, sacrifices all originate from the Sattvic qualities.\nAnd quarrels arise from the Rajasic or Tamasic qualities.\n\n\n\n21\\. All arise from Ahamkara, whether good or bad; this is quite certain.\n\n\n\n22\\. There is no other thing that enchains a soul than this Ahamkara. It is\nout of Ahamkara that this Universe is created: how can it be then free from\nit?\n\n\n\n23\\. O King! Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes'ha, even these are with Ahamkaras. Then\nhow can you expect other ordinary Munis to be free from it?\n\n\n\np. 285\n\n\n\n24\\. Encased with Ahamkara, this Universe is rolling. Births and death occur\nrepectively through this Karma.\n\n\n\n25\\. O Lord of the earth. The Devas, birds and men are revolving in this world\nlike the wheel of a chariot.\n\n\n\n26\\. In this wide world who can count how many Avataras Vi _sn_ u had to take\nin all sorts of wombs, good or low.\n\n\n\n27\\. Ordained by the Lord of the Universe, Naraya _n_ a Himself had to take\nthe Fish, Tortoise, Boar, Man Lion and the Dwarf incarnations.\n\n\n\n28\\. Vasudeva Janardana the Lord, had to undertake countless Avataras births\nin this world.\n\n\n\n29\\. In the Vaivasvata manvantara, the Avataras of Bhagavan Hari are being\nmentioned to you. Hear!\n\n\n\n30\\. The all pervading Lord of the world, the God of the Gods, had to take\nseveral incarnations in this world, owing to the curses inflicted by Bhrigu.\n\n\n\n31\\. The king said :-- There has now again arisen another fresh doubt, why was\nVi _sn_ u cursed by Bhrigu Muni?\n\n\n\n32\\. O Muni! What injury did Hari commit to that Muni, and whereof the Muni\nBhrigu cursed him.\n\n\n\n33-34. Vyasa said :-- Hear, O king! the cause of the curse; I will narrate to\nyou. In days of yore, the king Hira _n_ yakasipu, the son of Kasyapa often\nquarrelled with the Devas; owing to this incessant warfare, the whole universe\nwas much alarmed and perplexed.\n\n\n\n35\\. And when Hiranyakasipu was slain by the Man-Lion incarnation, Prahlada,\nthe tormentor of the foes, continued his enmity towards the Devas and began to\nannoy them.\n\n\n\n36\\. Thus one hundred years dreadful battle occurred between the Devas and\nPrahlada, to the astonishment of all.\n\n\n\n37-38. O king! The Devas fought very hard and were victorious. Prahlada was\ndefeated and was sorely grieved. Hearing that the Eternal Religion is the\nbest, he handed his kingdom over to his son Bali and went to the Gandhamadan\nhill to practise tapasya.\n\n\n\n39-40. The prosperous Bali, too, on gaining his kingdom, began to quarrel with\nthe Devas and the war thus went on. Ultimately the powerful Indra and the\nDevas defeated the Asuras.\n\n\n\n41-42. O king! Indra, of unequalled prowess, with the aid of Vi _sn_ u,\ndeprived the Daityas of their kingdom. The defeated Daityas took refuge of\ntheir family spiritual guide S'ukracharya and addressed him thus, O Brahmana!\nYou are endowed with your fiery strength of Tapasya and you are now\n\n\n\np. 286\n\n\n\npowerful; why are you not lending your helping hands to your Daitya followers.\nO foremost of the councillors. If you do not help us and save us, we will not\nbe able to stay in this earth and will soon have to go down to Patala.\n\n\n\n43-44. Vyasa said :-- Thus addressed by the Daityas, the very kind hearted\nS'ukracharya said, O Daityas! Do not be afraid; I will protect you by my fire\nof strength and vigour; and help you with sound counsels and medicines. Be\nbrave and energetic and cast aside your mental agony and sorrow.\n\n\n\n45-47. Vyasa said :-- O king! The Daityas became fearless under the patronage\nof S'ukracharya. The Devas had their spies and knew all about these. They held\ncouncils with Indra and settled that before the Daityas had time to dislodge\nus from our Heaven with the mantra of S'ukracharya, we will speedily go and\nattack them. Thus attacked all on a sudden, they will all be slain by us and\nwe will drive them down to the Patala.\n\n\n\n48\\. Thus forming their resolves, with fully equipped arms and weapons, they\nwent out of rage to fight with the Daityas and orderd by Indra and aided by Vi\n_sn_ u, they began to kill the Demons.\n\n\n\n49\\. When the Devas were thus slaying the Demons, they got very much terrified\nand exclaimed \xc2\x93O Lord! Protect us! Protect us!\xc2\x94 and took the refuge of Sukra.\n\n\n\n50\\. S'ukracharya, seeing the Daityas very much perplexed and distracted, at\nonce cried aloud out of the influence of his Mantra \xc2\x93No fear, no fear,\xc2\x94 Then\nthe Devas on seeing S'ukracharya left the Daityas and fled away to their own\nplaces.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Tenth Chapter of the Fourth Book of the Maha Pura _n_ am, S'ri\nMad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa on the curse on\nVi _sn_ u by Bhrigu.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 11](bk04ch11.htm)\n\n"
