On account of the difference of sense of piercing and so on.\n\nThe text of the \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas exhibits at the beginning of their Upanishad\nsome mantras, 'Pierce the _s_ ukra, pierce the heart.' The followers of the\nSama-veda read at the beginning of their rahasya-brahma _n_ a 'O God Savit\n_ri_ , promote the sacrifice.' The Ka _th_ akas and the Taittiriyakas have\n'May Mitra be propitious to us, may Varu _n_ a be propitious.' The Sa _t_\nyayanins have 'Thou art a white horse, a tawny and a black one!' The\nKaushitakins have a Brahma _n_ a referring to the Mahavrata-ceremony, 'Indra\nhaving slain V _ri_ tra became great.' The Kaushitakins also have a Mahavrata-\nbrahma _n_ a. 'Pra _g_ apati is the year; his Self is that Mahavrata.' The Va\n_g_ asaneyins have a Brahma _n_ a referring to the Pravargya, 'The gods sat\n\np. 645\n\ndown for a sattra-celebration.' With reference to all this a doubt arises\nwhether these mantras and the sacrificial works referred to in the Brahma _n_\na texts form parts of the meditations enjoined in the Upanishads or not.--The\nPurvapakshin affirms this, on the ground that as the mantras and works are\nmentioned in the immediate neighbourhood of the meditations the idea of their\nforming parts of the latter naturally presents itself. Such mantras as 'pierce\nthe heart' and works such as the pravargya may indeed--on the basis of direct\nstatement ( _s_ ruti), inferential mark (linga), and syntactical connexion\n(vakya), which are stronger than mere proximity--be understood to be connected\nwith certain actions; but, on the other hand, mantras such as 'May Varu _n_ a\nbe propitious' have no application elsewhere, and are suitable introductions\nto meditations. We therefore take them to be parts of the meditations, and\nhence hold that those mantras are to be included in all meditations.--This\nview the Sutra sets aside 'on account of the difference of sense of piercing,\nand so on.' The inferential marks contained in texts such as 'pierce the _s_\nukra, pierce the heart'; 'I shall speak the right, I shall speak the true,'\nshow that the mantras have an application in connexion with certain magical\npractices, or else the study of the Veda, and the like, and do not therefore\nform part of meditations. That is to say--in the same way as the mantra\n'pierce the heart' enables us to infer that also the mantra 'pierce the _s_\nukra' belongs to some magical rite, so we infer from the special meaning of\nmantras such as 'I shall speak the right,' &c., that also mantras such as 'May\nMitra be propitious' are connected with the study of the Veda, and do not\ntherefore form part of meditations. That mantras of this kind and Brahma _n_ a\npassages relative to the Pravargya and the like are placed at the beginning of\nUpanishads is owing to their having, like the latter, to be studied in the\nforest.--Herewith terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'piercing and the like.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 26.
