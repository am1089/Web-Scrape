Leprosy cured by a dark plant.\n\n1\\. The eagle (suparna) that was born at first, his gall thou wast, O plant.\nThe \xc3\x82suri having conquered this (gall) gave it to the trees for their colour.  \n2\\. The \xc3\x82suri was the first to construct this remedy for leprosy, this\ndestroyer of leprosy. She has destroyed the leprosy, has made the skin of even\ncolour.  \n3\\. 'Even-colour' is the name of thy mother; 'Even-colour' is the name of thy\nfather; thou, O plant, producest even colour: render this (spot) of even\ncolour!  \n4\\. The black (plant) that produces even colour has been fetched out of the\nearth. Do thou now, pray, perfect this, construct anew the colours!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 83.
