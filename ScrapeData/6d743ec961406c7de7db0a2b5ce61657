(The soul is) an agent, on account of Scripture (thus) having a purport.\n\nIt has been shown that the individual Self is a knowing subject and atomic.\nNow the question arises whether that Self is an agent or, being itself non-\nactive, erroneously ascribes to itself the activity of the non-sentient gu _n_\nas. The prima facie answer is that the individual Self is not an agent, since\nthe sacred texts concerned with the Self declare that the Self does not act,\nwhile the gu _n_ as do act. Thus, e.g. in the Ka _th_ avalli, where the text\nat first denies of the individual Self all the attributes of Prak _ri_ ti,\nsuch as being born, ageing and dying ('he is not born, he does not die'), and\nthen also denies that the Self is the agent in acts such as killing and the\nlike, 'If the slayer thinks that he slays, if the slain thinks that he is\nslain, they both do not understand; for this one does not slay, nor is that\none slain' (I, 2, 19). This means--if one thinks the Self to be the slayer one\ndoes not know the Self. And the Lord himself teaches that non-agency is the\nessential nature of the individual soul, and that it is mere delusion on the\nSelf's part to ascribe to itself agency. 'By the attributes (gu _n_ a) of Prak\n_ri_ ti, actions are wrought all round.' He who is deluded by self-conceit\nthinks 'I am the agent'; 'when the seer beholds no other agent than the gu _n_\nas'; 'Prak _ri_ ti is said to be the cause of all agency of causes and\neffects, whilst the soul is the cause of all enjoyment of pleasure and pain'\n(Bha. Gi. III, 27; XIV, 19; XIII, 20).--The soul, therefore, is an enjoyer\nonly, while all agency belongs to Prak _ri_ ti--To this the Sutra replies, 'an\nagent, on account of Scripture thus having a meaning.' The Self only is an\nagent, not the gu _n_ as, because thus only Scripture has a meaning. For the\nscriptural injunctions, such as 'he who desires the heavenly world is to\nsacrifice,' 'He who desires Release is to meditate on Brahman,' and similar\nones, enjoin action on him only who will enjoy the fruit\n\np. 554\n\nof the action--whether the heavenly world, or Release, or anything else. If a\nnon-sentient thing were the agent, the injunction would not be addressed to\nanother being (viz. to an intelligent being--to which it actually is\naddressed). The term ' _s_ astra' (scriptural injunction) moreover comes from\n_s_ as, to command, and commanding means impelling to action. But scriptural\ninjunctions impel to action through giving rise to a certain conception (in\nthe mind of the being addressed), and the non-sentient Pradhana cannot be made\nto conceive anything. Scripture therefore has a sense only, if we admit that\nnone but the intelligent enjoyer of the fruit of the action is at the same\ntime the agent. Thus the Purva Mima _m_ sa declares 'the fruit of the\ninjunction belongs to the agent' (III, 7, 18). The Purvapakshin had contended\nthat the text 'if the slayer thinks, &c.,' proves the Self not to be the agent\nin the action of slaying; but what the text really means is only that the Self\nas being eternal cannot be killed. The text, from Sm _ri_ ti, which was\nalleged as proving that the gu _n_ as only possess active power, refers to the\nfact that in all activities lying within the sphere of the sa _m_ sara, the\nactivity of the Self is due not to its own nature but to its contact with the\ndifferent gu _n_ as. The activity of the gu _n_ as, therefore, must be viewed\nnot as permanent, but occasional only. In the same sense Sm _ri_ ti says 'the\nreason is the connexion of the soul with the guwas, in its births, in good and\nevil wombs' (Bha. Gi. XIII, 21). Similarly it is said there (XVIII, 16) that\n'he who through an untrained understanding looks upon the isolated Self as an\nagent, that man of perverted mind does not see'; the meaning being that, since\nit appears from a previous passage that the activity of the Self depends on\nfive factors (as enumerated in _s_ l. 16), he who views the isolated Self to\nbe an agent has no true insight.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 34.
