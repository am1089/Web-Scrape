Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the Ri _s_ i\xc2\x92s words, the king\nSuratha and Vais\xc2\x92ya, who were very distressed in their minds, became very much\ncomforted and bowed down to the Muni with great humility and modesty. Their\neyes expressed their gladness and their hearts were filled with loving\ndevotion. Both of them, then, clever in speaking and of calm and quiet temper,\nbegan to address him with their folded hands. O Bhagavan! We were passing our\ndays in a very humble and distressed spot; we are today purified by your good\nwords, just as the country was rendered pure by Bhagiratha when he brought\ndown the river Ganges here. The saints, adorned with purely good qualities,\nare incessantly engaged in doing good to others and how the people can be made\nhappy. O Intelligent One! Surely we have come to this auspicious \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama owing\nto our past good deeds (in previous births) and all our miseries are therefore\nbrought to their ends today. There are good many persons that roam in this\nworld for their selfish ends; very few there exist like you who are always\nready to do good to others. O Muni! True that I am very much distressed\n\n\n\np. 478\n\n\n\nbut this Vais\xc2\x92ya is more distressed than me. Both of us, very much afflicted\nby the miseries of the world, have come gladly to your \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama and are\nrelieved of our bodily sufferings by your sight; and now, hearing your words,\nwe are relieved also of our mental pain and sufferings. O Brahma _n_ a! We are\nvery much blessed and our objects have been gained by your nectar-like words;\nO Thou, the Ocean of mercy! You have purified us, out of your unbounded mercy.\nWe are quite tired of this world; knowing this, do you lead us beyond this\nworld by holding our hands and by initiating us with Mantrams. O Best of\nMunis! We will first of all practise a very hard Tapasya (asceticism) and\nworship Bhagavati, the Awarder of happiness; then, seeing Her, we will go to\nour respective abodes. Now we expect the nine-lettered Mantram of the Devi\nfrom your mouth and practising the Navaratra varam we will fast and meditate\non the Mantram.\n\n\n\n[Note :-- The nine-lettered Mantram is \xc2\x93Om Mahi _s_ amardinyai Svaha.\xc2\x94 Instead\nof Om, any of the following may be used :-- Hrim, Klim, Aim, Strim, or Hum\nmentioned in Sarada Tilaka, Narayani Tantra, or in Vis\xc2\x92vasara Tantra (see page\n125 of Tantra Sara ).]\n\n\n\n13-30. Vyasa said :-- O King! When the king and Vais\xc2\x92ya prayed thus to the\nMuni Sumedha, the best of the Munis, gave them the auspicious Mantram with its\nseed (Vija) and as well what is to be meditated (Dhyan). On getting the\nMantram (with Ri _s_ i, Chhanda, seed S\xc2\x92akti, and Devata) duly, they welcomed\nthe Muni and with his permission went to the holy bank of a river. Both of\nthem were of delicate frames and both of them were fully determined; they went\nto a very solitary place and selected their place and took their seats there.\nThere they spent one month in repeating silently the Mantram and in chanting\nthe three glorious deeds of Cha _nd_ i. In this short period of one month,\nthey became very much attached to the lotus-feet of Bhavani and their minds\nwere also much pacified. They attended to no other business; only they used to\ngo to the Muni once a day and bowing down before him they returned to their\nown seats of Kus\xc2\x92a grass and gave themselves up to the meditation of the Devi\nand always repeated silently their Mantrams. O King! One year thus passed\naway; they then abstained from taking fruits and subsisted on the leaves of\ntrees. Thus engaged in meditation and asceticism they passed away another year\nsustaining themselves with dry leaves only. O King! When the two years thus\npassed, they got in their dreams the beautiful vision of the Goddess\nBhagavati. They were very much delighted to see in their dreams the Ambika\nDevi in red robes and decorated with various ornaments. They practised tapasya\nin the third year with water as\n\n\n\np. 479\n\n\n\ntheir only food. Thus when they found that, after practising the tapas for\nthree years, they could not see face to face the Devi they became very anxious\nto see the Devi and thought thus :-- \xc2\x93When we have not been so fortunate as to\nsee the Devi, Who art the Bestower of peace and happiness to the human beings,\nwe will then leave our bodies, in deep distress and sorrow!\xc2\x94 Thus thinking,\nthe King prepared a beautiful triangular Ku _nd_ a (pit), firm and of one hand\nmeasure. Lighting a fire in that pit, the King began to cut off slices of\nflesh from his own body and offered them as oblations to the fire. The\nVais\xc2\x92ya, too, then did the same. O King! Both of them were very much excited\nand began to offer their blood as oblation to the Devi. The Devi Bhagavati,\nthen, seeing them thus grieved, and that their hearts were over flown with\ndevotion towards Her, appeared direct before them and said thus :--\n\n\n\n31-32. O King! You are my favourite devotees; I am pleased with your Tapasya;\nnow ask whatever you desire; I will grant you that boon. Then She spoke to the\nVais\xc2\x92ya :-- \xc2\x93O Highly Fortunate One! I am pleased; ask without any delay any\nboon; I will grant that just now.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n33-52. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the words of the Devi, the king\nSuratha was very much delighted and said thus :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! Grant me this boon\nthat I be able today to conquer my enemies with my own power and that I may\nregain my kingdom.\xc2\x94 The Devi then spoke to him thus :-- \xc2\x93O King! Go to your\nown abode; your enemies are now enfeebled and will certainly be defeated.\n\n\n\n(Note :-- The Devi has now withdrawn Her own power from the enemies with which\nthey were filled before. This is the result of the real sacrifice to the\nDevi.)\n\n\n\nO Fortunate One! Your ministers will all come and prostrate themselves before\nyour feet and will be obedient to you; you can now go back to your city and\ngovern your subjects happily. O King! Thus reign for Ajuta years (10,000\nyears) over your widely extended dominion; then, when you quit your body, you\nwill again be born from Surya, and be known widely as Savar _n_ i Manu.\xc2\x94 Vyasa\nsaid :-- O King! The pure-natured Vais\xc2\x92ya said with folded hands :-- \xc2\x93O Devi!\nI have nothing to do with house, sons, nor wealth. O Mother! The house, wealth\nand sons, all these are so many sources of bondage to this world and are very\ntransitory like dreams. Therefore give me knowledge so that my ties to this\nworld be cut asunder. Persons who are devoid of knowledge, those fools are\nmerged in this ocean of world. The wise never prefer this Samsara; therefore\nthey can cross this world. Vyasa\n\n\n\np. 480\n\n\n\nsaid :-- O King! Hearing this, the Mahamaya said to the Vais\xc2\x92ya, that stood in\nfront of Her thus :-- \xc2\x93O Vais\xc2\x92ya! No doubt you will acquire knowledge.\xc2\x94 Thus\ngranting boons to them, the Devi then and there disappeared. After the Devi\nhad disappeared, the King bowed down to the Muni, mounted on his horse and\nexpressed a desire to go back to his kingdom. Just at that time all his\nministers and subjects came humbly before him, bowed down to him and standing\nbefore him with folded hands, said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Your enemies all had acted\nvery sinfully; hence they were all slain in battle; you be pleased now to\nremain in your city, free from any enemy and govern your subjects.\xc2\x94 The King,\nhearing thus, bowed down to the Muni and with his permission, started towards\nhis kingdom, surrounded by his ministers. On regaining his own kingdom, wife,\nrelatives and kinsmen he began to enjoy the sea-girt earth. On the other hand,\nthe Vais\xc2\x92ya became illumined with the Spiritual Knowledge and all his\nconnections and attachments being completely severed, became free from all\nbondages. He became liberated in his lifetime and travelled always from one\nplace of pilgrimage to another and passed away his time in singing the\nglorious deeds of the Devi. O King! Thus I have described to you the most\nwonderful character of the Devi, what fruits were obtained by the King and the\nVais\xc2\x92ya on their worshipping Her, how the Daityas were killed by Her and about\nHer auspicious appearances on this earth. Oh! Such is the glory of the Devi,\nleading to fearlessness amongst Her devotees. The mortal who hears constantly\nthis excellent pure narrative of the Devi Bhagavati, gets truly all the best\nand wonderful pleasures of this world. No doubt anybody who hears this\nwonderful incident, will obtain knowledge, liberation, fame, happiness and\npurity. The essence of all religions lies in this narration; therefore it\nleads, above all, to Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Mok _s_ a (religion, wealth,\ndesire and liberation). It grants all desires to human beings.\n\n\n\n53-54. Suta said :-- O Ri _s_ is! The Mahar _s_ i Vyasa, the son of Satyavati,\nversed in all the departments of knowledge, asked by the King Janamejaya,\nnarrated to him this divine Samhita. The character of Cha _nd_ ika, the\nkilling of the Daitya S\xc2\x92umbha, were thus narrated by the merciful Muni Veda\nVyasa. O Munis! I, too, have described to you the main points of this Pura _n_\na. Here ends the Fifth Book.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty-fifth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the receiving of the\nboons by the King Suratha and the Vais\xc2\x92ya Samadhi in the Devi Bhagavatam, the\nMaha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\nThe Fifth Book Completed.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 1](bk06ch01.htm)\n\n'
