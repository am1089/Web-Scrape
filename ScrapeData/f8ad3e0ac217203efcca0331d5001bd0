DUTIES OF MAN AND WIFE.\n\n1. 1 The whole set of commandments concerning adultery has thus been stated; listen to me proclaiming the conduct prescribed for man and wife.\n\n2. 2 A woman must be restrained from slight transgressions even by her relations; by night and by day she must be watched by her mother-in-law and other wives belonging to the family.\n\n3. 3 A father who does not give his daughter in\n\np. 368\n\nmarriage in proper time (before she has reached maturity), a husband who has\nnot connexion with his wife at the time favourable for procreation, and a son\nwho does not support his mother: all such deserve contempt and shall be\npunished as ordained in law.\n\n4. 4 Employing (a woman) in the receipt and expenditure (of wealth), in the preparation of food, in the preservation of domestic utensils, in purification, and in the care of the (sacred household) fire, is declared to be the (best) way of guarding women.\n\n5. 5 Let not a woman reside in another man's house, separated from her father, husband, or sons; by (giving way to) malicious propensities, particularly, she is sure to lose her reputation.\n\n6. 6 Rising before (the others), paying reverence to the elders of the family, preparing food and condiments, and using a low seat and bed: thus have the duties of women been declared.\n\n7. 7 Drinking (spirituous liquor), rambling abroad, sleeping by day, and neglect of her daily duties, are faults disgracing a woman.\n\n8. 8 That wife is declared to be devoted to her husband who is afflicted when he is afflicted, pleased when he is happy, squalid and languid when he is absent, and who dies when he dies.\n\n9. 9 While her husband is absent, a woman must avoid decorating herself, as well as dancing, singing,\n\np. 369\n\nlooking on at public spectacles or festivals, and using meat or intoxicating\ndrinks.\n\n10. 10 A wife practising religious austerities, fasting and preserving her chastity, self-controlled and liberal always, goes to heaven even though she have no son.\n\n11. 11 A wife is considered half the body (of her husband), equally sharing the result of his good or wicked deeds; whether she ascends the pile after him, or chooses to survive him leading a virtuous life, she promotes the welfare of her husband.\n\n12. 12 The Niyoga (appointment of a widow to raise offspring to her deceased lord) has been declared by Manu, and again prohibited by the same; on account of the successive deterioration of the (four) ages of the world, it must not be practised by mortals (in the present age) according to law.\n\n13\\. In the ages K _ri_ ta, Treta, and Dvapara, men were imbued with devotion\nand sacred knowledge; in the (present or) Kali age, a decrease of its power\nhas been ordained for the human race.\n\n14\\. The various sons who were appointed by ancient sages cannot be adopted\nnow by men of the present age, as they are destitute of power.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[367:1](sbe3382.htm#fr_1208) XXIV, 1.
