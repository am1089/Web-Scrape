And because only on the existence (of the cause) (the effect) is\nobserved.\n\nFor the following reason also the effect is non-different from the cause,\nbecause only when the cause exists the effect is observed to exist, not when\nit does not exist. For instance, only when the clay exists the jar is observed\nto exist, and the cloth only when the threads exist. That it is not a general\nrule that when one thing exists another is also observed to exist, appears,\nfor instance, from the fact, that a horse which is other (different) from a\ncow is not observed to exist only when a cow exists. Nor is the jar observed\nto exist only when the potter exists; for in that case non-difference\n\np. 331\n\ndoes not exist, although the relation between the two is that of an operative\ncause and its effect 1.--But--it may be objected--even in the case of things\nother (i.e. non-identical) we find that the observation of one thing regularly\ndepends on the existence of another; smoke, for instance, is observed only\nwhen fire exists.--We reply that this is untrue, because sometimes smoke is\nobserved even after the fire has been extinguished; as, for instance, in the\ncase of smoke being kept by herdsmen in jars.--Well, then--the objector will\nsay--let us add to smoke a certain qualification enabling us to say that smoke\nof such and such a kind 2 does not exist unless fire exists.--Even thus, we\nreply, your objection is not valid, because we declare that the reason for\nassuming the non-difference of cause and effect is the fact of the internal\norgan (buddhi) being affected (impressed) by cause and effect jointly 3. And\nthat does not take place in the case of fire and smoke.--Or else we have to\nread (in the Sutra) 'bhavat,' and to translate, 'and on account of the\nexistence or observation.' The non-difference of cause and effect results not\nonly from Scripture but also from the existence of perception. For the non-\ndifference of the two is perceived, for instance, in an aggregate of threads,\nwhere we do not perceive a thing called 'cloth,' in addition to the threads,\nbut merely threads running lengthways and crossways. So again, in the threads\nwe perceive finer threads (the aggregate\n\np. 332\n\nof which is identical with the grosser threads), in them again finer threads,\nand so on. On the ground of this our perception we conclude that the finest\nparts which we can perceive are ultimately identical with their causes, viz.\nred, white, and black (the colours of fire, water, and earth, according to\n_Kh_. Up. VI, 4); those, again, with air, the latter with ether, and ether\nwith Brahman, which is one and without a second. That all means of proof lead\nback to Brahman (as the ultimate cause of the world; not to pradhana, &c.), we\nhave already explained.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[331:1](sbe34154.htm#fr_293) So that from the instance of the potter and the\njar we cannot conclude that the relation of clay and the jar is only that of\nnimitta and naimittika, not that of non-difference.\n\n[331:2](sbe34154.htm#fr_294) For instance, smoke extending in a long line\nwhose base is connected with some object on the surface of the earth.\n\n[331:3](sbe34154.htm#fr_295) I.e. (as \xc3\x82n. Gi. explains) because we assume the\nrelation of cause and effect not merely on the ground of the actual existence\nof one thing depending on that upon another, but on the additional ground of\nthe mental existence, the consciousness of the one not being possible without\nthe consciousness of the other.--Tadbhavanuvidhayibhavatvam\ntadbhananuvidhayibhanatva _m_ _k_ a karyasya kara _n_ ananyatve hetur dhumavi\n_s_ eshasya _k_ agnibhavanuvidhayibhavatve#pi na tadbhananuvidhayibhanatvam\nagnibhanasya dhumabhanadhinatvat.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 16](sbe34155.htm)\n\n"
