'Anybody but a Brahma _n_ a shall suffer corporal punishment for\nadultery.' 1\n\n2\\. 'The wives (of men) of all castes must be guarded more carefully than\nwealth.' 2\n\n3\\. 'But corporal punishment (shall) not (be inflicted) for (adultery with)\nthe wives of minstrels and with those who appear on the stage. For (the\nhusbands) carry them (to other men), or, lying concealed (at home), permit\nthem to hold culpable intercourse.' 3\n\n4\\. 'Women (possess) an unrivalled means of purification; they never become\n(entirely) foul. For month by month their temporary uncleanness removes their\nsins.' 4\n\n5\\. 'Soma gave them cleanliness, the Gandharva their melodious voice, and Fire\npurity of all (limbs); therefore women are free from stains.' 5\n\np. 234\n\n6\\. 'Let him abandon a barren (wife) in the tenth year, one who bears\ndaughters (only) in the twelfth, one whose children (all) die in the\nfifteenth, but her who is quarrelsome without delay.' 6\n\n7\\. A widow shall avoid during a year (the use of) honey, meat, spirituous\nliquor, and salt, and sleep on the ground. 7\n\n8\\. Maudgalya (declares that she shall do so) during six months.\n\n9\\. After (the expiration of) that (time) she may, with the permission of her\nGurus, bear a son to her brother-in-law, in case she has no son. 9\n\n10\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): One whose appointment can have\nno result, (viz.) a barren woman, one who has borne sons, one who is past\nchild-bearing, one whose children are (all) dead, and one who is unwilling\nmust not be appointed.' 10\n\n11\\. The sister of a maternal uncle and of the father, a sister, a sister's\ndaughter, a daughter-in-law, a maternal uncle's wife, and the wife of a 11\n\np. 235\n\nfriend are females who must never be approached (agamya).\n\n12\\. For intercourse with females who must not be approached (agamya), a K\n_ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra and an Atik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra (and) a _K_ andraya _n_ a are\nthe penances prescribed for all.\n\n13\\. Thereby (the rule regarding) intercourse with a female of the _K_ a _n_\n_d_ ala caste has been declared. 13\n\n14\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): A Brahma _n_ a who\nunintentionally approaches a female of the _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala caste, eats (food\ngiven by a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala) or receives (presents from him), becomes an\noutcast; but (if he does it) intentionally, he becomes equal (to a _K_ a _n_\n_d_ ala). 14\n\n15\\. 'He who approaches his father's, his teacher's, or a king's wife, is\nguilty of the crime of violating a Guru's bed; the penance ordained for him\nhas been declared above.' 15\n\n16\\. (A Brahma _n_ a) who is unable (to subsist) by teaching, sacrificing for\nothers, or the acceptance of gifts, shall maintain himself by following the\nduties of Kshatriyas, because that is the next following (caste). 16\n\np. 236\n\n17\\. Gautama (declares that one shall) not (act thus). For the duties of\nKshatriyas are too cruel for a Brahma _n_ a. 17\n\n18\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Out of regard for the sacred\nlaw a Brahma _n_ a and a Vai _s_ ya may take up arms for (the protection of)\ncows or Brahma _n_ as, or when a confusion of the castes (threatens to take\nplace). 18\n\n19\\. (Or) the livelihood of a Vai _s_ ya should be adopted, because that is\nthe one following (next): 19\n\n20\\. (If he lives by agriculture) he shall plough before breakfast, 20\n\n21\\. With two bulls whose noses have not been pierced, not striking them with\nthe goad, (but) frequently coaxing them.\n\n22\\. The (sacred domestic) fire (shall be kindled) at the wedding; the\nreligious ceremonies up to the Agnyadheya (shall be) performed in that. 22\n\np. 237\n\n23\\. Now, beginning with the Agnyadheya, follow these (rites in an)\nuninterrupted (series), as, for instance, the Agnyadheya, the Agnihotra, the\nnew and full moon sacrifices, the \xc3\x82graya.a at the winter and summer solstices,\nthe animal sacrifice, the _K_ aturmasyas at the beginning of each season, the\nSha _d_ _dh_ ot _ri_ in spring, the Agnish _t_ oma. Thus the attainment of\nbliss (is secured). 23\n\n24\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Neither he who is accustomed\nto sleep in the day-time, nor he who eats the food of anybody, nor he who\nfalls from a height to which he has climbed, can reach heaven as he desires.'\n24\n\n25\\. Let him avoid meanness, hard-heartedness, and crookedness. 25\n\n26\\. Now they quote also with reference to this (subject the following) verse\nin the dialogue between the daughters of U _s_ anas and V _ri_ shaparvan:\n'Thou, forsooth, art the daughter of one who praises (others), who begs and\naccepts (gifts); but I am the child of one who is praised, who gives gifts and\ndoes not accept them.' 26\n\np. 238\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[233:1](sbe1458.htm#fr_1150) **4**. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 26, 20; 10, 27, 11.\nGovinda thinks that non-Brahmanical offenders should be burned, in accordance\nwith Vasish _th_ a XXI, 2-3. But mutilation may also be intended. Sa _m_ graha\n_n_ a, 'adultery,' probably includes all those acts mentioned Manu VIII,\n354-358.\n\n[233:2](sbe1458.htm#fr_1151) Manu VIII, 359.\n\n[233:3](sbe1458.htm#fr_1152) Manu VIII, 362. I read conjecturally, 'sa _m_ sar\n_g_ ayanti ta hyeta nigupta _s_ _k_ alayantyapi,' basing my emendations on\nManu's text. The MSS. and Govinda have, sa _m_ sar _g_ ayanti ta hyetan\nnigupta _m_ _s_ _k_ alayanty api, which gives no good sense. Govinda explains\n_k_ ara _n_ adara _h_ , 'the wives of minstrels,' by devadasya _h_ , 'temple-\nslaves.'\n\n[233:4](sbe1458.htm#fr_1153) Vasish _th_ a XXVIII, 4.\n\n[233:5](sbe1458.htm#fr_1154) Vasish _th_ a XXVIII, 6.\n\n[234:6](sbe1458.htm#fr_1155) Manu IX, 81.\n\n[234:7](sbe1458.htm#fr_1156)-8. Vasish _th_ a XVII, 55. The word madya,\n'spirituous liquor,' occurs in M. and the I. O. copy of the commentary. The\nMSS. from the Dekhan and Gu _g_ arat, including K., read ma _g_ _g_ ana or ma\n_d_ _d_ ana, the compound letter being very indistinct.\n\n[234:9](sbe1458.htm#fr_1157) Vasish _th_ a XVII, 56, where the term 'Gurus' is\nfully explained.\n\n[234:10](sbe1458.htm#fr_1158) Vasish _th_ a XVII, 57-59. M. and the two copies\nof the commentary read pi _s_ a _k_ otpannaputra _k_ a instead of vasa _k_\notpannaputra _k_ a, 'a barren woman and one who has borne sons.' I follow the\nDekhan and Gu _g_ arat MSS., which undoubtedly give the genuine reading.\nPerhaps the term ava _s_ am, Vasish _th_ a XVII, 57, should be corrected to va\n_s_ am.\n\n[234:11](sbe1458.htm#fr_1159)-12. These two Sutras are additions to II, 1, 2,\n13. See also Narada XII, 73-74; Vasish _th_ a XXI, 16.\n\n[235:13](sbe1458.htm#fr_1160) Vasish _th_ a XXIII, 41; Vish _n_ u LIII, 5-6.\n\n[235:14](sbe1458.htm#fr_1161) Manu XI, 176.\n\n[235:15](sbe1458.htm#fr_1162) Govinda thinks that the penance intended is that\nmentioned in Sutra 12. Probably a severer one is meant. The verse is\ninteresting, as it clearly is a quotation from some metrical work on law, not\nmerely of traditional detached _s_ lokas.\n\n[235:16](sbe1458.htm#fr_1163) Vasish _th_ a II, 22. The Sutra 'adhyapanaya _g_\nanapratigrahair a _s_ akta _h_ kshatradharme _n_ a _g_ ivet pratyanantaratvat'\noccurs in the two copies of the commentary only. The I. O. copy of the\ncommentary has, however, before it the following words: [dharmya]\nsvadhyayaprava _k_ ane evety adhikana _m_ [kara _m_ ] dar _s_ ayati pratig\n_ri_ hita tad _ri_ k pratigrahitara _m_ g _ri_ dhnuvanti [tara _ri_ dhnu\xc2\xb0]\n_ri_ tvigya _g_ amana ya _g_ inau p. 236[\xc2\xb0 _g_ ane] tada _s_ aktau\nkshatradharmau. M. reads, dharmanasvadhyayaprava _k_ ana [ne] ityadhikara _n_\ndar _s_ ayati pratigrahitad _ri_ k pratigrahitara _ri_ dhnuvanti _ri_ tvigya\n_g_ amana ya _g_ anau tada _s_ aktau svadhyayadhya [\xc2\xb0yadhya] panaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\naya _g_ anapratigrahair a _s_ aktama [ta _h_ ] kshatradharmme _n_ a givet. The\nDekhan and Gu _g_ arat MSS. read, dharmye svadhyayaprava _k_ ane ityadhikara\n_m_ dar _s_ ayati | pratigrahe data pratigrahita[ra] _ri_ dhnuvanti | _ri_\ntvigya _g_ amana ya _g_ ane | tada _s_ aktau kshatradharme _n_ a _g_ ivayet,\nor have corruptions of this passage. I cannot come to any other conclusion\nthan that the passage which precedes the words translated by me are a very\nancient interpolation, caused by the embodiment of a portion of an old Bhashya\nwith the text, and that all our MSS., however much they may differ, go back to\none codex archetypus.\n\n[236:17](sbe1458.htm#fr_1164) Gautama Introduction, p. lii.\n\n[236:18](sbe1458.htm#fr_1165) Gautama VII, 25.\n\n[236:19](sbe1458.htm#fr_1166) Vasish _th_ a II, 24.\n\n[236:20](sbe1458.htm#fr_1167)-21. Vasish _th_ a II, 32.\n\n[236:22](sbe1458.htm#fr_1168) Vasish _th_ a VIII, 3. The religious ceremonies\nto be performed with the sacred domestic fire, which, according to Baudhayana,\np. 237 should be kindled at the wedding, not on the division of the paternal\nestate (Gautama V, q), are the so-called G _ri_ hya ceremonies (Gautama V,\n8-9).\n\n[237:23](sbe1458.htm#fr_1169) Vasish _th_ a XI, 46. The sacrifices enumerated\nin this Sutra require three fires, and belong to the _s_ rauta or vaitanika ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as. The Sha _d_ _dh_ ot _ri_ mentioned here seems to be the animal\nsacrifice mentioned in the commentary on Katyayana _S_ rauta-sutra VI, 1, 36.\n\n[237:24](sbe1458.htm#fr_1170) An aru _dh_ apatita, 'he who falls from a height\nto which he has climbed,' is, according to Govinda, an ascetic who slides back\ninto civil life.\n\n[237:25](sbe1458.htm#fr_1171) Vasish _th_ a VI, 40; X, 30. Govinda explains\n_s_ a _th_ yam, 'hard-heartedness,' by _s_ aktau satyam api paropakara _k_ ara\n_n_ am, 'not doing a kindness to others though one is able to do so.'\n\n[237:26](sbe1458.htm#fr_1172) The dialogue mentioned is that between _S_\narmish _th_ a and p. 238 Devayani, which occurs Mahabharata I, 78. The verse\nquoted is the tenth of that Adhyaya, and agrees with ours, except that sutaham\nis read for athaham in the beginning of the second half verse.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Adhyaya 3, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 5](sbe1459.htm)\n\n"
