They spake, 'Whereby have we succeeded in\nthis?'--'By means of the Garhapatya,' they said; 'for, after building the\nGarhapatya 1 and mounting thereon, we saw the first layer, from the first (we\nsaw) the second, from the second the third, from the third the fourth, from\nthe fourth the fifth, and from the fifth this one.'\n\n8:6:3:22\\. They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how there may be success here for\nus!' They spake, 'Meditate ye ( _k_ it)!' whereby, indeed, they meant to say,\n'Seek ye a layer ( _k_ iti)! seek ye whereby there may be success here for\nus!'\n\n8:6:3:33\\. Whilst meditating, they said this: 'Let us bring this one here and\nput it on (the fire-altar)!' Having brought this (Garhapatya) here, they put\nit\n\np. 118\n\non. They disputed about it:--in the front part (of the fifth layer) the Vasus,\non the right side the Rudras, on the hind part the \xc3\x82dityas, on the left side\nthe Maruts, and above it the Vi _s_ ve Devas said. 'Here let us lay it down!\nhere. let us lay it down!'\n\n8:6:3:44\\. They spake, 'Let us lay it down in the middle: when laid down in\nour midst, it will belong to all of us.' They laid it down in the middle (of\nthe fifth layer), and thus they laid that success into the self (or the body\nof the altar);--in the middle (they laid it): they thus laid that success into\nthe very middle of (Agni's and their own) self. And in like manner does the\nSacrificer, when he lays down the Garhapatya, lay that success into (his own)\nself; and (by laying it down) in the middle, he lays that success into the\nvery middle of the self.\n\n8:6:3:55\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Garhapatya. The Garhapatya,\ndoubtless, is food, and this built Agni is an eater: it is to the eater he\nthus offers that food;--in the centre (he lays down the Garhapatya): in the\nvery middle (of the body) he thus lays food into him.\n\n8:6:3:66\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Garhapatya. The world of the\ngods, doubtless, is the Vedi (altar-ground); but that (original Garhapatya) is\nbuilt up outside the Vedi: thus, when he brings it here and lays it down (on\nthe fire-altar), he then establishes it (or him, Agni) on the Vedi, in the\nworld of the gods.\n\n8:6:3:77\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Garhapatya. The lotus-leaf\n1, doubtless, is a womb, but\n\np. 119\n\nthat (Garhapatya) is built up outside the womb, and outside of the womb indeed\ntakes place that performance regarding the fire-altar which takes place prior\nto the (laying down of the) lotus-leaf: thus, when they bring it (the\nGarhapatya) here and lay it down, he then establishes it in the womb. on the\nlotus-leaf; and thus indeed it is not outside. Eight bricks he lays down: the\nsignificance of this has been explained 1. He builds it up with the same\nformulas and in the same order, for this one is the same as that (former\nGarhapatya Agni) he thus brings it (or him) here and lays it down.\n\n8:6:3:88\\. He then lays down the Puna _s_ _k_ iti 2. Now at that time the\ngods, having built the Garhapatya, did not find success therein; for the\nGarhapatya pile is a womb, and success in a womb consists in seed, in\ngenerative power; and in this womb they saw no seed, no generative power.\n\n8:6:3:99\\. They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how we may lay seed and generative\npower into this womb!' They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed, they meant\nto say, 'Seek ye a layer! seek ye that we may lay seed and generative power\ninto this womb!'\n\n8:6:3:1010\\. Whilst meditating, they saw this Puna _s_ _k_ iti, and put it on\n(the Garhapatya), and thereby laid seed and generative power into this\nwomb;--in the centre (they placed it): they thus laid seed and\n\np. 120\n\ngenerative power into the very middle of this womb. And in like manner does\nthe Sacrificer now, when he lays down the Puna _s_ _k_ iti, lay seed and\ngenerative power into this womb;--in the centre (he lays it down): he thus\nlays seed and generative power into the very middle of this womb.\n\n8:6:3:1111\\. Now some lay it down on the hind part (of the bird-like altar),\nbecause it is from the hind part that seed is introduced,--(to wit) on the\njuncture of the tail (and the body), for it is from (the part near) the tail\nthat seed is introduced. Let him not do this, for they who do this lay seed\nand generative power outside the womb; but let him rather place it in the\ncentre: he thus lays seed and generative power right into the womb.\n\n8:6:3:1212\\. He lays down eight bricks,--the Gayatri (metre) consists of eight\nsyllables, and Agni (the fire-altar) is of Gayatri nature: as great as Agni\nis, as great as is his measure, so great he thus introduces him in the form of\nseed. Five times he 'settles' it,--of five layers consists the fire-altar,\nfive seasons make a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great\nas is his measure, by so much he thus introduces him in the form of seed.\nEight bricks he 'settles' five times, that makes thirteen,--thirteen months\nmake a year, and there are thirteen 'layer-fillings' of the altar: as great as\nAgni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus becomes.\n\n8:6:3:1313\\. And as to why he lays down the Puna _s_ _k_ iti. Now, in laying\ndown the Garhapatya (hearth) upon the \xc3\x82havaniya, he surely does what is\nimproper; but when he lays down the Puna _s_ _k_ iti he thereby brings this\nAgni (or altar) that has been built, and builds it up again thereon; and\nbecause he again\n\np. 121\n\n[paragraph continues] (punas) builds up ( _k_ i) that (Agni) already built,\ntherefore (this is called) Puna _s_ _k_ iti.\n\n8:6:3:1414\\. Now some lay down the Garhapatya on the hind part, and the Puna\n_s_ _k_ iti on the front part (of the built altar), for these two are the\n\xc3\x82havaniya and the Garhapatya, and these two fires are (placed) in this way 1.\nLet him not do this, for the Garhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and the\n\xc3\x82havaniya is the sky; and above this (earth) surely is yonder (sky); let him\ntherefore place it (the Puna _s_ _k_ iti) on the top of that (Garhapatya).\n\n8:6:3:1515\\. And as to why he lays down both the Garhapatya and the Puna _s_\n_k_ iti. These two, doubtless, are the Vedi and the Uttaravedi (high-altar) of\nAgni. Now those two former (altars of this kind) which he throws up 2 belong\nto the Soma-sacrifice, but these belong to the fire-altar; and when, after\nlaying down these two; he deposits Agni (the fire) thereon, then he\nestablishes him both on the Vedi and the Uttaravedi.\n\n8:6:3:1616\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Puna _s_ _k_ iti. This,\ndoubtless, is a repeated sacrifice (punarya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a), and higher (than the\nordinary sacrifice) is this worship of the gods: he thus sets up a repeated\nsacrifice, and the higher worship of the gods; and the repeated sacrifice\ninclines (accrues) to him.\n\n8:6:3:1717\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the\n\np. 122\n\n[paragraph continues] Puna _s_ _k_ iti. This (altar), doubtless, is that same\nAgni whom in the beginning the vital airs, the _Ri_ shis, made up 1. He now\nbuilds him up again; and inasmuch as he again (punas) builds up ( _k_ i) that\n(Agni) already built, therefore also it is (called) Puna _s_ _k_ iti.\n\n8:6:3:1818\\. [He lays down the first brick, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 49], 'With\nwhat fervour the _Ri_ shis entered upon the sacrificial session,'--he thereby\nmeans those _Ri_ shis (the vital airs);--'kindling the fire and gaining the\nlight,'--that is, 'kindling the fire, and gaining the heavenly world;'--'upon\nthat firmament I place the Fire,'--the firmament, doubtless, is the heavenly\nworld;--'whom thinkers call the straw-spreader,'--the thinkers (or men) are\nthey who are wise; and 'straw-spreader' he says, because he (Agni) has ever\nthe (sacrificial) straw spread for him.\n\n8:6:3:1919\\. [The second brick, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 50], 'With our wives let\nus follow him, O gods! with our sons and brothers, or our golden treasures;'--\nthat is, 'let us follow him with our all;'--'gaining the firmament in the\nworld of righteousness;'--the firmament, doubtless, is the heavenly world:\nthus, 'gaining the heavenly world in the world of righteousness;'--'above the\nthird luminous back of the sky,'--for this, indeed, is the third luminous back\nof the sky where this (Agni) now burns 2.\n\np. 123\n\n8:6:3:2020\\. [The third brick, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 51], 'Unto the centre of\nspeech did he mount, the nimble,'--for this, indeed, is the centre of speech\nwhere he now is built up; and 'the nimble (bhura _n_ yu),' that is, 'the\nsustainer 1 (bhartar);'--'this Agni, the good lord, the heedful,'--that is,\n'this Agni, the lord of the good, the heeding one;'--'established upon the\nback of the earth, he the brilliant,'--that is, 'established on the back of\nthe earth, the shining one;'--'let him tread under foot any hostile!'--that\nis, 'let him tread under foot all evildoers.'\n\n8:6:3:2121\\. [The fourth brick, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 52], 'This Agni, the most\nmettlesome bestower of strength,'--that is, 'the most vigorous bestower of\nstrength; may he glow a thousandfold, unremitting,'--that is, 'may he shine a\nthousandfold, not unheedful;'--'blazing in the middle of the sea,'--the sea,\ndoubtless, means these worlds: thus, 'shining in these worlds;'--'go forth to\nthe divine abodes!'--that is, 'go forth to the heavenly world!'\n\n8:6:3:2222\\. [The fifth brick, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 53], 'Gather ye together!\ndraw ye nigh together!'--he thereby says to those _Ri_ shis, 'Gather ye him\ntogether! draw ye nigh to him together!'--'Make ye Agni's 2 paths to lead to\nthe gods!'--as the text so the meaning;--'making the parents\n\np. 124\n\nyoung again,'--the young parents, doubtless, are speech and mind, and these\ntwo fires also are speech and mind;--'in thee hath he spun out this thread,'--\nhe thereby means that thread (of the sacrifice) which has been spun out by the\n_Ri_ shis.\n\n8:6:3:2323\\. [The sixth brick, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 54], 'Awake, O Agni, and\nbe watchful!'--he thereby says to this Agni, 'Wake thou over this one 1, and\nwatch thou over him! Wish and fulfilment, meet ye and he together 2!'--as the\ntext, so the meaning;--'Upon this, the higher seat,'--the higher seat,\ndoubtless, is the sky;--'sit ye down, O All-gods, and the Sacrificer!'--he\nthereby makes the Sacrificer sit down together with the Vi _s_ ve Devas.\n\n8:6:3:2424\\. [The seventh brick, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 55], 'Whereby thou\ncarriest a thousand, whereby, O Agni, all wealth,'--for that, indeed, is his\nmost acceptable power whereby he carries a thousand, and all wealth;--'thereby\nlead thou this sacrifice of ours unto the light to go to the gods!'--that is,\n'thereby lead thou this our sacrifice to the heavenly world to go to the\ngods.'--[The eighth brick, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 56], 'This is thy natural womb\n. . .;'--the meaning of this has been\n\np. 125\n\nexplained 1. Eight bricks he lays down: the meaning of this also has been\nexplained 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[117:1](sbe4325.htm#fr_213) For the building of the separate Garhapatya\nhearth, on which the sacred fire was transferred from the Ukha (fire-pan), see\npart iii, p. 298 seq.; its sketch, p. 302. A similar hearth is now built on\nthe fifth layer of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire-altar.\n\n[118:1](sbe4325.htm#fr_214) For the lotus-leaf, which is the first thing laid\ndown in the centre p. 119 of the altar-site on which the (\xc3\x82havaniya) altar is\nto be raised, see VII, 4, 1, 7 seqq. The Garhapatya had been built previous to\nthat (VII, 1, 1, 1 seqq.).\n\n[119:1](sbe4325.htm#fr_215) See VII, 1, 1, 19 seqq.\n\n[119:2](sbe4325.htm#fr_216) The Puna _s_ _k_ iti (re-piling) is a second pile\nor layer of eight bricks corresponding exactly to the first, and placed\nthereon.\n\n[121:1](sbe4325.htm#fr_217) In the ordinary sacrifices the Garhapatya hearth\nis placed behind (west of), and the \xc3\x82havaniya on the front (or east) end of,\nthe Vedi.\n\n[121:2](sbe4325.htm#fr_218) That is, at the performance of an ordinary Soma-\nsacrifice. For the vedi and uttaravedi on that occasion, see III, 5, 1, 1\nseq.; 12 seqq. (part ii, p. 111 seqq.)\n\n[122:1](sbe4325.htm#fr_219) See part iii, p. 143.\n\n[122:2](sbe4325.htm#fr_220) That is, on this altar where the fire will soon be\nburning. It seems also to refer to the sun burning over the third heaven--as\nthe counterpart of the Agni of the fire-altar.\n\n[123:1](sbe4325.htm#fr_221) That is, the sustainer of the world ( _g_ agad-\nbhartar), according to Mahidhara; an etymological play on the word 'bhura _n_\nyu.'\n\n[123:2](sbe4325.htm#fr_222) The texts have 'agne,' O Agni! the verbal form 'k\n_ri_ _n_ udhvam' being explained by Mahidhara as an irregular singular form\nfor 'k _ri_ _n_ u,' (make thou). The verse seems, however, corrupt.\n\n[124:1](sbe4325.htm#fr_223) The author (not Mahidhara) seems rather to take\n'udbudhyasva' in a transitive sense ('wake thou him'), as Mahidhara certainly\ndoes the second imperative 'prati _g_ ag _ri_ hi,' 'make him (the Sacrificer)\ncareful!'\n\n[124:2](sbe4325.htm#fr_224) The text has the 2nd person dual, which Mahidhara\nexplains by the 3rd dual (ya _g_ amanena saha sa _m_ s _ri_ sh _t_ e\nbhavatam--'May the two become united with the Sacrificer'), because of the\nnominative 'ish _t_ apurve,' instead of the vocative.\n\n[125:1](sbe4325.htm#fr_225) Viz.
