How can we say  \nWe followed Rama on his way.  \nThe mighty chief whose arm is strong,  \nWho sweetly speaks, who thinks no wrong?  \nAyodhya's town with sorrow dumb,  \nWithout our lord will see us come,  \nAnd hopeless misery will strike  \nElder, and child, and dame alike.  \nForth with that peerless chief we came,  \nWhose mighty heart is aye the same:  \nHow, reft of him we love, shall we  \nRetuming dare that town to see?'  \n   Complaining thus with varied cry  \nThey tossed their aged arms on high.  \nAnd their sad hearts with grief were wrung.  \nLike cows who sorrow for their young.  \nA while they followed on the road  \nWhich traces of his chariot showed,  \nBut when at length those traces failed,  \nA deep despair their hearts assailed.  \n\np. 150  \n\nThe chariot marks no more discerned,  \nThe hopeless sages backward turned:  \n'Ah, what is this? What can we more?  \nFate stops the way, and all is o'er.'  \nWith wearied hearts, in grief and shame  \nThey took the road by which they came,  \nAnd reached Ayodhya's city, where  \nFrom side to side was naught but care.  \nWith troubled spirits quite cast down  \nThey looked upon the royal town,  \nAnd from their eyes, oppressed with woe,  \nTheir tears again began to flow.  \nOf Rama reft, the city wore  \nNo look of beauty as before,  \nLike a dull river or a lake  \nBy Garud robbed of every snake.  \nDark, dismal as the moonless sky,  \nOr as a sea whose bed is dry,  \nSo sad, to every pleasure dead,  \nThey saw the town, disquieted.  \nOn to their houses, high and vast,  \nWhere stores of precious wealth were massed,  \nThe melancholy Brahmans passed,  \n   Their hearts with anguish cleft:  \nAloof from all, they came not near  \nTo stranger or to kinsman dear,  \nShowing in faces blank and drear  \n   That not one joy was left.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[149:1](ry125.htm#fr_320) The great pilgrimage to the Himalayas, in order to\ndie there.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLVIII.: The Women's Lament.](ry126.htm)\n\n"
