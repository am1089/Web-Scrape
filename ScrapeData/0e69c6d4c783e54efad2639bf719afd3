We have sent forward [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:1:1) with thoughtful mind\nthis song of praise like a chariot to the worthy _G_ atavedas. For blissful is\nhis care for us in his companionship. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy\nfriendship.\n\n2\\. He prospers for whom thou performest the sacrifice; he dwells untouched\n[1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:2:1); he acquires abundance of heroes. He is strong;\nno distress overtakes him. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.\n\n3\\. May we be able to light thee. Prosper our prayers. The gods eat the\nsacrificial food that is offered in thee. Bring thou hither the \xc3\x82dityas, for\nwe long for them. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.\n\n4\\. Let us bring fuel and prepare sacrificial gifts for thee, awaking thy\nattention at each joint [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:4:1) (of the month). Help\nforward our prayers that we may live. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy\nfriendship.\n\n5\\. (He is) the shepherd of the clans [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:5:1); by his\nnightly light the creatures walk, the two-footed and four-footed. Thou art the\nbright, great splendour of dawn. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy\nfriendship.\n\n6\\. Thou art the Adhvaryu and the ancient Hot _ri_ , the Pra _s_ ast _ri_\n[1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:6:1), the Pot _ri_ , the born Purohita\n[2](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:6:2). Knowing the duties of every priest thou givest\n\np. 109\n\nsuccess, O wise one. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.\n\n7\\. Thou who art beautiful, of like appearance on all sides, thou shinest\nforth even when afar like lightning. Thou seest, O god, even over the darkness\nof night. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.\n\n8\\. May the chariot of him who presses Soma, be to the front\n[1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:8:1), O gods. May our curse overcome the malicious\nones. Accept (O gods) this prayer and make it prosper. Agni! May we suffer no\nharm in thy friendship.\n\n9\\. Strike away with thy weapons those who curse us, the malicious ones, all\nghouls, be they near or afar. And make a good path to the sacrifice of him who\npraises thee. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.\n\n10\\. When thou hast yoked to thy chariot the two ruddy, red horses, whom the\nwind drives forward, and thy roaring is like that of a bull, then thou movest\nthe trees with thy banner of smoke [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:10:1). Agni! May\nwe suffer no harm in thy friendship.\n\n11\\. And when thy grass-consuming sparks are scattered, the winged (birds)\n[1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:11:1) also fear the noise. Then all goes well with\nthee and thy chariots. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.\n\n12\\. He makes Mitra and Varu _n_ a get refreshing drink. He mysteriously turns\naway the anger of the Maruts [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:12:1). Be merciful\ntowards us. May their mind be again (as it was before). Agni! May we suffer no\nharm in thy friendship.\n\n13\\. Thou art god of the gods, a wonderful Mitra (i. e. friend, of the gods)\n[1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:13:1). Thou art the Vasu\n\np. 110\n\nof the Vasus, welcome at the sacrifice. May we be under thy most wide-reaching\nprotection. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.\n\n14\\. That is thy glorious (nature) that when kindled in thy own house, and fed\nwith Soma, thou art awake [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:14:1), the most merciful\none. Thou bestowest treasures and wealth on the worshipper. Agni! May we\nsuffer no harm in thy friendship.\n\n15\\. May we be of those to whom thou, O possessor of beautiful wealth, O Aditi\n[1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:15:1), art pleased to grant sinlessness in health and\nwealth [2](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:15:2), and whom thou wilt quicken with\nglorious strength and with abundance of progeny.\n\n16\\. Do thou, O Agni, thou who knowest (how to grant) happiness, prolong our\nlife here, O God! May Mitra and Varu _n_ a grant us this, may Aditi, the\nSindhu, the Earth, and the Sky [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:16:1)!\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn with the whole collection which it opens is ascribed to Kutsa\n\xc3\x82\xe1\xb9\x85girasa. The metre is _G_ agati; the two last verses, as is frequently the\ncase in _G_ agati-hymns (see H. O., Prolegomena, 144 seq.), are composed in\nTrish _t_ ubh. The hymn has been translated by Prof. Max Muller, Physical\nReligion, p. 173.--Verse 1 = MS. II, 7, 3; SV. I, 66; AV. XX, 13, 3. Verses I,\n3, 4 = SV. II, 414. 416. 415.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Prof. Max Muller translates, 'Let us build up this hymn of praise.' To\nme it rather seems that the reading should be, as Boehtlingk-Roth have\nproposed, s. v. sam-hi, sam ahema. Comp. I, 61, 4. asmai it u stomam sam\n\np. 111\n\nhinoini ratham na tash _t_ a-iva, 'to him I send forward a song of praise as a\ncarpenter (fits out) a chariot.' Compare besides, IX, 71, 5; I, 184, 4; II,\n19, 7; VI, 45, 14, &c.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Comp. vol. xxxii, p. 65, I, 37, 1 note.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Parvan, 'joint,' seems to refer here, as it very frequently does in\nthe later Vedic and post-Vedic texts, to the joints of the month, the\nsacrificial days of the full and change of the moon (the parva _n_\na-sacrifices). As to the temporal use of the instrumental, comp. _ri_ tuna and\n_ri_ tubhi _h_ ; Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, p. 130.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Ludwig proposes the correction of vi _s_ a\xc2\xb4m gopa\xc2\xb4 _h_ into vi _s_ a\xc2\xb4m\ngopa _h_ (genitive). But I think it will be sufficient to write asya accented.\nAs to vi _s_ a\xc2\xb4m gopa\xc2\xb4 _h_ , comp. 96, 4.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The Pra _s_ ast _ri_ (or Upavakt _ri_ ), literally, 'the commander,'\nis the same priest who is more usually designated as the Maitravaru _n_ a. All\nthe priests mentioned here (with the exception of the Purohita, see next note)\nbelong to the ancient system of the 'seven Hot _ri_ s,' enumerated, for\ninstance, II, 1, 2. Comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, 383 seq.\n\nNote 2. The Purohita or house-priest does not, properly speaking, belong to\nthe number of the priests officiating at a sacrifice ( _ri_ tvi _g_ a _h_ ),\nthough of course the Purohita could act as a _ri_ tvi _g_. Geldner (Vedische\nStudien, II, 144) seems to be wrong in concluding from our passage that\n'already in the Rig-veda the Purohita, being the superintendent of the holy\nservice, was a real _ri_ tvi _g_ , i. e. officiating priest.' Comp. H. O.,\nloc. cit., 374 Seq.; 379, note 2.\n\np. 112\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. On pu\xc2\xb4rva _h_ , comp. I, 34, 10; V, 31, 11.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. The regular accentuation of a determinative compound ('banner of\nsmoke') would be dhumaketuna. But it is very natural that the traditional text\ngives the accent of the Bahuvrihi ('he whose banner is smoke') which so\nfrequently occurs.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. As to patatri _n_ a _h_ , comp. above, I, 58, 5.\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. Most probably the meaning is not that the Maruts are expected to turn\naway the anger of somebody else, but that the anger of the Maruts shall be\nturned away by Agni, Comp. I, 171, I; VI, 66, 5; VII, 58, 5; Bergaigne,\nReligion Vedique, II, 401. It seems, consequently, that we should read\navayata\xc2\xb4.--On avayatahe _l_ a _h_ , scil. Indra, see vol. xxxii, p. 292 (I,\n171, 6), and also IV, 1, 4; VI, 66, 5.\n\nThe genitives Mitrasya Varu _n_ asya may be understood as depending, together\nwith Marutam, on he _l_ a _h_. In this case the translation would be: 'He\nmysteriously turns away the anger of Mitra and Varu _n_ a and of the Maruts in\norder that (men) may get refreshing drink.'\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. On the frequent identification of Agni with Mitra, see Bergaigne,\nReligion Vedique, III, 134 seq.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. On the root _g_ ar used with regard to Agni, see the remarks of Dr.\nNeisser in Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XIII, 297 seq.\n\np. 113\n\n##### Verse 15.\n\nNote 1. Agni is invoked here by the name of Aditi, with an evident allusion to\nthe goddess Aditi, as granting freedom from bonds, which is the original\nmeaning of Aditi. Comp. M. M., vol. xxxii, pp. 241, 260, 262; H. O., Religion\ndes Veda, p. 204.\n\nNote 2. Comp. III, 54, 19. On sarvatat (sarvatati), see M. M.'s note, vol.\nxxxii, p. 260, note a, and compare Darmesteter, Haurvata _t_ et Amereta _t_ ,\np. 80. See also Lanman, p. 386.\n\n##### Verse 16.\n\nNote 1. The last hemistich is the regular conclusion of the Kutsa hymns.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 95](sbe46031.htm)\n\n"
