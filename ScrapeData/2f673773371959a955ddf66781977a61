I sprinkle  \nthee agreeable to Agni.  \nThou art the altar. Thee welcome to the sacred grass I  \nsprinkle.  \nThou art the sacred covering-grass. I sprinkle thee grateful  \nto the sacrificial ladles.  \n2 Thou art what giveth Aditi her moisture. Thou art the  \nhair-tuft on the head of Vishnu. I spread thee, wool-soft,  \ngood for Gods to sit on.  \nHail to the Earth's Lord! To the World's Lord Hail! Hail  \nto the Lord of Beings!  \n3 For safety of this all let the Gandharva Visvavasu lay thee  \nround as a protection. Thou art the Sacrificer's guard,  \nthou, Agni, lauded and worthy to receive laudation.  \nIndra's right arm art thou. For safety . . . . . . laudation.  \nFor safety of This Ail, with firm law, northward let Mitra.  \nVaruna lay thee round as keeper. Thou art the Sacrificer's  \nguard . . . . . . laudation.  \n4 Thee, Sage, who offerest to Gods their banquet, we will  \nenkindle till thou shinest brightly, thee mighty in the  \nsacrifice, O Agni.\n\np. 10\n\n5 Thou art a kindler. From the east let Surya keep thee  \nsecure from every imprecation.  \nYou are the arms of Savitar. I spread thee as soft as wool,  \ngood for the Gods to sit on. On thee sit Vasus, Rudras,  \nand \xc3\x82dityas!  \n6 Thou who art called Juhu art rich in fatness. On this dear  \nseat, with the dear home, be seated.  \nThou, Upabhrit by name, art rich in fatness. On this . . . . . . . .  \nbe seated.  \nThou who art called Dhruva, art rich in fatness. On this, etc.  \nIn the Law's lap they have sat down in safety  \nGuard these. Guard thou the Sacrifice, O Vishnu. Keep  \nthou the Sacrifice's Lord in safety.  \n7 O Agni, Winner of the Spoil, I cleanse thee, thee who wilt  \nhasten to the spoil, Spoil-winner.  \nObeisance to the Gods! Svadha to Fathers! Be both of you  \neasy for me to handle.  \n8 May I to-day offer Gods unspilt butter. Let me not with  \nmy foot offend thee, Vishnu.  \nAgni, may I approach thy shade abounding in store of riches.  \nThou art Vishnu's mansion,  \nHence Indra wrought his deed of manly vigour. The sacrifice  \nstood firmly elevated.\n\np. 11\n\n9 O Agni, undertake the Hotar's office, take on thyself the  \nduty of an envoy.  \nHeaven and Earth guard thee! Guard thou Earth and Heaven.  \nMay Indra be, by this presented butter, maker to Gods of  \nfair oblation. Svaha! Let light combine with light.  \n10 Indra bestow on me that Indra-power! May wealth in full  \nabundance gather round us. Let blessings wait on us,  \nyea, real blessings.  \nOur Mother, Earth, hath been invited hither. May Earth,  \nour Mother, in return invite us. I, through my Kindlership,  \nam Agni. Svaha!  \n11 The Father Heaven hath been invited hither. May Heaven  \nthe Father in return invite us.  \nBy impulse of God Savitar I receive thee with arms of  \nAsvins, with the hands of Pushan. I feed upon thee  \nwith the mouth of Agni.  \n12 God Savitar, this sacrifice of thine have they proclaimed  \nunto Brihaspati the Brahman Priest.  \nTherefore protect the sacrifice, protect the sacrifice's lord,  \nprotect thou me.  \n13 The butter's rapid flow delight his spirit! Brihaspati extend  \nthis act of worship. May he restore the sacrifice uninjured.  \nHere let all Gods rejoice. OM! Step thou forward.  \n14 This is the stick for kindling thee, O Agni. By means of  \nthis grow strong and swell to greatness. May we too grow  \nin strength and swell to greatness.  \nO Agni, thou who winnest food, I cleanse thee, thee who  \nhast hastened to the food, Food-winner.\n\np. 12\n\n15 After the victory of Agni Soma may I obtain the victory.  \nBy impulse of sacrificial food I speed me onward.  \nMay Agni-Soma drive off him who hates us, drive off the  \nman whom we detest. By impulse of sacrificial food away  \nI drive him.  \nAfter the victory of Indra-Agni may I obtain the victory.  \nBy impulse of sacrificial food I speed me forward.  \nMay Indra-Agni . . . . . . I drive him.  \n16 For Vasus thee. For Rudras thee. Thee for \xc3\x82dityas.  \nBe, Heaven and Earth, accordant with each other. With  \nrain may Mitra-Varuna assist thee.  \nMay the birds go, licking what is anointed.  \nGo to the Maruts\xc2\x92 speckled mares. Go, having become a  \nspeckled cow thyself, to heaven, and from that place bring  \nthe rain for us hither.  \nThou art the eye's guard: guard mine eye, O Agni.  \nI7 The stick which thou, God Agni, laidest round thee, what  \ntime thou wast kept hidden by the Panis, this do I bring  \nto thee for thine enjoyment. May it remain with thee  \nand ne\xc2\x92er be fruitless.  \nApproach, ye two, the place which Agni loveth.  \n18 The residue ye have to be your portion, mighty by food, ye  \nGods, ye who are stationed on the grass-bunch, and to be  \nlaid as fences.  \nAll ye, applauding this my speech, be seated on this grass-bunch  \nand there be joyful. Svaha! Vat!\n\np. 13\n\n19 Rich in oil are ye. Guard the two yoke-fellows. Ye two  \nare full of grace, to grace conduct me.  \nGlory to thee, O Sacrifice, and increase! Stand firm in my  \nauspicious, righteous worship.  \n20 O Agni of unweakened strength, far-reaching, protect me  \nfrom the lightning-flash, protect me from bondage. from  \ndefect in sacrificing, from food injurious to health protect  \nme.  \nMake thou the food that feeds us free from poison in the  \nhome good to sit in. Svaha! Vat!  \nHail to the Lord of close embracements, Agni! Hail to Sarasvati  \nenriched with glory!  \n21 Veda art thou, whereby, O godlike Veda, thou hast become  \nfor Deities their Veda: thereby mayst thou become for  \nme a Veda.  \nO Deities, ye knowers of the Pathway, walk on the pathway  \nhaving known the Pathway.  \nGod, Lord of Spirit, hail! bestow upon the Wind this sacrifice.  \n22 Blest be the Grass with sacred food and butter. Let Indra  \nbe united with the \xc3\x82dityas, the Vasus, Maruts, and the  \nVisvedevas. Let Svaha-offerings rise to heavenly ether.\n\np. 14\n\n23 Who liberates thee from the yoke? He frees thee. For whom?  \nFor him he looses thee. For plenty.  \nThou art the Rakshasas\xc2\x92 allotted portion.  \n24 We have combined with lustre, vigour, bodies; we have  \nunited with the blessed spirit. May Tvashtar, bounteous  \ngiver, grant us riches, and clear each fault and blemish  \nfrom the body.  \n25 By Jagati metre in the sky strode Vishnu. Therefrom excluded  \nis the man who hates us and whom we detest.  \nBy Trishtup metre in the air strode Vishnu. Therefrom, etc.  \nBy Gayatri upon the earth strode Vishnu. Therefrom, etc.  \nFrom this food From this resting-place excluded.  \nWe have reached heaven. We have combined with lustre.  \n26 Thou, noblest ray of light, art Self-existent. Giver art thou  \nof splendour. Give me splendour.  \nI move along the path that Surya travels.  \n27 Agni, may I become a good householder, through thee,  \nHome-master, O Householder Agni. Mayst thou become  \nan excellent Householder through me the master of the  \nhouse, O Agni.  \nThrough hundred winters may our household matters\xc2\x97not  \nlike a one-ox car\xc2\x97be smoothly managed.  \nI move along the path that Surya travels.  \n28 I have performed the vow, Lord of Vows, Agni! Full power  \nwas mine, and it has proved successful.  \nNow am I he I truly am, no other.\n\np. 15\n\n29 To Agni Hail! who bears gifts due to Sages. To Soma Hail!  \naccompanied by Fathers.  \nExpelled are Asuras and fiends who sate upon the covering  \ngrass.  \n30 The Asuras, attracted by oblation, who roam at will assuming  \nvaried figures, from this our world may Agni drive  \nthem, whether they clothe themselves in large or little  \nbodies.  \n31 O Fathers, here enjoy yourselves. Come hither, like bulls,  \ncome each to his allotted portion.  \nThe Fathers have enjoyed themselves, and hither, like bulls,  \ncome each to his allotted portion.  \n32 Obeisance to your genial sap, O Fathers! Fathers, obeisance  \nunto you for Ardour! Fathers, obeisance Onto you for  \nSvadha! Obeisance unto you for Life, O Fathers!  \nFathers, to you obeisance for the Awful! Fathers, obeisance  \nunto you for Passion! O Fathers, unto you be adoration.  \nBestow upon us houses, O ye Fathers, what is ours, O  \nFathers, will we give you. With this your raiment clothe  \nyourselves, O Fathers.  \n33 Fathers, bestow on me a babe, a boy enwreathed with  \nlotuses, so that there may be here a man.\n\np. 16\n\n34 Bearers of vigour and immortal fatness, milk and sweet beverage  \nand foaming liquor, ye are a freshening draught.  \nDelight my Fathers.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book III](wyvbk03.htm)\n\n"
