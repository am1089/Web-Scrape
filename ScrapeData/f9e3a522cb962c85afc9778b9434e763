Now, therefore, we will declare the acts productive of merit which form\npart of the customs of daily life, as they have been settled by the agreement\n(of those who know the law). 1\n\n2\\. The authority (for these duties) is the agreement of those who know the\nlaw, 2\n\n3\\. And (the authorities for the latter are) the Vedas alone.\n\n4\\. (There are) four castes--Brahma _n_ as, Kshatriyas, Vai _s_ yas, and _S_\nudras.\n\n5\\. Amongst these, each preceding (caste) is superior by birth to the one\nfollowing.\n\n6\\. (For all these), excepting _S_ udras and those who have committed bad\nactions, (are ordained) the initiation, the study of the Veda, and the\nkindling of 6\n\np. 2\n\nthe sacred fire; and (their) works are productive of rewards (in this world\nand the next).\n\n7\\. To serve the other (three) castes (is ordained) for the _S_ udra. 7\n\n8\\. The higher the caste (which he serves) the greater is the merit.\n\n9\\. The initiation is the consecration in accordance with the texts of the\nVeda, of a male who is desirous of (and can make use of) sacred knowledge. 9\n\n10\\. A Brahma _n_ a declares that the Gayatri is learnt for the sake of all\nthe (three) Vedas. 10\n\n11\\. (Coming) out of darkness, he indeed enters darkness, whom a man unlearned\nin the Vedas, initiates, and (so does he) who, without being learned in the\nVedas, (performs the rite of initiation.) That has been declared in a Brahma\n_n_ a.\n\n12\\. As performer of this rite of initiation he shall seek to obtain a man in\nwhose family sacred learning is hereditary, who himself possesses it, and who\nis devout (in following the law).\n\n13\\. And under him the sacred science must be 13\n\np. 3\n\nstudied until the end, provided (the teacher) does not fall off from the\nordinances of the law.\n\n14\\. He from whom (the pupil) gathers (a _k_ inoti) (the knowledge of) his\nreligious duties (dharman) (is called) the \xc3\x82 _k_ arya (teacher). 14\n\n15\\. Him he should never offend. 15\n\n16\\. For he causes him (the pupil) to be born (a second time) by (imparting to\nhim) sacred learning. 16\n\n17\\. This (second) birth is the best. 17\n\n18\\. The father and the mother produce the body only. 18\n\n19\\. Let him initiate a Brahma _n_ a in spring, a Kshatriya in summer, a Vai\n_s_ ya in autumn, a Brahma _n_ a in the eighth year after conception, a\nKshatriya in the eleventh year after conception, (and) a Vai _s_ ya in the\ntwelfth after conception. 19\n\n20\\. Now (follows the enumeration of the years\n\np. 4\n\nto be chosen) for the fulfilment of some (particular) wish,\n\n21\\. (Let him initiate) a person desirous of excellence in sacred learning in\nhis seventh year, 21\n\n22\\. A person desirous of long life in his eighth year, 22\n\n23\\. A person desirous of manly vigour in his ninth year,\n\n24\\. A person desirous of food in his tenth year,\n\n25\\. A person desirous of strength in his eleventh year,\n\n26\\. A person desirous of cattle in his twelfth year.\n\n27\\. There is no dereliction (of duty, if the initiation takes place), in the\ncase of a Brahma _n_ a before the completion of the sixteenth year, in the\ncase of a Kshatriya before the completion of the twenty-second year, in the\ncase of a Vai _s_ ya before the completion of the twenty-fourth year. (Let him\nbe initiated at such an age) that he may be able to perform the duties, which\nwe shall declare below. 27\n\n28\\. If the proper time for the initiation has passed, he shall observe for\nthe space of two months 28\n\np. 5\n\nthe duties of a student, as observed by those who are studying the three\nVedas.\n\n29\\. After that he may be initiated.\n\n30\\. After that he shall bathe (daily) for one year. 30\n\n31\\. After that he may be instructed.\n\n32\\. He, whose father and grandfather have not been initiated, (and his two\nancestors) are called 'slayers of the Brahman.' 32\n\n33\\. Intercourse, eating, and intermarriage with them should be avoided. 33\n\n34\\. If they wish it (they may perform the following) expiation;\n\n35\\. In the same manner as for the first neglect (of the initiation, a penance\nof) two months (was) prescribed, so (they shall do penance for) one year. 35\n\n36\\. Afterwards they may be initiated, and then they must bathe (daily),\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](sbe0204.htm#fr_110) **1**. Samaya, 'agreement, decision,' is threefold.\nIt includes injunction, restriction, and prohibition.\n\nDharma, 'acts productive of merit, I usually translated by 'duty or law,' is\nmore accurately explained as an act which produces the quality of the soul\ncalled apurva, the cause of heavenly bliss and of final liberation.\n\n[1:2](sbe0204.htm#fr_111) Manu II, 6, 12 Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 7; Gautama I, 1.\n\n[1:6](sbe0204.htm#fr_112) Manu II, 35.\n\n[2:7](sbe0204.htm#fr_113) Manu 1, 91, VIII, 410; and IX, 334; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I,\n120.\n\n[2:9](sbe0204.htm#fr_114) The use of the masculine in the text excludes women.\nFor though women may have occasion to use such texts as 'O fire, of the\ndwelling' &c. at the Agnihotra, still it is specially ordained that they shall\nbe taught this and similar verses only just before the rite is to be\nperformed.\n\n[2:10](sbe0204.htm#fr_115) The object of the Sutra is to remove a doubt\nwhether the ceremony of initiation ought to be repeated for each Veda, in case\na man desires to study more than one Veda. This repetition is declared to be\nunnecessary, except, as the commentator adds, in the case of the Atharva-veda,\nfor which, according to a passage of a Brahma _n_ a, a fresh initiation is\nnecessary. The latter rule is given in the Vaitana-sutra I, 1, 5.\n\n[2:13](sbe0204.htm#fr_116) Haradatta: 'But this (latter rule regarding the\ntaking of p. 3 another teacher) does not hold good for those who have begun to\nstudy, solemnly, binding themselves, to their teacher. How so? As he (the\npupil) shall consider a person who initiates and instructs him his \xc3\x82 _k_ arya,\nand a pupil who has been once initiated cannot be initiated again, how can\nanother man instruct him? For this reason it must be understood that the study\nbegun with one teacher may not be completed with another, if the first die.'\nCompare also Haradatta on I, 2, 7, 26, and the rule given I, 1, 4, 26. In our\ntimes also pupils, who have bound themselves to a teacher by paying their\nrespects to him and presenting a cocoa-nut, in order to learn from him a\nparticular branch of science, must not study the same branch of science under\nany other teacher.\n\n[3:14](sbe0204.htm#fr_117) Manu II, 69; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 15.\n\n[3:15](sbe0204.htm#fr_118) Manu II, 144.\n\n[3:16](sbe0204.htm#fr_119) Manu II, 146-148.\n\n[3:17](sbe0204.htm#fr_120) 'Because it procures heavenly bliss and final\nliberation.'--Haradatta.\n\n[3:18](sbe0204.htm#fr_121) Manu II, 147.\n\n[3:19](sbe0204.htm#fr_122) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 14; Manu II, 36; \xc3\x82 _s_ vakayana G\n_ri_. Su. I, 19, 1, 4: Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 20 seq.\n\n[4:21](sbe0204.htm#fr_123) Manu II, 37.\n\n[4:22](sbe0204.htm#fr_124)-26. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_. Su. I, 19, 5, 7; Weber, Ind.\nStud. X, 21.\n\n[4:27](sbe0204.htm#fr_125) The meaning of the Sutra is, that the initiation\nshall be performed as soon as the child is able to begin the study of the\nVeda. If it is so far developed at eight years, the ceremony must then be\nperformed; and if it be then neglected, or, if it be neglected at any time\nwhen the capacity for learning exists, expiation prescribed in the following\nSutras must be performed. The age of sixteen in the case of Brahma _n_ as is\nthe latest term up to which the ceremony may be deferred, in case of\nincapacity for study only. After the lapse of the sixteenth year, the\nexpiation becomes also necessary. Manu II, 38; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 37.\n\n[4:28](sbe0204.htm#fr_126) The meaning is, he shall keep all the restrictions\nimposed upon a student, as chastity, &c, but that he shall not perform the\nfire-worship or service to a teacher, nor study. Manu II, 39; XI. 192, Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_. I, 38; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 101.\n\n[5:30](sbe0204.htm#fr_127) 'If he is strong, he shall bathe three times a day\n--morning, midday, and evening.'--Haradatta.\n\n[5:32](sbe0204.htm#fr_128) Brahman, apparently, here means 'Veda,' and those\nwho neglect its study may be called metaphorically 'slayers of the Veda.'\n\n[5:33](sbe0204.htm#fr_129) Manu II, 40; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_. Su. I, 19, 8, 9;\nWeber, Ind. Stud. X, 21.\n\n[5:35](sbe0204.htm#fr_130) Compare above, I, 1, 1, 28.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 1, Kha _n_ _d_ a 2](sbe0205.htm)\n\n"
