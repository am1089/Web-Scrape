Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Devar _s_ i! The Sphere of Rahu (the ascending\nnode) is situated one Ayuta Yoyanas below the Sun. Rahu,\n\n\n\np. 780\n\n\n\nthe son of Simhika is moving there like a Nak _s_ attra. This Rahu swallows up\nboth the Sun and the Moon and He has got immortality and capability to travel\nin the sky. The Sun\xc2\x92s rays go up to one Ayuta Yoyanas. The Asura Rahu thus\ncovers his rays. So the sphere of the Moon extends upto the twelve thousand\nYoyanas. Rahu covers the field of the thirteen thousand Yoyanas. So he covers\nboth the Sun and the Moon. Desire to take the vengeance of the previous\nenmity, he covers them during the time of Parva (the festivals). This planet\nwants to cover them from a distance. Hearing this, the Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u\nhurls His Sudars\xc2\x92an Chakra against Rahu. This Chakra (disc) is encircled with\nthe fiery flames and is very terrible. When all the quarters were filled with\nits violent flames, Rahu became instantly alarmed and fled away from the\ndistance. O Devar _s_ i! This is known as the eclipse known amongst the\nmortals. Below the sphere of Rahu, there are the other pure Lokas situated. O\nSattama! The Siddhas, Chara _n_ as, and Vidyadharas live in those Lokas. Their\ndimensions are one Ayuta Yoyanas.\n\n\n\n10\\. O Devar _s_ i! Below them live the Yak _s_ as, Rak _s_ asas, Pis\xc2\x92achas,\nPretas and Bhutas with their excellent Viharas (residences).\n\n\n\n11-34. The learned people call this Antarik _s_ a. It extends upto where the\nwind blows violently and where the clouds appear. O Best of the twice-born!\nBelow this Antarik _s_ a is this earth, measuring one hundred Yoyanas. All the\narticles and things of the earth are found here; birds herons, cranes and\nducks all fly over the earth. The earth extends upto this. Now is described\nthe configuration of the earth. O Devar _s_ i! At the lower part of this earth\nthere are seven places (caves or nether regions). Their diameter is one Ayuta\nYoyanas. In all the seasons, all sorts of enjoyments can be had at these\nplaces. The first is Atala; the second is Vitala. Next come in order :--\nSutala, Talatala, Mahatala. Rasatala, and lastly (the seventh) the Patala. O\nVipra! Thus the seven holes or regions are reckoned. These are termed the\nVila-Svargas and they yield the happinesses, greater than those of the\nHeavens. These are all filled with lovely amorous enjoyments, prosperity and\nhappiness. They are crowded with gardens and Viharas (the places of\nenjoyments). And these Viharas are all decorated tastefully so as to furnish\nspecial tastes of enjoyments. The powerful Daityas, Danavas, and Snakes enjoy\nhere great happiness incessantly, united lovingly with their sons, wives and\nfriends. The householders also pass their time in ease and enjoyments,\nsurrounded by their friends and attendants. They are all Mayavis (Magicians)\nand their resolves are not thwarted; they are more than God in this respect\nand they are filled with desires. They all live with joy and in enjoyments and\nthey\n\n\n\np. 781\n\n\n\nfind pleasure in all the seasons. Maya, the Lord of Maya had built separate\ncities, as he liked, in those nether regions. Besides he has created thousands\nof dwelling-houses, palaces, and town-gates, studded with gems and jewels.\n\n\n\nThe assembly halls, Chatvaras, and Chaityas are elaborately decorated and rare\neven to the Suras. The Nagas and Asuras live in those houses with their\nconsorts; doves and pigeons and female Mayina birds are hovering there. In\nthose places many plots marked out artificially and excellent rows of palatial\nbuildings of the Lords of those Vivaras adorn there. Very big gardens also\nexist there. All these cheer the minds; and, to add to their beauty, many\nplaces of fruits and flowers are close by, fit for the comfort and enjoyments\nof the ladies. The tanks and pools of water are crowded with various birds;\nthe lakes are filled with clear waters and the Pa _t_ hina fishes abound\nthere. The aquatic animals move in the waters, violently agitating them.\nVarious kinds of lotuses, Kumud, Utpala, Kahlara, blue lotus, red lotus, are\nfully blown in these lakes or reservoirs of water. The gardens there are all\novercrowded with the Viharas of the inhabitants there and echoed with the\nsweet melodious music, pleasing to the senses. For there, these places seem to\nvie with the Heavens. No fear is there, whether during the day or during the\nnight. The gems on the crest of snakes constantly illumine the environments\nand there is no darkness there at any time. The food there is prepared with\nthe divine medicines and they drink and bathe with these medicinal plants; so\nno disease attacks them. Old age, fever, indigestion, paleness, sweats, bad\nsmells, or loss of energy or any other source of trouble cannot trouble them.\nThe people are always happy and good. Only they fear the Teja of the Bhagavan\nand His Sudars\xc2\x92an disc; and they fear nothing else. When the Teja of the\nBhagavan enters, the women\xc2\x92s abortions take place.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighteenth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the narrative of Rahu\nMa _nd_ alam in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses,\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 19](bk08ch19.htm)\n\n'
