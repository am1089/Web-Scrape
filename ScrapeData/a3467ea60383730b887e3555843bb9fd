Their mother (one of the most distant stars\nyou see far up in the sky) waited alone for her children\'s return.\n\nNow both the Sun and the Wind were greedy and selfish. They enjoyed the great\nfeast that had been prepared for them, without a thought of saving any of it\nto take home to their mother--but the gentle Moon did not forget her. Of every\ndainty dish that was brought round she placed a small portion under one of her\nbeautiful long finger-nails, that the Star might also have a share in the\ntreat.  1\n\nOn their return, their Mother, who had kept watch for them all night long with\nher little bright eye, said, \'Well, children, what have you brought home for\nme?\' Then the Sun (who was eldest) said, \'I have brought nothing home for you.\nI went out to enjoy myself with my friends--not to fetch a dinner for\nmymother!\' And the Wind said, \'Neither have I brought anything home for you,\nmother. You could hardly expect me to bring a collection of good things for\nyou, when I merely went out for my own pleasure.\' But the Moon said, \'Mother,\nfetch a plate, see what I have brought you.\' And shaking her hands she\nshowered down such a choice dinner as never was seen before.\n\nThen the Star turned to the Sun and spoke thus, \'Because you went out to amuse\nyourself with your friends, and feasted and enjoyed yourself, without any\nthought of your mother at home--you shall be cursed. Henceforth, your rays\nshall ever be hot and scorching, and shall burn all that they touch. And men\nshall hate you, and cover their heads when you appear.\'\n\n(And that is why the Sun is so hot to this day.)\n\nThen she turned to the Wind and said, \'You also, who forgot your mother in the\nmidst of your selfish pleasures--hear your doom. You shall always blow in the\nhot dry weather, and shall parch and shrivel all living things. And men shall\ndetest and avoid you from this very time.\'\n\n(And that is why the Wind in the hot weather is still so disagreeable.)\n\nBut to the Moon she said, \'Daughter, because you remembered your mother, and\nkept for her a share in your own enjoyment, from henceforth you shall be ever\ncool, and calm, and bright No noxious glare shall accompany your pure rays,\nand men shall always call you "blessed."\n\n(And that is why the Moon\'s light is so soft, and cool, and beautiful even to\nthis day.)\n\n![](img/24.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd14.htm#fr_57) See Notes.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI.
