Or an injunction, as in the case of the carrying.\n\nAs the second part of the text 'Let him approach carrying the firewood below\nthe ladle; for above he carries\n\np. 696\n\nit for the gods' (which refers to a certain form of the Agnihotra), although\nhaving the form of an anuvada, yet must be interpreted as an injunction, since\nthe carrying of firewood above is not established by any other injunction; so\nthe text under discussion also must be taken as an injunction of the different\nstages of life (which are not formally enjoined elsewhere). No account being\ntaken of the text of the _G_ abalas, 'Having completed his studentship he is\nto become a householder,' &c., it is thus a settled conclusion that the texts\ndiscussed, although primarily concerned with other topics, must at the same\ntime be viewed as proving the validity of the several conditions of life. From\nthis it follows that the text enjoining the performance of the Agnihotra up to\nthe end of life, and similar texts, are not universally binding, but concern\nthose only who do not retire from worldly life.--The final conclusion\ntherefore is that as the knowledge of Brahman is enjoined on those who lead a\nlife of austerity (which does not require the performance of sacrifices and\nthe like), it is not subordinate to works, but is in itself beneficial to man.\n--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'benefit to man.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 21.
