In qualifying\nthe changes as changes of 'Being,' you manifest great logical acumen indeed!\nFor according to your own view Nescience also (which is not 'Being') does not\noriginate, is the substrate of manifold changes, and comes to an end through\nthe rise of knowledge! Perhaps you will say that the changes of Nescience are\nall unreal. But, do you then, we ask in reply, admit that any change is real?\nYou do not; and yet it is only this admission which would give a sense to the\ndistinction expressed by the word 'Being' 1.\n\nNor is it true that consciousness does not admit of any division within\nitself, because it has no beginning ([p. 36](sbe48007.htm#page_36)). For the\nnon-originated Self is divided from the body, the senses, &c., and Nescience\nalso, which is avowedly without a beginning, must needs be admitted to be\ndivided from the Self. And if you say that the latter division is unreal, we\nask whether you have ever observed a real division invariably connected with\norigination! Moreover, if the distinction of Nescience from the Self is not\nreal, it follows that Nescience and the Self are essentially one. You further\nhave yourself proved the difference of views by means of the difference of the\nobjects of knowledge as established by non-refuted knowledge; an analogous\ncase\n\np. 55\n\nbeing furnished by the difference of acts of cleaving, which results from the\ndifference of objects to be cleft. And if you assert that of this knowing--\nwhich is essentially knowing only--nothing that is an object of knowledge can\nbe an attribute, and that these objects--just because they are objects of\nknowledge--cannot be attributes of knowing; we point out that both these\nremarks would apply also to eternity, self-luminousness, and the other\nattributes of 'knowing', which are acknowledged by yourself, and established\nby valid means of proof. Nor may you urge against this that all these alleged\nattributes are in reality mere 'consciousness' or 'knowing'; for they are\nessentially distinct. By 'being conscious' or 'knowing', we understand the\nillumining or manifesting of some object to its own substrate (i.e. the\nsubstrate of knowledge), by its own existence (i.e. the existence of\nknowledge) merely; by self-luminousness (or 'self-illuminatedness') we\nunderstand the shining forth or being manifest by its own existence merely to\nits own substrate; the terms 'shining forth', 'illumining', 'being manifest'\nin both these definitions meaning the capability of becoming an object of\nthought and speech which is common to all things, whether intelligent or non-\nintelligent. Eternity again means 'being present in all time'; oneness means\n'being defined by the number one'. Even if you say that these attributes are\nonly negative ones, i.e. equal to the absence of non-intelligence and so on,\nyou still cannot avoid the admission that they are attributes of\nconsciousness. If, on the other hand, being of a nature opposite to non-\nintelligence and so on, be not admitted as attributes of consciousness--\nwhether of a positive or a negative kind--in addition to its essential nature;\nit is an altogether unmeaning proceeding to deny to it such qualities, as non-\nintelligence and the like.\n\nWe moreover must admit the following alternative: consciousness is either\nproved (established) or not. If it is proved it follows that it possesses\nattributes; if it is not, it is something absolutely nugatory, like a sky-\nflower, and similar purely imaginary things.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[54:1](sbe48020.htm#fr_11) The _S_ a _n_ kara is not entitled to refer to a\ndistinction of real and unreal division, because according to his theory all\ndistinction is unreal.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Consciousness is the attribute of a permanent Conscious\nself](sbe48021.htm)\n\n"
