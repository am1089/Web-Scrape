Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# RAMAYANA BOOK IV\n\n# RAMA-BHARATA-SAMBADA\n\n_\n\n(The Meeting of the Princes)\n\n_\n\nTHE scene of this Book is laid at Chitra-kuta. Bharat returning from the\nkingdom of the Kaikeyas heard of his father\'s death and his brother\'s exile,\nand refused the throne which had been reserved for him. He wandered through\nthe woods and jungle to Chitra-kuta, and implored Rama to return to Ayodhya\nand seat himself on the throne of his father. But Rama had given his word, and\nwould not withdraw from it.\n\nFew passages in the Epic are more impressive than Rama\'s wise and kindly\nadvice to Bharat on the duties of a ruler, and his firm refusal to Bharat\'s\npassionate appeal to seat himself on the throne. Equally touching is the\nlament of Queen Kausalya when she meets Sita in the dress of an anchorite in\nthe forest.\n\nBut one of the most curious passages in the whole Epic is the speech of Jabali\nthe Sceptic, who denied heaven and a world here-after. In ancient India as in\nancient Greece there were different schools of philosophers, some of them\northodox and some of them extremely heterodox, and the greatest latitude of\nfree thought was permitted. In Jabali, the poet depicts a free-thinker of the\nbroadest type. He ridicules the ideas of Duty and of Future Life with a force\nof reasoning which a Greek sophist and philosopher could not have surpassed.\nBut Rama answers with the fervour of a righteous, truth-loving, God-fearing\nman.\n\nAll persuasion was in vain, and Bharat returned to Ayodhya with Rama\'s\nsandals, and placed them on the throne, as an emblem of Rama\'s sovereignty\nduring his voluntary exile. Rama himself then left Chitra-kuta and sought the\ndeeper forests of Dandak, so that his friends and relations might not find him\nagain during his exile. He visited the hermitage of the Saint Atri; and the\nancient and venerable wife of Atri welcomed the young Sita, and robed her in\nrich raiments and jewels, on the eve of her departure for the unexplored\nwildernesses of the south.\n\nThe portions translated in this Book are the whole or the main portions of\nSections xcix., c., ci., civ., cviii.. cix., exii., and cxix. of Book ii. of\nthe original text.\n\n## I\n\n## THE MEETING OF THE BROTHERS\n\nSorrowing for his sire departed Bharat to Ayodhya came,  \nBut the exile of his brother stung his noble heart to flame,\n\nScorning sin-polluted empire, travelling with each widowed queen,  \nSought through wood and trackless jungle Chitra-kuta\'s peaceful scene.\n\nRoyal guards and Saint Vasishtha loitered with the dames behind,  \nOnward pressed the eager Bharat, Rama\'s hermit-home to find,\n\nNestled in a jungle thicket, Rama\'s cottage rose in sight,  \nThatched with leaves and twining branches, reared by Lakshman\'s faithful\nmight.\n\nFaggots hewn of gnarled branches, blossoms culled from bush and tree.  \nCoats of bark and russet garments, kusa spread upon the lea,\n\nStore of horns and branching antlers, fire-wood for the dewy night,--  \nSpake the dwelling of a hermit suited for a hermit\'s rite.\n\n"May the scene," so Bharat uttered, "by the righteous _rishi_ told,  \nMarkalvati\'s rippling waters, Chitra-kuta\'s summit bold,\n\nMark the dark and trackless forest where the untamed tuskers roam,  \nAnd the deep and hollow caverns where the wild beasts make their home,\n\nMark the spacious wooded uplands, wreaths of smoke obscure the sky,  \nHermits feed their flaming altars for their worship pure and high.\n\nDone our weary work and wand\'ring, righteous Rama here we meet,  \nSaint and king and honoured elder! Bharat bows unto his feet,\n\nBorn a king of many nations, he hath forest refuge sought,  \nYielded throne and mighty kingdom for a hermit\'s humble cot,\n\nHonour unto righteous Rama, unto Sita true and bold,  \nTheirs be fair Kosala\'s empire, crown and sceptre, wealth and gold!\n\nStately _Sal_ and feathered palm-tree on the cottage lent their shade.  \nStrewn upon the sacred altar was the grass of _kusa_ spread,\n\nGaily on the walls suspended hung two bows of ample height,  \nAnd their back with gold was pencilled, bright as INDRA\'s bow of might,\n\nCased in broad unfailing quivers arrows shone like light of day,  \nAnd like flame-tongued fiery serpents cast a dread and lurid ray,\n\nResting in their golden scabbards lay the sword of warriors bold,  \nAnd the targets broad and ample bossed with rings of yellow gold,\n\nGlove and gauntlet decked the cottage safe from fear of hostile men,  \nAs from creatures of the forest is the lion\'s lordly den!\n\nCalm in silent contemplation by the altar\'s sacred fire,  \nHoly in his pious purpose though begirt by weapons dire,\n\nClad in deer-skin pure and peaceful, poring on the sacred flame,  \nIn his bark and hermit\'s tresses like an anchorite of fame,\n\nLion-shouldered, mighty-armed, but with gentle lotus eye.  \nLord of wide earth ocean-girdled, but intent on penance high,\n\nGodlike as the holy BRAHMA, on a skin of dappled deer  \nRama sat with meek-eyed Sita, faithful Lakshman loitered near!\n\n"Is this he whom joyous nations called to fair Ayodhya\'s throne,  \nNow the friend of forest-rangers wandering in the woods alone,\n\nIs this he who robed in purple made Ayodhya\'s mansions bright..  \nNow in jungle bark and deer-skin clad as holy anchorite,\n\nIs this be whose wreathed ringlets fresh and holy fragrance shed,  \nNow a hermit\'s matted tresses cluster round his royal head,\n\nIs this he whose royal _yajnas_ filled the earth with righteous fame,  \nNow inured to hermit\'s labour by the altar\'s sacred flame,\n\nIs this he whose brow and forehead royal gem and jewel graced,  \nHeir to proud Kosala\'s empire, eldest, noblest, and the best!"\n\nThus lamented pious Bharat, for his heart was anguish-rent,  \nAs before the feet of Rama he in loving homage bent,\n\n" _Arya!_ " in his choking accents this was all that Bharat said,  \n" _Arya!_ " spake the young Satrughna and he bent his holy head!\n\nRama to his loving bosom raised his brothers from his feet,  \nAh, too deep is love for utterance when divided brothers meet,\n\nFaithful Guha, brave Sumantra, bowed to Rama\'s righteous feet,  \nAnd a joy and mingled sadness filled the hermit\'s calm retreat!\n\n## II\n\n## BHARAT\'S ENTREATY AND RAMA\'S REPLY\n\n"Speak, my true, my faithful Bharat," so the righteous Rama cried,  \n"Wherefore to this jungle dwelling hast thou from Ayodhya hied,\n\nSpeak, my fond and loving brother, if our father bade thee come,  \nLeaving throne and spacious empire in this wilderness to roam?\n\nHeir and Regent of Kosala! Dost thou tend our father well,  \nAnd obey the lofty mandate from his royal lips that fell,\n\nAnd the ancient Dasa-ratha, glorious still in regal might,  \nDoth he pass his bright life\'s evening in each pure and holy rite?\n\nDoth my mother, Queen Kausalya, still for Rama wet her eye,  \nAnd the gentle Queen Sumitra for her banished Lakshman sigh,\n\nDoth the peerless Queen Kaikeyi pass her days in duties fair,  \nGuard her Bharat\'s mighty empire, tend him with a mother\'s care?\n\nIs each holy rite and homage to the Gods and Fathers done,  \nIs the honour due to elders rendered by each duteous son,\n\nDo thy warriors guard thy kingdom as of yore with matchless skill,  \nAnd with counsel deep and duteous do thy min\'sters serve thy will?\n\nRich thy fields in corn and produce fed by rivers broad and deep,  \nRich thy green unending pastures with the kine and fattened sheep,\n\nTend the herdsman and his cattle, tend the tiller of the soil,  \nWatch and help with all thy bounty workmen in their peaceful toil,\n\nFor the monarch\'s highest duty is to serve his people\'s weal  \nAnd the ruler\'s richest glory is to labour and to heal!\n\nGuard thy forts with sleepless caution with the engines of the war,  \nWith the men who shoot the arrow and who drive the flying car,\n\nGuard Kosala\'s royal treasure, make thy gifts of wealth and food,  \nNot to lords and proud retainers, but to worthy and the good!\n\nReader justice pure and spotless as befits thy royal line,  \nAnd to save the good and guiltless, Bharat, be it ever thine,\n\nFor the tears of suffering virtue wither like the thunder levin,  \nAnd they slay our men and cattle like the wrath of righteous heaven,\n\nFruitful be thy lore of Veda, fruitful be each pious rite,  \nBe thy queen a fruitful mother, be thy empire full of might!"\n\nWeeping, weeping, Bharat answered Dasa-ratha\'s eldest son,  \n"Dasa-ratha walks the bright sky, for his earthly task is done!\n\nFor impelled by Queen Kaikeyi to the woods he bade thee go,  \nAnd his spotless fame was clouded and his bosom sank in woe,\n\nAnd my mother, late repenting, weeps her deed of deepest shame,  \nWeeps her wedded lord departed, and a woman\'s tarnished fame!\n\nThou alone canst wipe this insult by a deed of kindness done,  \nRule o\'er Dasa-ratha\'s empire, Dasa-ratha\'s eldest son,\n\nWeeping queens and loyal subjects supplicate thy noble grace,  \nRule o\'er Raghu\'s ancient empire, son of Raghu\'s royal race!\n\nFor our ancient Law ordaineth and thy Duty makes it plain,  \nEldest-born succeeds his father as the king of earth and main,\n\nBy the fair Earth loved and welcomed, Rama, be her wedded lord,  \nAs by planet-jewelled Midnight is the radiant Moon adored!\n\nAnd thy father\'s ancient min\'sters and thy courtiers faithful still,  \nWait to do thy righteous mandate and to serve thy royal will,\n\nAs a pupil, as a brother, as a slave, I seek thy grace,  \nCome and rule thy father\'s empire, king of Raghu\'s royal race!"\n\nWeeping, on the feet of Rama, Bharat placed his lowly head,  \nWeeping for his sire departed, tears of sorrow Rama shed,\n\nThen he raised his loving brother with an elder\'s deathless love,  \nSorrow wakes our deepest kindness and our holiest feelings prove!\n\n"But I may not," answered Rama, "seek Ayodhya\'s ancient throne,  \nFor a righteous father\'s mandate duteous son may not disown,\n\nAnd I may not, gentle brother, break the word of promise given,  \nTo a king and to a father who is now a saint in heaven!\n\nNot on thee, nor on thy mother, rests the censure or the blame,  \nFaithful to his father\'s wishes Rama to the forest came,\n\nFor the son and duteous consort serve the father and the lord,  \nHigher than an empire\'s glory is a father\'s spoken word!\n\nAll inviolate is his mandate,--on Ayodhya\'s jewelled throne,  \nOr in pathless woods and jungle Rama shall his duty own,\n\nAll inviolate is the blessing by a loving mother given,  \nFor she blessed my life in exile like a pitying saint of heaven!\n\n_\n\nThou shalt rule the kingdom, Bharat, guard our loving people well,  \nClad in wild bark and in deer-skin I shall in the forests dwell,\n\nSo spake saintly Dasa-ratha in Ayodhya\'s palace hall,  \nAnd a righteous father\'s mandate duteous son may not recall!"\n\n_\n\n## III\n\n## KAUSALYA\'S LAMENT AND RAMA\'S REPLY\n\nSlow and sad with Saint Vasishtha, with each widowed royal dame,  \nUnto Rama\'s hermit-cottage ancient Queen Kausalya came,\n\nAnd she saw him clad in wild bark like a hermit stern and high,  \nAnd an anguish smote her bosom and a tear bedewed her eye.\n\nRama bowed unto his mother and each elder\'s blessings sought,  \nHeld their feet in salutation with a holy reverence fraught,\n\nAnd the queens with loving fingers, with a mother\'s tender care,  \nSwept the dust of wood and jungle from his head and bosom fair,\n\nLakshman too in loving homage bent before each royal dame,  \nAnd they blessed the faithful hero spotless in his righteous fame.\n\nLastly came the soft-eyed Sita with obeisance soft and sweet,  \nAnd with hands in meekness folded bent her tresses to their feet,\n\nPain and anguish smote their bosoms, round their Sita as they prest,  \nAs a mother clasps a daughter, clasped her in their loving breast!\n\nTorn from royal hall and mansions, ranger of the darksome wood,  \nReft of home and kith and kindred by her forest but she stood!\n\n"Hast thou, daughter of Videha," weeping thus Kausalya said,  \n"Dwelt in woods and leafy cottage and in pathless jungle strayed,\n\nHast thou, Rama\'s royal consort, lived a homeless anchorite  \nPale with rigid fast and penance, worn with toil of righteous rite?\n\nBut thy sweet face, gentle Sita, is like faded lotus dry,  \nAnd like lily parched by sunlight, lustreless thy beauteous eye,\n\nLike the gold untimely tarnished is thy sorrow-shaded brow,  \nLike the moon by shadows darkened is thy form of beauty now!\n\nAnd an anguish scathes my bosom like the withering forest fire,  \nThus to see thee, duteous daughter, in misfortunes deep and dire,\n\nDark is wide Kosala\'s empire, dark is Raghu\'s royal house,  \nWhen in woods my Rama wanders and my Rama\'s royal spouse!\n\n_\n\nSweetly, gentle Sita answered, answered Rama fair and tall,  \nThat a righteous father\'s mandate duteous son may not recall!\n\n_\n\n## IV\n\n## JABALI\'S REASONING AND RAMA\'S REPLY\n\nJabali a learned Brahman and a Sophist skilled in word,  \nQuestioned Faith and Law and Duty, spake to young Ayodhya\'s lord:\n\nWherefore, Rama, idle maxims cloud thy heart and warp thy mind,  \nMaxims which mislead the simple and the thoughtless human kind?\n\nLove nor friendship doth a mortal to his kith or kindred own,  \nEntering on his Nvide earth friendless, and departing all alone,\n\nFoolishly upon the father and the mother dotes the son,  \nKinship is an idle fancy,-save thyself thy kith is none!\n\nIn the wayside inn he halteth who in distant lands doth roam,  \nLeaves it with the dawning daylight for another transient home,\n\nThus on earth are kin and kindred, home and country, wealth and store,  \nWe but meet them on our journey, leave them as we pass before!\n\nWherefore for a father\'s mandate leave thy empire and thy throne,  \nPass thy days in trackless jungle sacrificing all thy own,\n\nWherefore to Ayodhya\'s city, as to longing wife\'s embrace,  \nSpeed\'st thou not to rule thy empire, lord of Raghu\'s royal race?\n\nDasa-ratha claims no duty, and this will is empty word,  \nView him as a foreign monarch, of thy realm thou art the lord,\n\nDasa-ratha is departed, gone where all the mortals go,  \nFor a dead man\'s idle mandate wherefore lead this life of woe?\n\nAh! I weep for erring mortals who on erring duty bent  \nSacrifice their dear enjoyment till their barren life is spent,\n\nWho to Gods and to the Fathers vainly still their offerings make,  \nWaste of food! for God nor Father doth our pious homage take!\n\nAnd the food by one partaken, can it nourish other men,  \nFood bestowed upon a Brahman, can it serve our Fathers then?\n\nCrafty priests have forged these maxims and with selfish objects say,  \nMake thy gifts and do thy penance, leave thy worldly wealth and pray!\n\nThere is no Hereafter, Rama, vain the hope and creed of men,  \nSeek the pleasures of the present, spurn illusions poor and vain,\n\nTake the course of sense and wisdom, cast all idle faith aside,  \nTake the kingdom Bharat offers, rule Ayodhya in thy pride!"\n\n"Fair thy purpose," answered Rama," false thy reason leads astray,  \nTortuous wisdom brings no profit, virtue shuns the crooked way,\n\nFor the deed proclaims the hero from the man of spacious lies,  \nMarks the true and upright Arya from the scheming worldly-wise!\n\nIf assuming virtue\'s mantle I should seek the sinful path,  \nGods who judge our secret motives curse me with their deepest wrath,\n\nAnd thy counsel helps not, _rishi_ , mansions of the sky to win,  \nAnd a king his subjects follow adding deeper sin to sin!\n\nSweep aside thy crafty reasoning, Truth is still our ancient way,  \nTruth sustains the earth and nations and a monarch\'s righteous sway,\n\nMighty Gods and holy sages find in Truth their haven shore,  \nScorning death and dark destruction, Truth survives for evermore!\n\nDeadlier than the serpent\'s venom is the venom of a lie,  \nFrom the false, than from the cobra, men with deeper terror fly,\n\nDearer than the food to mortals, Truth as nourishment is given,  \nTruth sustains the wide creation, Truth upholds the highest heaven,\n\nVain were gifts and sacrifices, rigid penances were vain,  \nProfitless the holy Vedas but for Truth which they sustain,\n\nGifts and rites and rigid penance have no aim or purpose high,  \nSave in Truth which rules the wide earth and the regions of the sky!\n\nI have plighted truth and promise and my word may not unsay,  \nFourteen years in pathless forests father\'s mandate I obey,\n\nAnd I seek no spacious reasons my relinquished throne to win,  \nGods nor Fathers nor the Vedas counsel tortuous paths of sin!\n\nPardon, _rishi_ , still unchanging shall remain my promise given  \nTo my mother Queen Kaikeyi, to my father now in heaven,\n\nPardon, _rishi_ , still in jungle we shall seek the forest fare,  \nWorship Gods who watch our actions, and pervade the earth and air!\n\nUnto AGNI, unto VAYU, shall my constant prayers run,  \nI shall live like happy INDRA, hundred sacrifices done,\n\n_\n\nAnd the deep and darksome jangle shall be Rama\'s royal hall,  \nFor a righteous father\'s mandate duteous son may not recall!"\n\n_\n\n## V\n\n## THE SANDALS\n\nTears nor sighs nor sad entreaty Rama\'s changeless purpose shook,  \nTill. once more with hands conjoined Bharat to his elder spoke:\n\n"Rama, true to royal mercy, true to duties of thy race,  \nGrant this favour to thy mother, to thy brother grant this grace,\n\nVain were my unaided efforts to protect our father\'s throne,  \nTown and hamlet, lord and tiller, turn to thee and thee alone!\n\nUnto Rama, friends and kinsmen, chiefs and warriors, turn in pain,  \nAnd each city chief and elder, and each humble village swain,\n\nBase thy empire strong, unshaken, on a loyal nation\'s will,  \nWith thy worth and with thy valour serve thy faithful people still!"\n\nRama raised the prostrate Bharat to his ever-loving breast,  \nAnd in voice of tuneful _hansa_ thus his gentle speech addrest:\n\n"Trust me, Bharat, lofty virtue, strength and will to thee belong,  \nThou could\'st rule a worldwide empire in thy faith and purpose strong,\n\nAnd our father\'s ancient min\'sters, ever faithful, wise and deep,  \nThey shall help thee with their counsel and thy ancient frontiers keep.\n\nList! the Moon may lose his lustre, Himalaya lose his snow,  \nHeaving Ocean pass his confines surging from the caves below,\n\nBut the truth-abiding Rama will not move from promise given,  \nHe hath spoke and will not palter, help him righteous Gods in heaven!"\n\nBlazing like the Sun in splendour, beauteous like the Lord of Night,  \nRama vowed his Vow of Duty, changeless in his holy might!\n\n"Humble token," answered Bharat, "still I seek from Rama\'s hand,  \nToken of his love and kindness, token of his high command,\n\nFrom thy feet cast forth those sandals, they shall decorate the throne.  \nThey shall nerve my heart to duty and shall safely guard thy own,\n\nThey shall to a loyal nation absent monarch\'s will proclaim,  \nWatch the frontiers of the empire and the people\'s homage claim!"\n\nRama gave the loosened sandals as his younger humbly prayed,  \nBharat bowed to them in homage and his parting purpose said:\n\n"Not alone will banished Rama barks and matted tresses wear,  \nFourteen years the crowned Bharat will in hermit\'s dress appear,\n\nHenceforth Bharat dwells in palace guised as hermit of the wood,  \nIn the sumptuous hall of feasting wild fruit is his only food,\n\nFourteen years shall pass in waiting, weary toil and penance dire  \nThen, if Rama comes not living, Bharat dies upon the pyre!"\n\n## VI\n\n## THE HERMITAGE OF ATRI\n\nWith the sandals of his elder Bharat to Ayodhya went,  \nRama sought for deeper forests on his arduous duty bent,\n\nWandering with his wife and Lakshman slowly sought the hermitage,  \nWhere resided saintly Atri, Vedic Bard and ancient sage.\n\nAuasuya, wife of Atri, votaress of Gods above,  \nWelcomed Sita in her cottage, tended her with mother\'s love,\n\nGave her robe and holy garland, jewelled ring and chain of gold,  \nHeard the tale of love and sadness which the soft-eyed Sita told:\n\nHow the monarch of Videha held the plough and tilled the earth,  \nFrom the furrow made by ploughshare infant Sita sprang to birth,\n\nHow the monarch of Videha welcomed kings of worth and pride,  \nRama \'midst the gathered monarchs broke the bow and won the bride,\n\nHow by Queen Kaikeyi\'s mandate Rama lost his father\'s throne,  \nSita followed him in exile in the forest dark and lone!\n\nSoftly from the lips of Sita words of joy and sorrow fell,  \nAnd the pure-souled pious priestess wept to hear the tender tale,\n\nAnd she kissed her on the forehead, held her on her ancient breast,  \nAnd in mother\'s tender accents thus her gentle thoughts exprest:\n\n"Sweet the tale you tell me, Sita, of thy wedding and thy love,  \nOf the true and tender Rama, righteous as the Gods above,\n\nAnd thy wifely deep devotion fills my heart with purpose high,  \nStay with us my gentle daughter for the night shades gather nigh.\n\nHastening from each distant region feathered songsters seek their nest,  \nTwitter in the leafy thickets ere they seek their nightly rest,\n\nHastening from their pure ablutions with their pitcher smooth and fair,  \nIn their dripping barks the hermits to their evening rites repair,\n\nAnd in sacred _agni-hotra_ holy anchorites engage,  \nAnd a wreath of smoke ascending marks the altar of each sage.\n\nNow a deeper shadow mantles bush and brake and trees around,  \nAnd a thick and inky darkness falls upon the distant ground,\n\nMidnight prowlers of the jungle steal beneath the sable shade,  \nBut the tame deer by the altar seeks his wonted nightly bed.\n\nMark! how by the stars encircled sails the radiant Lord of Night,  \nWith his train of silver glory streaming o\'er the azure height,\n\nAnd thy consort waits thee, Sita, but before thou leavest, fair,  \nLet me deck thy brow and bosom with these jewels rich and rare,\n\nOld these eyes and grey these tresses, but a thrill of joy is mine,  \nThus to see thy youth and beauty in this gorgeous garment shine!"\n\nPleased at heart the ancient priestess clad her in apparel meet,  \nAnd the young wife glad and grateful bowed to Anasuya\'s feet,\n\nRobed and jewelled, bright and beauteous, sweet-eyed Sita softly came,  \nWhere with anxious heart awaited Rama prince of righteous fame.\n\nWith a wifely love and longina Sita met her hero bold,  \nAnasuya\'s love and kindness in her grateful accents told,\n\nRama and his brother listened of the grace by Sita gained,  \nFavours of the ancient priestess, pious blessings she had rained.\n\nIn the _rishi\'s_ peaceful _asram_ Rama passed the sacred night,  \nIn the hushed and silent forest silvered by the moon\'s pale light,\n\nDaylight dawned, to deeper forests Rama went serene and proud,  \nAs the sun in midday splendour sinks within a bank of cloud!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book V: On the Banks of the Godavari](rama05.htm)\n\n'
