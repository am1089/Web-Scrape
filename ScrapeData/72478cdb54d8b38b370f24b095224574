He should initiate a Brahma _n_ a, when he is eight years old, or in the\neighth year after the conception,\n\n2\\. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana, when he is eleven years old,\n\np. 304\n\n3\\. A Vai _s_ ya, when he is twelve years old.\n\n4\\. Or according as it is considered auspicious by all (the different\nfamilies).\n\n5\\. He should feed the Brahma _n_ as. And they lead him (i.e. the boy who is\nto be initiated) on, with his head shaven all round, and decked with\nornaments.\n\n6 6. (The teacher) makes him place himself to the west of the fire and say, 'I\nhave come hither for the sake of studentship (brahma _k_ arya).' And, 'I will\nbe a student (brahma _k_ arin).'\n\n7\\. He then makes him put on a garment with (the verse), 'In the way in which\nB _ri_ haspati put the garment of immortality on Indra, thus I put (this\ngarment) on thee, for the sake of long life, of old age, of strength, of\nsplendour.'\n\n8 8. He ties round him the girdle with (the verse which the youth recites),\n'Here has come to me, keeping away evil words, purifying my kind as a\n[purifier](errata.htm#1), clothing herself, by (the power of) inhalation and\nexhalation, with strength, this sisterly goddess, this blessed girdle.'\n\n9 9. Or, 'A youth, well attired, dressed, came hither. He, being born, becomes\nglorious. Wise sages extol him, devout ones, turning their minds to the gods.'\n\n10\\. Or silently.\n\n11\\. He gives him the staff.\n\np. 305\n\n12\\. (The student) accepts it with (the verse), 'My staff which fell down to\nthe ground in the open air, that I take up again for the sake of long life, of\nholiness, of holy lustre.'\n\n13 13. According to some (teachers he accepts the staff) in the way prescribed\nfor the inauguration, because it is said, 'He enters upon a long Sattra (or\nsacrificial period).'\n\n14\\. (The teacher) then with his joined hands fills (the student's) joined\nhands with water with the three (verses), 'Ye waters are' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h.\nXI, 50 seqq.).\n\n15 15. He then makes him look at the sun with (the verse), 'That eye' (Va _g_.\nSa _m_ h. XXXVI, 24).\n\n16 16. He then touches his heart, (reaching) over his right shoulder, with\n(the words), 'Into my will I take thy heart, &c.'\n\n17 17. He then seizes (the student's) right hand and says, 'What is thy name?\n\n18\\. He replies, 'I am N.N., sir!'\n\n19\\. He then says to him, 'Whose pupil (brahma _k_ arin) art thou?'\n\n20 20. After (the student) has said, 'Yours!'\xc2\x97(the\n\np. 306\n\nteacher replies,) 'Indra's pupil art thou; Agni is thy teacher; I am thy\nteacher, N.N.!'\n\n21\\. He then gives him in charge to living beings with (the formulas), 'To Pra\n_g_ apati I give thee in charge. To the god Savit _ri_ I give thee in charge.\nTo the waters, the herbs I give thee in charge. To Heaven and Earth I give\nthee in charge. To the Vi _s_ ve devas I give thee in charge. To all beings I\ngive thee in charge for the sake of freedom from harm.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[304:6](sbe29175.htm#fr_765) 6 seqq. Comp. _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a XI, 5, 4.\n\n[304:8](sbe29175.htm#fr_766) The commentators differ as to whether the \xc3\x82 _k_\narya or the youth should recite the verse. The comparison of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana II,\n2, 1 would rather tend to show that it is the teacher, but Gobhila II, 10 says\nexpressly: athaina _m_ tri _h_ pradakshi _n_ a _m_ mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ amekhala _m_\npariharan va _k_ ayatiya _m_ duruktat paribadhamanety _ri_ tasya goptriti va.\n\n[304:9](sbe29175.htm#fr_767) Rig-veda III, 8, 4. The verse is originally\naddressed to Agni.\n\n[305:13](sbe29175.htm#fr_768) _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a XI, 3, 3, 2: 'He\nenters upon a long Sattra, who enters upon Brahma _k_ arya.' The student, when\nbeing initiated, ought to behave, consequently, in the same way as those who\nreceive the inauguration (diksha) for a long Sattra. This is the meaning of\nthis Sutra. The rules regarding the staff handed over by the Adhvaryu to the\nYa _g_ amana at the diksha ceremony are given by Katyayana, _S_ rauta-sutra\nVII, 4, 1-4.\n\n[305:15](sbe29175.htm#fr_769) See above, I, 8, 7.\n\n[305:16](sbe29175.htm#fr_770) See above, I, 8, 8.\n\n[305:17](sbe29175.htm#fr_771) 17 seqq. Comp. _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a XI, 5,\n4, 1 seqq.\n\n[305:20](sbe29175.htm#fr_772) The words 'I am thy teacher' are omitted in one\nof Professor Stenzler's MSS. and in his translation. But they are given in the\nparallel passage of the _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a. The p. 306 parallel passage\nin _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana (G _ri_ hya II, 3, 1) also runs thus: Agnir a _k_ aryas tava,\nasav, aha _m_ _k_ obhau.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3](sbe29176.htm)\n\n"
