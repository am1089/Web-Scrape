Not on account of place even (is there any imperfection) of the Highest;\nfor everywhere (it is described) as having twofold characteristics.\n\nThe different states of the individual soul have been discussed, to the end\nthat an insight into their imperfections may give rise to indifference towards\nall worldly enjoyments. Next now, in order to give rise to the desire of\nattaining to Brahman, the Sutras proceed to expound how Brahman's nature is\nraised above all imperfections and constituted by mere blessed qualities. The\nfollowing point requires to be considered first. Do those imperfections which\ncling to the individual soul in consequence of its different states--viz. the\nwaking state, dreams, deep sleep, swoon, departure from the body--affect also\nthe highest Brahman which as its inner Ruler abides within the soul in those\ndifferent states, or not?--They do affect it, since Brahman abides within the\nbodies which are in those different states.--But Sutras such as I, 2, 8 have\nalready declared that the highest Brahman, because not subject to the\ninfluence of karman, is free from all imperfections; how then can\nimperfections cling to it for the reason that it is connected with this or\nthat place?--In the following way. As was shown under III, 2, 6, works give\nrise to imperfection and suffering in so far as they cause the connexion of\nthe soul with a body. The efficient cause therein is the imperfection inherent\nin the connexion with a body; for otherwise the works themselves would\ndirectly give rise to pain, and what then would be the use of the connexion\nwith a body? Hence, even in the case of a being not subject to karman, its\nconnexion with various unholy bodies will cause imperfection and suffering.\nAnd even when such a being voluntarily enters into such bodies in order to\nrule\n\np. 608\n\nthem, connexion with imperfections is unavoidable; no less than to be immersed\nin blood and purulent matter, even if done voluntarily, will make a man\nunclean. Although therefore Brahman is the sole cause of the world and a\ntreasure-house of all blessed qualities, yet it is affected by the\nimperfections springing therefrom that, as declared by Scripture, it abides\nwithin matter, bodies, and their parts, and thus is connected with them (cp.\n'he who abides within earth, within the soul, within the eye, within the\nseed,' &c., B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 3).\n\nOf this prima facie view the Sutra disposes by saying--'Not even from place,\nsuch as earth, soul, &c., is there possible for the highest Self a shadow even\nof imperfection; since everywhere in Scripture as well as Sm _ri_ ti Brahman\nis described as having characteristics of a double kind; viz. on the one hand\nfreedom from all imperfections, and on the other possession of all blessed\nqualities. For Scripture says that the Supreme Person is free from evil, free\nfrom old age, free from death, free from grief, free from hunger and thirst;\nthat all his wishes realise themselves, that all its purposes realise\nthemselves' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 5)--And Sm _ri_ ti says, 'He comprises within\nhimself all blessed qualities, by a particle of his power the whole mass of\nbeings is supported. In him there are combined energy, strength, might,\nwisdom, valour, and all other noble qualities. He is the Highest of the high,\nno pain or other imperfections affect him, the Lord of all, high or low. From\nall evil he is free, he whose name is Vish _n_ u, the highest abode.' These\nand other passages teach that Brahman possesses the double characteristics\nstated above.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 12. Should it be said 'on account of difference'...](sbe48356.htm)\n\n"
