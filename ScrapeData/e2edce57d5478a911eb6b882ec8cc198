The waste of _Joradighi_ lies wan and\ngrey before us. The land is desolate and barren.\n\nYou are frightened and thinking--"I know not where we have come to."\n\nI say to you, "Mother, do not be afraid."\n\nThe meadow is prickly with spiky grass, and through it runs a narrow broken\npath.\n\nThere are no cattle to be seen in the wide field; they have gone to their\nvillage stalls.\n\nIt grows dark and dim on the land and sky, and we cannot tell where we are\ngoing.\n\nSuddenly you call me and ask me in a whisper, "What light is that near the\nbank?"\n\nJust then there bursts out a fearful yell, and figures come running towards\nus.\n\nYou sit crouched in your palanquin and repeat the names of the gods in prayer.\n\nThe bearers, shaking in terror, hide themselves in the thorny bush.\n\nI shout to you, "Don\'t be afraid, mother. I am here."\n\nWith long sticks in their hands and hair all wild about their heads, they come\nnearer and nearer.\n\nI shout, "Have a care! you villains! One step more and you are dead men."\n\nThey give another terrible yell and rush forward.\n\nYou clutch my hand and say, "Dear boy, for heaven\'s sake, keep away from\nthem."\n\nI say, "Mother, just you watch me."\n\nThen I spur my horse for a wild gallop, and my sword and buckler clash against\neach other.\n\nThe fight becomes so fearful, mother, that it would give you a cold shudder\ncould you see it from your palanquin.\n\nMany of them fly, and a great number are cut to pieces.\n\nI know you are thinking, sitting all by yourself, that your boy must be dead\nby this time.\n\nBut I come to you all stained with blood, and say, "Mother, the fight is over\nnow."\n\nYou come out and kiss me, pressing me to your heart, and you say to yourself,\n\n"I don\'t know what I should do if I hadn\'t my boy to escort me."\n\nA thousand useless things happen day after day, and why couldn\'t such a thing\ncome true by chance?\n\nIt would be like a story in a book.\n\nMy brother would say, "Is it possible? I always thought he was so delicate!"\n\nOur village people would all say in amazement, "Was it not lucky that the boy\nwas with his mother?"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The End](cm34.htm)\n\n'
