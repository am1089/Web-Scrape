'A reason' for hurting a cow is, according\nto Haradatta, anger, or the desire to obtain meat.\n\n[84:2](sbe0229.htm#fr_478) Manu XI, 141; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 269. That 'animals\nwithout bones,' i.e. insects or mollusks, are intended in the Sutra is an\ninference, drawn by Haradatta from the parallel passages of Gautama, Manu, and\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya.\n\n[84:3](sbe0229.htm#fr_479) 'A person who ought not to be abused, i. e. a\nfather, a teacher, and the like.'--Haradatta.\n\n[84:5](sbe0229.htm#fr_480) The same penances, i. e. those prescribed I, 9,\n24-I, 9, 26, 4. According to Haradatta this Sutra is intended to teach that\nwomen shall not perform the penances which follow. Others, however, are of\nopinion that it is given in order to indicate that the preceding Sutras apply\nto women by an atide _s_ a, and that, according to a Smarta principle,\napplicable to such cases, it may be inferred, that women are to perform one-\nhalf only of the penances prescribed for men.\n\n[85:7](sbe0229.htm#fr_481) The Anuvaka intended is Taitt. Sa _m_ h. II, 5, 12.\n\n[85:8](sbe0229.htm#fr_482) Taitt. \xc3\x82r. II, 18, and Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 102;\nManu XI, 199 seq.; and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III, 280. Regarding the Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\na-rites, see \xc3\x82 _s_ v. G _ri_. Su. I, 1, 2, and Max Muller's History of Ancient\nSanskrit Literature, p. 203.\n\n[85:12](sbe0229.htm#fr_483) Regarding the Pataniya-crimes which cause loss of\ncaste, see above, I, 7, 21, 7 seq.\n\n[86:13](sbe0229.htm#fr_484) Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 102. According to the\ngreatness of the crime the number of the burnt-oblations must be increased and\nthe prayers be repeated.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 9, Kha _n_ _d_ a 27](sbe0230.htm)\n\n"
