And on account of the two conditions of standing and eating (of which the\nformer is characteristic of the highest Lord, the latter of the individual\nsoul).\n\nWith reference to that which is the abode of heaven, earth, and so on, the\ntext says, 'Two birds, inseparable friends,' &c. (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1). This\npassage describes the two states of mere standing, i.e. mere presence, and of\neating, the clause, 'One of them eats the sweet fruit,' referring to the\neating, i.e. the fruition of the results of works,\n\np. 160\n\nand the clause, 'The other one looks on without eating,' describing the\ncondition of mere inactive presence. The two states described, viz. of mere\npresence on the one hand and of enjoyment on the other hand, show that the\nLord and the individual soul are referred to. Now there is room for this\nstatement which represents the Lord as separate from the individual soul, only\nif the passage about the abode of heaven and earth likewise refers to the\nLord; for in that case only there exists a continuity of topic. On any other\nsupposition the second passage would contain a statement about something not\nconnected with the general topic, and would therefore be entirely uncalled\nfor.--But, it may be objected, on your interpretation also the second passage\nmakes an uncalled-for statement, viz. in so far as it represents the\nindividual soul as separate from the Lord.--Not so, we reply. It is nowhere\nthe purpose of Scripture to make statements regarding the individual soul.\nFrom ordinary experience the individual soul, which in the different\nindividual bodies is joined to the internal organs and other limiting\nadjuncts, is known to every one as agent and enjoyer, and we therefore must\nnot assume that it is that which Scripture aims at setting forth. The Lord, on\nthe other hand, about whom ordinary experience tells us nothing, is to be\nconsidered as the special topic of all scriptural passages, and we therefore\ncannot assume that any passage should refer to him merely casually 1.--\n\np. 161\n\n[paragraph continues] That the mantra 'two birds,' &c. speaks of the Lord--and\nthe individual soul we have already shown under I, 2, 11.--And if, according\nto the interpretation given in the Pai _n_ gi-upanishad (and quoted under I,\n2, 11), the verse is understood to refer to the internal organ (sattva) and\nthe individual soul (not to the individual soul and the Lord), even then there\nis no contradiction (between that interpretation and our present averment that\nthe individual soul is not the abode of heaven and earth).--How so?--Here\n(i.e. in the present Sutra and the Sutras immediately preceding) it is denied\nthat the individual soul which, owing to its imagined connexion with the\ninternal organ and other limiting adjuncts, has a separate existence in\nseparate bodies--its division being analogous to the division of universal\nspace into limited spaces such as the spaces within jars and the like--is that\nwhich is called the abode of heaven and earth. That same soul, on the other\nhand, which exists in all bodies, if considered apart from the limiting\nadjuncts, is nothing else but the highest Self. Just as the spaces within\njars, if considered apart from their limiting conditions, are merged in\nuniversal space, so the individual soul also is incontestably that which is\ndenoted as the abode of heaven and earth, since it (the soul) cannot really be\nseparate from the highest Self. That it is not the abode of heaven and earth,\nis therefore said of the individual soul in so far only as it imagines itself\nto be connected with the internal organ and so on. Hence it follows that the\nhighest Self is the abode of heaven, earth, and so on.--The same conclusion\nhas already been arrived at under I, 2, 21; for in the passage concerning the\nsource of all beings (which passage is discussed under the Sutra quoted) we\nmeet with the clause, 'In which heaven and\n\np. 162\n\nearth and the sky are woven.' In the present adhikara _n_ a the subject is\nresumed for the sake of further elucidation.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[160:1](sbe34076.htm#fr_174) If the individual soul were meant by the abode of\nheaven, earth, &c., the statement regarding \xc3\x8e _s_ vara made in the passage\nabout the two birds would be altogether abrupt, and on that ground\nobjectionable. The same difficulty does not present itself with regard to the\nabrupt mention of the individual soul which is well known to everybody, and to\nwhich therefore casual allusions may be made.--I subjoin \xc3\x82nanda Giri's\ncommentary on the entire passage: _G_ ivasyopadhyaikyenavivakshitatvat tad _g\n\xc3\xb1_ane#pi sarva _g \xc3\xb1_anasiddhes tasyayatanatvadyabhave hetvantara _m_ va _k_\nyam ity a _s_ a _n_ kya sutre _n_ a pariharati kuta _sk_ etyadina.
