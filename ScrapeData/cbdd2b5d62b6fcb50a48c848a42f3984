Then Kes'ini  \nThe mother of one heir would be.  \nSumati, sister of the king  [1](ry040.htm#fn_181)  \nOf all the birds that ply the wing,  \nTo that illustrious Brahman sued  \nThat she might bear the multitude  \nWhose fame throughout the world should sound  \nFor mighty enterprise renowned.  \nAround the saint the monarch went,  \nBowing his head, most reverent.  \nThen with his wives, with willing feet,  \nBesought his own imperial seat.  \nTime passed. The elder consort bare  \nA son called Asamanj, the heir.  \nThen Sumati, the younger, gave  \nBirth to a gourd,  [2](ry040.htm#fn_182) O hero brave,  \nWhose rind, when burst and cleft in two,  \nGave sixty thousand babes to view.  \nAll these with care the nurses laid  \nIn jars of oil; and there they stayed,  \nTill, youthful age and strength complete,  \nForth speeding from each dark retreat,  \nAll peers in valour, years, and might,  \nThe sixty thousand came to light.  \nPrince Asamanj, brought up with care,  \nScourge of his foes, was made the heir.  \nBut liegemen's boys he used to cast  \nTo Sarju's waves that hurried past,  \nLaughing the while in cruel glee  \nTheir dying agonies to see.  \nThis wicked prince who aye withstood  \nThe counsel of the wise and good,  \nWho plagued the people in his hate,  \nHis father banished from the state.  \nHis son, kind-spoken, brave, and tall,  \nWas Ans'uman, beloved of all.  \n   Long years flew by. The king decreed  \nTo slay a sacrificial steed.  \nConsulting with his priestly band  \nHe vowed the rite his soul had planned,  \nAnd, Veda skilled, by their advice  \nMade ready for the sacrifice.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[49:1b](ry039.htm#fr_180) I am compelled to omit Cantos XXXVII and XXXVIII,\nTHE GLORY OF UM\xc3\x80, and THE BIRTH OF K\xc3\x81RTIKEYA, as both in subject and language\noffensive to modern taste.
