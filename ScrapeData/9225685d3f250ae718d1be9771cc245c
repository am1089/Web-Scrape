Vyasa said :-- O King! When the tormented Devas praised thus, the Devi\ncreated from Her body another supremely beautiful form. This created form, the\nAmbika Devi, became known in all the worlds as Kaus\xc2\x92iki, as She came out of\nthe physical sheath of the Devi Parvati. When Kaus\xc2\x92iki was created out of the\nbody of Parvati, the Parvati\xc2\x92s body became transformed and turned out into a\nblack colour and became known as KaIika. Her terrible black appearance, when\nbeheld, increases the terror even of the Daityas. O King! This Devi is now\nbecome known in this world as Kalaratri, the night of destruction, at the end\nof the world, identified with Durga, the Fulfiller of all the desires. The\nAmbika Devi, then, began to look splendid, decked with various ornaments; Her\nbeautiful form began to look very lovely. The Devi Ambika then smiled a little\nand said, \xc2\x93Better be fearless; I will slay just now your enemies. It is My\nincumbent duty to carry out your purposes; I will therefore slay in battle\nNis\xc2\x92umbha and others for the sake of your happiness.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n8-30. Thus saying, the Devi Bhagavati, elated with pride, mounted on lion and,\ntaking Kalika with Her, entered into the city of S\xc2\x92umbha, the enemy of the\ngods. Ambika went to a garden adjoining the city accompanied by Kalika, and\nbegan to sing in such a sweet melodious tune that enchants even the God of\nLove, who fascinates the whole world. What more can be said than the fact\nthat, hearing that sweet melodious song, the birds and beasts became\nenchanted; the Devas then began to feel much pleasure from the Sky. In the\nmeanwhile Cha _nd_ a, Mu _nd_ a the two dreadful Asuras, and attendants of\nS\xc2\x92umbha, came out accidentally there on their sportive excursions and saw the\nbeautiful Ambika Devi singing and Kalika Devi sitting before Her. O best of\nKings! No sooner Cha _nd_ a, Mu _nd_ a saw the extraordinary beauty of the\nGoddess Bhagavati, than they went at once to S\xc2\x92umbha. On approaching towards\nthe lord of the Daityas sitting in his room, they bowed down and told thus in\na sweet voice :-- "O King! Here has come from the\n\n\n\np. 434\n\n\n\nHimalayas a woman accidentally, mounted on a lion; Her limbs are shining with\nall good signs so much so that even the God of love would be enchanted by Her\nsight. Nowhere, in the Devalokas, the Gandarbha Lokas or in this earth can be\nfound such a beautiful lady; we never saw nor heard about such a lady before.\nO King! That lady is singing so beautifully and pleasingly to all that even\nthe deer are standing motionless by Her side enchanted, as it were, by Her\nmelodious voice. O King! That Lady is fit for you; therefore determine first\nwhose daughter is this lady, what for she has come there and then marry Her.\nKnow this as certain that such a beautiful lady is not to be found anywhere in\nthis world. Therefore do you bring Her to your house and marry Her. O Lord of\nmen! You have acquired all the gems and jewels of the Devas; why not, then,\naccept this Gem in the form of a lady? O King! You have taken by force the\nexquisitely beautiful Airavata elephant of Indra, the Parijata Tree, the seven\nfaced horse Uchchais\xc2\x92rava, and many other jewels. You have acquired by your\nmight the Prince of Jewels, the celestial car of the Creator Brahma, ensigned\nby the emblematic Swan. You have dispossessed Kuvera of his treasure of the\nvalue of a Padma (one thousand billion) and Varu _n_ a, the God of oceans, of\nhis white umbrella. O King! When Varu _n_ a was defeated, your brother\nNis\xc2\x92umbha took perforce his Pas\xc2\x92a weapon. O King! The Great Ocean gave you,\nout of terror, various jewels and honoured you by presenting a garland of\nlotuses which never fade away. What more can be said than the fact that you\nhave conquered the Death and took away His force and that you have easily\nconquered Yama, the God of Death and have taken from Him His horrible staff. O\nKing! You have brought that Heavenly cow which came out when the ocean was\nchurned; that cow is still with you; what more to say than that Menaka and\nother Apsaras are under your control. Thus you have got by your strength all\nthe jewels. Why, then, are you not taking this exquisitely beautiful lady, the\nPrince of Jewels, amongst women. O King! All the jewels in your house, will\nserve their real purpose, no doubt, then and then only when they will shine\nwith this queen of jewels, this Lady. O Lord of the Daityas! There cannot be\nseen in all the Trilokas such a Beautiful Lady as this that I have now\ndescribed before you. Therefore bring this Beautiful Lady quickly and accept\nHer as your wife.\n\n\n\n31-35. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the sweet words of Cha _nd_ a and\nMu _nd_ a, S\xc2\x92umbha spoke gladly to Sugriva who was close by :-- \xc2\x93Go, Sugriva,\ndo my messenger\xc2\x92s work; you are well skilled in these things. Speak so that\nthe Beautiful Lady of thin waist may come over to me. Those who are well\nversed in the science of amorous love declare\n\n\n\np. 435\n\n\n\nthat only two methods are to be adopted by the clever persons towards the\nfemale sex :-- (1) conciliation and gentle words and (2) gifts and presents.\nFor if the policy of division or sowing dissensions be applied, then hypocrisy\nis shewn and that means the improper manifestation of love sentiment; whereas\nif chastisement be applied then the love sentiment becomes interrupted.\nTherefore, the wise have condemned these as corrupt means. O Messenger! Where\nis that woman who does not come round excited with passion when good and sweet\nwords are spoken to her in accordance with the S\xc2\x92ama and Dana methods?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n36-37. Vyasa said :-- Sugriva, hearing the nice skilled words of S\xc2\x92umbha went\nhurriedly to the spot where existed the Mother of the Universe. He saw the\nFair Lady mounted on a lion, saluted Her and spoke gently and sweetly as\nfollows :--\n\n\n\n38-49. The messenger said :-- \xc2\x93O Beautiful One! S\xc2\x92umbha, the enemy of the Gods\nand the King of all, is beautiful in all respects, the ruler of the three\nLokas, a great hero and conqueror of all. Hearing your beauty and loveliness,\nthat high-souled monarch is so much attached to you and has become so very\npassionate that he has sent me to you to express his views. O One of delicate\nlimbs! Please hear what that Lord of the Daityas has spoken to Thee, after\nduly saluting Thee, words full of love and affection towards Thee :-- O\nBeloved! I have defeated all the Devas and have thus become the Lord of the\nthree worlds; specially I partake of all the offerings made in sacrificial\nacts and ceremonies, without moving away from my house. I have taken away all\nthe gems, jewels and wealth that belonged to the Devas; consequently the abode\nof the Gods has become now worthless, on account of all its jewels being\ncarried sway. O Fair One! I am now enjoying all the jewels that exist in the\nTrilokas; so much so that all the Devas, Asuras, and human beings are passing\naway their times, subservient to Me. But no sooner Thy qualifications reached\nmy ears Thou hast penetrated into my heart and has made me completely\nsubservient to Thee; O Fair One! What am I to do now? Whatever Thou\ncommandest, I am ready to do that; verily I am now Thy servant; so Thou\noughtest to save me from the darts of passion. O One having swan-like eyes! I\nam verily made your captive. Specially I am extremely agitated by the arrows\nof Cupid; therefore dost Thou serve me when Thou wilt be made the Lord of the\nthree worlds and thus enjoy the incomparably excellent things. O Beloved! I\nwill remain ever Thy obedient servant up to the last moment of death. O\nExcellent One! I cannot ever be killed by the Devas, Asuras and human beings.\nO Fair faced One! Thou wilt be always prosperous and fortunate. Thou\n\n\n\np. 436\n\n\n\nwilt be able to sport anywhere Thou likest. O Devi! Please ponder over the\nabove words of the Lord of the Daityas in Thy heart and speak out Thy views\ngladly and with the same sweetness in reply; O Brisk One! I will go\nimmediately to S\xc2\x92umbha and inform him about Thy mind.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n50\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Devi, ready to serve the cause of the Gods,\nheard the messenger\xc2\x92s gentle words and replied smiling and sweetly.\n\n\n\n51-66. S\xc2\x92ri Devi spoke :-- I know fully well S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha; the King\nS\xc2\x92umbha is very powerful, the conqueror of all the Devas, and the destroyer of\nenemies. He is the repository of all good qualities, the enjoyer of all\npleasures, very valorous, charitable and is beautiful, in fact a second Cupid.\nHe is adorned with thirty-two auspicious signs; particularly he is a hero and\ncannot be killed by the Devas or human beings. O Messenger! Knowing this I\nhave come here to have a look of that great warrior S\xc2\x92umbha. The jewel comes\nin contact with gold to increase its lustre; so I have come here from afar to\nsee my husband. On seeing all the Devas, Gandharbhas, Rak _s_ asas and the\neminent beautiful persons on the earth I have come to know that they are all\nterror stricken and almost unconscious and shudder at the name of S\xc2\x92umbha. So,\non hearing about his abilities, I have now come here to see him. O Messenger!\nO Fortunate One! Better now go back to the great hero S\xc2\x92umbha and speak to him\nin private the following sweet words of Mine :-- \xc2\x93That you are foremost\namongst the powerful; beautiful of the beautifuls, skilled in all the branches\nof learning, well qualified, charitable, clever, born of a high noble family,\nenergetic, and conqueror of the Devas; especially, by the sheer force of your\narms, you are so much exalted and you now enjoy all the gems and jewels.\nTherefore, O King! Knowing your qualifications, I have come truly of my own\naccord to your city with the desire of getting for Me a husband. O High-souled\nOne! I am fit for your consort. O Lord of the Daityas! There is a slight hitch\nin My marriage. It is this: In my early days while I was playing with My\ncomrades, I promised before them privately partly out of childishness and\npartly out of vanity for bodily strength that I will certainly marry that hero\nwho is powerful like Me and who will defeat Me in battle, thus testing his\npowers and weaknesses. My comrades laughed at my words and spoke with wonder,\n\xc2\x91Why has this girl made such an extraordinarily difficult promise?\xc2\x92 Therefore,\nO Monarch! Better marry Me and fulfil My desires after knowing My strength and\ndefeating Me in a battle. O Beautiful One in all respects! Better come\nyourself or your younger Nis\xc2\x92umbha and perform the marriage ceremony after\ndefeating Me in the battlefield.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 437\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-third Chapter in the Fifth Book on the prowess of\nKaus\xc2\x92iki in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Mahapura _n_ am of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 24](bk05ch24.htm)\n\n'
