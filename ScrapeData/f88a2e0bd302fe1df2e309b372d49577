If it is night, then the sun\nwithdraws its light. Where knowledge is, can ignorance endure? p. 85 If there\nbe ignorance, then knowledge must die.  \nIf there be lust, how can love be there? Where there is love, there is no\nlust.\n\nLay hold on your sword, and join in the fight. Fight, O my brother, as long as\nlife lasts.  \nStrike off your enemy\'s head, and there make an end of him quickly: then come,\nand bow your head at your King\'s Durbar.  \nHe who is brave, never forsakes the battle: he who flies from it is no true\nfighter.  \nIn the field of this body a great war goes forward, against passion, anger,\npride, and greed:  \nIt is in the kingdom of truth, contentment and purity, that this battle is\nraging; and the sword that rings forth most loudly is the sword of His Name.\np. 86  \nKabir says: "When a brave knight takes the field, a host of cowards is put to\nflight.  \nIt is a hard fight and a weary one, this fight of the truth-seeker: for the\nvow of the truth-seeker is more hard than that of the warrior, or of the\nwidowed wife who would follow her husband.  \nFor the warrior fights for a few hours, and the widow\'s struggle with death is\nsoon ended:  \nBut the truth-seeker\'s battle goes on day and night, as long as life lasts it\nnever ceases."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXXVIII](sok039.htm)\n\n'
