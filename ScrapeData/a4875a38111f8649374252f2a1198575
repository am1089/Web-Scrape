At first they occupied\nthe Punjab, but ere the Rigvedic period was ended they had reached the banks\nof the Jumna and the Ganges in the "Middle Country". In the early hymns the\ngreat Himalayan mountains dominate fertile river valleys, but the greater part\nof northern India is covered by vast and dense forests. No mention is made of\nthe sea.\n\nThe Aryans were a pastoral and hunting people, with some knowledge of\nagriculture. They possessed large herds of cattle, and had also sheep, goats,\nand asses; they were, besides, famous breeders and tamers of horses; the\nfaithful dog, man\'s earliest friend, followed both herds-man and hunter. The\nplough was in use, and bullocks were yoked to it; grain was thrashed in\nprimitive manner\n\np. 77\n\nand ground between "pounding stones". Barley and wheaten cakes, milk, curds,\nbutter, and cheese, and wild fruits were the chief articles of diet; the\nproducts of the chase were also eaten, but there appears to have been at the\nearliest period a restriction in the consumption of certain foods. Beef was\nnot eaten at meals. Bulls were sacrificed to the gods. Two kinds of\nintoxicating liquors were brewed--the mysterious Soma, beloved by deities, and\na mead or ale called "sura", the Avestan "hura", prepared probably from grain,\nwhich had ever an evil reputation as a cause of peace-breaking, like dice, and\nof wrongdoing generally.\n\nMetals were in use, for the earliest Aryan invasion took place in the Bronze\nAge, during which there were great race movements and invasions and conquests\nin Asia and in Europe. It is doubtful whether or not iron was known by the\nearliest Aryan settlers in India; it was probably not worked, but may have\nbeen utilized for charms, as in those countries in which meteoric iron was\ncalled "the metal of heaven". The knowledge of the mechanical arts had\nadvanced beyond the primitive stage. Warriors fought not only on foot but also\nin chariots, and they wore breastplates; their chief weapons were bows and\nhorn or metal-tipped arrows, maces, battleaxes, swords, and spears. Smiths\nroused their fires with feather fans; carpenters are mentioned in the hymns,\nand even barbers who used razors.\n\nThe father was the head of the family, and the family was the tribal unit. War\nwas waged by a loose federation of small clans, each of which was\ndistinguished by the name of a patriarch. The necessity of having to conduct\nfrequent campaigns in a new country, peopled by hostile aliens, no doubt\ntended to weld tribal units into small kingdoms and to promote the monarchic\nsystem. But\n\np. 78\n\nintertribal feuds were frequent and bitter. The Aryans of the Punjab, like the\nGauls who settled in northern Italy, and the clans of the Scottish Highlands\nin the Middle Ages, were continually divided among themselves, and greatly\noccupied in subduing rivals and in harrying their cattle.\n\nVillages were protected by stockades or earthworks against the attacks of\nenemies and wild beasts, or they contained strongholds. They were governed by\nheadsmen, who were, no doubt, military leaders also; disputes were settled by\na judge. Land, especially grazing land, appears to have been held in common by\ncommunities, but there are indications that cultivated plots and houses were\nowned by families and ultimately by individuals, the father in such cases\nbeing the supreme authority. Village communities, however, might be migratory,\nand certain of them may have had seasonal areas of settlement.\n\nPermanent villages existed in groups and also at some distance from one\nanother, and were connected by roads, and one clan might embrace several\nseparate communities. Trade was conducted by barter, the cow being the\nstandard of value, but in time jewels and gold ornaments were used like money\nfor purchases; "nishka", a necklet, afterwards signified a coin. Foreign\ntraders were not unknown at an early period. The use of alphabetic signs\nappears to have been introduced by Semites before the close of the Vedic\nperiod; from these evolved ultimately the scientific Sanskrit alphabet and\ngrammar.\n\nIn the Iranian period 1 there were social divisions of the people, but the\nhereditary system does not appear to have obtained until the close of Rigvedic\ntimes. Kings might be elected, or a military aristocracy might impose its sway\nover an area; a priest was originally a poet or\n\np. 79\n\nleader of thought, or a man of elevated character, like the Scottish Highland\n_duine-usual_ , the "upwardly man", who might be the son of a chief or of the\nhumblest member of a community.\n\nThe earliest Aryan divisions of society were apparently marked by occupations.\nAt first there were three grades: warriors, priests, and traders, but all\nclasses might engage in agricultural pursuits; even in the Epic period princes\ncounted and branded cattle. In the later Vedic age, however, a rigid system of\ncastes came into existence, the result, apparently, of having to distinguish\nbetween Aryans and aborigines at first, and subsequently between the various\ndegrees of Aryans who had intermarried with aliens. Caste (Varna) signifies\ncolour, and its relation to occupation is apparent in the four divisions--\nBrahmans, priests; Kshatriyas, the military aristocracy; Vaisyas, commoners,\nworkers, and traders, who were freemen; and Sudras, slaves and aborigines. In\nthe _Yajurveda_ , the third Veda, the caste system is found established on a\nhereditary basis. The three upper castes, which were composed of Aryans only,\npartook in all religious ceremonials, but the members of the Sudra caste were\nhedged about by severe restrictions. The knowledge of the Vedas was denied to\nthem, and they were not allowed to partake of Soma offerings, and although in\nthe process of time their position improved somewhat in the religious life of\nthe mingled people, their social inferiority was ever emphasized; they might\nbecome traders, but never Kshatriyas or Brahmans.\n\nThe most renowned of early Brahmans were the Rishis, the poets 1 who composed\nthe "new songs" to the\n\np. 80\n\ngods. They were regarded as divinely inspired men and their fame was\nperpetuated after death. Several renowned poets are referred to in sacred\nliterature and invested with great sanctity. The hymns or mantras were\ncommitted to memory and then handed down from generation to generation. At\nreligious ceremonies these were chanted by reciters, the Hotri priests. There\nwere also priests who were skilled in the correct performance of sacrificial\nrites, and family priests, the Purohitas, who were the guides, philosophers,\nand friends of kings and noblemen. A Rishi might be a Purohita and a seer, who\nensured by the performance of mystic ceremonies a monarch\'s success in battle\nand afterwards celebrated his achievements in song.\n\nIn the process of time an organized priesthood carne into existence, and a\nclan or kingdom had its chief priest. The production of new hymns came to an\nend; those which existed were considered sufficient for all purposes;\nreligious beliefs were systematized, and an arbitrary ritual became more and\nmore complicated.\n\nThere are indications that at an early period a chief or king might offer up a\nsacrifice, but when the profession of the Brahman became hereditary, no rite\ncould be performed unless presided over by holy men. A sacrifice might be\nrendered futile by an error in the construction of an altar, or in the order\nof ceremonial practices, or by failure to select appropriate chants. The\nAsuras and Rakshasas and other demons were ever hovering round the altar,\nendeavouring to obstruct ceremonies and to take advantage of ritualistic\nerrors to intercept offerings intended for the gods. It was by making\nsacrifices that man was believed to obtain power over the gods, or magical\ncontrol over the forces of nature.\n\nFor the performance of some sacrifices a day of preparation\n\n\n\n[![GROUP OF PRESENT-DAY BRAHMANS<br> photo.

Altars had to be erected with mathematical exactness; the\nstones were blessed and anointed; offerings were made at every stage of the\nwork so that the various deities might give protection in their various\nspheres. The following extract from one of the Brahmanas affords a glimpse of\nthe preparatory rites:--\n\nThrice he (the priest) perambulates it (the altar); for thrice he walks round\nit (whilst sprinkling); thus as many times as he walks round it, so many times\ndoes he perambulate it. . . .\n\nHaving thereupon put that stone into the water pitcher, (he) throws it in that\n(south-westerly) direction, for that is Nirriti\'s region; he thus consigns\npain to Nirriti\'s region. . . .\n\nOutside the fire altars he throws it, &c. 1\n\nHuman failings may be imputed to Brahmans, but it must be recognized that the\nideals of their caste were of a high order. They were supposed to be born with\n"spiritual lustre", and their lives were consecrated to the instruction and\nuplifting of mankind and the attainment of salvation. A Brahman\'s life was\ndivided into four periods. The first was the period of childhood, and the\nsecond was the period of probation, when he went to live in a forest\nhermitage, where he acted as the servant of a revered old sage, his spiritual\nfather, and received instruction in Brahmanic knowledge for a number of years.\nDuring the third period the Brahman lived the worldly life; he married and\nreared a family and performed the duties pertaining to his caste. Hospitality\nwas one of the chief worldly duties; if a stranger, even although he might be\nan enemy, came and asked for food he received it, although the Brahman family\nshould have to fast to supply him. In the fourth period the Brahman, having\nproved himself a faithful husband and exemplary father,\n\np. 82\n\ndivided his worldly possessions between his grown-up sons and daughters; then\nhe abandoned his comfortable home and, assuming the deerskin clothing of\nhermits, went to live in a lonely forest, or among the Himalayan mountains, to\nprepare for the coming of death, far away from the shadows cast by sin and\nsorrow. In solitude he performed rigid penances and addressed himself with\nsingle-minded devotion to the contemplation of spiritual problems. Subduing\nthe five senses, he attained to the state of Yoga (concentration). Placing his\nmind entirely upon the contemplation of the soul, he became united ultimately\nwith the World Soul (God), thus obtaining the release which was Salvation.\nSome Brahmans were teachers who instructed pupils and composed the sacred\nwritings. The forest hermitages were the universities of ancient India.\n\nThe profession of the priesthood had certainly its mercenary aspect;\nsacrificial fees were fixed as well as sacrificial rites, and a not\nunimportant part of a ceremony was the offering of generous gifts to the\nBrahmans, who presided at the altar. But on the whole the riches thus expended\nwere not given in vain. As in Egypt, the rise and endowment of the priestly\ncult was due to the accumulation of wealth which enabled a section of society\nto find leisure for study and the promotion of culture. Aryan civilization in\nIndia owed much to the Brahmans. They introduced and elaborated alphabetic\nsigns; the devoted scholars among them compiled the first Sanskrit grammar and\nstudied the art of composition. Among the hermits there were great and\noriginal thinkers who laid the basis of Indian metaphysical thought, and rose\nfrom the materialism of the early Vedic hymns to the idealism of the\nspeculative prose works, which included the _Forest Books_ , a name redolent\nof leafy solitude and of simple\n\n\n\n[![SADHUS \\(RELIGIOUS MENDICANTS\\) AT BENARES](tn/08200.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/08200.jpg)  \nSADHUS (RELIGIOUS MENDICANTS) AT BENARES  \n\n\n\np. 83\n\nand contemplative lives on the banks of sweetly-flowing waters. Even their\ndevotion to the mysteries of sacrificial ritual, which became more and more\ncomplicated, was not unproductive of permanent benefits to mankind. The\nnecessity for the exact construction of altars, and the observance of\nceremonies in due season, promoted the study of mathematical science. These\nBrahmans invented the numerical figures which have attained universal usage,\nand in time they gave the world Algebra. The influence of their culture may be\ntraced in other directions. At the present day it has indirectly brought into\nexistence the science of Comparative Religion.\n\nAt the close of the Rigvedic period the Aryans had extended their sway to the\ndistrict known as Madhyadesa, the "middle country", between the "Five Rivers"\nof the Punjab and the upper reaches of the Jumna and Ganges. Pioneers were\nmeantime pressing southward and eastward towards the sea. Migrations were, no\ndoubt, due to propulsion as well as attraction; fresh folk-waves probably\npoured in periodically from the north-west, while the settled population must\nhave increased rapidly in the fertile land controlled by the invaders, to whom\nthe aborigines offered but slight resistance.\n\nThe second Vedic book, the _Samaveda_ , does not contain much fresh material:\nit is mainly a compilation of the Rigvedic hymns which the priests chanted at\nthe Soma sacrifice. Its sole interest, from a historical point of view, is the\nevidence it affords of the steady growth of ritualistic tendencies. A new era\nof Aryan civilization is revealed, however, by the third Veda, the\n_Yajurveda_. In this book the tribes are found to have extended their area of\ncontrol down the Ganges valley, and southward along the banks of the Indus. It\nis of interest to note here that the word "Samudra", first applied to the\nbroadening Indus where\n\np. 84\n\nit receives its tributaries, and signifying "collected waters" became in the\n_Brahmanas_ the name of the world-encircling ocean, across which in due time\nloomed the ships which "once in three years" carried to Solomon\'s order "gold,\nand silver, ivory (or elephants\' tusks), and apes, and peacocks". 1\n\nIn the _Yajurveda_ we find that Aryan civilization has developed greatly in\nthe course of three or four centuries. Powerful tribes have established\nkingdoms, and small states are being subjected to the larger. The hardened\nsystem of social organization is reflected by the references to the four\ndistinct castes. Hitherto the Kshatriyas have controlled the destinies of the\npeople, but now the Brahmans achieve an intellectual conquest and impose their\nsway over kings and nobles. The holy men are no longer the humble servants of\ngenerous patrons; they are the human representatives of the all-controlling\ndeities. "Verily, there are two kinds of gods; for the gods themselves,\nassuredly, are gods, and those priests who have studied and teach Vedic lore,\nare the human gods."\n\nThe offerings to the deities are "consecrated by the feeding of priests". 2\n\nEven the gods become dependent upon the priests, who provided them by offering\nsacrifices with the "food" they required, and also with the Soma which gave\nthem length of years. Indra could not combat against the Asuras without the\nassistance of the priests who chanted formulas to ensure victory; it was,\ntherefore, due to the power exercised, in the first place, by the priests that\nthe drought demon was overcome and rain fell in abundance.\n\nPriests might also accumulate in heaven credit balances\n\n\n\n[![A YOGI ON A BED OF SPIKES<br> <i>An example of present-day\nausterities</i>.](tn/08400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/08400.jpg)  \nA YOGI ON A BED OF SPIKES  \n_An example of present-day austerities_.  \n\n\n\np. 85\n\nof Celestial power by undergoing penances for long periods. A heavy debt was\nalso due to them by the gods for their sacrificial offerings. When a Brahman\ndesired to exercise his accumulated power, he might even depose the deities,\nwho were therefore placed under compulsion to fulfil his demands; his\nCelestial credit might exceed the "paying" possibilities of the supreme\nPowers. In the sacred tales Brahmans were credited with performing rigid\npenances for centuries.\n\nIn the fourth Veda, the _Atharva-veda_ , the revival of belief in formulas is\nemphasized. This book, which did not receive recognition as an inspired work\nat first, is in the main a collection of metrical charms of great antiquity.\nMany resemble closely those which have been collected by folk-lorists during\nlate years in the Scottish Highlands and elsewhere throughout Europe. The\nRigveda hymns reveal the religious beliefs and aspirations of the advanced\nthinkers of their age; the _Atharva-veda_ contains the germs of folk religion\n--the magical formulas chanted to dispel or invoke the vague spirits who\nhelped or thwarted mankind. It teaches that the Universe is upheld by\nsacrifice and the spiritual exaltation of Brahmans, and that Brahmanic power\nmay be exercised by the use of appropriate charms. Human beings might also be\ninfluenced by the Spirits invoked by means of formulas.\n\nPrimitive man believed that all emotions were caused by spirits. When the poet\nsang, he was "inspired"--he drew in a spirit; ecstasy was "a standing outside\nof oneself", the soul having escaped temporarily from the body. Wrath was\ncaused by a demon, and "battle fury" by the spirit of war which possessed the\nwarrior. When a human being was "seized" by a fit, his convulsions were\nbelieved to be caused by the demon who had entered his body. Love was\ninspiration in the literal sense, and an\n\np. 86\n\n[paragraph continues] Indian lover might compel a heedless lady to regard him\nwith favour by reciting an Atharva-vedic spell. Apparently the love spirit had\na weakness for honey. The lover chanted:\n\nHoney be mine at the tip of my tongue,  \nMay sweetness of honey pervade my speech,  \nSo that my love may come under my spell--  \nSo that my lady may yield to my will.  \n                                   _Atharva-veda_ , i, 34.\n\nAs the grass is shorn from earth by the wind,  \nSo may thy soul be shorn to my will,  \nAnd then, O lady, thou\'lt give me thy love,  \nNor be averse to me as thou wert.  \n                                   _Atharva-veda_ , ii, 30.\n\nA lover, we find, can invoke the lady to embrace him "as the creeper embraces\na tree"; if she clings to his arm he can cause her to cling to his heart; his\ninfluence over her mind is like the influence of a wing-beating eagle over the\nwind. It may be, too, that a neglected girl finds it necessary to prepare a\nlove potion with "salve, sweet wood, and spikenard", and to cause the heart of\nan ungallant swain to suffer from "a parching heart", which "languishes for\nlove", and experiences the "yearning of the Apsaras".\n\nWarriors were charmed against spells, cattle and sheep were charmed against\nwild beasts, a house was charmed against evil spirits and demons. 1 Greedy\ndemons of disease, who devoured the flesh of patients, were greatly feared:\nBrahmans performed ceremonies of riddance and\n\np. 87\n\n[paragraph continues] "plagued them as the tiger plagues the cattle owners .\nThe following is a charm against cough:\n\nAs the soul with the soul\'s desires swiftly to a distance flies,  \nThus do thou, O cough, fly forth along the soul\'s course of flight.  \nAs a well-sharpened arrow swiftly to a distance flies,  \nThus do thou, O cough, fly forth along the expanse of the earth.  \nAs the rays of the sun swiftly to a distance fly,  \nThus do thou, O cough, fly forth along the flood of the sea.  \n                                     _Atharva-veda_ , vi, 105. 1\n\nA Scottish Highland charm similarly invokes the Powers, or the "King of the\nElements":\n\nTo cause the wrath of men to ebb,  \nLike to a wave from the sea to the floodtide,  \nAnd a wave from the floodtide to the ebb.\n\nOccasionally a mantra is infused with high religious fervour. A Brahman might\npray:\n\nFrom the sins which knowingly or unknowingly we have committed, do ye, all\ngods, of one accord release us.  \nIf awake or asleep, to sin inclined, I have committed a sin, may what has\nbeen, and what shall be, as if from a wooden post, release me.\n_Atharva-veda_ , vi, 115. 1-2. 2\n\nAnother hymn of this character concludes:\n\nIn heaven, where our righteous friends are blessed,  \nHaving cast off diseases from their bodies,  \nFrom lameness free and not deformed in members,  \nThere may we see our parents and our children.  \n                                _Atharva-veda_ , vi, 120. 3\n\nWhile the tribes were spreading southward and eastward,\n\np. 88\n\n[paragraph continues] Madhyadesa, the "middle country", remained the centre of\nBrahmanic culture. In that district came into existence the earliest sacred\nprose works which constitute the basis of classic Hinduism. The first were the\noldest _Brahmanas_ ; these comment on and expound the doctrines of the Vedic\nhymns, especially in their relation to the ritual of sacrifices. To the\nBrahmanas were added the _Aran \xc2\xb4yakas_, "forest books", which are more\nspeculative in tendency. The expository appendices to the _Aran \xc2\xb4yakas_ are\ncalled the _Upanishads_ , "the sittings down", or "the sessions"--the pupil\nsat at his master\'s feet--and in these a high level of thought is attained.\n"For the first time", says Professor Macdonell, "we find the Absolute grasped\nand proclaimed."\n\nAll the tribes were not infused with the same degree of culture. In the\n_Yajur-veda_ period there were various schools of thought, and these continued\nto exercise their influence into historic times, even after Upanishadic\ndoctrines became widespread.\n\nEre we deal, however, with the new theological doctrines of the Brahmanic\nteachers, we should follow the development of sacrificial practices, because\nfrom these evolved the bold Pantheism which characterized the conception of\nthe World Soul, Brahma.\n\nThe two greatest sacrifices were the _purusha-medha_ , the human sacrifice,\nand _aswa-medha_ , the sacrifice of the horse. Both were prevalent in early\ntimes, and in simpler form than they survive to us in the doctrinal works and\nthe Epics. A human sacrifice was believed to be of highest potency, but it\nbecame extremely rare, as in Egypt, among the ruling and cultured classes. It\nwas perpetuated in India, however, until about half a century ago, by the\nDravidian Khonds in Bengal and Madras, and had to be suppressed by British\nofficers.\n\np. 89\n\n[paragraph continues] Human sacrifices, in historic times, were "offered to\nthe earth goddess, Tari Pennu or Bera Pennu, and were believed to ensure good\ncrops, and immunity from all diseases and accidents". One official record\nstates that the victim, after being stabbed by the priest, was "literally cut\nto pieces". Each person who was "so fortunate as to procure it carried away a\nmorsel of the flesh, and presented it to the idol of his own village". 1\n\nFrom the practice of sacrificing human beings arose the conception that the\nfirst act of Creation was, if not human sacrifice, at least the sacrifice of\nthe first being with human attributes. The Universe is the giant Purusha\n("man"); he is "all that hath been and shall be". In a Rigvedic hymn, which is\nregarded as being of later composition than the Rigvedic period, it is set\nforth:\n\n"When the gods performed a sacrifice with Purusha as the oblation, the Spring\nwas its butter, the Summer its fuel, and the Autumn its (accompanying)\noffering. This victim, Purusha, born in the beginning, they immolated on the\nsacrificial grass."\n\nFrom this universal sacrifice issued forth all that exists. The Brahman rose\nfrom Purusha\'s mouth, the Rajanya (Kshatriya) from his arms, the Vaisya from\nhis thighs, and the Sudra sprang from his feet. Indra and Agni came from his\nmouth, and Vayu from his breath.\n\n"When the gods, performing sacrifice, bound Purusha as a victim, there were\nseven sticks (stuck up) for it (around the fire). . . . With sacrifice the\ngods performed the sacrifice. These were the earliest rites." 2\n\n"From his (Purusha\'s) navel arose the air, from his head the sky, from his\nears the four quarters; in this\n\np. 90\n\nmanner (the gods) formed the worlds." This conception resembles closely the\nstory in Teutonic mythology of the cutting up by the gods of the body of the\nchaos giant Ymer; his skull became the sky, his bones the rocks, his blood the\nsea, and so on. One of the Chinese P\'an Ku 1 myths is of similar character;\nthe world is composed of different parts of his body. The Babylonian Merodach\nalso divided the body of the chaos demon, Tiawath or Tiamat; her head became\nthe sky, her body the earth, and her blood the rivers which fill the sea.\nPurusha, the chaos giant of India, had "a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and\na thousand feet"; the earth was equal to the space covered by ten of his\nfingers; he was "the whole universe".\n\nThe horse sacrifice was also infused, like the human sacrifice, with symbolic\nsignificance. It was probably practised in the early Iranian period by the\nAryan horse tamers, who may have substituted man\'s fleet-footed friend for\nhuman beings. The Mongolian Buriats in the vicinity of Lake Baikal, Siberia,\nare the latest surviving sacrificers of the domesticated animal. Their horse\nsacrifice (Tailgan) was held on 2 August on a sacred hill inhabited by their\ngods, the Burkans, "the masters". The horse was bound, thrown upon its back\nand held tightly by ropes, while the officiating person cut open its breast\nand pulled out the pulsating heart like the sacrificers of human beings in\nAncient Mexico. The animal\'s bones were burned on the altars, and the flesh\nwas cooked and devoured by the worshippers. Portions of the flesh, and some of\nthe broth prepared, were given to the flames, which also received libations of\nthe liquor called _tarasun_ , distilled from soul milk. _Tarasun_ was\n\np. 91\n\nthe Soma of the Buriats, and their fire spirit was, like the Indian Agni, a\nready drinker of it. Bits of food were also flung to aerial spirits, while\noblations were poured on the hill, the belief prevailing that these offerings\nmultiplied sufficiently to permit of the gods feeding sumptuously. As each of\nthe worshippers of the spirits of nature accepted a portion of sacrificial\nfood, a prayer was chanted, entreating the gods to cause increase of all\nthings.\n\n"Let our villages be one verst longer," they said; "create cattle in our\nenclosures; under our blankets create a son; send down rain from high heaven\nto us; cause much grass to grow; create so much grain that the sickle cannot\nraise it, and so much grass that the scythe cannot cut it."\n\nAfter the sacrifice, the food was divided and the fragments that remained were\ncarefully burned, "for none of it must be eaten by dogs; that would be\ndesecration, and misfortune would follow in its wake". 1\n\nThe purpose of this annual sacrifice was evidently to secure fertility and\nprosperity generally, and we refer to it here so fully because of the light it\nthrows on the Indian ceremonial which it resembles closely in some of its\ndetails.\n\nThere are two direct references to the horse sacrifice in the _Rigveda_. 2 The\nanimal is "covered with rich trappings" and led thrice round the altar. It is\naccompanied by a goat, which is killed first to "announce the sacrifice to the\ngods". A goat was also slain at a burial to inform the gods that the soul was\nabout to enter Heaven.\n\nIn the _Story of Nala_ and in the _Ram ayana_, the horse\n\np. 92\n\nsacrifice is performed to secure human offspring. A second _Ram ayana_ horse\nsacrifice is offered as an atonement after the slaying of the demon Ravana. An\nelaborate account of this great ceremonial is also given in the _Mah\nabharata_. It was performed after "the great war" on the advice of the sage\nVyasa to atone for the slaying of kinsmen. The horse was let loose and an army\nfollowed it. Whichever country the animal entered had to be conquered for the\nowner of the horse, so that only a powerful monarch could fulfil the\nconditions of the sacrifice. A hundred such sacrifices might enable a king to\ndepose Indra.\n\nIt is significant, however, that the animal was released to wander from\nkingdom to kingdom on the night of the full moon in the spring month of\nChoitro, and that it returned in the following year at the close of the winter\nseason. When the ground was prepared by being ploughed by the king, the queen\nfollowed him, sowing the seeds of every kind of vegetable and curative herb\nwhich grew in the kingdom. A countless number of representative animals were\nsacrificed before the sacred horse was slain, the rain drum and trumpet were\nsounded, and the king and queen were drenched with holy water.\n\nThe flesh of the horse was cooked and eaten, and Indra and the other gods\nappeared and partook of their portions. Pieces were also flung in the fire,\nand the fire received also its meed of Soma. When the sacrifice was completed,\nthe king divided the herb offerings among the people; what remained over was\nburned.\n\nIn the _Mah abharata_ a white horse is sacrificed, but in the _Ram ayana_ a\nblack victim is offered up. White horses were sacrificed to Mars by the\nRomans; the Greeks sacrificed white horses to the sun by throwing\n\np. 93\n\nthen in the sea; the Spartans offered up their horses, like the Buriats, on a\nhilltop.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the Greek and Roman horse sacrifices were also\nintended to ensure fertility. A horse was offered up to Diana at the August\nharvest festival, and we know that that popular goddess gave plentiful crops\nand was the guardian of flocks and herds and wild animals of the chase; she\nalso presided at birth, and women invoked her aid. Virgins and youths took a\nprominent part at this harvest festival. The Roman horse sacrifice took place\non 15 October. The animal was offered to Mars; the head was conveyed to the\nking\'s house 1 and decorated with loaves, and the blood was preserved until\nApril, when it was mixed by virgins with the blood of calves; this mixture was\ngiven to shepherds to ensure the increase of flocks which were fumigated. In\nthe _Mah abharata_ the king and the princes stand for a time in the smoke\nbelching from the altar, to be cleansed of their sins.\n\nThe Persians, and other peoples of Aryan speech and custom, sacrificed horses\nregularly. But the custom was not confined to Indo-Europeans. The Scythians, 2\nwho were probably Mongols, not only offered horses to the Spirit of Fertility,\nbut also, like the Buriats, to the dead. The Patagonians sacrificed horses to\ntree spirits. In this connection it may be noted that some European horse\nsacrifices took place in sacred groves; the Buriats tied their horse to a\nbirch tree, which was carried to the mountain top and fixed to a stake; the\nIndian sacrificial posts were probably substitutes for trees.\n\nIn the _Upanishads_ the sacrifice of the horse is infused, as we have\nindicated, with mystic symbolism. We read:\n\np. 94\n\n[paragraph continues] "The dawn in truth is the head of the sacrificial horse,\nThe sun is the eye; the wind the breath . . . the year the body, the heaven is\nthe back . . . the constellations the bones; the sky the muscles; the rivers,\narteries and veins; the liver and spleen, the mountains; the herbs and trees,\nthe various kinds of hair." The horse is also identified with the sun: "The\nsun, as long as he rises is the fore part of the body; the sun, as long as he\ndescends is the hind part of the body, &c." The horse is also day and night in\nturn, and its birthplace is the sea; it carries the gods and the Asuras; it is\nthe symbol of Death, "who is voracity", from whom all things came. "There was\nnot anything here before." Death first "created this mind, desiring, _May I\nhave a soul_. He went forth worshipping. From him, when worshipping, the\nwaters were produced. . . . The froth of the waters which was there became\nconsistent. This became the earth. . . . He made himself threefold. His\neastern quarter is the head . . . his western quartet is the tail, &c."\n\nThe work of Creation proceeds, and then "he (Death as the Creator) resolved to\ndevour all that he had created; for he eats all. . . . He is the eater of the\nwhole universe; this whole universe is his food."\n\nAfter a year of purification the Creator slaughtered his horse body. "He gave\nup the animal to the gods. Therefore they (the gods) slaughter the purified\nanimal, representing in its nature, as Prajapati, all deities. He (the\nCreator) is the Ashwameda 1 who shines."\n\nThe gods performed the sacrifice to overcome the demons, the representatives\nof sin. Therefore the horse sacrifice removes all sin.\n\nAfter much fantastic symbolism the following lesson\n\np. 95\n\nin the form of a mantra is extracted from the parable of Creation:--\n\n"From the unreal lead me to the real, from darkness lead me to light, from\ndeath lead me to immortality."\n\nThe Upanishadic treatment of the Purusha myth differs somewhat from the Vedic,\nand is intended to strengthen the Monotheistic tendencies displayed in some of\nthe hymns.\n\nWhen the Universal soul, according to this later doctrine, took at the\nbeginning "the shape of a man" . . . he "beheld nothing but himself".\n\n"He said first _This, I am_. Hence the name of \'I\' was produced. Therefore,\neven now a man, when called, says first, \'It is I\', and tells afterwards any\nother name that belongs to him. And, because He, as the first of all of them\nconsumed by fire all the sins, therefore he is called Purusha. . . .\n\nHe was afraid; therefore man, when alone, is afraid. He then looked round.\nSince nothing but myself exists, of whom should I be afraid? Hence his fear\ndeparted; for whom should he fear, since fear arises from another.\n\nHe did not feel delight. Therefore nobody, when alone, feels delight. He was\ndesirous of a second. He was in the same state as husband (Pati) and wife\n(Patni). . . . He divided this self twofold. Hence were husband and wife\nproduced. Therefore was this only a half of himself, as a split pea is of the\nwhole. . . . This void is thus completed by woman. He approached her. Hence\nmen were born."\n\nThe first two "mortals" then assumed the forms of all creatures, male and\nfemale in turn. They were, in order, the first cattle, the first horses, the\nfirst asses, the first goats, the first sheep, and so on. "In this manner He\ncreated every living pair whatsoever down to the ants." Then he reflected and\nsaid: "I am verily this creation, for I created this all."\n\np. 96\n\nThe lesson then follows. Men say, "Sacrifice to this, sacrifice to this,\nsacrifice to one or the other god?" But these words are "not proper", because\n"He is really this creation; for he verily is all the gods".\n\nThus the first Being, as a commentator remarked, "whose nature comprehended\nall elements, who is eternal, who is not conceived by thought, sprang forth by\nhimself. . . . He consumed all sins, for unless one is in a worldly state he\ncannot consume sins. . . . Being mortal he created immortals." 1\n\nFrom the myth of the chaos-giant Purusha we pass to the higher pantheistic\nconception of Brahm\xc4\x83, the soul of the Universe.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[78:1](iml10.htm#fr_128) A convenient term as explained in our Introduction.\n\n[79:1](iml10.htm#fr_129) "A Rishi, \'seer\', is primarily a composer of hymns. .\n. .
