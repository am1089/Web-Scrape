Now the\nmiddle Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis is Vayu 1, for Vayu (the wind) is all the light in\nthe air-world: it is Vayu he thus places therein. He places it so as not to be\nseparated from the regional (bricks): he thus places Vayu in the regions, and\nhence there is wind in all the regions.\n\n8:3:2:22\\. And, again, as to why he lays down the Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis,--the Vi\n_s_ va _g_ yotis, doubtless, is offspring (or creatures), for offspring indeed\nis all the light: he thus lays generative power (into that world). He places\nit so as not to be separated from the regional ones 2: he thus places\ncreatures in the regions, and hence there are creatures in all the regions.\n\n8:3:2:33\\. [He lays it down, with, Va _g_. S. XIV, 14], \'May Vi _s_ vakarman\nsettle thee!\' for Vi _s_ vakarman saw this third layer 3;--\'on the back of the\nair, thee the brilliant one!\' for on the back of the air that brilliant Vayu\nindeed is.\n\n8:3:2:44\\. \'For all up-breathing, down-breathing, through-breathing,\'--for the\nVi _s_ va _g_ yotis is breath,\n\np. 48\n\nand breath indeed is (necessary) for this entire universe;--\'give all the\nlight!\'--that is, \'give the whole light;\'--\'Vayu is thine over-lord,\'--it is\nVayu he thus makes the over-lord of that (layer and the air-world). Having\nsettled it, he pronounces the Sudadohas over it: the significance of this has\nbeen explained.\n\n8:3:2:55\\. He then lays down two Ritavya (seasonal 1 bricks);--the two\nseasonal ones being the same as the seasons, it is the seasons he thus places\ntherein.[Va _g_. S. XIV, 15], \'Nabha and Nabhasya, the two rainy seasons,\'\nthese are the names of those two (bricks): it is by their names he thus lays\nthem down. There are two (such) bricks, for a season consists of two months.\nHe settles them once only: he thereby makes (the two months) one season. He\nplaces them on avaka-plants and covers them\n\np. 49\n\nwith avaka-plants 1; for avaka-plants mean water he thus bestows water on that\nseason, whence it rains most abundantly in that season.\n\n8:3:2:66\\. Then the two upper ones, with (Va _g_. S. XIV, I6), \'Isha and \xc3\x9br\n_g_ a, the two autumnal seasons,\'--these are the names of those two (bricks):\nit is by their names he thus lays them down. There are two (such) bricks, for\na season consists of two months. He settles them only once: he thereby makes\n(the two months) one season. He places them on avaka-plants, for the avaka-\nplants mean water: he thus bestows water before that season, whence it rains\nbefore that season. He does not cover them afterwards, whence it does not\nlikewise rain after (that season).\n\n8:3:2:77\\. And as to why he places these (four bricks) in this (layer),--this\nfire-altar is the year, and the year is the same as these worlds, and the\nmiddlemost layer is the air (-world) thereof; and the rainy season and autumn\nare the air (-world) thereof: hence when he places them in this (layer), he\nthereby restores to him (Agni) what (part) of his body these (formed),--this\nis why he places them in this (layer).\n\n8:3:2:88\\. And, again, as to why he places them in this (layer),--this Agni\n(the fire-altar) is Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is the year. Now the\nmiddlemost layer is the middle of this (altar), and the rainy season and the\nautumn are the middle of that (year): hence when he places them in this\n(layer), he thereby restores to him (Agni-Pra _g_ apati) what part of his\n\np. 50\n\nbody these (formed),--this is why he places them in this (layer).\n\n8:3:2:99\\. There are here four seasonal (bricks) he lays down in the\nmiddlemost layer; and two in each of the other layers,--animals (cattle) are\nfour-footed, and the middlemost layer is the air: he thus places animals in\nthe air, and hence there are animals that have their abode in the air.\n\n8:3:2:1010\\. And, again, why there are four,--animals are four-footed, and\nanimals are food; and the middle-most layer is the middle (of Agni\'s body): he\nthus puts food in the middle.\n\n8:3:2:1111\\. And, again, why there are four,--\'antariksha\' (air) consists of\nfour syllables, and the other layers ( _k_ iti) consist of two syllables;\nhence as much as the air consists of, so much he makes it in laying it down.\n\n8:3:2:1212\\. And, again, why there are four,--this Agni (altar), doubtless, is\nan animal: he thus makes the animal biggest towards the middle; whence an\nanimal is biggest towards the middle.\n\n8:3:2:1313\\. There are here four _Ri_ tavyas, the Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis being\nthe fifth, and five Di _s_ yas,--this makes ten: the Vira _g_ consists of ten\nsyllables, and the Vira _g_ is food, and the middlemost layer is the\nmiddle;--he thus puts food in the middle (of the body). He lays them down so\nas not to be separated from the naturally-perforated one 1, for the naturally-\nperforated one is the vital air: he thus places the food so as not to be\nseparated from the vital air. Subsequently (to the central brick) he lays them\ndown: subsequently\n\np. 51\n\nto (or upon) the vital air he thus places food.\n\n8:3:2:1414\\. He then lays down the Pra _n_ abh _ri_ t 1 (bricks);--the Pra _n_\nabh _ri_ ts (breath-holders), doubtless, are the vital airs: it is the vital\nairs he thus lays into (Agni\'s body). There are ten of them, for there are ten\nvital airs. He places them in the forepart (of the altar),--for there are\nthese vital airs in front,--with (Va _g_. S. XIV, 17), \'Protect my vital\nstrength! protect mine up-breathing! protect my down-breathing! protect my\nthrough-breathing! protect mine eye! protect mine ear! increase my speech!\nanimate my mind! protect my soul (or body)! give me light!\'--He lays them down\nso as not to be separated from the seasonal ones, for the vital air is wind:\nhe thus establishes the wind in the seasons.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[47:1](sbe4312.htm#fr_114) The three Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis bricks, placed in\n(the fourth easterly place from the centre of) the first, third and fifth\nlayer respectively, are supposed to represent the regents of the three worlds\n--earth, air and sky--which these three layers represent, viz. Agni, Vayu and\n\xc3\x82ditya (Surya). See VI, 3, 3, 16.\n\n[47:2](sbe4312.htm#fr_115) Though, properly speaking, the Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis\nlies close to only one of the Di _s_ yas, viz. the eastern one, it may at any\nrate be said to lie close to the range of the Di _s_ yas. Here, too, the sense\n\'immediately after, not separated from them in respect of time,\' would suit\neven better.\n\n[47:3](sbe4312.htm#fr_116) See [VIII, 3, 1, 4](sbe4311.htm#8:3:1:4) with note.\n\n[48:1](sbe4312.htm#fr_117)\n\n![THE CENTRAL PART OF THE THIRD LAYER.](img/04800.jpg)  \nTHE CENTRAL PART OF THE THIRD LAYER.\n\nThese two _Ri_ tavyas are placed beside (east of) the Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis, one\nnorth of the other, just over those of the first and second layers, that is to\nsay, in the fifth space from the centre. In the present case, however, these\nbricks are only of half the usual thickness; two others, of similar size;\nbeing placed upon them.\n\n[49:1](sbe4312.htm#fr_118) As in the case of the live tortoise, in the first\nlayer; see VII, 5, 1, 11 with note--\'Blyxa octandra, a grassy plant growing in\nmarshy land ("lotus-flower," Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 250).\'\n\n[50:1](sbe4312.htm#fr_119) That is to say, the three sets of bricks are not\nseparated by any others from the Svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a.\n\n[51:1](sbe4312.htm#fr_120) The ten Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ts are placed--five on\neach side of the spine--either along the edge of the altar, or so as to leave\nthe space of one foot between them and the edge, to afford room for another\nset of bricks, the Valakhilyas.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 3, 3.
