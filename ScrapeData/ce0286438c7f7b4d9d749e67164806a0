Now at the house of Aru _n_ a Aupave _s_ i 1 these came once\ntogether,--Satyaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a Paulushi, Maha _s_ ala _G_ abala, Bu _d_ ila \xc3\x82\n_s_ vatara _s_ vi, Indradyumna Bhallaveya, and _G_ ana _s_ arkarakshya. They\ntook counsel together regarding (Agni) Vai _s_ vanara, but did not agree as to\nVai _s_ vanara 2.\n\n10:6:1:22\\. They said, 'There is that A _s_ vapati Kaikeya who knows Vai _s_\nvanara thoroughly 3: let us go to him!' They went to A _s_ vapati Kaikeya. He\nordered for them separate dwellings, separate honours, separate Soma-\nsacrifices each with a thousand gifts. In the morning, still at variance with\none another, they\n\np. 394\n\ncame again to him, with fuel in their hands 1, saying, 'We want to become thy\npupils.'\n\n10:6:1:33\\. He said, 'How is this, venerable sirs, when ye are learned in the\nscriptures, and sons of men learned in the scriptures?' They replied,\n'Venerable sir, thou knowest Vai _s_ vanara thoroughly: teach us him!' He\nsaid, 'I do indeed know Vai _s_ vanara thoroughly: put your fuel on (the\nfire), ye are become my pupils 2.'\n\n10:6:1:44\\. He then said to Aru _n_ a Aupave _s_ i, 'O Gautama, as whom\nknowest thou Vai _s_ vanara 3?'--'As Earth only, O king;' he replied.--'Yea,'\nhe said, 'that indeed is Vai _s_ vanara, the foundation; and because thou\nknowest the Vai _s_ vanara Foundation (pratish _th_ a) therefore thou art\nfirmly established (pratish _th_ ita) with offspring and cattle; and, verily,\nhe who knows that Vai _s_ vanara Foundation, repels Death and attains all\nlife. But, in truth, these are only the feet 4 of Vai _s_ vanara, and thy feet\nwould have withered away, hadst thou not come hither; or the feet would be\nunknown to thee, hadst thou not come hither 5.'\n\n10:6:1:55\\. He then said to Satyaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a Paulushi, 'O Pra _k_ inayogya,\nas whom knowest thou Vai _s_ vanara?'\n\np. 395\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--'As Water only, O king;' he replied.--'Yea,' he said,\n'that indeed is the Vai _s_ vanara Wealth; and because thou knowest that Vai\n_s_ vanara Wealth, therefore thou art wealthy and prosperous; and, verily, he\nwho knows that Vai _s_ vanara Wealth, repels death and attains all life. But,\nin truth, this is only the bladder of Vai _s_ vanara, and thy bladder would\nhave failed thee, hadst thou not come hither; or the bladder would be unknown\nto thee, hadst thou not come hither.'\n\n10:6:1:66\\. He then said to Maha _s_ ala _G_ abala, 'O Aupamanyava, as whom\nknowest thou Vai _s_ vanara?'--'As Ether only, O king,' he replied.--'Yea,' he\nsaid, 'that, indeed, is the Vai _s_ vanara Plenteous; and because thou knowest\nVai _s_ vanara Plenteous, therefore thou art plentiful in offspring and\ncattle; and, verily, he who knows that Vai _s_ vanara Plenteous, repels death\nand attains all life. But, in truth, this is only the trunk of Vai _s_ vanara,\nand thy trunk would have failed thee, hadst thou not come hither; or the body\nwould be unknown to thee, hadst thou not come hither.'\n\n10:6:1:77\\. He then said to [Budila](errata.htm#7) \xc3\x82 _s_ vatara _s_ vi, 'O\nVaiyaghrapadya, as whom knowest thou Vai _s_ vanara?'--'As Air (wind) only, O\nking;' he replied.--'Yea,' he\n\np. 396\n\nsaid, 'that indeed is the Vai _s_ vanara of divers courses; and because thou\nknowest that Vai _s_ vanara of divers courses, therefore divers rows of cars\nfollow thee; and, verily, he who knows that Vai _s_ vanara of divers courses,\nrepels death, and attains all life. But, in truth, this is only the breath of\nVai _s_ vanara, and thy breath would have failed thee, hadst thou not come\nhither; or the breath would be unknown to thee, hadst thou not come hither.'\n\n10:6:1:88\\. He then said to Indradyumna Bhallaveya, 'O Vaiyaghrapadya, as whom\nknowest thou Vai _s_ vanara?'--'As Sun only, O king,' he replied.--'Yea,' he\nsaid, 'that indeed is the Vai _s_ vanara of Soma's splendour 1; and because\nthou knowest the Vai _s_ vanara of Soma's splendour, therefore that Soma-juice\nnever fails to be consumed and cooked 2 in thy house; and, verily, he who\nknows that Vai _s_ vanara of Soma's splendour, repels death, and attains all\nlife. But, indeed, this is only the eye of Vai _s_ vanara, and thine eye would\nhave failed thee, hadst thou not come hither; or the eye would be unknown to\nthee, hadst thou not come hither.'\n\n10:6:1:99\\. He then said to _G_ ana _S_ arkarakshya, 'O Sayavasa, as whom\nknowest thou Vai _s_ vanara?'--'As Heaven only, O king,' he replied.--'Yea,'\nhe said, 'that indeed is Vai _s_ vanara Pre-eminence; and because thou knowest\nthe Vai _s_ vanara Pre-eminence, therefore thou art pre-eminent among thine\nequals; and, verily, he who knows that Vai _s_ vanara Preeminence\n\np. 397\n\nrepels death, and attains all life. But, indeed, this is only the head of Vai\n_s_ vanara, and thy head would have failed thee, hadst thou not come hither;\nor the head would have been unknown to thee, hadst thou not come hither.'\n\n10:6:1:1010\\. He said to them, 'Ye then, knowing different Vai _s_ vanaras,\nhave been feeding on different kinds of food; but verily, the well-beknown\ngods have attained, as it were, the measure of a span 1; but I will so tell\nthem unto you that I shall make them attain no more nor less than the measure\nof a span.'\n\n10:6:1:1111\\. Pointing at the head he said, 'This, indeed, is the Vai _s_\nvanara Pre-eminence;'--pointing at the eyes he said, 'This, indeed, is the Vai\n_s_ vanara of Soma's splendour;'--pointing at the nostrils he said, 'This,\nindeed, is the Vai _s_ vanara of divers courses;'--pointing at the space in\nthe mouth he said, 'This, indeed, is the Vai _s_ vanara Plenteous;'--pointing\nat the water in the mouth he said, 'This, indeed, is the Vai _s_ vanara\nWealth;'--pointing at the chin he said, 'This, indeed, is the Vai _s_ vanara\nFoundation.'\n\np. 398\n\n[paragraph continues] This Agni Vai _s_ vanara is no other than the Purusha;\nand, verily, whosoever thus knows that Agni Vai _s_ vanara as Purusha-like, as\nestablished within the Purusha, repels death, and attains all life; and,\nverily, Vai _s_ vanara does no harm to him that speaks of him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[393:1](sbe4371.htm#fr_809) _Kh_ andogyop. V, 11, where another version of\nthis story occurs, has here the name of Aru _n_ a's son, Uddalaka \xc3\x82ru _n_ i;\nand, instead of Maha _s_ ala _G_ abala, it has Pra _k_ ina _s_ ala Aupamanya.\n\n[393:2](sbe4371.htm#fr_810) Saya _n_ a takes this to mean, 'he (Aru _n_ a) was\nunable to instruct them in regard to Vai _s_ vanara,'--so\xe0\xa4\xbdru _n_ as tesha _m_\nsatyaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ adina _m_ pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ana _m_ vai _s_ vanaravidya _m_ bodhayitu\n_m_ na samiyaya sa _m_ gata _h_ _s_ akto nabhavat,--probably, however,\n'samiyaya' is better taken impersonally ('there was no agreement between\nthem'), as is done by the St. Petersb. Dict.; though _Kh_ and. XI, 3 favours\nSaya _n_ a's view.\n\n[393:3](sbe4371.htm#fr_811) Saya _n_ a takes 'samprati' in its ordinary sense\nof 'now.' The knowledge of Vai _s_ vanara implied here, according to Saya _n_\na, means the knowledge of the supreme deity (parame _s_ vara).\n\n[394:1](sbe4371.htm#fr_812) That is, in the way in which pupils approach their\nteacher.\n\n[394:2](sbe4371.htm#fr_813) Literally, 'Ye have entered (my tuition);' upeta\nstha upasina bhavatha. Say.\n\n[394:3](sbe4371.htm#fr_814) Or, perhaps, 'what Vai _s_ vanara knowest thou?'\n\n[394:4](sbe4371.htm#fr_815) 'Pratish _th_ a' (rest, foundation) also commonly\nmeans 'the feet.'\n\n[394:5](sbe4371.htm#fr_816) It is not quite clear whether the words 'or the\nfeet, &c.' really (as Saya _n_ a takes them) form part of the king's speech,\nor whether they are merely meant as explanatory of the latter part of the\nking's remarks. If Saya _n_ a be right, the words 'the feet would be unknown\nby thee,' seem to admit of a double meaning, viz. 'thou wouldst p. 395 have\nbecome footless,' or 'not even Vai _s_ vanara's feet would have been known by\nthee;' though in the latter sense some particle such as 'eva' might have been\nexpected. Saya _n_ a, however, seems to take these words in yet another sense\n(if, indeed, he had not another reading before him),--vai _s_ vanarasya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ anat padau te tava viparitagrahi _n_ o amlasyatam amlanau gamanasamarthav\nabhavishyata _m_ yadi ma _m_ nagamishya _h_ ; ittha _m_ doshaparyavasanayuktam\nekade _s_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ anam eva nava _s_ esha ity aha, padau to viditav iti vai\n_s_ vanarasya padamatra _m_ tvaya vidita _m_ na tu k _ri_ tsno vai _s_ vanara\n_h_ ; ata _h_ sadhv akarshir yat tvam agato\xe0\xa4\xbdsity abhipraya _h_.\n\n[396:1](sbe4371.htm#fr_817) Or, perhaps better, 'of Soma's fire.' The _Kh_\nandogya-upanishad has 'Sute _g_ as (of beautiful splendour, or light),'\ninstead of 'sutate _g_ as.'\n\n[396:2](sbe4371.htm#fr_818) According to Saya _n_ a, this refers to the\ncooking, or baking, of the cakes (puro _d_ a _s_ a) connected with the Soma-\nsacrifice.\n\n[397:1](sbe4371.htm#fr_819) Saya _n_ a apparently takes this thus: but the\ngods, knowing well that (essential element) which is merely of the space of a\nspan, have become successful;--yat tv eva _m_ yathoktavayavai _h_ p _ri_\nthivipadadibhir dyumurdhantair avayavair vi _s_ ish _t_ am eka _m_ vastu tat\nprade _s_ amatra _m_ prade _s_ aprama _n_ am iva deva _h_ suvidita _h_ samyag\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ atavanto\xe0\xa4\xbdbhisampanna _h_ praptaphala babhuvur ity artha _h_. Though\nthis interpretation looks very plausible, the accent of 'suvidita' would\nscarcely admit of the word being taken as a bahuvrihi compound. In the words\nwhich follow, Saya _n_ a takes 'them (enan)' to refer to the bodily parts of\nVai _s_ vanara, identified with the imperfect doctrines of the king's\ndisciples. It is, indeed, quite possible that 'the gods' are here identified\nwith the special Vai _s_ vanaras, the unity of whom, in the one Purusha, or\nAtman (self), the Brahma _n_ a endeavours to inculcate.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 6, 2.
