And here they ask: 'What is the beginning of this day?' Let him say: 'Mind\nand speech 2.'\n\n2\\. All desires dwell in the one (mind), the other yields all desires.\n\n3\\. All desires dwell in the mind, for with the mind he conceives all desires.\n\n4\\. All desires come to him who knows this.\n\n5\\. Speech yields all desires, for with speech he declares all his desires.\n\n6\\. Speech yields all desires to him who knows this.\n\n7\\. Here they say: 'Let him not begin this day with a _Ri_ _k_ , a Ya _g_ us,\nor a Saman verse (divine speech), for it is said, he should not start with a\n_Ri_ _k_ , a Ya _g_ us, or a Saman 3.'\n\n8\\. Therefore, let him say these Vyah _ri_ tis (sacred interjections) first.\n\n9\\. These interjections Bhus, Bhuvas, Svar are the three Vedas, Bhus the _Ri_\n_g_ -veda, Bhuvas the Ya _g_ ur-veda, Svar the Sama-veda. Therefore (by\n\np. 178\n\nintercalating these) he does not begin simply with a _Ri_ _k_ , Ya _g_ us, or\nSaman verse, he does not start with a _Ri_ _k_ , Ya _g_ us, or Saman verse.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[177:2](sbe01189.htm#fr_432) Mind, to think about the hymns which have to be\nrecited; speech, to recite them without a flaw.\n\n[177:3](sbe01189.htm#fr_433) It is doubtful whether neyad _ri_ ka _h_ and\napaga _k_ _kh_ et can have this meaning. However, what is intended is clear,\nviz. that the priest, even after having uttered the sound Him, should not\nimmediately begin with verses from the Vedas, but should intercalate the three\nsyllables bhur bhuva _h_ svar, or, if taken singly, bhus, bhuvas, svar.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 3](sbe01190.htm)\n\n"
