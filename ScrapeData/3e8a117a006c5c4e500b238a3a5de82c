(Brahman is that) from which the origin, &c. (i.e. the origin,\nsubsistence, and dissolution) of this (world proceed).\n\nThe term, &c. implies subsistence and re-absorption. That the origin is\nmentioned first (of the three) depends on the declaration of Scripture as well\nas on the natural development of a substance. Scripture declares the order\n\np. 16\n\nof succession of origin, subsistence, and dissolution in the passage, Taitt.\nUp. III, I, 'From whence these beings are born,' &c. And with regard to the\nsecond reason stated, it is known that a substrate of qualities can subsist\nand be dissolved only after it has entered, through origination, on the state\nof existence. The words 'of this' denote that substrate of qualities which is\npresented to us by perception and the other means of right knowledge; the\ngenitive case indicates it to be connected with origin, &c. The words 'from\nwhich' denote the cause. The full sense of the Sutra therefore is: That\nomniscient omnipotent cause from which proceed the origin, subsistence, and\ndissolution of this world--which world is differentiated by names and forms,\ncontains many agents and enjoyers, is the abode of the fruits of actions,\nthese fruits having their definite places, times, and causes 1, and the nature\nof whose arrangement cannot even be conceived by the mind,--that cause, we\nsay, is Brahman. Since the other forms of existence (such as increase,\ndecline, &c.) are included in origination, subsistence, and dissolution, only\nthe three latter are referred to in the Sutra. As the six stages of existence\nenumerated by Yaska 2 are possible only during the period of the world's\nsubsistence, it might--were they referred to in the Sutra--be suspected that\nwhat is meant are not the origin, subsistence, and dissolution (of the world)\nas dependent on the first cause. To preclude this suspicion the Sutra is to be\ntaken as referring, in addition to the world's origination from Brahman, only\nto its subsistence in Brahman, and final dissolution into Brahman.\n\nThe origin, &c. of a world possessing the attributes stated above cannot\npossibly proceed from anything else but a Lord possessing the stated\nqualities; not either from a non-intelligent pradhana 3, or from atoms, or\nfrom non-being,\n\np. 17\n\nor from a being subject to transmigration 1; nor, again, can it proceed from\nits own nature (i.e. spontaneously, without a cause), since we observe that\n(for the production of effects) special places, times, and causes have\ninvariably to be employed.\n\n(Some of) those who maintain a Lord to be the cause of the world 2, think that\nthe existence of a Lord different from mere transmigrating beings can be\ninferred by means of the argument stated just now (without recourse being had\nto Scripture at all).--But, it might be said, you yourself in the Sutra under\ndiscussion have merely brought forward the same argument!--By no means, we\nreply. The Sutras (i.e. literally 'the strings') have merely the purpose of\nstringing together the flowers of the Vedanta-passages. In reality the\nVedanta-passages referred to by the Sutras are discussed here. For the\ncomprehension of Brahman is effected by the ascertainment, consequent on\ndiscussion, of the sense of the Vedanta-texts, not either by inference or by\nthe other means of right knowledge. While, however, the Vedanta-passages\nprimarily declare the cause of the origin, &c., of the world, inference also,\nbeing an instrument of right knowledge in so far as it does not contradict the\nVedanta-texts, is not to be excluded as a means of confirming the meaning\nascertained. Scripture itself, moreover, allows argumentation; for the\npassages, B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 5 ('the Self is to be heard, to be considered'),\nand _Kh_. Up. VI, 14, 2 ('as the man, &c., having been informed, and being\nable to judge for himself, would arrive at Gandhara, in the same way a man who\nmeets with a teacher obtains knowledge'), declare that human understanding\nassists Scripture 3.\n\nScriptural text, &c. 4, are not, in the enquiry into Brahman,\n\np. 18\n\nthe only means of knowledge, as they are in the enquiry into active duty (i.e.\nin the Purva Mima _m_ sa), but scriptural texts on the one hand, and intuition\n1, &c., on the other hand, are to be had recourse to according to the\noccasion: firstly, because intuition is the final result of the enquiry into\nBrahman; secondly, because the object of the enquiry is an existing\n(accomplished) substance. If the object of the knowledge of Brahman were\nsomething to be accomplished, there would be no reference to intuition, and\ntext, &c., would be the only means of knowledge. The origination of something\nto be accomplished depends, moreover, on man since any action either of\nordinary life, or dependent on the Veda may either be done or not be done, or\nbe done in a different way. A man, for instance, may move on either by means\nof a horse, or by means of his feet, or by some other means, or not at all.\nAnd again (to quote examples of actions dependent on the Veda), we meet in\nScripture with sentences such as the following: 'At the atiratra he takes the\nsho _d_ asin cup,' and 'at the atiratra he does not take the sho _d_ asin\ncup;' or, 'he makes the oblation after the sun has risen,' and, 'he makes the\noblation when the sun has not yet risen.' Just as in the quoted instances,\ninjunctions and prohibitions, allowances of optional procedure, general rules\nand exceptions have their place, so they would have their place with regard to\nBrahman also (if the latter were a thing to be accomplished). But the fact is\nthat no option is possible as to whether a substance is to be thus or thus, is\nto be or not to be. All option depends on the notions of man; but the\nknowledge of the real nature of a thing does not depend on the notions of man,\nbut only on the thing itself. For to think with regard to a post, 'this is a\npost or a man, or something else,' is not knowledge of truth; the two ideas,\n'it is a man or something else,' being false, and only the third idea, 'it\n\np. 19\n\nis a post,' which depends on the thing itself, falling under the head of true\nknowledge. Thus true knowledge of all existing things depends on the things\nthemselves, and hence the knowledge of Brahman also depends altogether on the\nthing, i.e. Brahman itself.--But, it might be said, as Brahman is an existing\nsubstance, it will be the object of the other means of right knowledge also,\nand from this it follows that a discussion of the Vedanta-texts is\npurposeless.--This we deny; for as Brahman is not an object of the senses, it\nhas no connection with those other means of knowledge. For the senses have,\naccording to their nature, only external things for their objects, not\nBrahman. If Brahman were an object of the senses, we might perceive that the\nworld is connected with Brahman as its effect; but as the effect only (i.e.\nthe world) is perceived, it is impossible to decide (through perception)\nwhether it is connected with Brahman or something else. Therefore the Sutra\nunder discussion is not meant to propound inference (as the means of knowing\nBrahman), but rather to set forth a Vedanta-text.--Which, then, is the\nVedanta-text which the Sutra points at as having to be considered with\nreference to the characteristics of Brahman?--It is the passage Taitt. Up.\nIII, 1, 'Bh _ri_ gu Varu _n_ i went to his father Varu _n_ a, saying, Sir,\nteach me Brahman,' &c., up to 'That from whence these beings are born, that by\nwhich, when born, they live, that into which they enter at their death, try to\nknow that. That is Brahman.' The sentence finally determining the sense of\nthis passage is found III, 6: 'From bliss these beings are born; by bliss,\nwhen born, they, live; into bliss they enter at their death.' Other passages\nalso are to be adduced which declare the cause to be the almighty Being, whose\nessential nature is eternal purity, intelligence, and freedom.\n\nThat Brahman is omniscient we have been made to infer from it being shown that\nit is the cause of the world. To confirm this conclusion, the Sutrakara\ncontinues as follows:\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[16:1](sbe34008.htm#fr_65) So the compound is to be divided according to \xc3\x82n.\nGi. and Go.; the Bha. proposes another less plausible division.\n\n[16:2](sbe34008.htm#fr_66) According to Nirukta I, 2 the six bhavavikara _h_\nare: origination, existence, modification, increase, decrease, destruction.\n\n[16:3](sbe34008.htm#fr_67) The pradhana, called also prak _ri_ ti, is the\nprimal causal matter of the world in the _S_ a _n_ khya-system.
