The pair were the most prominent deities in Vedic times:\nabout 250 hymns are addressed to Indra and over 200 to Agni.\n\nIndra gave the "air of life" to men; Agni symbolized the "vital spark", the\nprinciple of life in animate and inanimate Nature; he was in man, in beast,\nand fish; he was in plants and trees; he was in butter and in intoxicating\nSoma. The gods partook of the nature of Agni. In one of the post-Vedic\nCreation myths he is identified with the Universal soul; Brahma existed in the\nform of Agni ere the worlds were framed and gods and men came to be. Agni was\nmade manifest in lightning, in celestial sun flames, in the sacred blaze\nrising from the altar and in homely household fires. The fire god was the\ndivine priest as contrasted with Indra, the divine warrior.\n\nIn the Vedic invocations there are evidences that\n\np. 20\n\nseveral myths had gathered round the fascinating and wonderful fire god. One\nhymn refers to him as a child whose birth was kept a secret; his mother, the\nqueen, concealed him from his sire; he was born in full vigour as a youth, and\nwas seen sharpening his weapons at a distance from his home which he had\nforsaken. 1 Sometimes he is said to have devoured his parents at birth: this\nseems to signify that he consumed the fire sticks from which holy fire was\nproduced by friction. Another hymn says that "Heaven and Earth (Dyaus and\nPrithivi) fled away in fear of (the incarnation of) Twashtri when he was born,\nbut they returned to embrace the lion". 2\n\nAgni was also given ten mothers who were "twice five sisters", 3 but the\nreference is clearly explained in another passage: "The ten fingers have given\nhim birth, the ancient, well-loved Agni, well born of his mothers". 4\n\nDawn, with its darkness-consuming fires, and starry Night, are the sisters of\nAgni; "they celebrate his three births, one in the sea, one in the sky, one in\nthe waters (clouds)". Typical of the Oriental mind is the mysterious reference\nto Agni\'s "mothers" owing their origin to him. The poet sings:\n\nWho among you hath understood the hidden (god)?  \n    The calf has by itself given birth to its mothers.\n\nProfessor Oldenberg, who suggests that the waters are the "mothers", reasons\nin Oriental mode: "Smoke is Agni, it goes to the clouds, the clouds become\nwaters". 5\n\nIn his early humanized form Agni bears some resemblance to Heimdal, the\nTeutonic sentinel god, who has\n\n\n\n[![AGNI, THE FIRE GOD<br> <i>From a painting by Nanda Lall Bose</i><br> \\(By\npermission of the Indian Society of Oriental Art, Calcutta\\)](tn/02000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/02000.jpg)  \nAGNI, THE FIRE GOD  \n_From a painting by Nanda Lall Bose_  \n(By permission of the Indian Society of Oriental Art, Calcutta)  \n\n\n\np. 21\n\nnine mothers, the daughters of sea-dwelling Ran, and is thus also a "son of\nthe waters"; he is clad in silvern armour, and on his head is a burnished\nhelmet with ram\'s horns. Horsed on his swift steed, Gulltop, he watches the\ndemons who seek to attack the citadel of the gods. . . . His sight is so keen\nthat he can see by night as well as by day. . . . Heimdal is loved both by\ngods and by men, and he is also called Gullintani because his teeth are of\ngold. There was a time when he went to Midgard (the earth) as a child; he grew\nup to be a teacher among men and was named Scef. Scef is identified as the\npatriarch Scyld in _Beowulf_ , who came over the sea as a child and rose to be\nthe king of a tribe. Mankind were descended from Heimdal-Scef: three sons were\nborn to him of human mothers--Thrall, from whom thralls are descended; Churl,\nthe sire of freemen, and Jarl from whom nobles have sprung. 1\n\nIn _Mahabharata_ there is a fragment of an old legend which relates the origin\nof Karna, the son of Queen Pritha and the sun god: the birth of the child is\nconcealed, and he is placed in a basket which is set afloat on the river and\nis carried to a distant country. 2\n\nOne of the Vedic references to Agni, as we have seen, suggests an origin\nsimilar to Karna of the epic period. He was connected with the introduction of\nagriculture like the Teutonic Scef, which signifies "Sheaf". Agni is stated to\nhave been "carried in the waters. . . . The great one has grown up in the wide\nunbounded space. The waters (have made) Agni (grow)". 3 Agni is "sharp faced"\n(i, 95); he is "the bright, brilliant, and shining one" (iv, I. 7); he is\n"gold toothed" (v, 22); he sees "even over the darkness of night" (i, 94. 7);\nhe "makes\n\np. 22\n\nall things visible"; he conquers the godless, wicked wiles; he sharpens his\ntwo horns in order to pierce Rakshasas (giants) (v, 2). "O Agni, strike away\nwith thy weapons those who curse us, the malicious ones, all ghouls, be they\nnear or far" (i, 94. 9). Heimdal blows a trumpet in battle; Agni is "roaring\nlike a bull" (i, 94. 10).\n\nAs Heimdal, in his Scef-child form, was sent to mankind by the gods,\n"Matarisvan 1 brought Agni to Bhrigu as a gift, precious like wealth, of\ndouble birth, the carrier, the famous, the beacon of the sacrifice, the ready,\nthe immediately successful messenger. . . . The Bhrigus worshipping him in the\nabode of the waters have verily established him among the clans of Ayu. The\npeople have established beloved Agni among the human clans as (people) going\nto settle (establish) Mitra" (i, 60). Oldenberg explains that people going\nanywhere secure safety by ceremonies addressed to Mitra, i.e. by concluding\nalliances under the protection of Mitra. Another reference reads, "Agni has\nbeen established among the tribes of men, the son of the waters, Mitra acting\nin the right way". Oldenberg notes that Mitra is here identified with Agni;\nMitra also means "friend" or "ally" (iii, 5. 3, and note). Scyld in _Beowulf_\n, the mysterious child of the sea, became a king over men. Agni "indeed is\nking, leading all beings to gloriousness. As soon as born from here, he looks\nover the whole world. . . . Agni, who has been looked and longed for in\nHeaven, who has been looked for on earth--he who has been looked for has\nentered all herbs" (i, 98). 2 To Agni\'s love affairs upon earth there are epic\nreferences, and in the "Vishnu Purana" he is mentioned as the father of three\nhuman sons.\n\np. 23\n\nThe reference to the Bhrigus, to whom Agni is carried, is of special interest.\nThis tribe did not possess fire and were searching for it ( _Rigveda_ , x. 40.\n2). In another poem the worshippers of Agni are "human people descended from\nManush (Manu)" (vi, 48. 8). The Bhrigus were a priestly family descended from\nthe patriarch Bhrigu: Manu was the first man. Two of the Teutonic patriarch\nnames are Berchter and Mannus.\n\nAgni was the messenger of the gods; he interceded with the gods on behalf of\nmankind and conducted the bright Celestials to the sacrifice. The priest\nchanted at the altar:\n\nAgni, the divine ministrant of the sacrifice, the greatest bestower of\ntreasures; may one obtain through Agni wealth and welfare day by day, which\nmay bring glory and high bliss of valiant offspring.\n\nAgni, whatever sacrifice and worship thou encompassest on every side, that\nindeed goes to the gods. Thou art King of all worship. . . . Conduct the gods\nhither in an easy-moving chariot. 1\n\nLike Indra, Agni was a heavy consumer of Soma; his intensely human side is not\nlost in mystic Vedic poetry.\n\nAgni, accept this log, conqueror of horses, thou who lovest songs and\ndelightest in riches . . .\n\nThou dost go wisely between these two creations (Heaven and Earth) like a\nfriendly messenger between two hamlets . . .\n\nHis worshippers might address him with great familiarity, as in the following\nextracts:\n\nIf I were thee and thou wert me, thine aspirations should be fulfilled.\n_Rigveda_ , xiii, 44. 23.\n\np. 24\n\nIf, O Agni, thou wert a mortal and I an immortal, I would not abandon thee to\nwrong or to penury: my worshippers should not be poor, nor distressed, nor\nmiserable.              _Rigveda_ , viii, 19.\n\nThese appeals are reminiscent of the quaint graveyard inscription:\n\nHere lie I, Martin Elginbrodde.  \nHae mercy on my soul, Lord God,  \nAs I wad dae were I Lord God,  \nAnd ye were Martin Elginbrodde.\n\nThe growth of monotheistic thought is usually evinced in all mythologies by\nthe tendency to invest a popular deity with the attributes of other gods. Agni\nis sometimes referred to as the sky god and the storm god. In one of the hymns\nhe is entreated to slay demons and send rain as if he were Indra:\n\nO Agni, overcome our enemies and our calamities;  \nDrive away all disease and the Rakshasas--  \nSend down abundance of waters  \nFrom the ocean of the sky.          _Rigveda_ , x, 98. 12.\n\nIndra similarly absorbed, and was absorbed by, the wind god Vayu or Vata, who\nis also referred to as the father of the Maruts and the son-in-law of the\nartisan god Twashtri. The name Vata has been compared to Vate, the father of\nthe Teutonic Volund or Wieland, the tribal deity of the Watlings or Vaetlings;\nin old English the Milky Way was "Watling Street". Comparisons have also been\ndrawn with the wind god Odin--the Anglo-Saxon Woden, and ancient German Wuotan\n(pronounced Vuotan). "The etymological connection in this view", writes a\ncritic, "is not free from difficulty." 1\n\np. 25\n\n[paragraph continues] Professor Macdonell favours the derivation from "va" =\n"to blow".\n\nThe Indian Vata is invoked, as Vayu, in a beautiful passage in one of the\nhymns which refers to his "two red horses yoked to the chariot": he had also,\nlike the Maruts, a team of deer. The poet calls to the wind:\n\nAwake Purandhu (Morning) as a lover awakes a sleeping maid. . . . Reveal\nheaven and earth. . . .  \nBrighten the dawn, yea, for glory, brighten the dawn. . . .\n\nThese lines recall Keats at his best:\n\nThere is no light  \nSave what from heaven is with the breezes blown . . .  \n                                        _Ode to the Nightingale_.\n\nA stirring hymn to the wind god loses much of its vigour and beauty in\ntranslation:\n\nSublime and shining is the car of Vata;  \nIt sweeps resounding, thundering and crashing;  \nAthwart the sky it wakens ruddy flashes,  \nOr o\'er the earth it sets the dust-clouds whirling.\n\nThe gusts arise and hasten unto Vata,  \nLike women going to a royal banquet;  \nIn that bright car the mighty god is with them,  \nFor he is rajah of the earth\'s dominions.\n\nWhen Vata enters on the paths of heaven,  \nAll day he races on; he never falters;  \nHe is the firstborn and the friend of Ocean--  \nWhence did he issue forth? Where is his birthplace?\n\nHe is the breath 1 of gods: all life is Vata:  \nHe cometh, yea, he goeth as he listeth:  \nHis voice is heard; his form is unbeholden--  \nO let us offer sacrifice to Vata.          _Rigveda_ , x, 168.\n\np. 26\n\nAnother wind or storm god is Rudra, also the father of the Maruts, who are\ncalled "Rudras". He is the "Howler" and "the Ruddy One", and rides a wild\nboar. Saussaye calls him "the Wild Huntsman of Hindu Mythology". He is chiefly\nof historical interest because he developed into the prominent post-Vedic god\nShiva, the "Destroyer", who is still worshipped in India. The poets invested\nhim with good as well as evil qualities:\n\nRudra, thou smiter of workers of evil,  \nThe doers of good all love and adore thee.  \nPreserve me from injury and every affliction--  \nRudra, the nourisher.\n\nGive unto me of thy medicines, Rudra,  \nSo that my years may reach to a hundred;  \nDrive away hatred, shatter oppression,  \nWard off calamity.                       _Rigveda_ , ii, 33.\n\nThe rain cloud was personified in Parjanya, who links with Indra as the\nnourisher of earth, and with Agni as the quickener of seeds.\n\nIndra\'s great rival, however, was Varuna, who symbolized the investing sky: he\nwas "the all-enveloping one". The hymns impart to him a character of Hebraic\ngrandeur. He was the sustainer of the universe, the law-giver, the god of\nmoral rectitude, and the sublime sovereign of gods and men. Men worshipped him\nwith devoutness, admiration, and fear. "It is he who makes the sun to shine in\nheaven; the winds that blow are but his breath; he has hollowed out the\nchannels of the rivers which flow at his command, and he has made the depths\nof the sea. His ordinances are fixed and unassailable; through their operation\nthe moon walks in brightness, and the stars which appear in the nightly sky,\n\n\n\n[![SHIVA\'S DANCE OF DESTRUCTION, ELLORA](tn/02600.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/02600.jpg)  \nSHIVA\'S DANCE OF DESTRUCTION, ELLORA  \n\n(see pages [147](iml13.htm#page_147)-8)\n\n\n\np. 27\n\nvanish in daylight. The birds flying in the air, the rivers in their sleepless\nflow, cannot attain a knowledge of his flower and wrath. But he knows the\nflight of the birds in the sky, the course of the far-travelling wind, the\npaths of ships on the ocean, and beholds all secret things that have been or\nshall be done. He witnesses men\'s truth and falsehood." 1\n\nHe is the Omniscient One. Man prayed to him for forgiveness for sin, and to be\nspared from the consequences of evil-doing:\n\nMay I not yet, King Varuna,  \nGo down into the house of clay:  \nHave mercy, spare me, mighty Lord.\n\nO Varuna, whatever the offence may be  \nThat we as men commit against the heavenly folk,  \nWhen through our want of thought we violate thy laws,  \nChastise us not, O god, for that iniquity.  \n                                           _Rigveda_ , vii, 89. 2\n\n                   His messengers descend  \nCountless from his abode--for ever traversing  \nThis world and scanning with a thousand eyes its inmates.  \nWhate\'er exists within this earth, and all within the sky,  \nYea, all that is beyond, King Varuna perceives. . . .  \nMay thy destroying snares, cast sevenfold round the wicked,  \nEntangle liars, but the truthful spare, O King!  \n                                             _Rigveda_ , iv, 16. 3\n\nIn contrast to the devotional spirit pervading the Varuna hymns is the\nattitude adopted by Indra\'s worshippers; the following prayer to the god of\nbattle is characteristic:--\n\nO Indra, grant the highest, best of treasures,  \nA judging mind, prosperity abiding, p. 28  \nRiches abundant, lasting health of body,  \nThe grace of eloquence and days propitious.  \n                                       _Rigveda_ , ii, 21. 6.\n\nThe sinner\'s fear of Varuna prompted him to seek the aid of other gods. Rudra\nand the Moon are addressed:\n\nO remove ye the sins we have sinned,  \nWhat evil may cling to us sever  \nWith bolts and sharp weapons, kind friends,  \nAnd gracious be ever.  \nFrom the snare of Varuna deliver us, ward us,  \nYe warm-hearted gods, O help us and guard us.\n\nAssociated with Varuna was the God Mitra (the Persian Mithra). These deities\nare invariably coupled and belong to the early Iranian period. Much\ncontroversy has been waged over their pre-Vedic significance. Some have\nregarded Mithra as the firmament by day with its blazing and fertilizing sun,\nand Varuna as the many-eyed firmament of night, in short, the twin forms of\nDyaus. Prof. E. V. Arnold has shown, however, that in the Vedas, Mithra has no\nsolar significance except in his association with Agni. The fire god, as we\nhave seen, symbolized the principle of fertility in Nature: he was the "vital\nspark" which caused the growth of "all herbs", as well as the illuminating and\nwarmth-giving flames of sun and household hearth.\n\nMitra as Mithra with Varuna, and a third vague god, Aryaman, belong to an\nearly group of equal deities called the Adityas, or "Celestial deities". "It\nwould seem that the worship of these deities", says Prof. Arnold, "was already\ndecaying in the earliest Vedic period, and that many of them were then falling\ninto oblivion. . . . In a late Vedic hymn we find that Indra boasts that he\nhas dethroned Varuna, and invites Agni to enter his own\n\np. 29\n\nservice instead. We may justly infer from all these circumstances that the\nworship of the \'celestials\' occupied at one time in the history of the race a\nposition of greater importance than its place in the _Rigveda_ directly\nsuggests." 1\n\nThe following extracts from a Mitra-Varuna hymn indicate the attitude of the\nearly priests towards the "Celestial deities":--\n\nTo the gods Mitra and Varuna let our praise go forth with power, with all\nreverence, to the two of mighty race.\n\nThese did the gods establish in royal power over themselves, because they were\nwise and the children of wisdom, and because they excelled in power.\n\nThey are protectors of hearth and home, of life and strength; Mitra and\nVaruna, prosper the mediations of your worshippers. . . .\n\nAs the sun rises to-day do I salute Mitra and Varuna, and glorious Aryaman. .\n. . The blessings of heaven are our desire. . . .                 _Prof\nArnold\'s translation_.\n\nIn Babylonian mythology the sun is the offspring of the moon. The Semitic name\nof the sun god is Samas (Shamash), the Sumerian name is Utu; among other non-\nSemitic names was Mitra, "apparently the Persian Mithra". The bright deity\nalso "bears the names of his attendants \'Truth\' and \'Righteousness\', who\nguided him upon his path as judge of the earth". 2\n\nIt may be that the Indian Mitra was originally a sun god; the religion of the\nsun god Mithra spread into Europe. "Dedications to Mithra the Unconquered Sun\nhave been found in abundance." 3 Vedic references suggest that Mitra had\nbecome a complex god in the pre-Vedic\n\np. 30\n\n[paragraph continues] Age, being probably associated with a group of abstract\ndeities--his attributes symbolized--who are represented by the Adityas. The\nMitra-Varuna group of Celestials were the source of all heavenly gifts; they\nregulated sun and moon, the winds and waters and the seasons. If we assume\nthat they were of Babylonian or Sumerian origin--deities imported by a branch\nof Aryan settlers who had been in contact with Babylonian civilization--their\nrivalry with the older Aryan gods, Indra and Agni, can be understood.\nUltimately they were superseded, but the influence exercised by their cult\nremained and left its impress upon later Aryan religious thought.\n\nThe Assyrian word "metru" signifies rain. 1 The quickening rain which caused\nthe growth of vegetation was, of course, one of the gifts of the Celestials of\nthe firmament. It is of interest to note, therefore, in this connection that\nProfessor Frazer includes the western Mithra among the "corn gods". Dealing\nwith Mithraic sculptures, which apparently depict Mithra as the sacrificer of\nthe harvest bull offering, he says: "On certain of these monuments the tail of\nthe bull ends in three stalks of corn, and in one of them cornstalks instead\nof blood are seen issuing from the wound inflicted by the knife". 2\n\nCommenting on the Assyrian "metru" Professor Moulton says: "If this is his\n(Mithra\'s) origin, we get a reasonable basis for the Avestan (Early Persian\nand Aryan) use of the word to denote a \'contract\', as also for the fact that\nthe deity is in the Avesta patron of Truth and in the Veda of Friendship. He\nis \'the Mediator between Heaven and Earth, as the firmament was by\n\np. 31\n\nits position, both in nature and mythology: an easy corollary is his function\nof regulating the relations of man and man."\n\nThe character of an imported deity is always influenced by localization and\ntribal habits. Pastoral nomads would therefore have emphasized the\nfriendliness of Mithra, who sent rain to cause the growth of grass on sun-\nparched steppes. Both Mithra and Varuna had their dwelling-place in the sea of\nheaven, the waters "above the firmament" from which the rain descended.\nUltimately the Indian Mitra vanished, being completely merged in Varuna, who\nbecame the god of ocean after the Aryans reached the sea coast. In post-Vedic\nsacred literature the priestly theorists, in the process of systematizing\ntheir religious beliefs, taught that a great conflict took place between the\ngods and demons. When order was restored, the various deities were\nredistributed. Indra remained the atmospheric god of battle, and Varuna became\nthe god of ocean, where, as the stern judge and lawgiver and the punisher of\nwrongdoers, he kept watch over the demons. In the "Nala and Damayanti" epic\nnarrative, the four "world guardians" are: Indra, king of the gods; Agni, god\nof fire; Varuna, god of waters; and Yama, judge of the dead.\n\nIt may be that the displacement of Varuna as supreme deity was due to the\ninfluence of the fire-worshipping cult of Agni, who was imported by certain\nunidentified Aryan tribes that entered India. Agni did not receive\nrecognition, apparently, from the other Aryan "folk-wave", which established a\nmilitary aristocracy at Mitanni in Mesopotamia, and held sway for a period\nover the Assyrians and some of the Hittite tribes. An important inscription,\nwhich is dated about 1400 B.C., has been deciphered at Boghaz-Koi in Asia\nMinor by Professor\n\np. 32\n\n[paragraph continues] Hugo Winckler, who gives the names of the following\ndeities:\n\n"Mi-it-ra, Uru-w-na, In-da-ra, and Na-sa-at-ti-ia"--\n\n[paragraph continues] Mitra, Varuna, Indra, Nasatya. The latter is Nasatyau,\nthe Vedic Aswins, twin gods of morning, who have been compared to the Greek\nDioskouri (Castor and Pollux), sons of Zeus.\n\nA Vedic triad, which suggests a rival cult to that of the worshippers of\nVaruna and other Adityas, is formed by Vayu (wind), Agni (fire), and Surya\n(the sun).\n\nThe Indian sun god Surya, like the Egyptian Ra, had three forms. The rising\nsun was Vivasvat; the setting sun was Savitri.\n\nVivasvat was the son-in-law of Twashtri, the artisan of Nature; he was an\nabstract deity, and apparently owed his origin to the group of Adityas.\n\nSavitri, who had yellow hair, was of pre-Vedic origin. He was the\n"Stimulator". When he commanded Night to approach, men ceased their labours,\nbirds sought their nests, and cattle their sheds. 1\n\nDuring the long centuries covered by the Vedic period many "schools of\nthought" must have struggled for supremacy. The Vivasvat myth belongs, it\nwould appear, to the time before the elephant was tamed by the Aryans. Aditi,\nthe mother of the Adityas, who is believed to be of later origin than her\nchildren, had eight sons. She cherished seven of them; the eighth, which was a\nshapeless lump, was thrown away, but was afterwards moulded into Vivasvat, the\nsun; the pieces of the lump which were cast away by the divine artisan fell\nupon the earth and gave origin to the elephant, therefore elephants should not\nbe caught, because they partake of divine nature.\n\n\n\n[![SURYA IN HIS CHARIOT<br> <i>From the Kailasa Temple,\nEllora</i>.](tn/03200.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/03200.jpg)  \nSURYA IN HIS CHARIOT  \n_From the Kailasa Temple, Ellora_.  \n\n\n\np. 33\n\nSurya is an Aryanized sun god. He drives a golden chariot drawn by seven\nmares, or a mare with seven heads; he has golden hair and golden arms and\nhands. As he is alluded to as "the eye of Varuna and Mitra", and a son of\nAditi, it is evident that if he did not originally belong to the group of\nAdityas, he was strongly influenced by them. In his Savitri character, which\nhe possesses at morning as well as at evening, he stimulates all life and the\nmind of man. One of the most sacred and oldest mantras (texts) in the Vedas is\nstill addressed by Brahmans to the rising sun. It runs:--\n\nLet us meditate on that excellent glory of the divine Vivifier,  \nMay he enlighten (or stimulate) our understandings. 1\n\nThe feeling for Nature pervades the ancient religion and literature of India.\nPriests were poets and singers in early Vedic times. A Rishi was a composer of\nhymns to the gods, and several are named in the collections. Every great\nfamily appears to have had its bardic priest, and its special poetic anthology\nwhich was handed down from generation to generation. Old poems might be\nrewritten and added to, but the ambition of the sacred poet was to sing a new\nsong to the gods. The oldest Vedic hymns are referred to as "new songs", which\nsuggests that others were already in existence.\n\nThese Rishis looked upon Nature with the poet\'s eye. They symbolized\neverything, but they revelled also in the gorgeous beauty of dawn and evening,\nthe luxuriance of Indian trees and flowers, the serene majesty of Himalayan\nmountains, the cascades, the rivers, and the shining lakes. The wonder and\nmystery of the world Inspired their hymns and their religion. Even the gods\ntook delight in the songs of birds, the harping of forest\n\np. 34\n\nwinds, the humming of bees, the blossoming trees, and the flower-decked sward.\nHeaven has its eternal summer and soft scented winds, its lotus-gemmed lakes\nand never-fading blooms.\n\nThe effulgence and silence of dawn inspired some of the most beautiful Vedic\nhymns. Dawn is Ushas, the daughter of Dyaus; she is the Indian Aurora:\n\nHail, ruddy Ushas, golden goddess, borne  \nUpon thy shining car, thou comest like  \nA lovely maiden by her mother decked,  \nDisclosing coyly all thy hidden graces  \nTo our admiring eyes; or like a wife  \nUnveiling to her lord, with conscious pride,  \nBeauties which, as he gazes lovingly,  \nSeem fresher, fairer, each succeeding morn.  \nThrough years and years thou hast lived on, and yet  \nThou \'rt ever young. Thou art the breath of life  \nOf all that breathes and lives, awaking day by day  \nMyriads of prostrate sleepers, as from death,  \nCausing the birds to flutter from their nests,  \nAnd rousing men to ply with busy feet  \nTheir daily duties and appointed tasks,  \nToiling for wealth, or pleasure, or renown. 1\n\nThe Vedic poets "looked before and after". One sang:\n\nIn ages past did mortals gaze  \n  On Ushas veiled in gleaming gold.  \nWe who are living watch her rays,  \n  And men unborn will her behold.  \n                               _Rigveda_ , i, 113. 11.\n\nNight, Ratri, is the sister of Dawn. The one robes herself in crimson and\ngold; the other adorns her dark raiment with gleaming stars. When benevolent\nRatri draws nigh, men turn towards their homes to rest, birds\n\np. 35\n\nseek their nests, cattle lie down; even the hawk reposes. The people pray to\nthe goddess to be protected against robbers and fierce wolves, and to be taken\nsafely across her shadow:\n\nShe, the immortal goddess, throws her veil  \nOver low valley, rising ground, and hill.  \nBut soon with bright effulgence dissipates  \nThe darkness she produces; soon advancing  \nShe calls her sister Morning to return,  \nAnd then each darksome shadow melts away.  \n                                         _Rigveda_ , x. 1\n\nThe moon is the god Chandra, who became identified with Soma. Among ancient\npeoples the moon was regarded as the source of fertility and growth; it\nbrought dew to nourish crops which ripened under the "harvest moon"; it filled\nall vegetation with sap; it swayed human life from birth till death; it\ninfluenced animate and inanimate Nature in its periods of increase and\ndecline; ceremonies to secure offspring were performed during certain phases\nof the moon.\n\nSoma was the intoxicating juice of the now unknown Soma plant, which inspired\nmortals and was the nectar of the gods. The whole ninth book of the _Rigveda_\nis devoted to the praises of Soma, who is exalted even as the chief god, the\nFather of all.\n\nThis Soma is a god; he cures  \nThe sharpest ills that man endures.  \nHe heals the sick, the sad he cheers,  \nHe nerves the weak, dispels their fears;  \nThe faint with martial ardour fires,  \nWith lofty thought the bard inspires,  \nThe soul from earth to heaven he lifts,  \nSo great and wondrous are his gifts; p. 36  \nMen feel the god within their veins,  \nAnd cry in loud exulting strains:  \n  We\'ve quaffed the Soma bright  \n    And are immortal grown:  \n  We\'ve entered into light  \n    And all the gods have known.  \n  What mortal now can harm,  \n    Or foeman vex us more?  \n  Through thee beyond alarm,  \n    Immortal god, we soar. 1\n\n"The sun", declared one of the poets, "has the nature of Agni, the moon of\nSoma." At the same time Agni was a great consumer of Soma; when it was poured\non the altar, the fire god leapt up joyfully. The beverage was the "water of\nlife" which was believed to sustain the Adityas and the earth, and to give\nimmortality to all the gods; it was therefore called Amrita (ambrosia).\n\nAs in Teutonic mythology, the Hindu giants desired greatly to possess the\n"mead" to which the gods owed their power and supremacy. The association of\nSoma with the moon recalls the Germanic belief that the magic mead was kept\nfor Odin, "the champion drinker", by Mani, the moon god, who snatched it from\nthe mythical children who are the prototypes of "Jack and Jill" of the nursery\nrhyme. 2 Indra was the discoverer of the Soma plant and brought it from the\nmountains. The Persian mead (mada) was called Haoma.\n\nThe priests drank Soma when they made offerings and lauded the gods. A semi-\nhumorous Rigvedic hymn compares them to the frogs which croak together when\nthe rain comes after long drought.\n\nEach (frog) with merry croak and loudly calling  \nSalutes the other, as a son his father; p. 37  \nWhat one calls out, another quickly answers,  \nLike boys at school their teacher\'s words repeating. . . .  \nThey shout aloud like Brahmans drunk with Soma,  \nWhen they perform their annual devotions.  \n                                            _Rigveda_ , vii, 103. 1\n\nThere are references in the _Rigveda_ to the marriage of Soma, the moon, and\nSurya, the maiden of the sun.\n\nIn Vedic religion many primitive beliefs were blended. We have seen, for\ninstance, that life was identified with breath and wind; the "spirit" left the\nbody as the last breath. Agni worshippers regarded fire as "the vital spark".\nSoma worship, on the other hand, appears to be connected with the belief that\nlife was in the blood; it was literally "the life blood". The "blood of trees"\nwas the name for sap; sap was water impregnated or vitalized by Soma, the\nessence of life. Water worship and Soma worship were probably identical, the\nmoon, which was believed to be the source of growth and moisture, being the\nfountain head of "the water of life". In Teutonic mythology the "mead" is\ntaken from a hidden mountain spring, which issued from "Mimer\'s well" in the\nUnderworld. Odin drank from Mimer\'s well and obtained wisdom and long life.\nThe "mead" was transported to the moon. The "mead" was also identified with\nsaliva, the moisture of life, and spitting ceremonies resulted; these survive\nin the custom still practised in our rural districts of spitting on the hand\nto seal a bargain; "spitting stones" have not yet entirely disappeared. Vows\nare still taken in India before a fire. References to contracts signed in\nblood are common and widespread.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[20:1](iml07.htm#fr_66) _Rigveda_ , v, 2.\n\n[20:2](iml07.htm#fr_67) _Rigveda_ , i, 95.\n\n[20:3](iml07.htm#fr_68) _Rigveda_ , iv, 6. 8.\n\n[20:4](iml07.htm#fr_69) _Rigveda_ , 23. 3.\n\n[20:5](iml07.htm#fr_70) _Rigveda_ , i, 95. 4, and note, Oldenberg\'s _Vedic\nHymns_ ( _Sacred Books of the East_ , vol. xlvi).\n\n[21:1](iml07.htm#fr_71) _Teutonic Myth and Legend_ , pp. 16 and 187-9.\n\n[21:2](iml07.htm#fr_72) See [Chapter X](iml15.htm#ch10).\n\n[21:3](iml07.htm#fr_73) Oldenberg, _Rigveda_ , iii, 1.\n\n[22:1](iml07.htm#fr_74) A demi-god.\n\n[22:2](iml07.htm#fr_75) _Vedic Hymns_ , trans. by Oldenberg.
