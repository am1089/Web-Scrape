This end is believed to be reached by replacing egoism with\nunlimited universalism, the individual learning to desire his own good by\ndesiring the good of others. But such an unlimited universalism could hardly\nbe practiced within the limited sphere of the duties and activities of a\nhouseholder. The ideal yogin who renounced the world and spent a life of\nsupreme self-control and suppression of all desires, and who practiced his\nyoga courses in which all movements of his body are inhibited, could not live\nin society and follow the ordinary vocations of life. Cut off from society, he\npursued a goal of individualistic perfection. 1\n\nBut the general Hindu system of life was not monistic, individualistic, or\nseparatistic. Hindu society was divided into four castes. We find (1)\nBrahmins, who followed the scholarly and the priestly line of work, studied\nthe Vedas, gave spiritual instruction and performed the sacrifices; (2)\nKshatriyas, the warrior\n\np. 114\n\ncaste who protected the weak from the attacks of the strong, governed kingdoms\nas kings, and gave to the Brahmins all protection and encouragement in their\nscholarly and priestly works; (3) Vaishyas, or the trading and pastoral caste,\nwho increased the wealth of the country by trading and farming; and (4)\nShudras, or the servant caste, recruited from the non-Aryans who found a home\nin the Aryan societies and served as menials to the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and\nVaishyas.\n\nThe Brahmin went to live with his teacher from the age of eight and remained\nwith him until he had completed the study of the Vedas. He then returned from\nthe house of his teacher and was bound according to the injunction of the\nscriptures to get married, to perform regularly the sacrifices, to be united\nwith his wife and procreate sons, to teach students, and to make gifts or\ncharities to proper persons at auspicious times and at holy places. Upon\nreaching the age of fifty he had to retire to forest life with his wife, and\ngive himself up to holy thoughts and the leading of a holy life. In the last\nstage of his life, it was necessary for him to renounce even his forest life\nof retirement. He had to sever himself from all his attachments, lead the life\nof a hermit and get his food by begging. Of these four stages of life, called\nBrahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, and Yati, the householder\'s life was\nregarded as the best. For this stage ( _ashrama_ ) provided an\n[opportunity](errata.htm#1) for the doing of good to the people of all the\nother stages of life, by gifts, by the performance of sacrifices, by\ninstruction to teachers,\n\np. 115\n\nand by the procreation of good sons who might become the future supporters of\nsociety. Performance of sacrifices, teaching, and the procreation of sons were\nregarded as debts with which every Brahmin was born, and no Brahmin had any\nright to seek the individualistic goal of a hermit\'s life unless and until he\nhad discharged these duties for the major portion of his life. 2\n\nSimilarly, it was regarded as the duty of a Kshatriya to protect the weak and\nto fight in a good cause, and of a Vaisya to carry on trading and farming. The\nperformance of the class of duties belonging to each caste at its specific\nstage of life is the imperative duty ( _dharma_ ); transgression of it was\nheld to be transgression of duty and hence vicious ( _adharma_ ). What was\nexpected of every man was that he follow the specific duties allotted to his\ncaste, satisfy his desires of life, and enjoy the pleasures of life. It was a\nbalance in which equal attention was paid to the performance of the allotted\nduties and to the satisfaction of personal needs and desires that was regarded\nas the true ideal of life for all normal persons. Only in exceptional cases\ndid the Hindu scheme of life admit the renouncement of this life ( _trivarga_\n) of threefold duties in a search for the attainment of the goal of liberation\n( _apavarga_ ). The yearning after a higher life was an actual and soul-\nstirring experience among spiritually-minded persons. They were allowed the\nprivilege of renouncing the life of ordinary pleasures, and of seeking to kill\nall other desires and to attain true knowledge, by intuition, moral elevation,\nyoga\n\np. 116\n\nor even by asceticism. In their case alone, however, was this exception made.\nBut even then the exception was not very readily admitted in orthodox Hindu\ncircles. We remember the great effort that Shankara, the great Vedanta\nteacher, had to make, especially in his commentary on the Gita, to establish\nthis point. He taught that those who attained higher knowledge ( _jnana_ )\nwere exempt from the allotted duties of ordinary persons. These duties were\nobligatory only for those who did not attain the higher knowledge. But\nShankara\'s interpretation of the Gita was objected to by other authorities. 3\n\nThe Gita is a work of great sanctity and popularity among the Hindus. It\nconsists of seven hundred simple verses, of which the first chapter of forty-\nsix verses forms the introduction. It is written in the form of a dialogue\nbetween Lord Krishna and Arjuna, the great warrior who, on the battlefield of\nthe terrible Indian civil war described in the classic heroic poem\nMahabharata, is appalled at the prospect of the fearful impending destruction\nand refuses to fight. Lord Krishna tries to persuade him, in the Gita, that as\na Kshatriya, (a man of the military caste) it is his duty to fight. To add\nstrength to his persuasion he makes use of many moral and religious arguments.\nTraditionally this theme forms a part of the fifth canto of the Mahabharata.\nThough its date is uncertain, it may well be believed to have been written\nabout the . second or the third century B. C. It discards self-mortification\nand believes in three kinds of _tapas_ : first, bodily discipline--respect to\ngods, Brahmins and the\n\np. 117\n\nwise, purity, sincerity, chastity and non-injury; second, speech discipline--\nsweet and truthful speech, and study; and third, mental discipline--\ncontentment, self-control, amiability, purity of mind, and meditation.\n\nBut the great solution of the Gita is the compromise it advances between the\nworldly life of allotted duties and the hermit life of absolute renouncement,\nand between a life of lawful and proper enjoyment and the absolute extinction\nof desires. The program that it proposes is, on the one hand, that we purify\nour minds, purging them of all attachments and passions by dedicating all the\nfruits of our actions to God; and yet, on the other hand, that we continue to\nperform all the duties belonging to our particular caste or stage of life. It\nis not the actions but our own inclinations and passions that really bind us.\nBut if we can augment our faith in and our affection for God to such an extent\nthat in our love for Him we free ourselves from all other attachments while\nyet we continue to perform the allotted and normal duties, the actions can in\nno wise bind us to a lower goal. A life dedicated to God, and lived for and in\nlove of Him, is a life which is inevitably ennobled to the highest degree. A\nseer who has been able to liberate himself from the tendency to self-seeking\nand from attachment is never over-pleased at any good fortune nor over-sorry\nat any misfortune. His is a calm and unruffled life. He takes the pleasures\nand sorrows of life without the least perturbation; he has no fear and no\nanger; he is firm in himself, unshakeable and unmoved.\n\np. 118\n\n[paragraph continues] Yet he follows the daily routine of social and other\nduties.\n\nThe Gita seems to reject the doctrine that the body and mind may be made\nentirely motionless or inactive. Simple physical conditions could make the\nbody move; and it urges that it is only a false show of morality when the body\nis controlled and yet one continues to think of doing bad things or to harbor\nthoughts of attachment. The mysticism of the Gita consists in the belief that\nthe performance of actions without personal attachment or self-seeking motive,\nand with a dedication of their fruits to God, leads a man to his highest\nrealization or liberation. Knowledge is praised, but only because true\nknowledge is conducive to the acceptance of such a life of desireless self-\nsurrender to God. A man who has no personal motive in an action really does\nnot perform the action though to all appearances he may seem to be so doing.\nIt is only such a person who my truly be called a yogin. His is a mind that is\nconstantly fixed on God, and he performs all his duties for the sake of duty,\nout of reverence to the law, and with complete self-surrender to God. 4\n\nSelf-surrender to God, or self-abnegation, however, does not in the Gita\ninvolve a personal relationship of communion and love so much as it does the\nmoral qualities of compassion, universal friendship, humility, contentment,\nwant of attachment, self-control and purity. The expectation is emphasized\nthat a person possessed of these moral qualities will be equally unruffled in\nsorrow and in happiness and that he will be the friend of all. Mind and\nintellect are to be concentrated\n\np. 119\n\non God, and all actions are to be surrendered to Him. This does not\nnecessarily mean a superabundance of love. It may be an offshoot of the old\nyoga ideal of Patanjali. Here it is enjoined that the mind and intellect be\nconcentrated on God, for, if this is done, God, being satisfied by this\nattachment, will help the yogin, and by His divine grace the yogin may achieve\nhis goal much more easily than would otherwise be possible. The idea of the\nsurrender of all actions to God is also to be found in the yoga of Patanjali.\nThough the writer of the Gita admits breath-control as a discipline, yet his\nwhole emphasis is laid on self-abnegation and self-surrender to God. Breath-\ncontrol seems to be given only a subordinate value, that of a means of\npurifying the mind. We have, therefore, in the Gita a new solution of how a\nman may attain his highest liberation. He may remain a member of society and\nperform his allotted duties provided he has the right sort of moral elevation,\nhas fixed his mind on God, has dissociated himself from all attachment, and,\nby self-surrender and self-abnegation, has devoted himself to God. It is faith\nin the special grace of God to those who have surrendered themselves to Him\nthat forms the essence of the Gita 5\n\nThough the idea of love for God does not show itself in any prominent way in\nearly Sanskrit literature, except in the Pancaratra literature, it is very\nimprobable that the idea was not known from very early times. For some of the\nmonotheistic Vedic hymns reveal an intimate personal relation with the deity,\nimplying affection;\n\np. 120\n\nand in the Buddhist literature we find frequent references to love for the\nBuddha.\n\nIn the Vishnu Purana we are given the story of Prahlada. Because of his\ndevotion to Hari, his father tormented him in various ways and sought to put\nhim to death by throwing him into fire or into the sea, by administering\npoison, and by various other methods. But he was saved from all these perils\nby the grace of Hari, and as a true devotee of the great Lord he was not in\nthe least angry with his father. In all the adoration to Hari, whether on the\npart of Prahlada or as otherwise reported in the Vishnu Purana and in many of\nthe other early Puranas, the great Lord is adored and praised metaphysically\nor philosophically as the great Being from whom everything has come forth and\nto whom everything will return, as the great controller of the universe and\nthe great lord who is residing within us and is controlling us, and as the\nprime mover of the material cosmic world which is only a manifestation of his\npower. The subtle and primal cosmic matter is a concrete expression of the\nenergy of the Lord. By His will it is set in active operation and transforms\nitself into the visible universe. The universe, therefore, though in a sense\ndifferent from Him, is ultimately sustained and supported by Him; created by\nHim, it will ultimately return to Him. Many are the hymns in the Puranas which\npraise God in this philosophical manner and extol His great powers. There are\nalso numberless instances in which God is said to be pleased by philosophic\nmeditation,\n\np. 121\n\nand in consequence appears to the devotee, to speak with him, and to grant him\nthe boon he seeks. 6\n\nThe earlier literature does not always emphasize the feeling element in\ndevotion. In the Vishnu Purana, however, we find that when God came face to\nface with Prahlada and asked him if he had a boon to crave, he besought the\nsame attachment for the Lord that ordinary people have for sense enjoyments.\nThe devotion that Prahlada had previously shown was a concentration on God and\na serene contemplation in which he became one, as it were, with the Lord.\nRamanuja, the great Vedanta commentator of the 11th century, also defines\ndevotion (bhakti) as a contemplation of God unbroken as the smooth and\nceaseless flow of oil. But that such a contemplation necessarily implies love\nof God as its inner motive cannot be denied, and Ramanuja also describes this\nceaseless contemplation as having its main source in love for God, who was so\ndear to the devotee. But all that I wish to point out in this connection is\nthat, in this aspect of devotion, contemplation and communion are more\nprominent than any exuberance of feeling. Prahlada was attached to God by his\nlove of Him; God was the dearest of all dear things to him. It was this inmost\nand most deep-seated love for God that stirred him to withdraw his mind from\nall other things and to enter into such a contemplation of God that he became\nabsorbed in Him, his whole personality lost in an ecstatic trance unity with\nGod. But this did not satisfy Prahlada. He desired such a devotion to God that\nthe very thought of Him would bring the same sort of satisfaction\n\np. 122\n\nthat persons ordinarily have in thinking of sense-objects. He desired not only\ncontemplative union but longed also to taste God\'s love as one tastes the\npleasures of the senses. 7\n\nIt is the contemplative union with God that we find in the Gita, and the\ntransition to it from the state of yoga concentration is not difficult to\nunderstand. Self-surrender to God, the higher moral elevation, and\nconcentration on God are all present in Patanjali\'s yoga. But here the\nobjective was the destruction of the mind through psychical exercises\naccompanied by the complete inhibition of bodily and mental activity. Later\nthe devotee seeks to attain liberation through the special grace of the Lord,\nwhich he can hope to acquire by such contemplative union.\n\nIn later Indian thought the method of yoga on the one hand receded in favor of\nthat of bhakti or devotion; on the other hand, its pure form became greatly\ncomplicated by the development of many mysterious doctrines and rites which\nbecame associated with it, sought its support, and claimed to be forms of it.\nBut my time is limited and I cannot enter into these latter forms of\nmysticism. Nor can I describe those mystical religious movements which,\narising as a reaction against the dominant religious ideal of extreme sense-\ncontrol and the practice of desirelessness, tried to formulate certain\nprinciples and methods by which one could attain his highest goal not by\nsense-control but by sense-enjoyments. In these schemes, sense-indulgence\nunder certain specified conditions was considered not only harmless but an\nindispensable desideratum.\n\np. 123\n\n[paragraph continues] They probably started among some of the Buddhist schools\nand they soon became very common among certain sects of the Hindus. But the\nelucidation of these ideas would require a special course of lectures. I\nshall, therefore, leave them and pass directly to the development of the\nmysticism of love to God, as it is presented in the Bhagavata Purana and other\nrelevant later literature. 8\n\nIt is in the Bhagavata Purana, whose date is probably the eleventh century A.\nD., that we first meet with the idea of devotion as the supreme source of a\nbliss or spiritual enjoyment that is itself the highest goal and so completely\nusurps the place of wisdom or philosophical knowledge. Even in the Gita true\nwisdom was regarded as a fire which reduces to ashes, as it were, all the past\ndeeds whose fruits were not yet on the point of being enjoyed. But in the\nBhagavata we read (11.14) that it is bhakti which destroys all the past sins.\nThe old principle of self-surrender to God and a life spent in God-\nintoxication is the happiest of all lives. A man of such self-surrender has\nnothing else but God as his possession: he is supremely self-controlled, and\nthe enjoyment that he has from his constant association with God keeps him\nabsolutely happy and content with all things. Such a man does not aspire to\nany heavenly happiness or even to liberation. Devotion is regarded as having\nalso a protective virtue. Even an ordinary devotee who is often led away by\nhis sense attachments is so purified by this devotion that he is no longer\novercome by external attachments or passions. The Lord can be realized\n\np. 124\n\nby bhakti and by nothing else. Neither the performance of the allotted duties\nnor knowledge combined with the austere discipline of tapas can purify a man\nwho is devoid of all bhakti. This bhakti, however, is no longer the old\ncontemplative meditation of God, stirred by a deep-seated love. It is the\nebullition of feelings and emotions of attachment to God. It manifests itself\nin the soft melting of the heart and expresses itself in tears, inarticulate\nutterances of speech, laughter, songs and dances, such as can only be possible\nthrough a mad intoxication of love. This kind of bhakti is entirely different\nfrom the calm contemplative life of complete self-abnegation and self-\nsurrender to God and a mind wholly immersed in God and the thought of God. 9\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana is aware of the three methods of approach by knowledge,\nwork and devotion, and also of the approach through yoga. Moreover, while\nemphasizing the superiority of devotion, it does not deny the efficacy of the\nother methods of approach. The latter are also described in the Gita; indeed,\nthe Gita also emphasizes the bhakti method. Both the Gita and Bhagavata\ncriticize the older course of the Vedic sacrifices, but neither of them has\nthe boldness to pass an unconditional condemnation. The Gita says that one\nshould perform these sacrifices, which are obligatory, with a pure and\ndesireless mind. The fault of those who devote themselves to sacrifices is\nthat they are filled with ordinary desires for pleasures and are not\nacquainted with any higher goal of life. To one who is infused with the higher\nideal of life and can\n\np. 125\n\nemancipate himself from desires by self-surrender to God, the performance of\nsacrifices, as of any other kinds of action, can do no harm. Indeed, it is\ngood that under these circumstances one should not forsake his allotted\nduties.\n\nThe Bhagavata holds that the only efficacy of the Vedic restrictions and\nprohibitions is to be found in the fact that they offer a check on the natural\ninclinations of man and ultimately help him to desist from sense-activities\nand sense-propensities. The promise of heavenly rewards as the result of the\nperformance of sacrifices is only a trick to incline people to accommodate\nthemselves to modes of life offering only a restricted scope of sense-\ngratification. Its appeal is therefore only to those of the lowest plane.\nThose who are of the next higher order and have been able to accommodate\nthemselves to a life of desirelessness would perform the obligatory duties\nwithout in the least looking forward to their fruits. In the next higher\nstage, a man may follow the path of yoga, or the path of wisdom respecting the\nsupreme unity of  Brahman, or any other line of devotion. 10\n\nThe path of devotion, however, is most fitted for those who are neither too\nmuch attached to sense-desires nor too much detached from them. Such men may\nadopt the line of bhakti and thereby purify their minds and, by self-surrender\nto God and the taste of supreme human happiness in their love, become averse\nto all other desires and enjoyments. Thus they learn to live a life of supreme\ndevotion. They come to experience such intense happiness that all their limbs\n\np. 126\n\nand senses become saturated therewith and their minds swim, as it were, in a\nlake of such supreme bliss that even the bliss of ultimate liberation loses\nits charm. Such an individual desires to live on, enjoying the love of God\nwith heart, soul and body. When he acquires such a bhakti, it purifies his\nmind from all passions and impurities, and destroys all the bonds of his deeds\nand their fruits. For such a person is so attached to God that there is\nnothing else for which he cares; without any effort on his part, other\nattachments and inclinations lose their hold over him. So great is his passion\nfor God that it consumes all his earthly passions. It is so great that it is\nits own satisfaction; it seeks nothing beyond itself. It stands by itself. As\na great spring of happiness, it is ultimate and self-complete.\n\nThe bhakta who is filled with such a passion does not experience it merely as\nan undercurrent of joy which waters the depths of his heart in his own\nprivacy, but as a torrent that overflows the caverns of his heart into all his\nsenses. Through all his senses he realizes it as if it were a sensuous\ndelight; with his heart and soul he feels it as a spiritual intoxication of\njoy. Such a person is beside himself with this love of God. He sings, laughs,\ndances and weeps. He is no longer a person of this world. The germ of this\nlove is already found in the Vishnu Purana, where Prahlada seeks as a boon\nthat bhakti which is an attachment for God no less strong than the attraction\nto sense-objects felt by ordinary sensual persons. 11\n\nVallabha, a later writer, defines bhakti as a great,\n\np. 127\n\nfirm feeling of love, associated with a sense of God\'s superiority and\ngreatness. It places the bhakta or the devotee in a subordinate position. The\nlatter is described as approaching God as one approaches his master, desiring\nmercy and protection and soliciting His special grace. But this idea of\nseeking protection and special grace, with a sense of God\'s supreme\nsuperiority, and finding oneself happy in thinking of the greatness of the\nsuperior Being, is by no means restricted to Hindu circles. There are numerous\nevidences of Buddhists praising the Buddha and seeking his protection, and\nfinding great joy in extolling his great qualities and powers. Bhaktishataka\nof Ramachandra Bharati of the 13th century may be referred to as a typical\ninstance.\n\nThis kind of bhakti is also associated with the doctrine of prapatti, or\ntaking refuge in God, and is to be found among many classes of Vaishnavas,\nincluding the followers of Ramanuja. Prapatti consists in taking refuge in God\nwith great faith and with the strong conviction that it is God and God alone\nwho can help one to attain one\'s end. Like the fabled bird Chataka that would\nrather die of thirst than drink any water other than that falling from the\nclouds, the devotee looks to God for succor, and would seek no other help.\nBelieving that God alone is the saviour, the devotee depends entirely on Him,\nand refuses to take any other course than that of remaining in entire\ndependence upon Him. God, for him, is the great master of whom he is the\nhumble servant; God is the controller alike of his mind and his body. 12\n\np. 128\n\nThis is only a detailed method of the self-surrender already referred to in\nthe Gita. Naturally the latter also is based on a belief in the great mercy of\nGod, who is sure to free the devotee who with complete reliance has taken\nrefuge in Him as his master and Lord. But in this case the prapatti or taking\nrefuge in God is always with a purpose. It is for the realization of an end\nthat the devotee relies on the mercy, goodness or grace of God. He believes\nthat he can by this means alone attain what he wants. But the bhakti praised\nin the Bhagavata is of a sort superior to this. It is a devotion without\nmotive of any kind. It is the love of God proceeding directly from the heart\nand not prompted by any reason. The true bhakta does not love God because he\nseeks something from Him, but he loves Him freely and spontaneously. He\nsacrifices everything for this love. It is his only passion in life and he is\nfilled with God. God is attracted by such love and always abides with such a\nbhakta and encourages his great love for him. All distinctions of caste, creed\nor social status vanish for those who are filled with this true and sincere\ndevotion to God. It is a great leveller. To the eye of a true bhakta all\nbeings are but manifestations of God\'s power, and they are all equal. Impelled\nby this idea of universal equality and by the idea of God being in all things\nand all things in God, he is filled with such a sweetness of temper that\nhowsoever he may be tyrannized over by any one he cannot think of inflicting\nany injury in return. Nor can he remain unaffected when\n\np. 129\n\nhe sees the sufferings of his fellow-beings, however lowly or depraved they\nmay be. 13\n\nThe question is sometimes asked whether such devotional systems of mysticism\nare pantheistic. To this no satisfactory reply can be given without a proper\ndefinition of pantheism. Without entering into any discussion regarding the\nmeaning of this term or the distinctive metaphysical features of the different\nsystems of Vaishnavism, I can here say only that all these systems in a manner\nagree as to the duality of God and man. They consider man as a manifestation\nof the power of God. Though ultimately sustained and always controlled by God,\nman is for all empirical purposes different from Him. This psychological,\nlogical and ontological difference between God and man is the basis of\ndevotion and worship. In the development of devotion there may, however, come\na stage in the mind of the devotee when he becomes one with the Lord in the\nexuberance of his feelings. But at the next instant the experience may again\nbe differentiated into a feeling of duality and of distinction between him and\nGod. The devotee may then come to regard himself as a servant of God or His\nson, or friend, or spouse. It cannot be said, in this inner dialectic of\nfeeling, which of the phases is the truer and has a greater claim to our\nacceptance. For we have here an alternation of feeling which sometimes\nexpresses itself as an experience of communion or contemplative unity with God\nand then by its own inner movement passes for its own realization into the\nvarious other modes of relationships through which\n\np. 130\n\nordinary human love expresses itself. It is a circular movement. At one stage\nwithin it, man becomes God, but, at the other, God slowly becomes man and\nparticipates with him in diverse human relationships of love and its joys. 14\n\nLove of God is not a thing which we produce in ourselves by excessive brooding\nor by self-hypnotism or by any other method. It is a permanent flame, slowly\nburning in the caverns of all our hearts. Only, however, when it gains\nstrength through study, and through association with other devotees at an\nopportune moment, do we come to know of it. The basis of all religions is this\nlove of God. For if this love of God were not vital to us, all that the great\nprophets have been trying to preach would have been unreal and futile. If it\nwere not a real experience which in some sense is shared by us all, an\nexperience which ennobles us and raises us far above the selfish pettinesses\nof life, no prophet and no religious deed would be able to appeal to our\nhigher natures and establish the claims of religion. Religion is by nature an\nother-worldly attitude of life--one which we have along with our worldly\nattitude. "Man does not live by bread alone," is a very elastic proposition.\nIf we by nature wanted only that which satisfies our appetites, there would\nhave been no art, no philosophy, and no religion. Our being is such that side\nby side with the tendencies that take us to the satisfaction of our appetites\nor to sense-gratifications, there are others which in an unaccountable manner\nlift us higher. The senses when properly exercised give us sense pleasures;\nthe mind,\n\np. 131\n\nthrough its activities of logical thinking, affords the corresponding joys and\nthe satisfaction of truth-seeking; and the spirit longs to associate itself\nwith some higher ideal, with a greater and superior being, or with a\ntranscendent unspeakable something of which it has at first only an indistinct\nvision. 15\n\nReason moves within a circle and cannot get beyond it. When the ultimate\nreason of reasoning is to be sought, we have to rest in a tendency,\ntemperament or feeling. Ask a philosopher why he engages in philosophical\nspeculation. He may say that he seeks to know the truth of some particular or\nsome universal problem. But ask him again why he so seeks and he will probably\nsay that he does it because he finds therein a special satisfaction. The\nsatisfaction, though not measureable in physical terms, is yet enough for him.\nHe possesses intellectual curiosity and it must be gratified. Ask a scientist\nand you will probably receive the same answer. One can never explain our\nendeavors in any of the higher planes of life, philosophy, art or religion, by\nreference to any of the ordinary needs and objects of life. These higher\nactivities are apparently without any reason, but still they justify\nthemselves and they are our very existence. That bread alone should not\nsatisfy man is part of his very nature and there is no getting away therefrom.\nIt is an absolute fact with man. The case of religion is very similar. There\nis a spiritual longing in the heart of man, indistinct and undefined, but\nsteady like a flame tapering upwards to some divine goal. The mystics of the\nBhagavata Purana of whom I am now\n\np. 132\n\nspeaking called it the love of God. They felt that there is nothing higher\nthan the culture of this love. The seed of it they regarded as latent within\nthe individual. Hearing and singing the praises of God stimulates its growth--\nsprinkles it with water, as it were--until it ascends higher and higher and\neventually reaches God. Like an expert gardener the individual has always to\nsee that no beast of a sin, tramples this tender creeper, and that no\noffshoots, no branches of worldly desires, obstruct its upward growth.\nWhenever he is tempted by worldly desires or to pray to God for worldly good,\nhe is allowing offshoots to grow on the body of the tender creeper of God\'s\nlove and to interfere with its upward growth. He must cut them off and make\nthe creeper of love grow freely in one direction, until it connects him with\nGod and he thus comes to enjoy its sweet fruits. 16\n\nThe type of bhakti which is preached in the Bhagavata Purana is well\nillustrated in the life of Chaitanya, who was born in Navadvip, in Bengal, in\n1486 and died in 1534. In his life we find an exemplification of how love of\nGod may be cultivated for its own sake, without any kind of ulterior motive\nwhether of liberation or of happiness. In the accounts which his biographers\nhave given of his mysticism, a distinction is drawn between the experience of\nGod\'s love as self-surrender to Him, or taking refuge in Him through\nattachment to Him, and a driving passion of love for God, i.e., between what\nthey call _rati_ and _preman_. A distinction is also drawn between a course of\nattachment and love of God adopted out of a sense\n\np. 133\n\nof duty or of reverence for the scriptures and a passion of love which springs\nspontaneously and overflows unrestrainedly. A distinction is further made\nbetween love of God with an overwhelming sense of His greatness and\nsuperiority, awe and reverence, and love of God as an easy flow of affection\nto one who is nearest and dearest to us. Real intimacy with God is only\npossible in the case of the latter alternative, when a free flow of passionate\nlove springing spontaneously from within associates us with God as the most\nintimate friend and beloved without whom we cannot live. Chaitanya\nacknowledges, of course, the peaceful calm and tender love for God called\n_shanta_ , and the submission of the heart to God in obligation and service to\nHim, called the service attitude, _dasya_ ; but to look upon God as one\'s own\nmost intimate friend, _sakhya_ , is regarded by him as higher than either of\nthe first two attitudes. To look upon God as one\'s dearest beloved or lover,\nor to love Him with a feminine love as that with which a woman loves her\nbeloved, he considers the deepest, sweetest and most perfect love, _madhura_.\n17\n\nAccording to the legend, Lord Krishna was born of Devaki and Vasudeva in a\nprison-house where the King Kansa, who was afraid of the birth of the infant\nwho was foretold to be his future destroyer, had confined his mother Devaki.\nLater Krishna was carried to the house of a cowherd chief, Nanda. There he\ngrew up, having as his associates cowherd boys with whom he was very friendly.\nHe came to be regarded as God incarnate, as the result of a number\n\np. 134\n\nof miracles which he performed. The wives of most of the cowherd people, who\nwere, in reality but the female incarnations of God\'s energy, became attached\nto him and loved him dearly. They were sorely pained over the separation when\nhe later on left for Mathura, a city at some distance from Brindaban, the\nscene of his early activities. Krishna\'s early life illustrates the love for\nhim of his fostermother Yashoda, wife of the cowherd chief Nanda, the love for\nhim of his cowherd friends, and the love of the cowherd girls for him as their\nlover. Inasmuch as Krishna was considered to be God, these three kinds of love\nfor Krishna as described in the tenth chapter of the Bhagavata Purana,\ntogether with the other two time-honored modes of loving God, viz., the\npeaceful quiet love of God and the love of God as God\'s servant, came to be\nconsidered as the five fundamental modes of loving God. The attention of the\nlater Vaishnavas was so much drawn to the excellence of the three kinds of\nlove described in the Bhagavata, and particularly of the love of God as one\'s\nlover, that no less than four-teen commentaries have been published dealing\nwith this portion of the Bhagavata Purana. Love of Krishna was the most\nabsorbing passion of Chaitanya\'s life and, though he came to taste all the\ndifferent ways of loving God, it was the sweet love of Krishna as the lover,\nhusband and Lord that was the most important feature of his life. 18\n\nChaitanya\'s elder brother had turned a recluse. So his mother Sachi Devi would\nnot at first send Chaitanya to school, since she believed that it is through\n\np. 135\n\nknowledge that one learns the transitoriness of all things, and she thought it\nbetter that her son should grow untutored than that he become learned and\nrenounce the world. So Chaitanya, or Nimai as he was called in his early life,\ngrew wild. But he gradually grew so wild that he could no longer be tolerated,\nand so he was sent to school. He mastered Sanskrit grammar and logic very\nthoroughly and at twenty started a school himself. Numerous anecdotes are told\nby his biographers of his great scholarship and of occasions when he defeated\nreputed scholars in open debates. At this period he scoffed at all religions\nand was considered by many to be absolutely godless. In the meanwhile he had\nsettled down in life. His first wife having died, he married again. But at\nthis time Chaitanya\'s deeper nature began to reveal itself and he wanted to\nvisit the temple of the God Krishna at Gaya, several hundred miles distant\nfrom his village. On his way thither he met a great Vaishnava saint and at his\nsight his higher spiritual life was stirred into life. When he reached the\ntemple of Gaya he experienced a rapturous fervor of love for Krishna, and he\nbecame an entirely different man. "Where is my God Krishna," became his chief\ncry. In thinking of Krishna, in seeking Him, in relating his vision of Him, he\nwould be so overpowered as often to become unconscious. It was in this\ncondition that he was brought home from Gaya by his friends. He spent his days\nand nights in reciting and singing the name of God. He, his intimate friend\nNityananda, and his other friends used thus to sing the name of God and to\ndance\n\np. 136\n\nabout with a particular type of music produced by special musical instruments.\nThis music touched the inner, spiritual chords of life and brought on a great\nreligious intoxication in all the hearers, and particularly in Chaitanya and\nhis followers. Chaitanya lived continually in this state of religious\nintoxication. He had no respect for caste or creeds but was a friend of all.\nHe could not continue this sort of life midst the worldly conditions of his\nnative village. Hence he renounced the world to preach the love of God all\nover India. In this work he spent the rest of his years, going about from\nplace to place, thousands of miles, on foot. The vision of God was always\nbefore him in the form of Lord Krishna. His whole life was a passionate flow\nof love for this deity, and this emotion was generally so intense that as he\nsang and danced like a mad man he often became unconscious. He had so\nthoroughly identified himself as a partner in the episodes of the life of\nKrishna as described in the Bhagavata that the slightest incidents deriving\neither from personal conversations and relations or from the scenes of nature\nsufficed to suggest to him similar adventures or events in the life of\nKrishna. 19\n\nChaitanya described God\'s love in its most exalted form as being like the love\nof a woman in deep attachment to a man, where the attachment is so deep that\nall sex considerations have ceased a love so intense that only an insatiable\ndesire of union in love remains and all the earthly relations of man and woman\nhave ceased. God, he taught, is himself a great controller of us all, and in\nHis eternal love is always attracting\n\np. 137\n\nus, drawing us up toward greater and greater perfection. Love is His very\nnature. So it is only through a passionate love of Him that we can enjoy His\ndeep love for us. The older ideals of liberation, of heavenly happiness, of\nthe destruction of the mind and the like were considered by Chaitanya to be\nabsolutely insignificant for a person whose mind has been fired by a great\npassion that flows in torrents to God, the great ocean of love, who washes\naway all his sins and defects. In the end, Chaitanya, in an outbreak of divine\npassion which he was unable to restrain, jumped into the deep blue ocean on\nthe South and was lost forever to human eyes. So passed away one drop of God\'s\nlove in human shape into that eternal and limitless Ocean of divine love from\nwhich it had descended upon the earth. 20\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Lecture VI.
