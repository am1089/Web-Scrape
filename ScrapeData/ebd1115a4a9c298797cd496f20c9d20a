It is shown by our passage and the corresponding ones in the other\nSutras that the true reading is Agnaye. Instead of aharsham we should read\naharsham, as all the parallel texts have. In the passage 'Firewood art thou;\nmight we prosper,' there is a play upon words untranslatable in English,\n'edho\xe0\xa4\xbdsy edhishimahi.' Perhaps instead of samiddho ma _m_ samardhaya we should\nread sam _ri_ ddho ma _m_ samardhaya. As the Mantra referred to the Samidh-\noffering, sam _ri_ ddha could very easily be supplanted by the participle of\nsam-idh. In the parallel texts indicated p. 139 of the German edition it\nshould be, Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. II, 14 a.\n\n[76:7](sbe29040.htm#fr_168) This Sutra is wanting in one of the Haug MSS. and\nin the _S_ ambavya MS.; Rama _k_ andra's Paddhati takes no notice of it. I\ntake it for a later addition. It should be noticed that the words dakshi _n_\naskandhe . . . _k_ a pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ asu form a half _S_ loka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 11](sbe29041.htm)\n\n"
