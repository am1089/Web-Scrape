Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# RAMAYANA BOOK III\n\n# DASA-RATHA-VIYOGA\n\n_\n\n(The Death of the King)\n\n_\n\nTHE first six days of Rama\'s wanderings are narrated in this Book. Sita and\nthe faithful Lakshman accompanied Rama in his exile, and the loyal people of\nAyodhya followed their exiled prince as far as the banks of the Tamasa river,\nwhere they halted on the first night. Rama had to steal away at night to\nescape the citizens, and his wanderings during the following days give us\nbeautiful glimpses of forest life in holy hermitages. Thirty centuries have\npassed since the age of the Kosalas and Videhas, but every step of the\nsupposed journey of Rama is well known in India to this day, and is annually\ntraversed by thousands of devoted pilgrims. The past is not dead and buried in\nIndia, it lives in the hearts of millions of faithful men and faithful women,\nand shall live for ever.\n\nOn the third day of their exile, Rama and his wife and brother crossed the\nGanges; on the fourth day they came to the hermitage of Bharad-vaja, which\nstood where Allahabad now stands, on the confluence of the Ganges and the\nJumna; on the fifth day they crossed the Jumna, the southern shores of which\nwere then covered with woods; and on the sixth day they came to the hill of\nChitra kuta, where they met the saint Valmiki, the reputed author of this\nEpic. "We have often looked," says a writer in _Calcutta Review_ , vol. xxii,\n"on that green hill: it is the holiest spot of that sect of the Hindu faith\nwho devote themselves to this incarnation of Vishnu. The whole neighbourhood\nis Rama\'s country. Every headland has some legend, every cavern is connected\nwith his name, some of the wild fruits are still called Sita-phal, being the\nreputed food of the exile. Thousands and thousands annually visit the spot,\nand round the hill is raised a footpath on which the devotee, with naked feet,\ntreads full of pious awe."\n\nGrief for the banished Rama pressed on the ancient heart of Dasa-ratha. The\nfeeble old king pined away and died, remembering and recounting on his death-\nbed how in his youth he had caused sorrow and death to an old hermit by\nkilling his son. Scarcely any passage in the Epic is more touching than this\nold sad story told by the dying monarch.\n\nThe portions translated in this Book form the whole or the main portions of\nSections xxvi., xxvii., xxxi., xxxix., xl., xlvi., Iii., liv., lv., lvi.,\n1xiii., and lxiv. of Book ii. of the original text.\n\n## I\n\n## WOMAN\'S LOVE\n\n"Dearly loved, devoted Sita! daughter of a royal line,  \nPart we now, for years of wand\'ring in the pathless woods is mine,\n\nFor my father, promise-fettered, to Kaikeyi yields the sway,  \nAnd she wills her son anointed,-fourteen years doth Rama stray,\n\nBut before I leave thee, Sita, in the wilderness to rove,  \nYield me one more tender token of thy true and trustful love!\n\nServe my crowned brother, Sita, as a faithful, duteous dame,  \nTell him not of Rama\'s virtues, tell him not of Rama\'s claim,\n\nSince my royal father willeth,--Bharat shall be regent-heir,  \nServe him with a loyal duty, serve him with obeisance fair,\n\nSince my roval father willetb,-years of banishment be mine,  \nBrave in sorrow and in suffering, woman\'s brightest fame be thine\n\nKeep thy fasts and vigils, Sita, while thy Rama is away,  \nFaith in Gods and faith in virtue on thy bosom hold their sway,\n\nIn the early watch of morning to the Gods for blessings pray,  \nTo my father Dasa-ratha honour and obeisance pay,\n\nTo my mother, Queen Kausalya, is thy dearest tendance due,  \nOffer her thy consolation, be a daughter fond and true!\n\nQueen Kaikeyi and Sumitra equal love and honour claim,  \nWith a soothing soft endearment sweetly serve each royal dame,\n\nCherish Bharat and Satrughna with a sister\'s watchful love,  \nAnd a mother\'s true affection and a mother\'s kindness prove!\n\nListen, Sita, unto Bharat speak no heedless angry word,  \nHe is monarch of Kosala and of Raghu\'s race is lord,\n\nCrowned kings our willing service and our faithful duty own,  \nDearest song they disinherit, cherish strangers near the throne!\n\nBharat\'s will with deep devotion and with faultless faith obey,  \nTruth and virtue on thy bosom ever hold their gentle sway,\n\nAnd to please each dear relation, gentle Sita, be it thine,  \nPart we love! for years of wand\'ring in the pathless woods is mine!"\n\nRama spake, and soft-eyed Sita, ever sweet in speech and word,  \nStirred by loving woman\'s passion boldly answered thus her lord:\n\n"Do I hear my husband rightly, are these words my Rama spake,  \nAnd her banished lord and husband will the wedded wife forsake?\n\nLightly I dismiss the counsel which my lord hath lightly said  \nFor it ill beseems a warrior and my husband\'s princely grade;\n\n_\n\nFor the faithful woman follows where her wedded lord may lead,  \nIn the banishment of Rama, Sita\'s exile is decreed,\n\nSire nor son nor loving brother rules the wedded woman\'s state,  \nWith her lord she falls or rises, with her consort courts her fate,\n\nIf the righteous son of Raghu wends to forests dark and drear,  \nSita steps before her husband wild and thorny path to clear!\n\n_\n\nLike the tasted refuse water cast thy timid thoughts aside,  \nTake me to the pathless jungle, bid me by my lord abide,\n\nCar and steed and gilded palace, vain are these to woman\'s life,  \nDearer is her husband\'s shadow to the loved and loving wife!\n\nFor my mother often taught me and my father often spake,  \nThat her home the wedded woman doth beside her husband make,\n\nAs the shadow to the substance, to her lord is faithful wife,  \nAnd she parts not from her consort till she parts with fleeting life!\n\nTherefore bid me seek the jungle and in pathless forests roam,  \nWhere the wild deer freely ranges and the tiger makes his home,\n\nHappier than in father\'s mansions in the woods will Sita rove,  \nWaste no thought on home or kindred, nestling in her husband\'s love!\n\nWorld-renowned is Rama\'s valour, fearless by her Rama\'s side,  \nSita will still live and wander with a faithful woman\'s pride,\n\nAnd the wild fruit she will gather from the fresh and fragrant wood,  \nAnd the food by Rama tasted shall be Sita\'s cherished food!\n\nBid me seek the sylvan greenwoods, wooded hills and plateaus high,  \nLimpid rills and crystal _nullas_ as they softly ripple by,\n\nAnd where in the lake of lotus tuneful ducks their plumage lave,  \nLet me with my loving Rama skim the cool translucent wave!\n\nYears will pass in happy union,--happiest lot to woman given,--  \nSita seeks not throne or empire, nor the brighter joys of heaven,\n\nHeaven conceals not brighter mansions in its sunny fields of pride,  \nWhere without her lord and husband faithful Sita would reside!\n\nTherefore let me seek the jungle where the jungle-rangers rove,  \nDearer than the royal palace, where I share my husband\'s love,\n\nAnd my heart in sweet communion shall my Rama\'s wishes share,  \nAnd my wifely toil shall lighten Rama\'s load of woe and care!"\n\nVainly gentle Rama pleaded dangers of the jungle life,  \nVainly spake of toil and trial to a true and tender wife!\n\n## II\n\n## BROTHER\'S FAITHFULNESS\n\nTears bedewed the face of Lakshman as he heard what Sita, said,  \nAnd he touched the feet of Rama and in gentle accents prayed:\n\n_\n\n"If my elder and his lady to the pathless forests wend,  \nArmed with bow and ample quiver Lakshman will on them attend,\n\nWhere the wild deer range the forest and the lordly tuskers roam,  \nAnd the bird of gorgeous plumage nestles in its jungle home,\n\nDearer far to me those woodlands where my elder Rama dwells,  \nThan the homes of bright Immortals where perennial bliss prevails!\n\n_\n\nGrant me then thy sweet permission,--faithful to thy glorious star,  \nLakshman,shall not wait and tarry when his Rama wanders far,\n\nGrant me then thyloving mandate,--Lakshman hath no wish to stay,  \nNone shall bar the faithful younger when the elder leads the way!"\n\n"Ever true to deeds of virtue, duteous brother, faithful friend,  \nDearer than his life to Rama, thou shall not to forests wend,\n\nWho shall stay by Queen Kausalya, Lakshman, if we both depart,  \nWho shall stay by Queen Sumitra, she who nursed thee on her heart?\n\nFor the king our aged father, he who ruled the earth and main,  \nIs a captive to Kaikeyi, fettered by her silken chain,\n\nLittle help Kaikeyi renders to our mothers in her pride,  \nLittle help can Bharat offer, standing by his mother\'s side.\n\nThou alone can\'st serve Kausalya when for distant woods I part,  \nWhen the memory of my exile rankles in her sorrowing heart,\n\nThou alone can\'st serve Sumitra, soothe her sorrows with thy love,  \nStay by them, my faithful Lakshman, and thy filial virtues prove,\n\nBe this then they sacred duty, tend our mothers in their woe,  \nLittle joy or consolation have they left on earth below!"\n\nSpake the hero: "Fear no evil, well is Rama\'s prowess known,  \nAnd to mighty Rama\'s mother Bharat will obeisance own,\n\nNathless if the pride of empire sways him from the righteous path,  \nBlood will venge the offered insult and will quench our filial wrath!\n\nBut a thousand peopled hamlets Queen Kausalya\'s hests obey,  \nAnd a thousand armed champions own her high and queenly sway,\n\nAye, a thousand village-centres Queen Sumitra\'s state maintain,  \nAnd a thousand swords like Lakshman\'s guard her proud and prosperous reign!\n\nAll alone with gentle Sita thou shalt track thy darksome way,  \nGrant it, that thy faithful Lakshman shall protect her night and day,\n\nGrant it, with his bow and quiver Lakshman shall the forests roam,  \nAnd his axe shall fell the jungle, and his hands shall rear the home!\n\nGrant it, in the deepest woodlands he shall seek the forest fruit,  \nBerries dear to holy hermits and the sweet and luscious root,\n\nAnd whenwith thy meek-eyed Sita thou shalt seek the mountain crest,  \nGrant it, Lakshman ever duteous watch and guard thy nightly rest!"\n\nWords of brother\'s deep devotion Rama heard with grateful heart,  \nAnd with Sita and with Lakshman for the woods prepared to part:\n\nPart we then from loving kinsmen, arms and mighty weapons bring,  \nBows of war which Lord VARUNA rendered to Videha\'s king,\n\nCoats of mail to sword impervious, quivers which can never fail,  \nAnd the rapiers bright as sunshine, golden-hilted, tempered wen,\n\nSafely rest these goodly weapons in our great preceptor\'s hall,  \nSeekand bring them, faithful brother, for me thinks we need them all!"\n\nRama spake; his valiant brother then the wondrous weapons brought,  \nWreathed with fresh and fragrant garlands and with gold and jewels wrought,\n\n"Welcome, brother," uttered Rama, "stronger thus to woods we go,  \nWealth and gold and useless treasure to the holy priests bestow,\n\nTo the son of saint Vasishtha, to each sage is honour due,  \nThen we leave our father\'s mansions, to our father\'s mandate true!"\n\n## III\n\n## MOTHER\'S BLESSINGS\n\nTears of sorrow and of suffering flowed from Queen Kausalya\'s eye,  \nAs she saw departing Sita for her blessings drawing nigh,\n\nAnd she clasped the gentle Sits, and she kissed her moistened head,  \nAnd her tears like summer tempest choked the loving words she said:\n\n"Part we, dear devoted daughter, to thy husband ever true,  \nWith a woman\'s whole affection render love to husband\'s due!\n\nFalse are women loved and cherished, gentle in their speech and word,  \nWhen misfortune\'s shadows gather, who are faithless to their lord,\n\nWho through years of sunny splendour smile and pass the livelong day,  \nWhen misfortune\'s darkness thickens, from their husband turn away,\n\nWho with changeful fortune changing oft ignore the plighted word,  \nAnd forget a woman\'s duty, woman\'s faith to wedded lord,\n\nWho to holy love inconstant from their wedded consort part,  \nManly deed nor manly virtue wins the changeful woman\'s heart!\n\nBut the true and righteous woman, loving, spouse and changeless wife,  \nFaithful to her lord and consort holds him dearer than her life,\n\nEver true and righteous Sita, follow still my godlike son,  \nLike a God to thee is Rama in the woods or on the throne!"\n\n"I shall do my duty, mother," said the wife with wifely pride,  \n"Like a God to me is Rama, Sita shall not leave his side,\n\nFrom the Moon will part his lustre ere I part from wedded lord,  \nEre from faithful wife\'s devotion falter in my deed or word,\n\nFor the stringless lute is silent, idle is the wheel-less car,  \nAnd no wife the loveless consort, inauspicious is her star!\n\nSmall the measure of affection which the sire and brother prove,  \nMeasureless to wedded woman is her lord and husband\'s love,\n\nTrue to Law and true to Scriptures, true to woman\'s plighted word,  \nCan I ever be, my mother, faithless, loveless to my lord?"\n\nTears of joy and mingled sorrow filled the Queen Kausalya\'s eye,  \nAs she marked the faithful Sita true in heart, in virtue high,\n\nAnd she wept the tears of sadness when with sweet obeisance due,  \nSpake with hands in meekness folded Rama ever good and true:\n\n"Sorrow not, my loving mother, trust in virtue\'s changeless beam,  \nSwift will fly the years of exile like a brief and transient dream,\n\nGirt by faithful friends and forces, blest by righteous Gods above,  \nThou shalt see thy son returning to thy bosom and thy love!\n\nUnto all the royal ladies Rama his obeisance paid,  \nFor his failings unremembered, blessings and forgiveness prayed,\n\nAnd his words were soft and gentle, and they wept to see him go,  \nLike the piercing cry of curlew rose the piercing voice of woe,\n\nAnd in halls where drum and tabor rose in joy and regal pride,  \nVoice of grief and lamentation sounded far and sounded wide!\n\nThen the true and faithful Lakshman parted from each weeping dame,  \nAnd to sorrowing Queen Sumitra with his due obeisance came,\n\nAnd he bowed to Queen Sumitra and his mother kissed his head,  \nStilled her anguish-laden bosom and in trembling accents said:\n\nDear devoted duteous Lakshman, ever to thy elder true,  \nWhen thy elder wends to forest, forest-life to thee is due,\n\nThou hast served him true and faithful in his glory and his fame,  \nThis is Law for true and righteous,---serve him in his woe and shame,\n\nThis is Law for race of Raghu known on earth for holy might,  \nBounteous in their sacred duty, brave and warlike in the fight!\n\nTherefore tend him as thy father, as thy mother tend his wife,  \nAnd to thee, like fair Ayodhya be thy humble forest life,\n\nGo, my son, the voice of Duty bids my gallant Lakshman go,  \nServe thy elder with devotion and with valour meet thy foe\n\n## IV\n\n## CITIZENS\' LAMENT\n\nSpake Sumantra chariot-driver waiting by the royal car,  \n"Haste thee, mighty-destined Rama, for we wander long and far,\n\nFourteen years in Dandak\'s forest shall the righteous Rama stray,  \nSuch is Dasa-ratha\'s mandate, haste thee Rama and obey."\n\nQueenly Sita bright-apparelled, with a strong and trusting heart,  \nMounted on the car of splendour for the pathless woods to part,\n\nAnd the king for needs providing gave her robes and precious store,  \nFor the many years of exile in a far and unknown shore,\n\nAnd a wealth of warlike weapons to the exiled princes gave,  \nBow and dart and linked armour, sword and shield and lances brave.\n\nThen the gallant brothers mounted on the gold-emblazoned car,  \nFor unending was the journey and the wilderness was far,\n\nSkilled Sumantra saw them seated, urged the swiftly-flying steed,  \nFaster than the speed of tempest was the noble coursers\' speed.\n\nAnd they parted for the forest; like a long unending night,  \nGloomy shades of grief and sadness deepened on the city\'s might,\n\nMute and dumb but conscious creatures felt the woe the city bore,  \nHorses neighed and shook their bright bells, elephants returned a roar!\n\nMan and boy and maid and matron followed Rama with their eye,  \nAs the thirsty seek the water when the parched fields are dry,\n\nClinging to the rapid chariot, by its side, before, behind,  \nTlironging men and wailing women wept for Rama good and kind:\n\n"Draw the reins, benign Sumantra, slowly drive the royal car,  \nWe would once more see our Rama, banished Iong and banished far,\n\nIron-hearted is Kausalya from her Rama thus to part,  \nRends it not her mother\'s bosom thus to see her son depart?\n\nTrue is righteous-hearted Sita cleaving to her husband still,  \nAs the ever present sunlight cleaves to Meru\'s golden hill,\n\nFaithful and heroic Lakshman! thou hast by thy brother stood,  \nAnd in duty still unchanging thou hast sought the pathless wood,\n\nFixed in purpose, true in valour, mighty boon to thee is given,  \nAnd the narrow path thou choosest is the righteous path to heaven!"\n\nThus they spake in tears and anguish as they followed him apace,  \nAnd their eyes were fixed on Rama, pride of Raghu\'s royal race,\n\nMeanwhile ancient Dasa-ratha from his palace chamber came,  \nWith each weeping queen and consort, with each woe-distracted dame!\n\nAnd around the aged monarch rose the piercing voice of pain,  \nLike the wail of forest creatures when the forest-king is slain,\n\nAnd the faint and feeble monarch was with age and anguish pale,  \nLike the darkened moon at eclipse when his light and radiance fail!\n\nRama saw his ancient father with a faltering footstep go,  \nUsed to royal pomp and splendour, stricken now by age and woe,\n\nSaw his mother faint and feeble to the speeding chariot hie,  \nAs the mother-cow returneth to her young that loiters by,\n\nStill she hastened to the chariot, "Rama! Rama!" was her cry,  \nAnd a throb was in her bosom and a tear was in her eye!\n\n"Speed, Sumantra," uttered Rama, "from this torture let me part.  \nSpeed, my friend, this sight of sadness breaks a much-enduring heart,\n\nHeed not Dasa-ratha\'s mandate, stop not for the royal train,  \nParting slow is lengthened sorrow like the sinner\'s lengthened pain!"\n\nSad Sumantra urged the coursers and the rapid chariot flew,  \nAnd the royal chiefs and courtiers round their fainting monarch drew,\n\nAnd they spake to Dasa-ratha: "Follow not thy banished son,  \nHe whom thou wouldst keep beside thee comes not till his task is done!"\n\nDasa-ratha, faint and feeble, listened to these words of pain,  \nStood and saw his son departing,--saw him not on earth again!\n\n## V\n\n## CROSSING THE TAMASA: THE CITIZENS\' RETURN\n\nEvening\'s thickening shades descended on Tamasa\'s distant shore,  \nRama rested by the river, day of toilsome journey o\'er,\n\nAnd Ayodhya\'s loving people by the limpid river lay,  \nSad and sorrowing they had followed Rama\'s chariot through the day,\n\n"Soft-eyed Sita, faithful Lakshman," thus the gentle Rama said,  \n"Hail the first night of our exile mantling us in welcome shade,\n\nWeeps the lone and voiceless forest, and in darksome lair and nest,  \nFeathered bird and forest creature seek their midnight\'s wonted rest,\n\nWeeps methinks our fair Ayodhya to her Rama ever dear,  \nAnd perchance her men and women shed for us a silent tear,\n\nLoyal men and faithful women, they have loved their ancient king,  \nAnd his anguish and our exile will their gentle bosoms wring!\n\nMost I sorrow for my father and my mother loved and lost,  \nStricken by untimely anguish, by a cruel fortune crost,\n\nBut the good and righteous Bharat gently will my parents tend,  \nAnd with fond and filial duty tender consolation lend,\n\nWell I know his stainless bosom and his virtues rare and high,  \nHe will soothe our parents\' sorrow and their trickling tear will dry!\n\nFaithful Lakshman, thou hast nobly stood by us when sorrows fell,  \nGuard my Sits, by thy valour, by thy virtues tend her well,\n\nWait on her while from this river Rama seeks his thirst to slake,  \nOn this first night of his exile food nor fruit shall Rama take,\n\nThou Sumantra, tend the horses, darkness comes with close of day,  \nWeary was the endless journey, weary is our onward way!"\n\nStore of grass and welcome fodder to the steeds the driver gave,  \nGave them rest and gave them water from Tamasa\'s limpid wave,\n\nAnd performing night\'s devotions, for the princes made their bed,  \nBy the softly rippling river \'neath the tree\'s umbrageous shade.\n\nOn a bed of leaf and verdure Rama and his Sita slept,  \nFaithful Lakshman with Sumantra nightly watch and vigils kept,\n\nAnd the stars their silent lustre on the weary exiles shed,  \nAnd on wood and rolling river night her darksome mantle spread.\n\nEarly woke the righteous Rama and to watchful Lakshman spake:  \nMark the slumb\'ring city people, still their nightly rest they take,\n\nThey have left their homes and children, followed us with loyal heart,  \nThey would take us to Ayodhya, from their princes loth to part!\n\nSpeed, my brother, for the people wake not till the morning\'s star,  \nSpeed by night the silent chariot, we may travel fast and far,\n\nSo my true and loving people see us not by dawn of day,  \nFollow not through wood and jungle Rama in his onward way,\n\nFor a monarch meek in suffering should his burden bravely bear,  \nAnd his true and faithful people may not ask his woe to share!"\n\nLakshman heard the gentle mandate, and Sumantra yoked the steed,  \nFresh with rest and grateful fodder, matchless in their wondrous speed,\n\nRama with his gentle consort and with Lakshman true and brave,  \nCrossed beneath the silent starlight dark Tamasa\'s limpid wave.\n\nOn the farther bank a pathway, fair to view and far and wide,  \nStretching onwards to the forests spanned the spacious country-side,\n\n"Leave the broad and open pathway," so the gentle Rama said,  \n"Follow yet a track diverging, so the people be misled.\n\nThen returning to the pathway we shall march ere break of day,  \nSo our true and faithful people shall not know our southward way."\n\nWise Sumantra hastened northward, then returning to the road,  \nBy his master and his consort and the valiant Lakshman stood,\n\nRaghu\'s sons and gentle Sita mounted on the stately car,  \nAnd Sumantra drove the coursers travelling fast and travelling far.\n\nMorning dawned, the waking people by Tamasa\'s limpid wave,  \nSaw not Rama and his consort, saw not Lakshman young and brave,\n\nAnd the tear suffused their faces and their hearts with anguish burned,  \nSorrow-laden and lamenting to their cheerless homes returned.\n\n## VI\n\n## CROSSING THE GANGES. BHARAD-VAJA\'S HERMITAGE\n\nMorning dawned, and far they wandered, by their people loved and lost,  \nDrove through grove and flowering woodland, rippling rill and river crost,\n\nCrossed the sacred Vedasruti on their still unending way,  \nCrossed the deep and rapid Gumti where the herds of cattle stray,\n\nAll the toilsome day they travelled, evening fell o\'er wood and lea,  \nAnd they came where sea-like Ganga rolls in regal majesty,\n\n\'Neath a fall Ingudi\'s shadow by the river\'s zephyrs blest,  \nSecond night of Rama\'s exile passed in sleep and gentle rest.\n\nMorning dawned, the royal chariot Rama would no further own,  \nSent Sumantra and the coursers back to fair Ayodhya\'s town,\n\nDoffing then their royal garments Rama and his brother bold  \nCoats of bark and matted tresses wore like anchorites of old.\n\nGuha, chief of wild Nishadas, boat and needed succour gave,  \nAnd the princes and fair Sita ventured on the sacred wave.\n\nAnd by royal Rama bidden strong Nishadas plied the oar,  \nAnd the strong boat quickly bounding left fair Ganga\'s northern shore.\n\n"Goddess of the mighty Ganga!" so the pious Sits, prayed,  \n"Exiled by his father\'s mandate, Rama seeks the forest shade,\n\nGanga! o\'er the three worlds rolling, bride and empress of the sea,  \nAnd from BRAHMA\'S sphere descended! banished Sita bows to thee.\n\nMay my lord return in safety, and a thousand fattened kine,  \nGold and gifts and gorgeous garments, pure libations shall be thine,\n\nAnd with flesh and corn I worship unseen dwellers on thy shore,  \nMay my lord return in safety, fourteen years of exile o\'er!",\n\nOn the southern shore they journeyed through the long and weary day,  \nStill through grove and flowering woodland held their long and weary way,\n\nAnd they slayed the deer of jungle and they spread their rich repast,  \nThird night of the princes\' exile underneath a tree was past.\n\nMorning dawned, the soft-eyed Sits, wandered with the princes brave,  \nTo the spot where ruddy Gangs, mingles with dark Jumna\'s wave,\n\nAnd they crost the shady woodland, verdant lawn and grassy mead,  \nTill the sun was in its zenith, Rama then to Lakshman said:\n\n"Yonder mark the famed Prayaga, spot revered from age to age,  \nAnd the line of smoke ascending speaks some _rishi\'s_ hermitage,\n\nThere the waves of ruddy Gangs with the dark blue Jumna meet,  \nAnd my ear the sea-like voices of the mingling waters greet.\n\nMark the monarchs of the forest severed by the hermit\'s might,  \nAnd the logs of wood and fuel for the sacrificial rite,\n\nMark the tall trees in their blossom and the peaceful shady grove,  \nThere the sages make their dwelling, thither, Lakshman, let us rove."\n\nSlowly came the exile-wand\'rers, when the sun withdrew his rays,  \nWhere the vast and sea-like rivers met in sisters\' sweet embrace,\n\nAnd the _asram\'s_ peaceful dwellers, bird of song and spotted deer,  \nQuaked to see the princely strangers in their warlike garb appear!\n\nRama stepped with valiant Lakshman, gentle Sits followed close,  \nTill behind the screening foliage hermits\' peaceful dwellings rose,\n\nAnd they came to Bharad-vaja, anchorite and holy saint,  \nGirt by true and faithful pupils on his sacred duty bent.\n\nFamed for rites and lofty penance was the anchorite of yore,  \nBlest with more than mortal vision, deep in more than mortal tore,\n\nAnd he sat beside the altar for the _agni-hotra_ rite,  \nRama spake in humble accents to the man of holy might:\n\n"We are sons of Dasa-ratha and to thee our homage bring,  \nWith rny wife, the saintly Sita, daughter of Videha\'s king,\n\nExiled by my royal father in the wilderness I roam,  \nAnd my wife and faithful brother make the pathless woods their home,\n\nWe would through these years of exile in some holy asram dwell.  \nAnd our food shall be the wild fruit and our drink from crystal well,\n\nWe would practise pious penance still on sacred rites intent,  \nTill our souls be filled with wisdom and our years of exile spent!"\n\nPleased the ancient Bharad-vaja heard the prince\'s humble tale.  \nAnd with kind and courteous welcome royal strangers greeted well,\n\nAnd he brought the milk and _argya_ where the guests observant stood,  \nCrystal water from the fountain, berries from the darksome wood,\n\nAnd a low and leafy cottage for their dwelling-place assigned,  \nAs a host receives a stranger, welcomed them with offerings kind.\n\nIn the _asram\'s_ peaceful courtyard fearless browsed the jungle deer,  \nAll unharmed the bird of forest; pecked the grain collected near,\n\nAnd by holy men surrounded \'neath the trees\' umbrageous shade,  \nIn his pure and peaceful accents _rishi_ Bharad-vaja said:\n\nNot unknown or unexpected, princely strangers, have ye come,  \nI have heard of sinless Rama\'s causeless banishment from home,\n\nWelcome to a hermit\'s forest, be this spot your place of rest,  \nWhere the meeting of the rivers, makes our sacred _asram_ blest,\n\nLive amidst these peaceful woodlands, still on sacred rites intent  \nTill your souls be filled with wisdom and your years of exile spent!"\n\n"Gracious are thy accents, rishi," Rama answered thus the sage.  \n"But fair towns and peopled hamlets border on this hermitage,\n\nAnd to see the banished Sita and to see us, much I fear,  \nCrowds of rustics oft will trespass on thy calm devotions here,\n\nFar from towns and peopled hamlets, grant us, _rishi_ , in thy grace,  \nSome wild spot where hid in jungle we may pass these years in peace."\n\n"Twenty miles from this Prayagya," spake the _rishi_ pond\'ring well,  \n"Is a lonely hill and jungle where some ancient hermits dwell,\n\nChitra-kuta, Peak of Beauty, where the forest creatures stray,  \nAnd in every bush and thicket herds of lightsome monkeys play,\n\nMen who view its towering summit are on lofty thoughts inclined.  \nEarthly pride nor earthly passions cloud their pure and peaceful mind,\n\nHoary-headed ancient hermits, hundred autumns who have done,  \nBy their faith and lofty penance heaven\'s eternal bliss have won,\n\nHoly is the fair seclusion for thy purpose suited well,  \nOr if still thy heart inclineth, here in peace and comfort dwell!"\n\nSpake the _rishi_ Bharad-vaja, and with every courteous rite,  \nCheered his guests with varied converse till the silent hours of night,\n\nFourth night of the princes\' exile in Prayaga\'s hermitage,  \nPassed the brothers and fair Sita honoured by Prayaga\'s Sacre.\n\n## VII\n\n## CROSSING THE JUMNA--VALMIKI\'S HERMITAGE\n\nMorning dawned, and faithful Sita with the brothers held her way,  \nWhere the dark and eddying, waters of the sacred Jumna stray,\n\nPondering by the rapid river long the thoughtful brothers stood,  \nThen with stalwart arms and axes felled the sturdy jungle wood,\n\n_\n\nUsira_ of strongest fibre, slender bamboo smooth and plain,  \n_Jambu_ branches intertwining, with the bent and twisting cane,\n\nAnd a mighty raft constructed, and with creepers scented sweet,  \nLakshman for the gentle Sita made a soft and pleasant seat.\n\nThen the rustic bark was floated, framed with skill of woodman\'s craft,  \nBy her loving lord supported Sita stepped upon the raft,\n\nAnd her raiments and apparel Rama by his consort laid,  \nAnd the axes and the deerskins, bow and dart and shining blade.\n\nThen with stalwart arms the brothers plied the bending bamboo oar,  \nAnd the strong raft gaily bounding left for Jumna\'s southern shore.\n\n"Goddess of the glorious Jumna!" so the pious Sita prayed,  \n"Peaceful be my husband\'s exile in the forest\'s darksome shade,\n\nMay he safely reach Ayodhya, and a thousand fattened kine,  \nHundred jars of sweet libation, mighty Jumna, shall be thine,\n\nGrant that from the woods returning he may see his home again,  \nGrant that honoured by his kinsmen he may rule his loving men!\n\nOn her breast her arms she folded while the princes plied the oar,  \nAnd the bright bark bravely bounding reached the wooded southern shore.\n\nAnd the wanderers from Ayodhya on the river\'s margin stood,  \nWhere the unknown realm extended mantled by unending wood,\n\nGallant Lakshman with his weapons went before the path to clear,  \nSoft-eyed Sita followed gently, Rama followed in the rear.\n\nOft from tree and darksome jungle, Lakshman ever true and brave,  \nPlucked the fruit or smiling blossom and to gentle Sita gave,\n\nOft to Rama turned his consort, pleased and curious evermore,  \nAsked the name of tree or creeper, fruit or flower unseen before.\n\nStill with brotherlv affection Lakshman brought each dewy spray,  \nBud or blossom of wild beauty from the woodland bright and gay,\n\nStill with eager joy and pleasure Sita turned her eye once more,  \nWhere the tuneful swans and _saras_ flocked on Jumna\'s sandy shore.\n\nTwo miles thus they walked and wandered and the belt of forest passed,  \nSlew the wild deer of the jungle, spread on leaves their rich repast,\n\nPeacocks flew around them gaily, monkeys leaped on branches bent,  \nFifth night of their endless wanderings in the forest thus they spent.\n\n"Wake, my love, and list the warblings and the voices of the wood,"  \nThus spake Rama when the morning on the eastern mountains stood,\n\nSita woke and gallant Lakshman, and they sipped the sacred wave,  \nTo the hill of Chitra-kuta held their way serene and brave.\n\n"Mark, my love," so Rama uttered, "every bush and tree and flower,  \nTinged by radiant light of morning sparkles in a golden shower,\n\nMark the flaming flower of _Kinsuk_ and the _Vilwa_ in its pride,  \nLuscious fruits in wild profusion ample store of food provide,\n\nMark the honeycombs suspended from each tall and stately tree,  \nHow from every virgin blossom steals her store the faithless bee!\n\nOft the lone and startled wild cock sounds its clarion full and clear,  \nAnd from flowering fragrant forests peacocks send the answering cheer,\n\nOft the elephant of jungle ranges in this darksome wood,  \nFor yon peak is Chitra-kuta loved by saints and hermits good,\n\nOft the chanted songs of hermits echo through its sacred grove,  \nPeaceful on its shady uplands, Sita, we shall live and rove!"\n\nGently thus the princes wandered through the fair and woodland scene,  \nFruits and blossoms lit the branches, feathered songsters filled the green,\n\nAnchorites and ancient hermits lived in every sylvan grove,  \nAnd a sweet and sacred stillness filled the woods with peace and love!\n\nGently thus the princes wandered to the holy hermitage,  \nWhere in lofty contemplation lived the mighty Saint and Sage,\n\nHeaven inspired thy song, Valmiki! Ancient Bard of ancient day,  \nDeeds of virtue and of valour live in thy madying lay!\n\nAnd the Bard received the princes with a father\'s greetings kind,  \nBade them live in Chitra-kuta with a pure and peaceful mind,\n\nTo the true and faithful Lakshman, Rama then his purpose said,  \nAnd of leaf and forest timber Lakshman soon a cottage made.\n\n"So our sacred _Sastras_ sanction," thus the righteous Rama spake,  \n"Holy offering we should render when our dwelling-home we make,\n\nSlay the black buck, gallant Lakshman, and a sacrifice prepare,  \nFor the moment is auspicious and the day is bright and fair."\n\nLakshman slew a mighty black-buck, with the antlered trophy came,  \nPlaced the carcass consecrated by the altar\'s blazing flame,\n\nRadiant round the mighty offering tongues of red fire curling shone,  \nAnd the buck was duly roasted and the tender meat was done.  \nPure from bath, with sacred _mantra_ Rama did the holy rite,  \nAnd invoked the bright Immortals for to bless the dwelling site,\n\nTo the kindly VISWA-DEVAS, and to RUDRA fierce and strong,  \nAnd to VISHNU Lord of Creatures, Rama raised the sacred song.\n\nRighteous rite was duly rendered for the forest-dwelling made,  \nAnd with true and deep devotion was the sacred _mantra_ prayed,\n\nAnd the worship of the Bright Ones purified each earthly stain,  \nPure-souled Rama raised the altar and the _chaitya\'s_ sacred fane.\n\nEvening spread its holy stillness, bush and tree its magic felt,  \nAs the Gods in BRAHMA\'S mansions, exiles in their cottage dwelt,\n\nIn the woods of Chitra-kuta where the Malyavati flows,  \nSixth day of their weary wand\'rings ended in a sweet repose.\n\n## VIII\n\n## TALE OF THE HERMIT\'S SON\n\nWise Sumantra chariot-driver came from Ganga\'s sacred wave,  \nAnd unto Ayodhya\'s monarch, banished Rama\'s message gave,\n\nDasa-ratha\'s heart was shadowed by the deepening shade of night,  \nAs the darkness of the eclipse glooms the sun\'s meridian light!\n\nOn the sixth night,-when his Rama slept in Chitra-kuta\'s bower,-  \nMemory of an ancient sorrow flung on him its fatal power,\n\nOf an ancient crime and anguish, unforgotten, dark and dread,  \nThrough the lapse of years and seasons casting back its death-like shade!\n\nAnd the gloom of midnight deepened, Dasa-ratha sinking fast,  \nTo Kausalya sad and sorrowing spake his memories of the past:\n\n"Deeds we do in life, Kausalya, be they bitter, be they sweet,  \nBring their fruit and retribution, rich reward or suffering meet.\n\nHeedless child is he, Kausalya, in his fate who doth not scan  \nRetribution of his _karma_ , sequence of a mighty plan!\n\nOft in madness and in folly we destroy the mango grove,  \nPlant the gorgeous gay _palasa_ for the red flower that we love,\n\nFruitless as the red _palasa_ is the _karma_ I have sown,  \nAnd my barren lifetime withers through the deed which is my own!\n\nListen to my tale, Kausalya, in my days of youth renowned,  \nI was called a _sabda-bedhi_ , archer prince who shot by sound,\n\nI could hit the unseen target, by the sound my aim could tell,--  \nBlindly drinks a child the poison, blindly in my pride I fell!\n\nI was then my father\'s Regent, thou a maid to me unknown,  \nHunting by the fair Sarayu in my car I drove alone,\n\nBuffalo or jungle tusker might frequent the river\'s brink,  \nNimble deer or watchful tiger stealing for his nightly drink,\n\nStalking with a hunter\'s patience, loitering in the forests drear,  \nSound of something in the water struck my keen and listening ear,\n\nIn the dark I stood and listened, some wild beast the water drunk,  \n\'Tis some elephant, I pondered, lifting water with its trunk.\n\nI was called a _sabda-bedhi_ , archer prince who shot by sound,  \nOn the unseen fancied tusker dealt a sure and deadly wound,\n\nAh! too deadly was my arrow and like hissing cobra fell,  \nOn my startled car and bosom smote a voice of human wail,\n\nDying voice of lamentation rose upon the midnight high,  \nTill my weapons fell in tremor and a darkness dimmed my eye!\n\nHastening with a nameless terror soon I reached Sarayu\'s shore,  \nSaw a boy with hermit\'s tresses, and his pitcher lay before,\n\nWeltering in a pool of red blood, lying on a gory bed,  \nFeebly raised his voice the hermit, and in dying accents said:\n\n\'What offence, O mighty monarch, all-unknowing have I done,  \nThat with quick and kingly justice slayest thus a hermit\'s son?\n\nOld and feeble are my parents, sightless by the will of fate,  \nThirsty in their humble cottage for their duteous boy they wait,\n\nAnd thy shaft that kills me, monarch, bids my ancient parents die.  \nHelpless, friendless, they will perish, in their anguish deep and high!\n\nSacred lore and lifelong penance change not mortal\'s earthly state,  \nWherefore else they sit unconscious when their son is doomed by fate.\n\nOr if conscious of my danger, could they dying breath recall,  \nCan the tall tree save the sapling doomed by woodman\'s axe to fall?\n\nHasten to my parents, monarch, soothe their sorrow and their ire,  \nFor the tears of good and righteous wither like the forest fire,\n\nShort the pathway to the _asram_ , soon the cottage thou shalt see,  \nSoothe their anger by entreaty, ask their grace and pardon free!\n\nBut before thou goest, monarch, take, O take thy torturing dart,  \nFor it rankles in my bosom with a cruel burning smart,\n\nAnd it eats into my young life as the river\'s rolling tide  \nBy the rains of summer swollen eats into its yielding side.\'\n\nWrithing in his pain and anguish thus the wounded hermit cried,  \nAnd I drew the fatal arrow, and the holy hermit died!\n\nDarkly fell the thickening shadows, stars their feeble radiance lent,  \nAs I filled the hermit\'s pitcher, to his sightless parents went,\n\nDarkly fell the moonless midnight, deeper gloom my bosom rent,  \nAs with faint and falt\'ring footsteps to the hermits slow I went.\n\nLike two birds bereft of plumage, void of strength, deprived of flight,  \nWere the stricken ancient hermits, friendless, helpless, void of sight,\n\nLisping in their feeble accents still they whispered of their child.  \nOf the stainless boy whose red blood Dasa-ratha\'s hands defiled!\n\nAnd the father heard my footsteps, spake in accents soft and kind:  \n\'Come, my son, to waiting parents, wherefore dost thou stay behind,\n\nSporting in the rippling water didst thou midnight\'s hour beguile,  \nBut thy faint and thirsting mother anxious waits for thee the while,\n\nRath my heedless word or utterance caused thy boyish bosom smart,  \nBut a feeble father\'s failings may not wound thy filial heart,\n\nHelp of helpless, sight of sightless, and thy parents\' life and joy,  \nWherefore art thou mute and voiceless, speak, my brave and beauteous boy!\'\n\nThus the sightless father welcomed cruel slayer of his son,  \nAnd an anguish tore my bosom for the action I had done.\n\nScarce upon the sonless parents could I lift my aching eye,  \nScarce in faint and faltering accents to the father make reply,\n\nFor a tremor shook my person and my spirit sank in dread.  \nStraining all my utmost prowess, thus in quavering voice I said:\n\n\'Not thy son, O holy hermit, but a Khsatra warrior born,  \nDasa-ratha stands before thee by a cruel anguish torn,\n\nFor I came to slay the tusker by Sarayu\'s wooded brink,  \nBuffalo or deer of jungle stealing for his midnight drink,\n\nAnd I heard a distant gurgle, some wild beast the water drunk,--  \nSo I thought,--some jungle tusker lifting water with its trunk,\n\nAnd I sent my fatal arrow on the unknown, unseen prey,  \nSpeeding to the spot I witnessed,-there a dying hermit lay!\n\nFrom his pierced and quivering bosom then the cruel dart I drew,  \nAnd he sorrowed for his parents as his spirit heavenward flew,\n\nThus unconscious, holy father, I have slayed thy stainless son,  \nSpeak my penance, or in mercy pardon deed unknowing done!\'\n\nSlow and sadly by their bidding to the fatal spot I led,  \nLong and loud bewailed the parents by the cold unconscious dead,\n\nAnd with hymns and holy water they performed the funeral rite,  \nThen with tears that burnt and withered, spake the hermit in his might:\n\n_\n\n\'Sorrow for a son beloved is a father\'s direst woe,  \nSorrow for a son beloved, Dasa-ratha, thou shalt know!\n\nSee the parents weep and perish, grieving for a slaughtered son,  \nThou shalt weep and thou shalt perish for a loved and righteous son!\n\nDistant is the expiation,---but in fulness of the time,  \nDasa-ratha\'s death in anguish cleanses Dasa-ratha\'s crime!\'\n\n_\n\nSpake the old and sightless prophet; then he made the funeral pyre,  \nAnd the father and the mother perished in the lighted fire,\n\nYears have gone and many seasons, and in fulness of the time,  \nComes the fruit of pride and folly and the harvest of my crime!\n\nRama eldest born and dearest, Lakshman true and faithful son,  \nAh! forgive a dying father and a cruel action done,\n\nQueen Kaikeyi, thou hast heedless brought on Raghu\'s race this stain,  \nBanished are the guiltless children and thy lord and king is slain!\n\nLay thy hands on mine, Kausalya, wipe thy unavailing tear,  \nSpeak a wife\'s consoling accents to a dying husband\'s ear,\n\nLay thy hands on mine, Sumitra, vision falls my closing eyes,  \nAnd for bravo and banished Rama wings my spirit to the skies!\n\nHushed and silent passed the midnight, feebly still the monarch sighed,  \nBlessed Kausalya and Sumitra, blest his banished sons, and died.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book IV: The Meeting of the Princes](rama04.htm)\n\n'
