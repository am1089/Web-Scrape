Venkataramanan, [1921], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. i\n\n### PREFACE.\n\nThe main object of this publication is to present, in simple English, some of\nthe works of Sri Sankaracharya in which he tried to expound, in a popular\nstyle, the philosophy of the non-dualistic Vedanta of which he was the well-\nknown founder. With this view the present translation has been rendered free\nof technical words and phrases, and, in some instances, literal and technical\naccuracy has been purposely sacrificed in order to make the translation\nreadable and comprehensible by itself independently of the text. It is however\nhoped that the juxtaposition of the Samskrit text and the English translation\nwill serve the double object of enabling the student of Samskrit to understand\nthe text better and to correct, by a reference to the text, any defect of\nexpression in the translation as an inevitable result of the attempt to garb\nit in a popular style. To those that have had no training in metaphysics or\ndialectics and have neither the leisure nor the capacity to read the original\nstandard works of Sankara,--mostly elaborate commentaries on the Vedanta\naphorisms, the Bhagavad-gita and the Upanishads--a publication of this kind\nshould be specially helpful for a proper understanding of the broad outline of\nSankara\'s philosophy of non-dualism. The main feature of that philosophy, as\nwill be apparent from a study of the following pages, may be summed up very\nbriefly as follows.\n\np. ii\n\n[paragraph continues] _Sams ara_ or phenomenal existence, whose mar factor is\nthe bondage of births and deaths it succession, is unreal and is the result of\nillusion.--the ignorance by which the only and absolute reality, the Supreme\nSelf, is mistaken for the unreal world, in the same way as a rope may be\nmistaken for a serpent in the dusk of the evening. Both bondage and liberation\nare thus illusory, for, since there is no real bondage at all, how can there\nbe a liberation from it? Yet, liberation or _moksha_ is relatively spoken of\nand can only result from a thorough knowledge of the reality behind and beyond\nand underneath and within the unreal. Sankara emphasises the fact that such\nknowledge is not a mere theoretical one which can be gathered from books or\nlectures, but is of the nature of direct realisation or actual experience. The\nsole source of this knowledge is a clear and accurate understanding of the\nVedic text "That thou art," but, however much one may analyse its meaning by\nmeans of his own reason or with the aid of commentaries, the direct\nrealisation of the self cannot take place unless the Vedic text in question\nreaches the student through the mouth of a spiritual teacher (the _guru_ ). It\nis then, and only then, that the disciple realises in a flash, as it were, "I\nam Brahman," the individual soul is seen, at all times and in all conditions,\nto be identical with the Supreme Self, and the knowledge springs up that all\nthis is indeed the Self and there is naught but the Self. This is the highest\ngoal of spiritual endeavour, the _moksha_ or liberation of the\n\np. iii\n\n[paragraph continues] Vedanta philosophy. Further detail would be out of place\nin a short preface of this kind, but the translator feels bound to call\nattention to one very prominent teaching of Sankara which will be evident from\na perusal of the present publication,--namely, that devotion to a personal God\n( _Saguna-Brahman_ ) is not inconsistent with the true Vedanta philosophy,\nbut, on the other hand, spiritual perfection or liberation is impossible\nwithout the grace of God attainable by devotion and the grace of the Master (\n_guru_ ) who alone can reveal the true nature of the Self to the ardent\naspirant for the Absolute that is beyond all word and thought.\n\nThe Translator.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Contents](wos02.htm)\n\n'
