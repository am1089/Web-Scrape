Or this is not so, on account of the difference (of place).\n\nThe two secret names do not apply quite equally to the two persons mentioned,\nbecause they are connected with different places in the vidya. For the clause,\n'Its secret name is ahar,' the text exhibits in connexion with the person in\nthe solar orb, while the clause, 'Its secret name is aham,' occurs in\nconnexion with the person in the eye. Now the pronoun 'its' always refers to\nsomething mentioned close by; we therefore conclude that the text teaches each\nsecret name as belonging to one special abode of Brahman only. How then can\nboth names be valid for both?--But, an objection is raised, the person within\nthe orb of the sun and the person within the eye are one only; for the text\nteaches them both to be abodes of the one true Brahman!--True, we reply; but\nas each secret name is taught only with reference to the one Brahman as\nconditioned by a particular state, the name applies to Brahman only in so far\nas it is in that state. We on our part also illustrate the case by a\ncomparison. The teacher always remains the teacher; yet those kinds of\nservices which the pupil has to do to the teacher when sitting have not to be\n\np. 218\n\ndone when he stands; and vice versa.--The comparison, on the other hand,\ninstituted by the purvapakshin is ill chosen, since the duties of the disciple\ntowards his teacher depend on the latter's character as teacher, and that is\nnot changed by his being either in the village or the forest.--Hence the two\nsecret names have to be held apart.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 22](sbe38165.htm)\n\n"
