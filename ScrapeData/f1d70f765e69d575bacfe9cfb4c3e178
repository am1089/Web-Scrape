Every year it is deposited in her\naccount at the bank in Calcutta. This year the offering was made as usual, but\nit has not yet been sent to the bank, being kept meanwhile in an iron safe, in\na corner of the little dressing-room attached to our bedroom.\n\nEvery year my husband takes the money to the bank himself. This year he has\nnot yet had an opportunity of going to town. How could I fail to see the hand\nof Providence in this? The money has been held up because the country wants it\n--who could have the power to take it away from her to the bank? And how can I\nhave the power to refuse to take the money? The goddess revelling in\ndestruction holds out her blood-cup crying: "Give me drink. I am thirsty." I\nwill give her my own heart\'s blood with that five thousand rupees. Mother, the\nloser of that money will scarcely feel the loss, but me you will utterly ruin!\n\nMany a time, in the old days, have I inwardly called the Senior Rani a thief,\nfor I charged her with wheedling money out of my trusting husband. After her\nhusband\'s death, she often used to make away with things belonging to the\nestate for her own use. This I used to point out to my husband, but he\nremained silent. I would get angry and say: "If you feel generous, make gifts\nby all means, but why allow yourself to be robbed?" Providence must have\nsmiled, then, at these complaints of mine, for tonight I am on the way to rob\nmy husband\'s safe of my sister-in-law\'s money. My husband\'s custom was to let\nhis keys remain in his pockets when he took off his clothes for the night,\nleaving them in the dressing-room. I picked out the key of the safe and opened\nit. The slight sound it made seemed to wake the whole world! A sudden chill\nturned my hands and feet icy cold, and I shivered all over.\n\nThere was a drawer inside the safe. On opening this I found the money, not in\ncurrency notes, but in gold rolled up in paper. I had no time to count out\nwhat I wanted. There were twenty rolls, all of which I took and tied up in a\ncorner of my _sari_.\n\nWhat a weight it was. The burden of the theft crushed my heart to the dust.\nPerhaps notes would have made it seem less like thieving, but this was all\ngold.\n\nAfter I had stolen into my room like a thief, it felt like my own room no\nlonger. All the most precious rights which I had over it vanished at the touch\nof my theft. I began to mutter to myself, as though telling _mantrams: Bande\nMataram, Bande Mataram_ , my Country, my golden Country, all this gold is for\nyou, for none else!\n\nBut in the night the mind is weak. I came back into the bedroom where my\nhusband was asleep, closing my eyes as I passed through, and went off to the\nopen terrace beyond, on which I lay prone, clasping to my breast the end of\nthe _sari_ tied over the gold. And each one of the rolls gave me a shock of\npain.\n\nThe silent night stood there with forefinger upraised. I could not think of my\nhouse as separate from my country: I had robbed my house, I had robbed my\ncountry. For this sin my house had ceased to be mine, my country also was\nestranged from me. Had I died begging for my country, even unsuccessfully,\nthat would have been worship, acceptable to the gods. But theft is never\nworship--how then can I offer this gold? Ah me! I am doomed to death myself,\nmust I desecrate my country with my impious touch? The way to put the money\nback is closed to me. I have not the strength to return to the room, take\nagain that key, open once more that safe--I should swoon on the threshold of\nmy husband\'s door. The only road left now is the road in front. Neither have I\nthe strength deliberately to sit down and count the coins. Let them remain\nbehind their coverings: I cannot calculate.\n\nThere was no mist in the winter sky. The stars were shining brightly. If,\nthought I to myself, as I lay out there, I had to steal these stars one by\none, like golden coins, for my country-- these stars so carefully stored up in\nthe bosom of the darkness-- then the sky would be blinded, the night widowed\nfor ever, and my theft would rob the whole world. But was not also this very\nthing I had done a robbing of the whole world--not only of money, but of\ntrust, of righteousness?\n\nI spent the night lying on the terrace. When at last it was morning, and I was\nsure that my husband had risen and left the room, then only with my shawl\npulled over my head, could I retrace my steps towards the bedroom.\n\nMy sister-in-law was about, with her brass pot, watering her plants. When she\nsaw me passing in the distance she cried: "Have you heard the news, Chota\nRani?"\n\nI stopped in silence, all in a tremor. It seemed to me that the rolls of\nsovereigns were bulging through the shawl. I feared they would burst and\nscatter in a ringing shower, exposing to all the servants of the house the\nthief who had made herself destitute by robbing her own wealth.\n\n"Your band of robbers," she went on, "have sent an anonymous message\nthreatening to loot the treasury."\n\nI remained as silent as a thief.\n\n"I was advising Brother Nikhil to seek your protection," she continued\nbanteringly. "Call off your minions, Robber Queen! We will offer sacrifices to\nyour _Bande Mataram_ if you will but save us. What doings there are these\ndays!--but for the Lord\'s sake, spare our house at least from burglary."\n\nI hastened into my room without reply. I had put my foot on quicksand, and\ncould not now withdraw it. Struggling would only send me down deeper.\n\nIf only the time would arrive when I could hand over the money to Sandip! I\ncould bear it no longer, its weight was breaking through my very ribs.\n\nIt was still early when I got word that Sandip was awaiting me. Today I had no\nthought of adornment. Wrapped as I was in my shawl, I went off to the outer\napartments. As I entered the sitting-room I saw Sandip and Amulya there,\ntogether. All my dignity, all my honour, seemed to run tingling through my\nbody from head to foot and vanish into the ground. I should have to lay bare a\nwoman\'s uttermost shame in sight of this boy! Could they have been discussing\nmy deed in their meeting place? Had any vestige of a veil of decency been left\nfor me?\n\nWe women shall never understand men. When they are bent on making a road for\nsome achievement, they think nothing of breaking the heart of the world into\npieces to pave it for the progress of their chariot. When they are mad with\nthe intoxication of creating, they rejoice in destroying the creation of the\nCreator. This heart-breaking shame of mine will not attract even a glance from\ntheir eyes. They have no feeling for life itself--all their eagerness is for\ntheir object. What am I to them but a meadow flower in the path of a torrent\nin flood?\n\nWhat good will this extinction of me be to Sandip? Only five thousand rupees?\nWas not I good for something more than only five thousand rupees? Yes, indeed!\nDid I not learn that from Sandip himself, and was I not able in the light of\nthis knowledge to despise all else in my world? I was the giver of light, of\nlife, of _Shakti_ , of immortality--in that belief, in that joy, I had burst\nall my bounds and come into the open. Had anyone then fulfilled for me that\njoy, I should have lived in my death. I should have lost nothing in the loss\nof my all.\n\nDo they want to tell me now that all this was false? The psalm of my praise\nwhich was sung so devotedly, did it bring me down from my heaven, not to make\nheaven of earth, but only to level heaven itself with the dust?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XVI](hw36.htm)\n\n'
