Even as some of the havis (offering-material) may be spilled\nbefore it is offered, so also (part) of the victim is here spilled in that\nthey let loose the sprinkled (horse) before it is slain. When he offers the\nStokiyas (oblations of drops), he offers that (horse) as a complete offering\n1\\--so as to make good any spilling 2; for unspilled is any (part) of the\noffered (material) that is spilled. A thousand (oblations of drops) he offers\nfor the obtainment of the heavenly world, for the heavenly world is equal in\nextent to a thousand.\n\n13:1:3:22\\. Concerning this they say, 'Were he to offer measured (a specified\nnumber of oblations), he would gain for himself something limited:' he offers\nunspecified (oblations) for the obtainment of the unlimited. And indeed Pra\n_g_ apati spake, 'Verily, upon the oblations of drops I establish the A _s_\nvamedha, and by it, when established, I pass upward from hence.'\n\n13:1:3:33\\. [He offers, with Va _g_. S. XXII, 6,] 'To Agni, hail!'--to Agni he\nthus offers it (the horse 3);--'to Soma, hail!'--to Soma he thus offers\nit;--'to the joy of the waters, hail!'--to the waters he thus offers it;--'to\nSavit _ri_ , hail!'--to Savit _ri_\n\np. 281\n\nhe thus offers it;--'to Vayu, hail!'--to Vayu (the wind) he thus offers\nit;--'to Vish _n_ u, hail!'--to Vish _n_ u he thus offers it to;--'Indra,\nhail!'--to Indra he thus offers it;--'to B _ri_ haspati, hail!'--to B _ri_\nhaspati he thus offers it;--'to Mitra, hail!'--to Mitra he thus offers\nit;--'to Varu _n_ a, hail!'--to Varu _n_ a he thus offers it:--so many,\ndoubtless, are all the gods: it is to them he offers it. He offers them\nstraight away 1 for the obtainment of the heavenly world, for straight away,\nas it were, is the heavenly world.\n\n13:1:3:44\\. But, verily, he who offers the oblations straight away, would be\nliable to fall (pass) right away 2: he turns back again 3, and establishes\nhimself in this (terrestrial) world. And this 4 indeed he (Pra _g_ apati) has\ndeclared to be the perfection of the sacrifice, so as to prevent falling away\n(spilling), for unspilled is what is spilled of the offered (material).\n\n13:1:3:55\\. And even as some of the offering-material may be spilled before it\nis offered, so also (part) of the\n\np. 282\n\nvictim is here spilled in that they let loose the sprinkled (horse) before it\nis slaughtered. When he offers (the oblations relating to) the Forms 1 (rupa),\nhe offers that (horse) as one that is wholly offered, so as to make good any\nspilling; for unspilled is what is spilled of the offered (material). With (Va\n_g_. S. XXII, 7-8 2),'To the Hi\xe1\xb9\x85-call, hail! to the (horse) consecrated by\nHi\xe1\xb9\x85, hail! . . .'\n\np. 283\n\n[paragraph continues] (he offers them); for these are the forms (qualities) of\nthe horse: it is them he now obtains.\n\n13:1:3:66\\. Concerning this they say, 'The Forms are no offering: they should\nnot be offered.' But, indeed, they also say, 'Therein assuredly the horse-\nsacrifice becomes complete that he performs (the oblations relating to) the\nForms: they should certainly be offered.' And, indeed, one puts that\n(Sacrificer) out of his resting-place, and raises a rival for him when one\noffers for him oblations elsewhere than in the fire 1, where there is no\nresting-place.\n\n13:1:3:77\\. Prior to the (first) oblation to Savit _ri_  2, he (the Adhvaryu)\noffers, once only, (the oblations relating to) the Forms 3 in the \xc3\x82havaniya,\nwhilst going rapidly over (the formulas): he thus offers the oblations at his\n(the Sacrificer's) resting-place, and raises no rival for him. He offers at\neach opening of sacrifice 4, for the continuity and uninterrupted performance\nof the sacrifice.\n\n13:1:3:88\\. Concerning this they say, 'Were he to offer\n\np. 284\n\nat each opening of sacrifice, he would be deprived of his cattle, and would\nbecome poorer.' They should be performed once only: thus he is not deprived of\nhis cattle, and does not become poorer. Forty-eight (oblations) he\noffers;--the _G_ agati consists of forty-eight syllables, and cattle are of\n_G_ agata (movable) nature: by means of the _G_ agati he (the Adhvaryu) thus\nwins cattle for him (the Sacrificer). One additional (oblation) he offers,\nwhence one man is apt to thrive amongst (many) creatures (or subjects).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[280:1](sbe44076.htm#fr_701) Cf.

XX, 2, 3-5, he offers either a\nthousand oblations, or as many as he can offer till the dripping of the water\nfrom the horse has ceased. For every ten oblations he uses the formulas here\ngiven, after which he begins again from the beginning. The 'straight on'\napparently means that he is neither to break the order of the deities, nor to\noffer more than one oblation at a time to the same deity.\n\n[281:2](sbe44076.htm#fr_705) That is, he would die; 'praitity artha _h_ ,'\nComm. The St. Petersburg Dict., on the other hand, takes 'i _s_ vara _h_\npradagha _h_ ' in the sense of 'liable to fall down headlong' (absturzen).\n\n[281:3](sbe44076.htm#fr_706) That is, by commencing the ten oblations again\nfrom the beginning.\n\n[281:4](sbe44076.htm#fr_707) Viz. repetition of performance,--etam eva _k_ a\nsa pra _g_ apatir av _ri_ ttimatta _m_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya sa _m_ sthitim (uva _k_\na). On repetitions in the chanting of stotras, see III, 2, 5, 8; cf. also\n[XII, 2, 3, 13](sbe44051.htm#12:2:3:13).\n\n[282:1](sbe44076.htm#fr_708) These forty-nine oblations performed after the\nletting loose of the horse, are called Prakramas (i.e. steps, or movements);\ncf. [XIII, 4, 3, 4](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:4); Katy. XX, 3, 3.--Harisvamin\nremarks, a _s_ varupa _n_ a _m_ hi\xe1\xb9\x85karadina _m_ nishkrama _n_ atmika (!)\nrupakhya ahutaya u _k_ yante, ta evatra prakrama iti vakshyante.\n\n[282:2](sbe44076.htm#fr_709) These (rather pedantic) formulas, all of them\nending in 'svaha,' occupy two Ka _n_ _d_ ikas of the Sa _m_ hita, consisting\nof 24 and 25 formulas respectively:--1. To the hi\xe1\xb9\x85kara, svaha! 2. To the one\nconsecrated by 'hi\xe1\xb9\x85,' hail! 3. To the whinnying one, hail! 4. To the neighing,\nhail! 5. To the snorting one, hail! 6.

To the working one, hail! 49. To the wrought one, hail!\n\n[283:1](sbe44076.htm#fr_710) According to Katy. XX, 3, 3, the Prakramas are to\nbe offered in the Dakshi _n_ agni; but our Brahma _n_ a, whilst mentioning, at\n[XIII, 4, 3, 4](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:4), both that fire, and the horse's\nfootprint as optional places of offering, there as well as here decides in\nfavour of the \xc3\x82havaniya; whence Harisvamin remarks:--anyatragner iti\nanvaharyapa _k_ ane va _s_ vapade va parilikhite vakshyama _n_\nakalpantaraninda.\n\n[283:2](sbe44076.htm#fr_711) See [XIII, 1, 4, 2](sbe44077.htm#13:1:4:2).\n\n[283:3](sbe44076.htm#fr_712) That is to say, without repeating them, when he\nhas come to the end, as he did in the case of the 'oblations of drops.' Nor\nare they to be repeated day after day throughout the year, as some of the\nother offerings and rites are.\n\n[283:4](sbe44076.htm#fr_713) Viz., according to Harisvamin, at (the beginning\nof) the diksha _n_ iya, praya _n_ iya, atithya, pravargya; the upasads,\nagnishomiya, sutya, avabh _ri_ tha, udayaniya, and udavasaniya offerings (ish\n_t_ i). This view is, however, rejected by the author.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 1, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe44077.htm)\n\n"
