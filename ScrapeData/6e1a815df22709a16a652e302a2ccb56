And on account of the suitability of the attributes.\n\nThe attributes also which the text ascribes to the bhuman suit the highest\nSelf only. So immortality ('The Bhuman is immortal,' VII, 24, 1); not being\nbased on something else ('it rests in its own greatness'); being the Self of\nall ('the bhuman is below,' &c., 'it is all this'); being that which produces\nall ('from the Self there springs breath,' &c.). All these attributes can be\nreconciled with the highest Self only.--The Purvapakshin has pointed to the\ntext which declares the 'I' to be the Self of all (VII, 25, 1); but what that\ntext really teaches is meditation on Brahman under the aspect of the 'I.' This\nappears from the introductory clause 'Now follows the instruction with regard\nto the I.' That of the 'I,' i.e. the individual Self, also the highest Self is\nthe true Self, scripture declares in several places, so e.g. in the text about\nthe inward Ruler (B _ri_. Up. III, 7). As therefore the individual soul finds\nits completion in the highest Self only, the word 'I' also extends in its\nconnotation up to the highest Self; and the instruction about the 'I' which is\ngiven in the text has thus for\n\np. 308\n\nits object meditation on the highest Self in so far as having the individual\nSelf for its body. As the highest Self has all beings for its body and thus is\nthe Self of all, it is the Self of the individual soul also; and this the text\ndeclares in the passage beginning 'Now follows the instruction about the\nSelf,' and ending 'Self is all this.' In order to prove this the text declares\nthat everything originates from the highest Self which forms the Self of the\nindividual soul also, viz. in the passage 'From the Self of him who sees this,\nperceives this, knows this, there springs breath,' &c.--that means: breath and\nall other beings spring from the highest Self which abides within the Self of\nthe meditating devotee as its inner ruler. Hence, the text means to intimate,\nmeditation should be performed on the 'I,' in order thus firmly to establish\nthe cognition that the highest Self has the 'I,' i.e. the individual soul for\nits body.\n\nIt is thus an established conclusion that the bhuman is the highest Self. Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'fulness.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 9. The Imperishable is Brahman, on account of its supporting that which\nis the end of ether](sbe48108.htm)\n\n"
