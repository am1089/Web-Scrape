The Upanishad (treats of) the Garbhalambhana, the Pu _m_ savana, and the\nAnavalobhana (i.e. the ceremonies for securing the conception of a child, the\nmale gender of the child, and for preventing disturbances which could endanger\nthe embryo).\n\n2 2. If he does not study (that Upanishad), he\n\np. 180\n\nshould in the third month of her pregnancy, under (the Nakshatra) Tishya, give\nto eat (to the wife), after she has fasted, in curds from a cow which has a\ncalf of the same colour (with herself), two beans and one barley grain for\neach handful of curds.\n\n3\\. To his question, 'What dost thou drink? What dost thou drink?' she should\nthrice reply, 'Generation of a male child! Generation of a male child!'\n\n4\\. Thus three handfuls (of curds).\n\n5 5. He then inserts into her right nostril, in the shadow of a round\napartment, (the sap of) an herb which is not faded,\n\n6 6. According to some (teachers) with the Pra _g_ avat and _G_ ivaputra\nhymns.\n\n7\\. Having sacrificed of a mess of cooked food sacred to Pra _g_ apati, he\nshould touch the place of her heart with the (verse,) 'What is hidden, O thou\nwhose hair is well parted, in thy heart, in Pra _g_ apati, that I know; such\nis my belief. May I not fall into distress that comes from sons.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[179:1](sbe29112.htm#fr_436) 13, 1. Naraya _n_ a evidently did not know the\nUpanishad here referred to; he states that it belongs to another _S_ akha.\nComp. Professor Max Muller's note on B _ri_ had \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka VI, 4, 24\n(S.B.E., vol. xv, p. 222).\n\n[179:2](sbe29112.htm#fr_437) 'He should give her the two beans as a symbol of\nthe testicles, and the barley grain as a symbol of the penis.' Naraya _n_ a.\n\n[180:5](sbe29112.htm#fr_438) Naraya _n_ a (comp. also the Prayogaratna, folio\n40; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayaniya-G _ri_ hya-Pari _s_ ish _t_ a I, 25; NIS. Chambers 667)\nseparates this rite from the ceremony described in Sutras 2-4. He says that\nSutras 2-4\xc2\x97as indeed is evidently the case\xc2\x97refer to the Pu _m_ savana, and in\nSutra 5 begins the Anavalobhana (comp. garbharaksha _n_ a, Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kh. I, 21). To\nme it seems more probable that the text describes one continuous ceremony.\nThere is no difficulty in supposing that of the Anavalobhana, though it is\nmentioned in Sutra 1, no description is given in the following Sutras, the\nsame being the case undoubtedly with regard to the Garbhalambhana, of which a\ndescription is found in the \xc3\x82 _s_ v.-Pari _s_ ish _t_ a I, 25.\n\n[180:6](sbe29112.htm#fr_439) Two texts commencing a te garbho yonim etu and\nAgnir etu prathama _h_.
