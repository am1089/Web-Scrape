Bestow thou  \nfood upon this Sacrificer.  \n3 Thou, Steed, art meet for laud and veneration; swift, fit for  \nsacrifice art thou, O Courser.  \nIn concert with the Gods and Vasus Agni Omniscient waft  \nthee a contented bearer!  \n4 Pleased with much Sacred Grass which we have scattered  \nwide spread upon the earth, a pleasant carpet,  \nJoined with the Gods may Aditi, accordant, bestowing bliss  \naward it happy fortune.  \n5 May these your Doors divine that wear all colours, auspicious,  \nwith uplifted leaves unfolding,  \nLofty and closely fitted and sonorous, rich in adornment,  \noffer easy passage.  \n6 Your two Dawns rich in gold and varied colour, travelling  \non \xc2\x92twixt Varuna and Mitra,  \nAcquainted with the face of sacrifices, I settle here within  \nthe home of Order.  \n7 Your two chief Hotars have I pleased, bright-coloured, borne  \non one car, Gods who behold all creatures,  \nThose who prepare your rules and ordinances and make you  \nsee the light by their direction.  \n8 Bharati with \xc3\x82dityas love our worship! Sarasvati with  \nRudras be our helper,  \nAnd Ida in accord, invoked with Vasus! Goddesses, place  \nour rite among the Immortals.\n\np. 248\n\n9 The God-devoted son Tvashtar produces: from Tvashtar  \nsprings to life your fleet-foot Courser.  \nTvashtar gave being to this All about us. Priest, worship  \nhere the mighty work's achiever.  \n10 Let the Steed seek his home, and balmed with butter go of  \nhimself unto the Gods in season.  \nTo the Gods\xc2\x92 world Vanaspati, well-knowing, bear our oblations  \nwhich the fire has tasted!  \n11 Thou, waxing by Prajapati's strong fervour, born quickly,  \nguardest sacrifice, O Agni.  \nWith consecrated offering go, preceding, and let the Sadhyas,  \nGods, eat our oblation.  \n12 What time, first springing into life, thou neighedst, proceeding  \nfrom the sea or cloudy vapour,  \nLimbs of the deer hadst thou, and eagle pinions. O Steed,  \nthy birth is high and must be lauded.  \n13 This Steed, bestowed by Yama, Trita harnessed, and Indra  \nwas the first to mount and ride him.  \nHis bridle the Gandharva grasped. O Vasus, from out the  \nSun ye fashioned forth the Courser.  \n14 Yama art thou, O Horse; thou art \xc3\x82ditya; Trita art thou  \nby secret operation.  \nFrom Soma thou art thoroughly divided. They say there  \nare three bonds in heaven that hold thee.  \n15 Three bonds, they say, thou hast in heaven to bind thee,  \nthree in the waters, three within the ocean.\n\np. 249\n\nTo me thou seemest Varuna, O Courser, there where they  \nsay is thy sublimest birthplace.  \n16 Here, Courser, are the places where they groomed thee;  \nhere are the traces of thy hooves as winner.  \nHere have I seen the auspicious reins that guide thee, which  \nthose who guard the holy Law keep safely.  \n17 Thyself from far I recognized in spirit, a Bird that from  \nbelow flew through the heaven.  \nI saw thy head still soaring, striving upward by paths unsoiled  \nby dust, pleasant to travel.  \n18 Here I beheld thy form matchless in beauty, eager to win  \nthee food at the Cow's station.  \nWhene\xc2\x92er a man brings thee to thine enjoyment, thou  \nswallowest the herbs, most greedy eater.  \n19 After thee, Courser, come the car, the bridegroom, the kine  \ncome after, and the charm of maidens.  \nFull companies have followed for thy friendship: the pattern  \nof thy vigour Gods have followed.  \n20 His horns are golden and his feet are iron. Less fleet than  \nhe, though swift as thought, was Indra.  \nThe Gods came only to the oblation-banquet of him who  \nmounted first of all the Courser.  \n21 Symmetrical in flank, with rounded haunches, mettled like  \nheroes, the celestial Coursers  \nPut forth their strength like swans in lengthened order when  \nthey, the Steeds, have reached the heavenly causeway.  \n22 A body formed for flight hast thou, O Charger; swift as the  \nwind in motion is thy spirit.  \nThy horns are spread abroad in all directions; they move  \nwith restless beat in wildernesses.\n\np. 250\n\n23 The strong Steed hath come forward to the slaughter, pondering  \nwith a mind directed God-ward.  \nThe goat who is his kin is led before him: the sages and the  \nsingers follow after.  \n21 The Steed is come unto the noblest mansion, is come unto  \nhis Father and his Mother.  \nThis day shall he approach the Gods, most welcome: then  \nhe declares good gifts to him who worships.  \n25 Thou in the house of man this day enkindled worshippest  \nGods, a God, O Jatavedas.  \nWealthy in friends! observant, bring them hither. Thou  \nart a sapient envoy, full of wisdom.  \n26 Tanunapat, fair-tongued, with sweet mead balming the  \npaths and ways of Order, make them pleasant.  \nConvey our sacrifice to heaven, exalting with holy thoughts  \nour hymns of praise and worship.  \n27 With sacrifice to these we with laudations will honour holy  \nNarasamsa's greatness\xc2\x97  \nTo these the pure, most wise, the thought-inspirers, Gods  \nwho enjoy both sorts of our oblations.  \n28 Invoked, deserving laud and adoration, O Agni, come accordant  \nwith the Vasus.  \nThou art, O vigorous One, the Gods\xc2\x92 Invoker, so, best of  \nSacrificers, bring them quickly.  \n29 By rule the Sacred Grass is scattered eastward, a robe to  \nclothe the earth when dawns are breaking.  \nWidely it spreads around and far extended, fair for the Gods  \nand bringing peace and freedom.  \n30 Let the expansive Doors be widely opened, like wives who  \ndeck their beauty for their husbands.  \nLofty, celestial, all-impelling Portals, admit the Gods and  \ngive them easy access.\n\np. 251\n\n31 Pouring sweet dews, let holy Night and Morning, each  \nclose to each, be seated at their station\xc2\x97  \nLofty, celestial Dames, with gold to deck them, assuming  \nall their fair and radiant beauty.  \n32 Come the two chief celestial sweet-voiced Hotars, arranging  \nsacrifice for man to worship,  \nAs singers who inspire us in assemblies, showing the eastward  \nlight with their direction!  \n33 Let Bharati come quickly to our worship, and Ida showing  \nlike a human being.  \nSo let Sarasvati and both her fellows, deft Goddesses, on  \nthis fair grass be seated.  \n34 Hotar more skilled in sacrifice, bring hither with speed today  \nGod Tvashtar, thou who knowest,  \nEven him who framed these two, the Earth and Heaven,  \nthe Parents, with their forms, and every creature.  \n35 Send to our offerings which thyself thou balmest the  \nCompanies of Gods in ordered season.  \nAgni, Vanaspati, the Immolator sweeten our offered gift  \nwith mead and butter.  \n36 Agni as soon as he was born made ready the sacrifice and  \nwas the Gods\xc2\x92 preceder.  \nMay the Gods eat our offering consecrated according to the  \ntrue Priest's voice and guidance.  \n37 Thou, making light where no light was, and form, O men!  \nwhere form was not,  \nWast born together with the Dawns.  \n38 The warrior's look is like a thunderous rain-cloud's when,  \narmed with mail, he seeks the lap of battle.  \nBe thou victorious with unwounded body: so let the thickness  \nof thine armour save thee.  \n39 With Bow let us win kine, with Bow the battle, with Bow  \nbe victors in our hot encounters.  \nThe Bow brings grief and sorrow to the foeman: armed with  \nthe Bow may we subdue all regions.\n\np. 252\n\n40 Close to his ear, as fain to speak, She presses, holding her  \nwell-loved Friend in her embraces.  \nStrained on the Bow, She whispers like a woman\xc2\x97this  \nBow-string that preserves us in the combat.  \n41 These, meeting like a woman and her lover, bear,  \nmother-like, their child upon their bosom.  \nMay the two Bow-ends, starting swift asunder scatter, in  \nunison, the foes who hate us.  \n42 With many a son, father of many daughters, He clangs and  \nclashes as he goes to battle.  \nSlung on the back, pouring his brood, the Quiver vanquishes  \nall opposing bauds and armies.  \n43 Upstanding in the Car the skilful Charioteer guides his  \nstrong Horses on whitherso\xc2\x92er he will.  \nSee and admire the strength of those controlling Reins which  \nfrom behind declare the will of him who drives  \n44 Horses whose hoofs rain dust are neighing loudly, yoked to  \nthe Chariots, showing forth their vigour.  \nWith their forefeet descending on the foemen, they, never  \nflinching, trample and destroy them.  \n45 Car-bearer is the name of his oblation, whereon are laid his  \nWeapons and his Armour.  \nSo let us here, each day that passes, honour the helpful Car  \nwith hearts exceeding joyful.  \n46 In sweet association lived the fathers who gave us life,  \nprofound and strong in trouble,  \nUnwearied, armed with shafts and wondrous weapons, free,  \nreal heroes, conquerors of armies.\n\np. 253\n\n47 The Brahmans, and the Fathers meet for Soma draughts,  \nand, graciously inclined, unequalled Heaven and Earth.  \nGuard us from evil, Pushan! guard us strengtheners of  \nLaw! let not the evil-wisher master us.  \n48 Her tooth a deer, dressed in an eagle's feathers, bound with  \ncow-hide, launched forth, She flieth onward.  \nThere where the heroes speed hither and thither, there may  \nthe arrows shelter and protect us.  \n49 Avoid as thou whose flight is straight, and let our bodies  \nbe as stone.  \nMay Soma kindly speak to us, and Aditi protect us well.  \n59 He lays his blows upon their backs, He deals his strokes  \nupon their thighs.  \nThou Whip who urgest horses, drive sagacious chargers in  \nthe fray.  \n51 It compasses the arm with serpent windings, fending away  \nthe friction of the bowstring:  \nSo may the Brace, well skilled in all its duties, guard manfully  \nthe man from every quarter.  \n52 Lord of the Wood, be firm and strong in body: be, bearing  \nus, a brave victorious hero.  \nShow forth thy strength, compact with straps of leather,  \nand let thy rider win all spoils of battle.  \n53 Its mighty strength was borrowed from the heaven and earth  \nits conquering force was brought from sovrans of the wood.  \nHonour with holy gifts the Car like Indra's bolt, the Car  \nbound round with straps, the vigour of the floods.  \n54 Thou bolt of Indra, Vanguard of the Maruts, close knit to  \nVaruna and Child of Mitra,\xc2\x97  \nAs such, accepting gifts which here we offer, receive, O Godlike  \nChariot, these oblations.  \n55 Send forth thy voice aloud through earth and heaven, and  \nlet the world in all its breadth regard thee;  \nO Drum, accordant with the Gods and Indra, drive thou  \nafar, yea, very far, our foemen.\n\np. 254\n\n56 Thunder out strength and fill us fall of vigour: yea, thunder  \nforth and drive away all dangers.  \nDrive hence, O War-drum, drive away misfortune: thou art  \nthe Fist of Indra: show thy firmness.  \n57 Drive hither those, and these again bring hither: the  \nWar-drum speaks aloud as battle's signal.  \nOur heroes, winged with horses, come together. Let our  \ncar-warriors, Indra, be triumphant.  \n58 The black-necked victim belongs to Agni; the ewe to  \nSarasvati; the brown victim is Soma's; the dusky Pushan's;  \nthe white-backed is Brihaspati's; the dappled belongs to  \nthe All-Gods; the red to Indra; the spotted to the Maruts;  \nthe strong-bodied to Indra-Agni; one with white marks below  \nto Savitar; to Varuna a black ram with one white foot  \n59 To Agni Anikavan is sacrificed a red-marked ox; two with  \nwhite spots below are for Savitar; two with silvery navels  \nfor Pushan; two yellow hornless he-goats for the All-Gods;  \na spotted one for the Maruts; the black-faced he-goat is  \nAgni's; the ewe is Sarasvati's; the ram is Varuna's.  \n60 To Agni of the Gayatri, of the Trivrit hymn and of the  \nRathantara Saman is to be offered a rice-cake on eight  \npotsherds; to Indra of the Trishtup, the Pa\xc3\xb1chadasa  \nhymn and the Brihat Saman one on eleven potsherds; to  \nthe All-Gods of the Jagati, the Seventeenfold hymn  \nand the Vairupa Saman, one on twelve potsherds; to  \nMitra-Varuna of the Anushtup, the Ekavimsa hymn, and  \nthe Vairaja Saman, a mess of curdled milk; to Brihaspati  \nof the Pankti metre, the Trinava hymn, and the Sakvara  \nSaman, an oblation of rice boded in milk; to Savitar of  \nthe Ushnih, the Thirty-threefold hymn, and the Raivata  \nSaman, a rice-cake on eight potsherds; a mess of boiled  \nrice is to be made for Prajapati; the same for Vishnu's  \nConsort Aditi; to Agni Vaisvanara is to be offered a  \nrice-cake on twelve potsherds, and to Anumati one on eight.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XXX](wyvbk30.htm)\n\n"
