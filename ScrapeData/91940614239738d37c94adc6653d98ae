I desire to know severally, O mighty-armed, the truth of Sannyasa, O\nHrishikesha, as also of Tyaga, O slayer of Keshi. 1\n\np. 365\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n2\\. The renunciation of Kamya actions, the sages understand as. Sannyasa: the\nwise declare the abandonment of the fruits of all works as Tyaga. 2\n\n3\\. Some philosophers declare that all action should be relinquished as an\nevil, whilst others (say) that the work of Yajna, gift and austerity should\nnot be relinquished.\n\np. 366\n\n4\\. Hear from Me the final truth about relinquishment, O best of the Bharatas.\nFor relinquishment has been declared to be of three kinds, O tiger among men.\n\n5\\. The work of Yajna, gift and austerity should not be relinquished, but it\nshould indeed be performed; (for) Yajna, gift and austerity are purifying to\nthe wise.\n\np. 367\n\n6\\. But even these works, O Partha, should be performed, leaving attachment\nand the fruits;--such is My best and certain conviction.\n\n7\\. But the renunciation of obligatory action is not proper. Abandonment of\nthe same from delusion is declared to be Tamasika. 7\n\np. 368\n\n8\\. He who from fear of bodily trouble relinquishes action, because it is\npainful, thus performing a Rajasika relinquishment, he obtains not the fruit\nthereof. 8\n\n9\\. When obligatory work is performed, O Arjuna, only because it ought to be\ndone, leaving attachment and fruit, such relinquishment is regarded as\nSattvika.\n\np. 369\n\n10\\. The relinquisher endued with Sattva and a steady understanding and with\nhis doubts dispelled, hates not a disagreeable work nor is attached to an\nagreeable one.\n\n11\\. Actions cannot be entirely relinquished by an embodied being, but he who\nrelinquishes the fruits of action is called a relinquisher.\n\np. 370\n\n12\\. The threefold fruit of action--disagreeable, agreeable and mixed,--\naccrues to non-relinquishers after death, but never to relinquishers.\n\n13\\. Learn from Me, O mighty-armed, these five causes for the accomplishment\nof all works as declared in the wisdom which is the end of all action: 13\n\np. 371\n\n14\\. The body, the agent, the various senses, the different functions of a\nmanifold kind, and the presiding divinity, the fifth of these; 14\n\n15\\. Whatever action a man performs by his body, speech and mind--whether\nright or the reverse--these five are its causes.\n\np. 372\n\n16\\. Such being the case, he who through a non-purified understanding looks\nupon his Self, the Absolute, as the agent, he of perverted mind sees not.\n\n17\\. He who is free from the notion of egoism, whose intelligence is not\naffected (by good or evil), though he kills these people, he kills not, nor is\nbound (by the action); 17\n\np. 373\n\n18\\. Knowledge, the known and the knower form the threefold cause of action.\nThe instrument, the object and the agent are the threefold basis of action. 18\n\n19\\. Knowledge, action and agent are declared in the Sankhya philosophy to be\n\np. 374\n\nof three kinds only, from the distinction of Gunas: hear them also duly. 19\n\n20\\. That by which the one indestructible Substance is seen in all beings,\ninseparate in the separated, know that knowledge to be Sattvika. 20\n\np. 375\n\n21\\. But that knowledge which sees in all beings various entities of distinct\nkinds as different from one another, know thou that knowledge as Rajasika. 21\n\n22\\. Whilst that which is confined to one single effect as if it were the\nwhole, without reason, without foundation in truth, and trivial,--that is\ndeclared to be Tamasika. 22\n\np. 376\n\n23\\. An ordained action done without love or hatred by one not desirous of the\nfruit and free from attachment, is declared to be Sattvika.\n\n24\\. But the action which is performed desiring desires, or with self-conceit\nand with much effort, is declared to be Rajasika.\n\np. 377\n\n25\\. That action is declared to be Tamasika which is undertaken through\ndelusion, without heed to the consequence, loss (of power and wealth), injury\n(to others) and (one\'s own) ability.\n\n26\\. An agent who is free from attachment, non-egotistic, endued with\nfortitude and enthusiasm and unaffected in success or failure, is called\nSattvika.\n\n27\\. He who is passionate, desirous of the fruits of action, greedy,\nmalignant, impure, easily elated or dejected, such an agent is called\nRajasika. 27\n\np. 378\n\n28\\. Unsteady, vulgar, arrogant, dishonest, malicious, indolent, desponding\nand procrastinating, such an agent is called Tamasika.\n\n29\\. Hear thou the triple distinction of intellect and fortitude, according to\nthe Gunas, as I declare them exhaustively and severally, O Dhananjaya. 29\n\np. 379\n\n30\\. That which knows the paths of work and renunciation, right and wrong\naction, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation, that intellect, O\nPartha, is Sattvika. 30\n\n31\\. That which has a distorted apprehension of Dharma and its opposite and\nalso of right action and its opposite, that intellect, O Partha, is Rajasika.\n\np. 380\n\n32\\. That which enveloped in darkness regards Adharma as Dharma and views all\nthings in a perverted light, that intellect, O Partha, is Tamasika.\n\n33\\. The fortitude by which the functions of the mind, the Prana and the\nsenses, O Partha, are regulated, that fortitude, unswerving through Yoga, is\nSattvika.\n\np. 381\n\n34\\. But the fortitude by which one regulates (one\'s mind) to Dharma, desire\nand wealth, desirous of the fruit of each from attachment, that fortitude, O\nPartha, is Rajasika.\n\n35\\. That by which a stupid man does not give up sleep, fear, grief,\ndespondency and also overweening conceit, that fortitude, O Partha, is\nTamasika. 35\n\np. 382\n\n36\\. And now hear from Me, O bull of the Bharatas, of the threefold happiness.\nThat happiness which one learns to enjoy by habit, and by which one comes to\nthe end of pain;\n\n37\\. That which is like poison at first, but like nectar at the end; that\nhappiness is declared to be Sattvika, born of the translucence of intellect\ndue to Self-realisation.\n\np. 383\n\n38\\. That which arises from the contact of object with sense, at first like\nnectar, but at the end like poison, that happiness is declared to be Rajasika.\n38\n\n39\\. That happiness which begins and results in self-delusion arising from\nsleep, indolence and miscomprehension, that is declared to be Tamasika.\n\np. 384\n\n40\\. There is no entity on earth, or again in heaven among the Devas, that is\ndevoid of these three Gunas, born of Prakriti.\n\n41\\. Of Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, as also of Sudras, O scorcher\nof foes, the duties are distributed according to the Gunas born of their own\nnature. 41\n\np. 385\n\n42\\. The control of the mind and the senses, austerity, purity, forbearance,\nand also uprightness, knowledge, realisation, belief in a hereafter,--these\nare the duties of the Brahmanas, born of (their own) nature.\n\n43\\. Prowess, boldness, fortitude, dexterity, and also not flying from battle,\ngenerosity and sovereignty are the duties of the Kshatriyas, born of (their\nown) nature.\n\np. 386\n\n44\\. Agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade are the duties of the Vaishyas,\nborn of (their own) nature; and action consisting of service is the duty of\nthe Sudras, born of (their own) nature.\n\n45\\. Devoted each to his own duty, man attains the highest perfection. How\nengaged in his own duty, he attains perfection, that hear. 45\n\np. 387\n\n46\\. From whom is the evolution of all beings, by whom all this is pervaded,\nworshipping Him with his own duty, a man attains perfection. 46\n\n47\\. Better is one\'s own Dharma, (though) imperfect, than the Dharma of\nanother well-performed. He who does the duty ordained by his own nature incurs\nno evil. 47\n\np. 388\n\n48\\. One should not relinquish, O son of Kunti, the duty to which one is born,\nthough it is attended with evil; for, all undertakings are enveloped by evil,\nas fire by smoke. 48\n\np. 389\n\n49\\. He whose intellect is unattached everywhere, who has subdued his heart,\nwhose desires have fled, he attains by renunciation to the supreme perfection,\nconsisting of freedom from action. 49\n\n50\\. Learn from Me in brief, O son of Kunti, how reaching such perfection, he\nattains to Brahman, that supreme consummation of knowledge.\n\np. 390\n\n51\\. Endued with a pure intellect, subduing the body and the senses with\nfortitude, relinquishing sound and such other sense-objects, abandoning\nattraction and hatred; 51\n\n52\\. Resorting to a sequestered spot, eating but little, body, speech and mind\n\np. 391\n\ncontrolled, ever engaged in meditation and concentration, possessed of\ndispassion; 52\n\n53\\. Forsaking egoism, power, pride, lust, wrath and property, freed from the\nnotion of "mine," and tranquil, he is fit for becoming Brahman. 53\n\np. 392\n\n54\\. Brahman-become, tranquil-minded, he neither grieves nor desires; the same\nto all beings, he attains to supreme devotion unto Me. 54\n\n55\\. By devotion he knows Me in\n\np. 393\n\nreality, what and who I am; then having known Me in reality, he forthwith\nenters into Me.\n\n56\\. Even doing all actions always, taking refuge in Me,--by My grace he\nattains to the eternal, immutable State.\n\n57\\. Resigning mentally all deeds to Me, having Me as the highest goal,\nresorting to Buddhi-Yoga do thou ever fix thy mind on Me.\n\np. 394\n\n58\\. Fixing thy mind on Me, thou shalt, by My grace, overcome all obstacles;\nbut if from self-conceit thou wilt not hear Me, thou shalt perish.\n\n59\\. If filled with self-conceit thou thinkest, "I will not fight," vain is\nthis thy resolve; thy Prakriti will constrain thee. 59\n\np. 395\n\n60\\. Fettered, O son of Kunti, by thy own Karma, born of thy own nature, what\nthou, from delusion, desirest not to do, thou shalt have to do in spite of\nthyself.\n\n61\\. The Lord, O Arjuna, dwells in the hearts of all beings, causing all\nbeings, by His Maya, to revolve, (as if) mounted on a machine. 61\n\n62\\. Take refuge in Him with all thy heart, O Bharata; by His grace shalt thou\n\np. 396\n\nattain supreme peace (and) the eternal abode.\n\n63\\. Thus has wisdom more profound than all profundities, been declared to.\nthee by Me; reflecting over it fully, act as thou likest. 63\n\n64\\. Hear thou again My supreme word, the profoundest of all; because thou art\ndearly beloved of Me, therefore will I speak what is good to thee. 64\n\np. 397\n\n65\\. Occupy thy mind with Me, be devoted to Me, sacrifice to Me, bow down to\nMe. Thou shalt reach Myself; truly do I promise unto thee, (for) thou art dear\nto Me. 65\n\n66\\. Relinquishing all Dharmas take\n\np. 398\n\nrefuge in Me alone; I will liberate thee from all sins; grieve not. 66\n\np. 399\n\n67\\. This is never to be spoken by thee to one who is devoid of austerities or\ndevotion, nor to one who does not render service, nor to one who cavils at Me.\n67\n\n68\\. He who with supreme devotion to Me will teach this deeply profound\nphilosophy to My devotees, shall doubtless come to Me alone. 68\n\np. 400\n\n69\\. Nor among men is there any who does dearer service to Me, nor shall there\nbe another on earth dearer to Me, than he. 69\n\n70\\. And he who will study this sacred dialogue of ours, by him shall I have\nbeen worshipped by the Yajna of knowledge; such is My conviction. 70\n\np. 401\n\n71\\. And even that man who hears this, full of Shraddha and free from malice,\nhe too, liberated, shall attain to the happy worlds of those of righteous\ndeeds. 71\n\n72\\. Has this been heard by thee, Partha, with an attentive mind? Has the\ndelusion of thy ignorance been destroyed, O Dhananjaya?\n\np. 402\n\nArjuna said:\n\n73\\. Destroyed is my delusion, and I have gained my memory through Thy grace,\nO Achyuta. I am firm; my doubts are gone. I will do Thy word. 73\n\np. 403\n\nSanjaya said:\n\n74\\. Thus have I heard this wonderful dialogue between Vasudeva and the high-\nsouled Partha, causing my hair to stand on end.\n\n75\\. Through the grace of Vyasa have I heard this supreme and most profound\nYoga, direct from Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, Himself declaring it. 75\n\np. 404\n\n76\\. O King, as I remember and remember this wonderful and holy dialogue\nbetween Keshava and Arjuna, I rejoice again and again. 76\n\n77\\. And as I remember and remember that most wonderful Form of Hari, great is\nmy wonder, O King; and I rejoice again and again. 77\n\np. 405\n\n78\\. Wherever is Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, wherever is Partha, the wielder of\nthe bow, there are prosperity, victory, expansion, and sound policy: such is\nmy conviction. 78\n\nThus in the Srimad-Bhagavad-Gita, the Essence of the Upanishads, the Science\nof the Brahman, the Scripture of Yoga, the Dialogue between Sri Krishna and\nArjuna, ends the Eighteenth Chapter designated:\n\nThe Way of Liberation in Renunciation.\n\n_Here the Bhagavad-Gita ends_.\n\nOm! Peace! Peace! Peace be to all!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[364:1](sbg23.htm#fr_356) _Sanny asa and Tyaga_ both mean renunciation. Keshi\n--was an Asura.\n\n[365:2](sbg23.htm#fr_357) _K amya_--which are accompanied with a desire for\nfruits.\n\n[367:7](sbg23.htm#fr_358) Since it is purifying in the case of the ignorant.\n\n[368:8](sbg23.htm#fr_359) _Fruit_ , _i.e._ , Moksha, which comes out of the\nrenunciation of all actions accompanied with wisdom.\n\n[370:13](sbg23.htm#fr_360) _Wisdom:_ Sankhya,--literally, in which all the\nthings that are to be known are expounded, therefore, the highest wisdom.\n\n[371:14](sbg23.htm#fr_361) _Presiding divinity:_ Each of the senses has its\ngod who presides over it, and by whose aid it discharges its own functions;\n_e.g._ , the Aditya (Sun) is the presiding divinity of the eye, by whose aid\nit sees and acts; and so on with the other senses.\n\n[372:17](sbg23.htm#fr_362) He whose self-consciousness, by the force of long,\nstrenuous, and properly-trained self-concentration, is ever identified with\nBrahman, and not with the five causes of action as mentioned in Sloka 14,--he\nwhose self-consciousness never mistakes itself for the body, mind and the\nlike, even when performing p. 373 physical acts,--he is ever free from the\ntaint of action.\n\n[373:18](sbg23.htm#fr_363) _Basis_ --because the threefold action inheres in\nthese three.\n\n[374:19](sbg23.htm#fr_364) _S ankhya:_ the Science of the Gunas by Kapila.\nThough there is a conflict in the matter of supreme Truth--the oneness or non-\nduality of Brahman--between the Vedanta and the Sankhya, yet the Sankhya view\nis given here, because it is an authority on the science of Gunas.\n\n_Duly_ --described according to the Science, according to reason.\n\n[374:20](sbg23.htm#fr_365) _Inseparate:_ undifferentiated; permeating all.\n\n[375:21](sbg23.htm#fr_366) _Entities:_ Souls.\n\n_Different from one another:_ Different in different bodies.\n\n[375:22](sbg23.htm#fr_367) _One single effect:_ such as the body,--thinking it\nto be the Self.\n\n[377:27](sbg23.htm#fr_368) _Elated or dejected_ --at the success or failure of\nthe action in which he is engaged.\n\n[378:29](sbg23.htm#fr_369) _Dhananjaya:_ the conqueror of wealth--human and\ndivine, earthly and celestial; an epithet of Arjuna.\n\n[379:30](sbg23.htm#fr_370) _Fear . . . liberation_ --the cause of fear and the\ncause of fearlessness; similarly, the cause of bondage and the cause of\nliberation.\n\n[381:35](sbg23.htm#fr_371) _Does not give up sleep &c._,--is inordinately\naddicted to sleep &c., regarding these to be only proper.\n\n[383:38](sbg23.htm#fr_372) _At the end like poison_ --because it leads to\ndeterioration in strength, vigour, complexion, wisdom, intellect, wealth and\nenergy.\n\n[384:41](sbg23.htm#fr_373) According to the Karma or habits and tendencies\nformed by desire, action and association in the past life manifesting\nthemselves in the present as effects. Or, nature (Svabhava) may here mean the\nMaya made up of the three Gunas, the Prakriti of the Lord.\n\n[386:45](sbg23.htm#fr_374) _Own_ --according to his nature.\n\nThe Apastamba Dharma-Shastra says: "Men of several castes and orders, each\ndevoted to his respective duties, reap the fruits of their actions after\ndeath, and then by the residual Karma attain to births in superior countries,\ncastes and families, possessed of comparatively superior Dharma, span of life,\nlearning, conduct, wealth, happiness and intelligence."\n\n[387:46](sbg23.htm#fr_375) The highest worship to the Lord consists in the\nclosest approach to Him. The veil of Maya comprising Karma or habits,\ntendencies and actions prevents a man from nearing the Lord, _i.e._ ,\nrealising his own Self. By working out one\'s Karma alone, according to the law\nof one\'s being, can this veil be rent and the end accomplished.\n\n[387:47](sbg23.htm#fr_376) p. 388 As a poisonous substance does not injure the\nworm born in that substance, so he who does his Svadharma incurs no evil.\n\n[388:48](sbg23.htm#fr_377) _Duty etc._ --this need not mean caste duty.\n\n_All undertakings:_ one\'s own as well as others\' duties.\n\nThe greatest evil is bondage and this endures so long as one lives in the\nrealm of the Gunas, except in the case of a freed soul. All action is\ncomprised in one or the other of the Gunas. All action therefore involves the\nevil of bondage.\n\n[389:49](sbg23.htm#fr_378) _He attains . . . renunciation_ --This may also be\ninterpreted to mean: he attains the supreme state in which he remains as the\nactionless Self, by his renunciation of all actions, for which he is prepared\nby his right knowledge.\n\n[390:51](sbg23.htm#fr_379) _Pure:_ free from doubt and misconception, being\nmerged in Brahman through the elimination of all alien attributes ascribed to\nIt.\n\n_Relinquishing sound &c._--abandoning all superfluous luxuries, all objects\nexcept those only which are necessary for the bare maintenance of the body,\nand laying aside attraction and hatred even for those objects.\n\n[391:52](sbg23.htm#fr_380) _Eating but little_ --as conducive to the serenity\nof thought by keeping off languor, sleepiness and the like.\n\n_Meditation_ --upon the nature of the Self.\n\n_Concentration_ --one-pointedness of thought, on one feature of the Self.\n\n_Dispassion_ --for the seen and the unseen.\n\n[391:53](sbg23.htm#fr_381) _Power_ --that power which is combined with passion\nand desire.\n\n_Property:_ Though a man who is free from all passions of the mind and the\nsenses, may own so much of external belongings as is necessary for bodily\nsustenance and for the observance of his religious duties (Dharma), yet this\nthe aspirant abandons, even if this comes of itself, because he does not\nregard p. 392 the bodily life as his; thus he becomes a Paramahamsa\nParivrajaka, a Sannyasin of the highest order.\n\n[392:54](sbg23.htm#fr_382) _Brahman-become:_ not that he is yet freed and\nbecome the Absolute, but is firmly grounded in the knowledge that he is\nBrahman. His attainment of freedom is described in the next verse.\n\n_Supreme devotion:_ the devotion stated in VII. 17.\n\n[394:59](sbg23.htm#fr_383) _Thy Prakriti:_ Thy nature as a Kshatriya.\n\n[395:61](sbg23.htm#fr_384) See commentary to IX. 10.\n\n_Arjuna_ means \'white,\' and here it signifies--\'O pure-hearted one.\'\n\n[396:63](sbg23.htm#fr_385) It: the Shastra, the teaching as declared above.\n\n[396:64](sbg23.htm#fr_386) Again: though more than once declared.\n\n[397:65](sbg23.htm#fr_387) _Thou shalt reach Myself:_ Thus acting,-- _i.e._ ,\nlooking upon the Lord alone as thy aim, means and end--thou shalt attain the\nHighest.\n\n_Truly do I promise unto thee_.--Have implicit faith in the declarations of\nMe, the Lord, as I pledge thee My troth.\n\n[398:66](sbg23.htm#fr_388) _All Dharmas_ --including Adharma also: all\nactions, righteous or unrighteous, since absolute freedom from the bondage of\nall action is intended to be taught here.\n\n_Take refuge in Me alone_ --knowing that there is naught else except Me, the\nSelf of all, dwelling the same in all.\n\n_Liberate thee_ --by manifesting Myself as thy own Self.\n\n_All sins:_ all bonds of Dharma and Adharma.\n\nSankara in his commentary here very strongly combats the opinion of those who\nhold that highest spiritual realisation (Jnana) and ritualistic work (Karma)\nmay go together in the same person. For Karma is possible only in the relative\nworld (Samsara), which is the outcome of ignorance; and knowledge dispels this\nignorance. So neither the conjunction of Jnana with Karma, nor Karma alone\nconduces to the absolute cessation of Samsara, but it is only the Right\nKnowledge of the Self which does so.\n\n[399:67](sbg23.htm#fr_389) _This_ --Shastra which has been taught to you.\n\n_Service_ --to the Guru;  ![](img/39900.jpg) also means,--to one who does not\nwish to hear.\n\n[399:68](sbg23.htm#fr_390) _Teach_ --in the faith that he is thus doing\nservice to the Lord, the Supreme Teacher.\n\n_Doubtless:_ or, freed from doubts.\n\n[400:69](sbg23.htm#fr_391) _He:_ who hands down the Shastra to a fit person.\n\n[400:70](sbg23.htm#fr_392) _Yajna of knowledge:_ A Yajna can be performed in\nfour ways, such as (1) Vidhi or ritual, (2). Japa, (3) Upamsu, or a prayer\nuttered, in a low voice, or (4) Manasa or prayer offered with the mind. Jnana-\nyajna or the Yajna of knowledge comes under the head of Manasa, and is\ntherefore the highest.\n\nThe study of the Gita will produce an effect equal to that of the Yajna of\nknowledge.\n\n[401:71](sbg23.htm#fr_393) _Even that man:_ much more so he who understands\nthe doctrine.\n\n[402:73](sbg23.htm#fr_394) _Memory_ --of the true nature of the Self.\n\n_Firm_ --in Thy command.\n\nThe purpose of the knowledge of the Shastras is the destruction of doubts and\ndelusions, and the recognition of the true nature of the Self. Here, the\nanswer of Arjuna conclusively shows, that that purpose has been fulfilled in\nhim.\n\nThe teaching of the Shastra is over here. The rest is only to connect it with\nthe main narrative.\n\n[403:75](sbg23.htm#fr_395) _Through . . . Vy asa:_ by obtaining from him the\nDivya-chakshu or divine vision.\n\n[404:76](sbg23.htm#fr_396) _King:_ Dhritarashtra.\n\n[404:77](sbg23.htm#fr_397) Form: Vishvarupa, the Universal Form.\n\n[405:78](sbg23.htm#fr_398) _The bow_ --called the Gandiva.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Greatness of the Gita](sbg24.htm)\n\n'
