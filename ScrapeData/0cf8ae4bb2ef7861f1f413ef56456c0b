XXIII, 5],\n'They harness the ruddy bay,\n\np. 312\n\nmoving (round the moveless: the lights shine in the heavens);'--the ruddy bay,\ndoubtless, is yonder sun: it is yonder sun he harnesses for him, for the\ngaining of the heavenly world.\n\n13:2:6:22\\. Concerning this they say, 'Surely, the sacrifice goes from him\nwhose beast, when brought up, goes elsewhere than the vedi (altar-ground).'\n[Let him, therefore, mutter Va _g_. S. XXIII, 7,] 'Singer of praise, make that\nhorse come back to us by that path!'--the singer of praise, doubtless, is Vayu\n(the wind) it is him he thereby places for him (the Sacrificer) on the other\nside, and so it does not go beyond that.\n\n13:2:6:33\\. But, indeed, fiery mettle and energy, cattle, and prosperity\ndepart from him who offers the A _s_ vamedha.\n\n13:2:6:44\\. With (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 8), 'May the Vasus anoint thee with the\nGayatra metre!' the queen consort anoints (the forepart of the unharnessed\nhorse);--ghee is fiery mettle, and the Gayatri also is fiery mettle: two kinds\nof fiery mettle he thus bestows together on him (the Sacrificer).\n\n13:2:6:55\\. With, 'May the Rudras anoint thee with the Traish _t_ ubha metre!'\nthe (king's) favourite wife anoints (the middle part):--ghee is fiery mettle,\nand the Trish _t_ ubh is energy: both fiery\n\np. 313\n\nmettle and energy he thus bestows together on him.\n\n13:2:6:66\\. With, 'May the \xc3\x82dityas anoint thee with the _G_ agata metre!' a\ndiscarded wife 1 (of the king) anoints (the hindpart);--ghee is fiery mettle,\nand the _G_ agati is cattle: both fiery mettle and cattle he thus bestows\ntogether on him.\n\n13:2:6:77\\. It is the wives 2 that anoint (the horse), for they to wit, (many)\nwives--are a form of prosperity (or social eminence): it is thus prosperity he\nconfers on him (the Sacrificer), and neither fiery spirit, nor energy, nor\ncattle, nor prosperity pass away from him.\n\n13:2:6:88\\. But even as some of the offering-material may get spilled before\nit is offered, so (part of) the victim is here spilled in that the hair of it\nwhen wetted comes off. When they (the wives) weave pearls (into the mane and\ntail) they gather up its hair. They are made of gold: the significance of this\nhas been explained. A hundred and one pearls they weave into (the hair of)\neach part 3; for man has a life of a hundred (years), and his own self (or\nbody) is the one hundred and first: in vital power, in the self, he\nestablishes himself. They weave them in (each) with (one of) the (sacred\nutterings) relating to Pra _g_ apati, 'Bu _h_! bhuva _h_! svar (earth, air,\n\np. 314\n\nheaven)!' for the horse is sacred to Pra _g_ apati: with its own deity he thus\nsupplies it. With, 'Parched grain, or parched groats?--in grain-food and in\nfood from the cow'--he takes down the remaining food 1 (from the cart) for the\nhorse: he thereby makes the (king's) people eaters of food (prosperous);--'eat\nye, gods, this food! eat thou, Pra _g_ apati, this food!' he thereby supplies\nthe people with food.\n\n13:2:6:99\\. Verily, fiery spirit and spiritual lustre pass away from him who\nperforms the A _s_ vamedha. The Hot _ri_ and the Brahman engage in a Brahmodya\n2 (theological discussion); for the Hot _ri_ relates to Agni, and the Brahman\n(priest) to B _ri_ haspati, B _ri_ haspati being the Brahman (n.): fiery\nspirit 3 and spiritual lustre he thus bestows together on him. With the\n(central) sacrificial stake between them, they discourse together; for the\nstake is the Sacrificer 4: he thus encompasses the Sacrificer on both sides\nwith fiery spirit and spiritual lustre.\n\n13:2:6:1010\\. [The Brahman asks,  Va _g_. S. XXIII, 9,] 'Who is it that\nwalketh singly?'--it is yonder sun, doubtless, that walks singly 5, and he is\nspiritual\n\np. 315\n\nlustre: spiritual lustre the two (priests) thus bestow on him.\n\n13:2:6:1111\\. 'Who is it that is born again?'--it is the moon, doubtless, that\nis born again (and -again): vitality they thus bestow on him.\n\n13:2:6:1212\\. 'What is the remedy for cold?'--the remedy for cold, doubtless,\nis Agni '(fire): fiery spirit they thus bestow on him.\n\n13:2:6:1313\\. 'And what is the great vessel?'--the great vessel, doubtless, is\nthis (terrestrial) world: on this earth he thus establishes himself.\n\n13:2:6:1414\\. [The Hot _ri_ asks the Brahman, Va _g_. S. XXIII, 11,] 'What was\nthe first conception?'--the first conception, doubtless, was the sky, rain:\nthe sky, rain, he thus secures for himself.\n\n13:2:6:1515\\. 'Who was the great bird 1?'--the great bird, doubtless, was the\nhorse:. vital power he thus secures for himself.\n\n13:2:6:1616\\. 'Who was the smooth one?'--the smooth one (pilippila),\ndoubtless, was beauty ( _s_ ri 2): beauty he thus secures for himself.\n\np. 316\n\n13:2:6:1717\\. 'Who was the tawny one?'--the two tawny ones, doubtless, are the\nday and the night [1](sbe44089.htm#fn_803): in the day and night he thus\nestablishes himself.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[311:2](sbe44088.htm#fr_796) Along with the sacrificial horse three other\nhorses are put to the chariot, with the formula Va _g_. S. XXIII, 6.\nPreviously to this, however, the Hot _ri_ recites eleven verses in praise of\nthe horse (cf. [XIII, 5, 1, 16](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:16)). Both the horses and\nthe chariot are decorated p. 312 with gold ornaments. The Adhvaryu then drives\nwith the Sacrificer to a pond of water to the east of the sacrificial ground\n(an indispensable feature in choosing the place of sacrifice), and having\ndriven into the water he makes him pronounce the formula XXIII, 7, 'When the\nwind hath entered the waters, the dear form of Indra, do thou, singer of\npraise, make that horse come back to us by that path;' whereupon they return\nto the sacrificial ground.\n\n[313:1](sbe44088.htm#fr_797) That is, a former favourite, but now neglected;\nor, according to others, one who has borne no son.\n\n[313:2](sbe44088.htm#fr_798) The fourth and lowest wife of the King the\nPalagali (cf. [XIII, 4, 1, 8](sbe44102.htm#13:4:1:8); [5, 2,\n8](sbe44107.htm#13:5:2:8)), though present at the sacrifice, does not take\npart in this ceremony, probably on account of her low-caste origin, as the\ndaughter of a messenger, or courier.\n\n[313:3](sbe44088.htm#fr_799) Viz. either the mane on both sides, and the tail,\nor the hair of the head, the neck (mane) and the tail; each of the ladies\napparently taking one of these parts.\n\n[314:1](sbe44088.htm#fr_800) Viz. the material left over after what was taken\nfor the Annahomas, [XIII, 2, 1, 1](sbe44083.htm#13:2:1:1) seqq.\n\n[314:2](sbe44088.htm#fr_801) For a similar discussion between the four\npriests, prior to the offering of the omenta, see [XIII, 5, 2,\n11](sbe44107.htm#13:5:2:11) seq.\n\n[314:3](sbe44088.htm#fr_802) 'Te _g_ as' is pre-eminently the quality assigned\nto Agni.\n\n[314:4](sbe44088.htm#fr_803) It must be remembered that the sacrificial horse\nhere represented by the stake is identified with both Pra _g_ apati and the\nSacrificer.\n\n[314:5](sbe44088.htm#fr_804) The actual replies to the questions in Va _g_. S.\nXXIII, 9 and 11, are contained in the corresponding verses ten and twelve;\nbeing given here in an expository way, with certain variations and p. 315\noccasional explanatory words (such as 'v _ri_ sh _t_ i,' rain, in [paragraph\n14](sbe44088.htm#13:2:6:14)). The answers to the first four questions are\nsupposed to be given by the Hot _ri_ , and the last four by the Brahman.\n\n[315:1](sbe44088.htm#fr_805) This is the meaning assigned here to 'vayas' by\nMahidhara; but the other meaning of 'vayas,' viz. 'youthful vigour, or age,\n(generally),' would seem to suit much better, or at least to be implied. And\nHarisvamin accordingly takes it in the sense of 'vardhakam' (old age, or long\nlife). Mahidhara, moreover, identifies the horse with the horse-sacrifice,\nwhich, in the shape of a bird, carries the Sacrificer up to heaven. On this\nnotion cp. part iv, introduction, pp. xxi-xxii.\n\n[315:2](sbe44088.htm#fr_806) Instead of ' _s_ ri _h_ ,' the answer given to\nthis question in Va _g_. S. XXIII, 12 was 'avi _h_ ' which would either mean\n'the gentle, kindly one,' or 'the sheep (f.),' but which Mahidhara (in the\nformer sense) p. 316 takes as (an epithet of) the earth which he also takes '\n_s_ ri' to mean in the above passage of the Brahma _n_ a; whilst to the \xe1\xbc\x85\xcf\x80\xce\xb1\xce\xbe\n\xce\xbb\xce\xb5\xce\xb3\xcf\x8c\xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbd 'pilippila' he assigns the meaning 'slippery' ( _k_ ikka _n_ a) as\napplying to the earth after rain (? deriving it from the root 'lip,' to smear,\nanoint). Harisvamin, on the other hand, takes 'pilippila' to be an\nonomatopoetic word, in the sense of '(glossy), beautiful,\nshining':--rupanukarana _s_ abdo\xe0\xa4\xbdya _m_ bahurupavila (? bahurupanvita)\nuddyotavati; and he adds:-- _s_ rimi _m_ tratu _h_ (? _s_ rir mantre tu) avi\n_h_ pippaloktau (?) sa tu _s_ rir eveti brahma _n_ e viv _ri_ ta _m_ , katham,\niya _m_ va avi _h_ p _ri_ thivi, sa _k_ a _s_ ri _h_ , _s_ rir va iyam iti va\n_k_ anat.
