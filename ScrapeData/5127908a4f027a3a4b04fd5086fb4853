Now, therefore, the duties of a Snataka (will be explained). 1\n\n2\\. Let him not beg from anybody except from a king and a pupil. 2\n\n3\\. But let him ask, if pressed by hunger, for some (small gift) only, a\ncultivated or uncultivated field, a cow, a goat or a sheep, (or) at the last\nextremity, for gold, grain or food. 3\n\n4\\. But the injunction (given by those who know the law) is, \'A Snataka shall\nnot be faint with hunger.\' 4\n\n5\\. Let him not dwell together with a person whose clothes are foul; 5\n\n6\\. (Let him not cohabit) with a woman during her courses,\n\n7\\. Nor with an unfit one. 7\n\n8\\. Let him not be a stay-at-home. 8\n\np. 60\n\n9\\. Let him not step over a stretched rope to which a calf (or cow) is tied. 9\n\n10\\. Let him not look at the sun when he rises or sets. 10\n\n11\\. Let him not void excrements or urine in water, 11\n\n12\\. Nor spit into it.\n\n13\\. Let him ease himself, after wrapping up his head and covering the ground\nwith grass that is not fit to be used at a sacrifice, and turning towards the\nnorth in the day-time, turning towards the south at night, sitting with his\nface towards the north in the twilight. 13\n\n14\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): \'But Snatakas shall always\nwear a lower garment and an upper one, two sacrificial threads, (shall carry)\na staff and a vessel filled with water.\' 14\n\n15\\. \'It is declared, that (a vessel becomes) pure (if cleaned) with water, or\nwith the hand, or with a stick, or with fire: Therefore he shall clean (his)\nvessel with water and with his (right) hand.\'\n\n16\\. \'For Manu, the lord of created beings, calls (this mode of cleaning)\nencircling it-with fire.\'\n\n17\\. He who is perfectly acquainted with (the rules of) purification shall sip\nwater (out of this vessel), after he has relieved the necessities of nature.\'\n\n18\\. Let him eat his food facing the east. 18\n\np. 61\n\n19\\. Silently let him swallow the entire mouthful, (introducing it into the\nmouth) with the four fingers and with the thumb; 19\n\n20\\. And let him not make a noise (while eating).\n\n21\\. Let him approach his wife in the proper season, except on the Parva days.\n21\n\n22\\. Let him not commit a crime against nature (with her).\n\n23\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): \'The ancestors of a man-who\ncommits an unnatural crime with a wedded wife, feed during that month on his\nsemen. All unnatural intercourse is against the sacred law.\'\n\n24\\. It is also declared in the Ka _th_ aka, \'(When) the women (asked) Indra,\n"May even those among us, who are soon to be mothers, (be allowed to) cohabit\nwith their husbands," he granted that wish.\'\n\n25\\. Let him not ascend a tree. 25\n\n26\\. Let him not descend into a well.\n\n27\\. Let him not blow the fire with his mouth.\n\n28\\. Let him not pass between a fire and a Brahma _n_ a, 28\n\n29\\. Nor between two fires;\n\n30\\. Nor between two Brahma _n_ as; or (he may do it) after having asked for\npermission. 30\n\n31\\. Let him not dine together with his wife. For it is declared in the Va _g_\nasaneyaka, His children will be destitute of manly vigour.\' 31\n\np. 62\n\n32\\. Let him not point out (a rainbow calling it) by (its proper) name,\n\'Indra\'s bow.\' 32\n\n33\\. Let him call it \'the jewelled bow\' (ma _n_ idhanu _h_ ).\n\n34\\. Let him avoid seats, clogs, sticks for cleaning the teeth, (and other\nimplements) made of Pala _s_ a wood. 34\n\n35\\. Let him not eat (food placed) in his lap. 35\n\n36\\. Let him not eat (food placed) on a chair. 36\n\n37\\. Let him carry a staff of bamboo, 37\n\n38\\. And (wear) two golden earrings. 38\n\n39\\. Let him not wear any visible wreath excepting a golden one; 39\n\n40\\. And let him disdain assemblies and crowds. 40\n\n41\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): \'To deny the authority of the\nVedas, to carp at the teaching of the _Ri_ shis, to waver with respect to any\n(matter of duty), that is to destroy one\'s soul.\' 41\n\n42\\. Let him not go to a sacrifice except if he is chosen (to be an\nofficiating priest. But) if he goes,. he must, on returning home, turn his\nright hand (towards the place). 42\n\n43\\. Let him not set out on a journey when the sun stands over the trees. 43\n\np. 63\n\n44\\. Let him not ascend an unsafe boat, or (any unsafe conveyance). 44\n\n45\\. Let him not cross a river, swimming. 45\n\n46\\. When he has risen in the last watch (of the night) and has recited (the\nVeda) he shall not lie down again. 46\n\n47\\. In the Muhurta sacred to Pra _g_ apati a Brahma _n_ a shall fulfil some\nsacred duties. 47\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[59:1](sbe1415.htm#fr_335) **XII**. \'Now\' marks the beginning of a new topic.\n\'Therefore,\' i.e. because the duties of a Snataka have to be taught after\nthose of a student.\n\n[59:2](sbe1415.htm#fr_336) Manu IV, 33; Gautama IX, 63.\n\n[59:3](sbe1415.htm#fr_337) Manu X, 113-114.\n\n[59:4](sbe1415.htm#fr_338) Manu IV, 34; Vish _n_ u III, 79.\n\n[59:5](sbe1415.htm#fr_339) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita, whom I have followed\nin the translation of this Sutra, thinks that it indicates the obligation of\nwearing clean clothes, see e.g. Vish _n_ u LXXI, 9. It seems to me, however,\nprobable that its real sense is, \'Let him not cohabit with a woman during her\ncourses,\' and that the next Sutra has to be read nara _g_ asvalaya., \'Nor with\none of immature age.\'\n\n[59:7](sbe1415.htm#fr_340) \'An unfit one,\' i.e.\' one of low caste\' (hina).--K\n_ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita, Probably a sick wife is meant, Gautama IX, 28.\n\n[59:8](sbe1415.htm#fr_341) Gautama IX, 53. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita gives\nbesides the above interpretation of the Sutra from Haradatta\'s Gautamiya\nMitakshara, another one, according to which it means, \'Let him not forsake his\nown family and enter another one (by adoption and so forth).\' A third p. 60\nexplanation is given by Naraya _n_ a on Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khayana G _ri_ hya-sutra IV, 12,\nII, who takes it to mean, \'Let him not go from one house to the other.\'\n\n[60:9](sbe1415.htm#fr_342) Gautama IX, 52; Vish _n_ u LXIII, 42.\n\n[60:10](sbe1415.htm#fr_343) Vish _n_ u LXXI, 17-18.\n\n[60:11](sbe1415.htm#fr_344)-12. Vish _n_ u LXXI, 35.\n\n[60:13](sbe1415.htm#fr_345) Gautama IX, 37-38, 41-43; Vish _n_ u LX, 2-3.\n\n[60:14](sbe1415.htm#fr_346) Vish _n_ u LXXI, 13-15.\n\n[60:18](sbe1415.htm#fr_347) Vish _n_ u LXVIII, 40.\n\n[61:19](sbe1415.htm#fr_348) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita thinks that this\nrule refers to the first five mouthfuls only.\n\n[61:21](sbe1415.htm#fr_349) Vish _n_ u LXIX, 1. The Parva days are the eighth,\nfourteenth, and fifteenth of each half-month.\n\n[61:25](sbe1415.htm#fr_350)-27. Gautama IX, 32.\n\n[61:28](sbe1415.htm#fr_351) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 12, 6.\n\n[61:30](sbe1415.htm#fr_352) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 12, 7-8.\n\n[61:31](sbe1415.htm#fr_353) _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a X, 5, 2, 9; Vish _n_ u\nLXVIII, 46.\n\n[62:32](sbe1415.htm#fr_354)-33. Gautama IX, 22.\n\n[62:34](sbe1415.htm#fr_355) Gautama IX, 44.\n\n[62:35](sbe1415.htm#fr_356) Vish _n_ u LXVIII, 21.\n\n[62:36](sbe1415.htm#fr_357) Gautama IX, 32.\n\n[62:37](sbe1415.htm#fr_358) Vish _n_ u LXXI, 13.\n\n[62:38](sbe1415.htm#fr_359) Vish _n_ u LXXI, 16.\n\n[62:39](sbe1415.htm#fr_360) Gautama IX, 32.\n\n[62:40](sbe1415.htm#fr_361) I read sabhasamavaya _m_ _s_ _k_ ava _g_ ayeta.\nThe corrupt readings of Bh. samavaya _s_ _k_ a _g_ aviyan and of F. samavaya\n_m_ _s_ _k_ a vakshiyanna point to this version, the sense of which agrees\nwith the parallel passages of other Sm _ri_ tis, see e.g. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 32,\n19.\n\n[62:41](sbe1415.htm#fr_362) Vish _n_ u LXXI, 83.\n\n[62:42](sbe1415.htm#fr_363) Gautama IX, 54-55, 66.\n\n[62:43](sbe1415.htm#fr_364) Vish _n_ u LXIII, 9. According to K _ri_ sh _n_\napa _n_ _d_ ita the time intended is midday.\n\n[63:44](sbe1415.htm#fr_365) Vish _n_ u LXIII, 47.\n\n[63:45](sbe1415.htm#fr_366) Vish _n_ u LXIII, 46. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_\nita omits this Sutra which is found in the majority of the MSS.\n\n[63:46](sbe1415.htm#fr_367) \xc3\x82pastamba I, II, 32, 15; Vish _n_ u XXX, 27.\n\n[63:47](sbe1415.htm#fr_368) Manu IV, 92; Vish _n_ u LX, i. The Muhurta sacred\nto Pra _g_ apati is the same as the Brahma-muhurta, and falls in the last\nwatch of the night.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIII](sbe1416.htm)\n\n'
