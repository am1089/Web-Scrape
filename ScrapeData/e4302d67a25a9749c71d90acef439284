Thou seest many stars at night in the sky, but findest them not when the\nsun rises. Canst thou say that there are no stars, then, in the heaven of day?\nSo, O man, because thou beholdest not the Almighty in the days of thy\nignorance, say not that there is no God.\n\n2\\. As one and the same material, viz. water, is called by different names by\ndifferent people--one calling it 'water,' another 'vari,' a third 'aqua,' and\nanother 'pa _n_ i'--so the one Sat- _k_ it-ananda, the Everlasting-\nIntelligent-Bliss, is invoked by some as God, by some as Allah, by some as\nHari, and by others as Brahman.\n\n3\\. Two persons were hotly disputing as to the colour of a chameleon. One\nsaid, 'The chameleon on that palm-tree is of a beautiful red colour.' The\nother, contradicting him, said, 'You are mistaken, the chameleon is not red,\nbut blue.' Not being able to settle the matter by arguments, both went to the\nperson who always lived under that tree and had watched the chameleon in all\nits phases of colour.\n\np. 99\n\n[paragraph continues] One of them said, 'Sir, is not the chameleon on that\ntree of a red colour?' The person replied, 'Yes, sir.' The other disputant\nsaid, 'What do you say? How is it? It is not red, it is blue.' That person\nagain humbly replied, 'Yes, sir.' The person knew that the chameleon is an\nanimal that constantly changes its colour; thus it was that he said 'yes' to\nboth these conflicting statements. The Sat- _k_ it-ananda likewise has various\nforms. The devotee who has seen God in one aspect only, knows Him in that\naspect alone. But he who has seen Him in His manifold aspects, is alone in a\nposition to say, 'All these forms are of one God, for God is multiform.' He\nhas forms and has no forms, and many are His forms which no one knows.\n\n4\\. Many are the names of God, and infinite the forms that lead us to know\nHim. In whatsoever name or form you desire to call Him, in that very form and\nname you will see Him.\n\n5\\. Four blind men went to see an elephant. One touched the leg of the\nelephant, and said, 'The elephant is like a pillar.' The second touched the\ntrunk, and said, The elephant is like a thick stick or club.' The third\ntouched the belly, and said, 'The elephant is like a big jar.' The fourth\ntouched the ears, and said, 'The elephant is like a winnowing basket.' Thus\nthey began to dispute amongst themselves as to the figure of the elephant. A\npasser-by seeing them thus quarrelling, said, 'What is it that you are\ndisputing about?' They told him everything, and asked him to arbitrate. That\nman said, 'None of you\n\np. 100\n\nhas seen the elephant. The elephant is not like a pillar, its legs are like\npillars. It is not like a big water-vessel, its belly is like a water-vessel.\nIt is not like a winnowing basket, its ears are like winnowing baskets. It is\nnot like a thick stick or club, but its proboscis is like that. The elephant\nis the combination of all these.' In the same manner those quarrel who have\nseen one aspect only of the Deity.\n\n6\\. As the same sugar is made into various figures of birds and beasts, so one\nsweet Mother Divine is worshipped in various climes and ages under various\nnames and forms. Different creeds are but different paths to reach the\nAlmighty.\n\n7\\. As with one gold various ornaments are made, having different forms and\nnames, so one God is worshipped in different countries and ages, and has\ndifferent forms and names. Though He may be worshipped variously, some loving\nto call him Father, others Mother, &c., yet it is one God that is being\nworshipped in all these various relations and modes.\n\n8\\. _Q_. If the God of every religion is the same, why is it then that the God\nis painted differently by different religionists? _A_. God is one, but His\naspects are different: as one master of the house is father to one, brother to\nanother, and husband to a third, and is called by these different names by\nthose different persons, so one God is described and called in various ways\naccording to the\n\np. 101\n\nparticular aspect in which He appears to His particular worshipper.\n\n9\\. In a potter's shop there are vessels of different shapes and forms--pots,\njars, dishes, plates, &c.--but all are made of one clay. So God is one, but is\nworshipped in different ages and climes under different names and aspects.\n\n10\\. God is one, but his aspects are many. One and the same fish may be made\nto taste differently, according to the different modes of preparing it, so one\nGod is enjoyed variously (i.e. in His various aspects) by His devotees.\n\n11\\. Man is like a pillow-case. The colour of one may be red, another blue,\nanother black, but all contain the same cotton So it is with man--one is\nbeautiful, one is black, another is holy, a fourth wicked; but the Divine\ndwells in them all.\n\n12\\. All waters are brooded over by Naraya _n_ a, but every kind of water is\nnot fit for drink. Similarly, though it is true that the Almighty dwells in\nevery place, yet every place is not fit to be visited by man. As one kind of\nwater may be used for washing our feet, another may serve the purpose of\nablution, and others may be drunk, and others again may not be touched at all;\nso there are different kinds of places. We may approach some, we can enter\ninto the inside of others, others we must avoid, even at a distance.\n\n13\\. It is true that God is even in the tiger, but we must not go and face the\nanimal. So it is true that God dwells\n\np. 102\n\neven in the most wicked, but it is not meet that we should associate with the\nwicked.\n\n14\\. The manifestation of the Divinity must be under-stood to be in greater\ndegree in those who are honoured, respected, and obeyed by a large following,\nthan in those who have gained no such influence.\n\n15\\. The Master said: 'Everything that exists is God.' The pupil understood it\nliterally, but not in the true spirit. While he was passing through a street,\nhe met with an elephant. The driver (mahut) shouted aloud from his high place,\n'Move away, move away!' The pupil argued in his mind, 'Why should I move away?\nI am God, so is the elephant also God. What fear has God of Himself?' Thinking\nthus he did not move. At last the elephant took him up by his trunk, and\ndashed him aside. He was severely hurt, and going back to his Master, he\nrelated the whole adventure. The Master said, 'All right, you are God. The\nelephant is God also, but God in the shape of the elephant-driver was warning\nyou also from above. Why did you not pay heed to his warnings?'\n\n18\\. God, His scripture (the Bhagavata), and His devotee are all to be\nregarded as one, i.e. in one and the same light.\n\n17\\. Every being is Naraya _n_ a. Man or animal, sage or knave, nay, the whole\nuniverse, is Naraya _n_ a, the Supreme Spirit.\n\n18\\. As many have merely heard of snow but not seen it, so many are the\nreligious preachers who have read only in books about the attributes of God,\nbut have not realised\n\np. 103\n\nthem in their lives. And as many may have seen but not tasted it, so many are\nthe religious teachers who have got only a glimpse of Divine Glory, but have\nnot understood its real essence. He who has tasted the snow can say what it is\nlike. He who has enjoyed the society of God in different aspects, now as a\nservant, now as a friend, now as a lover, or as being absorbed in Him, &c., he\nalone can tell what are the attributes of God.\n\n19\\. As the lamp does not burn without oil, so man cannot live without God.\n\n20\\. The human body is like a boiling pot, and the mind and the senses are\nlike water, rice or potato, &c. in it. Put the pot with its ingredients on the\nfire; it will be so hot as to burn your finger when you touch it. But the heat\ndoes not belong to the pot, nor anything contained in it, but is in the fire.\nSo it is the fire of Brahman in man that causes the mind and the senses to\nperform their functions, and when that fire ceases to act, the senses also, or\nthe organs, stop.\n\n21\\. Says God, 'I am the snake that biteth and the charmer that healeth; I am\nthe judge that condemneth and the executioner that whippeth.'\n\n22\\. God tells the thief to go and steal, and at the same time warns the\nhouseholder against the thief.\n\n23\\. How doth the Lord dwell in the body? He dwells in the body like the plug\nof a syringe, i.e. in the body, and yet apart from it.\n\np. 104\n\n24\\. The Lord can pass an elephant through the eye of a needle. He can do\nwhatever He likes.\n\n25\\. As fishes playing in a pond covered over with reeds and scum cannot be\nseen from outside, so God plays in the heart of a man invisibly, being\nscreened by Maya. from human view.\n\n26\\. A man sitting under the shade of the Kalpa-v _ri_ ksha (wishing-tree)\nwished to be a king, and in an instant he was a king. The next moment he\nwished to have a charming damsel, and the damsel was instantly by his side.\nThe man then thought within himself, if a tiger came and devoured him, and\nalas! in an instant he was in the jaws of a tiger! God is like that wishing-\ntree: whosoever in His presence thinks that he is destitute and poor, remains\nas such, but he who thinks and believes that the Lord fulfils all his wants,\nreceives everything from Him.\n\n27\\. The landlord may be very rich, but when a poor cultivator brings a humble\npresent to him with a loving heart, he accepts it with the greatest pleasure\nand satisfaction.\n\n28\\. While a bell is being rung, the repeated ding-dongs can be distinguished\none from the other, but when we stop ringing, then an undistinguishable sound\nonly remains audible. We can easily distinguish one note from the other, as if\neach distinct note had a certain shape; but the continued and unbroken sound\nwhen the ding-dongs have ceased is undistinguishable, as if formless. Like the\nsound of the bell, God is both with and without form.\n\np. 105\n\n29\\. As a boy begins to learn writing by drawing big scrawls, before he can\nmaster the small-hand, so we must learn concentration of the mind by fixing it\nfirst on forms; and when we have attained success therein, we can easily fix\nit upon the formless.\n\n30\\. As a marksman learns to shoot by first taking aim at large and big\nobjects, and the more he acquires the facility, the greater becomes the ease\nwith which he can shoot at the smaller marks on the target, so when the mind\nhas been trained to be fixed on images having form, it becomes easy for it to\nbe fixed upon images having no form.\n\n31\\. God is the Absolute and Eternal Brahman, as well as the Father of the\nUniverse. The indivisible Brahman is like a vast shoreless ocean, without\nbounds and limits, in which I can only struggle and sink. But when I approach\nthe always sportive (active) personal Deity (Hari), I get peace, like the\nsinking man who nears the shore.\n\n32\\. God is formless, and is with form too, and He is that which transcends\nboth form and formlessness. He alone can say what else He is.\n\n33\\. At a certain stage of his path of devotion, the devotee finds\nsatisfaction in God with form; at another stage, in God without form.\n\n34\\. The God with form is visible, nay, we can touch Him face to face, as with\none's dearest friend.\n\n35\\. As at one time I am clothed, and at another time naked, so Brahman is at\none time with attributes and at another without.\n\np. 106\n\n38\\. As water when congealed becomes ice, so the visible form of the Almighty\nis the materialised manifestation of the all-pervading formless Brahman. It\nmay be called, in fact, Sat- _k_ it-ananda solidified. As the ice, being part\nand parcel of the water, remains in the water for a time and afterwards melts\nin it, so the Personal God is part and parcel of the Impersonal. He rises from\nthe Impersonal, remains there, and ultimately merges into it and disappears.\n\n37\\. His name is Intelligence; His abode is Intelligence too, and He, the\nLord, is Intelligence Himself.\n\n38\\. Two are the occasions when the Lord smiles. First, when brothers remove\nthe chains which partition off the family property, saying, This is mine and\nthat is thine;' and secondly, when the patient is on the point of death, and\nthe physician says, 'I will cure him.'\n\n39\\. Lunatics, drunkards, and children sometimes give out the truth\nunconsciously, as if inspired by Heaven.\n\n40\\. The sun is many times larger than the earth, but owing to the great\ndistance it appears like a small disk. So the Lord is infinitely great, but\nowing to our being too far from Him we fall very, very short of comprehending\nHis real greatness.\n\n41\\. Knowingly or unknowingly, consciously or unconsciously, in whatever state\nwe utter His name, we acquire the merit of such utterance. A man who\nvoluntarily goes into a river and bathes therein gets the benefit of the bath;\n\np. 107\n\nso does likewise he who has been pushed into the river by another, or who\nwhile sleeping soundly has water thrown upon him by another.\n\n42\\. Satan never enters the house wherein are always sung the praises of Hari.\n\n43\\. A king having committed the mortal crime of killing a Brahma _n_ a, went\nto the hermitage of a sage to learn what penance he must perform in order to\nbe purified. The sage was absent from home, but his son was there. The son\nhearing the case of the king, said, 'Repeat the name of God (Rama) three times\nand your sin will be expiated.' When the sage came back and heard the penance\nprescribed by his son, he said to him in great wrath, 'Sins committed in\nmyriads of births are purged at once by but once uttering the name of the\nAlmighty; how weak must be thy faith, O son, that thou hast ordered that name\nto be repeated thrice! For this offence of thine go and become a Ka _n_ _d_\nala.' And the son became the Guhaka Ka _n_ _d_ ala of the Ramaya _n_ a.\n\n44\\. Consciously or unconsciously, in whatever way one falls into the trough\nof nectar, one becomes immortal. Similarly, whosoever utters the name of the\nDeity voluntarily or involuntarily finds immortality in the end.\n\n45\\. As a large and powerful steamer moves swiftly over the waters, towing\nrafts and barges in its wake, so when a Saviour descends, He easily carries\nthousands across the ocean of Maya (illusion).\n\np. 108\n\n46\\. When the flood comes, it overflows rivers and streams, and makes one\nwatery surface of all adjacent lands. But the rain-water flows away through\nfixed channels. When the Saviour becomes incarnate, all are saved through His\ngrace. The Siddhas (perfect ones) only save themselves with much pain and\npenance.\n\n47\\. When a mighty raft of wood floats down a stream, it can carry a hundred\nmen, and still it does not sink. A reed floating down may sink with the weight\nof even a crow. So when a Saviour becomes incarnate, innumerable are the men\nwho find salvation by taking refuge under Him. The Siddha only saves himself\nwith much toil and trouble.\n\n48\\. The locomotive engine reaches the destination itself, and also draws and\ntakes with it a long train of loaded wagons. So likewise act the Saviours.\nThey carry multitudes of men, heavily laden with the cares and sorrows of the\nworld, to the feet of the Almighty.\n\n48\\. When Bhagavan _S_ ri Rama _k_ andra came to this world, seven sages only\ncould recognise Him to be the God incarnate. So when God descends into this\nworld, few only can recognise His Divine nature.\n\n50\\. On the tree of Sat- _k_ it-ananda there are innumerable Ramas, K _ri_ sh\n_n_ as, Christs, &c.; one or two of them come down into this world now and\nthen, and produce mighty changes and revolutions.\n\n51\\. The Avatara or Saviour is the messenger of God. He is like the Viceroy of\na mighty monarch. As when\n\np. 109\n\nthere is some disturbance in a far-off province the king sends his viceroy to\nquell it; so whenever there is any waning of religion in any part of the\nworld, God sends His Avatara there.\n\n52\\. It is one and the same Avatara that, having plunged into the ocean of\nlife, rises up in one place and is known as K _ri_ sh _n_ a, and diving again\nrises in another place and is known as Christ.\n\n53\\. In some seasons water can be obtained from the great depths of the wells\nonly and with great difficulty, but when the country is flooded in the rainy\nseason, water is obtained with ease everywhere. So ordinarily, God is reached\nwith great pains through prayers and penances, but when the flood of\nIncarnation descends, God is seen anywhere and everywhere.\n\n54\\. A Siddha-purusha (perfect one) is like an archaeologist who removes the\ndust and lays open an old well which was covered up during ages of disuse by\nrank growth. The Avatara, on the other hand, is like a great engineer who\nsinks a new well in a place where there was no water before. Great men can\ngive salvation to those only who have the waters of piety and goodness hidden\nin themselves, but the Saviour saves him too whose heart is devoid of all\nlove, and dry as a desert.\n\n55\\. Think not that Rama, Sita, _S_ ri K _ri_ sh _n_ a, Radha, Ar _g_ una,\n&c., were not historical personages, but mere allegories, or that the\nScriptures have an inner and esoteric meaning only. Nay, they were human\nbeings of flesh and\n\np. 110\n\nblood just as you are, but because they were Divinities, their lives can be\ninterpreted both historically and spiritually.\n\n56\\. None knoweth the immensity of the sacrifice which the Godhead maketh when\nit becomes incarnate or becomes flesh.\n\n57\\. The Saviours are to Brahman as the waves are to the ocean.\n\n58\\. What is the state which a Siddha attains? (A perfect man and well-cooked\nfood are both called siddha. There is a pun here on the word.) As potato or\nbrinjal, &c., when boiled properly (siddha), becomes soft and tender, so when\na man reaches perfection (Siddha) he becomes all humility and tenderness.\n\n59\\. Five are the kinds of Siddhas found in this world:--\n\n(1) The Svapna Siddhas are those who attain perfection by means of dream\ninspiration.\n\n(2) The Mantra Siddhas are those who attain perfection by means of any sacred\nmantra.\n\n(3) The Ha _th_ at Siddhas are those who attain perfection suddenly. As a poor\nman may suddenly become rich by finding a hidden treasure, or by marrying into\na rich family, so many sinners become pure all of a sudden, and enter the\nKingdom of Heaven.\n\n(4) The K _ri_ pa Siddhas are those who attain perfection through the tangible\ngrace of the Almighty, as a poor man is made wealthy by the kindness of a\nking.\n\n(s) The Nitya Siddhas are those who are ever-perfect. As a gourd or a pumpkin-\ncreeper brings forth fruit first and\n\np. 111\n\nthen its flower, so the ever-perfect is born a Siddha, and all his seeming\nexertions after perfection are merely for the sake of setting examples to\nhumanity.\n\n60\\. There is a fabled species of birds called 'Homa,' which live so high up\nin the heavens, and so dearly love those regions, that they never condescend\nto come down to the earth. Even their eggs, which, when laid in the sky, begin\nto fall down to the earth attracted by gravity, are said to get hatched in the\nmiddle of their downward course and give birth to the young ones. The\nfledgelings at once find out that they are falling down, and immediately\nchange their course and begin to fly up towards their home, drawn thither by\ninstinct. Men such as _S_ uka Deva, Narada, Jesus, Sa _m_ kara _k_ arya and\nothers, are like those birds, who even in their boyhood give up all\nattachments to the things of this world and betake themselves to the highest\nregions of true Knowledge and Divine Light. These men are called Nitya\nSiddhas.\n\n61\\. The Divine sages form, as it were, the inner circle of God's nearest\nrelatives. They are like friends, companions, kinsmen of God. Ordinary beings\nform the outer circle or are the creatures of God.\n\n62\\. When the shell of an ordinary cocoa-nut is pierced through, the nail\nenters the kernel of the nut too. But in the case of the dry nut, the kernel\nbecomes separate from the shell, and so when the shell is pierced the kernel\nis not touched. Jesus was like the dry nut, i.e. His inner soul\n\np. 112\n\nwas separate from His physical shell, and consequently the sufferings of the\nbody did not affect Him.\n\n63\\. Once a holy man, while passing through a crowded street, accidentally\ntrod upon the toe of a wicked person. The wicked man, furious with rage, beat\nthe Sadhu mercilessly, till he fell to the ground in a faint. His disciples\ntook great pains and adopted various measures to bring him back to\nconsciousness, and when they saw that he had recovered a little, one of them\nasked, 'Sir, do you recognise who is attending upon you?' The Sadhu replied,\n'He who beat me.' A true Sadhu finds no distinction between a friend and a\nfoe.\n\n64\\. The swan can separate the milk from water; it drinks only the milk,\nleaving the water untouched. Other birds cannot do so. Similarly God is\nintimately mixed up with Maya; ordinary men cannot see Him separately from\nMaya. Only the Paramaha _m_ sa (the great soul--here is a pun on the word 'ha\n_m_ sa,' which means both soul and swan) throws off Maya, and takes up God\nonly.\n\n65\\. The wind carries the smell of the sandal-wood as well as that of ordure,\nbut does not mix with either. Similarly a perfect man lives in the world, but\ndoes not mix with it.\n\n66\\. A perfect man is like a lotus-leaf in the water or like a mud-fish in the\nmarsh. Neither of these is polluted by the element in which it lives.\n\n67\\. As water passes under a bridge but never stagnates,\n\np. 113\n\nso money passes through the hands of 'The Free' who never hoard it.\n\n68\\. As a rope that is burnt retains its shape intact, but has become all\nashes, so that nothing can be bound with it; similarly,(the man who is\nemancipated retains the form of his egoism, but not an idea of vanity (Aha _m_\nkara).\n\n69\\. As an aquatic bird, such as a pelican, dives into water, but the water\ndoes not wet its plumage, so the perfect man lives in the world, but the world\ndoes not touch him.\n\n70\\. When the head of a goat is severed from its body, the trunk moves about\nfor some time, still showing the signs of life. Similarly, though the Aha _m_\nkara (vanity or egoism) is beheaded in the perfect man, yet sufficient of its\nvitality is left to make such a man carry on the functions of physical life;\nbut that much is not sufficient to bind him again to the world.\n\n71\\. Ornaments cannot be made of pure gold. Some alloy must be mixed with it.\nA man totally devoid of Maya. will not survive more than twenty-one days. So\nlong as the man has body, he must have some Maya, however small it may be, to\ncarry on the functions of the body.\n\n72\\. In the play of hide-and-seek, if the player once succeeds in touching the\nnon-player, called the grand-dame (Boo _r i_), he is no longer liable to be\nmade a thief. Similarly, by once seeing the Almighty, a man is no longer bound\ndown by the fetters of the world. The boy, by touching\n\np. 114\n\nthe Boo _r i_, is free to go wherever he wishes, without being pursued, and no\none can make him a thief. Similarly, in this world's playground, there is no\nfear to him who has once touched the feet of the Almighty.\n\n73\\. The iron, once converted into gold by the touch of the Philosopher's\nstone, may be kept under the ground, or thrown into a rubbish-heap, but it\nremains always gold, and will never return to its former condition. Similar is\nthe case with him who has once touched the feet of the Almighty. Whether he\ndwells in the bustle of the world, or in the solitude of forests, nothing will\never contaminate him.\n\n74\\. The steel sword turns into a golden sword by the touch of the\nPhilosopher's stone, and though it retains its former form it becomes\nincapable of injuring any one. Similarly, the outward form of a man who has\ntouched the feet of the Almighty is not changed, but he no longer doeth any\nevil.\n\n75\\. The loadstone rock under the sea attracts the ship sailing over it, draws\nout all its iron nails, separates its planks, and sinks the vessel into the\ndeep. Thus, when the human soul is attracted by the magnetism of Universal\nConsciousness, the latter destroys in a moment all its individuality and\nselfishness, and plunges it in the ocean of God's infinite Love.\n\n76\\. Milk and water, when brought into contact, are sure to mix so that the\nmilk can never be separated again. So if the neophyte, thirsting after self-\nimprovement, mixes\n\np. 115\n\nindiscriminately with all sorts of worldly men, he not only loses his ideals,\nbut his former faith, love, and enthusiasm also die away imperceptibly. When,\nhowever, you convert the milk into butter, it no longer mixes with water, but\nfloats over it. Similarly, when the soul once attains God-head, it may live in\nany company, without ever being affected by its evil influences.\n\n77\\. So long as no child is born to her, the newly-married girl remains deeply\nabsorbed in her domestic duties. But no sooner is a son born, than she leaves\noff all her house-hold concerns, and no longer finds any pleasure in them. On\nthe contrary, she fondles the newborn baby the livelong day, and kisses it\nwith intense joy. Thus man, in his state of ignorance, performs all sorts of\nworldly works, but no sooner does he see the Almighty, than he finds no longer\nany relish in them. On the contrary, his happiness now consists only in\nserving the Deity and doing His works alone.\n\n78\\. So long as a man is far from the market, he hears a loud and indistinct\nbuzzing only, something like 'Ho! Ho!' But when he enters the market he no\nlonger hears the uproar, but perceives distinctly that some one is bargaining\nfor potatoes, another for Brinjal, and so on. As long as a man is far away\nfrom God, he is in the midst of the noise and confusion of reason, argument,\nand discussion; but when once a person approaches the Almighty, all\nreasonings, arguments, and discussions cease, and he understands the mysteries\nof God with vivid and clear perception.\n\np. 116\n\n79\\. So long as a man calls aloud, 'Allah Ho! Allah Ho! (O God! O God!), be\nsure that he has not found God, for he who has found him becomes still.\n\n80\\. So long as the bee is outside the petals of the lotus, and has not tasted\nits honey, it hovers round the flower, emitting its buzzing sound; but when it\nis inside the flower, it drinks its nectar noiselessly. So long as a man\nquarrels and disputes about doctrines and dogmas, he has not tasted the nectar\nof true faith; when he has tasted it he becomes still.\n\n81\\. Little children play with dolls in a room apart just as they like, but as\nsoon as their mother comes in they throw aside the dolls and run to her\ncrying, 'Mamma, Mamma!' You also are now playing in this world deeply absorbed\nwith the dolls of wealth, honour, and fame, and have no fear or anxiety. But\nif you once see the Divine Mother entering in, you will not find pleasure any\nmore in wealth, honour, and fame. Leaving off all these you will run to Her.\n\n82\\. The naked Sage, Totapuri, used to say, 'If a brass pot be not rubbed\ndaily, it will get rusty. So if a man does not contemplate the Deity daily,\nhis heart will grow impure.' To him _S_ ri Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a replied, 'Yes,\nbut if the vessel be of gold, it does not require daily cleaning. The man who\nhas reached God requires prayers or penances no more.'\n\n83\\. He who has once tasted the refined and crystalline sugar-candy, finds no\npleasure in raw treacle; he who has slept in a palace, will not find pleasure\nin lying down in\n\np. 117\n\na dirty hovel. So the soul that has once tasted the sweetness of the Divine\nBliss finds no delight in the ignoble pleasures of the world.\n\n84\\. She who has a king for her lover will not accept the homage of a street\nbeggar. So the soul that has once found favour in the sight of the Lord does\nnot want the paltry things of this world.\n\n85\\. When a man is in the plains he sees the lowly grass and the mighty pine-\ntree and says, 'How big is the tree and how small is the grass!' But when he\nascends the mountain and looks from its high peak to the plain below, the\nmighty pine-tree and the lowly grass blend into one indistinct mass of green\nverdure. So in the sight of worldly men there are differences of rank and\nposition, but when the Divine sight is opened there remains no distinction of\nhigh and low.\n\n86\\. When water is poured into an empty vessel a bubbling noise ensues, but\nwhen the vessel is full no such noise is heard. Similarly, the man who has not\nfound God is full of vain disputations. But when he has seen Him, all vanities\ndisappear, and he silently enjoys the Bliss Divine.\n\n87\\. A woman naturally feels shy to relate to all the talk she daily has with\nher husband, save to her own companions. Similarly, a devotee does not like to\nrelate to any one but a true Bhakta (devotee) the ecstatic joys which he\nexperiences in his Divine communion; nay, sometimes he becomes impatient of\nrelating his experiences even to those of his own class.\n\np. 118\n\n88\\. The moth once seeing the light never returns to darkness; the ant dies in\nthe sugar-heap, but never retreats therefrom. Similarly, a good devotee gladly\nsacrifices his life for his God by renunciation.\n\n89\\. Why does the God-lover find such pleasure in addressing the Deity as\nMother? Because the child is more free with its mother, and consequently she\nis dearer to the child than any one else.\n\n90\\. The pious man, like a hemp-smoker, finds no pleasure in singing the\npraises of the Almighty alone. (The hemp-smoker never finds pleasure in\nsmoking alone.)\n\n91\\. If a strange animal enters a herd of cows, it is driven off by the\ncombined attacks of the whole herd. But let only a cow enter, and all the\nother cows will make friends with her by mutual licking of bodies. Thus, when\na devotee meets with another devotee, both experience great happiness and feel\nloth to separate, but when a scoffer enters the circle they carefully avoid\nhim.\n\n92\\. What is the strength of a devotee? He is a child of God, and tears are\nhis greatest strength.\n\n93\\. The young of a monkey clasps and clings to its mother. The young kitten\ncannot clasp its mother, but mews piteously whenever it is near her. If the\nyoung monkey lets go its hold on its mother, it falls down and gets hurt. This\nis because it depends upon its own strength; but the kitten runs no such risk,\nas the mother herself carries it about from place to place. Such is the\ndifference between self-reliance and entire resignation to the will of God.\n\np. 119\n\n94\\. It is fabled that the pearl oyster leaves its bed at the bottom of the\nsea and comes up to the surface to catch the rain-water when the star Svati is\nin the ascendant. It floats about on the surface of the sea with its mouth\nagape, until it succeeds in catching a drop of the marvellous Svati-rain. Then\nit dives down to its sea-bed and there rests, till it has succeeded in\nfashioning a beautiful pearl out of that rain-drop. Similarly, there are some\ntrue and eager aspirants who travel from place to place in search of that\nwatchword from a godly and perfect preceptor (Sad-guru) which will open for\nthem the gate of eternal bliss, and if in their diligent search one is\nfortunate enough to meet such a Guru and get from him the much-longed-for\n_logos_ , which is sure to break down all fetters, he at once retires from\nsociety, enters into the deep recess of his own heart and rests there, till he\nhas succeeded in gaining eternal peace.\n\n95\\. The flint may remain for myriads of years under water, still it does not\nlose its inner fire. Strike it with iron whenever you like and out flows the\nglowing spark. So is the true devotee firm in his faith. Though he may remain\nsurrounded by all the impurities of the world, he never loses his faith and\nlove. He becomes entranced as soon as he hears the name of the Almighty.\n\n96\\. The Stone may remain for myriads of years in water, and the water will\nnever penetrate it. But clay is soon softened into mud by the contact of\nwater. So the strong heart of the faithful does not despair in the midst of\ntrials\n\np. 120\n\nand persecutions, but the man of weak faith is easily shaken even by the most\ntrifling cause.\n\n97\\. How sweet is the simplicity of the child! He prefers a doll to all riches\nand wealth. So is the faithful devotee. No one else can throw aside wealth and\nhonour to take God only.\n\n98\\. God is like unto a hill of sugar. A small ant carries away from it a\nsmall grain of sugar, the bigger ant takes from it a larger grain. But the\nhill remains as large as before. So are the devotees of God. They become\necstatic with even a grain of one Divine attribute. No one can contain within\nhim all His attributes.\n\n99\\. A logician once asked _S_ ri Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a, 'What are knowledge,\nknower, and the object known?' To which he replied, 'Good man, I do not know\nall these niceties of scholastic learning. I know only my Mother Divine, and\nthat I am Her son.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[98:1](rls25.htm#fr_14) Some more of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a's sayings have been\nsent to me lately, but their publication will have to wait for another\nopportunity\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Sayings of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a: 100-199](rls26.htm)\n\n"
