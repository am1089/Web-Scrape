To which (He the Lord) replied:\n\n"There was neither Sa\xe1\xb9\xad 2 nor asa\xe1\xb9\xad nor Sa\xe1\xb9\xad-asa\xe1\xb9\xad. From it, \xe1\xb9\xadamas (darkness) was\nevolved. From \xe1\xb9\xadamas came bh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8di; 3from bh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8di came \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, from \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, v\xc4\x81yu;\nfrom v\xc4\x81yu, agni (fire); from agni, \xc4\x81pas (water); and from \xc4\x81pas, p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab\n(earth). Then it became an egg. After remaining so for one (divine) year, it\nsplit into two and became earth below, 4 the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b above and in the midst, the\ninfinite Purusha of a divine form of myriads of heads, eyes, feet and hands.\nPrior to the bh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadas (elements), he had evolved M\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadyu (time or death) of three\nletters 5, three heads, and three feet, and having a kha\xe1\xb9\x87da-para\xc5\x9bu 6 (broken\n\np. 62\n\naxe). To him, Brahma (the Purusha) spoke. He entered Brahma himself and\nevolved mentally the seven sons 1 and these Havir\xc4\x81ts (or sons) as well as the\nseven praj\xc4\x81pa\xe1\xb9\xadis (progenitors). Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as 2 were born from His mouth,\nKsha\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadriyas from His hands, Vai\xc5\x9byas from His thighs, and from the feet were\nborn the \xc5\x9au\xe1\xb8\x8dras. The moon was born from His manas (mind), the sun from His\neyes, v\xc4\x81yu from (His) ears and pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as from (His) heart. Thus all things were\nborn."\n\n##### Kha\xe1\xb9\x87da II\n\n"From ap\xc4\x81na came Nish\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8das, Yakshas, R\xc4\x81kshasas, and Gan\xe1\xb8\x8dharvas. From (His)\nbones, arose the mountains. From His hairs arose the herbs and the trees. From\nHis forehead, Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra was born through His anger. The breath of this great Being\nbecame the \xe1\xb9\x9agve\xe1\xb8\x8da, Yajurve\xe1\xb8\x8da, S\xc4\x81mave\xe1\xb8\x8da, A\xe1\xb9\xadharvave\xe1\xb8\x8da, \xc5\x9a\xc4\xabksh\xc4\x81 (the science of\nthe proper pronunciation and articulation of sounds), Kalpa (the science of\nmethodology), Vy\xc4\x81kara\xe1\xb9\x87a (grammar), Niruk\xe1\xb9\xada (glossarial explanation of obsolete\nand other terms in Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das), Chhan\xe1\xb8\x8das (prosody or ve\xe1\xb8\x8dic metre), Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadisha\n(astronomy), Ny\xc4\x81ya (logic), M\xc4\xabm\xc4\x81ms\xc4\x81 (including rituals and ve\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb9\xada),\nDharma\xc5\x9b\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras, commentaries, glosses and all beings. This \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (or the Self of\nPurusha) is Hira\xe1\xb9\x87yajyo\xe1\xb9\xadis (or golden or effulgent Light) into which all the\nuniverse is absorbed. He divided \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 (his Self) into two moieties; out of one\nmoiety, the woman was created; and out of the other, man. Having become a\n\xe1\xb8\x8ceva, He created the \xe1\xb8\x8cevas. Having become a \xe1\xb9\x9ashi, He created the \xe1\xb9\x9ashis; also\nHe created Yakshas, R\xc4\x81kshasas, Gan\xe1\xb8\x8dharvas, wild and domestic beasts and others\nsuch as cows, bulls, mares and horses, she-asses and asses and Vi\xc5\x9bvambhara\n(the Supporter) and Vi\xc5\x9bvambhar\xc4\x81 (the earth). Becoming Vai\xc5\x9bv\xc4\x81nara (fire) at the\nend (of creation), He burnt up all objects. Then (in dissolution), p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab was\nabsorbed in \xc4\x81pas, \xc4\x81pas in agni, agni in v\xc4\x81yu, v\xc4\x81yu in \xc4\x81ka\xc5\x9b, \xc4\x81ka\xc5\x9b in in\xe1\xb8\x8driyas\n(organs),\n\np. 63\n\nin\xe1\xb8\x8driyas into \xe1\xb9\xadanm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadras (rudimentary properties), \xe1\xb9\xadanm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadras into bh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8di,\nbh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8di into maha\xe1\xb9\xad, maha\xe1\xb9\xad into avyak\xe1\xb9\xada, avyak\xe1\xb9\xada into akshara (the\nindestructible), akshara into Lamas (darkness). And Lamas becomes one with the\nsupreme Lord. And then there is neither Sa\xe1\xb9\xad nor asa\xe1\xb9\xad, nor Sa\xe1\xb9\xad-asa\xe1\xb9\xad. This is\nthe teaching of Nirv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and this is the teaching of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. Yea, This is\nthe teaching of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das."\n\n##### Kha\xe1\xb9\x87da III\n\n"At first, there was Asa\xe1\xb9\xad, unborn, non-existent, unsupported, soundless,\ntouchless, formless, tasteless, odourless, and decayless. The undaunted man\nnever grieves, as he knows \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 to be great, all-pervading and unborn. It\n(\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma) is pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87aless, mouthless, earless, tongueless, manas-less, \xe1\xb9\xadejas-less,\neyeless, nameless, go\xe1\xb9\xadraless (or clanless), headless, handless, feetless, non-\nunctuous, bloodless, non-measurable, neither long nor short, neither gross nor\natomic, neither great nor small, endless, indescribable, nonreturnable, non-\nluminous, not hidden, having neither inside nor outside, neither eating\nanything nor being eaten by others. Some one (out of many) attains to this\n(\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) by the six means of sa\xe1\xb9\xadya (truth), \xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81na (charity), \xe1\xb9\xadapas (religious\nausterities), non-injury to any creature, celibacy and complete indifference\nto worldy objects; 1 and there are no other means. Whoever feels happy with\nthe thought \'I know That\', that learned person\'s pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a will never get out of\nhis body at the moment of death, but will become absorbed in Brahman; and\nbeing absorbed in Brahman, he attains the state of Brahman Itself as he who\nknows this."\n\n##### Kha\xe1\xb9\x87da IV\n\n"In the middle of the heart is a red fleshy mass in which is the \xe1\xb8\x8dahara-lotus.\nLike the lotus, it opens into many (petals). There are ten openings in the\nheart. The (different kinds of) pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as are located there. Whenever he (\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81)\nis united with\n\np. 64\n\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, he sees cities with rivers and other variegated things; when united\nwith vy\xc4\x81na, he sees \xe1\xb8\x8cevas and \xe1\xb9\x9ashis; when united with ap\xc4\x81na, he sees Yakshas,\nR\xc4\x81kshasas and Gan\xe1\xb8\x8dharvas; when united with ud\xc4\x81na, he perceives the celestial\nworld, \xe1\xb8\x8cevas, Skan\xe1\xb8\x8da (K\xc4\x81r\xe1\xb9\xadikeya or the six-faced Mars), and Jayan\xe1\xb9\xada (In\xe1\xb8\x8dra\'s\nson); when united with sam\xc4\x81na, he sees the celestial world and the treasures\n(of Kubera); when united with rambh\xc4\x81 (a n\xc4\x81di hereafter given out), he sees\nwhatever is seen or not seen, heard or not heard, eaten or not eaten, asa\xe1\xb9\xad or\nSa\xe1\xb9\xad and all else.\n\n"There are ten midis; in each of these are seventy-one. And these become\n72,000 branch n\xc4\x81dis. When \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 sleeps therein, it produces sound; but when\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 sleeps in the second ko\xc5\x9ba (or sheath) then it sees this world and the\nhigher as also knows all the sounds. This is spoken of as sampras\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da (deep\nsleep rest). Then pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a protects the body. The n\xc4\x81dis are full of blood, of the\ncolours green, blue, yellow, red, and white. Now this \xe1\xb8\x8dahara-lotus has many\npetals like a lily. Like a hair divided into 1,000 parts, the n\xc4\x81dis called\nhi\xe1\xb9\xada are. The divine \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 sleeps in the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b of the heart, in the supreme ko\xc5\x9ba\n(or \xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8damaya sheath); sleeping there, it has no desires, no dreams, no \xe1\xb8\x8deva-\nworlds, no yaj\xc3\xb1as or sacrificer, no mother or father, no relative, no kinsman,\nno thief, or no Brahman-slayer. Its body is \xe1\xb9\xadejas (resplendent effulgence) and\nof the nature of nectar (or the immortal). It is as if in sport, a water-\nlotus. When he returns again to the waking state by the same way (he quitted\nor went in before to the heart), he is Samr\xc4\x81t 1. Thus says he."\n\n##### Kha\xe1\xb9\x87da V 2\n\n"That which joins one place (or centre) with another is the n\xc4\x81dis which bind\nthem.

To\nthis He replied: "There is a mass of red flesh in the middle of the heart. In\nit, there is a lotus called \xe1\xb8\x8dahara. It buds forth in many petals like a water-\nlily. In the middle of it is an ocean (samu\xe1\xb8\x8dra). 1 In its midst is a koka 2\n(bird). In it there are four n\xc4\x81dis. They are ram\xc4\x81, aram\xc4\x81, Ichchh\xc4\x81 and\npunarbhava.

It is neither spirit nor\nmatter nor a commingling of both.\n\n[61:3](tmu13.htm#fr_38) Bh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8di is \xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81masa aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra according to Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\n[61:4](tmu13.htm#fr_39) "Above and below" refers not to the position but only\nto the state, of matter, gross or subtle. "In the midst" implies that \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b and\nearth are soaked in and with spirit.\n\n[61:5](tmu13.htm#fr_40) This refers to the first triune manifestation of\nPurusha or spirit through time when only there is activity, M\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadyu or K\xc4\x81la is\nthe first manifestation whereas Yama (or the God of death) is the secondary\none dealing with the death of creatures lower down.\n\n[61:6](tmu13.htm#fr_41) Kha\xe1\xb9\x87da means divided or with parts. Parasu literally\ninjuring another. Hence M\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadyu with his kha\xe1\xb9\x87da-parasu divided eternal time into\nits parts and conditions the absolute through primordial matter. In the\nPur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as and other books, M\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadyu and Yama are represented as having an axe\nbroken in a conflict.\n\n[62:1](tmu13.htm#fr_42) This refers to the septenary manifestation from the\ntriune one; also to the sub-septenary ones.\n\n[62:2](tmu13.htm#fr_43) In other words beings of Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva, Rajas and \xe1\xb9\xacamas and\nan admixture of these were born.\n\n[63:1](tmu13.htm#fr_44) The word an\xc4\x81sakena (non-injury) is repeated in the\ntext which is wrong.\n\n[64:1](tmu13.htm#fr_45) Lit., one producing sound.\n\n[64:2](tmu13.htm#fr_46) In this chapter are given out the several\ncorrespondences of the \xe1\xb8\x8devas (or the presiding spiritual deities) and of the\nobjects to the five organs of sense, the five organs of action, and the\nanta\xe1\xb8\xa5kara\xe1\xb9\x87a (or lower mind) composed of manas, bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra, and chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada.\n\n[65:1](tmu13.htm#fr_47) Probably pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, and \xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da refer to the\nsheaths formed by them.\n\n[66:1](tmu13.htm#fr_48) Although in the original manas, bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, etc., are in\nthe middle, yet they are inserted here after the karmen\xe1\xb8\x8driyas.\n\n[67:1](tmu13.htm#fr_49) N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a is the Universal Self.
