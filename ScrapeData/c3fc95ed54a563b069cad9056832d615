XXI.\n\nKrishn\xcc\x81a encourages his parents; places Ugrasena on the throne; becomes the\npupil of Sandipani, whose son he recovers from the sea: he kills the marine\ndemon Panchajana, and makes a horn of his shell.\n\nHAVING permitted to Devaki and Vasudeva an interval of true knowledge, through\nthe contemplation of his actions, Hari again spread the delusions of his power\nover them and the tribe of Yadu. He said to them, "Mother; venerable father;\nyou have both been long observed by Sankarshan\xcc\x81a and myself with sorrow, and\nin fear of Kansa. He whose time passes not in respect to his father and\nmother, is a vile being, who descends in vain from virtuous parents. The lives\nof those produce good fruit, who reverence their parents, their spiritual\nguides, the Brahmans, and the gods. Pardon therefore, father, the impropriety\nof which we may have been culpable, in resenting without your orders, to which\nwe acknowledge that we are subject, the oppression we suffered from the power\nand violence of Kansa." Thus speaking, they offered homage to the elders of\nthe Yadu tribe in order, and then in a suitable manner paid their respects to\nthe citizens. The wives of Kansa, and those of his father, then surrounded the\nbody of the king, lying on the ground, and bewailed his fate in deep\naffliction. Hari in various ways expressed his regret for what had chanced,\nand endeavoured to console them, his own eyes being suffused with tears. The\nfoe of Madhu then liberated Ugrasena from confinement, and placed him on the\nthrone, which the death of his son had left vacant. The chief of the Yadavas,\nbeing crowned, performed the funeral rites of Kansa, and of the rest of the\nslain. When the ceremony was over, and Ugrasena had resumed his royal seat,\nKrishn\xcc\x81a addressed him, and said, "Sovereign lord, command boldly what else is\nto be done. The curse of Yayati has pronounced our race unworthy of dominion\n1; but with me, for your servant, you may issue your orders to the gods. How\nshould kings disobey them?"\n\np. 561\n\nThus having spoken, the human Ke\xc5\x9bava summoned mentally the deity of the wind,\nwho came upon the instant, and said to him, "Go, Vayu, to Indra, and desire\nhim to lay aside his pomp, and resign to Ugrasena his splendid hall Sudharman:\ntell him that Krishn\xcc\x81a commands him to send the royal hall, the unrivalled gem\nof princely courts, for the assemblage of the race of Yadu." Accordingly Vayu\nwent, and delivered the message to the husband of \xc5\x9aachi, who immediately gave\nup to him the hall Sudharman, and Vayu conveyed it to the Yadavas, the chiefs\nof whom thenceforth possessed this celestial court, emblazoned with jewels,\nand defended by the arm of Govinda. The two excellent Yadu youths, versed in\nall knowledge, and possessed of all wisdom, then submitted to instruction, as\nthe disciples of teachers. Accordingly they repaired to Sandipani--who, though\nborn in Ka\xc5\x9bi, resided at Avanti--to study the science of arms, and, becoming\nhis pupils, were obedient and attentive to their master, exhibiting an example\nto all men of the observance of instituted rules. In the course of sixty-four\ndays they had gone through the elements of military science, with the\ntreatises on the use of arms, and directions for the mystic incantations,\nwhich secure the aid of supernatural weapons 2. Sandipani, astonished at such\nproficiency, and knowing that it exceeded human faculties, imagined that the\nsun and moon had become his scholars. When they had acquired all that he could\nteach, they said to him, "Now say what present shall be given to you, as the\npreceptor\'s fee." The prudent Sandipani, perceiving that they were endowed\nwith more than mortal powers, requested them to give him his dead son, drowned\nin the sea of Prabhasa 3. Taking up their arms, they marched against the\nocean; but the all-comprehending sea said to them, "I have not killed the son\nof Sandipani; a demon\n\np. 562\n\nnamed Panchajana, who lives in the form of a conch shell, seized the boy: he\nis still under my waters. On hearing this, Krishn\xcc\x81a plunged into the sea; and\nhaving slain the vile Panchajana, he took the conch shell, which was formed of\nhis bones (and bore it as his horn), the sound of which fills the demon hosts\nwith dismay, animates the vigour of the gods, and annihilates unrighteousness.\nThe heroes also recovered the boy from the pains of death, and restored him in\nhis former person to his father. Rama and Janarddana then returned to Mathura,\nwhich was well presided over by Ugrasena, and abounded in a happy population\nboth of men and women 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[560:1](vp138.htm#fr_1518) The curse pronounced on the elder sons of Yayati,\non their refusing to take upon them their father\'s infirmities.
