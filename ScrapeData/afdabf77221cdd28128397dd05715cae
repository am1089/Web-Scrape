And like a piece of cloth.\n\nAs of a folded piece of cloth we do not know clearly whether it is a piece of\ncloth or some other thing, while on its being unfolded it becomes manifest\nthat the folded thing was a piece of cloth; and as, so long as it is folded,\nwe perhaps know that it is a piece of cloth but not of what definite length\nand width it is, while on its being unfolded we know these particulars, and at\nthe same time that the cloth is not different from the folded object; in the\nsame way an effect, such as a piece of cloth, is non-manifest as long as it\nexists in its causes, i. e. the threads, &c. merely, while it becomes manifest\nand is clearly apprehended in consequence of the operations of shuttle, loom,\nweaver, and so on.--Applying this instance of the piece of cloth, first folded\nand then unfolded, to the general case of cause and effect, we conclude that\nthe latter is non-different from the former.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 20](sbe34159.htm)\n\n'
