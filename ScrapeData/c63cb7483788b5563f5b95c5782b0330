Now,\nin this respect, some people,\n\np. 57\n\nthinking themselves clever, take up the (guhu) with the right, and the upabh\n_ri_ t with the left (hand); but let him not do so; for if, in that case, any\none were to say of him, 'Surely, this Adhvaryu has made the Sacrificer's\nspiteful enemy equal to him, and able to cope with him,' then that would\nindeed be likely to come to pass.\n\n11:4:2:22\\. Let him rather do it in this way;--having taken the _g_ uhu with\nboth hands, let him lay it down on the upabh _ri_ t; there is no question\nabout this: it is good for (securing) cattle and life. Let him take them up\nwithout clinking them together,--were he to let them clink together,\ninsecurity of property would befall the Sacrificer: let him, therefore, take\nthem up without clinking them together.\n\n11:4:2:33\\. Now as to the stepping past (the Vedi). By a thunderbolt, indeed,\none, Adhvaryu scatters the Sacrificer's cattle, and by a thunderbolt another\ndrives them together for him. Now that Adhvaryu, doubtless, scatters the\nSacrificer's cattle by a thunderbolt, who steps past with his right (foot) 1\nwhen he is\n\np. 58\n\nabout to call (on the \xc3\x82gnidhra) for the Srausha _t_ , and with his left (foot)\nwhen he has called for the _S_ rausha _t_ ; and that (other) one drives them\ntogether for him who steps past with his left (foot) When he is about to call\nfor the _S_ rausha _t_ , and with his right (foot) when he has called for the\nSrausha _t_ ; for he does indeed drive them together for him.\n\n11:4:2:44\\. Now as to the holding (of the spoons). In this respect, some\npeople, thinking themselves clever, hold the two spoons whilst stretching\nforward both arms; but let him not do so, for if, in that case, any one were\nto say of him, 'Surely, this Sacrificer has made two spears of his arms: he\nwill become a spear-holder,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.\nBut that (navel is the channel of the) central breathing: let him therefore\nhold (the spoon) by lowering them 1 to that (breathing).\n\n11:4:2:55\\. Now as to calling for the _S_ rausha _t_  2: there are six (modes\nof) calling for the Srausha _t_ ,--the descending, the level, the ascending,\nthe feeble, the outward-tending, and the inward-tending.\n\n11:4:2:66\\. Now the descending mode, indeed, it is when he begins in a high\ntone and concludes in a low tone: whoever should wish that any one 3 should be\npoorer,\n\np. 59\n\nlet him begin for him in a high tone and conclude in a low tone; and he will\nthereby become poorer.\n\n11:4:2:77\\. And the level one, indeed, it is when he concludes in the same\ntone in which he has begun: whoever should wish that any one should be neither\nmore prosperous nor poorer, let him conclude for him in the same tone in which\nhe has begun; and he will thereby become neither more prosperous nor poorer.\n\n11:4:2:88\\. And the ascending one, indeed, it is when he begins in a low tone\nand concludes in a high tone: whoever should wish that any one should be more\nprosperous, let him begin for him in a low tone and conclude in a high tone;\nand he will thereby become more prosperous.\n\n11:4:2:99\\. And the feeble one, indeed, it is when he calls for the Srausha\n_t_ in a thin, long-drawn, toneless way: if, in that case, any one were to say\nof him, 'Surely, this Adhvaryu has made the Sacrificer feeble, and submissive\nto his spiteful enemy,' then that would indeed be likely to cone to pass.\n\n11:4:2:1010\\. And the outward-tending (bahi _h_ - _s_ ri) one, indeed, it is\nwhen he opens his lips wide and utters his call at a high, toneless pitch:\ntone being prosperity, he thereby puts prosperity ( _s_ ri) outside (bahis)\nhimself, and becomes hungry (poor).\n\n11:4:2:1111\\. And the inward-tending (anta _h_ - _s_ ri) one, indeed, it is\nwhen he closes his lips, and utters his call at a loud, toneful pitch: tone\nbeing prosperity, he thereby puts prosperity ( _s_ ri) inside (anta _h_ )\nhimself, and becomes an eater of food (rich).\n\np. 60\n\n11:4:2:1212\\. Having kept back (the tone) deep in the breast, as it were, let\nhim (keep up the middle pitch of) the B _ri_ hat (saman) in both (words 'o _m_\n_s_ ravaya'), and finally leave off at a high pitch; there is no question\nabout this: it is good for (securing) cattle and life.\n\n11:4:2:1313\\. Now as to the oblation. In this respect, some people, thinking\nthemselves clever, having turned down the spoon eastwards, and poured out the\noblation, turn it round and place it over the upabh _ri_ t. But let him not do\nthis; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this Adhvaryu\nhas made the Sacrificer dependent on, and submissive to, his spiteful enemy,'\nthen that would indeed be likely to come to pass.\n\n11:4:2:1414\\. And some, having turned down the spoon sideways, and poured out\nthe oblation, turn it round and place it over the upabh _ri_ t. But let him\nnot do so; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this\nAdvaryu has stopped the oblations by (following) the wrong way, he (the\nSacrificer) will either be shattered, or become worm-eaten,' then that would\nindeed be likely to come to pass.\n\n11:4:2:1515\\. Let him rather do it in this way:--having turned down the spoon\neastwards, and poured out the oblation, let him carry it up in the same way\nand place it over the upabh _ri_ t;--there is no question about this: it is\ngood for (securing) cattle and life.\n\n11:4:2:1616\\. One Adhvaryu, indeed, burns the oblations, and another satisfies\nthe oblations; and that Adhvaryu, assuredly, burns the oblations who, having\noffered ghee, offers portions (of sacrificial dishes): indeed, it is with\nreference to him that an invisible voice has said, 'Surely, this Adhvaryu\nburns the oblations.' And he, indeed, satisfies them who\n\np. 61\n\nhaving offered ghee, offers sacrificial portions, and finally again offers\nghee thereon: such a one certainly satisfies them; and, these (oblations)\nhaving been satisfied, the gods fill gold cups (for him) 1.\n\n11:4:2:1717\\. Concerning this, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya said 2, 'When, after making\nan underlayer (of ghee), and cutting portions (from the sacrificial dish), he\nbastes them (with ghee), then, indeed, he satisfies them; and, they being\nsatisfied, the gods fill (for him) gold cups 3.' Now _S_ aulvayana was\nAdhvaryu to those who had Ayasthu _n_ a 4 for their G _ri_ hapati 5.\n\n11:4:2:1818\\. He said, 'Surely, this sacrificial session is supplied with lean\ncattle and scanty ghee; and yet this one, forsooth, thinks himself a G _ri_\nhapati!'\n\n11:4:2:1919\\. He (Ayasthu _n_ a) said, 'Adhvaryu, thou hast insulted us; and\nthere now are those two spoons which, for a whole year, thou hast not been\nable to take up (in the proper manner): if I were to instruct thee in (the use\nof) them, thou wouldst become multiplied in offspring and cattle, and wouldst\nlead (the Sacrificer) to heaven.'\n\n11:4:2:2020\\. He said, 'Let me become thy pupil.' He answered, 'Even now,\nindeed, art thou worthy (of being instructed), who hast been our Adhvaryu for\na year: I will teach thee this even without thy\n\np. 62\n\nbecoming my pupil.' And so, indeed, he taught him that taking up of the two\nspoons as we have here explained it: hence one ought only to make one who\nknows this his Adhvaryu, and not one who does not know it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[56:2](sbe44022.htm#fr_206) At the time when the sacrificial food (havis) is\nto be placed on the Vedi, the two offering-spoons, _g_ uhu and upabh _ri_ t,\nare filled with ghee, and then placed, the former on the Prastara-bunch (lying\non the Vedi) with the bowl towards the east, and the latter north of it on the\ngrass-cover of the Vedi; a third spoon, the dhruva, being again placed north\nof the upabh _ri_ t. The first libation of ghee (aghara) is made from the\ndipping-spoon (sruva); but when about p. 57 to make the second libation, as\nalso prior to each of the two butter-portions, to the first of the five fore-\nofferings, as well as before each of the chief offerings (when, however,\nportions of the respective sacrificial dishes are added to the ghee in the _g_\nuhu), the Adhvaryu takes up the two spoons in the manner mentioned, viz.\nholding them together with both hands so as to be parallel to each other, the\nbowl of the _g_ uhu being just above that of the upabh _ri_ t without touching\nit. While thus holding them he goes forward to the \xc3\x82havaniya, and, after the\nother necessary rites, pours the oblation from the _g_ uhu, over the spout of\nthe upabh _ri_ t, into the fire. At the fourth fore-offering the ghee\ncontained in the upabh _ri_ t is for the first time made use of, half of it\nbeing poured into the _g_ uhu for the last two fore-offerings, whilst the\nremainder is used for the after-offerings.\n\n[57:1](sbe44022.htm#fr_207) When the Adhvaryu betakes himself from his place\nbehind the Vedi (on which the sacrificial material is laid out) to the\n\xc3\x82havaniya p. 58 in order to perform an offering, he is to proceed in such a\nway as constantly to keep his left foot before the right one; whilst in\nreturning to his place he keeps the right foot before the left. Of the two\nways of procedure mentioned in the paragraph, the second way is thus the right\none.\n\n[58:1](sbe44022.htm#fr_208) Whilst the Adhvaryu is standing by the side of the\n\xc3\x82havaniya, ready to make the offering, he holds the spoons to his navel till\nthe. moment when he has to pour the oblation into the fire.\n\n[58:2](sbe44022.htm#fr_209) The Adhvaryu's call is 'o _m_ _s_ ravaya' (make\nhim hear!) whereupon the \xc3\x82gnidhra responds 'astu _s_ rausha _t_ ' (yea, may he\nhear!).\n\n[58:3](sbe44022.htm#fr_210) Viz. any one for whom he (the Adhvaryu) performs a\nsacrifice, p. 59 in case he (the priest) thinks he has not been treated\nliberally enough by his patron, or for some other reason.\n\n[61:1](sbe44022.htm#fr_211) Tasa _m_ sa _m_ t _ri_ ptanam ahutina _m_ bhoktaro\ndeva _h_ prita _h_ santo hira _n_ mayan hira _n_ yavikara _m_ _s_ _k_ amasan\nya _g_ amanaya datu _m_ yena purayante, Say.\n\n[61:2](sbe44022.htm#fr_212) Cf. I, 7, 2, 7-10; and part i, p. 192, note 1,\nwhere the procedure is explained.\n\n[61:3](sbe44022.htm#fr_213) One would expect an 'iti' here.\n\n[61:4](sbe44022.htm#fr_214) According to Saya _n_ a, Ayasthu _n_ a is the name\nof a _Ri_ shi.\n\n[61:5](sbe44022.htm#fr_215) Literally, 'house-lord' or householder--the title\nof the Sacrificer at sacrificial sessions.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 4, 3.
