'The he-goat is vigour 1,'--the he-goat he overtook by his\nvigour;--'gapless the metre,'--\n\np. 38\n\nthe gapless metre, doubtless, is the Ekapada: in the form of Ekapada (metre)\nthe goats indeed went forth (from Pra _g_ apati).\n\n8:2:4:22\\. 'The ram is vigour,'--the ram he overtook by his vigour;--'ample\nthe metre,'--the ample metre, doubtless, is the Dvipada: in the form of the\nDvipada the sheep indeed went forth.\n\n8:2:4:33\\. 'Man is vigour,'--the man he overtook by his vigour;--'slow the\nmetre,'--the slow metre, doubtless, is the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti: in the form of the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti\nthe men indeed went forth.\n\n8:2:4:44\\. 'The tiger is vigour,'--the tiger he overtook by his\nvigour;--'unassailable the metre,'--the unassailable metre, doubtless, is the\nVira _g_ , for the Vira _g_ is food, and food is unassailable; in the form of\nthe Vira _g_ the tigers indeed went forth.\n\n8:2:4:55\\. 'The lion is vigour,'--the lion he overtook by his vigour;--'the\ncovering the metre,'--the covering metre, doubtless, is the Ati _k_ _kh_\nandas, for that covers (includes) all metres: in the form of the Ati _k_ _kh_\nandas the lions indeed went forth. And so he places undefined metres along\nwith defined beasts.\n\n8:2:4:66\\. 'The ox is vigour,'--the ox he overtook by his vigour;--'the B _ri_\nhati the metre,'--in the form of the B _ri_ hati the oxen indeed went forth.\n\n8:2:4:77\\. 'The bull is vigour,'--the bull he overtook by his vigour;--'the\nKakubh the metre,'--in the form of the Kakubh the bulls indeed went forth.\n\n8:2:4:88\\. 'The steer is vigour,'--the steer he overtook by his vigour;--'the\nSatob _ri_ hati the metre,'--in the form of the Satob _ri_ hati the steers\nindeed went forth.\n\np. 39\n\n8:2:4:99\\. 'The bullock is vigour,'--the bullock he overtook by his\nvigour;--'the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti the metre,'--in the form of the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti the bullocks\nindeed went forth.\n\n8:2:4:1010\\. 'The milch cow is vigour,'--the milch cow he overtook by his\nvigour;--'the _G_ agati the metre,'--in the form of the _G_ agati the milch\ncows indeed went forth.\n\n8:2:4:1111\\. 'The calf of eighteen months is vigour,'--the calf of eighteen\nmonths he overtook by his vigour;--'the Trish _t_ ubh the metre,'--in the form\nof the Trish _t_ ubh the calves of eighteen months indeed went forth.\n\n8:2:4:1212\\. 'The two-year-old bull is vigour,'--the two-year-old bull he\novertook by his vigour;--'the Vira _g_ the metre,'--in the form of the Vira\n_g_ the two-year-old kine indeed went forth.\n\n8:2:4:1313\\. 'The bull of two years and a half is vigour,'--the bull of two\nyears and a half he overtook by his vigour;--'the Gayatri the metre,'--in the\nform of the Gayatri the kine of two years and a half indeed went forth.\n\n8:2:4:1414\\. 'The three-year-old bull is vigour,'--the three-year-old bull he\novertook by his vigour;--'the Ush _n_ ih the metre,'--in the form of the Ush\n_n_ ih the three-year-old kine indeed went forth.\n\n8:2:4:1515\\. 'The four-year-old bull is vigour,'--the four-year-old bull he\novertook by his vigour;--'the Anush _t_ ubh the metre,'--in the form of the\nAnush _t_ ubh the four-year-old kine indeed went forth.\n\n8:2:4:1616\\. These then are those very beasts which Pra _g_ apati overtook by\nhis vigour. The animal he (the priest) mentions first, then vigour, then the\n\np. 40\n\nmetre, for having hemmed them in with vigour and the metre, he put them into\nhimself, and made them his own; and in like manner does he (the sacrificer)\nnow hem them in with vigour and the metre, and put them into himself, and make\nthem his own.\n\n8:2:4:1717\\. Now that animal is the same as Agni: (as such) he is even now\nmade up whole and entire. Those (bricks) which he places in front are his\nhead; those on the right and left sides are his body, and those behind his\ntail.\n\n8:2:4:1818\\. He first lays down those in front, for of an animal that is born\nthe head is born first. Having then laid down those on the right (south) side,\nhe lays down those on the left (north) side, thinking, 'Together with its\nsides this body shall be born.' Then those behind, for of (the animal) that is\nborn the tail is born last.\n\n8:2:4:1919\\. The metres which are longest, and the animals which are biggest,\nhe puts in the middle: he thus makes the animal biggest towards the middle;\nwhence the animal is biggest towards the middle. And the animals which are the\nstrongest he puts on the right side: he thus makes the right side of an animal\nthe stronger; whence the right side of an animal is the stronger.\n\n8:2:4:2020\\. The fore and hind parts he makes smallest; for inasmuch as those\n(bricks in front) are only four in number 1, thereby they are the smallest;\nand inasmuch as here (at the back) he puts the smallest animals, thereby these\nare the smallest: he thus makes the fore and hind parts of an animal the\nsmallest, whence the fore and hind parts of an animal\n\np. 41\n\nare the smallest; and hence the animal rises and sits down by its fore and\nhind parts. He then lays down two Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a (bricks) in that corner 1:\nthe significance of them (will be explained) further on 2. He throws loose\nearth on the layer: the significance of this (will be explained) further on 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[37:1](sbe4310.htm#fr_93) Mahidhara, in accordance with the explanation added\nby the Brahma _n_ a to this and the corresponding formulas in the succeeding\nparagraphs, takes vayas' as a defective instrumental (vayasa). It is, however,\nvery doubtful whether such an interpretation of the formula was intended by\nthe author of the Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[40:1](sbe4310.htm#fr_94) See [p. 35](sbe4309.htm#page_35), note\n[2](sbe4309.htm#fn_90).\n\n[41:1](sbe4310.htm#fr_95) Whilst, in laying down the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ as of the\nfirst layer, he started from the right shoulder (or south-east corner) of the\naltar (see [p. 22](sbe4306.htm#page_22), note [1](sbe4307.htm#fn_73)), in this\nlayer he begins from the right hip (or south west-corner), filling up the\navailable spaces, in two turns, in sunwise fashion.\n\n[41:2](sbe4310.htm#fr_96) See VII, 7, 2, 4 seq.\n\n[41:3](sbe4310.htm#fr_97) See [VIII, 7, 3, 1](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:1) seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII. 3, 1.
