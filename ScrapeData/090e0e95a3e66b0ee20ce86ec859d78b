And as the record of others (viz. the Taittiriyaka) is not such as in the\npurusha-vidya (of the _Kh_ andogya), (the two purusha-vidyas are not to be\ncombined).\n\nIn the Rahasya-brahma _n_ a of the Ta _n_ _d_ ins and the Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gins (the _Kh_\nandogya) there is a vidya treating of man, in which man is fancifully\nidentified with the sacrifice, the three periods of his life with the three\nlibations, his hunger and so on, with the diksha, &c. And other particulars\nalso are mentioned there, such as formulas of prayer, use of mantras and so\non.--A similar fanciful assimilation of the sacrifice and man the\nTaittiriyakas exhibit, 'For him who knows thus the Self of the sacrifice is\nthe sacrificer, Faith is the wife of the sacrificer,' and so on (Taitt. \xc3\x82r. X,\n64).--The doubt here arises whether the particulars of the man-sacrifice given\nin the _Kh_ andogya are to be inserted in the Taittiriyaka or not.\n\nAgainst the view of the purvapakshin that they are so to be inserted because\nin both places we have a purusha-ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, we maintain that they are not\nto be inserted because the characteristics of the purusha-ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a of the\n_Kh_ andogas are not recognised in the Taittiriya-text. This the Sutra-kara\nexpresses by saying, 'As (the record of the followers of some _S_ akhas, viz.\nthe Ta _n_ _d_ ins and Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gins, is) in the purusha-vidya, not such is the\nrecord of others,' viz. the Taittiriyakas. For the latter exhibit an\nidentification of man with the sacrifice, in which the wife, the sacrificer,\nthe\n\np. 221\n\n[paragraph continues] Veda, the vedi, the sacrificial grass, the post, the\nbutter, the sacrificial animal, the priest, &c., are mentioned in succession;\nnone of which particulars are mentioned in the _Kh_ andogya. The use also to\nwhich the Taittiriyaka turns the three libations is different from the _Kh_\nandogya, And the few points in which the two texts agree, such as the\nidentification of the Avab _ri_ tha-ceremony with death, lose their\nsignificance side by side with the greater number of dissimilarities, and are\ntherefore not able to effect the recognition of the vidya.--Moreover the\nTaittiriyaka does not represent man as the sacrifice (as the _Kh_ andogya\ndoes); for the two genitives ('of him who thus knows' and 'of the sacrifice')\nare not co-ordinate, and the passage therefore cannot be construed to mean,\n'The knowing one who is the sacrifice, of him the Self is,' &c. For it cannot\nbe said that man is the sacrifice, in the literal sense of the word. 1 The two\ngenitives are rather to be taken in that way, that one qualifies the other,\n'The sacrifice of him who thus knows, of that sacrifice,' &c. For the\nconnexion of the sacrifice with man (which is expressed by the genitive, 'the\nsacrifice of him') is really and literally true; and to take a passage in its\nliteral meaning, if possible at all, is always preferable to having recourse\nto a secondary metaphorical meaning. 2 Moreover the words next following in\nthe Taittiriyaka-passage, 'the Self is the sacrificer,' declare that man\n(man's Self) is the sacrificer, and this again shows that man's relation to\nthe sacrifice is not that of co-ordination.  3 Moreover as the section\nbeginning with 'Of him who thus knows' forms an anuvada of something\npreviously established (and as such forms one vakya to which one sense only\nmust be ascribed), we must not bring about 'a split of the sentence' by\ninterpreting it as\n\np. 222\n\nteaching in the first place that man is the sacrifice, and in the second place\nthat the Self and the other beings enumerated are the sacrificer and so on.\nAnd as we see that the passage, 'Of him who thus knows,' &c., follows upon\nsome instruction about the knowledge of the Self coupled with sa _m_ nyasa, we\napprehend that the Taittiriyaka-chapter is not an independent vidya but merely\nsupplementary to the instruction previously given. In agreement with this\nconclusion we observe that the Taittiriyaka promises only one result for both\nchapters, viz. the one stated in the passage, 'He obtains the greatness of\nBrahman.'--On the other hand the text embodying the purusha-vidya in the _Kh_\nandogya is an independent text; for we see that an independent result is\nattached to it, viz. an increase of length of life, 'He who knows this lives\non to a hundred and sixteen years.'--Hence the particulars mentioned in the\npurusha-vidya of another _S_ akha, such as formulas of prayer, mantras and so\non, are not to be combined with the Taittiriya-text of the vidya.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[221:1](sbe38167.htm#fr_143) And therefore we are not warranted in taking the\ntwo genitives as co-ordinate, as otherwise they might be taken.\n\n[221:2](sbe38167.htm#fr_144) Which latter would be the case if we should take\nthe two genitives as co-ordinate and therefore expressing an imaginative\nidentification of the man and the sacrifice.\n\n[221:3](sbe38167.htm#fr_145) If man is the sacrificer he cannot be identified\nwith the sacrifice; he is rather the Lord of the sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 25](sbe38168.htm)\n\n"
