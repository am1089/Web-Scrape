If it be said that on account of the scriptural\n\np. 192\n\ndeclaration of the smallness (of the ether) (the Lord cannot be meant; we\nreply that) that has been explained (before).\n\nThe purvapakshin has remarked that the smallness of the ether stated by\nScripture ('In it is that small ether') does not agree with the highest Lord,\nthat it may however be predicated of the individual soul which (in another\npassage) is compared to the point of a goad. As that remark calls for a\nrefutation we point out that it has been refuted already, it having been shown\n--under I, 2, 7--that a relative smallness may be attributed to the Lord. The\nsame refutation is--as the Sutra points out--to be applied here also.--That\nsmallness is, moreover, contradicted by that scriptural passage which compares\n(the ether within the heart) with the known (universal) ether. ('As large as\nis this ether so large is the ether within the heart.')\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 22](sbe34091.htm)\n\n"
