Some of these saints, but not many, were scholars, and became\nteachers of ancient lore. Some, however, and we need not be surprised at it,\nturned out to be impostors and hypocrites, and brought disgrace on the whole\nprofession. We must not forget that formerly the status of a Sa _m_ nyasin\npresupposed a very serious discipline during the many years of the student and\nthe domestic life. Such discipline might generally be accepted as a warrant\nfor a well-controlled mind and as security against the propensity to self-\nindulgence, not quite uncommon even in the lives of so-called Saints. When\nthis security is removed, and when anybody at any time of life may proclaim\nhimself a Sa _m_ nyasin, the temptations even of a Saint are very much\nincreased. But that there were real Sa _m_ nyasins, and that there are even\nnow men who have completely shaken off the fetters of passion, who have\ndisciplined their body and subdued the imaginations of their mind to a\nperfectly marvellous extent, cannot be doubted. They are often called Yogins,\nas having exercised Yoga.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Ascetic Exercises or Yoga](rls06.htm)\n\n'
