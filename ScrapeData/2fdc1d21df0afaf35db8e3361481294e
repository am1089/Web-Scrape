Remain  \nPure from all spot, and thou shalt gain  \nA son whose arm shall take the life  \nOf Indra in the battle strife.  \nFor full a thousand years endure  \nFree from all stain, supremely pure;  \nThen shall thy son and mine appear,  \nWhom the three worlds shall serve with fear.'  \nThese words the glorious Kas'yap said,  \nThen gently stroked his consort's head,  \nBlessed her, and bade a kind adieu,  \nAnd turned him to his rites anew.  \nSoon as her lord had left her side,  \nHer bosom swelled with joy and pride.  \nShe sought the shade of holy boughs,  \nAnd there began her awful vows.  \nWhile yet she wrought her rites austere,  \nIndra, unbidden, hastened near,  \nWith sweet observance tending her,  \nA reverential minister.  \nWood, water, fire, and grass he brought,  \nSweet roots and woodland fruit he sought,  \nAnd all her wants, the Thousand-eyed,  \nWith never-failing care, supplied,  \nWith tender love and soft caress  \nRemoving pain and weariness.  \n\nWhen, of the thousand years ordained,  \nTen only unfulfilled remained,  \nThus to her son, the Thousand-eyed,  \nThe Goddess in her triumph cried:  \n'Best of the mighty! there remain  \nBut ten short years of toil and pain;  \nThese years of penance soon will flee,  \nAnd a new brother thou shalt see.  \nHim for thy sake I'll nobly breed,  \nAnd lust of war his soul shall feed;  \nThen free from care and sorrow thou  \nShalt see the worlds before him bow.'

The similarity to the Greek myth of Venus being born\nfrom the foam of the sea is remarkable.'\n\n'In this description of Lakshmi one thing only offends me, that she is said to\nhave four arms. Each of Vishnu's arms, single, as far as the elbow, there\nbranches into two; but Lakshmi in all the brass seals that I possess or\nremember to have seen has two arms only. Nor does this deformity of redundant\nlimbs suit the pattern of perfect beauty.' SCHLEGEL. I have omitted the\noffensive epithet.\n\n[58:2b](ry045.htm#fr_211) Purandhar, a common title of Indra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XLVII.: Sumati.](ry047.htm)\n\n"
