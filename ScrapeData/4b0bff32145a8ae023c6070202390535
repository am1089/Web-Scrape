Reflecting he went to Bhugwan, and implored him most earnestly:\nfalling at his feet, soliciting and standing before him with joined hands, he\nbegan to say, "O lord! you have done me a great kindness in having removed my\npride, by which I had been blinded; who has understanding sufficient to\ncomprehend your actions, unless you take compassion upon him? Your illusory\npower has fascinated all; who is there with powers to fascinate you? You are\nthe god of all; in every hair of your body there are many Bruhmus like me: in\nwhat reckoning am I? O kind to the poor! be pleased now compassionately to\nforgive my offence, and take not thought of my fault."\n\nHaving heard thus much, Shree Krishnu smiled: Bruhmu then brought all the\ncowherds\' children and the calves in a state of sleep: and being ashamed, and\noffering praises to Krishnu, went to his own abode. The assembly was formed\nexactly as it was before: although a year had passed, no one was aware of it.\nWhen the cowherds\' children awoke, Krishnu collected the calves. Upon this,\nsome of the children said,\n\np. 57\n\n[paragraph continues] "Brother! you have brought the calves quickly; we have\nnot had time to eat our food."\n\nHearing this, Krishnu said laughing, "I was anxious on your account--I found\nthe calves, grazing near in one place; let us now go home, having come here\nvery early in the morning." Conversing thus, and taking the calves with them,\nthey all came home, laughing and playing.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVI](psa17.htm)\n\n'
