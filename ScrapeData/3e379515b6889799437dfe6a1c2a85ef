And on account of the words expressive of becoming.\n\nMoreover the text exhibits words of clearly injunctive meaning, in connexion\nwith the passages quoted above, viz. 'Let him meditate on the udgitha' ( _Kh_.\nUp. I, 1, 1); 'Let him meditate on the Saman' ( _Kh_. Up. II, 2, 1); 'Let him\nthink: I am the hymn' (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 1, 6). Now these injunctive forms would be\nrendered futile by the assumption of the texts under discussion aiming at\nglorification only. Compare the following saying of those who know Nyaya, 'Let\nhim do, let it be done, it is to be done, let it become, let it be; these\nforms are in all Vedas the settled signs of injunction.' What they mean\nthereby is that injunction is the sense of all potential, imperative, &c.,\nverbal forms.--Moreover in each of the sections to which the passages under\ndiscussion belong the text states special fruits, 'He becomes indeed a\nfulfiller of desires' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 1, 7); 'He is able to obtain wishes\nthrough his song' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 7, 9); 'The worlds in an ascending and a\ndescending line belong to him' ( _Kh_. Up. II, 2, 3). For this reason also the\ntexts\n\np. 305\n\nabout the udgitha and so on are meant to enjoin devout meditations.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 23](sbe38232.htm)\n\n"
