 \nHow is it with my darling when  \nFrom the deep tangles of the glen  \nFloat carols of each bird elate  \nWith rapture singing to his mate?  \nIn vain my weary glances rove  \nFrom lake to hill, from stream to grove:  \nI find no rapture in the scene,  \nAnd languish fur my fawn-eyed queen.  \nAh, does strong love with wild unrest,  \nBorn no the autumn, stir her breast?  \nAnd does the gentle lady pine  \nTill her bright eyes shall look in mine?'  \n   Thus Raghu's son in piteous tone,  \nO'erwhelmed with sorrow, made his moan.  \nE'en as the bird that drinks the rains  1  \nTo Indra thousand-eyed complains.  \nThen Lakshman who had wandered through  \nThe copses where the berries grew,  \nReturning to the cavern found  \nHis brother chief* in sorrow drowned,  \nAnd pitying the woes that broke  \nThe spirit, of the hero spoke:  \n   'Why east thy strength of soul away,  \nAnd weakly yield to passion's sway?  \nArise, my brother, do and dare  \nEre action perish in despair.  \nRefill the firmness of thy heart,  \nAnd nerve thee for a hero's part.  \nWhose is the hand unscathed to sieze  \nThe red flame quickened by the breeze?  \nWhere is the foe will dare to wrong  \nOr keep the Maithil lady long?'  \nThen with pale lips that sorrow dried  \nThe son of Raghu thus replied:  \nLord Indra thousand-eyed, has sent  \nThe sweet rain from the firmament,  \nSees the rich promise of the grain,  \nAnd turns him to his rest again.  \nThe clouds with voices loud and deep,  \nVeiling each tree upon the steep,  \nUp on the thirsty earth have shed  \nTheir precious burden and are fled.  \n\nNow in kings' hearts ambition glows:  \nThey rush to battle with their foes; 1b  \nBut in Sugriva's sloth I see  \nNo care for deeds of chivalry.  \nSee, Lakshman, on each breezy height  \nA thousand autumn blooms are bright.  \nSee how the wings of wild swans gleam  \nOn every islet of the stream.  \nFour months of flood and rain are past:  \nA hundred years they seemed to last  \nTo me whom toil and trouble tried,  \nMy Sita severed from my side.  \nShe, gentlest woman, weak and young,  \nStill to her lord unwearied clung.  \nStill by the exile's side she stood  \nIn the wild ways of Dandak wood,  \nLike a fond bird disconsolate  \nIf parted from her darling mate.  \nSugriva, lapped in soft repose.  \nUntouched by pity for my woes,  \nScorns the poor exile, dispossessed,  \nBy Ravan's mightier arm oppressed,  \nThe wretch who comes to sue and pray  \nFrom his lost kingdom far away.  \nHence falls on me the Vanar's scorn,  \nA suitor friendless and forlorn.  \nThe time is come: with heedless eye  \nHe sees the hour of action fly,--  \nUnmindful, now his hopes succeed,  \nOf promise made in stress of need.  \nGo seek him sunk in bliss and sloth,  \nForgetful of his royal oath,  \nAnd as mine envoy thus upbraid  \nThe monarch for his help delayed:  \n'Vile is the wretch who will not pay  \nThe favour of an earlier day,  \nHope in the supplicant's breast awakes,  \nAnd then his plighted promise breaks.  \nNoblest, mid all of women born,  \nWho keeps the words his lips have sworn.  \nYea, if those words be good or ill.  \nMaintains his faith unbroken still.  \nThe *ss who forget to aid  \nThe friend who helped them when they prayed,  \nDishonoured in their death shall lie,  \nAnd dogs shall pass their corpses by.  \nSure thou wouldst see my strained arm hold  \nMy bow of battle backed with gold,  \nWouldst gaze upon its awful from  \nLike lightning flashing through the storm,  \nAnd hear the clanging bowstring loud  \nAs thunder from a labouring cloud  \n   His valour and his strength I know:  \nBut pleasure's sway now sinks them low  \nWith thee, my brother, for ally  \nThat strength and valour I defy  \n\np. 362  \n\nHe promised, when the rains should end,  \nThe succour of his arm to lend.  \nThose months are past: he dares forget.  \nAnd, lapped in pleasure, slumbers yet.  \nNo thought disturbs his careless breast  \nFor us impatient and distressed.  \nAnd, while we sadly wait and pine,  \nGirt by his lords he quaffs the wine.  \nGo, brother, go, his palace seek,  \nAnd boldly to Sugriva speak.  \nThus give the listless king to know  \nWhat waits him if my anger glow:  \nStill open, to the gloomy God,  \nLies the sad path that Bali trod.  \n'Still to thy plighted word be true,  \nLest thou, O King, that path pursue.  \nI launched the shaft I pointed well.  \nAnd Bali, only Bali, fell.  \nBut, if from truth thou dare to stray,  \nBoth thee and thine this hand shall slay.'  \nThus be the Vanar king addressed,  \nThen add thyself what seems the best.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[360:1](ry303.htm#fr_632) The troops who guard the frontiers on the north,\nsouth, east and west.\n\n[361:1](ry304.htm#fr_633) The _Ch atake, Cualus Melanoleucus_, is supposed to\ndrink nothing but the water for the clouds.\n\n[361:1b](ry304.htm#fr_634) The time for warlike expeditions began when the\nrains had ceased.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXI.: The Envoy.](ry305.htm)\n\n"
