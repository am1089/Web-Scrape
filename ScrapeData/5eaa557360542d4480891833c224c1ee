Blest is she,  \nThe Mother of a son like thee.  \nNow rise, O Rama, speed away.  \nGo to thy sire without delay:  \nFor he and Queen Kaikeyi seek  \nAn interview with thee to speak.'  \n\nThe lion-lord of men, the best  \nOf splendid heroes, thus addressed,  \nTo Sita spake with joyful cheer:  \n'The king and qneen, my lady dear,  \nTouching the throning, for my sake  \nSome salutary counsel take.  \nThe lady ot the full black eye  \nWould fain her husband gratify,  \nAnd, all his purpose understood,  \nCounsels the monarch to my good.  \nA happy fate is mine, I ween,  \nWhen he, consulting with his queen,  \nSumantra on this charge, intent  \nUpon my gain and good, has sent.  \nAn envoy of so noble sort  \nWell suits the splendour of the court.  \nThe consecration rite this day  \nWill join me in imperial sway.  \nTo meet the lord of earth, for so  \nHis order bids me, I will go.  \nThou, lady, here in comfort stay,  \nAnd with thy maidens rest or play.'  \n\nThus Rama spake. For meet reply  \nThe lady of the large black eye  \nAttended to the door her lord,  \nAnd blessings on his head implored:  \n'The majesty and royal state  \nWhich holy Brahmans venerate,  \nThe consecration and the rite  \nWhich sanctifies the ruler's might,  \nAnd all imperial powers should be  \nThine by thy father's high decree,  \nAs He, the worlds who formed and planned,  \nThe kingship gave to Indra's hand.  \n\np. 112  \n\nThen shall mine eyes my king adore  \nWhen lustral rites and fast are o'er,  \nAnd black deer's skin and roebuck's horn  \nThy lordly limbs and hand adorn.  \nMay He whose hands the thunder wield  \nBe in the east thy guard and shield;  \nMay Yama's care the south befriend,  \nAnd Varun's arm the west defend;  \nAnd let Kuvera, Lord of Gold,  \nThe north with firm protection hold.'  \n\nThen Rama spoke a kind farewell,  \nAnd hailed the blessings as they fell  \nFrom Sita's gentle lips; and then,  \nAs a young lion from his den  \nDescends the mountain's stony side,  \nSo from the hall the hero hied.  \nFirst Lakshman at the door he viewed  \nWho stood in reverent attitude,  \nThen to the central court he pressed  \nWhere watched the friends who loved him best.  \nTo all his dear companions there  \nHe gave kind looks and greeting fair.  \nOn to the lofty car that glowed  \nLike fire the royal tiger strode.  \nBright as himself its silver shone:  \nA tiger's skin was laid thereon.  \nWith cloudlike thunder, as it rolled,  \nIt flashed with gems and burnished gold,  \nAnd, like the sun's meridian blaze,  \nBlinded the eye that none could gaze.  \nLike youthful elephants, tall and strong,  \nFleet coursers whirled the car along:  \nIn such a car the Thousand-eyed  \nBorne by swift horses loves to ride.  \nSo like Parjanya,  1 when he flies  \nThundering through the autumn skies,  \nThe hero from the palace sped,  \nAs leaves the moon some cloud o'erhead.  \nStill close to Rama Lakshman kept,  \nBehind him to the car he leapt,  \nAnd, watching with fraternal care,  \nWaved the long chouri's silver hair,  \nAs from the palace gate he came  \nUp rose the tumult of acclaim.  \nWhile loud huzza and jubilant shout  \nPealed from the gathered myriads out.  \nThen elephants, like mountains vast,  \nAnd steeds who all their kind surpassed,  \nFollowed their lord by hundreds, nay  \nBy thousands, led in long array.  \nFirst marched a band of warriors trained,  \nWith sandal dust and aloe stained;  \nWell armed was each with sword and bow,  \nAnd every breast with hope aglow,  \nAnd ever, as they onward went,  \n   Shouts from the warrior train,  \nAnd every sweet-toned instrument  \n   Prolonged the minstrel strain.  \n\nOn passed the tamer of his foes,  \nWhile well clad dames, in crowded rows,  \nEach chamber lattice thronged to view,  \nAnd chaplets on the hero threw.  \nThen all, of peerless face and limb,  \nSang Rama's praise for love of him,  \nAnd blent their voices, soft and sweet.  \nFrom palace high and crowded street:  \n'Now, sure, Kaus'alya's heart must swell  \nTo see the son she loves so well,  \nThee Rama, thee, her joy and pride,  \nTriumphant o'er the realm preside.'  \nThen--for they knew his bride most fair  \nOf all who part the soft dark hair,  \nHis love, his life, possessed the whole  \nOf her young hero's heart and soul:--  \n'Be sure the lady's fate repays  \nSome mighty vow of ancient days,  [1b](ry095.htm#fn_283)  \nFor blest with Rama's love is she  \nAs, with the Moon's, sweet Rohini.'  [2b](ry095.htm#fn_284)  \n\nSuch were the witching words that came  \nFrom lips of many a peerless dame  \nCrowding the palace roofs to greet  \nThe hero as he gained the street.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[111:1](ry094.htm#fr_281) A star in the spike of Virgo: hence the name of the\nmouth Chaitra at Chait.\n\n[112:1](ry094.htm#fr_282) The Rain-God.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XVII.: Rama's Approach.](ry095.htm)\n\n"
