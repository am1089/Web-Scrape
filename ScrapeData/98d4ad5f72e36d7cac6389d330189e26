On account of the connected meaning of the sentences.\n\nIn spite of the conclusion arrived at there may remain a suspicion that here\nand there in the Upanishads texts are to be met with which aim at setting\nforth the soul as maintained in Kapila's system, and that hence there is no\nroom for a being different from the individual soul and called Lord. This\nsuspicion the Sutra undertakes to remove, in connexion with the Maitreyi-\nbrahma _n_ a, in the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka. There we read 'Verily, a husband\nis dear, not for the love of the husband, but for the love of the Self a\nhusband is dear, and so on. Everything is dear, not for the love of\neverything, but for the love of the Self everything is dear. The Self should\nbe seen, should be heard, should be reflected on, should be meditated upon.\nWhen the Self has been seen, heard, reflected upon, meditated upon, then all\nthis is known' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 6).--Here the doubt arises whether the Self\nenjoined in this passage as the object of seeing, &c., be the soul as held by\nthe Sa _n_ khyas, or the Supreme Lord, all-knowing, capable of realising all\nhis purposes, and so on. The Purvapakshin upholds the former alternative. For,\nhe says, the beginning no less than the middle and the concluding part of the\nsection conveys the idea of the individual soul only. In the beginning the\nindividual soul only is meant, as appears from the connexion of the Self with\nhusband, wife, children, wealth, cattle, and so on. This is confirmed by the\nmiddle part of the section where the Self is said to be connected with\norigination and destruction, 'a mass of knowledge, he having risen from these\nelements vanishes again into them. When he has departed there\n\np. 386\n\nis no more consciousness.' And in the end we have 'whereby should he know the\nknower'; where we again recognise the knowing subject, i.e. the individual\nsoul, not the Lord. We thus conclude that the whole text is meant to set forth\nthe soul as held by the Sa _n_ khyas.--But in the beginning there is a clause,\nviz. 'There is no hope of immortality by wealth,' which shows that the whole\nsection is meant to instruct us as to the means of immortality; how then can\nit be meant to set forth the individual soul only?--You state the very reason\nproving that the text is concerned with the individual soul only! For\naccording to the Sa _n_ khya-system immortality is obtained through the\ncognition of the true nature of the soul viewed as free from all erroneous\nimputation to itself of the attributes of non-sentient matter; and the text\ntherefore makes it its task to set forth, for the purpose of immortality, the\nessential nature of the soul free from all connexion with Prak _ri_ ti, 'the\n_Self_ should be heard,' and so on. And as the souls dissociated from Prak\n_ri_ ti are all of a uniform nature, all souls are known through the knowledge\nof the soul free from Prak _ri_ ti, and the text therefore rightly says that\nthrough the Self being known everything is known. And as the essential nature\nof the Self is of one and the same kind, viz. knowledge or intelligence, in\nall beings from gods down to plants, the text rightly asserts the unity of the\nSelf 'that Self is all this'; and denies all otherness from the Self, on the\nground of the characteristic attributes of gods and so on really being of the\nnature of the Not-self, 'he is abandoned by everything,' &c. The clause, 'For\nwhere there is duality as it were,' which denies plurality, intimates that the\nplurality introduced into the homogeneous Self by the different forms--such as\nof gods, and so on--assumed by Prak _ri_ ti, is false. And there is also no\nobjection to the teaching that 'the _Ri_ g-veda and so on are breathed forth\nfrom that great being (i.e. Prak _ri_ ti); for the origination of the world is\ncaused by the soul in its quality as ruler of Prak _ri_ ti.--It thus being\nascertained that the whole Maitreyi-brahma _n_ a is concerned with the soul in\nthe Sa _n_ khya sense, we, according to the principle of the\n\np. 387\n\nunity of purport of all Vedanta-texts, conclude that they all treat of the Sa\n_n_ khya soul only, and that hence the cause of the world is to be found not\nin a so-called Lord but in Prak _ri_ ti ruled and guided by the soul.\n\nThis prima facie view is set aside by the Sutra. The whole text refers to the\nSupreme Lord only; for on this supposition only a satisfactory connexion of\nthe parts of the text can be made out. On being told by Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya that\nthere is no hope of immortality through wealth, Maitreyi expresses her slight\nregard for wealth and all such things as do not help to immortality, and asks\nto be instructed as to the means of immortality only ('What should I do with\nthat by which I do not become immortal? What my lord knows tell that clearly\nto me'). Now the Self which Ya _g \xc3\xb1_avalkya, responding to her requests,\npoints out to her as the proper object of knowledge, can be none other than\nthe highest Self; for other scriptural texts clearly teach that the only means\nof reaching immortality is to know the Supreme Person--'Having known him thus\nman passes beyond death'; 'Knowing him thus he becomes immortal here, there is\nno other path to go' ( _S_ vet. Up. III, 8). The knowledge of the true nature\nof the individual soul which obtains immortality, and is a mere manifestation\nof the power of the Supreme Person, must be held to be useful towards the\ncognition of the Supreme Person who brings about Release, but is not in itself\ninstrumental towards such Release; the being the knowledge of which the text\ndeclares to be the means of immortality is therefore the highest Self only.\nAgain, the causal power with regard to the entire world which is expressed in\nthe passage, 'from that great Being there were breathed forth the _Ri_ g\nveda,' &c., cannot possibly belong to the mere individual soul which in its\nstate of bondage is under the influence of karman and in the state of release\nhas nothing to do with the world; it can in fact belong to the Supreme Person\nonly. Again, what the text says as to everything being known by the knowledge\nof one thing ('By the seeing indeed of the Self,' &c.) is possible only in the\ncase of a Supreme Self which constitutes the Self of all. What\n\np. 388\n\nthe Purvapakshin said as to everything being known through the cognition of\nthe one individual soul, since all individual souls are of the same type--this\nalso cannot be upheld; for as long as there is a knowledge of the soul only\nand not also of the world of non-sentient things, there is no knowledge of\neverything. And when the text enumerates different things ('this Brahman\nclass, this Kshatra class,' &c.), and then concludes 'all this is that Self--\nwhere the 'this' denotes the entire Universe of animate and inanimate beings\nas known through Perception, Inference, and so on--universal unity such as\ndeclared here is possible only through a highest Self which is the Self of\nall. It is not, on the other hand, possible that what the word 'this' denotes,\ni.e. the whole world of intelligent and non-intelligent creatures, should be\none with the personal soul as long as it remains what it is, whether connected\nwith or disassociated from non-sentient matter. In the same spirit the\npassage, 'All things abandon him who views all things elsewhere than in the\nSelf,' finds fault with him who views anything apart from the universal Self.\nThe qualities also which in the earlier Maitreyi-brahma _n_ a (II, 4, 12) are\npredicated of the being under discussion, viz. greatness, endlessness,\nunlimitedness, cannot belong to any one else but the highest Self. That Self\ntherefore is the topic of the Brahma _n_ a.\n\nWe further demur to our antagonist's maintaining that the entire Brahma _n_ a\ntreats of the individual soul because that soul is at the outset represented\nas the object of enquiry, this being inferred from its connexion with husband,\nwife, wealth, &c. For if the clause 'for the love (literally, _for the desire_\n) of the Self refers to the individual Self, we cannot help connecting (as, in\nfact, we must do in any case) that Self with the Self referred to in the\nsubsequent clause, 'the Self indeed is to be seen,' &c.; the connexion having\nto be conceived in that way that the information given in the former clause\nsomehow subserves the cognition of the Self enjoined in the latter clause.\n'For the desire of the Self would then mean 'for the attainment of the objects\ndesired by the Self.' But if it\n\np. 389\n\nis first said that husband, wife, &c., are dear because they fulfil the wishes\nof the individual Self, it could hardly be said further on that the nature of\nthat Self must be enquired into; for what, in the circumstances of the case,\nnaturally is to be enquired into and searched for are the dear objects but not\nthe true nature of him to whom those objects are dear, apart from the objects\nthemselves. It would certainly be somewhat senseless to declare that since\nhusband, wife, &c., are dear because they fulfil the desires of the individual\nsoul, therefore, setting aside those dear objects, we must enquire into the\ntrue nature of that soul apart from all the objects of its desire. On the\ncontrary, it having been declared that husband, wife, &c., are dear not on\naccount of husband, wife, &c., but on account of the Self, they should not be\ndropped, but included in the further investigation, just because they subserve\nthe Self. And should our opponent (in order to avoid the difficulty of\nestablishing a satisfactory connexion between the different clauses) maintain\nthat the clause, 'but everything is dear for the love of the Self,' is not\nconnected with the following clause, 'the Self is to be seen,' &c., we point\nout that this would break the whole connexion of the Brahma _n_ a. And if we\nallowed such a break, we should then be unable to point out what is the use of\nthe earlier part of the Brahma _n_ a. We must therefore attempt to explain the\nconnexion in such a way as to make it clear why all search for dear objects--\nhusband, wife, children, wealth, &c.--should be abandoned and the Self only\nshould be searched for. This explanation is as follows. After having stated\nthat wealth, and so on, are no means to obtain immortality which consists in\npermanent absolute bliss, the text declares that the pleasant experiences\nwhich we derive from wealth, husband, wife, &c.. and which are not of a\npermanent nature and always alloyed with a great deal of pain, are caused not\nby wealth, husband, wife, &c., themselves, but rather by the highest Self\nwhose nature is absolute bliss. He therefore who being himself of the nature\nof perfect bliss causes other beings and things also to be the abodes of\npartial bliss, he--the highest Self--is to be constituted\n\np. 390\n\nthe object of knowledge. The clauses, 'not for the wish of the husband a\nhusband is dear,' &c., therefore must be understood as follows--a husband, a\nwife, a son, &c., are not dear to us in consequence of a wish or purpose on\ntheir part, 'may I, for my own end or advantage be dear to him,' but they are\ndear to us for the wish of the Self, i.e. to the end that there may be\naccomplished the desire of the highest Self--which desire aims at the devotee\nobtaining what is dear to him. For the highest Self pleased with the works of\nhis devotees imparts to different things such dearness, i.e. joy-giving\nquality as corresponds to those works, that 'dearness' being bound in each\ncase to a definite place, time, nature and degree. This is in accordance with\nthe scriptural text, 'For he alone bestows bliss' (Taitt. Up. II, 7). Things\nare not dear, or the contrary, to us by themselves, but only in so far as the\nhighest Self makes them such. Compare the text, 'The same thing which erst\ngave us delight later on becomes the source of grief; and what was the cause\nof wrath afterwards tends to peace. Hence there is nothing that in itself is\nof the nature either of pleasure or of pain.'\n\nBut, another view of the meaning of the text is proposed, even if the Self in\nthe clause 'for the desire of the Self' were accepted as denoting the\nindividual Self, yet the clause 'the Self must be seen' would refer to the\nhighest Self only. For in that case also the sense would be as follows--\nbecause the possession of husband, wife, and other so-called dear things is\naimed at by a person to whom they are dear, not with a view of bringing about\nwhat is desired by them (viz. husband, wife, &c.), but rather to the end of\nbringing about what is desired by himself; therefore that being which is, to\nthe individual soul, absolutely and unlimitedly dear, viz. the highest Self,\nmust be constituted the sole object of cognition, not such objects as husband,\nwife, wealth, &c., the nature of which depends on various external\ncircumstances and the possession of which gives rise either to limited\npleasure alloyed with pain or to mere pain.--But against this we remark that\nas, in the section under discussion, the words designating the\n\np. 391\n\nindividual Self denote the highest Self also, [1](sbe48162.htm#fn_35), the\nterm 'Self' in both clauses, 'For the desire of the Self' and 'The Self is to\nbe seen,' really refers to one and the same being (viz. the highest Self), and\nthe interpretation thus agrees with the one given above.--In order to prove\nthe tenet that words denoting the individual soul at the same time denote the\nhighest Self, by means of arguments made use of by other teachers also, the\nSutrakara sets forth the two following Sutras.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 20.
