 \nAnd all thy stars shall ever fling  \nTheir rays attendant on the king.' 1  \n\nThe mighty saint, with glory crowned,  \nWith all the sages compassed round,  \nPraised by the Gods, gave full assent,  \nAnd Gods and sages homeward went.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[72:1](ry060.htm#fr_239) 'The seven ancient rishis or saints, as has been said\nbefore, were the seven stars of Ursa Major. The seven other new saints which\nare here said to have been created by Vis'vamitra, should be seven new\nsouthern stars, a sort of new Ursa. Von Schlegel thinks that this mythical\nfiction of new stars created by Vis'vamitra may signify that these southern\nstars, unknown to the Indians as long as they remained in the neighbourhood of\nthe Ganges, became known to them at a later date when they colonized the\nsouthern regions of Indra.'
