XVIII.\n\nHiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu\'s reiterated attempts to destroy his son: their being always\nfrustrated.\n\nTHE Danavas, observing the conduct of Prahlada, reported it to the king, lest\nthey should incur his displeasure. He sent for his cooks, and said to them,\n"My vile and unprincipled son is now teaching others his impious doctrines: be\nquick, and put an end to him. Let deadly poison be mixed up with all his\nviands, without his knowledge. Hesitate not, but destroy the wretch without\ndelay." Accordingly they did so, and administered poison to the virtuous\nPrahlada, as his father had commanded them. Prahlada, repeating the name of\nthe imperishable, ate and digested the food in which the deadly poison had\nbeen infused, and suffered no harm from it, either in body or mind, for it had\nbeen rendered innocuous by the name of the eternal. Beholding the strong\npoison digested, those who had prepared the food were filled with dismay, and\nhastened to the king, and fell down before him, and said, "King of the\nDaityas, the fearful poison given by us to your son has been digested by him\nalong with his food, as if it were innocent. Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu, on hearing this,\nexclaimed, "Hasten, hasten, ministrant priests of the Daitya race! instantly\nperform the rites that will effect his destruction!" Then the priests went to\nPrahlada, and, having repeated the hymns of the Sama-Veda, said to him, as he\nrespectfully hearkened, "Thou hast been born, prince, in the family of Brahma,\ncelebrated in the three worlds, the son of Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu, the king of the\nDaityas; why shouldest thou acknowledge dependance upon the gods? why upon the\neternal? Thy father is the stay of all the worlds, as thou thyself in turn\nshalt be. Desist, then, from celebrating the praises of an enemy; and\nremember, that of all venerable preceptors, a father is most venerable."\nPrahlada replied to them, "Illustrious Brahmans, it is true that the family of\nMarichi is renowned in the three worlds; this cannot be denied: and I also\nadmit, what is equally indisputable, that my father is mighty over the\nuniverse. There is no error, not the least, in what you have said, \'that a\nfather is the most venerable of all holy teachers:\' he is a venerable\ninstructor, no doubt, and is ever to be devoutly reverenced. To all\n\np. 135\n\nthese things I have nothing to object; they find a ready assent in my mind:\nbut when you say, \'Why should I depend upon the eternal?\' who can give assent\nto this as right? the words are void of meaning." Having said thus much, he\nwas silent a while, being restrained by respect to their sacred functions; but\nhe was unable to repress his smiles, and again said, "What need is there of\nthe eternal? excellent! What need of the eternal? admirable! most worthy of\nyou who are my venerable preceptors! Hear what need there is of the eternal,\nif to hearken will not give you pain. The fourfold objects of men are said to\nbe virtue, desire, wealth, final emancipation. Is he who is the source of all\nthese of no avail? Virtue was derived from the eternal by Daksha, Marichi, and\nother patriarchs; wealth has been obtained front him by others; and by others,\nthe enjoyment of their desires: whilst those who, through true. wisdom and\nholy contemplation, have come to know his essence, have been released from\ntheir bondage, and have attained freedom from existence for ever. The\nglorification of Hari, attainable by unity, is the root of all riches,\ndignity, renown, wisdom, progeny, righteousness, and liberation. Virtue,\nwealth, desire, and even final freedom, Brahmans, are fruits bestowed by him.\nHow then can it be said, \'What need is there of the eternal?\' But enough of\nthis: what occasion is there to say more? You are my venerable preceptors,\nand, speak ye good or evil, it is not for my weak judgment to decide." The\npriests said to him, "We preserved you, boy, when you were about to be\nconsumed by fire, confiding that you would no longer eulogize your father\'s\nfoes: we knew not how unwise you were: but if you will not desist from this\ninfatuation at our advice, we shall even proceed to perform the rites that\nwill inevitably destroy you." To this menace, Prahlada answered, "What living\ncreature slays, or is slain? what living creature preserves, or is preserved?\nEach is his own destroyer or preserver, as he follows evil or good 1."\n\np. 136\n\nThus spoken to by the youth, the priests of the Daitya sovereign were\nincensed, and instantly had recourse to magic incantations, by which a female\nform, enwreathed with fiery flame, was engendered: she was of fearful aspect,\nand the earth was parched beneath her tread, as she approached Prahlada, and\nsmote him with a fiery trident on the breast. In vain! for the weapon fell,\nbroken into a hundred pieces, upon the ground. Against the breast in which the\nimperishable Hari resides the thunderbolt would be shivered, much more should\nsuch a weapon be split in pieces. The magic being, then directed against the\nvirtuous prince by the wicked priest, turned upon them, and, having quickly\ndestroyed them, disappeared. But Prahlada, beholding them perish, hastily\nappealed to Krishn\xcc\x81a, the eternal, for succour, and said, "Oh Janarddana! who\nart every where, the creator and substance of the world, preserve these\nBrahmans from this magical and insupportable fire. As thou art Vishn\xcc\x81u,\npresent in all creatures, and the protector of the world, so let these priests\nbe restored to life. If, whilst devoted to the omnipresent Vishn\xcc\x81u, I think no\nsinful resentment against my foes, let these priests be restored to life. If\nthose who have come to slay me, those by whom poison was given me, the fire\nthat would have burned, the elephants that would have crushed, and snakes that\nwould have stung me, have been regarded by me as friends; if I have been\nunshaken in soul, and am without fault in thy sight; then, I implore thee, let\nthese, the priests of the Asuras, be now restored to life." Thus having\nprayed, the Brahmans immediately rose up, uninjured and rejoicing; and bowing\nrespectfully to Prahlada, they blessed him, and said, "Excellent prince, may\nthy days be many; irresistible be thy prowess; and power and wealth and\nposterity be thine." Having thus spoken, they withdrew, and went and told the\nking of the Daityas all that had passed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[135:1](vp053.htm#fr_315) This is not the doctrine of the impassibility of\nsoul, taught in the Vedas: \'We do not recognise either the doctrine that\nsupposes the slayer to slay, or the slain to be killed; this (spiritual\nexistence) neither kills nor is killed.\' The same is inculcated at great\nlength, and with great beauty, in the Bhagavat Gita: \'Weapons wound it not;\nfire doth not p. 136 consume it; water cannot drown it; nor doth it wither\nbefore the winds:\' or, as rendered by Schlegel, \'Non ilium penetrant tela; non\nilium comburit flamma; neque illum perfundunt aquae; nec ventus exsiccat.\' P.\n17. new edition. But in the passage of our text, all that the Hindus\nunderstand of Fate, is referred to. Death or immunity, prosperity or\nadversity, are in this life the inevitable consequences of conduct in a prior\nexistence: no man can suffer a penalty which his vices in a preceding state of\nbeing have not incurred, nor can he avoid it if they have.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIX](vp054.htm)\n\n'
