Pra _g_ apati desired, 'Would that I might gain both worlds, the\nworld of the gods, and the world of men.' He saw those beasts, the tame and\nthe wild ones; he seized them, and by means of them took possession of these\ntwo worlds: by means of the tame beasts he took possession of this\n(terrestrial) world, and by means of the wild beasts of yonder (world); for\nthis world is the world of men, and yonder world is the world of the gods.\nThus when he seizes tame beasts he thereby takes possession of this world, and\nwhen wild beasts, he thereby (takes possession) of yonder (world).\n\n13:2:4:22\\. Were he to complete (the sacrifice) with tame ones, the roads\nwould run together 3, the village-boundaries\n\np. 307\n\nof two villages would be contiguous 1, and no ogres 2, man-tigers, thieves,\nmurderers, and robbers would come to be in the forests. By (so doing) with\nwild (beasts) the roads would run asunder 3, the village-boundaries of two\nvillages would be far asunder 4; and there would come to be ogres, man-tigers,\nthieves, murderers, and robbers in the forests.\n\n13:2:4:33\\. As to this they say, 'Surely that--to wit, the forest (beast)--is\nnot a beast (or cattle), and offering should not be made thereof: were he to\nmake offering thereof, they would ere long carry away the Sacrificer dead to\nthe woods, for forest (or wild) beasts have the forest for their share; and\nwere he not to make offering thereof, it would be a violation of the\nsacrifice.' Well, they dismiss them after fire has been carried around them 5:\nthus, indeed, it is\n\np. 308\n\nneither an offering nor a non-offering, and they do not carry the Sacrificer\ndead to the forest, and there is no violation of the sacrifice.\n\n13:2:4:44\\. He completes (the sacrifice) with tame (beasts),--father and son\npart company 1, the roads run together, the village-boundaries of two villages\nbecome contiguous, and no ogres, man-tigers, thieves, murderers, and robbers\ncome to be in the forests.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[306:3](sbe44086.htm#fr_780) The commentary remarks that by 'roads' here is\nmeant those walking on them--as, in that case, peace and security would reign,\nmen would range all the lands:--adhvabhir atradhvastha lakshyante; ksheme sati\nmanushya _h_ sarvan de _s_ an sa _m_ _k_ areyur ity abhipraya _h_.\n\n[307:1](sbe44086.htm#fr_781) Harisvamin takes 'samantikam' in the sense of\n'near' and construes it with 'gramayo _h_ ' (as he does 'viduram' in the next\nparagraph)--'the two village-boundaries would be near (far from) the two\nvillages;' but see I, 4, 1, 22, where samantikam (and IX, 3, 1, 11, where\n'samantikataram') is likewise used without a complement; as is 'viduram' in I,\n4, 1, 23.\n\n[307:2](sbe44086.htm#fr_782) Harisvamin takes ' _ri_ kshika' to 'mean 'a\nbear;'-- _ri_ ksha eva _ri_ kshika _h_.\n\n[307:3](sbe44086.htm#fr_783) Hardly as the commentary takes it, 'they would\nbecome blocked up,' and people would have to stay in their own\ncountry:--adhvana _h_ purvade _s_ adayo vikrameyur, viruddha _m_ kramayeyu _h_\n(!), svade _s_ a eva manushya _h_ sa _m_ _k_ areyur na de _s_ antare\xe0\xa4\xbdpy\nantaralanam . . bhinnatvad akshematva _k_ _k_ a vidura _m_ gramayor gramantau\nsyatam.\n\n[307:4](sbe44086.htm#fr_784) Viz. because, for want of security and peace, the\nvillages would be few and far between,--aksheme hi sati pravirala grama\nbhavanti, comm.\n\n[307:5](sbe44086.htm#fr_785) On the 'paryagnikara _n_ am' or circumambulation\nof an oblation in accordance with the course of the sun, whilst holding a\nfirebrand in one's hand, see part i, p. 45, note; part ii, p, 187, note.\n\n[308:1](sbe44086.htm#fr_786) Or, they exert themselves in different\ndirections,--that is, as the commentator explains, because in peace they would\nnot be forced to keep together, as they would have to do in troublous times.\nHe, however, seems somehow to connect 'vy avasyata _h_ ' with the root\n'vas':--ksheme hi sati pitaputrav atra vi p _ri_ thag vasata _h_ ; aksheme tu\nsambaddhav apy etav atra vasata _h_.--Whilst in this passage the verb would\nhardly suggest an estrangement between father and son, this is distinctly the\ncase in the parallel passage, Taitt. Br. III, 9, I, 2, where, however, this\ncontingency is connected with the completion of the sacrifice, not, as here,\nwith tame, but with wild beasts.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 2, 5.
