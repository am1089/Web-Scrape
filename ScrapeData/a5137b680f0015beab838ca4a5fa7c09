Now, Dush _t_ aritu Pau _m_ sayana had been expelled from the\nkingdom which had come down to him through ten generations; and the S _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_\n_g_ ayas also expelled Revottaras Pa _t_ ava Kakra Sthapati.\n\n12:9:3:22\\. He said to Dush _t_ aritu Pau _m_ sayana, 'I will perform the\nSautrama _n_ i for thee, and will comer upon thee that dominion over the S\n_ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ayas.'--'So be it!' he replied. So he performed it for him.\n\n12:9:3:33\\. Now Balhika Pratipiya, the Kauravya king, heard (people say)\nthis--'There is that Dush _t_ aritu Pau _m_ sayana who has been expelled from\nthe kingdom which has come down to him through ten generations: for him that\n_K_ akra Sthapati wants to perform the Sautrama _n_ i and to confer upon him\nthe dominion over the S _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ayas.'\n\n12:9:3:44\\. He said, 'I will just tell him that if he wants to confer dominion\nupon him, he will indeed exclude him from dominion.' He came to him at that\nparticular time (of the sacrifice) when the cups (of milk and liquor) are\ndrawn.\n\n12:9:3:55\\. He said, 'Sthapati _K_ akra, they say, Sura-liquor must not be\noffered in the \xc3\x82havaniya-fire, nor anywhere else than in the \xc3\x82havaniya: if\nthou offerest\n\np. 270\n\n[paragraph continues] Sura-liquor in the \xc3\x82havaniya thou wilt cause social\nconfusion and a repetition in the sacrifice 1, and if anywhere else than in\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya thou wilt exclude him (the king) from dominion, and wilt neither\nplace him in dominion, nor confer dominion upon him.'\n\n12:9:3:66\\. He replied, 'I shall not offer Sura-liquor in the \xc3\x82havaniya nor\nanywhere else than in the \xc3\x82havaniya thus I shall not cause social confusion\nnor a repetition in the sacrifice, and shall not exclude him from dominion; I\nshall place him in dominion, and shall confer dominion upon him.'\n\n12:9:3:77\\. He said, 'How, then, wilt thou do it?' He then told him this:--At\nfirst, indeed, that Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a (sacrifice, m.), the Sautrama _n_ i, was with\nthe Asuras. He went forth towards the gods. He came to the waters, and the\nwaters welcomed him, whence people welcome a better man when he comes to them.\nThey said to him, 'We pray thee, come, reverend sir!'\n\n12:9:3:88\\. He said, 'Nay, I am afraid: lead ye me forward!'--'Whereof art\nthou afraid, reverend sir?' they asked.--'Of the Asuras,' he said.--'Be it,\nthen!' they said. The waters led him forward, whence he who is the protector\nleads forward him who is afraid; and inasmuch as the waters led him forward\n(pra- _n_ i) therefore the waters (themselves) are 'led forward:' this is the\nreason why they are (called) Pra _n_ ita _h_  2; and, verily, firmly\nestablished is he who thus knows that nature of the Pra _n_ ita _h_.\n\np. 271\n\n12:9:3:99\\. Now, the fore-offerings had been performed, but the fire had not\nbeen carried round 1 (the oblations), when the Asuras came after him. By means\nof the circumambient fire the gods shut out their hostile rivals, the Asuras,\nfrom Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a (the sacrifice); and in like manner does this one now, by\nmeans of the circumambient fire, shut out his spiteful enemy from the\nsacrifice.\n\n12:9:3:1010\\. Verily, that \xc3\x82havaniya is the womb (seat) of the gods, and those\ntwo fires 2 on either side thereof are its immortal wings: thus, when they\nperform the sacrifice on the \xc3\x82havaniya, they indeed perform the sacrifice for\nthe gods in the womb of the gods; and, verily, the continued sacrifice\ninclines to him, and the sacrifice is not cut off from him who thus knows\nthis, or for whom, knowing this, this sacrificial rite is performed.\n\n12:9:3:1111\\. On the northern fire they offer (libations from) the cups of\nmilk, on the northern fire they cook the sacrificial animals: the sacrificial\nanimals, whilst being mortal, he thus places in the immortal womb, and them\nthat are mortal he causes to be born (again) from out of the immortal womb;\nand, verily, whosoever thus knows this, or he for whom, knowing this, this\nsacrificial rite is performed, wards off the recurring death of his cattle,\nand the sacrifice is not cut off from him.\n\n12:9:3:1212\\. On the southern fire they offer (libations from) the cups of\nSura-liquor, near the southern fire\n\np. 272\n\nthey purify (the liquor) with triple strainers: the Fathers, whilst being\nmortal, he thus places in the immortal womb, and them that are mortal he\ncauses to be born (again) from out of the immortal womb; and, verily,\nwhosoever thus knows this, or he for whom, knowing this, this sacrificial rite\nis performed, wards off the recurring death of the Fathers, and the sacrifice\nis not cut off from him.\n\n12:9:3:1313\\. Now, inasmuch as these two fires are taken from the \xc3\x82havaniya,\nthey are \xc3\x82havaniyas (offering-fires), and inasmuch as they do not again reach\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya, they are not \xc3\x82havaniyas: he thereby obtains both kinds of\noblations, that -which is (offered) on the \xc3\x82havaniya, and that which is\n(offered) on what is not an \xc3\x82havaniya--both what is offered and what is not\noffered.\n\nHe (Balhika Pratipiya) then went home, and said, 'It is not so (as we had\nthought): that kingdom of the S _ri_ _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ayas now belongs to Dush _t_\naritu;--in. such and such a manner has that _K_ akra Sthapati this day\nperformed at the sacrifice.'\n\n12:9:3:1414\\. On the northern fire they thus perform the rites of the\nsacrificial animals, the (animal) cakes, and _th_ e cups of milk, and what\nother (rite) there is: it is the gods, in the world of the gods, he thereby\ngratifies, and, thus gratified, they gratify him, and he wins the world of the\ngods.\n\n12:9:3:1515\\. In the southern fire they offer (libations from) the cups of\nSura-liquor, near the southern fire they purify (the liquor) with triple\nstrainers: it is the Fathers, in the world of the Fathers, he thereby\ngratifies, and, thus gratified, they gratify him, and he wins the world of the\nFathers.\n\n12:9:3:1616\\. Verily, the Sautrama _n_ i is the same as the\n\np. 273\n\nbody, whence it is (clearly) defined, for defined is the body. And (Indra)\nVayodhas (the bestower of strength), is the world, whence he is undefined 1,\nfor undefined is the world. The Sautrama _n_ i is the body (trunk), and the\nAindra (victim) and (the one to) Vayodhas 2 are the two arms; and inasmuch as\nthere are those two animal offerings on both sides (of the Sautrama _n_ i),\ntherefore these two arms are on both sides of the body. And as the sacrificial\nanimal, so the sacrificial stake; and inasmuch as there are those two stakes\non both sides of the stake of the Sautrama _n_ i (bull of Indra), therefore\nthese two arms are on both sides of the body 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[270:1](sbe44073.htm#fr_673) Probably inasmuch as the cups of milk are offered\nthere previously.\n\n[270:2](sbe44073.htm#fr_674) For this jarful of consecrated water, used at the\nsacrifice, see part i, pp. 9, note; 265.\n\n[271:1](sbe44073.htm#fr_675) On the ceremony called 'paryagnikara _n_ am,' see\npart i, p. 145, note; part ii, p. 187, note.\n\n[271:2](sbe44073.htm#fr_676) See [p. 225](sbe44067.htm#page_225), note\n[1](sbe44067.htm#fn_584). Properly speaking, the two fires of the two special\nVedis are in front (or, rather, north-east and south-east) of the \xc3\x82havaniya.\n\n[273:1](sbe44073.htm#fr_677) The term 'vayodhas' is said to be undefined\ninasmuch as, though it is meant to apply to Indra, the name of this god is not\nmentioned along with it in the formulas.\n\n[273:2](sbe44073.htm#fr_678) During the performance of the Sautrama _n_ i\nproper (on the fourth day) three victims are immolated, a he-goat to the A _s_\nvins, a ram to Sarasvati, and another bull to Indra. But at the beginning of\nthe whole performance--either before or after the first pap to Aditi (cf.\n[XII, 9, 2, 11](sbe44072.htm#12:9:2:11))--a bull is sacrificed to Indra; and\nat the end--after the second pap to Aditi and the dish of curds to Mitra and\nVaru _n_ a (see p. 252, note 4 (This note does not exist.--JBH))--another\nanimal sacrifice is performed to Indra Vayodhas. The sacrificial stakes for\nthe first and last of the three victims sacred to Indra, are to be placed\nnorth and south of that of Indra's second bull, the one sacrificed as part of\nthe Sautrama _n_ i proper.\n\n[273:3](sbe44073.htm#fr_679) The object of identifying different ceremonial\nacts and features with certain parts of the body is of course to impress upon\nthe mind of the Sacrificer the efficacy of the Sautrama _n_ i in securing to\nhim a new, complete body for the other life.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 1, 1.
