XVIII.\n\nDescendants of Anu. Countries and towns named after some of them, as Anga,\nBanga, and others.\n\nANU 1, the fourth son of Yayati, had three sons, Sabhanara, Chakshusha, and\nParamekshu 2. The son of the first was Kalanara 3; his son was \xc5\x9arinjaya; his\nson was Puranjaya; his son was Janamejaya; his son was Mahamani 4; his son was\nMahamanas, who had two sons, U\xc5\x9binara and Titikshu. U\xc5\x9binara had five sons,\n\xc5\x9aivi, Trin\xcc\x81a 5, Gara 6, Krimi, Darvan 7. \xc5\x9aivi had four sons, Vrishadarbha,\nSuvira, Kaikeya, and Madra 8. Titikshu had one son, Ushadratha 9; his son was\nHema 10; his son was Sutapas; his son was Bali, on whose wife five sons were\nbegotten by Dirghatamas, or Anga, Banga, Kalinga, Suhma, and Pun\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ra 11; and\ntheir descendants, and the five countries they inhabited, were known by the\nsame names 12.\n\np. 445\n\nThe son of Anga was Para 13; his son was Divaratha; his son was Dharmaratha\n14; his son was Chitraratha; his son was Romapada 15, also called Da\xc5\x9baratha,\nto whom, being childless, Da\xc5\x9baratha, the son of Aja, gave his daughter \xc5\x9aanta\nto be adopted 16. After this, Romapada had a son named Chaturanga; his son was\nPrithulaksha; his son was Champa, who founded the city of Champa 17. The son\nof Champa was Haryyanga; his son was Bhadraratha, who had two sons,\nVrihatkarman and Vrihadratha. The son of the first was Vrihadbhanu 18; his son\nwas Vrihanmanas; his son was Jayadratha, who, by a wife who was the daughter\nof a Kshatriya father and Brahmani mother, had a son named Vijaya 19;\n\np. 446\n\nhis son was Dhriti; his son was Dhritavrata; his son was Satyakarman; his son\nwas Adhiratha 20, who found Karna in a basket on the banks of the Ganges,\nwhere he had been exposed by his mother, Pritha. The son of Karn\xcc\x81a was\nVrishasena 21. These were the Anga kings. You shall next hear who were the\ndescendants of Puru.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[444:1](vp111.htm#fr_1195) By some unaccountable caprice the Brahma P. and\nHari V., unsupported by any other authority, here substitute for Anu the name\nof Kaksheyu, a descendant of Puru, and transfer the whole series of his\nposterity to the house of Puru.\n\n[444:2](vp111.htm#fr_1196) Paksha and Parapaksha: Vayu. Parameshu: Matsya.\nParoksha: Bhagavata.\n\n[444:3](vp111.htm#fr_1197) Kalanala: Vayu. Kolahala: Matsya.\n\n[444:4](vp111.htm#fr_1198) Maha\xc5\x9bala: Agni. Maha\xc5\x9bila: Bhagav.\n\n[444:5](vp111.htm#fr_1199) Nriga: Agni. Vana: Bhagavata.\n\n[444:6](vp111.htm#fr_1200) Nava: Matsya. \xc5\x9aama: Bhagavata.\n\n[444:7](vp111.htm#fr_1201) Vrata: Agni. Suvrata: Matsya. Daksha: Bhagavata.\nAccording to the Brahma P. and Hari V. the five sons of U\xc5\x9binara were the\nancestors of different tribes. \xc5\x9aivi was the progenitor of the \xc5\x9aaivas; Nriga of\nthe Yaudheyas; Nava of the Navarasht\xcc\x81ras; Vrata of the \xc3\x81mbasht\xcc\x81has; and Krimi\nfounded the city Krimila.\n\n[444:8](vp111.htm#fr_1202) Bhadra and Bhadraka: Matsya, Agni. These sons of\n\xc5\x9aivi give name to different provinces and tribes in the west and north-west of\nIndia.\n\n[444:9](vp111.htm#fr_1203) Rushadratha: Agni. Tushadratha: Matsya.\n\n[444:10](vp111.htm#fr_1204) Phen\xcc\x81a: Agni. Sena: Matsya.\n\n[444:11](vp111.htm#fr_1205) Odra, or in some copies Andhra: Bhagavata.\n\n[444:12](vp111.htm#fr_1206) See [p. 185](vp061.htm#page_185). n.\n[3](vp061.htm#fn_479); [p. 188](vp061.htm#page_188). n.\n[46](vp061.htm#fn_522), [49](vp061.htm#fn_525), [50](vp061.htm#fn_526); and\n[p. 190](vp061.htm#page_190). n. [73](vp061.htm#fn_549). Of Suhma it may be\nremarked, that it is specified in the Siddhanta Kaumudi as an example of\nPanini's rule; 17.3.24; by which Nagara compounded with names of countries in\nthe east becomes Nagara, as Sauhmanagara, 'produced, &c. in a city of Suhma.'\nThe descendants of Anu, according to the Mahabharata were all Mlechchhas. The\nlast named work, as well as the Vayu and Matsya Puran\xcc\x81as, have an absurd story\nof the circumstances of the birth of Dirghatamas, who was the son of Ujasi or\nUtathya, the elder brother of Vrihaspati by Mamata, and of his begetting Anga\np. 445 and the rest. They agree in assigning descendants of all four castes to\nthem; the Vayu stating that Bali had ### and the Matsya ascribing it to a boon\ngiven by Brahma to Bali: 'Do thou establish the four perpetual castes.' Of\nthese, the Brahmans are known as Baleyas: ###. The Matsya calls Bali, the son\nof Virochana, and 'existing for a whole Kalpa;' identifying him therefore,\nonly in a different period and form, with the Bali of the Vamana Avatara.\n\n[445:13](vp111.htm#fr_1207) Anapana: Vayu. Khanapana: Bhagavata. Adhivahana:\nAgni. Dadhivahana: Matsya.\n\n[445:14](vp111.htm#fr_1208) This prince is said in the Vayu to have drank the\nSoma juice along with Indra.\n\n[445:15](vp111.htm#fr_1209) The Matsya and Agni insert a Satyaratha.\n\n[445:16](vp111.htm#fr_1210) This is noticed in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, in the story of\nthe hermit Rishya\xc5\x9bringa, to whom \xc5\x9aanta was given in marriage. Her adoptive\nfather is called in the Ramayan\xcc\x81a, as the is in the Agni and Matsya, Lomapada:\nthe meaning is the same, 'hairy foot.' Ramayan\xcc\x81a, IX. X. See also Prelude to\nthe Uttara Rama Cheritra, Hindu Theatre, I. 289.\n\n[445:17](vp111.htm#fr_1211) The Bhagavata differs here from all the other\nauthorities in omitting Champa, the founder of Champapuri, a city of which\ntraces still remain in the vicinity of Bhagalpur, having inserted him\npreviously amongst the descendants of Ikshwaku (see [p.\n373](vp095.htm#page_373). n. [12](vp095.htm#fn_982)). Champa is every where\nrecognised as the capital of Anga, and the translators of the Ramayan\xcc\x81a were\nvery wide of the truth, when they conjectured that it might be Angwa or Ava.\n\n[445:18](vp111.htm#fr_1212) Vrihaddarbha: Brahma. The Bhagavata omits the two\nsuccessors of Champa, and makes Vrihadratha, Vrihatkarman, and Vrihadbhanu,\nsons of Prithulaksha.\n\n[445:19](vp111.htm#fr_1213) The Vayu, Matsya, and Hari V. make Vijaya the\nbrother of Jayadratha. The Bhagavata agrees with our text. The mother of\nVijaya from her origin was of the Suta caste, the genealogist and charioteer.\nManu, X. 47. Her son was of the same caste, children taking the caste of the\nmother: consequently the descendants of Vijaya, kings of Anga, were Sutas; and\nthis explains the contemptuous application of the term Suta to Karn\xcc\x81a, the\nhalf brother of the Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81us; for he, as p. 446 will presently be mentioned,\nwas adopted into the Anga family, and succeeded to the crown.\n\n[446:20](vp111.htm#fr_1214) Some variety prevails in the series of princes\nhere, but this arises from not distinguishing the collateral lines, the\ndescendants of Jayadratha from those of Vijaya. The Vayu and Matsya give the\nlatter as in our text, but they agree also with the Agni and Brahma in the\nsuccessors of Jayadratha, as Drid\xcc\x81haratha or Vrihadratha, and Janamejaya or\nVi\xc5\x9bwajit.\n\n[446:21](vp111.htm#fr_1215) Surasena: Vayu. Vikarn\xcc\x81a: Brahma.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIX](vp112.htm)\n\n"
