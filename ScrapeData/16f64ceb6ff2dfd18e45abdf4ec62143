Why so sore afraid?  \nKeep still thy word. The righteous deem  \nThat truth, mid duties, is supreme:  \nAnd now in truth and honour's name  \nI bid thee own the binding claim.  \nS'aivya, a king whom earth obeyed,  \nOnoe to a hawk a promise made,  \nGave to the bird his flesh and bone,  \nAnd by his truth made heaven his own.  1  \nAlarka, when a Brahman famed  \nFor Scripture lore his promise claimed,  \nTore from his head his bleeding eyes  \nAnd unreluctant gave the prize.  \nHis narrow bounds prescribed restrain  \nThe Rivers' Lord, the mighty main,  \nWho, though his waters boil and rave,  \nKeeps faithful to the word he gave.  \nTruth all religion comprehends,  \nThrough all the world its might extends:  \nIn truth alone is justice placed,  \nOn truth the words of God are based;  \nA life in truth unchanging past  \nWill bring the highest bliss at last  \nIf thou the right would still pursue,  \nBe constant to thy word and true:  \nLet me thy promise fruitful see,  \nFor boons, O King, proceed from thee.  \nNow to preserve thy righteous fame,  \nAnd yielding to my earnest claim--  \nThrice I repeat it--send thy child,  \nThy Rama, to the forest wild.  \nBut if the boon thou still deny,  \nBefore thy face, forlorn, I die.'  \n\nThus was the helpless monarch stung  \nBy Queen Kaikeyi's fearless tongue,  \nAs Bali strove in vain to loose  \nHis limbs from Indra's fatal noose.  \nDismayed in soul and pale with fear,  \nThe monarch, like a trembling steer  \nBetween the chariot's wheel and yoke,  \nAgain to Queen Kaikeyi spoke,  \nWith sad eyes fixt in vacant stare,  \nGathering courage from despair:  \n'That hand I took, thou sinful dame,  \nWith texts, before the sacred flame,  \nThee and thy son, I scorn and hate,  \nAnd all at once repudiate.  \n\np. 108  \n\nThe night is fled: the dawn is near:  \nSoon will the holy priests be here  \nTo bid me for the rite prepare  \nThat with my son the tnrone will share,  \nThe preparation made to grace  \nMy Rama in his royal place--  \nWith this, e'en this, my darling for  \nMy death the funeral flood shall pour.  \nThou and thy son at least forbear  \nIn offerings to my shade to share,  \nFor by the plot thy guile has laid  \nHis consecration will be stayed.  \nThis very day how shall I brook  \nTo meet each subject's altered look?  \nTo mark each gloomy joyless brow  \nThat was so bright and glad but now?'  \n\nWhile thus the high-souled monarch spoke  \nTo the stern queen, the Morning broke,  \nAnd holy night had slowly fled,  \nWith moon and stars engarlanded.  \nYet once again the cruel queen  \nSpoke words in answer fierce and keen,  \nStill on her evil purpose bent,  \nWild with her rage and eloquent:  \n'What speech is this? Such words as these  \nSeem sprung from poison-sown disease.  \nQuick to thy noble Rama send  \nAnd bid him on his sire attend.  \nWhen to my son the rule is given;  \nWhen Rama to the woods is driven;  \nWhen not a rival copes with me,  \nFrom chains of duty thou art free.'  \n\nThus goaded, like a generous steed  \nUrged by sharp spurs to double speed,  \n'My senses are astray,' he cried,  \n'And duty's bonds my hands have tied.  \nI long to see mine eldest son,  \nMy virtuous, my beloved one.'  \n\nAnd now the night had past away;  \nOut shone the Maker of the Day,  \nBringing the planetary hour  \nAnd moment of auspicious power.  \nVas'ishtha, virtuous, far renowned,  \nWhose young disciples girt him round,  \nWith sacred things without delay  \nThrough the fair city took his way.  \nHe traversed, where the people thronged.  \nAnd all for Rama's coming longed,  \nThe town as fair in festive show  \nAs his who lays proud cities low.  1  \nHe reached the palace where he heard  \nThe mingled notes of many a bird,  \nWhere crowded thick high-honoured bands  \nOf guards with truncheons in their hands.  \nBegirt by many a sage, elate,  \nVas'ishtha reached the royal gate,  \n\nAnd standing by the door he found  \nSumantra, for his form renowned,  \nThe king's illustrious charioteer  \nAnd noble counsellor and peer.  \nTo him well skilled in every part  \nOf his hereditary art  \nVas'ishtha said: 'O charioteer,  \nInform the king that I am here,  \nHere ready by my side behold  \nThese sacred vessels made of gold,  \nWhich water for the rite contain  \nFrom Ganga and each distant main.  \nHere for installing I have brought  \nThe seat prescribed of fig-wood wrought,  \nAll kinds of seed and precious scent  \nAnd many a gem and ornament;  \nGrain, sacred grass, the garden's spoil,  \nHoney and curds and milk and oil;  \nEight radiant maids, the best of all  \nWar elephants that feed in stall;  \nA four-horse car, a bow and sword.  \nA litter, men to bear their lord;  \nA white umbrella bright and fair  \nThat with the moon may well compare;  \nTwo chouries of the whitest hair;  \nA golden beaker rich and rare;  \nA bull high-humped and fair to view,  \nGirt with gold bands and white of hue;  \nA four-toothed steed with flowing mane,  \nA throne which lions carved sustain;  \nA tiger's skin, the sacred fire,  \nFresh kindled, which the rites require;  \nThe best musicians skilled to play,  \nAnd dancing-girls in raiment gay;  \nKine, Brahmans, teachers fill the court,  \nAnd bird and beast of purest sort.  \nFrom town and village, far and near,  \nThe noblest men are gathered here;  \nHere merchants with their followers crowd,  \nAnd men in joyful converse loud,  \nAnd kings from many a distant land  \nTo view the consecration stand.  \nThe dawn is come, the lucky day;  \nGo bid the monarch haste away,  \nThat now Prince Rama may obtain  \nThe empire, and begin his reign.'  \n\nSoon as he heard the high behest  \nThe driver of the chariot pressed  \nWithin the chambers of the king,  \nHis lord with praises honouring.  \nAnd none of all the warders checked  \nHis entrance for their great respect  \nOf him well known, in place so high,  \nStill fain their king to gratify.  \nHe stood beside the royal chief,  \nUnwitting of his deadly grief,  \nAnd with sweet words began to sing  \nThe praises of his lord and king:  \n'As, when the sun begins to rise,  \nThe sparkling sea delights our eyes,  \nWake, calm with gentle soul, and thus  \n\np. 109  \n\nGive rapture, mighty King, to us.  \nAs Matali  1 this selfsame hour  \nSang lauds of old to Indra's power,  \nWhen he the Titan hosts o'erthrew,  \nSo hymn I thee with praises due.  \nThe Vedas, with their kindred lore,  \nBrahma their soul-born Lord adore,  \nWith all the doctrines of the wise,  \nAnd bid him, as I bid thee, rise.  \nAs, with the moon, the Lord of Day  \nWakes with the splendour of his ray  \nProlific Earth, who neath him lies,  \nSo, mighty King, I bid thee rise.  \nWith blissful words, O Lord of men,  \nRise, radiant in thy form, as when  \nThe sun ascending darts his light  \nFrom Meru's everlasting height.  \nMay \xc2\x8civa, Agni, Sun, and Moon  \nBestow on thee each choicest boon,  \nKuvera, Varun, Indra bless  \nKakutstha's son with all success.  \nAwake, the holy night is fled,  \nThe happy light abroad is spread;  \nAwake, O best of kings, and share  \nThe glorious task that claims thy care.  \nThe holy sage Va\xc2\x9cishtha waits,  \nWith all his Brahmans, at the gate  \nGive thy decree, without delay,  \nTo consecrate thy son today.  \nAs armies, by no captain led,  \nAs flocks that feed unshepherded,  \nSuch is the fortune of a state  \nWithout a king and desolate.'  \n   Such were the words the bard addressed,  \nWith weight of sage advice impressed;  \nAnd, as he heard, the hapless king  \nFelt deeper yet his sorrow's sting.  \nAt length, all joy and comfort fled,  \nHe raised his eyes with weeping red,  \nAnd, mournful for his Rama's sake.  \nThe good and glorious monarch spake:  \n'Why seek with idle praise to greet  \nThe wretch for whom no praise is meet!  \nThy words mine aching bosom tear,  \nAnd plunge me deeper in despair.'  \n   Sumantra heard the sad reply,  \nAnd saw his master's tearful eye.  \nWith reverent palm to palm applied  \nHe drew a little space aside.  \nThen, as the king, with misery weak,  \nWith vain endeavour strove to speak,  \nKaikeyi, skilled in plot and plan,  \nTo sage Sumantra thus began:  \n'The king, absorbed in joyful thought  \nFor his dear son, no rest has sought:  \nSleepless to him the night has past,  \nAnd now o'erwatched he sinks at last  \nThen go, Sumantra, and with speed  \n\nThe glorious Rama hither lead:  \nGo, as I pray, nor longer wait;  \nNo time is this to hesitate.'  \n   'How can I go, O Ladv fair,  \nUnless my lord his will declare?'  \n   'Fain would I see him,' cried the king,  \n'Quick, quick, my beauteous Rama bring.'  \n   Then rose the happy thought to cheer  \nThe bosom of the charioteer,  \n'The king, I ween, of pious mind.  \nThe consecration has designed.'  \nSumantra for his wisdom famed,  \nDelighted with the thought he framed,  \nFrom the calm chamber, like a bay  \nOf crowded ocean, took his way.  \n   He turned his face to neither side,  \n    But forth he hurried straight;  \nOnly a little while he eyed  \nThe guards who kept the gate.  \nHe saw in front a gathered crowd  \n  Of men of every class,  \nWho, parting as he came, allowed  \n  The charioteer to pass.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[107:1](ry092.htm#fr_277) See _Additional Notes_ , THE SUPPLIANT DOVE.\n\n[108:1](ry092.htm#fr_278) Indra, called also Purandara, Town destroyer.\n\n[109:1](ry092.htm#fr_279) Indra's charioteer.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XV.: The Preparations.](ry093.htm)\n\n"
