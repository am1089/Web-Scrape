Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said: Tell me, O Ke\xc5\x9bava, by what sins particular signs are\nproduced, and to what sorts of birth such sins lead?\n\n2\\. The Blessed Lord said: The sins on account of which the sinful returning\nfrom hell come to particular births, and the signs produced by particular\nsins,--these hear from me.\n\n3\\. The murderer of a Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87 becomes consumptive, the killer of a cow becomes\nhump-backed and imbecile, the murderer of a virgin becomes leprous,--all three\nborn as outcastes.\n\n4\\. The slayer of a woman and the destroyer of embryos becomes a savage full\nof diseases; who commits illicit intercourse, a eunuch; who goes with his\nteacher's wife, diseased-skinned.\n\n5\\. The eater of flesh becomes very red; the drinker of intoxicants, one with\ndiscoloured teeth; the Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87 who, on account of greed, eats what should not\nbe eaten, becomes big-bellied.\n\n6\\. He who eats sweet foods, without giving to others, becomes swollen-necked;\nwho gives impure food at a \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha ceremony is born a spotted leper.\n\n7\\. The man who, through pride, insults his teacher, becomes an\n\np. 39\n\nepileptic; who despises the Vedas and the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras certainly becomes jaundiced.\n\n8\\. Who bears false witness becomes dumb; who breaks the meal-row 1 becomes\none-eyed; who interferes with marriage becomes lipless; who steals a book-is\nborn blind.\n\n9\\. Who strikes a cow or a Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87 with his foot is born lame and deformed;\nwho speaks lies becomes a stammerer, and who listens to them becomes deaf.\n\n10\\. A poisoner becomes insane; an incendiary becomes bald; who sells flesh\nbecomes unlucky; who eats fled of other beings becomes diseased.\n\n11\\. Who steals jewels is born in a low caste; who steals gold gets diseased\nnails; who steals any metal becomes poverty-stricken.\n\n12\\. Who steals food becomes a rat; who steals grain becomes a locust; who\nsteals water becomes a Ch\xc4\x81taka-bird 2; and who steals poison, a scorpion.\n\n13\\. Who steals vegetables and leaves becomes a peacock; perfumes, a musk-rat;\nhoney, a gad-fly; flesh, a vulture; and salt, an ant.\n\n14\\. Who steals betel, fruits and flowers becomes a forest-monkey; who steal\nshoes, grass and cotton are born from sheeps' wombs.\n\np. 40\n\n15\\. Who lives by violence, who robs caravans on the road, and who is fond of\nhunting, certainly becomes a goat in a butcher's house.\n\n16\\. Who dies by drinking poison becomes a black serpent on a mountain; whose\nfeature is unrestrained becomes an elephant in a desolate forest.\n\n17\\. Those twice-born who do not make offering to the World-deities, and who\neat all foods without consideration, become tigers in a desolate forest.\n\n18\\. The Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 who does not recite the G\xc4\x81yatr\xc4\xab 1, who does not meditate at\ntwilight, who is inwardly wicked while outwardly pious, becomes a crane.\n\n19\\. The Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 who officiates for one unfit to perform sacrifice becomes a\nvillage hog, and by too many sacrifices he becomes an ass; by eating without\ngrace, a crow.\n\n20\\. The twice-born who does not impart learning to the deserving becomes a\nbull; the pupil who does not serve his teacher becomes an animal,--an ass or a\ncow.\n\n21\\. Who threatens and spits at his teacher, or browbeats a Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87, is born\nas a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87-fiend in a waterless wilderness.\n\n22\\. Who does not give to a twice-born according to his promise becomes a\njackal; who is not hospitable to the goody becomes a howling Fire-face. 2\n\np. 41\n\n23\\. Who deceives a friend becomes a mountain-vulture; who cheats in selling,\nan owl; who speaks ill of caste and order is born a pigeon in a wood.\n\n24\\. Who destroys hopes and who destroys affection, who through dislike\nabandons his wife, becomes a ruddy goose for a long time.\n\n25\\. Who hates mother, father and teacher, who quarrels with sister and\nbrother, is destroyed when an embryo in the womb, even for a thousand births.\n\n26\\. The woman who abuses her mother-in-law and father-in-law, and causes\nconstant quarrels; becomes a leech; and she who scolds her husband becomes a\nlouse.\n\n27\\. Who, abandoning her own husband, runs after another man, becomes a\nflying-fox, a house-lizard, or a kind of female serpent.\n\n28\\. He who cuts off his lineage, by embracing a woman of his own family,\nhaving become a hyena and a porcupine, is born from the womb of a bear.\n\n29\\. The lustful man who goes with a female ascetic becomes a desert fiend;\nwho consorts with an immature girl becomes a huge snake in a wood.\n\n30\\. Who covets his teacher's wife, becomes a chameleon; who goes with the\nking's wife becomes corrupt; and with his friend's wife, a donkey.\n\np. 42\n\n31\\. Who commits unnatural vice becomes a village pig; who consorts with a\n\xc5\x9a\xc5\xabdra woman becomes bull; who is passionate becomes a lustful horse.\n\n32-33. Who feeds upon the eleventh-day offerings to the dead is born a dog.\nThe devalaka is born from the womb of a hen.\n\nThe wretch among twice-born who worships the deities for the sake of wealth is\ncalled a devalaka and is unfit to offer oblations to ale deities and\nforefathers.\n\n34\\. Those who are very sinful, having passed through dreadful hells produced\nby their great sins, are born here upon the exhaustion of their karma.\n\n35\\. The murderer of a Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87 goes into the womb of an ass, a camel and a\nshe-buffalo; a drinker of intoxicants enters the wombs of a wolf, a dog and a\njackal.\n\n36\\. The stealer of gold attains the condition of a worm, an insect and a\nbird. Who goes with his teacher's wife, goes to the condition of grass, bushes\nand plants.\n\n37\\. Who steals another's wife, who misappropriates deposits, who robs a\nBr\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87, is born as a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87-fiend.\n\np. 43\n\n38-40. The Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87's possessions acquired by deception, enjoyed even in\nfriendship, afflict the family even for seven generations,--and by forcible\nrobbery even as long as the moon and stars exist:\n\nA man may digest even iron filings, powdered stone, and poison; but where is\nthe person in the three worlds who can digest a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87's wealth!\n\nChariots and troops supported by the wealth of a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 crumble away in\nbattle like artificial river-banks of sand.\n\n41-43. By appropriating temple property, by taking a Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87's possessions,\nand by neglecting Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s, families become broken up.\n\nHe is called a neglector who, instead of making a gift to one who is well-read\nin the Vedas and \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras and has resorted to him, gives it to some other,\n\nBut it is no neglect if the Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87 is without Veda-knowledge; it would be\nlike offering to ashes instead of to the blazing fire near by.\n\n44\\. Having neglected, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, and having experienced the results in the\nsuccessive hells, he is born blind and in poverty, becoming not a giver but a\nbeggar.\n\n45\\. Who takes away a plot of land, which was given by himself for another, is\nborn for sixty thousand years as a worm in excrement.\n\n46\\. The sinner who takes back by force what has been given by himself, goes\ninto hell until the coming of the deluge.\n\np. 44\n\n47\\. Having given the means of subsistence and a piece of land, he should then\nprotect it firmly. Who does not protect, but robs, is born as a lame dog.\n\n48\\. Who gives the means of support to Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s obtains fruit equal to that of\na lakh of cows; who robs Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s of their means of sup port becomes an ape, a\ndog and a monkey.\n\n49\\. These and other signs and births, O Lord of Birds, are seen to be the\nkarma of the embodied, made by themselves in this world.\n\n50\\. Thus the makers of bad karma, having experienced the tortures mf hell,\nare born with the residues of their sins, in these stated forms.\n\n51\\. Then, obtaining for thousands of lives the bodies of animals, they suffer\nfrom carrying burdens and other miseries.\n\n52\\. Having experienced as a bird the misery of cold, rain and heat, he\nafterwards reaches the human state, when the good and evil are balanced.\n\n53\\. Man and woman having come together, he becomes an embryo in due course.\nHaving suffered the miseries from conception onwards to death, he again dies.\n\n54\\. Birth and death are the lot of all embodied beings; thus turns the wheel\nin the four kingdoms of beings.\n\n55\\. As the wheel of time turns, so mortals revolve by my magic. They revolve\nat one time of earth, at another in hell, held fast by the noose of karma.\n\np. 45\n\n56\\. He who does not mike gifts becomes poverty--stricken and through poverty\nhe commits sin; by the force of sin he goes to hell, and is again born in\npoverty and again becomes sinful.\n\n57\\. Karma which has been made, whether good or evil, must inevitably be\nsuffered. Karma not suffered does not fade away even in tens of millions of\nages.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[39:1](gpu07.htm#fr_55) This refers to the custom among Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s of sitting in\na row at meals, and rising together.
