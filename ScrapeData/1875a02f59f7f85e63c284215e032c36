WRITINGS AND POSSESSION.\n\n1. 1 A writing (or document) should be signed by witnesses, the (natural) order of ideas and syllables should not be interrupted, local customs and general rules should be observed in it, and it should be complete in every respect.\n\n2. 2 A document signed by the king with his own hand, or sealed with his own seal, is declared to be a royal document, and is (considered as equal to) an attested document in all affairs.\n\n3. 3 A document suspected (to have a blemish) is valid, unless the debtor should have clearly indicated its blemish; and so (is the validity of) a document which is more than twenty years old (established by mere lapse of time).\n\n4. 4 In the beginning, gift is a cause (of ownership);\n\np. 243\n\nin the middle, possession with a title; but continued and hereditary\npossession by itself is also a good cause (of ownership).\n\n5. 5 There are six modes of acquiring wealth: by obtaining (property), what is declared to have been given or earned, (acquisition through) valour, (in the shape of) a marriage portion, and through inheritance from relations or others.\n\n6. 6 Having listened to the answer, (the plaintiff) at the trial shall produce a document as evidence, or he shall prove possession continued for a long time, and corroborated by (the statements of) the neighbours, or by (other) evidence.\n\n7. 7 Supposing a religious student were to perform some vow extending over a period of thirty-six years, or a man (engaged in trade or traffic) were to reside abroad for a long time in the pursuit of wealth:\n\np. 244\n\n8\\. If, then, the student after having completed his period of studentship\n(and returned from his preceptor) were to look after his property, possession\n(by a stranger) continued for fifty years would be capable of depriving him of\nhis property.\n\n9\\. Twelve years for (the study of) each Veda is the period ordained for those\nengaged in the pursuit of religious knowledge; for those engaged in the\nacquisition of mechanical (or manual) skill, the period (of apprenticeship) is\ndeclared to last till they have acquired their art.\n\n10\\. What has been possessed against their wish by their friends or relations,\nand what has been possessed by persons offending against the king, is not lost\nby the lapse of (a long) time.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[242:1](sbe3354.htm#fr_745) IV, 1. Sm _ri_ ti _k_. lekhya _m_ tu sakshimat\nkaryam aviluptakramaksharam | de _s_ a _k_ arasthitiyuta _m_ samagra _m_\nsarvavastushu ||\n\n[242:2](sbe3354.htm#fr_746) Sm _ri_ ti _k_.; Viram. p. 195 ('Vasish _th_ a').\n\n[242:3](sbe3354.htm#fr_747) Sm _ri_ ti _k_.; Viram. p. 200 ('Katyayana'). The\nvalidity of a document having been called into doubt, because it either has a\nblemish or has been vitiated by the lapse of a considerable time, it becomes\nvalid through proof by ordeal. This is the meaning, mere lapse of time being\ninsufficient to produce validity. Sm _ri_ ti _k_. This interpretation can\nhardly be correct, as ordeals are not referred to in this text.\n\n[242:4](sbe3354.htm#fr_748) M. Macn. III, 6, 5. In the case of the first man\n(possessor) p. 243 possession proved by witnesses is superior to, or more\ndecisive than, possession, excepting hereditary possession. Such hereditary\npossession, again, is superior in the case of the fourth in descent to a title\nproved by documents. In the case of an intermediate claimant (as e.g. the\nsecond or third in descent) a title coupled with possession of short duration\neven is more decisive than a title entirely destitute of possession.

'The term sadhanam a fortiori denotes witnesses in this place.\nTherefore the meaning is as follows. In a dispute regarding a house, field, or\nother (immovable property), the claimant must adduce a document or witnesses,\nor he must plead possession.'
