Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus, the Devi asked the Danava, \xc2\x93Who is\nthat Mandodari? Who is that king who was not first taken by her? And who is\nthat king whom she married afterwards? And how did she repent afterwards?\nDescribe all these in detail to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n3-26. Thus asked by the Devi, Mahi _s_ a began to say :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! There is a\nplace, named Simhala, noted in this earth and decorated with various trees and\nprosperous with wealth and grains. A virtuous king, named Chandrasena, used to\nreign there; he was calm, peaceful, truthful, heroic, charitable, steady,\nforbearing, well versed in polities, ethics and morals vast as a wide ocean,\nlearned in S\xc2\x92astras, knowing all forms of religions and much skilled in\narchery. He was mindful in governing his subjects and he used to punish\naccording to the laws of Justice. The king had a beautiful well-qualified\nwife, very handsome and broad-hipped. She was very much devoted to her husband\nand always engaged in religious acts and of good conduct. This wife, endowed\nwith all auspicious signs, gave birth to a beautiful daughter in her first\ndelivery. The King Chandrasena, the father, was very pleased to have this\nbeautiful daughter and gladly called her by the name of Mandodari. This\ndaughter began to grow daily like the phases of the Moon. When she grew ten\nyears old, she became very handsome. The King now became anxious to have\n\n\n\np. 411\n\n\n\na suitable bridegroom and used to think of it everyday. The Brahmi _n_ s then\ntold the king that there was a prince named Kambugriva, the intelligent son of\nthe powerful king Sudhanva of Madra; this prince was endowed, with all kingly\nqualifications and versed in all knowledge and was therefore a fit match for\nyour daughter. The king then asked his dear qualified wife that he would like\nto marry his daughter to Kambugriva. The queen, hearing this, asked her\ndaughter Mandodari that her father was desiring to marry her to Kambugriva,\nthe son of the king of Madra. Hearing her mother\xc2\x92s words, Mandodari spoke thus\n:-- \xc2\x93O Mother! I have got no desire to marry; I will not accept any husband; I\nwill take the vow of leading a chaste virgin life and thus pass the rest of my\nlife. O Mother! There is nothing more miserable in this ocean of world than\ndependence; I therefore prefer to lead incessantly a life of severe\nasceticism. The Pundits versed in the S\xc2\x92astras say that taking up the vow of\nseparateness and independence leads to salvation; I will thus be liberated; I\nhave no need for a husband. At the time of marriage ceremony, one has to say\nbefore the consecrated Fire that one will remain always a dependent to one\xc2\x92s\nhusband in every way; besides in a father-in-law\xc2\x92s house, one has to pass\none\xc2\x92s time as a slave, as it were, to one\xc2\x92s mother-in-law and to husband\xc2\x92s\n(younger) brothers; again one will have to think oneself as happy when one\xc2\x92s\nhusband is happy and as unhappy when one\xc2\x92s husband is unhappy; this is the\nworst of all miseries. Again if the husband marries again another woman, then\nthis misery of having a co-wife is extreme. O Mother! Jealousy arises then\ntowards even one\xc2\x92s own husband and therefore suffering is endless. Therefore\nwhat happiness can there be in this dream-like worlds; especially with women\nwho are made dependent by Nature? O Mother! I heard that in days of yore the\nreligious son of Uttanapada, Uttama was younger than Dhruva; and yet he became\nKing. And the King Uttanapada banished his dear wife, solely devoted to her\nhusband, without any cause, to the forest. Therefore women have to suffer such\ndiverse pains while their husbands are living; and if by chance the husband\ndies, then women get interminable pains; the widowhood becomes the only source\nof grief and sorrow. Again if the husband be in foreign lands, women become\nsubjected to the fire of Cupid, and then the house becomes an object of more\nagony. Thus whether the husband lives or dies, there is no happiness at any\ntime. Thus, according to my opinion, I ought never to accept any husband.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n27-31. The Mother then told her husband all about what the daughter had said.\nMandodari would accept the vow of a life-long virgin; she had no desire to\nmarry. She had brought forward many faults in a worldly life and thus would\nperform vows and Japams and pass her time alone.\n\n\n\np. 412\n\n\n\nShe did not yearn after a husband. The King, hearing thus, came to know, that\nhis daughter had no intention to marry and so began to pass his time without\ngiving away his daughter in marriage. Thus the daughter lived in family\nprotected by her father and mother; by that time signs of puberty were seen in\nthe body of the daughter. Her comrades requested her repeatedly to select a\nbridegroom; but she spoke many words of wisdom and did not show any\ninclination for marriage.\n\n\n\n32-44. Once, on an occasion, that beautiful faced woman went out with her\nfemale attendants on a pleasure trip to a garden, beautified with various\ntrees. There the slender bodied one began to play and enjoy with her comrades\nin picking up various flowers and beautiful flowering creepers. Just at that\ntime, the famous King of Kosala, the powerful Virasena came there\naccidentally. Alone he was on his chariot, attended by a few soldiers; his\nlarge army and retinue were coming slowly behind him at some distance. Her\ncomrades, then, looking at that King from a distance, told Mandodari, \xc2\x93O\nfriend! See! Somebody, strong and beautiful, like a second God of Love is\ncoming towards us, mounted on a chariot. I think some King he will be and we\nare very lucky that he has come here.\xc2\x94 While thus talking, the King arrived\nthere. The King, looking on that blue coloured woman with beautiful eyes\nbecame surprised and getting down from the chariot, asked the maidservant, \xc2\x93O\nGentle one! Who is this woman with large eyes! Who is her father? Tell me this\nwithout any delay.\xc2\x94 The attendant smiling, told him thus :-- O Beautiful-eyed\nOne! Pray speak first who are you? What for have you come here? What do you\nwant to do here? The female attendant thus asking him, the King replied :--\nThere is a very beautiful country named Kosala, in this earth; I am the King\nof that place; my name is Virasena. My fourfold army is coming at my will at\nmy back. I have lost my way and have come here. Know me as the King of the\ncountry Kosala.\n\n\n\n45-49. The female attendant said :-- \xc2\x93O King! This lotus-eyed one is the\ndaughter of the King Chandrasena; her name is Mandodari. She has come here in\nthis garden for sporting.\xc2\x94 Hearing thus the attendant\xc2\x92s words, the King\nreplied :-- \xc2\x93O Sairandhri! You appear to be smart; therefore make the King\xc2\x92s\ndaughter understand my following words clearly! O Sweet-eyed one! I am the\nKing descended from the Kakutstha line; O fair woman! Marry me according to\nthe rules of Gandarbha marriage.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nNote :-- Gandharva marriage: one of the eight forms of marriage; this form of\nmarriage proceeds entirely from love or the mutual inclination of a youth and\nmaiden without ceremonies and without consulting relatives.\n\n\n\np. 413\n\n\n\n\xc2\x93O broad hipped One! I have no other wife; you are a beautiful woman, of a\ngood family and of a marriageable age; I therefore like to marry you? Or your\nfather may marry you to me according to rules and ceremonies; if so, I will no\ndoubt be your husband as you desire.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n50-55. Mahi _s_ a said :-- O Devi! The female attendant, expert in the science\nof love, hearing the King\xc2\x92s words, spoke to the daughter smilingly and in\nsweet words. \xc2\x93O Mandodari! A very good-looking beautiful King of the solar\ndynasty has come here; he is very pretty, powerful, and of your age; O\nBeautiful! The King is entirely devoted to you and loves you very much. O\nLarge-eyed One! Your time of marriage has come and yet you have not married;\nrather you are against it. Your father is, therefore, always very sorry and\nremorseful. See! How many a time your father sighed and told us, \xc2\x91O\nattendants! Always serve my daughter and awaken her to this.\xc2\x92 But you are\nengaged in penances and austerities, in Ha _t_ ha Dharma; therefore we cannot\nrequest you on this matter. The Munis have said :-- To serve the husband is\nthe highest virtue of a woman. O Large-eyed! Women get Heaven if they serve\ntheir husband; therefore you better marry according to rules and ceremonies.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n56\\. Mandodari said :-- I am not going to marry; better that I should perform\nan extraordinary tapasya (asceticism); O Girls! You go and ask the King desist\nin his request; why is he shamelessly looking at me.\n\n\n\n57-59. The female attendant then said, \xc2\x93O Devi! Passion is very hard to\nconquer; time is also surmountable with difficulty; so know my advice as the\nmedicinal diet and keep my request. And if you do not keep it, surely danger\nwill befall you.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, Mandodari replied, \xc2\x93O attendant! I know\nwhatever is ordained by Fate will inevitably come to pass; for the present, I\nam not going to marry at all.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n60-61. Mahi _s_ a said :-- The female attendant, knowing this her obstinate\nview, told the King :-- \xc2\x93O King! This woman likes not a good husband; you\nwould better go wherever you like.\xc2\x94 The King heard and did not want to marry\nthat woman any more; and, being sad and broken-hearted, went back with his\narmy to Kosala.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventeenth Chapter of the Fifth Skandha on Mandodari\xc2\x92s accounts\nin the Mahapura _n_ am, S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses by Mahar\n_s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 18](bk05ch18.htm)\n\n'
