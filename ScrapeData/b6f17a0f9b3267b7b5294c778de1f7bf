The objection that (the Brahman of the former passage cannot be\nrecognised in the latter) on account of the difference of designation, is not\nvalid because in either (designation) there is nothing contrary (to the\nrecognition).\n\nThe objection that in the former passage ('three feet of it are what is\nimmortal in heaven'), heaven is designated as the abode, while in the latter\npassage ('that light which shines above this heaven'), heaven is designated as\nthe boundary, and that, on account of this difference of designation, the\nsubject-matter of the former passage cannot be recognised in the latter, must\nlikewise be refuted. This we do by remarking that in either designation\nnothing is contrary to the recognition. Just as in ordinary language a falcon,\nalthough in contact with the top of a tree, is not only said to be on the tree\nbut also above the tree, so Brahman also, although being in heaven, is here\nreferred to as being beyond heaven as well.\n\nAnother (commentator) explains: just as in ordinary language a falcon,\nalthough not in contact with the top of a\n\np. 97\n\ntree, is not only said to be above the top of the tree but also on the top of\nthe tree, so Brahman also, which is in reality beyond heaven, is (in the\nformer of the two passages) said to be in heaven. Therefore the Brahman spoken\nof in the former passage can be recognised in the latter also, and it remains\ntherefore a settled conclusion that the word 'light' denotes Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 28](sbe34034.htm)\n\n"
