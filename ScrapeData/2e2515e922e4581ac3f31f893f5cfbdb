As Brahm\xc4\x81 was Creator, Vishnu\nPreserver, in order to\n\n[![SIVA.](tn/26200.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/26200.jpg)  \nSIVA.  \n\np. 263\n\ncomplete the system, as all things are subject to decay, a Destroyer was\nnecessary; and destruction is regarded as the peculiar work of Siva. This\nseems scarcely in harmony with the form by which he is usually represented. It\nmust be remembered, however, that, according to the teaching of Hinduism,\ndeath is not death in the sense of passing into non-existence, but simply a\nchange into a new form of life. He who destroys, therefore, causes beings to\nassume new phases of existence--the Destroyer is really a re-Creator; hence\nthe name Siva, the Bright or Happy One, is given to him, which would not have\nbeen the case had he been regarded as the destroyer in the ordinary meaning of\nthat term.\n\nIn the later Hinduism, as taught in the Epics and Pur\xc4\x81nas, Siva plays a most\nimportant part, several books having been written for the purpose of\ncelebrating his praise; yet his name as that of a god does not occur in the\nVedas. In order, therefore, to gain greater reverence for him amongst men, he\nis declared to be the Rudra of the Vedras. In some passages in the Vedras,\nRudra is identified with Agni; yet "the distinctive epithets applied to him in\nthe Rig-Veda appear sufficiently to prove that he was generally discriminated\nfrom Agni by his early worshippers." *\n\nBetween the texts from the Br\xc4\x81hmanas relative to Rudra, and the earliest\ndescriptions of the same deity which we discover in the Epic poems, a wide\nchasm intervenes, which, as far as I am aware, no genuine ancient materials\nexist for bridging over. The Rudra of the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata is not indeed very\ndifferent in his general character from the god of the same name who is\nportrayed in the Satarudriya, but in the later literature his importance is\nimmensely increased, his attributes are\n\np. 264\n\n[![SIVA TEMPLE AT BENARES.](tn/26400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/26400.jpg)  \nSIVA TEMPLE AT BENARES.  \n\np. 265\n\nmore clearly defined, and the conceptions entertained of his person are\nrendered more distinct by the addition of various additional features and\nillustrated by numerous legends. Instead of remaining a subordinate deity, as\nhe was in the Vedic Age, Rudra has thrown Agni, V\xc4\x81yu, Surya, Mitra, and Varuna\ncompletely into the shade; and although Indra still occupies a prominent place\nin the Epic legends, he bas sunk down into a subordinate position, and is\nquite unable to compete in power and dignity with Rudra, who, together with\nVishnu, now engrosses the almost exclusive worship of the Br\xc4\x81hmanical world."\n*\n\nIn the following texts from the Vedas, \xe2\x80\xa0 referring to Rudra, will be seen the\ngerms of some of the legends found in the later books concerning Siva:--"What\ncan we utter to Rudra, the intelligent, the strong, the most bountiful, which\nshall be most pleasant to his heart, that so Aditi may bring Rudra\'s healing\nto our cattle, and men, and kine, and children? We seek from Rudra, the lord\nof songs, the lord of sacrifices, who possesses healing remedies, his\nauspicious favour; from him who is brilliant as the sun, who shines like gold,\nwho is the best and most bountiful of the gods." "We invoke with obeisance the\nruddy boar of the sky, with spirally braided hair, a brilliant form." "Far be\nfrom us thy cow-slaying and man-slaying weapon." In the same hymn Rudra is\ncalled the father of the Maruts or Storm-gods; to explain which the\ncommentator introduces a legend of a later date which is found in the account\nof the Maruts. \xe2\x80\xa1 In another hymn Rudra is thus addressed: "Thou fitly holdest\narrows and a bow; fitly thou [wearest] a glorious necklace of every form [of\nbeauty]."\n\np. 266\n\n[paragraph continues] The name Siva may have been connected with Rudra from a\nverse in the Vajasaneyi recension of the white "Yajur Veda," wherein Rudra is\nthus addressed: "Thou art gracious (Siva) by name." * Other epithets, which\nare afterwards extended into legends, are seen in a prayer in the same Veda:\n"Shine upon us, dweller in the mountain, with that blessed body of thine which\nis auspicious." \xe2\x80\xa0 " May he who glides away, blue-necked and red-coloured, be\ngracious unto us." "Reverence to the blue-necked, to the thousand-eyed, to the\nbountiful, and to the lord of spirits, and to the lord of thieves."\n\nIn the following account of Rudra\'s birth, he is identified with Agni:--"The\nlord of beings was a householder, and Ushas (The Dawn) was his wife. A boy was\nborn (to them) in a year. The boy wept. Praj\xc4\x81pati said to him, \'Boy, why dost\nthou weep, since thou hast been born after toil and austerity?" The boy said,\n\'My evil has not been taken away, and a name has not been given to me. Give me\na name.\' Praj\xc4\x81pati said, \'Thou art Rudra.\' Inasmuch as he gave him that name,\nAgni became his form, for Rudra is Agni. He was Rudra because he wept (from\n_rud_ , to weep)." \xe2\x80\xa1 This account of the birth of Rudra agrees with that of\nthe Vishnu and M\xc4\x81rkandeya Pur\xc4\x81nas, and to some extent with that of others.\n\nIt is impossible to give a connected account of the life of this deity. His\ncareer was not clearly defined like an Avat\xc4\x81ra of Vishnu, of which we have a\nhistory of his birth, life, and death. Though he often appeared on earth in\nhuman form, and frequently dwelt at his favourite city, Benares, his heavenly\nhome was at Kail\xc4\x81sa on the Himalayas. All that can be done is to\n\np. 267\n\ngive a few out of the many legends found in the sacred books in which his\ncharacter and works are described. From these we may learn something of the\nidea of the age in which they were written respecting Siva.\n\nRudra, according to the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana, married Um\xc4\x81, the daughter of Daksha, who\nreappears in various stages of the life of Siva as P\xc4\x81rvati, Durg\xc4\x81, K\xc4\x81li, etc.\nFearing that the children of such parents would be dangerous to live with, the\ngods entreated Siva and Um\xc4\x81 to live a life of chastity: to this they\nconsented. The request, however, came too late to prevent the birth of\nKartikeya. Um\xc4\x81 declared that the wives of the other gods should also be\nchildless. Rudra took a prominent position at the churning of the ocean; he\ndrank the poison, as nectar, that was produced before the amrita, which caused\nhis neck to become dark-coloured--hence one of his names is Nilkanta, "the\nblue-necked."\n\nAs Um\xc4\x81 was sitting with her husband in their home on Mount Kailasa, seeing the\ngods driving by in their chariots, she was told that they were proceeding, at\nher father\'s invitation, to take part in a great sacrifice he was about to\nmake. As Siva had offended him, Daksha had not invited him. The "Bh\xc4\x81gavata\nPur\xc4\x81na" * gives the cause of this slight upon Siva: "On one occasion the gods\nand Rishis were assembled at a sacrifice celebrated by the Praj\xc4\x81patis. On\nDaksha\'s entrance, all rose to salute him excepting his father Brahm\xc4\x81 and\nMah\xc4\x81deva (Siva). Daksha, after making his obeisance to Brahm\xc4\x81, sat down by his\ncommand, but was offended at the treatment he received from Siva. Seeing him\npreviously seated, Daksha did not brook this want of respect; but looking at\nhim obliquely with his eyes, as if consuming him, thus spake: \'Hear me, ye\nBr\xc4\x81hman\n\np. 268\n\n[paragraph continues] Rishis, with the gods and the Agnis, while I, neither\nfrom ignorance nor passion, describe what is the practice of virtuous persons.\nBut this shameless being (Siva) detracts from the reputation of the guardians\nof the world--he by whom, stubborn as he is, the course pursued by the good is\ntransgressed. He assumed the position of my disciple, inasmuch as, like a\nvirtuous person, in the face of Br\xc4\x81hmans and of fire, he took the hand of my\ndaughter who resembled Savitri. This monkey-eyed [god], after having taken the\nhand of [my] fawn-eyed [daughter], has not even by word shown suitable respect\nto me, whom he ought to have risen and saluted. Though unwilling, I yet gave\nmy daughter to this impure and proud abolisher of rites and demolisher of\nbarriers, like the word of a Veda to a Sudra. He roams about in dreadful\ncemeteries, attended by hosts of ghosts and sprites, like a madman, naked,\nwith dishevelled hair, wearing a garland of dead men\'s [skulls] and ornaments\nof human bones, pretending to be Siva (auspicious), but in reality Asiva\n(inauspicious), insane, beloved by the insane, the lord of Bhutas (spirits),\nbeings whose nature is essentially darkness. To this wicked-hearted lord of\nthe infuriate, whose purity has perished, I have, alas! given my virtuous\ndaughter, at the instigation of Brahm\xc4\x81.\' Having thus reviled Siva, who did not\noppose him, Daksha, having touched water, incensed, began to curse him: \'Let\nthis Bhava (Siva), lowest of the gods, never at the worship of the gods\nreceive any portion along with the gods Indra, Upendra (Vishnu), and others.\'\n\n"Daksha then left the assembly. After his departure a follower of Mah\xc4\x81deva\npronounced a curse upon him, and the Br\xc4\x81hmans who sympathized with him: \'Let\nDaksha, brutal, be excessively devoted to women, and\n\np. 269\n\nhave speedily the head of a goat. Let this stupid being continue to exist in\nthis world in ceremonial ignorance!\' Upon this, Bhrigu (a brother of Daksha,\nand a Rishi) launched a counter-curse upon the followers of Siva: \'Let those\nwho practise the rites of Bhava be heretics and opponents of the true\nscriptures. Having lost their purity, deluded in understanding, wearing matted\nhair and ashes and bones, let them undergo the initiation of Siva, in which\nspirituous liquors are the deity.\' Hearing this imprecation, Siva and his\nfollowers left the assembly, while Daksha and the other Praj\xc4\x81patis *\ncelebrated for a thousand years the sacrifice in which Vishnu was the object\nof veneration."\n\nThe enmity thus commenced between Siva and Daksha continued; and in\nconsequence, at the great sacrifice made when his father-in-law was appointed\nchief of the Praj\xc4\x81patis, Siva was not invited. Um\xc4\x81 was greatly grieved, as her\nhusband told her, "The former practice of the gods has been that in all\nsacrifices no portion should be divided to me. By custom, established by the\nearliest arrangement, the gods lawfully allot me no share in the sacrifice."\nAccording to the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata, he then sets off for the assembly and with his\nattendants puts an end to the sacrifice, which, taking the form of a deer, is\nfollowed by Siva into the sky. A drop of perspiration falls from his forehead,\nfrom which a fire proceeds, out of which issues a dreadful being Jvara\n(Fever), which burns up the other things prepared for the sacrifice, and even\nputs to flight the gods. Brahm\xc4\x81, now appears to Siva, promises that the gods\nshall henceforth give him a share in the sacrifices, and proposes that Jvara\nshall be allowed to range over the earth.\n\np. 270\n\nThe Bh\xc4\x81gavata * gives a more lengthy and somewhat different account of the\ntermination of Daksha\'s ceremony. Sati (Um\xc4\x81) was most anxious to attend it.\nThough her husband tries to dissuade her, she "disregards his warning and\ngoes; but, being slighted by her father, reproaches him for his hostility to\nher husband, and threatens to abandon her corporeal frame by which she was\nconnected with her parent. She then voluntarily gives up the ghost. Seeing\nthis, Siva\'s attendants, who had followed, rush on Daksha to slay him." This,\nhowever, is prevented, and Siva\'s followers are put to flight. When Siva heard\nof his wife\'s death, he was greatly angered, and "from a lock of his hair a\ngigantic demon arose (named Virabhadra), whom he commanded to destroy Daksha\nand his sacrifice." This was accomplished. He plucked out Bhrigu\'s beard, tore\nout Bhaga\'s eyes, knocked out Pushan\'s teeth, and cut off Daksha\'s head. In\ntheir distress, the gods are advised to propitiate Siva. For this purpose they\nresort to Kail\xc4\x81sa, where they see Siva "carrying the linga desired by\ndevotees, ashes, a staff, a tuft of hair, an antelope\'s skin, and a digit of\nthe moon, his body shining like an evening cloud." Siva in part relents, and\nallows Daksha to have a goat\'s head: the sacrifice is completed, and Vishnu\ngives an address in which he shows that he is the supreme deity, and that the\ntroubles of his worshippers arise from imagining themselves to be different\nfrom him. Daksha himself worships Siva, and Um\xc4\x81, who had voluntarily given up\nherself to the flames, and thus become a _Sati_ , \xe2\x80\xa0\n\np. 271\n\nwas re-born as P\xc4\x81rvati, being then the daughter of Himavat, the god of the\nHim\xc4\x81layas and Men\xc4\x81.\n\nSiva adopted the garb, and lived the life of an ascetic. Though generally\nworshipped under the form of the linga, he "is represented in human form,\nliving in the Him\xc4\x81layas along with P\xc4\x81rvati, sometimes in the act of trampling\non or destroying demons, wearing round his black neck a serpent, and a\nnecklace of skulls, and furnished with a whole apparatus of external emblems,\nsuch as a white bull on which he rides, a trident, tiger\'s skin, elephant\'s\nskin, rattle, noose, etc. He has three eyes, one being in his forehead, in\nallusion either to the three Vedas, or time past, present and future. He has a\ncrescent on his forehead, the moon having been given to him as his share of\nthe products of the churning of the ocean. Again, Mah\xc4\x81deva, or the great deity\nSiva, is sometimes connected with humanity in another personification very\ndifferent from that just noted, viz. that of an austere ascetic, with matted\nhair, living in a forest and teaching men by his own example, first, the power\nto be obtained by penance (tapas), mortification of the body and suppression\nof the passions; and, secondly, the great virtue of abstract meditation, as\nleading to the loftiest spiritual knowledge, and ultimately to union, or\nactual identification with the great spirit of the universe." *\n\nThe following legend from the "V\xc4\x81mana Pur\xc4\x81na," \xe2\x80\xa0 describes the ordinary life\nof Siva as an ascetic. Devi (P\xc4\x81rvati), oppressed with violent heat, thus\naddressed her lord: "O Isha! the heat increases in violence; hast thou no\nhouse to which we might repair, and there abide, protected from the wind, the\nheat, the cold?"\n\np. 272\n\n[paragraph continues] Sankara replied: "I am, O lovely one, without a shelter,\na constant wanderer in forests." Having thus spoken, Sankara with Sati\nremained during the hot season under the shade of trees, and when it was\npassed, the rainy season with its dark clouds succeeded. On beholding which,\nSati said to Siva, "Heart-agitating winds do blow, O Maheshwara, and rushing\ntorrents roar; let me entreat thee to build a house on Kail\xc4\x81sa, where I may\nabide with thee in comfort." Siva replied, "O my beloved, I have no riches for\nthe erection of a house, nor am I possessor of aught else than an elephant\'s\nskin for a garment, and serpents for my ornaments." The soul of Siva, having\nheard these harsh words, seemingly true, but devoid of truth, was alarmed, and\nlooking on the ground with bashfulness and anger said, "Then say, O Sambhu,\nhow can we pass in comfort the rainy season under the shade of trees?" Siva\nreplied, "With our bodies covered with a cloud, O lovely one, shall the rainy\nseason pass without any rain falling on thy tender frame." Having thus spoken,\nSiva stopped a cloud, and with the daughter of Daksha, fixed his abode within\nit, and hence has he since been celebrated in heaven under the name of Jimula-\nKitu (he whose banner is a cloud). When the rains were over, they took up\ntheir abode in Mount Mandara.\n\nThe home life of Siva and his spouse does not appear to have been of the\nhappiest. As they could each bestow gifts upon their worshippers, it sometimes\nhappened that the one wanted to bless those whom the other wished to curse. In\nthe R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana and Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata * is an account of a dispute between them in\nconnection with the struggle between R\xc4\x81ma and R\xc4\x81vana. In the earlier part of\nthe contest, R\xc4\x81ma being unable\n\np. 273\n\nto overthrow his enemy because of the assistance afforded him by Siva, the\ngods whom R\xc4\x81vana had oppressed went, with R\xc4\x81ma at their head, to ask him to\nwithdraw his help. Siva consented to accompany them on the seventh day of the\nconflict to witness the destruction of their foe. Durg\xc4\x81 (P\xc4\x81rvati) severely\nreproached her husband, asking how he could witness the destruction of his own\nworshipper, a worshipper who had stood praying to him in the most sultry\nweather surrounded by four fires; who had continued his devotions in the\nchilling cold, standing in water; and had persevered in his applications,\nstanding on his head, amid torrents of rain. She then poured forth a torrent\nof abuse, calling him a withered old man, who smoked intoxicating herbs, lived\nin cemeteries and covered himself with ashes, and asked if he thought she\nwould accompany him on such an errand. Siva now gets angry, and reminds his\nwife that she was only a woman and therefore could know nothing; and further\nthat she does not act like a woman, because she too wandered about from place\nto place, engaged in war, was a drunkard, spent her time in the company of\ndegraded beings, killed giants, drank their blood and hung their skulls around\nher neck. Durg\xc4\x81 became so enraged at these reproaches, that the gods were\nfrightened. They entreated R\xc4\x81ma to join them in supplication to her, or R\xc4\x81vana\nwould never be destroyed. He did so; she then became propitious and consented\nto the destruction of the demon. Durg\xc4\x81 is represented in the Sivop\xc4\x81khyana as\nbeing exceedingly jealous because her husband, in his begging excursions,\nvisited the quarters of the town inhabited by women of ill-fame, and in the\nR\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana is an account of a terrible quarrel between them because Parasur\xc4\x81ma\nbeat her sons Kartikeya and Ganesa.\n\np. 274\n\nIn the "V\xc4\x81mana Pur\xc4\x81na" * is a legend explaining why Siva adopted the dress and\nhabits of a religious mendicant. Formerly, when all things had been destroyed,\nand naught remained but one vast ocean, that lord who is incomprehensible\n(Brahm\xc4\x81) reposed in slumber for a thousand years. When the night had passed,\ndesirous of creating the three worlds, the skilled in the Vedas, investing\nhimself with the quality of impurity, assumed a corporeal form with five heads\n(Brahm\xc4\x81). Then also was produced from the quality of darkness another form\nwith three eyes, and twisted locks, and bearing a rosary and a trident. Brahm\xc4\x81\nnext created Ahankara (consciousness of individual existence), which\nimmediately pervaded the nature of both gods; and under its influence Rudra\nsaid to Brahm\xc4\x81, "Say, O lord? how earnest thou hither, and by whom wert thou\ncreated?" Brahm\xc4\x81 asks in return, "And where have you come from?" The result is\na terrible quarrel, in which Siva, inflamed with anger, cut off the fifth head\nof Brahm\xc4\x81, which had uttered the boastful words. But when Siva tried to throw\nthe head to the ground it would not fall, but remained in his hand. Brahm\xc4\x81\nthen created a giant to slay Siva in his weakened state, which was caused by\nthe sin of injuring Brahm\xc4\x81, the father of Br\xc4\x81hmans. To escape from him Siva\nfled to Benares. The peculiar sanctity of Benares arises from the fact that it\nwas there Siva became absolved from his great sin, and was freed from the\ndissevered head of Brahm\xc4\x81, which, as a penance, he was doomed to carry with\nhim wherever he went. It was his attempts to get free from the sin of\nBr\xc4\x81hmanicide that made Siva a wandering mendicant.\n\nThe ordinary name by which Siva is known is\n\np. 275\n\n[paragraph continues] Mah\xc4\x81deva, the great god; the origin of this is taught in\nthe Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata. * The asuras had a boon bestowed by Brahm\xc4\x81, that they should\npossess three castles which could be "destructible only by the deity who was\nable to overthrow them by a single arrow." Owing to this defence, they became\nhateful to the other gods, who, in their distress, went to Brahm\xc4\x81, and he\nagain conducts them to Mah\xc4\x81deva. Siva tells them that he alone cannot destroy\nthese castles, but that with the aid of half his strength, they themselves\nwould be able to accomplish this. They answered that as they could not sustain\nhalf his strength, they proposed that he should undertake the work aided by\nhalf their strength. Mah\xc4\x81deva consented to this, and thus became stronger than\nall the gods, and was thenceforward called Mah\xc4\x81deva. Notwithstanding this, in\nthe account of Parasur\xc4\x81ma a legend is given in which Vishnu\'s superiority to\nSiva is shown; whilst in the Pur\xc4\x81nas devoted to Siva\'s praise it is distinctly\naffirmed that Brahm\xc4\x81 and Vishnu are inferior to him.\n\nThe unity of the various deities is taught in the following legend. \xe2\x80\xa0 As\nLakshmi and Durg\xc4\x81 were sitting together in the presence of Siva, Lakshmi\ncontended that her husband (Vishnu) was greater than Siva, because Siva had\nworshipped him. As they were conversing, Vishnu himself appeared, and, in\norder to convince his wife that he and Siva were equal, entered his body, and\nthey became one. Another form of this story is found in the "Skanda Pur\xc4\x81na." \xe2\x80\xa1\nSiva asked Vishnu on one occasion to assume the form of a beautiful woman,\nsuch as he did at the churning of the ocean to attract the attention of the\nasuras whilst the gods drank the amrita. Vishnu consenting, Siva became\n\np. 276\n\nexcited and sought to embrace her. As Vishnu ran away, Siva followed him, and\nthough Vishnu resumed his proper form, Siva clasped him so tightly that their\n\n[![HAR-HARI.](tn/27600.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/27600.jpg)  \nHAR-HARI.  \n\nbodies became one, and a name Har-Hari, is given to the deities thus united.\n\nSiva is always represented as having a third eye situated in the middle of his\nforehead; the reason of\n\np. 277\n\nthis peculiarity is given in the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata. * As he was seated on the\nHimalayas, where he had been engaged in austerities, Um\xc4\x81, attended by her\ncompanions, and dressed as an ascetic, came behind him and playfully put her\nhands over his eyes. The effect was tremendous. Suddenly the world became\ndark, lifeless and destitute of oblations. The gloom, however, is as suddenly\ndispelled. A great flame burst from Mah\xc4\x81deva\'s forehead, in which a third eye,\nluminous as the sun, was formed. By fire from this eye the mountain was\nscorched, and everything upon it consumed. \'Lima hereupon stands in a\nsubmissive attitude before her husband, and in a moment, the Him\xc4\x81laya, her\nfather, is restored to his former condition.\n\nEach god is represented as having special fondness for some bird or animal, on\nwhich he is supposed to travel, and which therefore is called his V\xc4\x81han or\nvehicle. The bull is Siva\'s; and the image of his favourite bull, Nandi, is\nseen in front of many of the shrines sacred to Mah\xc4\x81deva. Owing probably to\nthis circumstance, a curious custom prevails, similar in many respects to the\nsetting loose of the scapegoat by the Israelites. At the death of a worshipper\nof Siva, if his friends are pious and can afford it, they set a bullock loose,\nand allow it to wander at will. By the Hindus generally it is considered a\nmeritorious act to feed these sacred bulls, and a sin to injure them. In\ncountry places many of them are seen, and they become a great nuisance to the\ncultivators into whose fields they wander; for though they do much damage, as\nthey have no owner, no compensation can be obtained. If a man were specially\ndevout, or his friends eminently pious, as many as seven bulls are set loose\nat his decease.\n\np. 278\n\nThe idea seems to be this: as Siva was delighted with Nandi, he will\ngraciously receive into his presence those on whose behalf these bullocks are\ngiven.\n\nAs Siva himself lived the life of an ascetic, and practised severe penance, a\nsimilar life is supposed to be pleasing to him; hence many of the Saivites, or\nworshippers of Siva, practise great austerities, and resort to cruel rites as\na means of gaining his favour. Wandering through the country are tens of\nthousands of Sany\xc4\x81sis, or pilgrims, who subsist upon charity, and expose\nthemselves to cold and heat and many discomforts, in the belief that their\nlife is pleasing to this deity. Some of them inflict upon themselves great\nphysical pain by retaining their arms or legs in one posture for years, until\nit has become impossible to move them; others allow the thumb nail to grow\nthrough their finger; others gaze into the sun until they become blind; others\nagain impose upon themselves a vow of silence, until at length they cannot\nspeak. At certain festivals held in his honour, the lower orders of the people\nused to swing from bamboos, having iron hooks forced into their bodies, whilst\nothers threw themselves from a height upon sharp knives; at the present time,\nthough these cruel practices are prohibited by the Government, in out-of-the-\nway places they are still carried on. To assist them to bear the pain, an\nintoxicating drug made from hemp is freely indulged in; the authority for this\npractice being the life of the god, as described in the Pur\xc4\x81nas. As Krishna is\nbelieved to be pleased with songs and dances, not always of a highly moral\ncharacter, Siva is believed to delight in the cruel practices of his ignorant\nand intoxicated worshippers.\n\nThe following extract from the Bh\xc4\x81gavata, descriptive of Siva\'s appearance and\nconduct, countenances much\n\np. 279\n\nthat now forms part of his worship. Understanding that one of his worshippers\nwas in distress, Siva\n\n[![SIVA SLAYING AN ASURA.](tn/27900.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/27900.jpg)  \nSIVA SLAYING AN ASURA.  \n\n[paragraph continues] "assumed half the body of P\xc4\x81rvati, fastened up his\nmatted hair, rubbed his body over with ashes, ate a large quantity of hemp,\nswallow-wort and thorn-apple;\n\np. 280\n\nand wearing a Br\xc4\x81hmanical thread composed of white snakes, clad in an\nelephant\'s hide, with a necklace of beads, and a garland of skulls, riding\nupon Nandi, accompanied by ghosts, goblins, spectres, witches, imps, sprites\nand evil spirits, Bholon\xc4\x81th came forth. On his forehead was the moon; he\nplaced the Ganges on his head, * and his eyes were very red. His most\ndestructive weapon was a trident: with this he slew the foe who was obnoxious\nto his follower."\n\nThough Siva\'s appearance is repeatedly described with considerable minuteness\nin the Pur\xc4\x81nas, and in pictures he is usually represented in the human form,\nit is in the form of the Linga that he is almost universally worshipped. This\nimage does not suggest anything offensive to those unacquainted with its\nsymbolic meaning, and some writers speak of its being innocuous to the Hindus\nthemselves. But it is impossible for any one acquainted with the legends which\naccount for its being the symbol of Siva, to see and worship it without impure\nthoughts being suggested. It is intended to represent the male and female\nreproductive organs.\n\nSeveral legends are given to explain how it came to be the representative of\nSiva. The probability is that it was an object of worship of some aboriginal\ntribe, incorporated into Hinduism. The "Padma Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0 teaches that it was\nthe result of a curse pronounced by Bhrigu. When that Sage was sent to\ndiscover which of the three gods was the greatest, he came to Siva\'s abode,\nbut was prevented from entering immediately he arrived by a doorkeeper, who\ninformed him that his master was with Devi his wife. After waiting for some\ntime, Bhrigu\'s patience being exhausted, he said, "Since thou, O\n\np. 281\n\n[paragraph continues] Sankara! hast treated me with contempt, in preferring\nthe embraces of P\xc4\x81rvati, your forms of worship shall be the Linga and Yoni."\n\nThe V\xc4\x81mana * makes it the result of a curse pronounced by a number of Sages.\nWhen Sati died at Daksha\'s sacrifice, Siva wandered from place to place like a\nmadman, mourning her absence. He travelled from hermitage to hermitage, but\ncould find no rest. When the hermits\' wives saw him they fell desperately in\nlove with him and followed him from place to place. Their husbands, incensed\nat this, cursed the god, and deprived him of his manhood. A great commotion\nfollowed. Brahm\xc4\x81 and Vishnu interceded on his behalf with the hermits, who\nconsented to withdraw their curse on condition that the offender should be\nrepresented by the Linga; and thus it became an object of worship to gods and\nmen.\n\nAs a specimen of the legends by which the worship of Siva under this form is\ninculcated, I give the following extract from the "Siva Pur\xc4\x81na." \xe2\x80\xa0 A R\xc4\x81kshas\nnamed Bh\xc4\xabma, have obtained invincible might as a boon from R\xc4\x81ma, commenced\nexerting his newly acquired power by attacking the king of K\xc4\x81mrupa. Having\nconquered the king, and seized his kingdom and riches, he placed him in chains\nin a solitary prison. The king, being eminently pious, notwithstanding his\nconfinement, continued daily to make clay figures of the Linga, and to worship\nSiva with all the prescribed rites and ceremonies. Meanwhile the R\xc4\x81kshas\ncontinued his conquests, and everywhere abolished religious observances, and\nthe worship enjoined in the Vedas. The gods being reduced by his power to\ngreat distress, appealed to Siva for help, and propitiated him by the worship\nof clay Lingas.\n\np. 282\n\n[paragraph continues] S\xc4\x81mbhu assured them that he would effect the destruction\nof their enemy by means of the king of K\xc4\x81mrupa, then a prisoner. At this very\nmoment the prisoner was engaged in profound meditation before a Linga, when\none of the guards, seeing him thus occupied, went and informed the R\xc4\x81kshas\nthat his captive was performing some improper ceremonies in order to injure\nhim. Hearing this, the monster, enraged, seized his sword and hastening to the\nprison, thus addressed the king: "Speak the truth, and tell me who it is that\nthou worshippest, and I will not slay thee; otherwise I will instantly put\nthee to death!"\n\nThe king, placing firm reliance on the protection of Siva, undauntedly\nreplied, "In truth, I worship Sankara; do then what thou pleasest!" The\nR\xc4\x81kshas asked, "What can Sankara do to me? I know him well, that he was once\nobliged to become the servant of my uncle (R\xc4\x81vana); and thou trusting in his\npower didst endeavour to conquer me; but defeat was the result of thy attempt.\nHowever, until thou showest me thy lord, and convincest me of his might, I\nwill not believe in his divinity!" The king replied, "Vile as I am, what power\nhave I over the god? But mighty as he is, I know he will never forsake me!" To\nwhich the R\xc4\x81kshas said, "How can that delighter in ganja, and inebriation,\nthat wandering mendicant, protect his worshippers? Let but thy lord appear,\nand I will immediately engage with him in battle." He then ordered the\nattendance of his army; and reviling the king, the mighty R\xc4\x81kshas smiting the\nLinga with his sword, said, laughing, "Now, behold the power of thy lord!"\nScarcely had his sword touched the Linga than Hara issued from it, and\nexclaimed, "Behold I am Iswara (god), who appears for the protection of his\n\np. 283\n\nworshipper, on whom he always bestows safety and happiness; now learn to dread\nmy might!" Siva then attacked the R\xc4\x81kshas, and with the glory which issued\nfrom his third eye, consumed him and his army to ashes.\n\nSiva is said to have a thousand names; in addition to those already mentioned\nthe following are most common:--\n\nMaheswara, "The great god."\n\nIshwar, "The glorious."\n\nChandrashekara, "He who wears a half-moon on his forehead."\n\nBhuteswara, "Lord of Bhuts, or goblins."\n\nMritunjaya, "He who conquers death."\n\nSri Kanta, "He whose neck is beautiful."\n\nSmarah\xc4\x81ra, "The destroyer of Smara or K\xc4\x81mdeva."\n\nGangadhara, "He who holds Gang\xc4\x81 (the Ganges) in his hair."\n\nSth\xc4\x81nu, "The everlasting."\n\nGirisha, "The lord of the hills."\n\nDigambara, "He who is clothed with space (naked)."\n\nBhagavat, "The lord."\n\nIs\xc4\x81na, "The ruler."\n\nMahak\xc4\x81la, "The great time."\n\nTryambaka, "The three-eyed."\n\n##### PANCH\xc4\x80NANA.\n\nThis is a form of Siva in which he is represented, as his name teaches, with\nfive faces; the appearance of his body and the ascetic\'s dress being the same\nas in his ordinary forms. It is under this name that prayers for recovery from\nsickness are addressed to him as the physician or healer. In places where\nthere is no temple, and no image of this deity, worship is offered to him\nbefore a shapeless stone, painted red, placed under a\n\np. 284\n\ntree. This is a very common form of worship in the villages of Bengal. Some\nshrines of Panch\xc4\x81nana have acquired considerable celebrity, to which women\nresort to obtain the gift of children as well as other blessings. In times of\nsickness offerings are made to this deity\n\n[![PANCH\xc4\x80NANA.](tn/28400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/28400.jpg)  \nPANCH\xc4\x80NANA.  \n\nwithout scruple, though the sufferer is not ordinarily a worshipper of Siva.\nIn cases of epilepsy it is the common belief that the victim is possessed by\nPanch\xc4\x81nana, and offerings are made to induce him to depart; recovery is.\nbelieved to be the result of the god\'s departure.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[263:*](hmvp33.htm#fr_234) Muir, O.
