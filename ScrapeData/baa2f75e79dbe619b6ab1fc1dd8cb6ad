Let us now proclaim for the robust [1](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:1:1) host, for\nthe herald [2](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:1:2) of the powerful (Indra), their\nancient greatness! O ye strong-voiced Maruts, you heroes, prove your powers on\nyour march, as with a torch, as with a sword [3](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:1:3)!\n\n2\\. Like parents bringing a dainty to [1](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:2:1) their own\n[2](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:2:2) son, the wild (Maruts) play playfully at the\nsacrifices. The Rudras reach the worshipper with their protection, strong in\nthemselves, they do not fail the sacrificer.\n\n3\\. For him to whom the immortal guardians have given fulness of wealth, and\nwho is himself a giver of oblations, the Maruts, who gladden men with the milk\n(of rain), pour out, like friends, many clouds.\n\n4\\. You who have stirred [1](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:4:1) up the clouds with\nmight, your horses rushed [2](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:4:2) forth, self-guided.\nAll beings who dwell in houses [3](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:4:3) are afraid of\nyou, your march is brilliant with your spears thrust forth.\n\n5\\. When they whose march is terrible have caused the rocks to tremble\n[1](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:5:1), or when the manly Maruts have shaken the back\nof heaven, then every lord of the forest fears at your racing, each shrub\nflies out of your way [2](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:5:2), whirling like chariot-\nwheels [3](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:5:3).\n\n6\\. You, O terrible Maruts, whose ranks are never broken, favourably\n[1](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:1) fulfil our prayer [2](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:2)!\nWherever your gory-toothed [3](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:3) lightning bites\n[4](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:4), it crunches [5](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:5)\ncattle, like a well-aimed bolt [6](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:6).\n\np. 210\n\n7\\. The Maruts whose gifts are firm, whose bounties are never ceasing, who do\nnot: revile [1](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:7:1), and who are highly praised at the\nsacrifices, they sing their song [2](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:7:2) for to drink\nthe sweet juice: they know the first manly deeds of the hero (Indra).\n\n8\\. The man whom you have guarded, O Maruts,--shield him with hundredfold\nstrongholds from injury [1](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:8:1) and mischief,--the man\nwhom you, O fearful, powerful singers, protect from reproach in the prosperity\nof his children.\n\n9\\. On your chariots, O Maruts, there are all good things, strong weapons\n[1](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:9:1) are piled up clashing against each other. When\nyou are on your journeys, you carry the rings [2](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:9:2) on\nyour shoulders, and your axle turns the two wheels at once\n[3](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:9:3).\n\n10\\. In their manly arms there are many good things, on their chests golden\nchains [1](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:10:1), flaring [2](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:10:2)\nornaments, on their shoulders speckled deer-skins\n[3](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:10:3), on their fellies sharp edges\n[4](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:10:4); as birds spread their wings, they spread out\nsplendours behind.\n\n11\\. They, mighty by might, all-powerful powers\n[1](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:11:1), visible from afar like the heavens\n[2](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:11:2) with the stars, sweet-toned, soft-tongued\nsingers with their mouths [3](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:11:3), the Maruts, united\nwith Indra, shout all around.\n\n12\\. This is your greatness [1](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:1) O well-born Maruts!\n--your bounty [3](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:3) extends far, as the sway\n[2](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:2) of Aditi [4](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:4). Not\neven [5](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:5) Indra in his scorn\n[6](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:6) can injure that bounty, on whatever man you\nhave bestowed it for his good deeds.\n\n13\\. This is your kinship (with us), O Maruts, that you, immortals, in former\nyears have often protected the singer [1](sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:13:1). Having\nthrough this prayer granted a hearing to man, all these heroes together have\nbecome well-known by their valiant deeds.\n\np. 211\n\n14\\. That we may long flourish, O Maruts, with your wealth, O ye racers, that\nour men may spread in the camp, therefore let me achieve the rite with these\nofferings.\n\n15\\. May this praise, O Maruts, this song of Mandarya, the son of Mana, the\npoet, ask you with food for offspring for ourselves! May we have an\ninvigorating autumn, with quickening rain!\n\np. 212\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThis hymn is ascribed to Agastya, the reputed son of Mitravaru _n_ au, and\nbrother of Vasish _th_ a. The metre in verses 1-13 is _G_ agati, in 14, 15\nTrish _t_ ubh. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Rabhasa, an adjective of rabhas, and this again from the root rabh, to\nrush upon a thing, a-rabh, to begin a thing. From this root rabh we have the\nLatin robur, in the general sense of strength, while in rabies the original\nmeaning of impetuous motion has been more clearly preserved. The Greek \xce\xbb\xce\xac\xce\xb2\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82,\ntoo, as pointed out by Cowell, comes from this root. In the Vedic Sanskrit,\nderivatives from the root rabh convey the meaning both of quickness and of\nstrength. Quickness in ancient languages frequently implies strength, and\nstrength implies quickness, as we see, for instance, from the German snel,\nwhich, from meaning originally strong, comes to mean in modern German quick,\nand quick only. The German bald again, meaning soon, comes from the Gothic\nbalths, the English bold. Thus we read:\n\nI, 145, 3. _s_ i _s_ u _h_ a\xc2\xb4 adatta sam rabha _h_.\n\nThe child (Agni) acquired vigour.\n\nIndra is called rabha _h_ -da\xc2\xb4 _h_ , giver of strength; and rabhasa, vigorous,\nis applied not only to the Maruts, who in V, 58, 5, are called rabhish _th_ a\n_h_ , the most vigorous, but also to Agni, II, 10, 4, and to Indra, III, 31,\n12.\n\nIn the sense of rabid, furious, it occurs in\n\nX, 95, 14. adha enam v _r i_ka _h_ rabhasa\xc2\xb4sa _h_ adyu _h_.\n\nMay rabid wolves eat him!\n\nIn the next verse rabhasa, the epithet of the wolves, is replaced by a _s_\niva, which means unlucky, uncanny.\n\nIn our hymn rabhasa occurs once more, and is applied there, in verse 10, to\nthe a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ i or glittering ornaments of the Maruts. Here Saya _n_ a\ntranslates it by lovely, and it was most likely intended to convey the idea of\nlively or brilliant splendour, though it may mean also strong. See also IX,\n96, 1.\n\np. 213\n\nNote 2. Ketu, derived from an old root ki, in Sanskrit _k_ i, to perceive,\nfrom which also _k_ itra, conspicuous, ken-speckled, beautiful, means\noriginally that by which a thing is perceived or known, whether a sign, or a\nflag, or a herald. It is the Gothic haidu, species. It then takes the more\ngeneral sense of light and splendour. In our passage, herald seems to me the\nmost appropriate rendering, though B. and R. prefer the sense of banner. The\nMaruts come before Indra, they announce the arrival of Indra, they are the\nfirst of his army.\n\nNote 3. The real difficulty of our verse lies in the two comparisons\naidha\xc2\xb4-iva and yudha\xc2\xb4-iva. Neither of them occurs again in the Rig-veda. B.\nand R. explain aidha\xc2\xb4 as an instrumental of aidh, flaming, or flame, and\nderive it from the root idh, to kindle, with the preposition a. Professor\nBollensen in his excellent article Zur Herstellung des Veda (Orient and\nOccident, vol. iii, p. 473) says: \'The analysis of the text given in the Pada,\nviz. aidha\xc2\xb4-iva and yudha\xc2\xb4-iva, is contrary to all sense. The common predicate\nis tavisha\xc2\xb4 _n_ i kartana, exercise your power, you roarers, i. e. blow as if\nyou meant to kindle the fire on the altar, show your power as if you went to\nbattle. We ought therefore to read aidhe va and yudhe | va. Both are\ninfinitives, aidh is nothing but the root idh + a, to kindle, to light.\' Now\nthis is certainly a very ingenious explanation, but it rests on a supposition\nwhich I cannot consider as proved, viz. that in the Veda, as in Pali, the\ncomparative particle iva may be changed, as shown in the preface to the first\nedition, to va. It must be admitted that the two short syllables of iva are\noccasionally counted in the Veda as one, but yudhe-iva, though it might become\nyudha iva, would never in the Veda become yudheva.\n\nAs yudha\xc2\xb4 occurs frequently in the Veda, we may begin by admitting that the\nparallel form aidh must be explained in analogy to yudha\xc2\xb4. Now yudh is a\nverbal noun and means fighting. We have the accusative yudham, I, 53, 7; the\ngenitive yudha _h_ , VIII, 27, 17; the dative yudhe, I, 61, 13; the locative\nyudhi, I, 8, 3; the instrumental yudha\xc2\xb4, I, 53, 7, &c.; loc. plur. yut-su, I,\n91, 21. As long as yudh\n\np. 214\n\nretains the general predicative meaning of fighting, some of these cases may\nbe called infinitives. But yudh soon assumes not only the meaning of battle,\nbattle-ground, but also of instrument of fighting, weapon. In another passage,\nX, 103, 2, yudha _h_ may be taken as a vocative plural, meaning fighters.\nPassages in which yudh means clearly weapon, are, for instance,\n\nV, 52, 6. a\xc2\xb4 rukmai _h_ a\xc2\xb4 yudha\xc2\xb4 nara _h_ _ri_ shva\xc2\xb4 _h_ _ri_ sh _t_ i\xc2\xb4 _h_\nas _ri_ kshata.\n\nWith their bright chains, with their weapon, the tall men have stretched forth\nthe spears.\n\nX, 55, 8. pitvi\xc2\xb4 somasya diva _h_ a\xc2\xb4 v _ri_ dhana _h_ _s_ u\xc2\xb4ra _h_ ni _h_\nyudha\xc2\xb4 adhamat dasyun.\n\nThe hero, growing, after drinking the Soma, blew away from the sky the enemies\nwith his weapon. See also X, 103, 4.\n\nI therefore take yudh in our passage also in the sense of weapon or sword,\nand, in accordance with this, I assign to aidh the meaning of torch. Whether\naidh comes from idh with the preposition a, which, after all, would only give\nedh, or whether we have in the Sanskrit aidh the same peculiar strengthening\nwhich this very root shows in Greek and Latin a, would be difficult to decide.\nThe torch of the Maruts is the lightning, the weapon the thunderbolt, and by\nboth they manifest their strength; ferro et igne, as Ludwig remarks.\n\nWilson: We proclaim eagerly, Maruts, your ancient greatness, for (the sake of\ninducing) your prompt appearance, as the indication of (the approach of) the\nshowerer (of benefits). Loud-roaring and mighty Maruts, you exert your\nvigorous energies for the advance (to the sacrifice), as if it was to battle.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. That upa can be construed with the accusative is clear from many\npassages:\n\nIII, 35, 2. upa imam ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am a\xc2\xb4 vahata _h_ indram.\n\nBring Indra to this sacrifice!\n\nI, 25, 4. vaya _h_ na vasati\xc2\xb4 _h_ upa.\n\nAs birds (fly) to their nests.\n\np. 215\n\nNote 2. Nitya, from ni + tya a, means originally what is inside, internus,\nthen what is one\'s own; and is opposed to nish _t_ ya, from nis + tya, what is\noutside, strange, or hostile. Nitya has been well compared with ni _g_ a,\nliterally eingeboren, then, like nitya, one\'s own. What is inside, or in a\nthing or place, is its own, is peculiar to it, does not move or change, and\nhence the secondary meanings of nitya, one\'s own, unchanging, eternal. Thus we\nfind nitya used in the sense of internal or domestic:\n\nI, 73, 4. tam tva nara _h_ dame a\xc2\xb4 nityam iddham agne sa _k_ anta kshitishu\ndhruva\xc2\xb4su.\n\nOur men worshipped thee, O Agni, lighted within the house in safe places.\n\nThis I believe to be a more appropriate rendering than if we take nitya in the\nsense of always, continuously lighted, or, as some propose, in the sense of\neternal, everlasting.\n\nVII, 1, 2. daksha\xc2\xb4yya _h_ ya _h_ dame a\xc2\xb4sa nitya _h_.\n\nAgni who is to be pleased within the house, i. e. as belonging to the house,\nand, in that sense, who is to be pleased always. Cf. I, 140, 7; 141, 2; X, 12,\n2, and III, 25, 5, where nitya _h_ , however, may have been intended as an\nadjective belonging to the vocative suno.\n\nMost frequently nitya occurs with sunu, I, 66, 1; 185, 2; tanaya, III, 15, 2;\nX, 39, 14; toka, II, 2, 11; api, VII, 88, 6; pati, I, 71, 1, and has always\nthe meaning of one\'s own, very much like the later Sanskrit ni _g_ a, which\nnever occurs in the Rig-veda, though it makes its appearance in the \xc3\x82tharva\n_n_ a.\n\nNish _t_ ya, extraneus, occurs three times in the Rig-veda:\n\nVI, 75, 19. ya _h_ na _h_ sva _h_ ara _n_ a _h_ ya _h_ _k_ a nish _t_ ya _h_\n_g_ igha _m_ sati.\n\nWhoever wishes to hurt us, our own friend or a stranger from without.\n\nX, 133, 5. ya _h_ na _h_ indra abhi-da\xc2\xb4sati sa-nabhi _h_ ya _h_ _k_ a nish _t_\nya _h_.\n\nHe who infests us, O Indra, whether a relative or a stranger.\n\nVIII, I, 13. ma\xc2\xb4 bhuma nish _t_ ya _h_ -iva indra tvad ara _n_ a _h_ -iva.\n\np. 216\n\nLet us not be like outsiders, O Indra, not like strangers to thee.\n\nWilson: Ever accepting the sweet (libation), as (they would) a son, they sport\nplayfully at sacrifices, demolishing (all intruders).\n\nLudwig: Wie einen nicht absterbenden Sohn das Madhu bringend.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x81vyata, a Vedic second aorist of vi (a _g_ ), to stir up, to excite.\nFrom it pravaya _n_ a, a goad, pra-vetar, a driver. The Greek \xce\xbf\xe1\xbc\xb6-\xcf\x83-\xcf\x84\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, gad-\nfly, has been referred to the same root. See Fick, Worterbuch, p. 170.\n\nRoth (Wenzel, Instrumental, p. 54) translates: \'While you quickly throw\nyourselves into the mists;\' from a verb vya.\n\nNote 2. Adhra _g_ an, from dhra _g_ , a root which, by metathesis of\naspiration, would assume the form of dra _gh_ or dragh. In Greek, the final\nmedial aspirate being hardened, reacts on the initial media, and changes it to\nt, as bahu becomes \xcf\x80\xe1\xbf\x86\xcf\x87\xcf\x85\xcf\x82, budh \xcf\x80\xcf\x85\xce\xb8, bandh, \xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xb8. This would give us \xcf\x84\xcf\x81\xce\xb5\xcf\x87, the\nGreek root for running, Goth. thrag-jan.\n\nNote 3. Harmya is used here as an adjective of bhuvana, and can only mean\nliving in houses. It does not, however, occur again in the same sense, though\nit occurs several times as a substantive, meaning house. Its original meaning\nis fire-pit, then hearth, then house, a transition of meaning analogous to\nthat of aedes. Most of the ancient nations begin their kitchen with a fire-\npit. \'They dig a hole in the ground, take a piece of the animal\'s raw hide,\nand press it down with their hands close to the sides of the hole, which thus\nbecomes a sort of pot or basin. This they fill with water, and they make a\nnumber of stones red-hot in a fire close by. The meat is put into the water,\nand the stones dropped in till the meat is boiled. Catlin describes the\nprocess as awkward and tedious, and says that since the Assinaboins had learnt\nfrom the Mandans to make pottery, and had been supplied with vessels by the\ntraders, they had entirely done away the custom, "excepting at public\nfestivals; where they seem, like all others of the human family, to take\npleasure in cherishing and perpetuating\n\np. 217\n\ntheir ancient customs a."\' This pit was called harmya b or gharma, which is\nthe Latin formus. Thus we read:\n\nVII, 56, 16. te harmye-stha\xc2\xb4 _h_ _s_ i _s_ ava _h_ na _s_ ubhra\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nThe Maruts bright like boys standing by the hearth.\n\nFrom meaning fire-pit, or hearth, harmya afterwards takes the more general\nsense of house:\n\nVII, 55, 6. tesham sam hanma _h_ aksha\xc2\xb4 _n_ i yatha idam harmyam tatha.\n\nWe shut their eyes as we shut this house (possibly, this oven).\n\nVII, 76, 2. prati _k_ i\xc2\xb4 a\xc2\xb4 agat adhi harmyebhya _h_.\n\nThe dawn comes near, over the house-tops.\n\nX, 46, 3. _g_ ata _h_ a\xc2\xb4 harmyeshu.\n\nAgni, born in the houses.\n\nX, 73, 10. manyo _h_ iyaya harmyeshu tasthau.\n\nHe came from Manyu, he remained in the houses.\n\nIn some of these passages harmya might be taken in the sense of householder;\nbut as harmya in VII, 55, 6, has clearly the meaning of a building, it seems\nbetter not to assign to it unnecessarily any new significations.\n\nIf harmya or *harma meant originally a fire-pit, then a hearth, a house, we\nsee the close connection between harma and gharma, harmya and gharmya. Thus by\nthe side of harmyesh _th_ a we find gharmyesh _th_ a (RV. X, 106, 5). We find\ngharma meaning, not only heat in general, but fire-pit, hearth; and we find\nthe same word used for what we should call the pit, a place of torture and\npunishment from which the gods save their worshippers, or into which they\nthrow the evil-doers.\n\nV, 32, 5. yuyutsantam tamasi harmye dha\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\np. 218\n\nWhen thou, Indra, hadst placed _S_ ush _n_ a, who was anxious to fight, in the\ndarkness of the pit.\n\nIn the next verse we find\n\nasurye tamasi, in the ghastly darkness.\n\nVIII, 5, 23. yuvam ka _n_ vaya nasatya api-riptaya harmye _s_ a _s_ vat uti\xc2\xb4\n_h_ da _s_ asyatha _h_.\n\nYou, Nasatyas, always grant your aid to Ka _n_ va when thrown into the pit.\n\nThis fiery pit into which Atri is thrown, and whence he, too, was saved by the\nA _s_ vins, is likewise called gharma, I, 112, 7; 119, 6; VIII, 73, 3; X, 80,\n3.\n\nLastly we find:\n\nX, 114, 10. yada\xc2\xb4 yama _h_ bhavati harmye hita _h_.\n\nWhen Yama is seated in the house, or in the nether world.\n\nWhen the Pitars, too, the spirits of the departed, the Manes, are called\ngharma-sad, this is probably intended to mean, dwelling on the hearth (X, 15,\n9 and 10), and not dwelling in the abode of Yama.\n\nKuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. ii, p. 234: \'Die ihr die Luft erfullt mit eurer Kraft,\nhervorsturmt ihr selbst-gelenkten Laufes.\'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Nad certainly means to sound, and the causative might be translated by\n\'to make cry or shriek.\' If we took parvata in the sense of cloud, we might\ntranslate, \'When you make the clouds roar;\' if we took parvata for mountain,\nwe might, with Professor Wilson, render the passage by \'When your brilliant\ncoursers make the mountains echo.\' But nad, like other roots which afterwards\ntake the meaning of sounding, means originally to vibrate, to shake; and if we\ncompare analogous passages where nad occurs, we shall see that in our verse,\ntoo, the Vedic poet undoubtedly meant nad to be taken in that sense:\n\nVIII, 20, 5. a _k_ yuta _k_ it va _h_ a _g_ man a\xc2\xb4 na\xc2\xb4nadati parvatasa _h_\nvanaspati _h_ , bhu\xc2\xb4mi _h_ ya\xc2\xb4meshu re _g_ ate.\n\nAt your racing even things that are immovable vibrate, the rocks, the lord of\nthe forest; the earth quivers on your ways. (See I, 37, 7, note I.) Grassmann\nhere translates nadayanta by erschuttern, but in VIII, 20, 5 by erdrohnt.\n\nNote 2. See I, 37, 7, note 1.\n\np. 219\n\nNote 3. Rathiyanti-iva does not occur again. Saya _n_ a explains it, like a\nwoman who wishes for a chariot, or who rides in a chariot. I join it with\noshadhi, and take it in the sense of upamanad a _k_ are (Pa _n_. III, 1, 10),\ni. e. to behave like or to be like a chariot, whether the comparison is meant\nto express simply the quickness of chariots or the whirling of their wheels.\nThe Pada has rathiyanti, whereas the more regular form is that of the Sa _m_\nhita, rathiyanti. Cf. Prati _s_ akhya, 587.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Su- _k_ etuna, the instrumental of su- _k_ etu, kindness, good-\nmindedness, favour. This word occurs in the instrumental only, and always\nrefers to the kindness of the gods; not, like sumati, to the kindness of the\nworshipper also:\n\nI, 79, 9. a\xc2\xb4 na _h_ agne su- _k_ etuna rayim vi _s_ va\xc2\xb4yu-poshasam, mar _d_\nikam dhehi _g_ ivase.\n\nGive us, O Agni, through thy favour wealth which supports our whole life, give\nus grace to live.\n\nI, 127, 11. sa _h_ na _h_ nedish _th_ am dadri _s_ ana _h_ a\xc2\xb4 bhara agne\ndevebhi _h_ sa- _k_ ana _h_ su- _k_ etuna maha _h_ raya _h_ su- _k_ etuna.\n\nThou, O Agni, seen close to us, bring to us, in union with the gods, by thy\nfavour, great riches, by thy favour!\n\nI, 159, 5. asmabhyam dyavap _ri_ thivi (iti) su- _k_ etuna rayim dhattam vasu-\nmantam _s_ ata-gvinam.\n\nGive to us, O Dyavap _ri_ thivi, by your favour, wealth, consisting of\ntreasures and many flocks.\n\nV, 51, 11. svasti dyavap _ri_ thivi (iti) su- _k_ etuna.\n\nGive us, O Dyavap _ri_ thivi, happiness through your favour!\n\nV, 64, 2. ta\xc2\xb4 bahava su- _k_ etuna pra yantam asmai ar _k_ ate.\n\nStretch out your arms with kindness to this worshipper! In one passage of the\nninth Ma _n_ _d_ ala (IX, 65, 30) we meet with su- _k_ etunam, as an\naccusative, referring to Soma, the gracious, and this would pre-suppose a\nsubstantive _k_ etuna, which, however, does not exist.\n\nNote 2. Sumati has, no doubt, in most passages in the Rig-veda, the meaning of\nfavour, the favour of the gods. \'Let us obtain your favour, let us be in your\nfavour,\' are familiar expressions of the Vedic poets. But there are also\nnumerous passages where that meaning is inapplicable, and\n\np. 220\n\nwhere, as in our passage, we must translate sumati by prayer or desire.\n\nIn the following passages sumati is clearly used in its original sense of\nfavour, blessing, or even gift:\n\nI, 73, 6 (7). su-matim bhikshama _n_ a _h_.\n\nBegging for thy favour.\n\nI, 171, 1. su-uktena bhikshe su-matim tura\xc2\xb4 _n_ am.\n\nWith a hymn I beg for the favour of the quick Maruts.\n\nI, 114, 3. a _s_ ya\xc2\xb4ma te su-matim.\n\nMay we obtain thy favour! Cf. I, 114, 9:\n\nI, 114, 4. su-matim it vayam asya a\xc2\xb4 v _ri_ _n_ imahe.\n\nWe choose his favour. Cf. III, 33, 1.\n\nI, 117, 23. sada kavi (iti) su-matim a\xc2\xb4 _k_ ake vam.\n\nI always desire your favour, O ye wise A _s_ vins.\n\nI, 156, 3. maha _h_ te vish _n_ o (iti) su-matim bha _g_ amahe.\n\nMay we, O Vish _n_ u, enjoy the favour of thee, the mighty!\n\nBhiksh, to beg, used above, is an old desiderative form of bha _g_ , and means\nto wish to enjoy.\n\nIII, 4, 1. su-matim rasi vasva _h_.\n\nThou grantest the favour of wealth.\n\nVII, 39, 1. urdhva _h_ agni _h_ su-matim vasva _h_ a _s_ ret.\n\nThe lighted fire went up for the favour of wealth. Cf. VII, 60, 11; IX, 97,\n26.\n\nIII, 57, 6. vaso (iti) ra\xc2\xb4sva su-matim vi _s_ va- _g_ anyam.\n\nGrant us, O Vasu, thy favour, which is glorious among men!\n\nVII, 100, 2. tvam vish _n_ o (iti) su-matim vi _s_ va- _g_ anyam--da _h_.\n\nMayest thou, Vish _n_ u, give thy favour, which is glorious among men!\n\nX, 11, 7. ya _h_ te agne su-matim marta _h_ akshat.\n\nThe mortal who obtained thy favour, O Agni.\n\nII, 34, 15. arva\xc2\xb4 _k_ i sa\xc2\xb4 maruta _h_ ya\xc2\xb4 va _h_ uti _h_ o (iti) su va _s_\nra\xc2\xb4-iva su-mati _h_ _g_ igatu.\n\nYour help, O Maruts, which is to usward, your favour may it come near, like a\ncow!\n\nVIII, 22, 4. asma\xc2\xb4n a _k_ _kh_ a su-mati _h_ vam _s_ ubha _h_ pati (iti) a\ndhenu _h_ -iva dhavatu.\n\nMay your favour, O A _s_ vins, hasten towards us, like a cow!\n\nBut this meaning is by no means the invariable meaning of sumati, and it will\neasily be seen that, in the following\n\np. 221\n\npassages, the word must be translated by prayer. Thus when Sarasvati is called\n(I, 3, 11) _k_ etanti su-matina\xc2\xb4m, this can only mean she who knows of the\nprayers, as before she is called _k_ odayitri\xc2\xb4 sun _r i_tanam, she who excites\nsongs of praise:\n\nI, 151, 7. a _k_ _kh_ a gira _h_ su-matim gantam asma-yu\xc2\xb4 (iti).\n\nCome towards the songs, towards the prayer, you who are longing for us. Cf. X,\n20, 10.\n\nII, 43, 3. tush _n_ i\xc2\xb4m a\xc2\xb4sina _h_ su-matim _k_ ikiddhi na _h_.\n\nSitting quiet, listen, O _S_ akuni (bird), to our prayer!\n\nV, 1, 10. a\xc2\xb4 bhandish _th_ asya su-matim _k_ ikiddhi.\n\nTake notice of the prayer of thy best praiser! Cf. V, 33, I.\n\nVII, 18, 4. a\xc2\xb4 na _h_ indra _h_ su-matim gantu a _k_ _kh_ a.\n\nMay Indra come to our prayer!\n\nVII, 31, 10. pra- _k_ etase pra su-matim k _ri_ _n_ udhvam.\n\nMake a prayer for the wise god!\n\nIX, 96, 2. su-matim yati a _k_ _kh_ a.\n\nHe (Soma) goes near to the prayer.\n\nX, 148, 3. rishi _n_ am vipra _h_ su-matim _k_ akana _h_.\n\nThou, the wise, desiring the prayer of the _Ri_ shis.\n\nVIII, 22, 6. ta\xc2\xb4 vam adya sumati-bhi _h_ _s_ ubha _h_ pati (iti) a _s_ vina\npra stuvimahi.\n\nLet us praise to-day the glorious A _s_ vins with our prayers.\n\nIX, 74, 1. tam imahe su-mati\xc2\xb4.\n\nWe implore him with prayer.\n\nIn our passage the verb pipartana, fill or fulfil, indicates in what sense\nsumati ought to be taken. Su-matim pipartana is no more than ka\xc2\xb4mam pipartana,\nfulfil our desire! See VII, 62, 3. a\xc2\xb4 na _h_ ka\xc2\xb4mam pupurantu; I, 158, 2.\nkamapre _n_ a-iva manasa. On sumna, see Burnouf, \xc3\x89tudes, p. 91, and Aufrecht,\nin Kuhn\'s Zeitschrift, vol. iv, p. 274.\n\nNote 3. Krivi _h_ -dati has been a crux to ancient and modern interpreters. It\nis mentioned as a difficult word in the Nigha _n_ _t_ u, and all that Yaska\nhas to say is that it means possessed of cutting teeth (Nir. VI, 30.\nkrivirdati vikartanadanti). Professor Roth, in his note to this passage, says\nthat krivi can never have the meaning of well, which is ascribed to it in the\nNigha _n_ _t_ u III, 23, but seems rather to mean an animal, perhaps the wild\nboar, \xce\xba\xce\xac\xcf\x80\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, with metathesis of v and r. He translates our passage: \'Where\n\np. 222\n\nyour lightning with boar-teeth tears.\' In his Dictionary, however, he only\nsays, \'krivis, perhaps the name of an animal, and dant, tooth.\' Saya _n_ a\ncontents himself with explaining krivirdati by vikshepa _n_ a _s_ iladanti,\nhaving teeth that scatter about.\n\nMy own translation is founded on the supposition that krivis, the first\nportion of krivirdati, has nothing to do with krivi, but is a dialectic\nvariety of kravis, raw flesh, the Greek \xce\xba\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xb1\xcf\x82, Latin caro, cruor. It means\nwhat is raw, bloody, or gory. From it the adjective krura, horrible, cruentus\n(Curtius, Grundzuge, p. 142; Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. ii, p. 235). A name of\nthe goddess Durga in later Sanskrit is kruradanti, and with a similar\nconception the lightning, I believe, is here called krivirdati, with gory\nteeth.\n\nNote 4. It should be observed that in radati the simile of the teeth of the\nlightning is carried on. For radati may be supposed to have had in the Veda,\ntoo, the original meaning of radere and rodere, to scratch, to gnaw. Rada and\nradana in the later Sanskrit mean tooth. It is curious, however, that there is\nno other passage in the Rig-veda where rad clearly means to bite. It means to\ncut, in\n\nI, 61, 12. go _h_ na parva vi rada tira _s_ _k_ a\xc2\xb4.\n\nCut his joint through, as the joint of an ox.\n\nBut in most passages where rad occurs in the Veda, it has the meaning of\ngiving. It is not the same which we have in the Zend rad, to give, and which\nJusti rightly identifies with the root radh. But rad, to divide, may, like the\nGerman theilen in zutheilen, have taken the meaning of giving. Greek \xce\xb4\xce\xb1\xce\xaf\xcf\x89\nmeans to divide, but yields \xce\xb4\xce\xb1\xce\xaf\xcf\x82, portion, meal, just as Sanskrit day, to\ndivide, yields dayas, share, i. e. inheritance.\n\nThis meaning is evident in the following passages:\n\nVII, 79, 4. ta\xc2\xb4vat usha _h_ ra\xc2\xb4dha _h_ asmabhyam rasva ya\xc2\xb4vat stot _r i_-bhya\n_h_ arada _h_ g _ri_ _n_ ana\xc2\xb4.\n\nGrant us, Ushas, so much wealth as thou hast given to the singers, when\npraised.\n\nI, 116, 7. kakshi\xc2\xb4vate aradatam puram-dhim.\n\nYou gave wisdom to Kakshivat.\n\nI, 169, 8. rada marut-bhi _h_ _s_ urudha _h_ go-agra _h_.\n\np. 223\n\nGive to the Maruts gifts, rich in cattle.\n\nVII, 62, 3. vi na _h_ sahasram _s_ urudha _h_ radantu.\n\nMay they (the gods) give to us a thousand gifts!\n\nI, 117, 11. va\xc2\xb4 _g_ am vipraya--radanta.\n\nGiving spoil to the sage!\n\nVI, 61, 6. rada pusha\xc2\xb4-iva na _h_ sanim.\n\nGive us, Sarasvati, wealth, like Pushan!\n\nIX, 93, 4. rada indo (iti) rayim.\n\nGive us, O Indra, wealth!\n\nVII, 32, 18. rada-vaso (iti).\n\nIndra, thou who givest wealth!\n\nIn many passages, however, this verb rad is connected with words meaning way\nor path, and it then becomes a question whether it simply means to grant a\nway, or to cut a way open for some one. In Zend, too, the same idiom occurs,\nand Professor Justi explains it by \'prepare a way.\' I subjoin the principal\npassages:\n\nVI, 30, 3. yat abhya _h_ arada _h_ gatum indra.\n\nThat thou hast cut a way for them (the rivers). Cf. VII, 74, 4.\n\nIV, 19, 2. pra vartani\xc2\xb4 _h_ arada _h_ vi _s_ va-dhena _h_.\n\nThou (Indra) hast cut open the paths for all the cows.\n\nX, 75, 2. pra te aradat varu _n_ a _h_ ya\xc2\xb4tave patha _h_.\n\nVaru _n_ a cut the paths for thee to go.\n\nVII, 87, 1. radat patha _h_ varu _n_ a _h_ su\xc2\xb4ryaya.\n\nVaru _n_ a cut paths for Surya.\n\nV, 80, 3. patha _h_ radanti suvita\xc2\xb4ya devi\xc2\xb4.\n\nShe, the dawn, cutting open the paths for welfare.\n\nVII, 60, 4. yasmai aditya\xc2\xb4 _h_ adhvana _h_ radanti.\n\nFor whom the \xc3\x82dityas cut roads.\n\nII, 30, 2. patha _h_ radanti _h_ --dhunaya _h_ yanti artham.\n\nCutting their paths, the rivers go to their goal.\n\nThis last verse seems to show that the cutting open of a road is really the\nidea expressed by rad in all these passages. And thus we find the rivers\nthemselves saying that Indra cut them out or delivered them:\n\nIII, 33, 6. indra _h_ asma\xc2\xb4n aradat va _g_ ra-bahu _h_. Cf. X, 89, 7.\n\nNote 5. Ri _n_ a\xc2\xb4ti, like the preceding expressions krivirdati and radati, is\nnot chosen at random, for though it has the\n\np. 224\n\ngeneral meaning of crushing or destroying, it is used by the Vedic poets with\nspecial reference to the chewing or crunching by means of the teeth. For\ninstance,\n\nI, 148, 4. puru\xc2\xb4 _n_ i dasma _h_ ni ri _n_ ati _g_ ambhai _h_.\n\nAgni crunches many things with his jaws.\n\nI, 127, 4. sthira\xc2\xb4 _k_ it anna ni ri _n_ ati o _g_ asa.\n\nEven tough morsels he (Agni) crunches fiercely. In a more general sense we\nfind it used,\n\nV, 41, 10. _s_ o _k_ i _h_ -ke _s_ a _h_ ni ri _n_ ati vana.\n\nAgni with flaming hair swallows or destroys the forests.\n\nIV, 19, 3. ahim va _g_ re _n_ a vi ri _n_ a _h_.\n\nThou destroyedst Ahi with the thunderbolt.\n\nX, 120, 1. sadya _h_ _g_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana _h_ ni ri _n_ ati _s_ atrun.\n\nAs soon as born he destroys his enemies.\n\nNote 6. Sudhita-iva barha _n_ a. I think the explanation of this phrase given\nby Saya _n_ a may be retained. He explains sudhita by suhita, i. e. sush _th_\nu prerita, well thrown, well levelled, and barha _n_ a by hatis, tatsadhana\nhetir va, a blow or its instrument, a weapon. Professor Roth takes barha _n_ a\nas an instrumental, used adverbially, in the sense of powerfully, but he does\nnot explain in what sense sudhita-iva ought then to be taken. We cannot well\nrefer it to didyut, lightning, on account of the iva, which requires something\nthat can form a simile of the lightning. Nor is su-dhita ever used as a\nsubstantive so as to take the place of svadhitiva. Su-dhita has apparently\nmany meanings, but they all centre in one common conception. Su-dhita means\nwell placed, of a thing which is at rest, well arranged, well ordered, secure;\nor it means well sent, well thrown, of a thing which has been in motion.\nApplied to human beings, it means well disposed or kind.\n\nIII, 23, 1. ni _h_ -mathita _h_ su-dhita _h_ a\xc2\xb4 sadha-sthe.\n\nAgni produced by rubbing, and well placed in his abode.\n\nVII, 42, 4. su-prita _h_ agni _h_ su-dhita _h_ dame a\xc2\xb4.\n\nAgni, who is cherished and well placed in the house.\n\nIII, 29, 2. ara _n_ yo _h_ ni-hita _h_ gata-veda _h_ garbha _h_ -iva su-dhita\n_h_ garbhi _n_ ishu.\n\nAgni placed in the two fire-sticks, well placed like an embryo in the mothers.\nCf. X, 27, 16.\n\np. 225\n\nVIII, 60, 4. abhi praya _m_ si su-dhita a\xc2\xb4 vaso (iti) gahi.\n\nCome, O Vasu, to these well-placed offerings. Cf. I, 135, 4; VI, 15, 15; X,\n53, 2.\n\nX, 70, 8. su-dhita havi\xc2\xb4 _m_ shi.\n\nThe well-placed offerings.\n\nIV, 2, 10 (adhvaram). VII, 7, 3 (barhi _h_ ).\n\nAs applied to a\xc2\xb4yus, life, sudhita may be translated by well established,\nsafe:\n\nII, 27, 10. a _s_ ya\xc2\xb4ma a\xc2\xb4yu _m_ shi su-dhitani pu\xc2\xb4rva.\n\nMay we obtain the happy long lives of our forefathers.\n\nIV, 50, 8. sa _h_ it ksheti su-dhita _h_ okasi sve.\n\nThat man dwells secure in his own house.\n\nApplied to a missile weapon, sudhita may mean well placed, as it were, well\nshouldered, well held, before it is thrown; or well levelled, well aimed, when\nit is thrown:\n\nI, 167, 3. mimyaksha yeshu su-dhita-- _ri_ sh _t_ i _h_.\n\nTo whom the well held spear sticks fast.\n\nVI, 33, 3. tvam ta\xc2\xb4n indra ubhayan amitran da\xc2\xb4sa v _ri_ tra\xc2\xb4 _n_ i a\xc2\xb4rya _k_ a\n_s_ ura, vadhi _h_ vana-iva su-dhitebhi _h_ atkai _h_.\n\nThou, Indra, O hero, struckest both enemies, the barbarous and the Aryan\nfiends, like forests with well-aimed weapons.\n\nApplied to a poem, sudhita means well arranged or perfect:\n\nI, 140, 11. idam agne su-dhitam du _h_ -dhitat adhi priya\xc2\xb4t u _m_ (iti) _k_ it\nmanmana _h_ preya _h_ astu te.\n\nMay this perfect prayer be more agreeable to thee than an imperfect one,\nthough thou likest it.\n\nVII, 32, 13. mantram akharvam su-dhitam. A poem, not mean, well contrived.\n\nAs applied to men, sudhita means very much the same as hita, well disposed,\nkind:\n\nIV, 6, 7. adha mitra _h_ na su-dhita _h_ pavaka _h_ agni _h_ didaya\nma\xc2\xb4nushishu vikshu.\n\nThen, like a kind friend, Agni shone among the children of man.\n\nV, 3, 2. mitram su-dhitam.\n\nVI, 15, 2. mitram na yam su-dhitam.\n\nVIII, 23, 8. mitram na _g_ ane su-dhitam _ri_ ta-vani.\n\np. 226\n\nX, 115, 7. mitra\xc2\xb4sa _h_ na ye su-dhita _h_.\n\nAt last su-dhita, without reference to human beings, takes the general sense\nof kind, good:\n\nIII, 11, 8. pari vi _s_ vani su-dhita agne _h_ a _s_ yama manma-bhi _h_.\n\nMay we obtain through our prayers all the goods of Agni.\n\nHere, however, praya _m_ si may have to be supplied, and in that case this\npassage, too, should be classed with those mentioned above, VIII, 60, 4, &c.\n\nIf then we consider that sudhita, as applied to weapons, means well held or\nwell aimed, we can hardly doubt that barha _n_ a is here, as Saya _n_ a says,\nsome kind of weapon. I should derive it from barhayati, to crush, which we\nhave, for instance,\n\nI, 133, 5. pi _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85ga-bh _ri_ sh _t_ im ambhri _n_ am pisa\xc2\xb4 _k_ im indra sam\nm _ri_ _n_ a, sarvam raksha _h_ ni barhaya.\n\nPound together the fearful Pi _s_ a _k_ i with his fiery weapons, strike down\nevery Rakshas.\n\nII, 23, 8. b _r i_haspate deva-nida _h_ ni barhaya.\n\nB _ri_ haspati strike down the scoffers of the gods. Cf. VI, 61, 3.\n\nBarha _n_ a would therefore mean a weapon intended to crush an enemy, a block\nof stone, it may be, or a heavy club, and in that sense barha _n_ a occurs at\nleast once more:\n\nVIII, 63, 7. yat pa\xc2\xb4 _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a- _g_ anyaya vi _s_ a\xc2\xb4 indre ghosha _h_ as _ri_\nkshata, ast _ri_ _n_ at barha _n_ a vipa _h_.\n\nWhen shouts have been sent up to Indra by the people of the five clans, then\nthe club scattered the spears; or, then he scattered the spears with his club.\n\nIn other passages Professor Roth is no doubt right when he assigns to barha\n_n_ a an adverbial meaning, but I do not think that this meaning would be\nappropriate in our verse. Grassmann also translates, \'ein wohlgezielter\nPfeil.\'\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Alat _ri_ _n_ a\xc2\xb4sa _h_ , a word which occurs but once more, and which\nhad evidently become unintelligible even at the\n\np. 227\n\ntime of Yaska. He (Nir. VI, 2) explains it by alamatardano megha _h_ , the\ncloud which opens easily. This, at least, is the translation given by\nProfessor Roth, though not without hesitation. Alamatardana _h_ , as a\ncompound, is explained by the commentator as atardanaparyapta _h_ , alam\natardayitum udakam, i. e. capable of letting off the water. But Devara _g_ aya\n_g_ van explains it differently. He says: alam paryaptam atardanam hi _m_ sa\nyasya, bahudakatva _k_ _kh_ abalo megho vi _s_ eshyate, i. e. whose injuring\nis great; the dark cloud is so called because it contains much water. Saya _n_\na. too, attempts several explanations. In III, 30, 10, he seems to derive it\nfrom t _ri_ h, to kill, not, like Yaska, from t _ri_ d, and he explains its\nmeaning as the cloud which is exceedingly hurt by reason of its holding so\nmuch water. In our passage he explains it either as anat _ri_ _n_ a, free from\ninjury, or good hurters of enemies, or good givers of rewards.\n\nFrom all this I am afraid we gain nothing. Let us now see what modern\ncommentators have proposed in order to discover an appropriate meaning in this\nword. Professor Roth suggests that the word may be derived from ra, to give,\nand the suffix t _ri_ _n_ a, and the negative particle, thus meaning, one who\ndoes not give or yield anything. But, if so, how is this adjective applicable\nto the Maruts, who in this very verse are praised for their generosity?\nLanglois in our passage translates, \'heureux de nos louanges;\' in III, 30, 10,\nqui laissait fletrir les plantes.\' Wilson in our passage translates, \'devoid\nof malevolence;\' but in III, 30, 10, \'heavy.\'\n\nI do not pretend to solve all these difficulties, but I may say this in\ndefence of my own explanation that it fulfils the condition of being\napplicable both to the Maruts and to the demon Bala. The suffix t _ri_ _n_ a\nis certainly irregular, and I should much prefer to write alat _ri_ _n_ a, for\nin that case we might derive latrin from latra, and to this latra, i. e.\nratra, I. should ascribe the sense of barking. The root rai or ra means to\nbark, and has been connected by Professor Aufrecht with Latin rire, inrire,\nand possibly inritare a,\n\np. 228\n\nthus showing a transition of meaning from barking, to provoking or attacking.\nThe same root ra explains also the Latin latrare, to bark, allatrare, to\nassail; and, whatever ancient etymologists may say to the contrary, the Latin\nlatro, an assailer. The old derivation \'latrones eos antiqui dicebant, qui\nconducti militabant, \xe1\xbc\x80\xcf\x80\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xcf\x84\xe1\xbf\x86\xcf\x82 \xce\xbb\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xcf\x81\xce\xb5\xce\xaf\xce\xb1\xcf\x82,\' seems to me one of those etymologies\nin which the scholars of Rome, who had learnt a little Greek, delighted as\nmuch as scholars who know a little Sanskrit delight in finding some plausible\nderivation for any Greek or Latin word in Sanskrit. I know that Curtius\n(Grundzuge, p. 326) and Corssen (Kritische Nachtrage, p. 239) take a different\nview; but a foreign word, derived from \xce\xbb\xce\xac\xcf\x84\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xce\xbd, pay, hire, would never have\nproved so fertile as latro has been in Latin.\n\nIf then we could write alatri _n_ a\xc2\xb4sa _h_ , we should have an appropriate\nepithet of the Maruts, in the sense of not assailing or not reviling, in fact,\nfree from malevolence, as Wilson translated the word, or rather Saya _n_ a\'s\nexplanation of it, atardanarahita. What gives me some confidence in this\nexplanation is this, that it is equally applicable to the other passage where\nalat _ri_ _n_ a occurs, III, 30, 10:\n\nalat _ri_ _n_ a _h_ vala _h_ indra vra _g_ a _h_ go _h_ pura\xc2\xb4 hanto _h_\nbhayamana _h_ vi ara.\n\nWithout barking did Vala, the keeper of the cow, full of tear, open, before\nthou struckest him.\n\nIf it should be objected that vra _g_ a means always stable, and is not used\nagain in the sense of keeper, one might reply that vra _g_ a _h_ , in the nom.\nsing., occurs in this one single passage only, and that bhayamana _h_ ,\nfearing, clearly implies a personification. Otherwise, one might translate:\n\'Vala was quiet, O Indra, and the stable of the cow came open, full of fear,\nbefore thou struckest.\' The meaning of alat _ri_ _n_ a would remain the same,\nthe not-barking being here used as a sign that Indra\'s enemy was cowed, and no\nlonger inclined to revile or defy the power of Indra.

It\noccurs but once, but abhi-hrut, a feminine substantive with the same meaning,\noccurs several times. The verb hru, which is not mentioned in the Dhatupa _th_\na, but has been identified with hvar, occurs in our hymn, verse 12:\n\nI, 128, 5. sa _h_ na _h_ trasate du _h_ -ita\xc2\xb4t abhi-hruta _h_ _s_ a _m_ sat\nagha\xc2\xb4t abhi-hruta _h_.\n\nHe protects us from evil, from assault, from evil speaking, from assault.\n\nX, 63, 11. tra\xc2\xb4yadhvam na _h_ du _h_ -evaya _h_ abhi-hruta _h_.\n\nProtect us from mischievous injury!\n\nI, 189, 6. abhi-hrutam asi hi deva vishpa _t_.\n\nFor thou, god, art the deliverer from all assaults. Vishpa _t_ , deliverer,\nfrom vi and spa _s_ , to bind.\n\nVi-hruta, which occurs twice, means evidently what has been injured or\nspoiled:\n\nVIII, 1, 12. ishkarta vi-hrutam punar (iti).\n\nHe who sets right what has been injured. Cf.

Tavisha certainly means strength, and that it is used in the plural in\nthe sense of acts of strength, we can see from the first verse of our hymn and\nother passages. But when we read that tavisha\xc2\xb4 _n_ i are placed on the\nchariots of the Maruts, just as before bhadra\xc2\xb4, good things, food, &c., are\nmentioned, it is clear that so abstract a meaning as strength or powers would\nnot be applicable here. We might take it in the modern sense of forces, i. e.\nyour armies, your companions are on your chariots, striving with each other;\nbut as the word is a neuter, weapons, as the means\n\np. 230\n\nof strength, seemed a preferable rendering. As to mithasp _ri_ dhya, see I,\n119, 3, [p. 164](sbe3224.htm#page_164).\n\nNote 2. The rendering of this passage must depend on the question whether the\nkhadis, whatever they are, can be carried on the shoulders or not. We saw\nbefore ([p. 120](sbe3221.htm#page_120)) that khadis were used both as\nornaments and as weapons, and that, when used as weapons, they were most\nlikely rings or quoits with sharp edges. There is at least one other passage\nwhere these khadis are said to be worn on the shoulders:\n\nVII, 56, 13. a _m_ seshu a\xc2\xb4 maruta _h_ khadaya _h_ va _h_ vaksha _h_ -su\nrukma\xc2\xb4 _h_ upa- _s_ i _s_ riya _n_ a\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nOn your shoulders are the quoits, on your chests the golden chains are\nfastened.\n\nIn other places the khadis are said to be in the hands, hasteshu, but this\nwould only show that they are there when actually used for fighting. Thus we\nread:\n\nI, 168, 3. a\xc2\xb4 esham a _m_ seshu rambhini-iva rarabhe, hasteshu khadi _h_ _k_ a\nk _ri_ ti _h_ _k_ a sam dadhe.\n\nTo their shoulders there clings as if a clinging wife, in their hands the\nquoit is held and the dagger.\n\nIn V, 58, 2, the Maruts are called kha\xc2\xb4di-hasta, holding the quoits in their\nhands. There is one passage which was mentioned before ([p.\n112](sbe3221.htm#page_112)), where the khadis are said to be on the feet of\nthe Maruts, and on the strength of this passage Professor Roth proposes to\nalter pra-patheshu to pra-padeshu, and to translate, \'The khadis are on your\nforefeet.\' I do not think this emendation necessary. Though we do not know the\nexact shape and character of the khadi, we know that it was a weapon, most\nlikely a ring, occasionally used for ornament, and carried along either on the\nfeet or on the shoulders, but in actual battle held in the hand. The weapon\nwhich Vish _n_ u holds in one of his right hands, the so-called _k_ akra, may\nbe the modern representation of the ancient khadi. What, however, is quite\ncertain is this, that khadi in the Veda never means food, as Saya _n_ a\noptionally interprets it. This interpretation is accepted by Wilson, who\ntranslates, \'At your resting-places on the road refreshments (are ready).\'\nNay, he\n\np. 231\n\ngoes on in a note to use this passage as a proof of the advanced civilisation\nof India at the time of the Vedic _Ri_ shis. \'The expression,\' he says, \'is\nworthy of note, as indicating the existence of accommodations for the use of\ntravellers: the prapatha is the choltri of the south of India, the sarai of\nthe Mohammedans, a place by the road-side where the travellers may find\nshelter and provisions.\'\n\nNote 3. This last passage shows that the poet is really representing to\nhimself the Maruts as on their journey, and he therefore adds, \'your axle\nturns the two (IV, 30, 2) wheels together,\' which probably means no more than,\n\'your chariot is going smoothly or quickly.\' Though the expression seems to us\nhardly correct, yet one can well imagine how the axle was supposed to turn the\nwheels as the horses were drawing the axle, and the axle acted on the wheels.\nAnyhow, no other translation seems possible. Samaya in the Veda means\ntogether, at once, and is the Greek (\xe1\xbd\x81\xce\xbc\xe1\xbf\x87, generally \xe1\xbd\x81\xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6 or \xe1\xbd\x81\xce\xbc\xe1\xbf\xb6\xcf\x82, the Latin\nsimul. Cf. I, 56, 6; 73, 6; 113, 10; 163, 3; VII, 66, 15; IX, 75, 4; 85, 5;\n97, 56.\n\nV _ri_ t means to turn, and is frequently used with reference to the wheels:\n\nVIII, 46, 23. da _s_ a _s_ yava\xc2\xb4 _h_ --nemim ni vav _ri_ tu _h_.\n\nThe ten black horses turn down the felly or the wheel.\n\nIV, 30, 2. satra\xc2\xb4 te anu k _ri_ sh _t_ aya _h_ vi _s_ va _h_ _k_ akra\xc2\xb4-iva vav\n_ri_ tu _h_.\n\nAll men turn always round thee, like wheels.\n\nThat the \xc3\x82tmanepada of v _ri_ t may be used in an active sense we see from\n\nI, 191, 15. tata _h_ visham pra vav _ri_ te.\n\nI turn the poison out from here.\n\nAll the words used in this sentence are very old words, and we can with few\nexceptions turn them into Greek or Latin.

See I, 64, 4, note 1, page [111](sbe3221.htm#page_111).\n\nNote 2. See I, 166, 1, note 1, page 212.\n\np. 232\n\nNote 3. On eta in the sense of fallow deer, or, it may be, antelope, see I,\n165, 5, note 2, page [196](sbe3226.htm#page_196).\n\n\xc3\x89ta originally means variegated, and thus becomes a name of any speckled deer,\nit being difficult to say what exact species is meant. Saya _n_ a in our\npassage explains eta _h_ by _s_ uklavar _n_ a mala _h_ , many-coloured wreaths\nor chains, which may be right. Yet the suggestion of Professor Roth that eta\n_h_ , deer, stands here for the skins of fallow deer, is certainly more\npoetical, and quite in accordance with the Vedic idiom, which uses, for\ninstance, go, cow, not only in the sense of milk,--that is done even in more\nhomely English,--but also for leather, and thong. It is likewise in accordance\nwith what we know of the earliest dress of the Vedic Indians, that deer-skins\nshould here be mentioned. We learn from \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana\'s G _ri_ hya-sutras, of\nwhich we now possess an excellent edition by Professor Stenzler, and a reprint\nof the text and commentary by Rama Naraya _n_ a Vidyaratna, in the Bibliotheca\nIndica, that a boy when he was brought to his tutor, i. e. from the eighth to\npossibly the twenty-fourth year, had to be well combed, and attired in a new\ndress. A Brahma _n_ a should wear the skin of an antelope (ai _n_ eya), the\nKshatriya the skin of a deer (raurava), the Vai _s_ ya the skin of a goat (a\n_g_ a). If they wore dresses, that of the Brahma _n_ a should be dark red\n(kashaya), that of the Kshatriya bright red (ma _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ ish _th_ a), that of\nthe Vai _s_ ya yellow (haridra). The girdle of the Brahma _n_ a should be of\nMu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass, that of the Kshatriya a bow-string, that of the Vai _s_ ya\nmade of sheep\'s wool. The same regulations occur in other Sutras, as, for\ninstance, the Dharma-sutras of the \xc3\x82pastambiyas and Gautamas, though there are\ncertain characteristic differences in each, which may be due either to local\nor to chronological causes. Thus according to the \xc3\x82pastambiya-sutras, which\nhave been published by Professor Buhler, the Brahma _n_ a may wear the skin of\nthe hari _n_ a deer, or that of the antelope (ai _n_ eyam), but the latter\nmust be from the black antelope (k _ri_ sh _n_ am), and, a proviso is added,\nthat if a man wears the black antelope skin, he must never spread it out to\nsit or sleep on it. As materials for the dress, \xc3\x82pastamba\n\np. 233\n\nallows _s_ a _n_ a, hemp a, or kshuma, flax, and he adds that woollen dresses\nare allowed to all castes, as well as the kambala (masc.), which seems to be\nany cloth made of vegetable substances (darbhadinirmitam _k_ iram kambalam).\nHe then adds a curious remark, which would seem to show\n\np. 234\n\nthat the Brahma _n_ as preferred skins, and the Kshatriyas clothes, for he\nsays that those who wish well to the Brahma _n_ as should wear a _g_ ina,\nskins, and those who wish well to the Kshatriyas should wear vastra, clothes,\nand those who wish well to both should wear both, but, in that case, the skin\nshould always form the outer garment. The Dharma-sutras of the Gautamas, which\nwere published in India, prescribe likewise for the Brahma _n_ a the black\nantelope skin, and allow clothes of hemp or linen ( _s_ a _n_ akshauma _k_\nira) as well as kutapas (woollen cloth) for all. What is new among the\nGautamas is, that they add the karpasa, the cotton dress, which is important\nas showing an early knowledge of this manufacture. The karpasa dress occurs\nonce more as a present to be given to the Potar priest (\xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ rauta-\nsutras IX, 4), and was evidently considered as a valuable present, taking\nprecedence of the kshaumi or linen dress. It is provided that the cotton dress\nshould not be dyed, for this, I suppose, is the meaning of avik _ri_ ta.\nImmediately after, however, it is said, that some authorities say the dress\nshould be dyed red (kashayam apy eke), the very expression which occurred in\n\xc3\x82pastamba, and that, in that case, the red for the Brahma _n_ a\'s dress should\nbe taken from the bark of trees (varksha). Manu, who here, as elsewhere,\nsimply paraphrases the ancient Sutras, says, II, 41:\n\nkarsh _n_ arauravabastani _k_ arma _n_ i brahma _k_ ari _n_ a _h_  \nvasirann anupurvye _n_ a _s_ a _n_ akshaumavikani _k_ a.\n\n\'Let Brahma _k_ arins wear (as outer garments) the skins of the black\nantelope, the deer, the goat, (as under garments) dresses of hemp, flax, and\nsheep\'s wool, in the order of the three castes.\'\n\nThe Sanskrit name for a dressed skin is a _g_ ina, a word which does not occur\nin the Rig-Veda, but which, if Bopp is right in deriving it from a _g_ a,\ngoat, as \xce\xb1\xe1\xbc\xb0\xce\xb3\xce\xaf\xcf\x82 from \xce\xb1\xe1\xbc\xb4\xce\xbe, would have meant originally, not skin in general, but\na goat-skin. The skins of the eta, here ascribed to the Maruts, would be\nidentical with the ai _n_ eya, which \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana ascribes to the Brahma _n_\na, not, as we should expect, to the Kshatriya, if, as has been supposed, ai\n_n_ eya is derived from ena, which is a secondary form, particularly in the\n\np. 235\n\nfeminine eni, of eta. There is, however, another word, e _d_ a, a kind of\nsheep, which, but for Festus, might be haedus, and by its side e _n_ a, a kind\nof antelope. These two forms pre-suppose an earlier er _n_ a or ar _n_ a, and\npoint therefore in a different direction, though hardly to \xe1\xbc\x84\xcf\x81\xce\xbd\xce\xb5\xcf\x82.\n\nNote 4. I translate kshura by sharp edges, but it might have been translated\nliterally by razors, for, strange as it may sound, razors were known, not only\nduring the Vedic period, but even previous to the Aryan separation. The\nSanskrit kshura is the Greek \xce\xbe\xcf\x85\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82 or \xce\xbe\xcf\x85\xcf\x81\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xbd. In the Veda we have clear\nallusions to shaving:\n\nX, 142, 4. yada\xc2\xb4 te va\xc2\xb4ta _h_ anu-va\xc2\xb4ti _s_ o _k_ i _h_ , vapta-iva _s_ ma _s_\nru vapasi pra bhu\xc2\xb4ma.\n\nWhen the wind blows after thy blast, then thou shavest the earth as a barber\nshaves the beard. Cf. I, 65, 4.\n\nIf, as B. and R. suggest, vaptar, barber, is connected with the more modern\nname for barber in Sanskrit, viz. napita. we should have to admit a root svap,\nin the sense of tearing or pulling, vellere, from which we might derive the\nVedic svapu\xc2\xb4 (VII, 56, 3), beak. Corresponding to this we find in Old High-\nGerman snabul, beak, (schnepfe, snipe,) and in Old Norse nef. The Anglo-Saxon\nneb means mouth and nose, while in modern English neb or nib is used for the\nbill or beak of a bird a. Another derivation of napita, proposed by Professor\nWeber (Kuhn\'s Beitrage, vol. i, p. 505), who takes napita as a dialectic form\nof snapitar, balneator, or lavator, might be admitted if it could be proved\nthat in India also the barber was at the same time a balneator. Burnouf,\nLotus, p. 452, translating from the Sama _\xc3\xb1_ _\xc3\xb1_ a-phala Sutta, mentions among\nthe different professions of the people those of \'portier,\' \'barbier,\' and\n\'baigneur.\'\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. Vi-bhutaya _h_ is properly a substantive, meaning\n\np. 236\n\npower, but, like other substantives a, and particularly substantives with\nprepositions, it can be used as an adjective, and is, in fact, more frequently\nused as an adjective than as a substantive. In English we may translate it by\npower. It is a substantive,\n\nI, 8, 9. eva hi te vi-bhutaya _h_ utaya _h_ indra ma\xc2\xb4-vate sadya _h_ _k_ it\nsanti da _s_ ushe.\n\nFor indeed thy powers, O Indra, are at once shelters for a sacrificer, like\nme.\n\nBut it is an adjective,\n\nI, 30, 5. vi-bhuti _h_ astu sun _r i_ta.\n\nMay the prayer be powerful.\n\nVI, 17, 4. maha\xc2\xb4m anunam tavasam vi-bhutim matsara\xc2\xb4sa _h_ _g_ arh _ri_ shanta\npra-saham.\n\nThe sweet draughts of Soma delighted the great, the perfect, the strong, the\npowerful, the unyielding Indra. Cf. VIII, 49, 6; 50, 6.\n\nVibhva\xcc\x83 _h_ , with the Svarita on the last syllable, has to be pronounced\nvibhua _h_. In III, 6, 9, we find vi-bhava _h_.\n\nNote 2. See I, 87, 1, note 1, page [160](sbe3224.htm#page_160).\n\nNote 3. See I, 6, 5, note 1, page [41](sbe3216.htm#page_41).\n\n##### Verse 12.\n\nNote 1. Mahi-tvanam, greatness, is formed by the suffix tvana, which Professor\nAufrecht has identified with the Greek \xcf\x83\xe1\xbd\xbb\xce\xbd\xce\xb7 (\xcf\x83\xcf\x85\xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbd); see Kuhn\'s Zeitschrift,\nvol. i, p. 482. The origin of this suffix has been explained by Professor\nBenfey, ibid. vol. vii, p. 120, who traces it back to the suffix tvan, for\ninstance, i-tvan, goer, in prata _h_ -itva = prata _h_ -ya\xc2\xb4va.\n\nNote 2. Vrata is one of the many words which, though we may perceive their one\ncentral idea, and their original purport, we have to translate by various\nterms in order to make them intelligible in every passage where they occur.\nVrata (from v _ri_ , v _ri_ _n_ oti), I believe, meant originally what is\nenclosed, protected, set apart, the Greek \xce\xbd\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82:\n\n1\\. V, 46, 7. ya\xc2\xb4 _h_ pa\xc2\xb4rthivasa _h_ ya\xc2\xb4 _h_ apa\xc2\xb4m api vrate ta\xc2\xb4 _h_ na _h_\ndevi _h_ su-hava _h_ _s_ arma ya _k_ _kh_ ata.\n\np. 237\n\nO ye gracious goddesses, who are on the earth or in the realm of the waters,\ngrant us your protection!\n\nHere vrata is used like v _ri_ _g_ ana, see I, 165, 15, note 3, page\n[208](sbe3226.htm#page_208).\n\nX, 114, 2. ta\xc2\xb4sam ni _k_ ikyu _h_ kavaya _h_ ni-da\xc2\xb4nam pareshu ya\xc2\xb4 _h_\nguhyeshu vrateshu.\n\nThe poets discovered their (the Nir _ri_ tis\') origin, who are in the far\nhidden chambers.\n\nI, 163, 3. asi trita _h_ guhyena vratena.\n\nThou art Trita within the hidden place, or with the secret work.\n\nDr. Muir sent me another passage:\n\nIII, 54, 5. dad _ri_ _s_ re esham avama\xc2\xb4 sada _m_ si pareshu ya\xc2\xb4 guhyeshu\nvrateshu.\n\n2\\. Vrata means what is fenced off or forbidden, what is determined, what is\nsettled, and hence, like dharman, law, ordinance. Varayati means to prohibit.\nIn this sense vrata occurs very frequently:\n\nI, 25, 1. yat _k_ it hi te vi _s_ a _h_ yatha pra deva varu _n_ a vratam,\nminimasi dyavi-dyavi.\n\nWhatever law of thine we break, O Varu _n_ a, day by day, men as we are.\n\nII, 8, 3. yasya vratam ni mi\xc2\xb4yate.\n\nWhose law is not broken.\n\nIII, 32, 8. indrasya karma su-k _ri_ ta puru\xc2\xb4 _n_ i vrata\xc2\xb4ni deva\xc2\xb4 _h_ na\nminanti vi _s_ ve.\n\nThe deeds of Indra are well done and many, all the gods do not break his laws,\nor do not injure his ordinances.\n\nII, 24, 12. vi _s_ vam satyam maghavana yuvo _h_ it a\xc2\xb4pa _h_ _k_ ana pra\nminanti vratam vam.\n\nAll that is yours, O powerful gods, is true; even the waters do not break your\nlaw.\n\nII, 38, 7. naki _h_ asya ta\xc2\xb4ni vrata\xc2\xb4 devasya savitu _h_ minanti.\n\nNo one breaks these laws of this god Savitar.

The laws or ordinances or institutions of the gods are sometimes taken for\nthe sacrifices which are supposed to be enjoined by the gods, and the\nperformance of which is, in a certain sense, the performance of the divine\nwill.\n\nI, 93, 8. ya _h_ agni\xc2\xb4shoma havisha saparya\xc2\xb4t devadri\xc2\xb4 _k_ a manasa ya _h_ gh\n_ri_ tena, tasya vratam rakshatam patam a _m_ hasa _h_.\n\nHe who worships Agni and Soma with oblations, with a godly mind, or with an\noffering, protect his sacrifice, shield him from evil!\n\nI, 31, 2. tvam agne prathama _h_ a\xe1\xb9\x85gira _h_ -tama _h_ kavi _h_ deva\xc2\xb4nam pari\nbhushasi vratam.\n\np. 239\n\nAgni, the first and wisest of poets, thou performest the sacrifice of the\ngods.\n\nIII, 3, 9. tasya vrata\xc2\xb4ni bhuri-poshi _n_ a _h_ vayam upa bhushema dame a\xc2\xb4 suv\n_ri_ kti-bhi _h_.\n\nLet us, who possess much wealth, perform with prayers the sacrifices of Agni\nwithin our house.\n\nIn another acceptation the vratas of the gods are what they perform and\nestablish themselves, their own deeds:\n\nIII, 6, 5. vrata\xc2\xb4 te agne mahata _h_ maha\xc2\xb4ni tava kratva rodasi (iti) a\xc2\xb4\ntatantha.\n\nThe deeds of thee, the great Agni, are great, by thy power thou hast stretched\nout heaven and earth.\n\nVIII, 42, 1. astabhnat dya\xc2\xb4m asura _h_ vi _s_ va-veda _h_ amimita varima\xc2\xb4 _n_\nam p _ri_ thivya\xc2\xb4 _h_ , a asidat vi _s_ va bhuvanani sam-ra\xc2\xb4 _t_ vi _s_ va it\nta\xc2\xb4ni varu _n_ asya vrata\xc2\xb4ni.\n\nThe wise spirit established the sky, and made the width of the earth, as king\nhe approached all beings,--all these are the works of Varu _n_ a.\n\nVI, 14, 3. tu\xc2\xb4rvanta _h_ dasyum ayava _h_ vratai _h_ si\xc2\xb4kshanta _h_ avratam.\n\nMen fight the fiend, trying to overcome by their deeds him who performs no\nsacrifices; or, the lawless enemy.\n\nLastly, vrata comes to mean sway, power, or work, and the expression vrate\ntava signifies, at thy command, under thy auspices:\n\nI, 24, 15. atha vayam aditya vrate tava anagasa _h_ aditaye syama.\n\nThen, O \xc3\x82ditya, under thy auspices may we be guiltless before Aditi.\n\nVI, 54, 9. pu\xc2\xb4shan tava vrate vayam ni rishyema kada _k_ ana.\n\nO Pushan, may we never fail under thy protection.\n\nX, 36, 13. ye savitu _h_ satya-savasya vi _s_ ve mitrasya vrate varu _n_ asya\ndeva\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nAll the gods who are in the power of Savitar, Mitra, and Varu _n_ a.\n\nV, 83, 5. yasya vrate p _ri_ thivi\xc2\xb4 namnamiti yasya vrate _s_ apha-vat _g_\narbhuriti, yasya vrate oshadhi _h_ vi _s_ va-rupa _h_ sa _h_ na _h_ par _g_\nanya mahi _s_ arma ya _k_ _kh_ a.\n\np. 240\n\nAt whose bidding the earth bows down, at whose bidding hoofed animals run\nabout, at whose bidding the plants assume all shapes, mayest thou, O Par _g_\nanya, yield us great protection!\n\nNote 3.

Cf. IV,\n38, 1.\n\nProfessor Roth considers that datra is derived rather from da, to divide, and\nthat it means share, lot, possession. But there is not a single passage where\nthe meaning of gift or\n\np. 241\n\nbounty does not answer all purposes. In VII, 56, 21, ma\xc2\xb4 va _h_ datra\xc2\xb4t maruta\n_h_ ni _h_ arama, is surely best translated by, \'let us not fall away from\nyour bounty,\' and in our own passage the same meaning should be assigned to\ndatra. The idea of datra, bounty, is by no means incompatible with vrata,\nrealm, dominion, sway, if we consider that the sphere within which the bounty\nof a king or a god is exercised and accepted, is in one sense his realm. What\nthe poet therefore says in our passage is simply this, that the bounty of the\nMaruts extends as far as the realm of Aditi, i. e. is endless, or extends\neverywhere, Aditi being in its original conception the deity of the unbounded\nworld beyond, the earliest attempt at expressing the Infinite.\n\nAs to da\xc2\xb4tra occurring once with the accent on the first syllable in the sense\nof sickle, see M. M., \'\xc3\x9cber eine Stelle in Yaska\'s Commentar zum Naigha _n_\n_t_ uka,\' Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, 1853, vol.\nvii, P. 375.\n\nVIII, 78, 10. tava it indra aham a- _s_ asa haste da\xc2\xb4tram _k_ ana a\xc2\xb4 dade.\n\nTrusting in thee alone, O Indra, I take the sickle in my hand.\n\nThis da\xc2\xb4tra, sickle, is derived from do, to cut.\n\nAditi, the Infinite.\n\nNote 4. Aditi, an ancient god or goddess, is in reality the earliest name\ninvented to express the Infinite; not the Infinite as the result of a long\nprocess of abstract reasoning, but the visible Infinite, visible, as it were,\nto the naked eye, the endless expanse beyond the earth, beyond the clouds,\nbeyond the sky. That was called A-diti, the un-bound, the un-bounded; one\nmight almost say, but for fear of misunderstandings, the Absolute, for it is\nderived from diti, bond, and the negative particle, and meant therefore\noriginally what is free from bonds of any kind, whether of space or time, free\nfrom physical weakness, free from moral guilt. Such a conception became of\nnecessity a being, a person, a god. To us such a name and such a conception\nseem decidedly modern, and to find in the Veda Aditi, the\n\np. 242\n\n[paragraph continues] Infinite, as the mother of the principal gods, is\ncertainly, at first sight, startling. But the fact is that the thoughts of\nprimitive humanity were not only different from our thoughts, but different\nalso from what we think their thoughts ought to have been. The poets of the\nVeda indulged freely in theogonic speculations, without being frightened by\nany contradictions. They knew of Indra as the greatest of gods, they knew of\nAgni as the god of gods, they knew of Varu _n_ a as the ruler of all, but they\nwere by no means startled at the idea that their Indra had a mother, or that\ntheir Agni was born like a babe from the friction of two fire-sticks, or that\nVaru _n_ a and his brother Mitra were nursed in the lap of Aditi. Some poet\nwould take hold o the idea of an unbounded power, of Aditi, originally without\nany reference to other gods. Very soon these ideas met, and, without any\nmisgivings, either the gods were made subordinate to, and represented as the\nsons of Aditi, or where Indra was to be praised as supreme, Aditi was\nrepresented as doing him homage.\n\nVIII, 12, 14. uta sva-ra _g_ e aditi _h_ stomam indraya _g_ i _g_ anat.\n\nAnd Aditi produced a hymn for Indra, the king.\n\nHere Professor Roth takes Aditi as an epithet of Agni, not as the name of the\ngoddess Aditi, while Dr. Muir rightly takes it in the latter sense, and\nlikewise retains stomam instead of somam, as printed by Professor Aufrecht.\nCf. VII, 38, 4.\n\nThe idea of the Infinite, as I have tried to show elsewhere, was most\npowerfully impressed on the awakening mind, or, as we now say, was revealed,\nby the East a. \'It is impossible to enter fully into all the thoughts and\nfeelings that passed through the minds of the early poets when they formed\nnames for that far, far East from whence even the early dawn, the sun, the\nday, their own life, seemed to spring. A new life flashed up every morning\nbefore their eyes, and the fresh breezes of the dawn reached them like\ngreetings from the distant lands beyond the mountains, beyond the clouds,\nbeyond the dawn, beyond "the immortal\n\np. 243\n\nsea which brought us hither." The dawn seemed to them to open golden gates for\nthe sun to pass in triumph, and while those gates were open, their eyes and\ntheir mind strove in their childish way to pierce beyond the limits of this\nfinite world. That silent aspect awakened in the human mind the conception of\nthe Infinite, the Immortal, the Divine.\' Aditi is a name for that distant\nEast, but Aditi is more than the dawn. Aditi is beyond the dawn, and in one\nplace (I, 113, 19) the dawn is called \'the face of Aditi,\' aditer anikam. Thus\nwe read:\n\nV, 62, 8. hira _n_ ya-rupam ushasa _h_ vi-ush _t_ au aya _h_ -sthu _n_ am ut-\nita su\xc2\xb4ryasya, a\xc2\xb4 rohatha _h_ varu _n_ a mitra gartam ata _h_ _k_ akshathe\n(iti) aditim ditim h.\n\nMitra and Varu _n_ a, you mount your chariot, which is golden, when the dawn\nbursts forth, and has iron poles at the setting of the sun: from thence you\nsee Aditi and Diti, i. e. what is yonder and what is here.\n\nIf we keep this original conception of Aditi clearly before our mind, the\nvarious forms which Aditi assumes, even in the hymns of the Veda, will not\nseem incoherent. Aditi is not a prominent deity in the Veda, she is celebrated\nrather in her sons, the \xc3\x82dityas, than in her own person. While there are so\nmany hymns addressed to Ushas, the dawn, or Indra, or Agni, or Savitar, there\nis but one hymn, X, 72, which from our point of view, though not from that of\nIndian theologians, might be called a hymn to Aditi. Nevertheless Aditi is a\nfamiliar name; a name of the past, whether in time or in thought only, and a\nname that lives on in the name of the \xc3\x82dityas, the sons of Aditi, including\nthe principal deities of the Veda.\n\nAditi and the \xc3\x82dityas.\n\nThus we read:\n\nI, 107, 2. upa na _h_ deva\xc2\xb4 _h_ avasa a\xc2\xb4 gamantu a\xe1\xb9\x85girasam sa\xc2\xb4ma-bhi _h_\nstuyamana _h_ , indra _h_ indriyai _h_ maruta _h_ marut-bhi _h_ adityai _h_ na\n_h_ aditi _h_ _s_ arma ya _m_ sat.\n\nMay the gods come to us with their help, praised by the songs of the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras,\n--Indra with his powers, the Maruts with the storms, may Aditi with the\n\xc3\x82dityas give us protection!\n\np. 244\n\nX, 66, 3. indra _h_ vasu-bhi _h_ pari patu na _h_ gayam adityai _h_ na _h_\naditi _h_ _s_ arma ya _k_ _kh_ atu, rudra _h_ rudrebhi _h_ deva _h_ m _ri_ _l_\nayati na _h_ tvash _t_ a na _h_ gna\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ suvita\xc2\xb4ya _g_ invatu.\n\nMay Indra with the Vasus watch our house, may Aditi with the \xc3\x82dityas give us\nprotection, may the divine Rudra with the Rudras have mercy upon us, may Tvash\n_t_ ar with the mothers bring us to happiness!\n\nIII, 54, 20. adityai _h_ nah aditi _h_ _s_ _ri_ _n_ otu ya _k_ _kh_ antu na\n_h_ maruta _h_ _s_ arma bhadram.\n\nMay Aditi with the \xc3\x82dityas hear us, may the Maruts give us good protection!\n\nIn another passage Varu _n_ a takes the place of Aditi as the leader of the\n\xc3\x82dityas:\n\nVII, 35, 6. _s_ am na _h_ indra _h_ vasu-bhi _h_ deva _h_ astu _s_ am\nadityebhi _h_ varu _n_ a _h_ su- _s_ a _m_ sa _h_ , _s_ am na _h_ rudra _h_\nrudrebhi _h_ _g_ alasha _h_ _s_ am na _h_ tvash _t_ a gna\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ iha _s_ _ri_\n_n_ otu.\n\nMay Indra bless us, the god with the Vasus! May Varu _n_ a, the glorious,\nbless us with the \xc3\x82dityas! May the relieving Rudra with the Rudras bless us!\nMay Tvash _t_ ar with the mothers kindly hear us here!\n\nEven in passages where the poet seems to profess an exclusive worship of\nAditi, as in\n\nV, 69, 3. prata _h_ devi\xc2\xb4m aditim _g_ ohavimi madhyandine ut-ita su\xc2\xb4ryasya,\n\nI invoke the divine Aditi early in the morning, at noon, and at the setting of\nthe sun,\n\nMitra and Varu _n_ a, her principal sons, are mentioned immediately after, and\nimplored, like her, to bestow blessings on their worshipper.\n\nHer exclusive worship appears once, in VIII, 19, 14.\n\nA very frequent expression is that of aditya\xc2\xb4 _h_ aditi _h_ without any\ncopula, to signify the \xc3\x82dityas and Aditi:\n\nIV, 25, 3. ka _h_ deva\xc2\xb4nam ava _h_ adya v _ri_ _n_ ite ka _h_ aditya\xc2\xb4n aditim\n_g_ yoti _h_ i _t_ _t_ e.\n\nWho does choose now the protection of the gods? Who asks the \xc3\x82dityas, Aditi,\nfor their light?\n\nVI, 51, 5. vi _s_ ve aditya _h_ adite sa- _g_ osha _h_ asmabhyam _s_ arma\nbahulam vi yanta.\n\np. 245\n\nAll ye \xc3\x82dityas, Aditi together, grant to us your manifold protection!\n\nX, 39, 11. na tam ra _g_ anau adite kuta _h_ _k_ ana na a _m_ ha _h_ a _s_\nnoti du _h_ -itam naki _h_ bhayam.\n\nO ye two kings (the A _s_ vins), Aditi, no evil reaches him from anywhere, no\nmisfortune, no fear (whom you protect). Cf.

There was something beyond that Infinite\nwhich for a time they had grasped by the name of Aditi, and this, whether\nintentionally or by a mere accident of language, they called daksha, literally\npower or the powerful. All this, no doubt, sounds strikingly modern, yet,\nthough the passages in which this daksha is mentioned are few in number, I\nshould not venture to\n\np. 246\n\nsay that they are necessarily modern, even if by modern we mean only later\nthan 1000 b.c. Nothing can bring the perplexity of the ancient mind, if once\ndrawn into this vortex of speculation, more clearly before us than if we read:\n\nX, 72, 4-5. adite _h_ daksha _h_ a _g_ ayata dakshat u _m_ (iti) aditi _h_\npari,--aditi _h_ hi a _g_ anish _t_ a daksha ya\xc2\xb4 duhita\xc2\xb4 tava, ta\xc2\xb4m deva\xc2\xb4 _h_\nanu a _g_ ayanta bhadra\xc2\xb4 _h_ am _r i_ta-bandhava _h_.\n\nDaksha was born of Aditi, and Aditi from Daksha. For Aditi was born, O Daksha,\nshe who is thy daughter; after her the gods were born, the blessed, who share\nin immortality.\n\nOr, in more mythological language:\n\nX, 64, 5. dakshasya va adite _g_ anmani vrate ra\xc2\xb4 _g_ ana mitra\xc2\xb4-varu _n_ a a\xc2\xb4\nvivasasi.\n\nOr thou, O Aditi, nursest in the birthplace of Daksha the two kings, Mitra and\nVaru _n_ a.\n\nNay, even this does not suffice. There is something again beyond Aditi and\nDaksha, and one poet says:\n\nX, 5, 7. asat _k_ a sat _k_ a parame vi-oman dakshasya _g_ anman adite _h_\nupa-sthe.\n\nNot-being and Being are in the highest heaven, in the birthplace of Daksha, in\nthe lap of Aditi.\n\nAt last something like a theogony, though full of contradictions, was\nimagined, and in the same hymn from which we have already quoted, the poet\nsays:\n\nX, 72, 1-4. deva\xc2\xb4nam nu vayam _g_ a\xc2\xb4na pra vo _k_ ama vipanyaya, uktheshu _s_\nasyamaneshu ya _h_ (yat?) pa _s_ yat ut-tare yuge. 1.\n\nbrahma _n_ a _h_ pati _h_ eta\xc2\xb4 sam karma\xc2\xb4ra _h_ -iva adhamat, deva\xc2\xb4nam purvye\nyuge asata _h_ sat a _g_ ayata. 2.\n\ndeva\xc2\xb4nam yuge prathame asata _h_ sat a _g_ ayata, tat a\xc2\xb4 _s_ a _h_ anu a _g_\nayanta tat uttana-pada _h_ pari. 3.\n\nbhu\xc2\xb4 _h_ _g_ a _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ e uttana-pada _h_ bhuva _h_ a\xc2\xb4 _s_ a _h_ a _g_ ayanta,\nadite _h_ daksha _h_ a _g_ ayata, dakshat u _m_ (iti) aditi _h_ pari. 4.\n\n1\\. Let us now with praise proclaim the births of the gods, that a man may see\nthem in a future age, whenever these hymns are sung.\n\n2\\. Brahma _n_ aspati a blew them together like a smith (with\n\np. 247\n\nhis bellows); in a former age of the gods, Being was born from Not-being.\n\n3\\. In the first age of the gods, Being was born from Not-being, after it were\nborn the Regions (space), from them Uttanapada;\n\n4\\. From Uttanapad the Earth was born, the Regions were born from the Earth.\nDaksha was born of Aditi, and Aditi from Daksha.\n\nThe ideas of Being and Not-being (\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd and \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb4 \xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd) are familiar to the\nHindus from a very early time in their intellectual growth, and they can only\nhave been the result of abstract speculation. Therefore daksha, too, in the\nsense of power or potentia, may have been a metaphysical conception. But it\nmay also have been suggested by a mere accident of language, a never-failing\nsource of ancient thoughts. The name daksha-pitara _h_ , an epithet of the\ngods, has generally been translated by \'those who have Daksha for their\nfather.\' But it may have been used originally in a very different sense.\nProfessor Roth has, I think, convincingly proved that this epithet daksha-\npitar, as given to certain gods, does not mean, the gods who have Daksha for\ntheir father, but that it had originally the simpler meaning of fathers of\nstrength, or, as he translates it, \'preserving, possessing, granting faculties\na.\' This is particularly clear in one passage:\n\nIII, 27, 9. bhuta\xc2\xb4nam garbham a\xc2\xb4 dadhe, dakshasya, pitaram.\n\nI place Agni, the source of all beings, the father of strength \xe2\x80\xa6\n\np. 248\n\nAfter this we can hardly hesitate how to translate the next verse:\n\nVI, 50, 2. su- _g_ yotisha _h_ --daksha-pit _r i_n--deva\xc2\xb4n.\n\nThe resplendent gods, the fathers of strength.\n\nIt may seem more doubtful, when we come to gods like Mitra and Varu _n_ a,\nwhom we are so much accustomed to regard as \xc3\x82dityas, or sons of Aditi, and who\ntherefore, according to the theogony mentioned before, would have the best\nclaim to the name of sons of Daksha; yet here, too, the original and simple\nmeaning is preferable; nay, it is most likely that from passages like this,\nthe later explanation, which makes Mitra and Varu _n_ a the sons of Daksha,\nmay have sprung.\n\nVII, 66, 2. ya\xc2\xb4--su-daksha daksha-pitara.\n\nMitra and Varu _n_ a, who are of good strength, the fathers of strength.\n\nLastly, even men may claim this name; for, unless we change the accent, we\nmust translate:\n\nVIII, 63, 10. avasyava _h_ yushma\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ daksha-pitara _h_.\n\nWe suppliants, being, through your aid, fathers of strength.\n\nBut whatever view we take, whether we take daksha in the sense of power, as a\npersonification of a philosophical conception, or as the result of a\nmythological misunderstanding occasioned by the name of daksha-pitar, the fact\nremains that in certain hymns of the Rig-veda (VIII, 25, 5) Daksha, like\nAditi, has become a divine person, and has retained his place as one of the\n\xc3\x82dityas to the very latest time of Pura _n_ ic tradition.\n\nAditi in her Cosmic Character.\n\nBut to return to Aditi. Let us look upon her as the Infinite personified, and\nmost passages, even those where she is presented as a subordinate deity, will\nbecome intelligible.\n\nAditi, in her cosmic character, is the Beyond, the unbounded realm beyond\nearth, sky, and heaven, and originally she was distinct from the sky, the\nearth, and the ocean. Aditi is mentioned by the side of heaven and earth,\nwhich\n\np. 249\n\nshows that, though in more general language she may be identified with heaven\nand earth in their unlimited character, her original conception was different.\nThis we see in passages where different deities or powers are invoked\ntogether, particularly if they are invoked together in the same verse, and\nwhere Aditi holds a separate place by the side of heaven and earth:\n\nI, 94, 16 (final). tat na _h_ mitra _h_ varu _n_ a _h_ mamahantam aditi _h_\nsindhu _h_ p _ri_ thivi\xc2\xb4 uta dyau _h_.\n\nMay Mitra and Varu _n_ a grant us this, may Aditi, Sindhu (sea), the Earth,\nand the Sky!\n\nIn other passages, too, where Aditi has assumed a more personal character, she\nstill holds her own by the side of heaven and earth; cf.

There are the grand and beautiful Morning and Night, Heaven and Earth,\nVaru _n_ a, Mitra, Aryaman; I call Indra, the Maruts, the Waters, the \xc3\x82dityas,\nHeaven and Earth, the Waters, the Heaven.\n\n2\\. May Heaven and Earth, the provident, the righteous, preserve us from sin\nand mischief! May the malevolent Nir _ri_ ti not rule over us! This blessing\nof the gods we ask for to-day.\n\n3\\. May Aditi protect us from all sin, the mother of Mitra and of the rich\nVaru _n_ a! May we obtain heavenly light without enemies! This blessing of the\ngods we ask for to-day.\n\nHere we cannot but admit that Dya\xc2\xb4vaksha\xc2\xb4ma, heaven and earth, is meant for\nthe same divine couple as Dya\xc2\xb4vap _ri_ thivi\xc2\xb4, heaven and earth, although\nunder slightly differing names they are invoked separately. The waters are\ninvoked twice in the same verse and under the same name; nor is there any\nindication that, as in other passages, the waters of the sky are meant as\ndistinct from the waters of the sea. Nevertheless even here, Aditi, who in the\nthird verse is called distinctly the mother of Mitra and Varu _n_ a, cannot\nwell have been meant for the same deity as Heaven and Earth, mentioned in the\nsecond verse; and the author of\n\np. 251\n\nthese two verses, while asking the same blessing from both, must have been\naware of the original independent character of Aditi.\n\nAditi as Mother.\n\nIn this character of a deity of the far East, of an Orient in the true sense\nof the word, Aditi was naturally thought of as the mother of certain gods,\nparticularly of those that were connected with the daily rising and setting of\nthe sun. If it was asked whence comes the dawn, or the sun, or whence come day\nand night, or Mitra and Varu _n_ a, or any of the bright, solar, eastern\ndeities, the natural answer was that they come from the Orient, that they are\nthe sons of Aditi. Thus we read in\n\nIX, 74, 3. urvi\xc2\xb4 gavyuti _h_ adite _h_ _ri_ tam yate.\n\nWide is the space for him who goes on the right path of Aditi.\n\nIn VIII, 25, 3, we are told that Aditi bore Mitra and Varu _n_ a, and these in\nverse 5 are called the sons of Daksha (power), and the grandsons of _S_ avas,\nwhich again means might: napata _s_ avasa _h_ mana _h_ sunu\xc2\xb4 (iti) dakshasya\nsu-kratu (iti). In X, 36, 3, Aditi is called the mother of Mitra and Varu _n_\na; likewise in X, 132, 6; see also VI, 67, 4. In VIII, 47, 9, Aditi is called\nthe mother of Mitra, Aryaman, Varu _n_ a, who in VII, 60, 5 are called her\nsons. In X, 11, 1, Varu _n_ a is called yahva _h_ adite _h_ , the son of Aditi\n(cf. VIII, 19, 12); in VII, 41, 2, Bhaga is mentioned as her son. In X, 72, 8,\nwe hear of eight sons of Aditi, but it is added that she approached the gods\nwith seven sons only, and that the eighth (marta _n_ _d_ a, addled egg) was\nthrown away: ash _t_ au putra\xc2\xb4sa _h_ adite _h_ ye _g_ ata\xc2\xb4 _h_ tanva\xcc\x83 _h_\npari, deva\xc2\xb4n upa pra ait sapta-bhi _h_ para marta _n_ _d_ am asyat.\n\nIn X, 63, 2, the gods in general are represented as born from Aditi, the\nwaters, and the earth: ye stha _g_ ata\xc2\xb4 _h_ adite _h_ at-bhya _h_ pari ye p\n_ri_ thivya\xc2\xb4 _h_ te me iha _s_ ruta havam.\n\nYou who are born of Aditi, from the water, you who are born of the earth, hear\nye all my call!\n\nThe number seven, with regard to the \xc3\x82dityas, occurs also in\n\np. 252\n\nIX, 114, 3. sapta di _s_ a _h_ na\xc2\xb4na-surya _h_ sapta hotara _h_ _ri_ tvi _g_ a\n_h_ , deva\xc2\xb4 _h_ aditya\xc2\xb4 _h_ ye sapta tebhi _h_ soma abhi raksha na _h_.\n\nThere are seven regions with their different suns, there are seven Hotars as\npriests, those who are the seven gods, the \xc3\x82dityas, with them, O Soma, protect\nus!\n\nThe Seven \xc3\x82dityas.\n\nThis number of seven \xc3\x82dityas requires an explanation. To say that seven is a\nsolemn or sacred number is to say very little, for however solemn or sacred\nthat number may be elsewhere, it is not more sacred than any other number in\nthe Veda. The often-mentioned seven rivers have a real geographical\nfoundation, like the seven hills of Rome. The seven flames or treasures of\nAgni (V, 1, 5) and of Soma and Rudra (VI, 74, I), the seven paridhis or logs\nat certain sacrifices (X, 90, 15), the seven Harits or horses of the sun, the\nseven Hotar priests (III, 7, 7; 10, 4), the seven cities of the enemy\ndestroyed by Indra (I, 63, 7), and even the seven _Ri_ shis (X, 82, 2; 109,\n4), all these do not prove that the number of seven was more sacred than the\nnumber of one or three or five or ten used in the Veda in a very similar way.\nWith regard to the seven \xc3\x82dityas, however, we are still able to see that their\nnumber of seven or eight had something to do with solar movements. If their\nnumber had always been eight, we should feel inclined to trace the number of\nthe \xc3\x82dityas back to the eight regions, or the eight cardinal points of the\nheaven. Thus we read:\n\nI, 35, 8. ash _t_ au vi akhyat kakubha _h_ p _ri_ thivya\xc2\xb4 _h_.\n\nThe god Savitar lighted up the eight points of the earth (not the eight\nhills).\n\nBut we have seen already that though the number of \xc3\x82dityas was originally\nsupposed to have been eight, it was reduced to seven, and this could hardly be\nsaid in any sense of the eight points of the compass. Cf. Taitt. \xc3\x82r. I, 7, 6.\n\nAs we cannot think in ancient India of the seven planets, I can only suggest\nthe seven days or tithis of the four parvans of the lunar month as a possible\nprototype of the\n\np. 253\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc3\x82dityas. This might even explain the destruction of the\neighth \xc3\x82ditya, considering that the eighth day of each parvan, owing to its\nuncertainty, might be represented as exposed to decay and destruction. This\nwould explain such passages as,\n\nIV, 7, 5. ya _g_ ish _th_ am sapta dha\xc2\xb4ma-bhi _h_.\n\nAgni, most worthy of sacrifice in the seven stations.\n\nIX, 102, 2. ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya sapta dha\xc2\xb4ma-bhi _h_.\n\nIn the seven stations of the sacrifice.\n\nThe seven threads of the sacrifice may have the same origin:\n\nII, 5, 2. a\xc2\xb4 yasmin sapta ra _s_ maya _h_ tata\xc2\xb4 _h_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ asya netari,\nmanushvat daivyam ash _t_ amam.\n\nIn whom, as the leader of the sacrifice, the seven threads are stretched out,\n--the eighth divine being is manlike (?).\n\nThe sacrifice itself is called, X, 124, 1, sapta-tantu, having seven threads.\n\nX, 122, 3. sapta dha\xc2\xb4mani pari-yan amartya _h_.\n\nAgni, the immortal, who goes round the seven stations.\n\nX, 8, 4. ushah-usha _h_ hi vaso (iti) agram eshi tvam yamayo _h_ abhava _h_\nvi-bha\xc2\xb4va, _ri_ ta\xc2\xb4ya sapta dadhishe pada\xc2\xb4ni _g_ anayan mitram tanve\xcc\x83 sva\xc2\xb4yai.\n\nFor thou, Vasu (Agni), comest first every morning, thou art the illuminator of\nthe twins (day and night). Thou holdest the seven places for the sacrifice,\ncreating Mitra (the sun) for thy own body.\n\nX, 5, 6. sapta marya\xc2\xb4da _h_ kavaya _h_ tatakshu _h_ ta\xc2\xb4sam ekam it abhi a _m_\nhura _h_ gat.\n\nThe sages established the seven divisions, but mischief befell one of them.\n\nI, 22, 16. ata _h_ deva\xc2\xb4 _h_ avantu na _h_ yata _h_ vish _n_ u _h_ vi- _k_\nakrame p _ri_ thivya\xc2\xb4 _h_ sapta dha\xc2\xb4ma-bhi _h_.\n\nMay the gods protect us from whence Vish _n_ u strode forth, by the seven\nstations of the earth!\n\nEven the names of the seven or eight \xc3\x82dityas are not definitely known, at\nleast not from the hymns of the Rig-veda. In II, 27, 1, we have a list of six\nnames: Mitra, Aryaman, Bhaga, Varu _n_ a, Daksha, \xc3\x81 _m_ _s_ a _h_. These with\nAditi would give us seven. In VI, 50, 1, we have \xc3\x81diti,\n\np. 254\n\n[paragraph continues] Varu _n_ a, Mitra, Agni, Aryaman, Savitar, and Bhaga. In\nI, 89, 3, Bhaga, Mitra, \xc3\x81diti, Daksha, Aryaman, Varu _n_ a, Soma, A _s_ vina,\nand Sarasvati are invoked together with an old invocation, pu\xc2\xb4rvaya ni-vida.\nIn the Taittiriya-ara _n_ yaka, I, 13, 3, we find the following list: 1.\nMitra, 2. Varu _n_ a, 3. Dhatar, 4. Aryaman, 5. A _m_ _s_ a, 6. Bhaga, 7.\nIndra, 8. Vivasvat, but there, too, the eighth son is said to be Marta _n_ _d_\na, or, according to the commentator, \xc3\x82ditya.\n\nThe character of Aditi as the mother of certain gods is also indicated by some\nof her epithets, such as ra\xc2\xb4 _g_ a-putra, having kings for her sons; su-\nputra\xc2\xb4, having good sons; ugra-putra, having terrible sons:\n\nII, 27, 7. pipartu na _h_ aditi _h_ ra\xc2\xb4 _g_ a-putra ati dvesha _m_ si aryama\xc2\xb4\nsu-gebhi _h_ , b _ri_ hat mitrasya varu _n_ asya _s_ arma upa syama puru-vi\xc2\xb4ra\n_h_ arish _t_ a _h_.\n\nMay Aditi with her royal sons, may Aryaman carry us on easy roads across the\nhatreds; may we with many sons and without hurt obtain the great protection of\nMitra and Varu _n_ a!\n\nIII, 4, 11. barhi _h_ na _h_ astam aditi _h_ su-putra\xc2\xb4.\n\nMay Aditi with her excellent sons sit on our sacred pile!\n\nVIII, 67, 11. parshi dine gabhire a\xc2\xb4 ugra-putre _g_ igha _m_ sata _h_ , ma\xc2\xb4ki\n_h_ tokasya na _h_ rishat.\n\nProtect us, O goddess with terrible sons, from the enemy in shallow or deep\nwater, and no one will hurt our offspring!\n\nAditi identified with other Deities.\n\nAditi, however, for the very reason that she was originally intended for the\nInfinite, for something beyond the visible world, was liable to be identified\nwith a number of finite deities which might all be represented as resting on\nAditi, as participating in Aditi, as being Aditi. Thus we read:\n\nI, 89, 10 (final). aditi _h_ dyau _h_ aditi _h_ antariksham aditi _h_ mata\xc2\xb4 sa\n_h_ pita\xc2\xb4 sa _h_ putra _h_ , vi _s_ ve deva\xc2\xb4 _h_ aditi _h_ pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _g_\nana _h_ aditi _h_ _g_ atam aditi _h_ _g_ ani-tvam.\n\nAditi is the heaven, Aditi the sky, Aditi the mother, the\n\np. 255\n\nfather, the son. All the gods are Aditi, the five clans, the past is Aditi,\nAditi is the future.\n\nBut although Aditi may thus be said to be everything, heaven, sky, and all the\ngods, no passage occurs, in the Rig-veda at least, where the special meaning\nof heaven or earth is expressed by Aditi. In X, 63, 3, where Aditi seems to\nmean sky, we shall see that it ought to be taken as a masculine, either in the\nsense of \xc3\x82ditya, or as an epithet, unbounded, immortal. In I, 72, 9, we ought\nprobably to read p _ri_ thvi\xc2\xb4 and pronounce p _ri_ thuvi\xc2\xb4, and translate \'the\nwide Aditi, the mother with her sons;\' and not, as Benfey does, \'the Earth,\nthe eternal mother.\'\n\nIt is more difficult to determine whether in one passage Aditi has not been\nused in the sense of life after life, or as the name of the place whither\npeople went after death, or of the deity presiding over that place. In a well-\nknown hymn, supposed to have been uttered by _S_ una _h_ _s_ epa when on the\npoint of being sacrificed by his own father, the following verse occurs:\n\nI, 24, 1. ka _h_ na _h_ mahyai aditaye puna _h_ dat, pitaram _k_ a d _ri_ _s_\neyam mataram _k_ a.\n\nWho will give us back to the great Aditi, that I may see father and mother?\n\nAs the supposed utterer of this hymn is still among the living, Aditi can\nhardly be taken in the sense of earth, nor would the wish to see father and\nmother be intelligible in the mouth of one who is going to he sacrificed by\nhis own father. If we discard the story of _S_ una _h_ _s_ epa, and take the\nhymn as uttered by any poet who craves for the protection of the gods in the\npresence of danger and death, then we may choose between the two meanings of\nearth or liberty, and translate, either, Who will give us back to the great\nearth? or, Who will restore us to the great Aditi, the goddess of freedom?\n\nAditi and Diti.\n\nThere is one other passage which might receive light if we could take Aditi in\nthe sense of Hades, but I give this translation as a mere guess:\n\np. 256\n\nIV, 2, 11. raye _k_ a na _h_ su-apatya\xc2\xb4ya deva ditim _k_ a ra\xc2\xb4sva aditim\nurushya.\n\nThat we may enjoy our wealth and healthy offspring, give us this life on\nearth, keep off the life to come! Cf. I, 152, 6.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that Diti occurs in the Rig-veda thrice only, and\nin one passage it should, I believe, be changed into Aditi. This passage\noccurs in VII, 15, 12. tvam agne vira-vat ya _s_ a _h_ deva _h_ ka savita\xc2\xb4\nbhaga _h_ , diti _h_ _k_ a dati va\xc2\xb4ryam. Here the name of Diti is so unusual,\nand that of Aditi, on the contrary, so natural, that I have little doubt that\nthe poet had put the name of Aditi; and that later reciters, not aware of the\noccasional license of putting two short syllables instead of one, changed it\ninto Aditi. If we remove this passage, then Diti, in the Rig-veda at least,\noccurs twice only, and each time together or in contrast with Aditi; cf. V,\n62, 8, page 243. I have no doubt, therefore, that Professor Roth is right when\nhe says that Diti is a being without any definite conception, a mere reflex of\nAditi. We can clearly watch her first emergence into existence through what is\nhardly more than a play of words, whereas in the epic and Pura _n_ ic\nliterature this Diti (like the Suras) has grown into a definite person, one of\nthe daughters of Daksha, the wife of Ka _s_ yapa, the mother of the enemies of\nthe gods, the Daityas. Such is the growth of legend, mythology and religion!\n\nAditi in her Moral Character.\n\nBesides the cosmical character of Aditi, which we have hitherto examined, this\ngoddess has also assumed a very prominent moral character. Aditi, like Varu\n_n_ a, delivers from sin. Why this should be so, we can still understand if we\nwatch the transition which led from a purely cosmical to a moral conception of\nAditi. Sin in the Veda is frequently conceived as a bond or a chain from which\nthe repentant sinner wishes to be freed:\n\nVII, 86, 5. ava drugdha\xc2\xb4ni pitrya s _ri_ _g_ a na _h_ ava ya\xc2\xb4 vayam _k_ ak\n_ri_ ma tanu\xc2\xb4bhi _h_ , ava ra _g_ an pa _s_ u-t _r i_pam na tayum s _ri_ _g_ a\nvatsam na da\xc2\xb4mna _h_ vasish _th_ am.\n\nAbsolve us from the sins of our fathers, and from those\n\np. 257\n\nwhich we have committed with our own bodies. Release Vasish _th_ a, O king,\nlike a thief who has feasted on stolen cattle; release him like a calf from\nthe rope a.\n\nVIII, 67, 14. te na _h_ asna _h_ v _r i_ka _n_ am a\xc2\xb4dityasa _h_ mumo _k_ ata\nstenam baddham-iva adite.\n\nO \xc3\x82dityas, deliver us from the mouth of the wolves, like a bound thief, O\nAditi! Cf. VIII, 67, 18.\n\n_S_ una _h_ _s_ epa, who, as we saw before, wishes to be restored to the great\nAditi, is represented as bound (dita) by ropes, and in V, 2, 7, we read:\n\n_s_ una _h_ - _s_ epam _k_ it ni-ditam sahasrat yu\xc2\xb4pat amu _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a _h_ a _s_\namish _t_ a hi sa _h_ , eva asmat agne vi mumugdhi pa\xc2\xb4 _s_ an hotar (iti) _k_\nikitva _h_ iha tu ni-sadya.\n\nO Agni, thou hast released the bound _S_ una _h_ _s_ epa from the stake, for\nhe had prayed; thus take from us, too, these ropes, O sagacious Hotar, after\nthou hast settled here.\n\nExpressions like these, words like da\xc2\xb4man, bond, ni-dita, bound, naturally\nsuggested a-diti, the un-bound or unbounded, as one of those deities who could\nbest remove the bonds of sin or misery. If we once realise this concatenation\nof thought and language, many passages of the Veda that seemed obscure, will\nbecome intelligible.\n\nVII, 51, 1. aditya\xc2\xb4nam avasa nu\xc2\xb4tanena sakshimahi _s_ arma _n_ a _s_ am-\ntamena, anaga _h_ -tve aditi-tve tura\xc2\xb4sa _h_ imam ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am dadhatu _s_\nroshama _n_ a _h_.\n\nMay we obtain the new favour of the \xc3\x82dityas, their best protection; may the\nquick Maruts listen and place this sacrifice in guiltlessness and Aditi-hood.\n\nI have translated the last words literally, in order to make their meaning\nquite clear. \xc3\x82\xc2\xb4gas has the same meaning as the Greek \xe1\xbc\x84\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, guilt, abomination;\nan-agas-tva, therefore, as applied to a sacrifice or to the man who makes it,\nmeans guiltlessness, purity. Aditi-tva, Aditi-hood, has a similar meaning, it\nmeans freedom from bonds, from anything that hinders the proper performance of\na religious act; it may come to mean perfection or holiness.\n\np. 258\n\nAditi having once been conceived as granting this adititva, soon assumed a\nvery definite moral character, and hence the following invocations:\n\nI, 24, 15. ut ut-tamam varu _n_ a pa\xc2\xb4 _s_ am asmat ava adhamam vi madhyamim\n_s_ rathaya, atha vayam aditya vrate tava anagasa _h_ aditaye syama.\n\nO Varu _n_ a, lift the highest rope, draw off the lowest, remove the middle;\nthen, O \xc3\x82ditya, let us be in thy service free of guilt before Aditi.\n\nV, 82, 6. anagasa _h_ aditaye devasya savitu _h_ _h_ save, vi _s_ va vama\xc2\xb4ni\ndhimahi.\n\nMay we, guiltless before Aditi, and in the keeping of the god Savitar, obtain\nall goods! Professor Roth here translates Aditi by freedom or security.\n\nI, 162, 22. anaga _h_ -tvam na _h_ aditi _h_ k _ri_ _n_ otu.\n\nMay Aditi give us sinlessness! Cf.

Whatever sin we have committed, do thou pardon it! May Aryaman,\nAditi loose it!\n\nHere the plural _s_ i _s_ rathantu should be observed, instead of the dual.\n\nVIII, 18, 6-7. aditi _h_ na _h_ diva pa _s_ um aditi _h_ naktam advaya _h_ ,\naditi _h_ patu a _m_ hasa _h_ sada\xc2\xb4-v _ri_ dha.\n\nuta sya\xc2\xb4 na _h_ diva mati _h_ aditi _h_ utya\xc2\xb4 a\xc2\xb4 gamat, sa _s_ am-tati maya\n_h_ karat apa sridha _h_.\n\nMay Aditi by day protect our cattle, may she, who never deceives, protect by\nnight; may she, with steady increase, protect us from evil!\n\nAnd may she, the thoughtful Aditi, come with help to\n\np. 259\n\nus by day; may she kindly bring happiness to us, and carry away all enemies!\nCf.

Protect us always with\nyour blessings!\n\nLastly, Aditi, like all other gods, is represented as a giver of worldly\ngoods, and implored to bestow them on her worshippers, or to protect them by\nher power:\n\nI, 43, 2. yatha na _h_ aditi _h_ karat pa _s_ ve n _r i_-bhya _h_ yatha gave,\nyatha toka\xc2\xb4ya rudriyam.\n\nThat Aditi may bring Rudra\'s favour to our cattle, our men, our cow, our\noffspring.\n\nI, 153, 3. pipa\xc2\xb4ya dhenu _h_ aditi _h_ _ri_ ta\xc2\xb4ya _g_ anaya mitravaru _n_ a\nhavi _h_ -de.\n\nAditi, the cow, gives food to the righteous man, O Mitra and Varu _n_ a, who\nmakes offerings to the gods.

Cf. II, 40, 6; IV, 25, 5; X, 11, 2.\n\nThe principal epithets of Aditi have been mentioned in the passages quoted\nabove, and they throw no further light on the nature of the goddess. She was\ncalled devi\xc2\xb4, goddess, again and again; another frequent epithet is anarvan,\nuninjured, unscathed. Being invoked to grant light (VII, 82, 10), she is\nherself called luminous, _g_ yotishmati, I, 136, 3; and sva\xc2\xb4rvati, heavenly.\nBeing the goddess of the infinite expanse, she, even with greater right than\nthe dawn, is called uru _k_ i, VIII, 67, 12; uruvya _k_ as, V, 46, 6; uruvra\n_g_ a, VIII, 67, 12; and possibly p _ri_ thvi\xc2\xb4 in I, 72, 9. As supporting\neverything, she is called dharayatkshiti, supporting the earth, I, 136, 3; and\nvi _s_ va _g_ anya, VII, 10, 4. To her sons she owes the names of ra\xc2\xb4 _g_\naputra, II, 27, 7; suputra\xc2\xb4, III, 4, 11; and ugraputra, VIII, 67, 11: to her\nwealth that of sudravi _n_ as, I, 94, 15, though others refer this epithet to\nAgni. There remains one name pastya\xcc\x83, IV, 55, 3; VIII, 27, 5, meaning\nhousewife, which again indicates her character as mother of the gods.\n\n\n\nI have thus given all the evidence that can be collected from the Rig-veda as\nthrowing light on the character of the goddess Aditi, and I have carefully\nexcluded everything that rests only on the authority of the Ya _g_ ur- or\nAtharva-vedas, or of the Brahma _n_ as and \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas, because in all they\ngive beyond the repetitions from the Rig-veda, they seem to me to represent a\nlater phase of thought that ought not to be mixed up with the more primitive\nconceptions of the Rig-veda. Not that the Rig-veda is free from what seems\ndecidedly modern, or at all events secondary and late. But it is well to keep\nthe great collections, as such,\n\np. 261\n\nseparate, whatever our opinions may be as to the age of their component parts.\n\nIn the Atharva-veda Aditi appears more unintelligible, more completely\nmythological, than in the Rig-veda. We read, for instance, Atharva-veda VII,\n6, 1:\n\n\'Aditi is the sky, Aditi is the welkin, Aditi is mother, is father, is son;\nall the gods are Aditi, and the five clans of men; Aditi is what was, Aditi is\nwhat will be.\n\n\'We invoke for our protection the great mother of the well-ruling gods, the\nwife of _Ri_ ta, the powerful, never-aging, far-spreading, the sheltering,\nwell-guiding Aditi.\'\n\nIn the Taittiriya-ara _n_ yaka and similar works the mythological confusion\nbecomes greater still. Much valuable material for an analytical study of Aditi\nmay be found in B. and R.\'s Dictionary, and in several of Dr. Muir\'s excellent\ncontributions to a knowledge of Vedic theogony and mythology.\n\nAditi as an Adjective.\n\nBut although the foregoing remarks give as complete a description of Aditi as\ncan be gathered from the hymns of the Rig-veda, a few words have to be added\non certain passages where the word aditi occurs, and where it clearly cannot\nmean the goddess Aditi, as a feminine, but must be taken either as the name of\na corresponding masculine deity, or as an adjective in the sense of\nunrestrained, independent, free.\n\nV, 59, 8. mimatu dyau _h_ aditi _h_ vitaye na _h_.\n\nMay the boundless Dyu (sky) help us to our repast!\n\nHere Aditi must either be taken in the sense of \xc3\x82ditya, or better in its\noriginal sense of unbounded, as an adjective belonging to Dyu, the masculine\ndeity of the sky.\n\nDyu or the sky is called aditi or unbounded in another passage, X, 63, 3:\n\nyebhya _h_ mata\xc2\xb4 madhu-mat pinvate paya _h_ piyu\xc2\xb4sham dyau _h_ aditi _h_ adri-\nbarha _h_.\n\nThe gods to whom their mother yields the sweet milk, and the unbounded sky, as\nfirm as a rock, their food.\n\nIV, 3, 8. katha\xc2\xb4 _s_ ardhaya marutam _ri_ ta\xc2\xb4ya katha\xc2\xb4 sure b _ri_ hate p _ri_\n_k_ _kh_ yamana _h_ , prati brava _h_ aditaye tura\xc2\xb4ya.\n\np. 262\n\nHow wilt thou tell it to the host of the Maruts, how to the bright heaven,\nwhen thou art asked? How to the quick Aditi?\n\nHere Aditi cannot be the goddess, partly on account of the masculine gender of\ntura\xc2\xb4ya, partly because she is never called quick. Aditi must here be the name\nof one of the \xc3\x82dityas, or it may refer back to sure b _ri_ hate. It can hardly\nbe joined, as Professor Roth proposes, with _s_ ardhaya marutam, owing to the\nintervening sure b _ri_ hate.\n\nIn several passages aditi, as an epithet, refers to Agni:\n\nIV, 1, 20 (final). vi _s_ vesham aditi _h_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iyanam vi _s_ vesham\natithi _h_ ma\xc2\xb4nusha _n_ am.\n\nHe, Agni, the Aditi, or the freest, among all the gods; he the guest among all\nmen.\n\nThe same play on the words aditi and atithi occurs again:\n\nVII, 9, 3. amura _h_ kavi _h_ aditi _h_ vivasvan su-sa _m_ sat mitra _h_\natithi _h_ _s_ iva _h_ na _h_ , _k_ itra-bhanu _h_ ushasam bhati agre.\n\nThe wise poet, Aditi, Vivasvat, Mitra with his good company, our welcome\nguest, he (Agni) with brilliant light came at the head of the dawns.\n\nHere, though I admit that several renderings are possible, Aditi is meant as a\nname of Agni, to whom the whole hymn is addressed, and who, as usual, is\nidentified with other gods, or, at all events, invoked by their names. We may\ntranslate aditi _h_ vivasvan by \'the brilliant Aditi,\' or \'the unchecked, the\nbrilliant,\' or by \'the boundless Vivasvat,\' but on no account can we take\naditi here as the female goddess. The same applies to VIII, 19, 14, where\nAditi, unless we suppose the goddess brought in in the most abrupt way, must\nbe taken as a name of Agni; while in X, 92, 14, aditim anarva _n_ am, to judge\nfrom other epithets given in the same verse, has most likely to be taken again\nas an appellative of Agni. In some passages it would, no doubt, be possible to\ntake Aditi as the name of a female deity, if it were certain that no other\nmeaning could be assigned to this word. But if we once know that Aditi was the\nname of a male deity also, the structure of these passages becomes far more\nperfect, if we take Aditi in that sense:\n\np. 263\n\nIV, 39, 3. anagasam tam aditi _h_ k _ri_ _n_ otu sa _h_ mitre _n_ a varu _n_\nena sa- _g_ osha _h_.\n\nMay Aditi make him free from sin, he who is allied with Mitra and Varu _n_ a.\n\nWe have had several passages in which Aditi, the female deity, is represented\nas sa _g_ osha _h_ or allied with other \xc3\x82dityas, but if sa _h_ is the right\nreading here, Aditi in this verse can only be the male deity. The pronoun sa\ncannot refer to tam.\n\nWith regard to other passages, such as IX, 81, 5; VI, 51, 3, and even some of\nthose translated above in which Aditi has been taken as a female goddess, the\nquestion must be left open till further evidence can be obtained. There is\nonly one more passage which has been often discussed, and where aditi was\nsupposed to have the meaning of earth:\n\nVII, 18, 8. du _h_ -adhya\xcc\x83 _h_ aditim srevayanta _h_ a _k_ etasa _h_ vi _g_ ag\n_ri_ bhre parush _n_ im.\n\nProfessor Roth in one of his earliest essays translated this line, \'The evil-\ndisposed wished to dry the earth, the fools split the Parush _n_ i,\' and he\nsupposed its meaning to have been that the enemies of Sudas swam across the\nParush _n_ i in order to attack Sudas. We might accept this translation, if it\ncould be explained how by throwing themselves into the river, the enemies made\nthe earth dry, though even then there would remain this difficulty that, with\nthe exception of one other doubtful passage, discussed before, aditi never\nmeans earth. We might possibly translate: \'The evil-disposed, the fools, laid\ndry and divided the boundless river Parush _n_ i.\' This would be a description\nof a stratagem very common in ancient warfare, viz. diverting the course of a\nriver and laying its original bed dry by digging a new channel, and thus\ndividing the old river. This is also the sense accepted by Saya _n_ a, who\ndoes not say that vigraha means dividing the waves of a river, as Professor\nRoth renders kulabheda, but that it means dividing or cutting through its\nbanks. In the Dictionary Professor Roth assigns to aditi in this passage the\nmeaning of endless, inexhaustible.\n\np. 264\n\nKana.\n\nNote 5. Nothing is more difficult in the interpretation of the Veda than to\ngain an accurate knowledge of the power of particles and conjunctions. The\nparticle _k_ ana, we are told, is used both affirmatively and negatively, a\nstatement which shows better than anything else the uncertainty to which every\ntranslation of Vedic hymns is as yet exposed. It is perfectly true that in the\ntext of the Rig-veda, as we now read it, kana means both indeed and no. But\nthis very fact shows that we ought to distinguish where the first collectors\nof the Vedic hymns have not distinguished, and that while in the former case\nwe read _k_ ana, we ought in the latter to read _k_ a na.\n\nI begin with those passages in which _k_ ana is used emphatically, though\noriginally it may have been a double negation.\n\nI a. In negative sentences:\n\nI, 18, 7. yasmat _ri_ te na sidhyati ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_ vipa _h_ - _k_ ita _h_\n_k_ ana.\n\nWithout whom the sacrifice does not succeed, not even that of the sage.\n\nV, 34, 5. na asunvata sa _k_ ate pushyata _k_ ana.\n\nHe does not cling to a man who offers no libations, even though he be\nthriving.\n\nI, 24, 6. nahi te kshatram na saha _h_ na manyum vaya _h_ _k_ ana ami\xc2\xb4 (iti)\npatayanta _h_ apu _h_.\n\nFor thy power, thy strength, thy anger even these birds which fly up, do not\nreach. Cf. I, 100, 15.\n\nI, 155, 5. t _ri_ ti\xc2\xb4yam asya naki _h_ a\xc2\xb4 dadharshati vaya _h_ _k_ ana\npatayanta _h_ patatri _n_ a _h_.\n\nThis third step no one approaches, not even the winged birds which fly up.\n\nI, 55, 1. diva _h_ _k_ it asya varima\xc2\xb4 vi papratha, indram na mahna\xc2\xb4 p _ri_\nthivi\xc2\xb4 _k_ ana prati.\n\nThe width of the heavens is stretched out, even the earth in her greatness is\nno match for Indra.\n\nI b. In positive sentences:\n\nVII, 32, 13. purvi\xc2\xb4 _h_ _k_ ana pra-sitaya _h_ taranti tam ya _h_ indre karma\n_n_ a bhuvat.\n\np. 265\n\nEven many snares pass him who is with Indra in his work.\n\nVIII, 2, 14. uktham _k_ ana _s_ asyamanam ago _h_ ari _h_ a\xc2\xb4 _k_ iketa, na\ngayatram giyamanam.\n\nHe (Indra) marks indeed a poor man\'s prayer that is recited, but not a hymn\nthat is sung. (Doubtful.)\n\nVIII, 78, 10. tava it indra aham a- _s_ asa haste da\xc2\xb4tram _k_ ana a\xc2\xb4 dade.\n\nHoping in thee alone, O Indra, I take even this sickle in my hand.\n\nI, 55, 5. adha _k_ ana _s_ rat dadhati tvishi-mate indraya va _g_ ram ni-\nghanighnate vadham.\n\nThen indeed they believe in Indra, the majestic, when he hurls the bolt to\nstrike.\n\nI, 152, 2. etat _k_ ana tva _h_ vi _k_ iketat esham.\n\nDoes one of them understand even this?\n\nIV, 18, 9. mamat kana used in the same sense as mamat _k_ it.\n\nI, 139, 2. dhibhi _h_ _k_ ana manasa svebhi _h_ aksha-bhi _h_.\n\nV, 41, 13. vaya _h_ _k_ ana su-bhva\xcc\x83 _h_ a\xc2\xb4 ava yanti.\n\nVII, 18, 9. a _s_ u _h_ _k_ ana it abhi-pitvam _g_ agama.\n\nVIII, 91, 3. a\xc2\xb4 _k_ ana tva _k_ ikitsama _h_ adhi kana tva na imasi.\n\nWe wish to know thee, indeed, but we cannot understand thee.\n\nX, 49, 5. aham randhayam m _r i_gayam _s_ rutarva _n_ e yat ma a _g_ ihita\nvayuna _k_ ana anu-shak.\n\nVI, 26, 7. aham _k_ ana tat suri-bhi _h_ ana _s_ yam.\n\nMay I also obtain this with the lords.\n\nI c. Frequently _k_ ana occurs after interrogative pronouns, to which it\nimparts an indefinite meaning, and principally in negative sentences:\n\nI, 74, 7. na yo _h_ upabdi _h_ a _s_ vya _h_ _s_ _ri_ _n_ ve rathasya kat _k_\nana, yat agne ya\xc2\xb4si dutya\xc2\xb4m.\n\nNo sound of horses is heard, and no sound of the chariot, when thou, O Agni,\ngoest on thy message.\n\nI, 81, 5. na tva\xc2\xb4-van indra ka _h_ _k_ ana na _g_ ata _h_ na _g_ anishyate.\n\nNo one is like thee, O Indra, no one has been born, no one will be!\n\np. 266\n\nI, 84, 20. ma\xc2\xb4 te ra\xc2\xb4dha _m_ si ma\xc2\xb4 to utaya _h_ vaso (iti) asma\xc2\xb4n kada _k_\nana dabhan.\n\nMay thy gifts, may thy help, O Vasu, never fail us!\n\nMany more passages might be given to illustrate the use of _k_ ana or ka _s_\n_k_ ana and its derivatives in negative sentences.\n\nCf. I, 105, 3; 136, 1; 139, 5; II, 16, 3; 23, 5; 28, 6; III, 36, 4; IV, 31, 9;\nV, 42, 6; 82, 2; VI, 3, 2; 20, 4; 47, 1; 3; 48, 17; 54, 9; 59, 4; 69, 8; 75,\n16; VII, 32, 1; 19; 59, 3; 82, 7; 104, 3; VIII, 19, 6; 23, 15; 24, 15; 28, 4;\n47, 7; 64, 27, 66, 13; 68, 19; IX, 61, 27; 69, 6; 114, 4; X, 33, 9; 39, 11;\n48, 5; 49, 10; 59, 8; 62, 9; 85, 3; 86, 11; 95, 1; 112, 9; 119, 6; 7; 128, 4;\n129, 2; 152, 1; 168, 3; 185, 2.\n\nI d. In a few passages, however, we find the indefinite pronoun ka _s_ _k_ ana\nused in sentences which are not negative:\n\nIII, 30, 1. titikshante abhi- _s_ astim _g_ ananam indra tvat a\xc2\xb4 ka _h_ _k_\nana hi pra-keta _h_.\n\nThey bear the scoffing of men; for, Indra, from thee comes every wisdom.\n\nI, 113, 8. usha\xc2\xb4 _h_ m _ri_ tam kam _k_ ana bodhayanti.\n\nUshas, who wakes every dead (or one who is as if dead).\n\nI, 191, 7. ad _ri_ sh _t_ a _h_ kim _k_ ana iha va _h_ sarve sakam ni _g_\nasyata.\n\nInvisible ones, whatever you are, vanish all together!\n\n\n\nII. We now come to passages in which _k_ ana stands for _k_ a na, and\ntherefore renders the sentence negative without any further negative particle.\nIt might seem possible to escape from this admission, by taking certain\nsentences in an interrogative sense. But this would apply to certain sentences\nonly, and would seem forced even there:\n\nII, 16, 2. yasmat indrat b _ri_ hata _h_ kim _k_ ana im _ri_ te. Beside whom,\n(beside) the great Indra, there is not anything.\n\nII, 24, 12. vi _s_ vam satyam magha-vana yuvo _h_ it a\xc2\xb4pa _h_ _k_ ana pra\nminanti vratam vam.\n\nEverything, you mighty ones, belongs indeed to you; even the waters do not\ntransgress your law.\n\np. 267\n\nIV, 30, 3. vi _s_ ve _k_ ana it ana\xc2\xb4 tva deva\xc2\xb4sa _h_ indra yuyudhu _h_.\n\nEven all the gods do not ever fight thee, O Indra.\n\nV, 34, 7. du _h_ -ge _k_ ana dhriyate vi _s_ va _h_ a\xc2\xb4 puru _g_ ana _h_ ya _h_\nasya tavishim a _k_ ukrudhat.\n\nEven in a stronghold many a man is not often preserved who has excited his\nanger.\n\nVII, 83, 2. yasmin a _g_ a\xc2\xb4 bhavati kim _k_ ana priyam.\n\nIn which struggle there is nothing good whatsoever.\n\nVII, 86, 6. svapna _h_ kana it an _ri_ tasya pra-yota\xc2\xb4.\n\nEven sleep does not remove all evil.\n\nIn this passage I formerly took _k_ ana as affirmative, not as negative, and\ntherefore assigned to prayota\xc2\xb4 the same meaning which Saya _n_ a assigns to\nit, one who brings or mixes, whereas it ought to be, as rightly seen by Roth,\none who removes.\n\nVIII, 1, 5. mahe _k_ ana tva\xc2\xb4m adri-va _h_ para _s_ ulka\xc2\xb4ya deyam, na\nsahasraya na ayutaya va _g_ ri-va _h_ na _s_ ata\xc2\xb4ya _s_ ata-magha.\n\nI should not give thee up, wielder of the thunderbolt, even for a great price,\nnot for a thousand, not for ten thousand (?), not for a hundred, O Indra, thou\nwho art possessed of a hundred powers!\n\nVIII, 51, 7. kada\xc2\xb4 _k_ ana stari\xc2\xb4 _h_ asi.\n\nThou art never sterile.\n\nVIII, 52, 7. kada\xc2\xb4 _k_ ana pra yu _k_ _kh_ asi.\n\nThou art never weary.\n\nVIII, 55, 5. _k_ akshusha _k_ ana sam-na _s_ e.\n\nNot to be reached even with eye.\n\nX, 56, 4. mahimna _h_ esham pitara _h_ _k_ ana i _s_ ire.\n\nNote 6. Considering the particular circumstances mentioned in this and the\npreceding hymn, of Indra\'s forsaking his companions, the Maruts, or even\nscorning their help, one feels strongly tempted to take tya _g_ as in its\netymological sense of leaving or forsaking, and to translate, by his forsaking\nyou, or, if he should forsake you. The poet may have meant the word to convey\nthat idea, which no doubt would be most appropriate here; but it must be\nconfessed, at the same time, that in other passages where tya _g_ as occurs,\nthat meaning could hardly be ascribed to it. Strange as it may seem, no one\nwho is acquainted with the general\n\np. 268\n\ntrain of thought in the Vedic hymns can fail to see that tya _g_ as in most\npassages means attack, onslaught; it may be even the instrument of an attack,\na weapon. How it should come to take this meaning is indeed difficult to\nexplain, and I do not wonder that Professor Roth in his Dictionary simply\nrenders the word by forlornness, need, danger, or by estrangement, unkindness,\nmalignity. But let us look at the passages. and we shall see that these\nabstract conceptions are quite out of place:\n\nVIII, 47, 7. na tam tigmam _k_ ana tya _g_ a _h_ na drasad abhi tam guru.\n\nNo sharp blow, no heavy one, shall come near him whom you protect.\n\nHere the two adjectives tigma, sharp, and guru, heavy, point to something\ntangible, and I feel much inclined, to take tya _g_ as in this passage as a\nweapon, as something that is let off with violence, rather than in the more\nabstract sense of onslaught.\n\nI, 169, 1. maha _h_ _k_ it asi tya _g_ asa _h_ varuta\xc2\xb4.\n\nThou art the shielder from a great attack.\n\nIV, 43, 4. ka _h_ vam maha _h_ _k_ it tya _g_ asa _h_ abhi\xc2\xb4ke urushyatam\nmadhvi dasra na _h_ uti\xc2\xb4.\n\nWho is against your great attack? Protect us with your help, O A _s_ vins, ye\nstrong ones.\n\nHere Professor Roth seems to join maha _h_ _k_ it tya _g_ asa _h_ abhi\xc2\xb4ke\nurushyatam, but in that case it would be impossible to construe the first\nwords, ka _h_ vam.\n\nI, 119, 8. aga _k_ _kh_ atam k _r i_pama _n_ am para-vati pitu _h_ svasya tya\n_g_ asa ni-badhitam.\n\nYou went from afar to the suppliant, who had been struck down by the violence\nof his own father.\n\nAccording to Professor Roth tya _g_ as would here mean forlornness, need, or\ndanger. But nibadhita is a strong verb, as we may see in\n\nVIII, 64, 2. pada\xc2\xb4 pa _n_ i\xc2\xb4n aradhasa _h_ ni badhasva maha\xc2\xb4n asi.\n\nStrike the useless Pa _n_ is down with thy foot, for thou art great.\n\nX, 18, 11. ut _s_ va _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ asva p _ri_ thivi ma\xc2\xb4 ni badhatha _h_.\n\nOpen, O earth, do not press on him (i. e. the dead, who is\n\np. 269\n\nto be buried; cf. M. M., \xc3\x9cber Todtenbestattung, Zeitschrift der D. M. G., vol.\nix, p. xv).\n\nVII, 83, 6. yatra ra\xc2\xb4 _g_ a-bhi _h_ da _s_ a-bhi _h_ ni-badhitam pra su-da\xc2\xb4sam\na\xc2\xb4vatam t _r i_tsu-bhi _h_ saha.\n\nWhere you protected Sudas with the T _ri_ tsus, when he was pressed or set\nupon by the ten kings.\n\nAnother passage in which tya _g_ as occurs is,\n\nVI, 62, 10. sanutyena tya _g_ asa martyasya vanushyata\xc2\xb4m api _s_ irsha\xc2\xb4 vav\n_ri_ ktam.\n\nBy your covert attack turn back the heads of those even who harass the mortal.\n\nThough this passage may seem less decisive, yet it is difficult to see how tya\n_g_ asa could here, according to Professor Roth, be rendered by forlornness or\ndanger. Something is required by which enemies can be turned back. Nor can it\nbe doubtful that _s_ irsha\xc2\xb4 is governed by vav _ri_ ktam, meaning turn back\ntheir heads, for the same expression occurs again in I, 33, 5. para _k_ it _s_\nirsha\xc2\xb4 vav _ri_ _g_ u _h_ te indra aya _g_ vana _h_ ya _g_ va-bhi _h_\nspardhamana _h_.\n\nProfessor Ben fey translates this verse by, \'Kopfuber flohn sie alle vor dir;\'\nbut it may be rendered more literally, \'These lawless people fighting with the\npious turned away their heads.\'\n\nX, 144, 6. eva tat indra _h_ induna deveshu _k_ it dharayate mahi tya _g_ a\n_h_.\n\nIndeed through this draught Indra can hold out against that great attack even\namong the gods.\n\nX, 79, 6. kim deveshu tya _g_ a _h_ ena _h_ _k_ akartha.\n\nWhat insult, what sin hast thou committed among the gods?\n\nIn these two passages the meaning of tya _g_ as as attack or assault is at\nleast as appropriate as that proposed by Professor Roth, estrangement,\nmalignity.\n\nThere remains one passage, VI, 3, 1. yam tvam mitre _n_ a varu _n_ a _h_ sa-\n_g_ osha _h_ deva pa\xc2\xb4si tya _g_ asa martam a _m_ ha _h_.\n\nI confess that the construction of this verse is not clear to me, and I doubt\nwhether it is possible to use tya _g_ asa as a verbal noun governing an\naccusative. If this were possible, one might translate, \'The mortal whom thou,\nO God (Agni),\n\np. 270\n\n[paragraph continues] Varu _n_ a, together with Mitra, protectest by pushing\nback evil.\' More probably we should translate, \'Whom thou protectest from evil\nby thy might.\'\n\nIf it be asked how tya _g_ as can possibly have the meaning which has been\nassigned to it in all the passages in which it occurs; viz. that of forcibly\nattacking or pushing away, we can only account for it by supposing that tya\n_g_ , before it came to mean to leave, meant to push off, to drive away with\nviolence (verstossen instead of verlassen). This meaning may still be\nperceived occasionally in the use of tya _g_ ; e. g. devas tya _g_ antu mam,\nmay the gods forsake me! i. e. may the gods drive me away! Even in the latest\nSanskrit tya _g_ is used with regard to an arrow that is let off. \'To expel\'\nis expressed by nis-tya _g_. Those who believe in the production of new roots\nby the addition of prepositional prefixes might possibly see in tya _g_ an\noriginal ati-a _g_ , to drive off; but, however that may be, there is evidence\nenough to show that tya _g_ expressed originally a more violent act of\nseparation than it does in ordinary Sanskrit, though here, too, passages occur\nin which tya _g_ may be translated by to throw, to fling; for instance, khe\ndhuli _m_ yas tya _g_ ed u _k_ _k_ air murdhni tasyaiva sa patet, he who\nthrows up dust in the air, it will fall on his head. Ind. Spr. 1582.\n\nMu _k_ , too, is used in a similar manner; for instance, va _g_ ram mokshyate\nte mahendra _h_ , Mahabh. XIV, 263. Cf. Dhammapada, ver. 389.\n\n##### Verse 13.\n\nNote 1. _S_ a _m_ sa, masc., means a spell, whether for good or for evil, a\nblessing as well as a curse. It means a curse, or, at all events, a calumny:\n\nI, 18, 3. ma\xc2\xb4 na _h_ _s_ a _m_ sa _h_ ararusha _h_ dhurti _h_ pra _n_ ak\nmartyasya.\n\nLet not the curse of the enemy, the onslaught of a mortal hurt us.\n\nI, 94, 8. asma\xc2\xb4kam _s_ a _m_ sa _h_ abhi astu du _h_ -dhya\xcc\x83 _h_. May our curse\novercome the wicked!\n\nIII, 18, 2. tapa _s_ a _m_ sam ararusha _h_.\n\nBurn the curse of the enemy!\n\np. 271\n\nVII, 25, 2. are tam _s_ a _m_ sam k _ri_ _n_ uhi ninitso _h_.\n\nTake far away the curse of the reviler! Cf. VII, 34, 12.\n\nIt means blessing:\n\nII, 31, 6. uta ya _h_ _s_ a _m_ sam u _s_ i _g_ am-iva _s_ masi.\n\nWe desire your blessing as a blessing for suppliants.\n\nX, 31, 1. a\xc2\xb4 na _h_ deva\xc2\xb4nam upa vetu _s_ a _m_ sa _h_.\n\nMay the blessing of the gods come to us!\n\nX, 7, 1. urushya na _h_ uru-bhi _h_ deva _s_ a _m_ sai _h_.\n\nProtect us, god, with thy wide blessings!\n\nII, 23, 10. ma\xc2\xb4 na _h_ du _h_ - _s_ a _m_ sa _h_ abhi-dipsu _h_ i _s_ ata pra\nsu _s_ a _m_ sa _h_ mati-bhi _h_ tarishimahi.\n\nLet not an evil-speaking enemy conquer us; may we, enjoying good report,\nincrease by our. prayers!\n\nIn some passages, however, as pointed out by Grassmann, _s_ a _m_ sa may best\nbe rendered by singer, praiser. Grassmann marks one passage only,\n\nII, 26, 1. _ri_ _g_ u _h_ it _s_ a _m_ sa _h_ vanavat vanushyata _h_.\n\nMay the righteous singer conquer his enemies.\n\nHe admits, however, doubtfully, the explanation of B. R., that _ri_ _g_ u _h_\n_s_ a _m_ sa _h_ may be taken as one word, meaning, \'requiring the right.\'\nThis explanation seems surrendered by B. R. in the second edition of their\nDictionary, and I doubt whether _s_ a _m_ sa _h_ can mean here anything but\nsinger. That being so, the same meaning seems more appropriate in other verses\nalso, which I formerly translated differently, e. g.\n\nVII, 56, 19. ime _s_ a _m_ sam vanushyata _h_ ni panti.\n\nThey, the Maruts, protect the singer from his enemy.\n\nLastly, _s_ a _m_ sa means praise, the spell addressed by men to the gods, or\nprayer:\n\nI, 33, 7. pra sunvata _h_ stuvata _h_ _s_ a _m_ sam ava _h_.\n\nThou hast regarded the prayer of him who offers libation and praise.\n\nX, 42, 6. yasmin vayam dadhima _s_ a _m_ sam indre.\n\nIndra in whom we place our hope. Cf. a _s_ a _m_ s, Westergaard, Radices\nLinguae Sanscritae, s. v. _s_ a _m_ s.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[214:a](sbe3227.htm#fr_108) Schleicher, Compendium, \xc2\xa7 36, \xce\xb1\xe1\xbc\xb4\xce\xb8\xcf\x89, \xce\xb1\xe1\xbc\xb0\xce\xb8\xe1\xbd\xb5\xcf\x81,\n\xce\xb1\xe1\xbc\xb4\xce\xb8\xce\xbf\xcf\x85\xcf\x83\xce\xb1; and \xc2\xa7 49, aides, aidilis aestas.\n\n[215:a](sbe3227.htm#fr_109) \xc3\x81pa-tya; cf.

In Old Norse we have hanp-r, in A.\nS. haenep, hemp, Old High-Germ. hanaf.\n\nThe occurrence of the word _s_ a _n_ a is of importance as showing at how\nearly a time the Aryans of India were acquainted with the uses and the name of\nhemp. Our word hemp, the A. S. haenep, the Old Norse hanp-r, are all borrowed\nfrom Latin cannabis, which, like other borrowed words, has undergone the\nregular changes required by Grimm\'s law in Low-German, and also in High-\nGerman. hanaf. The Slavonic nations seem to have borrowed their word for hemp\n(Lith. kanape\xcc\x83) from the Goths, the Celtic nations (Ir. canaib) from the\nRomans (cf. Kuhn, Beitrage, vol. ii, p. 382). The Latin cannabis is borrowed\nfrom Greek, and the Greeks, to judge from the account of Herodotus, most\nlikely adopted the word from the Aryan Thracians and Scythians (Her. IV, 74;\nPictet, Les Aryens, vol. i, p. 314). \xce\x9a\xce\xac\xce\xbd\xce\xbd\xce\xb2\xce\xb9\xcf\x82 being a foreign word, it would be\nuseless to attempt an explanation of the final element bis, which is added to\n_s_ a _n_ a, the Sanskrit word for hemp. It may be visa, fibre, or it may be\nanything else. Certain it is that the main element in the name of hemp was the\nsame among the settlers in Northern India, and among the Thracians and\nScythians through whom the Greeks first became acquainted with hemp.\n\nThe history of the word \xce\xba\xce\xac\xce\xbd\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xb2\xce\xb9\xcf\x82 must be kept distinct from that of the Greek\n\xce\xba\xce\xac\xce\xbd\xce\xbd\xce\xb1 or \xce\xba\xce\xac\xce\xbd\xce\xb1, reed. Both spellings occur, for Pollux, X, 166, writes \xcf\x80\xcf\x84\xce\xb1\xce\xbd\xce\xac\xce\xba\xce\xb1\n\xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb3 \xe1\xbc\x90\xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xce\xb9 \xcf\x88\xce\xaf\xce\xb1\xce\xb8\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\xa1 \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xbd \xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\x96\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\x80\xce\xba\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xce\xaf\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xcf\x82 \xe1\xbc\xa3\xce\xbd \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xe1\xbd\xb6 \xce\xba\xce\xac\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xbd \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\xa6\xcf\x83\xce\xb9\xce\xbd, but VII, 176, \xce\xba\xce\xac\xce\xbd\xce\xbd\xce\xb1\xce\xb9\n\xce\xb4\xe1\xbd\xb2 \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb8 \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xba \xce\xba\xce\xb1\xce\xbd\xce\xac\xce\xb2\xcf\x89\xce\xbd \xcf\x80\xce\xbb\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xb3\xce\xbc\xce\xb1.
