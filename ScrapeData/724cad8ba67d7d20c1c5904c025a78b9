Ralph T.H. Griffith, [1899], at\nsacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 288\n\n### BOOK THE THIRTY-FIFTH.\n\nBEGONE the Panis, hence away, rebellious, scorners of the  \nGods!  \nThe place is his who poured the juice.  \n2 Let Savitar approve a spot upon the earth for thy remains:  \nAnd let the bulls be yoked for it.  \n3 Let Vayu purify. Let Savitar purify. With Agni's glitter.  \nWith Savitar's lustre. Let the bulls be unyoked.  \n4 The Holy Fig Tree is your home, your mansion is the Parna  \nTree:  \nWinners of cattle shall ye be if ye regain for me this man.  \n5 Let Savitar lay down thy bones committed to the Mother's  \nlap.  \nBe pleasant to this man, O Earth.  \n6 Here in the God Prajapati, near water, Man, I lay thee down:  \nMay his light drive mishap from us.  \n7 Go hence, O Death, pursue thy special pathway apart from  \nthat which Gods are wont to travel.  \nTo thee I say it who hast eyes and hearest: Touch not our  \noffspring, injure not our heroes.\n\np. 289\n\n8 Pleasant to thee be wind and sun, and pleasant be the bricks  \nto thee.  \nPleasant to thee be the terrestrial fires: let them not scorch  \nthee in their flames.  \n9 Prosper for thee the regions and the waters, and let the seas  \nfor thee be most propitious.  \nAuspicious unto thee be Air. Prosper all Quarters well for  \nthee!  \n10 On flows the stony flood: hold fast each other, keep yourselves  \nup, my friends, and pass the river.  \nHere let us leave the powers that brought no profit, and  \ncross the flood to Powers that are auspicious.  \n11 Drive away evil, drive away fault, sorcery, and guiltiness.  \nDo thou, O Apamarga, drive the evil dream away from us.  \n12 To us let waters and the plants be friendly, to him who  \nhates us, whom we hate, unfriendly.  \n13 For our prosperity we touch the ox the son of Surabhi.  \nBe bearer and deliverer to us as Indra to the Gods.  \n14 Looking upon the loftiest light, etc., as in XX. 21.  \n15 Here I erect this rampart for the living: let none of these,  \nnone other, reach this limit.  \nMay they survive a hundred lengthened autumns, and may  \nthey bury Death beneath this mountain.  \n16 Agni, thou pourest life, etc., as in XIX. 38.\n\np. 290\n\n17 Waxing with sacrifice live long, O Agni, with butter on thy  \nface and homed in fatness.  \nWhen thou hast drunk the cows\xc2\x92 fair savoury butter, guard,  \nas a father guards his son, these people.  \n18 These men have led about the ox, have duly carried Agni  \nround,  \nAnd raised their glory to the Gods. Who will attack them  \nwith success?  \n19 I drive Corpse-eating Agni to a distance: sin-laden let him  \ngo to Yama's kingdom.  \nHere let this other, Jatavedas, carry oblation to the Deities,  \nforeknowing.  \n20 Carry the fat to Fathers, Jatavedas, where, far away, thou  \nknowest, them established.  \nLet rivulets of marrow flow to meet them, and let their  \ntruthful wishes be accomplished. All-hail!  \n21 Pleasant be thou to us, O Earth, without a thorn, our  \nresting-place.  \nVouchsafe us shelter reaching far. May thy light drive  \nmishap from us.  \n22 Born art thou, Agni, from this man: let him again be born  \nfrom thee,  \nFor Svarga's world, the man I name. All-hail!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XXXVI](wyvbk36.htm)\n\n"
