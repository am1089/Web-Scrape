It is impossible here to lay\ndown general rules:--each scholar must be guided by his own sense of justice\nto others and by self-respect. Let us take one instance. From the first time\nthat I read the fourth hymn of the Rig-veda, I translated the fifth and sixth\nverses:\n\nuta bruvantu na _h_ nida _h_ ni _h_ anyata _h_ _k_ it arata,  \n  dadhana _h_ indre it duva _h_ ,  \nuta na _h_ su-bhagan ari _h_ vo _k_ eyu _h_ dasma k _ri_ sh _t_ aya _h_ ,  \n  sya\xc2\xb4ma it indrasya _s_ arma _n_ i.\n\n1\\. Whether our enemies say, 'Move away elsewhere, you who offer worship to\nIndra only,'--\n\n2\\. Or whether, O mighty one, all people call us blessed: may we always remain\nin the keeping of Indra.\n\nAbout the general sense of this passage I imagined there could be no doubt,\nalthough one word in it, viz. ari _h_ , required an explanation. Yet the\nvariety of interpretations proposed by different scholars is extraordinary.\nFirst, if we look to Saya _n_ a, he translates:\n\n1\\. May our priests praise Indra! O enemies, go away from this place, and also\nfrom another place! Our priests (may praise Indra), they who are always\nperforming worship for Indra.\n\n2\\. O destroyer of enemies! may the enemy call us possessed of wealth; how\nmuch more, friendly people! May we be in the happiness of Indra!\n\nProfessor Wilson did not follow Saya _n_ a closely, but translated:\n\n1\\. Let our ministers, earnestly performing his worship,\n\np. xl\n\nexclaim: Depart, ye revilers, from hence and every other place (where he is\nadored).\n\n2\\. Destroyer of foes, let our, enemies say we are prosperous: let men\n(congratulate us). May we ever abide in the felicity (derived from the favour)\nof Indra.\n\nLanglois translated:\n\n1\\. Que (ces amis), en fetant Indra, puissent dire: Vous, qui etes nos\nadversaires, retirez-vous loin d'ici.\n\n2\\. Que nos ennemis nous appellent des hommes fortunes, places que nous sommes\nsous la protection d'Indra. Stevenson translated:\n\n1\\. Let all men again join in praising Indra. Avaunt ye profane scoffers,\nremove from hence, and from every other place, while we perform the rites of\nIndra.\n\n2\\. O foe-destroyer, (through thy favour) even our enemies speak peaceably to\nus, the possessors of wealth; what wonder then if other men do so. Let us ever\nenjoy the happiness which springs from Indra's blessing.\n\nProfessor Benfey translated:\n\n1\\. And let the scoffers say, They are rejected by every one else, therefore\nthey celebrate Indra alone.\n\n2\\. And may the enemy and the country proclaim us as happy, O destroyer, if we\nare only in Indra's keeping a.\n\nProfessor Roth, s.v. anyata _h_ , took this word rightly in the sense of 'to a\ndifferent place,' and must therefore have taken that sentence 'move away\nelsewhere' in the same sense in which I take it. Later, however, s.v. ar, he\ncorrected himself, and proposed to translate the same words by 'you neglect\nsomething else.'\n\nProfessor Bollensen (Orient und Occident, vol. ii, p. 462),\n\np. xli\n\nadopting to a certain extent the second rendering of Professor Roth in\npreference to that of Professor Benfey, endeavoured to show that the\n'something else which is neglected,' is not something indefinite, but the\nworship of all the other gods, except Indra.\n\nIt might, no doubt, be said that every one of these translations contains\nsomething that is right, though mixed up with a great deal that is wrong; but\nto attempt for every verse of the Veda to quote and to criticise every\nprevious translation, would be an invidious and useless task. In the case just\nquoted, it might seem right to state that Professor Bollensen was the first to\nsee that ari _h_ should be joined with k _ri_ sh _t_ aya _h_ , and that he\ntherefore proposed to alter it to ari _h_ , as a nom. plur. But on referring\nto Rosen, I find that, to a certain extent, he had anticipated Professor\nBollensen's remark, for though, in his cautious way, he abstained from\naltering the text, yet he remarked: Possitne ari _h_ pluralis esse, contracta\nterminatione, pro araya _h_?\n\n\n\nAfter these preliminary remarks I have to say a few Plan of the work.words on\nthe general plan of my translation.\n\nI do not attempt as yet a translation of the whole of the Rig-veda, and I\ntherefore considered myself at liberty to group the hymns according to the\ndeities to which they are addressed. By this process, I believe, a great\nadvantage is gained. We see at one glance all that has been said of a certain\ngod, and we gain a more complete insight into his nature and character.\nSomething of the same kind had been attempted by the original collectors of\nthe ten books, for it can hardly be by accident that each of them begins with\nhymns addressed to Agni, and that these are followed by hymns addressed to\nIndra. The only exception to this rule is the eighth Ma _n_ _d_ ala, for the\nninth being devoted to one deity, to Soma, can hardly be accounted an\nexception. But if we take the Rig-veda as a whole, we find hymns, addressed to\nthe same deities, not only scattered about in different books, but not even\ngrouped together when they occur in one and the same book. Here, as we lose\nnothing by giving up the old arrangement, we\n\np. xlii\n\nare surely at liberty, for our own purposes, to put together such hymns as\nhave a common object, and to place before the reader as much material as\npossible for an exhaustive study of each individual deity.\n\nI give for each hymn the Sanskrit original a in what is known as the Pada\ntext, i. e. the text in which all words (pada) stand by themselves, as they do\nin Greek or Latin, without being joined together according to the rules of\nSandhi. The text in which the words are thus joined, as they are in all other\nSanskrit texts, is called the Sa _m_ hita text. Whether the Pada or the Sa _m_\nhita text be the more ancient, may seem difficult to settle. As far as I can\njudge, they seem to me, in their present form, the product of the same period\nof Vedic scholarship. The Prati _s_ akhyas, it is true, start from the Pada\ntext, take it, as it were, for granted, and devote their rules to the\nexplanation of those changes which that text undergoes in being changed into\nthe Sa _m_ hita text. But, on the other hand, the Pada text in some cases\nclearly presupposes the Sa _m_ hita text. It leaves out passages which are\nrepeated more than once, while the Sa _m_ hita text always repeats these\npassages; it abstains from dividing the termination of the locative plural su,\nwhenever in the Sa _m_ hita text, i. e. according to the rules of Sandhi, it\nbecomes shu; hence nadishu, a _g_ ishu, but ap-su; and it gives short vowels\ninstead of the long ones of the Sa _m_ hita, even in cases where the long\nvowels are justified by the rules of the Vedic language. It is certain, in\nfact, that neither the Pada nor the Sa _m_ hita text, as we now possess them,\nrepresents the original text of the Veda. Both show clear traces of scholastic\ninfluences. But if we try to restore the original form of the Vedic hymns, we\nshall certainly arrive at some kind of Pada text rather than at a Sa _m_ hita\ntext; nay, even in their present form, the original metre and rhythm of the\nancient hymns of the _Ri_ shis are far more perceptible when the words are\ndivided, than when we join them together throughout according to the rules of\nSandhi. Lastly, for practical purposes, the Pada text is far superior to the\nSa _m_ hita text in which the final\n\np. xliii\n\nand initial letters, that is, the most important letters of words, are\nconstantly disguised, and liable therefore to different interpretations.\nAlthough in some passages we may differ from the interpretation adopted by the\nPada text, and although certain Vedic words have, no doubt, been wrongly\nanalysed and divided by _S_ akalya, yet such cases are comparatively few, and\nwhere they occur, they are interesting as carrying us back to the earliest\nattempts of Vedic scholarship. In the vast majority of cases the divided text,\nwith a few such rules as we have to observe in reading Latin, nay, even in\nreading Pali verses, brings us certainly much nearer to the original utterance\nof the ancient _Ri_ shis than the amalgamated text.\n\nThe critical principles by which I have been guided in editing for the first\ntime the text of the Rig-veda, require Principles of criticism.a few words of\nexplanation, as they have lately been challenged on grounds which, I think,\nrest on a complete misapprehension of my previous statements on this subject.\n\nAs far as we are able to judge at present, we can hardly speak of various\nreadings in the Vedic hymns, in the usual sense of that word. Various readings\nto be gathered from a collation of different MSS., now accessible to us, there\nare none. After collating a considerable number of MSS., I have succeeded, I\nbelieve, in fixing on three representative MSS., as described in the preface\nto the first volume of my edition of the Rig-veda. Even these MSS. are not\nfree from blunders,--for what MS. is?--but these blunders have no claim to the\ntitle of various readings. They are lapsus calami, and no more; and, what is\nimportant, they have not become traditional a.\n\np. xliv\n\nThe text, as deduced from the best MSS. of the Sa _m_ hita text, can be\ncontrolled by four independent checks. The first is, of course, a collation of\nthe best MSS. of the Sa _m_ hita text.\n\nThe second check to be applied to the Sa _m_ hita text is a comparison with\nthe Pada text, of which, again, I possessed at least one excellent MS., and\nseveral more modern copies.\n\nThe third check was a comparison of this text with Saya _n_ a's commentary, or\nrather with the text which is presupposed by that commentary. In the few cases\nwhere the Pada text seemed to differ from the Sa _m_ hita text, a note was\nadded to that effect, in the various readings of my edition; and the same was\ndone, at least in all important cases, where Saya _n_ a clearly followed a\ntext at variance with our own.\n\nThe fourth check was a comparison of any doubtful passage with the numerous\npassages quoted in the Prati _s_ akhya.\n\nThese were the principles by which I was guided in the critical restoration of\nthe text of the Rig-veda, and I believe I may say that the text as printed by\nme is more correct than any MS. now accessible, more trustworthy than the text\nfollowed by Saya _n_ a, and in all important points identically the same with\nthat text which the authors of the\n\np. xlv\n\n[paragraph continues] Prati _s_ akhya followed in their critical researches in\nthe fifth or sixth century before our era. I believe that starting from that\ndate our text of the Veda is better authenticated, and supported by a more\nperfect apparatus criticus, than the text of any Greek or Latin author, and I\ndo not think that diplomatic criticism can ever go beyond what has been\nachieved in the constitution of the text of the Vedic hymns.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xl:a](sbe3204.htm#fr_16) I add Grassmann's and Ludwig's renderings:\n\nGrassmann:\n\nMag spottend sagen unser Feind:  \nKein Andrer kummert sich um sie;  \nDrum feiern Indra sie allein.'  \nUnd glucklich mogen, Machtiger!  \nDie Freundesstamme nennen uns,  \nNur wenn wir sind in Indra's Schutz.\n\nLudwig: Mogen unsere tadler sagen: sogar noch anderes entgeht euch (dabei),\nwenn ihr dienst dem Indra tut.\n\nOder moge uns gluckselige nennen der fromme, so nennen, o wundertater, die\n(funf) volker, in Indra's schutze mogen wir sein.\n\n[xlii:a](sbe3204.htm#fr_17) This is left out in the second edition.\n\n[xliii:a](sbe3204.htm#fr_18) Thus X, 101, 2, one of the Pada MSS. (P 2) reads\ndistinctly ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ am pra k _ri_ _n_ uta sakhaya _h_ , but all the other\nMSS. have nayata, and there can be little doubt that it was the frequent\nrepetition of the verb k _ri_ in this verse which led the writer to substitute\nk _ri_ _n_ uta for nayata. No other MS., as far as I am aware, repeats this\nblunder. In IX, 86, 34, the writer of the same MS. puts ra _g_ asi instead of\ndhavasi, because his eye was caught by ra _g_ a in the preceding line. X, 16,\n5, the same MS. reads sa _m_ ga _k_ _kh_ asva instead of ga _k_ _kh_ atam,\nwhich is supported by S 1, S 2, P 1, while S 3 has a peculiar and more\nimportant reading, ga _k_ _kh_ atat. X, 67, 6, the same MS. P 2 has vi _k_\nakartha instead of vi _k_ akarta.\n\nA number of various readings which have been gleaned from Pandit Taranatha's\np. xliv Tuladanadipaddhati (see Trubner's American and Oriental Literary\nRecord, July 31, 1868) belong to the same class. They may be due either to the\ncopyists of the MSS. which Pandit Taranatha used while compiling his work, or\nthey may by accident have crept into his own MS. Anyhow, not one of them is\nsupported either by the best MSS. accessible in Europe, or by any passage in\nthe Prati _s_ akhya.\n\nRV.\n\n|\n\nIX,\n\n|\n\n11,\n\n|\n\n2,\n\n|\n\nread\n\n|\n\ndevayu\n\n|\n\ninstead of\n\n|\n\ndevayu _h_  b.  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nIX,\n\n|\n\n11,\n\n|\n\n4,\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nar _k_ ata\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nar _k_ ate b.  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nIX.\n\n|\n\n14,\n\n|\n\n2,\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nyadi sabandhava _h_\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nyaddiptabandhava _h_  b.  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nIX\n\n|\n\n16,\n\n|\n\n3,\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nanaptam\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nanuptam b.  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nIX,\n\n|\n\n17,\n\n|\n\n2,\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nsuvanasa\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nstuvanasa b.  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nIX,\n\n|\n\n21,\n\n|\n\n2,\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nprav _ri_ _n_ vanto\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nprav _ri_ _n_ vato b.  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nIX,\n\n|\n\n48,\n\n|\n\n2,\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nsa _m_ v _ri_ kta\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nsa _m_ yukta b.  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nIX,\n\n|\n\n49,\n\n|\n\n1\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nno\xe0\xa4\xbdpam\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nno yam b.  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nIX,\n\n|\n\n54,\n\n|\n\n3,\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nsurya _h_\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nsuryam b.  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nIX,\n\n|\n\n59,\n\n|\n\n3,\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nsida ni\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n|\n\nsidati b.  \n  \n[xliii:b](sbe3204.htm#fr_28) As printed by Pandit Taranatha.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Part 3](sbe3205.htm)\n\n"
