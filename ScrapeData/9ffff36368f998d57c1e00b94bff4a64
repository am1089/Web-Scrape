This wheel of life, which is associated with the pairs of opposites,\nand which is devoid of consciousness, all the world, together with the\nimmortals should cast away, abridge, and check 9. That man: among all\ncreatures, who always\n\np. 358\n\naccurately understands the movement and stoppage 1 of the wheel of life is\nnever deluded. (That) sage, released from all impressions 2, transcending all\npairs of opposites, and released from all sins, attains the highest goal. The\nhouseholder, and the Brahma _k_ arin, the forester, and also the beggar 3, all\nthese four orders are stated to have the order of householder for their basis.\nWhatever system of rules 4 is prescribed in this world, to follow it is good;\nthis has been celebrated from ancient times 5. He who has been first refined\nby ceremonies 6, and who has duly observed vows, being (born) in a caste of\n(high) qualifications 7, and who understands the Vedas, should return 8 (from\nhis preceptor's house). Always devoted to his own wife, behaving like 9 good\nmen, with his senses restrained, and full of faith, one should perform the\nfive sacrifices 10 in this world. The sage who eats what remains after\n(offerings) to deities 11 and guests, who is devoted to Vedic rites, who duly\nperforms sacrifices and\n\np. 359\n\ngifts according to his means, who is not thoughtlessly active 1 with the hand\nor foot, who is not thoughtlessly active with the eye, and who is not\nthoughtlessly active with his speech or any of his limbs, to such a one the\n(word) good applies. One should always have the sacred thread and a clean\ncloth, and be of pure vows, and self-restrained, and should always associate\nwith good men, making gifts, and with one's external organs restrained; one\nshould restrain one's lust and hunger 2, should be kind, should behave like\nthe good, and keep a bamboo stick and a water-pot filled with water 3. One\nshould learn and teach, should likewise perform sacrifices and officiate at\nothers' sacrifices, and should give and receive gifts,--(thus) one should\nadopt the sixfold mode of life 4. Know that three (of these) duties are the\nmeans of livelihood for Brahma _n_ as, the two teaching and officiating at\nsacrifices, and also receiving untainted gifts 5. And as to the other\nremaining three duties, gift, study, and sacrifice, they are pious 6 duties.\nWith regard to those three duties, the sage who understands piety, who is\nself-restrained, kind, possessed of forgiveness, and equable to all creatures,\nshould avoid heedlessness 7. The\n\np. 360\n\nBrahmana householder, who is of rigid vows, who is thus devoted, discharging\nall these duties as much as is in his power, conquers heaven.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[355:1](sbe0856.htm#fr_1778) Cf. Gita, [p. 45](sbe0804.htm#page_45).\n\n[355:2](sbe0856.htm#fr_1779) All this is action, the fruit of which is\nperishable; the fruit of knowledge, on the other hand, is everlasting.\n\n[355:3](sbe0857.htm#fr_1780) Literally, time; it seems, however, to stand for\nthe vicissitudes of worldly life. Cf. _S_ veta _s_ vatara, p. 283. The body is\ncalled 'wheel of time' at [p. 53](sbe0805.htm#page_53) supra, but Ar _g_ una\nMi _s_ ra there says 'it is the wheel which causes the rotation of the wheel\nof time.'\n\n[355:4](sbe0857.htm#fr_1781) The cause of its being large in dimensions, Ar\n_g_ una Mi _s_ ra; the supporting pillar, Nilaka _nth_ a. I prefer the former,\nand take the sense to be that worldly life is co-extensive with the operations\nor 'fancies' of the mind.\n\n[355:5](sbe0857.htm#fr_1782) What is outside the elements, the physical\nmanifestations of Prak _ri_ ti, is beyond the domain of worldly life.\n\n[355:6](sbe0857.htm#fr_1783) The possession of 'home' is equivalent to a\ndwelling in the midst of worldly life. Hence the idea of homelessness at inter\nalia Gita, pp. [101](sbe0814.htm#page_101)-[103](sbe0815.htm#page_103).\n\n[356:1](sbe0857.htm#fr_1784) This means, I presume, that worldly life is\nconditioned, so to say, by space and time. See [p. 343](sbe0854.htm#page_343)\nsupra.\n\n[356:2](sbe0857.htm#fr_1785) I. e. the cause of the rotation, Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[356:3](sbe0857.htm#fr_1786) I. e. unintelligent.\n\n[356:4](sbe0857.htm#fr_1787) Now takes the form of a man, now of an animal,\nand then of some other thing, Nilaka _nth_ a. I think, however, that the\nmeaning is, that it is not alike to all; different persons are in different\nstates in this world.\n\n[356:5](sbe0857.htm#fr_1788) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says this means that it is\nthe cause of the movements in all the worlds. That is the sense I extract from\nhis words, which are not quite clear, lokanam sam _k_ ara _n_ e hetus. The\nrendering in the text follows Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[356:6](sbe0857.htm#fr_1789) I. e., I presume, that which retards the\nrevolutions of the 'wheel.' Instead of 'penance,' Nilaka _nth_ a's reading is\n'the, quality of darkness.'\n\n[356:7](sbe0857.htm#fr_1790) Cf. Sa _n_ khya-karika, p. 13, and Vakaspati's\ncommentary thereon.\n\n[356:8](sbe0857.htm#fr_1791) 'Animated,' Nilaka _nth_ a. Egoism is the cause\nof the world, and of all knowledge of it. Cf. Sa _n_ khya-karika, p. 24.\n\n[356:9](sbe0857.htm#fr_1792) The text here is unsatisfactory. I follow Nilaka\n_nth_ a, who says 'vexations = those arising from not obtaining what is\ndesired.'\n\n[357:1](sbe0857.htm#fr_1793) Revolves in the midst of, = lives upon, is fed\nby, Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[357:2](sbe0857.htm#fr_1794) I. e. the organs of action, I presume.\n\n[357:3](sbe0857.htm#fr_1795) The more attachments one has, the more one is\ntied down to worldly life, and the more comprehensive such life becomes.\n\n[357:4](sbe0857.htm#fr_1796) Avarice is coveting another's wealth when one has\none's own; desire is the wish for that which one has not.\n\n[357:5](sbe0857.htm#fr_1797) Nilaka _nth_ a reads 'vi _k_ itra,' which he\nrenders to mean diversified, as being made up of the three qualities,\nignorance there being the same thing as Prak _ri_ ti, which is probably a\nbetter sense altogether than that obtainable from Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra's\nreading.\n\n[357:6](sbe0857.htm#fr_1798) Which moves by attachment to eternal pleasures,\n&c., Nilaka _nth_ a. See [p. 300](sbe0842.htm#page_300) supra.\n\n[357:7](sbe0857.htm#fr_1799) I. e. all the world developed from Prakriti--a\ncommon phrase.\n\n[357:8](sbe0857.htm#fr_1800) This is Nilaka _nth_ a's forced meaning. But the\ntext here is doubtful. Perhaps the sense is 'in which production and\ndissolution are going on unchecked.'\n\n[357:9](sbe0857.htm#fr_1801) See [p. 344](sbe0854.htm#page_344) note. For the\nlast word, the variant here is sthapayet, make steady or stop.\n\n[358:1](sbe0857.htm#fr_1802) I. e. the causes of the revolution and stoppage,\nNilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[358:2](sbe0857.htm#fr_1803) Impressions of previous actions, delusions, &c.\nAnd see [p. 247](sbe0831.htm#page_247) supra.\n\n[358:3](sbe0857.htm#fr_1804) I. e. the Samnyasin.\n\n[358:4](sbe0857.htm#fr_1805) _S_ astra. Cf. Gita, [p.\n117](sbe0818.htm#page_117).\n\n[358:5](sbe0857.htm#fr_1806) 'Such is the eternal fame,' literally.\n\n[358:6](sbe0857.htm#fr_1807) I. e. on whom the Vedic rites or Sa _m_ skaras\nare duly performed. And see Gita, [p. 122](sbe0820.htm#page_122).\n\n[358:7](sbe0857.htm#fr_1808) I. e. one of the three higher castes.\n\n[358:8](sbe0857.htm#fr_1809) The original is the technical word for the return\nof a Brahma _k_ arin after finishing his studies. He is describing the\n'householder.'\n\n[358:9](sbe0857.htm#fr_1810) I. e. following the rule of conduct sanctioned by\nthe good.\n\n[358:10](sbe0857.htm#fr_1811) Vide Williams' Dictionary, s.v. mahaya _g_ \xc3\xb1a; \xc3\x82\n_s_ valayana G _ri_ hya III, 1, 3; Manu II, 69; IV, 21.\n\n[358:11](sbe0857.htm#fr_1812) Cf. Gita, [p. 62](sbe0806.htm#page_62); a guest\nmust always be fed, and unless he is satisfied the host must not eat. Cf. _S_\nanti Parvan (Moksha), chap. 192, st. 15; Manu III, 106; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 3, 7, 3.\n\n[359:1](sbe0857.htm#fr_1813) The same word as at Gita, [p.\n114](sbe0817.htm#page_114), there rendered 'vain activity.'\n\n[359:2](sbe0857.htm#fr_1814) Cf. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 1, 1, 2 seq.\n\n[359:3](sbe0857.htm#fr_1815) Cf. Manu IV, 36; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 1, 1, 15.\n\n[359:4](sbe0857.htm#fr_1816) These are the well-known six duties of Brahma _n_\nas as specified by Manu and others. See the discussion of this point in the\nIntroduction.\n\n[359:5](sbe0857.htm#fr_1817) Another reading is 'gifts from an untainted\n(source).'\n\n[359:6](sbe0857.htm#fr_1818) What is the exact meaning of this here? I suppose\nthe meaning is that the performance of them is a pure performance of duty; the\nothers are duties the performance of which supplies ones own wants, and is\ntherefore interested. Cf. Gautama X, 1 and 2.\n\n[359:7](sbe0857.htm#fr_1819) I. e. omission or mistake in performance.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXI](sbe0858.htm)\n\n"
