If a man\'s wants can be removed for an hour, it is\nhelping him indeed; if his wants can be removed for a year it will be more\nhelp to him; but if his wants can be removed for ever, it is surely the\ngreatest help that can be given him. Spiritual knowledge is the only thing\nthat can destroy our miseries for ever; any other knowledge satisfies wants\nonly for a time. It is only With the knowledge of the spirit that the faculty\nof want is annihilated for ever; so helping man spiritually is the highest\nhelp that can be given to him; he who gives man spiritual knowledge is the\ngreatest benefactor of mankind, and as such we always find that those were the\nmost powerful of men who helped man in his spiritual needs; because\nspirituality is the true basis of all our activities in life. A spiritually\nstrong and sound man will be strong in every other respect, if he so wishes;\nuntil there is spiritual strength in man even physical needs cannot be well\nsatisfied. Next to spiritual comes intellectual help; the gift of knowledge is\na far higher gift than that of food and clothes; it is even higher than giving\nlife to a man, because the real life of man consists of knowledge; ignorance\nis death, knowledge is life. Life is of very little value, if it is a life in\nthe dark, groping through ignorance and misery. Next in order comes, of\ncourse, helping a man physically. Therefore, in considering the question of\nhelping others. We must always strive not to commit the mistake of thinking\nthat physical help is the only help that can be given,\n\np. 51\n\nit is not only the last but the least, because it cannot bring about permanent\nsatisfaction. The misery that I feel when I am hungry is satisfied by eating,\nbut hunger returns; my misery can cease only when I am satisfied beyond all\nwant. Then hunger will not make me miserable; no distress, no sorrow will be\nable to move me. So that help which tends to make us strong spiritually is the\nhighest, next to it comes intellectual help, and after that physical help.\n\nThe miseries of the world cannot be cured by physical help only; until man\'s\nnature changes, these physical needs will always arise, and miseries will\nalways be felt, and no amount of physical help will cure them completely. The\nonly solution of this problem is to make mankind pure. Ignorance is the mother\nof all the evil and all the misery we see. Let men have light, let them be\npure and spiritually strong and educated, then alone will misery cease in the\nworld, not before. We may convert every house in the country into a charity\nasylum; we may fill the land with hospitals, but the misery of man will still\ncontinue to exist until man\'s character changes.\n\nWe read in the _Bhagavad-Gita_ again and again that we must all work\nincessantly. All work is by nature composed of good and evil. We cannot do any\nwork which will not do some good somewhere; there cannot be any work which\nwill not cause some harm somewhere. Every work must necessarily be a mixture\nof good and evil; yet we are commanded to work incessantly. Good and evil will\nboth have their results, will produce their _Karma_. Good action will entail\nupon us good effect; bad action, bad. But good and bad are both bondages of\nthe soul. The solution reached in the _Gita_ in regard to this bondage-\nproducing nature of work is, that if we do not attach ourselves to the work we\ndo, it will not have any binding effect on our soul. We shall try to\nunderstand what is meant by this "non-attachment" to work.\n\nThis is the one central idea in the _Gita;_ work\n\np. 52\n\nincessantly, but be not attached to it. " _Samskara_ " can be translated very\nnearly by inherent tendency. Using the simile of a lake for the mind, every\nripple, every wave that rises in the mind, when it subsides, does not die out\nentirely, but leaves a mark and a future possibility of that wave coming out\nagain. This mark, with the possibility of the wave reappearing, is what is\ncalled _Samskara_. Every work that we do, every movement of the body, every\nthought that we think, leaves such an impression on the mind-stuff, and even\nwhen such impressions are not obvious on the surface they are sufficiently\nstrong to work beneath the surface, subconsciously. What we are every moment\nis determined by the sum-total of these impressions on the mind. What I am\njust at this moment is the effect of the sum-total of all the impressions of\nmy past life. This is really what is meant by character; each man\'s character\nis determined by the sum-total of these impressions. If good impressions\nprevail, the character becomes good; if bad, it becomes bad. If a man\ncontinuously hears bad words, thinks bad thoughts, does bad actions, his mind\nwill be full of bad impressions; and they will influence his thought and work\nwithout his being conscious of the fact. In fact, these bad impressions are\nalways working, and their resultant must be evil; and that man will be a bad\nman; he cannot help it; the sum-total of these impressions in him will create\nthe strong motive power for doing bad actions; he will be like a machine in\nthe hands of his impressions, and they will force him to do evil. Similarly,\nif a man thinks good thoughts and does good works, the sum-total of these\nimpressions will be good; and they, in a similar manner, will force him to do\ngood even in spite of himself. When a man has done so much good work and\nthought so many good thoughts that there is an irresistible tendency in him to\ndo good, in spite of himself and even if he wishes to do evil, his mind, as\nthe sum-total of his tendencies,\n\np. 53\n\nwill not allow him to do so; the tendencies will turn him back; he is\ncompletely under the influence of the good tendencies. When such is the case,\na man\'s good character is said to be established.\n\nAs the tortoise tucks its feet and head inside the shell, and you may kill it\nand break it in pieces, and yet it will not come out, even so the character of\nthat man who has control over his motives and organs is unchangeably\nestablished. He controls his own inner forces, and nothing can draw them out\nagainst his will. By this continuous reflex of good thoughts, good impressions\nmoving over the surface of the mind, the tendency for doing good becomes\nstrong, and as the result we feel able to control the _indriyas_ (the sense-\norgans, the nerve centres). Thus alone will character be established; then\nalone a man gets to truth; such a man is safe for ever; he cannot do any evil;\nyou may place him in any company; there will be no danger for him. There is a\nstill higher state than having this good tendency, and that is the desire for\nliberation. You must remember that freedom of the soul is the goal of all\n_Yogas_ , and each one equally leads to the same result. By work alone men may\nget to where Buddha got largely by meditation or Christ by prayer. Buddha was\na working _Jnani;_ Christ was a _Bhakta_ , but the same goal was reached by\nboth of them. The difficulty is here. Liberation means entire freedom--freedom\nfrom the bondage of good, as well as from the bondage of evil. A golden chain\nis as much a chain as an iron one. There is a thorn in my finger, and I use\nanother to take the first one out, and when I have taken it out I throw both\nof them aside; I have no necessity for keeping the second thorn, because both\nare thorns after all. So the bad tendencies are to be counteracted by the good\nones, and the bad impressions on the mind should be removed by the fresh waves\nof good ones, until all that is evil almost disappears, or is subdued and held\nin control in\n\np. 54\n\na corner of the mind; but after that, the good tendencies have also to be\nconquered. Thus the "attached" becomes the "unattached." Work, but let not the\naction or the thought produce a deep impression on the mind; let the ripples\ncome and go; let huge actions proceed from the muscles and the brain, but let\nthem not make any deep impression on the soul.\n\nHow can this be done? We see that the impression of any action to which we\nattach ourselves, remains. I may meet hundreds of persons during the day, and\namong them meet also one whom I love; and when I retire at night I may try to\nthink of all the faces I saw, but only that face comes before the mind--the\nface which I met perhaps only for one minute, and which I loved; all the\nothers have vanished. My attachment to this particular person caused a deeper\nimpression on my mind than all the other faces. Physiologically, the\nimpressions have all been the same; every one of the faces that I saw pictured\nitself on the retina, and the brain took the pictures in, and yet there was no\nsimilarity of effect upon the mind. Most of the faces, perhaps, were entirely\nnew faces, about which I had never thought before, but that one face of which\nI got only a glimpse, found associations inside. Perhaps I had pictured him in\nmy mind for years, knew hundreds of things about him, and this one new vision\nof him awakened hundreds of sleeping memories in my mind; and this one\nimpression having been repeated perhaps a hundred times more than those of the\ndifferent faces together, will produce a great effect on the mind.\n\nTherefore, be "unattached;" let things work; let brain centres work; work\nincessantly, but let not a ripple conquer the mind. Work as if you were a\nstranger in this land, a sojourner; work incessantly, but do not bind\nyourselves; bondage is terrible. This world is not our habitation, it is only\none of the many stages through which\n\np. 55\n\nwe are passing. Remember that great saying of the _Sankhya_ , "The whole of\nnature is for the soul, not the soul for nature." The very reason of nature\'s\nexistence is for the education of the soul; it has no other meaning; it is\nthere because the soul must have knowledge, and through knowledge free itself.\nIf we remember this always, we shall never be attached to nature; we shall\nknow that nature is a book in which we are to read, and that when we have\ngained the required knowledge the book is of no more value to us. Instead of\nthat, however, we are identifying ourselves with nature; we are thinking that\nthe soul is for nature, that the spirit is for the flesh. and, as the common\nsaying has it, we think that man "lives to eat" and not "eats to live," we are\ncontinually making this mistake; we are regarding nature as ourselves and are\nbecoming attached to it; and as soon as this attachment comes, there is the\ndeep impression on the soul, which binds us down and makes us work not from\nfreedom but like slaves.\n\nThe whole gist of this teaching is that you should work like a _master_ and\nnot as a _slave;_ work incessantly, but do not do slave\'s work. Do you not see\nhow everybody works? Nobody can be altogether at rest; ninety-nine per cent.\nof mankind work like slaves, and the result is misery; it is all selfish work.\nWork through freedom! Work through love! The word \'love\' is very difficult to\nunderstand; love never comes until there is freedom. There is no true love\npossible in the slave. If you buy a slave and tie him down in chains and make\nhim work for you, he will work like a drudge, but there will be no love in\nhim. So when we ourselves work for the things of the world as slaves, there\ncan be no love in us, and our work is not true work. This is true of work done\nfor relatives and friends, and is true of work done for our own selves.\nSelfish work is slave\'s work; and here is a test. Every act of love brings\nhappiness; there is no act\n\np. 56\n\nof love which does not bring peace and blessedness as its reaction. Real\nexistence, real knowledge, and real love are eternally connected with one\nanother, the three in one: where one of them is, the others also must be; they\nare the three aspects of the One without a second--the Existence-Knowledge-\nBliss. When that existence becomes relative, we see it as the world; that\nknowledge becomes in its turn modified into the knowledge of the things of the\nworld; and that bliss forms the foundation of all true love known to the heart\nof man. Therefore true love can never react so as to cause pain either to the\nlover or to the beloved. Suppose a man loves a woman; he wishes to have her\nall to himself and feels extremely jealous about her every movement; he wants\nher to sit near him, to stand near him, and to eat and move at his bidding. He\nis a slave to her and wishes to have her as his slave. That is not love; it is\na kind of morbid affection of the slave, insinuating itself as love. It cannot\nbe love, because it is painful; if she does not do what he wants, it brings\nhim pain. With love there is no painful reaction; love only brings a reaction\nof bliss; if it does not, it is not love; it is a mistaking something else for\nlove. When you have succeeded in loving your husband, your wife, your\nchildren, the whole world, the universe, in such a manner that there is no\nreaction of pain or jealousy, no selfish feeling, then you are in a fit state\nto be unattached.\n\nKrishna says: Look at Me, Arjuna! If I stop from work for one moment the whole\nuniverse will die. I have nothing to gain from work; I am the one Lord, but\nwhy do I work? Because I love the world. God is unattached because He loves;\nthat real love makes us unattached. Wherever there is attachment, the clinging\nto the things of the world, you must know that it is all physical, attraction\nbetween sets of particles of matter; something that attracts two bodies nearer\nand nearer all the time, and if\n\np. 57\n\nthey cannot get near enough produces pain; but where there is real love it\ndoes not rest on physical attachment at all. Such lovers may be a thousand\nmiles away from one another, but their love will be all the same; it does not\ndie; and will never produce any painful reaction.\n\nTo attain this unattachment is almost a life-work, but as soon as we have\nreached this point we have attained the goal of love and become free; the\nbondage of nature falls from us, and we see nature as she is; she forges no\nmore chains for us; we stand entirely free and take not the results of work\ninto consideration; who then cares for what the results may be?\n\nDo you ask anything from your children in return for what you have given them?\nIt is your duty to work for them, and there the matter ends. In whatever you\ndo for a particular person, a city, or a state, assume the same attitude\ntowards it as you have towards your children--expect nothing in return. If you\ncan invariably take the position of a giver, in which everything given by you\nis a free offering to the world, without any thought of return, then will your\nwork bring you no attachment. Attachment comes only where we expect a return.\n\nIf working like slaves result in selfishness and attachment, working as\nmasters of our own mind gives rise to the bliss of non-attachment. We often\ntalk of right and justice, but we find that in the world right and justice are\nmere baby\'s talk. There are two things which guide the conduct of men: might\nand mercy. The exercise of might is invariably the exercise of selfishness.\nAll men and women try to make the most of whatever power or advantage they\nhave. Mercy is heaven itself; to be good we have all to be merciful. Even\njustice and right should stand on mercy. All thought of obtaining return for\nthe work we do hinders our spiritual progress; nay, in the end it brings\nmisery. There is another way in which this idea of mercy and selfless charity\ncan be put into\n\np. 58\n\npractice; that is, by looking upon works as "worship" in case we believe in a\npersonal God. Here we give up all the fruits of our work unto the Lord; and,\nworshipping Him thus, we have no right to expect anything from mankind for the\nwork we do. The Lord Himself works incessantly and is ever without attachment.\nJust as water cannot wet the lotus leaf, so work cannot bind the unselfish man\nby giving rise to attachment to results. The selfless and unattached man may\nlive in the very heart of a crowded and sinful city; he will riot be touched\nby sin.\n\nThis idea of complete self-sacrifice is illustrated in the following\nstory:--After the battle of Kurukshetra the five Pandava brothers performed a\ngreat sacrifice and made very large gifts to the poor. All people expressed\namazement at the greatness and richness of the sacrifice, and said that such a\nsacrifice the world had never seen before. But, after the ceremony, there came\na little mongoose; half his body was golden, and the other half was brown; and\nhe began to roll on the floor of the sacrificial hall. He said to those\naround, "You are all liars; this is no sacrifice." "What!" they exclaimed,\n"you say this is no sacrifice; do you not know how money and jewels were\npoured out to the poor and every one became rich and happy? This was the most\nwonderful sacrifice any man ever performed." But the mongoose said, "There was\nonce a little village, and in it there dwelt a poor Brahman, with his wife,\nhis son and his son\'s wife. They were very poor and lived on small gifts made\nto them for preaching and teaching. There came in that land a three years\'\nfamine, and the poor Brahman suffered more than ever. At last when the family\nhad starved for days, the father brought home one morning a little barley\nflour,. which he had been fortunate enough to obtain, and he divided it into\nfour parts, one for each member of the family. They prepared it for their\nmeal, and just as they were about to eat there was a knock at the door.\n\np. 59\n\n[paragraph continues] The father opened it, and there stood a guest. Now in\nIndia a guest is a sacred person; he is as a god for the time being, and must\nbe treated as such. So the poor Brahman said, \'Come in, sir; you are welcome.\'\nHe set before the guest his own portion of the food, which the guest quickly\nate and said, \'Oh, sir, you have killed me; I have been starving for ten days,\nand this little bit has but increased my hunger.\' Then the wife said to her\nhusband, \'Give him my share,\' but the husband said, \'Not so.\' The wife however\ninsisted, saying, \'Here is a poor man, and it is our duty as householders to\nsee that he is fed, and it is my duty as a wife to give him my portion, seeing\nthat you have no more to offer him.\' Then she gave her share to the guest,\nwhich he ate, and said he was still burning with hunger. So the son said,\n\'Take my portion also; it is the duty of a son to help his father to fulfil\nhis obligations.\' The guest ate that, but remained still unsatisfied; so the\nson\'s wife gave him her portion also. That was sufficient, and the guest\ndeparted, blessing them. That night those four people died of starvation. A\nfew granules of that flour had fallen on the floor, and when I rolled my body\non them half of it became golden, as you see. Since then I have been\ntravelling all over the world, hoping to find another sacrifice like that, but\nnowhere have I found one; nowhere else has the other half of my body been\nturned into gold. That is why I say this is no sacrifice.\n\nThis idea of charity is going out of India; great men are becoming fewer and\nfewer. When I was first learning English I read an English story book, in\nwhich there was a story about a dutiful boy who had gone out to work and had\ngiven some of his money to his old mother, and this was praised in three or\nfour pages. What was that? No Hindu boy can ever understand the moral of that\nstory. Now I understand it when I hear the Western idea--every man for\nhimself. And some men take everything for\n\np. 60\n\nthemselves, and fathers and mothers and wives and children go to the wall.\nThat should never and nowhere be the ideal of the householder.\n\nNow you see what _Karma-Yoga_ means; even at the point of death to help any\none, without asking questions. Be cheated millions of times and never ask a\nquestion, and never think of what you are doing. Never vaunt of your gifts to\nthe poor or expect their gratitude, but rather be grateful to them for giving\nyou the occasion of practising charity to them. Thus it is plain that to be an\nideal householder is a much more difficult task than to be an ideal Sannyasin;\nthe true life of work is indeed as hard as, if not harder than, the equally\ntrue life of renunciation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV.
