Then Bhargava Vaidarbhi asked him: 'Sir, How many gods 1 keep what has\nthus been created, how many manifest this 2, and who is the best of them?'\n\n2\\. He replied: 'The ether is that god, the wind, fire, water, earth, speech,\nmind, eye, and ear. These, when they have manifested (their power), contend\nand say: We (each of us) support this body and keep it 3.\n\n3 4. Then Pra _n_ a (breath, spirit, life), as the best, said to them: Be not\ndeceived, I alone, dividing myself fivefold, support this body and keep it.\n\n4\\. They were incredulous; so he, from pride, did as if he were going out from\nabove. Thereupon,\n\np. 275\n\nas he went out, all the others went out, and as he returned, all the others\nreturned. As bees go out when their queen 1 goes out, and return when she\nreturns, thus (did) speech, mind, eye, and ear; and, being satisfied, they\npraise Pra _n_ a, saying:\n\n5\\. He is Agni (fire), he shines as Surya (sun), he is Par _g_ anya (rain),\nthe powerful (Indra), he is Vayu, (wind), he is the earth, he is matter, he is\nGod--he is what is and what is not, and what is immortal.\n\n6\\. As spokes in the nave of a wheel, everything is fixed in Pra _n_ a, the\nverses of the _Ri_ g-veda, Ya _g_ ur-veda, Sama-veda, the sacrifice, the\nKshatriyas, and the Brahmans.\n\n7\\. As Pra _g_ apati (lord of creatures) thou movest about in the womb, thou\nindeed art born again. To thee, the Pra _n_ a, these creatures bring\nofferings, to thee who dwellest with the other pra _n_ as (the organs of\nsense).\n\n8\\. Thou art the best carrier for the Gods, thou art the first offering 2 to\nthe Fathers. Thou art the true work of the Rishis 3, of the Atharva\xe1\xb9\x85giras.\n\n9\\. O Pra _n_ a, thou art Indra by thy light, thou art Rudra, as a protector;\nthou movest in the sky, thou art the sun, the lord of lights.\n\n10\\. When thou showerest down rain, then, O Pra _n_ a, these creatures of\nthine are delighted 4, hoping that there will be food, as much as they desire.\n\np. 276\n\n11\\. Thou art a Vratya 1, O Pra _n_ a, the only _Ri_ shi 2, the consumer of\neverything, the good lord. We are the givers of what thou hast to consume,\nthou, O Matari _s_ va 3, art our father.\n\n12\\. Make propitious that body of thine which dwells in speech, in the ear, in\nthe eye, and which pervades the mind; do not go away!\n\n13\\. All this is in the power of Pra _n_ a, whatever exists in the three\nheavens. Protect us like a mother her sons, and give us happiness and wisdom.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[274:1](sbe15107.htm#fr_881) Deva _h_ , powers, organs, senses.\n\n[274:2](sbe15107.htm#fr_882) Their respective power.\n\n[274:3](sbe15107.htm#fr_883) This is _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's explanation, in which ba _n_\na is taken to mean the same as _s_ arira, body. But there seems to be no\nauthority for such a meaning, and \xc3\x82nandagiri tries in vain to find an\netymological excuse for it. Ba _n_ a or Va _n_ a generally means an arrow, or,\nparticularly in Brahma _n_ a writings, a harp with many strings. I do not see\nhow an arrow could be used as an appropriate simile here, but a harp might, if\nwe take avash _t_ abhya in the sense of holding the frame of the instrument,\nand vidharayama _h_ in the sense of stretching and thereby modulating it.\n\n[274:4](sbe15107.htm#fr_884) On this dispute of the organs of sense, see B\n_ri_ h. Up. VI, 1, p. 201; _Kh_ and. Up. V, 1 (S. B. E., vol. i, p. 72).\n\n[275:1](sbe15107.htm#fr_885) In Sanskrit it is madhukarara _g_ a, king of the\nbees.\n\n[275:2](sbe15107.htm#fr_886) When a _s_ raddha is offered to the Pit _ri_ s.\n\n[275:3](sbe15107.htm#fr_887) Explained as the eye and the other organs of\nsense which the chief Pra _n_ a supports; but it is probably an old verse,\nhere applied to a special purpose.\n\n[275:4](sbe15107.htm#fr_888) Another reading is pra _n_ ate, they breathe.\n\n[276:1](sbe15107.htm#fr_889) A person for whom the sa _m_ skaras, the\nsacramental and initiatory rites, have not been performed. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara says\nthat, as he was the first born, there was no one to perform them for him, and\nthat he is called Vratya, because he was pure by nature. This is all very\ndoubtful.\n\n[276:2](sbe15107.htm#fr_890) Agni is said to be the _Ri_ shi of the \xc3\x82tharva\n_n_ as.\n\n[276:3](sbe15107.htm#fr_891) Instead of the irregular vocative Matari _s_ va,\nthere is another reading, Matari _s_ vana _h_ , i.e. thou art the father of\nMatari _s_ van, the wind, and therefore of the whole world.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Third Question](sbe15108.htm)\n\n"
