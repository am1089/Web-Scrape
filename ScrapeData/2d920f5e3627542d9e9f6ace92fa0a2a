He prepares the Praya _n_ iya rice-pap for Aditi. Now while the\ngods were spreading (performing) the sacrifice on this (earth) they excluded\nher (the earth) from the sacrifice. She thought, 'How is it that, in spreading\nthe sacrifice on me, they should exclude me from the sacrifice?' and\nconfounded their sacrifice: they knew not that sacrifice.\n\np. 48\n\n3:2:3:22\\. They said, 'How comes it that our sacrifice was confounded, when we\nspread it on this (earth)? how is it that we know it not?'\n\n3:2:3:33\\. They said, 'In spreading the sacrifice on her, we have excluded her\nfrom the sacrifice: it is she that has confounded our sacrifice,--let us have\nrecourse to her!'\n\n3:2:3:44\\. They said, 'When we were spreading the sacrifice on thee, how was\nit that it became confounded, that we know it not?'\n\n3:2:3:55\\. She said, 'While spreading the sacrifice on me, ye have excluded me\nfrom the sacrifice: that was why I have confounded your sacrifice. Set ye\naside a share for me; then ye shall see the sacrifice, then ye shall know it!'\n\n3:2:3:66\\. 'So be it!' said the gods: 'Thine, forsooth, shall be the opening\n(praya _n_ iya 1), and thine the concluding (udayaniya) oblation!' This is why\nboth the Praya _n_ iya and the Udayaniya (pap) belong\n\np. 49\n\nto Aditi; for Aditi truly is this (earth). Thereupon they saw and spread the\nsacrifice.\n\n3:2:3:77\\. Hence, when he prepares the Praya _n_ iya rice-pap for Aditi, he\ndoes so for the purpose of his seeing the sacrifice: 'After seeing the\nsacrifice I shall buy (the Soma) and spread that (sacrifice);' thus thinking\nhe prepares the Praya _n_ iya pap for Aditi. The sacrificial food had been\nprepared, but offering had not yet been made to the deity (Aditi),--\n\n3:2:3:88\\. When Pathya Svasti 1 appeared to them. They offered to her, for\nPathya Svasti (the wishing of 'a happy journey') is speech, and the sacrifice\nalso is speech. Thereby they perceived the sacrifice and spread it.\n\n3:2:3:99\\. Thereupon Agni appeared to them: they offered to him; whereby they\nperceived that part of the sacrifice which was of Agni's nature. Now of Agni's\nnature is what is dry in the sacrifice: that they thereby perceived and\nspread.\n\n3:2:3:1010\\. Then Soma appeared to them: they offered to him; whereby they\nperceived that part of the sacrifice which was of Soma's nature. Now of Soma's\nnature is what is moist in the sacrifice: that they thereby perceived and\nspread.\n\n3:2:3:1111\\. Then Savit _ri_ appeared to them: they offered to him. Now Savit\n_ri_ represents cattle, and the sacrifice also means cattle: hence they\nthereby perceived and spread the sacrifice. Thereupon they offered to the\ndeity (Aditi), for whom the sacrificial food had been prepared.\n\n3:2:3:1212\\. It is to these same five deities, then, that he offers. For that\nsacrifice, when thrown into disorder,\n\np. 50\n\nwas in five parts; and by means of those five deities they recognised it.\n\n3:2:3:1313\\. The seasons became confounded, the five: by means of those same\nfive deities they recognised them.\n\n3:2:3:1414\\. The regions became confounded, the five: by means of those same\nfive deities they recognised them.\n\n3:2:3:1515\\. Through Pathya Svasti they recognised the northern (upper)\nregion: wherefore speech sounds higher here 1 among the Kuru-Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas;\nfor she (Pathya Svasti) is in reality speech, and through her they recognised\nthe northern region, and to her belongs the northern region.\n\n3:2:3:1616\\. Through Agni they recognised the eastern region: wherefore they\ntake out Agni from behind towards the east 2, and render homage to him; for\nthrough him they recognised the eastern region, and to him belongs the eastern\nregion.\n\n3:2:3:1717\\. Through Soma they recognised the southern region: hence, after\nthe Soma has been bought, they drive it round on the south side; and hence\nthey say that Soma is sacred to the Fathers; for through him they recognised\nthe southern region, and to him belongs the southern region.\n\n3:2:3:1818\\. Through Savit _ri_ they recognised the western region, for Savit\n_ri_ is yonder burning (sun): wherefore he goes towards the west, for through\nhim they recognised the western region, and to him belongs the western region.\n\np. 51\n\n3:2:3:1919\\. Through Aditi they recognised the upper region, for Aditi is this\n(earth): wherefore the plants and trees grow upwards on her; for through her\nthey recognised the upper region, and to her belongs the upper region.\n\n3:2:3:2020\\. The hospitable reception 1 (of King Soma) verily is the head of\nthe sacrifice, and the opening and closing oblations are its arms. But the\narms are on both sides of the head, and hence those two oblations, the Praya\n_n_ iya and Udayaniya, are made on both sides of (before and after) the\nreception.\n\n3:2:3:2121\\. Now, they say that whatever is done at the Praya _n_ iya should\nbe done at the Udayaniya 2, and the barhis (grass-covering of the altar),\nwhich is used at the Praya _n_ iya, is also used at the Udayaniya: he lays it\naside, after removing it (from the altar). The pot (in which the rice-pap was\ncooked) he puts aside with the parched remains of dough, and (so he does) the\npot-ladle after wiping it. And the priests who officiate during the Praya _n_\niya, officiate also at the Udayaniya. And because of this identical\nperformance at the sacrifice the two arms are alike and of the same shape.\n\n3:2:3:2222\\. But let him not do it in this way. Let him rather 3 (at the\nproper time) throw both the barhis and the pot-ladle after (the prastara, into\nthe fire 4), and let him put the pot aside after rinsing it. The priests who\nofficiate during the Praya _n_ iya, officiate also at the Udayaniya; but\nshould they (in the\n\np. 52\n\nmean time) have departed this life, others may officiate instead. It is\nbecause he offers to the same deities, and the same oblations, that the two\narms are alike and of the same shape.\n\n3:2:3:2323\\. To five deities he offers at the Praya _n_ iya, and to five at\nthe Udayaniya: hence there are five fingers here and five there. This (Praya\n_n_ iya offering) ends with the _S_ amyu. They perform no Patnisa _m_ ya _g_\nas 1. For the arms are on the fore-part of the body, and the fore-part of the\nsacrifice he perfects by this (opening ceremony). This is why it ends with the\n_S_ amyu, and why no Patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as are performed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[48:1](sbe2609.htm#fr_126) At [IV, 5, 1, 2](sbe2660.htm#4:5:1:2), the name\npraya _n_ iya is derived from pra-i, to go forth, because by means of this\noffering they, as it were, go forth to buy the Soma. Similarly, udayaniya is\nexplained as the offering he performs after coming out (ud-i) from the bath.\nIn Ait. Br. I, 7, on the other hand, the name praya _n_ iya is explained as\nthat by means of which sacrificers go forward (pra-i) to the heavenly world.\nIn the Soma sacrifice, the Praya _n_ iya and Udayaniya may be said to\ncorrespond to the Fore-offerings and After-offerings (praya _g_ a and anuya\n_g_ a) of the New and Full-moon Sacrifice; though, of course, the Fore- and\nAfter-offerings form part of the praya _n_ iya and udayaniya, as ish _t_ is.\nBut they are peculiar in this respect, that offering is made at both to the\nvery same deities, and that the invitatory prayers (anuvakya) of the praya _n_\niyesh _t_ i form the offering-prayers (ya _g_ ya) of the udayaniyesh _t_ i,\nand vice versa. For these formulas, see \xc3\x82 _s_ val. _S_ rautas. IV, 3; Haug,\nAit. Br. Transl. p. 16. The offering formula of the oblation to Aditi at the\nPraya _n_ iya (and invitatory formula at the Udayaniya), strange to say, is\nnot a _Ri_ k-verse, but one from the Atharvan (VII, 6, 2).\n\n[49:1](sbe2609.htm#fr_127) I.e. 'welfare on the road, or a happy journey,' a\ngenius of well-being and prosperity.\n\n[50:1](sbe2609.htm#fr_128) Atra,? 'there.' In the St. Petersb. Dict. uttarahi\nis here taken in the sense of 'in the north,' instead of 'higher.' See also\npart i, pref. p. xlii, note 1; Weber, Ind. Stud.

VII, 5, 16-19; cf. also note on [III, 2, 4,\n14](sbe2610.htm#3:2:4:14).\n\n[51:4](sbe2609.htm#fr_133) See I, 8, 3, 19; 9, 2, 29.\n\n[52:1](sbe2609.htm#fr_134) For the _S_ amyuvaka, see I, 9, 1, 24; for the\nPatnisa _m_ ya _g_ as, I, 9, 2: 1 seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 4.
