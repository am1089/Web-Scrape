And on account of the passage referring to that which is distinguished by\npleasure (i.e. Brahman).\n\nThere is, moreover, really no room for dispute whether Brahman be meant in the\npassage under discussion or not, because the fact of Brahman being meant is\nestablished 'by the reference to that which is distinguished by pleasure.' For\nthe same Brahman which is spoken of as characterised by pleasure in the\nbeginning of the chapter 2, viz. in the clauses, 'Breath is Brahman, Ka is\nBrahman, Kha is Brahman,' that same Brahman we must suppose to be referred to\nin the present passage also, it being proper to adhere to the subject-matter\nunder discussion; the clause, 'The teacher will tell you the way 3,' merely\nannouncing that the way will be proclaimed [by the teacher; not that a new\nsubject will be started].--How then, it may be asked, is it known that\nBrahman, as distinguished by pleasure, is spoken of in the beginning of the\npassage?--We reply: On hearing the speech of the fires, viz. 'Breath is\nBrahman, Ka is Brahman, Kha is Brahman,' Upako _s_ ala says, 'I understand\nthat breath is Brahman, but I do not understand that Ka or Kha is Brahman.'\nThereupon the fires reply, 'What is Ka is Kha, what is Kha is Ka.' Now the\nword Kha denotes in ordinary language the elemental ether. If therefore the\nword Ka which means pleasure were not applied to qualify the sense of 'Kha,'\nwe should conclude\n\np. 127\n\nthat the name Brahman is here symbolically 1 given to the mere elemental ether\nas it is (in other places) given to mere names and the like. Thus also with\nregard to the word Ka, which, in ordinary language, denotes the imperfect\npleasure springing from the contact of the sense-organs with their objects. If\nthe word Kha were not applied to qualify the sense of Ka we should conclude\nthat ordinary pleasure is here called Brahman. But as the two words Ka and Kha\n(occur together and therefore) qualify each other, they intimate Brahman whose\nSelf is pleasure. If 2 in the passage referred to (viz. 'Breath is Brahman, Ka\nis Brahman, Kha is Brahman') the second Brahman (i.e. the word Brahman in the\nclause 'Ka is Brahman ') were not added, and if the sentence would run 'Ka,\nKha is Brahman,' the word Ka would be employed as a mere qualifying word, and\nthus pleasure as being a mere quality would not be represented as a subject of\nmeditation. To prevent this, both words--Ka as well as Kha--are joined with\nthe word Brahman ('Ka (is) Brahman, Kha (is) Brahman'). For the passage wishes\nto intimate that pleasure also, although a quality, should be meditated upon\nas something in which qualities inhere. It thus appears that at the beginning\nof the chapter Brahman, as characterised by pleasure, is spoken of. After that\nthe Garhapatya and the other sacred fires proclaim in turns their own glory,\nand finally conclude with the words, 'This is our knowledge, O friend, and the\nknowledge of the Self;' wherein they point back to the Brahman spoken of\nbefore. The words, 'The teacher will tell you the way' (which form the last\nclause of the concluding passage), merely promise an explanation of the way,\nand thus preclude the idea of another topic being started. The teacher\nthereupon saying, 'As water does not cling to a lotus leaf, so no evil deed\nclings to one who knows it' (which words intervene between the concluding\n\np. 128\n\nspeech of the fires and the information given by the teacher about the person\nwithin the eye) declares that no evil attacks him who knows the person within\nthe eye, and thereby shows the latter to be Brahman. It thus appears that the\nteacher's intention is to speak about that Brahman which had formed the topic\nof the instruction of the fires; to represent it at first as located in the\neye and possessing the qualities of Sa _m_ yadvama and the like, and to point\nout afterwards that he who thus knows passes on to light and so on. He\ntherefore begins by saying, 'That person that is seen in the eye that is the\nSelf.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[126:1](sbe34051.htm#fr_149) The _t_ ikas say that the contents of this last\nsentence are hinted at by the word 'and' in the Sutra.\n\n[126:2](sbe34052.htm#fr_150) I.e. at the beginning of the instruction which\nthe sacred fires give to Upako _s_ ala, _Kh_.
