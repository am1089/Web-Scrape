The date\ndoes not matter to us today, but his philosophy does, for it is regarded by\nsome millions of people, and especially by the intellectuals, as the very\npinnacle of Aryan thought. It was not that he originated a new philosophy,\nthough he did propound a self-culture or discipline necessary to the\nunderstanding of it.\n\nShankar\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81rya expounded with great clarity and completeness the already\nexisting philosophy of the Upanishads\xc2\x97a section of the Vedas often called the\nVed\xc4\x81nta, or end of the Veda, containing the "last word" or highest teaching\nabout the nature of Brahman (God),\n\np. 64\n\nman and the world. This teaching summed up its conclusions in a number of\nGreat Sayings, including "There is one reality, but the intellectual persons\nspeak of it variously," "All this certainly is Brahman," " _That_ is the\nreality," " _That_ , thou art" and other similar sentences to be (r) listened\nto, (2) thought about and (3) meditated upon, for the attainment of knowledge\nof the deepest truth, the very secret of life, the discovery which reveals the\nunalloyed freedom and happiness of our true self, when false ideas are put\naside.\n\n_Gny \xc4\x81na_ or _Jn \xc4\x81na_ is knowledge. The central doctrine of this philosophy is\nthat everything is one, and it can be known. But that knowing is only by\nbeing. We know ourselves not by words but by being ourselves, do we not? And\nthis is happiness, for it seems that though this consciousness of self that we\nfind ourselves to be is troubled, we always ascribe that trouble to something\nelse\xc2\x97something outside\xc2\x97which restricts or annoys us. Who is there who blames\nhimself for his sorrow? Even the thoughtful person who calls himself imperfect\nascribes his troubles and sorrows to the imperfections, and says that if he\ncould be without them he would be happy. Generally he tries to get rid of\nthem. So it is by the study of the self that this philosophy proceeds to\ndisclose the occult or secret truth which removes the imperfections and leaves\nthe self free and joyous.\n\np. 65\n\nShankar\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81rya says in one word what all these imperfections are, what it is\nthat we suffer from\xc2\x97it is ignorance, _avidy \xc4\x81_. It will be, then, the very\nheight of practical occultism to dispel that ignorance. Because of wrong\nassumptions we make mistakes, even with the best of intentions\xc2\x97even the\nintentions are imperfect because of ignorance. So thoughts, intentions and\nactions are all clouded by ignorance. Finally, even actions are tremendously\nconfused, and without power, because of ignorance.\n\nThis is true occultism, then\xc2\x97the dissolution of ignorance at its source, not\nany small potterings for the gaining of petty pleasures or for the removal of\npetty pains, but to look behind the veil and find the pure self and no longer\nplay about in the fields of ignorance. This is the real business of life, the\nUpanishads assert, which can be done, and has been done by successful human\nbeings, who have seen the error and mastered it. At the very least it is\nbetter not to walk into new trouble than to busy oneself merely with removing\nthe old.\n\nFirst of all, Shankar\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81rya makes a distinction between people who want to\n_have_ and those who want to _know_. To have is connected with external\nthings. The whole world consists of things to have. Shankara does not deny the\ninfinity of worlds or the existence of "higher planes," containing lofty and\nglorious beings or gods, or that by desiring things\n\np. 66\n\nof higher planes or heavens and by worshipping the gods people may obtain\ncenturies and even millennia of delight in various lofty heavens; but he\naffirms that all those things are the playthings of children or the tinsel of\nfools, who are making them all for themselves because they have not thought\nabout the eternal realities.\n\nHe therefore draws a decided distinction between _dharma-jign \xc4\x81sa_ (the desire\nto know what should be done in order to obtain better conditions on earth and\nin heaven) and _Brahma-jign \xc4\x81sa_ (the desire to know that which is eternal).\nThis is discussed very decisively in Shankara\'s commentary on the first of the\n_Brahma-S \xc5\xabtras_ or aphorisms. The desire for the "heavens" must be preceded\nby sense-experience, and confidence in the Vedas, which declare that the\nheavens exist; but the desire for Brahman must be preceded by thought, thought\nand more thought ( _vich \xc4\x81ra_), especially with reference to an understanding\nof the distinction ( _viveka_ ) between the eternal ( _nitya_ ) and temporary\n( _anitya_ ) realities. In emphasizing thought, however, Shankara does not\nleave out study of the Ved\xc4\x81nta, which contains much information and advice\nabout seeking the eternal. Shankara\'s emphasis on thinking is very clear in\nhis _Aparoksh \xc4\x81nubh\xc5\xabti_: "Thinking should be done for the sake of attaining\nknowledge of the Self. Knowledge\n\np. 67\n\nis not attained by any means other than thinking, just as objects are never\nseen without light. \'Who am I?\' \'How is this world produced?\' \'Who made it?\'\nand \'What is the material?\'\xc2\x97such is the enquiry." 1\n\nIt is well known that we do not see things as they really are, because of our\nlimited point of view, and yet there is in us the craving for greater\nunderstanding, because the human soul is one with the divine or universal\nsoul. Each one of us reflects that, just as the disc of the sun may be\nreflected in many little pools of water. We have thus a dual nature, and\nthough the lower may be satisfied, still the higher makes its claim in a\nceaseless desire to understand. If human power and love were to grow so great,\nas to make our life on earth a perfect paradise of peace and plenty for all,\nstill men would say, "Now, we want to know why all this is so." There are the\nneeds of the personality\xc2\x97food, clothing and shelter, amusement and education,\nexercise and rest\xc2\x97but beyond these there are spiritual needs, and among them\nis the real hunger for understanding.\n\nIt is not supposed by Shankara that the average or ordinary man can think\nstraight in these matters. He prescribes a course of what may be called\npurification as a preparation. This is called the _s \xc4\x81dhanachatushtayam_, the\n"group of four accomplishments."\n\np. 68\n\n[paragraph continues] They present three departments of self-training, and a\nconcluding condition of mind, as will be seen in the following table:\n\nNAME OF ACCOMPLISHMENT\n\n|\n\nFunction  \ninvolved  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n_In Sanskrit_\n\n|\n\n_In English_  \n  \n1\\. Viveka\n\n|\n\nDiscrimination\n\n|\n\nThought  \n  \n2\\. Vair\xc4\x81gya\n\n|\n\nUncoloredness\n\n|\n\nFeelings  \n  \n3\\. Shatsampatti\n\n|\n\n6 Successes\n\n|\n\nThe Will  \n  \n4\\. Mumukshatwa\n\n|\n\nThe State of Longing for Liberation  \n  \n_Viveka_ is the practice of discrimination between the fleeting and the\npermanent. This is the first of three preliminary yogas in this school. It is\nhere that the thinking, thinking, thinking, begins. It is to be applied to\noneself, to others and to the whole business of life. It is an inspection of\nthe contents of one\'s ordinary self, to discriminate between the relatively\ntemporary and permanent. First one may dwell upon the body and realize that it\nis only an instrument for the conscious self to play upon. Then, one may dwell\non the habits of feeling and emotion which have been accumulated during the\npresent lifetime (or, strictly, bodytime), and realize these also to be part\nof the instrument\xc2\x97"I am surely not my feelings and emotions towards things and\npeople." Thirdly, one must meditate upon the fact that the lower mind, the\ncollection of information, ideas and opinions that one\n\np. 69\n\nhas acquired up to this period, is also not the self, but merely an internal\nlibrary more or less imperfectly indexed, in which the books have a tendency\nto open at certain places because they have been opened there many times\nbefore.\n\nThis meditation may then be applied to other people, so that one comes to\nthink of them as the consciousness beyond the personality, and in dealing with\nthem to assist and further the higher purposes of the Self within them rather\nthan the desires rising from the personality. Being a material thing, even up\nto the mental plane, that personality has its own quality of inertia, and\ndislikes the discomfort involved in new thinking and willing and feeling,\nuntil it is well trained and learns to rejoice in the sharing of a life more\nthan its own. But we must also help to bring the day of triumph nearer for all\nwhom we contact, as Shr\xc4\xab Shankar\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81rya did, for he was one of the world\'s\nbusiest men.\n\nThis meditation must be extended still further to all the business of life, to\nthe family, the shop, the field, the office, society. All these things must be\nconsidered as of importance not as they minister to the laziness, selfishness\nor thoughtlessness of the personality, but as they bear on the advancement in\npower of will, love and thought of the evolving consciousness in all\nconcerned. It will be seen that works and\n\np. 70\n\ntheir objects pass away, but the faculty and ability gained by them remains in\nthe man.\n\nFifteen to thirty minutes of this kind of meditation each day is sufficient to\nestablish very soon an entirely new outlook in the personality. Emerson speaks\nof something of the same kind in his essay on "Inspiration," as the way to an\naltogether richer life than any of us can possibly reach without it. It can\noften be practiced to some extent under unfavorable conditions, as for example\nin the railway train, if one makes up one\'s mind to take the various\ndisturbances of it with a sweet temper, and lend oneself to the rhythm of its\nnoise.\n\nThe second requirement is _vair \xc4\x81gya_, an emotional condition in which one\ndoes not respond at once to impressions coming from the outer world, but first\nsubmits the matter to the discriminative power rising from viveka. If you\nstrike an ordinary man, he will get hot and strike back, or run away, or do\nsomething else spontaneous and scarcely rational; but a man having _vair \xc4\x81gya_\nwould use his spiritual intelligence before responding. The literal meaning of\nthe word _vair \xc4\x81gya_ is "absence of color," and in this connection it means\nabsence of passion. _R \xc4\x81ga_ is coloring, especially redness. People everywhere\ntake their emotional coloring from their environment, according to well known\npsychological laws; like pieces of glass placed on blue or red or green paper,\nthey change\n\np. 71\n\ntheir color. Likes and dislikes rise up in them without reason, at the mere\nsight of various objects, and the appearance of different persons calls up\npride, anger, fear and other personal emotions.\n\nThey are constantly judging things not with their intelligence but by their\nfeelings and emotional habits. "This is good, that is bad," means generally\nnothing more than, "I like this; I do not like that." A man dislikes a thing\nbecause it disturbs his physical or emotional convenience or his comfortable\nconvictions, "I thought I had done with thinking about that\xc2\x97take it away,\nconfound you," grumbles the man comfortably settled in his opinions, as in a\nbig armchair.\n\n_Vair \xc4\x81gya_ is the absence of agitation due to things outside. A mistaken idea\nwhich is sometimes associated with this word is that it implies absence of\nemotion. That is not so. The purified personality responds to the higher\nemotions, the love emotions that belong to the real self. Those emotions come\nfrom that aspect of the indwelling consciousness which feels other lives to be\nas interesting as one\'s own. This is the root of all the love\nemotions\xc2\x97admiration, kindness, friendship, devotion and others\xc2\x97which must not\nbe confused with any sort of passion, which is personal or bodily desire. If a\nman has _vair \xc4\x81gya_ and he is still at all emotional, his emotion must express\nsome form of love.\n\np. 72\n\n_Vair \xc4\x81gya_ may be developed by a form of meditation in which the aspirant\nshould picture and turn over in mind the various things that have been causing\nhim agitation, or the disturbing emotions of pride, anger and fear. Having\nmade a picture of the cat spilling the ink on the best tablecloth, or of your\nenemy putting in a bad word for you with your employer or superior behind your\nback, you calmly look at it, meditate on it, and the light of your own\nintelligence will see the real value of the experience and this removal of\nignorance will also remove the agitating emotion. This is a question of\nfeeling, not of action. Do not here substitute the deadly coldness that some\npeople sometimes feel instead of anger, and imagine that to be the calm state.\n\nThe calmness obtained in this way will soon make all the other meditation far\nmore effective than before, because meditation best opens the door to the\ninner world and all its inspiration when the body is quiet, the emotions are\ncalm, and the attention is turned to the subject of thought without any\nmuscular or nervous strain or physical sensation whatever. Incidentally it\nshould be said that meditation with physical sensation or strain may prove\ninjurious to health, but meditation rightly done in this way can never do the\nleast harm.\n\nThe third requirement is called _shatsampatti_ ,\n\np. 73\n\nwhich may be translated "the six forms of success." The will is now used to\nmake all conditions favorable for the further development of _viveka_. To\nunderstand the function of the will, it is necessary to realize that it is the\nfaculty with which we change _ourselves_. Thought is _kriyashakti_ , the power\nof mind that acts upon matter; but it is the will with which we change our\nthoughts and other inward conditions. Now will-power is to be used to bring\nthe whole life of the man within the purpose of _jn \xc4\x81na-yoga_. This work is\nthe equivalent of the _tapas_ of Patanjali and the _sev \xc4\x81_ of Shr\xc4\xab Krishna.\n\nThe six forms of success are: (1) _shama_ , control of mind, (2) _dama_ ,\ncontrol of body; (3) _uparati_ , which means cessation from eagerness to have\ncertain persons and things around one, and therefore a willing acceptance of\nwhat the world offers\xc2\x97contentment with regard to things and tolerance with\nregard to persons, a glad acceptance of the material available for a life\'s\nwork. The fourth is _titiksh \xc4\x81_, patience, the cheerful endurance of trying\nconditions and the sequence of karma. The fifth is _shraddh \xc4\x81_, fidelity and\nsincerity, and therefore confidence in oneself and others. The sixth is\nsam\xc4\x81dh\xc4\x81na, steadiness, with all the forces gathered together and turned to the\ndefinite purpose in hand.\n\nEvery one of these six practices shows the will at\n\np. 74\n\nwork producing that calm strength which is its own special characteristic.\nThis is necessary for yoga, and anything in the nature of fuss or push, or\nexcitement is against it. In no case does this calmness mean the reduction of\nactivity or work, but always that the work is done with greater strength but\nless noise. Success is marked by quietness, the best indication of power. Thus\nthe mind and body will be active but calm; and there will be contentment,\npatience, sincerity and steadiness.\n\nThe three branches of training already mentioned make the entire personality\nexceedingly sensitive to the higher self, so that a great longing arises for a\nfuller measure of realization. This is called _mumukshatwa_ , eagerness for\nliberation.\n\nTo complete this occult knowledge one must combine the _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ doctrine with\nthe self-realization doctrine. It is, of course, the self-realization of\nitself that is the full achievement. And since _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ does not mean something\nunreal but something outside the categories of both the real and unreal, and\nis in fact nothing but error, we shall have to say that the power of _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_\nis a power of the self itself, and that all that is not unreal in the _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_\nis beyond time and space, a part of the self itself, whatever "parts" may\nmean-in the indivisible. The general dictum of all the yogas is fulfilled\nhere\xc2\x97that never will the yog\xc4\xab find something that could be anticipated, but\nonly something\n\np. 75\n\nunknown before, which, however, by universal testimony, is true being, pure\nconsciousness and incredible joy. All the explanations given in this chapter\nand much more will be found in my book on Ved\xc4\x81nta entitled _The Glorious\nPresence_. 2\n\nIt will be useful now to see that the same three means of self-guidance are\nemployed in all the three schools we have studied so far\xc2\x97of Patanjali, of Shr\xc4\xab\nKrishna and of Shankar\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81rya. It becomes obvious when we thus compare them\nthat all are aiming at maturity of mind, the ripening of the three functions\nof will, love and thought. They put these three in different order, however,\nindicating the different temperaments of those who take to the different\nschools of occult practice and thought. The following table will make the\ncomparison clear.\n\n_Patanjali_\n\n|\n\n_Krishna_\n\n|\n\n_Shankara_  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n1\\. _Tapas_  \n    (Will)\n\n|\n\n1\\. _Pranip \xc4\x81ta_  \n    (Love)\n\n|\n\n1\\. _Viveka_  \n    (Thought)  \n  \n2\\. _Sw \xc4\x81dhy\xc4\x81ya_  \n    (Thought)\n\n|\n\n2\\. _Pariprashna_  \n    (Thought)\n\n|\n\n2\\. _Vair \xc4\x81gya_  \n    (Love)  \n  \n3\\. _Ishwara-pranidh \xc4\x81na_  \n    (Love)\n\n|\n\n3\\. _Sev \xc4\x81_  \n    (Will)\n\n|\n\n3\\. _Shatsampatti_  \n    (Will)   \n  \np. 76\n\nWhen the student has followed this preliminary training with some success he\nwill be ready for two things (1) the understanding of the doctrine of _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_,\nand (2) the direct visioning of the Self.\n\n_M \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ has often been translated "illusion," whence it has been thought that\nShankara teaches that all this world does not exist, and people only imagine\nthat it does so\xc2\x97that there is nothing there. That is not so. He does not deny\nthe existence of objects, but affirms that we see them wrongly\xc2\x97just as a man\nmay see a piece of rope on the ground and mistake it for a snake, or as he may\nsee a post in the distance and think it to be a man.\n\nIt is necessary to know that _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ has two functions: "covering-up" ( _\xc4\x81\nvarana_) and "throwing-out" ( _vikshepa_ ). 3 The first is declared to be the\neffect of _tamas_ , which hides or obstructs the life, and the second the\nresult of _rajas_ , or energy. 4 "Covering-up" implies that although we\nare\xc2\x97every one\xc2\x97universal in our essential nature, our attention is now given to\nless than the whole. Most of the reality is covered up, and since we see only\nthe remainder, it must necessarily become unsatisfying and stupid and even\npainful, when we have played with it long enough to exhaust its lessons for\nus. When we have read a book\n\np. 77\n\nand absorbed the ideas in it, we do not want to read it again. If it is forced\nupon us, the experience will be painful. We may laugh at a good joke told by a\nfriend to-day, but if he persists in telling us the same story again and again\nit will be far from a joke. Our life must be moving on, and overcoming the _\xc4\x81\nvarana_; there is no long-lasting pleasure or gain in standing still on any\nplatform of knowledge that we may have gained at any time or stage.\n\n"Covering-up" does not mean that objects of experience lack reality. The _m\n\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ or illusion is that we do not see their _full_ reality; we see too\nlittle, not too much. So far as they go they have an excellent flavor of\nreality, but their incompleteness is unsatisfying.\n\nThe second function of _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_, "throwing-out" ( _vikshepa_ ), means that we\nput forth our thought and energy in reference to that part of reality which\nfor us individually has not been covered up, and thereby we produce the world\nof _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ or created things, which are only temporary ( _anitya_ ).\n\nThe power of "throwing-out" is not merely of the mind, but is actually\ncreative, and this it is which produces all the _forms_ around us, the world\nof manifestation. The objects therein are very much like pictures painted by\nan artist. They represent his expression of such part of the reality as is not\ncovered up. As he looks at the picture and realizes how defective\n\np. 78\n\nand even nonsensical it is, the hunger arises in him for something more\nsatisfying, which then works at removing the "covering-up." Thereby arises\nwhat is called intuition, which always comes as the result of a complete study\nof any fact or group of facts in the world of experience. It is in this manner\nthat experience is educative. It gives us nothing from the outside, but\nenables us to introduce ourselves to a fuller part of reality. So _\xc4\x81 varana_\nresembles concentration, and the result of experience can be compared to\ncontemplation. Thus _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_, while not reality, is also not unreality.\n\nShankara speaks in very strong language about the effect of _\xc4\x81 varana_ and\n_vikshepa_ in practical life: "The function of _\xc4\x81 varana_, made of _tamas_ ,\ncovers up the shining Self, which has unlimited faculties, just as the shadow\nof the moon hides the disc of the sun. When there is thus the obscuration of a\nman\'s real and stainlessly radiant Self, he thinks he is the body, which is\nnot the Self. Then the great power of _rajas_ called _vikshepa_ afflicts him\nby the binding qualities of passion, anger, etc., so that this unintelligent\nman, deprived of real knowledge of the Self, through being swallowed by the\ncrocodile of the great delusion, wanders about, rising and falling in the\nocean of limited existence. As clouds produced by the sun obscure the sun as\nthey develop, so does egotism arising\n\np. 79\n\nfrom the Self obscure the Self as it flourishes. And as on a bad day when\nthick clouds swallow the sun, and they also are afflicted by sharp cold winds,\nso does the power of acute _vikshepa_ annoy the man of confused intelligence\nwith many troubles. By these two powers the man is bound; deluded by them he\nwanders about, thinking the body to be himself." 5\n\nThen comes the question how to remove these two: "Unless the _\xc4\x81 varana_\nfunction ceases completely, vikshepa cannot be conquered. When subject and\nobject are separated, like milk from water, then _\xc4\x81 varana_ disappears on its\nown account in the Self. Perfect discrimination, arising from clear\nperception, having distinguished the subject and the object, cuts away the\nbondage of delusion made by _m \xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_, and then for the free man there is no\nmore wandering about." 6\n\nThe substance of material things is called _sat_ , or being. Consciousness,\nwith its powers of will, love and thought, is called _chit_. Beyond those\nthree aspects of consciousness is _\xc4\x81 nanda_, the true life that is sheer\nhappiness. The being of true life is happiness. First a man must get over the\ndelusion that he _is_ the body, and realize that he is consciousness using the\nbody. He _has_ a body. Then, later on, he must realize that he _is not_ the\npowers of consciousness, but that he simply\n\np. 80\n\n_uses_ these. Then he will be his own true self, _\xc4\x81 nanda_, happiness, which\nis the nature of our pure being. But that happiness is one with consciousness\n( _chit_ ) and being ( _sat_ ), as the man will find on reaching illumination;\nso the world of sat is real, part of his own true life, and not illusion. _M\n\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81_ was the practical effect of the mistake ( _avidy \xc4\x81_) by which he confused\ntogether, first consciousness and external being, and then consciousness and\nhis psychological or internal being.\n\nThe analogy of dreaming is employed to illustrate these points. Just as on\nwaking we realize that our dream was irrational, so on waking from the dream\nthat we now call waking we shall realize the truth that will make our present\noutlook appear irrational. Not that it is irrational, but that the true vision\nhas the correct data or perception. Even our present knowledge, it is said, is\nignorance, or better unwisdom, because we are always looking at things with\nthe eyes of the flesh, while we ought to look at them with the eyes of the\nspirit, that is, from the standpoint of the imperishable consciousness.\n\nThe question then arises\xc2\x97what is the best practical way to attain reality. To\nthis two answers may be given: (1) Realize the infinite possibilities of every\nfinite experience, and (2) do not mix yourself with your objects of\nexperience. As to the first, it means\n\np. 81\n\nsimply that we can learn from one thing what we can learn from many things.\nFor example, a man has one mother. If he has learnt to love that mother, then\nhe is predisposed to love any mother whom he may meet. He does not need to\nlearn the lesson all over again in connection with those other mothers. As\ninstructed in the _G \xc4\xabt\xc4\x81_, by attending to his own experience a man reaches\nperfection.\n\nAnother instance of the same principle is the use of the human body. If we had\nto attain some kind of perfection which involved knowledge of all things which\npeople are making for themselves by their "throwing-out," this body would not\nbe enough. In such a case we should need seven-league boots and a hundred or a\nthousand arms and legs instead of only two of each. But this is not the way of\nthe evolution of life. It can reach its perfection through an ordinary body\nwith two arms and two legs. It need not have the muscular system of a\nprofessional athlete or the mental capacity of a German chemist or\nlexicographer. Realize the infinite possibilities of the moment\'s experience,\ncease to resent any of the experience, and immediately most of the pain and\nsorrow that it may contain is emptied out of it, and it becomes immensely\nfruitful.\n\nThere are two ways in which we may live our lives amidst events of the world,\nwithout retiring at all\n\np. 82\n\nfrom that world. In both cases the mixing with the world will be the same, but\nin one there is real confusion (that is, fusing together) and in the other\nmerely mixing. For example, if milk and water are put together it is very\ndifficult to separate them, but if oil and water are mixed together, although\nthey are together they retain their individuality. So in relation to the world\nwe are to be like oil in water, not milk in water. We must distinguish between\n"the world," "my world" and "myself"\xc2\x97three things, not two. It is like a\nperson playing a game of chess. The board is there\xc2\x97my world. The pieces have\nbeen moved into a certain position. A good player does not become excited and\nflustered, whether he is winning or losing. He cannot, in fact, really in\nhimself either win or lose. Even if his pieces are captured one by one, if he\nhas played the game to the best of his ability he has developed his faculties,\nand on the whole he is a little more likely to profit by a lost than by a won\ngame.\n\nThese facts being established, people sometimes raise the academic question:\n"Whence comes this ignorance which hides the full reality?" With regard to\nthis Buddha\'s advice was: "Sink not the string of thought into the\nfathomless." The fact is that we have to begin our reasoning and our activity\nfrom the place in which we find ourselves. We are apparently\n\np. 83\n\non a ladder, which goes upwards out of sight. The important thing is that it\ngoes upwards. But one would not avoid the ultimate question. The answer to it\nis that space and time are a creation of ignorance\xc2\x97they come into being\nthrough the "covering-up," and disappear for us when the covering is removed.\nHow, then, can the questions, "where" and "whence," which ask for an answer in\nterms of time and space, be applied to this matter? Evidently there is some\nsort of evolution or unfoldment, but it is not a change in time and space.\nThat this is so is indicated by the unchanging character of our feeling of "I"\nwhich is the same point of reference in youth and age, and whether we be here\nor there, and standing on our heads or on our feet.\n\nThe meditations of Shankara are practical, because they are not merely\nthoughts about things, considered as objects, dwelt upon in the third\ngrammatical person. First, the student must say to himself, "I am not _it_\n"\xc2\x97"it" being the personality, physical and psychological, composed of body,\npersonal emotions and fixed ideas. This means not simply the set of "vehicles"\nas they stand, but also their habits of action, emotion and thought\xc2\x97the entire\npersonality. He must put that outside himself. Secondly, he must say, "I am\nnot _you_ ," referring now to that in himself which he would call "you" in\nanother person\xc2\x97the\n\np. 84\n\ncollection of thinkings, lovings and willings or powers of consciousness. The\npersonality is something that you _use_ \xc2\x97not something that you _are_. So also\nthe conscious powers are something that you _use_ , not something that you\n_are_. Thirdly, he must say, "I am I. I can take up and put down these powers\nof consciousness. I can enlarge or reduce them." But in the second stage he\nmust take care to think of his own ordinary consciousness always as _you_ ,\nnever as _it_ , nor as _I_ , otherwise he will remain in the _you_ , and not\nreach the _I_.\n\nAll happiness in life is beyond the limited consciousness and is experienced\nwhen that activity is forgotten. All the delight that comes from response to\nbeauty, love and truth in the world, and from the powers of will, love and\nthought in consciousness, lie in the Self beyond, when the world and the\nlimited self are forgotten, and time and space have been swallowed up in\nsomething greater, beyond their limitations. Beyond common consciousness, in a\nstate better than that limited consciousness, we are, and all clinging to\nmental ideas about oneself, pleasurable or not, bars the realization of that\ntruth. That unchanging _I_ is _\xc4\x81 nanda_, happiness, the one reality. To know\nthis directly, not by logic, is the high purpose of the Ved\xc4\x81nta.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[67:1](gsoy06.htm#fr_44) _Op. cit_., 10-12, abridged translation.\n\n[75:2](gsoy06.htm#fr_45) Published by E.
