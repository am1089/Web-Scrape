(They are seven) on account of the going of the seven and of\nspecification.\n\nThe question here arises whether those organs are seven only, or eleven--the\ndoubt on this point being due to the conflicting nature of scriptural texts.--\nThe Purvapakshin maintains the former alternative.--On what grounds?--\'On\naccount of going, and of specification.\' For the text refers to the \'going,\'\ni.e. to the moving about in the different worlds, together with the soul when\nbeing born or dying, of seven pra _n_ as only, \'seven are these worlds in\nwhich the pra _n_ as move which rest in the cave, being placed there as seven\nand seven\' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 8)--where the repetition \'seven and seven\'\nintimates the plurality of souls to which the pra _n_ as are attached.\nMoreover those moving pra _n_ as are distinctly specified in the following\ntext, \'when the five instruments of knowledge stand still, together with the\nmind (manas), and when the buddhi does not move, that they call the highest\n"going"\' (gati--Ka. Up. II, 6, 10). The \'highest going\' here means the moving\ntowards Release, all movement within the body having\n\np. 571\n\ncome to an end. As thus the text declares that at the time of birth and death\nseven pra _n_ as only accompany the soul, and as, with regard to the condition\nof final concentration, those pra _n_ as are distinctly specified as forms of\nknowledge ( _g \xc3\xb1_anani), we conclude that the pra _n_ as are the seven\nfollowing instruments of the soul--the organs of hearing, feeling, seeing,\ntasting and smelling, the buddhi and the manas. In various other passages\nindeed, which refer to the pra _n_ as, higher numbers are mentioned, viz. up\nto fourteen, speech, the hands, the feet, the anus, the organ of generation,\nthe ahankara and the _k_ itta being added to those mentioned above; cp. e.g.\n\'there are eight grahas\' (B _ri_. Up. III, 2, i); \'Seven are the pra _n_ as of\nthe head, two the lower ones \'(Taitt. Sa _m_ h. V, 3, 2, 5). But as the text\nsays nothing about those additional organs accompanying the soul, we assume\nthat they are called pra _n_ as in a metaphorical sense only, since they all,\nmore or less, assist the soul.--This view the next Sutra sets aside.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 5.
