The Year is Man 1:--'Man' is one unit, and 'year' is another, and\nthese now are one and the same;--there are in the year the two, day and night,\nand in man there are these two breathings, and these now are one and the\nsame;--there are three seasons in the year, and these three breathings in man,\nand these (two) now are one and the same;--'sa _m_ vatsara (year)' consists of\nfour syllables, and so does 'ya _g_ amana (sacrificer),' and these (two) now\nare one and the same;--there are five seasons in the year, and these five\nbreathings in man, and these (two) now are one and the same;--there are six\nseasons in the year, and these six breathings in man, and these (two) now are\none and the same;--there are seven seasons in the year, and these seven\nbreathings in man, and these (two) now are one and the same.\n\n12:3:2:22\\. There are twelve months in the year, and these twelve breathings\nin man, and these (two) now are one and the same;--there are thirteen months\nin the (leap-) year, and these thirteen (channels of) breathings in man, the\nnavel being the thirteenth, and these (two) now are one and the same;--there\nare twenty-four half-months in the year, and this man is twenty-four-fold,\nbeing possessed of twenty fingers and toes and four limbs; and. these (two)\nnow are one and the same;--there are twenty-six half-months in the (leap-)\nyear, and this man is twenty-six-fold, the two feet making up the twenty-six;\nand these (two) now are one and the same.\n\n12:3:2:33\\. And there are three hundred and sixty nights\n\np. 169\n\nin the year, and three hundred and sixty bones in man, and these (two) now are\none and the same;--there are three hundred and sixty days in the year, and\nthree hundred and sixty parts of marrow in man, and these (two) now are one\nand the same.\n\n12:3:2:44\\. And there are seven hundred and twenty days and nights in the\nyear, and seven hundred and twenty bones and parts of marrow in man, and these\n(two) now are one and the same.\n\n12:3:2:55\\. And there are ten thousand and eight hundred 'muhurta' in the\nyear; and fifteen times as many 'kshipras' as there are 'muhurta'; and fifteen\ntimes as many 'etarhi' as there are 'kshipra;' and fifteen times as many\n'idani' as there are 'etarhi'; and fifteen times as many breathings as there\nare 'idani'; and as many spirations as there are breathings 1; and as many\ntwinklings of the eye as there are spirations, and as many hair-pits as there\nare twinklings of the eye, and as many sweat-pores as there are hair-pits; and\nas many sweat-pores as there are so many drops it rains.\n\n12:3:2:66\\. Concerning this, Varkali, knowing this, once said, 'I know the\nraining cloud extending over the whole earth, and the drops of that rain.'\n\n12:3:2:77\\. It is with reference thereto that this verse is told,--Whilst\nwhirling round, be it standing, or sitting, or even sleeping, how often does\nman, otherwise than from toil, breathe and expel the air regularly 2 by day\nand night?\n\n12:3:2:88\\. And in answer thereto this verse is told,--\n\np. 170\n\n[paragraph continues] Inasmuch as man is what is measured a hundred hundred\nand eight hundred, therefore they say:--so often does man regularly 1 breathe\nand expel the air by day and night.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[168:1](sbe44054.htm#fr_489) Or, the man, identified with the Sacrificer.\n\n[169:1](sbe44054.htm#fr_490) Perhaps the distinction. between 'pra _n_ a' and\n'ana' here is that of out-breathing and in-breathing.\n\n[169:2](sbe44054.htm#fr_491) Or, uniformly (gleichmassig).
