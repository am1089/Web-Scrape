Or it is metaphorical, on account of their not knowing the Self. For thus\nScripture declares.\n\nHe who performs sacrifices, and so on, and thus does not know the Self, is\nhere below and in yonder world a mere\n\np. 589\n\nmeans of enjoyment for the devas. He serves them here, by propitiating them\nwith sacrifices, and so on; and when the gods, pleased with his service, have\ntaken him up into yonder world, he there is a common means of enjoyment for\nthem (since they are gratified by the presence of a faithful servant). That\nthose not knowing the Self serve and benefit the gods, Scripture explicitly\ndeclares, 'He is like a beast for the devas' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10). Sm _ri_\nti also declares, that while those who know the Self attain to Brahman, those\nwho do not know it are means of enjoyment for the devas, 'To the gods go the\nworshippers of the gods, and they that are devoted to me go to me' (Bha. Gi.\nVII, 23). When Scripture speaks of the soul being eaten by the gods, it\ntherefore only means that the soul is to them a source of enjoyment. That\neating the soul means no more than satisfaction with it, may also be inferred\nfrom the following scriptural passage, 'The gods in truth do not eat nor do\nthey drink; by the mere sight of that am _ri_ ta they are satisfied.'--It thus\nremains a settled conclusion that the soul moves enveloped by the subtle\nrudiments of the elements.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the\nobtaining of another body.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 8.
