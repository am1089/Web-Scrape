With\nwithered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast\ndeep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds.\n\nThey know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl-fishers dive\nfor pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and\nscatter them again. They seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to\ncast nets.\n\nThe sea surges up with laughter, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach.\nDeath-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a\nmother while rocking her baby's cradle. The sea plays with children, and pale\ngleams the smile of the sea-beach.\n\nOn the seashore of endless worlds children meet. Tempest roams in the pathless\nsky, ships are wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and children\nplay. On the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Source](cm05.htm)\n\n"
