XI, 32), 'Thou\nart the Purishya 1,'--that is, 'Thou art favourable to cattle; all-\nsupporting,'--for he (Agni) indeed supports everything here;--'Atharvan was\nthe first that kindled thee, O Agni!'--Atharvan doubtless is the breath, and\nthe breath indeed churned him out (produced him) at first: 'Thou art that Agni\nwho was produced at first,' this he means to say; and that same (Agni) he thus\nmakes it (the lump) to be.\n\n6:4:2:22\\. He then takes hold of it with the (right) hand and spade on the\nright side; and with the (left) hand on the left side, with, 'From the lotus\nAtharvan churned thee forth,'--the lotus doubtless means the waters, and\nAtharvan is the breath; and the breath indeed churned him (Agni, the fire) out\nof the waters at first;--'from the head of every offerer 2,'--that is, 'from\nthe head of this All (universe).'\n\np. 218\n\n6:4:2:33\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 33; _Ri_ k S. VI, 16, 14] 'Also the sage Dadhya _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ , the son of Atharvan, kindled thee;'--Dadhya _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ , the \xc3\x82tharvana,\ndoubtless is speech; and he did kindle him therefrom;--'as the V _ri_ tra-\nslayer, the breaker of strongholds,'--V _ri_ tra is evil, thus: 'as the slayer\nof evil, the breaker of strongholds.'\n\n6:4:2:44\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 34; _Ri_ k S. VI, 16, 15] 'Also Pathya, the bull,\nkindled thee, as the greatest slayer of enemies,'--Pathya, the bull, doubtless\nis the Mind, and he did kindle him therefrom;--'as a winner of wealth in every\nbattle,'--as the text, so its meaning.\n\n6:4:2:55\\. With Gayatri verses (he performs),--the Gayatri is the vital air:\nhe thus lays vital air into him. With three (verses);--there are three vital\nairs, the out-breathing, the in-breathing, and the through-breathing: these he\nthus lays into him. These (verses) consist of nine feet, for there are nine\nvital airs, seven in the head, and two downward ones: these he thus lays into\nhim.\n\n6:4:2:66\\. And these two following ones are Trish _t_ ubhs,--(Va _g_. S. XI,\n35, 36; _Ri_ k S. III, 29, 8; II, 9, 1). Now, the Trish _t_ ubh is the body\n(self): it is his (Agni's) body he makes up by means of these two\n\np. 219\n\n[paragraph continues] (verses). 'Seat thee, O Hot _ri_ , in thine own place,\nthou, the mindful,'--the Hot _ri_ , doubtless, is Agni; and this, the black\nantelope skin, is indeed his own place; 'the mindful,' that is, 'the wise\none;'--'establish the sacrifice in the seat of the good work!'--the seat of\nthe good work doubtless is the black antelope skin;--'god-gladdening, thou\nshalt worship the gods with offering!'--that is, 'being a god, gratifying the\ngods, thou shalt worship (them) with offering;'--'Bestow, O Agni, great vigour\nupon the Sacrificer!'--thereby he implores a blessing upon the Sacrificer.\n\n6:4:2:77\\. 'The Hot _ri_ , in the Hot _ri_ 's seat, the knowing,'--the Hot\n_ri_ , doubtless, is Agni; the Hot _ri_ 's seat is the black antelope skin;\nand the knowing 1 means the wise one;--'the impetuous and glowing one, of\ngreat power, hath sat down,'--that is, the impetuous and shining one, of great\npower, has sat down;--'the guardian of undisturbed rites, the most wealthy,'--\nfor he indeed is the guardian of undisturbed rites, and the most\nwealthy;--'the bearer of thousands, the brilliant-tongued Agni,'--a thousand\nmeans all, thus, 'the all-bearer, the brilliant-tongued Agni.' With two Trish\n_t_ ubh (verses) relating to Agni (he performs): the meaning of this has been\ntold.\n\n6:4:2:88\\. Then there is this last B _ri_ hati verse, for this (fire-altar)\nwhen completely built up becomes like the B _ri_ hati (the great) metre:\nwhatlike seed is infused into the womb, suchlike is (the child) born; and\nbecause he now makes this verse a B _ri_ hati,\n\np. 220\n\ntherefore this (altar) when completely built up becomes like the B _ri_ hati.\n\n6:4:2:99\\. [Va _g_. S. XI, 37; _Ri_ k S. I, 36, 9] 'Seat thee, thou art\ngreat,'--he now causes the infused seed to establish itself, whence the seed\ninfused into the womb establishes itself;--'burn thou, best gladdener of the\ngods!'--that is, 'shine thou, best gladdener of the gods; send forth, O Agni,\nworthy partaker of the offering, thy showy, ruddy smoke!' for when he (Agni)\nis kindled, he sends forth his ruddy smoke,--the showy, for it, as it were,\nshows itself.\n\n6:4:2:1010\\. These (verses) amount to six,--six seasons are a year, and Agni\nis the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does\nthis become. And what comes to be like the year, comes to be like the B _ri_\nhati; for the year is the B _ri_ hati,--twelve full moons, twelve eighth days\n[1](sbe4139.htm#fn_443) (of the fortnight of waning moon), twelve new moons,\nthat makes thirty-six, and the B _ri_ hati consists of thirty-six syllables.\nHe takes it (the lump of clay) from the right (south) to the left (north) side\n(of the hole), for from the right side seed is infused into the womb; and this\n(hole) now is his (Agni's) womb. He takes it thither without stopping, so as\nnot to stop the seed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[217:1](sbe4138.htm#fr_441) See [p. 201](sbe4134.htm#page_201), note\n[1](sbe4134.htm#fn_415).\n\n[217:2](sbe4138.htm#fr_442) ? Or, of every priest (vi _s_ vasya vaghata _h_ ).\nThere is nothing to p. 218 show how the author of this part of the Brahma _n_\na interprets 'vaghat.' Cf. [VI, 4, 3, 10](sbe4139.htm#6:4:3:10).--Professor\nLudwig ( _Ri_ k S. VI, 16, 13) translates, 'from the head of the priest Vi _s_\nva.' Mahidhara offers several interpretations, according to which 'vaghata _h_\n' may either be taken as nom. plur., the verb being again supplied in the\nplural,--'the priests churned thee out from the head of the universe,' or 'the\npriests of the universe (or all priests) churned thee out,'--or 'vaghata _h_ '\nmay be ablative sing., like 'murdhna _h_ ,' qualifying 'pushkarat,'--from the\nlotus, the head, the leader (or, starter, vahakat) of the universe.\n\n[219:1](sbe4138.htm#fr_443) Thus the author evidently interprets 'vidana _h_\n,' instead of being found,' 'se trouvant,' as is its real meaning.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 4, 3.
