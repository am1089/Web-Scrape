I should sail the seven seas and\nthe thirteen rivers of fairyland.\n\nBut, mother, you won't weep for me in a corner.\n\nI am not going into the forest like Ramachandra to come back only after\nfourteen years.\n\nI shall become the prince of the story, and fill my boat with whatever I like.\n\nI shall take my friend Ashu with me. We shall sail merrily across the seven\nseas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland.\n\nWe shall set sail in the early morning light.\n\nWhen at noontide you are bathing at the pond, we shall be in the land of a\nstrange king.\n\nWe shall pass the ford of Tirpurni, and leave behind us the desert of\nTepantar.\n\nWhen we come back it will be getting dark, and I shall tell you of all that we\nhave seen.\n\nI shall cross the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Further Bank](cm23.htm)\n\n"
