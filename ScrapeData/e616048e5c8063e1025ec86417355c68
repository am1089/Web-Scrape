Verily, in the beginning this (universe) was, as it were 3,\nneither non-existent nor existent; in\n\np. 375\n\nthe beginning this (universe), indeed, as it were, existed and did not exist:\nthere was then only that Mind.\n\n10:5:3:22\\. Wherefore it has been said by the _Ri_ shi ( _Ri_ g-veda X, 129,\n1), 'There was then neither the non-existent nor the existent;' for Mind was,\nas it were, neither existent nor non-existent.\n\n10:5:3:33\\. This Mind, when created, wished to become manifest,--more defined\n1, more substantial: it sought after a self (body) 2. It practised austerity\n3: it acquired consistency 4. It then beheld thirty-six thousand Arka-fires 5\nof its own self, composed of mind, built up of mind: mentally 6 alone they\nwere established (on sacrificial hearths) and mentally\n\np. 376\n\nbuilt up 1; mentally the cups (of Soma) were drawn thereat mentally they\nchanted, and mentally they recited on (near) them,--whatever rite is performed\nat the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed\nmentally only, as a mental performance, on those (fires or fire-altars)\ncomposed of mind, and built up of mind. And whatever it is that (living)\nbeings here conceive in their mind that was done regarding those (mental Agnis\n2):--they establish them (on the hearths) and build them up (as fire-altars);\nthey draw the cups for them; they chant on (near) them and recite hymns on\nthem,--of that extent was the development of Mind, of that extent its\ncreation,--so great is Mind: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of these\nas great as that former (fire-altar) was.\n\n10:5:3:44\\. That Mind created Speech. This Speech, when created, wished to\nbecome manifest,--more defined, more substantial: it sought after a self. It\npractised austerity: it acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand\nArka-fires of its own self, composed of speech, built up of speech: with\nspeech they were established, and with speech built up; with speech the cups\nwere drawn thereat; with speech they chanted, and with speech they recited on\nthem--whatever rite is performed at the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite\nthere is, that was\n\np. 377\n\nperformed by speech alone, as a vocal performance, on those (fires) composed\nof speech, and built up of speech. And whatever beings here speak by speech\nthat was done regarding those (fires): they establish them and build them up;\nthey draw the cups for them; they chant on them and recite hymns on them,--of\nthat extent was the development of Speech, of that extent its creation,--so\ngreat is Speech: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of these as great as\nthat former (fire-altar) was.\n\n10:5:3:55\\. That Speech created the Breath. This Breath, when created, wished\nto become manifest,--more defined, more substantial: it sought after a self.\nIt practised austerity: it acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand\nArka-fires of its own self, composed of breath, built up of breath: with\nbreath they were established, and with breath built up; with breath the cups\nwere drawn thereat; with breath they chanted and with breath they recited on\nthem,--whatever rite is performed at the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite\nthere is, that was performed by breath alone, as a breathing-performance, on\nthose (fires) composed of breath, and built up of breath. And whatever beings\nhere breathe with breath that was done regarding those (fires):--they\nestablish them, and build them up; they draw the cups for them; they chant on\nthem and recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of Breath,\nof that extent was its creation,--so great is Breath: thirty-six thousand\nArka-fires; and each of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.\n\n10:5:3:66\\. That Breath created the Eye. This Eye, when created, wished to\nbecome manifest,--more\n\np. 378\n\ndefined, more substantial: it sought after a self. It practised austerity: it\nacquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand Arka-fires of its own\nself, composed of the eye, built up of the eye: by means of the eye they were\nestablished, and by means of the eye built up; by the eye the cups were drawn\nthereat; by means of the eye they chanted and recited hymns on them,--whatever\nrite is performed as the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that\nwas performed by the eye alone, as an eye-performance, on those (fires)\ncomposed of eye, and built up of the eye. And whatever beings here see with\nthe eye that was done regarding those (fires):they establish them and build\nthem up; they draw the cups for them; they chant on them and recite hymns on\nthem,--of that extent was the development of the Eye, of that extent its\ncreation,--so great is the Eye: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of\nthese as great as that former (fire-altar) was.\n\n10:5:3:77\\. That Eye created the Ear. This Ear, when created, wished to become\nmanifest,--more defined, more substantial: it sought after a self. It\npractised austerity: it acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand\nArka-fires of its own self, composed of the ear, built up of the ear: by means\nof the ear they were established, and by means of the ear built up; by the ear\nthe cups were drawn thereat; by means of the ear they chanted and recited\nhymns on them,--whatever rite is performed at the sacrifice, whatever\nsacrificial rite there is, that was performed by the ear alone, as an ear-\nperformance, on those (fires) composed of ear, and built up of the ear. And\nwhatever beings here hear with the ear\n\np. 379\n\nthat was done regarding those (fires):--they establish them and build, them\nup; they draw the cups for them; they chant on them and recite hymns on them,\n--of that extent was the development of the Ear, of that extent its creation,\n--so great is the Ear: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of these as\ngreat as that former (fire-altar) was.\n\n10:5:3:88\\. That Ear created Work, and this condensed itself into the vital\nairs, into this compound, this composition of food 1; for incomplete is work\nwithout the vital airs, and incomplete are the vital airs without work.\n\n10:5:3:99\\. This Work, when created, wished to become manifest,--more defined,\nmore substantial: it sought after a self. It practised austerity: it acquired\nconsistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand Arka-fires of its own self,\ncomposed of work, built up of (or by) work: by work they were established, and\nby work built up; by work the cups were drawn thereat; by work they chanted\nand recited hymns on them,--whatever rite is performed at the sacrifice,\nwhatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed by work alone, as a\nwork-performance, on those (fires) composed of work, and built up of work. And\nwhatever beings here work by work that was done regarding those (fires);--they\nestablish them and build them up; they draw the cups for them; they chant on\nthem and recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of Work, of\nthat\n\np. 380\n\nextent its creation,--so great is Work: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and\neach of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.\n\n10:5:3:1010\\. That Work created the Fire,--Fire, doubtless, is more manifest\nthan Work, for by work (sacrificial performance) they produce it, and by work\nthey kindle it.\n\n10:5:3:1111\\. This Fire, when created, wished to become manifest,--more\ndefined, more substantial: it sought after a self. It practised austerity 1:\nit acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand Arka-fires of its own\nself, composed of fire, built up of fire: with fire they were established, and\nwith fire built up; with fire the cups were drawn thereat; with fire they\nchanted and recited hymns on them;--whatever rite is performed at the\nsacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed with fire\nalone, as a fire-performance, on those (fires) composed of fire, and built up\nof fire. And whatever fire beings here kindle that was done regarding those\n(fires):--they establish them and build them up; they draw the cups for them;\nthey chant on them and recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the\ndevelopment of Fire, of that extent its creation,--so great is Fire: thirty-\nsix thousand Arka-fires; and each of these as great as that former (fire-\naltar) was.\n\n10:5:3:1212\\. These fires (altars), in truth, are knowledge-built; and all\nbeings at all times build them for him who knows this, even whilst he is\nasleep: by knowledge alone these fires (altars) are indeed built for him who\nknows this.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[374:3](sbe4368.htm#fr_753) Saya _n_ a seems to take 'iva' here in the sense\nof 'eva,' as indeed it often has to be taken, especially in negative\nsentences.\n\n[375:1](sbe4368.htm#fr_754) Niruktatara _m_ nirukta _m_ _s_ abdanirva _k_ yam.\nSay.\n\n[375:2](sbe4368.htm#fr_755) Saya _n_ a also allows the interpretation, 'after\n(its source, or cause,) the (supreme) self,'--atmana _m_ svakara _n_ a _m_\nparamatmana _m_ svasvarupa _m_ va\xe0\xa4\xbdnvai _k_ k _h_ at. What seems, indeed,\nimplied in these esoteric lucubrations, is that meditation on the infinite is\nequivalent to all ceremonial rites which are supposed to be incessantly\nperformed for one so engaged, even during his sleep ([paragraph\n12](sbe4368.htm#10:5:3:12)).\n\n[375:3](sbe4368.htm#fr_756) I. e. intense meditation (paryalokanam), Say.? 'it\nbecame heated.'\n\n[375:4](sbe4368.htm#fr_757) Saya _n_ a apparently takes 'pramur _kh_ at' in\nthe sense of 'became great, or important,'--samu _k_ _kh_ ritam babhuva.\n\n[375:5](sbe4368.htm#fr_758) Saya _n_ a here takes 'arka' in the sense of 'ar\n_k_ aniya (worthy of veneration)', as, indeed, he did several times before;\nthough once he seems to call them 'agnyarka _h_ ,' as being the highest,\nmerely speculative or immaterial form of sacrificial fires or fire-altars\n(dhyeya agnaya _h_ ); cf. [X, 3, 4, 3](sbe4359.htm#10:3:4:3) seq.--The 36,000\nfires are calculated so as to be equal to the number of days in the life of\nthe perfect man living a hundred years ([X, 2, 6, 9](sbe4355.htm#10:2:6:9));\nthere being thus for each day of his life a (spiritual) sacrificial fire, a\nmental exercise or discipline, as Saya _n_ a expresses it,--tatraikasmin dine\n(agneya?) manov _ri_ tti _h_.\n\n[375:6](sbe4368.htm#fr_759) The text has everywhere the instrumental 'manasa,'\nwhich would imply either the agent, the instrument, or the material, as the\ncase might be.\n\n[376:1](sbe4368.htm#fr_760) That is, the ceremonies of Agnyadhana\n(establishment of the sacrificial fire) and Agni _k_ ayana (building of the\nfire-altar) were performed by means of these fires. Saya _n_ a remarks that\nthese rites were performed by the same 'beings (bhutani),' which are mentioned\nimmediately after, as would, indeed, appear to be the case from [paragraph\n12](sbe4368.htm#10:5:3:12).\n\n[376:2](sbe4368.htm#fr_761) Yat ki _m_ _k_ a bhutani manasa dhyayanti va _k_ a\nvadanti tai _h_ sa _m_ kalpavadanadibhir eva tesham agninam kara _n_ am. Say.\n\n[379:1](sbe4368.htm#fr_762) Saya _n_ a explains 'sa _m_ degham annasa _m_\ndeham' by 'annapra _n_ a _s_ raya _m_ _s_ ariram,'--svayam asa _m_ deham a _s_\narira _m_ sat karma pra _n_ annayor anyonyasaha _k_ aryad abhiv _ri_ ddhi _m_\nvyatirekam makhyenaha, ak _ri_ tsnam &c. Saya _n_ a would thus take 'sa _m_\ndegha' as equivalent to the later 'deha' (body), and in no depreciatory sense.\n\n[380:1](sbe4368.htm#fr_763) Or, fervid devotion; though perhaps the physical\nsense of 'it became heated' would suit better here.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 5, 4.
