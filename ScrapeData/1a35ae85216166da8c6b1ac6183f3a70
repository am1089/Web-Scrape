But on account of the indicatory mark supplied by their reflecting (i.e.\nby the reflection attributed to the elements), he (i.e. the Lord is the\ncreative principle abiding within the elements).\n\nA doubt here arises whether ether and the other elements do themselves send\nforth their effects, or if the highest Lord abiding within certain Selfs\nproduces, after reflection, certain effects.\n\nHere the purvapakshin maintains that the elements themselves send forth,\nbecause the texts speak of them as acting independently; compare, for\ninstance, 'from ether sprang air, from air fire,' &c. The objection that non-\nintelligent beings cannot enter on independent activity is invalidated by the\nfact that the elements also are spoken of in the sacred texts as endowed with\nintelligence, cf. for instance, 'fire thought,' 'water thought' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVI, 2, 3; 4).\n\nTo this we reply that the highest Lord himself abiding within certain Selfs\nsends forth, after reflection, certain effects.--Why?--On account of the\nindicatory marks. For\n\np. 25\n\ntexts such as 'he who dwells in the earth, and within the earth, whom the\nearth does not know, whose body the earth is and who rules the earth within'\nshow that the elements enter on their activity only if presided over by an\nintelligent principle. Texts such as 'He became sat and tyat' (which occurs in\nthe passage, 'he wished may I be many, may I grow forth,' Taitt. Up. 11, 6)\nand 'It made itself its Self' (i.e. the Self of everything which exists; II,\n7) show that he the highest Lord) is the Self of everything. The thinking and\nhearing which the texts attribute to water and fire must be viewed as due to\nthe fact of the highest Lord having entered them; for the passage, 'there is\nno other seer but he,' denies there being any other seer (thinker), and that\nwhich is (i.e. Brahman), in the character of seer (or thinker), constitutes\nthe subject-matter of the whole chapter; as we conclude from the introductory\npassage, 'It thought, may I be many, may I grow forth' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 3).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 14](sbe38015.htm)\n\n"
