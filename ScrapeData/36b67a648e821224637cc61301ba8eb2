And on account of the word (of the Veda).\n\nThe word of the Veda also proclaims the non-originatedness of ether; for it\ndeclares that 'air and ether (antariksha) are immortal' (B _ri_. Up. II, 3,\n3), and what is immortal cannot have an origin. Another scriptural passage\n('omnipresent and eternal like ether'), by comparing two attributes of\nBrahman, viz. omnipresence and eternity with the other, intimates that those\nqualities belong to the ether\n\np. 7\n\nalso; in which case no beginning can be attributed to it. Other passages to be\nquoted in this connexion are, 'As this ether is infinite, so the Self is to be\nknown as infinite;' and 'Brahman has the ether for its body, the ether is the\nSelf.' For if the ether had a beginning, it could not be predicated of Brahman\n(as is done in the last passage), as we predicate blueness of a lotus ('the\nlotus is blue'). Hence we understand that the eternal Brahman is of the nature\nas ether.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 5](sbe38006.htm)\n\n"
