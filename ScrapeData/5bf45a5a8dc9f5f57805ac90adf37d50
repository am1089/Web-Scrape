(Brahman can)not (be the cause of the world) on account of the difference\nof character of that, (viz. the world); and its being such, (i.e. different\nfrom Brahman) (we learn) from Scripture.\n\nThe objections, founded on Sm _ri_ ti, against the doctrine of Brahman being\nthe efficient and the material cause of this world have been refuted; we now\nproceed to refute those founded on Reasoning.--But (to raise an objection at\nthe outset) how is there room for objections founded on Reasoning after the\nsense of the sacred texts has once been settled? The sacred texts are\ncertainly to be considered absolutely authoritative with regard to Brahman as\nwell as with regard to religious duty (dharma),--(To this the purvapakshin\nreplies), The analogy between Brahman and dharma would hold good if the matter\nin hand were to be known through the holy texts only, and could not be\napproached by the other means of right knowledge also. In the case of\nreligious duties, i.e. things to be done, we indeed entirely depend on\nScripture. But now we are concerned with Brahman which is an accomplished\nexisting thing, and in the case of accomplished things there is room for other\nmeans of right knowledge also, as, for instance, the case of earth and the\nother elements shows. And just as in the case of several conflicting\nscriptural passages we explain all of them in such a manner as to make them\naccord with one, so _S_ ruti, if in conflict with other means of right\nknowledge, has to be bent so as to accord with the letter. Moreover,\nReasoning, which enables us to infer something not actually perceived in\nconsequence of its having a certain equality of attributes with what is\nactually perceived, stands nearer to perception than _S_ ruti which conveys\nits sense by tradition merely. And the knowledge\n\np. 300\n\nof Brahman which discards Nescience and effects final release terminates in a\nperception (viz. the intuition--sakshatkara--of Brahman), and as such must be\nassumed to have a seen result (not an unseen one like dharma) 1. Moreover, the\nscriptural passage, 'He is to be heard, to be thought,' enjoins thought in\naddition to hearing, and thereby shows that Reasoning also is to be resorted\nto with regard to Brahman. Hence an objection founded on Reasoning is set\nforth, 'Not so, on account of the difference of nature of this (effect)'--The\nVedantic opinion that the intelligent Brahman is the material cause of this\nworld is untenable because the effect would in that case be of an altogether\ndifferent character from the cause. For this world, which the Vedantin\nconsiders as the effect of Brahman, is perceived to be non-intelligent and\nimpure, consequently different in character from Brahman; and Brahman again is\ndeclared by the sacred texts to be of a character different from the world,\nviz. intelligent and pure. But things of an altogether different character\ncannot stand to each other in the relation of material cause and effect. Such\neffects, for instance, as golden ornaments do not have earth for their\nmaterial cause, nor is\n\np. 301\n\ngold the material cause of earthen vessels; but effects of an earthy nature\noriginate from earth and effects of the nature of gold from gold. In the same\nmanner this world, which is non-intelligent and comprises pleasure, pain, and\ndulness, can only be the effect of a cause itself non-intelligent and made up\nof pleasure, pain, and dulness; but not of Brahman which is of an altogether\ndifferent character. The difference in character of this world from Brahman\nmust be understood to be due to its impurity and its want of intelligence. It\nis impure because being itself made up of pleasure, pain, and dulness, it is\nthe cause of delight, grief, despondency, &c., and because it comprises in\nitself abodes of various character such as heaven, hell, and so on. It is\ndevoid of intelligence because it is observed to stand to the intelligent\nprinciple in the relation of subserviency, being the instrument of its\nactivity. For the relation of subserviency of one thing to another is not\npossible on the basis of equality; two lamps, for instance, cannot be said to\nbe subservient to each other (both being equally luminous).--But, it will be\nsaid, an intelligent instrument also might be subservient to the enjoying\nsoul; just as an intelligent servant is subservient to his master.--This\nanalogy, we reply, does not hold good, because in the case of servant and\nmaster also only the non-intelligent element in the former is subservient to\nthe intelligent master. For a being endowed with intelligence subserves\nanother intelligent being only with the non-intelligent part belonging to it,\nviz. its internal organ, sense organs, &c.; while in so far as it is\nintelligent itself it acts neither for nor against any other being. For the Sa\n_n_ khyas are of opinion that the intelligent beings (i.e. the souls) are\nincapable of either taking in or giving out anything 1, and are non-active.\nHence that only which is devoid of intelligence can be an instrument. Nor  2\nis there anything\n\np. 302\n\nto show that things like pieces of wood and clods of earth are of an\nintelligent nature; on the contrary, the dichotomy of all things which exist\ninto such as are intelligent and such as are non-intelligent is well\nestablished. This world therefore cannot have its material cause in Brahman\nfrom which it is altogether different in character.--Here somebody might argue\nas follows. Scripture tells us that this world has originated from an\nintelligent cause; therefore, starting from the observation that the\nattributes of the cause survive in the effect, I assume this whole world to be\nintelligent. The absence of manifestation of intelligence (in this world) is\nto be ascribed to the particular nature of the modification 1. Just as\nundoubtedly intelligent beings do not manifest their intelligence in certain\nstates such as sleep, swoon, &c., so the intelligence of wood and earth also\nis not manifest (although it exists). In consequence of this difference\nproduced by the manifestation and non-manifestation of intelligence (in the\ncase of men, animals, &c., on the one side, and wood, stones, &c. on the other\nside), and in consequence of form, colour, and the like being present in the\none case and absent in the other, nothing prevents the instruments of action\n(earth, wood, &c.) from standing to the souls in the relation of a subordinate\nto a superior thing, although in reality both are equally of an intelligent\nnature. And just as such substances as flesh, broth, pap, and the like may,\nowing to their individual differences, stand in the relation of mutual\nsubserviency, although fundamentally they are all of the same nature, viz.\nmere modifications of earth, so it will be in the case under discussion also,\nwithout there being done any violence to the well-known distinction (of beings\nintelligent and non-intelligent).--This reasoning--the purvapakshin replies--\nif valid might remove to a certain extent that difference of character between\n\np. 303\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman and the world which is due to the circumstance\nof the one being intelligent and the other non-intelligent; there would,\nhowever, still remain that other difference which results from the fact that\nthe one is pure and the other impure. But in reality the argumentation of the\nobjector does not even remove the first-named difference; as is declared in\nthe latter part of the Sutra, 'And its being such we learn from Scripture.'\nFor the assumption of the intellectuality of the entire world--which is\nsupported neither by perception nor by inference, &c.--must be considered as\nresting on Scripture only in so far as the latter speaks of the world as\nhaving originated from an intelligent cause; but that scriptural statement\nitself is contradicted by other texts which declare the world to be 'of such a\nnature,' i.e. of a nature different from that of its material cause. For the\nscriptural passage, 'It became that which is knowledge and that which is\ndevoid of knowledge' (Taitt. Up. II, 6), which teaches that a certain class of\nbeings is of a non-intelligent nature intimates thereby that the non-\nintelligent world is different from the intelligent Brahman.--But--somebody\nmight again object--the sacred texts themselves sometimes speak of the\nelements and the bodily organs, which are generally considered to be devoid of\nintelligence, as intelligent beings. The following passages, for instance,\nattribute intelligence to the elements. 'The earth spoke;' 'The waters spoke'\n( _S_ at. Br. VI, 1, 3, 2; 4); and, again, 'Fire thought;' 'Water thought' (\n_Kh_. Up. VI, 2, 3; 4). Other texts attribute intelligence to the bodily\norgans, 'These pra _n_ as when quarrelling together as to who was the best\nwent to Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. VI, 1, 7); and, again, 'They said to Speech: Do\nthou sing out for us' (B _ri_. Up. I, 3, 2).--To this objection the\npurvapakshin replies in the following Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[300:1](sbe34143.htm#fr_268) The cognition of Brahman terminates in an act of\nanubhava; hence as it has been shown that reasoning is more closely connected\nwith anubhava than _S_ ruti is, we have the right to apply reasoning to _S_\nruti.--\xc3\x82nanda Giri comments on the passage from anubhavavasanam as follows:\nbrahmasakshatkarasya mokshopayataya pradhanyat tatra _s_ abdad api parokshago\n_k_ arad aparoksharthasadharmyago _k_ aras tarko#ntara _n_ gam iti tasyaiva\nbalavatvam ity artha _h_.
