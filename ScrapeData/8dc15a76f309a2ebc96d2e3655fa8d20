[1894], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n5:4:1\n\n### FOURTH ADHY\xc3\x82YA. FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n5:4:1:11\\. He puts a piece of copper 1 into the mouth of a long-haired man,\nwith (Va _g_. S. X, 10), 'Removed by sacrifice are the mordacious.' For verily\nhe who performs the Ra _g_ asuya escapes all kinds of death, all murderous\nblows, and old age alone is his death: hence whatever kind of death, whatever\nmurderous blow there is, past that he now guides him, as past the mordacious\nones.\n\n5:4:1:22\\. And as to why it is of a long-haired man,--such a long-haired man\nis neither woman nor man; for being a male, he is not a woman, and being\nlonghaired (a eunuch), he is not a man. And copper (or bronze) is neither iron\nnor gold; and those mordacious ones (snakes) are neither worms nor non-worms.\nAnd as to its being copper,--reddish\n\np. 91\n\nto be sure are mordacious ones: therefore (he throws it in the face) of a\nlong-haired man.\n\n5:4:1:33\\. He then makes him ascend the regions, with (Va _g_. S. X, 10-14),\n'Ascend thou the East! May the Gayatri (metre) protect thee, the Rathantara-\nsaman, the threefold stoma, the spring season, the Priesthood, that precious\ntreasure!'\n\n5:4:1:44\\. 'Ascend thou the South! May the Trish _t_ ubh protect thee, the B\n_ri_ hat-saman, the fifteenfold stoma, the summer season, the Knighthood, that\nprecious treasure!'\n\n5:4:1:55\\. 'Ascend thou the West! May the _G_ agati protect thee, the Vairupa-\nsaman, the seventeenfold stoma, the rainy season, the Peasantry, that precious\ntreasure!'\n\n5:4:1:66\\. 'Ascend thou the North! May the Anush _t_ ubh protect thee, the\nVaira _g_ a-saman, the twenty-onefold stoma, the autumn season, fruit, that\nprecious treasure!'\n\n5:4:1:77\\. 'Ascend thou the upper region! May the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti protect thee, the\nSakvara and Raivata-samans, the thrice-ninefold and the three and thirtyfold\nstomas, the winter and dewy season, spiritual lustre, that precious treasure!'\n\n5:4:1:88\\. And as to why he makes him ascend the quarters,--that is a form of\nthe seasons: it is the seasons, the year, that he thereby makes him ascend;\nand having ascended the seasons, the year, he is high, high above everything\nhere, and everything here is below him.\n\n5:4:1:99\\. On the hind part of the tiger's skin 1 a piece of\n\np. 92\n\nlead is laid down. He kicks it off with his foot, with (Va _g_. S. X, 14),\n'Kicked off is Namu _k_ i's head!' Now there was once an \xc3\x82sura, Namu _k_ i by\nname. Indra knocked him down, and trod with his foot upon him. And in that he,\nthus trodden upon, bulged out, that (is the origin of) a rupture. He tore off\nhis head with his foot, and therefrom sprang a goblin (Rakshas). That one kept\ncalling out to him, 'Whither art thou going? Where wilt thou rid thyself of\nme?'\n\n5:4:1:1010\\. He beat it off with (a disk of) lead: hence lead is soft, for it\nhas lost its spring, as it beat off (the goblin) with all its might. Hence\nalso, while being like gold, it is not worth anything; for it has lost its\nspring, as it beat off (the goblin) with all its might. And so, indeed, he\n(Indra) thereby beat off the fiends, the Rakshas; and in like manner this one\n(the king) thereby beats off the fiends, the Rakshas.\n\n5:4:1:1111\\. He then makes him step upon the tiger's skin, with (Va _g_. S. X,\n15), 'Thou art Soma's beauty;'--For because when Soma flowed through Indra, he\n(Indra) thereupon became a tiger, and therefore he is Soma's beauty: this is\nwhy he says, 'Thou art Soma's beauty;'--'May my beauty be like unto thine!'--\nThe tiger's beauty he thereby bestows upon him: therefore he says, 'May my\nbeauty be like unto thine!'\n\n5:4:1:1212\\. Below (the king's foot) he throws a (small) gold plate, with,\n'Save (him) from death!'--Gold is immortal life: he thus takes his stand on\nimmortal life.\n\n5:4:1:1313\\. Then there is (another) gold plate, perforated either with a\nhundred, or with nine, holes. If with\n\np. 93\n\na hundred holes,--man here lives up to a hundred (years), and has a hundred\nenergies, a hundred powers; therefore it is perforated with a hundred holes.\nAnd if with nine holes,--there are in man those nine vital airs: therefore it\nis perforated with nine holes.\n\n5:4:1:1414\\. That (gold plate) he lays upon his head, with, 'Might thou art,\nvictory thou art, immortality thou art!' Gold being immortal life, he thus\nlays immortal life into him. And as to why there are gold plates on both\nsides,--gold being immortal life,--he thus encloses him on both sides with\nimmortal life: this is why there are gold plates on both sides.\n\n5:4:1:1515\\. He then lifts up his arms, with (Va _g_. S. X, 16 1), 'Golden-\nbodied, ye two lords rise like the sun: mount ye the chariot, O Mitra and Varu\n_n_ a, and thence behold Aditi and Diti!' Mitra and Varu _n_ a verily are the\ntwo arms, and the chariot (-seat) is the man: therefore he says, 'Mount ye the\nchariot, O Mitra and Varu _n_ a!'--'thence behold Aditi and Diti!' By this he\nmeans to say, 'See ye your own (property) and that of others''\n\n5:4:1:1616\\. Let him not lift up (the king's arms) with that one, but let him\nrather lift them up with, 'Thou art Mitra, thou art Varu _n_ a;' for Mitra-\nVaru _n_ a are the two arms, and by his arms the Ra _g_ anya belongs to Mitra\nand Varu _n_ a: let him therefore lift up his arms with, 'Thou art Mitra, thou\nart Varu _n_ a.'\n\np. 94\n\n5:4:1:1717\\. And as to why he anoints him (standing) with upstretched\narms;--those arms in truth are the Ra _g_ anya's power, and power also is that\ncollected essence of the waters wherewith he now anoints him: 'Lest that\npower, the collected essence of the waters, weigh down (paralyze) this power\nof mine, the arms,' thus he thinks, and therefore he anoints him (standing)\nwith upstretched arms.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[90:1](sbe4118.htm#fr_184) Lohayasa, literally, 'red metal,' apparently either\ncopper, or an alloy of copper and some other metal,--The eunuch is sitting in\nthe Sadas.\n\n[91:1](sbe4118.htm#fr_185) This was spread out in front of the Maitravaru _n_\na's hearth, see [V, 3, 5, 3](sbe4117.htm#5:3:5:3).\n\n[93:1](sbe4118.htm#fr_186) In _Ri_ k S.
