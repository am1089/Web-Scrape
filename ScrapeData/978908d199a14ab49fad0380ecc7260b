I had three when I commenced\n\np. lxxiv\n\nthe work, two in the Devanagari, and one in the Bengali character: a fourth,\nfrom the west of India, was given to me by Major Jervis, when some progress\nhad been made: and in conducting the latter half of the translation through\nthe press, I have compared it with three other copies in the library of the\nEast India Company. All these copies closely agree; presenting no other\ndifferences than occasional varieties of reading, owing chiefly to the\ninattention or inaccuracy of the transcriber. Four of the copies were\naccompanied by a commentary, essentially the sane, although occasionally\nvarying; and ascribed, in part at least, to two different scholiasts. The\nannotations on the first two books and the fifth are in two MSS. said to be\nthe work of \xc5\x9aridhara Yati, the disciple of Parananda, and who is therefore the\nsame as \xc5\x9aridhara Swami, the commentator on the Bhagavata. In the other three\nbooks these two MSS. concur with other two in naming the commentator\nRatnagarbha Bhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a, who in those two is the author of the notes on the\nentire work. The introductory verses of his comment specify him to be the\ndisciple of Vidya-vachaspati, the son of Hiran\xcc\x81yagarbha, and grandson of\nMadhava, who composed his commentary by desire of Suryakara, son of Ratinath,\nMi\xc5\x9bra, son of Chandrakara, hereditary ministers of some sovereign who is not\nparticularized. In the illustrations which are attributed to these different\nwriters there is so much conformity, that one or other is largely indebted to\nhis predecessor. They both refer to earlier commentaries. \xc5\x9aridhara cites the\nworks of Chit-sukha-yoni and others, both more extensive and more concise;\nbetween which, his own, which he terms \xc3\x81tma- or Swa-prakasa, 'self-\nilluminator,' holds an intermediate character. Ratnagarbha entitles his,\nVaishn\xcc\x81avakuta chandrika, 'the moonlight of devotion to Vishn\xcc\x81u.' The dates of\nthese commentators are not ascertainable, as far as I am aware, from any of\nthe particulars which they have specified.\n\nIn the notes which I have added to the translation, I have been desirous\nchiefly of comparing the statements of the text with those of other Puran\xcc\x81as,\nand pointing out the circumstances in which they differ or agree; so as to\nrender the present publication a sort of concordance to the whole, as it is\nnot very probable that many of them will be\n\np. lxxv\n\npublished or translated. The Index that follows has been made sufficiently\ncopious to answer the purposes of a mythological and historical dictionary, as\nfar as the Puran\xcc\x81as, or the greater number of them, furnish, materials.\n\nIn rendering the text into English, I have adhered to it as literally as was\ncompatible with some regard to the usages of English composition. In general\nthe original presents few difficulties. The style of the Puran\xcc\x81as is very\ncommonly humble and easy, and the narrative is plainly and unpretendingly\ntold. In the addresses to the deities, in the expatiations upon the divine\nnature, in the descriptions of the universe, and in argumentative and\nmetaphysical discussion, there occur passages in which the difficulty arising\nfrom the subject itself is enhanced by the brief and obscure manner in which\nit is treated. On such occasions I derived much aid from the commentary, but\nit is possible that I may have sometimes misapprehended and misrepresented the\noriginal; and it is also possible that I may have sometimes failed to express\nits purport with sufficient precision to have made it intelligible. I trust,\nhowever, that this will not often be the case, and that the translation of the\nVishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a will be of service and of interest to the few, who in these\ntimes of utilitarian selfishness, conflicting opinion, party virulence, and\npolitical agitation, can find a restingplace for their thoughts in the\ntranquil contemplation of those yet living pictures of the ancient world which\nare exhibited by the literature and mythology of the Hindus.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Contents](vp033.htm)\n\n"
