The _Ri_ _k_ (veda) is this earth, the Saman (veda) is fire. This Saman\n(fire) rests on that _Ri_ _k_ (earth) 4. Therefore the Saman is sung as\nresting on the _Ri_ _k_.\n\np. 13\n\n[paragraph continues] Sa is this earth, ama is fire, and that makes Sama.\n\n2\\. The _Ri_ _k_ is the sky, the Saman air. This Saman (air) rests on that\n_Ri_ _k_ (sky). Therefore the Saman is sung as resting on the _Ri_ _k_. Sa is\nthe sky, ama the air, and that makes Sama.\n\n3\\. _Ri_ _k_ is heaven, Saman the sun. This Saman (sun) rests on that _Ri_ _k_\n(heaven). Therefore the Saman is sung as resting on the _Ri_ _k_. Sa is\nheaven, ama the sun, and that makes Sama.\n\n4\\. _Ri_ _k_ is the stars, Saman the moon. This Saman (moon) rests on that\n_Ri_ _k_ (stars). Therefore the Saman is sung as resting on the _Ri_ _k_. Sa\nis the stars, ama the moon, and that makes Sama.\n\n5\\. _Ri_ _k_ is the white light of the sun, Saman the blue exceeding darkness\n1 (in the sun). This Saman (darkness) rests on that _Ri_ _k_ (brightness).\nTherefore the Saman is sung as resting on the _Ri_ _k_.\n\n6\\. Sa is the white light of the sun, ama the blue exceeding darkness, and\nthat makes Sama.\n\nNow that golden 2 person, who is seen within the sun, with golden beard and\ngolden hair, golden altogether to the very tips of his nails,\n\n7\\. Whose eyes are like blue lotus's 3, his name is ut, for he has risen\n(udita) above all evil. He also who knows this, rises above all evil.\n\n8\\. _Ri_ _k_ and Saman are his joints, and therefore he is udgitha. And\ntherefore he who praises him\n\np. 14\n\n[paragraph continues] (the ut) is called the Ud-gat _ri_  1 (the out-singer).\nHe (the golden person, called ut) is lord of the worlds beyond that (sun), and\nof all the wishes of the Devas (inhabiting those worlds). So much with\nreference to the Devas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[12:4](sbe01027.htm#fr_96) The Sama verses are mostly taken from the Rig-veda.\n\n[13:1](sbe01027.htm#fr_97) The darkness which is seen by those who can\nconcentrate their sight on the sun.\n\n[13:2](sbe01027.htm#fr_98) Bright as gold.\n\n[13:3](sbe01027.htm#fr_99) The colour of the lotus is described by a\ncomparison with the Kapyasa, the seat of the monkey (kapip _ri_ sh _th_ anto\nyena upavi _s_ ati), It was probably a botanical name.\n\n[14:1](sbe01027.htm#fr_100) Name of the principal priest of the Sama-veda.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 7](sbe01028.htm)\n\n"
