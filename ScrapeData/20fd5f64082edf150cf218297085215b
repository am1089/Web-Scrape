He says, 'I have come for Brahma _k_ arya 2:' he thereby reports\nhimself to the Brahman. He says, 'Let me be a Brahma _k_ arin (student):' he\nthereby makes himself over to the Brahman. He (the teacher) then says, 'What\n(ka) is thy name?'--now Ka is Pra _g_ apati: he thus initiates him after\nmaking him one belonging to Pra _g_ apati.\n\n11:5:4:22\\. He then takes his (right) hand with, 'Indra's disciple thou art;\nAgni is thy teacher, I am thy teacher, O N.N.!'--now these are two most high\nand most powerful deities: it is to these two most high and most powerful\ndeities he commits him; and thus his disciple suffers no harm of any kind, nor\ndoes he who knows this 3.\n\n11:5:4:33\\. He then commits him to the beings:--'To Pra _g_ apati I commit\nthee, to the god Savit _ri_ I commit thee;'--now these are two most high and\nmost important deities: it is to these two most high and most important\ndeities he commits him; and thus his disciple suffers no harm of any kind, nor\ndoes he who knows this.\n\np. 87\n\n11:5:4:44\\. 'To the waters, to the plants I commit thee,'--he thus commits him\nto the waters and plants.--'To Heaven and Earth I commit thee,'--he thus\ncommits him to these two, heaven and earth, within which all this universe is\ncontained.--'To all beings I commit thee for security from injury,'--he thus\ncommits him to all beings for security from injury; and thus his disciple\nsuffers no harm of any kind, nor does he who knows this.\n\n11:5:4:55\\. 'Thou art a Brahma _k_ arin,' he says, and thus commits him to the\nBrahman;--'sip water!'--water, doubtless, means ambrosia: 'sip ambrosia' is\nthus what he tells him;--'do thy work!'--work, doubtless, means vigour: 'exert\nvigour' is thus what he tells him;--'put on fuel!'--'enkindle thy mind with\nfire, with holy lustre!' is what he thereby tells him;--'do not sleep 1!'--'do\nnot die' is what he thereby says to him;--'sip water!'--water means ambrosia:\n'sip ambrosia' is what he thus tells him. He thus encloses him on both sides\nwith ambrosia (the drink of immortality), and thus the Brahma _k_ arin suffers\nno harm of any kind, nor does he who knows this.\n\n11:5:4:66\\. He then recites to him (teaches him) the Savitri 2;--formerly,\nindeed, they taught this (verse) at the end of a year 3, thinking, 'Children,\nindeed, are\n\np. 88\n\nborn after being fashioned for a year 1: thus we lay speech (voice) into this\none as soon as he has been born.'\n\n11:5:4:77\\. Or after six months, thinking, 'There are six seasons in the year,\nand children are born after being fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech\ninto this one as soon as he has been born.'\n\n11:5:4:88\\. Or after twenty-four days, thinking, 'There are twenty-four half-\nmonths in the year, and children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus\nlay speech into this one as soon as he has been born.'\n\n11:5:4:99\\. Or after twelve days, thinking, 'There are twelve months in the\nyear, and children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into\nthis one as soon as he has been born.'\n\n11:5:4:1010\\. Or after six days, thinking, 'There are six seasons in the year,\nand children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into this\none as soon as he has been born.'\n\n11:5:4:1111\\. Or after three days, thinking, 'There are three seasons in the\nyear, and children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into\nthis one as soon as he has been born.'\n\n11:5:4:1212\\. Concerning this they also sing the verse,--'By laying his right\nhand on (the pupil), the teacher becomes pregnant (with him): in the third\n(night) he is born as a Brahma _n_ a with the Savitri 2.' Let him,\n\np. 89\n\nhowever, teach a Brahma _n_ a (the Savitri) at once, for the Brahma _n_ a\nbelongs to Agni, and Agni is born at once 1: therefore, he should teach the\nBrahma _n_ a at once.\n\n11:5:4:1313\\. Now some teach an Anush _t_ ubh Savitri, saying, 'The Anush _t_\nubh is speech: we thus lay speech into him.' But let him not do so; for if, in\nthat case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (student) has taken away\nhis (the teacher's) speech: he will become dumb;' then that would indeed be\nlikely to come to pass: let him therefore teach him that Gayatri Savitri.\n\n11:5:4:1414\\. And some recite it to him while he (the student) is standing or\nsitting on (the teacher's) right side; but let him not do this; for if, in\nthat case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (teacher) has born this\n(student) sideways, he will become averse to him;' then that would indeed be\nlikely to come to pass: let him therefore recite it in a forward (easterly)\ndirection to (the student) looking at him towards the west.\n\n11:5:4:1515\\. He (first) recites it by padas 2: there being three breathings,\nthe out-breathing, the up-breathing and the through-breathing; it is these he\nthus lays into him;--then by half-verses: there being these\n\np. 90\n\ntwo (principal) breathings, the out-breathing and the up-breathing 1, it is\nthe out-breathing and the up-breathing he thus lays into him;--then the whole\n(verse): there being this one vital air (in man), he thus lays the whole vital\nair into the whole of him.\n\n11:5:4:1616\\. As to this they say, 'When one has admitted a Brahma _n_ a to a\nterm of studentship, he should not carry on sexual intercourse, lest he should\ngenerate this Brahma _n_ a from shed seed; for, indeed, he who enters on a\nterm of studentship becomes an embryo.'\n\n11:5:4:1717\\. And concerning this they also say, 'He may nevertheless do so,\nif he chooses; for these creatures are of two kinds, divine and human,--these\nhuman creatures are born from the womb, and the divine creatures, being the\nmetres (verses of scripture), are born from the month: it is therefrom he (the\nteacher) produces him, and therefore he may do so (have intercourse) if he\nchooses.'\n\n11:5:4:1818\\. And they also say, 'He who is a Brahma _k_ arin should not eat\nhoney, lest he should reach the end of food, for honey, doubtless, is the\nutmost (supreme) essence of plants.' But _S_ vetaketu \xc3\x82ru _n_ eya, when eating\nhoney, whilst he was a student, said, 'This honey, in truth, is the remainder\n(essential part) of the triple science (the Vedas), and he, indeed, who has\nsuch a remainder, is an essence.' And, indeed, if a Brahma _k_ arin, knowing\nthis, eats honey, it is just as if he were to utter either a _Ri_ k-verse, or\nYa _g_ us-formula, or a Saman-tune: let him therefore eat freely of it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[86:1](sbe44028.htm#fr_283) With this chapter compare Paraskara G _ri_\nhyasutra II, 2, 17 seqq.; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana G _ri_ hyasutra I, 20 seqq.; _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana G _ri_ hyasutra II, 1 seqq.\n\n[86:2](sbe44028.htm#fr_284) That is, for religious (theological) studentship:\n'I have come to be a student.'--Saya _n_ a takes the aorist 'agam' in an\noptative sense 'may I enter (or obtain),'--brahma _k_ ari _n_ o bhavo brahma\n_k_ arya _m_ tad aga _m_ prapnuyam.\n\n[86:3](sbe44028.htm#fr_285) Vidusho\xe0\xa4\xbdpy etat phalam aha, na sa iti, evam\nuktartha _m_ yo veda _g_ anati so\xe0\xa4\xbdpy arti _m_ na prapnotity artha _h_ , Say.\n\n[87:1](sbe44028.htm#fr_286) 'Do not sleep in the daytime!'

III, 62, 10), see II, 3, 4, 39.\n\n[87:3](sbe44028.htm#fr_288) Saya _n_ a takes this in the sense of 'some only\nteach this (formula) a year after (or, after the first year),'--pura\npurvasminn upanayanad urdhvabhavini sa _m_ vatsarakale\xe0\xa4\xbdti _t_ e sati tam eta\n_m_ gayatrim anvahu _h_ , ke _k_ id a _k_ arya upadi _s_ anti.\n\n[88:1](sbe44028.htm#fr_289) Literally, made equal, or corresponding, to a\nyear,--Sa _m_ vatsaratmana kalena samyakpari _k_ _kh_ inna _h_ khalu garbha\nvyaktavayava _h_ santa _h_ pra _g_ ayante utpadyante; ata upanayananantaram a\n_k_ aryasamipe garbhavad ava _k_ _kh_ innas taduktaniyamanat sa _m_\nvatsarakala eva punar _g_ ayate, Say.\n\n[88:2](sbe44028.htm#fr_290) \xc3\x82 _k_ aryo ma _n_ avakam upaniya samipavartina\ntena garbhi bhavati garbhavan bhavati, ki _m_ k _ri_ tva, atmiya _m_ dakshi\n_n_ a _m_ hasta _m_ _s_ ishyamastaka p. 89 adhaya nikshipya; sa garbharupo ma\n_n_ avakas t _ri_ tiyasya _m_ ratrau vyatitaya _m_ _g_ ayate a _k_ aryad\nutpadyate, _g_ ata _s_ _k_ a a _k_ arye _n_ opadish _t_ aya savitrya sahita\nsan brahma _n_ o bhavati savitrirupa _m_ _k_ a brahmadhita iti brahma _n_ a\niti vyutpatti _h_ , brahma _n_ a _g_ atitvam asya sampannam ity artha _h_ ,\nSay.\n\n[89:1](sbe44028.htm#fr_291) Viz. immediately on the 'churning-sticks' being\nset in motion.\n\n[89:2](sbe44028.htm#fr_292) The Gayatri (Savitri) consists of three\noctosyllabic padas, forming two half-verses of two and one pada respectively;\nwhilst an Anush _t_ ubh (Savitri) would consist of four octosyllabic padas,\ntwo of which make a half-verse.\n\n[90:1](sbe44028.htm#fr_293) That is, the breath of the mouth, and that of the\nnostrils.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 5, 5.
