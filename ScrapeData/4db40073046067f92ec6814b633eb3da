If a student has approached a woman, he shall slay in the forest, in a\nplace where four roads meet 1\n\np. 118\n\n[paragraph continues] (kindling) a common fire, an ass for the Rakshas (the\ngoblins),\n\n2\\. Or he may offer an oblation of rice ( _k_ aru) to Nir _ri_ ti (the goddess\nof hell).\n\n3\\. Let him throw into the fire (four oblations consisting) of that\n(sacrificial food, saying), To Lust svaha; to him who follows his lust svaha;\nto Nir _ri_ ti svaha; to the divine Rakshas svaha.'\n\n4\\. If, before returning home (from his teacher, a student) voluntarily\ndefiles himself, sleeps in the day-time, or practises any other vow (than that\nof studentship), the same (penance must be performed). 4\n\n5\\. If he has committed a bestial crime, he shall give a white bull (to a\nBrahma _n_ a). 5\n\n6\\. The guilt incurred by a bestial crime with a cow, has been explained by\nthe (rule regarding) the killing of a female of the _S_ udra caste. 6\n\n7\\. A student breaks his vow by performing funeral rites, 7\n\n8\\. Excepting those of his mother and his father. 8\n\n9\\. If a (student) is sick, he may eat, at his pleasure, all that is left by\nhis teacher as medicine. 9\n\n10\\. If (a student) who is employed by his teacher (to perform some duty),\nmeets with his death, (the teacher) shall perform three K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra\npenances. 10\n\np. 119\n\n11\\. If a student eats meat which has been given to him as leavings (by his\nteacher), he shall perform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance of twelve days'\nduration, and afterwards finish his vow. 11\n\n12\\. The same (penance must be performed) if he eats food given at a _S_\nraddha or by a person who is impure on account of a recent death or birth. 12\n\n13\\. It is declared in the Veda, than honey given without asking does not\ndefile (a student) of the Va _g_ asaneyi- _s_ akha. 13\n\n14\\. For him who committing suicide becomes An Abhi _s_ asta, his blood-\nrelations (sapi _n_ _d_ a) shall not perform the funeral rites. 14\n\n15\\. He is called a suicide who destroys himself by means of wood, water,\nclods of earth, stones, weapons, poison, or a rope.\n\n16\\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The twice-born man who out of\naffection performs the last rites for a suicide, shall perform a _K_ andraya\n_n_ a penance together with a Taptak _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra.' 16\n\n17\\. We shall describe the _K_ andraya _n_ a below. 17\n\n18\\. A fast of three days (must be performed) for resolving to die by one's\nown hand.\n\np. 120\n\n19\\. 'He who attempts suicide, but remains alive, shall perform a K _ri_ _k_\n_kh_ ra penance during twelve days. (Afterwards) he shall fast for three (days\nand) nights, being dressed constantly in a garment smeared (with clarified\nbutter), and suppressing his breath, he shall thrice recite the Aghamarsha _n_\na;'\n\n20\\. Or, following the same rule, he may also frequently recite the Gayatri;\n\n21\\. Or, having kindled a fire, he may offer clarified butter with the Kushma\n_n_ _d_ as.\n\n22\\. 'And the guilt (of) all (offences) excepting mortal sins is removed\nthereby.' 22\n\n23\\. Now he may also sip water in the morning, thinking of (the Mantra), 'May\nfire and wrath and the lords of wrath protect me,' &c., and meditating on his\nsin; (then) he may mutter the Vyah _ri_ tis that end with satya (truth),\nprefixing (the syllable) Om (to each), or he may recite the Aghamarsha _n_ a.\n23\n\n24\\. If he touches a human bone to which fat still adheres, he becomes impure\nduring three (days and) nights; 24\n\n25\\. But (on touching a bone) to which no fat adheres, a day and a night,\n\n26\\. Likewise if he has followed a corpse (to the burial-ground). 26\n\n27\\. If he passes between men reciting the Veda, he shall fast during a day\nand a night.\n\n28\\. (Those who recite the Veda) shall sprinkle each other with water and stay\naway (from their houses) during three (days and) nights. 28\n\np. 121\n\n29\\. (The same penance must be performed) for a day and night, if a dog, a\ncat, or an ichneumon pass quickly (between those who recite the Veda). 29\n\n30\\. If he has swallowed the flesh of a dog, a cock, a village pig, a grey\nheron, a vulture, a Bhasa, a pigeon, a man, a crow or an owl, (he must) fast\nduring seven days, (and thus) empty his entrails (afterwards he must) eat\nclarified butter, and be initiated again. 30\n\n31\\. 'But a Brahma _n_ a who has been bitten by a dog, becomes pure, if he\ngoes to a river that flows into the ocean, (bathes there), suppresses his\nbreath one hundred times, and eats clarified butter.' 31\n\n32\\. 'Time, fire, purity of mind, water, looking at the sun, and ignorance (of\ndefilement) are the six means by which created beings are purified.' 32\n\n33\\. It is declared in the Veda that, on touching a dog, a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala,\nor an outcast, he becomes at once pure, if he bathes, dressed in his clothes.\n33\n\n34\\. If (while reciting the Veda) they hear noises\n\np. 122\n\nmade by outcasts or _K_ a _n_ _d_ alas, they shall sit silent and fasting\nduring three days;\n\n35\\. Or if they repeat that (text of the Gayatri) at least one thousand times,\nthey become pure; thus it is stated in the Veda.\n\n36\\. By this rule (the penance to be performed by) those who teach or\nsacrifice for vile men has been explained. It is declared in the Veda that\nthey become pure by also relinquishing the fees (which they received). 36\n\n37\\. By this same (rule the penance prescribed for) an Abhi _s_ asta, (one\naccused of a heinous crime,) has been explained.\n\n38\\. (If he has been accused of) killing a learned Brahma _n_ a, let him\nsubsist during twelve days on water (only), and fast during (another) twelve\ndays. 38\n\n39\\. If he has falsely accused a Brahma _n_ a of a crime which causes loss of\ncaste, or of a minor offence which does not cause loss of caste, he shall\nsubsist during a month on water (only), and constantly repeat the ( _Ri_ _k_\nas called) _S_ uddhavatis; 39\n\n40\\. Or he may go to bathe (with the priests) at (the conclusion of) a horse-\nsacrifice.\n\n41\\. By this (rule the penance for) intercourse with a female of the _K_ a _n_\n_d_ ala caste has been declared. 41\n\n42\\. Now (follows the description of) another K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance,\napplicable to all (men), where (the rule given above) has been altered.\n\n43\\. On one day (let him eat) in the morning (only), on the (following) day at\nnight (only), on the (next) day food given without asking, and on the (fourth)\nday (let him) fast; the succeeding (three) periods of\n\np. 123\n\nfour days (must be passed) in the same manner. Wishing to show favour to the\nBrahma _n_ as, Manu, the chief among the pillars of the law, has thus\ndescribed the _S_ isuk _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra (the hard penance of children) for\ninfants, aged, and sick men.\n\n44\\. Now follows the rule for (the performance of) the _K_ andraya _n_ a\n(lunar penance). 44\n\n45\\. On the first day of the dark half (of the month) let him eat fourteen\n(mouthfuls), let him diminish the (number of) mouthfuls (each day by one), and\ncontinue in this manner until the end of the fortnight. In like manner let him\neat one mouthful on the first day of the bright half, and (daily) increasing\n(the number 6f) mouthfuls, continue until the end of the fortnight.\n\n46\\. Meanwhile let him sing Samans, or mutter the Vyah _ri_ tis.\n\n47\\. A month during which he thus performs a _K_ andraya _n_ a, the _Ri_ shis\nhave called by way of laudation, 'a means of purification' (pavitra). It is\nprescribed as an expiation of all (offences) for which no (special penance)\nhas been mentioned.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[117:1](sbe1426.htm#fr_641) **XXIII**. Gautama XXIII, 17\n\n[118:4](sbe1426.htm#fr_642) Manu XI, 121.\n\n[118:5](sbe1426.htm#fr_643) Vish _n_ u LIII, 7; Gautama XXII, 36.\n\n[118:6](sbe1426.htm#fr_644) Vish _n_ u LIII, 3; Gautama XXIII, 12.\n\n[118:7](sbe1426.htm#fr_645) Manu V, 88.\n\n[118:8](sbe1426.htm#fr_646) Mann V, 91.\n\n[118:9](sbe1426.htm#fr_647) The object of the Sutra is to permit during\nsickness a relaxation of the rules regarding forbidden food. Hence a sick\nstudent may eat honey, meat, &c.\n\n[118:10](sbe1426.htm#fr_648) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 283. 'Meets with his\ndeath,' e.g. is killed by a wild animal or a snake, while collecting fuel in\nthe forest.\n\n[119:11](sbe1426.htm#fr_649) Manu XI, 159; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 282; see\nalso \xc3\x82pastamba's discussion on the subject, I, 1, 4, 5.\n\n[119:12](sbe1426.htm#fr_650) Manu XI, 158.\n\n[119:13](sbe1426.htm#fr_651) This Sutra may also mean, 'It is declared that,\naccording to the Va _g_ asaneyaka, honey given (to a student). without his\nasking for it does not defile him.' But a parallel passage of Devala, which K\n_ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita quotes, makes, I think, the version given above\nappear preferable. In either case the passage is explained by the fact that,\naccording to the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a, _S_ vetaketu, one of the great\nteachers of the White Ya _g_ ur-veda, strongly pleaded for the use of honey;\nsee Weber, Indische Studien X, 123 seq.\n\n[119:14](sbe1426.htm#fr_652) Vish _n_ u XXII, 56; Gautama XIV, 12.\n\n[119:16](sbe1426.htm#fr_653) Vish _n_ u XXII, 58-59.\n\n[119:17](sbe1426.htm#fr_654) See below, Sutra 45.\n\n[120:22](sbe1426.htm#fr_655) Regarding the efficacy of the Kushma _n_ _d_ a\ntexts, see above, XXII, 9.\n\n[120:23](sbe1426.htm#fr_656) The text occurs Taitt. \xc3\x82r. X, 24, I.\n\n[120:24](sbe1426.htm#fr_657)-25. Manu V, 87; Vish _n_ u XXII, 75.\n\n[120:26](sbe1426.htm#fr_658) Manu V, 101.\n\n[120:28](sbe1426.htm#fr_659) Gautama I, 58.\n\n[121:29](sbe1426.htm#fr_660) Gautama I, 59.\n\n[121:30](sbe1426.htm#fr_661) Vish _n_ u LI, 3-4; Gautama XXIII, 4-5; Manu XI,\n157. The Sutra is badly corrupted in K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita's edition.\nI read ka\xe1\xb9\x85ka instead of va\xe1\xb9\x85ka, leave out vayasa after bhasa, and change\nkakolukana _m_ sadane to kakolukama _m_ sadane. The latter change is\nabsolutely necessary; firstly, because the penances for killing dogs and men\nhave been given above; secondly, because the word manusha requires a noun\nwhich it qualifies at the end of the compound; thirdly, because the penance\nwhich is prescribed, fasting until the entrails are empty, is absurd for\nmurder, but appropriate for eating forbidden food; and fourthly, because the\nparallel passages of other Sm _ri_ tis actually do prescribe it for eating the\nflesh of excessively impure animals and for cannibalism. The change of ama to\nana is a very common mistake in Devanagari MSS.\n\n[121:31](sbe1426.htm#fr_662) Vish _n_ u LIV, 12.\n\n[121:32](sbe1426.htm#fr_663) Vish _n_ u XXII, 88.\n\n[121:33](sbe1426.htm#fr_664) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 15, 16.\n\n[122:36](sbe1426.htm#fr_665) Vish _n_ u LIV, 25, 28.\n\n[122:38](sbe1426.htm#fr_666) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 287.\n\n[122:39](sbe1426.htm#fr_667) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 286.\n\n[122:41](sbe1426.htm#fr_668) Vish _n_ u LIII, 5, 6.\n\n[123:44](sbe1426.htm#fr_669)-47.
