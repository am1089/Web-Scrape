VI, 1), \'I take thee, at the\nimpulse of the divine Savit _ri_ , with the arms of the A _s_ vins, with the\nhands of Pushan: thou art a woman.\' The significance of that formula is the\nsame (as before); and that spade (abhri, fem.) is indeed female: therefore he\nsays \'thou art a woman.\'\n\n3:7:1:22\\. He thus draws the outline of the hole (for the stake 3), with,\n\'Herewith I cut off the necks of\n\np. 168\n\nthe Rakshas!\' The spade is the thunderbolt: with the thunderbolt he thus cuts\noff the necks of the Rakshas.\n\n3:7:1:33\\. He then digs, and throws up a heap of earth towards the east. He\ndigs the hole, making it equal (in depth) with the (unhewn) bottom part (of\nthe stake). In front of it he lays down the stake with the top towards the\neast. Thereon he puts sacrificial grass of the same size, and thereupon he\nputs the chip of the stake. In front on the (north) side (of the stake) he\nputs down the head-piece 1. The sprinkling-water has barley-corns mixed with\nit: the significance of this is the same (as before 2).\n\n3:7:1:44\\. He throws the barley-corns in with, \'Thou art barley (yava), keep\nthou (yavaya) from us the haters, keep from us the enemies!\' There is nothing\nobscure in this. He then sprinkles: the significance of the sprinkling is one\nand the same: he thereby renders it sacrificially pure.\n\n3:7:1:55\\. He sprinkles (the top, middle, and bottom parts) with, \'For the sky\n--thee! for the air--thee! for the earth--thee!\' the stake being a thunderbolt\n(he does so) for the protection of these worlds 3: \'I sprinkle thee for the\nprotection of these worlds,\' is what he thereby means to say.\n\n3:7:1:66\\. The sprinkling-water that remains he then pours into the hole with,\n\'Be the worlds pure\n\np. 169\n\nwherein the Fathers reside!\' for a pit that is dug is sacred to the Fathers:\nthis he thereby renders sacrificially pure.\n\n3:7:1:77\\. Thereupon he strews barhis-grass therein, both eastward-pointed and\nnorthward-pointed, with, \'Thou art the seat of the Fathers!\' for that part of\nit (the stake) which is dug into the ground is sacred to the Fathers: as\nthough it were (naturally) established among plants, and not dug in, so does\nit become established among those plants.\n\n3:7:1:88\\. He then throws in the (first) chip 1 of the stake. Now that chip of\nthe outer (bark) doubtless is the vigour of trees; hence, when a chip of their\nouter (bark) is cut off they dry up, for it is their vigour. Hence, when he\nthrows in the chip of the stake, he does so thinking, \'I will plant it (the\nstake) full of vigour.\' The reason why it is this (chip) and no other, is that\nthis one has been produced with a formula, is sacrificially pure: therefore he\nthrows in the chip of the stake.\n\n3:7:1:99\\. He throws it in with (Va _g_. S. VI, 2), \'Thou art a leader, easy\nof access to the Unnet _ri_ s 2;\' for that (chip) is cut from it in front,\nwherefore he says, \'Thou art a leader, easy of access to the Unnet _ri_ s.\'\n\'Be thou mindful of this: it will stand upon thee!\' for it (the stake) will\nindeed stand on it, wherefore he says, \'Be thou mindful of this: it will stand\nupon thee.\'\n\n3:7:1:1010\\. Having then taken out ghee with the dipping-spoon, he offers it\ninto the hole, \'lest the evil spirits should rise from below:\' ghee is a\nthunderbolt, he\n\np. 170\n\nthus repels the evil spirits by means of the thunderbolt, and thus the evil\nspirits do not rise from below. Having then gone round to the front, he sits\ndown facing the north and anoints the stake. He says (to the Hot _ri_ ),\n\'Recite to the stake as it is anointed 1!\'\n\n3:7:1:1111\\. He anoints it with, \'The divine Savit _ri_ anoint thee with sweet\ndrink (milk)!\' for Savit _ri_ is the impeller (prasavit _ri_ ) of the gods,\nand that stake is in reality the sacrificer himself; and sweet drink is\neverything here; he thus puts it in connection with all that, and Savit _ri_ ,\nthe impeller, impels it for him: therefore he says, \'The divine Savit _ri_\nanoint thee with sweet drink!\'\n\n3:7:1:1212\\. Having then anointed the top-ring on both sides, he puts it on\n(the stake) with, \'To the full-berried plants--thee!\' for that (top-ring) is\nas its berry. And as to its being, as it were, contracted in the middle, the\nberry 2 here on trees is fastened (to the stalk) sideways; what connecting\npart there is between (the fruit and stalk) pressed in, as it were, that he\nthereby makes it. This is why it is, as it were, contracted in the middle.\n\n3:7:1:1313\\. He anoints from top to bottom the (corner) facing the fire; for\nthe (corner) facing the fire is the sacrificer, and the ghee is sap: with sap\nhe thus anoints the sacrificer; therefore he anoints from top to bottom the\n(corner) facing the fire. He then\n\np. 171\n\ngrasps the girding-part all round, and says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Recite to the\n(stake) being set up!\'\n\n3:7:1:1414\\. He raises it with, \'With thy crest thou hast touched the sky;\nwith thy middle thou hast filled the air; with thy foot thou hast steadied the\nearth;\'--the sacrificial stake being a thunderbolt, (he raises it) for the\nconquering of these worlds; with that thunderbolt he gains these worlds, and\ndeprives his enemies of their share in these worlds.\n\n3:7:1:1515\\. He then plants it (in the hole) with (Va _g_. S. VI, 3), \'To what\nresorts of thine we long to go where are the swift-footed, many-horned kine;\nthere, forsooth, was imprinted wide-striding Vish _n_ u\'s highest mighty foot-\nstep.\' With this trish _t_ ubh verse he plants it; the trish _t_ ubh is a\nthunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a thunderbolt; therefore he plants it\nwith a trish _t_ ubh verse.\n\n3:7:1:1616\\. That (corner which was) facing the fire he places opposite the\nfire; for the (corner) facing the fire is the sacrificer, and the sacrifice is\nfire. Hence were he to turn the fire-corner aside from the fire, the\nsacrificer would assuredly turn aside from the sacrifice; therefore he places\nthe (corner which was) facing the fire opposite the fire. He then heaps up\n(earth) round it and presses it firmly all round, and pours water thereon 1.\n\n3:7:1:1717\\. Thereupon he makes (the sacrificer) say while touching it (Va\n_g_. S. VI, 4; Rig-veda I, 22, 19), \'See ye the deeds of Vish _n_ u, whereby\nhe beheld the sacred ordinances, Indra\'s allied\n\np. 172\n\nfriend!\' For he who has set up the sacrificial stake has hurled the\nthunderbolt: \'See ye Vish _n_ u\'s conquest!\' he means to say when he says,\n\'See ye the deeds of Vish _n_ u, whereby he beheld the sacred ordinances,\nIndra\'s allied friend.\' Indra, forsooth, is the deity of the sacrifice, and\nthe sacrificial stake belongs to Vish _n_ u; he thereby connects it with\nIndra; therefore he says, \'Indra\'s allied friend.\'\n\n3:7:1:1818\\. He then looks up at the top-ring with (Va _g_. S. VI, 5; Rig-veda\nI, 22, 20), \'The wise ever behold that highest step of Vish _n_ u, fixed like\nan eye in the heaven.\' For he who has set up the sacrificial stake has hurled\nthe thunderbolt: \'See ye that conquest of Vish _n_ u!\' he means to say when he\nsays, \'The wise ever behold that highest step of Vish _n_ u, fixed like an eye\nin the heaven.\'\n\n3:7:1:1919\\. He then girds (the stake with a rope of ku _s_ a-grass). Now it\nis to cover its nakedness that he girds it; wherefore he girds it in this\nplace (viz. on a level with the sacrificer\'s navel), for it is thus that this\n(nether) garment is (slung round) 1. He thereby puts food into him, for it is\nthere that the food settles; therefore he girds it at that place.\n\n3:7:1:2020\\. He girds it with a triple (rope), for threefold is food, and food\nmeans cattle; and (there is) the father and the mother, and what is born is\nthe third; therefore he girds it with a triple (rope).\n\n3:7:1:2121\\. He girds it with (Va _g_. S. VI, 6), \'Thou art enfolded; may the\nheavenly hosts enfold\n\np. 173\n\nthee! may riches enfold this sacrificer among men!\' He invokes a blessing on\nthe sacrificer, when he says, \'May riches enfold this sacrificer among men.\'\n\n3:7:1:2222\\. Thereupon he inserts a chip of the stake (under the rope) with,\n\'Thou art the son of the sky.\' For it is doubtless the offspring of that\n(sacrificial stake); hence if there be the full number of eleven stakes 1, let\nhim insert in each its own (chip) without confounding them; and his offspring\nis born orderly and not foolish. But whosoever inserts them in confusion, not\nits own in each, verily his offspring is born disorderly and foolish;\ntherefore let him insert its own in each without confounding them.\n\n3:7:1:2323\\. Moreover, that chip of the stake is made an ascent to the\nheavenly world; there is this girdle-rope; after the rope the chip of the\nstake; after the chip of the stake the top-ring; and from the top-ring one\nreaches the heavenly world.\n\n3:7:1:2424\\. And as to why it is called svaru (\'very sore\'),--that (chip) is\ncut off from that (stake), and thus is its own (sva) sore (arus); therefore it\nis called \'svaru.\'\n\n3:7:1:2525\\. With that part of it which is dug in, he gains the world of the\nFathers; and with what is above the dug-in part, up to the girdle-rope, he\ngains the world of men; and with what is above the rope, up to the top-ring,\nhe gains the world of the gods; and what (space of) two or three fingers\'\nbreadths\n\np. 174\n\nthere is above the top-ring,--the gods called the \'Blessed 1,\'--their world he\ntherewith gains; verily, whosoever thus knows this, he becomes one of the same\nworld with the blessed gods.\n\n3:7:1:2626\\. That (sacrificial stake) he sets up on the fore-part (of the\naltar); for the stake is a thunderbolt, as the club is a thunderbolt. But in\nhurling the club one takes hold of its fore-part; and that (stake) is the\nfore-part of the sacrifice; therefore he sets it up on the fore-part (of the\naltar).\n\n3:7:1:2727\\. Verily, by means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme\nauthority which they now wield. They spake, \'How may this (world) of ours be\nmade unattainable to men?\' They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees would\nsuck out honey, and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of\nthe sacrificial stake, they disappeared. And because they scattered (yopaya)\ntherewith, therefore it is called yupa (sacrificial stake). At the head stands\nintelligence, at the head swiftness of thought; therefore he sets it up on the\nfore-part (of the altar).\n\n3:7:1:2828\\. It is eight-cornered; for the gayatri  metre consists of eight\nsyllables, and the gayatri is the fore-part of the sacrifice, as this (stake)\nis the forepart of the sacrifice; therefore it is eight-cornered.\n\n3:7:1:2929\\. Now the gods once threw it after (the prastara into the fire)\neven as now some throw it after, thinking, \'So the gods did it.\' Thereupon the\nRakshas sipped the sacrifice (Soma) after (the gods).\n\n3:7:1:3030\\. The gods said unto the Adhvaryu, \'Offer thou only a chip of the\nstake; thereby this (sacrificer)\n\np. 175\n\nwill be bid good-speed 1; and thus the Rakshas will not hereafter sip the\nsacrifice, thinking, "that (stake) surely is a raised thunderbolt."\'\n\n3:7:1:3131\\. The Adhvaryu, then, offered up only a chip of the stake, and\nthereby that (sacrificer) was bid good-speed; and thus the Rakshas did not\nthereafter sip the sacrifice, thinking, \'that surely is a raised thunderbolt.\'\n\n3:7:1:3232\\. And in like manner does he now only offer up that chip of the\nsacrificial stake 2; thereby this (sacrificer) is bid good-speed; and thus the\nRakshas do not thereafter sip the sacrifice, thinking, \'that surely is a\nraised thunderbolt!\' He offers it 3 with the text (Va _g_. S. VI, 21), \'May\nthy smoke rise up to the sky, thy light to the heavens! fill the earth with\nashes, Hail!\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[167:3](sbe2627.htm#fr_439) According to the Ka _n_ va text, one half of it is\nto be within, and one half outside of the altar.
