(The Vedic statement concerning the origination of ether) has a secondary\nsense, on account of the impossibility (of the origination of ether).\n\nThe ether does not originate on account of the absence of scriptural\nstatement.--That other passage which (apparently) declares the origination of\nthe ether must be taken as having a secondary (figurative) meaning.--Why? On\naccount of the impossibility. The origination of ether cannot be shown to be\npossible as long as there exist followers of the opinion of the reverend Ka\n_n_ abhu _g_ (Ka _n_ ada). For the latter deny the origination of ether on the\nground that it is impossible to demonstrate the existence of the required\napparatus of causes. Whatever is originated, they say, is originated from\ninherent causes, non-inherent causes, and operative causes. Of a substance the\ninherent causes are substances belonging to the same class and more than one\nin number. But for ether there are no such originating substances, belonging\nto the same\n\np. 6\n\nclass and more than one in number, from which, as its inherent cause, it could\noriginate, and consequently there also exists no non-inherent cause of ether;\nfor the latter would have to be looked for in the conjunction of the primary\nsubstances. And as thus there exist no inherent cause and no non-inherent\ncause, there is absolutely no room for an operative cause; for the only\nfunction of the latter is to assist the two other causes. Those elements\nmoreover which have an origin, as fire and the like, we may conceive to exist\nin different conditions at an earlier and a later time; we may conceive e.g.\nthat fire, previously to its origination, did not give light or produce any\nother effects, while it does do so subsequently to its origination. Of the\nether, on the other hand, no such difference between an earlier and a later\nperiod can be conceived; for, we ask, would it be possible to maintain that\nbefore its alleged origination there were no large, minute, and atomic spaces?\n--That ether is without an origin further follows from its characteristic\nqualities, such as all-pervadingness and so on, which altogether distinguish\nit from earth and the other elements.--Hence, as the word 'ether' (aka _s_ a)\nis used in a secondary sense in such phrases as 'make room' (aka _s_ a),\n'there is room,' and as space although one only is designated as being of\ndifferent kinds when we speak of the space of a jar, the space of a house, &c.\n--a form of expression met with even in Vedic passages such as 'he is to place\nthe wild animals in the spaces' (aka _s_ eshu)'--we conclude that those Vedic\npassages also which speak of its origination must be supposed to have a\nsecondary meaning.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 4](sbe38005.htm)\n\n"
