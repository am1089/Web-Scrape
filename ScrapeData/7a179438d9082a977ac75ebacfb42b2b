The Sapi _n_ _d_ as become impure by the death (of a relative) during ten\n(days and) nights, except those who officiate as priests, who have performed\nthe Diksha _n_ iyesh _t_ i (or initiatory ceremony of a _S_ rauta sacrifice),\nand those who are students. 1\n\n2\\. (The impurity) of a Kshatriya lasts for eleven (days and) nights, 2\n\n3, (That) of a Vai _s_ ya twelve (days and) nights,\n\n4\\. (Or), according to some, half a month,\n\n5\\. (And that) of a _S_ udra a whole month. 5\n\n6\\. If during (a period of impurity) another (death) happens, the (relatives)\nshall be pure after (the lapse of) the remainder of that (first period). 6\n\np. 250\n\n7\\. (But) if one night (only of the period of impurity) remains (and another\ndeath happens, they shall become pure) after (the lapse of) two (days and\nnights).\n\n8\\. (If the second death happens) on the morning (after the completion of the\nperiod of impurity, they shall be purified) after three (days and nights).\n\n9\\. (The relatives) of those who are slain for the sake of cows and Brahma _n_\nas (become pure) immediately after the burial, 9\n\n10\\. And (those of men destroyed) by the anger of the king, 10\n\n11\\. (Further, those of men killed) in battle,\n\n12\\. Likewise (those) of men who voluntarily (die) by starving themselves to\ndeath, by weapons, fire, poison, or water, by hanging themselves, or by\njumping (from a precipice). 12\n\n13\\. Sapi _n_ _d_ a-relationship ceases with the fifth or the seventh\n(ancestor). 13\n\n14\\. (The rules regarding impurity caused by the 14\n\np. 251\n\ndeath of a relative apply) to the birth (of a child) also.\n\n15\\. (In) that (case the impurity falls) on the parents,\n\n16\\. Or on, the mother (alone).\n\n17\\. (The impurity) for a miscarriage (lasts for a number of days and) nights\nequal to (the number of) months from conception, 17\n\n18\\. Or three days.\n\n19\\. And if he hears (of the death of a Sapi _n_ _d_ a) after (the lapse of)\nten (days and nights, the impurity lasts for) one night together with the\npreceding and following days,\n\n20\\. Likewise when a relative who is not a Sapi _n_ _d_ a, a relative by\nmarriage, or a fellow-student (has died). 20\n\n21\\. For a man who studies the same recension of the Veda (the impurity lasts)\none day, 21\n\np. 252\n\n22\\. Likewise for a _S_ rotriya who dwells in the same house. 22\n\n23\\. On touching (i.e. on carrying out) a corpse from an interested motive,\nthe impurity lasts for ten days. 23\n\n24\\. (The duration of the impurity) of a Vai _s_ ya and of a _S_ udra (in the\nsame case) has been declared (by Sutras 3-5).\n\n25\\. Or (it shall last for these two) as many nights as there are seasons (in\nthe year); 25\n\n26\\. And (the same rule may be made applicable) to the two higher (castes).\n\n27\\. Or (the impurity lasts) three days.\n\n28\\. And if the teacher, his son or wife, a person for whom (a Brahma _n_ a)\nsacrifices or a pupil (has been carried out, the duration of the impurity is)\nthe same. 28\n\np. 253\n\n29\\. And if a man of lower caste carries, out (the corpse of) one of higher\ncaste, or a man of higher caste (carries out the body of) one of lower caste,\n(the duration of) the impurity in these (cases) is determined by (the caste\nof) the dead man.\n\n30\\. On touching an outcast, a Ka _n_ _d_ ala, a woman impure on account of\nher confinement, a woman in her courses, or a corpse, and on touching persons\nwho have touched them, he shall purify himself by bathing dressed in his\nclothes, 30\n\n31\\. Likewise if he has followed a corpse (that was being carried out), 31\n\n32\\. And (if he has come into contact) with a dog. 32\n\n33\\. Some (declare), that (the limb) which (a dog) may touch (must be washed).\n\n34\\. The Sapi _n_ _d_ as shall offer (libations of) water for (a deceased\nrelative) whose _K_ aula-karman (or tonsure) has been performed, 34\n\n35\\. As well as for the wives and daughters of such (a person).\n\n36\\. Some (declare, that it must be done in the case) of married female\nrelatives (also). 36\n\np. 254\n\n37\\. (During the period of impurity) all (the mourners) shall sleep and sit on\nthe ground and remain chaste. 37\n\n38\\. They shall not clean (themselves);\n\n39\\. Nor shall they eat meat until (the funeral oblation) has been offered. 39\n\n40\\. On the first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth (days after the death)\nwater (mixed with sesamum) must be offered.\n\n41\\. And the garments (worn during that ceremony) must be changed,\n\n42\\. But on the last (day they must be given) to men of the lowest castes.\n\n43\\. The parents (shall offer water for a son who dies) after he has teethed.\n\n44\\. If infants, (relatives) who live in a distant country, those who have\nrenounced domestic life, and those who are not Sapi _n_ _d_ as, (die), the\npurification is instantaneous. 44\n\n45\\. Kings (remain always pure), lest their business be impeded, 45\n\n46\\. And a Brahma _n_ a, lest his daily study of the Veda be interrupted. 46\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[249:1](sbe0278.htm#fr_1212) **XIV**. Manu V, 59, 83, 93; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\nIII, 18, 28; see also \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 18. Regarding the meaning of the\nterm Sapi _n_ _d_ a, see below, Sutra 13. This Sutra refers, of course, to\nBrahma _n_ as only.\n\n[249:2](sbe0278.htm#fr_1213)-3. Manu V, 83; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 22.\n\n[249:5](sbe0278.htm#fr_1214) Manu and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya l. l. cit.\n\n[249:6](sbe0278.htm#fr_1215) Manu V, 79.\n\n[250:9](sbe0278.htm#fr_1216) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 27. The Sutra may,\nhowever, also be translated 'the relatives of those who have been killed by a\ncow, or by a Brahma _n_ a, &c.,' as the latter case, too, is mentioned by Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 21. The word anvaksham, translated by 'immediately after\nburial,' is explained by Haradatta as follows: 'The corpse is seen, i.e. is\nvisible, so Iona; the meaning is that they will be pure after having bathed at\nthe end of the burial.'\n\n[250:10](sbe0278.htm#fr_1217) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 21.\n\n[250:12](sbe0278.htm#fr_1218) Manu V, 89; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 21.\n\n[250:13](sbe0278.htm#fr_1219) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 15, 2. Haradatta states that\nthe Sapi _n_ _d_ a relationship extends to four degrees in the case of the son\nof an appointed daughter (see below, XXVIII, 18), while it includes the\nrelatives within six degrees in the case of a legitimate son of the body. In\neither case the term refers to Sagotra-sapi _n_ _d_ as, or Sapi _n_ _d_ as who\nbear the same family name only. The case of the Bhinnagotra-sapi _n_ _d_ as\nwill be discussed below, Sutra 20.\n\n[250:14](sbe0278.htm#fr_1220)-16. Manu V, 62; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 18-19.\n\n[251:17](sbe0278.htm#fr_1221) Manu V, 66; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 20. 19. Manu\nV, 75-77.\n\n[251:20](sbe0278.htm#fr_1222) Manu V, 81. Haradatta explains asapi _n_ _d_ a,\n'a kinsman who is not a Sapi _n_ _d_ a,' by Samanodaka, i.e. 'a kinsman\nbearing the same family name, but more than six degrees removed,' and\nyonisambandha, 'a relative by marriage,' by 'the maternal grandfather, a\nmaternal aunt's sons, and their sons, &c., the fathers of wives and the rest.'\nThe latter term, for which 'a person related through a female' would be a more\nexact rendering than the one given above, includes, therefore, those persons\nwho, according to the terminology of Manu and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, are called\nBhinnagotra-sapi _n_ _d_ as, Bandhavas, or Bandhus (see Colebrooke, Mitakshara\nII, 53; II, 6). Gautama's terminology agrees in this respect with that of\n\xc3\x82pastamba, see note on II, 5, 11, 16.\n\n[251:21](sbe0278.htm#fr_1223) Haradatta explains sabrahma _k_ arin by suh _ri_\nt, 'a friend.' But the term which elsewhere means 'a fellow-student' cannot\nhave that sense in our Sutra, as the fellow-student (sahadhyayin) has been\nmentioned already. The translation given above is supported by the manner in\nwhich it is used in the ancient landgrants, where expressions like bahv _ri_\n_k_ asabrahma _k_ arin are of common occurrence.\n\n[252:22](sbe0278.htm#fr_1224) Manu V, 81.\n\n[252:23](sbe0278.htm#fr_1225) 'The word upaspar _s_ ana (literally touching)\ndoes not denote here simple touching. For below, Sutra 30, bathing with the\nclothes on, will be prescribed for that, What does upaspar _s_ ana then mean?\nIt means carrying out a corpse. For that an impurity lasting ten days falls on\nthe performer, provided that the carrying out be done for an object, i.e. with\nthe intention of gaining a fee or the like, not for the sake of doing one's\nduty. The word impurity is here repeated in order to indicate that the\nimpurity, here intended, differs from that described above. Hence the rules\ngiven below, Sutra 37, which prescribe sleeping and sitting on the ground and\nso forth, do not apply. (The word impurity) indicates (here) merely that (the\nperformer of the act) must not be touched, and has no right (to perform sacred\nceremonies).'--Haradatta.\n\n[252:25](sbe0278.htm#fr_1226) Haradatta states that Gautama does not simply\nsay 'six days,' because five seasons only are to be reckoned in the case of a\nVai _s_ ya, and six in the case of a _S_ udra.\n\n[252:28](sbe0278.htm#fr_1227) Haradatta asserts that m _ri_ teshu, 'have\ndied,' must be understood. But as both the preceding and the following Sutras.\nrefer to p. 253 the carrying out of corpses, it is impossible to agree with\nhim. It seems to me that Gautama's rule means, that, if a man has carried out\nthe corpse of a teacher, &c., he becomes impure for ten, eleven, or twelve\ndays, or for three days only. See also Manu V, 91, 103; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\nIII, 15.\n\n[253:30](sbe0278.htm#fr_1228) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 2, 8-9; Manu V, 85; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya III, 30.\n\n[253:31](sbe0278.htm#fr_1229) Manu V, 103; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 26.\n\n[253:32](sbe0278.htm#fr_1230)-33. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 15, 16-17.\n\n[253:34](sbe0278.htm#fr_1231) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 15, 9; Manu V, 70. Haradatta\nobserves that most G _ri_ hya-sutras prescribe the performance of the _K_\naula-karman in the third year,\n\n[253:36](sbe0278.htm#fr_1232) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 4.\n\n[254:37](sbe0278.htm#fr_1233) Manu V, 73; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 16.\n\n[254:39](sbe0278.htm#fr_1234) Manu V, 73. 43. Manu V, 70.\n\n[254:44](sbe0278.htm#fr_1235) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 23, Haradatta remarks\nthat the rule refers to those Sapi _n_ _d_ as residing in foreign countries\nonly, of whose death one may hear a year after their decease, and to remoter\nrelations of whose death one hears after the lapse of ten days; see Manu V,\n75-76.\n\n[254:45](sbe0278.htm#fr_1236) Manu V, 93-94; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 27.\nHaradatta add: that the plural 'kings' is used in order to include all rulers\nand governors, and such persons as the king wishes to be pure.\n\n[254:46](sbe0278.htm#fr_1237) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya III, 28.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XV](sbe0279.htm)\n\n"
