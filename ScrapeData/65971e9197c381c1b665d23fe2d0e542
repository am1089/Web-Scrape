The reader is introduced to\nthe various sacred works of the Hindus, including the ancient invocatory hymns\nof the four Vedas, the later speculative and expository "Forest Books" in\nwhich "the Absolute is grasped and proclaimed", and those great epic poems the\n_R amayana_, which is three times longer than the _Iliad_ , and the _M\nahabharata_, which is four times longer than the _R amayana_. In no other\ncountry have the national poets given fuller and finer expression to the\nbeliefs and ideals and traditions of a people, or achieved as a result wider\nand more enduring fame. At the present day over two hundred million Hindus are\nfamiliar in varying degrees with the legendary themes and traditional beliefs\nwhich the ancient forest sages and poets of India invested with much beautiful\nsymbolism, and used as mediums for speculative thought and profound spiritual\nteachings. The sacred books of India are to the Hindus what the Bible is to\nChristians. Those who read them, or hear them read, are believed to be assured\nof prosperity in this world and of salvation in the next. To students of\nhistory, of ethnology, and of comparative religion they present features of\npeculiar interest, for they contain an elaborate sociology of the\n\np. ii\n\nancient Aryo-Indians, their political organizations, their codes of laws,\ntheir high ethical code, and above all their conceptions of God, the soul, and\nthe Universe. Some knowledge of them is necessary for those who desire to\napproach with sympathy the investigation of the religious beliefs of our Hindu\nfellow men and to understand their outlook upon life and the world.\n\nThe Introduction deals with various aspects of the study of these ancient\nmyths and legends which have been the inspiration of a national literature\ninfused with much grandeur and sublimity. The historic Aryan controversy, of\nwhich .the science of comparative mythology is a by-product, is passed under\nreview, and it is shown to what extent philological theories regarding race\nproblems have been modified during recent years as a result of the adoption of\nbroader and more exact methods of ethnic and archaeological research and the\never-extending study of comparative mythology. There has also been condensed\nmuch important data dealing with the early phases of Aryo-Indian civilization\naccumulated for historical purposes by industrious and painstaking Sanskrit\nscholars who have been engaged in investigating and systematizing the internal\nevidence of the various religious poems and treatises. It will be found that\nno general agreement has yet been reached regarding Aryo-Indian chronology,\nbut it now appears to be well established that although there were early\ncultural as well as racial "drifts", fresh invasions, which had far-reaching\nresults in the social and religious life of northern India, occurred at a late\nperiod in what is known as the Vedic Age. In consequence, the problem\npresented by this ancient civilization tends rather to grow more complex than\nto become simplified. Its origin is still wrapped in obscurity. At the very\ndawn of history Aryo-Indian culture had attained a comparatively\n\np. iii\n\nhigh state of development, and a considerable period must be allowed for its\ngrowth. Even some of the ancient Vedic hymns, addressed by priests to the\ndeities, are styled "new songs", which suggests the existence of an older\ncollection. Many of them also afford indications that immemorial beliefs were\nin process of change and fusion. The sublime deities, Varuna and Mitra\n(Mithra), for instance, were already declining in splendour. Yet they must\nhave been closely associated with Indra, king of the gods, in the unknown\nAryan homeland, as is made evident by an inscription recently deciphered at\nBoghaz Koi, in Asia Minor, which refers to them as deities of the mysterious\nMitanni people who were of Aryan speech like the settlers in the Punjab. There\nis no evidence, however, that the Mitanni rulers gave recognition to the fire\ngod Agni, who in India was exalted as the twin brother of Indra. The problem\ninvolved may not be devoid of ethnic significance, although the identity of\nthe Agni-worshipping section of the early raiders remains obscure.\n\nDuring the early Vedic Age in India prominence was given to the gods: the\nsocial organization was of patriarchal character; the goddesses remained\nshadowy and vague, some being, indeed, little more than figures of speech. A\ngreat change took place, however, after the invasions of the Bharata and other\ntribes who are now referred to as "late comers". Profound and speculative\nthinkers attained to the pantheistic conception of the world soul; new\ndoctrines, which are not referred to in the Vedic hymns, regarding the ages of\nthe universe and transmigration of souls, received wide acceptance as the\nresult of missionary efforts: the Vedic gods were reduced to the position of\nminor deities and new goddesses rose into prominence, one indeed being\nBharati,\n\np. iv\n\nthe tribal deity of the Bharatas, who became associated with the Saraswati\nriver and under her new name was ultimately made the wife of the supreme god\nBrahma. It is significant to note that the new culture radiated from the\n"Middle Country", the area controlled by the "late comers". That it contained\nelements which were not of Indian origin is made clearly evident when we find\nthat the doctrines of the ages of the universe and transmigration of souls\nwere shared by other peoples, including the Greeks and Celts and a section of\nthe ancient Egyptians. Sumero-Babylonian and Egyptian resemblances may also be\ntraced in post-Vedic religious literature, the former, for instance, in the\nDeluge legend, and the latter in the myth regarding the avenging goddess Kali,\nwho slaughters the enemies of the gods like Hathor-Sekhet, and has similarly\nto be restrained by one of the deities. The worship of goddesses was also\nprominent among the Sumerians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Celts, as contrasted\nwith the worship of gods among broad-headed mountain and wandering peoples. In\nthis connection special interest attaches to the conclusions of prominent\nethnologists, who include in the Mediterranean or "Brown" race of brunet "long\nheads" the early Egyptians and Neolithic Europeans, the Sumerians and present-\nday "Aryan" types in India, and especially in the old "Middle Country" and\nBengal. On the other hand, a broad-headed type is still prominent in the\nPunjab, the area occupied by the earliest invaders who worshipped the Vedic\ngods. Dr. Haddon suggests that these pioneers of civilization were mixed with\npeoples of Mongolian and other affinities. Some such ethnic explanation must\nbe urged to account for the differences between Vedic and post-Vedic\nmythologies. The invasions of the "late comers", who entered India by a new\n\np. v\n\nroute, no doubt stimulated thought and promoted culture after settled\nconditions were secured, as was undoubtedly the result of the mingling of\nraces elsewhere.\n\n"It may be put down as an axiom", says Professor Jastrow, "that nowhere does a\nhigh form of culture arise without the commingling of diverse ethnic elements.\nCivilization, like the spark emitted by the striking of steel on flint, is\neverywhere the result of stimulus evoked by the friction of one ethnic group\nupon another": and he supports his theory with the evidence afforded by Egypt,\nBabylonia, Greece, Rome, France, Germany, and Great Britain, as well as the\npresent-day United States of America, "the melting pot" of many peoples.\n\nThroughout this volume comparative evidence is provided to assist the reader\ntowards the study of this most interesting aspect of the Aryan problem. We\ntrace the cremation custom, which has prevailed in India since Vedic times, to\ncountries as wide apart as Great Britain, into which it was introduced during\nthe Bronze Age, and Southern Siberia, where it is still practised by the\nMongolian Buriats. Over the areas occupied by representatives of the\nMediterranean race it was unknown prior to the invasions of unidentified fire-\nworshippers. Special interest also attaches to the horse sacrifice, which was\nalso an Aryo-Indian ceremony even in Vedic times. It is not yet unknown among\nthe Buriats. At one time the horse sacrifice was widely prevalent. White\nhorses were sacrificed to the sun in Ancient Greece; the sun horses are\nreferred to with horror by Ezekiel; the ceremony was also connected with the\nmysteries of Aricia grove. Indeed, as is pointed out in Chapter V, various\nancient peoples offered up this domesticated and historic animal. In the\nIndian epics and religious treatises there are illuminating references to the\nhorse sacrifice which\n\np. vi\n\nthrow much light on the significance of the immemorial practice. White and\nblack horses were alternately favoured, and it is evident that the practice\nwas not only associated with solar worship, but was also intended to secure\nfertility--crops, and therefore rain in the first place, increase of flocks,\nherds, human offspring, &c.--as is undoubtedly the case among the modern- day\nBuriats. In India the horse was also offered up as a sin offering, a late\nconception, evidently. A prominent feature of this sacrifice in most countries\nwas the decapitation of the sacrificial victim. Recent evidence from Egypt\nsuggests that the sacrifice of the ass may have preceded the sacrifice of the\nhorse. Professor Flinders Petrie has found in a triple tomb in the early\ndynastic Tarkhan cemetery the skeletons of three asses with the heads cut off\nand placed beside them. He suggests that the animals were killed to accompany\ntheir owner to the other world. The Buriats still sacrifice horses at graves,\nprofessedly for the same reason. As this custom was not prevalent throughout\nAncient Egypt, it may have been an importation, connected, perhaps, with the\nmyth about the sun-ass which gallops round a hill-surrounded world followed by\nthe pursuing night serpent. An isolated reference is also made to the\nsacrifice of the ass in a Twelfth Dynasty story about a Naga-like demigod, a\nfact which emphasizes the historical importance of the material embedded in\nfolk tales and mythologies. In this connection it may be noted that certain\ndeveloped myths suggest there may have been either a cultural contact of\nAncient Egypt with India, through an unidentified medium, or an infusion of\nreligious ideas into both countries from a common source. In an Indian\ncreation myth Prajapati weeps creative tears like the Egyptian sun-god Ra,\nwhose rays are tears from which all things spring, as Maspero shows.\n\np. vii\n\nIn India the juice of the soma plant was identified with the vital principle,\nand the demons were the poisoners of crops and plants; in Egypt honey-flowers\nand sacred trees sprang from the fertilizing tears of deities, while the tears\nof demons produced poisonous plants, diseases, &c. Like the Egyptian Horus,\nthe Indian Prajapati, or Brahma, sprang from a lotus bloom floating on the\nprimordial waters. The chaos-egg myth is also common to both mythological\nsystems. Brahma issues from a golden egg like Ra, and a similar myth is\nconnected with the Egyptian Ptah and Khnumu, and with the Chinese P\'an Ku,\nwhile the egg figures in Eur-Asian folk tales which contain the germs of the\nvarious mythologies. All mythologies have animistic bases; they were, to begin\nwith, systematized folk beliefs which were carried hither and thither in\nvarious stages of development by migrating and trading peoples. Each separate\nsystem bears undoubted traces of racial or local influences; each reflects the\ncivilization in which it flourished, the habits of thought and habits of life\nof the people, and the religious, ethical, and political ideals of their\nrulers and teachers. When well-developed myths of similar character are found\nin widely separated districts, an ethnic or cultural contact is suggested.\nSuch myths may be regarded as evidence of remote racial movements, which,\nalthough unsupported by record or tradition, are also indicated by\nethnological data. It is hoped that the reader will find much suggestive\nmaterial in this connection in their study of the myths and legends of India.\nThey will also find that many of the tales retold in this volume have\nqualities which make universal appeal, and that some are among the most\nbeautiful which survive from the civilizations of the ancient world.\n\nNot a few, we are assured, will follow with interest\n\np. viii\n\nthe development from primitive myths of great and ennobling ideas which have\nexercised a culturing influence in India through many long centuries, and are\nstill potent factors in the domestic, social, and religious life of many\nmillions of Hindus.\n\nDONALD A.
