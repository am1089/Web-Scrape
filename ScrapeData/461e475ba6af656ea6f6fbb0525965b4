[1882], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n1:7:4\n\n### FOURTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n1:7:4:11\\. Pra _g_ apati conceived a passion for his own\n\np. 209\n\ndaughter,--either the Sky or the Dawn 1. \'May I pair with her!\' thus\n(thinking) he united with her.\n\n1:7:4:22\\. This, assuredly, was a sin in the eyes of the gods. \'He who acts\nthus towards his own daughter, our sister, [commits a sin],\' they thought.\n\n1:7:4:33\\. The gods then said to this god who rules over the beasts (Rudra) 2,\n\'This one, surely, commits a sin who acts thus towards his own daughter, our\nsister. Pierce him!\' Rudra, taking aim, pierced him. Half of his seed fell to\nthe ground. And thus it came to pass.\n\n1:7:4:44\\. Accordingly it has been said by the _Ri_ shi 3 with reference to\nthat (incident), \'When the father embraced his daughter, uniting with her, he\ndropped his seed on the earth.\' This (became) the chant (uktha) called\nagnimaruta 4; in (connection with)\n\np. 210\n\nthis it is set forth how the gods caused that seed to spring 1. When the anger\nof the gods subsided, they cured Pra _g_ apati and cut out that dart of this.\n(Rudra); for Pra _g_ apati, doubtless, is this sacrifice.\n\n1:7:4:55\\. They said (to one another), \'Think of some means by which that\n(part of the sacrifice torn out with the dart) may not be lost, and how it may\nbe but a small portion of the offering itself!\'\n\n1:7:4:66\\. They said, \'Take it round to Bhaga (Savit _ri_ , the Patron), who\nsits on the south side (of the sacrificial ground): Bhaga will eat it by way\nof fore-portion 2, so that it may be as though it were offered.\' They\naccordingly took it round to Bhaga, who sat on the south side. Bhaga (Savit\n_ri_ ) looked at it: it burnt out his eyes 3. And thus it came to pass. Hence\nthey say, \'Bhaga is blind.\'\n\n1:7:4:77\\. They said, \'It has not yet become appeased here: take it round to\nPushan!\' They accordingly\n\np. 211\n\ntook it round to Pushan. Pushan tasted it: it knocked out his teeth. And thus\nit came to pass. Hence they say, \'Pushan is toothless;\' and therefore, when\nthey prepare a mess of boiled rice ( _k_ aru) 1 for Pushan, they prepare it\nfrom ground rice, as is done for one toothless.\n\n1:7:4:88\\. They said, \'It has not yet become appeased here: take it round to B\n_ri_ haspati 2!\' They accordingly took it round to B _ri_ haspati. B _ri_\nhaspati hasted to Savit _ri_ for his impulsion (influence, prasava 3), for\nassuredly Savit _ri_ is the impeller (prasavit _ri_ ) of the gods. \'Impel\n(influence) this for me!\' he said. Savit _ri_ , as the impeller, accordingly\nimpelled it for him, and being thus impelled by Savit _ri_ , it did not injure\nhim: and thus it was henceforth appeased. This, then, is essentially the same\nas the fore-portion.\n\n1:7:4:99\\. Now when he cuts off the fore-portion, he cuts out what is injured\nin the sacrifice,--what belongs to Rudra. Thereupon he touches water: water is\n(a means) of lustration, hence he lustrates by means of water 4. He now cuts\noff piece by piece the i _d_ a 5, (which represents) cattle.\n\np. 212\n\n1:7:4:1010\\. Let him cut off (for the fore-portion) ever so small a piece 1:\nthus the dart comes out; let him therefore cut off ever so small a piece. He\nshould (according to some) put clarified butter on one side only, either below\nor above: thus that which is hard becomes soft and flows forth; and for this\nreason he should put butter on one side only, either below or above.\n\n1:7:4:1111\\. Having (nevertheless 2) made an underlayer of butter 3 and a\ndouble cutting from the oblation (havis), he pours butter on the upper side of\nit; for it is only in this way that this becomes part of the sacrifice.\n\n1:7:4:1212\\. Let him not carry it (to the Brahman) along the front (east) side\nof the \xc3\x82havaniya fire); (though) some, it is true, do carry it along the front\nside. For on the front side stand the cattle facing the sacrificer: hence he\nwould impose the power of Rudra on the cattle, if he were to carry it along\nthe front side, and his (the sacrificer\'s) household and cattle would be\noverwhelmed. Let him therefore cross over in this way (behind the paridhis);\nfor thus he does not impose Rudra\'s power on the cattle and he removes that\n(dart) sideways 4.\n\np. 213\n\n1:7:4:1313\\. He (the Brahman) receives 1 it, with the text (Va _g_. S. II, 11\nb, c), \'At the impulse (prasava) of the divine Savit _ri_ I receive thee with\nthe arms of the A _s_ vins, with the hands of Pushan!\'\n\n1:7:4:1414\\. And in like manner as B _ri_ haspati then hasted to Savit _ri_\nfor his impulsion,--for, assuredly, Savit _ri_ is the impeller of the gods,--\nand said, \'Impel this for me!\' and Savit _ri_ , the impeller, impelled it for\nhim; and, impelled by Savit _ri_ , it did not injure him; so now also this one\n(the Brahman) hastes to Savit _ri_ for his impulsion,--for, assuredly, Savit\n_ri_ is the impeller of the gods,--and says \'impel this for me!\' and Savit\n_ri_ , the impeller, impels it for him; and, impelled by Savit _ri_ , it does\nnot injure him.\n\n1:7:4:1515\\. He eats 2 the fore-portion, with the text (Va;. S. II, 11 d),\n\'With Agni\'s mouth I eat thee!\' for Agni, assuredly, it does not injure in any\nway; and so neither does it injure him (the Brahman).\n\n1:7:4:1616\\. He must not chew it with his teeth: \'lest this power of Rudra\nshould injure my teeth!\' so (he thinks), and therefore he must not chew it\nwith his teeth.\n\n1:7:4:1717\\. He then rinses his mouth with water;--water is (a means of)\npurification: hence he purifies himself with water, (that is, a means of)\npurification. After he has rinsed the vessel 3,--\n\np. 214\n\n1:7:4:1818\\. They bring him the Brahman\'s portion 1. The Brahman, in truth,\nsits south of the sacrifice, as its guardian. He sits facing that portion. As\nregards the fore-portion, that they have already brought to him and he has\neaten it. In the Brahman\'s portion which they now bring to him, he obtains his\nown share; and henceforth he watches what remains incomplete of the sacrifice:\nfor this reason they bring him the Brahman\'s portion.\n\n1:7:4:1919\\. He (the Brahman) must maintain silence (from the time he takes\nhis seat on being elected) 2 up to that speech (of the Adhvaryu), \'Brahman,\nshall I step forward?\' Those (priests) who, in the midst of the sacrifice,\nperform the i _d_ a, which represents the domestic offerings (pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\na) 3, tear the sacrifice to pieces, injure it. Now the Brahman, assuredly, is\nthe best physician: hence the Brahman thereby restores the sacrifice; but, if\nhe were to sit there talking, he would not restore it: he must therefore\nmaintain silence.\n\n1:7:4:2020\\. If he should utter any human sound before that time, let him\nthere and then mutter some _Ri_ _k_ or Ya _g_ us-text addressed to Vish _n_ u;\nfor Vish _n_ u is\n\np. 215\n\nthe sacrifice, so that he thereby again obtains a hold on the sacrifice: and\nthis is the expiation of that (breach of silence).\n\n1:7:4:2121\\. When he (the Adhvaryu) says, \'Brahman, shall I step forward?\' the\nBrahman mutters thus (Va _g_. S. II, 12), \'This thy sacrifice, O divine Savit\n_ri_ , they have announced . . .,\'--thereby he has recourse to Savit _ri_ for\nhis impulsion (prasava), for he is the impeller (prasavit _ri_ ) of the\ngods;--\'to B _ri_ haspati, the Brahman,\'--for B _ri_ haspati, assuredly, is\nthe Brahman of the gods: hence he announces that (sacrifice) to him who is the\nBrahman of the gods; and accordingly he says, \'to B _ri_ haspati, the\nBrahman.\'--\'Therefore prosper the sacrifice, prosper the lord of sacrifice,\nprosper me!\' In this there is nothing that requires explanation.\n\n1:7:4:2222\\. [He continues, Va _g_. S. II, 13]: \'May his mind delight in the\ngushing (of the) butter 1!\' By the mind, assuredly, all this (universe) is\nobtained (or pervaded, aptam): hence he thereby obtains this All by the\nmind.--\'May B _ri_ haspati spread (carry through) this sacrifice! May he\nrestore the sacrifice uninjured!\'--he thereby restores what was torn\nasunder.--\'May all the gods rejoice here!\'--\'all the gods,\' doubtless, means\nthe All: hence he thereby restores (the sacrifice) by means of the All. He may\nadd, \'Step forward!\' if he choose; or, if he choose, he may omit it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[209:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_483) For other versions of this legend about Pra _g_\napati (Brahman)\'s illicit passion for his daughter, which, as Dr. Muir\nsuggests, probably refers to some atmospheric phenomenon, see Ait. Br. III,\n33, and Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. VIII, 2, 10; cf. Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, IV,\np. 45; I, p. 107. See also _S_ at. Br. II, 1, 2, 9, with note.\n\n[209:2](sbe1233.htm#fr_484) The construction here is irregular. Perhaps this\nis part of the speech of the gods, being a kind of indirect address to Rudra\nin order to avoid naming the terrible god. Dr. Muir translates: The gods said,\n"This god, who rules over the beasts, commits a transgression in that he acts\nthus to his own daughter, our sister: pierce him through."\' In the Ka _n_ va\nMS. some words seem to have been omitted at this particular place. According\nto the Ait. Br., the gods created a god Bhutavat, composed of the most fearful\nforms of theirs. After piercing the incarnation of Pra _g_ apati\'s sin, he\nasked, and obtained, the boon that he should henceforth be the ruler of\ncattle.\n\n[209:3](sbe1233.htm#fr_485) Viz., Rig-veda X, 61, 7, where verses 5-7 contain\nthe first allusion to this legend.\n\n[209:4](sbe1233.htm#fr_486) The agnimaruta is one of the _s_ astras recited at\nthe evening libation of the Soma-sacrifice; and made up chiefly of a hymn\naddressed to Agni Vai _s_ vanara and one to the Maruts; and [following the\nstotriya and anurupa pragatha] a hymn to _G_ atavedas; [and one to the \xc3\x82pas,\nfollowed by various detailed p. 210 verses or couplets]; viz., Rig-veda III,\n3, \'vai _s_ vanaraya p _ri_ thupa _g_ ase,\' &c., and I, 87, \'pratvakshasa _h_\npratavaso,\' &c.; [Rig-veda I, 168, 1-2, stotriya; VII, 16, II-32, anurupa];\nand Rig-veda I, 143, \'pratavyasim navyasim,\' &c. (and X, 9, \'apo hi sh _th_ a\nmayobhuvas,\' &c.) respectively, at the Agnish _t_ oma (and first day of the\ndvada _s_ aha). See \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. V, 20, 5; Ait. Br. III, 35; IV, 30.\n\n[210:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_487) According to Ait. Br. III, 35, where this legend\nis also given in connection with the agnimaruta _s_ astra, Agni Vai _s_\nvanara, aided by the Maruts, stirred (and heated) the seed; and out of it\nsprang successively \xc3\x82ditya (the sun), Bh _ri_ gu, and the \xc3\x82dityas; whilst the\ncoals (a\xe1\xb9\x85gara) remaining behind became the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, and B _ri_ haspati, and\nthe coal dust, the burnt earth and ashes were changed into various kinds of\nanimals. According to Harisvamin it would seem that our passage has to he\nunderstood to the effect that the composition of the agnimaruta _s_ astra\nshows the order of beings which the gods caused to spring forth from the seed.\nSee also IV, 5, I, 8.\n\n[210:2](sbe1233.htm#fr_488) See note on I, 7, 4, 18.\n\n[210:3](sbe1233.htm#fr_489) \'Nirdadaha.\' The Kaushit. Br. VI, 10 (Ind. Stud.\nII, 306) and Yaska Nir. 1 2, 14 have nir _g_ aghana, \'it knocked out his\neyes.\' The Kaushit. Br. also makes them first take the pra _s_ itra to Savit\n_ri_ , and when it cut his hands, they gave him two golden ones.\n\n[211:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_490) _K_ aru, in the ordinary sense of the word, is a\npotful of rice (barley, &c.) grains boiled, or rather steamed\n(antarushmapakva), so as to remain whole, as in Indian curry. Cf. Weber, Ind.\nStud. IX, p. 216.\n\n[211:2](sbe1233.htm#fr_491) According to Kaushit. Br. VI, 10, they took it\nfrom Pushan to Indra, as the mightiest and-strongest of the gods; and he\nappeased it with prayer (brahman); whence the Brahman (in taking the pra _s_\nitra) says, \'Indra is Brahman.\' Weber, Ind. Stud. II, p. 307.\n\n[211:3](sbe1233.htm#fr_492) The consistent use of derivations from one and the\nsame root (pra-su) in this and similar passages is, of course, quite as\nartificial in Sanskrit as must be any imitation of it in English.\n\n[211:4](sbe1233.htm#fr_493) He thereby averts the evil effects of the act\nwhich is connected with Rudra, \'the terrible god;\' see [p.\n2](sbe1203.htm#page_2), note [2](sbe1203.htm#fn_84). Besides, the i _d_ a with\nwhich he now proceeds representing the cattle, he thereby guards the cattle\nfrom the rudriya, cf. above I, 7, 3, 21.\n\n[211:5](sbe1233.htm#fr_494) See I, 8, 1, 12, 13.\n\n[212:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_495) According to Katy. III, 4, 7, the pra _s_ itra, or\n(Brahman\'s) fore-portion, is to be of the size of a barley-corn or a pippala\n(Ficus Religiosa) berry.\n\n[212:2](sbe1233.htm#fr_496) There is no indication in the text of two\ndifferent practices being here referred to. The Ka _n_ va recension, however,\nputs in here, \'but let him not do so,\' which is evidently understood in our\ntext also.\n\n[212:3](sbe1233.htm#fr_497) Viz. in the pra _s_ itrahara _n_ a, or pan which\nis to receive the Brahman\'s portion. The hollow part of the vessel is to be\neither of the shape of a (hand-)mirror, i.e. with a round bowl, or of that of\na _k_ amasa or jug, i.e. with a square bowl ([p. 7](sbe1203.htm#page_7), note\n[1](sbe1203.htm#fn_90)). Katy. I, 3, 40, 42. On the underlayer\' of butter, see\nI, 7, 2, 8.\n\n[212:4](sbe1233.htm#fr_498) \'Tiryag evaina _m_ nirmimite.\' I am in doubt as to\nwhether p. 213 enam (which is omitted in the Ka _n_ va text) really refers to\nRudra\'s dart. Cf. par. 9.\n\n[213:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_499) According to Katy. II, 2, 15, he first looks at\nit, with the text (Va _g_. S. p. 58): \'With Mitra\'s eye I look on thee!\'\n\n[213:2](sbe1233.htm#fr_500) According to Katy. II, 2, 17, he previously puts\nit down on the shoulder of the altar, with the text (Va _g_. S. p. 58), \'I put\nyou down, on the navel of the earth, in the lap of Aditi!\' According to 19,\nhowever, this is optional (except when the Brahman does not eat the pra _s_\nitra immediately).\n\n[213:3](sbe1233.htm#fr_501) According to Katy. II, 2, 20, the Brahman, having\nrinsed the p. 214 vessel [or, according to the comment, the two pra _s_\nitrahara _n_ a, one of which is used as lid to the other], touches his navel,\nwith the text (Va _g_. S. p. 58), \'May the deities there are in the waters\npurify this! Enter the stomach of Indra, being offered with "Hail!" Mix not\nwith my food! Settle down above my navel! In Indra\'s stomach I make thee\nsettle!\'\n\n[214:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_502) The Brahman\'s regular portion (brahmabhaga) of the\nsacrificial food is cut, like the pra _s_ itra or fore-portion (which\napparently he receives as the representative of B _ri_ haspati), from Agni\'s\ncake.\n\n[214:2](sbe1233.htm#fr_503) See I, 1, 4, 9.\n\n[214:3](sbe1233.htm#fr_504) According to the scholiast, it represents the\npakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a or domestic (cooked) offerings, because at the latter, as in\nthe i _d_ a, the remains of the offerings are eaten.\n\n[215:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_505) ? \'Mano _g_ utir [ _g_ yotir, Ka _n_ va rec.] _g_\nushatam a _g_ yasya.\' I am inclined to read _g_ uter [cf. Ath.-veda XIX, 58,\n1: gh _ri_ tasya _g_ uti _h_ samana]. Mahidhara interprets: \'May the rushing\n(eager) mind devote itself to the butter!\' Hillebrandt, Neu- and\nVollmondsopfer, p. 135, apparently proposes to combine mano _g_ utir \'des\nGeistes Schnelligkeit.\' Perhaps _g_ ushatam has to be taken in a transitive\nsense: \'May the gushing of the butter delight the mind.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 8, 1.
