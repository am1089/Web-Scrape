My lord!  \nWhile wood and hill and valley sent  \nIn echoes back the shrill lament.  \nThen on a low and sandy isle  \nWas reared the hero's funeral pile  \nBy crowds of toiling Vanars, where  \nThe mountain stream ran fresh and fair.  \nThe Vanar chiefs, a noble band,  \nHad laid the litter on the sand,  \nAnd stood a little space apart,  \nEach mourning in his inmost heart.  \nBut Tara, when her weeping eye  \nSaw Bali, on the litter lie,  \nLaid his dear head upon her lap,  \nAnd wailed aloud her dire mishap;  \n'O mighty Vanar, lord and king,  \nTo whose fond breast brave, and bold,  \nRise, look upon me as of old.  \nRise up, my sovereign, dost thou see  \nA crowd of subjects weep for thee?  \nStill o'er thy face, though breath has fled.  \nThe joyous light of life is spread:  \nThus around the sun, although he set,  \nA crimson glory lingers yet.  \nDeath clad in Rama's form to-day  \nHast dragged thee from the world away.  \nOne shaft from his tremendous bow  \nDooms us to widowhood and woe.  \nHast thou, O Vanar King, no eyes  \nThy weeping wives to recognize,  \nWho for the length of way unmeet  \nHave followed thee with weary feet?  \nYet every moon-faced beauty here  \nBy thee, O King was counted dear.  \nLord of the Vanar race, hast thou  \nNo eyes to see Sugriva now?  \nAbout thee stands in mournful mood  \nA sore-afflicted multitude,  \nAnd Tara and thy lords of state  \nAround their monarch weep and wait,  \nArise my lord, with gentle speech,  \nAs was thy wont, dismissing each,  \nThen in the forest will we play  \nAnd love shall make our spirits gay.'  \n   The Vanar dames raised Tara, drowned  \nIn floods of sorrow, from the ground;  \nAnd Angad with Sugriva's aid,  \nO'erwhelmed with anguish and dismayed,  \nWeeping for his departed sire,  \nPlaced Bali's body on the pyre:  \nThen lit the flame, and round the dead  \nPaced slowly with a mourner's tread.  \nThus with full rites the funeral train.  \nPerformed the service for the slain,  \nThen sought the flowing stream and made  \nLibations to the parted shade.  \nThere, setting Angad first in place,  \nThe chieftains of the Vanar race,  \nWith Tara and Sugriva, shed  \nThe water that delights the dead.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[354:1](ry299.htm#fr_612) The Vanar chief, not to be confounded with Tara.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXVI.: The Coronation.](ry300.htm)\n\n"
