'He who moves about happy in dreams, he is the Self, this is the immortal,\nthe fearless, this is Brahman.'\n\nThen Indra went away satisfied in his heart. But before he had returned to the\nDevas, he saw this difficulty. Although it is true that that self is not\nblind, even if the body is blind, nor lame, if the body is lame, though it is\ntrue that that self is not rendered faulty by the faults of it (the body),\n\n2\\. Nor struck when it (the body) is struck, nor lamed when it is lamed, yet\nit is as if they struck him (the self) in dreams, as if they chased him 1.\n\np. 139\n\n[paragraph continues] He becomes even conscious, as it were, of pain, and\nsheds tears.

Pra\n_g_ apati said to him: 'Maghavat, as you went away satisfied in your heart,\nfor what purpose did you come back?'\n\nHe said: 'Sir, although it is true that that self is not blind even if the\nbody is blind, nor lame, if the body is lame, though it is true that that self\nis not rendered faulty by the faults of it (the body),\n\n4\\. Nor struck when it (the body) is struck, nor lamed when it is lamed, yet\nit is as if they struck him (the self) in dreams, as if they chased him. He\nbecomes even conscious, as it were, of pain, and sheds tears. Therefore I see\nno good in this.'\n\n'So it is indeed, Maghavat,' replied Pra _g_ apati; 'but I shall explain him\n(the true Self) further to you. Live with me another thirty-two years.'\n\nHe lived with him another thirty-two years. Then Pra _g_ apati said:\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[138:1](sbe01170.htm#fr_352) I have adopted the reading vi _k_ _kh_ ayayanti,\nbecause it is the most difficult, and therefore explains most easily the\nvarious corruptions, or it may be emendations, that have crept into the text.\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains vi _k_ _kh_ adayanti by vidravayanti, and this shows that\nhe too must have read vi _k_ _kh_ ayayanti, for he could not have explained vi\n_k_ _kh_ adayanti, which means they uncover or they deprive of their clothing,\nby vidravayanti, they drive away. It is true that vi _k_ _kh_ ayayanti may be\nexplained in two ways; it may be the causative of _kh_ a, to cut, but this\nmeaning is not very appropriate here, p. 139 and quite inadmissible in another\npassage where vi _k_ _kh_ ayayanti occurs, whereas, if derived from vi _kh_\n(\xe1\xbd\x80\xce\xaf\xcf\x87\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xce\xb1\xce\xb9) in a causative sense, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara could hardly have chosen a better\nexplanation than vidravayanti, they make run away. The root vi _kh_ , vi _k_\n_kh_ ayayati is recognised in Pa _n_ ini III, 1, 28, and in the Dhatupa _th_ a\n28, 129, but it has hitherto been met with in this passage only, and in B _ri_\nhadara _n_ yaka, Up. IV, 3, 20. Here also the author speaks of a man who\nimagines that people kill him or do him violence, or that an elephant chases\nhim or that he falls into a pit. Here we have hastiva vi _k_ _kh_ ayayati, and\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, at least as printed by Dr. Roer, explains this by vi _k_ _kh_\napayati, vi _k_ _kh_ adayati, vidravayati; dhavatity artha _h_. Much better is\nDvivedaganga's commentary, as published by Dr. Weber, Satap. Brahm. p. 1145,\nKada _k_ id ena _m_ hasti vi _k_ _kh_ ayayativa vidravayativa; vi _kh_ a\ngatau, gupudhupavi _kh_ ipa _n_ ipanibhya aya iti (Pa _n_. III, 1, 28) svartha\nayapratyaya _h_. In the Dictionary of Boehtlingk and Roth the derivation from\n_kh_ a, to cut, is preferred; see Nachtrage, s. v. _kh_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 11](sbe01171.htm)\n\n"
