Savitri said :-- \xc2\x93O Dharmarajan! O Highly Fortunate One! O Thou! Expert\nin the Vedas and the Amgas thereof! Now kindly describe that which is the\nessence of the various Pura _n_ as and Itihasas, which is the quintessence,\nwhich is dear to all, approved of by all, which is the seed by which the\nKarmic ties are cut asunder, which is high, noble and happy is this life.\nKindly describe the above by which man can acquire all his desires, and what\nis the only source of all the good and auspicious things. All by knowing which\nman has\n\n\n\np. 943\n\n\n\nnot to face any dangers or troubles, nor has he to go to the dreadful hells\nthat thou hast severally just now described and that by which men can be freed\nof those various wombs. Kindly now describe all these. O Bhagavan! What is the\nsize of the several ku _nd_ as or hells that Thou hast just now enumerated?\nHow do the sinners dwell there? When a man departs, his body is reduced to\nashes. Then of what sort is that other body by which the sinners enjoy the\neffects of their Karmas and why do not those bodies get destroyed when they\nsuffer so much pains for so long a time? What sort of body is that? Kindly\ndescribe all these to me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n8-33. Naraya _n_ a spoke :-- Hearing the questions put forward by Savitri,\nDharmaraja remembered S\xc2\x92ri Hari and began to speak on subject that sever the\nbonds of Karma :-- O Child! O One of good vows! In the four Vedas, in all the\nbooks on Dharma, (Smritis) in all the Samhitas, all the Itihasas, all the Pura\n_n_ as, in the Narada Pa\xc3\xb1charatram, in the other Dharma S\xc2\x92astras and in the\nVedangas, it is definitely stated that the worship of the Pa\xc3\xb1cha Devatas (the\nfive Devatas) S\xc2\x92iva, S\xc2\x92akti Vi _sn_ u, Ganes\xc2\x92a, and Surya is the best, the\nhighest, the destroyer of the old age, disease, death, evils and sorrows, the\nmost auspicious and leading to the highest bliss. In fact, the worship of\nthese Pa\xc3\xb1cha Devatas is the source of acquiring all the Siddhis (the success)\nand saves one from going to the hells. From their worship springs the Bhaktic\nTree and then and then only the Root of the Tree of all Karmic bonds is\nsevered for ever and ever. This is the step to Mukti (final liberation) and is\nthe indestructible state. By this one can get Salokya, Sar _st_ i, Sarupya,\nand Samipya, the different state of beatitudes in which the soul (1) resides\nin the same world with the Deity, (2) possesses the same station, condition,\nor rank, or equality with the Supreme Being in power and all the Divine\nattributes (the last of the four grades of Mukti), (3) possesses the sameness\nof form or gets assimilated to the Deity or (4) gets intimately united,\nidentified or absorbed into the Deity. O Auspicious One! The worshipper of\nthese five Devatas has never to see any of the hells, watched by My\nmessengers. Those who are devoid of the devotion to the Devi see My abode; but\nthose who go to the Tirthas of Hari, who hold Harivasaras (festivities on the\ndays of Hari) who bow down at the feet of Hari and worship Hari, never come to\nMy abode named Samyamana. Those Brahma _n_ as that are purified by their\nperforming the three Sandhyas and by the following the pure \xc3\x82charas (customs\nand observances), those that find no pleasure until they worship the Devi,\nthose that are attached to their own Dharmas and their own \xc3\x82charas, never come\nto My abode.\n\n\n\np. 944\n\n\n\nMy terrible messengers, seeing the devotees of S\xc2\x92iva, run away out of terror\nas snakes run away terrified by Garu _d_ a. I also order My messengers with\nnooses in their hands never to go to them. My messengers go mostly to other\npersons than the servants of Hari. No sooner do My Messengers see the\nworshippers of the Kri _sn_ a Mantra, than they run away as snakes get\nterrified at the sight of Garu _d_ a. Chitragupta, too, one of the beings in\nYama\xc2\x92s world, recording the vices and virtues of mankind, strike off the names\nof the Devi worshippers, out of fear and prepare Madhuparka, etc., for them (a\nmixture of honey; respectful offering made to a guest or to the bridegroom on\nhis arrival at the door of the father of the bride). They rise higher than the\nBrahma Lokas and go to the Devi\xc2\x92s abode, i.e., to Ma _n_ idvipa. Those that\nare the worshippers of the S\xc2\x92akti Mantra and are highly fortunate, whose\ncontact removes the sins of others, they deliver the thousand generations\n(from the downward course). As bundles and bundles of dry grasses become burnt\nto ashes, no sooner they are thrown into fire, so the delusion at once becomes\nitself deluded at the sight of the forms of those devotees. At their sight,\nlust, anger, greed, disease, sorrow, old age, death, fear, Kala (time that\ntakes away the life of persons), the good and bad karmas, pleasures and\nenjoyments drop off to a great distance. O Fair One! Now I have described to\nyou the states of those persons that are not under the control of Kala, good\nand bad karmas, pleasures and enjoyments, etc., and those that do not suffer\nthose pains. Now I am speaking of this visible body. Listen. Earth, water,\nfire, air, and ether are the five Maha Bhutas (the great elements); these are\nthe seeds of this visible body of the person and are the chief factors in the\nwork of creation. The body that is made up of earth and other elements is\ntransient and artificial, i.e., that body becomes burnt to ashes. Within this\nvisible body, bound, is there a Puru _s_ a of the size of a thumb; that is\ncalled the Jiva Puru _s_ a; the subtle Jiva assumes those subtle bodies for\nenjoying the effects of karmas. In My world, that subtle body is not burnt by\nthe burning fire. If that subtle body be immersed in water, if that be beaten\nincessantly or if it be struck by a weapon or pierced by a sharp thorn, that\nbody is not destroyed. That body is not burnt nor broken by the burning hot\nand molten material, by the red hot iron, by hot stones by embracing a hot\nimage or by falling into a burning cauldron. That body has to suffer incessant\npains. O Fair One! Thus I have dwelt on the subject of the several bodies and\nthe causes thereof according to the S\xc2\x92astras. Now I will describe to you the\ncharacters of all the other Ku _nd_ as. Listen.\n\n\n\np. 945\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty-sixth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the destruction of the\nfear of the Yama of those who are the worshippers of the Five Devatas, in the\nMaha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 37](bk09ch37.htm)\n\n'
