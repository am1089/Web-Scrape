Also in the case of those outside, as this is seen.\n\np. 704\n\nIt has been declared that the members of the four a _s_ ramas have a claim to\nthe knowledge of Brahman, and that the duties connected with each a _s_ rarna\npromote knowledge. A doubt now arises whether those men also who, on account\nof poverty and so on, stand outside the a _s_ ramas are qualified for the\nknowledge of Brahman, or rtot.--They are not, the Purvapakshin holds, since\nsuch knowledge is to be attained in a way dependent on the special duties of\neach a _s_ rama; while those who do not belong to an a _s_ rama are not\nconcerned with a _s_ rama duties.--This view the Sutra rejects. Those also who\ndo not stand within any a _s_ rama are qualified for knowledge, 'because that\nis seen,' i.e. because the texts declare that men such as Raikva, Bhishma, Sa\n_m_ varta and others who did not belong to a _s_ rama were well grounded in\nthe knowledge of Brahman. It can by no means be maintained that it is a _s_\nrama duties only that promote knowledge; for the text 'by gifts, by penance,\nby fasting, and so on' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22) distinctly declares that\ncharity also and other practices, which are not confined to the a _s_ ramas,\nare helpful towards knowledge. In the same way as in the case of those bound\nto chastity--who, as the texts show, may possess the knowledge of Brahman--\nknowledge is promoted by practices other than the Agnihotra and the like, so--\nit is concluded--in the case of those also who do not belong to any abrama\nknowledge may be promoted by certain practices not exclusively connected with\nany a _s_ rama, such as prayer, fasting, charity, propitiation of the\ndivinity, and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 37.
