(Should it be said that the soul does) not (follow the rays) by night;\n(we reply) not so, because the connexion (of veins and rays) exists as long as\nthe body; and (scripture) also declares this.\n\nIt might perhaps be said that the veins and rays are connected during the day,\nso that the soul of a person who dies during the day may follow those rays;\nbut not the soul of one who dies by night when the connexion of the veins and\nrays is broken.--But this is a mistaken assumption, because the connexion of\nrays and veins lasts as long as the body exists. This scripture also declares,\n'They (the rays) stretch out from yonder sun and slip into these veins; they\nstretch from these veins and slip into yonder sun' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 6, 2). We\nmoreover observe that the rays of the sun continue to exist in the nights of\nthe summer season; for we feel their warmth and other effects. During the\nnights of the other seasons they are difficult to perceive because then few\nonly continue to exist; just as during the cloudy days of the cold season.--\nThis the following scriptural passage also shows,' Day he makes in the night.'\n--If, moreover, he who dies at night mounted upwards without following the\nrays, the following of the rays would be generally meaningless. For the text\ngives no special direction to the effect that he who dies by day mounts\nupwards by means of the rays, while he who dies by night mounts without them.\n--Should, on the other hand, even he who knows be prevented from mounting\nupwards, by the mere mischance of dying by night, knowledge would in that case\nproduce its fruit eventually only, and the consequence would be that--as the\ntime of death is not\n\np. 380\n\nfixed--nobody would apply himself to knowledge.--If, again, a man dying at\nnight should wait for the dawn (to mount upwards), it might happen that, owing\nto the action of the funeral fire, &c., his body would, at the time of\ndaybreak, not be capable of entering into connexion with the rays. Scripture\nmoreover expressly says that he does not wait, 'As quickly as he sends off the\nmind he goes to the sun' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 6, 5).--For all these reasons the\nsoul follows the rays by night as well as by day.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 20](sbe38300.htm)\n\n"
