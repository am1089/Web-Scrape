He never revealed his wish to any man, but ere he\nproclaimed the swayamvara of Draupadi, he thought of the great Pandava archer,\nand caused to be made a powerful bow which only a strong man could bend and\nstring. For a target he had constructed a strange and curious device: a high\npole was erected, and it was surmounted by a golden fish, which was poised\nabove a swiftly-revolving wheel. Then Drupada issued a proclamation far and\nwide summoning the regents and princes of the world to the swayamvara. He\nsaid: "The man who will bend the bow and shoot an arrow through the wheel\nwhich will strike and bring down the golden fish shall obtain my daughter in\nmarriage." None but a mighty archer who was Arjuna\'s equal could hope to win\nthe beautiful Draupadi, for five arrows only were allowed to each competitor,\nand the fish must needs be struck on an eye to be brought down.\n\np. 214\n\nA great field was enclosed for the swayamvara. It was surrounded by a fosse\nand barrier and swan-white pavilions, with domes and turrets that were agleam\nwith gold and jewels, festoons and streamers and bright gar-lands. The turrets\nof the royal mansion were lofty and golden like Himalayan mountain peaks.\n\nFor sixteen days there were sports and banquets, and everyone within the city\nmade merry. Then came the great and festal day. At dawn trumpets and drums\nawakened the people, and flags and flowers decorated every street. The whole\npopulace gathered on the plain and massed around the barriers. The rajah\'s\nsoldiers kept order, and wrestlers and jugglers and dancers and musicians\nperformed merrily until the appointed hour drew nigh.\n\nAt length the people roared their welcome to the king and the high-born ladies\nand all the royal guests, who thronged the galleries and pavilions. The mighty\nrajahs, frowning defiance one upon another, were ranged on lofty seats round\nthe throne of King Drupada. Multitudes had gathered to gaze on the glittering\nscene, pressing against the barriers, or clustering on trees and scaffolds,\nwhile others looked down from lofty lattice and high house roofs. . . . A\nthousand trumpets clamoured; and the murmuring of the swaying people was like\nthe voice of the heaving main.\n\nAmong others came in all her beauty the Princess Draupadi, stepping gently and\nsweet, bearing in a delicate hand the golden bridal garland, which was adorned\nwith sparkling gems. Tardily she made approach, blushing with increasing\nloveliness, and appeared in the presence of the princes. Mighty and high-born\nmen were there. The Pandavas beheld in the galleries their enemies Duryodhana,\nKarna, and all the great Kauravas, and they\n\np. 215\n\nsaw also Krishna, the amorous and powerful one, and his brother, the wine-\ndrinking Balarama 1, the Yadava princes, the Rajah of Sindhu and his sons, the\nRajah of Chedi, the Rajah of Kosala, the Rajah of Madra, and many more. Now\nthe Pandavas were still disguised as Brahmans, and stood among the holy men.\n\nAn aged and white-haired Brahman, clad in white, approached the high altar,\nchanting mantras. He spread the holy grass and poured out oil; then he kindled\nthe sacred fire, and the offering to the gods was blessed.\n\nThereafter the thousand trumpets were sounded, and a tense silence fell upon\nthe buzzing crowd. In the solemn hush all eyes were turned towards the royal\nmansion as Drupada\'s valiant son, Dhrishta-dyumna, led forth his sister\nDraupadi, and in a voice like thunder proclaimed his father\'s will, saying:\n\n"Here stands the noble princess, my sister. Whosoever can bend this bow, and\nstrike with an arrow yonder whirling target set on high, may, if his lineage\nis noble, claim Draupadi for his bride. My words are truth!"\n\nHaving spoken thus, the prince recited to his sister the names of the royal\nguests, their lineage and their deeds of fame, and bade her award the golden\ngarland to the successful archer.\n\nThe rajahs then descended from their gorgeous thrones and gathered around\nDraupadi as the bright gods gather around Parvati, the mountain bride of\nShiva. Their hearts were filled with love for the maiden and with hate for one\nanother. Rivals frowned upon rivals. Those who had been close friends became\nof a sudden angry enemies because that Draupadi was so beautiful. Krishna\n\np. 216\n\nand Balarama alone remained aloof; calmly and self-restrained they stood\napart, while rajah opposed rajah like to angry elephants.\n\nEach of the love-sick monarchs gazed upon the mighty bow and upon the whirling\ntarget on high, and for a time no man sought to lift the bow lest he should be\nunable to bend it and then be put to shame. At length a rajah, more bold than\nthe others, picked it up and tried his strength without avail; another\nfollowed and another, but failed to string it. Soon many rajahs strained their\narms in vain, and some fell upon the ground and groaned, while the laughter of\nthe people pealed around the barriers. . . . The gods had assembled in mid-air\nand looked down with steadfast eyes.\n\nAt length proud Karna strode forward; he took the bow and bent it and fixed\nthe bowstring. Then he seized an arrow. Drupada and his son were alarmed,\nfearing he might succeed and claim the bride. Suddenly Draupadi intervened,\nfor she would not have the son of a charioteer for her lord. She said,\nspeaking loudly: "I am a king\'s daughter, and will not wed with the base-born.\n. . ."\n\nKarna smiled bitterly, his face aflame. He cast down the bow and walked away,\ngazing towards the sun. He said: "O sun! be my witness that I cast aside the\nbow, not because I am unable to hit the mark, but because Draupadi scorns me."\n\nOthers sought to perform the feat, but in vain, and many rajahs feared to make\nattempt lest they should compel the laughter of the people. A buzz of merry\nvoices arose from beyond the barriers.\n\nMeanwhile the Pandava brethren, disguised as Brahmans, looked on with the\nothers.\n\nThen suddenly silence fell upon everyone, for Arjuna\n\np. 217\n\nadvanced from the priestly band to lift the bow. The Brahmans applauded him,\nshaking their deerskins.\n\nSaid the rajahs: "Can a weakly Brahman, who is a mere stripling, accomplish a\nfeat which is beyond the strength of mighty warriors."\n\nOthers said: "The Brahman knoweth best his own skill. He would not go forward\nif he were not confident of success."\n\nAn aged priest endeavoured to restrain Arjuna, lest he should by his failure\nbring ridicule upon the Brahmans; but the hero would not be thwarted. He\nstrode forward like to a stately elephant and bared his broad shoulders and\nample chest. He was nimble as a lion, and calm and self-possessed.\n\nEre he lifted the bow, he walked round it; then he addressed a prayer to the\ngods. . . . He stood up unmoved and serene as a mountain peak, and he bent the\nbow and fixed an arrow in it. . . .\n\nAll eyes watched him. He drew the cord, and the arrow flew upwards with a\nhissing sound; it hit the target eye, and the golden fish fell over and\nclashed upon the ground.\n\nLike distant thunder arose the plaudits of the multitude; hundreds of Brahmans\nshouted in ecstasy and waved their scarfs; a thousand trumpets clamoured in\ntriumph, and the drums were beaten loud. . . .\n\nThe heart of Draupadi was filled with joy, and, smiling coyly, she advanced\ntowards Arjuna and flung the golden bridal garland over his shoulders.\nCelestial blossoms fluttered, descending through the air, and the sound of\ncelestial music was heard.\n\nDrupada was well pleased, because he had already recognized the hero in his\nBrahman guise; but the jealous rajahs stormed in fury, and each said unto the\nother:\n\np. 218\n\n[paragraph continues] "Behold! the king goeth to greet this youth. To him we\nare as worthless as jungle grass; he tramples upon us in his pride. . . . Are\nwe to be humbled by a Brahman and denied the fruit of our nourished hopes? The\ndaughter of a rajah must even choose a Kshatriya for her husband. . . .\nVerily, the life of a priest is sacred, but the rajah who scorns his peers\nmust die--he and his son together. Let us seize also this shameless woman who\nhonours the Brahman--that trespasser of our birthright--so that she may be\nburned at the stake!"\n\nShouting with anger one to another, the rajahs poured from the galleries with\ndrawn swords and rushed towards Arjuna and the princess. Like ponderous wild\nelephants they advanced; but the Pandavas rose against them. Arjuna bent the\ngreat bow, and Bhima, having no weapon, uprooted a tree and stood defying them\nlike to hell\'s stern judge wielding his mighty club. Yudhishthira and the\nyounger brothers were soon beside them, and the Brahmans hastened also to give\ntheir aid.\n\nFor a moment the rajahs paused, wondering at the daring of the priestly band;\nbut impatient Karna and angry Salya, Rajah of Madra, dashed forward like to\ninfuriated elephants against Arjuna and Bhima. The brothers sustained the\nshock, and when Karna had been struck by Arjuna, he faltered in amaze and\nsaid: "Brahman, who art thou? Art thou a god in human guise? No Brahman could\nthus attack me, nor dost there live a man who can thwart me with defiance as\nthou hast done even now, save Arjuna alone."\n\nSaid Arjuna, "I am nor god nor hero, but a humble Brahman who hath been\ntrained to use of arms. I have come hither to tame thy pride, thou haughty\nyouth; therefore be firm."\n\np. 219\n\nBut Karna fell back, deeming it vain to oppose the power of a holy man.\n\nMeanwhile Madra\'s king fought against peerless Bhima. Both were long-armed and\nof gigantic strength. Sharp and fierce was their conflict. When their clubs\nwere splintered, they leapt one upon the other and wrestled fiercely,\nstruggling with all their might. Then, of a sudden, Bhima stopped and swung\naloft the mighty rajah and threw him heavily upon the ground, where he lay\nunconscious and bleeding before the eyes of the multitude.\n\nThe rajahs drew back, humbled because of Karna\'s flight and Salya\'s downfall.\n\n"Brave, indeed, are the Brahmans," they said. "Who can they be? What is their\nlineage? and whence come they?"\n\nThe Pandavas scorned to make answer. But Krishna had knowledge of who they\nwere, and he interposed with gentle words to soothe the angry rajahs. The\nmonarchs heard him and withdrew, and the tumult was appeased.\n\nThen Arjuna took Draupadi by the hand and led her away in peace from that\nscene of angry strife. So ended the swayamvara, and Krishna declared that the\nbride had been fairly won.\n\nThe Pandava brethren went towards the house of the potter, and they entered\nand addressed their mother Pritha, saying: "A great gift have we obtained this\nday."\n\nSaid Pritha: "Then share the gift between you, as becomes brethren."\n\nYudhishthira said: "What hast thou said, O mother? The gift is the Princess\nDraupadi whom Arjuna hath won at the swayamvara."\n\nSaid Pritha: "Alas! what have I said? I have sinned deeply in saying, \'Then\nshare the gift between you, as\n\np. 220\n\nbecomes brethren.\' But, O Yudhishthira, my son, the fatal words have been\nspoken; you must devise how they can be obeyed without involving one another\nin wrong."\n\nYudhishthira pondered a time and then spake to Arjuna, saying: "My brother,\nthou hast won Draupadi by thine own merit. She must therefore be thy bride."\n\nSaid Arjuna: "Thou, Yudhishthira, art our elder brother and we are thy\nservants. The princess is for thee."\n\nYudhishthira said: "Let this matter be arranged in accordance with the will of\nthe gods. It is for Drupada to say unto which of us his daughter will be\ngiven."\n\nNow, as hath already been told, each one of the Pandavas yearned in his secret\nheart to have Draupadi for his bride. . . .\n\nMeanwhile the evening meal had been prepared, and Pritha desired that the\nprincess should at once take her place, and serve out the portions to the\nbrethren. So she said unto Draupadi: "Divide the food, and first set aside a\nshare for the poor; then cut what is left into two parts, one part for Bhima,\nand the rest for my other sons and for thee and me."\n\nThe princess smiled when she beheld the great meal which Bhima devoured.\n\nWhen they had all eaten they retired to rest. Draupadi slept with Pritha, and\nthe brethren lay at their feet.\n\nKing Drupada was sore troubled in heart after his daughter had been led away\nto the potter\'s house, and he sent his valiant son to watch her. Dhrishta-\ndyumna went forth in disguise, and, listening at the window, he discovered to\nhis joy that the Brahmans were no other than the Pandava brethren. He returned\nto his royal sire and related all that had happened, and what had been\n\np. 221\n\nspoken at the evening meal. The king was well pleased because that the\nbrethren were Kshatriyas and not Brahmans.\n\nIn the morning Drupada sent a priest to the potter\'s house to ask how it fared\nwith all the brethren.\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "Inform thou the rajah that his daughter hath been won by a\nfamily who will not bring shame or disgrace upon his royal name. None but a\nman of high birth could have shot down the fish of gold."\n\nDrupada, ere this message was delivered unto him, sent a second messenger\nbidding the brethren to come to the palace because that the nuptial feast was\nready. . . . Two chariots awaited them. Then Pritha and Draupadi entered one\nof the chariots together, and the five brethren entered the other, and they\nwere all driven towards the royal palace.\n\nWhen the people beheld the Pandavas and marked their comely bearing and royal\ngait, they knew that they were not Brahmans, but high-born Kshatriyas.\n\nThe Pandava guests were made welcome, and the king and his son and all his\ncounsellors sat down to feast with them.\n\nSaid the rajah at length unto Yudhishthira: "I perceive that you are men of\nhigh birth. Tell me, therefore, I pray thee, who ye are--your names and your\nlineage."\n\nYudhishthira said: "We are of humble birth. Do now with us as is thy desire."\n\nSaid Drupada: "In Indra\'s name, I adjure thee to reveal yourselves unto me\nnow."\n\nYudhishthira said: "Know, then, that we are the Pandava princes. . . . Our\nbrother Arjuna was the winner of Draupadi. Thy daughter, like to a lotus,\n\np. 222\n\nhath been but transferred from one lake to another. I have spoken what is\ntrue."\n\nDrupada glowed with joy and satisfaction. He prevailed upon the brethren to\nremain at the palace, and entertained them for many days.\n\nAt length Yudhishthira was addressed by Drupada, who said: "Thou art the elder\nbrother. Speak and say if it is thy desire that Arjuna be given Draupadi for\nhis bride."\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "I would fain speak with Vyasa, the great Rishi, regarding\nthis matter."\n\nNow Vyasa was in the city of Panchala at that time, and he was brought before\nthe rajah, who spake to him regarding Draupadi.\n\nThe Rishi said: "The gods have already declared that she will become the wife\nof all the five Pandava brethren."\n\nDrupada\'s son spoke and said: "With reverence I have heard thy words, O Vyasa,\nbut to me it appears that Draupadi hath been betrothed unto Arjuna alone."\n\nSaid Yudhishthira: "Thou hast spoken truly, but there is wisdom in the words\nof Vyasa which in my heart I cannot condemn. Besides, our mother hath already\ncommanded us to share our gift together."\n\nThen Vyasa told that Draupadi was the re-incarnation of a pious woman who once\nprayed unto the god Shiva for a husband: five times she prayed, and the god\nrewarded her with the promise of five husbands in her next existence. Vyasa\nalso revealed that the Pandava brethren were five incarnations of Indra, and\nthus were but as one.\n\nDrupada then gave consent for his daughter to become the bride of all the\nbrethren, and it was arranged that she should be married unto them all, one\nafter the\n\np. 223\n\nother, according to their ages. So on five successive days she was led round\nthe holy fire by each of the five Pandava princes.\n\nDrupada thereafter conferred great gifts upon his sons-in-law; he gave them\nmuch gold and many jewels, and he gave them numerous horses and chariots and\nelephants, and also a hundred female servants clad in many-coloured robes, and\nadorned with gems and bright garlands. Unto the Pandavas Krishna gave much\nraiment and ornaments of gold, and rare vessels sparkling with jewels, besides\nfemale servants from various kingdoms.\n\nNow when Duryodhana came to know that the Pandava brethren were still alive,\nand had formed a powerful alliance with Drupada, he was moved to jealous\nwrath. A great council was held, at which the young men clamoured for war and\nthe grave elders spoke in favour of peace. At length it was agreed that the\nPandava princes should be invited to return to Hastinapur so that the raj\nmight be divided between them and the sons of Dhritarashtra. Then Vidura was\nsent to Panchala to speak with the Rajah Drupada and his sons-in-law regarding\nthis matter.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[215:1](iml18.htm#fr_245) _Pron_. bal-a-rah\xc2\xb4ma.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIV.
