And, according to some (teachers), also at (the sacrifices) described\nabove (the following rites should be performed).\n\n3\\. He should touch the earth, to the west of the fire, with his two hands\nturned downwards, with (the verse), 'We partake of the earth\xc2\x92s' (MB. II, 4,\n1).\n\np. 115\n\n4\\. In the night-time (he pronounces that Mantra so that it ends with the\nword) 'goods' (vasu), in the day-time (so that it ends) with 'wealth'\n(dhanam).\n\n5\\. With the three verses, 'This praise' (MB. II, 4, 2-4) he should wipe along\n(with his hands) around (the fire).\n\n6. 6 Before sacrifices the Virupaksha formula (MB. II, 4, 6) (should be recited).\n\n7\\. And at (ceremonies) which are connected with special wishes, the Prapada\nformula (MB. II, 4, 5)\xc2\x97(in the following way):\n\n8\\. He should murmur (the Prapada formula), 'Austerities and splendour,'\nshould perform one suppression of breath, and should, fixing his thoughts on\nthe object (of his wish), emit his breath, when beginning the Virupaksha\nformula.\n\n9. 9 When undertaking ceremonies for the obtainment of special wishes, let him fast during three (days and) nights,\n\n10. 10 Or (let him omit) three meals.\n\np. 116\n\n11. 11 At such ceremonies, however, as are repeated regularly, (let him do so only) before their first performance.\n\n12. 12 He should (simply) fast, however, before such ceremonies as are performed on sacrificial days (i.e. on the first day of the fortnight).\n\n13. 13 (At a ceremony) which ought to be performed immediately (after the occurrence by which it has been caused), the consecration follows after (the ceremony itself).\n\n14\\. Let him recite the Prapada formula (Sutras 7. 8), sitting in the forest\non Darbha grass,\n\n15\\. Of which the panicles are turned towards the east, if he is desirous of\nholy lustre,\n\n16\\. To the north, if desirous of sons and of cattle,\n\n17\\. To both directions, if desirous of both.\n\n18\\. One who desires that his stock of cattle may increase, should offer a\nsacrifice of rice and barley\n\np. 117\n\nwith (the verse), 'He who has a thousand arms, the protector of cow-keepers'\n(MB. II, 4, 7).\n\n19\\. Having murmured the Kautomata verse (ibid. 8) over fruits of a big tree,\nhe should give them\xc2\x97\n\n20\\. To a person whose favour he wishes to gain.\n\n21\\. One (fruit) more (than he gives to that person), an even number (of\nfruits), he should keep himself.\n\n22\\. There are the five verses, 'Like a tree' (MB. II, 4, 9-13).\n\n23. 23 With these firstly a ceremony (is performed) for (obtaining property on) the earth.\n\n24\\. He should fast one fortnight,\n\n25\\. Or, if he is not able (to do so, he may drink) once a day rice-water,\n\n26\\. In which he can see his image.\n\n27. 27 This observance (forms part) of (all) fortnightly observances.\n\n28. 28 He then should in the full-moon night plunge up to his navel into a pool which does not dry up, and should sacrifice at the end of (each of those five) verses fried grains with his mouth into the water, with the word Svaha.\n\n29\\. Now (follows) another (ceremony with the same five verses).\n\n30\\. With the first (verse) one who is desirous of the enjoyment (of riches),\nshould worship the sun, within sight of (that) person rich in wealth (from\n\np. 118\n\nwhom he hopes to obtain wealth); then he will obtain wealth.\n\n31\\. With the second (verse) one who desires that his stock of horses and\nelephants may increase, should sacrifice fried grains, while the sun has a\nhalo.\n\n32\\. With the third (verse) one who desires that his flocks may increase,\n(should sacrifice) sesamum seeds, while the moon (has a halo).\n\n33\\. Having worshipped the sun with the fourth (verse), let him acquire\nwealth; then he will come back safe and wealthy.\n\n34\\. Having worshipped the sun with the fifth (verse) let him return to his\nhouse. He will safely return home; he will safely return home.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[114:1](sbe30037.htm#fr_405) 5, 1 seq. Comp. Khadira-G _ri_ hya I, 2, 6 seq.\n\n[115:6](sbe30037.htm#fr_406) 6-8. Khadira-G _ri_ hya I, 2, 23; G _ri_ hya-sa\n_m_ graha I, 96. It is stated that the recitation of the Virupaksha and\nPrapada formulas and also the parisamuhana (Sutra 5) should be omitted at the\nso-called Kshiprahomas, i.e. at sacrifices performed without the assistance of\na ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avid. See Bloomfield's notes on G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha I, 92.\n96. Regarding the way in which a pra _n_ ayama ('suppression of breath') is\nperformed, comp. Vasish _th_ a XXV, 13 (S.B.E. XIV, p. 126).\n\n[115:9](sbe30037.htm#fr_407) 9 seq. Khadira-G _ri_ hya IV, 1, 1 seq.\n\n[115:10](sbe30037.htm#fr_408) There are two meals a day. The words of this\nSutra, 'Or three meals,' are explained in the commentary in the following way.\nHe should, if he does not entirely abstain from food through three days, take\nonly three meals during that time, i.e. he should take one meal a day. The\ncommentator adds that some read abhaktani instead of bhaktani ('or he should\nomit three meals'), in which case the result would be the same. I prefer the\nreading p. 116 bhaktani, and propose to supply, not, 'he should eat,' but 'he\nshould omit' ('abho _g_ anam,' Sutra 9). Possibly the meaning is that three\nsuccessive meals should be omitted; thus also the compiler of the Khadira-G\n_ri_ hya seems to have understood this Sutra.\n\n[116:11](sbe30037.htm#fr_409) Comp., for instance, below, chap. 6, 1.\n\n[116:12](sbe30037.htm#fr_410) Comp. below, chaps. 6, 4; 8, 23.\n\n[116:13](sbe30037.htm#fr_411) My translation of this Sutra differs from the\ncommentary. There it is said: 'An occurrence which is perceived only when it\nhas happened (sannipatitam eva), and of which the cause by which it is\nproduced is unknown, for instance the appearance of a halo, is called\nsannipatika. Such sannipatika ceremonies are uparish _t_ addaiksha. The diksha\nis the preparatory consecration (of the sacrificer), for instance by three\ndays of fasting. A ceremony which has its diksha after itself is called\nuparish _t_ addaiksha.' Similarly the commentary on Khadira-G _ri_ hya IV, 1,\n3 says, 'uparish _t_ at sannipatike naimittike karma k _ri_ tvabho _g_ anam.'\n\n[117:23](sbe30037.htm#fr_412) The commentary explains parthivam, 'p _ri_\nthivyartha _m_ kriyate, iti parthivam, gramakshetradyartham;' similarly the\ncommentary on Khadira-G _ri_ hya IV, 1, 13 says, 'p _ri_\nthivipatitvapraptyartham idam ukta _m_ karma.'\n\n[117:27](sbe30037.htm#fr_413) Comp. below, chap. 6, 12.\n\n[117:28](sbe30037.htm#fr_414) G _ri_ hya-sa _m_ graha II, 11.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 6](sbe30038.htm)\n\n"
