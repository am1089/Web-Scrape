He no longer looks at\nall to the personal reward of his acts; for his heart is full of exultation,\ndrunk with the abounding essence of bliss.\n\nLeaving the path of things known or unknown, he stands in the Self alone; like\na god in presence is this most excellent knower of the Eternal.\n\nThough still in life, yet ever free; his last aim reached; the most excellent\nknower of the Eternal, when his disguise falls off, becoming the Eternal,\nenters into the secondless Eternal.\n\nLike a mimic, who has worn the disguises of wellbeing and ill, the most\nexcellent knower of the Eternal was Brahma all the time, and no other.\n\np. 87\n\nThe body of the sage who has become the Eternal is consumed away, even before\nit has fallen to the ground--like a fresh leaf withered--by the fire of\nconsciousness.\n\nThe sage who stands in the Eternal, the Self of being, ever full, of the\nsecondless bliss of the Self, has none of the hopes fitted to time and space\nthat make for the formation of a body of skin, and flesh, subject to\ndissolution.\n\nPutting off the body is not Freedom, any more than putting away one's staff\nand waterpot; but getting free from the knots of unwisdom in the heart--that\nis Freedom, in very deed.\n\nWhether its leaf fall in a running river, or on holy ground, prepared for\nsacred rites, what odds does it make to the tree for good or ill?\n\nLike the loss of a leaf, or a flower, or a fruit, is the loss of the body, or\npowers, or vital breath, or mind; but the Self itself, ever one's own, formed\nof bliss, is like the tree and stands.\n\nThe divine saying declares the Self to be the assemblage of all consciousness;\nthe real is the actor, and they speak only of the destruction of the disguise\n--unwisdom.\n\n### THE SELF ENDURES\n\n(Verses 562--574)\n\nIndestructible, verily, is the Self--thus says the scripture of the Self,\ndeclaring that it is not destroyed when all its changing vestures are\ndestroyed.\n\nStones, and trees, grass, and corn, and straw are consumed\n\np. 88\n\nby fire, but the earth itself remains the same. So the body, powers, life,\nbreath and mind and all things visible, are burned up by the fire of wisdom,\nleaving the being of the higher Self alone.\n\nAs the darkness, that is its opposite, is melted away in the radiance of the\nsun, so, indeed, all things visible are melted away in the Eternal.\n\nAs, when the jar is broken, the space in it becomes clear space, so, when the\ndisguises melt away, the Eternal stands as the Eternal and the Self.\n\nAs milk poured in milk, oil in oil, water in water, becomes perfectly one, so\nthe sage who knows the Self becomes one with the Self.\n\nThus reaching bodiless purity, mere Being, partless, the being of the Eternal,\nthe sage returns to this world no more.\n\nHe whose forms born of unwisdom are burnt up by knowledge of oneness with the\neverlasting Self, since he has become the Eternal, how could he, being the\nEternal, come to birth again?\n\nBoth bonds and the getting rid of them are works of glamor, and exist not\nreally in the Self; they are like the presence of the imagined serpent and its\nvanishing, in the rope which really does not change.\n\nBinding and getting rid of bondage have to be spoken of because of. the\nexistence, and yet the unreality, of enveloping by unwisdom. But there is no\nenveloping of the Eternal; it is not enveloped because nothing besides the\nEternal exists to envelop it.\n\nThe binding and the getting rid of bondage are both mirages; the deluded\nattribute the work of thought to\n\np. 89\n\nthe thing itself; just as they attribute the cloud-born cutting off of vision\nto the sun; for the unchanging is secondless consciousness, free from every\nclinging stain.\n\nThe belief that bondage of the Real, is, and the belief that it has ceased,\nare both mere things of thought; not of the everlasting Real.\n\nTherefore these two, glamor-built, bondage and the getting rid of bonds, exist\nnot in the Real; the partless, changeless, peaceful; the unassailable,\nstainless; for what building-up could there be in the secondless, supreme\nreality, any more than in clear space?\n\nThere is no limiting, nor letting go, no binding nor gaining of success; there\nis neither the seeker of Freedom, nor the free; this, verily, is the ultimate\ntruth.\n\n### BENEDICTION\n\n(Verses 575--580)\n\nThis secret of secrets supreme, the perfect attainment, the perfection of the\nSelf, has been shown to thee by me today; making thee as my new-born child,\nfreed from the sin of the iron age, all thought of desire gone, making towards\nFreedom.\n\nThus hearing the teacher's words and paying him due reverence, he went forth,\nfree from his bondage, with the Master's consent.\n\nAnd he, the Teacher, his mind bathed in the happy streams of Being, went forth\nto make the whole world clean, incessantly.\n\nThus, by this Discourse of Teacher and Pupil, the\n\np. 90\n\ncharacter of the Self is taught to those seeking Freedom, that they may be\nborn to the joy of awakening.\n\nTherefore let all those who put away and cast aside every sin of thought, who\nare sated with this world's joys, whose thoughts are full of peace, who\ndelight in words of wisdom, who rule themselves, who long to be free, draw\nnear to this teaching, which is dedicated to them.\n\nTo those who, on the road of birth and death, are sore stricken by the heat\nthat the rays of the sun of pain pour down; who wander through this desert-\nworld, in weariness and longing for water; this well-spring of wisdom, close\nat hand, is pointed out, to bring them joy--the secondless Eternal. This\nTeaching of \xc5\x9aankara's bringing Liberation, wins the victory for them.\n\nThus is ended THE CREST-JEWEL OF WISDOM, made by the ever-blessed \xc5\x9aANKARA,\npupil at the holy feet of GOVINDA his Teacher, the supreme Swan, the Wanderer\nof the World.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Heritage of the Brahmans](cjw15.htm)\n\n"
