Now, when he who is about to perform an animal sacrifice makes a\nstake one cubit long, he thereby gains this (terrestrial) world; and when (he\nmakes) one two cubits long, he thereby gains the air-world; and when be makes\none three cubits long, he thereby gains the heavens; and when he makes one\nfour cubits long, he thereby gains the regions. But, indeed, that sacrificial\nstake of the (ordinary) animal sacrifice is either three or four cubits long,\nand one that is above that belongs to the Soma-sacrifice.\n\n11:7:4:22\\. As to this they say, 'Should he offer the butter-portions or\nnot?'--'Let him offer them,' they say; 'for the two butter-portions are the\neyes of the sacrifice, and what were man without eyes?' For as long as a co-\nsharer is not bought off by (receiving) a share of his own, so long does he\nconsider himself not bought off; but when he is bought off by a share of his\nown, then, indeed, he considers himself bought\n\np. 125\n\noff: when the Hot _ri_ , on that occasion 1, recites, 'Endow the Rakshas with\nblood!' he buys him off by (assigning to him) a share of his own.\n\n11:7:4:33\\. For on that occasion 2 the anguish of the victim, in being\nslaughtered, becomes concentrated in the heart, and from the heart (it flows)\ninto the spit. Thus, if they (were to) cook the animal together with the\nheart, the anguish would again spread all over the animal: let him therefore\ncook it (the heart) after spitting it from the side on a stick.\n\n11:7:4:44\\. He makes an underlayer of ghee (in the offering-ladle): this he\nmakes a type of the earth; he then puts a chip of gold thereon: this he makes\na type of fire; he then puts the omentum thereon: this he makes a type of the\nair; he then puts a chip of gold thereon: this he makes a type of the sun; and\nwhat (ghee) he pours upon it, that he makes a type of the heavens. This, then,\nis that five-portioned omentum,--fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the\nsacrificial animal, and five seasons there are in the year: this is why the\nomentum consists of five portions 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[125:1](sbe44040.htm#fr_387) Viz. at the time when the victim is cut up. Cf.\nAit. Br. II, 7,--'Endow ye the Rakshas with blood!' he says; for by (assigning\nto them) the husks and the sweepings of the grain the gods deprived the\nRakshas of their share in the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, and by the blood (they\ndeprived them) of that in the great (Soma-) sacrifice: thus by saying, 'Endow\nye the Rakshas with blood!' he dispossesses the Rakshas of the sacrifice by\nassigning to them their own share.--The Adhvaryu then smears a stalk of grass\nwith the blood with, 'Thou art the Rakshas' share,' throws it on the heap of\nrubbish, and treads on it with, 'Herewith I tread down the Rakshas,' &c.
