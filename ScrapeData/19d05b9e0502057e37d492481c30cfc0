The Agni Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n8\\. Agni Puran\xcc\x81a. "That Puran\xcc\x81a which describes the occurrences of the \xc3\x8d\xc5\x9bana\nKalpa, and was related by Agni to Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, is called the \xc3\x81gneya: it\nconsists of sixteen thousand stanzas 58." The Agni or Agneya Puran\xcc\x81a derives\nits name from its having being communicated originally by Agni, the deity of\nfire, to the Muni Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, for the purpose of instructing him in the\ntwofold knowledge of Brahma 59. By him it was taught to Vyasa, who imparted it\nto Suta; and the latter is represented as repeating it to the Rising at\nNaimisharan\xcc\x81ya. Its contents are variously specified as sixteen thousand,\nfifteen thousand, or fourteen thousand\n\np. xxxvii\n\nstanzas. The two copies which were employed by me contain about fifteen\nthousand \xc5\x9blokas. There are two in the Company\'s library, which do not extend\nbeyond twelve thousand verses; but they are in many other respects different\nfrom mine: one of them was written at Agra, in the reign of Akbar, in A. D.\n1589.\n\nThe Agni Puran\xcc\x81a, in the form in which it has been obtained in Bengal and at\nBenares, presents a striking contrast to the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya. It may be doubted\nif a single line of it is original. A very great proportion of it may be\ntraced to other sources; and a more careful collation --if the task was worth\nthe time it would require--would probably discover the remainder.\n\nThe early chapters of this Puran\xcc\x81a 60 describe the Avataras; and in those of\nRama and Krishn\xcc\x81a avowedly follow the Ramayan\xcc\x81a and Mahabharata. A\nconsiderable portion is then appropriated to instructions for the performance\nof religious ceremonies; many of winch belong to the Tantrika ritual, and are\napparently transcribed from the principal authorities of that system. Some\nbelong to mystical forms of \xc5\x9aaiva worship, little known in Hindustan, though\nperhaps still practised in the south. One of these is the Diksha, or\ninitiation of a novice; by which, with numerous ceremonies and invocations, in\nwhich the mysterious monosyllables of the Tantras are constantly repeated, the\ndisciple is transformed into a living personation of \xc5\x9aiva, and receives in\nthat capacity the homage of his Guru. Interspersed with these, are chapters\ndescriptive of the earth and of the universe, which are the same as those of\nthe Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a; and Mahatmyas or legends of holy places, particularly of\nGaya. Chapters on the duties of kings, and on the art of war, then occur,\nwhich have the appearance of being extracted from some older work, as is\nundoubtedly the chapter on judicature, which follows them, and which is the\nsame as the text of the Mitakshara. Subsequent to these, we have an account of\nthe distribution and arrangement of the Vedas and Puran\xcc\x81as, which is little\nelse than an abridgment of the\n\np. xxxviii\n\n[paragraph continues] Vishn\xcc\x81u: and in a chapter on gifts we have a description\nof the Puran\xcc\x81as, which is precisely the same, and in the same situation, as\nthe similar subject in the Matsya Puran\xcc\x81a. The genealogical chapters are\nmeagre lists, differing in a few respects from those commonly received, as\nhereafter noticed, but unaccompanied by any particulars, such as those\nrecorded or invented in the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya. The next subject is medicine,\ncompiled avowedly, but injudiciously, from the Sau\xc5\x9bruta. A series of chapters\non the mystic worship of \xc5\x9aiva and Devi follows; and the work winds up with\ntreatises on rhetoric, prosody, and grammar, according to the Sutras of\nPingala and Panini.\n\nThe cyclopaedical character of the Agni Puran\xcc\x81a, as it is now described,\nexcludes it from any legitimate claims to be regarded as a Puran\xcc\x81a, and proves\nthat its origin cannot be very remote. It is subsequent to the Itihasas; to\nthe chief works on grammar, rhetoric, and medicine; and to the introduction of\nthe Tantrika worship of Devi. When this latter took place is yet far from\ndetermined, but there is every probability that it dates long after the\nbeginning of our era. The materials of the Agni, Puran\xcc\x81a are, however, no\ndoubt of some antiquity. The medicine of Su\xc5\x9bruta is considerably older than\nthe ninth century; and the grammar of Panini probably precedes Christianity.\nThe chapters on archery and arms, and on regal administration, are also\ndistinguished by an entirely Hindu character, and must have been written long\nanterior to the Mohammedan invasion. So far the Agni Puran\xcc\x81a is valuable, as\nembodying and preserving relics of antiquity, although compiled at a more\'\nrecent date.\n\nCol. Wilford 61 has made great use of a list of kings derived from an appendix\nto the Agni Puran\xcc\x81a, which professes to be the sixty-third or last section. As\nhe observes, it is seldom found annexed to the Puran\xcc\x81a. I have never met with\nit, and doubt its ever having formed any part of the original compilation. It\nwould appear from Col. Wilford\'s remarks, that this list notices Mohammed as\nthe institutor of an era; but his account of this is not very distinct. He\nmentions explicitly, however, that the list speaks of Salivahana and\nVikramaditya; and this is quite\n\np. xxxix\n\nsufficient to establish its character. The compilers of the Puran\xcc\x81as were not\nsuch bunglers as to bring within their chronology so well known a personage as\nVikramaditya. There are in all parts of India various compilations ascribed to\nthe Puran\xcc\x81as, which never formed any portion of their contents, and which,\nalthough offering sometimes useful local information, and valuable as\npreserving popular traditions, are not in justice to be confounded with the\nPuran\xcc\x81as, so as to cause them to be charged with even more serious errors and\nanachronisms than those of which they are guilty.\n\nThe two copies of this work in the library of the East India Company\nappropriate the first half to a description of the ordinary and occasional\nobservances of the Hindus, interspersed with a few legends: the latter half\ntreats exclusively of the history of Mina.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xxxvi:58](vp012.htm#fr_57) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_03600.jpg)\n\n[xxxvi:59](vp012.htm#fr_58) See .\n\n[xxxvii:60](vp012.htm#fr_59) Analysis of the Agni Puran\xcc\x81a: Journal of the\nAsiatic Society of Bengal, March 1832.
