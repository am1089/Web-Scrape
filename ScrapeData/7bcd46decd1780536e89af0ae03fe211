Verily, from this sacrifice the man 5 is born\n\np. 260\n\nand whatever food a man consumes in this world, that (food), in return,\nconsumes him in yonder world. Now this sacrifice is performed by means of\nspirituous liquor, and spirituous liquor (parisrut) is not to be consumed by a\nBrahma _n_ a: he thus is born from that which is not (to be) consumed, and the\nfood does not, in return, consume him in yonder world. Therefore this\n(sacrifice), the Sautrama _n_ i, is a Brahma _n_ a's sacrifice 1.\n\n12:9:1:22\\. The malted rice is the same as his (the man's) hair, the malted\nbarley his skin, the fried rice his flesh, the filtering-cloth his bones, the\nmash his marrow, the raw liquor (parisrut) his life-sap (serum), the seasoning\n(and fermentative substances) his blood, the milk his seed, the mature liquor\n(sura) his urine, and the impure matter the contents of the stomach.\n\n12:9:1:33\\. Indra's cake is his heart, that of Savit _ri_ his liver, that of\nVaru _n_ a his lung, the a _s_ vattha and udumbara vessels his kidneys, the\nnyagrodha one his bile, the pan (sthali) his intestines 2, the supernumerary\n(vessels) his bowels 2, the two eagle feathers 3 the milt, the throne-seat his\nnavel, the pot his rectum, the (pan) perforated with a hundred holes, the male\norgan,--and inasmuch as that (pan) is much perforated, therefore that organ is\nmuch divided,--the bowl (sata) is his mouth, the strainer\n\np. 261\n\nhis tongue, the dish ( _k_ apya) his anus, the tail (whisk) his bladder,\n\n12:9:1:44\\. And the sacrificial animal of the A _s_ vins is his limbs, that of\nSarasvati his trunk, Indra's bull his form,--whence they say that man's form\n(wealth) is kine,--the gold (plate) is his vital strength; it is of the weight\nof a hundred (grains), whence mark has a life of a hundred (years).\n\n12:9:1:55\\. The two cups of the A _s_ vins are his eyes, and the ground wheat\nand kuvala (jujubes) his eyelashes; the two cups of Sarasvati are his\nnostrils, and the ground Indra-grain and badara (jujubes) the hair in his\nnostrils; the two cups of Indra are his ears, and the ground barley and\nkarkandhu (jujubes) the hair of his ears and his eyebrows.\n\n12:9:1:66\\. And the hairs of wolf are the hair on his abdomen and that below;\nand the hairs of tiger are the hair on his chest and that of his armpits; and\nthe hairs of lion are the hair of his head and his beard.\n\n12:9:1:77\\. There are three sacrificial animals, for this body of man consists\nof three parts: it is the body he thereby wins (in heaven) for him;--what is\nbelow the navel (he wins) by that of the A _s_ vins, what is above the navel\nand below the head by that of Sarasvati, and the head itself by that of Indra:\nboth as to its (bodily) form and as to its deities he thus delivers his own\nself from death, and makes it immortal.\n\n12:9:1:88\\. There are three sacrificial cakes, for this life of man consists\nof three parts: it is life he thereby wins for him;--the early life (he wins)\nby that of Indra, the middle (part of) life by that of Savit _ri_ , and the\nlast (part of) life by that of Varu _n_ a: both as to its (bodily) form and as\nto its deities he thus delivers his life from death, and makes it immortal.\n\np. 262\n\n12:9:1:99\\. There are six cups (of milk and liquor), for there are these six\n(channels of) vital airs in the head: it is the vital airs he thereby wins for\nhim;--his eyes (he wins) by the two (cups) of the A _s_ vins, his nostrils by\nthose of Sarasvati, and his ears by those of Indra: both as to its (bodily)\nform and as to its deities he thus delivers his own self from death, and makes\nit immortal.\n\n12:9:1:1010\\. The invitatory and offering-formulas are made continuous 1, and\nrelate to the same deities--for the continuity and uninterruptedness of the\nvital airs. They are all of them invitatory formulas and all offering-\nformulas, whence all the vital airs pass onwards and all of them backwards.\nAll (the formulas) are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last,\nwhence all the vital airs are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them\nlast. All the cups have two (formulas, an) invitatory and (an) offering-\nformula,--this is of the form of the in (and out)-breathing and the up-\nbreathing: it is the in-breathing and the up-breathing he thus secures for\nhimself, and therefore all the vital airs are established on the in-breathing\nand the up-breathing.\n\n12:9:1:1111\\. Verily the Sautrama _n_ i is this body (of man): the Sacrificer\nis the mind, (that is) speech manifestly; the vedi (altar-ground) is the\ntrunk, the uttara-vedi (high-altar) offspring, the barhis (grass-covering)\ncattle, the officiating priests the limbs, the fuel the hones, the ghee the\nmarrow, the fire the mouth, the oblation is food, and the concluding rite is\nlife, whence he who has performed the Sautrama _n_ i attains life.\n\np. 263\n\n12:9:1:1212\\. And, verily, these two men that seem to be in the eyes, they\nbelong to the A _s_ vins, and the black (in the eye) belongs to Sarasvati, and\nthe white to Indra; and in that, when the victim of the A _s_ vins is being\n(offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those\n(parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.\n\n12:9:1:1313\\. Indra, assuredly, is the mind, Sarasvati speech, and the two A\n_s_ vins are the ears. Now, whatever one thinks in his mind of that he speaks\nwith his speech, and what he speaks with his speech that one hears with one's\nears: thus, in that, when the victim of Sarasvati is being (offered), he makes\noffering to these deities together, thereby he puts these (parts of the body)\ntogether and takes them to himself.\n\n12:9:1:1414\\. Indra, assuredly, is the breath, Sarasvati the tongue, and the\ntwo A _s_ vins the nostrils; and inasmuch as through (the channel of) the\nbreath (pra _n_ a) one introduces (pra- _n_ i) food into himself that is the\nreason of its being (called) 'pra _n_ a.' By means of the tongue one\ndistinguishes the essence (taste) of food, and the nostrils, indeed, are the\npath of the breath; and in that, when the victim of Indra. is being (offered),\nhe makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of\nthe body) together and takes them to himself.\n\n12:9:1:1515\\. Indra, assuredly, is the heart, Savit _ri_ the liver, and Varu\n_n_ a the lung; and in that, when Indra's cake is being (offered), he makes\noffering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of the body)\ntogether and takes them to himself.\n\n12:9:1:1616\\. Savit _ri_ , assuredly, is the breath, Varu _n_ a the\n\np. 264\n\nthrough-breathing, and Indra the generative organ; and whatever food one eats\nby means of (the channel of) the breath through that he breathes with his\nthrough-breathing, and by means of the generative organ he sheds the essence\nof food as seed; and in that, when Savit _ri_ 's cake is being (offered), he\nmakes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of the\nbody) together and takes them to himself.\n\n12:9:1:1717\\. Varu _n_ a, assuredly, is the womb, Indra the seed, and Savit\n_ri_ the generator of the seed; and in that, when Varu _n_ a's cake is being\n(offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those\n(parts of the body) together and takes them to himself. And whosoever thus\nknows this comes into being along with these deities, and is born again (so as\nto be) along with these deities; he increases in offspring and cattle; he\nbecomes firmly established in this world, and wins the heavenly world,\nwhosoever, knowing this, performs the Sautrama _n_ i, or whosoever thus knows\nthis.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[259:5](sbe44071.htm#fr_658) That is, the Purusha, Agni-Pra _g_ apati; and the\nSacrificer.\n\n[260:1](sbe44071.htm#fr_659) That is, because to a man of another caste the\nspirituous liquor would not be 'anadya,' but consumable, and hence it would\nconsume him in the other world.\n\n[260:2](sbe44071.htm#fr_661) The two terms 'antra _n_ i' and guda _h_ ' are\nusually taken as synonymous; the latter term probably means the lower or\nlarger intestines; cf.
