And (the case of the term avyakta) is like that of the term mahat.\n\nWhile the Sa _n_ khyas employ the term 'the Great one,' to denote the first-\nborn entity, which is mere existence  1(? viz. the intellect), the term has a\ndifferent meaning in Vedic use. This we see from its being connected with the\nSelf, &c. in such passages as the following, 'The great Self is beyond the\nIntellect' (Ka. Up. I, 3, 10); 'The great omnipresent Self (Ka. Up. I, 2, 23);\n'I know that great person' ( _S_ ve. Up. III, 8). We thence conclude that the\nword avyakta also, where it occurs in the Veda, cannot denote the pradhana.--\nThe pradhana is therefore a mere thing of inference, and not vouched for by\nScripture.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[252:1](sbe34118.htm#fr_236) The commentators give different explanations of\nthe Sattamatra of the text.--Sattamatre sattvapradhanaprak _ri_ ter adyapari\n_n_ ame.
