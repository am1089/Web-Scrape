What has been defiled by the impure excretions of the body, by spirits, or\nby intoxicating drinks, is impure in the highest degree.\n\n[XXIII. 2. \xc3\x82past. I. 5, 17, 10; Gaut. I, 29.--4. Y. I. 185; Gaut. I. 29, 31.--\n5. M. V, 123; Gaut. I, 34-7-11. M. V, 111, 112, 116, 117; Y. I, 182, 183.--7,\n8. Gaut. I, 29, 30.--13-{footnote p. 98} 15. M. V, 118, 119; Y. I, 184, 182.--\n16. M.

All vessels made of iron (or of other metals or of composition metals such\nas bell-metal and the like), which are impure in the highest degree, become\npure by exposure to the fire.\n\n3\\. Things made of gems or stones or water-shells, (such as conch-shells or\nmother-of-pearl, become pure) by digging them into the earth for seven days.\n\n4\\. Things made of horns (of rhinoceroses or other animals), or of teeth (of\nelephants or other animals), or of bone (of tortoises or other animals, become\npure) by planing them.\n\n5\\. Vessels made of wood or earthenware must be thrown away.\n\n6\\. Of a garment, which has been defiled in the highest degree, let him cut\noff that part which, having been washed, is changed in colour.\n\n7\\. Objects made of gold, silver, water-shells, or gems, when (they are only\ndefiled by leavings of food, and the like, and) not smeared (with greasy\nsubstances), are cleansed with water.\n\n8\\. So are stone cups and vessels used at Soma-sacrifices (when not smeared).\n\n[7. The defilement in the highest degree having been treated of in the six\npreceding Sutras, he now goes on to discuss the various cases of lesser\ndefilement. (Nand.)\n\n8-11. Regarding the shape of the sacrificial implements mentioned {footnote p.\n99} in these Sutras, see the plates in Professor Max Muller's paper, 'Die\nTodtenbestattung bei den Brahmanen,' in the journal of the German Oriental\nSociety, IX, LXXVIII-LXXX.]\n\np. 99\n\n9\\. Sacrificial pots, ordinary wooden ladles, and wooden ladles with two\ncollateral excavations (used for pouring clarified butter on a sacrificial\nfire) are cleansed with hot water (when not smeared).\n\n10\\. Vessels used for oblations (of butter, fruits, and the like are cleansed)\nby rubbing them with the hand (with blades of Ku _s_ a grass) at the time of\nthe sacrifice.\n\n11\\. Sword-shaped pieces of wood for stirring the boiled rice, winnowing\nbaskets, implements used for preparing grain, pestles and mortars (are\ncleansed) by sprinkling water over them.\n\n12\\. So are beds, vehicles, and seats (when defiled even by the touch of a _S_\nudra)[1].\n\n13\\. Likewise, a large quantity (of anything).\n\n14\\. Grain, skins (of antelopes, &c.), ropes, woven cloth, (fans and the like)\nmade of bamboo, thread, cotton, and clothes (which have only just come from\nthe manufactory, or which are dyed with saffron and will not admit of washing\nfor that reason, are cleansed in the same way, when there is a large quantity\nof them);\n\n15\\. Also, pot-herbs, roots, fruits, and flowers;\n\n16\\. Likewise, grass, firewood, dry cow-dung (used as fuel), and leaves (of\nthe Madhuka, Pala _s_ a, or other trees).\n\n[12. 1 This Sutra and the following ones relate to defilement caused by touch.\n(Nand.)\n\n13\\. 'I. e. more than one man can carry, as Baudhayana says.' (Nand.)\n\n14\\. The use of the particle _k_ a implies that resin and other objects\nmentioned by Devala must be included in this enumeration. (Nand.)]\n\np. 100\n\n17\\. The same (when smeared with excrements and the like, are cleansed) by\nwashing\n\n18\\. And so (have the objects mentioned in Sutra 14, if defiled without being\nsmeared, to be cleansed by washing), when there is only a small quantity of\nthem;\n\n19\\. Silk and wool, with saline earths;\n\n20\\. (Blankets or plaids) made of the hair of the mountain-goat, with the\nfruits of the soap plant;\n\n21\\. Clothes made of the bark of trees[1], with Bel fruit;\n\n22\\. Linen cloth, with white sesamum;\n\n23\\. Likewise, things made of horns, bone, or teeth;\n\n24\\. (Rugs or covers) made of deer's hair, with lotus-seeds;\n\n25\\. Vessels of copper, bell-metal, tin, and lead, with acidulated water;\n\n26\\. Vessels of white copper and iron, with ashes;\n\n27\\. Wooden articles, by planing;\n\n28\\. Vessels made of fruits (such as cocoa-nuts, bottle-gourds, and Be]\nfruits), by (rubbing them with) cows' hair.\n\n29\\. Many things in a heap, by sprinkling water over them;\n\n30\\. Liquids (such as clarified butter, milk, &c.), by straining them;\n\n[17. 'All the objects mentioned in Sutras 12-16 must be washed, but so as to\navoid injuring them, in case they have been defiled by excrements or other\nsuch impure substances.' (Nand.)\n\n21\\. The term a _ms_ upa _tt_ a has been rendered in accordance with Nand.'s\ninterpretation, which agrees with Vi _g_ \xc3\xb1ane _s_ vara's (on Y. I, 186).\nKulluka (on M. V, 120; see the Petersburg Dictionary) appears to refer it to\ntwo different sorts of clothes.\n\n30-37. These Sutras relate to defilement caused by insects, &c. (Nand.)]\n\np. 101\n\n31\\. Lumps of sugar and other preparations from the sugar-cane[1], stored up\nin large quantities (exceeding a Dro _n_ a) and kept in one's own house[2], by\nwater and fire[3];\n\n32\\. All sorts of salt, in the same manner;\n\n33\\. Earthern vessels (if smeared with excrements and the like), by a second\nburning;\n\n34\\. Images of gods (if smeared), by cleansing them in the same way as the\nmaterial (of which they are made is generally cleansed), and then installing\nthem anew (in their former place).\n\n35\\. Of undressed grain let him remove so much only as has been defiled, and\nthe remainder let him pound in a mortar and wash.\n\n36\\. A quantity of prepared grain not exceeding a Dro _n_ a is not spoiled by\nbeing defiled (by dogs, crows, and other unclean animals).\n\n37\\. He must throw away thus much of it only as has been defiled, and must\nsprinkle over the remainder water, into which a piece of gold has been\ndropped, and over which the Gayatri has been pronounced, and must hold it tip\nbefore a goat (or before a horse) and before the fire.\n\n[31. 1 Such as raw sugar, candied sugar, &c.--2 If there is no large quantity\nof them, they require to be sprinkled with water only; and if they are kept\nelsewhere than in the house, as if they are exposed for sale in a fair, they\nrequire no purification at all.--3 They must be encircled with fire, and\nsprinkled with water afterwards. (Nand.)\n\n32\\. Nand. mentions as the main species of salt, rock-salt, sea-salt, sochal-\nsalt, and _S_ ambhala-salt. The last term refers perhaps to salt coming from\nthe famous salt-lake of Sakambhari or Shambar in Ra _g_ putana.\n\n37\\. 'A quantity less than a Dro _n_ a having been defiled must be thrown\naway, as stated by Para _s_ ara.' (Nand.) One Dro _n_ a = 4 \xc3\x82 _dh_ akas = 1024\nMush _t_ is or handfuls. The meaning of \xc3\x82 _dh_ aka, {footnote p. 102} however,\naccording to Nand.'s observation, varies in different countries. See\nColebrooke's Essays, 1, 533 seq.]\n\np. 102\n\n38\\. That (food) which has been nibbled by a bird (except a crow or other such\nbirds that must not be eaten or touched), smelt at by a cow, sneezed on, or\ndefiled by (human) hair, or by insects or worms, is purified by earth\nscattered over it.\n\n39\\. As long as the scent or moisture, caused by any unclean substance,\nremains on the defiled object, so long must earth and water be constantly\napplied in all purifications of inanimate objects.\n\n40\\. A goat and a horse are pure, as regards their mouths, but not a cow, nor\nthe impure excretions of a man's body; roads are purified by the rays of the\nmoon and of the sun, and by the winds.\n\n41\\. Mire and water upon the high road, that has been touched by low-caste\npeople, by dogs, or by crows, as well as buildings constructed with burnt\nbricks, are purified by the wind.\n\n42\\. For everybody let him (the \xc3\x82 _k_ arya or spiritual guide) carefully\ndirect the performance of purificatory ceremonies, with earth and water, when\nhe has been defiled in the highest degree.\n\n43\\. Stagnant water, even if a single cow only has quenched her thirst with\nit, is pure, unless it is quite filled with (hair or other) unclean objects;\nit is the same with water upon a rock (or upon the top of a mountain).\n\n44\\. From a well, in which a five-toed animal (whether man or beast, but not\none of the five-toed\n\n[38. in explanation of the term amedhya, 'unclean substance,' Nand. quotes the\nfollowing passage of Devala, 'Human bones, a corpse, excrements, semen, urine,\nthe menstrual discharge, adeps, sweat, the rheum of the eyes, phlegm, and\nspirituous liquors are called unclean substances.']\n\np. 103\n\nanimals whose flesh may be eaten), has died, or which has been defiled in the\nhighest degree, he must take out all the waters and dry up the remainder with\na cloth.\n\n45\\. If it is a well constructed with burnt bricks (or stones,) he must light\na fire and afterwards throw Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ agavya into it, when fresh water is coming\nforth.\n\n46\\. For small reservoirs of water and for ponds the same mode of purification\nhas been prescribed as for wells, O Earth; but large tanks (excepting Tirthas)\nare not defiled (by dead animals, &c.)\n\n47\\. The gods have declared, as peculiar to Brahma _n_ as, three causes\neffecting purity: if an (existing) impurity has not been perceived by them; if\nthey, sprinkle the object (supposed to be impure) with water; and if they\ncommend it, in doubtful cases, with their speech, (saying, 'This or that shall\nbe pure.')\n\n48\\. The hand of a (cook or other) artizan, things exposed for sale in a shop\n(though they may, have passed through the hands of many customers), food given\nto a Brahma _n_ a (by other Brahma _n_ as, or by, Kshatriyas, &c., but not by\n_S_ udras), and all manufactories or mines (of sugar, salt, and the like, but\nnot distilleries of spirituous liquor), are always pure.\n\n49\\. The mouth of a woman is always pure (for the purpose of a kiss); a bird\nis pure on the fall of fruit (which he has pecked); a sucking calf (or child),\non the flowing of the milk; a dog, on his catching the deer.\n\n50\\. Flesh of an animal which has been killed by dogs is pronounced pure; and\nso is that of an\n\n[44. 1 See LI, 6.]\n\np. 104\n\nanimal slain by other carnivorous creatures (such as tigers) or by huntsmen\nsuch as Ka _nd_ alas (Svapa _k_ as, Kshatt _ri_ s, or other low-caste men).\n\n51\\. The cavities above the navel must be considered as pure; those below it\nare impure; and so are all excretions that fall from the body.\n\n52\\. Flies, saliva dropping from the mouth, a shadow, a cow, an elephant, a\nhorse, sun-beams, dust, the earth, air, fire, and a cat are always pure.\n\n53\\. Such drops as fall from the mouth of a man upon any part of his body do\nnot render it impure, nor do hairs of the beard that enter his mouth, nor\nremnants of his food adhering to his teeth.\n\n54\\. Drops which trickle on the feet of a man holding water for others to sip\nit, are considered as equal to waters springing from the earth: by them he is\nnot soiled.\n\n55\\. He who is anyhow touched by anything impure, while holding things in his\nhands, is purified by sipping water, without laying the things on the ground.\n\n[51. There are, according to Indian views, nine cavities or apertures of the\nbody: the mouth, the two ears, the two nostrils, the two eyes, and the organs\nof excretion and generation. The two last are impure, the rest are pure.\n\n55\\. Nand. and Kulluka (on M. V, 143) explain that hasta, 'hand,' here means\n'arm,' as it would be impossible to sip water without using the hand. The\nformer adds that, if the things are being carried with the hand, they must be\nplaced in the cavity formed by the fore-arm. He refutes the opinion of the\n'Eastern Commentators,' who, arguing from another Smriti, contend that the\nthings have to be placed on the ground and to be sprinkled with water; and he\nfurther tries to account for the seemingly contradictory rules propounded by\nVasish _th_ a (Benares ed., III, 43) and Gautama (I, 28) by explaining that a\nlarge quantity of things should be laid on the ground, and a small quantity\nplaced upon {footnote p. 105} some other limb, and further, that food should\nalways be placed on the ground, but that a garment, a stick, and the like\nshould be kept in the hand. Compare Dr. Buhler's note on Gaut. loc. cit. It\nmay be remarked, incidentally, that Nand. quotes the reading u _kkh_ ish _t_ o\n'nidhaya in the passage of Gautama referred to.]\n\np. 105\n\n56\\. A house is purified by scouring it with a broom and plastering the ground\nwith cow-dung, and a manuscript or book by sprinkling water over it. Land is\ncleansed by scouring, by plastering it with cow-dung,\n\n57\\. By sprinkling[1], by scraping, by burning, or by letting cows (or goats)\npass (a day and a night) on it. Cows are auspicious purifiers, upon cows\ndepend the worlds,\n\n58\\. Cows alone make sacrificial oblations possible (by producing sacrificial\nbutter), cows take away every sin. The urine of cows, their dung, clarified\nbutter, milk, sour milk, and Goro _k_ ana:\n\n59\\. Those six excellent (productions) of a cow are always propitious. Drops\nof water falling from the horns of a cow are productive of religious merit,\nand have the power to expiate all sins (of those who bathe in, or rub\nthemselves with, them).\n\n60\\. Scratching the back of a cow destroys all guilt, and giving her to eat\nprocures exaltation in heaven.\n\n[56, 'The term pustaka refers to MSS. or books, whether made of palm leaves,\nor of prepared hemp, or of prepared reeds ( _s_ ara).' (Nand.) It may be that\nNand. means by the last term a sort of paper, though paper is usually called\nby its Arabian name (kagad) in Indian works. See regarding the materials used\nfor writing in ancient India, Burnell's Palaeography, p. 84 seq. (2nd ed.)\n\n57\\. 1 The term seka, 'sprinkling,' either refers to the earth being sprinkled\nby rain, or to Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ agavya being poured over it. (Nand.)\n\n58\\. Goro _k_ ana is a bright yellow pigment which is said to be prepared from\nthe urine or bile of a cow.]\n\np. 106\n\n61\\. In the urine of cows dwells the Ganges, prosperity (dwells) in the dust\n(rising from their couch), good fortune in cow-dung, and virtue in saluting\nthem. Therefore should they be constantly saluted.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXIV.](sbe07026.htm)\n\n"
