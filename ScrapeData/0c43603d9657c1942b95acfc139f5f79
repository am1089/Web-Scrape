LEGAL PROCEDURE.\n\n* 1. 1 When mortals were bent on doing their duty alone and habitually veracious, there existed neither lawsuits, nor hatred, nor selfishness.\n\n* 2. The practice of duty having died out among mankind, lawsuits have been introduced; and the king has been appointed to decide lawsuits, because he has authority to punish.\n\n3. 3 Documents and (the testimony of) witnesses are declared to be the two methods for clearing up doubtful matters, where two parties are quarrelling with one another.\n\n* 4. 4 Proceedings at law are of two kinds; attended by a wager, or not attended by a wager. A lawsuit\n\np. 6\n\nattended by a wager is where (either of the two parties) stakes in writing a\ncertain sum which has to be paid besides the sum in dispute (in case of\ndefeat).\n\n5. 5 In a lawsuit attended by a wager, he of the two who is cast must pay his stake and a fine when his defeat has been decided.\n\n* 6. 6 The plaint is declared to be the essential part of a proceeding-at-law. If he succumbs with it, the defendant loses the whole suit. If he can prove the charge, he gains the suit.\n\n* 7. 7 Gatherings (kula), corporations ( _s_ re _n_ i), assemblies (ga _n_ a), one appointed (by the king), and the king (himself), are invested with the power to decide\n\np. 7\n\nlawsuits; and of these, each succeeding one is superior to the one preceding\nhim in order.\n\n* 8. Judicial procedure has four feet, four bases, four means, it benefits four, reaches four, and produces four results. This has been declared.\n\n* 9. It has eight members, eighteen topics, a hundred branches, three efficient causes, two modes of plaint, two openings, and two issues.\n\n* 10. Virtue, a judicial proceeding, documentary evidence, and an edict from the king are the four feet of a lawsuit. Each following one is superior to the one previously named.\n\n* 11. 11 There virtue is based on truth; a judicial proceeding (rests) on the statements of the witnesses; documentary evidence (rests) on declarations reduced\n\np. 8\n\nto writing; an edict (depends) on the pleasure of the king.\n\n* 12. 12 Because the four means, of conciliation and the rest, are adopted, it is said to have four means. Because it protects the four orders, therefore it is said to benefit four.\n\n* 13. 13 Because it affects criminals, witnesses, the assessors of the court, and the king, to the amount of one quarter each, therefore it is said to reach four.\n\n* 14. Because it produces these four, justice, gain, renown, and esteem among men, therefore it is declared to produce four results.\n\n* 15. 15 Because it consists of these eight, the king,\n\np. 9\n\nhis dutiful officer, the assessors of the court, the law-book, the accountant\nand scribe, gold, fire, and water; therefore it is said to have eight members.\n\n* 16. 16 Recovery of a debt, deposits, partnership, resumption of gift, breach of a contract of service,\n\n* 17. Non-payment of wages, sales effected by another than the rightful owner, non-delivery of a sold chattel, rescission of purchase,\n\n* 18. Transgression of a compact, boundary disputes, the mutual duties of husband and wife, law of inheritance, heinous offences,\n\n* 19. Abuse, assault, games, and miscellaneous, these are (the eighteen titles of law) on account of which (judicial procedure) is said to have eighteen topics.\n\n* 20. 20 Their branches amount to one hundred and\n\np. 10\n\nthirty-two. On account of the multifariousness of human concerns, (a judicial\nproceeding) is said to have a hundred branches.\n\n21\\. 'Recovery of a debt' has twenty-five divisions; 'deposits' has six;\n'partnership' has three; 'resumption of gift' has four;\n\np. 11\n\n22\\. 'Breach of service' consists of nine divisions; 'wages' has four\ndivisions; there are two divisions of 'sales effected by another than the\nrightful owner;' 'non-delivery of a sold chattel' has a single division only;\n\n23\\. 'Rescission of purchase' has four divisions; 'transgression of compact'\nis onefold; 'boundary disputes' is twelvefold; there are twenty divisions in\n'mutual duties of husband and wife;'\n\np. 12\n\n24\\. 'Law of inheritance' consists of nineteen divisions; 'heinous offences'\nof twelve; of both 'abuse' and 'assault' there are three divisions;\n\n25\\. 'Gambling with dice and betting on animals' has a single division;\n'miscellaneous' has six divisions. Thus, adding up all these branches (of the\nprincipal titles of law), there are one hundred and thirty-two of them.\n\np. 13\n\n* 26. Because it proceeds from one of these three motives, carnal desire, wrath, and greed; therefore it is said to have three efficient causes. These are the three sources of lawsuits.\n\n* 27. 27 It is said to have two modes of plaint, because a plaint may be either founded on suspicion or on fact. It is founded on suspicion, when the defendant has been seen to move in bad company. It is founded on fact, when the stolen chattels or the like have come to light.\n\n* 28. Because it is based on the statements of the two litigants, therefore it is said to have two openings. There the accusation is called the plaint; the answer is called the declaration of the defendant.\n\n* 29. 29 Because it may be founded either on truth or on error, therefore it is said to have two issues. Truth is what rests on true facts. Error is what rests on mistake of facts.\n\n30\\. Ordeals even are rendered nugatory by artful men. Therefore let no\nmistake be committed in regard to place, time, quantity, and so on.\n\np. 14\n\n31. 31 There a king who acts justly must neglect error when it is brought forward, and seek truth alone, because prosperity depends on (the practice of) duty.\n\n32. 32 As seven flames rise from fire, even so will seven good things become manifest in a self-restrained king who passes just sentences at trials.\n\n33\\. Religious merit, gain, fame, esteem among men, reverence on the part of\nhis subjects, conquests, and an everlasting residence in paradise.\n\n34. 34 Therefore let a king, after having seated himself on the judgment seat, be equitable towards all beings, discarding selfish interests and acting the part of (Yama) Vaivasvata, (the judge of the dead).\n\n* 35. 35 Attending to (the dictates of) the law-book and adhering to the opinion of his chief judge, let him try causes in due order, adhibiting great care.\n\n36. 36 The connection (agama) must be examined\n\np. 15\n\nfirst of all; then the title of law must be ascertained; thereupon follows the\ncure; and the decision comes at the end. These are the four parts of a trial.\n\n37\\. Avoiding carefully the violation of either the sacred law or the dictates\nof prudence, he should conduct the trial attentively and skilfully.\n\n38. 38 As a huntsman traces the vestiges of wounded deer in a thicket by the drops of blood, even so let him trace justice.\n\n* 39. 39 Where the rules of sacred law and the dictates of prudence are at variance, he must discard the dictates of prudence and follow the rules of sacred law.\n\n40. 40 When it is impossible to act up to the precepts of sacred law, it becomes necessary tot, adopt a method founded on reasoning, because custom decides everything and overrules the sacred law.\n\n41. 41 Divine law has a subtile nature, and is occult\n\np. 16\n\nand difficult to understand. Therefore (the king) must try causes according to\nthe visible path.\n\n* 42. 42 One who has never committed robbery may be charged with robbery. An actual robber, on the other hand, may be acquitted of the charge of robbery. Ma _n_ _d_ avya was tried and declared to be a robber.\n\n* 43. 43 In the case of a woman, at night, outside of\n\np. 17\n\nthe village, in the interior of a house, and by enemies; a sentence passed\nunder any one of these various circumstances may be reversed.\n\n* 44. 44 Owing to the recondite nature of lawsuits, and the weakness of memory, the answer may be delayed at pleasure in lawsuits relating to a debt or other subject, with a view to ascertain the true facts.\n\n* 45. 45 Let him answer at once in charges concerning a cow, landed property, gold, a woman, robbery, abuse, an urgent affair, a heinous offence, or a calumny.\n\n* 46. One who tries to right himself in a quarrel, without having given notice to the king, shall be severely punished and his cause must not be heard.\n\n* 47. A defendant who absconds when the cause is about to be tried, and he who does not take heed of what (the claimant) says, shall be arrested by the plaintiff until the legal summons has been declared.\n\n* 48. 48 Local arrest, temporary arrest, inhibition\n\np. 18\n\nfrom travelling, and arrest relating to karman; these are the four sorts of\narrest. One arrested must not break his arrest.\n\n* 49. 49 One arrested while crossing a river, or in a forest (kantara), or in a bad country, or during a great calamity, or in another such predicament, commits no fault by breaking his arrest.\n\n[50. 50 Those causes which have been tried in the king's court, (or) by\nfriends, connections, or relations, shall be tried anew, after a fine of twice\nthe original amount (of the sum in dispute) has been imposed.]\n\n* 51. 51 If one arrested at a proper time breaks his arrest, he shall be punished. One who arrests improperly is (equally) liable to punishment.\n\n* 52. 52 One about to marry; one tormented by an illness; one about to offer a sacrifice; one afflicted by a calamity; one accused by another; one employed in the king's service;\n\np. 19\n\n* 53. 53 Cowherds engaged in tending cattle; cultivators in the act of cultivation; artizans, while engaged in their own occupations; soldiers, during warfare;\n\n* 54. One who has not yet arrived at years of discretion; a messenger; one about to give alms; one fulfilling a vow; one harassed by difficulties: a person belonging to any of these categories must not be arrested, nor shall the king summon him (before a court of justice).\n\n* 55. 55 One accused of an offence must not lodge a plaint himself, unless he have refuted the charge raised by the other party. Neither (is he allowed to accuse) one who has already been accused by a different party. It is wrong to strike one again who has already been struck (by another).\n\n56. 56 When he has proffered a charge, he must not\n\np. 20\n\nagain alter it. He must not recede from his previous claim. By doing so he\nwill lose his suit.\n\n57\\. He must not lodge a false plaint. He is a sinner who proffers a false\ncharge (against any one). Whatever fine is declared in a suit of this sort has\nto be paid by the claimant.\n\n58. 58 If a man delays his answer under false pretences, or if he stands mute at the trial, or if he revokes his own former statements: these are the signs by which a loser of his cause may be known.\n\n59. 59 One who absconds after having received the summons, or who does not make any defence after having arrived in court, shall be punished by the king, because his cause is lost.\n\n60. 60 If a man being questioned does not uphold\n\np. 21\n\na statement duly made by himself (at a former stage of the trial); or if he\nends by admitting what had been previously negatived by himself;\n\n61. 61 Or if he is unable to produce any witnesses, after having declared that they are in existence and having been asked to produce them: by all such signs as these persons devoid of virtue may be known.\n\n* 62. 62 When a lawsuit has been decided evidence becomes useless, unless a document or witnesses can be produced who or which had not been announced at a former stage of the trial.\n\n* 63. As the (fertilizing) power of rain is thrown away on ripe grain, even so evidence becomes useless when the suit has been decided.\n\np. 22\n\n64. 64 False statements even have to be examined if they have been made in due season. That, on the other hand, which has been passed over in silence through inadvertency, fails to produce any result, even though it be true.\n\n* 65. 65 If a man is of opinion that the suit has been decided and punishment declared in a way contrary to justice, he may have the cause tried once more, provided he should pay twice the amount of the fine inflicted.\n\n* 66. 66 If a verdict contrary to justice has been passed, the assessors of the court must pay that fine; because nobody certainly can act as a judge without incurring the risk of being punished (eventually).\n\n67. 67 When a member of a court of justice, actuated by wrath, ignorance, or covetousness, has passed an\n\np. 23\n\nunjust sentence, he shall be declared unworthy to be a member of the court,\nand the king shall punish him for his offence.\n\n* 68. 68 That king, however, who is intent on doing his duty, must be particularly anxious to discover what is right and what is wrong, because there is a variety of dispositions among mankind.\n\n69\\. There are some who give false evidence from covetousness. There are other\nvillainous wretches who resort to forging documentary evidence.\n\n70\\. Therefore both (sorts of evidence) must be tested by the king with great\ncare: documents, according to the rules regarding writings; witnesses,\naccording to the law of witnesses.\n\n* 71. Liars may have the appearance of veracious men, and veracious men may resemble liars. There are many different characters. Therefore it is necessary to examine (everything).\n\n* 72. 72 The firmament has the appearance of a flat surface, and the fire-fly looks like fire. Yet there is no surface to the sky, nor fire in the fire-fly.\n\n* 73. Therefore it is proper to investigate a matter, even though it should have happened before one's own eyes. One who does not deliver his opinion till he has investigated the matter will not violate justice.\n\np. 24\n\n* 74. Thus a king, constantly trying lawsuits with attention, will acquire widespread and brilliant renown in this life and the abode of Indra after his death.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[5:1](sbe3305.htm#fr_24) I, 1. Where the sun shines, there is no shade. Where\nthere is shade, there the sun does not shine. Similarly, where virtue reigns,\nthere are neither lawsuits, nor hatred, nor selfishness. On the other hand,\nwhere these three are, there virtue is not to be found. A. The object of this\nintroductory portion is to show how far judicial procedure is connected with\nDharma 'Virtue,' or 'Duty,' the principal subject of an Indian law-book. The\nViramitrodaya and other compilations attribute a further hemistich to Narada,\nin which the happy age here alluded to is referred to the period 'when Manu,\nthe father of mankind, was reigning on earth.'\n\n[5:3](sbe3305.htm#fr_25) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 22; Vasish _th_ a XVI, 10;\nVish _n_ u VI, 23.\n\n[5:4](sbe3305.htm#fr_26) 'A lawsuit attended by a wager' is where one of the\nparties promises in writing to pay a certain sum to the king, over and above\nthe amount in dispute. 'A lawsuit not attended by a wager' is one devoid of a\nstipulation of this sort. Viramitrodaya. This is apparently the correct\nexplanation. Asahaya observes that the amount staked may be much smaller than\nthe amount in dispute. p. 6 Thus, although the sum in dispute be very\nconsiderable, one may stake two hundred Pa _n_ as, or a hundred Pa _n_ as, or\nfifty Pa _n_ as only.\n\n[6:5](sbe3305.htm#fr_27) According to Asahaya, the wager must not be laid till\nthe two first stages of the trial, the charge and the answer, are over. The\nwager may be laid either by the plaintiff or by the defendant. The plaintiff,\nwhose declaration has been refuted by the defendant, stakes a certain sum on\nthe issue of the case. Or the defendant, after having denied the correctness\nof the charge, stakes a certain sum on the correctness of his own statements,\nto be proved by the issue of the case. Asahaya does not say to whom the sum\nstaked has to be paid in his opinion. It may be observed that, according to\nBurmese law, which is an offshoot of the early law of India, ten per cent. of\nthe sum staked should be given to the judge and to the pleaders, and the\nremainder to the victorious party; see Richard-son's Dhammathat, p. 73. Ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 18 (see Mitakshara).\n\n[6:6](sbe3305.htm#fr_28) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 8.\n\n[6:7](sbe3305.htm#fr_29) Kula means an assemblage consisting of a few persons.\nSre _n_ i denotes an assemblage of eminent merchants, &c. Ga _n_ a denotes a\nfellowship, such as e.g. the Brahman caste. A. Other commentators take kula to\nmean a family meeting; _s_ re _n_ i, a company of artizans; ga _n_ a, an\nassembly of cohabitants. These three stages of private arbitration may be\ncompared to the modern Panchayats of India.\n\n[7:11](sbe3305.htm#fr_30) Where both parties adhere strictly to truth in their\nstatements, there is virtue or justice clearly enough, judicial procedure,\nwritten proof, and a royal edict being quite unnecessary in that case. Where\neither of the two parties is suspected to have made a false statement,\njudicial procedure has to be resorted to, which depends on the evidence given\nby witnesses. Documentary evidence ( _k_ aritra) is where the statements of\nwitnesses are consulted, written in their own hand, on a leaf, or on birch-\nbark, or on a strip of rind, or some other writing material. That suit,\nhowever, which has been decided by an edict from the king himself, is superior\nto all the rest, according to the saying, 'What has been decided in a village,\ngoes into the town. What has been decided in the town, goes before the king.\nWhat has been decided by the king, though wrongly decided, cannot be tried\nanew.' A. The term _k_ aritra has been rendered in conformity with this\ninterpretation, which is confirmed by the remarks of _K_ ande _s_ vara on this\n_s_ loka. Other commentators and several MSS. of the Narada-sm _ri_ ti read\nsvikara _n_ e or pra _s_ nakara _n_ e for pustakara _n_ e. These commentators\nexplain the term _k_ aritra in conformity with a text of B _ri_ haspati,\nWhatever is practised by a man, proper or improper, in accordance with local\nusage, is termed _k_ aritra (custom).\n\n[8:12](sbe3305.htm#fr_31) Because a lawsuit is decided by resorting, as the\ncase maybe, to any one of the four means of success, viz. conciliation,\ndivision, bribery, and force, therefore it is said to have four means. Because\nit protects or guards the four castes and the four orders, therefore it is\nsaid to benefit four. A. The four orders are the four stages in the life of a\ntwice-born man: student, householder, hermit, and ascetic.\n\n[8:13](sbe3305.htm#fr_32) If unjustly decided, it brings evil on the four\npersons mentioned in this _s_ loka. If justly decided, it confers good on\nthem. A.\n\n[8:15](sbe3305.htm#fr_33) The several functions of the eight (or ten)\n'members' of a judicial proceeding are thus described in a _s_ loka attributed\nto B _ri_ haspati. \xc2\x91The chief judge publishes the sentence. The king passes\nit. The assessors investigate the facts of the case. The law-book dictates the\njudgment, i.e. the victory of the one party, and the fine imposed on the other\nparty. Gold and silver serve the purpose of administering ordeals. Water is\nused for relieving thirst or appeasing hunger. The accountant has to compute\nthe sums. The scribe has to record the proceedings. The attendant must compel\nthe defendant and the witnesses to appear in court, and detain both plaintiff\nand defendant, if they have given no sureties.\xc2\x92 According to Asahaya, the term\n'the king's righteous officer' has to be referred to the king's chief judge,\nand by 'law-books' p. 9 are meant the compositions of Manu, Narada, Vi _s_\nvarupa, and others.\n\n[9:16](sbe3305.htm#fr_34) 16-19. Manu VIII, 4-8.\n\n[9:20](sbe3305.htm#fr_35) 20-25. The 132 divisions of the eighteen titles of\nlaw are stated as follows by Asahaya:\xc2\x97\n\n1\\. Recovery of a debt.\n\n1\\.

If a man is impeached, after having been taken with the maner,\nthe stolen goods having been found among his property, it is called a charge\nfounded on fact. In a charge founded on suspicion, the decision must be\nreferred to the gods (i.e. to an ordeal). In a charge founded on fact, the\ndecision rests with the king's judge. A.\n\n[13:29](sbe3305.htm#fr_37) The issue of a lawsuit, like its beginning, may be\ntwofold. Either a just decision is given, in accordance with fact, or the\ndecision is erroneous. A.\n\n[14:31](sbe3305.htm#fr_38) 'Brought forward,' i.e. stated by the plaintiff.\nThe king shall neglect it, i.e. not accept it as correct. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya II, 19.\n\n[14:32](sbe3305.htm#fr_39) The idea that fire is composed of seven rays or\nflames is derived, no doubt, from the seven rays of the sun-god Surya, who is\nrepresented down to the present day as riding in a chariot drawn by seven\nhorses.\n\n[14:34](sbe3305.htm#fr_40) 'Discarding selfish motives,' i.e. free from love\nor wrath (sine ira et studio). 'The part of Yama,' the king of righteousness,\ni.e. the distribution of the rewards and punishments due to good and bad\nactions. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 1; Vish _n_ u III, 92, &c.\n\n[14:35](sbe3305.htm#fr_41) While consulting the law-book, he should take heed\nat the same time of whatever is brought forward by the assessors of the court\nconjointly with the chief judge. He should abide by the opinion delivered by\nthe latter. He should try causes in due order, i.e. so that the four feet of a\njudicial proceeding follow one another in due succession. A.  Manu VIII, 1, 8,\n9; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 1, &c.\n\n[14:36](sbe3305.htm#fr_42) \xc3\x82gama, 'the connection,' i.e. the relation of the\ncase in hand to the entire system of law; 'the title of law,' its appertaining\nto a subdivision of this or that title of law; its 'cure,' i.e. it must p. 15\nbe cured like an illness, by carrying it through the four parts of a judicial\nproceeding. A.\n\n[15:38](sbe3305.htm#fr_43) As deer in a thick forest is difficult to catch,\neven so justice is difficult of attainment. A huntsman traces the game by\nfollowing up the drops of blood to the spot, though the soil may be covered by\nthick grass, where the wounded deer is seen by him. Similarly a king,\nfollowing the course of the lawsuit, traces law to the point where justice\nshines forth clearly. A. Manu VIII, 44.\n\n[15:39](sbe3305.htm#fr_44) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 21.\n\n[15:40](sbe3305.htm#fr_45) According to A., this verse inculcates the\nsuperiority of custom to written law. Thus both the practice of raising\noffspring to a deceased or disabled brother, and the remarriage of widows (see\ntwelfth title of law) are specially sanctioned in the sacred law-books. Yet\nthese two customs are opposed to established practice. Therefore subtle\nratiocination is required. A. quotes a verse to the effect that the immemorial\nusages of every province, which have been handed down from generation to\ngeneration, can never be overruled by a rule of the sacred law. Vasish _th_ a\nXVI, 4; Gautama XI, 23.\n\n[15:41](sbe3305.htm#fr_46) 'The visible path' means either ratiocination\nfounded on p. 16 internal or circumstantial evidence, or it may mean a sound\ndecision. A. Gautama XI, 24.\n\n[16:42](sbe3305.htm#fr_47) 'Justice has been stated (in 41) to be difficult to\nattain, because a man may be suspected to be a thief merely on account of\nstolen chattels being found amongst his property. Thus the great sage Ma _n_\n_d_ avya even was reproached with theft by an injudicious king, because,\nfaithful to his vow of silence, he did not make a reply when he was charged\nwith theft. Therefore it is necessary to adhibit great care in discerning\nrighteous men from evil-doers.' A. The history of Ma _n_ _d_ avya is related\nin the Mahabharata I, 4306 foll. A gang of robbers (Dasyus) being pursued by a\nguard, dropped their booty in the habitation of Ma _n_ _d_ avya the ascetic,\nand hid themselves in his hermitage. Soon after, their pursuers arrived, and\nasked Ma _n_ _d_ avya in which direction the robbers had proceeded. The saint\nmade no reply, whereupon the guard took to searching the hermitage, in which\nthey discovered both the robbers and the stolen chattels. The thing looking\nsuspicious, they conducted both the saint and the robbers before the tribunal\nof the king, who ordered the saint to be tied to a stake. However, though tied\nto the stake and left without food, the saint remained alive. After some time,\nthe king ordered him to be released, and asked his forgiveness for the ill-\nusage offered to him.\n\n[16:43](sbe3305.htm#fr_48) 'In the case of a woman,' i.e. if the lawsuit has\nbeen instituted by a wife or daughter; or if it has been decided by a woman.\n'At night,' as the night is the proper time for sleeping, and not the proper\ntime for attending to judicial business; for it is obviously impossible to try\na cause at night. 'Outside of the village,' means 'in the wood.' A lawsuit,\nwhen decided in one of these places (or special circumstances), is not finally\ndecided and settled; the cause has therefore to be tried anew. Such is the\nmeaning of this rule. A.\n\n[17:44](sbe3305.htm#fr_49) Owing to the recondite nature of lawsuits, and on\naccount of the weakness of men's memory, which renders them unable to remember\ndistinctly any event that has occurred long ago, the defendant in a lawsuit\nmust be allowed sufficient time to prepare his answer. A. Read _ri_ _n_ adishu\nin the text.\n\n[17:45](sbe3305.htm#fr_50) 45, 46. The first rule constitutes an exception to\nthe preceding one. In the cases here mentioned the answer should be tendered\nat once. A. Gautama XIII, 40, 41; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 12, 16.\n\n[17:48](sbe3305.htm#fr_51) Local arrest is in this form: 'If you move from\nthis place, the king will arrest you.' Temporary arrest is in this form: 'You\nmust not leave this house for a certain period.' Inhibition from travelling\nconsists of a prohibition not to undertake a journey on which one has\ndetermined. Arrest relating to karman is in this form: 'You must not persevere\nin performing this or that karman (religious ceremony).' Thus according to A.\nand Viramitrodaya, p. 55. When placed under arrest of any one out of these\nfour kinds, the person arrested must not break the arrest. Otherwise he will\nbecome guilty of an offence against the king. A.\n\n[18:49](sbe3305.htm#fr_52) Kantara, 'a fearful forest,' 'a bad country,' a\ndangerous place, 'a great calamity,' a public disaster or a heavy affliction\nand the like. One who breaks an arrest which has been put on him in one of the\nplaces or on one of the occasions hitherto mentioned, does not commit a\ncriminal offence by doing so. A.\n\n[18:50](sbe3305.htm#fr_53) A. observes that this verse, though it ought not to\ncome in here, has been inserted from the original work (of Narada?). It means,\naccording to him, that both those lawsuits which have been decided by the king\nin person, and those which have been decided by friends, connections, or\nrelatives, shall be tried anew, in case the double amount of the fine ordained\nhas been paid. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 305. Perhaps the word '(or)' had better\nbe omitted.\n\n[18:51](sbe3305.htm#fr_54) 'A proper time' means 'a suitable time,' i.e. any\nother time besides the various occasions mentioned in paragraph 45. 'One who\narrests improperly,' is either one who arrests on one of the prohibited\noccasions, or one who arrests without sufficient reason. A.\n\n[18:52](sbe3305.htm#fr_55) Artizans, i.e. manual labourers, while engaged in\ntheir work. A.\n\n[19:53](sbe3305.htm#fr_56) 53, 54. 'One who has not yet arrived at years of\ndiscretion,' i.e. a boy. 'A messenger,' whether employed in the affairs of the\nking, or by a private person. 'One about to give alms,' at one of the 'Parvan'\ndays (the days of the four changes of the moon). 'One fulfilling a vow,'\nperforming a special religious observance. 'One harassed by difficulties,'\ni.e. one who has been befallen, at the time being, by a calamity from the king\nor from fate. All persons in any such situation must not be arrested. A.\n\n[19:55](sbe3305.htm#fr_57) The defendant, after having been accused by the\nplaintiff, must not proffer a counter plaint against the plaintiff, without\nhaving previously cleared himself of the charge raised against himself,\nbecause two different causes cannot be tried at one and the same time. Neither\nmust a new plaint be lodged against one who has already been impeached by\nanother, because one already hit must not be hit again. If a deer has been\nfirst hit by one huntsman, and is again hit by another hunter, the effort of\nthe latter is to no purpose. The first huntsman may justly claim the deer, and\nnot the second. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 9.\n\n[19:56](sbe3305.htm#fr_58) 'He must not alter the charge,' as e.g. by claiming\na larger or a smaller sum afterwards than he had done before. If e.g. after p.\n20 having first claimed, as being his due, a sum amounting to 20 Gadya _n_\nakas of gold, he says afterwards: This man has to give 50 drammas (drachmas)\nto my son, it is called 'receding from one's first claim and proffering\nanother claim.' A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 9.\n\n[20:58](sbe3305.htm#fr_59) Delaying one's answer under false pretences is e.g.\nif a man says, 'I am unwell just now,' or 'I am unclean just now. I make no\nanswer.' Likewise, if a man, after having been asked by the judges, does not\nspeak, or if having made a statement previously he revokes it; by such signs\nas these a man may be known to have lost his cause. A.\n\n[20:59](sbe3305.htm#fr_60) He who, after having been summoned by the king,\nmakes off; or who, having decamped and having been seized with difficulty by\nthe king's officers, does not make any reply to the questions put to him,\nshall be fined by the king, because he loses his suit. A. Manu VIII, 55, 56;\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 16.\n\n[20:60](sbe3305.htm#fr_61) If, being questioned by the judges, he does not\nuphold, i.e. maintain, a statement previously made by himself. A. The\ncommentators of Manu, in commenting on an analogous passage of the Code of\nManu (VIII, 54), give the following example. A man has made a certain\nstatement regarding the money in dispute. The judge asks him afterwards, 'Why\ndid you tender or accept the money at night?' The man thereupon does not abide\nby his own former statement. (See Jolly, translation of the eighth chapter of\np. 21 the Code of Manu.) 'He who, after having answered a question in the\nnegative previously, makes an opposite statement afterwards.' The meaning is\nas follows: He is cast, if, having been interrogated by the judges, 'Can you\nadduce any witnesses or documents?' he replies at first by saying 'I have\nnone,' and goes on to say 'I have witnesses and documents.' A. The reading\nseems faulty. See Manu.\n\n[21:61](sbe3305.htm#fr_62) If a man says he has documents or witnesses, and\nthe judges, having heard this, say to him, 'If you have witnesses, show them,'\ni.e. exhibit them; if thereupon he does not adduce them, he loses his suit. A.\nManu VIII, 57.\n\n[21:62](sbe3305.htm#fr_63) 'This wicked debtor owes me money. He declines to\nrestore it, though I can prove his obligation to pay me by witnesses and\ndocumentary evidence. Therefore I must cite him before the tribunal of the\nking.' If the claimant says so and does not produce evidence at the time when\nhe proffers his claim, but produces it afterwards, it does not make evidence.\nIf, however, a statement of this kind had been previously made, and the\nclaimant, owing to some unfortunate accident, or to forgetfulness, &c., has\nmerely failed to repeat it at the third stage of the trial (i.e. during the\njudicial inquiry), it may be renewed, and shall be examined by the judges,\nalthough the case had already been decided, and sureties been given and taken.\nA. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 20.\n\n[22:64](sbe3305.htm#fr_64) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 19.\n\n[22:65](sbe3305.htm#fr_65) A lawsuit is 'decided' at the time when the judges,\nafter having come to a unanimous agreement about the verdict to be passed on\nthe plaintiff and defendant, give them a written record of their respective\nvictory and defeat. The 'punishment has been declared' when the judges, after\npassing the verdict, dictate a certain punishment, in accordance with the\ncomparative heaviness or lightness of the offence committed. In both cases, if\na man considers himself to have lost his cause through an unjust sentence, he\nmay have the cause tried anew, if he pledges himself to pay twice the amount\nof the fine to the king's judge. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 305.\n\n[22:66](sbe3305.htm#fr_66) 'Where an unjust sentence has been passed, the\nblame attaches to the assessors of the court. Therefore they have to pay that\nfine.' A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 4.\n\n[22:67](sbe3305.htm#fr_67) 'Wrath' is when he bears him an old grudge.\n'Ignorance' means folly. That is done 'through covetousness' which is done in\nconsideration of a bribe. 'He who passes an unjust sentence,' i.e. who says\nwhat is opposed to justice. Such an assessor has to be considered as 'no\nassessor of the court,' i.e. he is unworthy to sit in the court. A.\n\n[23:68](sbe3305.htm#fr_68) The two following paragraphs show what is meant by\n'the diversity of men's minds.' A.\n\n[23:72](sbe3305.htm#fr_69) As the sky has the appearance of a level plain like\nthe earth, yet there is nothing like earth about it; and as there is no fire\nin the fire-fly, although it sparks like fire; even so the utterances of men\nare often untrue, though they may have the appearance of true statements.\nTherefore it is necessary to examine strictly even what a man professes to\nhave seen with his own eyes.
