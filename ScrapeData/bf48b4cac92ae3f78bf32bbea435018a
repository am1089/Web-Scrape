How hath this weakness taken thee?  \nWhence springs  \nThe inglorious trouble, shameful to the brave,  \nBarring the path of virtue? Nay, Arjun!  \nForbid thyself to feebleness! it mars  \nThy warrior-name! cast off the coward-fit!  \nWake! Be thyself! Arise, Scourge of thy Foes!  \nArjuna. How can I, in the battle, shoot with shafts  \nOn Bhishma, or on Drona- O thou Chief!-  \nBoth worshipful, both honourable men?\n\nBetter to live on beggar\'s bread  \nWith those we love alive,  \nThan taste their blood in rich feasts spread,  \nAnd guiltily survive!  \nAh! were it worse- who knows?- to be  \nVictor or vanquished here,  \nWhen those confront us angrily  \nWhose death leaves living drear?  \nIn pity lost, by doubtings tossed,  \nMy thoughts- distracted- turn  \nTo Thee, the Guide I reverence most,  \nThat I may counsel learn:  \nI know not what would heal the grief  \nBurned into soul and sense,  \nIf I were earth\'s unchallenged chief-  \nA god- and these gone thence!\n\n_Sanjaya._ So spake Arjuna to the Lord of Hearts,  \nAnd sighing, "I will not fight!" held silence then.  \nTo whom, with tender smile, (O Bharata!)  \nWhile the Prince wept despairing \'twixt those hosts,  \nKrishna made answer in divinest verse:  \nKrishna. Thou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak\'st  \nWords lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart  \nMourn not for those that live, nor those that die.  \nNor I, nor thou, nor any one of these,  \nEver was not, nor ever will not be,  \nFor ever and for ever afterwards.  \nAll, that doth live, lives always! To man\'s frame  \nAs there come infancy and youth and age,  \nSo come there raisings-up and layings-down  \nOf other and of other life-abodes,  \nWhich the wise know, and fear not. This that irks-  \nThy sense-life, thrilling to the elements-  \nBringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys,  \n\'Tis brief and mutable! Bear with it, Prince!  \nAs the wise bear. The soul which is not moved,  \nThe soul that with a strong and constant calm  \nTakes sorrow and takes joy indifferently,  \nLives in the life undying! That which is  \nCan never cease to be; that which is not  \nWill not exist. To see this truth of both  \nIs theirs who part essence from accident,  \nSubstance from shadow. Indestructible,  \nLearn thou! the Life is, spreading life through all;  \nIt cannot anywhere, by any means,  \nBe anywise diminished, stayed, or changed.  \nBut for these fleeting frames which it informs  \nWith spirit deathless, endless, infinite,  \nThey perish. Let them perish, Prince! and fight!  \nHe who shall say, "Lo! I have slain a man!"  \nHe who shall think, "Lo! I am slain!" those both  \nKnow naught! Life cannot slay. Life is not slain!  \nNever the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never;  \nNever was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams!  \nBirthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for  \never;  \nDeath hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it  \nseems!  \nWho knoweth it exhaustless, self-sustained,  \nImmortal, indestructible,- shall such  \nSay, "I have killed a man, or caused to kill?"\n\nNay, but as when one layeth  \nHis worn-out robes away,  \nAnd, taking new ones, sayeth,  \n"These will I wear to-day!"  \nSo putteth by the spirit  \nLightly its garb of flesh,  \nAnd passeth to inherit  \nA residence afresh.\n\nI say to thee weapons reach not the Life;  \nFlame burns it not, waters cannot o\'erwhelm,  \nNor dry winds wither it. Impenetrable,  \nUnentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched,  \nImmortal, all-arriving, stable, sure,  \nInvisible, ineffable, by word  \nAnd thought uncompassed, ever all itself,  \nThus is the Soul declared! How wilt thou, then,-  \nKnowing it so,- grieve when thou shouldst not grieve?  \nHow, if thou hearest that the man new-dead  \nIs, like the man new-born, still living man-  \nOne same, existent Spirit- wilt thou weep?  \nThe end of birth is death; the end of death  \nIs birth: this is ordained! and mournest thou,  \nChief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls  \nWhich could not otherwise befall? The birth  \nOf living things comes unperceived; the death  \nComes unperceived; between them, beings perceive:  \nWhat is there sorrowful herein, dear Prince?\n\nWonderful, wistful, to contemplate!  \nDifficult, doubtful, to speak upon!  \nStrange and great for tongue to relate,  \nMystical hearing for every one!  \nNor wotteth man this, what a marvel it is,  \nWhen seeing, and saying, and hearing are done!\n\nThis Life within all living things, my Prince!  \nHides beyond harm; scorn thou to suffer, then,  \nFor that which cannot suffer. Do thy part!  \nBe mindful of thy name, and tremble not!  \nNought better can betide a martial soul  \nThan lawful war; happy the warrior  \nTo whom comes joy of battle- comes, as now,  \nGlorious and fair, unsought; opening for him  \nA gateway unto Heav\'n. But, if thou shunn\'st  \nThis honourable field- a Kshattriya-  \nIf, knowing thy duty and thy task, thou bidd\'st  \nDuty and task go by- that shall be sin!  \nAnd those to come shall speak thee infamy  \nFrom age to age; but infamy is worse  \nFor men of noble blood to bear than death!  \nThe chiefs upon their battle-chariots  \nWill deem \'twas fear that drove thee from the fray.  \nOf those who held thee mighty-souled the scorn  \nThou must abide, while all thine enemies  \nWill scatter bitter speech of thee, to mock  \nThe valour which thou hadst; what fate could fall  \nMore grievously than this? Either- being killed-  \nThou wilt win Swarga\'s safety, or- alive  \nAnd victor- thou wilt reign an earthly king.  \nTherefore, arise, thou Son of Kunti! brace  \nThine arm for conflict, nerve thy heart to meet-  \nAs things alike to thee- pleasure or pain,  \nProfit or ruin, victory or defeat:  \nSo minded, gird thee to the fight, for so  \nThou shalt not sin!  \nThus far I speak to thee  \nAs from the "Sankhya"- unspiritually-  \nHear now the deeper teaching of the Yog,  \nWhich holding, understanding, thou shalt burst  \nThy Karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds.  \nHere shall no end be hindered, no hope marred,  \nNo loss be feared: faith- yea, a little faith-  \nShall save thee from the anguish of thy dread.  \nHere, Glory of the Kurus! shines one rule-  \nOne steadfast rule- while shifting souls have laws  \nMany and hard. Specious, but wrongful deem  \nThe speech of those ill-taught ones who extol  \nThe letter of their Vedas, saying, "This  \nIs all we have, or need;" being weak at heart  \nWith wants, seekers of Heaven: which comes- they say-  \nAs "fruit of good deeds done;" promising men  \nMuch profit in new births for works of faith;  \nIn various rites abounding; following whereon  \nLarge merit shall accrue towards wealth and power;  \nAlbeit, who wealth and power do most desire  \nLeast fixity of soul have such, least hold  \nOn heavenly meditation. Much these teach,  \nFrom Veds, concerning the "three qualities;"  \nBut thou, be free of the "three qualities,"  \nFree of the "pairs of opposites," and free  \nFrom that sad righteousness which calculates;  \nSelf-ruled, Arjuna! simple, satisfied.  \nLook! like as when a tank pours water forth  \nTo suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw  \nText for all wants from tank of Holy Writ.  \nBut thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward  \nOf doing right in right! Let right deeds be  \nThy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.  \nAnd live in action! Labour! Make thine acts  \nThy piety, casting all self aside,  \nContemning gain and merit; equable  \nIn good or evil: equability  \nIs Yog, is piety!  \nYet, the right act  \nIs less, far less, than the right-thinking mind.  \nSeek refuge in thy soul; have there thy heaven!  \nScorn them that follow virtue for her gifts!  \nThe mind of pure devotion- even here-  \nCasts equally aside good deeds and bad,  \nPassing above them. Unto pure devotion  \nDevote thyself: with perfect meditation  \nComes perfect act, and the righthearted rise-  \nMore certainly because they seek no gain-  \nForth from the bands of body, step by step,  \nTo highest seats of bliss. When thy firm soul  \nHath shaken off those tangled oracles  \nWhich ignorantly guide, then shall it soar  \nTo high neglect of what\'s denied or said,  \nThis way or that way, in doctrinal writ.  \nTroubled no longer by the priestly lore,  \nSafe shall it live, and sure; steadfastly bent  \nOn meditation. This is Yog- and Peace!  \nArjuna. What is his mark who hath that steadfast heart,  \nConfirmed in holy meditation? How  \nKnow we his speech, Kesava? Sits he, moves he  \nLike other men?  \nKrishna. When one, O Pritha\'s Son!-  \nAbandoning desires which shake the mind-  \nFinds in his soul full comfort for his soul,  \nHe hath attained the Yog- that man is such!  \nIn sorrows not dejected, and in joys  \nNot overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress  \nOf passion, fear, and anger; fixed in calms  \nOf lofty contemplation;- such an one  \nIs Muni, is the Sage, the true Recluse!  \nHe who to none and nowhere overbound  \nBy ties of flesh, takes evil things and good  \nNeither desponding nor exulting, such  \nBears wisdom\'s plainest mark He who shall draw  \nAs the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe  \nUnder its shield, his five frail senses back  \nUnder the spirit\'s buckler from the world  \nWhich else assails them, such an one, my Prince!  \nHath wisdom\'s mark! Things that solicit sense  \nHold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes,  \nThe appetites of him who lives beyond  \nDepart,- aroused no more. Yet may it chance,  \nO Son of Kunti that a governed mind  \nShall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest  \nStrong self-control by the roots. Let him regain  \nHis kingdom! let him conquer this, and sit  \nOn Me intent. That man alone is wise  \nWho keeps the mastery of himself! If one  \nPonders on objects of the sense, there springs  \nAttraction; from attraction grows desire,  \nDesire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds  \nRecklessness; then the memory- all betrayed-  \nLets noble purpose go, and saps the mind,  \nTill purpose, mind, and man are all undone.  \nBut, if one deals with objects of the sense  \nNot loving and not hating, making them  \nServe his free soul, which rests serenely lord,  \nLo! such a man comes to tranquillity;  \nAnd out of that tranquillity shall rise  \nThe end and healing of his earthly pains,  \nSince the will governed sets the soul at peace.  \nThe soul of the ungoverned is not his,  \nNor hath he knowledge of himself; which lacked,  \nHow grows serenity? and, wanting that,  \nWhence shall he hope for happiness?  \nThe mind  \nThat gives itself to follow shows of sense  \nSeeth its helm of wisdom rent away,  \nAnd, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives  \nTo wreck and death. Only with him, great Prince!  \nWhose senses are not swayed by things of sense-  \nOnly with him who holds his mastery,  \nShows wisdom perfect. What is midnight-gloom  \nTo unenlightened souls shines wakeful day  \nTo his clear gaze; what seems as wakeful day  \nIs known for night, thick night of ignorance,  \nTo his true-seeing eyes. Such is the Saint!  \nAnd like the ocean, day by day receiving  \nFloods from all lands, which never overflows;  \nIts boundary-line not leaping, and not leaving,  \nFed by the rivers, but unswelled by those;-  \nSo is the perfect one! to his soul\'s ocean  \nThe world of sense pours streams of witchery,  \nThey leave him as they find, without commotion,  \nTaking their tribute, but remaining sea.  \nYea! whoso, shaking off the yoke of flesh  \nLives lord, not servant, of his lusts; set free  \nFrom pride, from passion, from the sin of "Self,"  \nToucheth tranquillity! O Pritha\'s Son!  \nThat is the state of Brahm! There rests no dread  \nWhen that last step is reached! Live where he will,  \nDie when he may, such passeth from all \'plaining,  \nTo blest Nirvana, with the Gods, attaining.\n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER II OF THE  \nBHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled "Sankhya-Yog,"  \nOr "The Book of Doctrines."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 3: Virtue in Work.](bg03.htm)\n\n'
