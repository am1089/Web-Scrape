Vyasa said :-- O king! Rama and Lak _s_ ma _n_ a, discussing thus,\nremained silent; when the Ri _s_ i Narada appeared there from the sky above,\nsinging the Rathantara Sama Veda hymns in tune and musical gamut with his\nrenowned lute.\n\n\n\n3-4. Ramachandra, of indomitable prowess, on beholding him rose up from his\nseat and gave him quickly an excellent seat and offerings of water for washing\nhis feet. Then he worshipped the Muni and stood with folded hands. When the\nMuni ordered him, he took his seat close by Narada.\n\n\n\n5-8. On Ramachandra taking his seat there with Lak _s_ ma _n_ a with a\ngrievous heart, Narada asked him in a sweet tone \xc2\x93O Descendant of Raghu! Why\nare you being afflicted with sorrows like an ordinary mortal? I know that the\nevil minded Rava _n_ a has stolen Sita Devi. I heard while in the heavens that\nRava _n_ a, the descendant of Pulastya, stole away Janaki, out of fascination,\ncould not know that would be the cause of his death. O Descendant in the\nfamily of Kakutstha! It is for the killing of Rava _n_ a that your birth has\ntaken place; and for that purpose Janaki has been stolen now.\n\n\n\nNote :-- The real Janaki was not stolen; Her shadow form was stolen.\n\n\n\np. 245\n\n\n\n9-12. O Raghava! The Devi Janaki, in her previous birth, was the daughter of a\nMuni and practised asceticism. While engaged in her austerities, in her holy\nhermitage, Rava _n_ a came and looking at her, prayed that beautiful woman to\nbecome his wife. Hearing this, she gave a good reproach to Rava _n_ a, when he\nperforce caught hold of her hairs. That ascetic woman got very angry, and,\nconsidering her body polluted by the devil\xc2\x92s contact, resolved to put an end\nto her life and cursed Rava _n_ a, thus :-- \xc2\x93O Villain! I will be born on the\nsurface of the earth, not from any womb but simply for your destruction and\nruin.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, she parted with her life.\n\n\n\n13\\. O Tormentor of the foes! Rava _n_ a, the king of the Rak _s_ asas,\nmistook a garland for the extremely poisonous serpent and has stolen away Sita\nDevi, the part incarnation of Lak _s_ mi, in order to root out his race.\n\n\n\n14\\. O Kakutstha! When the Devas prayed for the destruction of that wicked\ninsolent Rava _n_ a, difficult to be subdued, you are born on this earth, in\nthe family of Aja, as a part incarnate of Hari, beyond birth, old age and\ndeath.\n\n\n\n15\\. O mighty-armed! Have patience; Sita Devi is meditating you, day and\nnight.\n\n\n\n16-17. Indra himself, the king of the Devas, sends the nectar and the Heavenly\nCow\xc2\x92s Milk in a pot to Her daily; and She subsists on that, alone.\n\n\n\nO Lord! On drinking the Heavenly Cow\xc2\x92s Milk, the lotus eyed Sita Devi is\nliving without any hunger or thirst! I use to see Her daily.\n\n\n\n18\\. O Descendant of Raghu! I am now telling how that Rava _n_ a can be\nkilled. Perform, in this very month of \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92vin, the vow with devotion.\n\n\n\n19\\. Fasting for nine nights, the worship of the Bhagavati, and repeating the\nMantram silently and performing the Homa ceremony, observing all the rules,\nwill certainly fulfill one\xc2\x92s all the desires.\n\n\n\n20\\. O the best in the race of Raghu! You should offer the sacrifice before\nthe Goddess of a sacred and unblameable animal, perform Japam and Homa\nceremony equivalent to one-tenth of Japam. If you do all this, you will\ncertainly be able to release Sita.\n\n\n\n21\\. In days of yore, Vi _sn_ u, S\xc2\x92iva and Brahma and the Devas in the Heavens\nall performed this worship of the Goddess.\n\n\n\n22\\. Therefore, O Raghava! Every person desiring happiness, specially those\nthat have fallen under great difficulties, ought to do this auspicious\nceremony, without the least hesitation.\n\n\n\np. 246\n\n\n\n23-24. O Kakutstha! Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, Bhrigu, Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha and Kas\xc2\x92yapa all of\nthem did this worship before. When some stole away the wife of Brihaspati, the\nGuru of the Devas, he, too, by the force of this worship, got his wife back.\nTherefore O king! dost thou also celebrate the Puja for the destruction of\nRava _n_ a.\n\n\n\n25-26. O high minded one! This vow was practised before by Indra for the\ndestruction of Vritra, by S\xc2\x92iva for killing the demon Tripura, by Naraya _n_ a\nfor the killing of the demons Madhu and Kai _t_ ava; so you should also firmly\nresolve to perform duly this vow with your whole heart.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n27\\. Rama replied :-- \xc2\x93O Ocean of Knowledge! Who is that Devi? What is Her\ninfluence; whence has She sprung? What is Her Name? And how is that vow to be\nduly observed? Kindly describe all these to me in detail.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n28\\. Narada answered :-- \xc2\x93Listen, O Raghava! That Goddess is Eternal and Ever\nConstant Primordial Force. If you worship Her, all your difficulties will be\nremoved and all your desires will be fulfilled.\n\n\n\n29. She is the source of Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and others and of all these living beings. Without Her force, no body would be able even to move their limbs.\n\n\n\n30\\. That Supreme Auspicious Goddess is the preserving energy of Vi _sn_ u, is\nthe creative power of Brahma, and is the destroying force of S\xc2\x92iva.\n\n\n\n31\\. Whatever there exists in this infinite Universe, whether Temporal or\nEternal, She is the Underlying Force of all; how, then, can She have an\norigin!\n\n\n\n32-33. Her origin is not Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, Mahes\xc2\x92a, Sun, Indra, or the other\nDevas, not this Earth nor this Upholder of the Earth; She is devoid of any\nqualities, the Giver of Salvation of all, the Full Prakriti. In the time of\nthe final dissolution of this Universe, She lives with the Supreme Puru _s_ a.\n\n\n\n34\\. She is also Sagu _n_ a, full of qualities, and is the Creatrix of Brahma,\nVi _sn_ u and Mahes\xc2\x92a, and has empowered them, in every way, to create the\nthree Lokas.\n\n\n\n35\\. She is the Supreme Knowledge, existing before the Vedas, and the\nOriginator of the Vedas. The individual souls, knowing Her Nature, become able\nto free themselves from the bondages of the world.\n\n\n\n36\\. She is known by endless names. The Brahma, and the other Devas might\nchoose to call Her according to their actions and qualities. I am unable to\ndescribe those names.\n\n\n\np. 247\n\n\n\n37\\. O descendant in the race of Raghu! Her endless names are formed by the\nvarious combinations of the various vowels and consonants from the letter \xc2\x91A\xc2\x92\nto the letter \xc2\x91K _s_ a.\xc2\x92\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n38\\. Rama said :-- \xc2\x93O best of the Munis! Describe briefly all the rules and\nregulations as to how that vow and worship are to be performed. With my heart,\nfull of devotion and faith, I will worship the Goddess today.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n39\\. Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Raghava! On a level plot of ground, prepare an altar.\nPlace the Goddess there and fast for nine days.\n\n\n\n40\\. O king! I will be your priest and I will, with great energy, carry out\nthis yaj\xc3\xb1a to fullfil the work of the Gods.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n41-42. Vyasa said :-- Then the powerful Bhagavan Hari, hearing all from the\nMuni, believed them to be true; and, on the approach of the month of \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92vin,\nprepared the altar on the top of a hill and placed the Auspicious Goddess, the\nWorld Mother and, observing all the rules, performed the vow and worshipped\nthe Goddess.\n\n\n\n43\\. Fasting for nine days, Rama celebrated the vow and duly offered\nsacrifices, performed the worship and Homa ceremonies.\n\n\n\n44-46. When, on the grand night of the Eighth lunar day, the two brothers\ncompleted the vow as told by Narada, the Supreme Bhagavati was pleased with\nthe worship and appeared before them, mounted on a lion, and remaining there\non the mountain top, addressed Rama and Lak _s_ ma _n_ a, in a sweet grave\ntone, like the rumbling of a rain cloud, thus :-- \xc2\x93Rama, I am satisfied with\nyour worship; ask from me what you desire.\n\n\n\n47\\. Rama! You are sent by the gods for the destruction of Rava _n_ a and are\nborn as a part incarnate of Naraya _n_ a, in the pure and stainless family of\nManu.\n\n\n\n48\\. It is You that, in ancient times, incarnated as a fish for serving the\npurpose of the Devas and preserved the Vedas by killing the terrible Rak _s_\nasas for the welfare of the Universe.\n\n\n\n49\\. It is You that incarnated as a tortoise and held aloft the Mandara\nmountain, churned the ocean and nourished the Devas.\n\n\n\n50-51. O Rama! It is You that incarnated, in days of yore, as a boar and held\naloft on your teeth this earth. It is You that assumed the form of a Man-Lion\nand preserved Prahlada, by tearing asunder the body of Hira _n_ ya Kas\xc2\x92ipu, by\nYour sharp nails.\n\n\n\n52\\. O Descent of Raghu! It is You that assumed, in ancient times, the form of\na dwarf and served the purpose of the Devas, by deceitfully cheating Bali, the\nyounger of Indra.\n\n\n\np. 248\n\n\n\n53\\. O son of Kaus\xc2\x92alya! You incarnated as the son of Jamadagni in the Brahmi\n_n_ family, extirpated the line of K _s_ attriya kings and gave over this\nwhole earth to Bhagavan Kas\xc2\x92yapa Ri _s_ i.\n\n\n\n54\\. So You are now born as the son of Das\xc2\x92aratha, in the stainless race of\nKakutstha, at the request of the Devas, harassed by Rava _n_ a.\n\n\n\n55-56. These powerful monkeys, born as Deva incarnates, all endowed with great\npower by Me, will help you. Your younger Lak _s_ ma _n_ a is the incarnate of\nS\xc2\x92e _s_ a serpent; this indomitable man will kill undoubtedly Indragit, the\nson of Rava _n_ a.\n\n\n\n57\\. You will kill Rava _n_ a; then you would worship Me, with great devotion,\nin the vernal season and then enjoy your kingdom according to your liking.\n\n\n\n58\\. O best of the Raghus! For full eleven thousand years you will reign on\nthis earth; and after that reenter your heavenly abode.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n59\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! Thus saying, the Devi disappeared. Rama Chandra\nbecame very glad and, completing that most auspicious ceremony, performed the\nBejoya Puja on the tenth day and gave lots of presents to Narada and made him\ngo towards the ocean.\n\n\n\n60-61. O king! Thus stimulated by the Supreme Energy, the Highest Goddess\nbrought front to front, Ramachandra, the husband of Kamala, went to the shores\nof the ocean, accompanied by Lak _s_ ma _n_ a and the monkeys. Then he erected\nthe bridge across the ocean and killed Rava _n_ a, the enemy of the gods. His\nunparalleled fame spread everywhere throughout the three Lokas.\n\n\n\n62\\. He who hears with devotion this excellent account of the Devi, will get\nthe greatest happiness in this world, and, in the end, will get the final\nbeatitude. There is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n63\\. O king! There are extant many other Pura _n_ as, but none is equal to\nthis S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam. Know, this is my firm belief.\n\n\n\nHere ends the thirtieth chapter on the narration of the Navaratra ceremony by\nNarada and the performance of that by Rama Chandra in the 3rd Adhyaya in S\xc2\x92ri\nMad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa. Here ends the\nThird Book.\n\n\n\nThe Third Skandha completed.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 1](bk04ch01.htm)\n\n'
