(And) because that which is stated by Sm _ri_ ti (i.e. the shape of the\nhighest Lord as described by Sm _ri_ ti) is an inference (i.e. an indicatory\nmark from which we infer the meaning of _S_ ruti).\n\nThe highest Lord only is Vai _s_ vanara, for that reason also that Sm _ri_ ti\nascribes to the highest Lord only a shape consisting of the threefold world,\nthe fire constituting his mouth, the heavenly world his head, &c. So, for\ninstance, in the following passage, 'He whose mouth is fire, whose head the\nheavenly world, whose navel the ether, whose feet the earth, whose eye the\nsun, whose ears the regions, reverence to him the Self of the world.' The\nshape described here in Sm _ri_ ti allows us to infer a _S_ ruti passage on\nwhich the Sm _ri_ ti rests, and thus constitutes an inference, i.e. a sign\nindicatory of the word 'Vai _s_ vanara' denoting the highest Lord. For,\nalthough the quoted Sm _ri_ ti passage contains a glorification 1,\n\np. 146\n\nstill even a glorification in the form in which it there appears is not\npossible, unless it has a Vedic passage to rest on.--Other Sm _ri_ ti passages\nalso may be quoted in connexion with this Sutra, so, for instance, the\nfollowing one, 'He whose head the wise declare to be the heavenly world, whose\nnavel the ether, whose eyes sun and moon, whose ears the regions, and whose\nfeet the earth, he is the inscrutable leader of all beings.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[145:1](sbe34062.htm#fr_159) And as such might be said not to require a basis\nfor its statements.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 26](sbe34063.htm)\n\n"
