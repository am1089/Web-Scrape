(On the soul's) having approached (the highest light) there is\nmanifestation; (as we infer) from the word 'own.'\n\nThe Suras now proceed to consider the _kind_ of superior existence (ai _s_\nvarya) which the released souls enjoy.--The text says, 'Thus does that serene\nbeing, having risen from the body and having approached the highest light,\nmanifest itself in its own form' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 3). Does this passage\nmean that the soul having approached the highest light assumes a new body, to\nbe brought about then, as e.g. the body of a deva; or that it only manifests\nits own natural character?--The text must be understood in the former sense,\nthe Purvapakshin holds. For otherwise the scriptural texts referring to\nRelease would declare what is of no advantage to man. We do not observe that\nits own nature is of any advantage to the soul. In the state of dreamless\nsleep the body and the sense-organs cease to act, and you may say the pure\nsoul then abides by itself, but in what way does this benefit man? Nor can it\nbe said that mere cessation of pain constitutes the well-being of the soul\nwhich has approached the highest light, and that in this sense manifestation\nof its own nature may be called Release; for Scripture clearly teaches that\nthe released soul enjoys an infinity of positive bliss, 'One hundred times the\nbliss of Pra _g_ apati is one bliss of Brahman and of a sage free from\ndesires'; 'for having tasted a flavour he experiences bliss' (Taitt. Up. II,\n7). Nor can it be said that the true nature of the soul is consciousness of\nthe nature of unlimited bliss which, in the Sa _m_ sara condition, is hidden\nby Nescience and manifests itself only when the soul reaches Brahman. For, as\nexplained previously, intelligence which is of the nature of light cannot be\nhidden; hiding in that case would be neither more nor less than destruction.\nNor can that which is mere light be of the nature of bliss; for bliss is\npleasure, and to be of the nature\n\np. 756\n\nof pleasure is to be such as to agree with the Self. But, if the Self is mere\nlight, where is the being by which light is to be apprehended as agreeable to\nits own nature? (i.e. where is the knowing subject conscious of bliss?) He,\ntherefore, who holds the Self to be mere light, can in no way prove that it is\nof the nature of bliss. If, moreover, that which the soul effects on\napproaching the highest light is merely to attain to its own true nature, we\npoint out that that nature is something eternally accomplished, and that hence\nthe declaration that 'it manifests (accomplishes) itself in its own nature'\nwould be purportless. We hence conclude that on approaching the highest light\nthe soul connects itself with a new form only then brought about. On this view\nthe term 'accomplishes itself is taken in its direct sense, and the expression\n'in its own shape' also is suitable in so far as the soul accomplishes itself\nin a nature specially belonging to it and characterised by absolute bliss.--\nThis view the Sutra rejects. That special condition into which the soul passes\non having, on the path of the Gods, approached the highest light is a\nmanifestation of its own true nature, not an origination of a new character.\nFor this is proved--by the specification implied in the term 'own,' in the\nphrase 'in its own nature.' If the soul assumed a new body, this specification\nwould be without meaning; for, even without that, it would be clear that the\nnew body belongs to the soul.--Against the assertion that the soul's own true\nnature is something eternally accomplished, and that hence a declaration of\nthat nature 'accomplishing itself would be unmeaning, the next Sutra declares\nitself.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
