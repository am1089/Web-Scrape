O chiefs, remain.  \nWatch Rama there with keenest eye,  \nAnd all his deeds and movements spy.  \nGo forth, no helping art neglect,  \nBe brave and prompt and circumspect,  \nAnd be your one endeavour still  \nTo aid mine arm this foe to kill.  \nOft have I seen your warrior might  \nProved in the forehead of the fight,  \nAnd sure of strength I know so well  \nSend you in Janasthan to dwell.'  \n   The giants heard with prompt assent  \n     The pleasant words he said,  \n   And each before his master bent  \n     For meet salute, his head.  \n   Then as he bade, without delay,  \n     From Lanka's gate they passed,  \n   And hurried forward on their way  \n     Invisible and fast.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LV.: Sita In Prison.](ry253.htm)\n\n"
