He sees here, he sees yonder, he sees in the distance, he sees--the sky,\nthe atmosphere as well as the earth, all that, O goddess, he sees.  \n2\\. The three heavens, the three earths, and these six directions severally;\nall creatures may I see through thee, O divine plant!  \n3\\. Thou art verily the eyeball of the divine eagle; thou didst ascend the\nearth as a weary woman a palanquin.  \n4\\. The thousand-eyed god shall put this plant into my right hand: with that\ndo I see every one, the Sudra as well as the \xc3\x82rya.  \n5\\. Reveal (all) forms, do not hide thy own self; moreover, do thou, O\nthousand-eyed (plant), look the Kimidins in the face!  \n6\\. Reveal to me the wizards, and reveal the witches, reveal all the Pisakas:\nfor this purpose do I take hold of thee, O plant!  \n7\\. Thou art the eye of Kasyapa, and the eye of the four-eyed bitch. Like the\nsun, moving in the bright day, make thou the Pisaka evident to me!  \n8\\. I have dragged out from his retreat the sorcerer and the Kimidin. Through\nthis (charm) do I see every one, the Sudra as well as the \xc3\x82rya.  \n9\\. Him that flies in the air, him that moves across the sky, him that regards\nthe earth as his resort, that Pisaka do thou reveal (to me)!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 17.
