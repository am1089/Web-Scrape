Without a commentary, the Aphorisms are scarcely intelligible; they\nbeing designed, not so much to communicate the doctrine of the particular\nschool, as to aid, by the briefest possible suggestions, the memory of him to\nwhom the doctrine shall have been already communicated. To this end they are\nadmirably adapted; and, this being their end, the obscurity which must needs\nattach to them, in the eyes of the uninstructed, is not chargeable upon them\nas a fault.\n\n   For various reasons it is desirable that there should be an accurate\ntranslation of the Aphorisms, with so much of gloss as may be required to\nrender them intelligible. A class of pandits in the Benares Sanskrit College\nhaving been induced to learn English, it is contemplated that a version of the\nAphorisms, brought out in successive portions, shall be submitted to the\ncriticism of these men, and, through them, of other learned Brahmans, so that\nany errors in the version may have the best chance of being discovered and\nrectified. The employment of such a version as a class-book is designed to\nsubserve, further, the attempt to determine accurately the aspect of the\nphilosophical terminology of the East, as regards that of the West.\n\n   These pages, now submitted to the criticism of the pandits who read\nEnglish, are to be regarded as proof-sheets awaiting correction. They invite\ndiscussion.\n\nJ. R. B.  \n\n      BENARES COLLEGE,  \n    _5th January_ , 1852.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next](sak1.htm)\n\n'
