He who knows one sacrifice above another, one day above another, one deity\nabove the others, he is clever. Now this great uktha (the nishkevalya- _s_\nastra) is the sacrifice above another, the day above another, the deity above\nothers 1.\n\n2\\. This uktha is fivefold. With regard to its being performed as a Stoma\n(chorus), it is Triv _ri_ t, Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ ada _s_ a, Saptada _s_ a, Ekavi _m_ sa,\nand Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ avi _m_ sa. With regard to its being performed as a Saman (song),\nit is Gayatra, Rathantara, B _ri_ hat, Bhadra, and Ragana. With regard to\nmetre, it is Gayatri, Ush _n_ ih, B _ri_ hati, Trish _t_ ubh, and Dvipada. And\nthe explanation (given before in the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka) is that it is the head, the\nright wing, the left wing, the tail, and the body of the bird 2.\n\nin each hymn. This, is the first round. He then sings the three middle verses\nin each hymn. This is the second round. He lastly sings the last three verses\nin each hymn. This is the third round. This song is called Udyati.\n\nThe Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ ada _s_ a stoma is formed out of one Sukta only, consisting of\nthree verses. In the first round he sings the first verse p. 225 three times,\nthe second and third once. In the second round he sings the middle verse three\ntimes, in the third round he sings the last verse three times. This song is\ncalled Vish _t_ uti.\n\nThe Saptadasa stoma is formed in the same manner, only that in the first round\nhe sings the first verse three times, in the second the middle verse three\ntimes, in the third round the middle and last verses three times. This song is\ncalled Da _s_ asapta.\n\nThe Ekavi _m_ sa stoma is formed in the same manner, only that in the first\nround he sings the last verse once, in the second the first verse once, in the\nthird the middle verse once, while the other verses are each repeated three\ntimes. This song is called Saptasaptini.\n\nThe Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ avi _m_ _s_ a stoma is formed in the same manner, only that in the\nfirst round he sings the first verse three times, the second four times, the\nlast once; in the second round the first once, the second three times, the\nthird four times; in the third round the first five times, the second once,\nthe last three times; or he sings in the third round the first verse four\ntimes, the second twice, the last three times.\n\nSaya _n_ a in his commentary on the Ait. \xc3\x82r. takes the Triv _ri_ t stoma to be\nformed out of three hymns, each consisting of three verses, while he says that\nthe other stomas are formed out of one hymn only. B. and R., s _v_. triv _ri_\nt, state that this stoma consists of verses 1, 4, 7; 2, 5, 8; and 3, 6, 9 of\nthe Rig-veda hymn IX, 11, but, according to Saya _n_ a, the stoma consists (1)\nof the first verses of the three Suktas, upasmai gayata, davidyutatya, and\npavamanasya at the beginning of the Sama-veda-Uttarar _k_ ika, (2) of the\nsecond, (3) Of the third verses of the same three hymns. Mahidhara (Yv. X, 9)\ntakes the same view, though the MSS. seem to have left out the description of\nthe second paryaya, while Saya _n_ a in his commentary to the Ta _n_ _d_ ya-\nbrahma _n_ a seems to support the opinion of B. and R. There is an omission,\nhowever, in the printed text of the commentary, which makes it difficult to\nsee the exact meaning of Saya _n_ a.\n\nThe Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ ada _s_ a stoma is well described by Saya _n_ a, Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br.\nII, 4. Taking the Sukta agna a yahi (Uttarar _k_ ika I, 1, 4 = Rv. VI, 16,\n10-12), he shows the stoma to consist of (1) verse 1 \xc3\x97 3, 2, 3 (2) verse 1, 2\n\xc3\x97 3, 3; (3) verse 1, 2, 3 \xc3\x97 3.\n\nThe five Samans are explained by the commentator. The p. 226 Gayatra is formed\nout of the _Ri_ _k_ (III, 62, 10) tat savitur vare _n_ yam. The Rathantara is\nformed out of the _Ri_ _k_ (VII, 32, 22) abhi tva _s_ ura nonuma. The B _ri_\nhat is formed out of the _Ri_ _k_ (VI, 46, 1) tvam id dhi havamahe. The Bhadra\nis formed out of the _Ri_ _k_ (X, 57, 1) ima nu kam. The Ra _g_ ana is formed\nout of the _Ri_ _k_ (VII, 27, 1) indram naro nemadhita.\n\nThe metres require no explanation.\n\nIn identifying certain portions of the Nishkevalya hymn with a bird, the head\nof the bird corresponds to the hymns indram id gathina _h_ , &c.; the right\nwing to the hymns abhi tva _s_ ura, &c.; the left wing to the hymns tvam id\ndhi, &c.; the tail to the hymns ima nu kam, &c.; the body to the hymns tad id\nasa, &c. All this was explained in the first \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka.\n\np. 225\n\n3\\. He performs the Prastava in five ways, he performs the Udgitha in five\nways, he performs the\n\np. 226\n\n[paragraph continues] Pratihara in five ways, he performs the Upadrava in five\nways, he performs the Nidhana in five ways 1. All this together forms one\nthousand Stobhas, or musical syllables 2.\n\n4\\. Thus also are the _Ri_ _k_ verses, contained in the Nishkevalya, recited\n(by the Hot _ri_ ) in five orders. What precedes the eighty t _ri_ _k_ as,\nthat is one order, then follow the three sets of eighty t _ri_ _k_ as each,\nand what comes after is the fifth order 3.\n\np. 227\n\n5\\. This (the hymns of this Sastra) as a whole (if properly counted with the\nStobha syllables) comes to one thousand (of B _ri_ hati verses). That\n(thousand) is the whole, and ten, ten is called the whole. For number is such\n(measured by ten). Ten tens are a hundred, ten hundreds are a thousand, and\nthat is the whole. These are the three metres (the tens, pervading\neverything). And this food also (the three sets of hymns being represented as\nfood) is threefold, eating, drinking, and chewing. He obtains that food by\nthose (three numbers, ten, hundred, and thousand, or by the three sets of\neighty t _ri_ _k_ as).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[224:1](sbe01217.htm#fr_558) The uktha is to be conceived as pra _n_ a, breath\nor life, and this pra _n_ a was shown to be above the other powers (devatas),\nspeech, hearing, seeing, mind. The uktha belongs to the Mahavrata day, and\nthat is the most important day of the Soma sacrifice. The Soma sacrifice,\nlastly, is above all other sacrifices.\n\n[224:2](sbe01217.htm#fr_559) All these are technicalities connected with the\nsinging and reciting of the uktha. The commentator says: The stoma is a\ncollection of single _Ri_ _k_ verses occurring in the t _ri_ _k_ as which have\nto be sung. The Triv _ri_ t stoma, as explained in the Sama-brahma _n_ a, is\nas follows: There are three Suktas, each consisting of three verses, the first\nbeing upasmai gayata, S. V. Uttarar _k_ ika I, 1, 1 = Rv. IX, 11. The Udgat\n_ri_ first sings the first three verses a\n\n[224:a](sbe01217.htm#fr_560) Hi\xe1\xb9\x85k _ri_ with dative is explained as gai with\naccusative.\n\n[226:1](sbe01217.htm#fr_561) The Samagas sing the Ra _g_ ana at the Mahavrata,\nand in that Saman there are, as usual, five parts, the Prastava, Udgitha,\npratihara, Upadrava, and Nidhana. The Prastot _ri_ , when singing the Prastava\nportions, sings them five times. The Udgat _ri_ and Pratihart _ri_ sing their\nportions, the Udgitha and Pratihara, five times. The Udgat _ri_ again sings\nthe Upadrava five times. And all the Udgat _ri_ s together sing the Nidhana\nfive times.\n\n[226:2](sbe01217.htm#fr_562) The Stobha syllables are syllables without any\nmeaning, added when verses have to be sung, in order to have a support for the\nmusic. See _Kh_. Up. I, 13. In singing the five Samans, each five times, one\nthousand of such Stobha syllables are required.\n\n[226:3](sbe01217.htm#fr_563) There are in the Nishkevalya hymn, which the Hot\n_ri_ has to recite, three sets of eighty t _ri_ _k_ as each. The first,\nconsisting of Gayatris, begins with  ![](img/22600.jpg) indro ya o _g_ asa.\nThe second, consisting of B _ri_ hatis, begins with ya _k_ id anyad. The\nthird, consisting of Ush _n_ ihs, begins with ya indra somapatama. These three\nsets form the food of the bird, as the emblem of the _s_ astra. The hymns p.\n227 which precede these, form the body, head, and wings of the bird. This is\none order. Then follow the three sets of eighty t _ri_ _k_ as each; and\nlastly, the fifth order, consisting of the hymns which form the belly and the\nlegs of the bird.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 5](sbe01218.htm)\n\n'
