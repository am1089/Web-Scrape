And on account of (meditating on the part of the gods) being in the\nLight.\n\n'Him the devas meditate upon as the light of lights, as\n\np. 336\n\nimmortal time' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 16). This text declares that the meditation\nof the gods has for its object the Light, i.e. the highest Brahman. Now this\nexpress declaration as to the gods being meditating devotees with regard to\nmeditations on Brahman which are common to men and gods, implies a denial of\nthe gods being qualified for meditations on other objects. The conclusion\ntherefore is that the Vasus, and so on, are not qualified for meditations on\nthe Vasus and other classes of deities.\n\n32\\. But Badaraya _n_ a (maintains) the existence (of qualification); for\nthere is (possibility of such).\n\nThe Reverend Badaraya _n_ a thinks that the \xc3\x82dityas, Vasus, and so on, are\nalso qualified for meditations on divinities. For it is in their case also\npossible that their attainment of Brahman should be viewed as preceded by\ntheir attainment of Vasu-hood or \xc3\x82ditya-hood, in so far, namely, as they\nmeditate on Brahman as abiding within themselves. They may be Vasus and\n\xc3\x82dityas in the present age of the world, but at the same time be desirous of\nholding the same position in future ages also. In the Madhuvidya we have to\ndistinguish two sections, concerned respectively with Brahman in its causal\nand its effected state. The former section, extending from the beginning up to\n'when from thence he has risen upwards,' enjoins meditation on Brahman in its\ncondition as effect, i.e. as appearing in the form of creatures such as the\nVasus, and so on; while the latter section enjoins meditation on the causal\nBrahman viewed as abiding within the sun as its inner Self. The purport of the\nwhole vidya is that he who meditates on Brahman in this its twofold form will\nin a future age of the world enjoy Vasu-hood, and will finally attain Brahman\nin its causal aspect, i.e. the very highest Brahman. From the fact that the\ntext, 'And indeed to him who thus knows the Brahma-upanishad. the sun does not\nrise and does not set; for him there is day once and for all,' calls the whole\nMadhuvidya a ' _Brahma_ '--upanishad, and that the reward declared is the\nattainment of Vasu-hood, and so on, leading up to the attainment of Brahman,\nwe clearly are entitled to\n\np. 337\n\ninfer that the meditations which the text enjoins, viz. on the different parts\nof the sun viewed as objects of enjoyment for the Vasus, and so on, really are\nmeant as meditations on Brahman as abiding in those different forms.\nMeditation on the Vasus and similar beings is thus seen to be possible for the\nVasus themselves. And as Brahman really constitutes the only object of\nmeditation, we also see the appropriateness of the text discussed above, 'On\nhim the gods meditate as the light of lights.' The V _ri_ ttikara expresses\nthe same opinion, 'For there is possibility with regard to the Madhu-vidya,\nand so on, Brahman only being the object of meditation everywhere.'--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'honey.'\n\nThe Sutras now enter on a discussion of the question whether the _S_ udras\nalso are qualified for the knowledge of Brahman.\n\nThe Purvapakshin maintains that they are so qualified; for qualification, he\nsays, depends on want and capacity, and both these are possible in the case of\n_S_ udras also. The _S_ udra is not indeed qualified for any works depending\non a knowledge of the sacred fires, for from such knowledge he is debarred;\nbut he possesses qualification for meditation on Brahman, which after all is\nnothing but a certain mental energy. The only works prerequisite for\nmeditation are those works which are incumbent on a man as a member of a caste\nor a _s_ rama, and these consist, in the _S_ udra's case, in obedience to the\nhigher castes. And when we read 'therefore the _S_ udra is not qualified for\nsacrifices,' the purport of this passage is only to make a confirmatory\nreference to something already settled by reason, viz. that the _S_ udra is\nnot qualified for the performance of sacrifices which cannot be accomplished\nby one not acquainted with the sacred fires (and not to deny the _S_ udra's\ncompetence for devout meditation).--But how can meditation on Brahman be\nundertaken by a man who has not studied the Vedas, inclusive of the Vedanta,\nand hence knows nothing about the nature of Brahman and the proper modes of\nmeditation?--Those also, we reply, who do not study Veda and Vedanta may\nacquire the requisite knowledge by\n\np. 338\n\nhearing Itihasas and Pura _n_ as; and there are texts which allow Sudras to\nbecome acquainted with texts of that kind; cp. e.g. 'one is to make the four\ncastes to hear texts, the Brahma _n_ a coming first.' Moreover, those Pura _n_\nas and Itihasas make mention of _S_ udras, such as Vidura, who had a knowledge\nof Brahman. And the Upanishads themselves, viz. in the so-called Sa _m_ varga-\nvidya, show that a _S_ udra is qualified for the knowledge of Brahman; for\nthere the teacher Raikva addresses _G_ ana _s_ ruti, who wishes to learn from\nhim, as _S_ udra, and thereupon instructs him in the knowledge of Brahman (\n_Kh_. Up. IV, 2, 3). All this proves that _S_ udras also have a claim to the\nknowledge of Brahman.\n\nThis conclusion we deny, on the ground of the absence of capability. It is\nimpossible that the capability of performing meditations on Brahman should\nbelong to a person not knowing the nature of Brahman and the due modes of\nmeditation, and not qualified by the knowledge of the requisite preliminaries\nof such meditation, viz. recitation of the Veda, sacrifices, and so on. Mere\nwant or desire does not impart qualification to a person destitute of the\nrequired capability. And this absence of capability is due, in the _S_ udra's\ncase, to absence of legitimate study of the Veda. The injunctions of\nsacrificial works naturally connect themselves with the knowledge and the\nmeans of knowledge (i.e. religious ceremonies and the like) that belong to the\nthree higher castes, for these castes actually possess the knowledge (required\nfor the sacrifices), owing to their studying the Veda in agreement with the\ninjunction which prescribes such study for the higher castes; the same\ninjunctions do not, on the other hand, connect themselves with the knowledge\nand means of knowledge belonging to others (than members of the three higher\ncastes). And the same naturally holds good with regard to the injunctions of\nmeditation on Brahman. And as thus only such knowledge as is acquired by study\nprompted by the Vedic injunction of study supplies a means for meditation on\nBrahman, it follows that the _S_ udra for whom that injunction is not meant is\nincapable of such meditation. Itihasas\n\np. 339\n\nand Pura _n_ as hold the position of being helpful means towards meditation in\nso far only as they confirm or support the Veda, not independently of the\nVeda. And that _S_ udras are allowed to hear Itihasas and Pura _n_ as is meant\nonly for the end of destroying their sins, not to prepare them for meditation\non Brahman. The case of Vidura and other _S_ udras having been 'founded on\nBrahman,' explains itself as follows:--Owing to the effect of former actions,\nwhich had not yet worked themselves out, they were born in a low caste, while\nat the same time they possessed wisdom owing to the fact that the knowledge\nacquired by them in former births had not yet quite vanished.\n\n(On these general grounds we object to _S_ udras being viewed as qualified for\nmeditation on Brahman.) The Sutra now refutes that argument, which the\nPurvapakshin derives from the use of the word ' _S_ udra' in the Sa _m_ varga-\nvidya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 33.
