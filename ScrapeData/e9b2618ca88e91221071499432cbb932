The great\nrajah ruled his people justly; he offered up every sacrifice to the gods, and\nhe gave sumptuous gifts to holy men. Fair Damayanti became the mother of a\nbeauteous daughter, who was named Indrasena, and of a comely son, who was\nnamed Indrasen. So were the blessings of life showered upon the blissful pair.\n\nBut at length there came a day when, after performing an unclean act, Nala\nsipped holy water and went to prayer with unwashed feet. 1 The watchful Kali\nseized this fatal opportunity, and straightway entered the rajah and possessed\nhis inmost soul. Then that evil demon summoned Push\xc2\xb4kara, the brother of Nala,\nsaying: "Come now and throw dice with the king. I will give thee mine aid, so\nthat thou wilt be enabled to win the whole realm for thyself."\n\np. 341\n\nPushkara at once challenged his brother, whereupon the wicked spirit Dwapara\nentered the dice.\n\nNala gave ready consent to take part in the game of hazard, for he was swayed\nby evil Kali. Then the two rivals began to play together in the presence of\nDamayanti.\n\nThe great rajah staked his wealth, and he was worsted; he staked his golden\ntreasures and he staked his chariots, and still he was worsted; he staked his\nrich attire, and he continued to lose. The passion for dice had possessed Nala\nlike to sudden madness, and it was in vain that his friends endeavoured to\nrestrain him.\n\nIn time rumours of dire happenings went abroad through the city, whereupon the\nrajah\'s faithful subjects, accompanied by high counsellors of state, assembled\nat the palace gate with desire to prevail upon him to cease playing. They\nurged upon Damayanti to intervene, and the spirit-broken daughter of Bhima\napproached Nala in anguish and in dismay, and with tear-choking voice she\nspoke to him, saying: "All thy subjects are gathered without, for they cannot\nendure the thought that misfortune should fall upon thee."\n\nNala heard her, but answered not a word, because his soul was clouded by evil\nKali. Then the wise men said: "It is not he;" and they departed to their homes\nin sorrow and in shame. . . .\n\nSo the play went on; daily it went on through many weary months, and Nala was\nalways worsted.\n\nWhen, in the end, Damayanti perceived that all the treasures were lost, she\nsent for the faithful charioteer, Varshneya, and spoke to him, saying: "Hasten\nnow and yoke Nala\'s speedy and much-loved steeds, and place my children in the\nchariot. Then drive quickly to the city of my kindred and leave them in care\nof my father, the\n\np. 342\n\n[paragraph continues] Rajah Bhima. When thou hast done me that service, O\nVarshneya, thou mayst go wheresoever thou wilt."\n\nSo the charioteer conveyed the beauteous girl Indrasena and the comely boy\nIndrasen to the city of Vidarbha, and he delivered them safely unto Bhima,\nwhom he informed fully regarding the fall of Nala. Thereafter he departed,\nsorrowing greatly, and went to the city of Ayodhya, 1 where he took service\nwith the renowned Rajah Rituparna.\n\nNala played on; he continued to throw the dice, until at length he had lost\nall his possessions. Then Pushkara smiled and spoke to his stricken brother,\nsaying: "Now, throw but one more hazard. Where is your stake? Ah! you have\nnaught left now save Damayanti. Let us throw the dice for her."\n\nAt these words Nala\'s heart was rent in twain. Mute with sorrow, he gazed upon\nhis brother. . . . He arose and stripped off his rich vestments one by one in\nthe presence of his lamenting friends. Then slowly and in silence he went\nforth, naked and alone. Damayanti, wearing but a single garment, followed him\nbehind. Together they stood at the city gates.\n\nThen Pushkara, who had become rajah, caused to be proclaimed throughout the\ncity the dread decree: " _Whosoever giveth food or drink unto Nala shall be\nimmediately put to death_ ".\n\nIn their terror the people could not give further help to the fallen king, and\nfor three days and three nights he drank water only. Then he plucked wild\nfruit and roots from the earth, and these he ate. Nala thereafter wandered\naway from Nishadha, an outcast among men, and Damayanti followed him behind.\n\np. 343\n\nTortured by hunger, the fallen king at length beheld on the ground a flock of\nbirds with gold-flecked wings, and he said in his heart: "Now I will make me a\nwelcome feast."\n\nSo he crept forward and flung over them his single garment; but they rose in\nthe air, carrying it away with them. As they went they cried out mockingly in\nhuman language and said: "Know now, O foolish king, that we are the dice. We\ncame hither on purpose to despoil thee utterly, for so long as thou hadst left\na single garment our joy was incomplete."\n\nThereupon Nala spoke to Damayanti in his anguish, saying: "O blameless one, by\nwhose anger have I been driven from my kingdom and rendered thus unable to\nprocure any food? Listen now to my counsel. The roads diverge here before us,\nand one leads southward past the caves of holy hermits, which are stored with\nfood, towards the kingdom of thy royal sire."\n\nAnxiously did Nala point out the way and urge upon Bhima\'s fair daughter to\ntake refuge in Vidarbha ere he would enter the great forest.\n\nWeighed down by her heavy sorrow, Damayanti made answer with tear-choking\nvoice: "Alas! thy words of counsel cause my heart to break and my limbs to\nfail me. How can I leave thee all alone in trackless forest when thou hast\nlost thy kingdom and thy riches, and whilst thou art athirst and tortured by\nhunger? Rather let me comfort thee, O my husband, when in thy grief, and,\nfamine-stricken as thou now art, thou dost ponder wearily over thy lost\nhappiness, for in truth have wise physicians said that a wife is the only\nbalsam and the only healing herb for her husband\'s sorrow."\n\nSaid Nala: "Thou hast spoken truly. There is indeed no medicine for a stricken\nman like to his wife\'s\n\np. 344\n\nlove. Think not that I desire to part from thee. . . . Would that I could\nabandon myself!"\n\nDamayanti wept and said: "If thou wouldst not leave me, why, O king, dost thou\nmake heavier my sorrow by pointing out the way to Vidarbha? Thou art too noble\nto abandon me, yet thou dost show me the road southward. If it is meet that I\nshould return unto my father, come thou with me and he will bid thee welcome,\nand we could dwell together happily in his palace."\n\nNala made answer sadly: "Ah! never can I return in my shame to that city where\nI have appeared aforetime in pride and in splendour."\n\nThen, comforting Damayanti, Nala wandered on with her through the deep forest,\nand they made one garment serve them both. Greatly they suffered from hunger\nand from thirst, and when at length they came to a lonely hut, they sat down\non the hard ground, nor had they even a mat to rest upon. Damayanti was\novercome with weariness, and soon she sank asleep; she lay all naked on that\nbare floor. But there was no rest for Nala; he thought with pain of his lost\nkingdom and the friends who had deserted him, and of the weary journey he must\nmake in the midst of the great forest. "Ah! were it better to die now and end\nall," he mused, "or to desert her whom I love? She is devoted unto me more\ndeeply than I deserve. Perchance if she were abandoned she would return to\nVidarbha. She is unable to endure my sufferings and the constant sorrow which\nmust be mine."\n\nLong he pondered thus, until Kali swayed him to desert his faithful wife. So\nhe severed her garment and used half of it. He turned away from the fair\nprincess as she lay fast asleep.\n\nRepenting in his heart, Nala returned speedily and gazed upon fair Damayanti\nwith pity and with love. He\n\np. 345\n\nwept bitterly, saying: "Ah! thou dost sleep on the bare hard ground whom\nneither sun nor storm hath ever used roughly. O my loved one, thou hast ever\nawakened to smile. How wilt thou fare when thou dost discover that thy lord\nhath abandoned thee in the midst of the perilous forest? . . . May sun and\nwind and the spirits of the wood protect thee, and may thou be shielded ever\nby thine own great virtue!"\n\nThen the distracted rajah, prompted by Kali again, hastened away; but his\nheart was torn by his love, which drew him back. . . . So time and again he\ncame and went, like to a swing, backward and forward, until in the end the\nevil spirit conquered him, and he departed from Damayanti, who moaned fitfully\nin her sleep; and he plunged into the depths of the forest.\n\nEre long the fair princess awoke, and when she perceived that she was all\nalone she uttered a piteous scream and cried out: "Oh! where art thou, my\nking, my lord, my sole protector? . . . I am lost; oh! I am undone. I am\nhelpless and alone in the perilous wood. . . . Ah! now thou art but deceiving\nme. Do not mock me, my lord. Art thou hidden there among the bushes? Oh,\nspeak! . . . Why dost thou not make answer? . . . I do not sorrow for myself\nonly. I cannot well endure that thou shouldst be alone, that thou shouldst\nthirst and be an hungered and very weary, and without me to give thee comfort.\n. . ."\n\nSo she wailed as she searched through the forest for Nala, now casting herself\nupon the ground, now sitting to pine in silence, and anon crying out in her\ngrief. At length she said: "Oh, may he who causeth Nala to suffer endure even\ngreater agony than he endureth, and may he live for ever in darkness and in\nmisery!"\n\nHither and thither she wandered, seeking her lord,\n\np. 346\n\nand ever was she heard crying: "Alas! O alas! my husband."\n\nSuddenly a great serpent rose up in its wrath and coiled itself round her fair\nbody. . . .\n\n"Oh! my guardian," she cried, "I am now undone. The serpent hath seized me.\nWhy art thou not near? . . . Ah! who will comfort thee now in thy sorrow, O\nblameless Nala?"\n\nAs she lamented thus, a passing huntsman heard her cries; he broke through the\njungle and beheld Damayanti in the coils of the serpent. . . . Nimbly he\ndarted forward and with a single blow smote off the monster\'s head, and thus\nrescued the beauteous lady from her awesome peril. Then he washed her body and\ngave her food, and she was refreshed.\n\n"Who art thou, O fair-eyed one?" he asked. "Why dost thou wander thus alone in\nthe perilous wood?"\n\nDamayanti of faultless form thereupon related to the huntsman the story of her\nsorrow. As she spoke, his frail heart was moved by her great beauty, and he\nuttered amorous words with whining voice. . . . Perceiving his evil intent,\nshe was roused to fierce anger. Her chastity was her sole defence, and she\ncursed him so that he immediately fell down dead like to a tree that has been\nsmitten by lightning and is suddenly blasted. 1\n\nFreed thus from the savage huntsman of wild beasts, the lotus-eyed Damayanti\nwandered on through the deep forest, which resounded everywhere with the song\nof the cricket. All around her were trees of every form and name, and she\nbeheld shady arbours, deep valleys, and wooded hill summits, and lakes and\npools, loud resounding waterfalls, and great flowing rivers. The forest was\ndrear and appalling: it was full of lions and tigers, of\n\np. 347\n\ncountless birds and fierce robbers. She saw buffaloes and wild boars feeding,\nand the fierce and awesome forms that were there also--serpents and giants and\nterrible demons. . . . But, protected by her virtue, she wandered on all alone\nwithout fear. Her sole anxiety was for Nala, and she wept for him, crying:\n"Ah! where art thou? O blameless one, remember now thy vows and thy plighted\nfaith. Remember the words which the gold-winged swan addressed unto thee. . .\n. Am I not thy loved one? . . . Oh! why dost thou not make answer in this dark\nand perilous forest? The savage beasts are gaping to devour me. Why art thou\nnot near to save? . . . I am weak and pallid and dust-stained, and have need\nof thee, my protector. . . . Whom can I ask for Nala? The tiger is before me,\nthe king of the forest, and I am not afraid. I address him, saying: \'Oh! I am\nlonely, and wretched, and sorrowful, seeking for my exiled husband. If thou\nhast seen him, console me; if thou hast not seen him, devour me, and set me\nfree from this misery.\' . . . But the tiger turns down to the river bank, and\nI wander onward towards the holy mountain, the monarch of hills.\n\n"\' Hear me!\' I cry. I salute thee, O Mountain. . . . I am a king\'s daughter\nand the consort of a king, the illustrious lord of Nishadha, the pious, the\nfaultless one, who is courageous as the elephant. . . . Hast thou seen my\nNala, O mighty Mountain? . . . Ah! why dost thou not answer me? . . . Comfort\nthou me now as if I were thine own child. . . . Oh! shall I ever behold him\nagain, and ever hear again his honey-sweet voice, like music, saying:\n\'Daughter of Vidarbha,\' while it doth soothe all my pain with its blessed\nsound? . . ."\n\nHaving thus addressed the mountain, Damayanti turned northward and wandered on\nfor three days and three nights. Then she reached a holy grove, and\n\np. 348\n\nentered it humbly and without fear. She beheld there the cells of hermits and\ntheir bright sacred fires. The holy men were struck with wonder by reason of\nher beauty, and they bade her welcome, saying: "Art thou a goddess of the\nwood, or of the mountain, or of the river? O speak and tell."\n\nDamayanti made answer: "I am not a goddess of the wood, or a mountain spirit,\nor yet a river nymph, but a mortal woman."\n\nThen she related to the holy men the story of her sorrow and her wandering,\nand these seers spoke to her and said: "A time cometh soon, a time of beauty,\nwhen thou wilt again behold Nala in splendour and sin-released ruling over his\npeople."\n\nWhen they had spoken thus, all the holy men vanished, and their sacred fires\nvanished also. Damayanti stood a while in silent wonder, and in her heart she\nsaid: "Have I seen a vision? . . ." Then she went towards another region.\n\nLamenting for Nala, the fair one came to a beauteous asoka tree 1: its green\nbranches were gemmed with gleaming fruit, and were melodious with the songs of\nbirds. "O happy tree," she cried, "take away all my grief. . . . Say, hast\nthou beheld my Nala, the slayer of his enemies, my beloved lord? Oh! hast thou\nseen my one love, with smooth, bright skin, wandering alone in the forest?\nAnswer me, O blessed Asoka, so that I may depart from thee in joy. Ah! hear\nand speak thou happy tree. . . ."\n\nSo, wailing in her deep anguish, Damayanti moved round the asoka. Then she\nwent towards a lonelier and more fearsome region. . . . She passed many a\nriver and\n\np. 349\n\nmany mountains, and she saw numerous birds and deer as she wandered on and on,\nsearching for her lost lord.\n\nAt length she beheld a great caravan of merchants. Ponderous elephants and\neager camels, prancing horses and rumbling cars carne through a river. The\nriver banks were fringed by cane and tangled undergrowth; the curlew called\naloud there, and the osprey; red geese were clamouring; turtles were numerous,\nas were the fish and the serpents likewise. All the noble animals of the\ncaravan came splashing noisily across the ford.\n\nThe great concourse of travellers stared with wonder on the slender-waisted,\nmaniac-like woman, clad in but half a garment, smeared with dust and pale and\nsorrowful, her long hair all matted and miry. Some there were who fled from\nher in fear. But others took pity and said: "Who art thou, O lady, and what\nseekest thou in the lonely forest? Art thou a goddess of the mountain, or of\nthe forest, or of the plain? . . . We pray for thy protection; be mindful of\nour welfare so that we may prosper upon our journey."\n\nThen Damayanti told the story of her misfortune and sorrow, and all the\ntravellers gathered round about to hear--boys and young men and grey-haired\nsages. "Oh! have you beheld my lord, my Nala?" she cried unto them.\n\nThe captain of the band answered her "Nay"; and she asked him whither the\ncaravan was bound, whereat he said: "We are going towards the realm of Chedi,\nover which Subahu is king." When the merchants resumed their journey,\nDamayanti went with them.\n\nThrough the forest they travelled a long distance, and at eventide they\nreached the green shore of a beautiful wide lake which sparkled with bright\nlotus\n\np. 350\n\nblooms. 1 The camp was pitched in the middle of a deep grove. Gladly did the\nmen bathe with their wearied animals in the delicious, ice-cool waters.\n\nAt midnight all slept. . . . In the deep silence a herd of wild forest\nelephants, with moisture oozing from their temples, 2 came down to drink from\nthe gurgling stream which flowed nigh to the camp. When they scented the tame\nelephants lying crouched in slumber, they trumpeted aloud, and of a sudden\ncharged ponderously and fell upon them like to mountain peaks tumbling into\nthe valleys beneath. . . . Trees and tents were thrown down as they trampled\nthrough the camping ground, and the travellers awoke panic-stricken, crying:\n"Oh! Alas! Ah! Oh!" Some fled through the forest; others, blind with sleep,\nstood gasping with wonder, and the elephants slew them. The camp was scattered\nin the dire confusion; many animals were gored; men overthrew one another,\nendeavouring to escape; many shrieked in terror, and a few climbed trees.\nVoices were heard calling: "It is a fire!" and merchants screamed, "Why fly\naway so speedily? Save the precious jewels, O ye cowards."\n\nAmidst the tumult and the slaughter Damayanti awoke, trembling with fear, and\nshe made swift escape, nor suffered a wound. In the deep forest she came nigh\nto the few men who had found refuge, and she heard them say one to another:\n\n"What deed have we done to bring this misfortune upon us? Have we forgotten to\nadore Manibhadra 3, the high king of the Yakshas? Worshipped we not, ere we\nset forth, the dread spirits which bring disasters? Was\n\np. 351\n\nit doomed that all omens should be belied? How hath it come that such a\ndisaster hath befallen us?"\n\nOthers who had been bereft of their kindred and their wealth, and were in\nmisery, said: "Who was she--that ill-omened, maniac-eyed woman who came\namongst us? In truth she seemed scarcely human. Surely it is by reason of her\nevil power that disaster hath befallen us. Ah! she is a witch, or she is a\nsorceress, or mayhap a demon. . . . Without doubt she is the cause of all our\nwoes. . . . Would that we could find her--oh the evil destroyer! Oh the curse\nof our host! . . . Let us slay the murderess with clods and with stones, with\ncanes and with staves, or else with our fists. . . ." 1\n\nWhen the terrified and innocent Damayanti heard these fearsome threats, she\nfled away through the trees, lamenting her fate, and wailing: "Alas! alas! my\nterrible doom doth haunt me still. Misfortune dogs my foot-steps. . . . I have\nno memory of any sin of thought or deed--of any wrong done by me to living\nbeings. Perchance, oh, alas! I did sin in my former life, and am now suffering\ndue punishment. . . . For I suffer, indeed. I have lost my husband; my kingdom\nis lost; I have lost my kindred; my noble Nala has been taken from me, and I\nam far removed from my children, and I wander alone in the wood of serpents."\n\nWhen morning broke, the sorrowful queen met with some holy Brahmans who had\nescaped the night\'s disaster, and she went with them towards the city of\nChedi.\n\nThe people gazed with wonder on Damayanti when she walked though the streets\nwith her dust-smeared body and matted hair. The children danced about her as\nshe wandered about like to a maniac, so miserable and weary and emaciated.\n\np. 352\n\nIt chanced that the sorrowing woman came nigh to the royal palace. The mother\nof the king looked forth from a window, and beheld her and said: "Hasten, and\nbid this poor wanderer to enter. Although stricken and half-clothed she hath,\nmethinks, the beauty of Indra\'s long-eyed queen. Let her have refuge from\nthose staring men.\n\nDamayanti was then led before the queen mother, who spoke gently, saying:\n"Although bowed down with grief, thou art beautiful of form. Thou fearest not\nanyone. Who art thou so well protected by thine own chastity?"\n\nBhima\'s daughter wept, lamenting her fate, and related all that had befallen\nher, but did not reveal who she was. Then the queen mother said: "Dwell thou\nhere with me, and our servants shall go in quest of thy husband."\n\nDamayanti said: "O mother of heroes, if I abide here with thee I must eat not\nof food remnants, nor do menial service, nor can I hold converse with any man\nsave the holy Brahmans who promise to search for my husband."\n\nThe royal lady made answer: "As thou desireth, so let it be." Then she spake\nto Sunanda, her daughter, saying: "This lady will he to thee a handmaiden and\na friend. She is of thine own age and thy worthy peer. Be happy together."\n\nAt these words the Princess Sunanda was made glad, and she led the strange\nwoman unto her own abode, where sat all her virgin handmaidens.\n\nThere Damayanti dwelt for a time, waiting for her lost husband.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[340:1](iml26.htm#fr_304) The ceremony of purification included the sipping of\nwater and tie washing of feet.\n\n[342:1](iml26.htm#fr_305) Ayodhya signifies "invincible" city.
