Vyasa said :-- O king; The incarnation of Hari and the incarnation of the\nAmsa Avataras of all the other Devas are accountable to many causes. The chief\ncause being Karma; the minor causes being many.\n\n\n\np. 257\n\n\n\n2\\. Hear, now, the cause of the incarnations of Vasudeva (Kri _sn_ a's\nfather), Devaki and Rohini in detail.\n\n\n\n3\\. Once, on an occasion, S\xc2\x92riman Kas'yapa stole away the Kamadhenu (the\nheavenly Cow, yielding all desires) of the Deva Varu _n_ a for his sacrificial\npurpose; and though he was entreated by Varu _n_ a often and often to return\nthe cow, Kas'yapa did not return to him that, the best of all the cows.\n\n\n\n4\\. Varu _n_ a became very sorry; he went to Brahma, the Lord of the creation\nand told him humbly all that had happened and about his sorrows.\n\n\n\n5-6. \xc2\x93O Glorious One! Mahar _s_ i Kas'yapa is now almost infatuated with his\nsacrifice; and though I have tried all my means, he is not returning me my\ncow. I could not hear the pitiful cries and wailings of the calves or\nbereavement from their mother; and I cursed Kas'yapa saying \xc2\x91You would go down\nand take birth in the human world as a cow-herd; and your two wives also are\nto go there as human mortals, suffering under the greatest difficulties and\ndangers.\xc2\x92\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n7\\. O Brahma _n_ a! On seeing the distressed condition of the calves I cursed\nAditi a second time that she would be put to prison, her children would be\nstill born, and she would suffer lots of troubles.\n\n\n\n8\\. O Janamejaya! Hearing this, the Lotus-born Brahma called Kas'yapa before\nhim and asked.\n\n\n\n9\\. O Fortunate One! Why have you stolen away all the cows of the Varu _n_ a\nDeva, the Guardian of a quarter of the world? And why have you committed an\noffence in not returning the cows to Him?\n\n\n\n10\\. Bhagavan! You are intelligent, you know everything fully; knowing that it\nis a sin to steal other's property, why have you committed the unlawful act of\nstealing away the cows.\n\n\n\n11\\. Oh! What is the wonderful influence of covetousness! Even those that are\ngreat are not free from the clutches of greed. Covetousness is the source of\nall sins, is unapproved by the Sages and leads to hell.\n\n\n\n12\\. Lo! Mahar _s_ i Kas'yapa is not able to leave this vicious habit even\nnow; what shall I do? I will hence count greed as more powerful than even\nFate, the Ruler of all destinies.\n\n\n\n13\\. Blessed are those saints that have devoted themselves wholly to the\nattainment of peace, who are tranquil-hearted, lead a hermit life and don't\nask themselves of any thing from any body. Verily those are blessed.\n\n\n\np. 258\n\n\n\n14\\. This covetousness is a powerful enemy; it is always unholy and odious.\nSee! Its influence has overpowered the Mahar _s_ i Kas'yapa and has tied him\ndown to an ordinary affection and has urged him to commit a sinful act.\n\n\n\n15-16. Then the Prajapati Brahma, to preserve and keep the prestige in the\nname of Justice and Religion, cursed his own very dear grandson Kas'yapa, the\nbest of the Munis, and said :-- Go to the earth in your Ams'a, and take your\nbirth in the Yadu clan, be united with your wives and work as a Cowherd.\n\n\n\n17\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! Thus was cursed the Mahar _s_ i Kas'yapa by Brahma\nand Varu _n_ a to come down to the earth as Amsa Vatara to relieve the earth\nof her burden.\n\n\n\n18\\. Diti, too, becoming grieved much with sorrows, cursed Aditi that seven of\nher sons would be killed consecutively after their births.\n\n\n\n19\\. Janamejaya said :-- O best of Munis! Why was it that Diti so cruelly\ncursed his sister Aditi, the mother of Indra? Kindly explain to me the cause\nof this and oblige. I am sorry to hear of this curse.\n\n\n\n20\\. Suta said :-- Thus asked by the son of Parik _s_ it, Vyasa, the son of\nSatyabati, himself replied to the king about their causes in the following\nwords :--\n\n\n\n21\\. Vyasa said :-- Dak _s_ a Prajapati had two daughters, Diti and Aditi;\nthese two, of high rank, were married to Kas'yapa; and they were his\nfavourites.\n\n\n\n22\\. Aditi gave birth to the very powerful Indra, the king of the Devas. Diti,\ntoo, asked for a son of the same strength, prowess, and splendour as those of\nIndra.\n\n\n\n23\\. Diti, of beautiful dark blue eyes, entreated to her husband and said,\n\xc2\x93Give me a son, O giver of due respects to every body! who shall be a hero as\nstrong as Indra, religious and of indomitable energy.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n24\\. The Muni said to her :-- O Dear! Be peaceful; I advise you to take a vow,\npractise a rite, and when the period of your practice will be over, you will\nget a son like Indra.\n\n\n\n25\\. Diti promised to act according to his word and took an oath; and when she\npractised the vow, Mahar _s_ i Kas'yapa impregnated the seed in her womb. Diti\nalso bore the seed in her womb according to the usual rite.\n\n\n\n26\\. The excellent fair complexioned Diti remained sacred, observed all the\nrules and, deeply intent on her vow, subsisted only on milk and slept or the\nground.\n\n\n\np. 259\n\n\n\n27-28. Thus when the foetus was fully developed, Diti began to look white and\nfull of splendour. On seeing her thus, Aditi became anxious and thought if\nthere be born of Diti a son like the powerful Indra, then my son will no doubt\nbe deprived of his brilliancy and splendour.\n\n\n\n29\\. The proud Aditi, thinking thus, said to Indra :-- O Son! There, in the\nwomb of Diti, is your powerful enemy.\n\n\n\n30\\. O Beautiful One! Even now think out how you can kill your enemy. Before\nthe child is born of the womb, try to destroy\n\nit.\n\n\n\n31\\. Since the time I have looked, on my co-wife Diti, of beautiful eyes and\nproud, this is the one and only thought that troubles the peace in the\ninnermost of my hearts.\n\n\n\n32\\. The enemy, if he firmly gets hold like a fully developed consumption,\ncannot be killed; therefore the intelligent persons should destroy the\nenemies, when they are in their buds.\n\n\n\n33\\. O S\xc2\x92atakratu! My heart is being pierced wholly by an iron spoke when I\nsee the womb of Diti; kill it by any means you can!\n\n\n\n34\\. O High minded One! If you like my welfare, then destroy the foetus, in\nthe womb of Diti, by any of the existent means, Sama, Dana or strength and\nthus remove the cause of grief in my heart.\n\n\n\n35\\. Vyasa said :-- On hearing his mother, Indra, the King of the Immortals,\nthought over all the means and went then to his step-mother Diti.\n\n\n\n36\\. That evil minded Indra bowed down at the foot of Diti with humility and\naddressed her with words, sweet but full of poison.\n\n\n\n37\\. O mother! You have become very weak, lean and thin in the practise your\nvow. I have come to serve you; order me now what I can do for you.\n\n\n\n38\\. O chaste one to your husband! I want to shampoo your feet. To serve one's\nGuru means to earn righteousness and immortality.\n\n\n\n39\\. O mother! I swear, on oath, I don't make any difference between you and\nmy mother Aditi. Saying thus, he touched her feet and began to shampoo her\nlegs.\n\n\n\n40\\. The beautiful eyed Diti, tired of the vow, lean and thin, thus being\nshampooed and having full faith in Indra's words, fell to deep sleep.\n\n\n\n41-42. Seeing her asleep, Indra, with thunderbolt in his hand, took subtle\nform and by the influence of his yogic power, entered carefully into her womb\nquickly and cut asunder the foetus in the womb into seven parts.\n\n\n\np. 260\n\n\n\n43-44. The child in the womb, struck by the thunder bolt, cried out. Indra\nspoke to the child gently :-- \xc2\x93Do not cry,\xc2\x94 and in the mean while cut each of\nthe seven parts into seven parts again. Thus, O king! The forty-nine Maruts\nwere born.\n\n\n\n45\\. When the good natured Diti awoke, she came to know that Indra has\ntreacherously cut the foetus in her womb and became very sorry and angry.\n\n\n\n46-47. Knowing that all these treacherous acts are really done under the\nadvice of her sister, the truthful Diti; who was under the vow, cursed Aditi,\nand Indra, saying that as her son Indra has treacherously cut the foetus in\nher womb, Indra's kingdom over the three worlds would be destroyed.\n\n\n\n48-49. And as the sinful Aditi has secretly caused the destruction of my son,\nher sons, too, would also die after their birth consecutively and she would\ndwell in the prison house in much trouble and anxiety and would also bear\nstill born sons in her next birth.\n\n\n\n50\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! Mahar _s_ i Kas'yapa, the son of Marichi, hearing\nthe curse, allayed her anger with loving words.\n\n\n\n51\\. O Blessed One! Do not be angry. Your sons would all become very powerful\nand would be called Maruts. They would be companions and friends to Indra.\n\n\n\n52\\. O Dear! Your curse won't be fruitless; in the 28th Manvantara, at the end\nof the Dvapara Yuga, your curse will bear fruit. Then Aditi, sinful for her\njealousy and anger, will go down on earth to take the human birth through her\nAmsa (part) and suffer according to your curse.\n\n\n\n53\\. Varu _n_ a, too, had become very grieved and cursed her. And, due to both\nthese curses, this Aditi will be born as a woman.\n\n\n\n54\\. O King! The fair complexioned Diti, thus consoled by her husband, became\nglad and did not utter any more unpleasant words.\n\n\n\n55\\. O king! Thus I have narrated to you the cause of the previous curse. O\nbest of kings! Thus Aditi was born as Devaki out of her Ams'a.\n\n\n\nHere ends the third Chapter of the Fourth Book of the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri\nMad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses on the former curse of Vasudeva and\nDevaki by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 4](bk04ch04.htm)\n\n"
