S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Muni! Dharmadhvaja and Kus\xc2\x92adhvaja\npractised severe tapasyas and worshipped Lak _s_ mi. They then got separately\ntheir desired boons. By the boon of Maha Lak _s_ mi, they\n\n\n\np. 867\n\n\n\nbecame again the rulers of the earth. They acquired great religious merits and\nthey also had their children. The wife of Kus\xc2\x92adhvaja was named Malavati.\nAfter a long time, the chaste wife delivered one daughter, born of the parts\nof Kamala. The daughter, on being born, became full of wisdom. On being born,\nthe baby began to sing clearly the Vedic mantrams from the lying-in-chamber.\nTherefore She was named Vedavati by the Pundits. She bathed after her birth\nand became ready to go to the forest to practise severe tapas. Everyone then,\ntried earnestly to dissuade her, devoted to Naraya _n_ a, from the enterprise.\nBut she did not listen to anybody. She went to Pu _s_ kara and practised hard\ntapasya for one Manvantara. Yet her body did not get lean a bit; rather she\ngrew more plumpy and fatter. By degrees her youth began to show signs in her\nbody; one day she heard an incorporeal voice from the air above, \xc2\x93O Fair One!\nIn your next birth S\xc2\x92ri Hari, adored by Brahma and other gods, will be your\nhusband.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, her joy knew no bounds. She went to the solitary caves\nin the Gandhamadan mountain to practise tapas again. When a long time passed\naway in this tapasya, one day the irresistible Ravana came there as guest. No\nsooner Vedavati saw the guest, then she gave him, out of devotion to the\nguest, water to wash feet, delicious fruits, and cool water for his drink. The\nvillain accept the hospitality and sitting there, began to ask :-- \xc2\x93O\nAuspicious One! Who are you?\xc2\x94 Seeing the fair smiling lady, with beautiful\nteeth, her face blooming like the autumnal lotus, of heavy loins, and of full\nbreast, that villain became passionate. He lost entirely all consciousness and\nbecame ready to make violence on Her. Seeing this, the chaste Vedavati, became\nangry and out of her tapas influence, astounded him and made him insensible to\nmove. He remained motionless like an inanimate body. He could not move his\nhands nor feet nor could he speak. That wicked fellow then mentally recited\npraises to her. And the praise of the Higher S\xc2\x92akti can never go futile. She\nbecame pleased and granted him religious merits in the next world. But she\nalso pronounced this curse :-- \xc2\x93That when you have touch my body out of\npassion, then you will be ruined with your whole family for my sake. Now see\nmy power.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Thus saying to Ravana, Vedavati left her body by her\nyogic power. Then Ravana took her body and delivered it to the Ganges and he\nthen returned to his own home. But Ravana thought over the matter repeatedly\nand exclaimed, \xc2\x93What wonder have I seen! Oh! What a miracle this lady has\nwrought!\xc2\x94 Ravana thus lamented. This Vedavati, of pure character, took her\nbirth afterwards as Sita, the daughter of\n\n\n\np. 868\n\n\n\nJanaka. For the sake of this Sita, Ravana was ruined with his whole family. By\nthe religious merits of her previous birth, the ascetic lady got Bhagavan Hari\nS\xc2\x92ri Rama Chandra, the Fullest of the Full, for her husband and remained for a\nlong time in great enjoyment with the Lord of the world; a thing very\ndifficult to be attained! Though she was a Jatismara (one who knows all about\nher past lives), she did not feel any pain due to her practising severe\nausterities in her previous birth; for when the pains end in success, the\npains are not then felt at all. Sita, in Her fresh youth enjoyed various\npleasures in the company of her husband, handsome, peaceful, humorous and\nwitty, the chief of the Devas, loved by the female sex, well-qualified, and\njust what she desired. But the all-powerful Time is irresistible; the truthful\nRamachandra, the scion of the Raghu\xc2\x92s family, had to keep up the promise made\nby his father and so he had to go to the forest, ordained by Time. He remained\nwith Sita and Lak _s_ ma _n_ a near the sea. Once the God Fire appeared to Him\nin the form of a Brahma _n_ a. Fire, in a Brahmin-form, saw Rama Chandra\nmorose and became himself mortified. Then the Truthful Fire addressed the\ntruthful Ramachandra :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan Ramachandra! I now speak to you how time\nis now coming to you. Now has come the time when your Sita will be stolen.\n\n\n\n31-48. The course of Destiny is irresistible; none else is more powerful than\nTime, Fate. So give over your Sita, the World Mother to me and keep with you\nthis Chhaya Sita (the shadow Sita; the false Sita). When the time of Sita\xc2\x92s\nordeal by fire will take place I will give Her back to you. The Devas united\nhave sent me to you. I am not really a Brahmi _n_ ; but I am Ag _n_ i Deva\n(eater of oblations).\xc2\x94 Ramachandra heard Fire and gave his assent. But his\nheart shattered. He did not speak of this to Lak _s_ ma _n_ a. By the yogic\npower Ag _n_ i (Fire) created a Maya Sita. This Maya Sita, O Narada, was\nperfectly equal to the real Sita. Fire, then, handed this Maya Sita to the\nhands of Ramachandra. Hutasana (fire) took the real Sita and said, \xc2\x93Never\ndivulge this to any other body\xc2\x94 and went away. What to speak of divulging the\nsecret to any other body, Lak _s_ ma _n_ a even could not know it. By this\ntime Rama saw one deer, made of all gold. To bring that deer carefully to her,\nSita sent Ramachandra with great eagerness. Putting Sita under Lak _s_ ma _n_\na\xc2\x92s care, in that forest, Rama went himself immediately and pierced the deer\nby one arrow. That Maya mriga (the deer created by magic powers) on being\npierced, cried out \xc2\x93Ha Lak _s_ ma _n_ a!\xc2\x94 and seeing Hari before him and\nremembering the name of Hari, quitted\n\n\n\np. 869\n\n\n\nhis life. The deer body then vanished; and a divine body made its appearance\nin its stead. This new body mounting on an aerial car made of jewels, ascended\nto Vaiku _nt_ ha. That Mayik (magic) deer was in its previous birth, a\nservant, of the two gate-keepers of Vaiku _nt_ ha; but, for the sake of some\nemergency, he had to take up this Rakh _s_ asa birth. He again became the\nservant of two door-keepers of Vaiku _nt_ ha. On the other hand Sita Devi,\nhearing the cry \xc2\x93Ha Laksmana!\xc2\x94 became very distressed and sent Lak _s_ ma _n_\na in search of Rama. No sooner did Lak _s_ ma _n_ a get out of the hermitage,\nthe irresistible Rava _n_ a took away Sita gladly to the city of Lanka\n(Ceylon). Now Ramachandra, seeing Lak _s_ ma _n_ a on the way in the forest,\nbecame merged in the ocean of sorrows and without losing any time came\nhurriedly to the hermitage where he could not find Sita. Instantly he fell\nunconscious, on the ground; and, after a long time, when he regained his\nconsciousness, he lamented and wandered here and there in search of Her. After\nsome days on the banks of the river Godavari, getting the information of Sita,\nhe built a bridge across the ocean with the help of His monkey armies. Then he\nentered with his army into Lanka and slew Rava _n_ a with arrows with all his\nfriends. When Sita\xc2\x92s ordeal by fire came, Ag _n_ i (Fire) handed over the real\nSita to Ramachandra. The Shadow Sita then humbly addressed Ag _n_ i and Rama\nChandra, \xc2\x93O Lord! What am I to do now? Settle my case.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n49-53. Ag _n_ i and Ramachandra both of them then said to Chhaya Sita :-- \xc2\x93O\nDevi! Go to Pu _s_ kara and practise tapasya there; that place is the giver of\nreligious merits and then you will be the Svarga Lak _s_ mi (Lak _s_ mi of\nHeaven).\xc2\x94 Hearing this, the Chhaya Sita went and practised tapasya for the\nthree divine lakh years and became Maha Lak _s_ mi. This Svarga Lak _s_ mi\nappeared at one time from the sacrificial Ku _nd_ a (pit). She was known as\nthe daughter of Drupada and became the wife of the five Pa _nd_ avas. She was\nVeda Vati, the daughter of Kus\xc2\x92adhvaja in the Satya Yuga; Sita, the wife of\nRama and the daughter of Janaka in Treta Yuga; and Draupadi, the daughter of\nDrupada, in the Dvapara Yuga. As she existed in the Satya, Treta, and Dvapara\nYugas, the Three Yugas, hence She is Trihayani.\n\n\n\n54\\. Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Chief of Munis! O Remover of doubts! Why had Draupadi\nfive husbands? A great doubt has arisen in my mind on this point. Remove my\ndoubt.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n55-63. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Devar _s_ i! When, in the city of Lanka, the\nreal Sita came before Rama, then Chhaya Sita, full of youth and beauty, became\nvery anxious. Ag _n_ i Deva and Ramachandra both told\n\n\n\np. 870\n\n\n\nHer to go to Pu _s_ kara and worship S\xc2\x92amkara. While this Chhaya Sita was\npractising austerities in Pu _s_ kara, She became very anxious to get a good\nhusband and asked from MahaDeva the boon \xc2\x93Grant me a husband\xc2\x94 and repeated it\nfive times. S\xc2\x92iva, the chief among the humorous, witty persons, hearing this,\nsaid, \xc2\x93O Dear! You will get five husbands\xc2\x94 and thus granted her the boon.\nTherefore She became the dearest wife of the five Pa _nd_ avas. Now hear other\nfacts. When the war at Lanka was over, S\xc2\x92ri Ramachandra got his own dear wife\nSita, and installing Vibhisana on the throne of Lanka, returned to Ayodhya. He\nruled for eleven thousand years in Bharata and finally went to Vaiku _nt_ ha\nwith his all his subjects. Vedavati, the incarnation in part of Lak _s_ mi\ndissolved in the body of Kamala. Thus I have described to you the pure\nanecdote of Vedavati. Hearing this destroys sins and increases virtue. The\nfour Vedas reigned incarnate, in their true forms, on the lips of Vedavati;\nhence She was named Vedavati. Thus I have told you the anecdote of the\ndaughter of Kus\xc2\x92adhvaja. Now hear the story of Tulasi, the daughter of\nDharmadhvaja.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixteenth Chapter in the Ninth Book on the incarnation of Maha\nLak _s_ mi in the house of Kus\xc2\x92adhvaja in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 17](bk09ch17.htm)\n\n'
