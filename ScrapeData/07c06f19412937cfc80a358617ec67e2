Nature desires objects which are liked; nature hates all (objects) which\nare hateful 6. Desire and hatred are born from nature 7as the upward and\n\np. 289\n\ndownward life-winds, after attaining to the bodies of living creatures. Apart\nfrom them, and as the constant entity underlying them, I see the individual\nself in the body. Dwelling in that (self), I am in no wise attached 1 (to\nanything) through desire or anger, or old age, or death. Not desiring any\nobject of desire, not hating any evil, there is no taint on my natures 2, as\nthere is no (taint) of a drop of water on lotuses 3. They are inconstant\nthings appertaining to this constant (principle) which looks on various\nnatures. Although actions are performed, the net of enjoyments does not attach\nitself to it, as the net of the sun's rays does not attach itself to the sky\n4. On this 5, too, they relate an ancient story, (in the shape of) a dialogue\nbetween an Adhvaryu priest and an ascetic. Understand that, O glorious one!\nSeeing an animal being sprinkled 6 at a sacrificial ceremony, an ascetic who\nwas sitting (there) spoke to the Adhvaryu, censuring (the act) as destruction\nof life. The Adhvaryu\n\np. 290\n\nanswered him (saying), this goat will not be destroyed. (This) creature will\nobtain welfare, since the Vedic text is such. For that part of him which is of\nthe earth will go to the earth; whatever in him is produced from water, that\nwill enter water. His eye (will enter) the sun, (his) ear the quarters, and\nhis life-winds likewise the sky 1. There is no offence on my part, adhering\n(as I do) to the scriptures 2.\n\nThe Ascetic said:\n\nIf you perceive (that) good (will) result upon his life being severed (from\nhim), then the sacrifice is for the goat, what benefit (is it) to you? Let the\nbrother, father, mother, and friend (of the goat) give you their consent 3;\ntake him (to them) and consult (them), especially as he is dependent. You\nought to inquire of those who can give their consent thus. After hearing their\nconsent, (the matter) will be fit for consideration 4. The life-winds 5, too,\nof this goat have gone to their sources, and I think only his unmoving body\nremains. To those who wish to derive enjoyment from the slaughter (of a living\ncreature), the unconscious body being comparable to fuel, that which is called\nan animal becomes\n\np. 291\n\nthe fuel 1. The teaching of the elders 2 is, that refraining from slaughter\n(of living creatures) is (the duty) among all duties. We maintain that that\naction should be performed which involves no slaughter. (Our) proposition is\nno slaughter (of living creatures). If I spoke further, it would be possible\nto find fault with your proceedings in many ways 3. Always refraining from the\nslaughter of all beings is what we approve. We substantiate (this) from what\nis actually visible 4, we do not rely on what is not visible.\n\nThe Adhvaryu said:\n\nYou enjoy the earth's quality of fragrance, you drink watery juices, you see\nthe colours of shining bodies, you touch the qualities of the air, you hear\nthe sound produced in space, you think by the mind (on the objects of) mental\noperations. And all these entities, you believe, have life. You have not\n(then) abstained from taking life. You are (engaged) in the slaughter (of\nliving creatures) 5. There is no movement 6 without slaughter (of living\ncreatures). Or what do you think, O twice-born one?\n\np. 292\n\nThe Ascetic said\n\nThe indestructible and the destructible, such is the double manifestation of\nthe self. Of these the indestructible is the existent 1, the manifestation as\nan individual 2 (entity) is called the destructible 3. The life-winds, the\ntongue, the mind, and (the quality of) goodness, together with (the quality\nof) passion 4, (these make up) the manifestations as individual entities. And\nto one who is free from these manifestations, who is free from the pairs of\nopposites, who is devoid of expectations, who is alike to all beings, who is\nfree from (the thought that this or that is) mine, who has subdued his self,\nand who is released on all hands 5, there is no fear anywhere 6.\n\nThe Adhvaryu said:\n\nO best of talented men! one should in this (world)\n\np. 293\n\ndwell in company of good men only [1](sbe0841.htm#fn_1417). For having heard\nyour opinion, my mind is enlightened. O venerable sir! I approach you, in the\nbelief (that you are) the Lord; and I say (to you), O twice-born one! there is\nno fault (attaching) to me, performing (as I have done) the rites performed by\nothers [2](sbe0841.htm#fn_1418).\n\nThe Brahma _n_ a said:\n\nWith this explanation, the ascetic thereafter remained silent, and the\nAdhvaryu also proceeded with the great sacrifice, freed from delusion. Thus\nBrahma _n_ as understand the very subtle emancipation to be of this nature,\nand understanding it, they act (accordingly), being directed by the Kshetra\n_g_ \xc3\xb1a.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[288:1](sbe0839.htm#fr_1392) Literally, 'lean.'\n\n[288:2](sbe0839.htm#fr_1393) I. e. the body in the soul, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[288:3](sbe0839.htm#fr_1394) Knowledge is Brahman, which is described as a\nforest here, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[288:4](sbe0839.htm#fr_1395) Cf. Gita, [p. 70](sbe0808.htm#page_70).\n\n[288:5](sbe0840.htm#fr_1396) This is the name for the operations of the mind.\n\n[288:6](sbe0840.htm#fr_1397) The sense is similar to that at Gita, [p.\n55](sbe0805.htm#page_55). The self has nothing to do with these feelings; the\nqualities deal with the qualities.\n\n[288:7](sbe0840.htm#fr_1398) Cf. Gita, [p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65). The\nmeaning of nature here, as in the Gita, is in substance the result of all\nprevious action with which the self has been associated, which result, of\ncourse, exists connected not with the self, but with the developments of\nnature, in the form of body, p. 289 senses, &c. The comparison appears to mean\nthat the feelings of desire &c. are, like the life--winds, unconnected with\nthe self, though associated with it, and are both alike manifestations of\nnature.\n\n[289:1](sbe0840.htm#fr_1399) Nilaka _nth_ a compares B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka,\np. 770. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra has a different reading, meaning 'liable (to be\nsubjugated).'\n\n[289:2](sbe0840.htm#fr_1400) The plural. which is in the original, is unusual.\nThe various aspects of the 'result' stated in [p. 288](sbe0839.htm#page_288),\nnote  7, being looked at separately, are described as 'natures,' like the\nleaves of a lotus, which in their ensemble make one lotus.\n\n[289:3](sbe0840.htm#fr_1401) Lalita Vistara, p. 2, and [p.\n64](sbe0807.htm#page_64) supra.\n\n[289:4](sbe0840.htm#fr_1402) The figure seems to be somewhat like that at\nGita, [p. 82](sbe0811.htm#page_82), about the atmosphere and space, which\nlatter remains untainted by the former. Looking on various natures, i. e. as\ndistinct from the self.\n\n[289:5](sbe0840.htm#fr_1403) Viz. the remaining untainted.\n\n[289:6](sbe0840.htm#fr_1404) I. e. with water, preparatory to its being\noffered up for the sacrifice.\n\n[290:1](sbe0840.htm#fr_1405) Cf. B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 542, and [p.\n337](sbe0854.htm#page_337) below.\n\n[290:2](sbe0840.htm#fr_1406) Cf. _Kh_ andogya-upanishad, p. 627, and also _S_\nariraka Bhashya on Sutra III, 1, 25, p. 774.\n\n[290:3](sbe0840.htm#fr_1407) I. e. for his slaughter, which is to bring\nwelfare to the goat. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says that this is a sort of reductio\nad absurdum, as the sacrifice is in truth not in the interests of the goat at\nall.\n\n[290:4](sbe0840.htm#fr_1408) Viz. whether the goat should be killed. Without\ntheir consent he ought not to be slaughtered; with their consent, it becomes a\nmatter for consideration, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[290:5](sbe0840.htm#fr_1409) It may also mean the senses, as in the _Kh_\nandogya, p. 297.\n\n[291:1](sbe0840.htm#fr_1410) This is not very clear, but the meaning seems to\nbe that the slaughter is committed for the enjoyment of the sacrificer; the\nsacrificer only requires fuel, and the slaughtered animal is then used for\nthat purpose.\n\n[291:2](sbe0840.htm#fr_1411) Cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 627, and next note; and\nGita, inter alia, [p. 114](sbe0817.htm#page_114), and [p.\n348](sbe0855.htm#page_348) infra.\n\n[291:3](sbe0840.htm#fr_1412) See Sa _n_ khyatattvaktumudi, p. 7.\n\n[291:4](sbe0840.htm#fr_1413) I. e. a rule expressly laid down. What is not\nvisible means what is not expressly stated, but is to be derived by inference,\nand so forth (cf. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 4, 8). The express text is the famous one,\n'Na himsyatsarva bhutani.' Hi _m_ sa, which is rendered slaughter here, may\nmean also 'giving pain' generally.\n\n[291:5](sbe0840.htm#fr_1414) This is the tu quoque argument. The sustentation\nof life requires some sort of slaughter.\n\n[291:6](sbe0840.htm#fr_1415) I. e. the support of the body, says Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra.\n\n[292:1](sbe0840.htm#fr_1416) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra takes it otherwise, 'the\ntrue nature of the Sat, the self.' Nilaka _nth_ a renders the original by\nsadrupam without further explanation. This indestructible seems to correspond\nto that mentioned at Gita, [p. 113](sbe0817.htm#page_113), which should be\nconsidered in connection with Gita, pp. [73](sbe0808.htm#page_73),\n[74](sbe0809.htm#page_74). The note at the former page is, perhaps, not quite\naccurately expressed, as the word 'material cause' conveys some inadmissible\nassociations. Perhaps 'underlying principle' might be a nearer approach to the\ncorrect idea. The existent will thus be that which really exists, as it is\nindestructible.\n\n[292:2](sbe0840.htm#fr_1417) Cf. Gita, [p. 77](sbe0809.htm#page_77).\n\n[292:3](sbe0840.htm#fr_1418) See _S_ anti Parvan (Moksha), ch. 240, st. 31.\n\n[292:4](sbe0840.htm#fr_1419) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, 'The life-winds here\nare indicative of the operations of the organs of action (as to which see p.\n290, note  5 supra), the tongue of the perceptive senses, the mind of the\ninternal activities, the quality of goodness of all sources of pleasure, and\npassion of all sources of pain,' the last two apparently covering the external\nworld, the previous ones the human activities, internal and external.\n\n[292:5](sbe0840.htm#fr_1420) Released scil. from piety or impiety, &c.,--Ar\n_g_ una Mi _s_ ra, who says 'Self' in the phrase preceding means mind.\n\n[292:6](sbe0840.htm#fr_1421) Because, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, according to\nthe very authority which says there is sin in slaughter, all sin is destroyed\nby knowledge. Cf. Gita, [p. 64](sbe0807.htm#page_64).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIV](sbe0841.htm)\n\n"
