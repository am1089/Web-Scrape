(A householder) shall approach (his wife) in the proper season, 1\n\n2\\. Or (he may do so) at any time except on the forbidden (days). 2\n\np. 201\n\n3\\. He shall worship gods, manes, men, goblins, (and) _Ri_ shis. 3\n\n4\\. Every day he shall recite privately (a portion of the Veda), 4\n\n5\\. And the (daily) libation of water to the manes (is obligatory on him). 5\n\n6\\. Other (rites than these he may perform) according, to his ability. 6\n\n7\\. The (sacred) fire (must be kindled) on his marriage or on the division of\nthe family estate. 7\n\n8\\. The domestic (ceremonies must be performed) with (the aid of) that (fire).\n8\n\n9\\. (Also) the sacrifices to the gods, manes, (and) men? and the private\nrecitation (and) the Bali-offerings. 9\n\np. 202\n\n10\\. The oblations (which are thrown) into the (sacred) fire (at the Vai _s_\nvadeva-sacrifice are offered) to Agni, to Dhanvantari, to all the gods, to Pra\n_g_ apati, (and to Agni) Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t; 10\n\n11\\. And (Bali-offerings must be given) to the deities presiding over the\n(eight) points of the horizon, in their respective places, 11\n\n12\\. At the doors (of the house) to the Maruts, 12\n\n13\\. To the deities of the dwelling inside (the house), 13\n\np. 203\n\n14\\. To Brahman in the centre (of the house), 14\n\n15\\. To the Waters near the water-pot,\n\n16\\. To the Ether in the air, 16\n\n17\\. And to the Beings walking about at night in the evening. 17\n\n18\\. A gift of food shall be preceded by a libation of water and (it shall be\npresented) after (the recipient) has been made to say, \'May welfare attend\nthee,\' 18\n\n19\\. And the same (rule applies) to all gifts presented for the sake of\nspiritual merit.\n\n20\\. The reward of a gift (offered) to a person who is not a Brahma _n_ a is\nequal (to the value of the gift), those (of presents given) to a Brahma _n_ a\ntwofold, to a _S_ rotriya thousandfold, to one who knows the whole Veda\n(vedaparaga) endless. 20\n\n21\\. Presents of money (must be given) outside the Vedi to persons begging for\ntheir Gurus, (or) in order to defray the expenses of their wedding, (or 21\n\np. 204\n\nto procure) medicine for the sick, to those who are without means of\nsubsistence, to those who are going to offer a sacrifice, to those engaged in\nstudy, to travellers, (and) to those who have performed the Vi _s_ va _g_ it-\nsacrifice.\n\n22\\. Prepared food (must be given) to other beggars. 22\n\n23\\. For an unlawful purpose he shall not give (anything), though he may have\npromised it. 23\n\n24\\. An untruth spoken by people under the influence of anger, excessive fear,\npain (or) greed, by infants, very old men, persons labouring under a delusion,\nthose being under the influence of drink (or) by mad men does not cause (the\nspeaker) to fall. 24\n\n25\\. Before (a householder eats) he shall feed his guests, the infants, the\nsick people, the pregnant women, the females under his protection, the very\naged men, and those of low condition (who may be in his house). 25\n\np. 205\n\n26\\. But (when) his teacher, parents (or intimate) friends (visit his house),\nhe shall proceed to the preparation of the dinner after asking them (for\norders). 26\n\n27\\. When an officiating priest, his teacher, his father-in-law, paternal or\nmaternal uncles visit (him), a Madhuparka (or honey-mixture must be offered to\nthem). 27\n\n8\\. (If they have been once honoured in this manner, the ceremony need be)\nrepeated (only) after a year.\n\n29\\. (But) on (the occasion of) a sacrifice and of the wedding (a Madhuparka\nmust be offered, though) less than a year (has passed since the last visit of\nthe persons thus honoured).\n\n30\\. And to a king) who is a _S_ rotriya (a Madhuparka must be offered as\noften as he comes), 30\n\n31\\. (But to a king) who is not a _S_ rotriya a seat and water. 31\n\n32\\. But for a _S_ rotriya he shall cause to be prepared a foot-bath, an\nArghya, and food of a superior quality. 32\n\np. 206\n\n33\\. Or his usual food distinguished by a (particularly careful) preparation.\n33\n\n34\\. To a (Brahma _n_ a) who is not learned in the Vedas, (but) of good\nconduct, food of a middling (quality) shall be given, 34\n\n35\\. To one who is the reverse (of virtuous) grass, water, and earth,\n\n36\\. (Or) at least a welcome. 36\n\n37\\. Honour (must be shown to a guest, and the host must) not dine better\n(than his guest). 37\n\n38\\. A couch, a seat, (and) a lodging (of the) same (quality as the host uses\nmust be given) to (a guest) of equal condition and to one\'s betters; they must\nbe accompanied (on departure) and respectfully attended to (during their\nstay). 38\n\n39\\. (The host shall show similar) though less (attention) to (a guest) who is\ninferior (to himself). 39\n\np. 207\n\n40\\. He is called a guest who, belonging to a different village (and)\nintending to stay for one night only, arrives when the sun\'s beams pass over\nthe trees. 40\n\n41\\. According (to his caste a guest) must be asked about his well-being (ku\n_s_ ala), about his being free from hurt (anamaya), or about his health\n(arogya). 41\n\n42\\. The last (formula must also be used in addressing a _S_ udra.\n\n43\\. A man of a lower caste (is) not (to be considered) a guest by a Brahma\n_n_ a, except if he has approached on (the occasion of) a sacrifice. 43\n\n44\\. But a Kshatriya must be fed after the Brahma _n_ a (guests).\n\n45\\. (Men of) other (castes he shall feed) with his servants for mercy\'s sake.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[200:1](sbe0269.htm#fr_940) **V**. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 1, 1, 17.\n\n[200:2](sbe0269.htm#fr_941) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 1, 1, 18.\n\n[201:3](sbe0269.htm#fr_942) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 4, 12, 15; I, 4, 13, 1; Manu III,\n69-72; IV, 29, 21; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 99, 102-104.\n\n[201:4](sbe0269.htm#fr_943) Manu III, 81; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 104.\n\n[201:5](sbe0269.htm#fr_944) Manu III, 82 Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 104. \'The word "and"\nindicates that water must be offered to the gods and _Ri_ shis also.\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[201:6](sbe0269.htm#fr_945) \'(Rites) other than those prescribed in Sutras 3-5\nhe may perform according to his energy, i.e. according to his ability. But\nthose he should zealously perform. As the oblations to the gods and the other\n(Mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as) are mentioned before the kindling of the domestic fire,\nthey must be performed by a person who has not yet kindled the domestic fire\nwith the aid of the common (kitchen) fire.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[201:7](sbe0269.htm#fr_946) As long as the family remains united, its head\noffers the oblations for all its members.\n\n[201:8](sbe0269.htm#fr_947) \'The domestic rites, i.e. the Pu _m_ savana and\nthe rest. . . . Now with the aid of which fire must a man, who has not yet\nkindled the domestic fire, perform the Pu _m_ savana, &c.? Some answer that he\nshall use a common fire. But the opinion of the teacher (Gautama) is that he\nshall use the sacred fire which has been kindled on that occasion.\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[201:9](sbe0269.htm#fr_948) Haradatta states that the Mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as are\nagain enumerated in order to show that a person who has kindled the sacred\nfire shall use this for them, not a common fire. He also states that a passage\nof U _s_ anas, according to which some teachers prescribe the performance of\nthe daily recitation near the sacred fire, shows that this rite too has a\nconnection with the sacred fire.\n\n[202:10](sbe0269.htm#fr_949) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 3, 16, where, however, as in all\nother works, the order of the offerings differs. Haradatta adds that the word\n\'oblations\' is used in the Sutra in order to indicate that the word svaha must\nbe pronounced at the end of each Mantra, and that the expression \'in the fire\'\nindicates that the Bali-offerings described in the following Sutra must be\nthrown on the ground.\n\n[202:11](sbe0269.htm#fr_950) Compare \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 3, 20-II, 2, 4, 8; Manu\nIII, 87-90, where, as elsewhere, the order of the offerings differs. According\nto Haradatta the deities intended are, Indra, Agni, Yama, Nir _ri_ ti, Varu\n_n_ a, Vayu, Soma, and \xc3\x8e _s_ ana. The first offering must be placed to the\neast, the next to the south-east, south, &c.\n\n[202:12](sbe0269.htm#fr_951) At all the doors, as many as there are, a Bali\nmust be offered with the Mantra, \'To the Maruts, svaha.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[202:13](sbe0269.htm#fr_952) \'As he says "inside" (pravi _s_ ya, literally\n"entering") he must stand outside while offering the Balis at the doors. At\nthis occasion some require the following Mantra, "To the deities of the\ndwelling, svaha," because that is found in the \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana (G _ri_ hya-\nsutra I, 2, 4). Others consider it necessary to mention the deities by name,\nand to present as many offerings as there are deities, while pronouncing the\nrequired words.\'--Haradatta. The commentator then goes on to quote a passage\nfrom U _s_ anas, which he considers applicable, because it contains the names\nof the G _ri_ hadevatas. I doubt, however, if the \'others\' are right, and\nstill more if, in case they should be right, it would be advisable to supply\nthe names of the G _ri_ hadevatas from U _s_ anas.\n\n[203:14](sbe0269.htm#fr_953) \'Because the word "and" occurs in Sutra 11 after\nthe word "to the deities presiding over the points of the horizon" a Bali-\noffering must be presented to the deities mentioned by the author in Sutra 10,\nviz. to the earth, wind, Pra _g_ apati, and to all the gods, after a Bali has\nbeen offered to Brahman.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[203:16](sbe0269.htm#fr_954) \'The Bali presented to \xc3\x82ka _s_ a, "the ether,"\nmust be thrown up into the air, as Manu says, III, 90.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[203:17](sbe0269.htm#fr_955) \'Because of the word "and," he must, also,\npresent Balis to the deities mentioned above.\'--Haradatta. The commentator\nmeans to say that in the evening not only the \'Beings walking about at night\'\n(nakta _m_ _k_ ara) are to receive a portion, but all the other deities too,\nand that the Balikarma must be offered twice a day.\n\n[203:18](sbe0269.htm#fr_956)-19. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 4, 9, 8.\n\n[203:20](sbe0269.htm#fr_957) According to Haradatta the term _S_ rotriya here\ndenotes one who has studied one Veda, (but see also \xc3\x82pastamba II, 3, 6, 4; II,\n4, 8, 5.) Vedaparaga is a man who has studied one Veda, together with the\nA\xe1\xb9\x85gas, Kalpa-sutras, and Upanishads.\n\n[203:21](sbe0269.htm#fr_958) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 10, 1-2. \'Now he promulgates a\nSutra which refers to those cases where one must necessarily make gifts, and\nwhere one incurs guilt by a refusal. . . . As the expression "outside the\nVedi" is used, presents must be given to others also "inside the Vedi" (i.e.\nfees to priests, &c.)\'--Haradatta.\n\n[204:22](sbe0269.htm#fr_959) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 4, 14.\n\n[204:23](sbe0269.htm#fr_960) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 10, 3; Colebrooke II, Digest IV,\n47; Mayukha IX, 5. \'As he says "for an unlawful purpose," what has been\npromised must in other cases necessarily be given.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[204:24](sbe0269.htm#fr_961) Colebrooke II, Digest IV, 56. \'"Does not cause\n(the speaker) to fall," i.e. produces no guilt. Hence such persons need not\neven give a promised present.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[204:25](sbe0269.htm#fr_962) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 4, 11-13; II, 4, 9, 10; Manu\nIII, 116. \'Females under his protection (suvasinya _h_ ), i.e. daughters and\nsisters those of low condition ( _g_ aghanya _h_ ), i.e. servants, slaves, and\nthe like . . . . . The term "men of low condition" is made a separate word in\nthe text in order to show that they come after the others.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[205:26](sbe0269.htm#fr_963) Manu III, 113.\n\n[205:27](sbe0269.htm#fr_964) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 4, 8, 5-9.\n\n[205:30](sbe0269.htm#fr_965) \'And to a king a Madhuparka must be offered on\nhis arrival. If he is a _S_ rotriya (this must be done) on each visit.\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[205:31](sbe0269.htm#fr_966) \'A king who is not a _S_ rotriya shall be\nhonoured with a seat and water, not with a Madhuparka.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[205:32](sbe0269.htm#fr_967) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 3, 6, 7-10, 14-15. \'This Sutra may\nbe optionally taken as referring to a Brahma _n_ a, because the word _S_\nrotriya is repeated. For a _S_ rotriya who has come as a guest, a foot-bath,\ni.e. water for washing the feet, an Arghya, i.e. water mixed with Durva grass,\nflowers, &c., and food of a superior quality, i.e. milk and rice; cakes and\nthe like shall be particularly prepared, if the host is able to afford it.\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[206:33](sbe0269.htm#fr_968) \'But if (the host is) not able (to afford\ndainties), he shall prepare that same food which is daily used in his house,\ndistinguished in the preparation, i.e. by adding pepper and the like\ncondiments, by frying it, and so forth.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[206:34](sbe0269.htm#fr_969) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 22, 4, 16; II, 3, 6, 12. Haradatta\npoints out that in this case nothing but a simple dinner shall be given.\n\n[206:36](sbe0269.htm#fr_970) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 4, 14. \' On failure of grass and\nthe rest, a welcome, i.e. (the host shall say) "Thou art tired, sit down\nhere."\'--Haradatta.\n\n[206:37](sbe0269.htm#fr_971) Manu 111, 106-107. \'This Sutra refers solely to\nsuch a guest, as is described below, Sutra 40.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[206:38](sbe0269.htm#fr_972) \'Accompanying, i.e. walking after him;\nrespectfully attending to, i.e. sitting with him and so forth. As it is not\npossible that these two acts can be performed by the host in the same manner\nas for himself, the meaning of the Sutra must be taken to be merely that they\nare to be performed.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[206:39](sbe0269.htm#fr_973) Haradatta says that some explain this Sutra to\nmean, \'(The host shall show the same attention) even to a man who is a little\ninferior (to himself in learning, &c.),\' but that he disapproves of their\nopinion.\n\n[207:40](sbe0269.htm#fr_974) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 3, 6, 5. Haradatta states, that by\n\'the time when the sun\'s rays pass over the trees,\' either the middle of the\nday or the late afternoon may be meant.\n\n[207:41](sbe0269.htm#fr_975) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 4, 14, 26-29.\n\n[207:43](sbe0269.htm#fr_976) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 2, 4, 18-19.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter VI](sbe0270.htm)\n\n'
