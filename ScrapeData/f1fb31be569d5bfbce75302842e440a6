Battle-charm for confusing the enemy.\n\n1\\. Agni shall skilfully march against our opponents, burning against their\nschemes and hostile plans; Gatavedas shall confuse the army of our opponents\nand deprive them (of the use) of their hands!  \n2\\. Ye Maruts are mighty in such matters: advance ye, crush ye, conquer ye\n(the enerny)! These Vasus when implored did crush (them). Agni, vily, as their\nvanauard shall skilfully attack!  \n3\\. O Maghavan, the hostile army which contends against us--do ye, O Indra,\nVritra's slayer, and Agni, burn against them!  \n4\\. Thy thunderbolt, O Indra, who hast been driven forward swiftly by thy two\nbay steeds, shall advance, crushing the enemies. Slay them that resist,\npursue, or flee, deprive their schemes of fulfilment!  \n5\\. O Indra, confuse the army of the enemy; with the impact of the fire and\nthe wind scatter them to either side!  \n6\\. Indra shall confuse the army, the Miaruts shall slay it with might! Agni\nshall rob it of its sight; vanquished it shall turn about!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2. Battle-charm for confusing the enemy](av146.htm)\n\n"
