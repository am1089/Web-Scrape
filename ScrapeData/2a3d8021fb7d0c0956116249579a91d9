In deep sleep the\nquality of darkness prevails in the mind and there is no consciousness of\noutward things, and thus there is no distinct and clear presentation of the\n'I'; but all the same the Self somehow presents itself up to the time of\nwaking in the one form of the 'I,' and the latter cannot therefore be said to\nbe absent. Pure consciousness assumed by you (to manifest itself in deep\nsleep) is really in no better case; for a person risen from deep sleep. never\nrepresents to himself his state of consciousness during\n\np. 68\n\nsleep in the form, 'I was pure consciousness free from all egoity and opposed\nin nature to everything else, witnessing Nescience'; what he thinks is only 'I\nslept well.' From this form of reflection it appears that even during sleep\nthe Self. i.e. the 'I,' was a knowing subject and perceptive of pleasure. Nor\nmust you urge against this that the reflection has the following form: 'As now\nI feel pleasure, so I slept then also'; for the reflection is distinctly _not_\nof that kind. 1 Nor must you say that owing to the non-permanency of the 'I'\nits perception of pleasure during sleep cannot connect itself with the waking\nstate. For (the 'I' is permanent as appears from the fact that) the person who\nhas risen from sleep recalls things of which he was conscious before his\nsleep, 'I did such and such a thing,' 'I observed this or that,' 'I said so or\nso.'--But, you will perhaps say, he also reflects, 'For such and such a time I\nwas conscious of nothing!'--'And what does this imply?' we ask.--'It implies a\nnegation of everything!'--By no means, we rejoin. The words 'I was conscious'\nshow that the knowing 'I' persisted, and that hence what is negated is only\nthe objects of knowledge. If the negation implied in 'of nothing' included\neverything, it would also negative the pure consciousness which you hold to\npersist in deep sleep. In the judgment 'I was conscious of nothing,' the word\n'I' clearly refers to the 'I,' i.e. the knowing Self which persists even\nduring deep sleep, while the words 'was conscious of nothing' negative all\nknowledge on the part of that 'I'; if, now, in the face of this, you undertake\nto prove by means of this very judgment that knowledge--which is expressly\ndenied--existed at the time, and that the persisting knowing Self did not\nexist, you may address your proof to the patient gods who give no reply!--But\n--our opponent goes on to urge--I form the following judgment also: 'I then\nwas not conscious of myself,' and from this I understand that the 'I' did not\npersist during deep sleep!--You do not know, we rejoin, that this denial of\nthe persistence\n\np. 69\n\nof the 'I' flatly contradicts the state of consciousness expressed in the\njudgment 'I was not conscious of myself' and the verbal form of the judgment\nitself!--But what then is denied by the words 'of myself?--This, we admit, is\na reasonable question. Let us consider the point. What is negatived in that\njudgment is not the knowing 'I' itself, but merely the distinctions of caste,\ncondition of life, &c. which belong to the 'I' at the time of waking. We must\ndistinguish the objects of the several parts of the judgment under discussion.\nThe object of the '(me) myself' is the 'I' distinguished by class\ncharacteristics as it presents itself in the waking state; the object of the\nword 'I' (in the judgment) is that 'I' which consists of a uniform flow of\nself-consciousness which persists in sleep also, but is then not quite\ndistinct. The judgment 'I did not know myself' therefore means that the\nsleeper was not conscious of the place where he slept, of his special\ncharacteristics, and so on.--It is, moreover, your own view that in deep sleep\nthe Self occupies the position of a witnessing principle with regard to\nNescience. But by a witness (sakshin) we understand some one who knows about\nsomething by personal observation (sakshat); a person who does not know cannot\nbe a witness. Accordingly, in scripture as well as in ordinary language a\nknowing subject only, not mere knowledge, is spoken of as a witness; and with\nthis the Reverend Panini also agrees when teaching that the word 'sakshin'\nmeans one who knows in person (Pa. Su. V, 2, 91). Now this witness is nothing\nelse but the 'I' which is apprehended in the judgment 'I know '; and how then\nshould this 'I' not be apprehended in the state of sleep? That which itself\nappears to the Self appears as the 'I,' and it thus follows that also in deep\nsleep and similar states the Self which then shines forth appears as the 'I.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[68:1](sbe48023.htm#fr_12) I. e. the reflection as to the perception of\npleasure refers to the past state of sleep only, not to the present moment of\nreflection.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The conscious subject persists in the state of release](sbe48024.htm)\n\n"
