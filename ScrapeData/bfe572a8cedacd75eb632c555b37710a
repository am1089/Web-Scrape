These\ncases are as well authenticated as anything that comes to us from India is\never likely to be. If we turned our eyes to the ancient literature of that\ncountry, we should see Sa _m_ nyasins in large numbers, but their performances\nwould probably be considered as fabulous, nor should I venture to say that\nthey\n\np. 24\n\nare what we mean by well authenticated. The fact, how-ever, that some of these\nSa _m_ nyasins reduced themselves by ascetic exercises to mere skeletons 1 or\nbecame raving mad-men can hardly be doubted, if we may judge by the warnings\nagainst such excesses which appear at a very early time in the ancient\nliterature of the country. A well-known instance is that of Buddha himself,\nwho, before he founded his own religion, went through all the tortures of\nBrahmanic _ascesis_ , but derived so little benefit from them that he\ndenounced the whole system, as then practised, not only as useless but as\nmischievous, preferring in all things what he called the _via media_.\n\nIf now we turn our attention again to the fourth of the Paramaha _m_ sas,\nrecognised by Keshub Chunder Sen as pre-eminent among his contemporaries, we\nshall feel less surprised by his life and his doctrines, but accept him as one\nof a class which has always existed in India. We possess indeed full accounts\nof his life, but they are often so strangely exaggerated, nay so\ncontradictory, that it seemed almost hopeless to form a correct and true idea\nof his earthly career and his character. I applied therefore to one of his\nmost eminent pupils, Vivekananda, asking him to write down for me what he\ncould tell of his own knowledge of his venerable teacher, and I received from\nhim a full description of his Master's life. It will be easily seen, however,\nthat even this account is not quite free from traditional elements. If I give\nit as much as possible unaltered, I have a reason for it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[24:1](rls12.htm#fr_7) See a remarkable instance in Mrs. Flora Annie Steel's\n'In the Permanent Way,' 1898.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Dialogic Process](rls13.htm)\n\n"
