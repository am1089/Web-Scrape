So long, Ram, as you attain the Atmic state by thy\nconstant mastery of externals, your mind will ever be engaged in enquiry into\nthe unlimited pure wisdom (inculcated by your wise Guru and the Holy\nprecepts). The supreme state may be reached through Atmic enquiry; by turning\naside from worldly objects., discernment of the true significance of the Books\nof Wisdom; one\'s own intelligence; initiation by a Guru; refraining from\ntaking the life of any living thing; purity; or it can be attained by one\'s\nintelligence alone. Lacking all else, liberation will be his who is possessed\nof subtle and stainless intelligence, and is initiated by a Guru.\n\nUpon hearing Muni Vashisht, Ram enquired:\n\np. 137\n\n[paragraph continues] "The persons named by you divide into two classes. One\nclass frees itself of pain and attains the unity of wisdom by going into\nSamadhi while still doing the work of the world; the other retires from action\nin the world and goes into Samadhi. Of these two which is superior? Please\nenlighten me clearly on this point."\n\nTo which Vashisht answered: "In Samadhi there is recognition of the inactivity\nof this world. The mind becomes completely passionless, with no concern for\nthe world or its objects. Whether one enters Samadhi from amid the turmoil of\nthe world, or the quiet depths of a forest, there is no difference. Both have\nattained complete equipoise of mind, and the incalculable fruits of the great\nmeditation are theirs. In this state of illumination, the serenity of mind is\nabsolute. Therefore, O Ram, it matters not by what door one enter:, the\nsublime state of Samadhi--within lies liberation.\n\n"When the desires are extinct, the performance of actions will be as if not\ndone, like one, who, deep in mental concentration does not hear the voices of\nby-standers. But if the gross mind still has desire, though one has withdrawn\n\np. 138\n\nfrom worldly action, then one\'s actions are performed in the dreaming state\nwhen the body is as if paralyzed. Know, O Ram, when the mind performs action,\nbut is yet free from it, that state is called the blissful Samadhi; the\nunchanging Nirvana and [transcendent](errata.htm#15) bliss.\n\n"The two kinds of vision, meditation and non-meditation, are the results of\nthe steady mind and the oscillating mind. Therefore, all the attributes of the\nmind must be controlled. It is said, that meditation is the firm mind itself,\ndevoid of desire or vexatious thoughts. Pain, internal or external, wears away\nin this Nirvanic state. A mind which is above its worries will reach Nirvana.\nDesires breed endless pain and misery in mental worry, and should therefore be\nreliquished.\n\n"When all conception of "I" among the multitude of visibles is vanquished, it\ndoes not matter where you live, O Ram, whether in a house, on a hillside or in\nthe great forest. The blessed of quiescent mind, who have let go egoism find\nin the busiest household, the solitude of the forest. They who stroll in a\nstreet. desiring nothing therein, really possess the street. Similarly, to\n\np. 139\n\nthose in full spiritual beatitude, the city and the wood are the same. The\nforest retreat and the city abode become alike to him of introspective mind,\nand the functions of sleeping, waking or walking do not disturb this\ntranquillity of mind.\n\n"O quiescent mind, thou twin of Prana, thy cooling dew will chill the hot\nflowers of desire, and over all the universe shall be sweet peace. But should\nthe mind become heated with the illusion of the world, then the hot breath of\ndesire will sweep over the universe, like a great raging forest fire, leaving\nbut ashes in its wake.\n\n"The inner processes of mind are revealed in external actions. The earth, sky\nand air are all manifestations of the lower mind. He who loses himself in\nearthly joys will never enjoy the surpassing delight of Samadhi. But he who\nrecognizes that the function of the lower mind must operate, but yet is aloof\nfrom mundane enjoyment, finds pure delight in Atma (wisdom). He who lives in\nthe life of others, spurning wealth, and seeing the world as it really is, is\nthe real Knower.\n\n"Whether death comes now or at the end of a\n\np. 140\n\ncycle, these wise ones will never be corrupted in mind. The Vedas proclaim\nthem as the blessed conquerors of the illusory conceptions of duality and\nbelief in endings and beginnings, true enjoyers of bliss. By these\ncharacteristics, may we recognize those who have attained wisdom. But the\nrecognition will not aid, O Ram, in the conception of the universal soul, for\nin words alone wisdom does not lie. Only in the divine word OM is Brahma\nhidden.\n\n"O, benignant Ram, I shall relate to thee a story which illustrates the\nattainment of Atmic wisdom. Hear thou this history of Suragho, which is indeed\nwonderful.\n\n"Suragho was a mighty hunter and ruler of the Kiratas *. He lived with his\npeople, who were adepts in archery, in the Kailasa hills on the summit of the\nHimalayas.\n\n"Whilst he administered royal justice with strict impartiality, rewarding the\nrighteous and punishing the wrongdoers, he soliloquized: \'If in the exercise\nof my royal power I afflict my people, are not their pains mine? Yet, if I do\nnot punish them according to prescribed law, they shall have lived in vain. It\nis indeed a difficult\n\np. 141\n\ntask to rule over a kingdom.\'\n\n"The tender king was sorely troubled in mind.\n\n"Muni Mandavya made a timely appearance. To him Suragho paid honor, and\naddressed him: \'O virtuous Muni, thy coming fills me with happiness. It is\nindeed a blessing to know that I am in thy notice. Thou, righteous Lord, hast\nlong been free from melancholy of spirit. Help me to clear my mind of the\nmisgivings that assail me. What else torments the mind of man more than doubt?\nMy head is awhirl, O Muni, with the miseries and joys my subjects experience\nin obeying my will. Let the sun of wisdom light the darkness of my mind, and\nequality of vision comfort me.\'\n\n"Muni Mandavya replied: \'Atmic enquiry will clear away the fog of illusion,\n[Suragho](errata.htm#16). Ask thyself ceaselessly, Who am I? Whence came the\nuniverse? Whence came birth and death? If you do this faithfully the reward of\nthe Brahmic Seat shall be yours. When you make Atmic enquiry habitual, your\nmind will obey your will and you will cease your agonizing. To a poised mind\nthe ups and downs of life appear trivial.\n\np. 142\n\n[paragraph continues] Does the elephant flee at sight of oxen tracks? What is\nof no consequence to the wise is appalling to others. For does not the rain,\ngathered in the footprint of a cow, seem an ocean of incalculable area to a\nmosquito? Know thou, Suragho, that the farther removed thou art from worldly\ndistractions, the brighter the light of God illumines thee. Just so long as\nyou are engrossed in the affairs of the world, the true principle of God will\nnot be recognized by you. Deific light will not shine when dualities still\nexist in the mind. It is as difficult to realize Atmic Reality, as to know\nthat the alchemy of gold is not more to nature, than that of the baser metals.\nTherefore, longing for the things of the world must cease. The reward is the\nattainment of [liberation](errata.htm#17)--the supreme Brahmic state. O\nillustrious hunter, control your mind, and keep it free from bodily and unwise\ndesires; so shall you then attain the stainless and beneficent Principle.\'\n\n"So saying Muni Mandavya returned to his own abode.\n\n"The mighty hunter withdrew into his cave and in solitude began enquiry into\norigin of\n\np. 143\n\nthe "I". His meditations took the following form.--How absurd, he thought, to\ncall my body "I", for my body is composed of flesh and bone, which in its\nseparate arts is passive. Hence my body is not \'I\'. The ten organs of sense\nare other than the \'I\'. I am not, then, the organs of my body. What remains is\nego. What actuates my ego? Consciousness. But the universal consciousness\ncannot be termed the Reality. Therefore, I shall free myself from the Jiva *\nstate and become "THAT" ** which above all else, I desire to know. The\nfullness of wisdom, [changeless](errata.htm#18) and stainless, alone is my\nReality. This [transcendent](errata.htm#19) Wisdom pervades all like the\nstrand upon which pearls are strung,--Vishnu, Brahma, Devendra, Yama and all\nother states. This supreme and powerful Wisdom or Realization is not tainted\nby worldliness, is of divine aspect, and finds completion in all objects; has\nneither existence nor non-existence; is subtle and permeates all, even the\nabode of Truth where lives Brahma. This consciousness is the residual of all\nother potencies. It is due to motion or fluctuation of this consciousness, and\nto nothing else, that the diversified objects of this world are due.\n\np. 144\n\n"Having [relinquished](errata.htm#20) the objective world and freed himself\nfrom the shackles of desire and delusion--delusion which follows one even in\nhis seventh rebirth--Suragho maintained equality of vision, as one stationary\nin the Sushupti * state. Free at last, though living in Atmic reality, he\nreached the Brahmic state and attained the status of a Brahman, like unto Raja\nRishi Viswamitra, of extraordinary meditation.\n\n"Thus did Suragho reach the Sushupti or dreamless state, wherein action is\nstilled, like a picture of a candle alight. In that state he was, and the\nopposites of love and hate, blessing or curse, association or separation,\nintelligence or ignorance, assailed him not.\n\n"Vashisht continued, O Ram, pillar of strength hear also what took place\nbetween Suragho who attained, and a Raja Rishi named Parnada. Suragho had a\nfriend, Parigha by name, of the race of Paraseeka, who was also a king. When\nParigha\'s kingdom suffered a ten year drought, and famine and his people\nperished in great numbers, his heart gave way . He left his native country and\nwent into a forest to meditate, denying himself food and subsisting\n\np. 145\n\nupon dry leaves. Because of this he was called Parnada *. Through the\nrenunciation he practiced and his holy meditations, he attained Atmic wisdom,\nfor none could compete with the strenuosities of this kingly recluse. This\nMuni, who traveled the three worlds as though he walked thru the room of a\ndwelling, appeared before King Suragho. Each responded to the other\'s\naffectionate greeting and found pleasure in reciting their respective\nexperiences.\n\n"In welcome Suragho said, \'My heart overflows with joy and exquisite bliss. I\nhail thee, O, honorable One.\'\n\n"Parnada answered; \'The sight of thee lifts me into that Jnana ** state into\nwhich Muni Mandavya initiated you. O, King, art thou able to direct thy\nworldly affairs with equality and clarity of vision? Hast thy body, changed by\nthe passing years, remained free from diseases, either physical or mental?\nCanst thou preserve thy equilibrium of mind amid the inordinate luxuries of\nwealth? Hast thou been able to merge into Samadhi *** without thought, by\nfollowing the paths of extreme serenity and solitude and\n\np. 146\n\nforms actions or not, he who has Realized will always be poised in the\nSamadhic state. O Brother in Attainment, they who have not equanimity of mind\nwill never be able to go into Samadhi, even though they sit in the Padme\nposture and offer salutations to Brahma. It is the fullness of Atmic wisdom\nwhich constitutes the noble Samadhi. If the mind controlled by concentration\nknows Reality, such a wise one may be said to enjoy Samadhi. The intelligence\nof the wise, free from illusion, yet mindful of worldly action, will not\nforget for a moment the eternity of Atmic Reality. As air flows freely in any\ndirection, the wise intelligence will always follow the path of unchanging\nAtmic wisdom. The wise, who are in rapport with the indivisible Intelligence,\nhaving abandoned the illusion of the opposites except as worldly recognition\nis necessary, can be said to have attained the Brahmic Seat. Therefore, those\nblessed in wisdom, who refrain from too much consideration for bodily action,\nand who have enlivened the intelligence by the acquisition of holy knowledge,\nmay penetrate everywhere. Thou hast recognized the Intelligence which is\nwondrous and\n\np. 147\n\nchangeless. Thou hast attained the Brahmic state. Thy mind has been purged\nfrom worldliness, and thy heart is liberated from egoism. Having known the\ncertainty of Atma, thou art complete and full in thy Self.\n\n"Suragho made answer: \'Of what avail are circuitous expressions? To say it\nbriefly, it is this, when all longing for the fruits of action cease, and the\nmind looks upon all equally, being directed within itself, then Brahmic bliss\narises, the incomparable Wise-Vision is developed, and the resolute Atmic\nReality alone illumines.\'"\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[140:*](yvhf11.htm#fr_9) Hunters.\n\n[143:*](yvhf11.htm#fr_10) Ego\n\n[143:**](yvhf11.htm#fr_11) Brahma\n\n[144:*](yvhf11.htm#fr_12) Dreamless.\n\n[145:*](yvhf11.htm#fr_13) Parna--leaves; ad--to eat.\n\n[145:**](yvhf11.htm#fr_14) Wisdom.\n\n[145:***](yvhf11.htm#fr_15) Blissful state.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Long-Lived Yogi and the Secret of His Longevity](yvhf12.htm)\n\n'
