But from the highest (Lord there result sa _m_ sara and moksha), because\nscripture teaches that.\n\nWe now enter on the discussion whether the agentship, characterising the\nindividual soul in the state of Nescience and founded on its limiting\nadjuncts, is independent of the Lord or dependent on him.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that the soul as far as it is an agent does not\ndepend on the Lord, because the assumption of such a dependence would serve no\npurpose. For as the individual soul has motives in its own imperfections, such\nas passion, aversion, and so on, and is furnished with the whole apparatus of\nthe other constituents of action 1, it is able to occupy on its own account\nthe position of an agent; and what then should the Lord do for it? Nor does\nordinary experience show that in addition to the oxen which are required for\nsuch actions as ploughing and the like the Lord also is to be depended upon.\nMoreover (if all activity depended on the Lord) it would follow that the Lord\nis cruel because imposing on his creatures activity which is essentially\npainful, and at the same time unjust because allotting to their activities\nunequal results.--But it has already been shown (II, 1, 34) that the Lord\ncannot be taxed with cruelty and injustice, on account of his dependence.--\nTrue, that has been shown, but only on the condition of the dependence on the\nLord being possible. Now such dependence is possible only if there exist\nreligious merit and demerit on the part of the creatures, and these again\nexist if the soul is an agent; if then the agentship of the soul again depends\non the Lord, whereupon will the Lord's dependence depend? And (if we should\nassume the Lord to determine the souls without reference to their merits and\ndemerits) it would follow that the souls have to undergo\n\np. 59\n\nconsequences not due to their actions.--Hence the soul's activity is\nindependent.\n\nSetting aside this prima facie by means of the word 'but,' the Sutrakara\nasserts 'from the highest.' For the soul which in the state of Nescience is\nblinded by the darkness of ignorance and hence unable to distinguish itself\nfrom the complex of effects and instruments, the sa _m_ sara-state in which it\nappears as agent and enjoyer brought about through the permission of the Lord\nwho is the highest Self, the superintendent of all actions, the witness\nresiding in all beings, the cause of all intelligence; and we must therefore\nassume that final release also is effected through knowledge caused by the\ngrace of the Lord.\n\nWhy so?--'Because scripture teaches that.' For although the soul has its own\nimperfections, such as passion and so on, for motives, and is furnished with\nthe whole apparatus of action, and although ordinary experience does not show\nthat the Lord is a cause in occupations such as ploughing and the like, yet we\nascertain from scripture that the Lord is a causal agent in all activity. For\nscripture says, 'He makes him whom he wishes to lead up from these worlds do a\ngood deed; and the same makes him whom he wishes to lead down from these\nworlds, do a bad deed' (Kau. Up. III, 8); and again, 'He who dwelling within\nthe Self pulls the Self within' ( _S_ at. Br. XIV, 6, 7, 30).\n\nBut if causal agency thus belongs to the Lord, it follows that he must be\ncruel and unjust, and that the soul has to undergo consequences of what it has\nnot done.--This objection the following Sutra refutes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[58:1](sbe38042.htm#fr_39) I.e. the constituents of action such as instrument,\nobject, &c., exclusive of the agent.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 42](sbe38043.htm)\n\n"
