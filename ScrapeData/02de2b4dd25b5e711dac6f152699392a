Wilkins, [1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 93\n\n### CHAPTER II.\n\n#### BRAHMA. *\n\nBrahma is regarded as the Supreme Being, the God of gods; of whom Brahm\xc4\x81,\nVishnu, and Siva are manifestations. It is true that, in some verses of the\nVedas, attributes ascribed to him are also ascribed to other deities, and in\nsome of the Pur\xc4\x81nas various gods are said to be identical with the supreme\nBrahma; nevertheless Brahma is regarded by the Hindus (for which opinion there\nis abundant authority in their scriptures) as the Supreme God--the origin of\nall the others, and of whom they are manifestations. Thus we read in the\n"Atharva-Veda":-- \xe2\x80\xa0 "All the gods are in (Brahma) as cows in a cow-house. In\nthe beginning Brahma was this [universe]. He created gods. Having created\ngods, he placed them in these worlds, viz. Agni in this world, V\xc4\x81yu in the\natmosphere, and Surya in the sky. And in the worlds which are yet higher, he\nplaced the gods which are still higher. Then Brahma proceeded to the higher\nsphere [which is explained by the commentator to mean the Satyaloka, the most\nexcellent and limit of all the worlds]. The gods were originally mortal; but\nwhen they were pervaded by Brahma, they became immortal." In the "Taittiriya\nBr\xc4\x81hmana" it is said:\n\np. 94\n\n[paragraph continues] "Brahma generated the gods, Brahma (generated) this\nentire world. Within him are all these worlds. Within him is this entire\nuniverse. It is Brahma who is the greatest of beings. Who can vie with him? In\nBrahma, the thirty-three gods; in Brahma, Indra and Praj\xc4\x81pati; in Brahma all\nthings are contained as in a ship."\n\nProf. Monier Williams * says:--"Only a few hymns of the Vedas appear to\ncontain the simple conception of one divine self, existent, omnipresent being;\nand even in these, the idea of one god present in all nature is somewhat\nnebulous and undefined." Further on he says: "In the Purusha S\xc5\xabkta of the Rig-\nVeda, the one spirit is called Purusha. The more common name in the later\nsystem is Br\xc4\x81hman, neuter (nom. Brahma), derived from the root _brih_ , \'to\nexpand,\' and denoting the universally expanding essence, or universally\ndiffused substance of the universe . . . Br\xc4\x81hman, in the neuter, being\n\'simple, infinite being\'--the only real eternal essence--which, when it passes\ninto actual manifested existence, is called Brahm\xc4\x81; when it develops itself in\nthe world, is called Vishnu; and when it again dissolves itself into simple\nbeing, is called Siva; all the other innumerable gods and demi-gods being also\nmere manifestations of the neuter Br\xc4\x81hman, who is eternal."\n\nIn the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0 Brahma is translated as "abstract supreme spirit."\nLater on \xe2\x80\xa1 the question is asked, "How can creative agency be attributed to\nBrahma, who [as abstract spirit] is without qualities, illimitable, and free\nfrom imperfection?" The answer is, that "the essential properties of existent\nthings are objects of observation, of which no foreknowledge is attainable;\nand creation and hundreds of properties\n\np. 95\n\nbelong to Brahma as inseparable, parts of his essence, as heat is inherent in\nfire." The Pur\xc4\x81na goes on to say that creation is effected through the agency\nof Brahm\xc4\x81, the first manifestation of Brahma; and then declares that Vishnu is\none with Brahm\xc4\x81.\n\nAgain, the same Pur\xc4\x81na * says: "There are two states of this Brahma--one with,\nand one without shape; one perishable, one imperishable; which are inherent in\nall beings. The imperishable is the supreme being; the perishable is all the\nworld. The blaze of fire burning in one spot diffuses light and heat around;\nso the world is nothing more than the manifested energy of the supreme Brahma;\nand inasmuch as the light and heat are stronger or feebler as we are near to\nthe fire or far off from it, so the energy of the supreme is more or less\nintense in the beings that are less or more remote from him. Brahm\xc4\x81, Vishnu,\nand Siva are the most powerful energies of God; next to them are the inferior\ndeities; then the attendant spirits; then men; then animals, birds, insects,\nvegetables; each becoming more and more feeble as they are farther from their\nprimitive source."\n\nThe "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" \xe2\x80\xa0 gives the following derivation of the word Brahma:--It\n"is derived from the root _vriha_ (to increase), because it is infinite\n(spirit), and because it is the cause by which the Vedas (and all things) are\ndeveloped." Then follows this hymn to Brahma:--"Glory to Brahma, who is\naddressed by that mystic word ( _Om_ ), \xe2\x80\xa1 associated eternally with the triple\nuniverse (earth, sky, and heaven), and who is one with\n\np. 96\n\nthe four Vedas. Glory to Brahma, who alike in the destruction and renovation\nof the world is called the great and mysterious cause of the intellectual\nprinciple; who is without limit in time or space, and exempt from diminution\nand decay. . .. He is the invisible, imperishable Brahma; varying in form,\ninvariable in substance; the chief principle, self-engendered; who is said to\nilluminate the caverns of the heart; who is indivisible, radiant, undecaying,\nmultiform. To that supreme Brahma be for ever adoration."\n\nIn perfect harmony with this teaching of the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" is the common\nbelief of the Hindus. No phrase is more commonly used by them when speaking of\nthe divine being than this: "God (Brahma) is one without a second." The word\nused by them for God as distinguished from his manifestations, is Brahma; and\nwhen charged with Polytheism, and of violating the primary law respecting the\nunity of God, they reply that Brahm\xc4\x81, Vishnu, Siva, etc., are only\nmanifestations of the supreme Brahma. *\n\nIn the earliest writings Brahma signified a hymn or mantra, whilst Brahm\xc4\x81 was\nthe term used to denote a priest or worshipper. It is in the later parts of\nthe Vedas that Brahma is identified with the supreme, and Brahm\xc4\x81 becomes his\ngreat manifestation. Praj\xc4\x81pati, the lord of creatures, was the Creator\naccording to the earlier teaching of the Vedas, and occupied the position in\nthe earlier Pantheon that Brahm\xc4\x81 did in the later. In several texts of the\nVedas the two are identified, and thus authority is found for the idea that\nBrahm\xc4\x81 is to be worshipped as the Maker of all things.\n\np. 97\n\nThis Brahm\xc4\x81, though satisfactory to the priests, was not so to the common\npeople. In process of time local gods absorbed their worship, and the non-\nAryan deities of the people whom they had conquered exercised their influence\non the Aryans themselves. Rather than lose their hold of the people, the\npriests adopted these new deities, and found a parentage for them from amongst\nthe old Vedic gods. By the time the Epics were composed, Vishnu and Siva had\nbeen thus assimilated. The different names by which these deities are now\nknown may possibly have been the local names of local or tribal gods; by\nretaining these the priests also retained their hold upon the people. In the\n"Satapatha Br\xc4\x81hmana" attempts are made to identify Siva with Agni, as though\nthe writer wished to show that the later triad--Brahm\xc4\x81, Vishnu, and Siva--was\nidentical with the older one composed of Agni, Indra-V\xc4\x81yu, and Surya.\n\n![](img/09700.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[93:*](hmvp16.htm#fr_91) It will be noticed that the final vowel in the name\nof this deity is _short_ , whilst in that of the first incarnation it is\n_long_.\n\n[93:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp16.htm#fr_92) Muir, O.
