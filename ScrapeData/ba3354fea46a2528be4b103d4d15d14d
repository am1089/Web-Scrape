(The twofold view taken above) is justified because we observe a purpose\ncharacterised thereby (i.e. a purpose of the going); as in ordinary life.\n\nOur view of the matter, viz. that a man's proceeding on the path of the gods\nhas a meaning in certain cases but not in others, is justified by the\nfollowing consideration. In meditations on the qualified Brahman such as the\nparya\xe1\xb9\x85ka-vidya we see a reason for the man's proceeding on the path of the\ngods; for the text mentions certain results which can be reached only by the\nman going to different places, such as his mounting a couch, his holding a\ncolloquy with Brahman seated on the couch, his perceiving various odours and\nso on. On the other hand we do not see that going on the path of the gods has\nanything to do with perfect knowledge. For those who have risen to the\nintuition of the Self's unity, whose every wish is fulfilled, in whom the\npotentiality of all suffering is already destroyed here below, have nothing\nfurther to look for but the dissolution of the abode of activity and enjoyment\nof former deeds, i.e. the body; in their case therefore to proceed on the road\nof the gods would be purposeless.--The distinction is analogous to what is\nobserved in ordinary life. If we want to reach some village we have to proceed\non a path leading there; but no moving on a path is required when we wish to\nattain freedom from sickness.--The distinction made here will be established\nmore carefully in the fourth adhyaya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 31](sbe38174.htm)\n\n"
