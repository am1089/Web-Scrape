I have translated it for the Truth\nSeeker, as it is very highly respected by all devotees of the Kundalini, The\nMother of the Universe. It is the best japa to please the Mother of the\nUniverse. All Mantras are hidden in this japa, the fulfilment of all desires.\nThe sick have been healed by only reading it, the poor have attained wealth,\nand fears have been removed. "To obtain the favor of the Mother of the\nUniverse, one should repeat the Thousand Names."\n\n"He who recites my Thousand Names once, is my devotee. He shall be known as\ndear to me, and I will give him all that he desires when having worshipped me\nin the Sir Chakras."\n\nThe Vyu Purana says: "One should repeat Devi\'s names on the water, in the\nforest, on the land, and any place where fear arises from wild animals or\nthieves. The names of Devi\'s should be repeated always, for such a one will be\nliberated from himself and bondage."\n\np. 88\n\nThe Kebika Purana says: "O Mother of the Universe, those who praise Thee by\nwords,--Ambika, Jaganmaya and Maya will obtain All."\n\n"The Vandika and Tantrika rites of repeating once the Thousand Names are\nbetter than bathing in the Holy Ganges, or other places."\n\nFor the purification of oneself and fulfilment of desires, repeat the Thousand\nNames.\n\nSwami Vivekananda, wrote in his book Raja Yoga, about, \'The power of words.\'\n"There are certain sacred words called Mantrams, which have power, when\nrepeated under proper conditions, to produce these extraordinary powers. We\nare living in the midst of such a mass of miracles, day and night, that we do\nnot think anything of them. There is no limit to man\'s power, the power of\nwords and the power of mind."\n\nThe reader will find these Thousand sayings, like the Upanishads teachings,\nbeginning from Gross to Subtle and more Subtle Truth. The repetition of many\nwords will be found here but these are most important.\n\nAuthor--May 10, 1930.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Lalita Sahasranama](kmu12.htm)\n\n'
