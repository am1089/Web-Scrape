And Scripture declares the difference.\n\nThe text, 'He who meditates on name as Brahman, for him there is movement as\nhe wishes as far as name extends,' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 1 ff.), declares that\nthose who meditate on the series of symbols beginning with name and ending\nwith pra _n_ a attain to a result of limited nature and not depending on any\nparticular path. Those therefore who meditate on the Intelligent either as\nmixed with the Non-intelligent or by itself, viewing it either under the\naspect of Brahman or as separated from Brahman, are not led on by the\nconducting deities. On the other hand, it remains a settled conclusion that\nthe deities speed on their way those who meditate on the highest Brahman and\non the soul as separated from Prak _ri_ ti and having Brahman for its true\nSelf.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the effected.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fourth Pada: 1.
