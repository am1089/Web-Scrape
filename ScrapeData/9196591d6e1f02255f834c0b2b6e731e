XVII.\n\nDescendants of Druhyu.\n\nTHE son of Druhyu was Babhru; his son was Setu; his son was \xc3\x81radwat 1; his son\nwas Gandhara 2; his son was Dharma 3; his son was Dhrita 4; his son was\nDuryaman 5; his son was Prachetas, who had a hundred sons, and they were the\nprinces of the lawless Mlechchhas or barbarians of the north 6.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[443:1](vp110.htm#fr_1189) Also \xc3\x81raddha in MSS., and \xc3\x81rat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a, Matsya, which\nlast seems to be the preferable reading. The Vayu has \xc3\x81ruddha; the Brahma,\nAngarasetu; but \xc3\x81rat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a is a northern country, contiguous to, or synonymous\nwith, Gandhara.\n\n[443:2](vp110.htm#fr_1190) Of Gandhara it is said in the Vayu that it is a\nlarge country named after him, and is famous for its breed of horses: ###. The\nMatsya reads the beginning of the second line ###, shewing that \xc3\x81rat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a and\nGandhara are much the same. See [p. 191](vp061.htm#page_191). n.\n[83](vp061.htm#fn_559).\n\n[443:3](vp110.htm#fr_1191) The Brahma P. and Hari V., in opposition to all the\nrest, make Dharma and his successors the descendants of Anu.\n\n[443:4](vp110.htm#fr_1192) Ghrita: Agni.\n\n[443:5](vp110.htm#fr_1193) Durdama: Vayu and Bhagavata. The Matsya, Brahma,\nand Agni insert a Vidupa, Duduha, or Vidula, before Prachetas.\n\n[443:6](vp110.htm#fr_1194) So the Bhagavata and Matsya. The Mahabharata says\nthe descendants of Druhya are the Vaibhojas, a people unacquainted with the\nuse of cars or beasts of burden, and who travel on rafts: they have no kings.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVIII](vp111.htm)\n\n'
