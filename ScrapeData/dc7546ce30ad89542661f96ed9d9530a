Prayer to the plant arundhati for protection to cattle.\n\n1\\. Thy foremost protection, O Arundhati, do thou bestow upon steer and milch-\nkine, upon (cattle of) the age when weaned from their mother, upon (all) four-\nfooted creatures!  \n2\\. May Arundhati, the herb, bestow protection along with the gods, render\nfull of sap the stable, free from disease our men!  \n3\\. The variegated, lovely, life-giving (plant) do I invoke. May she carry\naway for us, far from the cattle, the missile hurled by Rudra!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 70. Charm to secure the attachment of a cow to her calf](av171.htm)\n\n'
