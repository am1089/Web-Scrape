If, after wasting his strength except in his sleep, he desires to become\nfree from the stain and holy,\n\n5\\. He causes the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his\nnails to be cut on the day of the new moon or of the full moon, and takes upon\nhimself a vow according to the rule prescribed for students,\n\n6\\. (To be kept) during a year, or a month, or twenty-four days, or twelve\nnights, or six or three nights. 6\n\n7\\. Let him not eat meat, nor approach a woman, not sit on (a couch or seat,\nand) beware of (speaking an) untruth. 7\n\n8\\. To subsist on milk (alone is) the most excellent mode of living; or, using\nbarley-gruel (as his food), he may perform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra (penance) of\ntwelve days, or he may (maintain himself by) begging. 8\n\np. 301\n\n9\\. On such (occasions) a Kshatriya (shall subsist on) barley-gruel, a Vai _s_\nya on curds of two-milk whey.\n\n10\\. Having kindled the sacred fire in the morning according to the rule for\nPakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, having scattered (Ku _s_ a grass) around it, and having\nperformed (the preliminary ceremonies) up to the end of the Agnimukha, he next\noffers in addition burnt oblations, reciting the three Anuvakas (beginning),\n\'What cause of anger to the gods, ye gods,\' \'The debts which I contracted,\'\n(and) \'May worshipful Agni give thee by every means long life.\' 10\n\n11\\. Let him offer with each _Ri_ k-verse a portion of clarified butter.\n\n12\\. After having offered four oblations with (the spoon called) Sruva,\nreciting (the texts), \'That strength which lies in the lion, in the tiger, and\nin the panther,\' &c., and the four Abhyavartinis (i.e. the texts), \'Thou, O\nfire, who turnest back,\' &c., \'O A\xe1\xb9\x85giras,\' &c., \'Again with strength,\' &c.,\n(and) \'With wealth,\' &c., after having taken his position, with sacred fuel in\nhis hands, in the place allotted to the sacrificer, he worships (the fire)\nwith the hymn which contains twelve verses (and begins), \'To Vai _s_ vanara we\nannounce.\' 12\n\n13\\. Having placed the piece of sacred fuel (on the fire with the text),\n\'Whatever sin I ever committed 13\n\np. 302\n\nby thoughts or words, from all that free me (O fire, being duly) praised, for\nthou knowest the truth, Svaha,\' he gives a fee.\n\n14\\. (The ceremonies) which begin with the muttering (of the texts) and end\nwith the gift of a cow as a fee are known.\n\n15\\. One (person) only (shall) perform the service of the fire.\n\n16\\. Now (let him offer) at the Agnyadheya full oblations (pur _n_ ahuti, with\nthe texts), \'Whatever cause of anger to the gods, ye gods;\' \'The debts which I\ncontracted;" May worshipful Agni give thee by every means long life.\' 16\n\n17\\. Having offered (it), he who is about to perform the Agnihotra, (worships)\nwith the Da _s_ ahot _ri_ (texts); having offered (it), he who is about to\nperform the new and full moon sacrifices (worships) with the _K_ aturhot _ri_\n(texts); having offered (it), he who is about to offer the _K_ aturmasya\nsacrifices (worships) with the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ahot _ri_ (texts); having offered\nit, (he worships) at an animal sacrifice with the Sha _d_ _dh_ ot _ri_\n(texts), at a Soma-sacrifice with the Saptahot _ri_ (texts). 17\n\n18\\. And it is declared in the Veda, \'Let him sacrifice (with the Kushma _n_\n_d_ a texts) at the beginning of the rites; purified (thereby) he gains the\nworld of the gods.\' Thus (speaks) the Brahma _n_ a. 18\n\np. 303\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[300:1](sbe1479.htm#fr_1364)-3. **7**.
