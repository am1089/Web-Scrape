The\nyear be our lord who gives breath to us; may days and nights produce long\nlife. Svaha!\n\n'Peaceful be the earth, happy the air, may the goddess Heaven give us safety.\nHappy be the quarters (of the horizon), the intermediate quarters, the upper\nquarters; may the waters, the lightnings protect us from all sides. Svaha!\n\n'May the waters, the rays carry our prayers (to the gods); may the creator,\nmay the ocean turn away evil; may the past and the future, (may) all be safe\nto me. Protected by Brahman may I pour forth songs. Svaha!\n\n'May all the \xc3\x82dityas and the divine Vasus, the Rudras, the protectors, the\nMaruts sit down (here). May Pra _g_ apati, the abounding one, the highest\nruler, bestow vigour, offspring, immortality on me. Svaha!\n\n'Pra _g_ apati, no other one than Thou (Rig-veda X, 121, 10).'\n\np. 208\n\n15\\.
