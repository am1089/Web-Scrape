He who knows the gradual development of the self in him (the man conceived\nas the uktha), obtains himself more development.\n\n2\\. There are herbs and trees and all that is animated, and he knows the self\ngradually developing in them. For in herbs and trees sap only is seen 2, but\nthought ( _k_ itta) in animated beings.\n\nAmong animated beings again the self develops gradually, for in some sap\n(blood) is seen (as well as thought), but in others thought is not seen.\n\n4\\. And in man again the self develops gradually, for he is most endowed with\nknowledge. He says what he has known, he sees what he has known 3. He knows\nwhat is to happen to-morrow, he knows heaven and hell. By means of the mortal\nhe desires the immortal--thus is he endowed.\n\n5\\. With regard to the other animals hunger and thirst only are a kind of\nunderstanding. But they do not say what they have known, nor do they see\n\np. 223\n\nwhat they have known. They do not know what is to happen to-morrow, nor heaven\nand hell. They go so far and no further, for they are born according to their\nknowledge (in a former life).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[222:1](sbe01215.htm#fr_553) This treats of the gradual development of life in\nman, particularly of the development of a thinking soul ( _k_ aitanya).\n\n[222:2](sbe01215.htm#fr_554) In stones there is not even sap, but only being,\nsatta. Comm.\n\n[222:3](sbe01215.htm#fr_555) What he has known yesterday he remembers, and is\nable to say before men, I know this. And when he has known a thing he\nremembers it, and goes to the same place to see it again. Comm.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 3](sbe01216.htm)\n\n'
