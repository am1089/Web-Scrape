Glorification of the sun, or the primeval principle, as a Brahman\ndisciple.\n\n1\\. The Brahmakarin (Brahmanical disciple) moves inciting both hemispheres of\nthe world; in him the gods are harmonised. He holds the heavens and the earth,\nhe fills the teacher with creative fervour (tapas).  \n2\\. The fathers, the divine folk, and all the gods severally follow the\nBrahmakarin; the Gandharvas did go after him, six thousand three hundred and\nthirty-three. He fills all the gods with creative fervour.  \n3\\. When the teacher receives the Brahmakarin as a disciple, he places him as\na foetus inside (of his body). He carries him for three nights in his belly:\nwhen he is born the gods gather about to see him.  \n4\\. This earth is (his first) piece of firewood, the heaven the second, and\nthe atmosphere also he fills with (the third) piece of firewood. The\nBrahmakarin. fills the worlds with his firewood, his girdle, his asceticism,\nand his creative fervour.  \n5\\. Prior to the brahma (spiritual exaltation) the Brahmakarin was born;\nclothed in heat, by creative fervour he arose. From him sprung the brahmanam\n(Brahmanic life) and the highest brahma, and all the gods together with\nimmortality (amrita).  \n6\\. The Brahmakarin advances, kindled by the firewood, clothed in the skin of\nthe black antelope, consecrated, with long beard. Within the day he passes\nfrom the eastern to the northern sea; gathering together the worlds he\nrepeatedly shapes them.  \n7\\. The Brahmakarin, begetting the brahma, the waters, the world, Pragapati\nParameshthin (he that stands in the hiahest place), and Virag, having become\nan embryo in the womb of immortality, having forsooth, become Indra, pierced\nthe Asuras.  \n8\\. The teacher fashioned these two hern spheres of the world, the broad and\nthe deep, earth and heaven. These the Brahmakarin guards with his creative\nfervour (tapas): in him the gods are harmonised.  \n9\\. This broad earth and the heaven the Brahmakarin first brought hither as\nalms. Having made these into two sticks of firewood he reveres them upon them\nall beings have been founded.  \n10\\. One is on the hither side, the other on the farther side of the back of\nthe heavens; secretly are deposited the two receptacles of the brahmanam\n(Brahmanic life). These the Brahmakarin protects by his tapas (creative\nfervour); understandingly he performs that brahma (spiritual exaltation)\nsolely.  \n11\\. One on the hither side, the other away from the earth, do the two Agnis\ncome together between these two hemispheres (of the world). To them adhere the\nrays firmly; the Brahmakarin by his tapas (creative fervour) enters into the\n(rays).  \n12\\. Shouting forth, thundering, red, white he carries a great penis along the\nearth. The Brahmakarin sprinkles seed upon the back of the earth; through it\nthe four directions live.  \n13\\. Into fire, the sun, the moon, Matarisvan (wind), and the waters, the\nBrahmakarin places the firewood; the lights from these severally go into the\nclouds, from them come sacrificial butter, the purusha (primeval man), rain,\nand water.  \n14\\. Death is the teacher, (and) Varuna, Soma, the plants, milk; the clouds\nwere the warriors: by these this light has been brought hither.  \n15\\. Varuna, having become the teacher, at home prepares the ghee solely.\nWhatever he desired from Pragapati, that the Brahmakarin furnished, as Mitra\n(a friend) from his own Atman (spirit, or person).  \n16\\. The Brahmakarin is the teacher, the Brahmakarin Pragapati. Pragapati\nrules (shines forth, vi ragati); Virag (heavenly power, or light) became\nIndra, the ruler.  \n17\\. Through holy disciplehood. (brahmakaryam), through tapas (creative\nfervour), the king protects his kingdom. The teacher by (his own) brahmakaryam\n(holy life) seeks (finds) the Brahmakarin.  \n18\\. Through holy disciplehood the maiden obtains a young husband, through\nholy disciplehood the steer, the horse seeks to obtain fodder.  \n19\\. Through holy disciplehood, through creative fervour, the gods drove away\ndeath. Indrajorsooth, by his holy disciplehood brought the light to the gods.  \n20\\. The plants, that which was and shall be, day and night, the tree, the\nyear along with the seasons, have sprung from the Brahmakarin.  \n21\\. The earthly and the heavenly animals, the wild and the domestic, the\nwingless and the winged (animals), have sprung from the Brahmakarin.  \n22\\. All the creatures of Pragapati (the creator) severally carry breath in\ntheir souls. All these the brahma, which has been brought hither in the\nBrahmakarin, protects.  \n23\\. This, that was set into motion by the gods, that is insurmountable, that\nmoves shining, from it has sprung the brahmanam (Brahmanical life), the\nhighest brahma, and all the gods, together with immortality (amrita).  \n24, 25. The Brahmakarin carries the shining brahma: into this all the gods are\nwoven. Producing in-breathing and out-breathing, as well as through-breathing;\nspeech, mind, heart, brahma, and wisdom, do thou furnish us with sight,\nhearing, glory, food, semen, blood, and belly!  \n26\\. These things the Brahmakarin fashioned upon the back of the (heavenly)\nwater. He stood in the sea kindled with tapas (creative fervour). He, when he\nhas bathed, shines vigorously upon the earth, brown and ruddy.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 4. Prana, life or breath, personified as the supreme\nspirit](av211.htm)\n\n'
