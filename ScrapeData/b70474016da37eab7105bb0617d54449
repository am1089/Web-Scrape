I told this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvat; Vivasvat told it to Manu; (and)\nManu told it to Ikshvaku: 1\n\np. 97\n\n2\\. Thus handed down in regular succession, the royal sages knew it. This\nYoga, by long lapse of time, declined in this world, O burner of foes.\n\n3\\. I have this day told thee that same ancient Yoga, (for) thou art My\ndevotee, and My friend, and this secret is profound indeed. 3\n\np. 98\n\nArjuna said:\n\n4\\. Later was Thy birth, and that of Vivasvat prior; how then should I\nunderstand that Thou toldest this in the beginning?\n\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n\n5\\. Many are the births that have been passed by Me and thee, O Arjuna. I know\nthem all, whilst thou knowest not, O scorcher of foes.\n\np. 99\n\n6\\. Though I am unborn, of changeless nature and Lord of beings, yet\nsubjugating My Prakriti, I come into being by My own Maya. 6\n\n7\\. Whenever, O descendant of Bharata, there is decline of Dharma, and rise of\nAdharma, then I body Myself forth. 7\n\np. 100\n\n8\\. For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked, and for\nthe establishment of Dharma, I come into being in every age. 8\n\n9\\. He who thus knows, in true light, My divine birth and action, leaving the\nbody, is not born again: he attains to Me, O Arjuna. 9\n\np. 101\n\n10\\. Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in\nMe, purified by the fire of Knowledge, many have attained My Being. 10\n\np. 102\n\n11\\. In whatever way men worship Me, in the same way do I fulfil their\ndesires: (it is) My path, O son of Pritha, (that) men tread, in all ways. 11\n\n12\\. Longing for success in action, in this world, (men) worship the gods.\nBecause success, resulting from action, is, quickly attained in the human\nworld. 12\n\np. 103\n\n13\\. The fourfold caste was created by Me, by the differentiation of Guna and\nKarma. Though I am the author thereof, know Me to be the non-doer, and\nchangeless. 13\n\np. 104\n\n14\\. Actions do not taint Me, nor have I any thirst for the result of action.\nHe who knows Me thus is not fettered by action. 14\n\n15\\. Knowing thus, the ancient seekers after freedom also performed action. Do\nthou, therefore, perform action, as did the ancients in olden times. 15\n\np. 105\n\n16\\. Even sages are bewildered, as to what is action and what is inaction. I\nshall therefore tell you what action is, by knowing which you will be freed\nfrom evil. 16\n\n17\\. For verily, (the true nature) even of action (enjoined by the Shastras)\nshould\n\np. 106\n\nbe known, as also, (that) of forbidden action, and of inaction: the nature of\nKarma is impenetrable.\n\n18\\. He who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, he is intelligent\namong men, he is a Yogi and a doer of all action. 18\n\np. 107\n\n19\\. Whose undertakings are all devoid of plan and desire for results, and\nwhose actions are burnt by the fire of knowledge, him, the sages call wise. 19\n\n20\\. Forsaking the clinging to fruits of action, ever satisfied, depending on\nnothing, though engaged in action, he does not do anything.\n\np. 108\n\n21\\. Without hope, the body and mind controlled and all possessions\nrelinquished, he does not suffer any evil consequences, by doing mere bodily\naction. 21\n\n22\\. Content with what comes to him without effort, unaffected by the pairs of\nopposites, free from envy, even-minded in success and failure, though acting,\nhe is not bound.\n\np. 109\n\n23\\. Devoid of attachment, liberated, with mind centred in knowledge,\nperforming work for Yajna alone, his whole Karma dissolves away.\n\n24\\. The process is Brahman, the clarified butter is Brahman, offered by\nBrahman in the fire of Brahman; by seeing Brahman in action, he reaches\nBrahman alone. 24\n\np. 110\n\n25\\. Some Yogis perform sacrifices to Devas alone, while others offer the self\nas sacrifice by the self in the fire of Brahman alone. 25\n\n26\\. Some again offer hearing and other senses as sacrifice in the fire of\ncontrol, while others offer sound and other sense-objects as sacrifice in the\nfire of the senses. 26\n\np. 111\n\n27\\. Some again offer all the actions of the senses and the functions of the\nvital energy, as sacrifice in the fire of control in self, kindled by\nknowledge.\n\n28\\. Others again offer wealth, austerity, and Yoga, as sacrifice, while still\nothers, of self-restraint and rigid vows, offer study of the scriptures and\nknowledge, as sacrifice. 28\n\np. 112\n\n29\\. Yet some offer as sacrifice, the outgoing into the in-coming breath, and\nthe in-coming into the out-going, stopping the courses of the in-coming and\nout-going breaths, constantly practising the regulation of the vital energy;\nwhile others yet of regulated food, offer in the Pranas the functions thereof.\n29\n\np. 113\n\n30-31. All of these are knowers of Yajna, having their sins consumed by Yajna,\nand eating of the nectar--the remnant of Yajna, they go to the Eternal\nBrahman. (Even) this world is not for the non-performer of Yajna, how then\nanother, O best of the Kurus? 30\n\np. 114\n\n32\\. Various Yajnas, like the above, are strewn in the store-house of the\nVeda. Know them all to be born of action, and thus knowing, thou shalt be\nfree. 32\n\n33\\. Knowledge-sacrifice, O scorcher of foes, is superior to sacrifice\n(performed) with (material) objects. All action in its\n\np. 115\n\nentirety, O Partha, attains its consummation in knowledge.\n\n34\\. Know that, by prostrating thyself, by questions, and by service; the\nwise, those who have realised the Truth, will instruct thee in that knowledge.\n34\n\np. 116\n\n35\\. Knowing which, thou shalt not, O Pandava, again get deluded like this,\nand by which thou shalt see the whole of creation in (thy) Self and in Me. 35\n\n36\\. Even if thou be the most sinful among all the sinful, yet by the raft of\nknowledge alone thou shalt go across all sin.\n\n37\\. As blazing fire reduces wood into ashes, so, O Arjuna, does the fire of\nknowledge reduce all Karma to ashes. 37\n\np. 117\n\n38\\. Verily there exists nothing in this world purifying like knowledge. In\ngood time, having reached perfection in Yoga, one realises that oneself in\none's own heart.\n\n39\\. The man with Shraddha, the devoted, the master of one's senses, attains\n(this) knowledge. Having attained knowledge one goes at once to the Supreme\nPeace.\n\np. 118\n\n40\\. The ignorant, the man without Shraddha, the doubting self, goes to\ndestruction. The doubting self has neither this world, nor the next, nor\nhappiness. 40\n\np. 119\n\n41\\. With work renounced by Yoga and doubts rent asunder by knowledge, O\nDhananjaya, actions do not bind him who is poised in the Self.\n\n42\\. Therefore, cutting with the sword of knowledge, this doubt about the\nSelf, born of ignorance, residing in thy heart, take refuge in Yoga. Arise, O\nBharata!\n\nThe end of chapter four, designated The Way of Renunciation of Action in\nKnowledge.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[96:1](sbg09.htm#fr_90) _Vivasvat:_ the Sun. _Manu:_ the law-giver. Ikshvaku\nwas the famous ancestor of the Solar dynasty of Kshatriyas.\n\nThis Yoga is said to be imperishable, because the end attainable through it is\nimperishable.\n\n[97:3](sbg09.htm#fr_91) _Secret:_ Not as the privilege of an individual or a\nsect, but because of its profundity. It is a secret to the unworthy only.\n\n[99:6](sbg09.htm#fr_92) _Subjugating My Prakriti:_ He does not come into being\nas others do, bound by Karma, under the thraldom of Prakriti (Nature). He is\nnot tied by the fetters of the Gunas--because He is the Lord of Maya.\n\n_By My own M aya:_ My embodiment is only apparent grid does not touch My true\nnature.\n\n[99:7](sbg09.htm#fr_93) p. 100 The Dharma and its opposite Adharma imply all\nthe duties (and their opposites) as ordained for men in different stations by\nthe definite scheme of their life and salvation.\n\n[100:8](sbg09.htm#fr_94) _Destruction of the wicked:_ in order to destroy\ntheir wickedness, and give them life eternal.\n\n[100:9](sbg09.htm#fr_95) _He who knows &c.:_ He who knows the great truth,--\nthat the Lord though apparently born is ever beyond birth and death, though\napparently active in the cause of righteousness, is ever beyond all action,--\nbecomes illumined with Self-knowledge. Such a man is never born again.\n\n[101:10](sbg09.htm#fr_96) _Many have attained:_ The import is that the path of\nliberation here taught by Sri Krishna is not of recent origin, nor is it\ndependent upon His present manifestation, but has been handed down from time\nimmemorial.\n\n[102:11](sbg09.htm#fr_97) In this sloka Sri Krishna anticipates the objection\nthat God is partial to some and unkind to others, since He blesses some with\nSelf-knowledge and leaves the rest in darkness and misery. This difference is\nnot due to any difference in His attitude towards them, but is of their own\nchoice.\n\n_My path:_ In the whole region of thought and action, wherever there is\nfulfilment of object, no matter what, the same is due to the Lord. As the Self\nwithin, He brings to fruition all wishes, when the necessary conditions are\nfulfilled.\n\n[102:12](sbg09.htm#fr_98) p. 103 _Because success . . . human world:_ Worldly\nsuccess is much easier of attainment than Self-knowledge. Hence it is that the\nignorant do not go in for the latter.\n\n[103:13](sbg09.htm#fr_99) This sloka is intended to explain the diversity of\nhuman temperaments and tendencies. All men are not of the same nature, because\nof the preponderance of the different Gunas in them.\n\nThe caste system was originally meant to make perfect the growth of humanity,\nby the special culture of certain features, through the process of\ndiscriminate selection.\n\n_Though I am the author &c.:_ The Lord, though the author of the caste system,\nis yet not the author. The same dread of being taken as a doer or an agent\ncrops up again and again. The paradox is explained in Chap. IX. 5-10. Maya is\nthe real author, but p. 104 He is taken as such, because it is His light which\ngives existence, not only to all actions, but to Maya herself.\n\n[104:14](sbg09.htm#fr_100) _Actions do not taint Me:_ Karma cannot introduce\ninto Me anything foreign. I never depart from My true Self, which is All-\nfullness.\n\n[104:15](sbg09.htm#fr_101) p. 105 _Knowing thus:_ Taking this point of view,\nthat is, that the Self can have no desire for the fruits of action and cannot\nbe soiled by action.\n\n[105:16](sbg09.htm#fr_102) _Evil:_ the evil of existence, the wheel of birth\nand death.\n\n[106:18](sbg09.htm#fr_103) An action is an action so long as the idea of\nactor-ness of the Self holds good. Directly the idea of actor-ness disappears,\nno matter what or how much is done, action has lost its nature. It has become\nharmless: it can no longer bind. On the other hand, how much soever inactive\nan ignorant person may remain, so long as there is the idea of actor-ness in\nhim, he is constantly doing action. Action equals to belief in the actor-ness\nof oneself and inaction its reverse.\n\n_He is the doer of all action:_ He has achieved the end of all action, which\nis freedom.\n\n[107:19](sbg09.htm#fr_104) _Whose undertakings &c.:_ Who is devoid of egoism.\n\n[108:21](sbg09.htm#fr_105) _Evil consequences:_ resulting from good and bad\nactions, for both lead to bondage.\n\n[109:24](sbg09.htm#fr_106) How can the whole Karma of a person engaged in work\nmelt away as stated here? Because after knowledge, his whole life becomes one\nact of Yajna, in which the process of oblation, the offering, the fire, the\ndoer of the sacrifice, the work, and the goal, are all Brahman. Since his\nKarma produces no other result than the attainment of Brahman, his Karma is\nsaid to melt away.\n\n[110:25](sbg09.htm#fr_107) _Others offer &c.:_ The sacrifice referred to here,\nis, divesting the Self of Its Upadhis (limiting adjuncts), so that It is found\nto be the Self.\n\n[110:26](sbg09.htm#fr_108) _Others offer sound &c.:_ Others direct their\nsenses towards pure and unforbidden objects, and in so doing regard themselves\nas performing acts of sacrifice.\n\n[111:28](sbg09.htm#fr_109) _Offer Yoga as sacrifice:_ Practise the eightfold\nYoga as an act of sacrifice.\n\n[112:29](sbg09.htm#fr_110) _Offer in the Pr anas the functions thereof:_\nWhatever Prana has been controlled, into it they sacrifice all other Pranas;\nthese latter become, as it were, merged in the former. Or, in another way:\nThey control the different Pranas and unify them by the foregoing method; the\nsenses are thus attenuated and are merged in the unified Prana, as an act of\nsacrifice. p. 113\n\nAll the various acts described in verses 25 to 29, as offerings of sacrifice,\nare only conceived as such, the study of the scriptures is regarded as an act\nof sacrifice, and so on.\n\n[113:30](sbg09.htm#fr_111) _They go to the Eternal Brahman:_ in course of\ntime, after attaining knowledge through purification of heart.\n\n_Even this world is not for the non-performer of Yajna:_ this means,--he that\ndoes not perform any p. 114 of the Yajnas above mentioned, is not fit even for\nthis wretched human world,--how then could he hope to gain a better world than\nthis?\n\n[114:32](sbg09.htm#fr_112) _Strewn in the store-house of the Veda:_ inculcated\nby or known through the Veda.\n\n[115:34](sbg09.htm#fr_113) Prostration before the Guru, questions and personal\nservices to him, constitute discipleship.\n\n_Those who have realised the Truth:_ mere theoretical knowledge, however\nperfect, does not qualify a person to be a Guru: the Truth, or Brahman, must\nbe realised, before one can claim that most elevated position.\n\n[116:35](sbg09.htm#fr_114) _Which:_ the knowledge referred to in the preceding\nsloka to be learnt from the Guru.\n\n[116:37](sbg09.htm#fr_115) p. 117 Excepting of course the Prarabdha, or Karma\nwhich, causing the present body, has begun to bear fruits.\n\n[118:40](sbg09.htm#fr_116) _The ignorant:_ one who knows not the Self.\n\n_The man without Shraddh a:_ one who has no faith in the words and teachings\nof his Guru.\n\n_The doubting self has &c.:_ One of a doubting disposition fails to enjoy this\nworld, owing to his constantly rising suspicion about the people, and things\naround him, and is also full of doubt as regards the next world; so do the\nignorant and the man without Shraddha.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fifth Chapter.
