But when he came to the sissoo tree, he was surprised to see a great\nmany bodies hanging on the tree. They were all alike, and in each was a goblin\ntwitching its limbs.\n\nAnd the king thought: "Ah, what does this mean? Why does that magic goblin\nkeep wasting my time? For I do not know which of all these I ought to take. If\nI should not succeed in this night\'s endeavour, then I would burn myself alive\nrather than become a laughing-stock."\n\nBut the goblin understood the king\'s purpose, and was pleased with his\ncharacter. So he gave up his magic arts. Then the king saw only one goblin in\none body. He took him down as before, put him on his shoulder, and started\nonce more.\n\nAnd as he walked along, the goblin said: "O King, if you have no objections, I\nwill tell you a story. Listen."\n\n\n\nThere is a city called Ujjain, whose people delight in noble happiness, and\nfeel no longing for heaven. In that city there is real darkness at night, real\nintelligence in poetry, real madness in elephants, real coolness in pearls,\nsandal, and moonlight.\n\nThere lived a king named Moonshine. He had as counsellor a famous Brahman\nnamed Heaven-lord, rich in money, rich in piety, rich in learning. And the\ncounsellor had a son named Moon-lord.\n\nThis son went one day to a great resort of gamblers to play. There the dice,\nbeautiful as the eyes of gazelles, were being thrown constantly. And Calamity\nseemed to be looking on, thinking: "Whom shall I embrace?" And the loud shouts\nof angry gamblers seemed to suggest the question: "Who is there that would not\nbe fleeced here, were he the god of wealth himself?"\n\nThis hall the youth entered, and played with dice. He staked his clothes and\neverything else, and the gamblers won it all. Then he wagered money he did not\nhave, and lost that. And when they asked him to pay, he could not. So the\ngambling-master caught him and beat him with clubs.\n\nWhen he was bruised all over by the clubs, the Brahman youth became motionless\nlike a stone, and pretended to be dead, and waited. After he had lain thus for\ntwo or three days, the heartless gambling-master said to the gamblers: "He\nlies like a stone. Take him somewhere and throw him into a blind well. I will\npay you the money he owes."\n\nSo the gamblers picked Moon-lord up and went far into the forest, looking for\na well. Then one old gambler said to the others: "He is as good as dead. What\nis the use of throwing him into a well now? We will leave him here and go back\nand say we have left him in a well." And all the rest agreed, and left him\nthere, and went back.\n\nWhen they were gone, Moon-lord rose and entered a deserted temple to Shiva.\nWhen he had rested a little there, he thought in great anguish: "Ah, I trusted\nthe rascally gamblers, and they cheated me. Where shall I go now, naked and\ndusty as I am? What would my father say if he saw me now, or any relative, or\nany friend? I will stay here for the present, and at night I will go out and\ntry to find food somehow to appease my hunger."\n\nWhile he reflected in weariness and nakedness, the sun grew less hot and\ndisappeared. Then a terrible hermit named Stake came there, and he had smeared\nhis body with ashes. When he had seen Moon-lord and asked who he was and heard\nhis story, he said, as the youth bent low before him: "Sir, you have come to\nmy hermitage, a guest fainting with hunger. Rise, bathe, and partake of the\nmeal I have gained by begging."\n\nThen Moon-lord said to him: "Holy sir, I am a Brahman. How can I partake of\nsuch a meal?"\n\nThen the hermit-magician went into his hut and out of tenderness to his guest\nhe thought of a magic spell which grants all desires. And the spell appeared\nin bodily form, and said: "What shall I do?" And the hermit said: "Treat that\nman as an honoured guest."\n\nThen Moon-lord was astonished to see a golden palace rise before him and a\ngrove with women in it. They came to him from the palace and said: "Sir, rise,\ncome, bathe, eat, and meet our mistress." So they led him in and gave him a\nchance to bathe and anoint himself and dress. Then they led him to another\nroom.\n\nThere the youth saw a woman of wonderful beauty, whom the Creator must have\nmade to see what he could do. She rose and offered him half of her seat. And\nhe ate heavenly food and various fruits and chewed betel leaves and sat\nhappily with her on the couch.\n\nIn the morning he awoke and saw the temple to Shiva, but the heavenly creature\nwas gone, and the palace, and the women in it.  So he went out in distress,\nand the hermit in his hut smiled and asked him how he had spent the night. And\nhe said: "Holy sir, through your kindness I spent a happy night, but I shall\ndie without that heavenly creature."\n\nThen the hermit laughed and said: "Stay here. You shall have the same\nhappiness again to-night." So Moon-lord enjoyed those delights every night\nthrough the favour of the hermit.\n\nFinally Moon-lord came to see what a mighty spell that was. So, driven on by\nhis fate, he respectfully begged the hermit: "Holy sir, if you really feel\npity for a poor suppliant like me, teach me that spell which has such power."\n\nAnd when he insisted, the hermit said: "You could never win the spell. One has\nto stand in the water to win it. And it weaves a net of magic to bewilder the\nman who is repeating the words, so that he cannot win it. For as he mumbles\nit, he seems to lead another life, first a baby, then a boy, then a youth,\nthen a husband, then a father. And he falsely imagines that such and such\npeople are his friends, such and such his enemies. He forgets his real life\nand his desire to win the spell. But if a man mumbles it constantly for\ntwenty-four years, and remembers his own life, and is not deceived by the\nnetwork of magic, and then at the end burns himself alive, he comes out of the\nwater, and has real magic power. It comes only to a good pupil, and if a\nteacher tries to teach it to a bad pupil, the teacher loses it too. Now you\nhave the real benefit through my magic power. Why insist on more? If I lost my\npowers, then your happiness would go too."\n\nBut Moon-lord said: "I can do anything. Do not fear, holy sir." And the hermit\npromised to teach him the spell. What will holy men not do out of regard to\nthose who seek aid?\n\nSo the hermit went to the river bank, and said: "My son, mumble the words of\nthe spell. And while you are leading an imaginary life, you will at last be\nawakened by my magic. Then plunge into the magic fire which you will see. I\nwill stand here on the bank while you mumble it."\n\nSo he purified himself and purified Moon-lord and made him sip water, and then\nhe taught him the magic spell. And Moon-lord bowed to his teacher on the bank,\nand plunged into the river.\n\nAnd as he mumbled the words of the spell in the water, he was bewildered by\nits magic. He forgot all about his past life, and went through another life.\nHe was born in another city as the son of a Brahman. Then he grew up, was\nconsecrated, and went to school. Then he took a wife, and after many\nexperiences half pleasant, half painful, he found himself the father of a\nfamily. Then he lived for some years with his parents and his relatives,\ndevoted to wife and children, and interested in many things.\n\nWhile he was experiencing all these labours of another life, the hermit took\npity on him and repeated magic words to enlighten him. And Moon-lord was\nenlightened in the midst of his new life. He remembered himself and his\nteacher, and saw that the other life was a network of magic. So he prepared to\nenter the fire in order to win magic power.\n\nBut older people and reliable people and his parents and his relatives tried\nto prevent him. In spite of them he hankered after heavenly pleasures, and\nwent to the bank of a river where a funeral pile had been made ready. And his\nrelatives went with him. But when he got there he saw that his old parents and\nhis wife and his little children were weeping.\n\nAnd he was perplexed, and thought: "Alas! If I enter the fire, all these my\nown people will die. And I do not know whether my teacher\'s promise will come\ntrue or not. Shall I go into the fire, or go home? No, no. How could a teacher\nwith such powers promise falsely? Indeed, I must enter the fire." And he did.\n\nAnd he was astonished the feel the fire as cool as snow, and lost his fear of\nit. Then he came out of the water of the river, and found himself on the bank.\nHe saw his teacher standing there, and fell at his feet, and told him the\nwhole story, ending with the blazing funeral pile.\n\nThen his teacher said: "My son, I think you must have made some mistake.\nOtherwise, why did the fire seem cool to you? That never happens in the\nwinning of this magic spell."\n\nAnd Moon-lord said: "Holy sir, I do not remember making any mistake." Then his\nteacher was eager to know about it, so he tried to remember the spell himself.\nBut it would not come to him or to his pupil. So they went away sad, having\nlost their magic.\n\n\n\nWhen the goblin had told this story, he asked the king: "O King, explain the\nmatter to me. Why did they lose their magic, when everything had been done\naccording to precept?"\n\nThen the king said: "O magic creature, I see that you are only trying to waste\nmy time. Still, I will tell you. Magic powers do not come to a man because he\ndoes things that are hard, but because he does things with a pure heart. The\nBrahman youth was defective at that point. He hesitated even when his mind was\nenlightened. Therefore he failed to win the magic. And the teacher lost his\nmagic because he taught it to an unworthy pupil."\n\nThen the goblin went back to his home. And the king ran to find him, never\nhesitating.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Eighteenth Goblin: The Boy whom his Parents, the King, and the Giant\nconspired to Kill.
