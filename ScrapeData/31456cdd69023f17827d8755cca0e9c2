The king said :-- \xc2\x93Lord! You have described fully the glory of the Maha\nMaya Yoges'vari; now describe Her Life and Character; I am very eager to hear\nthem. This whole universe, moving and nonmoving, has been created by\nMahes'vari; who is there that desires not to hear Her Glory!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n3-7. Vyasa spoke :-- O king! You are very intelligent; I will describe in\ndetail all this to you; whoever does not describe Her Glory to the peaceful\nand faithful, is certainly low-minded? In days of yore, a terrible battle\nensued between the Devas and Danava forces on this earth when Mahi _s_ asura\nwas the Ruler of this world. O king! Mahi _s_ asura went to the mountain of\nSumeru and performed a very severe and excellent tapasya, wonderful even to\nthe gods. O king! Meditating on his Ista Devata (the deity for his worship) in\nhis heart, elapsed full ten thousand years, when Brahma the Grandfather of all\nthe Lokas, was pleased with him. The fourfaced Brahma, arrived there on his\nvehicle the swan, asked Mahi _s_ asura \xc2\x93O One of virtuous soul! Ask from me\nwhat is your desired object; I will grant thee boon.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n8\\. Mahi _s_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord, Lotus-eyed! I want to become immortal!\ntherefore O Thou, the Grandfather of the Devas! Dost thou do for me so that I\nhave no fear of death.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n9-11. Brahma said :-- \xc2\x93O Mahi _s_ a! Birth must be followed by death, and\ndeath must be followed by birth; this is the eternal law of nature. Then know\nthis as certain that when one is born, one must die; and when one dies, one\nwill be born. O Lord of the Danavas! What more to say than this, that high\nmountains, vast oceans, and all the beings will die when time will come. O\nRuler of the earth! You are virtuous; therefore ask any other boon than this\nimmortality; I will grant that to you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n12-13. Mahi _s_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Grand Sire! Grant, then, that no Deva, Danava,\nnor human being of the male sex can cause my death. There is none among women\nwho can cause my death. Therefore, O Lotus-eyed! Let woman be the cause of my\ndeath; how can women slay me! The are too weak to kill me!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n14\\. Brahma said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord of the Danavas! Your death will certainly occur,\nat any time, through a woman; O Highly Fortunate One! No man will be able to\ncause your death.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 358\n\n\n\n15\\. Vyasa said :-- Thus granting him the boon, Brahma went to his own abode;\nthe lord of the Danavas, too, returned to his place, very glad.\n\n\n\n16\\. The king said :-- \xc2\x93O Bhagavan! Whose son was this powerful Mahi _s_\nasura; how his birth took place? and why, too, did he get a body of a\nbuffalo?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n17-26. Vyasa said :-- O king! Rambha and Karambha were the two sons of Danu;\nthese two Danavas were far famed in this world for their pre-eminence. O king!\nThey had no issues; hence, desirous of issues, they went to the sacred banks\nof the Indus (Pa\xc3\xb1cha Nada) and there performed severe asceticism for long\nyears. Karambha got himself submerged in water and thus began his severe\ntapasya; while the other, Rambha, had recourse to a juicy peepul tree (haunted\nby Yakshinis) and there began to worship Fire. Rambha remained, engaged in\nworshipping the Five Fires; knowing this, Indra, the Lord of S'achi, was\npained and hurried thither, being very anxious. Going to Pa\xc3\xb1cha Nada, Indra\nassumed the form of a crocodile and caught hold of the legs of the wicked\nKarambha and killed him. Hearing of the death of his brother, Rambha got very\nmuch enraged and wishing to offer his own head as an oblation to the Fire, he\nwanted to cut off his own head; he, being infuriated, held the hairs of his\nhead by his left hand, and, catching hold of a good axe, by his right hand,\nwas on the point of cutting it, when the Fire gave him knowledge, desisted him\nfrom this act and spoke thus :-- You are stupid; why have you desired to cut\noff your own head; killing one's ownself is a great sin; and there is no means\nof deliverance from this sin. Why are you then ready to execute it? Do not\nseek your death now; what end will that serve you? Rather ask boons from me;\nthus you will get your welfare.\n\n\n\n27-31. Vyasa said :-- O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of Fire, Rambha\nquitted the hold of his hairs and said :-- O Lord of the Devas! If thou art\npleased, grant my desired boon that a son be born unto me, who will destroy\nthe forces of my enemy and who will conquer the three worlds. And that son be\ninvincible in every way by the Devas, Danavas and men, very powerful, assuming\nforms at will, and respected by all. The Fire said :-- O highly Fortunate! You\nwill get your son, as you desire; therefore desist now from your attempting\nsuicide. O highly fortunate Rambha! With any female of whichever species, you\nwill co-habit, you will get a son, more powerful than you; there is no doubt\nin this.\n\n\n\np. 359\n\n\n\n32-50. Vyasa said :-- O king! Hearing thus the sweet words of the Fire as\ndesired, Rambha, the chief of the Danavas, went, surrounded by Yaksas, to a\nbeautiful place, adorned with picturesque sceneries; when one lovely she-\nbuffalo, who was very maddened with passion, fell to the sight of Rambha. And\nhe desired to have sexual intercourse with her, in preference to other women.\nThe she-buffallo, too, gladly yielded to his purpose and Rambha had sexual\nintercourse with her, impelled as it were by the destiny. The she-buffalo\nbecame pregnant with his semen virile. The Danava, too, carried the she-\nbuffalo, his dear wife, to Patala (the lower regions) for her protection. On\none occasion, another buffalo got excited and wanted to fall upon the she-\nbuffalo. The Danava was also ready to kill him. The Danava came hurriedly and\nstruck the buffalo for the safety of his wife; whereon the excited buffalo\nattacked him with his horns. The buffalo struck him so violently with his\nsharp horns that Rambha fell down senseless all on a sudden and finally died.\nSeeing her husband dead, the she-buffalo quickly fled away in distress and,\nwith terror, she quickly went to the peepul tree and took refuge under the\nYaksas. But that buffalo, excited very much and maddened with vigour, ran in\npursuit of her, desiring intercourse with her. On seeing the miserable plight\nof the weeping she-buffalo, distressed with fear, and seeing the buffalo in\npursuit of her, the Yaksas assembled to protect her. A terrible fight ensued\nbetween the buffalo and the Yaksas, when the buffalo, shot with arrows by\nthem, fell down and died. Rambha was very much liked by the Yaksas; so they\ncremated his dead body for its purification. The she-buffalo, seeing her\nhusband laid in the funeral pyre, expressed her desire to enter also into that\nfire. The Yaksas resisted; but that chaste wife quickly entered into the\nburning fire along with her husband. When the she-buffalo died, the powerful\nMahi _s_ a rose from his mother's womb from the midst of the funeral pyre;\nRambha, too, emerged from the fire in another form out of his affection\ntowards his son. Rambha was known as Raktavija after he had changed his form.\nHis son was thus born as a very powerful Danava and became famous by the name\nof Mahi _s_ a. The chief Danavas installed Mahi _s_ a on the throne. O king!\nThe very powerful Raktavija and the Danava Mahi _s_ a, thus took their births\nand became invincible of the Devas, Danavas and human beings. O king! I have\nnow described to you the birth of the highsouled Danava Mahi _s_ a and his\ngetting the boon, all in detail.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Second Chapter of the Fifth Book on the birth of Mahi _s_ a\nDanava in the Devi Bhagavatam, the Mahapura _n_ am composed of 18,000 verses\nby Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 3](bk05ch03.htm)\n\n"
