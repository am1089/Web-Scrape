Now I will speak how to count the Japam\n(repetition of the mantra) with the rosary. Hear. The face of Rudrak _s_ am is\nBrahma; the upper summit point is S\xc2\x92iva and the tail end of Rudrak _s_ am is\nVi _sn_ u. The Rudrak _s_ am has two-fold powers :-- It can give Bhoga\n(Enjoyment) as well as Mok _s_ a (Liberation). Then string or tie together,\nlike a cow's tail, and like the snake's coiling a body, twenty-five five faced\nRudrak _s_ a seeds, thorny and of red, white, mixed colours bored through and\nthrough. The rosary is to taper as a cow's tail tapers down. In stringing the\nbeads into a rosary, it should be seen that the flat face of one Rudrak _s_ am\nis in front of the flat face of another Rudrak _s_ am; so the tail, the\npointed end of one, must come in front of the tail or the narrower end of\nanother. The Meru or the topmost bead of the string must have its face turned\nupwards and the knot should be given over that. The rosary, thus strung,\nyields success of the Mantra (mantra-siddhi). When the rosary is strung, it is\nto be bathed with clear and scented water and afterwards with the Pa\xc3\xb1chagavya\n(cow-dung, cow urine, curd, milk, and ghee); then wash it with clear water and\nsanctify it with the condensed electrical charge of the Mantra. Then recite\nthe Mantra of S\xc2\x92iva (Six limbed), with \xc2\x93Hum\xc2\x94 added and collect the rosaries.\nThen repeat over them the Mantra \xc2\x93Sadyojata, etc.\xc2\x94, and sprinkle water over it\none hundred and eight times. Then utter the principal mantra and place them on\na holy ground and perform Nyasa over it, i.e., think that the Great Cause\nS\xc2\x92iva and the World-Mother Bhagavati have come on them. Thus make the Samskara\nof the rosary (i.e., purify it) and you will find then that your desired end\nwill be attained successfully. Worship the rosary with the Mantra of that\nDevata for which it is intended. One is to wear the Rudrak _s_ a rosary on\none's head, neck or ear and controlling oneself, one should make japam with\nthe rosary. On the neck, head, breast, or the ears or on the arms, the rosary\nshould he held with the greatest devotion. What is the use in saying about it\nso often? It is highly meritorious and commendable\n\n\n\np. 1068\n\n\n\nto hold always the Rudrak _s_ am. Especially on such occasions as taking\nbaths, making gifts, making japams, performing the Homas,or sacrifices to Vi\n_s_ ve Devas, in performing the Poojas of the Devas,in making Prayaschittams\n(penances), in the time of S\xc2\x92radh and in the time of initiation, it is highly\nnecessary to hold Rudrak _s_ am. A Brahmi _n_ is sure to go to hell if he\nperforms any Vaidik act without wearing any Rudrak _s_ am. Note :-- It would\nbe offering an insult to S\xc2\x92iva!\n\n\n\n15-29. It is advisable to use the true Rudrak _s_ am with gold and jewel, on\nthe head, neck or on one's hand. Never use the Rudrak _s_ am worn by another.\nUse Rudrak _s_ am always with devotion; never use it while you are impure.\nEven the grass that grows with the air in contact with the Rudrak _s_ a tree,\ngoes verily to a holy region for ever. Jabala Muni says in the S\xc2\x92ruti :-- lf a\nman wearing Rudrak _s_ am commits a sin, he gets deliverance from that sin.\nEven if animals hold Rudrak _s_ am, they become S\xc2\x92iva; what of men! The\ndevotees of S\xc2\x92ri Rudra should always use at least one Rudrak _s_ a on the\nhead. Those great devotees, who with Rudrak _s_ am on take the name of the\nHighest Self S\xc2\x92ambhu, get themselves freed of all sorts of sins and pains.\nThose who are ornamented with Rudrak _s_ am are the best devotees. It is\nhighly incumbent on those who want their welfare to wear Rudrak _s_ am. Those\nwho hold Rudrak _s_ am on their ears, crown hair, neck, hands, and breast, get\nBrahma, Vi _sn_ u, and Mahes'vara under them as their Vibhutis\n(manifestations, powers). The Devas and all those Ri _s_ is that started the\nGotra, the \xc3\x82dipuru _s_ as (the first chief men in several families), held with\nreverence the Rudrak _s_ ams. All the other Munis, that descended from their\nfamilies, the ardent followers of S\xc2\x92rauta Dharma, the pure souled, held the\nRudrak _s_ ams. It may be, that many might not like at first to hold this\nRudrak _s_ am, the visible giver of liberation and so well written in the\nVedas; but after many births, out of the Grace of Mahadeva many become eager\nto take the Rudrak _s_ ams. The Munis that are the Jabala Sakhis are famous in\nexpounding the inestimable greatness of Rudrak _s_ ams.\n\n\n\nThe effect of holding Rudrak _s_ ams is well known in the three worlds. Pu _n_\nyam (great merit) arises from the mere sight of Rudrak _s_ ams; ten million\ntimes that merit arises by its touch; and by wearing it, one hundred Ko _t_ i\ntimes the fruit arises and if one makes Japam every day, then one lakh ko _t_\ni times the pu _n_ yam arises. There is no manner of questionings in this.\n\n\n\np. 1069\n\n\n\n30-36. He who holds in his hand, breast, neck, ears, head, the Rudrak _s_ ams,\nbecomes an image of Rudra. There is no manner of doubt in this. By holding\nRudrak _s_ ams, men become invulnerable of all the beings, become respected,\nlike Maha Deva, by the Devas and Asuras and they roam on the earth like Rudra.\nEven if a man be addicted to evil deeds and commits all sorts of sins, he\nbecomes respected by all, on holding Rudrak _s_ ams. By this men are freed of\nthe sin of taking Uchhi _st_ a and of all the other sins. Even if you suspend\na Rudrak _s_ am rosary on the neck of a dog and if that dog dies in that\nstate, he gets liberation! Then what to speak of others! By holding Rudrak _s_\nams, men even if they be devoid of Japam and Dhyanam, become freed of all sins\nand attain the highest state. Even if one holds merely one Rudrak _s_ a seed\npurified and surcharged with Mantra S\xc2\x92akti, he uplifts his twentyone\ngenerations, gets to Heaven and resides there with respect. I am speaking now\nfurther of the Greatness of Rudrak _s_ am.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the Rudrak _s_ am rosaries\nin the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_\ni Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 6](bk11ch06.htm)\n\n"
