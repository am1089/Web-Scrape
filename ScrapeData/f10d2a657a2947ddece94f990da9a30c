Speech (is merged) in mind, on account of this being seen, and of the\nscriptural statement.\n\nBeing about to describe the path of the gods which leads those who possess the\nlower kind of knowledge towards the attainment of their reward, the Sutrakara\nbegins by explaining, on the basis of scriptural statements, the successive\nsteps by which the soul passes out of the body; for, as will be stated later\non, the departure of the soul is the same in the case of him who possesses the\n(lower) knowledge and of him who is devoid of all knowledge.\n\nAbout the process of dying we have the following passage, 'When a man departs\nfrom hence his speech merges in his mind, his mind in his breath, his breath\nin fire, fire in the highest deity' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 6, 1). A doubt here arises\nwhether the passage means to say that speech itself, together with its\nfunction, is merged in the mind, or only the function of speech.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that speech itself is merged in the mind. For this\nexplanation only is in agreement with the direct statement of the sacred text,\nwhile the other alternative compels us to have recourse to an implied meaning;\nnow wherever direct enunciation and implied meaning are in conflict the\npreference has to be given to the former, and we therefore maintain that\nspeech itself is merged in the mind.\n\nTo this we reply that only the function of speech is merged in the mind.--But\nhow can this interpretation be maintained, considering that the teacher (in\nthe Sutra) expressly says 'Speech in the mind?'--True we reply; but later on\nhe says 'There is non-division, according to scriptural statement' (Sutra 16),\nand we therefrom conclude that what is meant in the present Sutra is merely\ncessation of the function of speech. For if the intention were to\n\np. 365\n\nexpress absorption of the thing (i.e. the organ of speech) itself, there would\nbe 'non-division' in all cases, and for what reason then should 'non-division'\nbe specially stated in another case (i.e. in the case of which Sutra 16\ntreats)? The meaning therefore is that the different functions are retracted,\nand that while the function of the mind continues to go on the function of\nspeech is retracted first.--Why so?--'Because this is seen.' It is a matter of\nobservation that while the mind continues to act the function of speech comes\nto an end; nobody, on the other hand, is able to see that the organ of speech\nitself, together with its function, is merged in the mind.--But are we not\njustified in assuming such a merging of speech in the mind, on the ground of\nscriptural statement?--This is impossible, we reply, since mind is not the\ncausal substance of speech. We are entitled to assume only that a thing is\nmerged in what is its causal substance; a pot e.g. (when destroyed) is merged\nin clay. But there is no proof whatever for speech originating from mind. On\nthe other hand we observe that functions originate and are retracted even\nwhere they do not inhere in causal substances. The function of fire, e.g.\nwhich is of the nature of heat, springs from fuel which is of the nature of\nearth, and it is extinguished in water.--But how do you, on this\ninterpretation, account for the scriptural statement that 'speech is merged in\nthe mind?'--'And on account of the scriptural statement,' the Sutrakara\nreplies. The scriptural statement also may be reconciled with our\ninterpretation, in so far as the function and the thing to which the function\nbelongs are viewed as non-different.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 2](sbe38282.htm)\n\n"
