Matsya Puran\xcc\x81a. "That in which, for the sake of promulgating the Vedas,\nVishn\xcc\x81u, in the beginning of a Kalpa, related to Manu the story of Narasinha\nand the events of seven Kalpas, that, O sages, know to be the Matsya Puran\xcc\x81a,\ncontaining twenty thousand stanzas 78."\n\nWe might, it is to be supposed, admit the description which the Matsya gives\nof itself to be correct, and yet as regards the number of verses there seems\nto be a mistatement. Three very good copies, one in my possession, one in the\nCompany\'s library, and one in the Radcliffe library, concur in all respects,\nand in containing no more than between fourteen and fifteen thousand stanzas:\nin this case the Bhagavata is nearer the truth, when it assigns to it fourteen\nthousand. We may conclude, therefore, that the reading of the passage is in\nthis respect erroneous. It is correctly said that the subjects of the Puran\xcc\x81a\nwere communicated by Vishn\xcc\x81u, in the form of a fish, to Manu.\n\nThe Puran\xcc\x81a, after the usual prologue of Suta and the Rishis, opens with the\naccount of the Matsya or \'fish\' Avatara of Vishn\xcc\x81u, in which he preserves a\nking named Manu, with the seeds of all things, in an ark, from the waters of\nthat inundation which in the season of a Pralaya overspreads the world. This\nstory is told in the Mahabharata, with reference to the Matsya as its\nauthority; from which it might be inferred that the Puran\xcc\x81a was prior to the\npoem. This of course is consistent with the tradition that the Puran\xcc\x81as were\nfirst composed by Vyasa; but there can be no doubt that the greater part of\nthe Mahabharata is much older than any extant Puran\xcc\x81a. The present instance is\nitself a proof; for the primitive simplicity with which the story of the fish\nAvatara is told in the Mahabharata is of a much more antique complexion than\nthe mysticism and extravagance of the actual Matsya Puran\xcc\x81a. In the former,\nManu collects the seeds of existing things in the ark, it is not said how: in\nthe latter, he brings them all together by the power of Yoga.\n\np. lii\n\n[paragraph continues] In the latter, the great serpents come to the king, to\nserve as cords wherewith to fasten the ark to the horn of the fish: in the\nformer, a cable made of ropes is more intelligibly employed for the purpose.\n\nWhilst the ark floats, fastened to the fish, Manu enters into conversation\nwith him; and his questions, and the replies of Vishn\xcc\x81u, form the main\nsubstance of the compilation. The first subject is the creation, which is that\nof Brahma and the patriarchs. Some of the details are the usual ones; others\nare peculiar, especially those relating to the Pitris, or progenitors. The\nregal dynasties are next described; and then follow chapters on the duties of\nthe different orders. It is in relating those of the householder, in which the\nduty of making gifts to Brahmans is comprehended, that we have the\nspecification of the extent and subjects of the Puran\xcc\x81as. It is meritorious to\nhave copies made of them, and to give these away on particular occasions. Thus\nit is said of the Matsya; "Whoever gives it away at either equinox, along with\na golden fish and a milch cow, gives away the whole earth;" that is, he reaps\na like reward in his next migration. Special duties of the householder--\nVratas, or occasional acts of piety--are then described at considerable\nlength, with legendary illustrations. The account of the universe is given in\nthe usual strain. \xc5\x9aaiva legends ensue; as, the destruction of Tripurasura; the\nwar of the gods with Taraka and the Daityas, and the consequent birth of\nKartikeya, with the various circumstances of Uma\'s birth and marriage, the\nburning of Kamadeva, and other events involved in that narrative; the\ndestruction of the Asuras Maya and Andhaka; the origin of the Matris, and the\nlike; interspersed with the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava legends of the Avataras. Some Mahatmyas\nare also introduced; one of which, the Narmada Mahatmya, contains some\ninteresting particulars. There are various chapters on law and morals; and one\nwhich furnishes directions for building houses, and making images. We then\nhave an account of the kings of future periods; and the Puran\xcc\x81a concludes with\na chapter on gifts.\n\nThe Matsya Puran\xcc\x81a, it will be seen even from this brief sketch of its\ncontents, is a miscellaneous compilation, but including in its contents the\nelements of a genuine Puran\xcc\x81a. At the same time it is of too mixed a\n\np. liii\n\ncharacter to be considered as a genuine work of the Pauran\xcc\x81ik class; and upon\nexamining it carefully, it may be suspected that it is indebted to various\nworks, not only for its matter, but for its words. The genealogical and\nhistorical chapters are much the same as those of the Vishn\xcc\x81u; and many\nchapters, as those on the Pitris and Sraddhas, are precisely the same as those\nof the Srisht\xcc\x81i Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a of the Padma Puran\xcc\x81a. It has drawn largely also from\nthe Mahabharata: amongst other instances, it is sufficient to quote the story\nof Savitri, the devoted wife of Satyavat, which is given in the Matsya in the\nsame manner, but considerably abridged.\n\nAlthough a \xc5\x9aaiva work, it is not exclusively so, and it has no such sectarial\nabsurdities as the Kurma and Linga. It is a composition of considerable\ninterest; but if it has extracted its materials from the Padma, which it also\nquotes on one occasion, the specification of the Upa-puran\xcc\x81as, it is\nsubsequent to that work, and therefore not very ancient.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[li:78](vp020.htm#fr_77) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_05100.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 17.
