D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 112\n\n**BIBLIOGRAPHY**\n\nThe beginner will find the following works useful:\n\nSacred Books of the East, edited by F. Max Muller: vol. 1 & 15, Upanishads,\ntranslated by F. Max M\xc5\xabller; vol. .34, Ved\xc4\x81nta-s\xc5\xabtra (i.e. Brahma-s\xc5\xabtra) with\nthe commentary by \xc5\x9aankara, translated by G. Thibaut. _Oxford, Clarendon\nPress,_ 1879, etc.\n\nPhilosophy of the Upanishads, by A. E. Gough. _London, Tr ubner,_ 1882.\n\nThe Upanishads (in Sanskrit and English) and \xc5\x9aankara\'s commentary (in\nEnglish), translated by S\xc4\xabt\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ma \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stri and Gang\xc4\x81n\xc4\x81tha Jh\xc4\x81. _Madras,_\n_Seshachari_ , 1898, etc.\n\nSechzig Upanishads des Veda, ubersetzt von Dr. Paul Deussen. _Leipzig,\nBrockhaus,_ 1897\n\nThe Philosophy of the Upanishads, by Paul Deussen. Translated by Rev. A.\nGeden. _Edinburgh, T. & T. Clark,_ 1906.\n\nDas System des Vedanta, von P. Deussen. _Leipzig, Brockhaus,_ 1883.\n\nThe Six Systems of Indian Philosophy, by F. Max Muller. _London, Longmans,_\n1899.\n\nOf the numerous compendia of the later Ved\xc4\x81nta we may mention two which have\nbeen published in English--the Ved\xc4\x81nta-s\xc4\x81ra of Sad\xc4\x81nanda, translated under the\ntitle "A Manual of Hindu Pantheism" by Col. G. A. Jacob ( _London, Tr ubner,_\n1881), and the Advaita-makaranda of Lakshm\xc4\xabdhara,\n\np. 113\n\nwith Svayamprak\xc4\x81\xc5\x9ba\'s commentary, translated by A. E. Gough in "The Pandit,"\nvol. 8, 9 ( _Benares,_ 1873).\n\nOf the chief _Sanskrit_ texts of the Ved\xc4\x81nta schools numerous editions have\nbeen published in India. Among the best are those issued in the "Anand\xc4\x81\xc5\x9brama\nSanskrit Series" from the \xc4\x80nand\xc4\x81\xc5\x9brama Press, Poona.\n\nThe student is not likely to derive much exact knowledge from the publications\nof irresponsible neo-vedantic societies in Europe and America. These bodies\nhave the commendable object of making the principles of the Ved\xc4\x81nta\nintelligible to modern Western thinkers; but until they display a more\nscientific and historical spirit their success is likely to be limited.\n\n_Printed by Hazell, Watson & Viney, Ld., London and Aylesbury._\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Advertisements](brk48.htm)\n\n'
