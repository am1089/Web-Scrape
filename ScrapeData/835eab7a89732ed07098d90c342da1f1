And on account of the statement of place, and so on.\n\nBut how does the confined locality of the eye agree with Brahman which is\nomnipresent like the ether?--To this question we reply that there would indeed\nbe a want of agreement if that one locality only were assigned to the Lord.\nFor other localities also, viz. the earth and so on, are attributed to him in\nthe passage, 'He who dwells in the earth,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 3). And\namong those the eye also is mentioned, viz. in the clause, 'He who dwells in\nthe eye,' &c. The phrase 'and so on,' which forms part of the Sutra, intimates\nthat not only locality is assigned to Brahman, although not (really)\nappropriate to it, but that also such things as name and form, although not\nappropriate to Brahman which is devoid of name and form, are yet seen to be\nattributed to it. That, in such passages as 'His name is ut, he with the\ngolden beard' ( _Kh_. Up. I, 6, 7, 6), Brahman although devoid of qualities is\nspoken of, for the purposes of devotion, as possessing qualities depending on\nname and form, we have already shown. And we have, moreover, shown that to\nattribute to Brahman\n\np. 126\n\na definite locality, in spite of his omnipresence, subserves the purposes of\ncontemplation, and is therefore not contrary to reason\n[1](sbe34052.htm#fn_149); no more than to contemplate Vish _n_ u in the sacred\n_s_ alagram.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 15](sbe34052.htm)\n\n"
