THE EIGHT PRINCIPLES OF RAJA YOGA\n\nWe will concern ourselves mainly with Raja Yoga, a system which has been found\nto be most applicable to the mental and physical conditions in which we live.\nRaja Yoga has eight principles. These are: (1) _Yama_ \xc2\x97non-killing,\ntruthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and non-receiving of any gifts; (2)\n_Niyama_ \xc2\x97cleanliness, contentment, mortification, study and self-surrender to\ngood; (3) _Asana_ \xc2\x97posture; (4) _Pranayama_ \xc2\x97control of vital body forces; (5)\n_Pratyahara_ \xc2\x97introspection; (6) _Dharana_ \xc2\x97concentration; (7) _Dhyana_\n\xc2\x97meditation; (8) _Samadhi_ \xc2\x97super-consciousness.\n\n_Yama_ and _Niyama_ constitute the moral training without which no practice of\nYoga will succeed. As this moral code becomes established, the practice of\nYoga will begin to be fruitful. The Yogi must not think of injuring either man\nor animal through thought, word or deed. However, this should not be extended\nto the limits to which the Jains of India carry it. Their creed forbids them\nto kill even an insect, and many never bathe lest by placing their bodies in\nwater they may drown some creature living upon them. Yoga is logical. Its\nprinciples are not rules of magic that must be followed\n\np. 14\n\nwithout deviation, but general principles that expand to cover the exigencies\nof any situation.\n\nBefore continuing with our discussion of Raja Yoga, we should make a\ndistinction between that school of thought and another, called Hatha Yoga.\n\nHatha Yoga deals entirely with the body. The sole aim of that school of Yoga\nis to make the body physically strong. For a strong body, however, you can\nachieve almost the same effects as those given by Hatha Yoga by enrolling in a\ngymnasium course at any muscle-building establishment. The exercises of Hatha\nYoga are difficult and demand years of steady endeavor. Through this system,\nit is claimed that a Yogi can establish perfect control over every part of his\nbody. The heart can be made to stop or go at his bidding and can control the\nflow of blood and the sensations of his nervous system.\n\nThe result of this part of Yoga is to make men stronger and to prolong their\nlives; good health is its one goal. From the point of view of the Raja Yogi,\nthe person who perfects himself in Hatha Yoga is merely a healthy animal. This\nsystem does not lead to spiritual growth or give man the help to meet his need\nfor relaxation which is found in Raja Yoga. However, certain aspects of Hatha\nYoga have become part of the regime of Raja Yoga. These include some of its\nexercises, dietary aspects, and disease preventives, which provide the\nphysical state of well-being which enables the proper pursuit of Yoga.\n\nThe exercises, or postures, are called _asanas_. These are a series of\nexercises which should be practiced daily until certain higher states are\nreached. They constitute the next stage in Yoga. At first, a posture should be\nadopted which can be held comfortably for a fairly long time. It has become\n\np. 15\n\nnecessary to adapt the traditional Yoga postures to meet the needs of Western\nman. While there is no evidence of any physical or physiological difference\nbetween the people of the East and West, there are certain acquired\ndifferences.\n\nOurs is a civilization in which much time, both at leisure and at work, is\nspent in a sitting position. In the East, the great mass of people are\nunfamiliar with the chair in its different forms. Theirs is what might be\ncalled a "squatting" culture. Hence muscular development from childhood on is\nalong different lines. Postures in which the Indian naturally relaxes would be\ntorture for the Westerner. The position which is easiest is the proper one to\nuse.\n\nYou will discover later that in the carrying out of these physiological\nmatters there will be a good deal of action going on in the body. Nerve\ncurrents will have to be displaced and given new channels. New vibrations will\nbegin and the constitution will in effect be remodeled. The main part of the\naction will lie along the spinal column, so that it is necessary to hold the\nspinal column free by sitting erect and holding the chest, head and neck in a\nstraight line. Let the whole weight of the body be supported by the ribs and\nin an easy natural posture with the spine straight. You will find that you\ncannot think high thoughts with the chest in. Such is the effect on the body\nof what we call the mind.\n\nAfter you have learned to have a firm, erect seat, you should perform a\npractice called the purification of the nerves. In the words of one of the\nancient scriptures, or Upanishads, "the mind whose dross has been cleared away\nby _pranayama_ becomes fixed in the path of Yoga ... first the nerves are to\nbe purified, then comes the power to practice _pranayama_."\n\np. 16\n\nThe technique for this is as follows: stopping the right nostril with the\nthumb, with the left nostril inhale according to your capacity. Without\npausing, exhale through the right nostril, while closing the left one. Now,\ninhale through the right nostril and exhale through the left. Practice this\nthree or five times at four intervals of the day\xc2\x97on awaking, at midday, in the\nevening and before going to sleep. Within fifteen days to a month, purity is\nattained; then begins _pranayama_.\n\nPractice is absolutely necessary. You may read about Yoga by the hour, but\nwithout practice, you will not make progress. We never understand without\nexperience. You will have to see and feel this yourself, as explanations and\ntheories will not do. There are several obstructions to practice. The first is\nan unhealthy body. You must keep your body in good health. Be careful of what\nyou eat and drink and what you do. Always use a mental effort to keep the body\nstrong. Keep in mind that health is but a means to an end.\n\nThe second obstruction is doubt. We always are skeptical about things we\ncannot see. You will naturally have doubts as to whether there is any truth in\nthis philosophy. With practice, however, even within a few days, the first\nglimpse will come, giving encouragement and hope. A widely-quoted commentator\non Yoga has written: "When one proof is realized, however little that may be,\nthat will give us faith in the whole teachings of Yoga." If you should\nconcentrate on the tip of your nose, in a few days you will begin to smell the\nmost beautiful fragrance. That will be enough to show that there are certain\nmental perceptions that can be made without contact with physical objects.\nRemember, too, that these are only the means. The aim, the goal, the end of\nthis\n\np. 17\n\ntraining is the liberation of the soul and freedom from tension and fear. You\nmust be master of your surroundings. Nature or the world about you must not\nrule you. Never forget that the body is yours, you do not belong to the body.\n\nNow, we may consider _pranayama_ , or breath control. What has this to do with\nconcentrating the powers of the mind? Breath is like the flywheel of your\nliving machine. In a big engine you will find that the flywheel moves first\nand that motion is conveyed to finer and finer machinery until the most\ndelicate and finest mechanism in the machine is set in motion. Breath is like\nthat flywheel, supplying and regulating the motive power to everything in the\nbody.\n\nConsider that we know very little about our own bodies. We cannot know. Our\nattention is not discriminating enough to catch the very fine movements that\nare going on within. We can know of them only as our minds enter our bodies\nand become more subtle. To get that subtle perception, we must begin with the\ngrosser perceptions, thus reaching the mysterious something which is setting\nthe whole engine in motion. That is _prana_ , the most obvious manifestation\nof which is the breath. Along with the breath, we slowly enter the body, which\nenables us to discover the subtle forces and how the nerve currents are moving\nthroughout the body. When we perceive and learn to feel these forces, we begin\nto get control over them and the body.\n\nThe mind is also set in motion by the different nerve currents, bringing us to\na state in which we have perfect control over body and mind, making both our\nservants. Knowledge is power, and to get this power we must begin at the\nbeginning, the _pranayama_ restraining the _prana_. As you follow this text,\nyou will see the reasons for each exercise\n\np. 18\n\nand learn which forces in the body are set in motion. You must practice at\nleast twice a day, preferably in the early morning and toward evening. When\nnight passes into day and day passes into night, there is a state of relative\ncalmness. At those times, your body will also have a tendency to become calm.\nTake advantage of these natural conditions and practice then. Make it a rule\nnot to smoke or eat until you have practiced. If you do this, the sheer force\nof hunger will prevent any tendency to laziness.\n\nIf possible, it is best to have a room devoted to your practice of Yoga and to\nno other purpose. Do not sleep in that room; you must keep it holy. You must\nnot enter the room until you have bathed and are perfectly clean in body and\nmind. Place flowers and pleasing pictures in the room. Have no quarreling, or\nanger or unholy thought there. Allow only those persons to enter who are of\nthe same thought as you are. Eventually, an aura of holiness will pervade that\nspace, and when you are sorrowful, doubtful or disturbed, entrance into that\nroom will make you calm. If you cannot afford a room, set aside a corner; if\nyou cannot do that, then find a place inside your house or out where you can\nbe alone and where the prospect is pleasing.\n\nSit in a straight posture. The first thing to do is to send a current of holy\nthought to all creation. Mentally repeat, "Let all things be happy; let all\nthings be peaceful; let all things be blissful." Do so to the East, South,\nNorth and West. The more you do, the better you will feel. You will find that\nthe easiest way to make yourself healthy is to see that others are healthy,\nand the easiest way to make yourself happy is to see that others are happy.\nAfterwards, if you believe in God, pray. Do not pray for money, or health, or\nheaven, but for knowledge and light; every other prayer is\n\np. 19\n\nselfish. The next thing to do is to think of your own body and see that it is\nstrong and healthy. Your body is the best instrument you have. Think of it as\nbeing adamant. Like a strong ship, it will help you to cross this ocean of\nlife. Freedom is never reached by the weak. Throw away all weakness. Tell your\nbody it is strong; tell your mind so. Have unbounded faith and hope in\nyourself. By following the instructions above, you will open your mind to the\nYogic forces. Another important aspect of Yoga, the postures, will be\ndiscussed in a later section.\n\n#### The Secret of Prana\n\n_Pranayama_ may seem at first to be totally involved with breathing. However,\nbreathing is only one of the many exercises through which we get to the real\n_pranayama_ , or control of the _prana_. According to old Indian philosophers,\nthe universe is composed of two materials, one of which is called _akasa_ ,\nthe omnipresent, all-penetrating existence. Everything that has form, or that\nis made up of compounds, evolves from the _akasa_. The _akasa_ becomes air,\nliquids, solids, the sun, moon, stars and comets. It is the _akasa_ that forms\nanimal and plant life. It is everything we see, all that can be sensed and\neverything that exists. It cannot be perceived, as it is so subtle that it is\nbeyond all human perception. It can be seen only when it has become gross and\ntaken form. At the beginning of creation there was only this _akasa_ , at the\nend of the cycle, solids, liquids and gases melt into the _akasa_ again, and\nthe next creation evolves from the _akasa_.\n\nThe _akasa_ is manufactured into our universe by the power of _prana_. Just as\n_akasa_ is the infinite omnipresent _material_ of our universe, so is _prana_\nthe infinite, omnipresent\n\np. 20\n\n_power_ of this universe. At the beginning and at the end of a cycle\neverything becomes _akasa_ and all the forces that are in the universe resolve\nback into the _prana_. In the next cycle, out of this _prana_ is evolved\neverything that we call energy or force. It is the _prana_ that is manifested\nas motion, the power of gravity and magnetism. The _prana_ is manifested as\nthe actions of the body, nerve currents and thought. All thought and all\nphysical motion are manifestations of _prana_. The sum total of all force in\nthe universe, mental or physical, when resolved back to its original state, is\ncalled _prana_. The knowledge and control of this _prana_ is really what is\nmeant by _pranayama_.\n\nThis opens the door to almost unlimited power. Suppose, for instance, one\nunderstood the _prana_ perfectly and could control it. What power on earth\ncould there be that would not be his? Many believe he would be able to move\nthe sun and stars out of their places, to control everything in the universe\nfrom the atoms to the biggest suns because he would control the vital force of\nthe universe, the _prana_. When the Yogi becomes perfect, there might be\nnothing in nature not under his control. All the forces of nature might obey\nhim as his slaves. But let us not reach beyond the stars!\n\nThe control of the _prana_ is the one goal of _pranayama_. This is the purpose\nof the training and exercises. Each man must begin where he stands, must learn\nhow to control the things that are nearest to him. Your body is the nearest\nthing to you, nearer than anything else in the universe, and your mind is the\nnearest of all. The power which controls this mind and body is the nearest to\nyou of all the _prana_ in the universe. Thus, the little wave of _prana_ which\nrepresents your own mental and physical energies is the nearest wave of all\nthat infinite ocean of _prana_. You must first learn to\n\np. 21\n\ncontrol that little wave of _prana_ within you. If you will analyze the many\nschools of thought in this country, such as faith-healers, spiritualists,\nChristian Scientists, hypnotists, therapists and many psychologists and\npsychiatrists, you may find that each attempts to control the _prana_.\nFollowing different paths, they stumbled on the discovery of a force whose\nnature they do not know, but they unconsciously use the same powers which the\nYogi uses and which come from _prana_.\n\nThis _prana_ is the vital force in every being and the finest and highest\naction of _prana_ is thought. There are several planes of thought. Instinctive\nthought has been called "conditioned reflex" by Western scholars. If a\nmosquito bites you, your hand will strike it automatically. All reflex actions\nbelong to this plane of thought. There is also a higher plane of thought, the\nconscious. You reason, judge, think, see pros and cons of certain situations.\n\nReason, however, is limited; its sphere is very small. We are constantly\nconfronted with facts which penetrate our consciousness from the outside,\nfacts which are ordinarily beyond the powers of the reason. The Yogi believes\nthe mind can exist on this higher plane, the superconscious. When the mind has\nattained to that state which is called _samadhi_ \xc2\x97perfect concentration or\nsuperconsciousness\xc2\x97it goes beyond the limits of reason, and comes face to face\nwith facts which instinct or reason can never know. Manipulation of the subtle\nforces of the body, which are different manifestations of _prana_ , if\ntrained, stimulates the mind, which progresses to the plane of the\nsuperconscious.\n\nLet us repeat that _pranayama_ has little to do with breathing, except insofar\nas breathing is an exercise which helps you attain control of the vital\nforces. The most obvious manifestation\n\np. 22\n\nof _prana_ in the human body, therefore, is the motion of the lungs. If that\nstops, all the other manifestations of force in the body will also stop. This\nis considered to be the principal gross motion of the body. To reach the more\nsubtle, we must utilize the grosser and so travel toward the most subtle.\nBreath does not produce the motion of the lungs. On the contrary, the motion\nof the lungs produces breath. _Prana_ moves the lungs, and the motion of the\nlungs draws in air.\n\nFrom the explanation above, it can be seen that _pranayama_ is not breathing,\nbut controlling that muscular power which moves the lungs. Muscular power\nwhich travels through the nerves to the muscles and from those to the lungs,\nmaking them move in a certain manner, is the _prana_. Once this _prana_ is\ncontrolled, we find that other actions of the _prana_ in the body slowly come\nunder control. If we have control over certain muscles, why not obtain control\nover every muscle and nerve? What stands in the way? At present, control is\nlost, and the motion has become automatic. We cannot move our ears at will,\nbut we know that animals can. We do not have that power because we do not\nexercise it. This is what is called atavism.\n\nWe know that physical agility which has been lost can be brought back to\nmanifestation. It has been shown, moreover, that by sincere work and practice,\nit is not only possible, but even probable that every part of the body can be\nbrought under perfect control.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 4.
