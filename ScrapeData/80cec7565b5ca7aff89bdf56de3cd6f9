Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! Now about the meditation (Dhyan) of the\nDevi Ganga as per Ka _n_ va S'akha, which destroys all the sins, O Gange! Of\nwhite colour like white lotuses! Thou destroyest all the sins of men. Thou\nhast appeared from the body of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. Thou art powerful like Him.\nThou art very chaste and pure. Thou hast worn the raiment, uninflammable and\ndecorated all over with ornaments made of jewels. Thou art more brilliant than\none hundred autumnal Moons. Thou art also well pleased with a smile on Thy\nlips. And Thou art always of steady youthful beauty (that never wanes). Thou\nart dear to Naraya _n_ a, calm and of peaceful temper, and proud of being His\nwith His fortune. Thou bearest the braid of hair, decked with garlands of\nMalati flowers; Thy cheeks are anointed with sandal dots, with Sindura bindu\n(dots of red powder, vermilion) and well adorned with various artistic lines\nmade of musk. Thy garment and Thy beautiful lips are more red than the ripe\nBimba fruit (the red fruit of a cucurbitaceous plant); Thy teeth vie as it\nwere, with the rows of pearls. How lovely are Thy eyes! How delightsome is Thy\nside-long glance! How close are Thy breasts like Bel fruits! Thy loins are\nthicker and more solid then the plantain trees. How do Thy feet look\nbeautiful, defying the beauty of the Sthalapadma (ground Lotus)!\n\n\n\nHow do the red sandals look lovely with Kunkuma and alaktak (red powder)! What\na red tinge Thy feet have shewn with the honey of\n\n\n\np. 851\n\n\n\nParijata flower that is seen on the head of Indra. The Devas, the Siddhas, the\nMunis, offer always Arghyas (offerings of rice with Durba grass) at Thy feet;\nthe ascetics bow down at Thy feet, and it seems as though so many lines of\nbees are on Thy lotus feet. O Mother! Thy lotus feet give liberation to those\nthat want Mukti and enjoyment to those that want Bhukti (enjoyments). O\nMother! Thou art the boon; Thou art the chief excellent; Thou grantest boons\nand Thou showest Thy favour to Thy devotees; Thou bestowest the Vi _sn_ upadam\n(the place of Vi _sn_ u); but Thou hast come from the feet of Vi _sn_ u. Thus\nmeditating on the Devi Ganga flowing by three routes (in Heaven, earth and\ninfernal regions), the bestower of good things one should offer to the Devi\nsixteen things :-- \xc3\x82sana, Padya, Arghya, water for bathing, ointment\n(anulepana), Dhupa (scents), Dipa (lights), Naivedya (offerings of food),\nbetel, cool water, clothings, ornaments garlands, sandal-paste, \xc3\x82chamaniya\n(water for sipping), and beautiful beddings and worship Her with these. Then,\nwith folded hands, one should perform stotra to Her and bow down to Her with\ndevotion. Thus the worshipper gets the fruits of A'svamedha sacrifice.\n\n\n\n16\\. Narada said :-- O Lord of the Devas! At present I am desirous to hear the\nsin-destroying and virtue-bestowing stotra (hymn) of Ganga Devi, the Purifier\nof all those that are fallen from virtue, originated from the feet of Vi _sn_\nu, the Lord of world and the husband of Lak _s_ mi. Kindly narrate all these\nin detail.\n\n\n\n17-41. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! Now I am narrating the stotra of Ganga\nDevi, that destroys all sins and bestows all religious merit. Hear. I bow down\nto the Ganges who appeared from the body of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, enchanted by the\nmusic of S'iva, and, who was bathed with the perspiration (water coming out of\nthe body) of S\xc2\x92ri Radha. I bow down to Ganga Devi who first appeared in the\ncircular dance (Rasa Ma _nd_ alam) in the region of Goloka and who always\nremains with S'ankara. My obeisance to the Devi Ganga who remains in the\nauspicious grand utsab of Radha (Rasa Ma _nd_ alam), crowded with Gopas and\nGopis, in the Full Moon night of the month of Kartik. She is one koti yojanas\nwide and one lakh times one koti yojanas long in the region of Goloka. My\nObeisance to Her! In Vaiku _nt_ ha, Ganga is sixty lakh yojanas in width and\nfour times that in length. My Obeisance to Her! In Brahma-loka, Ganga is\nthirty lakh yojanas wide and five times as long. I bow down to Her. In S'iva-\nloka, She is thirty lakh yojanas wide and four times that in length. I bow\ndown to Her. In Dhruva-loka, She is one lakh yojanas wide and seven times as\nlong. I bow down to Her. In Chandra-\n\n\n\np. 852\n\n\n\nloka She is one lakh yojanas wide and five times as long. My obeisance to S\xc2\x92ri\nGanga Devi. I bow down to the Ganges who is sixty thousand yojanas wide in the\nSurya loka and ten times that in length. I bow down to Ganga in Tapo-loka who\nis one lakh yojanas wide and five times that in length. My obeisance to Ganga\nDevi in Janar-loka, who is one thousand yojanas wide and ten times that as\nlong. I bow down to Ganga in Mahar-loka who is ten lakh yojanas wide and five\ntimes that in length. My obeisance to Ganga Devi in Kailas'a who is one\nthousand yojanas wide and one hundred times as long. I bow down to Ganga Devi\nwho is known as Mandakini in Indra-loka, and who is one hundred yojanas wide\nand ten times than that in length. My obeisance to Ganga Devi, known as\nBhogavati in Patala who is ten yojanas wide and five times as long. I bow down\nto Ganga Devi, known as Alakananda in this earth, who is two miles wide, in\nsome places more wide and in some places less wide. I bow down to Ganga Devi\nwho was of the colour of milk in Satya yuga, of the colour of Moon in Treta\nYuga, of the colour of white sandal-paste in Dvapara yuga. I bow down to S\xc2\x92ri\nGanga Devi who is as water in Kali yuga in this earth and as milk in Kali yuga\nin Heaven. O Child! By the touch of one molecule of the water of the Ganges,\nall the horrible sins incurred in ten million births, the murder of a Brahmi\n_n_ and so forth, are burnt to ashes. Thus I have described in twenty-one\nverses the great stotra (human) of the sin-destroying and the virtue-\nincreasing merits of Ganga. He reaps the fruit of the A'svamedha sacrifice\n(Horse sacrifice), who daily sings this praise of Ganga after worshipping Her\nwith devotion. There is no doubt in this. The persons that are without any\nsons get sons hereby and those who have no wives get wives. The diseased get\nthemselves free from their diseases, and the man who is under bondage, is\nliberated from that bondage. He who getting up early in the morning reads this\nstotra of Ganga, becomes widely known even if he be not known at all and he\nbecomes illumined with wisdom even if he be quite ignorant. Even if he sees a\nbad dream, he acquires the merit of bathing in the Ganges and of seeing good\ndreams.\n\n\n\n42-44. S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a spoke :-- O Narada! With this stotra (hymn) did\nBhagiratha praise the Ganga Devi. Who then went with him to the spot where the\nSagara's sons were burnt to ashes by the curse of Kapila. By the contact of\nthe wind in touch with the particles of water of the Ganges, those sons of\nSagara were instantly freed of their curses and they all repaired to Vaiku\n_nt_ ha. She is named Bhagirathi, because Bhagiratha brought Her to this\nearth. Thus I have described to you the story of the Ganges.\n\n\n\nThis anecdote is highly meritorious and the great step to liberation. What\nmore do you now want to hear? Say.\n\n\n\np. 853\n\n\n\n45-46. Narada said :-- O Lord! How did Ganga come to flow through the three\nworlds by three routes, and thus purify them? How was she carried and to which\nplaces? How did the people of those localities accord respect to Her? Kindly\ndescribe all these in detail.\n\n\n\n47-79. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! On the Full Moon night of the month of\nKartik in the Rasa ma _nd_ alam, at the great festivity in honour of Radha,\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a worshipped Radha and remained there. Next Radha, worshipped by\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, was worshipped by Brahma and the other Devas, by Saunaka and\nthe other Ri _s_ is, who also stopped there with much gladness. At this moment\nthe Devi Sarasvati, the Presiding Deity of the Science of Music began to sing\nlovely songs regarding Kri _sn_ a, in tune with vocal and instrumental music.\nBrahma became glad and presented to Sarasvati a necklace of jewels; Maha Deva\ngave her gems and jewels rare in this universe; Kri _sn_ a presented the best\nKaustubha jewel; Radhika offered excellent invaluable necklace of jewels;\nNaraya _n_ a presented to her the best and most excellent garland of jewels;\nLak _s_ mi gave her invaluable golden earrings decked with gems; Vi _sn_\nu-Maya Mula Prakriti, Bhagvati Durga, who is Naraya _n_ i, \xc3\x8es'vari, \xc3\x8es'ani,\npresented Her devotion to Brahma, so very rare; Dharma gave her devotion to\nDharma and high fame; Agni (fire) gave her excellent raiments purified by fire\nand Vayu gave Her Nupura (toe ornaments) made of gems and jewels. At this\ntime, Mahes'vara, the Lord of Bhutas (elements) began to sing, at the\nsuggestion of Brahma, songs relating to S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a's grand Rasa festival.\nHearing this, the Devas became very much enchanted and remained motionless\nlike statues. With great difficulty, they regained their consciousness. Then\nthey saw that there was no Radha nor Kri _sn_ a in this Rasa ma _nd_ ala;\neverything was deluged with water. The Gopas, Gopis, Devas and Brahma _n_ as\nbegan to cry loudly. Brahma in his meditation then came to know that Radha and\nKri _sn_ a both have assumed this liquid appearance for the deliverance of the\npeople of the world. Brahma and others, all began to praise S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a\nand said :-- \xc2\x93O All prevading One! Now be pleased to show us Thy form and\ngrant us our desired boons.\xc2\x94 At that instant a sweet incorporeal voice was\nclearly heard by all, as coming from air above, that, \xc2\x93I am the Self of all,\npervading all; and this my S\xc2\x92akti, Radha, is also the Self of all, prevades\nall; so there is no separation of us from you all even for a moment. It is\nonly to show our favour to the devotees that we assume special forms. For this\nreason only there is separation of us from you as regards this body! There is\nnothing else. Besides you have no necessity with our bodies. O Devas! Now if\nmy Manus, men, Munis, Vai _sn_ avas and you all, purified by Mantras desire\nvery much to see My Form clearly, then I tell you to request Mahes'vara to\ncarry out My word. O Brahma! O Creator! Better ask\n\n\n\np. 854\n\n\n\nMahadeva, the World Teacher, that He would better compose the beautiful Tantra\nS'astra, in accordance with the limbs of the Vedas. And that the above S'astra\nbe full of Mantras, capable to yield desired fruits, Stotras (hymns) and\nKavachas (protection mantras) and rules of due worship in proper order. And\nthat also My Mantra, My Stotra, and My Kavacha be also given there in a hidden\nform. So that those people that are sinners might not understand their real\nmeanings and thus turn out against Me. It may be that one in a thousand or in\na hundred may worship My Mantra. And My Mantra worshippers, the saints, become\npurified and come to My Abode. If My S'astra be not well made (i. e., if\neveryone be able to understand its meaning) and if everyone be able to go from\nBhurloka to Goloka, then Thy labour in this creation of the world will all be\nin vain. Therefore dost Thou better create different worlds according to the\ndifferences of Sattvik, Rajasik, and Tamo Gu _n_ as; then some will be the\ninhabitants of this Bhurloka, some will be the inhabitants of Dyuloka\naccording to their Karmas. O Brahma _n_! If Maha Deva promises earnestly in\nthis assembly of the Devas, I will then exhibit My True Form.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Thus\nspeaking, the Eternal Puru _s_ a S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a remained silent (i. e., the\naerial incorporeal voice stopped). Hearing this, Brahma, the Creator of the\nworld, gladly informed S\xc2\x92iva of this. When the Lord of Knowledge, the Foremost\nof the J\xc3\xb1anins, Bhutanatha heard the words of the Creator, He took the Ganges\nwater in His hands and swore that \xc2\x93I will complete the Tantra S'astra, full of\nRadha mantras and not opposed to the Vedas. If one touches the Ganges water\nand speaks lies, one remains in the terrible Kalasutra hell for a period of\none Brahma's life time.\xc2\x94 O Dvija! When Bhagavan S'ankara said this before the\nassembly of the Devas in the region of Goloka, S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a appeared there\nwith Radha. The Devas became exceedingly glad to see Him. They praised Him,\nthe Best Puru _s_ a and they were all filled with rapture and again engaged\nthemselves in the grand Rasa Festival. Some time after, Maha Deva lighted the\nTorch of Mukti, i.e., the Tantra S'astra was published by Him, as promised. O\nChild! Thus I have disclosed to you this anecdote, so very secret, and hard to\nbe attained. Thus S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a Himself, is verily the liquid Ganga sprung\nin the region of Goloka. This holy Ganga, born of the bodies of Kri _sn_ a and\nRadha inseparable from each other, grants enjoyment, lordship and liberation.\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Highest Self, has placed Her in various places; so Ganga\nis of the nature of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a and is everywhere, equally honoured\neverywhere in the Brahma _nd_ a (universe).\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twelfth Chapter in the Ninth Book on the origin of Ganga in the\nMahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 13](bk09ch13.htm)\n\n"
