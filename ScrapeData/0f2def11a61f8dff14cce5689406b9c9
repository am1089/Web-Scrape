Now there are three kinds of gods,--the Vasus, the Rudras, and the\n\xc3\x82dityas. Between them the press-feasts are divided: the morning pressing\nbelongs to the Vasus, the midday pressing to the Rudras, and the third\npressing to the \xc3\x82dityas. But the morning pressing belonged to the Vasus\nexclusively, and the midday pressing to the Rudras exclusively, and the third\npressing to the \xc3\x82dityas conjointly (with others).\n\n4:3:5:22\\. The \xc3\x82dityas then said, 'As that morning pressing belongs\nexclusively to the Vasus, and that midday pressing exclusively to the Rudras,\nso offer ye now to us a libation before the common (pressing).' The gods said,\n'So be it!' After the completion of the midday pressing, they offered that\n(libation) previous to the third pressing 1. And in like manner is that\nlibation offered to this day after the completion of the midday pressing and\nprevious to the third pressing.\n\n4:3:5:33\\. The \xc3\x82dityas said, 'Neither in the one pressing have we a share nor\nin the other: we fear lest the Rakshas might injure us!'\n\n4:3:5:44\\. They said to the (cups) belonging to two deities (dvidevatya 2),\n'We are afraid of the Rakshas: pray, let us enter into you!'\n\np. 351\n\n4:3:5:55\\. The Dvidevatyas said, 'What will be our reward then?'--'By us ye\nshall be supplied with the Anuvasha _t_  1!', said the \xc3\x82dityas.--'So be it!'--\nThey entered into the dvidevatya cups.\n\n4:3:5:66\\. Hence, when at the morning pressing he (the Adhvaryu) proceeds with\nthe dvidevatya cups, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ draws Soma juice from the Dro _n_\nakala _s_ a into the \xc3\x82ditya vessel, with this much (of the formula, Va _g_. S.\nVIII, I), 'Thou art taken with a support!' The Adhvaryu calls for the\n(Agnidh's) _S_ rausha _t_ , and after the Adhvaryu's libation the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ pours (his juice into the fire), and with this much 'Thee\nto the \xc3\x82dityas!' he pours the remains (into the \xc3\x82ditya-sthali). In the same\nway at all (three dvidevatya libations).\n\n4:3:5:77\\. Thus, the reason why the Pratiprasthat _ri_ draws the Soma-juice,\nis that they entered into the dvidevatya cups. And the \xc3\x82dityas then said, 'By\nus ye shall be supplied with the Anuvasha _t_!' For, that second libation\nwhich he (the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ) makes, he makes to (Agni) Svish _t_ ak _ri_\nt, and by means of the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t these (dvidevatyas) are supplied\nwith the Anuvasha _t_ ; and thus those (libations) of\n\np. 352\n\nhis are supplied with the Anuvasha _t_ , having the (oblation to Agni) Svish\n_t_ ak _ri_ t performed for them. He offers on the north part (of the fire),\nfor that is the region of that god 1: hence he offers on the north part.\n\n4:3:5:88\\. And again, why the Pratiprasthat _ri_ draws the Soma. They entered\ninto the Dvidevatyas; and from those which they entered he thereby draws them\nout. He then covers it 2\\--for they were afraid of the Rakshas--with 'O Vish\n_n_ u, Far-strider, here is thy Soma, protect it lest they should injure it!'\nFor Vish _n_ u is the sacrifice: to the sacrifice he thus makes it over for\nprotection. Now, after the completion of the midday Soma feast and before the\nevening feast he says, 'Come hither, Sacrificer!'\n\n4:3:5:99\\. They enter (the Havirdhana) together,--the Adhvaryu, Sacrificer,\n\xc3\x82gnidhra, Pratiprasthat _ri_ , Unnet _ri_ , and whatever other attendant (of\nthe Adhvaryu) there is 3. They close both doors,--for they (the \xc3\x82dityas) were\nafraid of the Rakshas. He (the Adhvaryu) takes up the \xc3\x82ditya-sthali and\n\xc3\x82ditya-patra, and holds them close over the Putabh _ri_ t, 'lest (any Soma\njuice) should be spilt.'\n\n4:3:5:1010\\. He then draws (the juice from the sthali into the patra) with (Va\n_g_. S. VIII, 2; Rig-veda VIII, 51, 7), 'At no time art thou barren, and never\nfailest thou the worshipper, O Indra; but\n\np. 353\n\nmore and ever more is thy divine gift increased, O mighty lord!--Thee to the\n\xc3\x82dityas!'\n\n4:3:5:1111\\. Let him not draw it with a 'support'--for it was originally drawn\nwith a support--to avoid a repetition (of sacrificial performance); but were\nhe now also to draw it with a support, he would certainly commit a repetition.\n\n4:3:5:1212\\. Having withdrawn (the cup for a moment from the flowing juice),\nhe again pours it in with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 3; Rig-veda VIII, 52, 7), 'At no\ntime art thou heedless, but watchest over both generations; the Soma feast 1\nis thy strength, O fourth \xc3\x82ditya: the ambrosia is ready for thee in the\nheavens!--Thee to the \xc3\x82dityas!'\n\n4:3:5:1313\\. Thereupon he takes sour milk; for the evening pressing belongs to\nthe \xc3\x82dityas, and cattle are after (the manner of) the \xc3\x82dityas 2: he thereby\nputs milk into the cattle, and thus that milk in cattle is beneficial 3. 'He\nshould put it right in the centre (of the \xc3\x82ditya cup),' they say, 'for that\nmilk is right in the centre of cattle.' But let him rather put it in the back\npart (of the cup), for that milk is in the hind part of cattle.\n\n4:3:5:1414\\. And the reason why he takes sour milk is that those remains (of\nSoma) poured together are the leavings of offerings, and insufficient for an\noblation: he now increases those (remains), and thus they\n\np. 354\n\nbecome sufficient for an oblation. This is why he takes sour milk.\n\n4:3:5:1515\\. He takes it with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 4; Rig-veda I, 107, I), 'The\nsacrifice draweth nigh to the glory of the gods: be ye merciful, O \xc3\x82dityas!\nLet your favour incline unto us, that it may set us free from all trouble!--\nThee to the \xc3\x82dityas!'\n\n4:3:5:1616\\. He mixes it by means of the Upa _m_ _s_ usavana stone 1. For,\nindeed, that \xc3\x82ditya Vivasvat (the sun) is really the same as the Upa _m_ _s_\nusavana, and this is the \xc3\x82ditya libation: thus he makes him delight in his own\nshare.\n\n4:3:5:1717\\. He touches it neither with the fringe nor with (the woven part\nof) the straining-cloth; for those two pressings, the morning pressing and\nmidday pressing, forsooth are rich in pure Soma, rich in juice, but this, the\nthird pressing, is emptied of its pure Soma. Now, in that he does not touch it\neither with the fringe or the straining-cloth, thereby that third pressing of\nhis also becomes rich in pure Soma and juice: therefore he touches it neither\nwith the fringe nor with the straining-cloth.\n\n4:3:5:1818\\. He mixes it with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 5), 'O \xc3\x82ditya Vivasvat, this\nis thy draught of Soma: feast thou upon it!' Thereupon he hands the Upa _m_\n_s_ usavana to the Unnet _ri_. Then he says to the Unnet _ri_ , 'Drop in the\npressing-stones!' He drops them either into the \xc3\x82dhavaniya or into a cup 2.\n\np. 355\n\n4:3:5:1919\\. After drawing the king (Soma)--the third press-feast belonging to\nthe \xc3\x82dityas, and the pressing-stones being after (the manner of 1) the\n\xc3\x82dityas, he thus makes them delight in their own share--they open the doors.\n\n4:3:5:2020\\. He now walks out, covering (the cup with his hand or the sthali);\nfor they (the \xc3\x82dityas) were afraid of the Rakshas. He then says (to the\nMaitravaru _n_ a), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the \xc3\x82dityas!' If he\nlikes, he may now enumerate (their qualities); but let him rather enumerate\nthem, after he has called for the _S_ rausha _t_ ,--'Prompt (the Hot _ri_ to\nrecite the offering prayer) to the \xc3\x82dityas, the beloved, rite-loving, law-\nloving lords of the great abode, the rulers of the wide air.' He offers, as\nthe Vasha _t_ is pronounced. He (the Hot _ri_ ) pronounces no Anuvasha _t_ ,\nlest he should consign the cattle to the fire. The remains (of juice in the\nsthali and graha) he (the Adhvaryu) hands to the Pratiprasthat _ri_.\n\n4:3:5:2121\\. Thereupon he again enters (the Havirdhana) and draws the \xc3\x82graya\n_n_ a graha 2. They spread (over the Putabh _ri_ t) a straining-cloth with the\nfringe towards the north. The Adhvaryu pours out (the\n\np. 356\n\njuice) of the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a; the Pratiprasthat _ri_ holds out (and pours in)\nthe two residues (of the \xc3\x82ditya graha 1); the Unnet _ri_ adds thereto (some\njuice from the \xc3\x82dhavaniya) by means of a _k_ amasa cup or a dipping-vessel\n(uda _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ana).\n\n4:3:5:2222\\. Thus he draws the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a graha from four streams; for the\nevening pressing belongs to the .\xc3\x82dityas, and cows are after the manner of the\n\xc3\x82dityas; whence this milk of cows is of a fourfold nature: therefore he draws\nthe \xc3\x82graya _n_ a from four streams 2.\n\n4:3:5:2323\\. And as to why the Pratiprasthat _ri_ holds out the two residues:\nthis is (the remains of) the \xc3\x82ditya libation, and for the \xc3\x82ditya libation he\npronounces no Anuvasha _t_ ; and from that (\xc3\x82graya _n_ a graha) he intends to\ndraw the Savitra graha,--so that the Anuvasha _t_ is performed for it by means\nof the Savitra graha.\n\n4:3:5:2424\\. And again why the Pratiprasthat _ri_ holds out the two residues.\nPrevious to that mixed (press-feast), previous to the evening feast, they have\noffered that (unmixed or special) libation to those (\xc3\x82dityas); but this\nlibation is taken for the evening feast: thereby the \xc3\x82dityas take part in the\nevening feast, and thus they are not excluded from the sacrifice. This is why\nthe Pratiprasthat _ri_ holds out the two residues 3.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[350:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_820) The \xc3\x82ditya-graha, with which the succeeding\nparagraphs deal, is considered as not belonging to the T _ri_ tiya Savana\nproper, but as a preliminary ceremony.\n\n[350:2](sbe2654.htm#fr_821) For the three dvidevatya grahas (Aindravayava,\nMaitravaru _n_ a, and \xc3\x82 _s_ vina), see Brahma _n_ as [IV, 1,\n3](sbe2642.htm#4:1:3)-[5](sbe2644.htm#4:1:5).\n\n[351:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_822) At the three dvidevatya libations no Anuvasha _t_\nkara is permitted; that is to say, the Hot _ri_ is not to pronounce the words,\n'O Agni, accept of the Soma!' after the Vasha _t_ , with which the offering\nprayer (ya _g_ ya) concludes. But as the libation, ordinarily made at the\nAnuvasha _t_ , corresponds to the oblation to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t made\nafter each chief oblation at the havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a (see I, 7,3; Ait. Br. III,\n5), there is apparently no such Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t oblation at the dvidevatya\nlibations. Now, as each of these chief libations, made by the Adhvaryu, is\nfollowed by one made by the Pratiprasthat _ri_ from the \xc3\x82ditya vessel (see [p.\n316](sbe2649.htm#page_316), note [1](sbe2650.htm#fn_763)), these latter\nlibations are here, as it were, identified with the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t and\nthe Anuvasha _t_ kara.\n\n[352:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_823) See I, 7, 3, 20.\n\n[352:2](sbe2654.htm#fr_824) The remains of Soma-juice he pours after each\nlibation from the \xc3\x82ditya-patra into the \xc3\x82ditya-sthali, and finally puts the\nformer on the latter by way of a lid. See [p. 326](sbe2651.htm#page_326), note\n[1](sbe2651.htm#fn_775).\n\n[352:3](sbe2654.htm#fr_825) While they enter by the front door, the mistress\nof the house enters by the back (west) door. Katy. X, 4, 2.\n\n[353:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_826) The Rig-veda reads 'havanam' (invocation) instead\nof 'savanam.'\n\n[353:2](sbe2654.htm#fr_827) Or, cattle correspond, stand in relation, to the\n\xc3\x82dityas. Saya _n_ a takes 'anu' in the sense of 'behind, inferior to,\ndependent upon (hina).' The cattle are inferior to, or dependent upon, the\n\xc3\x82dityas, inasmuch as the \xc3\x82dityas give the rain on which the cattle depend for\ntheir food.\n\n[353:3](sbe2654.htm#fr_828) Or, 'put' (hita) into them.\n\n[354:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_829) See [p. 238](sbe2638.htm#page_238), note\n[2](sbe2639.htm#fn_587).\n\n[354:2](sbe2654.htm#fr_830) 'Into the \xc3\x82dhavaniya trough or into a _k_ amasa\ncup containing Soma-juice,' Katy. X, 4, 10; 'into the \xc3\x82dhavaniya or the\nSambhara _n_ i,' Ka _n_ va text; 'into the \xc3\x82dhavaniya or into the graha,'\nWeber, Ind. Stud. X, 386. Perhaps the next paragraph has to p. 355 be taken\nalong with this: 'Or into a _k_ amasa, after drawing Soma (into it).'\nAccording to Katy., the stones are taken out again immediately and laid down\nin their places on the pressing-skin.\n\n[355:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_831) See p. 353, note 2. Saya _n_ a again takes 'anu'\nin the sense of 'after, behind,' apparently on the ground that, in the above\nformulas, the stones are mentioned after the \xc3\x82ditya. The text of my manuscript\nis, however, rather corrupt at this place.\n\n[355:2](sbe2654.htm#fr_832) The \xc3\x82graya _n_ a Soma was originally drawn into\nthe \xc3\x82graya _n_ a bowl (sthali) and deposited in its place in the centre of the\nkhara. It is now poured from the bowl into some other vessel, and thence\nthrough a straining-cloth into the Putabh _ri_ t.\n\n[356:1](sbe2654.htm#fr_833) 'Sampraskandayati pratiprasthatadityapatrayo _h_\nsa _m_ sravam,' Ka _n_ va text.\n\n[356:2](sbe2654.htm#fr_834) In drawing the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a cup he uses the same\nformula as at the morning pressing. See [IV, 2, 2, 9](sbe2646.htm#4:2:2:9)\nseq.\n\n[356:3](sbe2654.htm#fr_835) In the actual performance of the Agnish _t_ oma\nthe drawing of the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a graha is followed by sour milk being poured to\nthe Soma-juice left in the Putabh _ri_ t, the compound being consecrated by\nthe lady eying it with an appropriate mantra. Thereupon they leave the\nHavirdhana shed in the same way as at the morning feast p. 357 (see [IV, 2, 5,\n1](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:1), with notes), and perform the Viprud-homas, followed\nby the Sarpa _n_ a and chanting of the \xc3\x82rbhava, or T _ri_ tiya Pavamana stotra\n(for an account of which, see [p. 315](sbe2649.htm#page_315), note\n[2](sbe2649.htm#fn_759)). Then follow the oblations from the victim (which has\nbeen cooking since the morning, see [IV, 2, 5, 13](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:13)),\n&c., up to the eating of the pa _s_ vi _d_ a (see [III, 8, 3,\n4](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:4) seq.); and offering of the four Savaniya-puro _d_ a\n_s_ as, likewise up to the eating of the i _d_ a. Previous to the eating,\nsmall pieces of rice-cake are thrown into the _k_ amasa cups, as an oblation\nto the sacrificer's deceased ancestors, with naming of his father,\ngrandfather, and great-grandfather (as at the Pi _n_ _d_ apit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\na, II, 4, 2, 19 seq.); whereupon the pieces are eaten along with the i _d_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 1.
