He perceived those two Mahiman (greatness) cups of Soma at the A\n_s_ vamedha; he offered them; and thereby, indeed, became great and more\nnumerous: hence whosoever should desire to become great, and more numerous,\nlet him offer up those two Mahiman cups of Soma at the A _s_ vamedha; and he\nindeed becomes great and more numerous.\n\n13:2:11:22\\. He offers them on both sides (before and after) the omentum;--the\nA _s_ vamedha, doubtless, is the Sacrificer, and that Mahiman (cup) is the\nking: it is with royal dignity he thus encompasses him on both sides. Some\ngods have the svaha-call ('hail') in front, and the other gods have the svaha-\ncall behind 2: it is them he thus gratifies. With 'Hail\n\np. 328\n\nto the gods!' and 'To the gods hail!' he makes offering by means of the king\n(Soma) on both sides of the omentum: he thereby gratifies those gods who are\nin this world, and those who are in the other, and thus gratified, both these\nkinds of gods lead him to the heavenly world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[327:2](sbe44093.htm#fr_838) The formula uttered whilst the first Mahiman cup\nis offered runs thus (Va _g_. S. XXIII, 2): 'What greatness of thine there\nhath p. 328 been in the day and the year; what greatness of thine there hath\nbeen in the wind and the air; what greatness of thine there hath been in the\nheavens and the sun, to that greatness of thine, to Pra _g_ apati, hail, to\nthe gods!' whilst that of the second Mahiman cup runs thus (XXIII, 4): 'What\ngreatness of thine there hath been in the night and the year; what greatness\nof thine there hath been in the earth and the fire; what greatness of thine\nthere hath been in the Nakshatras (lunar asterisms) and the moon, to that\ngreatness of thine, to Pra _g_ apati, to the gods, hail!' cf. [XIII, 5, 2,\n23](sbe44107.htm#13:5:2:23); [3, 7](sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:7).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 3, 1. Third Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe44094.htm)\n\n"
