(Not altogether) for it (the dream) is indicative (of the future),\naccording to null; the experts also declare this.\n\nWell then, as dreams are mere illusion, they do not contain a particle of\nreality?--Not so, we reply; for dreams are prophetic of future good and bad\nfortune. For scripture teaches as follows, 'When a man engaged in some work\nundertaken for a special wish sees in his dreams a woman, he may infer success\nfrom that dream-vision.' Other scriptural passages declare that certain dreams\nindicate speedy death, so, e.g. 'If he sees a black man with black teeth, that\nman will kill him.'--Those also who understand the science of dreams hold the\nopinion that to dream of riding on an elephant and the like is lucky; while it\nis unlucky to dream of riding on a donkey, &c.; and that certain other dreams\nalso caused by special mantras or devatas or substances contain a particle of\ntruth.--In all\n\np. 137\n\nthese cases the thing indicated may be real; the indicating dream, however,\nremains unreal as it is refuted by the waking state. The doctrine that the\ndream itself is mere illusion thus remains uncontradicted.--On this account\nthe Vedic passage to which the first Sutra of this pada refers is to be\nexplained metaphorically. When we say 'the plough bears, i.e. supports the\nbullocks,' we say so because the plough is the indirect cause of the bullocks\nbeing kept 1, not because we mean that the plough directly supports the\nbullocks. Analogously scripture says that the dreaming person creates\nchariots, &c., and is their maker, not because he creates them directly but\nbecause he is the cause of their creation. By his being their cause we have to\nunderstand that he is that one who performs the good and evil deeds which are\nthe cause of the delight and fear produced by the apparition, in his dream, of\nchariots and other things 2.--Moreover, as in the waking state, owing to the\ncontact of the senses and their objects and the resulting interference of the\nlight of the sun, &c., the self-luminousness of the Self is, for the beholder,\ndifficult to discriminate, scripture gives the description of the dreaming\nstate for the purpose of that discrimination. If then the statements about the\ncreation of chariots, &c., were taken as they stand (i.e. literally) we could\nnot ascertain that the Self is self-luminous  3. Hence we have to explain the\npassage relative to the creation of chariots, &c., in a metaphorical sense, so\nas to make it agree with the statement about the non-existence of chariots,\n&c. This explains also the scriptural passage about the shaping (III, 2, 2).\nThe statement made above that in the Ka _th_ aka the highest Self is spoken of\nas the shaper\n\np. 138\n\nof dreams is untrue; for another scriptural passage ascribes that activity to\nthe individual soul, 'He himself destroying, he himself shaping dreams with\nhis own splendour, with his own light' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 9)\n[1](sbe38108.htm#fn_103). And in the Ka _th_ aka Upanishad itself also we\ninfer from the form of the sentence, 'That one who wakes in us while we are\nasleep,'--which is an anuvada, i.e. an additional statement about something\nwell known--that he who is there proclaimed as the shaper of lovely things is\nnobody else than the (well-known) individual soul. The other passage which\nforms the complementary continuation of the one just quoted ('That indeed is\nthe Bright, that is Brahman') discards the notion of the separate existence of\nthe individual soul and teaches that it is nothing but Brahman, analogously to\nthe passage 'That art thou.' And this interpretation does not conflict with\nBrahman being the general subject-matter.--Nor do we thereby deny altogether\nthat the highest (pra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a) Self is active in dreams; for as being the\nLord of all it may be considered as the guide and ruler of the soul in all its\nstates. We only maintain that the world connected with the intermediate state\n(i.e. the world of dreams) is not real in the same sense as the world\nconsisting of ether and so on is real. On the other hand we must remember that\nalso the so-called real creation with its ether, air, &c., is not absolutely\nreal; for as we have proved before (II, 1, 14) the entire expanse of things is\nmere illusion. The world consisting of ether, &c., remains fixed and distinct\nup to the moment when the soul cognizes that Brahman is the Self of all; the\nworld of dreams on the other hand is daily sublated by the waking state. That\nthe latter is mere illusion has, therefore, to be understood with a\ndistinction.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[137:1](sbe38107.htm#fr_100) Bullocks have to be kept because the fields must\nbe tilled.\n\n[137:2](sbe38107.htm#fr_101) The dreams have the purpose of either cheering or\nsaddening and frightening the sleeper; so as to requite him for his good and\nevil works. His ad _ri_ sh _t_ a thus furnishes the efficient cause of the\ndreams.\n\n[137:3](sbe38107.htm#fr_102) Because then there would be no difference between\nthe dreaming and the waking state.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 5](sbe38108.htm)\n\n"
