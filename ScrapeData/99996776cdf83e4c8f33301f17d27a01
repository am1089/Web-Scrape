Now follows (the rule regarding) the performance of ordeals.\n\n[39. Nand. takes the term dvi _g_ ottama, 'the best among the twice-born,' as\nan equivalent for 'Brahma _n_ as.' Kulluka (on M. VIII, 73) refers it to\n'twice-born men, who are particularly active in the discharge of their\nreligious duties.'\n\nIX. 2. Y. II, 96, 99.--II. M. VIII, 114, 115; Y. II, 95.--20-22. Y. II, 95,\n96, 99.--23. Y. II, 98.--33. Y. II, 97. The whole section on ordeals (IX-XIV)\nagrees very closely with the corresponding section of the Institutes of Narada\n(5, 107-9, 8).]\n\np. 53\n\n2\\. In cases of a criminal action directed against the king, or of violence[1]\n(they may be administered) indiscriminately.\n\n3\\. In cases of (denial of) a deposit or of (alleged.)\n\ntheft or robbery they must be administered each according to the value (of the\nproperty claimed).\n\n4\\. In all such cases the value (of the object claimed) must be estimated in\ngold.\n\n5\\. Now if its value amounts to less than one K _ri_ sh _n_ ala, a _S_ udra\nmust be made to swear by a blade of Durva grass, (which he must hold in his\nhand);\n\n6\\. If it amounts to less than two K _ri_ sh _n_ ala, by a blade of Tila;\n\n7\\. If it amounts to less than three K _ri_ sh _n_ ala, by a blade of silver;\n\n8\\. If it amounts to less than four K _ri_ sh _n_ ala, by a blade of gold;\n\n9\\. If it amounts to less than five K _ri_ sh _n_ ala, by a lump of earth\ntaken from a furrow;\n\n10\\. If it amounts to less than half a Suvar _n_ a, a _S_ udra must be made to\nundergo the ordeal by sacred libation;\n\n11\\. If it exceeds that amount, (the judge must administer to him) any one of\nthe (other) ordeals, viz. the ordeal by, the balance, by fire, by water, or by\npoison, considering duly (the season, &c.)\n\n12\\. If the amount (of the matter in contest) is twice as high (as in each of\nthe last-mentioned cases), a Vai _s_ ya must (in each case) undergo that\nordeal which has (just) been ordained (for a _S_ udra);\n\n13\\. A Kshatriya (must undergo the same ordeals), if the amount is thrice as\nhigh;\n\n[2. 1 See VIII, 2, note.]\n\np. 54\n\n14\\. A Brahma _n_ a, if it is four times as high. He is, however, not subject\nto the ordeal by sacred libation.\n\n15\\. No judge must administer the (ordeal by) sacred libation to a Brahma _n_\na;\n\n16\\. Except if it be done as a preliminary proof of his dealing fairly in some\nfuture transaction.\n\n17\\. Instead of (administering the ordeal by) sacred libation to a Brahma _n_\na (in suits regarding an object, the value of which amounts to less than two\nSuvar _n_ as), let the judge cause him to swear by a lump of earth taken from\na furrow.\n\n18\\. To one formerly convicted of a crime (or of perjury) he must administer\none of the ordeals, even though the matter in contest be ever so trifling.\n\n19\\. But to one who is known (and esteemed) among honest men and virtuous, he\nmust not (administer any ordeal), even though the matter in contest be ever so\nimportant.\n\n20\\. The claimant must declare his willingness to pay the fine (which is, due\nin case of his being defeated);\n\n21\\. And the defendant must go through the ordeal.\n\n22\\. In cases of a criminal action directed against the, king, or of violence\n(an ordeal may be administered) even without (the claimant) promising to pay\nthe fine (due in case of defeat in ordinary suits).\n\n23\\. To women, Brahma _n_ as, persons deficient in an organ of sense, infirm\n(old) men, and sick persons, the (ordeal by the) balance must be administered.\n\n24\\. But it must not be administered to them while a wind is blowing.\n\np. 55\n\n25\\. The (ordeal by) fire must not be administered to lepers, to infirm\npersons, or to blacksmiths;\n\n26\\. Nor must it ever be administered in autumn or summer.\n\n27\\. The (ordeal by) poison must not be administered to lepers, bilious\npersons, or Brahma _n_ as;\n\n28\\. Nor during the rainy season.\n\n29\\. The (ordeal by) water must not be administered to persons afflicted with\nphlegm or (another) illness, to the timid, to the asthmatic, nor to those who\ngain their subsistence from water (such as fishermen and the like);\n\n30\\. Nor during (the two cold seasons) Hemanta and _S_ i _s_ ira (or from\nmiddle of November to middle of March);\n\n31\\. The (ordeal by) sacred libation must not be administered to atheists;\n\n32\\. Nor when the country is afflicted with disease or pestilence.\n\n33\\. Let the judge summon the defendant at the time of sunrise, after having,\nfasted on the previous day and bathed in his clothes, and make him go through\nall the ordeals in the presence of (images of) the gods and of the (assessors\nand other) Brahma _n_ as.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X.](sbe07012.htm)\n\n"
