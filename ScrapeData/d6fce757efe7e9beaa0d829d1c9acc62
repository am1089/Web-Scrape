On the third of these nectars the \xc3\x82dityas live, with Varu _n_ a at their\nhead. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the\nnectar.\n\n2\\. They enter into that (dark) colour, and they rise from that colour.\n\n3\\. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the \xc3\x82dityas, with Varu _n_ a\nat their head, he sees the nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered that\ncolour, rises again from that colour.\n\n4\\. So long as the sun rises in the south and sets in the north, twice as long\ndoes it rise in the west and set in the east; and so long does he follow the\nsovereign supremacy of the \xc3\x82dityas.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 9](sbe01067.htm)\n\n'
