Exultation, pleasure, joy 4, these\nthree\n\np. 301\n\nare qualities appertaining to the quality of goodness. Grief, wrath,\npersistent hatred, these are stated to be qualities appertaining to the\nquality of passion. Sleep, sloth, and delusion, these three qualities are\nqualities appertaining to the quality of darkness. Cutting these off by\nmultitudes of arrows 1, a courageous man, free from sloth, having a tranquil\nself, and senses controlled, is energetic about subjugating others 2. On this,\npeople who know about ancient times celebrate verses which were sung of old by\nthe king Ambarisha, who had become tranquil (in mind). When vices 3 were in\nthe ascendant, and good (men) were oppressed, Ambarisha, of great glory,\nforceably possessed himself\n\np. 302\n\nof the kingdom 1. He (then) restraining his own vices, and honouring good men,\nattained high perfection, and sang these verses: 'I have conquered most vices;\ndestroyed all foes; but there is one, the greatest, vice which should be\ndestroyed and which I have not destroyed--that (vice), being impelled by\nwhich, a creature does not attain freedom from desire, and being troubled by\ndesire, understands (nothing) while running into ditches 2; (that vice), being\nimpelled by which, a man even does what ought not to be done. That avarice--\ncut (it) off, cut (it) off with sharp swords. For from avarice 3 is born\ndesire; then anxiety comes into existence; and he who desires, mostly acquires\nqualities appertaining to the quality of passion. Obtaining those, he mostly\nacquires qualities appertaining to the quality of darkness 4. When the bodily\nframe is destroyed, he, owing to these qualities, is born again and again, and\nengages in action. And at the expiration of life, again with his body\ndismembered and scattered about, he meets death, and again birth. Therefore,\nproperly perceiving this, and restraining avarice by courage, one should wish\nfor sovereignty in the self. This is sovereignty 5; there is no other\nsovereignty here. The self properly understood is itself the sovereign.' Such\nwere\n\np. 303\n\nthe verses sung with regard to the great sovereignty, by the glorious\nAmbarisha, who destroyed the one (chief vice), avarice.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[300:1](sbe0842.htm#fr_1442) I. e. the ra _g_ a-yoga, says Nilaka _nth_ a,\nwhich consists in mere control of the mind. Cf. Sa _n_ khya-sara, p. 39.\n\n[300:2](sbe0842.htm#fr_1443) See Yoga-sutra, p. 45.\n\n[300:3](sbe0842.htm#fr_1444) This means difficult, and occasioning many trials\nto one who performs it.\n\n[300:4](sbe0843.htm#fr_1445) Nilaka _nth_ a says exultation is when one is\nsure of obtaining what is desired, pleasure when it is obtained, and joy when\nthe thing obtained is enjoyed. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra takes a different\ndistinction; but our copy of his commentary is not quite intelligible in p.\n301 the beginning. Pleasure he takes to mean 'pride felt in supposing oneself\nto possess some merit,' and joy that produced when impending danger is\naverted. As to the next triad, the text is again unsatisfactory. The text\nprinted in the edition which contains Nilaka _nth_ a's commentary, is 'desire,\nanger,' &c. There is nothing about them in the commentary. Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra's text is the one we have adopted. He says, 'grief, pain caused by loss of\nwhat is desired; anger, the pain caused by the counteraction of one's attempts\nto injure another; persistent hatred, the pain caused by believing another to\nbe doing harm to oneself.' Persistent hatred is Nilaka _nth_ a's\ninterpretation. I think his interpretation is preferable. The two triads seem\nto be based on one principle of gradation. The distinctive marks of the three\nqualities are pleasure, pain, and delusion respectively, and those\ncharacterise the three triads stated in the text. See _S_ anti Parvan\n(Moksha), chap. 194, st. 27 seq.\n\n[301:1](sbe0843.htm#fr_1446) Tranquillity and so forth, Nilaka _nth_ a;\npractising yoga or concentration of mind, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[301:2](sbe0843.htm#fr_1447) I. e. external, says Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra;\nexternal foes of one's own emancipation is, I presume, what is meant.\n\n[301:3](sbe0843.htm#fr_1448) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says, I his own and those of\nothers.' Nilaka _nth_ a takes good to mean not men, but tranquillity, &c. The\nnext sentence seems rather to militate against this view, which in itself is\nnot a well-founded one.\n\n[302:1](sbe0843.htm#fr_1449) For the good of the people, says Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra.\n\n[302:2](sbe0843.htm#fr_1450) I. e. base actions, Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[302:3](sbe0843.htm#fr_1451) Avarice, according to Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, is\nthe belief that one has not got that which one has, and desire is the wish for\nmore and more. Avarice seems, however, to be the general frame of mind, always\nwishing for something, never being contented, and desire is the wish for a\nspecific object.\n\n[302:4](sbe0843.htm#fr_1452) Which are sources of delusion. Cf. a similar\ndoctrine at \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 140.\n\n[302:5](sbe0843.htm#fr_1453) Nilaka _nth_ a compares Taittiriya, p. 26.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XVII](sbe0844.htm)\n\n"
