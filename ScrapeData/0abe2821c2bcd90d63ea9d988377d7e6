( _cont_.)\n\np. 337\n\n76\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXVI.\n\nThe Ash _t_ a-kapala for Agni, the Ekada _s_ a-kapala or Dvada _s_ a-kapala\nfor Indra-Agni, form the principal acts at the Amavasya, the new moon, in the\ncase of one who does not sacrifice with Soma.\n\n77\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXVII.\n\nIn the case of one who sacrifices with Soma, the second principal act is the\nSa _m_ nayya (both at the full-moon and new-moon sacrifices).\n\n77c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe Sa _m_ nayya is a mixture of dadhi and payas, sour and sweet milk, and is\nintended for Indra or Mahendra 1. It takes the place of the second Puro _d_ a\n_s_ a at the new-moon sacrifice.\n\n78\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXVIII.\n\nIn the case of a Brahma _n_ a, who does not sacrifice with Soma, the\nAgnishomiya cake is omitted.\n\n78c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThis rule does not seem to be accepted by all schools. It is not found in\nKatyayana, and Hira _n_ yake _s_ in observes: Nasomaya _g_ ino brahma _n_\nasyagnishomiya _h_ puro _d_ a _s_ o vidyata ity ekesham. See Hillebrandt, l.c.\np. iii.\n\n79\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXIX.\n\nWithout distinction of caste, the Aindragna offering is omitted for one who\noffers the Sa _m_ nayya.\n\n79c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nEven though he be not a Somaya _g_ in, says the commentary.\n\np. 338\n\nThis whole matter is summed up in Kapardin's commentary: Amavasyayam asomaya\n_g_ ina aindragna-sa _m_ nayyayor vikalpa _h_. Paur _n_ amasya _m_ tv asomaya\n_g_ ino brahma _n_ asyagnishomiyayagabhava _h_. Tadrahitapi paur _n_ amasi\npurushartha _m_ sadhayati. Tatra dvayor eva hi yagayo _h_ paur _n_ amasi _s_\nabdava _k_ yatvam asti, pratyeka _m_ namayogat. Tasmad agnishomiyayagarahitav\nevetarau purushartha _m_ sadhayata _h_.\n\n80\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXX.\n\nThe Pit _ri_ -ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, the sacrifice to the fathers, is not A\xe1\xb9\x85ga\n(auxiliary) because its own time is prescribed.\n\n80c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe text should be pit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_ svakalavidhanad ana\xe1\xb9\x85ga _h_ syat.\nThis sacrifice for the Manes, called also the Pi _n_ _d_ a-pit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\na, falls under the new-moon sacrifice, but is to be considered as a pradhana,\na primary sacrifice, not as an a\xe1\xb9\x85ga, a member of the Dar _s_ a.\n\n81\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXXI.\n\nAlso, because it is enumerated like the Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasa sacrifice.\n\n81c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThis refers to such passages from the Brahma _n_ as as: There are four great\nsacrifices, the Agnihotram, the Dar _s_ apur _n_ amasau, the _K_ aturmasyani,\nand the Pi _n_ _d_ a-pit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_.\n\n82\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXXII.\n\nAlso, because, when the Amavasya sacrifice is barred, the Pit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\na is seen to take place.\n\n83\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXXIII.\n\nA principal act (pradhana) is accompanied by auxiliary acts (a\xe1\xb9\x85ga).\n\np. 339\n\n83c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThis Sutra forms sometimes part of the preceding Sutra, and would then refer\nto the Pit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a only.\n\n84\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXXIV.\n\nA principal act is what has its own name, and is prescribed with special\nreference to place, time, and performer.\n\n84c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThis Sutra is sometimes divided into two; the first, dese kale kartariti nirdi\n_s_ yate, the second, asva _s_ abda _m_ yat. The following are given as\nillustrations. If it is said that 'he should sacrifice with the Vai _s_ vadeva\non a slope inclined to the East,' we have the locality. If it is said that 'he\nshould sacrifice with the Va _g_ apeya in autumn,' we have the time. If it is\nsaid that 'the sacrificer himself should offer the Agnihotra on a parvan\n(change of the moon),' we have the performer. In each of these cases,\ntherefore, the prescribed sacrificial act is a pradhana sa\xe1\xb9\x85gam, a principal\nact with auxiliary members.\n\n85\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXXV.\n\nThe Darvi-homa (libation from a ladle) stands by itself.\n\n85c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nApurva is explained by the commentator, not in its usual sense of miraculous,\nbut as not being subject to the former regulations.\n\n86\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXXVI.\n\nThey are ordered by the word _g_ uhoti, he pours out.\n\n87\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXXVII.\n\nThey are offered with the word Svaha.\n\n87c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nAccording to Katyayana I, 2, 6-7, the _g_ uhotis are\n\np. 340\n\noffered sitting, the ya _g_ atis standing. See Sutra XCII. The _g_ uhoti acts\nconsist in pouring melted butter into the fire of the \xc3\x82havaniya altar, which\nis so called because 'ahuyante\xe0\xa4\xbdsminn ahutaya _h_ kshipyanta iti.'\n\n88\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXXVIII.\n\nTaking (the butter) once.\n\n89\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA LXXXIX.\n\nOr, if there are several \xc3\x82hutis, taking (the butter) for each \xc3\x82huti.\n\n90\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XC.\n\nOr, doing as he likes in dividing (the butter).\n\n90c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThese three Sutras belong together. They teach that one slice (avadana) of\nbutter should be taken, melted, and poured on the \xc3\x82havaniya fire; or, if there\nare more than one ahuti, then one slice should be taken for each. This,\nhowever, is made optional again by the last Sutra.\n\n91\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XCI.\n\nThere is no fuel (in the Darvi-homa), except at the Agnihotra.\n\n91c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nIn the case of the Agnihotra it is distinctly stated, dve samidhav adadhyat,\nlet him lay down two sticks.\n\n92\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XCII.\n\nOne pours out ( _g_ uhoti) the Darvi-homas, sitting west of the \xc3\x82havaniya\nfire, and bending the right knee, or not bending it.\n\n93\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XCIII.\n\nIf it is distinctly stated, it is done in a different way.\n\np. 341\n\n93c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe vidhi, contained in Sutra XCII, is therefore called autsargika, general,\nand liable to exceptions, as when it is said, that he turns to the east.\n\n94\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XCIV.\n\nOne pours out ( _g_ uhoti) all ahutis, west of the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, passing\n(the altar) southward, and then turning to the north.\n\n95\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XCV.\n\nThe \xc3\x82 _s_ ruta and Pratya _s_ ruta, the Ya _g_ ya and Anuvakya, the Upastara\n_n_ a and Abhighara _n_ a, with the slicings, the _K_ aturg _ri_ hita also,\nand the Vasha _t_ kara constitute the Darvi-homas.\n\n95c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe \xc3\x82 _s_ ruta is a _s_ ravaya; the Pratya _s_ ruta, astu _s_ rausha _t_ ;\nAnuvakya and Ya _g_ ya are verses, the first inviting the deity, the second\naccompanying the sacrifice. Whenever vegetable, animal, or sa _m_ nayya\nofferings have to be. sliced, upastara _n_ a, spreading, and abhighara _n_ a,\nsprinkling with fat, take place. With a _g_ ya offerings there is _K_ aturg\n_ri_ hita (taking four times), and the Vasha _t_ kara.\n\n96\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XCVI.\n\nWith ahutis one should let the act (the pouring out) take place after the\nVasha _t_ kara has been made, or while it is being made.\n\n96c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nThe Vasha _t_ kara consists in the word Vasha _t_ , to be uttered by the Hot\n_ri_ -priest. The five sacrificial interjections are, svaha, srausha _t_ ,\nvausha _t_ , vasha _t_ , and svadha.\n\n97\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XCVII.\n\nWith the Grahas the act should be made to coincide with the Upayama.\n\np. 342\n\n97c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nGrahas are offerings of Soma, and likewise the vessels (kamasa) in which the\nSoma is offered. The Soma is offered with the words upayama-g _ri_ hito\xe0\xa4\xbdsi,\nand while these words are being uttered, the fluid should be poured out (dhara\n_m_ sravayet).\n\n98\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XCVIII.\n\nWith the Ish _t_ akas, the act should be made to coincide with the words taya\ndeva tena.\n\n98c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nWhen the different ish _t_ akas or bricks are placed together for building an\naltar, &c., the act itself begins with the first and ends with the last words\nof the accompanying verse.\n\n99\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA XCIX.\n\nWhen there is a number of Puro _d_ a _s_ as, one should slice off one after\nanother, saying for each portion vyavartadhvam (separate)!\n\n99c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nPuro _d_ a _s_ a is a cake made of meal (pakva _h_ pish _t_ api _n_ _d_ a _h_\n), different from karu, which is more of a pulse consisting of grains of rice\nor barley, and clarified butter (gh _ri_ tata _n_ _d_ ulobhayatmakam). This\npuro _d_ a _s_ a cake has to be divided for presentation to different deities.\nIf there are more than two deities, the plural vyavartadhvam, separate, has to\nbe used.\n\n100\n\n### S\xc3\x9bTRA C.\n\nWhen the two last are sliced off, he should say for each portion,\nvyavartetham, separate ye two!\n\n100c\n\n**Commentary.**\n\nEach slice, avadana, is said to be about a thumb's breadth. In the case of sa\n_m_ nayya, the mixture of sour and sweet milk, a kind of coagulated sour milk,\neach portion is to be of the same breadth, but, as it is fluid, it is\n\np. 343\n\ntaken out with a ladle (sruva) of a corresponding size; see Katyayana I, 9, 7.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[337:1](sbe30122.htm#fr_798) Vaidya in his Dictionary explains it, however, as\nany substance mixed with clarified butter and offered as a burnt offering,\nwhich can hardly be right.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sutras 101-125](sbe30123.htm)\n\n"
