Narada said :-- O Dvaipayana! When the King Taladhvaja asked me thus, I\nthought over earnestly and said thus :-- \xc2\x93I do not know whose daughter I am;\nnor do I know quite certainly where are my father and mother; one man placed\nme here on this tank and has gone away, whither I do not know. O King! I am\nnow an helpless orphan; what shall I do now? Where to go? What to do by which\nI can have my welfare? I am all the while thinking on these. O King! The\nDestiny is powerful; I have not the least control over it; you know Dharma and\nyou are a King. Do now as you like. O King! Do nourish me; I have no father,\nno mother, nor any acquaintances and friends; there is no place for me also to\nstand on; therefore I am now your dependent.\xc2\x94 When I spoke thus, the King\nlooked at my face and became love-stricken for me; he then told his attendants\nto bring an excellent rectangular and spacious palanquin to be carried on four\nmen\xc2\x92s shoulders, gilt and adorned with jewels and pearls, where soft sheets\nwere spread inside and covered all over with silken cloths. Instantly the\nservants went away and brought for me a beautiful palanquin. I got on it to\nserve the best wishes of the King. The King also gladly took me home. In an\nauspicious day and in an auspicious moment he married me in accordance with\ndue rites and ceremonies in the presence of the Holy Fire.\n\n\n\n12\\. I became dearer to him than even his own life and the King, with great\nfondness, kept my name as Saubhagya Sundari.\n\n\n\n13-20. The King then began to sport with me amorously according to the rules\nof the Kama S\xc2\x92astra in various ways and with great enjoyments and pleasures.\nHe then left all his kingly duties and state affairs and he began to remain\nday and night with me deeply immersed in amorous sports;\n\n\n\np. 586\n\n\n\nso much his mind was merged in me in these plays that he could not notice the\nlong time that passed away in the interval. He used to drink the Varu _n_ i\nwine and, forsaking all the state affairs, began to enjoy me in nice gardens,\nbeautiful lakes, lovely palaces, beautified houses, excellent mountains and\nenviable forests and became completely subservient to me. O Dvaipayana! Being\nincessantly engaged with the King in amorous sports and remaining obedient to\nhim, my previous body, male ideas, or the birth of Muni, nothing whatsoever\ncame in my memory. I remained always attached to him, being obedient to him\nwith a view to be happy and I constantly thought over \xc2\x93that this King is very\nmuch attached to me, I am his dearest wife to all others; always he thinks of\nme, I am his chief consort, capable to give him enjoyment.\xc2\x94 My mind became\nentirely his and I completely forgot the eternal Brahmaj\xc3\xb1an and the knowledge\nof the Dharma S\xc2\x92astras.\n\n\n\n21-31. O Muni! Thus engaged in various amorous sports, twelve years passed\naway as if a moment and I could not perceive that. Then I became pregnant; and\nthe King became very glad and performed all the ceremonies pertaining to my\nimpregnation and holding of the child in my womb. In order to satisfy me, the\nKing used to ask me always what things I liked; I used to be very much\nabashed; seeing this, the King used to be still more glad. Ten months thus\npassed away and in an auspicious Lagna and when the asterism was favourably\nstrong, I gave birth to a son; the King became very glad and great festivities\nwere held on the birth ceremony of the child. O Dvaipayana! When the period of\nthe birth-impurity was over, the King saw the face of the child and was\ngreatly delighted; I then became the dearest wife of the King. Two years after\nagain I became impregnated; the second auspicious son was born. The King gave\nthe name Sudhanva to the second son and on the authority of the Brahmi _n_ s,\nkept the name of the eldest son as Viravarma. Thus I gave birth to twelve\nsons, in due course of time, to the King\xc2\x92s great liking; and I was engaged in\nrearing up those children and thus I remained enchanted. Again in due course,\nI gave birth to eight sons; thus my household was filled with happiness. The\nKing performed the marriage ceremonies of all those children duly and\nbefittingly; and our family became very large with sons and their wives.\n\n\n\n32-52. Then I had some grandsons and they increased my attachment and the\nconsequent delusion with their all sorts of playful sports. Sometimes I felt\nhappy and prosperous and sometimes I felt pain and sorrow when my sons fell\nill. Then my body and mind became very much troubled with sorrows. Again the\nquarrels amongst my sons and my daughters-in-\n\n\n\np. 587\n\n\n\nlaw, brought terrible pain and remorse in my mind. O Best of Munis! Thus I was\ngreatly immersed in the terrible ocean of these imaginary thoughts, sometimes\nhappy and sometimes painful, and I forgot my previous knowledge and the\nknowledge of the S\xc2\x92astras. I was merged in the thought of myself being a woman\nand lost myself entirely in doing the household affairs. I began to think\n\xc2\x93that I have so many daughters-in-law; so many powerful sons of mine are\nplaying together in my house; Oh! I am fortunate and full of merits amongst\nwomen\xc2\x94 and thus my egoistic pride increased. Not for a moment even occurred\nthe thought that I had been Narada; the Bhagavan had deceived me by His Maya.\nO Kri _sn_ a Dvaipayana! I was deluded by Maya and passed away my time in the\nthought \xc2\x93that I am the king\xc2\x92s wife, chaste and of good conduct following good\n\xc3\x82chara; I have so many sons and grandsons; I am blessed in this Samsara and\nthat I am so happy and prosperous.\xc2\x94 One powerful king of a distant country\nturned out an inveterate enemy of my husband and came to the city of Kanauj to\nfight with my husband, accompanied by chariots, and elephants and the fourfold\narmy. That enemy besieged the city with his army; my sons and grandsons went\nout and fought valiantly with him but owing to the great Destiny, the enemies\nkilled all my sons. The King retreated and returned to his palace. Next I\nheard that powerful King killed all my sons and grandsons and had gone back to\nhis country with his army. I then hurriedly went to the battlefield, crying\nloudly. O Long-lived One! Seeing my sons and grandsons lying on the ground, in\nthat horrible and distressed state, I became merged in the ocean of sorrows\nand lamented and wept loudly and wildly, \xc2\x93O my Sons! Where have you gone\nleaving me thus? Alas! The pernicious Fate is very dominant, and very\npainsgiving and indomitable. It has killed me today.\xc2\x94 By this time, the\nBhagavan Madhusudana came to me there in the garb of a beautiful aged Brahmi\n_n_. His dress was sacred and lovely; it seemed he was versed in the Vedas.\nSeeing me weeping distressedly in the battlefield he said :-- \xc2\x93O Devi! O\ncuckoo-voiced One! It seems you are the mistress of a prosperous house and you\nhave got husband and sons! O thin-bodied One! Why are you thus lamenting and\nfeeling yourself distressed! All this is simply illusion caused by Moha;\nthink; who are you? whose sons are these? Now think of your best hereafter;\nDon\xc2\x92t weep, get up and be comfortable, O Good-eyed one!\n\n\n\n53-54. O Devi! To shew respect to your sons, etc., gone to the other worlds,\noffer them water and Til. The friends of the deceased ought to take their bath\nin a place of pilgrimage; never they should bathe in their houses. Know this\nas ordained by Dharma.\n\n\n\np. 588\n\n\n\n55-66. Narada said :-- O Dvaipayan! When the old Brahmi _n_ thus addressed me,\nI and the King and other friends got up. The Bhagavan Madhusudana causing this\ncreation, in the form of a Brahma _n_ a, led the way and I followed him\nquickly to that sacred place of pilgrimage. The Vi _sn_ u Bhagavan, the Lord\nJanardana Hari, in the form of a Brahmi _n_ , kindly took me to the tank named\nPumtirtha (male tirtha) and said :-- \xc2\x93O One going like an elephant! Better\ntake your bath in this tank; forego your sorrows that are of no use; now the\ntime has arrived to offer water to your sons. Better think that you had\nmillions of sons born to you in your previous births and for that your\nmillions of sons and daughters lost their lives; you had millions of fathers,\nhusbands, and brothers and you lost them again; O Devi! Now tell me for whom\nyou will now grieve? All these, then, are merely mental phenomena; this world\nis full of delusion, false like a mirage and dream-like; the embodied souls,\nsimply get pains and sorrows and nothing else.\xc2\x94 Narada said :-- On hearing his\nwords, I went to bathe in that Pumtirtha, as ordered by him. Taking a dip, I\nfound that, in an instant, I became a man; the Bhagavan Hari, in his own\nproper form, was standing on the edge with a lute in his hand. O Brahmi _n_!\nWhen getting out of the water, I came to the bank and saw the lotus-eyed Kri\n_sn_ a, pure consciousness then flashed in my heart. Then I thought \xc2\x93that I am\nNarada; I have come to this place and being deluded by the Maya of Hari, I got\nthe female form.\xc2\x94 When I was thinking thus, Hari exclaimed, \xc2\x93O Narada! Get up;\nwhat are you doing, standing in the water?\xc2\x94 I was astonished; and,\nrecollecting my feminine nature, very severe indeed, began to think why I was\nagain transformed into a male form.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-ninth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the Narada\xc2\x92s getting\nagain his male form in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 30](bk06ch30.htm)\n\n'
