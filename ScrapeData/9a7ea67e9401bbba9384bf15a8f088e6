Prayer to Arbudi and Nyarbudi for help in battle.\n\n1\\. The arms, the arrows, and the might of the bows; the swords, the axes, the\nweapons, and the artful scheme that is in our mind; all that, O Arbudi, do\nthou make the enemies see, and spectres also make them see!  \n2\\. Arise, and arm yourselves; friends are ye, O divine folk! May our friends\nbe perceived and protected by you, O Arbudi (and Nyarbudi)!  \n3\\. Arise (ye two), and take hold! With fetters and shackles surround ye the\narmies of the enemy, O Arbudi (and Nyarbudi)!  \n4\\. The god whose name is Arbudi, and the lord Nyarbudi, by whom the\natmosphere and this great earth has been infolded, with these two companions\nof Indra do I pursue the conquered (king) with my army.  \n5\\. Arise, thou divine person, O Arbudi, together with thy army! Crushing the\narmy of tlie enemy, encompass them with thy embraces!  \n6\\. Thou, Arbudi, makest appear the sevenfold spectral brood. Do thou, when\nthe oblation has been poured, rise up with all. these, together with the army!  \n7\\. (The female mourner), beating herself, with tear-stained face, with short\n(mutilated?) ears, with dishevelled hair, shall lament, when a man has been\nslain, pierced by thee, O Arbudi!  \n8\\. She curves her spine while longing in her heart for her son, her husband,\nand her kin, when (a man) has been pierced by thee, O Arbudi!  \n9\\. The aliklavas and the gashkamadas, the vultures, the strong-winged hawks,\nthe crows, and the birds (of prey) shall obtain their fill! Let them make\nevident to the enemy, when (a man) has been pierced by thee, O Arbudi!  \n10\\. Then, too, every wild beast, insect, and worm shall obtain his fill on\nthe human carcass, when (a man) has been pierced by thee, O Arbudi!  \n11\\. Seize ye, and tear out in-breathing and outbreathing, O Nyarbudi (and\nArbudi): deep-sounding groans shall arise! Let them make it evident to the\nenemy, when (a man) has been pierced by thee, O Arbudi!  \n12\\. Scare them forth, let them tremble; bewilder the enemies with fright!\nWith thy broad embrace, with the clasp of thy arms crush the enemies, O\nNyarbudi!  \n13\\. May their arms, and the artful scheme that is in their mind be confused!\nNot a thing shall remain of them, pierced by thee, O Arbudi!  \n14\\. May (the mourning women) beating them selves, run together, smiting their\nbreasts and their thighs, not anointed, with dishevelled hair, howling, when a\nman has been slain, has been pierced by thee, O Arbudi!  \n15\\. The dog-like Apsaras, and also the Rupakas (phantoms), the plucking\nsprite, that eacerly licks within the vessel, and her that seeks out what has\nbeen carelessly hidden, all those do thou, O Arbudi, make the enemies see, and\nspectres also make them see!  \n16\\. (And also make them see) her that strides upon the mist, the mutilated\none, who dwells with the mutilated; the vapoury spooks that are hidden, and\nthe Gandharvas and Apsaras, the serpents, and other brood, and the Rakshas!  \n17\\. (And also) the spooks with fourfold teeth, black teeth, testicles like a\npot, bloody faces, who are inherently frightful, and terrifying!  \n18\\. Frighten thou, O Arbudi, yonder lines of the enemy; the conquering and\nthe victorious (Arbudi and Nyarbudi), the two comrades of Indra, shall conquer\nthe enemies!  \n19\\. Dissolved, crushed, slain the enemy shall lie, O Nyarbudi! May victorious\nsprites, with fiery tongues and smoky crests, go with (our) army!  \n20\\. Of the enemies repulsed by this (army), O Arbudi, Indra, the spouse of\nSaki, shall slay each picked man: not a single one of those yonder shall\nescape!  \n21\\. May their hearts burst, may their life's breath escape upward! May\ndryness of the mouth overtake (our) enemies, but not (our) allies!  \n22\\. Those who are bold and those who are cowardly, those who turn (in flight)\nand those who are deaf (to danger?), those who are (like) dark goats, and\nthose, too, who bleat like goats, all those, do thou, O Arbudi, make the\nenemies see, and spectres also make them see!  \n23\\. Arbudi and Trishamdhi shall pierce our enemies, so that, O Indra, slayer\nof Vritra, spouse of Saki, we may slay the enemy by thousands!  \n24\\. The trees, and (growths) that are like trees, the plants and the herbs as\nwell, the Gandharvas and the Apsaras, the serpents, gods, pious men, and\n(departed) Fathers, all those, O Arbudi, do thou make the enemies see, and\nspectres also make them see!  \n25\\. The Maruts, god \xc3\x82ditya, Brahmanaspati did rule over you; Indra, and Agni,\nDhatar, Mitra, and Pragapati did rule over you; the seers did rule over you.\nLet them make evident to the enemies when (a man) has been pierced by thee, O\nArbudi!  \n26\\. Ruling over all these, rise ye and arm yourselves! Ye divine folk are\n(our) friends: win ye the battle, and disperse to your various abodes!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 10.
