When merchandise has been sold for a (certain) price and is not delivered to the purchaser, it is termed Non-delivery of a Sold Chattel, a title of law.\n\n* 2. Property in this world is of two kinds, movable and immovable. All that is termed merchandise in the laws regarding purchase and sale.\n\n* 3. 3 The rule regarding the gift and receipt of\n\np. 147\n\nmerchandise is declared sixfold by the learned: (what is sold) by tale, by\nweight, by measure, according to work, according to its beauty, and according\nto its splendour.\n\n* 4. 4 If a man sells property for a certain price, and does not hand it over to the purchaser, he shall have to pay its produce, if it is immovable, and the profits arising on it, if it is movable property.\n\n* 5. 5 If there has been a fall in the market value of the article in question (in the interval, the purchaser) shall receive both the article itself, and together with it the difference (in point of value). This law applies to those who are inhabitants of the same place; but to those who travel abroad, the\n\np. 148\n\nprofit arising from (dealing in) foreign countries shall be made over (as\nwell).\n\n* 6. 6 If the article (sold) should have been injured, or destroyed by fire, or carried off, the loss shall be charged to the seller, because he did not deliver it after it had been sold by him.\n\n* 7. When a man shows one thing, which is faultless (to the intending purchaser), and (afterwards) delivers another thing to him, which has a blemish, he shall be compelled to pay twice its value (to the purchaser), and an equal amount as a fine.\n\n* 8. 8 So when a man sells something to one person, and (afterwards) delivers it to another person, he shall be compelled to pay twice its value (to the purchaser), and a fine to the king.\n\n* 9. 9 When a purchaser does not accept an article purchased by himself, which is delivered to him (by the vendor), the vendor commits no wrong by selling it to a different person.\n\n* 10. 10 Thus has the rule been declared with regard\n\np. 149\n\nto that merchandise for which the price has been tendered. When the price has\nnot been tendered, there is no offence to be imputed to the vendor, except in\nthe case of a special agreement.\n\n* 11. It is for the sake of gain that merchants are in the habit of buying and selling merchandise of every sort. That gain is, in proportion to the price, either great or the reverse.\n\n* 12. Therefore shall merchants fix a just price for their merchandise, according to the locality and season, and let them refrain from dishonest dealings. Thus (by adhering to these principles) traffic becomes an honest profession.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[146:3](sbe3340.htm#fr_434) VIII, 3. \'Gift\' means sale. \'Receipt\' means\npurchase. What p. 147 is counted before selling it is said to be sold \'by\ntale.\' Betel-nuts may be mentioned as an instance. \'What is sold by weight,\'\nsuch as gold or sandal-wood and the like substances, which are weighed on a\npair of scales. \'What is sold by measure,\' such as rice or the like. \'By\nwork,\' such as animals giving milk or used for draught or burden. \'According\nto its beauty,\' something handsome, as e.g. a handsome prostitute. \'According\nto its splendour,\' or lustre, as e.g. rubies. Viramitrodaya, p. 437. A similar\nexposition is delivered in the Ratnakara, as quoted in Colebrooke\'s Digest,\nIII, 3, 3.\n\n[147:4](sbe3340.htm#fr_435) \'The profits arising on it,\' such as e.g. the milk\nof a cow. Viramitrodaya, p. 437. The Vivada _k_ intama _n_ i (p. 55) and the\nRatnakara, as quoted in Colebrooke\'s Digest (III, 3, 18), take the term\nkriyaphalam as a Dvandva compound, denoting \'the work, such as the carrying of\nburdens and the like, and the profits, such as milk and the like.\' Vish _n_ u\nV, 127; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 254.\n\n[147:5](sbe3340.htm#fr_436) The previous paragraph contains the rule for those\ncases where the value of the property has increased after its sale. The\npresent rule refers to. those cases where the value of the property has\ndiminished after the sale. Viramitrodaya, p. 437. Those who travel abroad,\ni.e. who are in the habit of visiting other countries (for trading purposes),\nmay claim the profit which might have accrued to them from travelling abroad.\nVivada _k_ intama _n_ i, pp. 55, 56. Vish _n_ u V, 129; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II,\n254.\n\n[148:6](sbe3340.htm#fr_437) According to _G_ agannatha, this rule has\nreference to those cases only where the purchaser has not formally asked for\nthe delivery of the property purchased by himself. He infers from a text of Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya that after a demand the loss shall fall on the vendor, even\nthough the property was injured in one of the modes mentioned by that\nauthority, i.e. by force majeure. See Colebrooke\'s Digest, III, 3, 27. It is\nquite doubtful, however, whether the compiler of the Narada-sm _ri_ ti had\nthis distinction in view. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 256.\n\n[148:8](sbe3340.htm#fr_438) 8, 9. Both he who shows unblemished goods, and\nsells blemished goods afterwards, and he who sells property to one man and\nafterwards sells the same property to another man, though the first sale has\nnot been rescinded by the purchaser, shall pay twice the value of the property\nsold as a fine. Viramitrodaya, p. 440. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 257.\n\n[148:9](sbe3340.htm#fr_439) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 255.\n\n[148:10](sbe3340.htm#fr_440) Consequently, where there is no agreement as to\nthe time of p. 149 delivery, the vendor commits no wrong by retaining a\ncommodity sold, on purpose to obtain payment. Thus according to the gloss in\nColebrooke\'s Digest, III, 3, 20. The Viramitrodaya (p. 441) has a slightly\ndifferent explanation. \'Where the price for a sold chattel has not been paid,\nand the purchase concluded through a verbal engagement merely, there is no\noffence whether it be ratified or not, unless there should be an agreement in\nthis form, "This purchase cannot be rescinded."\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Ninth Title of Law.
