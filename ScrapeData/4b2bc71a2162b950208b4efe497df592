At the tip of my tongue may I have honey, at my tongue's root the\nsweetness of honey! In my power alone shalt thou then be, thou shalt come up\nto my wish!  \n3\\. Sweet as honey is my entrance, sweet as honey my departure. With my voice\ndo I speak sweet as honey, may I become like honey!  \n4\\. I am sweeter than honey, fuller of sweetness than licorice. Mayest thou,\nwithout fail, long for me alone, (as a bee) for a branch full of honey!  \n5\\. I have surrounded thee with a clinging sugarcane, to remove aversion, so\nthat thou shalt not be averse to me!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 30. Charm to secure the love of a woman](av115.htm)\n\n"
