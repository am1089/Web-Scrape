The oblation to the gods accompanied by the exclamation Svaha, which may\nconsist even of a piece of wood only; the offering to the Manes accompanied by\nthe exclamation Svadha, which may consist even of a vessel with water only;\nthe daily recitation. 1\n\n2\\. Respect must be shown to those who are superior by caste, 2\n\n3\\. And also to (persons of the same caste who are) venerable (on account of\nlearning, virtue, and the like).\n\n4\\. A man elated (with success) becomes proud, a proud man transgresses the\nlaw, but through the transgression of the law hell indeed (becomes his\nportion).\n\n5\\. It has not been declared, that orders (may be addressed by the teacher) to\na pupil who has returned home. 5\n\n6\\. The syllable \'Om\' is the door of heaven. 6\n\np. 49\n\n[paragraph continues] Therefore he who is about to study the Veda, shall begin\n(his lesson) by (pronouncing) it.\n\n7\\. If he has spoken anything else (than what refers to the lesson, he shall\nresume his reading by repeating the word \'Om\'). Thus the Veda is separated\nfrom profane speech.\n\n8\\. And at sacrifices the orders (given to the priests) are headed by this\nword.\n\n9\\. And in common life, at the occasion of ceremonies performed for the sake\nof welfare, the sentences shall be headed by this word, as, for instance,\n\'(Om) an auspicious day,\' \'(Om) welfare,\' \'(Om) prosperity.\' 9\n\n10\\. Without a vow of obedience (a pupil) shall not study (nor a teacher\nteach) a difficult (new book) with the exception of (the texts called) Tri _h_\nsrava _n_ a and Tr.ihsahava _k_ ana. 10\n\n11\\. Harita declares, that the (whole) Veda must be studied under a vow of\nobedience until there is no doubt (regarding it in the mind of the pupil). 11\n\np. 50\n\n12\\. No obedience is due (to the teacher for teaching) works which do not\nbelong to the Veda.\n\n13\\. (A student) shall embrace the feet of a person, who teaches him at the\nrequest of his (regular teacher), as long as the instruction lasts. 13\n\n14\\. Some (declare, that he shall also) always, (if the substitute is) a\nworthy person. 14\n\n15\\. But obedience (as towards the teacher) is not required (to be shown\ntowards such a person).\n\n16\\. And (pupils) older (than their teacher need not show him obedience). 16\n\n17\\. If (two persons) teach each other mutually (different redactions of) the\nVeda, obedience (towards each other) is not ordained for them.\n\n18\\. (For) the (wise) say, \'The Veda-knowledge (of either of them) grows.\'\n\n19\\. _S_ vetaketu declares, \'He who desires to study more, after having\nsettled (as a householder), shall dwell two months every year, with collected\nmind, in the house of his teacher,\'\n\n20\\. (And he adds), \'For by this means I studied a larger part of the Veda\nthan before, (during my studentship.)\'\n\n21\\. That is forbidden by the _S_ astras.\n\n22\\. For after the student has settled as a householder, he is ordered by the\nVeda, to perform the daily rites,\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[48:1](sbe0216.htm#fr_312) **13**. Taitt. \xc3\x82r. II, 10, 2 and 3, and _S_\natapatha-br. loc. cit. 2. Haradatta observes, that some consider the Devaya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, mentioned in the Sutra, to be different from the Vai _s_ vadeva,\nbut that he holds it to be the same. Further he mentions, that some prescribe\nthis Vai _s_ vadeva to be performed even if one has nothing to eat.\n\n[48:2](sbe0216.htm#fr_313) \'Namely, by allowing them to walk in front on the\nroad and by giving them perfumed garlands and the like at festive occasions.\'\n--Haradatta.\n\n[48:5](sbe0216.htm#fr_314) Haradatta gives as an example the order to fetch\nwater, and adds that a voluntary act on a former pupil\'s part ought not to be\nforbidden.\n\n[48:6](sbe0216.htm#fr_315) Compare also Taitt. \xc3\x82r. I, 2, 4, and Manu II, 74.\n\n[49:9](sbe0216.htm#fr_316) The example given in the Sutra is that of the Pu\n_n_ yahava _k_ ana, which precedes every G _ri_ hya ceremony, and at which the\nsacrificer requests a number of invited Brahma _n_ as to wish him success. The\ncomplete sentences are, The sacrificer: O _m_ karma _n_ a _h_ pu _n_ yaham\nbhavanto bruvantviti, \'Om, wish that the day may be auspicious for the\nperformance of the ceremony.\' The Brahma _n_ as: Om pu _n_ yaha _m_ karma _n_\na iti, \'Om, may the day be auspicious for the ceremony.\' In the same manner\nthe Brahma _n_ as afterwards wish \'welfare,\' svasti, \'prosperity,\' v _ri_\nddhi, to the sacrificer.\n\n[49:10](sbe0216.htm#fr_317) Manu II, 112.\n\n[49:11](sbe0216.htm#fr_318) The meaning of Harita is, that the vow of\nobedience is required for the Tri _h_ srava _n_ a and Tr.ihsahava _k_ ana,\nwhich \xc3\x82pastamba exempted in the preceding Sutra. It follows from this rule\nthat the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas or works explanatory of the Veda need not be studied under a\nvow of obedience.\n\n[50:13](sbe0216.htm#fr_319) This rule is a Supplement to I, 2, 7, 29.\n\n[50:14](sbe0216.htm#fr_320) \'"A worthy person," i.e. on account of his\nlearning, or character.\'-- Haradatta.\n\n[50:16](sbe0216.htm#fr_321) \'According to some, this rule refers only to the\ntime after instruction has been completed; according to others, to the time of\nstudentship.\'--Haradatta. But see Manu II, 151 seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 4, Kha _n_ _d_ a 14](sbe0217.htm)\n\n'
