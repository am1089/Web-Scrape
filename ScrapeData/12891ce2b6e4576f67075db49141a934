But by the meditation on the highest that which is hidden (viz. the\nequality of the Lord and\n\np. 139\n\nthe soul, becomes manifest); for from him (the Lord) are its (the soul's)\nbondage and release.\n\nWell, but the individual soul is a part of the highest Self as the spark is a\npart of the fire. And as fire and spark have in common the powers of burning\nand giving light, so the individual soul and the Lord have in common the\npowers of knowledge and rulership; hence the individual soul may, by means of\nits lordship, effect in the dreaming state a creation of chariots and the\nlike, springing from its wishes (sa _m_ kalpa).--To this we reply that\nalthough the Lord and the individual soul stand to each other in the relation\nof whole and part, yet it is manifest to perception that the attributes of the\ntwo are of a different nature.--Do you then mean to say that the individual\nsoul has no common attributes with the Lord?--We do not maintain that; but we\nsay that the equality of attributes, although existing, is hidden by the veil\nof Nescience. In the case of some persons indeed who strenuously meditate on\nthe Lord and who, their ignorance being dispelled at last, obtain through the\nfavour of the Lord extraordinary powers and insight, that hidden equality\nbecomes manifest--just as through the action of strong medicines the power of\nsight of a blind man becomes manifest; but it does not on its own account\nreveal itself to all men.--Why not?--Because 'from him,' i.e. from the Lord\nthere are bondage and release of it, viz. the individual soul. That means:\nbondage is due to the absence of knowledge of the Lord's true nature; release\nis due to the presence of such knowledge. Thus _S_ ruti declares, 'When that\ngod is known all fetters fall off; sufferings are destroyed and birth and\ndeath cease. From meditating on him there arises, on the dissolution of the\nbody, a third state, that of universal Lordship; he who is alone is satisfied'\n( _S_ vet. Up. I, 11), and similar passages.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[138:1](sbe38107.htm#fr_103) Svaya _m_ vihatya purvadeha _m_ ni _s_ _k_ esh\n_t_ a _m_ k _ri_ tva svaya _m_ nirmayapurva _m_ vasanamaya _m_ deha _m_\nsampadya svena bhasa svakiyabuddhiv _ri_ ttya svena _g_ yotisha svarupa _k_\naitanyenety artha _h_. \xc3\x82n.
