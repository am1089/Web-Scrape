The two others (i.e. the individual soul and the pradhana) are not (the\nsource of all beings) because there are stated distinctive attributes and\ndifference.\n\nThe source of all beings is the highest Lord, not either of the two others,\nviz. the pradhana and the individual soul, on account of the following reason\nalso. In the first place, the text distinguishes the source of all beings from\nthe embodied soul, as something of a different nature; compare the passage\n(II, i, 2), 'That heavenly person is without body, he is both without and\nwithin, not produced, without breath and without mind, pure.' The distinctive\nattributes mentioned here, such as being of a heavenly nature, and so on, can\nin no way belong to the individual soul,\n\np. 140\n\nwhich erroneously considers itself to be limited by name and form as presented\nby Nescience, and erroneously imputes their attributes to itself. Therefore\nthe passage manifestly refers to the Person which is the subject of all the\nUpanishads.--In the second place, the source of all beings which forms the\ngeneral topic is represented in the text as something different from the\npradhana, viz. in the passage, 'Higher than the high Imperishable.' Here the\nterm 'Imperishable' means that undeveloped entity which represents the seminal\npotentiality of names and forms, contains the fine parts of the material\nelements, abides in the Lord, forms his limiting adjunct, and being itself no\neffect is high in comparison to all effects; the whole phrase, 'Higher than\nthe high Imperishable,' which expresses a difference then clearly shows that\nthe highest Self is meant here.--We do not on that account assume an\nindependent entity called pradhana and say that the source of all beings is\nstated separately therefrom; but if a pradhana is to be assumed at all (in\nagreement with the common opinion) and if being assumed it is assumed of such\na nature as not to be opposed to the statements of Scripture, viz. as the\nsubtle cause of all beings denoted by the terms 'the Undeveloped' and so on,\nwe have no objection to such an assumption, and declare that, on account of\nthe separate statement therefrom, i.e. from that pradhana, 'the source of all\nbeings' must mean the highest Lord.--A further argument in favour of the same\nconclusion is supplied by the next Sutra.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 23](sbe34060.htm)\n\n"
