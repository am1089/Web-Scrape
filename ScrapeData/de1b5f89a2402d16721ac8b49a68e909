GANESA.\n\nGANESA is usually regarded as the elder son of Siva and P\xc4\x81rvati, but the\nPur\xc4\x81nas differ very considerably in their\n\n[![GANESA.](tn/32300.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/32300.jpg)  \nGANESA.  \n\naccounts of his origin. Sir W. Jones says * that " Ganesa, the Indian god of\nWisdom, has the same\n\np. 324\n\ncharacteristics as Janus of the Latins. All sacrifices and religious\nceremonies, all serious compositions in writing, and all worldly affairs of\nimportance are begun by pious Hindus with an invocation to Ganesa; a word\ncomposed of Isa, the governor or leader, and gana, a company (of deities).\nInstances of opening business auspiciously by an ejaculation to him might be\nmultiplied with ease. Few books are begun without the words, \'Salutation to\nGanesa;\' and he is first invoked by Br\xc4\x81hmans who conduct the trial by ordeal,\nor perform the ceremony of the homa or sacrifice to fire." M. Sonnerat\nrepresents him as highly revered on the coast of Coromandel, where, according\nto him, "the Indians would not on any account build a house without having\nplaced on the ground an image of this deity, which they sprinkle with oil and\nadorn every day with flowers. They set up his image in all their temples, in\nthe streets, in the high roads, and in the open plains at the foot of some\ntree, so that persons of all ranks may invoke him before they undertake any\nbusiness, and travellers worship him before they proceed on a journey." What\nis true of the Coromandel coast, is true of most parts of India so far as the\nworship of this deity is concerned.\n\n"Ganesa is the Hindu god of Prudence and Policy. He is the reputed eldest son\nof Siva and P\xc4\x81rvati (the \'Padma Pur\xc4\x81na\' alone declares that he was the actual\nchild of these deities), and is represented with an elephant\'s head--an emblem\nof sagacity--and is frequently attended by, or is riding upon, a rat. He has\ngenerally four hands, but sometimes six, or eight, or only two." * He is\nalways described as being very corpulent; and pictures or images of him are\nseen over the doors of most shopkeepers. It is not easy to see why Ganesa\n\np. 325\n\nhas become so universally worshipped, as there are few legends in the Pur\xc4\x81nas\nattesting his divine power.\n\nThe "Brahm\xc4\x81vaivarta Pur\xc4\x81na" * gives the following account of his\nbirth:--"P\xc4\x81rvati, after her marriage with Siva, being without a child, and\nvery desirous to obtain one, was advised by her husband to perform the\nPany\xc4\x81kavr\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81. This is the worship of Vishnu, to be begun on the thirteenth day\nof the bright fortnight of M\xc4\x81gha, and continued for a year, on every day of\nwhich flowers, fruits, cakes, vessels, gems, gold, etc., are to be presented,\nand a thousand Br\xc4\x81hmans fed; and the performer of the rite is to observe most\ncarefully a life of inward purity, and to fix the mind on Hari (Vishnu).\nP\xc4\x81rvati having, with the aid of Sanat Kum\xc4\x81ra, as directing priest,\naccomplished the ceremony on the banks of the Ganges, returns after some\ninterval, in which she sees Krishna, first as a body of light, and afterwards\nas an old Br\xc4\x81hman, come to her dwelling. The reward of her religious zeal\nbeing delayed, she is plunged in grief, when a viewless voice tells her to go\nto her apartment, where she will find a son who is the lord of Goloka, or\nKrishna, that deity having assumed the semblance of her son as a recompense\nfor her devotions.\n\n"In compliment to this occasion, all the gods came to congratulate Siva and\nP\xc4\x81rvati, and were severally admitted to see the infant. Amidst the splendid\ncohort was Sand, the planet Saturn, who, although anxious to pay his homage to\nthe child, kept his eyes stedfastly fixed on the ground. P\xc4\x81rvati asking him\nthe reason of this, he told her that, being immersed in meditation upon\nVishnu, he had disregarded the caresses of his wife, and in resentment of his\nneglect, she had denounced upon him the curse that whomsoever he gazed upon he\nshould\n\np. 326\n\ndestroy. To obviate the evil consequences of this imprecation, he avoided\nlooking any one in the face. Parvati, having heard his story, paid no regard\nto it, but, considering that what must be, must be, gave him\n\npermission to look on her son. Sani, calling Dharma to witness his having\nleave, took a peep at Ganesa, on which the child\'s head was severed from his\nbody, and flew away to the heaven of Krishna, where it re-united with the\nsubstance of him of whom it formed a part.\n\n"Durg\xc4\x81, taking the headless trunk in her arms, cast herself weeping on the\nground, and the gods thought it decent to follow her example, all except\nVishnu, who mounted Garuda, and flew off to the river Pushpabhadra, where,\nfinding an elephant asleep, he took off his head, and, flying back with it,\nclapped it on to the body of Ganesa; hence the body of that deity is crowned\nwith its present uncouth capital. On the restoration of Ganesa to life,\nvaluable gifts were made to the gods and Br\xc4\x81hmans by the parents, and by\nP\xc4\x81rvati\'s father, the personified Him\xc4\x81laya. The unfortunate Sani was again\nanathematized, and, in consequence of P\xc4\x81rvati\'s curse, has limped ever since.\n\n"In another part of the same Pur\xc4\x81na, further particulars are given somewhat at\nvariance with the above. Siva, offended with Aditya (the sun), slew him, and\nalthough he restored him to life incurred the wrath of the sage Kasyapa, who\ndoomed his (Siva\'s) son to lose his head. The elephant whose head was placed\nupon Ganesa\'s body was Indra\'s elephant, which was decapitated because Indra\nthrew over his neck the garland of flowers which the sage Durvasas gave him,\nand the disrespect of which, with the consequent degradation of Indra, is\nnoticed in various Pur\xc4\x81nas, although with different results. Indra was no\nloser of an elephant by\n\np. 327\n\nthis transaction, as Vishnu, moved by the prayers of his wife, gave him\nanother in place of that which he took away.\n\n"Ganesa has only one tusk, and hence is called Ekadanta. The reason of this is\nas follows:--Parasur\xc4\x81ma, who was a favourite disciple of Siva, went to Kailasa\nto visit his master. On arriving at the inner apartment, his entrance was\nopposed by Ganesa, as his father was asleep. Parasur\xc4\x81ma nevertheless urged his\nway, and, after a long dialogue, the two came to blows. Ganesa had at first\nthe advantage, seizing Parasur\xc4\x81ma in his trunk, and giving him a twirl that\nleft him sick and senseless. On recovering, R\xc4\x81ma threw his axe at Ganesa, who,\nrecognizing it as his father\'s weapon--Siva having given it to Parasur\xc4\x81ma--\nreceived it with all humility upon one of his tusks, which it immediately\nsevered, and hence Ganesa has but one tusk. P\xc4\x81rvati was highly incensed at\nthis, and was about to curse R\xc4\x81ma, when Krishna, of whom he was a worshipper,\nappeared as a boy and appeased her indignation. Brahm\xc4\x81 is said to have\npromised that her son should be worshipped before the other gods. This result\nof his contest with R\xc4\x81ma was in consequence of a curse pronounced upon him by\nthe sage Tulasi, with whom he had quarrelled."\n\nWe have quite a different account of the origin of Ganesa in the "Matsya\nPur\xc4\x81na." * When P\xc4\x81rvati was bathing, she took the oil and ointments used at\nthe bath, together with the impurities that came from her body, and formed\nthem into the figure of a man, to which she gave life by sprinkling it with\nthe water of the Ganges. This figure had the head of the elephant. The "Siva\nPur\xc4\x81na" relates that, after giving Ganesa life, P\xc4\x81rvati placed him at her door\nto prevent intrusion\n\np. 328\n\nwhilst she was bathing. On his refusal to allow Siva to enter, a struggle\nensued, in which that deity cut off Ganesa\'s head; but when P\xc4\x81rvati showed her\nhusband that it was by her orders that the door was closed, and wept because\nof the loss of her son, Siva ordered the first head that could be found to be\nbrought to him; this happened to be an elephant\'s, which he fitted to the\nheadless trunk and resuscitated his son.\n\nIn the "V\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ha Pur\xc4\x81na" * Ganesa is said to have been produced by Siva alone.\n"The immortals and holy sages observing that no difficulty occurred in\naccomplishing good or evil deeds which they and others commenced, consulted\ntogether respecting the means by which obstacles might be opposed to the\ncommission of bad actions, and repaired to Siva for counsel, to whom they\nsaid: \'O Mah\xc4\x81deva! God of gods, three eyed, bearer of the trident, it is thou\nalone who canst create a being capable of opposing obstacles to the commission\nof improper acts.\' Hearing these words, Siva looked at P\xc4\x81rvati, and whilst\nthinking how he could effect the wishes of the gods, from the splendour of his\ncountenance there sprang into existence a youth shedding radiance around,\nendowed with the qualities of Siva, and evidently another Rudra, and\ncaptivating by his beauty the female inhabitants of heaven.\n\n"Um\xc4\x81 seeing his beauty was excited with jealousy, and in her anger pronounced\nthis curse: \'Thou shalt not offend my sight with the form of a beautiful\nyouth; therefore assume an elephant\'s head and a large belly, and thus shall\nall thy beauties vanish.\' Siva then addressed his son, saying, \'Thy name shall\nbe Ganesa, and the son of Siva; thou shalt be chief of the Vinayakas and\nGanas; success and disappointment shall\n\np. 329\n\nspring from thee; and great shall be thine influence amongst the gods, and in\nsacrifices and all affairs. Therefore shalt thou be worshipped and invoked the\nfirst on all occasions, otherwise the object and prayers of him who omits to\ndo so shall fail.\n\n"The origin and purpose of Ganesa\'s existence are more fully taught in the\nSkanda. * Siva addressing P\xc4\x81rvati says, "During the twilight that intervened\nbetween the Dwarpara and K\xc4\x81li Yugas, women, barbarians, Sudras, and other\nworkers of sin obtained entrance to heaven by visiting the celebrated shrine\nof Someswara (Somn\xc4\x81th). Sacrifices, ascetic practices, charitable gifts, and\nall the other prescribed ordinances ceased, and men thronged only to the\ntemple of Siva. Hence old and young, those skilled in the Vedas and those\nignorant of them, and even women and Sudras, ascended to heaven, until at\nlength it became crowded to excess. Then Indra and the gods, afflicted because\nthus overcome by men, sought the protection of Siva, and thus addressed him:\n\'O Sankara! by thy favour heaven is crowded with men, and we are nearly\nexpelled from it. These mortals wander wherever they please, exclaiming, "1 am\nthe greatest, I am the greatest; " and Dharmar\xc4\x81ja (Yama), beholding the\nregister of their good and evil deeds, is lost in astonishment. The seven\nhells were intended for their reception; but, having visited thy shrine, their\nsins have been remitted, and they have attained to a most excellent future!\'\nSiva replied, Such was my promise to Soma, nor can it be infringed; all men,\ntherefore, who visit the temple of Someswara must ascend to heaven; but\nsupplicate P\xc4\x81rvati, and she will contrive some means for extricating you from\nthis distress.\'\n\np. 330\n\n"The gods then invoked P\xc4\x81rvati in laudatory strains: \'Praise be to thee, O\nsupreme of goddesses! Supporter of the universe, praise be to thee, who\ncreatest and destroyest! Grant us thy aid, and save us from this distress!\'\nHaving heard the prayer of Indra and the gods, thou, O goddess! wert moved\nwith compassion; and gently rubbing thy body, there was produced a wondrous\nbeing with four arms and an elephant\'s head, and then thou didst thus address\nthe gods: \'Desirous of your advantage, have I created this being, who will\noccasion obstacles to men, and, deluding them, will deprive them of the wish\nto visit Somn\xc4\x81th, and thus shall they fall into hell.\' Hearing this, the gods\nreturned to their homes delighted.\n\n"The Elephant-faced then, addressing Devi, said, \'Command, O lovely goddess!\nwhat shall I now do?\' Thou didst reply, \'Oppose obstacles to men\'s visiting\nSomn\xc4\x81th, and entice them to give up such a purpose by the allurements of\nwives, children, possessions, and wealth. But from those who propitiate thee\nwith the following hymn, do thou remove all obstacles, and enable them to\nobtain the favour of Siva, by worshipping his shrine at Somn\xc4\x81th:--"Om, I\npraise thee, O lord of difficulties! The beloved spouse of Siddhi (knowledge)\nand Buddhi (understanding); Ganapati, invincible, and the giver of victory;\nthe opposer of obstacles to the success of men who do not worship thee! I\npraise thee, O Ganesa! The dreadful son of Um\xc4\x81, but firm and easily\npropitiated! O Vinayaka! I praise thee! O elephant-faced, who didst formerly\nprotect the gods, and accomplish their wishes, I praise thee!" Thus,\'\ncontinued P\xc4\x81rvati, shalt thou be praised and worshipped.\' And whoever\npreviously invokes the god Vinayaka, no difficulties shall impede the\nattainment of his purposed\n\np. 331\n\nobject, and a most beneficial result shall he derive from sacrifices,\npilgrimages, and all other devotional acts."\n\nThe following extract from the "Ganapati Upanishad" * is a specimen of the\naddresses to Ganesa used by the Ganapatyas: \xe2\x80\xa0 "Praise to thee, O Ganesa! Thou\nart manifestly the truth; thou art undoubtedly the Creator, Preserver, and\nDestroyer, the Supreme Brahma, the eternal Spirit. I speak what is right and\ntrue; preserve me therefore, when speaking, listening, giving, possessing,\nteaching, learning; continually protect me everywhere. By thee was this\nuniverse manifested; for thou art earth, water, fire, air and ether. Thou art\nBrahm\xc4\x81, Vishnu, and Rudra. We acknowledge thy divinity, O Ekadanta! and\nmeditate on thy countenance; enlighten, therefore, our understanding. He who\ncontinually meditates upon thy divine form, conceiving it to be with one\ntooth, four hands, bearing a rat on thy banner, of a red hue, with a large\nbelly, anointed with red perfumes, arrayed in red garments, worshipped with\nofferings of red flowers, abounding in compassion, the cause of this universe,\nimperishable, unproduced and unaffected by creation, becomes the most\nexcellent of Yogis. Praise, therefore, be to thee, O Ganapati. Whoever\nmeditates upon this figure of the \'Atharva Siras\' (the name of the Upanishad\nof which the Ganapati forms a part) never will be impeded by difficulties,\nwill be liberated from the five great sins, and all lesser ones; and will\nacquire riches, the objects of his desires, virtue and final beatitude."\n\nGanesa is said to have written the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata at Vy\xc4\x81sa\'s dictation. In the\n\xc4\x80diparva of that book it is declared that when the sage was about to compose\nit\n\np. 332\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahm\xc4\x81 advised him to ask Ganesa to become his\namanuensis. Vy\xc4\x81sa at first gave a few difficult sentences to puzzle him, which\nto this day the composer only and his disciple Suka have been able to\nunderstand. As Ganesa paused to think out the meaning of what he was writing,\nVy\xc4\x81sa composed other difficult passages.\n\nIn recent times there has been a supposed incarnation of Ganesa, whose\ndescendant and representative was visited by Captain E. Moor during the\npresent century. The following is the account of his visit: *--"Muraba Goseyn\nwas a Br\xc4\x81hman of Poona who by abstinence, mortification, and prayer, merited\nabove others the favourable regards of the Almighty. Ganapati accordingly\nvouchsafed to appear to him at Chinchoor in a vision by night; desired him to\narise and bathe; and, whilst in the act of ablution, to seize and hold sacred\nto the Godhead the first tangible substance that his hand encountered. The god\ncovenanted that a portion of his Holy Spirit should pervade the person thus\nfavoured, and he continued as far as the seventh generation to his seed, who\nwere to become successively hereditary guardians of this sacred substance,\nwhich proved to be a stone, in which the god was understood as mystically\ntypified. This type is duly reverenced, carefully preserved, and has ever been\nthe constant companion of the sanctified person inheriting with it the divine\npatrimony. This annunciation happened about A.D. 1640; and at the time Captain\nMoor visited the place, the sixth descendant was the representative of the\nDeity.\n\n"It does not now appear what was the precise extent of the divine energy\noriginally conceded, but it is inferred to have been a limited power of\nworking miracles, such as healing sickness, answering the prayers\n\np. 333\n\nof pious suppliants, and the faculty of foretelling future events. These gifts\nwere enjoyed in a more extensive degree by the earlier representatives of the\ngod; but the person whom Moor saw professed to have performed several\nmiracles. The third in descent is reported to have performed a wonderful work.\nIt was in his time that the Moghul army of Hyderabad so successfully invaded\nthe Mahratta country. After plundering and burning Poona, a party proceeded to\nChinchoor, the residence of this Deity, to lay it under contribution. To this\nthe Deo refused to submit, confiding in the divine influence wherewith he was\ninvested. The Mussulmans derided such superstition, and with a view of\nrendering it ridiculous offered to send a Nuzur (present) to the Deo. The\noffer was accepted, the Deo betook himself to prayers, and the insulting\nbigots deputed certain persons to see the result, as apparently a decorous and\nappropriate present was given. It consisted, however, of cow\'s flesh, an\nabomination in the eyes of a Hindu. When the trays were uncovered, they were\ngreatly astonished to find that, instead of the cow\'s flesh, the trays were\nfilled with the finest and most sacred flowers of the Hindus. The Mussulmans,\nseeing this, recognized the finger of God in the transaction, and so struck\nwere they with the reality of the miracle that a valuable grant of land was\nmade to the Deo, which his temple enjoys to this day."\n\nThe Deo eats, sleeps, marries, and lives the life of an ordinary mortal; and\nthough he is regarded as a fool in worldly matters, he is worshipped as a god.\nOn special occasions his actions and movements are most carefully watched, as\nthey are transient manifestations of the divine will, and are regarded as\nprophetic. Thus, on a particular night of the year, should he remain in\n\np. 334\n\npeaceful sleep, national repose is predicted; should his slumbers or his\nwaking moments be disturbed, national calamities are expected. If he start\nwildly from his seat, seize a sword, or make any warlike movement, war may be\nlooked for."\n\n##### 2\\. KARTIKEYA.\n\nKartikeya, the god of war, and generalissimo of the armies of the gods, though\ncalled the younger son of\n\n[![KARTIKEYA.](tn/33400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/33400.jpg)  \nKARTIKEYA.  \n\n[paragraph continues] Siva and Parvati, according to most of the Puranic\nlegends, is their son only in the sense that they formed\n\np. 335\n\nhim. Brahm\xc4\x81 arranged for his birth in answer to the prayers of the gods for a\ncompetent leader of their forces. The R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana * says: "While Siva, the lord\nof the gods, was performing austerities, the other deities went to Brahm\xc4\x81 and\nasked for a general in the room of Mah\xc4\x81deva, who, it seems, had formerly acted\nin that capacity. \'He,\' said they, \'whom thou didst formerly give as a leader\nof our armies (Mah\xc4\x81deva), is now performing great austerities, along with\nUm\xc4\x81.\' Brahm\xc4\x81 says that in consequence of the curse of Um\xc4\x81 no son could be born\nof any wives of the gods, but that Agni should have a son by the river Gang\xc4\x81,\nwho should be their general."\n\nIn the following extract from the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata \xe2\x80\xa0 is an explanation of the\nstatement in the preceding paragraph that Agni was to be the father of this\ngod. Kartikeya has just been installed as general, when, "the god whose banner\nis a bull (Siva), arriving with his goddess, paid him honour, well pleased.\nBr\xc4\x81hmans called Agni Rudra, consequently he (Kartikeya) is the son of Rudra.\nHaving seen him thus honoured by Rudra, all the deities consequently call him,\nwho is the most excellent of the gifted, the son of Rudra. For this child was\nproduced by Rudra when he entered into fire. Skanda (Kartikeya), that most\neminent deity, being born of Agni, [who was] Rudra, and from Sv\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81 (Um\xc4\x81) [and]\nthe six wives [of the Rishis], was the son of Rudra."\n\nThis quotation will be more intelligible after reading what precedes it:\n"Indra being distressed at the defeat of the armies of the gods by the\nD\xc4\x81navas, is meditating on this subject, when he hears the cry of a female\ncalling for help, and asking for a husband to protect her. Indra sees that she\nhas been seized by the demon Kesin, with\n\np. 336\n\nwhom he remonstrates; but the demon hurls his club at Indra, who, however,\nsplits it with his thunderbolt. Kesin is disabled in the next stage of the\ncombat, and goes off. Indra then finds out from the female that her name is\nDevasen\xc4\x81 (army of the gods), that she has a sister named Daityasen\xc4\x81 (army of\nthe daityas), and that they are both daughters of Praj\xc4\x81pati. She wishes Indra\nto find her a proper husband, who shall be able to overcome the enemies of the\ngods. Indra takes Devasen\xc4\x81 with him to Brahm\xc4\x81, and desires him to provide her\nwith a martial husband; and Brahm\xc4\x81 promises that a helpmate of that\ndescription shall be born. It happened that Vasishtha and other Rishis had\nbeen offering a sacrifice, whither the gods, headed by Indra, proceeded to\ndrink the Soma juice. Agni, too, being invoked, descended from the region of\nthe sun, entered into the fire, received the oblations of the Rishis, and\npresented them to the gods.\n\n"Issuing forth [from the fire], he beheld the wives of these great [Rishis]\nreclining in their own hermitages, and sweetly sleeping, resembling golden\naltars, pure as beams of the moon, like to flames of fire, all wonderful as\nstars. Perceiving that his senses became agitated, beholding the wives of the\nRishis, Agni was overcome with desire. Again and again he said, \'It is not\nproper that I should be thus agitated; they are not in love with me. Entering\ninto the domestic fire, I shall gaze upon them close at hand.\' Entering the\ndomestic fire, touching, as it were, with his flames, all of them, and\nbeholding them, he was delighted. Dwelling thus there for a long time, fixing\nhis attention on these beautiful women, and enamoured of them, Agni was\novercome.\n\n"Agni failing to obtain the Br\xc4\x81hmans\' wives, resolved to abandon his corporeal\nform, and went into the forest.\n\np. 337\n\n[paragraph continues] Then Sv\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81, the daughter of Daksha, first fell in love\nwith him. This amorous and blameless goddess for a long time sought for his\nweak point, but could not find any. But being aware that he had gone into the\nwood, and that he was really disturbed by desire, the amorous goddess thus\nreflected: \'I, who am distressed with love, will take the forms of the seven\nRishis\' wives, and will court the affection of Agni. By doing so he will be\npleased, and I shall obtain my desire.\' Assuming first the form of Siva, the\nwife of Angiras, the handsome goddess went to Agni, and thus addressed him:\n\'Agni, thou oughtest to love me, who am disturbed with love for thee; if thou\nwilt not do so, look upon me as dead. Agni, I, Siva, the wife of Angiras, have\ncome, sent by virtuous women.\' Agni replied: \'How dost thou, and how do the\nother beloved wives of the seven Rishis, know that I am distressed with\nlove?\'"\n\nAgni was not able to resist the temptation. After the interview, lest the\nwives of the Rishis should be blamed for their misconduct if she happened to\nbe seen in their form, she assumed the figure of Garuda, the bird of Vishnu,\nand unnoticed, as she thought, flew from the forest. She visited Agni a second\ntime, as the wife of another Rishi, and so on until she had paid six visits.\nThe germs obtained from Agni she deposited in a golden reservoir, which,\n"being worshipped by the Rishis, generated a son. Kum\xc4\x81ra (Kartikeya) was born\nwith six heads, a double number of ears, twelve eyes, arms, and feet, one neck\nand one belly.\n\n"Kartikeya marries Devasen\xc4\x81. The six Rishis\' wives, his mothers, afterwards\ncome to him, complaining that they had been abandoned by their husbands, and\ndegraded from their former positions, and asking him to secure their admission\ninto paradise (Swarga). When\n\np. 338\n\n[paragraph continues] Skanda had done what was gratifying to his mothers,\nSv\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81 said to him, \'Thou art my genuine son. I desire the love difficult to\nobtain which thou givest.\' Skanda then asked her, \'What love dost thou\ndesire?\' Sv\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81 replied, \'I am the beloved daughter of Daksha, by name Sv\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81.\nFrom my childhood I have been enamoured of Agni; but, my son, Agni does not\nthoroughly know me, who am enamoured of him.\' Skanda replied, \'Whatever\noblation of Br\xc4\x81hmans is introduced by hymns, they shall always, goddess, lift\nand throw it into the fire, saying Sv\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81 (happiness). Thus, O beautiful\ngoddess, Agni shall dwell with thee continually." Then Brahm\xc4\x81 Praj\xc4\x81pati said\nto Skanda, Go to thy _father Mah \xc4\x81deva_, the vexer of Tripura. Thou,\nunconquered, hast been produced for the good of all worlds by Rudra, who had\nentered into Agni, and Um\xc4\x81, who had entered into Sv\xc4\x81h\xc4\x81.\'"\n\nThe allusion to Rudra\'s entering into Agni is explained in the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana. The\ngods, fearing that the descendants of such a pair as Siva and P\xc4\x81rvati would be\ntoo dreadful to live with, entreated those deities not to have offspring. Siva\nconsented, but Um\xc4\x81, being angry, declared that as she could not have children\nthe other goddesses should suffer similar deprivation. Unfortunately, the gods\ncame too late to prevent the production of Kartikeya; the germ from which he\nwas born having been received by the earth. Agni and V\xc4\x81yu entered it, and\ndeposited it with Gang\xc4\x81, the sister of Um\xc4\x81, and thus this deity was produced.\n\nThe "Siva Pur\xc4\x81na" * gives a different account of his origin, and teaches that\nhe was produced to effect the destruction of T\xc4\x81rika. This demon, who was King\nof Tripura, was " exceedingly ambitious and oppressive.\n\np. 339\n\nHe forced Brahm\xc4\x81, by his penance and austerities, to promise him any boon that\nhe should demand. Among his austerities he went through the following series,\neach of the eleven specific mortifications continuing 100 years:--1\\. He stood\non one foot, holding the other and both hands up towards heaven, with his eyes\nfixed on the sun. 2. He stood on one great toe. 3. He took only water as\nsustenance. 4. He lived similarly on air. 5. He remained in water. 6. He was\nburied in the earth, but continued as under the last infliction, in incessant\nadoration. 7. The same in fire. 8. He stood on his head. 9. He hung on a tree\nby his hands. 10. He bore the weight of his body on one hand. 11. He hung on a\ntree with his head downwards. *\n\n"Such merit was irresistible, and Indra and a host of demi-gods, alarmed lest\ntheir sovereignty should be usurped through the potency of this penance,\nresorted to Brahm\xc4\x81 for consolation. Brahm\xc4\x81, however, said that, although he\ncould not resist such austerities, he would, after rewarding them by granting\nthe boon demanded, devise a method of rendering it ultimately inoffensive to\nthem.\n\n"The demand by T\xc4\x81rika was that he should be unrivalled in strength, and that\nno hand should slay him but that of a son of Mah\xc4\x81deva. He now became so\narrogant that Indra was forced to yield to him the white eight-headed horse\nUkhisrava; Kuvera gave up his thousand sea-horses; the Rishis were compelled\nto resign the cow K\xc4\x81mdhenu, that yielded everything that could be wished. The\nSun in dread gave no heat, and the Moon in terror remained always at full. The\nWinds\n\np. 340\n\nblew as he dictated, and, in short, he usurped the entire management of the\nuniverse.\n\n"N\xc4\x81rada prophesied the marriage whence should arise the deliverer of the\nworld; but at first Mah\xc4\x81deva could not be influenced with the passion of love.\nIndra persuaded Kama to lie in ambush, and contrived that P\xc4\x81rvati should be\nseen by Siva while engaged in the amiable and graceful act of gathering\nflowers, wherewith to decorate his image. K\xc4\x81ma, accompanied by his wife Rati\n(Desire), and his bosom friend Vasantu (the Spring), took his aim, and\nlaunched an arrow at Mah\xc4\x81deva, who, enraged at the attempt (to interrupt his\ndevotion), reduced K\xc4\x81ma to ashes by a beam of fire that issued from his third\neye. At length, however, by ardent devotion and austerities, P\xc4\x81rvati\npropitiated Siva, and the deity consented to espouse his persevering devotee."\n\nFor some time after their marriage, as there was no child born to them, the\ndistressed and disappointed deities who had been anxiously expecting a\ndeliverer, renewed their lamentations and complaints.\n\n"Agni arrived in the presence of Mah\xc4\x81deva, having been deputed to express the\ndesires of the other gods, that he would provide them with a son, who should\ndestroy T\xc4\x81rika. Siva had just left his wife, and Agni, assuming the form of a\ndove, received from Mah\xc4\x81deva the germ from which Kartikeya arose. Unable to\ncarry it further, he let it fall into the Ganges, on the banks of which river\narose a boy, beautiful as the moon, and bright as the sun, who was called\nAgnibhuva (produced from Agni), Skanda, Kartikeya, etc.\n\n"It happened that six daughters (the Pleiades) of as many Rajas, coming to\nbathe, saw the boy, and each called him her son; and, offering the breast, the\nchild assumed to himself six mouths, and received nurture\n\np. 341\n\nfrom each; whence he is called Sasthim\xc4\x81triya (having six mothers). But in fact\nthe child had no mother, for he came from his father alone. In course of time\na conflict ensued between Kartikeya and T\xc4\x81rika, in which the demon was slain."\n\nA story is told showing how Kartikeya was outwitted by his brother Ganesa. As\nthe two brothers fell in love with two ladies named Siddhi and Buddhi, it was\nagreed that whoever first travelled round the world should have them. Ganesa\nproved by his logical talents and aptness at quotation that he had done this,\nand obtained the prize long before his brother returned from his weary\npilgrimage, to the disquiet of both families when Ganesa\'s sophistry was\ndiscovered.\n\nWe have still another account * of the origin of Kartikeya: "Siva emitted\nsparks of fire from his eyes, which, being thrown into the lake Saravana,\nbecame six infants, who were nursed by the wives of the Rishis, who are seen\nin the sky as the Pleiades. When P\xc4\x81rvati saw these children, she was\ntransported with their beauty, and embraced all of them together so forcibly\nthat their six bodies became one; while their six heads and twelve arms\nremained."\n\nKartikeya is better known in South India under the name of Subramanya. The\n"Skanda Pur\xc4\x81na" gives a full account of his war with Sura, and relates how he\nwas sent by his father to interrupt Daksha\'s sacrifice; and how, at the\ninstigation of the latter, he was delayed on his journey by beautiful damsels,\nwho entertained him with dance and song. Hence it is the practice for dancing\ngirls, who are attached to the pagodas, to be betrothed and married to him;\nand, though allowed to prostitute themselves, cannot marry any one.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[323:*](hmvp35.htm#fr_284) "Asiatic Researches," i. 227.\n\n[324:*](hmvp35.htm#fr_285) Moor\'s "Hindu Pantheon," p. 169.\n\n[325:*](hmvp35.htm#fr_286) Wilson\'s Works, iii.\n\n[327:*](hmvp35.htm#fr_287) Kennedy, "Hindu Mythology," p. 353.\n\n[328:*](hmvp35.htm#fr_288) Kennedy, "Hindu Mythology," p. 353.\n\n[329:*](hmvp35.htm#fr_289) Kennedy, "Hindu Mythology," p. 354.\n\n[331:*](hmvp35.htm#fr_290) Kennedy, "Hindu Mythology," p. 493.\n\n[331:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp35.htm#fr_291) Hindus of whom Ganesa is the supreme object of\nworship.\n\n[332:*](hmvp35.htm#fr_292) "Asiatic Researches," vii. 381.\n\n[335:*](hmvp35.htm#fr_293) Muir, O.
