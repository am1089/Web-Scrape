(The recitation of the Veda shall be interrupted for a day and evening if\nhe has eaten), on beginning a fresh Ka _n_ _d_ a (of his Veda), food given by\na motherless person, 1\n\n2\\. And also if he has eaten, on the day of the completion of a Ka _n_ _d_ a,\nfood given by a fatherless person.\n\n3\\. Some declare, that (the recitation shall be interrupted for the same space\nof time), if he has eaten at a sacrifice offered in honour of gods who were\nformerly men. 3\n\n4\\. Nor is the recitation interrupted, if he has eaten rice received the day\nbefore, or raw meat (though these things may have been offered in honour of\nthe dead), 4\n\n5\\. Nor (if he has eaten at a funeral dinner) roots or fruits of herbs and\ntrees.\n\n6\\. When he performs the ceremony for beginning of a Ka _n_ _d_ a, or when he\nstudies the index of the Anuvakas 6\n\np. 41\n\nof a (Ka _n_ _d_ a), he shall not study that (Ka _n_ _d_ a) on that day (nor\nin that night).\n\n7\\. And if he performs the ceremonies prescribed on beginning or ending the\nrecitation of one entire Veda, he shall not study that Veda (during that day).\n7\n\n8\\. If the wind roars, or if it whirls up the grass on the ground, or if it\ndrives the rain-drops forward during a rain-shower, (then the recitation shall\nbe interrupted for so long a time as the storm lasts). 8\n\n9\\. (Nor shall he study) on the boundary between a village and forest,\n\n10\\. Nor on a highway.\n\n11\\. If (some of his) fellow-students are on a journey, he shall not study\nduring that day, (the passage) which they learn together. 11\n\n12\\. And whilst performing acts for his pleasure,\n\n13\\. Such as washing his feet, shampooing or anointing himself,\n\n14\\. He shall neither study nor teach, as long as he is thus occupied.\n\np. 42\n\n15\\.

Nor in the day-time with shut doors.\n\n20\\. During the spring festival and the festival (of Indra), in the month of\n\xc3\x82sha _dh_ a (June-July), the study of an Anuvaka is forbidden. 20\n\n21\\. (The recitation) of the daily portion of the Veda (at the Brahmaya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a is likewise forbidden if done) in a manner differing from the rule (of\nthe Veda). 21\n\n22\\. (Now follows) the rule (for the daily recitation) of that (Brahmaya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a).\n\n23\\. Before taking his morning-meal, he shall go to the water-side, and having\npurified himself, he shall recite aloud (a portion of the Veda) in a pure 23\n\np. 43\n\nplace, leaving out according to (the order of the) texts (what he has read the\nday before).\n\n24\\. If a stoppage of study is enjoined (for the day, he shall recite the\ndaily portion) mentally.\n\n25\\. If lightning flashes without interruption, or, thunder rolls continually,\nif a man has neglected to purify himself, if he has partaken of a meal in\nhonour of a dead person, or if hoarfrost lies on the ground, (in these cases)\nthey forbid the mental recitation (of the daily portion of the Veda). 25\n\n26\\. Some forbid it only in case one has eaten a funeral dinner. 26\n\n27\\. Where lightning, thunder, and rain happen together out of season, the\nrecitation shall be interrupted for three days. 27\n\n28\\. Some (declare, that the recitation shall stop) until the ground is dry.\n\n29\\. If one or two (of the phenomena mentioned in Sutra 27 appear, the\nrecitation shall be interrupted) from that hour until the same hour next day.\n\n30\\. In the case of an eclipse of the sun or of the moon, of an earthquake, of\na whirlwind, of the fall of a meteor, or of a fire (in the village), at\nwhatever time these events happen, the recitation of all the sacred sciences\n(Vedas and A\xe1\xb9\x85gas) must be interrupted from that hour until the same hour next\nday. 30\n\n31\\. If a cloud appears out of season, if the sun or the moon is surrounded by\na halo, if a rainbow, a parhelion or a comet appears, if a (high) wind\n(blows), 31\n\np. 44\n\na foul smell (is observed), or hoarfrost (lies on the ground, at all these\noccasions (the recitation of all the sacred sciences must be interrupted)\nduring the duration (of these phenomena).\n\n32\\. After the wind has ceased, (the interruption of the recitation continues)\nfor one muhurta. 32\n\n33\\. If (the howl of) a wolf or of a solitary jackal (has been heard, he shall\nstop the reading) until he has slept.\n\n34\\. At night (he shall not study) in a wood, where there is no fire nor gold.\n\n35\\. Out of term he shall not study any part of the Veda which he has not\nlearnt before.\n\n36\\. Nor (shall he study during term some new part of the Veda) in the\nevening. 36\n\n37\\. That which has been studied before, must never be studied (during the\nvacation or in the evening). 37\n\n38\\. Further particulars (regarding the interruption 38\n\np. 45\n\nof the Veda-study may be learnt) from the (teaching and works of other) Vedic\nschools.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[40:1](sbe0214.htm#fr_281) **11**. The Black Ya _g_ ur-veda, to which\n\xc3\x82pastamba belongs, is divided throughout into books called Ka _n_ _d_ as.\n\n[40:3](sbe0214.htm#fr_282) Haradatta names as such gods, Nandisvara and\nKubera. Other commentators, however, explain Manushyaprakriti by\nManushyamukha, 'possessing human faces.' A similar rule occurs Gautama XVI,\n34, Where a Manushyayag\xc3\xb1a is mentioned as a cause for discontinuing the\nrecitation of the Veda. In his Commentary on Gautama, also, Haradatta is in\ndoubt. He first refers the term to the sacraments like the Simantonnayana, and\nthen adds, that some explain it to mean 'a sacrifice to gods who formerly were\nmen.'\n\n[40:4](sbe0214.htm#fr_283) This Sutra is an exception to I, 3, 10, 28.\n\n[40:6](sbe0214.htm#fr_284) Haradatta's commentary on this Sutra is very\nmeagre, and he leaves the word anuvakyam unexplained. I am not ccrtain that my\nexplanation is correct. But it is countenanced by the statements of the G _ri_\nhya-sutras regarding the order of studying. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 132.\n\n[41:7](sbe0214.htm#fr_285) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 145. This Sutra is a _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ apaka\nor 'such a one which indicates the existence of a rule not expressly\nmentioned! Above (I, 3, 9, 1) the yearly -performance of the Upakarma and\nUtsarga ceremonies for the beginning and end of the Brahmanic term has been\nprescribed. In this Sutra the performance of the Upakarma and Utsarga at the\nbeginning and completion of the Parayana or the vow to go through a whole Veda\nis incidentally mentioned. Thence it may be inferred that these ceremonies\nmust. be likewise performed on the latter occasions, though no absolute rule\nto this effect has been given. Such _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ apakas are of frequent occurrence\nin all Sutras, and constitute one of the chief difficulties of their\ninterpretation.\n\n[41:8](sbe0214.htm#fr_286) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 149; Manu IV, 102, 122.\n\n[41:11](sbe0214.htm#fr_287) Others explain the Sutra thus: 'If he meets\nfellow-students, after they have come home from a journey, he shall not study\nwith them on that day.'\n\n[42:15](sbe0214.htm#fr_288) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 145; Manu IV, 113.\n\n[42:16](sbe0214.htm#fr_289) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 51; Manu IV, 120.\n\n[42:20](sbe0214.htm#fr_290) According to Haradatta, \xc3\x82pastamba uses the word\nAnuvaka in order to indicate that smaller portions of the Veda may be studied.\nOthers think, that by Anuvaka, the Sa _m_ hita and the Brahma _n_ a are meant,\nand that the study of the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas is permitted. The Vasantotsava, or spring\nfestival, which, according to the Dramas, was, in olden times, kept all over\nIndia, falls, according to Haradatta, on the thirteenth of the first half of\n_K_ aitra, about the beginning of April.\n\n[42:21](sbe0214.htm#fr_291) 'Hence, if one has forgotten it and eaten one's\nbreakfast, a penance, not the Brahmaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, must be performed'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[42:23](sbe0214.htm#fr_292) See Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka II, 11, 1 and 11; \xc3\x82\n_s_ v. G _ri_. Su. III, 2, 1-2. In our days this rule is usually not observed.\nBrahma _n_ as mostly recite at the daily Brahmaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, 'Veda-offering,'\none particular formula, which symbolically comprises the whole Veda. A few\nlearned Brahma _n_ a friends, however, have assured me, that they still recite\nthe whole of their _S_ akha every year according to this rule of \xc3\x82pastamba.\n\n[43:25](sbe0214.htm#fr_293) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 149; Manu IV, 106, 120, 127; Taitt.\n\xc3\x82r. II, 15, 1.\n\n[43:26](sbe0214.htm#fr_294) Manu IV, 109, 116.\n\n[43:27](sbe0214.htm#fr_295) Manu IV, 103 and 104.\n\n[43:30](sbe0214.htm#fr_296) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 145; Manu IV, 105, 118.\n\n[43:31](sbe0214.htm#fr_297) Manu IV, 104, and see above.\n\n[44:32](sbe0214.htm#fr_298) One muhurta = 48 minutes.\n\n[44:36](sbe0214.htm#fr_299) Other commentators interpret the Sutra in a\ndifferent sense. They take it to mean: 'And (luring the night (from the\ntwelfth to the thirteenth of each half of the month, he shall not study at\nall, be it in or out of term).'\n\n[44:37](sbe0214.htm#fr_300) 'What has been studied before, must not be studied\n(again) at any time in the vacation nor in the evening.'-- Haradatta.\n\n[44:38](sbe0214.htm#fr_301) Haradatta thinks that by 'Parishad,' Manu's and\nother Dharma- _s_ astras are meant. This explanation is, however, not exact.\nParishad, 'assemblage,' means, in the language of the _S_ astras, either a Pa\n_\xc3\xb1_ _k_ , an assemblage of learned Brahmans called together to decide some\nknotty point of law, or a Brahminical school, which studies a particular\nredaction of the Veda (see the Petersburg Dict. s. v.) The latter meaning is\nthat applicable to this Sutra. By 'Parishada _h_ ' are here intended the Vedic\nschools, and their writings and teaching. Gautama also says, XVI, 40.\nPratividya _m_ yan smaranti smaranti, '(he shall observe the stoppages of the\nVeda-study) which they teach in (the writings belonging to) each of the\nVedas.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 4, Kha _n_ _d_ a 12](sbe0215.htm)\n\n"
