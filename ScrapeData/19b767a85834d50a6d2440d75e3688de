XII.\n\nDescription of the moon: his chariot, horses, and course: fed by the sun:\ndrained periodically of ambrosia by the progenitors and gods. The chariots and\nhorses of the planets: kept in their orbits by aerial chains attached to\nDhruva. Typical members of the planetary porpoise. Vasudeva alone real.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--The chariot of the moon has three wheels, and is drawn by ten\nhorses, of the whiteness of the Jasmine, five on the right half (of the yoke),\nfive on the left. It moves along the asterisms, divided into ranges, as before\ndescribed; and, in like manner as the sun, is upheld by Dhruva; the cords that\nfasten it being tightened or relaxed in the same way, as it proceeds on its\ncourse. The horses of the moon, sprung from the bosom of the waters 1, drag\nthe car for a whole Kalpa, as do the coursers of the sun. The radiant sun\nsupplies the moon, when reduced by the draughts of the gods to a single Kala,\nwith a single ray; and in the same proportion as the ruler of the night was\nexhausted by the celestials, it is replenished by the sun, the plunderer of\nthe waters: for the gods, Maitreya, drink the nectar and ambrosia accumulated\nin the moon during half the month, and from this being their food they are\nimmortal. Thirty-six thousand three hundred and thirty-three divinities drink\nthe lunar ambrosia. When two digits remain, the moon enters the orbit of the\nsun, and abides in the ray called Ama; whence the period is termed Amavasya.\nIn that orbit the moon is immersed for a day and night in the water; thence it\nenters the branches and shoots of the trees; and thence goes to the sun.\nConsequently any one who cuts off a branch, or casts down a leaf, when the\nmoon is in the trees (the day of its rising invisible), is guilty of\nBrahmanicide. When the remaining portion of the moon consists of but a\nfifteenth part, the progenitors approach it in the afternoon, and drink the\nlast portion, that sacred Kali which is composed of ambrosia, and contained in\nthe two digits of\n\np. 239\n\nthe form of the moon 2. Having drank the nectar effused by the lunar rays on\nthe day of conjunction, the progenitors are satisfied, and remain tranquil for\nthe ensuing month. These progenitors (or Pitris) are of three classes, termed\nSaumyas, Varhishadas, and Agnishwattas 3. In this manner the moon, with its\ncooling rays, nourishes the gods in the light fortnight, the Pitris in the\ndark fortnight; vegetables, with the cool nectary aqueous atoms it sheds upon\nthem; and through their developement it sustains men, animals, and insects; at\nthe same time gratifying them by its radiance.\n\nThe chariot of the son of Chandra, Budha or Mercury, is composed of the\nelementary substances air and fire, and is drawn by eight bay horses of the\nspeed of the wind. The vast car of \xc5\x9aukra (Venus) is drawn by earth-born horses\n4, is equipped with a protecting fender and a floor, armed with arrows, and\ndecorated by a banner. The splendid car of\n\np. 240\n\n[paragraph continues] Bhauma (Mars) is of gold, of an octagonal shape, drawn\nby eight horses, of a ruby red, sprung from fire. Vrihaspati (Jupiter), in a\ngolden car drawn by eight pale-coloured horses, travels from sign to sign in\nthe period of a year: and the tardy-paced \xc5\x9aani (Saturn) moves slowly along in\na car drawn by piebald steeds. Eight black horses draw the dusky chariot of\nRahu, and once harnessed are attached to it for ever. On the Parvas (the\nnodes, or lunar and solar eclipses), Rahu directs his course from the sun to\nthe moon, and back again from the moon to the sun 5. The eight horses of the\nchariot of Ketu are of the dusky red colour of Lac, or of the smoke of burning\nstraw.\n\nI have thus described to you, Maitreya, the chariots of the nine planets, all\nwhich are fastened to Dhruva by aerial cords. The orbs of all the planets,\nasterisms, and stars are attached to Dhruva, and travel accordingly in their\nproper orbits, being kept in their places by their respective bands of air. As\nmany as are the stars, so many are the chains of air that secure them to\nDhruva; and as they turn round, they cause the pole-star also to revolve. In\nthe same manner as the oil-man himself, going round, causes the spindle to\nrevolve, so the planets travel round, suspended by cords of air, which are\ncircling round a (whirling) centre. The air, which is called Pravaha, is so\ntermed because it bears along the planets, which turn round, like a disc of\nfire, driven by the aerial wheel 6.\n\nThe celestial porpoise, in which Dhruva is fixed, has been mentioned, but you\nshall hear its constituent parts in more detail, as it is of great efficacy;\nfor the view of it at night expiates whatever sin has been committed during\nthe day; and those who behold it live as many years as there are stars in it,\nin the sky, or even more. Uttanapada is to be considered as its upper jaw;\nSacrifice as its lower. Dharma is situated on its brow; Narayan\xcc\x81a in its\nheart. The \xc3\x81swins are its two fore feet;\n\np. 241\n\nand Varun\xcc\x81a and \xc3\x81ryamat its two hinder legs. Samvatsara is its sexual organ;\nMitra its organ of excretion. Agni, Mahendra, Ka\xc5\x9byapa, and Dhruva, in\nsuccession, are placed in its tail; which four stars in this constellation\nnever set 7.\n\nI have now described to you the disposition of the earth and of the stars; of\nthe insular zones, with their oceans and mountains, their Varshas or regions,\nand their inhabitants: their nature has also been explained, but it may be\nbriefly recapitulated.\n\nFrom the waters, which are the body of Vishn\xcc\x81u, was produced the lotus-shaped\nearth, with its seas and mountains. The stars are Vishn\xcc\x81u; the worlds are\nVishn\xcc\x81u; forests, mountains, regions, rivers, oceans are Vishn\xcc\x81u: he is all\nthat is, all that is not. He, the lord, is identical with knowledge, through\nwhich he is all forms, but is not a substance. You must conceive therefore\nmountains, oceans, and all the diversities of earth and the rest, are the\nillusions of the apprehension. When knowledge is pure, real, universal,\nindependent of works, and exempt from defect, then the varieties of substance,\nwhich are the fruit of the tree of desire, cease to exist in matter. For what\nis substance? Where is the thing that is devoid of beginning, middle, and end,\nof one uniform\n\np. 242\n\nnature? How can reality be predicated of that which is subject to change, and\nreassumes no more its original character? Earth is fabricated into a jar; the\njar is divided into two halves; the halves are broken to pieces; the pieces\nbecome dust; the dust becomes atoms. Say, is this reality? though it be so\nunderstood by man, whose self-knowledge is impeded by his own acts. Hence,\nBrahman, except discriminative knowledge, there is nothing any where, or at\nany time, that is real. Such knowledge is but one, although it appear\nmanifold, as diversified by the various consequences of our own acts.\nKnowledge perfect, pure, free from pain, and detaching the affections from all\nthat causes affliction; knowledge single and eternal--is the supreme Vasudeva,\nbesides whom there is nothing. The truth has been thus communicated to you by\nme; that knowledge which is truth; from which all that differs is false. That\ninformation, however, which is of a temporal and worldly nature has also been\nimparted to you; the sacrifice, the victim, the fire, the priests, the acid\njuice, the gods, the desire for heaven, the path pursued by acts of devotion\nand the rest, and the worlds that are their consequences, have been displayed\nto you. In that universe which I have described, he for ever migrates who is\nsubject to the influence of works; but he who knows Vasudeva to be eternal,\nimmutable, and of one unchanging, universal form, may continue to perform them\n8, as thereby he enters into the deity.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[238:1](vp070.htm#fr_718) So is the car, according to the Vayu. The orb of the\nmoon, according to the Linga, is only congealed water; as that of the sun is\nconcentrated heat.\n\n[239:2](vp070.htm#fr_719) There is some indistinctness in this account, from a\nconfusion between the division of the moon's surface into sixteen Kalas or\nphases, and its [apportionment](errata.htm#9), as a receptacle of nectar, into\nfifteen Kalas or digits, corresponding to the fifteen lunations, on the\nfourteen of which, during the wane, the gods drink the amrita, and on the\nfifteenth of which the Pitris exhaust the remaining portion. The\ncorrespondence of the two distinctions appears to be intended by the text,\nwhich terms the remaining digit or Kala, composed of Amrita, the form or\nsuperficies of the two Kalas. This, the commentator observes, is the\nfifteenth, not the sixteenth. The commentator on our text observes, also, that\nthe passage is sometimes read ###, Lava meaning 'a moment,' 'a short period.'\nThe Matsya and Vayu express the parallel passage so as to avoid all\nperplexity, by specifying the two Kalas as referring to time, and leaving the\nnumber of nectareous Kalas undefined: 'They, the Pitris, drink the remaining\nKalas in two Kalas of time.' Col. Warren explains Kala, or, as he 'writes it,\nCala, in one of its acceptations, 'the phases of the moon, of which the Hindus\ncount sixteen.' Kala Sankalita, 359. So the Bhagavata terms the moon, and the\nVayu, after noticing the exhaustion of the fifteenth portion on the day of\nconjunction, states the recurrence of increase or wane to take place in the\nsixteenth phase at the beginning of each fortnight.\n\n[239:3](vp070.htm#fr_720) The Vayu and Matsya add a fourth class, the Kavyas;\nidentifying them with the cyclic years; the Saumyas and Agnishwattas with the\nseasons; and the Varhishads with the months.\n\n[239:4](vp070.htm#fr_721) The Vayu makes the horses ten in number, each of a\ndifferent colour.\n\n[240:5](vp070.htm#fr_722) The Matsya, Linga, and Vayu add the circumstance of\nRahu's taking up, on these occasions, the circular shadow of the earth.\n\n[240:6](vp070.htm#fr_723) The different bands of air attached to Dhruva are,\naccording to the commentator, varieties of the Pravaha wind; but the Kurma and\nLinga enumerate seven principal winds which perform this function, of which\nthe Pravaha is one.\n\n[241:7](vp070.htm#fr_724) The four last are therefore stars in the circle of\nperpetual apparition. One of these is the pole-star; and in Ka\xc5\x9byapa we have a\nverbal affinity to Cassiopeia. The \xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bumara, or porpoise, is rather a singular\nsymbol for the celestial sphere; but it is not more preposterous than many of\nthe constellations of classical fiction. The component parts of it are much\nmore fully detailed, in the Bhagavata, whence it has been translated by Sir\nWm. Jones. As. Res. II. 402. The Bhagavata, however, mystifies the\ndescription, and says it is nothing more than the Dharan\xcc\x81a, or symbol, by\nwhich Vishn\xcc\x81u, identified with the starry firmament, is to be impressed upon\nthe mind in meditation. The account of the planetary system is, as usual,\nfullest in the Vayu, with which the Linga and Matsya nearly agree. The\nBhavishya is nearly, also, the same. They all contain many passages common to\nthem and to our text. In the Agni, Padma, Kurma, Brahma, Garud\xcc\x81a, and Vamana\ndescriptions occur which enter into less detail than the Vishn\xcc\x81u, and often\nuse its words, or passages found in other Puran\xcc\x81as. Many intimations of a\nsimilar system occur in the Vedas, but whether the whole is to be found in\nthose works is yet to be ascertained. It must not be considered as a correct\nrepresentation of the philosophical astronomy of the Hindus, being mixed up\nwith, and deformed by, mythological and symbolical fiction.\n\n[242:8](vp070.htm#fr_725) Only, however, as far as they are intended to\npropitiate Vishn\xcc\x81u, and not for any other purpose.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIII](vp071.htm)\n\n"
