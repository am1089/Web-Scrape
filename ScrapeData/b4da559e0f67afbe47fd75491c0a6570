On what perilous adventure\nhad I sent this only son of his mother? O God, why need my expiation have such\npomp and circumstance? Could I not be allowed to suffer alone without inviting\nall this multitude to share my punishment? Oh, let not this innocent child\nfall victim to Your wrath.\n\nI called him back--"Amulya!"\n\nMy voice sounded so feebly, it failed to reach him.\n\nI went up to the door and called again: "Amulya!"\n\nHe had gone.\n\n"Who is there?"\n\n"Rani Mother!"\n\n"Go and tell Amulya Babu that I want him."\n\nWhat exactly happened I could not make out--the man, perhaps, was not familiar\nwith Amulya\'s name--but he returned almost at once followed by Sandip.\n\n"The very moment you sent me away," he said as he came in, "I had a\npresentiment that you would call me back. The attraction of the same moon\ncauses both ebb and flow. I was so sure of being sent for, that I was actually\nwaiting out in the passage. As soon as I caught sight of your man, coming from\nyour room, I said: \'Yes, yes, I am coming, I am coming at once!\'--before he\ncould utter a word. That up-country lout was surprised, I can tell you! He\nstared at me, open-mouthed, as if he thought I knew magic.\n\n"All the fights in the world, Queen Bee," Sandip rambled on, "are really\nfights between hypnotic forces. Spell cast against spell-- noiseless weapons\nwhich reach even invisible targets. At last I have met in you my match. Your\nquiver is full, I know, you artful warrior Queen! You are the only one in the\nworld who has been able to turn Sandip out and call Sandip back, at your sweet\nwill. Well, your quarry is at your feet. What will you do with him now? Will\nyou give him the coup de grace, or keep him in your cage? Let me warn you\nbeforehand, Queen, you will find the beast as difficult to kill outright as to\nkeep in bondage. Anyway, why lose time in trying your magic weapons?"\n\nSandip must have felt the shadow of approaching defeat, and this made him try\nto gain time by chattering away without waiting for a reply. I believe he knew\nthat I had sent the messenger for Amulya, whose name the man must have\nmentioned. In spite of that he had deliberately played this trick. He was now\ntrying to avoid giving me any opening to tell him that it was Amulya I wanted,\nnot him. But his stratagem was futile, for I could see his weakness through\nit. I must not yield up a pin\'s point of the ground I had gained.\n\n"Sandip Babu," I said, "I wonder how you can go on making these endless\nspeeches, without a stop. Do you get them up by heart, beforehand?"\n\nSandip\'s face flushed instantly.\n\n"I have heard," I continued, "that our professional reciters keep a book full\nof all kinds of ready-made discourses, which can be fitted into any subject.\nHave you also a book?"\n\nSandip ground out his reply through his teeth. "God has given you women a\nplentiful supply of coquetry to start with, and on the top of that you have\nthe milliner and the jeweller to help you; but do not think we men are so\nhelpless ..."\n\n"You had better go back and look up your book, Sandip Babu. You are getting\nyour words all wrong. That\'s just the trouble with trying to repeat things by\nrote."\n\n"You!" shouted Sandip, losing all control over himself. "You to insult me\nthus! What is there left of you that I do not know to the very bottom? What\n..." He became speechless.\n\nSandip, the wielder of magic spells, is reduced to utter powerlessness,\nwhenever his spell refuses to work. From a king he fell to the level of a\nboor. Oh, the joy of witnessing his weakness! The harsher he became in his\nrudeness, the more did this joy well up within me. His snaky coils, with which\nhe used to snare me, are exhausted--I am free. I am saved, saved. Be rude to\nme, insult me, for that shows you in your truth; but spare me your songs of\npraise, which were false.\n\nMy husband came in at this juncture. Sandip had not the elasticity to recover\nhimself in a moment, as he used to do before. My husband looked at him for a\nwhile in surprise. Had this happened some days ago I should have felt ashamed.\nBut today I was pleased--whatever my husband might think. I wanted to have it\nout to the finish with my weakening adversary.\n\nFinding us both silent and constrained, my husband hesitated a little, and\nthen took a chair. "Sandip," he said, "I have been looking for you, and was\ntold you were here."\n\n"I am here," said Sandip with some emphasis. "Queen Bee sent for me early this\nmorning. And I, the humble worker of the hive, left all else to attend her\nsummons."\n\n"I am going to Calcutta tomorrow. You will come with me.\n\n"And why, pray? Do you take me for one of your retinue?"\n\n"Oh, very well, take it that you are going to Calcutta, and that I am your\nfollower."\n\n"I have no business there."\n\n"All the more reason for going. You have too much business here."\n\n"I don\'t propose to stir."\n\n"Then I propose to shift you."\n\n"Forcibly?"\n\n"Forcibly."\n\n"Very well, then, I will make a move. But the world is not divided between\nCalcutta and your estates. There are other places on the map."\n\n"From the way you have been going on, one would hardly have thought that there\nwas any other place in the world except my estates."\n\nSandip stood up. "It does happen at times," he said, "that a man\'s whole world\nis reduced to a single spot. I have realized my universe in this sitting-room\nof yours, that is why I have been a fixture here."\n\nThen he turned to me. "None but you, Queen Bee," he said, "will understand my\nwords--perhaps not even you. I salute you. With worship in my heart I leave\nyou. My watchword has changed since you have come across my vision. It is no\nlonger _Bande Mataram_ (Hail Mother), but Hail Beloved, Hail Enchantress. The\nmother protects, the mistress leads to destruction--but sweet is that\ndestruction. You have made the anklet sounds of the dance of death tinkle in\nmy heart. You have changed for me, your devotee, the picture I had of this\nBengal of ours--\'the soft breeze-cooled land of pure water and sweet fruit.\'\n27 You have no pity, my beloved. You have come to me with your poison cup and\nI shall drain it, either to die in agony or live triumphing over death.\n\n"Yes," he continued. "The mother\'s day is past. O love, my love, you have made\nas naught for me the truth and right and heaven itself. All duties have become\nas shadows: all rules and restraints have snapped their bonds. O love, my\nlove, I could set fire to all the world outside this land on which you have\nset your dainty feet, and dance in mad revel over the ashes ... These are mild\nmen. These are good men. They would do good to all--as if this all were a\nreality! No, no! There is no reality in the world save this one real love of\nmine. I do you reverence. My devotion to you has made me cruel; my worship of\nyou has lighted the raging flame of destruction within me. I am not righteous.\nI have no beliefs, I only believe in her whom, above all else in the world, I\nhave been able to realize."\n\nWonderful! It was wonderful, indeed. Only a minute ago I had despised this man\nwith all my heart. But what I had thought to be dead ashes now glowed with\nliving fire. The fire in him is true, that is beyond doubt. Oh why has God\nmade man such a mixed creature? Was it only to show his supernatural sleight\nof hand? Only a few minutes ago I had thought that Sandip, whom I had once\ntaken to be a hero, was only the stage hero of melodrama. But that is not so,\nnot so. Even behind the trappings of the theatre, a true hero may sometimes be\nlurking.\n\nThere is much in Sandip that is coarse, that is sensuous, that is false, much\nthat is overlaid with layer after layer of fleshly covering. Yet--yet it is\nbest to confess that there is a great deal in the depths of him which we do\nnot, cannot understand-- much in ourselves too. A wonderful thing is man. What\ngreat mysterious purpose he is working out only the Terrible One  28 knows--\nmeanwhile we groan under the brunt of it. Shiva is the Lord of Chaos. He is\nall Joy. He will destroy our bonds.\n\nI cannot but feel, again and again, that there are two persons in me. One\nrecoils from Sandip in his terrible aspect of Chaos--the other feels that very\nvision to be sweetly alluring. The sinking ship drags down all who are\nswimming round it. Sandip is just such a force of destruction. His immense\nattraction gets hold of one before fear can come to the rescue, and then, in\nthe twinkiing of an eye, one is drawn away, irresistibly, from all light, all\ngood, all freedom of the sky, all air that can be breathed--from lifelong\naccumulations, from everyday cares--right to the bottom of dissolution.\n\nFrom some realm of calamity has Sandip come as its messenger; and as he stalks\nthe land, muttering unholy incantations, to him flock all the boys and youths.\nThe mother, seated in the lotus-heart of the Country, is wailing her heart\nout; for they have broken open her store-room, there to hold their drunken\nrevelry. Her vintage of the draught for the immortals they would pour out on\nthe dust; her time-honoured vessels they would smash to pieces. True, I feel\nwith her; but, at the same time, I cannot help being infected with their\nexcitement.\n\nTruth itself has sent us this temptation to test our trustiness in upholding\nits commandments. Intoxication masquerades in heavenly garb, and dances before\nthe pilgrims saying: "Fools you are that pursue the fruitless path of\nrenunciation. Its way is long, its time passing slow. So the Wielder of the\nThunderbolt has sent me to you. Behold, I the beautiful, the passionate, I\nwill accept you--in my embrace you shall find fulfilment."\n\nAfter a pause Sandip addressed me again: "Goddess, the time has come for me to\nleave you. It is well. The work of your nearness has been done. By lingering\nlonger it would only become undone again, little by little. All is lost, if in\nour greed we try to cheapen that which is the greatest thing on earth. That\nwhich is eternal within the moment only becomes shallow if spread out in time.\nWe were about to spoil our infinite moment, when it was your uplifted\nthunderbolt which came to the rescue. You intervened to save the purity of\nyour own worship--and in so doing you also saved your worshipper. In my leave-\ntaking today your worship stands out the biggest thing. Goddess, I, also, set\nyou free today. My earthen temple could hold you no longer-- every moment it\nwas on the point of breaking apart. Today I depart to worship your larger\nimage in a larger temple. I can gain you more truly only at a distance from\nyourself. Here I had only your favour, there I shall be vouchsafed your boon."\n\nMy jewel-casket was lying on the table. I held it up aloft as I said: "I\ncharge you to convey these my jewels to the object of my worship--to whom I\nhave dedicated them through you."\n\nMy husband remained silent. Sandip left the room.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[27](hw43.htm#fr_26) Quotation from the National song-- _Bande Mataram_.\n\n[28](hw43.htm#fr_27) Rudra, the Terrible, a name of Shiva.
