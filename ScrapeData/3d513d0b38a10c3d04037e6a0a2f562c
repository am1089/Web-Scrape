To this god Agni I sing [1](sbe46073.htm#an_3:13:1:1) for you most\npowerfully. May he come to us with the gods; may he, the best sacrificer, sit\ndown on the sacrificial grass.\n\n2\\. The righteous one to whose skill the two worlds (Heaven and Earth) and\n(all) blessings cling--Him the men rich in offerings magnify, Him those who\nlong for gain, that they may obtain his blessing.\n\n3\\. He, the priest, is the guide of these (men) [1](sbe46073.htm#an_3:13:3:1),\nand he indeed (is the guide) of sacrifices. Praise ye this Agni who is the\ngiver, the winner of wealth.\n\n4\\. May this Agni give us most blissful shelter for our (sacrificial) feast,\nwhence he may shower wealth on us in heaven, the (human) dwellings\n[1](sbe46073.htm#an_3:13:4:1), and in the waters.\n\n5\\. The singers kindle Agni, the Hot _ri_ , the lord of the tribes, the\nbrilliant, the wonderful, with his excellent thoughts\n[1](sbe46073.htm#an_3:13:5:1).\n\n6\\. And mayst thou, the best invoker of the gods, help us in our spell, in our\nhymns. Shine bliss on us, Agni whom the Maruts strengthen\n[1](sbe46073.htm#an_3:13:6:1), the greatest winner of thousandfold (wealth).\n\n7\\. Now bestow on us thousandfold wealth with offspring and prosperity,\nsplendid, most powerful, and undecaying abundance in heroes, O Agni!\n\np. 267\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is _Ri_ shabha Vai _s_ vamitra. The metre is Anush _t_ ubh.--\nVerses 6, 7 = MS. IV, 11, 2.--Comp. concerning this hymn, Aitareya Brahma _n_\na II, 40.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Ar _k_ a (ar _k_ a) may be first or second person. Comp., for\ninstance, VI, 16, 22. pra va _h_ sakhaya _h_ agnaye stomam \xe2\x80\xa6 ar _k_ a ga\xc2\xb4ya\n_k_ a vedhase; X, 50, 1. pra va _h_ mahe \xe2\x80\xa6 ar _k_ a (Sa _m_ hitap. ar _k_ a)\nvi _s_ va\xc2\xb4naraya vi _s_ vabhuve, and see Benfey, Die\nQuantitatsverschiedenheiten in den Sa _m_ hita-und Pada-Texten der Veden, III,\np. 8.--On the metre of the second Pada, comp. my Prolegomena, p. 188.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. Perhaps we should supply, on account of the preceding nominative,\nvipra _h_ ('priest'): of these (priests).\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Kshitibhya _h_ seems to me to be co-ordinated with divi and apsu a\xc2\xb4;\ncomp. X, 89, 11. The locative kshitishu would not have suited the metre as\nwell as the dative. Prof. Max Muller proposes to translate: 'Whence he may\nshower wealth on our dwelling, whether he be in the sky or in the waters.'\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Comp. X, 172, 2. a\xc2\xb4 yahi vasvya dhiya\xc2\xb4.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Comp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana _S_ rautasutra VIII, 16. indra _h_ marutvan \xe2\x80\xa6\nmarutstotra _h_ marudga _n_ a _h_ marudv _ri_ dha _h_ marutsakha.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 14](sbe46074.htm)\n\n"
