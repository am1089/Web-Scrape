If he has any doubts regarding the caste and conduct of a person who has\ncome to him in order to fulfil his duty (of learning the Veda), he shall\nkindle a fire (with the ceremonies prescribed for kindling the sacrificial\nfire) and ask him about his caste and conduct. 1\n\n2\\. If he declares himself to be (of) good (family and conduct, the teacher\nelect) shall say, 'Agni who sees, Vayu who hears, \xc3\x82ditya who brings to light,\nvouch for his goodness; may it be well with this person! He is free from sin.'\nThen he shall begin to teach him.\n\n3\\. A guest comes to the house resembling a burning fire. 3\n\np. 115\n\n4\\. He is called a _S_ rotriya who, observing the law (of studentship), has\nlearned one recension of the Veda (which may be current in his family). 4\n\n5\\. He is called a guest (who, being a _S_ rotriya), approaches solely for the\nfulfilment of his religious duties, and with no other object, a householder\nwho lives intent on the fulfilment of his duties. 5\n\n6\\. The reward for honouring (such a guest) is immunity from misfortunes, and\nheavenly bliss. 6\n\n7\\. He shall go to meet such (a guest), honour him according to his age (by\nthe formulas of salutation prescribed), and cause a seat to be given to him.\n\n8\\. Some declare that, if possible, the seat should have many feet. 8\n\n9\\. The (householder himself) shall wash the feet of that (guest); according\nto some, two _S_ udras shall do it.\n\n10\\. One of them shall be employed in pouring water (over the guest, the other\nin washing his feet).\n\n11\\. Some declare that the water for the (guest) shall be brought in an\nearthen vessel. 11\n\np. 116\n\n12\\. But (a guest) who has not yet returned home from his teacher shall not be\na cause for fetching water. 12\n\n13\\. In case a (student comes, the host) shall repeat the Veda (together with\nhim) for a longer time (than with other guests).\n\n14\\. He shall converse kindly (with his guest), and gladden him with milk or\nother (drinks), with eatables, or at least with water.\n\n15\\. He shall offer to his guest a room, a bed, a mattress, a pillow with a\ncover, and ointment, and what else (may be necessary). 15\n\n16\\. (If the dinner has been finished before the arrival of the guest), he\nshall call his cook and give him rice or yava for (preparing a fresh meal for)\nthe guest. 16\n\n17\\. (If dinner is ready at the arrival of the guest), he himself shall\nportion out the food and look at it, saying (to himself), 'Is this (portion)\ngreater, or this?'\n\n18\\. He shall say, 'Take out a larger (portion for the guest).'\n\n19\\. A guest who is at enmity (with his host) shall not eat his food, nor\n(shall he eat the food of a host) who hates him or accuses him of a crime, or\nof one who is suspected of a crime. 19\n\n20\\. For it is declared in the Veda that he (who eats the food of such a\nperson) eats his guilt.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[114:1](sbe0241.htm#fr_582) **6**. The person desirous to study addresses his\nteacher elect with the following Mantra: Bhagavan maitre _n_ a _k_ akshusha pa\n_s_ ya _s_ ivena manasanug _ri_ ha _n_ a prasida mam adhyapaya, 'venerable\nSir, look on me with a friendly eye, receive me with a favourable mind, be\nkind and teach me.' The teacher elect then asks: Ki _m_ gotro 'si saumya, kima\n_k_ ara _h_ , 'friend, of what family art thou? what is thy rule of conduct?'\n\n[114:3](sbe0241.htm#fr_583) The object of this Sutra is to show the absolute\nnecessity of feeding a guest. For, if offended, he might burn the house with\nthe flames of his anger.\n\n[115:4](sbe0241.htm#fr_584) The object of this Sutra is to complete the\ndefinition of the term 'guest' to be given in the following Sutra. In my\ntranslation I have followed Haradatta's gloss. The literal sense of\n\xc3\x82pastamba's words is,. 'He who, observing the law, has studied one recension\nof each (of the four) Vedas, becomes a _S_ rotriya.' Haradatta says this\ndefinition would be contrary to the current acceptation of the term. That\nargument proves, however, nothing for \xc3\x82pastamba's times.\n\n[115:5](sbe0241.htm#fr_585) Manu III, 102, 103; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 111.\n\n[115:6](sbe0241.htm#fr_586) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 109; Manu III, 101.\n\n[115:8](sbe0241.htm#fr_587) Haradatta states that this is also \xc3\x82pastamba's\nopinion.\n\n[115:11](sbe0241.htm#fr_588) According to Haradatta, \xc3\x82pastamba is of opinion\nthat it should be brought in a pot made of metal.\n\n[116:12](sbe0241.htm#fr_589) I.e. it is unnecessary to offer water for washing\nthe feet to a student.\n\n[116:15](sbe0241.htm#fr_590) 'Ointment, (i.e.) oil or clarified butter for\nanointing the feet.'--Haradatta. Manu III, 107.\n\n[116:16](sbe0241.htm#fr_591) Manu III, 108.\n\n[116:19](sbe0241.htm#fr_592) Manu IV, 213; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 162.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 3, Kha _n_ _d_ a 7](sbe0242.htm)\n\n"
