He then sows (seed) of all (kinds of) herbs: what the all-herb\n(seed signified) on that occasion 3, that (it does) here. With many (verses 4)\nhe sows\n\np. 433\n\nthat (former seed), with a single one this,--he thus keeps the divine separate\nfrom what belongs to the Fathers,--with 1.\n\n13:8:3:22\\. He then pours out that (jarful of bones 2); for this earth is the\nfoundation: on this (earth), as a foundation, he thus establishes him. Before\nsunrise (he does so), for, in secret, as it were, are the Fathers, and in\nsecret, as it were, is the night;--in secret, indeed, he does this, (but) so\nthat (the sun) should rise over him doing it: on both day and night he thus\nestablishes him.\n\n13:8:3:33\\. [He does so, with Va _g_. S. XXXV, 5-6,] 'May Savit _ri_ deposit\nthy bones in the mother's lap,'--Savit _ri_ thus deposits his bones in the lap\nof the mother, this earth;--'O Earth, be thou propitious unto him!' he thus\nsays this in order that this (earth) may be propitious to him.--'In the deity\nPra _g_ apati I place thee, in the world nigh unto the water 3, O N.N.,'\ntherewith he mentions the name (of the deceased); for nigh to\n\np. 434\n\nthe water, indeed, is this (terrestrial) world: he thus places him in the\ndeity Pra _g_ apati, in the world nigh unto the water.\n\n13:8:3:44\\. He then says to some one, 'Proceed in that (southern) direction\nwithout drawing breath, and, having thrown down the jar, return hither without\nlooking behind thee!' He then mutters (Va _g_. S. XXXV, 7), 'O Death, go away\nanother way, what second way there is of thine other than the path of the gods\n1; I call unto thee that hast eyes and hearest: hurt not our family nor our\nmen!' for long life he thereby prays for these, and accordingly each\nsubsequent one of them dies of old age.\n\n13:8:3:55\\. He then arranges him (the dead man) limb by limb, with (Va _g_. S.\nXXXV, 8-9), 'Propitious be the wind unto thee, propitious the heat of the sun;\npropitious be the bricks; propitious be the fires unto thee, and may the\nearthly ones not scorch thee!--May the regions fit themselves to thee, and may\nthe waters be most kind unto thee, and the rivers; and kind. also the air: may\nall the regions fit themselves to thee!'--he thereby makes everything fit\nitself to him, and be auspicious for him.\n\n13:8:3:66\\. Now thirteen unmarked 2 bricks, measuring a foot (square), have\nbeen made: they are just like those bricks in the fire-altar. Those (altar\nbricks) he lays down with a formula, silently these: he thus keeps the divine\nseparate from what belongs to the Fathers.\n\np. 435\n\n13:8:3:77\\. There are thirteen of them,--thirteen months are a year: on the\nseasons, on the year, he thus establishes him, as on a firm foundation.\n\n13:8:3:88\\. They measure a foot (square),--the foot is a foundation: a\nfoundation he thus prepares for him. Unmarked they are, for in secret, as it\nwere, are the Fathers; and in secret, as it were, is what is unmarked: he thus\nsecretes what is in secret.\n\n13:8:3:99\\. One of them he places in the middle, with the front side towards\nthe east: this is the body (trunk);--three in front, fitted to (the position\nof) the head: that is the head;--three on the right; that is the right wing\n(side);--three on the left: that is the left wing;--three behind: that is the\ntail. Thus this his body, furnished with wings and tail, is just like that of\nAgni (the fire-altar).\n\n13:8:3:1010\\. He then bids them bring some soil from a cleft in the ground,\nfor thus the Fathers' (share) in this (earth) is not excessive; and he also\nthereby makes the (dead man's) sin to be restricted 1. And some, now, dig in\nthat intermediate (south-eastern) quarter, and fetch it from there; and\nothers, again, do so towards the south-west, and fetch it northwards from\nthere: he may do as he chooses.\n\n13:8:3:1111\\. Let him not make it (the sepulchral mound) too large, lest he\nmake the (deceased's) sin large. For a Kshatriya he may make it as high as a\nman with upstretched arms, for a Brahma _n_ a reaching up to the mouth, for a\nwoman up to the hips, for a Vai _s_ ya up to the thighs, for a _S_ udra up to\nthe knee; for suchlike is their vigour.\n\n13:8:3:1212\\. But let him rather make it so as to reach\n\np. 436\n\nbelow the knee: he thus leaves no room for another. While that (mound) is\nbeing made, they hold a bundle (of reed grass) to the left (north, uttarata\n_h_ ) of it,--that is offspring: they thus hold the (deceased's) offspring\nupwards (uttarata _h_ ). Do not let him throw it down either after holding it\nup, or after bringing it; but let him set it up in the house 1: he thus sets\nup offspring in the house.\n\n13:8:3:1313\\. Having prepared it, he sows barley grain (yava), thinking, 'May\nthey ward off (yavaya) sin from me!' He covers it over with Avaka-plants 2 in\norder that there may be joy (or moisture, ka) for him; and with Darbha grass\n(Poa cynosuroides) he covers it for the sake of softness.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[432:3](sbe44115.htm#fr_1155) Viz. that it means food of every kind, see VII,\n2, 4, 14.\n\n[432:4](sbe44115.htm#fr_1156) Viz. with fifteen verses (VII, 2, 4, 15 seqq.)\nof which the one here used formed part (part iii, p. 340, note 2, verse,).\n\n[433:1](sbe44115.htm#fr_1157) That is, they die of old age; just as do the\nherbs now sown to which the verse is, of course, addressed in the first place.\nCf.
