Naraya _n_ a said :-- In those Var _s_ as, Vi _sn_ u and the other Devas\nused to worship always the Great Devi with Japam and meditation and to chant\nhymns to Her. The forests there are ornamented with all sorts of fruits,\nflowers and leaves, in all the seasons. In those excellent forests, and on the\nmountains, in those Var _s_ as and on the clear waters interspersed with full\nblewn lotuses and S'arasas (cranes) and in those countries where varieties of\nmountain trees are standing and where varieties of birds frequent and echo all\naround, the people play in waters and engage themselves with a great many\npleasant occupations; and the beautiful women, as well, roam there with the\nknitting of their eyebrows. The people there enjoy as they like, surrounded by\nyoung women; Naraya _n_ a, the \xc3\x82dipuru _s_ a Bhagavan Himself, worships the\nDevi there, to shew his extreme grace to all the inhabitants of the Navavar\n_s_ a. The people also worship the Deity. By worshipping the Devi only, the\nBhagavan remains there in Samadhi, surrounded with Aniruddha and his other\nVyuhachatu _st_ aya (the four forms). But in Ilavrita Var _s_ a, the Bhagavan\nRudra, originated from the eye-brows of Brahma, resides only with women. No\nother person can enter there; for the Bhavani, the S'akti of Rudra has cursed\nthat any male entering there would be transformed into a female. The Lord of\nBhavani, surrounded by innumerable women, remains here engaged in the worship\nof the unmanifested unborn Bhagavan Samkar _s_ a _n_ a. For the good of\nhumanity, with intense meditation, He worships His Own Turiya Form of the\nnature of Tamas, thus :--\n\n\n\n12-19. S'ri Bhagavana said :-- \xc2\x93Obeisance to Thee! the Bhagavan, the Great\nPuru _s_ a, endowed with all the qualities (the principal six Ais'varyas or\nprosperities), the Ananta (the Infinite) and to the Unmanifested! We worship\nThee, Whose lotus feet are the refuge of all. Thou art the great storehouse of\nall the superhuman powers and the divine\n\n\n\np. 757\n\n\n\nfaculties of omnipotence, etc. Thou art always present to the Bhaktas. Thou\nart creating all these beings. Thou givest Mok _s_ a to the Bhaktas and\ndestroyest their attachment to the world and Thou bindest Thy non-devotees in\nbondage to this world. Thou art the Lord. We worship Thee. We are entirely\nunder the control of the passions, anger, etc., and our minds are always\nattached to the senses; but though Thou art always looking at this world for\nits creation, etc., Thy mind is not a bit attached to it. So who will not turn\nto Thee, desirous to conquer his self. Thou art appearing by Thy Maya as one\nwhose sight is ignorant; Thou lookest dreadful with Thy eyes reddened with the\ndrink of Madhu (wine). By the touch of Thy feet, the mental faculties are very\nmuch enchanted; hence the women folk of the Nagas cannot in any way worship\nThee, out of bashfulness. The Ri _s_ is say that though Thou art the Only One\nto create, preserve and destroy, yet Thou art quite unconcerned with them.\nThou art Infinite and Thou hast innumerable heads. This vast universe is like\nthe mustard seed resting somewhere on one of these heads, which Thou canst not\nfeel even. The Mahat Tattva is Thy body manifested first. It is built of\nSattva, Raja and Tamo Gu _n_ as. Brahma has come out of this and I again have\nsprung from this Brahma and am nurtured by the Sattva and the other Gu _n_ as\nand with the help of the Teja, created these elements and the senses. These\nMahat Tattvas and we all are controlled by Thy Extraordinary Form. Thou hast\nkept us in our respective places by Thy Kriya S'akti as birds are kept duly by\nthe strings through them. Mahat Tattva, Ahamkara, and the Devas, elements and\nthe senses, before mentioned all united create this Universe by Thy Grace. Thy\ncreation is very big and grand; for this reason the gross thinkers, deluded by\nThy power, never understand it. This Maya is the only means to get the Samsara\nNivritti, Mok _s_ a, the real Goal of man: and this Maya, again involves them\nin the Karma entanglements, very hard to get through. Coming in and going out,\nboth of these are Thy forms; so we bow down to Thee.\n\n\n\n20-23. Naraya _n_ a said :-- Thus the Bhagavan Rudra, with His Own persons in\nIlavrita Var _s_ a used to worship the Devi and the Sankar _s_ a _n_ a, the\nController of all the Lokas. The son of Dharma, well known by the name of\nBhadras'rava and all the persons born of his family and his attendants,\nworship thus the Devi. This form is well known to all by the name of Hayagriva\nand worshipped thus. All the persons there worship Him with the intense\nmeditation and Samadhi and realise Him thoroughly. Then they praise Him,\naccording to due customs and get the thorough Siddhis (success in getting\nextraordinary powers).\n\n\n\np. 758\n\n\n\n24-29. The Bhadras'ravas said :-- Obeisance to Thee, the Bhagavan, the\nIncarnate of Virtue, and to Him who destroys completely the desires,\nattachments, etc., to worldly objects! Ho! How wonderful are the feats of the\nBhagavan! Death always destroys all, but people, seeing this, seem not to see\nthis. Seeing that the son meets with death, the father desires to live long\nnot for a virtuous purpose but for sense enjoyments, what is called Vikarma.\nThose who are skilled in J\xc3\xb1ana and Vij\xc3\xb1ana say that this Universe that is seen\nis very transient. Moreover those Pundits who are endowed with much J\xc3\xb1ana, see\nvividly the transitoriness of this Universe. Still, O Unborn One! When\npractically they come to deal with this, they all become overpowered with the\ninfluence of Maya. So Thy Pastime (Lila) is wonderfully variegated. (Instead\nof spending our time uselessly in discussing on S'astras) we bow down to Thee,\nand Thee alone. Thou art the Self-manifest Chaitanya. Thou are not the object\nto be covered by Maya. Thou dost not do anything in the sort of creation, etc.\nThou remainest simply as the Witness thereof. Sill the Vedas declare that Thou\ncreatest, preservest and destroyest the Universe. It is quite reasonable and\nnothing to be wondered at. Thou art the \xc3\x82tman of all. When the Pralaya (the\ntime of great dissolution) comes, the Vedas were stolen by the Daityas and\ntaken to the nether regions, the Rasatala. Thou, in the form of Hayagriva\n(Horse-faced), rescued the Vedas and gave them to the Grandsire Brahma who was\nvery eager to get them back and understand their meanings. Thou art the true\nSankalap (resolve); we bow down to Thee. Thus the Bhadras'ravas praise the\nHaiyagriva form of Hari and sing the glorious deeds of Him. He who reads these\nnarratives of the Maha Puru _s_ a (the high-souled personage) or he who makes\nothers hear these things, both of them, quitting their sinful bodies, go to\nthe Devi Loka.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the description of Ilavrita\nin the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar\n_s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 9](bk08ch09.htm)\n\n"
