Thereby the omnipresence (of Brahman is established), in accordance with\nthe statements about (Brahman's) extent.\n\nThe preceding demonstration that the texts calling Brahman a bank, and so on,\nare not to be taken literally, and that, on the other hand, the texts denying\nall plurality must be accepted as they stand., moreover, serves to prove that\nthe Self is omnipresent. If the former texts were taken literally, banks and\nthe like would have to be looked upon as belonging to the Self, and thence it\nwould follow that the Self is limited. And if the texts of the latter class\nwere not accepted as valid, there would be substances exclusive of each other,\nand thus the Self would again be limited.--That the Self is omnipresent\nfollows from the texts proclaiming its extent, &c., cp. _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1, 3,\n'As large as this ether is, so large is that ether within the heart;' 'Like\nthe ether, he is omnipresent and eternal;' 'He is greater than the sky,\ngreater than the ether' ( _S_ at. Br. X, 6, 3, 2); 'He is eternal,\nomnipresent, firm, immoveable' (Bha. Gita II, 24); and other similar passages\nfrom _S_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 38](sbe38141.htm)\n\n"
