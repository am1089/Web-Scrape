With the exception of world-energy; on account of leading subject-matter\nand of non-proximity.\n\nThe doubt here presents itself whether the power of the released soul is a\nuniversal power such as belongs to the Supreme Person, extending to the\ncreation, sustentation, and so on, of the worlds; or is limited to the\nintuition of the Supreme Person.--The Purvapakshin maintains the former view.\nFor he says Scripture declares that the soul reaches equality with the Supreme\nPerson: 'Free from stain he reaches the highest equality' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 3);\nand moreover Scripture ascribes to the released soul the power of realising\nall its thoughts. And these two conditions are not fulfilled unless the soul\npossess the special powers of the Lord with regard to the government, &c., of\nthe world.--To this the Sutra replies, 'with the exception of world-energy.'\nThe released soul, freed from all that hides its true nature, possesses the\npower of intuitively beholding the pure Brahman, but does not possess the\npower of ruling and guiding the different forms of motion and rest belonging\nto animate and inanimate nature.--How is this known?--'From subject-matter.'\nFor it is with special reference to the highest Brahman\n\np. 767\n\nonly that the text mentions ruling and controlling power over the entire\nworld. 'That from whence these beings are born, that through which they live\nwhen born, that into which they enter at death, endeavour to know that; that\nis Brahman' (Taitt. Up. III, 1, 1). If such universal ruling and controlling\npower belonged to the released soul as well, it would not be used--as the text\nactually uses it--for defining Brahman; for all definition rests on special\nindividual attributes. Analogously many other texts speak of universal ruling\nand controlling power with exclusive reference to the Supreme Person--'Being\nonly this was in the beginning, &c.--it thought, may I be many' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVI, 2); 'In the beginning this was Brahman, one only--it created the most\nexcellent Kshattra,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 11); 'In the beginning all this\nwas Self, one only--it thought, let me send forth these worlds' (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II,\n4, 1, 1); 'There was Naraya _n_ a alone, not Brahma, and so on.' 'He who\ndwelling within the earth,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 3).--This also follows\n'from non-proximity'; for in all those places which speak of world-controlling\npower the context in no way suggests the idea of the released soul, and hence\nthere is no reason to ascribe such power to the latter.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 18. ... that which abides within the spheres of those entrusted with\nspecial functions](sbe48569.htm)\n\n"
