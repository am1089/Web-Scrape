Verily, those who become initiated for (a sacrificial session of)\na year cross an ocean: the Praya _n_ iya Atiratra is a flight of steps 2, for\nit is by means of a flight of steps that one enters (the water); and\n\np. 146\n\nwhen they enter on the Praya _n_ iya Atiratra it is just as if they were\nentering the ocean by a flight of steps.\n\n12:2:1:22\\. The _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a day is (in the form of) a foothold, a\nshallow place 1, such a one as (where the water reaches) either to the arm-\npits or to the neck, whence, having rested, they enter 2 (the deep water). The\nAbhiplava is (a spot) suitable for swimming; and so is the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya\nsuitable for swimming.\n\n12:2:1:33\\. The Abhi _g_ it is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as\n(where the water reaches) either to the arm-pits, or to the neck, whence,\nhaving rested, they come out (of the water). The first Svarasaman is thigh-\ndeep, the second knee-deep, the third knuckle-deep. The Vishuvat is a foothold\n(in the form of) an island. The first (Svarasaman) with reversed Samans is\nknuckle-deep, the second knee-deep, and the third thigh-deep.\n\n12:2:1:44\\. The Vi _s_ va _g_ it is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as\n(where the water reaches) either to the arm-pits or to the neck, whence,\nhaving rested, he enters (the deep water again). The P _ri_ sh _th_ ya is\nsuitable for swimming, and so is the Abhiplava, and so are the Go and \xc3\x82yus,\nand so is the Da _s_ aratra.\n\n12:2:1:55\\. The Mahavrata is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as (where\nthe water reaches) either to the arm-pits or to the neck, whence, having\nrested,\n\np. 147\n\nthey step out (of the water). The Udayaniya (concluding) Atiratra is a flight\nof steps, for it is by a flight of steps that people step out (of the water):\nthus, when they perform the Udayaniya Atiratra, it is just as if, having\nentered the sea by a flight of steps, they were to step out of it, by a flight\nof steps.\n\n12:2:1:66\\. Regarding this they say, 'How many Atiratras are there in the\nyear, how many Agnish _t_ omas, how many Ukthyas, how many Sho _d_ a _s_ ins,\nhow many Sha _d_ ahas?'--Two Atiratras, a hundred and six Agnish _t_ omas, and\ntwo hundred and forty Ukthyas,--thus in the case of those who perform the\nSvarasamans as Ukthyas.\n\n12:2:1:77\\. But in the case of those who perform them as Agnish _t_ omas, a\nhundred and twelve Agnish _t_ omas, two hundred and thirty-four Ukthyas,\ntwelve Sho _d_ a _s_ ins, and sixty Sha _d_ ahas. This, then, is how the year\nis obtained.\n\n12:2:1:88\\. There are twelve months in the year, and their vital energy and\npower are the P _ri_ sh _th_ as; and by performing the P _ri_ sh _th_ as month\nby month, they obtain, in monthly portions 1, that vital energy of the\nyear.--'And how do they obtain the vital energy of the thirteenth\n(intercalary) month?' Well, subsequent to the Vishuvat day they perform the Vi\n_s_ va _g_ it Agnish _t_ oma with all the P _ri_ sh _th_ as 2, and thus indeed\nthey obtain the vital energy of the thirteenth month.\n\n12:2:1:99\\. Now, concerning this, _S_ vetaketu \xc3\x82ru _n_ eya,\n\np. 148\n\nknowing this, once said, 'I am now going to get myself initiated for one\nyear.' His father, looking at him, said, 'Knowest thou, long-lived one, the\nfording-footholds of the year?'--'I know them,' he replied, for, indeed, he\nsaid this as one knowing it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[145:2](sbe44049.htm#fr_440) Or, a descent, a passage leading down to a\nbathing-place.\n\n[146:1](sbe44049.htm#fr_441) Gadham eva pratish _th_ a,--it may be remarked\nthat this is just the form in which an appositional compound is analyzed by\nnative grammarians, as if it were 'gadha-pratish _th_ a,' a foothold which is\njust a ford, a ford-foothold, as indeed it is written in paragraph 9. Cf. p.\n66, note 4.\n\n[146:2](sbe44049.htm#fr_442) Or, bathe,--'prasnati,' indeed, would really seem\nto mean here 'he swims forward.'\n\n[147:1](sbe44049.htm#fr_443) Lit., by the month, i.e. by monthly instalments;\ncf.
