Here, now, they say, 'Whereby are the Abhiplavas possessed of\nlight ( _g_ yotis) on both sides 1,\n\np. 149\n\nand the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya of light on one side only?' Well, the Abhiplavas are\nthese worlds, and these worlds are indeed possessed of light on both sides--\nthrough the fire on this side, and through the sun on yonder side; and the P\n_ri_ sh _th_ ya is the seasons, and the seasons are indeed possessed, of light\non one side only: he who burns yonder (the sun) is their light.\n\n12:2:2:22\\. Verily, those two wheels of the gods, established on the P _ri_ sh\n_th_ ya 1, revolve crushing 2 the Sacrificer's evil; and, indeed, if during a\nsacrificial session any one speaks evil of such initiates as know this, those\ntwo wheels of the gods cut off his head: the (chariot-) seat is the Da _s_\naratra, and the two wheels are the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya and Abhiplava.\n\n12:2:2:33\\. Concerning this they say, 'Seeing that the two wheels (of a cart)\nare alike, and those stomas unlike, how are those stomas one after another\nperformed alike for him?' Let him reply, 'Thereby, that there are six of the\none, and six of the other.'\n\n12:2:2:44\\. 'Let him make the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya and Abhiplava two warps 3,'\nsaid Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gya; 'let him make their\n\np. 150\n\n[paragraph continues] Stotras and _S_ astras run together:' inasmuch as he\nmakes them run together, these (channels of the) vital airs, though separate\nfrom one another, run together, with one and the same aim 1, into a common\nweb; but were he not to make them run together, the Sacrificer would be liable\nto perish; and liable to perish, indeed, is one who is either blind or deaf.\n\n12:2:2:55\\. The Agnish _t_ omas amount to nine in a month 2;--now, there are\nnine vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus lays into them (the\nSacrificers); and thus they attain the full term of life, and so, indeed, they\ndo not depart this world before the (full) term of life.\n\n12:2:2:66\\. And the Ukthyas (amount) to twenty-one;--now, there are twelve\nmonths in the year, five seasons, and three worlds, that makes twenty, and he\nwho burns yonder (the sun) is the twenty-first 3,\n\np. 151\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--that consummation (he attains), and by that\nconsummation he ascends month by month to the world of heaven, and gains, in\nmonthly portions, the world of heaven, and the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and the\nB _ri_ hati metre 1.\n\n12:2:2:77\\. The Agnish _t_ omas amount to thirty-four in a month 2\\--for the\nobtainment of all the gods; for there are thirty-three gods, and Pra _g_ apati\nis the thirty-fourth. And there is one Ukthya with the Sho _d_ a _s_ in\n(stotra); for the Ukthya means food, and the Sho _d_ a _s_ in vital strength.\n\n12:2:2:88\\. By means of that food and vital strength the gods obtained all\ntheir desires, and secured all their desires; and in like manner does this\n(Sacrificer); by means of that food and vital strength, obtain all his\ndesires, and secure all his desires: with a view to that object he who is\ninitiated for (a sacrificial session of) a year should therefore perform the P\n_ri_ sh _th_ ya and Abhiplava (-sha _d_ ahas).\n\np. 152\n\n12:2:2:99\\. Now, the \xc3\x82dityas and the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_\napati, were contending together saying, 'We shall be the first to reach\nheaven,--we shall be the first!'\n\n12:2:2:1010\\. By means of four Stomas, four P _ri_ sh _th_ as 1, and light\n(simple) hymn-tunes, the \xc3\x82dityas sailed across to the heavenly world; and\ninasmuch as they sailed (abhi-plu) to it, they (these six-days' periods) are\ncalled Abhiplava.\n\n12:2:2:1111\\. By means of all the Stomas, all the P _ri_ sh _th_ as 2, and\nheavy (complicated) hymn-tunes, the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, coming after (the gods), as it\nwere 3, touched (reached) the heavenly world; and inasmuch as they touched (sp\n_ri_ _s_ ) it, it (this six-days' period) is called P _ri_ sh _th_ ya 4.\n\n12:2:2:1212\\. It is a six-days' Abhiplava, because it consists of six days; or\na five-days' Abhiplava, because it consists of five days, for the last day is\nthe same as the first; or a four-days' Abhiplava, for there are four Stomas\n(used) in it--the thrice-threefold (triv _ri_ t), the fifteen-versed, the\nseventeen-versed, and the twenty-one-versed one; or a three-days' Abhiplava,\nfor it is of three orders-- _G_ yotis, Go, and\n\np. 153\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc3\x82yus 1; or a two-days' Abhiplava, for there are two\nSamans (used) in it--the B _ri_ hat and the Rathantara 2; or a one-day's\nAbhiplava, for it is performed with the Stomas of a one-day's (Soma-sacrifice\n3). Twelve Stotras and twelve _S_ astras of the four Ukthyas are in excess\n4\\--they make a seventh Agnish _t_ oma, and thus the Agnish _t_ omas amount to\nseven.\n\n12:2:2:1313\\. Now, Proti Kau _s_ ambeya 5 Kausurubindi dwelt with Uddalaka \xc3\x82ru\n_n_ i as a religious student. The teacher asked him, 'My son, how many days\ndid thy father 6 consider that there are in the year?'\n\n12:2:2:1414\\. 'Ten,' he replied.--'Ten, indeed,' he said; 'for the Vira _g_\nconsists of ten syllables, and the sacrifice is of Vira _g_ nature;--\n\n15\\. But how many are there really?'--'Nine,' he replied.--'Nine, indeed,' he\nsaid; 'for there are nine vital airs, and by means of the vital airs the\nsacrifice is performed;--\n\np. 154\n\n12:2:2:1616\\. But how many are there really?'--'Eight,' he replied.--'Eight,\nindeed,' he said; 'for the Gayatri consists of eight syllables, and the\nsacrifice is of Gayatri nature;--\n\n12:2:2:1717\\. But how many are there really?'--'Seven,' he replied.--'Seven,\nindeed,' he said; 'for there are seven metres (successively) increasing by\nfour (syllables), and by means of the metres the sacrifice is performed;--\n\n12:2:2:1818\\. But how many are there really?'--'Six,' he replied.--'Six,\nindeed,' he said; 'six seasons make up a year, and the sacrifice is the year;\nand one and the same day are those two, the opening and concluding (Atiratra\n1);--\n\n12:2:2:1919\\. But how many are there really?'--'Five,' he replied.--'Five,\nindeed,' he said; 'the sacrifice is fivefold; the sacrificial animal is\nfivefold 2; there are five seasons in the year, and the sacrifice is the year;\n\np. 155\n\nand one and the same day are those two, the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a and the\nMahavrata.;--\n\n12:2:2:2020\\. But how many are there really?'--'Four,' he replied.--'Four,\nindeed,' he said; 'animals are four-footed, and animals constitute a\nsacrifice; and one and the same day are those two, the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya and\nAbhiplava;--\n\n12:2:2:2121\\. But how many are there really?'--'Three,' he replied.--'Three,\nindeed,' he said; 'there are three metres, three worlds; and the (Soma-)\nsacrifice consists of three services; and one and the same day are those two,\nthe Abhi _g_ it and Vi _s_ va _g_ it;--\n\n12:2:2:2222\\. But how many are there really?'--'Two,' he replied.--'Two,\nindeed,' he said; 'for man is two-footed, and the sacrifice is man; and one\nand the same day are the Svarasamans;--\n\n12:2:2:2323\\. But how many are there really?'--'One,' he replied.--'A day,\nindeed,' he said; 'the whole year is just that day after day:'--this is the\nmystic import of the year; and, verily, whosoever thus knows this mystic\nimport 1 of the year grows more (and more) glorious up to (the end of) it; he\nbecomes possessed of a (new) body, he becomes the year, and in the shape of\nthe year he joins the gods.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[148:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_445) The difference between the Abhiplava-sha _d_ aha\nand the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha was thus explained in part iii, introd.,\np. xxi, note 2:--'In both kinds of sha _d_ aha, the P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotras\n(at the Madhyandina-savana) are performed in the ordinary way--viz. either in\nthe Agnish _t_ oma or the Ukthya way (see ib., p. xvi, note 2, as the correct\nreference is);--but whilst, in the Abhiplava-sha _d_ aha, the Rathantara and B\n_ri_ hat-samans are used for the Hot _ri_ 's P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra on\nalternate days, the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha requires a different P _ri_\nsh _th_ a-saman on each of the six days. The two kinds of sha _d_ ahas also\ndiffer entirely in regard to the sequence of Stomas prescribed for the\nperformance of the Stotras.' It is this difference in the 'sequence of Stomas'\nwhich is referred to in our passage. On the six days of the Abhiplava-sha _d_\naha, the sequence of Stomas (the first four of which, viz. Triv _ri_ t, Pa _\xc3\xb1_\n_k_ ada _s_ a, Saptada _s_ a, and Ekavi _m_ _s_ a, are only used) varies from\nday to day in this way: 1. _G_ yotish _t_ oma; 2. Gosh _t_ oma; 3. \xc3\x82yush _t_\noma; 4. Gosh _t_ oma; 5. \xc3\x82yush _t_ oma; 6. _G_ yotish _t_ oma (for the\ndifference between these, see part iv, p. 287, note 2). It will thus be seen\nthat the Abhiplava has the ' _g_ yotih (stoma)' on both sides, on the first\nand the last days. For the Hot _ri_ 's P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra on these\nsuccessive days the Rathantara-saman and B _ri_ hat-saman are used; and, as\nthe Gosh _t_ oma and \xc3\x82yush _t_ oma are Ukthya-days, the usual practice which\nrequires the B _ri_ hat-saman for such days, is not followed; just as the\nfinal _G_ yotish _t_ oma in this case requires the B _ri_ hat-saman.--As\nregards the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha, each successive day requires for\nits stotras a single Stoma, in the ascending order: Triv _ri_ t, Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_\nada _s_ a, Saptada _s_ a, Ekavi _m_ _s_ a, Tri _n_ ava, Trayastri _m_ _s_\na;--a different P _ri_ sh _th_ a-saman being used for the Hot _ri_ 's P _ri_\nsh _th_ a-stotra p. 149 on each of the six days. Here only the first day has\nthe same Stoma at the beginning, as the _G_ yotish _t_ oma,--whence it has '\n_g_ yotis' on one side only.\n\n[149:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_446) This 'p _ri_ sh _th_ yapratish _th_ ite' looks\nrather strange,--perhaps the correct reading is 'p _ri_ sh _th_ apratish _th_\nite,' 'established on the p _ri_ sh _th_ a-samans'; unless, indeed, 'pratish\n_th_ ita' has to be understood here to refer to the Abhiplava, as the\nestablished, or ordinary, Sha _d_ aha, which doubtless would make the best\nsense,--'those two wheels of the gods, the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya and the\nestablished (Abhiplava-) sha _d_ aha.'\n\n[149:2](sbe44050.htm#fr_447) Or, as we would rather say, whilst revolving,\ncrush the Sacrificer's evil.\n\n[149:3](sbe44050.htm#fr_448) ? Or, possibly, two kinds of threads, those of\nthe warp and the woof (or weft), which are combined into one web. The St.\nPetersb. p. 150 Dict., on the other hand, takes 'tantra' here in the sense of\n'model form, type,'--and, indeed, the one meaning constantly passes into the\nother. The MS. of the comm. is too corrupt to be of much use.\n\n[150:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_449) This is a doubtful rendering of 'ekoti.' Though,\ndoubtless, the juxtaposition of 'ekoti' and 'samanam utim' cannot be\naccidental, the word 'uti' may probably have a different derivation and\nmeaning in the two occurrences. Cf. Kern, Saddharmapu _n_ _d_ arika, introd.,\np. xvii; Journ. of the Pali Text Society, 1885, pp. 32-38.\n\n[150:2](sbe44050.htm#fr_450) During five complete months of the first half,\nand four complete months of the second half, of the year four Abhiplava-sha\n_d_ ahas and one P _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha are performed. Now, the six\nclays of the Abhiplava-sha _d_ aha consist of 1. Agnish _t_ oma; 2-5. Ukthyas;\n6. Agnish _t_ oma; and those of the P _ri_ sh _th_ ya-sha _d_ aha of 1. Agnish\n_t_ oma; 2. 3. Ukthya; 4. Sho _d_ a _s_ in; 5.6. Ukthya. For the four\nAbhiplavas and the one P _ri_ sh _th_ ya of each month this, accordingly,\ngives nine Agnish _t_ omas, twenty Ukthyas, and one Sho _d_ a _s_ in (counted,\nhowever, as an Ukthya in [paragraphs 6](sbe44050.htm#12:2:2:6) and\n[7](sbe44050.htm#12:2:2:7)).\n\n[150:3](sbe44050.htm#fr_451) The reason why the Sun is so often referred to as\nthe twenty-first or twenty-one-fold, is not easy to discover. Possibly it may\nbe from the fact that the Vishuvat day, or central day of the great session\nand the longest day of the year, is identified with the Sun, p. 151 and that\nthis day is flanked on both sides by ten special days which together with the\ncentral day, form a special group of twenty-one days. But, on the other hand,\nit may be exactly the other way, viz. that this central group was made one of\ntwenty-one nays because of the already recognised epithet of \xc3\x82ditya as the\n'ekavi _m_ _s_ a.' Cf. A. Hillebrandt, Die Sonnwendfeste in Alt-Indien, p. 6\nseq.\n\n[151:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_452) Here the twenty-one Ukthyas are symbolically\nidentified with the twenty-one-versed hymn-form; and the nine Agnish _t_ omas\n(of [paragraph 5](sbe44050.htm#12:2:2:5)) with the B _ri_ hati metre which\nconsists of four padas of nine syllables each.\n\n[151:2](sbe44050.htm#fr_453) This number is evidently arrived at by counting\nthe twenty Ukthyas as Agnish _t_ omas (hence 9 + 20), and adding thereto five\nmore Agnish _t_ omas obtained by the calculation referred to in paragraph 12\n(see note thereon), according to which the characteristic Stotras and Sastras\nof the Ukthya make one additional Agnish _t_ oma in every four Ukthyas. The\nSho _d_ a _s_ in, thus, is not taken into account in this calculation.\n\n[152:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_454) Besides the Rathantara and B _ri_ hat, used on\nalternate days for the Hot _ri_ 's P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra at the Abhiplava,\nthe Vamadevya and Kaleya-samans, used on each day for the Maitravaru _n_ a's\nand A _k_ _kh_ avaka's P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotras, seem to be counted here as\nmaking up the four P _ri_ sh _th_ a-samans of the Abhiplava-sha _d_ aha. For\nthe four Stomas, see [p. 148](sbe44049.htm#page_148), note.\n\n[152:2](sbe44050.htm#fr_455) See ib., and part iii, introd., p. xxi.\n\n[152:3](sbe44050.htm#fr_456) The 'iva' would seem here (as, indeed, pretty\nfrequently) to have the meaning of 'eva,' 'indeed,' thus--coming considerably\nafter (the gods). Cf. Ait.-Brahm. IV, 17, 5, where the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras are said to\nhave reached heaven sixty years after the \xc3\x82dityas.\n\n[152:4](sbe44050.htm#fr_457) This etymology is of course not meant to be taken\nseriously, the word 'p _ri_ sh _th_ ya' being derived from 'p _ri_ sh _th_ a,'\n'back' ([XII, 1, 4, 1](sbe44048.htm#12:1:4:1)).\n\n[153:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_458) See [p. 148](sbe44049.htm#page_148), note; part\niv, p. 287, note 2.\n\n[153:2](sbe44050.htm#fr_459) These two principal P _ri_ sh _th_ a-samans are\nused on alternate days of the Abhiplava-sha _d_ aha for the first (or Hot _ri_\n's) P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra at the midday-service.\n\n[153:3](sbe44050.htm#fr_460) Viz. with the four Stomas used at the ordinary\nAgnish _t_ oma-sacrifice.\n\n[153:4](sbe44050.htm#fr_461) Whilst the Agnish _t_ oma includes twelve Stotras\nand twelve _S_ astras, the Ukthya-sacrifice has three additional (Uktha-)\nStotras and Sastras, which in the four Ukthya days of the Abhiplava-sha _d_\naha make up another twelve chants and twelve recitations.\n\n[153:5](sbe44050.htm#fr_462) That is, either a descendant of Ku _s_ amba; or,\nas Harisvamin takes it, a native of the city Kau _s_ ambi; cf. Weber, Ind.\nStud. I, p. 193.--Prak _ri_ sh _t_ abhupati-ko _s_ ambinivasi-\nkusurabindasyapatyam; MS. comm.\n\n[153:6](sbe44050.htm#fr_463) Harisvamin applies to the father the epithet\n'mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ika,' or performer of the great sacrifices.\n\n[154:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_464) In the scheme of the Gavam ayanam, given above\n([p. 139](sbe44046.htm#page_139), note [1](sbe44046.htm#fn_425)), there is one\nday in excess of the year, viz. either the central Vishuvat day ([XII, 2, 3,\n6](sbe44051.htm#12:2:3:6)) or the final Atiratra; but by making this latter\nday identical with the opening Atiratra, Uddalaka would seem to bring the\nwhole within the compass of one year of six seasons. In the next paragraph, on\nthe other hand, the same result is obtained by the identification of the\nsecond and the last but one days of the session. Another, and perhaps more\nprobable, explanation of Uddalaka's calculation would, however, be this. In\nthe scheme of the sacrificial session there occur, as not included in the\ndifferent sacrificial groups or periods (the sha _d_ ahas, svarasamans, &c.),\nseven special days--the opening and final Atiratras, the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a\nand Mahavrata days, and the Abhi _g_ it, Vishuvat, and Vi _s_ va _g_ it days.\nThese seven days he here successively reduces to six and five days. The\nfurther reduction of this number by the identification of the P _ri_ sh _th_\nya and Abhiplava, as well as of the Svarasaman days, requires no explanation.\nCf., however, the Addenda.\n\n[154:2](sbe44050.htm#fr_465) For the 'pa\xe1\xb9\x85kta' nature of the sacrifice, see\nIII, 1, 4, 19. 20; [XIII, 2, 5, 1](sbe44087.htm#13:2:5:1), for the five kinds\nof sacrificial animals, VI, 1, 2, 32 seqq.\n\n[155:1](sbe44050.htm#fr_466) Prof. Oldenberg (Zeitschr. d. Deutschen Morg.\nGes., vol. 50, p. 460) takes 'upanishad' in the sense of 'worship'--'this is\nthe worship to be offered to the year.' Perhaps 'meditation' might be the more\nappropriate rendering:--'this is the form in which the year should be\nmeditated upon.' Cf. X, 4, 5, 1; 5, I, 1.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 2, 3.
