'Food, water, roots and fruits, and whatsoever else _S_ raddha-food\nthere may be: even when he has (only) accepted thereof, the study should be\ninterrupted; the Brahma _n_ a's hand is his mouth; so it is taught.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[115:2](sbe29069.htm#fr_260) 7, 2. The translation of akalam given in my\nGerman edition (Wahrend der betreffenden Zeit) is wrong: comp. the commentary\nthere quoted at p. 150; Gautama XVI, 22; Professor Stenzler's note on\nParaskara II, II, 2.\n\n[115:7_6](sbe29069.htm#fr_261) Agha _m_ sapi _n_ _d_ asodakayor mara _n_ a\n_m_. Naraya _n_ a.\n\n[115:7](sbe29069.htm#fr_262) According to Naraya _n_ a the _k_ a at the end of\nthis Sutra would p. 116 be intended to convey the meaning that on the pratipad\ndays of each fortnight the study should also be interrupted.\n\n[116:8](sbe29069.htm#fr_263) The translation of nabhya is quite conjectural.\nNaraya _n_ a gives a different meaning to this word; comp. p. 150 of the\nGerman edition.\n\n[116:11](sbe29069.htm#fr_264) \xc3\x82 _k_ aryaputradaya _h_. Naraya _n_ a.\n\n[116:21](sbe29069.htm#fr_265) The reason why the recitation of the Rig-veda is\nforbidden when the sound of a Saman is heard, becomes manifest, for instance,\nfrom \xc3\x82pastamba I, to, 7, where the discontinuance of the Veda-study is\nprescribed when the barking of dogs, the braying of asses, the cry of a wolf,\n&c., the sound of musical instruments, of weeping, and of a Saman is heard.\nLoud sounds like these would disturb the recitation of _Ri_ _k_ or Ya _g_ us\ntexts. A very curious opinion has been recently brought forward by Professor\nAufrecht (see his edition of the Rig-veda, second edition, vol. ii, p.\nxxxviii) that the incompatibility of the recitation of _Ri_ _k_ hymns and of\nSamans 'beruht auf der Kenntniss von der Willkur and der zum Theil unwurdigen\nWeise, in welcher der alte Text des Rig-veda in diesem Gesangbuche (i.e. the\nSamavedar _k_ ika) behandelt ist.'\n\n[117:23](sbe29069.htm#fr_266) Gramara _n_ ye gramam (read, grama?) evara _n_\nya _m_ vana _m_ tatra nadhiyita. Naraya _n_ a.\n\n[117:29](sbe29069.htm#fr_267) Except during the rainy season. Naraya _n_ a.\n\n[117:45](sbe29069.htm#fr_268) Naraya _n_ a also understands maithuna, and I\nthink that the German translation ought to be corrected accordingly.\n\n[118:53](sbe29069.htm#fr_269) I think that this Sutra contains two different\nrules which have to be separated, viz. 1. vidyutstanayitnuvarshavar _g_ a _m_\nkalpe; 2. varshavad ardhashash _th_ eshu. The first of these rules would\nextend the cases of anadhyaya mentioned in this chapter to the study of the\nKalpa-sutra, except the cases of lightning, rain, &c. The second would refer\nto the five months and a half following on the Utsarga ceremony (comp. chap.\n6, 8), and would imply that during this time the same texts are to be studied\nor not, according as their study is allowed or forbidden during rainfall: i.e.\nthe study of the Sa _m_ hita is to be discontinued, while that of the Kalpa is\nallowed to go on. Rama _k_ andra and Naraya _n_ a differ from this\ninterpretation; see p. 151 of the German edition.\n\n[118:55](sbe29069.htm#fr_270) Comp.
