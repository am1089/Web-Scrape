Vyasa said :-- The six sons of Devaki being thus killed by Kamsa and the\nseventh womb being miscarried, Kamsa began, when Devaki was pregnant for the\neighth time, to think of the cause of his own death as advised by Narada and\nwatched carefully, day and night, so that this time there would be born a son\nand there be no miscarriage.\n\n\n\n3\\. On the other hand the Bhagavan Hari came down and rested on the body of\nVasudeva as part incarnate and then entered into the womb of Devaki, in due\norder.\n\n\n\n4\\. That very time the Goddess Yogamaya, of Her own accord, enters into the\nwomb of Yasoda in order to help the workings of the gods.\n\n\n\n5\\. Rohini, the wife of Vasudeva was anxiously dwelling at that time through\nthe fear of Kamsa in the Nanda Gokula; Balarama, the part incarnate of Ananta,\ntook his birth there as Her son.\n\n\n\n6\\. Kamsa then imprisoned Devaki, who was being worshipped by gods, and\nengaged servants to take care of her.\n\n\n\n7\\. Vasudeva, too, entered into the prison with his wife Devaki, thinking of\nhis issue and also being attracted by his attachment towards his wife.\n\n\n\np. 338\n\n\n\n8\\. Vi _sn_ u, here, the Deva of the Devas, to accomplish the purpose of the\ngods began to grow regularly in the womb of Devaki, being incessantly adored\nand praised by the gods.\n\n\n\n9-10. When the tenth month was complete, on the eighth day of the dark\nfortnight, under the star Rohini, Kamsa became much bewildered with fear and\ncalled on his Danava followers and said \xc2\x93You must all carefully protect Devaki\nin the prison.\n\n\n\n11-12. The son born from this eighth womb of Devaki will turn out my dire\nenemy; therefore do you all very carefully protect that child, my death\nincarnate (so that the child may not be transferred anywhere else). O Daityas!\nI will be able to sleep without any anxiety then, when I will be successful.\nKill this eighth son of Devaki who has become the source of my constant\nworries and endless troubles.\n\n\n\n13\\. Equipped with swords, shafts and bow and darts do you all incessantly\nwatch with eyes open on all sides, leaving off your sleep and drowsiness.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n14\\. Vyasa said :-- Thus ordering the Demons, the king Kamsa who had become\nworn out with this anxiety and was bewildered with fear, went quickly to his\nown palace room; but he could not find any trace of happiness.\n\n\n\n15-18. On the other hand, Devaki, at dead of night, in that prison, told\nVasudeva \xc2\x93O king! My birth pain has come; I see here many guards, terrific,\nwho are watching and protecting us; what shall I do now? Yasoda, the wife of\nNanda, promised me before this. O respected one! Your heart is almost burnt up\nwith the fire of grief; therefore do you send to my house your son; I will\nprotect it with utmost care; and especially to incur Kamsa\xc2\x92s faith and belief,\nI will give you another son. O Lord! This is now a very hard moment; what are\nwe to do now?\n\n\n\n19\\. And again how are you to exchange the two sons? However let what may\ncome, come to pass; now the moment of child birth has come; I am possessed by\na feeling of shame not liable to be overcome. You better turn away your face;\nthere is no other remedy here.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n20\\. Thus saying to that blessed Vasudeva, worshipped by the gods, Devaki, at\ndead of night, delivered a wonderful child.\n\n\n\n21\\. The blessed Devaki looking on that exceedingly beautiful child, was\nstruck with wonder and told her husband, her whole body being filled with joy.\n\n\n\n22\\. O Lord! Look at the face of your new born child, a very rare thing to see\nsuch a face as this. Alas! The son of my paternal uncle, Kamsa, will kill my\nthis new born child.\n\n\n\np. 339\n\n\n\n23\\. \xc2\x93Kamsa will do so.\xc2\x94 Saying this, Vasudeva took up that child in his arms\nand began to look amorously at the face of that child of wonderful deeds.\n\n\n\n24\\. Thus looking, Vasudeva thought \xc2\x93What can I do now so as to relieve me\nfrom my sorrows owing to the future destruction of this child.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n25-27. While Vasudeva was thus anxiously pondering over, the Heaven Voice\nclearly said thus :-- \xc2\x93O Vasudeva! Quickly go to Gokula with the child. The\nkeepers and guards I have made dead asleep by My Maya. The eight very strong\ndoors are now lying wide open. You better free yourself from your chains and\ntake this child, keep it in the house of Nanda and bring Yoga Maya from there\nand come back here.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n28-29. Thus hearing the Heavenly Voice, he cast his glance at the doors and\nfound them all wide open. O King! Very quickly then he took the child and\nstepped out of the prison, quite unnoticed by the guards and watchmen. Going\nto the banks of the Jumna he found there the daughter of Kalindi, flowing with\ngreat force and became anxious.\n\n\n\n30-31. But the river Jumna instantaneously turned out to be easily fordable\njust knee deep; then Vasudeva, guided by Yoga Maya, crossed the Jumna and\nbetaking to an unfrequented road arrived at Gokul at dead of night. There, at\nthe doorway of the house of Nanda, he began to see the cows, buffaloes, the\nwealth and property of Nanda.\n\n\n\n32\\. At that very moment, there was born of Yos\xc2\x92oda, the Maha Devi, the part\nof the Divine Yoga Maya, the Incarnate of the three qualities.\n\n\n\n33\\. Then the Mahadevi Yoga Maya, assuming the appearance of a female artisan,\ntaking that divine female child in her arms came there and handed her over to\nVasudeva.\n\n\n\n34\\. Vasudeva, too, delivered his child over to the lotus like hands of the\nDevi and, taking the female child instead, quickly returned with his heart\nfull of joy.\n\n\n\n35\\. He went unto the prison and kept that female child in the bed of Devaki\nand remained aside, fearful and anxious.\n\n\n\n36-37. But that child, the moment she was lulled to sleep, began to cry in a\nsonorous voice; the royal guards at once woke up on that cry, and being\nbewildered with fear, hurriedly went to their king and said \xc2\x93O King! Come\nquickly. Devaki has brought forth a child.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n38-39. The King of the Bhojas, hearing their words, went there quickly and saw\nthe doors open, called on Vasudeva \xc2\x93O blessed one! Let me have the eighth son\nof Devaki, my death incarnate; I will at once kill that enemy of mine, born as\npart incarnate of Hari.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 340\n\n\n\n40\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing Kamsa\xc2\x92s words, Vasudeva handed over to him\nthe female child crying and very much bewildered with fear.\n\n\n\n41\\. At the sight of the female child, the king was very much astonished and\nbegan to think that the Heavenly Voice and the Seer Narada\xc2\x92s words turned out\nfalse.\n\n\n\n42\\. How can Vasudeva be able to bring about, in this dreadful place, the\nunnatural act of turning male into a female. Especially my guards are\ncarefully watching the place. There is no doubt in this.\n\n\n\n43\\. How has this female child come here? Where has that eighth born child\ngone? I ought not to doubt in this matter. For the ways of Time are\nmysterious!\n\n\n\n44-46. Thinking thus, the cruel King Kamsa caught hold of that female child by\nher legs and, raising her high up in the air, was going to strike her against\na stone, when the female child slipped out of his hands and flying into the\nair assumed a divine appearance and gently spoke to Kamsa, thus :-- \xc2\x93What will\nyou get by killing me? Your powerful enemy is already born on the earth. O\nvilest of men! Disgrace to your family! He, the Excellent Human being Who is\nvery difficult to be worshiped will certainly kill you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n47-49. Saying thus, the auspicious female child, able to go anywhere according\nto her will, disappeared. Kamsa astonished returned to his own home and,\nbecoming impatient with fear and anger, called all the Danavas Baka, Dhenuka,\nVatsa and others, and addressed them thus :-- \xc2\x93O Danavas. Go all of you to\nserve my purpose. Kill anywhere the child whom you see just born.\n\n\n\n50\\. Let Putana, expert in killing children go today to Nanda\xc2\x92s Gokula. My\norder is this :-- Any child recently born they must kill.\n\n\n\n51\\. Dhenuka, Vatsaka, Kes\xc2\x92i, Pralamba, and Vaka, etc., all should remain in\nGokula to carry out my order.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n52\\. The cruel king Kamsa, thus ordering the Demons, went away to his own\npalace, and, thinking on this matter over and over again became, very much\nafflicted with fear and his mind got immensely depressed.\n\n\n\nThus ends the 23rd Chapter in the 4th Skandha of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the\nMaha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa, on the birth of\nS\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 24](bk04ch24.htm)\n\n'
