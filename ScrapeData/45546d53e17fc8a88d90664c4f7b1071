And (knowledge belongs) to those who are bound to chastity; for in\nscripture (that condition of life is mentioned).\n\nScripture shows that knowledge is valid also for those stages of life for\nwhich chastity is prescribed. Now in their case knowledge cannot be\nsubordinate to work because work is absent; for the works prescribed by the\nVeda such as the Agnihotra are no longer performed by men who have reached\nthose stages.--But, an objection is raised, those stages of life are not even\nmentioned in the Veda!--This is not so, we reply. Certain Vedic passages\nclearly intimate them; so e.g. 'There are three branches of the law' ( _Kh_.\nUp. II, 23, 1); 'Those who in the forest practise faith and austerity' ( _Kh_.\nUp. V, 10, 1); 'Those who practise penance and faith in the forest' (Mu. Up.\nI, 10, 11); 'Wishing for that world only mendicants wander forth' (B _ri_. Up.\nIV, 4, 22); 'Let him wander forth at once from the state of studentship.'--\nThat the stages requiring chastity are open to men whether they have reached\nhouseholdership or not, and whether they have paid the debts (of procreating a\nson, &c.) or not, is known from scripture and Sm _ri_ ti. Herefrom also\nfollows the independence of knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 18](sbe38227.htm)\n\n"
