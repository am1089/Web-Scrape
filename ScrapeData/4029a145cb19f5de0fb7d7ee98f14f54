III.\n\nMeasure of time. Moments or Kasht\xcc\x81has, &c.; day and night; fortnight, month,\nyear, divine year: Yugas, or ages: Mahayuga, or great age: day of Brahma:\nperiods of the Manus: a Manwantara: night of Brahma, and destruction of the\nworld: a year of Brahma: his life: a Kalpa: a Pararrdha: the past, or Padma\nKalpa: the present, or Varaha.\n\nMAITREYA.--How can creative agency be attributed to that Brahma, who is\nwithout qualities, illimitable, pure, and free from imperfection?\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--The essential properties of existent things are objects of\nobservation, of which no foreknowledge is attainable; and creation, and\nhundreds of properties, belong to Brahma, as inseparable parts of his essence,\nas heat, oh chief of sages, is inherent in fire 1. Hear then how\n\np. 22\n\nthe deity Narayana, in the person of Brahma, the great parent of the world,\ncreated all existent things.\n\nBrahma is said to be born: a familiar phrase, to signify his manifestation;\nand, as the peculiar measure of his presence, a hundred of his years is said\nto constitute his life: that period is also called Param, and the half of it,\nPararddham 2. I have already declared to you, oh sinless Brahman, that Time is\na form of Vishn\xcc\x81u: hear now how it is applied to measure the duration of\nBrahma, and of all other sentient beings, as well as of those which are\nunconscious, as the mountains, oceans, and the like.\n\nOh best of sages, fifteen twinklings of the eye make a Kasht\xcc\x81ha; thirty\nKasht\xcc\x81has, one Kala; and thirty Kalas, one Muhurtta 3. Thirty Muhurttas\n\np. 23\n\nconstitute a day and night of mortals: thirty such days make a month, divided\ninto two half-months: six months form an Ayana (the period of the sun\'s\nprogress north or south of the ecliptic): and two Ayanas compose a year. The\nsouthern Ayana is a night, and the northern a day of the gods. Twelve thousand\ndivine years, each composed of (three hundred and sixty) such days, constitute\nthe period of the four Yugas, or ages. They are thus distributed: the Krita\nage has four thousand divine years; the Treta three thousand; the Dwapara two\nthousand; and the Kali age one thousand: so those acquainted with antiquity\nhave declared. The period that precedes a Yuga is called a Sandhya, and it is\nof as many hundred years as there are thousands in the Yuga: and the period\nthat follows a Yuga, termed the Sandhyansa, is of similar duration. The\ninterval between the Sandhya and the Sandhyansa is the Yuga, denominated\nKrita, Treta, &c. The Krita, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali, constitute a great age,\nor aggregate of four ages: a thousand such aggregates are a day of Brahma, and\nfourteen Menus reign within that term. Hear the division of time which they\nmeasure 4.\n\np. 24\n\nSeven Rishis, certain (secondary) divinities, Indra, Manu, and the kings his\nsons, are created and perish at one period 5; and the interval, called a\nManwantara, is equal to seventy-one times the number of years contained in the\nfour Yugas, with some additional years: this is the duration of the Manu, the\n(attendant) divinities, and the rest, which is equal to 852.000 divine years,\nor to 306.720.000 years of mortals, independent of the additional period 6.\nFourteen times this period constitutes\n\np. 25\n\na Brahma day, that is, a day of Brahma; the term (Brahma) being the derivative\nform. At the end of this day a dissolution of the universe occurs, when all\nthe three worlds, earth, and the regions of space, are consumed with fire. The\ndwellers of Maharloka (the region inhabited by the saints who survive the\nworld), distressed by the heat, repair then to Janaloka (the region of holy\nmen after their decease). When the-three worlds are but one mighty ocean,\nBrahma, who is one with Narayan\xcc\x81a, satiate with the demolition of the\nuniverse, sleeps upon his serpent-bed--contemplated, the lotus born, by the\nascetic inhabitants of the Janaloka--for a night of equal duration with his\nday; at the close of which he creates anew. Of such days and nights is a year\nof Brahma composed; and a hundred such years constitute his whole life 7. One\nPararddha 8, or half his existence, has expired, terminating with the Maha\nKalpa 9 called Padma. The Kalpa (or day of Brahma) termed Varaha is the first\nof the second period of Brahma\'s existence.\n\np. 26\n\nthis page consists entire of footnotes\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[21:1](vp037.htm#fr_150) Agency depends upon the Raja guna, the quality of\nfoulness or passion, which is an imperfection. Perfect being is void of all\nqualities, and is therefore inert:\n\nOmnis enim per se divom natura necesse est  \nImmortali aevo summa cum pace fruatur:\n\nbut if inert for ever, creation could not occur. The objection is rather\nevaded than answered. The ascribing to Brahma of innumerable and unappreciable\nproperties is supported by the commentator with vague and scarcely applicable\ntexts of the Vedas. \'In him there is neither instrument nor effect: his like,\nhis superior, is nowhere seen.\' \'That supreme soul is the subjugator of all,\nthe ruler of all, the sovereign of all.\' In various places of the Vedas also\nit is said that his power is supreme, and that wisdom, power, and action are\nhis essential properties. The origin of creation is also imputed in the Vedas\nto the rise of will or desire in the Supreme: \'He wished I may become\nmanifold, I may create creatures.\' The Bhagavata expresses the same doctrine:\n\'The Supreme Being was before all things alone, the soul and lord of spiritual\nsubstance: in consequence of his own will he is secondarily defined, as if of\nvarious minds.\' This will however, in the mysticism of the Bhagavata, is\npersonified as Maya: \'She (that desire) was the energy of the Supreme, who was\ncontemplating (the untreated world); and by her, whose name is Maya, the Lord\nmade the universe.\' This, which was at first a mere poetical personification\nof the divine will, came, in such works as the Bhagavata, to denote a female\ndivinity, coequal and coeternal with the First Cause. It may be doubted if the\nVedas authorize such a mystification, and no very decided vestige of it occurs\nin the Vishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\n[22:2](vp037.htm#fr_151) This term is also applied to a different and still\nmore protracted period. See b. VI. C. 3.\n\n[22:3](vp037.htm#fr_152) The last proportion is rather obscurely expressed:\n\'Thirty of them (Kalas) are the rule for the Muhurtta.\' The commentator says\nit means that thirty Kalas make a Ghatika (or Ghari), and two Ghatikas a\nMuhurtta; but his explanation is gratuitous, and is at variance with more\nexplicit passages elsewhere; as in the Matsya: \'A Muhurtta is thirty Kalas.\'\nIn these divisions of the twenty-four hours the Kurma, Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, Matsya,\nVayu, and Linga Puran\xcc\x81as exactly agree with our authority. In Manu, I. 64, we\nhave the same computation, with a difference in the first article, eighteen\nNimeshas being one Kasht\xcc\x81ha. The Bhavishya P. follows Manu in that respect,\nand agrees in the rest with the Padma, which has,\n\n15 Nimeshas\n\n|\n\n= 1 Kasht\xcc\x81ha  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n30 Kasht\xcc\x81has\n\n|\n\n= 1 Kala  \n  \n30 Kalas\n\n|\n\n= 1 Kshan\xcc\x81a  \n  \n12 Kshan\xcc\x81as\n\n|\n\n=1 Muhurtta  \n  \n30 Muhurttas\n\n|\n\n= 1 day and night.  \n  \nIn the Mahabharata, Moksha Dherma, it is said that thirty Kalas and one-tenth,\nor, according to the commentator, thirty Kalas and three Kasht\xcc\x81has, make a\nMuhurtta. A still greater variety, however, occurs in the Bhagavata and in the\nBrahma Vaivartta P. These have,\n\n2\n\n|\n\nParaman\xcc\x81us\n\n|\n\n= 1 An\xcc\x81u  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n3\n\n|\n\nAn\xcc\x81us\n\n|\n\n= 1 Trasaren\xcc\x81u  \n  \n3\n\n|\n\nTrasaren\xcc\x81us\n\n|\n\n= 1 Truti  \n  \n100\n\n|\n\nTrutis\n\n|\n\n= 1 Vedha  \n  \n3\n\n|\n\nVedhas\n\n|\n\n= 1 Lava  \n  \n3\n\n|\n\nLavas\n\n|\n\n= 1 Nimesha  \n  \n3\n\n|\n\nNimeshas\n\n|\n\n= 1 Kshan\xcc\x81a  \n  \n5\n\n|\n\nKshan\xcc\x81as\n\n|\n\n= 1 Kasht\xcc\x81ha  \n  \n15\n\n|\n\nKasht\xcc\x81has\n\n|\n\n= 1 Laghu  \n  \n15\n\n|\n\nLaghus\n\n|\n\n= 1 Narika  \n  \n2\n\n|\n\nNarikas\n\n|\n\n= 1 Muhurtta  \n  \n6 or 7\n\n|\n\nNarikas\n\n|\n\n= 1 Yama, or watch of the day or night.  \n  \nAllusions to this or either of the preceding computations, or to any other,\nhave not been found in either of the other Puran\xcc\x81as: p. 23 yet the work of\nGopala Bhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a, from which Mr. Colebrooke states he derived his information\non the subject of Indian weights and measures (A. R. 5. 105), the Sankhya\nPariman\xcc\x81a, cites the Varaha P. for a peculiar computation, and quotes another\nfrom the Bhavishya, different from that which occurs in the first chapter of\nthat work, to which we have referred. The principle of the calculation adopted\nby the astronomical works is different: it is, 6 respirations (Pran\xcc\x81a) = 1\nVikala; 60 Vikalas = 1 Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a; 60 Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as =1 sydereal day. The Nimesha,\nwhich is the base of one of the Pauran\xcc\x81ic modes, is a twinkle of the eye of a\nman at rest; whilst the Paraman\xcc\x81u, which is the origin of the other, and\napparently more modern system, considering the works in which it occurs, is\nthe time taken by a Paraman\xcc\x81u, or mote in the sunbeam, to pass through a\ncrevice in a shutter. Some indications of this calculation being in common\ncurrency, occur in the Hindustani terms Ren\xcc\x81u (Trasaren\xcc\x81u) and Lamhu (Laghu)\nin Indian horometry (A. R. 5. 81); whilst the more ordinary system seems\nderived from the astronomical works, being 60 Tilas = 1 Vipala; 60 Vipalas = 1\nPala; 60 Palas = 1 Dan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a or Ghari. _Ibid_.\n\n[23:4](vp037.htm#fr_153) These calculations of time are found in most of the\nPuran\xcc\x81as, with some additions occasionally, of no importance, as that of the\nyear of the seven Rishis, 3030 mortal years, and the year of Dhruva, 9090 such\nyears, in the Linga P. In all essential points the computations accord, and\nthe scheme, extravagant as it may appear, seems to admit of easy explanation.\nWe have, in the first place, a computation of the years of the gods in the\nfour ages, or, p. 24\n\nKrita\n\n|\n\nYuga\n\n|\n\n4000\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nSandhya\n\n|\n\n400\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nSandhyansa\n\n|\n\n_400_\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n4800\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nTreta\n\n|\n\nYuga\n\n|\n\n3000\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nSandhya\n\n|\n\n300\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nSandhyansa\n\n|\n\n_300_\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n3600\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nDwapara\n\n|\n\nYuga\n\n|\n\n2000\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nSandhya\n\n|\n\n200\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nSandhyansa\n\n|\n\n_200_\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n2400\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nKali\n\n|\n\nYuga\n\n|\n\n1000\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nSandhya\n\n|\n\n100\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\nSandhyansa\n\n|\n\n_100_\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n_1200_\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n12000.  \n  \n[paragraph continues] If these divine years are converted into years of\nmortals, by multiplying them by 360, a year of men being a day of the gods, we\nobtain the years of which the Yugas of mortals are respectively said to\nconsist:\n\n4800 x 360\n\n|\n\n= 1.728.000  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n3600 x 360\n\n|\n\n= 1.296.000  \n  \n2400 x 360\n\n|\n\n= 864.000  \n  \n1200 x 360\n\n|\n\n= _432.000_  \n  \n\n\n|\n\n4.320.000 a Mahayuga.  \n  \n[paragraph continues] So that these periods resolve themselves into very\nsimple elements: the notion of four ages in a deteriorating series expressed\nby descending arithmetical progression, as 4, 3, 2, 5; the conversion of units\ninto thousands; and the mythological fiction, that these were divine years,\neach composed of 360 years of men. It does not seem necessary to refer the\ninvention to any astronomical computations, or to any attempt to represent\nactual chronology.\n\n[24:5](vp037.htm#fr_154) The details of these, as occurring in each\nManwantara, are given in the third book, c. 1 and 2.\n\n[24:6](vp037.htm#fr_155) \'One and seventy enumerations of the four ages, with\na surplus.\' A similar reading occurs in several other Puran\xcc\x81as, but none of\nthem state of what the surplus or addition consists; but it is, in fact, the\nnumber of years required to reconcile two computations of the Kalpa. The most\nsimple, and probably the original calculation of a Kalpa, is its being 1000\ngreat ages, or ages of the gods: ### Bhavishya P. Then 4.320.000 years, or a\ndivine age, x 1000 = 4320.000.000 years, or a day or night of Brahma,. But a\nday of Brahma is also seventy-one times a great age multiplied by fourteen:\n4.320.000 x 71 x 14= 4.294.080.000, or less than the preceding by 25.920.000;\nand it is to make up for this deficiency that a certain number of years must\nbe added to the computation by Manwantaras. According to the Surya Siddhanta,\nas cited by Mr. Davis (A. R. 2. 231), this addition consists of a Sandhi to\neach Manwantara, equal to the Satya age, or 5.728.000 years; and one similar\nSandhi at the commencement of the Kalpa: thus p. 25 4.320.000 x 71 =\n306.720.000 + 1.728.000 = 308.448.000 x 14 = 4318.272.000 + 1.728.000 =\n4320.000.000. The Pauranics, however, omit the Sandhi of the Kalpa, and add\nthe whole compensation to the Manwantaras. The amount of this in whole numbers\nis 1.851.428 in each Manwantara, or 4.320.000 x 71= 306.720.000 + 1.851.428 =\n308.571.428 x 14 = 4319.999.992; leaving a very small inferiority to the\nresult of the calculation of a Kalpa by a thousand great ages. To provide for\nthis deficiency, indeed, very minute subdivisions are admitted into the\ncalculation; and the commentator on our text says, that the additional years,\nif of gods, are 5142 years, 10 months, 8 days, 4 watches, 2 Muhurttas, 8\nKalas, 17 Kasht\xcc\x81has, 2 Nimeshas, and 1/7th; if of mortals, 1.851.428 years, 6\nmonths, 24 days, 12 Naris, 12 Kalas, 25 Kasht\xcc\x81has, and 10 Nimeshas. It will be\nobserved, that in the Kalpa we have the regular descending series 4, 3, 2,\nwith cyphers multiplied ad libitum.\n\n[25:7](vp037.htm#fr_156) The Brahma Vaivartta says 108 years, but this is\nunusual. Brahma\'s life is but a Nimesha of Krishn\xcc\x81a, according to that work; a\nNimesha of \xc5\x9aiva, according to the Saiva Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\n[25:8](vp037.htm#fr_157) In the last book the Pararddha occurs as a very\ndifferent measure of time, but it is employed here in its ordinary\nacceptation.\n\n[25:9](vp037.htm#fr_158) In theory the Kalpas are infinite; as the Bhavishya:\n\'Excellent sages, thousands of millions of Kalpas have passed, and as many are\nto come.\' In the Linga Puran\xcc\x81a, and others of the Saiva division, above thirty\nKalpas are named, and some account given of several, but they are evidently\nsectarial embellishments. The only Kalpas usually specified are those which\nfollow in the text: the one which was the last, or the Padma, and the present\np. 26 or Varaha. The first is also commonly called the Brahma; but the\nBhagavata distinguishes the Brahma, considering it to be the first of Brahma\'s\nlife, whilst the Padma was the last of the first Pararddha. The terms Mana, or\ngreat Kalpa, applied to the Padma, is attached to it only in a general sense;\nor, according to the commentator, because it comprises, as a minor Kalpa, that\nin which Brahma was born from a lotus. Properly, a great Kalpa is not a day,\nbut a life of Brahma; as in the Brahma Vaivartta: \'Chronologers compute a\nKalpa by the life of Brahma. Minor Kalpas, as Samvartta and the rest, are\nnumerous.\' Minor Kalpas here denote every period of destruction, or those in\nwhich the Samvartta wind, or other destructive agents, operate. Several other\ncomputations of time are found in different Puran\xcc\x81as, but it will be\nsufficient to notice one which occurs in the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, as it is peculiar,\nand because it is not quite correctly given in M. Langlois\' translation. It is\nthe calculation of the Manava time, or time of a Menu.\n\n10\n\n|\n\ndivine years\n\n|\n\n= a day and night of a Menu.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n10\n\n|\n\nManava days\n\n|\n\n= his fortnight.  \n  \n10\n\n|\n\nManava fortn.\n\n|\n\n= his month.  \n  \n12\n\n|\n\nManava months\n\n|\n\n= his season.  \n  \n6\n\n|\n\nManava seasons\n\n|\n\n= his year.  \n  \nAccordingly the commentator says 72000 divine years make up his year. The\nFrench translation has, "dix annees des dieux font un jour de Menu; dix jours\ndes dieux font un pakcha de Menu," &c. The error lies in the expression "jours\n_des dieux_ ," and is evidently a mere inadvertence; for if ten _years_ make a\n_day_ , ten _days_ can scarcely make a _fortnight_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IV](vp038.htm)\n\n'
