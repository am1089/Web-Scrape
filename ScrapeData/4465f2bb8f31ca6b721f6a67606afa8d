Reading and\nreading, reading, some reading yet he cannot read so as to discern the great\nsecret.\n\n401\n\nWho are those we everywhere term wife and husband. If thou will (take the\ntrouble to) carefully view them, the truth is evident; but no one can see the\njoints of puppets (lit. skin images).\n\n402\n\nTake cow's butter and boil it well, mingle vegetables with it (branchless\nfruits). It is tasteless. The noblest of tastes is that of beatitude.\n\n403\n\nWhen we are born in the womb of our mother, at first, we had not clothing, nor\nshall have it at our latter end. Is not it then a joke for us to wear clothing\nin our intermediate life?\n\np. 104\n\n404\n\nLike as a dog while hunting for bran that falls in with a heap of rice seizes\nit; thus does the wealth of the merchant fall to the lot of the hard and the\ncruel,\n\n405\n\nThe _Vaishnavites_ are saws in the assembly of kings (causing dissension).\nThese are the chief gamblers of gamblers. They know not counsel but are swift\nin their eagerness for wealth.\n\n406\n\nThe vile, leaves the man of worth and lauds the vile? Every man praises those\nwho resemble him (asinus asinum fricat). Can a block give sense to a beam?\n\n407\n\nWhy should a pearled tire (papita) be given to shaven widow instead of to a\nwife possessed of all charms? Why should a lame horse have a tasselled saddle.\n\n408\n\nThose men in the world who are faithful ( _satya_ ) they shall also obtain\nwisdom worthily. When faith and wisdom are expired, a man becomes a Brahmin,\ntwice born. What hath he who has attained to do with learning. (The poet\nevidently had a double meaning, sneering at Brahmins.)\n\np. 105\n\n409\n\nTaking fire in their hands yet scoffiing at God, the Brahmins have become\n[debased](errata.htm#67); wandering in many diverse paths, all the Brahmins\nare ruined.\n\n410\n\nThe leaf platters of Brahmins are the share of dogs of the street and the\nplatters of [pariahs](errata.htm#68) alone are honoured. The platters thus\nhonoured become the share of Brahmins.\n\n411\n\nA Brahmin will eat bone-food in which pounded skeleton is mingled. A married\nwoman becomes a p\xc4\x93rat\xc4\x81lu. [These](errata.htm#69) give up their caste and\ncharacter through excess of avarice.\n\n412\n\nWhat sort of caste is theirs who swallow the bearings of those demon--gods\nthat devour palmwine and flesh. Thou with faith worship Siva they fail of\nbecoming happiness.\n\n413\n\nThou in the great destruction (the _pralaya_ ) all men were destroyed by the\nservants (pramatha) of Siva, yet have the Brahmins become enable to comprehend\nthis.\n\np. 107\n\n414\n\nThe Vishnava sect is mere talk. There are no others more fallen than these\nwretches. Shall beatitude be attained by any sinner? (lit. by all hard men).\n\n415\n\nBy birth a soodra--how can he become perfect ([the](errata.htm#70) best of the\ngood)? The soodra state to a woman in every [respect](errata.htm#71)\\--his\nmother being a soodra how is he a Brahmin?\n\n416\n\nWhose son in this world is Brahma? If thou enquire whose son is Vishnu; if\nthou plainly enquire whose son is Siva? Men are ignorant of shame who dare\ncall these persons gods.\n\n417\n\nThe mother of the (setti) washerman caste washes menstrous garments, their\nfather, great as he carries about grain. What is the pomp of these sons of\nasses?\n\n418\n\nRambha, the celestial dancer seized the _Somayaji_ (scorned him) and disgraced\nhim, she covets with the somayaji, casting him down. Thus was it that this\nfellow gained the fruit of his sacrifices.\n\np. 107\n\n419\n\nA man may get the title of dasari if merely has the fancy. He may be called\njangam if he will give up a regular life. But he cannot be called Brahmin by\nany means.\n\n420\n\nYou let your son eat off the same plate of whatever he be a son, you swallow\nhis leavings--you cannot even see the least of true knowledge.\n\n421\n\nThe _comatees_ fall down at the gate of him that gives interest--he suffers\nthe pains of hell. They will give you a penny or a farthing but nothing\nrespectable.\n\n422\n\nBrahmins go on calling food and water defiled and throw them away ignorant of\ntheir nature. Food and drink are in truth Hari, Ha: a and Brahma indefilable\nby touch. They defile him alone who calls them defiled.\n\n423\n\nFirst by plunging in water Brahmin loses sight; by roaming he gains nothing\nbut giddiness, by howling out the Vedas he turns into a dog.\n\np. 108\n\n424\n\nIf we take no food, the fire within the belly feeds on its own impurity. Then\nhow shall he become pure who fasts and thus devours foulness.\n\n425\n\nOne may wear a _longoti_ , and wish to have himself a mini but cannot cease\nfrom the cupidity of his heart; the semblance indeed is one way and the heart\notherwise.\n\n426\n\nHe who seeing men dying and who knoweth the divine nature as removed equally\nfrom the death and birth, who thinketh deeply in his mind and gazette in\nabstraction he shall attain beatitude.\n\n427\n\nLike when a frog when beholdeth a snake that snake swalloweth the frog with\ngreat eagerness. Thus is the soul absorbed in worldly pursuits--who can\nextricate the frog? Vemana knoweth how to free it--are thou involved in\nworldly pursuits? This book shall release thee.\n\n428\n\np. 109\n\nThe verses of Vemana well considered admit of [a thousand](errata.htm#72)\ninterpretations. If thou think on these, this shall produce refined wisdom in\nthee.\n\n429\n\nLet us look upon the fair assemblage of eighty four lakhs of animals as\nclearly the sons of Brahma; if thou attain wisdom thou hast the divinity.\n\n430\n\nThe offspring of a multitude of all things and of all bodies and the five\nelements are born in this world. Those who fill their bellies with these\ncannot discern truth.\n\n431\n\nThere being five joints (i.e., shoulders, thighs and neck) this car of the\nbody goes about the world. If one joint be loosed that splendid car is ruined.\n\n432\n\nQuit the two weaknesses--hunger and thirst, the two of age and death, the two\nof pain and love, the two of pleasure and grief and the two of wisdom and\nignorance. There is but one deity (in account) placed above the two mansions\nof the breast and forehead. Thus shall the gifted sage be happy gazing into\nhis earthen vessel. (The signification of such riddles depends pp the fancy of\nthe interpreter.)\n\np. 110\n\n433\n\nHe that knoweth the sunrising and knows the course of the sun and who knows\nthe sunset in its beauty--He that thus knows the sun, he is a part of the\ndivinity.\n\n434\n\nAs long as the body lasts we must alternately sink and rise in contemplation\nregarding the _shacti_ or creative power. When her protection leaves us we\nbegin to wish for it not before.\n\n435\n\nCasting out from the ship the seven _dhatus_ , five _pranas_ , six passions,\neight (5 bhootas and 3 gunas) and one delusion, the king mounts the vessel and\ngoes about. This is tatwa.\n\n436\n\nFairly establishing the house built on one [pillar](errata.htm#73) with its\nsix stores, how shall one make himself lord of that mansion.\n\n437\n\nTo be united with six [passions](errata.htm#74), grief at the last; to be\nunited with the seven becometh a cause of weeping. To slay in unison of these\n(for these to perish) is wisdom.\n\np. 111\n\n438\n\nRelinquish the three affections, confuse the three, sink the three qualities,\n_gunas_ , the three Gods and the three _shareerams_. The combination of the\nthree, three and three form beatitude.\n\n439\n\nBelieving the external world to be the divinity they scrutinise it. How should\nthe external world (ed quod externumeast) of itself become divinity? Felicity\nexists in scrutinising that firmament within us that is the divinity.\n\n440\n\nSurely those are mad who, while there is one chief quality (satvika) in the\nthree ( _rajasa_ , _tamasa_ and _satvika_ ) leave it, unite the three, place\nthem in their heart and unable to discern it are plunged in worldly pursuits.\n\n441\n\nBetween the Ganga and the Yamuna (i.e., the two nostrils) there is a maid\n(spine) like a golden image, If thou unite thyself to her in love (i.e.,\nmeditation) without fail hereby shalt thou attain beatitude.\n\n442\n\np. 112\n\nFew millions of goats died; only did one monkey mount on a leaf when ten\nmillions of those monkeys died, a fox cried co, co--This riddle signifies.\n\nAja\n\n|\n\na goat\n\n|\n\nAja like wise means Brahma  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nHari\n\n|\n\na monkey,\n\n|\n\nHari also means Vishnu  \n  \nSiva\n\n|\n\na fox,\n\n|\n\nSiva is Shiva who ultimately survives triumpth.  \n  \n443\n\nThe tree of the back-bone is fixed on the fruit of its lower extremity and the\nwires of nerves are fixed. The fingers on those wires perform the (tripura\ntandava) dance of Siva in Tripura.\n\n444\n\nA cock touching sky and earth having horns protrude their points--splendour\nwithout a lamp shall shine.\n\n445\n\nAt first it is a tree; at last it is not a bird; it has no mouth, but six\nfruits; it his not even one life and slays living creatures.\n\n446\n\nIt hath no foot nor hand; but has a petticoat; no horn but rushes swiftly and\nbites at all men Without having practiced in a fencing school it slays us.\nThis is a great marvel.\n\np. 113\n\n447\n\nHe that has an external throat with his mouth feeds on leaves; he has one leg\nand is all to match he shines and talks in the courts of kings.\n\n448\n\nWhen acquainted with the path of great [construction](errata.htm#75) of the\nbody (acunchana) if at any time thou disregard the _moola bandhana_ all the\nold men in the world shall become youths. (This mystic fooling signifies that\nwhat is apparently the meanest is of the first consequence)\n\n449\n\nIf fixing thy understanding thou look and behold the light of the moon (i.e..\nbreast)...([incomplete](errata.htm#76)).\n\n450\n\n_Maya_ is not in fact the daughter in-law. She is the wife of all men in the\nworld. Behold, she is gold, but such as cannot be plundered (nonsense, useful\nfor words).\n\n451\n\nBrahma became a horse Siva (Bhava) became the saddle; _Adi_ Vishnu became the\nstirrup. He that mounts on this stud is either [female](errata.htm#77) or\nmale. I know not which.\n\np. 114\n\n452\n\nThe men subject to passions, on one side serpents (passions-- _indriya_ ),\ncrows on one side, the nine large tomcats (animal senses) on one side; the\nnine large paths, being restrained, the light (the soul) departed to the\nexternal, the tiger (ignorance), the fox (delusion) rose up and gazed; the dog\n(mind) perished--the men of the woods ([apes](errata.htm#78)) cried out, the\nsoul has become Him, Him.\n\n453\n\nMeddle not with the (yoga) eight connections of the body, the six creeds or\nthe three causes ( _mantra_ , _laya_ , _hatha_ ). By the one remaining means\n(i.e., pure devotion) thou shalt attain happiness.\n\n454\n\nThe spirit that is named without equal, having slain the being that formerly\nbore his name, and again caused him to return into life, Vemana can render his\nimage (or brother) stable for ever. (Mystic raving)\n\np. 115\n\n455\n\nWhat wonder is it that the tree of wisdom should grow with its root upwards\n(in heaven) and its point downwards (in earth); over its root is a lustful\nelephant (the eye) walking. What is the wonder of this? Like a distinguished\nsoldier, an elephant (ignorance) swallow an ant (wisdom), what the secret of a\nmarvellous tree (the Sushumna n\xc4\x81dam) that never was born, being produced in\nthe earth, on (the body) a rock and if the _chemanti_ flower (chrysanthemum\nIndicum) the mudricas be produced, what is the secret of the birth? Behold if\nthe all knowing and learned men speak distinctly, Vema listen to them.\n\n456\n\nIn the earth a frog (the mind) seized five serpents (passions) and suddenly\nswallowed them. What is this? Two\n\np. 116\n\nmen of the woods (apes i.e., wisdom and ignorance) came and by themselves of\nthemselves swallowed their young (their acts i.e., annihilated them), to a fox\n(delusion) in the Iron age _c \xc4\x81madhenu_ was born. In what way was this?\nPossessing intellect there was an infant that chewed; what was this marvel\n(wisdom absorbing ignorance). In seven modes of existence, (mahattu, ahankara,\nshabda, sparsha, roopa, rasa, gandham) mercilessly was might (delusion)\nproduced and agitated men. What is this? The all knowing sages that have\ndeclared this, listen to them O Vema.\n\n457\n\nWhat is the mystery of a fly that screamed out and swallowed a bed? How was a\nmace produced in jasmine blossoms? Amazing, on a (marri)neem tree (ignorance)\n[plantain](errata.htm#79) fruits (wisdom) were produced; how was this? What is\nthat dancing that the flower bodied woman knows. How did the five coloured\nparrots have power to swallow five mountains. Thus have the wise of old\ntaught, listen O Vema.\n\n458\n\np. 117\n\nHe who comprehends the [preceding](errata.htm#80) three verses and can explain\nthem truly he shall see Siva. What is there unknown to thee?\n\n459\n\nHe who knows one, two, three and four, five, six, seven, eight, nine thus far,\nto the last what these are, that man is Vemana.\n\n460\n\nIf they [do](errata.htm#81) not [hesitate](errata.htm#82) in 1006 ways water\ncourses well turn as men turn. But a thousand ways are insufficient to teach\nthe chief (root) wisdom to a piece of wood.\n\n461\n\nWhile impurities are perpetually flowing from the orifices of his body, how is\nit said that the recluse is thoroughly pure? O ye sheep who externally daub\nyourselves and fall into the hands of Fate!\n\n462\n\nIn the eye flowing from [moisture](errata.htm#83), in a boil flowing with\nmatter, in a house the thatch of which is damaged, in a whirlwind,\n\np. 118\n\nin the breast that the child sucks--how should there be any tightness?\n\n463\n\nIf you say let us look behind, there is the well of (foulness) dirt. If you\nsay let us look before, there is a nasty pit. Oh when they see a woman men\nfell down to pray her.\n\n464\n\nIf fate (the female power) look at men they hide their faces. Unless ye eat\nthe food of that Fate ye shall not be blest That power (fate) is the origin of\nthe three Gods.\n\n465\n\nA girl is smart powder; but divinity is grain flour. The future state, in its\nexcellence is fine _calama_ flour. Can sages know the excellence of such\nflour.\n\n466\n\nIf you say I will drink palm wine they abuse you violently; they abuse the\nentire body of him who drinks it. Yet he who drinks palm wine they entitle\nnoble, for the recluse knows not the distinctions of good and evil.\n\n467\n\np. 119\n\nThe village of our body in which the deity dwells is Hill Town (the head); his\nis in back street (the spine). There in silence is the first house. We gaze\nand continually view it, this is the road of beatitude.\n\n468\n\nQuitting the bonds of the body he cannot go forth. Sargnee (Vishnu) walketh\nwith delusion as, with his wife. If he, so mighty, is thus ensnared, what\npower had men to release themselves?\n\n469\n\nIn Gandic\xc5\x8dta there is a musk deer; it is not a great horseman. Be he great as\nhe may be, that deer will mount (the hill) and overthrow him.\n\n470\n\nP\xc4\x81can\xc4\x81ti Reddee, and M\xc5\x8dtah Reddee and T\xc5\x8dta Pedda Yerra Reddee, these are all\nstubborn, wretches accomplished in all hardness. Thus have they gained\ncelebrity.\n\n471\n\nAre all those creatures men who bear about sedan? He alone who enjoys himself\nwithin it is He (the God); shall the fruits of his good deeds be enjoyed by\nthese base wretches?\n\np. 120\n\n472\n\nThe accomplished sages all meet and forming the mental figure, purified it\nwith lime of steel--surely then lime is not the source of all purity.\n\n473\n\nHe who eats lime (of stone or shells) possesses the philosopher's stone,\nchunam that exceeds in the touch [of](errata.htm#84) gold, is better to Brahma\nand the rest.\n\n474\n\nLime is the best of all matters. Lime displays the present world in the earth\nand it also shows us heaven.\n\n475\n\nHe who eats lime will be delivered from the ties of relationship which shall\nall be calcined; can it remain permanent? (lit. in the path) To Vishnu, Siva\nand Brahma never have any power over lime.\n\n476\n\nBy eating it have the demigods and _munees_ attained immortality. But they who\nsee and scorn it derive then beauty from it. When men eat it they become\ndemigods.\n\np. 121\n\n477\n\nIs not the horse noble? Is not it all things? Cannot we attain Siva? If we\nmeditate on him should we remain thus in darkness?\n\n478\n\nIf a horse eat lime, it will grow great. How should it hereby attain and\nnourish the truth of desire. If a horse eat lime it shall become wise.\n\n479\n\nWhat is the purport of this world? Horse is the victorious steed. The horse is\nthe highest of blessings. Horse signifies a pure substance.\n\n480\n\nThere are seven living beings. The eighth ( _maya_ ) is not living--all the\nmighty are in anxiety. If thou look into thy thought all words vary. (raving\nfoolery).\n\n481\n\nIf after mounting this creature, the horse, he cannot manage him, the _tatwa\nyogee_ is in trouble. Let him mount the elephant of knowledge.\n\np. 122\n\n482\n\nHe who closely views the firmament being as a globe and duly observes the moon\nabove it; he who views this well shall find it is for his good.\n\n483\n\nHe who builds a house on the open plain ( _bayalu_ ) and void of discernment\nwanders confused, is a wretch given up to his lusts. He who knows the (\n_bayalu_ ) open heaven is himself the divinity.\n\n484\n\n_Maya_ , the wife laughing, the husband is weeping (the soul), the wife\ndelights in adultery. That adultery pervades all nature.\n\n485\n\nA wife ( _maya_ ) who hath no figure loves her husband, a man void of vanity\nis a stabbing hero, a man who is diseased becomes a soldier of God.\n\np. 123\n\n486\n\nWhatever difficulties a man meets with in this world, it is not a place that\ncan be instrumented to the attainment of the next world. Then they are not\nworthy however closely you view them.\n\n487\n\nHow many are they that live on earth, in heaven, and between them has any one\nthe power to count them; those who live are indeed those who die.\n\n488\n\nThough he can teach others and know for himself the instability of the body\nand the fleeting nature of wealth, he cannot yet attach himself to an adequate\n(illustrious) devotee and attain real perfection.\n\n489\n\nThe sins that a wife commits, do with out fail fall on the husband. Of the\ngood the husband does, half comes to the wife. Why is that we are not told\nthat the sins of the husband also visit the wife.\n\n490\n\np. 124\n\nWhether misers or givers there is not one in this world, who asks not of his\nfriends; he that gives not to others, consider him as the chief of misers.\n\n491\n\nHowever many famines and sudden deaths, and terribly severe diseases occur, if\nlong life be abundantly possessed by the tribes of creatures, why should they\nso perpetually sorrow and why at every word should they, being fools say I\nhave nothing? Behold, the merciful chief spirit is alone our refuge.\n\n492\n\nA house full of holes and a worthless wife are alike. Like to a worthless wife\nis an idiot son; like an idiot son is a jeerer.\n\n493\n\nIf God be ours (if the deity has been attained by us) even the destruction we\nshall rejoice in glorious majesty, he that knows not god shall remain a\ncaptive.\n\n494\n\nIn vessel of water the sky is visible, but in the absence of water how can the\nfirmament appear therein? Regularly (or daily) comprehend thou the splendour\nof god in the vessel of the meditating intellect.\n\np. 125\n\n495\n\nHe who makes his body to be as a mill, and his senses as the oxen, likewise\nconverteth his acts into the oil seed. He through understanding shall like an\noil-man with his soul his intellect shall as fine oil be freed from carnal\nimpurities.\n\n496\n\nThey who go on pilgrimages to sacred places travel league after league merely\nthrough forests, villages, lakes and rivers. This is the sum of their good\nworks; whatever you wander (Vemadu) the divinity aideth and accompanieth you.\n\n497\n\nHe who minutely views the soul in the body who showeth forth the body in the\nsoul and who perceiveth the soul to be everywhere, he is become a part of the\ndivinity,\n\n498\n\nWhat king is able to sustain and nourish the world composed (mingled) of earth\nand sky. How is it then that man assumes the name of (Lord of Earth) king?\n\n499\n\np. 126\n\nThe wisdom of a wise man is of continual duration but the fool possesseth no\nknowledge. To know the wisdom of wisdom, this is the end of knowledge (\n_tatwa_ ).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 500-599](vov07.htm)\n\n"
