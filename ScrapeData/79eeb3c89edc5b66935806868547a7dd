And (the internal ruler is) not that which the Sm _ri_ ti assumes, (viz.\nthe pradhana,) on account of the statement of qualities not belonging to it.\n\nGood so far, a Sa _n_ khya opponent resumes. The attributes, however, of not\nbeing seen, &c., belong also to the pradhana assumed by the Sa _n_ khya-sm\n_ri_ ti, which is acknowledged to be devoid of form and other sensible\nqualities. For their\n\np. 133\n\n[paragraph continues] Sm _ri_ ti says, 'Undiscoverable, unknowable, as if\nwholly in sleep' (Manu I, 5). To this pradhana also the attribute of rulership\nbelongs, as it is the cause of all effects. Therefore the internal ruler may\nbe understood to denote the pradhana. The pradhana has, indeed, been set aside\nalready by the Sutra I, 1, 5, but we bring it forward again, because we find\nthat attributes belonging to it, such as not being seen and the like, are\nmentioned in Scripture.\n\nTo this argumentation the Sutrakara replies that the word 'internal ruler'\ncannot denote the pradhana, because qualities not belonging to the latter are\nstated. For, although the pradhana may be spoken of as not being seen, &c, it\ncannot be spoken of as seeing, since the Sa _n_ khyas admit it to be non-\nintelligent. But the scriptural passage which forms the complement to the\npassage about the internal ruler (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 23) says expressly,\n'Unseen but seeing, unheard but hearing, unperceived but perceiving, unknown\nbut knowing.'--And Selfhood also cannot belong to the pradhana.\n\nWell, then, if the term 'internal ruler' cannot be admitted to denote the\npradhana, because the latter is neither a Self nor seeing; let us suppose it\nto denote the embodied (individual) soul, which is intelligent, and therefore\nhears, sees, perceives, knows; which is internal (pratya _\xc3\xb1 k_), and therefore\nof the nature of Self; and which is immortal, because it is able to enjoy the\nfruits of its good and evil actions. It is, moreover, a settled matter that\nthe attributes of not being seen, &c., belong to the embodied soul, because\nthe agent of an action, such as seeing, cannot at the same time be the object\nof the action. This is declared in scriptural passages also, as, for instance\n(B _ri_. Up. III, 4, 2), 'Thou couldst not see the seer of sight.' The\nindividual soul is, moreover, capable of inwardly ruling the complex of the\norgans of action, as it is the enjoyer. Therefore the internal ruler is the\nembodied soul.--To this reasoning the following Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 20](sbe34057.htm)\n\n"
