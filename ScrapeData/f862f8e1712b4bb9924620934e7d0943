He was born before his mother\n\n[![YAMA.](tn/07800.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/07800.jpg)  \nYAMA.  \n\nhad become afraid of her glorious husband. He was twin-brother of Yami, and,\nin the opinion of Professor Roth, they were regarded as the primeval pair from\n\np. 79\n\nwhom the human family has sprung. In another verse of the Rig-Veda they are\ndescribed as the offspring of the heavenly choristers, the Gandharvas. As\nthere were no others to perpetuate the race, Yami entreated Yama to become her\nhusband. She urged the fact that Tvastri had formed them as man and wife in\nthe womb; and therefore it was useless for him to refuse her request, as none\ncan act contrary to the ordinances of Tvastri. But Yama was firm, and resisted\nher overtures on the ground that it was monstrous for those who are preachers\nof righteousness to act unrighteously. * It is not at all easy to determine\nwhat was intended to be represented by these deities. Max-Muller understands\nVivasvat to be the sky, Saranya the dawn, Yama the day, and Yami the night.\nOthers suggest that Yama may be the hot air current caused by the rising sun,\nand Yami the cooler air of the night, and their antagonism would be\nrepresented by Yama repelling the advances of Yami.\n\nYama was the first of mortals who died, and, having discovered the way to the\nother world, is the guide of those who depart this life, and is said to\nconduct them to a home which is made secure for them for ever. He is a king,\nand dwells in celestial light in the innermost sanctuary of heaven. He grants\nbright homes to the pious who dwell with him. \xe2\x80\xa0\n\n"In the Rig-Veda, Yama is nowhere represented (as he is in the later\nmythology) as having anything to do with the punishment of the wicked.\nNevertheless he is still to some an object of terror. He is said to have two\ninsatiable dogs, with four eyes and wide nostrils, which guard the road to his\nabode, and which the departed are advised to hurry past with all possible\n\np. 80\n\nspeed. These dogs are said to wander about among men as messengers, no doubt\nfor the purpose of summoning them to the presence of their master, who in\nanother place is identified with; death, and is described as sending a bird as\nthe herald of doom." *\n\n"When the remains of the deceased have been placed upon the funeral pile, and\nthe process of cremation has commenced, Agni, the god of Fire, is prayed not\nto scorch or consume the departed, not to tear asunder his skin or his limbs,\nbut, after the flames have done their work, to convey to the fathers the\nmortal who has been presented to him as an offering. Leaving behind on earth\nall that is evil and imperfect, and proceeding by the paths which the fathers\ntrod, invested with a lustre like that of the gods, it soars to the realms of\neternal light in a car, or on wings, and recovers there its ancient body in a\ncomplete and glorified form; meets with the forefathers who are living in\nfestivity with Yama; obtains from him, when recognized by him as one of his\nown, a delectable abode, and enters upon more perfect life, which is crowned\nwith the fulfilment of all desires, is passed in the presence of the gods, and\nemployed in the fulfilment of their pleasure." \xe2\x80\xa0\n\nIn this kingdom, over which Yama reigns, friends meet with their departed\nfriends--husband with wife, children with parents--and together live in a\nstate of blessedness, free from the evils and infirmities that belong to the\npresent life. As the gods are described as enjoying the pleasures common to\nmen on earth, the kingdom of Yama, the abode of the departed, is not at all\nless sensual than the present world; and when mortals have been privileged to\nenter this happy land, they become objects of veneration to their descendants\n\np. 81\n\nstill living, and joyfully partake of the oblations they offer to them.\n\nIn the following lines Dr. Muir * has given an epitome of the teaching of the\nVedas respecting Yama:--\n\n"To great King Yama homage pay,  \n   Who was the first of men that died,  \n   That crossed the mighty gulf and spied  \n For mortals out the heavenward way.\n\n   *           *           *           *\n\n "By it our fathers all have passed;  \n   And that same path we too shall trace,  \n   And every new succeeding race,  \n Of mortal men, while time shall last.\n\n"The god assembles round his throne  \n   A growing throng, the good and wise  \n   All those whom, scanned with searching eyes,  \n He recognizes as his own.\n\n"Departed mortal, speed from earth  \n   By those old ways thy sires have trod;  \n   Ascend, behold the expectant god  \n Who calls thee to a higher birth.\n\n   *           *           *           *\n\n"And calmly pass without alarm  \n   The four-eyed hounds that guard the road  \n   Which leads to Yama\'s bright abode;  \n Their master\'s friends they dare not harm.\n\n"All imperfections leave behind:  \n   Assume thine ancient frame once more--  \n   Each limb and sense thou hadst before,  \n From every earthly taint refined.\n\n"And now with heavenly glory bright,  \n   With life intenser, nobler, blest,  \n   With large capacity to taste  \n A fuller measure of delight,\n\np. 82\n\n"Thou there once more each well-known face  \n   Shalt see of those thou lovedst here;  \n   Thy parents, wife, and children dear,  \n With rapture shalt thou soon embrace\n\n"The father, too, shalt thou behold,  \n   The heroes who in battle died,  \n   The saints and sages glorified,  \n The pious, bounteous kings of old.\n\n"The gods whom here in humble wise  \n   Thou worshippedst with doubt and awe,  \n   Shall there the impervious veil withdraw  \n Which hid their glory from thine eyes.\n\n"The good which thou on earth hast wrought.  \n   Each sacrifice, each pious deed,  \n   Shall there receive its ample meed;  \n No worthy act shall be forgot.\n\n"In those fair realms of cloudless day,  \n   Where Yama every joy supplies,  \n   And every longing satisfies,  \n Thy bliss shall never know decay."\n\nIn the Pur\xc4\x81nas Yama is called the judge of men, and is said to rule over the\nmany hells in which the wicked are made to suffer. Thus the "Padma Pur\xc4\x81na"\nsays: "Yama fulfils the office of judge of the dead, as well as sovereign of\nthe damned; all that die appearing before him, and being confronted with\nChitragupta the recorder, by whom their actions have been registered. The\nvirtuous are then conveyed to Swarga (Indra\'s heaven), whilst the wicked are\ndriven to the different regions of Naraka (hell)." * In the "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na"\nthe names of the different hells are given, and it is there stated that "\nthere are many other fearful hells which are the awful provinces of Yama,\nterrible with instruments of torture and fire." In the same Pur\xc4\x81na \xe2\x80\xa0 it is\nsaid that\n\np. 83\n\n[paragraph continues] "all men at the end of their existence (life) become\nslaves to the power of Yama, by whom they are sentenced to painful\npunishments." Inquiry is then made as to how men can be free from his\nauthority. The answer is that "Yama is the lord of all men, excepting the\nworshippers of Madhus\xc5\xabdan (Vishnu). Worship him in one of his many forms, and\nYama can exert no authority over you."\n\nAccording to the popular ideas now prevailing, Yama is represented as a green\nman, clothed in red garments. He has a crown on his head, and a flower in his\nhair; is armed with a club, and rides upon a buffalo. He is regularly\nworshipped once a year; and daily a little water is poured out to him. For a\nwhole month each year unmarried girls present offerings to him in the hope\nthat he will provide them with a husband; and that, having granted this boon,\nhe will not recall his gift, and leave them widows. In his presence the good\nand evil deeds of the departed are weighed: according to the turn of the\nscale, the soul goes to heaven or hell. The soul is believed to reach Yama\'s\nabode in four hours and forty minutes; consequently a dead body cannot be\nburned until that time has passed after death.\n\nIn the "Bhavishya Pur\xc4\x81na" the following legend of Yama\'s marriage is found. He\nwas exceedingly pleased with a girl named Vijaya, a Br\xc4\x81hman\'s daughter. When\nfirst she saw him she was greatly alarmed, alike at his appearance and on\nlearning who he was. At length he allayed her fears; and, although her brother\ntried to dissuade her, she consented to become his wife. On her arrival at\nYama\'s abode, he particularly cautioned her against going into the southern\nquarter of his kingdom. After a time, thinking he must have another wife\nthere, her curiosity overpowered her, and going into the\n\np. 84\n\nforbidden region, she was greatly distressed, as she saw the wicked in\ntorment: Amongst other sufferers was her own mother. Meeting Yama there, she\ntried to obtain her release. Yama declared that this could not be granted\nunless some one then living on earth would perform a certain sacrifice, and\ntransfer the merit of the act to the poor woman then suffering. After some\ndifficulty, one was found willing to perform this act of kindness, and Yama\'s\nmother-in-law obtained release.\n\nStories are told in the Pur\xc4\x81nas to show how the power of Vishnu is exercised\non behalf of his worshippers in rescuing them from Yama\'s bonds. If a man\nrepeat his name in teaching it to his parrot, or utter it in death without any\nintention of asking his help, his messengers will be sent to snatch him from\nthe punishments of hell and conduct him to his blest abode.\n\nIt is very strange to notice how the character of Yama\'s rule and kingdom has\nentirely changed in the conceptions of the Hindus. According to the Vedas, the\npure and good went with gladness to Yama\'s realm of light; now, as taught in\nthe Pur\xc4\x81nas, it is the wicked who are sent to him for punishment.\n\nIn the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata * is a most interesting story, showing that sometimes Yama\nis propitious to prayer, and will allow those who have entered his abode to\nreturn to earth.\n\nA princess named Savitri loved Satyav\xc4\x81n, the son of an old hermit, but was\nwarned by a seer to overcome her attachment, as Satyav\xc4\x81n was a doomed man,\nhaving only one year to live. Savitri replies:\n\n"Whether his years be few or many, be he gifted with all grace  \n Or graceless, him my heart hath chosen, and it chooseth not again."\n\np. 85\n\nThey were married, and the bride strove to forget the prophecy; but, as the\nlast day of the year approached, her anxiety became irrepressible. She\nexhausted herself in prayers and penances, hoping to stay the hand of the\ndestroyer, yet all the while dared not reveal the fatal secret to her husband.\nAt last the dreaded day arrived, and Satyav\xc4\x81n set out to cut wood in the\nforest. His wife asked leave to accompany him, and walked behind him, smiling,\nbut with a heavy heart. Satyav\xc4\x81n soon made the wood resound with his hatchet,\nwhen suddenly a thrill of agony shot through his temples, and, feeling himself\nfalling, called his wife to support him.\n\n"Then she received her fainting husband in her arms, and sat herself  \n On the cold ground, and gently laid his drooping head upon her lap:  \n Sorrowing, she called to mind the sage\'s prophecy, and reckoned up  \n The days and hours. All in an instant she beheld an awful shape  \n Standing before her, dressed in blood-red garments, with a glittering crown  \n Upon his head; his form, though. glowing like the Sun, was yet obscure,  \n And eyes lie had like flames, a noose depended from his hand; and he  \n Was terrible to look upon, as by her husband\'s side he stood  \n And gazed upon him with a fiery glance. Shuddering she started up,  \n And laid her dying Satyav\xc4\x81n upon the ground, and, with her hands  \n Joined reverently, she thus with beating heart addressed the shape:  \n Surely thou art a god; such form as thine must more than mortal be!  \n Tell me, thou god-like being, who thou art, and wherefore art thou here?\'"\n\nThe figure replied that he was Yama, king of the dead; that her husband\'s time\nwas come, and that he must bind and take his spirit.\n\n"Then from her husband\'s body forced he out, and firmly with his cord  \n Bound and detained the spirit, clothed in form no larger than a thumb.  \n Forthwith the body, reft of vital being and deprived of breath,  \n Lost all its grace and beauty, and became ghastly and motionless."\n\np. 86\n\nAfter binding the spirit, Yama proceeds with it towards the quarter of which\nhe is guardian--the south.\n\nThe faithful wife follows him closely. Yama bids her go home and perform the\nfuneral rites; but she persists in following, till Yama, pleased with her\ndevotion, grants her any boon she pleases, except the life of her husband. She\nchooses that her husband\'s father, who is now blind, may recover his sight.\nYama consents, and bids her now return home. Still she persists in following.\nTwo other boons are granted in the same way, and still Savitri follows closely\non the heels of the king of death. At last, overcome by her constancy, Yama\ngrants a boon without exception. The delighted Savitri exclaims:\n\n"Nought, mighty king, this time hast thou excepted: let my husband live;  \n Without him I desire not happiness, nor even heaven itself;  \n Without him I must die.\' \'So be it, faithful wife,\' replied the king of\ndeath:  \n Thus I release him;\' and with that he loosed the cord that bound his soul."\n\nAmongst the many names by which Yama is known, the following are the most\ncommon:--\n\nDharmar\xc4\x81ja, "King of righteousness."\n\nPitripati, "Lord of the fathers."\n\nSamavurti, "He who judges impartially."\n\nKrit\xc4\x81nta, "The finisher."\n\nSamana, "The leveller."\n\nK\xc4\x81la, "Time."\n\nDandadhara, "He who carries the rod."\n\nSr\xc4\x81ddhadeva, "The god of funeral ceremonies."\n\nVaivasvata, "The son of Vivasvata."\n\nAntaka, "He who puts an end to life."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[79:*](hmvp14.htm#fr_81) Muir, O.
