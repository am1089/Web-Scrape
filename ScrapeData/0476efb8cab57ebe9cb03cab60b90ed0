I wish\n\np. 492\n\nnow to hear a more particular description, holy Rishi, of the portion of\nVishn\xcc\x81u 2 that came down upon earth, and was born in the family of Yadu. Tell\nme also what actions he performed in his descent, as a part of a part of the\nsupreme, upon the earth 3.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--I will relate to you, Maitreya, the account which you\n\np. 493\n\nhave requested; the birth of a part of a part of Vishn\xcc\x81u, and the benefits\nwhich his actions conferred upon the world.\n\nVasudeva formerly married the daughter of Devaka, the illustrious Devaki, a\nmaiden of celestial beauty. After their nuptials, Kansa, the increaser of the\nrace of Bhoja, drove their car as their charioteer. As they were going along,\na voice in the sky, sounding aloud and deep as thunder, addressed Kansa, and\nsaid, "Fool that you are, the eighth child of the damsel whom you are driving\nin the car shall take away your life 4!" On hearing this, Kansa drew his\nsword, and was about to put Devaki to death; but Vasudeva interposed, saying,\n"Kill not Devaki, great warrior; spare her life, and I will deliver to you\nevery child that she may bring forth." Appeased by which promise, and relying\non the character of Vasudeva, Kansa desisted from the attempt.\n\nAt that time, Earth, overburdened by her load, repaired to mount Meru to an\nassembly of the gods, and addressing the divinities, with Brahma at their\nhead, related in piteous accents all her distress. "Agni," said Earth, "is the\nprogenitor of gold; Surya, of rays of light 5: the parent and guide of me and\nof all spheres is the supreme Narayan\xcc\x81a, who is Brahma, the lord of the lord\nof patriarchs; the eldest of the eldest born; one with minutes and hours; one\nwith time; having form, though indiscrete. This assemblage of yourselves, O\ngods, is but a part of him. The sun, the winds, the saints, the Rudras, the\nVasus, the Aswins, fire, the patriarch creators of the universe, of whom Atri\nis the first, all are but forms of the mighty and inscrutable Vishn\xcc\x81u. The\nYakshas, Rakshasas, Daityas, spirits of evil, serpents, and children of Danu,\nthe singers and nymphs of heaven, are forms of the great spirit, Vishn\xcc\x81u. The\nheavens painted with planets, constellations, and stars; fire, water, wind,\nand myself, and every perceptible thing; the whole universe itself--consists\nof Vishn\xcc\x81u. The multifarious forms of that manifold being encounter\n\np. 494\n\nand succeed one another, night and day, like the waves of the sea. At this\npresent season many demons, of whom Kalanemi is the chief, have overrun, and\ncontinually harrass, the region of mortals. The great Asura Kalanemi 6, that\nwas killed by the powerful Vishn\xcc\x81u, has revived in Kansa, the son of Ugrasena,\nand many other mighty demons, more than I can enumerate, as Arisht\xcc\x81a, Dhenuka,\nKe\xc5\x9bin, Pralamba, Naraka, Sunda, and the fierce Ban\xcc\x81a, the son of Bali 7, are\nborn in the palaces of kings. Countless hosts of proud and powerful spirits,\nchiefs of the demon race, assuming celestial forms, now walk the earth; and,\nunable to support myself beneath the incumbent load, I come to you for\nsuccour. Illustrious deities, do you so act that I may be relieved from my\nburden, lest helpless I sink into the nethermost abyss."\n\nWhen the gods had heard these complaints of Earth, Brahma at their request\nexplained to them how her burden might be lightened. "Celestials," said\nBrahma, "all that Earth has said is undoubtedly true. I, Mahadeva, and you\nall, are but Narayan\xcc\x81a; but the impersonations of his power are for ever\nmutually fluctuating, and excess or diminution is indicated by the\npredominance of the strong, and the depression of the weak. Come therefore,\nlet us repair to the northern coast of the milky sea, and having glorified\nHari, report to him what we have heard. He, who is the spirit of all, and of\nwhom the universe consists, constantly, for the sake of Earth, descends in a\nsmall portion of his essence to establish righteousness below." Accordingly\nBrahma, attended by the gods, went to the milky sea, and there, with minds\nintent upon him, praised him whose emblem is Garud\xcc\x81a.\n\n"O thou," said Brahma, "who art distinct from holy writ 8; whose double nature\nis twofold wisdom 9, superior and inferior, and who art the\n\np. 495\n\nessential end of both; who, alike devoid and possessed of form, art the\ntwofold Brahma 10; smallest of the least, and largest of the large; all, and\nknowing all things; that spirit which is language; that spirit which is\nsupreme; that which is Brahma, and of which Brahma is composed! Thou art the\nRich, the Yajush, the Saman, and the Atharvan Vedas. Thou art accentuation,\nritual, signification, metre, and astronomy; history, tradition, grammar,\ntheology, logic, and law: thou who art inscrutable. Thou art the doctrine that\ninvestigates the distinctions between soul, and life, and body, and matter\nendowed with qualities 11; and that doctrine is nothing else but thy nature\ninherent in and presiding over it 12. Thou art imperceptible, indescribable,\ninconceivable; without name, or colour, or hands, or feet; pure, eternal, and\ninfinite. Thou hearest without ears, and seest without eyes. Thou art one and\nmultiform. Thou movest without feet; thou seizest without hands. Thou knowest\nall, but art not by all to be known 13. He who beholds thee as the most\nsubtile of atoms, not substantially existent, puts an end to ignorance; and\nfinal emancipation is the reward of that wise man whose understanding\ncherishes nothing other than thee in the form of supreme delight 14. Thou art\nthe common centre of all 15, the protector of the\n\np. 496\n\nworld; and all beings exist in thee: all that has been, or will be, thou art.\nThou art the atom of atoms; thou art spirit; thou only art distinct from\nprimeval nature 16. Thou, as the lord of fire in four manifestations 17,\ngivest light and fertility to Earth. Thou art the eye of all, and wearer of\nmany shapes, and unobstructedly traversest the three regions of the universe.\nAs fire, though one, is variously kindled, and, though unchangeable in its\nessence, is modified in many ways, so thou, lord, who art one omnipresent\nform, takest upon thee all modifications that exist. Thou art one supreme;\nthou art that supreme and eternal state which the wise behold with the eye of\nknowledge. There is nothing else but thou, O lord; nothing else has been or\nwill be. Thou art both discrete and indiscrete, universal and individual,\nomniscient, all-seeing, omnipotent, possessed of all wisdom and strength and\npower. Thou art liable neither to diminution nor increase; thou art\nindependent and without beginning; thou art the subjugator of all. Thou art\nunaffected by weariness, sloth, fear, anger, or desire. Thou art free from\nsoil, supreme, merciful 18, uniform, undecaying, lord over all, the stay of\nall, the fountain of light, imperishable. To thee, uninvested by material\nenvelopes 19, unexposed to sensible imaginings, aggregate of elemental\nsubstance 20, spirit supreme, be adoration. Thou assumest a shape, O pervader\nof the universe, not as the consequence of virtue or vice, nor from any\nmixture of the two, but for the sole object of maintaining piety in the world\n21."\n\np. 497\n\nThe unborn, universal Hari, having heard with his mental ear these eulogiums,\nwas pleased, and thus spake to Brahma: "Tell me, Brahma, what you and the gods\ndesire: speak boldly, certain of success." Brahma, beholding the divine,\nuniversal form of Hari, quickly prostrated himself, and again renewed his\npraises. "Glory to thee, the thousand-formed, the thousand-armed, the many-\nvisaged, many-footed; to thee, the illimitable author of creation,\npreservation, and destruction; most subtile of the subtile, most vast of the\ngreat: to thee, who art nature, intellect, and consciousness; and who art\nother spirit even than the spiritual root of those principles 22. Do thou shew\nfavour upon us. Behold, lord, this earth, oppressed by mighty Asuras, and\nshaken to her mountain basements, comes to thee, who art her invincible\ndefender, to be relieved from her burden. Behold me, Indra, the Aswins,\nVarun\xcc\x81a, and Yama, the Rudras, the Vasus, the suns, the winds, fire, and all\nother celestials, prepared to execute whatever thou shalt will that we shall\ndo. Do thou, in whom there is no imperfection, O sovereign of the deities,\ngive thy orders to thy servants: lo, we are ready."\n\nWhen Brahma had ended, the supreme lord plucked off two hairs, one white and\none black, and said to the gods, "These my hairs shall descend upon earth, and\nshall relieve her of the burden of her distress 23.\n\np. 498\n\n[paragraph continues] Let all the gods also, in their own portions, go down to\nearth, and wage war with the haughty Asuras, who are there incorporate, and\nwho shall every one of them be destroyed. Doubt not of this: they shall perish\nbefore the withering glance of mine eyes. This my (black) hair shall be\nimpersonated in the eighth conception of the wife of Vasudeva, Devaki, who is\nlike a goddess; and shall slay Kansa, who is the demon Kalanemi." Thus having\nspoken, Hari disappeared; and the gods bowing to him, though invisible,\nreturned to the summit of mount Meru, from whence they descended upon earth.\n\nThe Muni Narada informed Kansa that the supporter of the earth, Vishn\xcc\x81u, would\nbe the eighth child of Devaki; and his wrath being excited by this report, he\nplaced both Vasudeva and Devaki in confinement. Agreeably to his promise, the\nformer delivered to Kansa each infant as soon as it was born. It is said that\nthese, to the number of six, were the children of the demon Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu,\nwho were introduced into the womb of Devaki, at the command of Vishn\xcc\x81u, during\nthe hours of Devaki\'s repose, by the goddess Yoganidra 24, the great illusory\nenergy of Vishn\xcc\x81u, by whom, as utter ignorance, the whole world is beguiled.\nTo her Vishn\xcc\x81u said, "Go, Nidra, to the nether regions, and by my command\nconduct successively six of their princes to be conceived of Devaki. When\nthese shall have been put to death by Kansa, the seventh conception shall be\nformed of a portion of \xc5\x9aesha, who is a part of me; and this you shall\ntransfer, before the time of birth, to Rohin\xcc\x81i, another wife of Vasudeva, who\nresides at Gokula. The report shall run, that Devaki miscarries, through the\nanxiety of imprisonment, and dread of the Raja of the Bhojas. From being\nextracted from his mother\'s womb, the child shall be known by the name of\nSankarshan\xcc\x81a, and he shall be valiant and strong, and like the peak of the\nwhite mountain in\n\np. 499\n\nbulk and complexion. I will myself become incarnate in the eighth conception\nof Devaki; and you shall immediately take a similar character as the embryo\noffspring of Ya\xc5\x9boda. In the night of the eighth lunation of the dark half of\nthe month Nabhas, in the season of the rains, I shall be born. You shall\nreceive birth on the ninth. Impelled and aided by my power, Vasudeva shall\nbear me to the bed of Ya\xc5\x9boda, and you to that of Devaki. Kansa shall take you,\nand hold you up to dash you against a stone; but you shall escape from his\ngrasp into the sky, where the hundred-eyed Indra shall meet and do homage to\nyou, through reverence for me, and shall bow before you, and acknowledge you\nas his sister. Having slain Sumbha, Nisumbha, and numerous other demons 25,\nyou shall sanctify the earth in many places 26. Thou art wealth, progeny,\nfame, patience, heaven and earth, fortitude, modesty, nutrition, dawn, and\nevery other female (form or property). They who address thee morning and\nafternoon with reverence and praise, and call thee \xc3\x81rya, Durga, Vedagarbha,\nAmbika, Bhadra, Bhadrakali, Kshemi, or Kshemankari, shall receive from my\nbounty whatever they desire. Propitiated with offerings of wine and flesh and\nvarious viands, thou shalt bestow upon mankind all their prayers. Through my\nfavour all men shall ever have faith in thee. Assured of this, go, goddess,\nand execute my commands."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[491:1](vp118.htm#fr_1438) The whole of this book is dedicated to the\nbiography of Krishn\xcc\x81a. Many of the Puran\xcc\x81as omit this subject altogether, or\nonly allude to it occasionally. In others it is equally prominent. The Brahma\nP. gives the story exactly in the same words as our text: which has the best\nright to them may be questioned; but, as it is usually met with, the Brahma P.\nis a very heterogeneous compilation. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba has a narrative more\ndetailed than that of the text, with additions and embellishments of its own.\nThe Brahma Vaivartta throughout celebrates the acts of Krishn\xcc\x81a; and one\nportion of it, the Krishn\xcc\x81a Janma Khan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a, especially describes his boyhood\nand youth. The incidents are the same in general as those in the text, but\nthey are lost amidst interminable descriptions of Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s sports with the\nGopis and with his mistress Radha, a person not noticed elsewhere; the whole\nis in a style indicative of a modern origin. The Agni P. and Padma P. (Uttara\nKhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a) have accounts of Krishn\xcc\x81a, but they are mere summaries, compiled\nevidently from other works. The principal authority for the adventures of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a is the Bhagavata, the tenth book of which is exclusively devoted to\nhim. It is this work which has, no doubt, mainly extended the worship of\nKrishn\xcc\x81a, as its popularity is evinced by its having been translated into all\nthe spoken languages of India professing to have a literature. The Prem-sagar,\nits Hindi version, is well known; but there are also translations in Mahratta,\nTelugu, Tamil, &c. It does not seem likely, however, that the Vishn\xcc\x81u P. has\ncopied the Bhagavata; for although. its greater conciseness may sometimes look\nlike abridgment, yet the descriptions are generally of a more simple and\nantiquated character. Here, as usual, the p. 492 Mahabharata is no doubt the\nearliest extant authority; but it is not the earliest, for whilst it omits to\nnarrate most of his personal adventures unconnected with his alliance with the\nPan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81avas, it often alludes to them, and names repeatedly his capital, his\nwives, and his progeny. It also devotes a section, the Mau\xc5\x9bala P., to the\ndestruction of the Yadavas. The story of Krishn\xcc\x81a the prince and hero must\nhave been complete when the Mahabharata was compiled. It is doubtful, however,\nif Krishn\xcc\x81a the boy, and his adventures at Vrindavan, were not subsequent\ninventions. There are no allusions to them in the poem, of an unsuspicious\nnature. The only ones that I have met with are contained in a speech by\n\xc5\x9ai\xc5\x9bupala, Sabha P., vol. I. p. 360, in which he reviles Krishn\xcc\x81a; but they may\neasily have been interpolated. There may be others scattered through the poem,\nbut I have not observed them.\n\n[492:2](vp118.htm#fr_1439) The notices of Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s origin and character in\nvarious passages of the Mahabharata are by no means consistent, and indicate\ndifferent dates at least. In an address to him by Arjuna, Vana P., vol. I. p.\n436, he is said to have passed thousands of years in various holy places,\nengaged in arduous penances. He is frequently identified with the Rishi\nNarayan\xcc\x81a, or he and Arjuna are said to be Nara and Narayan\xcc\x81a. In the Dana-\ndharma he is represented as a worshipper of \xc5\x9aiva, and propitiating him and his\nwife Uma, and receiving as boons from them wives and children. As a warrior\nand prince he is always on the scene; but he is repeatedly called an An\xc5\x9ba, or\nportion of Vishn\xcc\x81u; whilst in a great number of places he is identified with\nVishn\xcc\x81u or Narayan\xcc\x81a, and is consequently \'all things.\' This latter is his\ncharacter, of course, amongst the Vaishn\xcc\x81avas, agreeably to the text of the\nBhagavata: \'Krishn\xcc\x81a is the lord (Vishn\xcc\x81u) himself.\'\n\n[492:3](vp118.htm#fr_1440) This is a still farther diminution of Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s\ndignity; he is not even a part, but \'a part of a part,\' An\xc5\x9ban\xc5\x9bavatara: but\nthis, the commentator maintains, is to be understood only of his form or\ncondition as man, not of his power, as it suffered no diminution, either in\nits primary or secondary state, as light by suffusion suffers no decrease; and\na verse of the Veda is cited to this effect: \'Though that which is full be\ntaken from what is full, yet the remainder is undiminished;\' \'Krishn\xcc\x81a is\nnevertheless the very supreme Brahma, though it be a mystery how the supreme\nshould assume the form of a man.\' So the Bhagavata in one passage predicts\nthat the Para-purusha, Purushottama or Vishn\xcc\x81u, will be born visibly in the\ndwelling of Vasudeva.\n\n[493:4](vp118.htm#fr_1441) The Bhagavata tells the circumstance as in the\ntext. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba makes Narada apprise Kansa of his danger. Narada\'s\ninterposition is not mentioned until afterwards by our authority. Devaki is\nthe cousin of Kansa: see [p. 436](vp107.htm#page_436).\n\n[493:5](vp118.htm#fr_1442) Agni, or fire, refines gold, burns away the dross,\naccording to the commentator. The sun is the lord of the rays of light; or, as\nthe cause of rain and vegetation, the lord of cattle. The phrase is, ###.\n\n[494:6](vp118.htm#fr_1443) According to the Vayu, Kalanemi or Kayabadha was a\nson of Virochana, the grandson of Hiran\xcc\x81yaka\xc5\x9bipu: his death is described in\nthe Hari Van\xc5\x9ba.\n\n[494:7](vp118.htm#fr_1444) These appear subsequently in the narration, and are\ndestroyed by Krishn\xcc\x81a.\n\n[494:8](vp118.htm#fr_1445) Anamnaya; not the immediate object of the Vedas,\nwhich is devotion, not abstraction; ritual or worship, not knowledge.\n\n[494:9](vp118.htm#fr_1446) The two kinds of knowledge are termed Para,\n\'supreme,\' and Apara, \'other\' or \'subordinate;\' the first is knowledge of Para\nBrahma, of spirit abstractedly considered, perfect knowledge derived from\nabstraction; the p. 495 second is knowledge of \xc5\x9aabda Brahma, of spirit as\ndescribed and taught in the Vedas, or their supplementary branches. The\nidentity of the supreme with both descriptions of holy knowledge pervades the\nwhole of the address.\n\n[495:10](vp118.htm#fr_1447) Para Brahma and \xc5\x9aabda Brahma: see the preceding\nnote.\n\n[495:11](vp118.htm#fr_1448) The doctrine alluded to may be either intended\ngenerally, or in the several instances, the discussion of the spiritual soul\nand living soul, of body subtile and sensible, and of matter endowed with\nqualities, reference may be purposed to the Vedanta, Yoga, and Sankhya\nsystems.\n\n[495:12](vp118.htm#fr_1449) That is, as the \xc5\x9aabda Brahma, the supreme is\nidentical with philosophical doctrines, being the object, the instigator, and\nthe result.\n\n[495:13](vp118.htm#fr_1450) This is taken from the Vedas, the original of\nwhich is quoted and translated by Sir Win. Jones: see his Works, XIII. 368.\nThe passage is thus cited by the commentator on our text: \'Without hand or\nfoot he runs, he grasps; without eyes he sees; and without ears he hears: he\nknoweth all that may be known, and no one knoweth him. Him they call the first\ngreat spirit.\'\n\n[495:14](vp118.htm#fr_1451) Varenya rupa, explained by Paramananda murtti; he\nwhose form or impersonation is supreme felicity.\n\n[495:15](vp118.htm#fr_1452) Literally \'navel of all.\' p. 496 The passage is\nalso read \'Thou art all and the first;\' the cause or creator.\n\n[496:16](vp118.htm#fr_1453) Or the passage is understood, \'Thou art one\nsubsequently to Prakriti;\' that is, thou art Brahma, the active will of the\nsupreme, creating forms from rudimental matter.\n\n[496:17](vp118.htm#fr_1454) As the three fires enjoined by the Vedas, and the\nfire metaphorically of devotion; or lightnings, solar heat, fire generated\nartificially, and the fire of digestion or animal fire; or Vishn\xcc\x81u in that\ncharacter bestows beauty, vigour, power, and wealth.\n\n[496:18](vp118.htm#fr_1455) Prita: one copy has \xc5\x9aanta, \'calm,\' \'undisturbed.\'\n\n[496:19](vp118.htm#fr_1456) Beyond the separate layers or envelopes of\nelementary substances (see [p. 19](vp036.htm#page_19)); or, according to the\nVedanta notions, uninvested by those grosser sheaths or coverings, derived\nfrom food and the like, by which subtile body is enclosed.\n\n[496:20](vp118.htm#fr_1457) Mahavibhuti sansthana. Vibhuti is explained by\nPrapancha, sensible, material, or elementary substance, constituting body.\n\n[496:21](vp118.htm#fr_1458) The passage is somewhat obscurely expressed, and\nis differently interpreted; p. 497 it is, \'Not from no cause, nor from cause,\nnor from cause and no cause.\' The term \'no cause\' may, the commentator says,\ndesignate fixed prescribed duties, the Nityakarma; \'cause\' may signify\noccasional sacrifices, the Kamya-karma: neither of these can form any\nnecessity for Vishn\xcc\x81u\'s descent, as they might of a mere mortal\'s being born\non the earth: or Karan\xcc\x81a is explained to mean \'obtaining pleasure,\' from Ka\nand \xc3\x81ran\xcc\x81a, \'obtaining;\' obtaining happiness, or the cause of it, piety,\nvirtue; and with the negative, Akaran\xcc\x81a, the reverse, pain, the consequence of\nwickedness. The purport is clear enough; it is merely meant to state that\nVishn\xcc\x81u is not subject to the necessity which is the cause of human birth.\n\n[497:22](vp118.htm#fr_1459) The term Pradhana, which is repeated in this\npassage, is explained in the second place to mean Puman, \'soul\' or \'spirit.\'\n\n[497:23](vp118.htm#fr_1460) The same account of the origin of Krishn\xcc\x81a is\ngiven in the Mahabharata, \xc3\x81di P., vol. I. p. 266. The white hair is\nimpersonated as Balarama; the black, as Krishn\xcc\x81a. The commentator on our text\nmaintains that this is not to be literally understood: \'Vishn\xcc\x81u did not intend\nthat the two hairs should become incarnate, but he meant to signify, that,\nshould he send them, they would be more than sufficient to destroy Kansa and\nhis demons: or the birth of Rama and Krishn\xcc\x81a was a double illusion, p. 498\ntypified by the two hairs.\' This seems to be a refinement upon an older and\nsomewhat undignified account of the origin of Krishn\xcc\x81a and his brother. The\ncommentator on the Mahabharata argues that they are to be understood merely as\nthe media by which Devaki and Rohini conceived.\n\n[498:24](vp118.htm#fr_1461) Yoganidra is the sleep of devotion or abstraction,\nthe active principle of illusion, personified, and also termed Maya and\nMahamaya, also Avidya or ignorance. In the Durga Mahatmya of the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya\nPuran\xcc\x81a a she appears as Devi or Durga, the \xc5\x9aakti or bride of \xc5\x9aiva; but in our\ntext as Vaishn\xcc\x81avi, or the \xc5\x9aakti of Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\n[499:25](vp118.htm#fr_1462) Allusion is here made to the exploits of Durga, as\ncelebrated especially in the Durga Mahatmya; and it must be posterior to the\ndate of that or some similar composition. The passage may be an interpolation,\nas the Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya P. in general has the appearance of being a more recent\ncompilation than the Vishn\xcc\x81u.\n\n[499:26](vp118.htm#fr_1463) This refers to the Pit\xcc\x81ha sthanas, \'fifty-one\nplaces,\' where, according to the Tantras, the limbs of \xc5\x9aati fell, when\nscattered by her husband \xc5\x9aiva, as he bore her dead body about, and tore it to\npieces, after she had put an end to her existence at Daksha\'s sacrifice. This\npart of the legend seems to be an addition to the original fable made by the\nTantras, as it is not in the Puran\xcc\x81as (see the story of Daksha\'s sacrifice).\nIt bears some analogy to the Egyptian fable of Isis and Osiris. At the Pit\xcc\x81ha\nsthanas, however, of Jwalamukhi, Vindhyavasini, Kalighat, and others, temples\nare erected to the different forms of Devi or \xc5\x9aati, not to the phallic emblem\nof Mahadeva, which, if present, is there as an accessory and embellishment,\nnot as a principal, and the chief object of worship is a figure of the\ngoddess; a circumstance in which there is an essential difference between the\ntemples of Durga and shrines of Osiris.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II](vp119.htm)\n\n'
