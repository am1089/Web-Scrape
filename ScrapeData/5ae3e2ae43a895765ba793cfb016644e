Narada said :-- How did Naraya _n_ a impregnate Tulasi? Kindly describe\nall that in detail.\n\n\n\n2-11. Naraya _n_ a said :-- For accomplishing the ends of the Devas, Bhagavan\nHari assumed the Vai _sn_ avi Maya, took the Kavacha from S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a and\nassuming his form, went to the house of Tulasi. Dundubhis (celestial drums)\nwere sounded at Her door, shouts of\n\n\n\np. 898\n\n\n\nvictory were proclaimed and Tulasi was informed. The chaste Tulasi, hearing\nthat sound very gladly looked out on the royal road from the window. Then for\nauspicious observances, She offered riches to the Brahmi _n_ s; then She gave\nwealth to the panegyrists (or bards attached to the courts of princes), to the\nbeggars, and the other chanters of hymns. That time Bhagavan Naraya _n_ a\nalighted from His chariot and went to the house of the Devi Tulasi, built of\ninvaluable gems, looking exceedingly artistic and beautiful. Seeing her dear\nhusband before her, She became very glad and washed his feet and shed tears of\njoy and bowed down to Him. Then She, impelled by love, made him take his seat\non the beautiful jewel throne and giving him sweet scented betels with\ncamphor, began to say :-- \xc2\x93Today my life has been crowned with success. For I\nam seeing again my lord returned from the battle.\xc2\x94 Then she cast smiling\nglances askance at him and with her body filled with rapturous joy lovingly\nasked him the news of the war in sweet words :--\n\n\n\n12-13. O Thou, the Ocean of mercy! Now tell me of your heroic valour, how you\nhave come out victorious in war with Mahadeva who destroys countless\nuniverses. Hearing Tulasi\xc2\x92s word, the Lord of Lak _s_ mi, in the guise of\nS\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, spoke these nectar-like words with a smiling countenance.\n\n\n\n14-17. O Dear! Full one Samvatsara the war lasted betwixt us. All the Daityas\nwere killed. Then Brahma Himself came and mediated. Peace, then, was brought\nabout and by the command of Brahma, I gave over to the Devas their rights.\nWhen I returned to my home, S\xc2\x92iva went back to His S\xc2\x92ivaloka. Thus saying,\nHari, the Lord of the world, slept and then engaged in sexual intercourse with\nher. But the chaste Tulasi, finding this time her experience quite different\nfrom what She used to enjoy before, argued all the time within herself and at\nlast questioned him :--\n\n\n\n18-22. Who are you? O Magician! By spreading your magic, you have enjoyed me.\nAs you have taken my chastity, I will curse you. Bhagavan Naraya _n_ a,\nhearing Tulasi\xc2\x92s words and being afraid of the curse, assumed His real\nbeautiful figure. The Devi then saw the Eternal Lord of the Devas before her.\nHe was of a deep blue colour like fresh rain-clouds and with eyes like\nautumnal lotuses and with playful Lilas equivalent to tens and tens of\nmillions of Love personified and adorned with jewels and ornaments. His face\nwas smiling and gracious; and he wore his yellow-coloured robe. The love-\nstricken Tulasi, seeing That Lovely Form\n\n\n\np. 899\n\n\n\nof Vasudeva, immediately fell senseless; and at the next moment, regaining\nconsciousness, she began to speak.\n\n\n\n23-27. O Lord! Thou art like a stone. Thou hast no mercy. By hypocrisy Thou\nhast destroyed my chastity, my virtue and for that reason didst kill my\nhusband. O Lord! Thou had no mercy; Thy heart is like a stone. So Let Thee be\nturned into a stone. Those who declare Thee as a saint, are no doubt mistaken.\nWhy didst Thou for the sake of others, kill without any fault, another Bhakta\nof Thine. Thus speaking, Tulasi overpowered with grief and sorrow, cried aloud\nand repeatedly gave vent to lamentations. Seeing her thus very distressed,\nNaraya _n_ a, the Ocean of Mercy, spoke to her to cheer her up according to\nthe rules of Dharma.\n\n\n\n28-102. O Honoured One! For a long time you performed tapasya in this Bharata,\nto get Me. S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a, too, performed tapasya for a long time to get\nyou. By that tapas, S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a got you as wife. Now it is highly\nincumbent to award you also with the fruit that you asked for. Therefore I\nhave done this. Now quit your this terestrial body and assume a Divine Body\nand marry Me. O Rame! Be like Lak _s_ mi. This body of yours will be known by\nthe name of Ga _nd_ aki, a very virtuous, pure and pellucid stream in this\nholy land of Bharata. Your hairs will be turned into sacred trees and as they\nwill be born of you, you will be known by the name of Tulasi. All the three\nworlds will perform their Pujas with the leaves and flowers of this Tulasi.\nTherefore, O Fair-faced One! This Tulasi will be reckoned as the chief amongst\nall flowers and leaves. In Heavens, earth, and the nether regions, and before\nMe, O Fair One, you will reign as the chief amongst trees and flowers. In the\nregion of Goloka, on the banks of the river Viraja, in the Rasa circle (the\ncelestial ball dance,) where all amorous sentiments are played in Vrindarana\nforest, in Bha _n_ dira forest, in Champaka forest, in the beautiful Chandana\n(Sandal Forests and in the groves of Madhavi, Ketaki, Ku _nd_ a, Mallika, and\nMalati, in the sacred places you will live and bestow the highest religious\nmerits. All the Tirthas will reside at the bottom of the Tulasi tree and so\nreligious merits will accrue to all. O Fair-faced One! There I and all the\nDevas will wait in expectation of the falling of a Tulasi leaf. Anybody who\nwill be initiated and installed with the Tulasi leaves water, will get all the\nfruits of being initiated in all the sacrifices. Whatever pleasure Hari gets\nwhen thousands and thousands of jars filled with water are offered to him, the\nsame pleasure He will get when one Tulasi leaf will be offered to Him.\nWhatever fruits are acquired by giving Ayuta cows as presents, those will be\nalso acquired by giving Tulasi leaves. Especially\n\n\n\np. 900\n\n\n\nif one gives Tulasi leaves in the month of Kartik, one gets the fruits same as\nabove mentioned. If one drinks or gets the Tulasi leaf water at the momentous\nTime of Death, one becomes freed of all sins and is worshipped in the Vi _sn_\nu Loka. He who drinks daily the Tulasi leaf water certainly gets the fruit of\none lakh horse sacrifices. He who plucks or culls the Tulasi leaf by his own\nhand and holding it on his body, quits his life in a Tirath, goes to Vi _sn_ u\nLoka. Whoever holds in his neck the garland made up of Tulasi wood, gets\ncertainly the fruit of horse sacrifices at every step. He who does not keep\nhis word, holding the Tulasi leaf in his hand, goes to the Kalasutra Hell as\nlong as the Sun and Moon last. He who gives false evidence in the presence of\nthe Tulasi leaf, goes to the Kumbhipaka Hell for the life-periods of fourteen\nIndras. He who drinks or gets a bit of the Tulasi leaf water at the time of\ndeath, certainly goes to Vaiku _nt_ ha, ascending on a car made up of jewels.\nThose who pluck or cull the Tulasi leaves in the Full Moon night, on the\ntwelfth lunar day, on the passing of the sun from one sign to another, the\nmid-day, or on the twilights, on the night, while applying oil on their\nbodies, on the impurity periods, and while putting on night dresses, verily\neat off the Naraya _n_ a\xc2\x92s head. O Chaste One! The Tulasi leaf kept in the\nnight, is considered sacred. It is considered good in S\xc2\x92raddha, vow ceremony,\nin the making over of any gift, in the installation of any image or in\nworshipping any Deva. Again, the Tulasi leaf fallen on the ground or fallen in\nwater or offered to Vi _sn_ u, if washed out can be used in holy and other\npurposes. Thus, O Good One! You will remain as tree in this earth and will\nremain in Goloka as the Presiding Deity thereof and will enjoy daily the sport\nwith Kri _sn_ a. And also you will be the Presiding Deity of the river Ga _nd_\naki and thus bestow religious merits in Bharata; you will be the wife of the\nSalt Ocean, which is My part. You are very chaste; in Vaiku _nt_ ha you will\nenjoy me as Rama lives with Me. And as for Me, I will be turned into stone by\nyour curse; I will remain in India close to the bank of the river Ga _nd_ aki.\nMillions and millions of insects with their sharp teeth will make rings, (the\nconvolutions in the S\xc2\x92alagrama or sacred stones), on the cavities of the\nmountains there, representing Me. Of these stones, those that have one door\n(entrance hole), four convolutions, adorned by the garland of wild flowers\n(having a mark like this) and which look like fresh rain-cloud, are called Lak\n_s_ mi Naraya _n_ a Murtis (forms). And those that have one door, four\nconvolutions and look like fresh rain-clouds but no garlands are called Lak\n_s_ mi Janardana Chakras (discus). Those that have two doors, four\nconvolutions, and decked with mark like cow\xc2\x92s hoof and void of the garland\nmark are called Raghunatha chakras. Those that are very small in size, with\ntwo Chakras and look like fresh rain\n\n\n\np. 901\n\n\n\nclouds and void of the garland marks are named Vamana Chakras. Those that that\nare very small in size, with two Chakras and the garland mark added, know then\nto be the S\xc2\x92ridhara Chakras. These always bring in prosperity to the\nhousehold. Those that are big, circular, void of garland mark, with two\ncircular Chakras, are known as Damodara forms. Those that are mediocre in\nsize, with two Chakras and marked as if struck by an arrow, having marks of\narrows and bow-cases are known as Ra _n_ a-Ramas. Those that are middling,\nwith seven Chakras, having marks of an umbrella and ornaments, are called\nRajarajes\xc2\x92varas. They bestow the royal Lak _s_ mi to persons. Those that have\ntwice seven chakras, and are big, looking like fresh rain-clouds are named\nAnantas. They bestow four fold fruits (Dharma, wealth, desire and liberation).\nThose that are in their forms like a ring, with two chakras, beautiful,\nlooking like rain-clouds, having cow-hoof marks and of mediocre size are named\nMadhusudanas. Those that have one Chakra are called Sudars\xc2\x92anas. Those that\nhave their Chakras hidden are called Gadadharas. Those that have two Chakras,\nlooking horse-faced, are known as Hayagrivas. O Chaste One! Those that have\ntheir mouths very wide and extended, with two Chakras, and very terrible, are\nknown as Narasimhas. They excite Vairagyas to all who serve them. Those that\nhave two Chakras, mouths extended and with garland marks (elliptical marks)\nare called Lak _s_ mi Nrisinghas. They always bless the householders who\nworship them. Those that have two Chakras near their doors (faces), that look\neven and beautiful, and with marks manifested are known as Vasudevas. They\nyield all sorts of fruits. Those that have their Chakras fine and their forms\nlike fresh rain-clouds and have many fine hole marks within their wide gaping\nfacets are called Pradyumnas. They yield happiness to every householder. Those\nthat have their faces of two Chakras stuck together and their backs capacious,\nare known as Sa _n_ kar _s_ a _n_ as. They always bring in happiness to the\nhouseholders. Those that look yellow, round and very beautiful are Anirudhas.\nThe sages say, they give happiness to the householder. Where there is the\nS\xc2\x92alagrama stone there exists S\xc2\x92ri Hari Himself; and where there is Hari, Lak\n_s_ mi and all the Tirthas dwell there. Worshipping S\xc2\x92alagram S\xc2\x92ila, destroys\nthe Brahmahatya (killing a Brahmi _n_ ) and any other sin whatsoever. In\nworshipping the S\xc2\x92alagrama stone looking like an umbrella, kingdoms are\nobtained; in worshipping circular S\xc2\x92ilas,\n\ngreat prosperity is obtained; in worshipping cart-shaped stones, miseries\narise; and in worshipping stones, whose ends look like spears (S\xc2\x92ulas), death\ninevitably follows. Those whose facets are distorted, bring in poverty; and\nyellow stones bring in various evils and afflictions. Those whose Chakras look\nbroken, bring in diseases; and those whose Chakras\n\n\n\np. 902\n\n\n\nare rent asunder bring in death certainly. Observing vows, making gifts,\ninstalling images, doing S\xc2\x92raddhas, worshipping the Devas, all these become\nhighly exalted, if done before the S'alagrama S\xc2\x92ila. One acquires the merits\nof bathing in all the Tirthas and in being initiated in all the sacrifices, if\none worships the Salagrama S\xc2\x92ila. What more than this, that the merits\nacquired by all the sacrifices, all the Tirthas, all vows, all austerities and\nreading all the Vedas are all acquired by duly worshipping by the holy\nS\xc2\x92alagrama S\xc2\x92ila. He who performs his Abhi _s_ \xc2\x92eka ceremony always with\nS\xc2\x92alagrama water (being sprinkled with S\xc2\x92alagrama water at the initiation and\nInstallation ceremonies), acquires the religious merits of performing all\nsorts of gifts and circumambulating the whole earth. All the Devas are, no\ndoubt, pleased with him who thus worships daily the S\xc2\x92alagrama. What more than\nthis, that all the Tirthas want to have his touch. He becomes a Jivanmukta\n(liberated while living) and becomes very holy; ultimately he goes to the\nregion of S\xc2\x92ri Hari and remains in Hari\xc2\x92s service there and dwells with him\nfor countless Prakritic dissolutions. Every sin, like Brahma Hatya, flies away\nfrom him as serpents do at the sight of Garu _d_ a. The Devi Vasundhara (the\nEarth) becomes purified by the touch of the dust of his feat. At his birth,\nall his predecessors (a lakh in number), are saved. He who gets the S\xc2\x92alagrama\nS\xc2\x92ila water during the time of his death, he is freed of all his sins and goes\nto the Vi _sn_ u Loka and gets Nirva _n_ a; he becomes freed entirely from the\neffects of Karma and he gets, no doubt, dissolved and diluted for ever in (the\nfeet of) Vi _sn_ u. He who tells lies, holding S\xc2\x92alagrama in his hands, goes\nto the Kumbhipaka Hell for the life-period of Brahma. If one does not keep his\nword, uttered with the S\xc2\x92alagrama stone in his hand, one goes to the Asipatra\nHell for one lakh manvantaras. He who worships the S\xc2\x92alagrama stone without\noffering Tulasi leaves on it or separates the Tulasi leaves from the stone,\nwill have to suffer separation from his wife in his next birth. So if one does\nnot offer the Tulasi leaves in the conchshell, for seven births he remains\nwithout his wife and he becomes diseased. He who preserves the S\xc2\x92alagrama\nstone, the Tulasi and the conchshell, in one place, becomes very learned and\nbecomes dear to Naraya _n_ a. Look! He who casts his semen once in his wife,\nsuffers intense pain, no doubt, at each other\xc2\x92s separation. So you become dear\nto S\xc2\x92ankhachu _d_ a for one Manvantara. Now, what wonder! That you will suffer\npain, at his bereavement. O Narada! Thus saying, S\xc2\x92ri Hari desisted. Tulasi\nquitted her mortal coil and assumed a divine form, began to remain in the\nbreast of S\xc2\x92ri Hari like S\xc2\x92ri Lak _s_ mi Devi. Hari also went with her to\nVaiku _nt_ ha. Thus Lak _s_ mi, Sarasvati, Ganga, and Tulasi, all the four\ncame so\n\n\n\np. 903\n\n\n\nvery dear to Hari and are recognised as \xc3\x8es\xc2\x92varis. On the other hand, the\nmortal coil of Tulasi, no sooner quitted by Tulasi, became transformed into\nthe river Gandaki. Bhagavan Hari, too, became also converted into a holy\nmountain, on the banks thereof, yielding religious merits to the people. The\ninsects cut and fashion many pieces out of that mountain. Of them, those that\nfall into the river, yield fruits undoubtedly. And those pieces that fall on\nthe ground become yellow coloured; they are not at all fit for worship. O\nNarada! Thus I have spoken to you everything. What more do you want to hear\nnow? Say.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-fourth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the glory of Tulasi\nin the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_\ni Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 25](bk09ch25.htm)\n\n"
