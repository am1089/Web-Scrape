From the soft rain and green turf of Gaeldom, we\nseek the garish sun and arid soil of the Hindoo. In the Land of Ire, the\nbelief in fairies, gnomes, ogres and monsters is all but dead; in the Land of\nInd it still flourishes in all the vigour of animism.\n\nSoils and national characters differ; but fairy tales are the same in plot and\nincidents, if not in treatment. The majority of the tales in this volume have\nbeen known in the West in some form or other, and the problem arises how to\naccount for their simultaneous existence in farthest West and East. Some--as\nBenfey in Germany, M. Cosquin in France, and Mr. Clouston in England--have\ndeclared that India is the Home of the Fairy Tale, and that all European fairy\ntales have been brought from thence by Crusaders, by Mongol missionaries, by\nGipsies, by Jews, by traders, by travellers. The question is still before the\ncourts, and one can only deal with it as an advocate. So far as my\ninstructions go, I should be prepared, within certain limits, to hold a brief\nfor India. So far as the children of Europe have their fairy stories in\ncommon, these--and they form more than a third of the whole--are derived from\nIndia. In particular, the majority of the Drolls or comic tales and jingles\ncan be traced, without much difficulty, back to the Indian peninsula.\n\nCertainly there is abundant evidence of the early transmission by literary\nmeans of a considerable number of drolls and folk-tales from India about the\ntime of the Crusaders. The collections known in Europe by the titles of _The\nFables of Bidpai, The Seven Wise Masters, Gesta Romanorum,_ and _Barlaam and\nJosaphat,_ were extremely popular during the Middle Ages, and their contents\npassed on the one hand into the _Exempla_ of the monkish preachers, and on the\nother into the _Novelle_ of Italy, thence, after many days, to contribute\ntheir quota to the Elizabethan Drama. Perhaps nearly one tenth of the main\nincidents of European folk-tales can be traced to this source.\n\nThere are even indications of an earlier literary contact between Europe and\nIndia, in the case of one branch of the folk-tale, the Fable or Beast Droll.\nIn a somewhat elaborate discussion ["History of the Aesopic Fable," the\nintroductory volume to my edition of Caxton\'s _Fables of Esope_ (London, Nutt,\n1889)] I have come to the conclusion that a goodly number of the fables that\npass under the name of the Samian slave, Aesop, were derived from India,\nprobably from the same source whence the same tales were utilised in the\nJatakas, or Birth-stories of Buddha. These Jatakas contain a large quantity of\ngenuine early Indian folk-tales, and form the earliest collection of folk-\ntales in the world, a sort of Indian Grimm, collected more than two thousand\nyears before the good German brothers went on their quest among the folk with\nsuch delightful results. For this reason I have included a considerable number\nof them in this volume; and shall be surprised if tales that have roused the\nlaughter and wonder of pious Buddhists for the last two thousand years, cannot\nproduce the same effect on English children. The Jatakas have been fortunate\nin their English translators, who render with vigour and point; and I rejoice\nin being able to publish the translation of two new Jatakas, kindly done into\nEnglish for this volume by Mr. W. H. D. Rouse, of Christ\'s College, Cambridge.\nIn one of these I think I have traced the source of the Tar Baby incident in\n"Uncle Remus."\n\nThough Indian fairy tales are the earliest in existence, yet they are also\nfrom another point of view the youngest. For it is only about twenty-five\nyears ago that Miss Frere began the modern collection of Indian folk-tales\nwith her charming, "Old Deccan Days" (London, John Murray, 1868; fourth\nedition, 1889). Her example has been followed by Miss Stokes, by Mrs. Steel,\nand Captain (now Major) Temple, by the Pandit Natesa Sastri, by Mr. Knowles\nand Mr. Campbell, as well as others who have published folk-tales in such\nperiodicals as the _Indian Antiquary_ and _The Orientalist._ The story-store\nof modern India has been well dipped into during the last quarter of a\ncentury, though the immense range of the country leaves room for any number of\nadditional workers and collections. Even so far as the materials already\ncollected go, a large number of the commonest incidents in European folk-tales\nhave been found in India. Whether brought there or born there, we have\nscarcely any criterion for judging; but as some of those still current among\nthe folk in India can be traced back more than a millennium, the presumption\nis in favour of an Indian origin.\n\nFrom all these sources--from the Jatakas, from the Bidpai, and from the more\nrecent collections--I have selected those stories which throw most light on\nthe origin of Fable and Folk-tales, and at the same time are most likely to\nattract English children. I have not, however, included too many stories of\nthe Grimm types, lest I should repeat the contents of the two preceding\nvolumes of this series. This has to some degree weakened the case for India as\nrepresented by this book. The need of catering for the young ones has\nrestricted my selection from the well-named "Ocean of the Streams of Story,"\n_Katha-Sarit Sagara_ of Somadeva. The stories existing in Pali and Sanskrit I\nhave taken from translations, mostly from the German of Benfey or the vigorous\nEnglish of Professor Rhys-Davids, whom I have to thank for permission to use\nhis versions of the Jatakas.\n\nI have been enabled to make this book a representative collection of the Fairy\nTales of Ind by the kindness of the original collectors or their publishers. I\nhave especially to thank Miss Frere, who kindly made an exception in my\nfavour, and granted me the use of that fine story, "Punchkin," and that quaint\nmyth, "How Sun, Moon, and Wind went out to Dinner." Miss Stokes has been\nequally gracious in granting me the use of characteristic specimens from her\n"Indian Fairy Tales." To Major Temple I owe the advantage of selecting from\nhis admirable _Wideawake Stories,_ and Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench & Co. have\nallowed me to use Mr. Knowles\' "Folk-tales of Kashmir," in their Oriental\nLibrary; and Messrs. W. H. Allen have been equally obliging with regard to\nMrs. Kingscote\'s "Tales ot the Sun." Mr. M. L. Dames has enabled me to add to\nthe published story-store of India by granting me the use of one from his\ninedited collection of Baluchi folk-tales.\n\nI have again to congratulate myself on the co-operation of my friend Mr. J. D.\nBatten in giving beautiful or amusing form to the creations of the folk fancy\nof the Hindoos. It is no slight thing to embody, as be has done, the glamour\nand the humour both of the Celt and of the Hindoo. It is only a further proof\nthat Fairy tales are something more than Celtic or Hindoo. They are human.\n\n\n\n\n\nJOSEPH JACOBS.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Lion and the Crane](ift02.htm)\n\n'
