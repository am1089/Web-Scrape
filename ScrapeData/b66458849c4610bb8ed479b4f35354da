And on account of the going of the pra _n_ as.\n\nScripture states that, when a new body is obtained, the pra _n_ as also go\n(from the old body to the new one). Cp. 'When he thus departs the (chief) pra\n_n_ a departs after him, and when the pra _n_ a thus departs all the other pra\n_n_ as depart after it' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 2), and similar passages. Now this\ngoing of the pra _n_ as is not possible without a base; hence we infer that\nwater also--mixed with parts of the other elements--goes (from the old body to\nthe new one), serving the purpose of supplying a base for the moving pra _n_\nas. For the pra _n_ as cannot, without such a base, either move or abide\nanywhere; as we observe in living beings.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 4](sbe38080.htm)\n\n"
