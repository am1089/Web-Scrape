Wilkins, [1900], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n##### CHAITANYA.\n\nChaitanya is believed by his followers to have been an incarnation of Vishnu;\nand as he lived in historical times, about 300 years ago, it is interesting to\nnotice\n\np. 254\n\nhow a human being came to be regarded as divine. He is worshipped in Nadiya in\nBengal, and it is a singular fact, that, at his shrine, there is a very small\nimage of Krishna, of whom he was a disciple and apostle, whilst the image of\nChaitanya is large and conspicuous. The Hindus who acknowledge this god say\nthat, amongst the many incarnations of Vishnu, four are most important. The\nfirst, in the Satya-yuga, called the Suklavarna (the white), was Ananta; the\nsecond, in the Treta-yuga, called the Raktavarna (the red), was that of\nKapiladeva; the third, in the Dw\xc4\x81rpara-yuga, called the Krishnavarna (the\nblack), was Krishna; and the last, in the K\xc4\x81li-yuga, called the Pitavarna (the\nyellow), was Chaitanya.\n\nThe founder of the sect, of which Chaitanya was the most illustrious member,\nwas a Br\xc4\x81hman named Adaitya, who lived at Santipore in Bengal. Another leader,\nnamed Nityananda, was born at Nadiya a short time before Chaitanya.\nChaitanya's father was a Br\xc4\x81hman, named Jagann\xc4\x81th Misra; his mother's name was\nSuchi; their first son, Visvambhara, was a religious mendicant. When their\nrenowned son was born, his mother was rather old; and as the child seemed\nweak, in accordance with a custom which prevailed in those times, he was hung\nin a basket on a tree to die. Adaitya happening to pass by the house at the\ntime, imagining that the child thus exposed might be the incarnation of deity\nhe was expecting, and which he had foretold, wrote with his foot on the soft\nearth the incantation employed at the initiation of a disciple into the\nmysteries of the worship of Krishna. The mother, impressed by this act, lifted\nthe child from the tree, who immediately took kindly to his food, which he had\nbefore neglected, and showed signs of strength and vigour.\n\np. 255\n\nChaitanya made great progress in learning. At sixteen he married Vishnupriy\xc4\x81,\nwith whom he lived until he was forty-four years of age, when he was persuaded\nby Adaitya and other mendicants to renounce his _poit \xc4\x81_ (Br\xc4\x81hmanical thread)\nand join them in their religious life. This was to lose his high position as a\nBr\xc4\x81hman. Leaving home, parents and wife, he removed to Benares, and many\nthought him guilty of a great crime in forsaking a large family that was\ndependent upon him for support. On his arrival at that city he began to teach\nthe doctrines of his sect and gathered many disciples. He called them\nVaishnavas--worshippers of Vishnu--and although his teaching was diametrically\nopposed in many important matters to orthodox Hinduism he was eminently\nsuccessful. Many who had formerly chiefly worshipped Siva and other deities,\nadopting his teaching, made Krishna the supreme. The main tenets of his\nteaching were these: That men should renounce a secular life, and spend their\ntime in visiting shrines; that they abandon the distinctions of caste, and eat\nfreely with all who joined their sect, whatever their caste might be; and that\nthey honour the name of Vishnu, and exercise _bhakti_ (or trust) in that god\nas the means of salvation. He allowed widows to remarry; forbade the eating of\nflesh and fish, and the worshipping of those deities to whom animal sacrifices\nwere offered; and further, that his disciples should not hold fellowship with\nthose who offered such sacrifices. It is a curious coincidence that about the\nsame time that Luther was preaching salvation by faith, in Europe, Chaitanya\nin India was giving prominence to the doctrine that salvation was to be\nobtained through faith ( _bhakti_ ) in Krishna.\n\nFrom Benares Chaitanya went to Puri, the great\n\np. 256\n\nshrine of Jagann\xc4\x81th, where he proclaimed his doctrines to the many pilgrims he\nmet there; and whilst there it is said that he obtained four additional arms.\nAdaitya and Nityananda, who had induced him to assume the position of leader,\nremained for some years in Benares doing similar work; but though they\nafterwards returned to the secular state, their descendants are greatly\nrespected by the members of this sect. It is reckoned that about one-fifth of\nthe Hindus of Bengal are followers of this teacher. Immoral women generally\nprofess to be his disciples. By their conduct they have excommunicated\nthemselves from orthodox Hindu society, and being outcasts cannot secure the\nproper performance of their funeral rites. As members of this casteless sect\nthese rites are not refused them.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Kamadeva](hmvp32.htm)\n\n"
