One of these observances was the recitation of the\nSavitri, a Vedic hymn to the Sun of wonderful beauty.'

Hence they mortified themselves to expiate sins, to\nacquire merits, and to obtain superhuman gifts and powers; the Gods themselves\nsometimes exercised themselves in such austerities, either to raise themselves\nto greater power and grandeur, or to counteract the austerities of man which\nthreatened to prevail over them and to deprive them of heaven.... Such\nausterities were called in India _tapas_ (burning ardour, fervent devotion)\nand he who practised them _tapasvin_.'GORRESIO.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXVI.: The Forest of Tadaka.](ry028.htm)\n\n"
