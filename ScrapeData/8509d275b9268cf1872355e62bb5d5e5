Verily, there was nothing here in the beginning: by Death this\n(universe) was covered, by hunger, for Death is hunger. He created for himself\nthis mind, thinking, 'May I have a soul.' He went on worshipping. Whilst he\nwas worshipping the waters were produced. 'Verily, to me worshipping (ar _k_ )\nwater (kam) has been produced,' thus (he thought): this, indeed, is the Arka-\nnature of the Arkya 1; and, verily, there is joy (kam) for him who thus knows\nthe Arka-nature of the Arkya.\n\n10:6:5:22\\. The Arka, doubtless, is the waters; and the cream (froth) which\nwas on the waters was compacted, and became this earth. Thereon he wearied\nhimself, and the glow and essence (sweat) of him thus wearied and heated\ndeveloped into Fire.\n\n10:6:5:33\\. He made himself threefold--(Agni being one-third), \xc3\x82ditya one-\nthird, and Vayu one-third: that is this threefold breath. The eastern quarter\nwas his head, this and that (intermediate quarters) are his fore-feet, the\nwestern quarter his tail, this and that (intermediate quarters) his thighs,\nthe southern and northern quarters his flanks; the sky his back, the air his\nbelly, and this (earth) his chest:--on the waters he was established any and\neverywhere, and so indeed is he established who knows this.\n\n10:6:5:44\\. He desired, 'May a second self be produced for me.' By his mind he\nentered into union with speech,--(to wit) Death with hunger: the seed which\nwas produced became the year, for theretofore there was no year. For as long\nas the year he (Death) carried him (within him), and at the end of\n\np. 403\n\nthat time he produced him 1. He opened his mouth (to devour) the new-born one,\nand he (the child) cried 'bha _n_ '; thus speech was produced.\n\n10:6:5:55\\. He bethought him, 'Surely, if I kill him, I shall gain but little\nfood 2.' By that speech and that soul of his he created all this (universe)\nwhatsoever there is,-- _Ri_ _k_ (hymn-verses), Ya _g_ us (formulas), Saman\n(hymn-tunes), metres, sacrifices, men, and beasts. And whatsoever he created\nhe set about devouring; and because he eats (ad) everything, hence the name\n'Aditi'; and, verily, he who thus knows the nature of Aditi becomes an eater\nof everything, and all food becomes his.\n\n10:6:5:66\\. He desired, 'May I again sacrifice by yet another sacrifice.' He\nwearied himself and practised austerity. From him, thus wearied and heated,\nglory and vigour departed; and glory and vigour, indeed, are the vital airs.\nThe vital airs having departed, that body of his began to swell. The mind was\nyet in the body;--\n\n10:6:5:77\\. He desired, 'May this (body) of mine be sacrificially pure: may I\nthereby be possessed of a self!' Thereupon the horse (a _s_ va) was produced;\nand because that which was swelling 3 (a _s_ vat) became pure (medhya)\ntherefore the name A _s_ vamedha (belongs to that sacrifice). He, indeed,\nknows the A _s_ vamedha who thus knows him 4.\n\np. 404\n\n10:6:5:88\\. He bethought him of leaving it unrestrained 1. At the end of a\nyear he slaughtered it for his own self, and made over the (sacrificial)\nanimals to the deities: therefore they slaughter the consecrated (victim) as\none that, in its nature as Pra _g_ apati, represents all the deities. But the\nA _s_ vamedha, in truth, is he that shines yonder (the sun), and the year is\nhis body. The Arka is this Fire, and these worlds are his bodies. These two\nare the Arka and A _s_ vamedha; but these, indeed, become again one deity, to\nwit, Death. And, verily, whosoever knows this, conquers recurrent Death, and\nDeath has no hold on him: Death is his own self; he attains all life, and\nbecomes one of those deities.\n\n10:6:5:99\\. Now the line of succession (of teachers). The same as far as Sa\n_m_ _g_ iviputra. Sa _m_ _g_ iviputra (received it) from Ma _n_ _d_ ukayani,\nMa _n_ _d_ ukayani from Ma _n_ davya, Ma _n_ davya from Kautsa, Kautsa from\nMahitthi, Mahitthi from Vamakakshaya _n_ a, Vamakakshaya _n_ a from Vatsya,\nVatsya from _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya, _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya from Ku _s_ ri, Ku _s_ ri\nfrom Yag _\xc3\xb1_ ava _k_ as Ra _g_ astambayana, Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ava _k_ as Ra _g_\nastambayana from Tura Kavasheya, Tura Kavasheya from Pra _g_ apati, Pra _g_\napati from Brahman (n.). Brahman is the self-existent: reverence be to\nBrahman!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[402:1](sbe4375.htm#fr_831) See [X, 3, 4, 3](sbe4359.htm#10:3:4:3) seq.; [4,\n1, 4](sbe4361.htm#10:4:1:4).
