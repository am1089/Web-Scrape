Or (the passage rather is) an injunction, as in the case of the carrying\n(of the firewood).\n\np. 299\n\nOr the passage is rather to be understood as containing an injunction, not a\nmere reference.--But, an objection is raised, if we assume it to be an\ninjunction we thereby oppose the conception of the entire passage as a\ncoherent whole, while yet the passage has clearly to be conceived as\nconstituting such a whole, viz. as meaning that while the three branches of\nthe law have for their result the world of the blessed, the condition of being\ngrounded in Brahman has immortality for its result.--True, but all the same we\nmust set aside the conception of the passage as a whole--well founded as it is\n--and assume it to be an injunction. For it is a new injunction because no\nother injunction is observed, and as the conception of the other stage of life\nclearly arises from the passage it is impossible to interpret it as a coherent\nwhole by means of the assumption that it is a mere gu _n_ avada 1.\n\nThe case is analogous to that of the 'carrying.' There is a scriptural text\n(relating to the Agnihotra which forms part of the mahapit _ri_ ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a),\n'Let him approach carrying the firewood below (the ladle holding the\noffering); for above he carries it for the gods.' Now this passage may be\nconceived as an unbroken whole if we view it as referring to the carrying\nbelow only; nevertheless we determine that it enjoins the carrying above\nbecause that\n\np. 300\n\nis not enjoined anywhere else 1. This is explained in the chapter treating of\n'complement,' in the Sutra, 'But it is an injunction,' &c. (Pu. Mim. Su.). In\nthe same way we assume that our passage referring to the different a _s_ ramas\nis an injunctory passage only.\n\nEven if (to state an alternative conclusion) the passage contains references\nonly to the other a _s_ ramas, it must be viewed as enjoining at any rate the\ncondition of being grounded in Brahman, owing to the glorification of that\ncondition. The question here arises whether that state belongs to any one\ncomprised within the four a _s_ ramas, or only to the wandering mendicant. If\nnow a reference to the mendicant also is contained within the references to\nthe a _s_ ramas up to the Brahma _k_ arin (i.e. the three a _s_ ramas the text\nrefers to before the passage about the brahmasa _m_ stha); then, as all four a\n_s_ ramas are referred to equally and as somebody not belonging to any a _s_\nrama could not possibly be called brahmasa _m_ stha, it follows that the term\n'brahmasa _m_ stha' denotes any one standing within one of the four a _s_\nramas. If, on the other hand, the mendicant is not comprised within the\nreferences to the three a _s_ ramas, he alone remains, and this establishes\nthe conclusion that the brahmasa _m_ stha is the mendicant only. (We therefore\nhave to inquire which of the two alternatives stated has to be adopted.)--Here\nsome maintain that the term 'austerity' which denotes the hermit in the woods\nimplies a reference to the mendicant also. But this is wrong. For as long as\nany other explanation is possible, we must not assume that a term which\nexpresses a distinctive attribute of the hermits living in the forest\ncomprises the wandering mendicants also. Both the Brahma _k_ arin and the\nhouseholder are\n\np. 301\n\nreferred to by distinctive terms applying to them only, and we therefore\nexpect that the mendicant and the hermit also should be referred to by\nanalogous terms. Now 'austerity' is a distinctive attribute of the hermits\nliving in the woods; for the principal conventional meaning of the word\n'austerity' is mortification of the body. The distinctive attribute of the\nmendicant, on the other hand, viz. restraint of the senses and so on, cannot\nbe denoted by the term 'austerity.' Moreover it would be an illegitimate\nassumption that the a _s_ ramas which are known to be four should here be\nreferred to as three. And further the text notifies a distinction, viz. by\nsaying that those three reach the world of the blessed, while one enjoys\nimmortality. Now there is room for such a distinction if the hermits and the\nmendicants are separate; for we do not say 'Devadatta and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ adatta\nare stupid, but one of them is clever,' but we say 'Devadatta and Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nadatta are stupid, but Vish _n_ umitra is clever.' The passage therefore has\nto be understood in that sense, that those belonging to the three former a _s_\nramas obtain the world of the blessed, while the remaining one, i.e. the\nwandering mendicant, enjoys immortality.--But how can the term 'brahmasa _m_\nstha,' which according to its etymological meaning may be applied to members\nof all a _s_ ramas, be restricted to the mendicant? and, if we agree to take\nit in its conventional meaning, it follows that immortality may be reached by\nmerely belonging to an a _s_ rama, and hence that knowledge is useless!--To\nthese objections we make the following reply. The term 'brahmasa _m_ stha'\ndenotes fulfilment in Brahman, a state of being grounded in Brahman to the\nexclusion of all other activity. Now such a state is impossible for persons\nbelonging to the three former a _s_ ramas, as scripture declares that they\nsuffer loss through the non-performance of the works enjoined on their a _s_\nrama. The mendicant, on the other hand, who has discarded all works can suffer\nno loss owing to non-performance. Such duties as are incumbent on him, viz.\nrestraint of the senses and the like, arc not opposed to the state of being\ngrounded in Brahman, but rather helpful\n\np. 302\n\nto it. For the only work enjoined on him by his a _s_ rama. is the state of\nbeing firmly grounded in Brahman, wherein he is strengthened by restraint of\nthe senses and so on--just as sacrifices and the like are prescribed for the\nother a _s_ ramas--and loss he incurs only by neglecting that work. In\nagreement herewith texts from scripture and Sm _ri_ ti declare that for him\nwho is grounded in Brahman there are no works. Compare 'Renunciation is\nBrahman; for Brahman is the highest; for the highest is Brahman; above those\nlower penances, indeed, there rises renunciation;' 'Those anchorites who have\nwell ascertained the object of the knowledge of the Vedanta and have purified\ntheir nature by the Yoga of renunciation' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 6); and similar\nscriptural passages. And Sm _ri_ ti-texts to the same effect, such as 'They\nwhose minds are fixed on him, who have their Self in him, their stand on him,\ntheir end in him' (Bha. Gita V, 17). All these passages teach that for him who\nis founded on Brahman there are no works. From this there also follows the\nnon-validity of the second objection raised above, viz. that the mendicant's\nreaching immortality through the mere stage of life in which he stands would\nimply the uselessness of knowledge.--In this way we understand that, although\nthere is a reference to the other stages of life, that which is indicated by\nthe quality of being grounded in Brahman is the state of the wandering\nmendicant.\n\nThis whole discussion has been carried on by the teacher without taking into\naccount the text of the _G_ abalas, which enjoins the other stage of life. But\nthere exists that text which directly enjoins the other stage, 'Having\ncompleted his studentship he is to become a householder; having been a\nhouseholder he is to become a dweller in the forest; having been a dweller in\nthe forest he is to wander forth; or else he may wander forth from the\nstudent's state; or from the house; or from the forest.' Nor can this text be\ninterpreted as referring to those who are not qualified for works; for it\nstates no difference, and there is a separate injunction (of the parivra _g_\nya-state) for those who are not qualified, viz. in the passage, 'May he have\n\np. 303\n\ntaken vows upon himself or not, may he be a snataka or not, may he be one\nwhose fire has gone out or one who has no fire,' &c. That the text does not\nrefer to such only as are not qualified for works, further follows from the\nfact that the state of the mendicant is meant to subserve the development of\nthe knowledge of Brahman 1, as scripture declares, 'The wandering mendicant,\nwith colourless dress, shaven, wifeless, pure, guileless, living on alms,\nqualifies himself for the intuition of Brahman.'--From all this it follows\nthat the stages of life for which chastity is obligatory are established by\nscripture, and that knowledge--because enjoined on persons who have entered on\nthose stages--is independent of works.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[299:1](sbe38229.htm#fr_192) In the clause 'vidhyantaradar _s_ arnat' I can\nsee nothing more than an explanation of--or reason for--the 'apurvatvat.' If\nwe viewed the passage as glorifying the brahmasa _m_ sthata compared to the\nthree branches of the law through the statement of its super-sensuous results\n(so that it would constitute an arthavada of the kind called gu _n_ avada), we\nshould indeed preserve the unity of the passage--which is destroyed if we view\nit as enjoining the different stages of life. But all the same the latter\nexplanation is the true one; for a glorificatory passage presupposes an\ninjunctive one, and as no such injunctive passage is met with elsewhere, it is\nsimpler to assume that the present passage is itself injunctive than to\nconstrue (on the basis of it if viewed as a gu _n_ avada) another injunctive\npassage. (In \xc3\x82nanda Giri's gloss on this passage--Biblioth. Indica edition--\nread 'vihitatvopagamaprasaktya' and 'stutilaksha _n_ ayaika\xc2\xb0.')\n\n[300:1](sbe38229.htm#fr_193) The ekavakyata is preserved if we take the clause\nfrom 'above' as an arthavada meant to give the reason why in sacrifices\noffered to the Fathers the firewood has to be carried below. Nevertheless the\nclause must be taken as a vidhi enjoining the carrying above in all sacrifices\noffered to the gods, because this particular is not enjoined elsewhere.\n\n[303:1](sbe38229.htm#fr_194) Which has to be acquired in the regular\nproscribed way of Brahmanical studentship.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 21](sbe38230.htm)\n\n"
