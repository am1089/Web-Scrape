On the attainment of this, there result the non-clinging and the\ndestruction of later and earlier sins; this being declared.\n\nHaving, so far, elucidated the nature of meditation, the Sutras now begin to\nconsider the result of meditation. Scripture declares that on the knowledge of\nBrahman being attained a man's later and earlier sins do not cling to him but\npass away. 'As water does not cling to a lotus leaf, so no evil deed clings to\nhim who knows this ' ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 14, 3); ' Having known that he is not\nsullied by any evil deed ' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 23); ' As the fibres of the\nIshika reed when thrown into the fire are burnt, thus all his sins are burnt'\n( _Kh_. Up. V, 24, 3); 'All his works perish when He has been beheld who is\nhigh and low' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8).--The doubt here arises whether this non-\nclinging and destruction of all sins is possible as the result of mere\nmeditation, or not.--It is not possible, the Purvapakshin maintains; for\nScripture declares, 'no work the fruits of which have not been completely\nenjoyed perishes even in millions of aeons.' What the texts, quoted above, say\nas to the non-clinging and destruction of works occurs in sections\ncomplementary to passages inculcating knowledge as the means of final Release,\nand may therefore be understood as somehow meant to eulogize knowledge. Nor\ncan it be said that knowledge is enjoined as an expiation of sins, so that the\ndestruction of sins could be conceived as resulting from such expiation; for\nknowledge--as we see from texts such as 'He who knows Brahman reaches the\nHighest,' 'He knows Brahman and he becomes Brahman'--is enjoined as a means to\nreach Brahman. The texts as to the non-clinging and destruction of sins\ntherefore can only be viewed as arthavada passages supplementary to the texts\nenjoining knowledge of Brahman.--This view the Sutra sets aside. When a man\nreaches knowledge, the non-clinging and destruction of all sins may be\neffected through the power of knowledge. For Scripture declares the power\n\np. 723\n\nof knowledge to be such that 'to him who knows this, no evil deed clings,' and\nso on. Nor is this in conflict with the text stating that no work not fully\nenjoyed perishes; for this latter text aims at confirming the power of works\nto produce their results; while the texts under discussion have for their aim\nto declare that knowledge when once sprung up possesses the power of\ndestroying the capability of previously committed sins to produce their own\nevil results and the power of obstructing that capability on the part of\nfuture evil actions. The two sets of texts thus refer to different matters,\nand hence are not mutually contradictory. There is in fact no more\ncontradiction between them than there is between the power of fire to produce\nheat and the power of water to subdue such heat. By knowledge effecting the\nnon-clinging of sin we have to understand its obstructing the origination of\nthe power, on the part of sin, to cause that disastrous disposition on the\npart of man which consists in unfitness for religious works; for sins\ncommitted tend to render man unfit for religious works and inclined to commit\nfurther sinful actions of the same kind. By knowledge effecting the\ndestruction of sin, on the other hand, we understand its destroying that power\nof sin after it has once originated. That power consists, fundamentally, in\ndispleasure on the part of the Lord. Knowledge of the Lord, which, owing to\nthe supreme dearness of its object is itself supremely dear, possesses the\ncharacteristic power of propitiating the Lord--the object of knowledge--and\nthus destroys the displeasure of the Lord due to the previous commission of\nsins on the part of the knowing Devotee; and at the same time obstructs the\norigination of further displeasure on the Lord's part, which otherwise would\nbe caused by sins committed subsequently to the origination of such knowledge.\nWhat Scripture says about sin not clinging to him who knows can however be\nunderstood only with regard to such sins as spring from thoughtlessness; for\ntexts such as 'he who has not turned away from evil conduct' (Ka. Up. I, 2,\n24) teach that meditation, becoming more perfect day after day, cannot be\naccomplished without the Devotee having previously broken\n\np. 724\n\nhimself off from all evil conduct.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'the\nreaching of that.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 14.
