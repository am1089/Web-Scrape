At the Agnish _t_ oma (Saman 3) he seizes a (victim) for Agni, for\nthe Agnish _t_ oma (i.e. 'Agni's\n\np. 12\n\npraise 1) is Agni: he thereby wins Agni. For the Ukthas 2 he seizes one for\nIndra and Agni; for the hymns (uktha) relate to Indra and Agni 3: the hymns he\nthereby wins. For the Sho _d_ a _s_ i n he seizes one for Indra; for the Sho\n_d_ a _s_ in is Indra: the Sho _d_ a _s_ in (Indra) he thereby wins.\n\n5:1:3:22\\. For the seventeenth (or seventeenfold) stotra 4 he seizes one for\nSarasvati: thereby, while there is no over-night performance 5, it is yet made\nlike the night (performance); for he who offers the Va _g_ apeya\n\np. 13\n\nwins Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati is the year: by that (victim) for\nSarasvati he now wins the night: hence, while there is no night performance,\nit is made like the night.\n\n5:1:3:33\\. Thereupon he seizes a spotted sterile cow for the Victorious\nMaruts; for the spotted sterile cow is this (earth): whatever food, rooted and\nrootless, is here established on her, thereby she is a spotted cow. Now, he\nwho offers the Va _g_ apeya wins food, for va _g_ a-peya 1 doubtless means the\nsame as anna-peya (food and drink); and the Maruts are the peasants, and the\npeasants are food (for the noble). 'To the Victorious (Maruts)!' he says, even\nfor the sake of victory. It is difficult to obtain an invitatory and offering\nprayer containing the word 'victorious:' if he should be unable to obtain such\nas contain the word 'victorious,' any other two verses to the Maruts will do.\nDifficult to obtain also is a spotted sterile cow: if he cannot obtain a\nspotted sterile cow, any other sterile cow will do.\n\n5:1:3:44\\. The course of procedure thereof (is as follows). When the Hot _ri_\nrecites after the Mahendra libation, then let them proceed with (the offering\nof) her omentum, for that, the Mahendra 2, is Indra's special (nishkevalya)\nlibation; and his also are the Nishkevalya-stotra and Nishkevalya- _s_ astra.\nNow the sacrificer is Indra: thus he thereby puts strength into the sacrificer\nin the very middle (of the sacrifice):\n\np. 14\n\nthat is why they should proceed with her omentum at that particular time.\n\n5:1:3:55\\. They cook the portions 1 in two lots. Of the one lot thereof, after\nmaking an 'under-layer' of ghee (clarified butter) in the _g_ uhu spoon, he\nmakes two cuttings from each (portion), bastes them once, and replenishes with\nghee (the empty places of) the cuttings. Thereupon he makes one cutting from\neach into the upabh _ri_ t spoon, bastes them twice, but does not replenish\n(the places of) the cuttings. Now, when of the one lot (of portions) he makes\ntwo cuttings from each, thereby that (sterile cow) becomes whole; and when he\nproceeds with those (portions), thereby he wins the divine race. He then\npresents the (other) half to the human kind: and thereby he wins the human\nkind (people, vi _s_ ).\n\n5:1:3:66\\. But let him not do it in this wise; for verily he who departs from\nthe path of the sacrifice, stumbles; and he who does it in this wise certainly\ndeparts from the path of the sacrifice. Hence when they proceed with the\nomenta of the other victims, only then let them proceed with the omentum of\nthat (cow). They cook the portions in one lot, and do not present any to the\nhuman kind.\n\n5:1:3:77\\. He then seizes seventeen victims for Pra _g_ apati. They are all\nhornless, all dark-grey 2, all (uncastrated) males; for he who offers the Va\n_g_ apeya, wins Pra _g_ apati; but Pra _g_ apati is food, and the victim\n(cattle) is food: he thus wins Pra _g_ apati. And Pra _g_ apati is Soma, and\nthe victim is the visible\n\np. 15\n\n[paragraph continues] Soma: he thus wins the visible Pra _g_ apati. There are\nseventeen (victims), because Pra _g_ apati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra\n_g_ apati.\n\n5:1:3:88\\. Now, they are all hornless;--for man is nearest to Pra _g_ apati,\nand he is hornless, unhorned; and Pra _g_ apati also is hornless, unhorned;\nand these (victims) belong to Pra _g_ apati: therefore they are all hornless.\n\n5:1:3:99\\. They are all dark-grey. Now, the dark-grey has two forms, the light\nhair and the black; and a couple means a productive pair, and Pra _g_ apati\n(the lord of generation) represents productiveness, and those (victims) belong\nto Pra _g_ apati: therefore they are all dark-grey.\n\n5:1:3:1010\\. They are all males;--for the male means productiveness, and Pra\n_g_ apati represents productiveness: hence they are all males. Difficult to\nobtain are victims with these perfections: if he cannot obtain them (all) with\nthese perfections, even some with these perfections will do; for verily Pra\n_g_ apati is everything here.\n\n5:1:3:1111\\. Now, some seize the last (victim) for Va _k_ (Speech), thinking,\n'If there be anything beyond Pra _g_ apati, that is Speech: we thus win\nSpeech.' But let him not do it in this wise; for Pra _g_ apati is everything\nhere,--these worlds and everything there is;--whatever speech speaks in these\nworlds, that speech he wins: therefore he need not heed this.\n\n5:1:3:1212\\. The course of procedure regarding these (victims is as follows).\nWhen the Maitravaru _n_ a recites after the Vamadevya 1, let them then proceed\n\np. 16\n\nwith their omenta; for the Vamadevya means productiveness, and Pra _g_ apati\nmeans productiveness, and these (victims) belong to Pra _g_ apati: therefore\nlet them proceed with their omenta at that time.\n\n5:1:3:1313\\. And (when) the after-offerings have been performed, and the\nspoons have not yet been shifted (separated) 1, then they proceed with the\n(chief) oblations of those (victims). That (point in the performance) is the\nend, and Pra _g_ apati is the end: thus he wins Pra _g_ apati at the very end.\nBut were he to proceed therewith sooner, it would be just as if a man had\nalready gone the way he still intends to go,--and where would he be after that\n2?--therefore\n\np. 17\n\nthey proceed with their (chief) oblations at that time.\n\n5:1:3:1414\\. But let him not do it in this wise for he who departs from the\npath of the sacrifice stumbles; and he who does it in this wise certainly\ndeparts from the path of the sacrifice. Hence whenever they proceed with the\nomenta of the other victims, let them at the same time proceed with the omenta\nof these; and whenever they proceed with the (chief) oblations of the other\nvictims, let them at the same time proceed with the oblations of these. There\nis but one invitatory prayer, and one offering prayer; for (these offerings)\nbelong to one deity. He says (to the Maitravaru _n_ a), 'To Pra _g_ apati'--\nsaying this (name) in a low voice--'recite the invitatory prayer for the\noffering of the bucks!'--'To Pra _g_ apati' saying this in a low voice--'urge\nthe ready-standing offering of the bucks!' and as the Vasha _t_ is uttered, he\nmakes the offering.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[11:3](sbe4105.htm#fr_45) Of the seven fundamental forms (sa _m_ stha) of\nSoma-sacrifice, each higher, or more complex, form is obtained by some\nadditional ceremony, or ceremonies, being added on to one of the simpler forms\nof sacrifice. In the present paragraph, the author briefly reviews the lower\nforms of Soma-sacrifice, contained in the Va _g_ apeya, p. 12 with the view of\nenumerating the victims to be slaughtered at its performance; viz. the Agnish\n_t_ oma with twelve chants and one victim; the Ukthya with fifteen stotras and\ntwo victims; and the Sho _d_ a _s_ in with sixteen chants and three victims.\nFor further particulars, see part ii, p. 397, note 2.\n\n[12:1](sbe4105.htm#fr_46) The Agnish _t_ oma-saman, the last (twelfth) and\ndistinctive stotra of the Agnish _t_ oma sacrifice, is in praise of Agni (see\npart ii, p. 368, note 2). At the Va _g_ apeya the ordinary (ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ aya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ \xc5\xb7a) hymn is not chanted, but S.V. II, 973-4, sung to the Varavantiya tune\n(Calc. ed., vol. v, p. 144), takes its place. Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_. Br. 18, 6, 16.\n\n[12:2](sbe4105.htm#fr_47) The three Uktha stotras (chants) and _s_ astras\n(recitations) constitute the distinctive element of the Ukthya sacrifice; as\nthe Sho _d_ a _s_ i-stotra and _s_ astra (part ii, p. 401, note 3; p. 402,\nnote i) constitute that of the Sho _d_ a _s_ in sacrifice.\n\n[12:3](sbe4105.htm#fr_48) On the important place assigned to these two deities\nin the traditional arrangement of the Rigveda-sa _m_ hita, see the\nintroduction to part i, p. xvi.\n\n[12:4](sbe4105.htm#fr_49) That is the Va _g_ apeya-saman, see note\n[1](sbe4104.htm#fn_43), [p. 11](sbe4104.htm#page_11).\n\n[12:5](sbe4105.htm#fr_50) The author here alludes to another form of Soma-\nsacrifice, not contained in the Va _g_ apeya, viz. the Atiratra, which is\nobtained by following up the Sho _d_ a _s_ in (with its sixteen chants) with\nthe so-called ratri-paryaya _h_ , or night-rounds, consisting of three rounds\nof four chants each, or together twelve chants. These are succeeded, at day-\nbreak, by the Sandhi-stotra (or twilight chants), consisting of three chants.\nAlthough this night performance does not take place on the present occasion--\nthe Va _g_ apeya-saman taking its place--the author claims for this form of\nsacrifice also the moral benefits which would accrue to the sacrificer from\nthe Atiratra, for the reason that the same victim (a be-goat for Sarasvati) is\noffered on both occasions.\n\n[13:1](sbe4105.htm#fr_51) In Taitt. Br. I, 3, 2, 3, on the other hand, va _g_\napeya (which doubtless means 'drink of strength') is explained first by va _g_\napya, 'that through which the gods wished to obtain (aipsan) strength (va _g_\nam),' and then by 'drink of strength,' i.e. Soma 'by drinking (pitva) which\none becomes strong (va _g_ in).'\n\n[13:2](sbe4105.htm#fr_52) For this libation, and the accompanying Nishkevalya-\n_s_ astra, at the midday Soma-feast, see part ii, pp. 338, 339, note 2.\n\n[14:1](sbe4105.htm#fr_53) For particulars regarding the meat portions, see\npart ii, p. 204 seq.\n\n[14:2](sbe4105.htm#fr_54) Or, black and white ( _s_ ukla-k _ri_ sh _n_ a-var\n_n_ a), as ' _s_ yama' is explained by Saya _n_ a.\n\n[15:1](sbe4105.htm#fr_55) The Vamadevya-saman (Samav. II, 32-34) is the second\nP _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra, after the chanting of which, at the midday feast, p.\n16 the first assistant of the Hot _ri_ , the Maitravaru _n_ a, has to recite\nhis (the second) Nishkevalya- _s_ astra; see part ii, p. 325, note 2; p. 339,\nnote 2.--As regards the Hot _ri_ 's P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotra, the Rathantara-\nsaman (S. V. II, 30, 31) is used for it; while the Abhivarta tune (S. V. ed.\nBibl. Ind. III, p. 93) is employed in the chanting of the Brahma-saman (S. V.\nII, 35, 36; see part ii, p. 434, note I) instead of the ordinary Naudhasa\ntune. Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_. Br. 18, 6, 11-14.\n\n[16:1](sbe4105.htm#fr_56) On this ceremony with which the concluding rites of\nthe ish _t_ i commence, see I, 8, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[16:2](sbe4105.htm#fr_57) Or possibly, what would then become of him? The\nauthor's reasoning seems to be that, if the sacrificer were to offer any of\nthe chief oblations at an earlier point in the performance, he would thereby\nanticipate the results he wants to obtain from the whole performance,--or, so\nto speak, he would then already reach the goal for the attainment of which the\nsubsequent oblations are likewise intended. For the same reason the offering\nof the omentum of the sterile cow, previously to and independently of the\nomenta of the other victims, was discountenanced in paragraph\n[6](sbe4105.htm#5:1:3:6). Our present passage is interpreted rather\ndifferently by Professor Delbruck in his Altindische Syntax, p. 550:--Wenn er\nvorher damit vorginge, so ware das so, als ob er, nach Betretung des Pfades,\nden er zu betreten beabsichtigt, wo? ware (d. h. in's Ungluck geriethe): 'Were\nhe to proceed therewith sooner, it would be just as if, after entering on the\npath he intends to enter upon, he would be where? (i.e. would get into\ntrouble).'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 1, 4. Fourth Brahma _n_ a](sbe4106.htm)\n\n"
