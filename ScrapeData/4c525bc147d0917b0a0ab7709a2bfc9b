He has brought down (i. e. surpassed) the wisdom of many a worshipper\n[1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:1:1), he who holds in his hand all manly power. Agni\nhas become the lord of treasures, he who brought together all (powers of)\nimmortality.\n\n2 [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:2:1). All the clever immortals when seeking did not\nfind the calf though sojourning round about us. The attentive (gods), wearying\nthemselves, following his footsteps [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:2:2), stood at\nthe highest, beautiful [3](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:2:3) standing-place of Agni.\n\n3\\. When the bright ones [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:3:1) had done service\n[2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:3:2) to thee, the bright one, Agni, with Gh _ri_ ta\nthrough three autumns, they assumed worshipful names; the well-born shaped\ntheir own bodies.\n\n4\\. Acquiring (or, exploring?) for themselves the two great worlds, the\nworshipful ones brought forward their Rudra-like powers\n[1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:4:1). The mortal, when (beings) were in discord\n[2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:4:2), perceived and found out Agni standing in the\nhighest place.\n\n5\\. Being like-minded they [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:1) reverentially\napproached him on their knees. Together with their wives they venerated the\nvenerable one [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:2). Abandoning their bodies they made\nthem their own [3](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:3), the (one) friend waking when the\n(other) friend closed his eyes [4](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:4).\n\n6\\. When the worshipful (gods) have discovered the thrice seven secret steps\n[1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:6:1) (or, places) laid down in thee, they\nconcordantly guard with them immortality.\n\np. 83\n\n[paragraph continues] Protect thou the cattle and that which remains steadfast\n[2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:6:2) and that which moves.\n\n7\\. Knowing, O Agni, the established orders [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:7:1) of\n(human) dwellings, distribute in due order gifts [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:7:2)\nthat they may live. Knowing the ways which the gods go\n[3](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:7:3), thou hast become the unwearied messenger, the\nbearer of oblations.\n\n8\\. They who knew the right way and were filled with good intentions, beheld\nfrom heaven the seven young [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:8:1) (rivers) and the\ndoors of riches. Sarama found the strong stable of the cows from which human\nclans receive their nourishment [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:8:2).\n\n9\\. The Earth has spread herself far and wide with them who are great in their\ngreatness, the mother Aditi, for the refreshment of the bird\n[1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:9:1), with her sons who have assumed all powers of\ntheir own dominion [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:9:2), preparing (for themselves)\nthe way to immortality.\n\n10\\. When the immortals created the two eyes of heaven\n[1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:1), they placed fair splendour in him (Agni)\n[2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:2). Then they rush down\n[3](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:3) like streams let loose. The red ones have\nrecognised, O Agni, those which are directed downwards\n[4](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:4).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 1 = TS. II, 2, 12, 1. Verse 3 = TB. II, 4,\n5, 6. Verses 8-9 = TB. II, 5, 8, 10.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The meaning seems to me to be: by his wisdom he excels all human\nwisdom. Prof. Max Muller translates: 'Agni, who holds in his hand all that men\ndesire, conquers\n\np. 84\n\n[paragraph continues] (or, wins for himself) the praises of many a wise\nworshipper.' And the last Pada: 'he who brought together all immortal\nblessings.'--On _s_ a _s_ vat, see VI, 61, 1; VII, 18, 18; VIII, 23, 28.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Here we have again the myth of the hidden Agni whom the gods seek.\nAgni is meant by the calf.\n\nNote 2. Going on foot, Saya _n_ a.\n\nNote 3. I follow Saya _n_ a, Bollensen, and Ludwig in taking _k_ a\xc2\xb4ru as a\nlocative.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. 'Was not Saya _n_ a right in taking this verse as referring to the\nMaruts? Cf. VI, 48, 21.\xe2\x80\xa6 su _g_ ata also is an epithet of the Maruts, I, 88,\n3; 166, 12.' M. M.\n\nNote 2. As to the subjunctive, comp. Delbruck, Syntaktische Forschungen, I, p.\n67. The Taittiriya Brahma _n_ a (II, 4, 5, 6) reads saparyan.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. I follow the Padapa _th_ a which has rudriya. But possibly we may have\nthe nom. plur. rudriya _h_ : 'the worshipful Rudriyas (i. e. Maruts) rushed\nforward.'\n\nNote 2. The translation of nemadhita is in jeopardy.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Probably the mortals, as Ludwig understands it. Comp. marta _h_ ,\nverse 4.\n\nNote 2. The venerable one is Agni.\n\nNote 3. Possibly the text is corrupt. In IV, 24, 3 we read ririkva\xc2\xb4 _m_ sa _h_\ntanv\xcc\x83a _h_ k _ri_ _n_ vata tra\xc2\xb4m, 'abandoning (i. e. risking) their bodies\nthey took him (Indra) for their protector' (comp. I, 100, 7). Should sva\xc2\xb4 _h_\nhave supplanted another word, for instance, tra\xc2\xb4m? As the pronoun sva very\nfrequently stands in apposition with tanu\xc2\xb4, it may have found its way also\ninto passages to which it did not belong.\n\np. 85\n\nNote 4. The meaning seems to be that whenever the attention of one of the\nfriends relaxed, another friend watched instead of the first. See Zeitschrift\nder Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XLIV, 328; Bartholomae, Studien zur\nindogerm. Sprachgeschichte, I, 95.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Saya _n_ a explains the tri _h_ sapta pada\xc2\xb4 as the three times seven\nkinds of sacrifices, the seven Pakaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, the seven Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\nas, the seven Somaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as. But this later system of the twenty-one forms\nof sacrifice can scarcely have existed at the time of the Rig-veda Sa _m_\nhita. Three times seven is a favourite number in Rig-vedic mysticism; comp. I,\n191, 12. 14; IV, 1, 16; VII, 87, 4; VIII, 46, 26; 69, 7; 96, 2; IX, 70, 1; 86,\n21; X, 64, 8; 90, 15: Possibly three times seven pieces of wood (samidha _h_ )\nare alluded to, comp. X, 90, 15, but everybody who has studied Bergaigne's\nArithmetique mythologique (Rel. Ved. II, 114 seq.; see especially p. 122) will\nadmit that there are ever so many possible interpretations of a passage like\nthis. Prof. Max Muller's translation is: 'The worshipful gods found in thee\nthe twenty-one words which are hidden in thee. They guard with them the\nimmortal (Agni).'--Instead of avidan (Padapa _th_ a) I think we must read\navidan.\n\nNote 2. Ludwig certainly is wrong in translating 'hute du den wandel von tier\nand pflanze.' The author of this group of hymns is very fond of the phrase\nsthatu _h_ _k_ aratham and the like; see I, 68, 1; 70, 3. 7. Tire same phrase,\nin one or the other of its possible shapes, has evidently been used by him\nhere also. The plural masculine sthat _r i\xc2\xb4_ _n_ is indeed very strange.\nPossibly J. Wackernagel is right in reading sthat _r i\xc2\xb4_n (Kuhn's Zeitschrift,\nXXV, 287; comp. Lanman, p. 422); the reading sthat _r i\xc2\xb4_ _n_ may be due to\nthe neighbourhood of pa _s_ u\xc2\xb4n. This sort of blunder is very frequent in the\ntext of the Rig-veda. Prof. Max Muller suggests: the stabled cattle and what\nmoves about (in the meadows).\n\np. 86\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. On vayuna, comp. Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 295. 300. 'The thoughts of\nhuman beings.' M. M.\n\nNote 2. _S_ urudh: Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 32. 50.\n\nNote 3. 'Which lead to the gods?' M. M.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Comp. I, 26, 10, note 1.--'Beheld the seven young rivers coming down\nfrom heaven.' M. M.\n\nNote 2. See Delbruck, Syntaktische Forschungen, I, 87.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. The bird seems to be Agni.\n\nNote 2. The Padapa _th_ a gives su-apatya\xc2\xb4ni. There is no doubt a word su-\napatya, 'blessed with good offspring.' This is frequently used together with\nsuch nouns as rayi, kshaya, ish; it stands in several passages by the side of\npra _g_ avat. See I, 117, 19; II, 2, 12; 4, 8; 9, 5; III, 3, 7; 16, 1; IV, 2,\n11; X, 30, 12. But from this word should be distinguished sva-patya, derived\nfrom sva-pati (X, 44, 1, &c.), 'a man's own dominion,' or 'own rulership;'\ncomp. _g_ aspatya. This word is found here, and in some other passages, for\ninstance, VII, 91, 3. vi _s_ va it nara _h_ svapatya\xc2\xb4ni _k_ akru _h_ , 'the\nheroes have exercised all the powers of their own dominion;' VIII, 15, 10.\nsatra\xc2\xb4 vi _s_ va svapatya\xc2\xb4ni dadhishe, 'thou hast assumed (Indra) all powers\nof thy own dominion altogether.'--Ludwig translates correctly, 'alle\nselbstherlichkeit.'\n\nThe Taittiriya Brahma _n_ a reads _k_ akru _h_ for tasthu _h_. This reading\nevidently rests on Rig-veda IV, 34, 9; VII, 91, 3. There is no reason,\nhowever, for preferring this to the traditional reading of our Rik-text.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. The sun and the moon? This very natural explanation will scarcely be\nmodified on account of passages like the following ( _S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a\nI, 6, 3, 38):\n\np. 87\n\n[paragraph continues] 'These are the two eyes of the sacrifice, the (oblations\nof butter called) \xc3\x82 _g_ yabhagas.'\n\nNote 2. Comp. below, 73, 4.\n\nNote 3. It is not necessary to change the text; I believe, however, that the\nconjecture adha _h_ ksharanti (they stream downwards) would not be quite\nimprobable. Comp. my Prolegomena, p. 369, note 1.--The subject seems to be the\nstreams of sacrificial libations.\n\nNote 4. Both expressions, 'the red ones' and 'those which are directed\ndownwards,' are feminine. The red ones may be the dawns. But these cannot be\ncalled 'directed downwards.' I take, therefore, the one noun as a nominative,\nthe other as an accusative. Cannot 'those which are directed downwards' be the\nlibations of Gh _ri_ ta and the like, which the dawns see?--Prof. Max Muller\ntranslates: 'People recognised the red netherward mares (of thee), O Agni.' He\nsupplies _g_ vala _h_ or takes arushi _h_ as mares, cf. V, 56, 6.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 73](sbe46023.htm)\n\n"
