Bhaga, Aryaman. 3  \nFortnights and seasons, nights and days,  \nYears, months, and hours, protect thy ways,  \nVrihaspati shall still be nigh,  \nThe War-God, and the Moon on high,  \nAnd N?ad 4 and the sainted seven 5  \nShall watch thee from their starry heaven.  \nThe mountains, and the seas which ring  \nThe world, and Varuna the King,  \nSky, ether, and the wind, whate'er  \nMoves not or moves, for thee shall care.  \nEach lunar mansion be benign,  \nWith happier light the planets shine;  \nAll gods, each light in heaven that glows,  \nPotect my child where'er he goes.  \nThe twilight hours, the day and night,  \nKeep in the wood thy steps aright.  \nWatch, minute, instant, as they flee,  \nShall all bring happiness to thee.  \n\nCelestials and the Titan brood  \nProtect thee in thy solitude,  \nAnd haunt the mighty wood to bless  \nThe wanderer in his hermit dress.  \nFear not, by mightier guardians screened,  \nThe giant or night-roving fiend;  \nNor let the cruel race who tear  \nMan's flesh for food thy bosom scare.  \nFar be the ape, the scorpion's sting,  \nFly, gnat, and worm, and creeping thing.  \nThee shall the hungry lion spare,  \nThe tiger, elephant, and bear:  \nSafe, from their furious might repose,  \nSafe from the horned buffaloes.  \nEach savage thing the forests breed,  \nThat love on human flesh to feed,  \nShall for my child its rage abate,  \nWhen thus its wrath I deprecate.  \nBlest be thy ways: may sweet success  \nThe valour of my darling bless.  \nTo all that Fortune can bestow,  \nGo forth, my child, my Rama, go.  \nGo forth, O happy in the love  \nOf all the Gods below, above;  \nAnd in those guardian powers confide  \nThv paths who keep, thy steps who guide.  \nMay S'ukra, 1b Yama, Sun, and Moon,  \nAnd He who gives each golden boon, 2b  \nWon by mine earnest pravers, be good  \nTo thee, my son, in Dandak wood.  \nFire, wind, and smoke, each text and spell  \nFrom mouths of holy seers that fell,  \nGuard Rama when his limbs he dips,  \nOr with the stream makes pure his lips!  \nMay the great saints and He, the Lord  \nWho made the worlds, by worlds adored,  \nAnd every God in heaven beside  \nMy banished Rama keep and guide.  \n\nThus with due praise the long-eyed dame,  \nEnnobled by her spotless fame,  \nWith wreaths of flowers and precious scent  \nWorshipped the Gods, most reverent.  \nA high-souled Br?man lit the fire,  \nAnd offered, at the queen's desire,  \nThe holy oil ordained to burn  \nFor Rama's weal and safe return.  \nKaus'aly? best of dames, with care  \nSet oil, wreaths, fuel, mustard, there.  \nThen when the rites of fire had ceased,  \nFor Rama's bliss and health, the priest,  \nStanding without gave what remained  \nIn general offering, 3b as ordained.  \n\np. 125  \n\nDealing among the twice-horn train  \nHoney, and curds, and oil, and grain,  \nHe bade each heart and voice unite  \nTo bless. the youthful anchorite.  \nThen Rama's mother, glorious dame  \nBestowed, to meet the Brahman's claim,  \nA lordly fee for duty done:  \nAnd thus again addressed her son:  \n\n'Such blessings as the Gods o'erjoyed  \nPoured forth, when Vritra  1 was destroyed,  \nOn Indra of the thousand eyes,  \nAttend, my child, thine enterprise!  \nYea, such as Vinata once gave  \nTo King Suparna  2 swift and brave,  \nWho sought the drink that cheers the skies,  \nAttend, my child, thine enterprise!  \nYea, such as, when the Amrit rose,  3  \nAnd Indra slew his Daitya foes,  \nThe royal Aditi bestowed  \nOn Him whose hand with slaughter glowed  \nOf that dire brood of monstrous size,  \nAttend, my child, thine enterprise!  \nE'en such as peerless Vishnu graced,  \nWhen with his triple step he paced,  \nOutbursting from the dwarf's disguise,  4  \nAttend, my child, thine enterprise!  \nFloods, isles, and seasons as they fly,  \nWorlds, Vedas, quarters of the sky,  \nCombine, O mighty-armed, to bless  \nThee destined heir of happiness!'  \n\nThe long-eyed lady ceased: she shed  \nPure scent and grain upon his head.  \nAnd that prized herb whose sovereign power  \nPreserves from dark misfortune's hour,  \nUpon the hero's arm she set,  \nTo be his faithful amulet.  \nWhile holy tunes she murmured low,  \nAud spoke glad words though crushed by woe,  \nConcealing with obedient tongue  \nThe pangs with which her heart was wrung.  \nShe bent,she kissed his brow, she pressed  \nHer darling to her troubled breast:  \n'Firm in thy purpose, go,' she cried,  \n'Go Rama, and my bliss betide.  \nAttain returning safe and well,  \nTriumphant in Ayodhya, dwell.  \nThen shall my happy eyes behold  \nThe empire by thy will controlled.  \nThen grief and care shall leave no trace,  \nJoy shall light up thy mother's face,  \nAnd I shall see my darling reign,  \nIn moonlike glory come again.  \nThese eyes shall fondly gaze on thee  \nSo faithful to thy sire's decree,  \n\nWhen thou the forest wild shalt quit  \nOn thine ancestral throne to sit.  \nYea, thou shalt turn from exile back,  \nNor choicest blessings ever lack,  \nThen fill with rapture ever new  \nMy bosom and thy consort's too.  \n   To S'iva and the heavenly host  \n     My worship has been paid,  \n   To mighty saint, to godlike ghost,  \n     To every wandering shade.  \n   Forth to the forest thou wilt hie,  \n     Therein to dwell so long:  \n   Let all the quarters of the sky  \n     Protect my child from wrong.'  \n   Her blessings thus the queen bestowed;  \n     Then round him fondly paced,  \n   And often, while her eyes o'erflowed,  \n     Her dearest son embraced.  \n   Kaus'alya's honoured feet he pressed,  \n     As round her steps she bent,  \n   And radiant with her prayers that blessed,  \n     To Sita's home he went.  \n\n       * * * * *  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[124:1](ry103.htm#fr_292) See p. 41.\n\n[124:2](ry103.htm#fr_293) The first progeny of Brahm?
