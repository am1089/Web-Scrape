 \nFrom every tongue thy glory rings,  \nA scion of a line of kings,  \nTrue to thy vows, of noblest race,  \nWith every gentle gift and grace:  \nWhose tender heart for woe can feel,  \nAnd joy in every creature\'s weal:  \nWhose breast with high ambition swell--  \nKnows duty\'s claim and ne\'er rebels.  \nThey praise thy valour, patience, ruth,  \nThy firmness, self-restrain, and truth  \nThy hand prepared for sin\'s control.  \nAll virtues of a princely soul.  \nI thought of all these gifts of thine,  \nAnd glories of an ancient line,  \nI set my Tara\'s tears at naught,  \nI met Sugriva and we fought.  \nO Rama, till this fatal morn  \nI held that thou wouldst surely scorn  \nTo strike me as I fought my foe  \nAnd thought not of a stranger\'s blow,  \nBut now thine evil heart is shown,  \nA yawning well with grass o\'ergrown.  \nThou wearest virtue\'s badge, 1b but guile  \nAnd meanest sin thy soul defile.  \nI took thee not for treacherous fire,  \nA sinner clad in saint\'s attire;  \nNor deemed thou idly wouldst profess  \nThe show and garb of righteousness.  \nIn fenced town, in open land,  \nNe\'er hast thou suffered at this hand,  \nNor canst of proud contempt complain:  \nThen wherefore is the guiltless slain!  \nMy harmless life in woods I lead,  \nOn forest fruits and roots I feed.  \nMy foeman in the field I sought,  \nAnd ne\'er with thee, O Rama, fought.  \nUpon thy limbs, O King, I see  \nThe raiment of a devotee;  \nAnd how can one like thee, who springs  \nFrom a proud line of ancient kings.  \nBeneath fair virtue\'s mask, disgrace  \nHis lineage by a deed so base?  \nFrom Raghu is thy long descent,  \nFor duteous deeds preeminent:  \nWhy, sinner clad in saintly dress,  \nRoamest thou through the wilderness?  \nTruth, valour, justice free from spot,  \nThe hand that gives and grudges not,  \nThe might that strikes the sinner down,  \nThese bring a prince his best renown.  \nHere in the woods, O King, we live  \nOn roots and fruit which branches give. 2b  \n\np. 345  \n\nThus nature framed our harmless race:  \nThou art a man supreme in place.  \nSilver and gold and land provoke  \nThe fierce attack, the robber\'s stroke.  \nCanst thou desire this wild retreat,  \nThe berries and the fruit we eat?  \n\'Tis not for mighty kings to tread  \nThe flowery path, by pleasure led.  \nTheirs be the arm that crushes sin,  \nTheirs the soft grace to woo and win:  \nThe steadfast will that guides the state,  \nWise favour to the good and great;  \nAnd for all time are kings renowned  \nWho blend these arts and ne\'er confound,  \nBut thou art weak and swift to ire,  \nUnstable, slave of each desire.  \nThou tramplest duty in the dust,  \nAnd in thy bow is all thy trust.  \nThou carest naught for noble gain,  \nAnd treatest virtue with disdain,  \nWhile every sense its captive draws  \nTo follow pleasure\'s changing laws,  \nI wronged thee not in word or deed,  \nBut by thy deadly dart I bleed.  \nWhat wilt thou, mid the virtuous, say  \nTo purge thy lasting stain away?  \nAll these, O King, must sink to hell,  \nThe regicide, the infidel,  \nHe who in blood and slaughter joys,  \nA Brahman or a cow destroys,  \nUntimely weds in law\'s despite  \nScorning an elder brother\'s right, 1  \nWho dares his Teacher\'s bed ascend,  \nThe miser, spy, and treacherous friend.  \nThese impious wretches, one and all,  \nMust to the hell of sinners fall  \nMy skin the holy may not wear,  \nUseless to thee my bones and hair;  \nNor may my slaughtered body be  \nThe food of devotees like thee.  \nThese five-toed things a man may slay  \nAnd feed upon the fallen prey;  \nThe mailed rhinoceros may die,  \nAnd, with the hare his food supply.  \nIguanas he may kill and eat,  \n\nWith porcupine and tortoise meat. 1b  \nBut all the wise account it sin  \nTo touch my bones and hair and skin.  \nMy flesh they may not eat; and I  \nA useless prey, O Rama, die.  \nIn vain my Tara reasoned well,  \nOn dull deaf ears her counsel fell.  \nI scorned her words though sooth and sweet,  \nAnd hither rushed my fate to meet,  \nAh for the land thou rulest! she  \nFinds no protection, lord, from thee,  \nNeglected like some noble dame  \nBy a vile husband dead to shame.  \nMean-hearted coward, false and vile.  \nWhose cruel soul delights in guile,  \nCould Das\'aratha, noblest king,  \nBeget so mean and base a thing?  \nAlas! an elephant, in form  \nOf Rama, in a maddening storm  \nOf passion casting to the ground  \nThe girth of law 2b that clipped him round,  \nToo wildly passionate to feel  \nThe prick of duty\'s guiding steel, 3b  \nHas charged me unawares, and dead  \nI fall beneath his murderous tread  \nHow, stained with this my base defeat.  \nHow wilt thou dare, where good men meet,  \nTo speak, when every tongue will blame  \nWith keen reproach this deed of shame?  \nSuch hero strength and valour, shown  \nUpon the innocent alone,  \nThou hast not proved in manly strife  \nOn him who robbed thee of thy wife.  \nHadst thou but fought in open field  \nAnd met me boldly unconcealed,  \nThis day had been thy fate to fall,  \nSlain by this hand, to Yama\'s hall.  \nIn vain I strove, and struck by thee  \nFell by a hand I could not see.  \nThus bites a snake, for sins of yore,  \nA sleeping man who wakes no more.  \nSugriva\'s foeman thou hast killed,  \nAnd thus his heart\'s desire fulfilled  \nBut, Rama, hadst thou sought me first,  \nAnd told the hope thy soul has nursed,  \nThat very day had I restored  \nTbe Maithil lady to her lord;  \nAnd, binding Ravan with a chain,  \nHad laid him at thy feet unslain.  \n\np. 346  \n\nYea, were she sunk in deepest hell,  \nOr whelmed beneath the ocean\'s swell,  \nI would have followed on her track  \nAnd brought the rescued lady back,  \nAs Hayagriva [1](ry292.htm#fn_595) once set free  \nFrom hell the white As\'vatari. [2](ry292.htm#fn_596)  \nThat when my spirit wings its flight  \nSugriva reign, is just and right.  \nBut most unjust, O King, that I,  \nSlain by thy treacherous hand, should lie,  \nBe still, my heart: this earthly state  \nIs darkly ruled by sovereign Fate.  \nThe realm is lost and won: defy  \nThy questioners with apt reply.\' [3](ry292.htm#fn_597)  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[343:1](ry290.htm#fr_583) Suparna, the Well-winged, is another name of Garuda\nthe King of Birds.
