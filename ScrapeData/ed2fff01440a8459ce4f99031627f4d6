Six persons are (particularly) worthy to receive the honey-mixture\n(madhuparka), 1\n\n2\\. (Viz.) an officiating priest, the bridegroom of one\'s daughter, a king, a\npaternal uncle, a Snataka, a maternal uncle, as well as (others enumerated\nelsewhere).\n\n3\\. (A householder) shall offer, both at the morning and the evening (meals, a\nportion) of the prepared (food) to the Vi _s_ ve Devas in the (sacred)\ndomestic fire. 3\n\np. 50\n\n4\\. Let him give a Bali-offering to the (guardian) deities of the house, 4\n\n5\\. (Thereafter) let him give a portion, one Pala in weight, to a _S_ rotriya\nor to a student, (and afterwards an offering) to the manes. 5\n\n6\\. Next let him feed his guests in due order, the worthiest first, 6\n\n7\\. (Thereafter) the maidens, the infants, the aged, the half-grown members of\nhis family, and pradatas, 7\n\n8\\. Then the other members of his family. 8\n\n9\\. (Outside the house) he shall throw (some food) on the ground for the dogs,\nKa _n_ _d_ alas, outcasts, and crows. 9\n\n10\\. He may give to a _S_ udra either the fragments (of the meal) or (a\nportion of) fresh (food). 10\n\n11\\. The master of the house and his wife may eat what remains. 11\n\np. 51\n\n12\\. A fresh meal for which all (the same materials as for the first) are used\n(may be prepared), if a guest comes after the Vai _s_ vadeva has been offered.\nFor such a (guest) he shall cause to be prepared food (of a) particularly\n(good quality). 12\n\n13\\. For it has been declared in the Veda, \'A Brahma _n_ a guest enters the\nhouse resembling the Vai _s_ vanara fire. Through., him they obtain rain, and\nfood through rain. Therefore people know that the (hospitable reception of a\nguest) is a ceremony averting evil.\'\n\n14\\. Having fed the (guest), he shall honour him. 14\n\n15\\. He shall accompany him to the boundary (of the village) or until he\nreceives permission (to return).\n\n16\\. Let him present (funeral offerings) to the manes during the dark half of\nthe month (on any day) after the fourth. 16\n\n17\\. After issuing an invitation on the day preceding (the _S_ raddha, he\nshall feed on that occasion) three ascetics or three virtuous householders,\nwho are _S_ rotriyas, who are not very aged, who do not follow forbidden\noccupations, and neither (have been his) pupils, nor are (living as) pupils in\nhis house. 17\n\n18\\. He may also feed pupils who are endowed with good qualities. 18\n\n19\\. Let him avoid men neglecting their duties, 19\n\np. 52\n\nthose afflicted with white leprosy, eunuchs, blind men, those who have black\nteeth, those who suffer from black leprosy, (and) those who have deformed\nnails.\n\n20\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): \'Now, if a (Brahma _n_ a)\nversed in the Vedas is afflicted with bodily (defects) which exclude him from\nthe company, Yama declares him to be irreproachable. Such (a man) sanctifies\nthe company.\' 20\n\n21\\. \'At a funeral sacrifice the fragments (of the meal) must not be swept\naway until the end of the day. For streams of nectar flow (from them, and the\nmanes of) those who have received no libations of water drink (them).\' 21\n\n22\\. \'But let him not sweep up the fragments (of the meal) before the sun has\nset. Thence issue rich streams of milk for those who obtain a share with\ndifficulty.\' 22\n\n23\\. \'Manu declares that both the remainder (in the vessels) and the fragments\n(of the meal) certainly are the portion of those members of the family who\ndied before receiving the sacraments.\' 23\n\n24\\. \'Let him give the fragments that have fallen on the ground and the\nportion scattered (on the blades of Ku _s_ a grass), which consists of the\nwipings\n\np. 53\n\nand water, as their food, to the manes of those who died without offspring and\nof those who died young.\'\n\n25\\. \'The malevolent Asuras seek an opportunity (to snatch away) that food\nintended for the manes, which is not supported with both hands;\' 25\n\n26\\. \'Therefore let him not offer it (to the Brahma _n_ as) without holding (a\nspoon) in his hand; or let him stand, holding the dish (with both hands,\nuntil) leavings of both kinds (have been produced).\' 26\n\n27\\. \'He shall feed two (Brahma _n_ as) at the offering to the gods, and three\nat the offering to the manes, or a single man on either occasion; even a very\nwealthy man shall not be anxious (to entertain) a large company.\' 27\n\n28\\. \'A large company destroys these five (advantages), the respectful\ntreatment (of the invited guests, the propriety of) time and place, purity and\n(the selection of) virtuous Brahma _n_ a (guests); therefore he shall not\n(invite a large number).\' 28\n\n29\\. \'Or he may entertain (at a _S_ raddha) even a single Brahma _n_ a who has\nstudied the whole Veda, who is distinguished by learning and virtue, and is\nfree from all evil marks (on his body).\' 29\n\np. 54\n\n30\\. \'(But) how can the oblation to the gods be made if he feeds a single\nBrahma _n_ a at a funeral sacrifice? Let him take (a portion) of each (kind\nof) food that has been prepared (and put it) into a vessel;\'\n\n31\\. \'Let him place it in the sanctuary of a god and afterwards continue (the\nperformance of) the funeral sacrifice. Let him offer that food in the fire or\ngive it (as alms) to a student.\'\n\n32\\. \'As long as the food continues warm, as long as they eat in silence, as\nlong as the qualities of the food are not declared (by them), so long the\nmanes feast on it.\' 32\n\n33\\. \'The qualities of the food must not be declared as long as the (Brahma\n_n_ as who represent the) manes are not satiated. Afterwards when they are\nsatisfied, they may say, "Beautiful is the sacrificial food."\'\n\n34\\. \'But an ascetic who, invited to dine at a sacrifice of the manes or of\nthe gods, rejects meat, shall go to hell for as many years as the slaughtered\nbeast has hairs.\' 34\n\n35\\. \'Three (things are held to) sanctify a funeral sacrifice, a daughter\'s\nson, the midday, and sesamum grains; and they recommend three (other things)\nfor it, purity, freedom from anger and from precipitation.\' 35\n\n36\\. \'The eighth division of the day, during which the sun\'s (progress in the\nheavens) becomes slow, one must know to be midday; what is (then) given to the\nmanes lasts (them) for a very long time.\'\n\n37\\. \'The ancestors of that man who has intercourse 37\n\np. 55\n\nwith a woman after offering or having dined at a _S_ raddha, feed during a\nmonth from that (day) on his semen.\'\n\n38\\. \'A child that is born from (intercourse immediately) after offering a _S_\nraddha or partaking of a funeral repast, is unable to acquire sacred learning\nand becomes short-lived.\'\n\n39\\. \'The father and the grandfather, likewise the great-grandfather, beset a\ndescendant who is born to them, just as birds (fly to) a rig tree;\' 39\n\n40\\. \'(Saying), "He will offer to us funeral repasts with honey and meat, with\nvegetables, with milk and with messes made of milk, both in the rainy season\nand under the constellation Magha _h_."\n\n41\\. \'The ancestors always rejoice at a descendant who lengthens the line, who\nis zealous in performing funeral sacrifices, and who is rich in (images of\nthe) gods and (virtuous) Brahma _n_ a (guests).\' 41\n\n42\\. \'The manes consider him to be their (true) descendant who offers (to\nthem) food at Gaya, and (by the virtue of that gift) they grant him\n(blessings), just as husbandmen (produce grain) on well-ploughed (fields).\' 42\n\n43\\. He shall offer (a _S_ raddha) both on the full moon days of the months\n_S_ rava _n_ a and \xc3\x82grahaya _n_ a and on the Anvash _t_ aki. 43\n\np. 56\n\n44\\. There is no restriction as to time, if (particularly suitable) materials\nand (particularly holy) Brahma _n_ as are at hand, or (if the sacrificer is)\nnear (a particularly sacred) place. 44\n\n45\\. A Brahma _n_ a must necessarily kindle the three sacred fires. 45\n\n46\\. He shall offer (in them) the full and new moon sacrifices, the (half-\nyearly) \xc3\x82graya.a Ish _t_ i, the _K_ aturmasya-sacrifice, the (half-yearly)\nsacrifices at which animals are slain, and the (annual) Soma-sacrifices. 46\n\n47\\. For all this is (particularly) enjoined (in the Veda), and called by way\nof laudation \'a debt.\' 47\n\n48\\. For it is declared in the Veda, \'A Brahma _n_ a is born, loaded with\nthree debts,\' (and further, \'He owes) sacrifices to the gods, a son to the\nmanes, the study of the Veda to the _Ri_ shis; therefore he is free from debt\nwho has offered sacrifices, who has begotten a son, and who has lived as a\nstudent (with a teacher).\' 48\n\n49\\. Let him (ordinarily) initiate a Brahma _n_ a in the eighth (year) after\nconception, 49\n\n50\\. A Kshatriya in the eleventh year after conception,\n\n51\\. A Vai _s_ ya in the twelfth year after conception.\n\n52\\. The staff of a Brahma _n_ a (student may) optionally (be made) of Pala\n_s_ a wood, 52\n\np. 57\n\n53\\. (That) of a Kshatriya optionally of the wood of the Banyan tree,\n\n54\\. (That) of a Vai _s_ ya optionally of Udumbara wood.\n\n55\\. (The staff) of a Brahma _n_ a shall (be of such a length as to) reach the\nhair, 55\n\n56\\. (That) of a Kshatriya the forehead,\n\n57\\. (That) of a Vai _s_ ya the (tip of the) nose.\n\n58\\. The girdle of a Brahma _n_ a shall be made of Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass, 58\n\n59\\. A bowstring (shall be that) of a Kshatriya,\n\n60\\. (That) of a Vai _s_ ya shall be made of hempen threads.\n\n61\\. The upper garment of a Brahma _n_ a (shall be) the skin of a black\nantelope, 61\n\n62\\. (That) of a Kshatriya the skin of a spotted deer,\n\n63\\. (That) of a Vai _s_ ya a cow-skin or the hide of a he-goat.\n\n64\\. The (lower) garment of a Brahma _n_ a (shall be) white (and) unblemished,\n64\n\n65\\. (That) of a Kshatriya dyed with madder,\n\n66\\. (That) of a Vai _s_ ya dyed with turmeric, or made of (raw) silk;\n\n67\\. Or (a dress made of) undyed (cotton) cloth may be worn by (students of)\nall (castes).\n\n68\\. A Brahma _n_ a shall ask for alms placing (the word) \'Lady\' first, 68\n\np. 58\n\n69\\. A Kshatriya placing (the word)\' Lady\' in the middle,\n\n70\\. A Vai _s_ ya placing (the word) Lady\' at the end (of the formula).\n\n71\\. The time (for the initiation) of a Brahma _n_ a has not passed until the\ncompletion of the sixteenth year, 71\n\n72\\. (For that) of a Kshatriya until the completion of the twenty-second,\n\n73\\. (For that) of a Vai _s_ ya until the completion of the twenty-fourth.\n\n74\\. After that they become \'men whose Savitri has been neglected.\' 74\n\n75\\. Let him not initiate such men, nor teach them, nor sacrifice for them;\nlet them not form matrimonial alliances (with such outcasts). 75\n\n76\\. A man whose Savitri has not been performed, may undergo the Uddalaka-\npenance.\n\n77\\. Let him subsist during two months on barley-gruel, during one month on\nmilk, during half a month on curds of two-milk whey, during eight days on\nclarified butter, during six days on alms given without asking, (and) during\nthree days on water, and let him fast for one day and one night.\n\n78\\. (Or) he may go to bathe (with the priests) at the end of an A _s_ vamedha\n(horse-sacrifice). 78\n\n79\\. Or he may offer a Vratya-stoma. 79\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[49:1](sbe1414.htm#fr_285)-2. **XI**. Gautama V, 27-30.

K _ri_ sh _n_\napa _n_ _d_ ita does not take \'agrabhaga\' as a technical term, but explains it\nby \'a first portion, sufficient for a dinner, or as much as one is able to\nspare.\'\n\n[50:6](sbe1414.htm#fr_289) Vish _n_ u LXVII, 28, 36-38.\n\n[50:7](sbe1414.htm#fr_290) Vish _n_ u LXVII, 39. The majority of the MSS. read\nbalav _ri_ ddhataru _n_ apradatas [tato]. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\ncorrects the last word to pradata, while the editor of the Calcutta edition\nwrites prabhriti _m_ s [tato]. Both conjectures are inadmissible. As the same\nphrase occurs once more, below, XIX., 23 (where K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\nwrites pradatara _h_ ), I think that it is not permissible to change the text.\nPradata _h_ must be the correct reading, and a technical name for a class of\nfemale relatives. Etymologically it may mean \'those who have been perfectly\ncleansed.\' But I am unable to trace its precise technical import, and have\nleft it untranslated.\n\n[50:8](sbe1414.htm#fr_291) Vish _n_ u LXVII, 41.\n\n[50:9](sbe1414.htm#fr_292) Vish _n_ u LXVII, 26.\n\n[50:10](sbe1414.htm#fr_293) Gautama V, 25, and note. \'A _S_ udra, i.e. one who\nis his servant.\'--K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita.

The explanation of the word\nnagna, p. 52 \'neglecting their duties,\' is doubtful. I have followed K _ri_ sh\n_n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita, who quotes the Marka _n_ _d_ eya Pura _n_ a in support of\nhis view. The word occurs in the same connexion, Vish _n_ u LXXXII, 27, where\nit is rendered by \'naked.\' Possibly it may refer to ascetics who go entirely\nnaked.\n\n[52:20](sbe1414.htm#fr_301) The Sutra gives an exception to the preceding\nrule.\n\n[52:21](sbe1414.htm#fr_302) I read \' _s_ _k_ yotante hi\' instead of \' _s_ _k_\nyotante val.\'\n\n[52:22](sbe1414.htm#fr_303) \'Those who receive a share with difficulty,\' i.e.\nthe manes of uninitiated children, mentioned in the next verses.\n\n[52:23](sbe1414.htm#fr_304)-24. Vish _n_ u LXXXII, 22 Manu III, 245-246. These\nrules, however, do not fully agree with the teaching of our Manu-sm _ri_ ti,\nas the latter assigns the fragments on the ground to honest and upright\nservants. Sutra 24 I read with the majority of the MSS. \'lepanodakam\' for\n\'lepamodakam,\' and \'anna _m_ preteshu\' for \'anupreteshu.\'\n\n[53:25](sbe1414.htm#fr_305) Manu III, 225.\n\n[53:26](sbe1414.htm#fr_306) Manu III, 224. The meaning of the last clause\nseems to be that the sacrificer shall stand before the Brahma _n_ as until\nthey have done eating.\n\n[53:27](sbe1414.htm#fr_307) Identical with Manu III, 125; see also Vish _n_ u\nLXXIII, 3. The offering to the gods is the Vai _s_ vadeva offering which\nprecedes the _S_ raddha.\n\n[53:28](sbe1414.htm#fr_308) Identical with Manu III, 126.\n\n[53:29](sbe1414.htm#fr_309) Manu III, 129.\n\n[54:32](sbe1414.htm#fr_310) Identical with Vish _n_ u LXXXII, 20, and Manu\nIII, 237.\n\n[54:34](sbe1414.htm#fr_311) Manu V, 35.\n\n[54:35](sbe1414.htm#fr_312) Identical with Manu III, 235.\n\n[54:37](sbe1414.htm#fr_313) Vish _n_ u LXIX, 2-4.\n\n[55:39](sbe1414.htm#fr_314)-40.
