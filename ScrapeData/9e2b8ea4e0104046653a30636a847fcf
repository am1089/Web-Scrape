In ancient\nGreece, in Palestine, and in India up to the era of water-taps and street\nhydrants, that is to say till the other day, the women had an established\nsocial centre, the well from which the community drew its supply of drinking\nwater., Hither, in the last hours before sundown, came the maidens of various\nhouseholds, young daughters-in-law, maybe, in charge of some elderly aunt or\nmother-in-law, or with each other\'s company for chaperonage, each bearing her\nshining metal vessels to be filled. And thence, their mutual talk and task\nbeing ended, went the girls to their homes, with towering loads some two or\nthree pots high, and superb swaying walk. Sometimes, it is said, for a trial\nof skill, they would run and skip, and even dance, as they went along the\nroad, and never a drop of water spilled the while. The hour was held in great\nesteem. The way was avoided by men, and the women proved, what all women know,\nthat their real motive in dressing well is to compete with each other, not to\nshine in the eyes of the sterner sex. Showy silver anklets, the pearl-\ndecorated pad or ring on which the water-pots rested on the head, saris draped\nas severely as in\n\np. 78\n\n[paragraph continues] Greek statues--all these beauties wire arranged for the\ndiscriminating envy or sympathy of sister eyes, not for the enjoyment of a\nbeing who may be trusted to think his own wife and sisters beautiful, yet\ncannot do them the honour to remember what jewels and clothes they wear.\n\nFor a vanity not less than that which chooses a gown in Paris, can go to so\nsimple a matter as the fitting of a dark-blue sari against a fair complexion,\nthat the wearer may look "like the full moon in the midnight sky," the placing\nof opal or diamond on one nostril or the other, or the selecting of a glass\nbangle of white or green, according to the tint of the brown skin. The vanity\nmay be no less, and the highest skill always desires the eye of the keenest\nconnoisseur.\n\nThis picture of the women drawing water has its pendant in the cluster of men\nwho gather for friendly smoke or chat at evening about the smouldering log,\nlighted on the outskirts of the village by any wandering sannyasin who may\nhave taken up his abode for a few days beneath the local banyan tree. But this\nsuggests a wider, more cosmopolitan relation. The men\'s talk is apt to be of\nother lands than their own, and the strange customs and lapses of customs\nprevailing there. Their interests are rather general, abstract, impersonal.\nFor the yellow-robed guest of the village is, it must be remembered, a\ntraveller of the ancient time. He has not journeyed in railway trains and\nlived in hotels. Rather, tramping his way from village to village, he has\nshared, at each halting-place, in its personal drama; has begged a meal daily\nfrom door to door; has eaten, therefore, the characteristic food, cooked and\nserved according to the ways of each district. By such modes the geographical\nsense of this old-time wayfarer is developed far beyond that of a generation\nthat lives on maps and learns from the schedules\n\np. 79\n\nof facts known as newspaper reports and the journals of other men\'s travels.\nAnd it is his geographical knowledge that he shares with the men of the\n\'tillage where he eats and sleeps for a few days. In the old Sanskrit books,\nkings are represented as receiving such guests with the question, "What have\nyou seen elsewhere?" and asking before they depart, "And what have you noted\nhere?"\n\nBut amongst the women gathered about the well it was the civic life that found\nexpression, the civic life of the village or small township. Here they could\nform a consolidated feminine opinion, of great weight in local affairs, and\nexchange the news of the day with each other. The better organisation of\npublic convenience now deprives them of the laborious necessity of meeting in\nthe old way; but it is much to be desired that, with the dying out of their\nancient forms and institutions, new occasions of assembly and new subjects of\ndiscussion might spontaneously arise. At present Indian emotion spends itself\nmore and more within the home. Woman, always dominant in private life, by her\nvery affection is cooperating with the loss of public institutions to restrict\nthe activity of Man. Surely, then, Europe has no right to grow contemptuous if\nrich men prove effeminate and poor men inefficient, or taunt India with the\nfact that she has not yet seized the ethos of the West, that her princes send\nout no expeditions to discover the South Pole, and her youth grow up with no\nconsuming curiosity about rocks and stars; for the European organisation\nquietly defeats all through which the people are accustomed to find expression\nand yet fails to call them to new responsibilities, in which their mind and\ncharacter could receive adequate scope and stimulus in a different form.\n\nIt is quite evident that if the centre of social\n\np. 80\n\ngravity is some day to be shifted, if the intellectual atmosphere of India is\nyet to be saturated with fresh ideals, not only must her womanhood participate\nin the results of the implied revolution, but they must contribute largely to\nbringing it about. For it is the home, not the factory, that fills life with\ninspiration; and the school, in British India, is no more than a mill or\ninstitution in which children master the reading and writing necessary to\nfuture clerkships, as-they might learn the technical processes of any other\nindustry. A census-taking, index-making age conceives that without literacy\nthere is no education, as if to read the _Strand Magazine_ were greater than\nto be the mother of Shakespeare. With such an age it is difficult to argue\nregarding the existing education of a Hindu woman. Yet if a thorough training\nin a national mode of living, and that extremely complicated, be an education,\nshe has something; for the ordinary wife can act in any capacity, from that of\ncook or dairy-mistress to that of chief of commissariat and general\nadministrator for a hundred or more persons If a knowledge of language,\npoetry, and folk-lore, with all thereby con- noted of logical and imaginative\ndevelopment, form an education, she has this, sometimes to the extent of\nunderstanding and reciting works in Sanskrit. More: poor women who may not be\nable to read and write are deeply, and even passionately, possessed of the\nspirit of the ancient culture. The philosophy of Maya, not seldom bewildering\nto the Western _savant_ , has no difficulty for them. They understand to a\nhair the meaning of the word _Nirvana_. It is no one special command to deny\noneself and take up a cross and follow, that has weight with them; but the\nbearing of the great law of renunciation on the personal realisation of\nfreedom. Add to all this the inbred habit of life in community, and it will\nappear that under the old\n\np. 81\n\nscheme women found not only a training and a discipline, but also a career.\n\nIt was a preparation and an opportunity fitted only, it is true, to the soil\non which it grew. This limitation pervades the whole of the Indian\ncivilisation. The Indian mind is more contented with the architectural and\nnatural beauties of the home, more free from a desire for extraneous\ndecorative detail, than any other taste in the world, perhaps, and in the same\nway it has devised a daily round of duty which belongs strictly to its place.\nThe good mother-in-law occupies the position of the lady of the manor in\nEnglish feudal days. But whereas the manorial household could be transplanted\nto any age or clime almost intact--Japan, Rajputana, Turkey, Scandinavia, and\nSpain furnishing parallels fairly complete--the same is not true of the Indian\ntype. Here the girls gathered round its head are the wives of her sons,\ninstead of her husband\'s vassals. And it is the care of babies, the treatment\nof animals, and all kinds of cooking and domestic offices, rather than deft\nspinning and dainty embroidery, with which they are busied under her. Caste\nequalises the dignity of beggar and king, and the form of work is merely a\nquestion of wealth.\n\nAt the same time, while every detail of the Indian domestic system is\njustified arid justifiable, we cannot refuse to admit that some great\neducational readjustment is necessary at this moment, if only because long\nhabit blinds the eye to the forest that looks much upon the trees; but when\nthe trees grow too scanty it is the forest, as a whole, that demands our care.\nTo-day every Indian woman can cook, and that well. But she cannot sew, and she\nhas nothing but gossip and prayer when the afternoon siesta is over wherewith\nto occupy her leisure. The great-grandmothers of the present generation were\nas busy in spinning as our own ancestresses, and one\n\np. 82\n\nof the chief domestic joys was to take the yarn to the weaver with the measure\nof grain for which he would make it into a web. To-day, alas, the weaver finds\nit difficult enough to maintain himself by the fine work, for which there is\nalways some market, shrunken though it be, and the common sari of the women\'s\ndaily wear is spun and woven by machinery, far away in Manchester or Glasgow.\nHere also, then, the modern revolution has narrowed her lot. A like\ndestruction is being felt in all directions. Higher standards of comfort are\nrapidly arising. The days when the little boys in the village school wrote on\nthe floor in sand are long past. Even the palm-leaf manuscript is little more\nthan a memory. Steel pen, instead of wooden stylus, cheap paper, smooth\nwriting fluids are everywhere. Soap * is becoming a necessity. European\nutensils for cleaning, for cooking, and even for eating, are coming into use.\nCertain kinds of furniture are growing familiar. Kerosene and tin and modern\nglass are to be found in every village. But this does not mean that the people\nare learning to provide these things for themselves, much less does it imply\nthat they are mastering their use and incorporating their production under the\nold caste-crafts, bringing their Indian taste and intelligence to bear upon\ncreating new modifications of Western forms. What it does mean is that the\ncountry has already become a host to the parasite of European trade.\nAbsolutely and fatally obedient to laws of patent and copyright, the people\naccept any new convenience as it stands, allow the village craftsman to go by\nthe door, cease\n\np. 83\n\nto use the old-fashioned utensil, whatever it may have been, and allow the\nstereotyped ugliness of the new acquisition to corrupt taste and standards as\nlong as it lasts. Even the brass-smiths have quietly accepted the fact that\ntheir metal is cheapest brought in sheets from Europe, and housewives mourn in\nvain that their beautiful brass cooking vessels are no longer fit to be\nheirlooms, as were those of their grandmothers. In all this India is not more\ncareless or easy of corruption than European countries themselves. She has\nmore to lose and is more defenceless, that is all, and she has not learnt to\nthink of such questions on the national scale.\n\nOrthodoxy does, of course, oppose some obstacle to this process of decay. It\nwould still be accounted an act of vulgarity if a man of means gave a piece of\nEnglish cotton as wearing apparel to a friend. Soap, kerosene oil, and the\nsubstitution of chairs for mats, are still regarded askance by the leaders of\npious opinion. But this opposition savours too much of mere prejudice.\nTherefore it can only retard, it cannot overcome, the evil. What is wanted in\nthis regard is a dynamic orthodoxy, capable of enforcing a decision that only\nwhat Indian people can make ought Indian persons to use. And such a canon, it\nis needless to point out, would have to find its root and strength in the\nwomen, who are buyers and consumers, reaching the craftsmen through\nconstituted social and religious channels. Once having obtained a grip of the\nnational conscience, no political or commercial cajolery would be of the\nslightest avail against this principle; but then, if the people were capable\nof understanding and carrying out such an idea--women, priests, pundits, heads\nof castes, and labourers--the whole problem would already have been solved,\nand there would be no disaster from which India must be saved.\n\nIt is clear that as the objective of the old education\n\np. 84\n\nof Indian women lay in _character_ , the new cannot aim lower. The distinctive\nelement, therefore, in their future training cannot be reading and writing--\nthough these will undoubtedly grow more common--but the power to grasp clearly\nand with enthusiasm the ideas of nationality, national interests, and the\nresponsibility of the individual to race and country. Even in Europe, habits\nand opinions tend to stereotype and harden themselves quite as much as in the\nOrient. But at present there is still a certain flexibility. This flexibility\nrather than any definite change is what the East requires. It is a form of\nfreedom and mastery. European communities, in consequence of this mobility of\nstructure, enjoy a power of intelligent co-operation towards new but agreed\nends which is universally desirable. India has the power to act, but the end\nmust be familiar. A few women will organise themselves at a moment\'s notice to\ncook for hundreds or even thousands of guests, without the least waste of\nenergy or temper such as Western women would incur in organising a soup-\nkitchen. But if we call the guests "the unemployed," and refer to them as "a\nsocial problem," the Oriental becomes bewildered, as would we in like manner\nwere it proposed to us to regard them all as visitors. It is clear that the\nWestern mode of approaching such tasks can only be acquired by India, if it be\nnecessary, through an enlarged idea of the public Ife.\n\nWhen the women see themselves in their true place, as related to the soil on\nwhich they live, as related to the past out of which they have sprung; when\nthey become aware of the needs of their own people, on the actual colossal\nscale of those needs; when the mother-heart has once awakened in them to beat\nfor land and people, instead of family, village, and homestead alone, and when\nthe mind is set to explore facts in the service of that heart--then and\n\np. 85\n\nthen alone shall the future of Indian womanhood dawn upon the race in its\nactual greatness; then shall a worthy education be realised; and then shall\nthe true national ideal stand revealed.\n\nSuch a change, however, is only possible as a direct growth out of old\nconceptions. The national idea cannot be imposed from without--it must develop\nfrom within. And this will be in full congruity with the national religions.\nIslam, in the days of its power, rejoiced to establish itself as Indian on\nIndian soil. The architectural works of the Mogul emperors are full of\nenthusiasm for the Indian past, for the Indo-Saracenic style owes as much to\nRajputana as to Mecca and Constantinople. Asiatic among Asiatics--there was no\nwide gap between Mussulman conquerors and Hindu conquered: no gap in taste, or\nmorals, or style of thought and education. The newcomer settled down as a\nchild of the land, in his own home. His children were first Indian, and only\nin the second place members of the Mohammedan confraternity. Today, under the\nnecessity of a secular expression, there is nothing whatever to prevent him\nfrom projecting himself upon the cause of his own people, both Hindu and\nMohammedan, and working for them with that same power with which his fathers\nonce made the deserts of Arabia ring. For the Hindu, the point should be still\nmore obvious. His avatars have lived always for humanity. They have appeared\nin the hour of the national need. They have been followed by waves of popular\nand political rejuvenance. Neither Hinduism nor Mohammedanism has been weak in\nputting forward the claims of soil. The sacred texts go so far as to say that\nhe who dies for his country at once attains the Beatific Vision. With regard\nto their fundamental duties, both faiths stand like converging artillery in\nthe world of motive, ready to shoot forth individuals\n\np. 86\n\nupon the great common task of remaking the motherland.\n\nBut for all this again, there must be a re-reading of orthodoxy, a re-\ndiscovery of essentials. Already the revolution has commenced that is to bring\nthis about. Already India has begun to realise that if poverty is to be\ndefeated, if national efficiency is to be achieved, she dare not continue much\nlonger to glorify the element of blind refusal. Vital orthodoxy, however we\ndefine it, certainly cannot be the child of fear alone, always on the\ndefensive, never becoming aggressive, its best courage that of endurance or\nresignation. He whose idea has ceased to advance is already in retreat. There\nwas a time when everything in India was her own. In those days she went\nforward freely, welcoming the new as an advance in power and knowledge, not\nmeeting it with terror as a defilement. Indian orthodoxy, then, must learn\nonce more to struggle forward. But we are met by a host of questions. Amongst\nmany conflicting paths, which is to be chosen? Towards what goal? By what\nmethods? What is to be included? What eliminated? Here are the actual\ndifficulties. Every one is agreed that certain things must be done, but no one\ncan distinctly picture how.\n\nYet the weakness is easy enough to probe. The West conquers the East, as long\nas the East on the one hand shuns it as contamination, or, on the other,\naccepts it as a bribe. The idea of assimilating just so much of Western\nscience as shall enable India to compete in the same market by the same\nprocesses as the West is as delusive as it is mean. The idea of refusing to\nparticipate in Western methods, and dying of starvation if need be, martyrs to\nnational purity, is manifestly impracticable for the people at large, even if\nit had not long ago been carried out of reach of all on the high tides of\neconomic disaster. What then?\n\np. 87\n\n_Western Science must be recognised as holy. The idea of that Science must be\ngrasped and pursued for its own sake_. Modern astronomy must claim its "star-\nintoxicated" prophets in the East as in the West. Geology, physics, biology,\nand the sublime and growing sciences of man, history and morals, must be felt\nin India as new modes of the apprehension of truth, studied passionately\nwithout ulterior object, as the religious experience is now followed, at the\ncost of all.\n\nSuch an attitude is, indeed, of the very essence of the Asiatic genius. To it\nmathematics have never sunk to the position which they tend to occupy in\nEurope--a convenient means for the measurement of secular utilities--but have\nalways been held as a sacred inviolable method of expressing the fundamental\nunity of phenomena. The learned man will mention this subject with the same\nthrob in his voice that we may give to a great picture or a moving poem. The\nIndian imagination regards all knowledge of beatitude. Nor is any intellect in\nthe world more keenly logical and inquisitive, or at the same time more\ndisinterested and comprehensive in its grasp. A great Indian school of science\nis therefore no absurdity, but, under necessary conditions, one of the most\nattainable of all ambitions. The Hindu has but to realise that the world waits\nfor the hundred and eight Upanishads of modern knowledge; the Mussulman needs\nonly to understand that the time is again ripe for Averrhoes and Avicenna; and\nboth will make, not only their own opportunity, but a new era in culture as\nwell.\n\nThis is not merely an inspiration of defence. Oriental methods have had an\nunparalleled success in producing a widely extended amelioration of conduct\nand cultivation of mind. Any large country town in India may be observed, and\nthe number of its saints and scholars counted. Not even the most\n\np. 88\n\nfavoured of London suburbs can boast, of its commercial or scientific order,\nso many men severely learned. But the old Indian learning is now complete. The\ntask is done. There is nothing left for the common mind to add.\n\nIt is necessary, therefore, as a vindication of that great intellectual vigour\nwhich it has actually bred, that new worlds of mental conquest should be\nfound, new subjects opened, and a new development initiated, in which the\ncommon people shall measure their strength against the modern world, and learn\ntheir power.\n\nOut of such a revolution, but as an incident, not as its main goal, must\ninevitably arise a development of mechanical skill which, in the East, might\nsteer clear of the demoralisation produced elsewhere by the worship of\nusefulness and privilege. It is certain that if India throw herself freely\nupon a mechanical era, she will restore to the factory hand those human\nqualities and ethical prerogatives which in the West he tends more and more to\nlose.\n\nIn order to make such changes possible, however, there would need to be a\nspontaneous appearance, in various parts of the country, of persons with the\nsynthetic habit of mind and heart. India is actually a unity, but few of her\npeople realise the fact, and fewer still feel the appropriate emotion. No\nparochial ambition can, at this juncture, save the motherland. The Mahratta\nmay not seek the good of Maharashtra, nor the Sikh of the Punjab. There must\nbe no revival of forgotten feuds. Not in such things lies the thrill of\nnationality. Rather, all must unite in a common glorification of India and the\nwhole Indian past. Each must recognise what the others have contributed. There\nmust be thinkers able to take advantage of every accident in local history,\nand to turn it to the advantage of the one great cause. The passion of\nnationality\n\np. 89\n\nwas so strong in the Punjab, in Rajputana, and under Sivaji, that it broke\neven the power of the Mogul Empire. Yet the fact that she has never had any\ndefinite and consolidated form of her own may be the critical element in the\nhistory of Bengal, to make her the welder and fuser of all the provinces to-\nday.\n\nSuch an inspiration as this is social as well as political. It is religious in\nthe highest sense. It has to fill home, school, and market-place. There is no\nquestion therefore as to its requiring the cooperation of woman with man. For\nher, also, there is a new and greater orthodoxy. She must become of her own\nfreedom that which custom now makes her. Eastern piety is often good\nbacteriology. Sitola, the Smallpox Goddess, is depicted as riding on the\nwasherman\'s donkey, an unclean beast. But requiring to be worshipped with\nwater and broom, and isolation of the patient. The myth is admirable. Europe\ncan show nothing of its kind so good. But the next step is, obviously, facts\nat first hand. Woman must be enabled to know, think, and judge freely, on all\nquestions such as those of food and the public health. The severe exigencies\nof modern labour make the old food and cooking entirely insufficient.\nDyspepsia has become a national curse; yet this is certainly one of the\ndifficulties that could be overcome. An extended choice of food-stuffs, and\nthe alternative of simple methods of preparation, would be fully consonant\nwith orthodoxy, which has always aimed at making the body the servant of man,\nand not his master.\n\nWith increasing poverty, and the tendency to break up the family into smaller\ngroups, the career within the community-house is becoming limited. This will\nhave to be counterbalanced by some increase of the power to consider national\nand communal responsibilities. The Mahabharata, the Ramayana\n\np. 90\n\nand the Puranas, represent the culture of nationality popularised. Every\nritual, every sacrament, is full of unwritten history. But the times demand a\ndirect and simple knowledge of the fact even more than of the vehicle. To meet\nthis demand, however, is not to attack orthodoxy, but to fulfil it, to carry\nit to its highest power.\n\nThere is no question here of educating an intellect hitherto left in barbarous\nignorance. Only those can do vital service to the Indian woman who, in a\nspirit of entire respect for her existing conventions and her past, recognise\nthat they are but offering new modes of expression to qualities already\ndeveloped and expressed in other ways under the old training. Therefore the\nfundamental task of grasping and conveying the inspiration of the West must be\nperformed by Easterns for Easterns, and not by foreigners.\n\nNor ought the result of such a process to be in any sense denationalising. To\nassimilate an ideal and make our own persons a demonstration of its power--\nthis is not imitation. A merely imitative apprehension of the West--like that\nof the clerk in his office, the constitutional agitator in politics, the\nmanufacturer who knows only enough of mechanical industry for a cheek-by-jowl\ncompetition with Manchester--is indeed the parent of death to the Orient. But\nto achieve a living, forceful, heart-to-heart appropriation of the Western\nenergy and its immediate re-translation into Eastern terms, is not death but\nlife.\n\nThe East suffers, as has been said, from the very perfection of its formulae.\n"Tell the truth," says the commandment in the Occident; and again, "Be\ncourteous in thy speech." How often have we not seen crude logic struggle\nblindly to co-ordinate these conflicting dicta, with how many degrees of ill-\nsuccess! But in the East, for more than two\n\np. 91\n\nthousand years, people have lived under the shadow of Manu\'s saying: "Tell the\ntruth, but not that which is unpleasant; tell the pleasant, but not that which\nis untrue." Alas, its completeness leaves nothing to be added! That\nunconquered space winch the mind needs to bring out its fullest potentiality;\nthat strip of wilderness to be empirically observed and reclaimed, and finally\nannexed to the territory of prescribed law; that sense of personal adventure\non the great ocean of truth, there to encounter tempests of doubt and negation\nand overcome by slowly gathered knowledge only,--all these are now most\nattainable in the view of the Universe which is presented by Western science.\n\nVery little that deserves the name of Education has been attempted in modern\nIndia. A machine has been created; an organisation stands ready. But nothing\nin all this represents the work of the people themselves, for ends which they\nspontaneously perceive to be good in themselves. Moreover, liberal ideals of\nwhat Education means are wanting. It is obvious that no system can be complete\ntill secular culture exists in all forms and grades as does religious culture\nnow, from that of the child playing with sense-impressions, up to the solitary\nstudent, standing on mountain-peaks of knowledge where human foot before his\nhas never trodden, and yet finding abundance of sympathy and understanding and\nnew stimulus again, in the social matrix out of which he climbed, when he\nreturns to recount his vision and his wandering.\n\nThe process of creating a great nation out of the rich civilisations and\nfaiths of an Eastern land is by no means simple. Yet there is not a single\nweapon that is not ready to hand. Long ages of peace (for the trifling feuds\nof dynasties do not disturb the fundamental peace of agricultural peoples)\nhave somewhat puerilised the military factors in the faiths.\n\np. 92\n\n[paragraph continues] Yet still the fencing is exhibited at the Mohurrum;\nstill the weapons are carried in procession at the feast of Durga; still the\ngreat Kayasth * families of Bengal and the Kshatriyas of Rajputana practise\nthe annual Worship and Tribute of the Sword. And still the women throng to the\ntemples with lighted candles on the eve of the Birth-feast of the War Lord in\nDecember, to make it the most imposing in the year. A still more extraordinary\nparadox lies in the fact that it is India the peaceful, the patient, the\nentirely submissive, which possesses the most militant and stirring of all the\nworld\'s Evangels--the Gospel of the Blessed One, uttered from a war-chariot on\nthe actual field of battle.\n\nThere is another feature necessary to the making of a great people--a sense of\ncommunity among all classes. Sharp distinction of races and manners has made\nthe pariahs of the South a byword among the nations, and the very name of\nIndia a synonym for caste as opposed to nationality. Yet even in the South,\nand amongst these same pariahs, the effort has been made. The whole life of\nRamanuja, the great religious leader, was as passionate an offering to the\ndespised and rejected as that of the Teacher of Galilee is represented to have\nbeen. Even here, then, the national consolidation sounds no new note in Hindu\nears. Islam is nothing if not a great mission of fraternity. Guru Nanak in the\nNorth, \xe2\x80\xa0 and Ramanuja in the South, \xe2\x80\xa1 have preached the same doctrine in words\nand lives made ever memorable. And if once the mother-heart of India can\n\np. 93\n\ngrasp the meaning and necessity of these incidents in its own history, we\nshall see all barriers broken, all difficulties overcome, and a new age\ninaugurated that shall be at once the flowering-point and blossom of all the\nrealisations of the past.\n\nBut how do we propose that Indian women shall grasp an idea of such vastness\nas this of Nationality? How are they to acquire the knowledge necessary to\ndefine it? And how are they to grow in clear and accurate mastery of essential\nfacts? Is it to be expected that the conventional channels of their education\n--the Homeric singers who chant the epics from door to door--is it to be\nexpected that these shall transform themselves at a stroke from pious\nrhapsodists into heroic bards, chanting of nationality? No, it is clear enough\nthat such a change could only befall them as result, not cause, of some great\nupheaval, from which the nation herself had emerged radiant, victorious,\nimpressing herself upon the imaginations of her own children for ages to come.\nBut the spring of such an upheaval, where is that to be found?\n\nIn answer to such questions we can only assure ourselves that when the world\nis ripe for some epochal idea--as the Indian world is surely ripe today--that\nidea pours itself in from all sides upon the waiting consciousness. The very\nstones speak it, and the timbers out of the wall cry out and answer them; some\nimmense struggle for the common good precipitates itself; idea and struggle\nact and react, each throwing the other into greater distinctness, till the\ngoal of both is finally achieved.\n\nThis is the more true in these days of telegraphy and letter-writing, of a\ncommon language and cheap print. A process which in Asoka\'s India would have\ntaken at least two hundred years, may now be accomplished in a single decade.\nAnd wherever a word of English goes, the national idea constitutes\n\np. 94\n\nfor itself the necessity of an apostolate. No one can say exactly how it will\ncome to birth among the women. Some will catch it for themselves. Some will\ngather it from the men Some are possessed of it already. But it is certain\nthat woman, with her determinately synthetic interests, will refuse long to be\nbaulked of her right to consider things as a whole. The interest of the mother\nis ever with the future. Woman will readily understand that a single\ngeneration of accomplished defeat is sufficient to divorce a whole race from\nits patrimony; and she will determine, and effectively determine, that the lot\nof her own sons shall be victory, and not surrender.\n\nAnd if once the Oriental woman seize the helm of the ship in this fashion,\nsolving the problems of her whole country, whom is it suggested that she shall\nafterwards petition for the redress of her own grievances?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[82:*](wil08.htm#fr_5) Lest it should be thought that India had ever been a\nland of the unclean, let me point out here that the use of earths and oils for\nthe bath has always been compulsory.
