Not Ether; on account of the absence of scriptural statement.\n\nWe have demonstrated that the Sa _n_ khya-system and other systems standing\noutside the Veda are untenable since they rest on fallacious reasoning and are\nself-contradictory. In order to prove that our own view is altogether free\nfrom all objections of this kind, we shall now explain in detail the mode in\nwhich this world, with all its sentient and non-sentient beings, is produced\nby Brahman, whom we hold to be the general creator.\n\nThe first doubt here presenting itself is whether Ether be something produced\nor not.--The Purvapakshin maintains that it is not produced, since there is no\nscriptural statement to that effect. A scriptural statement may be expected\nwith regard to what is possible; but what is impossible--as e.g. the\norigination of a sky-flower or of Ether--cannot possibly be taught by\nScripture. For the origination of Ether, which is not made up of parts and is\nall pervasive, cannot be imagined in any way. For this very reason, i.e. the\nimpossibility of the thing, the _Kh_ andogya, in its account of creation,\nmentions the origination of fire, water, &c. only (but not of Ether)--'It\nthought, may I 'be many, may I grow forth,' 'It sent forth fire,' and so on.\nWhen therefore the Taittiriya, the Atharva _n_ a, and other texts tell us that\nEther did originate--'From that Self sprang Ether' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'From\nhim is born breath, mind, and all organs of sense, Ether, air, light, water,'\n&c. (Mu. Up. II, 1, 4)--such statements are contrary to sense, and hence\nrefute themselves.--To this the Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2. But there is](sbe48248.htm)\n\n"
