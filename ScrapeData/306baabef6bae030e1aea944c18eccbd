Such a (sacrificial stake) as has much substance 1 is not\nauspicious to cattle, whence he who desires to have cattle should not make\nsuch a one his sacrificial stake: but such a one as is of little hardness is\nauspicious to cattle, whence he who desires to have cattle should make such a\none his sacrificial stake.\n\n11:7:3:22\\. And such a one as, while being crooked, has a top like a spit, is\ncalled 'kapoti 2'; and whoever makes such a one his sacrificial stake\ncertainly goes to yonder world before his full measure of life: therefore let\nno one wishing for long life make such a one his sacrificial stake.\n\np. 124\n\n11:7:3:33\\. And such a one as is bent at the top, and bent outwards 1 in the\nmiddle, is a type of hunger (poverty); and if any one makes such a one his\nsacrificial stake, his dependants will certainly be hungry; therefore let no\none wishing for food make such a one his sacrificial stake. But such a one as\nis bent at the top and bent inwards in the middle, is a type of food\n(prosperity): therefore let him who wishes for food make such a one his\nsacrificial stake.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[123:1](sbe44039.htm#fr_384) That is, as would seem, made of very hard wood.\nIt cannot mean 'pithy,' because at [XIII, 4, 4, 9](sbe44105.htm#13:4:4:9), the\nKhadira (acacia catechu), a tree of very hard, solid wood, is mentioned as\n'bahusara.'\n\n[123:2](sbe44039.htm#fr_385) Either 'that which has a pigeon (sitting) on it'\n(kapotin, viz. yupa), or, as Saya _n_ a takes it, fem. of 'kapota,'--a female\npigeon; i.e. a tree too much pointed at the top.\n\n[124:1](sbe44039.htm#fr_386) That is, as would seem, bent to the opposite side\nfrom that towards which the top tends.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 7, 4.
