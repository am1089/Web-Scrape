 \nI from his debt my sire will free,  \nThy well-loved towers again will see,  \n\nAnd, coming from my wild retreat,  \nMy mother and my father meet.\'  \n\np. 152  \n\nThen burning grief inflamed his eye,  \nAs his right arm he raised on high,  \nAnd, while hot tears his check bedewed,  \nAddressed the mournful multitude:  \n\'By love and tender pity moved,  \nYour love for me you well have proved;  \nNow turn again with joy, and win  \nSuccess in all your hands begin\'  \n\nBefore the high souled chief they bent,  \nWith circling steps around him went,  \nAnd then with bitter wailing, they  \nDeparted each his several way.  \nLike the great sun engulfed by night,  \nThe hero sped beyond their sight,  \nWhile still the people mourned his fate  \nAnd wept aloud disconsolate.  \n\nThe car-borne chieftain passed the bound  \nOf Kos\'ala\'s delightful ground.  \nWhere grain and riches bless the land,  \nAnd people give with liberal hand:  \nA lovely realm unvexed by fear,  \nWhere countless shrines and stakes  1 appear:  \nWhere mango-groves and gardens grow,  \nAnd streams of pleasant water flow:  \nWhere dwells content a well-fed race,  \nAnd countless kine the meadows grace:  \nFilled with the voice of praise and prayer:  \nEach hamlet worth a monarch\'s care.  \nBefore him three-pathed Ganga rolled  \nHer heavenly waters bright and cold;  \nO\'er her pure breast no weeds were spread,  \nHer banks were hermit-visited.  \nThe car-borne hero saw the tide  \nThat ran with eddies multiplied,  \nAnd thus the charioteer addressed:  \n\'Here on the bank to-day we rest.  \nNot distant from the river, see!  \nThere grows a lofty Ingudi  \nWith blossoms thick on every spray:  \nThere rest we, charioteer, to-day.  \nI on the queen of floods will gaze,  \nWhose holy stream has highest praise,  \nWhere deer, and bird, and glittering snake,  \nGod, Daitya, bard their pastime take."  \n\nSumantra, Lakshman gave assent,  \nAnd with the steeds they thither went.  \nWhen Rama reached the lovely tree,  \nWith Sita and with Lakshman, he  \nAlighted from the car: with speed  \nSumantra loosed each weary steed,  \nAnd hand to hand in reverence laid,  \nStood near to Rama in the shade.  \nRama\'s dear friend, renowned by fame,  \nWho of Nishada lineage came,  \nGuha, the mighty chief, adored  \nThrough all the land as sovereign lord,  \nSoon as he heard that prince renowned  \n\nWas resting on Nishada ground,  \nBegirt by counsellor and peer  \nAnd many an honoured friend drew near.  \nSoon as the monarch came in view,  \nRama and Lakshman toward him flew.  \nThen Guha, at the sight distressed,  \nHis arms around the hero pressed,  \nLaid both his hands upon his head  \nBowed to those lotus feet, and said:  \n\'O Rama, make thy wishes known,  \nAnd be this kingdom as thine own.  \nWho, mighty-armed, will ever see  \nA guest so dear as thou to me?\'  \n\nHe placed before him dainty fare  \nOf every flavour, rich and rare,  \nBrought forth the gift for honoured guest,  \nAnd thus again the chief addressed  \n\'Welcome, dear Prince, whose arms are strong;  \nThese lands and all to thee belong.  \nThy servants we, our lord art thou;  \nBegin, good king, thine empire now.  \nSee, various food before thee placed,  \nAnd cups to drink and sweets to taste  \nFor thee soft beds are hither borne,  \nAnd for thy horses grass and corn.\'  \n\nTo Guha as he pressed and prayed,  \nThus Raghu\'s son his answer made:  \n\'\'Twas aye thy care my heart to please  \nWith honour, love, and courtesies,  \nAnd friendship brings thee now to greet  \nThy guest thus humbly on thy feet.\'  \n\nAgain the hero spake, as round  \nThe king his shapely arms he wound:  \n\'Guha, I see that all is well  \nWith thee and those who with thee dwell;  \nThat health and bliss and wealth attend  \nThy realm, thyself, and every friend.  \nBut all these friendly gifts of thine,  \nBound to refuse, I must decline.  \nGrass, bark, and hide my only wear,  \nAnd woodland roots and fruit my fare,  \nOn duty all my heart is set;  \nI seek the woods, an anchoret.  \nA little grass and corn to feed  \nThe horses--this is all I need.  \nSo by this favour, King, alone  \nShall honour due to me be shown.  \nFor these good steeds who brought me here  \nAre to my sire supremely dear;  \nAnd kind attention paid to these  \nWill honour me and highly please,\'  \nThen Guha quickly bade his train  \nGive water to the steeds, and grain,  \nAnd Rama, ere the night grew dark,  \nPaid evening rites in dress of bark,  \nAnd tasted water, on the strand,  \nDrawn from the stream by Lakshman\'s hand.  \nAnd Lakshman with observance meet  \nBathed his beloved brother\'s feet,  \n\np. 153  \n\nWho rested with his Maithil spouse:  \nThen sat him down \'neath distant boughs.  \nAnd Guha with his bow sat near  \nTo Lakshman and the charioteer,  \nAnd with the prince conversing kept  \nHis faithful watch while Rama slept.  \nAs Das\'aratha\'s glorious heir,  \nOf lofty soul and wisdom rare,  \nReclining with his Sita there  \n   Beside the river lay--  \nHe who no troubles e\'er had seen,  \nWhose life a life of bliss had been--  \nThat night beneath the branches green  \n   Passed pleasantly away.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[151:1](ry128.htm#fr_321) Known to Europeans as the Goemtee.\n\n[151:2](ry128.htm#fr_322) A tree, commonly called _Ingua_.\n\n[152:1](ry128.htm#fr_323) Sacrificial posts to which the victims were tied.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LI.: Lakshman\'s Lament.](ry129.htm)\n\n'
