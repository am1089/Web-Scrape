Suta said :-- Then the Devas, on arriving at Vaiku _nt_ ha, saw the Lord\nof Lak _s_ mi, the Deva of the Devas, the World-Teacher, with his eyes\nbeautiful like Padma Palasa (lotus-leaves), shining with brilliance and began\nto praise Him in a voice choked with intense feelings of devotion, thus :--\n\xc2\x93Victory to Vi _sn_ u! O Lord of Rama! Thou art prior to the Vira _t_ Puru _s_\na. O Enemy of the Daityas! O Thou, the Generator of desires in all and the\nBestower of the fruits of those desires to all! O Gobinda! Thou art the Great\nBoar and Thou art of the nature of Great Sacrifices! O Maha Vi _sn_ u! O Lord\nof Dharma! Thou art the Cause of the origin of this world! Thou didst support\nthe earth in Thy Fish Incarnation for the deliverance of the Vedas! O Thou\nSatyavrata of the form of a Fish! We bow down to Thee. O Thou! The Enemy of\nthe Daityas! The Ocean of mercy! Thou dost do the actions of the Devas out of\nmercy. O Thou! the Tortoise Incarnation! That grantest Mukti to others!\nObeisance to Thee!\n\n\n\n6-18. O Thou! That didst assume the form of a Boar for the destruction of the\nDaityas Jaya and others and for raising the earth from the waters! Obeisance\nto Thee! Thou didst assume that form - Half man and half Lion of the Nrisimha\nMurti and tore asunder\n\n\n\np. 1029\n\n\n\nHira _n_ ya Kas'ipu, proud of his boons, by Thy nails. We bow down to Thee!\nObeisance to Thee! That in Thy Dwarf Incarnation, didst deceive Bali, whose\nhead got crazed by the acquisition of the kingdom over the three Lokas. We bow\ndown to Thee, that in Thy Paras'u Rama Incarnation, didst slay Karta\nViryaryuna, the thousand handed, and the other wicked K _s_ attriyas!\nObeisance to Thee! That wert born of the womb of Re _n_ uka as the son of\nJamadagni. Obeisance to Thee, of great prowess and valour, that in Thy Rama\nIncarnation as the son of Das'aratha, didst cut off the heads of the wicked\nRak _s_ asa, the son of Pulastya! We bow down again and again to Thee, the\nGreat Lord, that in Thy Kri _sn_ a incarnation, didst deliver this earth from\nthe clutches of the wicked King Duryodhana, Kam _s_ a and others and didst\nestablish the religion by removing the then prevailing vicious ideas and\ndoctrines. We bow down to Thy Buddha Incarnation, that Great Deva who didst\ncome down here to put a stop to the slaughtering of the innocent animals and\nto the performance of the wicked sacrificial ceremonies! Obeisance to the\nDeva! When almost all the persons in this world will turn out in future as\nMlechchas and when the wicked Kings will oppress them, right and left, Thou\nwilt then incarnate Thyself again as Kalki and redress all the grievances! We\nbow down to Thy Kalki Form! O Deva! These are Thy Ten Incarnations, for the\npreservation of Thy devotees, for the killing of the wicked Daityas. Therefore\nThou art called as the Great Reliever of all our troubles. O Thou! Victory to\nThee! The Deva Who assumest the forms of women and water for destroying the\nailings of the devotees! Who else can be so kind! O Thou, the Ocean of mercy!\xc2\x94\nO Ri _s_ is! Thus praising the yellow robed Vi _sn_ u, the Lord of all the\nDevas, the whole host of the Devas bowed down to Him and made Shas _t_ amgas.\nThen Vi _sn_ u Gadadhara, hearing their hymns, gladdened them and spoke :--\n\n\n\n19-27. S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavana said :-- \xc2\x93O Devas! I am pleased with your stotra. You\nneed not be sorrowful. I will remove all your troubles that have become\nunbearable to you. O Devas! I am very glad to hear the praises that you have\noffered on Me. Better ask boons from Me. I will grant them though very rare\neven and obtained with difficulty. Any person who rises early in the morning\nand recites with devotion this stotra sung by you, will never experience any\nsorrow. O Devas! No poverty, no bad symptoms, no Vetalas nor planets nor\nBrahma Rak _s_ asas nor any misfortunes will overtake him. No disease, due to\nVata (windy temperament), Pitta (bile) and Kapha (phlegm) nor untimely death\nwill visit him. His family will not\n\n\n\np. 1030\n\n\n\nbe extinct and happiness will always reign there. O Devas! This stotra can\ngive everything. Both the enjoyment and freedom will come within anyone's easy\naccess. There is no doubt in this. Nov what is your difficulty? Give out. I\nwill remove it at once. There is not a bit of doubt in this.\xc2\x94 Hearing these\nwords of S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan, the Devas became glad and spoke to Vi _sn_ u.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fifth Chapter of the Tenth Book on the Devas' going to Vi _sn_\nu, in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar\n_s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 6](bk10ch06.htm)\n\n"
