 \nThose who on hills their vigil hold,  \nOr dripping clothes around them fold:  \nThe devotees who live for prayer,  \nOr the five fires  4 unflinching bear.  \nOn contemplation all intent,  \nWith light that heavenly knowledge lent,  \nThey came to Rama, saint and sage,  \nIn S'arabhaga's hermitage.  \nThe hermit crowd around him pressed,  \nAnd thus the virtuous chief addressed:  \n'The lordship of the earth is thine,  \nO Prince of old Ikshvaku's line.  \n\nLord of the Gods is Indra, so  \nThou art our lord and guide below.  \nThy name, the glory of thy might,  \nThroughout the triple world are bright:  \nThy filial love so nobly shown.  \nThy truth and virtue well are known.  \nTo thee, O lord, for help we fly,  \nAnd on thy love of right rely:  \nWith kindly patience hear us speak,  \nAnd grant the boon we humbly seek.  \nThat lord of earth were most unjust,  \nFoul traitor to his solemn trust,  \nWho should a sixth of all  1b require,  \nNor guard his people like a sire.  \nBut he who ever watchful strives  \nTo guard his subjects' wealth and lives,  \nDear as himself or, dearer still,  \nHis sons, with earnest heart and will,--  \nThat king, O Raghu's son, secures  \nHigh fame that endless years endures,  \nAnd he to Brahma's world shall rise,  \nMade glorious in the eternal skies,  \nWhate'er, by duty won, the meed  \nOf saints whom roots and berries feed,  \nOne fourth thereof, for tender care  \nOf subjects, is the monarch's share.  \nThese, mostly of the Brahman race,  \nWho make the wood their dwelling-place,  \nAlthough a friend in thee they view,  \nFall friendless neath the giant crew.  \nCome, Rama, come, and see hard by  \nThe holy hermits' corpses lie,  \nWhere many a tangled pathway shows  \nThe murderous work of cruel foes.  \nThese wicked fiends the hermits kill--  \nWho live on Chitrakuta's hill,  \nAnd blood of slaughtered saints has dyed  \nMandakini and Pampa's side.  \nNo longer can we bear to see  \nThe death of saint and devotee  \nWhom through the forest day by day  \nThese Rakshases unpitying slay.  \nTo thee, O Prince, we flee, and crave  \nThy guardian help our lives to save.  \nFrom these fierce rovers of the night  \nDefend each stricken anchorite.  \nThroughout the world 'twere vain to seek  \nAn arm like thine to aid the weak.  \nO Prince, we pray thee hear our call,  \nAnd from these fiends preserve us all.'  \n   The son of Raghu heard the plaint  \nOf penance-loving sage and saint,  \nAnd the good prince his speech renewed  \nTo all the hermit multitude:  \n   'To me, O saints, ye need not sue:  \nI wait the hests of all of you.  \nI by mine own occasion led  \nThis mighty forest needs must tread,  \n\np. 236  \n\nAnd while I keep my sire's decree  \nYour lives from threatening foes will free.  \nI hither came of free accord  \nTo lend the aid by you implored,  \nAnd richest meed my toil shall pay,  \nWhile here in forest shades I stay.  \nI long in battle strife to close.  \nAnd slay these fiends, the hermits' foes,  \nThat saint and sage may learn aright  \nMy prowess and my brother's might.'  \n   Thus to'the saints his promise gave  \nThat prince who still to virtue clave  \n   With never-wandering thought:  \nAnd then with Lakshman by his side,  \nWith penance-wealthy men to guide,  \n   Sutikshna's home he sought.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[235:1](ry204.htm#fr_415) Hermits who live upon roots which they dig out of\nthe earth: literally _diggers_ , derived from the prefix _vi_ and _khan_ to\ndig.\n\n[235:2](ry204.htm#fr_416) Generally, divine personages of the height of a\nman's thumb, produced from Brahma's hair: here, according to the commentator\nfollowed by Gorresio, hermits who when they have obtained fresh food throw\naway what they had laid up before.\n\n[235:3](ry204.htm#fr_417) Sprung from the washings of Vishnu's feet.\n\n[235:4](ry204.htm#fr_418) Four fires burning round them, and the sun above.\n\n[235:1b](ry204.htm#fr_419) The tax allowed to the king by the Laws of Manu.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto VII.: Sutikshna.](ry205.htm)\n\n"
