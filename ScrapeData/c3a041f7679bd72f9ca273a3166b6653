Or else there is no contradiction (implied in our opinion); as in the\ncase of mantras and the like.\n\nOr else we may put the matter as follows. There is no reason whatever to\nsuspect a contradiction if we declare certain vidyas enjoined in one _S_ akha\nto be valid for the udgitha and so on belonging to other _S_ akhas also; for\nthere is no more room for contradiction than in the case of mantras. We\nobserve that mantras, acts, and qualities of acts which are enjoined in one\n_S_ akha are taken over by other _S_ akhas also. So e.g. the members of\ncertain Ya _g_ ur-veda _S_ akhas do not exhibit in their text the mantra,\n'Thou art the ku _t_ aru 1', which accompanies the taking of the stone (with\nwhich the rice-grains are ground); all the same we meet in their text with the\nfollowing injunction of application, 'Thou art the cock, with this mantra he\ntakes the stone; or else with the mantra, Thou art the ku _t_ aru.'\n\np. 274\n\nAgain, the text of some _S_ akha does not contain a direct injunction of the\nfive offerings called praya _g_ as which are made to the fuel and so on, but\nit contains the injunction of secondary matters connected with the praya _g_\nas, viz. in the passage, 'the seasons indeed are the praya _g_ as; they are to\nbe offered in one and the same spot [1](sbe38200.htm#fn_171).'--Again, the\ntext of some _S_ akha does not contain an injunction as to the species of the\nanimal to be sacrificed to Agnishomau--such as would be 'a he-goat is\nsacrificed to Agnishomau [2](sbe38200.htm#fn_172);'--but in the same _S_ akha\nwe meet with a mantra which contains the required specification, 'Hot _ri_ ',\nrecite the anuvakya, for the fat of the omentum of the he-goat\n[3](sbe38200.htm#fn_173).' Similarly mantras enjoined in one Veda only, such\nas 'O Agni, promote the hautra, promote the sacrifice,' are seen to be taken\nover into other Vedas also. Another example (of the transference of mantras)\nis supplied by the hymn, 'He who as soon as born showed himself intelligent,'\n&c. ( _Ri_ _k_. Sa _m_ h. II, 12), which although read in the text of the Bahv\n_ri_ kas is employed in the Taittiriya Veda also, according to Taitt. Sa _m_\nh. VII, 5, 5, 2, 'The Sa _g_ aniya hymn is to be recited.'--Just as,\ntherefore, the members of sacrificial actions on which certain vidyas rest are\nvalid everywhere, so the vidyas themselves also which rest on those members\nare valid for all _S_ akhas and Vedas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[273:1](sbe38199.htm#fr_170) Maitraya _n_ iya Sa _m_ hita I, 1, 6.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 57](sbe38200.htm)\n\n"
