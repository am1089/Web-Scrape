Conductors, this being indicated.\n\nThe decision here is that light, Vayu, and the rest mentioned in the texts as\nconnected with the soul's progress on the path of the Gods are to be\ninterpreted not as mere marks indicating the road, nor as places of enjoyment\nfor the soul, but as divinities appointed by the Supreme Person to conduct the\nsoul along the stages of the road; for this is indicated by what the _Kh_\nandogya. says with regard to the last stage, viz. lightning, 'There is a\nperson not human, he leads them to Brahman.' What here is said as to that\nperson not human, viz. that he leads the soul, is to be extended to the other\nbeings also, light and the rest.--But if that not human person leads the souls\nfrom lightning to Brahman, what then about Varu _n_ a, Indra, and Pra _g_\napati, who, as was decided above, are in charge of stages beyond lightning? Do\nthey also lead the soul along their stages?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 5. From thence by him only who belongs to lightning](sbe48541.htm)\n\n"
