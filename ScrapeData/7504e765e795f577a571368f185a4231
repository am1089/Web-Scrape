That host, with speed,  \nQuadruple, as the king decreed,  \nWith priests to head the bright array,  \nFollowed the monarch on his way.  \nFour days they travelled on the road,  \nAnd eve Videha's kingdom showed.  \nJanak had left his royal seat  \nThe venerable king to greet,  \nAnd, noblest, with these words addressed  \nThat noblest lord, his happy guest:  \n'Hail, best of kings: a blessed fate  \nHas led thee, Monarch, to my state.  \nThy sons, supreme in high emprise,  \nWill gladden now their father's eyes.  \nAnd high my fate, that hither leads  \nVas'ishtha, bright with holy deeds,  \nGirt with these sages far-renowned,  \nLike Indra with the Gods around.  \nJoy! joy! for vanquished are my foes:  \nJoy! for my house in glory grows,  \nWith Raghu's noblest sons allied,  \nSupreme in strength and valour's pride.  \nTo-morrow with its early light  \nWill shine on my completed rite.  \nThen, sanctioned by the saints and thee,  \nThe marriage of thy Rama see.'  \n\nThen Das'aratha, best of those  \nWhose speech in graceful order flows,  \nWith gathered saints on every side,  \nThus to the lord of earth replied:  \n'A truth is this I long have known,  \nA favour is the giver's own.  \nWhat thou shalt bid, O good and true,  \nWe, as our power permits, will do.'  \n\nThat answer of the truthful lord,  \nWith virtuous worth and honour stored,  \nJanak, Videha's noble king,  \nHeard gladly, greatly marvelling.  \nWith bosoms filled with pleasure met  \nLong-parted saint and anchoret,  \nAnd linked in friendship's tie they spent  \nThe peaceful night in great content.  \n\nRama and Lakshman thither sped,  \nBy sainted Vis'vamitra led,  \nAnd bent in filial love to greet  \nTheir father, and embraced his feet.  \nThe aged king, rejoiced to hear  \nAnd see again his children dear,  \nHonoured by Janak's thoughtful care,  \nWith great enjoyment rested there.  \nKing Janak, with attentive heed,  \nConsulted first his daughters' need,  \nAnd ordered all to speed the rite;  \nThen rested also for the night.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXX.: The Maidens Sought.](ry070.htm)\n\n"
