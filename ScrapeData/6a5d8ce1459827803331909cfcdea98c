They now remove two burning samidhs (from the \xc3\x82havaniya fire). That\nfire, indeed, is now worn out, (and therefore useless) for the after-\nofferings, since it has been carrying the sacrifice to the gods: 'Let us\nperform the after-offerings in such (fire) as is not out-worn!' thus they\nthink, and for this reason they remove those two burning samidhs (from the\nfire).\n\n1:8:2:22\\. Thereupon they again move them close (to the fire). Thereby they\ncause the fire to increase again and to be no longer out-worn: 'Let us perform\nwhat part of the sacrifice remains still unaccomplished in such (fire) as is\nnot out-worn!' so think they, and for this reason they again move them close\n(to the fire).\n\n1:8:2:33\\. He (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) then puts on the kindling-stick\n\np. 231\n\n[paragraph continues] (which was reserved at the time of kindling) 1. He\nthereby kindles that (fire): 'Let us perform in the well-kindled (fire) what\npart of the sacrifice remains unaccomplished!' thus he thinks, and for this\nreason he puts on the samidh.\n\n1:8:2:44\\. The Hot _ri_ consecrates it (the kindling-stick), with the formula\n(Va _g_. S. II, 14 a), 'This, O Agni, is thy kindler; mayest thou grow and\nincrease by it; and may we also grow and increase!' for even as before he\nrecited over the fire when it was being kindled, so also now he recites. This\nis the Hot _ri_ 's duty; but the sacrificer himself may pronounce the\nconsecratory formula, if he think that the Hot _ri_ does not know it 2.\n\n1:8:2:55\\. He (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) then sweeps (the fire) together. He thereby\nharnesses it: 'Thus harnessed, may it convey (to the gods) what part of the\nsacrifice still remains unaccomplished!' thus he thinks, and for this reason\nhe sweeps it together. He sweeps\n\np. 232\n\nonce (with the band of the fire-wood along each of the three enclosing-\nsticks); for thrice each time they swept for the gods on the former occasion\n1: 'Lest we should do it in the same way as for the gods;' thus he thinks, and\naccordingly he sweeps once each time in order to avoid repetition (of\nsacrificial performance). Repetition the would undoubtedly commit, if he were\nto sweep thrice the first time and thrice the second: for this reason he\nsweeps once (along each stick).\n\n1:8:2:66\\. He sweeps (each time), with the formula (Va _g_. S. II, 14 b), 'O\nAgni, food-gainer, I cleanse thee, the food-gainer, who hast hastened to the\nfood!' On the former occasion he said, 'thee who art about to hasten (to the\nfood),' for on that occasion he was indeed about to hasten thither; now,\nhowever, he says, 'who hast hastened (to the food),' for now he has indeed\nhastened thither: for this reason he says 'thee who hast hastened.'\n\n1:8:2:77\\. He now makes the after-offerings. Whatever gods he invokes by means\nof this sacrifice, and for whichever of them this sacrifice is performed, to\nall offering has now been made; and to all those to whom offering has been\nmade, he now, after that, offers once more: hence the name 'after-offerings.'\n\n1:8:2:88\\. Now this is why he makes the after-offerings. The after-offerings\nassuredly are the metres 2, and the metres are the cattle of the gods: hence\nas cattle, when harnessed, here convey (burdens) for men, so in like manner\nthe metres, being harnessed,\n\np. 233\n\nconvey the sacrifice to the gods. Now the occasion on which the metres\ngratified the gods, and for which the gods, in their turn, then gratified the\nmetres, was when before this the metres, on being harnessed, conveyed the\nsacrifice to the gods and thereby gratified them.\n\n1:8:2:99\\. And this again is why he makes the after-offerings. The after-\nofferings are the metres: hence he thereby gratifies the metres, and for this\nreason also he makes the after-offerings. By whatever team, therefore, he has\nhimself drawn, that (team) he would thereby unyoke, saying, 'Give it to drink,\nfeed it well!' and thus his team is propitiated.\n\n1:8:2:1010\\. In the first place he makes offering to the Barhis (sacrificial-\ngrass covering). Though the smallest metre, the gayatri is yoked first of the\nmetres 1; and this on account of its strength, since, having become a falcon,\nit carried off the Soma from heaven 2. They consider it unseemly, however,\nthat the gayatri, being the smallest metre, should be yoked first of the\nmetres; and the gods accordingly arranged the metres here, at the after-\nofferings, so as it ought to be, 'lest there should be a confusion.'\n\n1:8:2:1111\\. In the first place, then, he offers to the Barhis. The Barhis\nindeed is this world; the Barhis is the plants: hence he thereby bestows\nplants on this world, and these plants are firmly rooted in this world. Now\nthis entire universe ( _g_ agat) is contained in this (metre), and therefore\nthe latter is (called) _g_ agati: this is why they have placed the _g_ agati\nmetre first.\n\n1:8:2:1212\\. In the second place he offers to Nara _s_ a _m_ sa.\n\np. 234\n\n[paragraph continues] Now, Nara _s_ a _m_ sa is the air. Man (nara), namely,\nmeans (human) being; and these same beings move about in the air speaking\naloud. And when he (man) speaks, they say 'he chants (sa _m_ s);' and\ntherefore Nara _s_ a _m_ sa is the air 1. But the trish _t_ ubh also is the\nair 2, and for this reason they have placed the trish _t_ ubh second.\n\n1:8:2:1313\\. Then Agni is the last (to whom offering is made). Agni assuredly\nis the gayatri; and therefore they placed the gayatri last. In this way they\nestablished the metres in complete and proper order; and hence no confusion\nhere takes place.\n\n1:8:2:1414\\. The Adhvaryu 3 says (to the Hot _ri_ ), 'Pronounce the offering-\nprayer (ya _g_ ya) to the gods!' and the Hot _ri_ (begins his prayer) at all\n(the three offerings) with 'The divine . . . .' For the metres assuredly are\nthe gods of the gods, since they are their cattle, and cattle means a home,\nand a home is a safe resting-place. The after-offerings, doubtless, are the\nmetres: therefore the Adhvaryu says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the\ngods!' and at all of them the Hot _ri_ begins with 'The divine . . . 4.'\n\np. 235\n\n1:8:2:1515\\. ['The divine Barhis (or Nara _s_ a _m_ sa) may accept (the\noffering)] for abundant obtainment of abundant gift! [Vausha _t_!]' For a\ndeity only the vasha _t_ -call is pronounced, to a deity only offering is\nmade; but here at the after-offerings there is no (proper) deity 1. When he\nsays 'The divine Barhis,' in this there is neither Agni, nor Indra, nor Soma;\nwhen he says 'The divine Nara _s_ a _m_ sa,' neither is there in this anything\nwhatever (of the nature of a god); and what Agni there is (in the third\noffering-prayer), he indeed is virtually the gayatri.\n\n1:8:2:1616\\. The reason, then, why he offers with the formula 'for abundant\nobtainment of abundant gift 2,'\n\np. 236\n\nis that Agni is the obtainer of wealth, and Indra is the recipient of wealth;\nand Indra and Agni are indeed the (joint) divinity of the metres: and in this\nway it is for a deity that the vasha _t_ is pronounced, and to a deity that\nthe offering is made.\n\n1:8:2:1717\\. After he has made the last after-offering, he pours together (the\nbutter which remains in the upabh _ri_ t with that which attaches to the _g_\nuhu), and offers it (by pouring it from the _g_ uhu in a line from west to\neast into the fire). For doubtless these are the after-offerings to the fore-\nofferings: hence even as there, at the fore-offerings 1, he makes the spiteful\nenemy pay tribute to the sacrificer, and the one to be consumed pay tribute to\nthe consumer; so now he makes him pay tribute at the after-offerings.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[231:1](sbe1235.htm#fr_544) See I, 4, 1, 38. The Adhvaryu takes the fresh\nstick (samidh), asks the permission of the Brahman to step forward for the\nafter-offerings; and orders the \xc3\x82gnidhra to put the stick on, and trim, the\nfire. Whilst the Brahman mutters his formula (Va _g_. S. II, 12-13), 'This thy\nsacrifice, O divine Savit _ri_ , they proclaimed to B _ri_ haspati, the\nBrahman,' &c. (see I, 7, 4, 21), the \xc3\x82gnidhra executes the Adhvaryu's orders.\nKaty. III, 5, I; II, 2, 21.\n\n[231:2](sbe1235.htm#fr_545) That is to say (as would appear), if the Hot _ri_\nfollows a school which does not recognise this particular ceremony as\nbelonging to the Hot _ri_ 's ritual. Thus the \xc3\x82 _s_ val. _S_ r. makes no\nmention of it, and hence a Hot _ri_ belonging to the _S_ akala or Bashkala _s_\nakhas would not undertake the recitation of this consecratory formula. The\nSa\xe1\xb9\x85khay. _S_ r., on the other hand, does prescribe it (cf. Hillebrandt, Neu-\nand Volim. p. 135, note 4), and a Hot _ri_ of the Kaushitaki- _s_ akha would\naccordingly claim it as his privilege or duty to consecrate the samidh. For a\nsomewhat different view, cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 155; V, 408.\n\n[232:1](sbe1235.htm#fr_546) See I, 4, 4, 14. While, on the former occasion,\nthe \xc3\x82gnidhra in sweeping moved round the fire, on the present occasion he\nremains standing on the north side of it. Katy. III, 5, 4.\n\n[232:2](sbe1235.htm#fr_547) See I, 3, 2, 8, 9.\n\n[233:1](sbe1235.htm#fr_548) See, for instance, I, 3, 4, 6.\n\n[233:2](sbe1235.htm#fr_549) For this myth, see I, 7, 1, 1.\n\n[234:1](sbe1235.htm#fr_550) That is, because man (nara) speaks, chants, ( _s_\namsati) in it.\n\n[234:2](sbe1235.htm#fr_551) Either because both are in the middle (viz. the\ntrish _t_ ubh of the three chief metres, and the air between heaven and\nearth), or because they consist of eleven parts (viz. the trish _t_ ubh of\neleven syllables, and the air having ten directions, _S_ at. Br. VI, 2, 2, 34;\nVIII, 4; 2, 13, with itself as the eleventh), or because they are both\nconnected with Rudra. Comm.\n\n[234:3](sbe1235.htm#fr_552) As on previous occasions, the Adhvaryu first calls\non the \xc3\x82gnidhra, 'Bid (Agni) hear (o _s_ ravaya)!' and the latter responds by\n'Yea, may (he) hear (astu _s_ rausha _t_ )!' This is repeated before each of\nthe two other after-offerings. See I, 5, 2, 16.\n\n[234:4](sbe1235.htm#fr_553) The drift of the argument of this paragraph is not\nquite clear to me. The after-offerings have for their deities the metres, and\nhence the latter are apparently called the deities of the deities, that is, of\nthe p. 235 recipients of the offerings. The difference between the fore-\nofferings and after-offerings in regard to the offering-formula lies in this,\nthat at the first fore-offering the Adhvaryu, in calling on the Hot _ri_ ,\nnames the particular object of the offering, viz. 'Pronounce the offering-\nprayer to the samidhs!' while for the remaining praya _g_ as he merely calls\n'Pronounce the offering-prayer!' and the Hot _ri_ begins all his prayers\n(after the introductory agur-formula) with the name of the respective\nrecipient of the oblation. At the after-offering, on the other hand, the\nAdhvaryu calls each time, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the gods' (or,\naccording to Katy. III, 5, 8, optionally without 'to the gods,' the second and\nthird times), and the Hot _ri_ 's prayers begin with 'The divine (Barhis, or\nNara _s_ a _m_ sa, or Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t) . . .: See I, 5, 3, 8 seq.\n\n[235:1](sbe1235.htm#fr_554) Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t, the recipient of the\nthird after-offering, is, as we saw, regarded as representing the gayatri\nmetre.\n\n[235:2](sbe1235.htm#fr_555) Vasuvane vasudheyasya.(vetu); perhaps better, as\nSaya _n_ a, on Taitt. S. II, 6, 9, takes it, 'May he partake of the gift of\nwealth for the (sacrificer's) obtainment of wealth.' 'For the wealth-desirer\nof wealth-gift' = 'for the desirer of wealth-possession,' St. Petersb. Dict.\nOur author apparently takes it in the sense of 'for the obtainer of wealth and\nfor the receiver of wealth;' and Mahidhara (Va _g_. S. XXII, 48; XXVIII, 12)\ninterprets it 'for the giving (or obtainment) of wealth and for the depositing\nof treasure (i.e. for burying a treasure in the sacrificer's house!)'\nHarisvamin takes vasuvaue as vocative; but the accent is against his view.\n\n[236:1](sbe1235.htm#fr_556) See I, 5, 3, 18.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 8, 3.
