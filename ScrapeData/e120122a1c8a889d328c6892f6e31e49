On account of difference in deep sleep and departing.\n\nWe have to supply 'on account of designation' from the preceding Sutra.\nBecause the text designates the highest Self as something different from the\nindividual Self in the state of deep sleep as well as at the time of\ndeparture, the highest Self is thus different. For the Va _g_ asaneyaka, after\nhaving introduced the individual Self in the passage 'Who is that Self?--He\nwho consisting of knowledge is among the pra _n_ as,' &c. (B _ri._ Up. IV, 3,\n7), describes how, in the state of deep sleep, being not conscious of anything\nit is held embraced by the all-knowing highest Self, embraced by the\nintelligent Self it knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within'\n(IV, 3, 21). So also with reference to the time of departure, i.e. dying\n'Mounted by the intelligent Self it moves along groaning' (IV, 3, 35). Now it\nis impossible that the unconscious individual Self, either lying in deep sleep\nor departing from the body, should at the same time be embraced or mounted by\nitself, being all-knowing. Nor can the embracing and mounting Self be some\nother individual Self; for no such Self can be all-knowing.--The next Sutra\nsupplies a further reason.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 44.
