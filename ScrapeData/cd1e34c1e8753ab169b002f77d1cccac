A penance (shall be performed) for an offence committed unintentionally. 1\n\n2\\. Some (declare that it shall be performed) also for (a fault) committed\nintentionally.\n\n3\\. \'The spiritual teacher corrects the learned; the king corrects the evil-\nminded; but Yama, the son of Vivasvat, forsooth, punishes those who offend\nsecretly.\'\n\n4\\. And among those (sinful persons), let him who slept at sunrise stand\nduring the (following) day and recite the verse sacred to Savit _ri_. 4\n\np. 103\n\n5\\. Let him who slept at sunset remain in a sitting posture during the (next)\nnight, likewise (reciting the Gayatri). 5\n\n6\\. But let a man with deformed nails or black teeth perform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_\nra penance of twelve days\' duration. 6\n\n7\\. He whose younger brother married first shall perform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra\npenance during twelve days, marry and take to himself even that (woman whom\nhis brother wedded). 7\n\n8\\. Now he who has taken a wife before his elder brother shall perform a K\n_ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance and an Atik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance, give (his wife)\nto that (elder brother), marry again, and take (back) the same (woman whom he\nwedded first).\n\n9\\. The husband of a younger sister married before her elder sister shall\nperform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance during twelve days, marry and take to him\nthat (elder sister).\n\n10\\. The husband of an elder sister married after the younger one shall\nperform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance and an Atik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance,\ngive (his wife) to that (husband of the younger sister and marry again). 10\n\np. 104\n\n11\\. We shall, declare below (the penance prescribed for) him who extinguishes\nthe sacred fire. 11\n\n12\\. He who has forgot the Veda (by neglecting to recite it daily), shall\nperform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance of twelve days\' duration, and again learn\nit from his teacher. 12\n\n13\\. He who violates a Guru\'s bed shall cut off his organ, together with the\ntesticles, take them into his joined hands and walk towards the south wherever\nhe meets with an obstacle (to further progress), there he shall stand until he\ndies: 13\n\n14\\. Or, having shaved all his hair and smeared his body with clarified\nbutter, he shall embrace the heated (iron) image (of a woman). It is declared\nin the Veda that he is. purified after death, 14\n\n15\\. The same (expiation is prescribed if the offence was committed) with the\nwife of the teacher, of a son, and of a pupil. 15\n\n16\\. If he has had intercourse with a female (who is considered) venerable in\nthe family, with a female friend, with the female friend of a Guru, with an\nApapatra female, or with an outcast, he shall perform a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra\npenance during three months. 16\n\n17\\. The same (penance must be performed) for eating food given by a _K_ a _n_\n_d_ ala or by an outcast. Afterwards the initiation (must be performed) once\nmore; but the tonsure and the rest may be omitted.\n\np. 105\n\n18\\. And with reference to this (matter) they quote a verse proclaimed by\nManu, \'The tonsure, (the tying on of) the sacred girdle, (the wearing of) a\nstaff, and the begging of alias, these acts may be omitted on a second\ninitiation.\' 18\n\n19\\. If (a Brahma _n_ a) intentionally (drinks) other spirituous liquor than\nthat distilled from rice, or if he unintentionally (drinks) spirituous liquor\nextracted from rice (sura), he (must perform) a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra and an Atik\n_ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra, and, after eating clarified butter, be initiated again. 19\n\n20\\. The same (expiation is prescribed) for swallowing ordure, urine, and\nsemen.\n\n21\\. If a Brahma _n_ a drinks water which has stood in a vessel used for\n(keeping) spirituous liquor, he becomes pure by drinking, during three days,\nwater (mixed with a decoction) of lotus, Udumbara, Bilva, and Pala _s_ a\n(leaves). 21\n\n22\\. But a Brahma _n_ a who repeatedly (and intentionally partakes) of liquor\nextracted from rice, shall drink (liquor of) the same (kind) boiling hot. \'He\nbecomes pure after death.\' 22\n\n23\\. We will declare (who must be considered) the slayer of a learned Brahma\n_n_ a (bhru _n_ ahan). He is called Bhru _n_ ahan who kills a Brahma _n_ a or\ndestroys an embryo (the sex of) which is unknown. 23\n\n24\\. \'For embryos (the sex of) which is unknown 24\n\np. 106\n\nbecome males; therefore they offer burnt-oblations for the production of\nmales.\'\n\n25\\. Let the slayer of a learned Brahma _n_ a kindle a fire and offer (therein\nthe following eight oblations, consisting of portions of his own body), 25\n\n26\\. The first (saying), \'I offer my hair to Death, I feed Death with my\nhair;\' the second (saying), I offer my skin to Death, I feed Death with my\nskin;\' the third (saying), \'I offer my blood to Death, I feed Death with my\nblood;\' the fourth (saying), I offer my flesh to Death, I feed Death with my\nflesh;\' the fifth (saying), \'I offer my sinews to Death, I feed Death with my\nsinews;\' the sixth (saying), \'I offer my fat to Death, I feed Death with my\nfat;\' the seventh (saying), \'I offer my bones to Death, I feed Death with my\nbones;\' the eighth (saying), \'I offer my marrow to Death, I feed Death with my\nmarrow.\'\n\n27\\. (Or) let him (fight) for the sake of the king, or for the sake of Brahma\n_n_ as, and let him die in battle with his face turned (to the foe). 27\n\n28\\. It is declared in the Veda, \'(A murderer) who remains thrice unvanquished\nor is thrice defeated (in battle) becomes pure.\' 28\n\n29\\. \'A sin which is openly proclaimed becomes smaller.\' 29\n\np. 107\n\n30\\. To this (effect) they quote also (the following verse): \'By saying to an\noutcast, "O thou outcast!" or to a thief, "O thou thief!" a man incurs a guilt\nas great as (that of the offender). (If he) falsely (accuses anybody of such\noffences), his guilt will be twice as great.\' 30\n\n31\\. In like manner having slain a Kshatriya, he shall perform (a penance)\nduring eight years, 31\n\n32\\. For (killing) a Vai _s_ ya during six (years), 32\n\n33\\. For (killing) a _S_ udra, during three (years), 33\n\n34\\. For killing a female of the Brahma _n_ a caste who is an Atreyi, and a\nKshatriya or a Vai _s_ ya, engaged in a sacrifice (the same penance must be\nperformed as for killing a learned Brahma _n_ a). 34\n\n35\\. We will explain (the term) Atreyi. They declare that she who has bathed\nafter temporary uncleanness is an Atreyi.\n\n36\\. \'For if (the husband) approaches her at that (time), he will have\noffspring.\' 36\n\np. 108\n\n37\\. (For killing a female of the Brahma _n_ a caste) who is not an \xc3\x82treyi,\n(the penance prescribed) for the murder of a Kshatriya (must be performed), 37\n\n38\\. (For killing) a female of the Kshatriya caste, (the penance prescribed)\nfor the murder of a Vai _s_ ya,\n\n39\\. (For killing) a female of the Vai _s_ ya caste, (the penance prescribed)\nfor the murder of a _S_ udra.\n\n40\\. (For killing) a female of the _S_ udra caste (let him perform) during one\nyear (the penance prescribed for the murder of a Brahma _n_ a).\n\n41\\. If a man has stolen gold belonging to a Brahma _n_ a, he shall run, with\nflying hair, to the king, (exclaiming) \'Ho, I am a thief; sir, punish me!\' The\nking shall give him a weapon made of Udumbara wood; with that he shall kill\nhimself. It is declared in the Veda that he becomes pure after death. 41\n\n42\\. Or (such a thief) may shave off all his hair, anoint his body with\nclarified butter, and cause himself to be burnt from the feet upwards, in a\nfire of dry cowdung. It is declared in the Veda that he becomes pure after\ndeath. 42\n\n43\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): \'Hear, (how) the bodies of\nthose who having committed various crimes died a long time ago, and were\n(afterwards) born again, are (marked);\'\n\np. 109\n\n44\\. \'A thief will have deformed nails, the murderer of a Brahma _n_ a will be\nafflicted with white leprosy, but he who has drunk spirituous liquor will have\nblack teeth, and the violator of his Guru\'s bed will suffer from skin\ndiseases.\' 44\n\n45\\. Property received from outcasts, after forming alliances with them either\nby (teaching) the Veda (and by sacrificing) or by marriage, must be\nrelinquished. Let him not associate with such (men). 45\n\n46\\. It is declared in the Veda that (he who has associated with outcasts)\nbecomes pure by reciting the Sa _m_ hita (of his Veda), proceeding in a\nnortherly direction and fasting. 46\n\n47\\. They quote also (a verse) to this (effect), \'A sinner is liberated from\nguilt by tormenting his body, by austerities, and by reciting the Veda; he\nbecomes also free by bestowing gifts. That has been declared in the Veda.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[102:1](sbe1423.htm#fr_581)-2. **XX**.

Manu XI, 201.\n\n[103:6](sbe1423.htm#fr_584) Regarding the K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance, see\nbelow, XXI, 20.\n\n[103:7](sbe1423.htm#fr_585)-8. Vish _n_ u LIV, 16. According to K _ri_ sh _n_\napa _n_ _d_ ita both brothers shall perform penances. The elder brother shall\nmarry after his penance is finished. The younger one shall offer his wife to\nthe elder, in order to atone for the slur put upon the elder. The latter shall\naccept her for form\'s sake and return her to the younger brother, who must\nonce more wed her. Regarding the Atik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance, see below,\nXXIV, 2.\n\n[103:10](sbe1423.htm#fr_586) Vish _n_ u LIV, 16. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\nthinks that he should marry another wife, but adds that others say that, after\noffering his wife to the husband of the younger sister and receiving his\npermission he should wed her once more.\n\n[104:11](sbe1423.htm#fr_587) See below, XXI, 27.\n\n[104:12](sbe1423.htm#fr_588) Vish _n_ u LIV, 13.\n\n[104:13](sbe1423.htm#fr_589) Gautama XXIII, 10.\n\n[104:14](sbe1423.htm#fr_590) Gautama XXIII,\n\n[104:15](sbe1423.htm#fr_591)-16. Gautama XXIII, 12. 9, 11.\n\n[104:16](sbe1423.htm#fr_592) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita explains sakhim, \'a\nfemale friend,\' by \'a woman who has affection (for the offender), i.e. a\nsister and so forth.\' Apapatra are low-caste people, whose vessels must not be\nused; see \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 3, 25, note.\n\n[105:18](sbe1423.htm#fr_593) Identical with Manu XI, 152, and Vish _n_ u LI,\n5.\n\n[105:19](sbe1423.htm#fr_594)-20. Manu XI, 151; Vish _n_ u LI, 2. Regarding the\nother of liquors, see Manu XI, 95-96,\n\n[105:21](sbe1423.htm#fr_595) Manu XI, 148.\n\n[105:22](sbe1423.htm#fr_596) Gautama XXIII, 1.\n\n[105:23](sbe1423.htm#fr_597) Gautama XXII, 13. It must be understood a real\nBrahma _n_ a who knows the Veda is meant.\n\n[105:24](sbe1423.htm#fr_598) \'Therefore they offer burnt-oblations for the\nproduction of males,\' i.e. they perform the Pu _m_ savana, one of the\nsacraments; p. 107 see e _g_. \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I, 13. The Sutra is marked as a\nquotation, and probably belongs to some Vedic work.\n\n[106:25](sbe1423.htm#fr_599) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 12.\n\n[106:27](sbe1423.htm#fr_600) Gautama XXII, 8.\n\n[106:28](sbe1423.htm#fr_601) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 24, 21.\n\n[106:29](sbe1423.htm#fr_602) Taken by itself the Sutra would seem to refer to\nthe maxim that a free confession reduces the guilt of the offender (Manu XI,\n228). But on account of the next Sutra it is necessary to assume, with K _ri_\nsh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita, that half the guilt of a crime, of which another man\njustly accuses an offender, falls on the accuser, while the p. 107 offender\'s\nguilt becomes less by the publication of his misdeed. It is, however, not\nimprobable that the text is here defective, and one or several Sutras have\nbeen left out.\n\n[107:30](sbe1423.htm#fr_603) Gautama XXI, 17-18.\n\n[107:31](sbe1423.htm#fr_604) Vish _n_ u L, 12. The text is here evidently\ndefective. The Sutra or Sutras left out must have contained the description of\nanother penance for the murder of a Brahma _n_ a, which is mentioned in nearly\nall the Sm _ri_ tis (see Vish _n_ u L, 1-6, 15, and the parallel passages).\nIts chief conditions are, that the murderer is to live separate for twelve\nyears, and to subsist on alms given by people who are acquainted with his\ncrime. Without such an additional rule this and the following Sutras are\nutterly unintelligible.\n\n[107:32](sbe1423.htm#fr_605) Vish _n_ u L, 13.\n\n[107:33](sbe1423.htm#fr_606) Vish _n_ u L, 14.\n\n[107:34](sbe1423.htm#fr_607) Vish _n_ u L, 7, 9.\n\n[107:36](sbe1423.htm#fr_608) The author means to say that the word atreyi is\nderived from atra, at that time,\' and the verb i, \'to approach.\' The etymology\nis worthy of the Nirukta.\n\n[108:37](sbe1423.htm#fr_609)-40. Gautama XXII, 17.\n\n[108:41](sbe1423.htm#fr_610) Vish _n_ u LII, 1-2. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_\nita remarks that _S_ ulapa _n_ i explains audumbaram, \'made of Udumbara wood,\'\nby \'made of copper,\' and that the weapon intended is a club. The last remark\nis probably true, as the parallel passages of the other Sm _ri_ tis state that\nthe thief is to take a club to the king, with which he is to be struck.\n\n[108:42](sbe1423.htm#fr_611) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 25, 6.\n\n[109:44](sbe1423.htm#fr_612) Manu XI, 49; Vish _n_ u XLV, 4, 5, 6.\n\n[109:45](sbe1423.htm#fr_613) Vish _n_ u LIV, 28.\n\n[109:46](sbe1423.htm#fr_614) Manu XI, 194.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXI](sbe1424.htm)\n\n'
