(Brahman is) the material cause also, on account of (this view) not being\nin conflict with the promissory statements and the illustrative instances.\n\nIt has been said that, as practical religious duty has to be enquired into\nbecause it is the cause of an increase of happiness, so Brahman has to be\nenquired into because it is the cause of absolute beatitude. And Brahman has\nbeen defined as that from which there proceed the origination, sustentation,\nand retractation of this world. Now as this definition comprises alike the\nrelation of substantial causality in which clay and gold, for instance, stand\nto golden ornaments and earthen pots, and the relation of operative\n\np. 284\n\ncausality in which the potter and the goldsmith stand to the things mentioned;\na doubt arises to which of these two kinds the causality of Brahman belongs.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that Brahman, evidently is the operative cause of\nthe world only, because Scripture declares his creative energy to be preceded\nby reflection. Compare, for instance, Pra. Up. VI, 3; 4: 'He reflected, he\ncreated pra _n_ a.' For observation shows that the action of operative causes\nonly, such as potters and the like, is preceded by reflection, and moreover\nthat the result of some activity is brought about by the concurrence of\nseveral factors 1. It is therefore appropriate that we should view the prime\ncreator in the same light. The circumstance of his being known as 'the Lord'\nfurnishes another argument. For lords such as kings and the son of Vivasvat\nare known only as operative causes, and the highest Lord also must on that\naccount be viewed as an operative cause only.--Further, the effect of the\ncreator's activity, viz. this world, is seen to consist of parts, to be non-\nintelligent and impure; we therefore must assume that its cause also is of the\nsame nature; for it is a matter of general observation that cause and effect\nare alike in kind. But that Brahman does not resemble the world in nature, we\nknow from many scriptural passages, such as 'It is without parts, without\nactions, tranquil, without fault, without taint' _Sv_ e. Up. VI, 19). Hence\nthere remains no other alternative but to admit that in addition to Brahman\nthere exists a material cause of the world of impure nature, such as is known\nfrom Sm _ri_ ti 2, and to limit the causality of Brahman, as declared by\nScripture, to operative causality.\n\nTo this we make the following reply.--Brahman is to be acknowledged as the\nmaterial cause as well as the operative cause; because this latter view does\nnot conflict with the promissory statements and the illustrative instances.\nThe promissory statement chiefly meant is the following one,\n\np. 285\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Have you ever asked for that instruction by which that\nwhich is not heard becomes heard; that which is not perceived, perceived; that\nwhich is not known, known?'( _Kh_. Up. VI, 1, 3.) This passage intimates that\nthrough the cognition of one thing everything else, even if (previously)\nunknown, becomes known. Now the knowledge of everything is possible through\nthe cognition of the material cause, since the effect is non-different from\nthe material cause. On the other hand, effects are not non-different from\ntheir operative causes; for we know from ordinary experience that the\ncarpenter, for instance, is different from the house he has built.--The\nillustrative example referred to is the one mentioned ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 1, 4),\n'My dear, as by one clod of clay all that is made of clay is known, the\nmodification (i.e. the effect) being a name merely which has its origin in\nspeech, while the truth is that it is clay merely;' which passage again has\nreference to the material cause. The text adds a few more illustrative\ninstances of similar nature, 'As by one nugget of gold all that is made of\ngold is known; as by one pair of nail-scissors all that is made of iron is\nknown.'--Similar promissory statements are made in other places also, for\ninstance, 'What is that through which if it is known everything else becomes\nknown?' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 3.) An illustrative instance also is given in the same\nplace, 'As plants grow on the earth' (I, 1, 7).--Compare also the promissory\nstatement in B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 6, 'When the Self has been seen, heard,\nperceived, and known, then all this is known;' and the illustrative instance\nquoted (IV, 5, 8), 'Now as the sounds of a drum if beaten cannot be seized\nexternally, but the sound is seized when the drum is seized or the beater of\nthe drum.'--Similar promissory statements and illustrative instances which are\nto be found in all Vedanta-texts are to be viewed as proving, more or less,\nthat Brahman is also the material cause of the world. The ablative case also\nin the passage, 'That from whence (yata _h_ ) these beings are born,' has to\nbe considered as indicating the material cause of the beings, according to the\ngrammatical rule, Pa _n_. I, 4, 30.--That Brahman is at the same time the\noperative cause of the\n\np. 286\n\nworld, we have to conclude from the circumstance that there is no other\nguiding being. Ordinarily material causes, indeed, such as lumps of clay and\npieces of gold, are dependent, in order to shape themselves into vessels and\nornaments, on extraneous operative causes such as potters and goldsmiths; but\noutside Brahman as material cause there is no other operative cause to which\nthe material cause could look; for Scripture says that previously to creation\nBrahman was one without a second.--The absence of a guiding principle other\nthan the material cause can moreover be established by means of the argument\nmade use of in the Sutra, viz. accordance with the promissory statements and\nthe illustrative examples. If there were admitted a guiding principle\ndifferent from the material cause, it would follow that everything cannot be\nknown through one thing, and thereby the promissory statements as well as the\nillustrative instances would be stultified.--The Self is thus the operative\ncause, because there is no other ruling principle, and the material cause\nbecause there is no other substance from which the world could originate.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[284:1](sbe34134.htm#fr_255) I.e. that the operative cause and the substantial\ncause are separate things.\n\n[284:2](sbe34134.htm#fr_256) Viz. the Sa _n_ khya-sm _ri_ ti.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 24](sbe34135.htm)\n\n"
