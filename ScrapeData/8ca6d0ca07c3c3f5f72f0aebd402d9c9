Now, therefore, we will describe three K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ras (or difficult\npenances). 1\n\n2\\. (During three days) he shall eat at the morning-meal food fit for\nofferings, and fast in the evening. 2\n\n3\\. Next, he shall eat (food fit for offerings), during. another period of\nthree days, in the evening (only). 3\n\n4\\. Next, during another period of three days, he shall not ask anybody (for\nfood).\n\n5\\. Next, he shall fast during another period of three days.\n\n6\\. He who desires (to be purified) quickly, shall stand during the day, and\nsit during the night. 6\n\np. 297\n\n7\\. He shall speak the truth. 7\n\n8\\. He shall not converse with anybody but \xc3\x82ryans.\n\n9\\. He shall daily sing the two (Samans called) Raurava and Yaudha _g_ aya.\n\n10\\. He shall bathe in the morning, at noon, and in the evening reciting, the\nthree (verses which begin) 'For ye waters are,' and he shall dry himself\nreciting the eight purificatory (verses which begin) 'The golden-coloured.'\n\n11\\. Next (he shall offer) libations of water.\n\n12\\. Adoration to him who creates self-consciousness, who creates matter, who\ngives gifts, who destroys (sin), who performs penance, to Punarvasu,\nadoration. 12\n\nAdoration to him who is worthy of (offerings)\n\np. 298\n\nconsisting of Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass, who is worth), of (offerings of) water, who\nconquers wealth, to him who conquers the universe, adoration.\n\nAdoration to him who gives success, who gives full success, who gives great\nsuccess, to him who carries (all undertakings) to a successful issue,\nadoration.\n\nAdoration to Rudra, the lord of cattle, the great god, the triocular,\nsolitary, supreme lord Hari, to dread _S_ arva, to \xc3\x8e _s_ ana who carries the\nthunderbolt, to the fierce wearer of matted locks, adoration.\n\nAdoration to the Sun, to Aditi's offspring, adoration.\n\nAdoration to him. whose neck is blue, to him whose throat is dark-blue,\nadoration.\n\nAdoration to the black one, to the brown one, adoration.\n\nAdoration to Indra, the first-born, the best, the ancient, to chaste Harike\n_s_ a, adoration.\n\nAdoration to the truthful purifier, to fire-coloured Kama, who changes his\nform at pleasure, adoration.\n\nAdoration to the brilliant one, to him whose form is brilliant, adoration.\n\nAdoration to the fierce one, to him whose form is fierce, adoration.\n\nAdoration to Sobhya, the beautiful, the great male, the middle male, the\nhighest male, to the student of the Veda, adoration.\n\nAdoration to him who wears the moon on his forehead, to him whose garment is a\nskin, adoration.\n\n13\\. The worship of \xc3\x82ditya (the sun) must be performed with the same (texts).\n13\n\np. 299\n\n14\\. Offerings of clarified butter (must be made with the help of) the same\n(texts).\n\n15\\. At the end of the period of twelve days he shall boil rice and. make\nofferings to the following deities,\n\n16\\. (Viz.) to Agni svaha, to Soma svaha, to Agni and Soma (conjointly), to\nIndra and Agni (conjointly), to Indra, to all the gods, to Brahman, to Pra _g_\napati, (and) to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n17\\. Afterwards (he must feed) Brahma _n_ as.\n\n18\\. By the above (rules) the Ati _k_ r.ik _kh_ ra (or exceedingly difficult)\npenance has been explained. 18\n\n19\\. (But when he performs that), he shall eat (only) as much as he can take\nat one (mouthful). 19\n\n20\\. The third (K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra) is that where water is the (only) food,\nand it is called K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ratik _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra (or the most difficult\npenance). 20\n\n21\\. He who has performed the first of these (three) becomes pure, sanctified,\nand worthy (to follow) the occupations (of his caste). 21\n\n22\\. He who has performed the second is freed from all sins which he commits,\nexcepting mortal sins (mahapataka).\n\n23\\. He who has performed the third, removes all guilt.\n\n24\\. Now he who performs these three K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ras becomes perfect in\nall the Vedas, and known to all the gods; 24\n\n25\\. Likewise he who knows this.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[296:1](sbe0290.htm#fr_1459) **XXVI**. Samavidhana I, 2, 1; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9,\n27, 7. Haradatta states that ata _h_ , 'therefore,' means 'because the K _ri_\n_k_ _kh_ ras cannot be performed if they have not been described,' while Saya\n_n_ a, on the Samavidhana, asserts that it means 'because unpurified persons\nwho are unable to offer sacrifices cannot gain heavenly bliss without\nperforming austerities such as K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ras.' It is a remarkable fact\nthat Haradatta does not seem to have been aware that the twenty-sixth chapter\nof Gautama is taken bodily from the Samavidhana.\n\n[296:2](sbe0290.htm#fr_1460) Samavidhana I, 2, 2. 'Food fit for offerings,\ni.e. such as is not mixed with salt or pungent condiments.'\n\n[296:3](sbe0290.htm#fr_1461)-5. Samavidhana, I, 2, 3.\n\n[296:6](sbe0290.htm#fr_1462) Samavidhana I, 2-4.\n\n[297:7](sbe0290.htm#fr_1463)-11. Samavidhana I, 2, 5. \xc3\x82ryans, i.e. Brahma _n_\nas, Kshatriyas, and Vai _s_ yas. Regarding the Samans and Mantras, see notes\nto Burnell's edition of the Samavidhana, and above, XXV, 7. Haradatta remarks\nthat in the Taitt. Sa _m_ h. (V, 6, 1) the Mantras beginning ' The golden-\ncoloured' are ten in number, and adds that 'if in some other _S_ akha eight\nare found, those must be taken.'\n\n[297:12](sbe0290.htm#fr_1464) Samavidhana I, 2, 5, where, however, only four\nMantras are given instead of our thirteen. The epithets given to the deity in\nthe Samavidhana can all be referred to the Sun, provided he is identified with\nthe universal soul, while in the above Sutra, Rudra and Indra have been\nintroduced. It cannot be doubtful that the Samavidhana gives an older and more\nauthentic form of the prayer. My translation of the epithets, which are found\nin the Samavidhana also, follows Saya _n_ a's gloss. Haradatta does not\nexplain them. About Sobhya in the twelfth Mantra, which possibly might mean,\n'he who dwells in a mirage, i.e. the Sa _m_ sara,' I feel doubtful. My MSS.\nread somya, and the Samavidhana has saumya in the second Mantra. But I am\nunwilling to alter the word, as Professor Stenzler's reading may have been\nderived from a South-Indian MS., where bhya and mya do not resemble each other\nso, much as in the Devanagari characters.\n\n[298:13](sbe0290.htm#fr_1465)-17.

Sarveshu vedeshu snata\n_h_ , 'perfect p. 300 in all the Vedas,' means, literally, equal to a student\nwho has bathed after completing the study of all the four Vedas.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXVII](sbe0291.htm)\n\n"
