Where did your love have its\nrise?"  \nKabir answers:  \n"When He whose forms are manifold had not begun His play: when there was no\nGuru, and no disciple: when the world was not spread out: when the Supreme One\nwas alone--  \nThen I became an ascetic; then, O Gorakh, my love was drawn to Brahma.  \nBrahma did not hold the crown on his head; the god Vishnu was not p. 78\nanointed as king; the power of Shiva was still unborn; when I was instructed\nin Yoga.\n\nI became suddenly revealed in Benares, and Ramananda illumined me;  \nI brought with me the thirst for the Infinite, and I have come for the meeting\nwith Him.  \nIn simplicity will I unite with the Simple One; my love will surge up.  \nO Gorakh, march thou with His music!"\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXX](sok031.htm)\n\n'
