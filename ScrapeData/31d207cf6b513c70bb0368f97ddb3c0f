Also beings above them (i.e. men), Badaraya _n_ a thinks, on account of\npossibility.\n\nIn order to prove that the highest Brahman may be\n\np. 327\n\nviewed as having the size of a thumb, it has been declared that the scriptural\ntexts enjoining meditation on Brahman are the concern of men. This offers an\nopportunity for the discussion of the question whether also other classes of\nindividual souls, such as devas, are qualified for knowledge of Brahman. The\nPurvapakshin denies this qualification in the case of gods and other beings,\non the ground of absence of capability. For, he says, bodiless beings, such as\ngods, are incapable of the accomplishment of meditation on Brahman, which\nrequires as its auxiliaries the seven means enumerated above ([p.\n17](sbe48006.htm#page_17))--This must not be objected to on the ground of the\ndevas, and so on, having bodies; for there is no means of proof establishing\nsuch embodiedness. We have indeed proved above that the Vedanta-texts may\nintimate accomplished things, and hence are an authoritative means for the\ncognition of Brahman; but we do not meet with any Vedanta-text, the purport of\nwhich is to teach that the devas, and so on, possess bodies. Nor can this\npoint be established through mantras and arthavada texts; for these are merely\nsupplementary to the injunctions of actions (sacrificial, and so on), and\ntherefore have a different aim. And the injunctions themselves prove nothing\nwith regard to the devas, except that the latter are that with a view to which\nthose actions are performed. In the same way it also cannot be shown that the\ngods have any desires or wants (to fulfil or supply which they might enter on\nmeditation of Brahman). For the two reasons above we therefore conclude that\nthe devas, and so on, are not qualified for meditation on Brahman.--This view\nis contradicted by the Sutra. Such meditation is possible in the case of\nhigher beings also Badaraya _n_ a thinks; on account of the possibility of\nwant and capacity on their part also. Want and wish exist in their case since\nthey also are liable to suffering, springing from the assaults, hard to be\nendured, of the different kinds of pain, and since they also know that supreme\nenjoyment is to be found in the highest Brahman, which is untouched by the\nshadow even of imperfection, and is a mass of auspicious qualities in their\nhighest perfection.\n\np. 328\n\n[paragraph continues] 'Capability', on the other hand, depends on the\npossession of a body and sense-organs of whatever degree of tenuity; and that\nthe devas, from Brahma downward, possess a body and sense-organs, is declared\nin all the Upanishads, in the chapters treating of creation and the chapters\nenjoining meditation. In the _Kh_ andogya, e.g. it is related how the highest\nBeing having resolved on creation, evolved the aggregate of non-sentient\nmatter with its different kinds, and then produced the fourfold multitude of\nliving creatures, each having a material body corresponding to its karman, and\na suitable name of its own. Similarly, all the other scriptural accounts of\ncreation declare that there are four classes of creatures--devas, men,\nanimals, and non-moving beings, such as plants--and the difference of these\nclasses depends on the individual Selfs being joined to various bodies\ncapacitating them to experience the results of their works, each in that one\nof the fourteen worlds--beginning with the world of Brahma\\--which is the\nsuitable place for retribution. For in themselves, apart from bodies, the\nindividual Selfs are not distinguished as men, gods, and so on. In the same\nway the story of the devas and Asuras approaching Pra _g_ apati with fuel in\ntheir hands, staying with him as pupils for thirty-two years, &c. ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 7 ff.), clearly shows that the devas possess bodies and sense-organs.\nAnalogously, mantras and arthavadas, which are complementary to injunctions of\nworks, contain unmistakeable references to the corporeal nature of the gods\n('Indra holding in his hand the thunderbolt'; 'Indra lifted the thunderbolt',\n&c.); and as the latter is not contradicted by any other means of proof it\nmust be accepted on the authority stated. Nor can it be said that those\nmantras and arthavadas are really meant to express something else (than those\ndetails mentioned above), in so far, namely, as they aim at proclaiming or\nglorifying the action with which they are connected; for those very details\nsubserve the purpose of glorification, and so on, and without them\nglorification is not possible. For we praise or glorify a thing by declaring\nits qualities; if such qualities do not exist all glorification lapses. It\ncannot by any means be\n\np. 329\n\nmaintained that anything may be glorified by the proclamation of its\nqualities, even if such qualities do not really exist. Hence the arthavadas\nwhich glorify a certain action, just thereby intimate the real existence of\nthe qualities and details of the action. The mantras again, which are\nprescribed in connexion with the actions, serve the purpose of throwing light\non the use to be derived from the performance of the actions, and this they\naccomplish by making statements as to the particular qualities, such as\nembodiedness and the like, which belong to the devas and other classes of\nbeings. Otherwise Indra, and so on, would not be remembered at the time of\nperformance; for the idea of a divinity presents itself to the mind only in\nconnexion with the special attributes of that divinity. In the case of such\nqualities as are not established by other means of proof, the primary\nstatement is made by the arthavada or the mantra: the former thereby glorifies\nthe action, and the latter proclaims it as possessing certain qualities or\ndetails; and both these ends are accomplished by making statements as to the\ngods, &c., possessing certain qualities, such as embodiedness and the like. In\nthe case, again, of certain qualities being already established by other means\nof proof, the mantras and arthavadas merely refer to them (as something\nalready known), and in this way perform their function of glorification and\nelucidation. And where, thirdly, there is a contradiction between the other\nmeans of knowledge and what mantras and arthavadas state (as when, e.g. a text\nof the latter kind says that 'the sacrificial post is the sun'), the intention\nof the text is metaphorically to denote, by means of those apparently\nunmeaning terms, certain other qualities which are not excluded by the other\nmeans of knowledge; and in this way the function of glorification and\nelucidation is again accomplished. Now what the injunction of a sacrificial\naction demands as its supplement, is a statement as to the power of the\ndivinity to whom the sacrifice is offered; for the performance which scripture\nenjoins on men desirous of certain results, is itself of a merely transitory\nnature, and hence requires some agent capable of bringing about,\n\np. 330\n\nat some future time, the result desired as, e.g. the heavenly world. 'Vayu is\nthe swiftest god; he (the sacrificer) approaches Vayu with his own share; the\ngod then leads him to prosperity' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. I, 2, 1); 'What he seeks\nby means of that offering, may he obtain that, may he prosper therein, may the\ngods favourably grant him that' (Taitt. Br. III, 5, 10, 5); these and similar\narthavadas and mantras intimate that the gods when propitiated by certain\nsacrificial works, give certain rewards and possess the power to do so; and\nthey thus connect themselves with the general context of scripture as\nsupplying an evidently required item of information. Moreover, the mere verb\n'to sacrifice' (ya _g_ ), as denoting worship of the gods, intimates the\npresence of a deity which is to be propitiated by the action called sacrifice,\nand thus constitutes the main element of that action. A careful consideration\nof the whole context thus reveals that everything which is wanted for the due\naccomplishment of the action enjoined is to be learned from the text itself,\nand that hence we need not have recourse to such entities as the 'unseen\nprinciple' (apurva), assumed to be denoted by, or to be imagined in connexion\nwith, the passages enjoining certain actions. Hence the dharma _s_ astras,\nitihasas, and pura _n_ as also, which are founded on the different brahma _n_\nas, mantras and arthavadas, clearly teach that Brahma and the other gods, as\nwell as the Asuras and other superhuman beings, have bodies and sense-organs,\nconstitutions of different kinds, different abodes, enjoyments, and functions.\n--Owing to their having bodies, the gods therefore are also qualified for\nmeditation on Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[326:1](sbe48123.htm#fr_30) The 'pramitadhikara _n_ a' is resumed in Sutra 41.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 26.
