Charm for driving away demons (Rakshas and Pisakas).\n\n1\\. Do ye well offer within the fire this oblation with ghee, that destroys\nthe spook! Do thou, O Agni, burn from afar against the Rakshas, (but) our\nhouses thou shalt not consume!  \n2\\. Rudra has broken your necks, ye Pisakas: may he also break your ribs, ye\nspooks! The plant whose power is everywhere has united you with Yama (death).  \n3\\. Exempt from danger, O Mitra and Varuna, may we here be; drive back with\nyour flames the devouring demons (Atrin)! Neither aider, nor support do they\nfind; smiting one another they go to death.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4.
