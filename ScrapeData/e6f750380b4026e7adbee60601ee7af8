He then lays down a Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a 2 (space-filling brick); the\nLokamp _ri_ _n_ a, doubtless, is yonder\n\np. 132\n\nsun, for he fills these worlds: it is thus yonder sun he thereby sets up. He\nlays down this (Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a) in all the (five) layers, for those layers\nare these (three) worlds 1: he thus places the sun in (all) these worlds,\nwhence he shines for all these worlds.\n\n8:7:2:22\\. And, again, as to why he lays down a Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a,--the Lokamp\n_ri_ _n_ a, doubtless, is the nobility (or chieftaincy) 2, and these other\nbricks are the peasants (or clansmen): he thus places the nobility (or\nchieftain), as the eater, among the peasantry. He lays it down in all the\nlayers: he thus places the nobility, as the eater, among the whole peasantry\n(or in every clan).\n\n8:7:2:33\\. Now this is only a single (brick): he thus makes the nobility (or\nthe chieftaincy) and (social) distinction to attach to a single (person). And\nwhat second (such brick there is) that is its mate,--a mate, doubtless, is one\nhalf of one's own self, for when one is with a mate then he is whole and\ncomplete: (thus it is laid down) for the sake of completeness. With a single\nformula he lays down many bricks 3: he thereby endows the nobility\npreeminently\n\np. 133\n\nwith power 1, and makes the nobility more powerful than the peasantry. And the\nother (bricks) he lays down singly, with separate formulas: he thereby makes\nthe peasantry less powerful than the nobility, differing in speech, and of\ndifferent thoughts (from one another).\n\n8:7:2:44\\. The first two (Lokamp _ri_ _n_ as) he lays down in that (south-\neast) corner: he thereby places yonder sun in that quarter: from this (earth)\nhe follows him (the sun) from that (place) there 2; from this (earth) he\nfollows him from that (place) there; from this (earth) he follows hire from\nthat (place) there; from this (earth) he follows him from that (place) there.\n\n8:7:2:55\\. And in whatever place he lays down the first two (bricks), let him\nthere lay down alongside of\n\np. 134\n\nthem the last two (bricks): for (otherwise) having once revolved round these\nworlds, that sun would not pass by them. Let him lay down the two last\nalongside the two first by reaching over them: he thus causes that sun to pass\nby these worlds; and hence that sun revolves incessantly round these worlds\nagain and again (from left) to right.\n\n8:7:2:66\\. [He lays them down, with, Va _g_. S. XV, 59], 'Fill the space! fill\nthe gap!'--that is, 'fill up the space! fill up the gap;'--'and lie thou\nsteady!'--that is, 'and lie thou firm, settled!'--'Indra and Agni, and B _ri_\nhaspati, have settled thee in this womb;' that is, 'Indra and Agni, and B _ri_\nhaspati, have established thee in this womb.' Thus (he establishes them) by an\nanush _t_ ubh verse; for the Anush _t_ ubh is speech, and Indra is speech, and\nthe space-filler is Indra. He does not settle them, for that (sun) is\nunsettled. He pronounces the Sudadohas on them, for the Sudadohas is vital\nair: he thus makes him (Agni) continuous and joins him together by means of\nthe vital air.\n\n8:7:2:77\\. Here now they say, 'How does that Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a become of\nunimpaired strength?' Well, the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a is yonder sun, and he\nassuredly is of unimpaired strength. And the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a also is speech,\nand of unimpaired strength assuredly is speech.\n\n8:7:2:88\\. Having laid down those (bricks) possessed of (special) sacrificial\nformulas, he covers (the altar) with the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a; for the bricks\npossessed of formulas mean food, and the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a means the body: he\nthus encloses the food in the body, whence food enclosed in the body is the\nbody itself.\n\np. 135\n\n8:7:2:99\\. Those (bricks) possessed of formulas he places on the body (of the\naltar) itself, not on the wings and tail: he thus puts food into the body; and\nwhatever food is put into the body that benefits both the body and the wings\nand tail; but that which he puts on the wings and tail benefits neither the\nbody, nor the wings and tail.\n\n8:7:2:1010\\. On the body (of the altar) he places both (bricks) possessed of\nformulas and Lokamp _ri_ _n_ as; whence that body (of a bird) is, as it were,\ntwice as thick. On the wings and tail (he places) only Lokamp _ri_ _n_ as,\nwhence the wings and tail are, as it were, thinner. On the body (of the altar)\nhe places them both lengthwise and crosswise, for the bricks are bones: hence\nthese bones in the body run both lengthwise and crosswise. On the wings and\ntail (he places them so as to be) turned away (from the body), for in the\nwings and tail there is not a single transverse bone. And this, indeed, is the\ndifference between a built and an unbuilt (altar): suchlike is the built one,\ndifferent therefrom the unbuilt one 1.\n\n8:7:2:1111\\. The Svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a (naturally-perforated brick) he\nencloses with Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a (bricks); for the naturally-perforated one is\nthe breath, and the 'space-filler' is the sun: he thus kindles the breath by\nmeans of the sun, whence this breath (of ours) is warm. With that (kind of\nbrick) he fills up the whole body: he thereby kindles the whole body by means\nof the sun, whence this whole body (of ours) is warm. And this, indeed, is the\ndifference between one that will live and one that will die:\n\np. 136\n\nhe that will live is warm, and he that will die is cold.\n\n8:7:2:1212\\. From the corner in which he lays down the first two (Lokamp _ri_\n_n_ as) he goes on filling up (the altar) by tens up to the Svayamat _ri_ _n_\n_n_ a. In the same way he goes on filling it up from left to right behind the\nnaturally-perforated one up to (the brick on) the cross-spine 1. He then fills\nit up whilst returning to that limit 2.\n\n8:7:2:1313\\. The body (of the altar) he fills up first, for of (a bird) that\nis produced, the body is produced first, then the right wing, then the tail,\nthen the left (wing): that is in the rightward (sunwise) way, for this is (the\nway) with the gods, and thus, indeed, yonder sun moves along these worlds from\nleft to right.\n\n8:7:2:1414\\. The Lokamp _ri_ _n_ a, doubtless, is the same as the vital air;\nhe therewith fills up the whole body (of the altar): he thus puts vital air\ninto the whole body. If he were not to reach any member thereof, then the\nvital air would not reach that member of him (Agni); and whatever member the\nvital air does not reach, that, assuredly, either dries up or withers away:\nlet him therefore fill up therewith the whole of it.\n\n8:7:2:1515\\. The wings and tail he builds on to the body, for the wings and\ntail grow on to the body; but were he first to lay down those (bricks) turned\naway (from the body), it would be as if he were to take a limb from elsewhere\nand put it on again.\n\np. 137\n\n8:7:2:1616\\. Let him not lay down either a broken (brick) or a black one; for\none that is broken causes failure, and sickly is that form which is black:\n'Lest I should make up a sickly body,' he thinks 1. Let him not throw aside an\nunbroken (brick), lest he should put what is not sickly outside the body.\nWhatever (bricks), in counting from the dhish _n_ ya hearths, should exceed a\nVira _g_  2, and not make up another, such (bricks) indeed cause failure: let\nhim break them and throw them 3 (ut-kir) on the heap of rubbish (utkara), for\nthe heap of rubbish is the seat of what is redundant: thus he thereby settles\nthem where there is. the seat of that which is redundant.\n\n8:7:2:1717\\. Now, then, of the measures of the bricks. In the first and last\nlayers let him lay down (bricks) of a foot (square), for the foot is a\nsupport; and the hand is the same as the foot. The largest (bricks) should be\nof the measure of the thigh-bone, for there is no bone larger than the thigh-\nbone. Three layers should have (their bricks) marked with three lines, for\nthreefold are these worlds; and two (layers\n\np. 138\n\nmay consist) of (bricks) marked with an indefinite number of lines, for these\ntwo layers are the flavour, and the flavour is indefinite; but all (the\nlayers) should rather have (bricks) marked with three lines, for threefold are\nall these worlds.\n\n8:7:2:1818\\. Now, then, of the location 1 of (special) bricks. Any (special)\nbrick he knows, provided with a formula, let him place in the middle (third)\nlayer; for the middle layer is the air, and the air, doubtless, is the\nlocation of all beings. Moreover, bricks with (special) formulas are food, and\nthe middle layer is the belly: he thus puts food into the belly.\n\n8:7:2:1919\\. Here, now, they say, 'Let him not lay down (such special bricks)\nlest he should do what is excessive.' But he may, nevertheless, lay them down;\nfor such bricks are laid down for (the fulfilment of special) wishes, and in\nwishes there is nothing excessive. But let him rather not lay them down, for\njust that much the gods then did.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[131:2](sbe4327.htm#fr_234) In laying down the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ as of the fifth\nlayer, he begins, as in the first layer, from the right shoulder, or the\nsouth-east corner, of the altar, but so that in this case the first 'space-\nfiller' is laid down, not at the corner, but a cubit to the west of it.\nStarting from that spot, he fills up the available spaces, in two turns,\nmoving in the sunwise fashion.\n\n[132:1](sbe4327.htm#fr_235) Rather, the first, second, and third layers are\nthe three worlds.\n\n[132:2](sbe4327.htm#fr_236) At VI, 1, 2, 25 Ta _n_ _d_ ya was made to maintain\nthat the Ya _g_ ushmatis, or bricks laid down with special formulas, were the\nnobility, and that the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ as, laid down with one and the same\nformula, were the peasants, and as the noble (or chieftain) required a\nnumerous clan for his subsistence, there should be fewer of the former kind of\nbricks, than the established practice was. This view was however rejected by\nthe author of the Brahma _n_ a, and here, in opposition to that view, the\nLokamp _ri_ _n_ a is identified with the nobility, and the Ya _g_ ushmatis\nwith the clan.\n\n[132:3](sbe4327.htm#fr_237) The common formula used with these bricks, and\nfrom which they derive their name--beginning as it does 'Lokam p _ri_ _n_ a,'\n'Fill the space!' see [parag. 6](sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:6)\\--is pronounced once\nonly after every ten such bricks, and after any odd ones at the end.\n\n[133:1](sbe4327.htm#fr_238) In the translation of VII, 5, 2, 14 (part iii, p.\n404), the passage 'having taken possession of the man by strength,' which was\nbased on a wrong reading (see Weber, Berl. Cat. II, p. 69), should read thus:\n'having pre-eminently endowed man with power' (or, perhaps, 'having placed him\nabove (others) in respect of power,' St. Petersb. Dict.)\n\n[133:2](sbe4327.htm#fr_239) I do not know whether 'atas' might be taken here\nin the sense of 'thither,' or whether it goes along with 'tasmat,' merely\nstrengthening it. The meaning in either case would seem to be this. In the\nfirst turn of filling up the empty spaces he first moves along from the south-\neast corner (the point where the sun rises) to the back or west end of the\nspine (the place where the sun sets) and the central brick; and having thus,\nas it were, touched the earth again, he proceeds from there in the same\nsunwise fashion, filling up the north part of the altar until he reaches the\neast end of the spine, and there, as it were, touches the earth once more. In\nthe second turn he again begins (with the second brick) in the south-east, and\nrepeats the same process, in filling up the south part of the altar, and\ncompleting at the southeast corner. The laying down of the Lokamp _ri_ _n_ as\nwould thus be supposed to occupy the full space of two days and two nights.\n\n[135:1](sbe4327.htm#fr_240) That is, one not properly built.\n\n[136:1](sbe4327.htm#fr_241) This would seem to be the Vikar _n_ i (see [VIII,\n7, 3, 9](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:9) seqq.) which, however, like the central Svayamat\n_ri_ _n_ _n_ a, is only to be laid down after the layer has been levelled up.\n\n[136:2](sbe4327.htm#fr_242) Viz. to the east end of the 'spine.'\n\n[137:1](sbe4327.htm#fr_243) Here, as so often before, the effect to be avoided\nis expressed by a clause in _oratio directa_ with 'ned'; the inserted clause\nwith 'vai' indicating the reason why that effect is to be dreaded. To adapt\nthe passage to our own mode of diction, we should have to translate:--Let him\nnot lay down either a broken brick or a black one, lest he should form a\nsickly body; for a brick which is broken comes to grief, and what is black is\nof sickly appearance.--In the next sentence of the translation, the direct\nform of speech has been discarded.\n\n[137:2](sbe4327.htm#fr_244) The pada of the Vira _g_ consists of ten, and a\nwhole Vira _g_ stanza of thirty (or forty), syllables. Hence the number of the\nbricks is to be divisible by ten.\n\n[137:3](sbe4327.htm#fr_245) Or, perhaps, dig them in.\n\n[138:1](sbe4327.htm#fr_246) \xc3\x82vapana has also the meaning of 'throwing in,\ninsertion,' which is likewise understood here, whilst further on in this\nparagraph ('the air is the avapanam of all beings') it can scarcely have this\nmeaning (? something injected). Cf. [IX, 4, 2, 27](sbe4340.htm#9:4:2:27).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 7, 3. Third Brahma _n_ a](sbe4328.htm)\n\n"
