Shame  \nOn that malicious sinful dame,  \nWho, keenly bent on cruel deeds,  \nNo hounds of righht and virtue heeds,  \nBut with her wicked art has sent  \nSo good a prince to banishment,  \nWi-o, tender-hearted, ruling well  \nHis senses in the woods to dwell.  \nAh cruel king! his heart of steel  \nFor his own son no love could feel,  \n\nWho with the sinless Rama parts,  \nThe darling of the people's hearts.'  \n\n   These words he heard the peasants say,  \nWho dwelt in hamlets by the way,  \nAnd, lord of all the realm by right,  \nThrough Kosala pursued his flight.  \nThrough the auspicious flood, at last,  \nOf Vesasruti's stream he passed,  \nAud onward to the place he sped  \nBy Saint Agastya tenanted.  \nStill on for many an hour he hied,  \nAnd crossed the stream whose fooling tide  \nRolls onward till she meets the sea,  \nThe herd-frequented Gomatil  \nBorne by his rapid horses o'er,  \nHe reached that river's further shore.  \nAnd Syandika's,whose svan-loved stream,  \nResounded with the peacock's scream.  \nThen as he journeyed on his road  \nTo hvs Videhan bride he showed  \nThe populous land which Manu old  \nTo King IKshvaku gave to hold.  \nThe glorious prince, the lord of men  \nLooked on the charioteer, and then  \nVoiced like a wild swan, loud and clear.  \nHe spake these words and bade him hear:  \n'When shall I, with returning feet  \nMy father and my mother meet?  \nWhen shall I lead the hunt once more  \nIn bloomy woods on Sarju's shore?  \nMost eagerly I long to ride  \nUrging the chase on Sarju's side.  \nFor royal saints have seen no blame  \nIn this, the monarch's matchless game.'  \n\nThus speeding on,--no reft or stay,--  \nIkshvaku's son pursued his way.  \nOft his sweet voice the silence broke,  \nAnd thus on varied themes he spoke.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto L.: The Halt Under The Ingudi.](ry128.htm)\n\n"
