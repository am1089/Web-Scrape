I will never come to you when you call me, and never let\nyou feed me any more.\n\nIf I were only a little green parrot, and not your baby, mother dear, would\nyou keep me chained lest I should fly away?\n\nWould you shake your finger at me and say, "What an ungrateful wretch of a\nbird! It is gnawing at its chain day and night?"\n\nThen, go, mother, go! I will run away into the woods; I will never let you\ntake me in your arms again.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Vocation](cm27.htm)\n\n'
