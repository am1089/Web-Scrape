The body is composed of the five (elements); it exists in the five\n(objects of sense, etc.); it has six supports: it is associated with the six\ngu\xe1\xb9\x87as; it has seven \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadus (essential ingredients) and three malas\n(impurities); it has three yonis (wombs) and is formed of four kinds of food.\n\nWhy is the body said to be composed of five? Because there are five elements\nin this body ( _viz_.), p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab, \xc4\x81pas, agni, v\xc4\x81yu, and \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. In this body of\nfive elements, what is the p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab element? what \xc4\x81pas? what agni? what v\xc4\x81yu?\nand what \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b? P\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab is said to be that which is hard; \xc4\x81pas is said to be\nthat which is liquid; agni is said to be that which is hot; v\xc4\x81yu is that,\nwhich moves; \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b is that which is full of holes (or tubes 2). Of these,\np\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab is seen in supporting (objects), \xc4\x81pas in cohesion, \xe1\xb9\xadejas (or agni) in\nmaking forms visible, v\xc4\x81yu in moving, \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b chiefly in avak\xc4\x81\xc5\x9ba ( _viz_., giving\nspace). (Then what are the five objects of sense, etc.?) The ear exists in\nsound, the skin in touch, the eye in forms, the tongue in taste, and the nose\nin odour. (Then) the mouth (exists) in speech, the hand in lifting, the feet\nin walking, the anus in excreting, and the genitals in enjoying. (Then)\nthrough bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, one knows and determines; through manas, he thinks and\nfancies; through chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, he recollects; through aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra, he feels the idea of\n\'I\'. Thus these perform their respective functions.\n\np. 117\n\nWhence the six supports? There are six kinds of rasas (essences or\ntastes)--sweet, sour, saltish, bitter, astringent, and pungent. The body\ndepends upon them while they depend upon the body. There are six changes of\nstate ( _viz_.), the body exists, is born, grows, matures, decays, and dies.\nAnd there are also six chakras (wheels) depending on the \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81ni (nerves), (\n_viz_.), m\xc5\xabl\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra, sv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhishth\xc4\x81na, ma\xe1\xb9\x87ip\xc5\xabraka, an\xc4\x81ha\xe1\xb9\xada, vi\xc5\x9bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, and \xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81.\nAlso the gu\xe1\xb9\x87as are six--k\xc4\x81ma (passion) and others and \xc5\x9bama (mental restraint)\nand others; there being properly--association (with the former) and devotion\n(to the latter). Then there are seven kinds of sounds, ( _viz_.), shadja (sa),\n\xe1\xb9\x9bshabha (ri), g\xc4\x81n\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81ra (ga), ma\xe1\xb8\x8dhyama (ma), pa\xc3\xb1chama (pa), \xe1\xb8\x8daiva\xe1\xb9\xada (da), and\nnish\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da (ni), which are stated to be seven agreeable and disagreeable ones;\nand there are seven kinds of \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadus having seven colours, ( _viz_.), \xc5\x9bukla\n(white), rak\xe1\xb9\xada (red), k\xe1\xb9\x9bsh\xe1\xb9\x87a (dark-blue or indigo), \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc5\xabmra (blue), p\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada\n(yellow), kapila (orange-red), and p\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87dara (yellowish white). In whomsoever\nthese substances arise and increase, the rasa (essence) is the cause of the\none following and so on (as stated below). (These) rasas are six in number;\nfrom the rasas (probably chyme) arises blood: from blood, flesh; from flesh,\nfat; from fat, bones; from bones, marrow; and from marrow, \xc5\x9bukla (the male\nseminal fluid). From the union of \xc5\x9bukla and \xc5\x9bo\xe1\xb9\x87i\xe1\xb9\xada (the female vital energy),\noccurs garbha (conception in the womb). Being stationed in the heart, it is\nled. In the heart of persons, (there is) an internal agni; in the seat of\nagni, there is bile; in the seat of bile, there is v\xc4\x81yu; in the seat of v\xc4\x81yu,\nis h\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb8\x8dya (heart or \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81).\n\nThrough having connection at the \xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadu (season) fit for raising issues, it (the\nembryo formed in the womb) is like water in the first night; in seven nights,\nit is like a bubble; at the end of half a month, it becomes a ball. At the end\nof a month, it is hardened; in two months, the head is formed; in three\nmonths, the region about the feet; and in the fourth month, the region about\nthe stomach and the loins and also ankle is formed; in the fifth month, the\nback (or spinal) bone; in the sixth, the face of the nose, eyes, and ears; in\nthe seventh, it becomes united with J\xc4\xabva (\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81); in the eighth month, it\nbecomes full (of all organs); in the\n\np. 118\n\nninth, it becomes fatty. \xc5\x9aukla belongs to men and \xc5\x9bo\xe1\xb9\x87i\xe1\xb9\xada to women. Each (by\nitself) is neutral (or is powerless). (But in their combination) a son is born\nwhen the father\'s seed preponderates. A daughter is born when the mother\'s\nseed preponderates. Should both be equal, a eunuch is born. Since females have\nmore of passion, on account of their deriving more pleasure (than males from\nsexual union), a greater number of females are born. Action corresponds to the\nmental state (of the actor). Hence the child (born) takes after (the thought\nof) the parents. From parents with minds full of anxieties (at the time of\nunion) are born the blind, the lame, the hunchback, the dwarf, and the\nlimbless. (From impregnation) during the eclipses of the sun and the moon,\nchildren are born with defective limbs. Increase or decrease, similarities or\ndissimilarities of bodies arise (in children) through the influence of time,\nplace, action, \xe1\xb8\x8dravya (substance), and enjoyment. From a well-conducted\nintercourse (or union), the child being born with the form of the father\npossesses, his qualities, just as the image in a glass reflects truly the\noriginal. When \xc5\x9bukla bursts into two through the interaction (or blowing\nagainst one another) of the v\xc4\x81yu of both \xc5\x9bukla and \xc5\x9bo\xe1\xb9\x87i\xe1\xb9\xada, then twins (of the\nsame sex) are born. In the same manner when the re\xe1\xb9\xadas (the seminal fluids),\n_viz_., (\xc5\x9bukla and \xc5\x9bo\xe1\xb9\x87i\xe1\xb9\xada) of both the parents burst into two, then mixed\nprogeny (male and female) is the result. Among mankind, five embryos (only can\nbe formed at a pregnancy in the womb). A womb with one embryo is common. There\nare some with two. Those with three are only to be found (as rarely) as one in\na thousand. Where there is a frequent pouring (of seminal fluid into the\nwomb), a greater number of limbs is produced (in the child). When the pouring\n(within the womb) is only once, then the child becomes dried up (or\ncontracted). By pouring (within) more than once, couples are (sometimes) born.\n\nThen, ( _viz_., in the ninth month), this (in the body) made of the five\nelements and able to sense odour, taste, etc., through \xe1\xb9\xadejas (spiritual fire),\netc., which is also made up of the five elements--this cognizes the\nindestructible Omk\xc4\x81ra through its deep wisdom and contemplation. It cognizes\nas the one letter\n\np. 119\n\n[paragraph continues] (Om). Then there arise in the body the eight prak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadis 1\nand the sixteen vik\xc4\x81ras (changes). Through the food and drink of the mother\ntransmitted through her n\xc4\x81dis, the child obtains pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a. In the ninth month, it\nis full of all attributes.\n\nIt then remembers its previous births, finds out what has been done and what\nhas not been done, and discriminates between actions, right and wrong. (Then\nit thinks thus:) Many thousands of wombs have been seen by me, many kinds of\nfood have been tasted (by me), and many breasts have been suckled (by me). All\nparts of the world have been my place of birth, as also my burning-ground in\nthe past. In eighty-four lakhs 2 of wombs, have I been born. I have been often\nborn and have often died. I have been subject to the cycle of rebirths very\noften. I have had birth and death, again birth and death, and again birth (and\nso on). There is much suffering whilst living in the womb. Delusion and sorrow\nattend every birth. In youth are sorrow, grief, dependence on others,\nignorance, the non-performance of what is beneficial) laziness, and the\nperformance of what is unfavourable. In adult age, (the sources of sorrow are)\nattachment to sensual objects and the groaning under the three kinds 3 of\npain. In old age anxiety, disease, fear of death, desires, love of self,\npassion, anger, and non-independence--all these produce very great suffering.\nThis birth is the seed of sorrow, and being of the form of sorrow is\nunbearable. I have not attained the \xe1\xb8\x8dharma of niv\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadi, ( _viz_., the means of\novercoming the cycle of re-birth) nor have I acquired the means of yoga and\nj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na. Alas! I am sunk in the ocean of sorrow and find no remedy for it. Fie\non aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na! fie on aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na! fie on the troubles caused by passion and anger; fie\non the fetters of sams\xc4\x81ra (the mundane existence)! I shall attain wisdom from\na guru. If I get myself freed from the womb, then I shall practise s\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x85khya\nyoga which is the cause of the extinction of all evil and the bestower\n\np. 120\n\nof the fruit of emancipation. If I get myself freed from the womb, I shall\nseek refuge in Mahe\xc5\x9bvara (the great Lord) who is the cause of the extinction\nof all evil and bestower of the (four 1) ends of life. If I get myself freed\nfrom the womb, then I shall seek refuge in that Lord of the world who is the\nChi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 of all \xc5\x9bak\xe1\xb9\xadis and the cause of all causes. If I get myself freed from\nthe womb, then I shall seek refuge in that supreme Lord Bharga\xe1\xb8\xa5 (\xc5\x9aiva or\nlight) who is pa\xc5\x9bupa\xe1\xb9\xadi (the lord of pa\xc5\x9bus or souls), Ru\xe1\xb8\x8dra, Mah\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8deva (the\ngreat Deva) and the Guru of the world. If I get myself freed from the bondage\nof the womb, I shall perform great penances. If I get myself freed from the\npassage of the womb, I shall worship Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u in my heart who is the bestower of\nnectar, who is bliss, who is N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, and who never decays. I am now confined\nin my mother\'s womb; and were I freed from its bonds, I shall please the\ndivine V\xc4\x81su\xe1\xb8\x8deva without diverting my mind from Him. I am burnt through\nactions, good and bad, committed by me alone before for the sake of others,\nwhilst those who enjoyed the fruits thereof have disappeared. Through non-\nbelief (unspirituality), I formerly gave up all fear (of sin) and committed\nsins. I now reap their fruits. I shall become a believer hereafter 2."\n\nThus does the J\xc4\xabva (\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) within the (mother\'s womb) contemplate again and\nagain the many kinds of miseries (it had undergone), and remembering always\nthe miseries of the cycle of re-births, becomes disgusted (with the material\nenjoyments of the world), often fainting in the inmost centre ( _viz_., heart)\nof all creatures at (the idea of) his avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81, desire, and karma. Then this\nbeing, who had entered many hundreds of female wombs of beings (in the\nprevious births), comes to the mouth of the womb wishing to obtain release.\nHere being pressed by the yan\xe1\xb9\xadra (neck of the uterus), it suffers much\ntrouble. Moreover it is much affected by pras\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadi (delivery) v\xc4\x81yu. As soon as\nit is born, it comes in contact with the vaish\xe1\xb9\x87av\xc4\xab v\xc4\x81yu and ceases to remember\nanything of the past;\n\np. 121\n\nit also ceases to see far and to be the cognizer of the real. Coming into\ncontact with the earth, it becomes fierce-eyed and debased. The evil of the\neye after it is rubbed with (or cleaned by) water vanishes; and with it,\nvanishes memory of birth and death, good and bad actions and their affinities.\nThen how does he understand v\xc4\x81yu, bile, and \xc5\x9bleshma (phlegm)? When they are in\ntheir proper state, they produce health: with their disturbance, diseases are\ngenerated. It should be known that one becomes capable of knowing through a\nproper quantity of bile; through having a little more or a little less of it,\nhe comes to know more. When the bile is changed (otherwise), he becomes\nchanged and acts like a mad man. And that bile is agni. Agni influenced by\nkarma is kindled by v\xc4\x81yu, the source (or seat) of virtue and vice, as fuel is\nkindled within (by fire) from without (by the wind).\n\nAnd of how many kinds is that agni? It has three bodies, three re\xe1\xb9\xadas (seeds or\nprogeny), three puras (cities), three \xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadus, and three kinds of agni\nthreefold. Of these three, Vai\xc5\x9bv\xc4\x81nara is bodiless. And that agni becomes (or\nis subdivided into) J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\x81gni (wisdom-fire), \xe1\xb8\x8car\xc5\x9ban\xc4\x81gni (eye-fire), and\nKoshth\xc4\x81gni (digestive fire). Of these J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81n\xc4\x81gni pertains to the mind;\nDar\xc5\x9ban\xc4\x81gni pertains to the senses; and Koshth\xc4\x81gni pertains to \xe1\xb8\x8dahara and daily\ncooks (or digests) equally whatever is eaten, drunk, licked, or sucked through\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and ap\xc4\x81na. Dar\xc5\x9ban\xc4\x81gni is (in) the eye itself and is the cause of vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na\nand enables one to see all objects of form. It has three seats, the\n(spiritual) eye itself being the (primary) seat, and the eyeballs being the\naccessory seats. \xe1\xb8\x8cakshi\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\x81gni is in the heart, G\xc4\x81rhapa\xe1\xb9\xadya is in the belly, and\nin the face is \xc4\x80havan\xc4\xabya. (In this sacrifice with the three agnis), the\nPurusha is himself the sacrificer; bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi becomes his wife; san\xe1\xb9\xadosha\n(contentment) becomes the \xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\xabksh\xc4\x81 (vow) taken; the mind and the organs of the\nsenses become the sacrificial vessels; the karmen\xe1\xb8\x8driyas (organs of action) are\nthe sacrificial instruments. In this sacrifice of the body, the several \xe1\xb8\x8devas\nwho become the \xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadvijas (sacrificial priests) perform their parts following the\nmaster of the sacrifice, ( _viz_., the true individuality), wherever he goes.\nIn this (sacrifice), the body is the sacrificial place,\n\np. 122\n\nthe skull of the head is the fire-pit, the hairs are the ku\xc5\x9ba grass; the mouth\nis the an\xe1\xb9\xadarve\xe1\xb8\x8di (raised platform in sacrifice); k\xc4\x81ma (or passion) is the\nclarified butter; the period of life is the period of sacrifice; n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8da (sound)\nproduced in \xe1\xb8\x8dahara (heart) is the s\xc4\x81mave\xe1\xb8\x8da (recited during the sacrifice);\nvaikhar\xc4\xab is the yajus (or yajurve\xe1\xb8\x8da hymns); par\xc4\x81, pa\xc5\x9byan\xe1\xb9\xadi, and ma\xe1\xb8\x8dhyam\xc4\x81 1 are\nthe \xe1\xb9\x9bks (or \xe1\xb9\x9bgve\xe1\xb8\x8da hymns); cruel words are the a\xe1\xb9\xadharvas (a\xe1\xb9\xadharvave\xe1\xb8\x8da hymns)\nand khilas (supplementary texts of each ve\xe1\xb8\x8da); true words are the vy\xc4\x81h\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadis 2.\nLife, strength, and bile are the pa\xc5\x9bus (sacrificial creatures) and death is\navabh\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xada (the bath which concludes the sacrifice). In this sacrifice, the\n(three) fires blaze up and then according to (the desires of) the\n[worldly](errata.htm#8), the \xe1\xb8\x8devas bless him. All who are living (in this\nworld) are the sacrificers. There is none living who does not perform yaj\xc3\xb1a\n(sacrifice). This body is (created) for yaj\xc3\xb1a, and arises out of yaj\xc3\xb1a and\nchanges according to yaj\xc3\xb1a. If this yaj\xc3\xb1a is continued in a direction changed\n(from the right course, or is abused), then it leads to an ocean of misery.\n\nIn this body, there are sixteen side-teeth, having each a membrane (as its\nroot) and fifteen openings. It (the body) is measured by ninety-six digits.\nThere are in it fourteen n\xc4\x81di seats and 108 joints. There are seventy-two\ntubes seats with seventy-two n\xc4\x81dis between them, of which three are important,\n_viz_., id\xc4\x81, pi\xe1\xb9\x85gal\xc4\x81, and sushumn\xc4\x81, the fourth is pur\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xadi, and jiva\xe1\xb9\xada the\nfifth. Above jiva\xe1\xb9\xada is bile and near bile is Pur\xc4\xab\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb9\xadi. Above the navel, two\ndigits to the left of it, is seated the source of bile. The food taken in is\ndivided into three parts--urine, faeces, and s\xc4\x81ra (the essence or chyme). The\nurine dividing itself into two, spreads to the left below the navel. The\nfaeces is in the right side and is of seven kinds. The s\xc4\x81ra is of five kinds\nand spreads itself over the body. Hence the semen and blood are produced from\nfood and drink. In this body, v\xc4\x81yu which is moving as pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a is the S\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma.\nThrough it, one inspires and expires and moves (his limbs). Without it, no\nlimb of the body will be\n\np. 123\n\nanimated. Through v\xc4\x81yu, the current of blood is driven into the midis from the\nchakra (plexus) of the heart, and those which can be touched (on the body) are\neasily discernible. The juicy essences (of food) which arise out of digestion\nenter the womb which is suspended in the stomach of the mother and coming near\nthe child\'s head nourishes the child\'s pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a through the sushumn\xc4\x81 (on the head\nor pineal gland). Sushumn\xc4\x81 is the Brahma-n\xc4\x81di. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a and others are found\nthere. It (pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a) descends lower and lower as the time of birth approaches and\nsettles in the heart when the child is born. Through yoga, it should be\nbrought from the middle of the eyebrows to the end of sushumn\xc4\x81 ( _viz_., the\npineal gland), when he becomes the cognizer of the Real like the child in the\nwomb. In the body of this nature, \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is latent and deathless, and is the\nwitness and Purusha. It lives in this body, being enveloped (by m\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81). Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab\n(or the j\xc4\xabva having pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a) has abhim\xc4\x81na (identification with the body) on\naccount of avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81. Aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na which surrounds it is the seed; the anta\xe1\xb8\xa5kara\xe1\xb9\x87a\n(internal organ) is the sprout and the body is the tree. In this tree (of\nbody), there are eight crores of hairs, eighty hundreds of joints, nine\nhundreds of tendons, eight palams of heart 1, twelve palams of tongue, one\npras\xe1\xb9\xadha (or two palams) of bile; one \xc4\x81dhaka of phlegm, one kudupa (or \xc2\xbc\npras\xe1\xb9\xadha) of \xc5\x9bukla and two pras\xe1\xb9\xadhas of marrow. One should consider everything\nas evanescent, like the child in the womb (with its pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, etc.,) stationed in\nthe sushumn\xc4\x81 (of the head). Then he becomes freed and gets no more body. If\nnot, an ignorant man becomes subject to the cycle of re-births, etc., is\nexposed like a worm to the drink of urine and faeces, and undergoes in this\nbody the sufferings of hell.
