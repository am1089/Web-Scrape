On account of the separate statement (of soul and intelligence).\n\nFrom the passage 'Having by knowledge taken possession of the body' which\nrepresents the soul and intelligence as separate, viz. as respectively the\nagent and the instrument of action, we understand that the soul pervades the\nbody only by means of intelligence, its quality.
