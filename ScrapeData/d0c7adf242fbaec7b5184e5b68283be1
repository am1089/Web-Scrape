'Waters are ye by name; happy ones are ye by name; sappy ones are ye by\nname; undecaying ones are ye by name; fearless ones are ye by name; immortal\nones are ye by name. Of you, being such, may I partake; receive me into your\nfavour'\xc2\x97with these words (the teacher) makes the student sip water three\ntimes,\n\n2 2. And hands over to him the staff with the five\n\np. 68\n\nverses, 'Blessing may give us' (Rig-veda V, 51, 11-15).\n\n3 3. An optional gift is the fee for the sacrifice.\n\n4 4. After (the teacher) has led him round the fire, turning his right side\ntowards it, (the student) goes through the village to beg food.\n\n5\\. (Let him beg,) however, of his mother first,\n\n6\\. Or of a woman who will not refuse.\n\n7 7. Having announced the alms to his teacher, he may eat (the food himself)\nwith the master's permission.\n\n8\\. The daily putting on of fuel, the going for alms, the sleeping on the\nground, and obedience to the teacher: these are the standing duties of a\nstudent.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[67:1-2](sbe29036.htm#fr_143) 6, 1, 2. Rama _k_ andra: '. . . with this Mantra\nwhich the teacher tells him, and which he (the student) pronounces, he sips\nwater p. 68 three times . . . He (the teacher) then gives him again the staff,\nwhich he had given him before silently.' I do not think that this double\nhanding over of the staff agrees with the real meaning of the text; Gobhila\nalso (II, 10) and \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana (I, 22, 1) prescribe the da _n_ _d_ apradana\nafter the repetition of the Savitri, without mentioning that the same had been\nalready done before; Paraskara II, 2, II speaks of the handing over of the\nstaff before the recital of the Savitri, and does not state that it should be\nrepeated afterwards.\n\nAll these ceremonies, the teaching of the Savitri as well as the da _n_ _d_\napradana, were considered as forming part of the Upanayana, even though a\nlonger or shorter space of time (chap. 5, 1-3) might elapse between the first\narrival of the student at the teacher's house and the performing of these\nrites. This follows from chap. 11, Sutras 2-4.\n\n[67:2](sbe29036.htm#fr_144) These five verses have already occurred above at\nI, 15, 12.\n\n[68:3](sbe29036.htm#fr_145) Comp.
