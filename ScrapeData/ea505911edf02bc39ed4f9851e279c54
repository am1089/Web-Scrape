In about the same year (1774 or 1775)\nwhen the first MS. of the Persian translation of the Upanishads was received\nby Anquetil Duperron, Rammohun Roy 3 was born in India, the reformer and\nreviver of the ancient religion of the Brahmans. A man who in his youth could\nwrite a book 'Against the Idolatry of all Religions,' and who afterwards\nexpressed in so many exact words his 'belief in the divine authority of Christ\n4' was not likely to retain anything of the sacred literature of his own\nreligion, unless he had perceived in it the same\n\np. lxiii\n\ndivine authority which he recognised in the teaching of Christ. He rejected\nthe Pura _n_ as, he would not have been swayed in his convictions by the\nauthority of the Laws of Manu, or even by the sacredness of the Vedas. He was\nabove all that. But he discovered in the Upanishads and in the so-called\nVedanta something different from all the rest, something that ought not to be\nthrown away, something that, if rightly understood, might supply the right\nnative soil in which alone the seeds of true religion, aye, of true\nChristianity, might spring up again and prosper in India, as they had once\nsprung up and prospered from out the philosophies of Origen or Synesius.\nEuropean scholars have often wondered that Rammohun Roy, in his defence of the\nVeda, should have put aside the Sa _m_ hitas and the Brahma _n_ as, and laid\nhis finger on the Upanishads only, as the true kernel of the whole Veda.\nHistorically, no doubt, he was wrong, for the Upanishads presuppose both the\nhymns and the liturgical books of the Veda. But as the ancient philosophers\ndistinguished in the Veda between the Karma-ka _n_ _d_ a and the _G_ \xc3\xb1ana-ka\n_n_ _d_ a, between works and knowledge; as they themselves pointed to the\nlearning of the sacred hymns and the performance of sacrifices as a\npreparation only for that enlightenment which was reserved as the highest\nreward for the faithful performance of all previous duties 1, Rammohun Roy,\nlike Buddha and other enlightened men before him, perceived that the time for\ninsisting on all that previous discipline with its minute prescriptions and\nsuperstitious observances was gone, while the knowledge conveyed in the\nUpanishads or the Vedanta, enveloped though it may be in strange coverings,\nshould henceforth form the foundation of a new religious life 2. He would\ntolerate nothing idolatrous, not even in his mother, poor woman, who after\njoining his most bitter opponents, confessed to her son, before she set out on\nher\n\np. lxiv\n\nlast pilgrimage to Juggernaut, where she died, that 'he was right, but that\nshe was a weak woman, and grown too old to give up the observances which were\na comfort to her.' It was not therefore from any regard of their antiquity or\ntheir sacred character that Rammohun Roy clung to the Upanishads, that he\ntranslated them into Bengali, Hindi, and English, and published them at his\nown expense. It was because he recognised in them seeds of eternal truth, and\nwas bold enough to distinguish between what was essential in them and what was\nnot,--a distinction, as he often remarked with great perplexity, which\nChristian teachers seemed either unable or unwilling to make 1.\n\nThe death of that really great and good man during his stay in England in\n1833, was one of the severest blows that have fallen on the prospects of\nIndia. But his work has not been in vain. Like a tree whose first shoot has\nbeen killed by one winter frost, it has broken out again in a number of new\nand more vigorous shoots, for whatever the outward differences may be between\nthe \xc3\x82di Brahmo Samaj of Debendranath Tagore, or the Brahmo Samaj of India of\nKeshub Chunder Sen, or the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, the common root of them all\nis the work done, once for all, by Rammohun Roy. That work may have\ndisappeared from sight for a time, and its present manifestations may seem to\nmany observers who are too near, not very promising. But in one form or\nanother, under one name or another, I feel convinced that work will live. 'In\nIndia,' Schopenhauer writes, 'our religion will now and never strike root: the\nprimitive wisdom of the human race will never be pushed aside there by the\nevents of Galilee. On the contrary, Indian wisdom will flow back upon Europe,\nand produce a thorough change in our knowing and thinking.' Here, again, the\ngreat philosopher seems to me to have allowed himself to be carried away too\nfar by his enthusiasm for the less known. He is blind for the dark sides of\nthe Upanishads, and he wilfully shuts his eyes against the bright rays of\neternal truth in the Gospels, which even\n\np. lxv\n\n[paragraph continues] Rammohun Roy was quick enough to perceive behind the\nmists and clouds of tradition that gather so quickly round the sunrise of\nevery religion.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[lxii:3](sbe01011.htm#fr_23) Born 1774, died at 2.30 A.M., on Friday, 28th\nSeptember, 1833.\n\n[lxii:4](sbe01011.htm#fr_24) Last Days of Rammohun Roy, by Mary Carpenter,\n1866, p. 135.\n\n[lxiii:1](sbe01011.htm#fr_25) M.
