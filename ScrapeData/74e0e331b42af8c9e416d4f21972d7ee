When they saw that Huri had come, the senses of all of them were\nrevived, just as the organs of perception are restored to animation, when life\nis revived in a dead man. Whilst they did not see him, their minds were in a\nstate of agitation, as though they had all been bitten by the mind-agitating\nsnake. Their troubles were ended on the arrival of him they loved, as creepers\nare revived by being sprinkled with the water of life. In the same way that\nthe lotus appears withered at night, but revives on beholding the splendour of\nthe sun, the large eyes of the women of Bruj were restored to animation on\nbeholding Krishnu.\n\nHaving recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, O great king! the\ncowherdesses, on seeing Shree Krishnu Chund, the root of joy, being all at\nonce released from the sea of despondency, approached him, and were as much\nrejoiced, as a man, drowning in the unfathomable ocean, would be to find a\nshallow place. And they collected round him on all sides.\n\np. 111\n\n[paragraph continues] Then Shree Krishnu took them with him to the place where\nthey had first engaged in festive songs and dances. On their arrival, one of\nthe cowherdesses took off her scarf, and spread it for Krishnu to sit down\nupon. As he sat down upon it, many of the cowherdesses were angry, and said,\n"O great king! you are very deceitful, and steal away the minds and wealth of\nothers, but do not respect the good qualities of any one."\n\nAfter this, they said to each other, "He has abandoned what is good, and\nembraced what is bad. Deceit suits his mind. Consider, friend! how can we\npossibly form an association with him."\n\nOn hearing this, one of them said, "Friends! do you remain apart; as we derive\nno benefit from our own speaking, I will make Krishnu himself speak." Saying\nthese words, she smiled and enquired from Shree Krishnu,--"O great king!\nexplain to us who is a good man, and who a bad man in the four following\ninstances:--One, who without having done a good action, shall expect good\nactions from others, (or shall expect to have his non-performance of good\nactions considered in the light of the performance of them:) a second shall\nmake a return for a good action: a third shall return evil for good: a fourth\nshall take no thought whatever of any good, that may be done to him." Shree\nKrishnu Chund replied, "All of you listen with attention, whilst I explain who\nis the good, and who the bad man, in the cases mentioned. The best is he who\ndoes good without receiving any, as a father loves a son. It is no virtue to\nreturn good for good, in the manner that a cow gives milk for the food she\nreceives. Consider as your enemy one who regards good and evil alike. The most\nungrateful of all is he who forgets good done to him."\n\nWhen the cowherdesses, on hearing these words and looking at each other, began\nto laugh, Shree Krishnu Chund was frightened, and said, "I am not to be\nreckoned amongst any of these four kinds of persons, which you seem to think\nby\n\np. 112\n\nyour laughing; moreover, it is my custom to grant the accomplishment of any\nwish or desire a person may ask from me. Perhaps you will say, if this is your\npractice, why did you abandon us in the jungle? The reason was, that I made\ntrial of your affection. Do not think ill of me for this, but believe what I\nsay."\n\nAfter this, he again said, "I have now tried you: remember and meditate upon\nme. You have increased your affection for me, who am like a poor man that has\nobtained wealth. You have met my wishes in every respect; and in doing so,\nhave foregone the reproach of the world, and the Vedas; just as a religious\ndevotee, who abandons his home, and entertains a love for Huri with sincerity\nof mind. If I should live for a hundred years of Bruhmu, I should never be\nquit of my debt to you."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXXIV](psa35.htm)\n\n'
