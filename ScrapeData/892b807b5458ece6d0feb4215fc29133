If a hundred improper acts, and even more, have been committed, and the\n(knowledge of the) 1\n\np. 130\n\n[paragraph continues] Veda is retained, the fire of the Veda destroys all (the\nguilt) of that man just as a (common) fire consumes fuel.\n\n2\\. As a fire that burns strongly consumes even green trees, even so the fire\nof the Veda destroys one's guilt caused by (evil) deeds.\n\n3\\. A Brahma _n_ a who remembers the Rig-veda is not tainted by any guilt,\nthough he has destroyed these (three) worlds and has eaten the food of all,\n(even of the most sinful) men. 3\n\n4\\. If (a Brahma _n_ a) relies on the power of the Veda, he cannot find\npleasure in sinful acts. Guilt (incurred) through ignorance and negligence is\ndestroyed, not (that of) other (intentional offences).\n\n5\\. If a hermit subsisting on roots and fruit practises austerities in a\nforest, and (a householder) recites a single _Ri_ _k_ , the merit of the acts\nof the one and of the other is equal.\n\n6\\. Let him strengthen the Veda by (studying) the Itihasas and Pura _n_ as.\nFor the Veda fears a man of little learning, (thinking) 'He will destroy me.'\n\n7\\. The daily recitation of the Veda and the performance, according to one's\nability, of the series of Mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as quickly destroy guilt, even that\nof mortal sins.\n\n8\\. Let him daily perform, without tiring, his particular rites which the Veda\nenjoins. For if he does that according to his ability, he will reach the most\nblessed state. 8\n\n9\\. Through sacrificing for wicked people, through teaching them, through\nintermarrying with them, and through receiving gifts from them, (learned)\n\np. 131\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahma _n_ as do not contract guilt, for (a learned\nBrahma _n_ a) resembles a fire and the sun.\n\n10\\. I will now declare the purification prescribed for (eating) food,\nregarding which doubts have arisen, whether it may be called fit to be eaten\nor not. Listen to my words!\n\n11\\. Let a Brahma _n_ a drink during three days the astringent decoction of\nthe Brahmasuvar _k_ ala plant, unmixed with salt or pungent condiments, and (a\ndecoction of) the _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khapushpi plant, together with milk.\n\n12\\. Let him drink water, after boiling in it Pala _s_ a and Bilva leaves, Ku\n_s_ a grass, and (leaves of) lotuses and Udumbara trees; after three days and\nno more he becomes pure. 12\n\n13\\. (Subsisting) during one day on each (of the following substances), cow's\nurine, cowdung, milk, sour milk, butter, and water in which Ku _s_ a grass has\nbeen boiled, and fasting on the seventh day purify even (him who fears that he\nhas partaken of the food of) a _S_ vapaka. 13\n\n14\\. He who lives during five days on cow's urine, cowdung, milk, sour milk,\nand clarified butter, is purified by means of (that) Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ agavya, (the\nfive products of the cow.)\n\n15\\. He who, in accordance with the rule, uses barley (for his food), becomes\npure even by ocular proof. (For) if he is pure, those (barley grains) will be\nwhite, if he is impure they will be discoloured. 15\n\n16\\. (If he makes) three morning meals of food 16\n\np. 132\n\nfit for a sacrifice and three evening meals in like manner, and if food given\nwithout asking (is his subsistence) in the same manner, (he will thus perform)\nthree fasts.\n\n17\\. Now if he is in haste to make (himself pure), (let him) subsist on air\nduring a day, and pass the night standing in water; (that penance) is equal to\na Pra _g_ apatya (K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra).\n\n18\\. But if at sunrise he mutters the Gayatri eight thousand times, he will be\nfreed from all mortal sins, provided he be not the slayer of a Brahma _n_ a.\n18\n\n19\\. He, forsooth, who has stolen (the gold of a Brahma _n_ a), has drunk\nspirituous liquor, has slain a learned Brahma _n_ a, or has violated his\nGuru's bed, will become free from all (these) mortal sins if he studies the\nInstitutes of the sacred law.\n\n20\\. For unlawful acts, for unlawful sacrifices, and for great sins (let him\nperform) a K _ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra and a _K_ andraya _n_ a, which destroy all\nguilt.\n\n21\\. Let him add daily one mouthful (to his food) during the bright (half of\nthe month), let him diminish it (daily by one mouthful) during the dark\n(half), and let him fast on the new-moon day; that is the rule for the _K_\nandraya _n_ a (or lunar penance). 21\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[129:1](sbe1430.htm#fr_691)-2. **XXVII**.
