Prayer for earthly and heavenly success.\n\n1\\. Upon this (person) the Vasus, Indra, Pushan, Varuna, Mitra, and Agni,\nshall bestow goods (vasu)! The \xc3\x82dityas, and, further, all the gods shall hold\nhim in the higher light!  \n2\\. Light, ye gods, shall be at his bidding: Surya (the sun), Agni (fire), or\neven gold! Inferior to us shall be our rivals! Cause him to ascend to the\nhighest heaven  \n3\\. With that most potent charm with which, O Gatavedas (Agni), thou didst\nbring to Indra the (soma-) drink, with that, O Agni, do thou here strengthen\nthis one; grant him supremacy over his kinsmen!  \n4\\. Their sacrifice and their glory, their increase of wealth and their\nthoughtful plans, I have usurped, O Agni. Inferior to us shall be our rivals!\nCause him to ascend to the highest heaven!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 38. Prayer for lustre and power](av141.htm)\n\n'
