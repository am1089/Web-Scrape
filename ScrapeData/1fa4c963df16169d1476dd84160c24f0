(1).\n\nCompared with all other means, knowledge is the only direct means to\nliberation. As cooking is impossible without fire, so is liberation impossible\nwithout knowledge. (2).\n\nRitual cannot dispel ignorance, because they are not mutually contradictory.\nBut knowledge\n\np. 161\n\nsurely destroys ignorance, as light destroys the densest darkness. (3).\n\nThe self appears to be conditioned by virtue of ignorance. But when that\n(ignorance) is destroyed, the unconditioned self shines by its own light, like\nthe sun when the clouds have disappeared. (4).\n\nHaving purified, by repeated instruction, the soul that is turbid with\nignorance, knowledge should efface itself, as the paste of the cleaning-nut\ndoes with water. * (5).\n\nThe phenomenal world, abounding in desire, hatred, etc., is verily like a\ndream. While\n\np. 162\n\nit lasts, it seems to be real, but, when one awakes, it becomes unreal. (6).\n\nLike the (illusion of) silver in mother-o\'-pearl, the world appears to be real\nonly until the Supreme Self, the immutable reality behind everything, is\nrealised. (7).\n\nLike bubbles in water, the worlds are born, remain and dissolve in the Supreme\nLord that is the material cause and foundation of all things. (8).\n\nOn the eternal Vishnu, who is pure existence and consciousness, as the common\nfactor, all these various appearances are superimposed, like wristlets and\nother forms on gold. (9).\n\np. 163\n\nLike space, the Lord Vishnu, coming in contact with various conditions,\nappears to be different by reason of their differences, but is seen to be\nundifferentiated when those (conditions) are destroyed. (10).\n\nOnly by virtue of varying conditions are caste, name, periods of religious\nlife, etc., imposed on the self, like taste, colour and other distinctions\nimposed on water. (11).\n\nThe place for experiencing happiness and misery, which is made up of the\nfivefold compounds of the great elements and is obtained as the result of past\nactions, is called the (dense) body. (12).\n\np. 164\n\nThe instrument of enjoyment, which is made up of the uncompounded elements and\nwhich consists of the five life-forces, the mind, the consciousness, and the\nten senses *, is the subtle body. (13).\n\nThe beginningless illusion that is indefinable is called the causal body. One\nshould understand the self as other than these three bodies (or conditions).\n(14).\n\nThe pure self, by the relation of the five sheaths, etc., appears to assume\ntheir respective natures, like a crystal reflecting a blue cloth, etc. (15).\n\np. 165\n\nOne should separate the grain of the pure inner self from the chaff of the\nbody and- other sheaths by the threshing of reason. (16).\n\nAlthough the self is at all times and in all things, yet it cannot shine in\neverything, but will shine only in the consciousness, just as a reflection\nwill appear only in polished surfaces. (17).\n\nOne should understand the self to be always like a king, different from the\nbody, senses, mind, consciousness, and eyes, the witness of their activities.\n(18).\n\np. 166\n\nTo the indiscriminating, the self appears to be active while (in reality) the\nsenses (alone) are active, in the same way that the moon is seen as if\nrunning, when the clouds move. (19).\n\nThe body, senses, mind and consciousness, carry on their respective activities\nby depending on the consciousness of the self, like men depending on the sun\'s\nlight. (20).\n\nOwing to indiscrimination, men attribute the qualities and activities of the\nbody and the senses to the self that is pure existence and consciousness *, in\nthe same way as blue colour is attributed to the sky. (21).\n\np. 167\n\nMoreover, the nature of doer, etc., that belongs to the conditioning mind, is\nattributed to the self, just as the motion, etc., of water is attributed to\nthe refection of the moon therein. (22).\n\nPassions, desires, happiness, misery, etc., exercise their function when the\nconsciousness is present, and do not exist in deep sleep when the\nconsciousness is absent. They belong, therefore, to the consciousness and not\nto the self. (23).\n\nAs light is the very nature of the sun, coldness of water, heat of fire, so\nare being, consciousness, bliss, eternity and absoluteness the very nature of\nthe self. (24).\n\np. 168\n\nBy indiscriminately mixing up the aspect of being and consciousness of the\nself with the function of the individual consciousness, there springs up the\nidea "I know." (25).\n\nThe self undergoes no modification, nor can knowledge arise in any manner from\nindividual consciousness (alone). And yet, one ignorantly imagines that the\nindividual soul knows, does and sees everything well. (26).\n\nBy mistaking the self to be the individual soul, as a rope for a serpent, one\nis subject to fear. But if he realises, "I am not the individual soul, but the\nSupreme Self," then he is free from fear. (27).\n\np. 169\n\nThe self alone illumines the consciousness; the senses, etc., as a light\nreveals the pot and other objects; (but) one\'s own self is not illumined by\nthe illuminable objects. * (28).\n\nThe very nature of the self being knowledge, it does not depend, for a\nknowledge of itself, on any other knowledge, in the same way as a light does\nnot need another light to reveal itself. (29).\n\nEliminating all limitations with the help of the passage "not this, not this,"\none should realise the identity of the individual soul and the supreme self by\nmeans of the principal scriptural passages. (30).\n\np. 170\n\nThe body and other objects of perception are the products of ignorance and are\nas evanescent as bubbles. The self that is unconditioned is other than these\nand should be understood as "I am Brahman." (31).\n\nBirth, old age, decay, death, etc., are not for me, because I am other than\nthe body. Sound and other objects of sense have no connection with me, for I\nam other than the senses. (32).\n\nI am not the mind, and, therefore, sorrow, desire, hatred, fear, etc., are not\nfor me. As declared by the scripture, the self is neither the senses nor mind,\nbut is unconditioned. (33).\n\np. 171\n\nI am attributeless, functionless, eternal, doubtless, stainless, changeless,\nformless, eternally free, and unconditioned. (34).\n\nLike ether, I pervade everything, inside and outside. I am imperishable, ever\nthe established (truth), alike to all, unattached, unconditioned,\nimperturbable. (35).\n\nI am that very supreme Brahman that is reality, knowledge and infinity, that\nis ever unconditioned and ever free, the one undivided bliss that is without a\nsecond. (36).\n\nSuch incessant impression on the mind that "I am only Brahman" removes the\nturbulences of ignorance, as the elixir of life cures all diseases. (37).\n\np. 172\n\nSitting in a lonely place, free of all passions, with the senses subjugated,\none should contemplate that one infinite self, without thinking of anything\nelse. (38).\n\nA wise man should, by his intelligence, submerge, in the self all that is\nobjective and should ever contemplate the one self that is like unlimited\nspace. (39).\n\nOne who has realised the supreme truth gives up everything, such as form,\ncaste, etc., and abides, by nature, in (the self that is) infinite\nconsciousness and bliss. (40).\n\np. 173\n\nThe distinction of knower, knowledge and the known does not exist in respect\nof the supreme self. Being sole consciousness and bliss, it shines by itself\nalone. (41).\n\nThe flame of knowledge that arises by this constant churning of meditation on\nthe wood * of the self, will completely burn away the fuel of ignorance. (42).\n\nWhen knowledge has destroyed ignorance, the self will manifest itself, in the\nsame way as the sun rises as soon as the dawn \xe2\x80\xa0 of day has dispelled darkness.\n(43).\n\np. 174\n\nThe self, that is ever with us, appears, by ignorance, as if it were\nunattained and, when that (ignorance) is destroyed, attained, like one\'s own\nnecklace. * (44).\n\nThe condition of individual soul has been imposed on Brahman by illusion, as\nthe form of a man on a post, but disappears when the true nature of the\nindividual soul is realised. (45).\n\nThe knowledge that arises from the realisation of one\'s own true nature,\ndirectly destroys the illusion of "I" and "mine" which resembles the confusion\nof the directions. \xe2\x80\xa0 (46).\n\np. 175\n\nThe devotee ( _yogin_ ) that has gained right realisation sees all things, by\nthe eye of knowledge, as existing in his own self, and the one self as all\nthings. (47).\n\nHe sees all things as his own self in the same way as one sees pots, etc., as\n(mere) clay; (for), all this universe is only the self, and there is naught\nother than the self. (48).\n\nLiberation-while-living means that the wise person, having abandoned his\nformer limitations and qualities, and acquiring the properties of being,\nconsciousness (and bliss), attains Brahman, in the same way as the worm\nbecomes the wasp. (49).\n\np. 176\n\nHaving crossed the ocean of ignorance and having slain the demons of likes and\ndislikes, etc., the seer, united to tranquillity, is supremely happy in the\nenjoyment of the bliss of his own self *. (50).\n\nLeaving aside all attachments to external and transient pleasures, and happy\nin the bliss of the self, such a one, for ever, shines within, like a light\ninside a globe. (51).\n\nThe seer, though remaining amidst limitations, should yet be unaffected by\ntheir qualities, like space. Knowing all, he should be like one that knows\nnot, and should wander about, unattached, like the wind. (52).\n\np. 177\n\nWhen the limitations disappear, the seer merges unreservedly in the Supreme (\n_vishnu_ ), like water in water, space in space, or light in light. (53).\n\nThan gaining which there is no greater gain, than whose bliss there is no\nhigher bliss, than knowing which there is no higher knowledge,--that should be\nunderstood as Brahman. (54).\n\nSeeing which naught else remains to be seen, becoming which there is no\nbecoming * again, knowing which naught else remains to be known,--that should\nhe understood as Brahman. (55).\n\nThat which is all-pervading, around, above, below, which is being,\nconsciousness and bliss,\n\np. 178\n\nwhich is without a second, without end, eternal, sole,--that should be\nunderstood as Brahman. (56).\n\nThe immutable, the one uninterrupted bliss, which is indicated by the Vedanta\nby excluding what is not it,--that should be understood as Brahman. (57).\n\n(The four-faced) Brahma and others, that are but parts of that self which is\nuninterrupted bliss, become happy, each in his own degree, by possessing a\nparticle of that bliss. (58).\n\nEvery object (is such because. it) possesses that. All activity has\nconsciousness running through it *. The Supreme Self, therefore, pervades\n\np. 179\n\nthe whole universe, as butter is in every part of milk. (59).\n\nThat which is neither subtle nor dense, neither short nor long, which is\nunborn, immutable, devoid of form, quality, caste or name,--that should be\nunderstood as Brahman. (60).\n\nBy whose light the sun, etc., shine, but which is not illumined by these that\nare illuminable, and by virtue of which all this (universe) shines *,--that\nshould be understood as Brahman. (61).\n\nPervading the whole universe, internally and externally, and illumining it,\nthe Brahman shines by itself, like a red-hot iron ball. (62).\n\np. 180\n\nThe Brahman is different from the universe. There is naught other than\nBrahman. If anything other than Brahman is perceived, it is as unreal as the\nmirage in the desert. (63).\n\nWhatever is seen or heard, other than Brahman, cannot be (real). Even that is\nBrahman, the secondless being, consciousness and bliss, when the reality is\nknown. (64).\n\nHe who has the eye of knowledge sees Brahman that is being, consciousness and\nbliss, in all things; but he who has not the eye of knowledge cannot see it\nthus, as a blind man cannot see the shining sun. (65).\n\np. 181\n\nThe individual soul, melted in the fire of knowledge kindled by instruction,\netc., is freed from all taints, like gold, and shines by itself. (66).\n\nThe self is the sun of knowledge that, rising in the firmament of the heart,\ndestroys the darkness of ignorance, and, pervading all and supporting all,\nshines--and makes everything shine. (67).\n\nHe who, unmindful of (the limitations of) direction, space, time, etc., and\nperfectly tranquil, attains the sanctum of the self, that is the all-\npervading, stainless, eternal bliss\n\np. 182\n\nwhich dispels (all qualities like heat and) cold, etc.,--he becomes all-\nknowing, all-pervading, and immortal. (68).\n\n\n\n\n\nThus ends Knowledge of Self.\n\n____\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[161:*](wos08.htm#fr_154) The cleaning-nut, rubbed into a paste and thrown\ninto dirty water, clears the water and itself settles down along with the dirt\nas a sediment.\n\n[164:*](wos08.htm#fr_155) The five senses of perception and the five motor\nmembers of the body.\n\n[166:*](wos08.htm#fr_156) The self is absolute consciousness as distinguished\nfrom _buddhi_ , the individual consciousness.\n\n[169:*](wos08.htm#fr_157) The mind, senses, etc.\n\n[173:*](wos08.htm#fr_158) Ara\xe1\xb9\x87i wood, used to kindle fire for sacrifices by\nchurning it.\n\n[173:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos08.htm#fr_159) Aru\xe1\xb9\x87a, the charioteer of the sun; the dawn-god.\n\n[174:*](wos08.htm#fr_160) One appears to search for his necklace and find it,\nalthough it has been on his neck all the time.\n\n[174:\xe2\x80\xa0](wos08.htm#fr_161) One who mistakes the directions, north, east, etc.,\ncorrects himself as soon as be clearly understands his own position.\n\n[176:*](wos08.htm#fr_162) This an allegorical explanation, incidentally, of\nthe story of the Ramaya\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\n[177:*](wos08.htm#fr_163) Birth.\n\n[178:*](wos08.htm#fr_164) These are the _sat_ (being) and _chit_\n(consciousness) aspects of the self.
