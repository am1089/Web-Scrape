That is\nwhy he looks so innocent.\n\nBaby had a heap of gold and pearls, yet he came like a beggar on to this\nearth.\n\nIt is not for nothing he came in such a disguise.\n\nThis dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly helpless, so that he\nmay beg for mother's wealth of love.\n\nBaby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny crescent moon.\n\nIt was not for nothing he gave up his freedom.\n\nHe knows that there is room for endless joy in mother's little corner of a\nheart, and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught and pressed in her dear\narms.\n\nBaby never knew how to cry. He dwelt in the land of perfect bliss.\n\nIt is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears.\n\nThough with the smile of his dear face he draws mother's yearning heart to\nhim, yet his little cries over tiny troubles weave the double bond of pity and\nlove.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Unheeded Pageant](cm07.htm)\n\n"
