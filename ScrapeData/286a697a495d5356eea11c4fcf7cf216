He seizes one for Agni as the first victim,\nand one for Varu _n_ a (as the last); then again one for Agni.: in this way\nlet him perform with the set of eleven victims 2.\n\n4:6:3:22\\. Or one may day after day seize a victim for Indra and Agni; for all\nthe gods are Agni, since in Agni offering is made to all the deities; and\nIndra is the deity of the sacrifice: thus he neither offends any of the\ndeities, nor does he offend him who is the deity of the sacrifice.\n\n4:6:3:33\\. Then as to the manner (of animal offering) in accordance with the\nStoma 3. At the Agnish _t_ oma\n\np. 429\n\nlet him seize a (victim) for Agni; for it is befitting that at the Agnish _t_\noma ('Agni's praise') he should seize a victim for Agni. If it be an Ukthya\nsacrifice, let him seize as the second (victim) one for Indra and Agni, for\nthe hymns (uktha) 1 belong to Indra and Agni. If it be a Sho _d_ a _s_ in\nsacrifice, let him seize as the third (victim) one for Indra; for the Sho _d_\na _s_ in (graha) is Indra. If it be an Atiratra, let him seize as the fourth\n(victim) one for Sarasvati; for Sarasvati is Va _k_ (speech), and Va _k_ is a\nfemale, and so is ratri (fem., 'night') female. Thus he duly distinguishes\nbetween the sacrificial performances. Such are the three manners (of animal\noffering): he may perform in whichever manner he pleases. Two victims must\nneeds be seized,--for Surya he seizes the second en the Vishuvant day, and for\nPra _g_ apati at the Mahavrata.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[428:2](sbe2672.htm#fr_998) See [III, 9, 1, 5](sbe2636.htm#3:9:1:5) seq. He is\nto sacrifice one victim each day, and if after the eleventh day, the\nperformance is to go on (as at the Dvada _s_ aha), he is to begin anew with\nthe first victim of the ekada _s_ ini. According to the Ka _n_ va text and\nKaty. XII, 6, 17 he is on such an odd day to immolate all the remaining\nvictims of the set of eleven. Thus on the last (twelfth) day of the Dvada _s_\naha--the Udayaniya Atiratra--he would have to sacrifice the entire set of\neleven victims.\n\n[428:3](sbe2672.htm#fr_999) I.e. the particular form of the _G_ yotish _t_\noma, which is being performed.\n\n[429:1](sbe2672.htm#fr_1000) That is, the hymns of the Rig-veda, the single\ncollections of which begin with the hymns to Agni, followed by those to Indra.\nThe 'ukthani' here can scarcely refer to the three additional _s_ astras of\nthe Ukthya sacrifice, as they are composed of hymns to Indra-Varu _n_ a,\nIndra-B _ri_ haspati, and Indra-Vish _n_ u respectively. \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r.
