Rama _k_ andra: 'Let him make one, or three,\nor five knots, according to (the student's) \xc3\x82rsheya,' i.e. accordingly as he\nbelongs to a family that invokes, in the Pravara ceremony, one, or three, or\nfive _Ri_ shis as their ancestors.

A similar dialogue between the teacher and\nthe student at the Upanayana is given in the Kau _s_ ika-sutra (ap. Weber,\nIndische Studien, X, 71). The student there says, 'Make me an \xc3\x82rsheya (a\ndescendant of the _Ri_ shis) and one who has relations, and initiate me.' And\nthe teacher replies, 'I make thee an \xc3\x82rsheya and one who has relations, and I\ninitiate thee.' As in this passage of the Kau _s_ ika-sutra the teacher is\nrepresented as having the power of making, by the Upanayana ceremony, an\n\xc3\x82rsheya of the student, thus, according to the view expressed by Professor\nWeber (loc. cit., p. 72 seq.), _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana would even give it into the\nteacher's power to make the student his samanarsheya, i.e. to extend his own\n\xc3\x82rsheya on as many pupils as he likes. Professor Weber understands the sixth\nSutra so that the teacher would have to say, samanarsheyo bhavan bruhi (Naraya\n_n_ a: bhavan bruhiti brahma _k_ ari bhavan bruhity ata _h_ [Sutra 8] si _m_\nhavalokananyayenatranusha _g_ yate. According to Rama _k_ andra's Paddhati he\nis p. 63 only to say samanarsheya _h_ ). The student answers, samanarsheyo\n\xc2\x92ham bho; Professor Weber, who supplies the imperative asani, translates this,\n'May I have the same \xc3\x82rsheya, sir!'\n\nI think it more natural to simply translate the teacher's question, 'Art thou\nsamanarsheya?' (or, supplying bhavan bruhi from Sutra 8, 'Declare that thou\nart samanarsheya'), and the student's reply, I am samanarsheya, sir!' Thus we\nought possibly to consider these formulas, which state a fictitious, ideal\nsamanarsheyatva of the teacher and the students as a trace, and as far as I\ncan see as the only trace, of an ancient rule requiring a real samanarsheyatva\nof teacher and student. As long as the ritual differences between the\ndifferent Gotras, of which, as is well known, only a few traces have survived\nin the Vedic tradition, had retained their full importance, it can indeed\nscarcely have been considered as admissible that a young Brahma _n_ a should\nbe confided to the guidance of a teacher who sacrificed and invoked the gods\nin another way than the customs of the pupil's own family required.\n\n[63:11](sbe29032.htm#fr_131) Naraya _n_ a: dakshi _n_ ottarabhya _m_ dakshi\n_n_ a uttara upari yayos tau dakshi _n_ ottarau, &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3](sbe29033.htm)\n\n"
