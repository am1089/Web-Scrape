But (there takes place) denotation of the superintending (deities), on\naccount of the difference and the connexion.\n\nThe word 'but' discards the doubt raised. We are\n\np. 304\n\nnot entitled to base the assumption of the elements and the sense organs being\nof an intellectual nature on such passages as 'the earth spoke,' &c. because\n'there takes place denotation of that which presides.' In the case of actions\nlike speaking, disputing, and so on, which require intelligence, the\nscriptural passages denote not the mere material elements and organs, but\nrather the intelligent divinities which preside over earth, &c., on the one\nhand, and Speech, &c., on the other hand. And why so? 'On account of the\ndifference and the connexion.' The difference is the one previously referred\nto between the enjoying souls, on the one hand, and the material elements and\norgans, on the other hand, which is founded on the distinction between\nintelligent and non-intelligent beings; that difference would not be possible\nif all beings were intelligent. Moreover, the Kaushitakins in their account of\nthe dispute of the pra _n_ as make express use of the word 'divinities' in\norder to preclude the idea of the mere material organs being meant, and in\norder to include the superintending intelligent beings. They say, 'The deities\ncontending with each for who was the best;' and, again, 'All these deities\nhaving recognised the pre-eminence in pra _n_ a' (Kau. Up. II, l4).--And,\nsecondly, Mantras, Arthavadas, Itihasas, Pura _n_ as, &c. all declare that\nintelligent presiding divinities are connected with everything. Moreover, such\nscriptural passages as 'Agni having become Speech entered into the mouth'\n(Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 4, 2, 4) show that each bodily organ is connected with its own\nfavouring divinity. And in the passages supplementary to the quarrel of the\npra _n_ as we read in one place how, for the purpose of settling their\nrelative excellence, they went to Pra _g_ apati, and how they settled their\nquarrel on the ground of presence and absence, each of them, as Pra _g_ apati\nhad advised, departing from the body for some time ('They went to their father\nPra _g_ apati and said,' &c.; _Kh_. Up. V, 1, 7); and in another place it is\nsaid that they made an offering to pra _n_ a (B _ri_. Up. VI, 1, 13), &c.; all\nof them proceedings which are analogous to those of men, &c., and therefore\nstrengthen the hypothesis that the text refers to the superintending\n\np. 305\n\ndeities. In the case of such passages as, 'Fire thought,' we must assume that\nthe thought spoken of is that of the highest deity which is connected with its\neffects as a superintending principle--From all this it follows that this\nworld is different in nature from Brahman, and hence cannot have it for its\nmaterial cause.\n\nTo this objection raised by the purvapakshin the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 6](sbe34145.htm)\n\n"
