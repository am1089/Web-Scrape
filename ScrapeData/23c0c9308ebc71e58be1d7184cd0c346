'Will 2 (sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa) is better than mind. For when a man wills, then he\nthinks in his mind, then he sends forth speech, and he sends it forth in a\nname. In a name the sacred hymns are contained, in the sacred hymns all\nsacrifices.\n\n2\\. 'All these therefore (beginning with mind and\n\np. 113\n\nending in sacrifice) centre in will, consist of will, abide in will. Heaven\nand earth willed, air and ether willed, water and fire willed. Through the\nwill of heaven and earth &c. rain wills; through the will of rain food wills;\nthrough the will of food the vital airs will; through the will of the vital\nairs the sacred hymns will; through the will of the sacred hymns the\nsacrifices will; through the will of the sacrifices the world (as their\nreward) wills; through the will of the world everything wills\n[1](sbe01139.htm#fn_305). This is will. Meditate on will.\n\n3\\. 'He who meditates on will as Brahman, he, being himself safe, firm, and\nundistressed, obtains the safe, firm, and undistressed worlds which he has\nwilled; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as will reaches--he who\nmeditates on will as Brahman.'\n\n'Sir, is there something better than will?'\n\n'Yes, there is something better than will.'\n\n'Sir, tell it me.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[112:2](sbe01138.htm#fr_306) Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa is elsewhere defined as a modification\nof manas. The commentator says that, like thinking, it is an activity of the\ninner organ. It is difficult to find any English term exactly corresponding to\nsa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa. Rajendralal Mitra translates it by will, but it implies not only\nwill, but at the same time conception, determination, and desire.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VII, 5](sbe01139.htm)\n\n"
