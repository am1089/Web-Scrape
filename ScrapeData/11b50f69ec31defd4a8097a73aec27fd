On even ground, which is covered with grass, which cannot be destroyed (by\ninundations, &c.),\n\n3\\. On which the waters flow off to the east or to the north,\n\n4\\. On which plants grow which have no milky juice or thorns, and which are\nnot acrid.\n\n5\\. The earth should be white, if he is a Brahma _n_ a,\n\n6\\. Red, if he is a Kshatriya,\n\n7\\. Black, if he is a Vai _s_ ya.\n\n8\\. (The soil should be) compact, one-coloured, not dry, not salinous, not\nsurrounded by sandy desert, not swampy.\n\n9\\. (Soil) on which Darbha grass grows, (should be chosen) by one who is\ndesirous of holy lustre,\n\n10\\. (Soil covered) with big sorts of grass, by one who is desirous of\nstrength,\n\n11\\. (Soil covered) with tender grass, by one who is desirous of cattle.\n\np. 121\n\n12\\. (The site of the house) should have the form of a brick,\n\n13\\. Or it should have the form of a round island.\n\n14\\. Or there should be natural holes (in the ground) in all directions.\n\n15\\. On such (ground) one who is desirous of fame or strength, should build\nhis house with its door to the east;\n\n16\\. One who is desirous of children or of cattle, (should build it) with its\ndoor to the north;\n\n17\\. One who is desirous of all (those things), (should build it) with its\ndoor to the south.\n\n18\\. Let him not build it with its door to the west.\n\n19. 19 And a back-door.\n\n20\\. The house-door.\n\n21\\. So that (he?) may not be exposed to looks (?).\n\np. 122\n\n22. 22 \'Let him avoid an A _s_ vattha tree on the east-side (of his house), and a Plaksha on the south-side, a Nyagrodha on the west-side, and on the north-side an Udumbara.\n\n23\\. \'One should say that an A _s_ vattha brings (to the house) danger from\nfire; one should say that a Plaksha tree brings early death (to the\ninhabitants of the house), that a Nyagrodha brings oppression through\n(hostile) arms, that an Udumbara brings diseases of the eye.\n\n24\\. \'The A _s_ vattha is sacred to the sun, the Plaksha to Yama, the\nNyagrodha is the tree that belongs to Varu _n_ a, the Udumbara, to Pra _g_\napati.\'\n\n25. 25 He should place those (trees) in another place than their proper one,\n\n26. 26 And should sacrifice to those same deities.\n\n27. 27 Let him put wood on the fire in the middle of the house, and sacrifice a black cow,\n\n28\\. Or a white goat,\n\np. 123\n\n29\\. (The one or the other) together with milk-rice.\n\n30\\. Or (only) milk-rice.\n\n31\\. Having mingled together the fat (of the animal), \xc3\x82 _g_ ya, its flesh, and\nthe milk-rice,\n\n32\\. He should take eight portions (of that mixture) and should sacrifice (the\nfollowing eight oblations):\n\n33\\. The first (verse, accompanying the first oblation), is, \'Vastoshpati!\'\n(MB. II, 6, 1).\n\n34. 34 (Then follow) the (three) verses of the Vamadevya,\n\n35\\. (And the three) Mahavyah _ri_ tis.\n\n36. 36 The last (oblation is offered with the formula), \'To Pra _g_ apati (svaha).\'\n\n37\\. After he has sacrificed, he should offer ten Balis,\n\n38\\. In the different directions (of the horizon), from left to right,\n\n39\\. And in the intermediate points,\n\n40\\. In due order, without a transposition.\n\n41\\. (He should offer a Bali) in the east with (the formula), \'(Adoration) to\nIndra!\' in the intermediate direction\xc2\x97\'To Vayu!\' in the south\xc2\x97\'To Yama!\' in\nthe intermediate direction\xc2\x97\'(Svadha) to the Fathers!\' in the west\xc2\x97\'(Adoration)\nto Varu _n_ a!\' in the intermediate direction\xc2\x97\'To Mahara _g_ a!\' in the\nnorth\xc2\x97\'To Soma!\' in the intermediate direction\xc2\x97\'To Mahendra!\' downwards\xc2\x97\n\np. 124\n\n[paragraph continues] \'To Vasuki!\' upwards, in the sky (i.e. throwing the Bali\ninto the air), with (the formula), \'Adoration to Brahman!\'\n\n42\\. To the east, upwards, and downwards this should be done constantly, day\nby day.\n\n43. 43 (The whole ceremony is repeated) every year or at the two sacrifices of the first fruits.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[120:1](sbe30039.htm#fr_422) 7, 1 seq. Comp. Khadira-G _ri_ hya IV, 2, 6 seq.\n\n[121:19](sbe30039.htm#fr_423) 19-21. I have translated the words of these\nSutras without trying to express any meaning. According to the commentary the\nmeaning is the following: 19. He should not build a house which has its door\non the back-side, or which has one front-door and one back-door. 20. The\nhouse-door should not face the door of another house. 21. The house-door\nshould be so constructed that the householder cannot be seen by _K_ a _n_ _d_\nalas, &c., when he is performing religious acts or when dining in his house.\nOr, if instead of sa _m_ loki the reading sa _m_ loki is accepted, the Sutra\nmeans: the house-door should be so constructed, that valuable objects, &c.,\nwhich are in the house, cannot be seen by passers-by.\xc2\x97The commentary on\nKhadira-G _ri_ hya IV, 2, 15 contains the remark: dvaradvaya _m_ (var. lectio,\ndvara _m_  dvara _m_ ) parasparam _ri_ _g_ u na syad iti ke _k_ it. This seems\nto me to lead to the right understanding of these Sutras. I think we ought to\nread and to divide in this way: (19) anudvara _m_ _k_ a. (20. 21) g _ri_\nhadvara _m_ yatha na sa _m_ loki syat. \'And (let him construct) a back-door,\nso that it does not face the (chief) house-door.\' The Khadira MSS. have the\nreadings, asalloki, asandraloke, sa _m_ loka.\n\n[122:22](sbe30039.htm#fr_424) 22-24. These are _S_ lokas to which the\ncommentary very appropriately, though not exactly in the sense in which it was\noriginally set down, applies the dictum so frequently found in the Brahma _n_\na texts: na hy ekasmad aksharad viradhayanti. Dr. Knauer\'s attempts to restore\ncorrect _S_ lokas are perhaps a little hazardous; he inserts in the third\nverse _k_ a after plakshas, and in the second he changes the first bruyat into\n_k_ a, whereby the second foot of the hemistich loses its regular shape\n![](img/12200.jpg), and receives instead of it the form  ![](img/12201.jpg).\n\n[122:25](sbe30039.htm#fr_425) He should remove an A _s_ vattha tree from the\neast-side, &c.\n\n[122:26](sbe30039.htm#fr_426) He should sacrifice to the deities to whom the\ntransplanted trees are sacred.\n\n[122:27](sbe30039.htm#fr_427) 27 seq. Here begins the description of the vastu\n_s_ amana, which extends to Sutra 43. As to the animal sacrifice prescribed in\nthis Sutra, comp. Dr. Winternitz\'s essay, Einige Bemerkungen uber das Bauopfer\nbei den Indern (Sitzungsbericht der Anthrop. Gesellschaft in Wien, 19 April,\n1887), p. 8.\n\n[123:34](sbe30039.htm#fr_428) Comp. above, chap. 6, 7 note.\n\n[123:36](sbe30039.htm#fr_429) The commentary says: \'The last oblation should\nbe offered with the formula, "To Pra _g_ apati svaha!"\' Probably we ought to\ncorrect the text, Pra _g_ apata ity uttama, \'the last (verse) is, "Pra _g_\napati!" (MB. II, 5, 8);\' see above, IV, 6, 9; Khadira-G _ri_ hya IV, 2, 20.\n\n[124:43](sbe30039.htm#fr_430) See above, III, 8, 9 seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 8](sbe30040.htm)\n\n'
