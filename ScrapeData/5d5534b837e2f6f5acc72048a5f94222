There is no travelling on this Path, it is stated, for one is\nnot going from one place to another, or even from one mental condition to\nanother. The goal on this path is most occult, hidden from both sense and\nmind, but is revealed when there is cessation of the ordinary manner of life,\nwhich could well be called the way of error and sorrow. The goal is indeed\ncalled a ceasing, not a gaining; it is a ceasing of the\n\np. 126\n\nerror or ignorance of desiring and seeking\xc2\x97lo here, lo there. This is called\n_nibbanna_ or _nirv \xc4\x81na_.\n\nBefore describing the Path we must see what Buddha\'s great discovery was. It\nwas the discovery that great indescribable joy comes to the man who realizes\nthe universality of sorrow. It comes because he is thereby released from the\nsense of dependence upon material things and the craving for them. You are\nclinging to sorrow and suffering. In your ignorance you hug and kiss the\nspokes of this wheel of agony.\n\nThis doctrine was formulated as Four Noble Truths: The Universality of Sorrow\nor Suffering; The Cause of Sorrow; The Ceasing of Sorrow; and The Way of the\nCeasing of Sorrow. We are a little handicapped in using the English language\nto express the central idea of this doctrine, for we have not one single word,\nas Buddha had, to express both bodily and psychological suffering, both pain\nand sorrow. Perhaps suffering will be the best word to use. Perhaps we shall\nsee, if we examine our heart\'s desire closely, that if we had it fulfilled\nthere would still be suffering. Some may say that they will accept suffering\nif they can have some pleasure as well. Shelley said that man looks before and\nafter, and longs for what is not, and Shakespeare went further and pointed out\nthat even if man has what he wants, the thought of time with its changes and\nuncertainties\n\np. 127\n\ndestroys his happiness. And Robert Burns mentioned that in one respect the\nlife of a mouse was happier than that of a man\xc2\x97the present only troubles it.\nIt is here that the revelation of Buddha came in\xc2\x97the assertion that from his\nown experience there is the incredible joy of nirv\xc4\x81na for those who put aside\nthis error of seeking or expecting happiness from circumstances.\n\nBuddha did not leave people to grope their way out of error and craving. His\nfourth Truth is called a Path\xc2\x97the Noble Eightfold Path. This means that there\nare eight things to do which, if successfully done, are ways of living without\nsorrow. We have now to examine this path, remembering always that there can be\nno cheating, that this path cannot be used for the purpose of attaining\nsomething that is within the wheel of sorrow, whether an object of the body or\na quality of the mind.\n\nIn the naming of the eight requirements of the Path there is a reiteration of\nthe word "correct" or "proper" at the beginning of each. The first four answer\nthe question, "How does the pilgrim comport himself in thought, speech and\naction on all occasions?" The second four point to special efforts he must\nmake in his life. The first four are as follows:\n\n1\\. Correct understanding, views, outlook, appraisal, judgment.\n\np. 128\n\n2\\. Correct aims, motives, plans, considerations, decision.\n\n3\\. Correct use of speech.\n\n4\\. Correct behavior, conduct or actions.\n\nAnalyzing these and other modes of living in my book _Character-Building_ many\nyears ago, I reduced all the defects of human nature to three: laziness,\nselfishness and thoughtlessness, and all virtues to three, action, goodwill\nand thoughtfulness. These three touchstones are implied in the word "correct"\nin each of the four requirements. No. I implies that one has at the outset\nadopted the outlook described by Buddha, what is called the _dhamma_ (\n_dharma_ ), law, rule, or proper way of life. _Dharma_ means maintenance\xc2\x97the\nmaintenance on all occasions, in all matters of life, small or great, of the\nresolution to put an end to pain, which is the basis of the three virtues of\naction, goodwill and thoughtfulness. These three are to be followed regardless\nof pain or trouble. Much stress is laid on speech for it is in this that\ndissipation of life most commonly occurs\xc2\x97idle chatter, cruel gossip and talk\nwithout information.\n\nThe second group of four requirements assigns the tasks:\n\n5\\. Correct mode of livelihood\xc2\x97the fulfilling of a definite role in life,\nwhich shall be unselfish, sensible, useful.\n\np. 129\n\n6\\. Correct effort\xc2\x97some work of doing good.\n\n7\\. Correct intellectual activity\xc2\x97some study.\n\n8\\. Correct contemplation\xc2\x97the expectant poise of the mind which allows\nintuition and insight to begin.\n\nAll these eight have to do with daily life and the use of personal abilities\nand energies in the world. They may be pursued with less or greater\ndetermination and constancy; as Edwin Arnold puts it in his beautiful poem\n_The Light of Asia_ :\n\nStrong limbs may dare the rugged road which storms,  \n  Soaring and perilous, the mountain\'s breast;  \nThe weak must wind from slower ledge to ledge,  \n  With many a place of rest.\n\nSo is the Eightfold Path which brings to peace;  \n  By lower or by upper heights it goes.  \nThe firm soul hastes, the feeble tarries. All  \n  Will reach the sunlit snows.\n\nNow we have to look at the inner or esoteric aspect of all this, and answer\nthe question: "What is happening to the pilgrim himself?" For this purpose\nBuddha gave the four stages of the Path, and showed what are the defects or\n"fetters" which bind the ordinary man, and how they are to be thrown off one\nafter the other. The first result of practicing the eightfold way is the\nweakening and disappearance of the error that the body is itself important.\nAll the\n\np. 130\n\neight efforts lead one to be intent upon the life-side of living. It is not a\nmere intellectual discovery or piece of psychic science which is proposed\nhere. The man will instinctively stop placing bodily interest first in his\nthoughts. Pleasures and pride in body and personal qualities will be replaced\nby the eight general life interests. The _second_ fetter to go is uncertainty\nor doubt about this path. The life proves its value as it goes along and great\nconfidence or faith arises from this knowledge and experience. _Third_ comes\nthe cessation of dependence upon outward forms or rules or ceremonies. It is\nthe _life_ that will speak in this man on all occasions. On life he will\ndepend, and to life he will respond with life. His action will then face the\nproblems which arise, and will be full of both love and thought. Outer rules\nand forms are for those who are not on this path.\n\nThen fade away the two terrible "fetters" which hold back the ordinary man\nfrom almost any semblance of true living: ignorant likes and dislikes\xc2\x97one\nshould say more than this, passionately ignorant likes and dislikes, producing\nan inflexibility of mind and living which in most cases borders on the\npsychopathic. Doctors are acquainted with the fact that many people go about\nin wheel chairs; not because of inability to walk, but inability to think they\ncan; here we have masses of inabilities and dependencies\n\np. 131\n\namong mankind, including negativeness and fears. But the grip of fixed likings\nand dislikings loosens its hold on those who are treading the Noble Eightfold\nPath, and they become ready to meet everything appreciatively according to its\nnature. All their troubles are then real or material ones; they have ceased\nmaking psychological ones in addition\xc2\x97psychological troubles such as\ndiscontent, envy, jealousy, resentment, malice, anxiety, worry, impatience,\nirritability, etc., which do no good, and only hinder the use of the powers of\nthe life in their dealing with the real troubles.\n\nWhen these five fetters lie in the dust, as the poet puts it, there are still\nfive more. This situation marks the half-way house of the upward Path. The man\nis now called an Arhat, a word which means "ready" or "qualified." He now\nknows what he wants and he is competent to go after it. In a secondary meaning\nhe is worthy, admirable, deserving. The five remaining fetters are:\n\n6\\. Desire for life in form.\n\n7\\. Desire for formless life.\n\n8\\. Pride.\n\n9\\. Self-love.\n\n10\\. Ignorance.\n\nIt would not be fitting here to attempt to say what this final ignorance is,\nexcept negatively\xc2\x97it is the\n\np. 132\n\nconception of oneself as anything conceivable. Perhaps we had better leave it\nat that, for it is fundamental in Buddha\'s thought, as in that of Krishna,\nShankar\xc4\x81ch\xc4\x81rya, Jesus and all great _gurus_ or teachers, that our final union\nis with something Beyond\xc2\x97beyond the limitations of mind, thought, feelings and\nthe will, all these, as well as bodily things, being limitations. Buddha more\nthan all others impressed this thought constantly upon his hearers, and\nemphasized the use of the word _nirv \xc4\x81na_\xc2\x97which means "to extinguish" as, for\nexample, the blowing out of a candle. But this includes even the extinction of\nextinction. In Edwin Arnold\'s words:\n\n       Seeking nothing, he gains all;  \n  Foregoing self, the Universe grows "I";  \nIf any teach Nirv\xc4\x81na is to cease,  \n  Say unto such they lie.\n\nIf any teach Nirv\xc4\x81na is to live,  \n  Say unto such they err; not knowing this,  \nNor what light shines beyond their broken lamps,  \n  Nor lifeless, timeless, bliss.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter Eight.
