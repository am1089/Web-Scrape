If he desires to generate male children, let him seize her thumb; if he desires (to generate) female children, her other fingers; if he desires (to generate) both (male and female children), let him seize the thumb together with the other fingers, (so as to seize the hand) up to the hairs (on the hair-side of the hand).\n\n(He should do so with the two Mantras),\n\n\'Sarasvati! Promote this (our undertaking), O gracious one, rich in studs,\nthou whom we sing first of all that is.\n\n\'I seize thy hand that we may be blessed with offspring, that thou mayst live\nto old age with me, thy husband. Bhaga, Aryaman, Savit _ri_ , Purandhi, the\ngods have given thee to me that we may rule our house.\'\n\n2. 2 He makes her turn round, from left to right, so that she faces the west, and recites over her (the following texts),\n\n\'With no evil eye, not bringing death to thy husband, bring luck to the\ncattle, be full of joy and\n\np. 190\n\nvigour. Give birth to living children, give birth to heroes, be friendly.\nBring us luck, to men and animals.\n\n\'Thus, Pushan, lead her to us, the highly blessed one, into whom men pour\nforth their sperm, ya na uru u _s_ ati visrayatai (read, vi _s_ rayatai),\nyasyam u _s_ anta _h_ praharema _s_ epam.\n\n\'Soma has acquired thee first (as his wife); after him the Gandharva has\nacquired thee. Thy third husband is Agni; the fourth am I, thy human husband.\n\n\'Soma has given her to the Gandharva; the Gandharva has given her to Agni.\nAgni gives me cattle and children, and thee besides.\n\n\'This am I, that art thou; the heaven I, the earth thou; the Saman I, the _Ri_\n_k_ thou. Come! Let us join together. Let us unite our sperm that we may\ngenerate a male child, a son, for the sake of the increase of wealth, of\nblessed offspring, of strength.\n\n\'Bountiful Indra, bless this woman with sons and with a happy lot. Give her\nten sons; let her husband be the eleventh.\'\n\n3. 3 After he has made her sit down in her proper place (see Sutra 5 of the preceding section), and has sprinkled \xc3\x82 _g_ ya into her joined hands, he twice pours fried grain into them, with (the verse), \'This grain I pour (into thy hands): may it bring prosperity to me, and may it unite thee (with me). May this Agni grant us that.\'\n\np. 191\n\n4\\. After he has sprinkled (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) over (the grain in her hands), he\nsacrifices (the grain) with her joined hands (which he seizes), with (the\nverse), \'This woman, strewing grain into the fire, prays thus, "May my husband\nlive long; may my relations be prosperous. Svaha!"\'\n\n5. 5 Having made her rise with (the verse which she recites), \'Up! with life\' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. I, 2, 8, 1), and having circumambulated the fire (with her) so that their right sides are turned towards it, with (the verse), \'May we find our way with thee through all hostile powers, as through streams of water\'\xc2\x97he pours fried grain (into her hands, and sacrifices them), as before.\n\n6\\. Having circumambulated (the fire) a second time, he pours fried grain\n(into her hands, and sacrifices them), as before.\n\n7\\. Having circumambulated (the fire) a third time, he sacrifices to (Agni)\nSvish _t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n8. 8 Here some add as subordinate oblations the _G_ aya, Abhyatana, and Rash _t_ rabh _ri_ t (oblations) as above.\n\n9. 9 To the west of the fire he makes her step forward in an easterly or a northerly direction the (seven) \'steps of Vish _n_ u.\'\n\n10\\. He says to her, \'Step forward with the right (foot) and follow with the\nleft. Do not put the left (foot) before the right.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[189:1](sbe30063.htm#fr_614) 20, 1. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 13, 2; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana I,\n7, 3 seq., &c.
