Vyasa said :-- Hearing the death news of Durmukha, Mahisa _s_ ura became\nblind with anger and began to utter repeatedly to the Danavas, \xc2\x93O! What is\nthis? What is this? Alas! That delicate woman has slain in battle the two\nheroes Durmukha and Vaskala! Lo! Now look at the wonderful workings of the\nDaiva (Fate). It is the acts virtuous, or otherwise that make men dependent;\nand the powerful Time awards pleasure or pain accordingly. The two powerful\nDemons are killed; what are we to do hereafter? You all judge and say what is\nreasonable at this critical juncture.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n5-23. Vyasa said :-- When the powerful Mahi _s_ a said thus, his general Chik\n_s_ ura, the great warrior spoke as follows :-- \xc2\x93O King! Why are you so\nanxious as to take away the life of a delicate woman? I will kill Her;\xc2\x94 thus\nsaying he departed for battle, mounted on his chariot and accompanied by his\nown army. The powerful Tamra accompanied him as his attendant; the sky and all\nthe quarters became filled with the clamour of their vast army. The auspicious\nDevi Bhagavati saw them before Her and She made an extraordinary wonderful\nsound with Her conchshell, with Her bow string and with Her great bell. The\nAsuras heard that and trembled and fled, speaking amongst each other, \xc2\x93What is\nthis?\xc2\x94 The Chik _s_ urak _s_ a seeing them turning their backs, told them very\nangrily, \xc2\x93O Danavas! What fear has now overcome you? I will slay today this\nvain woman in the battle with arrows; so you should quit your fear and remain\nsteady in battle.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the Danava Chieftain Chik _s_ ura came\nfearlessly before the Devi with bows and arrows in his hands and, accompanied\nby his army, angrily spoke thus :-- \xc2\x93O Thou of large and broad eyes! Why are\nyou roaring to terrify the weak persons! O the Soft limbed One! I have heard\nall about your deeds but I am not a bit afraid of You. O One of beautiful\neyes! It is a matter of disgrace, rather sin, to kill a woman; knowing this my\nheart wants to pass over this act (does not like to do it, if my purpose be\nserved without it).\n\n\n\np. 401\n\n\n\nO Beautiful One! The women fight with their side glances and amorous gestures;\nbut I have never heard a woman like you coming to fight with arms and weapons.\nEven the delicate flowers, Malati, etc., cause pain on the bodies of beautiful\nwomen like you; so it is not advisable to fight against you with flowers even;\nwhat to speak of sharpened arrows! Fie on those who spend their lives\naccording to the K _s_ atriya Dharma! Oh! Who can praise that Dharma which\nallows this dear body of ours to be pierced by sharpened arrows? This dear\nbody is nourished by sweet food, by being smeared with oil, and by smelling\nthe scents of beautiful flowers. Ought, then, one to destroy it by arrows from\nan enemy? Men get their bodies pierced by arrows and then become rich. Now is\nit possible for the riches to give pleasure afterwards when they caused such\npains in the beginning? Even if this be so, fie on those riches! O Beautiful\nOne! It seems you are not intelligent; why have you desired to fight instead\nof to enjoy sexual pleasures. O beautiful! What merits have you found in the\nbattle that you have chosen this. Where you see the action of the axes and\nspears, striking each other with clubs, and hurling of sharpened arrows and\nweapons and where, when death comes, jackals come and feed upon the dead\nbodies, what merits have you been able to trace out in these things! It is\nonly those cunning poets that praise these; they say that those who die in\nbattle go to heaven! O Beautiful! Those sayings are, no doubt, mere\nflatteries. Therefore, O Excellent One! Go away anywhere else you like; or\naccept this king Mahi _s_ a, the tormentor of the Devas, as your husband.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n24-30. Vyasa said :-- O King! The Danava Chik _s_ ura speaking thus, the\nDivine Mother addressed him thus :-- O Stupid! Why are you speaking false\nwords, having no significance, like a literary man giving out mere words only?\nYou do not know anything of politics, ethics, metaphysics; you serve the\nilliterate and stupid; therefore, you are also a first class illiterate; you\ndo not know what are the royal duties; then what are you speaking before me? I\nwill kill that Mahi _s_ asura in battle make the soil muddy with his blood,\nthus establish firmly My pillar of Fame and then go happily to My abode.\nSurely will I slay that vain vicious demon, the tormentor of the Devas. Better\nfight steadily. O Stupid! Better go to Patala with all the Danavas, if you and\nMahi _s_ a desire to live any longer. And if you like to go unto death, then\nbe ready and fight without any delay; I will slay you all; this is My firm\nresolve.\n\n\n\n31-39. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing the Devi\xc2\x92s words, the Danava, proud of\nhis own strength, began to hurl instantly on Her showers of arrows, as if\nanother shower of rain burst upon Her. The Devi cut off those arrows\n\n\n\np. 402\n\n\n\ninto pieces by Her sharp arrows and shot at him dreadful arrows like poisonous\nsnakes. Then their fight became astounding to the public; the Divine Mother,\nthen, struck him with Her club so much that he fell down from his chariot.\nThat vicious demon, thus struck by the club, remained senseless near to his\nchariot for two muhurtas, fixed like a mountain. Tamra, the tormentor of the\nfoes, seeing him thus, could not remain steady and came forward to fight with\nCha _nd_ ika. The Devi seeing him laughed and said, \xc2\x93O Danava! Come, Come, I\nwill instantly send you unto death. Or, what is the use of your coming? You\nare so weak that you can be called lifeless. What is that stupid Mahi _s_ a\ndoing now? Is he thinking out the way to save his life? You all are too weak;\nno use in killing you, all my labours will go in vain, if that wicked Mahi _s_\na, the enemy of the gods, be not slain. Therefore, do you go to your home and\nsend here your king Mahi _s_ a. I am staying here in that form in which that\nwicked one likes very much to see Me.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n40-56. Hearing Her words, Tamra became very angry and drawing his bow up to\nhis ear, began to hurl arrows after arrows on Cha _nd_ ika Devi. The\nBhagavati, too, had her eyes reddened with anger and drawing Her bow began to\nshoot arrows quickly at the demon, wishing to kill, as early as possible, the\nenemy of the gods. In the meanwhile, Chik _s_ ura regained his senses, and\ntaking up again his bow in an instant, came before the Devi. Then Chik _s_ ura\nand Tamra, the two valiant warriors, began to fight dreadfully with the Devi.\nMaha Maya then, became very angry and began to hurl arrows after arrows so\nincessantly that all the armours of all the Danavas became pierced and were\ncut down to pieces. The Asuras, thus pierced by arrows, became infuriated with\nanger and hurled angrily a network of arrows upon the Devi. The Danavas, thus\nstruck with sharp arrows and filled with cuts and wounds looked like the red\nKims\xc2\x92uka flowers in the spring. The fight then grew so severe between Tamra\nand Bhagavati that the seers, the Devas, were all struck with wonder. Tamra\nstruck on the head of the lion with his dreadful hard Mu _s_ ala (club), made\nof iron, and laughed and shouted aloud. Seeing him thus vociferating, the Devi\nbecame angry and cut off his head by her sharp axes in no time. The head being\nthus severed from the body, Tamra, though headless, for a moment turned round\nhis Mu _s_ ala and then fell down on the ground. The powerful Chik _s_ ura,\nseeing Tamra thus falling down, instantly took up his axe and ran after Cha\n_nd_ ika. Seeing Chik _s_ ura with axe in his hand, the Bhagavati quickly shot\nat him five arrows. With one arrow, his axe was cut down, with the second\narrow his hands were cut and with the remaining ones his head was severed from\nhis body. Thus when the two cruel warriors were slain, their soldiers soon\nfled\n\n\n\np. 403\n\n\n\naway in terror in all directions. The Devas were exceedingly glad at their\ndownfall and showered gladly flowers from the sky and uttered shouts of\nVictory to the Devi. The Ri _s_ is, Gandarbhas, the Vetalas, the Siddhas and\nChara _n_ as were all very glad and began to utter repeated, \xc2\x93O Goddess!\nVictory, victory be Yours.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Fourteenth Chapter of the Fifth Skandha on the killing of Tamra\nand Chik _s_ ura in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 15](bk05ch15.htm)\n\n'
