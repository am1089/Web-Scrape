He had great skill in taming steeds; he was a peerless\narcher, and was devoted to truth. Nala commanded a mighty army: like to the\nsun was his splendour, and he was exalted over all other kings as is the\nmonarch of the gods. He had withal great piety, and he was deeply read in the\nVedas, but he was ever a passionate lover of dice. Many a high-born lady spoke\nhis praises, for he was generous of heart, and self-controlled, and the\nguardian of law. Indeed, Nala was a very present Manu. 2\n\nNow there ruled over the neighbouring state of Vidarbha the mighty rajah\nBhima, the terrible in strength, who was likewise of choicest virtues. He was\nchildless, and he yearned for children. For long he had been wont to perform\nmany holy deeds intent upon offspring, but\n\np. 329\n\nwithout avail. 1 It chanced, however, that one day there came to his court a\nBrahman named Damana, and hospitable welcome was accorded him by the child-\ndesiring Bhima, for the seer was feasted in the hall with the rajah and his\nroyal consort. Thereafter a boon was conferred upon the queen: she became the\nmother of one sweet girl, the pearl of maidens, who was named Damayanti, and\nof three noble sons, Dama, Danta, and the renowned Dam\xc2\xb4ana, who all grew great\nand powerful.\n\nWhen fair Damayanti had attained the full bloom of her beauty, she was\nunequalled throughout the world for her brilliance and for her grace. Upon the\nfaultless and slender-waisted maiden there waited, as about Indra\'s queen, a\nhundred female slaves and a hundred virgin handmaids, and she shone among\nthem, decked with jewels and rich ornaments, like to the goddess of beauty,\nunrivalled and without a peer. Never among the gods, or the Yakshas, or among\nmortal men was a maiden more fair ever heard of or ever beheld than soul-\ndisturbing Damayanti, who disturbed the souls of the gods.\n\nIn presence of Bhima\'s sweet daughter the high-born ladies of Vidarbha took\njoy in constantly praising Nala, that tiger among rajahs. Likewise before\nNishadha\'s king was Damayanti ever extolled because of her beauty. So it fell\nthat, hearing much of each other\'s virtues, the silent passion of love was\nnurtured in both their hearts.\n\nImpatient grew Nala as his love increased, and he was wont to wander in a\ngrove within his palace garden musing secretly upon the maiden of faultless\nform. One day he saw disporting in the grounds a flock of beautiful swans with\nwings all flecked with gold. The rajah crept\n\np. 330\n\nforward softly and seized one, and much he marvelled to hear it cry out in\nhuman language.\n\n"Slay me not, O gentle king, and to thee I will render a service, for I will\npraise thee in the presence of Damayanti so that ever after she shall think of\nno other mortal man but thee."\n\nImmediately Nala set the bird at liberty, and it flew away rejoicing with its\nbright companions towards Vidarbha. When they reached the ladies\' garden of\nBhima\'s palace they settled down at the feet of Damayanti, who was reposing in\nthe shade with her virgin handmaids. All the fair young women gazed in wonder\non the swans, admiring their graceful forms and their plumage gleaming with\ngold, and ere long they began to pursue them among the trees. Then of a sudden\nthe bird which Damayanti followed spoke to her in human language and said:\n\n"Damayanti, hear! The noble king Nala dwells in Nishadha. Comely is he as a\ngod, nor can his equal be found in the world. Thou art the pearl of women, and\nhe is the pride of men. If thou wert wed to him, then would perfect beauty and\nnoble birth be united. Blessed indeed would be the union of the peerless with\nthe peerless."\n\nWondering, the maiden listened while the bird conversed thus strangely, and\nthen she said: "Speak also unto Nala in this manner."\n\nThe swan made answer: "So be it," and thereupon took flight with the others to\nNishadha, where it related unto Nala all that had taken place.\n\nEver after that day Damayanti ceased to live for herself alone; all her\nthoughts were given up to Nala. She desired most to sit apart in silent\nreverie; the bloom faded from her cheeks, and she grew dejected and\nmelancholy. Indeed, the maiden yielded up her soul to sorrow,\n\n\n\n[![DAMAYANTI AND THE SWAN<br> From the painting by Warwick\nGoble](tn/33000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/33000.jpg)  \nDAMAYANTI AND THE SWAN  \nFrom the painting by Warwick Goble  \n\n\n\np. 331\n\nand much she sighed in secret, gazing upward and meditating, for love had\ntaken possession of her heart; nor did she find pleasure in sleep, or in\ngentle converse, or in merry banquets. In the midst of her broken slumbers she\nwas wont to weep and cry out: "Oh, woe is me!"\n\nThe virgin handmaidens read her heart, and they went before her sire and told\nthat his gentle daughter was pining for the monarch among men. When Bhima\nheard this, he pondered deeply what should be done for Damayanti, and he\nperceived that her time for the swayamvara 1 had come. So he summoned all the\nhigh-born rajahs upon earth, saying: "O heroes of the world, come ye to the\nswayamvara."\n\nThen did the whole land resound with the trampling of elephants and horses and\nthe rumbling of chariots, for the stately princes, followed by their armies,\nswarmed towards the court of Bhima. By the strong lord of Vidarbha were they\nwelcomed with honour, and they sat upon their thrones.\n\nNow it happened that at this time these two wise sages, Narada and Parvata, 2\nascended Mount Meru to Swarga, the heaven of Indra, and they saluted the\nCloud-compeller within his palace. The immortal lord bade them welcome, and\nasked how it fared with the world. Narada said it fared well with the world\nand with all the mighty kings. Then Indra spake, saying: "Where are all the\nroyal heroes? Why do they not come hither as my honoured guests?" 3\n\nThe wise sage made answer and said: "O Cloud-compeller, the great rajahs\ncannot appear before thee\n\np. 332\n\nbecause even now they are hastening one and all to the swayamvara of\nDamayanti, the renowned daughter of Bhima, the fairest woman upon earth. O\nslayer of drought demons, every king seeks to woo this maid of transcending\nbeauty, for she is the pearl of all the world."\n\nAs Narada spake, the other gods drew nigh and listened to his stately\nutterance. Then together they exclaimed with rapture: "We also will go\nthither. . . ." In an instant they were hastening through the air in their\nchariots towards the city of Vidarbha to mingle with the wooers of Bhima\'s\nfair daughter.\n\nMeanwhile Nala had set forth with joy, his heart full of love for Damayanti.\nThe gods beheld him standing upon the surface of the earth with radiance like\nto the sun, and they arrested their course, gazing in mute wonder, for he was\nas comely as the god of love. Then, dropping down through the blue air, they\nhailed the stately hero, saying: "Do as we now beseech thee, O most excellent\nof princes; be thou the bearer of our message."\n\nNala adored the gods with folded hands and promised to obey their will, saying\nhumbly: "Who are ye that now command my service?"\n\nIndra spoke and said: "Lo! we are the dread guardians of the world. I am\nIndra, lord of heaven; you is Agni, god of fire; here is Varuna, king of the\nwaters; and there is Yama, lord of the dead. 1 Thou must inform Damayanti that\nwe have come to woo her and say to her: \' _Choose for thine husband one of the\ncelestial beings_ \'."\n\nNala made answer with folded hands, saying: "Send me not, I entreat thee, upon\nthis mission. How can I who am enamoured with the maiden, plead aright the\ncause\n\np. 333\n\nof another. In mercy spare me, ye gods--spare me this unwelcome service."\n\nBut the gods would not be moved from their purpose. They reminded Nala he had\nalready promised to do their will, and they therefore urged him to set forth\nwithout delay lest he should belie his words.\n\nThen the lord of Nishadha pleaded: "The palace of Bhima is strongly guarded,\nand I cannot enter there."\n\nIndra said: "Thou wilt indeed enter."\n\nAnd lo! even as the god spake, Nala found himself standing before Damayanti in\nher secret bower.\n\nThe beauteous maiden was surrounded by her virgin band, and he gazed upon her\nfaultless limbs and slender waist and into her entrancing eyes. Her shining\nbeauty excelled even the tender rays of the moon. The love of Nala grew deeper\nand stronger as he looked upon the smiling princess; but he curbed his\npassion, remembering his mission.\n\nAll the maidens gazed with wonder and joy at the noble form, and in their\nhearts they exclaimed: "Oh! the splendid one; oh! the strong and mighty hero--\nwho is he? . . . Is he god, or Yaksha, or Gandharva?" But they spoke not a\nword, for they were made bashfully silent by reason of his beauty.\n\nNala smiled upon Damayanti, and first she smiled softly in return; then she\nexclaimed in her wonder: "Who art thou that hast come hither like a celestial\nbeing to awaken all my love. Speak and tell, O sinless lord. How didst thou\ncontrive to enter the palace unseen, for surely all the chambers are strongly\nguarded by stern orders of the king?" 1\n\nThe rajah made answer, saying: "O thou fairest one, know now that I am even\nNala, and that I come hither as\n\np. 334\n\nthe messenger of the gods Indra and Agni, Varuna and Yama, and through their\npower have I entered here, unseen nor stayed, for it is their desire that I\nshould say unto thee: \' _Choose, O princess, for thine husband one of the\ncelestial beings_ \'. Such is the purpose of my mission from the great world\nguardians. Having heard me, thou mayst decide as thou wilt."\n\nDamayanti at once did homage to the gods. Then she smiled upon Nala and spoke,\nsaying: "Lo! I am thine already, and whatsoever I possess is thine also. O\ngive me thy love in return, Nala. For know that my heart\'s love was increased\nby the endearing words of the swan, and it is because of thee that the rajahs\nare all gathered here now. If thou wilt despise me, I will suffer death for\nthy sake by fire, or by water, or even by the noose 1."\n\nThe rajah made answer and said: "Wilt thou despise these, the gods, and choose\nfor thine husband a mortal who is more lowly than the dust they walk upon? Let\nthy heart aspire to them. Remember, too, that the man who incurs the anger of\nthe world\'s dread guardians will meet with certain death. From such a fate oh\nshield me, thou fairest one! . . . So choose one of the perfect gods, and thou\nshalt have robes unsullied by dust, garlands that never fade, and celestial\njoy without end."\n\nTrembling, and with tear-dimmed eyes, Damayanti said: "I do homage with due\nhumility to all the gods, but oh! I desire thee for my husband, thee and thee\nonly."\n\nBut Nala spake, saying: "I am charged with the mission of the celestial\nbeings, and cannot plead for myself now. But afterwards I will come to claim\nthee,\n\np. 335\n\nand will speak boldly, O bright one, so remember me in thine heart."\n\nThe maiden smiled through her tears. "Ah!" she said, "I see now a way of\nescape. . . . When thou comest to the swayamvara, enter thou together with the\ngods, and I will name thee as mine own, so that no sin may be charged against\nthee."\n\nThen Nala returned to the gods, who waited him eagerly, and he told them all\nthat the maiden had said, word for word. "In thy wisdom," he added, "thou wilt\njudge of what remains, O ye excelling gods."\n\nWhen at length the day of happy omen, the day of the swayamvara, arrived,\nBhima summoned at noontide all the love-sick rajahs, and they passed through\nthe court of golden columns and under the bright portal arch, and entered the\nHall of State like to lions on the mountains. The rajahs were then seated on\ntheir thrones, adorned with garlands and with dangling ear gems. The arms of\nsome were robust and powerful like the battle mace; those of others were\ndelicate and smooth as a serpent. With profuse and flowing hair, shapely\nnoses, and arching eyebrows, the faces of these great lords were radiant as\nthe stars in heaven. As a mountain cave is full of tigers, so was Bhima\'s\ngreat Hall full of rajah tigers on that day.\n\nWhen Damayanti entered in state, every eye and every soul was entranced by her\ndazzling beauty; all these lords of earth gazed upon her with unmoving eyes. .\n. . The name of each rajah was proclaimed in turn, and Nala, looking about\nher, was suddenly stricken with dismay, for she perceived that there were\npresent five Nalas who were undistinguishable in form and attire one from\nanother. The four gods who desired to win her had each assumed the likeness of\nher beloved one.\n\np. 336\n\n[paragraph continues] Whichsoever of these she gazed upon, he seemed to he her\nrajah, and in her secret heart she wailed: "How can I discern Nala among the\ncelestial beings?"\n\nIn her sore distress the trembling maiden folded her hands and did homage\nbefore the gods, to whom she prayed, saying:\n\n"When I heard the sweet words of the swans, I pledged my heart to Nala. I\nadjure thee by this truth, O ye gods. Oh! reveal my lord.\n\n"From my faith I have never swerved either by word or by deed. I adjure thee\nby this truth, O ye all-knowing Powers. Oh! reveal my lord.\n\n"The gods have destined that Nala should be mine husband. I adjure thee by\nthis truth. Oh! reveal my lord.\n\n"The vow which I so pledged to Nala is holy, and I must ever keep it. I adjure\nthee by this truth. Oh! reveal my lord.\n\n"O ye mighty ones, ye guardians of the world, assume now your forms divine, so\nthat I may know Nala, the monarch of men."\n\nThe gods heard the sad maiden\'s piteous prayer and marvelled greatly. They\nperceived that her resolve was firm, that she was constant in truth and in\nlove, and was holy and wise, and that she remained faithful to her lord. So\nthey revealed the tokens of their greatness. 1 . . . Then Damayanti was able\nto discern the four celestial beings because their skins were without moisture\nand their eyes never winked, there was no dust on their garlands and their\nfeet did not touch the earth.\n\n\n\n[![DAMAYANTI CHOOSING A HUSBAND<br> <i>From the painting by Warwick\nGoble</i>.](tn/33600.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/33600.jpg)  \nDAMAYANTI CHOOSING A HUSBAND  \n_From the painting by Warwick Goble_.  \n\n\n\np. 337\n\n[paragraph continues] She also knew Nala because he cast a shadow; there was\ndust on his raiment, and his garland was beginning to fade; drops of moisture\nstood on his skin, and his eyelids moved.\n\nGazing first upon the celestial beings and then upon him who was her heart\'s\ndesire, Damayanti named Nala as her lord. She modestly touched the hem of his\ngarment and threw round his neck a wreath of bright flowers, and thus chose\nhim for her husband.\n\nAll the rivals of Nala uttered cries of sorrow, but the gods and the sages\nexclaimed aloud: "Well done! Well done!" and honoured the lord of Nishadha.\n\nNala spake in his joy to fair Damayanti, saying: "Since thou, O maiden with\nserene smile, hast chosen me for thine husband in the presence of the gods,\nknow that I will be a faithful consort who will ever take delight in thy\nwords. I am thine, and so long as my life endures I will be thine only."\n\nSo did the lord of Nishadha pledge his faith, and the heart of the maiden was\nmade glad. The happy pair then did homage before the gods, and these\nresplendent guardians of the earth bestowed, in their joy, eight surpassing\ngifts upon Nala. Indra gave him power to behold the godhead in the sacrifice,\nand power to walk unhindered by any obstacle wheresoever he desired; Agni gave\nhim power over fire, and power over the three worlds; 1 Varuna gave him power\nover water, and power to obtain fresh garlands at will; and Yama gave him\nsubtle skill in preparing food, and eminence in every virtue. Each of the gods\nalso conferred his double blessing upon Nala, and thereafter they departed.\n\nAll the rajahs wondered greatly when they beheld the maiden\'s choice confirmed\nin this manner, and they\n\np. 338\n\nwent away as they came, with joy, and returned unto their own domains.\n\nBhima rejoiced greatly when the happy bridal was celebrated in pomp and with\nstate, and he bade Nala adieu with great courtesy when that great lord of\nNishadha, after fitting sojourn at Vidarbha, set out to return to his native\ncity with the pearl of women whom he had won.\n\nNow it chanced that when the gods had left the swayamvara they met in the\nmidst of the blue air Kali 1, the demon of evil, who was accompanied by the\nwicked spirit Dwapara. Indra, the slayer of giants, spoke and said: "Whither\nart thou going with Dwapara, O Kali?"\n\nKali made answer: "We are hastening to the swayamvara, for it is my desire to\nobtain Damayanti as my bride."\n\nSmiling, the king of gods spake, saying: "The bridal is now arranged and\nended, for to! the fair Damayanti has chosen Nala for her husband in our\npresence."\n\nWhen he heard these words, the heart of Kali was made angry, and he exclaimed:\n"Since she has preferred a mortal in presence of the celestial beings, let her\nchoice be her own doom."\n\nBut the gods said: "Know thou that our consent was freely given, because\nDamayanti has chosen for herself a husband endowed with all the virtues, and\nequal even to the guardians of the world. If anyone should chance to curse\nNala, the curse will recoil fatally, and the curser will be cast into the\ntorments of the dark lake of hell." Having spoken thus, the bright deities\nascended the heavens.\n\nThen said Kali to Dwapara: "I cannot now control my fierce wrath. Lo! I will\nbe avenged upon Nala, for\n\np. 339\n\n[paragraph continues] I will enter his body, and he will be bereft of his\nkingdom and of his bride. Thou, Dwapara, wilt enter the dice and give me thine\naid."\n\nSo was a malignant compact arranged between the demon of evil and his darksome\nally, and together they went towards Nishadha to haunt the stately palace of\nNala, waiting for the fatal moment.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[328:1](iml25.htm#fr_292) The south-eastern division of Central India.\n\n[328:2](iml25.htm#fr_293) An incarnation of Manu, the first lawgiver.\n\n[329:1](iml25.htm#fr_294) It was a religious necessity to have offspring.
