On the day of preparation he\nseizes the victim for Agni\n\np. 69\n\nand Soma. Having performed the offering of the omentum thereof; he prepares a\ncake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma 1. Thereupon the offerings of the\nDivine Quickeners (Devasu) are prepared.\n\n5:3:3:22\\. For Savit _ri_ Satyaprasava (of true impulse) he prepares a cake\nfrom fast-grown (pla _s_ uka) rice 2, on either twelve, or eight, potsherds;\nfor Savit _ri_ is the impeller (prasavit _ri_ ) of the gods: 'May I be\nquickened 3, impelled by Savit _ri_!' thus (he thinks). And as to (its being)\nof fast-grown rice: 'May they quickly impel me!' he thinks.\n\n5:3:3:33\\. For Agni G _ri_ hapati (the house-lord) he then prepares a cake on\neight potsherds from quick-grown (a _s_ u) rice 4; for the house-lord's\nposition means prosperity: as much as he (the king) rules over, over\n\np. 70\n\nthat Agni, the house-lord, leads him to hold the position of a master of the\nhouse. And as to its being of quick-grown rice: 'May they quickly lead me!' so\nhe thinks.\n\n5:3:3:44\\. For Soma Vanaspati (the wood-lord or tree) he then prepares a pap\nof _s_ yamaka millet: thereby Soma, the wood-lord, quickens him for the\nplants. And as to its being prepared of _s_ yamaka,--they, the _s_ yamakas\namong plants doubtless are most manifestly Soma's own: therefore it is\nprepared of _s_ yamaka grain.\n\n5:3:3:55\\. For B _ri_ haspati Va _k_  1 (speech) he then prepares a pap of\nwild rice: thereby B _ri_ haspati quickens him for speech. And as to its being\nprepared of wild rice,--B _ri_ haspati is the Brahman, and they, the wild\nrice-plants, are ripened by the Brahman 2: hence it is prepared of wild rice.\n\n5:3:3:66\\. For Indra _G_ yesh _th_ a (the most excellent) he then prepares a\npap of red rice-grains (hayana) 3: thereby Indra, the most excellent, leads\nhim to excellence (or, lordship). And as to its being prepared of red rice:\noutstanding doubtless are those plants, the red rice, and outstanding is\nIndra: therefore it is prepared of red rice.\n\n5:3:3:77\\. For Rudra Pa _s_ upati (lord of beasts) he then prepares a Raudra\npap of gavedhuka seeds (coix barbata): thereby Rudra, the lord of beasts,\nquickens\n\np. 71\n\nhim for cattle. And as to its being prepared of gavedhuka seed;--that God is\n(the recipient of) refuse (remains of offering), and gavedhuka seeds are\nrefuse: therefore it is (prepared) of gavedhuka seed.\n\n5:3:3:88\\. For Mitra Satya (the True) he then prepares a pap of Namba 1 seed:\nthereby Mitra the True quickens him for the Brahman. And as to its being\nprepared of Namba seed,--to Varu _n_ a, no doubt, belong those plants which\ngrow in ploughed ground; but those, the Namba plants, belong to Mitra:\ntherefore it is (prepared) of Namba seed.\n\n5:3:3:99\\. For Varu _n_ a Dharmapati (the lord of the law) he then prepares a\nVaru _n_ a pap of barley: thereby Varu _n_ a, the lord of the law, makes him\nlord of the law; and that truly is the supreme state, when one is lord of the\nlaw; for whosoever attains to the supreme state, to him they come in (matters\nof) law: therefore to Varu _n_ a Dharmapati.\n\n5:3:3:1010\\. He then proceeds with the cake for Agni-Soma. The Svish _t_ ak\n_ri_ t of that (oblation) remains yet unoffered, when he proceeds with those\n(other) oblations.\n\n5:3:3:1111\\. Thereupon, taking hold of him (the Sacrificer) by the right arm,\nhe mutters (Va _g_. S. IX, 39, 40), 'May Savit _ri_ quicken thee for (powers\nof) quickening (ruling) 2, Agni for householders, Soma for trees, B _ri_\nhaspati for speech, Indra for lordship, Rudra for cattle, Mitra for truth,\nVaru _n_ a for the lord of the law.'\n\n5:3:3:1212\\. 'Quicken him, O gods, to be unrivalled!'\n\np. 72\n\n[paragraph continues] \\--he thereby says, 'Quicken him, O gods, so as to be\nwithout an enemy; for great chiefdom, for great lordship!' in this there is\nnothing obscure;--'for man-rule!' 'for the ruling of men,' he thereby\nsays;--'for Indra's energy!' 'for vigour' he means to say when he says, 'for\nIndra's energy;'--'him, the son of such and such (a man), the son of such and\nsuch (a woman),'--whatever be his parentage, with reference to that he says\nthis;--'of such and such a people,' that is to say, of the people whose king\nhe is;--'this man, O ye (people) 1, is your king, Soma is the king of us\nBrahmans!' He thereby causes everything here to be food for him (the king);\nthe Brahman alone he excepts: therefore the Brahman is not to be fed upon, for\nhe has Soma for his king.\n\n5:3:3:1313\\. Now those gods have the power of quickening, whence their name\n'devasu' (Divine Quickeners). It is those gods who now quicken him thus, and\nquickened (consecrated) by them he will be consecrated on the morrow.\n\n5:3:3:1414\\. They are double-named, for a coupling means strength: 'May the\nstrong quicken (him),' thus he thinks, and therefore they are double-named.\n\n5:3:3:1515\\. He now says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish _t_\nak _ri_ t.' And as to why that ceremony is performed here between two\nofferings 2,--verily Pra _g_ apati is that sacrifice which is here performed,\nand from which all these creatures were produced,--\n\np. 73\n\nand so they are even now produced after this one. Thus he places him (the\nSacrificer) in the very middle of that Pra _g_ apati, and quickens him in the\nmiddle: this is why that ceremony is performed between two offerings. Having\ncalled for the _S_ rausha _t_. he says, 'Urge for Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t!'\nand offers as the Vasha _t_ is pronounced.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[68:1](sbe4114.htm#fr_143) That is, by the steam rising from the B _ri_\nhaspati pap in the bottom vessel.\n\n[68:2](sbe4115.htm#fr_144) The Abhishe _k_ aniya (or Abhisheka, literally 'the\nsprinkling'), the Consecration ceremony (corresponding to the Anointment of\nmodern times), requires for its performance five days, viz. one diksha\n(initiation ceremony), three upasads, and one sutya or Soma-day, the\nparticular form of Soma-sacrifice being the Ukthya (part ii, p. 325, note 2).\nThe Diksha is performed immediately after the expiration of the dark fortnight\nfollowing the full-moon of Phalguni, that is to say, on the first day of _K_\naitra (about the middle of March).--According to Katy. XV, 3, 47 both the\nAbhishe _k_ aniya and Da _s_ apeya require special offering-places, the latter\nbeing north of the former. Cf. note on [V, 4, 5, 13](sbe4122.htm#5:4:5:13).--\nAs regards p. 69 the chants (stotra) of the Consecration ceremony, the\nPavamana-stotras are chanted in the thirty-twofold, the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya-stotras in\nthe fifteenfold, the P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotras in the seventeenfold, and the\nAgnish _t_ oma-saman and Uktha-stotras in the twenty-onefold mode of chanting\n(stoma). Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_. Br, 18, 10, 9. The Bahishpavamana is specially\nconstructed so as to consist of the following parts,--Sama-veda II, 978-80;\nfurther six so-called sambharya verses further II, 125-27; II, 4-6; II, 431-3;\nII, 128-30; II, 555-59; II, 7-9; II, 981-83; see Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_. Br. 18, 8, 7 seq.\n--The Taittiriya ritual (Taitt. Br. I, 8, 7 seq.), on the other hand,\nprescribes for the Pavamana-stotras, the thirty-four-versed stoma, commencing\nthe Bahishpavamana by II, 920; II, 431, &c.\n\n[69:1](sbe4115.htm#fr_145) This is the ordinary Pa _s_ u-puroda _s_ a, or cake\nof animal (offering). See part ii, p. 199, note 2 (where read Agni and Soma.\ninstead of Indra and Agni).\n\n[69:2](sbe4115.htm#fr_146) That is, according to Saya _n_ a, rice which has\nsprung up again and ripens very rapidly. Taitt. S. I, 8, 10 has 'a _s_ u'\ninstead, for which see [next paragraph](sbe4115.htm#5:3:3:4).\n\n[69:3](sbe4115.htm#fr_147) Or, consecrated (su).\n\n[69:4](sbe4115.htm#fr_148) That is, according to Saya _n_ a, rice ripening in\nsixty days. The Taitt. S. prescribes a cake of black rice for Agni.\n\n[70:1](sbe4115.htm#fr_149) B _ri_ haspati Vakpati (lord of speech), according\nto the Black Ya _g_ us, where the order of the 'Divine Quickeners' is moreover\nsomewhat different.\n\n[70:2](sbe4115.htm#fr_150) ? Or cooked by the Brahman, that is by Brahmans,\nwhen living the life of hermits or ascetics.\n\n[70:3](sbe4115.htm#fr_151) The Taitt. S. prescribes a cake prepared of large\nrice (mahavrihi).\n\n[71:1](sbe4115.htm#fr_152) The Taitt. S. and Br. read 'amba' instead, 'a kind\nof grain,' according to Saya _n_ a.\n\n[71:2](sbe4115.htm#fr_153) Or, perhaps, 'on the part of the quickeners\n(rulers, savanam).'\n\n[72:1](sbe4115.htm#fr_154) Here the name of the people, e. g. 'O ye Kurus, O\nye Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas!' is inserted. The Taitt. S. reads, 'O ye Bharata _h_.'\n\n[72:2](sbe4115.htm#fr_155) That is to say, the oblations to the 'Divine\nQuickeners,' which were inserted between the chief oblation of the\n(Agnishomiya) pa _s_ upuroda _s_ a and the Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t of it; see\nabove, [parag. 10](sbe4115.htm#5:3:3:10).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 3, 4.
