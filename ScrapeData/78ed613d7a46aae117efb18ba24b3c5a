Proof of\nwhat, we ask in reply, and to whom? If no definite answer can be given to\nthese two questions, consciousness cannot be defined as \'proof\'; for \'proof\'\nis a relative notion, like \'son.\' You will perhaps reply \'Proof to the Self\';\nand if we go on asking \'But what is that Self\'? you will say, \'Just\nconsciousness as already said by us before.\' True, we reply, you said so; but\nit certainly was not well said. For if it is the nature of consciousness to be\n\'proof\' (\'light,\' \'enlightenment\') on the part of a person with regard to\nsomething, how can this consciousness which is thus connected with the person\nand the thing be itself conscious of itself? To explain: the essential\ncharacter of consciousness or knowledge is that by its very existence it\nrenders things capable of becoming objects, to its own substrate, of thought\nand speech. This consciousness (anubhuti), which is also termed _g \xc3\xb1_ana,\navagati, sa _m_ vid, is a particular attribute belonging to a conscious Self\nand related to an object: as such it is known to every one on the testimony of\nhis own Self--as appears from ordinary judgments such as \'I know the jar,\' \'I\nunderstand this matter,\' \'I am conscious of (the presence of) this piece of\ncloth.\' That such is the essential nature of consciousness you yourself admit;\nfor you have proved thereby its self-luminousness. Of this consciousness which\nthus clearly presents itself as the attribute of an agent and as related to an\nobject, it would be difficult indeed to prove that at the same time it is\nitself the agent; as difficult as it would be to prove that the object of\naction is the agent.\n\nFor we clearly see that this agent (the subject of consciousness) is permanent\n(constant), while its attribute, i. e. consciousness, not differing herein\nfrom joy, grief, and the like, rises, persists for some time, and then comes\nto an end. The permanency of the conscious subject is proved by the fact of\nrecognition, \'This very same thing was formerly apprehended by me.\' The non-\npermanency of consciousness,\n\np. 57\n\non the other hand, is proved by thought expressing itself in the following\nforms, \'I know at present,\' \'I knew at a time,\' \'I, the knowing subject, no\nlonger have knowledge of this thing.\' How then should consciousness and (the\nconscious subject be one? If consciousness which changes every moment were\nadmitted to constitute the conscious subject, it would be impossible for us to\nrecognise the thing seen to-day as the one we saw yesterday; for what has been\nperceived by one cannot be recognised by another. And even if consciousness\nwere identified with the conscious subject and acknowledged as permanent, this\nwould no better account for the fact of recognition. For recognition implies a\nconscious subject persisting from the earlier to the later moment, and not\nmerely consciousness. Its expression is \'I myself perceived this thing on a\nformer occasion.\' According to your view the quality of being a conscious\nagent cannot at all belong to consciousness; for consciousness, you say, is\njust consciousness and nothing more. And that there exists a pure\nconsciousness devoid of substrate and objects alike, we have already refuted\non the ground that of a thing of this kind we have absolutely no knowledge.\nAnd that the consciousness admitted by both of us should be the Self is\nrefuted by immediate consciousness itself. And we have also refuted the\nfallacious arguments brought forward to prove that mere consciousness is the\nonly reality.--But, another objection is raised, should the relation of the\nSelf and the \'I\' not rather be conceived as follows:--In self-consciousness\nwhich expresses itself in the judgment \'I know,\' that intelligent something\nwhich constitutes the absolutely non-objective element, and is pure\nhomogeneous light, is the Self; the objective element (yushmad-artha) on the\nother hand, which is established through its being illumined (revealed) by the\nSelf is the _I_ \\--in \'I know\'--and this is something different from pure\nintelligence, something objective or external?\n\nBy no means, we reply; for this view contradicts the relation of attribute and\nsubstrate of attribute of which we are directly conscious, as implied in the\nthought \'I know.\'\n\np. 58\n\nConsider also what follows.--\'If the _I_ were not the Self, the inwardness of\nthe Self would not exist; for it is just the consciousness of the _I_ which\nseparates the inward from the outward.\n\n\'"May I, freeing myself from all pain, enter on free possession of endless\ndelight?" This is the thought which prompts the man desirous of release to\napply himself to the study of the sacred texts. Were it a settled matter that\nrelease consists in the annihilation of the I, the same man would move away as\nsoon as release were only hinted at. "When I myself have perished, there still\npersists some consciousness different from me;" to bring this about nobody\ntruly will exert himself.\n\n\'Moreover the very existence of consciousness, its being a consciousness at\nall, and its being self-luminous, depend on its connexion with a Self; when\nthat connexion is dissolved, consciousness itself cannot be established, not\nany more than the act of cutting can take place when there is no person to cut\nand nothing to be cut. Hence it is certain that the I, i.e. the knowing\nsubject, is the inward Self.\'\n\nThis scripture confirms when saying \'By what should he know the knowcr?\' (B\n_ri_. Up. II, 4, 15); and Sm _ri_ ti also, \'Him who knows this they call the\nknower of the body\' (Bha. Gi. XIII, 1). And the Sutrakara also, in the section\nbeginning with \'Not the Self on account of scriptural statement\' (II, 3, 17),\nwill say \'For this very reason (it is) a knower\' (II, 3, 18); and from this it\nfollows that the Self is not mere consciousness.\n\nWhat is established by consciousness of the \'I\' is the I itself, while the\nnot-I is given in the consciousness of the not-I; hence to say that the\nknowing subject, which is established by the state of consciousness, \'I know,\'\nis the not-I, is no better than to maintain that one\'s own mother is a barren\nwoman. Nor can it be said that this \'I,\' the knowing subject, is dependent on\nits light for something else. It rather is self-luminous; for to be self-\nluminous means to have consciousness for one\'s essential nature. And that\nwhich has light for its essential nature does not depend for its light on\nsomething else. The case is\n\np. 59\n\nanalogous to that of the flame of a lamp or candle. From the circumstance that\nthe lamp illumines with its light other things, it does not follow either that\nit is not luminous, or that its luminousness depends on something else; the\nfact rather is that the lamp being of luminous nature shines itself and\nillumines with its light other things also. To explain.--The one substance te\n_g_ as, i.e. fire or heat, subsists in a double form, viz. as light (prabha),\nand as luminous matter. Although light is a quality of luminous substantial\nthings, it is in itself nothing but the substance te _g_ as, not a mere\nquality like e.g. whiteness; for it exists also apart from its substrates, and\npossesses colour (which is a quality). Having thus attributes different from\nthose of qualities such as whiteness and so on, and possessing illumining\npower, it is the substance te _g_ as, not anything else (e.g. a quality).\nIllumining power belongs to it, because it lights up itself and other things.\nAt the same time it is practically treated as a quality because it always has\nthe substance te _g_ as for its substrate, and depends on it. This must not be\nobjected to on the ground that what is called light is really nothing but\ndissolving particles of matter which proceed from the substance te _g_ as; for\nif this were so, shining gems and the sun would in the end consume themselves\ncompletely. Moreover, if the flame of a lamp consisted of dissolving particles\nof matter, it would never be apprehended as a whole; for no reason can be\nstated why those particles should regularly rise in an agglomerated form to\nthe height of four fingers breadth, and after that simultaneously disperse\nthemselves uniformly in all directions--upwards, sideways, and downwards. The\nfact is that the flame of the lamp together with its light is produced anew\nevery moment and again vanishes every moment; as we may infer from the\nsuccessive combination of sufficient causes (viz. particles of oil and wick)\nand from its coming to an end when those causes are completely consumed.\n\nAnalogously to the lamp, the Self is essentially intelligent ( _k_ id-rupa),\nand has intelligence ( _k_ aitanya) for its quality. And to be essentially\nintelligent means to be\n\np. 60\n\nself-luminous. There are many scriptural texts declaring this, compare e.g.\n\'As a mass of salt has neither inside nor outside but is altogether a mass of\ntaste, thus indeed that Self has neither inside nor outside but is altogether\na mass of knowledge\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 13); \'There that person becomes self-\nluminous, there is no destruction of the knowing of the knower\' (B _ri_. Up.\nIV, 3, 14; 30); \'He who knows, let me smell this, he is the Self ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 12, 4); \'Who is that Self? That one who is made of knowledge, among the\npra _n_ as, within the heart, the light, the person\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 7);\n\'For it is he who sees, hears, smells, tastes, thinks, considers, acts, the\nperson whose Self is knowledge\' (Pr. Up. IV, 9); \'Whereby should one know the\nknower\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15). \'This person knows,\' \'The seer does not see\ndeath nor illness nor pain\' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 26, 2); \'That highest person not\nremembering this body into which he was born\' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 12, 3); \'Thus\nthese sixteen parts of the spectator that go towards the person; when they\nhave readied the person, sink into him\' (Pr. Up. VI, 5); \'From this consisting\nof mind, there is different an interior Self consisting of knowledge\' (Taitt.\nUp. II, 4). And the Sutrakara also will refer to the Self as a \'knower\' in II,\n3, 18. All which shows that the self-luminous Self is a knower, i.e. a knowing\nsubject, and not pure light (non-personal intelligence). In general we may say\nthat where there is light it must belong to something, as shown by the light\nof a lamp. The Self thus cannot be mere consciousness. The grammarians\nmoreover tell us that words such as \'consciousness,\' \'knowledge,\' &c., are\nrelative; neither ordinary nor Vedic language uses expressions such as \'he\nknows\' without reference to an object known and an agent who knows.\n\nWith reference to the assertion that consciousness constitutes the Self,\nbecause it (consciousness) is not non-intelligent ( _g_ ada), we ask what you\nunderstand by this absence of non-intelligence.\' If you reply \'luminousness\ndue to the being of the thing itself (i.e. of the thing which is a _g_ a _d_\na)\'; we point out that this definition would wrongly include lamps also, and\nsimilar things; and it would moreover\n\np. 61\n\ngive rise to a contradiction, since you do not admit light as an attribute,\ndifferent from consciousness itself. Nor can we allow you to define a _g_\nadatva as \'being of that nature that light is always present, without any\nexception,\' for this definition would extend also to pleasure, pain, and\nsimilar states. Should you maintain that pleasure and so on, although being\nthroughout of the nature of light, are non-intelligent for the reason that,\nlike jars, &c., they shine forth (appear) to something else and hence belong\nto the sphere of the not-Self; we ask in reply: Do you mean then to say that\nknowledge appears to itself? Knowledge no less than pleasure appears to some\none else, viz. the \'I\': there is, in that respect, no difference between the\njudgment \'I know,\' and the judgment \'I am pleased.\' Non-intelligence in the\nsense of appearingness-to-itself is thus not proved for consciousness; and\nhence it follows that what constitutes the Self is the non- _g_ ada \'I\' which\nis proved to itself by its very Being. That knowledge is of the nature of\nlight depends altogether on its connection with the knowing \'I\': it is due to\nthe latter, that knowledge, like pleasure, manifests itself to that conscious\nperson who is its substrate, and not to anybody else. The Self is thus not\nmere knowledge, but is the knowing \'I.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The view that the conscious subject is something unreal, due to the\nahamkara, cannot be maintained](sbe48022.htm)\n\n'
