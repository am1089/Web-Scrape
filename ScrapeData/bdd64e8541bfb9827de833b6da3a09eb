The king is master of all, with the exception of Brahma _n_ as. 1\n\n2\\. (He shall be) holy in acts and speech, 2\n\n3\\. Fully instructed in the threefold (sacred science) and in logic, 3\n\n4\\. Pure, of subdued senses, surrounded by companions 4\n\np. 235\n\npossessing excellent qualities and by the means (for upholding his rule).\n\n5\\. He shall be impartial towards his subjects; 5\n\n6\\. And he shall do (what is) good for them. 6\n\n7\\. All, excepting Brahma _n_ as, shall worship him who is seated on a higher\nseat, (while they them-selves sit on a) lower (one). 7\n\n8\\. The (Brahma _n_ as), also, shall honour him. 8\n\n9\\. He shall protect the castes and orders in accordance with justice; 9\n\n10\\. And those who leave (the path of) duty, he shall lead back (to it). 10\n\n11\\. For it is declared (in the Veda) that he obtains a share of the spiritual\nmerit (gained by his subjects). 11\n\n12\\. And he shall select as his domestic priest (purohita) a Brahma _n_ a who\nis learned (in the Vedas), of noble family, eloquent, handsome, of (a\nsuitable) age, and of a virtuous disposition, who lives righteously and who is\naustere. 12\n\np. 236\n\n13\\. With his assistance he shall fulfil his religious duties. 13\n\n14\\. For it is declared (in the Veda): 'Kshatriyas, who are assisted by Brahma\n_n_ as, prosper and do not fall into distress.' 14\n\n15\\. He shall, also, take heed of that which astrologers and interpreters of\nomens tell (him).\n\n16\\. For some (declare), that the acquisition of wealth and security depend\nalso upon that.\n\n17\\. He shall perform in the fire of the hall the rites ensuring prosperity\nwhich are connected with expiations ( _s_ anti), festivals, a prosperous\nmarch, long life, and auspiciousness; as well as those that are intended to\ncause enmity, to subdue (enemies), to destroy (them) by incantations, and to\ncause their misfortune. 17\n\n18\\. Officiating priests (shall perform) the other (sacrifices) according to\nthe precepts (of the Veda). 18\n\np. 237\n\n19\\. His administration of justice (shall be regulated by) the Veda, the\nInstitutes of the Sacred Law, the A\xe1\xb9\x85gas, and the Pura _n_ a. 19\n\n20\\. The laws of countries, castes, and families, which are not opposed to the\n(sacred) records, (have) also authority. 20\n\n21\\. Cultivators, traders, herdsmen, money-lenders, and artisans (have\nauthority to lay down rules) for their respective classes.\n\n22\\. Having learned the (state of) affairs from those who (in each class) have\nauthority (to speak he shall give) the legal decision. 22\n\n23\\. Reasoning is a means for arriving at the truth. 23\n\n24\\. Coming to a conclusion through that, he shall decide properly.\n\n25\\. If (the evidence) is conflicting, he shall learn (the truth) from (Brahma\n_n_ as) who are well versed in 25\n\np. 238\n\nthe threefold sacred lore, and give his decision (accordingly).\n\n26\\. For, (if he acts) thus, blessings will attend him (in this world and the\nnext). 26\n\n27\\. It has been declared in the Veda: 'Brahma _n_ as, united with Kshatriyas,\nuphold gods, manes, and men.\n\n28\\. They declare, that (the word) da _n_ _d_ a (rule or punishment) is\nderived from (the verb) damayati (he restrains); therefore he shall restrain\nthose who do not restrain themselves.\n\n29\\. (Men of) the (several) castes and orders who always live according to\ntheir duty enjoy after death the rewards of their works, and by virtue of a\nremnant of their (merit) they are born again in excellent countries, castes,\nand families, (endowed) with beauty, long life, learning in the Vedas,\n(virtuous) conduct, wealth, happiness, and wisdom. 29\n\n30\\. Those who act in a contrary manner perish, being born again in various\n(evil conditions). 30\n\n31\\. The advice of the spiritual teacher and the punishment (inflicted by the\nking) guard them. 31\n\n32\\. Therefore a king and a spiritual teacher must not be reviled. 32\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[234:1](sbe0275.htm#fr_1129) **XI**. Macnaghten, Mitakshara I, 1, 27; Manu IX,\n313-322; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 29, 60.\n\n[234:2](sbe0275.htm#fr_1130) Manu VII, 26. 'Holy in acts,' i.e. constantly\nacting in conformity with the _S_ astras; 'holy in speech,' i.e. when\nadministering justice he shall not speak partially.\n\n[234:3](sbe0275.htm#fr_1131) Manu VII, 43; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 310.\nHaradatta thinks that the term 'the threefold sacred science includes the\nfourth Veda also, because it consists chiefly of _Ri_ _k_ as and Ya _g_ us\nformulas.'\n\n[234:4](sbe0275.htm#fr_1132) Manu VII, 30-31; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 354;\n\xc3\x82pastamba III, 11, 27, 18. 'Of subdued senses, i.e. free from the (seven)\nvices p. 235 (common among kings), i.e. sensuality, gambling, hunting,\ndrinking, &c.'--Haradatta. The means (upaya) are those mentioned by Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya I, 345-346.\n\n[235:5](sbe0275.htm#fr_1133) Manu VII, 80; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 333.\n\n[235:6](sbe0275.htm#fr_1134) 'And he shall do what is good, i.e. dig tanks,\nbuild embankments and bridges &c. for them, i.e. his subjects.'--Haradatta.\n\n[235:7](sbe0275.htm#fr_1135) '(On a) lower (one), i.e. on the ground only.'--\nHaradatta. This is still the custom in native courts, where, however, Brahma\n_n_ as, as a rule, must also sit on the floor.\n\n[235:8](sbe0275.htm#fr_1136) 'Honour him,' i.e. worship him by invoking\nblessings on him and the like.\n\n[235:9](sbe0275.htm#fr_1137) Manu VII, 35.\n\n[235:10](sbe0275.htm#fr_1138) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 360.\n\n[235:11](sbe0275.htm#fr_1139) Manu VIII, 304; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 334.\n\n[235:12](sbe0275.htm#fr_1140) Manu VII, 78; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 312.\nHaradatta explains vaksampanna, 'eloquent,' by 'one who knows Sanskrit.'\nAccording to the same, 'the (suitable) age' is the prime of life, when men are\nneither too young nor too old. 'Austere' is interpreted to mean 'not given to\nsensual enjoyments.'\n\n[236:13](sbe0275.htm#fr_1141) Manu VII, 78.\n\n[236:14](sbe0275.htm#fr_1142) _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a IV, I, 4, 4-6.\n\n[236:17](sbe0275.htm#fr_1143) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 25, 4, 7. Santis,\n'expiations,' are rites intended to avert an impending misfortune which is\nannounced by an evil omen. 'Festivals' are, according to Haradatta, wedding-\ndays and the like; 'rites connected with auspiciousness' are, according to the\nsame, rites on entering a new dwelling and the like. Haradatta further remarks\nthat, though, according to the text, the king must perform these rites, he is,\nin reality, only to give the necessary orders, and to furnish the means for\ntheir performance, while the Purohita is to officiate as priest. He adds, that\nanother commentator asserts that 'the Purohita,' not 'the king,' must be taken\nas the subject of the sentence.\n\n[236:18](sbe0275.htm#fr_1144) Manu VII, 78-79; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 313.\nHaradatta says that by the 'other' sacrifices, both G _ri_ hya and _S_ rauta\nrites are meant. I think that the latter are chiefly intended, as the Sa _m_\nskaras are included under the rites of festive days, mentioned in the\npreceding Sutra.\n\n[237:19](sbe0275.htm#fr_1145) The A\xe1\xb9\x85gas, i.e. the six auxiliary branches of\nlearning mentioned above, VIII, 5. My best copy inserts 'the Upavedas' after\nthe A\xe1\xb9\x85gas. But the words upaveda _h_ and dharmasastra _n_ i, 'the institutes\nof law,' are probably interpolations. For the latter are already included by\nthe term A\xe1\xb9\x85ga, as part of the Kalpa.\n\n[237:20](sbe0275.htm#fr_1146) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 15, 1; Manu VII, 203; V111, 47,\n46; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 342. 'The (sacred) records, i.e. the Vedas and the\nrest.'--Haradatta.\n\n[237:22](sbe0275.htm#fr_1147) 'Having learned, i.e. having heard and\nconsidered, from them, i.e. from men of those classes, according to their\nauthority, i.e. from those who in each class are authorised to give decisions,\nthe (state of) affairs, i.e. the peculiar customs, the legal decision must be\ngiven in accordance with that which they declare to be the rule in their\ncommunity.'--Haradatta.\n\n[237:23](sbe0275.htm#fr_1148) Manu VIII, 44; XII, 105-106; Macnaghten,\nMitakshara II, 8, 8. Haradatta remarks that this Sutra refers to the case\nwhere the spokesmen of a guild may be suspected of partiality.\n\n[237:25](sbe0275.htm#fr_1149) Manu XII, 108-113, According to Haradatta this\nSutra refers to particularly difficult cases.\n\n[238:26](sbe0275.htm#fr_1150) \xc3\x82pastamba, II, 5, 11, 4.\n\n[238:29](sbe0275.htm#fr_1151) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 11, 10.\n\n[238:30](sbe0275.htm#fr_1152) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 11. 'Perish, i.e. fall from one\nmisfortune info the other.'--Haradatta.\n\n[238:31](sbe0275.htm#fr_1153) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 5, 10, 12-16.\n\n[238:32](sbe0275.htm#fr_1154) Manu VII, 8.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XII](sbe0276.htm)\n\n"
