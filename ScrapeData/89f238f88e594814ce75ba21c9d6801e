Try to follow the Sastaric (right\npath). The goal of mankind (human) can he achieved in this life, which is\nreached by means of two paths. One is by the way of Atmic Wisdom; the other,\nby the ordinary path, which leads to liberation. Virtuous people will attain\nliberation by following the Atmic Wisdom and through the association with the\nWise, thus developing high qualities."\n\nRam: "I am under control of desires, which I have made in my past lives. My\nefforts have not been in the right direction. O Master, what am I to do?"\n\nMaster Vashisht: "O Ram, by one\'s own efforts alone, can the Brahmic or Divine\nstate be achieved, and by none else. Desires can be classed under two\ndivisions: that of pure and impure. These desires will cling to future births.\nIf the impure desires are upper-most in one\'s life\n\np. 41\n\nthen misery is experienced by its future lives. In case that pure desires\nprevail, then liberation is easily acquired. O Ram, with all thy power,\ncultivate the Brahmic science. Free thyself of impure desires and retain the\npure. See all things with equal vision and strive to bar that door of the mind\nfrom whence cometh the impure desires; but open all other doors through which\ncometh the pure desires. Cast out all impure desires and generate the pure\nones. If doubt arises as to where these pure desires shall lead, thou shouldst\ncontinue to hold them, as no bad can come from them until thy mind has\nrealized the Reality of Brahm. Always follow the path of Brahm by Veda (the\nSacred Knowledge). Let Guru (spiritual teacher) initiate thee into Brahm. O\nRam, may thou remain immovable in the study of Realization. Free thy mind of\nimpure desires, and with pure desires attain the Atmic state which is free of\nall pain and suffering. Kill all thy illusory thoughts so that they may never\nbe resurrected again. Develop peace or mind and bliss within thyself. Free\nthyself of worldly desires and become One with Brahm. Try to understand the\nsignificance of the Holy sentence, "Tat Twamasi" (thou art that), and meditate\nupon the Reality."\n\np. 42\n\nRishi Vashisht\'s Own Story:\n\n"Now listen to Brahm\'s utterances. Out of the highest Chidakasa (highest\nEther) or wisdom which is all pervading and is the seat or root of all\nobjects, arose Brahm (Lord of Creation). Vishnu (The Preserver), the earth,\nand all other objects rose from his heart. Brahm (Lord of Universe) found that\nmany worthy souls were suffering in Bharatavarsa (Land of India). He was moved\nby pity for the liberation of these souls. He concluded that the cycle of\nbirth or death could not be controlled by Japa Chanting (of Mantras), Tapa\n(religious austerities), visiting Holy places, or by bathing in the Holy\nGanges: only through the Atmic Wisdom. By the power of his will, he created\nall mankind like unto himself. So, I was born and have paid my respects to\nhim. I was given a seat on the North side of him. There he cured me of my\nillusion which had enveloped me for some time. All my wisdom had deserted me.\nMy mind became confused and my actions were foolish, as are the actions of the\nignorant. When I came out of this state of mind, He asked me the cause of my\nmisery. In turn I asked him these questions: "How did this universe arise? How\nmay liberation\n\np. 43\n\nbe attained?" In answer to these questions, he blessed me with true liberation\nof highest state, through which I realized the highest Atmic Wisdom. He said,\n\'it was we, who put you under the influence of Maya (illusions) and released\nyou again. We have ordained that all souls shall be initiated by thy wisdom in\norder to attain their liberation. Thou shalt soon go to India which is the\nLand of Religions. Thou shalt initiate those who are seeking wisdom into the\nAtmic Wisdom, but not those who are lovers of egoism.\'\n\n"Accordingly I came to India and will live here as long as humanity exists. I\nhave no worldly desires, consequently, I will escape that dreamless sleep\nstate of existence. I have overcome that mental pain and misery, which is\nexperienced daily throughout the world. O Ram, only those who prefer the Atmic\nWisdom to the material knowledge will know the Atma (self).\n\n"There are four soldiers who guard the road to liberation. They are Patience\n(or peace of mind), Atmic Inquiry, Contentment, and Association with the Wise.\nIf you can succeed in making one of the above a friend, then the others will\nbe easy. That one will introduce you to\n\np. 44\n\nthe others. Without gaining their friendship, they will not. permit you to\nenter upon the road to liberation. So by all means, gain the friendship of one\nof the above and start on the road to liberation, for without liberation there\nis no end to rebirths. Association with the Wise will mean to you, what Garuda\nMantra means to the persons who have been bitten by the Cobra. (In India\npeople are cured of the cobra\'s poisonous bite by chanting Garuda Mantra).\nOnce that wisdom is attained then that person is safe--no harm can come to\nthat person. No one can achieve that blissful state by merely inquiring about\nthe Atmic Wisdom. It must come through self experience or through the help of\na Guru. Merely reading books of wisdom breeds more ignorance. Keep in mind\nthat it will be much better to live by begging food from the outcasts, than to\nlive an ignorant life. O Ram, if only one of the four guards is made your\nfriend--namely, Patience is mastered--then all your miseries and sorrows will\nfly from you as darkness flies from the light. Those who have mastered\npatience will never be upset by poverty or wealth. They will remain the same\nin peace or war. They will not make a distinction between\n\np. 45\n\nbirth and death. These noble people will be higher than the man of mere\nknowledge, and will surely attain liberation. May thou, O Ram, attain\npatience! If Atmic Inquiry along with patience should be developed, then\nsurely the state of the highest wisdom will be acquired. This Atmic-inquiry\nenables one to understand cause and effect, which is the seed of rebirth. One\nmust rid themselves of all doubt by the power of discrimination, which is\nalways a shining light. One should always make inquiry of, \'whence came I?\'\n\'Whence came the universe?\' Such inquiries dispel that dark cloud of\nignorance.\n\n"Contentment is the Noble who will set us free of all grief, for such arises\nonly from the sensual objects of desire. One who has mastered noble\ncontentment will always be happy. His mind will ever seek the Atmic Wisdom.\nPersons of contentment will ever be worshipped by all mankind.\n\n\n\n"Association with the Wise will help us to overcome the Maya (illusion). It is\nnot the bathing in the waters of the Holy Ganges, that is so helpful to the\nthousands that throng there each year, but the associations with the wise\n\np. 46\n\nare more helpful to self realization than making gifts, sacrifices, etc.. The\nWise are like ships that help us safely across the ocean of rebirths. These\nfour roads are the ways and means to bliss. O Ram, listen to these stories.\nThey are light, which dispel the delusion of Maya (illusion). Understand the\ninner meaning and search deeply for the Atmic Wisdom. All delusion will\nperish, and the mind will become calm and peaceful like the waters of a lake.\nSuch persons will not suffer the disappointments of life. They will not be\naffected by the storm of Maya (illusion). They will have balance of mind as\nsteady as the Himalaya Mountains. The truth seeker who will follow this path\nof Atmic Wisdom will always find enjoyment in Samadhi (meditation). This is\nthe way to Jivanmukta (emancipated embodiment). He is desireless, and nothing\nis supernatural to him. Words cannot describe this state of mind. He will move\nin this universe like all others, but his mind is free from the bondage of\nearthly desires. Good and bad cannot affect him. He will be recognized by\nothers as the happiest. He will not interfere with the paths of others, but\nalways follow the path of Atmic Wisdom. After he has reached this attainment,\nhe will never\n\np. 47\n\nbe born again. He is worthy of all his accomplishments, while others may not\nbe worthy even of their human birth. He should perform his duties of life\nearnestly, through earning and spending correctly. He should ever seek to\nreach this fourth state of existence through the Atmic inquiry, keeping his\nwell balanced mind alert, for this state is obtained only through Atmic\ninquiry.\n\n"He who attains the fourth state is above thought. If he is the Master of\nQuietness, he will surely gain liberation whether he lives with his family or\nalone; whether he is performing the daily duties of everyday life or not, he\nwill be one with the Reality. Follow this path and many analogies will be\ngiven out in order that Brahmic wisdom may be realized within thee, as all\nhave their purpose and aim in the One principle. The ignorant say that pure\nwisdom is not subject to analogies. Mixing of name and form should not be made\nsubject of this inquiry. Such absurd argument is not worthy, for Wisdom is\nobtained by the Atmic inquiry. O Ram, thou shouldst not let thy mind accept\nthoughts of doubt. Always remember these four: Patience, Atmic Inquiry,\nContentment and\n\np. 48\n\n[paragraph continues] Association with the Wise. These four guard the gate of\nliberation. No one can secure liberation until his friendship with the four is\ndeveloped. This is the road to the attainment of bliss. By attention to the\nfollowing stories, thou wilt surely attain wealth of Atmic Wisdom and a happy\nlife.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Creation of the Universe](yvhf07.htm)\n\n'
