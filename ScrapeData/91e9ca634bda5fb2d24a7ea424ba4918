And yet\nno other impediment is mentioned. Still his restless mind would not allow him\nto remain longer in the same spot. So the character of Vis'vamitra is\ningeniously and skilfully shadowed forth: as he had been formerly a most\nwarlike king, loving battle and glory, bold, active, sometimes unjust, and\nmore frequently magnanimous, such also he always shows himself in his\ncharacter of anchorite and ascetic.' SCHLEGEL.\n\n[72:2b](ry061.htm#fr_241) Near the modern city of Ajmere. The place is sacred\nstill, and the name is preserved in the Hindi. Lassen, however, says that this\nPushkala or Pushkara, called by the Grecian writers \xce\xa0\xce\xb5\xcf\x85\xce\xba\xce\xb5\xce\xbb\xe1\xbc\x80\xce\xaf\xcf\x84\xce\xb9\xcf\x82, the earliest\nplace of pilgrimage mentioned by name, is not to be confounded with the modern\nPushkara in Ajmere.\n\n[73:1](ry061.htm#fr_242) Ambarisha is the twenty-ninth in descent from\nIkshvaku, and is therefore separated by an immense space of time from\nTris'anku in whose story Vis'vamitra had played so important a part. Yet\nRichika, who is represented as having young sons while Ambarisha was yet\nreigning, being himself the son of Bhrigu and to be numbered with the most\nancient sages, is said to have married the younger sister of Vis'vamitra. But\nI need not again remark that there is a perpetual anachronism in Indian\nmythology.' SCHLEGEL.\n\n'In the mythical story related in this and the following Canto we may\ndiscover, I think, some indication of the epoch at which the immolation of\nlower animals was substituted for human sacrifice....\n\nSo when Iphigenia was about to be sacrificed at Aulis, one legend tells us\nthat a hind was substituted for the virgin.'\nGORRESIO.\n\nSo the ram caught in the thicket took the place of Isaac, or, as the Musalmans\nsay, of Ishmael.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LXII.: Ambaresha's Sacrifice.](ry062.htm)\n\n"
