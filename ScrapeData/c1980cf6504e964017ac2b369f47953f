He throws a grace  \nOn old Ikshvaku's royal race.  \nHe feels his years' increasing weight,  \nAnd makes his son associate.  \nGreat joy to us the choice will bring  \nOf Rama for our lord and king.  \nThe good and bad to him are known,  \nAnd long will he protect his own.  \nNo pride his prudent breast may swell,  \nMost just, he loves his brothers well,  \nAnd to us all that love extends,  \nCherished as brothers and as friends.  \nLong may our lord in life remain,  \nGood Das'aratha, free from stain,  \nBy whose most gracious favour we  \nRama anointed king shall see.'  \n\nSuch were the words the townsmen spoke  \nHeard by the gathering countryfolk,  \nWho from the south, north, east, and west,  \nStirred by the joyful tidings, pressed.  \nFor by their eager longing led  \nTo Rama's consecration sped  \nThe villagers from every side,  \nAnd filled Ayodhya's city wide.  \nThis way and that way strayed the crowd,  \nWhile rose a murmur long and loud,  \nAs when the full moon floods the skies  \nAnd Ocean's waves with thunder rise.  \n   That town, like Indra's city fair,  \n     While peasants thronged her ways.  \n   Tumultuous roared like Ocean, where  \n     Each flood-born monster plays.  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto VII.: Manthara's Lament.](ry085.htm)\n\n"
