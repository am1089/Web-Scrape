Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gala, having served under Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya for twelve years, asked him to\ninitiate him into the supreme mysteries of Kaivalya. To which Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya\nreplied thus: "O gentle one, at first, this (universe) was Sa\xe1\xb9\xad (Be-ness) only.\nIt (Sa\xe1\xb9\xad) is spoken of as Brahman which is ever free (from the trammels of\nmatter), which is changeless, which is Truth, Wisdom, and Bliss, and which is\nfull, permanent, and one only without a second. In It, was like a mirage in\nthe desert, silver in mother-of-pearl, a person in the pillar, or colour,\netc., in the crystals, m\xc5\xablaprak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi, having in equal proportions the gu\xe1\xb9\x87as,\nred, 2 white, and black, and being beyond the power of speech. That which is\nreflected in it is S\xc4\x81kshi-Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya (lit., the witness-consciousness), It\n(m\xc5\xablaprak\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadi) undergoing again change becomes with the preponderance of Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva\n(in it), \xc4\x80vara\xe1\xb9\x87a 3 \xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi named avyak\xe1\xb9\xada. That which is reflected in it\n(Avyak\xe1\xb9\xada) is \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara-Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya. He (\xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara) has M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 under his control, is\nomniscient, the original cause of creation, preservation, and dissolution, and\nthe seed of this universe. He causes the universe which was latent in Him, to\nmanifest itself through the bonds of karma of all creatures like a painted\ncanvas unfurled. Again through the extinction\n\np. 44\n\nof their karmas, he makes it disappear. In Him alone is latent all the\nuniverse, wrapped up like a painted cloth. Then from the supreme (\xc4\x80vara\xe1\xb9\x87a)\n\xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi, dependent on (or appertaining to \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara, arose, through the\npreponderance of Rajas, Vikshepa 1 \xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi called Maha\xe1\xb9\xad. That which is reflected\nin it is Hira\xe1\xb9\x87yagarbha-Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya. Presiding (as He does) over Maha\xe1\xb9\xad, He\n(Hira\xe1\xb9\x87yagarbha) has a body, both manifested and unmanifested. 2 From Vikshepa\n\xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi, of Hira\xe1\xb9\x87yagarbha arose, through the preponderance of \xe1\xb9\xacamas, the gross\n\xc5\x9aak\xe1\xb9\xadi called aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra. That which is reflected in it is Vir\xc4\x81t-Chai\xe1\xb9\xadanya. He\n(Vir\xc4\x81t) presiding over it (aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra) and possessing a manifested body becomes\nVish\xe1\xb9\x87u, the chief Purusha and protector of all gross bodies. From that \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81\narose \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b; from \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b arose v\xc4\x81yu, from v\xc4\x81yu agni, from agni apas, and from\napas p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab. The five \xe1\xb9\xadanm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadras 3 (rudimentary properties) alone are the\ngu\xe1\xb9\x87as (of the above five). That generating cause of the universe (\xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara)\nwishing to create and having assumed \xe1\xb9\xadamo-gu\xe1\xb9\x87a, wanted to convert the elements\nwhich were subtle \xe1\xb9\xadanm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadras into gross ones. In order to create the universe,\nhe divided into two parts each of those divisible elements; and having divided\neach moiety into four parts, made a fivefold mixture, each element having\nmoiety of its own original element and one-fourth of a moiety of each of the\nother elements, and thus evolved out of the fivefold classified gross\nelements, the many myriads of Brahm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87das (Brahma\'s egg or macrocosm), the\nfourteen worlds pertaining to each sphere, and the spherical gross bodies\n(microcosm) fit for the (respective) worlds. Having divided the Rajas-essence\nof the five elements into four parts, He out of three such parts created (the\nfive) pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as having fivefold function. Again out of the (remaining) fourth\npart, He created karmen\xe1\xb8\x8driyas (the organs of action). Having divided their\nSa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva-essence into four parts, He out of three such parts created the\nanta\xe1\xb8\xa5kara\xe1\xb9\x87a (internal organ) having fivefold\n\np. 45\n\nfunction. Out of the (remaining) fourth part of \xc5\x9aa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva-essence, he created the\nj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81nen\xe1\xb8\x8driyas (organs of sense). Out of the collective totality of Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva-\nessence, He created the \xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81s (deities) ruling over the organs of sense and\nactions. Those (\xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81s) He created, He located in the spheres (pertaining to\nthem). They through His orders, began to pervade the macrocosm. Through His\norders, Virat associated with aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra created all the gross things. Through\nHis orders, Hira\xe1\xb9\x87yagarbha protected the subtle things. Without Him, they that\nwere located in their spheres were unable to move or to do anything. Then He\nwished to infuse che\xe1\xb9\xadana (life) into them. Having pierced the Brahm\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87da\n(Brahma\'s egg or macrocosm) and Brahmaran\xe1\xb8\x8dhras (head-fontanelle) in all the\nmicrocosmic heads, He entered within. Though they were (at first) inert, they\nwere then able to perform karmas like beings of intelligence. The omniscient\n\xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara entered the microcosmic bodies with a particle of M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 and being\ndeluded by that M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81, acquired the state of diva. Identifying the three bodies\nwith Himself, He acquired the state of the actor and enjoyer. Associated with\nthe attributes of the states of j\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xad, svapna, sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi, trance, and death\nand being immersed in sorrow, he is (whirled about and) deluded like water-\nlift or potter\'s wheel, as if subject to birth and death."\n\n##### A\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81ya II\n\nPai\xe1\xb9\x85gala again addressed Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya thus: "How did \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara, who is the\ncreator, preserver, and destroyer and the Lord of all the worlds, acquire the\nstate of J\xc4\xabva?" To which Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya replied: "I shall tell in detail the\nnature of J\xc4\xabva and \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara, together with a description of the origin of the\ngross, subtle, and k\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87a (causal) bodies. Hear attentively with one-pointed\nmind.\n\n"\xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara having taken a small portion of the quintuplicated mah\xc4\x81-bh\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadas, (the\ngreat elements), made in regular order the gross bodies, both collective and\nsegregate. The skull, the skin, the intestines, bone, flesh, and nails are of\nthe essence of p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab. Blood, urine, saliva, sweat and others are of the\nessence of\n\np. 46\n\n\xc4\x81pas. Hunger, thirst, heat, delusion, and copulation are of the essence of\nagni. Walking, lifting, breathing and others are of the essence of v\xc4\x81yu.\nPassion, anger, etc., are of the essence of \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. The collection of these\nhaving touch and the rest is this gross body that is brought about by karma,\nthat is the seat of egoism in youth and other states and that is the abode of\nmany sins. Then He created pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as out of the collective three parts of Rajas-\nessence of the fivefold divided elements. The modifications of pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a are\npr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, ap\xc4\x81na, vy\xc4\x81na, ud\xc4\x81na, and sam\xc4\x81na; n\xc4\x81ga, karma, k\xe1\xb9\x9bkara, \xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb8\x8da\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada and\ndhana\xc3\xb1jaya are the auxiliary pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as. (Of the first five), the heart, anus,\nnavel, throat and the whole body are respectively the seats. Then He created\nthe karmen\xe1\xb8\x8driyas out of the fourth part of the Rajas-gu\xe1\xb9\x87a. Of \'Olds\' and the\nrest the mouth, legs, hands, and the organs of secretion and excretion are the\nmodifications. Talking, walking, lifting, excreting, and enjoying are their\nfunctions. Likewise out of the collective three parts of Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva-essence, He\ncreated the anta\xe1\xb8\xa5kara\xe1\xb9\x87a (internal organ). An\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb8\xa5kara\xe1\xb9\x87a, 1 manas, bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi,\nchi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada, and aha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra are the modifications. Sa\xe1\xb9\x85kalpa (thought), certitude,\nmemory, egoism, and anusan\xe1\xb8\x8dh\xc4\x81na (inquiry) are their functions. Throat, face,\nnavel, 2 heart, and the middle of the brow are their seats. Out of the\n(remaining) fourth part of Sa\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva-essence, He created the j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81nen\xe1\xb8\x8driyas (organs\nof sense). Ear, skin, eyes, tongue, and nose are the modifications. Sound,\ntouch, form, taste, and odour are their functions. \xe1\xb8\x8cik (the quarters), V\xc4\x81yu,\nArka (the sun), Varu\xe1\xb9\x87a, A\xc5\x9bvini \xe1\xb8\x8cevas, In\xe1\xb8\x8dra, Upen\xe1\xb8\x8dra, M\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadyu (the God of\ndeath), Praj\xc4\x81pa\xe1\xb9\xadi, the Moon, Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u the four-faced Brahma and \xc5\x9aambhu (\xc5\x9aiva)\nare the presiding deities of the organs. There are the five ko\xc5\x9bas (sheaths),\n_viz_., annamaya, pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87amaya, manomaya, vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81namaya, and \xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8damaya. Annamaya\nsheath is that which is created and developed out of the essence of food, and\nis absorbed into the earth which is of the form of food. It alone is the gross\nbody. The pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as with the karmen\xe1\xb8\x8driyas (organs of action) is the pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87amaya\n\np. 47\n\nsheath. Manas with the j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81nen\xe1\xb8\x8driyas (organs of sense) is the manomaya sheath.\nBu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi with the j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81nen\xe1\xb8\x8driyas is the vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81namaya sheath. These three sheaths\nconstitute the li\xe1\xb9\x85ga\xc5\x9bar\xc4\xabra (or the subtle body). (That which tends to) the\naj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na (ignorance) of the Reality (of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) is the \xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8damaya sheath. This is\nthe k\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87a body. Moreover the five organs of sense, the five organs of action,\nthe five pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as and others, the five \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b and other elements, the four\ninternal organs, avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81, passion, karma, and Lamas--all these constitute this\ntown (of body).\n\n"Vir\xc4\x81t, under the orders of \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara having entered this microcosmic body, and\nhaving bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi as his vehicle, reaches the state of Vi\xc5\x9bva. Then he goes by the\nseveral names of Vi\xc3\xb1j\xc4\x81n\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma, Chi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81sa, Vi\xc5\x9bva, Vy\xc4\x81vah\xc4\x81rika, the one presiding\nover the waking gross body and the one generated by karma. S\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xadr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, under the\norders of \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara, having entered the microcosmic subtle body, and having manas\nas his vehicle, reaches the \xe1\xb9\xacaijasa state. Then he goes by the names of\n\xe1\xb9\xadaijasa, pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadibh\xc4\x81sika and svapnakalpi\xe1\xb9\xada (the one bred out of dream). Then\nunder the orders of \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara, he who is coupled with avyak\xe1\xb9\xada, the vehicle of\nM\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 having entered the microcosmic k\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87a body, reaches the state of praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81.\nHe goes then by the names of praj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81, avichchinna, and p\xc4\x81ram\xc4\x81r\xe1\xb9\xadhika and\nsushup\xe1\xb9\xadhi-abhim\xc4\x81ni (the presider over sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi). Such sacred sentences, as\n\xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvamasi (That art thou) and others, speak of the identity with the Brahman\nof the P\xc4\x81ram\xc4\x81r\xe1\xb9\xadhika-J\xc4\xabva enveloped by aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, which is but a small particle of\navyak\xe1\xb9\xada; but not vy\xc4\x81vah\xc4\x81rika and pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadibh\xc4\x81sika (J\xc4\xabvas). It is only that\nchai\xe1\xb9\xadanya which is reflected in anta\xe1\xb8\xa5kara\xe1\xb9\x87a that attains the three states.\nWhen it assumes the three states of j\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xad, swapna, and sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi, it is like a\nwater-lift as if grieved, born and dead. There are five avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81s--j\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xad,\nswapna, sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi, m\xc5\xabrchchh\xc4\x81 (trance), and death. J\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xad avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81 is that in\nwhich there is the perception of objects, of sound, etc., through the grace of\nthe \xe1\xb8\x8deva\xe1\xb9\xad\xc4\x81 presiding over each of them. In it, the J\xc4\xabva, being in the middle\nof the eyebrows and pervading the body from head to foot, becomes the agent of\nactions, such as doing, hearing and others. He becomes also the enjoyer of the\n\np. 48\n\nfruits thereof; and such a person doing karma for the fruits thereof goes to\nother worlds and enjoys the same there. Like an emperor tired of worldly acts\n(in the waking state), he strives to find the path to retire into his abode\nwithin. The svapna avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81 is that in which, when the senses are at rest,\nthere is the manifestation of the knower and the known, along with the\naffinities of (things enjoyed in) the waking state. In this state Vi\xc5\x9bva alone,\nits actions in the waking state having ceased, reaches the state of \xe1\xb9\xacaijasa\n(of \xe1\xb9\xadejas or effulgence), who moves in the middle of the n\xc4\x81d\xc4\xabs (nerves),\nilluminates by his lustre the heterogeneity of this universe which is of the\nform of affinities, and himself enjoys according to his wish. The sushup\xe1\xb9\xadi\navas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81 is that in which the chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada is sole organ (at play). Just as a bird,\ntired of roaming, flies to its nest with its stomach filled, so the J\xc4\xabva being\ntired of the actions of the world in the waking and dreaming states, enters\naj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na and enjoys bliss. Then trance is attained which resembles death, and in\nwhich one with his collection of organs quails, as it were, through fear and\naj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, like one beaten unexpectedly by a hammer, club or any other weapon.\nThen death avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81 is that which is other than the avas\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81s of j\xc4\x81gra\xe1\xb9\xad, svapna,\nsushup\xe1\xb9\xadi, and trance, which produces fear in all J\xc4\xabvas from Brahma down to\nsmall insects and which dissolves the gross body. The J\xc4\xabva, that is surrounded\nby avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 and the subtle elements, takes with it the organs of sense and\naction, their objects, and pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as along with the k\xc4\x81mic karmas and goes to\nanother world, assuming another body. Through the ripening of the fruits of\nprevious karmas, the J\xc4\xabva has no rest like an insect in a whirlpool. It is\nonly after many births that the desire of emancipation arises in man through\nthe ripening of good karma. Then having resorted to a good Guru and served\nunder him for a long time, one out of many attains moksha, free from bondage.\nBondage is through non-inquiry and moksha through inquiry. Therefore there\nshould always be inquiry (into \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81). The Reality should be ascertained\nthrough a\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81ropa (illusory attribution) and apav\xc4\x81d (withdrawal or recession\nof that idea). Therefore there\n\np. 49\n\nshould be always inquiring into the universe, J\xc4\xabva and Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Were the\ntrue nature of J\xc4\xabva and the universe known, then there remains Brahman which\nis non-different from Pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81."\n\n#### A\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81ya III\n\nThen Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gala asked Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya to offer an exposition on the mah\xc4\x81v\xc4\x81kyas\n(sacred sentences of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das). To which Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya replied: "One should\nscrutinise (the sacred sentences), \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvamasi (That art thou), \xe1\xb9\xacvam\xe1\xb9\xada\xe1\xb8\x8dasi\n(Thou art That), \xe1\xb9\xacwambrahmasi (Thou art Brahman) and Ahambrahm\xc4\x81smi (I am\nBrahman). The word \'\xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\' denotes the cause of the universe that is variegated\nbeyond perception, has the characteristics of omniscience, has M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 as His\nvehicle and has the attributes of Sachchi\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81nan\xe1\xb8\x8da. It is He that is the basis\nof the notion \'I\' which has the differentiated knowledge produced by\nanta\xe1\xb8\xa5kara\xe1\xb9\x87a; and it is He that is denoted by the word \'\xe1\xb9\xacwam\' (Thou). That is\nthe undifferentiated Brahman which remains as the aim (or meaning) of the\nwords \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad and \xe1\xb9\xacvam after freeing itself from M\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81 and Avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81 which are\nrespectively the vehicles of Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and J\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. The inquiry into the real\nsignificance of the sentences \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvamasi and Ahambrahm\xc4\x81smi forms (what is\ncalled) \xc5\x9brava\xe1\xb9\x87a (hearing--the first stage of inquiry). To inquire in solitude\ninto the significance of \xc5\x9brava\xe1\xb9\x87a is manana. The concentration of the mind with\none-pointedness upon that which should be sought after by \xc5\x9brava\xe1\xb9\x87a and manana\nis ni\xe1\xb8\x8di\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81sana. Sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi is that state in which chi\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xada having given up (the\nconception of the difference of) the meditator and the meditation, becomes of\nthe form of the meditated like a lamp in a place without wind. Then arise the\nmodifications pertaining to \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Such (modifications) cannot be known; but\nthey can only be inferred through memory (of the sam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi state). The myriads\nof karmas committed in this beginningless cycle of rebirths are annihilated\nonly through them. Through proficiency in practice, the current of nectar 1\n\np. 50\n\nalways rains down in diverse ways. Therefore those who know Yoga call this\nsam\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi, \xe1\xb8\x8dharma-megha (cloud). Through these (modifications of \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81), the\ncollection of affinities is absorbed without any remainder whatever. When the\naccumulated good and bad karmas are wholly destroyed, these sentences\n(\xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadvamasi and Ahambrahm\xc4\x81smi), like the myrobalan in the palm of the hand,\nbring him face to face with the ultimate Reality, though It was before\ninvisible. Then he becomes a J\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xada.\n\n"\xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara wished to produce non-quintuplication (or involution) in the fivefold\ndifferentiated elements. Having drawn into their cause Brahma\'s egg and its\neffects of worlds, and mixed together the subtle organs of sense and action\nand the four internal organs and dissolved all things composed of the elements\ninto their cause, the five elements, He then caused p\xe1\xb9\x9b\xe1\xb9\xadhiv\xc4\xab to merge into\nwater, water into agni, agni into v\xc4\x81yu, and v\xc4\x81yu into \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b into\naha\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra, aka\xe1\xb9\x85k\xc4\x81ra into maha\xe1\xb9\xad, maha\xe1\xb9\xad into avyak\xe1\xb9\xada, and avyak\xe1\xb9\xada into Purusha in\nregular order. Virat, Hira\xe1\xb9\x87yagarbha and \xc4\xaa\xc5\x9bvara being freed from the vehicle of\nM\xc4\x81y\xc4\x81, are absorbed into Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. This gross body composed of the five\ndifferentiated elements and obtained through accumulated karma, is merged into\nits subtle state of non-quintuplicated elements, through the extinction of\n(bad) karma and increase of good karma, then attains its k\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87a (causal) state\nand (finally) is absorbed into its cause, ( _viz_.,) K\xc5\xabtas\xe1\xb9\xadha-Pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadma.\nVi\xc5\x9bva and \xe1\xb9\xacaijasa and Pr\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1a, their up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi (of avi\xe1\xb8\x8dy\xc4\x81) having become extinct,\nare absorbed in Pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. This sphere (of universe) being burnt up by the\nfire of j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na is absorbed along with its cause into Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Therefore a\nBr\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87a should be careful and always meditate upon the identity of \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad and\n\xe1\xb9\xacvam. Then \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 shines, like the sun freed from the (obscuration of the)\nclouds. One should meditate upon \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 in the midst (of the body) like a lamp\nwithin a jar.\n\n"\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, the K\xc5\xabtas\xe1\xb9\xadha, should be meditated upon as being of the size of a thumb,\nas being of the nature of the jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis (light) without smoke, as being within,\nilluminating all and as being\n\np. 51\n\nindestructible. That Muni (sage) who meditates (upon \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 always) until sleep\nor death comes upon him passes into the state of (J\xc4\xabvanmuk\xe1\xb9\xadi) emancipation\nlike the immovable state of the wind. Then there remains that One (Brahman)\nwithout sound, touch, free from destruction, without taste or odour, which is\neternal, which is without beginning or end, which is beyond, the \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva of\nMaha\xe1\xb9\xad, and which is permanent and without stain or disease."\n\n##### A\xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81ya IV\n\nThen Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gala addressed Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya thus: "To the wise, what is their karma?\nAnd what is their state?" To which Y\xc4\x81j\xc3\xb1avalkya replied: "A lover of moksha,\nhaving humility 1 and other possessions (or virtues), enables twenty-one\ngenerations to cross (to \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81). One through his being a Brahmavi\xe1\xb9\xad 2 alone\nenables 101 generations to cross. Know \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 to be the rider and the body as\nthe chariot. Know also bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi as the charioteer and manas as the reins. The\nwise say the organs are the horses, the objects are the roads (through which\nthe horses travel) and the hearts are the moving balloons. Mah\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x9bshis say that\n\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81, when associated with the sense organs and manas, is the enjoyer.\nTherefore it is the actual N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a alone that is established in the heart.\nTill his pr\xc4\x81rab\xe1\xb8\x8dha karma 3 is worn out, he exists (in his body) as in the\n(cast-off) slough of a serpent (without any desire for the body). An\nemancipated person having such a body roves about like a moon gladdening all\nwith no settled place of abode. He gives up his body whether in a sacred\nplace, or in a cha\xe1\xb9\x85d\xc4\x81la\'s (out-caste\'s) house (without any distinction\nwhatever), and attains salvation. Such a body (when seen by a person) should\nbe offered as a sacrifice to \xe1\xb8\x8dik (the quarters) or should be buried\n(underground). It is only to Purusha (the wise) that sanny\xc4\x81sa (renunciation)\nis ordained and not to others. In case of the\n\np. 52\n\ndeath of an ascetic who is of the form (or has attained the nature) of\nBrahman, there is no pollution (to be observed); neither the ceremonies of\nfire (as burning the body, homa, etc.); nor the pi\xe1\xb9\x87da (balls of rice), nor\nceremonies of water, nor the periodical ceremonies (monthly and yearly). Just\nas a food once cooked is not again cooked, so a body once burnt (by the fire\nof wisdom) should not be burnt (or exposed to fire) again. To one whose body\nwas burnt by the fire of wisdom there is neither \xc5\x9br\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dha 1 (required to be\nperformed), nor (funeral) ceremony. So long as there is the up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhi (of non-\nwisdom) in one, so long should he serve the Guru. He should conduct himself\ntowards his Guru\'s wife and children as he does to his Guru. If being of a\npure mind, of the nature of immaculate Chi\xe1\xb9\xad and resigned, and having the\ndiscrimination arising from the attainment of wisdom "I am He," he should\nconcentrate his heart on Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and obtain firm peace in his body, then he\nbecomes of the nature of Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis, void of manas and bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi. Of what avail is\nmilk to one content with nectar? Of what avail are the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das to him who has\nknown his \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 thus? For a Yogin content with the nectar of wisdom, there is\nnothing more to be done. If he has to do anything, then he is not a knower of\n\xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva. Pra\xe1\xb9\xadyag\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 though far (or difficult of attainment), is not far;\nthough in the body, he is devoid of it (since) he is all-pervading. After\nhaving purified the heart and contemplated on the One without disease (\n_viz_., Brahman), the cognizing of \'I\' as the supreme and the all is the\nhighest bliss. Like water mixed with water, milk with milk, and ghee with\nghee, so J\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 and Param\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 are without difference. When the body is\nrendered bright through wisdom and the bu\xe1\xb8\x8d\xe1\xb8\x8dhi becomes of the partless One,\nthen the wise man burns the bondage of karma through the fire of Brahma-j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na.\nThen he becomes purified, of the nature of the non-dual named Parme\xc5\x9bvara and\nthe light like the stainless \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. Like water mixed with water, so J\xc4\xabva\n(-\xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) becomes up\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhiless (or freed from the bonds of matter). \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadma, is, like\n\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b, of an invisible form. (Therefore) the inner \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is invisible like v\xc4\x81yu.\nThough he is within and without, he is the immovable\n\np. 53\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81. Through the torch of wisdom, the internal \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81\nsees (or knows) .\n\n"A wise man, in whatever place or manner he dies, is absorbed in that place\nlike the all-pervading \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b. It should be known that \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81 is absorbed as truly\nas the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b in the pot (when broken). Then he attains the all-pervading\nwisdom-light that is without support. Though men should perform \xe1\xb9\xadapas standing\non one leg for a period of 1,000 years, it will not, in the least, be equal to\none-sixteenth part of \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81nayoga. One desirous of knowing what j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na (wisdom)\nand j\xc3\xb1eya (the object to be known) are, will not be able to attain his desired\nend, even though he may study the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras for 1,000 years. That which is alone\nshould be known as the indestructible. That which exists (in this world) is\nonly impermanent. (Therefore) after having given up (the study of) the many\n\xc5\x9a\xc4\x81s\xe1\xb9\xadras, one should worship that which is sa\xe1\xb9\xadya (truth). The many karmas,\npurity (of mind and heart), japa (the muttering of man\xe1\xb9\xadras), sacrifice and\npilgrimages--all these should be observed till \xe1\xb9\xaca\xe1\xb9\xad\xe1\xb9\xadva is known. For Mahatmas\n(noble souls) to be always in (the conception of) \'I am Brahman\' conduces to\ntheir salvation. There are two causes (that lead) to bondage and emancipation.\nThey are \'mine\' and \'not mine\'. Through \'mine\' creatures are bound, whereas\nthrough \'not mine\' they are released from bondage. When the mind attains the\nstate of Unmani (above manas, _viz_., when it is destroyed), then there is\nnever the conception of duality. When the Unmani state occurs, then is the\nsupreme Seat (attained). (After which) wherever the mind goes, there is the\nsupreme Seat (to it, _viz_., the mind enjoys salvation wherever it is). That\nwhich is equal in all is Brahman alone. One may attain the power to strike the\n\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b with his fist; he may appease his hunger by eating husks (of grain), but\nnever shall he attain emancipation who has not the self-cognition, \'I am\nBrahman\'.\n\n"Whoever recites this Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d becomes as immaculate as Agni. He becomes as\npare as Brahma. He becomes as pure as V\xc4\x81yu. He becomes like one who has bathed\nin all the holy waters. He becomes like one who has studied all the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das. He\nbecomes like one that has undergone all ve\xe1\xb8\x8dic observances. He\n\np. 54\n\nobtains the fruit of the recitation of I\xe1\xb9\xadih\xc4\x81sas 1, Pur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as and Ru\xe1\xb8\x8draman\xe1\xb9\xadras a\nlakh of times. He becomes like one that has pronounced Pra\xe1\xb9\x87ava (Om) ten\nthousand times. He purifies his ancestors ten degrees removed and his\ndescendants ten degrees removed. He becomes purified of all those that sit\nwith him for dinner. He becomes a great personage. He becomes purified from\nthe sins of the murder of a Brahman, the drinking of alcohol, theft of gold,\nand sexual cohabitation with Guru\'s wife, and from the sins of associating\nwith those that commit such sins.\n\n"Like the eye pervading the \xc4\x81ka\xc5\x9b (seeing without effort everything above), a\nwise man sees (always) the supreme Seat of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u.
