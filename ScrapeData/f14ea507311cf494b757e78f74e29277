Intelligence free from all difference.--\nThis we cannot allow. For the section in which the quoted text occurs, in\norder to make good the initial declaration that by the knowledge of one thing\nall things are known, shows that the highest Brahman which is denoted by the\nterm \'Being\' is the substantial and also the operative cause of the world;\nthat it is all-knowing, endowed with all powers; that its purposes come true;\nthat it is the inward principle, the support and the ruler of everything; and\nthat distinguished by these and other good qualities it constitutes the Self\nof the entire world; and then finally proceeds to instruct _S_ vetaketu that\nthis Brahman constitutes his Self also (\'Thou art that\'). We have fully set\nforth this point in the Vedartha-sa _m_ graha and shall establish it in\ngreater detail in the present work also, in the so-called arambha _n_\na-adhikara _n_ a.--In the same way the passage \'the higher knowledge is that\nby which the Indestructible is apprehended, &c.\' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5) first\ndenies of Brahman all the evil qualities connected with Prak _ri_ ti, and then\nteaches that to it there belong eternity, all-pervadingness. subtilty,\nomnipresence, omniscience, imperishableness,\n\np. 79\n\ncreativeness with regard to all beings, and other auspicious qualities. Now we\nmaintain that also the text \'True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman\', does not\nprove a substance devoid of all difference, for the reason that the co-\nordination of the terms of which it consists explains itself in so far only as\ndenoting one thing distinguished by several attributes. For \'co-ordination\'\n(samanadhikara _n_ ya, lit.\'the abiding of several things in a common\nsubstrate\') means the reference (of several terms) to one thing, there being a\ndifference of reason for the application (of several terms to one thing). Now\nwhether we take the several terms,\' True\',\'Knowledge\',\'Infinite\', in their\nprimary sense, i.e. as denoting qualities, or as denoting modes of being\nopposed to whatever is contrary to those qualities; in either case we must\nneeds admit a plurality of causes for the application of those several terms\nto one thing. There is however that difference between the two alternatives\nthat in the former case the terms preserve their primary meaning, while in the\nlatter case their denotative power depends on so-called \'implication\' (laksha\n_n_ a). Nor can it be said that the opposition in nature to non-\nknowledge,&c.(which is the purport of the terms on the hypothesis of laksha\n_n_ a), constitutes nothing more than the essential nature (of one non-\ndifferenced substance; the three terms thus having one purport only); for as\nsuch essential nature would be sufficiently apprehended through one term, the\nemployment of further terms would be purposeless. This view would moreover be\nin conflict with co-ordination, as it would not allow of difference of motive\nfor several terms applied to one thing. On the other hand it cannot be urged\nagainst the former alternative that the distinction of several attributes\npredicated of one thing implies a distinction in the thing to which the\nattributes belong, and that from this it follows that the several terms denote\nseveral things--a result which also could not be reconciled with \'co-\nordination\'; for what \'co-ordination\' aims at is just to convey the idea of\none thing being qualified by several attributes. For the grammarians define\n\'coordination\' as the application, to one thing, of several words,\n\np. 80\n\nfor the application of each of which there is a different motive.\n\nYou have further maintained the following view:--In the text \'one only without\na second\', the phrase \'without a second\' negatives all duality on Brahman\'s\npart even in so far as qualities are concerned. We must therefore, according\nto the principle that all _S_ akhas convey the same doctrine, assume that all\ntexts which speak of Brahman as cause, aim at setting forth an absolutely non-\ndual substance. Of Brahman thus indirectly defined as a cause, the text \'The\nTrue, knowledge, infinite is Brahman,\' contains a direct definition; the\nBrahman here meant to be defined must thus be devoid of all qualities.\nOtherwise, moreover, the text would be in conflict with those other texts\nwhich declare Brahman to be without qualities and blemish.--But this also\ncannot be admitted. What the phrase \'without a second\' really aims at\nintimating is that Brahman possesses manifold powers, and this it does by\ndenying the existence of another ruling principle different from Brahman. That\nBrahman actually possesses manifold powers the text shows further on, \'It\nthought, may I be many, may I grow forth,\' and \'it sent forth fire,\' and so\non.--But how are we to know that the mere phrase \'without a second\' is meant\nto negative the existence of all other causes in general?--As follows, we\nreply. The clause \'Being only this was in the beginning, one only,\' teaches\nthat Brahman when about to create constitutes the substantial cause of the\nworld. Here the idea of some further operative cause capable of giving rise to\nthe effect naturally presents itself to the mind, and hence we understand that\nthe added clause \'without a second\' is meant to negative such an additional\ncause. If it were meant absolutely to deny all duality, it would deny also the\neternity and other attributes of Brahman which you yourself assume. You in\nthis case make just the wrong use of the principle of all the-- _S_ akhas\ncontaining the same doctrine; what this principle demands is that the\nqualities attributed in all-- _S_ akhas to Brahman as cause should be taken\nover into the passage under discussion also. The same consideration teaches us\nthat also the\n\np. 81\n\ntext \'True, knowledge\', &c., teaches Brahman to possess attributes; for this\npassage has to be interpreted in agreement with the texts referring to Brahman\nas a cause. Nor does this imply a conflict with the texts which declare\nBrahman to be without qualities; for those texts are meant to negative the\nevil qualities depending on Prak _ri_ ti.--Those texts again which refer to\nmere knowledge declare indeed that knowledge is the essential nature of\nBrahman, but this does not mean that mere knowledge constitutes the\nfundamental reality. For knowledge constitutes the essential nature of a\nknowing subject only which is the substrate of knowledge, in the same way as\nthe sun, lamps, and gems are the substrate of Light. That Brahman is a knowing\nsubject all scriptural texts declare; cp. \'He who is all knowing\' (Mu. Up. I,\n1, 9); \'It thought\' ( _Kh_. Up.VI, 2, 3); \'This divine being thought\' ( _Kh_.\nUp. VI, 3, 2); \'He thought, let me send forth the worlds\' (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II,4, 1,\n2); \'He who arranges the wishes--as eternal of those who are not eternal, as\nthinker of (other) thinkers, as one of many\' (Ka. Up. II, 5, 13); \'There are\ntwo unborn ones--one who knows, one who does not know--one strong, the other\nweak\' ( _S_ vet. Up. I, 9); \'Let us know Him, the highest of Lords, the great\nLord, the highest deity of deities, the master of masters, the highest above\nthe god, the lord of the world, the adorable one\' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 7); \'Of\nhim there is known no effect (body) or instrument; no one is seen like unto\nhim or better; his high power is revealed as manifold, forming his essential\nnature, as knowledge, strength, and action\' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 8); \'That is\nthe Self, free from sin, ageless, deathless, griefless, free from hunger and\nthirst, whose wishes are true, whose purposes are true\' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1,\n5). These and other texts declare that to Brahman, whose essential nature is\nknowledge, there belong many excellent qualities--among which that of being a\nknowing subject stands first, and that Brahman is free from all evil\nqualities. That the texts referring to Brahman as free from qualities, and\nthose which speak of it as possessing qualities, have really one and the same\nobject may be inferred from the last of the\n\np. 82\n\npassages quoted above; the earlier part of which--\'free from sin,\' up to \'free\nfrom thirst\'--denies of Brahman all evil qualities, while its latter\npart--\'whose wishes are true,\' and so on--asserts of its certain excellent\nqualities. As thus there is no contradiction between the two classes of texts,\nthere is no reason whatever to assume that either of them has for its object\nsomething that is false.--With regard to the concluding passage of the\nTaittiriya-text, \'from whence all speech, together with the mind, turns away,\nunable to reach it 1,\' we point out that with the passage \'From terror of it\nthe wind blows,\' there begins a declaration of the qualities of Brahman, and\nthat the next section \'one hundred times that human bliss,\' &c., makes\nstatements as to the relative bliss enjoyed by the different classes of\nembodied souls; the concluding passage \'He who knows the bliss of that Brahman\nfrom whence all speech, together with the mind, turns away unable to reach\nit,\' hence must be taken as proclaiming with emphasis the infinite nature of\nBrahman\'s auspicious qualities. Moreover, a clause in the chapter under\ndiscussion--viz. \'he obtains all desires, together with Brahman the all-wise\'\n(II, 1)--which gives information as to the fruit of the knowledge of Brahman\nclearly declares the infinite nature of the qualities of the highest all-wise\nBrahman. The desires are the auspicious qualities of Brahman which are the\nobjects of desire; the man who knows Brahman obtains, together with Brahman,\nall qualities of it. The expression \'together with\' is meant to bring out the\nprimary importance of the qualities; as also described in the so-called\ndahara-vidya ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 1). And that fruit and meditation are of the\nsame character (i.e. that in meditations on Brahman its qualities are the\nchief matter of meditation, just as these qualities are the principal point in\nBrahman reached by the Devotee) is proved by the text \'According to what a\nman\'s thought is in this world, so will he be after he has\n\np. 83\n\ndeparted this life\' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 1). If it be said that the passage\n\'By whom it is not thought by him it is thought\', \'not understood by those who\nunderstand\' (Ke. Up. II, 3), declares Brahman not to be an object of\nknowledge; we deny this, because were it so, certain other texts would not\nteach that final Release results from knowledge; cp. \'He who knows Brahman\nobtains the Highest\' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); \'He knows Brahman, he becomes\nBrahman.\' And, moreover, the text \'He who knows Brahman as non-existing\nbecomes himself non-existing; he who knows Brahman as existing, him we know\nhimself as existing\' (Taitt Up. II, 6, 1), makes the existence and non-\nexistence of the Self dependent on the existence and non-existence of\nknowledge which has Brahman for its object. We thus conclude that all\nscriptural texts enjoin just the knowledge of Brahman for the sake of final\nRelease. This knowledge is, as we already know, of the nature of meditation,\nand what is to be meditated on is Brahman as possessing qualities. (The text\nfrom the Ke. Up. then explains itself as follows:--) We are informed by the\npassage \'from whence speech together with mind turns away, being unable to\nreach it\', that the infinite Brahman with its unlimited excellences cannot be\ndefined either by mind or speech as being so or so much, and from this we\nconclude the Kena text to mean that Brahman is not thought and not understood\nby those who understand it to be of a definitely limited nature; Brahman in\ntruth being unlimited. If the text did not mean this, it would be self-\ncontradictory, parts of it saying that Brahman is _not_ thought and _not_\nunderstood, and other parts, that it _is_ thought and _is_ understood.\n\nNow as regards the assertion that the text \'Thou mayest not see the seer of\nseeing; thou mayest not think the thinker of thinking\' (B _ri_. Up. III, 5,\n2), denies the existence of a seeing and thinking subject different from mere\nseeing and thinking--This view is refuted by the following interpretation. The\ntext addresses itself to a person who has formed the erroneous opinion that\nthe quality of consciousness or knowledge does not constitute the essential\n\np. 84\n\nnature of the knower, but belongs to it only as an adventitious attribute, and\ntells him \'Do not view or think the Self to be such, but consider the seeing\nand thinking Self to have seeing and thinking for its essential nature.\'--Or\nelse this text may mean that the embodied Self which is the seer of seeing and\nthe thinker of thinking should be set aside, and that only the highest Self--\nthe inner Self of all beings--should be meditated upon.--Otherwise a conflict\nwould arise with texts declaring the knowership of the Self, such as \'whereby\nshould he know the knower?\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15).\n\nYour assertion that the text \'Bliss is Brahman\' (Taitt. Up. III, 6, 1) proves\npure Bliss to constitute the essential nature of Brahman is already disposed\nof by the refutation of the view that knowledge (consciousness) constitutes\nthe essential nature of Brahman; Brahman being in reality the substrate only\nof knowledge. For by bliss we understand a pleasing state of consciousness.\nSuch passages as \'consciousness, bliss is Brahman,\' therefore mean\n\'consciousness--the essential character of which is bliss--is Brahman.\' On\nthis identity of the two things there rests that homogeneous character of\nBrahman, so much insisted upon by yourself. And in the same way as numerous\npassages teach that Brahman, while having knowledge for its essential nature,\nis at the same time a knowing subject; so other passages, speaking of Brahman\nas something separate from mere bliss, show it to be not mere bliss but a\nsubject enjoying bliss; cp. \'That is one bliss of Brahman\' (Taitt. Up. II, 8,\n4); \'he knowing the bliss of Brahman\' (Taitt. Up. II, 9, 1). To be a subject\nenjoying bliss is in fact the same as to be a conscious subject.\n\nWe now turn to the numerous texts which, according to the view of our\nopponent, negative the existence of plurality.--\'Where there is duality as it\nwere\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15); \'There is not any plurality here; from death to\ndeath goes he who sees here any plurality\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 19); \'But when\nfor him the Self alone has become all, by what means, and whom, should he\nsee?\' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15) &c.--But what all these texts deny is only\nplurality in so far as contradicting that unity of the world which depends on\nits\n\np. 85\n\nbeing in its entirety an effect of Brahman, and having Brahman for its inward\nruling principle and its true Self. They do not, on the other hand, deny that\nplurality on Brahman\'s part which depends on its intention to become manifold\n--a plurality proved by the text \'May I be many, may I grow forth\' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVI, 2, 3). Nor can our opponent urge against this that, owing to the denial of\nplurality contained in other passages this last text refers to something not\nreal; for it is an altogether laughable assertion that Scripture should at\nfirst teach the doctrine, difficult to comprehend, that plurality as suggested\nby Perception and the other means of Knowledge belongs to Brahman also, and\nshould afterwards negative this very doctrine!\n\nNor is it true that the text \'If he makes but the smallest "antaram" (i.e.\ndifference, interval, break) in it there is fear for him\' (Taitt. Up. II, 7)\nimplies that he who sees plurality within Brahman encounters fear. For the\nother text \'All this is Brahman; let a man meditate with calm mind on all this\nas beginning, ending and breathing in it, i.e. Brahman\' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14,\n1) teaches directly that reflection on the plurality of Brahman is the cause\nof peace of mind. For this passage declares that peace of mind is produced by\na reflection on the entire world as springing from, abiding within, and being\nabsorbed into Brahman, and thus having Brahman for its Self; and as thus the\nview of Brahman constituting the Self of the world with all its manifold\ndistinctions of gods, men, animals, inanimate matter and so on, is said to be\nthe cause of peace of mind, and, consequently, of absence of fear, that same\nview surely cannot be a _cause_ of fear!--But how then is it that the Taitt.\ntext declares that \'there is fear for him\'?--That text, we reply, declares in\nits earlier part that rest in Brahman is the cause of fearlessness (\'when he\nfinds freedom from fear, rest, in that which is invisible, incorporeal,\nundefined, unsupported; then he has obtained fearlessness\'); its latter part\ntherefore means that fear takes place when there is an interval, a break, in\nthis resting in Brahman. As the great _Ri_ shi says \'When Vasudeva is not\nmeditated on for\n\np. 86\n\nan hour or even a moment only; that is loss, that is great calamity, that is\nerror, that is change.\'\n\nThe Sutra III, 2, ii does not, as our opponent alleges, refer to a Brahman\nfree from all difference, but to Brahman as possessing attributes--as we shall\nshow in its place. And the Sutra IV, 2, 3 declares that the things seen in\ndreams are mere \'Maya\' because they differ in character from the things\nperceived in the waking state; from which it follows that the latter things\nare real.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[82:1](sbe48026.htm#fr_14) Which passage appears to refer to a nirgu _n_ a\nbrahman, whence it might be inferred that the connected initial\npassage--\'Satyam _g \xc3\xb1_anam,\' &c.--has a similar purport.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Nor do Smriti and Purana teach such a doctrine](sbe48027.htm)\n\n'
