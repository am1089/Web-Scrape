After travelling from Muttra some days in his\nruth, he reached Hustinapoor; and, on arrival there, went to the court of the\nRaja Doorjodhun, who was sitting on his throne, and, having made a salutation,\nstood before him. On seeing him, Doorjodhun arose with all his court, and\nembraced him; and seating him with great dignity and respect near him, made\nvarious enquiries, saying, "Happy are Soorsen and Basoodeo! happy Krishnu and\nBuldeo! Oogursen has been made a Raja by them, and on their account does not\nthink of any one; since his son\'s death he has reigned and is independent of\nevery one."\n\nWhen Doorjodhun had thus spoken, Akroor was silent, and began to reflect,\n"That this was a court of wicked men, where it was not right for him to\nremain: because if he staid there, they would make many more such speeches, to\nwhich he could not with propriety listen; and, therefore, he ought not to\nremain there."\n\nWith these thoughts in his mind, Akroor Jee arose, and went thence to the\nhouse of Pandoo, accompanied by Bidoor.\n\np. 188\n\n[paragraph continues] On arrival there he beheld Koontee in great affliction\nat the loss of her husband, and shedding tears. He went and sat by her side,\nand said to her, "Mother! no one has power over Bruhmu; and no one is\nimmortal, and lives for ever. Whilst in the body, the soul suffers pain and\npleasure; for which reason it is not becoming in man to grieve and be anxious,\nbecause nothing is gained by indulging in grief; the mind only is afflicted by\nit."\n\nWhen, O great king! Akroor Jee had thus reasoned with Koontee, she reflected\nupon what he had said, and remained silent; and then enquired from Akroor,\n"Whether her mother, father, her brother, Basoodeo, and his relations were all\nwell; and whether Shree Krishnu and Bulram ever thought of their five\nbrothers, Bheem, Joodisthur, Urjoon, Nukool and Suhdeo. They are here fallen\ninto a sea of trouble; and when will they come to their assistance and rescue?\nWe cannot endure the tyranny of the blind Dritrasht; because he acts by the\nadvice of Doorjodhun, and is day and night planning to destroy the five\nbrothers. He has frequently mixed poison for them, which my Bheemsen once\ndrank." Koontee afterwards added, "O Akroor Jee! since all the members of the\nfamily of Kooroo are such great enemies, to whom are my children to look with\naffection, and how shall they grow up, and escape death? How shall I explain\nto you the great afflictions I endure? And as a doe, separated from the herd,\nis greatly alarmed, in like manner I am constantly disquieted and sad. They\nare my protectors, who have destroyed Kuns and all evil spirits. Go and tell\nthem of the griefs of their brothers, Judisthur, Urjoon and Bheem."\n\nAkroor\'s eyes filled with tears at hearing these words of Koontee, spoken with\ngreat humility; and he reasoned with her and said, "Mother! banish all\nanxiety, these five sons of yours will be very powerful and celebrated. They\nwill utterly destroy their enemies, and all wicked persons as Shree Gobind is\ntheir ally." Again Akroor Jee said, "Shree\n\np. 189\n\n[paragraph continues] Krishnu and Bulram sent me here with this message, \'Tell\nour aunt not to vex or fret herself, as we will soon come to her.\'"\n\nO great king! having thus delivered Shree Krishnu\'s message, Akroor Jee\nentered into explanations with Koontee, and restored her to confidence and\ncomposure; and, taking leave went to Dritrasht, accompanied by Bidoor, and\nsaid to him, "Why do you, who are an old man, exercise such tyranny; and being\nunder the influence of your son, make your nephews (brothers\' children)\nunhappy, after having forcibly seized upon the government of your brother?\nAccording to what code are you guilty of such injustice. You have lost your\nsight, but can you not see with the eyes of your mind, your family is being\ndestroyed by your crimes. Why did you, when you were enjoying great ease and\nhappiness, seize upon the government of your brother, and bring distress upon\nBheem and Joodisthur?"\n\nOn hearing these words, Dritrasht laid hold of Akroor\'s hand, said, "What can\nI do, no one will obey my orders? All follow their own counsel, and I am\nlooked upon as a fool by them. For this reason I never take part in their\naffairs; but remain apart, and worship my lord in silence."\n\nWhen Dritrasht had thus spoken, Akroor Jee made a salutation, and rising went\nthence in his ruth; and departing from Hustinapoor came to the city of Muttra.\nHe mentioned to Oogursen and Basoodeo the affairs of the Panduries, the sons\nof Koontee are greatly afflicted, and their bodies much emaciated with grief.\nHaving told Oogursen and Basoodeo Jee all the news of Hustinapoor, Akroor went\nto Shree Krishnu and Bulram; and, making a salutation, said with joined hands,\n"O great king! I have been to Hustinapoor, and seen that your aunt and five\nbrothers suffer great calamities at the hands of the Kooruvus. What more need\nI say, you know the secrets of the heart, and the state of affairs there; and\nthe ruin which has befallen your family, are not hidden from you."\n\np. 190\n\nHaving thus spoken, and delivered Koontee\'s message, Akroor Jee took leave,\nand returned home. And having heard all the intelligence which Akroor brought\nfrom Hustinapoor, Shree Krishnu and Buldeo, the gods of all the gods, sat down\nafter the fashion of men, and engaged in thought, revolved in their minds, how\nthey might remove the burthens of the world.\n\nShree Shookdeo, the sage, having recited thus much of the history to the Raja\nPureechit, said,--O lord of the earth! I have related the first half of\nhistory, comprising what took place in the forest of Bruj and at Muttra, I\nwill now relate the last half, if I obtain the power of the lord of Dwarka.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LI](psa52.htm)\n\n'
