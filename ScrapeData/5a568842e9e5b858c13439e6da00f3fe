Should it be said, not in the night; we say, no; because the connexion\npersists as long as the body does. Scripture also declares this.\n\nIt is now enquired into whether the soul of him who, while having true\nknowledge, dies at night reaches Brahman or not. Although, as solar rays exist\nat night, the soul may move on at night also following those rays; yet, since\ndying at night is spoken of in the Sutras as highly objectionable, we conclude\nthat he who dies at night cannot accomplish the highest end of man, viz.\nattainment to Brahman. The Sutras eulogize death occurring in daytime and\nobject to death at night-time: 'Day-time, the bright half of the month and the\nnorthern progress of the sun are excellent for those about to die; the\ncontrary times are unfavourable.' According to this, their different nature,\ndying in day-time may be assumed to lead to a superior state of existence, and\ndying at night to an inferior state. He who dies at night cannot therefore\nascend to Brahman.--This view the Sutra refutes: 'Because, in the case of him\nwho knows, the connexion with works exists as long as the body does.' This is\nto say--since those works which have not yet begun to produce their results\nand which are the cause of future inferior states of existence are destroyed\nby the contact with knowledge, while at the same time later works do not\n\np. 741\n\n[paragraph continues] 'cling' (also owing to the presence of true knowledge),\nand those works which have begun to act come to an end with the existence of\nthe last body; there is no reason why he who knows should remain in bondage,\nand hence he reaches Brahman even if dying at night-time. Scripture also\ndeclares this, 'for him there is delay only as long as he is not freed from\nthe body, then he will be united.' The text which praises the advantages of\nnight-time, the light half of the month, &c., therefore must be understood as\nreferring to those who do not possess true knowledge.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'night.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 19.
