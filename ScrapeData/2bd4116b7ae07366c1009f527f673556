Now, after washing his hands, he shall take his waterpot and a clod of\nearth, go to a (sacred) bathing-place and thrice clean his feet (with earth\nand water) and thrice his body. 1\n\n2\\. Now some say, 'One must not enter a burial-ground, water, a temple, a\ncowpen, nor a place where Brahma _n_ as (sit) without having cleaned one's\nfeet.'\n\np. 250\n\n3\\. Then he enters the water, (reciting the following verse): 'I take refuge\nwith gold-horned Varu _n_ a, give me at my request (O Varu _n_ a) a purifying\nbathing-place. May Indra, Varu _n_ a, B _ri_ haspati, and Savit _ri_ again and\nagain cleanse me from all sin which I have committed by eating the food of\nunholy men, by receiving gifts from the wicked, and from all evil which I have\ndone by thoughts, speeches, or deeds.' 3\n\n4\\. Then he takes up water in his joined hands, (saying), 'May the waters and\nthe herbs be propitious to us.' 4\n\n5\\. (Next) he pours (the water) out in that direction in which an enemy of his\ndwells, (saying), 'May they work woe to him who hates us and whom we hate.' 5\n\n6\\. Then he sips water, and thrice makes the water eddy around himself turning\nfrom the left to the right (and saying), 'May that which is hurtful, which is\nimpure, and which is inauspicious in the water be removed.' 6\n\n7\\. After having submerged himself and having emerged from the water, 7\n\n8\\. (Acts of) personal purification, washing the clothes by beating them on a\nstone and sipping 8\n\np. 251\n\nwater are not (permitted to the worshipper) as long as he is in the water.\n\n9\\. If (the water used for bathing) has been (taken from a) confined (place,\nsuch as a well), he worships it with the following (Mantra): 'Adoration to\nAgni, the lord of the waters; adoration to Indra; adoration to Varu _n_ a;\nadoration to Varu _n_ i; adoration to the waters.' 9\n\n10\\. After having ascended the bank and having sipped water, let him again sip\nwater, though he has done so before, (and recite the following Mantras) 'May\nwater purify the earth, may the purified earth purify me, may Brahma _n_\naspati (and) Brahman purify, may the purified (earth) purify me. May water\npurify me, (taking away) all (the guilt which I incurred by eating) remnants\nof food, and forbidden food, (by committing) evil deeds, (by) receiving gifts\nfrom wicked men, Svaha!' 10\n\n11\\. Making two Pavitras he rubs (his body) with water. Having rubbed himself,\n(reciting the) three (verses), 'Ye waters are,' &c., the four (verses), 'The\ngolden-coloured, pure, purifying,' &c., (and) the Anuvaka, 'He who purifies,'\n&c., he performs, stepping back into the water, three Pra _n_ ayamas with the\nAghamarsha _n_ a (hymn); then he ascends the bank, squeezes (the water) out of\nhis dress, puts on garments which have been washed and dried in the air and\nwhich are not the worse for wear, sips water, 11\n\np. 252\n\nsits down on Darbha grass, and, holding Darbha grass (in his hands), recites,\nfacing the east, the Gayatri one thousand times, (or) one hundred times, or\nany number of times, or at least twelve times.\n\n12\\. Then he worships the sun (reciting the following Mantras): 'Out of\ndarkness we,' &c., 'Up that bright,' &c., That eye which is beneficial to the\ngods,' &c., (and) 'He who rose,' &c. 12\n\n13\\. Now they quote also (the following maxim): 'The syllable Om,, the Vyah\n_ri_ tis, and the Savitri, these five Veda-offerings daily cleanse the Brahma\n_n_ a from guilt.'\n\n14\\. Being purified by the five Veda-offerings, he next satiates the gods\n(with water, saying), 14\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[249:1](sbe1462.htm#fr_1226) **8**. Vish _n_ u LXIV, 18. This Adhyaya contains\nthe rules for bathing, and the subject is introduced, as Govinda observes,\nbecause in the preceding chapter II, 4, 7, 2, it has been said that an impure\nperson must bathe before he performs the twilight devotions. Govinda also\nstates that the word _k_ a, 'and,' which stands after m _ri_ tpi _n_ _d_ am,\n'a clod,' indicates that gomaya, 'cowdung,' must also be employed.\n\n[250:3](sbe1462.htm#fr_1227) The verse is found Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 1,\n12,\n\n[250:4](sbe1462.htm#fr_1228) Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 1, 11.\n\n[250:5](sbe1462.htm#fr_1229) Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, loc. cit.

He adds that Baudhayana inserted Sutras 8-9\nin the middle, because he was afraid to forget the rules contained in them.\n\n[250:8](sbe1462.htm#fr_1232) Vish _n_ u LXIV, 10, 11.\n\n[251:9](sbe1462.htm#fr_1233) Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 1, 12.\n\n[251:10](sbe1462.htm#fr_1234) Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 23.
