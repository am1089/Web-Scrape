Expiatory charm for a child born under an unlucky star.\n\n1\\. Of yore, (O Agni), thou wast worthy of supplication at the sacrifice; thou\nwast the priest in olden times, and now anew shalt sit (at our sacrifice)!\nDelight, O Agni, thy own body, and, sacrificing, bring good fortune here to\nus!  \n2\\. Him that hath been born under the (constellation) gyeshihaghni ('she that\nslays the oldest'), or under the vikritau ('they that uproot'), save thou from\nbeing torn up by the root by Yama (death)! May be (Agni) guide him across all\nmisfortunes to long life, to a life of a hundred autumns!  \n3\\. On a tiger (-like) day the hero was born; born under a (good)\nconstellation he becometh a mighty hero. Let him not slay, when he grows up,\nhis father, let him not injure the mother that hath begotten him!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 140.
