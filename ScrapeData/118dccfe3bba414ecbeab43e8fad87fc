Naraya _n_ a said :-- Beyond the Saptar _s_ i ma _nd_ alam (the Great\nBear), thirteen lakh Yojanas higher is situated, the Vi _sn_ u\xc2\x92s Paramam Padam\n(the highest place of Vi _sn_ u). The Great Bhagavat (devotee of God), the\nmost respectful, S\xc2\x92riman Dhruva, the son of Uttanapada, is established there\nwith Indra, Ag _n_ i, Kas\xc2\x92yapa and Dharma and the Nak _s_ attras. The visitors\npay to him always their respects. He is the patron of those who live till the\nend of a Kalpa. He is engaged in serving the lotus-feet of the Bhagavan. He\nhas been made by God Himself the pillar round whom all the planets, stars, and\nthe luminary bodies are revolving always and with great force in the Zodiac\nand in the celestial Heavens. The Devas also worship him. He, resplendent in\nhis own glory, illumines and manifests all. As beasts tied to yoke go on\ntilling, so the planets and stars, fixed on the Zodiac, go quickly round and\nround this Dhruva, the Pole Star; some nearer, some further distant in\nspheres, propelled by Vayu. As the hawks hover round the sky, so the above-\nmentioned planets, go completely round and round under their own Karmas and\ncontrolled by the Vayu in the sky. Thus all the luminaries do not fall to the\nground, as they are kept up in their respective positions by the favour of the\nunion of Prakriti and Puru _s_ a. Some say that this Jyoti _s_ chakra, the\ncelestial Heavens (the Zodiac) is S\xc2\x92is\xc2\x92umara. It is kept duly in its position\nfor the purpose of holding things up by the power of the Bhagavan. Hence it\ndoes not fall. It is resting with its body coiled round and with its head\nlower down. O Muni! Dhruva, the son of Uttanapada is staying at the tail end.\nAnd, in addition to him, also at the tail rests Brahma, the Sinless Prajapati,\nworshipped by the Gods, Ag _n_ i, Indra and Dharma. Thus the creation is at\nthe tail and the Saptar _s_ ima _nd_ al is staying at his waist. Thus the\ncelestial wheel (Jyoti _s_ chakra) is resting with his coils turned in a\nright-hand direction. On his right side are found the Uttaraya _n_ a Nak _s_\nattras, fourteen in number from Abhijit to Punarvasu and on his left side are\nfound the other fourteen Dak _s_ i _n_ ayanam Nak _s_ attras from Pu _s_ ya to\nUttara _s_ a _d_ ha. O Son of Brahma! Thus the Nak _s_ attras form the coil-\nshaped body of the S\xc2\x92is\xc2\x92umara, the Zodiac; half the Nak _s_ attras\n\n\n\np. 779\n\n\n\non the one side and the other half Nak _s_ attras on the other. His back is on\nthe Heavenly Ganges named Ajavithi. Punarvasu and Pu _s_ ya form the right and\nleft side of the loins; \xc3\x82rdra and As\xc2\x92les\xc2\x92a form the right and left feet\n(westward); Abhijit and Uttara _s_ a _d_ ha form the right and left nostrils.\nO Devar _s_ i! S\xc2\x92rava _n_ a and Purva _s_ a _d_ ha form the right and left\neyes respectively; so say the persons that form the Kalpanas (fancies). Dhani\n_st_ ha and Mula form his right and left ears; Magha, etc., the eight Dak _s_\ni _n_ ayanam Nak _s_ attras form the bones on the left side. O Muni! Mrigasir\n_s_ a, the Uttaraya _n_ a Nak _s_ attras form the bones on his right side,\nS\xc2\x92atabhi _s_ a and Jye _st_ ha form the right and left shoulders. Agasti (the\nCanopus) forms the upper jaw and Yama, the lower jaw. The planet Mars forms\nhis face; Saturn forms his organ of generation; Brihaspati forms the hump on\nthe shoulders; the Sun, the Lord of the planets, forms his breast; Naraya _n_\na remains in the heart; and the Moon is in his mind. (Note :-- S\xc2\x92is\xc2\x92umara is\nalso the constellation Dolphinus and is sometimes meant for the polar star.) O\nNarada! The two As\xc2\x92vins form the nipples on his breast; Us\xc2\x92ana forms his\nnavel; the Mercury is his Pra _n_ a and Apana; Rahu is his neck and Ketu is\nall over his body and the stars are reigning all over the hairs of his body.\nThis Zodiac is the body composed of the Devas of that All Pervading Bhagavan.\nSo every intelligent person should daily meditate this S\xc2\x92is\xc2\x92umara in the\nSandhya time, with perfect purity and keeping himself Mauna (silent), and with\nhis whole heart. Then he should repeat the following mantras and get up and\nsay :-- \xc2\x93Thou art the Substratum of all the luminaries, we bow down to Thee;\nThou createst and destroyest all. Thou art the Lord of all the celestials.\nThou art the \xc3\x82dipuru _s_ a, the foremost of all the Puru _s_ as; we meditate\nfully on Thee. The planets, Nak _s_ attras, and the stars are Thy body. The\nDaiva is established in Thee alone. Thou destroyest the sins of those that\ncompose the Mantras. The sins are completely destroyed for the time being of\nhim who bows down or remembers Thee in the morning, afternoon and evening.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Seventeenth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the Dhruva Ma _nd_\nalam in the Maha Pura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses, by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 18](bk08ch18.htm)\n\n"
