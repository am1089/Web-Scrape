C., embraced\nthe [Buddhist](errata.htm#28) religion, and spread it over India and far\nbeyond the limits of India. "If a man\'s fame," says Kopen, "can be measured,\nby the number of lips that have mentioned and still mention him with honor,\nAsoka is more famous than Charlemagne or Caesar."\n\nThus spake royal Piyadasi,  \n     Of the Gods beloved;  \n"Grace and righteous exhortation  \n     Have my subjects moved. p. 186  \nFor my pastors to the people  \n     Holy lessons sing,--  \nAnd my priests to countless thousands  \n     Loving message bring!\n\nI have spoke to subject peoples,  \n     Precepts I have loved;  \nI have carved on rock-made pillars,  \n     Lessons I have proved.  \nMinisters of faith and duty  \n     Have my mandates told;  \nSpoke to near and distant nations,  \n     Maxims, loved of old!\n\nAnd within my spacious empire,  \n     By each highway made,  \nFigs and mangoes I have planted,  \n     For repose and shade;  \nWells I made, for man and cattle,  \n     All that breathe and move,--  \nBut with higher toil constructed  \n     Springs of faith and love!\n\nScatter then my royal riches,  \n     Spread my bounty, then,  \nTo the monk and to the toiler,--  \n     To all living men,  \nTo the Brahman and the Sharman,--  \n     To all sects of fame;  \nLet each clan and corporation  \n     Know Asoka\'s name!\n\nAnd unto my royal bounty,  \n     Others add their store,  \nFor my queens, with queenly mercy,  \n     Help the helpless poor;  \nAnd my white-robed, royal children,  \n     Acts of kindness prove,  \nCharity and Truth and Kindness,  \n     Purity and Love! p. 187\n\nThus, in ever-growing current,  \n     May our bounty flow,  \nTo the Brahman and the Sharma,--  \n     To the poor and low:  \nFor the humble and the lowly,  \n     Special kindness crave!  \nMay our mercy reach the menial,  \n     Cheer the unchained slave!\n\nLaws severe, we vainly fashion,  \n     Codes we vainly start;  \nGentle teaching, soft persuasion,  \n     Touch the people\'s heart.  \nHence, I carve this loving edict,  \n     Speak these maxims, pure,--  \nFuture [kings](errata.htm#29) shall work as long as  \n     Sun and moon endure!\n\nSince I won my father\'s empire,--  \n     Since this state was mine,  \nPast are seven and twenty autumns  \n     When I carve this line.  \nWhere \'tis writ on stony pillar,  \n     In this empire, vast,  \nUnto far and distant ages  \n     May this Edict last!"  \n                       Pillar Edict, [viii](errata.htm#30).\n\n#### ASOKA\'S MESSAGE TO FOREIGN NATIONS\n\nKing and Victor Piyadasi,  \n     Of the Gods beloved,  \nO\'er the plains of broad Kalinga,  \n     With his army moved.  \nHundred thousand men were taken,--  \n     Hundred thousand died;  \nRighteous sorrow wrung his bosom,  \nAnd the Victor cried; p. 188\n\n\'Brahmans pure and Sharmans holy,--  \n     Men who toil in life,  \nFaithful fathers, loving children,--  \n     Husband and the wife;  \nThese to pain and separation,  \n     Slavery and death,  \nI have doomed, and swept Kalinga  \nWith destruction\'s breath!\n\nLet me seek for other trophies,  \n     Win the spoils of faith;  \nPeace and plenty, not disaster;.  \n     Life and love, not death!  \nSpeak then to my farthest frontiers,  \n     To each distant soil:\'  \n\'Warfare ends, the work of mercy,  \n     Henceforth is my toil!\n\nSyria\'s monarch, Antiochus,--  \n     Egypt\'s Ptolemy,--  \nMacedonian Antigonas,--  \n     Cyrenean Magas, free,--  \nAlexander of Epiros,--  \n     These five kings of West,  \nHave received my loving message,--  \n     Gospel true and blest!\n\nCholas and the mighty Pandyas,--  \n     Tamba-pannis, meek;  \nHenaraja-Vismavasis,  \n     And the Bactrain Greek;  \nNabhakas and Nabha-pantis,--  \n     Bhojas only stirred;  \nAndhras and the brave Pulindas,  \n     Have my tidings heard!\n\nMessengers of Piyadasi  \n     To these lands are sent,--  \nGrateful kings and listening nations p. 189  \n     To his faith have bent;  \nThus I win a brighter conquest,  \n     And a holier fame;  \nAnd a more than earthly gladness  \n     Thrills my mortal frame!\n\nRich and rare the golden fruitage  \n     Of a life of faith;  \nFull and ample is the harvest  \n     Gathered after death:  \nHence, the monarch Piyadasi.  \n     Carves his sacred line, --  \nThat his royal sons and grandsons  \n     May to faith incline!\n\nThat the kings of earth, hereafter,  \n     May all conquest shun,  \nWrought by rapine and by bloodshed,  \n     Deeds of darkness done.  \nThat the monarchs may, hereafter,  \n     Conquer realms by faith;  \nFame on earth awaits such conquest,  \n     Glory after death!"  \n             \n\nFrom the Translation of R. C. Dutt.\n\nNote by Author--A workable scheme for the League of Nations.\n\nThe night approaches now; hold fast  \n     The lamp of holy knowledge, bright  \nWith ever slowly kindling light,  \n     To guide thee till the gloom is past.  \n  \n                 Mahabharata xii. 12064\n\nOm!
