If a man wishes to reach greatness (wealth for performing sacrifices), he\nperforms the upasad rule during twelve days 3 (i. e. he lives on small\nquantities of milk), beginning on an auspicious day of the light half of the\nmoon during the northern progress of the sun, collecting at the same time in a\ncup or a dish\n\np. 210\n\nmade of Udumbara wood all sorts of herbs, including fruits. He sweeps the\nfloor (near the house-altar, avasathya), sprinkles it, lays the fire, spreads\ngrass round it according to rule 1, prepares the clarified butter (a _g_ ya),\nand on a day, presided over by a male star (nakshatra), after having properly\nmixed the Mantha 2 (the herbs, fruits, milk, honey, &c.), he sacrifices (he\npours a _g_ ya into the fire), saying 3: 'O _G_ atavedas, whatever adverse\ngods there are in thee, who defeat the desires of men, to them I offer this\nportion; may they, being pleased, please me with all desires.' Svaha!\n\n'That cross deity who lies down 4, thinking that all things are kept asunder\nby her, I worship thee as propitious with this stream of ghee.' Svaha!\n\n2\\. He then says, Svaha to the First, Svaha to the Best, pours ghee into the\nfire, and throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Svaha to Breath, Svaha to her who is the richest, pours ghee\ninto the fire, and throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Svaha to Speech, Svaha to the Support, pours ghee into the fire,\nand throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Svaha to the Eye, Svaha to Success, pours ghee into the fire,\nand throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Svaha to the Ear, Svaha to the\n\np. 211\n\n[paragraph continues] Home, pours ghee into the fire, and throws what remains\ninto the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Svaha to the Mind, Svaha to Offspring, pours ghee into the fire,\nand throws what remains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Svaha to Seed, pours ghee into the fire, and throws what remains\ninto the Mantha (mortar).\n\n3\\. He then says, Svaha to Agni (fire), pours ghee into the fire, and throws\nwhat remains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Svaha to Soma, pours ghee into the fire, and throws what remains\ninto the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Bhu _h_ (earth), Svaha, pours ghee into the fire, and throws\nwhat remains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Bhuva _h_ (sky), Svaha, pours ghee into the fire, and throws\nwhat remains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Sva _h_ (heaven), Svaha, pours ghee into the fire, and throws\nwhat remains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Bhur, Bhuva _h_ , Sva _h_ , Svaha, pours ghee into the fire, and\nthrows what remains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Svaha to Brahman (the priesthood), pours ghee into the fire, and\nthrows what remains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Svaha to Kshatra (the knighthood), pours ghee into the fire, and\nthrows what remains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Svaha to the Past, pours ghee into the fire, and throws what\nremains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\np. 212\n\nHe then says, Svaha to the Future, pours ghee into the fire, and throws what\nremains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Svaha to the Universe, pours ghee into the fire, and throws what\nremains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Svaha to all things, pours ghee into the fire, and throws what\nremains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\nHe then says, Svaha to Pra _g_ apati, pours ghee into the fire, and throws\nwhat remains into the Mantha (mortar).\n\n4\\. Then he touches it (the Mantha, which is dedicated to Pra _n_ a, breath),\nsaying: 'Thou art fleet (as breath). Thou art burning (as fire). Thou art full\n(as Brahman). Thou art firm (as the sky). Thou art the abode of all (as the\nearth). Thou hast been saluted with Hi\xe1\xb9\x85 (at the beginning of the sacrifice by\nthe prastot _ri_ ). Thou art saluted with Hi\xe1\xb9\x85 (in the middle of the sacrifice\nby the prastot _ri_ ). Thou hast been sung (by the udgat _ri_ at the beginning\nof the sacrifice). Thou art sung (by the udgat _ri_ in the middle of the\nsacrifice). Thou hast been celebrated (by the adhvaryu at the beginning of the\nsacrifice). Thou art celebrated again (by the agnidhra in the middle of the\nsacrifice). Thou art bright in the wet (cloud). Thou art great. Thou art\npowerful. Thou art food (as Soma). Thou art light (as Agni, fire, the eater).\nThou art the end. Thou art the absorption (of all things).'\n\n5\\. Then he holds it (the Mantha) forth, saying\n\n'Thou 1 knowest all, we know thy greatness. He is\n\np. 213\n\nindeed a king, a ruler, the highest lord. May that king, that ruler make me\nthe highest lord.'\n\n6\\. Then he eats it, saying: 'Tat savitur vare _n_ yam 1 (We meditate on that\nadorable light)--The winds drop honey for the righteous, the rivers drop\nhoney, may our plants be sweet as honey! Bhu _h_ (earth) Svaha!\n\n'Bhargo devasya dhimahi (of the divine Savit _ri_ )--May the night be honey in\nthe morning, may the air above the earth, may heaven, our father, be honey!\nBhuva _h_ (sky) Svaha!'\n\n'Dhiyo yo nah pro _k_ odayat (who should rouse our thoughts)--May the tree be\nfull of honey, may the sun be full of honey, may our cows be sweet like honey!\nSva _h_ (heaven) Svaha!'\n\nHe repeats the whole Savitri verse, and all the verses about the honey,\nthinking, May I be all this! Bhur, Bhuva _h_ , Sva _h_ , Svaha! Having thus\nswallowed all, he washes his hands, and sits down behind the altar, turning\nhis head to the East. In the morning he worships \xc3\x82ditya (the sun), with the\nhymn, 'Thou art the best lotus of the four quarters, may I become the best\nlotus among men.' Then returning as he came, he sits down behind the altar and\nrecites the genealogical list 2.\n\n7\\. Uddalaka \xc3\x82runi told this (Mantha-doctrine) to his pupil Va _g_ asaneya Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, and said: 'If a man were to pour it on a dry stick, branches\nwould grow, and leaves spring forth.'\n\np. 214\n\n8\\. Va _g_ asaneya Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya told the same to his pupil Madhuka\nPai\xe1\xb9\x85gya, and said: 'If a man were to pour it on a dry stick, branches would\ngrow, and leaves spring forth.'\n\n9\\. Madhuka Pai\xe1\xb9\x85gya told the same to his pupil _K_ ula Bhagavitti, and said:\n'If a man were to pour it on a dry stick, branches would grow, and leaves\nspring forth.'\n\n10\\. _K_ ula Bhagavitti told the same to his pupil _G_ anaki \xc3\x82yasthu _n_ a,\nand said: 'If a man were to pour it on a dry stick, branches would grow, and\nleaves spring forth.'\n\n11\\. _G_ anaki \xc3\x82yasthu _n_ a told the same to his pupil Satyakama _G_ abala,\nand said: 'If a man were to pour it on a dry stick, branches would grow, and\nleaves spring forth.'\n\n12\\. Satyakama _G_ abala told the same to his pupils, and said: 'If a man were\nto pour it on a dry stick, branches would grow, and leaves spring forth.'\n\nLet no one tell this 1 to any one, except to a son or to a pupil 2.\n\n13\\. Four things are made of the wood of the Udumbara tree, the sacrificial\nladle (sruva), the cup ( _k_ amasa), the fuel, and the two churning sticks.\n\nThere are ten kinds of village (cultivated) seeds, viz. rice and barley\n(brihiyavas), sesamum and kidney-beans (tilamashas), millet and panic seed (a\n_n_ upriya\xe1\xb9\x85gavas), wheat (godhumas), lentils (masuras), pulse (khalvas), and\nvetches (khalakulas 3) . After having\n\np. 215\n\nground these he sprinkles them with curds (dadhi), honey, and ghee, and then\noffers (the proper portions) of clarified butter [1](sbe15097.htm#fn_622) (a\n_g_ ya).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[209:2](sbe15096.htm#fr_610) Madhyandina text, p. 1103; cf. _Kh_ and. Up. V,\n2, 4-8; Kaush. Up. II, 3.\n\n[209:3](sbe15096.htm#fr_611) Yasmin pu _n_ ye 'nukule 'hni karma _k_ ikirshati\ntata _h_ prak pu _n_ yaham evarabhya dvada _s_ aham upasadvrati.\n\n[210:1](sbe15096.htm#fr_612) As the whole act is considered smarta, not _s_\nrauta, the order to be observed (av _ri_ t) is that of the sthalipaka.\n\n[210:2](sbe15096.htm#fr_613) Dravadravye prakshipta mathita _h_ saktava _h_ is\nthe explanation of Mantha, given in _G_ aimin. N. M. V. p. 406.\n\n[210:3](sbe15096.htm#fr_614) These verses are not explained by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, and\nthey are absent in the _Kh_ and. Up. V, 2, 6, 4.\n\n[210:4](sbe15096.htm#fr_615) The Madhyandinas read nipadyase.\n\n[212:1](sbe15096.htm#fr_616) These curious words a ma _m_ si a ma _m_ hi te\nmahi are not explained by _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara. \xc3\x82nandagiri explains them as I have\ntranslated p. 213 them. They correspond to 'amo, namasy ama hi te sarvam idam'\nin the _Kh_ and. Up. V, 2, 6, 6. The Madhyandinas read: 'amo 'sy ama _m_ hi te\nmayi, sa hi ra _g_ a, &c. Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga translates: thou art the knower, thy\nknowledge extends to me.'\n\n[213:1](sbe15096.htm#fr_617) Rv. III, 62, 10.\n\n[213:2](sbe15096.htm#fr_618) This probably refers to the list immediately\nfollowing.\n\n[214:1](sbe15096.htm#fr_619) The Mantha-doctrine with the pra _n_ adar _s_\nana. Comm.\n\n[214:2](sbe15096.htm#fr_620) It probably means to no one except to one's own\nson and to one's own disciple. Cf. _S_ vet. Up. VI, 22.\n\n[214:3](sbe15096.htm#fr_621) I have given the English names after Roer, who,\nliving in India, had the best opportunity of identifying the various kinds of\nplants here mentioned. The commentators do not help us much. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara p. 215\nsays that in some places Priya\xe1\xb9\x85gu (panic seed or millet) is called Ka\xe1\xb9\x85gu; that\nKhalva, pulse, is also called Nishpava and Valla, and Khalakula, vetches,\ncommonly Kulattha. Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga adds that A _n_ u is called in Guzerat Moriya,\nPriya\xe1\xb9\x85gu Ka\xe1\xb9\x85gu, Khalva, as nishpava, Valla, and Khalakula Kulattha.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 4](sbe15097.htm)\n\n"
