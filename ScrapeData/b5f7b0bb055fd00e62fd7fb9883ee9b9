THE V\xc4\x80MANA OR DWARF AVAT\xc4\x80RA.\n\nThe four Avat\xc4\x81ras that have already been described are said to have occurred\nin the Satya-yuga, or age of Truth, corresponding with the golden age of\nclassic writers; it was in the Treta-yuga, or second age, that this\nincarnation is supposed to have occurred. It is\n\np. 156\n\nnot easy to see how this belief could be formed; for if the story of Prahl\xc4\x81da\nbe regarded as a true picture of the Satya-yuga, it was not very far superior\nto the present, the last and worst of all.\n\nThis incarnation was undertaken to recover heaven for the gods. Bali, a demon,\ngrandson of Prahl\xc4\x81da whose story has just been given, was king over the three\nworlds--heaven, earth and sky. In the form of a Br\xc4\x81hman dwarf, Vishnu appears,\nand asks, as a gift, all he could cross over in three steps. This the king\ngrants. Immediately the pigmy becomes a giant, and with one step strides over\nheaven, and with the second over the earth, and thus fulfils his purpose. The\n"Skanda Pur\xc4\x81na" * gives the following legend as the reason of this\nincarnation.\n\nIn the battle between the gods and asuras for the possession of the amrita\nproduced at the churning of the ocean, the demons were defeated. Bali prepared\na costly sacrifice in order that he might regain his power. As he presented\nhis offerings to the sacred fire, he obtained from it a wondrous car drawn by\nfour white horses, a banner displaying a lion, and celestial armour and\nweapons. The sacred rites being finished, he raised a large army, and in his\nnewly-acquired chariot went and laid siege to Amravati, the capital of Indra\'s\nheaven. The gods in terror turned to their preceptor for advice. He told them\nthat their enemies had been rendered invincible by penance. On hearing this,\nthey were greatly alarmed, and Indra besought the preceptor, Vrihaspati, to\ntell them what to do. He advised them to forsake Amravati, assume other forms,\nand find a home elsewhere. They obeyed; Indra became a peacock, Kuvera a\nlizard, and the other gods, variously\n\np. 157\n\ndisguised, went to the hermitage of Kasyapa, to whom they related their\nmisfortunes. On hearing their story, the sage desired his wife Aditi to\nperform a severe\n\n[![THE V\xc4\x80MANA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.](tn/15700.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/15700.jpg)  \nTHE V\xc4\x80MANA AVAT\xc4\x80RA.  \n\npenance, in order to induce Vishnu to become her son, that through him the\ngods might be restored to heaven.\n\nAs the origin of this incarnation is probably found in the metaphorical\nlanguage of the Vedas, it will be\n\np. 158\n\nwell to consider the teaching of the Hindu scriptures as far as possible in\nchronological order.\n\nThe legend just quoted from the "Skanda Pur\xc4\x81na" was written as an answer to\nthe question why Vishnu had appeared in this strange form. In the Rig-Veda *\nthe germ of the story is found: "Vishnu strode over this [universe]; in three\nplaces he planted his step." This passage is interpreted by the commentators\nin various ways. One taught "that the triple manifestation of the god in the\nform of fire on earth, of lightning in the atmosphere, and of the solar slight\nin the sky, was intended in this hymn." Another understands the three steps of\nVishnu to represent "the different positions of the sun at his rising, his\nculmination, and his setting." According to this, therefore, Vishnu is simply\nthe sun. Frequently in the Rig-Veda the term "wide-stepping" is applied to\nhim, an evident allusion to his three steps.\n\nIn the "Satapatha Br\xc4\x81hmana," \xe2\x80\xa0 the simple statement of the earlier book\nrespecting Vishnu\'s strides assumes a larger form. " The gods and the asuras,\nwho both sprung from Praj\xc4\x81pati, strove together. Then the gods were worsted;\nand the asuras said, \'This world is now certainly ours! Let us divide the\nearth, and let us subsist thereon.\' The gods heard of it and said, \'The asuras\nare dividing the earth: come, we will go to the spot where they are dividing\nit!\' Placing at their head Vishnu, the sacrifice, they proceeded [thither],\nand said, \'Put us with yourselves in possession of this earth; let us have a\nshare of it.\' The asuras grudgingly said, \'We will give you as much as this\nVishnu can lie upon.\' Now Vishnu was a dwarf. The gods did not reject this\noffer. They placed Agni in the East, and thus they\n\np. 159\n\nwent on toiling and worshipping. By this means they acquired the whole earth."\n\nThe next form of the legend is that of the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana. Visvamitra, a sage,\naddressing R\xc4\x81ma, tells him the story. "Formerly Bali, the son of Virochana,\nafter conquering the chief of the gods, enjoyed the empire of the three\nworlds, intoxicated with the increase of his power. When Bali was celebrating\na sacrifice, Indra and the other gods addressed Vishnu in this hermitage\n[saying], \'That mighty Bali is now performing sacrifice; he who grants the\ndesire of all creatures; the prosperous lord of the asuras. Whatever\nsuppliants wait upon him, he bestows on them whatever [they wish]. Do thou\ntake the form of a dwarf, and bring about our highest welfare.\' [Kasyapa now\nappears, and, after praising Vishnu, asks a boon, that Vishnu will be born as\nthe son of Aditi and himself.] Thus addressed by the gods, Vishnu took the\nform of a dwarf, and, approaching the son of Virochana, begged three of his\nown paces. Having obtained three paces, Vishnu assumed a miraculous form, and\nwith three paces took possession of the world. With one step he occupied the\nwhole earth; with a second, the eternal atmosphere; and with a third, the sky.\nHaving assigned to the asura Bali an abode in P\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81la (the infernal region), he\ngave the empire of the world to Indra."\n\nThe notice of this Avat\xc4\x81ra in the Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata is not lengthy. Vishnu is\nrepresented as foretelling it to N\xc4\x81rada. "The great asura Bali shall be\nindestructible by all beings, including gods, asuras, and R\xc4\x81kshasas. He shall\noust Indra; and when the three worlds have been taken by Bali, and Indra put\nto flight, I shall be born in the form of the twelve \xc4\x80dityas, the son of\nKasyapa and Diti. I will then restore his kingdom to\n\np. 160\n\n[paragraph continues] Indra, reinstate the gods in their several positions,\nand place Bali in P\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81la."\n\nThe "Vishnu Pur\xc4\x81na" barely notices this event, but it is fully described in\nthe Bh\xc4\x81gavata. The question is there asked, "Why did Hari, the lord of\ncreatures, ask, like a poor man, three pieces of land from Bali? And why, when\nhe had obtained his object, did he bind him? And why was an innocent being\nbound by the lord of sacrifice?" The answer given is as follows:--After Bali\nhad been killed by Indra, he was restored by the Br\xc4\x81hmans of the race of\nBhrigu, who consecrated him for supreme dominion, and performed a sacrifice to\nobtain it for him. He then sets out for Amravati, as before narrated; and\nIndra is told, when he applies to his preceptor for advice, that Bali had\nobtained this power "by virtue of the Br\xc4\x81hman\'s sacrifice;" and that, save by\nHari, he is unconquerable. "He now reaps the fruit of Br\xc4\x81hmanical power;\nthrough contempt of these same Br\xc4\x81hmans he shall perish with all his\ndescendants."\n\nThe gods forsake their capital, which is occupied by Bali. Aditi, the mother\nof the gods, is distressed as she sees the condition of her children; and\nacting upon the advice of her husband, propitiates Vishnu, who says: "I shall\nwith a portion of myself become thy son, and deliver thy children. Wait upon\nthy husband, the sinless Praj\xc4\x81pati, virtuous female, meditating upon me, who\nin this form abide within him." Aditi followed the advice of the god; and\nKasyapa knew by meditation that a portion of Hari had entered into him. In due\ntime the son was born, and became a dwarfish Br\xc4\x81hmanical student.\n\nAs the Bhrigus are performing a sacrifice for Bali on the banks of the Narmada\nriver, this dwarf visits Bali at Indra\'s heaven. "Acquainted with his duty,\nBali\n\np. 161\n\nplaced upon his head the auspicious water with which the Br\xc4\x81hman\'s feet had\nbeen washed, and said, \'Welcome to thee, O Br\xc4\x81hman! What can we do for thee?\nAsk of me, student, whatever thou desirest. Son of a Br\xc4\x81hman, I conclude thou\nart a suppliant; ask a cow, pure gold, an embellished house, food and drink, a\nBr\xc4\x81hman\'s daughter, flourishing villages, horses, elephants, and carriages."\nThe dwarf concludes a speech with the semblance of moderation as follows: "I\nask from thee a small portion of ground, three paces measured step by step. I\ndesire no more from thee. A wise man incurs no sin, when he asks [only] as\nmuch as he needs." The king, though astonished at the smallness of the\nrequest, takes a vessel of water in his hand, and is about to confirm the\ngift; when his preceptor, seeing through Vishnu\'s device, tries to dissuade\nhis pupil. In a long speech he seeks to show that rather than be left homeless\nit would be better for him to break his word. But the king persists in\nfulfilling his promise; even though cursed by his preceptor for doing so. With\ntwo steps Vishnu strode over the universe; there was nowhere for him to take a\nthird.\n\nThe gods congratulate Hari; Bali is bound by Garuda and then reproached by\nVishnu for not fulfilling his promise. "Asura, three paces of ground were\ngiven to me by thee; with two paces the entire world has been traversed; find\na place for the third. As thou hast not given what was promised, it is my\npleasure that thou shouldst dwell in the infernal regions. That man falls\ndownward who, after promising a Br\xc4\x81hman, does not deliver to him what he had\nsolicited. I have been deluded by thee." Bali offers his head as a place for\nVishnu\'s foot, saying, "I fear not the infernal regions so much as a bad\nname." Bali goes to P\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81la, and is there\n\np. 162\n\nvisited by his grandfather Prahl\xc4\x81da. First Vishnu\'s wife and then Brahm\xc4\x81\nintercede with him on the demon\'s behalf, who, in reply, promises that Bali\nshall again become Indra; but that in the mean time he must dwell in Sutala,\nwhere "by my will, neither mental nor bodily pains, nor fatigue, nor\nweariness, nor discomfiture, nor diseases afflict the inhabitants." Bali\ngladly left P\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81la, and went to Sutala, to wait until the time came when, in\naccordance with the promise of Vishnu, he should again rule over gods and men.\n\nAnother legend teaches that Vishnu gave Bali the choice of going to heaven,\ntaking with him five ignorant people, or of going to hell with five wise. He\nchose the latter, for there is no pleasure anywhere in the company of the\nignorant; whilst a bad place with good company is enjoyable.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[155:*](hmvp22.htm#fr_154) Ward, ii. 7, 8.\n\n[156:*](hmvp23.htm#fr_155) Kennedy\'s "Hindu Mythology," p. 363.\n\n[158:*](hmvp23.htm#fr_156) Muir, O.
