Charm against takman (fever) and related diseases.\n\n1\\. May Agni drive the takman away from here, may Soma, the press-stone, and\nVaruna, of tried skill; may the altar, the straw (upon the altar), and the\nbrightly-flaming fagots (drive him away)! Away to naught shall go the hateful\npowers!  \n2\\. Thou that makest all men sallow, inflarning them like a searing fire, even\nnow, O takman, thou shalt become void of strength: do thou now go away down,\naye, into the depths!  \nThe takman that is spotted, covered Nvith spots, like reddish sediment, him\nthou, (O plant) of unremitting potency, drive away down below!  \n4\\. Having made obeisance to the takman, I cast him down below: let him, the\nchampion of Sakambhara, return again to the Mahavrishas!  \n5\\. His home is with the Mugavants, his home with the Mahavrishas. From the\nmoment of thy birth thou art indigenous with the Balhikas.  \n6\\. O takman, vyala, vigada, vyanga, hold off (thy missile) far! Seek the\ngadabout slave-girl, strike her with thy bolt!  \n7\\. O takman, go to the Mugavants, or to the Balhikas farther away! Seek the\nlecherous Sudra female: her, O takman, give a good shaking-up!  \n8\\. Go away to the Mahavrishas and the Mugavants, thy kinsfolk, and consume\nthem! Those (regions) do we bespeak for the takman, or these regions here\nother (than ours).  \n9\\. (If) in other regions thou dost not abide, mayest thou that art powerful\ntake pity on us! Takman, now, has become eager: he will go to the Balhikas.  \n10\\. When thou, being cold, and then again deliriously hot, accompanied by\ncough, didst cause the (sufferer) to shake, then, O takman, thy missiles were\nterrible: from these surely exempt us!  \n11\\. By no means ally thyself with balasa, cough and spasm! From there do thou\nnot return hither again: that, O takman, do I ask of thee!  \n12\\. O takman, along with thy brother balasa, along with thy sister cough,\nalong with thy cousin paman, go to yonder foreign folk!  \n13\\. Destroy the takman that returns on (each) third day, the one that\nintermits (each) third day, the one that continues without intermission, and\nthe autumnal one; destroy the cold takman, the hot, him that comes in summer,\nand him that arrives in the rainy season!  \n14\\. To the Gandharis, the Magavants, the Angas, and the Magadhas, we deliver\nover the takman, like a servant, like a treasure!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 20. Charm against takman (fever)](av003.htm)\n\n'
