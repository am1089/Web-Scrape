A wise man looked towards the Self with reverted sight,\nseeking deathlessness.\n\nChildren seek after outward desires; they come to the net of widespread death.\nBut the wise, beholding deathlessness, seek not for the enduring among\nunenduring things.\n\nBy that which perceives form, taste, smell, sounds, and embraces; by this\nverily he discerns, for what else is there? This is that.\n\nThe wise man, thinking that that by which he perceives both waking and\ndreaming life, is the great, the. lord, the Self, grieves not.\n\nHe who perceives the living Self, the honey-eater, close at hand, the lord of\nwhat has been and what shall be, he is no longer seeking for refuge. This is\nthat.\n\np. 19\n\nHe who knows the first-born of radiance, born of old of the waters, standing\nhid in secret, who looked forth through creatures. This is that.\n\nAnd the great mother, full of divinity, who comes forth through life, standing\nhid in secret, who was born through creatures. This is that.\n\nThe fire hidden in the fire-sticks--like a germ, well concealed by the mothers\n--that fire is day by day to be praised by men who wake, with the oblation.\nThis is that.\n\nWhence the sun rises, and whither he goes to setting; that all the bright ones\nrest on, nor does any go beyond it. This is that.\n\nWhat is here, that is there; what is there, that also is here. He goes from\ndeath to death who sees a difference between them.\n\nThis is to be received by the mind, that there is no difference here. From\ndeath to death he goes, who sees a difference.\n\nThe spirit of the measure of a finger stands in the midst, in the Self; lord\nof what has been, and what shall be. Thereafter one is no longer seeking for\nrefuge. This is that.\n\np. 20\n\nThe spirit of the measure of a finger is like a light without smoke; lord of\nwhat has been and what shall be, the same to-day and to-morrow. This is that.\n\nAs water rained on broken ground runs away among the mountains; so he who\nbeholds separate natures runs hither and thither after them.\n\nAs pure water poured in pure remains the same, so is the Self of the\ndiscerning sage, O descendant of Gotama.\n\nUnderstanding the eleven-doored dwelling of the unborn seer of truth, he\ngrieves not; and, freed, he is set free. This is that.\n\nThis is the Swan in the pure world, the radiant in the middle world, the fire\nhere on the altar; as a guest in a dwelling.\n\nThis is the essence of man, the essence of the best, the essence of the deep\nand the ether; those born of the water, of earth, of the deep, of the\nmountains, are that true great one.\n\nHe leads upward the forward-life, and casts back the downward-life. All the\nbright powers bow to the dwarf seated in their midst.\n\np. 21\n\nWhen this lord of the body, standing within the body, departs; when he goes\nforth free from the body, what is left? This is that.\n\nNo mortal lives by the forward-life, nor by the downward-life. But by another\nthey live, in whom these two rest.\n\nThis secret immemorial Eternal, I shall declare to thee; and how the Self is,\non attaining death, O descendant of Gotama.\n\nSome come to the womb, for the embodying of that lord of the body. Others\nreach the resting-place, according to deeds, according to what they have\nunderstood.\n\nThe spirit that wakes in those that dream, moulding desire after desire, is\nthat bright one, that Eternal; that they call the immortal one. In this all\nthe worlds rest, nor does any go beyond it. This is that.\n\nAs fire, being one, on entering the world, is assimilated to form after form;\nso the inner Self of all being is assimilated to form after form, and yet\nremains outside them.\n\nAs the air, being one, on entering the world, is assimilated to form after\n\np. 22\n\nform; so the inner Self of all being is assimilated to form after form, and\nyet remains outside them.\n\nAs the sun, the eye of all the world, is not smeared by visible outer stains;\nso the inner Self of all being is not smirched by sorrow of the world, but\nremains outside it.\n\nThe one ruler, the inner Self of all being, who makes one form manifold; the\nwise who behold him within themselves, theirs is happiness, and not others\'.\n\nThe durable among undurables; the soul of souls, who though one, disposes the\ndesires of many; the wise who behold him within themselves, theirs is peace\neverlasting, and not others\'.\n\nThis is that, they think, the ineffable supreme joy. How then may I know,\nwhether this shines or borrows its light? No sun shines there, nor the moon\nand stars; nor lightnings, nor fire like this. All verily shines after that\nshining. From the shining of that, all this borrows light.\n\n\n\nRooted above, with branches below,\n\np. 23\n\nis this immemorial Tree. It is that bright one, that Eternal; it is called the\nimmortal. In it all the worlds rest; nor does any go beyond it. This is that.\n\nAll that the universe is, moves in life, emanated from it. It is the great\nfear, the upraised thunderbolt. They who have seen it, become immortal.\n\nThrough fear of this, Fire glows; through fear of this, the Sun glows; through\nfear of it, the King and Breath; and Death runs, as fifth.\n\nIf one has been able to understand it here, before the body\'s falling away, he\nbuilds for embodiment in the creative worlds.\n\nAs in a mirror, this is seen in the Self; as in a dream, it is seen in the\nworld; as in \'the waters around, it is seen in the world of sylphs; as in the\nfire and the shadow, it is seen in the world of the Evolver.\n\nConsidering the life of the powers as apart, and their rising and setting as\nthey grow up apart, the wise man grieves not.\n\nMind is higher than the powers, the real is higher than mind; than this real,\nthe great Self is higher;\n\np. 24\n\nand than the great, the unmanifest is higher.\n\nThan the unmanifest, spirit is higher, the universal and formless; knowing\nwhich a being is released, and goes to immortality.\n\nThe form of this does not stand visible, nor does anyone behold it with the\neye., By the heart, the soul, the mind, it is grasped; and those who know it\nbecome immortal.\n\nWhen the five perceptions and mind are steadied; and when the soul struggles\nnot, this, they say, is the highest way.\n\nThis they think to be anion, the firm holding of the powers. Unperturbed is\nthis union, though there be ebb and flow.\n\nNor by speech, nor by mind can it be gained; nor by sight. It is gained by him\nwho can affirm "It is"; how else could it be gained?\n\nIt is to be gained by affirming "It is"; and as the real in what is and is\nnot. In him who obtains it by affirming "It is" its reality is perfected.\n\nWhen all desires that dwell in his heart are let go, the mortal becomes\nimmortal, and reaches the Eternal.\n\np. 25\n\nWhen all the knots of his heart are untied here, the mortal becomes immortal.\nSo far is the teaching.\n\nA hundred and one are the heart\'s channels; of these one passes to the crown.\nGoing up by this, he comes to the immortal. The others lead hither and\nthither. .\n\nThe spirit of the measure of a finger, the inner Self, ever dwells in the\nhearts of men. Let him draw forth this spirit from his body, firmly, like the\npith from a reed.\n\nLet him know that this is the bright one, the immortal. Let him know it is the\nbright one, the immortal.\n\nNachiketas thus having received the knowledge declared by Death, and the whole\nlaw of union, became a passionless dweller in the Eternal, and deathless; and\nso may another who thus knows the union with the Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II.
