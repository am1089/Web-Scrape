These two bodies can be\neasily understood by every one. The gross body can be felt but the subtle body\ncan reason, as every one has experienced in the dreaming state. What keeps\nthese two bodies together? There are ten pranas; five are subtle and five are\ngross. The gross pranas are in the gross body and move thru the gross Nadis or\nnervous system. The subtle pranas are in the subtle body and move thru the\nsubtle Nadis. These two pranas are connected about the heart which is the\norgan of sensation. When the poets and others felt that sensation, they called\nit Atma or God in the heart. The other connection of the pranas is between the\nheart and the navel, that is the mind. The subtle body has as many nerves as\nthe gross body. The three main ones are the Ida, Pingala and Sushumana. The\nIda Nerve is on the left side, the Pingala is on the right and between the two\nis Sushumana. The mouth of the Sushumana\n\np. 19\n\nis closed by the Goddess Kundalini as she is sleeping at the door of the\nSushumana. The Kundalini is in the subtle body and remains there always, but\npart of her divine energy is in the gross body and manifested as Prana, Apana,\nVyana, Samana and Udana. The Kundalini is the creator and the sustainer of the\nuniverse. She is the All in All.\n\nThe best authority on the Kundalini is the Hatha Yoga Pradipika. It says: "The\nKundalini is sleeping, closing the door of the Sushumana. She sleeps above the\nKanda or where the Nadis unite. She gives liberation to the Yogi and bondage\nto fools. He who knows her knows Yoga."\n\nThe location of the Kanda is 12 angulis (or about 9 inches) above the anus and\n3 inches long and 3 inches in breadth. It is the shape of a bird\'s egg and\ncovered with a soft white piece of "cloth."\n\nGreat Rishi Yajnavalkya says the Kanda is about the same location. All\nauthorities on Yoga give the location of the Kanda in the lower part of the\nbody above the anus; and there is sleeping the Kundalini.\n\nThe Hatha Yoga Pradipika says further about the Kanda and Kundalini: "Yogins\n\np. 20\n\nawake the Kundalini that is sleeping at the door of the Sushumana. Seated on\nthe Vajrasan and taking hold of the ankles, Yogi should slowly beat the\nKanda."\n\nWe read in the Sharada Tilaka about Kundalini: "We pray to the Paradevata\nunited with Shiva, whose substance is the pure nectar or bliss, red like unto\nvermillion, the young flower of the hibiscus, the sunset sky, who having crept\nher way thru the mass of sound issuing from the clashing and dashing of the\ntwo winds in the midst of the Sushumana, rises to the brilliant energy which\nglitters with the lustre of ten million lightnings. May she the Kundalini, who\nquickly goes to and returns from Shiva, grant us the fruit of Yoga! She being\nawakened is the cow of plenty to Kaulas, and the Kalpa Creeper of all things\ndesired for those who worship her."\n\nThe Kundalini is the support of all, the Yoga is the means to reach her.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: What the Kundalini is; When She Awakens, What Then?](kmu06.htm)\n\n'
