And (the individual soul is) an appearance (reflection) only.\n\nAnd that individual soul is to be considered a mere appearance of the highest\nSelf, like the reflection of the sun in the water; it is neither directly that\n(i.e. the highest Self), nor a different thing. Hence just as, when one\nreflected image of the sun trembles, another reflected image does not on that\naccount tremble also; so, when one soul is connected with actions and results\nof actions, another soul is not on that account connected likewise. There is\ntherefore no confusion of actions and results. And as that 'appearance' is the\neffect of Nescience, it follows that the sa _m_ sara which is based on it (the\nappearance) is also the\n\np. 69\n\neffect of Nescience, so that from the removal of the latter there results the\ncognition of the soul being in reality nothing but Brahman.\n\nFor those, on the other hand, who maintain that there are many Selfs and all\nof them all-pervading, it follows that there must be a confusion of actions\nand results.--In what way?--According to the opinion of the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khyas there\nexist many all-pervading Selfs, whose nature is pure intelligence, devoid of\nqualities and of unsurpassable excellence. For the common purpose of all of\nthem there exists the pradhana, through which the souls obtain enjoyment and\nrelease.--According to the followers of Ka _n_ ada there exist many all-\npervading Selfs, but they are, like so many jars or stools, mere substances\nand unintelligent in themselves. With those Selfs there co-operate the\ninternal organs (manas), atomic and also unintelligent. From the conjunction\nof these two classes of substances, viz. the Selfs and the internal organs,\nthere spring the nine special qualities of the Selfs, viz. desire, &c. 1 These\nqualities inhere in the individual Selfs separately, without any confusion,\nand that constitutes the sa _m_ sara-state. Final release, on the other hand,\nconsists in the absolute non-origination of those nine qualities.\n\nWith regard to these opinions we remark that, as far as the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khyas are\nconcerned, their doctrine that all Selfs are of the nature of intelligence,\nand that there is no difference between them in the point of proximity (to the\npradhana), &c. 2, implies that, if one Self is connected with pleasure and\npain, all Selfs will be so connected.--Well but, the Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khya might reply, a\ndifference (in the connexion of the individual Selfs with pleasure and pain)\nmay result from the circumstance that the activity of the pradhana aims at the\nisolation (emancipation) of the Selfs 3. Otherwise\n\np. 70\n\nthe activity of the pradhana would serve no other end but to manifest the\npradhana's power, in consequence whereof no final release would ever take\nplace.--This argumentation, we reply, is not sound. For we have no right to\nassume a difference which has for its only motive the accomplishment of an end\ndesirable (to us, viz. the emancipation of the Selfs), but we must rather\nbring forward some proof for that difference. If no such proof can be brought\nforward, the desired end, i.e. the emancipation of the soul, must be supposed\nnot to take place; while at the same time the absence of any cause of\ndifference establishes the confusion of actions and their results.--Against\nthe Ka _n_ adas we urge that if, on their theory, the internal organ is\nconnected with one soul, it must in the same way be connected with all other\nsouls as well, as there is no difference in the point of proximity, &c. 1\nHence, there being no difference of cause and consequently no difference of\neffect, it follows that, when one soul is connected with pleasure and pain,\nall souls are thus connected.--But may not the limitation (of actions and\ntheir results) be caused by the unseen principle (ad _ri_ sh _t_ a)? By no\nmeans, the following Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[69:1](sbe38051.htm#fr_44) Cognition, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion,\nendeavour, merit, demerit, and bhavana.\n\n[69:2](sbe38051.htm#fr_45) The &c. implies the non-activity (audasinya) of the\nSelfs.\n\n[69:3](sbe38051.htm#fr_46) And therefore proceeds in a special definite\ndirection capable of effecting in the end the emancipation of some particular\nSelf.\n\n[70:1](sbe38051.htm#fr_47) The '&c.' implies substantiality and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 51](sbe38052.htm)\n\n"
