It is unholy. Not so, on the ground of Scripture.\n\nThe conclusion arrived at above cannot be accepted, since there is a reason\nwhy the descending soul should enter on the condition of an enjoying soul.\nSuch works as sacrifices, the fruit of which is the enjoyment of the heavenly\nworld, are mixed with evil, for they imply injury to living beings as in the\ncase of the goat offered to Agnishomau. And such injury is evil as it is\nforbidden by texts such as 'let him not harm any creature.' Nor can it be said\nthat the injunctions of sacrificing animals constitute exceptions to the\ngeneral rule of not harming any creature.--For the two injunctions refer to\ndifferent things. The injunction to kill the goat for Agnishomau intimates\nthat the killing of the animal subserves the accomplishment of the sacrifice,\nwhile the injunction not to 'harm' teaches that such harming has disastrous\nconsequences. Should it be said that the prohibition of harming does not refer\nto such actions as the sacrifice of the goat which proceed on the basis of\nscriptural injunction, but only to such actions as spring from natural passion\nor desire (raga); we remark that in the case of sacrifices also the action is\nequally prompted by natural desire. Injunctions such as 'He who desires the\nheavenly world is to sacrifice', teach that sacrifices are to be undertaken by\npersons desirous of certain pleasant results, and such persons having thus\nlearned by what means the result is to be accomplished proceed to action from\nthe natural desire of the result. This applies to the killing of the goat also\nwhich is offered to Agnishomau; man learns from Scripture that such actions\nhelp to accomplish the sacrifice which effects the result, and then performs\nthose actions from natural desire. The case in no way differs from that of\nharm\n\np. 599\n\ndone in ordinary life--where the agent always is prompted by natural desire,\nhaving somehow arrived at the conclusion that his action will accomplish\nsomething aimed at by himself. The same holds good with regard to works of\npermanent obligation. Men learn from Scripture that through the performance of\nthe special duties of their caste they attain happiness of the highest kind,\nand then apply themselves to their duties from a natural desire of such\nhappiness, and therefore such works also are mixed with evil. Hence the souls\nof those who have performed sacrifices, and so on, which contain an element of\nevil, at first experience in the heavenly world that result which is to be\nenjoyed there, and then embodying themselves in non-moving things such as\nplants, experience the fruit of that part of their actions which is of a\nharmful nature. That embodiment in non-moving beings is the result of evil\ndeeds Sm _ri_ ti declares: 'Owing to those defects of work which are due to\nthe body, a man becomes a non-moving being.' From all this it follows that the\nsouls embody themselves in plants to the end of enjoying the fruits of their\nworks.--To this the Sutra replies--it is not so, on account of scriptural\nstatement. For Scripture declares that the killing of sacrificial animals\nmakes them to go up to the heavenly world, and therefore is not of the nature\nof harm. This is declared in the text, 'The animal killed at the sacrifice\nhaving assumed a divine body goes to the heavenly world'; 'with a golden body\nit ascends to the heavenly world.' An action which is the means of supreme\nexaltation is not of the nature of harm, even if it involves some little pain;\nit rather is of beneficial nature.--With this the mantra also agrees: 'Thou\ndost not die, thou goest to the gods on easy paths; where virtuous men go, not\nevil-doers, there the divine Savit _ri_ may lead thee.' An act which has a\nhealing tendency, although it may cause a transitory pain, men of insight\ndeclare to be preservative and beneficial.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 26.
