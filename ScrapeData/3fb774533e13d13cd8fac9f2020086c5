Saunaka said :-- \xc2\x93O Suta! You have described the beautiful narrative of\nthe first Manu Svayambhuva. Now kindly describe to us the narratives of other\nhighly energetic Deva-like Manus.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n2-3. Suta said :-- \xc2\x93O Ri _s_ is! The very wise Narada, well versed in the\nknowledge of S\xc2\x92ri Devi, hearing the glorious character of the first\nSvayambhuva Manu, became desirous to hear of the other Manus and asked the\nEternal Naraya _n_ a :-- O Deva! Now favour me by reciting the origin and\nnarratives of the other Manus.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n4\\. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Devar _s_ i! I have already spoken to you\neverything regarding the first Manu. He had worshipped the Devi Bhagavati, and\nthus he got his foeless kingdom. You know that then.\n\n\n\n5-24 Manu had two sons of great prowess, Priyavrata and Uttanapada. They\ngoverned their kingdoms with fame. The son of this Priyavrata,\n\n\n\np. 1034\n\n\n\nof indomitable valour, is known by the wise as the second Svarochi _s_ a Manu.\nDear to all the beings, this Svarochi _s_ a Manu built his hermitage near the\nbanks of the Kalindi (the Jumna) and there making an earthen image of the Devi\nBhagavati, worshipped the Devi with devotion, subsisting on dry leaves and\nthus practised severe austerities. Thus he passed his twelve years in that\nforest; when, at last, the Devi Bhagavati, resplendent with brilliance of the\nthousand Suns, became visible to him. She got very much pleased with his\ndevotional stotrams. The Devi, the Saviour of the Devas, and Who was of good\nvows, granted to him the sovereignty for one Manvantara. Thus the Devi became\nfamous by the name Tari _n_ i Jagaddhatri. O Narada! Thus, by worshipping the\nDevi Tari _n_ i, Svarochi _s_ a obtained safely the foeless kingdom. Then\nestablishing the Dharma duly, he enjoyed his kingdom with his sons; and, when\nthe period of his manvantara expired, he went to the Heavens. Priyavrata's son\nnamed Uttama became the third Manu. On the banks of the Ganges, be practised\ntapasya and repeated the Vija Mantra of Vagbhava, in a solitary place for\nthree years and became blessed with the favour of the Devi. With rapt devotion\nhe sang hymns wholly to the Devi with his mind full; and, by Her boon, got the\nfoeless kingdom and a continual succession of sons and grandsons. Thus,\nenjoying the pleasures of his kingdom and the gifts of the Yuga Dharma, got in\nthe end, the excellent place, obtained by the best Rajar _s_ is. A very happy\nresult. Priyavarata's another son named Tamasa became the fourth Manu. He\npractised austerities and repeated the Kama Vija Mantra, the Spiritual\nPassword of Kama on the southern banks of the Narmada river and worshipped the\nWorld Mother. In the spring and in the autumn he observed the nine nights' vow\n( the Navaratri) and worshipped the excellent lotus eyed Deves'i and pleased\nHer. On obtaining the Devi's favour, he chanted excellent hymns to Her and\nmade pranams. There he enjoyed the extensive kingdom without any fear from any\nfoe or from any other source of danger. He generated, in the womb of his wife,\nten sons, all very powerful and mighty, and then he departed, to the excellent\nregion in the Heavens.\n\n\n\nThe young brother of Tamasa, Raivata became the Fifth Manu and practised\nausterities on the banks of the Kalindi (the Jumna) and repeated the Kama Vija\nMantra, the spiritual password of Kama, the resort of the Sadhakas, capable to\ngive the highest power of speech and to yield all the Siddhis, and thus he\nworshipped the Devi. He obtained excellent heavens, indomitable power,\nunhampered and capable of all success and a continual line of sons, grandsons,\netc. Then the unrivalled excellent hero Raivata Manu established the several\ndivisions of Dharma and enjoying all the worldly pleasures, went to the\nexcellent region of Indra.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighth Chapter of the Tenth Book on the origin of Manu in the\nMahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 9](bk10ch09.htm)\n\n"
