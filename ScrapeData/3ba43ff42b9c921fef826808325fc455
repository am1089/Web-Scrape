Technically, this word also means the effects of actions. In\nconnection with metaphysics, it sometimes means the effects, of which our past\nactions were the causes. But in _Karma-Yoga_ we have simply to do with the\nword _Karma_ as meaning work. The goal of mankind is knowledge; that is the\none ideal placed before us by Eastern philosophy. Pleasure is not the goal of\nman, but knowledge. Pleasure and happiness come to an end. It is a mistake to\nsuppose that pleasure is the goal; the cause of all the miseries we have in\nthe world is that men foolishly think pleasure to be the ideal to strive for.\nAfter a time man finds that it is not happiness, but knowledge, towards which\nhe is going, and that both pleasure and pain are great teachers, and that he\nlearns as much from evil as from good. As pleasure and pain pass before his\nsoul they leave upon it different pictures, and the result of these combined\nimpressions is what is called man\'s "character." If you take the character of\nany man it really is but the aggregate of tendencies, the sum-total of the\nbent of his mind; you will find that misery and happiness are equal factors in\nthe formation of that character. Good and evil have an equal share in moulding\ncharacter, and in some instances misery is a greater teacher than happiness.\nIn studying the great characters the world has produced, I dare say, in the\nvast majority of cases, it would be found that it was misery that taught more\nthan happiness, it was\n\np. 26\n\npoverty that taught more than wealth, it was blows that. brought out their\ninner fire more than praise.\n\nNow this knowledge, again, is inherent in man; no knowledge comes from\noutside; it is all inside. \'What we say a man "knows," should, in strict\npsychological language, be what he "discovers" or "unveils"; what a man\n"learns" is really what he "discovers," by taking the cover off his own soul,\nwhich is a mine of infinite knowledge. We say Newton discovered gravitation.\nWas it sitting anywhere in a corner waiting for him? It was in his own mind;\nthe time came and he found it out. All knowledge that the world has ever\nreceived comes from the mind; the infinite library of the universe is in your\nown mind. The external world is simply the suggestion, the occasion, which\nsets you to study your own mind, but the object of your study is always your\nown mind. The falling of an apple gave the suggestion to Newton, and he\nstudied his own mind; he rearranged all the previous links of thought in his\nmind and discovered a new link among them, which we call the law of\ngravitation. It was not in the apple nor in anything in the centre of the\nearth. All knowledge therefore, secular or spiritual, is in the human mind. In\nmany cases it is not discovered, but remains covered, and when the covering is\nbeing slowly taken off we say "we are learning," and the advance of knowledge\nis made by the advance of this process of uncovering. The man from whom this\nveil is being lifted is the more knowing man; the man upon whom it lies thick\nis ignorant, and the man from whom it has entirely gone is all-knowing,\nomniscient. There have been omniscient men, and, I believe, there will be yet;\nand that there will be myriads of them in the cycles to come. Like fire in a\npiece of flint, knowledge exists in the mind; suggestion is the friction which\nbrings it out. So with all our feelings and actions--our tears and our smiles,\nour joys and our griefs, our weeping and our\n\np. 27\n\nlaughter, our curses and our blessings, our praises and our blames--every one\nof these we may find, if we calmly study our own selves, to have been brought\nout from within ourselves by so many blows. The result is what we are; all\nthese blows taken together are called _Karma_ ,--work, action. Every mental\nand physical blow that is given to the soul, by which, as it were, fire is\nstruck from it, and by which its own power and knowledge are discovered, is\n_Karma_ , this word being used in its widest sense; thus we are all doing\n_Karma_ all the time. I am talking to you: that is _Karma_. You are listening:\nthat is _Karma_. We breathe: that is _Karma_. We walk: _Karma_. Everything we\ndo, physical or mental, is _Karma_ , and it leaves its marks on us.\n\nThere are certain works which are, as it were, the aggregate, the sum-total,\nof a large number of smaller works. If we stand near the seashore and hear the\nwaves dashing against the shingle we think it is such a great noise; and yet\nwe know that one wave is really composed of millions and millions of minute\nwaves: each one of these is making a noise, and yet we do not catch it; it is\nonly when they become the big aggregate that we hear. Similarly every\npulsation of the heart is work; certain kinds of work we feel and they become\ntangible to us; they are, at the same time, the aggregate of a number of small\nworks. If you really want to judge of the character of a man look not at his\ngreat performances. Every fool may become a hero at one time or another. Watch\na man do his most common actions; those are indeed the things which will tell\nyou the real character of a great man. Great occasions rouse even the lowest\nof human beings to some kind of greatness, but he alone is the really great\nman whose character is great always, the same wherever he be.\n\n_Karma_ in its effect on character is the most tremendous power that man has\nto deal with. Man is, as it were,\n\np. 28\n\na centre, and is attracting all the powers of the universe towards himself,\nand in this centre is fusing them all and again sending them off in a big\ncurrent. Such a centre is the real man, the almighty, the omniscient, and he\ndraws the whole universe towards him; good and bad, misery and happiness, all\nare running towards him and clinging round him; and out of them he fashions\nthe mighty stream of tendency called character and throws it outwards. As he\nhas the power of drawing in anything, so has he the power of throwing it out.\n\nAll the actions that we see in the world, all the movements in human society,\nall the works that we have around us, are simply the display of thought, the\nmanifestation of the will of man. Machines or instruments, cities, ships, or\nmen-of-war, all these are simply the manifestation of the will of man; and\nthis will is caused by character and character is manufactured by _Karma_. As\nis _Karma_ , so is the manifestation of the will. The men of mighty will the\nworld has produced have all been tremendous workers--gigantic souls, with\nwills powerful enough to overturn worlds, wills they got by persistent work,\nthrough ages and ages. Such a gigantic will as that of a Buddha or a Jesus\ncould not be obtained in one life, for we know who their fathers were. It is\nnot known that their fathers ever spoke a word for the good of mankind.\nMillions and millions of carpenters like Joseph had gone; millions are still\nliving. Millions and millions of petty kings like Buddha\'s father had been in\nthe world. If it was only a case of hereditary transmission, how do you\naccount for this petty prince, who was not, perhaps, obeyed by his own\nservants, producing this son, whom half a world worships? How do you explain\nthe gulf between the carpenter and his son, whom millions of human beings\nworship as God? It cannot be solved by the theory of heredity. The gigantic\nwill which Buddha and Jesus threw over the world, whence did it come? Whence\ncame\n\np. 29\n\nthis accumulation of power? It must have been there through ages and ages,\ncontinually growing bigger and bigger, until it burst on society in a Buddha\nor a Jesus, even rolling down to the present day.\n\nAll this is determined by _Karma_ , work. No one can get anything unless he\nearns it; this is an eternal law; we may sometimes think it is not so, but in\nthe long run we become convinced of it. A man may struggle all his life for\nriches; he may cheat thousands, but he finds at last that he did not deserve\nto become rich and his life becomes a trouble and a nuisance to him. We may go\non accumulating things for our physical enjoyment, but only what we earn is\nreally ours. A fool may buy all the books in the world, and they will be in\nhis library; but he will be able to read only those that he deserves to; and\nthis deserving is produced by _Karma_. Our _Karma_ determines what we deserve\nand what we can assimilate. We are responsible for what we are; and whatever\nwe wish ourselves to be, we have the power to make ourselves. If what we are\nnow has been the result of our own past actions, it certainly follows that\nwhatever we wish to be in future can be produced by our present actions; so we\nhave to know how to act. You will say, "What is the use of learning how to\nwork? Every one works in some way or other in this world." But there is such a\nthing as frittering away our energies. With regard to _Karma-Yoga_ , the Gita\nsays that it is doing work with cleverness and as a science: by knowing how to\nwork,. one can obtain the greatest results. You must remember that all work is\nsimply to bring out the power of the mind which is already there, to wake up\nthe soul. The power is inside every man, so is knowledge; the different works\nare like blows to bring them out, to cause these giants to wake up.\n\nMan works with various motives; there cannot be work without motive. Some\npeople want to get fame,\n\np. 30\n\nand they work for fame. Others want money, and they work for money. Others\nwant to have power, and they work for power. Others want to get to heaven, and\nthey work for the same. Others want to leave a name when they die, as they do\nin China, where no man gets a title until he is dead; and that is a better\nway, after all, than with us. When a man does something very good there, they\ngive a title of nobility to his _father_ , who is dead, or to his grandfather.\nSome people work for that. Some of the followers of certain Mahomedan sects\nwork all their lives to have a big tomb built for them when they die. I know\nsects among whom as soon as a child is born a tomb is prepared for it; that is\namong them the most important work a man has to do, and the bigger and the\nfiner the tomb the better off the man is supposed to be. Others work as a\npenance: do all sorts of wicked things, then erect a temple, or give something\nto the priests to buy them off and obtain from them a passport to heaven. They\nthink that this kind of beneficence will clear them and they will go scot-free\nin spite of their sinfulness. Such are some of the various motives for work.\n\nWork for work\'s sake. There are some who are really the salt of the earth in\nevery country and who work for work\'s sake, who do not care for name, or fame,\nor even to go to heaven. They work just because good will come of it. There\nare others who do good to the poor and help mankind from still higher motives,\nbecause they believe in doing good and love good. The motive for name and fame\nseldom brings immediate results, as a rule; they come to us when we are old\nand have almost done with life. If a man works without any selfish motive in\nview, does he not gain anything? Yes, he gains the highest. Unselfishness is\nmore paying, only people have not the patience to practise it. It is more\npaying from the point of view of health also. Love, truth and unselfishness\nare not merely moral figures of speech, but\n\np. 31\n\nthey form our highest ideal, because in them lies such a manifestation of\npower. In the first place, a man who can work for five days, or even for five\nminutes, without any selfish motive whatever, without thinking of future, of\nheaven, of punishment, or anything of the kind, has in him the capacity to\nbecome a powerful moral giant. It is hard to do it, but in the heart of our\nhearts we know its value, and the good it brings. It is the greatest\nmanifestation of power--this tremendous restraint; self-restraint is a\nmanifestation of greater power than all outgoing action. A carriage with four\nhorses may rush down a hill unrestrained, or the coachman may curb the horses.\nWhich is the greater manifestation of power, to let them go or to hold them? A\ncannon-ball flying through the air goes a long distance and falls. Another is\ncut short in its flight by striking against a wall, and the impact generates\nintense heat. All outgoing energy following a selfish motive is frittered\naway; it will not cause power to return to you, but if restrained it will\nresult in development of power. This self-control will tend to produce a\nmighty will, a character which makes a Christ or a Buddha. Foolish men do not\nknow this secret; they nevertheless want to rule mankind. Even a fool may rule\nthe whole world if he works and waits. Let him wait a few years, restrain that\nfoolish idea of governing; and when that idea is wholly gone, he will be a\npower in the world. The majority of us cannot see beyond a few years, just as\nsome animals cannot see beyond a few steps. Just a little narrow circle; that\nis our world. We have not the patience to look beyond, and thus become immoral\nand wicked. This is our weakness, our powerlessness.\n\nEven the lowest forms of work are not to be despised. Let the man who knows no\nbetter, work for selfish ends, for name and fame; but everyone should always\ntry to get towards higher and higher motives and to understand them. "To work\nwe have the right, but not to the fruits\n\np. 32\n\nthereof." Leave the fruits alone. Why care for results? If you wish to help a\nman, never think what that man\'s attitude should be towards you. If you want\nto do a great or a good work, do not trouble to think what the result will be.\n\nThere arises a difficult question in this ideal of work. Intense activity is\nnecessary; we must always work. We cannot live a minute without work. What\nthen becomes. of rest? Here is one side of the life-struggle,--work, in which\nwe are whirled rapidly round. And here is the other, that of calm, retiring\nrenunciation: everything is peaceful around, there is very little of noise and\nshow, only nature with her animals and flowers and mountains. Neither of them\nis a perfect picture. A man used to solitude, if brought in contact with the\nsurging whirlpool of the world, will be crushed by it; just as the fish that\nlives in the deep sea water, as soon as it is brought to the surface, breaks\ninto pieces, deprived of the weight of water on it that had kept it together.\nCan a man who, has been used to the turmoil and the rush of life live at ease\nif he comes to a quiet place? He suffers and perchance may lose his mind. The\nideal man is he who, in the midst of the greatest silence and solitude, finds\nthe intensest activity, and in the midst of the intensest activity finds the\nsilence and solitude of the desert. He has learned the secret of restraint; he\nhas controlled himself. He goes through the streets of a big city with all its\ntraffic, and his mind is as calm as if he were in a cave, where not a sound\ncould reach him; and he is intensely working all the time. That is the ideal\nof Karma-Yoga, and if you have attained to that you have really learned the\nsecret of work.\n\nBut we have to begin from the beginning, to take up the works as they come to\nus and slowly make ourselves, more unselfish every day. We must do the work\nand find out the motive power that prompts us; and, almost\n\np. 33\n\nwithout exception, in the first years, we shall find that our motives are\nalways selfish; but gradually this selfishness will melt by persistence, till\nat last will come the time when we shall be able to do really unselfish work.\nWe may all hope that some day or other, as we struggle through the paths of\nlife, there will come a time when we shall become perfectly unselfish; and the\nmoment we attain to that, all our powers will be concentrated, and the\nknowledge which is ours will be manifest.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II.
