Speech with mind, on account of this being seen and of scriptural\nstatement.\n\nThe Sutras now begin an enquiry into the mode of the going to Brahman of him\nwho knows. At first the soul's departure from the body is considered. On this\npoint we have the text, 'When a man departs from hence his speech is combined\n(sampadyate) with his mind, his mind with his breath, his breath with fire,\nfire with the highest deity' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 6, 1). The doubt here arises\nwhether the speech's being combined with the mind, referred to in the text,\nmeans that the function of speech only is merged in mind, or the organ of\nspeech itself.--The Purvapakshin holds the former view; for, he says, as mind\nis not the causal substance of speech, the latter cannot be merged in it;\nwhile the scriptural statement is not altogether irrational in so far as the\nfunctions of speech and other organs are controlled by the mind, and therefore\nmay be conceived as being withdrawn into it.--This view the Sutra sets aside.\nSpeech itself becomes combined with mind; since that is seen. For the activity\nof mind is observed to go on even when the organ of speech has ceased to act.\n--But is this not sufficiently accounted for by the assumption of the mere\nfunction of speech being merged in mind?--To this the Sutra replies 'and on\naccount of the scriptural word.' The text says distinctly that speech itself,\nnot merely the function of speech, becomes one with the mind. And when the\nfunction of speech comes to an end, there is no other means of knowledge to\nassure us that the function only has come to an end and that the organ itself\ncontinues to have an independent existence. The objection that speech cannot\nbecome one with mind because the latter is not the causal substance of speech,\nwe meet by pointing out that the purport of the text is not that speech is\nmerged in mind, but only that it is combined or connected with it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
