And it is\ncertainly a remarkable irony of fate, that we should be obliged to make this\nremark on the very threshold of an introduction to the Bhagavadgita; for\naccording to the eminent French philosopher, Cousin 2, this great deficiency\nin Sanskrit literature is due, in no inconsiderable measure, to the doctrines\npropounded in the Bhagavadgita itself. But however that may be, this much is\ncertain, that the student of the Bhagavadgita must, for the present, go\nwithout that reliable historical information touching the author of the work,\nthe time at which it was composed, and even the place it occupies in\nliterature, which one naturally desires, when entering upon the study of any\nwork. More especially in an attempt like the present, intended as it mainly is\nfor students of the history of religion, I should have been better pleased, if\nI could, in this Introduction, have concentrated to a focus, as it were, only\nthose well ascertained historical results, on which there is something like a\nconsensus of opinion among persons qualified to judge. But there is no\nexaggeration in saying, that it is almost impossible to lay down even a single\nproposition respecting any important matter connected with the Bhagavadgita,\nabout which any such consensus can be said to exist. The conclusions arrived\nat in this Introduction must, therefore, be distinctly\n\np. 2\n\nunderstood to embody individual opinions only, and must be taken accordingly\nfor what they are worth.\n\nThe full name of the work is Bhagavadgita. In common parlance, we often\nabbreviate the name into Gita, and in Sanskrit literature the name occurs in\nboth forms. In the works of Sa _n_ kara _k_ arya, quotations from the Gita are\nintroduced, sometimes with the words 'In the Gita,' or 'In the Bhagavadgita,'\nand sometimes with words which may be rendered 'In the Gitas,' the plural form\nbeing used 1. In the colophons to the MSS. of the work, the form current,\napparently throughout India, is, 'In the Upanishads sung (Gitas) by the\nDeity.' Sa _n_ kara _k_ arya, indeed, sometimes calls it the \xc3\x8e _s_ vara Gita\n2, which, I believe, is the specific title of a different work altogether. The\nsignification, however, of the two names is identical, namely, the song sung\nby the Deity, or, as Wilkins translates it, the Divine Lay.\n\nThis Divine Lay forms part of the Bhishma Parvan of the Mahabharata--one of\nthe two well-known national epics of India. The Gita gives its name to a\nsubdivision of the Bhishma Parvan, which is called the Bhagavadgita Parvan,\nand which includes, in addition to the eighteen chapters of which the Gita\nconsists, twelve other chapters. Upon this the question has naturally arisen,\nIs the Gita a genuine portion of the Mahabharata, or is it a later addition?\nThe question is one of considerable difficulty. But I cannot help saying, that\nthe manner in which it has been generally dealt with is not altogether\nsatisfactory to my mind. Before going any further into that question, however,\nit is desirable to state some of the facts on which the decision must be\nbased. It appears, then, that the royal family of Hastinapura was divided into\ntwo branches; the one called the Kauravas, and the other the Pa _nd_ avas. The\nformer wished to keep the latter out of the share of the kingdom claimed by\nthem; and so, after many attempts at\n\np. 3\n\nan amicable arrangement had proved fruitless, it was determined to decide the\ndifferences between the two parties by the arbitrament of arms. Each party\naccordingly collected its adherents, and the hostile armies met on the 'holy\nfield of Kurukshetra,' I mentioned in the opening lines of our poem. At this\njuncture, K _ri_ sh _n_ a Dvaipayana, alias Vyasa, a relative of both parties\nand endowed with more than human powers, presents himself before Dh _ri_\ntarash _t_ ra, the father of the Kauravas, who is stated to be altogether\nblind. Vyasa asks Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra whether it is his wish to look with\nhis own eyes on the course of the battle; and on Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra's\nexpressing his reluctance, Vyasa deputes one Sa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya to relate to Dh _ri_\ntarash _t_ ra all the events of the battle, giving to Sa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya, by means of\nhis own superhuman powers, all necessary aids for performing the duty. Then\nthe battle begins, and after a ten days' struggle, the first great general of\nthe Kauravas, namely Bhishma, falls 1. At this point Sa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya comes up to\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra, and announces to him the sad result, which is of course\na great blow to his party. Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra then makes numerous enquiries\nof Sa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya regarding the course of the conflict, all of which Sa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya\nduly answers. And among his earliest answers is the account of the\nconversation between K _ri_ sh _n_ a and Ar _g_ una at the commencement of the\nbattle, which constitutes the Bhagavadgita. After relating to Dh _ri_ tarash\n_t_ ra that 'wonderful and holy dialogue,' and after giving an account of what\noccurred in the intervals of the conversation, Sa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya proceeds to narrate\nthe actual events of the battle.\n\nWith this rough outline. of the framework of the story before us, we are now\nin a, position to consider the opposing arguments on the point above noted.\nMr. Talboys Wheeler writes on that point as follows 2. 'But there remains one\nother anomalous characteristic of the history of the great war, as it is\nrecorded in the Mahabharata, which cannot\n\np. 4\n\nbe passed over in silence; and that is the extraordinary abruptness and\ninfelicity with which Brahmanical discourses, such as essays on law, on\nmorals, sermons on divine things, and even instruction in the so-called\nsciences are recklessly grafted upon the main narrative.... K _ri_ sh _n_ a\nand Ar _g_ una on the morning of the first day of the war, when both armies\nare drawn out in battle-array, and hostilities are about to begin, enter into\na long and philosophical dialogue respecting the various forms of devotion\nwhich lead to the emancipation of the soul; and it cannot be denied that,\nhowever incongruous and irrelevant such a dialogue must appear on the eve of\nbattle, the discourse of K _ri_ sh _n_ a, whilst acting as the charioteer of\nAr _g_ una, contains the essence of the most spiritual phases of Brahmanical\nteaching, and is expressed in language of such depth and sublimity, that it\nhas become deservedly known as the Bhagavad-gita or Divine Song. . . . Indeed\nno effort has been spared by the Brahmanical compilers to convert the history\nof the great war into a vehicle for Brahmanical teaching; and so skilfully are\nmany of these interpolations interwoven with the story, that it is frequently\nimpossible to narrate the one, without referring to the other, however\nirrelevant the matter may be to the main subject in hand.' It appears to me, I\nown, very difficult to accept that as a satisfactory argument, amounting, as\nit does, to no more than this--that 'interpolations,' which must needs be\nreferred to in narrating the main story even to make it intelligible, are\nnevertheless to be regarded 'as evidently the product of a Brahmanical age 1,'\nand presumably also a later age, because, forsooth, they are irrelevant and\nincongruous according to the 'tastes and ideas 1'--not of the time, be it\nremembered, when the 'main story' is supposed to have been written, but--of\nthis enlightened nineteenth century. The support, too, which may be supposed\nto be derived by this argument from the allegation that there has been an\nattempt to Brahmanize, so to say, the\n\np. 5\n\nhistory of the great war, appears to me to be extremely weak, so far as the\nGita is concerned. But that is a point which will have to be considered more\nat large in the sequel 1.\n\nWhile, however, I am not prepared to admit the cogency of Mr. Wheeler's\narguments, I am not, on the other hand, to be understood as holding that the\nGita must be accepted as a genuine part of the original Mahabharata. I own\nthat my feeling on the subject is something akin to that of the great\nhistorian of Greece regarding the Homeric question, a feeling of painful\ndiffidence regarding the soundness of any conclusion whatever. While it is\nimpossible not to feel serious doubts about the critical condition of the\nMahabharata generally; while, indeed, we may be almost certain that the work\nhas been tampered with from time to time 2; it is difficult to come to a\nsatisfactory conclusion regarding any particular given section of it. And it\nmust be remembered, also, that the alternatives for us to choose from in these\ncases are not only these two, that the section in question may be a genuine\npart of the work, or that it may be a later interpolation: but also this, as\nsuggested recently, though not for the first time, by Mr. Freeman 3 with\nreference to the Homeric question, that the section may have been in existence\nat the date of the original epos, and may have been worked by the author of\nthe epos into his own production. For that absence of dread, 'either of the\nlaw or sentiment of copyright,' which Mr. Freeman relies upon with regard to a\nprimitive Greek poet, was by no means confined to the Greek people, but may be\ntraced amongst us also. The commentator Madhusudana Sarasvati likens the Gita\nto those dialogues which occur in sundry Vedic works, particularly the\nUpanishads 4. Possibly--I will not use a stronger word--possibly the Gita may\n\np. 6\n\nhave existed as such a dialogue before the Mahabharata, and may have been\nappropriated by the author of the Mahabharata to his own purposes 1. But yet,\nupon the whole, having regard to the fact that those ideas of unity on which\nMr. Wheeler and others set so much store are scarcely appropriate to our old\nliterature; to the fact that the Gita fits pretty well into the setting given\nto it in the Bhishma Parvan; to the fact that the feeling of Ar _g_ una, which\ngives occasion to it, is not at all inconsistent, but is most consonant, with\npoetical justice; to the fact that there is not in the Gita, in my judgment,\nany trace of a sectarian or 'Brahmanizing' spirit 2, such as Mr. Wheeler and\nalso the late Professor Goldstucker 3 hold to have animated the arrangers of\nthe Mahabharata; having regard, I say, to all these facts, I am prepared to\nadhere, I will not say without diffidence, to the theory of the genuineness of\nthe Bhagavadgita as a portion of the original Mahabharata.\n\nThe next point to consider is as to the authorship of the Gita. The popular\nnotion on this subject is pretty well known. The whole of the Mahabharata is,\nby our traditions, attributed to Vyasa, whom we have already noticed as a\nrelative of the Kauravas and Pa _nd_ avas; and therefore the Bhagavadgita,\nalso, is naturally affiliated to the same author. The earliest written\ntestimony to this authorship, that I can trace, is to be found in Sa _n_ kara\n_k_ arya's commentary on the Gita 4 itself and on the B _ri_ hadara _ny_\nakopanishad 5. To a certain extent, the mention of Vyasa in the body of the\nGita would, from a historic standpoint, seem to militate against this\ntradition. But I have not seen in any of the commentaries to which I have had\naccess, any consideration of this point, as there is of the mention in some\n\np. 7\n\n[paragraph continues] Sm _ri_ tis and Sutras of the names of those to whom\nthose Sm _ri_ tis and Sutras are respectively ascribed 1.\n\nWe must now leave these preliminary questions, unluckily in a state far from\nsatisfactory, and proceed to that most important topic--the date when the Gita\nwas composed, and the position it occupies in Sanskrit literature. We have\nhere to consider the external evidence bearing on these points, which is\ntantalizingly meagre; and the internal evidence, which is, perhaps, somewhat\nmore full. And taking first the internal evidence, the various items falling\nunder that head may be marshalled into four groups. Firstly, we have to\nconsider the general character of the Gita with reference to its mode of\nhandling its subject. Secondly, there is the character of its style and\nlanguage. Thirdly, we have to consider the nature of the versification of the\nGita. And fourthly and lastly, we must take note of sundry points of detail,\nsuch as the attitude of the Gita towards the Vedas and towards caste, its\nallusions to other systems of speculation, and other matters of the like\nnature. On each of these groups, in the order here stated, we now proceed to\nmake a few observations.\n\nAnd first about the manner in which the Gita deals with its subject. It\nappears to me, that the work bears on the face of it very plain marks\nindicating that it belongs to an age prior to the system-making age of\nSanskrit philosophy In 1875, I wrote as follows upon this point: 'My view is,\nthat in the Gita and the Upanishads, the philosophical part has not been\nconsistently and fully worked out. We have there the results of free thought,\nexercised on different subjects of great moment, unfettered by the exigencies\nof any foregone conclusions, or of any fully developed theory. It is\nafterwards, it is at a later stage of philosophical progress, that system-\nmaking arises. In that stage some thinkers interpret whole works by the light\nof some particular doctrines or expressions. And the result is the development\nof a whole multitude of philosophical sects, following the lead of those\nthinkers, and all professing to draw their\n\np. 8\n\ndoctrine from the Gita or the Upanishads, yet each differing remarkably from\nthe other 1.' Since this was written, Professor Max Muller's Hibbert Lectures\nhave been published. And I am happy to find, that as regards the Upanishads,\nhis view coincides exactly with that which I have expressed in the words now\nquoted. Professor Max Muller says: 'There is not what may be called a\nphilosophical system in these Upanishads. They are in the true sense of the\nword guesses at truth, frequently contradicting each other, yet all tending in\none direction 2.' Further corroboration for the same view is also forthcoming.\nProfessor Fitz-Edward Hall, in a passage which I had not noticed before, says\n3: 'In the Upanishads, the Bhagavadgita, and other ancient Hindu books, we\nencounter, in combination, the doctrines which, after having been subjected to\nmodifications that rendered them as wholes irreconcileable, were\ndistinguished, at an uncertain period, into what have for many ages been\nstyled the Sa _n_ khya and the Vedanta.' We have thus very weighty authority\nfor adhering to the view already expressed on this important topic. But as\nProfessor Weber appears to have expressed an opinion 4 intended perhaps to\nthrow some doubt on the correctness of that view, it is desirable to go a\nlittle more into detail to fortify it by actual reference to the contents of\nthe Gita, the more especially as we can thus elucidate the true character of\nthat work. Before doing so, however, it may be pointed out, that the\nproposition we have laid down is one, the test of which lies more in a\ncomprehensive review of the whole of the Gita, than in the investigation of\nsmall details on which there is necessarily much room for difference of\nopinion.\n\nAnd first, let us compare that indisputably systematized work, the current\nYoga-sutras 5, with the Bhagavadgita on one\n\np. 9\n\nor two topics, where they both travel over common ground. In the Gita, chapter\nVI, stanzas 33, 34 ([p. 71](sbe0808.htm#page_71)), we have Ar _g_ una putting\nwhat is, in substance, a question to K _ri_ sh _n_ a, as to how the mind,\nwhich is admittedly 'fickle, boisterous, strong, and obstinate,' is to be\nbrought under control--such control having been declared by K _ri_ sh _n_ a to\nbe necessary for attaining devotion (yoga)? K _ri_ sh _n_ a answers by saying\nthat the mind may be restrained by 'practice (abhyasa) and indifference to\nworldly objects (vairagya).' He then goes on to say, that devotion cannot be\nattained without self-restraint, but that one who has self-restraint, and\nworks to achieve devotion, may succeed in acquiring it. Here the subject\ndrops. There is no further explanation of 'practice' or 'indifference to\nworldly objects,' no exposition of the mode in which they work, and so forth.\nContrast now the Yoga-sutras. The topic is there discussed at the very outset\nof the work. As usual the author begins with 'Now therefore the Yoga is to be\ntaught.' He then explains Yoga by the well-known definition 'Yoga is the\nrestraint of the movements of the mind.' And then after pointing out what the\nmovements of the mind are, he proceeds: 'Their restraint is by means of\npractice and indifference to worldly objects 1,'--the very terms, be it\nremarked in passing, which are used in the Bhagavadgita. But having come thus\nfar, the author of the Sutras does not drop the subject as the author of the\nGita does. He goes on in this wise: Practice is the effort for keeping it\nsteady.' 'And that becomes firmly grounded when resorted to for a long time,\nwithout interruption, and with correct conduct.' So far we have a discussion\nof the first requisite specified, namely, practice. Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali then goes on\nto his second requisite for mental restraint. 'Indifference to worldly objects\nis the consciousness of having subdued desires &c. (Va _s_ ikara sa\xc3\xb1 _g_ \xc3\xb1a)\nwhich belongs to one having no longing for objects visible and those which are\nheard of' (from _S_ astras &c., such as heaven and so forth).\n\np. 10\n\n[paragraph continues] He next proceeds to distinguish another and higher\nspecies of 'indifference,' and then he goes on to point out the results of\nthat self-restraint which is to be acquired in the mode he has expounded. That\nis one instance. Now take another. In chapter VI, stanza 10 and following\nstanzas, the Gita sets forth elaborately the mode of practically achieving.\nthe mental abstraction called Yoga. It need not be reproduced here. The reader\ncan readily find out how sundry directions are there given for the purpose\nspecified, but without any attempt at systematizing. Contrast the Yoga-sutras.\nIn the Sadhanapada, the section treating of the acquisition of Yoga, Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_\nali states in the twenty-ninth aphorism the well-known eight elements of Yoga.\nThen he subdivides these elements, and expatiates on each of them distinctly,\ndefining them, indicating the mode of acquiring them, and hinting at the\nresults which flow from them. 'That inordinate love of subdivision,' which Dr.\nF. E. Hall 1 has somewhere attributed to the Hindus, appears plainly in these\naphorisms, while there is not a trace of it in the corresponding passage in\nthe Bhagavadgita. In my opinion, therefore, these comparisons strongly\ncorroborate the proposition we have laid down regarding the unsystematic, or\nrather non-systematic, character of the work. In the one we have definition,\nclassification, division, and subdivision. In the other we have a set of\npractical directions, without any attempt to arrange them in any very\nscientific order. In the one you have a set of technical terms with specific\nsignifications. In the other no such precision is yet manifest. In one word,\nyou have in the Gita the germs, and noteworthy germs too, of a system 2, and\nyou have most of the raw material of a system, but you have no system ready-\nmade.\n\nLet us look at the matter now from a slightly different point of view. There\nare sundry words used in the Bhagavadgita, the significations of which are not\nquite identical\n\np. 11\n\nthroughout the work. Take, for instance, the word 'yoga,' which we have\nrendered 'devotion.' At Gita, chapter II, stanza 48 ([p.\n49](sbe0804.htm#page_49)), a definition is given of that word. In chapter VI,\nthe signification it bears is entirely different. And again in chapter IX,\nstanza 5, there is still another sense in which the word is used 1. The word\n'Brahman' too occurs in widely varying significations. And one of its\nmeanings, indeed, is quite singular, namely, 'Nature' (see chapter XIV, stanza\n3). Similar observations, to a greater or less extent, apply to the words\nBuddhi, \xc3\x82tman, and Svabhava 2. Now these are words which stand for ideas not\nunimportant in the philosophy of the Bhagavadgita. And the absence of\nscientific precision about their use appears to me to be some indication of\nthat non-systematic character of which we have already spoken.\n\nThere is one other line of argument, which leads, I think, to the same\nconclusion. There are several passages in the Gita which it is not very easy\nto reconcile with one another; and no attempt is made to harmonise them. Thus,\nfor example, in stanza 16 of chapter VII, K _ri_ sh _n_ a divides his devotees\ninto four classes, one of which consists of 'men of knowledge,' whom, K _ri_\nsh _n_ a says, he considers 'as his own self.' It would probably be difficult\nto imagine any expression which could indicate higher esteem. Yet in stanza 46\nof chapter VI, we have it laid down, that the devotee is superior not only to\nthe mere performer of penances, but even to the men of knowledge. The\ncommentators betray their gnostic bias by interpreting 'men of knowledge' in\nthis latter passage to mean those who have acquired erudition in the _S_\nastras and their significations. This is not an interpretation to be\nnecessarily rejected. But there is in it a certain twisting of words, which,\nunder the circumstances here, I am not inclined to accept. And on the other\nhand, it must not be forgotten, that the implication fairly derivable from\nchapter IV, stanza 38 (pp. [62](sbe0806.htm#page_62),\n[63](sbe0806.htm#page_63)), would seem to\n\np. 12\n\nbe rather that knowledge is superior to devotion--is the higher stage to be\nreached by means of devotion as the stepping-stone. In another passage again\nat Gita, chapter XII, stanza 12, concentration is preferred to knowledge,\nwhich also seems to me to be irreconcileable with chapter VII, stanza 16. Take\nstill another instance. At Gita, chapter V, stanza 15, it is said, that 'the\nLord receives the sin or merit of none.' Yet at chapter V, stanza 29, and\nagain at chapter IX, stanza 24, K _ri_ sh _n_ a calls himself 'the Lord and\nenjoyer' of all sacrifices and penances. How, it may well be asked, can the\nSupreme Being 'enjoy' that which he does not even receive?' Once more, at\nchapter X, stanza 29, K _ri_ sh _n_ a declares that 'none is hateful to me,\nnone dear.' And yet the remarkable verses at the close of chapter XII seem to\nstand in point-blank contradiction to that declaration. There through a most\nelaborate series of stanzas, the burden of K _ri_ sh _n_ a's eloquent sermon\nis 'such a one is dear to me.' And again in those fine verses, where K _ri_ sh\n_n_ a winds up his Divine Lay, he similarly tells Ar _g_ una, that he, Ar _g_\nuna, is 'dear' to K _ri_ sh _n_ a. And K _ri_ sh _n_ a also speaks of that\ndevotee as 'dear' to him, who may publish the Mystery of the Gita among those\nwho reverence the Supreme Being 1. And yet again, how are we to reconcile the\nsame passage about none being 'hateful or dear' to K _ri_ sh _n_ a, with his\nown words at chapter XVI, stanza 18 and following stanzas? The language used\nin describing the 'demoniac' people there mentioned is not remarkable for\nsweetness towards them, while K _ri_ sh _n_ a says positively, 'I hurl down\nsuch people into demoniac wombs, whereby they go down into misery and the\nvilest condition.' These persons are scarcely characterised with accuracy 'as\nneither hateful nor dear' to K _ri_ sh _n_ a. It seems to me, that all these\nare real inconsistencies in the Gita, not such, perhaps, as might not be\nexplained away, but such, I think, as indicate a mind making guesses at\ntruth., as Professor Max Muller puts it, rather than a mind elaborating a\ncomplete\n\np. 13\n\nand organised system of philosophy. There is not even a trace of consciousness\non the part of the author that these inconsistencies exist. And the contexts\nof the various passages indicate, in my judgment, that a half-truth is struck\nout here, and another half-truth there, with special reference to the special\nsubject then under discussion; but no attempt is made to organise the various\nhalf-truths, which are apparently incompatible, into a symmetrical whole,\nwhere the apparent inconsistencies might possibly vanish altogether in the\nhigher synthesis. And having regard to these various points, and to the\nfurther point, that the sequence of ideas throughout the verses of the Gita is\nnot always easily followed, we are, I think, safe in adhering to the opinion\nexpressed above, that the Gita is a nonsystematic work, and in that respect\nbelongs to the same class as the older Upanishads.\n\nWe next come to the consideration of the style and language of the\nBhagavadgita. And that, I think, furnishes a strong argument for the\nproposition, that it belongs to an age considerably prior to the epoch of the\nartificial department of Sanskrit literature--the epoch, namely, of the dramas\nand poems. In its general character, the style impresses me as quite archaic\nin its simplicity. Compounds, properly so called, are not numerous; such as\nthere are, are not long ones, and very rarely, if ever, present any puzzle in\nanalysing. The contrast there presented with what is called the classical\nliterature, as represented by Bana or Da _nd_ in, or even Kalidasa, is not a\nlittle striking. In Kalidasa, doubtless, the love for compounds is pretty well\nsubdued, though I think his works have a perceptibly larger proportion of them\nthan the Gita. But after Kalidasa the love for compounds goes through a\nremarkable development, till in later writings it may be said almost to have\ngone mad. Even in Bana and Da _nd_ in, Subandhu and Bhavabhuti, the plethora\nof compounds is often wearisome. And the same remark applies to many of the\ncopperplate and other inscriptions which have been recently deciphered, and\nsome of which date from the early centuries\n\np. 14\n\nof the Christian era. Take again the exuberance of figures and tropes which is\nso marked in the classical style. There is little or nothing of that in the\nGita, where you have a plain and direct style of natural simplicity, and yet a\nstyle not by any means devoid of aesthetic merit like the style of the Sutra\nliterature. There is also an almost complete absence of involved syntactical\nconstructions; no attempt to secure that jingle of like sounds, which 'seems\nto have proved a temptation too strong even for Kalidasa's muse entirely to\nresist. But on the contrary, we have those repetitions of words and phrases,\nwhich are characteristic, and not only in Sanskrit, of the style of an archaic\nperiod 1. Adverting specially to the language as distinguished from the style\nof the Gita, we find such words as Anta, Bhasha, Brahman, some of which are\ncollected in the Sanskrit Index in this volume, which have gone out of use in\nthe classical literature in the significations they respectively bear in the\nGita. The word 'ha,' which occurs once, is worthy of special note. It is the\nequivalent of 'gha,' which occurs in the Vedic Sa _m_ hitas. In the form 'ha'\nit occurs in the Brahma _n_ as. But it never occurs, I think, in what is\nproperly called the classical literature. It is, indeed, found in the Pura _n_\nas. But that is a class of works which occupies a very unique position. There\nis a good deal in the Puranas that, I think, must be admitted to be very\nancient 2; while undoubtedly also there is a great deal in them that is very\nmodern. It is, therefore, impossible to treat the use of 'ha' in that class of\nworks as negativing an inference of the antiquity of any book where the word\noccurs; while its use in Vedic works and its total absence from modern works\nindicate such antiquity pretty strongly. We may, therefore, embody the result\nof this part of the discussion in the proposition, that\n\np. 15\n\nthe Gita is removed by a considerable linguistic and chronological distance\nfrom classical Sanskrit literature. And so far as it goes, this proposition\nagrees with the result of our investigation of the first branch of internal\nevidence.\n\nThe next branch of that evidence brings us to the character of the\nversification of the Gita. Here, again, a survey of Sanskrit verse generally,\nand the verse of the Gita in particular, leads us to a conclusion regarding\nthe position of the Gita in Sanskrit literature, which is in strict accord\nwith the conclusions we have already drawn. In the verse of the Vedic Sa _m_\nhitas, there is almost nothing like a rigidly fixed scheme of versification,\nno particular collocation of long and short syllables is absolutely necessary.\nIf we attempt to chant them in the mode in which classical Sanskrit verse is\nchanted, we invariably come across lines where the chanting cannot be smooth.\nIf we come next to the versification of the Upanishads, we observe some\nprogress made towards such fixity of scheme as we have alluded to above.\nThough there are still numerous lines, which cannot be smoothly chanted, there\nare, on the other hand, a not altogether inconsiderable number which can be\nsmoothly chanted. In the Bhagavadgita a still further advance, though a slight\none, may, I think, be marked. A visibly larger proportion of the stanzas in\nthe Gita conform to the metrical schemes as laid down by the writers on\nprosody, though there are still sundry verses which do not so conform, and\ncannot, accordingly, be chanted in the regular way. Lastly, we come to the\nKavyas and Na _t_ akas--the classical literature. And here in practice we find\neverywhere a most inflexible rigidity of scheme, while the theory is laid down\nin a rule which says, that 'even masha may be changed to masha, but a break of\nmetre should be avoided.' This survey of Sanskrit verse may, I think, be\nfairly treated as showing, that adhesion to the metrical schemes is one test\nof the chronological position of a work--the later the work, the more\nundeviating is such adhesion. I need not stay here to point out, how this view\nreceives corroboration from the rules given on this subject in the standard\nwork\n\np. 16\n\nof Pi _n_ gala on the _Kh_ andas _S_ astra. I will only conclude this point by\nsaying, that the argument from the versification of the Gita, so far as it\ngoes, indicates its position as being prior to the classical literature, and\nnearly contemporaneous with the Upanishad literature.\n\nWe now proceed to investigate the last-group of facts falling under the head\nof internal evidence, as mentioned above. And first as regards the attitude of\nthe Gita towards the Vedas. If we examine all the passages in the Gita, in\nwhich reference is made to the Vedas, the aggregate result appears to be, that\nthe author of the Gita does not throw the Vedas entirely overboard. He feels\nand expresses reverence for them, only that reverence is of a somewhat special\ncharacter. He says in effect, that the precepts of the Vedas are suitable to a\ncertain class of people, of a certain intellectual and spiritual status, so to\nsay. So far their authority is unimpeached. But if the unwise sticklers for\nthe authority of the Vedas claim anything more for them than this, then the\nauthor of the Gita holds them to be wrong. He contends, on the contrary, that\nacting upon the ordinances of the Vedas is an obstacle to the attainment of\nthe summum bonum 1. Compare this with the doctrine of the Upanishads. The\ncoincidence appears to me to be most noteworthy. In one of his recent\nlectures, Professor Max Muller uses the following eloquent language regarding\nthe Upanishads 2: 'Lastly come the Upanishads; and what is their object? To\nshow the utter uselessness, nay, the mischievousness of all ritual\nperformances (compare our Gita, pp. [47](sbe0804.htm#page_47),\n[48](sbe0804.htm#page_48), [84](sbe0811.htm#page_84) 3); to condemn every\nsacrificial act which has for its motive a desire or hope of reward (comp.\nGita, [p. 119](sbe0819.htm#page_119) 4); to deny, if not the existence, at\nleast the exceptional and exalted character of the Devas (comp. Gita, pp.\n[76](sbe0809.htm#page_76)-[84](sbe0811.htm#page_84) 5); and to teach that\nthere is no hope of salvation and deliverance except by the individual self\nrecognising the true and universal self, and finding rest there, where alone\nrest can be found 6' (comp. our Gita Translation, pp.\n[78](sbe0810.htm#page_78)-[83](sbe0811.htm#page_83)).\n\np. 17\n\nThe passages to which I have given references in brackets will show, that\nProfessor Max Muller's words might all be used with strict accuracy regarding\nthe essential teaching of the Bhagavadgita. We have here, therefore, another\nstrong circumstance in favour of grouping the Gita with the Upanishads. One\nmore point is worthy of note. Wherever the Gita refers to the Vedas in the\nsomewhat disparaging manner I have noted, no distinction is taken between the\nportion whi.ch relates to the ritual and the portion which relates to that\nhigher science, viz. the science of the soul, which Sanatkumari speaks of in\nhis famous dialogue with Narada 1. At Gita, chapter II, stanza 45, Ar _g_ una\nis told that the Vedas relate only to the effects of the three qualities,\nwhich effects Ar _g_ una is instructed to overcome. At Gita, chapter VI,\nstanza 44, Ar _g_ una is told that he who has acquired some little devotion,\nand then exerts himself for further progress, rises above the Divine word--the\nVedas. And there are also one or two other passages of the like nature. They\nall treat the Vedas as concerned with ritual alone. They make no reference to\nany portion of the Vedas dealing with the higher knowledge. If the word\nVedanta, at Gita, chapter XV, stanza 15 (p. 113), signifies, as it seems to\nsignify, this latter portion of the Vedas, then that is the only allusion to\nit. But, from all the passages in the Gita which refer to the Vedas, I am\ninclined to draw the inference, that the Upanishads of the Vedas, were\ncomposed at a time not far removed from the time of the composition of the\nGita, and that at that period the Upanishads had not yet risen to the position\nof high importance which they afterwards commanded. In the passage referred to\nat chapter XV, the word Vedantas probably signifies the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yakas, which\nmay be regarded as marking the beginning of the epoch, which the composition\nof the Upanishads brought to its close. And it is to the close of this epoch,\nthat I would assign the birth of the Gita, which is\n\np. 18\n\nprobably one of the youngest members of the group to which it belongs.\n\nIt appears to me, that this conclusion is corroborated by the fact that a few\nstanzas in the Gita are identical with some stanzas in some of the Upanishads.\nWith regard to the epic age of Greece, Mr. E. A. Freeman has said that, in\ncarrying ourselves back to that age, 'we must cast aside all the notions with\nwhich we are familiar in our own age about property legal or moral in literary\ncompositions. It is plain that there were phrases, epithets, whole lines,\nwhich were the common property of the whole epic school of poetry 1.' It\nappears to me that we must accept this proposition as equally applicable to\nthe early days of Sanskrit literature, having regard to the common passages\nwhich we meet with in sundry of the Vedic works, and also sometimes, I\nbelieve, in the different Pura _n_ as. If this view is correct, then the fact\nthat the Gita contains some stanzas in the very words which we meet with in\nsome of the Upanishads, indicates, to my mind, that the conclusion already\ndrawn from other data about the position of the Gita with regard to the\nUpanishads, is not by any means unwarranted, but one to which the facts before\nus rather seem to point.\n\nAnd here we may proceed to draw attention to another fact connected with the\nrelation of the Gita to the Vedas. In stanza 17 of the ninth chapter of the\nGita, only _Rik_ , _S_ aman, and Ya _g_ us are mentioned. The Atharva-veda is\nnot referred to at all. This omission does certainly seem a very noteworthy\none. For it is in a passage where the Supreme Being is identifying himself\nwith everything, and where, therefore, the fourth Veda might fairly be\nexpected to be mentioned. I may add that in commenting on _S_ a _n_\nkarakarya's remarks on this passage, \xc3\x82nandagiri (and Madhusudana Sarasvati\nalso)seems evidently to have been conscious of the possible force of this\nomission of the Atharva-veda. He accordingly says that by force of the word\n'and' in the verse in question, the Atharva _n_ girasas, or Atharva-veda must\n\np. 19\n\nalso be included. Are we at liberty to infer from this, that the Atharva-veda\ndid not exist in the days when the Gita was composed? The explanation\nordinarily given for the omission of that Veda, where such omission occurs,\nnamely, that it is not of any use in ordinary sacrificial matters, is one\nwhich can scarcely have any force in the present instance; though it is\nadequate, perhaps, to explain the words 'those who know the three branches of\nknowledge,' which occur only a few lines after the verse now under\nconsideration. The commentators render no further help than has been already\nstated. Upon the whole, however, while I am not yet quite prepared to say,\nthat the priority of the Gita, even to the recognition of the Atharva-veda as\na real Veda, may be fairly inferred from the passage in question, I think that\nthe passage is noteworthy as pointing in that direction. But further data in\nexplanation of the omission referred to must be awaited.\n\nIf the conclusions here indicated about the relative positions of the Gita and\ncertain Vedic works are correct, we can fairly take the second century B. C.\nas a terminus before which the Gita must have been composed. For the\nUpanishads are mentioned in the Mahabhashya of Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali, which we are\nprobably safe in assigning to the middle of that century. The epoch of the\nolder Upanishads, therefore, to which reference has been so frequently made\nhere, may well be placed at some period prior to the beginning of the second\ncentury B. C. The Atharva-veda is likewise mentioned by Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali 1, and\nas 'ninefold,' too, be it remembered; so that if we are entitled to draw the\nconclusion which has been mentioned above from chapter IX, stanza 17, we come\nto the same period for the date of the Gita. Another point to note in this\nconnexion is the reference to the Sama-veda as the best of the Vedas (see [p.\n88](sbe0812.htm#page_88)). That is a fact which seems to be capable of\nyielding some chronological information. For the estimation in which that Veda\nhas been held appears to have varied at different times. Thus, in the\nAitareya-brahma _n_ a 2, the glory\n\np. 20\n\nof the Saman is declared to be higher than that of the _Rik_ , In the _Kh_\nandogya-upanishad 1 the Saman is said to be the essence of the _Rik_ , which\n_S_ a _n_ kara interprets by saying that the Saman is more weighty, In the Pra\n_s_ na-upanishad 2, too, the implication of the passage V, 5 (in which the\nSaman is stated as the guide to the Brahmaloka, while the Ya _g_ us is said to\nguide to the lunar world, and the _Rik_ to the, human world) is to the same\neffect. And we may also mention as on the same side the N _ri_ si _m_ ha\nTapini-upanishad and the Vedic passage cited in the commentary of, _S_ a _n_\nkara on the closing sentence of the first kha _nd_ a of that Upanishad 3. On\nthe other side, we have the statement in Manu that the sound of the Sama-veda\nis unholy; and the consequent direction that where the sound of it is heard,\nthe _Rik_ and Ya _g_ us should not be recited 4. We have also the passages\nfrom some of the Pura _n_ as noted by Dr. Muir in his excellent work, Original\nSanskrit Texts, which point in the same direction 5. And we have further the\ndirection in the \xc3\x82pastamba Dharma-sutra, that the Saman hymns should not be\nrecited where the other Vedas are being recited 6, as well as the grouping of\nthe sound of the Saman with various classes of objectionable and unholy\nnoises, such as those of dogs and asses. It is pretty evident that the view of\n\xc3\x82pastamba is based on the same theory as that of Manu. Now in looking at the\ntwo classes of authorities thus marshalled, it is plain that the Gita ranges\nitself with those which are unquestionably the more ancient. And among the\nless ancient works, prior to which we may place the Gita on account of the\nfacts now under consideration, are Manu and \xc3\x82pastamba. Now Manu's date is not\nascertained, though, I believe, he is now generally considered to belong to\nabout the second or third century B. C. 7 But . I\n\np. 21\n\n[paragraph continues] Dr. Buhler, in the Preface to his \xc3\x82pastamba in the\npresent series, has adduced good reasons for holding that \xc3\x82pastamba is prior\nto the third century B. C. 1, and we therefore obtain that as a point of time\nprior to which the Gita must have been composed.\n\nThe next important item of internal evidence which we have to note, is the\nview taken of caste in the Bhagavadgita. Here, again, a comparison of the\ndoctrine of the Gita with the conception of caste in Manu and \xc3\x82pastamba is\ninteresting and instructive. The view of Manu has been already contrasted by\nme with the Gita in another place 2. I do not propose to dwell on that point\nhere, as the date of Manu is far from being satisfactorily ascertained. I\nprefer now to take up \xc3\x82pastamba only, whose date, as just now stated, is\nfairly well fixed by Dr. Buhler. The division of castes, then, is twice\nreferred to in the Bhagavadgita. In the first passage ([p.\n59](sbe0806.htm#page_59)) it is stated, that the division rests on differences\nof qualities and duties; in the second (pp. [126](sbe0820.htm#page_126),\n[127](sbe0820.htm#page_127)) the various duties are distinctly stated\naccording to the differences of qualities. Now in the first place, noting as\nwe pass along, that there is nothing in the Gita to indicate whether caste was\nhereditary, according to its view, whereas \xc3\x82pastamba distinctly states it to\nbe such, let us compare the second passage of the Gita with the Sutras of\n\xc3\x82pastamba bearing on the point. The view enunciated in the Gita appears to me\nplainly to belong to an earlier age--to an age of considerably less\nadvancement in social and religious development. In the Gita, for instance,\nthe duties of a Brahma _n_ a are said to be tranquillity, self-restraint, and\nso forth. In \xc3\x82pastamba, they are the famous six duties, namely, study,\nimparting instruction, sacrificing, officiating at others' sacrifices, making\ngifts, and receiving gifts; and three others, namely, inheritance, occupancy,\nand gleaning ears of corn, which, it may be remarked en passant, are not\nstated in Manu. The former seem to my mind to point\n\np. 22\n\nto the age when the qualities which in early times gave the Brahma _n_ as\ntheir pre-eminence in Hindu society were still a living reality 1. It will be\nnoted, too, that there is nothing in that list of duties which has any\nnecessary or natural connexion with any privilege as belonging to the caste.\nThe Law lays down these duties, in the true sense of the word. In \xc3\x82pastamba,\non the contrary, we see an advance towards the later view on both points. You\nhave no reference to moral and religious qualities now. You have to do with\nceremonies and acts. You have under the head 'duties not mere obligations, but\nrights. For the duty of receiving gifts is a right, and so is the duty of\nteaching others and officiating at others' sacrifices; as we know not merely\nfrom the subsequent course of events, but also from a comparison of the duties\nof Brahma _n_ as on the one hand, and Kshatriyas, Vai _s_ yas, and _S_ udras\non the other, as laid down by Manu and \xc3\x82pastamba themselves. \xc3\x82pastamba's\nrules, therefore, appear to belong to the time when the Brahma _n_ as had long\nbeen an established power, and were assuming to themselves those valuable\nprivileges which they have always claimed in later times. The rules of the\nGita, on the other hand, point to a time considerably prior to this--to a time\nwhen the Brahma _n_ as were by their moral and intellectual qualities laying\nthe foundation of that preeminence in Hindu society which afterwards enabled\nthem to lord it over all castes. These observations mutatis mutandis apply to\nthe rules regarding. the other castes also. Here again, while the Gita still\ninsists on the inner qualities, which properly constitute the military\nprofession, for instance, the rules of \xc3\x82pastamba indicate the powerful\ninfluence of the Brahma _n_ as 2. For, as stated before, officiating at\nothers' sacrifices, instructing others, and receiving presents, are here\nexpressly prohibited to Kshatriyas as also to Vai _s_ yas. The result of that\nis, that the Brahma _n_ as become indispensable to the Kshatriyas and Vai _s_\nyas, for\n\np. 23\n\nupon both the duty of study, of offering sacrifices, and making gifts and\npresents is inculcated. In his outline of the History of Ancient Religions,\nProfessor Tiele, speaking of the 'increasing influence of the Brahmans,'\nwrites as follows: 'Subject at first to the princes and nobles, and dependent\non them, they began by insinuating themselves into their favour, and\nrepresenting it as a religious duty to show protection and liberality towards\nthem. Meanwhile they endeavoured to make themselves indispensable to them,\ngradually acquired the sole right to conduct public worship, and made\nthemselves masters of instruction 1'. And after pointing out the high position\nthus achieved by the Brahmans, and the low position of the Ka _nd_ alas and\nothers of the inferior castes, he adds: 'Such a position could not long be\nendured; and this serves to explain not only the rise of Buddhism, but also\nits rapid diffusion, and the radical revolution which it brought about 2.' To\nproceed, however, with our comparison of the Gita and \xc3\x82pastamba. The\nsuperiority distinctly claimed by the latter for the Brahma _n_ a is not quite\nclearly brought out in the Gita. 'Holy Brahma _n_ as and devoted royal saints'\nare bracketed together at [p. 86](sbe0811.htm#page_86); while the Kshatriyas\nare declared to have been the channel of communication between the Deity and\nmankind as regards the great doctrine of devotion propounded by the\nBhagavadgita. That indicates a position for the Kshatriyas much more like what\nthe Upanishads disclose 3, than even that which \xc3\x82pastamba assigns to them. The\nfact is further noteworthy, that in the Gita each caste has its own entirely\ndistinct set of duties. There is no overlapping, so to say. And that is a\ncircumstance indicating a very early stage in the development of the\ninstitution 4. Besides, as already indicated,\n\np. 24\n\nthe duties laid down by \xc3\x82pastamba and Manu as common to Kshatriyas and Vai _s_\nyas are the very duties which make those castes dependent to a very great\nextent on the Brahma _n_ as. Lastly, it is not altogether unworthy of note,\nthat in the elaborate specification of the best of every species which we find\nin chapter X, the Brahma _n_ a is not mentioned as the best of the castes,\nthere is nothing to indicate the notion contained in the well-known later\nverse, 'The Brahma _n_ a is the head of the castes.' On the contrary, the\nruler of men is specified as the highest among men 1, indicating, perhaps, a\nstate of society such as that described at the beginning of the extract from\nProfessor Tiele's work quoted above.\n\nWe come now to another point. What is the position of the Gita in regard to\nthe great reform of _S_ akya Muni, The question is one of much interest,\nhaving regard particularly to the remarkable coincidences between Buddhistic\ndoctrines and the doctrines of the Gita to which we have drawn attention in\nthe foot-notes to our translation. But the materials for deciding the question\nare unhappily not forthcoming. Professor Wilson, indeed, thought that there\nwas an allusion to Buddhism in the Gita 2. But his idea was based on a\nconfusion between the Buddhists and the _K_ arvakas or materialists 3. Failing\nthat allusion, we have nothing very tangible but the unsatisfactory 'negative\nargument' based on mere non-mention of Buddhism in the Gita. That argument is\nnot quite satisfactory to my own mind, although, as I have elsewhere pointed\nout 4, some of the ground occupied by the Gita is common to it with Buddhism,\nand although various previous thinkers Are alluded to directly or indirectly\nin the Gita. There is, however, one view of the facts of this question, which\nappears to me to corroborate the conclusion deducible by means of the negative\nargument here referred to. The\n\np. 25\n\nmain points on which Buddha's protest against Brahmanism rests seem to be the\ntrue authority of the Vedas and the true view of the differences of caste. On\nmost points of doctrinal speculation, Buddhism is still but one aspect of the\nolder Brahmanism 1. The various coincidences to which we have drawn attention\nshow that, if there is need to show it. Well now, on both these points, the\nGita, while it does not go the whole length which Buddha goes, itself embodies\na protest against the views current about the time of its composition. The\nGita does not, like Buddhism, absolutely reject the Vedas, but it shelves\nthem. The Gita does not totally root out caste. It places caste on a less\nuntenable basis. One of two hypotheses therefore presents itself as a rational\ntheory of these facts. Either the Gita and Buddhism were alike the outward\nmanifestation of one and the same spiritual upheaval which shook to its centre\nthe current religion, the Gita being the earlier and less thorough-going form\nof it; or Buddhism having already begun to tell on Brahmanism, the Gita was an\nattempt to bolster it up, so to say, at its least weak points, the weaker ones\nbeing altogether abandoned. I do not accept the latter alternative, because I\ncannot see any indication in the Gita of an attempt to compromise with a\npowerful attack on the old Hindu system; while the fact that, though strictly\northodox, the author of the Gita still undermines the authority, as unwisely\nvenerated, of the Vedic revelation; and the further fact, that in doing this,\nhe is doing what others also had done before him or about his time; go, in my\nopinion, a considerable way towards fortifying the results of the negative\nargument already set forth. To me Buddhism is perfectly intelligible as one\noutcome of that play of thought on high spiritual topics, which in its other,\nand as we may say, less thorough-going manifestations, we see in the\nUpanishads and the Gita 2. But assume that Buddhism was\n\np. 26\n\na protest against Brahmanism prior to its purification and elevation by the\ntheosophy of the Upanishads, and those remarkable productions of ancient\nIndian thought become difficult to account for. Let us compare our small modem\nevents with those grand old occurrences. Suppose our ancestors to have been\nattached to the ceremonial law of the Vedas, as we are now attached to a\nlifeless ritualism, the Upanishads and the Gita might be, in a way, comparable\nto movements like that of the late Raja Rammohun Roy. Standing, as far as\npossible, on the antique ways, they attempt, as Raja Rammohun attempted in\nthese latter days, to bring into prominence and to elaborate the higher and\nnobler aspects of the old beliefs. Buddhism would be comparable to the further\ndeparture from old traditions which was led by Babu Keshub Chander Sen. The\npoints of dissent in the olden times were pretty nearly the same as the points\nof dissent now. The ultimate motive power also was in both cases identical--a\nsense of dissatisfaction in its integrity with what had come down from old\ntimes encrusted with the corruptions of years. In this view the old system,\nthe philosophy of the Upanishads and the Gita, and the philosophy of Buddha,\nconstitute a regular intelligible progression. But suppose the turn events\ntook was different, as is supposed by the alternative theory indicated above.\nSuppose Babu Keshub's movement was chronologically prior, and had begun to\ntell on orthodox, society. Is it likely, that then one of the orthodox party\nwould take up the position which Rammohun Roy took? Would he still rely on old\nauthorities, but with sundry qualifications, and yet earnestly assail the\ncurrent forms of orthodoxy? I do not think so. I think the true view to be, as\nalready stated, very different. The Upanishads, with the Gita, and the\nprecepts of Buddha\n\np. 27\n\nappear to me to be the successive 1 embodiments of the spiritual thought of\nthe age, as it became more and more dissatisfied with the system of mere\nceremonial then dominant.\n\nThere are several other points of much interest in the Bhagavadgita, such as\nthe reference to the Sa _n_ khya, and Yoga; the place assigned to the Marga\n_s_ irsha month; the allusion to the doctrines of materialism; the nearly\nentire coincidence between a stanza of the Gita and one in the Manu Sm _ri_\nti. But in the present state of our knowledge, I do not. think that we can\nextract any historical results from any of them. Without dwelling on them any\nfurther 2, therefore, I will only state it as my opinion that the Sa _n_ khya,\nand Yoga of the Gita are not identical with the systems known to us under\nthose names, and that the Manu Sm _ri_ ti has probably borrowed from the Gita\nthe stanza common to the two works.\n\nWe now proceed to a discussion of some of the external evidence touching the\nage of the Bhagavadgita. It is, of course, unnecessary to consider any\nevidence of a date later than the eighth century A. C., that being the date\ngenerally received, though not on very strong grounds, as the date of Sa _n_\nkara _k_ arya, the celebrated commentator of the Gita 3 For the period prior\nto that limit, the first testimony to consider is that of Ba _n_ abha _tt_ a,\nthe author of the Kadambari. The date of Bana is now fairly well settled as\nthe middle of the seventh century A. C. The doubt which the late Dr. Bhau Daji\nhad cast upon its correctness 4, by impugning the received date of king\nHarshavardhana, appears to me to have been satisfactorily disposed of by the\npaper of\n\np. 28\n\nmy friend Professor R. G. Bha _nd_ arkar on the _K_ alukya dates 1. In the\nKadambari, then, we have testimony to the existence of the Bhagavadgita in the\nmiddle of the seventh century A. C. For in that work, which, as is well known,\nabounds with equivoques, we have a passage which compares the royal palace to\nthe Mahabharata, both being 'Anantagitakar _n_ anananditanaram 2,' which, as\napplied to the royal palace, means 'in which the people were delighted by\nhearing innumerable songs;' and as applied to the Mahabharata means 'in which\nAr _g_ una was delighted at hearing the Anantagita.' Anantagita is evidently\nonly another name here for Bhagavadgita. The conclusion deducible from this\nfact is not merely that the Gita existed, but that it existed as a recognised\nportion of the Bharata, in the seventh century A. C. Now the Kadambari shows,\nin numerous passages, in what high esteem the Mahabharata was held in its\ndays. The queen Vilasavati used to attend at those readings and expositions of\nthe Mahabharata, which have continued down to our own times; and it was even\nthen regarded as a sacred work of extremely high authority, in the same way as\nit is now. It follows., therefore, that the Gita must have been several\ncenturies old ill the time of Ba _n_ abha _tt_ a.\n\nPrior in time to Bana is the Indian Shakespeare, Kalidasa, as he is referred\nto in Ba _n_ abha _tt_ a's Harsha _k_ arita 3, and also in a copperplate\ninscription of the early part of the seventh century, as a poet who had then\nalready acquired a high reputation 4. Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to\nfix exactly the date at which Kalidasa flourished. Still, I think, we have\npretty satisfactory evidence to show that the middle of the fifth century A.\nC. is the very latest date to which he can be referred. In a small tract\n(written by me in 1873), discussing Professor Weber's theory about the Ramaya\n_n_ a, I have pointed out 5 that the Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ atantra\n\np. 29\n\nquotes from Kalidasa a passage which there is good reason to believe formed\npart of the Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ atantra when it was translated for king Nushirvan of\nPersia about the beginning of the sixth century A. C. 1 Allowing for the time\nrequired to raise Kalidasa to the position of being cited as an authority, and\nfor the time required for the spread of the fame of an Indian work to Persia\nin those early days, I think, that the middle of the fifth century is a date\nto which Kalidasa cannot well have been subsequent. Now in the works of\nKalidasa we have some very remarkable allusions to the Bhagavadgita. It is not\nnecessary to go through all these allusions. I will only mention the most\nremarkable, one from the Raghuva _m_ sa, and one from the Kumarasambhava. In\nRaghu, canto X, stanza 67, the gods addressing Vish _n_ u say, 'There is\nnothing for you to acquire which has not been acquired. The one motive in your\nbirth and work is the good of the worlds.' The first sentence here reminds one\nat once of Gita, chapter III, stanza 22, the coincidence with which in sense\nas well as expression is very striking. The second sentence contains the words\n'birth and work,' the precise words employed at Gita IV, 9; and the idea of\n'good of the worlds' is identical with the idea expressed in Gita III, 20-24,\nthe words only in which it is clothed being different. Couple this passage\nwith the one from Kumarasambhava, canto VI, 67, where the seven _Ri_ shis say\nto the Himalaya mountain, 'Well hast thou been called Vish _n_ u in a firmly-\nfixed form.' The allusion there to the Gita, chapter X, stanza 25 ([p.\n89](sbe0812.htm#page_89)), is, I venture to think, unmistakable. The word\n'firmly-fixed' is identical in both passages; the idea is identical, and\nMallinatha refers to the passage in the Gita as the authority which Kalidasa\nhad in view. It follows, therefore, that the Gita must be prior to Kalidasa's\ntime. It may be added, that Kalidasa in his Raghu XV, 67, cites Manu as an\nauthority\n\np. 30\n\nfor the proposition that a king must protect all castes and all orders or a\n_s_ ramas. Manu, therefore, must have lived considerably earlier than\nKalidasa, and the Gita, as we have already argued, must be considerably\nearlier, not only than Manu, but also than his predecessor \xc3\x82pastamba. The\nGita, may, therefore, be safely said to belong to a period several centuries\nprior to the fifth century A. C.\n\nThe next piece of external evidence is furnished by the Vedanta-sutras of\nBadaraya _n_ a. In several of those Sutras, references are made to certain Sm\n_ri_ tis as authorities for the propositions laid down. Take, for instance, I,\n2, 6, or I, 3, 23, and many others. Now three of these sutras are very useful\nfor our present purpose. The first we have to consider is Sutra II, 3, 45. The\ncommentators Sa _n_ kara _k_ arya, Ramanu _g_ a, Madhva, and Vallabha 1 are\nunanimous in understanding the passage in Gita, chapter XV, stanza 7 ([p.\n112](sbe0817.htm#page_112)), to be the one there referred to by the words of\nthe Sutra, which are, 'And it is said in a Sm _ri_ ti.' Now a glance at the\ncontext of the Sutra will, I think, satisfy us that the commentators, who are\nunanimous though representing different and even conflicting schools of\nthought, are also quite right. Sutra 43, in the elliptical language\ncharacteristic of that branch of our literature, says, 'A part, from the\nstatement of difference, and the reverse also; some lay down that it is a\nfisherman or a cheat.' Sutra 44 runs thus, 'And also from the words of the\nMantra.' And then comes Sutra 45 as set out above. It is plain, that the Sutra\nNo. 45 indicates an authority for something not specified, being regarded as\npart of some other thing also not specified. Now the discussion in previous\nSutras has been about the soul; so we can have little difficulty in accepting\nthe unanimous interpretation of the commentators, that the proposition here\nsought to be made out is that the individual soul is part of the Supreme Soul,\nwhich is the proposition laid down in the Gita in the passage referred to. The\n\np. 31\n\nnext Sutra to refer to is IV, 1, 10. I shall not set forth the other relevant\nSutras here as in the preceding case. I only state that the three\ncommentators, _S_ a _n_ kara, Ramanu _g_ a, and Madhva, agree that the Gita is\nhere referred to, namely, chapter VI, stanza ii seq. Vallabha, however, I am\nbound to add, does not agree with this, as he interprets the Sutra in question\nand those which precede and follow as referring to an entirely different\nmatter. If I may be permitted to say so, however, I consider his\ninterpretation not so satisfactory as that of the three other and older\ncommentators. Lastly, we come to Sutra IV, 2-19. On this, again, all the four\ncommentators are unanimous, and they say that Gita, chapter VIII, stanza 24\nseq. ([p. 80](sbe0810.htm#page_80)), is the authority referred to. And I think\nthere can be very little doubt that they are right. These various pieces of\nevidence render it, I think, historically certain, that the Gita must be\nconsiderably prior to the Vedanta-sutras; and that the word Brahma-sutras,\nwhich occurs at Gita, chapter XIII, stanza 4 ([p. 102](sbe0814.htm#page_102)),\nis correctly interpreted by the commentators as not referring to the Vedanta-\nsutras, which are also called Brahma-sutras, but to a different subject\naltogether 1. When were the Vedanta-sutras composed? The question must at once\nbe admitted to be a difficult one; but I think the following considerations\nwill show that the date of those Sutras must, at the latest, be considerably\nearlier than the period which we have already reached in this part of our\ninvestigation. We may take it as fairly well settled, that Bha _tt_ a\nKumarila, the celebrated commentator of the Purva Mima _m_ sa school,\nflourished not later than the end of the seventh century A. C. 2 A\nconsiderable time prior to him must be placed the great commentator on the\nMima _m_ sa-sutras, namely, _S_ abarasyamin. If we may judge from the style of\nhis great commentary, he cannot have flourished much later than Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali,\nwho may now be taken as historically proved to\n\np. 32\n\nhave flourished about 140 B. C. 1 Now a considerable time must have intervened\nbetween _S_ abarasyamin and another commentator on the Purva Mima _m_ sa, whom\n_S_ abara quotes with the highly honorific title Bhagavan, the Venerable,\nnamely, Upavarsha. Upavarsha appears from _S_ a _n_ kara's statement to have\ncommented on the Vedanta-sutras 2. We have thus a long catena of works from\nthe seventh century A. C., indicating a pretty high antiquity for the Vedanta-\nsutras, and therefore a higher one for the Bhagavadgita. The antiquity of the\nVedanta-sutras follows also from the circumstance, which we have on the\ntestimony of Ramanu _g_ a, repeated by Madhava _k_ arya, that a commentary on\nthe Sutras was written by Baudhayana _k_ arya 3, which commentary Ramanu _g_ a\nsays he followed. Baudhayana's date is not accurately settled. But he appears\nto be older than \xc3\x82pastamba, whose date, as suggested by Dr. Buhler, has\nalready been mentioned 4. The Vedanta-sutras, then, would appear to be at\nleast as old as the fourth century B. C.; if the information we have from\nRamanu _g_ a may be trusted. A third argument may be mentioned, bearing on the\ndate of the Vedanta-sutras. In Sutra 110 of the third Pada of the fourth\nAdhyaya of Pa _n_ ini's Sutras, a Para _s_ arya is mentioned as the author of\na Bhikshu-sutra. Who is this Para _s_ arya, and what the Bhikshu-sutra?\nUnluckily Pata\xc3\xb1 _g_ ali gives us no information on this head, nor does the Ka\n_s_ ika V _ri_ tti. But a note of Professor Taranatha Tarkava _k_ aspati, of\nCalcutta, says that Para _s_ arya is Vyasa, and the Bhikshu-sutra is the\nVedanta-sutra 5. If this is correct, the Vedanta-sutras go very far indeed\ninto antiquity. For Pa _n_ ini can certainly not be assigned to a later date\nthan the fourth century B. C., while that learned\n\np. 33\n\nscholar, Professor Goldstucker, on grounds of considerable strength, assigned\nhim to a much earlier date 1. The question thus comes to this, Is the remark\nof Professor Taranatha, above set out, correct? I find then, from enquiries\nmade of my venerable and erudite friend Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1e _s_ var _S_ astrin, the\nauthor of the \xc3\x82ryavidyasudhakara, that the note of Taranatha is based on the\nworks of Bha _tt_ o _g_ i Dikshita, Nago _g_ i Bha _tt_ a, and _G_ \xc3\xb1anendra\nSarasvati, who all give the same interpretation of the Sutra in question. It\nis certainly unfortunate that we have no older authority on this point than\nBha _tt_ o _g_ i. The interpretation is in itself not improbable. Vyasa is\ncertainly by the current tradition 2 called the author of the Vedanta-sutras,\nand also the son of Para _s_ ara. Nor is Bhikshu-sutra a name too far removed\nin sense from Vedanta-sutra, though doubtless the former name is not now in\nuse, at all events as applied to the Sutras attributed to Badaraya _n_ a, and\nthough, it must also be stated, a Bhikshu-sutra Bhashya Vartika is mentioned\neo nomine by Professor Weber as actually in existence at the present day 3.\nTaking all things together, therefore, we may provisionally understand the\nBhikshu-sutra mentioned by Pa _n_ ini to be identical with the Vedanta-sutras.\nBut even apart from that identification, the other testimonies we have adduced\nprove, I think, the high antiquity of those Sutras, and consequently of the\nBhagavadgita.\n\nWe have thus examined, at what, considering the importance and difficulty of\nthe subject, will not; I trust, be regarded as unreasonable length, some of\nthe principal pieces of internal and external evidence touching the age of the\nBhagavadgita and its position in Sanskrit literature. Although, as stated at\nthe very outset, the conclusions we have deduced in the course of that\nexamination are not all such as at once to secure acceptance, I venture to\nthink that we have now adequate grounds for saying, that the various .and\nindependent lines of investigation, which we have pursued, converge to this\npoint, that the Gita, on numerous and\n\np. 34\n\nessential topics, ranges itself as a member of the Upanishad group, so to say;\nin Sanskrit literature. Its philosophy, its mode of treating its subject, its\nstyle, its language, its versification, its opinions on sundry subjects of the\nhighest importance, all point to that one conclusion. We may also, I think,\nlay it down as more than probable, that the latest date at which the Gita can\nhave been composed, must be earlier than the third century B. C., though it is\naltogether impossible to say at present how much earlier. This proposition,\ntoo, is supported by the cumulative strength of several independent lines of\ntestimony.\n\nBefore closing this Introduction, it is desirable to add a word concerning the\ntext of the Bhagavadgita. The religious care with which that text has been\npreserved is very worthy of note. Schlegel and Lassen 1 have both declared it\nas their opinion, that we have the text now almost exactly in the condition in\nwhich it was when it left the hands of the author. There are very few real\nvarious readings, and some of the very few that exist are noted by the\ncommentators. Considering that the Mahabharata must have been tampered with on\nnumerous occasions, this preservation of the Gita is most interesting. It\ndoubtless indicates that high veneration for it which is still felt, and has\nfor long been felt, by the Hindus, and which is embodied in the expression\nused in the colophons of the MSS. describing the Gita as the 'Upanishad sung\nby God 2.' In view of the facts and deductions set forth in this essay that\nexpression existing as, I believe, it does, almost universally in Indian MSS.\nof the Gita, is not altogether devoid of historical value.\n\nSchlegel draws attention to one other circumstance regarding the text of the\nGita, which is also highly interesting, namely, that the number of the stanzas\nis exactly 700.\n\np. 35\n\n[paragraph continues] Schlegel concludes that the author must have fixed on\nthat number deliberately, in order to prevent, as far as be could, all\nsubsequent interpolations 1. This is certainly not unlikely; and if the aim of\nthe author was such as Schlegel suggests, it has assuredly been thoroughly\nsuccessful. In the chapter of the Mahabharata immediately succeeding the\neighteenth chapter of the Gita, the extent of the work in _s_ lokas is\ndistinctly stated. The verses in which this is stated do not exist in the Gau\n_d_ a or Bengal recension, and are doubtless not genuine. But, nevertheless,\nthey are interesting, and I shall reproduce them here. 'Ke _s_ ava spoke 620\n_s_ lokas, Ar _g_ una fifty-seven, Sa\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya sixty-seven, and Dh _ri_ tarash\n_t_ ra one _s_ loka; such is the extent of the Gita.' It is very difficult to\naccount for these figures. According to them, the total number of verses in\nthe Gita would be 745, whereas the number in the current MSS., and even in the\nMahabharata itself, is, as already stated, only 700 2. I cannot suggest any\nexplanation whatever of this discrepancy.\n\nIn conclusion, a few words may be added regarding the general principles\nfollowed in the translation contained in this volume. My aim has been to make\nthat translation as close and literal a rendering as possible of the Gita, as\ninterpreted by the commentators Sa _n_ kara _k_ arya, _S_ ridharasvamin, and\nMadhusudana Sarasvati. Reference has also been frequently made to the\ncommentary of Ramanu _g_ a- _k_ arya, and also to that of Nilaka _nth_ a,\nwhich latter forms part of the author's general commentary on the Mahabharata.\nIn some places these commentators differ among themselves, and then I have\nmade my own choice. The foot-notes are mainly intended to make clear that\nwhich necessarily remains obscure in a literal translation. Some of the notes,\nhowever, also point out the parallelisms existing between the Gita and other\nworks, principally the Upanishads and the Buddhistic Dhammapada and Sutta\nNipata. Of the latter\n\np. 36\n\n[paragraph continues] I have not been able to procure the original Pali; I\nhave only used Sir M. C. Swamy's translation. But I may here note, that there\nare some verses, especially in the Salla Sutta (see pp. 124-127 of Sir M. C.\nSwamy's book), the similarity of which, in doctrine and expression, to some of\nthe verses of the Gita is particularly striking. The analogies between the\nGita and the Upanishads have been made the basis of certain conclusions in\nthis Introduction. Those between the Gita and these Buddhistic works are at\npresent, to my mind, only interesting; I am unable yet to say whether they may\nlegitimately be made the premises for any historical deductions.\n\nThere are two indexes: the first a general index of matters, the second\ncontaining the principal words in the Gita which may prove useful or\ninteresting for philological, historical, or other kindred purposes.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](sbe0802.htm#fr_0) Hibbert Lectures, p. 131.\n\n[1:2](sbe0802.htm#fr_1) Lectures on the History of Modem Philosophy\n(translated by O.
