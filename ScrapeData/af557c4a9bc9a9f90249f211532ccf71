Vyasa said :-- O King! The Devi, hearing thus, laughed and spoke the\nfollowing reasonable words, in a voice deep as a rumbling cloud :-- O Dull\nbrained one! Already I told to that messenger before in reply to you; why then\ndo you boast in vain? If there be any such in the three worlds who can stand\nequal to Me in appearance, strength, and prosperity, I will marry him. Go to\nS\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha and inform them that thus I promised before; therefore\nlet any of them conquer Me in battle and then marry Me according to the\nprescribed rules. You have come here to execute the order of S\xc2\x92umbha; so\neither stand up and fight or fly to Patala with your King.\n\n\n\n6-11. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing the Devi\xc2\x92s words, the Danava was filled\nwith anger and began to shoot dreadful arrows at once on the Lion. Ambika,\nthen, ready-handed, seeing the multitude of arrows coming in the sky like\nserpents, cut them off in a moment to pieces by Her sharp arrows. The Devi,\nthen, drawing Her bow, shot arrows sharpened on stone at the great Asura\nRaktabija. Then that wicked Demon, thus shot at by the arrows, fell\nunconscious on the chariot. When he lay thus senseless, a great uproar arose\namidst his army and the soldiers began to cry aloud saying, \xc2\x93Alas! We all are\nkilled.\xc2\x94 Then S\xc2\x92umbha, the king of the Asuras, hearing the sound of Boomba (a\ndanger cry by hands and mouth) ordered all the Danavas to be ready for the\nbattle.\n\n\n\n12\\. Then S\xc2\x92umbha said :-- Let all Kambojas go to the battle with all their\nforces; let other powerful heroes, especially the Kalakeyas, too, who are very\nstrong heroes, go up for the battle. (Note: Kamboja, name of a people and\ntheir country. They inhabited the Hindoo Koosh mountain which separates the\nGiljit valley from Balkh and probably extended up to little Tibet and Ladak.\nThe Kalakeyas may be the Afridis.)\n\n\n\n13-33. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus ordered, all the fourfold army of S\xc2\x92umbha,\nviz., cavalry, infantry, elephants and chariots went out, intoxicated for war,\nto the battle ground where the Devi existed. The Devi Cha _nd_ ika, seeing the\nDanava forces coming near, made at once terrible sounds frequently. The Ambika\nDevi also made the sound with Her bowstring and blew Her conchshell. Kali,\nthen, shouted aloud opening Her mouth widely. The powerful Lion, the Devi\xc2\x92s\nVahana, hearing the terrible sounds, roared so loudly that the Danavas were\nstruck with strange terror. The powerful Danavas, then, hearing that sound\nbecame\n\n\n\np. 452\n\n\n\nimpatient with anger and shot arrows after arrows on the Devi. The wonderful\nhorrible battle, then, ensued, causing horripilation and the S\xc2\x92aktis of Brahma\nand the other Devas began to come to Cha _nd_ ika Devi. The Devis, the wives\nof the several Devas, then went, to the battlefield in their respective forms\nwith ornaments and Vahanas as generally on such occasions. The S\xc2\x92akti (wife)\nof Brahma named Brahma _n_ i, mounting on the back of Her Swan came there with\na string of beads and Kama _nd_ alu (an wooden waterpot used by ascetics). The\nVai _sn_ avi with Her yellow robes came there mounted on Garu _d_ a (the\nsacred bird of Vi _sn_ u, the carrier of Him) with conch, discus, club, and\nlotus in Her hands. The Devi S\xc2\x92ankari, the wife of S\xc2\x92iva, the Auspicious One,\narrived on the back of Her Bull. The emblem of half-moon was on Her forehead\nwhile in Her hands She held snake, bracelet, and trident (Trisula) and the\nsign of fearlessness for Her devotees. The beautiful wife of Kartika, Kaumari\nDevi, looking like Kartika, came to fight there mounted on a peacock. The\nfairfaced Indra _n_ i, decked with ornaments on Her several limbs, came there\nto fight, with thunder-bolt in Her hand, mounted on the elephant Airavata. The\nVarahi Devi looking like a female boar, came also, seated on an elevated seat\nof departed souls (Preta). The Narasimhi, resembling Nrisimha (the Man Lion\nIncarnation) came there. The wife of Yama, looking fearful like Yama arrived\nthere on the battlefield smiling and with staff in Her hand and mounted on the\nback of a buffalo. Thus the wives of Kuvera, Varu _n_ a, and other Devas came\nthere with proper forms, Vahanas, ornaments, accompanied by their forces and\nall excited. Seeing them all, the Devi Ambika became glad; the Devas, too,\nbecame peaceful and expressed their great joy; the Danavas were afraid at the\nsight of them. S\xc2\x92ankara, auspicious to all the beings, came there to the\nbattlefield, surrounded by these goddesses and thus said to Cha _nd_ ika :--\nSlay quickly all these Asuras, S\xc2\x92umbha, Nis\xc2\x92umbha and all other Danavas to\nserve the cause of the Devas. Let all the goddesses destroy the Danava race\nand thus free the world from dangers; they may, then, return to their own\nabodes. Let the Devas get their shares of sacrifices, let the Brahma _n_ as\nperform the sacrificial acts, and let all the creatures, moving or not moving,\nbe happy. Let all calamities such as proceed from drought, excessive rain,\nrats, foreign invasion, locusts and birds, bats, etc., come to an end. Let the\nclouds bestow rains regularly and let the cultivation yield ample harvests.\nNote here that rats bring in plague.\n\n\n\n34-40. Vyasa said :-- O King! When S\xc2\x92ankara, the Lord of the gods and\nAuspicious to all, said thus, a wonderful female ensued out of the body of Cha\n_nd_ ika, very furious, horrible, with hundreds of jackals surrounding and\nyelling; then that S\xc2\x92akti, of dreadful appearance, said\n\n\n\np. 453\n\n\n\nto the five-faced S\xc2\x92iva, smiling :-- O Deva of the Devas! Go quickly to the\nlord of the Daityas; do the duty of a messenger for us, O Destroyer of lust! O\nS\xc2\x92ankara! Tell that haughty lustful S\xc2\x92umbha and Nis\xc2\x92umbha leave the Heavens\nand go to Patala. Let the Devas reign in the Heavens; Indra go to his own\nbeautiful throne; let all the Devas go to their appropriate places in Heaven\nand receive their sacrificial offerings duly. And if the Demons desire to\nlive, let them go quickly to the city of Patala where other Danavas are\ndwelling. Else, if they like to die, let them go quickly to the battlefield\nand let their flesh be eaten up by Her jackals.\n\n\n\n41\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing Her words, S\xc2\x92ulapa _n_ i went quickly to\nS\xc2\x92umbha, the lord of the Danavas, seated in the assembly, and said thus :--\n\n\n\n42-44. O King! I am Hara, the Destroyer of the Asura Tripura; now I have come\nto you for your good as a messenger of Ambika Devi. Quit the Heavens and Earth\nand go quickly to Patala where reside the powerful Bali and Prahlada, or if\nyou like to court Death, come to fight; I will slay you all in a moment. O\nKing! The Great Queen Ambika Devi has sent me with these instructions for your\nwelfare and information.\n\n\n\n45-63. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus conveying the nectarlike, beneficial words\nof the Devi to the chief Daityas, S\xc2\x92iva, the Holder of the trident, returned\nto his own place. The S\xc2\x92akti that sent S\xc2\x92ambhu as a messenger to the Danavas\nis known in three worlds as S\xc2\x92iva Duti. The Daityas, thus hearing the rigorous\nwords of the Devi, put on their coats of armour and taking their bows and\narrows quickly went out to fight. They came with great force to the\nbattlefield, stretched their bows to their ears and shot piercing arrows,\nsharpened on stone and tipped with iron, at the Cha _nd_ ika Devi. The Kalika\nDevi, too began to strike some with the trident, some with S\xc2\x92akti weapon, and\nsome with clubs and rent them asunder and devoured them all, and began to roam\nin the field. Brahma _n_ i began to pour water from Her Kamandalu on the\npowerful Danavas in the battlefield and thus destroyed them. Mahes\xc2\x92vari,\nmounting on Her Bull gave violent blows by Her trident and thus lay them dead\non the ground. Vai _sn_ avi, with the blow of Her club, took away the lives of\nmany Daityas and striking them with Her Discus out off the heads of several\nothers. Indrani hurled Her thunderbolt on the chief Danavas, already struck by\nthe feet of the elephant and lay them dead on the field. Narasimhi tore the\nstrongest Danavas with the sharp nails and, devouring them, walked to and fro\nand made dreadful sounds. S\xc2\x92iva Duti began to laugh hoarsely and laid the\nDanavas flat on the field, when they were at once devoured by Kalika and Cha\n_nd_ ika. Kaumari, seated on a peacock, by drawing the bowstring to\n\n\n\np. 454\n\n\n\nHer ears hurled arrows sharpened on stone on the enemies and killed them to\nserve the cause of the gods. Varu _n_ i tied down the Danavas by Her Pasa\nweapons in a face to face fighting; thus they lay down senseless on the\nground. O King! Thus the Matrikas, the goddesses, crushed the forces. Then the\nother powerful soldiers fled away terrified. The \xc2\x93Boomba\xc2\x94 danger cry rose then\nloudly; on the other hand, the Devas began to shower flowers on the Devis.\nHearing the distressful agonies of the Asuras and the shouts of victory of the\nDevas, Raktabija, the chief of the Danavas became very angry. Seeing specially\nthe Danavas flying away and the Devas shouting, that powerful Demon came\nhurriedly to the battlefield with anger. Then with eyes reddened with anger,\nand with various weapons came before the Devi, Raktabija mounting on a\nchariot, and making sounds unusual with his bowstring.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-eighth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the description of\nthe fighting of the goddesses in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam the Maha Pura _n_\nam, of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 29](bk05ch29.htm)\n\n'
