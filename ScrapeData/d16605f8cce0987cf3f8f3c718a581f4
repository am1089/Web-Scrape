If it be said that (the udgitha vidya of the B _ri_. Up. and that of the\n_Kh_ and. Up.) are separate on account (of the difference) of the texts; we\ndeny this on the ground of their (essential) non-difference.\n\nWe read in the Va _g_ asaneyaka I, 3, 1, 'The Devas said, well, let us\novercome the Asuras at the sacrifices by means of the Udgitha. They said to\nspeech: Do thou sing out for us.--Yes, said speech,' &c. The text thereupon\nrelates how speech and the other pra _n_ as were pierced by the Asuras with\nevil, and therefore unable to effect what was expected from them, and how in\nthe end recourse was had to the chief vital air, 'Then they said to the breath\nin the mouth: Do thou sing for us.--Yes, said the breath, and sang.'--A\nsimilar story is met with in the _Kh_ andogya I, 2. There we read at first\nthat 'the devas took the udgitha, thinking they would vanquish the Asuras with\nit;' the text then relates how the other pra _n_ as were pierced with evil and\nthus foiled by the Asuras, and how the Devas in the end had recourse to the\nchief vital air, 'Then comes this chief vital air; on that they meditated as\nudgitha.'--As both these passages glorify the chief vital air, it follows that\nthey both are injunctions of a meditation on the vital air. A doubt, however,\narises whether the two vidyas are separate vidyas or one vidya only.\n\nHere the purvapakshin maintains that for the reasons specified in the first\nadhikara _n_ a of the present pada the two\n\np. 193\n\nvidyas have to be considered as one.--But, an objection is raised, there is a\ndifference of procedure which contradicts the assumption of unity. The Va _g_\nasaneyins represent the chief vital air as the producer of the udgitha ('Do\nthou sing out for us'), while the _Kh_ andogas speak of it as itself being the\nudgitha ('on that they meditated as udgitha'). How can this divergence be\nreconciled with the assumption of the unity of the vidyas?--The difference\npointed out, the purvapakshin replies, is not important enough to bring about\na separation of the two vidyas, since we observe that the two both agree in a\nplurality of points. Both texts relate that the Devas and the Asuras were\nfighting; both at first glorify speech and the other pra _n_ as in their\nrelation to the udgitha, and thereupon, finding fault with them, pass on to\nthe chief vital air; both tell how through the strength of the latter the\nAsuras were scattered as a ball of earth is scattered when hitting a solid\nstone. And, moreover, the text of the Va _g_ asaneyaka also coordinates the\nchief vital air and the udgitha in the clause, 'He is udgitha' (B _ri_. Up. I,\n3, 23). We therefore have to assume that in the _Kh_ andogya also the chief\npra _n_ a has secondarily to be looked upon as the producer of the udgitha.--\nThe two texts thus constitute one vidya only.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 7](sbe38150.htm)\n\n"
