Next K _ri_ sh _n_ a-Harita 4 confided this Brahma _n_ a 5 concerning\nspeech to him (his pupil):\n\np. 265\n\n2\\. Pra _g_ apati, the year, after having sent forth all creatures, burst. He\nput himself together again by means of _kh_ andas (Vedas). Because he put\nhimself together again by means of _kh_ andas, therefore (the text of the\nVeda) is called Sa _m_ hita (put together).\n\n3\\. Of that Sa _m_ hita the letter _n_ is the strength, the letter sh the\nbreath and self (\xc3\x82tman).\n\n4\\. He who knows the _Ri_ _k_ verses and the letters _n_ and sh for every Sa\n_m_ hita, he knows the Sa _m_ hita with strength and breath. Let him know that\nthis is the life of the Sa _m_ hita.\n\n5\\. If the pupil asks, 'Shall I say it with the letter _n_ or without it? 'let\nthe teacher say, 'With the letter _n_.' And if he asks, 'Shall I say it with\nthe letter sh or without it?' let the teacher say, 'With the letter sh 1.'\n\n6\\. Hrasva Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya said: 'If we here recite the verses according to\nthe Sa _m_ hita (attending to the necessary changes of n and s into _n_ and sh\n2), and if we say the adhyaya of Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya (Ait. \xc3\x82r. III, 1), then the\nletters _n_ and sh (strength and breath) have by this been obtained for us.'\n\n7\\. Sthavira Sakalya said: 'If we recite the verses according to the Sa _m_\nhita, and if we say the adhyaya of Ma _n_ _d_ ukeya, then the letters _n_ and\nsh have by this been obtained for us.'\n\n8\\. Here the _Ri_ shis, the Kavasheyas 3, knowing\n\np. 266\n\nthis, said: 'Why should we repeat (the Veda), why should we sacrifice? We\noffer as a sacrifice breath in speech, or speech in breath. What is the\nbeginning (of one), that is the end (of the other).'\n\n9\\. Let no one tell these Sa _m_ hitas (Ait. \xc3\x82r. III, 1-III, 2) to one who is\nnot a resident pupil, who has not been with his teacher at least one year, and\nwho is not himself to become an instructor 1. Thus say the teachers, yea, thus\nsay the teachers.\n\n, and then rest in another place finishing it.\n\n11\\. 'And in the place where he reads this, he should not read p. 268 anything\nelse, though he may read this (the Mahavrata) where he has read something\nelse.\n\n12\\. 'No one should bathe and become a snataka 1c who does not read this. Even\nif he has read many other things, he should not become a snataka if he has not\nread this.\n\n13\\. 'Nor should he forget it, and even if he should forget anything else, he\nshould not forget this.\n\n14\\. 'No, he should never forget this.\n\n15\\. 'If he does not forget this, it will be enough for himself (or for\nacquiring a knowledge of the Self).\n\n16\\. 'It is enough, let him know this to be true.\n\n17\\. 'Let him who knows this not communicate, nor dine, nor amuse himself with\nany one who does not know it.'\n\nThen follow some more rules as to the reading of the Veda in general:\n\n18\\. 'When the old water that stood round the roots of trees is dried up\n(after about the month of Pausha, January to February 2c) he should not read;\nnor (at any time) in the morning or in the afternoon, when the shadows meet\n(he should begin at sunrise so soon as the shadows divide, and end in the\nevening before they fall together). Nor should he read 3c when a cloud has\nrisen; and when there is an unseasonable rain (after the months of Srava _n_ a\nand Bhadrapada, August and September 4c) he should stop his Vedic reading for\nthree nights. Nor should he at that time tell stories, not even during the\nnight, nor should he glory in his knowledge.\n\n19\\. 'This (the Veda thus learnt and studied) is the name of that Great Being;\nand he who thus knows the name of that Great Being, he becomes Brahman, yea,\nhe becomes Brahman.'\n\np. 267 p. 268\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[264:4](sbe01238.htm#fr_681) One of the sons of Harita, who was dark. Comm.\n\n[264:5](sbe01238.htm#fr_682) Brahma _n_ a, in the sense of Upanishad, this\nsecret doctrine or explanation. It forms an appendix, like the svish _t_ ak\n_ri_ t at the end of a sacrifice. 'Iva,' which the commentator explains as\nrestrictive or useless, may mean, something like a Brahma _n_ a.\n\n[265:1](sbe01238.htm#fr_683) The letters n and sh refer most likely to the\nrules of _n_ atva and shatva, i. e. the changing of n and s into _n_ and sh.\n\n[265:2](sbe01238.htm#fr_684) If we know whenever n and s should be changed to\n_n_ and sh in the Sa _m_ hita.\n\n[265:3](sbe01238.htm#fr_685) The Kavasheyas said that, after they had arrived\nat the highest knowledge of Brahman (through the various forms of meditation\nand worship that lead to it and that have been described in the Upanishad) no\nfurther meditation and no further sacrifice could be p. 266 required. Instead\nof the morning and evening stoma they offer breath in speech, whenever they\nspeak, or speech in breath, when they are silent or asleep. When speech\nbegins, breathing ceases; when breathing begins, speech ceases.\n\n[266:1](sbe01238.htm#fr_686) The strict prohibition uttered at the end of the\nthird \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka, not to divulge a knowledge of the Sa _m_ hita-upanishad\n(Ait. \xc3\x82r. III, 1-2), as here explained, is peculiar. It would have seemed\nself-evident that, like the rest of the _s_ ruti or sacred literature, the \xc3\x82ra\n_n_ yaka too, and every portion of it, could have been learnt from the mouth\nof a teacher only, and according to rule (niyamena), i. e. by a pupil\nperforming all the duties of a student (brahma _k_ arin 2a), so that no one\nexcept a regular pupil (antevasin) could possibly gain access to it. Nor can\nthere be any doubt that we ought to take the words asa _m_ vatsaravasin and\napravakt _ri_ as limitations, and to translate, 'Let no one tell these Sa _m_\nhitas to any pupil who has not at least been a year with his master, and who\ndoes not mean to become a teacher in turn.'\n\nThat this is the right view is confirmed by similar injunctions given at the\nend of the fifth \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. Here we have first some rules as to who is\nqualified to recite the Mahavrata. No one is permitted to do so, who has not\npassed through the Diksha, the initiation for the Agnish _t_ oma. If the\nMahavrata is performed as a Sattra, the sacrificer is a Hotri priest, and he\nnaturally has passed through that ceremony. But if the Mahavrata is performed\nas an Ekaha or Ahina ceremony, anybody might be the sacrificer, and therefore\nit was necessary to say that no one who is adikshita, uninitiated, should\nrecite it for another person; nor should he do so, p. 267 when the Mahavrata\nis performed without (or with) an altar, or if it does not last one year. In\nsaying, however, that one should not recite the Mahavrata for another person,\nparents and teachers are not to be understood as included, because what is\ndone for them, is done for ourselves.\n\nAfter these restrictions as to the recitation of the Mahavrata, follow other\nrestrictions as to the teaching of it, and here we read, as at the end of the\nUpanishad:\n\n4\\. 'Let no one teach this day, the Mahavrata, to one who is not a regular\npupil (antevasin), and has been so for one year, certainly not to one who has\nnot been so for one year; nor to one who is not a brahma _k_ arin and does not\nstudy the same Veda 1b, certainly not to one who does not study the same Veda;\nnor to one who does not come to him.\n\n5\\. 'Let the teaching not be more than saying it once or twice, twice only.\n\n6\\. 'One man should tell it to one man, so says _G_ atukar _n_ ya.\n\n7\\. 'Not to a child, nor to a man in his third stage of life.\n\n8\\. 'The teacher and pupil should not stand, nor walk, nor lie down, nor sit\non a couch; but they should both sit on the ground.\n\n9\\. 'The pupil should not lean backward while learning, nor lean forward. He\nshould not be covered with too much clothing, nor assume the postures of a\ndevotee, but without using any of the apparel of a devotee, simply elevate his\nknees. Nor should he learn, when he has eaten flesh, when he has seen blood,\nor a corpse, or when he has done an unlawful thing 2b; when he has anointed\nhis eyes, oiled or rubbed his body, when he has been shaved or bathed, put\ncolour on, or ornamented himself with flower-wreaths, when he has been writing\nor effacing his writing 3b.\n\n10\\. 'Nor should he finish the reading in one day, so says _G_ atukar _n_ ya,\nwhile according to Galava, he should finish it in one day. \xc3\x82gnive _s_ yayana\nholds that he should finish all before the Trika _s_ itis 4b\n\n[266:4b](sbe01238.htm#fr_691) See Ait. \xc3\x82r.
