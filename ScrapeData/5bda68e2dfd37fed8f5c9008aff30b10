Mother, do you want\npearls big as the raindrops of autumn?\n\nI shall cross to the pearl island shore. There in the early morning light\npearls tremble on the meadow flowers, pearls drop on the grass, and pearls are\nscattered on the sand in spray by the wild sea-waves.\n\nMy brother shall have a pair of horses with wings to fly among the clouds.\n\nFor father I shall bring a magic pen that, without his knowing, will write of\nitself.\n\nFor you, mother, I must have the casket and jewel that cost seven kings their\nkingdoms.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Sympathy](cm26.htm)\n\n'
