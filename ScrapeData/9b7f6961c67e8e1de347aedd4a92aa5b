The light (is Brahman), on account of the mention of feet.\n\nWe read in the _Kh_ andogya. (III, 13, 7), 'Now that light which shines above\nthis heaven, higher than everything, in the highest worlds beyond which there\nare no other worlds, that is the same light which is within man.'--Here a\ndoubt arises, viz. whether the brightly shining thing here called 'light' is\nthe well-known light of the sun and so on, viewed as a causal universal\nprinciple (Brahman); or the all-knowing, &c., highest Person of infinite\nsplendour, who is different in nature from all sentient and non-sentient\nbeings, and is the highest cause.--The Purvapakshin maintains that the\nreference is to ordinary light. For, he says, the passage does not mention a\nparticular characteristic attribute which can belong to the highest Self only\n--while such attributes _were_ met with in the texts referring to Ether and\nBreath--, and as thus there is no opening for a recognition of the highest\nSelf, and as at the same time the text identifies 'light' with the intestinal\nheat of living beings, we conclude that the text represents the well-known\nordinary light as Brahman, the cause of the world--which is possible as causal\nagency is connected with extreme light and heat.--This prima facie view the\nSutra sets aside. The light which the text states to be connected with heaven\nand possessing supreme splendour can be the highest Person only, since a\npreceding passage in the same section--' All the beings are one foot of it,\nthree feet are the Immortal in heaven'--refers to all beings as being a foot\nof that same being which is connected with heaven. Although the passage, 'That\nlight which shines above,' &c., does not mention a special attribute of the\nhighest Person, yet the\n\np. 248\n\npassage previously quoted refers to the highest Person as connected with\nheaven, and we therefore recognise that Person as the light connected with\nheaven, mentioned in the subsequent passage.\n\nNor does the identification, made in a clause of the text, of light with the\nintestinal heat give rise to any difficulty; for that clause is meant to\nenjoin meditation on the highest Brahman in the form of intestinal heat, such\nmeditation having a special result of its own. Moreover, the Lord himself\ndeclares that he constitutes the Self of the intestinal fire, 'Becoming the\nVai _s_ vanara-fire I abide in the body of living creatures' (Bha. Gi. XV,\n14).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 26. If it be objected that Brahman is not denoted...](sbe48059.htm)\n\n"
