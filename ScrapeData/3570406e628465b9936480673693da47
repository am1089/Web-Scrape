Of course, in Professor\nStenzler's translation, 'in der Mitte der Kuche' is a misprint for 'in der\nMitte der Kuhe.'\n\n[354:5](sbe29199.htm#fr_912) Rig-veda VI, 54, 5; _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, \xc2\xa7 5.\n\n[354:6](sbe29199.htm#fr_913) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6-54.

Perhaps the words ma na _h_ _s_ apta are corrupt; the\ncorrect reading may possibly be, ma\xe0\xa4\xbdvasthata.\n\n[354:7](sbe29199.htm#fr_914) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana, \xc2\xa7 15\\. There is no Mantra in the\nVa _g_ asaneyi Sa _m_ hita beginning with the word mayobhu _h_ , but this word\noccurs in the middle of XVIII, 45 a; the texts which he recites begin at that\nword and extend down to the end of the Anuvaka. It is clear that mayobhu _h_\nwas intended in the original text, from which both _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana and Paraskara\nhave taken this Sutra, as the _Ri_ k-Pratika, Rig-veda X, 169, 1.\n\n[355:9_9](sbe29199.htm#fr_915) According to the commentators, a goat is\nsacrificed.\n\n[355:9_10](sbe29199.htm#fr_916) See chap. 8.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 10](sbe29200.htm)\n\n"
