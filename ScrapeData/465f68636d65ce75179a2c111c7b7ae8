On account of the declaration of difference.\n\n\'On the same tree man sits immersed in grief, bewildered\n\np. 299\n\nby "ani _s_ a"; but when he sees the other one, the Lord, contented, and his\nglory; then his grief passes away\' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 2). This, and similar\ntexts, speak of that one, i.e. the one previously described as the abode of\nheaven, earth, &c., as different from the individual soul.--The text means--\nthe individual soul grieves, being bewildered by her who is not \'i _s_ a,\'\ni.e. Prak _ri_ ti, the object of fruition. But its grief passes away when it\nsees him who is other than itself, i.e. the beloved Lord of all, and his\ngreatness which consists in his ruling the entire world.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 5.
