'If, without knowing this, one offers an Agnihotra, it would be as if a\nman were to remove the live coals and pour his libation on dead ashes.\n\n2\\. 'But he who offers this Agnihotra with a full knowledge of its true\npurport, he offers it (i.e. he eats food) 1 in all worlds, in all beings, in\nall Selfs.\n\n3\\. 'As the soft fibres of the Ishika reed, when thrown into the fire, are\nburnt, thus all his sins are burnt whoever offers this Agnihotra with a full\nknowledge of its true purport.\n\n4\\. 'Even if he gives what is left of his food to a _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala, it\nwould be offered in his (the _K_ a _n_ _d_ ala's) Vai _s_ vanara Self. And so\nit is said in this _S_ loka:--\n\n'As hungry children here on earth sit (expectantly) round their mother, so do\nall beings sit round the Agnihotra, yea, round the Agnihotra.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[91:1](sbe01118.htm#fr_267) Cf.
