However, he did\nnot die for several years afterwards; and miserable years many of them were.\nBesides the weariness of old age, the old fellow had to bear with much abuse\nand cruelty from his sons. Wretched, selfish ingrates! Previously they vied\nwith one another in trying to please their father, hoping thus to receive more\nmoney, but now they had received their patrimony, they cared not how soon he\nleft them--nay, the sooner the better, because he was only a needless trouble\nand expense. And they let the poor old man know what they felt.\n\nOne day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles. The friend\nsympathised very much with him, and promised to think over the matter, and\ncall in a little while and tell him what to do. He did so; in a few days he\nvisited the old man and put down four bags full of stones and gravel __ before\nhim.\n\n"Look here, friend," said he. "Your sons will get to know of my coming here\nto-day, and will inquire about it. You must pretend that I came to discharge a\nlong-standing debt with you, and that you are several thousands of rupees\nricher than you thought you were. Keep these bags in your own hands, and on no\naccount let your sons get to them as long as you are alive. You will soon find\nthem change their conduct towards you. Salaam. I will come again soon to see\nhow you are getting on."\n\nWhen the young men got to hear of this further increase of wealth they began\nto be more attentive and pleasing to their father than ever before. And thus\nthey continued to the day of the, old man\'s demise, when the bags were\ngreedily opened, and found to contain only stones and gravel!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Pigeon and the Crow](ift30.htm)\n\n'
