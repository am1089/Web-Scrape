Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said: The righteous man having enjoyed heaven, is born in a\nstainless family. Now tell me how he is produced in the womb of the mother.\n\nI wish to hear what, in this body, the man of good deeds thinks. Tell me, O\nTreasure-house of Compassion!\n\n3-4. The Blessed. Lord said: You have asked well, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya. I will tell you\nthat supreme secret, even by knowing which one becomes all-knowing.\n\nI will tell you the real nature of that body which possesses the attributes of\nthe universal Egg,--the object of concentration of Yogins.\n\n5-6. Hear how the Yogins perform the meditation upon the six chakras 1 within\nit, and likewise meditation upon the nature of Chit and \xc4\x80nanda in the\nBrahmarandhra,\n\nAnd how he of good deeds is born in the house of the pure and prosperous. I\nwill tell you also about the rites and observances of the parents.\n\np. 142\n\n7-10. After menstruation the women should be avoided for four days. Their face\nshould not be seen during that time, lest sin should arise in the body.\n\nHaving bathed, and washed her clothes, a woman becomes pure on the fourth day.\nFrom the seventh day she becomes fit to perform the rites of worship to the\nforefathers and the Shining Ones.\n\nDuring the seven days the embryo continues impure. Here the sons gradually\nenter during the eighth day.\n\nSons are born on even nights, daughters on odd. Keeping away from, her during\nthe first seven days, on even nights he enters.\n\n11-12. Sixteen nights are declared to be common for women. 1 On the fourteenth\nnight the seed remains there certainly.\n\nThen is produced the righteous son, a store of auspicious qualities. That\nnight is never obtained by vulgar people.\n\n13\\. On the firth. day women should eat sweet foods. Pungent, acid, astringent\nand hot things should be entirely avoided.\n\np. 143\n\n14-18. The husband, like a husbandman, having sown the seed of great\npotentiality in the field which is productive of grain, reaps a good harvest.\n\nThe man, having chewed betel, 1 put on flowers and sandal-paste, and clean\nclothes, and with righteous thoughts in his mind, should unite with his good\nwife.\n\nAccording to the thoughts in his mind at the time of union will be the nature\nof the one who enters the womb.\n\nThe intelligence joined with the seed remains always in the sperm, When\ndesire, thought and sperm become united,\n\nThen the man obtains semen, and in the interior of the womb the formation of\novum takes place, by the union of sperm and germ [cells]\n\n19\\. The good son who enters the womb is the giver of the highest bliss. For\nhim there are numerous rites, such as the Punsavana. 2\n\n20-23. The meritorious soul obtains birth in a high family. At the time of his\nbirth Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s receive much wealth.\n\nHe grows up in his parents\' house, endowed with learning and modesty, becoming\nskilful in all the sciences, by association with the wise.\n\nIn his youth he is divinely handsome, wealthy and benevolent, arising as the\nresult of great merit, austerities, and pilgrimages to sacred waters, formerly\ndone.\n\np. 144\n\nThen he constantly strives to discriminate between the self and the not-self.\nBy adhy\xc4\x81ropa 1 and apav\xc4\x81da 2 he meditates upon Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87.\n\n24\\. For the understanding of the dissociation of Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87 from that with which\nhe is associated, I will tell you the attributes of earth and the others,\nwhich are of the genus "Not-self."\n\n25-30. Earth, water, fire, air and ether--these are called the stable\nelements. This body is made up of the five elements.\n\nSkin, bones, nerves, hair and flesh,--these are the five attributes of earth,\nO Lord of birds, declared to you by me.\n\nSaliva, urine, sperm, marrow, and blood, the fifth,--are said to be the five\nattributes of water. Now hear those of fire:--\n\nHunger, thirst, sloth, sleep and sexual desire--are called the five attributes\nof fire by Yogins everywhere, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya.\n\nBending, running, jumping, stretching and moving,--these are declared the five\nattributes of air.\n\nSpeech, thought, vacuity, delusion and mental instability--the five attributes\nof ether, may be understood by you with effort.\n\n31\\. Mind, reason, individualisation, analysis--these four are called the\nInternal Means, and have the flavour of past karma.\n\np. 145\n\n32\\. Ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose are the sense organs. The organs of\nspeech, hands, feet, the organs of generation and of excretion are the organs\nof action.\n\n33\\. Dik, V\xc4\x81ta, Arka, Prachetas, the two A\xc5\x9bvins, Vahni, Indra, Upeudra, Mitra,\nare declared to be the duties of the organs of sense and action,\n\n34-35. I\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81, 1 Pingal\xc4\x81, 2 Su\xe1\xb9\xa3umn\xc4\x81, 3 thirdly, and also G\xc4\x81ndh\xc4\x81r\xc4\xab, 4 Gajajihva, 5\nP\xc5\xab\xe1\xb9\xa3\xc4\x81, 6 Ya\xc5\x9basvin\xc4\xab, 7\n\nAlambu\xe1\xb9\xa3a, 8 and Kuh\xc5\xab, 9 and Sa\xe1\xb9\x85khin\xc4\xab, 10 the tenth as well--are situated in\nthe interior of the body, and are the ten principal Na\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\xabs. 11\n\n36-39. Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a, Ap\xc4\x81na, Sam\xc4\x81na, Ud\xc4\x81na, and Vy\xc4\x81na also,--N\xc4\x81ga, K\xc5\xabrma, K\xe1\xb9\x9bikala,\nDevadatta and Dhana\xc3\xb1jaya 12:--\n\nIn the heart, Pr\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87a; in the anus, Ap\xc4\x81na; in the navel, Sam\xc4\x81na; in the region\nof the throat, Ud\xc4\x81na; and distributed all over the body, Vy\xc4\x81na:\n\np. 146\n\nVomiting is called N\xc4\x81ga; opening and shutting the eyes is known as K\xc5\xabrma; the\ncause of hunger is to be known as K\xe1\xb9\x9bikala; Yawning, Devadatta;\n\nDhana\xc3\xb1jaya, all-pervading, does not leave even the corpse, and carries all\nover the body the nourishment which is obtained by eating mouthfuls of food.\n\n40-43. The air called Vy\xc4\x81na carries the essential part in all the N\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\xabs. Food,\nas soon as eaten, is split into two by that air.\n\nHaving entered near the anus it separates the solid and liquid portions,\nplacing the water over the fire, and the solid over the water,\n\nThe Pr\xc4\x81na standing under the fire, inflames it slowly. The fire, inflamed by\nthe air, separates the substance from the waste.\n\nThe Vy\xc4\x81na air makes the essence go all over, and the waste, forced through the\ntwelve gateways, is ejected from the body.\n\n44\\. Ears, eyes, nostrils, tongue, teeth, navel, nails, anus, generative\norgans, head, trunk, hair--are called unclean places.\n\n45\\. Thus the airs, having [derived](errata.htm#20) their power from the self,\nperform their own functions, affecting people, just as does the rising of the\nsun.\n\n46\\. Now hear, O Bird, the two-fold nature of the body of man. One is\nVy\xc4\x81vah\xc4\x81rika, and the second P\xc4\x81ram\xc4\x81rthika.\n\np. 147\n\n47-52. On the Vy\xc4\x81vah\xc4\x81rika there are thirty-five millions of hairs of the body,\nseven hundred thousands of hairs of the head, it is said, and twenty nails;\n\nThere are said to be thirty-two teeth usually, O son of Vinat\xc4\x81; the flesh is\nsaid to be one thousand _pal \xc4\x81s_ 1 and blood one hundred _pal \xc4\x81s_;\n\nFat is ten _pal \xc4\x81s_; skin is seven _pal \xc4\x81s_, marrow is twelve _pal \xc4\x81s_; the\n"great blood" is three palas;\n\nSeed is known to be two _ku \xe1\xb8\x8davas_; ovum one _ku \xe1\xb8\x8dava_; and bones in the body\nare said to be three hundred and sixty;\n\nThe _n \xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\xabs_, both dense and subtle, number tens of million; bile is fifty\n_pal \xc4\x81s_; phlegm is half of that;\n\nThe waste materials are not measurable, as they are constantly changing. The\nbody which possesses these attributes is Vy\xc4\x81vah\xc4\x81rika. 2\n\n53\\. All the worlds, mountains, continents, oceans, suns and planets are in\nthe P\xc4\x81ram\xc4\x81rthika 3 body.\n\n54\\. In the P\xc4\x81ram\xc4\x81rthika body, there are six chakras in which are said to be\nlocated the attributes of the egg of Brahm\xc4\x81.\n\n55\\. I will tell you about these, which are the objects of meditation of\nYogins. By pondering upon them one becomes the enjoyer of the nature of\nVair\xc4\x81ja. 4\n\np. 148\n\n56-59. Below the feet is called Atala; above the feet, Vitala; at the knees\nknow it as Sutala; at the thighs Mah\xc4\x81tala;\n\nAt the hips, Tal\xc4\x81tala; at the secret part Ras\xc4\x81tala; at the loins P\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81la; these\nare declared to be the seven worlds:\n\nBh\xc5\xabloka, at the middle of the navel; above it the Bhuvarloka; in the heart,\nSvarloka; at the throat it should be known as Maharloka;\n\nJanaloka, in the region of the mouth; Tapolaka, at the forehead; Satyaloka in\nthe Brahmarandhra--these are the fourteen worlds.\n\n60-61. Meru is situated in the triangle 1; Mandara is in the inverted\ntriangle; Kail\xc4\x81\xc5\x9ba is in the right triangle; Him\xc4\x81chala, in the left triangle.\n\nNi\xe1\xb9\xa3ada is in the upper lines Gandham\xc4\x81dana in the lines on the right; Rama\xe1\xb9\x87a in\nthe lines on the left;--the seven great mountains.\n\n62-65. Jambu is in the place of the bones; S\xc4\x81ka is situated in the marrow; the\nKu\xc5\x9ba continent is situated in the flesh; the Krauncha continent in the nerves;\n\nThe \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81lmal\xc4\xab continent is in the skin; Gomeda, in the mass of hair; Pu\xe1\xb9\xa3kara, in\nthe place of the nails;--and next the oceans:\n\np. 149\n\nIn the urine the K\xe1\xb9\xa3\xc4\x81ra ocean; the K\xe1\xb9\xa3\xc4\xabra ocean in the milk; the Sura ocean is\nsituated in the phlegm; in the [marrow](errata.htm#21), the Gh\xe1\xb9\x9bita ocean;\n\nThe Rasa ocean in the juices; the Dadhi ocean is known to be in the ova; the\nSw\xc4\x81du ocean in the region of the soft palate; you should know son of Vinat\xc4\x81.\n\n66-68. The sun is situated in the N\xc4\x81da chakra; the moon is in the Bindu\nchakra; Mars is situated, it should be known, in the eyes; Mercury is in the\nheart, it is declared;\n\nJupiter is in the Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u-sth\xc4\x81na, it should be known; Venus is situated in the\nseed; Saturn is in the navel; R\xc4\x81hu, in the face, it is declared;\n\nKetu is situated in the lungs;--in the body is the circle of the planets. In\nall these forms one should meditate on his own body.\n\n69-71. Always at dawn, sitting steadily cross-legged, one should meditate upon\nthe six chakras, in the order of the Ajap\xc4\x81. 1\n\nThe G\xc4\x81yatr\xc4\xab called Ajap\xc4\x81 is the giver of liberation to the sages; by merely\nthinking upon it one is released from all sin.\n\nListen, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, and I will explain the best method of Ajap\xc4\x81, by doing which\nthe individual always gives up his separateness.\n\n72-73. M\xc5\xabl\xc4\x81dh\xc4\x81ra, Sw\xc4\x81dhishth\xc4\x81na, Ma\xe1\xb9\x87ip\xc5\xabraka, An\xc4\x81hatam, Vi\xc5\x9buddhi and also \xc4\x80j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81,\n--are spoken of as the six chakras.\n\np. 150\n\nOne should meditate in order upon the chakras, at the root of the generative\norgan; in the region of the pelvis; in the navel; in the heart; in the throat;\nbetween the eyebrows; at the top of the head.\n\n74-75. The m\xc5\xabl\xc4\x81dh\xc4\x81ra is four-petalled and resplendent, with letters from va to\nsa; the Sv\xc4\x81dhi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\xadh\xc4\x81na resembles the sun, is six-petalled, and has the letters\nfrom ba to la; the Ma\xe1\xb9\x87ip\xc5\xabraka is red in colour and has ten petals, from da to\npha; the An\xc4\x81hata is twelve-petalled, from ka to t\xe1\xb8\xa5a, and is golden-coloured;\n\nThe vi\xc5\x9buddhi lotus is sixteen-petalled, with the vowels, and has the light of\nthe moon; the M\xc4\x81tra 1 lotus is two-petalled, has the letters ha and k\xe1\xb9\xa3a, and\nis red in colour; the one at the top of the head is the most resplendent, this\nlotus has a thousand petals, and is the seat of truth and bliss, ever\nauspicious, light-possessing and eternal.\n\n76\\. One should meditate, in order, in the chakras, on Ga\xe1\xb9\x87e\xe1\xb9\xa3a, on Vidhi, 2 on\nVi\xe1\xb9\xa3h\xe1\xb9\x87u, on \xc5\x9aiva, on J\xc4\xabva, on Guru, and on Parambrahma\xe1\xb9\x87, all-pervading.\n\n17-80. It is said by the wise that the subtle movements of the breath in one\nday and night number twenty-one thousand six hundred.\n\np. 151\n\nIt goes out with the sound of "ha," and enters again with the sound of "sa."\nThe individual is, indeed, always repeating the mantra. "Ha\xe1\xb9\x81sa, ha\xe1\xb9\x81sa,"--\n\nSix hundred for Ga\xe1\xb9\x87e\xc5\x9ba; six thousand for Vedhas 1; six thousand for Hari 2;\nsix thousand for Hara. 3\n\nA thousand for the J\xc4\xabv\xc4\x81tman; a thousand for Guru; a thousand or the\nChid\xc4\x81tman;--thus one should understand the respective numbers of the\nrepetitions.\n\n81-82. Aru\xe1\xb9\x87a and other sages, who know the succession of Teachers, meditate\nupon the deities presiding over the chakras, who are rays of Brahma\xe1\xb9\x87.\n\nThe sages, \xc5\x9auka and ethers, teach it to their pupils; therefore a wise man,\nafter meditating upon the path of the Great Ones, should always meditate thus.\n\n83\\. Having worshipped mentally in all the chakras, with unwavering mind, he\nshould repeat the Ajap\xc4\x81-g\xc4\x81yatr\xc4\xab according to the instructions of the Teacher.\n\n84-88. He should meditate in the Ran\xe1\xb8\x8dhra, with the thousand-petalled lotus\ninverted, upon the Blessed Teacher within the Ha\xe1\xb9\x81sa, whose lotus-hand frees\nfrom fear.\n\np. 152\n\nHe should regard his body as being washed in the flow of nectar from His feet.\nHaving worshipped in the five-fold way he should prostrate, singing His\npraise.\n\nThen he should meditate on the Ku\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8dalin\xc4\xab, as moving upwards and downwards, as\nmaking a tour of the six chakras, placed in three-and-a-half coils.\n\nThen he should meditate on the place called Su\xe1\xb9\xa3umn\xc4\x81, which goes out of the\nRandhra; thereby he goes to the highest state of Vi\xe1\xb9\xa3\xe1\xb9\x87u.\n\nThen he should always meditate, between four o\'clock and sunrise, on my form,\nself-illumined, eternal and ever-blissful.\n\n89\\. He should bring his mind to a state of steadiness, not by efforts alone,\nbut under the instruction of a teacher, without whom he falls.\n\n90\\. Having done the inward-sacrifice he should perform the outward-sacrifice.\nHaving done the purificatory ablution, and the Sandhy\xc4\x81, he should worship Hari\nand Hara.\n\n91-94. For those who are attached to the body facing-inward 1 does not come\nabout. For then devotion is easier, and that gives liberation.\n\nTapas, and Yoga, and others, are also ways to liberation, but for those who\nare attached to the world of change the path by devotion to me is far\nsuperior.\n\nThis is the conclusion of the all-knowing Brahma and others, after having\nconned the Vedas and the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras for three periods.\n\nSacrifices and other righteous duties purify the mind. The devotion to me has\na form of fruit from which the obtainer never falls away.\n\np. 153\n\n95\\. The good man who follows this, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, by the union due to devotion to\nme, goes to eternal liberation.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[141:1](gpu17.htm#fr_158) Certain centres in the etheric and higher bodies,\nwhich revolves like wheels when set in motion by meditation; hence the name\nchakra.\n\n[142:1](gpu17.htm#fr_159) Sixteen are favourable, but the fourteenth of them\nis best, if some other cause doer not render it inauspicious.\n\n[143:1](gpu17.htm#fr_160) To augment the virile power.\n\n[143:2](gpu17.htm#fr_161) A rite performed when living conception is observed.\n\n[144:1](gpu17.htm#fr_162) False ascription, and ...\n\n[144:2](gpu17.htm#fr_163) refutation, two sorts of arguments.\n\n[145:1](gpu17.htm#fr_164) The left hand _n \xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\xab_.\n\n[145:2](gpu17.htm#fr_165) The right hand one.\n\n[145:3](gpu17.htm#fr_166) The central one.\n\n[145:4](gpu17.htm#fr_167) This goes to the left eye.\n\n[145:5](gpu17.htm#fr_168) This goes to the right eye.\n\n[145:6](gpu17.htm#fr_169) This goes to the right ear.\n\n[145:7](gpu17.htm#fr_170) This goes to the left ear.\n\n[145:8](gpu17.htm#fr_171) This goes to the mouth.\n\n[145:9](gpu17.htm#fr_172) This goes to the li\xe1\xb9\x85gam.\n\n[145:10](gpu17.htm#fr_173) This gees to the m\xc5\xabla.\n\n[145:11](gpu17.htm#fr_174) An inner nerve, channel for the vital breath.\n\n[145:12](gpu17.htm#fr_175) Various forms of the vital breath.\n\n[147:1](gpu17.htm#fr_176) Pala is a little more than an ounce (6/5 oz.)\n\n[147:2](gpu17.htm#fr_177) Individual and common physical body.\n\n[147:3](gpu17.htm#fr_178) Universal and spiritual body.\n\n[147:4](gpu17.htm#fr_179) Viraj means "to shine."\n\n[148:1](gpu17.htm#fr_180) The triangle in the triangle.
