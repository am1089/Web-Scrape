THE AGNY\xc3\x82DH\xc3\x82NA OR ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SACRED FIRES.\n\n### FIRST ADHY\xc3\x82YA. FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\nTHE Agny-adhana (or Agny-adheya), or ceremony of establishing a set of\nsacrificial fires, on the part of a young householder, is, as a rule,\nperformed on the first day of the waxing moon. Some authorities also allow the\nperformance to take place at full moon, probably in order to enable the newly-\nmarried couple to enter on their sacred duties with as little delay as\npossible. Moreover, special benefits are supposed to accrue to the performer\nof the ceremony from the conjunction of the new moon with certain lunar\nasterisms; though the author of our work, at any rate, does not seem greatly\nto encourage this practice, but rather to urge the pious householder to set up\nfires of his own, whenever he feels a longing for the sacrifice.\n\nThe normal performance of the Agnyadhana, as that of the full and new-moon\nofferings, requires two days; the first of which is taken up with preliminary\nrites, while the second--that is, the first day of the respective half-moon--\nis devoted to the chief ceremonies, beginning with the production of the\nsacred fire by friction. (See II, 1, 4, 8 seq.)\n\nAfter the sacrificer has chosen his four officiating priests--viz. the\nBrahman, Hot _ri_ , Adhvaryu, and \xc3\x82gnidhra (or Agnidh)--he proceeds, together\nwith them, to erect the two sheds or \'firehouses.\' In order to determine their\nexact sites, the Adhvaryu first draws from west to east the so-called\n\'easterly\' line (cf. I, 2, 5, 14), and on it marks, at 8, 11, or 12 prakramas\nor steps from each other, the centres of the Garhapatya and \xc3\x82havaniya fire-\nplaces, the outlines of which he then traces, making each a square aratni or\ncubit in area, the former circular, the latter square. The Dakshi _n_ agni\n\np. 275\n\nor Anvaharya-pa _k_ ana, if it is required at all, is of the same area, but of\nsemicircular form, and lies south of the space between the altar and the\nGarhapatya fire. The Garhapatya fire-house is constructed with its laths\nrunning either from west to east, or from south to north, and a door on the\nsouth side; and so as to enclose both the Garhapatya and Dakshi _n_ a fires.\nThe \xc3\x82havaniya fire-house, on the other hand, with its laths necessarily\nrunning from west to east, and an entrance from the east, contains the\n\xc3\x82havaniya fire and the altar (vedi) adjoining it on the west, and partly\nenclosing it with its \'shoulders\' on the north and south sides. The two houses\nare also open to each other on the inner side; and sufficient space is left on\nall sides for freely moving around the fires.\n\nThe Adhvaryu then procures a temporary fire,--either producing it by friction,\nor obtaining it from certain specified sources in the village,--and after the\nusual fivefold lustration of the Garhapatya fire-place (cf. [p.\n2](sbe1203.htm#page_2)), he lays down the fire thereon. Towards sunset the\nsacrificer [while seated east of the \xc3\x82havaniya house] invokes the gods and\nmanes with \'Gods, fathers! fathers, gods! I sacrifice, being who I am; neither\nwill I exclude him whose I am: mine own shall be the offering, mine own the\ntoiling, mine own the sacrifice!\' He then enters the \xc3\x82havaniya house from the\neast, passes through it to the Garhapatya, and sits down behind (west of) the\nfire; his wife at the same time entering the Garhapatya house from the south\nand seating herself south of him,--both facing the east. Thereupon the\nAdhvaryu hands to the sacrificer two pieces of wood (ara _n_ i),--if possible,\nof a _s_ vattha, grown out of a _s_ ami tree,--to be used next morning for the\nproduction (or \'churning\') of the sacred fire by one of them (the upper ara\n_n_ i) being rapidly drilled in a hole in the other (or lower ara _n_ i). [The\nsacrificer and his wife then lay the upper and lower sticks respectively on\ntheir laps; whereupon certain propitiatory ceremonies are performed by them,\nand honours are paid to the priests and the sticks; and the latter are finally\ndeposited on a seat.] In the house of the Garhapatya a he-goat may then be\ntied up for the night, which, if it belong to the sacrificer, is to be\npresented by him to the \xc3\x82gnidhra on the completion of the sacrifice.\n\nAfter sunset the Adhvaryu measures out four vessels of husked rice grains--\neach containing three handfuls, which quantity is considered sufficient to\nfurnish a meal for one man--on an ox-hide died red [and spread out with the\nhairy side upwards and the neck-part to the east]. With this rice the (odana)\n_k_ atushpra _s_ ya, or \'(pap) to be eaten by the four (priests),\' is prepared\non the provisional Garhapatya fire. When it is ready, the Adhvaryu makes a\nhollow in the pap and pours clarified butter into it. He then takes\n\np. 276\n\nthree kindling-sticks (samidh), anoints them with some of that ghee, and puts\nthem on the fire one after another, with texts (cf. note on II, 1, 4, 5).\nThereupon the sacrificer [having paid due honours to the priests by washing\ntheir feet and giving them perfumes and wreaths, &c., and assigned to each his\nshare] bids them eat:\n\nDuring the night the sacrificer and his wife have to remain awake and keep up\nthe fire. When the night clears up, the Adhvaryu extinguishes the fire, or, if\nthere is to be a Dakshi _n_ agni, he takes it southwards and keeps it in a\nsafe place till that fire is made up. He then draws with the wooden sword\nthree lines across the fire-place and proceeds with the preparation of the\nhearth-mounds in the way set forth in the first Brahma _n_ a of this Book.\n\n2:1:1:11\\. Now when he equips (Agni, the fire) from this and that quarter,\nthat is the equipping (of the fire) with its equipments 1. In whatever\n(objects) some of (the nature of) Agni is inherent, therewith he equips (the\nfire); and in thus equipping it he supplies it partly with splendour, partly\nwith cattle, partly with a mate.\n\n2:1:1:22\\. In the first place he (the Adhvaryu) draws (three) lines (with the\nwooden sword on the Garhapatya fire-place 2). Whatever part of this earth\n\np. 277\n\nis either trodden or spit upon, that he thereby removes from it; and he thus\nestablishes his fire on earth that is entirely proper for the sacrifice: this\nis why he draws lines (across the fire-place).\n\n2:1:1:33\\. He then sprinkles (the lines) with water. When he thus sprinkles\n(the fire-place) with water, that is the equipment (of the fire) with water.\nThe reason why he brings water is that water is food; for water is indeed\nfood: hence when water comes to this world, food is produced here. Thus he\nthereby supplies it (the fire) with food.\n\n2:1:1:44\\. Water (ap, fem.), moreover, is female, and fire (agni, masc.) is\nmale; so that he thereby supplies the latter with a productive mate. And since\nall this (universe) is pervaded (or obtained, apta) by water, he sets up the\nfire, after he has obtained it by means of water 1. This is why he brings\nwater.\n\n2:1:1:55\\. He then brings (a piece of) gold. Now Agni at one time cast his\neyes on the waters 2: \'May I pair with them,\' he thought. He came together\nwith them; and his seed became gold 3. For this reason the latter shines like\nfire, it being Agni\'s\n\np. 278\n\nseed. Hence it (gold) is found in water, for he (Agni) poured it into the\nwater. Hence also one does not cleanse oneself with it 1, nor does one do\nanything else with it. Now there is splendour (for the fire): for he thereby\nmakes it to be possessed of divine seed, bestows splendour on it; and sets up\na fire completely endowed with seed. That is why he brings gold.\n\n2:1:1:66\\. He then brings salt. Yonder sky assuredly bestowed that (salt as)\ncattle on this earth: hence they say that salt soil is suitable for cattle.\nThat (salt), therefore, means cattle; and thus he thereby visibly supplies it\n(the fire) with cattle; and the latter having come from yonder (sky) is\nsecurely established on this earth. Moreover, that (salt) is believed to be\nthe savour (rasa) of those two, the sky and the earth 2: so that he thereby\nsupplies it (the fire) with the savour of those two, the sky and the earth.\nThat is why he brings salt.\n\n2:1:1:77\\. He then brings (the earth of) a mole-hill (akhu-karisha) 3. The\nmoles certainly know the\n\np. 279\n\nsavour of this earth: hence, by entering deeper and deeper into this earth,\nthey (grow) very fat, knowing, as they do, its savour; and wherever they know\nthe savour of this earth to be, there they cast it up. Hence he thereby\nsupplies it (the fire) with the savour of this earth: that is why he brings a\nmolehill. Moreover, they say of one who has attained prosperity (or splendour,\n_s_ ri) that he is purishya; and purisha and karisha 1 doubtless mean one and\nthe same thing: it is, therefore, for his (Agni\'s or the sacrificer\'s)\nattainment of splendour ( _s_ ri) that he brings a mole-hill.\n\n2:1:1:88\\. He then brings pebbles. Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them\nsprung from Pra _g_ apati, once contended for superiority. This earth was then\ntrembling like a lotus-leaf; for the wind was tossing it hither and thither:\nnow it came near the gods, now it came near the Asuras. When it came near the\ngods,--\n\n2:1:1:99\\. They said, \'Come, let us steady this resting-place; and when firm\nand steady, let us set up\n\np. 280\n\nthe two fires on it; whereupon we will exclude our enemies from any share in\nit.\'\n\n2:1:1:1010\\. Accordingly, in like manner as one would stretch a skin by means\nof wooden pins, they fastened down this resting-place; and it formed a firm\nand steady resting-place. And when it was firm and steady, they set up the two\nfires on it; and thereupon they excluded their enemies from any share in it 1.\n\n2:1:1:1111\\. And in like manner that one (the Adhvaryu) now fastens down that\nresting-place by means of pebbles; and on it, when firm and steady, he sets up\nthe two fires; whereupon he excludes the (sacrificer\'s) enemies from any share\nin it. This is the reason why he brings pebbles.\n\n2:1:1:1212\\. These then are the five equipments 2: for fivefold is the\nsacrifice, fivefold the animal victim; and five seasons there are in the year.\n\np. 281\n\n2:1:1:1313\\. Now, as to this, they say, \'Six seasons there are in the year.\'\nAnd in that case the very deficiency (nyuna) itself is rendered a productive\nunion 1, since it is from the lower part (nyuna, i.e. of the body) that\noffspring is here brought forth. Thus also a progressive improvement 2 (is\nassured to the sacrificer): for this reason there are five equipments. And\nwhen (it is nevertheless insisted on that) there are six seasons in the year,\nthen Agni is the sixth of them, and thus there is no deficiency.\n\n2:1:1:1414\\. Here also they say, \'He should not equip it even with a single\nequipment!\' For (they argue) all those (objects) are on this earth, and hence,\nwhen he establishes the fire on this earth, the latter of itself obtains all\nthose equipments: he need not, therefore, equip it with a single equipment.\nBut let him nevertheless bring (those objects) together; for when he\nestablishes the fire on this (earth), then it obtains all the equipments: and\nwhat (benefit) accrues from the equipments being brought together, that also\naccrues to it 3. Let him for that reason bring (the objects) together.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[276:1](sbe1240.htm#fr_638) The verb here translated by \'to equip,\' is sam-bh\n_ri_ , \'to carry, or bring, together, to collect;\' and then \'to make the\nnecessary preparations, to prepare;\' hence sambhara, \'the preparation,\noutfit,\' the technical term for the objects employed in the preparation of the\nfire-place, with the view of symbolically ensuring success to the fire. In\nparagraphs 3 seq. the primary meaning \'to bring (together)\' has been used,\nexcept where it seemed desirable to preserve its technical sense.\n\n[276:2](sbe1240.htm#fr_639) The three lines drawn across the fire-place form a\nnecessary part of its lustration; see [p. 2](sbe1203.htm#page_2). According to\nthe Paddhati on Katy. IV, 8, the Adhvaryu first makes the fivefold lustration\nof the hearth, and thereupon again draws the mystic lines (? or draws the\noutline of the fire-place, cf. Katy. IV, 8, 16) and proceeds with the\nsambharas; viz. he sprinkles the lines with water, while the sacrificer takes\nhold of him from behind; then puts down a piece of gold, and on it throws salt\nsoil and the mould of a molehill, with which he forms the hearth-mound\n(khara)--circular in p. 277 the case of the Garhapatya, square the \xc3\x82havaniya,\nand semicircular the Dakshi _n_ agni; but each equal in area to a square\naratni or cubit. Along the edge of the mound he then lays pebbles close to\neach other [50 on the Garhapatya, 73 on the \xc3\x82havaniya, and 22 on the Dakshi\n_n_ agni, according to the Schol. on Katy. IV, 8, 16]. According to some\nauthorities, the piece of gold is laid on the top of the mound. He thus\nprepares successively the Garhapatya, \xc3\x82havaniya, and Dakshi _n_ a hearths;\nafterwards, if required, those of the Sabhya and Avasathya fires, which are,\nlike the Garhapatya, of circular form.\n\n[277:1](sbe1240.htm#fr_640) An etymological play on the word ap, apa _h_ ,\n\'water,\' and the verb ap, \'to obtain, pervade.\'\n\n[277:2](sbe1240.htm#fr_641) In the version of this myth given Taitt. Br. I, 1,\n3, 8, the waters courted by Agni are called Varu _n_ a\'s wives.\n\n[277:3](sbe1240.htm#fr_642) Ta _h_ sambabhuva tasu reta _h_ prasi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ at\ntad hira _n_ yam abhavat.\n\n[278:1](sbe1240.htm#fr_643) Saya _n_ a interprets enena na dhavayati by \'he\ndoes not clean (his teeth) with it;\'--the St. Petersb. Dict. by \'he does not\nget himself conveyed (driven) by it.\' The Ka _n_ va text has: Tasmad enad apsv\nevanuvindanty apsu punanty apsu by enat prasi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ an nainena dhavayanti na\nki _m_ _k_ ana kurvanti.\n\n[278:2](sbe1240.htm#fr_644) Cf. Taitt. Br. I, 1, 3, 2: \'The sky and the earth\nwere (originally) close together. On being separated they said to each other,\n"Let there he a common sacrificial essence (ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iyam) for us!" What\nsacrificial essence there was belonging to yonder sky, that it bestowed on\nthis earth, that became the salt (in the earth); and what sacrificial essence\nthere was belonging to this earth, that it bestowed on yonder sky, that became\nthe black (spots) in the moon. When he throws salt (on the fire-place), let\nhim think it to be that (viz. the black in the moon): it is on the sacrificial\nessence of the sky and the earth that he sets up his fire.\'\n\n[278:3](sbe1240.htm#fr_645) On the mythic connection of (the white, sharp\nteeth of) the p. 279 akhu (mole, mouse, rat), as of that of the boar, with the\nthunderbolt, see Dr. A. Kuhn\'s ingenious remarks, \'Herabkunft des Feuers and\ndes Gottertranks,\' p. 202. According to Taitt. Br. I, 1, 3, 3, Agni at one\ntime concealed himself from the gods, and having become a mole, dug himself\ninto the earth; so that the mole-hills thrown up by him, have some of Agni\'s\nnature attaching to them. The Taittiriyas also put on the hearth the earth of\nan ant-hill, which the Brahma _n_ a (in the same way as our author does of the\nmolehill) represents as the savour (or marrow, essence) of the earth.\n\n[279:1](sbe1240.htm#fr_646) The primary meaning of karisha is \'that which is\nscattered, or strewn about,\' hence \'refuse, rubbish\' (and akhu-karisha, \'mole-\ncast\'). Its secondary meaning, as is that of purisha, is \'manure\' (or perhaps\nalso \'soft, rich mould\'), an article naturally valued by an agricultural\npopulation. See I, 2, 5, 17, where purisha is taken symbolically to represent\ncattle.\n\n[280:1](sbe1240.htm#fr_647) The corresponding myth of Taitt. Br. I, 1, 3, 5,\nthough very different from ours, yet presents one or two points of\nresemblance. According to it, nothing was to be seen in the beginning except\nwater and a lotus-leaf standing out above it. Pra _g_ apati (being bent on\ncreating the firm ground) bethought himself that the lotus-stalk must rest on\nsomething; and having assumed the form of a boar, he dived and brought up some\nof the earth. This he spread out (prath) on the lotus-leaf, whence originated\nthe earth (p _ri_ thivi), which he then fastened down by means of pebbles.\nHence the latter are put on the hearth in order to afford a firm foundation\nfor the fire.\n\n[280:2](sbe1240.htm#fr_648) According to the authorities of the Black Ya _g_\nur-veda there are not five, but fourteen sambharas, seven of which are taken\nfrom the earth, viz. sand, salt, a mole-hill, an ant-hill, mire from a dried-\nup pool, pebbles, and gold; while the remaining seven consist of pieces of\nwood from the a _s_ vattha, udumbara, pala _s_ a (? two pieces), _s_ ami, and\nvikankata trees, and from some tree that has been struck by lightning. The\nsprinkling of water about the fire-place is not counted by them as a sambhara,\nbut as one of the usual acts of lustration. Taitt. Br. I, 1, 3 seq.\n\n[281:1](sbe1240.htm#fr_649) Or, a deficient pairing is effected (on account of\nthe uneven number). I do not quite understand Saya _n_ a\'s interpretation of\nthe passage, the published text of the commentary being apparently corrupt in\none or two places, The Ka _n_ va text reads: Tad ahu _h_ sha _d_ va _ri_ tava\n_h_ sa _m_ vatsarasyeti yadi vai sha _l_ _ri_ tava _h_ sa _m_ vatsarasya\nnyunam u vai pra _g_ anana _m_ nyunad va imah pra _g_ a _h_ pra _g_ ayante,\n&c.\n\n[281:2](sbe1240.htm#fr_650) Literally, \'a prevailing (or advancing) better-to-\nmorrow,\' _s_ va _h_ _s_ reyasam uttaravat.\n\n[281:3](sbe1240.htm#fr_651) The drift of the author\'s reasoning evidently is\nthat it is safer, by putting those objects on the fire-place, to make sure of\nthe magic benefits of those symbols being really secured to the fire, and\nthereby to the sacrificer. The Ka _n_ va text of this paragraph, though\ndifferently worded, yields the same sense; except that it refers to p. 282 the\nsacrificer himself and to the wishes he entertains in collecting the objects.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 2.
