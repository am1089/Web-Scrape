XIII.\n\nOf \xc5\x9araddhas, or rites in honour of ancestors, to be performed on occasions of\nrejoicing. Obsequial ceremonies. Of the Ekoddisht\xcc\x81a or monthly \xc5\x9araddha, and\nthe Sapin\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ana or annual one. By whom to be performed.\n\nAURVA continued.--"The bathing of a father without disrobing is enjoined when\na son is born; and he is to celebrate the ceremony proper for the event, which\nis the \xc5\x9araddha offered upon joyous occasions 1. With composed mind, and\nthinking on nothing else, the Brahman should offer worship to both the gods\nand progenitors, and should respectfully circumambulate, keeping Brahmans on\nhis left hand, and give them food. Standing with his face to the east, he\nshould present, with the\n\np. 315\n\nparts of the hand sacred to the gods and to Prajapati, balls of food 2, with\ncurds, unbruised grain, and jujubes; and should perform, on every accession of\ngood fortune, the rite by which the class of progenitors termed Nandimukha is\npropitiated 3. A householder should diligently worship the Pitris so named, at\nthe marriage of a son or daughter, on entering a new dwelling, on giving a\nname to a child, on performing his tonsure and other purificatory ceremonies,\nat the binding of the mother\'s hair during gestation, or on first seeing the\nface of a son, or the like.\n\np. 316\n\n[paragraph continues] The \xc5\x9araddha on such occasions, however, has been briefly\nalluded to. Hear now, oh king, the rules for the performance of obsequial\nrites.\n\n"Having washed the corpse with holy water, decorated it with garlands, and\nburnt it without the village, the kinsmen, having bathed with their clothes\non, are to stand with their faces to the south, and offer libations to the\ndeceased, addressing him by name, and adding, \'wherever thou mayest be 4.\'\nThey then return, along with the cattle coming from pasture, to the village;\nand upon the appearance of the stars retire to rest, sleeping on mats spread\nupon the earth. Every day (whilst the mourning lasts) a cake or ball of food 5\nis to be placed on the ground, as an offering to the deceased; and rice,\nwithout flesh, is to be daily eaten. Brahmans are to be fed for as many days\nas the mourner pleases, for the soul of the defunct derives satisfaction\naccordingly as his relatives are content with their entertainment. On the\nfirst day, or the third, or seventh, or ninth (after the death of a person),\nhis kinsmen should change their raiment, and bathe out of doors, and offer a\nlibation of water, with (tila) sesamum-seeds. On the fourth day 6 the ashes\nand bones should be collected: after which the body of one connected with the\ndeceased by offerings of funeral cakes may be touched (by an indifferent\nperson), without thereby incurring impurity; and those who are related only by\npresentation of water are qualified for any occupation 7.\n\np. 317\n\n[paragraph continues] The former class of relatives may use beds, but they\nmust still refrain from unguents and flowers, and must observe continence,\nafter the ashes and bones have been collected (until the mourning is over).\nWhen the deceased is a child, or one who is abroad, or who has been degraded,\nor a spiritual preceptor, the period of uncleanness is but brief, and the\nceremonies with fire and water are discretional. The food of a family in which\na kinsman is deceased is not to be partaken of for ten days 8; and during that\nperiod, gifts, acceptance, sacrifice, and sacred study are suspended. The term\nof impurity for a Brahman is ten days; for a Kshatriya, twelve; for a Vai\xc5\x9bya,\nhalf a month; and a whole month for a \xc5\x9audra 9. On the first day after\nuncleanness ceases, the nearest relation of the deceased should feed Brahmans\nat his pleasure, but in uneven numbers, and offer to the deceased a ball of\nrice upon holy grass placed near the residue of the food that has been eaten.\nAfter the guests have been fed, the mourner, according to his caste, is to\ntouch water, a weapon, a goad, or a staff, as he is purified by such contact.\nHe may then resume the duties prescribed for his caste, and follow the\navocation ordinarily pursued by its members.\n\n"The \xc5\x9araddha enjoined for an individual is to be repeated on the day of his\ndeath (in each month for a year) 10, but without the prayers and rites\nperformed on the first occasion, and without offerings to the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas. A\nsingle ball of food is to be offered to the deceased, as the purification of\none person, and Brahmans are to be fed. The Brahmans are to be asked by the\nsacrificer if they are satisfied; and upon their assent, the prayer, \'May this\never satisfy such a one\' (the deceased) is to be recited.\n\np. 318\n\n"This is the \xc5\x9araddha called Ekoddisht\xcc\x81a, which is to be performed monthly to\nthe end of a twelvemonth from the death of a person; at the expiration of\nwhich the ceremony called Sapin\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ana is to be observed. The practices of this\nrite are the same as those of the monthly obsequies, but a lustration is to be\nmade with four vessels of water, perfumes, and sesamum: one of these vessels\nis considered as dedicated to the deceased, the other three to the progenitors\nin general; and the contents of the former are to be transferred to the other\nthree, by which the deceased becomes included in the class of ancestors, to\nwhom worship is to be addressed with all the ceremonies of the \xc5\x9araddha. The\npersons who are competent to perform the obsequies of relations connected by\nthe offering of the cake are the son, grandson, great grandson, a kinsman of\nthe deceased, the descendants of a brother, or the posterity of one allied by\nfuneral offerings. In absence of all these, the ceremony may be instituted by\nthose related by presentations of water only, or those connected by offerings\nof cakes or water to maternal ancestors. Should both families in the male line\nbe extinct, the last obsequies may be performed by women, or by the associates\nof the deceased in religious or social institutions, or by any one who becomes\npossessed of the property of a deceased kinsman.\n\n"Obsequial rites are of three descriptions, initiative, intermediate, and\nsubsequent 11. The first are those which are observed after the burning of the\ncorpse until the touching of water, weapons, &c. (or until the cessation of\nuncleanness). The intermediate ceremonies are the Sraddhas called Ekoddisht\xcc\x81a,\nwhich are offered every month: and the subsequent rites are those which follow\nthe Sapin\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ikaran\xcc\x81a, when the deceased is admitted amongst the ancestors of\nhis race; and the ceremonies are thenceforth general or ancestral. The first\nset of rites (as essential) are to be performed by the kindred of the father\nor mother, whether connected by the offering of the cake or of water, by the\nassociates of the deceased, or by the prince who inherits his property.\n\np. 319\n\n[paragraph continues] The first and the last rites are both to be performed by\nsons and other relations, and by daughter\'s sons, and their sons; and so are\nthe sacrifices on the day of the person\'s death. The last class, or ancestral\nrites, are to be performed annually, with the same ceremonies as are enjoined\nfor the monthly obsequies; and they may be also performed by females. As the\nancestral rights are therefore most universal, I will describe to you, oh\nking, at what seasons, and in what manner, they should be celebrated."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[314:1](vp087.htm#fr_867) The offerings of the Hindus to the Pitris partake of\nthe character of those of the Romans to the lares and manes, but bear a more\nconspicuous part in their ritual. They are said indeed by Manu (III. 203), in\nwords repeated in the Vayu and Matsya Puran\xcc\x81as and Hari Van\xc5\x9ba, to be of more\nmoment than the worship of the gods: These ceremonies are not to be regarded\nas merely obsequial; for independently of the rites addressed to a recently\ndeceased relative, and in connexion with him to remote ancestors and to the\nprogenitors of all beings, which are of a strictly obsequial or funereal\ndescription, offerings to deceased ancestors, and the Pitris in general, form\nan essential ceremony on a great variety of festive and domestic occasions.\nThe Nirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu, in a passage referred to by Mr. Colebrooke (As. Res.\nVII.), specifies the following \xc5\x9araddhas: 1. The Nitya, or perpetual; daily\nofferings to ancestors in general: 2. The Naimittika, or occasional; as the\nEkoddisht\xcc\x81a,or obsequial offerings on account of a kinsman recently deceased:\n3. The Kamya, voluntary; performed for the accomplishment of a special design:\n4. The Vriddhi; performed on occasions of rejoicing or prosperity: 5. The\nSapin\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ana; offerings to all individual and to general ancestors: 6. The\nParvan\xcc\x81a \xc5\x9araddha; offerings to the manes on certain lunar days called Parvas,\nor day of full moon and new moon, and the eighth and fourteenth days of the\nlunar fortnight: 7. The Gosht\xcc\x81hi; for the advantage of a number of learned\npersons, or of an assembly of Brahmans, invited for the purpose: 8. The\n\xc5\x9auddhi; one performed to purify a person from some defilement; an expiatory\n\xc5\x9araddha: 9. The Karmanga; one forming part of the initiatory ceremonies, or\nSanskaras, observed at conception, birth, tonsure, &c.: 10. The Daiva; to\nwhich the gods are invited: 11. The Yatra \xc5\x9araddha; held by a person going a\njourney: and 12. The Pusht\xcc\x81i \xc5\x9araddha; one performed to promote health and p.\n315 wealth. Of these, the four which are considered the most solemn are the\nrite performed for a parent, or near relative, lately deceased; that which is\nperformed for kindred collectively; that observed on certain lunar days; and\nthat celebrated on occasions of rejoicing. Nirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu, p. 271.\n\n[315:2](vp087.htm#fr_868) Manu directs the balls to be made from the remainder\nof the clarified butter constituting the previous oblation to the gods. III.\n215. Kulluka Bhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a explains, however, the oblation to consist partly of\nAnna food, or boiled rice. The latter is the article of which the balls\nchiefly consist. Yajnawalkya directs them to be made of rice and sesamum-\nseeds. The Vayu P. adds to these two ingredients, honey and butter: but\nvarious kinds of fruit, of pulse, and of grain, and water, frankincense,\nsugar, and milk, are also mixed up in the Pin\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as. Their size also differs;\nand according to Angiras, as quoted by Hemadri in the \xc5\x9araddha Mayukha, they\nmay be of the dimension of the fruit of the jujube, or of the hog-plum, of the\nfruit of the Bel, or of the wood-apple, or of a fowl\'s egg. Some authorities\ndirect Pin\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as of a different size for different \xc5\x9araddhas; prescribing them\nno larger than the wood-apple at the first or pure funereal ceremony, and as\nbig as a cocoa-nut at the monthly and annual \xc5\x9araddha. In practice the Pin\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a\nis usually of such a magnitude that it may be conveniently held by the hand.\n\n[315:3](vp087.htm#fr_869) We have here the authority of the text for classing\nthe Nandimukhas amongst the Pitris (see p. 297): the verse is ###, and the\nsame Gan\xcc\x81a or class is presently again named: ### The Mantra of the Vriddhi or\nfestival \xc5\x9araddha is also said, in the Nirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu, to be ###. According to\nthe authorities, however, which are cited in that work, there seems to be some\nuncertainty about the character of the Nandimukhas; and they are addressed\nboth as Pitris and gods: being in the former case either the ancestors prior\nto the great grandfather, ancestors collectively, or a certain class of them;\nand in the latter, being identified with the Vi\xc5\x9bwadevas, or a class of them\ncalled also \xc3\x9arddhavaktra. The term Nandimukha is also applied to the rite\nitself, or to the Vriddhi \xc5\x9araddha, and to one addressed to maternal ancestors.\nNirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu, p. 268, &c.\n\n[316:4](vp087.htm#fr_870) "An oblation of water must be next presented from\nthe joined palms of the hand, naming the deceased and the family from which he\nsprang, and saying, \'May this oblation reach thee.\'" As. Res. VII. 244. The\ntext has, ###.\n\n[316:5](vp087.htm#fr_871) The proper period of mourning is ten days, on each\nof which offerings of cakes, and libations of water, are to be made to the\ndeceased, augmenting the number of cakes each day, so that on the last day ten\ncakes are presented. When the period is shorter, the same number of ten cakes\nmust be distributed amongst the several days, or they may be all presented on\none day. Nirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu, p. 429.\n\n[316:6](vp087.htm#fr_872) It should be, more correctly, on that day on which\nthe mourning ceases, or, as previously mentioned, the first, third, seventh,\nor ninth; but the authorities vary, and, besides these, the second and fourth\ndays, and certain days of the fortnight or month, are specified. Nirn\xcc\x81aya\nSindhu, p. 432.\n\n[316:7](vp087.htm#fr_873) They are no longer unclean. The Sapin\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as, or those\nconnected by offerings of cakes to common ancestors, extend to seven degrees,\nascending or descending. The Samanodakas, or those similarly connected by\npresentations of water, to fourteen degrees.\n\n[317:8](vp087.htm#fr_874) That is, a mere guest or stranger is not to partake\nof it. The food directed to be given to Brahmans is given in general only to\nthe relatives of the deceased, who are already unclean. In this respect our\ntext and the modern practice seem to differ from the primitive system, as\ndescribed by Manu, III. 187. The eleventh or twelfth day is the term on which\nthe \xc5\x9araddha which crowns the whole of the funeral rites is to be performed,\nand when Brahmans are to be invited. Nirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu, p. 437.\n\n[317:9](vp087.htm#fr_875) The number of Pin\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81as, however, is for each case\nthe same, or ten. Nirn\xcc\x81aya Sindhu, p. 429.\n\n[317:10](vp087.htm#fr_876) So Manu, III. 251. It may be doubted if the monthly\n\xc5\x9araddha was part p. 318 of the ancient system, although Kulluka Bhat\xcc\x81t\xcc\x81a\nsupposes it to be referred to (v. 548), and supplies the fancied omission of\nthe text.\n\n[318:11](vp087.htm#fr_877) Purva, \'first;\' Madhyama, \'middle;\' and Uttara,\n\'last.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIV](vp088.htm)\n\n'
