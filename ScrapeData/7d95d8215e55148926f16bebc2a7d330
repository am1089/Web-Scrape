Even if we admit (the Sa _n_ khya position refuted in what precedes, it is\ninvalidated by other objections) on account of the absence of a purpose (on\nthe part of the pradhana).\n\nEven if we, accommodating ourselves to your (the Sa _n_ khya's) belief, should\nadmit what has been disproved in the preceding Sutra, viz. that the pradhana\nis spontaneously active, still your opinion would lie open to an objection 'on\naccount of the absence of a purpose.' For if the spontaneous activity of the\npradhana has, as you say, no reference to anything else, it will have no\nreference not only to any aiding principle, but also to any purpose or motive,\nand consequently your doctrine that the pradhana is active in order to effect\nthe purpose of man will become untenable. If you reply that the pradhana does\nnot indeed regard any aiding principle, but does regard a purpose, we remark\nthat in that case we must distinguish between the different possible purposes,\nviz. either enjoyment (on the part of the soul), or final release, or both. If\nenjoyment, what enjoyment, we ask, can belong to the soul which is naturally\nincapable of any accretion (of pleasure or pain) 1? Moreover, there would in\nthat case be no opportunity for release 2.--If release, then the activity of\nthe pradhana would be purposeless, as even antecedently to it the soul is in\nthe\n\np. 373\n\nstate of release; moreover, there would then be no occasion for the perception\nof sounds, &c. 1\\--If both, then, on account of the infinite number of the\nobjects of pradhana to be enjoyed (by the soul) 2, there would be no\nopportunity for final release. Nor can the satisfaction of a desire be\nconsidered as the purpose of the activity of the pradhana; for neither the\nnon-intelligent pradhana nor the essentially pure soul can feel any desire.--\nIf, finally, you should assume the pradhana to be active, because otherwise\nthe power of sight (belonging to the soul on account of its intelligent\nnature) and the creative power (belonging to the pradhana) would be\npurposeless; it would follow that, as the creative power of the pradhana does\nnot cease at any time any more than the soul's power of sight docs, the\napparent world would never come to an end, so that no final release of the\nsoul could take place 3.--It is, therefore, impossible to maintain that the\npradhana enters on its activity for the purposes of the soul.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[372:1](sbe34182.htm#fr_331) Anadheyati _s_ ayasya\nsukhadukhapraptiparihararupati _s_ aya _s_ unyasyety artha _h_. \xc3\x82n.
