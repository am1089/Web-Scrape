There are eighty-four Asans. Some of them are used to retain youth;\nothers are used to produce calm, peace and harmony.\n\n#### THE PRATYAHARE YOGA\n\nThis Yoga is the best for controlling lust, passions, etc. It is used to stop\nthe thinking principle, or bring the mind under control. The lower mind is\nignorance itself, and until this fluttering mind is made to come to one point,\nthe blessed state of peace cannot be attained.\n\nAll danger is caused by ignorance. There is no danger that comes from wisdom.\n\n"He is mightier who controls his spirit, than he who conquers the city."\n\nAll the dangers come from uncontrolled mind. If every one would control the\nmind, all the miseries of this world would cease. All inharmony in the home is\ncaused by lack of understanding of each other, and uncontrolled thoughts.\n\nWhen people learn to control themselves and understand each other, then the\npoor Judge of the divorce courts will be relieved.\n\np. 43\n\n#### MUDRAS MOVE THE KUNDALINI\n\nThere are Eighty-four Mudras in Yoga.\n\nWhy do Yogins practice Mudras and the five Dharanas?\n\nTo control the five Life or Vital Forces that are working in the human body.\nWhen these five forces are controlled, Yogins attain emancipation, or\nliberation.\n\nWhat are the five forces and from whence they come?\n\nThe names of these forces are: Prana, Apana, Samana, Vyana, and Udana, and\nthey come from the Kundalini. They are part of the Kundalini\'s energy\n(dynamic).\n\nThrough Mudras the Yogins succeed in gathering these five forces together,\nbringing them to their home, the Mother Kundalini, which is sleeping at the\nMuladhara Chakra, as Static energy of the Mother of the Universe. Yogins force\nthe Prana and Apana to the place where this Static energy of the Kundalini is\nsleeping. Thus they awaken her.\n\nFirst. The Earth Dharana. "When the Yogin opens the \'Earth Chakra\' by the\npower of the Kundalini, he conquers the earth,\n\np. 44\n\nand no earthly element can injure him. He walks over the land, freed from\ndeath."\n\nSecond. The Water Dharana. "Next the Yogin moves the Kundalini energy up to\nthe second Chakra--the \'Water Chakra\'. By opening this Chakra the Yogin is\nfree from all sorrow, no water can ever harm him. Although he be thrown in the\ndeepest water, "he will never die in the water." This Mudra should be kept\nvery carefully secret, as by revealing this, success is lost."\n\nThird, The Fire Dharana. "The Yogin should move the Kundalini energy up to the\n\'Fire Chakra.\' When the Yogin opens this Chakra, known as Fire Dharana--the\nkiller of the fear of death--then "fire can not harm or burn the Yogin." What\nelse is there for him to fear?"\n\nFourth, The Air Dharana. "The Yogin opens this Chakra by bringing the\nKundalini energy upward, and as soon as he has succeeded in opening the \'Air\nChakra,\' he has mastered levitation. This Mudra is the destroyer of death, and\nthe Yogin will never be disturbed by air. This can not be taught to the\nfaithless; by doing so all success would be lost."\n\np. 45\n\nFifth, The Ether Dharana. "Here the Yogin moves the energy of the Mother\nKundalini upward and opens the \'Ether Chakra.\' As soon as he is successful in\nopening this Chakra, he has opened the door of liberation or emancipation--he\nwill never die unless he wills it."\n\n"When the Yogin has learned the five Dharanas, the human body can visit and\nre-visit the Heavens, and he can go wherever he likes, as swiftly as the mind.\n\n"Yogins should also practice the Bhastrika Kumbhaka. That, too, will awaken\nthe Kundalini. He should move or awaken the Kundalini again and again, and\nthough he be in the mouth of death, he need not fear it.\n\n"When the Apana rises upward to the \'Fire Chakra,\' the flame of divine fire\ngrows strong and bright, being fanned by Apana. When the Apana fire mixes with\nthe Prana, which is naturally hot, the spiritual heat of the body becomes\nbright and powerful." When the Kundalini feels this extra heat, she will\nawaken from sleep; then she goes into the Sushumna. As a key can open a door,\nso Yogi should open the door of liberation by awakening the Kundalini. The\n\np. 46\n\n[paragraph continues] Kundalini is coiled like a serpent, and by Mudra or\nPranayama processes the Kundalini will certainly move and open the mouth of\nthe Sushumna.\n\n"Without moving the Kundalini, there are no other means that will clear away\nthe impurities of the 7200 Nadis.\n\n"Yogins should practice the Bhastrika Kumbhaka, three hours daily; then he\nneed have no fear of death.\n\n"The Great Goddess Kundalini, the Energy of the Self, sleeps in the Muladhara.\nShe has the form of a serpent, having three coils and a half. As long as she\nis asleep in the body, (finer body), the jiva is a mere animal, and true\nwisdom does not arise, though Yogi may practice ten million Yoga.\n\n"When Kundalini is sleeping it is awakened by the kind Guru (the spiritual\nteacher); then all the Chakra\'s knots are pierced, and the Prana then goes\nthru the Sushumna. The mind is then controlled, and the Yogi arises above\ndeath. Yogi should practice daily some of the following Mudras: Maha Mudra,\nNabho Mudra, Udiyana, Maha Bandha, Maha Vedha, Kechari, Jalandhara, Yoni,\nViparitakarna, Kaki, Sambhavi\n\np. 47\n\nand others.\n\n"Maha Mudra should be practiced with the Jalanhara Bandha. Practice of this\nMudra will cure fever, bowel trouble, enlargement of the spleen, indigestion,\nconsumption, leprosy and any other diseases. It will awaken the Kundalini. It\nis called the Great Mudra by the wise. Practice of the Mudras should be equal\non both sides.\n\n"The Nabho Mudra should be practiced, and it is easy to practice. It, too,\nmakes the Yogi safe from all diseases, and the body never becomes old but\nkeeps perpetual youth.\n\n"The Maha Bandha Mudra should be practiced with Jalandhara Mudra, which will\nbring the Prana downward. He who practices this Mudra will control the Prana\nand Aprana and move the Kundalini.\n\n"The Maha Vedha Mudra is the best Mudra to awaken the Kundalini, but should be\npracticed with the Bandha and Maha Bandha. It gives success to Yogi over all\nnature\'s finer forces.\n\n"Yogi should practice in secret, and not tell any one if he desires success.\n\n"The Udiyana, or Flying Up Mudra, moves the Goddess Kundalini, and who masters\nthis Mudra will be Master of all\n\np. 48\n\npowers, like levitation, etc. This Mudra makes it easy to attain emancipation,\nand is the key that unlocks the door of liberation.\n\n"The Mula Bandha Mudra is the best Mudra to control the Apana and Prana, and\nis the key to everlasting youth. Mixing the Prana and Apana causes heat in the\nbody; that heat causes the Kundalini to awaken--then she goes upward thru the\nSushumna. In that Sushumna all wisdom and powers are.\n\n"Jalandhara Mudra is the well tried Mudra for keeping old age, decay and death\naway. It saves the nectar and keeps the vital force moving in the right Nadi.\nWho practices this Mudra daily, becomes an adept. Yogi should practice Maha\nBandha, Udiyana and Jalandhara all at once.\n\n"Khechari Mudra is the King of all the \'Mudras. It is hard to attain. The Yogi\nwho masters it even for half an hour, will overcome hunger, thirst, decay and\ndeath--his body becomes divine. The earth, water, fire, air and ether can not\nharm that body. Yoni Mudra, Viparitakaran Mudra, Vajroni Mudra, Sakti Mudra,\nManduki Mudra and Sambhavi Mudra are well tried, and will awaken the\nKundalini.\n\np. 49\n\n"The five Dharanas should be learned from a Master. With these Dharanas a Yogi\ngoes wherever he wants to with his physical body; he may go to Heaven, walk on\nwater, air and fire. and is Master of All. Except for the practice of\nKundalini, what other means ate there to purify the Nadis? Once setting this\npower moving, Yogi should practice constantly. Who can practice a yama, need\nhave no fear of death. Hatha Yoga and Raja Yoga should be practiced together,\nas Hatha Yoga is dependent upon Raja Yoga and Raja Yoga is dependent upon\nHatha Yoga. These Mudras should not be taught to the wicked and faithless, but\nthey should be taught to calm, peaceful and faithful students. And he who\nteaches the secret of the Mudras is the real Guru. He can be called Ishwar\n(God), in human form.\n\n"What more shall tell, O Devi? There is nothing in this world like the Mudras\nto attain the human goal quickly and successfully."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Power of the Pranayama Yoga](kmu08.htm)\n\n'
