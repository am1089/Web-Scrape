The eater (is the highest Self) on account of there being taken all that\nis movable and immovable.\n\nWe read in the Ka _th_ avalli (I, 3, 25), 'Who then knows where he is to whom\nthe Brahmans and Kshattriyas are but food, and death itself a condiment? 'A\ndoubt here arises whether the 'eater', suggested by the words 'food' and\n'condiment,' is the individual soul or the highest Self.--The individual soul,\nthe Purvapakshin maintains; for all enjoyment presupposes works, and works\nbelong to the individual soul only.--Of this view the Sutra disposes. The\n'eater' can be the highest Self only, because the taking, i. e. eating, of the\nwhole aggregate of movable and immovable things can be predicated of that Self\nonly. 'Eating' does not here mean fruition dependent on work, but rather the\nact of reabsorption of the world on the part of the highest Brahman, i. e.\nVish _n_ u, who is the cause of the origination, subsistence, and final\ndestruction of the universe. This appears from the fact that Vish _n_ u is\nmentioned in the same section, 'He reaches the end of his journey, and that is\nthe highest place of Vish _n_ u' (Ka. Up. I, 3, 9). Moreover the clause 'to\nwhom death is a condiment' shows that by the Brahmans and Kshattriyas,\nmentioned in the text, we have to understand the whole universe of moving and\nnon-moving things, viewed as things to be consumed by the highest Self. For a\ncondiment is a thing which, while itself being eaten, causes other things to\nbe eaten; the meaning of the passage, therefore, is that while death itself is\nconsumed, being a condiment as it were, there is at the same time eaten\nwhatever is flavoured or made palatable by death, and that is the entire world\nof beings in which the Brahmans and Kshattriyas\n\np. 267\n\nhold the foremost place. Now such eating of course is destruction or\nreabsorption, and hence such enjoyment--meaning general reabsorption--can\nbelong to the highest Self only.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 10.
