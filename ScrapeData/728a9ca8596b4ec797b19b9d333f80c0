On the first of these nectars (the red light, which represents fame, glory\nof countenance, vigour, strength, health) the Vasus live, with Agni at their\nhead. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the\nnectar.\n\n2\\. They enter into that (red) colour, and they rise from that colour 1.\n\n3\\. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the Vasus, with Agni at\ntheir head, he sees the nectar and rejoices. And he, too, having entered that\ncolour, rises again from that colour.\n\n4\\. So long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west 2, so long does\nhe follow the sovereign supremacy of the Vasus.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[41:1](sbe01064.htm#fr_165) This is differently explained by the commentator.\nHe takes it to mean that, when the Vasus have gone to the sun, and see that\nthere is no opportunity for enjoying that colour, they rest; but when they see\nthat there is an opportunity for enjoying it, they exert themselves for it. I\nthink the colour is here taken for the colour of the morning, which the Vasus\nenter, and from which they go forth again.\n\n[41:2](sbe01064.htm#fr_166) 1\\. East: Vasus: red: Agni. 2.
