At this time, Narud Jee came and said to Indru, "O great\nking! every one obeys you, except the inhabitants of Bruj; and they do not\nobey you, because Nund has had a son, according to whose instructions they\nact. He has abolished your worship, and caused them since yesterday to worship\nthe mountain."\n\nOn hearing this Indru was angry, and said, "The inhabitants of Bruj have great\nwealth, and therefore they have become excessively proud. They have given up\nthe prayers, penances, sacrifices and fasts, which they used to observe, and\noffer up on my account. They have invited famine and wretchedness. They look\nupon the man, Krishnu, as a god: and believe all he says to be true. He is a\nfoolish, unintelligent child, a great talker, and very proud. I will now put\nan end to his pride by destroying all cattle, and deprive him of wealth."\n\np. 90\n\nHaving spoken in this angry, foolish manner, the ruler of the gods sent for\nthe lord of the clouds. On receiving the message, he came and stood before\nIndru trembling, and with his hands joined. Indru, when he saw him, said,\npassionately, "Take all your army immediately with you, and overwhelm with\nwater the mountain Goberdhun, and the space round about Bruj; so that not a\nsingle trace of the mountain, or the name of the inhabitants of Bruj may\nremain."\n\nHaving received this order, the lord of the clouds made his obeisance, and\nreceived permission from Raja Indru to depart. On reaching his own abode, he\ncalled together all the great clouds, and said to them, "It is the order of\nthe great king, that you should go immediately and pour down, rain in such\nquantities as to set adrift the whole of Goberdhun."\n\nHaving heard this, all the clouds collected their masses, and accompanied\ntheir ruler. He came and surrounded the whole country about Bruj; and having\nthundered, began to pour down heavy rain in large drops, and to point out the\nhill with his finger.\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja Pureechit,--O\ngreat king! when the thundering clouds began to pour down rain in this manner\nfrom all quarters, the cowherdesses and cowherds together with Nund and\nJusodha, alarmed and drenched with wet, trembled violently, and having gone to\nKrishnu called out, "O Krishnu! how shall we escape from this great deluge?\nYou made us abandon the worship of Indru, and perform poojah to the hill;\nplease call him quickly to preserve us: otherwise, we shall all be drowned in\na second, together with the city."\n\nHaving heard this speech, and perceiving that they were all terrified, Shree\nKrishnu Chund replied, "Be not at all anxious, the lord of hills will come\nimmediately and protect you." Thus saying, and heating the hill Goberdhun, he\nmade it like fire, and raised it up, and supported it on the little finger of\nhis left hand; upon this, all the inhabitants of Bruj with their\n\np. 91\n\ncattle came and stood under it, and on beholding Shree Krishnu, began to say\nwith astonishment to each other, "Some Vishnu has descended upon the earth;\nKrishnu is a god of gods. How, brother, can Mohun be a mortal, since he has\nsupported a hill upon his finger?"\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in the history, Shree Shookdeo, the Sage, said to\nthe Raja Pureechit,--The lord of the clouds, with his collected force and in\ngreat wrath, poured down rain very heavy, which fell upon the hill with a\nhissing sound, and became like drops falling upon a hot baking plate.\n\nHaving been informed of this Indru was enraged, and came himself and poured\ndown rain for seven days without ceasing; but through the glory of Huri, not a\ndrop fell upon Bruj. When all the water was expended, the clouds came with\njoined hands and said, "Lord! we have expended as much water as was expended\nat the general destruction (the great deluge,) what shall we do now?"\n\nHaving heard this, Indru reflecting and meditating, thought to himself,\n"Vishnu has descended upon the earth: otherwise, who else could have had the\npower, by supporting the hill, to protect Bruj?" With these thoughts, and\nfeeling great regret, Indru returned to his abode with the clouds, which\nhaving been dispersed, there was light. Then all the inhabitants of Bruj,\nbeing delighted, said to Krishnu, "O great king! be pleased now to restore the\nhill to its former position, as the clouds are all gone." On hearing which\nShree Krishnu Chund placed the hill where it was before.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXVII](psa28.htm)\n\n'
