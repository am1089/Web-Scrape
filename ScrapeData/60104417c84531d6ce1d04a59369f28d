A righteous man shall seek to dwell in a village where fuel, water,\nfodder, sacred fuel, Ku _s_ a grass, and garlands are plentiful, access to\nwhich is 31\n\np. 244\n\neasy, where many rich people dwell, which abounds in industrious people, where\n\xc3\x82ryans form the majority, and which is not easily entered by robbers.\n\n32\\. 'A Brahma _n_ a who, having wedded a wife of the _S_ udra caste and\ndwells during twelve years in a village where water (is obtainable) from wells\nonly, becomes equal to a _S_ udra.'\n\n33\\.

'I.e. he shall take up as much food only\nas he can swallow at one mouthful.'--Govinda.\n\n[241:2](sbe1460.htm#fr_1187) The Dekhan and Gu _g_ arat MSS., including K.,\nadd madhu, 'honey,' after sesamum.\n\n[241:3](sbe1460.htm#fr_1188) This and the following six Sutras are left out in\nM. and the two copies of the commentary. If they have, nevertheless, been\nreceived. into the text, the reason is that similar rules occur in all\nDharmasutras, and that Sutra 3 begins with astamite, while astamaye occurs in\nSutra 10. It seems therefore probable that the writer of the MS. from which M.\nand Govinda's copies are derived, skipped over a line by mistake.\n\n[241:4](sbe1460.htm#fr_1189)-7. Vasish _th_ a XII, 34-38.\n\n[242:8](sbe1460.htm#fr_1190) Vish _n_ u LXXI, 40.\n\n[242:9](sbe1460.htm#fr_1191) Vasish _th_ a XII, 39.\n\n[242:10](sbe1460.htm#fr_1192) Vasish _th_ a XII, 10.\n\n[242:11](sbe1460.htm#fr_1193)-12. Vasish _th_ a XII, 32-33.\n\n[242:13](sbe1460.htm#fr_1194) Govinda explains prakilaka by 'a piece of wood\nfastened at the town gate.' Etymologically it would mean 'a strong bolt.'\nPossibly the rule may be equivalent to \xc3\x82pastamba I, II, 31, 23, and mean that\na Snataka is not to creep through the small door which is found in all Indian\ntown gates, and left open after the gates have been shut.\n\n[242:14](sbe1460.htm#fr_1195) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 31, 16.\n\n[242:15](sbe1460.htm#fr_1196) Vasish _th_ a XII, 9.\n\n[242:16](sbe1460.htm#fr_1197) Gautama IX, 15; Manu IV, 132.\n\n[243:17](sbe1460.htm#fr_1198) Vish _n_ u LXXI, 62.\n\n[243:18](sbe1460.htm#fr_1199)-19. Gautama IX, 19.\n\n[243:20](sbe1460.htm#fr_1200) Manu IV, 177; Vish _n_ u LXXI, 57, 72, 74.\n\n[243:21](sbe1460.htm#fr_1201)-23. Manu IV, 140.\n\n[243:24](sbe1460.htm#fr_1202) Gautama IX, 61.\n\n[243:26](sbe1460.htm#fr_1203) Vasish _th_ a XII, 45.\n\n[243:29](sbe1460.htm#fr_1204) E.g. in the palace of a king, whence the\nattendants may drive him.\n\n[243:30](sbe1460.htm#fr_1205) Vasish _th_ a XIII, 58.\n\n[243:31](sbe1460.htm#fr_1206) Gautama IX, 65.\n\n[244:33](sbe1460.htm#fr_1207) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 32, 21.\n\n[244:36](sbe1460.htm#fr_1208) Vasish _th_ a XI, 1-2. A _Ri_ shi is, according\nto Govinda, a man who knows not only the text of the Mantras, but also their\nsense. But Baudhayana, G _ri_ hya-sutra I, 11, 4, says that a man who knows,\nbesides the _S_ akha and its A\xe1\xb9\x85gas, the Kalpa also, is called _Ri_ shikalpa,\ni.e. one almost a _Ri_ shi. See also \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 5, 3. A learned man\n(vidvas) is probably a student who has finished not only his vow, but learned\nthe Veda, a so-called vidyasnataka, \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 30, 3. Regarding the\narghya or madhuparka, the honey-mixture, see \xc3\x82pastamba II, 4, 8, 7-9.\n\n[244:37](sbe1460.htm#fr_1209) Gautama V, 27-30. I read kriyarambhe varartvi\n_g_ au. The p. 245 meaning is that a bridegroom is to receive the honey-\nmixture when he comes to his father-in-law's house for his wedding, and an\nofficiating priest when he comes to perform a sacrifice.\n\n[245:38](sbe1460.htm#fr_1210) Vish _n_ u LXXI, 60. Govinda adds that the act\nis performed as a salutation.\n\n[245:41](sbe1460.htm#fr_1211) See e _g_. Taittiriya \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka VIII, 2.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Adhyaya 4, Ka _n_ _d_ ika 7](sbe1461.htm)\n\n"
