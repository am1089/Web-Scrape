X.\n\nThe sons of Nahusha. The sons of Yayati: he is cursed by \xc5\x9aukra: wishes his\nsons to exchange their vigour for his infirmities. Puru alone consents. Yayati\nrestores him his youth: divides the earth amongst his sons, under the\nsupremacy of Puru.\n\nYATI, Yayati, Sanyati, \xc3\x81yati, Viyati, and Kriti were the six valiant sons of\nNahusha 1. Yati declined the sovereignty 2, and Yayati therefore succeeded to\nthe throne. He had two wives, Devayani the daughter of Usanas, and \xc5\x9aarmisht\xcc\x81ha\nthe daughter of Vrishaparvan; of whom this genealogical verse is recited:\n"Devayani bore two sons, Yadu and Turvasu. Sarmisht\xcc\x81ha, the daughter of\nVrishaparvan, had three sons, Druhyu, Anu, and Puru 3." Through the curse of\nU\xc5\x9banas, Yayati\n\np. 414\n\nbecame old and infirm before his time; but having appeased his father-in-law,\nhe obtained permission to transfer his decrepitude to any one who would\nconsent to take it. He first applied to his eldest son Yadu, and said, "Your\nmaternal grandfather has brought this premature decay upon me: by his\npermission, however, I may transfer it to you for a thousand years. I am not\nyet satiate, with worldly enjoyments, and wish to partake of them through the\nmeans of your youth. Do not refuse compliance with my request." Yadu, however,\nwas not willing to take upon him his father\'s decay; on which his father\ndenounced an imprecation upon him, and said, "Your posterity shall not possess\ndominion." He then applied successively to Druhyu, Turvasu, and Anu, and\ndemanded of them their juvenile vigour. They all refused, and were in\nconsequence cursed by the king. Lastly he made the same request of\nSarmisht\xcc\x81ha\'s youngest son, Puru, who bowed to his father, and readily\nconsented to give him his youth, and receive in exchange Yayati\'s infirmities,\nsaying that his father had conferred upon him a great favour.\n\nThe king Yayati being thus endowed with renovated youth, conducted the affairs\nof state for the good of his people, enjoying such pleasures as were suited to\nhis age and strength, and were not incompatible with virtue. He formed a\nconnexion with the celestial nymph Vi\xc5\x9bwachi, and was wholly attached to her,\nand conceived no end to his desires. The more they were gratified, the more\nardent they became; as it is said in this verse, "Desire is not appeased by\nenjoyment: fire fed with sacrificial oil becomes but the more intense. No one\nhas ever more than enough of rice, or barley, or gold, or cattle, or women:\nabandon therefore inordinate desire. When a mind finds neither good nor ill in\nall objects, but looks on all with an equal eye, then every thing yields it\npleasure. The wise man is filled with happiness, who escapes from desire,\nwhich the feeble minded can with difficulty relinquish, and which grows not\nold with the aged. The hair becomes grey, the teeth fall out, as man advances\nin years; but the love of wealth, the love of life, are not impaired by age."\n"A thousand years\n\np. 415\n\nhave passed," reflected Yayati, "and my mind is still devoted to pleasure:\nevery day my desires are awakened by new objects. I will therefore now\nrenounce all sensual enjoyment, and fix my mind upon spiritual truth.\nUnaffected by the alternatives of pleasure and pain, and having nothing I may\ncall my own, I will henceforth roam the forests with the deer."\n\nHaving made this determination, Yayati restored his youth to Puru, resumed his\nown decrepitude, installed his youngest son in the sovereignty, and departed\nto the wood of penance (Tapovana 4). To Turvasu he consigned the south-east\ndistricts of his kingdom; the west to Druhyu; the south to Yadu; and the north\nto Anu; to govern as viceroys under their younger brother Puru, whom he\nappointed supreme monarch of the earth 5.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[413:1](vp103.htm#fr_1094) The Bhagavata refers briefly to the story of\nNahusha, which is told in the Mahabharata more than once, in the Vana Parva,\nUdyoga P., Dana Dharma P., and others; also in the Padma and other Puran\xcc\x81as.\nHe had obtained the rank of Indra; but in his pride, or at the suggestion of\n\xc5\x9aachi, compelling the Rishis to bear his litter, he was cursed by them to fall\nfrom his state, and reappear upon earth as a serpent. From this form he was\nset free by philosophical discussions with Yudhisht\xcc\x81hira, and received final\nliberation. Much speculation, wholly unfounded, has been started by Wilford\'s\nconjecture that the name of this prince, with Deva, \'divine,\' prefixed, a\ncombination which never occurs, was the same as Dionysius or Bacchus.\nAuthorities generally agree as to the names of the first three of his sons: in\nthose of the others there is much variety, and the Matsya, Agni, and Padma\nhave seven names, as follows omitting the three first of the text:\n\nMatsya.\n\n|\n\nAgni.\n\n|\n\nPadma.\n\n|\n\nLinga.  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \nUdbhava\n\n|\n\nUdbhava\n\n|\n\nUdbhava\n\n|\n\n\xc5\x9aaryati  \n  \nPan\xc5\x9bchi\n\n|\n\nPanchaka\n\n|\n\nPava\n\n|\n\nChampaka  \n  \nSunyati\n\n|\n\nPalaka\n\n|\n\nViyati\n\n|\n\nAndhaka  \n  \nMeghayati\n\n|\n\nMegha\n\n|\n\nMeghayati\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n[413:2](vp103.htm#fr_1095) Or, as his name implies, he became a devotee, a\nYati: Bhagavata, &c.\n\n[413:3](vp103.htm#fr_1096) The story is told in great detail in the Adi Parvan\nof the Mahabharata, also in the Bhagavata, with some additions evidently of a\nrecent taste. \xc5\x9aarmisht\xcc\x81ha, the daughter of Vrishaparvan, king of the Daityas,\nhaving quarrelled with Devayani, the daughter of \xc5\x9aukra (the religious\npreceptor of the same race), had her thrown into a well. Yayati, hunting in\nthe forest, found her, and taking her to her father, with his consent espoused\nher. Devayani, in resentment of \xc5\x9aarmisht\xcc\x81ha\'s treatment, demanded that she\nshould become her handmaid; and Vrishaparvan, afraid of \xc5\x9aukra\'s displeasure,\nwas compelled to comply. In the service of his queen, however, Yayati beheld\n\xc5\x9aarmisht\xcc\x81ha, and secretly wedded her. Devayani complaining to her father of\nYayati\'s infidelity, \xc5\x9aukra inflicted on him premature decay, with permission\nto transfer it to any one willing to give him youth and strength in exchange,\nas is related in the text. The passage specifying the sons of Yayati is\nprecisely the same in the Mahabharata p. 414 as in our text, and is introduced\nin the same way.\n\n[415:4](vp103.htm#fr_1097) Bhrigutunga, according to the Brahma.\n\n[415:5](vp103.htm#fr_1098) The elder brothers were made Man\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81ala-nripas,\nkings of circles or districts: Bhagavata. The situation of their governments\nis not exactly agreed upon.\n\n\n\n|\n\nVayu and  \nPadma.\n\n|\n\nBrahma  \nand Hari V.\n\n|\n\nBhagavata.  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \nTurvasu\n\n|\n\nSouth-east\n\n|\n\nSouth-east\n\n|\n\nWest  \n  \nDruhyu\n\n|\n\nWest\n\n|\n\nWest\n\n|\n\nSouth-east  \n  \nYadu\n\n|\n\nSouth-west\n\n|\n\nSouth\n\n|\n\nSouth  \n  \nAnu\n\n|\n\nNorth\n\n|\n\nNorth\n\n|\n\nNorth  \n  \n[paragraph continues] The Linga describes the ministers and people as\nexpostulating with Yayati, for illegally giving the supremacy to the youngest\nson; but he satisfies them by shewing that he was justified in setting the\nseniors aside, for want of filial duty. The Mahabharata, Udyoga P. Galava\nCharitra, has a legend of Yayati\'s giving a daughter to the saint Galava, who\nthrough her means obtains from different princes eight hundred horses, white\nwith one black ear, as a fee for his preceptor Viswamitra. Yayati, after his\ndeath and residence in Indra\'s heaven, is again descending to earth, when his\ndaughter\'s sons give him the benefit of their devotions, and replace him in\nthe celestial sphere. It has the air of an old story. A legend in some\nrespects similar has been related in our text, [p. 399](vp099.htm#page_399).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XI](vp104.htm)\n\n'
