His _zamindar_ , it\nappeared, had fined him a hundred rupees, and was threatening him with\nejectment.\n\n"For what fault?" I enquired.\n\n"Because," I was told, "he has been found selling foreign cloths. He begged\nand prayed Harish Kundu, his _zamindar_ , to let him sell off his stock,\nbought with borrowed money, promising faithfully never to do it again; but the\n_zamindar_ would not hear of it, and insisted on his burning the foreign stuff\nthere and then, if he wanted to be let off. Panchu in his desperation blurted\nout defiantly: "I can\'t afford it! You are rich; why not buy it up and burn\nit?" This only made Harish Kundu red in the face as he shouted: "The scoundrel\nmust be taught manners, give him a shoe-beating!" So poor Panchu got insulted\nas well as fined."\n\n"What happened to the cloth?"\n\n"The whole bale was burnt."\n\n"Who else was there?"\n\n"Any number of people, who all kept shouting _Bande Mataram_. Sandip was also\nthere. He took up some of the ashes, crying: \'Brothers! This is the first\nfuneral pyre lighted by your village in celebration of the last rites of\nforeign commerce. These are sacred ashes. Smear yourselves with them in token\nof your _Swadeshi_ vow.\'"\n\n"Panchu," said I, turning to him, "you must lodge a complaint."\n\n"No one will bear me witness," he replied.\n\n"None bear witness?--Sandip! Sandip!"\n\nSandip came out of his room at my call. "What is the matter?" he asked.\n\n"Won\'t you bear witness to the burning of this man\'s cloth?"\n\nSandip smiled. "Of course I shall be a witness in the case," he said. "But I\nshall be on the opposite side."\n\n"What do you mean," I exclaimed, "by being a witness on this or that side?\nWill you not bear witness to the truth?"\n\n"Is the thing which happens the only truth?"\n\n"What other truths can there be?"\n\n"The things that ought to happen! The truth we must build up will require a\ngreat deal of untruth in the process. Those who have made their way in the\nworld have created truth, not blindly followed it."\n\n"And so--"\n\n"And so I will bear what you people are pleased to call false witness, as they\nhave done who have created empires, built up social systems, founded religious\norganizations. Those who would rule do not dread untruths; the shackles of\ntruth are reserved for those who will fall under their sway. Have you not read\nhistory? Do you not know that in the immense cauldrons, where vast political\ndevelopments are simmering, untruths are the main ingredients?"\n\n"Political cookery on a large scale is doubtless going on, but--"\n\n"Oh, I know! You, of course, will never do any of the cooking. You prefer to\nbe one of those down whose throats the hotchpotch which is being cooked will\nbe crammed. They will partition Bengal and say it is for your benefit. They\nwill seal the doors of education and call it raising the standard. But you\nwill always remain good boys, snivelling in your corners. We bad men, however,\nmust see whether we cannot erect a defensive fortification of untruth."\n\n"It is no use arguing about these things, Nikhil," my master interposed. "How\ncan they who do not feel the truth within them, realize that to bring it out\nfrom its obscurity into the light is man\'s highest aim--not to keep on heaping\nmaterial outside?"\n\nSandip laughed. "Right, sir!" said he. "Quite a correct speech for a\nschoolmaster. That is the kind of stuff I have read in books; but in the real\nworld I have seen that man\'s chief business is the accumulation of outside\nmaterial. Those who are masters in the art, advertise the biggest lies in\ntheir business, enter false accounts in their political ledgers with their\nbroadest-pointed pens, launch their newspapers daily laden with untruths, and\nsend preachers abroad to disseminate falsehood like flies carrying\npestilential germs. I am a humble follower of these great ones. When I was\nattached to the Congress party I never hesitated to dilute ten per cent of\ntruth with ninety per cent of untruth. And now, merely because I have ceased\nto belong to that party, I have not forgotten the basic fact that man\'s goal\nis not truth but success."\n\n"True success," corrected my master.\n\n"Maybe," replied Sandip, "but the fruit of true success ripens only by\ncultivating the field of untruth, after tearing up the soil and pounding it\ninto dust. Truth grows up by itself like weeds and thorns, and only worms can\nexpect to get fruit from it!" With this he flung out of the room.\n\nMy master smiled as he looked towards me. "Do you know, Nikhil," he said, "I\nbelieve Sandip is not irreligious--his religion is of the obverse side of\ntruth, like the dark moon, which is still a moon, for all that its light has\ngone over to the wrong side."\n\n"That is why," I assented, "I have always had an affection for him, though we\nhave never been able to agree. I cannot contemn him, even now; though he has\nhurt me sorely, and may yet hurt me more."\n\n"I have begun to realize that," said my master. "I have long wondered how you\ncould go on putting up with him. I have, at times, even suspected you of\nweakness. I now see that though you two do not rhyme, your rhythm is the\nsame."\n\n"Fate seems bent on writing _Paradise Lost_ in blank verse, in my case, and so\nhas no use for a rhyming friend!" I remarked, pursuing his conceit.\n\n"But what of Panchu?" resumed my master.\n\n"You say Harish Kundu wants to eject him from his ancestral holding. Supposing\nI buy it up and then keep him on as my tenant?"\n\n"And his fine?"\n\n"How can the _zamindar_ realize that if he becomes my tenant?"\n\n"His burnt bale of cloth?"\n\n"I will procure him another. I should like to see anyone interfering with a\ntenant of mine, for trading as he pleases!"\n\n"I am afraid, sir," interposed Panchu despondently, "while you big folk are\ndoing the fighting, the police and the law vultures will merrily gather round,\nand the crowd will enjoy the fun, but when it comes to getting killed, it will\nbe the turn of only poor me!"\n\n"Why, what harm can come to you?"\n\n"They will burn down my house, sir, children and all!"\n\n"Very well, I will take charge of your children," said my master. "You may go\non with any trade you like. They shan\'t touch you."\n\nThat very day I bought up Panchu\'s holding and entered into formal possession.\nThen the trouble began.\n\nPanchu had inherited the holding of his grandfather as his sole surviving\nheir. Everybody knew this. But at this juncture an aunt turned up from\nsomewhere, with her boxes and bundles, her rosary, and a widowed niece. She\nensconced herself in Panchu\'s home and laid claim to a life interest in all he\nhad.\n\nPanchu was dumbfounded. "My aunt died long ago," he protested.\n\nIn reply he was told that he was thinking of his uncle\'s first wife, but that\nthe former had lost no time in taking to himself a second.\n\n"But my uncle died before my aunt," exclaimed Panchu, still more mystified.\n"Where was the time for him to marry again?"\n\nThis was not denied. But Panchu was reminded that it had never been asserted\nthat the second wife had come after the death of the first, but the former had\nbeen married by his uncle during the latter\'s lifetime. Not relishing the idea\nof living with a co-wife she had remained in her father\'s house till her\nhusband\'s death, after which she had got religion and retired to holy\nBrindaban, whence she was now coming. These facts were well known to the\nofficers of Harish Kundu, as well as to some of his tenants. And if the\n_zamindar\'s_ summons should be peremptory enough, even some of those who had\npartaken of the marriage feast would be forthcoming!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX](hw27.htm)\n\n'
