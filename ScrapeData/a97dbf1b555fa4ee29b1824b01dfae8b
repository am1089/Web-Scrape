Beyond (Brahman, there is something) further, on account of the\ndesignations of bank, measure, connexion, separation.\n\nWith reference to this Brahman which we have ascertained to be free from all\nplurality there now arises the doubt--due to the conflicting nature of various\nscriptural statements--whether something exists beyond it or not. We therefore\nenter on the task of explaining the true meaning of those scriptural passages\nwhich seem to indicate that there is some entity beyond, i.e. apart from\nBrahman.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains that some entity must be admitted apart from\nBrahman, because Brahman is spoken of as being a bank; as having size; as\nbeing connected; as being separated.--As a bank it is spoken of in the\npassage, _Kh_. Up. VIII, 4, 1, 'That Self is a bank, a boundary.' The word\n'bank' (setu) ordinarily denotes a structure of earth, wood and the like,\nserving the purpose of checking the flow of water. Here, being applied to the\nSelf, it intimates that there exists something apart from the Self, just as\nthere exists something different from an ordinary bank. The same conclusion is\nconfirmed by the words, 'Having passed the bank' (VIII, 4, 2). For as in\nordinary life a man after having crossed a bank reaches some place which is\nnot a bank, let us say a forest; so, we must understand, a man after having\ncrossed, i.e. passed beyond the Self reaches something which is not the Self.\n--As having size Brahman is spoken of in the following passages, 'This Brahman\nhas four feet (quarters), eight hoofs, sixteen parts.' Now it is well known\nfrom ordinary experience that wherever an object, a coin, e.g. has a definite\nlimited size, there exists something different from that object; we therefore\nmust assume that there also\n\np. 176\n\nexists something different from Brahman.--Brahman is declared to be connected\nin the following passages, 'Then he is united with the True' ( _Kh_. Up. VI,\n8, 1), and 'The embodied Self is embraced by the highest Self (B _ri_. Up. IV,\n3, 21). Now we observe that non-measured things are connected with things\nmeasured, men, e.g. with a town. And scripture declares that the individual\nsouls are, in the state of deep sleep, connected with Brahman. Hence we\nconclude that beyond Brahman there is something unmeasured.--The same\nconclusion is finally confirmed by those texts which proclaim difference, so\ne.g. the passage, I, 6, 6 ff. ('Now that golden person who is seen within the\nsun' &c.), which at first refers to a Lord residing in the sun and then\nmentions a Lord residing in the eye, distinct from the former ('Now the person\nwho is seen within the eye'). The text distinctly transfers to the latter the\nform &c. of the former [1](sbe38135.htm#fn_122) ('The form of that person is\nthe same as the form of the other' &c.), and moreover declares that the lordly\npower of both is limited, 'He obtains through the one the worlds beyond that\nand the wishes of the devas' &c.; which is very much as if one should say,\n'This is the reign of the king of Magadha and that the reign of the king of\nVideha.'\n\nFrom all this it follows that there exists something different from Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 32](sbe38135.htm)\n\n"
