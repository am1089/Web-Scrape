Origin of Ganga, and separation, on the\ntop of Meru, into four great rivers.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Having thus described to you the system of the world in general, I\nwill now explain to you the dimensions and situations of the sun and other\nluminaries.\n\nThe chariot of the sun is nine thousand leagues in length, and the pole is of\ntwice that longitude 1; the axle is fifteen millions and seven hundred\nthousand leagues long 2; on which is fixed a wheel with three naves, five\nspokes, and six peripheries, consisting of the ever-during year; the whole\nconstituting the circle or wheel of time 3. The chariot has another axle,\nwhich is forty-five thousand five hundred leagues long 4.\n\np. 218\n\n[paragraph continues] The two halves of the yoke are of the same length\nrespectively as the two axles (the longer and the shorter). The short axle,\nwith the short yoke, are supported by the pole-star: the end of the longer\naxle, to which the wheel of the car is attached, moves on the Manasa mountain\n5. The seven horses of the sun\'s car are the metres of the Vedas, Gayatri,\nVrihati, Ushn\xcc\x81ih, Jayati, Trisht\xcc\x81ubh, Anusht\xcc\x81ubh, and Pankti.\n\nThe city of Indra is situated on the eastern side of the Manasottara mountain;\nthat of Yama on the southern face; that of Varun\xcc\x81a on the west; and that of\nSoma on the north: named severally Vaswokasara, Samyamani, Mukhya, and\nVibhavari 6.\n\nThe glorious sun, Maitreya, darts like an arrow on his southern course,\nattended by the constellations of the Zodiac. He causes the difference between\nday and night, and is the divine vehicle and path of the sages who have\novercome the inflictions of the world. Whilst the sun, who is the\ndiscriminator of all hours, shines in one continent in midday, in the opposite\nDwipas, Maitreya, it will be midnight: rising and setting are at all seasons,\nand are always (relatively) opposed in the different cardinal and intermediate\npoints of the horizon. When the sun becomes visible to any people, to them he\nis said to rise; when he disappears from their\n\np. 219\n\nview, that is called his setting. There is in truth neither rising nor setting\nof the sun, for he is always; and these terms merely imply his presence and\nhis disappearance.\n\nWhen the sun (at midday) passes over either of the cities of the gods, on the\nManasottara mountain (at the cardinal points), his light extends to three\ncities and two intermediate points: when situated in an intermediate point, he\nilluminates two of the cities and three intermediate. points (in either case\none hemisphere). From the period of his rise the sun moves with increasing\nrays until noon, when he proceeds towards his setting with rays diminishing\n(that is, his heat increases or diminishes in proportion as he advances to, or\nrecedes from, the meridian of any place). The east and west quarters are so\ncalled from the sun\'s rising and setting there 7. As far as the sun shines in\nfront, so far he shines behind and on either hand, illuminating all places\nexcept the summit of Meru, the mountain of the immortals; for when his rays\nreach the court of Brahma, which is there situated, they are repelled and\ndriven back by the overpowering radiance which there prevails: consequently\nthere is always the alternation of day and night, according as the divisions\nof the continent lie in the northern (or southern) quarter, or inasmuch as\nthey are situated north (or south) of Meru 8.\n\np. 220\n\nThe radiance of the solar orb, when the sun has set, is accumulated in fire,\nand hence fire is visible at a greater distance by night than by day: during\nthe latter a fourth of the rays of fire blend with those of the sun, and from\ntheir union the sun shines with greater intensity by day. Elemental light, and\nheat derived from the sun or from fire, blending with each other, mutually\nprevail in various proportions, both by day and night. When the sun is present\neither in the southern or the northern hemisphere, day or night retires into\nthe waters, according as they are invaded by darkness or light: it is from\nthis cause that the waters look dark by day, because night is within them; and\nthey look white by night, because at the setting of the sun the light of day\ntakes refuge in their bosom 9.\n\nWhen the sun has travelled in the centre of Pushkara a thirtieth part of the\ncircumference of the globe, his course is equal in time to one Muhurtta 10;\nand whirling round like the circumference of the wheel of a potter, he\ndistributes day and night upon the earth. In the commencement of his northern\ncourse, the sun passes to Capricornus, thence to Aquarius, thence to Pisces,\ngoing successively from one sign of the Zodiac to another. After he has passed\nthrough these, the sun attains his equinoctial movement (the vernal equinox),\nwhen he makes the day and night of equal duration. Thenceforward the length of\nthe night decreases, and the day becomes longer, until the sun reaches the end\nof Gemini, when he pursues a different direction, and, entering Cancer, begins\nhis declension to the south. As the circumference of a potter\'s\n\np. 221\n\nwheel revolves most rapidly, so the sun travels rapidly on his southern\njourney: he flies along his path with the velocity of wind, and traverses a\ngreat distance in a short time. In twelve Muhurttas he passes through thirteen\nlunar asterisms and a half during the day; and during the night he passes\nthrough the same distance, only in eighteen Muhurttas. As the centre of the\npotter\'s wheel revolves more slowly than the circumference, so the sun in his\nnorthern path again revolves with less rapidity, and moves over a less space\nof the earth in a longer time, until, at the end of his northern route, the\nday is again eighteen Muhurttas, and the night twelve; the sun passing through\nhalf the lunar mansions by day and by night in those periods respectively. As\nthe lump of clay on the centre of the potter\'s wheel moves most slowly, so the\npolar-star, which is in the centre of the zodiacal wheel, revolves very\ntardily, and ever remains in the centre, as the clay continues in the centre\nof the wheel of the potter.\n\nThe relative length of the day or night depends upon the greater or less\nvelocity with which the sun revolves through the degrees between the two\npoints of the horizon. In the solstitial period, in which his diurnal path is\nquickest, his nocturnal is slowest; and in that in which he moves quick by\nnight, he travels slowly by day. The extent of his journey is in either case\nthe same; for in the course of the day and night he passes through all the\nsigns of the Zodiac, or six by night, and the same number by day: the length\nand shortness of the day are measured by the extent of the signs; and the\nduration of day and night by the period which the sun takes to pass through\nthem 11. In his northern\n\np. 222\n\ndeclination the sun moves quickest by night, and slowest by day; in his\nsouthern declination the reverse is the case.\n\nThe night is called Usha, and the day is denominated Vyusht\xcc\x81a, and the\ninterval between them is called Sandhya. On the occurrence of the awful\nSandhya, the terrific fiends termed Mandehas attempt to devour the sun; for\nBrahma denounced this curse upon them, that, without the power to perish, they\nshould die every day (and revive by night), and therefore a fierce contest\noccurs daily between them and the sun 12. At this season pious Brahmans\nscatter water, purified by the mystical Omkara, and consecrated by the Gayatri\n13; and by this water, as by a thunderbolt, the foul fiends are consumed. When\nthe first oblation is offered with solemn invocations in the morning rite 14,\nthe thousand-rayed deity shines forth with unclouded splendour. Omkara is\nVishn\xcc\x81u the mighty, the substance of the three Vedas, the lord of speech; and\nby its enunciation those Rakshasas are destroyed. The sun is a principal part\nof Vishn\xcc\x81u, and light is his immutable essence, the active manifestation of\nwhich is excited by the mystic syllable Om. Light effused by the utterance of\nOmkara becomes radiant, and burns up entirely the Rakshasas called Mandehas.\nThe performance of the Sandhya (the morning) sacrifice must never therefore be\ndelayed, for he who neglects it is guilty of the murder of the sun. Protected\nthus by the Brahmans and the pigmy sages called Balakhilyas, the sun goes on\nhis course to give light to the world.\n\np. 223\n\nFifteen twinklings of the eye (Nimeshas) make a Kasht\xcc\x81ha; thirty Kasht\xcc\x81has, a\nKala; thirty Kalas, a Muhurtta (forty-eight minutes); and thirty Muhurttas, a\nday and night: the portions of the day are longer or shorter, as has been\nexplained; but the Sandhya is always the same in increase or decrease, being\nonly one Muhurtta 15. From the period that a line may be drawn across the sun\n(or that half his orb is visible) to the expiration of three Muhurttas (two\nhours and twenty-four minutes), that interval is called Pratar (morning),\nforming a fifth portion of the day. The next portion, or three Muhurttas from\nmorning, is termed Sangava (forenoon): the three next Muhurttas constitute\nmid-day: the afternoon comprises the next three Muhurttas: the three Muhurttas\nfollowing are considered as the evening: and the fifteen Muhurttas of the day\nare thus classed in five portions of three each. But the day consists of\nfifteen Muhurttas only at the equinoxes, increasing or diminishing in number\nin the northern and southern declinations of the sun, when the day encroaches\non the night, or the night upon the day. The equinoxes occur in the seasons of\nspring and autumn, when the sun enters the signs of Aries and Libra. When the\nsun enters Capricorn (the winter solstice), his northern progress commences;\nand his southern when he enters Cancer (the summer solstice).\n\nFifteen days of thirty Muhurttas each are called a Paksha (a lunar fortnight);\ntwo of these make a month; and two months, a solar season; three seasons a\nnorthern or southern declination (Ayana); and those two compose a year. Years,\nmade up of four kinds of months 16, are distinguished\n\np. 224\n\ninto five kinds; and an aggregate of all the varieties of time is termed a\nYoga, or cycle. The years are severally called Samvatsara, Parivatsara,\nIdvatsara, Anuvatsara, and Vatsara. This is the time called a Yuga 17.\n\nThe mountain range that lies most to the north (in Bharata-varsha) is called\n\xc5\x9aringavan (the horned), from its having three principal elevations (horns or\npeaks), one to the north, one to the south, and one in the centre; the last is\ncalled the equinoctial, for the sun arrives there in the middle of the two\nseasons of spring and autumn, entering the equinoctial points in the first\ndegree of Aries and of Libra, and making day and night of equal duration, or\nfifteen Muhurttas each. When the sun, most excellent sage, is in the first\ndegree of the lunar mansion, Krittika, and the moon is in the. fourth of\nVi\xc5\x9bakha, or when the sun is in the third\n\np. 225\n\ndegree of Vi\xc5\x9bakha, and the moon is in the head of Krittika (these positions\nbeing cotemporary with the equinoxes), that equinoctial season is holy (and is\nstyled the Mahavishubha, or the great equinox) 18. At this time offerings are\nto be presented to the gods and to the manes, and gifts are to be made to the\nBrahmans by serious persons; for such donations are productive of happiness.\nLiberality at the equinoxes is always advantageous to the donor: and day and\nnight; seconds, minutes, and hours; intercalary months; the day of full moon\n(Paurnamasi); the day of conjunction (Amavasya), when the moon rises\ninvisible; the day when it is first seen (\xc5\x9ainivali); the day when it first\ndisappears (Kuhu); the day when the moon is quite round (Raka); and the day\nwhen one digit is deficient (Anumati), are all seasons when gifts are\nmeritorious.\n\nThe sun is in his northern declination in the months Tapas, Tapasya, Madhu,\nMadhava, \xc5\x9aukra, and \xc5\x9auchi; and in his southern in those of Nabhas, Nabhasya,\nIsha, \xc3\x9arja, Sahas, Sahasya 19.\n\nOn the Lokaloka mountain, which I have formerly described to you,\n\np. 226\n\nreside the four holy protectors of the world; or Sudhaman and Sankhapad, the\ntwo sons of Kardama, and Hiran\xcc\x81yaroman, and Ketumat 20. Unaffected by the\ncontrasts of existence, void of selfishness, active, and unencumbered by\ndependants, they take charge of the spheres, themselves abiding on the four\ncardinal points of the Lokaloka mountain.\n\nOn the north of Agastya, and south of the line of the Goat, exterior to the\nVaiswanara path, lies the road of the Pitris 21. There dwell the great\n\np. 227\n\n[paragraph continues] Rishis, the offerers of oblations with fire, reverencing\nthe Vedas, after whose injunctions creation commenced, and who were\ndischarging the duties of ministrant priests: for as the worlds are destroyed\nand renewed, they institute new rules of conduct, and reestablish the\ninterrupted ritual of the Vedas. Mutually descending from each other,\nprogenitor springing from descendant, and descendant from progenitor, in the\nalternating succession of births, they repeatedly appear in different housed\nand races along with their posterity, devout practices and instituted\nobservances, residing to the south of the solar orb, as long as the moon and\nstars endure 22.\n\nThe path of the gods lies to the north of the solar sphere, north of the\nNagavithi 23, and south of the seven Rishis. There dwell the Siddhas, of\nsubdued senses, continent and pure, undesirous of progeny, and therefore\nvictorious over death: eighty-eight thousand of these chaste beings tenant the\nregions of the sky, north of the sun, until the destruction of the universe:\nthey enjoy immortality, for that they are holy; exempt from covetousness and\nconcupiscence, love and hatred; taking no part in the procreation of living\nbeings, and detecting the unreality of the properties of elementary matter. By\nimmortality is meant existence to the end of the Kalpa: life as long as the\nthree regions (earth, sky, and heaven) last is called exemption from\n(reiterated) death 24. The consequences of acts of iniquity or piety, such as\nBrahmanicide or an A\xc5\x9bwamedha, endure for a similar period, or until the end of\na Kalpa 25, when all within the interval between Dhruva and the earth is\ndestroyed.\n\np. 228\n\nThe space between the seven Rishis and Dhruva 26, the third region of the sky,\nis the splendid celestial path of Vishn\xcc\x81u (Vishn\xcc\x81upada), and the abode of\nthose sanctified ascetics who are cleansed from every soil, and in whom virtue\nand vice are annihilated. This is that excellent place of Vishn\xcc\x81u to which\nthose repair in whom all sources of pain are extinct, in consequence of the\ncessation of the consequences of piety or iniquity, and where they never\nsorrow more. There abide Dharma, Dhruva, and other spectators of the world,\nradiant with the superhuman faculties of Vishn\xcc\x81u, acquired through religious\nmeditation; and there are fastened and inwoven to all that is, and all that\nshall ever be, animate or inanimate. The seat of Vishn\xcc\x81u is contemplated by\nthe wisdom of the Yogis, identified with supreme light, as the radiant eye of\nheaven. In this portion of the heavens the splendid Dhruva is stationed, and\nserves for the pivot of the atmosphere. On Dhruva rest the seven great\nplanets, and on them depend the clouds. The rains are suspended in the clouds,\nand from the rains come the water which is the nutriment and delight of all,\nthe gods and the rest; and they, the gods, who are the receivers of oblations,\nbeing nourished by burnt-offerings, cause the rain to fall for the support of\ncreated beings. This sacred station of Vishn\xcc\x81u, therefore, is the support of\nthe three worlds, as it is the source of rain.\n\nFrom that third region of the atmosphere, or seat of Vishn\xcc\x81u, proceeds the\nstream that washes away all sin, the river Ganga, embrowned with the unguents\nof the nymphs of heaven, who have sported in her waters. Having her source in\nthe nail of the great toe of Vishn\xcc\x81u\'s left foot, Dhruva 27 receives her, and\nsustains her day and night devoutly on his head; and thence the seven Rishis\npractise the exercises of austerity in her waters, wreathing their braided\nlocks with her waves. The orb of the moon, encompassed by her accumulated\ncurrent, derives augmented lustre from her contact. Falling from on high, as\nshe issues from the moon; she alights on the summit of Meru, and thence flows\nto the four\n\np. 229\n\nquarters of the earth, for its purification. The \xc5\x9aita, Alakananda, Chakshu,\nand Bhadra are four branches of but one river, divided according to the\nregions towards which it proceeds. The branch that is known as the Alakananda\nwas borne affectionately by Mahadeva, upon his head, for more than a hundred\nyears, and was the river which raised to heaven the sinful sons of Sagara, by\nwashing their ashes 28. The offences of any man who bathes in this river are\nimmediately expiated, and unprecedented virtue is engendered. Its waters,\noffered by sons to their ancestors in faith for three years, yield to the\nlatter rarely attainable gratification. Men of the twice-born orders, who\noffer sacrifice in this river to the lord of sacrifice, Purushottama, obtain\nwhatever they desire, either here or in heaven. Saints who are purified from\nall soil by bathing in its waters, and whose minds are intent on Ke\xc5\x9bava,\nacquire thereby final liberation. This sacred stream, heard of, desired, seen,\ntouched, bathed in, or hymned, day by day, sanctifies all beings; and those\nwho, even at a distance of a hundred leagues, exclaim "Ganga, Ganga," atone\nfor the sins committed during three previous lives. The place whence this\nriver proceeds, for the purification of the three worlds, is the third\ndivision of the celestial regions, the seat of Vishn\xcc\x81u 29.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[217:1](vp066.htm#fr_680) The sun\'s car is 10.000 Yojanas broad, and as many\ndeep, according to the Vayu and Matsya. The Bhagavata makes it thirty-six\nhundred thousand long, and one fourth that broad. The Linga agrees with the\ntext.\n\n[217:2](vp066.htm#fr_681) There is no great difference in this number in other\naccounts. The length of this axle, which extends from Meru to Manasa, is\nnearly equal to the semidiameter of the earth, which, according to the Matsya\nP., is 18.950.000 Yojanas.\n\n[217:3](vp066.htm#fr_682) The three naves are the three divisions of the day,\nmorning, noon, and night; the five spokes are the five cyclic years; and the\nsix peripheries are the six seasons. The Bhagavata explains the three naves to\nbe three periods of the year, of four months each, and gives twelves spokes as\ntypes of the twelve months. The Vayu, Matsya, and Bhavishya Puran\xcc\x81as enter\ninto much more detail. According to them, the parts of the wheel are the same\nas above described: the body of the car is the year; its upper and lower half\nare the two solstices; Dharma is its flag; Artha and Kama the pins of the yoke\nand axle; night is its fender; Nimeshas form its floor; a moment is the axle-\ntree; an instant the pole; minutes are its attendants; and hours its harness.\n\n[217:4](vp066.htm#fr_683) This shorter axle is, according to the Bhagavata,\none fourth of the longer.\n\n[218:5](vp066.htm#fr_684) We are to understand here, both in the axle and\nyoke, two levers, one horizontal, the other perpendicular. The horizontal arm\nof the axle has a wheel at one end; the other extremity is connected with the\nperpendicular arm. To the horizontal arm of the yoke are harnessed the horses;\nand its inner or right extremity is secured to the perpendicular. The upper\nends of both perpendiculars are supposed to be attached to Dhruva, the pole-\nstar, by two aerial cords, which are lengthened in the sun\'s southern course,\nand shortened in his northern; and retained by which to Dhruva, as to a pivot,\nthe wheel of the car traverses the summit of the Manasottara mountain on\nPushkara-dwipa, which runs like a ring round the several continents and\noceans. The contrivance is commonly compared to an oil mill, and was probably\nsuggested by that machine as constructed in India. As the Manasottara mountain\nis but 50.000 leagues high, and Meru 84.000, whilst Dhruva is 1500.000, both\nlevers are inclined at obtuse angles to the nave of the wheel and each other.\nIn images of the sun, two equal and semicircular axles connect a central wheel\nwith the sides of the car.\n\n[218:6](vp066.htm#fr_685) In the Linga the city of Indra is called Amaravati;\nand in it and the Vayu that of Varun\xcc\x81a is termed Sukha.\n\n[219:7](vp066.htm#fr_686) The terms Purva and Apara mean properly \'before and\nbehind;\' but \'before\' naturally denotes the east, either because men,\naccording to a text of the Vedas, spontaneously face, as if to welcome the\nrising sun, or because they are enjoined by the laws so to do. When they face\nthe rising sun, the west is of course behind them. The same circumstance\ndetermines the application of the term Dakshina, properly \'right,\' \xce\xb4\xce\xb5\xce\xbe\xce\xb9\xe1\xbd\xb8\xcf\x82, or\n\'dexterum,\' to the south. Uttara, \'other\' or \'last,\' necessarily implies the\nnorth.\n\n[219:8](vp066.htm#fr_687) This is rather obscure, but it is made out clearly\nenough in the commentary, and in the parallel passages in the Vayu, Matsya,\nLinga, Kurma, and Bhagavata. The sun travels round the world, keeping Meru\nalways on his right: to the spectator who fronts him therefore, as he rises,\nMeru must be always on the north; and as the sun\'s rays do not penetrate\nbeyond the centre of the mountain, the regions beyond, or to the north of it,\nmust be in darkness; whilst those on the south of it must be in light: north\nand south being relative, not absolute terms, depending upon the position of\nthe spectator with regard to the sun and to Meru. So the commentator: ###. p.\n220 It was probably through some misapprehension of this doctrine that Major\nWilford asserted, "by Meru the Pauran\xcc\x81iks understand in general the north\npole, but the context of the Puran\xcc\x81as is against this supposition." As. Res.\nVIII. 286. There is no inconsistency, however, in Meru\'s being absolutely in\nthe centre of the world, and relatively north to the inhabitants of the\nseveral portions, to all of whom the east is that quarter where the sun first\nappears, and the other quarters are thereby regulated.\n\n[220:9](vp066.htm#fr_688) Similar notions are contained in the Vayu.\n\n[220:10](vp066.htm#fr_689) The sun travels at the rate of one-thirtieth of the\nearth\'s circumference in a Muhurtta, or 31.50.000 Yojanas; making the total 9\ncrores and 45 lakhs, or 9.45.00.000; according to the Vayu, Lingo, and Matsya\nPuran\xcc\x81as.\n\n[221:11](vp066.htm#fr_690) This passage, which is somewhat at variance with\nthe general doctrine, that the length of the day depends upon the velocity of\nthe sun\'s course, and which has not been noticed in any other Pauran\xcc\x81ik text,\nis defended by the commentator, upon the authority of the Jyotish\xc5\x9bastra, or\nastronomical writings. According to them, he asserts, the signs of the Zodiac\nare of different extent. Aquarius, Pisces, and Aries are the shortest; Taurus,\nCapricornus, and Gemini are something longer; Leo and Scorpio longer still;\nand the remaining four the longest of all. According to the six which the sun\ntraverses, the day or night will be the longer or shorter. The text is, ###.\nThe apparent contradiction may however be reconciled by understanding the\nsun\'s slow motion, and the length of a sign, to be equivalent terms.\n\n[222:12](vp066.htm#fr_691) The same story occurs in the Vayu, with the\naddition that the Mandehas are three crores in number. It seems to be an\nancient legend, imperfectly preserved in some of the Puran\xcc\x81as.\n\n[222:13](vp066.htm#fr_692) The sacred syllable Om has been already described\n(p. [1](vp035.htm#page_1). n. [1](vp035.htm#fn_98)). The Gayatri, or holiest\nverse of the Vedas, not to be uttered to ears profane, is a short prayer to\nthe sun, identified as the supreme, and occurs in the tenth hymn of the fourth\nsection of the third Asht\xcc\x81aka of the Sanhita of the Rig-veda: \'We meditate on\nthat excellent light of the divine sun: may he illuminate our minds.\' Such is\nthe fear entertained of profaning this text, that copyists of the Vedas not\nunfrequently refrain from transcribing it, both in the Sanhita and Bhashya.\n\n[222:14](vp066.htm#fr_693) Or, in the text, with the prayer that commences\nwith the words Surya jyotir, \'That which is in the sun (or light) is\nadorable,\' &c. The whole prayer is given in Colebrooke\'s account of the\nreligious ceremonies of the Hindus. As. Res. V. 355.\n\n[223:15](vp066.htm#fr_694) But this comprehends the two Sandhyas, \'morning and\nevening twilight.\' Two Naris, or half a Muhurtta before sunrise, constitute\nthe morning Sandhya; and the same interval after sunset the evening. Sandhya,\nmeaning \'junction,\' is so termed as it is the juncture or interval between\ndarkness and light; as in the Vayu and Matsya: ###.\n\n[223:16](vp066.htm#fr_695) The four months are named in the Vayu, and are, 1.\nthe Saura, or solar-sydereal, consisting of the sun\'s passage through a sign\nof the Zodiac: 2. the Saumya or Chandra or lunar month, comprehending thirty\nlunations or Tithis, and reckoned most usually from new moon to new moon,\nthough sometimes from full moon to full moon: 3. the Savana or solar month,\ncontaining thirty days of sunrise and sunset: and 4. the Nakshatra or lunar p.\n224 asterismal month, which is the moon\'s revolution through the twenty-eight\nlunar mansions.\n\n[224:17](vp066.htm#fr_696) The five years forming this Yuga, or cycle, differ\nonly in denomination, being composed of the months above described, with such\nMalamasas, or intercalary months, as may be necessary to complete the period,\naccording to Vriddha Garga. The cycle comprehends, therefore, sixty solar-\nsydereal months of 1800 days; sixty-one solar months, or 1830 days; sixty-two\nlunar months, or 1860 lunations; and sixty-seven lunar-asterismal months, or\n1809 such days. Col. Warren, in his Kala Sankalita, considers these years to\nbe severally cycles. "In the cycle of sixty," he observes, "are contained five\ncycles of twelve years, each supposed equal to one year of the planet\n(Jupiter). I only mention this cycle because I found it mentioned in some\nbooks; but I know of no nation nor tribe that reckons time after that account.\nThe names of the five cycles, or Yugs, are, 1. Samvatsara, 2. Parivatsara, 3.\nIdvatsara, 4. Anuvatsara, 5. Udravatsara. The name of each year is determined\nfrom the Nakshatra, in which Vrihaspati sets and rises heliacally, and they\nfollow in the order of the lunar months." K. S. 212. It may be reasonably\ndoubted, however, if this view be correct; and the only connexion between the\ncycle of five years and that of Vrihaspati may be the multiplication of the\nformer by the latter (5 x 12), so as to form the cycle of sixty years: a cycle\nbased, the commentator remarks, upon the conjunction (Yuga) of the sun and\nmoon in every sixtieth year. The original and properly Indian cycle, however,\nis that of five years, as Bentley remarks. "The astronomers of this period\n(1181 B. C.) framed a cycle of five years for civil and religious ceremonies."\nAncient and modern Hindu Astronomy. It is in fact, as Mr. Colebrooke states,\nthe cycle of the Vedas, described in the Jyotish, or astronomical sections,\nand specified in the institutes of Para\xc5\x9bara as the basis of calculation for\nlarger cycles. As. Res. VIII. 470.\n\n[225:18](vp066.htm#fr_697) Reference is here made apparently, though\nindistinctly, to those positions of the planets which indicate, according to\nBentley, the formation of the lunar mansions by Hindu astronomers, about 1424\nB. C. Hindu Astronomy, p. 3 and 4. The Vayu and Linga Puran\xcc\x81as specify the\npositions of the other planets at the same time, or the end, according to the\nformer, of the Chakshusha Manwantara. At that time the sun was in Vi\xc5\x9bakha, the\nmoon in Krittika, Venus in Pushya, Jupiter in Purvaphalguni, Mars in \xc3\x81shad\xcc\x81ha,\nBudha in Dhanisht\xcc\x81ha, \xc5\x9aani in Revati, Ketu in \xc3\x81slesha, and Rahu in Bharani.\nThere are differences between some of these and the positions cited by\nBentley, but most of them are the same. He considers them to have been\nobservations of the occultations of the moon by the planets, in the respective\nlunar mansions, 1424-5 B. C. According to the Vayu, these positions or origins\nof the planets are from the Vedas: ###. The Linga, less accurately perhaps,\nreads ### referring it to the works of law.\n\n[225:19](vp066.htm#fr_698) These are the names of the months which occur in\nthe Vedas, and belong to a system now obsolete, as was noticed by Sir Wm.\nJones. As. Res. III. 258. According to the classification of the text, they\ncorrespond severally with the lunar months Magha, Phalguna, Chaitra, Vai\xc5\x9bakha,\nJyesht\xcc\x81ha, \xc3\x81sharha, or from December to June; and with \xc5\x9aravan\xcc\x81a, Bhadra,\n\xc3\x81swina, Kartika, Agrahayana, and Pausha, from July to December. From this\norder of the two series of the months, as occurring in the Vedas, Mr.\nColebrooke infers, upon astronomical computations, their date to be about\nfourteen centuries prior to the Christian era. As. Res. VII. 283.\n\n[226:20](vp066.htm#fr_699) The Vayu has the same names, but ascribes a\ndifferent descent to the first, making Sudhaman the son of Viraja. Sankhapad\nis the son of Kardama: the other two are the sons of Parjanya and Rajas,\nconsistently with the origin ascribed to these Lokapalas in the patriarchal\ngenealogies of that Puran\xcc\x81a (see [p. 83](vp045.htm#page_83)).\n\n[226:21](vp066.htm#fr_700) Allusion is here made to some divisions of the\ncelestial sphere which are not described in any other part of the text. The\nfullest, but still in some respects a confused and partly inaccurate account\nis given in the Matsya Puran\xcc\x81a; but a more satisfactory description occurs in\nthe comment on the Bhagavata, there cited from the Vayu, but not found in the\ncopies consulted on the present occasion. According to those details, the path\n(Marga) of the sun and other planets amongst the lunar asterisms is divided\ninto three portions or Avasht\xcc\x81hanas, northern, southern, and central, called\nseverally Airavata, Jaradgava (Ajagava, Matsya P.), and Vaiswanara. Each of\nthese, again, is divided into three parts or Vithis: those of the northern\nportion are termed Nagavithi, Gajavithi, and Airavati; those of the centre are\n\xc3\x81rshabhi Govithi, and Jaradgavi; and those of the south are named Ajavithi,\nMrigavithi, and Vaiswanari. Each of these Vithis comprises three asterisms.\n\nNagavithi\n\n|\n\nAswini  \nBharan\xcc\x81i  \nKrittika  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nGajavithi\n\n|\n\nRohini  \nMriga\xc5\x9biras  \nArdra  \n  \nAiravati\n\n|\n\nPunarvasu  \nPushya  \n\xc3\x81slesha  \n  \n\xc3\x81rshabhi\n\n|\n\nMagha  \nPurvaphalguni  \nUttaraphalguni  \n  \nGovithi\n\n|\n\nHasta  \nChitra  \nSwati  \n  \nJaradgavi\n\n|\n\nVi\xc5\x9bakha  \nAnuradha  \nJyesht\xcc\x81ha  \n  \nAjavithi\n\n|\n\nMula  \nPurvashad\xcc\x81ha  \nUttarashad\xcc\x81ha  \n  \nMrigavithi\n\n|\n\n[\xc5\x9aravan\xcc\x81a](errata.htm#8)  \nDhanisht\xcc\x81ha  \nSatabhisha  \n  \nVaiswanari\n\n|\n\nPurva Bhadrapada  \nUttara Bhadrapada  \nRevati.  \n  \n[paragraph continues] See also As. Res. IX. table of Nakshatras, 346. Agastya\nis Canopus; and the line of the goat, or Ajavithi, comprises asterisms which\ncontain stars in Scorpio and Sagittarius.\n\n[227:22](vp066.htm#fr_701) A marginal note in one MS. explains the phrase of\nthe text, ### to signify as far as to the moon and stars; but the Pitri yana,\nor path of the Pitris, lies amongst the asterisms; and, according to the\nPauran\xcc\x81ik system of the heavens, it is not clear what could be meant by its\nbeing bounded by the moon and stars. The path south of the solar orb is,\naccording to the Vedas, that of smoke or darkness.\n\n[227:23](vp066.htm#fr_702) The stars of the Nagavithi are those of Aries and\nTaurus; and by the seven Rishis we are here to understand Ursa Major.\n\n[227:24](vp066.htm#fr_703) This, according to the Vedas, is all that is to be\nunderstood of the immortality of the gods: they perish at the period of\nuniversal dissolution.\n\n[227:25](vp066.htm#fr_704) That is, generally as affecting created beings, not\nindividuals, whose acts influence their several successive births.\n\n[228:26](vp066.htm#fr_705) From Ursa Major to the polar star.\n\n[228:27](vp066.htm#fr_706) The popular notion is, that \xc5\x9aiva or Mahadeva\nreceives the Ganges on his head; but this, as subsequently explained, is\nreferred, by the Vaishn\xcc\x81avas at least, to the descent of the Alakananda, or\nGanges of India, not to the celestial Ganges.\n\n[229:28](vp066.htm#fr_707) Or, in other words, \'flows into the sea.\' The\nlegend here alluded to is more fully detailed in a subsequent book.\n\n[229:29](vp066.htm#fr_708) The situation of the source of the Ganges of heaven\nidentifies it with the milky way.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IX](vp067.htm)\n\n'
