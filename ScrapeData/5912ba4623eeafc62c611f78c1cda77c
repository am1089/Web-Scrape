There is no contradiction, as in the case of sandal-ointment.\n\nJust as a drop of sandal-ointment, although in actual contact with one spot of\nthe body only, yet produces a refreshing sensation extending over the whole\nbody; so the soul, although abiding in one point of the body only, may be the\ncause of a perception extending over the entire body. And as the soul is\nconnected with the skin (which is the seat of feeling), the assumption that\nthe soul's sensations should extend over the whole body is by no means\ncontrary to reason. For the connexion of the soul and the skin abides in the\nentire skin, and the skin extends over the whole body.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 24](sbe38025.htm)\n\n"
