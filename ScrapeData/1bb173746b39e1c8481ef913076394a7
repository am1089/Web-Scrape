Suta said :-- \xc2\x93O best of the Munis! I am now telling you the names of\nthe Pura _n_ as, etc., exactly as 1 have heard from Veda Vyasa, the son of\nSatyavati; listen.\n\n\n\nThe Pura _n_ a beginning with "ma" are two in number; those beginning with\n\xc2\x93bha\xc2\x94 are two; those beginning with \xc2\x93bra" are three; those beginning with "va\xc2\x94\nare four; those beginning respectively with \xc2\x93A\xc2\x94, \xc2\x93na\xc2\x94, \xc2\x93pa\xc2\x94, \xc2\x93Ling\xc2\x94, \xc2\x93ga\xc2\x94,\n\xc2\x93ku\xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93Ska\xc2\x94 are one each and \xc2\x93ma\xc2\x94 means Matsya Purana, Markandeya Purana;\n\xc2\x93Bha\xc2\x94 signifies Bhavi _s_ ya, Bhagavat Pura _n_ as; \xc2\x93Bra\xc2\x94 signifies Brahma,\nBrahma _nd_ a and Brahmavaivarta Pura _n_ as; \xc2\x93va\xc2\x94 signifies Vaman, Vayu, Vi\n_sn_ u and Varaha Pura _n_ as; \xc2\x93A\xc2\x94 signifies Agni Pura _n_ a; \xc2\x93Na\xc2\x94 signifies\nNarada Purana; \xc2\x93Pa\xc2\x94 signifies Padma Purana; \xc2\x93Ling\xc2\x94 signifies Linga Puranam;\n\xc2\x93Ga\xc2\x94 signifies Govinda Pura _n_ am; Ku signifies Kurma Purana and \xc2\x93Ska\xc2\x94\nsignifies Skanda Puranam. These are the eighteen Pura _n_ as. O Saunaka! In\nthe Matsya Pura _n_ a there are fourteen thousand slokas; in the wonderfully\nvaried Markandeya Puranam there are nine thousand slokas. In the Bhavisya Pura\n_n_ a fourteen thousand and five hundred slokas are counted by the Munis, the\nseers of truth. In the holy Bhagavata there are eighteen thousand S\xc2\x92lokas; in\nthe Brahma Pura _n_ a there are Ajuta (ten thousand) S\xc2\x92lokas. In the Brahma\n_nd_ a Pura _n_ a there are twelve thousand one hundred S\xc2\x92lokas; in the Brahma\nVaivarta Pura _n_ am there are eighteen thousand S\xc2\x92lokas. In the Vaman Pura\n_n_ a there are Ajuta (ten thousand) S\xc2\x92lokas; in the Vayu Pura _n_ am there\nare twenty-four thousand and six hundred S\xc2\x92lokas; in the greatly wonderful Vi\n_sn_ u Purana there are twenty-three thousand S\xc2\x92lokas; in the Agni Pura _n_ am\nthere are sixteen thousand S\xc2\x92lokas; in the Brihat Narada Pura _n_ am, there\nare twenty-five thousand S\xc2\x92lokas, in the big Padma Pura _n_ a there are fifty-\nfive thousand s\'lokas; in the voluminous Linga Pura _n_ a eleven thousand\ns\xc2\x92lokas exist; in the Garu _d_ a Pura _n_ am spoken by Hari nineteen thousand\ns\'lokas exist; iu the Kurma Pura _n_ a, seventeen thousand s\'lokas exist and\nin the greatly wonderful Skanda Pura _n_ a there are eighty-one thousand\ns\'lokas, O sinless Ri _s_ is! Thus I have described\n\n\n\np. 7\n\nto you the names of all the Pura _n_ as and the number of verses contained in\nthem. Now hear about the Upa Pura _n_ as.\n\n\n\n12-17. The first is the Upapura _n_ a narrated by Sanat Kumara; next comes\nNarasimha Pura _n_ a; then Naradiya Pura _n_ a, S\xc2\x92iva Pura _n_ a, Pura _n_ a\nnarrated by Durvasa, Kapila Pura _n_ a, Manava Pura _n_ a, Aus\xc2\x92anasa Pura _n_\na, Varu _n_ a Pura _n_ a. Kalika Pura _n_ a, Samva Pura _n_ a, Nandi Kes\xc2\x92wara\nPura _n_ a, Saura Pura _n_ a, Pura _n_ a spoken by Paras\xc2\x92ara, \xc3\x82ditya Pura _n_\na, Mahesvara Pura _n_ a, Bhagavata and Vasi _st_ ha Pura _n_ a. These Upa Pura\n_n_ as are described by the Mahatmas.\n\n\n\nAfter compiling the eighteen Pura _n_ as, Veda Vyasa, the son of Satyavati\ncomposed Mahabharata, that has no rival, out of these Pura _n_ as.\n\n\n\n18-24. At every Manvantara, in each Dvapara Yuga, Veda Vyasa expounds the Pura\n_n_ as duly to preserve the religion. Veda Vyasa is no other person than Vi\n_sn_ u Himself; He, in the form of Veda Vyasa, divides the (one) Veda into\nfour parts, in every Dvapara Yuga, for the good of the world. The Brahma _n_\nas of the Kali age are shortlived and their intellect (Buddhi) is not sharp;\nthey cannot realise the meaning after studying the Vedas; knowing this in\nevery Dvapara Yuga Bhagavan expounds the holy Pura _n_ a Samhitas. The more so\nbecause women, S\xc2\x92udras, and the lower Dvijas are not entitled to hear the\nVedas; for their good, the Pura _n_ as have been composed. Tne present\nauspicious Manvantara is Vaivasvata; it is the seventh in due order; and the\nson of Satyavati, the best of the knowers of Dharma, is the Veda Vyasa of the\n28th Dvapara Yuga of this seventh Manvantara. He is my Guru; in the next\nDvapara, Yuga Asvatthama, the son of Drona will be the Veda Vyasa. Twenty-\nseven Veda Vyasas had expired and they duly compiled each their own Purana\nSamhitas in their own Dvapara Yugas.\n\n\n\n25-35. The Ri _s_ is said :-- \xc2\x93O highly fortunate Suta! kindly describe to us\nthe names of the previous Veda Vyasas, the reciters of the Pura _n_ as in the\nDvapara Yugas.\n\n\n\nSuta said :-- In the first Dvapara, Brahma Himself divided the Vedas; in the\nsecond Dvapara, the first Prajapati Vyasa did the same; so S\xc2\x92akra, in the\nthird, Brihaspati, in the fourth, Surya in the fifth; Yama, in the sixth,\nIndra, in the seventh, Vasi _st_ ha, in the eighth; Sarasvata Ri _s_ i in the\nninth, Tridhama, in the tenth; Trivri _s_ a, in the eleventh, Bharadvaja, in\nthe twelfth; Antariksa, in the thirteenth; Dharma, in the fourteenth; Evaruni\nin the fifteenth; Dhananjaya, in the sixteenth; Medhatithi in tba seventeenth;\nVrati, in the eighteenth; Atri, in the nineteenth; Gautama in the twentieth,\nUttama, whose soul was fixed on Hari, in the twenty-first, Vajasrava Vena, in\nthe twenty second; his family descendant Soma\n\n\n\np. 8\n\n\n\niu the twenty-third; Trinavi _n_ du, in the twenty-fourth; Bhargava, in the\ntwenty-fifth; Sakti, in the twenty-sixth, Jatukar _n_ ya in the twenty-seventh\nand Kri _sn_ a Dvaipayana became the twenty-eighth Veda Vyas in the Dvapara\nYugas. Thus I have spoken of the 28 Veda Vyasas, as I heard. 1 have heard the\nholy S\xc2\x92rimad Bhagavat from the month of Kri _sn_ a Dvaipayana. This removes\nall troubles, yields all desires, and gives Moksa and is full of the meanings\nof the Vedas. This treatise contains the essence of all the S\xc2\x92astras and is\ndear always to the Mamuksas (those who want Moksa or liberation).\n\n\n\n36-43. O best Munis! Thus, compiling the Pura _n_ as Veda Vyasa thought this\nPura _n_ a to be the best; so (without teaching it to other persons) he\nsettled that his own son the high-sould S\xc2\x92uka Deva born of the dry woods used\nfor kindling fire (excited by attrition), having no passion for the worldly\nthings, would be the fit student to be taught this Pura _n_ a and therefore\ntaught him; at that time I was a fellow student along with S\xc2\x92aka Deva and I\nheard every thing from the mouth of Vyasa Deva and realised th\xc2\xab secret\nmeanings thereof. This has happened through the grace of the merciful Guru\nVeda Vyasa.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Third Chapter of S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam on praising the Pura\n_n_ as and on each Vyasa of every Dvapara Yuga.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 4](bk01ch04.htm)\n\n'
