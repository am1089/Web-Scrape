He should, during his lifetime, divide his wealth equally amongst his\nsons, excepting the eunuch, the mad man, and the outcast. 1\n\n2\\. On failure of sons the nearest Sapi _n_ _d_ a (takes the inheritance). 2\n\np. 134\n\n3\\. On failure of them the spiritual teacher (inherits); on failure of the\nspiritual teacher a pupil shall take (the deceased\'s wealth), and use it for\nreligious works for the (deceased\'s) benefit, or (he himself may enjoy it);\n\n4\\. Or the daughter (may take the inheritance). 4\n\n5\\. On failure of all (relations) let the king take the inheritance. 5\n\n6\\. Some declare, that the eldest son alone inherits. 6\n\n7\\. In some countries gold, (or) black cattle, (or) black produce of the earth\nis the share of the eldest. 7\n\n8\\. The chariot and the furniture in the house are the father\'s (share). 8\n\np. 135\n\n9\\. According to some, the share of the wife consists of her ornaments, and\nthe wealth (which she may have received) from her relations. 9\n\n10\\. That (preference of the eldest son) is forbidden by the _S_ astras. 10\n\n11\\. For it is declared in the Veda, without (marking) a difference (in the\ntreatment of the sons): Manu divided his wealth amongst his sons. 11\n\n12\\. Now the Veda declares also in conformity with (the rule in favour of the\neldest son) alone: They distinguish the eldest by (a larger share of) the\nheritage. 12\n\np. 136\n\n13\\. (But to this plea in favour of the eldest I answer): Now those who are\nacquainted with the interpretation of the law declare a statement of facts not\nto be a rule, as for instance (the following): \'Therefore amongst cattle,\ngoats and sheep walk together;\' (or the following), \'Therefore the face of a\nlearned Brahma _n_ a (a Snataka) is, as it were, resplendent;\' (or), \'A Brahma\n_n_ a who has studied the Vedas (a _S_ rotriya) and a he-goat evince the\nstrongest sexual desires.\' 13\n\n14\\. Therefore all (sons) who are virtuous inherit.\n\n15\\. But him who expends money unrighteously, he shall disinherit, though he\nbe the eldest son. 15\n\n16\\. No division takes place between husband and wife. 16\n\np. 137\n\n17\\. For, from the time of marriage, they are united in religious ceremonies,\n\n18\\. Likewise also as regards the rewards for works by which spiritual merit\nis acquired,\n\n19\\. And with respect to the acquisition of property.\n\n20\\. For they declare that it is not a theft if a wife spends money on\noccasions (of necessity) during her husband\'s absence. 20\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[133:1](sbe0249.htm#fr_653) **14**. The last Sutra of Kha _n_ _d_ a 13 and the\nfirst of Kha _n_ _d_ a 14 are quoted by Colebrooke, Digest, Book V, Text xlii,\nand Mitakshara, Chap. I, Sect. iii, Par. 6. Colebrooke translates _g_ ivan,\n\'during his lifetime,\' by \'who makes a partition during his lifetime.\' I think\nthat this is not quite correct, and that \xc3\x82pastamba intends to exhort\nhouseholders to make a division during their lifetime, as later they ought to\nbecome ascetics or hermits. Haradatta introduces into his commentary on this\nSutra the whole chapter on the division of a father\'s estate amongst his sons,\nsupplementing \xc3\x82pastamba\'s short rule by the texts of other lawyers. No doubt,\n\xc3\x82pastamba means to lay down, in these and the following Sutras, only the\nleading principles of the law of inheritance, and he intends that the\nremaining particulars should be supplied from the law of custom or other Sm\n_ri_ tis.\n\n[133:2](sbe0249.htm#fr_654) Haradatta gives in his commentary a full summary\nof the rules on the succession of remoter relations. One point only deserves\nspecial mention. He declares that it is the opinion of \xc3\x82pastamba, that widows\ncannot inherit. In this he is probably right, as \xc3\x82pastamba does not mention\nthem, and the use of the p. 134 masculine singular \'sapi _n_ _d_ a _h_ \' in\nthe text precludes the possibility of including them under that collective\nterm. It seems to me certain, that \xc3\x82pastamba, like Baudhayana, considered\nwomen, especially widows, unfit to inherit.\n\n[134:4](sbe0249.htm#fr_655) \'Some say "on failure of sons," others that the\nrule refers to the preceding Sutra (i.e. that the daughter inherits on failure\nof pupils only).\'--Haradatta. The latter seems to be the correct\ninterpretation.\n\n[134:5](sbe0249.htm#fr_656) \'Because the word "all" is used, (the king shall\ntake the estate) only on failure of Bandhus and Sagotras, i.e. gentiles within\ntwelve degrees.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[134:6](sbe0249.htm#fr_657) \'The other sons shall live under his protection.\'\n--Haradatta. Colebrooke, Mitakshara, Chap. I, Sect. iii, Par. 6.\n\n[134:7](sbe0249.htm#fr_658) \'"Black produce of the earth," i.e. black grain,\nor according to others black iron.\'--Haradatta. Compare for this and the\nfollowing Sutras Colebrooke, Mitakshara, Chap. I, Sect. iii, Par. 6, and\nDigest, Book V, Text xlviii.\n\n[134:8](sbe0249.htm#fr_659) The translation given above agrees with what I now\nrecognise to be Haradatta\'s explanation, and with Colebrooke, Mitakshara,\nChap. I, Sect. iii, Par. 6. Both the P. U. and Mr. U. MSS. of the U _g_ _g_\nvala read ratha _h_ pitura _m_ _s_ o g _ri_ he yatparibha _n_ _d_ am upakara\n_n_ am pi _th_ adi tadapi, \'the chariot (is) the father\'s share; the furniture\nwhich (is) in the house, that also.\' To this reading Mahadeva\'s U _g_ _g_ vala\non the Hira _n_ yake _s_ i Sutra points likewise, which gives pitur anta _h_.\nThe N. U. MS. of the U _g_ _g_ vala, according to which p. 135 I made the\ntranslation given in the Appendix to West and Buhler\'s Digest (1st edition),\nleaves out the word a _m_ _s_ a _h_ , and therefore makes it necessary to\ncombine this Sutra, with the preceding one, and to translate, \'The father\'s\nchariot and the furniture in the house (are) also (the share of the eldest).\'\nThis latter translation agrees nearly with that given by Colebrooke, Digest,\nBook V, Text xlviii, where this and the preceding Sutra have been joined; but\nthe chariot is not mentioned. A further variation in the interpretation of\nthis Sutra occurs in Colebrooke\'s Digest, Book V, Text lxxxix, and Mitakshara,\nloc. cit., where the words \'the furniture in the house\' are joined with Sutra\n9, and the furniture is declared to be the wife\'s share. Considering that\nSutra 9 is again quoted in Colebrooke\'s Digest, Book V, Text cccclxxii, and is\nnot joined with the latter part of Sutra 8, it is not too much to say that _G_\nagannatha has not shown any greater accuracy than his brethren usually do.\n\n[135:9](sbe0249.htm#fr_660) The Mitakshara, loc. cit., apparently takes the\nwords \'according to some\' as referring only, to property received from\nrelations. I follow Haradatta. The former interpretation is, however,\nadmissible, if the Sutra is split into two.\n\n[135:10](sbe0249.htm#fr_661) The _S_ astras are, according to Haradatta, the\nVedas.\n\n[135:11](sbe0249.htm#fr_662) Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita III, 1, 9, 4.\n\n[135:12](sbe0249.htm#fr_663) \'Athapi (now also) means "and certainly." They\ndistinguish, they set apart the eldest son by wealth: this has been declared\nin the Veda in conformity with (the rule regarding) one (heir, Sutra 6). He\ndenies (Sutra 13) that a passage also, which p. 136 agrees with the statement\nthat the eldest son alone inherits, is found in the Veda.\'--Haradatta. See\nTaittiriya Sa _m_ hita II, 5, 2, 7.\n\n[136:13](sbe0249.htm#fr_664) Those who are acquainted with the interpretation\nof the law are the Mima _m_ sakas. The translation of the second Vedic passage\nis by no means certain, as the root ribh, translated by \'to be resplendent,\'\nusually means \'to give a sound.\' Haradatta thinks that \xc3\x82pastamba means to show\nthat the passage \'Manu divided his wealth among his sons\' is likewise merely a\nstatement of facts, and cannot be considered a rule. This is probably\nerroneous, as Sutras 10 and 11 distinctly state, that the practice to allow\nthe eldest alone to inherit, is forbidden by the abovementioned passage of the\nVeda.\n\n[136:15](sbe0249.htm#fr_665) Compare for this Sutra and the following one\nColebrooke\'s Digest, Book V, Text cccxv. The translation of pratipadayati,\n\'expends,\' by \'gains,\' which is also proposed by _G_ agannatha, is against\n\xc3\x82pastamba\'s usage, see II, 5, 11, 17, and below, II, 8, 20, 19.\n\n[136:16](sbe0249.htm#fr_666) According to Haradatta, this Sutra gives the\nreason why, in Sutra 1, no share has been set apart for the wife. Compare\nColebrooke\'s Digest, Book V, Text lxxxix, for this Sutra and the following\ntwo.\n\n[137:20](sbe0249.htm#fr_667) See below, II, 11, 29, 3.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 6, Kha _n_ _d_ a 15](sbe0250.htm)\n\n'
