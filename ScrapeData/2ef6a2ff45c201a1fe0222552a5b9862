Brahma said :-- When I thus asked with great humility, the Devi\nBhagavati, the Prime S'akti, She addressed me thus in the following sweet\nwords :-- There is oneness always between me and the Puru _s_ a; there is\ndifference whatsoever at any time between me and the Puru _s_ a (Male, the\nSupreme Self). Who is I, that is Puru _s_ a; who is Puru _s_ a, that is I. The\ndifference between force and the receptacle of force is due to error. He who\nknows the subtle difference between us two, is certainly intelligent; he is\nfreed from this bondage of Samsara; there is no manner of doubt in this. The\nOne Secondless Eternal ever-lasting Brahma substance becomes dual at the time\nof creation. As a lamp, though one, becomes two by virtue of adjuncts; as a\nface, though one, becomes two, as reflected in a mirror; as one man becomes\ndouble by his shadow, we become reflected into many, by virtue of different\nAntah Kara _n_ as (mind, buddhi, and ahankara) created by Maya. The necessity\nof creation, again and again, after the Prakriti Pralayas is due to the\nfructification of those Karmas of the Jivas, whose fruits were not enjoyed\nbefore the Pralayas ; so when creation again commences, the above said dif-\n\n\n\np. 136\n\n\n\nferences are found to appear; Brahma is the material cause of these changes;\nwithout Brahma as the basis, the existence of Maya is simply impossible. It is\ntherefore that in Maya and Maya's action, Brahma is interwoven. For this\nreason as many differences are found in Maya, so many differences exist in\nBrahma.\n\n\n\nThe Maya and Brahma appear as two and hence all the differences, visible and\ninvisible, have come forth. Only during creation are these differences\nconceived. When everything melts away, i.e., there comes the Pralaya or\ngeneral dissolution, then, I am not female, I am not male, nor I am\nhermaphrodite. I then remain as Brahma with Maya latent in it. During the time\nof creation I am S\xc2\x92ri (wealth), Buddhi (intellect), Dhriti, (fortitude).\nSmriti (recollection), Sraddha (faith), Medha (intelligence), Daya (mercy),\nLajja (modesty), Kshudha (hunger), Trishna (thirst), Kshama (forgiveness),\nAkshama (non-forgiving), Kanti (lustre), Santi (peace), Pipasa (thirst), Nidra\n(sleep) Tandra (drowsiness), Jara (old age), Ajara (non old-age), Vidya\n(knowledge), Avidya (non-knowledge), Spriha (desires), Vanchha (desires),\nS'akti (force), As'akti (non-force), Vasa (fat), Majja (marrow), Tvak (skin),\nDri _st_ i (sight), Satyasatya Vakya (true and untrue words) and it is I that\nbecome Para, Madhyama, Pas'yanti, etc., the innumerable Nadis (tubular organs\nof the body, e. g., arteries, veins, intestines, blood vessels, pulses, etc.);\nthere are three koti and a half Na _d_ is (35 millions of Na _d_ is).\n\n\n\n11-13. O Brahma! See what substance is there in this Samsara, that is separate\nfrom Me? And what can you imagine with which I am not connected? So know this\nas certain that I am these all forms. O Creator! Say, is there any such thing,\nwhere you will not see my above mentioned positive form? So, in this creation,\nI am one, and I am many as well, in various forms. Know this as certain that\nit is I, that assuming the names of all the various Devas, exist in so many\nforms of S'aktis. It is I that manifest power and wield strength.\n\n\n\n14-27. O Brahma! I am Gauri, Brahmi, Raudri, Varahi, Vaisnavi, S\xc2\x92iva, Varuni,\nKauveri, Nara Sinhi, and Vasavi S'aktis. I enter in every substance, in\neverything of the nature of effect. Making that Puru _s_ a the instrument, I\ndo all the actions (rather Puru _s_ a is the efficient cause, the immediate\nagent). I am the coolness in water, the heat in fire, the lustre in the Sun,\nthe cooling rays in the Moon; and thus I manifest my my strength. O Brahma!\nVerily, I tell you this as certain that this universe becomes motionless, if\nit be abandoned by Me. If I leave S'ankara, he will not be able to kill the\nDaityas. A very weak man is declared to be as without any strength; he is not\nsaid to be without\n\n\n\np. 137\n\n\n\nRudra, or without Vi _sn_ u, nobody says like this; everyone says, he is\nwithout strength, without S'akti. Those who get fallen, tumbled, afraid,\nquiet, or under one's enemies are called powerless; no one says that this man\nis Rudraless and so forth. So the creation that you perform, know S\xc2\x92akti,\npower to be the cause thereof. When you will be endowed with that S\xc2\x92akti, you\nwill be able to create this whole Universe. Hari, Rudra, Indra, Agni, Chandra,\nSurya, Yama, Vis'vakarma, Varu _n_ a Pavana, and other Devas all are able to\ndo their karmas, when they are united respectively with their S'aktis. This\nEarth, when united with S\xc2\x92akti, remains fixed and becomes capable to hold all\nthe Jivas and beings. And if this Earth be devoid of force, She cannot hold an\natom even.\n\n\n\nThus Ananta, Kurma and all the other elephants of the eight points of the\ncompass, become able to do their respective works, only by My help (when\nunited with Me, the Force). O Lotus born! If I wish I can drink all the fire\nand waters today and I can hold wind in check. I do whatever I wish. If I say\nthat I am creating this world then the inconsistency arises thus :-- \xc2\x93When I\nam everything, then I am being eternal, all this universe, made up of\nPrapancha, becomes eternal.\xc2\x94 (Whereas this universe is not eternal in the\nsense that it is changing.) If it were said that this universe is different\nfrom Me, then My saying that I am everything becomes inconsistent. Thinking\nthus, do not plunge yourself in the doubt as to the reality and origin and\nseparateness of the non-eternal universe. For what is unreal, how can that\ncome into existence? The unreal substances can never come into existence; as\nthe child of a barren woman, the flowers in the sky are simply absurd. What is\nreal can only be born. In discussing about origin, birth, etc., the appearance\nand disappearance of real things is called their birth and dissolution. In the\ncold of earth there exists the previous existence of the jar and this is the\ncause of the appearance of the jar; the disappearance of the jar exists in the\njar; hence this disappearance is the cause of the destruction of the jar. Thus\nthe appearance and disappearance of the causal eternal things are called the\nOrigin and Pralaya. Similarly in discussing on the causal nature, there does\nnot arise an inconsistency in My being everything.\n\n\n\n28-48. So there is nothing to fear. In discussing about the reality of\neffects, this is to be conceived, that today there does not exist here the\nearth in the form of jar, if it is destroyed, where it has gone? The\nconclusion is that the earth in the form of jar exists in atoms. O Brahma! All\nsubstances eternal, existing for a moment only, the void, and the substances\nof the nature, real and unreal both, all are due to a cause.\n\n\n\np. 138\n\n\n\nAhankara is born first among them. Thus substances are of seven kinds: Mahat,\netc. O Unborn One! Mahattattva first arises from Prakriti; from Mahattattva\nsprings Ahamkara; and from Ahamkara arises other substances. Thus, in this\norder, you go on creating this Universe. O Brahma! Now you better go to your\nrespective places, and after creating the Universe, remain there and perform\nyour respective functions ordained by Prarabdha. Take this beautiful great\nS\xc2\x92akti Maha Sarasvati, full of Rajogu _n_ a, and of a smiling nature. This\nS'akti, wearing white clothes, adorned with divine ornaments and sitting on\nVarasana, will always be your playmate. This beautiful woman will always be\nyour boon companion; consider Her as My bibhuti (manifestation of power), and\nso most worshipful. Never show any sort of disrespect towards Her. Take Her\nand go immediately to Satyaloka; and from the seed of Mahattattva, create the\nfourfold beings from these. The subtle bodies (Linga sarira) and Karmas are\nremaining mixed up with each other. Separate them, as before, duly, in due\ntime.\n\n\n\nNow go on as before and according to Kala (time), Karma, and Svabhava\n(nature), join them with their respective attributes (sounds and other\nqualities); in other words bestow fruits according to their gu _n_ as and\nKarmas (Prarabdhas), and to the time when these fruits are due.\n\n\n\nVi _sn_ u is prominent in Sattvaguna and hence superior to You. So You should\nalways respect and worship Him. Whenever any difficulty will come to you, Vi\n_sn_ u will come down on earth to fulfil your ends. Janardan Vi _sn_ u will\nsometimes be born in the wombs of birds and animals, be sometimes in the wombs\nof men and destroy the Danavas. The highly powerful Maha Deva, too, will help\nyou. Now create the Devas and enjoy as you like. The Brahma _n_ as,\nKshattriyas, and Vaisyas will worship you, with devotion, in various\nsacrifices, endowed with due sacrificial fees. All the Devas will be always\nsatisfied when my name \xc2\x93Svaha\xc2\x94 will be uttered in the sacrificial oblations\nand ceremonies.\n\n\n\nS\xc2\x92iva, the incarnate of Tamo gu _n_ a will be revered and worshipped by all\npersons in every sacrifice. When the Devas will be frightened by the Daityas,\nthen Varahi, Vaisnavi, Gauri, Nara Simhi, S\xc2\x92achi, S'iva and My other S\xc2\x92aktis\nwill take excellent bodies and destroy your fear. So, O Lotus-born! Be at your\nease and do work. You utter and repeat my nine-lettered mantra with Vija and\nDhyan and do your work.\n\n\n\nO highly intelligent one! This nine-lettered mantra is the best of all the\nmantras. You are to keep this mantra, within your heart, for the\naccomplishment of all your ends.\n\n\n\np. 139\n\n\n\nThus saying to me, Bhagavati smiled and began to say to Vi _sn_ u :-- O Vi\n_sn_ u! Take this beautiful Maha Lak _s_ 'mi and go. She will always reside\nwithin your breast; there is no doubt in this. This all auspicious giving\nS\xc2\x92akti I give to you for your enjoyment.\n\n\n\nYou should always shew respect to Her; never show hatred or contempt. For the\ngood of the world, I unite thus Lak _s_ 'mi and Narayan. For your sustenance I\ncreate Yaj\xc3\xb1a. You three will act together in harmony unanimously.\n\n\n\nYou, Brahma and S\xc2\x92iva are my three Devas, born of my Gunas. You three will\nundoubtedly be respected and worshipped by the world.\n\n\n\nThe stupid man who will find any difference between you three, will go to\nhell; there is no doubt in this. He who is Hari, is S\xc2\x92iva; He who S\xc2\x92iva is\nHari; to make difference between these will lead one to hell. So Brahma is one\nand the same with S\xc2\x92iva and Vi _sn_ u; there no manner of doubt in this. O Vi\n_sn_ u! But there are other differences in their Gu _n_ as; I will tell this;\nlisten, as far as meditation of the Supreme Self is concerned you will have\nSattva Gu _n_ a predominant within you; and Rajo Gu _n_ a and Tamo Gu _n_ a\nwill be secondary. In various other pursuits and Vikaras (changes) better have\nRajo Gu _n_ a with Lak _s_ 'mi and always enjoy Her.\n\n\n\n49-85. O Lord of Rama! I give you Vakvija, Kamavija, and Mayavija that will\nlead you to the highest end. Take this Mantra and repeat it and enjoy as you\nlike. O Vi _sn_ u! By this, the danger of death, caused Kala, will never come\nto you. When the creation of this Universe will be completely done I will then\ndestroy this whole thing, moving and non-moving. You all will then be\ndissolved in Me. You should add pra _n_ ava this mantra with Kamavija leading\nto Mok _s_ a and repeat it always with auspicious motives. O Puru _s_ ottama!\nBuild your Vaikun _t_ hapuri; live there and think of this My Eternal Form and\nenjoy as you like.\n\n\n\nBrahma said :-- Saying thus to Vasudeva, that Higher Prakriti Devi who is all\nof the three Gu _n_ as and yet transcending them, began to address Maha Deva,\nthe Deva of the Devas, in sweet words, thus :-- O Sankara! Accept this\nbeautiful Maha Kali Gauri, build a new Kailas'a city and live there happily.\nYour primary Gu _n_ as will be Tamas; Sattva and Rajas will be your secondary\nGu _n_ as. Have recourse to Rajo and Tamo Gu _n_ as while you slay the Asuras\nand thus wander.\n\n\n\nO sinless S\xc2\x92ankara! Have recourse to peaceful Satto Gu _n_ a, when you reflect\non the Supreme Self and practise austerities. You all are for creating,\npreserving and destroying the Universe and you are all of the three\n\n\n\np. 140\n\n\n\nGu _n_ as. There is no such thing in this world as are devoid of these three\nGu _n_ as. Everything, that is visible, is endowed with the three Gu _n_ as,\nand whatever will be or was before cannot exist without them. Only the Supreme\nSelf is without these Gu _n_ as; but He is not visible. O Sankara! I am the\nPara Prakriti; at times I appear with Gu _n_ as; and at others I remain\nwithout any Gu _n_ as. O S\xc2\x92ambhu! I am always of the causal nature; never I am\nof the nature of effect. When I am causal, I am with Gu _n_ as; and when I am\nbefore the Highest Puru _s_ a, I am, then, without any Gu _n_ as on account of\nmy remaining in the state of equilibrium (Samya vastha). Mahattattva,\nAhamkara, and sound, touch, etc., all the Gu _n_ as perform the work of\nSamsara, day and night, each preceding one being the cause and each subsequent\none being the effect; never do they cease in their activities.\n\n\n\nFrom the Reality (Sat vastu) springs Ahamkara (Avyakta); therefore I am of the\nnature of causality; again Ahamkara is embodied with the three Gu _n_ as, and\nso the Pundits call it as an effect of mine. From Ahamkara arises Mahattattva;\nthis is denominated as Buddhi. So Mahattattva is the effect and Ahamkara is\nits cause. From Mahattattva arises again another Ahamkara; from this second\nAhamkara arise the five Tanmatras or the subtle elements. From these five\nTanmatras, the five gross elements arise after a process called Panchikara _n_\na. From the Sattvika part of the five Tanmatras, arise the five organs of\nperception; from their Rajasik part, the five organs of action come; from\ntheir Panchikara _n_ a, came the five gross elements; from the Sattvika\nportion of all the five elements comes mind. Thus sixteen things come into\nexistence. These organs of perception, etc., and other effects together with\nthe Maha bhutas form one Ga _n_ a, composed of the sixteen categories. The\noriginal Puru _s_ a is the Supreme Self; He is neither cause nor is He any\neffect. O S\xc2\x92ambhu! At the beginning of the creation, all the above things are\nborn in the way already indicated. Thus I have described to you, in brief;\nabout the creation. O Devas! Now get up in your aeroplane and go to your\nrespective places and fulfil your respective duties. Whenever you get into any\ndire distress, then remember Me; I will appear before you. O Devas! You should\nremember always the Eternal Supreme Self and Me. When you will remember us\nboth, all your actions, will, no doubt, be crowned with success.\n\n\n\nBrahma said :-- Bhagavati Durga gave us S\xc2\x92aktis, full of Divine beauty and\nlustre; She gave Maha Lak _s_ mi to Vi _sn_ u, Maha Kali to S\xc2\x92iva, and Maha\nSarasvati to me and bade good bye to us. Thus given farewell to by the Devi,\nwe three went to another place and were born as males. We thought of the very\nwonderful nature and influence of the Devi and\n\n\n\np. 141\n\n\n\nwe got upon our divine aeroplane. When we ascended, we saw there was no\nManidvipa, there was no Devi, there was no ocean of nectar, nothing\nwhatsoever. Save our aeroplane, we did not see anything. We then got into our\nwide aeroplane and reached there where Vi _sn_ u killed the two indomitable\nDaityas, in the great ocean, where I was born from the lotus.\n\n\n\nThus ends the Sixth Chapter of the Third Skandha on the description of the\nDevi's Vibhutis (powers) in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92rimad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyas.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 7](bk03ch07.htm)\n\n"
