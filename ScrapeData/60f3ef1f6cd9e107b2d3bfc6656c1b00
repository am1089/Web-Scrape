Be kind, O Agni, when we approach thee, as a friend a friend, as parents\n[1](sbe46078.htm#an_3:18:1:1), a straight leader. For full of deceit are the\ntribes of men: burn thou against (all) malign powers so that they turn back.\n\n2\\. Burn, O Agni, the nearer enemies, burn the curse of the distant evil-doer.\nBurn, O Vasu, seeing the unseen ones. May thy never-ageing, never-tiring\nflames [1](sbe46078.htm#an_3:18:2:1) spread out.\n\n3\\. Wishing for (thy blessings), O Agni, by fuel and ghee I offer this\nsacrificial food for (the attainment of) advancing power and of strength;\nworshipping thee with my spell as far as I have power (I offer) this divine\nprayer for the attainment of hundred(fold blessings).\n\n4\\. (Shining) forth with thy flame, O son of strength, praised (by us), bestow\nmighty vigour on those who toil for thee, bright luck and welfare, O Agni, on\nthe Vi _s_ vamitras! We have cleaned thy body many times.\n\n5\\. Give us treasures, O best gainer of riches: such indeed art thou, Agni,\nwhen thou hast been kindled. In the blessed praiser's house thou hast placed,\ntogether with wealth, thy mighty(?) arms [1](sbe46078.htm#an_3:18:5:1), thy\nmarvellous shapes.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 2 = T\xc3\x82. IV, 5, 5. Verse 3 = AV. III, 15,\n3.\n\np. 278\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. It is rather strange that Agni is compared with the two parents.\nGenerally it is the two A _s_ vins, or Heaven and Earth, or the pair of Indra\nand Varu _n_ a, &c.. who are compared with father and mother (see Hirzel,\nGleichnisse und Metaphern im Rigveda, 71 seq.). No doubt in our verse the dual\nwas chosen on account of the metre.--I do not think that Bollensen (Orient und\nOccident, II, 473) and Kirste (Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XVI, 297) are right in\nbelieving that a dative of pit _ri_ is found here, and in translating: 'as a\ngood (son) to his father.'\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The meaning of aya\xc2\xb4sa _h_ is doubtful; comp. Brugmann in Kuhn's\nZeitschrift, XXIV, 24 seq.; M. M., vol. xxxii, p. 371 (VI, 66, 5); von Bradke,\nFestgruss an Roth, 124.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. On s _ri_ pra, see I, 96, 3, note 3. Karasna must mean something like\n'arm,' though the exact meaning is doubtful. In VIII, 32, 10 the compound s\n_ri_ prakarasna occurs. Prof. Max Muller writes: 'Thou hast brightly assumed a\nbody with soft arms or with stretched-out arms, if we do not read s _ri_\nprakarasna.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 19](sbe46079.htm)\n\n"
