Verily, this--to wit, the A _s_ vamedha--is the king of\nsacrifices. But, indeed, the A _s_ vamedha is the Sacrificer, (for) the\nsacrifice is the Sacrificer: when he (the priest) binds victims to the horse\n(or, at the horse-sacrifice), he then, indeed, takes hold 3 of the sacrifice\nat the sacrifice.\n\n13:2:2:22\\. \'A horse, a hornless he-goat, and a Gom _ri_ ga 4\'\n\np. 299\n\nthese they bind to the central stake: thereby, indeed, he (the priest)\nsharpens the front of his (the Sacrificer\'s) army 1, whence the front of the\nking\'s army is sure to become terrible.\n\n13:2:2:33\\. A black-necked (he-goat), sacred to Agni, in front (of the horse)\nto its forehead 2: the original (hall) fire he makes it, whence the king\'s\nhall-fire is sure to be (efficient) 3.\n\np. 300\n\n13:2:2:44\\. An ewe, for Sarasvati, beneath the (horse\'s) jaws: he thereby\nmakes women to be dependent, whence women are sure to be attendant upon man.\n\n13:2:2:55\\. Two (he-goats), black on the lower part of the body 1, for the A\n_s_ vins, (he ties) to the front legs: he thereby lays strength into the front\nlegs, whence the king is sure to be strong in the arm 2.\n\n13:2:2:66\\. A dark-grey (he-goat) for Soma and Pushan at the (horse\'s) navel:\na foothold he makes this one; for Pushan is this (earth): it is thereon he\nestablishes himself.\n\n13:2:2:77\\. A white one and a black one, for Surya and Yama, on the flanks: a\nsuit of armour he makes those two: whence the king, clad in mail, performs\nheroic deeds.\n\n13:2:2:88\\. Two, with shaggy hind thighs, for Tvash _t_ _ri_ , to the hind\nlegs: he lays strength into the thighs, whence the king is sure to be strong\nin his thighs.\n\n13:2:2:99\\. A white one, for Vayu, to the tail,--an elevation he makes this\none, whence people in danger betake themselves to an elevated place 3;--a cow\nwont to cast her calf, for Indra, the ever active, in order to associate the\nsacrifice with Indra;--a dwarfish one for Vish _n_ u; for Vish _n_ u is the\nsacrifice: it is in the sacrifice he (the Sacrificer) thus finally establishes\nhimself.\n\n13:2:2:1010\\. These, then, are the fifteen \'parya\xe1\xb9\x85gya\' (body-encircling) 4\nanimals,--for fifteenfold is the\n\np. 301\n\nthunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means manly vigour: with that thunderbolt,\nmanly vigour, the Sacrificer now repels evil from in front 1 (of the\nsacrifice).\n\n13:2:2:1111\\. And fifteen (victims), indeed, are (bound) to each of the other\n(stakes);--for fifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means manly\nvigour: with that thunderbolt, manly vigour, the Sacrificer now repels evil on\nboth sides 2 (of the sacrifice).\n\n13:2:2:1212\\. As to this they say, \'Does he really repel evil by these?\' And,\nindeed, he does not make up the complete Pra _g_ apati, and does not here gain\neverything.\n\n13:2:2:1313\\. Let him rather bind seventeen animals to the central stake 3;\nfor seventeenfold is Pra _g_ apati, and the A _s_ vamedha is Pra _g_ apati,--\nthus for the\n\np. 302\n\nobtainment of the A _s_ vamedha. And sixteen (victims he binds) to each of the\nother (stakes), for of sixteen parts (kala) consists all this 1 (universe);\nall this (universe) he thus gains.\n\n13:2:2:1414\\. \'How is he to appease 2 these?\' they ask. \'Let him appease them\nwith the Barhaduktha verses 3, "Enkindled, anointing the lap of the\nfaithful(f.) . . .;" for B _ri_ haduktha, the son of Vamadeva, or A _s_ va,\nson of Samudra, saw these very (verses) to be the apri-verses of the horse: it\nis by means of these we appease it,\' so they say. But let him not do so; let\nhim appease it with the _G_ amadagna verses; for _G_ amadagni is Pra _g_\napati, and so is the A _s_ vamedha: he thus supplies it with its own deity;\nlet him therefore appease (the victims) with the _G_ amadagna verses 4.\n\n13:2:2:1515\\. Now some make the invitatory-formulas and the offering-formulas\n(to be pronounced) separately for the \'parya\xe1\xb9\x85gyas,\' saying, \'For these we find\n(formulas)--for the others, on account of not finding any, we do not use them\n5.\' Let him not do so;\n\np. 303\n\nfor the horse is the nobility (chieftain), and the other animals are the\npeasantry (clan); and those who do this really make the peasantry equal and\nrefractory to the nobility; and they also deprive the Sacrificer of his vital\npower. Therefore the horse alone belongs to Pra _g_ apati 1, and the others\nare sacred to the gods: he thus, indeed, makes the peasantry obedient and\nsubservient to the nobility; and he also supplies the Sacrificer with vital\npower.\n\n13:2:2:1616\\. The slaughtering-knife of the horse is made of gold, those of\nthe \'parya\xe1\xb9\x85gyas\' of copper, and those of the others of iron; for gold is\n(shining) light, and the A _s_ vamedha is the royal office: he thus bestows\nlight upon the royal office. And by means of the golden light (or, by the\nlight of the gold), the Sacrificer also goes to the heavenly world; and he,\nmoreover, makes it a gleam of light shining after him, for him to reach the\nheavenly world.\n\n13:2:2:1717\\. But, indeed, the horse is also the nobility; and this also--to\nwit, gold--is a form (symbol) of\n\np. 304\n\nthe nobility: he thus combines the nobility with the nobility.\n\n13:2:2:1818\\. And as to why there are copper (knives) for the \'parya\xe1\xb9\x85gyas,\'--\neven as the non-royal kingmakers, the heralds and headmen, are to the king, so\nthose \'parya\xe1\xb9\x85gyas\' are to the horse; and so, indeed, is this--to wit, copper--\nto gold: with their own form he thus endows them.\n\n13:2:2:1919\\. And as to why there are iron ones for the others,--the other\nanimals, indeed, are the peasantry, and this--to wit, iron--is a form of the\npeasantry: he thus combines the peasantry with the peasantry. On a rattan mat\n(lying) north (of the \xc3\x82havaniya) they cut the portions of the horse(-flesh);\nfor the horse is of anush _t_ ubh nature, and related to the Anush _t_ ubh is\nthat (northern) quarter: he thus places that (horse) in its own quarter. And\nas to (his doing so) on a rattan mat,--the horse was produced from the womb of\nthe waters 1, and the rattan springs from the water: he thus causes it to be\npossessed of its own (maternal) womb.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[298:3](sbe44084.htm#fr_756) \xc3\x82rabhate prapnoti, comm.; it might also be\nrendered by \'he enters upon the sacrifice.\'\n\n[298:4](sbe44084.htm#fr_757) This (and the identical passage [XIII, 5, 1,\n13](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:13)) looks like a quotation, as if quoted from Va _g_.\nS. XXIV, 1; where are p. 299 likewise found the references to the other\nvictims and their places, in [paragraphs\n2](sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:2)-[9](sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:9). Possibly, however, the\n\'iti\' may be used here with a kind of \'deiktic\' force (cf. the similar use in\n[XIII, 2, 8, 1](sbe44090.htm#13:2:8:1)); if, indeed, it does not simply refer\nto \'gom _ri_ ga,\' i.e. \'the animal called Gom _ri_ ga.\' (lit. \'bovine deer\'),\nregarding which see note on [XIII, 3, 4, 3](sbe44097.htm#13:3:4:3).--Though\nthe victims to be immolated on this day are first dealt with in this and the\nfollowing Brahma _n_ as, their slaughter only takes place at the usual time at\nevery Soma-sacrifice, viz. after the Sarpa _n_ am ([XIII, 2, 3,\n1](sbe44085.htm#13:2:3:1) seqq.), the chanting of the Bahishpavamana Stotra,\nand the drawing of the \xc3\x82 _s_ vina-graha. On the present occasion these\nceremonies are preceded by the drawing of the Mahiman cups of Soma (see [XIII,\n2, 11, 1](sbe44093.htm#13:2:11:1) seqq.); whilst the chant is followed by the\ndriving up of the victims, and the putting to of the horse, and the driving to\nthe water, treated of in [XIII, 2, 6, 1](sbe44088.htm#13:2:6:1) seqq.\n\n[299:1](sbe44084.htm#fr_758) Harisvamin takes this to mean that he makes the\n(sacrificial) horse, i.e. the king, alone the head of the army,--ra _g_\nabhutam apy a _s_ va _m_ senamukham eka _m_ karotity artha _h_.\n\n[299:2](sbe44084.htm#fr_759) According to the comments on Va _g_. S. XXIV, 1,\nand Katy. XX, 6, 4, a rope is wound round the horse\'s body in the same way as\nit is done with a bottle-gourd (lagenaria vulgaris), and it is to this rope\nthat these so-called \'parya\xe1\xb9\x85gyah (circumcorporal),\' or victims surrounding the\n(horse\'s) body, would then be tied.\n\n[299:3](sbe44084.htm#fr_760) The commentator explains \'bhavuka\' by \'sadhur\nbhavati;\' and he adds that this is important inasmuch as numerous magic rites,\nsuch as rites for insuring success and averting evil ( _s_ antikapaush _t_\nika), and incantations (abhi _k_ arika) are performed thereon. It is the name\nhere assigned to this, the \xc3\x82vasathya, fire, viz. \'purvagni\' or, original fire\n--with its secondary meaning \'front-fire\'--which is seized upon by the author\nfor symbolically identifying it with the victim fastened in front (or to the\nfront) of the horse.\n\n[300:1](sbe44084.htm#fr_761) Mahidhara takes \'adhorama\' to mean \'white-\ncoloured on the lower part of the body.\'\n\n[300:2](sbe44084.htm#fr_762) The word \'bahu\' means both \'arm\' and \'front leg.\'\n\n[300:3](sbe44084.htm#fr_763) That is, a mountain, a palace, high ground, &c.,\ncomm. (\'vayur hi skandhasyo _k_ _kh_ rita ity abhipraya _h_ \').\n\n[300:4](sbe44084.htm#fr_764) Here the encircled horse itself, and the other\ntwo victims p. 301 tied directly to the central stake, are improperly included\nin the term \'parya\xe1\xb9\x85gya.\'\n\n[301:1](sbe44084.htm#fr_765) Viz. inasmuch as the sacrificial stake to which\nthe horse is tied (and hence the victims fastened thereto) is the so-called\n\'agnish _th_ a\' stake, or the one standing opposite to (directly in front of)\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya fire.\n\n[301:2](sbe44084.htm#fr_766) Viz. inasmuch as these other stakes stand in a\nline to the north (left) and south (right) of the central stake. Whilst, in\nthe case of a simple \'ekada _s_ ini\' (cf. III, 7, 2, 1 seqq.) there would be\nfive stakes on each side of the central one, at the A _s_ vamedha there are to\nbe twenty-one stakes, or ten on either side of the central stake. See [XIII,\n4, 4, 5](sbe44105.htm#13:4:4:5) seqq.\n\n[301:3](sbe44084.htm#fr_767) These seventeen victims do not include the twelve\nparya\xe1\xb9\x85gyas which are tied to different parts of the horse\'s body, but only to\nthose which are actually tied to the central stake,--viz. the horse and its\ntwo immediate neighbours (paragraph 2), then twelve victims (enumerated Va\n_g_. S. XXIV, 2, beginning with three victims of different shades of red,\nrohita), and lastly two beasts belonging to two sets of eleven victims finally\nsuperadded to the sets of fifteen victims tied in the first place to the\nstakes. Cf. note on [XIII, 2, 5, 2](sbe44087.htm#13:2:5:2).\n\n[302:1](sbe44084.htm#fr_768) Regarding this division into sixteen parts, as\napplied to man, the animal, and the universe, see Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 111\nwith note.\n\n[302:2](sbe44084.htm#fr_769) Or, \'what \xc3\x82pris (appeasing verses) is he to\npronounce over them?\' These verses are pronounced as the offering-formulas (ya\n_g_ ya) at the fore-offerings of the animal sacrifice. See part ii, p. 185,\nnote 1.\n\n[302:3](sbe44084.htm#fr_770) Viz. Va _g_. S. XXIX, 1-11.\n\n[302:4](sbe44084.htm#fr_771) Viz. Va _g_. S. XXIX, 25-36, beginning,\n\'Enkindled in the house of man this day, a god, thou worshippest the gods, O\n_G_ atavedas.\'\n\n[302:5](sbe44084.htm#fr_772) The commentator takes this to mean that, inasmuch\nas these parya\xe1\xb9\x85gyas--here improperly including the horse itself and the two\nother victims of Pra _g_ apati at the central stake--are assigned to commonly\ninvoked deities, formulas relating to these would easily p. 303 be found;\nwhilst in the case of the other twelve victims tied to the central stake (see\np. 301, note 3), as well as those of the other stakes--though they, too, are\nassigned to definite deities--some of their deities (as in the case of three a\nyear and a half old heifers assigned to Gayatri, Va _g_. S. XXIV, 21), are\nsuch as to make it difficult to find suitable formulas for them:--etesham a\n_s_ vadina _m_ pra _g_ apatvadika ya _g_ yanuvakyas ta _h_ kim iti na p _ri_\nthak kurma _h_ ; itaresha _m_ rohitadina _m_ na vindama _h_ , tryavayo\ngayatryadayo devatas taddevatya _s_ _k_ a durlabha laksha _n_ opeta ya _g_\nyanuvakya ity abhipraya _h_.\n\n[303:1](sbe44084.htm#fr_773) The invitatory-formula and offering-formula are,\nhowever, pronounced once for the \'parya\xe1\xb9\x85gyas\' (including the horse) in common,\nwhilst a second pair of formulas are used for the other victims in common.\n\n[304:1](sbe44084.htm#fr_774) See VI, 1, 1, 11 (V, 1, 4, 5).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 2, 3.
