Charm with the plant silaki (laksha, arundhati) for the cure of\nwounds.\n\n1\\. The night is thy mother, the cloud thy father, Aryaman thy grandfather.\nSilaki, forsooth, is thy name, thou art the sister of the gods.  \n2\\. He that drinks thee lives; (that) person thou dost preserve. For thou art\nthe supporter of all successive (generations), the refuge of men.  \n3\\. Every tree thou dost climb, like a wench lusting after a man.\n'Victorious,' 'firmly founded,' 'saving,' verily, is thy name.  \n4\\. The wound that has been inflicted by the club, by the arrow, or by fire,\nof that thou art the cure: do thou cure this person here!  \n5\\. Upon the noble plaksha-tree (ficus infectoria) thou growest up, upon the\nasvattha (ficus religiosa), the khadira (acacia catechu), and the dhava\n(grislea tomentosa); (thou growest up) upon the noble nyagrodha (ficus indica,\nbanyan-tree), and the parna (butea frondosa). Come thou to us, O arundhati!  \n6\\. O gold-coloured, lovely, sun-coloured, most handsome (plant), mayest thou\ncome to the fracture, O cure! 'Cure,' verily, is thy name!  \n7\\. O gold-coloured, lovely, fiery (plant), with hairy stem, thou art the\nsister of the waters, O laksha, the wind became thy very breath.  \n8\\. Silaki is thy name, O thou that art brown as a goat, thy father is the son\nof a maiden. With the blood of the brown horse of Yama thou hast verily been\nsprinkled.  \n9\\. Having dropped from the blood of the horse she ran upon the trees, turning\ninto a winged brook. Do thou come to us, O arundhati!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 109.
