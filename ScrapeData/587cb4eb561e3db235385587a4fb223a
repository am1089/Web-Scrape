Now once on a time the gods, while performing sacrifice, were\nafraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They said, 'Who of us shall sit on\nthe south side; we will then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a\nplace free from danger and injury.'\n\n4:6:6:22\\. They said, 'He who is the strongest of us, let him sit on the south\nside; we will then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free\nfrom danger and injury.'\n\n4:6:6:33\\. They said, 'Verily, Indra is the strongest of us: let Indra sit on\nthe south side; we will then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a\nplace free from danger and injury.'\n\n4:6:6:44\\. They said to Indra, 'Verily, thou art the strongest of us: sit thou\non the south side; we will then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in\na place free from danger and injury.'\n\n4:6:6:55\\. He said, 'What will be my reward then?'--'The office of Brahma _n_\na _kh_ a _m_ sin shall be thine, the\n\np. 434\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahmasaman 1 shall be thine!'--Hence one elects the\nBrahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin with, 'Indra is the Brahman, by virtue of the\nBrahmaship!' for to Indra belongs this (office). Indra sat on the south side,\nand they entered upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free from\ndanger and injury. Therefore let him who is the strongest sit on the south\nside, and let them then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place\nfree from danger and injury. Now he, forsooth, who is the most learned of\nBrahmans, is the strongest of them; and as now any one is (able to become) a\n(superintendent) Brahman 2\\--nay, does he not sit still?--therefore whosoever\nis the strongest\n\np. 435\n\nof them, let him sit on the south side, and let them then enter upon the\nsacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury. Hence\nBrahmans sit on the south side (of the vedi), and they enter upon the\nsacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury.\n\n4:6:6:66\\. When (the Prastot _ri_ ) says, 'Brahman, we will chant, O Pra _s_\nastar!' then the Brahman mutters (Va _g_.. S. II, 12), 'This thy sacrifice, O\ndivine Savitar, have they announced unto B _ri_ haspati (the lord of prayer),\nthe Brahman 1: therefore speed the sacrifice, speed the lord of the sacrifice,\nspeed me 2!--Praise ye at the impulse (prasava) of Savit _ri_!' The\nsignificance is the same (as before) 3. With this (text) must probably enter\nupon (the chant).\n\n4:6:6:77\\. But one may also enter upon it with, 'O divine Savitar; this, O B\n_ri_ haspati, forwards!' Therewith he hastes to Savit _ri_ for his impulsion,\nfor he is the impeller (prasavit _ri_ ) of the gods; and 'O B _ri_ haspati,\nforwards!' he says, because B _ri_ haspati is the Brahman of the gods,--thus\nhe announces it to him who is the Brahman of the gods: therefore he says, 'O B\n_ri_ haspati, forwards 4!'\n\n4:6:6:88\\. The Maitravaru _n_ a then mutters, 'Impelled\n\np. 436\n\nby the divine Savit _ri_ , acceptable to Mitra and Varu _n_ a!' Therewith he\nhastes to Savit _ri_ for his impulsion, for he is the impeller of the gods;\nand 'acceptable to Mitra and Varu _n_ a' he says, because Mitra and Varu _n_ a\nare the deities of the Maitravaru _n_ a (Pra _s_ ast _ri_ ),--thus he\nannounces it to those who are the deities of the Maitravaru _n_ a: therefore\nhe says, 'acceptable to Mitra and Varu _n_ a.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[434:1](sbe2675.htm#fr_1012) That is, the Saman which supplies the text for\nthe Stotra chanted in connection with the Brahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin's\nSastra, and forming the Stotriya verse of the latter. Thus, at the midday\nsavana, the (P _ri_ sh _th_ a) Stotra of that priest usually consists of the\nNaudhasa-saman (Sama-veda II, 35-36), if the Rathantara-saman (Sama-vela II,\n30-31) is used for the Hot _ri_ 's Stotra; but, if the B _ri_ hat-saman (ib.\nII, 159-160) is used for the latter, then the _S_ yaita-saman (II, 161-2) is\nused as the Brahma-saman. See [p. 339](sbe2652.htm#page_339), note\n[2](sbe2652.htm#fn_801). The reason, however, why special mention is made of\nthe Brahma _n_ a _kh_ a _m_ sin in this place, probably is that at the Gavam\nayana the Brahma-saman is treated in a peculiar way. For, while on 142 days of\nthe first half of the year,--viz. on the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a, on all (6 \xc3\x97 23)\n\xc3\x82bhiplavika days and on the three Svara-saman days,--one and the same tune,\nthe Abhivarta-saman, is to be used day by day, but each time with a different\npragatha stanza (thus the pragatha S. V. II, 35-36, usually chanted to the\nNaudhasa tune, being on this occasion chanted to the Abhivarta tune); on the\ncorresponding days of the second half of the year, one and the same stanza,\n'Indra kratu _m_ na a bhara' (S. V. II, 806-7), is to be used day by day, but\nwith different tunes (six such being given in the Calc. ed. vol. iv, pp.\n529-34). Ta _n_ _d_ ya Br. IV, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[434:2](sbe2675.htm#fr_1013) According to XII, 6, I, 40 only priests of the\nVasish _th_ a family could become Brahmans, or superintendent priests, in\nolden times; because they alone knew the Somabhaga mantras; but now every one\nlearns them, and can therefore become a Brahman.\n\n[435:1](sbe2675.htm#fr_1014) Mahidhara interprets, 'This sacrifice, O divine\nSavitar, they announce to thee and to B _ri_ haspati, the Brahman.' Perhaps\nthe correct meaning (though not that assumed by the Brahma _n_ a) is, 'This\nsacrifice they announce to thee as the B _ri_ haspati, the Brahman!' and\nsimilarly the mantra in the next paragraph.\n\n[435:2](sbe2675.htm#fr_1015) The Ka _n_ va text adds here the verse Va _g_. S.\nII, 13; see _S_ at. Br. I, 7, 4, 22, with the same various reading 'gyotir.'\n\n[435:3](sbe2675.htm#fr_1016) See I, 7, 4, 21.
