Hymn to goddess Earth.\n\n1\\. Truth, greatness, universal order (rita), strength. consecration, creative\nfervour (tapas), spiritual exaltation (brahma), the sacrifice, support the\nearth. May this earth, the mistress of that which was and shall be, prepare\nfor us a broad domain!  \n2\\. The earth that has heights, and slopes, and great plains, that supports\nthe plants of manifold virtue, free from the pressure that comes from the\nmidst of men, she shall spread out for us, and fit. herself for us!  \n3\\. The earth upon which the sea, and the rivers and the waters, upon which\nfood and the tribes of men have arisen, upon which this breathing, moving life\nexists, shall afford us precedence in drinking!  \n4\\. The earth whose are the four regions of space, upon which food and the\ntribes of men have arisen, which supports the manifold breathing, moving\nthinas, shall afford us cattle and other possessions also!  \n5\\. The earth upon which of old the first men unfolded themselves, upon which\nthe gods overcame the Asuras, shall procure for us (all) kinds of cattle,\nhorses, and fowls, good fortune, and glory!  \n6\\. The earth that supports all, furnishes wealth, the foundation, the golden-\nbreasted resting-place of all living creatures, she that supports Agni\nVaisvanara (the fire), and mates with Indra, the bull, shall furnish us with\nproperty!  \n7\\. The broad earth, which the sleepless gods ever attentively guard, shall\nmilk for us precious honey, and, moreover, besprinkle us with glory!  \n8\\. That earth which formerly was water upon the ocean (of space), which the\nwise (seers) found out by their skilful devices; whose heart is in the highest\nheaven, immortal, surrounded by truth, shall bestow upon us brilliancy and\nstrength, (and place us) in supreme sovereignty!  \n9\\. That earth upon which the attendant waters jointly flow by day and night\nunceasingly, shall pour out milk for us in rich streams, and, moreover,\nbesprinkle us with glory!  \n10\\. The earth which the Asvins have measured, upon which Vishnu has stepped\nout, which Indra, the lord of might, has made friendly to himself; she, the\nmother, shall pour forth milk for me, the son!  \n11\\. Thy snowy mountain heights, and thy forests, O earth, shall be kind to\nus! The brown, the black, the red, the multi-coloured, the firm earth, that is\nprotected by Indra, I have settled upon, not suppressed, not slain, not\nwounded.  \n12\\. Into thy rniddle set us, O earth, and into thy navel, into the nourishing\nstrength that has grown tip from thy body; purify thyself for us! The earth is\nthe mother, and I the son of the earth; Paro-anya is the father; he, too,\nshall save us!  \n13\\. The earth upon which they (the priests) inclose the altar (vedi), upon\nwhich they, devoted to all (holy) works, unfold the sacrifice, upon which are\nset up, in front of the sacrifice, the sacrificial posts, erect and brilliant,\nthat earth shall prosper us, herself prospering!  \n14\\. Him that hates us, O earth, him that battles against us, him that is\nhostile towards us with his mind and his weapons, do thou subject to us,\nanticipating (our wish) by deed!  \n15\\. The mortals born of thee live on thee, thou supportest both bipeds and\nquadrupeds. Thine, O earth, are these five races of men, the mortals, upon\nwhom the rising sun sheds undying light with his rays.  \n16\\. These creatures all together shall yield milk for us; do thou, O earth,\ngive us the honey of speech!  \n17\\. Upon the firm, broad earth, the all-begetting mother of the plants, that\nis supported by (divine) law, upon her, propitious and kind, may we ever pass-\nour lives!  \n18\\. A great gathering-place thou, great (earth), hast become; great haste,\ncommotion, and agitation are upon thee. Great Indra protects thee unceasingly.\nDo thou, O earth, cause us to brighten as if at the sight of gold: not any one\nshall hate us!  \n19\\. Agni (fire) is in the earth, in the plants, the waters hold Agni, Agni is\nin the stones; Agni is within men, Agnis (fires) are within cattle, within\nhorses.  \n20\\. Agni glows from the sky, to Agni, the god, belongs the broad air. The\nmortals kindle Agni, the bearer of oblations, that loveth ghee.  \n21\\. The earth, clothed in Agni, with dark knees, shall make me brilliant and\nalert!  \n22\\. Upon the earth men give to the gods the sacrifice, the prepared oblation;\nupon the earth mortal men live pleasantly by food. May this earth give us\nbreath and life, may she cause me to reach old age!  \n23\\. The fragrance, O earth, that has arisen upon thee, which the plants and\nthe waters hold, which the Gandharvas and the Apsaras have partaken of, with\nthat make me fragrant: not any one shall hate us!  \n24\\. That fragrance of thine which has entered into the lotus, that fragrance,\nO earth, which the immortals of yore gathered up at the marriage of Surya,\nwith that make me fragrant: not any one shall hate us!  \n25\\. That fragrance of thine which is in men, the loveliness and charm that is\nin male and female, that which is in steeds and heroes, that which is in the\nwild animals with trunks (elephants), the lustre that is in the maiden, O\nearth, with that do thou blend us: not any one shall hate us!  \n26\\. Rock, stone, dust is this earth; this earth is supported, held together.\nTo this golden-breasted earth I have rendered obeisance.  \n27\\. The earth, upon whom the forest-sprung trees ever stand firm, the all-\nnourishing, compact earth, do we invoke.  \n28\\. Rising or sitting, standing or walking, may we not stumble with our right\nor left foot upon the earth!  \n29\\. To the pure earth I speak, to the ground, the soil that has grown through\nthe brahma (spiritual exaltation). Upon thee, that holdest nourishment,\nprosperity, food, and ghee, we would settle down, O earth!  \n30\\. Purified the waters shall flow for our bodies; what flows off from us\nthat do we deposit upon him we dislike: with a purifier, O earth, do I purify\nmyself!  \n31\\. Thy easterly regions, and thy northern, thy southerly (regions), O earth,\nand thy western, shall be kind to me as I walk (upon thee)! May I that have\nbeen placed into the world not fall down!  \n32\\. Do not drive us from the west, nor from the east; not from the north, and\nnot from the south! Security be thou for us, O earth: waylayers shall not find\nus, hold far away (their) murderous weapon!  \n33\\. As long as I look out upon thee, O earth, with Surya (the sun) as my\ncompanion, so long shall my sight not fall, as year followeth upon year!  \n34\\. When, as I lie, I turn upon my right or left side, O earth; when\nstretched out we lie with our ribs upon thee pressing against (us), do not, O\nearth, that liest close to everything, there injure us!  \n35\\. What, O earth, I dig out of thee, quickly shall that grow again: may I\nnot, O pure one, pierce thy vital spot, (and) not thy heart!  \n36\\. Thy summer, O earth, thy rainy season, thy autumn, winter, early spring,\nand spring; thy decreed yearly seasons, thy days and nights shall yield us\nmilk  \n37\\. The pure earth that starts in fright away from the serpent, upon whom\nwere the fires that are within the waters, she that delivers (to destruction)\nthe blasphemous Dasyus, she that takes the side of Indra, not of Vritra, (that\nearth) adheres to Sakra (mighty Indra), the lusty bull.  \n38\\. Upon whom rests the sacrificial hut (sadas) and the (two) vehicles that\nhold the soma (havirdhane), in whom the sacrificial post is fixed, upon whom\nthe Brahmanas praise (the gods) with riks and samans, knowing (also) the\nyagur-formulas; upon whom the serving-priests (ritvig) are employed so that\nIndra shall drink the soma;--  \n39\\. Upon whom the seers of yore, that created the beings, brought forth with\ntheir songs the cows, they the seven active (priests), by means of the satra-\nofferings, the sacrifices, and (their) creative fervour (tapas);--  \n40\\. May this earth point out to us the wealth that we-crave; may Bhaga\n(fortune) add his help, may Indra come here as (our) champion!  \n41\\. The earth upon whom the noisy mortals sing and dance, upon whom they\nfight, upon whom resounds the roaring drum, shall drive forth our enemies,\nshall make us free from rivals!  \n42\\. To the earth upon whom are food, and rice and barley, upon whom live\nthese five races of men, to the earth, the wife of Parganya, that is fattened\nby rain, be reverence!  \n43\\. The earth upon whose ground the citadels constructed by the gods unfold\nthemselves, every region of her that is the womb of all, Pragapati shall make\npleasant for us!  \n44\\. The earth that holds treasures manifold in secret places, wealth, jewels,\nand gold shall she give to me; she that bestows wealth liberally, the kindly\ngoddess, wealth shall she bestow upon us!  \n45\\. The earth that holds people of manifold varied speech, of different\ncustoms, according to their habitations, as a reliable milch-cow that does not\nkick, shall she milk for me a thousand streams of wealth!  \n46\\. The serpent, the scorpion with thirsty fangs, that hibernating torpidly\nlies upon thee; the worm, and whatever living thing, O earth, moves in the\nrainy season, shall, when it creeps, not creep upon us: with what is\nauspicious (on thee) be gracious to us!  \n47\\. Thy many paths upon which people go, thy tracks for chariots and wagons\nto advance, upon which both good and evil men proceed, this road, free from\nenemies, and free from thieves, may we gain: with what is auspicious (on thee)\nbe gracious to us!  \n48\\. The earth holds the fool and holds the wise, endures that good and bad\ndwell (upon her); she keeps company with the boar, gives herself up to the\nwild hog.  \n49\\. Thy forest animals, the wild animals homed in the woods, the man-eating\nlions, and tigers that roam; the ula, the wolf, mishap, injury (rikshika), and\ndemons (rakshas), O earth, drive away from us!  \n50\\. The Gandharvas, the Apsaras, the Arayas and Kimidins; the Pisakas and all\ndemons (rakshas), these, O earth, hold from us!  \n51\\. The earth upon whom the biped birds fly together, the flamingoes, eagles,\nbirds of prey, and fowls; upon whom Matarisvan, the wind, hastens, raising the\ndust, and tossing the trees-as the wind blows forth and back the flame bursts\nafter;--  \n52\\. The earth upon whom day and night jointly, black and bright, have been\ndecreed, the broad earth covered and enveloped with rain, shall kindly place\nus into every pleasant abode!  \n53\\. Heaven, and earth, and air have here given me expanse; Agni, Surya, the\nwaters, and all the gods together have given me wisdom.  \n54\\. Mighty am I, 'Superior' (uttara) by name, upon the earth, conquering am\nI, all-conquering, completely conquering every region.  \n55\\. At that time, O goddess, when, spreading., (prathamana) forth, named\n(prithivi 'broad') by the gods, thou didst extend to greatness, then\nprosperity did enter thee, (and) thou didst fashion the four regions.  \n56\\. In the villages and in the wilderness, in the assembly-halls that are\nupon the earth; in the gatherings, and in the meetings, may we hold forth\nagreeably to thee!  \n57\\. As dust a steed did she, as soon as she was born, scatter these people,\nthat dwelt upon the earth, she the lovely one, the leader, the guardian of the\nworld, that holds the trees and plants.  \n58\\. The words I speak, honied do I speak them: the things I see they furnish\nme with. Brilliant I am and alert: the others that rush (against me) do I beat\ndown.  \n59\\. Gentle, fragrant, kindly, with the sweet drink (kilala) in her udder,\nrich in milk, the broad earth together with (her) milk shall give us courage!  \n60\\. She whom Visvakarman (the creator of all) did search out by means of\noblations, when she had entered the surging (flood of the) atmosphere, she,\nthe vessel destined to nourish, deposited in a secret place, became visible\n(to the gods) and the (heavenly) mothers.  \n61\\. Thou art the scatterer of men, the broadly expanding Aditi that yields\nmilk according to wish. What is wanting in thee Pragapati, first-born of the\ndivine order (rita), shall supply for thee  \n62\\. Thy laps, O earth, free from ailment! Free from disease, shall be\nproduced for us! May we attentively, throuoh our long lives, be bearers of\nbali-offerings to thee!  \n63\\. O mother earth, kindly set me down upon a well-founded place! With\n(father) heaven cooperating, O thou wise one, do thou place me into happiness\nand prosperity!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 1.
