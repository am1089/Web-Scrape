And on account of denial.\n\nTexts such as 'This is that great unborn Self, undecaying, undying' (B _ri_.\nUp. IV, 4, 25), 'By the old age of the body that does not age' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVIII, 1, 5), deny of Brahman the properties of non-sentient matter. From this\nit follows that the relation of the two can only be that of distinguishing\nattribute and thing distinguished, and hence of part and whole. Brahman\ndistinguished by sentient and non-sentient beings in their subtle state is the\ncause; distinguished by the same beings in their gross state is the effect:\nthe effect thus is non-different from the cause, and by the knowledge of the\ncausal Brahman the effect is likewise known. All these tenets are in full\nmutual agreement. Brahman's freedom from defects also is preserved; and this\nand Brahman's being the abode of all blessed qualities prove that Brahman\npossesses the 'twofold characteristics.'--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a\nof 'the coils of the snake.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 30.
