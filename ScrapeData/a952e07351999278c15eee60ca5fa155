The second book, which we now begin, is the Book of the Means\nof Soul Growth. And we must remember that soul growth here means the growth of\nthe realization of the spiritual man, or, to put the matter more briefly, the\ngrowth of the spiritual man, and the disentangling of the spiritual man from\nthe wrappings, the veils, the disguises laid upon him by the mind and the\npsychical nature, wherein he is enmeshed, like a bird caught in a net.\n\nThe question arises: By what means may the spiritual man be freed from these\npsychical meshes and disguises, so that he may stand forth above death, in his\nradiant eternalness and divine power? And the second book sets itself to\nanswer this very question, and to detail the means in a way entirely practical\nand very lucid, so that he who runs may read, and he who reads may understand\nand practise.\n\nThe second part of the second book is concerned with practical spiritual\ntraining, that is, with the earlier practical training of the spiritual man.\n\nThe most striking thing in it is the emphasis laid on the Commandments, which\nare precisely those of the latter part of the Decalogue, together with\nobedience to the Master. Our day and generation is far too prone to fancy that\nthere can be mystical life and growth on some other foundation, on the\nfoundation, for example, of intellectual curiosity or psychical selfishness.\nIn reality, on this latter foundation the life of the spiritual man can never\nbe built; nor, indeed, anything but a psychic counterfeit, a dangerous\ndelusion.\n\nTherefore Patanjali, like every great spiritual teacher, meets the question:\nWhat must I do to be saved? with the age-old answer: Keep the Commandments.\nOnly after the disciple can say, These have I kept, can there be the further\nand finer teaching of the spiritual Rules.\n\nIt is, therefore, vital for us to realize that the Yoga system, like every\ntrue system of spiritual teaching, rests on this broad and firm foundation of\nhonesty, truth, cleanness, obedience. Without these, there is no salvation;\nand he who practices these, even though ignorant of spiritual things, is\nlaying up treasure against the time to come.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book II](ysp04.htm)\n\n"
