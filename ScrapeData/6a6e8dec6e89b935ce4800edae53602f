II\n\nThe conception of Devaki: her appearance: she is praised by the gods.\n\nTHE nurse of the universe, Jagaddhatri, thus enjoined by the god of gods,\nconveyed the six several embryos into the womb of Devaki 1, and transferred\nthe seventh after a season to that of Rohin\xcc\x81i; after which, Hari, for the\nbenefit of the three regions, became incarnate as the conception of the former\nprincess, and Yoganidra as that of Ya\xc5\x9boda, exactly as the supreme Vishn\xcc\x81u had\ncommanded. When the portion of Vishn\xcc\x81u had become incorporate upon earth, the\nplanetary bodies moved in brilliant order in the heavens, and the seasons were\nregular and genial. No person could bear to gaze upon Devaki, from the light\nthat invested her; and those who contemplated her radiance felt their minds\ndisturbed. The gods, invisible to mortals, celebrated her praises continually\nfrom the time that Vishn\xcc\x81u was contained in her person. "Thou," said the\ndivinities, "art that Prakriti, infinite and subtile, which formerly bore\nBrahma in its womb: then wast thou the goddess of speech, the energy of the\ncreator of the universe, and the parent of the Vedas. Thou, eternal being,\ncomprising in thy substance the essence of all created things, wast identical\nwith creation: thou wast the parent of the triform sacrifice, becoming the\ngerm of all things: thou art sacrifice, whence all fruit proceeds: thou art\nthe wood, whose attrition engenders fire. As Aditi, thou art the parent of the\ngods; as Diti, thou art the mother of the Daityas, their foes. Thou art light,\nwhence day is begotten: thou art humility, the mother of true wisdom: thou art\nkingly policy, the parent of order: thou art modesty, the progenitrix of\naffection: thou art desire, of whom love is born: thou art contentment, whence\nresignation is derived: thou art intelligence, the mother of knowledge: thou\nart patience, the parent of fortitude: thou art the heavens, and thy children\nare the stars: and from thee does all that exists proceed. Such, goddess,\n\np. 501\n\nand thousands more, are thy mighty faculties; and now innumerable are the\ncontents of thy womb, O mother of the universe. The whole earth, decorated\nwith oceans, rivers, continents, cities, villages, hamlets, and towns; all the\nfires, waters, and winds; the stars, asterisms, and planets; the sky, crowded\nwith the variegated chariots of the gods, and ether, that provides space for\nall substance; the several spheres of earth, sky, and heaven; of saints,\nsages, ascetics, and of Brahma; the whole egg of Brahma, with all its\npopulation of gods, demons, spirits, snake-gods, fiends, demons, ghosts, and\nimps, men and animals, and whatever creatures have life, comprised in him who\nis their eternal lord, and the object of all apprehension; whose real form,\nnature, name, and dimensions are not within human apprehension--are now with\nthat Vishn\xcc\x81u in thee. Thou art Swaha; thou art Swadha; thou art wisdom,\nambrosia, light, and heaven. Thou hast descended upon earth for the\npreservation of the world. Have compassion upon us, O goddess, and do good\nunto the world. Be proud to bear that deity by whom the universe is upheld."\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[500:1](vp119.htm#fr_1464) It is mentioned in the preceding chapter that they\nwere all put to death, in which the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba concurs. The Bhagavata makes\nKansa spare them, and restore them to their parents, as he had nothing to\napprehend from their existence.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III](vp120.htm)\n\n'
