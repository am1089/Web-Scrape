Or else (the relation of the two is to be conceived) in the manner stated\nabove.\n\nOr else the relation of the two has to be conceived in the manner suggested by\nSutra 25. For if the bondage of the soul is due to Nescience only, final\nrelease is possible. But if the soul is really and truly bound--whether the\nsoul be considered as a certain condition or state of the highest Self as\nsuggested in Sutra 27, or as a part of the highest Self as suggested in Sutra\n28--its real bondage cannot be done away with, and thus the scriptural\ndoctrine of final release becomes absurd.--Nor, finally, can it be said that\n_S_ ruti equally teaches difference and non-difference. For non-difference\nonly is what it aims at establishing; while, when engaged in setting forth\nsomething else, it merely refers to difference as something known from other\nsources of knowledge (viz. perception, &c.).--Hence the conclusion stands that\nthe soul is not different from the highest Self, as explained in Sutra 25.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 30](sbe38133.htm)\n\n'
