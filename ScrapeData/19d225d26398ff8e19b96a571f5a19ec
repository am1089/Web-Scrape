Not so; as there are parallel instances.\n\nThe teaching of the Vedanta-texts is not inappropriate, since there are\ninstances of good and bad qualities being separate in the case of one thing\nconnected with two\n\np. 422\n\ndifferent states. The 'but' in the Sutra indicates the impossibility of\nBrahman being connected with even a shadow of what is evil. The meaning is as\nfollows. As Brahman has all sentient and non-sentient things for its body, and\nconstitutes the Self of that body, there is nothing contrary to reason in\nBrahman being connected with two states, a causal and an effected one, the\nessential characteristics of which are expansion on the one hand and\ncontraction on the other; for this expansion and contraction belong (not to\nBrahman itself, but) to the sentient and non-sentient beings. The\nimperfections adhering to the body do not affect Brahman, and the good\nqualities belonging to the Self do not extend to the body; in the same way as\nyouth, childhood, and old age, which are attributes of embodied beings, such\nas gods or men, belong to the body only, not to the embodied Self; while\nknowledge, pleasure and so on belong to the conscious Self only, not to the\nbody. On this understanding there is no objection to expressions such as 'he\nis born as a god or as a man' and 'the same person is a child, and then a\nyouth, and then an old man' That the character of a god or man belongs to the\nindividual soul only in so far as it has a body, will be shown under III, 1,\n1.\n\nThe assertion made by the Purvapakshin as to the impossibility of the world,\ncomprising matter and souls and being either in its subtle or its gross\ncondition, standing to Brahman in the relation of a body, we declare to be the\nvain outcome of altogether vicious reasoning springing from the idle fancies\nof persons who have never fully considered the meaning of the whole body of\nVedanta-texts as supported by legitimate argumentation. For as a matter of\nfact all Vedanta-texts distinctly declare that the entire world, subtle or\ngross, material or spiritual, stands to the highest Self in the relation of a\nbody. Compare e.g.the antaryamin-brahma _n_ a, in the Ka _n_ va as well as the\nMadhyandina-text, where it is said first of non-sentient things ('he who\ndwells within the earth, whose body the earth is' &c.), and afterwards\nseparately of the intelligent soul ('he who dwells in understanding,'\naccording to the\n\np. 423\n\n[paragraph continues] Ka _n_ vas; 'he who dwells within the Self,' according\nto the Madhyandinas) that they constitute the body of the highest Self.\nSimilarly the Subala-Upanishad declares that matter and souls in all their\nstates constitute the body of the highest Self ('He who dwells within the\nearth' &c.), and concludes by saying that that Self is the soul of all those\nbeings ('He is the inner Self of all' &c.). Similarly Sm _ri_ ti, 'The whole\nworld is thy body'; 'Water is the body of Vish _n_ u'; 'All this is the body\nof Hari'; 'All these things are his body'; 'He having reflected sent forth\nfrom his body'--where the 'body' means the elements in their subtle state. In\nordinary language the word 'body' is not, like words such as _jar_ , limited\nin its denotation to things of one definite make or character, but is observed\nto be applied directly (not only secondarily or metaphorically) to things of\naltogether different make and characteristics--such as worms, insects, moths,\nsnakes, men, four-footed animals, and so on. We must therefore aim at giving a\ndefinition of the word that is in agreement with general use. The definitions\ngiven by the Purvapakshin--'a body is that which causes the enjoyment of the\nfruit of actions' &c.--do not fulfil this requirement; for they do not take in\nsuch things as earth and the like which the texts declare to be the body of\nthe Lord. And further they do not take in those bodily forms which the Lord\nassumes according to his wish, nor the bodily forms released souls may assume,\naccording to 'He is one' &c. ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 36, 2); for none of those\nembodiments subserve the fruition of the results of actions. And further, the\nbodily forms which the Supreme Person assumes at wish are not special\ncombinations of earth and the other elements; for Sm _ri_ ti says, 'The body\nof that highest Self is not made from a combination of the elements.' It thus\nappears that it is also too narrow a definition to say that a body is a\ncombination of the different elements. Again, to say that a body is that, the\nlife of which depends on the vital breath with its five modifications is also\ntoo narrow, viz in respect of plants; for although vital air is present in\nplants, it does not in them support the body by appearing\n\np. 424\n\nin five special forms. Nor again does it answer to define a body as either the\nabode of the sense-organs or as the cause of pleasure and pain; for neither of\nthese definitions takes in the bodies of stone or wood which were bestowed on\nAhalya and other persons in accordance with their deeds. We are thus led to\nadopt the following definition--Any substance which a sentient soul is capable\nof completely controlling and supporting for its own purposes, and which\nstands to the soul in an entirely subordinate relation, is the body of that\nsoul. In the case of bodies injured, paralysed, &c., control and so on are not\nactually perceived because the power of control, although existing, is\nobstructed; in the same way as, owing to some obstruction, the powers of fire,\nheat,and so on may not be actually perceived. A dead body again begins to\ndecay at the very moment in which the soul departs from it, and is actually\ndissolved shortly after; it (thus strictly speaking is not a body at all but)\nis spoken of as a body because it is a part of the aggregate of matter which\npreviously constituted a body. In this sense, then, all sentient and non-\nsentient beings together constitute the body of the Supreme Person, for they\nare completely controlled and supported by him for his own ends, and are\nabsolutely subordinate to him. Texts which speak of the highest Self as\n'bodiless among bodies' (e.g. Ka. Up. I. 2, 22), only mean to deny of the Self\na body due to karman; for as we have seen, Scripture declares that the\nUniverse is his body. This point will be fully established in subsequent\nadhikara _n_ as also. The two preceding Sutras (8 and 9) merely suggest the\nmatter proved in the adhikara _n_ a beginning with II, 1, 21.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 10.
