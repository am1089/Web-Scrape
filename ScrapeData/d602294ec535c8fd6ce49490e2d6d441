He draws the A _m_ _s_ u 1 (graha), just for completeness\' sake,\nfor it is [therefor](errata.htm#2) that he draws\n\np. 6\n\nthe A _m_ _s_ u. After that he draws those recognised Agnish _t_ oma cups 1 up\nto the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a.\n\n5:1:2:22, He then draws the P _ri_ sh _th_ yas 2: and whatever the gods (Agni,\nIndra, and Surya) won by them, even that he wins by them.\n\n5:1:2:33\\. He then draws the Sho _d_ a _s_ in: and whatever Indra won thereby,\neven that he (the sacrificer) wins thereby.\n\n5:1:2:44\\. He then draws those five Va _g_ apeya cups (for Indra; the first)\nwith the text (V. S. IX, 2), \'Thee, the firm-seated, the man-seated, the mind-\nseated! Thou art taken with a support 3: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This\nis thy womb\' (i.e. thy home): thee, most agreeable to Indra!\' therewith he\ndeposits it; for of these\n\np. 7\n\nworlds this one, to wit the earth, is the firm one: this same world he thereby\nwins.\n\n5:1:2:55\\. [The second with,] \'Thee, the water-seated, the ghee-seated, the\nether-seated! Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to Indra!\nThis is thy womb: thee most agreeable to Indra!\' therewith he deposits it; for\namong these worlds that ether (mentioned in the formula) is this air: he\nthereby wins this air-world.\n\n5:1:2:66\\. [The third with,] \'Thee, the earth-seated, the air-seated, the sky-\nseated, the god-seated, the heaven-seated! Thou art taken with a support: I\ntake thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to\nIndra!\' therewith he deposits it; for god-seated, heaven-seated indeed is\nyonder world of the gods: the world of the gods he thereby wins.\n\n5:1:2:77\\. [The fourth with V. S. IX, 3,] \'The waters\' invigorating essence,\nbeing contained in the sun,--that which is the essence of the waters\' essence,\nthat, the most excellent, I take for you! Thou art taken with a support: I\ntake thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to\nIndra!\' therewith he deposits it; for the waters\' essence is he that blows (or\npurifies) yonder (the wind), and he is contained in the sun, he blows from the\nsun: that same essence he thereby wins.\n\n5:1:2:88\\. [The fifth with IX, 4,] \'Ye cups, of strengthening libations,\ninspiring the sage with thought,--I have gathered together the pith and sap of\nyou, the handleless! Thou art taken with a support: thee, agreeable to Indra!\nThis is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to\n\np. 8\n\n[paragraph continues] Indra!\' therewith he deposits it;--pith means essence:\nit is the essence he thereby wins.\n\n5:1:2:99\\. These, then, are five Va _g_ apeya cups he draws; for he who offers\nthe Va _g_ apeya wins Pra _g_ apati; and Pra _g_ apati is the year, and there\nare five seasons in the year,--he thus wins Pra _g_ apati: therefore he draws\nfive Va _g_ apeya cups.\n\n5:1:2:1010\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then draws seventeen (other) cups of Soma, and\n(the Nesh _t_ _ri_ ) seventeen cups of Sura (spirituous liquor), for to Pra\n_g_ apati belong these two (saps of) plants, to wit the Soma and the\nSura;--and of these two the Soma is truth, prosperity, light; and the Sura\nuntruth, misery, darkness: both these (saps of) plants he thereby wins; for he\nwho offers the Va _g_ apeya wins everything here, since he wins Pra _g_ apati,\nand Pra _g_ apati indeed is everything here.\n\n5:1:2:1111\\. Now as to why he draws seventeen cups of Soma;--Pra _g_ apati is\nseventeenfold, Pra _g_ apati is the sacrifice 1: as great as the sacrifice is,\nas great as is\n\np. 9\n\nits measure, with that much he thus wins its truth, its prosperity, its light.\n\n5:1:2:1212\\. And why he draws seventeen cups of Sura;--Pra _g_ apati is\nseventeenfold, Pra _g_ apati is the sacrifice: as great as the sacrifice is,\nas great as is its measure, with that much he thus wins its untruth, its\nmisery, its darkness.\n\n5:1:2:1313\\. These two amount to thirty-four cups; for there are thirty-three\ngods, and Pra _g_ apati is the thirty-fourth: he thus wins Pra _g_ apati.\n\n5:1:2:1414\\. Now when he buys the king (Soma), he at the same time buys for a\npiece of lead the Parisrut (immature spirituous liquor) from a long-haired man\nnear by towards the south. For a long-haired man is neither man nor woman;\nfor, being a male, he is not a woman; and being long-haired (a eunuch), he is\nnot a man. And that lead is neither iron nor gold; and the Parisrut-liquor is\nneither Soma nor Sura 1: this is why he buys the Parisrut for a piece of lead\nfrom a long-haired man.\n\n5:1:2:1515\\. And on the preceding day they prepare two\n\np. 10\n\nearth-mounds 1, the one in front of the axle, and the other behind the axle:\n\'Lest we should deposit together the cups of Soma, and the cups of Sura,\'--\nthis is why, on the preceding day, they prepare two mounds, one in front, and\nthe other behind the axle.\n\n5:1:2:1616\\. Now, when they take the Vasativari water 2 (into the havirdhana\nshed) by the front door, the Nesh _t_ _ri_ takes in the Parisrut-liquor by the\nback door. From the south they bring in the drinking vessels. The Adhvaryu,\nseated in front of the axle, with his face towards the west, draws the cups of\nSoma; and the Nesh _t_ _ri_ , seated behind the axle, with his face towards\nthe east, draws the cups of Sura. The Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, the Nesh\n_t_ _ri_ a cup of Sura; the Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, the Nesh _t_ _ri_ a\ncup of Sura: in this way they draw them alternately.\n\n5:1:2:1717\\. Neither does the Adhvaryu hold the Soma-cup beyond the axle\ntowards the back, nor the Nesh _t_ _ri_ the Sura-cup beyond the axle towards\nthe front, thinking, \'Lest we should confound light and darkness!\'\n\n5:1:2:1818\\. The Adhvaryu holds the Soma-cup just over the axle, and the Nesh\n_t_ _ri_ the Sura-cup just below\n\np. 11\n\nthe axle, with (V. S. IX, 4), \'United ye are: unite me with happiness!\'\nThinking, \'Lest we should say "evil",\' they withdraw them again, with,\n\'Disunited ye are: disunite me from evil!\' Even as one might tear a single\nreed from a clump of reed-grass, so do they thereby tear him from out of all\nevil: there is not in him so much sin as the point of a grass-blade. They\ndeposit the two (cups each time on the mounds).\n\n5:1:2:1919\\. Thereupon the Adhvaryu draws the Madhu-graha (honey-cup) in a\ngolden vessel, and deposits it in the middle of the Soma-grahas. He then draws\nthe Ukthya, then the Dhruva. And when, at the last chant (of the evening press\nfeast 1), he has poured those Soma-grahas one by one into the cups of the\nofficiating priests, they make offering and drink them. At the midday-pressing\nit is told regarding the honey-cup, and the cups of Sura: thereof then 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[5:1](sbe4104.htm#fr_35) Regarding this cup, or libation (consisting, it would\nseem, of imperfectly pressed Soma-plants in water), see part ii, p. 424, note\n1. Here, and in the sequel, the author only refers to those points of\nceremonial in which the performance differs from that of the ordinary Agnish\n_t_ oma sacrifice, as described in part ii.\n\n[6:1](sbe4104.htm#fr_36) Viz. the Upa _m_ _s_ u and Antaryama; the\nAindravayava, Maitravaru _n_ a and \xc3\x82 _s_ vina; the _S_ ukra and Manthin; and\nthe \xc3\x82graya _n_ a. Part ii, pp. 256 seq.\n\n[6:2](sbe4104.htm#fr_37) That is, the three Atigrahyas (part ii, p. 402, note\n2), required for the P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotras at the midday feast, when\nperformed in their proper \'p _ri_ sh _th_ a\' form, as they are at the P _ri_\nsh _th_ ya sha _d_ aha, and at a Vi _s_ va _g_ it-ekaha with all the P _ri_ sh\n_th_ as. See IV, 5, 4, 24. The authorities of the Black Ya _g_ us adopt a\nsomewhat different arrangement. The Va _g_ apeya cups are likewise called by\nthem Atigrahyas (Taitt. S. I, 7, 22; T. B. I, 3, 9), and these are apparently\ndrawn by them immediately after the second of the ordinary three Atigrahyas,\nthe one belonging to Indra (T. S. vol. i, p. 996,--but see ib. p. 1955, where\nit is stated that they are drawn immediately after the \xc3\x82graya _n_ a,--that is,\nprobably, if the ordinary Atigrahyas are not required). Then follows (the\nthird ordinary Atigrahya?), then the Sho _d_ a _s_ in, and thereupon the\nseventeen cups for Pra _g_ apati.--Saya _n_ a remarks on our passage,--tesham\n(atigrahya _n_ am) prak _ri_ tigata tritvasa _m_ khyaiva _s_ akhantaravat sa\n_m_ khyantaranupade _s_ at. MS. I. O. 657.\n\n[6:3](sbe4104.htm#fr_38) For an explanation of these notions, see part ii, p.\n260, notes 1 and 2.\n\n[8:1](sbe4104.htm#fr_39) See I, 5, 2, 17, where the principal formulas used in\nmaking oblations are computed as consisting together of seventeen syllables.\nPa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_. Br. 18, 6 insists especially on the symbolic identity of Pra _g_\napati and the Va _g_ apeya on the double ground that the Va _g_ apeya consists\nof seventeen stotras, and has for its characteristic mode of chanting the\nSaptada _s_ a-stoma, or seventeen-versed hymn. That this is indeed so will\nappear from a glance at the chief chants. The Bahishpavamana-stotra, which in\nthe ordinary Agnish _t_ oma is chanted in the triv _ri_ t-stoma, consisting of\nthree triplets, or nine verses (see part ii, p. 310), is at the Va _g_ apeya\nmade to consist of seventeen verses, by the insertion of eight verses (S.V.\nII, 180-82; 186-90) between the second and third triplets. Again, the\nMadhyandina-pavamana, ordinarily chanted in fifteen verses (part ii, p. 333),\nhere consists of seventeen, viz. II, 105-7 (sung twice in two tunes = six\nverses); II, 663 (one verse); II, 663-4 (sung as triplet, in two tunes = six\nverses); [II, 663, in a different tune again](errata.htm#3) (one verse); II,\n821-23 p. 9 (three verses)--making together seventeen verses. Similarly, the\n\xc3\x82rbhava-pavamana (chanted at the Agnish _t_ oma also in the Saptada _s_\na-stoma, cf. part ii, p. 315; but here with modifications) consists of II,\n165-7 (sung twice in two tunes = six verses); II, 42, 44 (two verses); II,\n47-9 (in two tunes = six verses); [II, 720-22](errata.htm#4) (three\nverses)--making together seventeen verses. For the similarly constructed Va\n_g_ apeya hymn see page 11, note 1. See also La _t_ y. _S_ r. VIII, 11, 15\nseq., where the number of officiating priests, as well as that of the various\nsacrificial fees, is fixed at seventeen. Similarly, \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. IX, 9, 2-3\nsays that there are either to be seventeen dikshas, or the whole ceremony is\nto be performed in seventeen days.\n\n[9:1](sbe4104.htm#fr_40) According to Saya _n_ a, the difference between sura\nand parisrut would seem to be that the former beverage is prepared from mature\nshoots (of rice, &c.), and the latter from such as are not quite ripe.\n\n[10:1](sbe4104.htm#fr_41) The mounds (khara) thrown up in the havirdhana cart-\nshed, are used for placing the cups of Soma (and Sura) after they are drawn,\nuntil they are used for the libations. See the plan of the sacrificial ground\nat the end of part ii; only that on the present occasion there is to be a\nsecond mound, for the placing of the Sura-cups, under or just behind the axle\nof the southern Soma-cart (in the place where the Nara _s_ a _m_ sa cups to\nthe Fathers were temporarily deposited at the Agnish _t_ oma; see III, 6, 2,\n25 with note). On this occasion a small door is also made in the southern wall\nof the cart-shed, by breaking through the hurdle.\n\n[10:2](sbe4104.htm#fr_42) Part ii, p. 222 seq.\n\n[11:1](sbe4104.htm#fr_43) The last chant (at the evening feast) of the Va _g_\napeya sacrifice is the so-called Va _g_ apeya-saman, or B _ri_ hat-stotra\n(Samav. II, 975-7), chanted, to the B _ri_ hat tune, in the Saptada _s_\na-stoma; the three verses being, by repetitions, raised to the number of\nseventeen.--\'When he has poured . . . they offer it:\' this is apparently a\ncase of the absolute construction of the gerund in \'-ya,\' cf. Delbruck,\nAltindische Syntax, p. 108.\n\n[11:2](sbe4104.htm#fr_44) On these cups, or libations, see [V, I, 5,\n28](sbe4107.htm#5:1:5:28).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 1, 3.
