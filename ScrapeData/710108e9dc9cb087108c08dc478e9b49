Vyasa said :-- O mighty armed Kuru! What you have asked me just now, I\nalso asked the same thing to Narada, the lord of the Munis and he gave me the\nfollowing reply :-- O Vyasa! What shall I say to you on this point more than\nthis that a doubt occurred to me also in my former days. The question that you\nhave put to me today rose in my mind before; and I went to my father Brahma,\nof endless energy and asked to him thus :-- O Lord! O Father! Whence is this\nwhole Brahma _nd_ a born? Have You created it? Or is it Vi _sn_ u or\nMahes'vara? O all pervading soul! Who is there in this Brahma _nd_ a fit to be\nworshipped? O Lord of the world! Who is the top-most Lord ruling over\neverything? Kindly say. O Brahma _n_! I am plunged in this sea of Maya and\nperils; my heart is agitated with doubts; hence it is not appeased in any\nplace of pilgrimage ; or in thinking any Deva or in practising any Sadhan or\nin any other object. O Sinless one! Give me the answers duly and thus remove\nmy doubts. O Tormentor of foes! Unless the highest truth is not known, peace\nis not found. This heart, distracted in various ways, cannot rest fixed on one\nsubject. Whom am I to remember? Whom to worship? Where to go? Whom to praise?\nWho is the Supreme God this Universe? I do not understand these things. O\nSatyavati's son! Hearing these my serious queries, Brahma, the grand-Sire of\nbeings, replied to me as follows :-- O highly illustrious son! What more shall\nI say to you than this that even Vi _sn_ u is unable to answer your questions;\nso difficult are they indeed! O great intelligent one! Nobody that is attached\nto the world knows anything about this. Those who are unattached to this\nworld, who are free from any envy, __ these who are without desires and calm,\nthose highsouled ones know the secret of all this. In former days when all was\nwater, water everywhere and all things, moving and non-moving were destroyed,\nwhen five elements were sprung, then I was also born from the lotus navel of\nVi _sn_ u. Then not seeing Moon, Sun, trees, or mountains or anything and\nsitting on the centre (Kar _n_ ika) of the lotus thought thus :-- When I am\nborn in this great ocean of waters? Who has created me? Who is now my\nprotector?\n\n\n\np. 123\n\n\n\nAnd Who will be my Destroyer when this cycle ends? There is no earth\ndistinctly visible anywhere here; on what, then, this mass of water rests?\nLotus is termed Pankaja because it springs from mud and dirt; so unless there\nexists the earth underneath with mud and dirt, how this lotus will come out\nhere! Now let me try and find out where is the root of this lotus, where is\nthe mud and dirt? If this be found, then the earth will be also certainly\nthere. Thus thinking, I dived underneath the water and searched for one\nthousand years but could not find earth anywhere, when the celestial voice\nentered my ears \xc2\x93Practise tapasya (austerities).\xc2\x94 Hearing this celestial\nvoice, I sat on the lotus, my birth place, and practised tapasya for one\nthousand years.\n\n\n\n20-30. Next, the celestial voice came again \xc2\x93Create.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, I became\nquite confounded and began to think within myself \xc2\x93now what am I to create?\nWhat to do?\xc2\x94 After this, the two terrible Daityas Madhu and Kaitabha came to\nme and affrighted me saying \xc2\x93Fight with us.\xc2\x94 I became quite terrified and\nholding the stem of the lotus, I got down within the water. There I saw a\nwonderful person, sleeping on the Ananta serpent. He was of a deep blue colour\nlike a rain-cloud, wearing yellow clothes, four-armed, garlanded with forest\nflowers, and the Lord of this whole Universe. On the four arms of this Maha Vi\n_sn_ u there were conch-shells, disc, club, and lotus and other weapons. I saw\nthis Achyuta Puru _s_ a, sleeping on the Ananta serpent bed, motionless and\nunder the influence of Yoga Nidra. I then thought within myself \xc2\x93What am I to\ndo?\xc2\x94 Not being able to find out any other way, I recollected the Devi who was\nthen of the nature of sleep and began to praise Her. The auspicious Devi Yoga\nNidra, whose form could not be determined, immediately left the body of Vi\n_sn_ u and decorated with divine ornaments, began to shine in the air. After\nShe left the body of Vi _sn_ u, Vi _sn_ u immediately got up. And He fought\nterribly for five thousand years with the Danavas Madhu Kaitabha; then by the\ngrace of the Bhagavati, He extended His own thighs and then, on those thighs,\nHe slew the two demons. Where Vi _sn_ u and myself were standing, Rudra Deva\ncame also and joined with us. Then we three saw the beautiful Devi in the\ncelestial space.\n\n\n\n31-40. We three, then, commenced to chant hymns to Her and She gladdened our\nhearts by Her gracious look and said :-- \xc2\x93O Brahma! O Vi _sn_ u! O Rudra! The\ntwo great Daityas are slain. Now forsake your laziness and do your respective\nworks of creating, preserving, and destroying the Universe; create your own\nabodes, and live in happiness; create by your respective lordly powers, the\nfourfold beings.\xc2\x94 Hearing the Devi's gentle sweet words, we spoke :-- \xc2\x93O\nMother! There is no wide earth here; all is one mass of infinite ocean. No\nfive elements, no five tanmatras,\n\n\n\np. 124\n\n\n\nno sensual organs, no Gu _n_ as, nothing exist here; how can we then execute\nthe works of creation, etc. Hearing our words, the Devi smiled. Immediately\nthere came from the sky overhead a beautiful aerial car. The Devi said :-- \xc2\x93O\nBrahma! O Vi _sn_ u! O Rudra! Get in this car without any fear. To-day I will\nshow you one wonderful thing.\xc2\x94 At Her word, we got into the beautiful car\nwithout any fear. It was decorated with various gems and jewels, bedecked with\npearls, emitting sweet tinkling sounds of bells and looking as the abode of\nthe celestials. Seeing us seated without any fear, She made the car get high\nup in the sky by Her force.\n\n\n\nThus ends the second chapter of the third skandha on Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and\nRudra's going towards the heavens on the celestial car, given by the Devi in\nthe Mahapura _n_ a S'rimad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i\nVeda Vyas.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 3](bk03ch03.htm)\n\n"
