(It is) a mark indicating that the promissory statement is proved; thus \xc3\x82\n_s_ marathya thinks.\n\nAccording to the teacher \xc3\x82 _s_ marathya the circumstance that terms denoting\nthe individual soul are used to denote Brahman is a mark enabling us to infer\nthat the promissory declaration according to which through the knowledge of\none thing everything is known is well established. If the individual soul were\nnot identical with Brahman in so far as it is the effect of Brahman, then the\nknowledge of the soul--being something distinct from Brahman--would not follow\nfrom the knowledge of the highest Self. There are the texts declaring the\noneness of Brahman previous to creation, such as 'the Self only was this in\nthe beginning' (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 4, 1, 1), and on the other hand those texts which\ndeclare that the souls spring from and again are merged in Brahman; such as\n'As from a blazing fire sparks being like unto fire fly forth a thousandfold,\nthus are various beings brought forth from the Imperishable, and return\nthither also' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 1). These two sets of texts together make us\napprehend that the souls are one with Brahman in so far as they are its\neffects. On this ground a word denoting the individual soul denotes the\nhighest Self as well.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[391:1](sbe48161.htm#fr_35) If it be insisted upon that the Self in 'for the\ndesire of the Self' is the individual Self, we point out that terms denoting\nthe individual Self at the same time denote the highest Self also. This tenet\nof his Ramanu _g_ a considers to be set forth and legitimately proved in Sutra\n23, while Sutras 21 and 22 although advocating the right principle fail to\nassign valid arguments.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 21.
