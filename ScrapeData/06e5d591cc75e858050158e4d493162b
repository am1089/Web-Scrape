All the four texts are here embodied along\nwith their English translations, for convenient reference. The text of the\n_Manasollasa_ followed in the first Edition has been revised with the aid of\nthe Mss. of the Adyar Library; and this has rendered necessary some changes in\nthe text and the translation here and there. In other respects the second\nedition remains the same as the first.\n\nA. Mahadeva Sastri\n\n  ADYAR,  \n_September 1919_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Contents](dast03.htm)\n\n'
