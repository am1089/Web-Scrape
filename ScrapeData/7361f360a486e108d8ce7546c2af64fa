ALL this, whatsoever moves on earth, is to be hidden in the Lord (the\nSelf). When thou hast surrendered all this, then thou mayest enjoy. Do not\ncovet the wealth of any man!\n\n2\\. Though a man may wish to live a hundred years, performing works, it will\nbe thus with him; but not in any other way: work will thus not cling to a man.\n\n3\\. There are the worlds of the Asuras 1 covered with blind darkness. Those\nwho have destroyed their self (who perform works, without having arrived at a\nknowledge of the true Self ), go after death to those worlds.\n\n4\\. That one (the Self), though never stirring, is swifter than thought. The\nDevas (senses) never reached it, it walked 2 before them. Though standing\nstill, it overtakes the others who are running. Matarisvan (the wind, the\nmoving spirit) bestows powers 3 on it.\n\np. 312\n\n5\\. It stirs and it stirs not; it is far, and likewise near 1. It is inside of\nall this, and it is outside of all this.\n\n6\\. And he who beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings, he\nnever turns away from it 2.\n\n7\\. When to a man who understands, the Self has become all things, what\nsorrow, what trouble can there be to him who once beheld that unity?\n\n8\\. He 3 (the Self) encircled all, bright, incorporeal, scatheless, without\nmuscles, pure, untouched by evil; a seer, wise, omnipresent, self-existent, he\ndisposed all things rightly for eternal years.\n\n9\\. All who worship what is not real knowledge (good works), enter into blind\ndarkness: those who delight in real knowledge, enter, as it were, into greater\ndarkness.\n\n10\\. One thing, they say, is obtained from real knowledge; another, they say,\nfrom what is not knowledge. Thus we have heard from the wise who taught us\nthis 4.\n\n11\\. He who knows at the same time both knowledge and not-knowledge, overcomes\ndeath through not-knowledge, and obtains immortality through knowledge.\n\n12\\. All who worship what is not the true cause,\n\np. 313\n\nenter into blind darkness: those who delight in the true cause, enter, as it\nwere, into greater darkness.\n\n13\\. One thing, they say, is obtained from (knowledge of) the cause; another,\nthey say, from (knowledge of) what is not the cause. Thus we have heard from\nthe wise who taught us this.\n\n14\\. He who knows at the same time both the cause and the destruction (the\nperishable body), overcomes death by destruction (the perishable body), and\nobtains immortality through (knowledge of ) the true cause.\n\n15\\. The door of the True is covered with a golden disk 1. Open that, O\nPushan, that we may see the nature of the True 2.\n\n16\\. O Pushan, only seer, Yama (judge), Surya (sun), son of Pra _g_ apati,\nspread thy rays and gather them! The light which is thy fairest form, I see\nit. I am what He is (viz. the person in the sun) 3.\n\n17\\. Breath 4 to air, and to the immortal! Then this my body ends in ashes.\nOm! Mind, remember! Remember thy deeds! Mind, remember! Remember thy deeds 5!\n\n18\\. Agni, lead us on to wealth (beatitude) by a good path, thou, O God, who\nknowest all things!\n\np. 314\n\n[paragraph continues] Keep far from us crooked evil, and we shall offer thee\nthe fullest praise! (Rv. I, 189, 1.)\n\n________________________\n\nThis Upanishad, though apparently simple and intelligible, is in reality one\nof the most difficult to understand properly. Coming at the end of the Va _g_\nasaneyi-sa _m_ hita, in which the sacrifices and the hymns to be used by the\nofficiating priests have been described, it begins by declaring that all has\nto be surrendered to the Lord. The name is, lord, is peculiar, as having a far\nmore personal colouring than \xc3\x82tman, Self, or Brahman, the usual names given by\nthe Upanishads to what is the object of the highest knowledge.\n\nNext follows a permission to continue the performance of sacrifices, provided\nthat all desires have been surrendered. And here occurs our first difficulty,\nwhich has perplexed ancient as well as modern commentators.\n\nI shall try, first of all, to justify my own translation. I hold that the\nUpanishad wishes to teach the uselessness by themselves of all good works,\nwhether we call them sacrificial, legal, or moral, and yet, at the same time,\nto recognise, if not the necessity, at least the harmlessness of good works,\nprovided they are performed without any selfish motives, without any desire of\nreward, but simply as a preparation for higher knowledge, as a means, in fact,\nof subduing all passions, and producing that serenity of mind without which\nman is incapable of receiving the highest knowledge. From that point of view\nthe Upanishad may well say, Let a man wish to live here his appointed time,\nlet him even perform all works. If only he knows that all must be surrendered\nto the Lord, then the work done by him will not cling to him. It will not work\non and produce effect after effect, nor will it involve him in a succession of\nnew births in which to enjoy the reward of his works, but it will leave him\nfree to enjoy the blessings of the highest knowledge. It will have served as a\npreparation for that higher knowledge which the Upanishad imparts, and which\nsecures freedom from further births.\n\nThe expression 'na karma lipyate nare' seems to me to admit of this one\nexplanation only, viz. that work done does not cling to man, provided he has\nacquired the highest knowledge. Similar expressions occur again and again. Lip\nwas, no doubt, used originally of evil deeds which became, as it were,\nengrained in man; but afterwards of all work, even of good work, if done with\na desire of reward. The doctrine of the Upanishads is throughout that\northodoxy and sacrifice can procure a limited beatitude only,\n\np. 315\n\nand that they are a hindrance to real salvation, which can be obtained by\nknowledge alone. In our passage therefore we can recognise one meaning only,\nviz. that work does not cling to man or stain him, if only he knows, i. e. if\nhe has been enlightened by the Upanishad.\n\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, in his commentary on the Vedanta-sutras III, 4, 7; 13; 14, takes\nthe same view of this passage. The opponent of Badaraya _n_ a, in this case,\n_G_ aimini himself, maintains that karma, work, is indispensable to knowledge,\nand among other arguments, he says, III, 4, 7, that it is so 'Niyamat,'\n'Because it is so laid down by the law.' The passage here referred to is,\naccording to _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, our very verse, which, he thinks, should be\ntranslated as follows: 'Let a man wish to live a hundred years here (in this\nbody) performing works; thus will an evil deed not cling to thee, while thou\nart a man; there is no other way but this by which to escape the influence of\nworks.' In answer to this, Badaraya _n_ a says, first of all, III, 4, 13, that\nthis rule may refer to all men in general, and not to one who knows; or, III,\n4, 14, if it refers to a man who knows, that then the permission to perform\nworks is only intended to exalt the value of knowledge, the meaning being that\neven to a man who performs sacrifices all his life, work does not cling, if\nonly he knows;--such being the power of knowledge.\n\nThe same _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, however, who here sees quite clearly that this verse\nrefers to a man who knows, explains it in the Upanishad as referring to a man\nwho does not know (itarasyanatma _g_ \xc3\xb1atayatmagraha _n_ a _s_ aktasya). It\nwould then mean: 'Let such a one, while performing works here on earth, wish\nto live a hundred years. In this manner there is no other way for him but this\n(the performance of sacrifices), so that an evil deed should not be engrained,\nor so that he should not be stained by such a deed.' The first and second\nverses of the Upanishad would thus represent the two paths of life, that of\nknowledge and that of works. and the following verses would explain the\nrewards assigned to each.\n\nMahidhara, in his commentary on the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita, steers at\nfirst a middle course. He would translate: 'Let one who performs the Agnihotra\nand other sacrifices, without any desire of reward, wish to live here a\nhundred years. If thou do so, there will be salvation for thee, not otherwise.\nThere are many roads that, lead to heaven, but one only leading to salvation,\nnamely, performance of good works, without any desire of reward, which\nproduces a pure heart. Work thus done, merely as a preparation for salvation,\ndoes not cling to man, i.e. it produces a pure heart, but does not\n\np. 316\n\nentail any further consequences.' So far he agrees with Uva _t_ a's\nexplanation 1. He allows, however, another explanation also, so that the\nsecond line would convey the meaning: 'If a man lives thus (performing good\nworks), then there is no other way by which an evil deed should not be\nengrained; i.e. in order to escape the power of sin, he must all his life\nperform sacred acts.'\n\nNext follows a description of the lot of those who, immersed in works, have\nnot arrived at the highest knowledge, and have not recovered their true self\nin the Highest Self, or Brahman. That Brahman, though the name is not used\nhere, is then described, and salvation is promised to the man who beholds all\nthings in the Self and the Self in all things.\n\nThe verses 9-14 are again full of difficulty, not so much in themselves as in\ntheir relation to the general system of thought which prevails in the\nUpanishads, and forms the foundation of the Vedanta philosophy. The\ncommentators vary considerably in their interpretations. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains\navidya, not-knowledge, by good works, particularly sacrifice, performed with a\nhope of reward; vidya, or knowledge, by a knowledge of the gods, but not, as\nyet, of the highest Brahman. The former is generally supposed to lead the\nsacrificer to the pit _ri_ loka, the world of the fathers, from whence he\nreturns to a series of new births; the latter to the devaloka, the world of\nthe gods, from whence he may either proceed to Brahman, or enter upon a new\nround of existences. The question then arises, how in our passage the former\ncould be said to lead to blind darkness, the latter to still greater darkness.\nBut for that statement, I have no doubt that all the commentators would, as\nusual, have taken vidya for the knowledge of the Highest Brahman, and avidya\nfor orthodox belief in the gods and good works, the former securing\nimmortality in the sense of freedom from new births, while the reward of the\nlatter is blessedness in heaven for a limited period, but without freedom from\nnew births.\n\nThis antithesis between vidya and avidya seems to me so firmly established\nthat I cannot bring myself to surrender it here. Though this Upanishad has its\nown very peculiar character, yet its object is, after all, to impart a\nknowledge of the Highest Self, and not to inculcate merely a difference\nbetween faith in the ordinary gods and good works. It was distinctly said\nbefore (ver. 3), that those who have destroyed their self, i. e. who perform\nworks only,\n\np. 317\n\nand have not arrived at a knowledge of the true Self, go to the worlds of the\nAsuras, which are covered with blind darkness. If then the same blind darkness\nis said in verse 9 to be the lot of those who worship not-knowledge, this can\nonly mean those who have not discovered the true Self, but are satisfied with\nthe performance of good works. And if those who perform good works are opposed\nto others who delight in true knowledge, that knowledge can be the knowledge\nof the true Self only.\n\nThe difficulty therefore which has perplexed _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara is this, how, while\nthe orthodox believer is said to enter into blind darkness, the true disciple,\nwho has acquired a knowledge of the true Self, could be said to enter into\nstill greater darkness. While _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara in this case seems hardly to have\ncaught the drift of the Upanishad, Uva _t_ a and Mahidhara propose an\nexplanation which is far more satisfactory. They perceive that the chief\nstress must be laid on the words ubhaya _m_ saha, 'both together,' in verses\n11 and 14. The doctrine of certain Vedanta philosophers was that works, though\nthey cannot by themselves lead to salvation, are useful as a preparation for\nthe highest knowledge, and that those who imagine that they can attain the\nhighest knowledge without such previous preparation, are utterly mistaken.\nFrom this point of view therefore the author of the Upanishad might well say\nthat those who give themselves to what is not knowledge, i. e. to sacrificial\nand other good works, enter into darkness, but that those who delight\naltogether in knowledge, despising the previous discipline of works, deceive\nthemselves and enter into still greater darkness.\n\nThen follows the next verse, simply stating that, according to the teaching of\nwise people, the reward of knowledge is one thing, the reward of ignorance, i.\ne. trust in sacrifice, another. Here Mahidhara is right again by assigning the\npit _ri_ loka, the world of the fathers, as the reward of the ignorant; the\ndevaloka, the world of the gods, as the reward of the enlightened, provided\nthat from the world of the gods they pass on to the knowledge of the Highest\nSelf or Brahman.\n\nThe third verse contains the strongest confirmation of Mahidhara's view. Here\nit is laid down distinctly that he only who knows both together, both what is\ncalled ignorance and what is called knowledge, can be saved, because by good\nworks he overcomes death, here explained by natural works, and by knowledge he\nobtains the Immortal, here explained by oneness with the gods, the last step\nthat leads on to oneness with Brahman.\n\nUva _t_ a, who takes the same view of these verses, explains at once,\n\np. 318\n\nand even more boldly than Mahidhara 1, vidya, or knowledge, by brahmavi _g_\n\xc3\xb1ana, knowledge of Brahman, which by itself, and if not preceded by works,\nleads to even greater darkness than what is called ignorance, i. e. sacrifice\nand orthodoxy without knowledge.\n\nThe three corresponding verses, treating of sambhuti and asambhuti instead of\nvidya and avidya, stand first in the Va _g_ asaneyi-sa _m_ hita. They must\nnecessarily be explained in accordance with our explanation of the former\nverses, i. e. sambhuti must correspond to vidya, it must be meant for the true\ncause, i. e. for Brahman, while asambhuti must correspond with avidya, as a\nname of what is not real, but phenomenal only and perishable.\n\nMahidhara thinks that these verses refer to the Bauddhas, which can hardly be\nadmitted, unless we take Buddhist in a very general sense. Uva _t_ a puts the\nLokayatas in their place 2. It is curious also to observe that Mahidhara,\nfollowing Uva _t_ a, explains asambhuti at first by the denial of the\nresurrection of the body, while he takes sambhuti rightly for Brahman. I have\nchiefly followed Uva _t_ a's commentary, except in his first explanation of\nasambhuti, resurrection 3. In what follows Uva _t_ a explains sambhuti rightly\nby the only cause of the origin of the whole world, i. e. Brahman 4, while he\ntakes vina _s_ a, destruction, as a name of the perishable body 5.\n\n_S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara sees much more in these three verses than Uva _t_ a. He takes\nasambhuti as a name of Prakriti, the undeveloped cause, sambhuti as a name of\nthe phenomenal Brahman or Hira _n_ yagarbha. From a worship of the latter a\nman obtains supernatural powers, from devotion to the former, absorption in\nPrak _ri_ ti.\n\nMahidhara also takes a similar view, and he allows, like _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara, another\nreading, viz. sambhutim avina _s_ a _m_ ka, and avina _s_ ena m _ri_ tyum\ntirtva. In this case the sense would be: 'He who knows the worship both of the\ndeveloped and the undeveloped, overcomes\n\np. 319\n\ndeath, i. e. such evil as sin, passion, &c., through worship of the\nundeveloped, while he obtains through worship of the developed, i. e. of Hira\n_n_ yagarbha, immortality, absorption in Prak _ri_ ti.'\n\nAll these forced explanations to which the commentators have recourse, arise\nfrom the shifting views held by various authorities with regard to the value\nof works. Our Upanishad seems to me to propound the doctrine that works,\nthough in themselves useless, or even mischievous, if performed with a view to\nany present or future rewards, are necessary as a preparatory discipline. This\nis or was for a long time the orthodox view. Each man was required to pass\nthrough the a _s_ ramas, or stages of student and householder, before he was\nadmitted to the freedom of a Sannyasin. As on a ladder, no step was to be\nskipped. Those who attempted to do so, were considered to have broken the old\nlaw, and in some respects they may indeed be looked upon as the true\nprecursors of the Buddhists.\n\nNevertheless the opposite doctrine, that a man whose mind had become\nenlightened, might at once drop the fetters of the law, without performing all\nthe tedious duties of student and householder, had strong supporters too among\northodox philosophers. Cases of such rapid conversion occur in the ancient\ntraditions, and Badaraya _n_ a himself was obliged to admit the possibility of\nfreedom and salvation without works, though maintaining the superiority of the\nusual course, which led on gradually from works to enlightenment and salvation\n1. It was from an unwillingness to assent to the decided teaching of the \xc3\x8e _s_\na-upanishad that _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara attempted to explain vidya, knowledge, in a\nlimited sense, as knowledge of the gods, and not yet knowledge of Brahman. He\nwould not admit that knowledge without works could lead to darkness, and even\nto greater darkness than works without knowledge. Our Upanishad seems to have\ndreaded libertinism, knowledge without works, more even than ritualism, works\nwithout knowledge, and its true object was to show that orthodoxy and\nsacrifice, though useless in themselves, must always form the preparation for\nhigher enlightenment.\n\nHow misleading _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's explanation may prove, we can see from the\ntranslation of this Upanishad by Rammohun Roy. He followed _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara\nimplicitly, and this is the sense which he drew from the text:--\n\n49\\. Those observers of religious rites that perform only the worship of the\nsacred fire, and oblations to sages, to ancestors,\n\np. 320\n\nto men, and to other creatures, without regarding the worship of celestial\ngods, shall enter into the dark region: and those practisers of religious\nceremonies who habitually worship the celestial gods only, disregarding the\nworship of the sacred fire, and oblations to sages, to ancestors, to men, and\nto other creatures, shall enter into a region still darker than the former.\n\n'10. It is said that adoration of the celestial gods produces one consequence;\nand that the performance of the worship of sacred fire, and oblations to\nsages, to ancestors, to men, and to other creatures, produce another: thus\nhave we heard from learned men, who have distinctly explained the subject to\nus.\n\n'11. Of those observers of ceremonies whosoever, knowing that adoration of\ncelestial gods, as well as the worship of the sacred fire, and oblation to\nsages, to ancestors, to men, and to other creatures, should be observed alike\nby the same individual, performs them both, will, by means of the latter,\nsurmount the obstacles presented by natural temptations, and will attain the\nstate of the celestial gods through the practice of the former.\n\n'12. Those observers of religious rites who worship Prak _ri_ ti alone (Prak\n_ri_ ti or nature, who, though insensible, influenced by the Supreme Spirit,\noperates throughout the universe) shall enter into the dark region: and those\npractisers of religious ceremonies that are devoted to worship solely the\nprior operating sensitive particle, allegorically called Brahma, shall enter\ninto a region much more dark than the former.\n\n'13. It is said that one consequence may be attained by the worship of Brahma,\nand another by the adoration of Prak _ri_ ti. Thus have we heard from learned\nmen, who have distinctly explained the subject to us.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[311:1](sbe01243.htm#fr_765) Asury`a, Va _g_.
