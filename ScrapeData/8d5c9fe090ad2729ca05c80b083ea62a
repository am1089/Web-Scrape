Minor degrees of merit procure only leases of heavenly mansions\nterminable after periods proportioned to the fund which buys them. King Yayati\nwent to heaven and when his term expired was unceremoniously ejected, and\nthrown down to earth.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XIV.: Rama Summoned.](ry092.htm)\n\n"
