Who knows their birth? or who was of yore in the favour of the Maruts,\nwhen they harnessed the spotted deer [1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:1:1)?\n\n2\\. Who has heard them when they had mounted their chariots, how they went\nforth? For the sake of what liberal giver (Sudas) did they run, and their\ncomrades followed [1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:2:1), (as) streams of rain (filled)\nwith food?\n\n3\\. They themselves said to me when day by day [1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:3:1)\nthey came to the feast with their birds [2](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:3:2): they\n(the Maruts) are manly youths and blameless; seeing them, praise them thus;\n\n4\\. They who shine by themselves in their ornaments\n[1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:4:1), their daggers, their garlands, their golden\nchains, their rings, going [2](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:4:2) on their chariots and\non dry land.\n\n5\\. O Maruts, givers of quickening rain, I am made to rejoice, following after\nyour chariots, as after days [1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:5:1) going with rain.\n\n6\\. The bucket which the bounteous heroes shook down from heaven for their\nworshipper, that cloud they send [1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:6:1) along heaven and\nearth, and showers follow on the dry land.\n\n7\\. The rivers having pierced [1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:7:1) the air with a rush\nof water, went forth like milk-cows; when your spotted deer roll about\n[2](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:7:2) like horses that have hasted to the resting-place\non their road.\n\n8\\. Come hither, O Maruts, from heaven, from the sky, even from near\n[1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:8:1); do not go far away!\n\np. 320\n\n9\\. Let not the Rasa, the Anitabha, the Kubha, the Krumu, let not the Sindhu\ndelay you! Let not the marshy Sarayu prevent you! May your favour be with us\nalone!\n\n10\\. The showers come forth after the host of your chariots, after the\nterrible Marut-host of the ever-youthful heroes [1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:10:1).\n\n11\\. Let us then follow with our praises and our prayers each host of yours,\neach troop, each company [1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:11:1).\n\n12\\. To what well-born generous worshipper have the Maruts gone to-day on that\nmarch,\n\n13\\. On which you bring to kith and kin the never-failing seed of corn? Give\nus that for which we ask you, wealth and everlasting happiness!\n\n14\\. Let us safely pass through our revilers, leaving behind the unspeakable\nand the enemies. Let us be with you when in the morning\n[1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:14:1) you shower down health, wealth\n[2](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:14:2), water, and medicine, O Maruts!\n\n15\\. That mortal, O men, O Maruts, whom you protect, may well be always\nbeloved by the gods, and rich in valiant offspring. May we be such!\n\n16\\. Praise the liberal Maruts, and may they delight on the path of this man\nhere who praises them, like cows in fodder. When they go, call after them as\nfor old friends, praise them who love you, with your song!\n\np. 321\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to _S_ yava _s_ va \xc3\x82treya. Metre, 1, 5, 10, 11, 15 Kakubh; 2 B _ri_\nhati; 3 Anush _t_ ubh; 4 Pura-ush _n_ ih; 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 16 Satob _ri_ hati;\n8, 12 Gayatri. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV.; the sixth verse\nis found in TS. II, 4, 8, 1; MS. II, 4, 7; Ka _th_ aka XI, 9.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. Kilasi, as fem. of kilasa, does not occur again. It seems to have\nmeant spotted or marked with pocks, and would be intended for the p _r\ni_shatis. Does Kailasa come from the same source?\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. Kasmai sasru _h_ is much the same as kasmai adya su _g_ ataya \xe2\x80\xa6 pra\nyayu _h_ , in verse 12. We must then begin a new sentence, anu apaya _h_ ,\ntheir comrades after, namely sasru _h_. Thus we read in verse 10 tam ya _h_\n_s_ ardham \xe2\x80\xa6 anu pra yanti v _ri_ sh _t_ aya _h_ , where the streams of rain\nare represented as the followers of the Maruts. We might also translate in our\nsentence: For what liberal giver did their comrades, the streams of rain with\nfood follow after (the Maruts).\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. \xc3\x9apa dyubhi _h_ occurs again VIII, 40, 8, and seems to mean from day to\nday.\n\nNote 2. The birds of the Maruts, probably of the same character as the birds\nof the A _s_ vins.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. I translate a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ i by ornament in general, not by paint or\nointment,. though that may have been its original meaning.\n\nNote 2. On _s_ raya, see Pa _n_. III, 3, 24. Dhanvasu may possibly have been\nintended as governed by svabhanava _h_ , and not by _s_ raya\xc2\xb4 _h_ ; see,\nhowever, VIII, 33, 6. _s_ ma _s_ rushu _s_ rita _h_.\n\np. 322\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. On dya\xc2\xb4va _h_ , nom. plur., and rathan, acc. plur., compare Bergaigne,\nMelanges Renier, p. 88. The text is doubtful, and may be a corruption of v\n_ri_ sh _t_ i\xc2\xb4 _h_ dya\xc2\xb4va _h_ yati\xc2\xb4 _h_ iva.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. The Taittiriyas, TS. II, 4, 8, 1, read par _g_ anya _h_ ; the\nMaitreyas, pra par _g_ anya _h_ s _ri_ _g_ atam and yantu.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Tat _ri_ dana, as t _ri_ d occurs in the Veda in the Parasmaipada\nonly, may be intended for a passive, bored, dug out, tapped. One would,\nhowever, expect in that case an instrumental, marudbhi _h_ , by whom they were\nbrought forth.\n\nNote 2. The words vi yad vartanta enya\xcc\x83 _h_ have received various\nexplanations. Wilson translates: 'When the rivers rush in various directions.'\nSaya _n_ a admits also another meaning: 'When the rivers grow.' Ludwig\ntranslates: 'Sich verteilend gehn die schimmernden auszeinander.' Grassmann,\nvery boldly: 'Wie Hengste traufelnd, wenn vom Wege heimgekehrt, sie zu den\nbunten Stuten gehn.' Vi-v _ri_ t seems, however, to have a very special\nmeaning, namely, rolling on the ground, and this the spotted deer are here\nsaid to have done, like horses at the end of their journey. We read of the\nsacrificial horse, _S_ at. Br. XIII, 5, 1, 16. sa yady ava va _g_ ighred vi va\nvarteta, sam _ri_ ddho me ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a iti ha vidyat; cf. XI, 2, 5, 3. In the\nTS. VII, I, 19, 3, the commentator explains vivartanam by nirgatya bhumau vilu\n_n_ _th_ anam, the rolling on the ground. The same meaning is applicable to\nMahaparinibbana Sutta, p. 66 (Childers), where the Bhikkhus are said to roll\non the ground when they hear of Buddha's death; also to Mahabh. III, 11953 (of\na wild boar). The meaning therefore in our passage seems to be, when the deer\nroll on the ground, as horses are wont to do at the end of a journey.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. Ama\xc2\xb4t corresponds here to p _ri_ thivi in other places. Originally it\nmay have meant from the home.\n\np. 323\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nThis verse has often been discussed on account of the names of the rivers\nwhich it contains. _S_ yava _s_ va had mentioned the Yamuna in 52, 17, and\nsome interpreters have been inclined to give to parush _n_ i in 52, 9 a\ngeographical meaning, taking it for the river Ravi, instead of translating it\nby cloud. The geographical names are certainly interesting, but they have been\ndiscussed so often that I need not dwell on them here. (See M. M., India. p.\n163.)\n\nThe Rasa, known to the Zoroastrians as the Ra _n_ ha, was originally the name\nof a real river, but when the \xc3\x82ryas moved away from it into the Punjab, it\nassumed a mythical character, and became a kind of Okeanos, surrounding the\nextreme limits of the world.\n\nAnitabha seems to be the name of a new river or part of a river. It can hardly\nbe taken as an epithet of Rasa, as Ludwig suggests. Anitabha, whose splendour\nhas not departed (Ludwig), or, amitabha, of endless splendour, would hardly be\nVedic formations. (Chips, I, p. 157; Hibbert Lect., p. 207; India, pp. 166,\n173, notes.)\n\nKubha is the \xce\x9a\xcf\x89\xcf\x86\xe1\xbd\xb5\xce\xbd or \xce\x9a\xcf\x89\xcf\x86\xe1\xbd\xb5\xcf\x82 of the Greeks, the Kabul river. The Krumu I take\nto be the Kurrum. (India, p. 177, note.)\n\nThe Sindhu is the Indus, though it is difficult to say which part of it, while\nthe Sarayu has been supposed to be the Sarayu, the affluent of the Ga\xe1\xb9\x85ga, but\nmay also be a more general name for some more northern river in the Punjab.\n(See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, pp. 17 f., 45; Muir, S. T. II, p. xxv, note.)\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Navyasinam has been a puzzle to all interpreters. Saya _n_ a seems to\nme to give the right interpretation, namely, nutananam. As from a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ asa,\ninstr. sing., straightway, a _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ asi\xc2\xb4na was formed, straightforward; from\nnavyasa, instr. sing., anew, navyasina seems to have been formed in the sense\nof new. Navyasinam might then be a somewhat\n\np. 324\n\nirregular gen. plur., referring to ga _n_ am ma\xc2\xb4rutam, the Marut-host of the\nyoung men; see V, 58, 1. Lanman (p. 515) takes it for a gen. plur. fem., but\nin that case it could not refer to rathanam. Zimmer translates endlos,\nBergaigne (II, 400) thinks of new or rejuvenescent mothers.\n\n##### Verse 11.\n\nNote 1. See III, 26, 6.\n\n##### Verse 14.\n\nNote 1. Usri, in the morning. Lanman (p. 427) proposes to read ushari, but the\nmetre would be better preserved by reading v _ri_ sh _t_ vi\xc2\xb4 as trisyllabic.\nThe difficulty is the construction of the gerund v _ri_ sh _t_ vi\xc2\xb4, which\nrefers to the Maruts, and sya\xc2\xb4ma saha, which refers to the sacrificers.\n\nNote 2. On sam yo _h_ , see I, 165, 4, note 2.\n\nThe metrical structure of this hymn is interesting. If we represent the foot\nof eight syllables by a, that of twelve by b, we find the following\nsuccession:\n\nI\n\n|\n\n1\n\n|\n\na b a\n\n|\n\nII\n\n|\n\n3\n\n|\n\na a a a\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n2\n\n|\n\na a b a\n\n|\n\n4\n\n|\n\nb a a\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nIII\n\n|\n\n5\n\n|\n\na a a\n\n|\n\nIV\n\n|\n\n8\n\n|\n\na a a\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n6\n\n|\n\nb a b a\n\n|\n\n9\n\n|\n\nb a b a\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n7\n\n|\n\nb a b a\n\n|\n\nVI\n\n|\n\n12\n\n|\n\na a a\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n  \n  \nV\n\n|\n\n10\n\n|\n\na b a\n\n|\n\n13\n\n|\n\nb a b a\n\n|\n\nVII\n\n|\n\n15\n\n|\n\na b a  \n  \n11\n\n|\n\na b a\n\n|\n\n14\n\n|\n\nb a b a\n\n|\n\n16\n\n|\n\nb a b a  \n  \nWe find that I contains the question, II the answer, III description of rain,\nIV prayer and invitation, V praise of the companions, VI prayer, VII\nconclusion.
