VI\n\n### TO THE KUNDALINI--THE MOTHER OF THE UNIVERSE.\n\n  "What Yogis now, what Rishis of old,  \nThe greatness of that Mother hath told,  \nWho from her own breast gave birth  \nTo the sky and to the earth.\n\n  Thou hung the Heavens in empty space,  \nAnd holds the earth in its place,  \nThou made and lighted up the sun  \nTo stay and shine this earth upon.\n\n  Thy power transcendent, since their birth  \nAsunder holds the heaven and earth,  \nAs chariot wheels are kept apart  \nBy axles made thru workman\'s art.\n\n  In Shakti, who with thee can vie,  \nThou fills the earth, the air, the sky;  \nThy presence, unperceived, extends  \nBeyond the world\'s remotest ends.\n\n  A million earths, if such there be,  \nA million skies fall short of thee;  \nA billion suns can not out shine  \nThe effulgence of thy light divine.\n\n  The worlds, which mortals boundless deem  \nTo thee but as a handfull seem.  \nMother, Thou art without a peer.  \nOn earth, or in yonder heavenly sphere. p. VII\n\n  Thee, God, such matchless powers adorn  \nThat thou without a foe was born.  \nThou art the Lord of Lords,  \nAdored by Men--[revered](errata.htm#0) by Gods.\n\n  The circling times which wear away,  \nAll else, to thee can not decay;  \nThou shinest on in youthful force,  \nWhile countless Yugas run their course.\n\n  Unvexed by cares, or fears, or strife,  \nIn bliss serene flow on thy life,  \nWith faith we claim thine aid divine,  \nAs thou art Mother, and we are thine.\n\nAn old Hindu prayer. The metrical translation from the Sanskrit writers, by\nMr. J. Muir, with modifications by author.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMy sincere thanks to every author and publisher, here quoted in my book and I\nalso want to add my thanks to Irene Ward, Grace Curtis and Clare McKinney for\ntheir unceasing efforts to help me bring it out in three weeks.\n\np. VIII\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf all great men were good and all good men would write a book this world\nwould be made better by their activities.\n\nRishi Gherwal\'s books are observations of nature and nature is God\'s "Master-\npiece". They are historical records of true facts of the Hindu books on\nphilosophy, and are like a visit to that old ancient Temple of Mathra.\n\nHis manner of teaching and writing inspires us with the knowledge of\nourselves, to be the same as the Universal Brotherhood--, Self of the\nUniverse, with God\'s poise and sense of mastery.\n\nHis books give us the blessed assurance that we no longer need to travel to\nget wisdom. Study TRUTH and absorb its teachings, and the world will come to\nyou, as it has to him.\n\nMay Peace be Unto him, together with a benediction of love, with our\nblessings.\n\nDr. and Mrs. J. D. Ward.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Introduction](kmu03.htm)\n\n'
