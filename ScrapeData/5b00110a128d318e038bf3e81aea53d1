But having destroyed by fruition the other two sets he becomes one with\nBrahman.\n\nThere now arises the doubt whether the good and evil\n\np. 727\n\nworks other than those the non-clinging and destruction of which have been\ndeclared, that is to say those works the results of which have begun to act,\ncome to an end together with that bodily existence in which knowledge of\nBrahman originates, or with the last body due to the action of the works last\nmentioned, or with another body due to the action of the anarabdhakarya.--The\nsecond of these alternatives is the one to be accepted, for there is a text\ndeclaring that works come to an end with the deliverance of the Self from the\ncurrent bodily existence: 'For him there is delay so long as he is not\ndelivered (from the body), then he will become one with Brahman' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVI, 14, 2).--This view the Sutra sets aside. Having destroyed the other good\nand evil works the results of which had begun to operate by retributive\nexperience he, subsequently to the termination of such retributive enjoyment,\nbecomes one with Brahman. If those good and evil works are such that their\nfruits may be fully enjoyed within the term of one bodily existence, they come\nto an end together with the current bodily existence; if they require several\nbodily existences for the full experience of their results, they come to an\nend after several existences only. This being so, the deliverance spoken of in\nthe text quoted by the Purvapakshin means deliverance from those works when\ncompletely destroyed by retributive enjoyment, not deliverance from bodily\nexistence about which the text says nothing. All those works, on the other\nhand, good and evil, which were performed before the rise of knowledge and the\nresults of which have not yet begun to operate--works which have gradually\naccumulated in the course of infinite time so as to constitute an infinite\nquantity--are at once destroyed by the might of the rising knowledge of\nBrahman. And works performed subsequently to the rise of such knowledge do not\n'cling.' And, as Scripture teaches, the friends of the man possessing true\nknowledge take over, on his death, his good works, and his enemies his evil\ndeeds. Thus there remains no contradiction.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_\na of 'the destruction of the others.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Second Pada: 1. Speech with mind...](sbe48517.htm)\n\n"
