[47](sbe1208.htm#page_47), par. 1. The Taitt. S. (II, 6, 6) has a somewhat\ndifferent version of this legend:--Agni had three elder brothers. While\ncarrying the oblations to the gods, they perished. Agni was afraid, \'In like\nmanner this one will meet with destruction (artim arishyati).\' He concealed\nhimself. He entered the waters. The gods wished to find him. A fish betrayed\nhim. He cursed it, \'May (people) kill thee by whatever means they can devise\n(dhiya-dhiya), who hast betrayed me!\' Hence they kill the fish by whatever\nmeans they can devise, for he is accursed. They found him, and said to him,\n\'Come back to us and carry our oblation!\' He said, \'I will ask a boon:\nwhatever portion of the taken (ghee) shall fall outside the enclosing-sticks,\nbefore it is offered, that shall be my brothers\' portion!\' Hence whatever\nportion of the taken (ghee) falls outside the enclosing-sticks, that is their\nportion: with that he satisfies them.\n\nP. [47](sbe1208.htm#page_47), par. 2. The Ka _n_ va text reads,--\'They\nfollowed Indra even as now-a-days also a Brahman follows a Kshatriya blessing\nhim (asa _m_ samano \'nu _k_ arati).\'\n\nP.

Professor Delbruck, Syntaktische\nForschungen II, p. 118, translates, \'And from the mouth which had been\ndrinking sura, the sparrow sprang: hence the latter sings so merrily, for\nindeed he sings so merrily as if it had drank sura.\' Differently, however,\nibid. III, p. 64.\n\nP. [175](sbe1228.htm#page_175), par. 1. Compare also the corresponding legend\nin Taitt. Br. I, 6, 7, 4:--Indra, having slain V _ri_ tra, went to the\nfarthest distance, thinking \'I have committed a sin (aparadham, ? I have\nmissed him).\' He said, \'Who will find this out?\' The Maruts said, \'We will\nchoose a boon, then we shall know: let the first offering be made to us!\' They\nsported on him (V _ri_ tra), &c. (According to Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. S. I, 8,\n4, Indra flees from fear and says, within the Marut\'s hearing, \'Is V _ri_ tra\ndead or not? Who will go near him and find it out?\' &c.)\n\nP. [183](sbe1230.htm#page_183), par. 1. According to Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. Br.\nI, 1, 3, 10, it was the Soma-plant (soma-valli) that was carried off by\nGayatri devata, and one of its leaves (par _n_ a) was broken off, and on\nfalling to the ground became a pala _s_ a tree. See also Taitt. S. VI, 1, 6;\n_S_ at. Br. III, 2, 4, 1 seq.; Weber, Ind. Stud. II, 312 seq.\n\nP. [184](sbe1230.htm#page_184), note [4](sbe1230.htm#fn_425). Add,--Compare\nMax Muller, Hist. of Anc.

On the etymology\nof nakshatra, see also Max Muller, Rig-veda-Sa _m_ hita IV, p. lxvi note.\n\nP. [310](sbe1245.htm#page_310), pars. 8-9.

The paragraph should have been\nrendered thus:--To Aru _n_ a Aupave _s_ i his kinsmen said, \'Thou art advanced\nin years: establish thou the fires!\' He replied, \'Thereby ye tell me, "keep\nsilence!" he who has established his fires must not speak an untruth, and only\nby not speaking at all one speaks no untruth: to that extent the service (of\nthe consecrated fire) consists in truth.\' Similarly the Ka _n_ va text,--aru\n_n_ a _m_ haupave _s_ i _m_ _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ataya u _k_ u _k_ sthaviro va asy agni\nadhatsveti.--sa hova _k_ a tan maitad brutha va _k_ a _m_ yama evaidhiti ma\nbrutheti na by agni adhaya m _ri_ sha vaden no va _k_ a vadato \'m _ri_ shodyam\nasti tasmad u satyam eva vivadishet. See Delbruck, Syntaktische Forschungen\nIII, p. 29.\n\nP. [368](sbe1253.htm#page_368), par. 24. Read,--He (the Sacrificer) then pulls\ndown the tuck of his nether garment) and performs obeisance. Cf.
