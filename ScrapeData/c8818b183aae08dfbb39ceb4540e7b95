Tradition declares him to be, and common belief accepts him as, an\nappearance of Vishnu himself, and not the incarnation of a portion of his\nessence. There is, however, considerable reason\n\np. 249\n\nfor doubting whether originally Jagann\xc4\x81th--the Lord of the World--had any\nconnection with Vishnu. It is possible that he was the local divinity of some\nnow unknown tribe, whose worship was engrafted into Hinduism; and the new god,\nwhen admitted into the Pantheon, was regarded as another manifestation of\nVishnu; or what is more probable, as Puri was a head centre of Buddhism, when\nthat system was placed under a ban and its followers persecuted, the temple\nwas\n\n[![JAGANN\xc4\x80TH.](tn/24900.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/24900.jpg)  \nJAGANN\xc4\x80TH.  \n\nutilized for Hinduism, and Jagann\xc4\x81th, nominally a Hindu deity, was really\nBuddhistic; the strange, unfinished image being nothing else than a disguised\nform of the symbols of the central doctrine of the Buddhist faith. Possibly,\nin order to be free from persecution, it was taught that this was a form of\nVishnu. There are several legends professing to account for the form in which\nhe is worshipped, and for the peculiar sanctity of Puri, the chief place of\nhis worship.\n\np. 250\n\n[paragraph continues] There is a peculiarity in, the phraseology employed by\nthe people who visit his shrine: they speak of going to see Jagann\xc4\x81th, not to\nworship him as is the case with other gods; and it is the sight of the image\nin the temple, or as it is being bathed, or drawn in its ponderous car, that\nis so eagerly desired as a means by which sin in the worshipper is destroyed.\n\nProfessor Goldstucker * gives the following legend from the Ain-i-Akbari, in\nwhich some of the ordinary notions of the people respecting Jagann\xc4\x81th are\ndescribed. A king desirous of founding a city sent a learned Br\xc4\x81hman to select\na proper site. The Br\xc4\x81hman after a long search reached the seashore, and there\nsaw a crow diving into the water, which, having washed its body, made\nobeisance to the sea. Understanding the language of birds, he learned from the\ncrow that if he remained there a short time, he would comprehend the wonders\nof the land. The king, apprised of this occurrence, built a large city and\ntemple on the spot near where the crow had appeared. One night the R\xc4\x81ja in a\ndream heard a voice saying to him: "On a certain day cast thine eyes on the\nseashore, when there will arise from the water a piece of wood 52 in. long and\n18 in. broad: this is the true form of the deity; take it up and keep it\nhidden in thine house seven days, and in whatever shape it shall then appear,\nplace it in the temple and worship it." The R\xc4\x81ja acted upon the advice given\nin his dream; and, when he had set up the image received from the sea, called\nit Jagann\xc4\x81th, the Lord of the World, and it became the object of worship of\nall ranks of people.\n\nWard \xe2\x80\xa0 gives a somewhat fuller account. When Krishna was accidentally shot by\nthe hunter Jara, his\n\np. 251\n\nbones were left to rot under the tree where he died, until some pious person\ncollected and placed them in a box. * There they remained, until Indradhumna,\na king who was earnestly striving to propitiate Vishnu, was directed to form\nan image, and place in it these bones, with the assurance that he would\nafterwards obtain a rich reward for his religious deeds. Indradhumna wishing\nto follow this advice, prayed to Visvakarma to assist him by making the image.\nThe architect of the gods consented to do this, but was most careful in\nexplaining to the king that if any one looked at him, or in any way disturbed\nhim whilst he was at work, he would immediately desist, and leave the image in\nan unfinished state. The king promised to observe this condition, and\nVisvakarma commenced his work. In one night he raised a grand temple in the\nblue mountains of Orissa, and then began to make the image. For fifteen days\nthe king managed, with difficulty, to restrain his impatience, but then\nfoolishly tried to see the god at work. The angry deity at once ceased, as he\nhad threatened, and the image was left with a most ugly face, and with- out\nhands or feet. The king, exceedingly grieved as he saw the result of his\ncuriosity, went in his distress to Brahm\xc4\x81, who comforted him with the promise\nthat he would render the image famous in its present form. The king invited\nthe gods to be present at its inauguration.\n\np. 252\n\n[paragraph continues] Several accepted the invitation, Brahm\xc4\x81 himself\nofficiated as priest, and gave eyes and a soul to the god. Thus the fame of\nJagann\xc4\x81th was completely established. The original image of this deity is\nclosely copied in other places besides Puri; and by his side there is\ngenerally an image of Krishna\'s favourite brother Balar\xc4\x81ma, and his sister\nSubhadr\xc4\x81.\n\nThe following is translated from a Bengali account of Jagann\xc4\x81th:--N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana\n(Vishnu) and his wife having taken up their abode in the blue mountains of\nOrissa, where he was known by the name of Nilm\xc4\x81dhava, was visited by great\nnumbers of gods and men, and the neighbourhood obtained the name of\nMokshyakhettra (the field of emancipation from births). A king named\nIndradhumna, a son of the Sun, a devout worshipper of Vishnu, being anxious to\npay a visit to Nilm\xc4\x81dhava, before starting, sent Vidyapati, the brother of his\nfamily priest, to learn the way to Orissa, that he might act as guide. On his\nreturn he gave such an account of all he had seen, that the king was more\nanxious to go than ever. Having made his arrangements, taking his family with\nhim, the king went under the guidance of Vidapati, but, on his arrival there,\nwas most grievously disappointed to learn that the god had withdrawn himself\nfrom the public gaze. As he cried with sorrow and vexation, a voice from the\nsky reached his ear: "As you cannot see Nilm\xc4\x81dhava, make a wooden image and\nworship that; N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana will inhabit it, and by the sight of the image you and\nothers will obtain final emancipation." The king followed this advice. As he\nwas preparing to make the image, N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81yana himself, in the form of an old\nBr\xc4\x81hman named Visvakarma, came and offered to form the image in fifteen days.\nThe offer was accepted, and within the specified time\n\np. 253\n\nthe image of Jagann\xc4\x81th, with those of his brother and sister, was made.\n\nThe peculiarity of the worship of Jagann\xc4\x81th is that his image is not only\nworshipped in its proper temple but on three days of the year is exposed to\npublic view. On the first of these days, called the Sn\xc4\x81n J\xc4\x81ttra (Bathing\nFestival), the idol is taken from its shrine, and on a lofty platform, in\nsight of vast multitudes, bathed by the priests. This exposure is supposed to\nbe productive of a cold, so that, ten days after, the Rath J\xc4\x81ttra (Car\nFestival) is held; at this time the image is placed on an immense car made\nexpressly for the purpose, and taken to the temple of another god for a change\nof air. The car is drawn by the excited crowd; the poorer and more ignorant\npeople believing it to be a meritorious act to assist in dragging it. After\nremaining for a few days, the third festival (the Return) is held, at which,\nwith somewhat diminished fervour, the idol is dragged back to its home. Puri\nis the place where it is believed the deity is seen with greater benefit to\nthe worshippers; but it is considered that there is considerable religious\nmerit obtained by seeing, and assisting to draw, his car in places nearer\nhome. Every town and almost every large village has its festival of this god;\nand with the promise of so desirable a gift--salvation from sin--it is not to\nbe wondered at that there should be a great wish to see him.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[250:*](hmvp30.htm#fr_227) Chambers\'s Cyclopaedia, _s.v._\n\n[250:\xe2\x80\xa0](hmvp30.htm#fr_228) Vol. ii. 163.\n\n[251:*](hmvp30.htm#fr_229) What appears far more likely is that some valued\nrelics of Buddha were placed in the image, but as it was dangerous at that\ntime to avow any connection with him and his worship, these relics were said\nto be the bones of Krishna. To touch a dead body, according to Hinduism, is\npollution; it seems, therefore, altogether opposed to the spirit of Hinduism\nto enshrine a bone in an image. Only by some such fiction could the relics of\nBuddha be saved. There is much in the rites at Puri to countenance the idea\nthat though professedly Hindu it is really a Buddhist shrine.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chaitanya](hmvp31.htm)\n\n'
