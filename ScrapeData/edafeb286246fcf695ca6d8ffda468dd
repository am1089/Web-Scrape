If it be said that this is not so, on account of the inferential marks of\nthe individual soul and the chief vital air; we reply that that has already\nbeen explained.\n\np. 272\n\nIt remains for us to refute the objection that on account of the inferential\nmarks of the individual soul and the chief vital air, which are met with in\nthe complementary passage, either the one or the other must be meant in the\npassage under discussion, and not the highest Lord.--We therefore remark that\nthat objection has already been disposed of under I, 1, 31. There it was shown\nthat from an interpretation similar to the one here proposed by the\npurvapakshin there would result a threefold meditation one having Brahman for\nits object, a second one directed on the individual soul, and a third one\nconnected with the chief vital air. Now the same result would present itself\nin our case, and that would be unacceptable as we must infer from the\nintroductory as well as the concluding clauses, that the passage under\ndiscussion refers to Brahman. With reference to the introductory clause this\nhas been already proved; that the concluding passage also refers to Brahman,\nwe infer from the fact of there being stated in it a pre-eminently high\nreward, 'Warding off all evil he who knows this obtains pre-eminence among all\nbeings, sovereignty, supremacy.'--But if this is so, the sense of the passage\nunder discussion is already settled by the discussion of the passage about\nPratarda _n_ a (I, 1, 31); why, then, the present Sutra?--No, we reply; the\nsense of our passage is not yet settled, since under I, 1, 31 it has not been\nproved that the clause, 'Or he whose work is this,' refers to Brahman. Hence\nthere arises again, in connexion with the present passage, a doubt whether the\nindividual soul and the chief vital air may not be meant, and that doubt has\nagain to be refuted.--The word pra _n_ a occurs, moreover, in the sense of\nBrahman, so in the passage, 'The mind settles down on pra _n_ a' ( _Kh_. Up.\nVI, 8, 2).--The inferential marks of the individual soul also have, on account\nof the introductory and concluding clauses referring to Brahman, to be\nexplained so as not to give rise to any discrepancy.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 4, 18](sbe34129.htm)\n\n"
