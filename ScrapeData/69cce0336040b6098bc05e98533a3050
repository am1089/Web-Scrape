The Ri _s_ is said :-- \xc2\x93O Suta! Who is that King Pururava? and who is\nthe Deva girl Urvas'i? And how did that high-souled King Pururava come into\ntrouble? O son of Lomahar _s_ a _n_ a! Kindly describe now all these to me. We\nare now desirous to hear sweet words from the lotus of your mouth. O Suta!\nYour words are sweeter and more full of juice than nectar even; so we are not\nsatiated by hearing them as gods are not satiated with the drink of nectar.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHearing this Suta said :-- O Munis! I am now telling you, as far as my\nintelligence goes, what I heard from the mouth of S'ri Vyasa. Now hear that\nbeautiful divine incident.\n\n\n\nOnce on a time the exceedingly beautiful dear wife of Brihaspati, named Tara,\nfull of youth and beauty, of the most beautiful limbs and intoxicated with\npride went to the house of Chandra Deva (the Moon), the yajaman (Employer of\npriest Brihaspati at any sacrifice) of Brihaspati. Seeing Tara of beautiful\nface like Moon, the Moon became very passionate; Tara also fell amorous at the\nsight of Moon. Thus both of them became very much passionately attached to\neach other. Then they, the Moon and Tara, being smitten by the arrows of Cupid\nand intoxicated with amorous passions began their sexual intercourse with\nreciprocal feelings of passionate love. Some days passed in this state.\nBrihaspati, then, being distressed with the pang of separation from his wife,\nsent his pupil to bring back Tara; but Tara was then submissive of Chandra and\ntherefore refused to come. Brihaspati sent over and over again his pupil and\nwhen Chandra Deva returned the messenger, Brihaspati became very angry and\nwent personally to Chandra's house and spoke angrily to the Moon who was\npuffed up with arrogance and somewhat smiling :-- \xc2\x93O Moon! Why are you\ncommitting this vicious act, contrary to Dharma? Why are you keeping my\nbeautiful wife in your house? I am your Guru; you are my client; O stupid! why\nare you enjoying your Guru's wife and keeping her in custody in your house? Do\nyou not know that he who kills a Brahman, who steals gold, who drinks, who\ngoes to wife of one's Guru are Mahapatakis (great sinners) and those who keep\ncompany of these are the fifth Mahapatakis? Therefore if you had enjoyed my\nwife, you are exceedingly vicious, blameable and a Mahapataki (great sinner);\nyou are not fit to live amongst the Devas. O wicked\n\n\n\np. 37\n\n\n\none! Now I say that even now you better forsake Tara, who is of a blue colour\nand whose look is askance; I won't go from here without having Tara. And if\nyou do not give back Tara, then you are certainly with her and undoubtedly I\nwill curse you. When Brihaspati said so, Chandra, the husband of Rohi _n_ i,\nspoke to his Guru Deva, who was very angry, sorry and afflicted at the\nseparation from his beloved wife, thus :-- In this world, the Brahmins that\nknow the Dharma S'astras, that are devoid of anger, are fit to be worshipped;\nand those that are not so, they are objects of disrespect and not to be\nworshipped by all for their anger. O sinless one! The beautiful one will\nsurely go to your house; what harm is there to you, if she waits here for a\nfew days?\n\n\n\nShe is staying here of her own accord to enjoy pleasures and will go back of\nher own will. One word more :-- You gave out before this opinion of the Dharma\nS'astras that as a Brahman though guilty of committing vicious deeds, becomes\npure again by the practice of Karmas as enjoined in the Vedas, so a woman,\ntoo, though guilty of adultery, becomes pure again when she is again in the\nperiod of her menstruation. At these words of Chandra Deva, Brihaspati, the\nGuru of the Devas, became exceedingly sorry and anxious and went back\nimmediately to his own house, with a grievous heart, full of amorous feelings.\nAfter staying in his own house for some days Brihaspati, worn out with\nanxiety, came again quickly to the house of Chandra; but, no sooner he was to\nenter the gate, he was stopped by the door-keepers; he became very angry and\nstopped at the gate way. And when he saw that Chandra did not make his\nappearance, he became exceedingly angry and thought :-- \xc2\x93Oh! What a wonder is\nthis? this irreligious Chandra, being my disciple, has done this vicious act\nand took by violence the wife of his Guru, who is reckoned as the mother; and\nI will now teach him a good lesson.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nStanding on the entrance gate way Brihaspati began to speak aloud :-- \xc2\x93O\nstupid, vicious, vilest of the Devas! Why do you now sleep in your inner room?\nDo return quickly my wife; else I will curse you at once. In case you do not\nbring me back my wife at once, I will now reduce you to ashes.\xc2\x94 Hearing these\nfoul words of Brihaspati, Chandra Deva the king of the Dvijas, quickly came\nout of the house and said smiling :-- \xc2\x93O Brahmin! Why are you spending your\nstock of words for nothing? That all-auspicious lady, of a blue colour and\nlooking askance, is not fit for you; therefore take another comparatively\nuglier woman for your use. Exceedingly youthful and lovely woman like her is\nnot fit for a beggar's house. O stupid one! I see, you don't know anything\nabout the Kama S'astra (the book that dwells\n\n\n\np. 38\n\n\n\non amorous passion); those wise men who are skilled in this S'astra assign for\nthe women, their lovers equivalent to their beauty in matters of amorous\ndealings. So, O stupid man! go away wherever you like. I won't give you back\nyour wife. Do whatever lies in your power. I won't return your wife. When you\nhave become passionate, your curse won't affect me in any way. This I say\nfinally unto you :-- \xc2\x93O Guru! I will not give you back your wife; do what you\nwish.\xc2\x94 Thus spoken by Chandra, Brihaspati became vary anxious and angry; he\nthen went away quickly to the Indra's house.\n\n\n\nSeeing Guru Deva morose and sorry, the very liberal minded Indra Deva\nworshipped him duly with padya, arghya, and \xc3\x82chamaniya and asked :-- \xc2\x93O highly\nfortunate one! Why do you look so anxious? O great Muni! Why are you grievous\nand sorry? You are my Guru; is it that you are insulted by any one in my\nkingdom; say freely. All the Regents of the several quarters (the Lokapalas)\nand all the Deva armies are under your command. Brahma, Vi _sn_ u, and\nMahes'var and other Devas are ready to lend you every assistance, no doubt. So\nsay what is the cause of your anxiety?\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of Indra,\nBrihaspati said :-- \xc2\x93Chandra has stolen my beautiful-eyed wife. I asked for\nher, again and again, but that wicked soul is not returning me my wife at all.\nO Lord of the Devas! What am I to do now? You are my help and guide. O\nS'atakratu! You are the lord of the Devas; therefore I pray to you with a very\ngrievous heart, help me in this matter.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, Indra said :-- \xc2\x93O\nknower of Dharma! Do not be sorry. O Suvrata! I am your servant. O highly\nintelligent one! Surely I will bring you back your wife. I will send a\nmessenger and even then if Chandra, mad with pride, do not return your wife, I\nwill wage war with him and fight against him, with all our Deva armies.\xc2\x94 Thus\nconsoling Brihaspati, Indra sent a very clever man, who was a good speaker and\nwonderful in his capabilities, to Chandra. The clever and wise messenger went\nto the Chandra Loka (the region of the Moon) and spoke to Chandra, the husband\nof Rohi _n_ i, thus :-- \xc2\x93O Mahabhaga! Indra has sent me to you to communicate\nhis message to you. So O intelligent one! I will tell you what he has ordered\nme; hear.\xc2\x94 He said :-- \xc2\x93O highly fortunate one! You know well Dharma and Niti\nS'astra (the science of morals); the more so, because the virtuous Mahar _s_ i\nAtri is your father. Therefore, O Suvrata! You ought not to commit such\nblameable act. See, all beings should protect their own wives always without\nremaining idle to the best of their powers; therefore, no doubt, quarrels\nwould ensue necessarily on that point. O Sudhanidhi! as far as this point of\nprotecting one's wife is concerned, your Guru Deva ought also to do his best.\nYou ought to consider all persons like your own self.\n\n\n\np. 39\n\n\n\nO Sudhakara! You have got twenty-eight exceedingly beautiful wives, who are\nthe daughters of Dak _s_ a; why then do you desire to enjoy the wife of your\nGuru? The beautiful Apsaras (celestial nymphs) Menaka and others are always\nresiding in the Heavens; you can enjoy them to your heart's content; leave off\nthe wife of your Guru. In case any powerful man commits an unworthy act out of\negoism, the illiterate ones would follow them; so the Dharma will decline.\nTherefore, O highly lucky one! Do such as does not lead, for nothing, quarrels\namongst the gods and leave your Guru's wife, even beautiful.\xc2\x94 Hearing these\nwords from the messenger, the Moon (Chandra Deva) became somewhat angry and,\nmaking gestures, replied to the messenger, as if to Indra, thus :--\n\n\n\nO mighty armed one! As you yourself are the lord of the Devas and the knower\nof Dharma, so your priest, too, has become like you; the head of both of you\nare the same. You will find many that can show their learning and give advice\nto others, but you will find always very rare such persons as will act\nthemselves to their own advices when occasion arises and wants them to fulfil\ntheir own words. O Lord of the Devas! All the persons take the opinion of the\nS'astras framed by Brihaspati then why the quarrel would ensue with me and the\nDevas when I an enjoying, according to his dictates, a woman who is herself\nwilling? See also, that the rule in this world is might is right; all things\ngo to the powerful man who can take by force; nothing falls to the lot of the\nweak; moreover this woman is mine and that woman is of another, this false\nnotion comes to those whose brains are weak. When Tara, is so much attached to\nme and is not at all attached to Brihaspati, the above rule applicable to me\nall the more; how then can I quit the lady so much attached to me, according\nto the laws of Dharma and the morals? You can see also, that happiness reigns\nin that family where the wife is according to the will of the husband; how,\nthen, can the household happiness exist when the lady of the house is always\ndissatisfied? Therefore the household happiness of the Guru is impossible as\nTara is dissatified with Brihaspati since he enjoyed the wife of his younger\nbrother Samvarta. Then the result comes to this, O thousand eyed one! How have\nyou come to be thousand eyed! However that may be, you are the lord of the\nDevas; you can do whatever you like. O messenger! go and tell your lord of the\nDevas all that I have spoken; I will not return by any means that beautiful\nTara.\n\n\n\nWhen Chandra spoke thus, the messenger went back to Indra and communicated to\nhim all that Chandra Deva had spoken. Hearing this, Indra became angry and\nordered all the Deva forces to be ready at once. Hearing this news of war,\nS'ukracharya, out of enmity to Brihaspati, went to\n\n\n\np. 40\n\n\n\nChandra and spoke thus :-- \xc2\x93O highly intelligent one! never return Tara; in\ncase if war ensues between you and Indra, I will help you by my\nMantra-S'akti.\xc2\x94 On the other hand, Bhagavan S'ankara, hearing of the vicious\nact of Chandra's, taking his Guru's wife, and knowing that S'ukracharya was\nthe enemy of Brihaspati, came to the assistance of the Devas. The great war,\nthen, ensued between the Devas like the terrific war of Tarakasura; it\ncontinued for many years. Then the grandfather Brahma, seeing the great havoc\nin the lives of the Devas and Asuras, came there on his vahan Hamsa, to secure\npeace and talked to Chandra :-- \xc2\x93Quit the Guru's wife; if not, I will call Vi\n_sn_ u and destroy all of you party.\xc2\x94 He also desisted the son of Bhrigu,\nS'ukracharya, saying :-- \xc2\x93O highly intelligent one! why has this wicked idea\npossessed your mind? Is it due to the bad association?\xc2\x94 Then S'ukracharya also\ntold Chandra, the lord of the medicinal plants, not to wage war and said :--\n\xc2\x93Better quit you now the Guru's wife. Your father Mahar _s_ i Atri has sent me\nto you for this purpose.\xc2\x94 Chandra, then, hearing the strange words of\nS'ukracharya, returned to Brihaspati his wife Tara, though she was not\nsatisfied with him and became herself pregnant.\n\n\n\nBrihaspati returned with joy to his house, accompanied by his wife; the Devas\nand Danavas went away to their respective places. Brahma went to Brahmaloka\nand S'ankara went to Kailas'a.\n\n\n\nBrihaspati began to pass his time happily with his beautiful wife; Some days\nwent away when the wife of Brihaspati, Tara, gave birth to an all-auspicious\nson, having all the qualities of Chandra, on an auspicious day and under the\ninfluence of an auspicious star; seeing this new-born child, Brihaspati gladly\nperformed the natal ceremonies of the child. Hearing that a son is born to\nhim, Chandra sent a messenger to Brihaspati saying that \xc2\x93That the child is not\nhis; but it is born out of the semen of mine; why, then, have you performed\nthe natal ceremonies out of your own will?\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of Chandra's\nmessenger, Brihaspati said :-- \xc2\x93No, this child is mine, no doubt, as he\nresembles quite like me.\xc2\x94 When Brihaspati said this, war again ensued. The\nDevas and Danavas met each other again in battle field; and councils of war\nwere held. Then, for the preservation of peace, Prajapati Brahma went there;\nand before all desisted the Devas; and Danavas, mad for war, and ready to\nfight against each other. Brahma, then, asked Tara :-- \xc2\x93O auspicious one! say\ntruly whose child is this? O beautiful one! if you say truly, then this war\nresulting in the loss of so many lives, will cease.\xc2\x94 The handsome Tara,\nlooking askance, lowered her head with shame and gently spoke to Brahma :--\n\xc2\x93This is the Chandra's child\xc2\x94 and went inside. Chandra Deva, then, became very\nglad and took the child, put down its name as Budha and carried it, to his own\nhouse. Bhagavan\n\n\n\np. 41\n\n\n\nBrahma, Indra and the other Devas went back to their respective places. All\nthe spectators went also to their own places whence they came. O Munis! I have\nnow described the birth of Budha, as the son of Chandra and in the womb of\nBrihaspati's wife, as I heard it from the mouth of Vyasa Deva, the son of\nSatyavati.\n\n\n\nThus ends the eleventh chapter of the 1st Skandha on the birth of Budha in the\nMahapura _n_ a S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyas.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 12](bk01ch12.htm)\n\n"
