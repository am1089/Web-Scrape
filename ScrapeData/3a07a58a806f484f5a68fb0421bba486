Or in the same way as the big and long from the short and the atomic.\n\nWe have shown that the theory of the Pradhana being the universal cause is\nuntenable, since it rests on fallacious arguments, and suffers from inner\ncontradictions. We shall now prove that the view of atoms constituting the\nuniversal cause is untenable likewise. 'Or in the same way as the big and long\nfrom the short and the atomic' 'Is untenable' must be supplied from the\npreceding Sutra; 'or' has to be taken in the sense of 'and.' The sense of the\nSutra is--in the same way as the big and long, i.e. as the theory of ternary\ncompounds originating from the short and the atomic, i.e. from binary\ncompounds and simple atoms is untenable, so everything else which they (the\nVai _s_ eshikas) maintain is untenable; or, in other words--as the theory of\nthe woild originating from atoms through binary compounds is untenable, so\neverything else is likewise untenable.--Things consisting of parts, as e.g. a\npiece of cloth, are produced by their parts, e.g. threads, being joined by\nmeans of the six sides which are parts of those parts. Analogously the atoms\nalso must be held to originate binary compounds in the way of combining by\nmeans of their six sides; for if the atoms possessed no distinction of parts\n(and hence filled no space), a group of even a thousand atoms would not differ\nin extension from a single atom, and the different kinds of extension--\nminuteness, shortness, bigness, length, &c.--would never emerge. If, on the\nother hand, it is admitted that the atoms also have distinct sides, they have\nparts and are made up of those parts, and those parts again are made up of\ntheir parts, and so on in infiuitum.--But, the Vai _s_ eshika may object, the\ndifference between a mustard seed and a mountain is due to the paucity of the\nconstituent\n\np. 496\n\nparts on the one hand, and their multitude on the other. If, now, it be held\nthat the atom itself contains an infinity of parts, the mustard seed and the\nmountain alike will contain an infinity of parts, and thus their inequality\ncannot be accounted for. We must therefore assume that there is a limit of\nsubdivision (i.e. that there are real atoms which do not themselves consist of\nparts).--Not so, we reply. If the atoms did not possess distinct parts, there\ncould originate no extension greater than the extension of one atom (as\nalready shown), and thus neither mustard seed nor mountain would ever be\nbrought about.--But what, then, are we to do to get out of this dilemma?--You\nhave only to accept the Vedic doctrine of the origination of the world.\n\nOthers explain the above Sutra as meant to refute an objection against the\ndoctrine of Brahman being the general cause. But this does not suit the\narrangement of the Sutras, and would imply a meaningless iteration. The\nobjections raised by some against the doctrine of Brahman have been disposed\nof in the preceding pada, and the present pada is devoted to the refutation of\nother theories. And that the world admits of being viewed as springing from an\nintelligent principle such as Brahman was shown at length under II, 1, 4. The\nsense of the Sutra, therefore, is none other than what we stated above.--But\nwhat are those other untenable views to which the Sutra refers?--To this\nquestion the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 11. On both assumptions also there is no motion, and thence non-being\nof the origination of the world](sbe48216.htm)\n\n"
