Vyasa said :-- After gaining the victory in the battle, the king Yudhajit\nreturned to the city of Ayodhya with his huge army and asked where are\nSudars\xc2\x92ana and Manorama? He wanted to kill Sudars\xc2\x92ana.\n\n\n\n2\\. He repeatedly exclaimed \xc2\x93Where are they gone?\xc2\x94 and sent his servants\n\n\n\np. 183\n\n\n\non their search. Then, on an auspicious day, he installed his daughter\xc2\x92s son\non the throne.\n\n\n\n3\\. Mahar _s_ i Vas\xc2\x92i _st_ ha was engaged as the priest; he and the other\nministers began to chant the auspicious hymns of the Atharvaveda and with the\njars, filled with water, and consecrated by these hymns, installed S\xc2\x92atrujit\non the throne.\n\n\n\n4\\. O best of the Kurus! Conch shells resounded; drums, bheris and turiyas,\nresounded; and great festivals and rejoicings took place in the city.\n\n\n\n5\\. The reciting of the Vedic mantrams by the Brahma _n_ s, the chanting of\nhymns by the bards and the auspicious acclamation of Victory to the new king\nresounded the whole city of Ayodhya with joy.\n\n\n\n6\\. When the new king S\xc2\x92atrujit ascended on the throne, the subjects were\nfilled with joy; everywhere hymns were sung; drums were resound. At this\nAyodhya looked as fresh as ever.\n\n\n\n7-8. O King! Though there were thus great rejoicings and festivals, yet some\ngood persons were found that remembered Sudars\xc2\x92ana and gave vent to this\nfeeling of sorrow, thus :-- \xc2\x93Alas! Where has that prince gone? Where has that\nchaste queen Manorama gone with her son? Oh! The enemies have killed his\nfather for greed of kingdom.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n9\\. The saints with their views impartial, thus rendered uneasy, sorry, began\nto pass away their time there subject to S\xc2\x92atrujit.\n\n\n\n10\\. After installing duly his daughter\xc2\x92s son on the throne and after having\nmade over the charge of the kingdom to the wise councillors, Yudhajit turned\ntowards his own city.\n\n\n\n11-12. Afterwards Yudhajit heard that Sudars\xc2\x92ana was staying in the hermitage\nwith the Munis. He started at once for Chitrakuta and went quickly to\nDurdars\xc2\x92a, the chief of the city of Sringavera, being accompanied by Bala, the\nchief of the Nisadas.\n\n\n\n13-15. Hearing that Yudhajit was coming there with his army, Manorama began to\nthink that his son was a minor and became very sorrowful, distressed and\nterrified. Then she with tears in her eyes addressed the Muni thus :--\n\xc2\x93Yudhajit is coming here; what shall I do and whither shall I go? He has slain\nmy father, and has installed his daughter\xc2\x92s son on the throne. Still he is not\nsatisfied and he is now coming with his army here to kill my minor child.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n16-21. O Lord! In days of yore, I heard that the Pandavas, when they went to\nthe forest, lived in the holy hermitage of the Munis with Draupadi. One day\nthe five brethren went a hunting, and the beautiful Draupadi stayed without\nany fear with other maid servants in the\n\n\n\np. 184\n\n\n\nhermitage where there was the chanting of the Vedas by Dhaumya, Attri, Galava,\nPaila, Javali, Gautama, Bhrigu, Chyavana, Kanva of the Atrigotra, Jatu, Kratu,\nVitihotra, Sumantu, Yaj\xc3\xb1adatt, Vatsala, Ras'asana, Kaho _d_ a, Yavakri,\nYaj\xc3\xb1akrit, Kratu and other holy high souled Ri _s_ is like Bharadvaja and\nothers.\n\n\n\n22-23. While the five great heroes Arju _n_ a and others, the destroyers of\ntheir enemies, were roaming in the forests, Jayadratha, the king of Sindhu\ncame with his army to the hermitage, hearing the reciting of the Vedic hymns.\n\n\n\n24\\. Hearing thus, that king quickly descended from the chariot so that he\nmight have a sight of these holy mahar _s_ is.\n\n\n\n25-27. Accompanied by two attendants only, he approached to the Munis and,\nfinding them engaged in the study of the Vedas, waited there with folded hands\nfor an opportunity. O Lord! When the king Jayadratha on entering the hermitage\ntook his seat, the wives of the Munis came there to see the king and began to\nenquire \xc2\x93Who is this person?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n28\\. With the wives of the Munis came there also the beautiful Draupadi.\nJayadratha looked upon Draupadi as if she were the second goddess Lak _s_ mi.\n\n\n\n29-30. Looking at that lovely royal daughter who looked like the Deva girls\nJayadratha asked the Mahar _s_ i Dhaumya, \xc2\x93Who is this beautiful lotus eyed\nlady? Whose wife is she and who is her father? What is her name? Oh! From her\nbeautiful appearance it seems that the goddess S\xc2\x92achi has come down on earth.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n31\\. This fair woman is shining like the celestial nymph Rambha surrounded by\nthe Rak _s_ asis or like the beautiful creeper Lavangalatika encircled by\nthorny trees.\n\n\n\n32\\. O good ones! Tell truly whose beloved is she? O Brahmi _n_ s! It seems\nthat she is the wife of some king, not the wife of a Muni.\n\n\n\n33\\. Dhaumya said :-- \xc2\x93O king of Sindhu! She is the daughter of Panchala; her\nname is Draupadi; she is the wife of the Pandavas; they are residing in this\nforest, having got rid of their fears.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n34\\. Jayadratha said \xc2\x93Where have those powerful Pandavas of great prowess gone\nnow? Are they dwelling in this forest, free from fears?\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n35\\. Dhaumya said :-- \xc2\x93The five Pandavas have gone out on hunting, ascended on\na chariot. They will return at noon with their game.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n36-37. Hearing the Muni's words Jayadratha got up, and going near to Draupadi,\nbowed down to her and said :-- \xc2\x93O Fair One! Is there every-\n\n\n\np. 185\n\n\n\nthing well with you? Where have your husbands gone? To-day it is eleven years\nthat you are residing in the forest.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n38\\. Draupadi then said :-- \xc2\x93O prince! Let all be well with you, wait here for\na short while; the Pandavas are coming quickly.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n39\\. While Draupadi thus spoke, that powerful king, being overpowered with\ngreed and avarice, stole her away, disregarding all the Munis present there.\n\n\n\n40-42. O Lord! The wise should never trust any body; if on any body he places\nhis trust, he will surely come to grief. For example, see the case of the king\nBali. Bali, the son of Virochana, and the grandson of Prahlada, was\nprosperous, devoted to his religion, true to his promise, performer of\nsacrifices, generous, always giving protection to and liked by the saints and\na great warrior. His mind never turned to any irreligious subject and he\nperformed ninety nine Yaj\xc3\xb1as with full Dak _s_ i _n_ as (remunerations).\n\n\n\n43-44. But the Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u, who is all full of Sattvic purity and who\nis never affected with passions and changeless, who is always worshipped by\nthe Yogis, He, in the form of a dwarf in his Vamana incarnation as the son of\nKas'yapa Ri _s_ i, to serve the Devas, stole away his whole seagirt earth and\nkingdom deceitfully on hypocritical pretext.\n\n\n\n45\\. O Lord! I heard that the son of Virochana was a generous large hearted\nking. He truly resolved to give what was wanted; but Vi _sn_ u behaved with\nhim deceitfully to serve the cause of Indra.\n\n\n\n46\\. When the pure, Sattvik Vi _sn_ u could assume this dwarf incarnation to\nbring about the hindrance to Bali\xc2\x92s Yaj\xc3\xb1a, what wonder is that other ordinary\nmortals would practise things like that?\n\n\n\n47\\. Therefore never trust on any body in any way. Lord! Where there are greed\nand avarice, reigning in one\xc2\x92s heart, what fear can he have to perpetrate any\nevil deed?\n\n\n\n48-49. O Muni! It is through avarice that men commit sinful deeds; they do not\ncare what good or bad will happen to them in the next world. Thoroughly\noverpowered by greed, they take away in mind, word and deed other\xc2\x92s things;\nand thus they become fallen.\n\n\n\n50-51. Lo! Human beings always worship the Gods for wealth; but the Devas do\nnot give them wealth instantly; they give them these things through others by\nmaking them carry on trade, make gifts, or shew their strength or by making\nthem steal.\n\n\n\np. 186\n\n\n\n52\\. The Vais\xc2\x92yas worship the Gods simply because they think they will be\nhighly prosperous and therefore they sell many things as grains, cloth and the\nlike.\n\n\n\n53\\. O Controlled one! Is there not the desire to take away the other\xc2\x92s\nproperty in this act of merchandise? Certainly there is. Besides the\nmerchants, when they find that when people are in urgent need of buying\narticles from them, expect that the price of those articles might run higher.\n\n\n\n54\\. O Muni! Thus every one is anxious to take away other\xc2\x92s properties. How,\nthen, can we trust them?\n\n\n\n55\\. Those who are clouded by greed and delusion, their going to places of\npilgrimages, their making charities, their reciting the Vedas, all are\nrendered useless. Though they go to the holy places, etc., still these things\nbear no fruits to them, as if they have not done these things at all.\n\n\n\n56\\. Therefore O Enlightened one! You make Yudhajit go back to his own place.\nThen I will be able to remain here, like Sita, with my son.\n\n\n\n57-58. On Manorama's thus speaking to the Muni, the fiery Mahar _s_ i went to\nYudhajit and said :-- \xc2\x93O King! You better go back to your own place or\nanywhere else you like. The son of Manorama is a minor; that queen is very\nmuch grieved; she cannot come to you now.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n59\\. Yudhajit said \xc2\x93O peaceful ones! Kindly cease showing this impudence and\ngive me Manorama. I will never go away leaving her. If you do not give her\neasily, I will take her away by force.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n60\\. The Ri _s_ is said \xc2\x93O King! If there be any strength in you, you can take\naway Manorama by force; but the result will be similar to that when the King\nVisvamitra wanted to take away the heavenly cow by force from the hermitage of\nVas'i _st_ ha.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nThus ends the Sixteenth Chapter on the glory of the Devi and the going of the\nKing Yudhajit to the hermitage of Bharadvaja, to kill Sudars\xc2\x92ana, in the the\n3rd Adhyaya of S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 17](bk03ch17.htm)\n\n"
