(The statements concerning connexion and difference) are due to\ndifference of place; in the manner of light and so on.\n\nThe present Sutra refutes the allegation that something different from Brahman\nexists, firstly, because things are said to be connected with Brahman, and\nsecondly, because things are said to be separate from it. The fact is, that\nall those statements regarding connexion and difference are made with a view\nto difference of place. When the cognition of difference which is produced by\nthe Selfs connexion with different places, i.e. with the buddhi and the other\nlimiting adjuncts, ceases on account of the cessation of those limiting\nadjuncts themselves, connexion with the highest Self is metaphorically said to\ntake place; but that is done with a view to the limiting adjuncts only, not\nwith a view to any limitation on the part of the Self.--In the same way, all\nstatements regarding difference have reference to the difference of Brahman's\nlimiting adjuncts only, not to any difference affecting Brahman's own nature.\n--All this\n\np. 179\n\nis analogous to the case of light and the like. For the light of the sun or\nthe moon also is differentiated by its connexion with limiting adjuncts, and\nis, on account of these adjuncts, spoken of as divided, and, when the adjuncts\nare removed, it is said to enter into connexion (union). Other instances of\nthe effect of limiting adjuncts are furnished by the ether entering into\nconnexion with the eyes of needles and the like.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 2, 35](sbe38138.htm)\n\n"
