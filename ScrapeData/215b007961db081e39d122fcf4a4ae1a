Now a Brahma _n_ a may take four wives in the direct order of the (four)\ncastes;\n\n2\\. A Kshatriya, three;\n\n3\\. A Vai _s_ ya, two;\n\n4\\. A _S_ udra, one only.\n\n5\\. Among these (wives), if a man marries one of his own caste, their hands\nshall be joined.\n\n6\\. In marriages with women of a different class, a Kshatriya bride must hold\nan arrow in her hand;\n\n7\\. A Vai _s_ ya bride,. a whip;\n\n8\\. A _S_ udra bride, the skirt of a mantle.\n\n9\\. No one should marry a woman belonging to the same Gotra, or descended from\nthe same _Ri_ shi ancestors, or from the same Pravaras.\n\n[XXIV. 1-4. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 21, 74; M. III, 12-14; Y.

This chapter opens the section on Sa _m_ skaras or sacraments, i. e. the\nceremonies on conception and so forth. (Nand.) This section forms the second\npart of the division treating of Akira. See above, XIX.\n\n9\\. According to Nand., the term Gotra refers to descent from one of the seven\n_Ri_ shis, or from Agastya as the eighth; the term \xc3\x82rsha ( _Ri_ shi\nancestors), to descent from the \xc3\x82rshtishe _n_ as or Mudgalas, {footnote p.\n107} or from some other subdivision of the Bh _ri_ gus or \xc3\x82 _n_ girasas,\nexcepting the _G_ amadagnas, Gautamas, and Bharadva _g_ as; and the term\nPravara, to the Mantrak _ri_ ts of one's own race, i. e. the ancestors invoked\nby a Brahma _n_ a at the commencement of a sacrifice. Nand.'s interpretation\nof the last term is no doubt correct; but it seems preferable to take Gotra in\nthe sense of 'family name' (laukika gotra), and to refer the term samanarsha\nto descent from the same _Ri_ shi (vaidika gotra). See Dr. Buhler's notes on\n\xc3\x82past. II, 5, 11, 15, and Gaut. XVIII, 6; Max Muller, History of Ancient\nSanskrit Literature, pp. 379-388; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 69-41. If arsha were\nconnected with pravara, the whole compound samanarshapravara would denote 'a\nwoman descended from the same _Ri_ shi '= samanarsha, Y. I, 53, and\nsamanapravara, Gaut. XVIII, 6.]\n\np. 107\n\n10\\. Nor (should he marry) one descended from his maternal ancestors within\nthe fifth, or from his paternal ancestors within the seventh degree;\n\n11\\. Nor one of a low family (such as an agriculturer's, or an attendant of\nthe king's family);\n\n12\\. Nor one diseased;\n\n13\\. Nor one with a limb too much (as e. g. having six fingers);\n\n14\\. Nor one with a limb too little;\n\n15\\. Nor one whose hair is decidedly red;\n\n16\\. Nor one talking idly.\n\n17\\. There are eight forms of marriage\n\n18\\. The Brahma, Daiva, \xc3\x82rsha, Pra _g_ apatya, Gandharva, \xc3\x82sura, Rakshasa, and\nPai _s_ a _k_ a forms.\n\n19\\. The gift of a damsel to a fit bridegroom, who has been invited, is called\na Brahma marriage.\n\n20\\. If she is given to a _Ri_ tvi _g_ (priest), while he is officiating at a\nsacrifice, it is called a Daiva marriage.\n\n21\\. If (the giver of the bride) receives a pair of kine in return, a is\ncalled an \xc3\x82rsha marriage.\n\n22\\. (If she is given to a suitor) by his demand, it is called a Pra _g_\napatya marriage.\n\np. 108\n\n23\\. A union between two lovers, without the consent of mother and father, is\ncalled a Gandharva marriage.\n\n24\\. If the damsel is sold (to the bridegroom), it is called an \xc3\x82sura\nmarriage.\n\n25\\. If he seizes her forcibly, it is called a Rakshasa marriage.\n\n26\\. If he embraces her in her sleep, or while she is unconscious, it is\ncalled a Pai _s_ a _k_ a marriage.\n\n27\\. Among those (eight forms of marriage), the four first forms are\nlegitimate (for a Brahma _n_ a);\n\n28\\. And so is the Gandharva form for a Kshatriya.\n\n29\\. A son procreated in a Brahma marriage redeems (or sends into the heavenly\nabodes hereafter mentioned) twenty-one men (viz. ten ancestors, ten\ndescendants, and him who gave the damsel in marriage).\n\n30\\. A son procreated in a Daiva marriage, fourteen;\n\n31\\. A son procreated in an \xc3\x82rsha marriage, seven;\n\n32\\. A son procreated in a Pra _g_ apatya marriage, four.\n\n33\\. He who gives a damsel in marriage according to the Brahma rite, brings\nher into the world of Brahman (after her death, and enters that world\nhimself).\n\n34\\. (He who gives her in marriage) according to the Daiva rite, (brings her)\ninto Svarga (or heaven, and enters Svarga himself).\n\n35\\. (He who gives her in marriage) according to the \xc3\x82rsha rite, (brings her)\ninto the world of Vish _n_ u (and enters that world himself).\n\np. 109\n\n36\\. (He who gives her in marriage) according to the Pra _g_ apatya rite,\n(brings her) into the world of the gods (and enters that world himself).\n\n37\\. (He who gives her in marriage) according to the Gandharva rite, will go\nto the world of Gandharvas.\n\n38\\. A father, a paternal grandfather, a brother, a kinsman, a maternal\ngrandfather, and the mother (are the persons) by whom a girl may be given in\nmarriage.\n\n39\\. On failure of the preceding one (it devolves upon) the next in order (to\ngive her in marriage), in case he is able.\n\n40\\. When she has allowed three monthly periods to pass (without being\nmarried), let her choose a husband for herself; three monthly periods having\npassed, she has in every case full power to dispose of herself (as she thinks\nbest).\n\n41\\. A damsel whose menses begin to appear (while she is living) at her\nfather's house, before she has been betrothed to a man, has to be considered\nas a degraded woman: by taking her (without the consent of her kinsmen) a man\ncommits no wrong.\n\n[39. Regarding the causes effecting legal disability, such as love, anger,\n&c., see Narada 3, 43.\n\n40\\. Nand., arguing from a passage of Baudhayana (see also M. IX, 90), takes\n_ri_ tu, 'monthly period,' as synonymous with varsha, 'year.' But _ri_ tu,\nwhich occurs in two other analogous passages also (Gaut. XVIII, 20, and Narada\nXII, 24), never has that meaning.\n\n41\\. Nand. observes, that the rules laid down in this and the preceding Sloka\nrefer to young women of the lower castes only. Nowadays the custom of\noutcasting young women, who have not been married in the proper time, appears\nto be in vogue in Brahmanical families particularly. Sm _ri_ ti passages\nregarding the illegality of marriages concluded with such women have been\ncollected by me, \xc3\x9cber die rechtl. Stellung der Frauen, p. 9, note 17. The\n{footnote p. 110} custom of Svaya _m_ vara or 'self-choice,' judging from the\nepics, was confined to females of the kingly caste, and in reality was no\ndoubt of very rare occurrence.]\n\np. 110\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXV.](sbe07027.htm)\n\n"
