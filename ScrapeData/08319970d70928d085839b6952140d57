They are historical records of true facts of the Hindu books on\nphilosophy, and are like a visit to that old ancient Temple of Mathra.\n\nHis manner of teaching and writing inspires us with the knowledge of\nourselves, to be the same as the Universal Brotherhood--, Self of the\nUniverse, with God\'s poise and sense of mastery.\n\nHis books give us the blessed assurance that\n\nwe no longer need to travel to get wisdom. Study TRUTH and absorb its\nteachings, and the world will come to you, as it has to him.\n\nMay Peace be Unto him, together with a benediction of love, with our\nblessings.\n\nDr. and Mrs. J. D. Ward.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Contents](yvhf01.htm)\n\n'
