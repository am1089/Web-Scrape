They are generally a well-favoured, well-to-\ndo people, noticeable for their superior frugality, intelligence, and\nindustry, and for the way in which they combine and act together as a separate\nbody apart from other Hindoos. They have many peculiarities of costume, of\nsocial ceremony, and of religion, which strike even a casual observer; and\nthough clearly not aboriginal, they seem to have much ground for their claim\nto belong to a more ancient race, and an earlier wave of immigration, than\nmost of the Hindoo nations with which they are now intermingled.\n\nThe country they inhabit is tolerably familiar to most English readers on\nIndian subjects, for it is the theatre of many of the events described in the\ngreat Duke's earlier despatches, and in the writings of Munro, of Wilkes, and\nBuchanan. The extraordinary beauty of some of the natural features of the\ncoast scenery, and the abundance of the architectural and other remains of\npowerful and highly civilised Hindoo dynasties, have attracted the attention\nof tourists and antiquaries, though not to the extent their intrinsic merit\ndeserves. Some knowledge of the land tenures and agriculture of the country is\naccessible to readers of Indian Blue-books.\n\nBut of all that relates to the ancient history and politics of the former\nHindoo sovereigns of these regions very little is known to the general reader,\nthough from their power, and riches, and long-sustained civilisation, as\nproved by the monuments these rulers have left behind them, there are few\nparts of India better worth the attention of the historian and antiquary.\n\nOf the inner life of the people, past or present, of their social\npeculiarities and popular beliefs, even less is known or procurable in any\npublished form. With the exception of a few graphic and characteristic notices\nof shrewd observers like Munro, little regarding them is to be found in the\nwritings of any author likely to come in the way of ordinary readers.\n\nBut this is not from want of materials; a good deal has been published in\nIndia, though with the common fate of Indian publications,--the books\ncontaining the information are often rare in English collections, and\ndifficult to meet with in England, except in a few public libraries. Of\nunpublished material there must be a vast amount, collected not only by our\nGovernment servants, but by missionaries, and others residing in the country,\nwho have peculiar opportunities for observation, and for collecting\ninformation not readily to be obtained by a stranger or an official.\nCollections of this kind are specially desirable as regards the popular non-\nBrahminical superstitions of the lower orders.\n\nFew, even of those who have lived many years in India and made some inquiry\nregarding the external religion of its inhabitants, are aware how little the\npopular belief of the lower classes has in common with the Hindooism of the\nBrahmins, and how much it differs in different provinces, and in different\nraces and classes in the same province.\n\nIn the immediate vicinity of Poona, where Brahminism seems so orthodox and\npowerftul, a very little observation will satisfy the inquirer that the\nfavourite objects of popular worship do not always belong to the regular\nHindoo Pantheon. No orthodox Hindoo deity is so popular in the Poona Deccan as\nthe deified sage Vithoba and his earlier expounders, both sage and followers\nbeing purely local divinities. Wherever a few of the pastoral tribes are\nsettled, there Byroba, the god of the herdsmen, or Kundoba, the deified hero\nof the shepherds, supersedes all other popular idols. Byroba the Terrible, and\nother remnants of Fetish or of Snake-worship, everywhere divide the homage of\nthe lower castes with the recognised Hindoo divinities, while outside almost\nevery village the circle of large stones sacred to Vetal, the demon-god of the\noutcast helot races, which reminds the traveller of the Druid circles of the\nnorthern nations, has for ages held, and still holds, its ground against all\nBrahminical innovations.\n\nSome of these local or tribal divinities, when their worshippers are very\nnumerous or powerful, have been adopted into the Hindoo Olympus as\nincarnations or manifestations of this or that orthodox divinity, and one or\ntwo have been provided with elaborate written legends connecting them with\nknown Puranic characters or events; but, in general, the true history of the\nlocal deity, if it survives at all, is to be found only in popular tradition;\nand it thus becomes a matter of ethnological and historical unimportance to\nsecure all such fleeting remnants of ancient Superstition before they are\nforgotten as civilisation advances.\n\nSome information of this kind is to be gleaned from the present series of\nlegends, though, the object of the collector being rather amusement than\nantiquarian research, any light which is thrown on the popular superstitions\nof the country is only incidental.\n\nOf the superhuman personages who appear in them the 'Rakshas' is the most\nprominent. This being has many features in common with the Demoniacal Ogre of\nother lands. The giant bulk and terrible teeth of his usual form are the\nuniversal attributes of his congener. His habit of feasting on dead bodies\nwill remind the reader of the Arabian Ghoul, while the simplicity and\nstupidity which qualify the supernatural powers of the Rakshas, and usually\nenable the quick-witted mortal to gain the victory over him, will recall many\nhumorous passages in which giants figure in our own Norse and Teutonic\nlegends.\n\nThe English reader must bear in mind that in India beings of this or of a very\nsimilar nature are not mere traditions of the past, but that they form an\nimportant part of the existing practical belief of the lower orders. Grown men\nwill sometimes refuse every inducement to pass at night near the supposed\nhaunt of a Rakshas, and I have heard the cries of a belated traveller calling\nfor help attributed to a Rakshas luring his prey. Nor is darkness always an\nelement in this superstition: I have known a bold and experienced tracker of\ngame solemnly assert that figures which he had been for some time keenly\nscanning on the bare summit of a distant hill were beings of this order, and\nhe was very indignant at the laugh which his observation provoked from his\nless experienced European disciple. 'If your telescope could see as far as my\nold eyes,' the veteran said, 'or if you knew the movements of all the animals\nof this hunting-ground as well as I do, you would see that those must be\ndemons and nothing else. No men nor animals at this time of day would collect\non an open space and move about in that way. Besides, the large rock close by\nthem is a noted place for demons; every child in the village knows that.'\n\nI have heard another man of the same class, when asked why he looked so\nintently at a human footstep in the forest pathway, gravely observe that the\nfootmark looked as if the foot which made it had been walking heel foremost,\nand must therefore have been made by a Rakshas, 'for they always walked so,\nwhen in human form.'\n\nAnother expressed particular dread of a human face the eyes of which were\nplaced at an exaggerated angle to each other, like those of a Chinese or\nMalay, 'because that position of the eyes was the only way in which you could\nrecognise a Rakshas in human shape.'\n\nIn the more advanced and populous parts of the country the Rakshas seem giving\nway to the 'Bhoot,' which nearly resembles the mere ghost of modern European\nsuperstition; but even in this diluted form such beings have an influence over\nIndian imaginations to which it is difficult in these days to find any\nparallel in Europe.\n\nI found, quite lately, a traditionary order in existence at Government House,\nDapoorie, near Poona, which directed the native sentry on guard 'to present\narms if a cat or dog, jackal or goat, entered or left the house or crossed\nnear his beat' during certain hours of the night, 'because it was the ghost'\nof a former Governor, who was still remembered as one of the best and kindest\nof men.\n\nHow or when the custom originated I could not learn, but the order had been\nverbally handed on from one native sergeant of the guard to another for many\nyears, without any doubts as to its propriety or authority, till it was\naccidentally overheard by an English officer of the Governor's staff.\n\nIn the hills and deserts of Sind the belief in beings of this order, as might\nbe expected in a wild and desolate country, is found strong and universal;\nthere, however, the Rakshas has changed its name to that of our old friend the\n'Gin' of the Arabian Nights, and he has somewhat approximated in character to\nthe Pwcca or Puck of our own country. The Gin of the Beelooch hills is wayward\nand often morose, but not necessarily malignant. His usual form is that of a\ndwarfish human being with large eyes, and covered with long hair, and apt to\nbreathe with a heavy snoring kind of noise. From the circumstantial accounts I\nhave heard of such 'Gins' being seen seated on rocks at the side of lonely\npasses, I suspect that the great horned eagle owl, which is not uncommon in\nthe hill-country of Sind, has to answer for many well-vouched cases of Gin\napparition.\n\nThe Gin does not, however, always retain his own shape; he frequently changes\nto the form of a camel, goat, or other animal. If a Gin be accidentally met,\nit is recommended that the traveller should show no sign of fear, and above\nall should keep a civil tongue in his head, for the demon has a special\naversion to bad language. Every Beelooch has heard of instances in which such\nchance acquaintanceships with Gins have not only led to no mischief, but been\nthe source of much benefit to the fortunate mortal who had the courage and\nprudence to turn them to account, for a Gin once attached to a man will work\nhard and faithfully for him, and sometimes show him the entrance to those\ngreat subterranean caverns under the hills, where there is perpetual spring\nand trees laden with fruits of gold and precious stones; but the mortal once\nadmitted to this Paradise is never allowed to leave it. There are few\nneighbourhoods in the Beelooch hills which cannot show huge stones, apparently\nintended for building, which have been, 'as all the country-side knows,' moved\nby such agency, and the entrance to the magic cavern is never very far off,\nthough the boldest Beelooch is seldom very willing to show or to seek for the\nexact spot.\n\nSuperstitions nearly identical were still current within the last forty years,\nwhen I was a boy, on the borders of Wales. In Cwm Pwcca (the Fairies' Glen),\nin the valley of the Clydach, between Abergavenny and Merthyr, the cave used\nto be shown into which a belated miner was decoyed by the Pwccas, and kept\ndancing for ten years; and a farm-house on the banks of the Usk, not far off,\nwas, in the last generation, the abode of a farmer who had a friendly Pwcca in\nhis service. The goblin was called Pwcca Trwyn, as I was assured from his\noccasionally being visible as a huge human nose. He would help the mortal by\ncarrying loads and mending hedges, but usually worked only while the farmer\nslept at noon, and always expected as his guerdon a portion of the toast and\nale which his friend had for dinner in the field. If none was left for him he\nwould cease to work, and he once roused the farmer from his noontide slumbers\nby thrashing him soundly with his own hedging-stake, as a punishment for such\nneglect.\n\nThe Pens or Fairies of these stories have nothing distinctive about them. Like\nthe fairies of other lands they often fall in love with mortal men, and are\nvisible to the pure eyes of childhood when hidden from the grosser vision of\nmaturer years.\n\nNext to the Rakshas, the Cobra, or deadly hooded snake, plays the most\nimportant part in these legends as a supernatural personage. This is one only\nof the many traces still extant of that serpent-worship formerly so general in\nWestern India. As Mr. Fergusson, in his work on Buddhist antiquities,  1 has\nthrown much light on this curious subject, I will only now observe that the\nserpent-worship as it still exists is something more active than a mere\npopular superstition. The Cobra, unless disturbed, rarely goes far from home,\nand is supposed to watch jealously over a hidden treasure. He is in the\nestimation of the lower classes invested with supernatural powers, and\naccording to the treatment he receives he builds up or destroys the fortunes\nof the house to which he belongs. No native will willingly kill him if he can\nget rid of him in any other way; and the poorer classes always, after he is\nkilled, give him all the honours of a regular cremation, assuring him, with\nmany protestations, as the pile burns, 'that they are guiltless of his blood;\nthat they slew him by order of their master,' or 'that they had no other way\nto prevent his biting the children or the chickens.'\n\nA very interesting discussion on the subject of the Snake Race of Ancient\nIndia between Mr. Bayley and Baboo Rajendralal Mitr, will be found in the\nProceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for February 1867.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd02.htm#fr_0) Fergusson's _Tree and Serpent Worship -: Mythology and Art\nin India_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Collector's Apology](odd03.htm)\n\n"
