Naraya _n_ a said :-- The Jambudvipa has been described, how it is and\nwhat is its width. It is surrounded on all sides by the salt ocean. As Meru is\nsurrounded by Jambudvipa, so the salt ocean is surrounded by Plak _s_ advipa,\ntwice its size. As the ditch is surrounded by gardens, so the salt ocean is\nsurrounded by gardens. As the Jambu tree exists in Jambudvipa, so the Plak _s_\na tree exists in the Plak _s_ a Dvipa and of the same size. The name Plak _s_\na Dvipa is derived from the name of this Plak _s_ a tree. This tree is of a\ngolden colour. Fire exists at its bottom with form incarnate. This is, named\nSaptajihva. The Ruler of this island is Idhmajihva, the son of Priyavrata. He\ndivided his island into the seven Var _s_ as and distributed them, to each of\nhis seven sons and he himself took refuge of the path of Yoga, so much liked\nby the Knowers of Self and he got the Bhagavan Vasudeva. The names of those\nseven Dvipas are :-- S'iva, Yavas, Subhadra, Santi, K _s_ ema, Amrita, and\nAbhaya. Seven rivers and seven mountains exist respectively in the seven\nislands. The rivers are :-- Aru _n_ a, Nrimna, Angirasi, Savitri,\nSuprabhatika, _R_ itambhara, and Satyambhara. The names of the mountains are\nMa _n_ ikuta, Vajrakuta, Indrasena, Jyoti _s_ mana, Supar _n_ a, Hira _n_\nyasthiva, and Meghamala. The seeing and drinking the waters of these rivers\ntake away all sins and all darkness due to ignorance. The four castes live\nhere, Hamsa, Patanga, \xc3\x9brd _h_ ayana, and Satyanga, corresponding to the four\ncastes Brahma _n_ a, etc. The inhabitants of this Plak _s_ a Dvipa live for\none thousand years and all are of variegated wonderful appearances. They\nfollow the customs\n\n\n\np. 768\n\n\n\nand usages dictated by the Vedas and worship the God Sun for the attainment of\nHeaven. The mantra by which the worship is done is this :-- We take refuge\nunto that Sun, Who is the Body Manifest of the Ancient Person Vi _sn_ u and\nWho is the Ordainer of Satya (Truth), Rita (Straight forwardness), Brahma,\nAmrita (Immortality) and Mrityu (Death); O Narada! All the persons here live\nlong, of vigorous senses, energetic, powerful, intelligent, enthusiasts, and\nvalorous; everyone gets extraordinary powers of themselves. Next to this Plak\n_s_ a Dvipa is the Ik _s_ hu Ocean. This Ik _s_ u Sagara surrounds the Plak\n_s_ a Dvipa. Next comes S'almala Dvipa. It is twice as large as Plak _s_ a.\nThis Dvipa is surrounded by Surasagara (the ocean of wine). There is a tree\nnamed S'almali in this island, which is as large as the Plak _s_ a tree. The\nhigh-souled Garu _d_ a resides on that tree, Yaj\xc3\xb1avahu is the Ruler of this\nplace. He was born of Priyavrata; he divided his Var _s_ a into the seven\nparts and distributed each of them to his seven sons respectively. Now hear\nthe names of these Var _s_ as :-- Surochana, Saumanasya, Rama _n_ a, Deva Var\n_s_ a, Paribhadra, \xc3\x82pyayana, and Vij\xc3\xb1ata. Seven mountains and seven rivers\nexist there respectively. The names of the mountains are :-- Sarasa,\nS'atas'ringa, Vama Deva, Kandaka, Kumuda, Pu _s_ pavar _s_ a, and\nSahasra-S'ruti. Now hear the names of the rivers. Anumati, Sinibali,\nSarasvati, Kuhu, Rajani, Nanda, and Raka; these are the seven rivers. The\npeople are divided into the four castes :-- S'rutadhara, Viryadhara,\nVasundhara, I _s_ undhara. These correspond to the Brahma _n_ as, etc. They\nworship the Bhagavan Moon, the Controller of all and the Creator of all the\nVedas. They offer food duly in the black and white fortnight to their Pitris.\nThe mantra for their worship is :-- \xc2\x93Let Soma, the King of all, be pleased.\xc2\x94 O\nNarada! Next to Surasagara is Kus'advipa, surrounded by Ghritasagara (the\nocean of clarified butter). Its dimensions are twice as large. Here are blades\nof Kus'a grass, of a very resplendent colour. The name of the Dvipa is from\nthis Kus'astamba. This bundle of Kus'a, illumines all the quarters with their\ngentle rays. The Ruler of the Dvipa is Hira _n_ yareta, the son of Priyavrata.\nHe divided the Dvipa into seven parts and distributed each of them to each of\nhis seven sons respectively. The names of the seven sons are :-- Vasu,\nVasudana, Dhri _d_ haruchi, Nabhigupta, Stutyavrata, Vivikta, and Bhamadevaka.\nThere are seven mountains forming the seven boundaries and so are the seven\nrivers. Hear the names of these. The names of the mountains are :-- Chakra,\nChatuhs'ringa, Kapila, Chitre Devanika, Kuta, \xc3\x9brdharoma and Dravi _n_ a. The\nnames of the rivers are :-- Rasakulya, Madhukulya, Mitravinda, S'rutavinda,\nDevagarbha, Ghritachyut, and Mantramalika. The inhabitants of the Kus'advipa\ndrink the waters of these\n\n\n\np. 769\n\n\n\nrivers. There are the four castes here Kus'ala, Kovida, Abhiyukta, and Kulaka\ncorresponding to the Brahma _n_ as, etc. They are all powerful like Indra and\nthe other chief Devas; and all of them are omniscient. They worship the Fire\nGod and perform various good works in honour of Him. Their mantra is this :--\nO Fire! Thou carriest the oblations direct to Para Brahma. In the sacrifices\nof the Devas, Thou worshippest that Personal God and offerest to Him whatever\nare given in oblations, mentioning the respective limbs of His Body. Thus the\ninhabitants of that Dvipa worship the Fire God.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twelfth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the narration of Plak _s_\na, S'almala, and Kus'a Dvipas in the Mahapuranam, S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of\n18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 13](bk08ch13.htm)\n\n"
