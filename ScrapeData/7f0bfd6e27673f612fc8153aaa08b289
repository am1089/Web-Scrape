And the Sm _ri_ tis state (that).\n\nVyasa and others state in their sm _ri_ tis the highest Self is not afflicted\nby the pain of the individual soul, 'That highest Self is said to be eternal,\ndevoid of qualities, nor is it stained by the fruits of actions any more than\na lotus leaf by water. But that other Self whose essence is action is\nconnected with bondage and release; again and again it is joined with the\nseventeenfold aggregate 1.'--On the ground of the particle 'and' (in the\nSutra) we have to supply 'and scripture also records that.' So, for instance,\n'One of them eats the sweet fruit, the other looks on without eating' (Mu. Up.\nIII, 1, i), and 'The one Self within all things is never contaminated by the\nmisery of the world, being himself without' (Ka. Up. II, 5, ii).\n\nHere the purvapakshin raises a new objection.--If there is only one internal\nSelf of all beings, what room is there for permissions and prohibitions,\nworldly as well as Vedic? You must not reject this objection on the ground of\nyour having proved that the individual soul is a part of the Lord, and that\nthus injunctions and prohibitions may, without any mutual interference, apply\nto the soul which is different from the Lord. For there are other scriptural\npassages which teach that the soul is not different from the Lord, and\ntherefore not a part of him, as, for instance, the following ones:\n\np. 66\n\nHaving sent forth that he entered into it' (Taitt. Up. 11, 6); There is no\nother seer but he' (B _ri_. Up. III, 7, 23); 'From death to death goes he who\nperceives therein any diversity' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 19); 'Thou art that' (\n_Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 7); 'I am Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. I, 4, 10). Should you say\nthat just from this concurrence of intimations of difference on the one hand\nand non-difference on the other hand it follows that the soul is a part of the\nLord, we reply that such might be the case if the intention of the texts were\nto teach difference as well as non-difference. But the fact is that the texts\naim solely at teaching non-difference, because through the knowledge of\nBrahman being the universal Self the highest end of man is obtained. About\ndifference on the other hand mere occasional statements (anuvada) are made as\nabout something already established naturally (i.e. apart from scripture).\nMoreover, we have already maintained that Brahman as not composed of parts can\nhave no parts. Hence it follows that the one highest Self which is within all\nbeings appears as individual soul, and it therefore remains to show how\ninjunctions and prohibitions are possible.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[65:1](sbe38048.htm#fr_43) I.e. the subtle body consisting of the ten sense-\norgans, the five pra _n_ as, manas, and buddhi.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 48](sbe38049.htm)\n\n"
