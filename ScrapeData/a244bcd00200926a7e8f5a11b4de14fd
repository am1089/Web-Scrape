On both assumptions also there is no motion, and thence non-being (of the\norigination of the world).\n\nThe atomic theory teaches that the world is produced by the successive\nformation of compounds, binary, ternary, and so on, due to the aggregation of\natoms--such aggregation resulting from the motion of the atoms. The primary\nmotion of the atoms--which are the cause of the origination of the entire\nworld--is assumed to be brought about by the unseen principle (ad _ri_ sh _t_\na), 'The upward flickering of fire,the sideway motion of air, the primary\nmotion on the part\n\np. 497\n\nof atoms and of the manas are caused by the unseen principle.'--Is then, we\nask, this primary motion of the atoms caused by an ad _ri_ sh _t_ a residing\nin them, or by an ad _ri_ sh _t_ a residing in the souls? Neither alternative\nis possible. For the unseen principle which is originated by the good and evil\ndeeds of the individual souls cannot possibly reside in the atoms; and if it\ncould, the consequence would be that the atoms would constantly produce the\nworld. Nor again can the ad _ri_ sh _t_ a residing in the souls be the cause\nof motion originating in the atoms.--Let it then be assumed that motion\noriginates in the atoms, owing to their being in contact with the souls in\nwhich the ad _ri_ sh _t_ a abides!--If this were so, we reply, it would follow\nthat the world would be permanently created, for the ad _ri_ sh _t_ a, of the\nsouls forms an eternal stream.-But the ad _ri_ sh _t_ a requires to be matured\nin order to produce results. The ad _ri_ sh _t_ as of some souls come to\nmaturity in the same state of existence in which the deeds were performed;\nothers become mature in a subsequent state of existence only; and others again\ndo not become mature before a new Kalpa has begun. It is owing to this\ndependence on the maturation of the ad _ri_ sh _t_ as that the origination of\nthe world does not take place at all times.--But this reasoning also we cannot\nadmit. For there is nothing whatever to establish the conclusion that all the\ndifferent ad _ri_ sh _t_ as which spring from the manifold actions performed\nat different times, without any previous agreement, by the infinite multitude\nof individual Selfs should reach a state of uniform maturation at one and the\nsame moment of time (so as to give rise to a new creation). Nor does this view\nof yours account for the fact of the entire world being destroyed at the same\ntime, and remaining in a state of non-maturation for the period of a\ndviparardha.--Nor can you say that the motion of the atoms is due to their\nconjunction with (souls whose) ad _ri_ sh _t_ a possesses certain specific\nqualities imparted to them by the will of the Lord; for by mere inference the\nexistence of a Lord cannot be proved, as we have shown under I, 1. The origin\nof the world cannot, therefore, be due to any action on the part of the atoms.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 12.
