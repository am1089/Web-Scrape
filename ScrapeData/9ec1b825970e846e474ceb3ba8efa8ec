My speech rests in the mind, my mind rests in speech 3. Appear to me\n(thou, the Highest Self)! You (speech and mind) are the two pins 4 (that hold\nthe wheels) of the Veda. May what I have learnt not forsake me 5. I join day\nand night with what I have learnt 6. I shall speak of the real, I shall speak\nthe true. May this protect me, may this protect the teacher! May it protect\nme, may it protect the teacher, yea, the teacher!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[246:2](sbe01227.htm#fr_616) This seventh adhyaya contains a propitiatory\nprayer ( _s_ antikaro mantra _h_ ). It is frequently left out in the MSS.\nwhich contain the Aitareya-upanishad with _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's commentary, and Dr.\nRoer has omitted it in his edition. Saya _n_ a explains it in his commentary\non the Aitareya-aranyaka; and in one MS. of _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's commentary on the\nAitareya-upanishad, which is in my possession, the seventh adhyaya is added\nwith the commentary of Madhavamatya, the \xc3\x82 _g_ \xc3\xb1apalaka of Virabukka-mahara\n_g_ a.\n\n[246:3](sbe01227.htm#fr_617) The two depend on each other.\n\n[246:4](sbe01227.htm#fr_618) Ant, explained by the commentator as\nanayanasamartha.\n\n[246:5](sbe01227.htm#fr_619) Cf. _Kh_. Up. IV, 2, 5.\n\n[246:6](sbe01227.htm#fr_620) I repeat it day and night so that I may not\nforget it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 1, 1](sbe01228.htm)\n\n"
