That which possesses the qualities of invisibility, &c., on account of\nthe declaration of attributes.\n\nThe \xc3\x82tharva _n_ ikas read in their text, 'The higher knowledge is that by\nwhich that Indestructible is apprehended. That which is invisible, unseizable,\nwithout origin and qualities, &c., that it is which the wise regard as the\nsource of all beings'; and further on, 'That which is higher than the high\nImperishable' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 5, 6; II, 1, 2). The doubt here arises whether\nthe Indestructible, possessing the qualities of imperceptibility, &c., and\nthat which is higher than the Indestructible, should be taken to denote the\nPradhana and the soul of the Sa _n_ khyas, or whether both denote the highest\nSelf.--The Purvapakshin maintains the former alternative. For, he says, while\nin the text last discussed there is mentioned a special attribute of an\nintelligent being, viz. in the clause 'unseen but a seer', no similar\nattribute is stated in the former of the two texts under discussion, and the\nlatter text clearly describes the collective individual soul, which is higher\nthan the imperishable Pradhana, which itself is higher than all its effects.\nThe reasons for this decision are as follows:--Colour and so on reside in the\ngross forms of non-intelligent matter, viz. the elements, earth, and so on.\nWhen, therefore, visibility and so on are expressly negatived, such negation\nsuggests a non-sentient thing cognate to earth, &c., but of a subtle kind, and\nsuch a thing is no other than the Pradhana. And as something higher than this\nPradhana there are known the collective souls only, under whose guidance the\nPradhana gives birth to all its effects, from the so-called Mahat downwards\n\np. 283\n\nto individual things. This interpretation is confirmed by the comparisons set\nforth in the next _s_ loka, 'As the spider sends forth and draws in its\nthreads, as plants spring from the earth, as hair grows on the head and body\nof the living man, thus does everything arise here from the Indestructible.'\nThe section therefore is concerned only with the Pradhana and the individual\nsoul.\n\nThis prima facie view is set aside by the Sutra. That which possesses\ninvisibility and the other qualities stated in the text, and that which is\nhigher than the high Indestructible, is no other than the highest Self. For\nthe text declares attributes which belong to the highest Self only, viz. in I,\n1, 9, 'He who knows all, cognises all,' &c. Let us shortly consider the\nconnexion of the text. The passage beginning'the higher knowledge is that by\nwhich the Indestructible is apprehended' declares an indestructible being\npossessing the attributes of invisibility and so on. The clause 'everything\narises here from the Indestructible' next declares that from that being all\nthings originate. Next the _s_ loka, 'He who knows all and cognises all,'\npredicates of that Indestructible which is the source of all beings,\nomniscience, and similar qualities. And finally the text, 'That which is\nhigher than the high Indestructible,' characterises that same being--which\npreviously had been called invisible, the source of beings, indestructible,\nall-knowing, &c.--as the highest of all. Hence it is evident that in the text\n'higher than the high Indestructible' the term 'Indestructible' does not\ndenote the invisible, &c. Indestructible, which is the chief topic of the\nentire section; for there can of course be nothing higher than that which, as\nbeing all-knowing, the source of all, &c., is itself higher than anything\nelse. The 'Indestructible' in that text therefore denotes the elements in\ntheir subtle condition.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 23.
