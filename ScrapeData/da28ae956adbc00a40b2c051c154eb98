And (having done so) eat what is left.\n\n2\\. For this (remnant of food) is certainly a remnant of sacrificial food.\n\nIf he obtains other things (besides food, such as cattle or fuel, and gives\nthem to his teacher) as he obtains them, then those (things hold the place of)\nrewards (given to priests for the performance of a sacrifice).\n\n4\\. This is the sacrifice to be performed daily by a religious student.\n\n5\\. And (the teacher) shall not give him anything that is forbidden by the\nrevealed texts, (not even as) leavings,\n\n6\\. Such as pungent condiments, salt, honey, or meat (and the like). 6\n\np. 15\n\n7\\. By this (last Sutra it is) explained (that) the other restrictions\n(imposed upon a student, such as abstinence from perfumes, ointments, &c., are\nlikewise not to be broken). 7\n\n8\\. For (explicit) revealed texts have greater force than custom from which\n(the existence of a permissive passage of the revelation) may be inferred. 8\n\n9\\. Besides (in this particular case) a (worldly) motive for the practice is\napparent. 9\n\np. 16\n\n10\\. For pleasure is obtained (by eating or using the forbidden substances).\n10\n\n11\\. A residue of food left by a father and an elder brother, may be eaten.\n\n12\\. If they act contrary to the law, he must not eat (their leavings). 12\n\n13\\. In the evening and in the morning he shall fetch water in a vessel (for\nthe use of his teacher). 13\n\n14\\. Daily he shall fetch fuel from the forest, and place it on the floor (in\nhis teacher\'s house). 14\n\n15\\. He shall not go to fetch firewood after sunset.\n\n16\\. After having kindled the fire, and having swept the ground around (the\naltar), he shall place 16\n\np. 17\n\nthe sacred fuel on the fire every morning and evening, according to the\nprescription (of the G _ri_ hya-sutra).\n\n17\\. Some say that the fire is only to be worshipped in the evening.\n\n18\\. He shall sweep the place around the fire after it has been made to burn\n(by the addition of fuel), with his hand, and not with the broom (of Ku _s_ a\ngrass). 18\n\n19\\. But, before (adding the fuel, he is free to use the broom) at his\npleasure\n\n20\\. He shall not perform non-religious acts with the residue of the water\nemployed for the fire-worship, nor sip it. 20\n\n21\\. He shall not sip water which has been stirred with the hand, nor such as\nhas been received into one hand only.\n\n22\\. And he shall avoid sleep (whilst his teacher is awake).\n\n23\\. Then (after having risen) he shall assist his teacher daily by acts\ntending to the acquisition of spiritual merit and of wealth. 23\n\n24\\. Having served (his teacher during the day in this manner, he shall say\nwhen going to bed): I have protected the protector of the law (my teacher). 24\n\np. 18\n\n25\\. If the teacher transgresses the law through carelessness or knowingly, he\nshall point it out to him privately.\n\n26\\. If (the teacher) does not cease (to transgress), he himself shall perform\nthe religious acts (which ought to be performed by the former); 26\n\n27\\. Or he may return home.\n\n28\\. Now of him who rises before (his teacher) and goes to rest after (him),\nthey say that he does not sleep.\n\n29\\. The student who thus entirely fixes his mind there (in the teacher\'s\nfamily), has thereby performed all acts which yield rewards (such as the _G_\nyotish _t_ oma), and also those which must be performed by a householder. 29\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[14:6](sbe0207.htm#fr_171) **4**. See above, I, 1, 2, 23.\n\n[15:7](sbe0207.htm#fr_172) See above, I, 1, 2, 24 seq.:--According to\nHaradatta, teachers were in the habit of giving ointments and the like\nforbidden substances to their pupils, and \xc3\x82pastamba gives this rule in order\nto show his dissent from the practice.\n\n[15:8](sbe0207.htm#fr_173) \'\xc3\x82numanika\' means "proper to be inferred from." For\nthe existence of a text of the revelation or tradition (Sm _ri_ ti) is\ninferred from custom. A visible text of the revelation is (however) of greater\nweight than a custom from which the existence of a text may be inferred. It is\nimpossible to infer (the existence of a text) which is opposed to such (a\nvisible text), on account of the maxim "an inference (can be made only, if it\nis) not opposed (by ocular proof)." (\xc3\x82pastamba), by speaking thus, ("For\nrevealed texts," &c.,) shows that the rule forbidding a student to eat pungent\ncondiments, salt &c. is based on the existing text of a Brahma _n_ a.\'\n--Haradatta.\n\n[15:9](sbe0207.htm#fr_174) \'Though the text forbidding the use of pungent\ncondiments salt, and the like refers to such substances if they are not\nleavings, still it is improper to assert, on the ground of the custom from\nwhich a permissive text may be inferred, that it (the existing text), which is\ngeneral, must be restricted (to those cases only) where the forbidden\nsubstances are not leavings given by the teacher. (If an opponent should\nanswer that) certainly there are also texts which contradict each other, such\nas "he takes" and "he does not take," and that therefore there is no reason\nwhy a text restricted (to the case in which forbidden substances are leavings\nof the teacher) should not be inferred. In order to answer (that plea), he\n(\xc3\x82pastamba) says (Sutra 9), "True, that would be right if no motive whatever\ncould be discovered for that custom (to eat forbidden food which is given by\nthe teacher). But a reason for this course of action exists."\'--Haradatta.\n\n[16:10](sbe0207.htm#fr_175) \'What is that (reason)? [Sutra 10] For to eat\npungent condiments, salt, &c. gives pleasure to the eater, and therefore\naccording to the maxim, I, 4, 12, 11, "That in case a custom has pleasure for\nits motive, there is no text of the holy law to authorise it," no text\nrestricting (the prohibition of forbidden substances to the case in which a\nBrahma _k_ arin does not receive them as leavings from his teacher) can be\ninferred (from the practice of eating such leavings).\'--Haradatta.\n\n[16:12](sbe0207.htm#fr_176) Another explanation of this Sutra is given by\nHaradatta: \'If by eating their leavings he should commit a sin (because the\nfood contains salt &c.), he shall not do it.\'\n\n[16:13](sbe0207.htm#fr_177) Manu II, 182.\n\n[16:14](sbe0207.htm#fr_178) The reason for placing the fuel on the ground is,\naccording to Haradatta, the fear lest, if placed on some shelf or the like, it\nshould tumble down and injure the teacher\'s children. Others however, are of\nopinion that the wood which the pupil fetches daily, is not to be used by the\nteacher for cooking, but for the performance of the pupil\'s daily fire-\noffering. The reason for this interpretation is, that in the G _ri_ hya-sutra,\nII, 24, the daily offering of fuel is enjoined with the same words. See Weber,\nInd. Stud. X, 123; Manu II, 186.\n\n[16:16](sbe0207.htm#fr_179) Some explain, instead of \'after having swept the\nground around the altar,\' &c., \'after having raked the scattered brands into a\nheap.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[17:18](sbe0207.htm#fr_180) \xc3\x82p. G _ri_. Su. II, 22.\n\n[17:20](sbe0207.htm#fr_181) During the fire-worship water is wanted for\nsprinkling the altar in various ways.\n\n[17:23](sbe0207.htm#fr_182) Acts tending to the acquisition of merit are here\n--collecting sacred fuel, Ku _s_ a grass, and flowers for sacrifices. Acts\ntending to the acquisition of wealth are--gathering fuel for cooking, &c. Manu\nII, 182; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 123 and 124.\n\n[17:24](sbe0207.htm#fr_183) Another explanation of the words spoken by the\nstudent is, \'O law, I have protected him; protect thou me.\' See also Gopatha-\nbrahma _n_ a, 1, 2, 4.\n\n[18:26](sbe0207.htm#fr_184) Compare above, I, 1, 1, 13.\n\n[18:29](sbe0207.htm#fr_185) The Sutra refers to a naish _th_ ika brahma _k_\narin or professed student, who never leaves his teacher\'s family, and never\nenters any other order; and it declares his merit to be equal to that of one\nwho becomes a householder. Manu II, 243, 244; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. I, 49, 50.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na I, Pa _t_ ala 2, Kha _n_ _d_ a 5](sbe0208.htm)\n\n'
