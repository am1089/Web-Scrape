Prayer to Trishamdhi for help in battle.\n\n1\\. Arise and arm yourselves, ye nebulous spectres together with fiery\nportents; ye serpents, other brood, and Rakshas, run ye after the enemy!  \n2\\. He knows bow to rule your kingdom together with the red portents (of the\nheavens). The evil brood that is in the air and the heaven, and the human\n(powers) upon the earth, shall be obedient to the plans of Trishamdhi!  \n3\\. The brazen-beaked (birds of prey), those with beaks pointed as a needle,\nand those, too, with thorny beaks, flesh-devouring, swift as the wind, shall\nfasten themselves upon the enemies, together with the Trishamdhi-bolt (the\nbolt with three joints)!  \n4\\. Make away with, O Gatavedas \xc3\x82ditya, many carcasses! This army of\nTrishamdhi shall be devoted to my bidding!  \n5\\. Arise thou divine person, O Arbudi, together with thy army! This tribute\nhas been offered to you (Arbudi and Trishamdhi), an offerinor pleasing to\nTrishamdhi.  \n6\\. This white-footed, four-footed arrow shall fetter (?). Do thou, O magic\nspell, operate, together with the army of Trishamdhi, against the enemies!  \n7\\. May (the mourning woman) with suffused eyes hurry on, may she that hath\nshort (mutilated?) ears shout when (a man) has been overcome by the army of\nTrishamdhi! Red portents shall be (visible)!  \n8\\. May the winged birds that move in the air and in the sky descend; beasts\nof prey and insects shall seize upon them; the vultures that feed upon raw\nflesh shall hack into (their) carcasses!  \n9\\. By virtue of the compact which thou, O Brihaspati, didst close with Indra\nand Brahman, by virtue of that agreement with Indra, do I call hither all the\ngods: on this side conquer, not over yonder!  \n10\\. Brihaspati, the descendant of Angiras, and the seers, inspired by (our)\nsong, did fix the three-jointed (Trishamdhi) weapon upon the sky for the\ndestruction of the Asuras.  \n11\\. Trishamdhi, by whom both yonder \xc3\x82ditya (the sun) and Indra, are\nprotected, the gods did destine for (our) might and strencth.  \n12\\. All the worlds the gods did conquer through this oblation, (and) by the\nbolt which Brihaspati, the descendant of Angiras, did mould into a weapon for\nthe destruction of the Asuras.  \n13\\. With the bolt which Brihaspati, the descendant of Angiras, did, mould\ninto a weapon for the destruction of the Asuras do I, O Brihaspati, annihilate\nyonder army: I smite the enemies with force.  \n14\\. All the gods that eat the oblation offered with the call vashat are\ncoming over. Receive this oblation graciously; conquer on this side, not over\nyonder!  \n15\\. May all the gods come over: the oblation is pleasing to Trishamdhi.\nAdhere to the great compact under which of yore the Asuras were conquered!  \n16\\. Vayu (the wind) shall bend the points of the enemies' bows, Indra shall\nbreak their arms, so that they shall be unable to lay on their arrows, \xc3\x82ditya\n(the sun) shall send their missiles astray, and Kandramas (the moon) shall bar\nthe way of (the enemy) that has not (as yet) started!  \n17\\. If they have come on as citadels of the gods, if they have constituted an\ninspired charm as their armour, if they have gathered courage through the\nprotections for the body and the bulwarks which they have made, render all\nthat devoid of force!  \n18\\. Placing (our) purohita (chaplain), together with the flesh-devourer\n(Agni) and death, in thy train, do thoti, O Trishamdhi, go forth with thy\narmy, conquer the enemies, advance!  \n19\\. O Trishamdhi, envelop thou the enemies in darkness; may not a single one\nof those, driven forth by the speckled ghee, be saved!  \n20\\. May the white-footed (arrow?) fly to yonder lines of the enemy, may\nyonder armies of the enemies be to-day put to confusion, O Nyarbudi!  \n21\\. The enemies have been confused, O Nyarbudi: slay each picked man among\nthem, slay them with this army!  \n22\\. The enemy with coat-of-mail, he that has no coat-of-mail, and he that\nstands in the battle-throng, throttled by the strings of their bows, by the\nfastenings of their coats-of-mail, by the battle-throng, they shall lie!  \n23\\. Those w ith armour and those without armour, the enemies that are\nshielded by armour, all those, O Arbudi, after they have been slain, dogs\nshall devour upon the ground!  \n24\\. Those that ride on chariots, and those that have no chariots, those that\nare mounted, and those that are not mounted, all those, after they have been\nslain, vultures and strong-winged hawks shall devour!  \n25\\. Counting its dead by thousands, the hostile army, pierced and shattered\nin the clash of arms, shall lie!  \n26\\. Pierced in a vital spot, shrieking in concert with the birds of prey,\nwretched, crushed, prostrate, (the birds of prey) shall devour the enemy who\nattempts to hinder this oblation of ours directed against (him)!  \n27\\. With (the oblation) to which the gods flock, which is free from\nfailure,-with it Indra, the slayer of Vritra, shall slay, and with the\nTrishamdhi-bolt (the bolt with three joints)!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 20.
