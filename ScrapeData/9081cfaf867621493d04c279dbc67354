And the pairs of the life-winds should be understood, which\n(move) upwards, or downwards, or transversely.\n\np. 275\n\nDevamata said:\n\nBy which (of the life-winds) is a creature produced? and which (of them) first\ncomes to him? Explain to me also the pairs of the life-winds, which (move)\nupwards, or downwards, or transversely.\n\nNarada said:\n\nPleasure is produced from a mental operation 1, and (it) is also produced from\na sound, (it) is also produced from taste, and (it) is also produced from\ncolour, and (it) is also produced from touch, and (it) is also produced from\nsmell. This is the effect 2 of the Udana; the pleasure is produced from union\n3. From desire the semen is produced; and from the semen is produced menstrual\nexcretion. The semen and the blood are produced by the Samana and the Vyana in\ncommon 4. From the combination of the semen and the blood, the Pra _n_ a comes\nfirst into operation; and the semen being developed by the Pra _n_ a, the\nApana then comes into operation. The pair Pra _n_ a and Apana go upwards and\ndownwards, and the Samana and Vyana are called the pair (moving) transversely.\nIt is the teaching of the\n\np. 276\n\n[paragraph continues] Veda, that the fire verily is all the deities 1, and\nknowledge (of it) arises among Brahma _n_ as, being accompanied by\nintelligence 2. The smoke of that (fire), which is of excellent glory,\n(appears) in the shape of (the quality of) darkness; (its) ashes, (the quality\nof) passion; and (the quality of) goodness is that in connexion with it 3, in\nwhich the offering is thrown. Those who understand the sacrifice understand\nthe Samana and the Vyana as the principal (offering). The Pra _n_ a and Apana\nare portions 4 of the offering of clarified butter, and between them is the\nfire. That is the excellent seat of the Udana as understood by Brahma _n_ as 5\nAs to that which is distinct from these pairs 6, hear me speak about\n\np. 277\n\nthat. Day and night are a pair, between them is the fire. That is the\nexcellent seat of the Udana as understood by Brahma _n_ as. That which exists\nand that which does not exist are a pair, between them is the fire. That is\nthe excellent seat of the Udana as understood by Brahma _n_ as. The two--good\nand evil--:are a pair, between them is the fire. That is the excellent seat of\nthe Udana as understood by Brahma _n_ as. First [1](sbe0837.htm#fn_1318), the\nSamana and Vyana, their function [2](sbe0837.htm#fn_1319) is performed: then,\nsecondly, the Samana comes into operation again. Then the Vamadevya\n[3](sbe0837.htm#fn_1320) for tranquillity, and tranquillity is the eternal\nBrahman. This is the excellent seat of the Udana as understood by Brahma _n_\nas.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[274:1](sbe0835.htm#fr_1310) This is not quite clear. I presume it means that\neach one has the generic qualities which make the others great in their own\nspheres; but the specific qualities are different.\n\n[274:2](sbe0835.htm#fr_1311) The one life-wind is supposed, here to be\ngenerally unmoving, but its distribution among the different parts of the body\nas specified, for instance, in the commentary on the Yoga-sutra III, 38, gives\nit the different names. The expression does not seem to be quite accurate for\nthis, which nevertheless seems to be the true, sense.\n\n[274:3](sbe0835.htm#fr_1312) Another reading is, 'That one is my own self.'\nCf. Maitri, pp. 28 seq., 105, and B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka p. 169.\n\n[275:1](sbe0836.htm#fr_1313) I. e. desire. 'Sound' = recollection of a woman's\nvoice; taste,' scil. of chastity; 'colour' = the beauty of a woman, Ar _g_ una\nMi _s_ ra Cf. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 7, 8, and Lalita Vistara, p. 19.\n\n[275:2](sbe0836.htm#fr_1314) Literally, 'form,' which Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra\ninterprets to mean effect, and adds, 'The Udana causes mental activity, and by\nmental activity sound &c. are apprehended.'\n\n[275:3](sbe0836.htm#fr_1315) I. e. of Udana and mind, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra;\nadding, 'the result is that a creature is produced by the Udana.'\n\n[275:4](sbe0836.htm#fr_1316) Or, perhaps, generally, that is to say, the store\nof them, the specific semen being produced from desire, as before stated. The\nSamana's function is the digestion of food, and that of the Vyana is the\ndistribution of the digested food to the whole body through the na _d_ is,\nhence the proposition in the text.\n\n[276:1](sbe0836.htm#fr_1317) Cf. inter alia, Aitareya-brahma _n_ a (Haug's\ned.), p. 1.\n\n[276:2](sbe0836.htm#fr_1318) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says intelligence means\n'discussion, or argument.' The connexion of this with what has gone before,\naccording to Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra, is this, that the author having first\nstated the five Hot _ri_ s fully, now explains in what the Pra _n_ a and Apana\nare to be offered up for acquiring the Pra _n_ ayama. The fire he takes to\nmean the self. Cf. what has been said about Vaisvanara above, [p.\n259](sbe0832.htm#page_259).\n\n[276:3](sbe0836.htm#fr_1319) That is to say, the flame, 'take it. 'He is\ndrawing out here the figure of the fire.\n\n[276:4](sbe0836.htm#fr_1320) These are only a subordinate part of the\noffering, called \xc3\x82 _g_ yabhaga. They are called subordinate, I suppose, as the\noperations of the Samana and Vyana are more practically important for\nvitality. The fire is the self. The place of the principal offering is between\nthe \xc3\x82 _g_ yabhagas, as stated by Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra.\n\n[276:5](sbe0836.htm#fr_1321) The Udana is here treated as the life-wind into\nwhich the others are to be offered up. See [p. 258](sbe0832.htm#page_258), and\nnote  [8](sbe0832.htm#fn_1232) there.\n\n[276:6](sbe0836.htm#fr_1322) The next three sentences seem to indicate what is\nto be destroyed in common with the life-winds. One has to get rid of all\nnotions about day and night, good and evil, existence and non-existence, and\nthen final emancipation is reached. The fire, which is common to all the\npassages, stands for the self; into that apparently all the ideas of time, and\ngood and evil, and so forth, are to be offered as the life-winds are; and that\nfire stands in the place of p. 277 the Udana, for this purpose, as into the\nlast all the other life-winds have to be offered. As to that which exists,\n&c., cf. Gita, [p. 103](sbe0815.htm#page_103), and [p.\n370](sbe0859.htm#page_370), note  [9](sbe0859.htm#fn_1909) infra. As to good\nand evil and generally, cf. _Kh_ andogya, p. 60; Kaushitaki, p. 19. They are\nnothing to one who knows the Brahman. Day and night Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra takes\nto mean the I _d_ a and Pi _n_ gala na _d_ is, between which is the Sushum _n_\na, as they are connected with the sun and moon. But the sense of the whole\npassage is far from clear.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter X](sbe0837.htm)\n\n"
