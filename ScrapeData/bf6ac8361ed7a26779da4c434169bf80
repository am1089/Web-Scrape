And there is permission of all food in the case of danger of life; on\naccount of this being seen.\n\nIn the meditation on pra _n_ a, according to the Va _g_ asaneyins and the _Kh_\nandogas, there is a statement as to all food being allowed to him who knows\nthe pra _n_ a. 'By him there is nothing eaten that is not food' (B _ri_. Up.\nVI, 1, 14; and so on). A doubt here arises whether this permission of all food\nis valid for him who possesses the knowledge of pra _n_ a, in all\ncircumstances, or only in the case of life being in danger.--The Purvapakshin\nholds the former view, on account of no special conditions being stated in the\ntext.--This the Sutra sets aside 'in the case of danger to life'; for the\nreason that, as the text shows, the eating of food of all kinds is permitted\neven for those who know Brahman itself--the knowledge of which of course is\nhigher than that of pra _n_ a--only when their life is in danger. The text\nalluded to is the one telling how Ushasta _K_ akraya _n_ a, who was well\nversed in the knowledge of Brahman, once, when in great distress, ate unlawful\nfood. We therefore conclude that what the text says as to all food being\nlawful for him who knows pra _n_ a, can refer only to occasions when food of\nany kind must be eaten in order to preserve life.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 29.
