But having destroyed by fruition the two other (sets of work) he becomes\none with Brahman.\n\nIt has been shown that all good and evil deeds whose effects have not yet\nbegun are extinguished by the power of knowledge. 'The two others,' on the\nother hand, i.e. those good and evil works whose effects have begun, a man\n\np. 363\n\nhas at first to exhaust by the fruition of their consequences, and then he\nbecomes one with Brahman. This appears from scriptural passages such as 'For\nhim there is delay so long as he is not delivered (from the body), then he\nwill become one with Brahman'( _Kh_. Up. VI, 14, 2); and 'Being Brahman he\ngoes to Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 6).--But, an objection is raised, even\nwhen perfect intuition has risen the practical intuition of multiplicity may\ncontinue after the death of the body, just as it continued before death;\nanalogously to the visual appearance of a double moon (which may continue even\nafter it has been cognized as false).--Not so, we reply. After the death of\nthe body there no longer exists any cause for such continuance; while up to\ndeath there is such a cause, viz. the extinction of the remainder of works to\nbe enjoyed.--But a new aggregate of works will originate a new fruition!--Not\nso, we reply; since the seed of all such fruition is destroyed. What, on the\ndeath of the body, could originate a new period of fruition, is only a new set\nof works, and works depend on false knowledge; but such false knowledge is\ncompletely destroyed by perfect intuition. When therefore the works whose\neffects have begun are destroyed, the man who knows necessarily enters into\nthe state of perfect isolation.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2, 1](sbe38281.htm)\n\n"
