Because the unperceived goal 2 is obtained by embodied (beings) with\ndifficulty. As to those, however, O son of P _ri_ tha! who, dedicating all\ntheir actions to me, and (holding) me as their highest (goal), worship me,\nmeditating on me with a devotion towards none besides me, and whose minds are\nfixed on me, I, Without delay, come forward as their deliverer from the ocean\nof this world of death. Place your mind on me only; fix your understanding on\nme. In me you will dwell 3 hereafter, (there is) no doubt. But if you are\nunable to fix your mind steadily on me, then, O Dhana\xc3\xb1 _g_ aya! endeavour 4 to\nobtain me by the abstraction of mind (resulting) from continuous meditation 5.\nIf you are unequal even to continuous meditation, then let acts for\n(propitiating) me be your highest (aim). Even performing actions for\n(propitiating) me, you will attain perfection. If you are unable to do even\nthis, then resort to devotion 6 to me, and, with self-restraint, abandon all\nfruit of action. For knowledge is better than continuous meditation;\nconcentration 7 is esteemed higher\n\np. 101\n\nthan knowledge; and the abandonment of fruit of action than concentration;\nfrom (that) abandonment, tranquillity soon (results). That devotee of mine,\nwho hates no being, who is friendly and compassionate, who is free from\negoism, and from (the idea that this or that is) mine, to whom happiness and\nmisery are alike, who is forgiving, contented, constantly devoted, self-\nrestrained, and firm in his determinations, and whose mind and understanding\nare devoted to me, he is dear to me. He through whom the world is not agitated\n1, and who is not agitated by the world, who is free from joy and anger and\nfear and agitation, he too is dear to me. That devotee of mine, who is\nunconcerned 2, pure, assiduous 3, impartial, free from distress 4, who\nabandons all actions (for fruit 5), he is dear to me. He who is full of\ndevotion to me, who feels no joy and no aversion, who does not grieve and does\nnot desire, who abandons (both what is) agreeable and (what is) disagreeable,\nhe is dear to me. He who is alike to friend and foe, as also in honour and\ndishonour, who is alike in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, who is free from\nattachments, to whom praise and blame are alike, who is taciturn 6, and\ncontented with anything whatever (that comes), who is homeless 7, and of a\nsteady mind, and full of devotion,\n\np. 102\n\nthat man is dear to me. But those devotees who, imbued with faith, and\n(regarding) me as their highest (goal), resort to this holy (means for\nattaining) immortality, as stated, they are extremely dear to me.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[99:1](sbe0813.htm#fr_403) Literally, 'entered into;' it means final\nemancipation.
