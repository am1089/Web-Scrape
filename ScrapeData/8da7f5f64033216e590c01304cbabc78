 \nA thing the timid heart that shook  \nWith fearful shape and savage look.  \nTerrific fiend, her voice was fierce,  \nLong were her teeth to rend and pierce.  \nThe monster gorged her horrid feast  \nOf flesh of many a savage beast,  \nWhile her long locks, at random flung,  \nDishevelled o'er her shoulders hung.  \nTheir eyes the royal brothers raised,  \nAnd on the fearful monster gazed.  \nForth from her den she came and glanced  \nAt Lakshman as he first advanced,  \nHer eager arms to hold him spread,  \nAnd 'Come and be my love' she said,  \nThen as she held him to her breast,  \nThe prince in words like these addressed:  \n'Behold thy treasure fond and fair:  \nAyomukhi  2 the name I bear.  \n\np. 311  \n\nIn thickets of each lofty hill,  \nOn islets of each brook and rill,  \nWith me delighted shalt thou play,  \nAnd live for many a lengthened day.'  \n   Enraged he heard the monster woo;  \nHis ready sword he swiftly drew,  \nAnd the sharp steel that quelled his foes  \nCut through her breast and ear and nose.  \nThus mangled by his vengeful sword  \nIn rage and pain the demon roared,  \nAnd hideous with her awful face  \nSped to her secret dwelling place.  \nSoon as the fiend had fled from sight,  \nThe brothers, dauntless in their might,  \nBeached a wild forest dark and dread  \nWhose tangled ways were hard to tread.  \nThen bravest Lakshman, virtuous youth,  \nThe friend of purity and truth,  \nWith reverent palm to palm applied  \nThus to his glorious brother cried:  \n   'My arm presaging throbs amain,  \nMy troubled heart is sick with pain,  \nAnd cheerless omens ill portend  \nWhere'er my anxious eyes I bend.  \nDear brother, hear my words: advance  \nResolved and armed for every chance,  \nFor every sign I mark to-day  \nForetells a peril in the way.  \nThis bird of most ill-omened note,  \nLoud streaming with discordant throat,  \nAnnounces with a warning cry  \nThat strife and victory are nigh.'  \n   Then as the chiefs their search pursued  \nThroughout the dreary solitude,  \nThey heard amazed a mighty sound  \nThat broke the very trees around.  \nAs though a furious tempest passed  \nCrashing the wood beneath its blast.  \nThen Rama raised his trusty sword,  \nAnd both the hidden cause explored.  \nThere stood before their wondering eyes  \nA fiend broad-chested, huge of size.  \nA vast misshapen trunk they saw  \nIn height surpassing nature's law.  \nIt stood before them dire and dread  \nWithout a neck, without a head.  \nTall as some hill aloft in air,  \nIts limbs were clothed with bristling hair,  \nAnd deep below the monster's waist  \nHis vast misshapen mouth was placed.  \nHis form was huge, his voice was loud  \nAs some dark-tinted thunder cloud,  \nForth from his ample chest there came  \nA brilliance as of gushing flame.  \nBeneath long lashes, dark and keen  \nThe monster's single eye was seen.  \nDeep in his chest, long, fiercely bright,  \nIt glittered with terrific light.  \nHe swallowed down his savage fare  \nOf lion, bird, and slaughtered bear,  \nAud with huge teeth exposed to view  \n\nO'er his great lips his tongue he drew.  \nHis arms unshapely, vast and dread,  \nA league in length, he raised and spread.  \nHe seized with monstrous hands a herd  \nOf deer and many a bear and bird.  \nAmong them all he picked and chose,  \nDrew forward these, rejected those.  \nBefore the princely pair he stood  \nBarring their passage through the wood.  \nA league of shade the chiefs had passed  \nWhen on the fiend their eyes they cast.  \nA monstrous shape without a head  \nWith mighty arms before him spread,  \nThey saw that hideous trunk appear  \nThat struck the trembling eye with fear.  \nThen, stretching to their full extent  \nHis awful arms with fingers bent,  \nBound Raghu's princely sons he cast  \nEach grasping limb and held them fast.  \nThough strong of arm and fierce in fight,  \nEach armed with bow and sword to smite,  \nThe royal brothers, brave and bold,  \nWere helpless in the giant's hold.  \nThen Raghu's son, heroic still,  \nFelt not a pang his bosom thrill;  \nBut young, with no protection near,  \nHis brother's heart was sad with fear,  \nAnd thus with trembling tongue he said  \nTo Rama, sore disquieted:  \n   'Ah me, ah me, my days are told:  \nO see me in the giant's hold.  \nFly, son of Raghu, swiftly flee,  \nAnd thy dear self from danger free.  \nMe to the fiend an offering give;  \nFly at thine ease thyself and live.  \nThou, great Katkutstha's son, I ween,  \nWilt find ere long thy Maithil queen,  \nAnd when thou holdest, throned again,  \nThine old hereditary reign,  \nWith servants prompt to do thy will,  \nO think upon thy brother still.'  \nAs thus the trembling Lakshman cried,  \nThe dauntless Rama thus replied:  \n'Brother, from causeless dread forbear.  \nA chief like thee should scorn despair.'  \nHe spoke to soothe his wild alarm:  \nThen fierce Kabandha  1 long of arm,  \nAmong the Danavs  2 first and best,  \nThe sons of Raghu thus addressed:  \n'What men are you, whose shoulders show  \nBroad as a bull's, with sword and bow,  \nWho roam this dark and horrid place.  \nBrought by your fate before my face?  \nDeclare by what occasion led  \nThese solitary wilds you tread,  \nWith swords and bows and shafts to pierce,  \n\np. 312  \n\nLike bulls whose horns are strong and fierce.  \nWhy have you sought this forest land  \nWhere wild with hunger's pangs I stand?  \nNow as your steps my path have crossed  \nEsteem your lives already lost?  \n   The royal brothers heard with dread  \nThe words which fierce Kabandha said.  \nAnd Rama to his brother cried,  \nWhose cheek by blanching fear was dried.  \n   'Alas, we fall, O valiant chief,  \nFrom sorrow into direr grief,  \nStill mourning her I hold so dear  \nWe see our own destruction near.  \nMark, brother, mark what power has time  \nO'er all that live, in every chime  \nNow, lord of men, thyself and me  \nInvolved in fatal danger see.  \n'Tis not, be sure, the might of Fate  \nThat crushes all with deadly weight.  \nNe'er can the brave and strong, who know  \nThe use of spear and sword and bow,  \nThe force of conquering time withstand,  \nBut fall like barriers built of sand.  \n   Thus in calm strength which naught could shake  \nThe son of Das'aratha spake,  \n   With glory yet unstained  \nUpon Sumitra's son he bent  \nHis eyes, and firm in his intent  \n   His dauntless heart maintained.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[310:1](ry268.htm#fr_516) Or Curlews' Wood.\n\n[310:2](ry268.htm#fr_517) Iron-faced.\n\n[311:1](ry268.htm#fr_518) Kabandha means a trunk.\n\n[311:2](ry268.htm#fr_519) A class of mythological giants.
