Formula in expiation of the birth of twin-calves.\n\n1\\. Through one creation at a time this (cow) was born, when the fashioners of\nthe beings did create the cows of many colours. (Therefore), when a cow doth\nbeget twins portentously, growling and cross she injureth the cattle.  \n2\\. This (cow) doth injure our cattle: a flesh-eater, devourer, she hath\nbecome. Hence to a Brahman he shall give her; in this way she may be kindly\nand auspicious!  \n3\\. Auspicious be to (our) men, auspicious to (our) cows and horses,\nauspicious to this entire field, auspicious be to us right here!  \n4\\. Here be prosperity, licre be sap! Be thou here one that especially gives a\nthousandfold! Make the cattle prosper, thou mother of twins!  \n5\\. Where our pious friends live joyously, having left behind the ailments of\ntheir bodies, to that world the mother of twins did attain: may she not injure\nour men and our cattle!  \n6\\. Where is the world of our pious friends, where the world of thern that\nsacrifice with the agnihotra, to that world the mother of twins did attain:\nmay she not injure our imen and our cattle!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 92.
