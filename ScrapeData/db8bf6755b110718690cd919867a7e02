One day the\nJackal said to the Camel, 'I know that there is a fine field of sugar-cane on\nthe other side of the river. If you will take me across I'll show you the\nplace. This plan will suit me as well as you. You will enjoy eating the sugar-\ncane, and I am sure to find many crabs, bones, and bits of fish by the river-\nside, on which to make a good dinner.'\n\nThe Camel consented, and swam across the river, taking the Jackal, who could\nnot swim, on his back. When they reached the other side, the Camel went to eat\nthe sugar-cane, and the Jackal ran up and down the river-bank devouring all\nthe crabs, bits of fish, and bones he could find.\n\nBut being so much smaller an animal, he bad made an excellent meal before the\nCamel had eaten more than two or three mouthfuls; and no sooner had he\nfinished his dinner, than he ran round and round the sugar-cane field, yelping\nand howling with all his might\n\nThe villagers heard him, and thought, 'There is a Jackal among the sugar-\ncanes; he will be scratching holes in the ground, and spoiling the roots of\nthe plants.' And they went down to the place to drive him away. But when they\ngot there, they found to their surprise not only a Jackal, but a Camel who was\neating the sugar-canes! This made them very angry, and they caught the poor\nCamel, and drove him from the field, and beat him until he was nearly dead.\n\nWhen they had gone, the Jackal said to the Camel, 'We had better go home.' And\nthe Camel said, 'Very well, then, jump upon my back as you did before.'\n\nSo the Jackal jumped upon the Camel's back, and the Camel began to recross the\nriver. When they had got well into the water, the Camel said, 'This is a\npretty way in which you have treated me, friend Jackal. No sooner had you\nfinished your own dinner than you must go yelping about the place loud enough\nto arouse the whole village, and bring all the villagers down to beat me black\nand blue, and turn me out of the field before I had eaten two mouthfuls! What\nin the world did you make such a noise for?'\n\n'I don't know,' said the Jackal 'It is a custom I have. I always like to sing\na little after dinner.'\n\nThe Camel waded on through the river. The water reached up to his knees--then\nabove them--up, up, up, higher and higher, until he was obliged to swim. Then\nturning to the Jackal, he said, 'I feel very anxious to roll.' 'Oh, pray\ndon't; why do you wish to do so? asked the Jackal. 'I don't know,' answered\nthe Camel: 'it is a custom I have. I always like to have a little roll after\ndinner.' So saying, he rolled over in the water, shaking the Jackal off as he\ndid so. And the Jackal was drowned, but the Camel swam safely ashore.\n\n![](img/29.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIV.
