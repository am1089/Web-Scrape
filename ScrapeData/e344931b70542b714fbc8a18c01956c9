Then Uma's lord,  3b  \nKing of creation, world adored,  \nThus spoke to great Bhagirath: 'I  \nWell pleased thy wish will gratify,  \nAnd on my head her waves shalll fling  \nThe daughter of the Mountains' King!  \nHe stood upon the lofty crest  \n   That crowns the Lord of Snow,  \nAnd bade the river of the Blest  \n   Descend on earth below.  \nHimalaya's child, adored of all,  \n   The haughty mandate heard,  \nAnd her proud bosom, at the call,  \n   With furious wrath was stirred.  \nDown from her channel in the skies  \n   With awful might she sped  \nWith a giant's rush, in a giant's size.  \n   On S'iva's holy head.  \n'He calls me,' in her wrath she cried,  \n   'And all my flood shall sweep  \nAnd whirl him in its whelming tide  \n   To hell's profoundest deep.  \nHe held tne river on his head,  \n   And kept her wandering, where,  \nDense as Himalaya's woods, were spread  \n   The tangles of his hair.  \n\np. 55  \n\nNo way to earth she found, ashamed,  \n   Though long and sore she strove,  \nCondemned, until her pride were tamed,  \n   Amid his locks to rove.  \nThere, many lengthening seasons through,  \n   The wildered river ran:  \nBhagirath saw it, and anew  \n   His penance dire began.  \nThen S'iva, for the hermit's sake,  \n   Bade her long wanderings end,  \nAnd sinking into Vindu's lake  \n   Her weary waves descend.  \nFrom Ganga, by the God set free,  \n   Seven noble rivers came;  \nHladini, Pavani, and she  \n   Called Nalini by name:  \nThese rolled their lucid waves along  \n   And sought the eastern side.  \nSuchakshu, Sita fair and strong,  \n   And Sindhu's mighty tide--  1  \nThese to the region of the west  \n   With joyful waters sped:  \nThe seventh, the brightest and the best,  \n   Flowed where Bhagirath led.  \nOn S'iva's head descending first  \n   A rest the torrents found:  \nThen down in all their might they burst  \n   And roared along the ground.  \nOn countless glittering scales the beam  \n   Of rosy morning flashed,  \nWhere flsh and dolphins through the stream  \n   Fallen and falling dashed.  \nThen bards who chant celestial lays  \n   And nymphs of heavenly birth  \nFlocked round upon that flow to gaze  \n   That streamed from sky and earth.  \nThe Gods themselves from every sphere,  \n   Incomparably bright,  \nBorne in their golden cars drew near  \n   To see the wondrous sight.  \nThe cloudless sky was all aflame  \n   With the light of a hundred suns  \nWhere'er the shining chariots came  \n   That bore those holy ones.  \nSo flashed the air with crested snakes  \n   And fish of every hue  \nAs when the lightning's glory breaks  \n   Through fields of summer blue.  \nAnd white foam-clouds and silver spray  \n   Were wildly tossed on high,  \nLike swans that urge their homeward way  \n   Across the autumn sky.  \nNow ran the river calm and clear  \n   With current strong and deep:  \n\nNow slowly broadened to a mere,  \n   Or scarcely seemed to creep.  \nNow o'er a length of sandy plain  \n   Her tranquil course she held:  \nNow rose her waves and sank again,  \n   By refluent waves repelled.  \nSo falling first on S'iva's head,  \nThence rushing to their earthly bed,  \nIn ceaseless fall the waters streamed,  \nAnd pure with holy lustre gleamed.  \nThen every spirit, sage, and bard,  \nCondemned to earth by sentence hard,  \nPressed eagerly around the tide  \nThat S'iva's touch had sanctified.  \nThen they whom heavenly doom had hurled,  \nAccursed, to this lower world,  \nTouched the pure wave, and freed from sin  \nResought the skies and entered in  \nAnd all the world was glad, whereon  \nThe glorious water flowed and shone,  \nFor sin and stain were banished thence  \nBy the sweet river's influence.  \nFirst, in a car of heavenly frame,  \nThe royal saint of deathless name,  \nBhagirath, very glorious rode,  \nAnd after him fair Ganga flowed.  \nGod, sage, and bard, the chief in place  \nOf spirits and the Naga race,  \nNymph, giant, fiend, in long array  \nSped where Bhagirath led the way;  \nAnd all the hosts the flood that swim  \nFollowed the stream that followed him.  \nWhere'er the great Bhagirath led,  \nThere ever glorious Ganga fled,  \nThe best of floods, the rivers' queen,  \nWhose waters wash the wicked clean.  \n   It chanced that Jahnu, great and good,  \nEngaged with holy offering stood;  \nThe river spread her waves around  \nFlooding his sacrificial ground.  \nThe saint in anger marked her pride,  \nAnd at one draught her stream he dried.  \nThen God, and sage, and bard, afraid,  \nTo noble high-souled Jahnu prayed,  \nAnd begged that he would kindly deem  \nHis own dear child that holy stream.  \nMoved by their suit, he soothed their fears  \nAnd loosed her waters from his ears.  \nHence Ganga through the world is styled  \nBoth Jahnavi and Jahnu's child.  \nThen onward still she followed fast,  \nAnd reached the great sea bank at last.  \nThence deep below her way she made  \nTo end those rites so long delayed.  \nThe monarch reached the Ocean's side,  \nAnd still behind him Ganga hied.  \nHe sought the depths which open lay  \nWhere Sagar's sons had dug their way.  \nSo leading through earth's nether caves  \nThe river's purifying waves.  \n\np. 56  \n\nOver his kinsmen's dust the lord  \nHis funeral libation poured.  \nSoon as the flood their dust bedewed,  \nTheir spirits gained beatitude,  \nAnd all in heavenly bodies dressed  \nRose to the skies' eternal rest.  \n\nThen thus to King Bhagirath said  \nBrahma, when, coming at the head  \nOf all his bright celestial train,  \nHe saw those spirits freed from stain:  \n'Well done! great Prince of men, well done!  \nThy kinsmen bliss and heaven have won.  \nThe sons of Sagar mighty-souled,  \nAre with the Blest, as Gods, enrolled,  \nLong as the Ocean's flood shall stand  \nUpon the border of the land,  \nSo long shall Sagar's sons remain,  \nAnd, godlike, rank in heaven retain.  \nGanga thine eldest child shall be.  \nCalled from thy name Bhagirathi;  \nNamed also--for her waters fell  \nFrom heaven and flow through earth and hell--  \nTripathaga, stream of the skies.  \nBecause three paths she glorifies,  \nAnd, mighty King, 'tis given thee now  \nTo free thee and perform thy vow.  \nNo longer, happy Prince, delay  \nDrink-offerings to thy kin to pay,  \nFor this the holiest Sagar sighed,  \nBut mourned the boon he sought denied.  \nThen Ans'uman, dear Prince! although  \nNo brighter name the world could show,  \nStrove long the heavenly flood to gain  \nTo visit earth, but strove in vain.  \nNor was she by the sages' peer,  \nBlest with all virtues, most austere,  \nThy sire Dilipa, hither brought,  \nThough with fierce prayers the boon he sought.  \nBut thou, O King, earned success,  \nAnd won high fame which God will bless.  \nThrough thee, O victor of thy foes,  \nOn earth this heavenly Ganga flows,  \nAnd thou hast gained the meed divine  \nThat waits on virtue such as thine.  \nNow in her ever holy wave  \nThyself, O best of heroes, lave:  \nSo shalt thou, pure from every sin,  \nThe blessed fruit of merit win.  \nNow for thy kin who died of yore  \nThe meet libations duly pour.  \nAbove the heavens I now ascend:  \nDepart, and bliss thy steps attend.'  \n\nThus to the mighty king who broke  \nHie foemens' might, Lord Brahma spoke,  \nAnd with his Gods around him rose  \nTo his own heaven of blest repose.  \nThe royal sage no more delayed,  \n\nBut, the libation duly paid,  \nHome to his regal city hied  \nWith water cleansed and purified.  \nThere ruled he his ancestral state,  \nBest of all men, most fortunate.  \nAnd all the people joyed again  \nIn good Bhagirath's gentle reign.  \nRich, prosperous, and blest were they,  \nAnd grief and sickness fled away.  \nThus, Rama, I at length have told  \nHow Ganga came from heaven of old.  \nNow, for the evening passes swift,  \nI wish thee each auspicious gift.  \nThis story of the flood's descent  \nWill give--for' tis most excellent--  \nWealth, purity, fame, length of days,  \nAnd to the skies its hearers raise.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[54:1b](ry043.htm#fr_196) Heaven.\n\n[54:2b](ry043.htm#fr_197) Wind-Gods.\n\n[54:3b](ry044.htm#fr_198) S'iva.\n\n[55:1](ry044.htm#fr_199) The lake Vindu does not exist.
