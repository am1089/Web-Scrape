Naraya _n_ a said :-- The excellent, most sweet stories of Svaha and\nSvadha are told; now I will tell you the story of Dak _s_ i _n_ a; hear\nattentively. In early days, in the region of Goloka, there was a good-natured\nGopi named Sus\xc2\x92ila, beautiful, Radha\xc2\x92s companion and very dear to S\xc2\x92ri Hari.\nShe was fortunate, respected, beautiful, lovely, prosperous, with good teeth,\nlearned, well qualified and of exquisitely handsome form. Her whole body was\ntender and lovely like Kalavati (one versed in 64 arts; moon). She was\nbeautiful and her eyes were like water lilies. Her hips were good and\nspacious; Her breasts were full; she was Shyama (a kind of women having colour\nlike melted gold; body being hot in cold and cool in summer; of youthful\nbeauty); as well She was of the Nyagrodha class of women (an excellent woman.\nStanau Suka _t_ hinau Yasya Nitambe cha Vis\xc2\x92alata. Madhye Ksi _n_ a bhavedya\nSanyagrodha parima _nd_ ala). Always a smile sweetened Her face; and that\nlooked always gracious. Her whole body was covered with jewel ornaments. Her\ncolour was white like the white champakas. Her lips were red like the Bimba\nfruits; Her eyes were like those of a deer.\n\n\n\nSus\xc2\x92ila was very clever in amorous sciences. Her gait was like a swan. She was\nspecially versed in what is called Prema Bhakti (love towards God). So She was\nthe dearest lady of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. And She was of intense emotional\nfeelings. She knows all the sentiments of love; she was witty, humorous, and\nardent for the love of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, the Lord of the Rasa circle. She sat\nby the left side of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a in the presence of Radha. S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a,\nthen cast His glance on Radha, the Chief of the Gopis and hung down His head\nthrough fear. Radha\xc2\x92s face turned red; the two eyes looked like red lilies;\nall Her bodies began to quiver out of anger and Her lips began to shake.\nSeeing that state of Radha, Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a disappeared, fearing that\na quarrel might ensue. Sus\xc2\x92ila and other Gopis seeing that the peaceful Kri\n_sn_ a of Sattva Gu _n_ a and of lovely form had disappeared, began to tremble\nwith fear. Then one lakh Ko _t_ i\n\n\n\np. 980\n\n\n\nGopis seeing Kri _sn_ a absent and Radha angry, became very much afraid and\nbowing their heads down with devotion and with folded palms began to say\nfrequently, \xc2\x93Radhe! Protect us, protect us,\xc2\x94 and they took shelter at Her\nfeet. O Narada! Three lakh Gopas also including Sudama and others took shelter\nat the lotus feet of S\xc2\x92ri Radha out of fear. Seeing, then, Kri _sn_ a absent\nand Her companion Sus\xc2\x92ila running away, Radha cursed her thus :-- \xc2\x93If Sus\xc2\x92ila\ncomes again to this Goloka, she will be reduced to ashes.\xc2\x94 Thus cursing Her\ncompanion Sus\xc2\x92ila out of anger, Radha, the Darling of the Deva of the Devas,\nand the Lady of the Rasa circle went to the Rasa circle and called on Kri _sn_\na, the Lord of the same. Not being able to find out S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a, a minute\nappeared a yuga to Her and she began to say :-- \xc2\x93O Lord of Pra _n_ as! O\nDearer than My life! O Presiding Deity of my life! O Kri _sn_ a! My life seems\nto depart from Thy absence! Come quickly and show Thyself to me. O Lord! It is\nthrough the favour of one\xc2\x92s husband that the pride of women gets increased day\nby day. Women\xc2\x92s safeguards of happiness are their husbands. Therefore women,\nwho are helpless creatures, ought always to serve their husbands according to\nDharma. The husband is the wife\xc2\x92s friend, presiding deity and the sole refuge\nand the chief wealth. It is through husbands that women derive their\npleasures, enjoyments, Dharma, happiness, peace and contentment. If husbands\nare respected, wives are respected and if husbands are dishonoured, women are\ndishonoured too. The husband is the highest thing to a woman. He is the\nhighest friend. There is no better friend than him. The husband is called\nBharta because he supports his wife; he is called Pati, because he preserves\nher; he is called S\xc2\x92vami, because he is the master of her body; he is called\nKanta because he bestows the desired things to her; he is called Bandhu,\nbecause he increases her happiness; he is called Priya, because he gives\npleasure to her; he is called Is\xc2\x92a, because he bestows prosperity on her; he\nis called Pra _n_ es\xc2\x92vara, because he is the lord of her Pra _n_ a; and he is\ncalled Rama _n_ a, because he gives enjoyment to her. There is no other thing\ndearer than husband. The son is born of the husband; hence the son is so dear.\nThe husband is dearer to a family woman than one hundred sons. Those who are\nborn in impure families, cannot know what substance a husband is made up of.\nTaking Baths in all the Tirthas, giving Dak _s_ i _n_ as in all the Yaj\xc3\xb1as\n(sacrifice), circumambulating round the whole earth, performing all\nausterities, observing all vows, making all great gifts, holy fastings, all\nthat are dictated in the S\xc2\x92astras, serving the Guru, the Brahma _n_ as and the\nDevas all cannot compare to even one sixteenth part with serving faithfully\nthe feet of the husband. The husband is the highest; higher than the Spiritual\nTeacher (Guru),\n\n\n\np. 981\n\n\n\nhigher than the Brahma _n_ as, higher than all the Devas. As to man, the\nSpiritual Teacher who imparts the Spiritual Knowledge is the Best and Supreme,\nso to the women their husbands are the best of all. Oh! I am not able to\nrealise the glory of my Dearest, by Whose favour I am the Sole Ruler of one\nlakh Ko _t_ i Gopis, one lakh Ko _t_ i Gopas, innumerable Brahma _nd_ as, and\nall the things thereof, and all the lokas (regions) from Bhu (earth) to\nGoloka. Oh! The womanly nature is insurmountable.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, Radhika began\nto meditate with devotion on S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a. Tears began to flow incessantly\nfrom Her eyes. She exclaimed, \xc2\x93O Lord! O Lord! O Rama _n_ a! Shew Thyself to\nme. I am very much weak and distressed from Thy bereavement.\xc2\x94 Now the Dak _s_\ni _n_ a Devi, driven out from Goloka; practised Tapasya for a long time when\nShe entered into the body of Kamala. The Devas, on the other hand, performed a\nvery difficult Yaj\xc3\xb1a; but they could not derive any fruit therefrom. So they\nwent to Brahma, becoming very sad. Hearing them, Brahma meditated on Vi _sn_ u\nfor a long time with devotion. At last Vi _sn_ u gave Him a reply. Vi _sn_ u\ngot out of the body of Maha Lak _s_ mi a Martya Lak _s_ mi (Lak _s_ mi of the\nearth) and gave Her Dak _s_ i _n_ a to Brahma.Then with a view to yield to the\nDevas the as a fruits of their Karmas, Brahma made over to the Yaj\xc3\xb1a Deva (the\nDeva presiding the sacrifice) the Devi Dak _s_ i _n_ a, offered by Naraya _n_\na. Yaj\xc3\xb1a Deva, then, worshipped Her duly and recited hymns to Her with great\njoy. Her colour was like melted gold; her lustre equalled ko _t_ i Moons; very\nlovely, beautiful, fascinating; face resembling water lilies, of a gentle\nbody; with eyes like Padma Palasa, born of the body of Lak _s_ mi, worshipped\nby Brahma, wearing celestial silken garments, her lips resembling like Bimba\nfruits, chaste, handsome; her braid of hair surrounded by Malati garlands;\nwith a sweet smiling face, ornamented with jewel ornaments, well dressed,\nbathed, enchanting the minds of the Munis, below the hair of her forehead the\ndot of musk and Sindura scented with sandalpaste, of spacious hips, with full\nbreasts, smitten by the arrows of Kama Deva (the God of Love). Such was the\nDak _s_ i _n_ a Devi. Seeing Her, the Yaj\xc3\xb1a Deva fainted. At last he married\nher according to due rites and ceremonies. Taking her to a solitary place, he\nenjoyed her for full divine one hundred years with great joy like Lak _s_ mi\nNaraya _n_ a. Gradually then Dak _s_ i _n_ a became pregnant. She remained so\nfor twelve divine years. Then she duly delivered a nice son as the fruit of\nKarma. When any Karma becomes complete, this son delivers the fruits of that\nKarma. Yaj\xc3\xb1a Deva with His wife Dak _s_ i _n_ a and the above named\nKarmaphala, the bestower of the fruits of actions, gives the desired fruits to\n\n\n\np. 982\n\n\n\nall their sacrificial acts and Karmas. So the Pundits, the knowers of the\nVedas, say. Really he, henceforth, began to give fruits to all the persons of\ntheir acts, with his wife Dak _s_ i _n_ a and son, the bestower of the fruits\nof the actions. The Devas were all satisfied at this and went away\nrespectively to their own abodes. Therefore, the man who performs Karmas,\ngenerally known as Karma Kartas, should pay the Dak _s_ i _n_ a (the\nSacrificial fee) and so he completes at once his actions. It is stated in the\nVedas, that no sooner the Karma Karta pays the Dak _s_ i _n_ a, than he\nobtains the fruits of his Karmas at once. In case the Karma Karta, after he\nhas completed his acts, does not pay either through bad luck or through\nignorance, any Dak _s_ i _n_ a to the Brahma _n_ as, its amount is doubled if\na Muhurta passes away and if one night elapses, its amount is increased, to\none hundred times. If three nights pass away, and the Daksi _n_ a not paid,\nthe amount last brought forward, is increased again to hundred times; if a\nweek passes, the last amount is doubled, and if one month passes away, the Dak\n_s_ i _n_ a is multiplied to one lakh times. If one year passes away, that is\nincreased to ten millions of times and the Karma, also, bears no fruit. Such a\nKarma Karta is known as taking away unfairly a Brahma _n_ a\xc2\x92s property and is\nregarded as impure. He has no right to any further actions. For that sin, he\nbecomes a pauper and diseased. Lak _s_ mi Devi goes away from his house,\nleaves him, cursing him severely. So much so that the Pitris do not accept the\nS\xc2\x92radh, Tarpa _n_ am offered by that wretched fellow. So the Devas do not\naccept his worship, nor the Fire accepts the oblations poured by him. If the\nperson that performs sacrifices does not pay the sacrificial fee that he\nresolves to pay and he who accepts the offer does not demand the sum, both of\nthem go to hell. But if the performer of the sacrifices does not pay when the\npriests demand the fee, then the Yajamana (the performer of the sacrifices)\nonly falls down to hell as the jar, severed from the rope, falls down. The\nYajamana (pupil) is denominated as a Brahmasvapahari (one who robs a Brahma\n_n_ a\xc2\x92s property); he goes ultimately to the Kumbhipaka hell. There he remains\nfor one lakh years punished and threatened by Yama\xc2\x92s messengers. He is then\nreborn as a Cha _nd_ ala, poor and diseased. So much so that his seven\ngenerations above and his seven\n\ngenerations below go to hell.\n\n\n\n64-65. O Narada! Thus I have narrated to you the story of Dak _s_ i _n_ a.\nWhat more do you want to hear? Say. Narada said :-- \xc2\x93O Best of Munis! Who\nbears the fruits of that Karma where no Dak _s_ i _n_ a is paid. Describe the\nmethod of worship that was offered to Dak _s_ i _n_ a by Yaj\xc3\xb1a Deva.\xc2\x94 Naraya\n_n_ a said :-- Where do you find the fruit of any sacrifice without Dak _s_ i\n_n_ a? (i.e., nowhere.) That Karma only gets\n\n\n\np. 983\n\n\n\nfruits where Dak _s_ i _n_ as are paid. And the fruits of the acts void of any\nDak _s_ i _n_ a, Bali who lives in the Patala only enjoys; and no one else.\n\n\n\n66-71. For, in olden times, it was ordained by Vamana Deva that those fruits\nwould go to the king Vali. All those that pertain to S\xc2\x92radh not sanctioned by\nthe Vedas, the charities made without any regard or faith, the worship offered\nby a Brahmi _n_ who is the husband of a Vri _s_ ala (an unmarried girl twelve\nyears in whom menstruation has commenced), the fruits of sacrifices done by an\nimpure Brahma _n_ a (a Brahma _n_ a who fails in his duties), the worship\noffered by impure persons, and the acts of a man devoid of any devotion to his\nGuru, all these are reserved for the king Bali. He enjoys the fruits of all\nthese. O Child! I am now telling you the Dhyan Stotra, and the method of\nworship as per Ka _n_ va S\xc2\x92akha of Dak _s_ i _n_ a Devi. Hear. When Yaj\xc3\xb1a\nDeva, in ancient times got Dak _s_ i _n_ a, skillful in action, he was very\nmuch fascinated by her appearance and being love-stricken, began to praise her\n:-- \xc2\x93O Beautiful One! You were before the chief of the Gopis in Goloka. You\nwere like Radha; you were Her companion; and you were loved by Sri Radha, the\nbeloved of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a.\n\n\n\n72-97. In the Rasa circle, on the Full Moon night in the month of Kartik, in\nthe great festival of Radha, you appeared from the right shoulder of Lak _s_\nmi; hence you were named Dak _s_ i _n_ a. O Beautiful One! You were of good\nnature before; hence your name was Sus\xc2\x92ila. Next you turned due to Radha's\ncurse, into Dak _s_ i _n_ a. It is to my great good luck that you were\ndislodged from Goloka and have come here. O highly fortunate One! Now have\nmercy on me and accept me as your husband. O Devi! You give to all the doers\nof actions, the fruits of their works. Without you, their Karmas bear no\nfruit. So much so, if you be not present in their action the works never shine\nforth in brilliant glory. Without Thee, neither Brahma, nor Vi _sn_ u nor\nMahes\xc2\x92a nor the Regents of the quarters, the ten Dikpalas, can award the\nfruits of actions. Brahma is the incarnate of Karma. Mahes\xc2\x92vara is the\nincarnate of the fruits of Karmas; and I Vi _sn_ u myself is the incarnate of\nYaj\xc3\xb1as. But Thou art the Essence of all. Thou art the Para Prakriti, without\nany attributes, the Para Brahma incarnate, the bestower of the fruits of\naction. Bhagavan S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a cannot award the fruits of actions without\nThee. O Beloved! In every birth let Thou be my S\xc2\x92akti. O Thou with excellent\nface! Without Thee, I am unable to finish well any Karma.\xc2\x94 O Narada! Thus\npraising Dak _s_ i _n_ a Devi, Yaj\xc3\xb1a Deva stood before Her. She, born from the\nshoulder of Lak _s_ mi, became pleased with His Stotra and accepted Him for\nHer bridegroom. If anybody recites this Dak _s_ i _n_ a stotra during\nsacrifice, he gets all the results thereof.\n\n\n\np. 984\n\n\n\nIf anybody recites this stotra in the Rajasuya sacrifice, Vajapaya, Gomedha\n(cow sacrifice) Naramedha (man sacrifice), As\xc2\x92vamedha (horse sacrifice),\nLangala Sacrifice, Vi _sn_ u Yaj\xc3\xb1a tending to increase one\xc2\x92s fame, in the act\nof giving over wealth or pieces of lands, digging tanks or wells, or giving\nfruits, in Gaja medha (elephant sacrifice), in Loha Yaj\xc3\xb1a (iron sacrifice),\nSvarna Yaj\xc3\xb1a (gold sacrifice), Ratna Yaj\xc3\xb1a (making over jewels in sacrifices),\nTamra Yaj\xc3\xb1a (copper), S\xc2\x92iva Yaj\xc3\xb1a, Rudra Yaj\xc3\xb1a, S\xc2\x92akra Yaj\xc3\xb1a, Bandhuka Yaj\xc3\xb1a,\nVaru _n_ a Yaj\xc3\xb1a (for rains), Ka _nd_ aka Yaj\xc3\xb1a, for crushing the enemies,\nS\xc2\x92uchi Yaj\xc3\xb1a, Dharma Yaj\xc3\xb1a, Papa mochana Yaj\xc3\xb1a, Brahma _n_ i Karma Yaj\xc3\xb1a, the\nauspicious Prakriti Yaga, sacrifices, his work is achieved then without any\nhitch or obstacle. There is no doubt in this. The stotra, thus, is mentioned\nnow; hear about the Dhyanam and the method of worship. First of all, one\nshould worship in the S\xc2\x92alagrama stone, or in an earthen jar (Gha _t_ a) Dak\n_s_ i _n_ a Devi. The Dhyanam runs thus :-- \xc2\x93O Dak _s_ i _n_ a! Thou art\nsprung from the right shoulder of Lak _s_ mi; Thou art a part of Kamala; Thou\nart clever (Dak _s_ a) in all the actions and Thou bestowest the fruits of all\nthe actions. Thou art the S\xc2\x92akti of Vi _sn_ u, Thou art revered, worshipped.\nThou bestowest all that is auspicious; Thou art purity; Thou bestowest purity,\nThou art good natured. So I meditate on Thee.\xc2\x94 Thus meditating, the\nintelligent one should worship Dak _s_ i _n_ a with the principal mantra. Then\nwith the Vedic Mantras, padyas, etc. (offerings of various sorts) are to be\noffered. Now the mantra as stated in the Vedas, runs thus :-- \xc2\x93Om S\xc2\x92rim Klim\nHrim Dak _s_ i _n_ ayai Svaha.\xc2\x94 With this mantra, all the offerings, such as\npadyas, arghyas, etc., are to be given, and one should worship, as per rules,\nDak _s_ i _n_ a Devi with devotion. O Narada! Thus I have stated to you the\nanecdote of Daksina. Happiness, pleasure, and the fruits of all karmas are\nobtained by this. Being engaged in sacrificial acts, in this Bharatavar _s_ a,\nif one hears attentively this Dhyanam of Dak _s_ i _n_ a, his sacrifice\nbecomes defectless. So much so that the man who has got no sons gets\nundoubtedly good and qualified sons; if he has no wife, he gets a best wife,\ngood natured, beautiful, of slender waist, capable to give many sons, sweet\nspeaking, humble, chaste, pure, and Kulina; if he be void of learning, he gets\nlearning; if he be poor he gets wealth; if he be without any land, he gets\nland and if he has no attendants, he gets attendants. If a man hears for one\nmonth this stotra of Dak _s_ i _n_ a Devi, he gets over all difficulties and\ndangers, bereavements from friends, troubles, inprisonments, and all other\ncalamities.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere ends the Forty-fifth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the anecdote of Dak _s_\ni _n_ a in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 46](bk09ch46.htm)\n\n"
