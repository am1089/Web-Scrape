On the fifth of these nectars the Sadhyas live, with Brahman at their\nhead. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the\nnectar.\n\n2\\. They enter into that colour, and they rise from that colour.\n\n3\\. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the Sadhyas, with Brahman at\ntheir head; he sees the nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered that\ncolour, rises again from that colour.\n\n4\\. So long as the sun rises in the north and sets in the south, twice as long\ndoes it rise above, and set below; and so long does he follow the sovereign\npower of the Sadhyas 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[43:1](sbe01068.htm#fr_167) The meaning of the five Khandas from 6 to 10 is\nclear, in so far as they are intended to show that he who knows or meditates\non the sacrifices as described before, enjoys his reward in different worlds\nwith the Vasus, Rudras, &c. for certain periods of time, till at last he\nreaches the true Brahman. Of these periods each succeeding one is supposed to\nbe double the length of the preceding one. This is expressed by imagining a\nmigration of the sun from east to south, west, north, and zenith. Each change\nof the sun marks a new world, and the duration of each successive world is\ncomputed as double the duration of the preceding world. Similar ideas have\nbeen more fully developed in the Pura _n_ as, and the commentator is at great\npains to remove apparent contradictions between the Paura _n_ ik and Vaidik\naccounts, following, as \xc3\x82nanda _g_ \xc3\xb1anagiri remarks, the Dravi _d_ a _k_ arya\n(p. 173, l. 13).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 11](sbe01069.htm)\n\n'
