XIV.\n\nDescendants of Prithu. Legend of the Prachetasas: they are desired by their\nfather to multiply mankind, by worshipping Vishn\xcc\x81u: they plunge into the sea,\nand meditate on and praise him: he appears, and grants their wishes.\n\nPRITHU had two valiant sons, Antarddhi and Pali 1. The son of Antarddhana, by\nhis wife Sikhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81in\xcc\x81i, was Havirdhana, to whom Dhishan\xcc\x81a, a princess of the\nrace of Agni, bore six sons, Prachinaverhis, \xc5\x9aukra, Gaya, Krishn\xcc\x81a, Vraja, and\nAjina 2. The first of these was a mighty prince and patriarch, by whom mankind\nwas multiplied after the death of Havirdhana. He was called Prachinaverhis\nfrom his placing upon the earth the sacred grass, pointing to the east 3. At\nthe termination of a\n\np. 107\n\nrigid penance the married Savarn\xcc\x81a, the daughter of the ocean, who had been\npreviously betrothed to him, and who had by the king ten sons, who were all\nstyled Prachetasas, and were skilled in military science: they all observed\nthe same duties, practised religious austerities, and remained immersed in the\nbed of the sea for ten thousand years.\n\nMAITREYA.--You can inform me, great sage, why the magnanimous Prachetasas\nengaged in penance in the waters of the sea.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--The sons of Prachinaverhis were originally informed by their\nfather, who had been appointed as a patriarch, and whose mind was intent on\nmultiplying mankind, that the had been respectfully enjoined by Brahma, the\ngod of gods, to labour to this end, and that he had promised obedience: "now\ntherefore," continued he, "do you, my sons, to oblige me, diligently promote\nthe increase of the people, for the orders of the father of all creatures are\nentitled to respect." The sons of the king, having heard their father\'s words,\nreplied, "So be it;" but they then inquired of him, as he could best explain\nit, by what means they might accomplish the augmentation of mankind. He said\nto them; "Whoever worships Vishn\xcc\x81u, the bestower of good, attains undoubtedly\nthe object of his desires: there is no other mode. What further can I tell\nyou? Adore therefore Govinda, who is Hari, the lord of all beings, in order to\neffect the increase of the human race, if you wish to succeed.\n\np. 108\n\n[paragraph continues] The eternal Purushottama is to be propitiated by him who\nwishes for virtue, wealth, enjoyment, or liberation. Adore him, the\nimperishable, by whom, when propitiated, the world was first created, and\nmankind will assuredly be multiplied."\n\nThus instructed by their father, the ten Prachetasas plunged into the depths\nof the ocean, and with minds wholly devoted to Narayan\xcc\x81a, the sovereign of the\nuniverse, who is beyond all worlds, were engrossed by religious austerity for\nten thousand years: remaining there, they with fixed thoughts praised Hari,\nwho, when propitiated, confers on those who praise him all that they desire.\n\nMAITREYA.--The excellent praises that the Prachetasas addressed to Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nwhilst they stood in the deep, you, oh best of Munis, are qualified to repeat\nto me.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81\xc5\x9aARA.--Hear, Maitreya, the hymn which the Prachetasas, as they stood in\nthe waters of the sea, sang of old to Govinda, their nature being identified\nwith him:--\n\n"We bow to him whose glory is the perpetual theme of every speech; him first,\nhim last; the supreme lord of the boundless world; who is primeval light; who\nis without his like; indivisible and infinite; the origin of all existent\nthings, movable or stationary. To that supreme being who is one with time,\nwhose first forms, though he be without form, are day and evening and night,\nbe adoration. Glory to him, the life of all living things, who is the same\nwith the moon, the receptacle of ambrosia, drunk daily by the gods and\nprogenitors: to him who is one with the sun, the cause of heat and cold and\nrain, who dissipates the gloom, and illuminates the sky with his radiance: to\nhim who is one with earth, all-pervading, and the asylum of smell and other\nobjects of sense, supporting the whole world by its solidity. We adore that\nform of the deity Hari which is water, the womb of the world, the seed of all\nliving beings. Glory to the mouth of the gods, the eater of the Havya; to the\neater of the Kavya, the mouth of the progenitors; to Vishn\xcc\x81u, who is identical\nwith fire; to him who is one with air, the origin of ether, existing as the\nfive vital airs in the body, causing constant vital action; to him who is\nidentical with the atmosphere, pure, illimitable, shapeless,\n\np. 109\n\nseparating all creatures. Glory to Krishn\xcc\x81a, who is Brahma in the form of\nsensible objects, who is ever the direction of the faculties of sense. We\noffer salutation to that supreme Hari who is one with the senses, both subtle\nand substantial, the recipient of all impressions, the root of all knowledge:\nto the universal soul, who, as internal intellect, delivers the impressions\nreceived by the senses to soul: to him who has the properties of Prakriti; in\nwhom, without end, rest all things; from whom all things proceed; and who is\nthat into which all things resolve. We worship that Purushottoma, the god who\nis pure spirit, and who, without qualities, is ignorantly considered as\nendowed with qualities. We adore that supreme Brahma, the ultimate condition\nof Vishn\xcc\x81u, unproductive, unborn, pure, void of qualities, and free from\naccidents; who is neither high nor low, neither bulky nor minute, has neither\nshape, nor colour, nor shadow, nor substance, nor affection, nor body; who is\nneither etherial nor susceptible of contact, smell, or taste; who has neither\neyes, nor ears, nor motion, nor speech, nor breath, nor mind, nor name, nor\nrace, nor enjoyment, nor splendour; who is without cause, without fear,\nwithout error, without fault, undecaying, immortal, free from passion, without\nsound, imperceptible, inactive, independent of place or time, detached from\nall investing properties; but (illusively) exercising irresistible might, and\nidentified with all beings, dependent upon none. Glory to that nature of\nVishn\xcc\x81u which tongue can not tell, nor has eye beheld."\n\nThus glorifying Vishn\xcc\x81u, and intent in meditation on him, the Prachetasas\npassed ten thousand years of austerity in the vast ocean; on which Hari, being\npleased with them, appeared to them amidst the waters, of the complexion of\nthe full-blown lotus leaf. Beholding him mounted on the king of birds,\nGarud\xcc\x81a, the Prachetasas bowed down their heads in devout homage; when Vishn\xcc\x81u\nsaid to them, "Receive the boon you have desired; for I, the giver of good, am\ncontent with you, and am present." The Prachetasas replied to him with\nreverence, and told him that the cause of their devotions was the command of\ntheir father to effect the multiplication of mankind. The god, having\naccordingly granted to them the object of their prayers, disappeared, and they\ncame up from the water.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[106:1](vp049.htm#fr_275) The text of the Vayu and Brahma (or Hari Van\xc5\x9ba)\nread, like that of the Vishn\xcc\x81u, ###. Mons. Langlois understands the two last\nwords as a compound epithet; "Se jouirent dupouvoir de se rendre invisibles."\nThe construction would admit of such a sense, but it seems more probable that\nthey are intended for names. The lineage of Prithu is immediately continued\nthrough one of them, Antarddhana, which is the same as Antarddhi; as the\ncommentator states with regard to that appellation, ###, and as the\ncommentator on the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba remarks of the succeeding name, \'one of the\nbrothers being called Antarddhana or Antarddhi,\' leaves no other sense for\nPalin but that of a proper name. The Bhagavata gives Prithu five sons,\nVijitaswa, Haryyaksha, Dhumrakesa, Vrika, and Dravina, and adds that the elder\nwas also named Antarddhana, in consequence of having obtained from Indra the\npower of making himself invisible.\n\n[106:2](vp049.htm#fr_276) The Bhagavata, as usual, modifies this genealogy;\nAntarddhana has by Sikhan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81in\xcc\x81i three sons, who were the three fires, Pavaka,\nPavamana, and Suchi, condemned by a curse of Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha to be born again: by\nanother wife, Nabhaswati, he has Havirddhana, whose sons are the same as those\nof the text, only giving another name, Varhishad as well as Prachinaverhis, to\nthe first. According to the Mahabharata (Moksha Dharma), which has been\nfollowed by the Padma P., Prachinavarhis was born in the family of Atri.\n\n[106:3](vp049.htm#fr_277) The text is, ###. Ku\xc5\x9ba or varhis is properly\n\'sacrificial grass\' (Poa); and Prachinagra, literally, \'having its tips\ntowards the east;\' the direction in which it should be placed upon the ground,\nas a seat for the gods on occasion of offerings made to them. The name\ntherefore intimates, either that the practice originated with him, or, as the\ncommentator explains it, that he was exceedingly devout, offering sacrifices\nor invoking p. 107 the gods every where. The Hari Van\xc5\x9ba adds a verse to that\nof our text, reading, ###, which Mons. Langlois has rendered, \'Quand il\nmarchoit sur la terre les pointes de cousa etoient courbees vers l\'Orient;\'\nwhich he supposes to mean, \'Que ce prince avait tourne ses pensees et porte sa\ndomination vers l\'Orient:\' a supposition that might have been obviated by a\nlittle further consideration of the verse of Manu to which he refers. "If he\nhave sitten on culms of grass with their points towards the east," &c. The\ncommentary explains the passage as above, referring ### to ### not to ### as,\n###. \'He was called Prachinavarhis, because his sacred grass, pointing east,\nwas going upon the very earth, or was spread over the whole earth.\' The text\nof the Bhagavata also explains clearly what is meant: \'By whose sacred grass,\npointing to the east, as he performed sacrifice after sacrifice, the whole\nearth, his sacrificial ground, was overspread.\'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XV](vp050.htm)\n\n'
