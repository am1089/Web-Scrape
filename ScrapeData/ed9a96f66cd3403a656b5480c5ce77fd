O Knife, forbear to harm him.  \n2 The Mother Floods shall make us bright and shining, cleansers  \nof holy oil, with oil shall cleanse us.  \nFor, Goddesses, they bear off all defilement. I rise up  \nfrom them purified and brightened.  \nThe form of Consecration and of Fervour art thou. I put  \nthee on, the kind and blissful, maintaining an agreeable  \nappearance.  \n3 The Great Ones\xc2\x92 milk art thou. Giver of splendour art  \nthou: bestow on me the gift of splendour.  \nPupil art thou of Vritra's eye. The giver of eyes art thou.  \nGive me the gift of vision.  \n4 Purify me the Lord of Thought! Purify me the Lord of  \nSpeech! Purify me God Savitar with perfect strainer, with  \nthe beams of Surya!\n\np. 27\n\nOf thee, Lord of the Strainer! who art by the strainer  \npurified,  \nWith what desire I purify myself, may I accomplish it.  \n5 We come to you for precious wealth, O Gods, as sacrifice  \nproceeds.  \nO Gods, we call on you to give blessings that wait on sacrifice.  \n6 Svaha! from mind the sacrifice. Svaha! from spacious  \nfirmament.  \nSvaha! from Dyaus and Prithivi. Svaha! from Wind I  \nseize. Svaha!  \n7 To Resolution, Motive, Agni, Svaha! All-hail to Wisdom,  \nand to Mind, and Agni!  \nAll-hail to Consecration, Fervour, Agni! Hail to Sarasvati,  \nPushan, and Agni!  \nYe vast, divine, all-beneficial Waters, ye Heaven and Earth  \nand spacious Air between them,  \nLet us adore Brihaspati with oblation. All-hail!  \n8 May every mortal man elect the friendship of the guiding  \nGod.  \nEach one solicits him for wealth: let him seek fame to prosper  \nhim.  \n9 Rik's, Saman's counterparts are ye. I touch you. Protect  \nme till the sacrifice be ended.  \nThou art a place of refuge. Give me refuge. Obeisance  \nunto thee! Forbear to harm me.  \n10 Strength of Angirases art thou. Wool-soft, bestow thou  \nstrength on me.  \nThou art the garment-knot of Soma. Vishnu's refuge art  \nthou, the Sacrificer's refuge.\n\np. 28\n\nThou art the womb of Indra. Make the crops produce  \nabundant grain.  \nStand up erect, O Tree. Protect me from harm until this  \nsacrifice be ended.  \n11 Prepare ye vow-food. Agni is the Brahman, Agni is sacrifice,  \nthe tree is holy.  \nFor aid we meditate divine Intelligence, most merciful,  \nFree-giver, bringing worship May it guide us gently, as  \nwe would.  \nFavour us Gods, mind-horn, endowed with mind and intellectual  \nmight! All-hail to them! May they be our protectors.  \n12 Waters that we have drunk! become refreshing, become  \nauspicious draughts within our belly.  \nFree from all sin and malady and sickness, may they be  \npleasant to our taste, divine Ones, immortal, strengtheners  \nof eternal Order.  \n13 This is thy sacrificial form.  \nNot offspring, waters I discharge. Freeing from sin and  \nconsecrate by Svaha enter ye the earth. Be thou united  \nwith the earth.  \n14 O Agni, watch thou well. May we take joy in most refreshing  \nsleep.  \nProtect us with unceasing care. From slumber waken us  \nagain.\n\np. 29\n\n15 Thought hath returned to me, and life; my breath and  \nsoul have come again.  \nOur bodies' guard, unscathed, Vaisvanara Agni preserve us  \nfrom misfortune and dishonour.  \n16 Thou, Agni, art the guardian God of sacred vows among  \nmankind, thou meet for praise at holy rites.  \nGrant this much, Soma! bring yet more. God Savitar who  \ngiveth wealth hath given treasure unto us.  \n17 This is thy form, O Bright One, this thy lustre. Combine  \nwith this thy form and go to splendour.  \nImpetuous art thou, upheld by mind, and Vishnu loveth  \nthee.  \n18 Moved by thine impulse who hast true impulsion, may I  \nobtain a prop to stay my body.  \nPure art thou, glistering art thou, immortal, dear to all the  \nGods.  \n19 Thought art thou, mind, intelligence, the Guerdon, royal,  \nworshipful, Aditi with a double head. Succeed for us in  \ngoing forth, succeed for us in thy return. May Mitra  \nbind thee by the foot. May Pushan guard thy pathways  \nfor Indra whose eye is over all.\n\np. 30\n\n20 Thy mother give thee leave to go, thy father, thine own  \nbrother, and thy friend of the same herd with thee!  \nGo thou, O Goddess, to the God. To Soma go for Indra's  \nsake.  \nMay Rudra turn thee back. Return safely with Soma as  \nthy friend.  \n21 Thou art a Vasvi, thou art Aditi, thou art an \xc3\x82ditya, thou  \nart a Rudra, thou art a Chandra.  \nBrihaspati vouchsafe thee rest and comfort! Rudra with  \nVasus looks on thee with favour.  \n22 On Aditi's head I sprinkle thee, on the earth's place of  \nsacrifice.  \nFootstep of Ida art thou, filled with fatness. Hail!  \nRejoice in us. Thy kinship is in us. In thee are riches.  \nMine be riches! Let us not be deprived of abundant  \nriches. Thine, thine are riches.  \n23 I with my thought have commerced with divine far-sighted  \nDakshina.  \nSteal not my life. I will not thine. May I, O Goddess, in  \nthy sight find for myself a hero son.  \n24 Tell Soma this for me: This is thy share allied with Gayatri.  \nFor me say this to Soma: This is thine allotted Trishtup  \nshare.  \nTell Soma this for me: This is thy share allied with Jagati.  \nTell Soma this for me: Win thou sole lordship of the metres\xc2\x92  \nnames.  \nOurs art thou: pure thy juice for draught. Let separators  \npick thee out.\n\np. 31\n\n25 I sing my song of praise to him, Savitar, God between the  \nBowls, strong with the wisdom of the wise, of true impulsion,  \nwealth-giver, the well-beloved thoughtful Sage.  \nTo him at whose impulsion shone aloft in heaven the splendid  \nlight.  \nMost wise, the Golden-handed hath measured the sky with  \nskilled design.  \nFor living creatures, thee. Let living creatures breathe  \nafter thee. Breathe after living creatures.  \n26 Thee who art pure, with what is pure I purchase, the bright  \nwith bright, immortal with immortal.  \nThe Sacrificer keep thy cow. Let thy gold pieces be with us.  \nFervour's form art thou, and Prajapati's nature. With the  \nmost noble animal art thou purchased. May I increase  \nwith thousandfold abundance.  \n27 As friend, the giver of good friends, approach us!  \nTake thou thy seat on the right thigh of Indra, yearning on  \nyearning, pleasing on the pleasing.  \nAnghari, Svana, Bhraja, and Bambhari, O Hasta, and Suhasta  \nand Krisanu,  \nThese are your prices for the Soma purchase. Keep them  \nsecurely, let them never fail you.  \n28 Keep me, O Agni, from unrighteous conduct: make me a  \nsharer in the path of goodness.\n\np. 32\n\nI, following Immortals, have arisen with longer life, with a  \ngood life before me.  \n29 Now have we entered on the path that leads to bliss without  \na foe,  \nThe path whereon a man escapes all enemies and gathers  \nwealth.  \n30 The skin of Aditi art thou. Sit on the lap of Aditi.  \nThe Bull hath propped the sky and air's mid-region, the  \ncompass of the broad earth hath he measured.  \nHe, King Supreme, approached all living creatures. Truly  \nall these are Varuna's ordinances.  \n31 Over the woods the air hath he extended, put milk in kine  \nand vigorous speed in horses,  \nSet intellect in hearts and fire in houses, Surya in heaven  \nand Soma on the mountain.  \n32 Ascend the eye of Surya, mount the pupil set in Agni's eye  \nWhere, radiant through the Wise One, thou speedest along  \nwith dappled steeds.  \n33 Approach, ye oxen, fit to bear the yoke; be yoked without  \na tear.  \nSlaying no man, urging the Brahman forward, go happily  \nto the Sacrificer's dwelling.  \n34 Lord of the World, thou art my gracious helper: move forward  \non thy way to all the stations.  \nLet not opponents, let not robbers find thee, let not malignant  \nwolves await thy coming.  \nFly thou away having become a falcon. Go to the dwelling  \nof the Sacrificer. That is the special place for us to rest in.\n\np. 33\n\n35 Do homage unto Varuna's and Mitra's eye: offer this solemn  \nworship to the Mighty God,  \nWho seeth far away, the Ensign born of Gods. Sing praises  \nunto Surya, to the Son of Dyaus.  \n36 Thou art a prop for Varuna to rest on. Ye are the pins that  \nstrengthen Varuna's pillar.  \nThou art the lawful seat where Varuna sitteth. Sit on the  \nlawful seat where Varuna sitteth.  \n37 Such of thy glories as with poured oblations men honour,  \nmay they all invest our worship.  \nWealth-giver, furtherer with troops of heroes, sparing the  \nbrave, come, Soma, to our houses.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book V](wyvbk05.htm)\n\n"
