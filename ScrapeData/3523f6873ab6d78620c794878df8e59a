The Paddhati of Rama _k_ andra understands\nsvadhyayam adhiyita as a prescription to perform the daily Brahmaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a\n(comp., for instance, \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya III, 2; \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11, 22\nseq.), which consists in the recitation of portions of the Veda; the hymns and\nverses stated in Sutra 2 are, according to the same authority, to be repeated\nimmediately after the recitation of the svadhyaya ('svadhyayanantaram').\nNaraya _n_ a, on the contrary, considers that the svadhyaya prescribed in\nSutra 1 consists of those very hymns and verses which are indicated in the\nsecond Sutra. As to the Brahmaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, he says that the _k_ a at the end\nof the second Sutra may be referred to it ('the word _k_ a means that texts\nprocuring a long life, such as Rig-veda I, 89, should be murmured, or an\ninjunction of the Brahmaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a is intended'). At all events it is very\ndifficult to believe that the recitation of the texts stated in this chapter\nshould be quite independent from the daily Brahmaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a. About the\nperformance of the Brahmaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a in our days comp. the note of Professor\nBuhler, Sacred Books of the East, vol. ii, p. 43.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 5](sbe29007.htm)\n\n"
