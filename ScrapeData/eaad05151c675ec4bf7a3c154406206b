XIII.\n\nSons of Satwata. Bhoja princes of Mrittikavati. Surya the friend of Satrajit:\nappears to him in a bodily form: gives him the Syamantaka gem: its brilliance\nand marvellous properties. Satrajit gives it to Prasena, who is killed by a\nlion: the lion killed by the bear Jambavat. Krishn\xcc\x81a suspected of killing\nPrasena, goes to look for him in the forests: traces the bear to his cave:\nfights with him for the jewel: the contest prolonged: supposed by his\ncompanions to be slain: he overthrows Jambavat, and marries his daughter\nJambavati: returns with her and the jewel to Dwaraka: restores the jewel to\nSatrajit, and marries his daughter Satyabhama. Satrajit murdered by\n\xc5\x9aatadhanwan: avenged by Krishn\xcc\x81a. Quarrel between Krishn\xcc\x81a and Balarama.\nAkrura possessed of the jewel: leaves Dwaraka. Public calamities. Meeting of\nthe Yadavas. Story of Akrura\'s birth: he is invited to return: accused by\nKrishn\xcc\x81a of having the Syamantaka jewel: produces it in full assembly: it\nremains in his charge: Krishn\xcc\x81a acquitted of having purloined it.\n\nTHE sons of Satwata were Bhajina, Bhajamana, Divya, Andhaka, Devavriddha,\nMahabhoja, and Vrishn\xcc\x81i 1. Bhajamana had three sons, Nimi 2, Krikan\xcc\x81a 3, and\nVrishn\xcc\x81i 4, by one wife, and as many by another, \xc5\x9aatajit, Sahasrajit, and\nAyutajit 5. The son of Devavriddha was Babhru of whom this verse is recited;\n"We hear when afar, and we behold when nigh, that Babhru is the first of men,\nand Devavriddha is equal to the gods: sixty-six persons following the precepts\nof one, and six thousand and eight who were disciples of the other, obtained\nimmortality." Mahabhoja was a pious prince; his descendants were the Bhojas,\nthe princes of Mrittikavati 6, thence called Marttikavatas 7. Vrishn\xcc\x81i had two\nsons, Sumitra and Yudhajit 8; from the former Anamitra and \xc5\x9aini were\n\np. 425\n\nborn 9. The son of Anamitra was Nighna, who had two sons, Prasena and\nSatrajit. The divine \xc3\x81ditya, the sun, was the friend of the latter.\n\nOn one occasion Satrajit, whilst walking along the sea shore, addressed his\nmind to Surya, and hymned his praises; on which the divinity appeared and\nstood before him. Beholding him in an indistinct shape, Satrajit said to the\nsun, "I have beheld thee, lord, in the heavens as a globe of fire: now do thou\nshew favour unto me, that I may see thee in thy proper form." On this the sun\ntaking the jewel called Syamantaka from off his neck, placed it apart, and\nSatrajit beheld him of a dwarfish stature, with a body like burnished copper,\nand with slightly reddish eyes. Having offered his adorations, the sun desired\nhim to demand a boon, and he requested that the jewel might become his. The\nsun presented it to him, and then resumed his place in the sky. Having\nobtained the spotless gem of gems, Satrajit wore it on his neck, and becoming\nas brilliant thereby as the sun himself, irradiating all the region with his\nsplendour, he returned to Dwaraka. The inhabitants of that city, beholding him\napproach, repaired to the eternal male, Purushottama, who, to sustain the\nburden of the earth, had assumed a mortal form (as Krishn\xcc\x81a), and said to him,\n"Lord, assuredly the divine sun is coming to visit you." But Krishn\xcc\x81a smiled,\nand said, "It is not the divine sun, but Satrajit, to whom \xc3\x81ditya has\npresented the Syamantaka gem, and he now wears it: go and behold him without\napprehension." Accordingly they departed. Satrajit having gone to his house,\nthere deposited the jewel, which yielded daily eight loads of gold, and\nthrough its marvellous virtue dispelled all fear of portents, wild beasts,\nfire, robbers, and famine.\n\np. 426\n\nAchyuta was of opinion that this wonderful gem should be in the possession of\nUgrasena; but although he had the power of taking it from Satrajit, he did not\ndeprive him of it, that he might not occasion ally disagreement amongst the\nfamily. Satrajit, on the other hand, fearing that Krishn\xcc\x81a would ask him for\nthe jewel, transferred it to his brother Prasena. Now it was the peculiar\nproperty of this jewel, that although it was an inexhaustible source of good\nto a virtuous person, yet when worn by a man of bad character it was the cause\nof his death. Prasena having taken the gem, and hung it round his neck,\nmounted his horse, and went to the woods to hunt. In the chase he was killed\nby a lion. The lion, taking the jewel in his mouth, was about to depart, when\nhe was observed and killed by Jambavat, the king of the bears, who carrying\noff the gem retired into his cave, and gave it to his son Sukumara to play\nwith. When some time had elapsed, and Prasena did not appear, the Yadavas\nbegan to whisper one to another, and to say, "This is Krishn\xcc\x81a\'s doing:\ndesirous of the jewel, and not obtaining it, he has perpetrated the murder of\nPrasena in order to get it into his possession."\n\nWhen these calumnious rumours came to the knowledge of Krishn\xcc\x81a, he collected\na number of the Yadavas, and accompanied by them pursued the course of Prasena\nby the impressions of his horse\'s hoofs. Ascertaining by this means that he\nand his horse had been killed by a lion, he was acquitted by all the people of\nany share in his death. Desirous of recovering the gem, he thence followed the\nsteps of the lion, and at no great distance came to the place where the lion\nhad been killed by the bear. Following the footmarks of the latter, he arrived\nat the foot of a mountain, where he desired the Yadavas to await him, whilst\nhe continued the track. Still guided by the marks of the feet, he discovered a\ncavern, and had scarcely entered it when he heard the nurse of Sukumara saying\nto him, "The lion killed Prasena; the lion has been killed by Jambavat: weep\nnot, Sukumara, the Syamantaka is your own." Thus assured of his object,\nKrishn\xcc\x81a advanced into the cavern, and saw the brilliant jewel in the hands of\nthe nurse, who was giving it as a plaything to Sukumara. The nurse soon\ndescried his\n\np. 427\n\napproach, and marking his eyes fixed upon the gem with eager desire, called\nloudly for help. Hearing her cries, Jambavat, full of anger, came to the cave,\nand a conflict ensued between him and Achyuta, which lasted twenty-one days.\nThe Yadavas who had accompanied the latter waited seven or eight days in\nexpectation of his return, but as the foe of Madhu still came not forth, they\nconcluded that he must have met his death in the cavern. "It could not have\nrequired so many days," they thought, "to overcome an enemy;" and accordingly\nthey departed, and returned to Dwaraka, and announced that Krishn\xcc\x81a had been\nkilled.\n\nWhen the relations of Achyuta heard this intelligence, they performed all the\nobsequial rites suited to the occasion. The food and water thus offered to\nKrishn\xcc\x81a in the celebration of his \xc5\x9araddha served to support his life, and\ninvigorate his strength in the combat in which he was engaged; whilst his\nadversary, wearied by daily conflict with a powerful foe, bruised and battered\nin every limb by heavy blows, and enfeebled by want of food, became unable\nlonger to resist him. Overcome by his mighty antagonist, Jambavat cast himself\nbefore him and said, "Thou, mighty being, art surely invincible by all the\ndemons, and by the spirits of heaven, earth, or hell; much less art thou to be\nvanquished by mean and powerless creatures in a human shape; and still less by\nsuch as we are, who are born of brute origin. Undoubtedly thou art a portion\nof my sovereign lord Narayan\xcc\x81a, the defender of the universe." Thus addressed\nby Jambavat, Krishn\xcc\x81a explained to him fully that he had descended to take\nupon himself the burden of the earth, and kindly alleviated the bodily pain\nwhich the bear suffered from the fight, by touching him with his hand.\nJambavat again prostrated himself before Krishn\xcc\x81a, and presented to him his\ndaughter Jambavati, as an offering suitable to a guest. He also delivered to\nhis visitor the Syamantaka jewel. Although a gift from such an individual was\nnot fit for his acceptance, yet Krishn\xcc\x81a took the gem for the purpose of\nclearing his reputation. He then returned along with his bride Jambavati to\nDwaraka..\n\nWhen the people of Dwaraka beheld Krishn\xcc\x81a alive and returned, they were\nfilled with delight, so that those who were bowed down with\n\np. 428\n\nyears recovered youthful vigour; and all the Yadavas, men and women, assembled\nround \xc3\x81nakadundubhi, the father of the hero, and congratulated him. Krishn\xcc\x81a\nrelated to the whole assembly of the Yadavas all that had happened, exactly as\nit had befallen, and restoring the Syamantaka jewel to Satrajit was exonerated\nfrom the crime of which he had been falsely accused. He then led Jambavati\ninto the inner apartments.\n\nWhen Satrajit reflected that he had been the cause of the aspersions upon\nKrishn\xcc\x81a\'s character, he felt alarmed, and to conciliate the prince he gave\nhim to wife his daughter Satyabhama. The maiden had been previously sought in\nmarriage by several of the most distinguished Yadavas, as Akrura, Kritavarman\nand \xc5\x9aatadhanwan, who were highly incensed at her being wedded to another, and\nleagued in enmity against Satrajit. The chief amongst them, with Akrura and\nKritavarman, said to \xc5\x9aatadhanwan, "This caitiff Satrajit has offered a gross\ninsult to you, as well as to us who solicited his daughter, by giving her to\nKrishn\xcc\x81a: let him not live: why do you not kill him, and take the jewel?\nShould Achyuta therefore enter into feud with you, we will take your part."\nUpon this promise \xc5\x9aatadhanwan undertook to slay Satrajit.\n\nWhen news arrived that the sons of Pan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81u had been burned in\n[the](errata.htm#20) house of wax 10, Krishn\xcc\x81a, who knew the real truth, set\noff for Baran\xcc\x81avata to allay the animosity of Duryodhana, and to perform the\nduties his relationship required. \xc5\x9aatadhanwan taking advantage of his absence,\nkilled Satrajit in his sleep, and took possession of the gem. Upon this coming\nto the knowledge of Satyabhama, she immediately mounted her chariot, and,\nfilled with fury at her father\'s murder, repaired to Baran\xcc\x81avata, and told her\nhusband how Satrajit had been killed by \xc5\x9aatadhanwan in resentment of her\nhaving been married to another, and how he had carried off the jewel; and she\nimplored him to take prompt measures to avenge such heinous wrong. Krishn\xcc\x81a,\nwho is ever internally placid, being informed of these transactions, said to\nSatyabhama, as his eyes flashed with indignation, "These are indeed\n\np. 429\n\naudacious injuries, but I will not submit to them from so vile a wretch. They\nmust assail the tree, who would kill the birds that there have built their\nnests. Dismiss excessive sorrow; it needs not your lamentations to excite any\nwrath." Returning forthwith to Dwaraka, Krishn\xcc\x81a took Baladeva apart, and said\nto him, "A lion slew Prasena, hunting in the forests; and now Satrajit has\nbeen murdered by \xc5\x9aatadhanwan. As both these are removed, the jewel which\nbelonged to them is our common right. Up then, ascend your car, and put\n\xc5\x9aatadhanwan to death."\n\nBeing thus excited by his brother, Balarama engaged resolutely in the\nenterprise; but \xc5\x9aatadhanwan, being aware of their hostile designs, repaired to\nKritavarman, and required his assistance. Kritavarman, however, declined to\nassist him, pleading his inability to engage in a conflict with both Baladeva\nand Krishn\xcc\x81a. \xc5\x9aatadhanwan thus disappointed, applied to Akrura; but he said,\n"You must have recourse to some other protector. How should I be able to\ndefend you? There is no one even amongst the immortals, whose praises are\ncelebrated throughout the universe, who is capable of contending with the\nwielder of the discus, at the stamp of whose foot the three worlds tremble;\nwhose hand makes the wives of the Asuras widows, whose weapons no host,\nhowever mighty, can resist: no one is capable of encountering the wielder of\nthe ploughshare, who annihilates the prowess of his enemies by the glances of\nhis eyes, that roll with the joys of wine; and whose vast ploughshare\nmanifests his might, by seizing and exterminating the most formidable foes."\n"Since this is the case," replied \xc5\x9aatadhanwan, "and you are unable to assist\nme, at least accept and take care of this jewel." "I will do so," answered\nAkrura, "if you promise that even in the last extremity you will not divulge\nits being in my possession." To this \xc5\x9aatadhanwan agreed, and Akrura took the\njewel; and the former mounting a very swift mare, one that could travel a\nhundred leagues a day, fled from Dwaraka.\n\nWhen Krishn\xcc\x81a heard of \xc5\x9aatadhanwan\'s flight, he harnessed his four horses,\n\xc5\x9aaivya, Sugriva, Meghapushpa, and Balahaka, to his car, and, accompanied by\nBalarama, set off in pursuit. The mare held her speed,\n\np. 430\n\nand accomplished her hundred leagues; but when she reached the country of\nMithila, her strength was exhausted, and she dropped down and died.\n\xc5\x9aatadhanwan 11 dismounting, continued his flight on foot. When his pursuers\ncame to the place where the mare had perished, Krishn\xcc\x81a said to Balarama, "Do\nyou remain in the car, whilst I follow the villain on foot, and put him to\ndeath; the ground here is bad; and the horses will not be able to drag the\nchariot across it." Balarama accordingly stayed with the car, and Krishn\xcc\x81a\nfollowed \xc5\x9aatadhanwan on foot: when he had chased him for two kos, he\ndischarged his discus, and, although \xc5\x9aatadhanwan was at a considerable\ndistance, the weapon struck off his head. Krishn\xcc\x81a then coining up, searched\nhis body and his dress for the Syamantaka jewel, but found it not. He then\nreturned to Balabhadra, and told him that they had effected the death of\n\xc5\x9aatadhanwan to no purpose, for the precious gem, the quintessence of all\nworlds, was not upon his person. When Balabhadra heard this, he flew into a\nviolent rage, and said to Vasudeva, "Shame light upon you, to be thus greedy\nof wealth! I acknowledge no brotherhood with you. Here lies my path. Go\nwhither you please; I have done with Dwaraka, with you, with all our house. It\nis of no use to seek to impose upon me with thy perjuries." Thus reviling his\nbrother, who fruitlessly endeavoured to appease him, Balabhadra went to the\ncity of Videha, where Janaka 12 received him hospitably, and there he\nremained. Vasudeva returned to Dwaraka. It was during his stay in the dwelling\nof Janaka that Duryodhana, the son of Dhritarasht\xcc\x81ra, learned from Balabhadra\nthe art of fighting with the mace. At the expiration of three years, Ugrasena\nand other chiefs of the Yadavas, being satisfied that Krishn\xcc\x81a had not the\njewel, went to Videha, and removed Balabhadra\'s suspicions, and brought him\nhome.\n\nAkrura, carefully considering the treasures which the precious jewel secured\nto him, constantly celebrated religious rites, and, purified with holy prayers\n13, lived in affluence for fifty-two years; and through the\n\np. 431\n\nvirtue of that gem there was no dearth nor pestilence in the whole country 14.\nAt the end of that period, \xc5\x9aatrughna, the great grandson of Satwata, was\nkilled by the Bhojas, and as they were in bonds of alliance with Akrura, he\naccompanied them in their flight from Dwaraka. From the moment of his\ndeparture various calamities, portents, snakes, dearth, plague, and the like,\nbegan to prevail; so that he whose emblem is Garuda called together the\nYadavas, with Balabhadra and Ugrasena, and recommended them to consider how it\nwas that so many prodigies should have occurred at the same time. On this\nAndhaka, one of the elders of the Yadhu race, thus spake: "Wherever \xc5\x9awaphalka,\nthe father of Akrura, dwelt, there famine, plague, dearth, and other\nvisitations were unknown. Once when there was want of rain in the kingdom of\nKasiraja, \xc5\x9awaphalka was brought there, and immediately there fell rain from\nthe heavens. It happened also that the queen of Ka\xc5\x9biraja conceived, and was\nquick with a daughter; but when the time of delivery arrived, the child issued\nnot from the womb. Twelve years passed away, and still the girl was unborn.\nThen Ka\xc5\x9biraja spake to the child, and said, \'Daughter, why is your birth thus\ndelayed? come forth; I desire to behold you, why do you inflict this\nprotracted suffering upon your mother?\' Thus addressed, the infant answered,\n\'If, father, you will present a cow every day to the Brahmans, I shall at the\nend of three years more be born.\' The king accordingly presented daily a cow\nto the Brahmans, and at the end of three years the damsel came into the world.\nHer father called her Gandini, and he subsequently gave her to \xc5\x9awaphalka, when\nhe came to his palace for his benefit. Gandini, as long as she lived, gave a\ncow to the Brahmans every day. Akrura was her\n\np. 432\n\nson by \xc5\x9awaphalka, and his birth therefore proceeds from a combination of\nuncommon excellence. When a person such as he is, is absent from us, is it\nlikely that famine, pestilence, and prodigies should fail to occur? Let him\nthen he invited to return: the faults of men of exalted worth must not be too\nseverely scrutinized."\n\nAgreeably to the advice of Audhaka the elder, the Yadavas sent a mission,\nheaded by Ke\xc5\x9bava, Ugrasena, and Balabhadra, to assure Akrura that no notice\nwould be taken of any irregularity committed by him; and having satisfied him\nthat he was in no danger, they brought him back to Dwaraka. Immediately on his\narrival, in consequence of the properties of the jewel, the plague, dearth,\nfamine, and every other calamity and portent, ceased. Krishn\xcc\x81a, observing\nthis, reflected 15 that the descent of Akrura from Gandini and \xc5\x9awaphalka was a\ncause wholly disproportionate to such an effect, and that some more powerful\ninfluence must be exerted to arrest pestilence and famine. "Of a surety," said\nhe to himself, "the great Syamantaka jewel is in his keeping, for such I have\nheard are amongst its properties. This Akrura too has been lately celebrating\nsacrifice after sacrifice; his own means are insufficient for such expenses;\nit is beyond a doubt that he has the jewel." Having come to this conclusion,\nhe called a meeting of all the Yadavas at his house, under the pretext of some\nfestive celebration. When they were all seated, and the. purport of their\nassembling had been explained, and the business accomplished, Krishn\xcc\x81a entered\ninto conversation with Akrura, and, after laughing and joking, said to him,\n"Kinsman, you are a very prince in your liberality; but we know very well that\nthe precious jewel which was stolen by Sudhanwan was delivered by him to you,\nand is now in your possession, to the great benefit of this kingdom. So let it\nremain; we all derive advantage from its virtues.\n\np. 433\n\n[paragraph continues] But Balabhadra suspects that I have it, and therefore,\nout of kindness to me, shew it to the assembly." When Akrura, who had the\njewel with him, was thus taxed, he hesitated what he should do. "If I deny\nthat I have the jewel," thought he, "they will search my person, and find the\ngem hidden amongst my clothes. I cannot submit to a search." So reflecting,\nAkrura said to Narayan\xcc\x81a, the cause of the whole world, "It is true that the\nSyamantaka jewel was entrusted to me by \xc5\x9aatadhanwan, when he went from hence.\nI expected every day that you would ask me for it, and with much inconvenience\ntherefore I have kept it until now. The charge of it has subjected me to so\nmuch anxiety, that I have been incapable of enjoying any pleasure, and have\nnever known a moment\'s ease. Afraid that you would think me unfit to retain\npossession of a jewel so essential to the welfare of the kingdom, I forbore to\nmention to you its being in my hands; but now take it yourself, and give the\ncare of it to whom you please." Having thus spoken, Akrura drew forth from his\ngarments a small gold box, and took from it the jewel. On displaying it to the\nassembly of the Yadavas, the whole chamber where they sat was illuminated by\nits radiance. "This," said Akrura, "is the Syamantaka gem, which was consigned\nto me by \xc5\x9aatadhanwan: let him to whom it belongs now take it."\n\nWhen the Yadavas beheld the jewel, they were filled with astonishment, and\nloudly expressed their delight. Balabhadra immediately claimed the jewel as\nhis property jointly with Achyuta, as formerly agreed upon; whilst Satyabhama,\ndemanded it as her right, as it had originally belonged to her father. Between\nthese two Krishn\xcc\x81a considered himself as an ox between the two wheels of a\ncart, and thus spake to Akrura in the presence of all the Yadavas: "This jewel\nhas been exhibited to the assembly in order to clear my reputation; it is the\njoint right of Balabhadra and myself, and is the patrimonial inheritance of\nSatyabhama. But this jewel, to be of advantage to the whole kingdom, should be\ntaken charge of by a person who leads a life of perpetual continence: if worn\nby an impure individual, it will be the cause of his death. Now as I have\nsixteen thousand wives, I am not qualified to have the care of it. It is not\nlikely that Satyabhama will agree to the\n\np. 434\n\nconditions that would entitle her to the possession of the jewel; and as to\nBalabhadra, he is too much addicted to wine and the pleasures of sense to lead\na life of self-denial. We are therefore out of the question, and all the\nYadavas, Balabhadra, Satyabhama, and myself, request you, most bountiful\nAkrura, to retain the care of the jewel, as you have done hitherto, for the\ngeneral good; for you are qualified to have the keeping of it, and in your\nhands it has been productive of benefit to the country. You must not decline\ncompliance with our request." Akrura, thus urged, accepted the jewel, and\nthenceforth wore it publicly round his neck, where it shone with dazzling\nbrightness; and Akrura moved about like the sun, wearing a garland of light.\n\nHe who calls to mind the vindication of the character of Krishn\xcc\x81a from false\naspersions, shall never become the subject of unfounded accusation in the\nleast degree, and living in the full exercise of his senses shall be cleansed\nfrom every sin 16.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[424:1](vp106.htm#fr_1145) The Agni acknowledges but four sons. but all the\nrest agree in the number, and mostly in the names, Mahabhoja is sometimes read\nMahabhaga.\n\n[424:2](vp106.htm#fr_1146) Krimi: Brahma, Agni, Kurma.\n\n[424:3](vp106.htm#fr_1147) Panava: Vayu.

The Matsya also names\nthe ladies, but gives Sumitra to Gandhari, and makes Madri the mother of\nYudhajit, Devamid\xcc\x81husha, Anamitra, and \xc5\x9aini.

Krishn\xcc\x81a however appears in this story\nin a very different light from that in which he is usually represented; and\nthe adventure, it may be remarked, is detached from the place in which we\nmight have expected to find it, the narrative of his life, which forms the\nsubject of the next book.\n\n[434:16](vp106.htm#fr_1160) The story of the Syamantaka gem occurs in the\nBhagavata, Vayu, Matsya, Brahma, and Hari V., and is alluded to in other\nPuran\xcc\x81as. It may be considered as one common to the whole series.\nIndependently of the part borne in it by Krishn\xcc\x81a, it presents a curious and\nno doubt a faithful picture of ancient manners, in the loose self-government\nof a kindred clan, in the acts of personal violence which are committed, in\nthe feuds which ensue, in the public meetings which are held, and the part\nthat is taken by the elders and by the women in all the proceedings of the\ncommunity.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XIV](vp107.htm)\n\n'
