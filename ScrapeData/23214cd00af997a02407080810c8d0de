And, again, (the pradhana cannot be active) because the relation of\nprincipal (and subordinate matter) is impossible (between the three gu _n_\nas).\n\nFor the following reason also activity on the part of the pradhana is not\npossible.--The condition of the pradhana\n\np. 375\n\nconsists in the three gu _n_ as, viz. goodness, passion, and darkness, abiding\nin themselves in a state of equipoise without standing to one another in the\nrelation of mutual superiority or inferiority. In that state the gu _n_ as\ncannot possibly enter into the relation of mutual subserviency because thereby\nthey would forfeit their essential characteristic, viz. absolute independence.\nAnd as there exists no extraneous principle to stir up the gu _n_ as, the\nproduction of the great principle and the other effects--which would acquire\nfor its operative cause a non-balanced state of the gu _n_ as--is impossible.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 9](sbe34185.htm)\n\n'
