This Sutra refers to the begetting of a\nKshetra _g_ a son, and gives the usual rule, that only the Sagotras in the\norder of the grade of relationship, a brother-in-law, a Sapi _n_ _d_ a, &c.,\nshall be employed for this purpose.\n\n[166:4](sbe0262.htm#fr_775) 'For now-a-days the senses of men are and\ntherefore the peculiar (law formerly) in force regarding gentiles is no\nlonger, lest husbands should be set aside under the pretended sanction of the\n_S_ astras.'--Haradatta.\n\n[166:9](sbe0262.htm#fr_776) Manu VIII, 374; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. II, 286. According to\nHaradatta, this refers to a _S_ udra servant who seduces a woman committed to\nhis charge. In other cases the punishment prescribed, II, 10, 26,10, is to\ntake effect. The same opinion is expressed by Gautama.\n\n[166:11](sbe0262.htm#fr_777) This refers to the wife of a _S_ rotriya, as\nHaradatta states according to Gautama. The penance is three years' chastity.\n\n[167:15](sbe0262.htm#fr_778) In conversation, i.e. addressing \xc3\x82ryas\nfamiliarly, with tvam, thou,' &c.\n\n[167:17](sbe0262.htm#fr_779) Haradatta states expressly that the eyes of a\nBrahma _n_ a must not be put out by any sharp instrument. He should be kept\nblindfold all his life.\n\n[167:20](sbe0262.htm#fr_780) The intercession is to take effect in this\nmanner: that mutilation is commuted to a fine, a fine to a flogging, a\nflogging to a reprimand.'--Haradatta.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 11, Kha _n_ _d_ a 28](sbe0263.htm)\n\n"
