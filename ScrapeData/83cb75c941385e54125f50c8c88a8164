But she begins with light; for thus some read in their text.\n\nThe 'but' has assertory force. 'Light' in the Sutra means Brahman, in\naccordance with the meaning of the term as known from texts such as 'On him\nthe gods meditate, the light of lights' (B _ri_. Up. X, 4, 16); 'That light\nwhich shines beyond heaven' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 13, 7). 'She begins with light'\nthus means 'she has Brahman for her cause.'--'For thus some read in their\ntext,' i.e. because the members of one _S_ akha, viz the Taittiriyas read in\ntheir\n\np. 367\n\ntext that this 'a _g_ a' has Brahman for her cause. The Mahanaraya _n_\na-Upanishad (of the Taittiriyas) at first refers to Brahman abiding in the\nhollow of the heart as the object of meditation. 'Smaller than the small,\ngreater than the great, the Self placed in the hollow of this creature'; next\ndeclares that all the worlds and Brahma and the other gods originated from\nthat Self; and then says that there sprung from it also this a _g_ a which is\nthe cause of all 'The one a _g_ a (goat), red, white and black, which gives\nbirth to numerous offspring of the same shape, one a _g_ a (he-goat) loves and\nlies by her; another one forsakes her after having enjoyed her.' The subject-\nmatter of the entire section evidently is to give instruction as to the whole\naggregate of things other than Brahman originating from Brahman and thus\nhaving its Self in it; hence we conclude that also the a _g_ a which gives\nbirth to manifold creatures like her, and is enjoyed by the soul controlled by\nkarman, while she is abandoned by the soul possessing true knowledge is, no\nless than vital airs, seas, mountains, &c., a creature of Brahman, and hence\nhas its Self in Brahman. We then apply to the interpretation of the _S_ veta\n_s_ vatara-text the meaning of the analogous Mahanaraya _n_ a-text, as\ndetermined by the complementary passages, and thus arrive at the conclusion\nthat the a _g_ a in the former text also is a being having its Self in\nBrahman. That this is so, moreover, appears from the _S_ veta _s_ vatara\nitself. For in the early part of that Upanishad, we have after the\nintroductory question, 'Is Brahman the cause?' the passage 'The sages devoted\nto meditation and concentration have seen the person whose Self is the\ndivinity, hidden in its own qualities' (I, 1, 3); which evidently refers to\nthe a _g_ a. as being of the nature of a power of the highest Brahman. And as\nfurther on also (viz. in the passages 'From that the Mayin creates all this,\nand in this the other is bound up through Maya'; 'Know then Prak _ri_ ti to be\nMaya and the Great Lord the ruler of Maya'; and 'he who rules every place of\nbirth,' V, 9-11) the very same being is referred to, there remains not even a\nshadow of proof for the assertion that the mantra under discussion\n\np. 368\n\nrefers to an independent Prak _ri_ ti as assumed by the Sa _n_ khyas.\n\nBut a further objection is raised, if the Prak _ri_ ti denoted by a _g_ a\nbegins with, i.e. is caused by Brahman, how can it be called a _g_ a, i.e. the\nnon-produced one; or, if it is non-produced, how can it be originated by\nBrahman? To this the next Sutra replies.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 10. And on account of the teaching of formation ... there is no\ncontradiction; as in the case of the honey](sbe48152.htm)\n\n"
