She sat in a room in a garden house on the bank of the Ganges. I\ncarelessly passed by without paying attention to her, when all of a sudden it\nflashed through my mind with an unutterable longing that my mother was there.\nAt once I stopped and went back to her and bowing low touched her feet with my\nhead. She held my hand, looked into my face, and said: "You have come!"\n\nIn this great world we carelessly pass by the room where Mother sits. Her\nstoreroom is open when we want our food, our bed is ready when we must sleep.\nOnly that touch and that voice are wanting. We are moving about, but never\ncoming close to the personal presence, to be held by the hand and greeted:\n"You have come!"\n\np. 4\n\nIN my early years, I did not know that my sight had become impaired. The first\nday when, by chance, I put on a pair of eye-glasses I found that I had\nsuddenly come nearer to everything. I felt I had gained the world twice as\nmuch as had been given to me the moment before.\n\nThere is such a thing as coming to the nearer presence of the world through\nthe soul. It is like a real home-coming into this world. It is gaining the\nworld more than can be measured--like gaining an instrument, not merely by\nhaving it, but by producing upon it music.\n\np. 5\n\nSPIRITUAL life is the emancipation of consciousness. Through it we find\nimmediate response of soul everywhere. Before we attain this life, we see men\nthrough the medium of self-interest, prejudice or classification, because of\nthe perpetual remoteness around us which we cannot cross over. When the veil\nis removed, we not only see the fleeting forms of the world, but come close to\nits eternal being, which is ineffable beauty.\n\nSome seek for the evidence of spiritual truth in the outside world. In this\nquest one may stumble upon ghosts or some super-sensual phenomenon of nature,\nbut these do not lead us to spiritual truth, as new words in a dictionary do\nnot give us literature.\n\np. 6\n\nTO-DAY is the special day of the yearly festival of our _asram_ , and we must\nmake time to realise in the heart of this place the truth which is beauty. And\nfor this we have lighted our lamps. In the morning, the sun came out brightly;\nin the dusk the stars held up their lights. But these were not sufficient for\nus. Until we light our own little lamps, the world of lights in the sky is in\nvain, and unless we make our own preparations, the great wealth of the world\npreparations remains waiting like a lute for the finger touch.\n\np. 7\n\nI NEED have no anxiety about the world of nature. The sun does not wait to be\ntrimmed by me.\n\nBut from the early morning all my thoughts are occupied by this little world\nof my self. Its importance is owing to the fact that I have a world given to\nme which is mine. It is great because I have the power to make it worthy of\nits relationship with me; it is great, because by its help I can offer my own\nhospitality to the God of all the world.\n\np. 8\n\nIN our everyday world we live in poverty; our resources have to be husbanded\nwith care; our strength becomes exhausted, and we come to our God as beggars\nfor our joy of life. On festival days, we display our wealth and say to Him\nthat we are even as He is; and we are not afraid to spend. This is the day\nwhen we bring to Him our own gift of joy. For we truly meet God, when we come\nto Him with our offerings and not with our wants.\n\np. 9\n\nLIFE\'S highest opportunity is to be able to offer hospitality to our God. We\nlive in God\'s world and forget Him, for the blind acceptance which is onesided\nnever finds its truth. It is a desert which receives rain but never offers\nfruit in return and its receiving has no meaning. God\'s world is given to us\nand when we offer our world to God then the gift is realised.\n\np. 10\n\nWHEN I had thrust the great world unnoticed behind the bars of my office habit\nI developed in me the belief that I was indispensable. Of the many means by\nwhich Nature exacts work from man, this pride is one of the most efficient.\nThose who work for money, work only to the extent of their wages, up to a\ndefinite point, beyond which they would count it a loss to work. But those\nwhose pride impels them to work, they have no rest; even over-time work is not\nfelt as a loss by them.\n\nSo busy used I to be under the belief that I was indispensable, that I hardly\ndared to wink. My doctor now and again would warn me, saying: "Stop, take it\neasy." But I would reply: "How will things go on if I stop?" Just then my\nhealth failed me, the wheels of my car broke down and it came to a stop\nbeneath this window. From here I looked out upon the limitless space. There I\nsaw whirling the numberless flashing wheels of the triumphal chariot of time,\n--no dust raised, no din, not even a scratch left on the roadway. On a sudden\nI came to myself. I clearly perceived p. 11 that things could get along\nwithout me. There was no sign that those wheels would stop, or drag the least\nbit, for lack of anyone in particular.\n\nBut is this to be admitted so easily as all that! Even if I admit it in words,\nmy mind refuses assent. If it be really quite the same whether I go or stay,\nhow then did my pride of self find a place in the universe, even for a moment?\nOn what could it have taken its stand? Amidst all the plentifulness with which\nspace and time are teeming, it was nevertheless not possible to leave out this\nself of mine. The fact that I am indispensable is proved by the fact that _I\nam_.\n\np. 12\n\nEGOISM is the price paid for the fact of existence. So long as I realise this\nprice within me, so long do I steadfastly bear all the pains and penalties of\nkeeping myself in existence. That is why the Buddhists have it, that to\ndestroy egoism is to cut at the root of existence: for, without the pride of\nself it ceases to be worth while to exist.\n\nHowever that may be, this price has been furnished from some fund or other,--\nin other words, it matters somewhere that I should be, and the price paid is\nthe measure of how much it matters. The whole universe--every molecule and\natom of it--is assisting this desire that I should be. And it is the glory of\nthis desire which is manifest in my pride of self. By virtue of this glory\nthis infinitesimal "I" is not lower than any other thing in this Universe, in\nmeasure or value.\n\np. 13\n\nMAN has viewed the desire in him to be in two different ways. Some have held\nit to be an impulse of Creative Power, some a joyous self-expression of\nCreative Love. And man sets before himself different goals as the object of\nhis life according as he views the fact of his _being_ as the revealment of\nForce or of Love.\n\nThe value which our entity receives from Power is quite different in its\naspect from that which it receives from Love. The direction in which we are\nimpelled by our pride, in the field of power, is the opposite of that given by\nour pride, in the field of Love.\n\np. 14\n\nPOWER can be measured. Its volume, its weight, its momentum can all be brought\nwithin the purview of mathematics. So it is the endeavour of those who hold\npower to be supreme, to increase in bulk. They would repeatedly multiply\nnumbers,--the number of men, the number of coins, the number of appliances.\nWhen they strive for success they sacrifice others\' wealth, others\' rights,\nothers\' lives; for sacrifice is the essence of the cult of Power; and the\nearth is running red with the blood of that sacrifice.\n\nThe distinctive feature of materialism is the measurability of its outward\nexpression, which is the same thing as the finiteness of its boundaries. And\nthe disputes, civil and criminal, which have raged in the history of man, have\nmostly been over these same boundaries. To increase one\'s own bounds one has\nnecessarily to encroach upon those of others. So, because the pride of Power\nis the pride of quantity, the most powerful telescope, when pointed in the\ndirection of Power, fails to reveal the shore of peace across the sea of\nblood.\n\np. 14\n\nBUT when engaged in adding up the quantities of these forces and facts of\npower, we do not find them to be an ever-increasing series. In our pursuit of\nthe principle of accumulation we are all of a sudden held up by stumbling upon\nthe principle of check which bars the way. We discover that there is not only\nonward motion, but there are also pauses. And we repeatedly find in history\nthat whenever the blindness of Power has tried to overrule this rule of\nrhythm, it has committed suicide. And that is why man still remembers the\nstory of the toppling over of the tower of Babylon.\n\nSo we see that the principle of Power, of which the outward expression is\nbulk, is neither the final nor the supreme Truth. It has to stop itself to\nkeep time with the rhythm of the universe. Restraint is the gateway of the\nGood. The value of the Good is not measured in terms of dimension or\nmultitude. He who has known it within himself feels no shame in rags and\ntatters. He rolls his crown in the dust and marches out on the open road.\n\np. 16\n\nWHEN from the principle of Power we arrive at the principle of Beauty, we at\nonce understand that, all this while, we had been offering incense at the\nwrong shrine; that Power grows bloated on the blood of its victims only to\nperish of surfeit; that try as we may by adding to armies and armaments, by\nincreasing the number and variety of naval craft, by heaping up our share of\nthe loot of war, arithmetic will never serve to make true that which is\nuntrue; that at the end we shall die crushed under the weight of our\nmultiplication of things.\n\nWhen the _Rishi_ , _Yajnavalkya_ , on the eve of his departure, offered to\nleave his wife _Maitreyi_ well-established upon an enumeration of what he had\ngathered together during his life, she exclaimed:\n\n_What am I to do with these, which are not of the immortal spirit_?\n\nOf what avail is it to add and add and add? By going on increasing the volume\nof pitch of sound we can get nothing but a shriek. We can p. 17 gain music\nonly by restraining the sound and giving it the melody of the rhythm of\nperfection.\n\nMan grows gigantic by the appropriation of everything for himself: he attains\nharmony by giving himself up. In this harmony is peace,--never the outcome of\nexternal organization or of coalition between power and power,--the peace\nwhich rests on truth and consists in curbing of greed, in the forgiveness of\nsympathy.\n\np. 18\n\nTHE question is: "In which Truth is my entity to realise its fullest value,--\nin Power or in Love?" If we accept Power as that truth we must also recognise\nconflict as inevitable and eternal. According to many European writers the\nReligion of Peace and Love is but a precarious coat of armour within which the\nweak seek shelter, but for which the laws of nature have but scant respect.\nThat which the timid preachers of religion anathematise as unrighteousness,--\nthat alone is the sure road which leads man to success.\n\nThe opposite school do not wholly deny this. They admit the premises but they\nsay:\n\n_Adharm \xc4\x93naidhat\xc4\x93 t\xc4\x81bat, tato bhadr\xc4\x81ni pashyati, tatah sapatn\xc4\x81n jayati,--\nsam\xc5\xablastu vinashyati_.\n\n_In unrighteousness they prosper, in it they find their good, through it they\ndefeat their enemies,--but they perish at the root_.\n\np. 19\n\nIT is still dark. The day is about to dawn. The stall-keepers, who gathered\nfor the festival fair, have spent the winter night singing round the lighted\nfires. Now they are preparing to disperse. Their noise, unlike the birds\'\nnotes, disturbs the morning peace.\n\nFor man stands at the parting of the ways. His strings have to be tuned for a\ndeeper and a more complex music than those of nature. Man has his mind which\nreasons, and his will which seeks its own path. These have not yet found their\nfull harmony with their surroundings. Therefore they are apt to break out in\nthe ugliness of discord.\n\nBut in this very ugliness lies the great hope of the future. For these\ndiscords are not mere facts which we are compelled to acknowledge; they are\nugly facts. This itself asserts every moment, that they are not what they\nshould be; they are incomplete, and they are hopeful because they are painful.\n\np. 20\n\nWE are like a stray line of a poem, which ever feels that it rhymes with\nanother line and must find it, or miss its own fulfilment. This quest of the\nunattained is the great impulse in man which brings forth all his best\ncreations. Man seems deeply to be aware of a separation at the root of his\nbeing, he cries to be led across it to a union; and somehow he knows that it\nis love which can lead him to a love which is final.\n\np. 21\n\nI HAVE a relationship with the world which is deeply personal. It is not of\nmere knowledge and use. All our relationships with facts have an infinite\nmedium which is Law, _Satyam_ ; all our relationship with truth has an\ninfinite medium [which](errata.htm#0) is Reason, _gn \xc4\x81nam_; all our personal\nrelationship has an infinite medium, which is Love, _\xc4\x81 nandam_.\n\nWe are not mere facts in this world, like pieces of stones; we are persons.\nAnd therefore we cannot be content with drifting along the stream of\ncircumstances. We have a central ideal of love with which to harmonise our\nexistence, we have to manifest a truth in our life, which is the perfect\nrelationship with the Eternal Person.\n\np. 22\n\nLAST night when the north wind was keen, like a sharp blade of steel, the\nstall-keepers improvised some kind of shelter with twigs and leaves. With all\nits flimsiness it was the most important necessity for them, for the time. But\nthis morning, before it is light, we hear them shouting for their bullocks and\ndragging out from underneath the trees their creaking carts. It is urgently\nimportant for them now to leave their shelter.\n\n"I want" has its constant counterweight--"I do not want." Otherwise the\nmonster necessity, with its immovable weight, would crush all existence. For\nthe moment we may sigh at the fact that nothing remains for long, but we are\nsaved from permanent despair at the calamity that nothing moves at all. Things\nremain and things move--between these two contrary currents we have found our\ndwelling-place and freedom.\n\np. 23\n\nTHE horse harnessed to a carriage is only a part of it, the master is he who\ndrives it unattached. We are enjoined to work with vigour and yet retain our\ndetachment of mind. For our deeds must express our freedom above all,\notherwise we become like wheels revolving because compelled. There is a\nharmony between doing and not doing, between gaining and renouncing which we\nmust attain.\n\nOur daily flow of prayer carries our self into the supreme Self, it makes us\nfeel the reality of that fulness which we gain by utterly giving ourselves up,\nmakes our consciousness expand in a large world of peace, where movements are\nbeauty and all relations are truths because of their inner freedom, which is\ndisinterestedness.\n\np. 24\n\nOUR will attains its perfection when it is one with love, for only love is\ntrue freedom. This freedom is not in the negation of restraint. It\nspontaneously accepts bondage, because bondage does not bind it, but only\nmeasures its truth. Non-slavery is in the cessation of service, but freedom is\nin service itself.\n\nA village poet of Bengal says:\n\n"In love the end is neither pain nor pleasure, but love only.  \nLove gives freedom while it binds, for love is what unites."\n\np. 25\n\nLOVE is not a mere impulse, it must contain truth, which is law. It accepts\nlimitations from truth because of its own inner wealth. The child willingly\nexercises restraint to correct its bodily balance, because it has true\npleasure in the freedom of its movements; and love also counts no cost as too\ngreat to realise its truth. Poetry is much more strict in its form of\nexpression than prose, because poetry has the freedom of joy in its origin and\nend. Our love of God is accurately careful of its responsibilities. It is\naustere in its probity and it must have intellect for its ally. Since what it\ndeals with is immense in value, it has to be cautious about the purity of its\ncoins. Therefore, when our soul cries for the gift of immortality, its first\nprayer is,--"Lead me from the unreal to Truth."\n\np. 26\n\nTHE Father is working in his world, but the Beloved is lying asleep in our\nheart, in the depth of its darkness. He will wake only when our own love\nwakes. It may sound paradoxical to say that we are unconscious of our own\nlove, as we are unconscious of the fact that the earth is carrying us round\nthe sun. But the truth is that all parts of our nature are not fully\nilluminated, and in most cases we have the immediate knowledge of ourselves\nonly on the surface where our mind is occupied with the temporary needs and\nferments of our life.\n\np. 27\n\nTO wake up in love is not to wake up in a world of sweetness, but in the world\nof heroic endeavours where life wins its eternity through death, and joy its\nworth in suffering. As the most positive affirmation of truth is in love, it\nmust realise itself through all that threatens us with deprivation. Poverty is\nafraid of the smallest loss, and wealth is daring in its expenditure. Love is\nthe wealth of soul and therefore it reveals itself in utmost bravery and\nfortitude. And because it finds its resource in itself it begs not praise from\nmen and no punishment can reach it from outside.\n\np. 28\n\nTHE world of things in which we live misses its equilibrium when its\ncommunication with the world of love is lost. Then we have to pay with our\nsoul for objects which are immensely cheap. And this can only happen when the\nprison walls of things threaten us with being final in themselves. Then it\ngives rise to terrible fights, jealousies and coercions, to a scramble for\nspace and opportunities, for these are limited. We become painfully aware of\nthe evil of this and try all measure of adjustment within the narrow bounds of\na mutilated truth. This leads to failures. Only he helps us who proves by his\nlife that we have a soul whose dwelling is in the kingdom of love, and things\nlose the tyranny of fictitious price when we come to our spiritual freedom.\n\np. 29\n\nIT is hard for us to free ourselves from the grip of our acquisitions. For the\npull of their gravitation is towards the centre of our self. The force of\nperfect love acts towards the contrary direction. And this is why love gives\nus freedom from the weight of things. Therefore our days of joy are our days\nof expenditure. It is not the lightness of pressure in the outside world which\nwe need in order to be free, but love which has the power to bear the world\'s\nweight, not only with ease, but with joy.\n\np. 30\n\nONLY because we have closed our path to the inner world of freedom, has the\nouter world become terrible in its exactions. It is slavery to continue to\nlive in a sphere where things are, yet their meaning is obstructed. It has\nbecome possible for men to say that existence is evil only because, in our\nblindness, we have missed something in which our existence has its truth. If a\nbird tries to soar in the sky with only one of its wings, it is offended with\nthe wind for buffeting it down to the dust. All broken truths are evil. They\nhurt, because they suggest something which they do not offer. Death does not\nhurt us, but disease does, because disease constantly reminds us of health and\nyet withholds it from us. And life in a half world is evil, because it feigns\nfinality when it is obviously incomplete, giving us the cup but not the\ndraught of life.\n\np. 31\n\nCOMING to the theatre of life we foolishly sit with our back to the stage. We\nsee the gilded pillars and decorations, we watch the coming and going of the\ncrowd; and when the light is put out at the end, we ask ourselves in\nbewilderment, what is the meaning of it all? If we paid attention to the inner\nstage, we could witness the eternal love drama of the soul and be assured that\nit has pauses, but no end, and that the gorgeous world-preparations are not a\nmagnificent delirium of things.\n\np. 32\n\nWE criticise Nature from outside when we separate it in our mind from human\nnature, and blame it for being devoid of pity and justice. Let the wick burn\nwith indignation at the want of light in the rest of the candle, but the truth\nis that the wick represents the whole candle in its illumination. Obstacles\nare necessary companions to expression, and we know that the positive element\nin language is not in its obstructiveness. Exclusively viewed from the side of\nthe obstacle, Nature appears as inimical to the idea of morality. But if that\nwere absolutely true, moral life could never come to exist. Life, moral or\nphysical, is not a completed fact, but is a continual process, depending for\nits movement upon two contrary forces, the force of resistance and that of\nexpression. Dividing these forces into two mutually opposing principles does\nnot help us, for the truth dwells not in the opposition but in its continual\nreconciliation.\n\np. 33\n\nGOOD taste which is needful for the true understanding of a poem, comes from\nthe vision of unity seen in the light of imagination. Faith has the similar\nfunction in our acceptance of life. It is a spiritual organ of sight which\nenables us instinctively to realise the vision of wholeness when in fact we\nonly see the parts. Sceptics may scoff at this vision as an hallucination,\nthey may select and arrange facts in such a manner as to disprove it and yet\nfaith never doubts its own direct apprehension of the inner truth which binds,\nwhich builds, which heals, which leads to an ideal of fullness. Faith is this\nspontaneous response in our being to the voice of the all-pervading Yes, and\ntherefore it is the greatest of all creative forces in human life. It is not\nmerely a passive acknowledgment of truth, it is an ever active effort for\nattaining harmony with that peace which is in the rhythm of truth in creation,\ngoodness which is in the rhythm of combination in society, and unity of love\nwhich is in the rhythm of self-realisation in soul. The mere fact of\ninnumerable breaks in such a rhythm no more proves its unreality p. 34 to a\nman gifted with faith than the prevalent fact of harsh notes and noises\ndisproves the truth of music to a musician. It only calls him to a strenuous\nendeavour to mend the break and establish harmony with truth.\n\np. 35\n\nTHE day breaks in the east, like a bud bursting its sheath to come out in\nflower. But if this fact belonged only to the outside world of events, however\ncould we find our entrance into it? It is a sunrise in the sky of our\nconsciousness, it is a new creation, fresh in bloom, in our life.\n\nOpen your eyes and see. Feel this world as a living flute might feel the\nbreath of music passing through it, feel the meeting of creative joy in the\ndepth of your consciousness. Meet this morning light in the majesty of your\nexistence, where it is one with you. But if you sit with your face turned\naway, you build a separating barrier in the undivided sphere of creation,\nwhere events and the creative consciousness meet.\n\np. 36\n\nDARKNESS is that which isolates our consciousness within our own self. It\nhides the great truth of our unity with the world, giving rise to doubt and\ncontention. Groping in the dark, we stumble against objects to which we cling,\nbelieving them to be the only things we have. When light comes we slacken our\nhold, finding them to be mere parts of the all to which we are related. This\nis freedom--freedom from the isolation of self, from the isolation of things\nwhich impart fierce intensity to our sense of possession. Our God is that\nfreedom, for He is Light, and in that light we find out truth, which is our\nperfect relationship with all.\n\np. 37\n\nFEAR assumes unlimited dimensions in the dark, because it is the shadow of the\nself which has lost its foothold in the all; the self which is a doubter, an\nunbeliever, which puts its emphasis upon negation, exaggerating detached facts\ninto fearful distortions. In the light we find the harmony of things and know\nthat our world is great and therefore we are great; we know that, with more\nand more extensive realisation of truth, conflicts will vanish, for existence\nitself is harmony.\n\np. 38\n\nIN Nature we find the presence of law in truth, and the presence of joy in\nbeauty. It is urgently necessary for us to know truth, but we are free to\nignore the presence of joy. It is not safe for our life to forget that it\nbecomes light in the morning; but we can safely forget that morning is\nbeautiful, and yet live.\n\nIn this realm of truth we are bound, in the realm of beauty we are free. We\nmust pay our homage to God where He rules; but we may laugh at Him where He\nloves. He keeps us bound where He binds Himself, He gives us freedom where He\nis infinite. The great power of beauty is in its modesty. It makes way for the\nleast of us, it waits in silence. It must have our all or nothing, therefore\nit never asks. It suffers meekly when it is refused, but it has its eternity.\n\np. 39\n\nAN acquaintance of mine has suddenly died and once again I come to know death,\nthe tritest of all truisms in this world.\n\nThe moralist teaches us to know the world as unreal through the contemplation\nof death. But to make renunciation easy by calling the world names is neither\ntrue, nor brave. For that renunciation is no renunciation at all in which\nthings have lost their value.\n\nOn the contrary, the world is so true, that death\'s wheel leaves no mark upon\nit. The untruth is in the belief that this self of ours for its own permanent\nuse can rob this world of even a particle of its things. Death has its concern\nonly with our self and not with this world. The world never loses an atom, it\nis our self which suffers.\n\np. 40\n\nTHERE are men whose idea of life is static, who long for its continuation\nafter death only because of their wish for permanence and not perfection; they\nlove to imagine that the things to which they are accustomed will persist for\never. They completely identify themselves in their minds with their fixed\nsurroundings and with whatever they have gathered, and to have to leave these\nis death for them. They forget that the true meaning of living is outliving,\nit is ever growing out of itself. The fruit clings to its stem, its skin\nclings to the pulp and the pulp to the seed so long as the fruit is immature,\nso long as it is not ready for its course of further life. Its outer covering\nand its inner core are not yet differentiated and it only proves its life by\nits strength of tenacity. But when the seed is ripe its hold upon its\nsurrounding is loosened, its pulp attains fragrance, sweetness and detachment,\nand is dedicated to all who need it. Birds peck at it and it is not hurt, the\nstorm plucks it and flings it to the dust and it is not destroyed. It proves\nits immortality by its renunciation.\n\np. 41\n\nIN Hindu scriptures this world is considered to be an egg. If that be true,\nthen this egg must have for its content a living being whose fulfillment is to\nbreak through its shell into a freer existence.\n\nWhile our world feeds us, gives us shelter, it encloses us all around. The\nlimitedness of our narrow sensibility and range of thought build the shell of\nour world egg, within which our consciousness is confined. If we could widen\nits boundaries even by a small fraction, if some of the invisible rays could\ncome within our sphere of perception, if few more of the dance rhythms of\ncreation could find response in some added strings of our senses, then the\nwhole aspect of our world would be completely changed.\n\nTo come out of the bounds of our sensibility and mental vision into a wider\nfreedom is the meaning of our immortality. Can we imagine in our present stage\nof confinement what that sphere of freedom is like? From the data of all the\nfacts within the shell can a chick ever form the idea of the world to which it\nis to be born?\n\np. 42\n\nTHE passivity which is the predominant fact of the shell life is secretly\ncontradicted by the rudimentary wings. Likewise in the confinement of our\npresent state, in spite of the fact that a great part of our life is passively\nobedient to circumstances, there struggles in us our aspiration for freedom\nagainst impediments that appear to be ultimate. This is our spiritual pair of\nwings which have their significance in a full opportunity to soar. Had\nimmortality only meant an endless persistence of our shell itself then we\nshould admit that these impotent wings were cursed by an evil power with an\neternity of hindrance. But this we cannot admit. Man has ever talked of\nemancipation from what is present, from what seems final. While the spirit of\nlife in him seeks continuance the spirit of immortality seeks emancipation.\n\np. 43\n\nTHE life of the seed within the fruit is absolutely different from its life of\ngrowth as a tree. The life which is bound on all sides within the environment\nof our self, within the limited range of our senses must be so fundamentally\ndifferent from the life of an emancipated soul that it is impossible to\nimagine the latter while we are immured in the sheath of self. And therefore\nin our desire for eternal life we pray for an eternity of our habit and\ncomfort, forgetting that immortality is in repeatedly transcending the\ndefinite forms of life in order to pursue the infinite truth of life. Those\nwho think that life\'s true meaning is in the persistence of its particular\nforms which are familiar to us are like misers who have not the power to know\nthat the meaning of money can only be found by spending it, by changing the\nsymbol into truth.\n\np. 44\n\nALL our desires are but focussing our will to a limited range of experience.\nThese become jealously tenacious and combative when we fail to imagine that\nour experience will widen. In our childhood we wished for an unbounded\ncontinuity in our enjoyment of a particular food or game and we refused to\nbelieve in the worth of a mature age which had different interests altogether.\nThose who build their vision of a life after death upon the foundation of\ndesires belonging to the present life merely show their want of faith in\nEternal life. They cling to what they have because they cannot believe that\ntheir love for the present is only an indication that this love will persist\nthrough their growth, stimulating it, and not that it will retard their growth\naltogether.\n\np. 45\n\nTHE world of sleep is fundamental,--it is the world of the mother\'s womb. It\nis the world where the grass and the trees live and find their beauty of\nreposefulness. Our consciousness has freed itself from its embrace, asserting\nits independence. It is the freedom of the fountain which must come over and\nover again to its origin to renew its play. The whole depth and spread of the\nstill water finds its own play in the play of this little fountain. In like\nmanner, it is in our own consciousness that the universe knows itself.\nTherefore this consciousness has to be great in order to be true. Our\nconsciousness is the music of the world, its dance, its poem. It has its\npauses in the bosom of the original sleep, to be fed with immortality at her\nbreast.\n\np. 46\n\nIN man\'s nature there is a division between the fleeting and the permanent,\nwhich the animals have not, because they live on the surface of life.\nTherefore they are saved from the danger of trying to give permanence to\nthings which have not that quality in themselves. Only because man has to a\ngreat extent a preservative power in his inner world, does he try in his greed\nto keep his appetites ever fresh, steeping them in the elixir of imagination.\nThese appetites are of outer nature, and for the animals they quit the stage\nwhen they have played their parts. But when we try to hoard them in our inner\nlife we wrongly put upon them the seal of the infinite. Thus our land of\nimmortality is every day being invaded by the retinue of death, and the\nservants who ought to be dismissed with their wages paid, are enshrined in our\nsanctuary.\n\np. 47\n\nWEALTH is the symbol of power. There-fore, wealth must move and flow in order\nto be perfect. For power is active, it is movement. But mere movement is\nsuperficial. It must be a growth and therefore continual gaining. This gain is\nsomething which not merely moves, but remains.\n\nThe highest harmony of movement and rest is in the spiritual life, whose\nessence is love. Love of God, nay, love in all forms, is the reaching of the\ngoal and yet never coming to a stop. Power, when it reaches its end, stops and\ngrows careful of its hoarding. Love, when it reaches its end, reaches\nendlessness and therefore is not afraid of spending its all.\n\np. 48\n\nBEING by nature social, some portion of our energies we must employ to keep up\nthe flow of sociality. But its field and action are on the surface. The\nripples of gregariousness are not the deep currents of human love. The men who\nhave strong social instincts are not necessarily lovers of men.\n\nThe men who are spendthrifts very often lack true generosity. In most cases\nthey cannot give, but can only spend. And also like them the social men can\nspend themselves, but not give themselves. This reckless spending creates a\nvacuum which we fill up with the debris of activities, whose object is to bury\ntime.\n\np. 49\n\nBUT we cannot afford to fritter away our solitude where lies the throne of the\ninfinite. We cannot truly live for one another, if we never claim the freedom\nto live alone, if our social duties consist in helping one another to forget\nthat we have souls. To exhaust ourselves completely in mere efforts to give\ncompany to each other, is to cheat the world of our best, the best which is\nthe product of the amplitude of our inner atmosphere of leisure. Society\npoisons the air it breathes, where it hems in the individual with a revolving\ncrowd of distractions.\n\np. 50\n\nIN our country it is accounted the greatest calamity to have one\'s courtyard\nbrought under the plough. Because, in the courtyard, man has made his very own\nthe immense wealth called space. Space is not a rare commodity outside, but\none does not _get_ it till he can bring it inside and make it his own. The\nspace of the courtyard, man has made part of his home. Here the light of the\nsun is revealed as his own light, and here his baby claps his little hands to\ncall to the moon. So if the courtyard be not kept open, but be used for sowing\ncrops, then is the nest destroyed in which the outside Universe can come and\ndwell as man\'s own universe.\n\np. 51\n\nTHE difference between a really rich man and a poor man is, that the former\ncan afford vast open spaces in his home. The furniture with which a rich man\nencumbers his house may be valuable, but the space with which he makes his\ncourtyard wide, his garden extensive, is of infinitely greater value. The\nbusiness place of the merchant is crowded with his stock,--there he has not\nthe means of keeping spaces vacant, there he is miserly, and millionaire\nthough he be, there he is poor. But in his home that same merchant flouts mere\nutility by the length and breadth and height of his room--to say nothing of\nthe expanse of his garden--and gives to space the place of honour. It is here\nthat the merchant is rich.\n\nNot only unoccupied space, but unoccupied time, also, is of the highest value.\nThe rich man out of his abundance, can purchase leisure. It is in fact a test\nof his riches, this power to keep fallow wide stretches of time, which want\ncannot compel him to plough up.\n\nThere is yet another place where an open expanse is the most valuable of all,\n--and that is p. 52 in the mind. Thoughts which must be thought, from which\nthere is no escape, are but worries. The thoughts of the poor and the\nmiserable cling to their minds as the ivy to a ruined temple.\n\nPain closes up all openings of the mind. Health may be defined as the state in\nwhich the physical consciousness lies fallow, like an open heath. Let there be\nbut a touch of gout in the remotest toe and the whole of consciousness is\nfilled with pain, leaving not a corner empty.\n\nJust as one cannot live grandly without unoccupied spaces, so the mind cannot\nthink grandly without unoccupied leisure,--otherwise for it truth becomes\npetty. And like dim light, petty truth distorts vision, encourages fear, and\nkeeps narrow the field of communion between man and man.\n\np. 53\n\nIN society, we find our places according to a certain conventional price set\nupon us, like toys arranged in the shop windows, according to their value.\nThis makes us forget that we are not for sale, that the social man is not the\nwhole man.\n\nI have known a fisherman singing, while fishing all day in the Ganges, who was\npointed out to me by my boatman with awe as a man possessed by God. He is out\nof reach of the fluctuation of market prices, for he has found out the\ninfinite value of the soul which the monarchs of the world have not. In\nhistory there were men who are still recognized by their eternal worth; but\nthis recognition is not the only proof of their value. For immortality is not\nin its outer manifestation, and dark rays are rays all the same, though we do\nnot see them. The figure of this fisherman comes to my mind when I think that\ntheir number is not small who with their lives sing the epic of the freedom of\nsoul, but will never be known in history.\n\np. 54\n\nOUR aspiration becomes easy when through us our community aspires. Money-\nmaking is pursued by most men, not merely because money is useful, but rather\nbecause it is desired by others. The savages\' lust for head-hunting becomes\nirresistible when it is prevalent in the community. When the majority wishes\nthrough us, we are ready to sacrifice truth to its claims.\n\nDoubts assail us and strength fails in our aspiration for spiritual life\nchiefly because it is not the aspiration of the surrounding crowd. Therefore\nour wish for the highest has to be so immensely true, so that it can sustain\nitself in all circumstances against the constant pressure of the crowd\'s wish.\nWe need all the succour of the eternal to fight against the combined\nantagonism of the congregated moments.\n\np. 55\n\nOUR thoughts naturally move in their surrounding element of man\'s mind, like\nbirds in the air. This sky of mind is perpetually troubled by contrary wind-\ncurrents, by doubts and denials, by levity and pride; it is obscured by the\ndust and smoke of the busy world. Our spiritual wings require spontaneity of\nspeed, grace of perfect movement; but when they are constantly buffeted by\nnoisy gusts from all sides it makes us too conscious of our limitations, and\nconsequently that self-abandonment becomes difficult which is necessary for\nour communion with the Infinite. And yet the task has to be done and the most\ndifficult path taken for the highest attainment of life. The great teachers\nhave ever won that infinity of solitude needed for soul\'s meeting with her\nGod, through the crowd and for the crowd themselves. In the lives of these men\nwe witness the proof of our own limitless power, and the faith that we thus\ngain gives freedom to our aspiration in the face of adversity.\n\np. 56\n\nSOME part of the earth\'s water becomes rarefied and ascends to the skies. With\nthe movement and the music it acquires in those pure heights it then showers\ndown, back to the water of the earth, making it wholesome and fresh.\nSimilarly, part of the mind of humanity rises up out of the world and flies\nskywards; but this sky-soaring mind attains completeness only when it has\nreturned, to mingle with the earth-bound mind. This is the ventilation of\nreligion, the circulation of man\'s ideals between heaven and earth.\n\np. 57\n\nTHERE are the rain of mud, the rain of blood, and such like dire phenomena of\nwhich we hear tell. These happen when the purity of the atmosphere is sullied\nand the air is burdened with dirt. Then it is not the song of the sky which\ndescends in purifying showers, but just the earth\'s own sins which fall back\non it. Then our religion itself grows muddy, the collective egoism of the\npeople assumes pious names, and we boast of our God taking the lead in our\nadventures of sell-seeking, in our campaign of hatred.\n\np. 58\n\nTO-DAY on the sin-laden dust of the earth pours tainted rain from the sky. Our\nlong wait for the cleansing bath in pure water from on high has been\nrepeatedly doomed to disappointment; the mud is soiling our minds and marks of\nblood are also showing. How long can we keep on wiping this away? Even the\npure silence of the empyrean is powerless to clarify the discordant notes of\nthe prayer for peace which is rising from a blood-stained world.\n\nPeace? Who can truly pray for Peace? Only they who are ready to renounce.\n\nAtha dheer\xc4\x81 amrtatvam viditv\xc4\x81  \nDruvam adhruv\xc4\x93shviha na pr\xc4\x81rthayant\xc4\x93.\n\nMen of tranquil mind, being sure of Immortal Truth, never seek the eternal in\nthings of the moment.\n\np. 59\n\nOUR greatest men have shown immense respect for mankind in their expectations.\nWe come to believe in ourselves because of what is asked of us. Practical men\nbase their arrangements upon their estimates of man\'s limitations. Therefore\nthe great creations of history, the creations that have their foundation upon\nthe faith in the infinite in man, have not their origin in the common-sense of\npractical men. When Buddha said to men: "Spread thy thoughts of love beyond\nlimits," when Christ said: "Love thine enemies," their words transcended the\naverage standard of ideals belonging to the ordinary world. But they ever\nremind us that our true life is not the life of the ordinary world, and we\nhave a fund of resources in us which is inexhaustible. It is not for us to\ndespair, because the highest hope for mankind has been uttered by the great\nwords of great men.\n\np. 60\n\nIT is an important duty for man so to bear himself that he may not fail to be\nrecognized as man,--not only in his own interest, but because of his\nresponsibilities to others. The man who belittles himself lowers not only his\nown value but that of all mankind. Man knows himself as great where he sees\ngreat men,--and the truer is such vision of greatness, the easier it becomes\nto be great.\n\np. 61\n\nTO fledgeling birds flight in the sky may appear incredible. They may with\napparent reason measure the highest limit of their possibilities by the\nlimited standard of their nests. But, in the meanwhile, they find that their\nfood is not grown inside those nests, it is brought to them across the\nmeasureless blue. There is a silent voice that speaks to them, that they are\nmore than what they are, and that they must not laugh at the message of\nsoaring wings and glad songs of freedom.\n\np. 62\n\nTHE more we feel afraid of pain, the more we build all kinds of hiding places\nin which to hide ourselves from our own truth. Our wealth and honour are\nbarricades that keep us at arm\'s length from the touch of our own true selves.\nThus we become more familiar with that which we have, than that which we are.\nOur sufferings seek us out through our protections; they take away our\nartificial props and set us face to face with our naked loneliness.\n\nThis stripping bare of our deeper selves is not only necessary for self-\nexploration and the discovery of our innermost resources, but it is also\nneeded for our purification. For beneath our safe cover of prosperity and\ncomfort, dirt and dead matter gather every day waiting to be cleared by the\nrude rubbing of pain.\n\np. 63\n\nTHE old is prudent but is not wise. Wisdom is that freshness of mind which\nenables one to realise that truth is not hoarded in caskets of maxims, it is\nfree and living. Great sufferings lead us to wisdom because these are the\nbirth-throes through which our mind is freed from its habit-environment, and\ncomes naked into the arms of reality. Wisdom has the character of the child\nperfected through knowledge and feeling.\n\np. 64\n\nMORNING has its birds\' songs, and life\'s daybreak has the music of the child.\nAt every home comes to us this refrain of life with its pure notes of beauty.\nThe bloom constantly is brushed off the world of man by the friction of its\ndirt, it is roughened and begrimed by the callous touch of age; yet there\nflows unobstructed the daily renewal of humanity in its ceaseless rebirths.\nThe eternal repeats its call at man\'s gate in every child, and the morning\'s\nmessage keeps its melody unimpaired.\n\nIt rouses response to-day in my heart, the life\'s awakening call that comes\nfrom the children\'s shouts and songs round me, and I feel that creation finds\nits own true voice in them, the creation which keeps nestled in its heart the\nspirit of the child.\n\np. 65\n\nTHIS symphony made of the morning light and children\'s mirth does not speak to\nme of pure joy. For in my heart it mingles with another strain which tempers\nits sparkle with a shade of sadness. It is a cry of unattained harmony,\nunfulfilled hope. The simple notes of ideal completeness, dash themselves\nagainst life\'s complexities, rugged with flaws and fractures, and a sob of\nanguish spreads over our thoughts. For pain finds its own music in the notes\nthat joy brings to it from heaven, as the pebbles find theirs from the flow of\nthe laughing stream.\n\np. 66\n\nEXISTENCE is the play of the fountain of immortality. Wash your soul with its\nwater, you who are old, and feel that you are of the same age with the flower\nthat has blossomed this morning and with this light which carries fresh in its\ncountenance the first smile of creation. This is freedom, freedom from the\nmist which for the time being masks our spirit with the semblance of blurred\nage, hiding from us the truth that we are the children of the immortal. Could\nthe child bring such a joy to the heart of man if age and death were true?\nDoes not that joy come from a direct recognition of the truth of deathless\nlife, of endless growth and ever-renewed hope of perfection?\n\np. 67\n\nTO alleviate pain, to try to remove its causes, are worthy of man. All the\nsame, we must know that a great part of our sufferings has to be ascribed to\nthe beginning of our entrance into a new plane of existence to which our vital\nnature has not been completely adapted nor our mind thoroughly accustomed.\nFrom a narrow perfection of animality man has arrived in the imperfectness of\nspiritual life, where the civil war between the forces of our primitive past\nand those belonging to our future has [robbed](errata.htm#1) us of peace. Not\nhaving reached its normal stage humanity is enveloped in the incandescent\nvapour of suffering.\n\np. 68\n\nMAN\'S greatness is like the morning sun, its horizon is far before us. Man\ntruly lives in the life that is beyond him; he toils for the unknown master,\nhe stores for the unborn, he leaves the best harvest of his life for reapers\nwho have not yet come; the time which is yet to be is truer to him than the\ntime which is. Man offers himself as a sacrifice for all that lies in future;\nthe motive power which guides the course of his growth is expectation. All\nthis shows that man is not yet born, his history is the history of birth-\nthroes. Our greatest men bring in their life the message of man\'s future\nbirth; for they dwell in the time to come, making it ready for ourselves. They\nreveal to us a life whose glory is not in the absence of suffering, but in the\nfact that its sufferings have been made creative, transmuted into the stuff of\nlife itself. It is like the tree which garners the sun\'s heat and light in its\nfibre and breaks out in beauty of fruitfulness. By extinguishing the fire of\npain man may find his comfort, his period of slumber, which is the period of\nstagnant time, an imprisoned present; but by mastering this fire he lights his\nlamp of wisdom which gives illumination to the endless future.\n\np. 69\n\nTHERE are sufferings about which the question comes to our mind whether we\ndeserve them. We must frankly acknowledge that explanations are not offered to\nus. So it does not help us in the least to complain, let us rather be worthy\nof the challenge thrown to us by them. That we have been wounded is a fact\nwhich can be ignored, but that we have been brave is a truth of the highest\nimportance. For the former belongs to the outer world of cause and effect,\nwhile the latter belongs to the world of spirit.\n\np. 70\n\nWE must know that to be provided with an exact apportionment of what we\ndeserve and need, is like travelling in a world whose flatness is ideally\nperfect, and therefore where the fluid forces of nature are held in suspense.\nWe require ups and downs, however unpleasant they may be, in our life\'s\ngeography, in order to make our thoughts and energies fluently active. Our\nlife\'s journey is a journey in an unknown country, where hills and hollows\ncome in our way unawares, keeping our minds ever active in dealing with them.\nThey do not come according to our deserts, but our deserts are judged\naccording to our treatment of them.\n\np. 71\n\nWHEN the ship\'s hold is full of water then only does the buffeting of the\noutside waters become a menace. The inside water is not so visibly\nthreatening, its tumult not so stupendously apparent,--it destroys with its\ndead weight. So the temptation is strong to cast all the blame on the waves\noutside. But if good sense does not dawn in time, of all hands manning the\npumps, then sinking is inevitable. However hopeless the task of getting rid of\nthe internal water may now and then appear, it is surely more hopeful than\ntrying to bale away the water of the outside seas!\n\nObstacles and opposition from without there always will be, but they become\ndangers only when there are also obstacles and opposition within.\n\np. 72\n\nWHEN we come to believe that we are in possession of our God because we belong\nto some particular sect it gives us such a complete sense of comfort, that God\nis needed no longer except for quarrelling with others whose idea of God\ndiffers from ours in theoretical details.\n\nHaving been able to make provision for our God in some shadow-land of creed we\nfeel free to reserve all the space for ourselves in the world of reality,\nridding it of the wonder of the infinite, making it as trivial as our own\nhousehold furniture. Such unlimited vulgarity only becomes possible when we\nhave no doubt in our minds that we believe in God while our life ignores Him.\n\np. 73\n\nTHE pious man of sect is proud because he is confident of his right of\npossession in God. The man of devotion is meek because he is conscious of\nGod\'s right of love over his life and soul. The object of our possession\nbecomes smaller than ourselves, and without acknowledging it in so many words\nthe bigoted sectarian has an implicit belief that God can be kept secured for\ncertain individuals in a cage which is of their own make. In a similar manner\nthe primitive races of men believe that their ceremonials have a magic\ninfluence upon their deities. Sectarianism is a perverse form of worldliness\nin the disguise of religion; it breeds a narrowness of heart in a greater\nmeasure than the cult of the world based upon material interest can ever do.\nFor undisguised pursuit of self has its safety in its openness, like filth\nexposed to the sun and air. But the self-magnification with its consequent\nlessening of God that goes on unchecked under the cover of sectarianism loses\nits chance of salvation because it defiles the very source of purity.\n\np. 74\n\nRELIGION, like poetry, is not a mere idea, it is expression. The self-\nexpression of God is in the endless variedness of creation; and our attitude\ntowards the Infinite Being must also in its expression have a variedness of\nindividuality ceaseless and unending. Those sects which jealously build their\nboundaries with too rigid creeds excluding all spontaneous movement of the\nliving spirit may keep hoarded their theology but they kill religion.\n\np. 75\n\nTHE attempt to make the one religion which is their own prevail for all time\nand space, comes naturally to men addicted to sectarianism. This makes it\noffensive to them to be told that God is generous in his distribution of love,\nand his means of communication with men have not been restricted to a blind\nlane abruptly stopping at one historical point of time and place. If humanity\never happens to be overwhelmed with a catastrophe of a universal flood of one\nreligion then God will have to make provision for another Noah\'s Ark to save\nhis creatures from a spiritual destruction.\n\np. 76\n\nWHEN religion is in the complete possession of the sect and is made smooth to\nthe level of the monotonous average, it becomes correct and comfortable, but\nloses the living spirit of art. For art is the expression of the universal\nthrough the individual, and religion in its outer aspect is the art of the\nhuman soul. It almost becomes a matter of pride and a sign of superior culture\nto be able to outrage all codes of decency imposed by an authorised religion\nbearing the stamp of approval of an organisation which can persecute but has\nnot the power to persuade.\n\nAs an analogous phenomenon, we have known literary men deliberately\ncultivating a dread of whatever has the reputation of goodness, and also men\nof art afraid of being suspected as a lover of the beautiful. They rebel\nagainst the fact that what is proper and what is true in beauty and in\ngoodness have become mixed up in men\'s mind. The appraisement of what is\nproper does not require any degree of culture or natural sensitiveness of\nmind, and therefore it fetches a ready price in the market, outbids truth,\nbecomes petty in its tyranny and leaves p. 77 smudges of vulgarity upon things\nthat are precious. To rescue truth from the dungeon of propriety has ever been\nthe mission, of poets and artists, but in the time of revolution they are apt\nto go further by rejecting truth itself.\n\nIn our epic R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana we find that when Prince R\xc4\x81machandra won back his wife\nfrom the clutches of the giant who had abducted her, his people clamoured for\nher rejection, suspecting defilement. Similarly in art fastidious men of\nculture are clamouring for the banishment of the beautiful because she has\nbeen allowed to remain so long in the possession of propriety.\n\np. 78\n\nTHOSE who have their enterprises in the world of nature, master her forces,\nbecoming rich in wealth and power. The greatest gain which comes across their\npath in their adventures is moral truth. For power is combination, and all\ncombinations, in order to be perfect, need the help of the moral law, in which\nindividuals acknowledge the universal principle of the good. Moral truth is\nmost needed when men move, and move together.\n\nBut laws, whether in nature where it is physical, or in society where it is\nmoral, are external. They are formal, lacking that deeper mystery of\nperfectness, which is creation; which is in the beauty of harmony in nature;\nwhich is in the beauty of love in man. Law is the channel of finitude through\nwhich things evolve without ceasing, but its meaning lies in its revolution\nround an inner centre which is infinite. We follow law to live; we reach the\ncentre to find immortality.\n\np. 79\n\nFOLLOWING the interminable current of law, exploring the countless fields of\nforces and openings of wealth, we talk of endless endeavour but of no ultimate\ngain. We know that power thrives in moving. When it stumble against some final\nobject it receives its death fall. We of all peoples in the world know to our\ncost that when nations grow weary of their quest, settling down to store up\nand to arrange their possessions; when with their distrust of new ideas their\nmorals stiffen into conventions, becoming unfit to guide them in the path of\nlife\'s adventures, keeping them bound to growthless traditions, then they are\ngradually pushed away from life\'s high road by the moving forces of history.\n\nBut this endlessness of movement in the outer world only proves that there we\nhave no goal to reach and our goal is somewhere else. It is in the inner\nregion of spirit. There our deepest longing is for that peace which rests upon\nfulfilment. There we meet our God. He is the ever-moving power in the world.\nHe is the ever-reposing love in the soul. God eludes us in p. 80 nature to\ncall us onward; in the soul He surrenders Himself to gather us to His heart.\nThis is why, in the realm of power, we grow by aggrandisement; but, in the\nrealm of love we grow by renunciation. This is why though in our\n[worldly](errata.htm#2) ambition pride acts as an incentive, it is the\ngreatest of all obstacles in our spiritual aspiration.\n\np. 81\n\nIN a lyrical poem, the metre and the idea are blended in one. Treated\nseparately, they reveal themselves as two contrary forces; and instances are\ncommon in which their natural antagonism has not been overcome, thus resulting\nin the production of bad poems.\n\nWe are the artists, before whom lie materials which are mutually obstructive.\nThey continually clash, until they develop into a creation perfect in unity.\nVery often, in order to shirk trouble and secure peace, we sacrifice one of\nthe contending parties. This makes the fight impossible, but also the\ncreation. The restless spirit of nature divorced from the soul\'s repose drives\nus to the madness of work which piles up towers of things. On the other hand\nthe spiritual being deprived of its world of reality lives only in the exile\nof abstraction, creating phantoms in which exaggerations, unchecked by the\nstrict necessities of forms, run riot.\n\np. 82\n\nWHEN the man-made world is less an expression of man\'s creative soul than a\nmechanical device for some purposes of power, then it hardens and narrows\nitself, attains too definite a character, leading to proficiency at the cost\nof the immense suggestiveness of life. In his creative activities man\nestablishes human relationships with his surroundings, making nature instinct\nwith his own life and love. But with his utilitarian energies he fights\nnature, banishes her from his world, deforms and defiles her with the ugliness\nof his callous ambitions. This world of man\'s own manufacture with its\ndiscordant shrieks and mechanical movements incessantly suggests to him and\nconvinces him of a scheme of universe which is an abstract system and which\nhas no touch of the person and therefore no ultimate reality.\n\np. 83\n\nWITH the truth of our expression we grow in truth. The truth of art is in the\ndisinterested joy of creation, which is fatally injured when betrayed into a\npurpose alien to itself. All the great civilisations that have become extinct\nmust have come to their end through some constant wrong expression of\nhumanity; through slavery imposed upon fellow-beings; through parasitism on a\ngigantic scale bred by wealth, by man\'s clinging reliance on material\nresources; through a scoffing spirit of scepticism robbing us of our means of\nsustenance in the path of truth.\n\np. 84\n\nCONSCIOUSNESS is the light by the help v of which we travel along our path of\nlife. But we cannot afford to squander this light at every step. Economy we\nneed, and habit is that economy. It enables us to live and think without fully\nkeeping our mind illumined. On festival nights we do not count the cost of our\nexcess of light, because it is not for removing some deficiency, but for\nexpressing the sense of our inner exuberance. And for the same reason habit\nbecomes a sign of poverty in our spiritual life; for it is not a life of\nnecessity, but of expression. In our love, our consciousness has to remain at\nits brightest, in order to be true. For love is no mere carrying out of some\npurpose, it is the full illumination of consciousness itself.\n\np. 85\n\nIF we allow our act of worship to deaden into a habit, then it frustrates\nitself, stiffening into mere piety which is a calculated economy of love. For\nworship has its worth, not in the action, but in a perfect outflow of\nconsciousness in which habit has the tendency of becoming an impediment. We\ngrow worldly in our devotion when we imagine that it confers upon us some\nspecial advantage, thus causing pious habits to be formed and valued. For when\nit is a question of profit, buying in the cheapest market is the best wisdom;\nbut when complete giving out is the sole object, then economy is cheating\none\'s own self.\n\np. 86\n\nTHERE is one thing which is common in the process of the physical and the\nspiritual life. In both it is essential that we must forget the self. We know\nall the better what is around us by not having to remember our own selves at\nevery step. When we are more to ourselves, then the world is less to us. But\nforgetfulness of self in our ordinary life of usefulness is mostly negative,\nit is attained by habit. Not so in the spiritual life, where self is forgotten\nbecause love is there. It is like the individual word, losing its meaning\nwhere it is separate, but regaining itself all the more where it is one with\nthe whole poem. In the spiritual life we forget our exclusive individual\npurpose and are flooded with the spirit of perfection which through us\ntranscends ourselves. In this we feel our immortality, which is the great\nmeaning of our life.\n\np. 87\n\nOUR nature being complex, it is unsafe to generalise about things that are\nhuman; and it is an incomplete statement of truth to say that habits have the\nsole effect of deadening our mind. The habits that are helpful are like a\nchannel, which helps the current to flow. It is open where the water runs\nonward, guarding it only where it has the danger of deviation. The bee\'s life\nin its channel of habit has no opening,--it revolves within a narrow circle of\nperfection. Man\'s life has its institutions which are its organised habits.\nWhen these act as enclosures, then the result may be perfect, like a beehive\nof wonderful precision of form, but unsuitable for the mind which has\nunlimited possibilities of growth.\n\np. 88\n\nFOR the current of our spiritual life creeds and rituals are channels that may\nthwart or help according to their fixity or openness. When a symbol of\nspiritual idea becomes rigidly elaborate in its construction, it supplants the\nidea which it should support. In art and literature metaphors which are the\nsymbol of our emotional [perceptions](errata.htm#3) excite our imagination but\ndo not arrest it. For they never claim a monopoly of our attention; they leave\nopen the way for the endless possibility of other metaphors. They lose their\nartistic value if they degenerate into fixed habits of expression. Shelley, in\nhis poem of the Skylark, pours out images which we value because they are only\na few suggestions of the immeasurableness of our enjoyment. But if, because of\ntheir fitness and beauty, a law were passed that while thinking about a\nskylark these images should be treated as final and no others admitted, then\nShelley\'s poem would at once become, false; for its truth is in its fluidity,\nin its modesty, which tacitly admits that it has not the last word.\n\np. 89\n\nTHE other great body of ours is the world, with which this little body of ours\never aspires to establish a perfect relation of harmony. Is it simply for the\nsake of some convenience? Do our eyes try to see lest some danger or obstacle\nshould come unawares in the dark, lest we might fail to find the things that\nare needful? No doubt these are powerful incentives, but the great fact lies\nin the delight of the meeting of our eyes with the world of lines, colours and\nmovements. There is an incessant call from this universe of light, of sound,\nof touch, to our eyes, ears, to our limbs, and the response to it is a\nfulfilment which not only belongs to us, but to the great world. And this is\nthe reason why from remote ages light incessantly knocked at the closed gates\nof life\'s blindness, till after repeated efforts life opened its windows of\nsight, and the union of the two was perfected. This was a wedding whose\nhighest meaning is in its joy.\n\np. 90\n\nWE have a mental body, which has its organs of thought and feeling. There is\nthe great social mind of man with which it seeks its harmony, for the\nperfecting of which experiments are carried on without rest. This aspiration\nalso has not its source in expediency. It is an impulse for union which drives\nour mind across our little home and neighbourhood to its love tryst abroad. It\nmust unite with the great mind of humanity to find its fulfilment. The beehive\nis the product of the truth of the unity in the bee\'s life; but literature,\nart and politics, moral laws and religions, which have no end to their freedom\nof growth, are born of the wedding of the man with Man.\n\np. 91\n\nTHE question is asked, if life\'s journey be endless where is its goal? The\nanswer is, it is everywhere. We are in a palace which has no end, but which we\nhave reached. By exploring it and extending our relationship with it we are\never making it more and more our own. The infant is born in the same universe\nwhere lives the adult of ripe mind. But its position is not like a schoolboy\nwho has yet to learn his alphabet, finding himself in a college class. The\ninfant has its own joy of life because the world is not a mere road, but a\nhome, of which it will have more and more as it grows up in wisdom. With our\nroad the gain is at the end, but with this world of ours the gain is at every\nstep; for it is the road and the home in one; it leads us on yet gives us\nshelter.\n\np. 92\n\nOUR life in the world is like listening to a song, to enjoy which we do not\nwait till it is finished. The song is there, in the singing from the very\nfirst note. Its unity permeates all its parts and therefore we do not\nimpatiently seek the end, but follow the development. In the same way, because\nthe world is truly one its parts do not tire us--only, our joy grows in depth\nwith our deeper comprehension of its unity. At the moment when our various\nenergies are employed with the varied in the world of nature and of man, the\nOne in us is growing up towards the One in all. If the many and the one, the\nendless movement and the eternal reaching of the goal, were not in harmony in\nour being, our existence would be to us like ever learning grammar, and yet\nnever coming to know any language.\n\np. 93\n\nNATURE is a mistress who tempts us with liberal wages--so much so, that we\nwork extra hours for the extra remuneration. Yet in the midst of this bribery\nand these temptations man still cries for deliverance. For he knows that he is\nnot a born slave and he refuses to be deluded into believing that to follow\none\'s own desires unhindered is freedom. His real trust lies in his growth and\nnot in his accumulations. The consciousness of a great inner truth lifts man\nfrom his surroundings of petty moments into the region of the eternal. It is\nthe sense of something positive in himself for which he renounces his wealth,\nreputation, and life itself, and throws aside the scholar\'s book of logic,\nbecoming simple as a child in his wisdom.\n\np. 94\n\nIN fact, man wants to reach that inner region where he can take his stand in\nthe perfection of his unity, and not there where link upon link is forged, in\nan endless series, in the chain of things and events.\n\nBut as our body seeks its harmony with the great world-body for its\nfulfilment, so the one in us seeks its union with the great One. The One in us\nknows itself, has its delight in itself and expresses itself in its\nactivities. It is truth and joy and expression. Therefore its union with the\nhighest One must be in wisdom, in love and in service. This is our religion,\nthat is to say, our higher nature. Its purposes cannot be definitely pointed\nout and explained, for it belongs to that life in the spiritual world where\nour objects have their recognition in something which we vaguely try to\ndescribe as blessedness,--a state of perfection, which is an end in itself. It\nis easy for man to ignore it and yet live, but man never did ignore it. He\ndoubts it, mocks it, and strikes it, he fails in his realisation of it, but\neven in his failures and rebellions, in his desperate attempts to escape from\nit, he revolves round this one great truth.\n\np. 95\n\nA BLOCK of stone is unplastic, insensitive, inert, it offers resistance to the\ncreative idea of the artist. But for a sculptor its very obstacles are an\nadvantage and he carves his image out of it. Our physical existence is an\nobstacle to our spirit, it has every aspect of a bondage, and to all\nappearance it is a perpetual humiliation to our soul. And therefore it is the\nbest material for our soul to manifest herself through it, to proclaim her\nfreedom by fashioning her ornaments out of her fetters. The limitations of our\nouter circumstances are only to give opportunities to our soul, and by being\nable to defy them she realises her truth.\n\np. 96\n\nOUR living body in its relations to the physical world has its various wishes.\nThese are to eat, to sleep, to keep warm or cool, as necessity demands--and\nmany others. But it has one permanent wish, which is deeper and there-fore\nhidden. It is the wish for health. It works every moment fighting diseases and\nmaking constant adjustments with changing circumstances. The greater\nproportion of its activities are carried on behind our consciousness. He who\nhas wisdom in regard to his physical welfare knows this and tries to establish\nharmony between the bodily desires that are conscious and this one desire\nwhich is latent. And he willingly sacrifices the claims of his appetites to\nthe higher claim of his health.\n\nWe have our social body in which we come into relation with other men. Its\nobvious wishes are those that are connected with our selfish impulses. We want\nto get more than others and pay less than is our due. But there is another\nwish, deeply inherent in our social life, which is concerned with the welfare\nof the community. He who has social wisdom knows p. 97 this and tries to bring\nall his clamorous wishes about personal pleasure, comfort and freedom under\nthe dominion of this hidden wish for the good of others.\n\nLikewise the obvious wish of our soul is to realise the distinction of its\nindividuality, but it has its inherent wish to surrender itself in love to the\nGreat Soul.\n\nThe wish for health takes into account the future of the body. The wish for\nthe social good also has its outlook upon the time to come. They face the\ninfinite. The wish of our soul to be one in love with the Great Soul\ntranscends all limitations of time and space. Thus in our body, society, and\nsoul we find on the surface the activity of numerous wishes and in their depth\nthat of the one will which gives these wishes unity, leading them to peace,\ngoodness, and love. In other words, on the one hand we have the wishes of the\nmoment, and on the other the wish for the eternal. It is the function of our\nsoul to unite these two and build its heaven upon the foundation of the earth.\n\np. 98\n\nA YOUNG friend of mine comes to me this morning to inform me that it is his\nbirth-day and that he has just reached his nineteenth year. The distance\nbetween my age and his is great, and yet when I look at him it is not the\nincompleteness of his life which strikes me, but something which is complete\nin his youth. And in this differs the thing which grows, from the thing which\nis being made. A building in its unfinished stage is only too evidently\nunfinished. But in life\'s growth every stage has its perfection, the flower as\nwell as the fruit.\n\np. 99\n\nWHEN I was a child, God also became a child with me to be my playmate.\nOtherwise my imperfections would have weighed me down, and every moment it\nwould have been a misery to be and yet not fully to be. The things that kept\nme occupied were trifling and the things I played with were made of dust and\nsticks. But nevertheless my occupations were made precious to me and the\nimportance that was given to my toys made them of equal value with the\nplaythings of the adult. The majesty of childhood won for me the world\'s\nhomage, because there was revealed the infinite in its aspect of the small.\n\nAnd the reason is the same, which gives the youth the right to claim his full\ndue and not to be despised. The divinity which is ever young, has crowned him\nwith his own wreath, whispering to his ears that he is the rightful inheritor\nof all the world\'s wealth.\n\nThe infinite is with us in the beauty of our childhood, in the strength of our\nyouth, in the wisdom of our age; in play, in earning, and in spending.\n\np. 100\n\nTHE beauty which is in this evening sky comprehends forces tremendous in their\nawfulness. Yet it reveals to us the harmony which must be in the centre of all\nworld activities, the harmony which has a still voice which is music itself.\nBecause we are able to take view of this evening world where the distant and\nthe near are brought face to face, we can see what is positively true in it--\nits beauty and unfathomable peace. When, through death, the deathlessness of\nsome great life is discovered, the same vision of peace is revealed to us. The\nprofound soul of Buddha is brought before our minds like this evening sky, and\nthrough all his struggles and sorrows, through his compassionate toil for men,\nwe see a perfect assurance and repose of strength which is beauty. In smaller\nmen the field of life is too narrow and therefore contra-dictions are too\nexaggerated to permit us any complete view of truth. But we may be sure, that\nin the currents of their lives as they run beyond death these contradictions\nare harmonised, for truth is over all, and beauty is the expression of truth.\n\np. 101\n\nIN the Upanishad God is described as "The Peaceful, the Good, the One." His\npeace is the peace of truth which we clearly see in Nature. The earth moves\nand the stars, every cell is moving and working in this tree, every blade of\ngrass in this field is busy, and every atom of this evening star is restless,\nbut peace is in the heart of all this movement--this movement which is\ncreative. The movement which lacks this inner peace destroys. God, as the\nPeaceful, is revealed to him who has attained truth in his life, the truth\nwhich is ever active and yet which has an immensity of repose born of the\nmastery of self. It is not the loss of energy, the waning of life, which is\npeace, but their perfection.\n\nAn ignorant man finding himself in a factory for the first time in his life,\nis frightened at the bewildering medley of movements, but he who knows it is\nstruck with admiration at the concentration of purpose dwelling in its centre,\nunmoved. This takes away all misgivings, and the perfect correlation of\nactivities appears as beautiful. This is the peace which belongs to truth.\n\np. 102\n\nLIFE is a flow of harmony that united the in and the out, the end and the\nmeans, the what is and the what is to come. Life does not store up but\nassimilates, does not construct but creates, its work and itself are never\ndissociated. When the materials of our surroundings are not living, when they\nare fixed habits and hoarded possessions then our life and our world become\nseparated and their mutual discord ends in the destruction of both. Or when\nsome unbalanced excess of passion takes predominance in the buildings of our\nown world its distribution of weight goes wrong, and it constantly oppresses\nthe wholeness of our life. The source of all the great evils in society, in\ngovernment, in other organisations is in the alienation of the living being\nfrom its outer habitation. The gulf thus created by the receding stream of\nsoul we try to replenish with a continuous pour of wealth which may have the\npower to fill but not the power to unite. Therefore the gap is dangerously\nconcealed under glittering quicksands of things which by their own\naccumulating weight cause a sudden subsidence in the middle of our sleep of\nsecurity.\n\np. 103\n\nTHE world of senses in which animals live is limited. Our reason has opened\nthe gate for our mind into the heart of the infinite. Yet this freedom of\nreason is but a freedom in the outer courtyard of existence. Objects of\nknowledge maintain an infinite distance from us who are the knowers. For\nknowledge is not union. Therefore the further world of freedom awaits us there\nwhere we reach truth, not through feeling it by senses or knowing it by\nreason, but through union of perfect sympathy. This is an emancipation\ndifficult fully to imagine; we have but glimpses of its character. We perceive\nthe fact of a picture by seeing it, we know about it by measuring its lines,\nanalysing its colours and studying the laws of harmony in its composition. But\neven then it is no realisation of the picture, for which we want an intimate\nunion with it immediate to ourselves.\n\np. 104\n\nTHE picture of a flower in a botanical book is an information; its mission\nends with our knowledge. But in pure art it is a personal communication. And\ntherefore until it finds its harmony in the depth of our personality it misses\nits mark. We can treat existence solely as a text-book furnishing us lessons\nand we shall not be disappointed. But we know that there its mission does not\nend. For in our joy in it which is an end in itself we feel that it is a\ncommunication, the final response to which is not the response of our knowing\nbut the response of our being.\n\np. 105\n\nWHEN Buddha preached _Maitri_ \\--the relationship of harmony--not only with\nhuman beings but with all creation, did he not have this truth in his mind\nthat our treatment of the world is wrong when we solely treat it as a fact\nwhich can be known and used? Did he not feel that its meaning can be attained\nonly through love because it is an expression of love which waits for its\nanswer from our soul emancipated from the bondage of self? This emancipation\ncannot be negative in character, for love can never lead to negation. The\nperfect freedom is in a perfect harmony of relationship and not in a mere\nseverance of bondage. Freedom has no content, and therefore no meaning, where\nit has nothing but itself. Soul\'s emancipation is in the fulfilment of its\nrelation to the central truth of everything that there is, which is impossible\nto define because it is in the end of all definitions.\n\np. 106\n\nNO flame burns for ever. Light goes out for want of oil, is puffed out by the\nwind, often the lamp itself is shattered. In our fit of irritation we may say\nthat the power of darkness is final and true, or that we create light\nourselves by lighting the lamp. But the truth is that every extinction of\nlight is to prove that the source of light is without end, and man\'s true\npower lies only in his ability to prove this over and over again.\n\np. 107\n\nI BELIEVE that there is an ideal hovering over and permeating the earth,--an\nideal of that Paradise which is not the mere outcome of fancy, but the\nultimate reality in which all things are and towards which all things are\nmoving. I believe that this vision of Paradise is to be seen in the sunlight,\nand the green of the earth, in the flowing streams, in the gladness of\nspringtime, the repose of a winter morning, in the beauty of human face and\nwealth of human love. Everywhere in this earth the spirit of Paradise is awake\nand sending forth its voice. It reaches our inner ears without our knowing it.\nIt tunes our harp of life, urging us to send our aspiration beyond the finite,\nas flowers send their perfume into the air and birds their songs.\n\np. 108\n\nOUR energies are employed in supplying ourselves with things and pleasures.\nThey have no eternity in their background. There-fore we try to give things an\nappearance of permanence by making them big. Man in his anxiety to prolong his\npleasure and power tries to make additions, and we are afraid to stop, because\nwe fear that they must some day come to an end.\n\nBut truth is not afraid to be small, to come to an end,--just as a poem, when\nit is finished, is not really dead. Not because a poem is composed of endless\nlines but because it carries an ideal of perfection. The pauses of truth has\nthe cadence of the infinite, its disappearances are the processional arches on\nits path of immortality.\n\np. 109\n\nWE light the lamp in our room which creates a seeming opposition between it\nand the great outside world. Our life on the earth is like that small room in\nwhich our consciousness has been concentrated. And we imagine that outside it\nlies death which opposes it. But the one indivisible truth of existence which\nis for us must not be doubted because our life obscures it for a moment.\n\np. 110\n\nTHE vision of life which we see in the world is a vision of joy. The joy is in\nits ever flowing colour, music and dance. If there were truth in death this\nspirit of joy would vanish from the heart of existence. The lamp we light in\nthe night has a wick which is small and oil which is very little. But there is\nno timidness in its tiny flame burning as it is in the heart of an immense\ndarkness; for the truth of the light which sustains it is infinite.\n\np. 111\n\nTHE world, like a stream of sounds in music, is a perpetual flow of forces and\nforms, and therefore from the outside it has an aspect of impermanence. There\nit represents death, being a continual current of losses. But the loss is only\nfor the channel, the instrument through which music is made to pass. It is the\nunity of melody which ever survives the fleeting notes. If individual notes\ncould claim a pro-longed endlessness then they would miss their true eternity\nwhich is the music. The desert has the quality of the immutable because it\nlacks life. In a soil which is fruitful, life reveals its immortality by its\nceaseless passage through death.\n\np. 112\n\nIT is given to us to reveal our soul, that which is One in us, which is\neternal. This can only be done by its passage through the fleeting Many; to\nassert the infinity of the spirit by continual sacrifice of forms. The self\nbeing the vessel that gathers and holds gives us the opportunity of giving up.\nIf we believe only in self then we anxiously cling to our stores which causes\nus misery and failure. When we believe in soul the very inconstancy of life\nfinds its eternal meaning and we feel that we can afford to lose.\n\n\n\nPrinted in the United States of America\n\n\n\n'
