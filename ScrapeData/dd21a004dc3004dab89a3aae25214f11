Whilst beholding the countenance of Krishnu,\nBasoodeo and Dewukee became possessed of knowledge, and had a firm belief in\ntheir minds, "That both brothers were deities; and that they had descended\nupon the earth to destroy evil spirits, and remove the burthens of the world."\nWhilst these thoughts were passing in the minds of Basoodeo and Dewukee, Huri,\nacquainted with the secrets of the heart, sent forth his delusive power, which\ndeprived them both of understanding; and they looked upon them both again as\ntheir children. In the mean while, Shree Krishnu Chund said, with very great\nhumility, "You have for a long time past suffered great afflictions, and have\nretained a constant recollection of us both. It has not been any fault of\nours, because since you placed us under charge of Nund, at Gokool, we have\nbeen under the authority of others, and have had no power of our own. But this\nthought was constantly in our minds, that we had not contributed in any\n\np. 161\n\nway to the happiness of her, who had borne us in her womb; and had not enjoyed\nthe delightful society of our parents, and had wasted our lives to no purpose\nin the house of strangers. They have suffered great misfortunes on our\naccount, and we have not done them any service. In the world they are\npossessed of power, who serve their fathers and mothers. We have remained\nindebted to them, and have not been able to do any kind offices for them."\n\nO lord of the earth! when Shree Krishnu Jee had thus given expression to his\nmental grief, Basoodeo and Dewukee embraced the two brothers with the greatest\naffection, and forgot all their former affliction in their present joy. Having\nthus made their parents happy, the two brothers went thence to Oogursen, and\njoining their hands said, "Grandfather! be pleased to assume the regal power:\nthis is a favourable constellation and a propitious day for doing so."\n\nWhen the Raja Oogursen had heard these words of Huri, he rose up, and having\ncome and thrown himself at the feet of Shree Krishnu Chund, began to say, "O\nlord of compassion! be pleased to listen to my humble petition; that, as you\nhave destroyed the great sinner, Kuns, and all evil spirits, and thereby\nconferred happiness on your worshippers, you should yourself ascend the throne\nand rule over Muttra, and grant protection to your subjects."\n\nKrishnu replied,--"O great king! the members of the family of Judoo have not\nany right of inheritance to the kingly power, a circumstance which is\nuniversally known. When the Raja Jujat was in his old age, he called his son\nJudoo, and said to him, \'Give me your youth, and take my old age.\' On hearing\nthis, Judoo thought to himself, \'If I give my father my present youth, he,\nbeing young again, will have sexual connexion, the sin of which will fall on\nme: wherefore, it is better I should not do so.\' Having thus reflected and\nconsidered, he said to his father, \'I cannot comply with your request.\' On\nhearing these words, the Raja Jujat was\n\np. 162\n\nangry and pronounced a curse upon Judoo, saying, \'Begone! none of your\ndescendants shall ever have regal power.\' In the mean while, his younger son,\nnamed Poor, presented himself, and joining his hands said, \'Father! give me\nyour old age, and accept my youth; this body is useless to me: if any\nadvantage can accrue to you from it, what can be better?\' When Poor had thus\nspoken, the Raja Jujat was highly pleased, and exchanged with him his old age\nfor Poor\'s youth, and said, \'The succession to the throne shall continue in\nyour family.\' For this reason, grandfather! as I am a descendant of Judoo, it\nis not right for me to exercise sovereign power. Do you ascend the throne, and\nassume royal authority and banish all solicitude. We will accomplish, whatever\nyou may order us to perform. We will inflict severe punishment on all, who do\nnot obey your commands. And be not troubled with care and anxiety, but carry\non a just and equitable government, and promote the welfare of your subjects.\nCause search to be made for all members of the family of Judoo, who, from\ndread of Kuns, have abandoned their own cities to dwell under the authority of\nstrangers, and grant them a happy settlement in Muttra. Worship brahmins, cows\nand the gods, and constantly give your attention to their protection and\nsupport."\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said, O incarnation of\njustice! Shree Krishnu Chund, the king of kings and the benefactor of his\nworshippers, knowing Oogursen to be one who offered devotion to him, having\nthus advised and seated him on the throne, made the marks of sovereignty on\nhis forehead; and having raised the royal canopy over his head, both the\nbrothers began to fan him.\n\nAll the inhabitants of the city were highly delighted, and began to shout\nforth exclamations of joyful praise, and the gods to rain flowers. O great\nking! having thus seated Oogursen upon the throne, the brothers brought away\nwith them many rich dresses and jewels, and went thence to\n\np. 163\n\n[paragraph continues] Nund Rae Jee, in whose presence they stood with joined\nhands, and said with the greatest humility, "How shall we speak in fitting\nterms of your greatness? If we had a thousand tongues, we could not explain\nyour many excellent qualities. You have brought us up with the greatest\naffection as your own sons, and shown us the most tender kindness; and our\nmother, Jusodha, loves us greatly, fixes her kindest regards upon us, and\nalways treats us as her own children; she never allows her mind to be\nestranged from us." Shree Krishnu added, "Father! you must not be offended at\nmy words, I will speak to you with sincerity, and will call you both my\nparents; but shall now remain for some days at Muttra, and having visited my\nbrethren of the same caste, hear the history of the family of Judoo, and will\ngladden my mother and father with a meeting, for they have suffered great\ngriefs on our account, if they had not had us conveyed to your house, they\nwould not have endured any troubles." With these words Krishnu placed the\ndresses and jewels before Nund, and, abandoning all affection, said, "Offer my\nrespects to my mother by kissing her feet, and continue to love me with\naffection."\n\nOn these words coming from Shree Krishnu\'s mouth, Nund Rae was very sad, and\nbegan to heave deep sighs; and the cowherds\' children said to themselves,\nreflecting on what Krishnu had said, "This is a very strange speech he has\nmade, we are inclined to infer from it, that he is about to deceive us, and go\naway, otherwise he would not have spoken so unkindly."\n\nO great king! after a short time, one of their companions, named Soodamu,\nsaid, "Brother Krishnu! what business have you now at Muttra, that you thus\nunfeelingly abandon your father? You have done well in destroying Kuns, and\ncompleting the work you came to accomplish. Unite now with Nund, and come and\nrule over Brindabun; be not eagerly desirous to reign here, you will not be so\nhappy as\n\np. 164\n\nat Brindabun. Fools, on obtaining sovereign power, forget themselves, and are\ndelighted at beholding elephants and horses. Do not quit Brindabun to dwell\nelsewhere. Spring is perpetual there; the beauty of the thick woods and of the\nJumna is never effaced from the mind. Brother! if you are determined on taking\nup your abode at Muttra, resigning the pleasures of Brindabun, not attending\nto my suggestion, and abandoning all affection for your parents, what\naccession to your greatness will you acquire by doing so. You will attend upon\nOogursen, and suffer anxiety night and day. You must be subservient to him, on\nwhom you have conferred the government. How will you submit to this disgrace?\nIt is, therefore, most advisable that you should not cause grief to Nund Rae,\nbut continue to remain with him. Think of the forests, the rivers and sports\nof Bruj. Forget not the herds! We will not let you go alone, O lord of Bruj!\nbut will all accompany you."\n\nHaving proceeded thus far in his recitation, Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said to\nthe Raja Pureechit,--O great king! when they had made many speeches to the\nabove effect, ten or twenty of their companions remained with Shree Krishnu\nand Bulram; and they suggested to Nund Rae to go on, without any anxiety, with\nall others, and that they would come afterwards with Krishnu and Bulram. On\nhearing these words, the cowherds were in great agitation, as though they had\nbeen bitten by snakes; gazing on the face of Krishnu, and losing all\nresolution, they stood like pictures.\n\nBuldeo Jee, perceiving that Nund Rae was deeply grieved, said to him, "Father!\nwhy are you so sad? We will return in a few days, after having accomplished\nwhat we have to do here. We send you on in advance of us, because our mother\nmust be much disquieted by being left alone; she will, in a measure, be\nrestored to confidence by your going." Nund Jee replied, "Son! come once with\nus, and return after the interview."\n\np. 165\n\nHaving thus spoken, Nund was greatly disquieted and continued embracing his\nfeet. The splendour of his understanding abated and became dull; he could not\nshed tears. O great king! when Shree Krishnu Chund Jee saw, that Nund and the\ncowherds\' children were greatly troubled in mind, without being under the\npower of delusion, he thought to himself, that they would not live, if\nseparated from him. He then sent forth that particular delusive power\nbelonging to him, which has deluded the whole world. This power deprived Nund\nand the cowherds of all understanding. Krishnu then said, "Father! why do you\nindulge in such regrets? Consider what a short distance there is between\nMuttra and Brindabun. We are not going far from you, that you should be so\nsad. The people of Brindabun must be in grief, and, therefore, we send you\nbefore us."\n\nWhen Krishnu had thus explained to Nund, his confidence was restored, and\njoining his hands, he said, "Krishnu! if these are your sentiments, I have no\npower to gainsay them. I will depart, as I cannot refuse compliance with your\nexpressed wishes." When Nund Jee had thus spoken, Huri permitted him and the\ncowherds and their children to depart to Brindabun; and the two brothers\nremained at Muttra with some of their companions. The cowherds, who\naccompanied Nund were all during the whole journey, perplexed with heavy\nthoughts, like gamblers, who have lost every thing. Some retained their\nsenses, but others had lost them entirely; they fell down on the road,\ntripping over each other. Although going to Brindabun they continued looking\ntowards Muttra; and were greatly distressed by the pain of separation. In this\nstate, they managed, by some means or other, to arrive at Brindabun. Hearing\nof their arrival, the Ranee Jusodha came running forth in a state of great\nperturbation; and being greatly disquieted in mind, at not seeing Bulram and\nKrishnu, she said to Nund Jee, "Husband! where have you lost our sons, that\nyou have only brought back dresses and jewels?\n\np. 166\n\n[paragraph continues] You have thrown away the gold, and kept the glass. You\nhave foolishly rejected nectar, and taken poison. Like a blind man, obtaining\npossession of the philosopher\'s stone, who throws it away, and afterwards\nstrikes his forehead on hearing of its valuable qualities. You have thrown\naway gems of high value, (meaning Krishnu and Bulram.) You have thus lost our\nsons, and brought dresses and jewels instead of them. What will you do with\nwealth without them? O foolish husband! how can we pass life without them,\nwhose separation from us even for a moment caused us the deepest grief? What\nwas the state of your feelings, when they suggested separation?"\n\nNund Jee was much grieved at these words, and replied, with downcast looks,\n"It is true Krishnu gave me these dresses and jewels; but I know not who\nbrought them here. How shall I mention what Krishnu said to me? You will also\nbe grieved, when you hear his words. He returned to me after having killed\nKuns, and made use of most unkind expressions. They have become the sons of\nBasoodeo; and have gone away from us, after having completely gained our\naffections. When I was astonished at what they said, they talked of\nremuneration to us for bringing them up. Do not call Huri, Nund\'s son; look\nupon and worship him as a deity. I thought, that he was Narayun from the very\nfirst; but being under the power of delusion, regarded him as a son."\n\nO great king! when Nund Rae Jee had repeated truly all Shree Krishnu had said\nto him, Jusodha, being under the influence of delusion, at one time looked\nupon Krishnu as her son, and was sorrowful and disturbed in mind, and shed\ntears. At another time, recovering her reason, she regarded him as a deity;\nand meditating upon him, and celebrating with songs his excellent attributes,\nshe dissipated the grief of her mind. And in this manner all the inhabitants\nof Bruj, both men and women, being deeply imbued with love for Huri, held\nvarious discourses regarding him, which I have not power to describe.\n\np. 167\n\nFor which reason, I will mention the sports of Muttra; listen attentively.\nWhen Huldhur and Gobind came to Basoodeo and Dewukee, after having permitted\nNund Rae to depart, they were delighted at seeing them, and forgot all their\nformer griefs, as a devotee is delighted on obtaining the fruit of the penance\nwhich he has performed. Basoodeo Jee first addressed Dewukee, saying, "Krishnu\nand Buldeo have dwelt amongst strangers, and have ate and drank with them; and\nare not acquainted with the customs of their own caste. It is right,\ntherefore, that we should send for, and consult the family priest, and act by\nhis advice." Dewukee assented. Basoodeo Jee then sent for Gurg, the sage, who\nwas the family priest; and on his arrival, after having explained all the\nperplexities of his mind, enquired, "O great king! kindly inform us, what we\nought to do." Gurg, the sage, replied, "First of all send an invitation to all\ntheir brethen of the same caste; and afterwards admit Bulram and Krishnu to\nthe caste, and present them with Brahminical threads."\n\nWhen the family priest had thus spoken, Basoodeo sent an invitation into the\ncity, and invited all Brahmins, and all descendants of Judoo. They came, and\nwere received with the greatest respect, and offered seats. Basoodeo, first of\nall, having gone through all the ceremonies of initiation into caste, and\ncaused their nativities to be written, presented to the Brahmins ten thousand\ncows with horns of gold, backs of copper, and feet of silver, dressed out in\nsilken cloths, which cows he had made a vow to give at the birth of Krishnu.\nHe afterwards caused festive rejoicings to be made, and having observed all\nthe customs and ordinances of the Vedas, bestowed Brahminical threads on\nBulram and Krishnu; and, having made presents to the two brothers, sent them\nforth to acquire knowledge. They departed and came to the house of a learned\nsage and great pundit, named Sandeepun, of the city of Awuntika, who was then\nresiding at Benares, and possessed of great knowledge; and approaching him\nwith an obeisance, and joined\n\np. 168\n\nhands, they said to him with great humility of manner, "O king of sages! take\ncompassion on us, and with sincerity of mind bestow upon us the gift of\nknowledge." O great king! when Shree Krishnu and Bulram Jee had made this\nhumble address to Sandeepun, the sage, he brought them to his house in the\nmost affectionate manner, and began to instruct them with great kindness. In a\nshort time, having read the four Vedas, and Oopvedas, six Shastrus, nine\ntreatises upon Grammar, eighteen Pooranus, and discourses upon charms,\namulets, enchantments, futurity, astrology, physic, copulation, music and\nprosody, they became the receptacles of the fourteen sciences. After this, the\ntwo brothers said one day to their spiritual preceptor, with joined hands and\ngreat humility, "O great king! it is said, that however much a man may give in\ndifferent births, and various descents upon the earth, he cannot give a\nsufficient recompense to those who have imparted knowledge to him: but please\nto direct that we should make you a present according to our power; and we\nwill bestow it to the utmost limit of our means; and receiving your blessing\nreturn home."\n\nWhen Shree Krishnu and Bulram had thus spoken, Sandeepun, the sage, rose up,\nand engaged in thought and reflection returned home. He explained to his wife,\n"That the two children, Bulram and Krishnu, are immortal deities, and have\ndescended upon the earth for the sake of their worshippers, and to remove the\nburthens of the world. I have discovered this secret by witnessing their\nsports; because they, who read continually in several successive births,\ncannot fathom the depths of sea-like knowledge, and behold they have, in this\nstate of infancy, passed over this limitless and unfordable sea in a few days:\nthey can accomplish whatever they wish in a single second." The sage added,\n"What boon shall we ask of them, wife?"\n\nOn hearing these words, she thought for a short time and said "Go and ask them\nfor our deceased son\'s corpse; they will bring it to us, if they possess the\npowers of Huri."\n\np. 169\n\nHaving thus reflected, Sandeepun, the sage, came out of his house with his\nwife, into the presence of Shree Krishnu and Buldeo, and joining his hands\nsaid, in a supplicating manner, "O great king! I had a son, with whom, on a\ncertain festival, I went, accompanied by my relations, to bathe in the sea,\nwhen we arrived there, and all having undressed began to bathe, a great wave\nof the sea came, in which my son was drowned, and did not come forth again.\nSome shark must have swallowed him, I am greatly grieved for his loss, if you\ndesire to make me a present, as your spiritual preceptor, restore that son,\nand remove the affliction of my mind."\n\nOn hearing these words, Shree Krishnu and Bulram, having made obeisance to\ntheir spiritual preceptor and his wife, and having ascended their ruth, went\ntowards the sea for the purpose of bringing their son; and, having proceeded\non their journey for some time, arrived on the shore. Seeing them approach in\nangry mood, the sea was alarmed, and assuming mortal shape came forth with\nmany presents from her own element, and stood on the shore before them\ntrembling, and greatly agitated with fear; placing her presents before them,\nand bowing her head, and making submissive salutations, she said with joined\nhands, and in a tone of supplication, "Great is my good fortune, that Krishnu\nhas appeared to me, for what purpose have you come here?" Shree Krishnu Chund\nsaid, "My spiritual preceptor came here with his relatives to bathe; whose son\nyou swept away with a wave; bring him here, and give him up to us. This is the\npurpose for which we have come."\n\nThe sea replied, bowing her head, "I have not overwhelmed him with a wave. You\nare the spiritual guide of all, and lord of the universe, and are the deity\nunder the form of Ramu. I have been very much afraid since this circumstance\noccurred, and have continued to live with a regard to the dignity of my\ncharacter and my limits." Huri replied, "If you did not take him off, who else\ndid so?" The sea said,\n\np. 170\n\n[paragraph continues] "O lord of compassion! I will explain the mystery: there\nis a demon, named Sunkasoor, in the form of a shell, who dwells in me, and who\nexercises tyranny over all animals, moving in the water, and carries off all\nwho come to the shore to bathe; perhaps he may have taken away your\npreceptor\'s son. I do not know certainly that he has done so; but be pleased\nto come into the sea yourself and ascertain."\n\nOn hearing these words Krishnu went eagerly into the sea; on beholding\nSunkhasoor, he killed him, and splitting his belly, cast out his entrails. He\ndid not find his spiritual preceptor\'s son; and in consequence thereof,\nexpressed regret to Bulbhudru, saying, "Brother! I have destroyed Sunkhasoor\nto no purpose." Bulram Jee replied, "It does not matter, carry him now about\nwith you." On hearing this Huri made that shell his weapon. The two brothers\nproceeding thence reached the city of Jum, the region of the dead, the name of\nwhich is Sunjumnee, and Dhurm Raj, the Raja thereof. On beholding them, Dhurm\nRaj descended from his throne, and advancing to meet them, gave them a most\nwelcome reception. Having seated them on a throne, washed their feet, and\ntaken the water with which their feet had been washed, he said, "Happy is this\nplace! fortunate this city! which Krishnu has visited, and fulfilled the\nsupplications of his worshippers. Give me some business to perform for you,\nthat your servant may execute it." Krishnu replied, "Bring the son of my\nspiritual preceptor."\n\nWhen Huri had thus spoken, Dhurm Raj went off immediately and brought the\nchild, and joining his hands said in a tone of submission, "O lord of\ncompassion! through your favour I knew, beforehand, that you would come to\nfetch the child, and have therefore taken the greatest care of him; and have\nnot yet restored him to life." O great king! with these words Dhurm Raj,\npresented the child to Huri, who immediately placed him upon his ruth, and\nproceeding thence conveyed him in a short time to the presence of his\nspiritual\n\np. 171\n\npreceptor. The two brothers, joining their hands said, "O divine preceptor!\nwhat further orders have you for us?"\n\nOn hearing these words, and seeing his son, Sandeepun, the sage, was highly\ndelighted, and bestowing many benedictions on Shree Krishnu and Bulram Jee\nsaid, "What more shall I ask, O Krishnu! you have conferred the greatest\nhappiness on me by restoring my son. Great will be my renown from having had\nsuch pupils as you. Return home now; and may you have a safe and pleasant\njourney."\n\nWhen the spiritual preceptor had given them this injunction, the two brothers\ndeparted, after the usual ceremonies of obtaining permission to go, and\nsalutation; and ascending their ruth proceeded on their journey, and arrived\nat Muttra. On hearing of their arrival, the Raja Oogursen, together with\nBasoodeo and the inhabitants of the city, both male and female, came forth to\nmeet them. They met them outside the city, and being greatly pleased brought\nKrishnu into the city in musical procession, spreading silken cloths on the\nroad for him to walk upon. There were rejoicings and festivities in every\nhouse.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XLVII](psa48.htm)\n\n'
