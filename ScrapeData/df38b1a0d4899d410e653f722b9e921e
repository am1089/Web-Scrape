[1897], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n10:5:1\n\n### FIFTH ADHY\xc3\x82YA. FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n10:5:1:11\\. The mystic import of this Fire-altar, doubtless, is Speech; for it\nis with speech that it is built: with the _Ri_ _k_ , the Ya _g_ us and the\nSaman as the divine (speech); and when he (the Adhvaryu) speaks with human\nspeech, 'Do ye this! do ye that!' then also it (the altar) is built therewith.\n\n10:5:1:22\\. Now, this speech is threefold--the _Ri_ k-verses, the Ya _g_ us-\nformulas, and the Saman-tunes;--thereby the Fire-altar is threefold, inasmuch\nas it is built with that triad. Even thus, then, it is threefold; but in this\nrespect also it is threefold, inasmuch as three kinds of bricks are put into\nit--those with masculine names, those with feminine names, and those with\nneuter names; and these limbs of men also are of three kinds--those with\nmasculine names, those with feminine names, and those with neuter names.\n\np. 365\n\n10:5:1:33\\. This body (of the altar), indeed, is threefold; and with this\nthreefold body he obtains the threefold divine Am _ri_ ta (nectar,\nimmortality). Now all these (bricks) are called 'ish _t_ aka (f.),' not 'ish\n_t_ aka _h_ (m.),' nor 'ish _t_ akam (n.):' thus (they are called) after the\nform of speech (va _k_ , f.), for everything here is speech--whether feminine\n(female), masculine (male), or neuter--for by speech everything here is\nobtained. Therefore he 'settles' all (the bricks) 1 with, 'A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like lie\nthou steady (dhruva, f.)!' not with, 'A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like lie thou steady (dhruva _h_\n, m.)!' or with, 'A\xe1\xb9\x85giras-like lie thou steady (dhruvam, n.)!' for it is that\nSpeech he is constructing.\n\n10:5:1:44\\. Now, this speech is yonder sun, and this (Agni, the Fire-altar) is\nDeath: hence whatsoever is on this side of the sun all that is field by Death;\nand he who builds it (the Fire-altar) on this side thereof, builds it as one\nheld by Death, and he surrenders his own self unto Death; but he who builds it\nthereabove, conquers recurring Death, for by his knowledge that (altar) of his\nis built thereabove.\n\n10:5:1:55\\. This speech, indeed, is threefold--the _Ri_ k-verses, the Ya _g_\nus-formulas, and the Saman-tunes the _Ri_ k-verses are the orb, the Saman-\ntunes the light, and the Ya _g_ us-formulas the man (in the sun); and that\nimmortal element, the shining light, is this lotus-leaf 2: thus, when he\nbuilds up the Fire-altar\n\np. 366\n\nafter laying down the lotus-leaf, it is on that immortal element that he\nbuilds for himself a body consisting of the _Ri_ k, the Ya _g_ us, and the\nSaman; and he becomes immortal.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[365:1](sbe4366.htm#fr_725) See VI, 1, 2, 28; VII, 1, 1, 30.\n\n[365:2](sbe4366.htm#fr_726) Viz. the lotus-leaf deposited in the centre of the\naltar-site, before the first layer is laid down, see VII, 4, 1, 7 seqq.,\nwhere, however, it is represented as symbolising the womb whence Agni (the\nfire-altar) is to be born.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 5, 2.
