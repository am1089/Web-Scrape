To the lord (of the sacrifice) only (the agent-ship in meditations\nbelongs), because scripture declares a fruit; this is the view of \xc3\x82treya.\n\nWith regard to meditations on subordinate members of sacrificial actions there\narises a doubt whether they are to be carried out by the sacrificer (i.e. him\nfor whom the sacrifice is performed) or by the officiating priests.--By the\nsacrificer, the purvapakshin maintains, because scripture declares fruits. For\na fruit is declared in such texts as the following one, 'There is rain for\nhim, and he brings rain for others who thus knowing meditates on the fivefold\nSaman as rain' ( _Kh_. Up. II, 3, 2); and we must conclude that that fruit\ngoes to the Lord of the sacrifice, because it is he who is entitled to the\nsacrificial performance together with its subordinate members, and because\nsuch meditations fall within the sphere of that to which he is entitled. And\nthat the fruit belongs to him who carries out the meditations scripture states\nwhen saying, 'There is rain for him who meditates.'--But scripture declares a\nfruit for the priest also, viz. in the passage, 'Whatever desire he may desire\neither for himself or for the sacrificer he obtains by his singing.'--That\npassage, we reply, is of no force because it expressly declares the fruit (as\nbelonging to the priest in a special case only). Hence the lord of the\nsacrifice only\n\np. 321\n\nis the agent in those meditations which have a fruit, this is the opinion of\nthe teacher \xc3\x82treya.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4, 45](sbe38254.htm)\n\n"
