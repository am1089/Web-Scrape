your feet shall tread  \nShores of the sea whose waves are red,  \nWhere spreading wide your eyes shall see  \nThe guilt-tormenting cotton tree  1  \nAnd the wild spot where Garud  2 dwells  \nWhich gems adorn and ocean shells,  \nHigh as Kallasa, nobly decked,  \nWrought by the heavenly architect.  3  \nHnge giants named Mandehas  4 there  \nIn each foul shape they love to wear,  \nNumbing the soul with terror\'s chill,  \nHang from the summit of the hill.  \nWhen darts the sun his earliest beam  \nThey plunge them in the ocean stream,  \nNew vigour from his rays obtain,  \nAnd hang upon the rocks again  \nSpeed onward still: your steps shall be  \nAt length beside the Milky Sea  \nWhose everv ripple as it curls  \nGleams glorious with its wealth of pearls.  \nAmid that sea like pale clouds spread  \nThe white Mount Rishabh  5 rears his head.  \nAbout the mountain\'s glorious waist  \nWoods redolent of bloom are braced.  \nA lake where lotuses unfold  \nTheir silver buds with threads of gold,  \nSudar*s\'an ever bright and fair  \nWhere white swans sport, lies gleaming there,  \nThe wandering Kinnar\'s  6 dear resort,  \nWhere heavenly nymphs and Yakshas  7 sport.  \n\nOn! leave the Milky Sea behind:  \nAnother flood your search shall find,  \nA waste of waters, wild and drear.  \nThat chills each living heart with fear.  \nThere see the horse\'s awful head,  \nWrath-born, that flames in Ocean\'s bed. 1b  \nThere rises up a fearful cry  \nFrom the sea things that move thereby,  \nWhen, helpless, powerless for flight,  \nThey gaze upon the horrid sight.  \nPast to the northern shore, and then  \nBeyond the flood three leagues and ten  \nYour wondering glances will behold  \nMount Jatarupa  2b bright with gold.  \nThere like the young moon pale of hue  \nThe monstrous serpent  3b will ye view,  \nThe earth\'s supporter, whose bright eyes  \nResemble lotus leaves in size.  \nHe rests upon the mountain\'s brow,  \nAnd all the Gods before him bow.  \nAnanta with a thousand heads  \nHis length in robes of azure spreads.  \nA triple-headed palm of gold--  \nMeet standard for the lofty-souled--  \nSprings towering from the mountain\'s crest  \nBeneath whose shade he loves to rest,  \nSo that in eastern realms each God  \nMay use it as a measuring-rod.  \nBeyond, with burning gold aglow,  \nThe eastern steep his peaks will show,  \nWhich in unrivalled glory rise  \nA hundred leagues to pierce the skies,  \nAnd all the neighbouring air is bright  \nWith golden trees that clothe the height.  \nA lofty peak uprises there  \nTen leagues in height and one league square  \n*Saumanas*, wrought of glistering gold,  \nNe\'er to be loosened from its hold.  \nThere his first step Lord Vishnu placed  \nWhen through the universe he paced,  \nAnd with his second lightly pressed  \nThe loftiest peak of Meru\'s crest.  \nWhen north of Jambudwip  4b the sun  \n\np. 374  \n\nA portion of his course has run.  \nAnd hangs above this mountain height,  \nThen creatures see the genial light.  \nVaikhanases, 1 saints far renowned,  \nAnd Balaklulvas, 2 love the ground  \nWhere in their glory half divine.  \nTouched by the morning glow, they shine  \nThe light that flashes from that steep  \nIllumines all Sudars\'andwip, 3  \nAnd on each creature, as it glows,  \nThe sight and strength of life bestows.  \nSearch well that mountain\'s woody side  \nIf Ravan there his captive hide.  \nThe rising sun, the golden hill  \nThe air with growing splendours fill,  \nTill flashes from the east the red  \nOf morning with the light they shed.  \nThis, where the sun begins his state,  \nIs earth and heaven\'s most eastern gate.  \nThrough all the mountain forest seek  \nBy waterfall and cave and peak.  \nSearch every nook and bosky dell,  \nIf Ravan there with Sita dwell.  \nThere, Vanars, there your steps must stay:  \nNo farther eastward can ye stray.  \nBeyond no sun, no moon given light,  \nBut all is sunk in endless night.  \nThus far, O Vanar lords, may you  \nO\'er sea and land your search pursue.  \nBut wild and dark and known to none  \nIs the drear space beyond the sun.  \nThat mountain whence the sun ascends  \nYour long and weary journey ends. 4  \nNow go, and in a month return,  \nAnd let success my praises earn,  \nHe who beyond tho month shall stay  \nWill with his life the forfeit pay.\'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c1b:1b](ry313.htm#fr_660) Gandhamadana, Angad,\nTara, Indrajanu, Rambha, Durmukha, Hanuman, Nala, Da mukha, S\'arabha, Kumuda,\nVahni.\n\n[\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c\xc3\x8c2b:2b](ry314.htm#fr_661) Daityas and Danavas\nare fiends and enemies of the Gods, life the Titans of Greek mythology.\n\n[372:1](ry314.htm#fr_662) I reduce the unwieldy numbers of the original to\nmore modest figures.\n\n[372:2](ry314.htm#fr_663) Sarayu now Sarju is the river on which Ayodhya was\nbuilt.\n\n[372:3](ry314.htm#fr_664) Kaus\'iki is a river which flows through Behar,\ncommonly called Kosi.\n\n[372:4](ry314.htm#fr_665) Bhagirath\'s daughter is Ganga or the Ganges.
