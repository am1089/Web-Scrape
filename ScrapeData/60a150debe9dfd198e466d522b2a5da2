THE ANSWER.\n\n1. 1 When a plaint of this description has been tendered by the plaintiff, the defendant shall deliver an answer corresponding to such plaint.\n\n2. 2 That is called a (true) answer by those acquainted with the subject, which meets the plaint, and is concise, clear, consistent, and easily intelligible without an explanation.\n\n3. 3 If a man's courage fails him when he is about to make a statement in a lawsuit, a delay must be\n\np. 240\n\ngranted to him (by the judge), whether he be plaintiff or defendant.\n\n4. 4 When the defendant contradicts the charge, such an answer is termed a denial in a cause.\n\n5. 5 When, the plaint having been reduced to writing by the plaintiff, the defendant admits it but adduces some special circumstance, it is called a (retort in the form) pratyavaskandana (special plea).\n\n6. 6 That (answer) is no (true) answer which is dubious, not to the point, too narrow, too extensive, or meeting one part only of the plaint.\n\n7\\. An answer which treats of a different subject, or which is incomplete, or\ncouched in obscure language, or confused, not intelligible without an\nexplanation, or unreasonable, will never enable (the defendant) to gain his\ncause.\n\np. 241\n\n8. 8 In the case of a denial, the burden of proof rests with the plaintiff; in the case of a special plea, (it rests) with the defendant.\n\n9. 9 Let (the plaintiff) make an answer which corresponds to (the contents of) the plaint. If he does not (make an answer), the king shall cause him to make one, by employing (any of) the (four) methods of conciliation, division, and the rest, till the matter has been cleared up.\n\n10. 10 When, in the case of a denial (on the part of the defendant) the plaintiff himself admits such (denial) as correct, it has to be considered as a confession, and one half of the (ordinary) fine shall be inflicted on the plaintiff.\n\n11. 11 In the case of a denial, the burden of proof rests with the plaintiff; in the case of a special plea,\n\np. 242\n\nit rests with the defendant; but in a plea of former judgment, all that is\nrequired in the shape of proof is to produce the previous decree.\n\n12. 12 The defendant is at liberty to delay his answer for three days, or for five days even.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[239:1](sbe3353.htm#fr_734) III, I.

'Which treats of a different subject,' as when an action for debt is\nanswered by referring to a different title of law, e.g. when a man being sued\nfor a debt of a hundred _S_ uvar _n_ as, replies, He (the plaintiff) has\nstruck me. 'Incomplete,' not containing any reference to the particulars of\ncountry, place, and so on, as when the plaint states a certain field situated\nin the central country (Madhyade _s_ a) near Benares, towards the east of it,\nto have been seized by the defendant, and the defendant replies merely, 'I p.\n241 have taken it.' 'Couched in obscure terms,' as when in a suit for a\nhundred _S_ uvar _n_ as the defendant exclaims, 'Am I the only person indebted\nto this man?' implying by his speech that the chief judge, or assessors, or\nplaintiff, is indebted to another man. 'Confused,' inconsistent, as when in an\naction for a hundred _S_ uvar _n_ as the defendant declares, 'Yes; I have\nreceived that sum, but I do not owe it.' 'Not intelligible without an\nexplanation,' owing to the use of wrong inflections, compounds, or\nconstructions, or to the employment of a foreign language. 'Unreasonable,'\ncontrary to common sense, as when the plaint runs as follows: The defendant\nhas received a hundred _S_ uvar _n_ as from me, repayable with interest, and\nhas paid the interest only, and not the principal; and the defendant replies:\n'Yes; I have paid the interest, but have not received the principal.'
