The slopes of the Himalayas and the banks of the rivers along their\nupper courses were dotted in past ages with hermitages, monasteries, and\ncolleges, which were the spring-heads of Indian civilisation and spirituality.\nA few of these still exist, while the shrines that are visited by multitudes\nof pious pilgrims are very numerous and of a sanctity unsurpassed. The most\nfamous are Mount Kailas, Lake Manasa Sarovara, Kedar Nath, Badri Narayan,\nHrishikesh, Hardwar, and Amarnath. The last-named (in Kashmir) was visited by\nSister Nivedita in company with the Swami Vivekananda, and is the subject of a\nchapter in _The Web of Indian Life_. The pilgrimage here described is that to\nthe group of sacred places situated in the Kumaon division of the United\nProvinces.\n\nHardwar is one of the seven holy places spoken of in the Puranas as especially\nleading to _Moksha_ , salvation. The town stands on the right bank of the\nGanges, close by the gorge through which the sacred river debouches on to the\nplains. It is the scene, every twelfth year, of a vast\n\np. 208\n\nassemblage of pilgrims, on the occasion of the _Kumbh Mela_.\n\nHrishikesh is distinguished among holy places by reason of the fact that it\nhas preserved intact its character as a hermitage and place of learning. Hindu\nascetics still live there in thatched huts, sleeping on grass-mats, content\nwith the barest necessities obtained by begging, speaking little or not at\nall, making spiritual culture and the pursuit of divine knowledge their sole\nconcern.\n\nSrinagar, a principal town of the Garhwal district, is of course to be\ndistinguished from the city of the same name in Kashmir. It stands on the left\nbank of the Alaknanda, the head stream of the Ganges, and owes its importance\nto its position on the pilgrim route. The old town was washed away in 1894, by\na flood caused through the bursting of the Gohn\xc4\x81 Lake.\n\nKedar Nath, immediately below the snow-peak of Mah\xc4\x81panth, at an elevation of\n11,753 feet, marks the spot where Shiva, in his flight from the Pandavas,\nassumed the form of a buffalo and dived into the earth, leaving his hind-\nquarters on the surface. Four miles from the temple, on the way to the\nMah\xc4\x81panth peak, is the precipice known as the Bhairab Jh\xc4\x81mp, whence sometimes\nthe devotee, in the ecstasy of attainment, would fling himself down.\n\nThe shrine of Badri Narayan is below the peak of Badrinath (23,210 feet). It\nstands on a shoulder of the mountain, at an elevation of 10,400 feet, on the\nroad from Srinagar to the Mana Pass. Tradition points to Sankaracharya as the\nfounder of the original temple.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Ship of Flowers](seh29.htm)\n\n'
