The enquiry into the nature of duty, however, does not form such\na prerequisite, since a consideration of the Vedanta-texts may be undertaken\nby any one who has read those texts, even if he is not acquainted with works.\n--But in the Vedanta-texts there are enjoined meditations on the Udgitha and\nthe like which;uc matters auxiliary to works; and such meditations are not\npossible for him who is not acquainted with those works!--You who raise this\nobjection clearly are ignorant of what kind of knowledge the _S_ ariraka Mima\n_m_ sa is concerned with! What that _s_ astra aims at is to destroy completely\nthat\n\np. 9\n\nwrong knowledge which is the root of all pain, for man, liable to birth, old\nage, and death, and all the numberless other evils connected with\ntransmigratory existence--evils that spring from the view, due to\nbeginningless Nescience, that there is plurality of existence; and to that end\nthe _s_ astra endeavours to establish the knowledge of the unity of the Self.\nNow to this knowledge, the knowledge of works--which is based on the\nassumption of plurality of existence--is not only useless but even opposed.\nThe consideration of the Udgitha and the like, which is supplementary to works\nonly, finds a place in the Vedanta-texts, only because like them it is of the\nnature of knowledge; but it has no direct connexion with the true topic of\nthose texts. Hence some prerequisite must be indicated which has reference to\nthe principal topic of the _s_ astra.--Quite so; and this prerequisite is just\nthe knowledge of works; for scripture declares that final release results from\nknowledge with works added. The Sutra-writer himself says further on 'And\nthere is need of all works, on account of the scriptural statement of\nsacrifices and the like' (Ve. Su. III, 4, 26). And if the required works were\nnot known, one could not determine which works have to be combined with\nknowledge and which not. Hence the knowledge of works is just the necessary\nprerequisite.--Not so, we reply. That which puts an end to Nescience is\nexclusively the knowledge of Brahman, which is pure intelligence and\nantagonistic to all plurality. For final release consists just in the\ncessation of Nescience; how then can works--to which there attach endless\ndifferences connected with caste, a _s_ rama, object to be accomplished, means\nand mode of accomplishment, &c.--ever supply a means for the cessation of\nignorance, which is essentially the cessation of the view that difference\nexists? That works, the results of which are transitory, are contrary to final\nrelease, and that such release can be effected through knowledge only,\nscripture declares in many places; compare all the passages quoted above ([p.\n7](sbe48004.htm#page_7)).\n\nAs to the assertion that knowledge requires sacrifices and other works, we\nremark that--as follows from the\n\np. 10\n\nessential contrariety of knowledge and works, and as further appears from an\naccurate consideration of the words of scripture--pious works can contribute\nonly towards the rise of the desire of knowledge, in so far namely as they\nclear the internal organ (of knowledge), but can have no influence on the\nproduction of the fruit, i.e. knowledge itself. For the scriptural passage\nconcerned runs as follows Brahma _n_ as desire to know him by the study of the\nVeda, by sacrifice, by gifts,' &c. (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22).\n\nAccording to this passage, the desire only of knowledge springs up through\nworks; while another text teaches that calmness, self-restraint, and so on,\nare the direct means for the origination of knowledge itself. (Having become\ntranquil, calm, subdued, satisfied, patient, and collected, he is to see the\nSelf within the Self (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4,23).\n\nThe process thus is as follows. After the mind of a man has been cleaned of\nall impurities through works performed in many preceding states of existence,\nwithout a view to special forms of reward, there arises in him the desire of\nknowledge, and thereupon--through knowledge itself originated by certain\nscriptural texts--'Being only, this was in the beginning, one only without a\nsecond' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, I, 2); 'Truth, Knowledge, the Infinite, is Brahman'\n(Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'Without parts, without actions, calm, without fault,\nwithout taint' ( _S_ vet. Up. VI, 19); 'This Self is Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. II,\n5, 19); 'Thou art that' ( _Kh._ Up. VI, 9, 7), Nescience comes to an end. Now,\n'Hearing,' 'reflection,' and 'meditation,' are helpful towards cognising the\nsense of these Vedic texts. 'Hearing' ( _s_ rava _n_ a) means the apprehension\nof the sense of scripture, together with collateral arguments, from a teacher\nwho possesses the true insight, viz. that the Vedanta-texts establish the\ndoctrine of the unity of the Self. 'Reflection' (mananam) means the\nconfirmation within oneself of the sense taught by the teacher, by means of\narguments showing it alone to be suitable. 'Meditation' (nididhyasanam)\nfinally means the constant holding of thai sense before one's mind, so as to\ndispel thereby the antagonistic bcginningless imagination of plurality. In the\ncase of him who\n\np. 11\n\nthrough 'hearing,' 'reflection,' and meditation,' has dis-dispelled the entire\nimagination of plurality, the knowledge of the sense of Vedanta-texts puts an\nend to Nescience; and what we therefore require is a statement of the\nindispensable prerequisites of such 'hearing,' 'reflection,' and so on. Now of\nsuch prerequisites there are four, viz. discrimination of what is permanent\nand what is non-permanent; the full possession of calmness of mind, self-\nrestraint and similar means; the renunciation of all enjoyment of fruits here\nbelow as well as in the next world; and the desire of final release.\n\nWithout these the desire of knowledge cannot arise; and they are therefore\nknown, from the very nature of the matter, to be necessary prerequisites. To\nsum up: The root of bondage is the unreal view of plurality which itself has\nits root in Nescience that conceals the true being of Brahman. Bondage itself\nthus is unreal, and is on that account cut short, together with its root, by\nmere knowledge. Such knowledge is originated by texts such as 'That art thou';\nand work is of no help either towards its nature, or its origination, or its\nfruit (i.e. release). It is on the other hand helpful towards the desire of\nknowledge, which arises owing to an increase of the element of goodness\n(sattva) in the soul, due to the destruction of the elements of passion (ra\n_g_ as) and darkness (tamas) which are the root of all moral evil. This use is\nreferred to in the text quoted above, 'Brahma _n_ as wish to know him,' &c.\nAs, therefore, the knowledge of works is of no use towards the knowledge of\nBrahman, we must acknowledge as the prerequisite of the latter knowledge the\nfour means mentioned above.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Small Siddhanta](sbe48006.htm)\n\n"
