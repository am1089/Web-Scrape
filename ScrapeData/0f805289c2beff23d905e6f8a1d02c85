The particular duty of a king is to protect (all) beings; by fulfilling it\n(he obtains) success (in this world and in the next). 1\n\n2\\. Those learned (in the sacred law) declare that to be free from fear and\npity is, indeed, a life-long sacrificial session (sattra, to be performed by\nthe king). 2\n\n3\\. Therefore let him appoint a domestic priest to (perform the rites)\nobligatory on the order of householders. 3\n\n4\\. It is declared in the Veda, 'A realm where a Brahma _n_ a is appointed\ndomestic priest, prospers;' 4\n\n5\\. For thus both (the special duties of a king and those of a householder)\nwill be fulfilled,\n\n6\\. And (the king alone is) unable (to do both).\n\n7\\. Let the king, paying attention to all the laws of countries, (subdivisions\nof) castes ( _g_ ati) and families, make the four castes (var _n_ a) fulfil\ntheir (respective) particular duties. 7\n\np. 97\n\n8\\. Let him punish those who stray from (the path of duty). 8\n\n9\\. But punishment must be awarded in cases of assault and abuse after (due\nconsideration of) the particular place and time (where and when the offence\nwas committed), of the duties, age, learning (of the parties), and the seat\n(of the injury), 9\n\n10\\. In accordance with (the precepts of) the (sacred) records and with\nprecedents.\n\n11\\. Let him not injure trees that bear fruit or flowers. 11\n\n12\\. (But) he may injure them in order to extend cultivation and (for\nsacrifices). 12\n\n13\\. The measures and weights of objects necessary for households must be\nguarded (against falsification). 13\n\n14\\. Let him not take property for his own use from (the inhabitants of) his\nrealm. 14\n\n15\\. The measures and price (of such property) only shall be liable to\ndeductions (in the shape of taxes).\n\np. 98\n\n16\\. .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     . 16\n\n17\\. On the march against the enemy the army which consists of companies of\nten, shall be able to perform a double (duty). 17\n\n18\\. In every (camp) there shall be places where water is distributed.\n\n19\\. Let him make one hundred men at the least engage in battle.\n\n20\\. The wives (of slain soldiers) shall be provided for.\n\n21\\. .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     . 21\n\n22\\. A ferry shall be taken away (from a river) in which there is no water. 22\n\n23\\. A _S_ rotriya is free from taxes, (and so are) a servant of the king, one\nwho has no protector, 23\n\np. 99\n\none who has left (the order of householders), an infant, a very aged man, a\nyoung man (who studies), and pradatas;\n\n24\\. (Moreover widows) who return to their former (family), unmarried maidens,\nand the wives of servants, 24\n\n25\\. He who swims with his arms (across a river in order to escape payment of\na toll at a ferry) shall pay one hundred times (the amount due). 25\n\n26\\. No taxes (shall be paid) on the usufruct of rivers, dry grass, forests,\n(places of) combustion, and mountains; 26\n\n27\\. Or those who draw their subsistence from them may pay (something),\n\n28\\. But he shall take a monthly tax from artisans. 28\n\n29\\. And when a king has died, let him give what is required for the occasion.\n29\n\np. 100\n\n30\\. It is hereby explained that (his) mother (must receive) maintenance.\n\n31\\. Let the king maintain the paternal and maternal uncles of the chief-\nqueen,\n\n32\\. As well as her other relatives.\n\n33\\. The wives of the (deceased) king shall receive food and raiment,\n\n34\\. Or if they are unwilling, they may depart. 34\n\n35\\. Let the king maintain eunuchs and madmen, 35\n\n36\\. Since their property goes to him.\n\n37\\. Now they quote also a verse proclaimed by Manu, which refers to duties\nand. taxes, 'No duty (is paid) on a sum less than a Karshapa _n_ a, there is\nno tax on a livelihood gained by art, nor on an infant, nor on a messenger,\nnor on what has been received as alms, nor on the remnants of property left\nafter a robbery, nor on a _S_ rotriya, nor on an ascetic, nor on a sacrifice.'\n37\n\np. 101\n\n38\\. A thief becomes free from guilt by entering (the royal presence) after\n(his deed and asking to be punished). 38\n\n39\\. But according to some (lawyers) he (who is caught) with weapons in his\nhands, with stolen goods in his possession, or covered with wounds is proved\n(to be a criminal). 39\n\n40\\. In case (a criminal) worthy of punishment is allowed to go free, the king\nshall fast during one (day and one) night;\n\n41\\. (And) his domestic priest during three (days and) nights.\n\n42\\. If an innocent man is punished, the domestic priest (shall perform) a K\n_ri_ _k_ _kh_ ra penance;\n\n43\\. (And) the king (shall fast) during three (days and) nights.\n\n44\\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'The slayer of a learned\nBrahma _n_ a casts his guilt on him who eats his food; an adulterous wife on\nher (negligent) husband; a student and a sacrificer on an (ignorant) teacher\n(and officiating priest); and a thief on the king (who pardons him).' 44\n\n45\\. 'But men who have committed offences and have received from kings the\npunishment (due to them), go pure to heaven, and (become) as holy as the\nvirtuous.' 45\n\n46\\. 'The guilt falls on the king who pardons an\n\np. 102\n\noffender. If he causes him to be slain, he destroys sin in accordance with the\nsacred law.'\n\n47\\. 'It is ordained that kings become at once pure (by bathing) when they\nhave done acts causing death. They are likewise (pure while engaged in\nbusiness) not causing death. Time is the reason for that.' 47\n\n48\\. And with reference to this (matter) they quote a verse proclaimed by\nYama, 'No taint of impurity, forsooth, falls on kings, on those engaged . in\npractising vows, or on those engaged in the performance of sacrificial session\n(sattra); for (the first) are seated on the throne of Indra, (and the others)\nare always equal to Brahman.' 48\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[96:1](sbe1422.htm#fr_551) **XIX**. Vish _n_ u III, 2.\n\n[96:2](sbe1422.htm#fr_552) Manu VIII, 306.\n\n[96:3](sbe1422.htm#fr_553) Vish _n_ u III, 70.\n\n[96:4](sbe1422.htm#fr_554) Gautama XI, 14.\n\n[96:7](sbe1422.htm#fr_555) Vish _n_ u III, 3; Gautama XI, 20.\n\n[97:8](sbe1422.htm#fr_556) Vish _n_ u III, 37.\n\n[97:9](sbe1422.htm#fr_557) Gautama XII, 51. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita has\ntwo Sutras instead of one, and reads the second hi _m_ sakro _s_ ayo _h_ kalpa\n_h_. The majority of the MSS. have, however, kalpa( _h_ ), which I consider to\nbe a mistake for kalpya _h_ , 'must be awarded.'\n\n[97:11](sbe1422.htm#fr_558) Vish _n_ u V, 55-56. The meaning of the Sutra is\nthat the king is to punish those who commit such acts.\n\n[97:12](sbe1422.htm#fr_559) The explicit permission to cut down trees for\nsacrificial purposes is given Vish _n_ u LI, 63.\n\n[97:13](sbe1422.htm#fr_560) Manu VIII, 403.\n\n[97:14](sbe1422.htm#fr_561)-15. The translation of these two Sutras is not\ncertain, because the words nihara and naiharika are not found elsewhere in the\nsense which has been attributed to them here. Still I think it very probable\nthat K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita's explanation nirhara and nirhare sadhu is\nright, and that the king is exhorted not to take the property of his subjects\nby force, but to levy taxes according to the value or the measure of the\narticles sold.\n\n[98:16](sbe1422.htm#fr_562) The Sutra has been left out, as the text is\ncorrupt, and I am unable to suggest any emendation. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_\nita's explanation is not worth giving.\n\n[98:17](sbe1422.htm#fr_563) 'The army which consists of companies of ten,'\ni.e. the lowest subdivision of which consists of ten parts, viz. one elephant,\none chariot, two horsemen, and three foot soldiers. Such a body is called a\npatti. The larger divisions, like the senamukha, 'battalion,' &c., are formed\nby three, nine, or twenty-seven pattis. Though I am unable to adduce any\npositive proof for it, vaha must, according to the connexion in which it\nstands, be a synonym of patti. 'The double duty' of the army is, according to\nK _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita, marching and fighting.\n\n[98:21](sbe1422.htm#fr_564) The Sutra is utterly corrupt, and cannot be\nrestored with the help of the MSS. at my disposal. It probably referred to the\namount of duties to be levied on goods sold in the market.\n\n[98:22](sbe1422.htm#fr_565) The meaning of the Sutra seems to be, that on\nthose rivers, where the water either runs off or is very low during the dry\nseason, the ferrymen must not be allowed to exact a toll from people crossing\nwithout their help. Such a rule would not be superfluous, as most Indian\nrivers are perfectly fordable between December and June, but impassable\nwithout boats in the other five months.\n\n[98:23](sbe1422.htm#fr_566) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 26, 10, 12-17; Manu VIII, 394. K\n_ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita to correctly points out that, though according to\nI, 43, all Brahma _n_ as are to be free from taxes, the _S_ rotriya or Vaidik\nis mentioned once more in order to show that a king, however distressed, must\nnot take anything from him (Manu VII, 133). K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita\nreads instead of pradatas, pradatara _h_ , 'very liberal men.' Manu loc. cit.\nexempts 'those who confer great benefits on priests of eminent learning' from\npaying taxes. His emendation would, therefore, be acceptable if the word\npradata _h_ did not occur in the same connexion above, XI, 7.\n\n[99:24](sbe1422.htm#fr_567) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 26, 11.\n\n[99:25](sbe1422.htm#fr_568) I read with the majority of the MSS.\nbahubhyamuttara _\xc3\xb1_ _kh_ ataguna _m_ dadyat.\n\n[99:26](sbe1422.htm#fr_569) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita explains daha,\n'(places of) combustion,' by agni, 'fire.' I am not certain what he means\nthereby. To me it seems most probable that Vasish _th_ a intends 'a place of\ncremation' (dahasthala), though it is just possible to refer the expression to\nthe jungle fires, which the aboriginal tribes light in the forests, in order\nto sow their Nagli in the ground manured by the ashes.\n\n[99:28](sbe1422.htm#fr_570) Gautama, X, 31.\n\n[99:29](sbe1422.htm#fr_571) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita refers this and the\nfollowing five Sutras to p. 100 the case where a king has conquered a foreign\ncountry; compare also Vish _n_ u III, 49-48. I think that Sutras 30-31\nconclusively show that these rules are intended to regulate the conduct of a\nking on the death of his predecessor and his own accession to the throne.\n\n[100:34](sbe1422.htm#fr_572) K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita thinks that the\nqueens unwilling to accept a bare subsistence may go wherever they like. I\nthink the word used in the text points rather to their becoming ascetics.\n\n[100:35](sbe1422.htm#fr_573) This rule refers apparently to eunuchs and insane\npersons left with money, but without near relatives, with whom they are united\nin interest. Vish _n_ u III, 65.\n\n[100:37](sbe1422.htm#fr_574) I translate the one word _s_ ulka by 'duties and\ntaxes.' The term has a great many different meanings in the law books, and is\nin this verse apparently used in two senses. K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita is\nof a different opinion, and thinks that the persons named are free from paying\na _s_ ulka in case they trade. The chief objection is that trading ascetics\nand _S_ rotriyas are not known to the ancient writers, though they are common\nenough in modern India.\n\n[101:38](sbe1422.htm#fr_575) This Sutra apparently alludes to a penitent thief\nwho con-fesses his crime and asks for punishment; see below, XX, 41.\n\n[101:39](sbe1422.htm#fr_576) Manu IX, 270; Narada V, 29-33 (Jolly). As given\nin the MSS. and by K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita, the Sutra is doubtlessly\ncorrupt. I read vra _n_ asampanno vyapadish _t_ a _h_.\n\n[101:44](sbe1422.htm#fr_577) Identical with Manu VIII, 317.\n\n[101:45](sbe1422.htm#fr_578) Identical with Manu VIII, 318.\n\n[102:47](sbe1422.htm#fr_579) Vish _n_ u XXII, 48; Manu V, 94.\n\n[102:48](sbe1422.htm#fr_580) Identical with Manu V, 93. 'Those engaged in\npractising vows' are, according to Kulluka and K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita,\nstudents learning the Veda.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XX](sbe1423.htm)\n\n"
