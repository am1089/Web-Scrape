THE ORIGIN OF YOGA\n\nThe basic problem of every living creature is survival in a hostile world.\nCountless generations ago, from the teeming human masses of the East, where\nman lived in ever-present dread of famine, disease, flood, invasion and\nvengeance of the gods, Yoga, a system or method of attaining physical and\nmental serenity under adverse and even horrible conditions, was introduced.\n\nMan, in his essence, has changed little in the course of historic time. The\nphilosophy of Yoga and its practice, which enabled the Indo-Aryan to survive\nthe stresses of his time, can also enable people of the modern Western world\nto achieve contentment and security in the face of the cold war, the hydrogen\nbomb, missile, counter-missile and counter-counter-missile and other perils in\na rapidly changing world.\n\nScholars who have attempted to trace the beginnings of the practice of Yoga\nhave found that its principles were well established as far back as the time\nwhen the written word was new. There are many "books" of Yoga among the oldest\nscripts in Sanskrit, the ancient sacred language of India. Even these refer to\na distant past in which the secrets of Yoga were passed on from generation to\ngeneration by word of mouth. Only the Indian form of Yoga is well known in\n\np. 6\n\n[paragraph continues] America and Europe, but there is strong evidence that\nYoga principles were known to the Egyptians and Chinese and that there were\nmonastic societies among the Hebrew Essenes who were, from reliable historical\nevidence, groups of Yoga practitioners. Perhaps the recent discovery of the\nDead Sea Scrolls will reveal some of the secrets of this philosophy that have\nbeen lost in the shadows of the years.\n\n#### What Is Yoga?\n\nThe word "Yoga" cannot be translated into English. In the Sanskrit, it derives\nfrom the root "Yuja," which is to join or weld together. Just as two pieces of\nmetal are welded together to become one, so in the philosophy of Yoga, the\nembodied spirit of the individual becomes one with the Universal Spirit\nthrough the regular practice of certain physical and mental exercises. In\nanother definition, Yoga is the art of life and its philosophy is meant to\nfurnish the principles that justify and explain that art.\n\nOne of the Sanskrit texts, the Bhagwad-Gita, describes Yoga as equanimity of\nmind which results in efficiency of action. For those to whom Yoga represents\na religion as well as a way of life, Yoga means the union or linking together\nof man with God, or the disunion or separation of man from the objects of\nphysical sensation in the material world. It is the science or skill which\nleads the initiate by easy steps to the pinnacle of self-realization.\n\nThere are many common misconceptions which stand between the truths of Yoga\nand those who live in the Western world. Many Americans have heard more about\nYogis, or those who practice Yoga, than about Yoga itself. They picture the\nYogi as an Indian fakir, swathed in rags, who spends his life on a bed of\nnails or sits motionless underneath\n\np. 7\n\na tree until birds build nests in his hair. Their knowledge of Yoga is gained\nfrom supposedly esoteric literature or from side-show performers billed as\n"Swamis" or "Yogis" who stick pins through their flesh or permit themselves to\nbe buried alive. More charitably, they may think of the Yoga convert as some\nmildly eccentric individual who enjoys standing on his head before breakfast.\n\nNevertheless, the true spirit and practice of Yoga has already spread to this\ncountry and has achieved what might be called a high degree of respectability.\nA number of colleges and universities, including such institutions as the\nUniversity of Southern California, offer courses in Yoga. Also, such prominent\nathletes as Parry O\'Brien, long-time holder of the world\'s shot-put record,\nhave studied and practiced Yoga. It has spread even to the halls of our\nnational Congress where Representative Francis P. Bolton\'s practice of Yoga\nhas received nationwide press coverage. Stripping the "magic" from Yoga\nreveals that it is a practice that effectively enables its user to meet the\nstresses of modern life, and offers relaxation that may stand between its\nadherents and the stomach ulcers or psychiatrist\'s couch that are so common\ntoday.\n\nYou need not retire to an "Ashram," or Yoga retreat, to acquire the benefits\nof this system; rather, you can attain the serenity and relaxation that it\naffords through the information in this volume. Practicing Yoga takes but a\nfew moments a day, although Yoga itself gradually fills the entire day of the\nperson who pursues it with faith and belief.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2.
