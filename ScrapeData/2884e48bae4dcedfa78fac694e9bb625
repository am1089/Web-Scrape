The non-existence (of external things) cannot be maintained, on account\nof (our) consciousness (of them).\n\nThere having been brought forward, in what precedes, the various objections\nwhich lie against the doctrine of the reality of the external world (in the\nBauddha sense), such as the impossibility of accounting for the existence of\naggregates, &c., we are now confronted by those Bauddhas who maintain that\nonly cognitions (or ideas, vi _g \xc3\xb1_ana) exist.--The doctrine of the reality of\nthe external world was indeed propounded by Buddha conforming himself to the\nmental state of some of his disciples whom he perceived to be attached to\nexternal things; but it does not represent his own true view according to\nwhich cognitions alone are real.\n\nAccording to this latter doctrine the process, whose constituting members are\nthe act of knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the result of knowledge 1,\nis an altogether internal one, existing in so far only as it is connected with\nthe mind (buddhi). Even if external things existed, that process could not\ntake place but in connexion with the mind. If, the Bauddhas say, you ask how\nit is known that that entire process is internal and that no outward things\nexist apart from consciousness, we reply that we base our\n\np. 419\n\ndoctrine on the impossibility of external things. For if external things are\nadmitted, they must be either atoms or aggregates of atoms such as posts and\nthe like. But atoms cannot be comprehended under the ideas of posts and the\nlike, it being impossible for cognition to represent (things as minute as)\natoms. Nor, again, can the outward things be aggregates of atoms such as\npillars and the like, because those aggregates can neither be defined as\ndifferent nor as non-different from the atoms 1.--In the same way we can show\nthat the external things are not universals and so on 2.\n\nMoreover, the cognitions--which are of a uniform nature only in so far as they\nare states of consciousness--undergo, according to their objects, successive\nmodifications, so that there is presented to the mind now the idea of a post,\nnow the idea of a wall, now the idea of a jar, and so on. Now this is not\npossible without some distinction on the part of the ideas themselves, and\nhence we must necessarily admit that the ideas have the same forms as their\nobjects. But if we make this admission, from which it follows that the form of\nthe objects is determined by the ideas, the hypothesis of the existence of\nexternal things becomes altogether gratuitous. From the fact, moreover, of our\nalways being conscious of the act of knowledge and the object of knowledge\nsimultaneously it follows that the two are in reality identical. When we are\nconscious of the one we are conscious of the other also; and that would not\nhappen if the two were essentially distinct, as in that case there would be\nnothing to prevent our being conscious of one apart from the other. For this\nreason also we maintain that there are no outward things.--\n\np. 420\n\n[paragraph continues] Perception is to be considered as similar to a dream and\nthe like. The ideas present to our minds during a dream, a magical illusion, a\nmirage and so on, appear in the twofold form of subject and object, although\nthere is all the while no external object; hence we conclude that the ideas of\nposts and the like which occur in our waking state are likewise independent of\nexternal objects; for they also are simply ideas.--If we be asked how, in the\nabsence of external things, we account for the actual variety of ideas, we\nreply that that variety is to be explained from the impressions left by\nprevious ideas 1. In the beginningless sa _m_ sara ideas and mental\nimpressions succeed each other as causes and effects, just as the plant\nsprings from the seed and seeds are again produced from the plant, and there\nexists therefore a sufficient reason for the variety of ideas actually\nexperienced. That the variety of ideas is solely due to the impressions left\non the mind by past ideas follows, moreover, from the following affirmative\nand negative judgments: we both (the Vedantins as well as the Bauddhas) admit\nthat in dreams, &c. there presents itself a variety of ideas which arise from\nmental impressions, without any external object; we (the Bauddhas) do not\nadmit that any variety of ideas can arise from external objects, without\nmental impressions.--Thus we are again led to conclude that no outward things\nexist.\n\nTo all this we (the Vedantins) make the following reply.--The non-existence of\nexternal things cannot be maintained because we are conscious of external\nthings. In every act of perception we are conscious of some external thing\ncorresponding to the idea, whether it be a post or a wall or a piece of cloth\nor a jar, and that of which we are conscious cannot but exist. Why should we\npay attention to the words of a man who, while conscious of an outward thing\nthrough its approximation to his senses, affirms that he is conscious of no\noutward thing, and that no such thing exists,\n\np. 421\n\nany more than we listen to a man who while he is eating and experiencing the\nfeeling of satisfaction avers that he does not eat and does not feel\nsatisfied?--If the Bauddha should reply that he does not affirm that he is\nconscious of no object but only that he is conscious of no object apart from\nthe act of consciousness, we answer that he may indeed make any arbitrary\nstatement he likes, but that he has no arguments to prove what he says. That\nthe outward thing exists apart from consciousness, has necessarily to be\naccepted on the ground of the nature of consciousness itself. Nobody when\nperceiving a post or a wall is conscious of his perception only, but all men\nare conscious of posts and walls and the like as objects of their perceptions.\nThat such is the consciousness of all men, appears also from the fact that\neven those who contest the existence of external things bear witness to their\nexistence when they say that what is an internal object of cognition appears\nlike something external. For they practically accept the general\nconsciousness, which testifies to the existence of an external world, and\nbeing at the same time anxious to refute it they speak of the external things\nas 'like something external.' If they did not themselves at the bottom\nacknowledge the existence of the external world, how could they use the\nexpression 'like something external?' No one says, 'Vish _n_ umitra appears\nlike the son of a barren mother.' If we accept the truth as it is given to us\nin our consciousness, we must admit that the object of perception appears to\nus as something external, not like something external.--But--the Bauddha may\nreply--we conclude that the object of perception is only like something\nexternal because external things are impossible.--This conclusion we rejoin is\nimproper, since the possibility or impossibility of things is to be determined\nonly on the ground of the operation or non-operation of the means of right\nknowledge; while on the other hand, the operation and non-operation of the\nmeans of right knowledge are not to be made dependent on preconceived\npossibilities or impossibilities. Possible is whatever is apprehended by\nperception or some other means of proof; impossible is what is not so\napprehended. Now the external things are,\n\np. 422\n\naccording to their nature, apprehended by all the instruments of knowledge;\nhow then can you maintain that they are not possible, on the ground of such\nidle dilemmas as that about their difference or non-difference from atoms?--\nNor, again, does the non-existence of objects follow from the fact of the\nideas having the same form as the objects; for if there were no objects the\nideas could not have the forms of the objects, and the objects are actually\napprehended as external.--For the same reason (i.e. because the distinction of\nthing and idea is given in consciousness) the invariable concomitance of idea\nand thing has to be considered as proving only that the thing constitutes the\nmeans of the idea, not that the two are identical. Moreover, when we are\nconscious first of a pot and then of a piece of cloth, consciousness remains\nthe same in the two acts while what varies are merely the distinctive\nattributes of consciousness; just as when we see at first a black and then a\nwhite cow, the distinction of the two perceptions is due to the varying\nblackness and whiteness while the generic character of the cow remains the\nsame. The difference of the one permanent factor (from the two--or more--\nvarying factors) is proved throughout by the two varying factors, and vice\nversa the difference of the latter (from the permanent factor) by the presence\nof the one (permanent factor). Therefore thing and idea are distinct. The same\nview is to be held with regard to the perception and the remembrance of a jar;\nthere also the perception and the remembrance only are distinct while the jar\nis one and the same; in the same way as when conscious of the smell of milk\nand the taste of milk we are conscious of the smell and taste as different\nthings but of the milk itself as one only.\n\nFurther, two ideas which occupy different moments of time and pass away as\nsoon as they have become objects of consciousness cannot apprehend--or be\napprehended by--each other. From this it follows that certain doctrines\nforming part of the Bauddha system cannot be upheld; so the doctrine that\nideas are different from each other; the doctrine that everything is\nmomentary, void, &c.; the doctrine of the distinction of individuals and\nclasses; the\n\np. 423\n\ndoctrine that a former idea leaves an impression giving rise to a later idea;\nthe doctrine of the distinction, owing to the influence of Nescience, of the\nattributes of existence and non-existence; the doctrine of bondage and release\n(depending on absence and presence of right knowledge) 1.\n\nFurther, if you say that we are conscious of the idea, you must admit that we\nare also conscious of the external thing. And if you rejoin that we are\nconscious of the idea on its own account because it is of a luminous nature\nlike a lamp, while the external thing is not so; we reply that by maintaining\nthe idea to be illuminated by itself you make yourself guilty of an absurdity\nno less than if you said that fire burns itself. And at the same time you\nrefuse to accept the common and altogether rational opinion that we are\nconscious of the external thing by means of the idea different from the thing!\nIndeed a proof of extraordinary philosophic insight!--It cannot, moreover, be\nasserted in any way that the idea apart from the thing is the object of our\nconsciousness; for it is absurd to speak of a thing as the object of its own\nactivity. Possibly you (the Bauddha) will rejoin that, if the idea is to be\napprehended by something different from it, that something also must be\napprehended by something different and so on ad infinitum. And, moreover, you\nwill perhaps object that as each cognition is of an essentially illuminating\nnature like a lamp, the assumption of a further cognition is uncalled for; for\nas they are both equally illuminating the one cannot give light to the other.\n--But both these objections are unfounded. As the idea only is apprehended,\nand there is consequently no necessity to assume something to apprehend the\nSelf which witnesses the idea (is conscious of the idea), there results no\nregressus ad infinitum. And the witnessing Self and the idea are of an\nessentially different nature, and may therefore stand to each other in the\nrelation of knowing subject and object known. The existence of the witnessing\n\np. 424\n\n[paragraph continues] Self is self-proved and cannot therefore be denied.--\nMoreover, if you maintain that the idea, lamplike, manifests itself without\nstanding in need of a further principle to illuminate it, you maintain thereby\nthat ideas exist which are not apprehended by any of the means of knowledge,\nand which are without a knowing being; which is no better than to assert that\na thousand lamps burning inside some impenetrable mass of rocks manifest\nthemselves. And if you should maintain that thereby we admit your doctrine,\nsince it follows from what we have said that the idea itself implies\nconsciousness; we reply that, as observation shows, the lamp in order to\nbecome manifest requires some other intellectual agent furnished with\ninstruments such as the eye, and that therefore the idea also, as equally\nbeing a thing to be illuminated, becomes manifest only through an ulterior\nintelligent principle. And if you finally object that we, when advancing the\nwitnessing Self as self-proved, merely express in other words the Bauddha\ntenet that the idea is self-manifested, we refute you by remarking that your\nideas have the attributes of originating, passing away, being manifold, and so\non (while our Self is one and permanent).--We thus have proved that an idea,\nlike a lamp, requires an ulterior intelligent principle to render it manifest.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[418:1](sbe34204.htm#fr_409) According to the vi _g \xc3\xb1_anavadin the cognition\nspecialised by its various contents, such as, for instance, the idea of blue\ncolour is the object of knowledge; the cognition in so far as it is\nconsciousness (avabhasa) is the result of knowledge; the cognition in so far\nas it is power is mana, knowledge; in so far as it is the abode of that power\nit is pramat _ri_ , knowing subject.\n\n[419:1](sbe34204.htm#fr_410) If they are said to be different from the atoms\nthey can no longer be considered as composed of atoms; if they are non-\ndifferent from atoms they cannot be the cause of the mental representations of\ngross non-atomic bodies.\n\n[419:2](sbe34204.htm#fr_411) Avayavavayavirupo vahyo#rtho nasti _k_ en ma bhud\n_g_ ativyaktyadirupas tu syad ity a _s_ a _n_ kyaha evam iti. _G_ atyadina _m_\nvyaktyadinam _k_ atyantabhinnatve svatantryaprasa _n_ gad atyantabhinnatve\ntadvadevatadbhavad bhinnabhinnatvasya viruddhatvad avayavavayavibhedava _g_\ngativyaktyadibhedo#pi nastity artha _h_.\n\n[420:1](sbe34204.htm#fr_412) Vasana, above translated by mental impression,\nstrictly means any member of the infinite series of ideas which precedes the\npresent actual idea.\n\n[423:1](sbe34204.htm#fr_413) For all these doctrines depend on the comparison\nof ideas which is not possible unless there be a permanent knowing subject in\naddition to the transitory ideas.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 29](sbe34205.htm)\n\n"
