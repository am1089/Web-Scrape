And on account of the distinctive qualities (mentioned).\n\nMoreover, the distinctive qualities mentioned in the text agree only with the\nindividual Self and the highest Self. For in a subsequent passage (I, 3, 3),\n'Know the Self to be the charioteer, the body to be the chariot,' which\ncontains the simile of the chariot, the individual soul is represented as a\ncharioteer driving on through transmigratory existence and final release,\nwhile the passage (9), 'He reaches the end of his journey, and that is the\nhighest place of Vish _n_ u,' represents the highest Self as the goal of the\ndriver's course. And in a preceding passage also, (I, 2, 12, 'The wise, who by\nmeans of meditation on his Self, recognises the Ancient who is difficult to be\nseen, who has entered into the dark, who is hidden in the cave, who dwells in\nthe abyss, as God, he indeed leaves joy and sorrow far behind,') the same two\nbeings are distinguished as thinker and as object of thought. The highest Self\nis, moreover, the general topic. And further, the clause, 'Those who know\nBrahman call them,' &c., which brings forward a special class of speakers, is\nin its place only if the highest Self is accepted (as one of the two beings\nspoken of). It is therefore evident that the passage under discussion refers\nto the individual soul and the highest Self.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to the passage (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1), 'Two birds,\ninseparable friends,' &c. There also the Self is the general topic, and hence\nno two ordinary birds can be meant; we therefore conclude from the\ncharacteristic mark of eating, mentioned in the passage, 'One of them eats the\nsweet fruit,' that the individual soul is meant, and from\n\np. 122\n\nthe characteristic marks of abstinence from eating and of intelligence,\nimplied in the words, 'The other looks on without eating,' that the highest\nSelf is meant. In a subsequent mantra again the two are distinguished as the\nseer and the object of sight. 'Merged into the same tree (as it were into\nwater) man grieves at his own impotence (ani _s_ a), bewildered; but when he\nsees the other Lord (i _s_ a) contented and knows his glory, then his grief\npasses away.'\n\nAnother (commentator) gives a different interpretation of the mantra, 'Two\nbirds inseparable,' &c. To that mantra, he says, the final decision of the\npresent head of discussion does not apply, because it is differently\ninterpreted in the Pai _n_ gi-rahasya Brahma _n_ a. According to the latter\nthe being which eats the sweet fruit is the sattva; the other being which\nlooks on without eating, the individual soul ( _g \xc3\xb1_a); so that the two are\nthe sattva and the individual soul (kshetra _g \xc3\xb1_a). The objection that the\nword sattva might denote the individual soul, and the word kshetra _g \xc3\xb1_a, the\nhighest Self, is to be met by the remark that, in the first place, the words\nsattva and kshetra _g \xc3\xb1_a have the settled meaning of internal organ and\nindividual soul, and are in the second place, expressly so interpreted there,\n(viz. in the Pai _n_ gi-rahasya,) 'The sattva is that by means of which man\nsees dreams; the embodied one, the seer, is the kshetra _g \xc3\xb1_a; the two are\ntherefore the internal organ and the individual soul.' Nor does the mantra\nunder discussion fall under the purvapaksha propounded above. For it does not\naim at setting forth the embodied individual soul, in so far as it is\ncharacterised by the attributes connected with the transmigratory state, such\nas acting and enjoying; but in so far rather as it transcends all attributes\nconnected with the sa _m_ sara and is of the nature of Brahman, i.e. is pure\nintelligence; as is evident from the clause, 'The other looks on without\neating.' That agrees, moreover, with _s_ ruti and sm _ri_ ti passages, such\nas, 'That art thou,' and 'Know me also to be the individual soul' (Bha. Gita\nXIII, 2). Only on such an explanation of the passage as the preceding one\nthere is room for the declaration made in the concluding passage of the\nsection, 'These two are the sattva and the kshetra _g \xc3\xb1_a; to him indeed\n\np. 123\n\nwho knows this no impurity attaches 1.--But how can, on the above\ninterpretation, the non-intelligent sattva (i.e. the internal organ) be spoken\nof as an enjoyer, as is actually done in the clause, 'One of them eats the\nsweet fruit?'--The whole passage, we reply, does not aim at setting forth the\nfact that the sattva is an enjoyer, but rather the fact that the intelligent\nindividual soul is not an enjoyer, but is of the nature of Brahman. To that\nend 2 the passage under discussion metaphorically ascribes the attribute of\nbeing an enjoyer to the internal organ, in so far as it is modified by\npleasure, pain, and the like. For all acting and enjoying is at the bottom\nbased on the non-discrimination (by the soul) of the respective nature of\ninternal organ and soul; while in reality neither the internal organ nor the\nsoul either act or enjoy; not the former, because it is non-intelligent; not\nthe latter, because it is not capable of any modification. And the internal\norgan can be considered as acting and enjoying, all the less as it is a mere\npresentment of Nescience. In agreement with what we have here maintained,\nScripture ('For where there is as it were duality there one sees the other,'\n&c.; B _ri_. Up. IV, 5, 15) declares that the practical assumption of agents,\nand so on--comparable to the assumption of the existence of elephants, and the\nlike, seen in a dream--holds good in the sphere of Nescience only; while the\npassage, 'But when the Self only is all this, how should he see another?'\ndeclares that all that practically postulated existence vanishes for him who\nhas arrived at discriminative knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[123:1](sbe34049.htm#fr_146) Freedom from impurity can result only from the\nknowledge that the individual soul is in reality Brahman.
