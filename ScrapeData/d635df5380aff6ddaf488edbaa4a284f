Prayer to the kushtha-plant to destroy takman (fever), and other\nailments.\n\n1\\. May the protecting god kushtha come hither from the Himavant: destroy thou\nevery takman, and all female spooks!  \n2\\. Three names hast thou, O kushtha, (namely: kushtha), na-gha-mara\n('forsooth-no-death'), and na-gha-risha ('forsooth-no-harm'). Verily no harm\nshall suffer (na gha . . . rishat) this person here, for whom I bespeak thee\nmorn and eve, aye the (entire) day!  \n3\\. Thy mother's name is givala ('quickening'), thy father's name is givanta\n('living'). Verily no harm shall suffer this person here, for whom I bespeak\nthee morn and eve, aye the entire day!  \n4\\. Thou art the most superior of the plants, as a steer among cattle, as the\ntiger among beasts of prey. Verily no harm shall stiffer this person here, for\nwhom I bespeak thee morn and eve, aye the entire day!  \n5\\. Thrice begotten by the Sambu Angiras, thrice by the \xc3\x82dityas, and thrice by\nall the gods, this kushtha, a universal remedy, stands together with soma.\nDestroy thou every takman, and all female spooks!  \n6\\. The asvattha-tree is the seat of the gods in the third heaven from here.\nThere came to sight the amrita (ambrosia), there the kushtha-plant was born.  \n7\\. A golden ship with golden tackle moved upon the heavens. There came to\nsight the amrita, there the kushtha-plant was born.  \n8\\. On the spot where the ship glided down, on the peak of the Himavant, there\ncame to sight the ambrosia, there the kushtha-plant was born. This kushtha, a\nuniversal remedy, stands together with soma. Destroy thou every takman, and\nall female spooks!  \n9\\. (We know) thee whom Ikshvaku knew of yore, whom the women, fond of\nkushtha, knew, whom Vayasa and Matsya knew: therefore art thou a universal\nremedy.  \n10\\. The takman that returns on each third day, the one that cominues without\nintermission, and the yearly one, ao thou, (O plant) of unremitting strength,\ndrive away down below!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 12.
