Now follows the Mahavrata ceremony.\n\n2\\. After having killed V _ri_ tra, Indra became great. When he became great,\nthen there was the Mahavrata (the great work). This is why the Mahavrata\nceremony is called Mahavrata.\n\n3\\. Some people say: 'Let the priest make two (recitations with the offering\nof the) a _g_ ya (ghee) on that day,' but the right thing is one 1.\n\n4\\. He who desires prosperity should use the hymn, pra vo devayagnaye (Rv.\nIII, 13, 1).\n\n5\\. He who desires increase should use the hymn, vi _s_ o vi _s_ o atithim\n(Rv. VIII, 74, 1).\n\np. 158\n\n6\\. The people (visa _h_ ) indeed are increase 1, and therefore he (the\nsacrificer) becomes increased.\n\n7\\. But (some say), there is the word atithim (in that hymn, which means a\nguest or stranger, asking for food). Let him not therefore take that hymn.\nVerily, the atithi (stranger) is able 2 to go begging.\n\n8\\. 'No,' he said, 'let him take that hymn.\n\n9\\. 'For he who follows the good road and obtains distinction, he is an atithi\n(guest) 3.\n\n10\\. 'They do not consider him who is not so, worthy to be (called) an atithi\n(guest).\n\n11\\. 'Therefore let him by all means take that hymn.'\n\n12\\. If he takes that hymn, let him place the (second) tristich, aganma v _ri_\ntrahantamam, 'we came near to the victorious,' first.\n\n13\\. For people worship the whole year (performing the Gavamayana sacrifice)\nwishing for this day (the last but one)--they do come near.\n\n14\\. The (next following) three tristichs begin with an Anush _t_ ubh 4. Now\nBrahman is Gayatri, speech is Anush _t_ ubh. He thus joins speech with\nBrahman.\n\n15\\. He who desires glory should use the hymn, abodhy agni _h_ samidha gananam\n(Rv. V, 1, 1).\n\np. 159\n\n16\\. He who desires offspring and cattle should use the hymn, hota _g_ anish\n_t_ a _k_ etana _h_ (Rv. II, 5, 1).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[157:1](sbe01180.htm#fr_379) That it should be one only is proved from the\ntypes, i. e. from other sacrifices, that have to be followed in the\nperformance of the Mahavrata. The first type is the Agnish _t_ oma, where one\n_s_ astra is enjoined as a _g_ ya _s_ astra, viz. pra vo devayagnaye. In the\nVi _s_ va _g_ it, which has to follow the Agnish _t_ oma, another hymn is put\nin its place, viz. agni _m_ naro didhitibhi _h_. In the Mahavrata, which has\nto follow the Vi _s_ va _g_ it, some people recommend the use of both these\nhymns. But that is wrong, for there must be in the sacrifices which follow the\nAgnish _t_ oma twelve _s_ astras altogether; and if there were two here,\ninstead of one, we should get a total of thirteen.\n\n[158:1](sbe01180.htm#fr_380) The word visa _h_ , which occurs in the hymn,\nmeans people. The commentator says that because the Vai _s_ yas or\ntradespeople increase their capital, therefore they are called increase.\n\n[158:2](sbe01180.htm#fr_381) Able, or liable; cf. Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 3, 5, 7.\n\n[158:3](sbe01180.htm#fr_382) Atithi is here explained by yo bhavati, and\nbhavati is explained as walking on the good road. One expects yo va atati. The\nobtaining of distinction is probably derived from ati, above, in atithi.\n\n[158:4](sbe01180.htm#fr_383) In the first and second the Anush _t_ ubh is\nfollowed by two Gayatris.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 2](sbe01181.htm)\n\n"
