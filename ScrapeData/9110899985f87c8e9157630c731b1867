Now this Rajah had\na Wuzeer who was a very, very wise old man--and it came to pass that one day\nwhen he was travelling in a distant part of his kingdom, accompanied by this\nWuzeer and the rest of his court, he came upon a large garden, and in walking\nround it he was particularly struck by a little tree which grew there. It was\na bringal  1 tree, not above two feet in height. It had no leaves, but on it\ngrew a hundred and one bringals. The Rajah stopped to count them, and then\nturning to the Wuzeer in great astonishment said, 'It is to me a most\nunaccountable thing--that this little tree should have no leaves, but a\nhundred and one bringals growing on it. You are a wise man; can you guess what\nthis means?' The Wuzeer replied, 'I can interpret this marvel to you, but if I\ndo, you will most likely not believe me--promise therefore that if I tell you,\nyou will not cause me to be killed for having told (as you imagine) a lie.'\nThe Rajah promised, and the Wuzeer continued: 'The meaning of this little\nbringal tree, with the hundred and one bringals growing on it, is this:\nWhoever marries the daughter of the Malee in charge of this garden will have a\nhundred and one children--a hundred sons and one daughter.' The Rajah said,\n'Where is the maiden to be seen?' The Wuzeer answered, 'When a number of great\npeople like you and all your court come into a little village like this, the\npoor people, and especially the children, are frightened, and run away and\nhide themselves; therefore, as long as you stay here as Rajah you cannot hope\nto see her. Your only means will be to send away your suite, and cause it to\nbe announced that you have left the place. Then, if you walk daily in this\ngarden you may some morning meet the pretty Guzra Bai,  2 of whom I speak.'\n\nUpon this advice the Rajah acted; and one day, whilst walking in the garden,\nhe saw the Malee's young daughter, a girl of twelve years old, busy gathering\nflowers. He went forward to accost her, but she, seeing that he was not one of\nthe villagers, but a stranger, was shy, and ran home to her father's house.\n\nThe Rajah followed--for he was very much struck with her grace and beauty--in\nfact he fell in love with her as soon as he saw her, and thought he had never\nseen a king's daughter half so charming.\n\nWhen he got to the Malee's house the door was shut; so he called out, 'Let me\nin, good Malee; I am the Rajah, and I wish to marry your daughter.' The Malee\nonly laughed, and answered, 'A pretty tale to tell a simple man, indeed! You a\nRajah! why, the Rajah is miles away. You had better go home, my good fellow,\nfor there's no welcome for you here!' But the Rajah continued calling till the\nMalee opened the door--who then was indeed surprised, seeing it was truly no\nother than the Rajah--and he asked what he could do for him.\n\nThe Rajah said, 'I wish to marry your beautiful daughter Guzra Bai.' 'No, no,'\nsaid the Malee, 'this joke won't do. None of your Princes in disguise for me.\nYou may think you are a great Rajah and I only a poor Malee, but I tell you\nthat makes no difference at all. Though you were king of all the earth I would\nnot permit you to come here and amuse yourself chattering to my girl, only to\nfill her head with nonsense, and to break her heart.'\n\n'In truth, good man, you do me wrong,' answered the Rajah humbly; 'I mean what\nI say; I wish to marry your daughter.'\n\n'Do not think,' retorted the Malee, 'that I'll make a fool of myself because\nI'm only a Malee, and believe what you've got to say because you're a great\nRajah! Rajah or no Rajah is all one to me. If you mean what you say, if you\ncare for my daughter and wish to be married to her, come and be married; but\nI'll have none of your new-fangled forms, and court ceremonies hard to be\nunderstood; let the girl be married here by her father's hearth, and under her\nfather's roof, and let us invite to the wedding our old friends and\nacquaintance whom we 'ye known all our lives, and before we ever thought of\nyou.'\n\nThe Rajah was not angry, but amused, and rather pleased than otherwise at the\nold man's frankness, and he consented to all that was desired.\n\nThe village beauty, Guzra Bai, was therefore married with as much pomp as they\ncould muster, but in village fashion, to the great Rajah, who took her home\nwith him, followed by the tears and blessings of her parents and playmates.\n\nThe twelve kings' daughters were by no means pleased at this addition to the\nnumber of the Ranees; and they agreed amongst themselves that it would be\nhighly derogatory to their dignity to permit Guzra Bai to associate with them,\nand that the Rajah, their husband, had offered them an unpardonable insult in\nmarrying a Malee's daughter, which was to be revenged upon her the very first\nopportunity.\n\nHaving made this league, they tormented poor Guzra Bai so much, that, to save\nher from their persecutions, the Rajah built her a little house of her own,\nwhere she lived very, very happily for a short time.\n\nAt last one day he had occasion to go and visit a distant part of his\ndominions, but fearing his high-born wives might ill.use Guzra Bai in his\nabsence, at parting he gave her a little golden bell,' saying, 'If while I am\naway you are in any trouble, or any one should be unkind to you, ring this\nlittle bell, and wherever I am I shall instantly hear it, and will return to\nyour aid.'\n\nNo sooner had the Rajah gone, than Guzra Bai thought she would try the power\nof the bell. So she rang it. The Rajah instantly appeared. 'What do you want?'\nhe said. 'Oh, nothing,' she replied. 'I was foolish. I hardly believed what\nyou told me could be true, and thought I would try.' 'Now you will believe, I\nhope,' he said, and went away. A second time she rang the bell. Again the\nRajah returned. 'Oh, pardon me, husband,' she said; 'it was wrong of me not to\ntrust you, but I scarcely thought you could return again from so far.' 'Never\nmind,' he said, 'only do not try the experiment again.' And again he went\naway. A third time she rang the golden bell. 'Why do you ring again, Guzra\nBai?' asked the Rajah sternly,! It must have been a kind of telegraph, to go\nso quick,' my narrator said. as for a third time he returned. 'I don't know,\nindeed; indeed I beg your pardon,' she said; 'but I know not why, I felt so\nfrightened.' 'Have any of the Ranees been unkind to you?' he asked. 'No.\nnone,' she answered; 'in fact, I have seen none of them.' 'You are a silly\nchild,' said he, stroking her hair. 'Affairs of the state call me away. You\nmust try and keep a good heart till my return.' And for the fourth time he\ndisappeared.\n\nA little while after, Guzra Bai had a hundred and one children! a hundred boys\nand one girl. When the twelve Ranees heard this, they said to each other,\n'Guzra Bai, the Malee's daughter, will rank higher than us; she will have\ngreat power and influence as mother to the heir to the Raj; let us kill these\nchildren, and tell our husband that she is a sorceress; then will he love her\nno longer, and his old affection for us will return.' So the twelve Ranees all\nwent over to Guzra Bai's house. When Guzra Bai saw them coming, she feared\nthey meant to do her some harm, so she seized her little golden bell, and\nrang, and rang, and rang--but no Rajah came. She had called him back so often,\nthat he did not believe she really needed his help. And thus the poor woman\nwas left at the mercy of her implacable enemies.\n\nNow the nurse who had charge of the hundred and one babies was an old servant\nof the twelve Ranees, and moreover a very wicked woman, able and willing to do\nwhatever her twelve wicked old mistresses ordered. So when they said to her,\n'Can you kill these children?' she answered, 'Nothing is easier; I will throw\nthem out upon the dust-heap behind the palace, where the rats and hawks and\nvultures will have left none of them remaining by tomorrow morning.' 'So be\nit,' said the Ranees. Then the nurse took the hundred and one little innocent\nchildren--the hundred little boys and the one little girl--and threw them\nbehind the palace on the dust-heap, close to some large rat-holes; and after\nthat, she and the twelve Ranees placed a very large stone in each of the\nbabies' cradles, and said to Guzra Bai, 'Oh, you evil witch in disguise, do\nnot hope any longer to impose by your arts on the Rajah's credulity. See, your\nchildren have all turned into stones. See these, your pretty babies! '--and\nwith that they tumbled the hundred and one stones down in a great heap on the\nfloor. Then Guzra Bai began to cry, for she knew it was not true; but what\ncould one poor woman do against thirteen? At the Rajah's return the twelve\nRanees accused Guzra Bai of being a witch, and the nurse testified that the\nhundred and one children she had charge of had turned into stones, and the\nRaJah believed them rather than Guzra Bai, and he ordered her to be imprisoned\nfor life.\n\nMeanwhile a Bandicote  3 had heard the pitiful cries of the children, and\ntaking pity on them, dragged them all one by one into her hole, out of the way\nof kites and vultures. She next assembled all the Bandicotes from far and\nnear, and told them what she had done, begging them to assist in finding food\nfor the children. Then every day a hundred and one Bandicotes would come, each\nbringing a little bit of food in his mouth, and give it to one of the\nchildren; and so day by day they grew stronger and stronger, until they were\nable to run about, and then they used to play of a morning at the mouth of the\nBandicote's hole, running in there to sleep every night. But one fine day, who\nshould come by but the wicked old nurse! Fortunately, all the boys were in the\nhole, and the little girl, who was playing outside, on seeing her, ran in\nthere too, but not before the nurse had seen her. She immediately went to the\ntwelve Ranees and related this, saying, 'I cannot help thinking some of the\nchildren may still be living in those rat-holes. You had better send and have\nthem dug out and killed.' 'We dare not do that,' answered they, 'for fear of\ncausing suspicion; but we will order some labourers to dig up that ground and\nmake it into a field, and that will effectually smother any of the children\nwho may still be alive.' This plan was approved, and forthwith carried into\nexecution; but the good Bandicote, who happened that day to be out on a\nforaging expedition in the palace, heard all about it there, and immediately\nrunning home, took all the children from her hole to a large well some\ndistance off, where she hid them in the hollows behind the steps leading down\nto the water, laying one child under each step.\n\nHere they would have been quite safe, had not the Dhobee happened to go down\nto the well that day to wash some clothes, taking with him his little girl\nWhile her father was drawing up water, the child amused herself running up and\ndown the steps of the well. Now each time her weight pressed down a step it\ngave the child hidden underneath a little squeeze. All the hundred boys bore\nthis without uttering a sound; but when the Dhobee's child trod on the step\nunder which the little girl was hidden, she cried out, 'How can you be so\ncruel to me, trampling on me in this way? Have pity on me, for I am a little\ngirl as well as you.'\n\nWhen the child heard these words proceeding from the stone, she ran in great\nalarm to her father, saying, 'Father, I don't know what's the matter, but\nsomething alive is certainly under those stones. I heard it speak; but whether\nit is a Rakshas or an angel, or a human being, I cannot tell. Then the Dhobee\nwent to the twelve Ranees to tell them the wonderful news about the voice in\nthe well; and they said to each other, 'May be it's some of Guzra Bai's\nchildren; let us send and have this inquired into.' So they sent some people\nto pull down the well, and see if some evil spirit were not there.\n\nThen labourers went to pull down the well. Now close to the well was a little\ntemple dedicated to Gunputti, containing a small shrine, and a little clay\nimage of the god. When the children felt the well being pulled down they\ncalled out for help and protection to Gunputti, who took pity on them and\nchanged them into trees growing by his temple--a hundred little mango trees\nall round in a circle (which were the hundred little boys), and a little rose-\nbush in the middle, covered with red and white roses, which was the little\ngirl.\n\nThe labourers pulled down the well, but they found nothing there but a poor\nold Bandicote, which they killed. Then, by order of the twelve wicked Ranees,\nthey sacrilegiously destroyed the little temple. But they found no children\nthere either. However, the Dhobee's mischievous little daughter had gone with\nher father to witness the work of destruction, and as they were looking on,\nshe said, 'Father, do look at all those funny little trees; I never remember\nnoticing them here before.' And being very inquisitive, she started off to\nhave a nearer look at them. There in a circle grew the hundred little mango\ntrees, and in the centre of all the little rose-bush, bearing the red and\nwhite roses.\n\nThe girl brushed by the mango trees, who uttered no words, and running up to\nthe rose-bush began gathering some of the flowers. At this the rose-bush\ntrembled very much, and sighed and said, 'I am a little girl as well as you;\nhow can you be so cruel? You are breaking all my ribs.' Then the child ran\nback to her father and said, 'Come and listen to what the rose-bush says.' And\nthe father repeated the news to the twelve Ranees, who ordered that a great\nfire should be made, and the hundred and one little trees burnt in it root and\nbranch, till not a stick remained.\n\nThe fire was made, and the hundred and one little trees were dug up, and just\ngoing to be thrown into it, when Gunputti, taking pity on them, caused a\ntremendous storm to come on, which put out the fire, and flooded the country\nand swept the hundred and one trees into the river, where they were carried\ndown a long, long way by the torrent, until at last the children were landed,\nrestored to their own shapes, on the river-bank, in the midst of a wild\njungle, very far from any human habitation.\n\nHere these children lived for ten years, happy in their mutual love and\naffection. Generally every day fifty of the boys would go out to collect roots\nand berries for their food, leaving fifty at home to take care of their little\nsister: but sometimes they put her in some safe place, and all would go out\ntogether for the day; nor were they ever molested in their excursions by bear,\npanther, snake, scorpion, or other noxious creature. One day all the brothers\nput their little sister safely up in a fine shady tree, and went out together\nto hunt. After rambling on for some time, they came to the hut of a savage\nRakshas, who in the disguise of an old woman had lived for many years in the\njungle. The Rakshas, angry at this invasion of her domain, no sooner saw them\nthan she changed them all into crows. Night came on, and their little sister\nwas anxiously awaiting her brothers' return, when on a sudden she heard a loud\nwhirring sound in the air, and round the tree flocked a hundred black crows,\ncawing and offering her berries, and roots which they had dug up with their\nsharp bills. Then the little sister guessed too truly what must have happened,\n--that some malignant spirit had metamorphosed her brothers into this hideous\nshape; and at the sad sight she began to cry.\n\nTime wore on; every morning the crows flew away to collect food for her and\nfor themselves, and every evening they returned to roost in the branches of\nthe high tree where she sat the live-long day, crying as if her heart would\nbreak.\n\nAt last so many bitter tears had she shed, that they made a little stream\nwhich flowed from the foot of the tree right down through the jungle.\n\nSome months after this, one fine day a young Rajah from a neighbouring country\nhappened to be hunting in this very jungle; but he had not been very\nsuccessful. Towards the close of the day he found himself faint and weary,\nhaving missed his way and lost his comrades, without companions save his dogs,\nwho, being thirsty, ran hurriedly hither and thither in search of water. After\nsome time, they saw in the distance what looked like a clear stream; the dogs\nrushed there, and the tired Prince, following them, flung himself down on the\ngrass by the water's brink, thinking to sleep there for the night; and with\nhis hands under his head, stared up into the leafy branches of the tree above\nhim. Great was his astonishment to see high up among the boughs an immense\nnumber of crows, and above them all a most lovely young girl, who was feeding\nthem with berries and wild fruits. Quick as thought he climbed the tree, and\nbringing her carefully and gently down, seated her on the grass beside him,\nsaying, 'Tell me, pretty lady, who you are, and how you come to be living in\nthis dreary place.' In reply she told him all her adventures, except that she\ndid not say the hundred crows were her hundred brothers. Then the Rajah said,\n'Do not cry any more, fair Princess; you shall come home with me and be my\nRanee, and my father and mother shall be yours.' At this she smiled and dried\nher eyes, but quickly added, 'You will let me take these crows with me, will\nyou not? for I love them dearly, and I cannot go away unless they may come\ntoo.' 'To be sure,' he answered. 'You may bring all the animals in the jungle\nwith you, if you like, so you will only come.'\n\nSo he took her home to his father's house, and the old Rajah and Ranee\nwondered much at this jungle Lady, when they saw her rare beauty, her modest\ngentle ways, and her queenly grace. Then the young Rajah told them how she was\na persecuted Princess, and asked their leave to marry her; and because her\nloving goodness had won all hearts, they gave their consent as joyfully as if\nshe had been daughter of the greatest of Rajahs, and brought with her a\nsplendid dower; and they called her Draupadi Bai.  4\n\nDraupadi had some beautiful trees planted in front of her palace, in which the\ncrows, her brothers, used to live, and she daily with her own hands boiled a\nquantity of rice, which she would scatter for them to eat as they flew down to\nher call Now some time after this, Draupadi Bai had a son, who was called\nRamchundra. He was a very good boy, and his mother Draupadi Bai used to take\nhim to school every morning, and go and fetch him home in the evening. But one\nday, when Ramchundra was about fourteen years old, it happened that Draupadi\nBai did not go to fetch him home from school as she was wont; and on his\nreturn, he found her sitting under the trees in front of her palace, stroking\nthe glossy black crows that flocked around her, and weeping.\n\nThen Ramchundra threw down his bundle of books, and said to his mother,\nputting his elbows on her knees, and looking up in her face, 'Mammy, dear,\ntell me why you are now crying, and what it is that makes you so often sad.'\n'Oh, nothing, nothing,' she answered. 'Yes, dear mother,' said he, 'do tell\nme. Can I help you? If I can, I will.' DraupadI Bai shook her head: 'Alas! no,\nmy son,' she said, 'you are too young to help me; and as for my grief; I have\nnever told it to any one. I cannot tell it to you now.' But Ramchundra\ncontinued begging and praying her to tell him, until at last she did; relating\nto him all her own and his uncles' sad history; and, lastly, how they had been\nchanged by a Rakshas into the black crows he saw around him. Then the boy\nsprang up and said, 'Which way did your brothers take when they met the\nRakshas?' 'How can I tell?' she asked. 'Why,' he answered, 'I thought,\nperhaps, you might remember on which side they returned that first night to\nyou, after being bewitched?' 'Oh,' she said, 'they came towards the tree from\nthat part of the jungle which lies in a straight line behind the palace.'\n'Very well,' cried Ramchundra joyfully; 'I also will go there, and find out\nthis wicked old Rakshas, and learn by what means they may be disenchanted.'\n'No, no, my son,' she answered, 'I cannot let you go: see, I have lost father\nand mother, and these my hundred brothers; and now, if you fall into the\nRakskas' clutches as well as they, and are lost to me, what will life have\nworth living for?' To this he replied, 'Do not fear for me, mother; I will be\nwary and discreet.' And, going to his father, he said, 'Father, it is time I\nshould see something of the world. I beg you to permit me to travel and see\nother lands.' The Rajah answered, 'You shall go. Tell me what attendants you\nwould like to accompany you.' 'Give me,' said Ramchundra, 'a horse to ride,\nand a groom to take care of it.' The Rajab consented, and Ramchundra set off\nriding towards the jungle; but as soon as he got there, he sent his horse back\nby the groom with a message to his parents, and proceeded alone, on foot.\n\nAfter wandering about for some time, he came upon a small hut, in which lay an\nugly old woman fast asleep. She had long claws instead of hands, and her hair\nhung down all around her in a thick black tangle. Ramchundra knew, by the\nwhole appearance of the place, that he must have reached the Rakshas' abode of\nwhich he was in search, so, stealing softly in, he sat down, and began\nshampooing her head. At last the Rakshas woke up. 'You dear little boy,' she\nsaid, 'do not be afraid; I am only a poor old woman, and will not hurt you.\nStay with me, and you shall be my servant.' This she said not from any feeling\nof kindness or pity for Ramchundra, but merely because she thought he might be\nhelpful to her. So the young Rajab remained in her service, determining to\nstay there till he should have learnt from her all that he wished to know.\n\nThus one day he said to her, 'Good mother, what is the use of all those little\njars of water you have arranged round your house?' She answered, 'That water\npossesses certain magical attributes; if any of it is sprinkled on people\nenchanted by me, they instantly resume their former shape.' 'And what,' he\ncontinued, 'is the use of this wand?' 'That,' she replied, 'has many\nsupernatural powers: for instance, by simply uttering your wish, and waving it\nin the air, you can conjure up a mountain, a river, or a forest, in a moment\nof time.'\n\nAnother day Ramchundra said to her, 'Your hair, good mother, is dreadfully\ntangled; pray let me comb it.' 'No,' she said, 'you must not touch my hair: it\nwould be dangerous; for every hair has power to set the jungle on fire.' 'How\nis that?' he asked. She replied, 'The least fragment of my hair thrown in the\ndirection of the jungle would instantly set it in a blaze.' Having learnt all\nthis, one day when it was very hot, and the old Rakshas was drowsy, Ramchundra\nbegged leave to shampoo her head, which speedily sent her to sleep: then,\ngently pulling out two or three of her hairs, he got up, and taking in one\nhand her wand, and in the other two jars of the magic water, he stealthily\nleft the hut; but he had not gone far before she woke up, and, instantly\ndivining what he had done, pursued him with great rapidity. Ramchundra looked\nback, and, perceiving that she was gaining upon him, waved the enchanted wand,\nand created a great river, which suddenly rolled its tumultuous waves between\nthem; but, quick as thought, the Rakshas swam the river.\n\nThen he turned, and waving the wand again, caused a high mountain to rise\nbetween them; but the Rakshas climbed the mountain. Nearer she came, and yet\nnearer; each time he turned to use the wand and put obstacles in her way, the\ndelay gave her a few minutes' advantage, so that he lost almost as much as he\ngained. Then, as a last resource, he scattered the hairs he had stolen to the\nwinds, and, immediately, the jungle on the hillside, through which the Rakshas\nwas coming, was set in a blaze; the fire rose higher and higher, the wicked\nold Rakshas was consumed by the flames, and Ramchundra pursued his journey in\nsafety until he reached his father's palace. DraupadI Bai was overjoyed to see\nher son again, and he led her out into the garden, and scattered the magic\nwater on the hundred black crows, which instantly recovered their human forms,\nand stood up one hundred fine handsome young men.\n\nThen were there rejoicings throughout the country, because the Ranee's\nbrothers had been disenchanted; and the Rajah sent out into all neighbouring\nlands to invite their Rajahs and Ranees to a great feast in honour of his\nbrothers-in-law.\n\nAmong others who came to the feast was the Rajah Draupadf Bai's father, and\nthe twelve wicked Ranees his wives.\n\nWhen they were all assembled, Draupadf arose, and said to him, 'Noble Sir, we\nhad looked to see your wife Guzra Bai with you. Pray you tell us why she has\nnot accompanied you?' The Rajah was much surprised to learn that Draupadi Bai\nknew anything about Guzra Bai, and he said, 'Do not speak of her, she is a\nwicked woman; it is fit that she should end her days in prison.' But Draupadi\nBai and her husband, and her hundred brothers, rejoined, 'Send home instantly,\nO Rajah, and fetch hither that much injured lady, which, if you refuse to do,\nyour wives shall be imprisoned, and you yourself ignominiously expelled this\nkingdom.'\n\nThe Rajah could not guess the meaning of this, and thought they merely wished\nto pick a quarrel with him; but not much caring whether Guzra Bai came or not,\nhe sent for her as was desired. When she arrived, her daughter Draupadf Bai,\nand her hundred sons, with Draupadi Bai's husband and the young Ramchundra,\nwent out to the gate to meet her, and conducted her into the palace with all\nhonour. Then, standing around her, they turned to the Rajah her husband, and\nrelated to him the story of their lives; how that they were his children, and\nGuzra Bai their mother; how she had been cruelly calumniated by the twelve\nwicked Ranees, and they in constant peril of their lives; but having\nmiraculously escaped many terrible dangers, still lived to pay him duteous\nservice, and to cheer and support his old age.\n\nAt this news the whole company was very much astonished. The Rajah, overjoyed,\nembraced his wife Guzra Bai, and it was agreed that she and their hundred sons\nshould return with him to his own land, which accordingly was done. Ramchundra\nlived very happily with his father and mother to the day of their death, when\nhe ascended the throne, and became a very popular Rajah; and the twelve wicked\nold Ranees, who had conspired against Guzra Bai and her children, were, by\norder of the Rajah, burnt to death. Thus truth triumphed in the end; but so\nunequally is human justice meted out, that the old nurse, who worked their\nevil will, and was in fact the most guilty wretch of all, is said to have\nlived unpunished, to have died in the bosom of her family, and to have had as\nbig a funeral pile as any virtuous Hindu.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1](odd08.htm#fr_32) Solanum Melongena; the egg-shaped fruit of which is a\nfavourite vegetable all over India.\n\n[2](odd08.htm#fr_33) Flower Girl.\n\n[3](odd08.htm#fr_34) A species of large rat.\n\n[4](odd08.htm#fr_35) Doubtless after the beautiful Princess Draupadi, daughter\nof the Rajah of Panchala, and a famous character in the great Hindu Epic, the\nMaha Bharata.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V.
