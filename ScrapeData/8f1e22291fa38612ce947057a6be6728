I will explain to you accurately the quality of passion.\nLearn, O noble ones! the action of the quality of passion. Injuring (others),\nbeauty 2, toil, pleasure and pain, cold and heat, power 2, war, peace,\nargument, repining 3, endurance, strength, valour, frenzy, wrath, exercise and\nquarrel too, vindictiveness, desire, backbiting, battle, the thought (that\nthis or that is) mine, preservation 4, slaughter, bonds, affliction, buying\nand selling, touching 5 other people's weak points, by cutting, breaking,\npiercing; fierceness and cruelty, vilifying, pointing out others' weaknesses,\nthinking of (this) world, harbouring evil thoughts, animosity, abuse\n\np. 324\n\nuttering falsehoods, bad 1 gifts, doubt, boasting, censure, praise, laudation\n2, prowess, defiance, attendance. (on another), obedience 3, service,,\nharbouring desire, management 4, policy, heedlessness, contumely, belongings\n5, and the various decorations which prevail in this world, for men, for\nwomen, for living creatures., for articles, and for houses, vexation, and also\nwant of faith, vows and regulation 6, and actions with expectations, and the\nvarious acts of public charity 7 the ceremony of Svaha, the ceremony of\nSvadha, the ceremony of Vashat 8, salutation, both officiating at sacrifices\nand imparting instruction, and also sacrificing and study, gifts and\nacceptance of gifts, expiations, auspicious rites, the wish 'this may be mine\nand that may be mine,' affection generated by the qualities 9, treachery and\nlikewise deception, disrespect and respect, theft, slaughter, disgust, vexing\n(oneself), wakefulness, ostentation, haughtiness, and attachment also,\ndevotion, pleasure and delight, gambling, common scandal, association with\nwomen, devotion\n\np. 325\n\nto dancing, and instrumental or vocal music, all these qualities, O Brahma _n_\nas! are described as passionate. The men who meditate on past, present, and\nfuture entities in this world [1](sbe0850.htm#fn_1571), who are always devoted\nto the triad--piety, wealth, and lust also [2](sbe0850.htm#fn_1572)\\--who\nacting under (the impulse of) desires exult or. the success of all their\ndesires, these men, who are enveloped by passion, have (their) currents\ndownwards [3](sbe0850.htm#fn_1573). Born again and again in this world, they\nrejoice [4](sbe0850.htm#fn_1574), and wish for the fruit appertaining to the\nlife after death [5](sbe0850.htm#fn_1575) and that appertaining to this world\nalso. They give and receive, and make Tarpa _n_ a [6](sbe0850.htm#fn_1576),\nand also sacrifice. The qualities of passion have been described to you in\nmany ways, and the action of the quality has also been stated accurately. The\nman who always understands these qualities, gets rid of all passionate\nqualities.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[323:1](sbe0848.htm#fr_1563) Generally and specifically, says Ar _g_ una Mi\n_s_ ra.\n\n[323:2](sbe0849.htm#fr_1565) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra says these mean pride of\nbeauty and pride of power respectively. Cf. as to this list generally, Maitri,\npp. 50, 51.\n\n[323:3](sbe0849.htm#fr_1566) Cf. Sanatsu _g_ ata, [p.\n168](sbe0824.htm#page_168).\n\n[323:4](sbe0849.htm#fr_1567) I presume this means solicitude for preserving\nwhat one has got. Cf. Gita, [p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48).\n\n[323:5](sbe0849.htm#fr_1568) Literally, piercing. 'Cutting, breaking,\npiercing,' further on, seem to indicate the greater or less offensiveness of\nthe operation of 'touching others' weak points.'\n\n[324:1](sbe0849.htm#fr_1569) I. e. to undeserving persons, Ar _g_ una Mi _s_\nra. Probably it includes the other defects also pointed out at Gita, [p.\n120](sbe0819.htm#page_120). As to doubt, see Gita, [p.\n63](sbe0806.htm#page_63).\n\n[324:2](sbe0849.htm#fr_1570) The one is attributing merits which do not exist,\nthe other is merely parading merits which do exist.\n\n[324:3](sbe0849.htm#fr_1571) Ar _g_ una Mi _s_ ra takes this literally to mean\n'wish to hear.'\n\n[324:4](sbe0849.htm#fr_1572) Cleverness in worldly affairs, Nilaka _nth_ a.\n\n[324:5](sbe0849.htm#fr_1573) Cf. Gita, passim, and see also Yoga-sutras II,\n30, and commentary (pp. 127-129, Calc. ed.)\n\n[324:6](sbe0849.htm#fr_1574) Fasts and other observances for special benefits.\n\n[324:7](sbe0849.htm#fr_1575) E.g. digging tanks and wells, &c.\n\n[324:8](sbe0849.htm#fr_1576) Vashat and Svaha indicate offerings to gods,\nSvadha to the manes. See B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka, p. 982, and Ma _nd_ ukya (Gau\n_d_ apada Karika), p. 443, and commentaries there.\n\n[324:9](sbe0849.htm#fr_1577) I presume this means attachment to the operations\nof the qualities. Cf. Gita, [p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48). As to the wish just\nbefore, see Gita, pp. [115](sbe0818.htm#page_115),\n[110](sbe0816.htm#page_110).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter XXIII](sbe0850.htm)\n\n"
