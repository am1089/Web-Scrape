An abridged form of those volumes,2 which subsequently  p.\niv appeared, contains nothing of the Sanskrit original but the Aphorisms.\n\n   While, in the following pages, all the corrections obtainable from the\nabridgment have been turned to account, an immense number of improved readings\nhave been taken from another source. Three several times I carefully read Dr.\nBallantyne\'s translation in as many different copies of it; entering\nsuggestions, in the second copy, without reference to those which had been\nentered in the first, and similarly making independent suggestions in my third\ncopy. All these1 were, on various occasions, submitted to Dr. Ballantyne; and\nsuch of them as did not meet his approval were crossed through. The residue,\nmany more than a thousand, have been embodied  p. v in the ensuing sheets, but\nare not indicated,1 as successively introduced. The renderings proposed in the\nfootnotes are, for the most part, from among those which have recently\noccurred to me as eligible.\n\n   That Dr. Ballantyne had any thought of reissuing, in whatever form, the\nvolumes mentioned at the beginning of this Advertisement, I was unaware, till\nsome years after he had made over the abridgment of them to Professor Cowell,\nfor publication.2 Otherwise, I should have placed at his disposal the\nmaterials towards improvement of his second edition, which, at the cost of no\nslight drudgery, are here made available.\n\n   The Sankhya Aphorisms, in all the known commentaries on them, are exhibited\nword for word. The variants, now given, of the Aphorisms, afforded by\naccessible productions of that character, have been drawn from the works, of\nwhich only one has yet been printed, about to be specified:3\n\n   I. The _S ankhya-pravachana-bhashya_, by Vijnana Bhikshu. Revelant\nparticulars I have given elsewhere. My oldest MS. of it was transcribed in\n1654.\n\np. vi\n\n   II. The _K apila-sankhya-pravachana-sutra-v\xe1\xb9\x9bitti_, by Aniruddha. Of this I\nhave consulted, besides a MS. copied in 1818, formerly the property of Dr.\nBallantyne, one which I procured to be copied, in 1855, from an old MS.\nwithout date.\n\n   III. The _Laghhu-s ankhya-sutra-v\xe1\xb9\x9bitti_, by Nagesa. Of this I have two\nMSS., both undated. One of them is entire; but the other is defective by the\nthree first Books.\n\n   IV. The _S ankhya-pravachana-sutra-v\xe1\xb9\x9bitti-sara_, by Vedanti Mahadeva. Here,\nagain, only one of two MSS. which I possess is complete. The other, which\nbreaks off in the midst of the comment on Book II., Aph. 15, is, in places,\nfreely intetpolated from No. I. Neither of them has a date.\n\n   Nearly all my longer annotations, and some of the shorter, were\nscrutinized, while in the rough, by the learned Professor Cowell, but for\nwhose searching criticisms, which cannot be valued too highly, they would, in\nseveral instances, have been far less accurate than they now are.\n\nF.

The proof-sheets of only 32 pages of the whole,\nfrom the beginning, were read by Dr. Ballantyne; the rest, by Professor\nCowell.\n\nThe title of the abridged form runs: "The Sankhya Aphorisms of Kapila, with\nExtracts from Vijnana Bhiks[h]u\'s Commentary," &c. But this is a\nmisrepresentation, as regards Book I., which takes up 63 pages out of the\ntotal of 175. The expository matter in that Book is derived, very largely,\nfrom other commentators than Vijnana.  p. iv Vedanti Mahadeva mainly supplies\nit at the outset, and, towards the end, well nigh exclusively, Aniruddha. Some\nshare of it, however, will not be traced; it having been furnished by one of\nDr. Ballantyne\'s pandits, whom I have repeatedly seen in the very act, as by\nhis own acknowledgment, of preparing his elucidations.\n\n1 Many of them, especially in Books II.-VI., rest on readings of the original\npreferable to those which had been accepted.\n\nThough not fully published till 1856, my edition of the _S ankkya-pravachana-\nbhashya_, its preface alone excepted, was in print as early as 1853; and Dr.\nBallantyne had a copy of it. A few arbitrarily chosen words apart, his text,\nafter Book I., is borrowed from it throughout, but with no mention of the\nfact. My advice was unheeded, that he should profit by the copious emendations\nwhich I had amassed and digested from better manuscripts than those to which I\nat first had access. Greatly to his disservice, he would not be induced even\nto look at them. It faring the same with my typographical corrections, he has,\nhere and there, reproduced errors, more or less gross, which might easily have\nbeen avoided. See, for specimens. pp. 197, 288, 357, 373, 374, 381, 390.\n\np. v\n\n1 Nor has attention been topically directed to sundry blemishes of idiom which\nhave been removed; as, for example, by the substitution of \'unless\' for\n\'without,\' of \'in time\' for \'through time,\' of \'presently\' for \'just,\' and of\n\'between the two\' for \'between both.\'\n\n2 "At the time of his departure from India, in 1860, Dr. Ballantyne left with\nme the MS. of his revised translation of the Sankhya Aphorisms," "Notice," in\nthe Bibliotheca Indica, New Series, No, 81.\n\n3 For details respecting these commentaries and their authors, see my\n_Contribution towards an Index to the Bibliography of the Indian Philosophical\nSystems_ , or my Preface to the _S ankhya-sara_.\n\np. vi\n\n1 I once had a second copy of this very rare work, bearing no date, but most\nvenerable in appearance. Like many of my manuscript treasures, it was lent,\nand never found its way back to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
