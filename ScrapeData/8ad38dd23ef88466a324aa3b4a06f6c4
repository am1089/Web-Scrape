Vyasa said :-- O King Janamejaya! The Ratnagriha, above mentioned, is\nthe Central, the Chief and the Crowning Place of Mula Prakriti. [The nine\njewels are :-- (1) Mukta, (2) Ma _n_ ikya, (3) Vaidurya, (4) Gomeda, (5)\nVajra, (6) Vidruma, (7) Padmaraga, (8) Marakata, and (9) Nila.] This is\nsituated in the centre of all the enclosures. Within this there are the four\nMa _nd_ apas, i.e., halls built of one thousand (i.e., innumerable) pillars.\nThese are the S\xc2\x92ringara Ma _nd_ apa, Mukti Ma _nd_ apa, J\xc3\xb1ana Ma _nd_ apa and\nEkanta Ma _nd_ apa; on the top there are canopies of various colours; within\nare many scented articles scented by the Dhupas, etc. The brilliance of each\nof these is like that of one Ko _t_ i Suns. On all sides of these four Ma _nd_\napas there are nice groups of gardens of Kas\xc2\x92mira, Mallika, and Ku _nd_ a\nflowers. Various scents, and scented articles, for example, of musk, etc., are\nfully arranged in due order. There is a very big lotus tank here; the steps\nleading to it are built of jewels. Its water is nectar, on it are innumerable\nfull-blown lotuses and the bees are humming always over them. Many birds,\nswans, Kara _nd_ avas, etc., are swimming to and fro. The sweet scents of\nlotuses are playing all round. In fact, the whole Ma _n_ idvipa is perfumed\nwith various scented things. Within the S\xc2\x92ringara Ma _nd_ apa, the Devi\nBhagavati is situated in the centre on an \xc3\x82sana (seat) and She hears the songs\nsung in tune by the other Devis along with the other Devas. Similarly sitting\non the Mukti Ma _nd_ apa, She frees the Jivas from the bondages of the world.\nSitting on the J\xc3\xb1ana Ma _nd_ apa, She gives instructions on J\xc3\xb1ana, and sitting\non the fourth Ekanta Ma _nd_ apa, She consults with Her ministers, the Sakhis,\nAnanga Kusuma, etc., on the creation, preservation, etc., of the universe. O\nKing! Now I shall describe about the main, Khas, room of S\xc2\x92ri Devi. Listen.\nThe Khas Mahal palace of the Devi Bhagavati is named S\xc2\x92ri Chintama _n_ i\nGriha. Within this is placed the raised\n\n\n\np. 1186\n\n\n\nplatform, the dais and sofa whereon the Devi taketh Her honourable seat. The\nten S\xc2\x92akti-tattvas form the staircases. The four legs are (1) Brahma, (2) Vi\n_sn_ u, (3) Rudra, and (4) Mahes\xc2\x92vara. Sadas\xc2\x92iva forms the upper covering\nplank. Over this S\xc2\x92ri Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vara Maha Deva or the Supreme Architect of the\nUniverse is reigning. Now hear something about this Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vara. Before\ncreation while intending to sport, the Devi Bhagavati divided Her Body into\ntwo parts and from the right part created Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vara. He has five faces and\neach face has three eyes. He has four hands and He is holding in each hand\nspeer, signs indicating do not fear, axe, and signs granting boons. He looks\nsixteen years old. The lustre of of His Body is more beautiful then Ko _t_ i\nKandarpas and more fiery than thousand Suns; and at the same time cool like Ko\n_t_ i Suns. His colour is crystal white, and on His left lap S\xc2\x92ri\nBhuvanes\xc2\x92vari Devi is always sitting.\n\n\n\n18-29. On the hip of S\xc2\x92ri Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, is shining the girdle with small\ntinkling bells, built of various jewels; the ornaments on the arms are made of\nburnished gold studded with Vaiduryama _n_ is; the Ta _t_ anka ornaments on\nHer ears are very beautiful like S\xc2\x92richakra and they enhance very much the\nbeauty of Her lotus face. The beauty of Her forehead vies with, or defies the\nMoon of the eighth bright lunar day. Her lips challenge the fully ripened\nBimba fruits. Her face is shining with the Tilaka mark made of musk and\nsaffron. The divine crown on Her head is beautified with the Sun and Moon made\nof jewels; the nose ornaments are like the star Venus and built of transparent\ngems, looking exceedingly beautiful and shedding charming lustre all around.\nThe neck is decorated with necklaces built of gems and jewels. Her breasts are\nnicely decorated with camphor and saffron. Her neck is shining like a\nconchshell decorated with artistic designs. Her teeth look like fully ripe\npomegranate fruits. On Her head is shining the jewel crown. Her lotus face is\nbeautified with alaka as if these are mad bees. Her navel is beautiful like\nthe whirls in the river Bhagirathi; Her fingers are decorated with jewel\nrings; She has three eyes like lotus leaves; the lustre of Her body is bright\nlike Padmaragama _n_ i cut and carved and sharpened on stone. The bracelets\nare adorned with jewel tinkling bells; Her neck ornaments and medals are\nstudded with gems and jewels. Her hands are resplendent with the lustre of the\njewels on the fingers; the braid of hair on Her head is wreathed with a\ngarland of Mallika flowers; Her bodice (short jacket) is studded with various\njewels.\n\n\n\n30-45. O King! S\xc2\x92ri Devi is slightly bent down with the weight of Her very\nhigh hard breasts. She has four hands and She is holding noose, goad and signs\ngranting boons and \xc2\x93do not fear.\xc2\x94 The all beautiful all merciful Devi is full\nof love gestures and beauties. Her voice is sweeter than that of lute; the\nlustre of Her body is like Ko _t_ is and Ko _t_ is of Suns and\n\n\n\np. 1187\n\n\n\nMoons if they rise simultaneously on the sky. The Sakhis, attendants, the\nDevas and the Devis surround Her on all sides. Ichcha S\xc2\x92akti, J\xc3\xb1ana S\xc2\x92akti,\nand Kriya S\xc2\x92akti all are present always before the Devi. Lajja, Tu _st_ i, Pu\n_st_ i, Kirti, Kanti, K _s_ ama, Daya, Buddhi, Medha, Smriti, and Lak _s_ mi\nare always seen here incarnate in their due Forms. The nine Pi _t_ ha S\xc2\x92aktis,\nJaya, Vijaya, Ajita, Aparajita, Nitya, Vilasini, Dogdhri, Aghora, and Mangala\nreside here always and are in the service of the Devi Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vari. On the\nside of the Devi are the two oceans of treasures; from these streams of\nNavaratna, gold, and seven Dhatus (elements) go out and assume the forms of\nrivers and fall into the ocean Sudha Sindhu. Because such a Devi\nBhuvanes\xc2\x92vari, resplendent with all powers and prosperities, sits on the left\nlap of Bhuvanes\xc2\x92vara, that He has, no doubt acquired His omnipotence. O King!\nNow I will describe the dimensions of the Chintama _n_ i Griha. Listen. It is\none thousand Yojanas wide; its centre is very big; the rooms situated further\nand further are twice those preceding them. It lies in Antarik _s_ a (the\nintervening space) without any support. At the times of dissolution and\ncreation it contracts and expands like a cloth. The lustre of this Chintama\n_n_ i Griha is comparatively far more bright and beautiful than that of other\nenclosure walls. S\xc2\x92ri Devi Bhagavati dwells always in this place. O King! All\nthe great Bhaktas of the Devi in every Brahma _nd_ a, in the Devaloka, in\nNagaloka, in the world of men or in any other loka, all those that were\nengaged in the meditation of the Devi in the sacred places of the Devi and\ndied there, they all come here and reside with the Devi in great joy and\nfestivity.\n\n\n\n46-59. On all sides rivers are flowing; some of ghee, some of milk, curd,\nhoney, nectar, pomegranate juice, jambu juice, and some of mango juice,\nsugarcane juices are flowing on all sides. The trees here yield fruits\naccording to one\xc2\x92s desires and the wells and tanks yield water also as people\ndesire. Never is there any want felt here of anything. Never are seen here\ndiseases, sorrow, old age, decrepitude, anxiety, anger, jealousy, and envy and\nother lower ideas. All the inhabitants of this place are full of youth and\nlook like one thousand Suns. All enjoy with their wives and they worship S\xc2\x92ri\nBhuvanes\xc2\x92vari. Some have attained Salokya, some Samipya, some Sarupya and some\nhave attained Sar _st_ i and pass their days in highest comfort. The Devas\nthat are in every Brahma _nd_ a all live here and worship S\xc2\x92ri Devi. The seven\nKo _t_ i Maha Mantras and Maha Vidyas here assume forms and worship the Maha\nMaya S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavati, Who is of the nature of Brahma. O King! Thus I have\ndescribed to you all about this Ma _n_ idvipa. The lustre of Sun, Moon and Ko\n_t_ is and Ko _t_ is of lightnings cannot be one Ko _t_ ieth of one Ko _t_ i\npart of Its lustre. At some places the lustre is like Vidrumama _n_ i; some\nplaces as are illumined like the lustre of Marakata Ma _n_ i; some, like Surya\nKanta ma _n_ i and some\n\n\n\np. 1188\n\n\n\nplaces are rendered brilliant like Ko _t_ is and Ko _t_ is of lightnings. The\nlight at some places is like Sindura; at some places like Indranilama _n_ i;\nat some places, like Ma _n_ ikya, and at some places like diamond. Some places\nare blazing like the conflagration of fire; and some places look like molten\ngold; some places seem filled with the lustre of Chandrakantama _n_ i, and\nsome places look brilliant like Suryakantama _n_ i.\n\n\n\n60-73. The mountains here are all built of gems and jewels; the entrance gates\nand enclosures are built of gems and jewels; the trees and their leaves all\nare of gems; in fact all that exist here are all of gems and jewels. At some\nplaces numbers of peacocks are dancing; at some places cuckoos are captivating\nthe minds of persons by cooing in the fifth tune and at others doves and\npigeons and parrots are making sweet cackling sounds. Lakhs and lakhs of tanks\nare there with their pure crystal-like waters. The Red lotuses have blown\nfully and enhanced the beauty of the place. The captivating scents of these\nlotuses extend to a distance one hundred Yojanas all round and gladden the\nminds of people. The leaves are rustling with gentle breeze. The whole sky\noverhead is radiant with the lustre of Chintama _n_ i gems and jewels. All the\nsides are illuminated with the brilliancy of the gems and jewels. O King!\nThese jewels act like lamps. And the sweet scented trees emit their flagrance\nand it is transmitted by breeze all around. Thus these trees serve the purpose\nof dhup (scent). The rays of these gems pierce through the openings of the\njewel screens on the houses and fall on the mirrors inside, thus causing a\nnice brilliant appearance that captivates the mind and causes confusion. O\nKing! And what shall I say of this place, more than this, that all the powers,\nand wealth, all the love sentiments, all the dress suited to amorous\ninterviews, all the splendours, fire, energy, beauty and brilliance, the\nomniscience, the indomitable strength, all the excellent qualities and all\nmercy and kindness are present here! The All Comprehending Bliss and the\nBrahmana _nd_ a can always be witnessed here! O King! Thus I have described to\nyou about the Ma _n_ idvipa, the most exalted place of the Devi Bhagavati. At\nHer remembrance all the sins are instantly destroyed. The more so, if a man\nremembers the Devi and about this place at the time of death, He surely goes\nthere. O King! He who daily reads the five Chapters, i.e., from the eighth to\nthis twelfth chapter, is surely untouched by any obstacles due to the Bhutas,\nPretas and Pis\xc2\x92achas. Especially the recitation of this at the time of\nbuilding a new house and at the time of Vastuyaga ensures all good and\nauspiciousness.\n\n\n\np. 1189\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twelfth Chapter of the Twelfth Book on the description of Ma _n_\ni Dvipa in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 13](bk12ch13.htm)\n\n'
