Now Pra _g_ apati (the lord of creatures), having created living\nbeings, felt himself as it were exhausted 4. The creatures turned away from\nhim; the creatures 5 did not abide with him for his joy and food.\n\n3:9:1:22\\. He thought within him, 'I have exhausted\n\np. 218\n\nmyself, and the object for which 1 I have created has not been accomplished:\nmy creatures have turned away from me, the creatures have not abode with me\nfor my joy and food.'\n\n3:9:1:33\\. Pra _g_ apati thought within him, 'How can I again strengthen\nmyself: the creatures might then return to me; the creatures might abide with\nme for my joy and food!'\n\n3:9:1:44\\. He went on praising and toiling, desirous of creatures (or\nprogeny). He beheld that set of eleven (victims). By offering therewith Pra\n_g_ apati again strengthened himself; the creatures returned to him, his\ncreatures abode for his joy and food. By offering he truly became better.\n\n3:9:1:55\\. Therefore, then, let him offer with the set of eleven (victims),\nfor thus he truly strengthens himself by offspring and cattle the creatures\nturn unto him, the creatures abide with him for his joy and food;--he truly\nbecomes better by offering: therefore, then, let him offer with the set of\neleven (victims).\n\n3:9:1:66\\. In the first place he seizes 2 a victim for Agni. For Agni is the\nhead, the progenitor of the gods, he is the lord of creatures: and thereby the\nsacrificer truly becomes Agni's own.\n\n3:9:1:77\\. Then one for Sarasvati. For Sarasvati is speech: by speech Pra _g_\napati then again strengthened himself; speech turned unto him, speech he made\nsubject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by speech, and\nspeech turns unto him, and he makes speech subject to himself.\n\n3:9:1:88\\. Then one for Soma. For Soma is food: by\n\np. 219\n\nfood Pra _g_ apati then again strengthened himself; food turned unto him, and\nhe made food subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by\nfood; food turns unto him, and he makes food subject to himself.\n\n3:9:1:99\\. And as to why it comes after that for Sarasvati,--Sarasvati is\nspeech, and Soma is food: he who is incomplete by (having only) speech, now\nbecomes indeed an eater of food.\n\n3:9:1:1010\\. Then one for Pushan. For Pushan means cattle; by means of cattle\nPra _g_ apati then again strengthened himself; cattle turned unto him, he made\ncattle subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by means of\ncattle; the cattle turn unto him, and he makes the cattle subject to himself.\n\n3:9:1:1111\\. Then one for B _ri_ haspati. For B _ri_ haspati means the\npriesthood (brahman); by means of the priesthood Pra _g_ apati then again\nstrengthened himself; the priesthood turned unto him, he made the priesthood\nsubject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by means of the\nBrahman; the priesthood turns unto him, he makes the priesthood subject to\nhimself.\n\n3:9:1:1212\\. And as to why it comes after that for Pushan,--Pushan means\ncattle, and B _ri_ haspati the priesthood; hence the Brahma _n_ a (priest) has\nthe most power over beasts, because they are placed in front (are protected)\nby him 1, because they are placed at the head (or in his mouth); therefore\n\np. 220\n\nhaving given all that, he walks clad in sheepskin 1.\n\n3:9:1:1313\\. Then one for the Vi _s_ ve deva _h_. For the All-gods mean\neverything (or the All); with everything Pra _g_ apati then again strengthened\nhimself; everything turned unto him, and he made everything subject to him.\nAnd so does this one now become strong by everything; everything turns to him,\nand he makes everything subject to himself.\n\n3:9:1:1414\\. And as to why it comes after that for B _ri_ haspati,--B _ri_\nhaspati means the priesthood, and the All-gods this All; he then makes the\npriesthood the head of this All; wherefore the Brahman is the head of this\nAll.\n\n3:9:1:1515\\. Then one for Indra. For Indra means power (indriya) and vigour;\nby power and vigour Pra _g_ apati then again strengthened himself; power and\nvigour turned unto him, and he made power and vigour subject to himself. And\nso does this one now become strong by means of power and vigour; power and\nvigour turn to him, and he makes power and vigour subject to himself.\n\n3:9:1:1616\\. And as to why it comes after that for the All-gods,--Indra is the\nnobility, and the All-gods are the clans (people); he thus places the food\nbefore him.\n\n3:9:1:1717\\. Then one for the Maruts. For the Maruts mean the clans, and a\nclan means abundance; with abundance Pra _g_ apati then again strengthened\nhimself; abundance turned unto him, and he made abundance subject to himself.\nAnd so does this one now become strong by abundance; abundance\n\np. 221\n\nturns unto him, and he makes abundance subject to himself.\n\n3:9:1:1818\\. And as to why it comes after that for Indra,--Indra is the\nnobility, and the All-gods are the clans, and the Maruts are the clans; he\nthus guards the nobility by the clan, and hence the nobility here is on both\nsides guarded by the clan.\n\n3:9:1:1919\\. Then one for Indra and Agni. For Agni means penetrating\nbrilliance, and Indra means power and vigour; with these two energies Pra _g_\napati then again strengthened himself; both energies turned unto him, and he\nmade both energies subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong\nby both these energies; both energies turn unto him, and he makes both\nenergies subject to himself.\n\n3:9:1:2020\\. Then one for Savit _ri_. For Savit _ri_ is the impeller (prasavit\n_ri_ ) of the gods; and so all those wishes become accomplished for him,\nimpelled as they are by Savit _ri_.\n\n3:9:1:2121\\. Then finally he seizes one for Varu _n_ a; thereby he delivers\nhim (the sacrificer) from every noose of Varu _n_ a, from every (guilt)\nagainst Varu _n_ a 1,\n\n3:9:1:2222\\. Hence if there be eleven sacrificial stakes, let him bind Agni's\n(victim) to the one opposite the fire; and let them lead up the others one by\none in the proper order.\n\n3:9:1:2323\\. But if there be eleven victims 2, let them only immolate at the\nstake that for Agni, and after that the others in the proper order.\n\np. 222\n\n3:9:1:2424\\. When they lead them northwards, they lead the one for Agni first,\nand then the others in the proper order.\n\n3:9:1:2525\\. When they throw them down, they throw down first the one for\nAgni, as the southernmost; then the others after leading them round northwards\nin the proper order.\n\n3:9:1:2626\\. When they perform (offerings) with the omenta, they perform first\nwith the omentum of Agni's (victim); then with those of the others in the\nproper order.\n\n3:9:1:2727\\. When they perform with those (chief oblations), they perform\nfirst with that to Agni; then with the others in the proper order.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[217:4](sbe2636.htm#fr_548) Riri _k_ ana _h_ , lit.
