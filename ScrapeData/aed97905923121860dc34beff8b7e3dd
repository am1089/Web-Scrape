There is no restriction (as to the going on the path of the gods) for any\nvidya; nor any contradiction\n\np. 233\n\n(of the general subject-matter), according to scripture and inference (i.e. Sm\n_ri_ ti).\n\nWe have shown that the going on the path of the gods is valid only for the\nvidyas of the qualified Brahman, not for the knowledge of the highest Brahman\nwhich is destitute of all qualities.--Now we observe that the going on the\npath of the gods is mentioned only in some of the qualified vidyas such as the\nparya\xe1\xb9\x85ka-vidya, the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ agni-vidya, the upako _s_ ala-vidya, the\ndahara-vidya; while it is not mentioned in others, such as the madhu-vidya,\nthe sa _n_ _d_ ilya-vidya, the sho _d_ a _s_ akala-vidya, the vai _s_ vanara-\nvidya.--The doubt then arises whether the going on the path of the gods is to\nbe connected with those vidyas only in which it is actually mentioned or\ngenerally with all vidyas of that kind.\n\nThe purvapakshin maintains the former view; for, he says, the limitative force\nof the general subject-matter of each particular section compels us to connect\nthe going on the path of the gods with those vidyas only which actually\nmention it. If we transferred it to other vidyas also, the authoritativeness\nof scripture would suffer; for then anything might be the sense of anything.\nMoreover, the details about the path of the gods beginning with light and so\non are given equally in the upako _s_ ala-vidya and the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ agni-vidya,\nwhich would be a useless repetition if as a matter of course the going on the\npath of the gods were connected with all vidyas.\n\nTo this we make the following reply. The going on the path of the gods is not\nto be restricted but to be connected equally with all those qualified vidyas\nwhich have exaltation (abhyudaya) for their result. The objection above raised\nby the purvapakshin that thereby we contradict the general subject-matter, we\nrefute by appealing to scripture and Sm _ri_ ti. Scripture in the first place\ndeclares that not only those 'who know this,' i.e. the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ agni-vidya (\n_Kh_. Up. V, 10, 1), proceed on the path of the gods, but also those who\nunderstand other vidyas, 'and also those who in the forest follow faith and\nausterities.'--But how do we know that the latter passage refers to those who\nare conversant with other\n\np. 234\n\nvidyas? The text certainly speaks of those only who are intent on faith and\nausterities!--Not by faith and austerities alone, we reply, unaided by\nknowledge, can that path be attained; for another scriptural passage says,\n'Through knowledge they mount to that place from which all wishes have passed\naway; those who are skilled in works only do not go there, nor penitents\ndevoid of knowledge' ( _S_ at. Bra. X,5, 4,16). We therefore conclude that\nfaith and austerities denote at the same time other vidyas.--The Va _g_\nasaneyins again read in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ agni-vidya, 'Those who thus know this\nand those who in the forest worship faith and the True.' The latter part of\nthis passage we must explain to mean, 'Those who in the forest with faith\nworship the True, i.e. Brahman;' the term 'the True' being often employed to\ndenote Brahman. And as those who know the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ agni-vidya are in the\nabove passage referred to as 'those who thus know this,' we must understand\nthe clause, 'and those who in the forest,' &c., as referring to men in the\npossession of other vidyas. And, moreover, also the passage, 'Those, however,\nwho know neither of these two paths become worms, birds, and creeping things'\n(VI, 2, 16), which teaches that those who miss the two paths have to go\ndownwards, intimates that those who possess other vidyas have to proceed\neither on the path of the gods or that of the fathers, and as their vidyas are\nas such not different from the pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ agni-vidya, we conclude that they\nproceed on the path of the gods (not on that of the fathers) 1\n\nIn the second place Sm _ri_ ti also confirms the same doctrine, 'These two,\nthe white and the black path, are known as the eternal paths of the world; on\nthe one man goes not to return, on the other he again returns' (Bha. Gi. VIII,\n26).\n\nWith regard, finally, to the circumstance that the details about the path of\nthe gods are given in the Upako _s_ ala-vidya\n\np. 235\n\nas well as the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ agni-vidya, we remark that the repetition is meant\nto assist reflection.\n\nFor all these reasons the going on the path of the gods is not limited to\nthose vidyas in which it is actually mentioned.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[234:1](sbe38174.htm#fr_150) Ita _s_ _k_ a vidyantara _s_ ilina _m_ gatir iti\nli\xe1\xb9\x85gadar _s_ ana _m_ samu _kh_ inoti atheti, etan iti vidyantarapara g _ri_\nhyante, tathapi katha _m_ devayanayogas tesham ity a _s_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kya yogyatayety aha\ntatrapiti. \xc3\x82n.
