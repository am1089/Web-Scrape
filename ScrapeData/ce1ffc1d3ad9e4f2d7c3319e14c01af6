People say: 'Uktha, uktha,' hymns, hymns! (without knowing what uktha,\nhymn 3, means.) The\n\np. 203\n\nhymn is truly (to be considered as) the earth, for from it all whatsoever\nexists arises.\n\n2\\. The object of its praise is Agni (fire), and the eighty verses (of the\nhymn) are food, for by means of food one obtains everything.\n\n3\\. The hymn is truly the sky, for the birds fly along the sky, and men drive\nfollowing the sky. The object of its praise is Vayu (air), and the eighty\nverses (of the hymn) are food, for by means of food one obtains everything.\n\n4\\. The hymn is truly the heaven, for from its gift (rain) all whatsoever\nexists arises. The object of its praise is \xc3\x82ditya (the sun), and the eighty\nverses are food, for by means of food one obtains everything.\n\n5\\. So much with reference to the gods (mythological); now with reference to\nman (physiological).\n\n6\\. The hymn is truly man. He is great, he is Pra _g_ apati. Let him think, I\nam the hymn.\n\n7\\. The hymn is his mouth, as before in the case of the earth.\n\n8\\. The object of its praise is speech, and the eighty verses (of the hymn)\nare food, for by means of food he obtains everything.\n\n9\\. The hymn is the nostrils, as before in the case of the sky.\n\n10\\. The object of its praise is breath, and the eighty verses (of the hymn)\nare food, for by means of food he obtains everything.\n\n11\\. The slight bent (at the root) of the nose is, as it were, the place of\nthe brilliant (\xc3\x82ditya, the sun).\n\np. 204\n\n12\\. The hymn is the forehead, as before in the case of heaven. The object of\nits praise is the eye, and the eighty verses (of the hymn) are food, for by\nmeans of food he obtains everything.\n\n13\\. The eighty verses (of the hymn) are alike food with reference to the gods\nas well as with reference to man. For all these beings breathe and live by\nmeans of food indeed. By food (given in alms, &c.) he conquers this world, by\nfood (given in sacrifice) he conquers the other. Therefore the eighty verses\n(of the hymn) are alike food, with reference to the gods as well as with\nreference to man.\n\n14\\. All this that is food, and all this that consumes food, is only the\nearth, for from the earth arises all whatever there is.\n\n115\\. And all that goes hence (dies on earth), heaven consumes it all; and all\nthat goes thence (returns from heaven to a new life) the earth consumes it\nall.\n\n16\\. That earth is thus both food and consumer.\n\nHe also (the true worshipper who meditates on himself as being the uktha) is\nboth consumer and consumed (subject and object 1). No one possesses that which\nhe does not eat, or the things which do not eat him 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[202:3](sbe01203.htm#fr_507) The Comm. explains uktha as that from whence the\nfavour of the gods arises, uttish _th_ aty anena devataprasada iti vyutpatte\n_h_. p. 203 The object is now to show that the uktha or hymn used at the\nMahavrata ceremony has a deeper meaning than it seems to have, and that its\nhighest aim is Brahman; not, however, the highest Brahman, but Brahman\nconsidered as life (pra _n_ a).\n\n[204:1](sbe01203.htm#fr_508) As a master who lives by his servants, while his\nservants live by him. Comm.\n\n[204:2](sbe01203.htm#fr_509) I have translated these paragraphs, as much as\npossible, according to the commentator. I doubt whether, either in the\noriginal or in the interpretation of the commentator, they yield any very\ndefinite sense. They are vague speculations, vague, at least, to us, though\nintended by the Brahmans to give a deeper meaning to certain ceremonial\nobservances connected with the Mahavrata. The uktha, or hymn, which is to be\nmeditated on, as connected with the sacrifice, is part of the Mahavrata, an\nimportant ceremony, to be p. 205 performed on the last day but one (the\ntwenty-fourth) of the Gavamayana sacrifice. That sacrifice lasts a whole year,\nand its performance has been fully described in the Brahma _n_ as and \xc3\x82ra _n_\nyakas. But while the ordinary performer of the Mahavrata has simply to recite\nthe uktha or nishkevalya- _s_ astra, consisting of eighty verses (t _ri_ _k_\na) in the Gayatri, B _ri_ hati, and Ush _n_ ih metres, the more advanced\nworshipper (or priest) is to know that this uktha has a deeper meaning, and is\nto meditate on it as being the earth, sky, heaven, also as the human body,\nmouth, nostrils, and forehead. The worshipper is in fact to identify himself\nby meditation with the uktha in all its senses, and thus to become the\nuniversal spirit or Hira _n_ yagarbha. By this process he becomes the consumer\nand consumed, the subject and object, of everything, while another sacrificer,\nnot knowing this, remains in his limited individual sphere, or, as the text\nexpresses it, does not possess what he cannot eat (perceive), or what cannot\neat him (perceive him). The last sentence is explained differently by the\ncommentator, but in connexion with the whole passage it seems to me to become\nmore intelligible, if interpreted as I have proposed to interpret it.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 1, 3](sbe01204.htm)\n\n"
