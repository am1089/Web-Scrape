THE LION AND THE CRANE.\n\n_\n\nSource.--_ V. __ Fausboll, _Five Jatakas,_ Copenhagen, 1861, pp. 35--8, text\nand translation of the _Javasakuna Jataka._ I have ventured to English Prof.\nFausboll\'s version, which was only intended as a "crib" to the Pali. For the\nomitted Introduction, see _supra.\n\nParallels.--_I __ have given a rather full collection of parallels, running to\nabout a hundred numbers, in my Aesop, pp. 232--4. The chief of these are: (1)\nfor the East, the Midrashic version (" Lion and Egyptian Partridge "), in the\ngreat Rabbinic commentary on Genesis _(Bereshithrabba,_ c. 64); (2) in\nclassical antiquity, Phaedrus, i. 8 (" Wolf and Crane "), and Babrius, 94\n("Wolf and Heron"), and the Greek proverb Suidas, ii, 248 (" Out of the Wolf\'s\nMouth"); (3) in the Middle Ages, the so-called Greek _Aesop._ ed. Halm; 276\n_b_ , really prose versions of Babrius and "Romulus," or prose of Phaedrus, i.\n8, also the Romulus of Ademar (fl. 1030), 64; it occurs also on the Bayeux\nTapestry, in Marie de France, 7, and in Benedict of Oxford\'s _Mishle Shualim_\n(Heb.), 8; (4) Stainhowel took it from the " Romulus" into his German Aesop\n(1480), whence all the modern European Aesops are derived.\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ I __ have selected _The Wolf and the Crane_ as my typical example\nin my "History of the Aesopic Fable," and can only give here a rough summary\nof the results I there arrived at concerning the fable, merely premising that\nthese results are at present no more than hypotheses. The similarity of the\nJataka form with that familiar to us, and derived by us in the last resort\nfrom Phaedrus, is so striking that few will deny some historical relation\nbetween them. I conjecture that the Fable originated in India, and came West,\nby two different routes. First, it came by oral tradition to Egypt, as one of\nthe Libyan Fables which the ancients themselves distinguished from the Aesopic\nFables. It was, however, included by Demetrius Phalereus, tyrant of Athens,\nand founder of the Alexandrian library c. 300 B.C., in his _Assemblies of\nAesopic Fables,_ which I have shown to be the source of Phaedrus\' Fables c. 30\nA.D. Besides this, it came from Ceylon in the Fables of Kybises--i.e., Kasyapa\nthe Buddha--c. 50 A.D., was adapted into Hebrew, and used for political\npurposes, by Rabbi Joshua ben Chananyah in a harangue to the Jews, c. 120\nA.D., begging them to be patient while within the jaws of Rome. The Hebrew\nform uses the lion, not the wolf, as the ingrate, which enables us to decide\non the Indian _provenance_ of the Midrashic version. It may be remarked that\nthe use of the lion in this and other Jatakas is indirectly a testimony to\ntheir great age, as the lion has become rarer and rarer in India during\nhistoric times, and is now confined to the Gir forest of Kathiawar, where only\na dozen specimens exist, and are strictly preserved.\n\nThe verses at the end are the earliest parts of the Jataka, being in more\narchaic Pali than the rest: the story is told by the commentator (c. 400 AD)\nto illustrate them. It is probable that they were brought over on the first\nintroduction of Buddhism into Ceylon, c. 241 B.C. This would give them an age\nof aver two thousand years, nearly three hundred years earlier than Phaedrus,\nfrom whom comes our _Wolf and Crane.\n\n_\n\nII. PRINCESS LABAM.\n\n_\n\nSource.--_ Miss __ Stokes, _Indian Fairy Tales,_ No. xxii. pp. 153--63, told\nby Maniya, one of the ayahs. I have left it unaltered, except that I have\nreplaced" God" by " Khuda," the word originally used (see Notes _l. c.,_ p.\n237).\n\n_\n\nParallels.--_ The __ tabu, as to a particular direction, occurs in other\nIndian stories as well as in European folk-tales (see notes on Stokes, p.\n286). The _grateful animals_ theme occurs in "The Soothsayer\'s Son" _(infra,_\nNo. x.), and frequently in Indian folk-tales (see Temple\'s Analysis, III. i. 5\n--7; _Wideawake Stories,_ pp.412--3). The thorn in the tiger\'s foot is\nespecially common (Temple, _l. c_., 6, 9), and recalls the story of Androclus,\nwhich occurs in the derivates of Phaedrus, and may thus be Indian in origin\n(see Benfey _,Panschatantra,_ i. 211,and the parallels given in my _Aesop,_\nRo. iii.-1, p. 243). The theme is, however, equally frequent in European folk-\ntales: see my List of Incidents, _Proc. Folk-Lore Congress,_ p. 91, s.v.\n"Grateful Animals" and "Gifts by Grateful Animals." Similarly, the " Bride\nWager" incident at the end is common to a large number of Indian and European\nfolk-tales (Temple, Analysis, p. 430; my List, _l.c. sub voce)._ The tasks are\nalso equally common _(c.f._ "Battle of the Birds " in _Celtic Fairy Tales),_\nthough the exact forms as given in "Princess Labam" are not known in Europe.\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ We __ have here a concrete instance of the relation of Indian and\nEuropean fairy-tales. The human mind may be the same everywhere, but it is not\nlikely to hit upon the sequence of incidents, _Direction tabu--Grateful\nAnimals--Bride-Wager--Tasks,_ by accident or independently: Europe must have\nborrowed from India, or India from Europe. As this must have occurred within\nhistoric times, indeed within the last thousand years, when even European\npeasants are not likely to have _invented,_ even if they believed, in the\nincident of the grateful animals, the probability is in favour of borrowing\nfrom India, possibly through the intermediation of Arabs at the time of the\nCrusades. It is only a probability, but we cannot in any case reach more than\nprobability in this matter, just at present.\n\nIII. LAMBIKIN.\n\nSource.--Steel-Temple, _Wideawake Stories_ , pp _._ 69--72, originally\npublished in _Indian Antiquary,_ xii. 175. The droll is common throughout the\nPanjab.\n\n_\n\nParallels.--_ The __ similarity of the concluding episode with the finish of\nthe "Three Little Pigs" _(Eng. Fairy Tales,_ No. xiv.). In my notes on that\ndroll I have pointed out that the pigs were once goats or kids with "hair on\ntheir chinny chin chin." This brings the tale a stage nearer to the Lambikin.\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ The __ similarity of Pig No. 3 rolling down hill in the churn and\nthe Lambikin in the Drumikin can scarcely be accidental; though, it must be\nconfessed, the tale has undergone considerable modification before it reached\nEngland.\n\nIV. PUNCHKIN,\n\n_\n\nSource.--_ Miss __ Frere, _Old Deccan Days,_ pp. 1--16, from her ayah, Anna de\nSouza, of a Lingaet family settled and Christianised at Goa for three\ngenerations. I should perhaps add that a Prudhan is a Prime Minister or\nVizier; Punts are the same, and Sirdars, nobles.\n\n_\n\nParallels.--_ The __ son of seven mothers is a characteristic Indian\nconception, for which see Notes on "The Son of Seven Queens" in this\ncollection, No. xvi. The mother transformed, envious stepmother, ring\nrecognition, are all incidents common to East and West; bibliographical\nreferences for parallels may be found under these titles in my List of\nIncidents. The external soul of the ogre has been studied by Mr. E. Clodd in\n_Folk-Lore Journal,_ vol. ii., "The Philosophy of Punchkin," and still more\nelaborately in the section, "The External Soul in Folk-Tales," in Mr. Frazer\'s\n_Golden Bough,_ ii. pp. 296--326. See also \'Major Temple\'s Analysis, II. iii.,\n_Wideawake Stories,_ pp. 404 - 5, who there gives the Indian parallels.\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ Both __ Mr. Clodd and Mr. Frazer regard the essence of the tale to\nconsist in the conception of an external soul or "life-index," and they both\ntrace in this a \'survival" of savage philosophy, which they consider occurs\namong all men at a certain stage of culture. But the most cursory examination\nof the sets of tales containing these incidents in Mr. Frazer\'s analyses shows\nthat many, indeed the majority, of these tales cannot be independent of one\nanother; for they contain not alone the incident of an external materialised\nsoul, but the further point that this is contained in something else, which is\nenclosed in another thing, which is again surrounded by a wrapper. This\nChinese ball arrangement is found in the Deccan (" Punchkin"); in Bengal (Day,\n_Folk-Tales of Bengal);_ in Russia (Ralston, p. 103 _seq.,_ "Koschkei the\nDeathless," also in Mr. Lang\'s _Red Fairy Book);_ in Servia (Mijatovics,\n_Servian Folk-Lore,_ p. 172); in South Slavonia (Wratislaw, p. 225); in Rome\n(Miss Busk, p. 164); in Albania (Dozon, p. 132 _seq.);_ in Transylvania\n(Haltrich, No. 34); in Schleswig-Holstein (Mullenhoff, p. 404); in Norway\n(Asbjornsen, No. 36, _ap_. Dasent, _Pop. Tales,_ p. 55, "The Giant who had no\nHeart in his Body"); and finally, in the Hebrides (Campbell, _Pop. Tales,_ p.\n10, _cf. Celtic Fairy Tales,_ No. xvii., "Sea Maiden "). Here we have the\ntrack of this remarkable idea of an external soul enclosed in a succession of\nwrappings, which we can trace from Hindostan to the Hebrides.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine that we have not here the actual migration of the\ntale from East to West. In Bengal we have the soul "in a necklace, in a box,\nin the heart of a _boal_ fish, in a tank"; in Albania "it is in a pigeon, in a\nhare, in the silver tusk of a wild boar"; in Rome it is "in a stone, in the\nhead of a bird, in the head of a leveret, in the middle head of a seven-headed\nhydra"; in Russia "it is in an egg, in a duck, in a hare, in a casket, in an\noak"; in Servia it is "in a board, in the heart of a fox, in a mountain"; in\nTransylvania "it is in a light, in an egg, in a duck, in a pond, in a\nmountain;"in Norway it is "in an egg, in a duck, in a well, in a church, on an\nisland, in a lake"; in the Hebrides it is "in an egg, in the belly of a duck,\nin the belly of a wether, under a flagstone on the threshold." It is\nimpossible to imagine the human mind independently imagining such bizarre\nconvolutions. They were borrowed from one nation to the other, and till we\nhave reason shown to the contrary, the original lender was a Hindu. I should\nadd that the mere conception of an external soul occurs in the oldest Egyptian\ntale of "The Two Brothers," but the wrappings are absents\n\nV. __ THE BROKEN POT.\n\n_\n\nSource.--Pantschatantra,_ V. ix,, tr. Benfey, ii. 345--6.\n\n_\n\nParallels.--Benfey,_ in \xc2\xa7 209 of his _Einleitung,_ gives bibliographical\nreferences to most of those which are given at length in Prof. M. Muller\'s\nbrilliant essay on "The Migration of Fables" _(Selected Essays,_ i. 500--76),\nwhich is entirely devoted to the travels of the fable from India to La\nFontaine. See also Mr. Clouston, _Pop. Tales,_ ii. 432 _seq._ I have\ntranslated the Hebrew version in my essay, "Jewish Influence on the Diffusion\nof Folk-Tales," pp. 6--7. Our proverb, "Do not count your chickens before they\nare hatched," is ultimately to be derived from India.\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ The __ stories of Alnaschar, the Barber\'s fifth brother in the\n_Arabian Nights,_ and of La Perette, who counted her chickens before they were\nhatched, in La Fontaine, are demonstrably derived from the same Indian\noriginal from which our story was obtained. The travels of the "Fables of\nBidpai" from India to Europe are well known and distinctly traceable. I have\ngiven a rough summary of the chief critical results in the introduction to my\nedition of the earliest English version of, the _Fables of Bidpai,_ by Sir\nThomas North, of Plutarch fame (London, D. Nutt, "Bibliotheque de Carabas,"\n1888), where I have given an elaborate genealogical table of the multitudinous\nversions. La Fontaine\'s version, which has rendered the fable so familiar to\nus all, comes from Bonaventure des Periers, _Contes et Nouvelles,_ who got it\nfrom the _Dialogus Creaturarum_ of Nicholaus Pergamenus, who derived it from\nthe _Sermones_ of Jacques de Vitry (see Prof. Crane\'s edition, No., li.), who\nprobably derived it from the _Directorium Humanae Vita_ of John of Capua, a\nconverted Jew, who translated it from the Hebrew version of the Arabic\n_Kalilah wa Dimnah,_ which was itself derived from the old Syriac version of a\nPehlevi translation of the original Indian work, probably called after\nKarataka and Damanaka, the names of two jackals who figure in the earlier\nstories of the book. Prof. Rhys-Davids informs me that these names are more\nakin to Pali than to Sanskrit, which makes it still more probable that the\nwhole literature is ultimately to be derived from a Buddhist source.\n\nThe theme of La Perette is of interest as showing the _literary_ transmission\nof tales from Orient to Occident. It also shows the possibility of an\ninfluence of literary on oral tradition, as is shown by our proverb, and by\nthe fact, which Benfey mentions, that La Fontaine\'s story has had influence on\ntwo of Grimm\'s tales, Nos. 164, 168.\n\nVI. THE MAGIC FIDDLE.\n\n_\n\nSource.--_ A. __ Campbell, _Santal Folk Tales,_ 1892, pp. 52 - 6, with some\nverbal alterations. A Bonga is the presiding spirit of a certain kind of rice\nland; Doms and Hadis are low-caste aborigines, whose touch is considered\npolluting. The Santals are a forest tribe, who live in the Santal Parganas,\n140 miles N.W. of Calcutta (Sir W. W. Hunter, _The Indian Empire,_ 57 - 60).\n\nParallels.--Another version occurs in Campbell, p. 106 _seq.,_ which shows\nthat the story is popular among the Santals. It is obvious, however, that\nneither version contains the real finish of the story, which must have\ncontained the denunciation of the magic fiddle of the murderous sisters. This\nwould bring it under the formula of _The Singing Bone,_ which M. Monseur has\nrecently been studying with a remarkable collection of European variants in\nthe Bulletin of the Wallon Folk-Lore Society of Liege _(cf Eng. Fairy Tales,_\nNo. ix.). There is a singing bone in Steel-Temple\'s _Wideawake Stories,_ pp.\n127 _seq._ (" Little Anklebone ").\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ Here __ we have another theme of the common store of European\nfolk-tales found in India. Unfortunately, the form in which it occurs is\nmutilated, and we cannot draw any definite conclusion from it.\n\nVII. THE CRUEL CRANE OUTWITTED.\n\n_\n\nSource.--_ The __ Baka-Jataka, Fausboll, No. 38, tr. Rhys-Davids, pp. 315--21.\nThe Buddha this time is the Genius of the Tree.\n\n![](img/79.jpg)\n\n_\n\nParallels.--_ This __ Jataka got into the Bidpai literature, and occurs in all\nits multitudinous offshoots _(see_ Benfey, _Einleilung,_ \xc2\xa7 6o) among others in\nthe earliest English translation by North (my edition, pp. 118--22), where the\ncrane becomes "a great Paragone of India (of those that liue a hundredth\nyeares and neuer mue their feathers)." The crab, on hearing the ill news\n"called to Parliament all the Fishes of the Lake," and before all are devoured\ndestroys the Paragon, as in the Jataka, and returned to the remaining fishes,\nwho "all with one consent give hir many a thanke."\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ An __ interesting point, to which I have drawn attention in my\nIntroduction to North\'s Bidpai, is the probability that the illustrations of\nthe tales as well as the tales themselves, were translated, so to speak, from\none, country to another. We can trace them in Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic MSS.,\nand a few are extant on Buddhist Stupas. Under these circumstances, it may be\nof interest to compare with Mr. Batten\'s conception of the Crane and the Crab\nthat of the German artist who illustrated the first edition of the Latin\nBidpai, probably following the traditional representations of the MS., which\nitself could probably trace back to India.\n\nVIII. LOVING LAILI\n\nSource.--Miss Stokes, _Indian_ _Fairy Tales,_ pp. 73--84. Majnun and Laili are\nconventional names for lovers, the Romeo and Juliet of Hindostan.\n\n_\n\nParallels.--_ Living __ in animals\' bellies occurs elsewhere in Miss Stokes\'\nbook, pp. 66, 124; also in Miss Frere\'s, 188. The restoration of beauty by\nfire occurs as a frequent theme (Temple, Analysis, III. vi. f. p. 418).\nReaders will be reminded of the _d enouement _of Mr. Rider Haggard\'s _She._\nResuscitation from ashes has been used very effectively by Mr. Lang in his\ndelightful _Prince Prigio.\n\nRemarks.--_The __ white skin and blue eyes of Prince Majnun deserve attention.\nThey are possibly a relic of the days of Aryan conquest, when the fair-\nskinned, fair-haired Aryan conquered the swarthier aboriginals. The name for\ncaste in Sanskrit is _varna,_ "colour"; and one Hindu cannot insult another\nmore effectually than by calling him a black man. _Cf._ Stokes, pp. 238--9,\nwho suggests that the red hair is something solar, and derived from myth\'s of\nthe solar hero.\n\nIX. THE TIGER, THE BRAHMAN, AND THE JACKAL\n\nSource.--Steel-Temple, _Wideawake Stories,_ pp. 116--20; first published in\n_Indian Antiquary,_ xii. p. 170 _seq.\n\nParallels.--_No __ less than 94 parallels are given by Prof. K. Krohn in his\nelaborate discussion of this fable in his dissertation, _Mann und Fuchs_\n(Helsingfors, 1891), pp. 38--60; to which may be added three Indian variants,\nomitted by him, but mentioned by Capt Temple, _l.c._., p. 324 in the\n_Bhdgavata Purana,_ the _Gui Bakaoli_ and _Ind. Ant_ xii. 177; and a couple\nmore in my _Aesop,_ p. 253: add Smeaton, _Karens,_ p. 126.\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ Prof _._ Krohn comes to the conclusion that the majority of the\noral forms of the tale come from literary versions (p. 47), whereas the\n_Reynard_ form has only had influence on a single variant. He reduces the\ncentury of variants to three type forms. The first occurs in two Egyptian\nversions collected in the present day, as well as in Petrus Alphonsi in the\ntwelfth century, and the _Fabulae Extravagantes_ of the thirteenth or\nfourteenth: here the ingrate animal is a crocodile, which asks to be carried\naway from a river about to dry up, and there is only one judge. The second is\nthat current in India and represented by the story in the present collection:\nhere the judges are three. The third is that current among Western Europeans,\nwhich has spread to S. Africa and N. and S. America: also three judges. Prof.\nK. Krohn counts the first the original form, owing to the single judge and the\nnaturalness of the opening, by which the critical situation is brought about.\nThe further question arises, whether this form, though found in Egypt now, is\nindigenous there, and if so, how it got to the East. Prof. Krohn grants the\npossibility of the Egyptian form having been invented in lndia and carried to\nEgypt, and he allows that the European forms have been influenced by the\nIndian. The "Egyptian" form is found in Burmah (Smeaton, _l.c.,_ p. 128), as\nwell as the Indian, a fact of which Prof. H. Krohn was unaware, though it\nturns his whole argument. The evidence we have of other folk-tales of the\nbeast-epic emanating from India improves the chances of this also coming from\nthat source. One thing at least is certain: all these hundred variants come\nultimately from one source. The incident "Inside again" of the _Arabian\nNights_ (the Djinn and the bottle) and European tales is also a secondary\nderivate.\n\nX. THE SOOTHSAYER\'S SON.\n\n_\n\nSource.--_ Mrs _._ Kingscote, _Tales of the Sun_ (p. 11 _seq.),_ from Pandit\nNatesa Sastri\'s _Folk-Lore of Southern India,_ pt. ii., originally from _Ind.\nAntiquary._ I have considerably condensed and modified the somewhat Babu\nEnglish of the original.\n\n_\n\nParallels.--_ See __ Benfey, _Pantschatantra,_ \xc2\xa7 71, i. pp. 193--222, who\nquotes the _Kama Jataka_ as the ultimate source: it also occurs in the\n_Saccankira jataka_ (Fausboll, No. 73), trans. Rev. R. Morris, _Folk-Lore\njour._ iii. 348 _seq._ The story of the ingratitude of man compared with the\ngratitude of beasts came early to the West, where it occurs in the _Gesta\nRomanorum,_ c. 119., It was possibly from an early form of this collection\nthat Richard Coeur de Lion got the story, and used it to rebuke the\ningratitude of the English nobles on his return in 1195. Matthew Paris tells\nthe story, _sub anno_ (it is an addition of his to Ralph _Disset),Hist.\nMajor,ed._ Luard, ii. 413--6, how a lion and a serpent and a Venetian named\nVitalis were saved from a pit by a woodman, Vitalis promising him half his\nfortune, fifty talents. The lion brings his benefactor a leveret, the serpent\n"gemmam pretiosam," probably \'the precious jewel in his head" to which\nShakespeare alludes _(As You Like It,_ ii. 1, _cf_ Benfey, _I. c.,_ p. 214,\n_n.),_ but Vitalis refuses to have anything to do with him, and altogether\nrepudiates the fifty talents. "Haec referebat Rex Richardus munificus,\ningratos redarguendo."\n\n_\n\nRemarks.---_ Apart __ from the interest of its wide travels, and its\nappearance in the standard mediaeval History of England by Matthew Paris, the\nmodern story shows the remarkable persistence of folk-tales in the popular\nmind. Here we have collected from the Hindu peasant of today a tale which was\nprobably told before Buddha, over two thousand years ago, and certainly\nincluded among the Jatakas before the Christian era. The same thing has\noccurred with _The Tiger, Brahman and jackal_ (No. ix. _supra_ ).\n\nXI. HARISARMAN.\n\n_\n\nSource .--_ Somadeva _, Kathit-Sarit.-Sagara,_ trans. Tawney (Calcutta, 1880),\ni. pp. 272--4. I have slightly toned down the inflated style of the original.\n\n_\n\nParallels.--_ Benfey __ has collected and discussed a number in _Orient and\nOccident,_ i. 371 _seq.;_ see also Tawney, _ad loc._ The most remarkable of\nthe parallels is that afforded by the Grimms\' "Doctor Aliwissend" (No. 98),\nwhich extends even to such a minute point as his exclamation, "Ach, ich armer\nKrebs," whereupon a crab is discovered under a dish. The usual form of\ndiscovery of the thieves is for the Dr. Knowall to have so many days given him\nto discover the thieves, and at the end of the first day he calls out,\n"There\'s one of them," meaning the days, just as one of the thieves peeps\nthrough at him. Hence the title and the plot of C. Lever\'s _One of Them.\n\n_\n\nXII. THE CHARMED RING.\n\nSource.--Knowles, _Folk-Tales of Kashmir,_ pp. 20-8.\n\n_\n\nParallels.--_ The __ incident of the Aiding Animals. is frequent in folk-\ntales; see bibliographical references, _sub voce,_ in my List of Incidents,\n_Trans. Folk-Lore Congress,_ p. 88; also Knowles, 21, _n._ ; and Temple,\n_Wideawake Stories,_ pp. 401, 412. The Magic Ring is also "common form" in\nfolk-tales; _cf_ Kohler _ap._ Marie de France, _Lais,_ ed. Warncke, p. lxxxiv.\nAnd the whole story is to be found very widely spread from India _(Wideawake\nStories,_ pp. 196--206) to England _(Eng. Fairy Tales,_ No. xvii., "Jack and\nhis Golden Snuff-box," _cf._ Notes, _ibid.),_ the most familiar form of it\nbeing "Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp."\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ M. __ Cosquin has pointed out _(Contes de Lorraine_ ,p.xi _.\nseq.)_ that the incident of the rat\'s-tail-up-nose to recover the ring from\nthe stomach of an ogress, is found among Arabs, Albanians, Bretons, and\nRussians. It is impossible to imagine that incident--occurring in the same\nseries of incidents--to have been invented more than once, and if that part of\nthe story has been borrowed from India, there is no reason why the whole of it\nshould not have arisen in India, and have been spread to the West. The English\nvariant was derived from an English Gipsy, and suggests the possibility that\nfor this particular story the medium of transmission has been the Gipsies.\nThis contains the incident of the loss of the ring by the faithful animal,\nwhich again could not have been independently invented.\n\nXIII. THE TALKATIVE TORTOISE.\n\n![](img/80.jpg)\n\n_\n\nSource.--_ The _Kacchapa Jataka,_ Fausboll, No. 215 also in his _Five\nJatakas,_ pp. 16, 41, tr. Rhys-Davids, pp. viii.--x.\n\n_\n\nParallels.--_ It __ occurs also in the Bidpai literature, in nearly all its\nmultitudinous offshoots. See Benfey, _Einleitung,_ \xc2\xa7 84; also my _Bidptai,_ E,\n4. _a;_ and North\'s text, pp. 170 - 5, where it is the taunts of the other\nbirds that cause the catastrophe: "O here is a brave sight, looke, here is a\ngoodly ieast, what bugge haue we here," said some. "See, see, fhe hangeth by\nthe throte, and therefor fhe fpeaketh not," saide others; "and the beast\nflieth not like a beast;" so she opened her mouth and "pafhte hir all to\npieces."\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ I __ have reproduced in my edition the original illustration of\nthe first English Bidpai, itself derived from the Italian block. A replica of\nit here may serve to show that it could be used equally well to illustrate the\nPali original as its English great-great-great-great-great-great grand-child.\n\nXIV. LAC OF RUPEES.\n\nSource--Knowles, _Folk-Tales of Kashmir,_ pp. 32--4I. I have reduced the\npieces of advice to three, and curtailed somewhat.\n\n_\n\nParallels -_ See _Celtic Fairy Tales,_ No. xxii., "Tale of Ivan," from the old\nCornish, now extinct, and notes _ibid._ Mr. Clouston points out _(Pop. Tales,_\nii. 3:9) that it occurs in Buddhist literature, in "Buddaghoshas Parables," as\n"The Story of Kulla Pauthaka."\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ It is indeed curious to find the story better told in Cornwall\nthan in the land of its birth, but there can be little doubt that the Buddhist\nversion is the earliest and original form of the story. The piece of advice\nwas originally a charm, in which a youth was to say to himself, "Why are you\nbusy? Why are you busy?" He does so when thieves are about, and so saves the\nking\'s treasures, of which he gets an appropriate share. It would perhaps be\nas well if many of us should say to ourselves, " _Ghatesa, ghatesa, kim\nkarana?"\n\n_\n\nXV. THE GOLD-GIVING SERPENT.\n\n_\n\nSource.--Pantschatantra,_ III. v., tr. Benfey, ii. 244--7.\n\n_\n\nParallels_ given in my _.Aesop,_ Ro. ii. 10, p. 40. The chief points about\nthem are--(1) though the tale does not exist in either Phaedrus or Babrius, it\noccurs in prose derivates from the Latin by Ademar, 65, and "Romulus," ii. 10,\nand from Greek, in Gabrias, 45, and the prose _Aesop,_ ed. Halm, 96; Gitlbauer\nhas restored the Babrian form in his edition of Babrius, No. 160. (2) The\nfable occurs among folk-tales Grimm, 105; Woycicki, _Poln. M ahr. _105;\nGering, _Islensk. Aevent._ 59, possibly derived from La Fontaine, x. 12.\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ Benfey __ has proved most ingeniously and conclusively _(Einl._ i.\n359) that the Indian fable is the source of both Latin and Greek fables. I may\nborrow from my _Aesop,_ p. 93, parallel abstracts of the three versions,\nputting Benfey\'s results in a graphic form, series of bars indicating the\npassages where the classical fables have failed to preserve the original.\n\n_\n\nBidpai\n\n_\n\nA Brahmin once observed a snake in his field, and thinking it the tutelary\nspirit of the field, he offered it a libation of milk in a bowl. Next day he\nfinds a piece of gold in the bowl, and he recieves this each day after\noffering the libation. One day he had to go else-where, and he sent his son\nwith the libation. The son sees the gold, and thinking the serpent\'s hole full\nof treasure determines to slay the snake. He strikes at its head with a\ncudgel, and the enraged serpent stings him to death. The Brahmin mourns his\nson\'s death, but next morning as usual brings the libation of milk (in the\nhope of getting the gold as before). The serpent appears after a long delay at\nthe mouth of the lair, and declares their friendship at an end, as it could\nnot forget the blow of the Brahmin\'s son, nor the Brahmin his son\'s death,\nfrom the bite of the snake.  \n_Pants_. III. v. (Benf. 244 - 7)\n\n_\n\nPhaedrine.\n\n_\n\n... A good man had become friendly with the snake, who came into his house and\nbrought luck with it, so that the man became rich through it ... One day he\nstruck the serpent, which disappeared, and with it the man\'s riches. The good\nman tries to make it up, but the serpent declares their friendship at an end,\nas it could not forget the blow. ...  \nPhaed. Dressl. VII. 28 (Rom. II. xi.)\n\n  \n_Babrian_  \n...........  \nA serpent stung a farmer\'s son to death. The father pursued the serpent with\nan axe, and struck off part of its tail. Afterwards fearing its vengence he\nbrought food and honey to its lair, and begged reconciliation. The serpent,\nhowever, declares friendship impossible, as it could not forget the blow ...\nnor the farmer his son\'s death from the bite of the snake.  \nAesop, Halm 96b (Babrius-Gitlb. 160)\n\nIn the Indian fable every step of the action is thoroughly justified whereas\nthe Latin form does not explain why the snake was friendly in the first\ninstance, or why the good man was enraged afterwards; and the Greek form\nstarts abruptly, without explaining why the serpent had killed the farmer\'s\nSon. Make a composite of the Phaedrine and Babrian forms, and you get the\nIndian one, which is thus shown to be the original of both.\n\nXVI. THE SON OF SEVEN QUEENS.\n\nSource.--Steel-Temple, _Wideawake Stories, pp._ 98--110, originally published\nin _Ind. Antiq._ x. __ 147 _seq.\n\nParallels.--_A __ long variant follows in _Ind. Antiq., l. c._ M. Cosquin\nrefers to several Oriental variants, _I. c._ p. xxx _. n._ For the direction\ntabu, see Note on Princess Labam, _supra,_ No. ii. The "letter to kill bearer"\nand "letter substituted" are frequent in both European (see my List, s. _v.)_\nand Indian Folk-Tales (Temple, Analysis, II. iv. _b_ , 6, p. 410). The idea of\na son of seven mothers could only arise in a polygamous country. It occurs in\n"Punchkin," _supra,_ No. iv.; Day, _Folk-Tales of Bengal,_ 117 _seq.; Ind.\nAntiq._ i. 170 (Temple, _l. c.,_ 398).\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ M. __ Cosquin _(Contes de Lorraine,_ p. xxx _.)_ points out how,\nin a Sicilian story, Gonzenbach _(Sizil. M ahr. _No. 80), the seven co-queens\nare transformed into seven step-daughters of the envious witch who causes\ntheir eyes to be taken out; It is thus probable, though M. Cosquin does not\npoint this out, that the "envious stepmother" of folk-tales (see my List, _s.\nv.)_ was originally an envious co-wife. But there can be little doubt of what\nM. Cosquin _does_ point out--viz., that the Sicilian story is derived from the\nIndian one.\n\nXVII. A LESSON FOR KINGS.\n\n_\n\nSource.--Rajovada Jataka,_ Fausboll, No. 151, tr. Rhys-Davids, pp _._ xxii.--\nvi.\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--This_ is one of the earliest of moral allegories in existence. The\nmoralising tone of the Jatakas must be conspicuous to all reading them.

PRIDE GOETH BEFORE A FALL.\n\nSource.--Kingscote, _Tales of the Sun._ I have changed the Indian mercantile\nnumerals into those of English "back-slang," which make a very good parallel.\n\nXIX. RAJA RASALU.\n\nSource.--Steel-Temple, _Wideawake Stories,_ pp. 247 - 80, omitting "How Raja\nRasalu was Born," "How Raja Rasalu\'s Friends Forsook Him," "How Raja Rasalu\nKilled the Giants," and "How Raja Rasalu became a Jogi." A further version in\nTemple, _Legends of_ _Panjab,_ vol. i. _Chaupur,_ I should explain, is a game\nplayed by two players with eight men, each on a board in the shape of a cross,\nfour men to each cross covered with squares. The moves of the men are decided\nby the throws of a long form of dice. The object of the game is to see which\nof the players can first move all his men into the black centre square of the\ncross (Temple, _l. c.,_ p. 344, and _Legends of Panjab,_ i. 243--5). It is\nsometimes said to be the origin of chess.\n\n_\n\nParallels.--_ Rev _._ C. Swynnerton, "Four Legends about Raja Rasalu," in\n_Folk-Lore Journal,_ p. 158 _seq.,_ also in separate book much enlarged, _The\nAdventures of Raja Rasalu,_ Calcutta, 1884. Curiously enough, the real\ninterest of the story comes after the end of our part of it, for Kokilan, when\nshe grows up, is married to Raja Rasalu, and behaves as sometimes youthful\nwives behave to elderly husbands. He gives her her lover\'s heart to eat, _a_\n_la_ Decameron, and she dashes herself over the rocks. For the parallels of\nthis part of the legend see my edition of Painter\'s _Palace of Pleasure,_ tom.\ni. Tale 39, or, better, the _Programm_ of H. Patzig, _Zur Geschichte der\nHerzmare_ (Berlin, 1891). Gambling for life occurs in Celtic and other folk-\ntales; _cf._ my List of Incidents, _s._ v. "Gambling for Magic Objects."\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ Raja __ Rasalu is possibly an historic personage, according to\nCapt. Temple, _Calcutta Review,_ 1884, p. 397, flourishing in the eighth or\nninth century. There is a place called Sirikap ka-kila in the neighbourhood of\nSialkot, the traditional seat of Rasalu on the Indus, not far from Atlock.\n\nHerr Patzig is strongly for the Eastern origin of the romance, and finds its\nearliest appearance in the West in the Anglo-Norman troubadour, Thomas\' _Lar\nGuirun,_ where it becomes part of the Tristan cycle. There is, so far as I\nknow, no proof of the earliest part of the Rasalu legend _(our_ part) coming\nto Europe, except the existence of the gambling incidents of the same kind in\nCeltic and other folk-tales.\n\nXX.

There can be little doubt that the Ass in the Lion\'s\nSkin is from India. As Prof. Rhys-Davids remarks, the Indian form gives a\nplausible motive for the masquerade which is wanting in the ordinary Aesopic\nversion.\n\nXXI. THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER.\n\nSource.--Steel-Temple, _Wideawake Stories_ , pp _._ 215--18.\n\n_\n\nParallels_ enumerated in my _Aesop,_ Av. xvii. See also Jacques de Vitry,\n_Exempla,_ ed.

Mr. Kipling has a very\nsimilar tale in his _Life\'s Handicap.\n\nRemarks.--_Here __ we have collected in modern India what one cannot help\nthinking is the Indian original of a fable of Avian. The preceding number\nshowed one of his fables existing among the Jatakas, probably before the\nChristian era. This makes it likely that we shall find an earlier Indian\noriginal of the fable of the Avaricious and Envious, perhaps among the Jatakas\nstill untranslated.\n\nXXII.

The choice of the hero disguised as a\nmenial is also common property of Indian and European fairy tales: see Stokes,\n_l.c_., p. 231, and my List of Incidents _(s. v_. "Mental Disguise").\n\nXXIII.

Prof.\nBenfey, in an elaborate dissertation (" Die Kluge Dime," in _Ausland,_ 1859,\nNos. 20--25, now reprinted in _Kl. Sckr._ ii. 156 _seq.),_ has shown the wide\nspread of the theme both in early Indian literature (though probably there\nderived from the folk) and in modern European folk literature.\n\nXXV. THE DEMON WITH THE MATTED HAIR.\n\n_\n\nSource.--_ The _Pancavudha-Jataka,_ Fausboll, No. 55 _,_ kindly translated for\nthis book by Mr. W. H. D. Rouse, of Christ\'s College, Cambridge. There is a\nbrief abstract of the Jataka in Prof. Estlin Carpenter\'s sermon, _Three Ways\nof Salvation,_ 1884, p. 27, where my attention was first called to this\nJataka.\n\n_\n\nParallels.--_ Most __ readers of these Notes will remember the central episode\nof Mr. J _._ C. Harris\' _Uncle Remus,_ in which Brer Fox, annoyed at Brer\nRabbit\'s depredations, fits up "a contrapshun, what he calls a Tar Baby." Brer\nRabbit coming along that way, passes the time of day with Tar Baby, and,\nannoyed at its obstinate silence, hits it with right fist and with left, with\nleft fist and with right, which successively stick to the "contrapshun," till\nat last he butts with his bead, and that sticks too, whereupon Brer Fox, who\nall this time had "lain low," saunters out, and complains of Brer Rabbit that\nlie is too stuck up. In the sequel Brer Rabbit begs Brer Fox that he may\n"drown me as deep ez you please, skin me, scratch out my eyeballs, tar out my\nyears by the roots, en cut off my legs, but don\'t fling me in dat brier\npatch;" which, of course, Brer Fox does, only to be informed by the cunning\nBrer Rabbit that he had been "bred en bawn in a brier patch." The story is a\nfavourite one with the negroes: it occurs in Col. Jones\' _Negro Myths of the\nGeorgia Coast_ (Uncle Remus is from S. Carolina), also among those of Brazil\n(Romero, _Contos do Brazil),_ and in the West Indian Islands (Mr. Lang, "At\nthe Sign of the Ship, _Longman\'s Magazine,_ Feb. 1889). We can trace it to\nAfrica, where it occurs in Cape Colony _(South African Folk-Lore Journal;_\nvol. i.).\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ The __ fivefold attack on the Demon and the Tar Baby is so\npreposterously ludicrous that it cannot have been independently invented, and\nwe must therefore assume that they are casually connected, and the existence\nof the variant in South Africa clinches the matter, and gives us a landing-\nstage between India and America. There can be little doubt that the Jataka of\nPrince Five Weapons came to Africa, possibly by Buddhist missionaries, spread\namong the negroes, and then took ship in the holds of slavers for the New\nWorld, where it is to be found in fuller form than any yet discovered in the\nhome of its birth. I say Buddhist missionaries, because there is a certain\namount of evidence that the negroes have Buddhistic symbols among them, and we\ncan only explain the identification of Brer Rabbit with Prince Five Weapons,\nand so with Buddha himself, by supposing the change to have originated among\nBuddhists, where it would be quite natural. For one of the most celebrated\nmetempsychoses of Buddha is that detailed in the _Sasa Jataka_ (Fausboll, No.\n316, tr. R. Morris, _Folk-Lore Journal,_ ii. 336), in which the Buddha, as a\nhare, performs a sublime piece of self-sacrifice, and as a reward is\ntranslated to the moon, where he can be seen to this day as "the hare in the\nmoon." Every Buddhist is reminded of the virtue of self-sacrifice whenever the\nmoon is full, and it is easy to understand how the Buddha became identified as\nthe Hare or Rabbit. A striking confirmation of this, in connection with our\nimmediate subject, is offered by Mr. Harris\' sequel volume, _Nights with Uncle\nRemus._ Here there is a whole chapter (xxx.) on "Brer Rabbit and his famous\nFoot," and it is well known how the worship of Buddha\'s foot developed in\nlater Buddhism. No wonder Brer Rabbit is so \'cute: he is nothing less than an\nincarnation of Buddha. Among the Karens of Burmah, where Buddhist influence is\nstill active, the Hare holds exactly the same place in their folk-lore as Brer\nRabbit among the negroes. The sixth chapter of Mr. Smeaton\'s book on them is\ndevoted to "Fireside Stories," and is entirely taken up with adventures of the\nHare, all of which can be paralleled from _Uncle Remus.\n\n_\n\nCuriously enough, the negro form of the fivefold attack--" fighting with five\nfists," Mr. Barr would call it--is probably nearer to the original legend than\nthat preserved in \'the Jataka, though 2000 years older. For we may be sure\nthat the thunderbolt of Knowledge did not exist in the original, but was\nintroduced by some Buddhist Mr. Barlow, who, like Alice\'s Duchess, ended all\nhis tales with: "And the moral of that is--" For no well-bred demon would have\nbeen taken in by so simple a "sell" as that indulged in by Prince Five-Weapons\nin our Jataka, and it is probable, therefore, that _Uncle Remus_ preserves a\nreminiscence of the original Indian reading of the tale. On the other hand, it\nis probable that Carlyle\'s Indian god with the fire in his belly was derived\nfrom Prince Five-Weapons.\n\nThe negro variant has also suggested to Mr. Batten an explanation of the whole\nstory, which is extremely plausible, though it introduces a method of folk-\nlore exegesis which has been overdriven to death. The _Sasa Jataka_ identifies\nthe Brer Rabbit Buddha with the hare in the moon. It is well known that\nEasterns explain an eclipse of the moon as due to its being swallowed up by a\nDragon or Demon. May not, asks Mr. Batten, the _Pancavudha-Jataka_ be an\nidealised account of an eclipse of the moon? This suggestion receives strong\nconfirmation from the Demon\'s reference to Rahu, who does, in Indian myth,\nswallow the moon at times of eclipse. The Jataka accordingly contains the\nBuddhist explanation why the moon--i.e. the hare in the moon, _i.e._ Buddha--\nis not altogether swallowed up by the Demon of Eclipse, the Demon with the\nMatted Hair. Mr. Batten adds that in imagining what kind of Demon the Eclipse\nDemon was, the Jataka writer was probably aided by recollections of some giant\noctopus, who has saucer eyes and a kind of hawk\'s beak, knobs on its "tusks,"\nand a very variegated belly (gasteropod). It is obviously unfair of Mr. Batten\nboth to illustrate and also to explain so well the Tar Baby Jataka--taking the\nscientific bread, so to speak, out of a poor folk-lorist\'s mouth--but his\nexplanations seem to me so convincing that I cannot avoid including them in\nthese Notes.\n\nI am, however, not so much concerned with the original explanation of the\nJataka as to trace its travels across the continents of Asia, Africa, and\nAmerica. I think I have done this satisfactorily, and will have thereby\nlargely strengthened the case for less extensive travels of other tales. I\nhave sufficient confidence of the method employed to venture on that most\nhazardous of employments, scientific prophecy. I venture to predict that the\nTar Baby story will be found in Madagascar in a form nearer the Indian than\nUncle Remus, and I will go further, and say that it will _not_ be found in the\ngrand Helsingfors collection of folk-tales, though this includes 12,000, of\nwhich 1000 are beast-tales.\n\nXXVI.

HOW WICKED SONS WERE DUPED.\n\n_\n\nSource.--_ Knowles _, Folk-Tales of Kashmir,_ pp _._ 241--2.\n\n_\n\nParallels.--_ A __ Gaelic parallel was given by Campbell in _Trans. Ethnol.\nSoc.,_ ii. p. 336; __ an Anglo-Latin one from the Middle Ages by T. Wright in\n_Latin Stories_ (Percy Soc.), No. 26; and for these and points of\nanthropological interest in the Celtic variant see Mr. Gomme\'s article in\n_Folk-Lore,_ i. pp. 197--206, "A Highland Folk-Tale and its Origin in Custom."\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ Mr. __ Gomme is of opinion that the tale arose from certain\nrhyming formulae occurring in the Gaelic and Latin tales as written on a\nmallet left by the old man in the box opened after his death. The rhymes are\nto the effect that a father who gives up his wealth to his children in his own\nlifetime deserves to be put to death with the mallet Mr. Gomme gives evidence\nthat it was an archaic custom to put oldsters to death after they had become\nhelpless. He also points out that it was customary for estates to be divided\nand surrendered during the owners\' lifetime, and generally he connects a good\ndeal of primitive custom with our story. I have already pointed out in _Folk-\nLore,_ p. __ 403, that the existence of the tale in Kashmir without any\nreference to the mallet makes it impossible for the rhymes on the mallet to be\nthe source of the story. As a matter of fact, it is a very embarrassing\naddition to it, since the rhyme tells against the parent, and the story is\nintended to tell against the ungrateful children. The existence of the tale in\nIndia renders it likely enough that it is not indigenous to the British Isles,\nbut an Oriental importation. It is obvious, therefore, that it cannot be used\nas anthropological evidence of the existence of the primitive customs to be\nfound ip it. The whole incident, indeed, is a striking example of the dangers\nof the anthropological met-hod of dealing with folk-tales before some attempt\nis made to settle the questions of origin and diffusion.\n\nXXIX. THE PIGEON AND THE CROW.\n\n_\n\nSource.--_ The _Lola Jataka,_ Fausboll, No. 274, kindly translated and\nslightly abridged for this book by Mr. W. H. D. Rouse.\n\n_\n\nRemarks.--_ We __ began with an animal Jataka, and may appropriately finish\nwith one which shows how effectively the writers of the Jatakas could\nrepresent animal folk, and how terribly moral they invariably were in their\ntales. I should perhaps add that the Bodhisat is not precisely the Buddha\nhimself but a character which is on its way to becoming perfectly enlightened,\nand so may be called a future Buddha.\n\n'
