Narayanasvami Aiyar, [1914], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 41\n\n### SKAN\xe1\xb8\x8cA 1-UPANISHA\xe1\xb8\x8c\n\n### OF\n\n### K\xe1\xb9\x9aSH\xe1\xb9\x86A-YAJURVE\xe1\xb8\x8cA\n\nOm. O Mah\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8deva (Lord of \xe1\xb8\x8cevas), I am indestructible through a small portion of\nThy grace. I am replete with Vij\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na. I am \xc5\x9aiva (Bliss). What is higher than\nIt? Truth does not shine as such on account of the display of the anta\xe1\xb8\xa5kara\xe1\xb9\x87a\n(internal organs). Through the destruction of the anta\xe1\xb8\xa5kara\xe1\xb9\x87a, Hari abides as\nSamvi\xe1\xb9\xad (Consciousness) alone. As I also am of the form of Samvi\xe1\xb9\xad, I am without\nbirth. What is higher than It? All inert things being other (than \xc4\x80\xe1\xb9\xadm\xc4\x81) perish\nlike dream. That Achyu\xe1\xb9\xada (the indestructible or Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u), who is the seer of\nthe conscious and the inert, is of the form of J\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na. He only is Mah\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8deva. He\nonly is Mah\xc4\x81-Hari (Mah\xc4\x81vish\xe1\xb9\x87u). He only is the Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis of all Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis (or Light\nof all lights). He only is Parame\xc5\x9bvara. He only is Parabrahman. That Brahman I\nam. There is no doubt (about it). J\xc4\xabva is \xc5\x9aiva. \xc5\x9aiva is J\xc4\xabva. That J\xc4\xabva is\n\xc5\x9aiva alone. Bound by husk, it is paddy; freed from husk, it is rice. In like\nmanner J\xc4\xabva is bound (by karma). If karma perishes, he (J\xc4\xabva) is Sa\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xc5\x9biva. So\nlong as he is bound by the bonds of karma, he is J\xc4\xabva. If freed from its\nbonds, then he is Sa\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xc5\x9biva. Prostrations on account of \xc5\x9aiva who is of the form\nof Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u, and on account of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u who is of the form of \xc5\x9aiva. The heart of\nVish\xe1\xb9\x87u is \xc5\x9aiva. The heart of \xc5\x9aiva is Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u. As I see no difference 2 (between\nthese two), therefore to me are prosperity and life. There is no difference--\nbetween \xc5\x9aiva and\n\np. 42\n\n[paragraph continues] Ke\xc5\x9bava (Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u). The body is said to be the divine\ntemple. The \xc5\x9aiva (in the body) is the God Sa\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81\xc5\x9biva 1 (in the temple).\n\nHaving given up the cast-off offerings of aj\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na, one should worship Him with\nthe thought "I am He". To see (oneself) as not different (from Him) is (j\xc3\xb1\xc4\x81na)\nwisdom. To make the mind free from sensual objects is \xe1\xb8\x8dhy\xc4\x81na (meditation). The\ngiving up of the stains of the mind is sn\xc4\x81na (bathing). The subjugation of the\nsenses is \xc5\x9boucha (cleansing). The nectar of Brahman should be drunk. For the\nupkeep of the body, one should go about for alms and eat. He should dwell\nalone in a solitary place without a second. He should be with the sole thought\nof the non-dual One. The wise person who conducts himself thus, attains\nsalvation. Prostrations on account of \xc5\x9ar\xc4\xabma\xe1\xb9\xad Param-Jyo\xe1\xb9\xadis (Supreme Light)\nabode! May prosperity and long life attend (me). O Narasimha! 2 O Lord of\n\xe1\xb8\x8cevas! through Thy grace, persons cognize the true nature of Brahman that is\nunthinkable, undifferentiated, endless, and immutable, through the forms of\nthe Gods, Brahma, N\xc4\x81r\xc4\x81ya\xe1\xb9\x87a, and \xc5\x9aa\xe1\xb9\x85kara.\n\nLike the eye (which sees without any obstacle the things) spread in the \xc4\x81k\xc4\x81\xc5\x9b,\nso the wise always see the supreme abode of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u. Brahmans with divine eyes\nwho are always spiritually awake, praise in diverse ways and illuminate the\nsupreme abode of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u. Thus is the teaching of the Ve\xe1\xb8\x8das for salvation.\n\nThus is the Upanisha\xe1\xb8\x8d.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[41:1](tmu10.htm#fr_15) Skan\xe1\xb8\x8da is the son of \xc5\x9aiva and is represented on earth\nby Sana\xe1\xb9\xadkum\xc4\x81ra.\n\n[41:2](tmu10.htm#fr_16) This will give a rude shock to the followers of \xc5\x9aiva\nand Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u in India, who, wage useless war as to the supremacy of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u and\n\xc5\x9aiva.\n\n[42:1](tmu10.htm#fr_17) Sa\xe1\xb8\x8d\xc4\x81siva, lit., eternal bliss. This is one of the\nnames applied to \xc5\x9aiva as also Mah\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8deva.\n\n[42:2](tmu10.htm#fr_18) Narasimha, lit., Man-lion. This refers to one of the\nincarnations of Vish\xe1\xb9\x87u when he killed the evil power Hira\xe1\xb9\x87yakasipu.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 9.
