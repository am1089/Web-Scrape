[1b](ry318.htm#fn_743)  \nStill on your forward journey keep,  \nAnd rest you by the northern deep,  \nWhere springing from the billows high  \nMount Somagiri  [2b](ry318.htm#fn_744) seeks the sky,  \nAnd lightens with perpetual glow  \nThe sunless realm that lies below.  \nThere, present through all life's extent,  \nDwells Brahma Lord preeminent,  \nAnd round the great God, manifest  \nIn Rudra  [3b](ry318.htm#fn_745) forms high sages rest.  \nThen turn, O Vanarsrch no more,  \nNor tempt the sunless, boundless shore.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[377:1b](ry316.htm#fr_732) One of the oldest and mightiest of the Vedic\ndeities; in later mythology regard ed as the God of the sea.\n\n[377:2b](ry316.htm#fr_733) The knotted noose with which he seizes and punishes\ntransgressors.\n\n[377:3b](ry316.htm#fr_734) Savarni Manu, Manuspring of the Sun by Chhaya.\n\n[377:4b](ry317.htm#fr_735) The poet has not said who the sons of Yama are.\n\n[377:5b](ry317.htm#fr_736) The Lodhra or Lodh (Symplocoa Racemosa) and the\nDevadarueodaDeodar are well known trees.\n\n[378:1](ry317.htm#fr_737) The hills mentioned are not identifiable.
