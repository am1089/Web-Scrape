Charm for the restoration of an exiled king.\n\n1\\. (Agni) has shouted loud: may he here well perform his work! Spread thyself\nout, O Agni, over the far-reaching hemispheres of the world! The all-\npossessing Maruts shall engage thee: bring hither that (king) who devoutly\nspends the offering!  \n2\\. However far he be, the red (steeds) shall urge hither Indra, the seer, to\nfriendship, since the gods, (chanting) for him the gayatri, the brihati, and\nthe arka (songs), infused courage into him with the sautramani-sacrifice!  \n3\\. From the waters king Varuna shall call thee, Soma shall call thee from the\nmountains, Indra shall cite thee to these clans! Turn into an eagle and fly to\nthese clans!  \n4\\. An eagle shall bring hither from a distance him that is fit to be called,\n(yet) wanders exiled in a strange land! The Asvins shall prepare for thee a\npath, easy to travel! Do ye, his kinfolk, gather close about him!  \n5\\. Thy opponents shall call thee; thy friends have chosen. thee! Indra, Agni,\nand all the gods have kept prosperity with this people.  \n6\\. The kinsman or the stranger that opposes thy call, him, O Indra, drive\naway; then render this (king) accepted here!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4. Prayer at the election of a king](av137.htm)\n\n'
