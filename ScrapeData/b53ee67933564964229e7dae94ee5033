If he desires (to perform) very great austerities, he (shall not make a\nhoard of grain, but) collect food every day only, morning and evening, in his\nvessel. 1\n\n2\\. Afterwards he shall wander about, sustaining his life with roots, fruits,\nleaves, and grass (which he 2\n\np. 158\n\ncollects). Finally (he shall content himself with) what has become detached\nspontaneously. Then he shall live on water, then on air, (and finally) upon\nether. Each succeeding mode of subsistence procures greater rewards.\n\n3\\. Now they quote (the following) two verses from a Pura _n_ a: 3\n\n4\\. Those eighty thousand sages who desired offspring passed to the south by\nAryaman\'s road and obtained burial-grounds. 4\n\n5\\. Those eighty thousand sages who desired no offspring passed by Aryaman\'s\nroad to the north and obtained immortality.\n\n6\\. Thus are praised those who keep the vow of chastity.\n\n7\\. Now they accomplish also their wishes merely by conceiving them,\n\n8\\. For instance, (the desire to procure) rain, to bestow children, second-\nsight, to move quick as thought, and other (desires) of this description.\n\n9\\. Therefore on account of (passages) of the revealed texts, and on account\nof the visible results, some declare these orders (of men keeping the vow of\nchastity to be) the most excellent.\n\n10\\. But (to this we answer): It is the firm opinion of those who are well\nversed in the threefold sacred learning, that the Vedas are the highest\nauthority.\n\np. 159\n\n[paragraph continues] They consider that the (rites) which are ordered there\nto be performed with rice, yava, animals, clarified butter, milk, potsherds,\n(in conjunction) with a wife, (and accompanied) by loud or muttered (Mantras),\nmust be performed, and that (hence) a rule of conduct which is opposed to\nthese (rites) is of no authority.\n\n11\\. But by the term burial-ground (in the text above given) it is intended to\nordain the last rites for those who have performed many sacrifices, (and not\nto mean that dead householders become demons and haunt burial-grounds.) 11\n\n12\\. The revealed texts declare that after (the burial follows) a reward\nwithout end, which is designated by the term \'heavenly bliss.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[157:1](sbe0258.htm#fr_742) **23**. The following rules apply to a solitary\nhermit.\n\n[157:2](sbe0258.htm#fr_743) These Sutras are repeated in order to show that,\naccording to, the opinion of those who allow hermits to live with their\nfamilies, the end should be the same.\n\n[158:3](sbe0258.htm#fr_744) \'The "orders" have been described. Now, giving\nconflicting opinions, he discusses which of them is the most important.\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[158:4](sbe0258.htm#fr_745) This verse and the next are intended to disparage\nthe order of householders. Haradatta explains \'burial-grounds\' by \'new births\nwhich lead to new deaths;\' but see below, Sutra 10. See also Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_. III,\n186-187.\n\n[159:11](sbe0258.htm#fr_746) The Sutra is intended to remove the blame thrown\non the order of householders by the verse quoted. Haradatta seems to have\nforgotten his former explanation of _S_ ma _s_ anani.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Pra _s_ na II, Pa _t_ ala 9, Kha _n_ _d_ a 24](sbe0259.htm)\n\n'
