(The Self whose true nature has manifested itself is) released; according\nto the promise (made by scripture).\n\nThat soul, of which the text says that it manifests itself, is released from\nits former bondage and abides in its own pure Self; while previously its Self\nwas stained by the three states (i.e. the state of waking, dreaming, and\ndreamless sleep), according to _Kh_. Up. VIII, 9-11, 'It is blind;'--'it weeps\nas it were;'--'it goes to utter annihilation.' This is the difference.--But\nhow is it known that in its present condition the soul is released?--'On\naccount of the promise,' the Sutra says. For after the teacher has promised to\ngive further instruction about the Self as free from the imperfections of the\nthree states ('I shall explain him further to you,' _Kh_. Up. VIII, 11, 3), he\nintroduces the topic (of the released Self) in the words, 'Him being free from\nthe body neither pleasure nor pain touches,' and concludes, 'By his own nature\nhe manifests himself; that is the highest Person.' The words at the beginning\nof the tale also, 'The Self which is free from sin' (VIII, 7, 1), make a\npromise regarding the released Self. And release is a fruit in so far only as\nit is a cessation of all bondage, not as implying the accession of something\nnew. And with reference to the assertion that manifestation is the origination\nof something new we remark that it is so only with regard to a former\ncondition (which ceases to be), as when we say of a convalescent person that\nhe now manifests\n\np. 407\n\nhimself free from sickness. Hence there is no room for objections.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 3](sbe38320.htm)\n\n"
