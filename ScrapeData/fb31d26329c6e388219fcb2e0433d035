Now with reference to the body. _Ri_ _k_ is speech, Saman breath 2. This\nSaman (breath) rests on that _Ri_ _k_ (speech). Therefore the Saman is sung as\nresting on the _Ri_ _k_. Sa is speech, ama is breath, and that makes Sama.\n\n2\\. _Ri_ _k_ is the eye, Saman the self 3. This Saman (shadow) rests on that\n_Ri_ _k_ (eye). Therefore the Saman is sung as resting on the _Ri_ _k_. Sa is\nthe eye, ama the self, and that makes Sama.\n\n3\\. _Ri_ _k_ is the ear, Saman the mind. This Saman (mind) rests on that _Ri_\n_k_ (ear). Therefore the Saman is sung as resting on the _Ri_ _k_. Sa is the\near, ama the mind, and that makes Sama.\n\n4\\. _Ri_ _k_ is the white light of the eye, Saman the blue exceeding darkness.\nThis Saman (darkness) rests on the _Ri_ _k_ (brightness). Therefore the Saman\nis sung as resting on the _Ri_ _k_. Sa is the white light of the eye, ama the\nblue exceeding darkness, and that makes Sama.\n\n5\\. Now the person who is seen in the eye, he is _Ri_ _k_ , he is Saman, Uktha\n4, Ya _g_ us, Brahman. The form of that person (in the eye) is the same 5 as\nthe\n\np. 15\n\nform of the other person (in the sun), the joints of the one ( _Ri_ _k_ and\nSaman) are the joints of the other, the name of the one (ut) is the name of\nthe other.\n\n6\\. He is lord of the worlds beneath that (the self in the eye), and of all\nthe wishes of men. Therefore all who sing to the vi _n_ a (lyre), sing him,\nand from him also they obtain wealth.\n\n7\\. He who knowing this sings a Saman, sings to both (the adhidaivata and\nadhyatma self, the person in the sun and the person in the eye, as one and the\nsame person). He obtains through the one, yea, he obtains the worlds beyond\nthat, and the wishes of the Devas;\n\n8\\. And he obtains through the other the worlds beneath that, and the wishes\nof men.\n\nTherefore an Udgat _ri_ priest who knows this, may say (to the sacrificer for\nwhom he officiates);\n\n9\\. 'What wish shall I obtain for you by my songs?' For he who knowing this\nsings a Saman is able to obtain wishes through his song, yea, through his\nsong.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[14:2](sbe01028.htm#fr_101) Breath in the nose, sense of smelling.
