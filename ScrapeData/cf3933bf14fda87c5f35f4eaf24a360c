Afterwards, having given a great many presents to\nBrahmins, he allowed them to depart; and having arrayed his relations in\ndresses, which he gave them, entertained them with every sort of delicacy. At\nthis time, Jusodha was assisting in the ceremony of serving the food, Rohnee\nwas waiting upon them, the inhabitants of Bruj were laughing and eating, the\ncowherdesses were singing songs; all were so delighted with joy, that not one\nthought about Krishnu; and Krishnu was fast asleep in a cradle under a heavy\ncart. Shortly afterwards, he awoke hungry; having his toe in his mouth, he\nbegan crying, and moving about to look around him. At that time, a demon came\nflying over. Seeing Krishnu alone, he began to say to himself, "This is some\nvery powerful person that has been born; but to-day I will revenge myself on\nhim for Pootna\'s death."\n\np. 35\n\nHaving resolved upon this, he came and sat in the cart, whence his name was\nSuktasoor. When the cart began to crack, and move about, Shree Krishnu,\nsobbing, gave such a kick, that the demon died, and the cart fell to pieces.\nAs many pails as there were, containing milk and curds, were all broken, and\nthe contents oozed out; and the buttermilk flowed in a stream, like a river.\nHearing the noise of the cart going to pieces, and of the breaking of the\nearthen pots, all the cowherdesses and cowherds ran to the spot. On arrival,\nJusodha taking up Krishnu, and kissing him, pressed him to her bosom.\n\nHaving beheld this strange occurrence, they all began to say to each other\n"Bruhmu has done an act of great kindness to-day, by means of which, although\nthe cart has been broken in pieces, the child has escaped."\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo said,--Raja! when Huri was five\nmonths old, Kuns sent Trinawurut, who came to Gokool in the form of a\nwhirlwind.\n\nNund\'s wife was sitting with Krishnu in her lap in the court-yard, when all at\nonce Krishnu became so heavy, that Jusodha, on account of the weight, was\nobliged to let him down from her lap. In the meantime, such a violent storm\noccurred, that day was changed into night, and trees began to fall, torn up by\nthe roots; the roofs of houses to fly about. Upon this Jusodha, being alarmed,\ntried to lift up Krishnu, but he would not rise. As soon as her hand was off\nhis body, Trinawurut flew off with him in the air, and began to say to\nhimself, "To-day I will most certainly destroy him."\n\nHaving taken off Krishnu, the demon was resolving these thoughts in his mind,\nwhilst Jusodha, not knowing where Krishnu was, (lit: not seeing him before\nher,) began to cry, and to call out "Krishnu! Krishnu!" Hearing her voice, all\nthe cowherdesses and cowherds came to the spot, and, together with her, ran\nabout in search of Krishnu\\--They went about groping in the dark by guess--and\ntripped, and fell down.\n\np. 36\n\nThe cowherdesses roamed over the jungle of Bruj in search of Krishnu, whilst\nRohnee and Jusodha were talking to each other about him, Nund continued\ncalling out in a voice of thunder; the cowherdesses and cowherds vociferated\nlustily. When Shree Krishnu saw that Nund and Jusodha, as well as all the\ninhabitants of Bruj, were much distressed; having twisted Trinawurut round,\nand brought him into the court-yard, he dashed him against a stone with such\nviolence, that life left his body. The storm was hushed; it became light\nagain; and all, after having lost their road, reached home. They saw a demon\nlying dead in the court yard; Shree Krishnu was playing upon his chest. On\ncoming up to him, Jusodha took him in his arms, and clasped him to her bosom,\nand gave many gifts to Brahmins.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IX](psa10.htm)\n\n'
