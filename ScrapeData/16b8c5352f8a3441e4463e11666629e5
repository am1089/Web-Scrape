Let him never turn away (a stranger) from his house, that is the rule.\nTherefore a man should by all means acquire much food, for (good) people say\n(to the stranger): 'There is food ready for him.' If he gives food amply, food\nis given to him amply. If he gives food fairly, food is given to him fairly.\nIf he gives food meanly, food is given to him meanly.\n\n2\\. He who knows this, (recognises and worships Brahman 2) as possession in\nspeech, as acquisition and possession in up-breathing (pra _n_ a) and down-\nbreathing (apana); as action in the hands; as walking in the feet; as voiding\nin the anus. These are the human recognitions (of Brahman as manifested in\nhuman actions). Next follow the recognitions (of\n\np. 68\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahman) with reference to the Devas, viz. as\nsatisfaction in rain; as power in lightning;\n\n3\\. As glory in cattle; as light in the stars; as procreation, immortality,\nand bliss in the member; as everything in the ether. Let him worship that\n(Brahman) as support, and he becomes supported. Let him worship that (Brahman)\nas greatness (maha _h_ ), and he becomes great. Let him worship that (Brahman)\nas mind, and he becomes endowed with mind.\n\n4\\. Let him worship that (Brahman) as adoration, and all desires fall down\nbefore him in adoration. Let him worship that (Brahman) as Brahman, and he\nwill become possessed of Brahman. Let him worship this as the absorption of\nthe gods 1 in Brahman, and the enemies who hate him will die all around him,\nall around him will die the foes whom he does not love.\n\nHe 2 who is this (Brahman) in man, and he who is that (Brahman) in the sun,\nboth are one.\n\n5\\. He who knows this, when he has departed this world, after reaching and\ncomprehending the Self which consists of food, the Self which consists of\nbreath, the Self which consists of mind, the Self which consists of\nunderstanding, the Self which consists of bliss, enters and takes possession\nof these worlds, and having as much food as he likes, and assuming as many\nforms as he likes, he sits down singing this Saman (of Brahman): 'Havu, havu,\nhavu!\n\np. 69\n\n6\\. 'I am food (object), I am food, I am food! I am the eater of food\n(subject), I am the eater of food, I am the eater of food! I am the poet (who\njoins the two together), I am the poet, I am the poet! I am the first-born of\nthe Right ( _ri_ ta). Before the Devas I was in the centre of all that is\nimmortal. He who gives me away, he alone preserves me: him who eats food, I\neat as food.\n\n'I overcome the whole world, I, endowed with golden light 1. He who knows\nthis, (attains all this).' This is the Upanishad 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[67:2](sbe15052.htm#fr_241) Brahma _n_ a upasanaprakatra _h_.\n\n[68:1](sbe15052.htm#fr_242) Cf. Kaush. Up. II, 12.
