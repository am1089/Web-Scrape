Then Sauryaya _n_ in Gargya asked: 'Sir, What are they that sleep in this\nman, and what are they that are awake in him? What power (deva) is it that\nsees dreams? Whose is the happiness? On what do all these depend?'\n\n2\\. He replied: 'O Gargya, As all the rays of the sun, when it sets, are\ngathered up in that disc of light, and as they, when the sun rises again and\nagain, come forth, so is all this (all the senses) gathered up in the highest\nfaculty (deva) 1, the mind. Therefore at that time that man does not hear,\nsee, smell, taste, touch, he does not speak, he does not take, does not enjoy,\ndoes not evacuate, does not move about. He sleeps, that is what people say.\n\n3\\. The fires of the pra _n_ as are, as it were 2, awake in that town (the\nbody). The Apana is the Garhapatya fire, the Vyana the Anvaharyapa _k_ ana\nfire; and because it is taken out of the Garhapatya fire, which is fire for\ntaking out 3, therefore the Pra _n_ a is the \xc3\x82havaniya fire 4.\n\nNow the Apana is identified with the Garhapatya fire, no reason being given\nexcept afterwards, when it is said that the Pra _n_ a is the \xc3\x82havaniya fire,\nbeing taken out of the Garhapatya, here called p. 280 pra _n_ ayana, in the\nsame manner as the pra _n_ a proceeds in sleep from the apana. The Vyana is\nidentified with the Dakshi _n_ agni, the Southern fire, because it issues from\nthe heart through an aperture on the right.\n\np. 280\n\n4\\. Because it carries equally these two oblations, the out-breathing and the\nin-breathing, the Samana is he (the Hot _ri_ priest) 1. The mind is the\nsacrificer, the Udana is the reward of the sacrifice, and it leads the\nsacrificer every day (in deep sleep) to Brahman.\n\n5\\. There that god 2 (the mind) enjoys in sleep greatness. What has been seen,\nhe 2 sees again; what has been heard, he hears again; what has been enjoyed in\ndifferent countries and quarters, he enjoys again; what has been seen and not\nseen, heard and not heard, enjoyed and not enjoyed, he sees it all; he, being\nall, sees.\n\n6\\. And when he is overpowered by light 3, then that god sees no dreams, and\nat that time that happiness arises in his body.\n\n7\\. And, O friend, as birds go to a tree to roost, thus all this rests in the\nHighest \xc3\x82tman,--\n\n8\\. The earth and its subtile elements, the water and its subtile elements,\nthe light and its subtile elements, the air and its subtile elements, the\nether and its subtile elements; the eye and what can be\n\np. 281\n\nseen, the ear and what can be heard, the nose and what can be smelled, the\ntaste and what can be tasted, the skin and what can be touched, the voice and\nwhat can be spoken, the hands and what can be grasped, the feet and what can\nbe walked, the mind and what can be perceived, intellect (buddhi) and what can\nbe conceived, personality and what can be personified, thought and what can be\nthought, light and what can be lighted up, the Pra _n_ a and what is to be\nsupported by it.\n\n9\\. For he it is who sees, hears, smells, tastes, perceives, conceives, acts,\nhe whose essence is knowledge 1, the person, and he dwells in the highest,\nindestructible Self,--\n\n10\\. He who knows that indestructible being, obtains (what is) the highest and\nindestructible, he without a shadow, without a body, without colour,\nbright--,yes, O friend, he who knows it, becomes all-knowing, becomes all. On\nthis there is this _S_ loka:\n\n11\\. He, O friend, who knows that indestructible being wherein the true\nknower, the vital spirits (pra _n_ as), together with all the powers (deva),\nand the elements rest, he, being all-knowing, has penetrated all.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[279:1](sbe15109.htm#fr_902) See note to verse 5.\n\n[279:2](sbe15109.htm#fr_903) We ought to read agnaya iva.\n\n[279:3](sbe15109.htm#fr_904) Pra _n_ ayana, pra _n_ iyate 'smad iti pra _n_\nayano garhapatyo 'gni _h_.\n\n[279:4](sbe15109.htm#fr_905) The comparison between the pra _n_ as and the\nfires or altars is not very clear. As to the fires or altars, there is the\nGarhapatya, placed in the South-west, the household fire, which is always kept\nburning, from which the fire is taken to the other altars. The Anvaharyapa _k_\nana, commonly called the Dakshi _n_ a fire, placed in the South, used chiefly\nfor oblations to the forefathers. The \xc3\x82havaniya fire, placed in the East, and\nused for sacrifices to the gods.\n\n[280:1](sbe15109.htm#fr_906) The name of the Hot _ri_ priest must be supplied.\nHe is supposed to carry two oblations equally to the \xc3\x82havaniya, and in the\nsame way the Vyana, combines the two breathings, the in and out breathings.\n\n[280:2](sbe15109.htm#fr_908) The _g_ ivatman under the guise of manas. The\nSanskrit word is deva, god, used in the sense of an invisible power, but as a\nmasculine. The commentator uses manodeva _h_ , p. 212, l. 5. I generally\ntranslate deva, if used in this sense, by faculty, but the context required a\nmasculine. See verse 2.\n\n[280:3](sbe15109.htm#fr_909) In the state of profound sleep or sushupti.\n\n[281:1](sbe15109.htm#fr_910) Buddhi and the rest are the instruments of\nknowledge, but there is the knower, the person, in the Highest Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fifth Question](sbe15110.htm)\n\n"
