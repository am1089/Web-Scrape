Ether (is Brahman), on account of the characteristic marks.\n\nWe read in the _Kh_ andogya (I, 9), 'What is the origin of this world?'\n'Ether,' he replied. 'For all these beings spring from the ether only, and\nreturn into the ether. Ether is greater than these; ether is their rest.' Here\nthere arises the doubt whether the word 'ether' denotes\n\np. 243\n\nthe well-known element or Brahman.--The Purvapakshin maintains the former\nalternative. For, he says, in the case of things to be apprehended through\nwords we must accept that sense of the word which, proved by etymology, is\nimmediately suggested by the word. We therefore conclude from the passage that\nthe well-known Ether is the cause of the entire aggregate of things, moving or\nnon-moving, and that hence Brahman is the same as Ether.--But has it not been\nshown that Brahman is something different from non-sentient things because its\ncreative activity is preceded by thought?--This has been asserted indeed, but\nby no means proved. For the proper way to combine the different texts is as\nfollows. Having been told that 'that from which these beings are born is\nBrahman', we desire to know more especially what that source of all beings is,\nand this desire is satisfied by the special information given by the text,\n'All these things spring from the ether.' It thus being ascertained that the\nether only is the cause of the origin, and so on, of the world, we conclude\nthat also such general terms as 'Being' ('Being only was this in the\nbeginning') denote the particular substance called 'ether.' And we further\nconclude that in passages such as 'the Self only was all this in the\nbeginning', the word 'Self (atman) also denotes the ether; for that word is by\nno means limited to non-sentient things--cp., e.g., the phrase, 'Clay\nconstitutes the Self of the jar'--, and its etymology also (atman from ap, to\nreach) shows that it may very well be applied to the ether. It having thus\nbeen ascertained that the ether is the general cause or Brahman, we must\ninterpret such words as 'thinking' (which we meet with in connexion with the\ncreative activity of the general cause) in a suitable, i.e. secondary, or\nmetaphorical sense. If the texts denoted the general cause by general terms\nonly, such as 'Being', we should, in agreement with the primary sense of\n'thinking', and similar terms, decide that that cause is an intelligent being;\nbut since, as a matter of fact, we ascertain a particular cause on the basis\nof the word 'ether', our decision cannot be formed on general considerations\nof what would suit the sense.--But what then\n\np. 244\n\nabout the passage, 'From the Self there sprang the ether' (Taitt. Up. II, 1,\n1), from which it appears that the ether itself is something created?--All\nelementary substances, we reply, such as ether, air, and so on, have two\ndifferent states, a gross material one, and a subtle one. The ether, in its\nsubtle state, is the universal cause; in its gross state it is an effect of\nthe primal cause; in its gross state it thus springs from itself, i.e. ether\nin the subtle state. The text, 'All these beings spring from ether only' (\n_Kh_. Up. I, 9, 1), declares that the whole world originates from ether only,\nand from this it follows that ether is none other than the general cause of\nthe world, i.e. Brahman. This non-difference of Brahman from the empirically\nknown ether also gives a satisfactory sense to texts such as the following:\n'If this ether were not bliss' (Taitt. Up. II, 7, 1); 'Ether, indeed, is the\nevolver of names and forms' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 14, 1, and so on).--It thus\nappears that Brahman is none other than the well-known elemental ether.\n\nThis prima facie view is set aside by the Sutra. The word 'ether' in the text\nunder discussion denotes the highest Self with its previously established\ncharacteristics--which is something quite different from the non-sentient\nelemental ether. For the qualities which the passage attributes to ether, viz.\nits being the one cause of the entire world, its being greater than all, and\nthe rest of all, clearly indicate the highest Self. The non-intelligent\nelemental ether cannot be called the cause of all, since intelligent beings\nclearly cannot be its effects; nor can it be called the 'rest' of intelligent\nbeings, for non-sentient things are evil and antagonistic to the true aim of\nman; nor can it be called 'greater' than all, for it is impossible that a non-\nsentient element should possess all excellent qualities whatever and thus be\nabsolutely superior to everything else.--Nor is the Purvapakshin right when\nmaintaining that, as the word 'ether' satisfies the demand for a special cause\nof the world, all other texts are to be interpreted in accordance herewith.\nThe words, 'All these beings indeed spring from the ether only,' merely give\nexpression to something generally known, and statements of this nature\npresuppose other\n\np. 245\n\nmeans of knowledge to prove them. Now these other means required are, in our\ncase, supplied by such texts as 'Being only was this in the beginning,' and\nthese, as we have shown, establish the existence of Brahman. To Brahman thus\nestablished, the text mentioning the ether merely refers as to something well\nknown. Brahman may suitably be called 'ether' (aka _s_ a), because being of\nthe nature of light it shines (aka _s_ ate) itself, and makes other things\nshine forth (aka _s_ ayati). Moreover, the word 'ether' is indeed capable of\nconveying the idea of a special being (as cause), but as it denotes a special\nnon-intelligent thing which cannot be admitted as the cause of the intelligent\npart of the world we must deny all authoritativeness to the attempt to tamper,\nin the interest of that one word, with the sense of other texts which have the\npower of giving instruction as to an entirely new thing (viz. Brahman),\ndistinguished by the possession of omniscience, the power of realising its\npurposes and similar attributes, which we ascertain from certain complementary\ntexts-such as 'it thought, may I be many, may I grow forth,' and 'it desired,\nmay I be many, may I grow forth.' We also point out that the agreement in\npurport of a number of texts capable of establishing the existence of a\nwonderful being possessing infinite wonderful attributes is not lightly to be\ndisregarded in favour of one single text vhich moreover (has not the power of\nintimating something not known before, but) only makes a reference to what is\nalready established by other texts.--As to the averment that the word 'Self'\nis not exclusively limited to sentient beings, we remark that that word is\nindeed applied occasionally to non-sentient things, but prevailingly to that\nwhich is the correlative of a body, i.e. the soul or spirit; in texts such as\n'the Self only was this in the beginning,' and 'from the Self there sprang the\nether,' we must therefore understand by the 'Self,' the universal spirit. The\ndenotative power of the term 'atman,' which is thus proved by itself, is\nmoreover confirmed by the complementary passages 'it desired, may I send forth\nthe worlds', 'it desired, may I be many, may I grow forth.'--We thus\n\np. 246\n\narrive at the following conclusion: Brahman, which--by the passage 'Being only\nthis was in the beginning'--is established as the sole cause of the world,\npossessing all those manifold wonderful attributes which are ascertained from\nthe complementary passages, is, in the text under discussion, referred to as\nsomething already known, by means of the term 'ether.'--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of' ether.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 24.
