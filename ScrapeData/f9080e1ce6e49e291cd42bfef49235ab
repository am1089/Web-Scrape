Vyasa said :-- O king! Hear in detail the complete life and the deeds in\nthe incarnation of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a and also the various wonderful achievements\nby the Goddess of this universe.\n\n\n\n2\\. Once on a time, the Earth was very much overburdened by the load of wicked\nkings and She was therefore very much afraid.\n\n\n\n3\\. She then assumed the appearance of a cow and went to the Devaloka crying\nand very much dejected.\n\n\n\nIndra, the lord of the Devas, asked her, O Vasundhare! What is the cause of\nyour fear now? Who has troubled you? What afflictions are you merged in?\nPlease tell me all these.\n\n\n\n4\\. On hearing Indra\xc2\x92s words, the Earth exclaimed :-- O Respect giver! When\nYou have asked me, I am explaining to you the cause of all my afflictions and\nsorrows; at present I am overburdened with too much load.\n\n\n\np. 315\n\n\n\n5-8. Now is reigning in the earth Jarasandha, the king of Magadha, a very very\nvicious person. Thus the other S\xc2\x92is\xc2\x92upal, the lord of the Chedis, the\nuncontrollable Kas\xc2\x92iraj, Rukmi, the powerful Kamsa, the strong Naraka, the\nSauvapati S\xc2\x92alva, the wicked Kes\xc2\x92i, Dhenuka, and Batsaka all these are now in\nroyal positions. O Lord of the Devas! These kings are all devoid of the least\ntrace of virtue, quarrelsome against each other, infatuated with vanity, and\naddicted to vicious deeds. These have become kings as if they were personified\nYamas, the Lords of Death, and are constantly troubling me. I am now unable to\ncarry their loads; where shall I go now? This great thought is constantly\nailing me.\n\n\n\n9-11. O Vasava! What to tell! The Bhagavan in His Boar Incarnation is the\ncause of all these my afflictions; O Indra! These present troubles I am fallen\ninto only through Him; for when the cruel Daitya Hiranyak _s_ a; the son of\nKa\xc2\x92syapa stole me away and drowned me in the great ocean, then it was Vi _sn_\nu in his Boar incarnation that killed him and rescued me from the ocean and\nthen kept me in this my stable position.\n\n\n\n12\\. Had he not then lifted me up, I would have rested safe in the depths of\nRasatala; O Lord of the Devas! Now I am quite unable to bear the load of these\nvicious persons.\n\n\n\n13\\. O Surendra! The vicious twenty eight Kali is coming quickly in front.\nThinking of His influence, it seems to me that I will be very troubled then\nand will have to go down to Rasatala.\n\n\n\n14\\. Therefore, O Lord of the Devas! I am bowing down before Your feet, kindly\nrelieve me of my burden and save me from these endless troubles.\n\n\n\n15\\. Indra said :-- O Earth! I cannot do anything for you. You better go and\ntake refuge of Brahma. I am also going to Him. He will remove all your\ntroubles.\n\n\n\n16\\. Hearing Indra\xc2\x92s words the Earth hurriedly went to the realm of Brahma and\nIndra and all the other Devas followed Her; and all reached the Brahmaloka.\n\n\n\n17-18. O King! The Grand Father Brahma saw the Earth coming to him and through\nthe power of meditation, found out the cause of Her coming and said :-- O\nAuspicious One! why are You crying? What troubles You have now? What wicked\nperson has given You troubles.\n\n\n\n19\\. The Earth said :-- O Lord of the Earth! The vicious Kali is coming\nbefore; under Its influence the subjects will be horribly vicious; therefore I\nam very much afraid of this Kali.\n\n\n\np. 316\n\n\n\n20\\. In the beginning of this Kali Yuga, the ancient enemies, the Asuras have\nnow incarnated on this earth as kings. They will be extremely wicked,\nquarreling against each other, and will be clever in stealing others\xc2\x92 things.\nThere is no doubt in these.\n\n\n\n21\\. O Grand Father! Now kill these vicious kings and relieve my burden. O\nLord! I am very much troubled by the armies of these kings.\n\n\n\n22\\. Brahma said :-- O Goddess! I, too, am unable like Indra to remove your\nload. Let us go to that Vi _sn_ u, the Holder of the disc.\n\n\n\n23\\. That Janardana will remove your burden. I thought of this well before and\nsettled what to do.\n\n\n\n24-25. Vyasa said :-- Thus saying, the four faced Brahma, the Author of the\nVedas, rode on His Hamsa Vehicle taking in front the Goddess Earth; and the\nDevas went to Vi _sn_ u and began to praise Vi _sn_ u Janardana, the Deva of\nthe Devas, with the words of the Vedas with full devotion.\n\n\n\n26\\. Brahma said :-- Thou hast thousand heads, thousand faces, thousand feet.\nThou art the Puru _s_ a of the Vedas, Thou art the Deva of the Devas, and Thou\nart Eternal.\n\n\n\n27\\. O Omnipresent! Thou art the Past, Present, and Future! O Lord of Lak _s_\nmi! Thou hast awarded immortality unto us.\n\n\n\n28\\. Thou art the Creator of universe, the Preserver and the Destroyer; Thou\nart the One and the Only goal and thou art the God. Everybody knows that all\nthese glories belong to Thee.\n\n\n\n29\\. Vyasa said :-- O king! When Brahma praised thus, Vi _sn_ u whose sign was\nGaru _d_ a, was highly pleased and appeared before Brahma and the other Devas.\n\n\n\n30\\. The Bhagavan asked them about their welfare and enquired in detail into\nthe cause of their arrival there.\n\n\n\n31\\. Brahma them bowed down to Him and, remembering the cause of the sorrows\nof the Goddess Earth, said :-- O Lord! Thou art now to relieve the burden of\nthe Earth.\n\n\n\n32\\. O Thou, Ocean of mercy! When the end of the Dvapara yuga will come Thou\nart to incarnate in the world and kill the wicked kings and thus to relieve\nthe burden of the Earth.\n\n\n\n33-34. Vi _sn_ u said :-- I am not independent in these matters; why I? Brahma\nMahes\xc2\x92a, Indra, Agni, Yama, Visvakarma, the Sun and Varu _n_ a and other\nDevas, nobody is independent. This whole universe, moving and\n\n\n\np. 317\n\n\n\nunmoving is existing under the control of the Yoga Maya; and from Brahma up to\nthe clot of grass, all are strung into the thread of Her Three qualities.\n\n\n\n35\\. O One of good vows! Whatever that Yoga Maya, the Supreme Goddess, Who is\nAll will, Whose mouth is inward, Who does good at all times, what She wills\nShe does that at any time. You should all know that we are entirely under Her\ncontrol.\n\n\n\n36-41. You better think that were I independent, what for would I have stayed\nin the great ocean, incarnating in the Fish and Tortoise Bodies! O Brahmi _n_!\nWhat name or pleasure is there in enjoyment in the body of lower animals! What\nholy merit or any other reward may I expect from being born in the wombs of\nlower animals? What is the reason that I assume the body of a Boar? or of a\nMan-Lion? or of a Dwarf? Why was I born as the son of Jamadagni. Especially\nwhy did I, being born of that highsouled Brahma _n_ Jamadagni, and being the\nbest of the Brahmi _n_ s, do the most atrocious act like that of a heartless\nbrute and fill up the lakes with their blood. Alas! I killed the K _s_ atriyas\nmercilessly; to say nothing more than that I killed the sons that were then in\nthe wombs. Were I independent, what for I would have done these horrible and\ncruel deeds! O Lord of the Devas! See again. In my Rama incarnation I roamed\non foot, helpless and without any provision, in the fearful Da _nd_ aka forest\nunfrequented by anybody, wearing clotted hair, bark, rags, like a man who\nfeels no shame, and behaved like a hunter and killed many animals.\n\n\n\n42-44. Being under the delusion of Maya, I could not make out the real nature\nof the golden deer; consequently leaving Janaki in the thatched cottage, I\nwent out pursuing the deer. Though repeatedly warned by me not to leave the\nplace, Lak _s_ ma _n_ a was moved by the qualities of Prakriti, forsook her\nand went out on my search.\n\n\n\n45\\. Then the hypocrite Rava _n_ a, the king of the Rak _s_ asas, under the\ngarb of a beggar; stole away by force the daughter of Janaka, who had become\nvery lean on account of sorrows.\n\n\n\n46\\. I was very much distressed owing to the separation from my dear wife and\nroamed about weeping sorely in forest and formed friendship with Sugriva,\nunder the influence of the circumstances.\n\n\n\n47\\. It was an act of gross injustice on my part to kill Bali, the king of the\nmonkeys. I freed him from his curse; afterwards, aided by the monkeys, I had\nto go to Lanka.\n\n\n\n48\\. When my younger Lak _s_ ma _n_ a and myself were both enchained under the\nchain of the serpents, Nagapas\xc2\x92a, and were senseless, the monkeys all were\nastonished.\n\n\n\np. 318\n\n\n\n49\\. Then Garu _d_ a came and freed us the two brothers, from those\nNagapas\xc2\x92as! I considered then what adverse inauspicious circumstances Fate\nsometimes ordains on our lot.\n\n\n\n50\\. I lost my kingdom, lived in the forest, my father died, Janaki was stolen\nand I had to suffer extreme troubles in very deadly battles; I could not know\nwhat worse fate still awaited for us?\n\n\n\n51\\. O Suras! What more calamity can you expect to befall any person than that\nI was from the very first deprived of my kingdoms and wealth, and had to go to\nthe forest with the princess Sita dwelling in and taking shelter in a dense\nforest!\n\n\n\n52\\. At the time of my going to the forest my father did not give a single\npenny; penniless and helpless I had to get out of Ayodhya on foot.\n\n\n\n53\\. I was compelled to leave my K _s_ attriya Dharma and take up the\navocation of a hunter and thus to spend fourteen years in forest.\n\n\n\n54\\. After that, under the benign influence of Fate, I was able to kill that\nAsura Rava _n_ a and got the victory in the battle and was able to bring back\ndear Sita to Ayodhya.\n\n\n\n55\\. There I succeeded in becoming the ruler of the kingdom Kos\xc2\x92ala with its\nsubjects and got the full kingdom and enjoyed for a few years the pleasures of\nthe world.\n\n\n\n56-57. The stealing away of Sita took place at the first outset; next I got my\nkingdom; then the subjects began to circulate the bad name regarding Janaki;\nand I being afraid of that, deported her into exile in the forest. At that\ntime I had to suffer again extreme pain and agony due to the separation from\nmy wife. Then the daughter of the Goddess Earth penetrated into the Earth and\ngot down to the Patala.\n\n\n\n58\\. O Devas! When I had to depend on Fate and to suffer so many troubles\nincessantly, where else can you dare to say that an independent man exists.\n\n\n\n59\\. Afterwards under the influence of Time, I had to go to Heaven with my\nbrothers. Let all this point to what it may, the intelligent learned people\ncan say what an amount of mishaps takes place to one who is dependent!\n\n\n\n60\\. O One born from the Lotus! You hear my word; I am in every way dependent;\nwhy I? Rudra, You and all those Suras are fully dependent.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eighteenth Chapter of the Fourth Book of the Maha Pura _n_ am\nS\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa on the\nDevi Earth\xc2\x92s going to the Heavens.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 19](bk04ch19.htm)\n\n'
