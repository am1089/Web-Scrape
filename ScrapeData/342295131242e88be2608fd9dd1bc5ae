The Devi said :-- "O Giriraja! This whole universe, moving and unmoving,\nis created by My Maya S\'akti. This Maya is conceived in Me. It is not, in\nreality, different or separate from Me. So I am the only Chit, Intelligence.\nThere is no other intelligence than Me. Viewed practically, it is known\nvariously as Maya, Vidya; but viewed really from the point of Brahma _n_ ,\nthere is no such thing as Maya; only one Brahman exists, I am that Brahma, of\nthe nature of Intelligence.\n\np. 711\n\nI create this whole world on this Unchangeable Eternal (Mountain-like) Brahma,\n(composed of Avidya, Karma, and various Samskaras) and enter first as Pra _n_\na (vital breath) within it in the form of Chidabha _s_ a. O Mountain! Unless I\nenter as Breath, how can this birth and death and leaving and retaking bodies\nafter bodies be accounted for! As one great \xc3\x82kas\'a is denominated variously\nGha _t_ akas\'a (\xc3\x82kas\'a in the air), Pa _t_ akas\'a (\xc3\x82kas\'a in cloth or\npicture), so I too appear variously by acknowledging this Pra _n_ a in various\nplaces due to Avidya and various Anta _h_ kara _n_ as. As the Sun\'s rays are\nnever defiled when they illumine various objects on earth, so I, too, am not\ndefiled in entering thus into various high and low An _t_ ahkara _n_ as\n(hearts). The ignorant people attach Buddhi and other things of activity on Me\nand say that \xc3\x82tman is the Doer; the intelligent people do not say that. I\nremain as the Witness in the hearts of all men, not as the Doer. O Achalendra!\nThere are many Jivas and many \xc3\x8es\'varas due to the varieties in Avidya and\nVidya. Really it is Maya that differentiates into men, beasts and various\nother Jivas; and it is Maya that differentiates into Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and\nother \xc3\x8es\'varas. As the one pervading sky (\xc3\x82kas\'a) is called Mahakas\'a Gha _t_\nakas\'a (being enclosed by jars), so the One All pervading Paramatma is called\nParamatma, Jivatma (being enclosed within Jivas). As the Jivas are conceived\nmany by Maya, not in reality; so \xc3\x8es\'varas also are conceived many by Maya; not\nin essence. O Mountain! This Avidya and nothing else, is the cause of the\ndifference in Jivas, by creating differences in their bodies, indriyas\n(organs) and minds. Again, due to the varieties in the three Gu _n_ as and\ntheir wants (due to the differences between Sattvik, Rajasik and Tamasik\ndesires), Maya also appears various. And their differences are the causes of\ndifferent \xc3\x8es\'varas, Brahma, Vi _sn_ u and others. O Mountain! This whole world\nis interwoven in Me; It is I that am the \xc3\x8es\'vara that resides in causal\nbodies; I am the "Sutratman, Hira _n_ yagarbha that resides in subtle bodies\nand it is I that am the Vira _t_ , residing in the gross bodies. I am Brahma,\nVi _sn_ u, and Mahes\'vara; I am the Brahma, Vai _sn_ avi and Raudri S\'aktis. I\nam the Sun, I am the Moon, I am the Stars; I am beast, birds, Cha _nd_ alas\nand I am the Thief, I am the cruel hunter; I am the virtuous high-souled\npersons and I am the female, male, and hermaphrodite. There is no doubt in\nthis. O Mountain! Wherever there is anything, seen or heard, I alway exist\nthere, within and without, There is nothing moving or unmoving, that can exist\nwithout Me. If there be such, that is like the son of a barren woman. Just as\none rope is mistaken for a snake or a garland, so I am the One Brahma and\nappears as \xc3\x8es\'vara, etc. There is no doubt in this. This world cannot appear\nwithout a substratum.\n\np. 712\n\nAnd That Substratum is My Existence. There can be nothing else.\n\n20\\. The Himalayas said :-- "O Devi! If Thou art merciful on me, I desire,\nthen, to see Thy Vira _t_ form in the Fourth Dimensional Space.\n\nThis sight is developed when the mind resides in the heart centre or in the\ncentre of the eye-brows. A proper teacher is necessary.\n\n21-41. Vyasa said :-- "O King! Hearing the words of Giriraja, Vi _sn_ u and\nall the other Devas gladly seconded him. Then the Devi, the Goddess of the\nUniverse, knowing the desires of the Devas, showed Her Own Form that fulfils\nthe desires of the Bhaktas, that is auspicious and that is like the Kalpa Vrik\n_s_ a towards the Bhaktas. They saw Her Highest Vira _t_ Form. The Satyaloka\nis situated on the topmost part and is Her head; the Sun and Moon are Her\neyes; the quarters, Her ears; the Vedas are Her words; the Universe is Her\nheart; the earth is Her loins; the Bhuvarloka is Her navel; the asterisms are\nHer Thighs; the Maharloka is Her neck; the Janarloka is Her Face; the\nTaparloka is Her head, situated below the S\'atyaloka; Indra and the Devas and\nthe Svarloka is Her arms; the sound is the organ of Her ears; the As\'vin\ntwins, Her nose; the smell is the organ of smell; the fire is within Her face;\nday and night are like Her two wings. The four-faced Brahma is Her eyebrows;\nwater is Her palate; the juice thereof is Her organ of taste; Yama, the God of\nDeath, is Her large teeth; the affection is Her small teeth; Maya is Her\nsmile; the creation of Universe is Her sidelooks; modesty is Her upper lip;\ncovetousness is Her lower lip; unrighteousness is Her back. The Prajapati is\nHer organ of generation; the oceans are Her bowels; the mountains are Her\nbones; the rivers are Her veins; and the trees are the hairs of Her body. O\nKing! Youth, virginity, and old age are Her best gaits, positions or ways\n(courses) paths, the clouds are Her handsome hairs; the two twilights are Her\nclothings; the Moon is the mind of the Mother of the Universe; Hari is Her\nVijnana S\'akti (the knowledge power); and Rudra is Her all-destroying power.\nThe horses and other animals are Her loins; the lower regions Atala, etc., are\nHer lower regions from Her hip to Her feet. The Devas began to behold Her this\nCosmic (Vira _t_ a) appearance with eyes, wide awake, with wonder. Thousands\nof fiery rays emitted from Her form; She began to lick the whole universe with\nHer lips; the two rows of teeth began to make horrible sounds; fires came out\nfrom Her eyes; various weapons were seen in Her hands; and the Brahma _n_ as\nand K _s_ attriyas are become the food of that Awful Deity. Thousands of\nheads, eyes and feet were seen in that form. Crores of Suns, crores of\nlightnings flashes, mingled there. Horrible, Awful, That appearance looked\nterrific to the eyes, heart and mind. The Devas thus beheld and began to utter\ncries of horror and consternation; their hearts trembled and they were\n\np. 713\n\ncaught with immoveable senselessness. "Here is the Devi, our Mother and\nPreserver." This idea vanished away at once from their minds.\n\nAt this moment the Vedas that were on the four sides of the Devi, removed the\nswoon of the Devas and made them conscious. The Immortals got, then, the\nexcellent Vedas; and, having patience, began to praise and chant hymns in\nwords choked with feelings and with tears flowing flowing from their eyes.\n\n42-53. The Devas said :-- "O Mother! Forgive our faults. Protect us, the\nmiserable, that are born of Thee. O Protectress of the Devas! Withhold Thy\nanger; we are very much terrified at the sight of Thy this form. "O Devi! We\nare inferior immortals; what prayers can we offer to Thee! Thou Thyself canst\nnot measure Thy powers; how then can we, who are born later, know of Thy\ngreatness! Obeisance to Thee, the Lady of the Universe! Obeisance to Thee of\nthe nature of the Pra _n_ ava Om; Thou art the One that is proved in all the\nVedantas. Obeisance to Thee, of the form of Hrim! Obeisance to Thee, the Self\nof all, whence has originated the Fire, the Sun, and the Moon and whence have\nsprung all the medicinal plants. Obeisance to the Devi, the Cosmic Deity, the\nSelf in all whence have sprung all the Devas, Sadhyas, the beasts, birds, and\nmen! We bow down again and again to the Great Form, Maha Maya, the Self of\nall, whence have sprung the vital breath Pra _n_ a, Apana, grains and wheats,\nand Who is the source of asceticism, faith, truth, continence and the rules\nwhat to do and what not to do under the present circumstances. The seven Pra\n_n_ as, the seven Lokas, the seven Flames, the seven Samidhs, the seven\nOblations to Fire, have sprung from Thee! Obeisance to Thee, the Great Self in\nall! Obeisance to the Universal form of the Deity of the Universe whence have\nsprung all the oceans, all the mountains, all the rivers, all the medicinal\nplants and all the Rasas (the tastes of all things). We bow down to that Vira\n_t_ Form, the Great Self, the Maha Maya, whence have originated the\nsacrifices, the sacrifical post (to which the victim about to be immolated is\nbound) and Dak _s_ i _n_ as (the sacrificial fees) and the Rik, the Yajus, and\nthe Sama Vedas. O Mother! O Maha Maya! We bow down to Thy front, to Thy back,\nto Thy both the sides, to Thy top, to Thy bottom and on all sides of Thee. O\nDevi! Be kind enough to withhold this Extraordinary Terrific Form of Thine,\nand shew us Thy Beautiful Lovely Form.\n\n54-56. Vyasa said :-- "O King! The World Mother, the Ocean of mercy, seeing\nthe Devas terrified, withheld Her Fearful Cosmic Form and showed Her very\nbeautiful appearance, pleasing to the whole world. Her body became soft and\ngentle. In one hand She held the noose, and in another She held the goad. The\ntwo other hands made signs to dispel all their fears\n\np. 714\n\nand ready to grant the boons. Her eyes emitted rays of kindness; Her face was\nadorned with beautiful smiles. The Devas became glad at this and bowed down to\nHer in a peaceful mind and then spoke with great joy.\n\nHere ends the Thirty-third Chapter of the Seventh Book on the Devi\'s Vira _t_\nRupa in the Maha Para _n_ am, Sri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 34](bk07ch34.htm)\n\n'
