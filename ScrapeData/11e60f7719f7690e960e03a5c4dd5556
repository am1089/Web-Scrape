The preparation of the brahmaudana, the porridge given as a fee to\nthe Brahmans.\n\n1\\. O Agni, come into being! Aditi here in her throes, longing for sons, is\ncooking the porridge for the Brahmans, The seven Rishis, that did create the\nbeings, shall here churn thee, along with progeny!  \n2\\. Produce the smoke, ye lusty friends; unharmed by wiles go ye into the\ncontest! Here is the Agni (fire) who gains battles, and commands powerful\nwarriors, with whom the gods did conquer the demons.  \n3\\. O Agni, to a great heroic deed thou wast aroused, to cook the Brahman's\nporridge, O Gatavedas! The seven Rishis, that did create the beings, have\nproduced thee. Grant her (the wife) wealth together with undiminished heroes!  \n4\\. Burn, O Agni, after having been kindled by the firewood, bring skilfully\nhither the gods that are to be revered! Causing the oblation to cook for these\n(Brahmans), do thou raise this (sacrificer) to the highest firmament!  \n5\\. The, threefold share which was of yore assigned to you (belongs) to the\ngods, the (departed) Fathers, and to the mortals (the priests). Know your\nshares! I divide them for you: the (share) of the gods shall protect this\n(woman)!  \n6\\. O Agni, possessed of might, superior, thou dost without fail prevail! Bend\ndown to the ground our hateful rivals!--This measure, that is being measured,\nand has been measured, may constitute thy kin into (people) that render thee\ntribute!  \n7\\. Mayest thou together with thy kin be endowed with sap! Elevate her (the\nwife) to great heroism! Ascend on high to the base of the firmament, which\nthey call 'the world of brightness'!  \n8\\. This great goddess earth, kindly disposed, shall receive the (sacrificial)\nskin! Then may we go to the world of well-doing (heaven)!  \n9\\. Lay these two press-stones, well coupled, upon the skin; crush skilfully\nthe (soma-) shoots for the sacrificer! Crush down, (O earth), and beat down,\nthose who are hostile to her (the wife); lift up high, and elevate her\noffspring!  \n10\\. Take into thy hands, O man, the press-stones that work together: the gods\nthat are to be revered have come to thy sacrifice! Whatever three wishes thou\ndost choose, I shall here procure for thee unto fulfilment.  \n11\\. This, (O winnowing-basket), is thy purpose, and this thy nature: may\nAditi, mother of heroes, take hold of thee! Winnow out those who are hostile\nto this (woman); afford her wealth and undiminished heroes!  \n12\\. Do ye, (O grains), remain in the (winnowing-) basket, while (the wind)\nblows over you; be separated, ye who are fit for the sacrifice, from the\nchaff! May we in happiness be superior to all our equals! I bend down under\nour feet those that hate us.  \n13\\. Retire, O woman, and return promptly! The stable of the waters (water-\nvessel) has settled upon thee, that thou mayest carry it: of these (the\nwaters) thou shalt take such as are fit for sacrifice; having intelligently\ndivided them off, thou shalt leave the rest behind!  \n14\\. These bright women, (the waters), have come hither. Arise, thou woman,\nand gather strength! To thee, that art rendered by thy husband a true wife,\n(and) by thy children rich in offspring, the sacrifice has come: receive the\n(water-) vessel!  \n15\\. The share of food that belongs to you of yore has been set aside for you.\nInstructed by the Rishis bring thou (woman) hither this water! May this\nsacrifice win advancement for you, win prAection, win offspring for you; may\nit be mighty, win cattle, and heroes for you!  \n16\\. O Agni, the sacrificial pot has settled upon thee: do thou shining,\nbrightly glowing, heat it with thy glow! May the divine descendants of the\nRishis, assembled about their share (of the porridge), full of fervour, heat\nthis (pot) at the proper time!  \n17\\. Pure and clear may these sacrificial women, the waters bright, flow into\nthe pot! The), have given us abundant offspring and cattle. May he that cooks\nthe porridge go to the world of the pious (heaven)!  \n18\\. Purified by (our) prayer, and clarified by the ghee are the soma-shoots,\n(and) these sacrificial grains. Enter the water; may the pot receive you! When\nye have cookect this (porridge) go ye to the world of the pious (heaven)!  \n19\\. Spread out far unto great extent, with a thousand surfaces, in the world\nof the pious! Grandfathers, fathers, children, grandchildren--I am the\nfifteenth one that did cook thee.  \n20\\. The porridge has a thousand surfaces, a hundred streams, and is\nindestructible; it is the road of the gods, leads to heaven. Yonder (enemies)\ndo I place upon thee: injure them and their offspring; (but) to me that brings\ngifts thou shalt be merciful!  \n21\\. Step upon the altar (vedi); make this woman thrive in her progeny; repel\nthe demons.; advance her! May we in happiness be superior to all our equals! I\nbend down under our feet all those that hate us.  \n22\\. Turn towards her with cattle, (thou pot), face towards her, together with\nthe divine powers! Neither curses nor hostile magic shall reach thee; rule in\nthy dwelling free from disease!  \n23\\. Properly built, placed with care, this altar (vedi) has been arranged of\nyore for the Brahmans porridge. Put it, O woman, upon the purified amsadhrl;\nplace there the porridge for the divine (Brahmanas)!  \n24\\. May this sacrificial ladle (sruk), the second hand of Aditi, which the\nseven Rishis, the creators of the beings, did fashion, may this spoon, knowing\nthe limbs of the porridge, heap it upon the altar!  \n25\\. The divine (Brahmanas) shall sit down to thee, the cooked saerfice: do\nthou again descending from the fire, approach them! Clarified by soma settle\nin the belly of the Brahmanas; the descendants of the Rishis who eat thee\nshall not take harm!  \n26\\. O king Soma, infuse harmony into the good Brahmanas who shall sit about\nthee! Eagerly do I invite to the porridge the Rishis, descended from Rishis,\nthat are born of religious fervour, and gladly obey the call.  \n27\\. These pure and clear sacrificial women (the waters) I put into the hands\nof the Brahmanas severally. With whatever wish I pour this upon you, may\nIndra. accompanied by the Maruts grant this to me!  \n28\\. This gold is my immortal light, this ripe fruit of the field is my wish-\ngranting cow. This treasure I present to the Brahmanas: I prepare for myself a\nroad that leads. to the Fathers in the heavens.  \n29\\. Scatter the spelt into Agni Gatavedas (the fire), sweep away to a far\ndistance the chaff! This (chaff) we have heard, is the share of the ruler of\nthe house (Agni), and we know, too, what belonos to Nirriti (destruction) as\nher share.  \n30\\. Note, (O porridge), him that takes pains, and cooks and presses the soma;\nlift him up to the heavenly road, upon which, after he has reached the fullest\nage, he shall ascend to the highest firmament, the supreme heavens!  \n31\\. Anoint (with ghee), O adhvaryu (priest), the surface of this sustaining\n(porridge), make skilfully a place for the melted butter; with ghee do thou\nanoint all its limbs! I prepare for myself a road that leads to the Fathers in\nthe heavens.  \n32\\. O sustaining (porridge), cast destruction and strife among such as are\nsitting about thee, and are not Brahmanas! (But) the descendants of the\n-Rishis, that eat thee, being full of substance, spreading forth, shall not\ntake harm!  \n33\\. To the descendants of the Rishis I make thee over, O porridge; those who\nare not descended from Rishis have no share in it! May Agni as my guardian,\nmay all the Maruts, and all the gods watch over the cooked food!  \n34\\. Thee (the porridge) that milkest the sacrifice, art evermore abundant,\nthe male milch-cow, the seat of wealth, we beseech for immortality of off-\nspring and long life with abundance of wealth.  \n35\\. Thou art a lusty male, penetratest heaven: go thou to the Rishis,\ndescended from Rishis! Dwell in the world of the pious: there is a well-\nprepared (place) for us two!  \n36\\. Pack thyself up, go forth! O Agni, prepare the roads, that lead to the\ngods! By these: well-prepared (roads) may we reach the sacrifice, standing\nupon the firmament (that shines) with seven rays!  \n37\\. With the light with which the gods, having cooked the porridge for the\nBramanas, ascended to heaven, to the world of the pious, with that would we go\nto the world of the pious, ascending to the light, to the highest firmament!\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XII, 3.
