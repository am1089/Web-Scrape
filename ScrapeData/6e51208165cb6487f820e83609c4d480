And the reference (to the individual soul) has a different meaning.\n\nThe alleged reference to the individual soul which has been pointed out (by\nthe purvapakshin) in the passage complementary to the passage about the small\nether ('Now that serene being,' &c., VIII, 3, 4) teaches, if the small ether\nis interpreted to mean the highest Lord, neither the worship of the individual\nsoul nor any qualification of the subject under discussion (viz. the small\nether), and is therefore devoid of meaning.--On that account the Sutra\ndeclares that the reference has another meaning, i.e. that the reference to\nthe individual soul is not meant to determine the nature of the individual\nsoul, but rather the nature of the highest Lord. In the following manner. The\nindividual soul which, in the passage referred to, is called the serene being,\nacts in the waking state as the ruler of the aggregate comprising the body and\nthe sense-organs; permeates in sleep the na _d_ is of the body, and enjoys the\ndream visions resulting from the impressions of the waking state; and,\nfinally, desirous of reaching an inner refuge, rises in the state of deep\nsleep beyond its imagined connexion with the gross and the subtle body,\nreaches the highest light, i.e. the highest Brahman previously called ether,\nand thus divesting itself of the state of specific cognition appears in its\nown (true) nature. The highest light which the soul is to reach and through\nwhich it is manifested in its true nature is the Self, free from sin and so\non, which is there represented as the object of worship.--In this sense the\nreference to the individual soul can be admitted by those also who maintain\nthat in reality the highest Lord is meant.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 21](sbe34090.htm)\n\n"
