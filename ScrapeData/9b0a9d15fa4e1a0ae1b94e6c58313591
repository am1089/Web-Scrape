The Ri _s_ is said :-- \xc2\x93O Suta! What did Veda Vyasa do, when the highest\nYogi S\xc2\x92uka, Deva-like, acquired all the excellent supernatural powers? Kindly\ndescribe all these in detail.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHearing this question, Suta spoke :-- O Rishis! Vyasa already had with him\nmany disciples Asita, Devala, Vais\'ampayana, Jaimini, Sumantu and others, all\nengaged in the study of the Vedas. After their studies were over, they all\nwent out to propagate Dharma on the earth. Then Vyasa , seeing that the\ndisciples went to the earth and his son S\xc2\x92uka Deva had got to the next world,\nbecame very much distressed with sorrow and wanted to go to some other place.\nHe then decided to go to his birth place and went to the banks of the Ganges\nand there remembered his auspicious mother Satyavati, forsaken by him before,\nvery sorrowful, and the daughter of a fisherman. He then quitted that heaven-\nlike mountain, the source of all happiness and came to his own birth place.\nReaching the island where he was born, he enquired the whereabouts of the\nbeautiful faced, the fisherman\'s daughter as well the wife of a king. The\nfishermen replied that their king had given her in marriage to the king\nS\'antanu. Then the king of fishermen, seeing Vyasa there, gladly worshipped\nhim and gave him a cordial welcome and spoke with folded palms, thus :--\n\n\n\n9-16. O Muni! When I have become so fortunate as to see you, rare even to the\nDevas, then my birth has been sanctified today and you have purified my\nfamily. O Brahmin! Kindly say what for have you come?\n\n\n\np. 74\n\n\n\nMy wife, son and all my riches and every other thing that I have are at your\ndisposal. Thus hearing the history of his mother Satyavati, Vyasa erected an\n\xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama on the beautiful banks of the river Sarasvati and remained there in\ntapasya with an enlightened mind.\n\n\n\nSome time elapsed when the highly energetic S\xc2\x92antanu got through his wife\nSatyavati two sons. Vyasa Deva considered them as his two brothers and became\nvery glad, though he himself used to live in the forest. The first son of the\nking S\xc2\x92antanu was Chitrangada, endowed with all auspicious qualities,\nexceedingly beautiful, and tormenting his foes; the second son was Vichitra-\nvirya; he was endowed with all qualities. The king S\xc2\x92antanu became very happy\nto get these children. S\xc2\x92antanu had one son before through his wife Ganga; he\nwas a great hero and very powerful; and the two sons of Satyavati were equally\npowerful. The high souled S\xc2\x92antanu now seeing the three sons, all endowed with\nall auspicious qualities, began to think that the Devas were incapable to\ndefeat him.\n\n\n\n17-34. After some time, the religious S\xc2\x92antanu quitted his worn-out body as a\nman quits his clothes worn out in due time. After the king S\xc2\x92antanu had\nascended the Heavens, the energetic Bhis\'ma performed duly his funeral\nobsequies and gave various things in charity to the Brahma _n_ as. He did not\naccept the kingdom himself; but placed Chitrangada on the throne and became\nknown by the name of Devavrata (truthful in vow like the Devas). The pure\nsouled Chitrangada, born of Satyavati became so much powerful by sheer force\nof his arms, and became so great a hero that the enemies felt endless\ntroubles. Now once on an occasion, the greatly powerful Chitrangada,\nsurrounded by a great army, went on an hunting excursion to the forest in\nquest of ruru deer, etc., when the Gandarbha Chitrangada, seeing the king on\nthe way, alighted from his chariot.\n\n\n\nO ascetics! A fierce battle then ensued for three years on that sacred and\nwide expanse Kuruk _s_ ettra between the two heroes, both equally powerful. In\nthe battle, the king Chitrangada, the son of S\xc2\x92antanu was slain by the\nGandarbha Chitrangada and went up to Heavens. Bhis\xc2\x92ma, born of the womb of\nGanga, hearing the above news, expressed his sorrows and, being surrounded by\nthe ministers completed all the funeral obsequies and installed Vichitravirya\non the throne. The beautiful Satyavati became very much agitated by the death\nof her son; but when the ministers and the highsouled spiritual teachers\nconsoled her, she became glad when she saw that her youngest son became king.\nVyasa Deva, too, felt himself glad to hear that his youngest brother had been\nmade king. After some time when the all auspicious, Satyavati\'s son\nVichitravirya attained his youth,\n\n\n\np. 75\n\n\n\nBhis\xc2\x92ma began to think of his marriage. At this time the king of Kasi\n(Kas\'iraj) called an assembly Svayamvara (where the kings are invited and the\nbride selects the bridegroom) for the marriage of her three daughters, endowed\nwith all auspicious qualities, at one and the same time. Thousands and\nthousands of kings and princes from various countries were invited there in\nthe assembly; and, worshipped duly, they went and decorated the hall. At that\ntime the highly energetic fiery Bhis\xc2\x92ma alone, mounting on his chariot,\nattacked the infantry and cavalry, and defeated all the kings assembled there,\nand perforce carried away the three daughters of Kas\'iraj and took them to\nHastinapur. Bhis\xc2\x92ma behaved towards those three daughters as if they were\nmothers, sisters or daughters and informed Satyavati without any delay of\neverything that had happened.\n\n\n\n35-39. Then he called for the astrologers and Brahmi _n_ s, versed in the\nVedas and enquired about the auspicious day for their marriage. When the day\nwas fixed and when every preparation was made, the religious Bhis\xc2\x92ma wanted\nVichitravirya to marry them. At this time, the eldest daughter, beautiful-eyed\nspoke out modestly to the Ganga\'s son Bhis\xc2\x92ma :-- \xc2\x93O Ganga\'s son, the\nillustrious son of your family and the best of the Kurus! You are the best\nknower of Dharma; therefore what more shall I say to you. In the Svayamvara\nassembly I mentally selected S\'alva and it struck me that he, too, looked on\nme with a very loving heart towards me. So, O tormentor of foes! Now do what\nis fit for that sacred family; O Ganga\'s son! Not only you are extraordinarily\npowerful but you are also the foremost of the religious. Salva mentally wanted\nto marry me; now do as you like.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n40-44. When the eldest daughter spoke thus, Bhis\xc2\x92ma asked the aged Brahma _n_\nas, ministers and his mother \xc2\x93What ought to be done now\xc2\x94 and, taking the\nopinions of all, spoke to that daughter :-- \xc2\x93O beautiful one! You can go\nwherever you like.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, Bhis\xc2\x92ma released her. Then the beautiful\ndaughter of Kasiraj went to the house of Salvaraj and expressed to him her\nheart\'s desire :-- \xc2\x93O great king! Knowing me attached to yourself, Bhis\xc2\x92ma has\nquitted me according to the laws of Dharma; I have therefore come to you now;\nmarry me. O best of the kings! I will be your legal wife, for already I used\nto think you as my husband and you, too, must have thought me your wife.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n45-47. S\'alva replied as follows :-- \xc2\x93O beautiful one! When Bhis\xc2\x92ma caught\nhold of your arm before me and took you to his chariot, then I won\'t marry\nyou. You can say yourself what intelligent man can marry a woman touched by\nanother? Therefore I won\'t marry you, though\n\n\n\np. 76\n\n\n\nBhis\xc2\x92ma has quitted you, in the light of another.\xc2\x94 Hearing these words of\nS\xc2\x92alva, the daughter of Kasiraj wept bitterly; yet S\xc2\x92alva quitted her.\nTherefore, finding no other way, she went back to Bhis\xc2\x92ma weeping, and said as\nfollows :--\n\n\n\n48-50. O great warrior! S\xc2\x92alva did not consent to marry me, as you first took\nme to the chariot and afterwards left me. So, O Mahabhaga! You better look to\nDharma and marry me, as you know best what is Dharma. If you do not marry me,\nI will certainly quit my life. Hearing her words Bhis\xc2\x92ma said :-- O beautiful\none! How can I accept you, when your mind has become attached towards another.\nSo, O fair one! You better go back soon to your own father with a calm, clear\nmind. When Bhis\xc2\x92ma said thus, that daughter of Kasiraj did not go back, out of\nsheer shame, to her father\'s house, but went to a forest and in a greatly\nsolitary place of pilgrimage began to practise asceticism.\n\n\n\n51-56. Now the other two daughters of Kasiraj, beautiful and all auspicious\nAmbalika and Ambika became the wives of the king Vichitravirya. Thus the\npowerful king Vichitravirya began to enjoy various pleasures in the palace and\nin the gardens and thus passed his time. For full nine years the king\nVichitravirya enjoyed the sexual pleasures and became attacked with\nconsumption and fell into the jaws of death. Hearing the death news of her son\nVichitravirya, Satyavati became very sorry and surrounded by her ministers,\nperformed his funeral obsequies. Then she spoke privately to Bhis\xc2\x92ma with a\ngrievous heart :-- \xc2\x93O highly fortunately son! now you better govern your\nfather\'s kingdom and see that the family of Yayati does not become extinct. So\nbetter take your brother\'s wife and try your best to continue your family\nline.\n\n\n\n57-74. Bhis\xc2\x92ma then said :-- "O Mother! Did you not hear of the promise that I\nalready made before my father? So I cannot ever marry and govern the kingdom.\xc2\x94\nHearing these words of Bhis\xc2\x92ma, Satyavati became anxious. She began to think\nas follows :-- \xc2\x93How now the continuity of the family be kept! And it is not\nadvisable to remain idle when the kingdom has become kingless; no happiness\ncan be derived in this state.\xc2\x94 Thus thinking, she became exceedingly\ndistressed; then the Ganga\'s son, Bhis\xc2\x92ma spoke to her :-- \xc2\x93O respected one!\nDo not worry your mind with cares; now take steps so as to secure a son from\nVichitravirya\'s wife. Call some best Brahmin, born of a good family and unite\nhim with Vichitravirya\'s wife. There is no fault, as far as I know, in doing\nthus to keep up the family line. O sweet smiling one! Thus having begotten the\ngrandson, give him this kingdom; I will also obey his commands.\xc2\x94 Hearing these\nreasonable words of Bhis\xc2\x92ma, Satyavati remem\n\n\n\np. 77\n\n\n\nbered her own son, the sinless Vyasa Deva, who was born to her during her\nvirginity. As soon as Vyasa was remembered, he, the great ascetic and\neffulgent like the sun, came there and bowed down to his mother. The highly\nenergetic Vyasa was then worshipped duly by Bhis\xc2\x92ma and welcome by Satyavati\nand began to rest there like a smokeless fire. The mother Satyavati then spoke\nto the chief Muni :-- \xc2\x93O son! Now procreate a beautiful son from your sperm\nand the ovum of Vichitravirya\'s wife.\xc2\x94 Hearing the mother\'s words, Vyasa\nconsidered them as Veda\'s injunction and thought they must be obeyed and\npromised before her that he must obey and and fulfil her orders. He remained\nthere, waiting for the menstruation period. When the due period of\nmenstruation arrived, Ambika bathed and had a sexual intercourse with Vyasa\nand begot a very powerful son, but a blind one (since she closed her eyes at\nthe sight of Vyasa during her intercourse). Seeing the son born blind\nSatyavati became exceedingly sorry; she, then, asked her other son\'s wife :--\n\xc2\x93Go soon and get a son born of you in the aforesaid manner.\xc2\x94 When the\nmenstruation period arrived, Ambalika during the night time went to Vyasa and\nmixed and became pregnant. In due time a son was born; that child became of a\nvery pale colour; so Satyavati thought the new child, too, unfit for the\nkingdom; therefore at the end of the year again asked her son\'s wife Ambalika\nto go to Vyasa . She asked Vyasa also for the same purpose and sent Ambalika\nto his bed room. But Ambalika became afraid, and could not go herself but sent\nher maid servant for the purpose. Thus from the womb of the maid servant the\nhigh souled Vidura was born, having Dharma\'s parts and the most auspicious\ntowards all. Thus Vyasa begot three very powerful sons Dhritara _st_ ra, Pan\n_d_ u and Vidura for the continuity of the family line. O sinless Mahar _s_\nis! Thus I have described to you how my Guru Vyasa Deva, who knows well all\nthe Dharmas, kept up the continuity of his family and how he begot sons in the\nwomb of his brother Vichitravirya\'s wives, according to the laws of Dharma, to\nkeep up a family.\n\n\n\nThus ends the twentieth chapter of the 1st Skandha as well as the first\nSkandha on Vyasa doing his duties in the Mahapura _n_ am S\'ri Devi Bhagavatam\nof 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa .\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 1](bk02ch01.htm)\n\n'
