With worldly words the 'bountiful goddess' to the northern (hut),\n\n3\\. To the middle (between the two huts) the 'conqueror.'\n\n4\\. He gives them water to drink in the same order in which they have been led\n(to their places), takes three portions of boiled rice (from the Sthalipaka\nprepared for \xc3\x8e _s_ ana), takes (these portions of rice) to the fire, makes\n(the three gods) touch them with the next (formulas, II, 18, II-13),\nsacrifices of these portions, to each god of the portion which belongs to him,\nwith the next (formulas, II, 18, 14-30), cuts off (Avadanas) from all\n(portions), and sacrifices with the next Ya _g_ us (II, 18, 31) to Agni Svish\n_t_ ak _ri_ t.\n\n5\\. Having worshipped (the god \xc3\x8e _s_ ana) with the next Ya _g_ us (II, 18,\n32), he distributes with the next (formulas, II, 18, 33-39) leaves together\nwith portions of boiled rice, two (leaves) with each (Ya _g_ us), then ten to\nthe divine hosts (II, 18, 40), and ten to the (divine hosts) that follow (and\nare referred to in the next Ya _g_ us, II, 18, 41).\n\np. 291\n\n6\\. With the next (formulas, II, 18, 42-45) he does the same as before (i.e.\nhe distributes two leaves with each Mantra).\n\n7\\. Having formed a lump of boiled rice, he puts it into a basket of leaves,\nand with the next Ya _g_ us (II, 18, 46) hangs it up on a tree.\n\n8\\. Here he should murmur the Rudra texts (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. IV, 5),\n\n9\\. Or the first and last (Anuvaka).\n\n10\\. He places his cows around the fire so that the smoke (of the sacrifice)\nmay reach them.\n\n11. 11 With his firmly shut fist full of Darbha grass he besprinkles (them) with scents; the bull first.\n\n12\\. He should perform a sacrifice to Kshetrapati, without a fire, in the path\nused by his cows.\n\n13\\. He has (the Kshetrapati) led to his place in the same way as the \xc3\x8e _s_\nana (see above, Sutra 1).\n\n14\\. He puts (portions of boiled rice) into four or seven leaves, naming (the\ngod).\n\n15. 15 Let him sacrifice quickly; the god has a strong digestion (?).\n\n16\\. With the next two (verses, II, 18, 47. 48) he does worship (to\nKshetrapati).\n\n17\\. The Sthalipaka (belonging to \xc3\x8e _s_ ana) he gives to the Brahma _n_ as to\neat;\n\n18\\. That belonging to Kshetrapati his uterine relations eat,\n\n19\\. Or as is the custom in their family.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[290:1](sbe30113.htm#fr_785) 20, 1-3. Comp. Hira _n_ yak.
