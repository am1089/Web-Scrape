Garu\xe1\xb8\x8da said: What is the path of misery in the world of Yama like? Tell\nme, O Ke\xc5\x9bava, in what, way the sinful go there.\n\n2\\. The Blessed Lord said: I will tell you about the Way of Yama, bestowing\ngreat misery. Although you are my devotee, when you have heard it you will\nbecome agitated.\n\n3\\. There is no shade of trees there, in which a man may take rest, and on\nthis road there is none of the foods by which he may support life.\n\n4\\. No water is to be seen anywhere that he, extremely thirsty, may drink.\nTwelve suns blaze, O Bird, as though at the end of a pralaya.\n\n5\\. There the sinful soul goes along pierced by cold winds, in one place torn\nby thorns, in another stung by very venomous serpents.\n\n6\\. The sinful in one place is bitten by ferocious lions, tigers, and dogs; in\nanother stung by scorpions; in another burnt by fire.\n\n7-8. In one place there is a very terrible forest of sword-like leaves, which\nis recorded as two thousand yojanas in length and breadth,\n\np. 11\n\nInfested with crows, owls, hawks, vultures, bees, mosquitoes, and having\nforest-fires,--by whose leaves he is pierced and torn.\n\n9\\. In one place he falls into a hidden well; in another from a lofty\nmountain; in another he treads on razor-edges and on spear-points.\n\n10\\. In one place he stumbles in the awful black darkness and falls into\nwater; in another in mud abounding in leeches; in another in hot slime.\n\n11\\. In one place is a plain of hot sand, made of smelted. copper; in another\na mound of embers; in another a great cloud of smoke.\n\n12-13. In some places are showers of charcoal, showers of stones and\nthunderbolts, showers of blood, showers of weapons, showers of boiling water,\n\nAnd showers of caustic mud. In one place are deep chasms; in others bills to\nclimb and valleys to descend.\n\n14\\. In one place there is pitch darkness; in another rocks difficult to climb\nover; in others lakes filled with pus and blood, and with excrement.\n\n15-17. In the midst of the way flows the terribly horrible Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab River,\nwhich when seen inspires misery, of which even an account arouses fear.\n\np. 12\n\nExtending a hundred yojanas, a flow of pus and blood, impassible, with heaps\nof bones on the banks, with mud of flesh and blood,\n\nUnfordable, impassible for the sinful, obstructed with hairy moss, filled with\nhuge crocodiles. and crowded with hundreds of dreadful birds.\n\n18-20. When it sees the sinful approaching, this river, overspread with flames\nand smoke, seethes, O T\xc4\x81rkshya, like butter in the frying-pan:\n\nCovered all over with dreadful throngs of insects with piercing stings,\ninfested with huge vultures and crows with adamantine beaks,\n\nFilled with porpoises, with crocodiles, with leeches, fishes and turtles, and\nwith other flesh-eating water-animals.\n\n21\\. Very sinful people, fallen into the flood, cry, O Brother, O Son, O\nFather!'--again and again wailing.\n\n22-23. Hungry and thirsty the sinful drink the blood, it is said. That river,\nflowing with blood, carrying much foam,\n\nVery dreadful, with powerful roaring, difficult to see into, fear-inspiring,--\nat the very sight of it the sinful swoon away.\n\n24\\. Covered with many scorpions, and with black snakes,--of those who have\nfallen into the midst of this, there is no rescuer whatever.\n\n25\\. By hundreds of thousands of whirlpools the sinful descend to the lower\nregion. They stay for a moment in the lower region, after the moment rising\nagain.\n\np. 13\n\n26\\. O Bird, this river was created only that the sinful should fall into it.\nIt is difficult to cross and gives great misery, and its opposite cannot be\nseen.\n\n27\\. Thus along the Way of Yama, of many kinds of pain, giving extreme misery,\ngo the sinful, crying and weeping and laden with misery.\n\n28\\. Bound by the noose, some of them being dragged by hooks, and pierced from\nbehind with points of weapons, the sinful are led on.\n\n29\\. Others are drawn along by a noose through the end of the nose, and also\nby nooses through the ears; others, by the nooses of death being dragged\nalong, are pecked by crows.\n\n30-32. Some go on the way neck, arms, feet and back bound with chains, bearing\nmany loads of iron,\n\nAnd being beaten with hammers by the awful messengers of Yama; vomiting blood\nfrom the mouth, which then they eat again,\n\nBewailing their own karmas these beings, becoming exhausted, full of very\ngreat misery, go on towards the mansion of Yama.\n\n33-34. And the stupid, thus going on the way, calling on son and grandson,\nincessantly crying out, 'Oh, oh,' repents:--\n\n'By great meritorious effort birth as a human being is gained. Haying obtained\nthat, I did not do my duty,--also, whatever have I done!\n\np. 14\n\n35\\. 'I made no gifts; no offerings to the fire; performed no penances; did\nnot worship the deities; did not perform service at a place of pilgrimage as\nprescribed;--O Dweller in the Body, make reparation for whatever you have\ndone!\n\n36\\. 'I did not duly honour the assemblies of Br\xc4\x81hmi\xe1\xb9\x87s; did not visit the holy\nriver 1; did not wait upon good men; never performed any benevolent acts;--O\nDweller in the Body, make reparation for whatever you have done!\n\n37\\. ' Alas, I did not excavate tanks in waterless places, either for the\nbenefit of men or for the sake of animals and binds; did not even a little for\nthe support of cows and brahmins;--O Dweller in the Body, make reparation for\nwhatever you leave done!\n\n38\\. 'I made no daily gifts and did not give food daily to the cow; did not\nvalue the precepts of the Vedas and the \xc5\x9a\xc4\x81stras; did not listen to the\nPur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as, nor worship the wise;--O Dweller in the Body, make reparation for\nwhatever you have done!'\n\n39\\. 'I did not follow the good advice of my husband; never preserved fidelity\nto my husband; did not pay due respect to my worthy elders;--O Dweller in the\nBody, make reparation for whatever you have done!\n\n40\\. 'Not knowing my duty I did not serve my husband, nor after his death\nenter the fire. Having become widowed I performed no austerities;--O Dweller\nin the Body, make reparation for whatever you have done!\n\np. 15\n\n41\\. 'I did not emaciate myself by monthly fasts by the course of the moon,\nnor by detailed observances. Owing to my bad deeds in former lives I got a\nwoman's body, which is a source of great misery.'\n\n42\\. Thus having lamented many times, remembering the past incarnation, crying\n'Whence did I attain this human state?' he goes on.\n\n43\\. For seventeen days he goes on alone with the speed of the wind. On the\neighteenth day, O T\xc4\x81rk\xe1\xb9\xa3ya, the departed reaches the City of Saumya.\n\n44\\. Large numbers of the departed are in that excellent and beautiful city.\nThe River Pu\xe1\xb9\xa3hpabhadr\xc4\x81 is there, and a fig-tree delightful to see.\n\n41\\. In that city he takes rest, along with the servants of Yama. There he\nremembers the enjoyment of wife, son and others, and is miserable.\n\n46-47. When he bewails his wealth, his family and dependents all, then the\ndeparted belonging there and the servants say this:\n\nWhere is your wealth now? Where are your children and wife now? Where are your\nfriends and relatives now? You only suffer the result of your own karma, you\nfool. Go on for a long time!\n\n48\\. 'You know that provisions are the strength of a traveller. You do not\nstrive for provisions, O Traveller in the Higher World! Yet you must\ninevitably go on that way, where there is neither buying nor selling.\n\np. 16\n\n49\\. 'Have you not heard, O Mortal, of this way, which is familiar even to\nchildren? Have you not heard of it from the twice-born, as spoken of in the\nPur\xc4\x81\xe1\xb9\x87as?'\n\n50\\. Thus spoken to by the messengers and being beaten with the hammers, he is\nforcibly dragged by the nooses, falling down and getting up again and running.\n\n51\\. Here he eats the monthly rice-balls given by his sons and grandsons\nthrough either love or compassion, and thence goes on into Sauripura.\n\n52\\. There is there a king named Jangama, who has the appearance of Death.\nHaving seen him he is overcome with fear and decides to give up efforts.\n\n53\\. In that city he eats a mixture of water and food, given at the end of\nthree fortnights, and then passes on from that city.\n\n54\\. Thence the departed speedily goes to Nagendrabhavana; and having seen the\nfearful forests there he cries in misery.\n\n55-56. Being dragged unmercifully he weeps again and again. At the end of two\nmonths the afflicted leaves that city,\n\nHaving enjoyed there the rice-balls, water and cloths given by his relatives;\nbeing again dragged with the nooses he is led onwards by the servants.\n\np. 17\n\n57-58. Upon the coming of the third month, having arrived at the city of the\nGandharvas, and there having eaten the rice-balls offered in the third month\nhe moves on.\n\nAnd in the fourth month reaches \xc5\x9aail\xc4\x81gama city, There stones rain down\ncopiously upon the departed.\n\n59\\. Having eaten the rice-balls of the fourth month he becomes somewhat\nhappy. In the fifth month the departed goes thence to the city of Krauncha.\n\n60\\. Remaining in the city of Krauncha, the departed eats the rice balls given\nby hand in the fifth month, and then, having eaten it, goes to Kr\xc5\xabrapura.\n\n61\\. At the end of five and a half months the ceremony before the six-monthly\nis performed. He remains, satisfied with the rice-balls and jars then given.\n\n62-63. Having stayed, trembling and very miserable, for a time and having left\nthat city, threatened by the servants of Yama,\n\nHe goes to Chitrabhavana, over which kingdom rules a king named Vichitra, who\nis the younger brother of Yama.\n\n64-65. When he sees his huge form he runs away in fear. Then having come\nbefore him some fishermen say:\n\n'We have arrived, bringing a boat for you--who desire to cross the great\nVaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab River--if your merits are sufficient.'\n\np. 18\n\n66-67. 'It is said by the sages, who see the truth, that Vitarana is a gift,\nand this is called Vaitara\xe1\xb9\x87\xc4\xab because it is crossed over by that.\n\n'If you have made the gift of a cow, then the boat will come to you, otherwise\nnot.' Having heard their words, 'Oh heavens,' he exclaims.\n\n68\\. Seeing him it seethes, seeing which he cries loudly. The sinful soul who\nhas made no gifts verily sinks in that.\n\n69\\. Having fixed a skewer through his lips, the messengers, floating in the\nair, carry him across like a fish upon a hook.\n\n70\\. Having then eaten the rice-balls of the sixth month, he passes on. He\ngoes on the way lamenting, very greatly afflicted with the desire to eat.\n\n71\\. At the approach of the seventh month he goes to the city of Bahw\xc4\x81pada.\nThere he enjoys what is given by his sons in the seventh month.\n\n72\\. Having passed beyond that city, he arrives at the city of Duhkhada.\nTravelling in the air he suffers great misery, O Ruler of Birds.\n\n73\\. Having eaten the rice-balls which are given in the eighth month he moves\non. At the end of the ninth month he goes to the city of N\xc4\x81n\xc4\x81kranda.\n\n74\\. Having seen many people crying in agony in various ways, and being\nhimself faint of heart, he cries in great misery.\n\np. 19\n\n75\\. Having left that city, the departed, threatened by the servants of Yama,\ngoes, with difficulty, in the tenth month, to Sutaptabhavana.\n\n76\\. Though he there obtains the rice-ball gifts and water, he is not happy At\nthe completion of the eleventh month he goes to the city of Raudra.\n\n77\\. There he enjoys what is offered in the eleventh month by his sons and\nothers, and half after the eleventh month he reaches Payovar\xe1\xb9\xa3a\xe1\xb9\x87a.\n\n78\\. There clouds team, giving misery to the departed, and them, he, in\nmisery, obtains the \xc5\x9ar\xc4\x81ddha before the annual one.\n\n70\\. At the end of the year he goes to the city of \xc5\x9a\xc4\xabt\xc4\x81\xe1\xb8\x8dhya, where cold a\nhundred times greater than that of the Him\xc4\x81laya [afflicts](errata.htm#1) him.\n\n80\\. Hungry and pierced with cold, he looks about in the ten directions. 'Does\nthere remain any relative who will remove my misery?'\n\n81\\. There the servants ask: 'What sort of merit have you?' Having eaten the\nannual rice-balls he plucks up courage again.\n\n82\\. At the end of the year, coming nearer to the abode of Yama, having\nreached the city of Bahubh\xc4\xabti, he casts off the body the measure of a hand.\n\n83\\. The spirit the size of a thumb, to work out its karma, getting a body of\ntorment, sets out through the air with the servants of Yama.\n\np. 20\n\n84\\. Those who do not offer gifts for the dweller in the upper body, O\nK\xc4\x81\xc5\x9byapa, thus go, painfully bound in tight bonds.\n\n85\\. Into the city of the King of Justice there are four gateways, O Bird, of\nwhich the way of the southern gate has been declared to you.\n\n86\\. How they go on this most dreadful path, afflicted with hunger, thirst and\nexhaustion, has been told. What else do you wish to hear?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[14:1](gpu04.htm#fr_28) The Ganges.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter III. An Account of the Torments of Yama ](gpu05.htm)\n\n"
