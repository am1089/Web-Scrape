At last the Rajah and Ranee bad some children, and it also happened\nthat the pet dog in the palace had some little puppies; but unfortunately, the\nRanee's two children were two little puppies! and the dog's two little puppies\nwere two pretty little girls! This vexed her majesty very much; and sometimes\nwhen the dog had gone away to its dinner, the Ranee used to put the two little\npuppies (her children) into the kennel, and carry away the dog's two little\ngirls to the palace. Then the poor dog grew very unhappy, and said, 'They\nnever will leave my two little children alone. I must take them away into the\njungle, or their lives will be worried out' So one night she took the little\ngirls in her mouth and ran with them to the jungle, and there made them a home\nin a pretty cave in the rock, beside a clear stream; and every day she would\ngo into the towns and carry away some nice currie and rice to give her little\ndaughters; and if she found any pretty clothes or jewels, that she could bring\naway in her mouth, she used to take them also for the children.\n\nNow it happened some time after this, one day, when the dog had gone to fetch\nher daughters' dinner, two young Princes (a Rajah and his brother) came to\nhunt in the jungle, and they hunted all day and found nothing, it had been\nvery hot, and they were thirsty; so they went to a tree which grew on a little\npiece of high ground, and sent their attendants to search all round for water;\nbut no one could find any. At last one of the hunting dogs came to the foot of\nthe tree quite muddy, and the Rajah said, 'Look, the dog is muddy; he must\nhave found water; follow him, and see where he goes.' The attendants followed\nthe dog, and saw him go to the stream at the mouth of the cave where the two\nchildren were; and the children also saw them, and were very much frightened,\nand ran inside the cave. Then the attendants returned to the two Princes, and\nsaid, 'We have found clear, sparkling water flowing past a cave, and, what is\nmore, within the cave are two of the most lovely young ladies that eye ever\nbeheld, clothed in fine dresses and covered with jewels; but when they saw us,\nthey were frightened and ran away.' On hearing this the Princes bade their\nservants lead them to the place; and when they saw the two young girls, they\nwere quite charmed with them, and asked them to go to their kingdom, and\nbecome their wives. The maidens were frightened; but at last the Rajah and his\nbrother persuaded them, and they went, and the Rajah married the eldest\nsister, and his brother married the youngest.\n\nWhen the dog returned, she was grieved to find her children gone, and for\ntwelve long years the poor thing ran many, many miles to find them, but in\nvain. At last one day she came to the place where the two Princesses lived.\nNow it chanced that the eldest, the wife of the Rajah, was looking out of the\nwindow, and seeing the dog run down the street, she said, 'That must be my\ndear long-lost mother.' So she ran into the street as fast as possible, and\ntook the tired dog in her arms, and brought her into her own room, and made\nher a nice comfortable bed on the floor, and bathed her feet, and was very\nkind to her. Then the dog said to her, 'My daughter, you are good and kind,\nand it is a great joy to me to see you again; but I must not stay, I will\nfirst go and see your younger sister, and then return.' The Ranee answered,\n'Do not do so, dear mother; rest here to-day, tomorrow I will send and let my\nsister know, and she too will come and see you.' But the poor, silly dog would\nnot stay, but ran to the house of her second daughter. Now the second daughter\nwas looking out of the window when the dog came to the door, and seeing it,\nshe said to herself, 'That must be my mother. What will my husband think if he\nlearns that this wretched, ugly, miserable-looking dog is my mother?' So she\nordered her servants to go and throw stones at it, and drive it away, and they\ndid so; and one large stone hit the dog's head, and she ran back, very much\nhurt, to her eldest daughter's house. The Ranee saw her coming, and ran out\ninto the Street and brought her in in her arms, and did all she could to make\nher well, saying, 'Ah, mother, mother! why did you ever leave my house?' But\nall her care was in vain; the poor dog died. Then the Ranee thought her\nhusband might be vexed if he found a dead dog (an unclean animal) in the\npalace; so she put the body in a small room into which the Rajah hardly ever\nwent, intending to have it reverently buried; and over it she placed a basket\nturned topsy-turvy.\n\nIt so happened, however, that when the Rajah came to visit his wife, as chance\nwould have it, he went through this very room, and tripping over the upturned\nbasket, called for a light to see what it was. Then, lo and behold! there lay\nthe statue of a dog, life-size, composed entirely of diamonds, emeralds, and\nother precious stones, set in gold! So he called out to his wife, and said,\n'Where did you get this beautiful dog?' And when the Ranee saw the golden dog,\nshe was very much frightened, and, I'm sorry to say, instead of telling her\nhusband the truth, she told a story, and said, 'Oh, it is only a present my\nparents sent me.'\n\nNow see what trouble she got into for not telling the truth.\n\n'Only,' said the Rajah; 'why, this is valuable enough to buy the whole of my\nkingdom. Your parents must be very rich people to be able to send you such\npresents as this. How is it you never told me of them? Where do they live?'\n(Now she had to tell another story to cover the first.] She said, 'In the\njungle.' He replied, 'I will go and see them; you must take me and show me\nwhere they live.' Then the Ranee thought, 'What will the Rajah say when he\nfinds I have been telling him such stories? He will order my head to be cut\noff.' So she said, 'You must first give me a palanquin, and I will go into the\njungle and tell them you are coming;' and said she would be back in a while,\nand got out, and ran to the ants' nest, and put her finger in the cobra's\nmouth. Now a large thorn had run, a short time before, into the cobra's\nthroat, and hurt him very much; and the Ranee, by putting her finger into his\nmouth, pushed out this thorn; then the cobra, feeling much better, turned to\nher, and said, 'My dear daughter, you have done me a great kindness, what\nreturn can I make you?' The Ranee told him all her story, and begged him to\nbite her that she might die. But the cobra said, 'You did certainly very wrong\nto tell the Rajah that story; nevertheless, you have been very kind to me. I\nwill help you in your difficulty. Send your husband here. I will provide you\nwith a father and mother of whom you need not be ashamed.' So the Ranee\nreturned joyfully to the palace, and invited her husband to come and see her\nparents.\n\nWhen they reached the spot near where the cobra was, what a wonderful sight\nawaited them! There, in the place which had before been thick jungle, stood a\nsplendid palace, twenty-four miles long, and twenty-four miles broad, with\ngardens and trees and fountains all round; and the light shining from it was\nto be seen a hundred miles off. The walls were made of gold and precious\nstones, and the carpets of cloth of gold. Hundreds of servants, in rich\ndresses, stood waiting in the long, lofty rooms; and in the last room of all,\nupon golden thrones, sat a magnificent old Rajah and Ranee, who introduced\nthemselves to the young Rajah as his father- and mother-in-law. The Rajah and\nRanee stayed at the palace six months, and were entertained the whole of that\ntime with feasting and music; and they left for their own home loaded with\npresents. Before they started, however, the Ranee went to her friend the\ncobra, and said, 'You have conjured up all these beautiful things to get me\nout of my difficulties, but my husband, the Rajah, has enjoyed his visit so\nmuch that he will certainly want to come here again. Then, if he returns and\nfinds nothing at all, he will be very angry with me.' The friendly cobra\nanswered, 'Do not fear. When you have gone twenty-four miles on your journey,\nlook back, and see what you will see.' So they started; and on looking back at\nthe end of twenty-four miles, saw the whole of the splendid palace in flames,\nthe fire reaching up to heaven. The Rajah returned to see if he could help\nanybody to escape, or invite them in their distress to his court; but he found\nthat all was burnt down--not a stone nor a living creature remained.\n\nThen he grieved much over the sad fate of his parents-in-law.\n\nWhen the party returned home, the Rajah's brother said to him, 'Where did you\nget these magnificent presents?' He replied, 'They are gifts from my father-\nand mother-in-law.' At this news the Rajab's brother went home to his wife\nvery discontented, and asked her why she had never told him of her parents,\nand taken him to see them, whereby he might have received rich gifts as well\nas his brother. His wife then went to her sister, and inquired how she had\nmanaged to get all her beautiful new things. But the Ranee said, 'Go away, you\nwicked woman! I will not speak to you. You killed the poor dog, our mother.'\n\nBut afterwards she told her all about it.\n\nThe sister then said, 'I shall go and see the cobra, and get presents too.'\nThe Ranee answered, 'You can go if you like.'\n\nSo the sister ordered her palanquin, and told her husband she was going to see\nher parents, and prepare them for a visit from him. When she reached the ants'\nnest, she saw the cobra there, and she went and put her finger in his mouth,\nand the cobra bit her, and she died.\n\n![](img/09.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III.
