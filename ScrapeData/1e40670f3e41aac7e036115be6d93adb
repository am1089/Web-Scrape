It was here that Nityananda--ordered by Chaitanya to take up the life\nof the householder--had dwelt year after year, organising and instructing the\nthen rudimentary society of Vaishnavism. One day, about A.D. 1520, two\nthousand and five hundred men and women, "all Mussulmans," hearing of the\ngreat teacher of love and mercy, had come to him there to receive\ndiscipleship, and been admitted by him into Hinduism, as the order of _Nera-\nNeris_ , or the Shaven-hes and the Shaven-shes. The records called them\nMussulmans because to the writers they were not recognisable as Hindus, and it\nhad been long ago forgotten that there could be any other category outside\northodox society to which they could belong. But they were in fact Buddhists,\nand that memorable day in the life of Nityananda definitely marked the death\nof Buddhism in Bengal.\n\nCould a more fascinating question have been opened up? Within an hour or two\nwe were on\n\np. 88\n\nour way to examine what traces of such events were left in the place of their\noccurrence. The Ganges was full, and our little boat could not always keep us\nwater-tight against the occasional downpour of rain that varied the monotony\nwhich uniformly fine weather would have caused. Near Baranagore began the long\nsuccession of temples and sacred spots that marked that part of the Ganges\nside which was always sacrosanct. As far as this, said someone, Chaitanya\ncame, for is it not true that at Baranagore a house that Chaitanya visited\nstill stands? From this point on we noticed every now. and then a finer than\nordinary _bathing-gh at_, distinguishing some old centre of importance; at\nPanihaty the evidences of a Moghul fort; again, the temple of the White Shiva,\nwhere in seasons of drought the peasants pray for rain, and so on. Still the\nquestion haunted us: would there at Khardah be any lingering sense of what the\ntown had stood for in the past? Would the memory of Nityananda be alive in any\nreal sense? Above all, could there possibly be any surviving tradition of the\ngreat event, of the incorporation of the _Nera-Neris_ into Hinduism?\n\nIt seemed a wonderful story, this of Chaitanya and Nityananda, in the early\nsixteenth century. Surely there is no other country where the waking of genius\nis so welcomed as in India!\n\np. 89\n\n[paragraph continues] The love that was to spread to all mankind began to\nsweep Chaitanya of Nuddea into its whirlpools and torrents of ecstasy when he\nwas eighteen only; and for three years more the foster-brother of his\nchildhood shared with him every thought and enterprise. Then the inner call\nbecame imperious. Chaitanya could no longer brook the ways of the world, and\nsaying farewell to all about him he wandered off, alone and free. But before\nhe went, with strange prevision for one so planless of the work to be done for\nthe world he was leaving, he begged Nityananda to enter the householder\'s\nlife; and this behest was loyally carried out, his adopted brother living for\nthe rest of his life here on the Ganges bank at Khardah. "And so," pursued the\nscholar, bent on expounding his own view, "it is really Nityananda to whom is\ndue the formation of the Vaishnava community, and the working out of its rules\nfor the admission of the lowly and the fallen into orthodox society. It was no\nfall from a higher life that led to the parting from Chaitanya. It was stern\nobedience and a sense of work to be done. This was that Nityananda who walked\nin the city without anger, without restlessness, and without pride. As for\nChaitanya, he spent the next twenty-six years of his life, first in wandering,\nthen at Brindaban, and then in the temple at Puri. He lived there for eighteen\nyears, and\n\np. 90\n\nthere is not a village in Orissa where he is not worshipped. We of Bengal know\nhim as a poor Brahmin. We have his pedigree, and can tell you of his family.\nBut they in Orissa know him as God!"\n\nIn a deep quiet we came gradually to a fine old _gh at_ made of tile-like\nbricks, with ornamental buildings at the top on each side. Near it stood a\ncurious form of temple, made for the Exposition of the Image at the _Ras\nMela_. And further in the town, though hidden from us here at the river bank,\nwe knew that we should find the famous temple of Shyam Sundar, built by\nNityananda himself.\n\nIt was the rainy season, most beautiful of all times for visiting the Ganges\nbank. The brimful river and the fresh green foliage gave an air of opulence\nand unusual beauty. But the great feature of the place one found as soon as\nlanded to be the fine old buildings of the Gossain houses. Unplastered walls\nof brick displayed the exquisite work of the bricklayers, whose construction\nwas of a quality to need no ornament. The houses in the quiet lanes of Khardah\nwere like eighteenth-century colleges in some university city of the West:\nsuch was their air of perfect craftmanship and conscious dignity. We reminded\nourselves, looking thus at the abodes of Nityananda\'s spiritual descendants,\nhow probably the people living here\n\np. 91\n\nhad long forgotten the traditions of their home. Undoubtedly they must have\nshrunk by this time into the tightest shell of orthodoxy. One must not be too\ndisappointed if they should prove the very reverse of what their ancestors\nwould have had them. One could not expect that a great idea should persist, in\nits vigour, for four hundred years together in the same spot. Thinking thus, I\ncame to the paved brick pathway that led to the temple of Shyam Sundar.\nFascinated by the beauty [of](errata.htm#2) the paved way, I followed it and\ncame to the precincts of the temple itself. As much as I could see from the\nentrance I saw, and after some moments was turning away, when an old Brahmin\nentered. "Oh no!" he cried; "come to this place in the _Nat-Mandir_. You can\nsee better here." Considerably cheered by the warmth of the invitation, I\nfollowed his suggestion, while he went about his business in the temple. A few\nminutes later we found the place of the _Nera-Neris_. Sure enough, there it is\nto this day, kept in gracious memory by this very name, the lawn before the\ncottage-home of Nityananda, where the _Nera-Neris_ were reabsorbed into their\nMother-Church. The site of the house that once stood on the grass is now\ncovered with an open veranda-floor, and the room in which Birbhadra, the son\nof Nityananda, was born is marked by a couple of _tulsi_ plants. Here one can\nimagine Nityananda standing, in his\n\np. 92\n\ndoorway, when the whole twenty-five hundred camped before him to state their\ncases and accept his ruling. Beggar-men and women from all the countryside,\nthey must have been only too conscious, many of them, that they were fallen\nand unworthy, in this way or that, and totally unaware of the great name they\nmay once have borne. For many a generation, nay many a century, they had been\nconstantly recruited by the failures of society, who shaved their heads and\ndonned a copper-wire above the elbow, and with this mark of humility and\nreligion, wearing the ochre-coloured cloth, sallied forth to beg their bread\nand impose on no one. Their name had long been held as a term of contempt, for\nwere they not monks and nuns who wandered in pairs? Away with such mummery!\nsaid Bengal in effect. The crumbs from the richer tables were carelessly\nthrown to them, for the Indian people condemn none to starve, but their want\nof order and decency had made them a byword amongst men. Their very name was\nhurled carelessly at a new offender as a term of reproach. How strange that\nbehind the courting of such a fate there is human suffering! The sinner\ncontinued to shave his head and adopt the garment of the order, and to sally\nforth with begging bowl in hand, and yet was keenly aware the while of the\nignominy of his situation, would have given much, perhaps even complete self-\nreformation,\n\np. 93\n\nto have met with a little respect from other human beings. Such was the sorry\ncrowd that had camped on the lawn in those days at Khardah. Nay, as the\nvillagers were presently telling us, even now there are _Nera-Neris_ , and\nuntil lately it was the custom to give them a _mela_ here once a year.\nIncreasing poverty is making this impossible, and some of the older men among\nthe local Gossains spoke of the fact in a brokenhearted fashion, as of an\nancestral trust betrayed. But until a year or two ago the custom was\nmaintained, and even now they are hoping to revive it. Nay, they were taking\nus presently to another temple--not of Shyam Sundar--built at a later date for\nthe express purposes of the mela, and still used by the _Nera-Neris_ as a\n_dharmsala_. This temple has never been finished, and consequently was never\nconsecrated, but it is, curiously enough, built in the old-time fashion of\nBuddhist monasteries, as we see them at Mahavallipore; and this is fitting,\nsince it has to afford sleeping quarters for so many who in name at least are\nof the religious.\n\nThe spirit of Nityananda, then, had not died out of Khardah. Nay, one can\nimagine the beggars--whose feet, in the European Middle Ages, some king was\nwont to wash with his own hands before sitting himself at the banqueting board\n--we can imagine these acquiring in the\n\np. 94\n\nroyal household a semi-symbolic character, as if within the palace beggars and\nkings were specially to be reverenced. And something of this spirit, I\nimagine, I detected at Khardah. The fact that we were strangers, and one of us\na foreign woman, seemed to strike the good burghers as the very reason why we\nshould be given civic entertainment, and presently we found ourselves once\nmore on the way to the temple. They have heard the story of our tastes and\npredilections with attention and sympathy, and now they would show us\nsomething that would please us. They had a copy of _Bhagbat_ , written by\nNityananda with his own hand. Oh, that book! They held It before us and every\nword was a picture. Written with the old pens, on the old paper, with the old\nunfading ink, there was not a letter, not a space, not a word, that was not\nperfect. The very heart of Nityananda--free, sweet, rejoicing in beauty--\nseemed to be displayed before us. But what of the other relic? Of that one\nwould speak, if one could, in whispers only. When Chaitanya commanded his\nbrother to go back to the world, and take up there the life of householder and\ncitizen, Nityananda broke his _sannyasin\'s_ staff. And there is the head of it\nto this day in the temple at Khardah. They brought it out and held it up for\nus to see--the staff that was held in the hand of Nityananda, during those\nthree wonderful years\n\np. 95\n\nwhen he wandered side by side with Chaitanya through the villages and towns of\nBengal, preaching love. We look in a dream at the simple broken piece of wood\n--only the head of the broken staff. But if we could see what you have seen,\nif we could touch what you have touched!\n\nBut Khardah does not retain merely the memory, or the relics, of its great\nhappenings. It represents a community entrusted with a mission. For hundreds\nof years it has stood charged with the duty of teaching the inclusiveness of\nHinduism. And were there not three strangers here, who on this account should\nbe accorded the franchise of the place? Hence we could not depart from the\ntemple till we had eaten _prasad_. All must gather together and eat it with\nus. Hurriedly it was sent for, and quickly consecrated, but already the\ntwilight was falling when we tasted the communion, standing in the transept\nbelow the altar in the temple of Shyam Sundar. All Khardah, gentle and simple,\nBrahmin and lay folk, ate it with us; for all, it seems, come to make\nsalutation at the evening _arati_. To one there it came with a sense of being\n"eaten in haste, with loins girt and staff in hand, for it was the Lord\'s\nPassover": and as, with many expressions of courtesy and respect, we turned\naway from the hurried feast, the bells rang out and the blaze of the light\nbegan for evening worship.\n\np. 96\n\nAnd so we dropped down the river in the starlight, thinking much of the making\nof history here in our close neighbourhood, and feeling all the wonder of a\nplace that had not forgotten its mission in four hundred years.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Holy City](seh18.htm)\n\n'
