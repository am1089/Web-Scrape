Naraya _n_ a said :-- In this Bharatavar _s_ a (India) I am present, as\nthe First of all, in the shape of the Man, at present existing before you. Let\nyou praise Me incessantly thus:--\n\n\n\n2-28. Narada said :-- Thou art the Bhagavan. Obeisance to Thee. Thou art\ncompletely free from attachment and envy and Thou art the incarnate of Dharma,\nJ\xc3\xb1ana and Vairagyam (Dispassion). No trace of Ahamkara (egoism) is in Thee.\nObeisance to Thee. Thou hast nothing of wealth; Thou art the foremost of the\nfamily of Ri _s_ is; Thou art Nara Naraya _n_ a. Thou art the Parama Hamsa\n(the highest class of ascetics and renouncers of the world). Thou art the\nHighest Guru; Thou art happy with Thyself and the Leader of all; I bow down to\nThee. Thou art the Lord of all, yet not mixed in the work of creation, etc.\nThough Thou residest in every embodied being, yet no hunger and thirst can\npress Thee; though Thou art the Witness, yet Thy sight is not at all disturbed\nby the proximity. Thou art not at all connected and no desires can come to\nThee; Thou art the Witness. So I bow down to Thee. This path of Yoga had\n\n\n\np. 765\n\n\n\ncome out of Thee and it is established in Thee. The Bhagavan Hira _n_ yagarbha\nhas given instructions on the cleverness in Yoga, thus :-- That leaving aside\nthe egoism of this body, the seat of all evils, the people at last will take\nresort to the path of Bhakti and set their minds on Thee, Who art beyond the\npale of the three Gu _n_ as. If, like the ignorant persons very much attached\nto this world as well as the next, the wise pass their time in the thoughts of\ntheir sons, wives, and riches and ultimately become very much pained on the\ndestruction of this ugly body, persons, versed in J\xc3\xb1ana and Vij\xc3\xb1ana be afraid\nin the end of their separation fron the body, then their study of the S'astras\nand all their labours become labours merely, without any effect. When such a\nthing occurs to the learned, then O Thou, the Subduer of the knowledge of\nsenses! Thou Thyself givest us instructions that we may easily think of Thee.\nThen this terrible clinging to this ugly body that Thy Maya brings about and\nwhich it is very difficult to discard by other means, will leave us quickly.\nNarada, the seer of all, well qualified with the knowledge of all the Tattvas,\nthe foremost of the Munis, thus worships it and praises Naraya _n_ a Who is\nunaffected by any of the \xc3\x9bpadhis and who corresponds to Nitya and Leela (both\nPermanent and the Pastime-making). O Devar _s_ i! I now describe to you the\nrivers and mountains in Bharatvar _s_ a. Hear attentively. Malaya,\nMangalaprastha, Mainaka, Chitrakuta, Ri _s_ abha, Kutaka, Kolla, Sahya,\nDevagiri, Ri _s_ yamuka, S'ris'aila, Vyanka _t_ a, Mahendra, Varidhara,\nVindhya, S'uktiman, Rik _s_ a, Pariyatra, Dro _n_ a, Chitraku _t_ a,\nGobardhana, Raivataka, Kakubha, Nila, Gaurmukha, Indrakila, Kamagiri and many\nother mountains, that cannot be numbered. Great merits accrue on seeing these\nmountains. Hundreds and thousands of rivers issue from these mountains.\nDrinking their waters, bathing in them and visiting them and singing their\npraises completely destroy the sins of mind, word and body. The names of the\nrivers are :-- Tamrapar _n_ i, Chandravas'a, Kritamala, Va _t_ odaka,\nVaihayasi, Kaveri, Ve _n_ a, Payasvini, Tungabhadra, Kri _sn_ avena, S'arkara,\nVartaka, Godavari, Bhimarathi, Nirbindhya, Payo _sn_ ika, Tapi, Reva, Surasa,\nNarmada, Sarasvati, Charma _n_ vati, and the Indus, Andha, and Sone, Ri _s_\nikulya, Trisama, Vedasmriti, Mahanadi, Kaus'iki, Yamuna, Mandakini,\nDrisadvati, Gomati, Sarayu, Oghavati, Saptavati, Susama, S'atadru,\nChandrabhaga, Marudbridha, Vitasta, Asikni and Vis'va and many other rivers.\nThose persons that take their births in this Var _s_ a enjoy the (Divya)\nDivine, human, and the lower enjoyments, as the effects of their Karmas, in\naccordance with their Sattvik, Rajasik, and Tamasik qualities. All the\ninhabitants of this Var _s_ a take their Sannyasa, Vanaprasthas, etc., in\naccordance with the rules of their Var _n_ as (castes) respectively and enjoy\n\n\n\np. 766\n\n\n\nbeatitudes as dictated (in their S'astras). The Vedavadis (the propounders of\nthe Vedas), the Ri _s_ is, and the Devas declare that this Var _s_ a is\nsuperior to all the other Var _s_ as as the Grace of God is easily obtained\nhere. They say: Oh! What an amount of good works, the inhabitants of Bharata\nVar _s_ a did in their previous lives, that by their influence, the Bhagavan\nHari has become pleased with them without their having any Sadhanas (good\nYogic practices). Therefore we also desire to have our births there, for there\nif we be born amidst the persons there, we would be able serve Hari, Mukunda\nin every way. What will severe austerities, gifts, sacrifices, and practising\nvows avail us? Even if we go to Heaven, what benefit we will derive there?\nThen we would never be able to bring our mind to the lotus-feet of the\nBhagavan Naraya _n_ a. Our tastes for sense enjoyments would increase and we\nwould be wholly deprived of Bhagavan. Far better it is to be born in this\nBharata Var _s_ a as short-lived persons, than to acquire other places where\none can live up to the period of Kalpa and then be reborn. For the intelligent\npeople of Bharata, getting this mortal coil can within a short period devote\nthemselves to the Bhagavan Hari and be free from rebirth. That place is never\nto be visited and served, even if that be Svarga Loka where the nectar-like\nocean of the sayings of Vaiku _nt_ ha are not heard; where there are no\nassemblages of saints who take refuge of the Lotus feet of Bhagavan; where the\ngreat sacrifices and festivities of the Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u are not celebrated.\nThose persons, that do not try for Mok _s_ a, when they get human births and\nwhen they possess J\xc3\xb1ana, Kriya (methods of doing sacrifices and other works\nfor the help of J\xc3\xb1ana) and Dravya (materials for those sacrifices), are\ncertainly like beasts and get themselves repeatedly entanged into bondages.\nThe people of Bharata Var _s_ a offer oblations to Indra and other deities,\ninvoking their names separately, with proper rules (Vidhis), mantras, and puro\n_d_ asas (a sacrificial oblation made of ground rice and offered in Kapalas or\nvessels); but the All sufficient Bhagavan Hari, the Giver of blessings accepts\nthose very gladly.\n\n\n\nTrue that He grants unto the people what they ask from Him; but He hardly\ngives anybody the Paramartha, the Highest Goal. The reason being that the\npeople ask again and again after receiving what they had asked. So He gives of\nHimself His own lotus-feet to those who, having abandoned all their desires,\nworship Him and Him only with the idea of love. (1) Thus :-- We are living\nvery happily in the Heavens as the fruit of the I _st_ apurta that we\nperformed fully; yet we want that we may also be born in Bharata Var _s_ a\nwith our memory all renewed with the thought of the Bhagavan Hari. The\nBhagavan residing in this Bharatvar _s_ a, awards the highest welfare to its\ninhabitants.\n\n\n\np. 767\n\n\n\n29-32. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Devar _s_ i! Thus the Devas of the Heavens, the\nSiddhas, the Highest Ri _s_ is, sing the excellent merits of this Bharatavar\n_s_ a. There are the eight Upadvipas of this Jambudvipa :-- When the sons of\nthe King Sagara were searching for the footprints of the stolen horse (for\nAs'vamedha sacrifice), they found these Upadvipas; so it is definitely stated.\nThe names of out and made these are :-- Svar _n_ aprastha, Chandras'ukra,\n\xc3\x82vartana, Rama _n_ aka, Mandaropakhya, Hari _n_ a, Panchajanya, and Ceylon.\nThe length and breadth of Jambudvipa have been described; now the other six\nDvipas, Plak _s_ a and others will be described. Hear.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Eleventh Chapter of the Eighth Book on the description of the\ncontinents and of Bharatavar _s_ a in the Mahapura _n_ am, S'ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 12](bk08ch12.htm)\n\n"
