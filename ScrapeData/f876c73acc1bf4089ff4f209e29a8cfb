It is Saturday, our\nholiday.\n\nLeave off your work, mother; sit here by the window and tell me where the\ndesert of Tepantar in the fairy tale is?\n\nThe shadow of the rains has covered the day from end to end.\n\nThe fierce lightning is scratching the sky with its nails.\n\nWhen the clouds rumble and it thunders, I love to be afraid in my heart and\ncling to you.\n\nWhen the heavy rain patters for hours on the bamboo leaves, and our windows\nshake and rattle at the gusts of wind, I like to sit alone in the room,\nmother, with you, and hear you talk about the desert of Tepantar in the fairy\ntale.\n\nWhere is it, mother, on the shore of what sea, at the foot of what hills, in\nthe kingdom of what king?\n\nThere are no hedges there to mark the fields, no footpath across it by which\nthe villagers reach their village in the evening, or the woman who gathers dry\nsticks in the forest can bring her load to the market. With patches of yellow\ngrass in the sand and only one tree where the pair of wise old birds have\ntheir nest, lies the desert of Tepantar.\n\nI can imagine how, on just such a cloudy day, the young son of the king is\nriding alone on a grey horse through the desert, in search of the princess who\nlies imprisoned in the giant's palace across that unknown water.\n\nWhen the haze of the rain comes down in the distant sky, and lightning starts\nup like a sudden fit of pain, does he remember his unhappy mother, abandoned\nby the king, sweeping the cow-stall and wiping her eyes, while he rides\nthrough the desert of Tepantar in the fairy tale?\n\nSee, mother, it is almost dark before the day is over, and there are no\ntravellers yonder on the village road.\n\nThe shepherd boy has gone home early from the pasture, and men have left their\nfields to sit on mats under the eaves of their huts, watching the scowling\nclouds.\n\nMother, I have left all my books on the shelf--do not ask me to do my lessons\nnow.\n\nWhen I grow up and am big like my father, I shall learn all that must be\nlearnt.\n\nBut just for to-day, tell me, mother, where the desert of Tepantar in the\nfairy tale is?\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Rainy Day](cm20.htm)\n\n"
