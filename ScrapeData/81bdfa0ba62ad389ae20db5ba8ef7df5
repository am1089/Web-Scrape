Full of devotion like priests with their prayers, wealthy like pious men,\nwho please the gods with their offerings, beautiful to behold like brilliant\nkings, without a blemish like the youths of our hamlets--\n\n2\\. They who are gold-breasted like Agni with his splendour, quick to help\nlike self-harnessed winds, good leaders like the oldest experts, they are to\nthe righteous man like Somas, that yield the best protection.\n\n3\\. They who are roaring and hasting like winds, brilliant like the tongues of\nfires, powerful like mailed soldiers, full of blessings like the prayers of\nour fathers,\n\n4\\. Who hold together like the spokes of chariot-wheels, who glance forward\nlike victorious heroes, who scatter gh _ri_ ta [1](sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:4:1)\nlike wooing youths, who chant beautifully like singers, intoning a hymn of\npraise,\n\n5\\. Who are swift like the best of horses, who are bounteous like lords of\nchariots on a suit, who are hastening on like water with downward floods, who\nare like the manifold [1](sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:5:1) A\xe1\xb9\x85giras with their\n(numerous) songs.\n\n6\\. These noble sons of Sindhu [1](sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:6:1) are like\ngrinding-stones, they are always like Soma-stones\n[2](sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:6:2), tearing everything to pieces; these sons of a\ngood mother are like playful children, they are by their glare like a great\ntroop on its march.\n\np. 417\n\n7\\. Illumining the sacrifice [1](sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:7:1) like the rays of\nthe dawn, they shone forth in their ornaments like triumphant warriors; the\nMaruts with bright spears seem like running rivers, from afar they measure\nmany miles.\n\n8\\. O gods, make us happy and rich, prospering us, your praisers, O Maruts!\nRemember our praise and our friendship, for from of old there are always with\nyou gifts of treasures.\n\np. 418\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nAscribed to Syumara _s_ mi Bhargava. None of its verses occurs elsewhere.\nMetre, I, 3, 4, 8 Trish _t_ ubh; 2, 5-7 _G_ agati.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Gh _ri_ taprush, Fett spruhend, Gluth austheilend, according to\nGrassmann; gh _ri_ ta-spruhend, according to Ludwig. Saya _n_ a takes vareyava\n_h_ as wishing to give presents, and explains that such gifts were preceded by\na gift of water, so that gh _ri_ taprusha _h_ would mean, giving water or\nrain. The real meaning is difficult.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Vi _s_ varupa may have been meant in a more special and mythological\nsense.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Sindhu-matara _h_ may be a synonym of P _ri_ _s_ ni-matara _h_ ,\nsindhu being used as a name of the water in the sky. It may also mean, having\nthe river Sindhu for their mother, i. e. coming from the region of the river.\nBergaigne translates (II, 397), 'qui ont pour mere la riviere celeste. Cette\nriviere peut etre une des formes de la vache qui passe aussi pour leur mere.'\n\nNote 2. The gra\xc2\xb4va _n_ a _h_ and adraya _h_ are probably meant for stones used\nfor pounding corn and squeezing Soma.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. On adhvara _s_ ri, see Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 53.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 43. To Rudra](sbe3255.htm)\n\n"
