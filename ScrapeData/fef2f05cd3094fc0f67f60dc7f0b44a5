The streets of Calcutta\nwere crowded with people. Boys and girls were playing along the way and\namusing themselves by blowing horns and pipes made of palm-leaves. A light\nrain was falling and the roads were wet and muddy. \xc3\x82besha of Ramakrishna.About\nfour o\'clock in the afternoon the Bhagavan came out of Ishan\'s * house and\nentered a carriage which was waiting for Him at the door. Immediately after\ntaking his seat He lost sense-consciousness and went  into that state of pure\nGod-consciousness which He had often called His _\xc3\x82 besha_. The disciples\nfollowed their Divine\n\np. 262\n\n[paragraph continues] Master on foot, for they were eager to be present at\nthis memorable meeting with Pandit Sasadhar, * the great preacher of the\nVedanta philosophy and religion.\n\nThe Pandit was visiting a friend in Calcutta. As Sri Ramakrishna\'s carriage\ndrew up at the entrance-door, He was warmly welcomed by the host and his\npeople. Coming upstairs the Bhagavan met Sasadhar advancing towards Him. He\nappeared to be a middle-aged man with a fair complexion and around his neck\nwas thrown a rosary of Rudraksha beads. He came forward with a reverential\nair, saluted the Bhagavan, and led Him to the parlor which was intended for\nHis reception. The disciples and others went in after Him and seated\nthemselves as near Him as they could. Among the many disciples present was\nNarendra. The Bhagavan, smiling in His semiconscious state,\n\np. 263\n\nsaid: "Very good, very good! Well, what kind of lectures do you give?"\n\nSasadhar: Revered Sir, I try to explain the truth taught by the Holy\nScriptures.\n\nBhagavan: For this age Bhakti Yoga, communion with God by love, devotion and\nself-surrender, as practised by the Rishi Narada, is enjoined. There is hardly\ntime for Karma Yoga, for doing the works laid upon man by the Scriptures. Do\nyou not see that the well-known decoction of the ten medicinal roots (Dasamul\nPachan) is not the medicine for fevers of the present day? The patient runs\nthe risk of being carried off before the medicine has had time to take effect.\n"Fever-mixture" is therefore the order of the day. Teach them Karma if you\nlike, but leave aside the head and tail of the fish. I tell people not to\nbother with the long ritual of Sandhya, but to repeat only the short Gayatri.\n* You are welcome to talk of work to such people if you must.\n\np. 264\n\nEffect of lectures on worldly men.Give thousands of lectures, you cannot do\nanything with worldly men. Can you drive a nail into a stone wall? The head\nwill be broken without making any impression on the wall. Strike the back of\nan alligator with a sword, it will receive no impression. The mendicant\'s bowl\n(of gourd-shell) may have been to the four great holy places of India but\nstill be as bitter as ever. But you will learn this gradually. A calf cannot\nstand on its legs all at once. It falls down, gets up, falls again, and then\nit learns to stand and run. You do not know who is a Bhakta (godly) and who is\nworldly; but that is not your fault. When a heavy storm blows, one cannot\ndistinguish Tamarind from Mango-tree.\n\nIt is true, however, that no one can absolutely renounce all works without\nrealizing God. The question is, how long should Sandhya (rituals) and other\nceremonial works be practised? So long as the Holy Name of the Lord does not\nbring tears of love to the eyes and produce horripilation in the body. When\nyou are uttering "Om Rama," if tears of love come to your eyes, you will know\nfor certain that the term of your Karma (works and duties) is over. You are no\nlonger obliged to perform Sandhya and\n\np. 265\n\nother works. You have risen above Karma. When the fruit appears, the blossom\ndrops off. The true Bhakti is the fruit, while work is the blossom.\n\nWhen the daughter-in-law of the house is with child, she cannot do much work;\nso the mother-in-law daily reduces the number of her duties. As the time of\nher delivery draws near, the mother-in-law seldom allows her to do anything;\nand when the child is born, she fondles and caresses it and ceases altogether\nto work.\n\nAll rituals end in Samadhi.Sandhya merges into Gayatri; Gayatri into Om, and\nOm ultimately loses itself in Samadhi. As the sound of a bell--Ding, dong--\ngradually fades away into the Infinite, so the soul of a Yogi gradually rises\nwith the Nada (the sound of Om) and becomes merged in the Absolute Brahman in\nSamadhi. Into this Samadhi eventually enter all Karma,--Sandhya, Gayatri and\nother works. In this manner the Jnanis are freed from all rituals and\nreligious exercises.\n\nii\n\nAs the Bhagavan was talking of Samadhi, a strange heavenly expression came\nover His sweet, radiant face. He lost all outward consciousness.\n\np. 266\n\n[paragraph continues] After remaining speechless in this state for some time,\nHe came down and like a child said, "Give me a little water." This call for\nwater was the usual sign of His return to the plane of sense-consciousness.\nThen He murmured: "O Mother! The other day Thou didst show me Vidyasagara.\nThen I desired to see a Pandit and Thou hast brought me here."\n\nThe necessity of practice.Turning to Sasadhar, the Bhagavan said: My son, add\nto your spiritual strength, go through devotional exercises a little longer.\nYou have hardly got up into the tree, how can you expect to lay your hand upon\nits fruit? But you are doing all this for the good of others. Saying this the\nBhagavan bowed to Sasadhar and continued: When I first heard your name, I\ninquired whether this Pandit was merely an ordinary Pandit or one who had\nattained right discrimination (Viveka) and dispassion (Vairagya). He is not a\ntrue Pandit who does not possess right discrimination.\n\nThe Divinely-commissioned teacher.If there has been a commission (\xc3\x82desha) from\nthe Supreme, then there is no harm in teaching others. Such a Divinely-\ncommissioned-teacher is invincible. No one can defeat him. If one single ray\nfrom the Goddess of Wisdom falls upon a man,\n\np. 267\n\nit brings to him such power that before him the greatest Pandits become like\nworms of the earth. When a lamp is lighted, swarms of moths rush of themselves\ntowards it without waiting to be called. So he who has received a Divine\ncommission, for him there is no need to seek followers or to make known the\ntime of his lectures. His own power of attraction is so great that people of\ntheir own accord crowd around him. Then kings and nobles flock to him saying:\n"We have brought mangoes, sweets, money, jewels and shawls; of these what will\nyou accept?" To such people I say: "Take them away, I do not want any of\nthem."\n\nDoes a magnet ever say to the iron, "Come to me?" No; drawn by the magnet, it\ngoes of itself. Such a man may not be a Pandit, still do not think for a\nmoment that he lacks in knowledge. Is true wisdom acquired by reading books?\nThere is no end to the wisdom of one who has received a Divine commission.\nThat wisdom comes from God and therefore it is endless. In our country in\nmeasuring grain, one man weighs and the other pushes small heaps of grain on\nto him. In like manner when the Divinely-commissioned teacher gives\ninstruction, my Mother, standing behind, pushes\n\np. 268\n\ntoward him the heaps of Divine wisdom and the supply is never exhausted. When\nthe gracious look of the Divine Mother falls upon one, can there be any lack\nof wisdom? Therefore I ask whether you have received any commission (\xc3\x82desha)\nfrom the Lord?\n\nHazra (to the Pandit): Oh! I dare say he must have received something of that\nkind. Is it not so?\n\nSasadhar\'s host: He has not obtained \xc3\x82desha, but he is lecturing only from a\nsense of duty.\n\nValue of lectures without Divine commission.Bhagavan: If a man has received no\nDivine commission, what good will his lectures do? In the course of his\nlecture a Brahmo said: "Brethren, I used to drink, I used to do this and\nthat." Hearing this the people began to talk: "What does this fellow say? He\nused to drink!" Thus this statement produced just the opposite effect in the\nminds of the audience. Unless the speaker be a good spiritual man, his\nlectures do not help mankind in any way. A subjudge once said to me: "Sir, you\nbegin to preach, then I will also be ready." I answered: "My friend, listen.\nThere was a large pond in a certain village. Some people used to throw dirt\naround the water\'s edge and otherwise defile the pond. Good\n\np. 269\n\nmen of the village spoke to the offenders axed entreated them, but could not\nproduce the slightest impression upon their minds. The offenders continued to\nviolate the, sanitary laws. Every morning abuses were showered upon their\nheads, but all in vain. At last when the municipal authorities put up a notice\nforbidding everyone to commit such acts and sent a peon with their badge to\npunish the offenders, from that moment nobody dared throw dirt near the pond."\nBadge of authority.Therefore I say a badge of authority is necessary;\notherwise no one will listen to your words. A true speaker is one who is\nauthorized by the Supreme and who holds the badge of Divine commission. Every\nman and woman must obey and bow down to him.\n\nA true teacher of mankind must possess great spiritual power (Sakti). In\nCalcutta there are many veteran wrestlers. One must try one\'s strength on such\nmen and not on novices in wrestling. Chaitanya Deva was an Avatara. Tell me\nhow much of that which he did is now preserved? What good will be done by the\nlectures of one who does not hold the badge of Divine authority? Therefore I\nsay: "You must first be absorbed in the Holy feet of the Almighty."\n\np. 270\n\niii\n\nThere are infinite ways which lead to the sea of immortality. The main thing\nis to fall into that sea; it matters not how one gets there. Suppose there is\na reservoir of nectar, a single drop of which falling into the mouth will make\none immortal. You may drink of it either by jumping into the reservoir or by\nslowly walking down along its slope. The result will be the same even if you\nare pushed or thrown into it by another. Taste a little of that nectar and\nbecome immortal.\n\nDifferent paths to God.Innumerable are the paths. Jnana, Karma, Bhakti are all\npaths which lead to the same goal. If you have intense longing you will surely\nreach God. Yoga (communion with God) is of four kinds: Jnana Yoga, Karma Yoga,\nRaja Yoga, and Bhakti Yoga.\n\nJnana Yoga.Jnana Yoga is communion with God by means of right discrimination\nand knowledge in its highest sense. The object of a Jnani is to know and\nrealize the Absolute. He discriminates between the Absolute Reality and the\nunreal phenomena by saying: "Not this," "Not this," until he comes to a point\n\np. 271\n\nwhere all discrimination between the Real and the unreal ceases and the\nAbsolute Brahman is realized in Samadhi.\n\nKarma Yoga.Karma Yoga is communion with God by means of work. It is what you\nare teaching. The performance of duties by house-holders not for the sake of\nobtaining their results but for glorifying the Supreme is that which is meant\nby this method of Yoga. Again, worship, repetition of the Name of the Lord,\nand other devotional exercises are also included in it, if they are done\nwithout attachment to their fruits and for the glorification of God. The end\nof Karma Yoga is the same as the realization of the Impersonal Absolute or the\nPersonal God or both.\n\nRaja Yoga.Raja Yoga leads to this communion through concentration and\nmeditation. It has eight steps. The first is Yama, which consists in non-\ninjuring, truthfulness, non-covetousness, chastity, and the non-receiving of\ngifts. The second is Niyama, which includes austerities, forbearance,\ncontentment, faith in the Supreme Being, charity, study, and self-surrender to\nthe Supreme Will. The practice of various physical postures is comprised in\nAsana, the third; while Pranayama or breathing\n\np. 272\n\nexercises constitute the fourth step. The fifth is Pratyahara and consists in\nmaking the mind introspective and one-pointed. Concentration or Dharana is the\nnext; Dhyana or meditation is the seventh, and Samadhi or the state of\nsuperconsciousness the eighth.\n\nBhakti Yoga.Bhakti Yoga is communion by means of love, devotion, and self-\nsurrender (Bhakti), It is especially adapted to this age.\n\nThe path of absolute knowledge is exceedingly difficult. The term of human\nlife at the present day is short and entirely dependent on material food.\nMoreover, it is almost impossible to get rid of the idea that the soul is one\nwith the body. Now a Jnani or philosopher may declare: "I am not this body,\ngross or subtle; I am one with Brahman, the Absolute. I am not subject to the\nnecessities and conditions of the body,--hunger, thirst, birth, death,\ndisease, grief, pleasure, pain." Such assertions, however, will not make him\nfree from these bodily conditions so long as he is on the plane of relativity.\nHe may be compared to a person who is suffering from the intense pain of a\nwound but who is trying to deny it by mere words of mouth.\n\nWhen the Kundalini is awakened, true\n\np. 273\n\n[paragraph continues] Bhakti, Divine Love and ecstasy are attained. Through\nKarma Yoga one can easily attain to various psychic powers. But when Karma\nYoga leads to Bhakti Yoga, Divine realization comes. Then all duties, rituals,\nceremonials, drop off like the petals of a flower when the fruit has grown.\nWhen a child is born, the young mother does not discharge any other duties,\nbut fondles the child the whole day. As she is free from all household duties,\nso a Bhakta becomes free from the bondage of work after realizing God. The\ntrue Bhakta says: "O Mother, Karma with attachment I fear, for it proceeds\nfrom selfish motives, and as a man soweth so shall he reap. I see again that\nwork without attachment is exceedingly difficult. If I work through attachment\nI shall forget Thee; therefore I do not desire such Karma. Grant that my work\nmay become less and less so long as I do not attain to Thee. Till then may I\nhave strength to do unattached the little work that is left for me, and may I\nbe blessed with unselfish love and devotion to Thee! Mother, so long as I do\nnot realize Thee may my mind be not attached to new works and new desires! But\nwhen Thou wilt command me to work I shall do it not for myself but only for\nThee."\n\np. 274\n\nA devotee: Revered Sir, what is Hatha Yoga?\n\nHatha Yoga.Ramakrishna: Hatha Yoga deals entirely with the physical body. It\ndescribes the methods by which the internal organs can be purified and perfect\nhealth can be acquired. It teaches how to conquer the various powers of Prana\nand the muscles, organs and nerves of the body. But in Hatha Yoga the mind\nmust always be concentrated on the physical body. A Hatha Yogi possesses many\npowers, such as the power of levitation; but all these powers are only the\nmanifestations of physical Prana. There was a juggler who in the midst of his\ntricks suddenly turned his tongue upward and drew it back into the post-nasal\ncanal, stopping respiration. Instantly all the activities of his body were\nsuspended. People thought that he was dead, so they buried him. For several\nyears he remained buried in that state. In some way the grave was opened and\nhe regained consciousness. Immediately he began to repeat the same conjuring\nwords with which he had been casting the spell before he lost consciousness.\nSo the practice of Hatha Yoga will bring one control over the body, but it\nwill carry one only so far. Raja Yoga, on the contrary, deals with\n\np. 275\n\nthe mind and leads to spiritual results through discrimination, concentration\nand meditation.\n\nConcentration.Perfect concentration of the mind is necessary in the path of\nRaja Yoga. Mind is like the flame of a lamp. When the wind of desire blows, it\nis restless; when there is no wind, it is steady. The latter is the state of\nmind in Yoga. Ordinarily the mind is scattered, one portion here, another\nportion there. It is necessary to collect the scattered mind and direct it\ntowards one point. If you want a whole piece of cloth, you will have to pay\nthe full price for it. Yoga is not possible if there be the least obstacle in\nthe way. If there be a small break in the telegraphic wire, the message will\nnot reach its destination. A Yogi controls his mind, the mind does not control\nhim. When the mind is absolutely concentrated, the breath stops, and the soul\nenters into Samadhi.\n\nKumbhaka.This state of breathlessness is called Kumbhaka. It can be attained\nthrough Bhakti Yoga also. When the emotion (Bhakti) reaches its climax, the\nbreath stops and the mind becomes fixed. If a man is sweeping and some one\ncomes and tells him: "Mr. So and So is dead; have you heard?"\n\np. 276\n\n[paragraph continues] The sweeper, if the dead man be not his relation, will\nexclaim unconcernedly: "Is that so? Is he dead? He was a good man. I am\nsorry"; but he goes on sweeping. If, however, he hears of the death of a dear\nrelative, he is so stunned that the broom drops from his hand and he sinks to\nthe ground crying out, "God help me!" At this time his breath stops, his mind\nis fixed upon his grief and he cannot think of anything else. Again, have you\nnot seen among women how, when one of them is struck with wonder either by\nseeing or hearing something unexpectedly, her breath will stop, her mind\nbecome fixed and the body remain so motionless that the other women will\nexclaim: "What is the matter? Have you lost your senses?"\n\nMeditation.At the time of true meditation the body and senses become\nabsolutely still like a piece of wood. When I first saw Keshab Sen in the \xc3\x82di\n(original) Brahmo-Samaj, I saw him sitting in meditation with other members;\nhis mind was entirely withdrawn from the external world and his body was\nperfectly motionless like a wooden stump; then I said to Mathura Babu: "This\nman has hooked the fish." Meditation is possible even with eyes wide open,\n\np. 277\n\neven when one is conversing with another. Suppose you have a toothache. You\nmay perform all works, but your mind will remain concentrated on the spot\nwhere the pain is. Similarly, if you have true concentration on God, your mind\nwill remain fixed even when your body is moving or your mouth is speaking. I\nused to close my eyes at the time of meditation. Then I thought: "If God\nexists after closing the eyes. why should He not exist while the eyes are\nopen?" I opened my eyes and saw the Divine Being everywhere. Man, animals,\ninsects, trees, creepers, moon, sun, water, earth, in and through all these\nthe Infinite Being is manifesting Himself. He who thinks upon God for a long\ntime possesses Divine Substance within him. Through him flow Divine powers. A\ngreat singer, or one who is perfect in instrumental music or in any other art\nor science, also possesses a portion of Divine power. This is the doctrine of\nthe Bhagavad Gita,--"Wherever there are signs of greatness, there is the\nmanifestation of Divine power."\n\nA devotee: Revered Sir, what happens after death?\n\nRamakrishna: Keshab Sen asked me the same question. So long as a man remains\nin\n\np. 278\n\nWhat happens after death.ignorance, in other words, so long as he has not\nrealized God, he will be subject to rebirth; but after Divine realization one\ndoes not come back to this earth, nor is he born in any other world. Potters\nafter making earthen pots dry them in the sun. Have you not seen that there\nare pots which are baked in fire and others that are unbaked? When a pot of\nunbaked clay is broken, the potter uses the same clay to make a new pot; but\nif a baked pot is broken, the pieces are of no further use and he throws them\naway. Similarly, when the ego is not baked in the fire of wisdom, after death\nit will appear in another form and be born again and again. If a fried grain\nis planted .it will not germinate; in the same manner, he whose inner nature\nis fried in the fire of wisdom is no longer subject to evolution, but attains\nto absolute freedom from rebirth.\n\nDualistic and monistic Vedanta.In the Puranas the doctrine of dualistic\nVedanta prevails, which teaches that the Jiva (the individual soul) is one\nthing and God is another: "I am distinct and separate from you." This body is\nlike a bowl; mind, intellect and egoism are like water within it, while the\nPersonal God is the sun which is reflected in the water; and this\n\np. 279\n\nreflection or image of the Divine Being can be perceived by the Jiva in\necstasy. In monistic Vedanta, however, Brahman, the Absolute, is the Reality\nand all else is unreal like a dream. Egoism is like a stick which lies upon\nthe waters of the infinite ocean of Existence-Intelligence-Bliss Absolute, and\nmakes it appear as divided; but when the stick is removed, the apparent\ndivision ceases and the waters of the ocean remain undivided. The knowledge of\nthis indivisible oneness brings the highest state of Samadhi, where this\negoism is entirely obliterated. But the great spiritual teachers like\nSankaracharya * kept a little egoism of knowledge to teach mankind.\n\np. 280\n\nA true Jnani, or knower of the Absolute, may be recognized by certain signs.\nThe signs of a true Jnani.A real Jnani does harm to no one. His nature becomes\nlike that of an innocent child. As a burnt rope retains its shape and appears\nfrom a distance like a real rope, but in truth a breath can blow it away, so\nthe egoism of a Jnani is merely apparent. A child has no attachment for\nanything. It may build a toy house; if anyone touches it, it cries; but the\nnext moment it will itself break it to pieces. So a true Jnani lives in the\nworld, but unattached. He may possess things of great value, but he has no\nattachment for them. In monistic Vedanta the waking state is no more real than\nthe dream state. Parable of a wood-cutter and his dream.A wood-cutter was\ndreaming a happy dream, but being suddenly awakened by some one, he exclaimed\nwith annoyance: "Why did you awaken me? I was a king and the father of seven\nchildren. My children were all receiving education in the various sciences. I\nwas seated on the throne and ruling over my country. Why did you destroy so\nhappy and\n\np. 281\n\ndelightful a state?" The man replied: "Oh! It was only a dream. What does it\nmatter?" The wood-cutter said: "Get away, you fool! You do not understand that\nmy being a king was as real as my wood-cutting. If it be true that I am a\nwood-cutter, then it is equally true that I was a king."\n\nJnana and Vijnana.Jnana is to know the \xc3\x82tman through the path of\ndiscrimination: "Not this, not this." When this discrimination leads to\nSamadhi, then the \xc3\x82tman can be apprehended. But Vijnana is complete knowledge\nor realization. Some have heard of milk, some have seen it, but others have\ntasted it. So with God. Those who have heard of Him are still in ignorance;\nthose who have seen Him are Jnanis; but those who have tasted or realized Him\nare Vijnanis. After seeing God, when one makes acquaintance with Him and\nrealizes Him as the nearest and dearest of all, that is Vijnana. At first it\nis necessary to discriminate "Not this, not this," that is, God is not the\nelements of nature, He is not the senses or sense-powers, He is not this mind,\nnot this intellect, not this egoism; He is beyond all the categories of\nnature. To go to the roof, one must climb step by step, leaving one step after\nanother. The staircase\n\np. 282\n\nis not the same as the roof. After coming out on the roof, however, one can\neasily see that both roof and staircase are of the same material. The same\nInfinite Brahman appears as the Personal God, Jiva, and the twenty-four\ncategories of nature. You may ask why this earth is so hard and solid, if it\nhas come out of Brahman? His omnipotence can make everything possible.\n\niv\n\nRamakrishna (to old Gopal, Swami Advaitananda): What! Do you still wish to\nvisit holy places?\n\nGopal: Yes, Bhagavan, I would like to travel a little more.\n\nParable of the bird on the mast.Ram Babu (to Gopal): The Bhagavan says, after\ntravelling to many places one should settle of down in one spot. This he\nexplains by the parable of the bird on a ship\'s mast. A bird was sitting on\nthe mast of a vessel as it sailed out to sea. After a long time the bird\nrealized that there were no trees around or land in sight. He flew towards the\nnorth to find land, but being disappointed, he returned to the mast, rested a\nwhile and flew towards the south. Still finding no shore, he came back again,\ntired and exhausted. In the\n\np. 283\n\nsame manner he went in all directions, but finding nothing but water and water\neverywhere, he at last rested on the mast and became content.\n\nRamakrishna: So long as God seems to be outside, in different places, so long\nthere is ignorance. But when God is realized within, that is true knowledge.\nParable of a man seeking a light.A man woke up at midnight and desired to\nsmoke. He wanted a light, so he went to a neighbor\'s house and knocked at the\ndoor. Someone opened the door and asked him what he wanted. The man said: "I\nwish to smoke. Can you give me a light?" The neighbor replied: "What is the\nmatter with you? You have taken so much trouble and awakened us at this hour,\nwhen in your hand you have a lighted lantern." What a man wants is already\nwith him; but he still wanders here and there in search of it.\n\nRam Babu: Bhagavan, now I have understood why a Guru asks his disciple to\nvisit holy places, to give him experience and to increase his faith in his\nteachings.\n\nPandit: Revered Sir, how far did your Holiness go on pilgrimages?\n\nRamakrishna (smiling): Well, I went to\n\np. 284\n\nPilgrimages.some places. Hazra went farther and higher up, to Hrishikesha * in\nthe Himalayas. I did not go so far or so high up. The vulture and the kite\nsoar very high, but their eyes are all the while directed to the charnel-pits\nbelow. Do you know what the charnel-pits are? Lust and gold. If in going on a\npilgrimage a man does not acquire Bhakti, then his pilgrimage is fruitless;\nfor Bhakti is the end of all; it is the one thing needful.\n\nDo you know what the vulture and the kite are? They are those who talk on\nlofty subjects and say: "We have performed most of the works enjoined in the\nHoly Scriptures," but whose minds are immersed in worldliness and strongly\nattached to wealth, name, fame, and sense-pleasures.\n\nPandit: Yes, Revered Sir, that is true. Going on a pilgrimage is like casting\naside the precious stone worn on the breast of Vishnu and wandering about in\nsearch of other jewels.\n\nRamakrishna: Again, you should know that although you may give thousands of\ninstructions, still they will not produce results until\n\np. 285\n\nthe time is ripe. A child before going to sleep says to its mother: "Mamma\ndear, awaken me when I shall feel hungry." The mother replies: "Do not worry\nabout that, my child; thy hunger will awaken thee." In the same manner one\nyearns after God when the proper time comes for it.\n\nThree classes of religious teachers.Physicians can be divided into three\nclasses. First, those who, when called in, look at the patient, feel his\npulse, prescribe the necessary medicines and then ask the patient to take\nthem. If the patient declines to do so, they do not care. This is the lowest\nclass. Similarly there are spiritual teachers who do not care to know whether\ntheir instructions have been practised or whether they have produced good\nresults in their disciples. There are other physicians who not only ask the\npatient to take the prescribed drug but who reason with him if he refuses to\ntake it. These belong to the medium class. Similarly those spiritual teachers\nwho not only instruct their pupils but reason with them and gently persuade\nthem to follow their teachings, are better than those of the first class. But\nthe best physicians, who belong to the highest class, use force on the patient\nif he does not listen to their gentle persuasions.\n\np. 286\n\n[paragraph continues] They may go so far as to make him swallow the medicine\nby force if necessary. Similarly the best spiritual masters use force on their\ndisciples to bring them into the path of the Lord. These teachers belong to\nthe highest class.\n\nPandit: Revered Sir, if there are such spiritual teachers, like the physicians\nof the highest class, then why dost Thou say that the spiritual awakening\ncannot come before the time is ripe?\n\nBhagavan: Yes, it is true; but suppose the medicine does not get into the\nstomach? What will the physician do then? Even the best of them are quite\nhelpless. Fit vessels.To give proper instruction one must first choose fit\nvessels. You do not examine the capabilities of your pupils. But I ask those\nwho come to me: "Whom have you to care for you?" Suppose a young man has no\nfather or that his father has left him with debts; how is it possible for him\nto give his heart and soul to God? Do you hear, my child?\n\nPandit: Yes, Bhagavan, I am all attention.\n\nGrace of God.The conversation then passed to another subject,--the Grace of\nGod. The Bhagavan said: Once a number of Shikh soldiers came to the Temple. I\nmet them before the Temple of the Divine Mother. One\n\np. 287\n\nof them said: "God is all-merciful." I asked: "Indeed, is it so? How did you\ncome to know it?" "Why, Sir, is not the Lord feeding and taking care of us?" I\nsaid: "Is that so extraordinary? God is the Father of us all. If the father\ndoes not look after his own children, who will? Shall outsiders from another\nneighborhood come and take care of them?"\n\nNarendra: Then we should not call Him merciful?\n\nBhagavan: Am I forbidding you to call Him all-merciful? What I mean is that\nthe Lord is our nearest and dearest and not like a stranger.\n\nPandit: Priceless are these words!\n\nThe Bhagavan here asked for a fresh glass of water. He would not take the one\nalready offered and it was therefore carried away. It appeared that he looked\nupon it as unfit to be offered to the God in Him, being made impure by the\n"feverish" touch of some wicked men.\n\nPandit (to Hazra): You who live with the Bhagavan day and night must enjoy the\nhighest bliss.\n\nBhagavan (smiling): This day I have had the rare pleasure of looking at the\nmoon of the second lunar day. Do you know why I say the moon\n\np. 288\n\nof the second lunar day? Sita * said to Ravana: "Thou art the full moon, and\nmy Rama Chandra is the moon of the second lunar day." Ravana was highly\npleased, for he did not understand the meaning. Sita meant to say that the\nfortune of Ravana had reached its climax like the full moon and that now it\nmust be on the wane; but the fortune of Rama Chandra is like the moon of the\nsecond lunar day, which will increase day by day.\n\nHere the Bhagavan rising to take leave, the Pandit and his friends bowed down\nbefore Him with great reverence and devotion. He then departed, followed by\nHis disciples.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[261:*](gork12.htm#fr_74) Ishan Chunder Mookerjee was a pious Brahmin\nhouseholder.
