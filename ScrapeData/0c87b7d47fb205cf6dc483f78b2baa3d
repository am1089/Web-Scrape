A man has three Atigurus (or specially venerable superiors):\n\n2\\. His father, his mother, and his spiritual teacher.\n\n3\\. To them he must always pay obedience.\n\n4\\. What they say, that he must do.\n\n5\\. And he must do what is agreeable and serviceable to them.\n\n6\\. Let him never do anything without their leave.\n\n7\\. Those three are equal to the three Vedas ( _Ri_ g-veda, Sama-veda, and Ya\n_g_ ur-veda), they are equal to the three gods (Brahman, Vish _n_ u, and\nSiva), they are equal to the three worlds (of men, of gods, and of Brahman),\nthey are equal to the three fires.\n\n8\\. The father is the Garhapatya (or household) fire, the mother is the Dakshi\n_n_ a (or ceremonial) fire, and the spiritual teacher is the \xc3\x82havaniya (or\nsacrificial) fire.\n\n9\\. He pays regard to all his duties, who pays regard to those three; he who\nshows no regard to\n\n[XXXI. 1-6. M. II, 225, 226, 228, 229; \xc3\x82past. I, 4, 14, 6; Gaut. II, 50, 51.--\n7. M. II, 230.--8. M. II, 231; \xc3\x82past. I, 1, 3, 44.--9. M. II, 234.--10. M. II,\n233.\n\n9\\. \'The father is said to be of the same nature as the Garhapatya fire,\nbecause the \xc3\x82havaniya is produced from it; the mother is said to be of the\nsame nature as the Dakshi _n_ a fire, because it {footnote p. 129} has a\nseparate origin, or because she has the sacrificial implements, such as the\npestle and mortar and the like, in her charge; and the spiritual teacher is\nsaid to be of the same nature as the \xc3\x82havaniya fire, because all oblations\nfall to his share, as the Sm _ri_ ti says (Y. I, 27), "Let him (the pupil)\ndeliver to him (the teacher) the collected alms."\' (Nand.)]\n\np. 129\n\nthem, derives no benefit from any religious observance.\n\n10\\. By honouring his mother, he gains the present world; by honouring his\nfather, the world of gods; and by paying strict obedience to his spiritual\nteacher, the world of Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XXXII.](sbe07034.htm)\n\n'
