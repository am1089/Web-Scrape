(Such qualities as) joy being its head and so on have no force (for other\npassages); for increase and decrease belong to plurality (only).\n\nAttributes such as having joy for its head and so on, which are recorded in\nthe Taittiriyaka, are not to be viewed as having force with regard to other\npassages treating of Brahman, because the successive terms, 'Joy,'\n'Satisfaction,' 'Great Satisfaction,' 'Bliss,' indicate qualities possessing\nlower and higher degrees with regard to each other and to other enjoyers. Now\nfor higher and lower degrees there is room only where there is plurality; and\nBrahman is without all plurality, as we know from many scriptural passages\n('One only, without a Second').--Moreover, we have already demonstrated under\nI, 1, 12, that having joy for one's head and so on are qualities not of\nBrahman, but of the so-called involucrum of delight. And further, those\nqualities are attributed to the highest Brahman merely as means of fixing\none's mind on it, not as themselves being objects of\n\np. 203\n\ncontemplation, and from this also it follows that they are not valid\neverywhere 1.--That the \xc3\x82 _k_ arya refers to them, in the Sutra, as attributes\nof Brahman (while in reality they are attributes of the anandamaya ko _s_ a)\nis merely done for the purpose of establishing a general principle to be\nextended to all attributes of Brahman--also the undoubted ones--which are\nstated with a view to a special form of meditation only; such as the quality\nof being that towards which all blessings go ( _Kh_. Up. IV, 15, 2), or he\nwhose desires are true ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 7, 1). For those passages may all\nindeed have to do with the one Brahman as the object of meditation, but as\nowing to the different nature of the opening sentences the meditations are\ndifferent ones, the attributes mentioned in any one are not valid for the\nothers. The case is analogous to that of two wives ministering to one king,\none with a fly-flap, the other with an umbrella; there also the object of\ntheir ministrations is one, but the acts of ministration themselves are\ndistinct and have each their own particular attributes. So in the case under\ndiscussion also. Qualities in which lower and higher degrees can be\ndistinguished belong to the qualified Brahman only in which plurality is\nadmitted, not to the highest Brahman raised above all qualification. Such\nattributes therefore as having true desires and the like which are mentioned\nin some particular place only have no validity for other meditations on\nBrahman.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[203:1](sbe38155.htm#fr_137) For if they are not real attributes of Brahman\nthere is all the less reason to maintain them to be universally valid. The\nmere means of fixing the mind, moreover, are special to each separate upasana.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 13](sbe38156.htm)\n\n"
