Sa _m_ h. IV, 7, 15, 7), and sprinkles (water) round (the fire) as above.\n\n4. 4 (Then) he puts (four) pieces of wood (on the fire) with the single (Vyah _ri_ tis) and with (the three Vyah _ri_ tis) together, and (four other pieces) with (the following four verses),\n\n'This fuel is thine, Agni; thereby thou shalt grow and gain vigour. And may we\ngrow and gain vigour. Svaha!\n\n'May Indra give me insight; may Sarasvati, the goddess, (give) insight; may\nboth A _s_ vins, wreathed with lotus, bestow insight on me. Svaha!\n\n'The insight that dwells with the Apsaras, the mind that dwells with the\nGandharvas, the divine insight and that which is born from men: may that\ninsight, the fragrant one, rejoice in me! Svaha!\n\n'May insight, the fragrant one, that assumes all shapes, the gold-coloured,\nmobile one, come to me. Rich in sap, swelling with milk, may she, insight, the\nlovely-faced one, rejoice in me! Svaha!'\n\n5. 5 Having wiped round (the fire) in the same way, he sprinkles (water) round (the fire) as above.\n\np. 160\n\n6. 6 He worships the fire with the Mantras, 'What thy splendour is, Agni, may I thereby' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. III, 5, 3, 2), and 'On me may insight, on me offspring' (Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 44).\n\n7. 7 After the lapse of those three days (Sutra 1) he serves in the same way the three kinds of food (stated above) to the Brahma _n_ as, causes them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!' and discharges himself of his vow by (repeating) these (Mantras) with (the necessary) alterations, 'Agni, lord of the vow, I have kept the vow' (see above, I, 2, 7, 8).\n\n8. 8 He keeps the same observances afterwards (also),\n\n9. 9 Dwelling in his teacher's house. He may eat, (however,) pungent and saline food and vegetables.\n\n10. 10 He wears a staff, has his hair tied in one knot, and wears a girdle,\n\n11\\. Or he may tie the lock on the crown of the head in a knot.\n\n12\\. He wears (an upper garment) dyed with red Loth, or the skin (of an\nantelope, &c.).\n\n13\\. He does not have intercourse with women.\n\n14. 14 (The studentship lasts) forty-eight years, or\n\np. 161\n\ntwenty-four (years), or twelve (years), or until he has learnt (the Veda).\n\n15\\. He should not, however, omit keeping the observances.\n\n16. 16 At the beginning and on the completion of the study of a Ka _n_ _d_ a (of the Black Ya _g_ ur-veda he sacrifices) with (the verse), 'The lord of the seat, the wonderful one, the friend of Indra, the dear one, I have entreated for the gift of insight. Svaha!'\n\nIn the second place the _Ri_ shi of the Ka _n_ _d_ a (receives an oblation).\n\n(Then follow oblations with the verses), 'This, O Varu _n_ a;' 'For this I\nentreat thee;' 'Thou, Agni;' 'Thus thou, Agni;' 'Thou, Agni, art quick;' 'Pra\n_g_ apati!' and, 'What I have done too much in this sacrifice.' Here some add\nas subordinate oblations the _G_ aya, Abhyatana, and Rash _t_ rabh _ri_ t\n(oblations) as above.\n\nEnd of the Second Pa _t_ ala.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[158:1](sbe30051.htm#fr_530) 8, 1.
