In this is expressed the soul of nations. In it is left the impress\nof their love and hope, their ideals of achievement and their criticism of the\nworld.\n\nNext to their country, there is no other single factor which does so much to\ndetermine the nature and destiny of a people as their own speech. Races and\nfaiths come and go, children are born, grow old, and die. Each contributes as\nit can to the common tongue, but it remains superior to them all. As its\nlanguage holds the soul of the nation, so in like fashion its literature holds\nthe soul of the language. Each of the national factors wins recognition and\nimmortality from the whole by its power to contribute ideas, characters, and\nforms of beauty to this, the dream-world of the race.\n\nAs one studies an Indian vernacular, the vastness and distinctiveness of the\nIndian dream-world\n\np. 83\n\ncontinually grows on one. First there are the philosophical ideas which give\nits tone to the dream. Then there is the great gallery of ideal characters of\nwhich every Indian child by his birth is made a freeman, that gallery in which\na man may wander all his life without one excursion into formal history: the\ndramatic background, as it were, of each generation of the national struggle.\nThen there are proverbs and fables innumerable, village-legends, quaint\nstories and metaphors, beggars' songs, ancestral hero-tales, cherished\nmemories of saints and leaders, and all the floating literature that makes so\nlarge a part of the spiritual home of man without even incarnating itself in\nletters.\n\nGradually it dawns upon one that behind all this there is some central source\nof thought and strength, a fountain of authority, a standard of correctness\nthat gives dignity and assurance. This academic authority lies in Sanskrit.\nEach of the Indian vernaculars throughout its long history has followed\nsteadfastly in the wake of the classical tongue. All its higher literature has\nconsisted of translations, and even where it has not been direct translation\nthe __motif__ always claimed a Sanskrit source. In that language all the great\nculture of the nation has been preserved. Through it anyone might come in\ncontact with the highest ideas of the race.\n\np. 84\n\nBut Sanskrit is in itself a learned tongue; to acquire it takes many years of\na man's life. The question arises: How has it been maintained in its purity\nand power from age to age? Each treasure is guarded and developed by its own\nsocial formation. What was the society, and what the education, that kept this\nliving? Here we come upon the schools of the Brahmins. It is impossible to\nrealise without some personal experience the definiteness and coherence of the\nold Hindu culture. Even to this day those who live near a family of\nministering priests will hear father and son chanting the sacred texts, hour\nafter hour, day after day, from morn onwards. To the Brahmin even his house is\na school. But still more formal and absorbing was the organisation of the\n_tols_ or schools of Sanskrit. With these India was netted from end to end,\nand men would come from the most distant parts to sit at the feet of some\nrenowned teacher. The New Learning takes little note of university centres\nwhose names are entered in no register, whose students are contented to work\nyear after year for pure love of knowledge, without examination and without\ndegree; where there is so little self-consciousness that no man ever thought\nof making a list of their names. Yet if disinterested love of truth and\ninheritance of deep and complex knowledge be the distinction of a university,\nthe\n\np. 85\n\n[paragraph continues] New Learning with its great colleges and their immense\nrevenues may well bow its, head before the seats of learning of the Indian\npast. Benares and Nasik, Ujjain, Conjeeveram, and the ancient Taxila--to name\nonly a few of the larger and more important of these seats--what pictures they\ncall up to the mind's eye! Not all the provinces are famous for one thing. The\nSouth has kept the memory of the Vedas; Ujjain has held the palm in astronomy\nand mathematics, Benares in grammar, and Bengal in logic.\n\nTo any one of these, from the most distant parts of India, young students will\ntravel, on foot for the most part, and beg, penniless, to be accepted by the\nchosen teacher. One in the days of Buddha desiring to learn medicine went all\nthe way from Rajgir to Taxila, where Peshawar now stands. He was taken as a\npupil by the great master of healing at whose door he knocked, and years\npassed happily by while he worked on, absorbed in the quest of knowledge. Then\ncame the day when his master set him the final test, or as we should say,\ncalled for his doctor's thesis. He was to go out into the fields and bring in\nall the medicinal plants he knew. He went, but after long search he came back\nin great trouble of mind. He could not bring in all the healing herbs, he\nsaid, for all plants were of some use in medicine. And he demonstrated before\nhis\n\np. 86\n\nmaster the value to the physician of each one separately. Long afterwards, it\nis told, when he had returned as a great scholar to Magadha, this youth was\nallowed to heal Lord Buddha himself when he lay ill of a fever.\n\nSuch a glimpse of the ancient university remained as true in the days of\nChaitanya of Nuddea, in the fifteenth century, as it was in the time from\nwhich it comes down to us. Nay, I have heard from an. older generation how it\nwas in their own boyhood, only the other day. It is a marvellously intense and\nearnest life that is revealed to us in the routine of the old _tols_. A\nhousehold of some fifty or sixty students, distributed over a number of mud\ncottages arranged round a central tank, made up the college of a single\nteacher. They arrive at the age of twenty, perhaps, having broken the first\nground of the subject of themselves, and would often remain unmarried till\nthirty-five. In at least one _tol_ that I have heard of, at Vikramapore in\nBengal, there were three students admitted from Maharashtra, for the fame of\nBengal logic went far and wide, and all India knew the names of its best\nteachers. Here in such _tols_ as this was lived out the great ideal of\n_brahmacharya_ \\--the celibate student dwelling as a son in his master's\nhouse.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: An Old Collegiate Village](seh17.htm)\n\n"
