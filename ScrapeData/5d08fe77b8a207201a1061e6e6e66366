S\xc2\x92ri Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Devar _s_ i Narada! Hear now the great\nsecret and the fruits of besmearing one's body with ashes, yieding all\ndesires. The pure cowdung of the Kapila (brown) cow is to be taken up by the\nhand before it reaches the ground. It should not be like mire, i.e., not like\na liquid; it should not be also very hard nor should it emit a bad stench. And\nin case if the cowdung that has already fallen on the earth, has to be taken,\nit should be scraped off from the top and bottom; make it into a ball and then\nburn it in a pure fire, repeating the principal mantra. Take the ash and tie\nit in a piece of cloth and keep it in a pot. The pot in which the ashes are to\nbe kept should be nice and good, hard, clean and sprinkled over for\npurification. Uttering the principal mantra, one is to keep the ashes in the\npot. The pot may be of metal, wood, earth, or cloth; or it can be kept in any\nother nice pot. The ashes can be kept in a silken bag where the mohurs are\nkept. In going to a distant land, the devotee can take the ashes himself or\nkept with his accompanying servant. When it is to be given to somebody, it is\nto be given with both the hands; never with one hand. Never keep it in an\nunholy place. Never apply feet to the ashes, nor throw it in an ordinary place\nnor ever cross it by your legs. Use always the ashes after purifying it with\nmantra. These rules of holding the Bha _s_ ma are according to the Smritis. By\nholding Bha _s_ ma in this way, the devotee becomes, no doubt, like S\xc2\x92iva. The\nashes, that the Vaidik devotees of S'iva prepare are to be taken with\ndevotion. All can ask for that. But the ashes that the followers of the Tantra\ncult prepare, are taken by the Tantriks only; it is prohibited to the Vaidiks.\nThe S\xc2\x92udras, Kapalikas, and other heretics (e.g., Jains, Buddhists) can use\nthe Tripu _nd_ ras. Never do they conceive in their minds that they would not\ntake the Tripu _nd_ ra. The holding on of Bha _s_ ma (ashes) is\n\n\n\np. 1084\n\n\n\naccording to the Vedas. Therefore one who does not apply it falls down. The\nBrahma _n_ as must use the Tripu _nd_ ras, repeating the mantra; and they are\nto besmear their whole body with ashes; if they don't do so, they are surely\nfallen. He can never expect to get liberation even after ko _t_ i births who\ndoes not besmear his body with ashes devotedly and who does not hold the Tripu\n_nd_ ras. O Narada! The vile man who does not hold Bha _s_ ma duly, know the\nbirth of that man as futile as is the birth of a hog. Consider that body as a\nburning ground which does not bear the Tripu _nd_ ra marks. The virtuous man\nshould not cast a glance at him even. Fie on that forehead which does not\ncarry the Tripu _nd_ ra! Fie on that village which has not a single temple of\nS\xc2\x92iva! Fie on that birth which is void of the worship of S\xc2\x92iva! Fie on that\nknowledge which is void of the knowledge of S\xc2\x92iva. Know them to be the\nslanderers of S\xc2\x92iva who mock at Tripu _nd_ ra. Those that put on the Tripu\n_nd_ ras, bear S\xc2\x92iva in their forehead. The Brahmi _n_ who is Niragnik\n(without the holy fire) is not nice in every way. So if the worship of S\xc2\x92iva\nbe not done with any Tripu _nd_ ra is not praiseworthy, even it be attended\nwith abundance of other offerings. Those who do not besmear their bodies with\nashes or who do not use the Tripu _nd_ ras, get their previous good deeds\nconverted into bad ones.\n\n\n\n21-42. Unless the Tripu _nd_ ra mark is taken up according to the S\xc2\x92astras,\nthe Vaidik Karmas (works) or those performed according to the Smritis prove\ninjurious; the good works whatsoever done by any man count for nothing; the\nholy words heard seem as if unheard and the study of the Vedas counted as if\nnot studied.\n\n\n\nThe study of the Vedas, Sacrifices, Charities, asceticisms, vows and fastings\nof that man, who does not use the Tripu _nd_ ra, all become fruitless. Without\nusing Bha _s_ ma (ashes) if one wants liberation, then that desire is\nequivalent to live after taking poison. There is no doubt in this. The Creator\nhas not made the forehead vertically high nor round; but he has made it\nslightly slanting and curved fit to have the Tripu _nd_ ra. Making thus the\nforehead, the Creator wants, as it were, to inform everyone that every one\nought to use Tripu _nd_ ra marks; the curved lines also are made visible for\nthis purpose. Still the igorant illiterate man does not put up the Tripu _nd_\nra. Unless the Brahma _n_ as use the curved Tripu _nd_ ras, their meditation\nwon't be successful; they will not have liberation, knowledge, nor their\nasceticism would bear any fruit. As the S\xc2\x92udras have no right in the study of\nthe Vedas, so the Brahma _n_ s have not any right to perform the worship of\nS\xc2\x92iva, etc., unless they use the Tripu _nd_ ras. First of all, facing\neastward, and washing hands and feet, he ought to make a resolve\n\n\n\np. 1085\n\n\n\nand then he takes a bath of the ashes mentally, controlling his breath. Then\ntaking the ashes of the Agnihotra sacrifice he is to put some ashes on his own\nhead, uttering \xc2\x93\xc3\x8es'ana\xc2\x94 mantra. Then he is to recite the Puru _s_ a S\xc2\x92ukta\nMantra and apply ashes on his face; with the Aghora mantra on his chest; with\nthe Vamadeva mantra, on his anus; with Sadyojata mantra on his legs; and with\nthe mantra Om, he is to besmear his whole body with ashes. This is called the\nbath of fire by the Munis. So bring all the actions to a successful issue one\nis to take first of all this bath of fire. Washing his hands, then, he is to\nmake \xc3\x82chaman duly; and, according to the above-mentioned rules, he is to apply\nashes on his forehead, heart, and all round the neck with the five mantras\nabove-mentioned; or with each mantra he is to apply the Tripu _nd_ ras. Thus\nall works are fructified and he gets the right to do all the Vaidik actions.\nThe S\xc2\x92udras, even, are not to use the ashes touched by the lowest classes. All\nthe actions ordained by the S'astras are to be done after being besmeared with\nashes of the Agnihotra sacrifice; otherwise no action will bear any fruit. All\nhis truth, purity, Japam, offering, oblations to the sacrifice, bathing in the\nholy place of pilgrimage, and worshipping the gods become useless, who does\nnot hold Tripu _nd_ ra. No fear of disease, sins, famine, or robbers comes to\nthe Brahmi _n_ s who use Tripu _nd_ ra and rosary of Rudrak _s_ a and thus\nremain always pure. In the end, they get the Nirva _n_ a liberation. During\nthe time of Sraddhas (solemn obsequies performed in honour of the manes of\ndeceased ancestors) the Brahmi _n_ s purify the rows where persons are fed; so\nmuch so that the Devas glorify them. One must use the Tripu _nd_ ra marks\nbefore one performs any Sraddha, Japam sacrifice, offering oblations or\nworshipping the Visvedevas; then one gets deliverance from the jaws of death.\nO Narada! I am now speaking further of the greatness in holding the Bha _s_\nma; listen.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twelfth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the greatness in holding\nthe Tripu _nd_ ra and Bha _s_ ma in the Mahapuranam S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam\nof 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 13](bk11ch13.htm)\n\n"
