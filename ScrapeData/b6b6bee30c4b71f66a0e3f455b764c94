He (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) now brushes the spoons 2 (with the grass-ends).\nThe reason why he brushes\n\np. 68\n\nthe spoons is that the course 1 pursued among the gods is in accordance with\nthat pursued among men. Now, when the serving up of food is at hand among\nmen,--\n\n1:3:1:22\\. They rinse the vessels, and having rinsed them, they serve up the\nfood with them: in the same way is treated the sacrifice to the gods, that is\nto say, the cooked oblations and the prepared altar; and those vessels of\ntheirs, the sacrificial spoons.\n\n1:3:1:33\\. Now, when he brushes (the spoons), he in reality rinses them,\nthinking, 'with these rinsed ones I will proceed.' He thereby rinses them with\ntwo substances for the gods, and with one for men; viz. with water and the\nbrahman (spirit of worship) for the gods,--for the water is (represented by)\nthe sacrificial grass 2, and the brahman (by) the sacrificial formula;--and\nwith one for men, that is with water alone: and thus this takes place\nseparately 3.\n\n1:3:1:44\\. He, in the first place, takes the dipping-spoon\n\np. 69\n\n[paragraph continues] (sruva, masc.) and makes it hot (on the Garhapatya\nfire), with either of the texts (Va _g_. S. I, 29), 'Scorched is the Rakshas,\nscorched are the enemies!' or, 'Burnt out is the Rakshas, burnt out are the\nenemies!'\n\n1:3:1:55\\. For when the gods were performing sacrifice they were afraid of a\ndisturbance on the part of the Asuras and Rakshas. Hence by this means he,\nfrom the very opening of the sacrifice, expels from here the evil spirits, the\nRakshas 1.\n\n1:3:1:66\\. He brushes it thus inside with the (grass-)tops (cut off from the\ngrass in tying the veda), with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 29), 'Not sharp 2 art\nthou, (but yet) a destroyer of the enemies!' he says this in order that it may\nunceasingly destroy the enemies of the sacrificer. Further, 'Thee, the food-\nabounding (masc.), I cleanse for the kindling of food 3!'--'thee that art\nsuitable for the sacrifice, I cleanse for the sacrifice,' he thereby says. In\nthe same way he brushes all the spoons, saying, 'Thee, the food-abounding\n(fem.) . . .,' in the case of the offering-spoon (sru _k_ , fem.). The pra _s_\nitrahara _n_ a 4 (he brushes) silently.\n\np. 70\n\n1:3:1:77\\. Inside he brushes with the (grass-)tops thus (viz. from the handle\nto the top, or in a forward, eastward direction from himself); outside with\nthe lower (grass-)ends thus (viz. in the opposite or backward direction,\ntowards himself) 1: for thus (viz. in the former way) goes the out-breathing,\nand thus (in the opposite way) the in-breathing. Thereby he obtains out-\nbreathing and in-breathing (for the sacrificer): hence these hairs (on the\nupper side of the elbow) point that way, and these (on the lower side) point\nthat way 2.\n\n1:3:1:88\\. Each time he has brushed and heated (a spoon), he hands it (to the\nAdhvaryu). Just as, after having rinsed (the eating vessels) while touching\nthem, one would finally rinse them without touching them, so here: for this\nreason he hands over each (spoon) after heating it 3.\n\np. 71\n\n1:3:1:99\\. The dipping-spoon (sruva, masc.) he brushes first, and then the\nother spoons (sru _k_ , fem.). The offering-spoon (sru _k_ ), namely, is\nfemale, and the dipping-spoon is male, so that, although in this way several\nwomen meet together, the one that is, as it were, the only male youth among\nthem, goes there first, and the others after him. This is the reason why he\nbrushes the dipping-spoon first, and afterwards the other (offering-)spoons.\n\n1:3:1:1010\\. Let him brush, them so as not to spatter anything towards the\nfire, as he would thereby bespatter him, to whom he will be bringing food,\nwith the slops of the vessels: therefore let him brush them so as not to\nspatter anything towards the fire, that is to say, after stepping outside (the\n\xc3\x82havaniya fire-house) towards the east.\n\n1:3:1:1111\\. Here now some throw the grass-ends used for cleaning the spoons\ninto the (\xc3\x82havaniya) fire. 'To the veda (grass-bunch) they assuredly belonged,\nand the spoons have been cleaned with them: hence it is something that belongs\nto the sacrifice, and (we throw it into the fire) in order that it should not\nbecome excluded from the sacrifice,' thus (they argue). Let him, however, not\ndo so, since he would thereby make him to whom he will offer food, drink the\nslops of the vessels 1. Let him therefore throw them away (on the heap of\nrubbish).\n\n1:3:1:1212\\. He (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) then girds the wife (of the\n\np. 72\n\nsacrificer) 1. She, the wife, truly is the hinder part of the sacrifice. 'May\nthe sacrifice go on increasing before me!' thus (she thinks while) he girds\nher, thinking, 'may she sit thus girt by my sacrifice!'\n\n1:3:1:1313\\. He girds her with a cord (yoktra): for with a cord (yoktra) they\nyoke the draught-animal (yogya). Impure indeed is that part of woman which is\nbelow the navel; and therewith she will be facing the sacrificial butter: that\npart of her he thereby conceals with the cord, and only with the pure upper\npart of her body she then faces the sacrificial butter. This is the reason why\nhe girds the wife 2.\n\n1:3:1:1414\\. He girds her over the garment. Now the garment represents the\nplants, and (the cord represents) Varu _n_ a's noose 3 (ra _g_ _g_ u): hence\nhe thereby places the plants between (her and the noose), and\n\np. 73\n\nthus that noose of Varu _n_ a does not injure her. This is the reason why he\ngirds her over the garment.\n\n1:3:1:1515\\. He girds her, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 30), 'A zone art thou\nfor Aditi!' Aditi, indeed, is this earth. She is the wife of the gods, and\nthat one is his (the sacrificer's) wife. It is for the latter, accordingly,\nthat he makes it a zone instead of a noose (or string). A zone means a girdle,\nand he thereby makes it this for her.\n\n1:3:1:1616\\. Let him not make a knot 1, for the knot is Varu _n_ a's\n(attribute); and Varu _n_ a would lay hold on the (sacrificer's) wife, if he\nwere to make a knot. For this reason he does not make a knot.\n\n1:3:1:1717\\. He twists it through upwards 2, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 30),\n'The pervader 3, of Vish _n_ u art thou!' Let her not sit to the west of the\nsacrifice, with her face towards the east. For Aditi is this earth 4, she is\nthe wife of the gods, and she indeed sits on the west of the sacrifice of the\ngods, with her face turned\n\np. 74\n\ntowards the east: and this lady would, therefore, raise herself to her\n(Aditi), and would speedily go to yonder world. And thus (viz. by sitting in\nthe prescribed way) she lives for a long time, thus she propitiates her\n(Aditi), and thus the latter harms her not. For this reason let her sit\nsomewhat to the south.\n\n1:3:1:1818\\. She looks down upon the sacrificial butter 1; for assuredly that\nwife is a woman, and the butter (represents) seed: hence a productive union is\nthereby brought about. For this reason she looks towards the butter.\n\n1:3:1:1919\\. She looks, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 30), 'With an unimpaired\neye I look on thee;' whereby she says, with an uninjured eye I look on\nthee.'--'Agni's tongue art thou!' for when they offer up that (butter) in the\nfire, then Agni's tongues, as it were, issue forth: therefore she says,\n'Agni's tongue art thou!'--'A good caller 2 of the gods,' whereby she says,\n'well for the gods;'--'be thou for every dainty (or, sacrificial site,\ndhaman), for every prayer of mine!' whereby she says, 'for every sacrifice of\nmine be thou (a good caller)!\n\n1:3:1:2020\\. Having then taken up the butter (from the\n\np. 75\n\nground), he (the \xc3\x82gnidhra) carries it eastwards. In the case of one whose\n\xc3\x82havaniya fire is used for the cooking, he (now in the first place) puts it on\nthe \xc3\x82havaniya, thinking, 'My oblation shall be entirely cooked on the\n\xc3\x82havaniya 1!' The reason why he first puts it thereon (viz. on the Garhapatya)\nis, because he will have to make the wife look at it: for it would not be\nproper, if he were to take it (from the \xc3\x82havaniya) to the west in the midst of\nthe performance, for the purpose of making the wife look at it; and if he were\nnot to let the wife look at it at all, he would thereby exclude her from the\nsacrifice. And in this way, then, he does not exclude the (sacrificer's) wife\nfrom the sacrifice: therefore he does not take it eastwards till after melting\nit close by the wife (on the Garhapatya), and making her look at it. In the\ncase of one who (through death or from other causes) has not his wife with\nhim, he puts it from the very beginning on the \xc3\x82havaniya. He then takes it\nagain from thence and puts it down within the altar.\n\n1:3:1:2121\\. Here now they say,--'He must not place it within the altar; for\nfrom that (butter) they make the oblation to the wives of the gods 2: he\ntherefore excludes the wives of the gods from the company (of\n\np. 76\n\ntheir husbands) 1, and thereby his (the sacrificer's) wife becomes\ndissatisfied with her own husband.' Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, however, said in\nreference to this point, 'Let it be so as it has been prescribed for the wife!\nwho would care whether his wife may consort with other men 2?' 'As the altar\nis (part of the) sacrifice, and the butter is (part of the) sacrifice, I will\nbuild up the sacrifice from out of the sacrifice!' thus thinking, let him\nplace it within the altar.\n\n1:3:1:2222\\. The two strainers are lying in the sprinkling water. He takes\nthem from thence and purifies (ut-pu) the butter with them. Now one of them is\nrelated to the wind (that blows) upwards (utpavana) 3, so that he thereby\nmakes it (the butter) sacrificially pure.\n\n1:3:1:2323\\. He clarifies it, with the text (Va _g_. S. 'By the impulse of\nSavit _ri_ I purify thee with a flawless purifier (strainer), with the rays of\nthe sun!' The meaning (of this formula) is the same (as before).\n\n1:3:1:2424\\. He then purifies the sprinkling water with the strainers covered\nwith butter, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 31),\n\np. 77\n\n[paragraph continues] 'By the impulse of Savit _ri_ I purify you (O waters)\nwith a flawless purifier, with the rays of the sun!' The meaning is the same\n(as before).\n\n1:3:1:2525\\. The reason why he purifies the sprinkling water with the\nstrainers covered with butter is, that he thereby puts milk into the water,\nand that the milk thereby (becomes) beneficial 1 in the water, for, when it\nrains, plants are thereby produced; and on eating the plants and drinking the\nwater, vital fluid (serum) results therefrom: and thus (he does this) in order\nto supply the vital fluid (of the sacrificer).\n\n1:3:1:2626\\. He then looks down on the butter. Here now some make the\nsacrificer look down. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, however, said in reference to this\npoint,--'Why do not (the sacrificers) themselves become (act as) Adhvaryu\npriests? and why do not they (the sacrificers) themselves recite when far\nhigher blessings are prayed for 2? How can these (people) possibly have faith\nin this 3? Whatever blessing the officiating priests invoke during the\nsacrifice that is for the benefit of the sacrificer alone.' The Adhvaryu\nshould accordingly look down on it.\n\np. 78\n\n1:3:1:2727\\. He looks down on it. The eye assuredly is the truth, for the eye\nis indeed the truth. If, therefore, two persons were to come disputing with\neach other and saying, 'I have seen it!' 'I have heard it!' we should believe\nhim who said, 'I have seen it!' and not the other: hence he thereby causes it\n(the butter) to increase by means of the truth.\n\n1:3:1:2828\\. He looks down on it, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 31), 'Lustrous\nart thou! resplendent art thou! immortal (or, ambrosia) art thou!' That prayer\nis indeed true, for that (butter) is lustrous, it is resplendent, it is\nimmortal: hence he thereby causes it to increase by that (prayer) which is\ntrue.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[67:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_207) Besides the Agnihotra-hava _n_ i, or milk ladle\nused at the morning and evening oblations (see [p. 11](sbe1203.htm#page_11),\nnote [2](sbe1204.htm#fn_97); and II, 3, I, 17), three different sru _k_ or\noffering-spoons are used, viz. the _g_ uhu, upabh _ri_ t, and dhruva. They are\nmade each of a different kind of wood, of an arm's length (or, according to\nothers, a cubit long), with a bowl of the shape and size of the hand, and a\nhole cut through the bark and front side of the bowl and fitted with a spout\nsome eight or nine inches long, and shaped like a goose's bill. The sruva or\ndipping-spoon, on the other hand, chiefly used for ladling the clarified p. 68\nbutter (or milk) from the butter vessel into the offering-spoons, is of\nkhadira wood (Acacia Catechu), a cubit long, with a round bowl measuring a\nthumb's joint across, and without a spout. In our text the term sru _k_ is\nused both in the general sense of 'spoon' and in the narrower one of\n'offering-spoon,' as distinguished from the sruva or 'dipping-spoon.'\n\n[68:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_208) The brushing of the spoons is here compared with\nthe rinsing of vessels preparatory to their being used for serving up the\nfood. At the same time, we shall see further on (I, 8, 3, 26-27) that the two\nprincipal offering-spoons, the _g_ uhu and upabh _ri_ t, are looked upon as\nyoke-fellows, they being the two horses that are supposed to convey the\nsacrifice (and consequently the sacrificer himself) to the world of the gods;\nhence this process of cleaning also corresponds to the rubbing down of the\nhorses preparatory to the setting out of the sacrificer on his progress to the\nworld of the gods.\n\n[68:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_209) See I, 1, 3, 5.\n\n[68:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_210) It is doubtful to me whether this last passage\nmerely refers to the several spoons, or whether it refers to the symbolical\nmeaning p. 69 of the wiping with sacrificial grass and the accompanying\nformula. In the latter case it might mean: 'and thus that (act) becomes\ndifferent (i.e. has a different significance).'\n\n[69:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_211) Cf. I, 1, 2, 3, and note.\n\n[69:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_212) A-ni _s_ ita, 'not sharpened,' from _s_ a ( _s_ o),\n'to sharpen' (thus also Mahidh.). If, however, anuparata, 'unceasing,' in the\ntext is intended by the author to explain ani _s_ ita, he would seem to\nidentify the root _s_ a with sa. (so), 'to bring to an end, to finish.' The\nspoon is sharpened by the wiping, cf. Taitt. Br. III, 3, 1, 1.\n\n[69:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_213) Va _g_ edhyayai, 'for the lighting (brightening) of\nthe sacrifice (by means of the butter which is poured into the fire), the\nsacrifice being the food of the gods,' Mahidh. The St. Petersburg Dictionary\nsuggests va _g_ etyayai, 'thee, the courser, I wipe for the race!' Cf. p. 68,\nnote 1.\n\n[69:4](sbe1212.htm#fr_214) The pra _s_ itrahara _n_ a is a pan of khadira\nwood, either p. 70 square or round (? oval, of the shape of a cow's ear, Say.;\nof the shape of a mirror, Katy.), used for holding the Brahman's portion (pra\n_s_ itra) of the sacrificial cake. According to Katy. II, 6, 49, the _s_ _ri_\ntavadanam (cake-cutter) and (puroda _s_ a-)patri (cake-dish) also have to be\ncleaned on this occasion.\n\n[70:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_215) While brushing the spoons he stands east of the\n\xc3\x82havaniya fire-house, looking toward east. The way of brushing, prescribed by\nthe Black Ya _g_ us (Taitt. Br. III, 3, I, 3-4; comm. on Taitt. S. I, 1, 10),\nseems to be more complicated.\n\n[70:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_216) Viz. the former ('aratner uparibhagasya lomani'),\naccording to Saya _n_ a, point in a forward direction (away from the body),\nand the latter ('p _ri_ sh _th_ abhagasya lomani') in a backward direction.\nThe Taitt. Br. III, 3, 1, 4 has 'on the elbow (aratnau) the hairs above\n(point) forward, those below backward,' which Saya _n_ a (Taitt. S. I, 1, 1,\n10) explains by 'the short hairs above the wrist (? ma _n_ ibandhad urdhvam)\nare forward-pointed (pra\xe1\xb9\x85mukha), but those below are backward-pointed (pratya\n_\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ).'\n\n[70:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_217) That is to say, the heating of the spoons\ncorresponds to the usual final rinsing of household vessels with water without\ntouching them. Saya _n_ a.\n\n[71:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_218) The Black Ya _g_ us (Taitt. Br. III, 3, 2, 1)\nprescribes that the grass-ends, after the brushing, should be thrown into the\nfire, and not on the heap of rubbish, as some do; or at all events they should\nnot be thrown on the utkara, without their having been previously washed with\nwater, as they would otherwise bring ill-luck to the cattle.\n\n[72:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_219) The mistress of the house is seated south-west of\nthe Garhapatya fire [with bent (or raised) knees and her face turned towards\nnorth-east]. The \xc3\x82gnidhra then girds her round the waist, outside the garment,\nwith a triple cord of reed-grass (mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a). Katy. II, 7, 1; and Saya _n_\na on our passage.\n\n[72:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_220) According to Taitt. Br. III, 3, 3, 2-3 the\nsymbolical meaning of this act is, that it represents the vratopanayana, or\ninitiation of the wife into the sacred rite. The girding of the wife would\nthus possess a significance similar to that of the ordinary upanayana, or\ninvestiture of the youth with the sacred cord.\n\n[72:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_221) The noose (pa _s_ a) is one of the chief attributes\nof God Varu _n_ a, the symbol of his supreme power and his abhorrence of sin.\nThus we read in Atharva-veda IV, 16, 4 seq.: 'And if one were to flee far\nbeyond the sky, one would not escape from king Varu _n_ a. From heaven his\nspies issue forth to this (world), and with their thousand eyes survey the\nearth. King Varu _n_ a sees all that happens between heaven and earth and\nbeyond them: the very twinklings of the eyes of men are numbered by him. . . .\nMay all those baleful nooses of thine, O Varu _n_ a, that are thrown sevenfold\nand three-fold, p. 73 ensnare him who speaks untruth, and pass by him who\nspeaks the truth!'\n\n[73:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_222) Taitt. Br. III, 3, 3, 4, on the contrary,\nprescribes a knot (granthi _m_ grathnati), as the symbol which is to secure\nall blessings for her.\n\n[73:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_223) He winds the cord round her waist from left to\nright (pradakshi _n_ am), and having fixed the southern end by twice twisting\nround the northern one, he draws the southern end through the encircling cord\nupwards (so as to hang down, uparish _t_ al lambayet, Saya _n_ a. Katy. II, 7,\n1, &c., Scholl.).\n\n[73:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_224) Veshya = vyapaka, Mahidh.; 'perhaps a headband,'\nSt. Petersb. Dict. It is apparently an etymological play on the name of Vish\n_n_ u (? the all-pervading sun). The formula, according to Mahidhara, is\naddressed to the southern end of the cord which is drawn through the girdle (?\nthe pervading ray of Vish _n_ u).\n\n[73:4](sbe1212.htm#fr_225) Aditi is the earth and therefore the altar, which\nrepresents the earth: hence Aditi, in the shape of the altar, looks towards\nthe east.\n\n[74:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_226) He takes the pot containing the clarified butter\nfrom the fire, with the text (Va _g_. S. I, 30): 'For juice thee!' [see I, 2,\n2, 6,] puts it down on the ground before the sacrificer's wife and bids her\nlook down on it. Katy. II, 7, 4.\n\n[74:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_227) Suhu _h_. The Ka _n_ va recension and Taitt. S. I,\n1, 10, 3 have subhu _h_ , 'well-being, good,' which reading seems also to be\npresupposed by our author's explanation 'well (or good) for the gods.' The\nBlack Ya _g_ us assigns this entire mantra to the Adhvaryu, when he has taken\nthe butter from the \xc3\x82havaniya, and puts it down north of the altar. In other\nrespects also it differs considerably from the order followed by our author.\n\n[75:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_228) According to the ritual of the Black Ya _g_ us, the\nbutter, after the sacrificer's wife has looked at it, is again heated on the\nGarhapatya fire, in order to remove the impurity which has thereby been\nimparted to it.\n\n[75:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_229) The patnisa _m_ ya _g_ as are four oblations of\nbutter to Soma, Tvash _t_ _ri_ , the wives of the gods, and Agni G _ri_ hapati\nrespectively, made at the end of these sacrifices. See I, 9, 2, 1. It would\nseem that, according to the ritual of the Black Ya _g_ us, the butter is not\nput on the altar, but on a line drawn with the wooden sword north of the\naltar. See p. 74, note 2.\n\n[76:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_230) Avasabha _h_ karoti--avagata _g_ anasamuha _h_\nkaroti, Say.; the gods are supposed to be assembled around the altar (cf. I,\n3, 3, 8): hence by placing the butter, from which the oblations to the wives\nof the gods are to be made, within the altar, the Adhvaryu would separate the\nwives from their husbands.\n\n[76:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_231) I am not quite certain as to whether this last\nscornful remark is really to be assigned to Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya. The Ka _n_ va\ntext has,--Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, however, said, 'Let him place it within the\naltar!' thus he said. 'Let it be so as it has been prescribed for the wife,'\nthus (thinking) let him place it, whether or not she consort with other men.\n\n[76:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_232) Probably the same as ud-ana (breathing upwards or\ninspiration), which one of the strainers is said to represent in I, 1, 3, 2.\nSee also I, 1, 3, 6; Taitt. Br. III, 3, 4, 4. The St. Petersburg Dictionary\nproposes the meaning 'an implement for cleaning' for utpavana in this passage.\n\n[77:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_233) A play on the word hitam, which means both 'put,\nplaced,' and 'beneficial, salutary.'\n\n[77:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_234) The Ka _n_ va text has as follows,--Here now some\nmake the sacrificer eye it, arguing, 'whatever blessing (resides therein) that\nhe should himself pray for.' Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya, however, said in reference to\nthis point, 'Why then does not he himself become Adhvaryu? and why does he not\nrecite (the solemn prayers of the Hot _ri_ priest), and that when they pray\nfor higher blessing? Whatever blessing the priests invoke at the sacrifice,\nthat they invoke for the sacrificer alone;' thus he said. The Adhvaryu,\ntherefore, should look down on it.\n\n[77:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_235) Tesha _m_ _s_ akhinam atraivaveksha _n_ a _m_ ya\n_g_ amanenaiva kartavyam iti kasmat kara _n_ at _s_ raddha _g_ ata, evam ta\n_m_ _s_ raddham prahasya, Say. The Ka _n_ va text omits this derisive remark.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 2. Second Brahma _n_ a](sbe1213.htm)\n\n"
