On an auspicious day the harnessing to the plough. Or under (the\nNakshatra) _G_ yesh _th_ a, (because that rite is) sacred to Indra.\n\n2 2. To Indra, Par _g_ anya, the two A _s_ vins, the Maruts, Udalaka _s_ yapa,\nSvatikari, Sita, and Anumati, he offers curds, rice grains, perfumes, and\nfried grains, and then makes the bullocks eat honey and ghee.\n\n3\\. He should put them to the plough with (the verse), 'They harness to the\nploughs' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XII, 67).\n\n4\\. With (the verse), 'For luck may us the ploughshares' (Va _g_. Sa _m_ h.\nXII, 69) let him plough or touch the plough-share.\n\n5 5. Or (he may) not (do so), because (that verse) has been prescribed for\n(the erection of) the Agni (-altar), and the act of sowing stands in\nconnection (with it).\n\n6\\. After the front-bullock has been sprinkled (with water), they then should\nplough unploughed ground.\n\np. 327\n\n7 7. He should make oblations of cooked sacrificial food to the same deities\nas above, when sowing both rice and barley, and at the sacrifice to Sita.\n\n8\\.

Indra is the presiding deity over the\nconstellation _G_ yesh _th_ a; see _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana-G _ri_ hya I, 26, 16, &c.\n\n[326:2](sbe29186.htm#fr_836) The names of the genius Udalaka _s_ yapa and of\nthe female genius Svatikari occur, as far as I know, only hero. Bohtlingk-Roth\npropose to read Sphati _m_ kari ('the goddess who gives abundance').\n\n[326:5](sbe29186.htm#fr_837) At the Agni- _k_ ayana ceremony furrows are drawn\nwith the plough on the Agni-kshetra with the verses Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XII,\n69-7 2. Afterwards grains of different kinds are sown. See Katyayana XVII, 2,\n12; 3, 8; Indische Studien, XIII, 244 seq. Thus in the _S_ rauta ritual the\nverse Va _g_. Sa _m_ h. XII, 69 stands in a connection which does not conform\nto the occasion for which it would be used here.\n\n[327:7](sbe29186.htm#fr_838) 'As above' refers to Sutra 2. On the Sita-ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a, see below, chap. 17.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 14](sbe29187.htm)\n\n"
