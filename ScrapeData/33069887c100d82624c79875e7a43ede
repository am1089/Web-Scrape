Creeds and sects matter nothing. Let every one perform with faith the\ndevotions and practices of his creed. Faith is the only clue to get to God.\n\n201\\. He who has faith has all, and he who wants faith wants all.\n\n202\\. The faith-healers of India order their patients to repeat with full\nconviction the words, 'There is no illness in me, there is no illness at all.'\nThe patient repeats it, and, thus mentally denying, the illness goes off. So\nif you think yourself to be morally weak and without goodness,\n\np. 144\n\nyou will really find yourself to be so in no time. Know and believe that you\nare of immense power, and the power will come to you at last.\n\n203\\. Bhagavan _S_ ri Rama _k_ andra had to bridge the ocean before he could\ncross over to La _m_ ka (Ceylon). But Hanuman, his faithful monkey-servant,\nwith one jump crossed the ocean through the firmness of his faith in Rama.\nHere the servant achieved more than the master, simply through faith.\n\n204\\. A man wanted to cross the river. A sage gave him an amulet and said,\nThis will carry thee across.' The man, taking it in his hand, began to walk\nover the waters. When he reached the middle of the river curiosity entered\ninto his heart, and he opened the amulet to see what was in it. Therein he\nfound, written on a bit of paper, the sacred name of Rama. The man at this\nsaid deprecatingly, Is this the only secret?' No sooner had he said this than\nhe sank down. It is faith in the name of the Lord that works miracles, for\nfaith is life, and doubt is death.\n\n205\\. Q. How can I perform devotion when I must always think of my daily\nbread? A. He for whom thou workest will supply thy necessities. God hath made\nprovision for thy support before he sent thee here.\n\n208\\. _Q_. When shall I be free? _A_. When thy I-hood (egoism) will vanish,\nand thy self-will be merged in the Divinity.\n\n207\\. Out of the myriads of paper kites that are made to\n\np. 145\n\nfly in the air, only one or two rend the string and get free. So out of\nhundreds of Sadhakas, only one or two get free from worldly bonds.\n\n208\\. As a piece of lead, thrown into a basin of mercury, is soon dissolved\ntherein, so the human soul loses its individual existence when it falls into\nthe ocean of Brahma.\n\n209\\. _Q_. What do you say about the method of religious preaching employed\nnow-a-days? _A_. It is inviting hundreds of persons to dinner, when the food\nsupply is sufficient for one only.\n\n210\\. Instead of preaching to others, if one worships God all that time, that\nis enough preaching. He who strives to make himself free, is the real\npreacher. Hundreds come from all sides, no one knows whence, to him who is\nfree, and are taught. When a flower opens the bees come from all sides\nuninvited and unasked.\n\n211\\. Hast thou got, O preacher, the badge of authority? As the humblest\nsubject wearing the badge of the King is heard with respect and awe, and can\nquell the riot by showing his badge; so must thou, O preacher, obtain first\nthe order and inspiration from God. So long as thou hast not this inspiration,\nthou mayest preach all thy life, but that will be mere waste of breath.\n\n212\\. He alone is the true 'man' who is illumined with the Spiritual Light.\n\n213\\. The soul enchained is 'man,' and free from chain is ' _S_ iva' (God).\n\np. 146\n\n214\\. The heavier scale of a balance goes down while the lighter one rises up.\nSimilarly he who is weighed down with too many cares and anxieties of the\nworld, goes down to the world, while he who has less cares rises up towards\nthe Kingdom of Heaven.\n\n215\\. God is in all men, but all men are not in God: that is the reason why\nthey suffer.\n\n216\\. There are two sorts of men. The Guru said to one of his disciples, 'What\nI impart to thee, my dear, is invaluable; keep it to thyself,' and the\ndisciple kept it all to himself. But when the Guru imparted that knowledge to\nanother of his disciples, the latter, knowing its inestimable worth, and not\nliking to enjoy it all alone, stood upon a high place and began to declare the\ngood tidings to all the people. The Avataras are of the latter class, while\nthe Siddhas are of the former.\n\n217\\. No man keeps a total fast. Some get food at 9 a.m., others at noon,\nothers at 2 p.m., and others in the evening Similarly, at some time or other,\nin this life or after many lives, all will see God.\n\n218\\. When fruit becomes ripe and falls of itself, it tastes very sweet; but\nwhen unripe fruit is plucked and artificially ripened it does not taste so\nsweet and becomes shrivelled up. So when one has attained perfection, the\nobservance of caste distinctions falls off of itself from him, but so long as\nthis exalted knowledge is not reached, one must observe caste distinctions.\n\np. 147\n\n219\\. When a storm blows, it is impossible to distinguish an A _s_ vattha\n(pippal) and a Va _t_ a (banian) tree. So when the storm of true knowledge\n(the knowledge of one universal existence) blows, there can be no distinction\nof caste.\n\n220\\. When a wound is perfectly healed, the slough falls off of itself; but if\nthe slough be taken off earlier, it bleeds. Similarly, when the perfection of\nknowledge is reached by a man, the distinctions of caste fall off from him,\nbut it is wrong for the ignorant to break such distinctions.\n\n221\\. _Q_. Is it proper to keep the Brahmanical thread? _A_. When the\nknowledge of self is obtained, all fetters fall off of themselves. Then there\nis no distinction of a Brahma _n_ a Or a _S_ udra, a high caste or a low\ncaste. In that case the sacred thread-sign of caste falls away of itself. But\nso long as a man has the consciousness of distinction and difference he should\nnot forcibly throw it off.\n\n222\\. _Q_. Why do you not lead a family life with your wife? _A_. The God\nKartikeya, the leader of the Heavenly army, once happened to scratch a cat\nwith his nail. On going home he saw there was the mark of a scratch on the\ncheek of his Mother. Seeing this, he asked of her, 'Mother, dear, how have you\ngot that ugly scratch on your cheek?' The Goddess Durga replied, 'Child, this\nis thy own handiwork,--the mark scratched by thy own nail.' Kartikeya asked in\nwonder, 'Mother, how is it? I never remember to have scratched thee!' The\nMother replied, 'Darling, hast thou forgotten having scratched a cat this\nmorning?'\n\np. 148\n\n[paragraph continues] Kartikeya said, 'Yes, I did scratch a cat; but how did\nyour cheek get marked?' The Mother replied, 'Dear child, nothing exists in\nthis world but myself. I am all creation. Whomsoever thou hurtest, thou\nhurtest me.' Kartikeya was greatly surprised at this, and determined\nthenceforward never to marry; for whom would he marry? Every woman was mother\nto him. I am like Kartikeya. I consider every woman as my Divine Mother.\n\n223\\. When I look upon chaste women of respectable families, I see in them the\nMother Divine arrayed in the garb of a chaste lady; and again, when I look\nupon the public women of the city, sitting in their open verandas, arrayed in\nthe garb of immorality and shamelessness, I see in them also the Mother\nDivine, sporting in a different way.\n\n224\\. The light of the gas illumines various localities with various\nintensities. But the life of the light, namely, the gas, comes from one common\nreservoir. So the religious teachers of all climes and ages are but as many\nlamp-posts through which is emitted the light of the spirit flowing constantly\nfrom one source, the Lord Almighty.\n\n225\\. As the rain-water from the top of a house may be discharged through\npipes having their mouth-pieces shaped like the head of a tiger, a cow or a\nbull, &c., although the water does not belong to these pipes, but comes from\nthe heaven above, so are the holy Sadhus (saints) through whose mouths eternal\nand heavenly truths are discharged into this world by the Almighty.\n\np. 149\n\n226\\. The cries of all jackals are alike. The teachings of all the wise men of\nthe world are essentially one and the same.\n\n227\\. Whatever gives happiness in this world contains a bit of divine\nenjoyment in it. The difference between the two is as between treacle and\nrefined candy.\n\n228\\. He who is absorbed in others' affairs, forgets his own outer and inner\naffairs (i.e. does not think about his own lower and higher self, but is\nabsorbed in the affairs of other selfs).\n\n228\\. When the mind dwells in evil propensities, it is like a high-caste\nBrahma _n_ a living in the quarters of the out-castes, or like a gentleman\ndwelling in the back slums of the town.\n\n230\\. If a man sees a pleader he naturally thinks of cases and causes;\nsimilarly, on seeing a pious devotee, the man remembers his God and the\nhereafter.\n\n231\\. _Q_. What is the reason that a Prophet is not honoured by his own\nkinsmen? _A_. The kinsmen of a juggler do not crowd round him to see his\nperformances, while strangers stand agape at his wonderful tricks.\n\n232\\. The seeds of Va _g_ ravantula do not fall to the bottom of the tree.\nFrom the shell they shoot far away from the tree and take root there. So the\nSpirit of a Prophet manifests itself at a distance, and he is appreciated\nthere.\n\n233\\. There is always a shade under the lamp while its light illumines the\nsurrounding objects. So the man in the\n\np. 150\n\nimmediate proximity of a Prophet does not understand him. Those who live afar\noff are charmed by his spirit and extra-ordinary power.\n\n234\\. The waters of a swiftly-flowing current move round and round in eddies\nand whirlpools, but quickly crossing these they resume their former course. So\nthe hearts of the pious fall sometimes into the whirlpools of despondency,\ngrief, and unbelief, but it is only a momentary aberration. It does not last\nlong.\n\n235\\. A tree, laden with fruit, always bends low. So, if thou wantest to be\ngreat, be low and meek.\n\n236\\. The heavier scale goes down and the lighter one rises up. So the man of\nmerit and ability is always humble, but the fool is always puffed up with\nvanity.\n\n237\\. The anger of the good is like a line drawn on the surface of water,\nwhich does not last long.\n\n238\\. If a white cloth is stained with a small speck the blackness appears\nvery ugly indeed by the contrast; so the smallest fault of a holy man becomes\npainfully prominent by his surrounding purity.\n\n239\\. The sunlight is one and the same wherever it falls; but bright surfaces\nlike water, mirror and polished metals, &c., can reflect it fully. So is the\nLight Divine. It falls equally and impartially on all hearts, but the pure and\nclean hearts of the good and holy Sadhus only can fully reflect it.\n\n240\\. As in a pane of glass on which quicksilver has\n\np. 151\n\nbeen laid, one can see his face reflected, so in the chaste heart of a totally\nabstinent man is reflected the image of the Almighty\n\n241\\. So long as one does not become simple like a child, one does not get\nDivine illumination. Forget all the worldly knowledge that thou hast acquired,\nand become as ignorant about it as a child, and then thou wilt get the\nknowledge of the True.\n\n242\\. The Hindu almanacs contain predictions of the annual rainfall. But\nsqueeze the book, and not a drop of water will be got out of it. So also many\ngood sayings are to be found in books, but merely reading them will not make\none religious. One has to practise the virtues taught therein.\n\n243\\. _Q_. Why do religions degenerate? _A_. The rain-water is pure, but\nbecomes soiled according to the medium it passes through. If the roof and the\npipe be dirty, the discharge is dirty.\n\n244\\. Money can procure bread and butter only. Do not consider it therefore as\nif it were thy sole end and aim.\n\n245\\. As by rubbing gold and brass on a touch-stone, their real worth becomes\nknown; so a sincere Sadhu and a hypocrite are found out when they are rubbed\nthrough the touch-stone of persecution and adversity.\n\n246\\. The iron must be heated several times and hammered before it becomes\ngood steel. Then only it becomes fit to be made into a sharp sword, and can be\nbent any way you\n\np. 152\n\nlike. So a man must be heated several times in the furnace of tribulations,\nand hammered with the persecutions of the world, before he becomes pure and\nhumble.\n\n247\\. Remain always strong and steadfast in thy own faith, but eschew all\nbigotry and intolerance.\n\n248\\. Be not like the frog in the well. The frog in the well knows nothing\nbigger and grander than its well. So are all bigots: they do not see anything\nbetter than their own creeds.\n\n249\\. There was a man who worshipped _S_ iva, but hated all other Deities. One\nday _S_ iva appeared to him and said,\n\nI shall never be pleased with thee, so long as thou hatest the other gods.'\nBut the man was inexorable. After a few days _S_ iva again appeared to him.\nThis time he appeared as Hari-Hara, that is, one side of his body was that of\n_S_ iva, and the other side that of Vish _n_ u. At this the man was half\npleased and half displeased. He laid his offerings on the side representing\n_S_ iva, and did not offer anything to the side representing Vish _n_ u, and\nwhen he offered the burning incense to his beloved God ( _S_ iva) he was\ncareful as well as audacious enough to press the nostril of Vish _n_ u, the\nother half of Hari-Hara, lest the fragrance should be pleasing to Vish _n_ u.\nSeeing him altogether inexorable, the God _S_ iva was sorely displeased with\nhim, and at once vanished from his sight. But the man was as undaunted as\never. However, the children of the village began to tease him by uttering the\nname of Vish _n_ u in his hearing. Displeased with this, the man hung two\nbells to his ears, which he used to\n\np. 153\n\nring as soon as the boys cried out the names of Vish _n_ u, in order to\nprevent the sound entering his ears. And thus he was known by the name of\nBell-eared, or Gha _n_ _t_ a-kar _n_ a. He is still so much hated for his\nbigotry that every year at a certain period the boys of Bengal break down his\neffigy with a cudgel, and this serves him right.\n\n250\\. As the young wife in a family shows her love and respect to her father-\nin-law, mother-in-law, and every other member of the family, and at the same\ntime loves her husband more than these; similarly, being firm in thy devotion\nto the Deity of thy own choice (Ish _t_ a-Devata), do not despise other\nDeities, but honour them all.\n\n251\\. A truly religious man should think that other religions also are paths\nleading to the truth. We should always maintain an attitude of respect towards\nother religions.\n\n252\\. The difference between the modern Brahmaism and Hinduism is like the\ndifference between the single note of music and the whole music. The modern\nBrahmas are content with the single note of Brahman, while the Hindu religion\nis made up of several notes producing a sweet and melodious harmony.\n\n253\\. Some years ago, when the Hindus and the Brahmas were preaching their\nrespective religions with true earnestness and great zeal, some one asked\nBhagavan _S_ ri Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a his opinion about both parties, on which\nhe replied, I see that my Mother Divine is getting her work done through both\nparties.'\n\np. 154\n\n254\\. Hari (from h _ri_ , to steal) means 'He who steals our hearts,' and\nHaribala means 'Hari is our strength.'\n\n255\\. Sin like quicksilver can never be kept concealed. (When a man takes\ncalomel, sooner or later it is sure to show itself in the shape of eruptions\non the skin.)\n\n256\\. The tears of repentance and the tears of happiness flow from the two\ndifferent corners of the eye. The tears of repentance flow from the side near\nthe nose, and the tears of happiness flow from the other extremity.\n\n257\\. Visit not miracle workers. They are wanderers from the path of truth.\nTheir minds have become entangled in the meshes of psychic powers, which lie\nin the way of the pilgrim towards Brahman, as temptations. Beware of these\npowers, and desire them not.\n\n258\\. A man after fourteen years of hard asceticism in a lonely forest\nobtained at last the power of walking over the waters. Overjoyed at this\nacquisition, he went to his Guru, and told him of his grand feat. At this the\nMaster replied, 'My poor boy, what thou hast accomplished after fourteen\nyears' arduous labour, ordinary men do the same by paying a penny to the\nboatman.'\n\n259\\. A youthful disciple of _S_ ri Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a once acquired the\npower of reading the heart of another. When he related this experience to the\nMaster, he rebuked him and said, 'Shame on thee, child, do not waste thy\nenergies on these petty things.'\n\n260\\. A washerman keeps a large store of clothes and has\n\np. 155\n\na rich wardrobe, but these are not his. As soon as the clothes are washed his\nwardrobe becomes empty. Men having no original thoughts of their own are like\nthe washerman.\n\n261\\. Greed brings woe, while contentment is all happiness. A barber was once\npassing under a haunted tree when he heard a voice say, 'Wilt thou accept of\nseven jars of gold?' The barber looked round, but could see no one. The\nmysterious voice again repeated the words, and the cupidity of the barber\nbeing greatly roused by the spontaneous offer of such vast wealth he spoke\naloud, 'When the merciful God is so good as to take pity even on a poor barber\nlike me, is there anything to be said as to my accepting the kind offer so\ngenerously made?' At once the reply came, 'Go home, I have already carried the\njars thither.' The barber ran in hot haste to his house, and was transported\nto see the promised jars there. He opened them one after another and saw them\nall filled, save one which was half filled. Now arose the desire of filling\nthis last jar in the heart of the barber. So he sold all his gold and silver\nornaments and converted them into coins and threw them into the jar. But the\njar still remained empty. He now began to starve himself and his family by\nliving upon insufficient, coarse, and cheap food, throwing all his savings\ninto the jar, but the jar remained as empty as ever. The barber then requested\nthe King to increase his pay as it was not sufficient to maintain him and his\nfamily. As he was a favourite of the King, the latter granted his request.\n\np. 156\n\n[paragraph continues] The barber now began to save all his pay and emoluments,\nand throw them all into the jar, but the greedy jar showed no sign of being\nfilled. He now began to live by begging, and became as wretched and miserable\nas ever. One day the King seeing his sad plight, inquired of him by saying,\n'Hallo! when thy pay was half of what thou gettest now, thou wast far happier\nand more cheerful, contented, and healthy, but with double that pay I see thee\nmorose, care-worn, and dejected. Now what is the matter with thee? Hast thou\naccepted the seven jars of gold?' The barber was taken aback by this home-\nthrust, and with clasped hands asked the King as to who had informed his\nmajesty about the matter. The King answered, 'Whosoever accepts the riches of\na Yaksha is sure to be reduced to such an abject and wretched plight. I have\nknown thee through this invariable sign. Do away with the money at once. Thou\ncanst not spend a farthing of it. That money is for hoarding and not for\nspending.' The barber was brought to his senses by this advice and went to the\nhaunted tree and said, 'O Yaksha, take back thy gold,' and he returned home to\nfind the seven jars vanished, taking with them his life-long savings.\nNevertheless he began to live happily after it.\n\n262\\. It is very pleasant to scratch a ringworm, but the after-sensation is\nvery painful and intolerable; so the pleasures of the world are very pleasant\nin the beginning, but their after-consequences are very terrible to\ncontemplate.\n\np. 157\n\n263\\. _Q_. What is the world like? _A_. It is like an \xc3\x82mla fruit, all skin and\nstone with but very little pulp, the eating of which produces colic.\n\n264\\. Like unto a miser that longeth after gold, let thy heart pant after Him.\n\n265\\. So long as the heavenly expanse of the heart is troubled and disturbed\nby the gusts of desire, there is little chance of our beholding therein the\nbrightness of God. The beatific vision occurs only in the heart which is calm\nand rapt up in divine communion.\n\n266\\. The soiled mirror never reflects the rays of the sun, and the impure and\nunclean in heart who are subject to Maya (illusion) never perceive the glory\nof the Bhagavan (the Venerable). But the pure in heart see the Lord, as the\nclear mirror reflects the sun. Be holy, then.\n\n267\\. As on the troubled surface of rolling waters the moon shines in broken\nimages, so on the unsettled mind of a worldly man engrossed in Maya, the\nperfect God shines with partial light only.\n\n268\\. Why does a Bhakta (one full of the love of God) forsake everything for\nthe sake of God? An insect flies from the darkness as soon as any light meets\nits eyes; the ant loses its life in molasses, but never leaves them. So the\nBhakta cleaves unto his God for ever, and leaves all else.\n\n269\\. As one can ascend to the top of a house by means of a ladder or a bamboo\nor a staircase or a rope, so diverse\n\np. 158\n\nalso are the ways and means to approach God, and every religion in the world\nshows one of these ways.\n\n270\\. If God is Omnipresent, why do we not see Him? Standing by the bank of a\npool thickly overspread with scum and weeds, you will say that there is no\nwater in it. If you desire to see the water, remove the scum from the surface\nof the pond. With eyes covered with the film of Maya you complain that you\ncannot see God. If you wish to see Him, remove the film of Maya from off your\neyes.\n\n271\\. Why cannot we see the Divine Mother? She is like a high-born lady\ntransacting all her business from behind the screen, seeing all, but seen by\nnone. Her devout sons only see Her, by going near Her and behind the screen of\nMaya.\n\n272\\. Dispute not. As you rest firmly on your own faith, allow others also the\nsame liberty to stand by their own faiths. By mere disputation you shall never\nsucceed in convincing another of his error. When the grace of God descends on\nhim, every one will understand his own mistakes.\n\n273\\. A husbandman was watering a sugar-cane field the whole of a day. After\nfinishing his task he saw that not a drop of water had entered the field; all\nthe water had gone underground through several big rat-holes. Such is the\nstate of that devotee who, cherishing secretly in his heart worldly desires\n(of fame, pleasures, and comforts) and ambitions, worships God. Though daily\npraying, he\n\np. 159\n\nmakes no progress because the entire devotion runs to waste through the rat-\nholes of his desires, and at the end of his life-long devotion he is the same\nman as before, and has not advanced one step.\n\n274\\. Keep thyself aloof at the time of thy devotion from those who scoff, and\nthose who ridicule piety and the pious.\n\n275\\. Is it good to create sects? (Here is a pun on the word 'Dal,' which\nmeans both a 'sect' or 'party' as well as 'the rank growth on the surface of a\nstagnant pool.') The 'Dal' cannot grow in a current of water: it grows only in\nthe stagnant waters of petty pools. He whose heart earnestly longs after the\nDeity has no time for anything else. He who looks for fame and honour, forms\nsects (Dal). (Cf. 105.)\n\n278\\. The Vedas, Tantras, and the Pura _n_ as, and all the sacred scriptures\nof the world, have become as if defiled (as food thrown out of the mouth\nbecomes polluted): because they have been constantly repeated by and have come\nout of human mouths. But the Brahman or the Absolute has never been defiled,\nfor no one as yet has been able to express Him by human speech.\n\n277\\. The parable of a Brahman and his low-caste servant:\n\nAs soon as Maya is found out, she flies away. A priest was once going to the\nvillage of a disciple. He had no servant with him. On the way, seeing a\ncobbler, he addressed him, saying, 'Hallo! good man, wilt thou accompany me as\na servant? Thou shalt dine well and\n\np. 160\n\nwilt be cared for; come along.' The cobbler replied, Reverend Sir, I am of the\nlowest caste, how can I represent your servant?' The priest said, 'Never mind\nthat. Do not tell anybody what thou art, nor speak to or make acquaintance\nwith any one.' The cobbler agreed. At twilight, while the priest was sitting\nat prayers in the house of his disciple, another Brahman came and addressed\nthe priest's servant, 'Fellow, go and bring my shoes from there.' The servant,\ntrue to the words of his master, made no response. The Brahman repeated the\norder a second time, but the servant remained silent. The Brahman repeated it\nagain and again, but the cobbler moved not an inch. At last, getting annoyed,\nthe Brahman angrily said, 'Hallo Sirrah! How darest thou not obey a Brahman's\ncommand! What is thy caste? Art thou not a cobbler?' The cobbler hearing this\nbegan to tremble with fear, and piteously looking at the priest said, '0\nvenerable Sir, O venerable Sir! I am found out. I cannot stay here any longer,\nlet me flee.' So saying he took to his heels.\n\n278\\. What is the relation between _G_ ivatman and Paramatman, the personal\nand the Highest Self?\n\nAs when a plank of wood is stretched across a current of water, the water\nseems to be divided into two, so the indivisible appears divided into two by\nlimitations (Upadhi) of Maya. In truth they are one and the same.\n\n279\\. There is little chance of a ship running astray, so long as its compass\npoints towards the true North. So if the mind of man--the compass-needle of\nthe ship of life\n\np. 161\n\nis turned always towards the Parabrahman without oscillation, it will steer\nclear of every danger.\n\n280\\. The Avadhuta saw a bridal procession passing through a meadow, with the\nbeating of drums and the blowing of trumpets, and with great pomp. Hard by the\nroad through which the procession was passing he saw a hunter deeply absorbed\nin aiming at a bird, and perfectly inattentive to the noise and pomp of the\nprocession, casting not even a passing look at it. The Avadhuta, saluting the\nhunter, said, 'Sir, you are my Guru. When I sit in meditation let my mind be\nconcentrated on its object of meditation as yours has been on the bird.'\n\n281\\. An angler was fishing in a pond. The Avadhuta, approaching him, asked,\n'Brother, which way leads to such and such a place?' The float of the rod at\nthat time was indicating that the fish was nibbling the bait: so the man did\nnot give any reply, but was all attention to his fishing-rod. When the fish\nwas caught, he turned round and said, 'What is it you have been saying, sir?'\nThe Avadhuta saluted him and said, 'Sir, you are my Guru. When I sit in the\ncontemplation of the Paramatman, let me follow your example, and before\nfinishing my devotions let me not attend to anything else.'\n\n282\\. A heron was slowly walking to catch a fish. Behind, there was a hunter\naiming an arrow at it; but the bird was totally unmindful of this fact. The\nAvadhuta, saluting the heron, said, 'When I sit in meditation let me\n\np. 162\n\nfollow your example, and never turn back to see who is behind me.'\n\n283\\. A kite with a fish in its beak was followed by a host of crows and other\nkites, which were screeching and pecking at it, and were trying to snatch the\nfish away. In whatever direction it went the crowd of kites and crows followed\nit, screeching and cawing. Getting tired of this annoyance, the kite let go\nthe fish, when it was instantly caught by another kite, and at once the crowd\nof kites and crows transferred their kind attentions to the new owner of the\nfish. The first kite was left unmolested, and sat calmly on the branch of a\ntree. Seeing this quiet and tranquil state of the bird the Avadhuta, saluting\nit, said, 'You are my Guru, O Kite; for you have taught me that so long as man\ndoes not throw off the burden of the worldly desires he carries, he cannot be\nundisturbed and at peace with himself.'\n\n284\\. The human Guru whispers the sacred formula into the ear; the Divine Guru\nbreathes the spirit into the soul.\n\n285\\. If thou wishest to thread the needle, make the thread pointed, and\nremove all extraneous fibres. Then the thread will easily enter into the eye\nof the needle. So if thou wishest to concentrate thy heart on God, be meek,\nhumble, and poor in spirit, and remove all filaments of desire.\n\n286\\. A snake dwelt in a certain place. No one dared to pass by that way. For\nwhoever did so was instantaneously\n\np. 163\n\nbitten to death. Once a Mahatman passed by that road, and the serpent ran\nafter the sage in order to bite him. But when the snake approached the holy\nman he lost all his ferocity, and was overpowered by the gentleness of the\nYogin. Seeing the snake, the sage said, 'Well, friend, thinkest thou to bite\nme?' The snake was abashed and made no reply. At this the sage said, 'Hearken,\nfriend, do not injure anybody in future.' The snake bowed and nodded assent.\nThe sage went his own way and the snake entered his hole, and thenceforward\nbegan to live a life of innocence and purity without even attempting to harm\nany one. In a few days all the neighbourhood began to think that the snake had\nlost all his venom, and was no more dangerous, and so every one began to tease\nhim. Some pelted him, others dragged him mercilessly by the tail, and in this\nway there was no end to his troubles. Fortunately the sage again passed by\nthat way, and seeing the bruised and battered condition of the good snake, was\nvery much moved, and inquired the cause of his distress. At this the snake\nreplied, 'Holy sir, this is because I do not injure any one, after your\nadvice. But alas! they are so merciless!' The sage smilingly said, 'My dear\nfriend, I simply advised you not to bite any one, but I did not tell you not\nto frighten others. Although you should not bite any creature, still you\nshould keep every one at a considerable distance by hissing at him.'\n\nSimilarly, if thou livest in the world, make thyself feared and respected. Do\nnot injure any one, but be not, at the same time, injured by others.\n\np. 164\n\n287\\. When the bird has flown away from it, one cares no longer for the cage.\nSo when the bird of life has flown away, no one cares any longer for the\ncarcase.\n\n288\\. As a lamp does not burn without oil, so a man cannot live without God.\n\n289, 290. A learned Brahman once went over to a wise king and said, 'Hear, O\nking, I am well versed in the holy scriptures. I intend to teach thee the holy\nbook of the Bhagavata.' The king, who was the wiser of the two, well knew that\na man who has read the Bhagavata would seek more to know his own Self than\nhonour and wealth in a king's court. He replied, 'I see, O Brahman, that you\nyourself have not mastered that book thoroughly. I promise to make you my\ntutor, but go first and learn the scripture well.' The Brahman went his way,\nthinking within himself, 'How foolish the king is to say I have not mastered\nthe Bhagavata well, when I have been reading the book over and over again for\nall these years.' However, he went over the book carefully once more and\nappeared before the king. The king told him the same thing again and sent him\naway. The Brahman was sore vexed, but thought there must be some meaning for\nthis behaviour of the king. He went home, shut himself up in his closet, and\napplied himself more than ever to the study of the book. By and by the hidden\nmeanings began to flash before his intellect; the vanity of running after the\nbubbles, riches and honour, kings and courts, wealth and fame, all vanished\nbefore his unclouded vision. From that day forward he gave\n\np. 165\n\nhimself up entirely to attain perfection by the worship of God, and never\nreturned to the king. A few years after the king thought of the Brahman, and\nwent to his house to see what he was about. Seeing the Brahman, all radiant\nwith the divine light and love, he fell upon his knees and said, 'I see you\nhave now arrived at the true meaning of the scriptures; I am ready to be your\ndisciple, if you will duly condescend to make me one.'\n\n291\\. As long as there is no breeze blowing, we fan ourselves to alleviate\nheat, but when the breeze blows both for rich and poor, we give up fanning. We\nshould persevere ourselves to reach our final goal as long as there is no help\nfrom above; but when that help comes to any, let him then stop labouring and\npersevering; otherwise not.\n\n292\\. _Q_. Where is God? How can we get to Him? _A_. There are pearls in the\nsea, you must dive deep again and again until you get the pearls. So there is\nGod in the world, but you should persevere to see Him.\n\n293\\. How does the soul stay in the body? As the piston stays in a syringe.\n\n294\\. As in mid-ocean a bird, which found its perch upon the topmast of a\nship, getting tired of its position, flies away to discover a new place of\nrest for itself, and alas! without finding any, returns at last to its old\nroost upon the masthead, weary and exhausted; so when an ordinary aspirant,\nbeing disgusted with the monotony of the task and the discipline imposed upon\nhim by his well-wishing and thoroughly experienced preceptor (Guru),\n\np. 166\n\nloses all hope, and, having no confidence in him, launches forth into the\nbroad world ever in search of a new adviser, he is sure at last to return to\nhis original master after a fruitless search, which has, however, increased\nthe reverence of the repentant aspirant for the master.\n\n295\\. In the month of June a young goat was playing near his mother, when,\nwith a merry frisk, he told her that he meant to make a feast of Ras-flowers,\na species of flowers budding abundantly during the time of the Raslila\nfestival. 'Well, my darling,' replied the dam, 'it is not such an easy thing\nas you seem to think. You will have to pass through many crises before you can\nhope to feast on Ras-flowers. The interval between the coming September and\nOctober is not very auspicious to you; for some one may take you for a\nsacrifice to the Goddess Durga; then, again, you will have to get through the\ntime of Kali-pu _g_ a, and if you are fortunate enough to escape through that\nperiod, there comes the _G_ agaddhat _ri_ -pu _g_ a, when almost all the\nsurviving male members of our tribe are destroyed. If your good luck leads you\nsafe and sound through all these crises, then you can hope to make a feast of\nRas-flowers in the beginning of November.' Like the dam in the fable, we\nshould not hastily approve of all the aspirations which our youthful hopes may\nentertain, remembering the manifold crises which one will have to pass through\nin the course of one's life.\n\n296\\. As the fly sits, now on the unclean sore of the human body, and now on\nthe offerings dedicated to the\n\np. 167\n\ngods, so the mind of the worldly man is at one time deeply engaged in\nreligious topics and at the next moment loses itself in the pleasures of\nwealth and lust.\n\n297\\. As the rain-water falling upon the roof of a house Rows down to the\nground through spouts grotesquely shaped like the tiger's head, thus seeming\nto come out of tigers' mouths, while in reality it descends from the sky; even\nso are the holy instructions that come out of the mouths of godly men, which\nseem to be uttered by those men themselves, while in reality they proceed from\nthe throne of God. (See 225.)\n\n298\\. As it is very difficult to gather together the mustard-seeds that escape\nout of a torn package, and are scattered in all directions; so, when the human\nmind runs in diverse directions and is occupied with many things in the world,\nit is not a very easy affair to collect and concentrate it.\n\n299\\. As thieves cannot enter the house the inmates of which are wide awake,\nso, if you are always on your guard, no evil spirits will be able to enter\nyour heart to rob it of its goodness.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Sayings of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a: 300-395](rls28.htm)\n\n"
