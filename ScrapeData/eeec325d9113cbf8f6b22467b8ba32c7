Two (sisters) of different shapes wander along, pursuing a good aim. The\none and the other suckles the calf [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:1:1). With the one\n(the calf) is golden, moving according to its wont\n[2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:1:2). With the other it is seen clear, full of fine\nsplendour.\n\n2\\. The ten unwearied [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:2:1) young women\n[2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:2:2) have brought forth this widely-spread germ of\nTvash _t_ _ri_  [3](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:2:3). Him, the sharp-faced (Agni) who\nis endowed with his own splendour, the shining one, they\n[4](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:2:4) carry around among men.\n\n3\\. They celebrate his three births: one in the sea, one in heaven, one in the\nwaters [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:3:1). In the eastern region\n[2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:3:2) he commanding determines the seasons of the\ndwellers on earth by his present power [3](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:3:3).\n\n4\\. Who among you has understood this hidden (god)?\n[1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:4:1) The calf has by itself given birth to its\nmothers [2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:4:2). The germ of many (mothers), the great\nseer, moving by his own strength, comes forward from the lap of the active\nones [3](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:4:3).\n\n5 [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:5:1). The fair (child Agni) grows up visibly in\nthem in his own glory, standing erect in the lap of the down-streaming\n(waters). Both (Heaven and Earth) fled away in fear of (the son of) Tvash _t_\n_ri_  [2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:5:2), when he was born, but turning back they\ncaress the lion.\n\n6\\. They caress him both, like two kind women; like lowing cows they have\napproached him in their own way. He has become the lord of all\n\np. 115\n\npowers [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:6:1), he whom they anoint with sacrificial\ngifts from the right side [2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:6:2).\n\n7\\. He raises his arms again and again like Savit _ri_\n[1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:7:1). He the terrible pressing on ranges both wings\n[2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:7:2) (of his army). He raises up his bright vesture\nfrom himself alone [3](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:7:3). He gives new garments to his\nmothers.\n\n8\\. He assumes his fierce appearance which is above (i. e. the lightning?),\nbeing united with the cows [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:8:1), the waters in his\nseat. The prayer purifies the bottom of the seer (?)\n[2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:8:2). This was the meeting among the gods\n[3](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:8:3).\n\n9\\. The wide space encompasses thy base, the resplendent foundation\n[1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:9:1) of the buffalo. Agni! Being kindled protect us\nwith all thy undeceivable guardians who are endowed with their own splendour.\n\n10\\. On the dry ground he produces a stream [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:10:1), a\ncourse, a flood. With his bright floods he reaches the earth. Whatever is old\nhe receives into his belly. He moves about within the young sprouting grass\n[2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:10:2).\n\n11\\. Thus, O Agni, being strengthened by fuel, shine thou to us with wealth-\ngiving shine, O purifier, for the sake of glory. May Mitra and Varu _n_ a\ngrant us this, may Aditi, Sindhu, the Earth, and the Sky!\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. The metre is Trish _t_ ubh.--Verse 1 = VS. XXXIII, 5; TB.\nII, 7, 12, 2. Verse 2 = TB. II, 8, 7, 4. Verse 5 = TB. II, 8, 7, 4; MS. IV,\n14, 8.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The two females are evidently Night and Dawn\n\np. 116\n\n[paragraph continues] (comp. below, 96, 5). The calf is Agni whose bright\nappearance by night is contrasted here with his paler splendour by day (comp.\nbelow, 127, 5). The explanation of Professor Hillebrandt (Vedische Mythologie,\nI, 331) that 'das von ihnen wechselnd gesaugte Kalb der bald als Sonne bald\nals Mond erscheinende Lichtgott, d. h. Agni ist,' does not seem convincing to\nme.\n\nNote 2. I cannot follow Hillebrandt (loc. cit. 335) in translating svadha\xc2\xb4van\n'an Labung reich.'\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. On feminine nominatives in -asa _h_ like atandrasa _h_ , see Lanman,\nNoun-Inflection, 362.\n\nNote 2. The ten young women are the fingers which produce the fire by the\nattrition of woods.\n\nNote 3. On Tvash _t_ _ri_ as the father of Agni, see Hillebrandt, Vedische\nMythologie, I, 522 seq.; Bergaigne, Rel. Ved., III, 47 seq.\n\nNote 4. Hillebrandt (loc. cit.) takes the ten fingers as the subject of pari\nnayanti, which does not seem probable.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. It is surprising that Agni's birth in the sea and his birth in the\nwaters are distinguished. The poet's meaning is not quite clear. Prof. Max\nMuller thinks of the rising sun and the lightning in the clouds. Comp. H. O.,\nReligion des Veda, 107.\n\nNote 2. We ought to read pradi _s_ am; comp. IV, 29, 3; IX. IX. 111, 3.\n\nNote 3. Comp. X, 85, 18, where it is said of the moon that she 'is born again,\ndetermining the seasons.' Thus it is possible that the poet understands here\nAgni as dwelling in the moon as light. Comp. on this identification Bergaigne,\nI, 159, and Hillebrandt, Ved. Mythologie, I, 330 seq. But this interpretation\nof our passage is by no means certain.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. Possibly we should correct ka _h_ idam va _h_ ni _n_ yam; comp. VII,\n56, 4; 61, 5. The translation would be: 'Who\n\np. 117\n\namong you has understood this secret?'--the secret that a calf should give\nbirth to cows.\n\nNote 2. In my opinion the mothers are the waters; the calf is Agni. The\nmeaning must be, consequently, that, as Agni is born from the waters thus the\nwaters are born from Agni. Agni--we may try to interpret the poet's meaning--\nsends his smoke to the sky. The smoke is charged to clouds; the clouds send\nforth water. Exactly the same meaning seems to be expressed in I, 164, 51.\nComp. also Manu III, 76. agnau prastahuti _h_ samyag adityam upatish _th_ ate,\naditya _g_ _g_ ayate v _ri_ sh _t_ ir v _ri_ sh _t_ er anna _m_ tata _h_ pra\n_g_ a _h_.--Prof. Max Muller observes: 'The mothers are day and night, or\nheaven and earth. The calf, the son, Agni, being born of the night gives birth\nto the day, and beings born of the day (in the evening) gives birth to the\nnight. Or it may be that Agni, light, makes Dyaus and P _ri_ thivi to be\nvisible.'--Prof. Hillebrandt's interpretation of our verse is quite different;\nsee Vedische Mythologie, I, 33.5.\n\nNote 3. I. e. the fire is born from the waters.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Comp. Hillebrandt, Ved. Myth., I, 371, 523.\n\nNote 2. I. e. the son of Tvash _t_ _ri_ (see above. verse 2) considered as\nidentical with his father. Comp. Bergaigne, III, 47, and see also Aufrecht,\nKuhn's Zeitschrift, I, 356.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. On daksha and its relation to kratu, comp. Geldner, Vedische Studien,\nI, 267.\n\nNote 2. The poet seems to play upon words; 'power' is daksha, 'from the right\nside' dakshi _n_ ata _h_ (i. e. approaching respectfully, dakshi _n_ ik _ri_\ntya).\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. Comp. Bergaigne, Rel. Ved., III, 46.\n\nNote 2. Observe the dual form si _k_ au ending in -au, not in -a. Comp.\nLanman, Noun-Inflection, 576. Prof. Max\n\np. 118\n\n[paragraph continues] Muller translates here: He the terrible tries and\nstretches out the hems of his sleeves.' This may indeed be the meaning of si\n_k_.\n\nNote 3. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, II, 189.\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. The cows of course are intended for the sacrificial food coming from\nthe cow, such as milk and butter.\n\nNote 2. The two nominatives, kavi _h_ and dhi\xc2\xb4 _h_ , can scarcely be right.\nThe subject seems to be the prayer which cleanses, as it were, Agni, and thus\naugments his splendour (comp. IV, 15, 6; VIII, 103, 7). Possibly we should\nread kave _h_ budhnam. Comp., however, IX, 47, 4. svayam kavi _h_ vidhartari\nvipraya ratnam i _k_ _kh_ ati yadi marm _ri_ _g_ yate dhiya _h_. In this\ndifficult verse so much is clear that the seer (kavi _h_ ) is subject, and\nthat he is stated to purify the prayers.\n\nNote 3. The meaning seems to be that at the sacrificial fire all gods\nassemble.\n\n##### Verse 9.\n\nNote 1. On dha\xc2\xb4man, comp. M. M., vol. xxxii, p. 383 seq.--Prof. Max Muller\nproposes the following translation: 'Thy wide effulgence goes round the\nfirmament, the firm seat of the strong one (buffalo).'\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Ludwig takes srota _h_ as a locative. But it is very improbable that\nwe should have here a survival of the ancient locatives of stems in -s without\na case-ending (Joh. Schmidt, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, 306; Brugmann,\nGrundriss der vergl. Grammatik, vol. ii, p. 611). In Ludwig's opinion 'it\nfollows from the corresponding gatum urmim that srotas stands for srotasi as\ndhanvan for dhanvani.' But this is not convincing.\n\nNote 2. On Agni as inhabiting the sprouting grass, comp. III, 5, 8; VII, 9, 3.\n'I believe this refers to the blades of grass used as tinder to catch the\nsparks of fire.' M. M.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 96](sbe46032.htm)\n\n"
