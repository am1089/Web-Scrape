Death said: \'The good is one thing, the pleasant another; these two,\nhaving different objects, chain a man. It is well with him who clings to the\ngood; he who chooses the pleasant, misses his end.\'\n\n2\\. \'The good and the pleasant approach man: the wise goes round about them\nand distinguishes them. Yea, the wise prefers the good to the pleasant, but\nthe fool chooses the pleasant through greed and avarice.\'\n\n3\\. \'Thou, O Na _k_ iketas, after pondering all pleasures that are or seem\ndelightful, hast dismissed them all. Thou hast not gone into the road 1 that\nleadeth to wealth, in which many men perish.\'\n\n4\\. \'Wide apart and leading to different points are these two, ignorance, and\nwhat is known as wisdom. I believe Na _k_ iketas to be one who desires\nknowledge, for even many pleasures did not tear thee away 2.\'\n\n5\\. \'Fools dwelling in darkness, wise in their own conceit, and puffed up with\nvain knowledge, go round and round, staggering to and fro, like blind men led\nby the blind 3.\'\n\n6\\. \'The Hereafter never rises before the eyes of the careless child, deluded\nby the delusion of wealth. "This is the world," he thinks, "there is no\nother;"--thus he falls again and again under my sway.\'\n\n7\\. \'He (the Self) of whom many are not even able\n\np. 9\n\nto hear, whom many, even when they hear of him, do not comprehend; wonderful\nis a man, when found, who is able to teach him (the Self); wonderful is he who\ncomprehends him, when taught by an able teacher 1.\'\n\n8\\. \'That (Self), when taught by an inferior man, is not easy to be known,\neven though often thought upon 2; unless it be taught by another, there is no\nway to it, for it is inconceivably smaller than what is small 3.\'\n\n9\\. \'That doctrine is not to be obtained 4 by argument, but when it is\ndeclared by another, then, O dearest, it is easy to understand. Thou hast\nobtained it now 5; thou art truly a man of true resolve. May we have always an\ninquirer like thee 6!\'\n\n10\\. Na _k_ iketas said: \'I know that what is called a treasure is transient,\nfor that eternal is not obtained by things which are not eternal. Hence the\nNakiketa fire(-sacrifice) has been laid by me (first); then, by means of\ntransient things, I have obtained what is not transient (the teaching of Yama)\n7.\'\n\n11\\. Yama said: \'Though thou hadst seen the fulfilment of all desires, the\nfoundation of the world, the endless rewards of good deeds, the shore where\n\np. 10\n\nthere is no fear, that which is magnified by praise, the wide abode, the rest\n1, yet being wise thou hast with firm resolve dismissed it all.\'\n\n12\\. \'The wise who, by means of meditation on his Self, recognises the\nAncient, who is difficult to be seen, who has entered into the dark, who is\nhidden in the cave, who dwells in the abyss, as God, he indeed leaves joy and\nsorrow far behind 2.\'\n\n13\\. \'A mortal who has heard this and embraced it, who has separated from it\nall qualities, and has thus reached the subtle Being, rejoices, because he has\nobtained what is a cause for rejoicing. The house (of Brahman) is open, I\nbelieve, O Na _k_ iketas.\'\n\n14\\. Na _k_ iketas said: \'That which thou seest as neither this nor that, as\nneither effect nor cause, as neither past nor future, tell me that.\'\n\n15\\. Yama said: \'That word (or place) which all the Vedas record, which all\npenances proclaim, which men desire when they live as religious students, that\nword I tell thee briefly, it is Om 3.\'\n\n16\\. \'That (imperishable) syllable means Brahman, that syllable means the\nhighest (Brahman); he who knows that syllable, whatever he desires, is his.\'\n\n17\\. \'This is the best support, this is the highest support; he who knows that\nsupport is magnified in the world of Brahma.\'\n\n18\\. \'The knowing (Self) is not born, it dies not; it sprang from nothing,\nnothing sprang from it. The\n\np. 11\n\n[paragraph continues] Ancient is unborn, eternal, everlasting; he is not\nkilled, though the body is killed 1.\'\n\n19\\. \'If the killer thinks that he kills, if the killed thinks that he is\nkilled, they do not understand; for this one does not kill, nor is that one\nkilled.\'\n\n20\\. \'The Self 2, smaller than small, greater than great, is hidden in the\nheart of that creature. A man who is free from desires and free from grief,\nsees the majesty of the Self by the grace of the Creator 3.\'\n\n21\\. \'Though sitting still, he walks far; though lying down, he goes\neverywhere 4. Who, save myself, is able to know that God who rejoices and\nrejoices not?\'\n\n22\\. \'The wise who knows the Self as bodiless within the bodies, as unchanging\namong changing things, as great and omnipresent, does never grieve.\'\n\n23\\. \'That Self 5 cannot be gained by the Veda, nor by understanding, nor by\nmuch learning. He whom the Self chooses, by him the Self can be gained. The\nSelf chooses him (his body) as his own.\'\n\n24\\. \'But he who has not first turned away from his wickedness, who is not\ntranquil, and subdued, or whose mind is not at rest, he can never obtain the\nSelf (even) by knowledge!\n\n25\\. \'Who then knows where He is, He to whom the Brahmans and Kshatriyas are\n(as it were) but food 6, and death itself a condiment?\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[8:1](sbe15011.htm#fr_95) Cf. I, 16.\n\n[8:2](sbe15011.htm#fr_96) The commentator explains lolupanta _h_ by vi _k_\n_kh_ eda _m_ k _ri_ tavanta _h_.

Other interpretations:\nIf it is taught by one who is identified with the Self, then there is no\nuncertainty. If it has been taught as identical with ourselves, then there is\nno perception of anything else. If it has been taught by one who is identified\nwith it, then there is no failure in understanding it (agati).\n\n[9:4](sbe15011.htm#fr_101) \xc3\x82paneya; should it be apanaya, as afterwards sug\n_\xc3\xb1_ anaya?\n\n[9:5](sbe15011.htm#fr_102) Because you insist on my teaching it to thee.\n\n[9:6](sbe15011.htm#fr_103) Unless no is negative, for Yama, at first, does not\nlike to communicate his knowledge.\n\n[9:7](sbe15011.htm#fr_104) The words in parentheses have been added in order\nto remove the otherwise contradictory character of the two lines.\n\n[10:1](sbe15011.htm#fr_105) Cf. _Kh_ and. Up. VII, 12, 2.\n\n[10:2](sbe15011.htm#fr_106) Yama seems here to propound the lower Brahman\nonly, not yet the highest. Deva, God, can only be that as what the Old, i.e.\nthe Self in the heart, is to be recognised. It would therefore mean, he who\nfinds God or the Self in his heart. See afterwards, verse 21.\n\n[10:3](sbe15011.htm#fr_107) Cf. _S_ vet. Up. IV, 9; Bhag. Gita VIII, 11.\n\n[11:1](sbe15011.htm#fr_108) As to verses 18 and 19, see Bhag.

X, 12, 1.\n\n[11:3](sbe15011.htm#fr_110) The commentator translates \'through the\ntranquillity of the senses,\' i.e. dhatuprasadat, taking prasada in the\ntechnical sense of samprasada. As to kratu, desire, or rather, will, see B\n_ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. IV, 4; 5.\n\n[11:4](sbe15011.htm#fr_111) Cf. Tal. Up, 5.\n\n[11:5](sbe15011.htm#fr_112) Cf. I, 7-9; Mu _n_ _d_. Up. III, 2, 3; Bhag.
