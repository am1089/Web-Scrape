Yet it is hoped that, by keeping\nour eyes fixed on the spiritual man, remembering that he is the hero of the\nstory, and that all that is written concerns him and his adventures, we may be\nable to find our way through this thicket of tangled words, and keep in our\nhands the clue to the mystery.\n\nThe last part of the last book needs little introduction. In a sense, it is\nthe most important part of the whole treatise, since it unmasks the nature of\nthe personality, that psychical 'mind,' which is the wakeful enemy of all who\nseek to tread the path. Even now, we can hear it whispering the doubt whether\nthat can be a good path, which thus sets 'mind' at defiance.\n\nIf this, then, be the most vital and fundamental part of the teaching, should\nit not stand at the very beginning? It may seem so at first; but had it stood\nthere, we should not have comprehended it. For he who would know the doctrine\nmust lead the life, doing the will of his Father which is in Heaven.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book IV](ysp08.htm)\n\n"
