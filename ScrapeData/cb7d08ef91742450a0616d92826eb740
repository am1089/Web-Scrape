Let him offer ( _S_ raddha oblations) every month to the fathers.\n\n2 2. Having invited an uneven number of Brahma _n_ as, versed in the Veda, at\nleast three, to sit down as (representing) the fathers,\n\np. 107\n\n3\\. And having strewn sesamum into an uneven number of water-pots,\n\n4\\. He shall pour them out over the hands of the Brahma _n_ as, assigning\n(this gift) to them with the words, \'N.N.! This to thee!\'\n\n5 5-7. After this they should be adorned;\n\n6\\. And after he has (respectfully) spoken to them, and has put food into the\nfire,\n\n7\\. Assigning (the food) to them with the words, \'N.N.! This to thee!\' he\nshall cause them to eat.\n\n8\\. While they are eating, he shall murmur the Mahavyah _ri_ tis, the Savitri,\nthe Madhuvatiya-verses (Rig-veda I, 90, 6 seq.), and verses addressed to the\nManes and to (Soma) Pavamana.\n\np. 108\n\n9 9. When they have finished with eating, he shall offer the lumps (of flour).\n\n10 10-11. Before (their dinner he shall offer) the lumps, according to some\n(teachers).\n\n11\\. Behind (these he places the lumps) for their wives, putting something\nbetween (these and the preceding ones).\n\n12\\. To the Brahma _n_ as he shall announce the remnants.\n\n13 13. The rites of the putting (of food) into the fire (see Sutra 6), &c.\nhave been declared (in the _S_ rauta-sutra) by the Pi _n_ _d_ apit _ri_ ya _g_\n_\xc3\xb1_ a.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[106:1](sbe29063.htm#fr_231) 1, 1. Kha _n_ _d_ as 1-4 contain the rules\nregarding the _S_ raddha oblations directed to the Manes. The dinners offered\nin connection with these _S_ raddha sacrifices to Brahma _n_ as and\nalso\xc2\x97though of this of course no notice is taken in Vedic texts\xc2\x97to _S_ rama\n_n_ as stood in the first line among the exhibitions of liberality of lay\npeople towards priests and monks. Thus we find among the stock phrases that\nconstantly reoccur in the Pali Pi _t_ akas, the mention of Sama _n_ as and\nBrahma _n_ as \'who have eaten the food given to them out of faith\'\n(saddhadeyyani bho _g_ anani bhu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ itva)\xc2\x97wherein the \'food given out of\nfaith\' (saddhadeyya) either chiefly or exclusively means the _S_ raddha\ndinners, which are so called because the sacrificer gives them \'full of faith\'\n( _s_ raddhasamanvita, Manu III, 275) to the Brahma _n_ as and through them to\nthe Manes.\n\nThe principal form of _S_ raddha is that treated of in chap. 1, which is\ndesignated in other texts (see, for instance, \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G _ri_ hya IV, 7,\n1) as parva _n_ a _s_ raddha. There are, however, besides the parvan of the\nnew moon, other times also considered as admissible for the performing of this\nmonthly _S_ raddha; see Gautama XV, 2 seq.; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 16, &c.; and comp.\non the _S_ raddhas in general the passages quoted by Professor Jolly, Das\nDharma-sutra des Vish _n_ u (Sitzung der Bair. Akademie, phil. Classe, 7 Juni,\n1879), pp. 46 seq.; Max Muller, \'India, what can it teach us?\' pp. 234 Seq.,\n374 seq.\n\n[106:2](sbe29063.htm#fr_232) \'"As the fathers" means: he invites the youngest,\nmiddle-aged, and eldest Brahma _n_ as to sit down in the place of the father,\nthe grandfather, and the great-grandfather\' (Naraya _n_ a). A similar\nexplanation of pit _ri_ vat is mentioned by Naraya _n_ a on \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana-G\n_ri_ hya p. 107 IV, 7, 2. My German translation of this Sutra ought to be\naltered accordingly.\n\nBesides the Brahma _n_ as mentioned in this Sutra, who represent the fathers,\naccording to all the commentaries, other Brahma _n_ as had to be invited as\nrepresenting the Vi _s_ ve devas. Naraya _n_ a gives detailed statements as to\nthe number of the pait _ri_ ka and of the daivika Brahma _n_ as to be invited,\nand though at first sight a European reader would rather be inclined to doubt\nwhether at the _S_ raddha ceremony, as the author of the text intended to\ndescribe it, any Brahma _n_ as at all had to be present except the pait _ri_\nkas, the Sutra 2, 5 shows that the commentators are quite right in their\nstatements regarding both categories of Brahma _n_ as.\n\n[107:5-7](sbe29063.htm#fr_233) It would be more natural to alter the division\nof the Sutras, so as to bring amantrya in the fifth, anna _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ a in the\nseventh Sutra. In this case we should have to translate: 5. After this, having\n(respectfully) spoken to them who have been adorned (by him with flowers,\nornaments, &c.); 6. And having put (food) into the fire, 7. And having\nassigned the food to them, &c., he shall cause them to eat.\xc2\x97The respectful\naddress mentioned in the fifth Sutra consists, according to Naraya _n_ a, in\nthe announcement, \'Ye Brahma _n_ as, I will put (food) into the fire!\' (comp.\n\xc3\x82 _s_ v.-G _ri_ hya IV, 7, 18), which he subsequently does with the formulas,\n\'To Agni Kavyavahana svaha! To Soma Pit _ri_ mat svaha! To Yama A\xe1\xb9\x85girasvat Pit\n_ri_ mat svaha!\' Comp. Baudhayana II, 1 4, 8.\n\n[108:9](sbe29063.htm#fr_234) As to the way in which the Pi _n_ _d_ as should\nhe offered, Naraya _n_ a refers to the _S_ rauta-sutra (IV, 4).\n\n[108:10-11](sbe29063.htm#fr_235) 10, 11. Pi _n_ _d_ an evidently belongs to\nthe tenth Sutra, not, as the Indian tradition takes it, to the eleventh.\nBetween the Pi _n_ _d_ as of the fathers and those belonging to the mothers he\nputs, according to Naraya _n_ a, for instance, Darbha grass.\n\n[108:13](sbe29063.htm#fr_236) _S_ rauta-sutra IV, 3 seq.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 2](sbe29064.htm)\n\n'
