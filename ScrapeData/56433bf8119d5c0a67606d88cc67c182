Not so; as there are parallel instances.\n\nThere is nothing objectionable in our system.--The objection that the effect\nwhen being reabsorbed into its\n\np. 311\n\ncause would inquinate the latter with its qualities does not damage our\nposition 'because there are parallel instances,' i. e. because there are\ninstances of effects not inquinating with their qualities the causes into\nwhich they are reabsorbed. Things, for instance, made of clay, such as pots,\n&c., which in their state of separate existence are of various descriptions,\ndo not, when they are reabsorbed into their original matter (i.e. clay),\nimpart to the latter their individual qualities; nor do golden ornaments\nimpart their individual qualities to their elementary material, i. e. gold,\ninto which they may finally be reabsorbed. Nor does the fourfold complex of\norganic beings which springs from earth impart its qualities to the latter at\nthe time of reabsorption. You (i. e. the purvapakshin), on the other hand,\nhave not any instances to quote in your favour. For reabsorption could not\ntake place at all if the effect when passing back into its causal substance\ncontinued to subsist there with all its individual properties. And 1 that in\nspite of the non-difference of cause and effect the effect has its Self in the\ncause, but not the cause in the effect, is a point which we shall render clear\nlater on, under II, 1, 14.\n\nMoreover, the objection that the effect would impart its qualities to the\ncause at the time of reabsorption is formulated too narrowly because, the\nidentity of cause and effect being admitted, the same would take place during\nthe time of the subsistence (of the effect, previous to its reabsorption).\nThat the identity of cause and effect (of Brahman and the world) holds good\nindiscriminately with regard to all time (not only the time of reabsorption),\nis declared in many scriptural passages, as, for instance, 'This everything is\nthat Self' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 6); 'The Self is all this' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 25,\n2); 'The immortal Brahman is this before' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); 'All this is\nBrahman' ( _Kh_. Up. III, 14, 1).\n\nWith regard to the case referred to in the _S_ ruti-passages we refute the\nassertion of the cause being affected by the\n\np. 312\n\neffect and its qualities by showing that the latter are the mere fallacious\nsuperimpositions of nescience, and the very same argument holds good with\nreference to reabsorption also.--We can quote other examples in favour of our\ndoctrine. As the magician is not at any time affected by the magical illusion\nproduced by himself, because it is unreal, so the highest Self is not affected\nby the world-illusion. And as one dreaming person is not affected by the\nillusory visions of his dream because they do not accompany the waking state\nand the state of dreamless sleep; so the one permanent witness of the three\nstates (viz. the highest Self which is the one unchanging witness of the\ncreation, subsistence, and reabsorption of the world) is not touched by the\nmutually exclusive three states. For that the highest Self appears in those\nthree states, is a mere illusion, not more substantial than the snake for\nwhich the rope is mistaken in the twilight. With reference to this point\nteachers knowing the true tradition of the Vedanta have made the following\ndeclaration, 'When the individual soul which is held in the bonds of slumber\nby the beginningless Maya awakes, then it knows the eternal, sleepless,\ndreamless non-duality' (Gau _d_ ap. Kar. I, 16).\n\nSo far we have shown that--on our doctrine--there is no danger of the cause\nbeing affected at the time of reabsorption by the qualities of the effect,\nsuch as grossness and the like.--With regard to the second objection, viz.\nthat if we assume all distinctions to pass (at the time of reabsorption) into\nthe state of non-distinction there would be no special reason for the origin\nof a new world affected with distinctions, we likewise refer to the 'existence\nof parallel instances.' For the case is parallel to that of deep sleep and\ntrance. In those states also the soul enters into an essential condition of\nnon-distinction; nevertheless, wrong knowledge being not yet finally overcome,\nthe old state of distinction re-establishes itself as soon as the soul awakes\nfrom its sleep or trance. Compare the scriptural passage, 'All these creatures\nwhen they have become merged in the True, know not that they are merged in the\nTrue. Whatever these creatures are here, whether a lion, or a\n\np. 313\n\nwolf, or a boar, or a worm, or a midge, or a gnat, or a musquito, that they\nbecome again' ( _Kh_. Up. VI, 9, 2; 3) For just as during the subsistence of\nthe world the phenomenon of multifarious distinct existence, based on wrong\nknowledge, proceeds unimpeded like the vision of a dream, although there is\nonly one highest Self devoid of all distinction; so, we conclude, there\nremains, even after reabsorption, the power of distinction (potential\ndistinction) founded on wrong knowledge.--Herewith the objection that--\naccording to our doctrine--even the finally released souls would be born again\nis already disposed of. They will not be born again because in their case\nwrong knowledge has been entirely discarded by perfect knowledge.--The last\nalternative finally (which the purvapakshin had represented as open to the\nVedantin), viz. that even at the time of reabsorption the world should remain\ndistinct from Brahman, precludes itself because it is not admitted by the\nVedantins themselves.--Hence the system founded on the Upanishads is in every\nway unobjectionable.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[311:1](sbe34148.htm#fr_276) Nanu pralayakale karyadharma _s_ _k_ en navatish\n_th_ eran na tarhi kara _n_ adharma api tish _th_ eyus tayor abhedat\ntatrahananyatve#piti. \xc3\x82n.
