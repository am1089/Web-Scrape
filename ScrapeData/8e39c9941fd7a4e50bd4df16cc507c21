The\nreason why he betakes himself to the expiatory bath is this. What vital sap\nthere has been in him (Soma and the sacrificer), that (sap) of his he (the\npriest) has produced (extracted) for the offerings. Now that body (of Soma,\ni.e.\n\np. 379\n\nthe Soma-husks),--there is no sap in it; (yet) it is not to be cast away: they\ntake it down to the water and--water being sap--he puts that sap into it. Thus\nhe unites him with that sap, and thus he produces him from it,--he (Soma),\neven when produced, produces him (the sacrificer) 1: and because they take it\ndown (ava-h _ri_  2) to the water, therefore (the bath is called) avabh _ri_\ntha.\n\n4:4:5:22\\. In the first place he performs the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us offerings,\nfor the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us are the extreme end of the sacrifice. As soon as\nhe has performed the Samish _t_ aya _g_ us, they go together to the _k_ atvala\n(pit) with whatever he (the sacrificer) has about him 3: both the black-deer's\nhorn 4 and the girdle he throws into the pit,--\n\n4:4:5:33\\. With (Va _g_. S. VIII, 23), 'Be thou nor adder nor viper!' Now when\nthey take the Soma-husks down to the water, that forsooth is the wishing of\n'good-speed 5!' to it, and this now is the 'good-speed!' to him (the\nsacrificer); for snakes are like rope, and snakes' haunts are like wells\n(pits), and there is as it were a feud between men and snakes: 'Lest that\nshould spring therefrom,' he thinks, and therefore he says, 'Be thou nor adder\nnor viper!'\n\np. 380\n\n4:4:5:44\\. He then makes (the sacrificer) say (Rig-veda I, 24, 8), 'Broad\nforsooth is the path which king Varu _n_ a hath made for the sun to walk\nalong,'--whereby he means to say, 'even as there is for the sun that broad\npath, free from danger and injury, so may there be for me here a broad path,\nfree from danger and injury.'\n\n4:4:5:55\\. 'For the footless hath he made feet to put down 1,' for, although\nhe (the sun) is footless, yet he is able to walk;--'And the forbidder is he of\nall that woundeth the heart,'--thus he frees him from every guilt and evil of\nthe heart.\n\n4:4:5:66\\. He then says, 'Sing the Saman!' or 'Speak the Saman!' but let him\nrather say 'Sing,' for they do sing the Saman. The reason why he sings the\nSaman is that the evil spirits may not injure that body of his outside the\nsacrifice, for the Saman is a repeller of the evil spirits.\n\n4:4:5:77\\. He (the Prastot _ri_ ) sings a (verse) to Agni, for Agni is a\nrepeller of the evil spirits. He sings in the Ati _kh_ andas; for this, the\nAti _kh_ andas, is all the metres 2: therefore he sings in the Ati _kh_ andas.\n\n4:4:5:88\\. He sings, 'Agni burneth, Agni encountereth with flames,--Ahava _h_!\nAhava _h_  3!' Thus he drives the evil spirits away from here.\n\np. 381\n\n4:4:5:99\\. They walk out (from the sacrificial ground) northwards, along the\nback of the pit and the front side of the \xc3\x82gnidhra: then they proceed in\nwhatever direction the water is.\n\n4:4:5:1010\\. Where there is a standing pool of flowing water, there let him\n(the sacrificer) descend into the water--for whatsoever parts of flowing water\nflow not, these are holden by Varu _n_ a; and the expiatory bath belongs to\nVaru _n_ a--to free himself from Varu _n_ a. But if he does not find such, he\nmay descend into any water.\n\n4:4:5:1111\\. While he makes him descend into the water, he bids him say,\n'Homage be to Varu _n_ a: downtrodden is Varu _n_ a's snare!' thus he delivers\nhim from every snare of Varu _n_ a, from every (infliction 1) of Varu _n_ a.\n\n4:4:5:1212\\. Thereupon, taking ghee in four ladlings, and throwing down a\nkindling-stick (on the water), he offers thereon, with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 24),\n'The face of Agni, the waters, have I entered, escaping from the power of\ndemons, O son of the waters! In every homestead offer thou the log, O Agni!\nlet thy tongue dart forth towards the ghee,--Hail!'\n\n4:4:5:1313\\. Now, once on a time, the gods made so much of Agni, as would go\nin 2, enter the water, in order that the evil spirits should not rise\ntherefrom; for Agni is the repeller of evil spirits. It is him he kindles by\nthis kindling-stick and by this\n\np. 382\n\noblation, thinking 'On the kindled (fire) will I offer to the gods!'\n\n4:4:5:1414\\. Then, having taken ghee a second time in four ladlings, and\nhaving called for the (\xc3\x82gnidhra's) _S_ rausha _t_ , he says, 'Pronounce the\noffering prayer to the Kindling-sticks!' He offers four fore-offerings,\nomitting that to the Barhis 1\\--the Barhis being offspring, and the expiatory\nbath belonging to Varu _n_ a--lest Varu _n_ a should seize upon his offspring.\nThis is why he offers four fore-offerings, omitting that to the Barhis.\n\n4:4:5:1515\\. Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Varu _n_ a. For whatever\nsap there had been in him (Soma), that sap of his he has produced (extracted)\nfor the offerings. Now that body: there is no sap in it. But the cake is sap:\nthat sap he puts into it. Thus he unites him with that sap, and so produces\nhim from it,--he (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the sacrificer):\nhence there is a cake on -one potsherd for Varu _n_ a.\n\n4:4:5:1616\\. Having made an 'underlayer' of ghee (in the offering-spoon), he\nsays, while making the cuttings from the cake 2, 'Recite (the invitatory\nprayer) to Varu _n_ a!' Here now some make two cuttings from the Soma-husks,\nbut let him not do so; for that (heap of husks) is an empty body, unfit for\noffering. He makes two cuttings (from the cake) and bastes them once with\nghee, and anoints (replenishes the places whence) the cuttings (have been\nmade). Having called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says, 'Recite the\n\np. 383\n\noffering prayer to Varu _n_ a!' and offers as the Vasha _t_ is uttered.\n\n4:4:5:1717\\. Then, having made an underlayer of ghee, he says, while putting\nthe (remainder of the) cake (into the spoon), 'Recite the invitatory prayer to\nAgni and Varu _n_ a!' This is for (Agni) Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t 1; and as to why\nhe does not say 'To Agni,' it is lest Varu _n_ a might seize upon Agni. If\nbefore he has cut twice from the Soma-husks, he now does so once, but if (he\ndid) not, he need not heed it. He then bastes it twice with butter on the\nupper side; and having called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says, 'Recite the\noffering prayer to Agni and Varu _n_ a!' and offers as the Vasha _t_ is\nuttered.\n\n4:4:5:1818\\. Now these are six oblations; for there are six seasons in the\nyear, and Varu _n_ a is the year: hence there are six oblations.\n\n4:4:5:1919\\. This is the course of the \xc3\x82dityas 2; and these Ya _g_ us, they\nsay, belong to the \xc3\x82dityas. Let (the Adhvaryu) endeavour to perform as much of\nit as is his (the sacrificer's) wish. And if the sacrificer tell him to do\notherwise, then he should do otherwise. He may also perform those same four\nfore-offerings,--omitting that to the Barhis--two butter-portions, (the\noblations of cake) to Varu _n_ a and Agni-Varu _n_ a, and two after-offerings,\n--omitting the one to the Barhis;--this makes ten. Now the vira _g_ consists\n\np. 384\n\nof ten syllables, and the sacrifice is vira _g_ : thus he makes the sacrifice\nto be like the vira _g_.\n\n4:4:5:2020\\. This is the course of the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras. Having performed the offerings\neither way, (the Adhvaryu) makes the pot, in which the husks are, float with\n(Va _g_. S. VIII, 25), 'In the ocean, in the waters, is thy heart (O Soma)'--\nfor the ocean is the waters, and water is sap: that sap he now puts into him\n(Soma), and thus he unites him with that sap, and produces him therefrom; and\nhe (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the sacrificer);--'May the plants\nand the waters unite with thee!'--thereby he puts two kinds of sap into him,\nthat which is in plants, and that which is in water,--'that we may serve thee,\nO lord of the sacrifice, in the singing of praises and the utterance of\nworship 1, with Svaha!' Whatever is good in the sacrifice, that he thereby\nputs into him.\n\n4:4:5:2121\\. Thereupon, letting it go, he stands by it with (Va _g_. S. VIII,\n26), 'Ye divine waters, this is your child,'--for he (Soma) indeed is the\nchild of the waters,--'bear ye him, well-beloved, well-nourished!' he thereby\nmakes him over to the waters for protection--'This, O divine Soma, is thine\nabode: thrive thou well therein, and thrive thou 2 thoroughly!' whereby he\nmeans to say, 'Be thou therein for our happiness, and shield us from all\ninflictions!'\n\np. 385\n\n4:4:5:2222\\. He then immerses it with (Va _g_. S. VIII, 27), 'O laving bath,\nlaving thou glidest along: with the help of the gods may I wipe out the sin\ncommitted against the gods; and with the help of the mortals that committed\nagainst mortals!'--for the sin committed against the gods he has indeed wiped\nout with the help of the gods, namely, with the help of king Soma; and the sin\ncommitted against mortals he has wiped out with the help of mortals, namely,\nby means of the animal victim and the sacrificial cake--'Preserve me, O god,\nfrom injury from the fiercely-howling (demon)!' whereby he means to say,\n'Preserve me from all inflictions!'\n\n4:4:5:2323\\. Thereupon both (the sacrificer and his wife) having descended,\nbathe, and wash each other's back. Having wrapped themselves in fresh garments\n1 they step out: even as a snake casts its skin, so does he cast away all his\nsin,--there is not in him even as much sin as there is in a toothless child.\nBy the same way by which they came out (from the sacrificial ground), they\nreturn thither 2; and, having returned, he puts a kindling-stick on the\n\xc3\x82havaniya (at the front hall-door) with, 'Thou art the kindler of the gods!'\nHe thereby kindles the sacrificer himself,\n\np. 386\n\nfor along with the kindling of the gods the sacrificer is kindled 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[379:1](sbe2659.htm#fr_881) ? That is, as the Soma plants become juicy again,\nso the sacrificer has his vital sap or spirit restored.\n\n[379:2](sbe2659.htm#fr_882) Or, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary,\n'they throw it into the water.'\n\n[379:3](sbe2659.htm#fr_883) Or, whatever is connected with Soma (?). According\nto Katy. X, 8, 12, 19 the throne (asandi) and Audumbari, as well as the Soma\nvessels, Dro _n_ akala _s_ a, &c., are to be carried in the first place to the\n_k_ atvala, and from there to the water.\n\n[379:4](sbe2659.htm#fr_884) See [III, 2, 1, 18](sbe2607.htm#3:2:1:18).

Perhaps, however, 'apade' had better be\ntaken, with Mahidhara (and Saya _n_ a?), in the sense of 'padarahite,' i.e.\n'in the trackless (ether) he caused him (the sun) to plant his feet.'\nSimilarly Ludwig, 'Im Ortlosen hat er sie die Fusse niedersetzen lassen.'\n\n[380:2](sbe2659.htm#fr_887) 'Esha vai sarvam ati yad ati _kh_ anda _h_ ,' Ka\n_n_ va text.

X, 8, 16, 17 the Saman is chanted thrice, viz. in starting\nfrom the _k_ atvala, midway, and at the water-side.\n\n[381:1](sbe2659.htm#fr_889) Or guilt against Varu _n_ a.

X, p. 393, refers us\nto XIV, 9, 4, 33, where it is stated that the Va _g_ asaneyin Adhvaryu has to\nstudy the Ya _g_ us of the \xc3\x82ditya _Ri_ shi. One might also be inclined to\nthink that, by 'Adityanam ayanam' and 'A\xe1\xb9\x85girasam ayanam' the author intended\nto connect the Agnish _t_ oma with the sacrificial sessions designated by\nthose terms, for which see \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r.

I have referred it to 'vaksh.' The Ka _n_ va\ntext reads, Pari _k_ a vakshi _s_ a _m_ _k_ a vakshiti pari _k_ a no gopaya\n_s_ a _m_ _k_ a na edhity evaitad aha.\n\n[385:1](sbe2659.htm#fr_897) According to the Manava Sutra, as quoted on Katy.\nX, 9, 6, the sacrificer wraps himself in the cloth in which the Soma stalks\nwere tied (somopanahana), and his wife in the outer cloth tied round the Soma\nbundle (parya _n_ ahana). The Soma vessels and implements are likewise thrown\ninto the water.\n\n[385:2](sbe2659.htm#fr_898) While going thither they all mutter the \xc3\x82mahiya\nverse, Rig-veda VIII, 48, 3, 'We have drunk Soma, we have become immortal, we\nhave gone to the light, we have attained to the gods: what now can the enemy\ndo unto us, what the guile, O immortal, of the mortal?'\n\n[386:1](sbe2659.htm#fr_899) The sacrificer sits down behind the _s_ aladvarya\nfire and spreads the black deer-skin over his knees; the Adhvaryu then making\nan oblation of ghee from the dipping-spoon.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 5, 1.
