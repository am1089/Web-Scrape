The manuscripts were\nbegun in 1901, and were ready for the Press by the end of 1903, but through\nunavoidable circumstances the publication was delayed. It was only after the\npassing away of Swami Swarupananda that the work was brought out in monthly\ninstalments in the _Prabuddha Bharata_ , and this work is now presented to the\npublic in convenient book form, after being carefully edited and enlarged with\nadditional comments.\n\nThe object of the compiler was to make accessible to the Indian public who are\neducated in English but have a limited knowledge in Sanskrit, and also to the\nWestern world, an edition of the Celestial Gita, in which they will feel\nsufficient interest to follow the original text, and thus create a taste for\nthe study and interpretation of holy Sanskrit literature. How far the compiler\nhas been successful in his object can be gleaned from the following pages. His\nthoughtful comments following the commentaries of the great Acharyas, and\nilluminating\n\n* * *\n\nsidelights thrown on intricate places, will, we trust, be of much help to the\nstudy of the Gita, especially to a beginner. An elaborate Index has been\nsubsequently added.\n\nA word of explanation as to the paraphrase is necessary here: Though the\nliteral meaning of each word is given, yet to avoid the awkwardness of\nlanguage and confusion of sense to a beginner, the equivalents of case\nterminals of such words as are used to qualify some other words in the\nsentence, are omitted in most cases.\n\nWe hope this edition will meet a much-felt want, not only in India but in all\nEnglish-speaking countries.\n\nThe Editors and Publishers\n\nADVAITA ASHRAMA  \nMAYAVATI, HIMALAYAS  \n_18th October, 1909_\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Contents](sbg02.htm)\n\n'
