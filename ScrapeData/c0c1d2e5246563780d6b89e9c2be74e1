There is distribution (of the work and knowledge) as in the case of the\nhundred.\n\nIn reply to the averment (Sutra 5) that the passage, 'Then both his knowledge\nand his work take hold of him,' indicates the non-independence of knowledge,\nwe point out that the passage must be understood in a distributed sense,\nknowledge taking hold of one man and work of another. The case is analogous to\nthat of the 'hundred.' When it is said, 'Let a hundred be given to these two\nmen,' the hundred are divided in that way that fifty are given to one man and\nfifty to the other.--Moreover what the text says about the laying hold does\nnot refer to him who is about to obtain final release; for the concluding\npassage, 'So much for the man who desires,' indicates that the whole section\nrefers to the soul implicated in the sa _m_ sara, and a new beginning is made\nfor him who is about to be released, in the clause. 'But as to the man who\ndoes not\n\np. 293\n\ndesire.' The clause about the laying hold thus comprises all knowledge which\nfalls within the sphere of the transmigrating soul whether it be enjoined or\nprohibited 1, since there is no reason for distinction, and to all action\nwhether enjoined or prohibited, the clause embodying a reference to knowledge\nand work as established elsewhere. And on this interpretation there is room\nfor the clause even without our having recourse to the distribution of\nknowledge and work.\n\nThe next Sutra replies to the averment made in Sutra 6.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[293:1](sbe38220.htm#fr_189) Pratishiddha _k_ a nagnastridar _s_ anadirupa.\n\xc3\x82n.
