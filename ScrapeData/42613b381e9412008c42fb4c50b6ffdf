This built fire-altar, in truth, (includes) all these\nsacrifices:--when he slaughters an animal victim, that is the Agnyadheya\n(establishment of the sacred fires) 1; when he collects (the materials for)\nthe fire-pan, that constitutes the oblations of the Agnyadheya; when he\nperforms the initiation,\n\np. 297\n\nthat is the Agnihotra; and when the initiated puts two logs on (the fire) 1,\nthese are the two oblations of the Agnihotra.\n\n10:1:5:22\\. He puts them on in the evening and in the morning, for in the\nevening and in the morning the Agnihotra oblations are offered;--with one and\nthe same formula, for with one and the same formula the two Agnihotra\noblations are offered 2. Then the driving about (of the fire in the pan 3),\nand the taking down (to the water) of the ashes, these two (constitute) the\nNew and Full-moon offerings; and when he builds the Garhapatya hearth 4, that\nis the _K_ aturmasya (seasonal offerings); and what takes place from (the\nbuilding of) the Garhapatya up to the (sowing of) all-herb (seed 5, that\nconstitutes) the ish _t_ is 6, and what takes place after the all-herb\n(sowing) and prior to (the building\n\np. 298\n\nof) the layers, that is the animal sacrifices 1; and the Vish _n_ u-strides 2\nwhich are (performed) at these sacrifices are just these Vish _n_ u-strides;\nand what muttering of formulas there is that is the Vatsapra 3.\n\n10:1:5:33\\. The first layer is the Soma-sacrifice; the second the Ra _g_ asuya\nas prior to the consecrations 4; the third the Va _g_ apeya; the fourth the A\n_s_ vamedha (horse-sacrifice); and the fifth the Agnisava 5. Then the samans\nhe sings around the built (altar) are the Mahavrata(-saman); the Udgat _ri_ 's\npreliminary muttering (of the text of his chants) on that occasion is the _S_\natarudriya; the 'shower of wealth' the Great Litany; and what takes place\nsubsequent to (the singing of) the samans, and prior to the shower of wealth,\nthat is the Hot _ri_ 's preliminary muttering on that occasion; and what takes\nplace after the shower of wealth is the G _ri_ hamedhas 6 (house-sacrifices).\nSuch are all the sacrifices: these he secures by (building) the fire-altar.\n\np. 299\n\n10:1:5:44\\. Now, then, as to the powers (conferred by the performance) of\nsacrifices. Verily, he who (regularly) performs the Agnihotra eats food in the\nevening and in the morning (when he comes to be) in yonder world, for so much\nsustenance is there in that sacrifice. And he who performs the New and Full-\nmoon sacrifice (eats food) every half-month; and he who performs the Seasonal\nsacrifice (does so) every four months; and be who performs the animal\nsacrifice (twice a year, eats food) every six months; and the Soma-sacrificer\nonce a year; and the builder of the fire-altar at his pleasure eats food every\nhundred years, or abstains therefrom 1; for a hundred years is as much as\nimmortality 2, unending and everlasting: and, verily, for him who knows this,\nthere shall thus be immortality, unending and everlasting; and whatever he as\nmuch as touches, as it were, with a reed, shall be for him immortal, unending\nand everlasting.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[296:1](sbe4349.htm#fr_554) Though no animal sacrifice takes place at the\nAgnyadhana, the latter, as the fundamental ceremony pre-supposed by all\nsubsequent sacrificial performances, is here compared with the immolation of\nfive victims (VI, 2, 1, 15 seq.) which, taking place as it does on the\nUpasavatha, or day of preparation, i.e. the day before the Soma-sacrifice on\nthe newly built fire-altar, is, as it were, a preliminary ceremony.\n\n[297:1](sbe4349.htm#fr_555) This refers to the two samidhs (kindling-sticks)\nput on the Ukhya Agni,--one in the evening, and one in the morning,--after the\nashes had been cleared out of the fire-pan (ukha); see VI, 6, 4, 1 seq.\n\n[297:2](sbe4349.htm#fr_556) Both in the evening and in the morning two\nlibations of milk are offered (the purvahuti and the uttarahuti), but only the\nfirst is offered with a formula, the evening formula being, 'Agni is the\nlight, the light is Agni, hail!' whilst the morning formula is, 'Surya is the\nlight, the light is Surya, hail!' See II, 3, 1, 30. For alternative\nformulas--'With the divine Savit _ri_ , with the Night (or Dawn, respectively)\nwedded to Indra, may Agni (or Indra, respectively) graciously accept, hail!'\nsee II, 3, 1, 37. 38.\n\n[297:3](sbe4349.htm#fr_557) See VI, 8, 1, 1 seq. Saya _n_ a takes it to refer\nto the Agnipra _n_ ayana, or leading forward of the fire to the fire-altar;\nbut that would not fit in well with the ceremony next referred to, viz. the\nremoval of the fishes of the Ukhyagni, or fire in the pan; for which see VI,\n8, 2, 1 seq.\n\n[297:4](sbe4349.htm#fr_558) VII, 1, 1, 1 seq.\n\n[297:5](sbe4349.htm#fr_559) Viz. on the newly ploughed altar-site, see VII, 2,\n4, 13 seq.\n\n[297:6](sbe4349.htm#fr_560) That is, offerings for the fulfilment of some\nspecial wishes.\n\n[298:1](sbe4349.htm#fr_561) That is, animal sacrifices performed independently\nof other ceremonies.\n\n[298:2](sbe4349.htm#fr_562) See VI, 7, 2, 12 seq.\n\n[298:3](sbe4349.htm#fr_563) See VI, 7, 4, 1 seq.\n\n[298:4](sbe4349.htm#fr_564) That is, the ceremonies connected with the Va _g_\naprasaviya oblations, V, 2, 2, 4 seq.; and the devasu-havi _m_ shi, or\noblations to the Divine Quickeners (by whom the king is supposed to be first\nconsecrated), V, 3, 3, 1 seq.\n\n[298:5](sbe4349.htm#fr_565) See [IX, 3, 4, 7. 9](sbe4338.htm#9:3:4:9). It is\nstrange that the Agnisava should be mentioned here, as it is said to be\nconfined to the Agni _k_ ayana. It would seem that some independent ceremony,\nsuch as the B _ri_ haspatisava (consecration of B _ri_ haspati, cf. V, 2, 1,\n19; and part iii, introd. p. xxiv seq.), may he referred to.\n\n[298:6](sbe4349.htm#fr_566) Saya _n_ a identifies these with the offerings of\nsacrificial sessions (sattra), during which the Sacrificer is indeed called\nthe G _ri_ hapati, or master of the house; see IV, 6, 3, 5 seq.; and part ii,\np. 97, note 1.\n\n[299:1](sbe4349.htm#fr_567) That is to say, the food eaten the first time will\nsustain him for a hundred years, after which time he may, or may not, take\nfood, being sure of everlasting life and a godlike nature.\n\n[299:2](sbe4349.htm#fr_568) Or, perhaps, for so long lasts the Amrita (the\nfood of the immortals);--agni _m_ _k_ itavan purushas tu _s_ atasa _m_\nkhyakeshu sa _m_ vatsareshu teshu kamam aparimitam a _s_ nati yato yavanta _h_\n_s_ ata _m_ sa _m_ vatsaras tavad am _ri_ tam devatvaprapakam anantam\naparimitam annum bhavati.
