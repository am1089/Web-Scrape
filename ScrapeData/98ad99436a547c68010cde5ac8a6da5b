Vyasa said :-- O king! First there appeared on the mountain, the king of\nthe seasons, Vasanta, the Spring. All the trees flowered and became very\nbeautiful; and the bees began to hum round all sides.\n\n\n\n2\\. Mangoes, Bokul trees, the beautiful Tilaka trees, the good Kimsukas, Sal,\nTal, Tamal and Madhuka trees assumed unequalled beauties, ornamented with\ntheir flowers.\n\n\n\n3\\. Cuckoos began to coo coo (warble) beautifully on the tops of trees; the\ncreepers flowered and began to embrace the trees.\n\n\n\n4\\. The creatures became enamoured with love and began to look on their\nparamours with amorous eyes and began to hold pleasant sexual intercourses.\n\n\n\np. 269\n\n\n\n5\\. The southern breeze blew gently, full of pleasant odours and agreeable to\ntouch. The sensual organs became very powerful and could no longer be brought\nunder their control by the Munis.\n\n\n\n6\\. Then Kama, united with Rati, hurriedly entered into the Hermitage of\nBadarika with the five arrows in his hands.\n\n\n\n7\\. Rambha, Tilottama, and other prominent Apsaras all went to that beautiful\nhermitage and began to sing in perfect tune with gamuts, key notes and\nrespective pauses.\n\n\n\n8\\. The two Mahar _s_ is awoke on hearing the sweet music, the warbling of the\ncuckoos and the nice hummings of the bees.\n\n\n\n9\\. Nara Naraya _n_ a became anxious to see the untimely bursting of the\nVasanta (vernal season) and the flowering of the trees.\n\n\n\n10\\. How can the spring season come now at such an untimely season. I see, all\nthe creatures are become extremely amorous with each other and infatuated with\npassionate lust.\n\n\n\n11\\. It is very unusual that untimely things should happen. How has this come\nto pass? Struck with wonder, Naraya _n_ a began to speak to Nara with eyes\nwide apart.\n\n\n\n12\\. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Brother! See these trees look very elegant with\nflowers on them; the cuckoos are sounding sweet notes on all sides; the bees\nare humming on all sides.\n\n\n\n13\\. The spring, the lion of the seasons, has burst asunder the fierce\nelephant, the winter season, by its sharp nails, as testified by the budding\nof Palasa flowers.\n\n\n\n14-18. O Brahman! See how beautiful and excellent has become this hermitage\nwith the presence of the Goddess Spring Lak _s_ mi? O Devarsi! The Raktas'oka\nflower is the palm of her hand; Kims\xc2\x92uka flower, her excellent feet; Nilasoka\nflowers, her black hairs on her head, the full-blown lotuses, her eyes; the\nbel fruits, her breast; the jolly Kunda flowers, her teeth; Manjari, her\nbeautiful ears; red Bandhu flowers, her lips; Sindhubara, her wonderful nails;\nthe peacocks, her ornaments; the sounds of Sarasa birds, the jingling of her\nfeet ornaments; the wreaths of flowers, her waist ornaments; the mad gooses,\nher gait; Kadamba flower's filaments, her hairs on her body; O best of\nascetics! With all these, the Vasanta Lak _s_ mi has assumed a wonderful nice\nappearance.\n\n\n\n19\\. Why has this occurred untimely? Think over it; O Devar _s_ i! I am struck\nwith wonder; surely this is obstructive of our penances.\n\n\n\np. 270\n\n\n\n20\\. Hear! There the Apsaras are singing sweetly the song, tending to destroy\nour Tapasyas; it seems, these are the means, no doubt, adopted by Indra to\npollute our Tapasya.\n\n\n\n21\\. Why is this spring season now generating our pleasures? It is clear that\nthat Indra, the enemy of the Asuras, is become afraid of our Tapasya and is\ncreating these obstructions to disturb our asceticisms.\n\n\n\n22\\. Lo! The cool, odorous, and pleasant breezes are blowing; no other cause\ncan be traced than the wicked deed of Indra.\n\n\n\n23\\. When the best of the Brahmi _n_ s, the Deva Naraya _n_ a was addressing\nthus, the whole host of Cupid became visible before their sight.\n\n\n\n24\\. And the two Ri _s_ is were very much surprised on seeing them.\n\n\n\n25-27. They saw near to them the Cupid with his attendants Menaka, Rambha,\nTilottama, Puspagandha, Sukes'i, Mahas'veta, Manorama, Pramodvara, Ghritachi,\nCharuhasini, the expert in music, Chandra Prabha, the cuckoo voiced Soma, the\nlotus eyed Vidyunmala, Kanchana malini, and others.\n\n\n\n28\\. Eight thousand and five hundred Apsaras and long multitudes of the hosts\nof Cupid, the Munis saw and were surprised.\n\n\n\n29\\. Then those prostitutes of the Devas, dressed with their heavenly\nornaments and the heavenly flowers, appeared before the Munis and bowed down\ntheir heads on the ground.\n\n\n\n30\\. The Apsaras began their enchanting songs, exciting much passion and\nrarely heard or seen in this world.\n\n\n\n31-32. The two Munis Bhagavan Vi _sn_ u-like Nara Naraya _n_ a were pleased\nwith their music and addressed them thus :-- O thin waisted good looking\nApsaras! You have come here as guests, I see, from your Heavenly world. Stay\nhere in peace and all comfort; we will gladly serve you as your hosts.\n\n\n\n33-34. Vyasa said :-- O king! The two Munis, thinking that Indra has sent\nthese Apsaras to obstruct their Tapasya, were filled with egoism and\ndetermined to create, out of their strength of Tapasya a new Apsara, who would\nbe very much more beautiful and possessing far more heavenly graces than the\npresent ones, who are ordinary looking and clumsy in their behaviours.\n\n\n\n35\\. And the Munis, by clapping or striking their thighs, instantly created a\nwoman, exquisitely beautiful in all respects.\n\n\n\n36\\. This good looking woman was named Urvas'i, since she was produced from\nthe thighs. And all the other Apsaras present there were very much\nthunderstruck on seeing that Urvas'i.\n\n\n\np. 271\n\n\n\n37\\. Then the Muni Naraya _n_ a easily created as many women as there were\nApsaras to serve them.\n\n\n\n38\\. The just produced Apsaras brought with them all sorts of offering in\ntheir hands, and, singing and smiling, came before the Munis and with clasped\nhands bowed down before them.\n\n\n\n39\\. The heavenly damsels sent by Indra, though enchanting to others were\nthemselves now bewildered on beholding Urvas'i, beautiful in all respects and\nproduced out of the Tapasya of the Munis; and their hairs over the bodies\nstood on their ends. Then they tried to make their faces as beautiful as they\ncould and began to address the Munis thus :--\n\n\n\n40\\. O Munis! We are ignorant girls; how can we praise you and the greatness\nof your Tapasya and at your steadiness. Oh! There is no one in this Universe,\nthat is not burnt with the passion by the arrows of our sharp eyesight? But\nthere is no trace of mental disturbance and defilement in you; Oh! Wonderful\nis your greatness, indeed!\n\n\n\n41\\. We are convinced that both of you are the Amsas of Vi _sn_ u and that\nyour treasures are your incessant peace and control of mind. We have come here\nnot to serve you but to hinder you in your penances, that we may fulfill the\ndesires of Indra.\n\n\n\n42\\. By what good luck of ours we have got a sight of thee, we do not know; we\ndo not know also what merits we did? We have committed great offence to you;\nstill you have not cursed us. You have considered us as those of your own\nfamily and have pardoned us. Therefore our minds are free from sorrow and\nanxiety. Much praise be to your forgiveness! Wise saints do not squander away\ntheir occult powers, derived from austerities, in trivial ways like cursing\nothers.\n\n\n\n43\\. Vyasa said :-- Very pleased were those two Dharma's sons, the two Mahar\n_s_ is, self controlled and desireless, to hear these words of those godly\nbehaved heavenly damsels; they then spoke to the damsels, blazing with the\nfire of their Tapas.\n\n\n\n44-45. Nara and Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Damsels! We are pleased with you;\nbetter ask from us your desired boons; we will instantly grant them to you.\nYou better take with you to your Heaven this beautiful eyed Urvas'i, born of\nour thighs as a present to your Deva Raja, the Indra.\n\n\n\n46\\. Now peace be to all the Devas; you better go to your own places; do not,\nin future, disturb the Tapasya of others.\n\n\n\n47\\. The damsels said :-- Where will we go now? We have reached your lotus\nfeet through our devotion, and our joy knows no bounds; O Naraya _n_ a the\nSupreme amongst the Gods!\n\n\n\np. 272\n\n\n\n48\\. O Lord! O Madhusudana! O Lotus-eyed! If Thou art pleased with us and dost\nwant to give us our desired boons, we disclose to you our wished for object.\n\n\n\n49\\. O Lord of the Devas! Thou art the Lord of the world; so beest Thou the\nLord of us. O Destroyer of the foes! We will gladly put ourselves at the\nservice of your feet.\n\n\n\n50\\. Let those sixteen hundred and fifty beautiful-eyed damsels including\nUrvas'i, that are your creation and that are now existing here, let them go\nunto Heaven by your command.\n\n\n\n51\\. And we, the sixteen hundred and fifty damsels that have come before, may\nbe allowed to remain here at your service.\n\n\n\n52\\. O Madhava! You are the Lord of the Devas; be true to your word and give\nus our desires. Those seers, the Munis, who know what is Dharma, declare that\nit is sin, equivalent to murder, to destroy the hopes of those women that are\nstruck with passion.\n\n\n\n53\\. We are very fortunate to come here from Heaven and we are filled with\nextreme love for you, O Deves'a! You are the Lord of the world; you can do all\nthings; therefore do not leave us.\n\n\n\n54\\. Naraya _n_ a said :-- O thin bodied damsels! I am practising at this\nplace the tapasya for full one thousand years, controlling my passions; how\ncan I now break it by engaging myself to enjoy sensual things.\n\n\n\n55\\. I have no inclination to indulge in sexual pleasures, tending to destroy\nthe Highest Bliss as well as the Highest Dharma. What intelligent person will\nlike to indulge like a beast in sensual pleasures.\n\n\n\n56-57. The Apsaras said :-- Of the five senses; sound, etc., the pleasures\nattained through the sensation of touch are excellent, and are reckoned as the\nsource of Bliss; no other pleasures stand equal to it. Therefore do then\nfulfill our words, and enjoy incessantly this highest bliss and roam freely in\nthis Gandhamadan mountain.\n\n\n\n58\\. If you like to go to Heaven, be pleased to know that there is no Superior\nHeaven to Gandhamadan (the mountain like intoxicating happiness of the\nsenses). Dost thou enjoy the highest bliss, the pleasant sexual intercourse\nwith us, the heavenly damsels in this very beautiful and lovely place.\n\n\n\nThus ends the Sixth Chapter in the Fourth Book of S'rimad Devi Bhagavatam, the\nMaha Pura _n_ am of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa on the origin of\nUrvas'i.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 7](bk04ch07.htm)\n\n"
