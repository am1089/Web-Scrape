Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Narada! When persons, impelled by sinful\nmotives, always speak false at the time of giving evidence or at the time of\ntaking or giving money, they, after their death, go to the terrible hell,\nnamed Avichi. There, from the summit of a mountain, one hundred\n\n\n\np. 791\n\n\n\nYojanas high they are dropped at once down below with their heads inverted\ndown. Here the solid ground looks like water and appears like waves. Therefore\nit is called Avichi, resembling like Avichi waves. Here if the sinner\xc2\x92s body\nbe cut to small pieces, still he does not die; rather he gets a new body when\nhis body is all cut to pieces. O Son of Brahma! When a man, be he a Brahmi _n_\n, K _s_ attriya, or a Vais\xc2\x92ya, drinks the Soma (wine) or due to inadvertence\ndrinks wine, he is thrown into this hell. O Muni! The Yama\xc2\x92s servants make him\ndrink the molten iron. When a vile person being maddened by the pride of his\nself-learning, birth, austerities or Varna and \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama, does not pay his\nrespect duly to his superiors, he is thrown into the K _s_ arakardama hell\nwith his head downwards. He suffers a tremendous pain there. When a man or\nwoman out of delusion, performs the human sacrifices (where men are immolated\nas victims), he or she has to eat the human flesh here. Those that killed\nbefore all sorts of beasts, come after their death into this abode of Yama,\nall united and like butchers, cut each other\xc2\x92s flesh by pickaxes, etc., and\ndrink their blood and dance and sing repeatedly. They do, in fact, what the\nterrible Rak _s_ asas do. When persons meet with the innocent persons, wishing\nto live in villages or forests and raise their confidence by various such\nmeans and make them attached and finally pierce them by pointed S\xc2\x92ulas\n(trident) or pointed swords and kill them as if they were ordinary play\nthings, they are taken after their death by the Yama dutas and thrown into\nS\xc2\x92uladi Naraka (pierced by S\xc2\x92ulas). They are pierced there by S\xc2\x92ulas and\nbecome overpowered by hunger and thirst. Herons and cranes, with their sharp\nbeaks hunt after them to and fro. Thus tormented, they remember all their sins\ndone in their previous lives. Those who follow stray paths and trouble the\nother beings as the serpents do, they fall into the Dandas\xc2\x92uka hell. Here\nworms with five faces and seven faces come from all sides and eat them as a\nfierce serpent devours a mouse. Those who confine persons in dark holes, a\ndark room or a dark cave they are taken by the Death servants with their arms\nuplifted and confined to similar dark caves, filled with poison, fire and\nsmoke. When a Brahmi _n_ householder, seeing a guest coming to his house in a\nreasonable (proper) time, casts a furious sinful glance at him as if to burn\nhim, the Death\xc2\x92s attendants, the herons with thunderbolt like beaks, the crows\nand the Va _t_ as and other birds and very fierce vultures all come and\nforcibly take out the eyes of that person who committed the aforesaid sins.\nWhen person elated with vanity of his riches become too haughty and doubt over\ntheir Gurus and when their hearts and faces wither withal away, as it were,\nwith the thoughts of their income and expenditure, and being always unhappy,\nhoard up money always like the Brahma Pis\xc2\x92achas, the\n\n\n\np. 792\n\n\n\nDeath\xc2\x92s officers take them for these Karmas to Suchimukha Narakas and pierce\nall over his body with pins, as a tailor does with his cloth. O Devar _s_ i!\nTrue, sinful persons thus suffer hundred thousand hells. All these are very\npainful and tormenting. Out of these the abovenamed twenty hells give the\ngreatest sufferings. O Devar _s_ i! The sinners suffer various pains in hells\nand virtuous persons go to the several spheres where all sorts of happinesses\nand pleasures reign. O Mahar _s_ i! I have described to you many forms of\npractising one\xc2\x92s Sva Dharma; yet know this verily that the worship of the\nDevi\xc2\x92s Gross Form and of Her Virat Form is the Chief Dharma of all the\npersons. By worshipping the Devi, the persons have not to go to the hells. In\nfact, when the Devi Bhagavati is worshipped, She Herself arranges for crossing\nthe person to the other shore of this ocean of transmigration of existence.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-third Chapter of the Eighth Book on the description of\nthe remaining hells in the Maha Pura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of\n18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 24](bk08ch24.htm)\n\n'
