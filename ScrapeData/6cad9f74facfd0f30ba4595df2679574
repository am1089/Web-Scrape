The tuneful pair  \nLike heavenly minstrels sweet and fair  \nIn music's art divinely skilled,  \nTheir saintly master's word fulfilled.  \nLike Rama's self, from whom they came,  \nThey shared their size in face and frame,  \n\np. 11  \n\nAs though from some fair sculptured stone  \nTwo selfsame images had grown.  \nSometimes the pair rose up to sing,  \nSurrounded by a holy ring,  \nWhere seated on the grass bad met  \nFull many a musing anchoret.  \nThen tears bedimmed those gentle eyes,  \nAs transport took them and surprise,  \nAnd as they listened every one  \nCried in delight, Well done! Well done!  \nThose sages versed in holy lore  \nPraised the sweet minstrels more and more:  \nAnd wondered at the singers' skill,  \nAnd the bard's verses sweeter still,  \nWhich laid so clear before the eye  \nThe glorious deeds of days gone by.  \nThus by the virtuous hermits praised,  \nInspirited their voice they raised.  \nPleased with the song this holy man  \nWould give the youths a water-can;  \nOne gave a fair ascetic dress,  \nOr sweet fruit from the wilderness.  \nOne saint a black-deer's hide would bring,  \nAnd one a sacrificial string:  \nOne, a clay pitcher from his hoard,  \nAnd one, a twisted munja cord.  1  \nOne in his joy an axe would find,  \nOne, braid, their plaited locks to bind.  \nOne gave a sacrificial cup,  \nOne rope to tie their fagots up;  \nWhile fuel at their feet was laid,  \nOr hermit's stool of fig-tree made.  \nAll gave, or if they gave not, none  \nForgot at least a benison.  \nSome saints, delighted with their lays,  \nWould promise health and length of days;  \nOthers with surest words would add  \nSome boon to make their spirit glad.  \nIn such degree of honour then  \nThat song was held by holy men:  \nThat living song which life can give,  \nBy which shall many a minstrel live.  \nIn seat of kings, in crowded hall,  \nThey sang the poem, praised of all.  \nAnd Rama chanced to hear their lay,  \nWhile he the votive steed  2 would slay,  \nAnd sent fit messengers to bring  \nThe minstrel pair before the king.  \nThey came, and found the monarch high  \nEnthroned in gold, his brothers nigh;  \nWhile many a minister below,  \nAnd noble, sate in lengthened row.  \n\nThe youthful pair awhile he viewed  \nGraceful in modest attitude,  \nAnd then in words like these addressed  \nHis brother Lakshman and the rest:  \n'Come, listen to the wondrous strain  \nRecited by these godlike twain.  \nSweet singers of a story fraught  \nWith melody and lofty thought.'  \n   The pair, with voices sweet and strong,  \nRolled the full tide of noble song,  \nWith tone and accent deftly blent  \nTo suit the changing argument.  \nMid that assembly loud and clear  \nRang forth that lay so sweet to hear,  \nThat universal rapture stole  \nThrough each man's frame and heart and soul.  \n'These minstrels, blest with every sign  \nThat marks a high and princely line,  \n   In holy shades who dwell,  \nEnshrined in Saint Valmiki's lay,  \nA monument to live for aye,  \n   My deeds in song shall tell.'  \nThus Rama spoke: their breasts were fired,  \nAnd the great tale, as if inspired,  \n   The youths began to sing,  \nWhile every heart with transport swelled,  \nAnd mute and rapt attention held  \n   The concourse and the king,  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[10:1](ry006.htm#fr_55) The twin sons if Rama and Sita, born after Rama had\nrepartiated Sita, and brought up in the hermitage of Valmiki.
