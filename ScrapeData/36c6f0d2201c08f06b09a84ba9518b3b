Not the two others, on account of distinction and statement of\ndifference.\n\nThe section distinguishes the indestructible being, which is the source of\nall, &c., from the Pradhana as well as the individual soul, in so far, namely,\nas it undertakes to prove\n\np. 284\n\nthat by the cognition of one thing everything is known; and it moreover, in\npassages such as 'higher than the high Indestructible,' explicitly states the\ndifference of the indestructible being from those other two.--The text first\nrelates that Brahma told the knowledge of Brahman, which is the foundation of\nthe knowledge of all, to his eldest son Atharvan: this introduces the\nknowledge of Brahman as the topic of the section. Then, the text proceeds, in\norder to obtain this knowledge of Brahman, which had been handed down through\na succession of teachers to Angiras, _S_ aunaka approached Angiras\nrespectfully and asked him: 'What is that through which, if known, all this is\nknown?' i.e. since all knowledge is founded on the knowledge of Brahman, he\nenquires after the nature of Brahman. Angiras replies that he who wishes to\nattain Brahman must acquire two kinds of knowledge, both of them having\nBrahman for their object: an indirect one which springs from the study of the\n_s_ astras, viz. the Veda, _S_ iksha, Kalpa, and so on, and a direct one which\nsprings from concentrated meditation (yoga). The latter kind of knowledge is\nthe means of obtaining Brahman, and it is of the nature of devout meditation\n(bhakti), as characterised in the text 'He whom the Self chooses, by him the\nSelf can be gained' (III, 2, 3). The means again towards this kind of\nknowledge is such knowledge as is gained from sacred tradition, assisted by\nabstention and the other six auxiliary means (sec above, p. 17); in agreement\nwith the text, 'Him the Brahmattas seek to know by the study of the Veda, by\nsacrifice, by gifts, by penance, by fasting' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 22).--Thus\nthe Reverend Para _s_ ara also says, 'The cause of attaining him is knowledge\nand work, and knowledge is twofold, according as it is based on sacred\ntradition or springs from discrimination.' The Mu _nd_ aka-tcxt refers to the\ninferior kind of knowledge in the passage 'the lower knowledge is the _Ri_\ng-veda,' &c., up to 'and the dharma- _s_ astras'; this knowledge is the means\ntowards the intuition of Brahman; while the higher kind of knowledge, which is\ncalled 'upasana,' has the character of devout meditation (bhakti), and\nconsists in direct intuition of Brahman, is\n\np. 285\n\nreferred to in the clause 'the higher knowledge is that by which the\nIndestructible is apprehended.' The text next following, 'That which is\ninvisible, &c., then sets forth the nature of the highest Brahman, which is\nthe object of the two kinds of knowledge previously described. After this the\npassage 'As the spider sends forth and draws in its thread' declares that from\nthat indestructible highest Brahman, as characterised before, there originates\nthe whole universe of things, sentient and non-sentient. The next _s_ oka\n(tapasa _k_ iyate, &c.) states particulars about this origination of the\nuniverse from Brahman. 'Brahman swells through brooding'; through brooding,\ni.e. thought--in agreement with a later text, 'brooding consists of thought'--\nBrahman swells, i.e. through thought in the form of an intention, viz. 'may I\nbecome many,' Brahman becomes ready for creation. From it there springs first\n'anna,' i.e. that which is the object of fruition on the part of all enjoying\nagents, viz. the non-evolved subtle principles of all elements. From this\n'anna' there spring successively breath, mind, and all other effected things\nup to work, which is the means of producing reward in the form of the heavenly\nworld, and Release. The last _s_ loka of the first chapter thereupon first\nstates the qualities, such as omniscience and so on, which capacitate the\nhighest Brahman for creation, and then declares that from the indestructible\nhighest Brahman there springs the effected (karya) Brahman, distinguished by\nname and form, and comprising all enjoying subjects and objects of enjoyment.\n--The first _s_ loka of the second chapter declares first that the highest\nBrahman is absolutely real ('That is true'), and then admonishes those who\ndesire to reach the indestructible highest Self, which possesses all the\nblessed qualities stated before and exists through itself, to turn away from\nother rewards and to perform all those sacrificial works depending on the\nthree sacred fires which were seen and revealed by poets in the four Vedas and\nare incumbent on men according to caste and a _s_ rama. The section 'this is\nyour path' (I, 2, 1) up to 'this is the holy Brahma-world gained by your good\nworks' (I, 2, 6) next states the particular mode\n\np. 286\n\nof performing those works, and declares that an omission of one of the\nsuccessive works enjoined in _D_ ruti and Sm _ri_ ti involves fruitlessness of\nthe works actually performed, and that something not performed in the proper\nway is as good as not performed at all. Stanzas 7 and ff. ('But frail in truth\nare those boats') declare that those who perform this lower class of works\nhave to return again and again into the Sa _m_ sara, because they aim at\nworldly results and are deficient in true knowledge. Stanza 8 ('but those who\npractise penance and faith') then proclaims that works performed by a man\npossessing true knowledge, and hence not aiming at worldly rewards, result in\nthe attainment of Brahman; and stanzas 12 a, 13 ('having examined all these\nworlds') enjoin knowledge, strengthened by due works, on the part of a man who\nhas turned away from _mere_ works, as the means of reaching Brahman; and due\nrecourse to a teacher on the part of him who is desirous of such knowledge.--\nThe first chapter of the second section of the Upanishad (II, 1)then clearly\nteaches how the imperishable highest Brahman, i.e. the highest Self--as\nconstituting the Self of all things and having all things for its body--has\nall things for its outward form and emits all things from itself. The\nremainder of the Upanishad ('Manifest, near,' &c.) teaches how this highest\nBrahman, which is imperishable and higher than the soul, which itself is\nhigher than the Unevolved; which dwells in the highest Heaven; and which is of\nthe nature of supreme bliss, is to be meditated upon as within the hollow of\nthe heart; how this meditation has the character of devout faith (bhakti); and\nhow the devotee, freeing himself from Nescience, obtains for his reward\nintuition of Brahman, which renders him like Brahman.\n\nIt thus clearly appears that 'on account of distinction and statement of\ndifference' the Upanishad does not treat of the Pradhana and the soul. For\nthat the highest Brahman is different from those two is declared in passages\nsuch as 'That heavenly Person is without body; he is both without and within,\nnot produced, without breath and without mind, pure, higher than what is\nhigher than the\n\np. 287\n\n[paragraph continues] Imperishable' (II, 1, 2); for the last words mean 'that\nimperishable highest Self possessing invisibility and similar qualities, which\nis higher than the aggregate of individual souls, which itself is higher than\nthe non-evolved subtle elements.' The term 'akshara' (imperishable) is to be\netymologically explained either as that which pervades (a _s_ nute) or that\nwhich does not pass away (a-ksharati), and is on either of these explanations\napplicable to the highest Self, either because that Self pervades all its\neffects or because it is like the so-called Mahat (which is also called\nakshara), free from all passing away or decaying.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'invisibility and so on.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 24.
