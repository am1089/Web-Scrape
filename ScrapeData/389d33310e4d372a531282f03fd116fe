Sita fell?  \nHow in the wood did Rama eat?  \nWhat was his bed, and what his seat?  \nFull answer to my questions give,  \nFor I on thy replies shall live,  \nAs with the saints Yayati held  \nSweet converse, from the skies expelled.'  \n\nUrged by the lord of men to speak,  \nWhose sobbing voice came faint and weak,  \nThus he, while tears his utterance broke,  \nIn answer to the monarch spoke;  \n'Hear then the words that Rama said,  \nResolved in duty's path to tread.  \nJoining his hands, his head he bent,  \nAnd gave this message, reverent:  \n'Sumantra, to my father go,  \nWhose lofty mind all people know:  \nBow down before him, as is meet,  \nAnd in my stead salute his feet.  \nThen to the queen my mother bend,  \nAnd give the greeting that I send:  \nNe'er may her steps from duty err,  \nAnd may it still be well with her.  \nAnd add this word: 'O Queen, pursue  \nThy vows with faithful heart and true;  \nAnd ever at due season turn  \nWhere holy fires of worship burn.  \nAnd, lady, on our lord bestow  \n\np. 164  \n\nSuch honour as to Gods we owe.  \nBe kind to every queen: let pride  \nAnd thought of self be cast aside.  \nIn the king's fond opinion raise  \nKaikeyi, by respect and praise.  \nLet the young Bharat ever be  \nLoved, honoured as the king by thee:  \nThy king-ward duty ne'er forget:  \nHigh over all are monarchs set.'  \n\nAnd Bharat, too, for me address:  \nPray that all health his life may bless.  \nLet every royal lady share,  \nAs justice bids, his love and care.  \nSay to the strong-armed chief who brings  \nJoy to Iksvaku's line of kings:  \n'As ruling prince thy care be shown  \nOf him, our sire, who holds the throne.  \nStricken in years he feels their weight;  \nBut leave him in his royal state.  \nAs regent heir content thee still,  \nSubmissive to thy father's will.'  \nRama again his charge renewed,  \nAs the hot flood his cheek bedewed:  \n'Hold as thine own my mother dear  \nWho drops for me the longing tear.'  \nThen Lakshman, with his soul on fire,  \nSpake breathing fast these words of ire:  \n'Say, for what sin, for what offence  \nWas royal Rama banished thence?  \nHe is the cause, the king: poor slave  \nTo the light charge Kaikeyi gave.  \nLet right or wrong the motive be,  \nThe author of our woe is he.  \nWhether the exile were decreed  \nThrough foolish faith or guilty greed,  \nFor promises or empire, still  \nThe king has wrought a grievous ill.  \nGrant that the Lord of all saw fit  \nTo prompt the deed and sanction it,  \nIn Rama's life no cause I see  \nFor which the king should bid him flee.  \nHis blinded eye refused to scan  \nThe guilt and folly of the plan,  \nAnd from the weakness of the king  \nHere and hereafter woe shall spring.  \nNo more my sire: the ties that used  \nTo bind me to the king are loosed.  \nMy brother Rama, Raghu's son.  \nTo me is lord, friend, sire in one.  \nThe love of men how can he win,  \nDeserting, by the cruel sin,  \nTheir joy, whose heart is swift to feel  \nA pleasure in the people's weal?  \nShall he whose mandate could expel  \nThe virtuous Rama, loved so well,  \nTo whom his subjects' fond hearts cling--  \nShall he in spite of them be king?'  \n\nBut Janak's child, my lord, stood by,  \nAnd oft the votaress heaved a sigh.  \nShe seemed with dull and wandering sense,  \nBeneath a spirit's influence.  \nThe noble princess, pained with woe  \nWhich till that hour she ne'er could know,  \nTears in her heavy trouble shed,  \nBut not a word to me she said.  \nShe raised her face which grief had dried  \nAnd tenderly her husband eyed,  \nGazed on him as he turned to go  \nWhile tear chased tear in rapid flow.'  \n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto LIX: Das'aratha's Lament.](ry137.htm)\n\n"
