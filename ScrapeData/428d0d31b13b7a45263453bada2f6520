But the rule (over the pra _n_ as) on the part of Fire and the rest,\ntogether with him to whom the pra _n_ a belong (i.e. the soul), is owing to\nthe thinking of that (viz. the highest Self); on account of scriptural\nstatement.\n\np. 576\n\nIt has been shown that the pra _n_ as, together with the main pra _n_ a,\noriginate from Brahman, and have a limited size. That the pra _n_ as are\nguided by Agni and other divine beings has also been explained on a previous\noccasion, viz. under Su. II, 1, 5. And it is known from ordinary experience\nthat the organs are ruled by the individual soul, which uses them as means of\nexperience and fruition. And this is also established by scriptural texts,\nsuch as 'Having taken these pra _n_ as he (i.e. the soul) moves about in his\nown body, according to his pleasure'(B _ri_. Up. II, 1, 18). The question now\narises whether the rule of the soul and of the presiding divine beings over\nthe pra _n_ as depends on them (i.e. the soul and the divinities) only, or on\nsome other being.--On them only, since they depend on no one else!--Not so,\nthe Sutra declares. The rule which light, and so on, i.e. Agni and the other\ndivinities, together with him to whom the pra _n_ as belong i.e. the soul,\nexercise over the pra _n_ as, proceeds from the thinking of that, i.e. from\nthe will of the highest Self.--How is this known?--'From scriptural\nstatement.' For Scripture teaches that the organs, together with their guiding\ndivinities and the individual soul, depend in all their doings on the thought\nof the highest Person. 'He, who abiding within Fire, rules Fire from within.--\nHe, who abiding within the air--within the Self--within the eye, and so on' (B\n_ri_. Up III, 7); 'From fear of it the wind blows, from fear of it the sun\nrises, from fear of it Agni and Indra, yea Death runs as the fifth' (Taitt.\nUp. II, 8, 1); 'By the command of that Imperishable one, sun and moon stand,\nheld apart'(B _ri_ Up III, 8, 9).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 14. And on account of the eternity of this](sbe48312.htm)\n\n"
