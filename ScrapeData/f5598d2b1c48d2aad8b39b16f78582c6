THE LAW OF DEBT.\n\n1. 1 A creditor should never lend money without having first secured a pledge of adequate value, or a\n\np. 320\n\ndeposit, or a trustworthy surety; nor without a bond written (by the debtor\nhimself) or attested (by subscribing witnesses).\n\n2. 2 That (loan) is termed kusida (a loan on interest) which is exacted by persons apprehending no sin (from the act), from a mean (kutsita) or wretched (sidat) man, after having been increased to four or eight times the original amount (through the interest accruing on it).\n\n3. 3 An eightieth part (of the principal) accrues as interest on it (every month); and it is certainly doubled by such interest within a third of a year less than seven years (that is to say, within six years and eight months).\n\n4. 4 Interest is declared (by some) to be of four\n\np. 321\n\nsorts; by others, it is stated to be fivefold; and by others again, it is said\nto be of six kinds. Learn their (various) qualities.\n\n5\\. Kayika (bodily interest); kalika (periodical interest); _k_ akrav _ri_\nddhi (compound interest); karita (stipulated interest); _s_ ikhav _ri_ ddhi\n(hair-interest); and bhogalabha (interest by enjoyment): such are the six\nkinds of interest.\n\n6. 6 Kayika interest is connected with bodily labour; kalika is due every month; _k_ akrav _ri_ ddhi is interest on interest; karita is interest promised by the borrower.\n\n7, 8. When interest is received every day, it is termed _s_ ikhav _ri_ ddhi\n(hair-interest, because it grows every day). Because it grows constantly like\nhair, and does not cease growing except on the loss of the head, that is to\nsay, on payment of the principal, therefore it is called hair-interest. The\nuse of a (mortgaged) house, or the produce of a field, is termed bhogalabha\n(interest by enjoyment).\n\n9. 9 That karita (stipulated) interest has to be paid always, which has been stipulated by the debtor himself, over and above (the ordinary rate of interest), and has been promised in times of distress.\n\n10. 10 When (such special) interest has been stipulated in any other manner, it must not be paid by any means.\n\n11. 11 Hair-interest, bodily interest, and interest by\n\np. 322\n\nenjoyment shall be taken by the creditor so long as the principal remains\nunpaid.\n\n12. 12 But the use of a pledge after twice the principal has been realised from it, compound interest, and the exaction of the principal and interest (together as principal) is usury and reprehensible.\n\n13. 13 On gold (and other precious metals), the interest may make (the debt) double; on clothes and base metals (such as tin or lead), treble; on grain, it is allowed to rise to four times the original amount, and so on edible plants (or fruit), beasts of burden, and wool.\n\n14\\. It is allowed to make (the debt) quintuple, on pot-herbs; sextuple, on\nseeds and sugar-cane; and it may make (the debt) octuple, on salt, oil, and\nspirituous liquor.\n\n15\\. Likewise, on sugar and honey, if the loan be of old standing.\n\n16. 16 On grass, wood, bricks, thread, substances from which spirits may be extracted, leaves, bones, leather, weapons, flowers, and fruits, no interest is ordained.\n\n17. 17 A pledge is termed bandha, and is declared to\n\np. 323\n\nbe of four sorts; movable or immovable; to be kept only or to be used; to be\nreleased at any time, or limited as to time; stated in writing, or stipulated\n(orally) before witnesses.\n\n18. 18 Should the creditor, actuated by avarice, use a pledge before interest has ceased to accrue on the loan (on becoming equal to the principal), or before the fixed period has expired, such use shall be stopped.\n\n19\\. The pledge has to be kept carefully, like a deposit; interest is\nforfeited in case of its being damaged.\n\n20. 20 A pledge having been used and rendered worthless (by such use), the principal (itself) is lost; if a very valuable pledge be spoiled, he must satisfy the pledger.\n\n21. 21 If a pledge be destroyed by a fatal accident or by an act of the king, the debtor shall be caused either to deliver another pledge or to pay the debt.\n\n22. 22 When the debtor restores the principal and asks for his pledge, it must be restored to him; otherwise the creditor is liable to punishment.\n\np. 324\n\n23. 23 When a field or other (immovable property) has been enjoyed, and more than the principal realised by it, then the debtor shall recover his pledge, if the principal and interest has been actually got out of it (by the creditor).\n\n24\\. (This law applies) when the debtor delivers a field to the creditor, with\nthe following stipulation, 'This (field) shall be enjoyed by you, when\ninterest has ceased (on becoming equal to the principal), that is certain.\nWhen the principal has been realised together with the interest, you shall\nrestore (the field) to me.'\n\n25. 25 When the time (for payment) has passed and interest has ceased (on becoming equal to the principal), the creditor shall be owner of the pledge; but, till ten days have elapsed, the debtor is entitled to redeem it.\n\n26. 26 Notice having been given to the debtor's family, a pledge to be kept (only) may be used, after the principal has been doubled; and so may a pledge for a fixed period, on the expiration of that term.\n\n27. 27 When the principal has been doubled, or the stipulated period expired in the case of a pledge delivered for a certain time only, the creditor\n\np. 325\n\nbecomes owner of the pledge, after having waited for a fortnight.\n\n28\\. If the debtor should pay the debt during that interval, he may recover\nhis pledge (even then).\n\n29. 29 When the amount of the debt has been doubled (by the interest accruing on it), and the debtor is either dead or no longer present, (the creditor) may take his chattel and sell it before witnesses.\n\n30\\. Or, its value having been estimated in an assembly, he may keep it for\nten days; after which, having realised a sufficient sum to cover his demand,\nhe should relinquish the balance.\n\n31. 31 When a man neither enjoys a pledge, nor obtains it (from the debtor), nor points it out (to others), his written contract (concerning the pledge) is invalid, (just like) a document when the (subscribing) witnesses and debtor are dead.\n\n32. 32 When a house or field has been mortgaged for use and the period (fixed for such use) has not expired, the debtor cannot recover his property, nor can the creditor (recover) his loan.\n\n33\\. When the (stipulated) period has elapsed, both\n\np. 326\n\nparties are at liberty to do so. But, even before (the stipulated period) has\nelapsed, they may make an arrangement by mutual consent.\n\n34. 34 Where one field has been mortgaged to two creditors at the same time, it shall belong to that mortgagee who was the first to obtain possession of it.\n\n35. 35 If both have possessed it for an equal time, it shall be held in common (or shared equally) by them. The same rule is ordained in the case of a gift or a sale.\n\n36. 36 Which course should be adopted in cases of a competition between three different acts, the identical property having been sold, mortgaged, and given away on one and the same day?\n\n37\\. The three parties should divide that lawful property of theirs among\nthemselves in proportionate shares, the two first in the ratio of their\nrespective claims, whereas the donee ought to obtain a full third.\n\n38. 38 The pledgee can never be compelled to restore the pledge against his will, before the whole amount due to him has been paid, nor must (the pledge be obtained from him) by deceit or by (the mode called) _K_ arita.\n\np. 327\n\n39. 39 For appearance, for confidence, for payment, and for delivering the assets of the debtor: it is for these four different purposes that sureties have been ordained by the sages in the system (of law).\n\n40. 40 The first says, 'I will produce (that man);' the second (says), 'He is a respectable man;' the third (says), 'I will pay the debt; the fourth (says), 'I will deliver his assets.'\n\n41. 41 If the debtors fail in their engagements, the two first (sureties themselves, but not their sons) must pay the sum lent at the appointed time; both the two last (sureties), and in default of them their sons (are liable for the debt), when the debtors break their promise (to pay the debt).\n\n42. 42 The creditor should allow time for the surety to search for a debtor who has absconded; a fortnight, a month, a month and a half, according to (the distance of) the place (where he is supposed to be hiding himself).\n\n43\\. (Sureties) must not be excessively harassed; they should be made to pay\nthe debt by instalments;\n\np. 328\n\nthey must not be attacked when the debtor is present: such is the law\nregarding sureties.\n\n44. 44 When (a surety), being harassed, pays a proved debt which he has vouched for, (the debtor) shall pay him twice as much, after the lapse of a month and a half.\n\n45. 45 Should foolish (sureties) in good faith pay the debt, though not required to do so, or on being required to pay a different debt, how and from whom can they recover that sum?\n\n46. 46 By whom, to whom, and how, should, or should not, be paid a loan which has been received from the hands of another man in the shape of a loan on interest, will now be declared.\n\n47. 47 A loan shall be restored on demand, if no time has been fixed (for its restoration); or on the expiration of the time (if a definite period has been fixed); or when interest ceases (on becoming equal to the principal). If the father is no longer alive, (the debt must be paid) by his sons.\n\n48. 48 The father's debt must be paid first of all, and after that, a man's own debt; but a debt contracted by the paternal grandfather must always be paid before these two even.\n\n49. 49 The father's debt, on being proved, must be paid by the sons as if it were their own; the grandfather's debt must be paid (by his son's sons) without\n\np. 329\n\ninterest; but the son of a grandson need not pay it at all.\n\n50. 50 When a debt has been incurred, for the benefit of the household, by an uncle, brother, son, wife, slave, pupil, or dependant, it must be paid by the head of the family.\n\n51. 51 Sons shall not be made to pay (a debt incurred by their father) for spirituous liquor, for losses at play, for idle gifts, for promises made under the influence of love or wrath, or for suretyship, nor the balance of a fine or toll (liquidated in part by their father).\n\n52. 52 The liability for the debts devolves on the successor to the estate, when the son is involved in calamity; or on the taker of the widow, in default of a successor to the estate.\n\n53. 53 Debts contracted by the wives of distillers of spirituous liquor, hunters, washermen, herdsmen, barbers or the like persons, shall be paid by their protector; they were contracted for the affairs of their husbands.\n\n54. 54 When (a debtor) has acknowledged a debt, it may be recovered from him by the expedients of friendly expostulation and the rest, by moral suasion,\n\np. 330\n\nby artful management, by compulsion, and by confinement at his house.\n\n55. 55 When a debtor is caused to pay by the advice of friends or kinsmen, by friendly remonstrances, by constant following, or by (the creditor) starving himself to death, it is termed moral suasion.\n\n56. 56 When a creditor, with a crafty design, borrows anything from his debtor, for his own use, or withholds an Anvahita deposit or the like, and thus enforces payment of the debt, it is termed artful management.\n\n57. 57 When a debtor is fettered and conducted into (the creditor's) own house, where he is compelled to pay the debt by beating or other (forcible) means, it is called compulsion.\n\n58. 58 When a debtor is made to pay by confining his wife, son or cattle, and by watching at his door, it is termed \xc3\x82 _k_ arita (the customary mode).\n\n59. 59 An indigent debtor may be taken to his own house by the creditor and compelled to do work there, such as distilling spirits and the like; but a Brahman must be made to pay gradually.\n\np. 331\n\n60. 60 When the time fixed (for payment) has elapsed, and the interest has ceased (on becoming equal to the principal), the debtor may either recover his loan or cause a new bond to be written in the form of compound interest.\n\n61. 61 As compound interest is taken on the doubled principal, so does the use of a pledge (become a new principal), the debt together with the interest being considered as the (new) principal.\n\n62. 62 This rule concerns an acknowledged (debt); but (a debtor) denying (his liability) shall be compelled to pay, on the debt being proved in a (judicial) assembly by a document or by witnesses.\n\n63. 63 (A debtor) claiming judicial investigation in a doubtful case, shall never be put under restraint (by the creditor). He who puts under restraint one not liable to such treatment, shall be fined according to law.\n\n64. 64 A debtor who makes a declaration in this form, 'What may be found to be justly due, that I will pay,' is termed 'one claiming judicial investigation.'\n\n65. 65 When there is a difference of opinion between the two parties regarding the nature (of the loan), or the number or the like, or the (amount of) interest,\n\np. 332\n\nor whether the sum be due or not, it is termed a doubtful case.\n\n66. 66 Should a man, after recovering his debt by moral suasion or one of the other modes, fail to receipt it on the bond, or to give a deed of acquittance; it shall yield interest (to the debtor).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[319:1](sbe3369.htm#fr_1009) XI, 1. May. p. 102; Col. Dig. I, 1, 11. The\ncommentators agree p. 320 in explaining the term adhi, 'a pledge,' as denoting\na pledge to be used, such as e.g. a cow to be used with her milk, or landed\nproperty pledged together with its produce. The term bandha, 'a deposit,' is\nsupposed to denote a pledge which must not be used; according to the Mayukha,\nhowever, it means a pledge which is not actually delivered to the creditor,\nthe debtor merely promising not to alienate it. 'A pledge of adequate value'\nis one corresponding in value to the principal together with the interest.\nViram. p. 293. The term sakshimat, 'attested,' is referred to a debt\ncontracted orally before witnesses, both by Colebrooke (Dig. I, 1, 11) and\nMandlik (May. loc. cit.). This, however, is opposed to the gloss of the\nViramitrodaya.\n\n[320:2](sbe3369.htm#fr_1010) May. p. 102; Col. Dig. I; 1, 3. It is hardly\nnecessary to point out that the etymology here proposed of the term kusida, 'a\nloan on interest,' is entirely fanciful. It is really derived from ku and\nsida, and denotes 'that which adheres closely, and cannot easily be got rid\nof.' The commentators explain the clause 'apprehending no sin' to imply that\nit is sinful otherwise to accept a gift from an unworthy person.\n\n[320:3](sbe3369.htm#fr_1011) Sm _ri_ ti _k_.; Col. Dig.

The Viramitrodaya reads _k_ armasthivarma _n_ am, 'leather, bones, and\narmour.'\n\n[322:16](sbe3369.htm#fr_1019) The commentators observe that no interest should\nbe exacted, unless there be a special agreement to the purpose. There is,\nhowever, another reading (v _ri_ ddhis tu na nivartate), under which the\npurport of this rule becomes quite different, viz. that there is absolutely no\nlimit regarding the interest on the articles mentioned in it. This version is\nin harmony with the corresponding regulations of other legislators.\n\n[322:17](sbe3369.htm#fr_1020) Col. Dig.

Under the\nreading of the other compilations, payment of the debt together with interest\nis enjoined. 'A king,' i.e. a ruler who offends against the dictates of\nreligion. Viram.\n\n[323:22](sbe3369.htm#fr_1024) Col. Dig. I, 3, 103; Viram. p. 319. The rule\nthat the principal only needs to be restored concerns a pledge for use. In the\ncase of a pledge for custody, interest has to be paid besides the principal.\nViram.\n\n[324:23](sbe3369.htm#fr_1025) Col. Dig. I, 3, 108; May. p. 107.\n\n23, 24. Viram. p. 320. Under a stipulation of this sort, the mortgagee shall\nrecover his pledge, as soon as the creditor has fully realised his demand out\nof the mortgage, no matter whether he has contributed little or much himself\ntowards its realisation. Viram. The Ratnakara (p. 29) inserts the following\ntext after 24, 'This lawful rule has been proclaimed with regard to loans on\ninterest and so forth.'\n\n[324:25](sbe3369.htm#fr_1026) Col. Dig. I, 3, 115; Viram. p. 316.\n\n[324:26](sbe3369.htm#fr_1027) Viram. p. 316; Col. Dig. I, 3, 119 ('Sm _ri_\nti').\n\n[324:27](sbe3369.htm#fr_1028) 27, 28. Viram. p. 315.

The balance should be handed over to the relatives of the\ndebtor or to the king. Colebrooke's Digest has another text after these two,\nin which it is stated that the precise amount of the debt should be\nascertained by persons skilled in computation.\n\n[325:31](sbe3369.htm#fr_1030) Col.

In\nordinary cases, p. 326 the recovery of the loan, attended by the restoration\nof the pledge to the pledger, takes place after the lapse of the stipulated\nperiod. By mutual consent, however, it may take place before that time.\n\n[326:34](sbe3369.htm#fr_1032) The term 'a field' includes by implication any\npledge for use. Viram. p. 312.
