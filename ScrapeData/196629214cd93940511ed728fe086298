The sage Vyasa\nis here represented, not as the author, but the arranger or compiler of the\nVedas, the Itihasas, and Puran\xcc\x81as. His name denotes his character, meaning the\n'arranger' or 'distributor;' and the recurrence of\n\np. lxiii\n\nmany Vyasas, many individuals who new modelled the Hindu scriptures, has\nnothing in it that is improbable, except the fabulous intervals by which their\nlabours are separated. The rearranging, the refashioning, of old materials, is\nnothing more than the progress of time would be likely to render necessary.\nThe last recognised compilation is that of Krishn\xcc\x81a Dwaipayan\xcc\x81a, assisted by\nBrahmans, who were already conversant with the subjects respectively assigned\nto them. They were the members of a college or school, supposed by the Hindus\nto have flourished in a period more remote, no doubt, than the truth, but not\nat all unlikely to have been instituted at some time prior to the accounts of\nIndia which we owe to Greek writers, and in which we see enough of the system\nto justify our inferring that it was then entire. That there have been other\nVyasas and other schools since that date, that Brahmans unknown to fame have\nremodelled some of the Hindu scriptures, and especially the Puran\xcc\x81as, cannot\nreasonably be contested, after dispassionately weighing the strong internal\nevidence which all of them afford of the intermixture of unauthorized and\ncomparatively modern ingredients. But the same internal testimony furnishes\nproof equally decisive of the anterior existence of ancient materials; and it\nis therefore as idle as it is irrational to dispute the antiquity or\nauthenticity of the greater portion of the contents of the Puran\xcc\x81as, in the\nface of abundant positive and circumstantial evidence of the prevalence of the\ndoctrines which they teach, the currency of the legends which they narrate,\nand the integrity of the institutions which they describe, at least three\ncenturies before the Christian era. But the origin and developement of their\ndoctrines, traditions, and institutions, were not the work of a day; and the\ntestimony that establishes their existence three centuries before\nChristianity, carries it back to a much more remote antiquity, to an antiquity\nthat is probably not surpassed by any of the prevailing fictions,\ninstitutions, or belief, of the ancient world.\n\nThe remainder of the third book describes the leading institutions of the\nHindus, the duties of castes, the obligations of different stages of life, and\nthe celebration of obsequial rites, in a short but primitive strain, and in\nharmony with the laws of Manu. It is a distinguishing feature of the\n\np. lxiv\n\nVishn\xcc\x81u Puran\xcc\x81a, and it is characteristic of its being the work of an earlier\nperiod than most of the Puran\xcc\x81as, that it enjoins no sectarial or other acts\nof supererogation; no Vratas, occasional self-imposed observances; no\nholidays, no birthdays of Krishn\xcc\x81a, no nights dedicated to Lakshmi; no\nsacrifices nor modes of worship other than those conformable to the ritual of\nthe Vedas. It contains no Mahatmyas, or golden legends, even of the temples in\nwhich Vishn\xcc\x81u is adored.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Fourth Book](vp028.htm)\n\n"
