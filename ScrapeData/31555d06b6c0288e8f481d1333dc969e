This (nishkevalya- _s_ astra) becomes perfect as a thousand of B _ri_ hati\nverses. In this thousand of B _ri_ hatis there are one thousand one hundred\nand twenty-five Anush _t_ ubhs. For the smaller is contained in the larger.\n\n2\\. This has been said by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. VIII, 76, 12):--\n\n3\\. 'A speech of eight feet;'--because there are eight feet of four syllables\neach in the Anush _t_ ubh.\n\n4\\. 'Of nine corners;'--because the B _ri_ hati becomes nine-cornered (having\nnine feet of four syllables each).\n\n5\\. 'Touching the truth;'--because speech (Anush _t_ ubh) is truth, touched by\nthe verse (B _ri_ hati) 1.\n\n6\\. 'He (the Hot _ri_ ) makes the body out of Indra;--'for out of this\nthousand of B _ri_ hati verses turned into Anush _t_ ubhs, and therefore out\nof Pra _n_ a as connected with Indra 2, and out of the B _ri_ hati (which is\nPra _n_ a), he makes speech, that is Anush _t_ ubh, as a body 3.\n\n7\\. This Mahaduktha is the highest development\n\np. 230\n\nof speech, and it is fivefold, viz. measured, not measured, music, true, and\nuntrue.\n\n8\\. A _Ri_ _k_ verse, a gatha 1, a kumbya 2 are measured (metrical). A Ya _g_\nus line, an invocation, and general remarks 3, these are not measured (they\nare in prose). A Saman, or any portion (parvan) of it, is music. Om is true,\nNa is untrue.\n\n9\\. What is true (Om) is the flower and fruit of speech. He is able to become\ncelebrated and of good report, for he speaks the true (Om), the flower and\nfruit of speech.\n\n10\\. Now the untrue is the root 4 of speech, and as a tree whose root is\nexposed dries up and perishes, thus a man who says what is untrue exposes his\nroot, dries up and perishes. Therefore one should not say what is untrue, but\nguard oneself from it.\n\n11\\. That syllable Om (yes) goes forward (to the first cause of the world) and\nis empty. Therefore if a man says Om (yes) to everything, then that (which he\ngives away) is wanting to him here 5. If he says Om (yes) to everything, then\nhe would empty himself, and would not be capable of any enjoyments.\n\n12\\. That syllable Na (no) is full for oneself 6. If a man says No to\neverything, then his reputation\n\np. 231\n\nwould become evil, and that would ruin him even here.\n\n13\\. Therefore let a man give at the proper time only, not at the wrong time.\nThus he unites the true and the untrue, and from the union of those two he\ngrows, and becomes greater and greater.\n\n14\\. He who knows this speech of which this (the mahaduktha) is a development,\nhe is clever. A is the whole of speech, and manifested through different kinds\nof contact (mutes) and of wind (sibilants), it becomes manifold and different.\n\n15\\. Speech if uttered in a whisper is breath, if spoken aloud, it is body.\nTherefore (if whispered) it is almost hidden, for what is incorporeal is\nalmost hidden, and breath is incorporeal. But if spoken aloud, it is body, and\ntherefore it is perceptible, for body is perceptible.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[229:1](sbe01219.htm#fr_566) Va _k_ , speech, taking the form of Anush _t_\nubh, and being joined with the _Ri_ _k_ , or the B _ri_ hati, touches the\ntrue, i. e. Pra _n_ a, breath, which is to be meditated on under the form of\nthe B _ri_ hati. Comm.\n\n[229:2](sbe01219.htm#fr_567) Cf. Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 2, 3, 4.\n\n[229:3](sbe01219.htm#fr_568) Because the Anush _t_ ubh is made out of the B\n_ri_ hati, the B _ri_ hati being breath, therefore the Anush _t_ ubh is called\nits body.\n\n[230:1](sbe01219.htm#fr_569) A gatha is likewise in verse, for instance, prata\n_h_ pratar an _ri_ ta _m_ te vadanti.\n\n[230:2](sbe01219.htm#fr_570) A kumbya is a metrical precept, such as, brahma\n_k_ aryasyapo _s_ ana _m_ karma kuru, divi ma svapsi _h_ , &c.\n\n[230:3](sbe01219.htm#fr_571) Such as arthavadas, explanatory passages, also\ngossip, such as is common in the king's palace, laughing at people, &c.\n\n[230:4](sbe01219.htm#fr_572) As diametrically opposed to the flowers and\nfruits which represent the true. Comm.\n\n[230:5](sbe01219.htm#fr_573) Then that man is left empty here on earth for\nthat enjoyment. Comm.\n\n[230:6](sbe01219.htm#fr_574) He who always says No, keeps everything to\nhimself.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 3, 7](sbe01220.htm)\n\n"
