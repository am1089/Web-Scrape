Now, therefore, we will explain the rule of the _K_ andraya _n_ a (lunar\npenance). 1\n\n2\\. Let him fast on the fourteenth day of the bright half of the month.\n\n3\\. Having had the hair on his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his\nnails, or his beard alone, cut, let him enter, dressed, in new clothes and\nspeaking the truth, the place where the sacrificial fire is preserved.\n\n4\\. There a (common) fire, (which may be) fetched once (only, shall serve)\nhim; or (the fire) must be produced by friction with the Ara _n_ is. 4\n\n5\\. Let a student, who is a friend (of the performer), be ready at hand to\n(carry out his) directions;\n\n6\\. And sacrificial viands (shall be his) food during the performance of the\nvow.\n\n7\\. Having heaped fuel on the fire, scattered (Ku _s_ a grass) around it, and\nperformed (the ceremonies) up to the end of the Agnimukha, he offers burnt\noblations, (cutting off portions) from the cooked food,\n\n8\\. (The first) to Agni, (the second) to the lunar day whichever it may be,\n(the third and the fourth) 8\n\np. 304\n\nto the lunar mansion together with its guardian deity, the fifth to the moon\n(with the verse), 'Atraha gor amanvata,' the sixth to the sky and the earth,\nthe seventh to day and night, the eighth to Rudra, the ninth to the sun, the\ntenth to Varu _n_ a, the eleventh to Indra, and the twelfth to all the gods.\n\n9\\. Now they mention (the following) other (oblations which are to be offered)\nto the points of the horizon and to their (guardian) deities, to the wide\nmiddle sphere and to its (guardian) deity.\n\n10\\. Having offered (the oblation) to Agni Svish _t_ ak _ri_ t (with the\nverse), 'Ever new,' &c., he then places the remainder of the sacrificial\nviands into a goblet (ka _m_ sa) or a cup ( _k_ amasa), pours seasoning, that\nis fit for sacrifices, over them, and eats fifteen morsels of ordinary size,\n10\n\n11\\. The first (saying, 'I offer) thee to Pra _n_ a,' the second (saying,' I\noffer) thee to Apana,' the third (saying, 'I offer) thee to Vyana,' the fourth\n(saying, 'I offer) thee to Udana,' the fifth (saying, 'I offer) thee to\nSamana.' If there are only four (mouthfuls, he eats) the first reciting two\n(texts); if there are three, (he eats) the first two reciting two (texts) with\neach; if there are two, (he eats) the first reciting two (texts and) the\nsecond reciting three texts; (if, there is only) one, (he recites) all (the\nfive texts) together. 11\n\n12\\. Having drunk water (with the text), 'Thou 12\n\np. 305\n\nart water used for moistening Soma,' &c., he then offers the (following)\nadditional oblations of clarified butter, with the seven Anuvakas (beginning),\n'May my Pra _n_ a, Apana, Vyana, Udana, and Samana be purified;' 'May my\nvoice, mind, eye, ear,' &c.; 'May my head, hands, feet;' 'May my skin;' 'May\nthe sense of hearing, touch;' 'May earth, water;' 'May that which consists of\nfood.'\n\n13\\. (The ceremonies) beginning with the muttering (of sacred texts) and\nending with the gift of a cow as a fee are known. 13\n\n14\\. He worships the sun with (three verses) ad--dressed to Surya and the moon\nwith (three verses) addressed to _K_ andramas. 14\n\n15\\. When he goes to rest, he mutters (the verse), 'O fire, keep thou good\nwatch,' 15\n\n16\\. When he awakes (in the morning, the verse), 'O fire, thou art the\nprotector of vows.' 16\n\n17\\. Let him not talk with women and _S_ udras addressing them first; let him\nnot look at urine and ordure.\n\n18\\. If he has seen any impure substance, he mutters (the text), 'Unrestrained\n(was) the internal organ, wretched my eye; the sun is the most 18\n\np. 306\n\nexcellent among the lights of heaven; O initiation, mayest thou not forsake\nme.'\n\n19\\. On the first day of the latter half (of the month he eats) fourteen\nmouthfuls.\n\n20\\. Thus (he takes every day) one (mouthful) less up to the day of the new\nmoon.\n\n21\\. On the day of the new moon there is not (even) one mouthful (left to\ntake).\n\n22\\. On the first day of the first half (of the month) one (mouthful may be\neaten), on the second two.\n\n23\\. Thus he daily increases (his meal) by one (mouthful) up to the day of the\nfull moon.\n\n24\\. On the day of the full moon he offers a Sthalipaka  to Agni, to the lunar\nday whichever it may be, and to the lunar mansions as well as to their\n(guardian) deities.\n\n25\\. Having offered a burnt oblation to (the lunar mansion) Abhi _g_ it (which\nstands) before _S_ ro _n_ a, and to its (guardian) deity, he must give a cow\nto the Brahma _n_ as.\n\n26\\. That is the ant-shaped lunar penance; (that which is performed in the)\ninverted (order is called) the barleycorn-shaped (lunar penance). 26\n\n27\\. A sinner who has performed either of these two (penances) becomes free\nfrom all mortal sins (pataka).\n\n28\\. They declare that the ( _K_ andraya _n_ a) shall be performed for the\nsake of the fulfilment of wishes of all kinds.\n\n29\\. 'Thereby man obtains every wish which he may conceive.'\n\np. 307\n\n30\\. 'Thereby the sages formerly purified themselves and accomplished their\nobjects. That (rite) procures wealth, spiritual merit, sons, cattle, long\nlife, heavenly bliss, and fame; it secures the fulfilment of all desires.'\n\n31\\. 'He who studies this, becomes the companion of the lunar constellations,\nof sun and moon, and dwells in their world.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[303:1](sbe1480.htm#fr_1374) **8**. For this chapter compare Gautama XXVII.\n\n[303:4](sbe1480.htm#fr_1375) The meaning of the Sutra is that the fire which\nhas been carried into the avasatha must be kept burning during the whole month\nwhich the _K_ andraya _n_ a lasts. For a burnt oblation has to be performed at\nthe end of the penance. Should it be extinguished, it must be rekindled by\nfriction.\n\n[303:8](sbe1480.htm#fr_1376) The text quoted occurs Taitt. Brahma _n_ a I, 5,\n8, 1.\n\n[304:10](sbe1480.htm#fr_1377) Taitt. Sa _m_ hita II, 3, 5, 3.\n\n[304:11](sbe1480.htm#fr_1378) This is an imitation of the Pra _n_ agnihotra\ndescribed above, II, 7, 12.\n\n[304:12](sbe1480.htm#fr_1379) Taitt. Sa _m_ hita III, 1, 8, 1. The seven\nAnuvakas are Taitt. \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka X, 51-57. One oblation is to be offered with\neach Anuvaka.\n\n[305:13](sbe1480.htm#fr_1380) Govinda here mentions that the whole of the\nceremonies alluded to are the uttara _m_ darvihomika _m_ tantram.\n\n[305:14](sbe1480.htm#fr_1381) As Govinda states, the former verses are 'ud\nvaya _m_ tamasas pari,' Taitt.
