The northern rays of the sun are the honey-cells on the left. The (hymns\nof the) Atharva\xe1\xb9\x85giras are the bees, the Itihasa-pura _n_ a 1 (the reading of\nthe old stories) is the flower, the water is the nectar.\n\np. 40\n\n2\\. Those very hymns of the Atharva\xe1\xb9\x85giras (as bees) brooded over the Itihasa-\npura _n_ a; and from it, thus brooded on, sprang as its (nectar) essence,\nfame, glory of countenance, vigour, strength, and health.\n\n3\\. That flowed forth, and went towards the sun. And that forms what we call\nthe extreme dark (para _h_ k _ri_ sh _n_ am) light of the sun.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[39:1](sbe01062.htm#fr_164) As there is no Atharva-veda sacrifice, properly so\ncalled, we have corresponding to the Atharva-veda hymns the so-called fifth p.\n40 Veda, the Itihasa-pura _n_ a. This may mean the collection of legends and\ntraditions, or the old book of traditions. At all events it is taken as one\nPura _n_ a, not as many. These ancient stories were repeated at the A _s_\nvamedha sacrifice during the so-called Pariplava nights. Many of them have\nbeen preserved in the Brahma _n_ as; others, in a more modern form, in the\nMahabharata. See Weber, Indische Studien, I, p. 258, note.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 5](sbe01063.htm)\n\n'
