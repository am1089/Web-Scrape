The Varaha Puran\xcc\x81a\n\n12\\. Varaha Puran\xcc\x81a. "That in which the glory of the great Varaha is\npredominant, as it was revealed to Earth by Vishn\xcc\x81u, in connexion, wise Munis,\nwith the Manava Kalpa, and which contains twenty-four thousand verses, is\ncalled the Varaha Puran\xcc\x81a 68."\n\nIt may be doubted if the Varaha Puran\xcc\x81a of the present day is here intended.\nIt is narrated by Vishn\xcc\x81u as Varaha, or in the boar incarnation, to the\npersonified Earth. Its extent, however, is not half that specified, little\nexceeding ten thousand stanzas. It furnishes also itself\n\np. xlv\n\nevidence of the prior currency of some other work, similarly denominated; as,\nin the description of Mathura contained in it, Sumantu, a Muni, is made to\nobserve, "The divine Varaha in former times expounded a Puran\xcc\x81a, for the\npurpose of solving the perplexity of Earth."\n\nNor can the Varaha Puran\xcc\x81a be regarded as a Puran\xcc\x81a agreeably to the common\ndefinition, as it contains but a few scattered and brief allusions to the\ncreation of the world, and the reign of kings: it has no detailed genealogies\neither of the patriarchal or regal families, and no account of the reigns of\nthe Manus. Like the Linga Puran\xcc\x81a, it is a religious manual, almost wholly\noccupied with forms of prayer, and rules for devotional observances, addressed\nto Vishn\xcc\x81u; interspersed with legendary illustrations, most of which are\npeculiar to itself, though some are taken from the common and ancient stock:\nmany of them, rather incompatibly with the general scope of the compilation,\nrelate to the history of \xc5\x9aiva and Durga 69. A considerable portion of the work\nis devoted to descriptions of various Tirthas, places of Vaishn\xcc\x81ava\npilgrimage; and one of Mathura enters into a variety of particulars relating\nto the shrines of that city, constituting the Mathura Mahatmyam.\n\nIn the sectarianism of the Varaha Puran\xcc\x81a there is no leaning to the\nparticular adoration of Krishn\xcc\x81a, nor are the Rath-yatra and Janmasht\xcc\x81ami\nincluded amongst the observances enjoined. There are other indications of its\nbelonging to an earlier stage of Vaishn\xcc\x81ava worship, and it may perhaps be\nreferred to the age of Ramanuja, the early part of the twelfth century.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[xliv:68](vp016.htm#fr_67) [![](tn/generic.jpg)  \nClick to view](img/_04400.jpg)\n\n[xlv:69](vp016.htm#fr_68) One of these is translated by Col. Vans Kennedy, the\norigin of the three \xc5\x9aaktis, or goddesses, Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Parvati.\nAncient and Hindu Mythology, p. 209. The Tri \xc5\x9aakti Mahatmya occurs, as he\ngives it, in my copy, and is so far an indication of the identity of the\nVaraha Puran\xcc\x81a in the different MSS.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 13.
