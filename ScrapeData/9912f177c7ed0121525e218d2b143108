We crave this  \ngracious favour of the Gods to-day.  \n18 Like barren cows, moreover, swelled the waters: singers  \n[approached](errata.htm#16) thy holy cult, O Indra.  \nCome thou to us as to his team comes Vayu. Thou through  \nour solemn hymns bestowest bounty.  \n19 Ye Cows, protect the fount. The two mighty Ones bless the  \nsacrifice.  \nThe handles twain are wrought of gold.  \n20 Now when the Sun hath risen to-day may sinless Mitra,  \nAryaman,  \nBhaga, and Savitar speed us forth.  \n21 Pour on the juice the ornament which reaches both the  \nheaven and earth;\n\np. 270\n\nSupply the liquid to the Bull.  \nThou in the first old time. See, Vena.  \n22 As he was rising up they all revered him: self-luminous he  \ntravels, clothed in splendour.  \nThat is the Bull's, the Asura's lofty nature: he, Omniform,  \nhath reached the eternal waters.  \n23 I laud your Mighty One who joyeth in the juice, him who  \nis good to all men, who pervadeth all;  \nIndra whose conquering strength is powerful in war, whose  \nfame and manly vigour Heaven and Earth revere.  \n24 Great is their fuel, strung their laud, wide is their sacrificial  \npost  \nWhose Friend is Indra, ever young.  \n25 Come, Indra, and delight thee with the juice at all the  \nSoma feasts,  \nConqueror, mighty in thy strength.  \n26 Leading his band, Indra encompassed Vritra; weak grew  \nthe wily leader of enchanters.  \nHe who burns fierce in forests slaughtered Vyamsa, and  \nmade the milch-kine of the nights apparent.  \n27 Whence comest thou alone, thou who art mighty, Indra,  \nLord of the Brave? What is thy purpose?  \nThou greetest us, encountering us the Bright Ones. Lord of  \nBay Steeds, say what thou hast against us.  \nIndra, great in his power and might. Ne\xc2\x92er art thou fruitless.  \nNever art thou neglectful.\n\np. 271\n\n28 Those men extolled that deed of thine, O Indra, those who  \nwould fain burst through the stall of cattle,  \nFain to milk her who bare but once, great, lofty, whose sons  \nare many and her streams a thousand.  \n29 To thee the Mighty One I bring this mighty hymn, for thy  \ndesire hath been gratified by my laud.  \nIn Indra, yea, in him victorious through his might, the  \nGods have joyed at feast and when the Soma flowed.  \n30 May the Bright God drink glorious Soma-mingled mead,  \ngiving the sacrifice's lord uninjured life;  \nHe who, wind-urged, in person guard our offspring well,  \nhath nourished them with food and shone o\xc2\x92er many a  \nland.  \n31 His bright rays bear him up aloft, the God who knoweth all  \nthat lives,  \nSurya, that all may look on him.  \n32 Pure Varuna, with that same eye wherewith thou lookest  \nupon one  \nActively stirring mid the folk\xc2\x97  \n33 Ye two divine Adhvaryus, come hither upon a sun-bright car:  \nBedew our sacrifice with stead.  \nThou in the first old time. See, Vena. The brilliant presence.  \n34 Loved of all men, may Savitar through praises offered as  \nsacred food come to our synod,  \nThat ye too, through our hymns, ye ever youthful, may  \ngladden at your visit all our people.\n\np. 272\n\n35 Whatever, Vritra-slayer! thou Surya hast risen on to-day,  \nThat, Indra, all is in thy power.  \n36 Swift, visible to all art thou, O Surya, maker of the light,  \nIlluming all the radiant realm.  \n37 This is the Godhead, this the might of Surya: he hath  \nwithdrawn what spread o\xc2\x92er work unfinished.  \nWhen he hath loosed his horses from their station, straight  \nover all Night spreadeth out her garment.  \n38 In the sky's lap the Sun this form assumeth that Varuna  \nand Mitra may behold it.  \nHis Bay Steeds well maintain their power eternal, at one  \ntime bright, and darksome at another.  \n39 Verily, Surya, thou art great; truly, \xc3\x82ditya, thou art great.  \nAs thou art great indeed thy greatness is admired: yea,  \nverily thou, God, art great.  \n40 Yea, Surya, thou art great in fame: thou, evermore, O God,  \nart great.  \nThou by thy greatness art the Gods\xc2\x92 Home-Priest, divine,  \nfar-spread, unconquerable light.  \n41 Turning, as \xc2\x92twere, to meet the Sun, enjoy from Indra all  \ngood things.  \nWhen he who will be horn is born with power we look to  \ntreasures as our heritage.  \n42 To-day, ye Gods, when Surya hath ascended, deliver us  \nfront trouble and dishonour.  \nThis boon may Varuna and Mitra grant us, and Aditi and  \nSindhu, Earth and Heaven.\n\np. 273\n\n43 Throughout the dusky firmament advancing, laying to rest  \nthe immortal and the mortal,  \nBorne on his golden chariot he cometh, Savitar, God,  \nbeholding living creatures.  \n44 Soft to the tread the sacred grass is scattered: these go  \nlike Kings amid the band around them,  \nAt the folk's early call on Night and Morning,\xc2\x97Vayu, and  \nPushan with his team to bless us.  \n45 Indra, Vayu, Brihaspati, Mitra, Agni, Pushan, Bhaga,  \n\xc3\x82dityas, and the Marut host.  \n46 Be Varuna our chief defence, let Mitra guard us with all aids:  \nBoth make us rich exceedingly!  \n47 Regard us, Indra, Vishnu, here, ye Asvins, and the Marut  \nhost, us who are kith and kin to you.  \nThou in the first old time. See, Vena. O ye eleven Gods.  \nLoved of all men, may Savitar. With the All-Gods. Ye  \nVisvedevas who protect.  \n48 O Agni, Indra, Varuna, and Mitra, give, O ye Gods, and  \nMarut host, and Vishnu.  \nMay both Nasatyas, Rudra, heavenly Matrons, Pushan,  \nSarasvati, Bhaga accept us.  \n49 Indra, Agni, Mitra, Varuna, Aditi, the Waters, Mountains,  \nMaruts, Sky, and Earth and Heaven,  \nVishnu I call, Pushan and Brahmanaspati, and Bhaga, Samsa,  \nSavitar that they may help.  \n50 With us are raining Rudras, clouds accordant in call to  \nbattle at the death of Vritra,  \nThe strong, assigned to him who sings and praises. May  \nGods with Indra as their chief protect us.\n\np. 274\n\n51 Turn yourselves hitherward this day, ye Holy, that fearing  \nin my heart I may approach you.  \nProtect us, Gods, let not the wolf destroy us. Save us, ye  \nHoly, from the pit and falling.  \n52 This day come all the Maruts, etc., as in XVIII. 31.  \n53 Listen, All-Gods, to this mine invocation, ye who inhabit  \nheaven and air's mid-region.  \nAll ye; O Holy Ones, whose tongue is Agni, seated upon  \nthis sacred grass be joyful.  \n54 For thou at first producest for the holy Gods the noblest of  \nall portions, immortality.  \nThereafter as a gift to men, O Savitar, thou openest existence,  \nlife succeeding life.  \n55 I with a lofty song call hither Vayu all-bounteous, filler of  \nhis car, most wealthy.  \nThou, Sage, with bright path, Lord of harnessed horses,  \nimpetuous, promptly honourest the prudent.  \n56 These, Indra-Vayu, have been shed, etc., as in VII. 8.  \n57 Mitra of holy strength I call, and foe-destroying Varuna,  \nWho make the oil-fed rite complete.  \n58 Nasatyas, Wonder-workers, yours are these libations with  \nclipt grass.  \nCome ye whose paths are bright with glow.  \n59 When Sarama had, found the mountain's fissure, that vast  \nand ancient place she plundered [thoroughly](errata.htm#17).  \nIn the floods\xc2\x92 van she led them forth, light-footed: she who  \nwell knew came first unto their lowing.\n\np. 275\n\n60 For nowhere did they find another envoy to lead the way  \nthan this Vaisvanara Agni.  \nThe Gods immortal strengthened the immortal Vaisvanara  \nto win the land in battle.  \n61 The strong, dispellers of the foe, Indra and Agni, we invoke:  \nMay they be kind to one like me.  \n62 Sing forth to Indu, O ye men, to him as he is purified,  \nFain to pay worship to the Gods.  \n63 Drink Soma, Indra, handed with the Maruts who, Boon  \nLord! strengthened thee at Ahi's slaughter,  \n\xc2\x92Gainst Sambara, Lord of Bays! in winning cattle, and now  \nrejoice in thee, the holy singers.  \n64 Thou vast born mighty for victorious valour, exulting,  \nstrongest, full of pride and courage.  \nThere, even there the Maruts strengthened Indra when his  \nmost rapid Mother stirred the Hero.  \n65 O thou who slewest Vritra, come, O Indra, hither to our side,  \nMighty One with thy mighty aids.  \n66 Thou in thy battles, Indra, art subduer of all hostile bands.  \nFather art thou, all-conquering, cancelling the curse: vanquish  \nthe men who fight with us.  \n67 Heaven and Earth cling close to thy victorious might  \nAs sire and mother to their child.  \n68 The sacrifice obtains the Gods\xc2\x92 acceptance, etc., as in VIII. 4.  \n69 Protect our habitation, Savitar, this day with guardian  \naids around, propitious, ne\xc2\x92er beguiled.  \nGod of the golden tongue, keep us for newest bliss: let not  \nthe evil-wisher have us in his power.\n\np. 276\n\n70 For you have flowed, through noble ministration, pressed  \nby Adhvaryus, bright sweet-flavoured juices.  \nDrive on thy team and come thou hither, Vayu: drink for  \nthy rapture of the sap of Soma.  \n71 Ye Cows, protect, etc., as in verse 14.  \n72 Come ye foe-slayers to the place of meeting, to the  \nbirth-places of the two great Sages,  \nWith force of intellect unto the dwelling.  \n73 Ye two divine Adhvaryus, etc., as in verse 33.
