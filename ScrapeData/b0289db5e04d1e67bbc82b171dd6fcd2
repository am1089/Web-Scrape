Non-return, according to Scripture; non-return, according to Scripture.\n\nWe know from Scripture that there is a Supreme Person whose nature is absolute\nbliss and goodness; who is fundamentally antagonistic to all evil; who is the\ncause of the origination, sustentation, and dissolution of the world; who\ndiffers in nature from all other beings, who is all-knowing, who by his mere\nthought and will accomplishes all his purposes; who is an ocean of kindness as\nit were for all who depend on him; who is all-merciful; who is immeasurably\nraised above all possibility of any one being equal or superior to him; whose\nname is the _highest Brahman_. And with equal certainty we know from Scripture\nthat this Supreme Lord, when pleased by the faithful worship of his Devotees--\nwhich worship consists in daily repeated meditation on Him, assisted by the\nperformance of all the practices prescribed for each caste and a _s_ rama--\nfrees them from the influence of Nescience which consists of karman\naccumulated in the infinite progress of time and hence hard to overcome;\nallows them to attain to that supreme bliss which consists in the direct\nintuition of His own true nature: and after that does not turn them back into\nthe miseries of Sa _m_ sara. The text distinctly teaching this is 'He who\nbehaves thus all his life through reaches the world of Brahman and does not\nreturn' ( _Kh_. Up. VIII, 15). And the Lord himself declares 'Having obtained\nme great-souled men do not come into rebirth, the fleeting abode of misery;\nfor they have\n\np. 771\n\nreached the highest perfection. Up to the world of Brahma the worlds return\nagain, O Ar _g_ una; but having attained to me, O son of Kunti, there is no\nrebirth' (Bha. Gi. VIII, 1, 5-16). As, moreover, the released soul has freed\nitself from the bondage of karman, has its powers of knowledge fully\ndeveloped, and has all its being in the supremely blissful intuition of the\nhighest Brahman, it evidently cannot desire anything else nor enter on any\nother form of activity, and the idea of its returning into the Sa _m_ sara\ntherefore is altogether excluded. Nor indeed need we fear that the Supreme\nLord when once having taken to himself the Devotee whom he greatly loves will\nturn him back into the Sa _m_ sara. For He himself has said, 'To the wise man\nI am very dear, and dear he is to me. Noble indeed are all these, but the wise\nman I regard as my very Self. For he, with soul devoted, seeks me only as his\nhighest goal. At the end of many births the wise man goes to me, thinking all\nis Vasudeva. Such great-souled men are rarely met with' (Bha. Gi. VII, 17-19).\n--The repetition of the words of the Sutra indicates the conclusion of this\nbody of doctrine. Thus everything is settled to satisfaction.--Here terminates\nthe adhikara _n_ a of 'with the exception of the world-energies.'\n\nHere terminates the fourth pada of the fourth adhyaya of the commentary on the\n_S_ ariraka Mima _m_ sa, composed by the reverend teacher Ramanu _g_ a. This\ncompletes the fourth adhyaya, and the whole work; and the entire body of\ndoctrine is thus brought to a conclusion.\n\np. 773\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Index of Sanskrit Words](sbe48574.htm)\n\n"
