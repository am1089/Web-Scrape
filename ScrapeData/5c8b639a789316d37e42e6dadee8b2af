Yet they contain the essence of\npractical wisdom, set forth in admirable order and detail. The theme, if the\npresent interpreter be right, is the great regeneration, the birth of the\nspiritual from the psychical man: the same theme which Paul so wisely and\neloquently set forth in writing to his disciples in Corinth, the theme of all\nmystics in all lands.\n\nWe think of ourselves as living a purely physical life, in these material\nbodies of ours. In reality, we have gone far indeed from pure physical life;\nfor ages, our life has been psychical, we have been centred and immersed in\nthe psychic nature. Some of the schools of India say that the psychic nature\nis, as it were, a looking-glass, wherein are mirrored the things seen by the\nphysical eyes, and heard by the physical ears. But this is a magic mirror; the\nimages remain, and take a certain life of their own. Thus within the psychic\nrealm of our life there grows up an imaged world wherein we dwell; a world of\nthe images of things seen and heard, and therefore a world of memories; a\nworld also of hopes and desires, of fears and regrets. Mental life grows up\namong these images, built on a measuring and comparing, on the massing of\nimages together into general ideas; on the abstraction of new notions and\nimages from these; till a new world is built up within, full of desires and\nhates, ambition, envy, longing, speculation, curiosity, self-will, self-\ninterest.\n\nThe teaching of the East is, that all these are true powers overlaid by false\ndesires; that though in manifestation psychical, they are in essence\nspiritual; that the psychical man is the veil and prophecy of the spiritual\nman.\n\nThe purpose of life, therefore, is the realizing of that prophecy; the\nunveiling of the immortal man; the birth of the spiritual from the psychical,\nwhereby we enter our divine inheritance and come to inhabit Eternity. This is,\nindeed, salvation, the purpose of all true religion, in all times.\n\nPatanjali has in mind the spiritual man, to be born from the psychical. His\npurpose is, to set in order the practical means for the unveiling and\nregeneration, and to indicate the fruit, the glory and the power, of that new\nbirth.\n\nThrough the Sutras of the first book, Patanjali is concerned with the first\ngreat problem, the emergence of the spiritual man from the veils and meshes of\nthe psychic nature, the moods and vestures of the mental and emotional man.\nLater will come the consideration of the nature and powers of the spiritual\nman, once he stands clear of the psychic veils and trammels, and a view of the\nrealms in which these new spiritual powers are to be revealed.\n\nAt this point may come a word of explanation. I have been asked why I use the\nword Sutras, for these rules of Patanjali's system, when the word Aphorism has\nbeen connected with them in our minds for a generation. The reason is this:\nthe name Aphorism suggests, to me at least, a pithy sentence of very general\napplication; a piece of proverbial wisdom that may be quoted in a good many\nsets of circumstance, and which will almost bear on its face the evidence of\nits truth. But with a Sutra the case is different. It comes from the same root\nas the word 'sew,' and means, indeed, a thread, suggesting, therefore, a close\nknit, consecutive chain of argument. Not only has each Sutra a definite place\nin the system, but further, taken out of this place, it will be almost\nmeaningless, and will by no means be self-evident. So I have thought best to\nadhere to the original word. The Sutras of Patanjali are as closely knit\ntogether, as dependent on each other, as the propositions of Euclid, and can\nno more be taken out of their proper setting.\n\nIn the second part of the first book, the problem of the emergence of the\nspiritual man is further dealt with. We are led to the consideration of the\nbarriers to his emergence, of the overcoming of the barriers, and of certain\nsteps and stages in the ascent from the ordinary consciousness of practical\nlife, to the finer, deeper, radiant consciousness of the spiritual man.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book I](ysp02.htm)\n\n"
