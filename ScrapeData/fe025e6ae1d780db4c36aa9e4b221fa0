It should be remembered that Spenser tells us of "two\nbrethren giants" "The one of which had two heads, the other three;" and Milton\nspeaks of the "four-fold visaged Four," the four Cherubic shapes each of which\nhad four faces.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto L.: Prahasta\'s Questions.](ry388.htm)\n\n'
