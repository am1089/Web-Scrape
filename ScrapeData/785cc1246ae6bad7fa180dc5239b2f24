It had not been my husband\'s\nhabit to speak cuttingly, but latterly there has been a change and he never\nspares Sandip.\n\n"What makes you suppose that artists need no teachers?" Sandip retorted.\n\n"Art is a creation," my husband replied. "So we should humbly be content to\nreceive our lessons about Art from the work of the artist."\n\nSandip laughed at this modesty, saying: "You think that meekness is a kind of\ncapital which increases your wealth the more you use it. It is my conviction\nthat those who lack pride only float about like water reeds which have no\nroots in the soil."\n\nMy mind used to be full of contradictions when they talked thus. On the one\nhand I was eager that my husband should win in argument and that Sandip\'s\npride should be shamed. Yet, on the other, it was Sandip\'s unabashed pride\nwhich attracted me so. It shone like a precious diamond, which knows no\ndiffidence, and sparkles in the face of the sun itself.\n\nI entered the room. I knew Sandip could hear my footsteps as I went forward,\nbut he pretended not to, and kept his eyes on the book.\n\nI dreaded his Art talks, for I could not overcome my delicacy about the\npictures he talked of, and the things he said, and had much ado in putting on\nan air of overdone insensibility to hide my qualms. So, I was almost on the\npoint of retracing my steps, when, with a deep sigh, Sandip raised his eyes,\nand affected to be startled at the sight of me. "Ah, you have come!" he said.\n\nIn his words, in his tone, in his eyes, there was a world of suppressed\nreproach, as if the claims he had acquired over me made my absence, even for\nthese two or three days, a grievous wrong. I knew this attitude was an insult\nto me, but, alas, I had not the power to resent it.\n\nI made no reply, but though I was looking another way, I could not help\nfeeling that Sandip\'s plaintive gaze had planted itself right on my face, and\nwould take no denial. I did so wish he would say something, so that I could\nshelter myself behind his words. I cannot tell how long this went on, but at\nlast I could stand it no longer. "What is this matter," I asked, "you are\nwanting to tell me about?"\n\nSandip again affected surprise as he said: "Must there always be some matter?\nIs friendship by itself a crime? Oh, Queen Bee, to think that you should make\nso light of the greatest thing on earth! Is the heart\'s worship to be shut out\nlike a stray cur?"\n\nThere was again that tremor within me. I could feel the crisis coming, too\nimportunate to be put off. Joy and fear struggled for the mastery. Would my\nshoulders, I wondered, be broad enough to stand its shock, or would it not\nleave me overthrown, with my face in the dust?\n\nI was trembling all over. Steadying myself with an effort I repeated: "You\nsummoned me for something touching the Cause, so I have left my household\nduties to attend to it."\n\n"That is just what I was trying to explain," he said, with a dry laugh. "Do\nyou not know that I come to worship? Have I not told you that, in you, I\nvisualize the _Shakti_ of our country? The Geography of a country is not the\nwhole truth. No one can give up his life for a map! When I see you before me,\nthen only do I realize how lovely my country is. When you have anointed me\nwith your own hands, then shall I know I have the sanction of my country; and\nif, with that in my heart, I fall fighting, it shall not be on the dust of\nsome map-made land, but on a lovingly spread skirt--do you know what kind of\nskirt?--like that of the earthen-red _sari_ you wore the other day, with a\nbroad blood-red border. Can I ever forget it? Such are the visions which give\nvigour to life, and joy to death!"\n\nSandip\'s eyes took fire as he went on, but whether it was the fire of worship,\nor of passion, I could not tell. I was reminded of the day on which I first\nheard him speak, when I could not be sure whether he was a person, or just a\nliving flame.\n\nI had not the power to utter a word. You cannot take shelter behind the walls\nof decorum when in a moment the fire leaps up and, with the flash of its sword\nand the roar of its laughter, destroys all the miser\'s stores. I was in terror\nlest he should forget himself and take me by the hand. For he shook like a\nquivering tongue of fire; his eyes showered scorching sparks on me.\n\n"Are you for ever determined," he cried after a pause, "to make gods of your\npetty household duties--you who have it in you to send us to life or to death?\nIs this power of yours to be kept veiled in a zenana? Cast away all false\nshame, I pray you; snap your fingers at the whispering around. Take your\nplunge today into the freedom of the outer world."\n\nWhen, in Sandip\'s appeals, his worship of the country gets to be subtly\ninterwoven with his worship of me, then does my blood dance, indeed, and the\nbarriers of my hesitation totter. His talks about Art and Sex, his\ndistinctions between Real and Unreal, had but clogged my attempts at response\nwith some revolting nastiness. This, however, now burst again into a glow\nbefore which my repugnance faded away. I felt that my resplendent womanhood\nmade me indeed a goddess. Why should not its glory flash from my forehead with\nvisible brilliance? Why does not my voice find a word, some audible cry, which\nwould be like a sacred spell to my country for its fire initiation?\n\nAll of a sudden my maid Khema rushed into the room, dishevelled. "Give me my\nwages and let me go," she screamed. "Never in all my life have I been so ..."\nThe rest of her speech was drowned in sobs.\n\n"What is the matter?"\n\nThako, the Bara Rani\'s maid, it appeared, had for no rhyme or reason reviled\nher in unmeasured terms. She was in such a state, it was no manner of use\ntrying to pacify her by saying I would look into the matter afterwards.\n\nThe slime of domestic life that lay beneath the lotus bank of womanhood came\nto the surface. Rather than allow Sandip a prolonged vision of it, I had to\nhurry back within.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X](hw16.htm)\n\n'
