And (he chants) the Savitri with its Saman melody,\n\np. 78\n\n4\\. And (the Barhaspatya Saman, with the text), 'Soma, the king, Varu _n_ a'\n(Sama-veda I, 91).\n\n5. 5 After they have recited (the first verses) of the _Kh_ andas book, from its beginning, they may do what they like.\n\n6. 6 They eat fried barley-grains with (the verse), 'That which is accompanied by grains and by a karambha (i.e. curds with flour)' (Sama-veda I, 2 10).\n\n7\\. They partake of curds with (the verse), 'I have praised Dadhikravan'\n(Sama-veda I, 358).\n\n8. 8 After they have sipped water, (the teacher) should cause them to repeat the first (?) verses, and to sing the first (?) Samans, of the different sections (?).\n\n9. 9 On the day sacred to Savit _ri_ they wait.\n\n10. 10 And at (the beginning of) the northerly\n\np. 79\n\ncourse of the sun (they wait) one night with one day before and one day after\nit,\n\n11\\. (Or they interrupt their study for) a period of three nights before and\nafterwards, according to some (teachers).\n\n12. 12 And both times water libations are offered to the \xc3\x82 _k_ aryas.\n\n13. 13 Some perform the Upakara _n_ a on the full-moon day of _S_ rava _n_ a and wait (with studying) the time (from that day) till the day sacred to Savit _ri_ (Sutra 9).\n\n14. 14 On the full-moon day of Taisha they leave off (studying the Veda).\n\n15. 15 They should go out of the village in an easterly or northerly direction, should go to water which reaches higher than to their secret parts, should touch water (in the way prescribed above, I, 2), and should satiate the metres, the _Ri_ shis, and teachers (by libations of water).\n\n16. 16 After this second Upakara _n_ a, until the (chief) Upakara _n_ a (has been performed) again for the Vedic texts, an interruption of the study (of the Veda takes place), if clouds rise.\n\np. 80\n\n17\\. If lightning (is observed), or if it thunders, or if it is drizzling, (he\nshall not study) until the same time next day.\n\n18. 18 On the falling of a meteor, or after an earthquake, or an eclipse of the sun or of the moon (the study is interrupted until the same time next day),\n\n19\\. And if a whirlwind occurs.\n\n20\\. Let them not study on the Ash _t_ aka days, and on the days of the new\nmoon,\n\n21\\. And on the days of the full moon\xc2\x97\n\n22. 22 In the three months Karttika, Phalguna, and \xc3\x82sha _dh_ a.\n\n23\\. And (the study is interrupted) for one day and one night,\n\n24\\. If a fellow-pupil has died,\n\n25\\. Or the sovereign of his country;\n\n26\\. Three days, if his teacher (has died);\n\n27\\. One day and one night, if somebody (has died) who has reverentially\napproached.\n\n28\\. If singing, or the sound of a musical instrument, or weeping is heard, or\nif it is storming, (the\n\np. 81\n\nstudy of the Veda is discontinued) as long as that (reason of the\ninterruption) lasts.\n\n29. 29 As regards other (cases in which the reading of the Veda should ne discontinued), the practice of the _S_ ish _t_ as (should be followed).\n\n30. 30 In the case of a prodigy an expiation (has to be performed) by the householder (or) by his wife.\n\n31\\. If a spar of the roof or the middle (post of the house) breaks, or if the\nwater-barrel bursts, let him sacrifice (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations) with the Vyah _ri_\ntis.\n\n32\\. If he has seen bad dreams, let him murmur this verse, 'To-day, O god\nSavit _ri_ ' (Sama-veda I, 141).\n\n33\\. Now (follows) another (expiation).\n\n34. 34 If he has touched a piled-up (fire-altar) or a sacrificial post, or if he has humming in his ears, or if his eye palpitates, or if the sun rises or sets while he is sleeping, or if his organs of sense have been defiled by something bad, let him sacrifice two \xc3\x82 _g_ ya oblations with the two verses, 'May my strength return to me' (Mantra-Brahma _n_ a I, 6, 33. 34).\n\n35\\. Or (let him sacrifice) two pieces of wood anointed with \xc3\x82 _g_ ya.\n\n36\\. Or let him murmur (those two verses) at light offences.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[77:1](sbe30025.htm#fr_283) 3, 1 seq. The Upakara _n_ a ceremony; Khadira-G\n_ri_ hya III, 2, 16 seq. Regarding the different terms for this ceremony,\ncomp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana IV, 5, 2; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana III, 5, 3; Paraskara II, 10, 2.\nHira _n_ yake _s_ in says: _s_ rava _n_ apaksha oshadhishu _g_ atasu hastena\npaur _n_ amasya _m_ vadhyayopakarma.\xc2\x97It seems impossible to me to adopt an\nexplanation of this Sutra, which gives to praush _th_ apadi another meaning\nthan that based on the constant use of these feminines derived from the names\nof Nakshatras, i.e. the day of the full moon which falls under such or such a\nNakshatra. Hasten a, therefore, necessarily refers to another day besides the\nPraush _th_ apadi, on which the Upakara _n_ a may be celebrated. Perhaps we\nmay conjecture, praush _th_ apadi _m_ hastena vopakara _n_ am.\n\n[77:2](sbe30025.htm#fr_284) Comp. above, II, 10, 39.\n\n[78:5](sbe30025.htm#fr_285) The _Kh_ andas book is the first Samavedar _k_ ika\nin which the verses are arranged according to their metre.\n\n[78:6](sbe30025.htm#fr_286) It is not quite clear from the text, in what\nconnection the rites described in Sutras 6-8 stand with those treated of in\nthe preceding Sutras. The expression yathartham used in Sutra 5 ('yathartham\niti karma _n_ a _h_ parisamaptir u _k_ yate,' Comm.; comp. above, I, 3, 12\nnote) clearly indicates the close of the ceremony; on the other hand the\ncomparison of Paraskara II, 10, 15 seq., _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana IV, 5, 10 seq., \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana III, 5, 10, seems to show that the acts stated in Sutras 6-8 form\npart of the ceremony described before.\n\n[78:8](sbe30025.htm#fr_287) I do not try to translate this very obscure Sutra\naccording to the commentary, in which kha _n_ _d_ ika is explained as 'the\nnumber (of pupils).' Perhaps the word is a misspelling for ka _n_ _d_ ika or\nthe like, and means sections of the texts. Comp. Khadira-G _ri_ hya III, 2,\n23. The construction (a _k_ antodaka _h_ . . . karayet) is quite irregular.\n\n[78:9](sbe30025.htm#fr_288) I.e. they do not continue their study. The day\nsacred to Savit _ri_ is the day under the constellation of Hasta, mentioned in\nSutra 1, for Savit _ri_ is the presiding deity over that Nakshatra (comp. _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana I, 26, 11).\n\n[78:10](sbe30025.htm#fr_289) Comp. the note on Sutra 16.\n\n[79:12](sbe30025.htm#fr_290) Regarding the Tarpa _n_ a ceremony comp. _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85khayana 1V, 9, s note. From the word 'and' the commentator concludes that\nthe libations are offered not only to the \xc3\x82 _k_ aryas, but also to the _Ri_\nshis, &c. (Sutra 15).\n\n[79:13](sbe30025.htm#fr_291) Comp. Gautama XVI, 1; Vasish _th_ a XIII, 1;\n\xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 1, &c.\n\n[79:14](sbe30025.htm#fr_292) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 9, 2, &c.\n\n[79:15](sbe30025.htm#fr_293) This is a description of the Utsarga ceremony;\ncomp. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85khayana IV, 6, 6; \xc3\x82 _s_ valayana III, 5, 21-23; Paraskara II, 12.\n\n[79:16](sbe30025.htm#fr_294) The most natural way of interpreting the text\nwould be, in my opinion, to assume that the 'second Upakara _n_ a'\n(pratyupakara _n_ a) is identical with the Utsarga. The second Upakara _n_ a\nthus would in the same time conclude the first term for studying the p. 80\nVeda, and open a second term. The distinction of two such periods, which may\nbe called two terms, is frequently met with in other texts, for instance, in\nVasish _th_ a XIII, 5-7 (S.B.E. XIV, 63); Manu IV, 98. According to the\ncommentary, on the other hand, the second Upakara _n_ a is performed at the\nbeginning of the northerly course of the sun (comp. Sutras 10-12); it is\nstated that after that ceremony the Uttara (i.e. the Uttarar _k_ ika?) and the\nRahasya texts are studied. It deserves to be noticed that Manu (IV, 96)\nprescribes the performing of the Utsarga either under the Nakshatra Pushya\n(i.e. Tishya), or on the first day of the bright fortnight of Magha, which is\nconsidered as coinciding, at least approximately, with the beginning of the\nnortherly course of the sun.\n\n[80:18](sbe30025.htm#fr_295) Comp. Manu IV, 105.\n\n[80:22](sbe30025.htm#fr_296) These are the days of the ancient Vedic _k_\naturmasya sacrifices.\n\n[81:29](sbe30025.htm#fr_297) The definition of a _S_ ish _t_ a, or instructed\nperson, is given in Baudhayana I, 1, 6 (S.B.E. XIV, 143).\n\n[81:30](sbe30025.htm#fr_298) 30-36. Different expiations; comp. Khadira-G _ri_\nhya II, 5, 35-37.\n\n[81:34](sbe30025.htm#fr_299) _K_ itya means _K_ itya agni, the piled-up fire-\naltar, the construction of which is treated of, for instance, in the _S_\natapatha Brahma _n_ a VI-X. Prof. Weber has devoted to the rites connected\nwith the _k_ itya agni a very detailed paper, Indische Studien, XIII, 217 seq.\nThat _k_ itya does not mean here anything different from _k_ itya agni is\nshown by the Manava-G _ri_ hya I, 3: yadi . . . akshi va spandet kar _n_ o va\nkro _s_ ed agni _m_ va _k_ ityam arohet _s_ ma _s_ ana _m_ va ga _k_ _kh_ ed\nyupa _m_ vopasp _ri_ _s_ et, &c.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 4](sbe30026.htm)\n\n"
