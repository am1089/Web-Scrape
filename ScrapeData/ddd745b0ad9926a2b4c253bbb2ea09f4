As to this they say, 'What are the vital airs (pra _n_ a), and what\nthe Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ta _h_?'--The vital airs are just the vital airs, and the\nPra _n_ abh _ri_ ta _h_ (holders of the vital airs) are the limbs, for the\nlimbs do hold the vital airs. But, indeed, the vital airs are the vital airs,\nand the Pra _n_ abh _ri_ t is food, for food does uphold the vital airs.\n\n8:1:3:22\\. As to this they say, 'How do all these (Pra _n_ abh _ri_ t-bricks)\nof him (Agni and the Sacrificer) come to be of Pra _g_ apati's nature?'--\nDoubtless in that with all of them he says, 'By thee, taken by Pra _g_ apati:'\nit is in this way, indeed, that they all come to be for him of Pra _g_ apati's\nnature 1.\n\n8:1:3:33\\. As to this they say, 'As they chant and recite for the cup when\ndrawn, wherefore, then, does he put in verses and hymn-tunes 2 before (the\ndrawing of) the cups?'--Doubtless, the completion of the sacrificial work has\nto be kept in view;--now with the opening hymn-verse the cup is drawn; and on\nthe verse ( _ri_ _k_ ) the tune (saman) is sung: this means that he thereby\nputs in for him (Agni) both the verses and hymn-tunes before (the drawing of)\nthe cups. And when after (the drawing of) the cups there are the chanting (of\nthe Stotra) and the recitation (of the _S_ astra): this means that thereby he\nputs in for him both the stomas (hymn-forms) and the p _ri_ sh _th_ a (samans)\nafter (the drawing of) the cups 3.\n\np. 14\n\n8:1:3:44\\. As to this they say, 'If these three are done together--the soma-\ncup, the chant, and the recitation,--and he puts in only the soma-cup and the\nchant, how comes the recitation also in this case to be put (into the\nsacrificial work) for him 1?' But, surely, what the chant is that is the\nrecitation 2; for on whatsoever (verses) they chant a tune, those same\n(verses) he (the Hot _ri_ ) recites thereafter 3; and in this way, indeed, the\n_S_ astra also comes in this case to be put in for him.\n\n8:1:3:55\\. As to this they say, 'When he speaks first of three in the same way\nas of a father's son 4, how, then, does this correspond as regards the _ri_ le\nand saman?' The saman, doubtless, is the husband of the\n\np. 15\n\n[paragraph continues] _Ri_ _k_ ; and hence were he also in their case to speak\nas of a father's son, it would be as if he spoke of him who is the husband, as\nof the son: therefore it corresponds as regards the _ri_ _k_ and saman. 'And\nwhy does he thrice carry on (the generation from father to son)?'--father,\nson, and grandson: it is these he thereby carries on; and therefore one and\nthe same (man) offers (food) to them 1.\n\n8:1:3:66\\. Those (bricks) which he lays down in front are the holders of the\nupward air (the breath, pra _n_ a); those behind are the eye-holders, the\nholders of the downward air (apana) 2; those on the right side are the mind-\nholders, the holders of the circulating air (vyana); those on the left side\nare the ear-holders, the holders of the outward air (udana); and those in the\nmiddle are the speech-holders, the holders of the pervading air (samana).\n\n8:1:3:77\\. Now the _K_ arakadhvaryus, indeed, lay down different (bricks) as\nholders of the downward air, of the circulating air, of the outward air, of\nthe pervading air, as eye-holders, mind-holders, ear-holders, and speech-\nholders; but let him not do this, for they do what is excessive, and in this\n(our) way, indeed, all those forms are laid (into Agni).\n\n8:1:3:88\\. Now, when he has laid down (the bricks) in\n\np. 16\n\nfront, he lays down those at the back (of the altar); for the upward air,\nbecoming the downward air, passes along thus from the tips of the fingers; and\nthe downward air, becoming the upward air, passes along thus from the tips of\nthe toes: hence when, after laying down (the bricks) in front, he lays down\nthose at the back, he thereby makes these two breathings continuous and\nconnects them; whence these two breathings are continuous and connected.\n\n8:1:3:99\\. And when he has laid down those on the right side, he lays down\nthose on the left side; for the outward air, becoming the circulating air,\npasses along thus from the tips of the fingers 1; and the circulating air,\nbecoming the outward air, passes along thus from the tips of the fingers 1:\nhence when, after laying down (the bricks) on the right side, he lays down\nthose on the left side, he thereby makes these two breathings continuous and\nconnects them; whence these two breathings are continuous and connected.\n\n8:1:3:1010\\. And those (bricks) which he lays down in the centre are the vital\nair; he lays them down on the range of the two Reta _h_ si _k_ (bricks), for\nthe reta _h_ si _k_ are the ribs, and the ribs are the middle: he thus lays\nthe vital air into him (Agni and the Sacrificer) in the very middle (of the\nbody). On every side he lays down (the central bricks) 2: in every part he\nthus\n\np. 17\n\nlays vital air into him; and in the same way indeed that intestinal breath\n(channel) is turned all round\n\np. 18\n\nthe navel. He lays them down both lengthwise and crosswise 1, whence there are\nhere in the body (channels of) the vital airs both lengthwise and crosswise.\nHe lays them down touching each other: he thereby makes these vital airs\ncontinuous and connects them; whence these (channels of the) vital airs are\ncontinuous and connected.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[13:1](sbe4305.htm#fr_55) Or, come to be (Agni-) Pra _g_ apati's (pra _g_\napatya bhavanti).\n\n[13:2](sbe4305.htm#fr_56) In laying down the different sets of Pra _n_ abh\n_ri_ t-bricks the priest is said (in [VIII, 1, 1, 5](sbe4303.htm#8:1:1:5); 8;\n2, 2; 5; 8) symbolically to put into the sacrificial work (or into the altar,\nAgni) 'both verses or metres (as Gayatri, Trish _t_ ubh, &c.) and hymn-tunes\n(as Gayatra. Svara, &c.).\n\n[13:3](sbe4305.htm#fr_57) It is not quite clear whether this is the correct\nconstruction of p. 14  the text, especially as, in the paragraph referred to\nin. the last note, it is not only the metres and tunes that are supposed to be\nput in along with the Pra _n_ abh _ri_ ta _h_ , but also the stomas and p _ri_\nsh _th_ a-samans.\n\n[14:1](sbe4305.htm#fr_58) Only soma-cups (graha) and hymn-tunes (saman) and\nhymn-forms (stoma) are specially named in connection with these bricks, but no\n_s_ astras.\n\n[14:2](sbe4305.htm#fr_59) Every stotra, chanted by the Udgat _ri_ s, is\nfollowed by a _s_ astra recited by the Hot _ri_ or one of his assistants.\n\n[14:3](sbe4305.htm#fr_60) Most chants (stotra) consisting of a single triplet\n(e. g. the P _ri_ sh _th_ a-stotras at the midday service) have their text\n(stotriyat _ri_ _k_ a) included in the corresponding _s_ astra recited by the\nHot _ri_ , or one of the Hotrakas; it being followed, on its part, by the\nrecitation of an analogous triplet (anurupa, 'similar or corresponding,' i.e.\nantistrophe) usually commencing with the very same word, or words, as the\nstotriya.\n\n[14:4](sbe4305.htm#fr_61) As in the case of the first (south-west) set of\nbricks, [VIII, 1, 1, 4](sbe4303.htm#8:1:1:4)-[6](sbe4303.htm#8:1:1:6), he puts\ndown the first four with 'This one, in front, the existent,' 'His, the\nexistent's son, the breath,' 'Spring, the son of the breath,' and 'The\nGayatri, the daughter of spring,'--implying three generations from father to\nson (or daughter). In the formulas of the remaining bricks of each set\nreferring to the metres (or verses, ilk) and hymn-tunes (saman) the statement\nof descent is expressed more vaguely by, 'From the Gayatri (is derived) the\nGayatra,' &c.\n\n[15:1](sbe4305.htm#fr_62) At the offerings to the Fathers, or deceased\nancestors, oblations are made to the father, grandfather, and great-\ngrandfather; see II, 4, 2, 23.\n\n[15:2](sbe4305.htm#fr_63) Saya _n_ a, on Taitt. S. IV, 3, 3, explains 'pra _n_\na' by 'bahi _h_ sa _m_ _k_ ararupa,' and 'apana' by 'punaranta _h_ sa _m_\nkararupa;' see also part i, p. 120, note 2; but cp. Maitry-up. II, 6; H.\nWalter, Ha _th_ ayogapradipika, p. xviii. Beside the fifty bricks called 'Pra\n_n_ abh _ri_ ta _h_ ,' the Taittiriyas also place fifty Apanabh _ri_ ta _h_ in\nthe first layer of the altar.\n\n[16:1](sbe4305.htm#fr_65) ? Or, perhaps, the fingers and toes. The same word\n(a\xe1\xb9\x85guli), having both meanings, makes it difficult exactly to understand these\nprocesses. The available MSS. of Harisvamin's commentary unfortunately afford\nno help.\n\n[16:2](sbe4305.htm#fr_66) That is to say, he lays down the fifth set round the\n(central) Svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a, on the range of the two Reta _h_ si _k_\nbricks. It is, p. 17 however, not quite clear in what particular manner this\nfifth set of ten bricks is to be arranged round the centre so as to touch one\nanother. The two Reta _h_ si _k_ bricks, occupying each a space of a square\nfoot north and south of the spine, are separated from the central (Svayamat\n_ri_ _n_ _n_ a) brick by the Dviya _g_ us brick a foot square. The inner side\nof the reta _h_ si _k_ -space would thus be a foot and a half, and their outer\nside two feet and a half, distant from the central point of the altar. The\nreta _h_ si _k_ range, properly speaking, would thus consist of a circular\nrim, obtained by drawing two\n\n![THE CENTRAL PART OF THE FIRST LAYER.](img/01700.jpg)  \nTHE CENTRAL PART OF THE FIRST LAYER.\n\nconcentric circles round the centre, with diameters of one and a half and two\nand a half feet respectively. On this rim (allowing for the corners of the\nbricks jutting out) room would have to be found for twelve bricks of a foot\nsquare, viz. the two reta _h_ si _k_ , already lying on the eastern side,\nsouth and north of the spine, and ten pra _n_ abh _ri_ ts. The way in which\nthese latter were arranged would probably be this: on each of the three other\nsides two bricks were laid down so as to join each other in a line with the\nrespective 'spine,' similarly to the two reta _h_ si _k_ bricks on the east\nside; and the four remaining bricks would then be placed in the four corners--\nthe twelve bricks thus forming, as nearly as could be, a circular rim. In the\nconstruction of the altar, this reta _h_ si _k_ range is determined by a cord\nbeing stretched from. the centre to the east end of the altar, after the\nspecial bricks of the first layer have p. 18 been laid down, knots being then\nmade in the cord over the middle of each of the special bricks. The reta _h_\nsi _k_ range is consequently ascertained, in subsequent layers, by a circle\ndrawn round the centre, with that part of the cord marked by the central and\nthe reta _h_ si _k_ knot for the diameter. The foregoing diagram shows that\nportion of the first layer which contains the continuous row of special bricks\nlaid down first, viz. Svayamat _ri_ _n_ _n_ a, Dviya _g_ us, two Reta _h_ si\n_k_ , Vi _s_ va _g_ yotis, two Ritavya, and Asha _dh_ a; and further the\ncentral (or fifth) set of ten pra _n_ abh _ri_ ta _h_ , placed round the\ncentral brick on the range of the reta _h_ si _k_.\n\n[18:1](sbe4305.htm#fr_67) Each special brick is marked on its upper surface\nwith (usually three) parallel lines. Now the bricks are always laid down in\nsuch a way that their lines run parallel to the adjoining spine, whence those\non the east and west sides have their lines running lengthwise (west to east),\nand those on the north and south sides crosswise (north to south). As to the\nfour corner bricks there is some uncertainty on this point, but if we may\njudge from the analogy of the second layer in this respect, the bricks of the\nsouth-east and north-west corners would be eastward-lined, and those of the\nnortheast and south-west corners northward-lined.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 1, 4.
