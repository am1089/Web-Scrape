Man is man phenomenally, the world is world\nphenomenally, the gods of the world are gods phenomenally, but in full reality\nall are the Godhead, call it \xc3\x82tman or Brahman, metamorphosed and hidden for a\ntime by Avidya or Nescience, but always recoverable by Vidya or by the\nVedanta-philosophy.\n\nThese ideas in a more or less popular form seem to pervade the Hindu mind from\nthe earliest to the latest date. They are taught in the schools, but even\nwithout the schools they seem to be imbibed with the mother's milk. They are\noften exaggerated and caricatured so as to become repulsive to a European\nmind, but in their purity and simplicity they contain an amount of truth which\ncan no longer be safely neglected by any student, whether of philosophy or\nreligion. It can no longer be put aside as merely curious, or disposed of as\nmystic, without a definition of what is meant by mystic, and without an\nargument that everything that is called mystic has really nothing to do with\neither religion or philosophy. That it may lead to dangerous consequences no\none would deny, but the same may be said of almost every religion and every\nphilosophy, if carried to its last consequences. I have already drawn\nattention to the false reasoning, that because good works cannot secure\nsalvation, therefore bad works also are indifferent or harmless. Good works,\naccording to the Vedanta, certainly do not lead straight to salvation, but\n\np. 92\n\nthey represent the first essential step that leads on to salvation, while evil\ndeeds form a barrier that keeps a man from making even the first step in his\nprogress towards knowledge and beatitude. That a Saint cannot sin, or that\n_Sciens non peccat_ , has been held true not in India only, but it is easily\nseen in what sense this is either true or false, whether in India or at home.\nIt cannot be deeply enough impressed on the minds of the modern apostles of\nRamak _ri_ sh _n_ a that nothing would be more likely to lower their master\nand their own work in the eyes of serious people than the slightest moral\nlaxity on their part, or a defence of any such laxity on the ground that a _G_\n_\xc3\xb1_ anin, a Knower, is above morality. It is one thing to say that such a man\ncannot sin because his passions are completely subdued, another that if he\nshould from any defect of knowledge lapse from his passionless and perfect\nstate it could not be imputed to him as sin. I confess there is a little\nuncertainty on that point even among ancient authorities, but we know as yet\nfar too little of the classical Vedantic writings to speak with confidence on\nsuch a point. There are too many passages in which strict morality is enjoined\nas a _sine qua non_ for Vedantic freedom to allow any one to use a few\ndoubtful passages in defence of immorality. When we have first learnt all that\ncan be learnt from the Vedanta, it will be time to begin to criticise it, or,\nif possible, to improve it. We study the systems of Plato and Aristotle, of\nSpinoza and Kant, not as containing the full and perfect truth, cut and dry,\nbut as helping us on towards the truth. Every one of these contains partial\n\np. 93\n\ntruths which might easily be proved to lead to dangerous consequences. What is\nnecessary to us at present, more than at any previous time, is a historical\nstudy of all philosophy, that of India not excluded, in its genetic or\ndialectic development, so that we may not be swayed by every philosophical\nbreeze that announces itself as new, though it has been discussed again and\nagain before, and, it may be, far more thoroughly than by its most recent\nadvocates. It will hereafter sound almost incredible that in our time the\nphilosophical public should have been startled by the idea of evolution as a\nphilosophical novelty, nay, that there should have been an angry contest as to\nwho was really the first discoverer of what has been discussed again and again\nduring the last two thousand years. What is pari _n_ ama, if not evolution,\nthe evolution advocated by Ramanu _g_ a, but rejected by Sa _m_ kara. That the\nillustration of this evolutionary process of the world, as given in our time,\nshould stand incomparably higher than anything attempted from Ramanu _g_ a\ndown to Herder, who would deny? But to the historian of philosophy the idea is\none thing, its illustration of it quite another. It is most unfair to\nrepresent a man like Darwin, who was the most eminent observer of nature, as a\nphilosopher, an abstract philosopher; the very thing which he himself would\nhave most strongly deprecated.\n\nAt present, however, I am not concerned with Indian philosophy, _pure et\nsimple_ , but with its effects on the popular mind of India, as shown by one\nof its recent representatives, Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a. He himself distinguishes\nvery clearly between philosophy or _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana (knowledge) and\n\np. 94\n\ndevotion or Bhakti, and he himself was a Bhakta, a worshipper 1 or lover of\nthe deity, much more than a _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ anin or a knower. It was in order to show\nthe background from which Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a emerges, and the lights and\nshades of the atmosphere in which he moved, that I thought it useful to add a\nshort sketch of Vedantic thought. Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a was in no sense of the\nword an original thinker, the discoverer of a new idea or the propounder of\nany new view of the world. But he saw many things which others had not seen,\nhe recognised the Divine Presence where it was least suspected, he was a poet,\nan enthusiast, or, if you like, a dreamer of dreams. But such dreams also have\na right to exist, and have a claim on our attention and sympathy. Ramak _ri_\nsh _n_ a never composed a philosophical treatise; he simply poured out short\nsayings, and the people came to listen to them, whether the speaker was at the\ntime in full possession of his faculties, or in a dream, or in a trance. From\nall we can learn, it is quite clear that he had, by a powerful control of his\nbreath, and by long continued ascetic exercises, arrived at such a pitch of\nnervous excitability that he could at any moment faint away or fall into a\nstate of unconsciousness, the so-called Samadhi. This Samadhi may be looked\nat, however, from\n\np. 95\n\ntwo points, as either purely physical or as psychical. From an ordinary\nSamadhi a man may recover as one recovers from a fainting fit, but the true\nSamadhi consists in losing oneself or finding oneself entirely in the Supreme\nSpirit. From this Samadhi there is no return, because there is nothing left\nthat can return. A few men only who have reached it, are enabled to return\nfrom it by means of a small remnant of their Ego, and through the efficacy of\ntheir wish to become the instructors and saviours of mankind. Something very\nlike Samadhi is the state of deep dreamless sleep, during which the soul is\nsupposed to be with Brahman for a time, but able to return. This deep,\nunconscious sleep is one of the four states, waking, sleeping with dreams,\nsleeping without dreams, and dying. With Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a it often happened\nthat when he had fallen into this deep sleep, he remained in it so long that\nhis friends were afraid he would never return to consciousness, and so it was\nat last at the time of his death. He had fallen into a trance, and he never\nawoke, but even death could lay hold of his body and his breath only; his\nSelf, no longer his, had recovered its Brahmahood, had become what it had\nalways been and always will be, the \xc3\x82tman, the Highest Self, in all its glory,\nfreed from all the clouds of appearances, and independent of individuality,\npersonality, and of the whole phenomenal world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[94:1](rls23.htm#fr_13) This difference between Bhakti, devotion, and _G_ _\xc3\xb1_\nana, knowledge, is fully treated by Kishori Lal Sarkar in his interesting\nlittle book, The Hindu System of Religious Science and Art, or the Revelations\nof Rationalism and Emotionalism, Calcutta, 1898. ' _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana,' the author\nsays, 'sees with a telescopic, Bhakti with a microscopic eye. _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana\nperceives the essence, Bhakti feels the sweetness. _G_ _\xc3\xb1_ ana discovers the\nSupreme Intelligence, Bhakti reciprocates the Supreme Loving Will.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Sayings of Ramak _ri_ sh _n_ a](rls24.htm)\n\n"
