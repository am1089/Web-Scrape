And as he walked along, the goblin said to him: "O King, I will\ntell you another story. Listen."\n\n\n\nThere is a city called Ayodhya, which was once the capital of Rama the\nexterminator of giants. In this city lived a strong-armed king named Hero-\nbanner who protected the world as a wall protects a city. During his reign a\ngreat merchant named Jewel lived in the city. His wife was named Pleasing, and\na daughter named Pearl was given to her prayers.\n\nAs the girl grew up in her father\'s house, her natural virtues grew too:\nbeauty, charm, and modesty. And thus she became a young woman. Now in her\nyoung womanhood she was asked in marriage not only by great merchants, but\neven by kings. But she was prudent and did not like men. She would not have\nloved a god if he had been her husband. She was ready to die at merely hearing\ntalk of her marriage. So her father was silent on the subject, though his\ntender love for her made him sad. And the story was known everywhere in\nAyodhya.\n\nAt this time all the citizens were being plundered by thieves, and they\npetitioned King Hero-banner in these words: "O King, we are plundered every\nnight by thieves, and cannot catch them. Your Majesty must decide what to do."\nSo the king stationed night-watchmen in hiding about the city, to search out\nthe thieves.\n\nWhen the watchmen failed to catch the thieves for all their searching, the\nking himself took his sword, and wandered about alone at night. And he saw a\nman creeping along a wall with noiseless steps, often casting a fearful glance\nbehind him. The king concluded that this was the thief who all alone robbed\nthe city, and went up to him. And the thief asked him who he was. The king\nreplied: "I am a thief."\n\nThen the thief said joyfully: "Good! You are my friend. Come to my house. I\nwill treat you like a friend." So the king agreed and went with the thief to a\nhouse hidden in a grove and guarded by a wall, full of delightful and\nbeautiful things, and bright with shining gems. There the thief offered the\nking a seat, and went into an inner room.\n\nAt that moment a serving-maid came into the room and said to the king: "Your\nMajesty, why have you come into the jaws of death? This wonderful thief has\ngone out, intending to do you a mischief. He is certainly treacherous. Go away\nquickly."\n\nSo the king quickly went away, returned to the city, and drew up a company of\nsoldiers. With these soldiers he went and surrounded the house where the\nserving-maid had been.\n\nWhen the thief saw that the house was surrounded, he knew that he was\nbetrayed, and came out to fight and die like a man. He showed more than human\nvalour. He cut off the trunks of elephants, the legs of horses, and the heads\nof men; and he was all alone, with only his sword and shield. When the king\nsaw that his army was destroyed, he ran forward himself.\n\nThe king was a scientific swordsman, so with a turn of his wrist he sent the\nsword and the dagger flying from the thief\'s hand. Then he threw away his own\nsword, wrestled with the thief, threw him, and took him alive.\n\nThe next morning the thief was led to the place of execution to be impaled,\nand the drums were beaten. And Pearl, the merchant\'s daughter, saw him from\nher balcony. All bloody and dusty as he was, she went mad with love, found her\nfather, and said to him: "Father, I am going to marry that thief who is being\nled to execution. You must save him from the king. Otherwise I shall die with\nhim."\n\nBut her father said: "What do you mean, my daughter? That thief stole\neverything the citizens had, and the king\'s men are going to kill him. How can\nI save him from the king? Besides, what nonsense are you talking?" But the\nmore he scolded, the more determined she became. And as he loved his daughter,\nhe went to the king and offered all he had for the release of the thief.\n\nBut the king would not be tempted by millions. He would not release the thief\nwho stole everything, whom he had captured at the risk of his life. So the\nfather returned home sadly. And the girl, not heeding the arguments of her\nrelatives, took a bath, entered a litter, and went to the death-scene of the\nrogue, to die with him. Her parents and her relatives followed her, weeping.\n\nAt that moment the executioners impaled the thief. As his life ebbed away, he\nsaw the girl and the people with her, and learned her story. Then the tears\nrolled down his cheeks, but he died with a smile on his lips.\n\nThe faithful girl took the thief\'s body from the stake, and mounted the pyre\nto burn herself. But the blessed god Shiva was staying invisibly in the\ncemetery, and at that moment he spoke from the sky: "O faithful wife, I am\npleased with your constancy to the husband of your choice. Choose whatever\nboon you will from me."\n\nThe girl worshipped the gracious god and chose her boon: "O blessed one, my\nfather has no son. May he have a hundred. Otherwise his childless life would\nend when I am gone."\n\nAnd the god spoke again from the sky: "O faithful wife, your father shall have\na hundred sons. But choose another boon. A woman faithful as you are deserves\nmore than the little thing you asked."\n\nThen she said: "O god, if I have won your favour, may this my husband live and\nalways be a good man."\n\nThe invisible Shiva spoke from the sky: "So be it. Your husband shall be made\nalive and well. He shall be a good man, and King Hero-banner shall be pleased\nwith him."\n\nThen the thief arose at once, alive and well. And the merchant Jewel was\noverjoyed and astonished. He took Pearl and the thief, his son-in-law, went\nhome with his rejoicing relatives, and made a feast great as his own delight,\nin honour of the sons he was to have.\n\nAnd the king was pleased when he learned the story, and in recognition of the\nstupendous courage of the thief, he appointed him general at once. The thief\nreformed, married the merchant\'s daughter, and lived happily with her, devoted\nto virtue.\n\n\n\nWhen the goblin had told this story, he reminded the king of the curse, and\nsaid: "O king, when the thief on the stake saw the merchant\'s daughter\napproaching with her father, did he weep or laugh? Tell me."\n\nAnd the king answered: "He thought: I can make no return to this merchant for\nhis unselfish friendship.\' Therefore he wept from grief. And he also thought:\nWhy does this girl reject kings and fall in love with a thief like me? How\nstrange women are!\' Therefore he laughed from astonishment."\n\nWhen the goblin heard this, he immediately slipped from the king\'s shoulder\nand escaped to his home. But the king was not discouraged. He followed him to\nthe sissoo tree.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fourteenth Goblin: The Man who changed into a Woman at Will.
