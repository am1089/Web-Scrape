The title is perhaps a little\nmisleading, as the description is not objective, but deals with the feelings\nawakened by each season in a pair of young lovers. Indeed, the poem might be\ncalled a Lover's Calendar. Kalidasa's authorship has been doubted, without\nvery cogent argument. The question is not of much interest, as _The Seasons_\nwould neither add greatly to his reputation nor subtract from it.\n\nThe whole poem contains one hundred and forty-four stanzas, or something less\nthan six hundred lines of verse. There follow a few stanzas selected from each\ncanto.\n\n### SUMMER\n\nPitiless heat from heaven pours  \n  By day, but nights are cool;  \nContinual bathing gently lowers  \n  The water in the pool;  \nThe evening brings a charming peace:  \n  For summer-time is here  \nWhen love that never knows surcease,  \n  Is less imperious, dear.\n\nYet love can never fall asleep;  \n  For he is waked to-day  \nBy songs that all their sweetness keep  \n  And lutes that softly play,  \nBy fans with sandal-water wet  \n  That bring us drowsy rest,  \nBy strings of pearls that gently fret  \n  Full many a lovely breast.\n\nThe sunbeams like the fires are hot  \n  That on the altar wake; p. 212  \nThe enmity is quite forgot  \n  Of peacock and of snake;  \nThe peacock spares his ancient foe,  \n  For pluck and hunger fail;  \nHe hides his burning head below  \n  The shadow of his tail.\n\nBeneath the garland of the rays  \n  That leave no corner cool,  \nThe water vanishes in haze  \n  And leaves a muddy pool;  \nThe cobra does not hunt for food  \n  Nor heed the frog at all  \nWho finds beneath the serpent's hood  \n  A sheltering parasol.\n\nDear maiden of the graceful song,  \n  To you may summer's power  \nBring moonbeams clear and garlands long  \n  And breath of trumpet-flower,  \nBring lakes that countless lilies dot,  \n  Refreshing water-sprays,  \nSweet friends at evening, and a spot  \n  Cool after burning days.\n\n### THE RAINS\n\nThe rain advances like a king  \n  In awful majesty;  \nHear, dearest, how his thunders ring  \n  Like royal drums, and see  \nHis lightning-banners wave; a cloud  \n  For elephant he rides,  \nAnd finds his welcome from the crowd  \n  Of lovers and of brides.\n\nThe clouds, a mighty army, march  \n  With drumlike thundering  \nAnd stretch upon the rainbow's arch  \n  The lightning's flashing string; p. 213  \nThe cruel arrows of the rain  \n  Smite them who love, apart  \nFrom whom they love, with stinging pain,  \n  And pierce them to the heart.\n\nThe forest seems to show its glee  \n  In flowering nipa plants;  \nIn waving twigs of many a tree  \n  Wind-swept, it seems to dance;  \nIts ketak-blossom's opening sheath  \n  Is like a smile put on  \nTo greet the rain's reviving breath,  \n  Now pain and heat are gone.\n\nTo you, dear, may the cloudy time  \n  Bring all that you desire,  \nBring every pleasure, perfect, prime,  \n  To set a bride on fire;  \nMay rain whereby life wakes and shines  \n  Where there is power of life,  \nThe unchanging friend of clinging vines,  \n  Shower blessings on my wife.\n\n### AUTUMN\n\nThe autumn comes, a maiden fair  \n  In slenderness and grace,  \nWith nodding rice-stems in her hair  \n  And lilies in her face.  \nIn flowers of grasses she is clad;  \n  And as she moves along,  \nBirds greet her with their cooing glad  \n  Like bracelets' tinkling song.\n\nA diadem adorns the night  \n  Of multitudinous stars;  \nHer silken robe is white moonlight,  \n  Set free from cloudy bars;  \nAnd on her face (the radiant moon)  \n  Bewitching smiles are shown: p. 214  \nShe seems a slender maid, who soon  \n  Will be a woman grown.\n\nOver the rice-fields, laden plants  \n  Are shivering to the breeze;  \nWhile in his brisk caresses dance  \n  The blossom-burdened trees;  \nHe ruffles every lily-pond  \n  Where blossoms kiss and part,  \nAnd stirs with lover's fancies fond  \n  The young man's eager heart.\n\n### WINTER\n\nThe bloom of tenderer flowers is past  \n  And lilies droop forlorn,  \nFor winter-time is come at last,  \n  Rich with its ripened corn;  \nYet for the wealth of blossoms lost  \n  Some hardier flowers appear  \nThat bid defiance to the frost  \n  Of sterner days, my dear.\n\nThe vines, remembering summer, shiver  \n  In frosty winds, and gain  \nA fuller life from mere endeavour  \n  To live through all that pain;  \nYet in the struggle and acquist  \n  They turn as pale and wan  \nAs lonely women who have missed  \n  Known love, now lost and gone.\n\nThen may these winter days show forth  \n  To you each known delight,  \nBring all that women count as worth  \n  Pure happiness and bright;  \nWhile villages, with bustling cry,  \n  Bring home the ripened corn,  \nAnd herons wheel through wintry sky,  \n  Forget sad thoughts forlorn.\n\np. 215\n\n### EARLY SPRING\n\nNow, dearest, lend a heedful ear  \n  And listen while I sing  \nDelights to every maiden dear,  \n  The charms of early spring:  \nWhen earth is dotted with the heaps  \n  Of corn, when heron-scream  \nIs rare but sweet, when passion leaps  \n  And paints a livelier dream.\n\nWhen all must cheerfully applaud  \n  A blazing open fire;  \nOr if they needs must go abroad,  \n  The sun is their desire;  \nWhen everybody hopes to find  \n  The frosty chill allayed  \nBy garments warm, a window-blind  \n  Shut, and a sweet young maid.\n\nThen may the days of early spring  \n  For you be rich and full  \nWith love's proud, soft philandering  \n  And many a candy-pull,  \nWith sweetest rice and sugar-cane:  \n  And may you float above  \nThe absent grieving and the pain  \n  Of separated love.\n\n### SPRING\n\nA stalwart soldier comes, the spring,  \n  Who bears the bow of Love;  \nAnd on that bow, the lustrous string  \n  Is made of bees, that move  \nWith malice as they speed the shaft  \n  Of blossoming mango-flower  \nAt us, dear, who have never laughed  \n  At love, nor scorned his power. p. 216\n\nTheir blossom-burden weights the trees;  \n  The winds in fragrance move;  \nThe lakes are bright with lotuses,  \n  The women bright with love;  \nThe days are soft, the evenings clear  \n  And charming; everything  \nThat moves and lives and blossoms, dear,  \n  Is sweeter, in the spring.\n\nThe groves are beautifully bright  \n  For many and many a mile  \nWith jasmine-flowers that are as white  \n  As loving woman's smile:  \nThe resolution of a saint  \n  Might well be tried by this;  \nFar more, young hearts that fancies paint  \n  With dreams of loving bliss.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
