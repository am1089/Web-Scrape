Dutt, [1899], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n# RAMAYANA BOOK IX\n\n# RAVANA-SABHA\n\n_\n\n(The Council of War)\n\n_\n\nRAVAN was thoroughly frightened by the deeds of Hanuman. For Hanuman had not\nonly penetrated into his island and discovered Sita in her imprisonment, but\nhad also managed to burn down a great portion of the city before he left the\nisland. Ravan called a Council of War, and as might be expected, all the\nadvisers heedlessly advised war.\n\nAll but Bibhishan. He was the youngest brother of Ravail, and condemned the\nfolly and the crime by which Ravan was seeking a war with the righteous and\nunoffending Rama. He advised that Sita should be restored to her lord and\npeace made with Rama. His voice was drowned in the cries of more violent\nadvisers.\n\nIt is noticeable that Ravan\'s second brother, Kumbha-karna, also had the\ncourage to censure his elder\'s action. But unlike Bibhishan he was determined\nto fight for his king whether he was right or wrong. There is a touch of\nsublimity in this blind and devoted loyalty of Kumbha-karna to the cause of\nhis king and his country.\n\nBibhishan was driven from the court with indiguity, and joined the forces of\nRama, to whom he gave much valuable information about Lanka and its warriors.\n\nThe passages translated in this Book form Sections vi., viii., ix., portions\nof Sections xii. and xv., and the whole of Section xvi. of Book vi. of the\noriginal text.\n\n## I\n\n## RAVAN SEEKS ADVICE\n\nMonarch of the mighty Rakshas, Ravan spake to warriors all,  \nSpake to gallant chiefs and princes gathered in his Council Hall:\n\n"Listen, Princes, Chiefs, and Warriors! Hanuman our land hath seen,  \nStealing through the woods of Lanka unto Rama\'s prisoned queen,\n\nAnd audacious in his purpose and resistless in his ire,  \nBurnt our turret tower and temple, wasted Lanka\'s town with fire!\n\nSpeak your counsel, gallant leaders, Ravan is intent to hear,  \nTriumph waits on fearless wisdom, speak your thoughts without a fear,\n\nWisest monarchs act on counsel from his men for wisdom known,  \nNext are they who in their wisdom and their daring act alone,\n\nLast, unwisest are the monarchs who nor death nor danger weigh,  \nThink not, ask not friendly counsel, by their passions borne away!\n\nWisest counsel comes from courtiers who in holy lore unite,  \nNext, when varying plans and reasons blending lead unto the right,\n\nLast end worst, when stormy passions mark the hapless king\'s debate,  \nAnd his friends are disunited when his foe is at the gate!\n\nTherefore freely speak your counsel and your monarch\'s task shall be  \nBut to shape in deed and action what your wisest thoughts decree,\n\nSpeak with rainds and hearts united, shape your willing monarch\'s deed,  \nCounsel peace, or Ravan\'s forces to a war of vengeance lead,\n\nEre Sugriva\'s countless forces cross the vast and boundless main,  \nEre the wrathful Rama girdles Lanka with a living chain!"\n\n## II\n\n## PRAHASTA\'S SPEECH\n\nDark and high as summer tempest mighty-armed Prahasta rose,  \nSpake in fierce and fierce accents hurling challenge on his foes:\n\n"Wherefore, Ravan, quails thy bosom, gods against thee strive in vain,  \nWherefore fear the feeble mortals, homeless hermits, helpless men?\n\nHanuman approached in secret, stealing like a craven spy,  \nNot from one in open combat would alive the Vanar fly,\n\nLet him come with all his forces, to the confines of the sea  \nI will chase the scattered army and thy town from foemen free!\n\nNot in fear and hesitation Ravan should repent his deed,  \nWhile his gallant Raksha forces stand beside him in his need,\n\nNot in tears and vain repentance Sita to his consort yield,  \nWhile his chieftains guard his empire in the battle\'s gory field!"\n\n## III\n\n## DURMUKHA\'S SPEECH\n\nDurmukha of cruel visage and of fierce and angry word,  \nRose within the Council Chamber, spake to Lanka\'s mighty lord:\n\n"Never shall the wily foeman boast of insult on us flung,  \nHanuman shall die a victim for the outrage and the wrong!\n\nStealing in unguarded Lanka through thy city\'s virgin gate,  \nHe hath courted deep disaster and a dark untimely fate,\n\nStealing in the inner mansions where our dames and damsels dwell,  \nHanuman shall die a victim,--tale of shame he shall not tell!\n\nNeed is none of Ravan\'s army, bid me seek the foe alone,  \nIf he hides in sky or ocean or in nether regions thrown,\n\nNeed is none of gathered forces, Ravan\'s mandate I obey,  \nI will smite the bold intruder and his Vanar forces slay!\n\n## IV\n\n## VAJRA-DANSHTRA\'S SPEECH\n\nIron-toothed Vajra-danshtra then arose in wrath and pride,  \nAnd his blood-stained mace of battle held in fury by his side,\n\n"Wherefore, Ravan, waste thy forces on the foemen poor and vile,  \nHermit Rama and his brother, Hanuman of impious wile,\n\nBid me,-with this mace of battle proud Sugriva I will slay,  \nChase the helpless hermit brothers to the forests far away!\n\nOr to deeper counsel listen! Varied shapes the Rakshas wear,  \nLet them wearing human visage. dressed as Bharat\'s troops appear,\n\nSuccour from his ruling brother Rama will in gladness greet,  \nThen with mace and blood-stained sabre we shall lay them at our feet,\n\nRock and javelin and arrow we shall on our foemen hail,  \nTill no poor surviving Vanar lives to tell the tragic tale!"\n\n## V\n\n## SPEECH OF NIKUMBHA AND VAJRA-HANU\n\nThen arose the brave Nikumbha,--Kumbha-kama\'s son was he,--  \nSpake his young heart\'s mighty passion in his accents bold and free:\n\n"Need is none, O mighty monarch, for a battle or a war,  \nBid me meet the homeless Rama and his brother wand\'ring far,\n\nBid me face the proud Sugriva, Hanuman of deepest wile,  \nI will rid thee of thy foemen and of Vanars poor and vile!"\n\nRose the chief with jaw of iron, Vajra-hanu fierce and young,  \nLicked his lips like hungry tiger with his red and lolling tongue:\n\nWherefore, monarch, dream of battle? Rakshas feed on human gore,  \nLet me feast upon thy foemen by the ocean\'s lonely shore,\n\nRama and his hermit brother, Hanuman who hides in wood,  \nAugad and the proud Sugriva soon shall be my welcome food!"\n\n## VI\n\n## BIBHISHAN\'S WARNING\n\nTwenty warriors armed and girded in the Council Hall arose,  \nThirsting for a war of vengeance, hurling challenge on the foes,\n\nBut Bibhishan deep in wisdom--Ravan\'s youngest brother he,--  \nSpake the word of solemn warning, for his eye could farthest see:\n\n"Pardon, king and honoured elder, if Bibhishan lifts his voice  \n\'Gainst the wishes of the warriors and the monarch\'s fatal choice,\n\nFirm in faith and strong in forces Rama comes with conqu\'ring might,  \nVain against a righteous warrior would unrighteous Ravan fight!\n\nThink him not a common Vanar who transpassed the ocean wave,  \nWrecked thy city tower and temple and a sign and warning gave,\n\nThink him not a common hermit who Ayodhya ruled of yore,  \nCrossing India\'s streams and mountains, thunders now on Lanka\'s shore!\n\nWhat dark deed of crime or folly hath the righteous Rama done,  \nThat you stole his faithful consort unprotected and alone,\n\nWhat offence or nameless insult hath the saintly Sita given,  \nShe who chained in Lanka\'s prison pleads in piteous tear to Heaven?\n\nTake my counsel, king and elder, Sita to her lord restore,  \nWipe this deed of wrong and outrage, Rama\'s righteous grace implore,\n\nTake my counsel, Raksha monarch, vain against him is thy might,  \nDoubly armed is the hero,--he who battles for the right!\n\nRender Sita to her Rama ere with vengeance swift and dire,  \nHe despoils our peopled Lanka with his bow and brand and fire,\n\nRender wife unto her husband ere in battle\'s dread array,  \nRama swoops upon thy empire like a falcon on its prey,\n\nRender to the lord his consort ere with blood of Rakshas slain,  \nRama soaks the land of Lanka to the margin of the main!\n\nListen to my friendly counsel,--though it be I stand alone,--  \nFaithful friend but fiery foeman is this Dasa-ratha\'s son,\n\nListen to my voice of warning,--Rama\'s shafts are true and keen,  \nFlaming like the with\'ring sunbeams on the summer\'s parched green,\n\nListen to my soft entreaty,-righteousness becomes the brave,  \nCherish peace and cherish virtue and thy sons and daughters save!"\n\n## VII\n\n## KUMBHA-KARNA\'S DETERMINATION\n\nRavan\'s brother Kumbha-karna, from his wonted slumber woke,  \nMightiest he of all the Rakshas, thus in solemn accents spoke:\n\nTruly speaks the wise Bibhishan; ere he stole a hermit\'s wife,  \nRavan should have thought and pondered, courted not a causeless strife,\n\nEre he did this deed of folly, Ravan should have counsel sought,  \nTardy is the vain repentance when the work of shame is wrought!\n\nWord of wisdom timely spoken saves from death and dangers dire,  \nVain is grief for crime committed,--offerings to unholy fire,\n\nVain is hero\'s worth or valour if by foolish counsel led,  \nToil and labour fail and perish save when unto wisdom wed,\n\nAnd the foeman speeds in triumph o\'er a heedless monarch\'s might,  \nAs through gaps of Krauncha mountains hansas speed their southern flight!\n\nRavan, thou hast sought unwisely Sita, in her calm retreat,  \nAs the wild and heedless hunter feeds upon the poisoned meat,\n\nNathless, faithful Kumbha-karna, will his loyal duty know,  \nHe shall fight his monarch\'s battle, he shall face his brother\'s foe!\n\nTrue to brother and to monarch, be he right or be he wrong,  \nKumbha-kama fights for Lanka \'gainst her foemen fierce and strong,\n\nRecks not if the mighty INDRA and VIVASVAT cross his path,  \nOr the wild and stormy MARUTS, AGNI in his fiery wrath!\n\nFor the Lord of Sky shall tremble when he sees my stature high,  \nAnd he hears his thunders echoed by my loud and answering cry,\n\nRama armed with ample quiver shall no second arrow send,  \nEre I slay him in the battle and his limb from limb I rend!\n\nWiser heads than Kumbha-karna right and true from wrong may know,  \nFaithful to his race and monarch he shall face the haughty foe,\n\nJoy thee in thy pleasure, Ravan, rule thy realm in regal pride,  \nWhen I slay the hermit Rama, widowed Sita be thy bride!"\n\n## VIII\n\n## INDRAJIT\'S ASSURANCE\n\nIndrajit the son of Ravan then his lofty purpose told,  \n\'Midst the best and boldest Rakshas none so gallant, none so bold:\n\n"Wherefore, noble king and father, pale Bibhishan\'s counsel hear,  \nScion of the race of Rakshas speaks not thus in dastard fear,\n\nIn this race of valiant Rakshas, known for deeds of glory done,  \nFeeble-hearted, faint in courage, save Bibhishan, there is none!\n\nMatched with meanest of the Rakshas what are sons of mortal men,  \nWhat are homeless human brothers hiding in the hermit\'s den,\n\nShall we yield to weary wand\'rers, driven from their distant home,  \nChased from throne and father\'s kingdom in the desert woods to roam?\n\nLord of sky and nether region, INDRA \'neath my weapon fell,  \nPale Immortals know my valour and my warlike deeds can tell,\n\nINDRA\'S tusker, huge Airavat, by my prowess overthrown,  \nTrumpeted its anguished accents, shaking sky and earth with groan,\n\nMighty Gods and dauntless Daityas fame of Indrajit may know,  \nAnd he yields not, king and father, to a homeless human foe!"\n\n## IX\n\n## RAVAN\'s DECISION\n\nAnger swelled in Ravan\'s bosom as he cast his blood-red eye  \nOn Bibhishan calm and fearless, and he spake in accents high:\n\n"Rather dwell with open foemen or in homes where cobras haunt,  \nThan with faithless friends who falter and whom fears of danger daunt!\n\nO, the love of near relations!-false and faithless, full of guile,  \nHow they sorrow at my glory, at my danger how they smile,\n\nHow they grieve with secret anguish when my loftier virtues shine,  \nHow they harbour jealous envy when deserts and fame are mine,\n\nHow they scan with curious vision every fault that clouds my path,  \nHow they wait with eager longing till I fall in Fortune\'s wrath\n\nAsk the elephants of jungle how their captors catch and bind.--  \nNot by fire and feeble weapons, but by treason of their kind,\n\nNot by javelin or arrow,--little for these arms they care,--  \nBut their false and fondling females lead them to the hunter\'s snare!\n\nLong as nourishment and vigour shall impart the milk of cow,  \nLong as woman shall be changeful, hermits holy in their vow,\n\nAve. so long shall near relations bate us in their inner mind,  \nMark us with a secret envy though their words be ne\'er so kind!\n\nRain-drops fall upon the lotus but unmingling hang apart,  \nFalse relations round us gather but they blend not heart with heart,\n\nWinter clouds are big with thunder but they shed no freshening rain,  \nFalse relations smile and greet us but their soothing words are vain,\n\nBees are tempted by the honey but from flower to flower they range,  \nFalse relations share our favour but in secret seek a change!\n\nLying is thy speech, Bibhishan, secret envy hirks within,  \nThou wouldst rule thy elder\'s empire, thou wouldst wed thy elder\'s queen,\n\nTake thy treason to the foemen,--brother\'s blood I may not shed,--  \nOther Raksha craven-hearted by my royal hands had bled!"\n\n## X\n\n## BIBHISHAN\'S DEPARTURE\n\nThis to me Bibhishan answered, as with fiery comrades four,  \nRose in arms the wrathful Raksha and in fury rushed before.\n\n"But I spare thee, roval Ravan, angry words thy lips have passed,  \nFalse and lying and unfounded is the censure thou hast cast!\n\nTrue Bibhishan sought thy safety, strove to save his elder\'s reign,--  \nSpeed thee now to thy destruction since all counsel is in vain,\n\nMany are thy smiling courtiers who with honeyed speech beguile,--  \nFew are they with truth and candour speak their purpose void of guile!\n\nBlind to reason and to wisdow, Ravan seek thy destined fate,  \nFor thy impious lust of woman, for thy dark unrighteous hate,\n\n_\n\nBlind to danger and destruction, deaf to word of counsel given,  \nBy the flaming shaft, of Rama thou shalt die by will of Heaven!\n\nYet, O! yet, my king and elder, let me plead with latest breath,  \n\'Gainst the death of race and kismen, \'gainst my lord and brother\'s death,\n\nPonder yet, O Raksha monarch, save thy race and save thy own,  \nRavan, part we now ever,--guard thy ancient sea-girt throne!"\n\n_\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book X: The War in Ceylon](rama10.htm)\n\n'
