If more we can,  \nDevise, O King, and tell thy plan.'  \n   His chidren's speech King Sagar heard,  \nAnd answered thus, to anger stirred:  \n'Dig on, and ne'er your labour stay  \nTill through earth's depths you force your way.  \nThen smite the robber dead, and bring  \nThe charger back with triumphing.'  \n\np. 52  \n\n   The sixty thousand chiefs obeyed:  \nDeep through the earth their way they made.  \nDeep as they dug and deeper yet  \nThe immortal elephant they met,  \nFamed Virupaksha  1 vast of size,  \nUpon whose head the broad earth lies:  \nThe mighty beast who earth sustains  \nWith shaggy hills and wooded plains.  \nWhen, with the changing moon, distressed,  \nAnd longing for a moment's rest,  \nHis mighty head the monster shakes,  \nEarth to the bottom reels and quakes.  \nAround that warder strong and vast  \nWith reverential steps they passed.  \nNor, when the honour due was paid,  \nTheir downward search through earth delayed.  \nBut turning from the east aside  \nSouthward again their task they plied.  \nThere Mahapadma held his place,  \nThe best of all his mighty race,  \nLike some huge hill, of monstrous girth,  \nUpholding on his head the earth.  \nWhen the vast beast the princes saw,  \nThey marvelled and were tilled with awe.  \nThe sons of high-souled Sagar round  \nThat elephant in reverence wound.  \nThen in the western region they  \nWith might unwearied cleft their way.  \nThere saw they with astonisht eyes  \nSaumanas, beast of mountain size.  \nRound him with circling steps they went  \nWith greetings kind and reverent.  \n   On, on--no thought of rest or stay--  \nThey reached the seat of Soma's sway.  \nThere saw they Bhadra, white as snow,  \nWith lucky marks that fortune show,  \nBearing the earth upon his head.  \nRound him they paced with solemn tread,  \n\nAnd honoured him with greetings kind,  \nThen downward yet their way they mined.  \nThey gained the tract 'twixt east and north  \nWhose fame is ever blazoned forth, [1b](ry042.htm#fn_189)  \nAnd by a storm of rage impelled,  \nDigging through earth their course they held.  \n   Then all the princes, lofty-souled,  \nOf wondrous vigour, strong and bold,  \nSaw Vasudeva  [2b](ry042.htm#fn_190) standing there  \nIn Kapil's form he loved to wear,  \nAnd near the everlasting God  \nThe victim charger cropped the sod.  \nThey saw with joy and eager eyes  \nThe fancied robber and the prize,  \nAnd on him rushed the furious band  \nCrying aloud, Stand, villain! stand!  \n'Avaunt! avaunt!' great Kapil cried,  \nHis bosom flusht with passion's tide;  \nThen by his might that proud array  \nAll scorcht to heaps of ashes lay.

Bad men, you violate  \n   A double marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,  \n   And then between me and my married wife.'  \n                         King Richard II. Act V. Sc. I.  \n\n[51:3b](ry041.htm#fr_187) The thirty-three Gods are said in the _Aitareya. Br\nahmana_.Book 1. ch. II. 10. to be the eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras, the\ntwelve \xc3\x80dityas, Prajapati, either Brahma or Daksha, and Vashatkara or deitied\noblation. This must have been the actual number at the beginning of the Vedic\nreligion gradually increased by successive mythical and religious creations\ntill the Indian Pantheon was crowded with abstractions of every kind. Through\nthe reverence with which the words of the Veda were regarded, the immense host\nof multiplied divinities, in later times, still bore the name of the Thirty-\nthree Gods.\n\n[52:1](ry041.htm#fr_188) 'One of the elephants which, according to an ancient\nbelief popular in India, supported the earth with their enormous backs; when\none of these elephants shook his wearied head the earth trembled with its\nwoods and hills. An idea, or rather a mythical fancy, similar to this, but\nreduced to proportions less grand, is found in Virgil when he speaks of\nEnceladus buried under \xc3\x86tna:\n\n  \n  'Fama est Enceladi semiustum fulmine corpus  \n   Urgeri molo haec, ingentemque insuper \xc3\x86tnam  \n   Impositam, ruptis flammam expirare caminis;  \n   Et fessum quoties mutat latus, intremere omnem  \n   Murmure Trinacriam, et coelum subtexere fumo.'  \n                                 \xc3\x86neid.
