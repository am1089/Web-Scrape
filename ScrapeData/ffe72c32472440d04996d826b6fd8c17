But \xc3\x82ru _n_ i sent his son, _S_\nvetaketu, and said: 'Perform the sacrifice for him.' When _S_ vetaketu 3 had\narrived, _K_ itra asked him: 'Son of Gautama 4, is there a hidden place in the\nworld where you are able to place me, or is it the other way, and are you\ngoing to place me in the world to which it (that other way) leads 5?'\n\np. 272\n\nHe answered and said: 'I do not know this. But, let me ask the master.' Having\napproached his father, he asked: 'Thus has _K_ itra asked me; how shall I\nanswer?'\n\np. 273\n\n\xc3\x82ru _n_ i said: 'I also do not know this. Only after having learnt the proper\nportion of the Veda in _K_ itra's own dwelling, shall we obtain what others\ngive us (knowledge). Come, we will both go.'\n\nHaving said this he took fuel in his hand (like a pupil), and approached _K_\nitra Ga\xe1\xb9\x85gyayani, saying: 'May I come near to you?' He replied: 'You are worthy\nof Brahman 1, O Gautama, because you were not led away by pride. Come hither,\nI shall make you know clearly.'\n\n2\\. And _K_ itra said: All who depart from this world (or this body) go to the\nmoon 2. In the former, (the bright) half, the moon delights in their spirits;\nin the other, (the dark) half, the moon sends them on\n\np. 274\n\nto be born again 1. Verily, the moon is the door of the Svarga world (the\nheavenly world). Now, if a man objects to the moon (if one is not satisfied\nwith life there) the moon sets him free 2. But if a man does not object, then\nthe moon sends him down as rain upon this earth. And according to his deeds\nand according to his knowledge he is born again here as a worm, or as an\ninsect, or as a fish, or as a bird, or as a lion, or as a boar, or as a\nserpent 3, or as a tiger, or as a man, or as something else in different\nplaces 4. When he has thus returned to the earth, some one (a sage) asks: 'Who\nart thou?' And he should answer: 'From the wise moon, who orders the seasons\n5, when it is born consisting of fifteen parts, from the moon who is the home\nof our ancestors, the seed was brought. This seed, even me, they (the gods\nmentioned in the Pa\xc3\xb1 _k_ agnividya 6) gathered up in an active man, and\nthrough an active\n\np. 275\n\nman they brought me to a mother. Then I, growing up to be born, a being living\nby months, whether twelve or thirteen, was together with my father, who also\nlived by (years of) twelve or thirteen months, that I might either know it\n(the true Brahman) or not know it. Therefore, O ye seasons 1, grant that I may\nattain immortality (knowledge of Brahman). By this my true saying, by this my\ntoil (beginning with the dwelling in the moon and ending with my birth on\nearth) I am (like) a season, and the child of the seasons.' 'Who art thou?'\nthe sage asks again. 'I am thou,' he replies. Then he sets him free 2 (to\nproceed onward).\n\nHe (at the time of death), having reached the path of the gods, comes to the\nworld of Agni (fire), to the world of Vayu (air), to the world of Varu _n_ a,\nto the world of Indra, to the world of Pra _g_ apati (Vira _g_ ), to the world\nof Brahman (Hira _n_ yagarbha). In that world there is the lake \xc3\x82ra 3, the\nmoments called Yesh _t_ iha 4, the river Vi _g_ ara (age-less), the tree Ilya\n5, the city Sala _g_ ya, the palace Apara _g_ ita (unconquerable), the door-\nkeepers Indra\n\np. 276\n\nand Pra _g_ apati, the hall of Brahman, called Vibhu 1 (built by vibhu,\negoism), the throne Vi _k_ aksha _n_ a (buddhi, perception), the couch Amitau\n_g_ as (endless splendour), and the beloved Manasi (mind) and her image _K_\nakshushi (eye), who, as if taking flowers, are weaving the worlds, and the\nApsaras, the Ambas (sruti, sacred scriptures), and Ambayavis (buddhi,\nunderstanding), and the rivers Ambayas (leading to the knowledge of Brahman).\nTo this world he who knows this (who knows the Parya\xe1\xb9\x85ka-vidya) approaches.\nBrahman says to him: 'Run towards him (servants) with such worship as is due\nto myself. He has reached the river Vi _g_ ara (age-less), he will never age.\n\n4\\. Then five hundred Apsaras go towards him, one hundred with garlands in\ntheir hands, one hundred with ointments in their hands, one hundred with\nperfumes in their hands, one hundred with garments in their hands, one hundred\nwith fruit 2 in their hands. They adorn him with an adornment worthy of\nBrahman, and when thus adorned with the adornment of Brahman, the knower of\nBrahman moves towards Brahman (neut.) 3 He comes to the lake \xc3\x82ra, and he\ncrosses it by the mind, while those who come to it without knowing the truth\n4, are drowned. He comes to the moments called Yesh _t_ iha, they flee from\nhim.\n\np. 277\n\nHe comes to the river Vi _g_ ara, and crosses it by the mind alone, and there\nshakes off his good and evil deeds. His beloved relatives obtain the good, his\nunbeloved relatives the evil he has done. And as a man, driving in a chariot,\nmight look at the two wheels (without being touched by them), thus he will\nlook at day and night, thus at good and evil deeds, and at all pairs (at all\ncorrelative things, such as light and darkness, heat and cold, &c.) Being\nfreed from good and freed from evil he, the knower of Brahman (neut.), moves\ntowards Brahman.\n\n5\\. He approaches the tree Ilya, and the odour of Brahman reaches him. He\napproaches the city Sala _g_ ya, and the flavour of Brahman reaches him. He\napproaches the palace Apara _g_ ita, and the splendour of Brahman reaches him.\nHe approaches the door-keepers Indra and Pra _g_ apati, and they run away from\nhim. He approaches the hall Vibhu, and the glory of Brahman reaches him (he\nthinks, I am Brahman). He approaches the throne Vi _k_ aksha _n_ a. The Saman\nverses, B _ri_ had and Rathantara, are the eastern feet of that throne 1; the\nSaman verses, _S_ yaita and Naudhasa, its western feet; the Saman verses,\nVairupa and Vaira _g_ a, its sides lengthways (south and north); the Saman\nverses, _S_ akvara and Raivata, its sides crossways (east and west). That\nthrone is Pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a, knowledge, for by knowledge (self-knowledge) he sees\nclearly. He approaches the couch Amitau _g_ as. That is Pra _n_ a (speech).\nThe past and the future are its eastern feet; prosperity and earth its western\nfeet; the Saman verses, Brihad and Rathantara, are the two sides lengthways of\nthe couch (south and north);\n\np. 278\n\nthe Saman verses, Bhadra and Ya _g_ \xc3\xb1aya _g_ \xc3\xb1iya, are its cross-sides at the\nhead and feet (east and west); the _Ri_ _k_ and Saman are the long sheets 1\n(east and west); the Ya _g_ us the cross-sheets (south and north); the moon-\nbeam the cushion; the Udgitha the (white) coverlet; prosperity the pillow 2.\nOn this couch sits Brahman, and he who knows this (who knows himself one with\nBrahman sitting on the couch) mounts it first with one foot only. Then Brahman\nsays to him: 'Who art thou?' and he shall answer:\n\n6\\. 'I am (like) a season, and the child of the seasons, sprung from the womb\nof endless space, from the light (from the luminous Brahman). The light, the\norigin of the year, which is the past, which is the present, which is all\nliving things, and all elements, is the Self 3. Thou art the Self. What thou\nart, that am U\n\nBrahman says to him: 'Who am I?' He shall answer: 'That which is, the true'\n(Sat-tyam).\n\nBrahman asks: 'What is the true?' He says to him: 'What is different from the\ngods and from the senses (pra _n_ a) that is Sat, but the gods and the\n\np. 279\n\nsenses are Tyam. Therefore by that name Sattya (true) is called all this\nwhatever there is. All this thou art.'\n\n7\\. This is also declared by a verse: 'This great _Ri_ shi, whose belly is the\nYa _g_ us, the head the Saman, the form the _Ri_ _k_ , is to be known as being\nimperishable, as being Brahman.'\n\nBrahman says to him: 'How dost thou obtain my male names?' He should answer:\n'By breath (pra _n_ a _h_ ).'\n\nBrahman asks: 'How my female names?' He should answer: 'By speech (va _k_ ).'\n\nBrahman asks: 'How my neuter names?' He should answer: 'By mind (manas).'\n\n'How smells?' 'By the nose.' 'How forms?' 'By the eye.' 'How sounds?' 'By the\near.' 'How flavours of food?' 'By the tongue.' 'How actions?' 'By the hands.'\n'How pleasures and pain?' 'By the body.' 'How joy, delight, and offspring?'\n'By the organ.' 'How journeyings?' 'By the feet.' 'How thoughts, and what is\nto be known and desired?' 'By knowledge (pra _g_ \xc3\xb1a) alone.'\n\nBrahman says to him: 'Water indeed is this my world 1, the whole Brahman\nworld, and it is thine.'\n\nWhatever victory, whatever might belongs to Brahman, that victory and that\nmight he obtains who knows this, yea, who knows this 2.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[271:1](sbe01239.htm#fr_696) It is difficult to determine whether _K_ itra's\nname was Ga\xe1\xb9\x85gyayani or Gargyaya _n_ i. Professor Weber adopted first Gargyaya\n_n_ i (Indische Studien 1, P. 395), afterwards Ga\xe1\xb9\x85gyayani (ibid. II, 395).\nProfessor Cowell adopts Ga\xe1\xb9\x85gyayani, but he tells us that the Telugu MS. reads\nGargyaya _n_ i throughout, and the other MSS. B, C do so occasionally. The\ncommentator explains Ga\xe1\xb9\x85gyayani as the descendant (yuvapatyam) of Ga\xe1\xb9\x85gya. I\nconfess a preference for Gargyaya _n_ i, because both Ga\xe1\xb9\x85ga and Ga\xe1\xb9\x85gya are\nnames of rare occurrence in ancient Vedic literature, but I admit that for\nthat very reason the transition of Ga\xe1\xb9\x85gyayani into Gargyaya _n_ i is perhaps\nmore intelligible than that of Gargyaya _n_ i into Ga\xe1\xb9\x85gyayani.\n\n[271:2](sbe01239.htm#fr_697) Cf. _Kh_. Up. V, 11, 2; B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. VI, 2, 1.\n\n[271:3](sbe01239.htm#fr_698) Cf. _Kh_. Up. V, 3; VI, 1.\n\n[271:4](sbe01239.htm#fr_699) B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. VI, 2, 4.\n\n[271:5](sbe01239.htm#fr_700) The question put by _K_ itra to _S_ vetaketu is\nvery obscure, and was probably from the first intended to be obscure in its\nvery wording. What _K_ itra wished to ask we can gather from other passages in\nthe Upanishads, where we see another royal sage, Pravaha _n_ a Gaivali ( _Kh_.\nUp. V, 3; B _ri_ h. \xc3\x82r. VI, 2), enlightening _S_ vetaketu on the future life.\nThat future life is reached by two roads; p. 272 one, the Devapatha, leading\nto the world of Brahman (the conditioned), beyond which there lies one other\nstage only, represented by knowledge of and identity with the unconditioned\nBrahman; the other leading to the world of the fathers, and from thence, after\nthe reward of good works has been consumed, back to a new round of mundane\nexistence. There is a third road for creatures which live and die, worms,\ninsects, and creeping things, but they are of little consequence. Now it is\nquite clear that the knowledge which king _K_ itra possesses, and which _S_\nvetaketu does not possess, is that of the two roads after death, sometimes\ncalled the right and the left, or the southern and northern roads. These roads\nare fully described in the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad and in the B _ri_ had-ara\n_n_ yaka, with certain variations, yet on the whole with the same purpose. The\nnorthern or left road, called also the path of the Devas, passes on from light\nand day to the bright half of the moon; the southern or right road, called\nalso the path of the fathers, passes on from smoke and night to the dark half\nof the moon. Both roads therefore meet in the moon, but diverge afterwards.\nWhile the northern road passes by the six months when the sun moves towards\nthe north, through the sun, (moon,) and the lightning to the world of Brahman,\nthe southern passes by the six months when the sun moves towards the south, to\nthe world of the fathers, the ether, and the moon. The great difference,\nhowever, between the two roads is, that while those who travel on the former\ndo not return again to a new life on earth, but reach in the end a true\nknowledge of the unconditioned Brahman, those who pass on to the world of the\nfathers and the moon return to earth to be born again and again.\n\nThe question therefore which _K_ itra addresses to _S_ vetaketu can refer to\nthese two roads only, and though the text is very corrupt, and was so\nevidently even at the time when the commentary was written, we must try to\nrestore it in accordance with the teaching imparted by _K_ itra in what\nfollows. I propose to read: Gautamasya putra, asti sa _m_ v _ri_ ta _m_ loke\nyasmin ma dhasyasy anyatamo vadhva tasya (or yasya) ma loke dhasyasi, 'Is\nthere a hidden place in the world where you (by your sacrificing and teaching)\nare able to p. 273 place me, or is it the other way, and will you place me in\nthe world to which it leads?' Even thus the text is by no means satisfactory,\nbut it is better than anyam aho vadhva, adopted by the commentator and\nexplained by him: Is there a hidden place in that world in which you will\nplace me as another, i. e. as different from the whole world or identical with\nthe whole world, and, if as different, then having bound me (vadhva = baddhva)\nand made me a different person? We may read anyataro for anyatamo vadhva. The\ncommentator sums up the question as referring to a hidden or not hidden place,\nwhere _K_ itra should be placed as another person or not another person, as\nbound or not bound; or, as Professor Cowell renders it, 'O son of Gautama, is\nthere any secret place in the world where thou canst set me unconnected,\nhaving fixed me there (as wood united with glue); or is there some other place\nwhere thou canst set me?' The speculations on the fate of the soul after death\nseem to have been peculiar to the royal families of India, while the Brahmans\ndwelt more on what may be called the shorter cut, a knowledge of Brahman as\nthe true Self. To know, with them, was to be, and, after the dissolution of\nthe body, they looked forward to immediate emancipation, without any further\nwanderings.\n\n[273:1](sbe01239.htm#fr_701) Worthy to know Brahman, or, as the commentator,\nwho reads brahmargha, thinks, to be honoured like Brahman.\n\n[273:2](sbe01239.htm#fr_702) Both roads lead to the moon, and diverge\nafterwards.\n\n[274:1](sbe01239.htm#fr_703) I should like to read aparapakshe pra _g_\nanayati, instead of aparapakshe _n_ a, or aparapakshe na. The negative is out\nof the question, for pra _g_ anayati, he sends into a new life, is exactly\nwhat the moon does to those who do not proceed on the Devapatha to the\nBrahmaloka. Therefore if the reading aparapakshena must be retained, it should\nbe rendered by 'the moon with the dark half sends them into a new life.'\n\n[274:2](sbe01239.htm#fr_704) This is supposed to be the hidden place, or\nrather the way to it, when the departed leave the moon, and pass on to\nlightning and to the world of Brahman. This is in fact the Devayana, as\nopposed to the Pit _ri_ yana, described in the _Kh_ andogya-upanishad.\n\n[274:3](sbe01239.htm#fr_705) Para _s_ va, danda _s_ ukavi _s_ esha _h_. There\nis no authority for translating it by dog; cf. Indische Studien I, 396.\n\n[274:4](sbe01239.htm#fr_706) This might even include naraka or hell.\n\n[274:5](sbe01239.htm#fr_707) If _ri_ tava _h_ is here the genitive of _ri_ tu,\nits meaning would be the ordainer of the seasons; cf. Hibbert Lectures, p.\n247. Vi _k_ aksha _n_ a is applied to the moon again, II, 9, and the throne of\nBrahman also is called vi _k_ aksha _n_ a, I, 3.\n\n[274:6](sbe01239.htm#fr_708) _Kh_. Up. V, 4-8.\n\n[275:1](sbe01239.htm#fr_709) The commentator takes ritavah as an accusative. I\ntake it as a vocative, and as used in a sense analogous to the Zend ratu, an\nepithet of Ahura. Darmesteter, Ormazd, p. 12, n. 3.\n\n[275:2](sbe01239.htm#fr_710) If a person fears heaven (svarga) as much as\nhell, because neither gives final liberation, then he is fit to proceed to a\nknowledge of Brahman. It would seem that after this, this person is in the\nsame position as the other who, objecting to remain in the moon, was set free\nat once.\n\n[275:3](sbe01239.htm#fr_711) Consisting of ari's, enemies, such as love,\nanger, &c. In the _Kh_. Up. VIII, 5, 3, it is called Ara.\n\n[275:4](sbe01239.htm#fr_712) Explained to mean, killing the sacrifice, which\nconsists in a desire for Brahman.\n\n[275:5](sbe01239.htm#fr_713) The same as the a _s_ vattha _h_ somasavana _h_\nin _Kh_. Up. VIII, 5, 3\n\n[276:1](sbe01239.htm#fr_714) Vibhunamakam pramita _m_ sabhasthalam.\n\n[276:2](sbe01239.htm#fr_715) Some MSS. read pha _n_ ahasta _h_ , and the\ncommentator explains pha _n_ a by abhara _n_ a.\n\n[276:3](sbe01239.htm#fr_716) Though brahman is used here as a neuter, it\nrefers to the conditioned Brahman.\n\n[276:4](sbe01239.htm#fr_717) Samprativid is here explained as brahmavidya _s_\nunya, ignorant, while in other places (Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 3, 1) it stands for\nsamyagabhi _g_ \xc3\xb1a. If the latter is the true meaning, we might read here tam\nitvasamprativido.\n\n[277:1](sbe01239.htm#fr_718) Cf. Atharva-veda XV; Aufrecht, in Indische\nStudien I, p. 122.\n\n[278:1](sbe01239.htm#fr_719) Sheets or coverings seem more applicable here\nthan mere threads forming the woof and warp; cf. Aufrecht, Indische Studien I,\np. 131.\n\n[278:2](sbe01239.htm#fr_720) I read udgitha upa _s_ ri _h_ , _s_ rir upabarha\n_n_ am. The Atharva text has udgitho 'pa _s_ raya _h_.\n\n[278:3](sbe01239.htm#fr_721) This passage is corrupt, and the various readings\nand various interpretations of the commentators do not help us much. One view,\nwhich I have followed, as far as possible, is that it had to be explained how\nthe same being could be the child of the seasons, or living from year to year,\nand, at the same time, born of the light. The answer is, Because light is the\nseed or cause of the year, and the year the cause of everything else. I take\nno responsibility for this view, and I see no way of discovering the original\nreading and the original meaning of these sentences.\n\n[279:1](sbe01239.htm#fr_722) it sprang from water and the other elements.\nComm. Professor Weber proposes to translate apa _h_ by Erlangungen,\nacquisitions, with reference to apnoshi, 'how dost thou acquire my names?' in\nwhat precedes.\n\n[279:2](sbe01239.htm#fr_723) Who knows the conditioned and mythological form\nof Brahman as here described, sitting on the couch.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Adhyaya II](sbe01240.htm)\n\n"
