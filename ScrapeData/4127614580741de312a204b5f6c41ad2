To the princely youth  \nWho loved the right and spoke the truth,  \nCruel, abominable came  \nThe answer of the ruthless dame:  \n'When Gods and Titans fought of yore,  \nTransfixed with darts and bathed in gore  \nTwo boons to me thy father gave  \nFor the dear life 'twas mine to save.  \nOf him I claim the ancient debt,  \nThat Bharat on the throne be set,  \nAnd thou, O Rama, go this day  \nTo Dandak forest far away.  \nNow, Rama, if thou wilt maintain  \nThy father's faith without a stain,  \nAnd thine own truth and honour clear,  \nThen, best of men, my bidding hear.  \nDo thou thy father's word obey,  \nNor from the pledge he gave me stray.  \nThy life in Dandak forest spend  \nTill nine long years and five shall end.  \nUpon my Bharat's princely head  \nLet consecrating drops be shed,  \nWith all the royal pomp for thee  \nMade ready by the king's decree.  \nSeek Dandak forest and resign  \nRites that would make the empire thine,  \nFor twice seven years of exile wear  \nThe coat of bark and matted hair.  \nThen in thy stead let Bharat reign  \nLord of his royal sire's domain,  \nRich in the fairest gems that shine,  \nCars, elephants, and steeds, and kine.  \nThe monarch mourns thy altered fate  \nAnd vails his brow compassionate:  \nBowed down by bitter grief he lies  \nAnd dares not lift to thine his eyes.  \nObey his word: be firm and brave,  \nAnd with great truth the monarch save.'  \n   While thus with cruel words she spoke,  \n     No grief the noble youth betrayed;  \n   But forth the father's anguish broke,  \n     At his dear Rama's lot dismayed.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[113:1](ry095.htm#fr_285) The Sea.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XIX.: Rama's Promise.](ry097.htm)\n\n"
