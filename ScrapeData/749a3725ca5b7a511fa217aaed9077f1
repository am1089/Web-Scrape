There is non-restriction of determination, because this is seen; for\nthere is a separate fruit, viz. non-obstruction.\n\nThere are certain meditations connected with elements of sacrificial actions;\nas e.g. 'Let a man meditate on the syllable Om as udgitha.' These meditations\nare subordinate elements of the sacrificial acts with which they connect\nthemselves through the udgitha and so on, in the same way as the quality of\nbeing made of par _n_ a wood connects itself with the sacrifice through the\nladle (made of par _n_ a wood), and are to be undertaken on that very account.\nMoreover the statement referring to these meditations, viz. 'whatever he does\nwith knowledge, with faith, with the Upanishad, that becomes more vigorous,'\ndoes not allow the assumption of a special fruit for these meditations (apart\nfrom the fruit of the sacrificial performance); while in the case of the ladle\nbeing made of par _n_ a wood the text mentions a special fruit ('he whose\nladle is made of par _n_ a wood does not hear an evil sound'). The meditations\nin question are therefore necessarily to be connected with the particular\nsacrificial performances to which they belong.--This view the Sutra refutes,\n'There is non-restriction with regard to the determinations.' By\n'determination' we have here to understand the definite settling of the mind\nin a certain direction, in other words, meditation. The meditations on the\nudgitha and so on are not definitely connected with the sacrificial\nperformances; 'since that is seen,' i.e. since the texts themselves declare\nthat there is no such necessary connexion; cp. the text, 'therefore both\nperform the sacrificial work, he who thus knows it\n\np. 665\n\n[paragraph continues] (i. e. who possesses the knowledge implied in the\nmeditations on the sacrifice), as well as he who does not know'--which\ndeclares that he also who does not know the meditations may perform the work.\nWere these meditations auxiliary elements of the works, there could be no such\nabsence of necessary connexion (as declared in this text). It thus being\ndetermined that they are not auxiliary elements, a special result must be\nassigned to the injunction of meditation, and this we find in the greater\nstrength which is imparted to the sacrifice by the meditation, and which is a\nresult different from the result of the sacrifice itself. The _greater\nstrength_ of the performance consists herein, that its result is not impeded,\nas it might be impeded, by the result of some other performance of greater\nforce. This result, viz. absence of obstruction, is something apart from the\ngeneral result of the action, such as the reaching of the heavenly world, and\nso on. This the Sutra means when saying, 'for separate is non-obstruction.' As\nthus those meditations also which refer to auxiliary members of sacrifices\nhave their own results, they may or may not be combined with the sacrifices,\naccording to wish. Their case is like that of the godohana vessel which, with\nthe view of obtaining a certain special result, may be used instead of the _k_\namasa.--Here terminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'non-restriction of\ndetermination.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 42.
