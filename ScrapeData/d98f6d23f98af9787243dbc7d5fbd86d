The 'two entered into the cave' (are the individual soul and the highest\nSelf), for the two are (intelligent) Selfs (and therefore of the same nature),\nas it is seen (that numerals denote beings of the same nature).\n\nIn the same Ka _th_ avalli we read (I, 3, 1), 'There are the two drinking the\nreward of their works in the world, (i.e. the body,) entered into the cave,\ndwelling on the highest summit. Those who know Brahman call them shade and\nlight; likewise those householders who perform the Tri _n_ a _k_ iketa\nsacrifice.'\n\nHere the doubt arises whether the mind (buddhi) and the individual soul are\nreferred to, or the individual soul and the highest Self. If the mind and the\nindividual soul, then the individual soul is here spoken of as different from\nthe aggregate of the organs of action, (i.e. the body,) among which the mind\noccupies the first place. And a statement on this point is to be expected, as\na question concerning it is asked in a preceding passage, viz. I, 1, 20,\n'There is that doubt when a man is dead--some saying he is; others, he is not.\nThis I should like to know taught by thee; this is the third of my boons.' If,\non the other hand, the passage refers to the individual soul and the highest\nSelf, then it intimates that the highest Self is different from the individual\nsoul; and this also requires to be declared here, on account of the question\ncontained in the passage (I, 2, 14), 'That which thou seest as different from\nreligious duty and its contrary, from effect and cause, from the past and the\nfuture, tell me that.'\n\nThe doubt to which the passage gives rise having thus\n\np. 119\n\nbeen stated, a caviller starts the following objection: neither of the stated\nviews can be maintained.--Why?--On account of the characteristic mark implied\nin the circumstance that the two are said to drink, i.e. to enjoy, the fruit\nof their works in the world. For this can apply to the intelligent individual\nsoul only, not to the non-intelligent buddhi. And as the dual form 'drinking'\n(pibantau) shows that both are drinking, the view of the two being the buddhi\nand the individual soul is not tenable. For the same reason the other opinion\nalso, viz. of the two being the individual soul and the highest Self, cannot\nbe maintained; for drinking (i.e. the fruition of reward) cannot be predicated\nof the highest Self, on account of the mantra (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1), 'The other\nlooks on without eating.'\n\nThese objections, we reply, are without any force. Just as we see that in\nphrases such as 'the men with the umbrella (lit. the umbrella-men) are\nwalking,' the attribute of being furnished with an umbrella which properly\nspeaking belongs to one man only is secondarily ascribed to many, so here two\nagents are spoken of as drinking because one of them is really drinking. Or\nelse we may explain the passage by saying that, while the individual soul only\ndrinks, the Lord also is said to drink because he makes the soul drink. On the\nother hand, we may also assume that the two are the buddhi and the individual\nsoul, the instrument being figuratively spoken of as the agent--a figure of\nspeech exemplified by phrases such as 'the fuel cooks (the food).' And in a\nchapter whose topic is the soul no two other beings can well be represented as\nenjoying rewards. Hence there is room for the doubt whether the two are the\nbuddhi and the individual soul, or the individual soul and the highest Self.\n\nHere the purvapakshin maintains that the former of the two stated views is the\nright one, because the two beings are qualified as 'entered into the cave.'\nWhether we understand by the cave the body or the heart, in either case the\nbuddhi and the individual soul may be spoken of as 'entered into the cave.'\nNor would it be appropriate, as long as another interpretation is possible, to\nassume\n\np. 120\n\nthat a special place is here ascribed to the omnipresent Brahman. Moreover,\nthe words 'in the world of their good deeds' show that the two do not pass\nbeyond the sphere of the results of their good works. But the highest Self is\nnot in the sphere of the results of either good or bad works; according to the\nscriptural passage, 'It does not grow larger by works nor does it grow\nsmaller.' Further, the words 'shade and light' properly designate what is\nintelligent and what is non-intelligent, because the two are opposed to each\nother like light and shade. Hence we conclude that the buddhi and the\nindividual soul are spoken of.\n\nTo this we make the following reply:--In the passage under discussion the\nindividual soul (vi _g \xc3\xb1_anatman) and the highest Self are spoken of, because\nthese two, being both intelligent Selfs, are of the same nature. For we see\nthat in ordinary life also, whenever a number is mentioned, beings of the same\nclass are understood to be meant; when, for instance, the order is given,\n'Look out for a second (i.e. a fellow) for this bull,' people look out for a\nsecond bull, not for a horse or a man. So here also, where the mention of the\nfruition of rewards enables us to determine that the individual soul is meant,\nwe understand at once, when a second is required, that the highest Self has to\nbe understood; for the highest Self is intelligent, and therefore of the same\nnature as the soul.--But has it not been said above that the highest Self\ncannot be meant here, on account of the text stating that it is placed in the\ncave?--Well, we reply, _s_ ruti as well as sm _ri_ ti speaks of the highest\nSelf as placed in the cave. Compare, for instance (Ka. Up. I, 2, 12), 'The\nAncient who is hidden in the cave, who dwells in the abyss;' Taitt. Up. II, 1,\n'He who knows him hidden in the cave, in the highest ether;' and, 'Search for\nthe Self entered into the cave.' That it is not contrary to reason to assign\nto the omnipresent Brahman a special locality, for the purpose of clearer\nperception, we have already demonstrated. The attribute of existing in the\nworld of its good works, which properly belongs to one of the two only, viz.\nto the individual soul, may be assigned to both, analogously to the case of\nthe men, one of whom carries an umbrella. Their being compared to light\n\np. 121\n\nand shade also is unobjectionable, because the qualities of belonging and not\nbelonging to this transmigratory world are opposed to each other, like light\nand shade; the quality of belonging to it being due to Nescience, and the\nquality of not belonging to it being real. We therefore understand by the two\n'entered into the cave,' the individual soul and the highest Self.--Another\nreason for this interpretation follows.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 2, 12](sbe34049.htm)\n\n"
