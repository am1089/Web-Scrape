Should it be said that on account of the connected meaning (of the whole\npassage) (the highest Self cannot be meant); (we reply that) it is so, on\naccount of the assertion.\n\nWe now have to refute the objection, made above by the purvapakshin, that the\nhighest Self cannot be meant \'on account of the connected meaning of the\npassage.\'--The Sutrakara remarks, \'It is so, on account of the assertion.\'\nThat means: It is appropriate to understand the passage as referring to the\nhighest Self, because thus the assertion that the Self, previously to the\ncreation, was one only, gives a fully satisfactory sense, while on the other\ninterpretation it would be far from doing so. The creation of the worlds\nrecorded in the Aitareyaka we connect with the creation of the elements\nrecorded in other Vedic texts, in that way that we understand the worlds to\nhave been created subsequently to the elements; just as we showed above (II,\n4, 1) that the passage, \'It sent forth fire,\' must be understood to say that\nthe creation of fire followed on the creation of ether\n\np. 208\n\nand air as known from other texts. For, as proved by us before, particulars\nmentioned in one scriptural text have to be combined with particulars\nmentioned in other texts, if only the chief subject of the passages is the\nsame.--The details about the activity of the Self referred to by the\npurvapakshin have likewise to be understood in such a way as to agree with the\ngeneral matter about which the text desires to make assertions. For we must by\nno means assume that the text is interested in setting forth all the details\nof the story on their own account; the knowledge of them would be in no way\nbeneficial to man. The only thing the text really means to teach is the truth\nthat Brahman is the Self of everything. Hence it first relates how the\ndifferent worlds and the guardians of the worlds, viz. Agni and so on, were\ncreated; explains thereupon the origination of the organs and the body, their\nabode; and shows how the creator having thought, \'How can all this be without\nme?\' (II, 4, 3, 4), entered into this body, \'Opening the suture of the skull\nhe got in by that door\' (7). Then again the text relates how the Self after\nhaving considered the activities of all the organs (\'if speech names,\' &c.; 6)\nasked himself the question, \'What am I?\' and thereupon \'saw this person as the\nwidely spread Brahman\' (10). The aim of all which is to declare that Brahman\nis the universal Self. The same truth is inculcated in a subsequent passage\nalso, viz. II, 6, 1, 5; 6, where the text at first enumerates the whole\naggregate of individual existences together with the elements, and then\ncontinues, \'All this is led by knowledge (i.e. the highest Self); it rests on\nknowledge. The world is led by knowledge, knowledge is its rest, knowledge is\nBrahman."--For all these reasons the view that the highest Brahman is meant in\nthe Aitareyaka is not open to any objections.\n\nThe two preceding Sutras may also be explained with reference to some other\nVedic passages. We read in the Va _g_ asaneyaka (B _ri_. Up. IV, 3, 7), \'Who\nis that Self?--He who is within the heart, surrounded by the pra _n_ as,\nconsisting of knowledge, the person of light.\' Of the Self here first\nmentioned the text goes on to show that it is free from all contact and thus\nproves it to have Brahman\n\np. 209\n\nfor its Self, the concluding statement being, \'This great unborn Self\nundecaying, undying, immortal, fearless is indeed Brahman\' (IV, 4, 25).--In\nthe _Kh_ andogya again we have a chapter in which the introductory statement\ndoes not use the term \'Self (\'Being only this was in the beginning, one,\nwithout a second\'), while at the conclusion the term \'Self\' is used in the\ndeclaration of identity (\'That is the Self. Thou art that\').--A doubt here\narises whether these two scriptural texts treat of the same matter or not.\n\nThey do not, the purvapakshin maintains, since they are not equal. Since the\ndetermination of the sense depends on the letter of the text, we have no right\nto maintain equality of sense where the texts differ. In the Va _g_ asaneyaka\nthe initial statement about the Self shows that the whole passage conveys\ninstruction about the true nature of the Self. In the _Kh_ andogya, on the\nother hand, the initial clause is of a different kind, and we therefore must\nassume that the whole passage imparts instruction differing in nature from\nthat of the Va _g_ asaneyaka.--But has it not been said that the _Kh_ andogya-\npassage also teaches in the end the doctrine of universal identity with the\nSelf?--That has been said indeed (but wrongly); for as the concluding passage\nmust be made to agree with the initial passage (which latter does not say\nanything about the identity of the Self and Brahman), we assume that the\nconcluding passage merely enjoins an imaginative combination (sampatti) of the\nSelf and Brahman.\n\nTo this we reply that also the passage, \'Being only this was in the\nbeginning,\' has to be understood as referring to the Self; \'as other places,\'\ni.e. in the same way as the passage quoted from the Va _g_ asaneyaka. For what\nreason?--\'On account of the subsequent (statement),\' viz. the statement as to\nidentity. And if it be said that \'on account of the connected meaning\' of the\ninitial passage in which no mention is made of the Self, the chapter cannot be\nunderstood to refer to the Self; we reply \'that it may be so understood on\naccount of the assertion\' made in the passage about that \'by which we hear\nwhat is not heard, perceive what is not perceived, know what is not\n\np. 210\n\nknown.\' For this passage asserts that through the knowledge of one thing all\nthings become known, and to make good this assertion the text later on\ndeclares that \'Being only this was,\' &c. Now this knowledge of all things\nthrough one thing is possible only if we understand the passage last quoted to\nrefer to the Self; for if the principal Self were not known, how could all\nthings be known? Moreover the assertion that, before creation, there existed\none thing only, and the reference to the individual soul by means of the word\n\'Self,\' and the statement that in deep sleep the soul becomes united with the\nTrue, and the repeated inquiries on the part of _S_ vetaketu, and the repeated\nassertions, \'Thou art that,\'--all this is appropriate only if the aim of the\nwhole section is not to enjoin an imaginative meditation on all things as\nidentical with the Self, but to teach that the Self really is everything.--Nor\nmust it be said that, in the section under discussion, the concluding passage\nmust be interpreted so as to agree with the introductory clause (and cannot on\nthat account teach anything about the Self); for the introductory passage\ndeclares neither that the Self is everything, nor that the Non-self is\neverything (but merely makes a statement regarding what is in general), and\nsuch an altogether general statement cannot be in conflict with any particular\nstatement made in a supplementary passage, but rather is in want of some such\nparticular statement whereby to define itself 1.--And moreover (to view the\nmatter from a different point of view), the word \'Being\' if looked into\nclosely can denote nothing else but the principal Self, since we have proved,\nunder II, 1, 14, the unreality of the whole aggregate of being different from\nthe Self.--Nor, finally, does a difference of expression necessarily imply a\ndifference of sense; not any more than in ordinary language the to phrases,\n\'Bring that vessel\n\np. 211\n\nover there,\' and, \'That vessel over there, bring it,\' have different meanings.\n--It therefore remains a settled conclusion that in texts such as discussed\nabove, the matter of instruction is the same, however much the mode may vary\nin which the instruction is conveyed.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[210:1](sbe38160.htm#fr_138) I.e. the definite statement about the Self in the\nconcluding passage may be used for defining the sense of the indefinite\ninitial statement about that which is. \'That which is\' comprises the Self as\nwell as the Not-Self.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 3, 18](sbe38161.htm)\n\n'
