Any one devoted to these will obtain the state which is above the\nMaya,"\n\nSamadhi is many stages, but any Samadhi can destroy the enemy death, and bring\none to the Divine State of Supreme Bliss.\n\nWhen the Prana (Vital or Life Force) and mind are controlled, a state of\nharmony arises--that is Samadhi. As salt thrown in water becomes one with the\nwater, so the controlled mind becomes one with Atma--that is Samadhi.\n\n"Those who really understand the greatness of Yoga, and obtain it thru\npractice, and by the help of a kind Guru, are emancipated.\n\n"Understanding of Wisdom, and directly realizing the one Atma as Parabrahma\n(Universal Soul) is emancipation, and it gives power over all of Nature\'s\nforces--known as Sidhis and Anima."\n\n"Without the help of a Spiritual teacher, and without sincere effort of the\nstudent, the real realization of Truth, and the state of\n\np. 73\n\nSamadhi cannot be attained by the student."\n\n"When a Yogi has awakened the Kundalini (Mother God) by practicing the Mudras,\nthen Prana moves thru the Sushumna, and having aroused all the Chakras, the\nYogi arises above all Karma, and is then freed from cause and effect;--that\nstate is Samadhi.\n\n"The mind is the cause of Karma; when the mind and Prana (its moving power) is\ncontrolled by daily practice of Mudras. then the lower mental activity ceases.\nThe higher self then manifests. Yogi attains the unchanging state. He is\nmaster over time, matter and space;--that state is Samadhi. When the mind is\npoised, the Prana moves in the Sushumna, and real realization is obtained. Why\nshould one fear death, as they are above decay and death? No one can attain\nwisdom as long as the Prana and mind are not controlled. He who controls the\nPrana and mind attain liberation.\n\n"Many say liberation can be only attained by Wisdom; then what is the use of\nYoga?" The Siva answered: "A battle is won by a sword; but what is the use of\na sword without a warrior and valor? So both are needed." "Those great men and\nwomen have attained pure wisdom and liberation\n\np. 74\n\nhave not practiced Yoga, have they?" "They have practiced Yoga in their past\nlives."\n\nI will drop this matter here as I do not want to prove or spend any time on\nthe past. My object is to show how to awaken the Kundalini and reach the\nblessed state of Samadhi.\n\nThe human body has a great number of Nadis, the three main ones,--Ida and Pin-\ngala on each side of the spine, the Sushumna in the middle. The Prana moves\nthru the Ida and Pingala only; the Sushumna being closed. When Yogi learns the\nsecret of controlling the Prana and Apana, then he can awaken the Kundalini,\nand force the Prana to go thru the Sushumna. When this has been accomplished--\nSamadhi follows. All other means are waste of time. Thus Yogi should not\nfollow other means if he desires to awaken the Kundalini and reach Samadhi.\n\nThe mind is made to move by two things, the Prana and desire. If Prana is\ncontrolled, desire is also controlled. Therefore, the Prana and mind are as\none. As long as the mind is not mastered, so long the senses are not mastered.\nWhen the three are controlled, then the Yoga can hold them on any Chakra, and\nawaken or move the Kundalini. By\n\np. 75\n\ncontrol of the Prana and mind the Yogi gains strength; by this strength he\narises above all diseases. So Yogi should practice Pranayama and the Mudras to\nmaster Prana.\n\nThe mind is the master of the organs of sense, the Prana is the master of the\nmind. When the Prana and the mind are under control the Yogi attains blessed\npeace, which can only be known by experience.\n\nThe lower mind is ignorance itself. When the mind is controlled, ignorance,\nwhich is the Mother of Maya (illusion), dies. The Yogi attains Samadhi or the\nstate of Brahma.\n\nEvery one wishes to attain the Laya Yoga, but it is difficult to attain. To do\nso the Shambhavi Mudra is the best to practice. This Mudra cannot be attained\nuntil the Prana and the mind are controlled; then Shambhavi Mudra should be\npracticed as it raises the Yogi above time, matter, space and ether. He\ncontrols the power of nature\'s forces, as levitation and walking on water, and\nhe can live as long as he desires. but this is not the object of the Hindu\nYogis. Their object is not to attain wonderful powers. but Seedless Samadhi--\nthe Brahmic state--which is\n\np. 76\n\nabove all other states; it is divine peace and common to all.\n\nWhen the Yogi succeeds in controlling Prana, from the Ida and Pingala Nadis,\nand makes it go thru the Sushumna, he has reached the state wherein he\nexperiences TRUTH, which is the Light of Lights, and is the Source of All.\nThis is the goal of all.\n\nYogis practice different Mudras to control Prana. When Prana is controlled and\nmade to move thru the Sushumna, the state of Samadhi follows. This is the\ncorrect method When Yogi desires to cheat death and time, he raises the Prana\nup to the Ajna Chakra, placing the Prana and the mind in the\n[Kundalini](errata.htm#16), then by steady meditation Yogi moves the\nKundalini. He then places the Atma in the Brahma and Brahma in the\n[Atma](errata.htm#17). He is then in Samadhi--ALL in ALL.\n\nThe external worlds are created by the lower mind. By controlling the lower\nmind, the external world is finished. Then meditating on the One Reality, the\nYogi becomes that Reality or Brahma. He is not affected by matter, space or\ntime. He is above all.\n\nAll things in the world are perceived by mind. When the mind is controlled\nthere remains no duality. When the mind is merged\n\np. 77\n\nin the Atma, that state is the Absolute, and is Satchitanada (truth, wisdom,\nbliss).\n\n"Salutation to Sushumna, to the Kundalini, to the Stream of Nectar flowing\nfrom the Moon".\n\nThe Nada Practice:\n\nThe Great Yogin Garakhnath has given out the practice of Nada to help those\nwho are unable to realize the pure truth.\n\nThe Yogi should sit in the Sidhasan and practice the Shambhavi Mudra, and\nshould listen with fixed mind to the sound of the self, which will be heard in\nthe right side of the head. The sounds will be ten--from the ocean roar to a\nvery subtle sound--but Yogi should keep the mind fixed on Nada which is the\ngoal. When the Yogi is sitting in Sidhasan practicing Shambhavi with Yoni\nMudra, he should force the Prana to the heart center, as the sound begins\nthere. When Prana becomes one with the Nada, then the Yogi should move it to\nthe Vishudha Chakra. As soon as Yogi succeeds in taking the Nada with Prana to\nthe Vishudha Chakra, he will become like Devas, and the Brahmanada (Divine\nBliss) will surely follow.\n\np. 78\n\nFrom the Vishudha Chakra Yogi should forcibly take the Prana and the Nada to\nthe Ajna Chakra. This is the source of all Sidhis. Reaching here the Yogi\ncontrols all the finer forces of nature and mental knowledge. He arises above\nnature\'s elements and mind, and is one with Atma, above the world\'s miseries.\nHis mind is listening to the inner sound of the Nada.--it is the blessed joy\nthat can be known by one who has attained that state.\n\nOne state more remains for the Yogi; that is going up from the Ajna Chakra to\nthe Sir Chakra or the Thousand Petal Lotus. In Yogi will hear the sound of\nflutes. He has this Lotus, Yogi will hear the sound of flutes. He has then\nreached the highest state of Bliss. He is equal to God, as he can create and\ndestroy any material thing, if he so wishes. But creation and destruction are\nnot the object of the Yogi; he wants to be liberated, and in this State he is\nliberation itself.\n\n"Practice of Nada is most easy, even a feeble minded person can succeed by\ndaily practice. The practitioner will soon start to feel the joy that arises\nby the Nada in the heart. That joy cannot be explained by words as it is\nDivine Joy, above the reach of\n\np. 79\n\nmental knowledge.\n\nSick and suffering humanity should practice Shambhavi, that they could hear\nthe Nada sound, or the Inner Voice.\n\n"Benefits to the students that practice Nada--as soon as their mind forms the\nhabits of listening to the inner sound of the Nada, it will never be disturbed\nby external sounds. By daily practice of Nada, the mind becomes firm and\nattracted by Nada,--it surely becomes one with Nada. As the sharp goad is best\nto control the mad elephant, so the Nada is best to control the mind. The Nada\nholds the mind fixed, as a bird cannot fly without wings. Those Yogis who have\nmastered the Nada practice are never disturbed by any other sound; they are\nliberated and emancipated."--H. Y. [Pradipika](errata.htm#18).\n\nYogi in Samadhi does not feel pain, thirst, hunger, heat or cold, nothing can\nharm him, his body does not decay, death never comes, near him. He is equal to\nGod.\n\nThe Following is taken from The Yoga Aphorisms.--Chapter III--IV.\n\nTranslation and Commentary by\n\nSWAMI VIVEKANANDA\n\np. 80\n\n1\\. Dharana is holding the mind on to some particular object.\n\n2--An unbroken flow of knowledge in that object is Dhyana.\n\n3--When that, giving up all forms, reflects only the meaning, it is Samadhi.\n\n4--(These) three (when practiced) in regard to one object is Samyama.\n\n5--By the conquest of that comes light of knowledge.\n\nWhen one has succeeded in making this Samyama, all powers come under his\ncontrol. This is the great instrument of the Yogi. The objects of knowledge\nare infinite, and they are divided into the gross, grosser, grossest, and the\nfine, finer, finest, and so on. This Samyama should be first applied to gross\nthings, and when you begin to get knowledge of this gross, slowly, by stages.\nit should be brought to finer things.\n\n6--That should be employed in stages.\n\nThis is a note of warning not to attempt to go too fast.\n\n15--The succession of changes is the cause of manifold evolution.\n\n16--By making Samyama on the three sorts of changes comes the knowledge of\npast and future.\n\nWe must not lose sight of the first definition of Samyama. When the mind has\nattained to that state when\n\np. 81\n\nit identifies itself with the internal impression of the object, leaving the\nexternal, and when, by long practice, that is retained by the mind, and the\nmind can get into that state in a moment, that is Samyama. If a man in that\nstate wants to know the past and future he has to make a Samyama on the\nchanges in the Samskaras (111. 13). Some are working now at present, some have\nworked out, and some are waiting to work; so by marking a Samyama on these he\nknows the past and future.\n\n21--By making Samyama on the form of the body, the perceptibility of the form\nbeing obstructed, and the power of manifestation in the eye being separated,\nthe Yogi\'s body becomes unseen.\n\nA Yogi standing in the midst of this room can apparently vanish. He does not\nreally vanish, but he will not be seen by any one. The form and the body are,\nas it were, separated. You must remember that this can only be done when the\nYogi has attained to that power of concentration when form and the thing\nformed have been separated. Then he makes a Samyama on that, and the power to\nperceive forms is obstructed, because the power of perceiving forms comes from\nthe junction of form and the thing formed.\n\n25--By making Samyama on the strength of the elephant, and others, their\nrespective strength comes to the Yogi.\n\nWhen a Yogi has attained to this Samyama and wants strength, he makes a\nSamyama on the strength of the elephant, and gets it. Infinite energy is at\nthe disposal\n\np. 82\n\nof every one, if he only knows how to get it. The Yogi has discovered the\nscience of getting it.\n\n26--By making Samyama on the effulgent light, (1.36) comes the knowledge of\nthe fine, the obstructed and the remote.\n\nWhen the Yogi makes Samyama on that effulgent light in the heart he sees\nthings, which are very remote, things for instance, that are happening in a\ndistant place, and which are obstructed by mountain barriers, and also things\nwhich are very fine.\n\n39--When the cause of bondage of the Chitta has become loosened, the Yogi, by\nhis knowledge of its channels of activity (the nerves), enters another\'s body.\n\nThe Yogi can enter a dead body, and make it get up and move, even while he\nhimself is working in another body. Or he can enter a living body, and hold\nthat man\'s mind and organs in check, and for the time being act thru the body\nof that man. That is done by the Yogi coming to this discrimination of Purusha\nand nature. If he wants to enter another\'s body he makes a Samyama on that\nbody and enters it, because, not only is-his Soul omnipresent, but his mind\nalso, as the Yogi teaches. It is one bit of the universal mind. Now, however,\nit can only work thru the nerve currents in this body, but when the Yogi has\nloosened himself from these nerve currents. he can work thru other things.\n\n41--By the conquest of the current Samana he is surrounded by a blaze of\nlight.\n\np. 83\n\n[paragraph continues] Whenever he likes light flashes from his body.\n\n42--By making Samyama on the relation between the ear and the Akasa comes\ndivine hearing.\n\nThere is the Akasa, the ether, and the instrument, the ear. By making Samyama\non them the Yogi gets supernormal hearing; he hears everything. Anything\nspoken or sounded miles away he can hear.\n\n43--By making Samyama on the relation between the Akasa and the body and\nbecoming light as cotton-wool, etc., through meditation on them, the Yogi goes\nthrough the skies.\n\nThis Akasa is the material of this body; it is only Akasa in a certain form\nthat has become the body. If the Yogi makes a Samyama on this Akasa material\nof his body, it acquires the lightness of Akasa, and he can go anywhere\nthrough the air. So in the other case also.\n\n44--By making Samyama on the \'real modification\' of the mind, outside of body,\ncalled great this disembodiedness, comes disappearance of the covering to\nlight.\n\nThe mind in its foolishness thinks that it is working in this body. Why should\nI be bound by one system of nerves, and put the Ego only in one body, if the\nmind is omnipresent? There is no reason why I should. The YOGI wants to feel\nthe Ego wherever he likes. The mental waves which arise in the absence of\negoism in the body are called \'real modifications\' or \'great disembodiedness.\'\nWhen he has succeeded in making SAMYAMA on these modifications, all covering\nto light goes away, and all darkness and ignorance vanish. Everything appears\nto him to be full of knowledge.\n\np. 84\n\n45\\. By making Samyama on the gross and fine forms of the elements, their\nessential traits, the inherence of the Gunas in them and on their contributing\nto the experience of the soul, comes mastery of the elements.\n\n46--From that comes minuteness, and the rest of the powers, \'glorification of\nthe body\' and indestructibleness of the bodily qualities.\n\nThis means that the Yogi has attained the eight powers. He can make himself as\nminute as a particle, or as huge as a mountain, as heavy as the earth, or as\nlight as the air; he can reach anything he likes, he can rule everything he\nwants, he can conquer everything he wants, and so on. A lion will sit at his\nfeet like a lamb, and all his desires be fulfilled at will.\n\n47--The \'glorification of the body\' is beauty, complexion, strength, admantine\nhardness.\n\nThe body becomes indestructible. Nothing can injure it. Nothing can destroy it\nuntil the Yogi wishes. "Breaking the rod of time he lives in this universe\nwith his body". In the Vedas it is written that for that man there is no more\ndisease, death or pain.\n\n52--The Yogi should not feel allured or\n\np. 85\n\nflattered by the overtures of celestial beings, for fear of evil again.\n\nThere are other dangers too; gods and other beings come to tempt the Yogi.\nThey do not want anyone to be perfectly free. They are jealous, just as we\nare, and worse than us sometimes. They are very much afraid of losing their\nplaces. Those Yogis who do not reach perfection die and become gods; leaving\nthe direct road they go into one of the side streets, and get these powers.\nThen again they have to be born; but he who is strong enough to withstand\nthese temptations, and go straight to the goal, becomes free.\n\n1--The Siddhis (powers) are attained by birth, chemical means, power of words,\nmortification or concentration.\n\nSometimes a man is born with the Siddhis, powers, of course those he had\nearned in his previous incarnation. This time he is born, as it were, to enjoy\nthe fruits of them. It is said of Kapila, the great father of the Sankhya\nPhilosophy, that he was a born Siddha, which means, literally, a man who has\nattained to success.\n\nThe Yogis claim that these powers can be gained by chemical means. All of you\nknow that chemistry originally began as alchemy; men went in search of the\nphilosopher\'s stone and elixirs of life, and so forth. In India there was a\nsect called the Rasayanas. Their idea was that ideality, knowledge,\nspirituality and religion, were all very right, but that the body was the only\ninstrument by which to attain to all these. If the body came to an end every\nnow and again it would take so much more time to attain to the goal. For\ninstance, a man wants to practice Yoga, or wants to become spiritual. Before\nhe has\n\np. 86\n\nadvanced very far he dies. Then he takes another body and begins again, then\ndies, and so on. In this way much time will be lost in dying and being born\nagain. If the body could be made strong and perfect, so that it would get rid\nof birth and death, we should have so much more time to become spiritual. So\nthese Rasayanas say, first make the body very strong. They claim that this\nbody can be made immortal. Their idea is that if the mind manufactures the\nbody, and if it be true that each mind is only one outlet to the infinite\nenergy, there should be no limit to each outlet getting any amount of power\nfrom outside. Why is it impossible to keep our bodies all the time? We have to\nmanufacture all the bodies that we ever have. As coon as this body dies we\nshall have to manufacture another. If we can do that, why cannot we do it just\nhere and now, without getting out of the present body? The theory is perfectly\ncorrect. If it is possible that we live after death, and make other bodies,\nwhy is it impossible that we should have the power of making bodies here,\nwithout entirely dissolving this body, simply changing it continually? They\nalso thought that in mercury and in sulphur was hidden the most wonderful\npower, and that by certain preparations of these a man could keep the body as\nlong as he liked. Others believed that certain drugs could bring powers, such\nas flying thru the air. Many of the most wonderful medicines of the present\nday we owe to the Rasayanas, notably the use of metals in medicine. Certain\nsects of Yogis claim that many of their principal teachers are still living in\ntheir old bodies.
