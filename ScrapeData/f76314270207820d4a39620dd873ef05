CORRECTIVE POSES OF YOGA\n\nThe first section of this book discussed the mental, or psychological,\napproach to Yoga. As you apply the earlier lessons to mental relaxation, you\nmust also bring your body to a state in which it will support your efforts to\nattain full contentment, relaxation and ease. Ancient teachers of scientific\nYoga realized, as do modern physicians, that proper carriage of the body is\nessential for mental and physical health. You will note that on the following\npages there is very little reference to the Sanskrit philosophy of Yoga, for\nhere we put aside the mind and devote our attention to the body. As you assume\nthese postures, however, keep in mind the eight principles of Raja Yoga. They\nwill help you in dealing with both mind and body as you practice Yoga.\n\nAt first, spend only as much time on each exercise as you can without feeling\nfatigued. As the timbre of your body improves and as your mind takes fuller\ncontrol of your body, you will find it possible to remain in any pose for\nlonger and longer periods. One of the most prevalent causes of sluggishness\nand disturbance of the digestive organs is faulty carriage of the body,\nespecially above the waist, involving the spinal\n\np. 30\n\nand abdominal muscles. Practically all of us are victims of faulty posture and\nsuffer from enteroptosis, a condition in which the stomach, intestines and\nvery often the kidneys, liver and pelvic organs, are dragged downwards and\nremain permanently out of their correct anatomical positions.\n\nMedical internists will verify the statement that poor carriage retards\ncirculation of large blood vessels. An habitual slouching position causes the\nblood of the abdomen to stagnate in the liver, inducing a feeling of\ndespondency and confusion, as well as headache, accompanied by coldness of the\nhands and feet, chronic fatigue and often constipation. The Yoga Institute in\nBombay has traced varied disorders of the digestive and pelvic organs and even\nfunctional defects of the heart and lungs directly to poor posture habits.\nPersons who had been [approaching](errata.htm#0) invalidity as a result of\nposture habits are said to have been cured after a few weeks of training.\nPersons in normal health have gained markedly, physically and mentally, from a\nshort, but regular, corrective posture program.\n\nThe proper pose of the body imparts graceful curves to the female figure and\nan air of strength to the male. The proper posture, as imparted by Yoga,\nembodies in beauty the feelings of triumph and self-respect, whatever the age\nor condition of the practitioner. The common drooped and slouching position is\nboth ugly and unhealthy, and invariably reflects a degenerated mental\nattitude.\n\nAncient Yogis were perhaps first to recognize the influence of carriage on\nhealth of the mind and body. The prime objective of posture in Yoga is not\nmystic, mysterious or magic, but the achievement of physical ease and poise.\nAn erect posture is recommended to maintain free spinal circulation during\nprolonged sitting and concentration.\n\np. 31\n\n#### The First Lesson in Yoga Posture\n\nWhen beginning the practice of Yoga postures, start with the simple prayer\npose in a standing position. Medical investigation shows that many corrective\nand therapeutic benefits stem from even these first simple poses. It is no\nlonger known whether the ancient Yogins, the founders of Yoga, attached any\nspecial mystical significance to these first poses. However, they are\nexcellent poses for prayer and meditation.\n\n#### Stitha-Prarthanasana, or Prayer Pose\n\nThis pose helps to achieve steadiness through gradual control of voluntary\nmuscular movements and offers, through steadiness, the best physical attitude\nfor standing prayer; it permits normal standing posture by coordinating\nskeletal muscles and it corrects postural defects.\n\nWhile standing, hold your body as tall as possible without actually rising on\nyour toes. Keep your heels together, placing all your weight upon the balls of\nyour feet. Throw your head and chest up, shoulder blades flat. The abdominal\nmuscles should be deflated at their lower part, but not drawn inward, and\nfuller just below the ribs, while the pelvis should be tilted at such an angle\nas to prevent any exaggeration of the lumbar curve. Your knees must be\nstraight but not stiff, with legs together touching at the knees. Fold your\nhands over the sternum; avoid tension. Relax your mind and fix your eyes on\nany pleasing object before you.\n\nIn this position, the thorax is full and round; the diaphragm is high; the\nabdomen at its greatest length. The stomach and intestinal viscera are held in\nproper place and the pelvic organs are relieved of pressures from above. There\nis a partial relaxation of the larger muscles and relief from\n\np. 32\n\n[![Stitha-Prarthanasana, or Prayer Pose](tn/03200.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/03200.jpg)  \nStitha-Prarthanasana, or Prayer Pose  \n\np. 33\n\ntension. With the arms relaxed and let down at the sides, it is an ideal\nposition for standing. Maintain this position for about one minute, breathing\nnormally. Keep your mind free and observe complete silence. Turn slowly to\neither side, parallel to a wall or post, and notice whether you sway. Swaying\nis an indication of nervous disturbance which must be overcome.\n\nIf possible, practice opposite a mirror, where swaying motions can be noted.\nDuring the period of test and correction, keep your eyes half-closed, allowing\njust enough vision for observation, and concentrate on the parts of your body\nabove the waist. Stand immobile as a statue, and as soon as you have a\ntendency to sway, check it by will power. After the first few weeks, try to\nsustain this motionless pose for two to three minutes, always breathing\nnormally. This pose is best practiced in the morning, and should be followed\ndaily until complete control has been achieved. Afterwards, it may be\npracticed once weekly.\n\n#### Ekapadasana, or One-Leg Pose\n\nBegin by assuming the Prayer Pose. Bend down, lift one leg with your hands and\nbring it up to the thigh. Keep your balance on the other leg. If you\nexperience the fear of falling, stand and practice near a wall or window sill\nor other support. After you have attained sufficient steadiness on one leg,\nadjust the raised leg by pressing the heel tightly against the opposite groin,\nwith the sole of the foot against the opposite thigh. Study the illustration\n(page 34) for details of this pose.\n\nSteadiness, or nerve control and coordination between muscular and nervous\nsystems, is one of the prime goals of Yoga physical education, and must be\nlearned in slow stages. At first it may be necessary to use some support to\nmaintain\n\np. 34\n\n[![Ekapadasana, or One-Leg Pose](tn/03400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/03400.jpg)  \nEkapadasana, or One-Leg Pose  \n\nbalance. Later you will be able to practice without support, maintaining this\npose with your hands in the prayer posture. It may be difficult to keep this\npose for more than a few seconds at the beginning, but you should gradually be\nable to extend the duration of time until you can keep the pose comfortably\nfor two or three minutes. Do not overdo at first. Limit practice to one or two\nminutes mornings and evenings, alternating legs.\n\np. 35\n\nIn addition to exercising and relaxing the muscles and nerves of alternate\nlegs, this pose helps to develop the nerve control necessary for relaxation.\nWhen swaying is experienced during this exercise, the best corrective is to\nconcentrate your mind on each of your movements. Become consciously aware of\nthe most insignificant variations in steadiness, so that you will be able to\nsecure control over all motion. Along with other Yoga measures\xc2\x97meditation,\ndiet, etc.\xc2\x97this posture facilitates nerve control in the course of a few\nmonths.\n\n#### Padmasana, or Lotus Pose\n\nThe traditional meditative posture, the Padmasana, or Lotus Pose, is essential\nfor posture training, body-free meditation and preserving normal elasticity of\nthe muscles connected with the pelvis and lower extremities. As noted\npreviously, those who have been raised in the Western culture are stiff and\nlack flexibility in their legs and lower bodies. This must be corrected in\norder to restore natural suppleness of the limbs. The Lotus Pose may at first\nbe a bit difficult, but with regular practice, massage of the limbs and\ndetermination, it can be achieved. Avoid undue strain and do not force\nyourself into this by violent jerks or tension of your legs. When you are\nready for it, your body will fall naturally into the desired posture.\n\nNow that you have begun the sitting and the lying-down exercises, you should\navoid the use of a bare floor. If the room in which you are practicing is not\ncarpeted, provide yourself with a soft mat at least 6 x 3 feet, and spread a\nclean sheet over the area where you will sit or lie.\n\np. 36\n\n[![Padmasana, or Lotus Pose](tn/03600.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/03600.jpg)  \nPadmasana, or Lotus Pose  \n\n[![Ardha-Padmasana, or Semi-Lotus Pose](tn/03601.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/03601.jpg)  \nArdha-Padmasana, or Semi-Lotus Pose  \n\np. 37\n\n#### Ardha-Padmasana, or Semi-Lotus Pose\n\nBeginning with the Lotus Pose, sit on the floor with your legs stretched out.\nBend the right leg slowly and fold it upon itself. Using your hands, place the\nright heel at the root of the thigh so that its sole is turned upwards and\nyour foot is stretched over the left groin. Similarly, bend the left leg and\nfold it upon itself with your hands, placing the left heel over the root of\nthe right thigh. Your ankles should cross each other, while your heel-ends\ntouch closely. The left foot with its upturned sole should lie fully stretched\nover the right groin. Keep your knees pressed to the ground, feet tight\nagainst the thighs, and press your heels firmly against the upper front margin\nof the pubic bone slightly above the sex organs.\n\nTo complete this pose, hold your body erect, with neck straight, chest thrown\nforward and abdomen drawn moderately inwards. Fix your eyes on any object in\nfront of you, then close them. Spread your left hand with its back touching\nboth heels, palm upwards. Place your right hand over the left in the same\nmanner. The ancient texts associate this pose with peace. Although many find\nit easier to achieve the pose by folding the left leg first, you may alternate\nthe position of your legs.\n\nA highly effective meditative posture, the Semi-Lotus Pose offers many\ncorrective and cultural benefits. It results in either extension, flexion or\nrelaxation to almost all the important muscles, ligaments and tendons of the\nlower limbs. It also induces increased blood circulation in the abdominal and\ngenital areas by blocking the flow in some areas and drawing a larger supply\nof blood from the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta. Restraint of the general\ncirculation\n\np. 38\n\ncaused by the pressure of the heels provides an increased supply of blood to\nthe sex organs and also helps to tone the various nerve centers located in the\npelvic region, such as the chain of coccygeal and sacral nerves.\n\nRespiration is improved as a result of the chest being thrown forward and the\nabdomen being held in normal position. Muscle tone is increased in the\ninternal organs, especially those of the intestinal tract. In this posture, it\nis important that the shoulders should not sag forward, crowding the chest,\nnor should the upper part of the body crowd down upon the stomach and the\nabdominal viscera. The Lotus Pose is suggested for the regulation of breath\nmovements.\n\n#### Yastikasana, or Stick Pose\n\nThis is a recent addition to the traditional _asanas_ , or poses. Developed in\nthe 19th century by Yoga practitioners, it is believed to increase the height\nof the user. While this benefit may be questioned, the pose induces a state of\ncomplete relaxation. An all-body stretch which does not strain even the novice\nin Yoga, this pose is most easily held while lying down.\n\nTo take this pose, harmonize your breathing with your actions. Lie on your\nback on a comfortable mat or carpet, with your legs and arms fully extended.\nFall into a relaxed position. Inhale for three seconds and, while retaining\nyour breath, stretch your body slowly to full length. Your toes and fingers\nshould point outwards, as if trying to reach an object beyond their grasp.\nRepeat this stretch position for three seconds and then release the tension of\nthe stretch\n\np. 39\n\n[![Yastikasana, or Stick Pose](tn/03900.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/03900.jpg)  \nYastikasana, or Stick Pose  \n\nwhile exhaling. Any maximum stretching of the body should be attempted only\nwhile the breath is retained. Do not attempt to hold your breath for more than\nfour or five seconds.\n\nTo simplify the explanation of the Yastikasana movements: (1) With body\nsupine, arms and legs outstretched, inhale for three seconds; (2) while your\nbody is outstretched, hold your breath for three seconds; (3) return to the\nstarting position; exhale for three seconds. Repeat the entire exercise five\ntimes in one minute.\n\nThe primary object of this posture is to stretch the body fully. It serves to\ncorrect faulty postural habits and tenses the usually relaxed abdominal and\npelvic muscles.\n\nAccording to the schools of Yoga which have utilized the Stick Pose,\nstretching aids height and its regular practice will at least halt the\ntendency of the aging to lose height. It may be done both in the morning and\nin the evening. Where it is used solely for relaxation, normal, rhythmic\nbreathing should be maintained without any effort at stretching.\n\np. 40\n\n[![Parvatasana, or Mountain Pose](tn/04000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/04000.jpg)  \nParvatasana, or Mountain Pose  \n\n#### Parvatasana, or Mountain Pose\n\nOverweight can bring both mental and physical problems. The posture known as\nParvatasana, or the Mountain Pose, has been found in several Yoga institutes\nto be highly effective in maintaining slimness and in correcting minor\npostural defects of the spinal cord.\n\nAssuming the Semi-Lotus Pose, slowly raise your hands upward and above the\nhead. Keep your palms pressed together. If it is easier, interlace your\nfingers. Finally, stretch upward as if to touch some object directly above\nyour head. Keep your arms close to your ears, your head erect, your back\nstraight, and pull your abdomen in. While inhaling, raise the upper part of\nyour body to its maximum height. Make sure your elbows and wrists are in a\nstraight line.\n\np. 41\n\nMaintain this slightly stretched, upright position between breaths, since this\nis the point at which attempts at upward stretching are most successful.\nDuring this exercise, keep your eyes fixed on some object before you and keep\nyour mind at ease. This pose was named Parvatasana because it has the\nappearance of a mountain.\n\nFor maximum benefits, the movements and breathing should be in harmony with\nactions as shown in the following instructions: (1) In a sitting pose, raise\narms and inhale for three seconds; (2) maintain pose and try to retain breath\nfor six seconds; (3) return to starting position, exhale for three seconds.\nRepeat this pose five times to a minute without pausing.\n\nThis posture tenses and pulls all the abdominal and pelvic muscles,\nstrengthens and straightens the muscles of the back and also stretches and\nexercises the usually inactive waist zone. One of its most evident benefits\nwill be the reduction of fat and flabby abdominal tissue. However, it must be\nfollowed consistently for one minute, both in the morning and evening.\n\n#### Variations of the Parvatasana Pose\n\nThere are four dynamic variations of this pose. They are: (1) Swaying forward;\n(2) leaning backward; (3) bending to the right; (4) bending to the left. These\nvariations should be utilized during a six-second breathing pause. Instead of\nmaintaining the perpendicular position while stretching, vary it by making the\nmovements on the four sides and alternately. Gradually increase the retention\nof your breath to nine seconds, which will permit four movements to a minute.\nThe purpose of the variations is to provide additional\n\np. 42\n\n[![Variations of the Parvatasana Pose: forward, backward, right and\nleft.](tn/04200.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/04200.jpg)  \nVariations of the Parvatasana Pose: forward, backward, right and left.  \n\np. 43\n\nstretching of all sets of muscles in the trunk. They also massage the internal\norgans just below the ribs and the abdominal muscles.\n\n#### Trikonasana, or Triangle Pose\n\nThe Trikonasana will enable you to reach a state of physical suppleness and\nelasticity that will have a relaxing effect on your mental state. It is more\ndifficult at first than the earlier poses, as it calls upon ordinarily\nunexercised muscles. Because of the exceptionally straight and full-length\nadjustments of the bony structure of the spine, this pose will correct many of\nthe ailments due to misplaced internal organs and poor body tonicity. The\ndynamic variations of this pose will enhance its benefits considerably.\n\nStand erect with your feet together and arms down at your sides. Slowly exhale\nwhile bending downward; keep your legs straight. Lower only the upper part of\nthe body. Keep your legs perfectly straight and pressed backwards. Now, touch\nyour toes with the tips of your fingers, keeping your arms straight, with\nspine and neck horizontal, abdomen in, head thrown forward, and your eyes\nfixed on the tip of your nose. Maintain this pose as illustrated on the next\npage, then return to the original position while inhaling. Your movements and\ntiming should be as follows: (1) Touch toes and exhale for three seconds; (2)\nkeep pose and hold breath for six seconds; (3) return to starting position and\ninhale for three seconds. Repeat five times in one minute without pausing.\n\nDo not become discouraged if you fail to touch your toes on the first attempt.\nTry each day until you can hold the pose comfortably. Work into this pose\ngradually, avoiding attempts to force your body into it by jerks or sudden\n\np. 44\n\n[![Trikonasana, or Triangle Pose](tn/04400.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/04400.jpg)  \nTrikonasana, or Triangle Pose  \n\npulling of muscles. Before working for other refinements of the pose, aim to\ntouch your toes. If you should find yourself feeling muscle tenderness, try a\nwarm massage to alleviate the discomfort.\n\nA dynamic variation of the Triangle Pose is fairly simple. Stand with your\nfeet twenty-four inches apart and, while inhaling, raise one arm and bend it\nlaterally on the opposite\n\np. 45\n\nside, sliding the other arm lengthwise. When the complete lateral stretch is\nachieved, retain your breath and return to the original position. Repeat the\nlateral stretch on the other side.\n\nMovements, breathing and timing should be as follows: (1) Bend sideward;\ninhale for three seconds; (2) keep pose and retain breath for six seconds; (3)\nreturn to normal position and exhale for three seconds. Repeat alternately,\nwithout pausing, ten times in two minutes.\n\nFor best effects, the exercise should be practiced for at least one minute.\nHowever, persons with poor physical tone and those with a history of\ncirculatory or respiratory ailments should try it only in moderation, for\nabout ten seconds at one time.\n\n[![Variations of the Triangle Pose](tn/04500.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/04500.jpg)  \nVariations of the Triangle Pose  \n\np. 46\n\n#### Garudasana, or Eagle Pose\n\nAnother cause of both physical and mental tenseness is a lack of suppleness\nand elasticity in joints and extremities. Correctives for this are postures\ninvolving fairly simple body twists. The purposeful twisting of the\nextremities may be accomplished through the Garudasana.\n\n[![Garudasana, or Eagle Pose](tn/04600.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/04600.jpg)  \nGarudasana, or Eagle Pose  \n\np. 47\n\nStand erect as shown in the illustration. Lift either leg (the alternate use\nof each leg will follow), and twist the same leg both near the hip joint and\nthe knee. Then twine one leg around the other. Adjust the twists very\ncarefully without strain or muscle tension. Lock the ankle with the toe of the\nother twisted leg and hold it there as a safety against possible accidental\nrelease. Do this while exhaling. When you are balanced on one leg, make an\neffort to keep the body straight, and gradually increase the pressure of the\ntoe-hold near the opposite ankle until the greatest possible twist is\nachieved.\n\nAt first, practice only the leg twist while retaining your breath. After the\nfirst week or so, when this becomes easier, try the arm and hand twists by\ntwining one arm around the other (alternating arms). Twist the hands from the\nwrists and press the palms against each other. Try to keep\n\n[![](tn/04700.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/04700.jpg)\n\np. 48\n\nthe pose for several seconds and, while inhaling, return to the original\nposition.\n\nDo not force yourself into this pose until your limbs have gained sufficient\nsuppleness. Then you should follow this time-plan: (1) Twist your body and\nexhale for five seconds; (2) maintain the pose as shown in the illustration\nand retain your breath for ten seconds (or you may with normal, rhythmic\nbreathing hold the pose for not more than two minutes); (3) return to starting\nposition and inhale for five seconds.\n\nIt is advised that this posture be repeated alternately three times on each\nside for a two-minute period, preferably in the morning. Note that in the\nGarudasana you should avoid straining while twisting. Practice it by gradual\nstages before attempting to follow the full exercise.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 6.
