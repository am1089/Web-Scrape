Modes of Proof.\n\n* 68. Those invested with legal authority must pay strict attention to the (various) modes of proof. That even which is provable fails to be proved, if the (prescribed) modes of proof are not attended to.\n\n69. 69 Documents, witnesses, and possession are the traditional three means of proof, by which a creditor endeavouring to recover his loan may obtain what he has lent.\n\n70. 70 If the Creator had not created writing as an\n\np. 59\n\nexcellent eye (as it were), the affairs of this whole world would not take\ntheir proper course.\n\n71\\. Writing is an excellent eye (as it were), because it solves all doubts\nwhich may have arisen in regard to place, time, profit, matter, quantity, or\nstipulated period.\n\n72\\. He who, having received a chattel in a certain place, tries to deny the\nfact, is liable to be confronted with witnesses and convicted, difficult as it\nmay be to prove his guilt.\n\n73\\. A document is subject to many blemishes; witnesses are neither exempt\nfrom old age nor from death; possession, which has been continually held, is\nthe only sure mode of proof, as it is not connected with any material object\n(liable to decay).\n\n74\\. Thus have these three modes of proof been declared, by means of which a\ncreditor may recover an outstanding debt, which has not been paid to him and\ncalled into doubt (by the debtor).\n\n75. 75 A document is valid at all times; witnesses (may give valid evidence) as long as they live; possession acquires legal validity through the lapse of a certain period. This is a legal maxim.\n\np. 60\n\n76. 76 Of the three modes of proof here enumerated in order, each previous one is superior to the one named after it; but possession is the most decisive of all.\n\n* 77. 77 Though a document be in existence and witnesses living, that is no (true) property of which possession is not actually held. This is specially true as regards immovables.\n\n* 78. 78 If a man is foolish enough to allow his goods to be enjoyed by strangers in his own eyesight, they shall belong to the possessor, even in the presence and during the lifetime of the rightful owner.\n\n* 79. 79 Whatever the owner looking on quietly suffers to be enjoyed by strangers for ten years,\n\np. 61\n\nthough he is present, that cannot be recovered by him.\n\n80. 80 If he is neither an idiot nor a minor, and the enjoyment takes place before his eyes, his right to it is extinct by law, and the possessor is allowed to keep it.\n\n* 81. 81 A pledge; a boundary; the property of a child; an open deposit, an Upanidhi deposit; women; and what belongs to the king or to a learned Brahman, none (of these descriptions of property) is lost (to the owner) by adverse possession.\n\n82. 82 Pledges and the rest, excepting the property of a woman and of the king, are however lost to the owner if they have been enjoyed in his presence for twenty years.\n\np. 62\n\n* 83. The property of a woman and of a king is never lost (to the owner), should it even have been enjoyed for hundreds of years without a title (by strangers).\n\n84\\. Where there is enjoyment, but no title of any sort, there a title is\nrequired in order to produce proprietary right. Possession is not sufficient\nto create proprietary right in that case.\n\n* 85. A clear title having been produced, possession acquires validity. Possession without a clear title does not make evidence (of ownership).\n\n* 86. He who can only plead possession, without being able to adduce any title, has to be considered as a thief, in consequence of his pleading such illegitimate possession.\n\n* 87. He who enjoys without a title for ever so many hundred years, the ruler of the land should inflict on that sinful man the punishment ordained for a thief.\n\n* 88. 88 If a man holds the property of a stranger without a title, it is not legitimate enjoyment. However, after the death of the occupant, it may be enjoyed legitimately by his descendants.\n\n* 89. 89 In cases falling within the memory of man,\n\np. 63\n\npossession with a title creates ownership. In cases extending beyond the\nmemory of man, and on failure of documents, the hereditary succession of three\nancestors (has the same effect).\n\n* 90. 90 If the occupant is impeached (by the legitimate owner), he cannot escape defeat (without refuting the charge). That possession only can create proprietary right, which has been legitimately inherited from the father.\n\n* 91. 91 When possession has been successively held, even unlawfully, by the three ancestors of the father (of the present possessor), the property cannot be taken away from him, because it has gone through three lives in order.\n\n* 92. 92 What has been deposited with a third person to be delivered ultimately to the owner (Anvahita), stolen goods, ordinary deposits, what is held by force, loans for use, and what is being enjoyed during the absence of the owner, these are six (things possessed) without a title.\n\np. 64\n\n* 93. 93 If a litigant dies before a lawsuit (regarding property enjoyed by him) has been decided, the son is required to prove his title. The enjoyment is not legitimate (otherwise).\n\n* 94. 94 After the death of a creditor, witnesses, though available, cannot give valid evidence, except if a statement made by the creditor himself on his deathbed (has been preserved).\n\n95. 95 After the death of the defendant, the deposition of witnesses ceases to make evidence. An attested document retains its validity during his lifetime only.\n\n* 96. 96 Where a pious act is announced by a diseased\n\np. 65\n\nman, the testimony of the witnesses retains its validity even after his death.\nThe case is the same with the six (things possessed without a title), viz. an\nAnvahita deposit and the rest.\n\n97. 97 In all transactions relative to a debt or to any other (among the eighteen titles of law), the last act is the decisive one. In the case of a gift, a pledge, or a purchase, the prior act settles the matter.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[58:69](sbe3312.htm#fr_174) The term prama _n_ a, which has been translated\n'means of proof,' is both a philosophical and a law term. A. explains it\netymologically, as denoting anything which may be known or discerned\naccurately. Thus, what is counted or reckoned, may be known by figures. What\nis capable of measurement, may be known by its measure. Similarly, where a\nlawsuit is pending, the truth may be known by having recourse to one of the\nordinary modes of proof, viz. documents, witnesses, possession, and ordeals.\nTherefore, these means of proof should be duly applied by holy men, kings, and\nassessors of the court, and others endowed with legal authority, because that\nwhich is doubtful cannot be proved otherwise.\n\n[58:70](sbe3312.htm#fr_175) The term 'documents' in this section seems to\nrelate principally to the well-known land grants which have been found in many\np. 59 parts of India. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 22; Vish _n_ u VI, 23; Vasish\n_th_ a XVI, 10.\n\n[59:75](sbe3312.htm#fr_176) Witnesses can give evidence while they live only,\nwhereas a document which has been carefully preserved, remains evidence even\nafter the death of the creditor, debtor, and witnesses, and is capable of\nsubstantiating a claim raised by the son, grandson, great-grandson, or more\nremote descendant of the original owner. On the other hand, even after a lapse\nof time, i.e. when four or five generations have passed away, and an\nimmeasurable period has elapsed, a creditor may recover his loan by dint of\nuninterrupted possession. 'This is a legal maxim,' i.e. this is the relative\nvalue of the divers kinds of proof. A.\n\n[60:76](sbe3312.htm#fr_177) The apparent contradiction between the first and\nsecond parts of this paragraph is thus removed by A.: 'Possession of\nimmovables without a title does not create proprietary right, as stated in\npar. 84. Therefore, the possessor of landed property becomes its lawful owner,\nif his right or title is established by witnesses, but not otherwise. Thus far\npossession is more important than witnesses. In the same way documents with a\ntitle are superior to witnesses, and possession with a title is superior to\nwitnesses, documents, and ordeals.'\n\n[60:77](sbe3312.htm#fr_178) This paragraph is intended to show the weakness of\nproof by witnesses or documents, where it is not accompanied by possession.\nGenerally speaking, any of the three kinds of proof is invalid, where it is\nnot accompanied by one of the other kinds. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 2 7; Manu\nVIII, 200.\n\n[60:78](sbe3312.htm#fr_179) If a man suffers his movable or immovable property\nto be enjoyed by another, the latter will become its lawful owner after the\nlapse of a long period, no matter whether it has been bestowed on him through\naffection, or forcibly seized by him, or abandoned by its previous owner. A.\n\n[60:79](sbe3312.htm#fr_180) Where, however, the owner, though unable to\nrecover his property, owing to special reasons, proffers his claim to it every\nday, or every month, or every year, it is not lost to him, even after the\nlapse of a longer period than ten years. A. Identical with Manu VIII, 147.\n\n[61:80](sbe3312.htm#fr_181) 'If he is not an idiot,' nor afflicted by a\nchronic or agonising disease, nor dumb, blind, or deaf. A. Identical with Manu\nVIII, 148.\n\n[61:81](sbe3312.htm#fr_182) 'The property of children' is not lost, though it\nhas been enjoyed for a long time by their guardian. 'An Upanidhi deposit,'\ni.e. a valuable article which has been delivered under cover to another\nperson. 'A woman,' one who has been delivered to a stranger as a deposit, and\nenjoyed by him. 'The property of a king,' i.e. land. 'The property of a\nlearned Brahman,' i.e. cows. A. Kulluka, in commenting on the identical verse\nof Manu, refers the term 'woman' to 'female slaves,' &c. The rules laid down\nin pars. 79-81, which recur literally in the code of Manu, seem to belong to\nan older order of ideas than those contained in pars. 84 foll. It may be\npresumed that the harsh law under which adverse possession of ten years\xc2\x92\nstanding was constituted a source of proprietary right, was mitigated at a\nsubsequent period, and has been inserted here as a sort of historical\nreminiscence only. According to B _ri_ haspati, thirty years is the ordinary\nperiod of prescription. Identical with Manu VIII, 149; Vasish _th_ a XVI, 18.\n\n[61:82](sbe3312.htm#fr_183) In this paragraph, as in the preceding one, the\nterm 'a king\xc2\x92s property' is referred to landed property by A. The correctness\nof this interpretation seems questionable.\n\n[62:88](sbe3312.htm#fr_184) While the possessor is alive, the property which\nhe is enjoying without a title cannot become his. The owner may claim it at\nany time. When, however, the possessor dies, unmolested by the owner, the\nproperty continues to be enjoyed by his heirs. Therefore, the owner should not\nfail to assert his own right. A.\n\n[62:89](sbe3312.htm#fr_185) The Mitakshara explains the term 'what falls\nwithin the memory of man' as denoting a period of 100 years, in accordance\nwith a text from the Veda, 'The life of men extends over a hundred years.' If\nthis explanation be correct, the present rule agrees in substance with the\nrule laid down in 89 b and 91, a period of a hundred years being about equal\nin duration to three lives. It is p. 63 true that another legislator, Vyasa,\nmentions sixty years as the duration of continued possession extending over\nthree generations.\n\n[63:90](sbe3312.htm#fr_186) If the owner claims his own property from the\npossessor, the former has to make good his claim. That enjoyment, however,\nwhich has passed from the father to the sons by right of inheritance,\nconstitutes a legal title for them. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 28.\n\n[63:91](sbe3312.htm#fr_187) If the great-great-grandfather has held\npossession, be it even without a title, of a certain thing, and if it has been\nenjoyed, after his death, by the great-grandfather and by the grandfather, it\ncannot be claimed from the father by any one. Vish _n_ u V, 187.\n\n[63:92](sbe3312.htm#fr_188) The term Anvahita is usually explained, like\nAnvadhi, as denoting what has been deposited with a third person to be\ndelivered ultimately to the owner. A., however, explains Anvahita as denoting\na valuable object received from another in exchange for a worthless article.\n\n[64:93](sbe3312.htm#fr_189) Supposing a man were to have obtained possession\nof the property of a stranger by one of the previously mentioned illegitimate\nmodes of acquisition, if the rightful owner were to impeach him for it, and if\nthe possessor were to die before the case has been decided, in that case the\nson would have to substantiate his claim, and would not be allowed to continue\nhis enjoyment of the property without doing so. A. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 29.\n\n[64:94](sbe3312.htm#fr_190) A man says after the death of his creditor, 'I\nhave restored this or that cow, female buffalo, bull, or field to my creditor;\ncertain honest men have witnessed the transaction.' Another man says, 'Your\nfather owes me one hundred drachmas; certain persons have witnessed the\ntransaction.' He dies, however, before his claim has been examined. In either\nof these two cases trustworthy witnesses even are of no avail. If, however,\nthe creditor has stated his claim before witnesses on his deathbed; or if a\nman has given evidence as witness on his deathbed regarding a certain loan,\nabout which the creditor has asked him; the testimony of the witnesses has to\nbe considered as valid even after his death. A.\n\n[64:95](sbe3312.htm#fr_191) 'The defendant,' i.e. the debtor. An attested\ndocument is valid while he lives Only. It loses its validity after his death.\nA.\n\n[64:96](sbe3312.htm#fr_192) When a diseased father has stated his intentions\nregarding a religious endowment or other matters of this kind during the\nabsence of his sons, but in the presence of witnesses, the deposition of the\nlatter will be valid even after his death. Similarly, when a man p. 65 during\nan attack of illness, repents of his former act, and declares before witnesses\nthat he has deposited with a friend a worthless object in exchange for a\nvaluable one, and wishes to restore the former; or that he has stolen\nsomething and wishes to restore it to the owner; or that he wishes to restore\na deposit, which had been delivered to him by the owner; or that he intends to\nmake restoration of what he had obtained by forcible means; or of a loan for\nuse; or of what he had been enjoying in secret: in any one out of these six\ncases the deposition of the witnesses is valid even after his death. A. See\npar. 92 and note.\n\n[65:97](sbe3312.htm#fr_193) In all the eighteen titles of law, beginning with\nthe law of debt, the latest act is considered decisive. The law is different\nin cases of acceptance, where e.g. a village belongs to him who has been the\nfirst to receive it; in the case of a pledge or mortgage, and in the case of a\npurchase, where the pledge or mortgage, and the article sold belong likewise\nto the first taker. A. Nearly identical with Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 23.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 6. Lending Money at Interest](sbe3313.htm)\n\n"
