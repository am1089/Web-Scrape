Hari _h_ , Om. There is this city of Brahman (the body), and in it the\npalace, the small lotus (of\n\np. 126\n\nthe heart), and in it that small ether. Now what exists within that small\nether, that is to be sought for, that is to be understood.\n\n2\\. And if they should say to him: 'Now with regard to that city of Brahman,\nand the palace in it, i. e. the small lotus of the heart, and the small ether\nwithin the heart, what is there within it that deserves to be sought for, or\nthat is to be understood?'\n\n3\\. Then he should say: 'As large as this ether (all space) is, so large is\nthat ether within the heart. Both heaven and earth are contained within it,\nboth fire and air, both sun and moon, both lightning and stars; and whatever\nthere is of him (the Self) here in the world, and whatever is not (i. e.\nwhatever has been or will be), all that is contained within it 1.'\n\n4\\. And if they should say to him: 'If everything that exists is contained in\nthat city of Brahman, all beings and all desires (whatever can be imagined or\ndesired), then what is left of it, when old age reaches it and scatters it, or\nwhen it falls to pieces?'\n\n5\\. Then he should say: 'By the old age of the body, that (the ether, or\nBrahman within it) does not age; by the death of the body, that (the ether, or\nBrahman within it) is not killed. That (the Brahman)\n\np. 127\n\nis the true Brahma-city (not the body 1). In it all desires are contained. It\nis the Self, free from sin, free from old age, from death and grief, from\nhunger and thirst, which desires nothing but what it ought to desire, and\nimagines nothing but what it ought to imagine. Now as here on earth people\nfollow as they are commanded, and depend on the object which they are attached\nto, be it a country or a piece of land,\n\n6\\. 'And as here on earth, whatever has been acquired by exertion, perishes,\nso perishes whatever is acquired for the next world by sacrifices and other\ngood actions performed on earth. Those who depart from hence without having\ndiscovered the Self and those true desires, for them there is no freedom in\nall the worlds. But those who depart from hence, after having discovered the\nSelf and those true desires 2, for them there is freedom in all the worlds.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[125:2](sbe01161.htm#fr_327) The eighth Prapathaka seems to form a kind of\nappendix to the Upanishad. The highest point that can be reached by\nspeculation had been reached in the seventh Prapathaka, the identity of our\nself and of everything else with the Highest Self. This speculative effort,\nhowever, is too much for ordinary people. They cannot conceive the Sat or\nBrahman as out of space and time, as free from all qualities, and in order to\nhelp them, they are taught to adore the Brahman, as it appears in space and\ntime, an object endowed with certain qualities, living in nature and in the\nhuman heart. The Highest Brahman, besides which there is nothing, and which\ncan neither be reached as an object, nor be considered as p. 126 an effect,\nseems to ordinary minds like a thing which is not. Therefore while the true\nphilosopher, after acquiring the knowledge of the Highest Sat, becomes\nidentified with it suddenly, like lightning, the ordinary mortal must reach it\nby slow degrees, and as a preparation for that higher knowledge which is to\nfollow, the eighth Prapathaka, particularly the first portion of it, has been\nadded to the teaching contained in the earlier books.\n\n[126:1](sbe01161.htm#fr_328) The ether in the heart is really a name of\nBrahman. He is there, and therefore all that comes of him when he assumes\nbodily shapes, both what is and what is not, i.e. what is no longer or not\nyet; for the absolute nothing is not intended here.\n\n[127:1](sbe01161.htm#fr_329) I translate this somewhat differently from the\ncommentator, though the argument remains the same.\n\n[127:2](sbe01161.htm#fr_330) True desires are those which we ought to desire,\nand the fulfilment of which depends on ourselves, supposing that we have\nacquired the knowledge which enables us to fulfil them.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VIII, 2](sbe01162.htm)\n\n"
