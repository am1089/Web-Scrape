He hated flattery, but he liked, when flattered, to be flattered\nin his own person; a feature in their royal patron\'s character which the Nine\nGems of Science had turned to their own account.\n\nNow the young prince Raja Ram (continued the tale teller) had an old father,\nconcerning whom I may say that he was exceedingly unlike your Rajaship, both\nas a man and as a parent. He was fond of hunting, dicing, sleeping by day,\ndrinking at night, and eating perpetual tonics, while he delighted in the\nidleness of watching nautch girls, and the vanity of falling in love. But he\nwas adored by his children because he took the trouble to win their hearts. He\ndid not lay it down as a law of heaven that his offspring would assuredly go\nto Patala if they neglected the duty of bestowing upon him without cause all\ntheir affections, as your moral, virtuous, and highly respectable fathers are\nonly too apt----. Aie! Aie!\n\nThese sounds issued from the Vampire\'s lips as the warrior king, speechless\nwith wrath, passed his hand behind his back, and viciously twisted up a piece\nof the speaker\'s skin. This caused the Vampire to cry aloud, more however, it\nwould appear, in derision than in real suffering, for he presently proceeded\nwith the same subject.\n\nFathers, great king, may be divided into three kinds; and be it said aside,\nthat mothers are the same. Firstly, we have the parent of many ideas, amusing,\npleasant, of course poor, and the idol of his children. Secondly, there is the\nparent with one idea and a half. This sort of man would, in your place, say to\nhimself, "That demon fellow speaks a manner of truth. I am not above learning\nfrom him, despite his position in life. I will carry out his theory, just to\nsee how far it goes"; and so saying, he wends his way home, and treats his\nyoung ones with prodigious kindness for a time, but it is not lasting.\nThirdly, there is the real one-idea\'d type of parent-yourself, O warrior king\nVikram, an admirable example. You learn in youth what you are taught: for\ninstance, the blessed precept that the green stick is of the trees of\nParadise; and in age you practice what you have learned. You cannot teach\nyourselves anything before your beards sprout, and when they grow stiff you\ncannot be taught by others. If any one attempt to change your opinions you\ncry,\n\nWhat is new is not true, What is true is not new.\n\nand you rudely pull his hand from the subject. Yet have you your uses like\nother things of earth. In life you are good working camels for the mill-track,\nand when you die your ashes are not worse compost than those of the wise.\n\nYour Rajaship will observe (continued the Vampire, as Vikram began to show\nsymptoms of ungovernable anger) that I have been concise in treating this\ndigression. Had I not been so, it would have led me far indeed from my tale.\nNow to return.\n\nWhen the old king became air mixed with air, the young king, though he found\nhardly ten pieces of silver in the paternal treasury and legacies for\nthousands of golden ounces, yet mourned his loss with the deepest grief. He\neasily explained to himself the reckless emptiness of the royal coffers as a\nproof of his dear kind parent\'s goodness, because he loved him.\n\nBut the old man had left behind him, as he could not carry it off with him, a\ntreasure more valuable than gold and silver: one Churaman, a parrot, who knew\nthe world, and who besides discoursed in the most correct Sanscrit. By sage\ncounsel and wise guidance this admirable bird soon repaired his young master\'s\nshattered fortunes.\n\nOne day the prince said, "Parrot, thou knowest everything: tell me where there\nis a mate fit for me. The shastras inform us, respecting the choice of a wife,\n\'She who is not descended from his paternal or maternal ancestors within the\nsixth degree is eligible by a high caste man for nuptials. In taking a wife\nlet him studiously avoid the following families, be they ever so great, or\never so rich in kine, goats, sheep, gold, or grain: the family which has\nomitted prescribed acts of devotion; that which has produced no male children;\nthat in which the Veda (scripture) has not been read; that which has thick\nhair on the body; and that in which members have been subject to hereditary\ndisease. Let a person choose for his wife a girl whose person has no defect;\nwho has an agreeable name; who walks gracefully, like a young elephant; whose\nhair and teeth are moderate in quantity and in size; and whose body is of\nexquisite softness.\'"\n\n"Great king," responded the parrot Churaman, "there is in the country of\nMagadh a Raja, Magadheshwar by name, and he has a daughter called Chandravati.\nYou will marry her; she is very learned, and, what is better far, very fait.\nShe is of yellow colour, with a nose like the flower of the sesamum; her legs\nare taper, like the plantain-tree; her eyes are large, like the principal leaf\nof the lotus; her eye-brows stretch towards her ears; her lips are red, like\nthe young leaves of the mango-tree; her face is like the full moon; her voice\nis like the sound of the cuckoo; her arms reach to her knees; her throat is\nlike the pigeon\'s; her flanks are thin, like those of the lion; her hair hangs\nin curls only down to her waist; her teeth are like the seeds of the\npomegranate; and her gait is that of the drunken elephant or the goose."\n\nOn hearing the parrot\'s speech, the king sent for an astrologer, and asked\nhim, "Whom shall I marry?" The wise man, having consulted his art, replied,\n"Chandravati is the name of the maiden, and your marriage with her will\ncertainly take place." Thereupon the young Raja, though he had never seen his\nfuture queen, became incontinently enamoured of her. He summoned a Brahman,\nand sent him to King Magadheshwar, saying, "If you arrange satisfactorily this\naffair of our marriage we will reward you amply"-a promise which lent wings to\nthe priest.\n\nNow it so happened that this talented and beautiful princess had a jay,[74]\nwhose name was Madan-manjari or Love-garland. She also possessed encyclopaedic\nknowledge after her degree, and, like the parrot, she spoke excellent\nSanscrit.\n\nBe it briefly said, O warrior king-for you think that I am talking fables--\nthat in the days of old, men had the art of making birds discourse in human\nlanguage. The invention is attributed to a great philosopher, who split their\ntongues, and after many generations produced a selected race born with those\nmembers split. He altered the shapes of their skulls by fixing ligatures\nbehind the occiput, which caused the sinciput to protrude, their eyes to\nbecome prominent, and their brains to master the art of expressing thoughts in\nwords.\n\nBut this wonderful discovery, like those of great philosophers generally, had\nin it a terrible practical flaw The birds beginning to speak, spoke wisely and\nso well, they told the truth so persistently, they rebuked their brethren of\nthe featherless skins so openly, they flattered them so little and they\ncounselled them so much, that mankind presently grew tired of hearing them\ndiscourse. Thus the art gradually fell into desuetude, and now it is numbered\nwith the things that were.\n\nOne day the charming Princess Chandravati was sitting in confidential\nconversation with her jay. The dialogue was not remarkable, for maidens in all\nages seldom consult their confidantes or speculate upon the secrets of\nfuturity, or ask to have dreams interpreted, except upon one subject. At last\nthe princess said, for perhaps the hundredth time that month, "Where, O jay,\nis there a husband worthy of me?"\n\n"Princess," replied Madan-manjari, "I am happy at length to be able as willing\nto satisfy your just curiosity. For just it is, though the delicacy of our\nsex--"\n\n"Now, no preaching!" said the maiden; "or thou shalt have salt instead of\nsugar for supper."\n\nJays, your Rajaship, are fond of sugar. So the confidante retained a quantity\nof good advice which she was about to produce, and replied,\n\n"I now see clearly the ways of Fortune. Raja Ram, king of Bhogavati, is to be\nthy husband. He shall be happy in thee and thou in him, for he is young and\nhandsome, rich and generous, good-tempered, not too clever, and without a\nchance of being an invalid."\n\nThereupon the princess, although she had never seen her future husband, at\nonce began to love him. In fact, though neither had set eyes upon the other,\nboth were mutually in love.\n\n"How can that be, sire?" asked the young Dharma Dhwaj of his father. " I\nalways thought that--"\n\nThe great Vikram interrupted his son, and bade him not to ask silly questions.\nThus he expected to neutralize the evil effects of the Baital\'s doctrine\ntouching the amiability of parents unlike himself.\n\nNow, as both these young people (resumed the Baital) were of princely family\nand well to do in the world, the course of their love was unusually smooth.\nWhen the Brahman sent by Raja Ram had reached Magadh, and had delivered his\nKing\'s homage to the Raja Magadheshwar, the latter received him with\ndistinction, and agreed to his proposal. The beautiful princess\'s father sent\nfor a Brahman of his own, and charging him with nuptial gifts and the\ncustomary presents, sent him back to Bhogavati in company with the other\nenvoy, and gave him this order, "Greet Raja Ram, on my behalf, and after\nplacing the tilak or mark upon his forehead, return here with all speed. When\nyou come back I will get all things ready for the marriage."\n\nRaja Ram, on receiving the deputation, was greatly pleased, and after\ngenerously rewarding the Brahmans and making all the necessary preparations,\nhe set out in state for the land of Magadha, to claim his betrothed.\n\nIn due season the ceremony took place with feasting and bands of music,\nfireworks and illuminations, rehearsals of scripture, songs, entertainments,\nprocessions, and abundant noise. And hardly had the turmeric disappeared from\nthe beautiful hands and feet of the bride, when the bridegroom took an\naffectionate leave of his new parents--he had not lived long in the house--and\nreceiving the dowry and the bridal gifts, set out for his own country.\n\nChandravati was dejected by leaving her mother, and therefore she was allowed\nto carry with her the jay, Madanmanian. She soon told her husband the\nwonderful way in which she had first heard his name, and he related to her the\nadvantage which he had derived from confabulation with Churaman, his parrot.\n\n"Then why do we not put these precious creatures into one cage, after marrying\nthem according to the rites of the angelic marriage (Gandharva-lagana)?" said\nthe charming queen. Like most brides, she was highly pleased to find an\nopportunity of making a match.\n\n"Ay! why not, love ? Surely they cannot live happy in what the world calls\nsingle blessedness," replied the young king. As bridegrooms sometimes are for\na short time, he was very warm upon the subject of matrimony.\n\nThereupon, without consulting the parties chiefly concerned in their scheme,\nthe master and mistress, after being comfortably settled at the end of their\njourney, caused a large cage to be brought, and put into it both their\nfavourites.\n\nUpon which Churaman the parrot leaned his head on one side and directed a\npeculiar look at the jay. But Madan- manjari raised her beak high in the air,\npuffed through it once or twice, and turned away her face in extreme disdain.\n\n"Perhaps," quoth the parrot, at length breaking silence, "you will tell me\nthat you have no desire to be married?"\n\n"Probably," replied the jay.\n\n"And why?" asked the male bird.\n\n"Because I don\'t choose," replied the female.\n\n"Truly a feminine form of resolution this," ejaculated the parrot. "I will\nborrow my master\'s words and call it a woman\'s reason, that is to say, no\nreason at all. Have you any objection to be more explicit?"\n\n"None whatever," retorted the jay, provoked by the rude innuendo into telling\nmore plainly than politely exactly what she thought; "none whatever, sir\nparrot. You he-things are all of you sinful, treacherous, deceitful, selfish,\ndevoid of conscience, and accustomed to sacrifice us, the weaker sex, to your\nsmallest desire or convenience."\n\n"Of a truth, fair lady," quoth the young Raja Ram to his bride, "this pet of\nthine is sufficiently impudent."\n\n"Let her words be as wind in thine ear, master," interrupted the parrot. "And\npray, Mistress Jay, what are you she-things but treacherous, false, ignorant,\nand avaricious beings, whose only wish in this world is to prevent life being\nas pleasant as it might be?"\n\n"Verily, my love," said the beautiful Chandravati to her bridegroom, "this thy\nbird has a habit of expressing his opinions in a very free and easy way."\n\n"I can prove what I assert," whispered the jay in the ear of the princess.\n\n"We can confound their feminine minds by an anecdote," whispered the parrot in\nthe ear of the prince.\n\nBriefly, King Vikram, it was settled between the twain that each should\nestablish the truth of what it had advanced by an illustration in the form of\na story.\n\nChandravati claimed, and soon obtained, precedence for the jay. Then the\nwonderful bird, Madan-manjari, began to speak as follows:-\n\nI have often told thee, O queen, that before coming to thy feet, my mistress\nwas Ratnawati, the daughter of a rich trader, the dearest, the sweetest,\nthe---\n\nHere the jay burst into tears, and the mistress was sympathetically affected.\nPresently the speaker resumed---\n\nHowever, I anticipate. In the city of Ilapur there was a wealthy merchant, who\nwas without offspring; on this account he was continually fasting and going on\npilgrimage, and when at home he was ever engaged in reading the Puranas and in\ngiving alms to the Brahmans. At length, by favour of the Deity, a son was born\nto this merchant, who celebrated his birth with great pomp and rejoicing, and\ngave large gifts to Brahmans and to bards, and distributed largely to the\nhungry, the thirsty, and the poor. When the boy was five years old he had him\ntaught to read, and when older he was sent to a guru, who had formerly himself\nbeen a student, and who was celebrated as teacher and lecturer.\n\nIn the course of time the merchant\'s son grew up. Praise be to Brahma! what a\nwonderful youth it was, with a face like a monkey\'s, legs like a stork\'s, and\na back like a camel\'s. You know the old proverb:--\n\nExpect thirty-two villanies from the limping, and eighty from the one-eyed\nman, But when the hunchback comes, say "Lord defend us!"\n\nInstead of going to study, he went to gamble with other ne\'er-do-weels, to\nwhom he talked loosely, and whom he taught to be bad-hearted as himself. He\nmade love to every woman, and despite his ugliness, he was not unsuccessful.\nFor they are equally fortunate who are very handsome or very ugly, in so far\nas they are both remarkable and remarked. But the latter bear away the palm.\nBeautiful men begin well with women, who do all they can to attract them, love\nthem as the apples of their eyes, discover them to be fools, hold them to be\ntheir equals, deceive them, and speedily despise them. It is otherwise with\nthe ugly man, who, in consequence of his homeliness, must work his wits and\ntake pains with himself, and become as pleasing as he is capable of being,\ntill women forget his ape\'s face, bird\'s legs, and bunchy back.\n\nThe hunchback, moreover, became a Tantri, so as to complete his villanies. He\nwas duly initiated by an apostate Brahman, made a declaration that he\nrenounced all the ceremonies of his old religion, and was delivered from their\nyoke, and proceeded to perform in token of joy an abominable rite. In company\nwith eight men and eight women-a Brahman female, a dancing girl, a weaver\'s\ndaughter, a woman of ill fame, a washerwoman, a barber\'s wife, a milkmaid, and\nthe daughter of a land-owner- choosing the darkest time of night and the most\nsecret part of the house, he drank with them, was sprinkled and anointed, and\nwent through many ignoble ceremonies, such as sitting nude upon a dead body.\nThe teacher informed him that he was not to indulge shame, or aversion to\nanything, nor to prefer one thing to another, nor to regard caste, ceremonial\ncleanness or uncleanness, but freely to enjoy all the pleasures of sense-that\nis, of course, wine and us, since we are the representatives of the wife of\nCupid, and wine prevents the senses from going astray. And whereas holy men,\nholding that the subjugation or annihilation of the passions is essential to\nfinal beatitude, accomplish this object by bodily austerities, and by avoiding\ntemptation, he proceeded to blunt the edge of the passions with excessive\nindulgence. And he jeered at the pious, reminding them that their ascetics are\nsafe only in forests, and while keeping a perpetual fast; but that he could\nsubdue his passions in the very presence of what they most desired.\n\nPresently this excellent youth\'s father died, leaving him immense wealth. He\nblunted his passions so piously and so vigorously, that in very few years his\nfortune was dissipated. Then he turned towards his neighbour\'s goods and\nprospered for a time, till being discovered robbing, he narrowly escaped the\nstake. At length he exclaimed, "Let the gods perish! the rascals send me\nnothing but ill luck!" and so saying he arose and fled from his own country.\n\nChance led that villain hunchback to the city of Chandrapur, where, hearing\nthe name of my master Hemgupt, he recollected that one of his father\'s\nwealthiest correspondents was so called. Thereupon, with his usual audacity,\nhe presented himself at the house, walked in, and although he was clothed in\ntatters, introduced himself, told his father\'s name and circumstances, and\nwept bitterly.\n\nThe good man was much astonished, and not less grieved, to see the son of his\nold friend in such woful plight. He rose up, however, embraced the youth, and\nasked the reason of his coming.\n\n"I freighted a vessel," said the false hunchback, "for the purpose of trading\nto a certain land. Having gone there, I disposed of my merchandise, and,\ntaking another cargo, I was on my voyage home. Suddenly a great storm arose,\nand the vessel was wrecked, and I escaped on a plank, and after a time arrived\nhere. But I am ashamed, since I have lost all my wealth, and I cannot show my\nface in this plight in my own city. My excellent father would have consoled me\nwith his pity. But now that I have carried him and my mother to Ganges,[75]\nevery one will turn against me; they will rejoice in my misfortunes, they will\naccuse me of folly and recklessness--alas! alas! I am truly miserable."\n\nMy dear master was deceived by the cunning of the wretch. He offered him\nhospitality, which was readily enough accepted, and he entertained him for\nsome time as a guest. Then, having reason to be satisfied with his conduct,\nHemgupt admitted him to his secrets, and finally made him a partner in his\nbusiness. Briefly, the villain played his cards so well, that at last the\nmerchant said to himself:\n\n"I have had for years an anxiety and a calamity in my house. My neighbours\nwhisper things to my disadvantage, and those who are bolder speak out with\nastonishment amongst themselves, saying, \'At seven or eight, people marry\ntheir daughters, and this indeed is the appointment of the law: that period is\nlong since gone; she is now thirteen or fourteen years old, and she is very\ntall and lusty, resembling a married woman of thirty. How can her father eat\nhis rice with comfort and sleep with satisfaction, whilst such a disreputable\nthing exists in his house? At present he is exposed to shame, and his deceased\nfriends are suffering through his retaining a girl from marriage beyond the\nperiod which nature has prescribed.\' And now, while I am sitting quietly at\nhome, the Bhagwan (Deity) removes all my uneasiness: by his favour such an\nopportunity occurs. It is not right to delay. It is best that I shall give my\ndaughter in marriage to him. Whatever can be done to-day is best; who knows\nwhat may happen to-morrow?\n\n"Thus thinking, the old man went to his wife and said to her, "Birth,\nmarriage, and death are all under the direction of the gods; can anyone say\nwhen they will be ours? We want for our daughter a young man who is of good\nbirth, rich and handsome, clever and honourable. But we do not find him. If\nthe bridegroom be faulty, thou sayest, all will go wrong. I cannot put a\nstring round the neck of our daughter and throw her into the ditch. If,\nhowever, thou think well of the merchant\'s son, now my partner, we will\ncelebrate Ratnawati\'s marriage with him."\n\nThe wife, who had been won over by the hunchback\'s hypocrisy, was also\npleased, and replied, "My lord! when the Deity so plainly indicates his wish,\nwe should do it; since, though we have sat quietly at home, the desire of our\nhearts is accomplished. It is best that no delay be made: and, having quickly\nsummoned the family priest, and having fixed upon a propitious planetary\nconjunction, that the marriage be celebrated."\n\nThen they called their daughter--ah, me! what a beautiful being she was, and\nworthy the love of a Gandharva (demigod). Her long hair, purple with the light\nof youth, was glossy as the bramra\'s[76] wing; her brow was pure and clear as\nthe agate; the ocean-coral looked pale beside her lips, and her teeth were as\ntwo chaplets of pearls. Everything in her was formed to be loved. Who could\nlook into her eyes without wishing to do it again? Who could hear her voice\nwithout hoping that such music would sound once more? And she was good as she\nwas fair. Her father adored her; her mother, though a middle-aged woman, was\nnot envious or jealous of her; her relatives doted on her, and her friends\ncould find no fault with her. I should never end were I to tell her precious\nqualities. Alas, alas ! my poor Ratnawati!\n\nSo saying, the jay wept abundant tears; then she resumed:\n\nWhen her parents informed my mistress of their resolution, she replied,\n"Sadhu-it is well!" She was not like most young women, who hate nothing so\nmuch as a man whom their seniors order them to love. She bowed her head and\npromised obedience, although, as she afterwards told her mother, she could\nhardly look at her intended, on account of his prodigious ugliness. But\npresently the hunchback\'s wit surmounted her disgust. She was grateful to him\nfor his attention to her father and mother; she esteemed him for his moral and\nreligious conduct; she pitied him for his misfortunes, and she finished with\nforgetting his face, legs, and back in her admiration of what she supposed to\nbe his mind.\n\nShe had vowed before marriage faithfully to perform all the duties of a wife,\nhowever distasteful to her they might be; but after the nuptials, which were\nnot long deferred, she was not surprised to find that she loved her husband.\nNot only did she omit to think of his features and figure; I verily believe\nthat she loved him the more for his repulsiveness. Ugly, very ugly men prevail\nover women for two reasons. Firstly, we begin with repugnance, which in the\ncourse of nature turns to affection; and we all like the most that which, when\nunaccustomed to it, we most disliked. Hence the poet says, with as much truth\nas is in the male:\n\nNever despair, O man! when woman\'s spite Detests thy name and sickens at thy\nsight: Sometime her heart shall learn to love thee more For the wild hatred\nwhich it felt before, &c.\n\nSecondly, the very ugly man appears, deceitfully enough, to think little of\nhis appearance, and he will give himself the trouble to pursue a heart because\nhe knows that the heart will not follow after him. Moreover, we women (said\nthe jay) are by nature pitiful, and this our enemies term a "strange\nperversity." A widow is generally disconsolate if she loses a little, wizen-\nfaced, shrunken shanked, ugly, spiteful, distempered thing that scolded her\nand quarrelled with her, and beat her and made her hours bitter; whereas she\nwill follow her husband to Ganges with exemplary fortitude if he was brave,\nhandsome, generous---\n\n"Either hold your tongue or go on with your story," cried the warrior king, in\nwhose mind these remarks awakened disagreeable family reflections.\n\n"Hi! hi! hi!" laughed the demon; "I will obey your majesty, and make Madan-\nmanjari, the misanthropical jay, proceed."\n\nYes, she loved the hunchback; and how wonderful is our love! quoth the jay. A\nlight from heaven which rains happiness on this dull, dark earth! A spell\nfalling upon the spirit, which reminds us of a higher existence! A memory of\nbliss! A present delight! An earnest of future felicity! It makes hideousness\nbeautiful and stupidity clever, old age young and wickedness good, moroseness\namiable, and low-mindedness magnanimous, perversity pretty and vulgarity\npiquant. Truly it is sovereign alchemy and excellent flux for blending\ncontradictions is our love, exclaimed the jay.\n\nAnd so saying, she cast a triumphant look at the parrot, who only remarked\nthat he could have desired a little more originality in her remarks.\n\nFor some months (resumed Madan-manjari), the bride and the bridegroom lived\nhappily together in Hemgupt\'s house. But it is said:\n\nNever yet did the tiger become a lamb;\n\nand the hunchback felt that the edge of his passions again wanted blunting. He\nreflected, "Wisdom is exemption from attachment, and affection for children,\nwife, and home." Then he thus addressed my poor young mistress:\n\n"I have been now in thy country some years, and I have heard no tidings of my\nown family, hence my mind is sad, I have told thee everything about myself;\nthou must now ask thy mother leave for me to go to my own city, and, if thou\nwishest, thou mayest go with me."\n\nRatnawati lost no time in saying to her mother, "My husband wishes to visit\nhis own country; will you so arrange that he may not be pained about this\nmatter?"\n\nThe mother went to her husband, and said, "Your son-in-law desires leave to go\nto his own country."\n\nHemgupt replied, " Very well; we will grant him leave. One has no power over\nanother man\'s son. We will do what he wishes."\n\nThe parents then called their daughter, and asked her to tell them her real\ndesire-whether she would go to her father-in-law\'s house, or would remain in\nher mother\'s home. She was abashed at this question, and could not answer; but\nshe went back to her husband, and said, "As my father and mother have declared\nthat you should do as you like, do not leave me behind."\n\nPresently the merchant summoned his son-in-law, and having bestowed great\nwealth upon him, allowed him to depart. He also bade his daughter farewell,\nafter giving her a palanquin and a female slave. And the parents took leave of\nthem with wailing and bitter tears; their hearts were like to break. And so\nwas mine.\n\nFor some days the hunchback travelled quietly along with his wife, in deep\nthought. He could not take her to his city, where she would find out his evil\nlife, and the fraud which he had passed upon her father. Besides which,\nalthough he wanted her money, he by no means wanted her company for life.\nAfter turning on many projects in his evil-begotten mind, he hit upon the\nfollowing:\n\nHe dismissed the palanquin-bearers when halting at a little shed in the thick\njungle through which they were travelling, and said to his wife, "This is a\nplace of danger; give me thy jewels, and I will hide them in my waist-shawl.\nWhen thou reachest the city thou canst wear them again." She then gave up to\nhim all her ornaments, which were of great value. Thereupon he inveigled the\nslave girl into the depths of the forest, where he murdered her, and left her\nbody to be devoured by wild beasts. Lastly, returning to my poor mistress, he\ninduced her to leave the hut with him, and pushed her by force into a dry\nwell, after which exploit he set out alone with his ill-gotten wealth, walking\ntowards his own city.\n\nIn the meantime, a wayfaring man, who was passing through that jungle, hearing\nthe sound of weeping, stood still, and began to say to himself, "How came to\nmy ears the voice of a mortal\'s grief in this wild wood?" then followed the\ndirection of the noise, which led him a pit, and peeping over the side, he saw\na woman crying at the bottom. The traveller at once loosened his gird cloth,\nknotted it to his turband, and letting down the line pulled out the poor\nbride. He asked her who she was and how she came to fall into that well. She\nreplied, "I am the daughter of Hemgupt, the wealthiest merchant in the city of\nChandrapur; and I was journeying wit my husband to his own country, when\nrobbers set upon us and surrounded us. They slew my slave girl, the threw me\ninto a well, and having bound my husband they took him away, together with my\njewels. I have no tidings of him, nor he of me." And so saying, she burst into\ntears and lamentations.\n\nThe wayfaring man believed her tale, and conducted her to her home, where she\ngave the same account of the accident which had befallen her, ending with,\n"beyond this, I know not if they have killed my husband, or have let him go."\nThe father thus soothed her grief "Daughter! have no anxiety; thy husband is\nalive, and by the will of the Deity he will come to thee in a few days.\nThieves take men\'s money, not their lives." Then the parents presented her\nwith ornaments more precious than those which she had lost; and summoning\ntheir relations and friends, they comforted her to the best of their power.\n\nAnd so did I. The wicked hunchback had, meanwhile, returned to his own city,\nwhere he was excellently well received, because he brought much wealth with\nhim. His old associates flocked around him rejoicing; and he fell into the\nsame courses which had beggared him before. Gambling and debauchery soon\nblunted his passions, and emptied his purse. Again his boon companions,\nfinding him without a broken cowrie, drove him from their doors, he stole and\nwas flogged for theft; and lastly, half famished, he fled the city. Then he\nsaid to himself, "I must go to my father-in-law, and make the excuse that a\ngrandson has been born to him, and that I have come to offer him\ncongratulations on the event."\n\nImagine, however, his fears and astonishment, when, as he entered the house,\nhis wife stood before him. At first he thought it was a ghost, and turned to\nrun away, but she went out to him and said, "Husband, be not troubled ! I have\ntold my father that thieves came upon us, and killed the slave girl and robbed\nme and threw me into a well, and bound thee and carried thee off. Tell the\nsame story, and put away all anxious feelings. Come up and change thy tattered\ngarments-alas! some misfortune hath befallen thee. But console thyself; all is\nnow well, since thou art returned to me, and fear not, for the house is shine,\nand I am thy slave."\n\nThe wretch, with all his hardness of heart, could scarcely refrain from tears.\nHe followed his wife to her room, where she washed his feet, caused him to\nbathe, dressed him in new clothes, and placed food before him. When her\nparents returned, she presented him to their embrace, saying in a glad way,\n"Rejoice with me, O my father and mother! the robbers have at length allowed\nhim to come back to us." Of course the parents were deceived, they are mostly\na purblind race; and Hemgupt, showing great favour to his worthless son-in-\nlaw, exclaimed, "Remain with us, my son, and be happy!"\n\nFor two or three months the hunchback lived quietly with his wife, treating\nher kindly and even affectionately. But this did not last long. He made\nacquaintance with a band of thieves, and arranged his plans with them.\n\nAfter a time, his wife one night came to sleep by his side, having put on all\nher jewels. At midnight, when he saw that she was fast asleep, he struck her\nwith a knife so that she died. Then he admitted his accomplices, who savagely\nmurdered Hemgupt and his wife; and with their assistance he carried off any\nvaluable article upon which he could lay his hands. The ferocious wretch! As\nhe passed my cage he looked at it, and thought whether he had time to wring my\nneck. The barking of a dog saved my life; but my mistress, my poor Ratnawati-\nah, me! ah, me!--\n\n"Queen," said the jay, in deepest grief, "all this have I seen with mine own\neyes, and have heard with mine own ears. It affected me in early life, and\ngave me a dislike for the society of the other sex. With due respect to you, I\nhave resolved to remain an old maid. Let your majesty reflect, what crime had\nmy poor mistress committed? A male is of the same disposition as a highway\nrobber; and she who forms friendship with such an one, cradles upon her bosom\na black and venomous snake."\n\n"Sir Parrot," said the jay, turning to her wooer, "I have spoken. I have\nnothing more to say, but that you he-things are all a treacherous, selfish,\nwicked race, created for the express purpose of working our worldly woe,\nand--"\n\n"When a female, O my king, asserts that she has nothing more to say, but,"\nbroke in Churaman, the parrot with a loud dogmatical voice, "I know that what\nshe has said merely whets her tongue for what she is about to say. This person\nhas surely spoken long enough and drearily enough."\n\n"Tell me, then, O parrot," said the king, "what faults there may be in the\nother sex."\n\n"I will relate," quoth Churaman, "an occurrence which in my early youth\ndetermined me to live and to die an old bachelor."\n\nWhen quite a young bird, and before my schooling began, I was caught in the\nland of Malaya, and was sold to a very rich merchant called Sagardati, a\nwidower with one daughter, the lady Jayashri. As her father spent all his days\nand half his nights in his counting-house, conning his ledgers and scolding\nhis writers, that young woman had more liberty than is generally allowed to\nthose of her age, and a mighty bad use she made of it.\n\nO king! men commit two capital mistakes in rearing the "domestic calamity,"\nand these are over-vigilance and under-vigilance. Some parents never lose\nsight of their daughters, suspect them of all evil intentions, and are silly\nenough to show their suspicions, which is an incentive to evil-doing. For the\nweak-minded things do naturally say, "I will be wicked at once. What do I now\nbut suffer all the pains and penalties of badness, without enjoying its\npleasures?" And so they are guilty of many evil actions; for, however vigilant\nfathers and mothers may be, the daughter can always blind their eyes.\n\nOn the other hand, many parents take no trouble whatever with their charges:\nthey allow them to sit in idleness, the origin of badness; they permit them to\ncommunicate with the wicked, and they give them liberty which breeds\nopportunity. Thus they also, falling into the snares of the unrighteous, who\nare ever a more painstaking race than the righteous, are guilty of many evil\nactions.\n\nWhat, then, must wise parents do? The wise will study the characters of their\nchildren, and modify their treatment accordingly. If a daughter be naturally\ngood, she will be treated with a prudent confidence. If she be vicious, an\napparent trust will be reposed in her; but her father and mother will secretly\never be upon their guard. The one-idea\'d--\n\n"All this parrot-prate, I suppose, is only intended to vex me," cried the\nwarrior king, who always considered himself, and very naturally, a person of\nsuch consequence as ever to be uppermost in the thoughts and minds of others.\n"If thou must tell a tale, then tell one, Vampire! or else be silent, as I am\nsick to the death of thy psychics."\n\n"It is well, O warrior king," resumed the Baital.\n\nAfter that Churaman the parrot had given the young Raja Ram a golden mine full\nof good advice about the management of daughters, he proceeded to describe\nJayashri.\n\nShe was tall, stout, and well made, of lymphatic temperament, and yet strong\npassions. Her fine large eyes had heavy and rather full eyelids, which are to\nbe avoided. Her hands were symmetrical without being small, and the palms were\never warm and damp. Though her lips were good, her mouth was somewhat\nunderhung; and her voice was so deep, that at times it sounded like that of a\nman. Her hair was smooth as the kokila\'s plume, and her complexion was that of\nthe young jasmine; and these were the points at which most persons looked.\nAltogether, she was neither handsome nor ugly, which is an excellent thing in\nwoman. Sita the goddess[77] was lovely to excess; therefore she was carried\naway by a demon. Raja Bali was exceedingly generous, and he emptied his\ntreasury. In this way, exaggeration, even of good, is exceedingly bad.\n\nYet must I confess, continued the parrot, that, as a rule, the beautiful woman\nis more virtuous than the ugly. The former is often tempted, but her vanity\nand conceit enable her to resist, by the self-promise that she shall be\ntempted again and again. On the other hand, the ugly woman must tempt instead\nof being tempted, and she must yield, because her vanity and conceit are\ngratified by yielding, not by resisting.\n\n"Ho, there!" broke in the jay contemptuously. "What woman cannot win the\nhearts of the silly things called men? Is it not said that a pig-faced female\nwho dwells in Landanpur has a lover?"\n\nI was about to remark, my king! said the parrot, somewhat nettled, if the aged\nvirgin had not interrupted me, that as ugly women are more vicious than\nhandsome women, so they are most successful. "We love the pretty, we adore the\nplain," is a true saying amongst the worldly wise. And why do we adore the\nplain? Because they seem to think less of themselves than of us-a vital\ncondition of adoration.\n\nJayashri made some conquests by the portion of good looks which she possessed,\nmore by her impudence, and most by her father\'s reputation for riches. She was\ntruly shameless, and never allowed herself fewer than half a dozen admirers at\nthe time. Her chief amusement was to appoint interviews with them\nsuccessively, at intervals so short that she was obliged to hurry away one in\norder to make room for another. And when a lover happened to be jealous, or\nventured in any way to criticize her arrangements, she replied at once by\nshowing him the door. Answer unanswerable!\n\nWhen Jayashri had reached the ripe age of thirteen, the son of a merchant, who\nwas her father\'s gossip and neighbour, returned home after a long sojourn in\nfar lands, whither he had travelled in the search of wealth. The poor wretch,\nwhose name, by-the-bye, was Shridat (Gift of Fortune), had loved her in her\nchildhood; and he came back, as men are apt to do after absence from familiar\nscenes, painfully full of affection for house and home and all belonging to\nit. From his cross, stingy old uncle to the snarling superannuated beast of a\nwatchdog, he viewed all with eyes of love and melting heart. He could not see\nthat his idol was greatly changed, and nowise for the better; that her nose\nwas broader and more club-like, her eyelids fatter and thicker, her under lip\nmore prominent, her voice harsher, and her manner coarser. He did not notice\nthat she was an adept in judging of men\'s dress, and that she looked with\nadmiration upon all swordsmen, especially upon those who fought upon horses\nand elephants. The charm of memory, the curious faculty of making past time\npresent caused all he viewed to be enchanting to him.\n\nHaving obtained her father\'s permission, Shridat applied for betrothal to\nJayashri, who with peculiar boldness, had resolved that no suitor should come\nto her through her parent. And she, after leading him on by all the coquetries\nof which she was a mistress, refused to marry him, saying that she liked him\nas a friend, but would hate him as a husband.\n\nYou see, my king! there are three several states of feeling with which women\nregard their masters, and these are love, hate, and indifference. Of all, love\nis the weakest and the most transient, because the essentially unstable\ncreatures naturally fall out of it as readily as they fall into it. Hate being\na sister excitement will easily become, if a man has wit enough to effect the\nchange, love; and hate-love may perhaps last a little longer than love-love.\nAlso, man has the occupation, the excitement, and the pleasure of bringing\nabout the change. As regards the neutral state, that poet was not happy in his\nideas who sang--\n\nWhene\'er indifference appears, or scorn, Then, man, despair! then, hapless\nlover, mourn!\n\nFor a man versed in the Lila Shastra[78] can soon turn a woman\'s indifference\ninto hate, which I have shown is as easily permuted to love. In which\npredicament it is the old thing over again, and it ends in the pure Asat[79]\nor nonentity.\n\n"Which of these two birds, the jay or the parrot, had dipped deeper into human\nnature, mighty King Vikram?" asked the demon in a wheedling tone of voice.\n\nThe trap was this time set too openly, even for the royal personage, to fall\ninto it. He hurried on, calling to his son, and not answering a word. The\nVampire therefore resumed the thread of his story at the place where he had\nbroken it off.\n\nShridat was in despair when he heard the resolve of his idol. He thought of\ndrowning himself, of throwing himself down from the summit of Mount\nGirnar,[80] of becoming a religious beggar; in short, of a multitude of\nfollies. But he refrained from all such heroic remedies for despair, having\nrightly judged, when he became somewhat calmer, that they would not be likely\nto further his suit. He discovered that patience is a virtue, and he resolved\nimpatiently enough to practice it. And by perseverance he succeeded. The worse\nfor him! How vain are men to wish! How wise is the Deity, who is deaf to their\nwishes!\n\nJayashri, for potent reasons best known to herself, was married to Shridat six\nmonths after his return home. He was in raptures. He called himself the\nhappiest man in existence. He thanked and sacrificed to the Bhagwan for\nlistening to his prayers. He recalled to mind with thrilling heart the long\nyears which he had spent in hopeless exile from all that was dear to him, his\nsadness and anxiety, his hopes and joys, his toils and troubles his loyal love\nand his vows to Heaven for the happiness of his idol, and for the furtherance\nof his fondest desires.\n\nFor truly he loved her, continued the parrot, and there is something holy in\nsuch love. It becomes not only a faith, but the best of faiths-an abnegation\nof self which emancipates the spirit from its straightest and earthliest\nbondage, the "I"; the first step in the regions of heaven; a homage rendered\nthrough the creature to the Creator; a devotion solid, practical, ardent, not\nas worship mostly is, a cold and lifeless abstraction; a merging of human\nnature into one far nobler and higher the spiritual existence of the supernal\nworld. For perfect love is perfect happiness, and the only perfection of man;\nand what is a demon but a being without love? And what makes man\'s love truly\ndivine, is the fact that it is bestowed upon such a thing as woman.\n\n"And now, Raja Vikram," said the Vampire, speaking in his proper person, "I\nhave given you Madanmanjari the jay\'s and Churaman the parrot\'s definitions of\nthe tender passion, or rather their descriptions of its effects. Kindly\nobserve that I am far from accepting either one or the other. Love is,\naccording to me, somewhat akin to mania, a temporary condition of selfishness,\na transient confusion of identity. It enables man to predicate of others who\nare his other selves, that which he is ashamed to say about his real self. I\nwill suppose the beloved object to be ugly, stupid, vicious, perverse,\nselfish, low minded, or the reverse; man finds it charming by the same rule\nthat makes his faults and foibles dearer to him than all the virtues and good\nqualities of his neighbours. Ye call love a spell, an alchemy, a deity. Why?\nBecause it deifies self by gratifying all man\'s pride, man\'s vanity, and man\'s\nconceit, under the mask of complete unegotism. Who is not in heaven when he is\ntalking of himself? and, prithee, of what else consists all the talk of\nlovers?"\n\nIt is astonishing that the warrior king allowed this speech to last as long as\nit did. He hated nothing so fiercely, now that he was in middle-age, as any\nlong mention of the "handsome god.[81]" Having vainly endeavoured to stop by\nangry mutterings the course of the Baital\'s eloquence, he stepped out so\nvigorously and so rudely shook that inveterate talker, that the latter once or\ntwice nearly bit off the tip of his tongue. Then the Vampire became silent,\nand Vikram relapsed into a walk which allowed the tale to be resumed.\n\nJayashri immediately conceived a strong dislike for her husband, and\nsimultaneously a fierce affection for a reprobate who before had been\nindifferent to her. The more lovingly Shridat behaved to her, the more vexed\nend annoyed she was. When her friends talked to her, she turned up her nose,\nraising her eyebrows (in token of displeasure), and remained silent. When her\nhusband spoke words of affection to her, she found them disagreeable, and\nturning away her face, reclined on the bed. Then he brought dresses and\nornaments of various kinds and presented them to her, saying, "Wear these."\nWhereupon she would become more angry, knit her brows, turn her face away, and\nin an audible whisper call him "fool." All day she stayed out of the house,\nsaying to her companions, "Sisters, my youth is passing away, and I have not,\nup to the present time, tasted any of this world\'s pleasures." Then she would\nascend to the balcony, peep through the lattice, and seeing the reprobate\ngoing along, she would cry to her friend, "Bring that person to me." All night\nshe tossed and turned from side to side, reflecting in her heart, "I am\npuzzled in my mind what I shall say, and whither I shall go. I have forgotten\nsleep, hunger, and thirst; neither heat nor cold is refreshing to me."\n\nAt last, unable any longer to support the separation from her reprobate\nparamour, whom she adored, she resolved to fly with him. On one occasion, when\nshe thought that her husband was fast asleep, she rose up quietly, and leaving\nhim, made her way fearlessly in the dark night to her lover\'s abode. A\nfootpad, who saw her on the way, thought to himself, "Where can this woman,\nclothed in jewels, be going alone at midnight?" And thus he followed her\nunseen, and watched her.\n\nWhen Jayashri reached the intended place, she went into the house, and found\nher lover lying at the door. He was dead, having been stabbed by the footpad;\nbut she, thinking that he had, according to custom, drunk intoxicating hemp,\nsat upon the floor, and raising his head, placed it tenderly in her lap. Then,\nburning with the fire of separation from him, she began to kiss his cheeks,\nand to fondle and caress him with the utmost freedom and affection.\n\nBy chance a Pisach (evil spirit) was seated in a large fig-tree[82] opposite\nthe house, and it occurred to him, when beholding this scene, that he might\namuse himself in a characteristic way. He therefore hopped down from his\nbranch, vivified the body, and began to return the woman\'s caresses. But as\nJayashri bent down to kiss his lips, he caught the end of her nose in his\nteeth, and bit it clean off. He then issued from the corpse, and returned to\nthe branch where he had been sitting.\n\nJayashri was in despair. She did not, however, lose her presence of mind, but\nsat down and proceeded to take thought; and when she had matured her plan she\narose, dripping with blood, and walked straight home to her husband\'s house.\nOn entering his room she clapped her hand to her nose, and began to gnash her\nteeth, and to shriek so violently, that all the members of the family were\nalarmed. The neighbours also collected in numbers at the door, and, as it was\nbolted inside, they broke it open and rushed in, carrying lights. There they\nsaw the wife sitting upon the ground with her face mutilated, and the husband\nstanding over her, apparently trying to appease her.\n\n"O ignorant, criminal, shameless, pitiless wretch!" cried the people,\nespecially the women; "why hast thou cut off her nose, she not having offended\nin any way?"\n\nPoor Shridat, seeing at once the trick which had been played upon him, thought\nto himself: "One should put no confidence in a changeful mind, a black\nserpent, or an armed enemy, and one should dread a woman\'s doings. What cannot\na poet describe? What is there that a saint (jogi) does not know? What\nnonsense will not a drunken man talk? What limit is there to a woman\'s guile?\nTrue it is that the gods know nothing of the defects of a horse, of the\nthundering of clouds, of a woman\'s deeds, or of a man\'s future fortunes. How\nthen can we know?" He could do nothing but weep, and swear by the herb basil,\nby his cattle, by his grain, by a piece of gold, and by all that is holy, that\nhe had not committed the crime.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the old merchant, Jayashri\'s father, ran off, and laid a\ncomplaint before the kotwal, and the footmen of the police magistrate were\nimmediately sent to apprehend the husband, and to carry him bound before the\njudge. The latter, after due examination, laid the affair before the king. An\nexample happening to be necessary at the time, the king resolved to punish the\noffence with severity, and he summoned the husband and wife to the court.\n\nWhen the merchant\'s daughter was asked to give an account of what had\nhappened, she pointed out the state of her nose, and said, "Maharaj! why\ninquire of me concerning what is so manifest?" The king then turned to the\nhusband, and bade him state his defence. He said, "I know nothing of it," and\nin the face of the strongest evidence he persisted in denying his guilt.\n\nThereupon the king, who had vainly threatened to cut off Shridat\'s right hand,\ninfuriated by his refusing to confess and to beg for mercy, exclaimed, "How\nmust I punish such a wretch as thou art?" The unfortunate man answered,\n"Whatever your majesty may consider just, that be pleased to do." Thereupon\nthe king cried, "Away with him, and impale him"; and the people, hearing the\ncommand, prepared to obey it.\n\nBefore Shridat had left the court, the footpad, who had been looking on, and\nwho saw that an innocent man was about to be unjustly punished, raised a cry\nfor justice and, pushing through the crowd, resolved to make himself heard. He\nthus addressed the throne: "Great king, the cherishing of the good, and the\npunishment of the bad, is the invariable duty of kings." The ruler having\ncaused him to approach, asked him who he was, and he replied boldly, "\nMaharaj! I am a thief, and this man is innocent and his blood is about to be\nshed unjustly. Your majesty has not done what is right in this affair."\nThereupon the king charged him to tell the truth according to his religion;\nand the thief related explicitly the whole circumstances, omitting of course,\nthe murder.\n\n"Go ye," said the king to his messengers, "and look in the mouth of the\nwoman\'s lover who has fallen dead. If the nose be there found, then has this\nthief-witness told the truth, and the husband is a guiltless man."\n\nThe nose was presently produced in court, and Shridat escaped the stake. The\nking caused the wicked Jayashri\'s face to be smeared with oily soot, and her\nhead and eyebrows to be shaved; thus blackened and disfigured, she was mounted\nupon a little ragged-limbed ass and was led around the market and the streets,\nafter which she was banished for ever from the city. The husband and the thief\nwere then dismissed with betel and other gifts, together with much sage advice\nwhich neither of them wanted.\n\n"My king," resumed the misogyne parrot, "of such excellencies as these are\nwomen composed. It is said that \'wet cloth will extinguish fire and bad food\nwill destroy strength; a degenerate son ruins a family, and when a friend is\nin wrath he takes away life. But a woman is an inflicter of grief in love and\nin hate, whatever she does turns out to be for our ill. Truly the Deity has\ncreated woman a strange being in this world.\' And again, \'The beauty of the\nnightingale is its song, science is the beauty of an ugly man, forgiveness is\nthe beauty of a devotee, and the beauty of a woman is virtue-but where shall\nwe find it?\' And again, \'Among the sages, Narudu; among the beasts, the\njackal; among the birds, the crow; among men, the barber; and in this world\nwoman-is the most crafty.\'\n\n"What I have told thee, my king, I have seen with mine own eyes, and I have\nheard with mine own ears. At the time I was young, but the event so affected\nme that I have ever since held female kind to be a walking pest, a two-legged\nplague, whose mission on earth, like flies and other vermin, is only to\nprevent our being too happy. O, why do not children and young parrots sprout\nin crops from the ground-from budding trees or vinestocks?"\n\n"I was thinking, sire," said the young Dharma Dhwaj to the warrior king his\nfather, "what women would say of us if they could compose Sanskrit verses!"\n\n"Then keep your thoughts to yourself," replied the Raja, nettled at his son\ndaring to say a word in favour of the sex. "You always take the part of\nwickedness and depravity---"\n\n"Permit me, your majesty," interrupted the Baital, "to conclude my tale."\n\nWhen Madan-manjari, the jay, and Churaman, the parrot, had given these\nillustrations of their belief, they began to wrangle, and words ran high. The\nformer insisted that females are the salt of the earth, speaking, I presume,\nfiguratively. The latter went so far as to assert that the opposite sex have\nno souls, and that their brains are in a rudimental and inchoate state of\ndevelopment. Thereupon he was tartly taken to task by his master\'s bride, the\nbeautiful Chandravati, who told him that those only have a bad opinion of\nwomen who have associated with none but the vicious and the low, and that he\nshould be ashamed to abuse feminine parrots, because his mother had been one.\n\nThis was truly logical.\n\nOn the other hand, the jay was sternly reproved for her mutinous and\ntreasonable assertions by the husband of her mistress, Raja Ram, who, although\nstill a bridegroom, had not forgotten the gallant rule of his syntax--\n\nThe masculine is more worthy than the feminine;\n\ntill Madan-manjari burst into tears and declared that her life was not worth\nhaving. And Raja Ram looked at her as if he could have wrung her neck.\n\nIn short, Raja Vikram, all the four lost their tempers, and with them what\nlittle wits they had. Two of them were but birds, and the others seem not to\nhave been much better, being young, ignorant, inexperienced, and lately\nmarried. How then could they decide so difficult a question as that of the\nrelative wickedness and villany of men and women? Had your majesty been there,\nthe knot of uncertainty would soon have been undone by the trenchant edge of\nyour wit and wisdom, your knowledge and experience. You have, of course, long\nsince made up your mind upon the subject? Dharma Dhwaj would have prevented\nhis father\'s reply. But the youth had been twice reprehended in the course of\nthis tale, and he thought it wisest to let things take their own way.\n\n"Women," quoth the Raja, oracularly, "are worse than we are; a man, however\ndepraved he may be, ever retains some notion of right and wrong, but a woman\ndoes not. She has no such regard whatever."\n\n"The beautiful Bangalah Rani for instance?" said the Baital, with a demonaic\nsneer.\n\nAt the mention of a word, the uttering of which was punishable by extirpation\nof the tongue, Raja Vikram\'s brain whirled with rage. He staggered in the\nviolence of his passion, and putting forth both hands to break his fall, he\ndropped the bundle from his back. Then the Baital, disentangling himself and\nlaughing lustily, ran off towards the tree as fast as his thin brown legs\nwould carry him. But his activity availed him little.\n\nThe king, puffing with fury, followed him at the top of his speed, and caught\nhim by his tail before he reached the siras-tree, hurled him backwards with\nforce, put foot upon his chest, and after shaking out the cloth, rolled him up\nin it with extreme violence, bumped his back half a dozen times against the\nstony ground, and finally, with a jerk, threw him on his shoulder, as he had\ndone before.\n\nThe young prince, afraid to accompany his father whilst he was pursuing the\nfiend, followed slowly in the rear, and did not join him for some minutes.\n\nBut when matters were in their normal state, the Vampire, who had endured with\nexemplary patience the penalty of his impudence, began in honeyed accents,\n\n"Listen, O warrior king, whilst thy servant recounts unto thee another true\ntale."\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Vampire\'s Third Story.
