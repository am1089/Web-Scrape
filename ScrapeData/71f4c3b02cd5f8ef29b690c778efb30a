As the\ninfluence of his life and doctrines grew, a tendency arose to connect all the\npopular stories of India round the great teacher. This could be easily\neffected owing to the wide spread of the belief in metempsychosis. All that\nwas told of the sages of the past could be interpreted of the Buddha by\nrepresenting them as pre-incarnations of him. Even with Fables, or beast-\ntales, this could be done, for the Hindus were Darwinists long before Darwin,\nand regarded beasts as cousins of men and stages of development in the\nprogress of the soul through the ages. Thus, by identifying the Buddha with\nthe heroes of all folk-tales and the chief characters in the beast-drolls, the\nBuddhists were enabled to incorporate the whole of the story-store of\nHindustan in their sacred books, and enlist on their side the tale-telling\ninstincts of men.\n\nIn making Buddha the centre figure of the popular literature of India, his\nfollowers also invented the Frame as a method of literary art. The idea of\nconnecting a number of disconnected stories familiar to us from _The Arabian\nNights,_ Boccaccio\'s _Decamerone,_ Chaucer\'s _Canterbury Tales,_ or even\n_Pickwick,_ is directly traceable to the plan of making Buddha the central\nfigure of India folk-literature. Curiously enough, the earliest instance of\nthis in Buddhist literature was intended to be a Decameron, ten tales of\nBuddha\'s previous births, told of each of the ten Perfections. Asvagosha, the\nearly Boccaccio, died when he had completed thirty-four of the Birth-Tales.\nBut other collections were made, and at last a corpus of the ATAKAS, or Birth-\nTales of the Buddha, was carried over to Ceylon, possibly as early as the\nfirst introduction of Buddhism, 241 B.C. There they have remained till the\npresent day, and have at last been made accessible in a complete edition in\nthe original Pali by Prof. Fausboll.\n\nThese JATAKAS, as we now have them, are enshrined in a commentary on the\n_gathas,_ or moral verses, written in Ceylon by one of Buddhaghosa\'s school in\nthe fifth century A.D. They invariably begin with a " Story of the Present,"\nan incident in Buddha\'s life which calls up to him a "Story of the Past," a\nfolk-tale in which he had played a part during one of his former incarnations.\nThus the fable of the Lion and the Crane, which opens the present collection,\nis introduced by a "Story of the Present" in the following words:--"A service\nhave we done thee" [the opening words of the _gatha_ or moral verse]. "This\nthe Master told while living at Jetavana concerning Devadatta\'s treachery. Not\nonly now, O Bhickkus, but in a former existence was Devadatta ungrateful. And\nhaving said this he told a tale." Then follows the tale as given above (pp. 1,\n2), and the commentary concludes: "The Master having given the lesson, summed\nup the Jataka thus: \'At that time, the Lion was Devadatta, and the Crane was I\nmyself." Similarly, with each story of the past the Buddha identifies himself,\nor is mentioned as identical with, the virtuous hero of the folk-tale. These\nJatakas are 550 __ in number, and have been reckoned to include some 2000\ntales. Some of these had been translated by Mr. Rhys-Davids _(Buddhist Birth\nStories, I,_ Trubner\'s Oriental Library, 1880), Prof. Fausboll _(Five\nJatakas,_ Copenhagen), and Dr. R. Morris _(Folk-lore Journal,_ vols. ii.--v.)\nA few exist sculptured on the earliest Buddhist Stupas. Thus several of the\ncircular figure designs on the reliefs from Amaravati, now on the grand\nstaircase of the British Museum, represent Jatakas, or previous births of the\nBuddha.\n\nSome of the Jatakas bear a remarkable resemblance to some of the most familiar\nFABLES OF AESOP So close is the resemblance, indeed, that it is impossible not\nto surmise an historical relation between the two. What this relation is I\nhave discussed at considerable length in the "History of the Aesopic Fable,"\nwhich forms the introductory volume to my edition of Caxton\'s _Esope_ (London,\nD. Nut; "Bibliotheque de Carabas," 1889). In this place I can only roughly\nsummarise my results. I conjecture that a collection of fables existed in\nIndia before Buddha and independently of the Jatakas, and connected with the\nname of Kasyapa, who was afterwards made by the Buddhists into the latest of\nthe twenty-seven pre-incarnations of the Buddha. This collection of the Fables\nof Kasyapa was brought to Europe with a deputation from the Cingalese King\nChandra Muka Siwa (obiit 52 A.D.) to the Emperor Claudius about 50 A.D, and\nwas done into Greek as the \xce\x91\xe1\xbd\xb9\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xce\xb9 \xce\x91\xce\xbc\xce\xb2\xce\xb9\xce\xba\xce\xbf\xce\xb9 of "Kybises." These were utilised by\nBabrius (from whom the Greek AEsop is derived) and Avian, and so came into the\nEuropean Aesop. I have discussed all those that are to be found in the Jatakas\nin the" History " before mentioned, i pp. 54--73 (see Notes i. xv. xx.). In\nthese Notes henceforth I refer to the "History" as my _Aesop.\n\n_\n\nThere were probably other Buddhist collections of a similar nature to the\nJatakas with a framework. When the Hindu reaction against Buddhism came, the\nBrahmins adapted these, with the omission of Buddha as the central figure.\nThere is scarcely any doubt that the so-called FABLES OF BIDPAI were thus\nderived from Buddhistic sources. In its Indian form this is now extant as a\n_Panchatantra_ or Pentateuch, five books of tales connected by a Frame. This\ncollection is of special interest to us in the present connection, as it has\ncome to Europe in various forms and shapes. I have edited Sir Thomas North\'s\nEnglish version of an Italian adaptation of a Spanish translation of a Latin\nversion of a Hebrew translation of an Arabic adaptation of the Pehlevi version\nof the Indian original _(Fables of Bidpai,_ \'London, D. Nutt, "Bibliotheque de\nCarabas," 1888). In this I give a genealogical table of the various versions,\nfrom which I calculate that the tales have been translated into thirty-eight\nlanguages in 112 different versions, twenty different ones in English alone.\nTheir influence on European folk-tales has been very great: it is probable\nthat nearly one-tenth of these can be traced to the Biddai literature. (See\nNotes v. ix. x. xiii. xv.)\n\nOther collections of a similar character, arranged in a frame, and derived\nultimately from Buddhistic sources, also reached Europe and formed popular\nreading in the Middle Ages. Among these may be mentioned THE TALES OF\nSINDIBAD, known to Europe as _The Seven Sages of Rome:_ from this we get the\nGellert story _(cf. Celtic Fairy Tales),_ though it also occurs in the Bidpai.\nAnother popular collection was that associated with the life of St Buddha, who\nhas been canonised as St. Josaphat: BARLAAM AND JOSAPHAT tells of his\nconversion and much else besides, including the tale of The Three Caskets,\nused by Shakespeare in the _Merchant of Venice.\n\n_\n\nSome of the Indian tales reached Europe at the time of the Crusades, either\norally or in collections no longer extant. The earliest selection of these was\nthe _Disciplina Clericalis_ of Petrus Alphonsi, a Spanish Jew converted about\n1106; his tales were to be used as seasoning for sermons, and strong seasoning\nthey must have proved. Another Spanish collection of considerably later date\nwas entitled _El Conde Lucanor_ (Eng. trans. by W. York): this contains the\nfable of _The Man, his Son, and their Ass,_ which they ride or carry as the\npopular voice decides. But the most famous collection of this kind was that\nknown as GESTA ROMANORUM, much of which was certainly derived from Oriental\nand ultimately Indian sources, and so might more appropriately be termed\n_Gesta Indorum.\n\n_\n\nAll these collections, which reached Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth\ncenturies, became very popular, and were used by monks and friars to enliven\ntheir sermons as EXEMPLA. Prof. Crane has. given a full account of this very\ncurious phenomenon in his erudite edition of the _Exempla of Jacques de Vitry_\n(Folk Lore Society, 1890). The Indian stories were also used by the Italian\n_Novellieri;_ much of Boccaccio and his school being derived from this source.\nAs these again gave material for the Elizabethan Drama, chiefly in W.\nPainter\'s _Palace of Pleasure,_ a collection of translated _Novelle_ which I\nhave edited (Lond., 3 vols. 1890), it is not surprising that we can at times\ntrace portions of Shakespeare back to India. It should also be mentioned that\none-half of La Fontaine\'s Fables (Bks. vii.--xii.) are derived from Indian\nsources. _(See_ Note on No. v.)\n\nIn India itself the collection of stories in frames went on and still goes on.\nBesides those already mentioned there are the stories of _Vikram and the\nVampire_ (Vetala), translated among others by the late Sir Richard Burton, and\nthe seventy stories of a parrot _(Suka Saptati)._ The whole of this literature\nwas summed up by Somadeva, C. 1200 AD. in a huge compilation entitled _Katha\nSarit Sagara_ (" Ocean of the Stream of Stories "). Of this work, written in\nvery florid style, Mr. Tawney has produced a translation in two volumes, in\nthe _Bibliotheca Indica._ Unfortunately, there is a Divorce Court atmosphere\nabout the whole book, and my selections from it have been accordingly\nrestricted. (Notes, No. xi.)\n\nSo much for a short sketch of Indian folk-tales so far as they have been\nreduced to writing in the native literature. [An admirable and full account of\nthis literature was given by M. A. Barth in _M elusine, _t. iv. No. 12, and t.\nv. No. 1. See also Table i. of Prof. Rhys-Davids\' _Birth Stories._ ] The\nJatakas are probably the oldest collection of such tales in literature, and\nthe greater part of the rest are demonstrably more than a thousand years. old.\nIt is certain that much (perhaps one-fifth) of the popular literature of\nmodern Europe is derived from those portions of this large bulk which came\nWest with the Crusades through the medium of Arabs and Jews. In his elaborate\n_Einleitung_ to the _Pantschatantra,_ the Indian version of the Fables of\nBidpai, Prof. Benfey contended with enormous erudition that the majority of\nfolk-tale incidents were to be found in the Bidpai literature. His\nintroduction consisted of over 200 monographs on the spread of Indian tales to\nEurope. He wrote in 1859, before the great outburst of folk-tale collection in\nEurope, and he had not thus adequate materials to go about in determining the\nextent of Indian influence on the popular mind of Europe. But he made it clear\nthat for beast-tales and for drolls, the majority of those current in the\nmouths of occidental people were derived from Eastern and mainly Indian\nsources. He was not successful, in my opinion, in tracing the serious fairy\ntale to India. Few of the tales in the Indian literary collections could be\ndignified by the name of fairy tales, and it was clear that, if these were to\nbe traced to India, an examination of the contemporary folk-tales of the\npeninsula would have to be attempted.\n\nThe collection of current Indian folk-tales has been the work of the last\nquarter of a century, a work, even after what has been achieved, still in its\ninitial stages. The credit of having begun the process is due to Miss Frere,\nwho, while her father was Governor of the Bombay Presidency, took down from\nthe lips of her _ayah,_ Anna de Souza, one of a Lingaet family from Goa who\nhad been Christian for three generations, the tales she afterwards published\nwith Mr. Murray in 1868, under the title, _"Old Deccan Days, or, Indian Fairy\nLegends current in Southern India, collected from oral tradition by M. Frere,\nwith an introduction and notes by Sir Bartle Frere."_ Her example was followed\nby Miss Stokes in her _Indian Fairy Tales_ (London, Ellis & White, 1880), who\ntook down her tales from two _ayahs_ and a _Khitmatgar,_ all of them Bengalese\n--the _ayahs_ Hindus, and the man a Mohammedan. Mr. Ralston introduced the\nvolume with some remarks which dealt too much with sun-myths for present-day\ntaste. Another collection from Bengal was that of Lal Behari Day, a Hindu\ngentleman, in his _Folk-Tales of Bengal_ (London, Macmillan, 1883). The Panjab\nand the Kashmir then had their turn: Mrs. Steel collected, and Captain (now\nMajor) Temple edited and annotated, their _Wideawake Stories_ (London,\nTrubner, 1884), stories capitally told and admirably annotated. Captain Temple\nincreased the value of this collection by a remarkable analysis of all the\nincidents contained in the two hundred Indian folk-tales collected up to this\ndate. It is not too much to say that this analysis marks an onward step in the\nscientific study of the folk-tale: there is such a thing, derided as it may\nbe. I have throughout the Notes been able to draw attention to Indian\nparallels by a simple reference to Major Temple\'s Analysis.\n\nMajor Temple has not alone himself collected: he has been the cause that many\nothers have collected. In the pages of the _Indian Antiquary,_ edited by him,\nthere have appeared from time to time folk-tales collected from all parts of\nIndia Some of these have been issued separately. Sets of tales from Southern\nIndia, collected by the Pandit Natesa Sastri, have been issued under the title\n_Folk-Lore of Southern India,_ three fascicules of which have been recently\nre-issued by Mrs. Kingscote under the title, _Tales of the Sun_ (W. H. Allen,\n1891): it would have been well if the identity of the two works had been\nclearly explained. The largest,addition to our knowledge of the Indian folk-\ntale that has been made since _Wideawake Stories_ is that contained in Mr.\nKnowles\' _Folk-Tales_ _of Kashmir_ (Trubner\'s Oriental Library, 1887), sixty-\nthree stories, some of great length. These, with Mr. Campbell\'s _Santal Tales_\n(1892); Ramaswami Raju\'s _Indian Fables_ (London, Sonnenschein, n.d.); M.\nThornhill, _Indian Fairy Tales_ (London, 1889); and E. J _._ Robinson, _Tales\nof S. India_ (1885), together with those contained in books of travel like\nThornton\'s _Bannu_ or Smeaton\'s _Karens of Burmah,_ bring up the list of\nprinted Indian folk-tales to over 350--a respectable total indeed, but a mere\ndrop in the ocean of the stream of stories that must exist in such a huge\npopulation as that of India: the Central Provinces in particular are\npractically unexplored. There are doubtless many collections still\nunpublished. Col. Lewin has large numbers, besides the few published in his\n_Lushai Grammar;_ and Mr. M. L. Dames has a number of Baluchi tales which I\nhave been privileged to use. Altogether, India now ranks among the best\nrepresented countries for printed folk-tales, coming only after Russia (1500),\nGermany (1200), Italy and France (1000 each). [Finland boasts of 12,000, but\nmost of these lie unprinted among the archives of the Helsingfors Literary\nSociety.] Counting the ancient with the modern, India has probably some 600 to\n700 folk-tales printed and translated in accessible form. There should be\nenough material to determine the vexed question of the relations between the\nEuropean and the Indian collections.\n\nThis question has taken a new departure with the researches of M. Emanuel\nCosquin in his _Contes populaires de Lorraine_ (Paris, 1886, 2\xc2\xb0 tirage, 1890),\nundoubtedly the most important contribution to the scientific study of the\nfolk-tale since the Grimms. M. Cosquin gives in the annotations to the eighty-\ntour tales which he has collected in Lorraine a mass of information as to the\nvarious forms which the tales take in other countries of Europe and in the\nEast. In my opinion, the work he has done for the European folk-tale is even\nmore valuable than the conclusions he draws from it as to the relations with\nIndia. He has taken up the work which Wilhelm Grimm dropped in 1859, and shown\nfrom the huge accumulations of folk-tales that have appeared during the last\nthirty years that there is a common fund of folk-tales, which every country of\nEurope without exception possesses, though this does not, of course, preclude\nthem from possessing others that are not shared by the rest. M. Cosquin\nfurther contends that the whole of these have come from the East, ultimately\nfrom India, not by literary transmission, as Benfey contended, but by oral\ntransmission. He has certainly shown that very many of the most striking\nincidents common to European folk-tales are also to be found in Eastern _m\nahrchen. _What, however, he has failed to show is that some of these may not\nhave been carried out to the Eastern world by Europeans. Borrowing tales is a\nmutual process, and when Indian meets European, European meets Indian; which\nborrowed from which, is a question which we have very few criteria to decide.\nIt should be added that Mr. W. A. Clouston has in England collected with\nexemplary industry a large number of parallels between Indian and European\nfolk-tale incidents in his _Popular Tales and Fictions_ (Edinburgh, 2 vols.,\n1887) and _Book of Noodles_ (London, 1888). Mr. Clouston has not openly\nexpressed his conviction that all folk-tales are Indian in origin: he prefers\nto convince us _non vi sed saepe cadendo._ He has certainly made out a good\ncase for tracing all European drolls, or comic folk-tales, from the East.\n\nWith the fairy tale strictly so called-- _i.e_., the serious folk-tale of\nromantic adventure--I am more doubtful. It is mainly a modern product in India\nas in Europe, so far as literary evidence goes. The vast bulk of the Jatakas\ndoes not contain a single example worthy the name, nor does the Bidpai\nliterature. Some of Somadeva\'s tales, however, approach the nature of fairy\ntales, but there are several Celtic tales which can be traced to an earlier\ndate than his (1200 A.D.) and are equally near to fairy tales. Yet it is\ndangerous to trust to mere non-appearance in literature as proof of non-\nexistence among the folk. To take our own tales here in England, there is not\na single instance of a reference to _Jack and the Beanstalk_ for the last\nthree hundred years, yet it is undoubtedly a true folk-tale. And it is indeed\nremarkable how many of the _formulae_ of fairy tales have been found of recent\nyears in India. Thus, the _Magic Fiddle,_ found among the Santals by Mr..\nCampbell in two variants (see Notes on vi.), contains the germ idea of the\nwidespread story represented in Great Britain by the ballad of _Binnorie_ (see\n_English Fairy Tales,_ No. ix.). Similarly, Mr. Knowles\' collection has added\nconsiderably to the number of Indian variants of European "formulae" beyond\nthose noted by M. Cosquin.\n\nIt is still more striking as regards _incidents._ In a paper read before the\nFolk-Lore Congress of 1891, and reprinted in the _Transactions,_ pp. 76\n_seq.,_ I have drawn up a list of some 630 incidents found in common among\nEuropean folk-tales (including drolls). Of these, I reckon that about 250 have\nbeen already found among Indian folk-tales, and the number is increased by\neach new collection that is made or printed. The moral of this is, that India\nbelongs to a group of peoples who have a common store of stories; India\nbelongs to Europe for purposes of comparative folk-tales.\n\nCan we go further and say that India is the source of all the incidents that\nare held in common by European children? I think we may answer "Yes" as\nregards droll incidents, the travels of many of which we can trace, and we\nhave the curious result that European children owe their earliest laughter to\nHindu wags. As regards the serious incidents, further inquiry is needed. Thus,\nwe find the incident of an "external soul" (Life Index, Captain Temple very\nappropriately named it) in Asbjornsen\'s _Norse Tales_ and in Miss Frere\'s _Old\nDeccan Days_ (see Notes on _Punchkin)._ Yet the latter is a \'very suspicious\nsource, since Miss Frere derived her tales from a Christian _ayah_ whose\nfamily had been in Portuguese Goa for a hundred years. May they not have got\nthe story of the giant with his soul outside his body from some European\nsailor touching at Goa? This is to a certain extent negatived by the fact of\nthe frequent occurrence of the incident in Indian folk-tales (Captain Temple\ngave a large number of instances in _Wideawake Stories,_ pp. 404--5). On the\nother hand, Mr. Frazer in his _Golden Bough_ has shown the wide spread of the\nidea among all savage or semi-savage tribes. (See Note on No. iv.)\n\nIn this particular case we may be doubtful; but in others, again--as the\nincident of the rat\'s tail up nose (see Notes on _The Charmed Ring_ )--there\ncan be little doubt of the Indian origin. And generally, so far as the\nincidents are marvellous and of true fairy-tale character, the presumption is\nin favour of India, because of the vitality of animism or metempsychosis in\nIndia throughout all historic time. No Hindu would doubt the fact of animals\nspeaking or of men transformed into plants and animals. The European may once\nhave had these beliefs, and may still hold them implicitly as "survivals"; but\nin the "survival" stage they cannot afford material for artistic creation, and\nthe fact that the higher minds of Europe for the last thousand years have\ndiscountenanced these beliefs has not been entirely without influence. Of one\nthing there is practical certainty; the fairy tales that are common to the\nIndo-European world were invented once for all in a certain, locality, and\nthence spread to all the countries in culture contact with the original\nsource. The mere fact that contiguous countries have more similarities in\ntheir story store than distant ones is sufficient to prove this: indeed, the\nfact that any single country has spread throughout it a definite set of folk-\ntales as distinctive as its flora and fauna is sufficient to prove it. It is\nequally certain that not all folk-tales have come from one source, for each\ncountry has tales peculiar to itself. The question is as to the source of the\ntales that are common to all European children, and increasing evidence seems\nto show that this common nucleus is derived from India and India alone. The\nHindus have been more successful than others, because of two facts: they have\nhad the appropriate "atmosphere" of metempsychosis, and they have also had\nspread among the people sufficient literary training and mental grip to invent\nplots. The Hindu tales have ousted the native European, which undoubtedly\nexisted independently; indeed, many still survive, especially in Celtic lands.\nExactly in the same way, Perrault\'s tales have ousted the older English folk-\ntales, and it is with the utmost difficulty that one can get true English\nfairy tales because _Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Blue Beard, Puss in Boots_\nand the rest, have survived in the struggle for existence among English folk-\ntales. So far as Europe has a common store of fairy tales, it owes this to\nIndia.\n\nI do not wish to be misunderstood. I do not hold with Benfey that all European\nfolk-tales are derived from the Bidpai literature and similar literary\nproducts, nor with M. Cosquin that they are all derived from India. The latter\nscholar has proved that there is a nucleus of stories in every European land\nwhich is common to all. I calculate that this includes from 30 to 50 per cent.\nof the whole, and it is this common stock of Europe that I regard as coming\nfrom India mainly at the time of the Crusades, and chiefly by oral\ntransmission. It includes all the beast tales and most of the drolls, but\nevidence is still lacking about the more serious fairy tales, though it is\nincreasing with every fresh collection of folk-tales in India, the great\nimportance of which is obvious from the above considerations.\n\nIn the following Notes I give, as on the two previous occasions, the _source_\nwhence I derived the tale, then _parallels,_ and finally _remarks._ For Indian\n_parallels_ I have been able to refer to Major Temple\'s remarkable Analysis of\nIndian Folk-tale incidents at the end of _Wide-awake Stories_ (pp. 386--436),\nfor European ones to my alphabetical List of Incidents, with bibliographical\nreferences, in _Transactions of Folk-Lore Congress,_ 1892, pp. 87--98. My\n_remarks_ have been mainly devoted to tracing the relation between the Indian\nand the European tales, with the object of showing that the latter have been\nderived from the former. I have, however, to some extent handicapped myself,\nas I have avoided giving again the Indian versions of stories already given in\n_English Fairy Tales_ or _Celtic Fairy Tales.\n\n_\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Story Notes](ift32.htm)\n\n'
