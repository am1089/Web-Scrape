[1885], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\n3:8:4\n\n### FOURTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n3:8:4:11\\. Now there are three elevens at the animal offering,--eleven fore-\nofferings, eleven after-offerings, and eleven by-offerings: ten fingers, ten\ntoes, ten vital airs, and the out-breathing, in-breathing and through-\nbreathing--this much constitutes man, who is the highest of animals, after\nwhom 3 are all animals.\n\np. 211\n\n3:8:4:22\\. Now they say,' What, then, is done at the sacrifice whereby the\nvital air is kindly to all the limbs?'\n\n3:8:4:33\\. When he divides the hind-part into three portions,--the hind-part\nbeing (an opening of the) vital air, and that (animal) extending from thence\nforward, that vital air pervades it all through.\n\n3:8:4:44\\. And in that he cuts the hind-part into three portions,--one third\nfor the by-offerings, one third into the _g_ uhu, and one third into the upabh\n_ri_ t,--thereby the vital air is kindly to all the limbs.\n\n3:8:4:55\\. He alone, however, may slay an animal who can supply it with the\nsacrificial essence 1. And if it be lean, let him stuff into the hind-part\nwhatever may be left of the fat of the belly: the hind-part being (an opening\nof) the vital air, and that (animal) extending from thence forward, that vital\nair pervades it all through. The animal, forsooth, is breath; for only so long\n(does) the animal (live), as it breathes with the breath; but when the breath\ndeparts from it, it lies there useless, even (as) a block of wood.\n\n3:8:4:66\\. The hind-part is (part of) the animal, and fat means sacrificial\nessence 2: thus he supplies it with the sacrificial essence. But if it be\ntender (juicy), then it has itself obtained the sacrificial essence.\n\n3:8:4:77\\. Thereupon he takes clotted ghee; for twofold indeed is this\n(clotted ghee),--to wit, both ghee\n\np. 212\n\nand sour milk 1,--and a productive union means a couple: thus a productive\nunion is thereby effected.\n\n3:8:4:88\\. Therewith they perform at the after-offerings. The after-offerings\nmean cattle, and clotted ghee means milk: hence he thereby puts milk into the\ncattle, and thus milk is here contained (or beneficial, Nita) in the cattle;\nfor clotted ghee means breath, because clotted ghee is food, and breath is\nfood.\n\n3:8:4:99\\. Therewith he (the Adhvaryu) performs in front (on the \xc3\x82havaniya) at\nthe after-offerings,---whereby he puts into (the victim) that vital air which\nis here in front;--and therewith he (the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ) performs behind\n(the altar) at the by-offerings 2,--whereby he puts into it that vital air\nwhich is here behind: thus two vital airs are here contained (or beneficial)\non both sides, the one above and the one below.\n\n3:8:4:1010\\. Here now, one (Hot _ri_ ) pronounces the Vasha _t_ for two,--for\nthe Adhvaryu (who performs the after-offerings)\n\np. 213\n\nand for him (the Pratiprasthat _ri_ ) who performs the by-offerings. And\nbecause he offers them by (in addition to) the offering (Adhvaryu), therefore\nthey are called by-offerings. And in performing the by-offerings, he produces\n(offspring) 1, since he performs the by-offerings behind (the altar), and from\nbehind offspring is produced from woman.\n\n3:8:4:1111\\. He offers the by-offerings with (Va _g_. S. VI, 21), 'Go thou to\nthe sea, Hail!' The sea is water, and seed is water: he thereby casts seed.\n\n3:8:4:1212\\. 'Go thou to the air, Hail!' It is into (along) the air that\noffspring is born: into the air he produces (offspring).\n\n3:8:4:1313\\. 'Go thou to the divine Savit _ri_ , Hail!' Savit _ri_ is the\nimpeller of the gods: impelled by Savit _ri_ he thus produces creatures.\n\n3:8:4:1414\\. 'Go thou to Mitra and Varu _n_ a, Hail!' Mitra and Varu _n_ a are\nthe out-breathing and in-breathing: he thus bestows out-breathing and in-\nbreathing on the creatures.\n\n15\\. 'Go thou to the day and the night, Hail! It is through (along) day and\nnight that offspring is born: through day and night he causes creatures to be\nborn.\n\n3:8:4:1616\\. 'Go thou to the metres, Hail!' There are seven metres; and there\nare seven domestic and seven wild animals: both kinds he thus causes to be\nproduced.\n\n3:8:4:1717\\. 'Go thou to heaven and earth, Hail!' For, Pra _g_ apati, having\ncreated the living beings,\n\np. 214\n\nenclosed them between heaven and earth, and so these beings are enclosed\nbetween heaven and earth. And in like manner does this (offerer), having\ncreated living beings, enclose them between heaven and earth.\n\n3:8:4:1818\\. He then makes additional by-offerings (atiupaya _g_ ). Were he\nnot to make additional by-offerings, there would only be as many living beings\nas were created in the beginning; they would not be propagated; but by making\nadditional by-offerings he indeed propagates them; whence creatures are again\nborn here repeatedly 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[210:3](sbe2634.htm#fr_532) That is, inferior to whom, or, after the manner of\nwhom.\n\n[211:1](sbe2634.htm#fr_533) Saya _n_ a takes 'medham' as apposition to 'enam,'\nand explains it by 'medharha, prav _ri_ ddha,' and 'upanayet' by 'prapnuyat'\n(it is, doubtless, 'zufuhren'). The Ka _n_ va text, however, reads,--Tad ahu\n_h_ sa vai pa _s_ u _m_ labheteti ya ena _m_ medha upanayed iti.\n\n[211:2](sbe2634.htm#fr_534) Gudo vai pa _s_ u _h_ , medo vai medhas; this is\none of many exceptions to the rule laid down by Professor Delbruck regarding\nthe order of subject and predicate, Synt. Forsch., III, p. 26. Copulative\nsentences with a tertium comparationis likewise do not generally conform to\nthat rule.\n\n[212:1](sbe2634.htm#fr_535) See [p. 156](sbe2625.htm#page_156), note\n[3](sbe2625.htm#fn_414).\n\n[212:2](sbe2634.htm#fr_536) When the priests and sacrificer have eaten their\nportions of the I _d_ a, the Agnidh fetches hot coals from the _S_ amitra (or,\nat the animal offering connected with the Soma-sacrifice), optionally from the\n\xc3\x82gnidhra, and puts them on the Hot _ri_ 's hearth ([p.\n148](sbe2623.htm#page_148), note [4](sbe2624.htm#fn_392)),--or at the ordinary\nanimal offering (niru _dh_ a pa _s_ u), on the north hip (north-west corner)\nof the altar after removing the sacrificial grass. On these coals the\nPratiprasthat _ri_ performs the by-offerings (upaya _g_ ), while the Adhvaryu\nperforms the after-offerings (anuya _g_ a) on the \xc3\x82havaniya. For the by-\nofferings the Pratiprasthat _ri_ cuts the respective part and the hind-quarter\n([III, 8, 3, 18](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:18)) into eleven parts, and at each Vasha\n_t_ throws one piece thereof with his hand into the fire. The recipients of\nthe first eight and the last after-offerings, on the other hand, are the same\nas those of the nine after-offerings at the Seasonal sacrifices (part i, p.\n404). The Hot _ri_ 's formulas for the additional two offerings, inserted\nbefore the last, are: 9. The divine lord of the forest [10. The divine barhis\nof water-plants] may graciously accept (the offering) for abundant obtainment\nof abundant gift! Vausha _t_!' (cf. part i, p. 235; \xc3\x82 _s_ v. _S_ r. III, 6,\n13.)\n\n[213:1](sbe2634.htm#fr_537) Praivaina _m_ ta _g_ _g_ anayati, 'he causes it\n(the victim) to be born (again).' Ka _n_ va rec. The above passage has\napparently to be understood in a general sense, 'he causes birth to take place\namong living creatures.'\n\n[214:1](sbe2634.htm#fr_538) Or, 'by making additional by-offerings he\nreproduces them: whence creatures are born here returning again and again'\n(metempsychosis).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 8, 5.
