There not being (a cause), there results contradiction of the admitted\nprinciple; otherwise simultaneousness.\n\nIf it be said that the effect may originate even when a cause does not exist,\nthen--as we have pointed out before--anything might originate anywhere and at\nany time. And not only would the origination of the effect thus remain\nunexplained, but an admitted principle would also be contradicted. For you\nhold the principle that there are four causes bringing about the origination\nof a cognition, viz. the adhipati-cause, the sahakari-cause, the alambhana-\ncause, and the samanantara-cause. The term adhipati denotes the sense-organs.\n--And if, in order to avoid opposition to an acknowledged principle, it be\nassumed that the origination of a further momentary jar takes place at the\ntime when the previous momentary jar still exists, then it would follow that\nthe two momentary jars, the causal one and the effected one, would be\nperceived together; but as a matter of fact they are not so perceived. And,\nfurther, the doctrine of general momentariness would thus be given up. And\nshould it be said that(this is not so, but that) momentariness remains, it\nwould follow that the connexion of the sense-organ with the object and the\ncognition are simultaneous.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 21.
