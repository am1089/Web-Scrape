This can be considered a continuation of the [Terms of Service](tos.htm)\nfile.\n\n#### Using public domain files at this site\n\nMost of the files at this site are in the public domain _in the United\nStates_. This is because they were originally _printed in the US_ and:\n\n  * Their copyright has expired normally (they were published in or prior to 1922), or \n  * They were published between 1923 and 1964 (inclusive) and the copyright was not renewed, or \n  * They were published by the US Government. \n\nIn addition, books printed outside the US in or before 1922 are in the public\ndomain in the US.\n\nBooks and other content become public domain in different ways in different\ncountries. _So if you reside outside the US, you will have to use different\ncriteria to determine if a text is in the public domain._ In some countries,\nthis is determined by the date of death of the author. For instance, in the\nUnited Kindom or European Union books become public domain 70 years after the\ndeath of the author. This means that some books are in the public domain in\nthe US but not the UK. For instance, the book 'The Tarot Unveiled' was\npublished in 1910 in England. This means that it is in the public domain in\nthe US (it was published prior to 1922). However, the author, A.E. Waite, died\nin 1942. For this reason this book will not enter the public domain in the UK\nor the EU until 2012.\n\nPublic domain files from this site can be used for _any_ purposes. **You may**\n:\n\n  * Download, print and make copies of them for personal purposes \n  * Email them to a friend \n  * Use them for your class or study group \n  * Link your website to them \n  * Post copies of them on your website \n  * Embed the copy at sacred-texts in a frame at your website \n  * Use them in a paper for school \n  * Quote them in part or entirety in print: in a book, magazine, etc. \n  * Create derivative works: edited versions, anthologies, software products which use quotes from them, etc. \n  * Translate them into other languages \n  * etc. etc. etc. \n**without asking anyone (including sacred-texts) for permission**. In fact, we\nencourage these activities. It is considered good netiquette (but not\nabsolutely required) to identify sacred-texts as the source of the file.\nTherefore we request that leave any notices of attribution in the file intact,\nand add a link to sacred-texts if possible.\n\nThe public domain files at this site have been prepared for free distribution\nat great labor and expense. Public domain files prepared at sacred-texts _may_\nbe licensed for commercial use as a way of supporting the Internet Sacred Text\nArchive and the production of additional etexts. These files are listed in the\n[Bibliography](stbib.htm). Some other public domain files at this site may\nhave some trivial commercial-use restrictions, particularly files from Project\nGutenberg. Most other public domain files at this site can be used in\ncommercial projects without any payment. [Email us if you have any\nquestions](contact.htm).\n\nNote that this doesn't restrict you from using these books for commercial use\nif you are willing to make your own transcription of them. We have no\nobjection to this as we do not claim to own these works.\n\n* * *\n\n#### Copyrighted files at this site\n\nSome texts are copyrighted but released by their copyright holders for _non-\ncommercial_ use. Most of these files also have stipulations that the file must\nbe distributed in entirety and intact, including any copyright and usage\nmessages.\n\nIn other cases the file may be copyrighted and posted in error. If this is the\ncase, and you are the copyright holder, please contact us and we will promptly\nremove it.\n\nSome texts which are copyrighted or have unknown copyright status have the\nfollowing icon next to their index listing: ![](cnote.gif). When this icon is\npresent on a page, or added after a given file, it indicates that the file has\ncopyright issues which you need to consider before using it (particularly for\ncommercial purposes). The absence of this icon indicates that we believe that\nthe file is in the public domain.\n\nFiles marked [External Site] may be copyrighted and have other restrictions on\ntheir use. Consult the particular sites' policy before using these files.\n\nSome files are copyrighted because they are original material produced\nespecially for sacred-texts. This includes index files, the sub-section\ngraphics and any of the descriptive material. These files, graphics and text\nmay not be reproduced in any form without the permission of the copyright\nholder, J.B. Hare. These files will have explicit copyright notices.\n\nAll copyrighted images at this site have explicit copyright notices, either\ndirectly underneath the graphic or at the bottom of the page. If you want to\nuse any of these files, you **must** [contact J.B. Hare](http://www.sacred-\ntexts.com/contact.htm) to obtain copyright clearance.\n\nIf an image does _not_ have such a notice, it _may_ be in the public domain.\n\nNote: the Javascript Tarot reader and all associated HTML files is likewise\ncopyrighted material. You must obtain permission from the copyright holder,\nJ.B. Hare, if you wish to include this program in another website or a\ncommercial product.\n\nIf you have any other questions about copyright issues at this site, [please\nemail us.](http://www.sacred-texts.com/contact.htm)\n\nThe [Sacred Texts FAQ](faq.htm) has more information about copyright issues at\nthis site. We recommend that you read it before email us, as it may answer\nyour questions.\n\n* * *\n\n####  How do you determine if a file is in the public domain in the United\nStates?\n\nSince my site is located in the United States, I follow US Copyright law.\n\nThis is my criteria for determining whether a work is in the public domain or\nnot. First of all:\n\n1\\. Anything prior to 1922 inclusive (i.e. published in 1922 or prior to 1922)\nis in the public domain.\n\n2\\. Anything published in the US between 1923 (inclusive) and 1963 (inclusive)\nis in the public domain if it was not renewed at the US copyright office 28\nyears after the date of publication.\n\nAnything else is not in the public domain, particularly books published\noutside the US after 1922.\n\nSo first you need to do some research. You need to answer two questions: 1)\nwas it published first in the United States? 2) What year was it published?\nThis is not always apparent from the copyright page of a book, particularly if\nyou are looking at a modern reprint of an older work.\n\nFirst I go to the MELVYL catalog (the University of California library\ncatalog, which has practically every book ever published--even the Dee\nNecronomicon!). Their web address is <http://melvyl.cdlib.org/>.\n\nI fill in the form and get the earliest publication for the book I'm trying to\nlocate.\n\nIf it's not there (or I don't see an early entry for it) I also check the\nLibrary of Congress (<http://catalog.loc.gov/>). If it's not there I check\nAlibris ([www.alibris.com](http://www.alibris.com/)) and ABEbooks\n([www.abebooks.com](http://www.abebooks.com)) for information about used\ncopies.\n\nIf it was first published in the US in or before 1922, it's in the public\ndomain.\n\nIf it was first published in the US after 1922, but in or before 1963, then I\ngo to the Catalog of Copyright Renewals\n(<http://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ccer/ccer.htm>).\n\nThis has a table with each year that something could be renewed (the year of\npublication plus 28 years) between 1922 and 1963.\n\nYou pick a year (say 1931) go to that page and find the particular pages with\nthe authors' name organized alphabetically. Works from 1931 could be renewed\nin 1958 and 1959. There are two pages for each alphabetic range. So there are\nfour pages total to download (they are in TIF format, so you can't view them\nin your browser, you need to download them to your hard drive and use a image\neditor to view them). These TIFs have been now been converted into searchable\ntext by Distributed Proofing and Project Gutenberg. This is broken down into\nfiles for each six-month period which can be downloaded via links at the CCR\nsite. However, it's still a good idea to check the page images as well.\n\nIf you find the book listed as renewed in one of these TIFs, then it's not in\nthe public domain.\n\nIf you don't find it in the TIFs for that particular renewal year, it is in\nthe public domain.\n\nIf there are no TIFs for that particular year at the Catalog of Copyright\nRenewals, then there is one last stop, the US Copyright Office search form\n(<http://www.copyright.gov/records/>). This only has renewals after 1978, so\nit is only conclusive for books published after 1950 or so (since the book\nneeded to be renewed in the 28th year after publication). There are some\nentries that go back further. So consulting this database can be inconclusive.\n\nIf it was published mid-50s to 1963 and not listed here at all then it's\nprobably public domain.\n\nIf there is a listing at the copyright office, you have to scrutinize it a\nbit.\n\nIn some cases a book has an entry in the database because some overzealous\npublisher filed a claim on some new material on an older public domain book,\nin that case the record will state that the application only applies to NEW\nMATERIAL. If you omit that from the etext, you're probably in good shape. This\nis why I check for the earliest date of publication first. It's usually\napparent what is 'New Material'.\n\nIf you want to get a conclusive determination, I recommend that you contact\nThompson and Thompson, 1-800-356-8630, a legal firm in Washington DC which\nspecializes in intellectual property. Ask for their $90 special renewal\nsearches. They go to the copyright office on foot, and about a week later will\nemail (and/or fax and send by postal mail, if you wish) you a comprehensive\nreport of any traces they find of a registration or renewal. You _can_ have\nthe copyright office do this but it will cost you quite a bit more and it\ntakes months. If this search turns up a renewal, it's not in the public\ndomain, otherwise, it's in the public domain. For instance, this is how I\nnailed down the public domain status of 'The Flying Saucers are Real' and 'The\nKumulipo'.\n\nHowever, if it was first published between 1923 and 1964 inclusive, and\nrenewed in a timely fashion, it's locked up for a good 95 years by current\ncopyright law. Forget about it appearing on the Internet unless you can track\ndown the author and their heirs and get permission; obviously this could be\nexpensive and time consuming.  \n  \n---  \n|  |  [![](cdshop/img/t_istadvd.jpg)  \nNow Shipping!
