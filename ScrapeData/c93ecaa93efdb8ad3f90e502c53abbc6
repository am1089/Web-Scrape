Vyasa said :-- O King Janamejaya! Once on a time, on account of an evil\nturn of Fate (Karma) of the human beings, Indra did not rain on this earth for\nfifteen years. Owing to want of rain, the famine appeared horribly; and almost\nall the beings lost their lives. No one could count in every house the number\nof the dead persons. Out of hunger the people began to eat horses; some began\nto eat bears and pigs, some began to eat the dead bodies while some others\ncarried on any how their lives. The people were so much distressed with hunger\nthat the mother did not refrain from eating her baby child and the husband did\nnot refrain from eating his wife. O King! The Brahma _n_ as then united and\nafter due discussion, came to the conclusion that they would go to the hermit\nGautama who would be able to remove their distress. So all of them wanted to\ngo quickly to the hermitage of the Muni Gautama. They began to say :-- \xc2\x93We\nhear that there is no famine in the hermitage of Gautama. Various persons are\nrunning there from various quarters.\xc2\x94 Thus coming to a conclusion, the Brahma\n_n_ as went to the Gautama\xc2\x92s \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama with their cows, servants and relations.\nSome went from the east; some from the south; some from the west, and some\nfrom the north. Thus from various\n\n\n\np. 1170\n\n\n\nquarters the people flocked there. Seeing the Brahma _n_ as coming there, the\nRi _s_ i Gautama bowed down to them and gave them a cordial welcome and served\nthem with seats, etc. When all took their seats and became calm and quiet,\nGautama enquired about their welfare and the cause of their arrival. They\ndescribed everything about the dire famine and their own states and expressed\ntheir deep regret. Seeing them very much distressed, the Muni gave them word\nnot to have any fear; he said :-- \xc2\x93I am today become blessed by the arrival of\nthe great ascetics and honourable persons like you. I am your servant. You\nconsider all my houses as yours. Be quite comfortable. Bear no uneasiness.\nWhen your servant is alive, what fear do your entertain and whom do you fear?\nWhen the demerits are transformed into good merits by your mere sight, and\nwhen you have blessed my house with the dust of your holy feet, then who is\nmore blessed than me? O Vipras! Kindly perform your Sandhyas, and Japams and\nrest here at ease.\xc2\x94 Vyasa said :-- O King Janamejaya! Thus consoling the\nBrahma _n_ as, the Ri _s_ i Gautama began to worship the Gayatri Devi with\nrapt devotional trance. \xc2\x93O Devi Gayatri! Obeisance to Thee! Thou art the Great\nVidya, the Mother of the Vedas, Higher than the Highest; Thou art Vyarhiti\nrepresented by the Mantra \xc2\x91Om Bhur Bhuva _h_ Sva _h, \xc2\x92_ O Mother! Thou art the\nstate of equilibrium, i.e., the Turiya; Thou art of of the Form of Hrim; Thou\nart Svaha and Svadha; Thou grantest the desires of the Bhaktas. Thou art the\nWitness of the three states, Jagrat (waking), Svapna (dreaming) and Su _s_\nupti (deep sleep). Thou art the Turiya and Sachchidananda Brahma. O Devi! Thou\nresident in the Solar Orb and appearest as a ruddy girl in the morning, an\nyouthful maiden at noon and a black old woman in the evening. O Devi!\nObeisance to Thee! Now shew favour on us at this severe famine time when all\nthe beings are well nigh on the way to destruction.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n21-40. Thus praised and worshipped, the World-Mother appeared and gave to the\nRi _s_ i one vessel (cup) full to the brim by which every one can he fed and\nnourished. The Mother told the Muni :-- \xc2\x93This full vessel, given by me to you\nwill yield whatever you wish.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the Devi Gayatri, Higher than the\nHighest, vanished. Then, according to the wish of the Muni, came out from that\ncup, mountains of cooked rice, various curries and sweetmeats, lots of grass\nand fodder, silken clothings, various ornaments and various articles and\nvessels for sacrificial purposes. In fact whatever the Muni Gautama wished,\nthat came out of the brimful cup, given by the Devi Gayatri. Then the Muni\nGautama called the other Munis that came there and gave them wealth, grains,\nclothing, ornament, and the sacrificial ladles and spoons and cows and\nbuffaloes for the sacrificial purposes. The\n\n\n\np. 1171\n\n\n\nMunis then assembled and performed various yaj\xc3\xb1as. The place all round, then\nflourished and became so much prosperous that it looked like a second heaven.\nIn fact whatever fair and beautiful there exist in the Trilokas, all came from\nthe brimful cup given by the Devi Gayatri. At this time the Munis, with\nsandalpaste all over on their bodies, and decorated with very bright ornaments\nlooked like the gods and their wives looked like goddesses. Daily utsabs began\nto be held in in the \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama of Gautama. Nowhere were seen any diseases or\ndacoities and there was no fear from any such things. Gradually the \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama\xc2\x92s\nboundary extended to one hundred Yojanas (4 hundred miles). Hearing this\ngreatness of Gautama, many persons came there from various quarters. And the\nMuni Gautama, too, gave them words, \xc2\x93cast away fear\xc2\x94 and fed them. The Devas,\non the other hand, became very much satisfied by the various Yaj\xc3\xb1as and\nextolled the Muni\xc2\x92s greatness. So much so, that the famous Indra, the Lord of\nthe Devas, came in the midst of the assembly and extolled his greatness, thus\n:-- \xc2\x93This Gautama has fulfilled all our wishes and has verily become a Kalpa\nVrik _s_ a (celestial tree yielding all desires). If this man had not done\nsuch things, in this hard famine time, we would not have got the Havih offered\nin sacrifices and the prospect of our lives would have been at stake.\xc2\x94 O King\nJanamejaya! Thus the Muni Gautama fed and nourished for twelve years all the\nMunis, like his sons and that place came to be recognised as the chief centre\n(the Head Quarters) of the Gayatri Devi. Even today, all the Munis perform\nwith devotion the Pura _s_ acharanams and worship thrice the Bhagavati Gayatri\nDevi. Even today the Devi is there seen as a girl in the morning, as a\nyouthful maiden at noon, as an old woman in the evening. Then, once on a time,\nNarada, of best conduct, came there playing on his great lute and singing in\ntune the highest glories of Gayatri and took his seat in the assembly of the\nMunis.\n\n\n\n41-62. Seeing the tranquil hearted Narada coming there, Gautama and the other\nMunis received him duly and worshipped him with the Padya and Arghya. In\ncourse of conversation he began to describe the glories of Gautama and said\n:-- \xc2\x93O Best of Munis! I have heard from the mouth of Indra, in the assembly of\nthe Devas, your glories as to your supporting and feeding the pure-hearted\nMunis and I have come to see you. By the Grace of S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavati Gayatri Devi,\nyou have now become blessed. There is no doubt in this.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the\nDevar _s_ i Narada entered into the temple of the Devi Gayatri and with eyes\ngladdened by love, saw the Devi there and offered due hymns in praise of Her\nand then ascended to the Heavens. Here, on the other hand, the Brahma _n_ as\nthat were fed by Gautama, became jealous at so much honour offered\n\n\n\np. 1172\n\n\n\nto Gautama and tried their best so that no further honour be paid to him. They\nfurther settled not to stay any longer in his \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama, when the next good\nharvest season comes. (Thus his glories will wane). O King! Some days passed\nwhen good rains fell and there was an abundance of crops everywhere and the\nfamine ended. Hearing this, all the Brahmi _n_ s united, Alas! O King! to\ncurse the Gautama. Oh! Their fathers and mothers are blessed in whom do not\narise such feelings of jealousy! This all is the wonderful play of the\npowerful Time; it cannot be expressed by any person. O King! These Brahmi _n_\ns created, by Maya, an aged cow, who was to die and pushed her in the\nsacrificial hall of the Muni Gautama at the time of the Homa ceremony. Seeing\nthat cow entering into the enclosure where the Homa was being performed,\nGautama cried out \xc2\x93Hoom Hoom\xc2\x94 when the cow fell there and died. And the other\nBrahma _n_ as instantly cried out \xc2\x93Look! Look! The wicked Gautama has killed\nthe cow.\xc2\x94 Seeing this inconceivable event, Gautama was greatly nonplussed and,\ncompleting his Homa ceremony, entered into Samadhi and began to think the\ncause of it. Then, coming to know that this has been concocted by the Maya of\nthe Brahmi _n_ s, he became angry like Rudra at the time of dissolution; his\neyes were reddened and he cursed the Ri _s_ is, thus :-- Oh vile Brahmi _n_ s!\nWhen you are ready to cause mischief to me unjustly then let you be averse to\nmeditate and do the japam of the Devi Gayatri, the Mother of the Vedas. For\nyour this act, never you will be eager to perform any Vedic sacrificial acts\nor any action concerning thereof. There is no doubt in this. You will be\nalways averse to the mantra of S\xc2\x92iva or the Tantra of S\xc2\x92iva. You will be\nalways averse to Mula Prakriti S\xc2\x92ri Devi, to Her Dhyanam, mantra, to any\nconversation regarding Her; to the visiting of Her place or Temple, to do\nworship and other ceremonies to Her, to see the Grand Festivals of the Devi,\nto singing the names and glories of the Devi, to sit before the Devi and to\nadore Her.\n\n\n\n63-81. O vile Brahma _n_ as! You will be always averse to see the festivals of\nS\xc2\x92iva, to worship S\xc2\x92iva, to Rudrak _s_ a, to the Bel leaves, and to the holy\nBha _s_ ma (ashes). You will be wholly indifferent to practise the right ways\nof living as presented in the Vedas and Smritis, to preserve your conduct good\nand to observe the path of knowledge to Advaita J\xc3\xb1anam, to practise restraint\nof senses and continence, to the daily practices of Sandhya Bandanam, to\nperforming the Agnihotra ceremonies, to the study of the Vedas according to\none\xc2\x92s own S\xc2\x92akha or to the daily studies thereof as to teach those things or\nto give, as gifts, cows, etc., or to perform the S\xc2\x92raddhas of the fathers,\netc., or to perform Krichchra Chandraya _n_ a and other penances. O Vile\nBrahma _n_ as! As you are ready to do these mean things, you will have to\nsuffer for this that you will desist from worshipping the Most\n\n\n\np. 1173\n\n\n\nAdorable S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavati Devi and that you will worship the other Devas with\nfaith and devotion and hold on your bodies S\xc2\x92amkha, Chakra and other signs.\nYou will follow the Kapalikas, Bauddha S\xc2\x92astras and other heretics. You will\nsell your father, mother, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters and even your\nwives too!\n\n\n\nYou will sell the Vedas, Tirthas, and your Dharma. You will not feel ashamed\nin any way to sell all these. You will certainly have faith in Kapalika and\nBauddha opinions, Pa\xc3\xb1charatras and Kama S\xc2\x92astras. O vile Brahma _na_ s! You\nwill not hesitate to go to your mother, daughters or sisters and you will\nalways be licentious with others\xc2\x92 wives and spend your time in that. This is\nnot to you only but to the women and men, all that will come in your families.\nLet the Gayatri Devi be always indignant with you and let you all go in the\nend to the Andha Kupa hells, etc. Vyasa said :-- O Janamejaya! Thus taking the\nwater symbolising the true rules and laws of creation, and cursing the Brahma\n_n_ as, the Muni Gautama went hastily to see the Gayatri Devi and, on arriving\nat the temple there bowed down to Her. The Devi, too, became surprised to see\ntheir actions. O King! Even to day Her Lotus Face looks similarly astonished!\n\n\n\n82-90. Then the Gayatri Devi told Gautama with amazement :-- \xc2\x93O Gautama! The\nvenom of the snake does not become less if you feed the serpents with milk; so\nnever mind all these things; the Karmas take their peculiar turns; it is hard\nto say when will happen what things. Now be peaceful. Do not be sorry.\xc2\x94\nHearing these words of the Devi, Gautama bowed down to Her and went thence to\nhis own \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama. Here, on the other hand, the Brahma _n_ as forgot everything\ndue to the curse of Gautama, of the Vedas and the Gayatri Mantra. They then\nbegan to look at this event with wonder as unique and extraordinary. All\nunited they afterwards repented and going before Gautama, fell prostrate at\nhis feet. But they could not speak any word out of shame. Only they said\nfrequently :-- \xc2\x93Be pleased, be pleased with us.\xc2\x94 When all the assembly of the\nBrahma _n_ as prayed to him for favour and grace, the Muni Gautama took pity\non them and replied. My word will never turn out false. You will have to\nremain in Kumbhipaka hell upto the time when S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a will take his\nincarnation. Then you will be born in the earth in the Kali age and whatever I\nhave uttered will exactly come unto you. And if you are in earnest to avert my\ncurse then go and worship the Lotus Feet of S\xc2\x92ri Gayatri Devi. The is no other\nremedy.\n\n\n\np. 1174\n\n\n\n91-100. Vyasa said :-- Thus dismissing the Brahma _n_ as, Gautama Muni thought\nthat all these occurred as a result of Prarabdha Karma and he became calm and\nquiet. For this reason, after S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a Maharaja ascended to the\nHeavens, when the Kali age came, those cursed Brahma _n_ as got out of the\nKumbhipaka hell and took their births in this earth as Brahmi _n_ s, devoid of\nthe three Sandhyas, devoid of the devotion to Gayatri, devoid of faith in the\nVedas, advocating the heretics\xc2\x92 opinion and unwilling to perform Agnihotra and\nother religious sacrifices and duties and they were devoid of Svadha and\nSvaha. They forgot entirely the Unmanifested Mula Prakriti Bhagavati. Some of\nthem began to mark on their bodies various heretical signs, e.g., Taptamudra,\netc.; some became Kapalikas; some became Kaulas; some Bauddhas and some\nJainas. Many of them, though learned, became lewd and addicted to other\xc2\x92s\nwives and engaged themselves in vain and bad disputations. For these, they\nwill have to go again surely to the Kumbhipaka hell. So O King! Worship with\nyour heart and soul S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavati Parames\xc2\x92vari Devi. The worship of Vi _sn_ u\nor S\xc2\x92iva is not constant (to be done everyday); only the worship of S\xc2\x92akti is\nto be constantly performed. For this reason whoever does not worship S\xc2\x92akti is\nsure to fall. Thus I have answered all your questions. Now I shall describe\nthe highest and most beautiful place, Ma _n_ idvipa of the Primal Force\nBhagavati, the Deliverer from this bondage of world. Listen.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Ninth Chapter of the Twelfth Book on the cause of S\xc2\x92raddha in\nother Devas than the Devi Gayatri in the Mahapura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi\nBhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 10](bk12ch10.htm)\n\n'
