THE Veda is the source of the sacred law, 1\n\n2\\. And the tradition and practice of those who know the (Veda).\n\n3\\. Transgression of the law and violence ate observed (in the case) of\n(those) great (men); but both are without force (as precedents) on account of\nthe weakness of the men of later ages. 3\n\n4\\. If (authorities) of equal force are conflicting, (either may be followed\nat) pleasure.\n\n5\\. The initiation of a Brahma _n_ a (shall ordinarily take place) in his\neighth year;\n\np. 176\n\n6\\. (It may also be performed) in the ninth or fifth (years) for the\nfulfilment of (some particular) wish. 6\n\n7\\. The number of years (is to be calculated) from conception. 7\n\n8\\. That (initiation) is the second birth. 8\n\n9\\. The (person) from whom he receives that (Sacrament is called) the \xc3\x82 _k_\narya (teacher). 9\n\n10\\. And (the same title is also bestowed) in consequence of the teaching of\nthe Veda. 10\n\n11\\. (The initiation) of a Kshatriya (shall ordinarily take place) in the\neleventh (year after conception), and that of a Vai _s_ ya in the twelfth. 11\n\n12\\. Up to the sixteenth year the time for the Savitri of a Brahma _n_ a has\nnot passed, 12\n\n13\\. Nor (for the initiation) of a Kshatriya up to the twentieth (year). 13\n\n14\\. (And the limit for that) of a Vai _s_ ya (extends) two years beyond (the\nlatter term).\n\n15\\. The girdles (worn by students) shall be strings of Mu _\xc3\xb1_ _g_ a grass, a\nbow-string, or a (wool) thread, according to the order (of the castes). 15\n\n16\\. (Their upper garments shall be) skins of black-bucks, spotted deer, (or)\nhe-goats. 16\n\np. 177\n\n17\\. Hempen or linen cloth, the (inner) bark (of trees), and woollen blankets\n(may be worn as low garments by students) of all (castes), 17\n\n18\\. And undyed cotton cloth.\n\n19\\. Some (declare that it) even (may be dyed) red. 19\n\n20\\. (In that case the garment) of a Brahma _n_ a (shall be dyed with a red\ndye) produced from a tree,\n\n21\\. (And those of students) of the other two (castes shall be) dyed with\nmadder or turmeric.\n\n22\\. The staff (carried by a student) of the Brahma _n_ a (caste shall be)\nmade of Biliva or Pala _s_ a wood. 22\n\n23\\. Staves made of A _s_ vattha or Pilu wood (are fit) for (students of) the\nremaining (two castes).\n\n24\\. Or (a staff cut from a tree) that is fit to be used at a sacrifice (may\nbe carried by students) of all (castes). 24\n\n25\\. (The staves must be) unblemished, bent (at the top) like a sacrificial\npost, and covered by their bark. 25\n\n26\\. They shall reach the crown of the head, the forehead, (or) the tip of the\nnose (according to the caste of the wearer). 26\n\np. 178\n\n27\\. (It is) optional (for students) to shave (their heads), to wear the hair\ntied in a braid, (or) to keep (merely) a lock on the crown of the head tied in\na braid (shaving the other portions of the head). 27\n\n28\\. If he becomes impure while holding things in his hands, he shall (purify\nhimself) by sipping water without laying (them on the ground). 28\n\np. 179\n\n29\\. (As regards) the purification of things, (objects) made of metal must be\nscoured, those made of clay should be thoroughly heated by fire, those made of\nwood must be planed, and (cloth) made of thread should be washed. 29\n\n30\\. (Objects made of) stone, jewels, shells, (or) mother-of-pearl (must be\ntreated) like those made of metal. 30\n\n31\\. (Objects made of) bone and mud (must be treated) like wood. 31\n\np. 180\n\n32\\. And scattering (earth taken from a pure spot is another method of\npurifying defiled) earth. 32\n\n33\\. Ropes, chips (of bamboo), and leather (must be treated) like garments. 33\n\n34\\. Or (objects) that have been defiled very much may be thrown away. 34\n\n35\\. Turning his face to the east or to the north, he shall purify himself\nfrom personal defilement. 35\n\n36\\. Seated in a pure place, placing his right arm between his knees,\narranging his dress (or his 36\n\np. 181\n\nsacrificial cord) in the manner required for a sacrifice to the gods, he\nshall, after washing his hands up to the wrist, three or four times, silently,\nsip water that reaches his heart; twice wipe (his lips); sprinkle his feet and\n(his head); touch the cavities in the head (severally) with (certain fingers\nof his) right hand; (and finally) place (all the fingers) on the crown of his\nhead and (on the navel).\n\n37\\. After sleeping, dining, and sneezing (he shall) again (sip water though\nhe may have done so before). 37\n\n38\\. (Remnants of food) adhering to the teeth (do not make the eater impure as\nlittle) as his teeth, except if he touches them with his tongue. 38\n\n39\\. Some (declare, that such remnants do not defile) before they fall (from\ntheir place). 39\n\n40\\. If they do become detached, he should know that he is purified by merely\nswallowing them, as (in the case of) saliva. 40\n\np. 182\n\n41\\. Drops (of saliva) failing from the mouth do not cause impurity, except if\nthey fall on a limb of the body. 41\n\n42\\. Purification (from defilement) by unclean substances (has been effected)\nwhen the stains and the (bad) smell have been removed. 42\n\n43\\. That (should be done) by first (using) water and (afterwards) earth, 43\n\n44\\. When urine, faeces, or semen fall on a (limb) and when (a limb) is\nstained (by food) during meals (water should be sipped). 44\n\n45\\. And in case the Veda ordains (a particular manner of purification, it\nmust be performed according to the precept). 45\n\n46\\. Taking hold with (his right) hand of the left 46\n\np. 183\n\nhand (of his teacher), but leaving the thumb free, (the pupil) shall address\nhis teacher, (saying): \'Venerable Sir, recite!\'\n\n47\\. He shall fix his eyes and his mind on the (teacher). 47\n\n48\\. He shall touch with Ku _s_ a grass the (seat of the) vital airs. 48\n\n49\\. He shall thrice restrain his breath for (the space of) fifteen moments;\n49\n\n50\\. And he shall seat himself on (blades of Ku _s_ a grass) the tops of which\nare turned toward the east. 50\n\n51\\. The five Vyah _ri_ tis must (each) be preceded by (the syllable) Om and\nend with Satya. 51\n\n52\\. (Every) morning the feet of the teacher must be embraced (by the pupil),\n52\n\n53\\. And both at the beginning and at the end of a lesson in the Veda.\n\n54\\. After having received permission, the pupil 54\n\np. 184\n\nshall sit down to the right (of his teacher), turning his face towards the\neast or towards the north,\n\n55\\. And the Savitri must be recited; 55\n\n56\\. (All these acts must be performed) at the beginning of the instruction in\nthe Veda. 56\n\n57\\. The syllable Om (must precede the recitation of) other (parts of the\nVeda) also, 57\n\n58\\. If (any one) passes between (the teacher and the pupil) the worship (of\nthe teacher must be performed) once more. 58\n\n59\\. If a dog, an ichneumon, a snake, a frog, (or) a cat (pass between the\nteacher and the pupil) a three days\' fast and a journey (are necessary). 59\n\np. 185\n\n60\\. (In case the same event happens) with other (animals, the pupil) must\nthrice restrain his breath and eat clarified butter, 60\n\n61\\. And (the same expiation must be performed), if (unwittingly) a lesson in\nthe Veda has been given on the site of a burial-ground. 61\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[175:1](sbe0265.htm#fr_796)-2. **I**. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 1, 1-2.\n\n[175:3](sbe0265.htm#fr_797) \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 13, 8-10. Instances of\ntransgressions of the law are the adultery of Kataka and Bharadva _g_ a,\nVasish _th_ a\'s marriage with the _K_ a _n_ _d_ ali Akshamala, Rama _G_\namadagnya\'s murder of his mother. Haradatta explains the term \'avara,\'\ntranslated by \'men of later ages,\' to mean \'men like ourselves\' (asmadadi). In\nhis comment on the parallel passage of \xc3\x82pastamba be renders it by idanintana,\n\'belonging to our times;\' and in his notes on \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 5, 4, he\nsubstitutes arva _k_ ina kaliyugavartin, \'men of modern times living in the\nKaliyuga.\' The last explanation seems to me the most accurate, if it is\ndistinctly kept in mind that in the times of Gautama the Kaliyuga was not a\ndefinite period of calculated duration, but the Iron Age of sin as opposed to\nthe happier times when justice still dwelt on earth.\n\n[176:6](sbe0265.htm#fr_798) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 1, 20-21.\n\n[176:7](sbe0265.htm#fr_799) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 1, 19.\n\n[176:8](sbe0265.htm#fr_800) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 1, 17-8.\n\n[176:9](sbe0265.htm#fr_801) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 1, 14.\n\n[176:10](sbe0265.htm#fr_802) Manu II, 140; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 34.\n\n[176:11](sbe0265.htm#fr_803) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 1, 19.\n\n[176:12](sbe0265.htm#fr_804) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 11 1, 27. Savitri, literally the\n_Ri_ k sacred to Savitri, is here used as an equivalent for upanayana,\ninitiation, because one of the chief objects of the ceremony is to impart to\nthe neophyte the Mantra sacred to Savitri, Rig-veda III, 62, 10.\n\n[176:13](sbe0265.htm#fr_805)-14. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 1, 27.\n\n[176:15](sbe0265.htm#fr_806) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 33-36.\n\n[176:16](sbe0265.htm#fr_807) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 3, 3-6.\n\n[177:17](sbe0265.htm#fr_808) Haradatta explains _k_ ira, the inner bark of a\ntree, by \'made of Ku _s_ a grass and the like.\' Regarding dresses made of Ku\n_s_ a grass, See the Petersburg Dict. s.v. Ku _s_ a _k_ ira. Kira may also\nmean \'rags,\' such as were worn by Sannyasins (see below, III, 19) and Bauddha\nascetics.\n\n[177:19](sbe0265.htm#fr_809)-21. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 41-I, 1, 3, 2.\n\n[177:22](sbe0265.htm#fr_810) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 38.\n\n[177:24](sbe0265.htm#fr_811) \'Because the term "fit to be used at a sacrifice"\nis employed, the Vibhitaka and the like (unclean trees) are excluded.\'--\nHaradatta. Regarding the Vibhitaka, see Report of Tour in Ka _s_ mir, Journal\nBombay Br. Roy. As. Soc. XXXIV A, p. 8.\n\n[177:25](sbe0265.htm#fr_812) Manu II, 47. \'Unblemished means uninjured by\nworms and the like\'--Haradatta.\n\n[177:26](sbe0265.htm#fr_813) Manu II, 46.\n\n[178:27](sbe0265.htm#fr_814) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 1, 2, 31-32. The above translation\nfollows the reading of my MSS. mu _n_ _d_ a _g_ a _t_ ila _s_ ikha _g_ a _t_ a\nva, which seems more in accordance with the Sutra style. It must, however, be\nunderstood that the arrangement of the hair is not regulated by the individual\nchoice of the student, but by the custom of his family, school, or country. In\nthe commentary, as given by one of my MSS., it is stated the custom of shaving\nthe whole head prevailed among the _Kh_ andogas. Max Muller, History of\nAncient Sanskrit Literature, p. 53; Weber, Indische Studien, X, 95.\n\n[178:28](sbe0265.htm#fr_815) The above translation agrees with Professor\nStenzler\'s text and Manu V, 143. But according to Haradatta the meaning of.\nthe Sutra is not so simple. His explanation is as follows: \'If while holding\nthings in his hands he becomes impure, i.e. he is defiled by urine, faeces,\nleavings of food, and the like (impurities) which are causes for sipping\nwater, then he shall sip water after placing those things on the ground. This\nrefers to uncooked food, intended to be eaten. And thus Vasish _th_ a (III, 4,\n3, Benares edition) declares: "If he who is occupied with eatables touches any\nimpure substance, then he shall place that thing on the ground, sip water, and\nafterwards again use it." But the following text of another Sm _ri_ ti, "A\nsubstance becomes pure by being sprinkled with water after having been placed\non the ground," refers to cooked food, such as boiled rice and the like. Or\n(the above Sutra may mean), "If he becomes impure while holding things in his\nhands, then he shall sip water without laying them on the ground." And thus\nManu (V, 143) says: "He who carries in any manner anything in his hands and is\ntouched by an impure substance shall cleanse himself by sipping water without\nlaying his burden down." This rule refers to things not destined to be eaten,\nsuch as garments. And in the (above) Sutra the words, "He who becomes impure\nshall sip water," must be taken as one sentence, and (the whole), " If while\nholding things in his hands he becomes impure, p. 179 he shall sip water\nwithout laying (them) down," must be taken as a second.\'\n\nThough it may be doubted if the yogavibhaga, or \' division of the\nconstruction,\' proposed by Haradatta, is admissible, still it seems to me not\nimprobable that Gautama intended his Sutra to be taken in two different ways.\nFor, if according to the ancient custom it is written without an Avagraha and\nwithout separating the words joined by Sandhi, dravyabasta u _k_ _kh_ ish _t_\nonidhaya _k_ amet, the latter group may either stand for u _k_ _kh_ ish _t_ o\nnidhaya a _k_ amet or for u _k_ _kh_ is _t_ o anidhaya a _k_ amet. As the\nSutra-karas aim before all things at brevity, the Sutra may have to be read\nboth ways. If that had to be done, the correct translation would be: \'If while\nholding things in his hands, be becomes impure, he shall (purify himself by)\nsipping water, either laying (his burden) down (or) not laying it down, (as\nthe case may require.)\'\n\n[179:29](sbe0265.htm#fr_816) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 17, 10-12; Manu V, 115, 122.\n\n[179:30](sbe0265.htm#fr_817) Manu V, 111-112.\n\n[179:31](sbe0265.htm#fr_818) \'Bone, i.e. ivory and the like. Mud, i.e. (the\nmud floor of) a house and the like. The purification of these two is the same\nas that of wood, i.e. by scraping (or planing). How is it proper that, since\nthe author has declared (Sutra 29) that objects made of wood shall be purified\nby planing, the expression "like wood" should be substituted (in this Sutra)?\n(The answer is that), as the author uses the expression "like wood," when he\nought to have said "like objects made of wood," he indicates thereby that the\nmanner of purification is the same for the material as for the object made\nthereof.\'--Haradatta. The p. 180 Sutra is, therefore, a so-called _G_ _\xc3\xb1_\napaka, intended to reveal the existence of a general rule or paribhasha which\nhas not been given explicitly.\n\n[180:32](sbe0265.htm#fr_819) \'Scattering over, i.e. heaping on (earth) after\nbringing it from another spot is an additional method of purifying earth. With\nregard to this matter Vasish _th_ a (III, 57) says: "Earth is purified by\nthese four (methods, viz.) by digging, burning scraping, being trodden on by\ncows, and, fifthly, by being smeared with cowdung."\'--Haradatta.\n\nWhat Haradatta and probably Gautama mean, is that the mud floors of houses,\nverandahs, and spots of ground selected for sitting on, if defiled, should be\nscraped, and that afterwards fresh earth should be scattered over the spot\nthus cleansed. See, however, Manu V, 125, who recommends earth for the\npurification of other things also. The Sutra may also be interpreted so as to\nagree with his rule.\n\n[180:33](sbe0265.htm#fr_820) \'Chips (vidala), i.e. something made of chips of\nratan-cane or bamboo, or, according to others, something made of feathers.\'--\nHaradatta.\n\n[180:34](sbe0265.htm#fr_821) \'The word "or" is used in order to exclude the\nalternative (i.e. the methods of purification described above).\'--Haradatta.\nFor the explanation of the expression \'very much\' Haradatta refers to Vasish\n_th_ a III, 58, with which Manu V, 123 may be compared.\n\n[180:35](sbe0265.htm#fr_822) \'The alternative (position) depends on the\npleasure of the performer.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[180:36](sbe0265.htm#fr_823) My MSS. more conveniently make five Sutras of\nProfessor Stenzler\'s one Sutra. The divisions have been marked in the\ntranslation by semicolons.\n\n_a_. \'How many times? Three times or four times; the alternative p. 181\ndepends upon the pleasure of the performer. Another (commentator says): When,\naccording to a special rule of the Vedas the sipping must be accompanied by\nthe recitation of sacred texts, then the act shall be repeated four times,\nelse three times.\'--Haradatta.\n\n_b_. The custom of touching the lips twice is noted as the opinion of some, by\n\xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 4.\n\n_c_. \'"Sprinkle his feet and." On account of the word "and" he shall sprinkle\nhis head also.\'--Haradatta.\n\n_d_. \'"Touch the cavities, &c." Here the word "and" indicates that each organ\nis to be touched separately.\'--Haradatta. Regarding the manner of touching,\nsee \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 5 and 7 note.\n\n_e_. \'"(And finally) place," &c. Because the word "and" is used, he shall\ntouch the navel and the head with all the fingers\'--Haradatta. Regarding the\nwhole \xc3\x82 _k_ amanakalpa, see \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 1 seq.\n\n[181:37](sbe0265.htm#fr_824) Manu V, 145.\n\n[181:38](sbe0265.htm#fr_825) Manu V, 141.\n\n[181:39](sbe0265.htm#fr_826) Vasish _th_ a III, 41.\n\n[181:40](sbe0265.htm#fr_827) \'As the author ought to have said, "If they\nbecome detached, p. 182 he is purified by merely swallowing them," the\naddition of the words "he should know" and "as in the case of saliva" is\nintended to indicate that in the case of saliva, too, he becomes pure by\nswallowing it, and that purification by sipping need not be considered\nnecessary.\'--Haradatta. This Sutra consists of the second half of a verse,\nquoted by Baudhayana I, 5, 8, 25, and Vasish _th_ a III, 41.\n\n[182:41](sbe0265.htm#fr_828) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 12.\n\n[182:42](sbe0265.htm#fr_829) In explanation of the term amedhya, \'unclean\nsubstances,\' Haradatta quotes Manu V, 135.\n\n[182:43](sbe0265.htm#fr_830) Manu V, 134; see also \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 15.\n\n[182:44](sbe0265.htm#fr_831) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 5, 16, 14.\n\n[182:45](sbe0265.htm#fr_832) \'If the Veda ordains any particular manner of\npurification for any particular purpose, that alone must be adopted. Thus the\nsacrificial vessels called _k_ amasa, which have been stained by remnants of\nofferings, must be washed with water on the heap of earth called mar _g_\naliya.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[182:46](sbe0265.htm#fr_833) This and the following rules refer chiefly to the\nteaching of the Savitri, which forms part of the initiation. According to\nGobhila G _ri_ hya-sutra II, 10, 38, the complete sentence addressed to the\nteacher is, \'Venerable Sir, recite! May the worshipful one teach me the\nSavitri!\'\n\n[183:47](sbe0265.htm#fr_834) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 5, 23; I, 7, 6, 20; Manu II, 192.\n\n[183:48](sbe0265.htm#fr_835) \'The (seat of the) vital airs are the organs of\nsense located in the head.

Bhu _h_ ,\nBhuva _h_ , Sva _h_ , Satyam, Purusha _h_. Each of these is to be preceded by\nthe syllable Om. But they are to end with Purusha _h_ , which (in the above\nenumeration) occupies the fourth place.\'--Haradatta, See also Manu II, 75 seq.\n\n[183:52](sbe0265.htm#fr_839)-53. \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 5, 18-20.\n\n[183:54](sbe0265.htm#fr_840) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 2, 6, 24; Manu II, 193.

After the initiation follows the study of the Savitri. The\ntouching of the organs of sense and the other (acts mentioned) form part of\nthis (study). But the rules prescribed in the three Sutras, the first of which\nis Sutra 52, and the rule to direct the eye and mind towards the teacher\n(Sutra 47), must be constantly kept in mind. This decision is confirmed by the\nrules of other Sm _ri_ tis and of the G _ri_ hya-sutras.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[184:57](sbe0265.htm#fr_843) \xc3\x82pastamba I, 4, 13, 6-7.\n\n[184:58](sbe0265.htm#fr_844) \'The worship of the teacher (upasadana) consists\nin the performance of the acts prescribed in Sutras 46-57, with the exception\nof the study of the Savitri and the acts belonging to that. The meaning of the\nSutra is that, though the worship of the teacher may have already been\nperformed in the morning of that day, it must, nevertheless, be repeated for\nthe reason stated.\'--Haradatta.\n\n[184:59](sbe0265.htm#fr_845) \'A journey (vipravasa) means residence in some\nother place than the teacher\'s house.\'--Haradatta. The commentator adds that\nthe somewhat different rule, given by Manu IV, 126, may be reconciled with the\nabove, by referring the former to the study for the sake of remembering texts\nrecited by the teacher (dhara _n_ adhyayana), and the latter to the first\ninstruction in the sacred texts.\n\n[185:60](sbe0265.htm#fr_846) \'This penance must be performed by the pupil, not\nby the teacher.
