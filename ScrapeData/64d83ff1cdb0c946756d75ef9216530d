He thought: 'There are these worlds and the guardians of the worlds. Let\nme send forth food for them.' (1)\n\nHe brooded over the water 1. From the water thus brooded on, matter 2 (murti)\nwas born. And that matter which was born, that verily was food 3. (2)\n\n2\\. When this food (the object matter) had thus been sent forth, it wished to\nflee 4, crying and turning away. He (the subject) tried to grasp it by speech.\nHe could not grasp it by speech. If he had grasped it by speech, man would be\nsatisfied by naming food. (3)\n\nHe tried to grasp it by scent (breath). He could not grasp it by scent. If he\nhad grasped it by scent, man would be satisfied by smelling food. (4)\n\nHe tried to grasp it by the eye. He could not\n\np. 241\n\ngrasp it by the eye. If he had grasped it by the eye, man would be satisfied\nby seeing food. (5)\n\nHe tried to grasp it by the ear. He could not grasp it by the ear. If he had\ngrasped it by the ear, man would be satisfied by hearing food. (6)\n\nHe tried to grasp it by the skin. He could not grasp it by the skin. If he had\ngrasped it by the skin, man would be satisfied by touching food. (7)\n\nHe tried to grasp it by the mind. He could not grasp it by the mind. If he had\ngrasped it by the mind, man would be satisfied by thinking food. (8)\n\nHe tried to grasp it by the generative organ. He could not grasp it by the\norgan. If he had grasped it by the organ, man would be satisfied by sending\nforth food. (9)\n\nHe tried to grasp it by the down-breathing (the breath which helps to swallow\nfood through the mouth and to carry it off through the rectum, the\npayvindriya). He got it.\n\n3\\. Thus it is Vayu (the getter 1) who lays hold of food, and the Vayu is\nverily Annayu (he who gives life or who lives by food). (10)\n\n4\\. He thought: 'How can all this be without me?'\n\n5\\. And then he thought: 'By what way shall I get there 2?'\n\n6\\. And then he thought: 'If speech names, if scent smells, if the eye sees,\nif the ear hears, if the skin feels, if the mind thinks, if the off-breathing\ndigests, if the organ sends forth, then what am I?' (11)\n\np. 242\n\n7\\. Then opening the suture of the skull, he got in by that door.\n\n8\\. That door is called the Vid _ri_ ti (tearing asunder), the Nandana (the\nplace of bliss).\n\n9\\. There are three dwelling-places for him, three dreams; this dwelling-place\n(the eye), this dwelling-place (the throat), this dwelling-place (the heart)\n1. (12)\n\n10\\. When born (when the Highest Self had entered the body) he looked through\nall things, in order to see whether anything wished to proclaim here another\n(Self). He saw this person only (himself) as the widely spread Brahman. 'I saw\nit,' thus he said 2; (13)\n\nTherefore he was Ida _m_ -dra (seeing this).\n\n11\\. Being Ida _m_ dra by name, they call him Indra mysteriously. For the\nDevas love mystery, yea, they love mystery. (14)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[240:1](sbe01224.htm#fr_599) The water, as mentioned before, or the five\nelements.\n\n[240:2](sbe01224.htm#fr_600) Murti, for murtti, form, Colebrooke; a being of\norganised form, Roer; vrihiyavadirupa mushakadirupa _k_ a murti _h_ , i.e.\nvegetable food for men, animal food for cats, &c.\n\n[240:3](sbe01224.htm#fr_601) Offered food, i.e. objects for the Devatas and\nthe senses in the body.\n\n[240:4](sbe01224.htm#fr_602) Atya _g_ igha _m_ sat, ati _s_ ayena hantu _m_\ngantum ai _k_ _kh_ at. Saya _n_ a.\n\n[241:1](sbe01224.htm#fr_603) An attempt to derive vayu from vi, to get.\n\n[241:2](sbe01224.htm#fr_604) Or, by which of the two ways shall I get in, the\none way being from the top of the foot (cf. Ait. \xc3\x82r. II, 1, 4, 1), the other\nfrom the skull? Comm.\n\n[242:1](sbe01224.htm#fr_605) Passages like this must always have required an\noral interpretation, but it is by no means certain that the explanation given\nin the commentaries represents really the old traditional interpretation. Saya\n_n_ a explains the three dwelling-places as the right eye, in a state of\nwaking; as the throat, in a state of dreaming; as the heart, in a state of\nprofound sleep. _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara explains them as the right eye, the inner mind, and\nthe ether in the heart. Saya _n_ a allows another interpretation of the three\ndwelling-places being the body of the father, the body of the mother, and\none's own body. The three dreams or sleeps he explains by waking, dreaming,\nand profound sleep, and he remarks that waking too is called a dream as\ncompared with the true awakening, which is the knowledge of Brahman. In the\nlast sentence the speaker, when repeating three times 'this dwelling-place,'\nis supposed to point to his right eye, the throat, and the heart. This\ninterpretation is supported by a passage in the Brahma-upanishad, Netre _g_\nagarita _m_ vidyat ka _n_ _th_ e svapna _m_ samadi _s_ et, sushupta _m_ h _ri_\ndayasya tu.\n\n[242:2](sbe01224.htm#fr_606) In this passage, which is very obscure, _S_\na\xe1\xb9\x85kara fails us, either because, as \xc3\x82nanda _g_ \xc3\xb1ana says, he thought the text\nwas too easy to require any explanation, or because the writers of the MSS.\nleft out p. 243 the passage. \xc3\x82nanda _g_ \xc3\xb1ana explains: 'He looked through all\ncreatures, he identified himself with them, and thought he was a man, blind,\nhappy, &c.; or, as it is elsewhere expressed, he developed forms and names.\nAnd how did this mistake arise? Because he did not see the other, the true\nSelf;' or literally, 'Did he see the other Self?' which is only a figure of\nspeech to convey the meaning that he did not see it. The particle iti is then\nto be taken in a causal sense, (i. e. he did so, because what else could he\nhave wished to proclaim?) But he allows another explanation, viz. 'He\nconsidered all beings, whether they existed by themselves or not, and after\nhaving considered, he arrived at the conclusion, What shall I call different\nfrom the true Self?' The real difficulties, however, are not removed by these\nexplanations. First of all, we expect vavadisham before iti, and secondly,\nunless anyam refers to atmanam, we expect anyad. My own translation is\nliteral, but I am not certain that it conveys the true meaning. One might\nunderstand it as implying that the Self looked about through all things, in\norder to find out, 'What does wish to proclaim here another Self?' And when he\nsaw there was nothing which did not come from himself, then he recognised that\nthe Purusha, the person he had sent forth, or, as we should say, the person he\nhad created, was the developed Brahman, was the \xc3\x82tman, was himself. Saya _n_ a\nexplains vavadishat by vadishyami, but before iti the third person cannot well\nrefer to the subject of vyaikshat.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 5, 1](sbe01225.htm)\n\n"
