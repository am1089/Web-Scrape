Hymn to all magic and medicinal plants, used as a universal\nremedy.\n\n1\\. The plants that are brown, and those that are white; the red ones and the\nspeckled ones; the sable and the black plants, all (these) do we invoke.  \n2\\. May they protect this man from the disease sent by the gods, the herbs\nwhose father is the sky, whose mother is the earth, whose root is the ocean.  \n3\\. The waters and the heavenly plants are foremost; they have driven out from\nevery limb thy disease, consequent upon sin.  \n4\\. The plants that spread forth, those that are busby, those that have a\nsingle sheath, those that creep along, do I address; I call in thy behalf the\nplants that have shoots, those that have stalks, those that divide their\nbranches, those that are derived from all the gods, the strong (plants) that\nfurnish  \nlife to man.  \n5\\. With the might that is yours, ye mighty ones, with the power and strength\nthat is yours, with that do ye, O plants, rescue this man from this disease!  \nI now prepare a remedy.  \n6\\. The plants givala ('quickening'), na-gha-risha ('forsooth-no-harm'),\ngivanti ('living'), and the arundhati, which removes (disease), is full of\nblossoms, and rich in honey, do I call to exempt him from injury.  \n7\\. Hither shall come the intelligent (plants) that understand my speech, that\nwe may bring this man into safety out of misery!  \n8\\. They that are the food of Agni (the fire), the offspring of the waters,\nthat grow ever renewing themselves, the firm (plants) that bear a thousand\nnames, the healing (plants), shall be brought hither!  \n9\\. The plants, whose womb is the avaki (blyxa octandra), whose essence are\nthe waters, shall with their sharp horns thrust aside evil!  \n10\\. The plants which release, exempt from Varuna (dropsy), are strong, and\ndestroy poison; those, too, that remove (the disease) baldsa, and ward off\nwitchcraft shall come hither!'  \n11\\. The plants that have been bought, that are right potent, and are praised,\nshall protect in this village cow, horse, man, and cattle!  \n12\\. Honied are the roots of these herbs, honied their tops, honied their\nmiddles, honied their leaves, honied their blossoms; they share in honey, are\nthe food of immortality. May they yield ghee, and food, and cattle chief of\nall!  \n13\\. As many in number and in kind the plants here are upon the earth, may\nthey, furnished with a thousand leaves, release me from death and misery!  \n14\\. Tiger-like is the amulet (made of) herbs, a saviour, a protector against\nhostile schemes: may it drive off far away from us all diseases and the\nRakshas!  \n15\\. As if at the roar of the lion they start with fright, as if (at the roar)\nof fire they tremble before the (plants) that have been brought hither. The\ndiseases of cattle and men have been driven out by the herbs: let them pass\ninto navigable streams!  \n16\\. The plants release us from Agni Vaisvanara. Spreading over the earth, go\nye, whose king is the tree!  \n17\\. The plants, descended from Angiras, that grow upon the mountains and in\nthe plains, shall be for us rich in milk, auspicious, comforting to the heart!  \n18\\. The herbs which I know, and those which I see with my sight; the unknown,\nthose which we know, and those which we perceive to be charged with (power),--  \n19\\. All plants collectively shall note my words, that we may bring this man\ninto safety out of misfortune,--  \n20\\. The asvattha (ficus religiosa), and the darbha among the plants; king\nSoma, amrita (ambrosia) and the oblation; rice and barley, the two healing,\nimmortal children of heaven!  \n21\\. Ye arise: it is thundering and crashing, ye plants, since Parganya (the\ngod of rain) is favouring you, O children of Prisni (the spotted cloud), with\n(his) seed (water).  \n22\\. The strength of this amrita (ambrosia) do we crive this man to drink.\nMoreover, I prepare a remedy, that he may live a hundred years!  \n23\\. The boar knows, the ichneumon knows the healing plant. Those that the\nserpents and Gandharvas know, I call hither for help.  \n24\\. The plants, derived from the Angiras, which the eagles and the heavenly\nraghats (falcons) know, which the birds and the flamingos know, which all\nwinged (creatures) know, which all wild animals know, I call hither for help.  \n25\\. As many plants as the oxen and kine, as many as the goats and the sheep\nfeed upon, so many plants, when applied, shall furnish protection to thee!  \n26\\. As many (plants), as the human physicians know to contain a remedy, so\nmany, endowed with every healing quality, do I apply to thee!  \n27\\. Those that have flowers, those that have blossoms, those that bear fruit,\nand those that are without fruit, as if from the same mother they shall suck\nsap, to exempt this man from injury!  \n28\\. I have saved thee from a depth of five fathoms, and, too, from a depth of\nten fathoms; moreover, from the foot-fetter of Yama, and from every sin\nagainst the gods.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: VI, 96.
