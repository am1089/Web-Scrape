The  \npressing-stones are set, the fire is kindled.  \n20 Invincible in fight, saviour in battles, guard of our camp,  \nwinner of light and water,  \nBorn amid hymns, well-housed, exceeding famous, victor, in  \nthee may we rejoice, O Soma.  \n21 To him who worships Soma gives a milch cow, a fleet steed,  \nand a man of active knowledge,  \nSkilled in home duties, competent in council, meet for the  \ncourt, the glory of his father.  \n22 These herbs, these milch-kine, and these running waters, all  \nthese, O Soma, thou hast generated.  \nThe spacious firmament hast thou expanded, and with the  \nlight thou hast dispelled the darkness.  \n23 Do thou, God Soma, with thy God-like spirit, victorious,  \nwin for us a share of riches.  \nLet none prevent thee: thou art Lord of valour. Provide  \nfor these and those in fight for cattle.  \n24 The earth's eight points his brightness hath illumined, three  \ndesert regions, and the Seven Rivers.\n\np. 283\n\nGod Savitar the gold-eyed hath come hither, giving choice  \ntreasures to the man who worships.  \n25 Savitar, golden-handed, swiftly moving, goes on his way  \nbetween the earth and heaven,  \nDrives away sickness, bids the Sun approach us, and spreads  \nthe bright sky through the darksome region.  \n26 May, he, gold-handed Asura, kind leader, come hitherward  \nto us with help and favour.  \nDriving off Rakshasas and Yatudhanas, the God is present,  \npraised in hymns at evening.  \n27 O Savitar, thine ancient dustless pathways are well established  \nin the air's mid-region.  \nO God, come by those paths so fair to travel: preserve thou  \nus from harm this day and bless us.  \n28 Drink our libations, Asvins twain, grant us protection, both  \nof you,  \nWith aids which none may interrupt.  \n29 Make ye our speech effectual, O Asvins, and this our hymn,  \nye mighty Wonder-workers.  \nIn luckless game I call on you for succour: strengthen us  \nalso on the field of battle.  \n30 With undiminished blessings, O ye Asvins, through days and  \nnights on every side protect us.  \nThis prayer of ours may Varuna grant, and Mitra, and Aditi  \nand Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.  \n31 Throughout the dusky firmament, etc., as in XXXIII. 43.  \n32 Night! the terrestrial realm hath been filled with the  \nFather's power and might.  \nThou spreadest thee on high unto the seats of heaven: terrific  \ndarkness cometh nigh.\n\np. 284\n\n33 O Dawn enriched with ample wealth, bestow on us that  \nwondrous gift  \nWherewith we may support children and children's sons.  \n34 Agni at dawn, and Indra we invoke at dawn, and Varuna  \nand Mitra and the Asvins twain,  \nBhaga at dawn, Pushan and Brahmanaspati, Soma at dawn,  \nRudra may we invoke at dawn.  \n35 May we invoke strong early-conquering Bhaga, the Son of  \nAditi, the great Arranger,  \nThinking of whom the poor, yea, even the mighty, even the  \nKing says, Let me share in Bhaga.  \n36 Bhaga our guide, Bhaga whose gifts are faithful, favour this  \nprayer and give us wealth, O Bhaga.  \nBhaga, increase our store of kine and horses: Bhaga, may  \nwe be rich in men and heroes.  \n37 So may felicity be ours at present, and when the day  \napproaches, and at noontide;  \nAnd may we still, O Bounteous One, at sunset be happy in  \nthe Deities\xc2\x92 loving-kindness.  \n38 May Bhaga verily he Bliss-bestower, and through him,  \nGods! may happiness attend us.  \nAs such, O Bhaga, all with might invoke thee: as such be  \nthou our Champion here, O Bhaga.  \n39 To this our worship may the Dawns incline them, and come  \nto the pure place like Dadhikravan.  \nAs strong steeds draw a chariot shay they bring us hitherward  \nBhaga who discovers treasure.  \n40 May friendly Mornings dawn on us for ever, with wealth of  \nkine, of horses, and of heroes,  \nStreaming with all abundance, pouring fatness. Preserve  \nus evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.\n\np. 285\n\n41 Secure in thy protecting care, O Pushan, never may we fail:  \nWe here are singers of thy praise.  \n42 I praise with eloquence hire who guards all pathways. He,  \nwhen his love impelled him, went to Arka.  \nMay he vouchsafe us gear with gold to grace it: may Pushan  \nmake each prayer of ours effective.  \n43 Vishnu the undeceivable Protector strode three steps, thenceforth  \nEstablishing his high decrees.  \n44 This, Vishnu's station most sublime, the singers ever vigilant.  \nLovers of holy song, light up.  \n45 Filled full of fatness, compassing all things that be, wide,  \nspacious, dropping meath, beautiful in their form,  \nThe Heaven and the Earth by Varuna's decree, unwasting,  \nrich in seed, stand parted each from each.  \n46 Let those who are our foemen stand afar from us: with  \nIndra and with Agni we will drive them off.  \nVasus, \xc3\x82dityas, Rudras have exalted me, made me preeminent,  \nmighty, thinker, sovran lord.  \n47 Come, O Nasatyas, with the thrice eleven Gods: come,  \nO ye Asvins, to the drinking of the meath.  \nProlong our days of life, and wipe out all our sins: ward off  \nour enemies; be with us evermore.  \n48 May this your praise, may this your song, O Maruts, sung  \nby the poet, Mana's son, Mandarya,\n\np. 286\n\nBring offspring for ourselves with food to feed us. May we  \nfind strengthening food in full abundance.  \n49 They who were versed in ritual and metre, in hymns and  \nrules, were the Seven godlike Rishis.  \nViewing the path of those of old, the sages have taken up  \nthe reins like chariot-drivers.  \n50 Bestowing splendour, length of life, increase of wealth, and  \nconquering power,  \nThis brightly shining gold shall be attached to me for victory.  \n51 This gold no demons injure, no Pisachas; for this is might  \nof Gods, their primal offspring.  \nWhoever wears the gold of Daksha's children lives a long life  \namong the Gods, lives a long life among mankind.  \n52 This ornament of gold which Daksha's children bound, with  \nbenevolent thoughts, on Satanika,  \nI bind on me for life through hundred autumns, that I may  \nlive till ripe old age o\xc2\x92ertakes me.  \n53 Let Ahibudhnya also hear our calling, and Aja-Ekapad and  \nEarth and Ocean.\n\np. 287\n\nAll Gods Law-strengtheners, invoked and lauded, and Texts  \nrecited by the sages, help us!  \n54 These hymns that drop down fatness, with the ladle I ever  \noffer to the Kings \xc3\x82dityas.  \nMay Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga hear us, the mighty Varuna,  \nDaksha, and Amsa.  \n55 Seven Rishis are established in the body: seven guard it  \nevermore with care unceasing.  \nSeven waters seek the world of him who lies asleep: two  \nsleepless Gods are feast-fellows of him who wakes.  \n56 O Brahmanaspati, arise. God-fearing men, we pray to thee.  \nMay they who give good gifts, the Maruts, come to us. Indra,  \nbe thou most swift with them.  \n57 Now Brahmanaspati speaks forth aloud the solemn hymn  \nof praise.  \nWherein Indra and Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, the Gods have  \nmade their dwelling-place.  \n58 O Brahmanaspati, be thou controller of this our hymn, and  \nprosper thou our children.  \nAll that the Gods regard with love is blessed. Loud may  \nwe speak, with brave sons, in assembly.  \nHe who sate down. Mighty in mind. Father who made us.  \nA share of good, O Lord of Food.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Book XXXV](wyvbk35.htm)\n\n"
