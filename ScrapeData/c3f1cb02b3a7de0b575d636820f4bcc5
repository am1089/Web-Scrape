We, thy friends [1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:1:1), have chosen thee for our\nprotection, (we) the mortals (thee) the god, the offspring of the Waters, the\nblessed one with fine splendour [2](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:1:2), who gloriously\nadvances, the unmenaced one.\n\n2\\. When thou, finding pleasure in the wood, hast gone to thy mothers, the\nWaters, that return of thine, Agni, (to this world) should not be slighted,\nwhen dwelling afar thou hast come hither.\n\n3\\. High above (all) pungent sharpness thou hast grown up\n[1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:3:1), and verily thou art kind-hearted. Some go\nforward here and there; others sit around thee, in whose friendship thou\nabidest [2](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:3:2).\n\n4\\. He who has passed beyond (all) failures, beyond all hindrances\n[1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:4:1), the guileless, watchful ones\n[2](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:4:2) have found him as a lion (is found), when he had\ngone into the Waters;\n\n5\\. He who had run as it were by his own might, Agni, who thus dwelt in\nconcealment--Him Matari _s_ van brought hither from afar, from the gods, when\nhe had been produced by attrition (of the woods).\n\n6\\. (And thus) the mortals have taken thee up, O carrier of sacrificial food\ntowards the gods [1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:6:1), because thou, O (god) belonging\nto Manus, protectest all sacrifices by the power of thy mind, O youngest one!\n\n7 [1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:7:1). This is something glorious; herein thy\nwonderful power shows itself even to the simple, that the cattle lie down\nround about thee when\n\np. 257\n\nthou hast been kindled, O Agni, at the approach of darkness\n[2](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:7:2).\n\n8\\. Make your offerings in (Agni), the best performer of worship, the sharp\none who purifies with his flames [1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:8:1). Serve ye,\nobediently the god, the quick messenger, the agile, the old, the adorable.\n\n9 [1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:9:1). Three hundred and three thousand gods and\nthirty and nine did service to Agni. They sprinkled him with ghee and spread\nout for him the sacrificial grass: then they made him sit down as a Hot _ri_.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi.
