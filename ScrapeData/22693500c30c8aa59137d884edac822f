(The agni built of mind, &c.) is a particular form of the preceding one\n(i.e. the agni built of bricks), on account of the leading subject-matter; it\nis (part of) the act; as in the case of the manasa cup.\n\nYour supposition, the purvapakshin objects, as to those fire-altars being not\nsupplementary to the sacrificial act,\n\np. 261\n\nbut altogether independent of it, is untenable. The influence of the leading\nsubject-matter rather compels us to conclude that the instruction given by the\ntext about the agni made of mind and so on, enjoins some particular mode of\nthe same agni which the preceding sections describe as the outcome of a real\nact 1.--But are not indicatory marks stronger than the leading subject-matter?\n--True in general; but indicatory marks such as those contained in the\npassages quoted above are by no means stronger than the general subject-\nmatter. For as those passages are of the nature of glorifications of the\nfanciful fire-altars, the li\xe1\xb9\x85gas (have no proving power in themselves but)\nmerely illustrate some other matter (viz. the injunction to which those\npassages are arthavadas); and as they are of that nature they may, there being\nno other proof, be taken as mere gu _n_ avadas, and as such are not able to\nsublate the influence of the prakara _n_ a. On the ground of the latter,\ntherefore, all those fanciful agnis must be viewed as forming parts of the\nsacrificial action.\n\nThe case is analogous to that of the 'mental' (cup). On the tenth day of the\nSoma sacrifices occupying twelve days--which day is termed avivakya--a soma\ncup is offered mentally, the earth being viewed as the cup, the sea as the\nSoma and Pra _g_ apati as the divinity to which the offering is made. All\nrites connected with that cup, viz. taking it up, putting it down in its\nplace, offering the liquid in it, taking up the remaining liquid, the priests\ninviting one another to drink the remainder, and the drinking, all these rites\nthe text declares to be mental only, i.e. to be done in thought only 2. Yet\nthis mental quasi-cup, as standing under the heading of a sacrificial act,\nforms part of that act.--The same then holds good with regard to the quasi-\nagnis made of mind and so on.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[261:1](sbe38188.htm#fr_166) I.e. of the agni made of bricks which is the\noutcome of the agni _k_ ayana.--\xc3\x82n.
