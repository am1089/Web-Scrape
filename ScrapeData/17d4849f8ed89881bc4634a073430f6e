Explain (it) yourself, O Vidura! if there is any remnant\nof intelligence (left) in you.\n\np. 150\n\nVidura said:\n\n1 am born of a _S_ udra womb, and do not like to say more than what (I have\nsaid). But the intelligence of that youth, I believe to be eternal 1. He who\nhas come of a Brahma _n_ a womb, even though he may proclaim a great mystery,\ndoes not thereby become liable to the censure of the gods. Therefore do I say\nthis to you.\n\nDh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra said:\n\nDo you, O Vidura! speak to the ancient Sanatana for me, so that there may be a\nmeeting even here, between (myself in) this body (and him).\n\nVai _s_ ampayana 2 said:\n\n(Then) Vidura meditated on that sage whose vows are laudable 3. And he, too, O\ndescendant of Bharata! knowing of such meditation, made his appearance. And he\n4, too, received him with the ceremonies prescribed in the ordinances. After\nhe had been comfortably seated, and had taken rest, Vidura then spoke to him:\n'Venerable sir! there is some doubt in Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra's mind, which\ncannot\n\np. 151\n\nbe explained by me. Do you be pleased to explain (it) to him. Hearing it\n(explained), this lord of men may cross beyond all misery, so that gain and\nloss [1](sbe0823.htm#fn_611), (what is) agreeable and (what is) odious, old\nage and death, fear and vindictiveness, hunger and thirst, frenzy and worldly\ngreatness, disgust and also laziness, desire and wrath, ruin and prosperity,\nmay not trouble him.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[149:1](sbe0822.htm#fr_608) So Nilaka _nth_ a. _S_ a _n_ kara says Sanatsu _g_\nata is Sanatkumara, and the component parts of the name he paraphrases by\n'born from Brahman.' For Sanatana, see B _ri_ hadara _ny_ aka, p. 506, and\nnote  [1](sbe0821.htm#fn_593), [p. 141](sbe0821.htm#page_141) supra.\n\n[149:2](sbe0822.htm#fr_609) I. e. relating to subjects which may be freely\ndiscussed by all, and those which may not. Nilaka _nth_ a adopts a different\nreading, which he interprets to mean 'doctrines exoteric and esoteric,' e. g.\nself-restraint, &c., and the acquisition of mystic power, &c., respectively.\nThe expression 'doubts of the mind' occurs. however, further on.\n\n[150:1](sbe0822.htm#fr_610) I. e., I suppose, never-failing, and such as can\ndeal with all sorts of topics. Sanatkumara, it need scarcely be stated, is the\nteacher of Narada in the famous dialogue in the _Kh_ andogyopanishad, p. 473.\n\n[150:2](sbe0822.htm#fr_611) Vai _s_ ampayana is the narrator of the grand\nstory of which pieces like the present form parts.\n\n[150:3](sbe0822.htm#fr_612) The reading is sometimes different, so as to mean\n'of rigid vows,' as at Gita, [p. 61](sbe0806.htm#page_61) supra.\n\n[150:4](sbe0822.htm#fr_613) The pronouns here are too numerous. Does 'he' here\nrefer to Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra? Vidura seems more likely, though the express\nmention of him in the next sentence might be treated as pointing the other\nway.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter II](sbe0823.htm)\n\n"
