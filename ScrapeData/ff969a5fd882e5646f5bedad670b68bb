FIRST BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n5:1:1:11\\. Once upon a time the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from\nPra _g_ apati, strove together. And the Asuras, even through arrogance,\nthinking, 'Unto whom, forsooth, should we make offering?' went on offering\ninto their own mouths. They came to naught, even through arrogance: wherefore\nlet no one be arrogant, for verily arrogance is the cause 1 of ruin.\n\n5:1:1:22\\. But the gods went on making offerings unto one another. Pra _g_\napati gave himself up to them: thus the sacrifice 2 became theirs; and indeed\nthe sacrifice is the food of the gods 3.\n\n5:1:1:33\\. They then spake, 'To which of us shall this 4 belong?' They did not\nagree together, saying,\n\np. 2\n\n[paragraph continues] 'To me! to me!' Not being agreed, they said, 'Let us run\na race for it: whichever of us shall win, to him it shall belong!'--'So be\nit!' so they ran a race for it.\n\n5:1:1:44\\. Then B _ri_ haspati hasted up to Savit _ri_ for his impulsion 1,--\nSavit _ri_ being the impeller (prasavit _ri_ ) among the gods--saying, 'Impel\nthis for me, (so that) impelled by thee, I may win this!' Then Savit _ri_ , as\nthe impeller, impelled it for him, and impelled by Savit _ri_ , he won: he\nbecame everything here, he won everything here; for he won Pra _g_ apati, and\nPra _g_ apati (the lord of creatures and procreation) indeed is everything\nhere. By offering therewith he (B _ri_ haspati) ascended to that upper region.\nTherefore who so knoweth, and who so knoweth not,--they say, 'That upper\nregion belongeth to B _ri_ haspati.'\n\n5:1:1:55\\. Thus they who of old used to offer the Va _g_ apeya, ascended to\nthat upper region. From there Aupavi _G_ ana _s_ ruteya descended again:\nthenceforward (all men) descend again.\n\np. 3\n\n5:1:1:66\\. Indra offered that (Va _g_ apeya),--he became everything here, he\nwon everything here; for he won Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati  is\neverything here: by offering therewith he ascended to that upper region.\n\n5:1:1:77\\. Thus they who of old used to offer the Va _g_ apeya, ascended to\nthat upper region. From there Aupavi _G_ ana _s_ ruteya descended' again:\nthenceforward (all men) descend again.\n\n5:1:1:88\\. And whosoever offers the Va _g_ apeya, he becomes everything here,\nhe wins everything here; for he wins Pra _g_ apati, and Pra _g_ apati indeed\nis everything here.\n\n5:1:1:99\\. Here now they say, 'One must not offer the Va _g_ apeya; for he who\noffers the Va _g_ apeya wins everything here,--for he wins Pra _g_ apati, and\nPra _g_ apati is everything here,--he leaves nothing remaining here: his\npeople (or offspring) is like to become worse (off).'\n\n5:1:1:1010\\. Let him none the less sacrifice: whatever (priests) thus know\nthat sacrifice properly, in respect of the Ri _k_ , the Ya _g_ us, and the\nSaman, and such as are proficient, let them assist him in offering it; for\nverily this is the perfection of that sacrifice, when wise (priests) assist\nhim in offering it: let him therefore sacrifice by all means.\n\n5:1:1:1111\\. Now truly this (the Va _g_ apeya) is the Brahma _n_ a's own\nsacrifice, inasmuch as B _ri_ haspati (the lord of prayer and devotion)\nperformed it; for B _ri_ haspati is the Brahman (priesthood, or priestly\ndignity), and the Brahma _n_ a is the Brahman. And it is also that of the Ra\n_g_ anya, inasmuch as Indri performed it; for Indra is the Kshatra (nobility,\nor ruling power), and the Ra _g_ anya is the Kshatra.\n\np. 4\n\n5:1:1:1212\\. To the king (ra _g_ an) doubtless belongs the Ra _g_ asuya; for\nby offering the Ra _g_ asuya he becomes king; and unsuited for kingship is the\nBrahma _n_ a. And, moreover, the Ra _g_ asuya is the lower, and the Va _g_\napeya the higher (sacrifice).\n\n5:1:1:1313\\. For by offering the Ra _g_ asuya 1 he becomes king, and by the Va\n_g_ apeya (he becomes) emperor (samra _g_ ); and the office of king is the\nlower, and that of emperor the higher: a king might indeed wish to become\nemperor, for the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher;\nbut the emperor would not wish to become king, for the office of king is the\nlower, and that of emperor the higher.\n\n5:1:1:1414\\. Thus that (king) who, by performing the Va _g_ apeya, becomes\nemperor, possesses himself of everything here. Previously to each performance\n(of an ish _t_ i 2) he offers that oblation to Savit _ri_ (the sun), with the\ntext, 'O divine Savit _ri_ , impel (prosper) the sacrifice, impel Pra _g_\napati for his portion!'\n\np. 5\n\n5:1:1:1515\\. And even as then B _ri_ haspati hasted up to Savit _ri_ for his\nimpulsion Savit _ri_ being the impeller among the gods--saying, 'Impel this\nfor me, (so that) impelled by thee I may win it!' and Savit _ri_ , as the\nimpeller, impelled it for him; and impelled by Savit _ri_ he won it; even so\ndoes this (sacrificing king) now haste up to Savit _ri_ for his impulsion--\nSavit _ri_ being the impeller among the gods--saying, 'Impel this for me: may\nI win it, impelled by thee!' and Savit _ri_ , as the impeller, impels it for\nhim, and he wins it impelled by Savit _ri_.\n\n5:1:1:1616\\. Wherefore he says (Va _g_. S. IX, 1), 'God Savit _ri_ , speed the\nsacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice unto his portion! May the heavenly.\nthought-cleansing Gandharva cleanse our thought! May the Lord of Speech render\nour meat palatable, hail!' For the Lord of Speech is Pra _g_ apati, and meat\nmeans food: 'May Pra _g_ apati this day make palatable this our food!' thus he\nthereby says. This same oblation he offers till the day before the Soma-feast,\nfor thus that performance of his has been commenced; and he (Savit _ri_ , the\nSun) becomes serene during that sacrifice.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[1:1](sbe4103.htm#fr_28) Lit. 'the mouth,' i.e. the opening or beginning, of\nruin. The St. Petersburg Dict. compares Prov. xvi. 18: 'Pride goeth before\ndestruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.'\n\n[1:2](sbe4103.htm#fr_29) Pra _g_ apati (the lord of creatures or generation)\nis both the sacrifice and the year (time); see III, 2, 2, 4.\n\n[1:3](sbe4103.htm#fr_30) See II, 4, 2, 1. To them (the gods) he (Pra _g_\napati) said, 'The sacrifice (shall be) your food, immortality your sustenance\n(ur _g_ ), and the sun your light!'\n\n[1:4](sbe4103.htm#fr_31) For the neuter idam--hardly here 'this universe,' or\n'va _g_ apeyam,' p. 2 but rather 'this thing, it'--the Ka _n_ va text reads\nayam 'he,' i.e. Pra _g_ apati, or the sacrifice (ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, masc.); cf.\nnote on [V, 1, 4, 15](sbe4106.htm#5:1:4:15).\n\n[2:1](sbe4103.htm#fr_32) For want of a simpler and more homely set of terms\nfor the derivatives of the verb su 'to animate' here used, those used in the\npreceding volumes are here generally adhered to, though, as there, somewhat\nreluctantly. The simple 'to bless, blessing, &c.' might sometimes fit quite\nwell, though no doubt they imply an idea altogether foreign to the\netymological meaning of this verb, and could not possibly be used, as is the\ncase here, of the animating influence of the sun. Sometimes 'to speed' has\nbeen chosen, where the etymological connection with Savit _ri_ is not insisted\nupon; while in other passages 'to consecrate, consecration, &c.' might\nprobably come nearer to the meaning of the original. Cp. Delbruck, Altindische\nSyntax, p. 256.\n\n[4:1](sbe4103.htm#fr_33) Katy. _S_ r. XV, I, 1-2, lays down the rule that the\nRa _g_ asuya is to be performed by a king who has not yet performed the Va _g_\napeya. \xc3\x82 _s_ val. _S_ r. IX, 9, 19, on the other hand, rules: 'After\nperforming it (the Va _g_ apeya) let a king perform the Ra _g_ asuya, a Brahma\n_n_ a the B _ri_ haspati-sava' (cf. V, 2, 1, 19). See also Katy. XIV, 1, 2\nseq. Cf. La _t_ y. _S_ r. VIII, 11, 1 seq.\n\n[4:2](sbe4103.htm#fr_34) During the bright fortnights (of the waxing moon)\npreceding and following the Va _g_ apeya ceremony proper, the sacrificer has\nto perform a number of so-called pariya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a ('surrounding or enclosing\nsacrifices') consisting of one-day Soma-sacrifices of different kinds, each of\nwhich is preceded by a special diksha, or initiation ceremony (cf. III, 1, 2,\n1 seq.; La _t_ y. _S_ r. VIII, 11, 2). It is to the ish _t_ is (diksha _n_\niyesh _t_ i, praya _n_ iyesh _t_ i) of these pariya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as that the above\ninjunction regarding the performance of the Savitri ahuti refers.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 1, 2.
