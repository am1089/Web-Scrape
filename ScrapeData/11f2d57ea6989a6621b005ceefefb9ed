On account of the reference to ceremonial purifications (in the case of\nthe higher castes) and on account of their absence being declared (in the case\nof the _S_ udras).\n\nThat the _S_ udras are not qualified, follows from that circumstance also that\nin different places of the vidyas such ceremonies as the upanayana and the\nlike are referred to. Compare, for instance, _S_ at. Br. XI, 5, 3, 13, 'He\ninitiated him as a pupil;' _Kh_. Up. VII, 1, 1, 'Teach me, Sir! thus he\napproached him;' Pra. Up. I, 1, 'Devoted to Brahman, firm in Brahman, seeking\nfor the highest Brahman they, carrying fuel in their hands, approached the\nvenerable Pippalada, thinking that he would teach them all that.'--Thus the\nfollowing passage also, 'He without having made them undergo the upanayana\n(said) to them' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 11, 7), shows that the upanayana is a well-\nestablished ceremony 1.--With reference to the _S_ udras, on the other hand,\nthe absence of ceremonies is frequently mentioned; so, for instance, Manu X,\n4, where they are spoken of as 'once born' only ('the _S_ udra is the fourth\ncaste, once-born'), and Manu X, 126, 'In the _S_ udra there is not any sin,\nand he is not fit for any ceremony.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[227:1](sbe34105.htm#fr_229) The king A _s_ vapati receives some Brahma _n_ as\nas his pupils without insisting on the upanayana. This express statement of\nthe upanayana having been omitted in a certain case shows it to be the general\nrule.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 37](sbe34106.htm)\n\n"
