XXII, 19 3,] 'Plenteous by the mother, strengthful by the\nfather,'--its mother, doubtless, is this (earth), and its father yonder (sky):\nit is to these two he commits it;--'a horse thou art, a steed thou art,'--he\nthereby instructs it, whence clever subjects (or children) are born to\nhim;--'a courser (atya) thou art, a charger thou art,'--he therewith leads it\nbeyond (ati), whence the horse goes beyond (surpasses) other animals, and\nwhence the horse attains to pre-eminence among animals;--'a runner thou art, a\nracer thou art, a prize-winner thou\n\np. 288\n\nart,'--in accordance with the text is (the meaning of) this;--'a male thou\nart, well-disposed towards man thou art,'--this is with a view to its (or,\nhis) being supplied with a mate;--'Speedy thou art called, Child thou art\ncalled,'--this is the horse's favourite name: by its favourite name he thus\naddresses it; whence even if two enemies 1, on meeting together, address one\nanother by name, they get on amicably together.\n\n13:1:6:22\\. 'Go thou along the way of the \xc3\x82dityas!'--to the \xc3\x82dityas he thus\nmakes it go.--'Ye divine guardians of the quarters, protect this horse,\nsprinkled for sacrifice to the gods!'--the guardians of the quarters are a\nhundred princes born in wedlock: to them he commits it;--'here is joy: here\nlet it rejoice!--here is safe keeping, here is its own safe keeping, hail!'\nFor a year he offers the (four Dh _ri_ ti) oblations 2\\--(amounting to)\nsixteen nineties, for they are the horse's chain 3, and it is therewith alone\nthat he chains it; whence the horse when let loose returns to its chain: (they\namount to) sixteen nineties 4; for these (oblations of safe keeping) are the\nhorse's chain, and it is therewith alone that he chains it, whence the horse,\nwhen let loose, does not (entirely) abandon its chain.\n\n13:1:6:33\\. Verily, the A _s_ vamedha means royal sway: it is after royal sway\nthat these strive who guard the horse. Those of them who reach the end become\n\np. 289\n\n[paragraph continues] (sharers in) the royal sway, but those who do not reach\nthe end are cut off from royal sway. Wherefore let him who holds royal sway\nperform the horse-sacrifice; for, verily, whosoever performs the horse-\nsacrifice, without possessing power, is poured (swept) away.--Now, were\nunfriendly, men to get hold of the horse, his sacrifice would be cut in twain,\nand he would become the poorer for it. A hundred men clad in armour guard it\nfor the continuity and uninterrupted performance of the sacrifice; and he will\nnot become the poorer for it; (but if it be lost) they should fetch another\n(horse), and sprinkle it: this is the expiation in that case.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[287:2](sbe44078.htm#fr_724) The author apparently takes 'ish _t_ apurta' in\nthe sense of either 'sacrifice and fulfilment,' or 'the fulfilment of (the\nobjects of) sacrifice.' Cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 319; X, p. 96.\n\n[287:3](sbe44079.htm#fr_725) See [XIII, 4, 2, 15](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:15).\n\n[288:1](sbe44079.htm#fr_726) Harisvamin, perhaps rightly, takes 'amitrau' in\nthe sense of 'amitrayo _h_ putrau,' 'the sons of two enemies.'\n\n[288:2](sbe44079.htm#fr_727) See note on [XIII, 4, 3,\n5](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:5).\n\n[288:3](sbe44079.htm#fr_728) Or, place of confinement,\nstable,--'bandhanasthanam.'
