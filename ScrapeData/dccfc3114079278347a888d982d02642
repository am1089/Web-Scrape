That system allows of great freedom in\nits application to different languages, and has, therefore, recommended itself\nto many scholars, even if they had long been accustomed to use their own\nsystem of transliteration.\n\nIt rests in fact on a few principles only, which may be applied to individual\nlanguages according to the views which each student has formed for himself of\nthe character and the pronunciation of the vowels and consonants of any given\nalphabet.\n\nIt does not differ essentially from the Standard Alphabet proposed by\nProfessor Lepsius. It only endeavours to realise, by means of the ordinary\ntypes which are found in every printing office, what my learned friend has\nbeen enabled to achieve, it may be in a more perfect manner, by means of a\nnumber of new types with diacritical marks, cast expressly for him by the\nBerlin Academy.\n\nThe general principles of what, on account of its easy application to all\nlanguages, I have called the Missionary Alphabet, are these:\n\n1\\. No letters are to be used which do not exist in ordinary founts.\n\np. xlix\n\n2\\. The same Roman type is always to represent the same foreign letter, and\nthe same foreign letter is always to be represented by the same Roman type.\n\n3\\. Simple letters are, as a rule, to be represented by simple, compound by\ncompound types.\n\n4\\. It is not attempted to indicate the pronunciation of foreign languages,\nbut only to represent foreign letters by Roman types, leaving the\npronunciation to be learnt, as it is now, from grammars or from conversation\nwith natives.\n\n5\\. The foundation of every system of transliteration must consist of a\nclassification of the typical sounds of human speech. Such classification may\nbe more or less perfect, more or less minute, according to the objects in\nview. For ordinary purposes the classification in vowels and consonants, and\nof consonants again in gutturals, dentals, and labials suffices. In these\nthree classes we distinguish hard (not-voiced) and sonant (voiced) consonants,\neach being liable to aspiration; nasals, sibilants, and semivowels, some of\nthese also, being either voiced or not-voiced.\n\n6\\. After having settled the typical sounds, we assign to them, as much as\npossible, the ordinary Roman types of the first class.\n\n7\\. We then arrange in every language which possesses a richer alphabet, all\nremaining letters, according to their affinities, as modifications of the\nnearest typical letters, or as letters of the second and third class. Thus\nlinguals in Sanskrit are treated as nearest to dentals, palatals to gutturals.\n\n8\\. The manner of expressing such modifications is uniform throughout. While\nall typical letters of\n\np. l\n\nthe first class are expressed by Roman types, modified letters of the second\nclass are expressed by italics, modified letters of the third class by small\ncapitals. Only in extreme cases, where another class of modified types is\nwanted, are we compelled to have recourse either to diacritical marks, or to a\ndifferent fount of types.\n\n9\\. Which letters in each language are to be considered as primary, secondary,\nor tertiary may, to a certain extent, be left to the discretion of individual\nscholars.\n\n10\\. As it has been found quite impossible to devise any practical alphabet\nthat should accurately represent the pronunciation of words, the Missionary\nAlphabet, by not attempting to indicate minute shades of pronunciation, has at\nall events the advantage of not misleading readers in their pronunciation of\nforeign words. An italic _t_ , for instance, or a small capital T, serves\nsimply as a warning that this is not the ordinary t, though it has some\naffinity with it. How it is to be pronounced must be learnt for each language,\nas it now is, from a grammar or otherwise. Thus _t_ in Sanskrit is the lingual\n_t_. How that is to be pronounced, we must learn from the Pratisakhvas, or\nfrom the mouth of a highly educated _S_ rotriya. We shall then learn that its\npronunciation is really that of what we call the ordinary dental t, as in\ntown, while the ordinary dental t in Sanskrit has a pronunciation of its own,\nextremely difficult to acquire for Europeans.\n\n11\\. Words or sentences which used to be printed in italics are spaced.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Transliteration Chart, Page 1](sbe01005.htm)\n\n'
