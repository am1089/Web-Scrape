The translation is according to the\nViramitrodaya. The subject of bets on animals is treated at great length in\nthe Dhammathats of Burma, which are based on the law-codes of India.

That portion which has to be paid to the\nking (see paragraph 8) may also be held to be included in this rule, as B _ri_\nhaspati says: 'Let the master of the gaming-house collect the stakes and pay\nhis due to the winning party and to the king.' \xc3\x82pastamba II, 10, 25, 12, 13;\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 199, 200.\n\n[213:3](sbe3348.htm#fr_641) The rendering of the first portion of this\nparagraph is conjectural.
