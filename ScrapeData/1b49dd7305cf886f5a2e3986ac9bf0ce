Now, Indrota Daivapa _S_ aunaka once performed this sacrifice for\n_G_ aname _g_ aya Parikshita, and by performing it he extinguished all evil-\ndoing, all Brahman-slaughter; and, verily, he who performs the A _s_ vamedha\nextinguishes (the guilt incurred by) all evil-doing, all Brahman-slaughter.\n\n13:5:4:22\\. It is of this, indeed, that the Gatha (strophe) sings,--'In\n\xc3\x82sandivat 1, _G_ aname _g_ aya bound for the gods a black-spotted, grain-\neating horse, adorned with a golden ornament and with yellow garlands.'\n\n13:5:4:33\\. [There are] those same first two days 2, and a _G_ yotis 3\nAtiratra: therewith (they sacrificed) for Bhimasena;--those same first two\ndays, and a Go Atiratra: therewith (they sacrificed) for Ugrasena;--those same\nfirst two days, and an \xc3\x82yus Atiratra: therewith (they sacrificed) for _S_\nrutasena. These are the Parikshitiyas 4, and it is of this that the Gatha\nsings,--'The righteous Parikshitas, performing horse-sacrifices, by their\nrighteous work did away with sinful work one after another.'\n\np. 397\n\n13:5:4:44\\. Those same first two days, and an Abhi _g_ it 1 Atiratra,--\ntherewith Para \xc3\x82 _t_ nara, the Kausalya king, once sacrificed: it is of this\nthat Gatha sings,--'A _t_ nara's son, the Kausalya Para, Haira _n_ yanabha,\ncaused a horse, meet for sacrifice, to be bound, and gave away the replete\nregions.'\n\n13:5:4:55\\. Those same first two days, and a Vi _s_ va _g_ it 1 Atiratra,--\ntherewith Purukutsa, the Aikshvaka king, once on a time performed a horse\n(daurgaha)-sacrifice, whence it is of this that the _Ri_ shi sings ( _Ri_ g-v.\nIV, 42, 8),--'These, the seven _Ri_ shis, were then our fathers when Daurgaha\n2 was bound.'\n\n13:5:4:66\\. Those same first two days, and a Mahavrata 3 Atiratra,--therewith\nMarutta \xc3\x82vikshita, the \xc3\x82yogava king, once performed sacrifice; whence the\nMaruts became his guards-men, Agni his chamberlain, and the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_\nhis counsellors: it is of this that the Gatha sings,--'The Maruts dwelt as\nguards-men in Marutta \xc3\x82vikshita's house, Agni as his chamberlain, and the Vi\n_s_ ve Deva _h_ as his counsellors.' And, verily, the Maruts become the\nguards-men, Agni the chamberlain, and the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ the counsellors\nof him who performs the horse-sacrifice.\n\n13:5:4:77\\. Those same first two days, and an Aptoryama 4 Atiratra,--it was\ntherewith that Kraivya, the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala king, once performed sacrifice,--\nfor Krivis they formerly called the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas: it is of this that the\nGatha sings,--'At Parivakra, the\n\np. 398\n\n[paragraph continues] Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala overlord of the Krivis seized a horse,\nmeet for sacrifice, with offering-gifts of a hundred thousand (head of\ncattle).'\n\n13:5:4:88\\. And a second (Gatha),--'A thousand myriads there were, and five-\nand-twenty hundreds, which the Brahma _n_ as of the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ alas from every\nquarter divided between them.'\n\n13:5:4:99\\. The Agnish _t_ oma in the Triv _ri_ t (stoma); the Ukthya in the\nPa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a; and the third day, with the Uktha (stotras), in the\nSaptada _s_ a; the Sho _d_ a _s_ in (stotra) in the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a, the night\n(stotras) in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a, and the Sandhi (stotra) in the Triv\n_ri_ t,--this is the (sacrifice) resulting in the Anush _t_ ubh 1: it is\ntherewith that sacrifice was performed by Dhvasan Dvaitavana, the king of the\nMatsyas, where there is the lake Dvaitavana; and it is of this that the Gatha\nsings,--'Fourteen steeds did king Dvaitavana, victorious in battle, bind for\nIndra V _ri_ trahan, whence the lake Dvaitavana (took its name).'\n\n13:5:4:1010\\. The (three) Pavamana (stotras) in the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a\n(stoma), and (those performed) by repetitions 2 in the Triv _ri_ t; the\nPavamanas in the Katu _s_ _k_ atvari _m_ _s_ a (44-versed stoma), and (those\nperformed) by repetition 3 in the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a; the Pavamanas in\n\np. 399\n\nthe Ash _t_ a _k_ atvari _m_ _s_ a (48), and (those performed) by repetition\nin the Trayastri _m_ _s_ a (33) up to the Agnish _t_ oma-saman, the Uktha\n(stotras) in the Dvatri _m_ _s_ a (32), the Sho _d_ a _s_ in in the Ekavi _m_\n_s_ a, the night (stotras) in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a, and the Sandhi\n(stotra) in the Triv _ri_ t\n\n13:5:4:1111\\. Suchlike is Vish _n_ u's striding 1,--it was therewith that\nBharata Dau _h_ shanti once performed sacrifice, and attained that wide sway\nwhich now belongs to the Bharatas: it is of this that the Gatha\nsings,--'Seventy-eight steeds did Bharata Dau _h_ shanti bind for the V _ri_\ntra-slayer on the Yamuna, and fifty-five near the Ga\xe1\xb9\x85ga.'\n\n13:5:4:1212\\. And a second (Gatha),--'Having bound a hundred and thirty-three\nhorses, meet for sacrifice, king Saudyumni, more shifty, overcame the other\nshiftless ones.'\n\n13:5:4:1313\\. And a third,--'At Na _d_ apit 2, the Apsaras _S_ akuntala\nconceived Bharata, who, after conquering the whole earth, brought to Indra\nmore than a thousand horses, meet for sacrifice.'\n\n13:5:4:1414\\. And a fourth 3,--'The greatness of Bharata neither the men\nbefore nor those after him attained, nor did the five (tribes of) men, even as\na mortal man (does not touch) the sky with his arms.'\n\n13:5:4:1515\\. With the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a-stoma 4 Rishabha Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ atura,\n\np. 400\n\nking of the _S_ viknas, performed sacrifice: it is of this that the Gatha\nsings,--'When Rishabha Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ atura was sacrificing, the Brahman-folk,\nhaving received wealth at the A _s_ vamedha, divided the offering-gifts\nbetween them.'\n\n13:5:4:1616\\. With the Trayastri _m_ _s_ a-stoma _S_ o _n_ a Satrasaha, the Pa\n_\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala king, performed sacrifice: it is of this that the Gatha\nsings,--'When Satrasaha performs the horse-sacrifice, the Trayastri _m_ _s_ a\n(stomas) come forth as (Taurva _s_ a) horses, and six thousand mail-clad men\n1.'\n\n13:5:4:1717\\. And a second (Gatha),--'At the sacrifice of thee, Koka's father,\nthe Trayastri _m_ _s_ a (stomas) come forth, each as six times six thousand 2\n(horses), and six thousand mail-clad men.'\n\n13:5:4:1818\\. And a third,--'When Satrasaha, the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ala king, was\nsacrificing, wearing beautiful garlands, Indra revelled in Soma, and the\nBrahma _n_ as became satiated with wealth.'\n\n13:5:4:1919\\. _S_ atanika Satra _g_ ita performed the Govinata (form of A _s_\nvamedha), after taking away the\n\np. 401\n\nhorse of the Ka _s_ ya (king); and since that time the Ka _s_ is do not keep\nup the (sacrificial) fires, saying, 'The Soma-drink has been taken from us.'\n\n13:5:4:2020\\. The mode (of chanting) for this (Govinata form) is:--the\nPavamana (stotras) in the _K_ aturvi _m_ _s_ a (stoma), and (those chanted) by\nrepetitions in the Triv _ri_ t;--the Pavamanas in the _K_ atu _s_ _k_ atvari\n_m_ _s_ a, the \xc3\x82 _g_ ya (stotras) in the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a, the Ukthas 1 In the\nTri _n_ ava, the P _ri_ sh _th_ as in the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a;--the Pavamanas in\nthe Sha _t_ tri _m_ _s_ a (36-versed), and (those chanted) by repetitions in\nthe Trayastri _m_ _s_ a (33) up to the Agnish _t_ oma-saman, the Ukthas in the\nEkavi _m_ _s_ a, the Sho _d_ a _s_ in in the Ekavi _m_ _s_ a, the night\n(stotras) in the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ada _s_ a, and the Sandhi (stotra) in the Triv\n_ri_ t.\n\n13:5:4:2121\\. It is of this that the Gatha sings,--' _S_ atanika Satra _g_ ita\nseized a sacrificial horse, in the neighbourhood, the sacrifice of the Ka _s_\nis, even as Bharata (seized that) of the Satvats.'\n\n13:5:4:2222\\. And a second,--'The mighty _S_ atanika, having seized, in the\nneighbourhood, Dh _ri_ tarash _t_ ra's white sacrificial horse, roaming at\nwill in its tenth month, _S_ atanika 2 performed the Govinata-sacrifice.'\n\n13:5:4:2323\\. And a fourth 3,--'The greatness of the Bharatas neither the men\nbefore nor those after them attained, nor did the seven (tribes of) men, even\nas a mortal man (does not touch) the sky with his flanks.'\n\np. 402\n\n13:5:4:2424\\. Now as to the sacrificial gifts. Whatever there is towards the\nmiddle of the kingdom other than the land, the men, and the property of the\nBrahma _n_ a, of that the eastern region belongs to the Hot _ri_ , the\nsouthern to the Brahman, the western to the Adhvaryu, the northern to the\nUdgat _ri_ ; and the Hot _ri_ kas share this along with them.\n\n13:5:4:2525\\. When the Udayaniya (completing offering) is finished, he seizes\ntwenty-one barren cows, sacred to Mitra-Varu _n_ a, the Vi _s_ ve Deva _h_ ,\nand B _ri_ haspati, with the view of his gaining those deities. And the reason\nwhy those sacred to B _ri_ haspati come last is that B _ri_ haspati is the\nBrahman (n.), and he thus establishes himself finally in the Brahman.\n\n13:5:4:2626\\. And as to their being twenty-one of them,--the twenty-one-fold\nis he who shines yonder: twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and\nyonder sun as the twenty-first--this consummation (he thereby obtains).\n\n13:5:4:2727\\. When the Udavasaniya (closing offering) is completed, they give,\nfor a sacrificial gift, four women, with a maiden as the fifth, and four\nhundred female attendants according to agreement.\n\n13:5:4:2828\\. And during the following year he performs the animal sacrifices\nof the seasons,--six (victims) sacred to Agni in the spring, six to Indra in\nthe summer, six to Par _g_ anya, or to the Maruts, in the rainy season, six to\nMitra and Varu _n_ a in the autumn, six to Indra and Vish _n_ u in the winter,\nand six to Indra and B _ri_ haspati in the dewy season,--six seasons are a\nyear: in the seasons, in the year, he thus establishes himself. These amount\nto thirty-six animals,--the B _ri_ hati (metre) consists of thirty-six\nsyllables, and the heavenly world is established\n\np. 403\n\nupon the B _ri_ hati: and thus he finally establishes himself, by means of the\nB _ri_ hati metre, in the heavenly world.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[396:1](sbe44109.htm#fr_1034) Lit., (in the city, nagare, Harisvamin)\npossessed of a throne.

The St. Petersb. Dict., on the other hand, construes 'trayastri _m_\n_s_ a _h_ ' along with 'sha _t_ sahasra _n_ i' = 6033 (? horses of mail-clad\nmen). This interpretation seems to me to involve serious difficulties. The use\nof those Stomas doubtless is supposed to result in the advantages here\nenumerated.\n\n[400:2](sbe44109.htm#fr_1051) Koko nama natha _h_ , ke te a _s_ va udirata iti\nprathamaya _m_ gathayam ukta _m_ tad atrapy anuvartate; tesha _m_ tatra parima\n_n_ a _m_ noktam atra sha _t_ tri _m_ sad a _s_ vasahasra _n_ i rakshi _n_ am\nanu _k_ arabhntany udga _k_ _kh_ antity aha; trayastri _m_ _s_ a _s_ _k_\nodirate sha _d_ _dh_ i(?) varmi _n_ a _m_ padanetasu (?) ga _k_ _kh_ antiti.\nHarisvamin.\n\n[401:1](sbe44109.htm#fr_1052) Why these are here put before the P _ri_ sh _th_\nas, is not clear.\n\n[401:2](sbe44109.htm#fr_1053) Perhaps we ought here to read 'Satra _g_ ita.'\n\n[401:3](sbe44109.htm#fr_1054) Unless the Gatha in the preceding paragraph\n(being in the Trish _t_ ubh metre) is really counted as two, the author seems\nhere purposely to have omitted a verse. Possibly, however, it may mean, 'the\nfourth,' viz. referring to [paragraph 14](sbe44109.htm#13:5:4:14).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 6, 1. Sixth Adhyaya. First Brahma _n_ a](sbe44110.htm)\n\n"
