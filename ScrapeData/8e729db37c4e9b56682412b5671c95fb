When the mother has bestowed (a portion of) her property on any (of her sons) from affection, the rule is the same in that case also; for the mother is equal to the father (as regards her competence to bestow gifts).\n\n* 8. 8 What (was given) before the (nuptial) fire, what (was given) during the bridal procession, the husband\'s donation, and what was received from her brother, mother, or father, that is called the sixfold property of a woman (Stridhana).\n\np. 191\n\n* 9. 9 Such property of a woman shall go to her offspring; if she have no offspring, it is declared to go to her husband (if she was married to him) according to one of the four (praiseworthy) marriage forms, beginning with the Brahma form; (if she was married) according to one of the other forms, it shall go to her parents.\n\n* 10. 10 When one brother maintains the family of another brother, who is engaged in studying science, he shall receive a share of the wealth gained by that study, though he be ignorant (himself).\n\n* 11. 11 A learned man is not bound to give a share of his own (acquired) wealth against his will to an unlearned co-heir, unless it have been gained by him using the paternal estate.\n\n* 12. 12 Two shares let the father keep for himself\n\np. 192\n\nwhen distributing his property. The mother shall receive the same share as a\nson (when the sons divide the property) after her husband\'s death.\n\n* 13. 13 To the eldest son a larger share shall be allotted, and a less share is assigned to the youngest son. The rest shall take equal shares, and so shall an unmarried sister.\n\n* 14. 14 The same rule applies to sons of a wife (Kshetra _g_ as) lawfully begotten on her. For sons of lower caste, a decrease in the shares according to the order (of their caste) is ordained, in case they are born of women legally married.\n\n* 15. 15 When a father has distributed his property amongst his sons, that is a lawful distribution for them (and cannot be annulled), whether the share of one be less, or greater than, or equal to the shares of the rest; for the father is the lord of all.\n\np. 193\n\n* 16. 16 A father who is diseased, or angry, or absorbed by (sinful) worldly interests, or who acts illegally, has not the power to distribute his property (as he likes).\n\n* 17. 17 The son of a maiden, a son obtained through a pregnant bride, and one born of a woman (whose transgression was) unknown (at first and is found out subsequently): of these, the mother\'s husband is regarded as the father, and they are declared to be entitled to shares of his property.\n\n* 18. A maiden\'s son, whose father is unknown and whose mother is not legally married (to his father), shall give a funeral ball (of rice) to his maternal grandfather and inherit his property.\n\n* 19. 19 Those sons who have been begotten by one or by many on a woman not authorized (to raise issue to her deceased husband), shall all be disinherited;\n\np. 194\n\nthey are the sons of their (respective) begetters only.\n\n* 20. 20 They shall offer the funeral ball (of rice) to their begetter, in case their mother had been obtained for a price; if no price has been paid for her, they shall give the funeral ball to the husband (of their mother).\n\n* 21. 21 One hostile to his father, or expelled from caste, or impotent, or guilty of a minor offence, shall not even take a share (of the inheritance), if he is a legitimate son; much less so, if he is a (Kshetra _g_ a) son of the wife (only).\n\n* 22. 22 Persons afflicted with a chronic or acute disease, or idiotic, or mad, or blind, or lame (are also incapable of inheriting). They shall be maintained by the family; but their sons shall receive their respective shares (of the inheritance).\n\n* 23. 23 The sons of two fathers shall give the funeral\n\np. 195\n\nball (of rice) and the water oblations to each of the two (fathers) singly,\nand shall receive one half of the property left by their natural and adoptive\nfathers.\n\n* 24. 24 That portion (of the property) which belongs to a reunited coparcener is declared to be absolutely his own. So when one of the sharers has no issue it shall go to the rest (after the death) of those who are childless.\n\n* 25. 25 If among several brothers one childless should die or become a religious ascetic, the others shall divide his property, excepting the Stridhana.\n\np. 196\n\n* 26. 26 They shall make provision for his women till they die, in case they remain faithful to the bed of their husband. Should the women not (remain chaste), they must cut off that allowance.\n\n* 27. 27 If he has left a daughter, her father\'s share is destined for her maintenance. They shall maintain her up to the time of her marriage; afterwards let her husband keep her.\n\n* 28. 28 After the death of her lord, the relations of her husband shall be the guardians of a woman who has no son. They shall have full authority to control her, to regulate her mode of life, and to maintain her.\n\n* 29. 29 When the husband\'s family is extinct, or contains no male, or when it is reduced to poverty, or when no one related to it within the degree of a Sapi _n_ _d_ a is left, the father\'s relations shall be the guardians of a woman.\n\n* 30. 30 It is through independence that women go\n\np. 197\n\nto ruin, though born in a noble family. Therefore the Lord of creatures has\nassigned a dependent condition to them.\n\n* 31. The father protects her during her infancy, the husband protects her when she is grown up, and the sons (protect her) in her old age. A woman is unfit to enjoy independence.\n\n* 32. 32 What is left (of the father\'s property), when the father\'s obligations have been discharged, and when the father\'s debts have been paid, shall be divided by the brothers, in order that the father may not continue a debtor.\n\n* 33. 33 For those (brothers), for whom the initiatory ceremonies have not been duly performed by their father, they must be performed by the (other) brothers, (defraying the expense) from the paternal property.\n\np. 198\n\n* 34. Or, no paternal wealth being left, the initiatory ceremonies must be invariably performed for their brothers by those previously initiated contributing (the required) funds from their own portions.\n\n* 35. 35 One who, being authorized to look after the affairs of the family, charges himself with the management (of the family property), shall be supported by his brothers with (presents of) food, clothing, and vehicles.\n\n* 36. 36 When the fact of a legal partition should be called into question, the decision of the dispute (which has arisen) among the sharers shall be founded on (the testimony of) kinsmen, the written deed recording the division of the estate, and the separate transaction of business.\n\n* 37. 37 Among unseparated brothers, the performance of religious duties is single. When they have come to a partition, they have to perform their religious duties each for himself.\n\np. 199\n\n* 38. 38 Giving, receiving, cattle, food, houses, fields, and servants must be regarded as separate among divided brothers, and so must cooking, religious duties, income, and expenditure (be kept separate for each of them).\n\n* 39. 39 (The acts of) giving evidence, of becoming a surety, of giving, and of taking, may be mutually performed by divided brothers, but not by unseparated ones.\n\n* 40. If (brothers or others) should transact such matters as these publicly with their co-heirs, they may be presumed to be separate in affairs, even though no written record (of the partition) be in existence.\n\n* 41. 41 Those brothers who for ten years continue to live separate in point of religious duties and business transactions, should be regarded as separate; that is a settled rule.\n\n* 42. 42 When a number of persons, the descendants of one man, are separate in point of (the performance of) religious duties, business transactions, and working\n\np. 200\n\nutensils, and do not consult each other about their dealings,\n\n* 43. They are quite at liberty to perform, according to pleasure, all (such transactions as) the gift or sale of their own shares. They are (in fact) masters of their own wealth.\n\n* 44. 44 One born after partition shall receive his father\'s property exclusively. Or, if other sharers have reunited with the father, they shall come to a division (with the son born after partition). Such is the law.\n\n* 45. 45 The legitimate son of the body, the son begotten on a wife (Kshetra _g_ a), the son of an (appointed) daughter, the son of a maiden, the son received with the wife, the son secretly born,\n\n* 46. The son of a remarried woman, the son cast off, the adopted son, the son bought, the son made, and the son who has offered himself, are declared to be the twelve sons.\n\n* 47. Among these, six are kinsmen and heirs, and six are not heirs (but) kinsmen. Each preceding one is declared to be superior (to the one\n\np. 201\n\nfollowing next), and each following one inferior (to the preceding one).\n\n[48. 48 Where some doubt arises in regard to a house or field, the possession\nof which has suffered an interruption, (the doubt) may be removed by\nconsulting a writing, or persons who know all about the enjoyment (of the\nproperty in question by its occupant), or witnesses.]\n\n* 49. After their father\'s death, these (sons) shall succeed to his wealth in order. Whenever a superior son is wanting, the one next to him in rank is entitled to succession.\n\n* 50. 50 On failure of a son, the daughter (succeeds), because she continues the lineage just like (a son); both a son and a daughter continue the lineage of their father.\n\n* 51. 51 On failure of daughters, the Sakulyas (are to succeed) and (after them) the Bandhavas; next, a member of the same caste. In default of all, that (wealth) goes to the king,\n\np. 202\n\n* 52. 52 Unless it should be the property of a Brahman. A king devoted to duty must allot a maintenance to his women. Thus has the law of inheritance been declared.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[188:1](sbe3345.htm#fr_564) XIII, 1. The term \'sons\' includes by implication\ngrandsons and p. 189 more remote descendants. The term \'paternal\' includes\nproperty of the grandfather and more remote ancestors as well. Mandlik\'s\nMayukha, p. 33 (IV, 3, 1, Borrodaile). Analogous remarks are found in most\nother Commentaries.\n\n[189:2](sbe3345.htm#fr_565) \'Their issue\' (tadanvaya _h_ ). According to the\nusual explanation, the male issue of the daughters is meant. However, there is\nnothing in the text to warrant an exclusion of the female issue of daughters.\nManu IX, 104, 192; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 117; Gautama XXVIII, 1; Baudhayana\nII, 3, 8.\n\n[189:3](sbe3345.htm#fr_566) According to the Mayukha, the clause \'when the\nsisters are married\' has to be construed with both the preceding and following\nclauses, the marriage of the sisters being required to precede both a division\nin the father\'s lifetime and a division in the mother\'s lifetime. See Mayukha,\np. 33 (translation, p. 39). The Dayabhaga has a totally different reading of\nthis text, which is censured in the Viramitrodaya. Gautama XXVIII, 1.\n\n[189:4](sbe3345.htm#fr_567) The Dayabhaga (II, 82, Colebrooke) states\ncorrectly that the unequal distribution referred to in the last clause of this\ntext must be different from that sort of unequal distribution under which the\neldest son is to receive a larger share than the rest. The Mitakshara school,\non the other hand, recognises two different modes of p. 190 distribution only:\none equal, and the other with the customary deductions in favour of the eldest\nson, middlemost son, &c., according to the order of seniority. The writers of\nthis school, therefore, have endeavoured to refute the interpretation of the\nDayabhaga. See Viramitrodaya, transl., p. 54.\xc2\x97Manu IX, 112 foll.; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_\navalkya II, 114; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 14; Gautama XXVIII, 2; Vish _n_ u XVII, 1;\nBaudhayana II, 3, 9.\n\n[190:5](sbe3345.htm#fr_568) As the management of the property and government\nof the family, under this rule, may devolve on the youngest brother even, it\nfollows that the middlemost brother may get it a fortiori. This is expressly\nstated in the Dayabhaga (III, 1, 15, Colebrooke). Manu IX, 108.\n\n[190:6](sbe3345.htm#fr_569) \'What was received at the time of obtaining a wife\nis here called the "wealth of a wife;" meaning effects obtained on account of\nmarriage.\' Dayabhaga (VI, I, 13, Colebrooke); Manu IX, 206; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\nII, 119.\n\n[190:8](sbe3345.htm#fr_570) It may be asked by whom the gifts presented before\nthe nuptial fire and during the bridal procession, i.e. at two different\nstages of the marriage ceremony, must have been presented in p. 191 order to\nbe Stridhana. As all the other gifts classed as Stridhana are presented by\nrelations, it may be inferred that the nuptial gifts have to come from the\nsame quarter. Katyayana declares expressly that a gift made by a stranger is\nnot Stridhana. Manu IX, 194; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 143, 144; Vish _n_ u XVII,\n18.\n\n[191:9](sbe3345.htm#fr_571) See XII, 38 foll. The commentators are of opinion\nthat the Gandharva form of marriage follows the same rule as those four forms\nwhich are referred to in the first half of this text. This, however, is an\nartificial interpretation, which has merely been devised for the purpose of\nmaking this text agree with an analogous rule of Manu (IX, 196). Manu IX,\n195-197; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 144, 145; Vish _n_ u XVII, 19-21; Vasish _th_\na XVII, 46; Baudhayana II, 2, 3, 43. Read _k_ aturshvahu _h_ in the text.\n\n[191:10](sbe3345.htm#fr_572) _S_ rik _ri_ sh _n_ a observes that where the\nsupport has been offered by several unlearned co-heirs, they shall all of them\nbe made to participate in the gains of science. See Colebrooke\'s Dayabhaga,\nVI, 1, 15, note.\n\n[191:11](sbe3345.htm#fr_573) \'The word "paternal" intends joint property.\'\nDayabhaga VI, 1, 17; Manu IX, 206; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 119; Gautama XXVIII,\n30.\n\n[191:12](sbe3345.htm#fr_574) The rule which assigns two shares to a father\ndistributing p. 192 his property himself, is referred to the father\'s self-\nacquired property in the Mitakshara school, and to ancestral property in the\nBengal school. This difference of interpretation is connected with the varying\nviews taken in the several schools of law of the extent of the patria potestas\nin questions of proprietary right and inheritance. See Dayabhaga II, 35,\nColebrooke; Mitakshara I, 5, 7, Colebrooke. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 123; Vish\n_n_ u XVIII, 34.\n\n[192:13](sbe3345.htm#fr_575) The share of an unmarried daughter, according to\nthe translation here given, would have to be equal to the shares of the\nmiddlemost brothers. According to _G_ agannatha, all that is meant by Narada\nis this, that the daughter shall receive some portion of the property, the\nprecise amount of it being left undecided. Sec Colebrooke\'s Digest, V, 1,\n71.\xc2\x97Manu IX, 113-118; Vish _n_ u XVII, 37; XVIII, 35; Baudhayana II, 3, 9;\nGautama XXVIII, 5-13; Vasish _th_ a XVII, 42 foll.; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 14, 6-10;\nYa _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 114, 124.\n\n[192:14](sbe3345.htm#fr_576) For the rules regarding the procreation of a\nKshetra _g_ a son, see XII, 80-88. Gautama XXVIII, 35-39; Vasish _th_ a XVII,\n47-50; Vish _n_ u XVIII, 1-31; Baudhayana II, 3, 10; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II,\n125; Manu IX, 149-156.\n\n[192:15](sbe3345.htm#fr_577) The writers of the Bengal school give this text\nits plain p. 193 meaning, viz. that a father may distribute his property among\nhis sons as he pleases. They add, however, that in doing so he must be guided\nby lawful motives, such as compassion on an incapable son, partiality for a\npious son, and the like. See Dayabhaga II, 74, 75 Colebrooke\'s Digest, V, 1,\n32. The Mayukha, on the other hand, declares that this rule of Narada had\nlegal force in the former ages of the world only. See Mandlik\'s Mayukha, p. 35\n(transl. p. 43). Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 116.\n\n[193:16](sbe3345.htm#fr_578) This rule \'relates to the case where the father,\nthrough perturbation of mind occasioned by disease or the like, or through\nirritation against any one of his sons, or through partiality for the child of\na favourite wife, makes a distribution not conformable to law.\' Colebrooke\'s\nDayabhaga II, 83. The Mitakshara (I, 2, 13, 54), cutting down the privileges\nof the father everywhere, interprets this rule as a prohibition of any other\nmode of unequal distribution except that by which the customary deductions are\nmade in favour of the eldest son, &c.\n\n[193:17](sbe3345.htm#fr_579) 17, 18. Manu IX, 170-172; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II,\n129; Vish _n_ u XV, 10-17; Vasish _th_ a XVII, 21-23.\n\n[193:19](sbe3345.htm#fr_580) Regarding the rule of Niyoga, or appointment of a\nmarried p. 194 woman or widow to raise offspring to her husband, see XII,\n80-88; Manu IX, 143.\n\n[194:20](sbe3345.htm#fr_581) See XII, 54.\n\n[194:21](sbe3345.htm#fr_582) 21, 22. Manu IX, 201-203; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 14, 1,\n15; Gautama XXVIII, 23, 40, 43; Vasish _th_ a XVII, 52, 53; Baudhayana II, 3,\n37-40; Vish _n_ u XV, 32-37; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 140, 141.\n\n21\\. The commentators are at variance as to the precise meaning of the term\n\'hostile to his father.\' Thus the Sarasvativilasa declares it to denote one\nwho forgets himself so far as to say, \'He is not my father.\' The\nDayakramasa\xe1\xb9\x85graha says it means one who beats his father. According to _G_\nagannatha and the Ratnakara, it means \'one who attempts his father\'s life or\ncommits other hostile acts against him (mara _n_ adik _ri_ t), and who fails\nto offer the customary funeral oblations to his father after his death.\' See\nColebrooke\'s Digest, V, 4, 320.\n\n[194:22](sbe3345.htm#fr_583) Atrophy or pulmonary consumption is instanced as\na chronic, and leprosy as an acute disease, in the Ratnakara. See Colebrooke\'s\nDigest, loc. cit.\n\n[194:23](sbe3345.htm#fr_584) \'The adoptive father,\' literally \'the man who\nowns the p. 195 mother\' (Kshetrika). The \'son of two fathers\' is no doubt one\nprocreated by Niyoga on the wife of one impotent, &c. It is not equally clear\nwhy he is to obtain one half only of the property left by his two fathers, as\nhe is elsewhere declared to succeed to both. According to the Ratnakara, this\nrule \'relates to the case where the natural father has a son begotten in\nlawful wedlock, and the husband of the mother also has by some means (katha\n_m_ _k_ it) obtained male issue by himself begotten.\' See Colebrooke\'s Digest,\nV, 4, 242.\xc2\x97Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 127; Manu IX, 145, 190; Baudhayana II, 3,\n18, 19.\n\n[195:24](sbe3345.htm#fr_585) For several other interpretations of this\ndifficult text, see Colebrooke\'s Digest, V, 8, 433. It has to be observed,\nhowever, that the reading translated here differs from the reading translated\nby Colebrooke.\n\n[195:25](sbe3345.htm#fr_586) 25, 26. The fact that the widow is invested with\na claim to maintenance merely under this text, whereas the leading texts of Ya\n_g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya and Vish _n_ u constitute her heir to the property of a\nhusband who has died without leaving male issue, has caused some difficulty to\nthe commentators. Thus Madana says that this text must be held applicable to\nthe widow of an undivided or reunited coparcener only, who is given a mere\nclaim to maintenance by all writers of the Mitakshara school. The writers of\nthe Bengal school, on the other hand, recognise the widow\'s right of\ninheritance in the case of undivided coparceners even. It appears, however,\nfrom the order of heirs given in 49-51, that Narada does not make the widow an\nheir in any case.\n\n25\\. Manu IX, 212; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 138; Vish _n_ u XVII, 17; Gautama\nXVIII, 21.\n\n[196:26](sbe3345.htm#fr_587) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 142.\n\n[196:27](sbe3345.htm#fr_588) \'They shall maintain her,\' literally \'they shall\ngive her a share.\' See par. 13, where a share is allotted to an unmarried\nsister. The maintenance of the daughter includes, no doubt, the obligation to\ndefray the expense of her marriage. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 141.\n\n[196:28](sbe3345.htm#fr_589) All the commentators declare that the right of\nguardianship goes in the order of proximity. \'Thus, without (her guardian\'s)\nconsent, she may not give away anything to any person; nor indulge herself in\nmatters of shape, taste, smell, and the like; and if the means of subsistence\nbe wanting he must provide her maintenance.\' _G_ agannatha. See Colebrooke\'s\nDigest, IV, I, 13.\n\n[196:29](sbe3345.htm#fr_590) The Nepalese MS. and the commentaries insert the\nfollowing text here: * \'If both families are extinct, the king is declared to\nbe the protector of a woman; he shall provide for her and punish her when she\nhas swerved from the path of duty.\'\n\n[196:30](sbe3345.htm#fr_591) 30, 31. Vasish _th_ a V, 1, 2; Baudhayana II, 3,\n44, 45; Gautama p. 197 XVIII, 1; Manu IX, 3; V, 148; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya I, 85;\nVish _n_ u XXV, 12, 13. p. 197\n\n30\\. \'They go to ruin,\' i.e. they are guilty of disloyalty and other offences;\nthus, because they do not know what is legal for those who live exactly\naccording to sacred ordinances, and because they cannot be instructed, they\nwould violate the duties of their class and the like. _G_ agannatha. See\nColebrooke\'s Digest, IV, 1, 4.\n\n[197:32](sbe3345.htm#fr_592) The term pit _ri_ dayebhyo, \'when the father\'s\nobligations have been discharged,\' is differently explained by different\ncommentators. Thus Varadara _g_ a (Burnell\'s Vyavaharanir _n_ aya, p. 18) says\nit denotes the father\'s funeral rites and the like. A _k_ yuta, as quoted in\nColebrooke\'s Dayabhaga I, 47, note, refers it to sums of which payment has\nbeen promised by the father. Manu VIII, 166; IX, 204; Baudhayana II, 3, 8;\nGautama XXVIII, 1; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 117. Read dattvar _n_ a _m_ in the\ntext.\n\n[197:33](sbe3345.htm#fr_593) There appears to be some doubt as to what is\nmeant here by the term sa _m_ skara, \'initiatory or sacramental ceremonies,\'\nsome commentators including the ceremony of marriage in that term, and others\ndeclaring the initiatory ceremonies to terminate with the investiture with the\nsacred thread. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 224.\n\n[198:35](sbe3345.htm#fr_594) Some commentators explain this text as having\nreference to one who generously declines to take his share at the time of\npartition. His share shall be made up afterwards by the other brothers\ncontributing severally a portion of their shares. However, there seems to be\nmore foundation for the opinion of those commentators who interpret this text\nas ordaining the allotment of a preferential share or the presentation of\nspecial gifts to the manager of the family property. See Colebrooke\'s Digest,\nV, 2, 108.\n\n[198:36](sbe3345.htm#fr_595) The commentators observe that the contest here\nreferred to does not turn on the mode but on the fact of partition. See\nColebrooke\'s Digest, V, 6, 381. The business here referred to consists of\nagriculture and the like acts, according to the Mitakshara. Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya\nII, 149.\n\n[198:37](sbe3345.htm#fr_596) The term \'religious duties,\' according to the\nMitakshara, relates principally to the five Mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as, \'great\nsacrifices\' or \'sacraments.\' Before division they are performed by one\nbrother, generally the eldest brother, as representative of the rest. Manu IX,\nIII; Gautama XXVIII, 4.\n\n[199:38](sbe3345.htm#fr_597) \'Giving and receiving,\' without consulting each\nother. Purchase of \'cattle\' and the like. See Colebrooke\'s Digest, V, 6, 380.\nThe upshot of a long discussion of this text by _G_ agannatha is this, that\nnone of the acts mentioned here may be regarded as conclusive evidence by\nitself, a great deal of collective evidence of all sorts having to be adduced\nin each case. See Colebrooke\'s Digest, V, 6, 387.\n\n[199:39](sbe3345.htm#fr_598) Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 52.\n\n[199:41](sbe3345.htm#fr_599) The term \'brothers\' is here used to denote\ncoparceners generally. Sm _ri_ ti _k_ andrika XVI, 14. The Sarasvativilasa (\xc2\xa7\n812, Foulkes) contests the correctness of this interpretation. The Nepalese\nMS. does not give this paragraph, and it is elsewhere attributed to B _ri_\nhaspati.\n\n[199:42](sbe3345.htm#fr_600) 42, 43. \'Religious duties,\' prescribed\nobservances, such as the five great sacrifices (Mahaya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as). \'Business\ntransactions,\' such as p. 200 trading and the like acts. \'Working utensils,\'\nsuch as household furniture, the separate possession of which is indicative of\npartition. The meaning is that, when they are separated thus, each may give,\nsell, or otherwise dispose of (his share). Mayukha, p. 51 (transl. p. 76).\n\n[200:44](sbe3345.htm#fr_601) Manu IX, 216; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II, 122; Gautama\nXXVIII, 29; Vish _n_ u XVII, 3. This text is not found in the Nepalese MS.,\nnor is it commonly quoted in the Digests.\n\n[200:45](sbe3345.htm#fr_602) 45-47, 49. Manu IX, 158-184; Vish _n_ u XV, 1-29;\nVasish _th_ a XVII, 12-39; Baudhayana II, 2, 3, 14-32; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II,\n128-132.\n\n45, 46. Regarding the meaning of the technical terms in this text, see the\ncorresponding portion of the Code of Manu, and the notes on them in Professor\nBuhler\'s translation.\n\n[201:48](sbe3345.htm#fr_603) This text, which comes in very awkwardly between\npars. 47 and 49, is apparently spurious, as has been pointed out long ago by\nProfessor Buhler. It is not given in the Nepalese MS.\n\n[201:50](sbe3345.htm#fr_604) _G_ imutavahana and other writers of the Bengal\nschool restrict the daughter\'s right of succession, as declared in this text,\nto those daughters who are neither barren nor widowed. See Dayabhaga IV, 2,\n10. However, there is nothing in the words of the original to warrant this\nrestriction. \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 14, 4.\n\n[201:51](sbe3345.htm#fr_605) 51, 52. Manu IX, 185-189; Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya II,\n135, 136; Vasish _th_ a XVII, 81-8 Vish _n_ u XVII, 1; \xc3\x82pastamba II, 6, 1 2-5;\nGautama XXVIII, 21, 41, 42.\n\n51\\. The term Sakulya is apparently used to denote the agnates, and Bandhava\nto denote the cognates. Therefore the last term sa _g_ ati cannot be referred\nto blood-relationship at all, and must denote connexion by membership of the\nsame caste. It is true that the commentators explain it as denoting descent\nfrom the same _Ri_ shi. See Colebrooke\'s Digest, V, 8, 448.\n\n[202:52](sbe3345.htm#fr_606) \'His women,\' i.e. the women of the deceased\nproprietor. Vi _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ ane _s_ vara, Nilaka _n_ _th_ a, and other commentators\ndeclare that the term stri, \'woman,\' cannot denote the legitimate wives of a\ndeceased heir, and must therefore mean his concubines. This interpretation has\nbeen called forth, no doubt, by the fact that, in the opinion of these\ncommentators, the inheritance of one sonless belongs to the widow in the first\ninstance, and does not go to others, where a legitimate widow is in existence.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Fourteenth Title of Law.
