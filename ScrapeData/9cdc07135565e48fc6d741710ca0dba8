Scripture also declares this.\n\nScripture also shows that (identical) meditation is what all the Vedanta-texts\nintimate. The _Kh_ andogya (VIII, 1, 1 ff.) declares that that which is within\nthe small space in the heart is to be enquired into, and then in reply to the\n\np. 632\n\nquestion what the thing to be enquired into is, says that it is the highest\nSelf possessing the eight attributes, freedom from all evil and the rest,\nwhich is to be meditated upon within the heart. And then the Taittiriya-text,\nreferring to this declaration in the _Kh_ andogya, says, 'Therein is a small\nspace, free from all grief; what is within that is to be meditated upon'\n(Mahanar. Up. X, 23), and thus likewise enjoins meditation on the highest Self\npossessing the eight qualities. And this is possible only if, owing to unity\nof vidya, the qualities mentioned in the first text are included also in the\nmeditation enjoined in the second text.--Having thus established the unity of\nmeditations, the Sutras proceed to state the practical effect of such unity.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 5.
