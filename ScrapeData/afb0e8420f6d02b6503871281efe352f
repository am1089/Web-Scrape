The syllable \'Om\' is the essence of all the Vedas, illuminating the Truth.\nHow thereby to secure balance of mind will be shown to those who wish for\nliberation.\n\n#### The Avyakrita.\n\n2\\. There was the One Supreme Brahman, the ever Unbound and Immutable. By\nassociation with Its own Maya, It became the Seed, the _Avy akrita_ or\nUndifferentiated Cause of matter.\n\n#### The Sutra or Hiranyagarbha.\n\np. 192\n\n3\\. Thence was Akasa born, the _Sabda-tanm atra_, sound in essence; thence\ncame Vayu, the _Sparsa-tanm atra_, touch in essence; thence Tejas, _R upa-\ntanmatra_, colour in essence; thence Waters, _Rasa-tanm atra_, sapidity in\nessence; thence Earth, _Gandha-tanm atra_, odour in essence. Akasa has the\nsole quality of sound; Vayu has the qualities of sound and touch; Tejas has\nthree qualities,--sound, touch, and colour; Waters have four qualities,--\nsound, touch, colour and sapidity; Earth has five qualities,--sound, touch,\ncolour, sapidity and smell. From them was produced the great _S utra_ or\n_Linga_ , ensouling all.\n\np. 193\n\n#### The Viraj.\n\n4\\. Thence came the five gross elements, and out of these came the Viraj into\nbeing. When bhutas or elements are quintupled, they are said by the wise to\nbecome gross elements.--Let each of the five elements, such as earth, be\ndivided into two halves; and let one half of each be again divided into four\nparts, and let one of these parts\n\np. 194\n\nof one element be combined with the other elements, one part with each. Thus\nin the element of akasa there are five parts, four of which are parts of Vayu\nand the rest. * The same principle should be applied to Vayu, etc. Those who\nknow truth declare that such is the quintupling of the elements. The elements\nthus quintupled, together with their products, go to form the Viraj. This is\nthe sthula or gross body of Atman who has (really) no body whatever.\n\n#### Three aspects of the manifested Brahman.\n\np. 195 p. 196\n\n5\\. Threefold, as the _Adhidaiva_ (the region of Cosmic Intelligences), as the\n_Adhy atma_ (the individual man), as the _Adhibh uta_ (the external visible\nworld), does the One Brahman appear in [different](errata.htm#26) forms, as\nshown below, owing to illusion; not in reality:--\n\np. 197\n\nAdhyatma.\n\n|\n\nAdhibhuta.\n\n|\n\nAdhidaiva.  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \nThe organ of\n\n|\n\nSound, the object of\n\n|\n\nDis, _Space_.  \n  \n    \xe2\x80\x9e    hearing\n\n|\n\nthe sense of hearing\n\n|\n\n  \n  \n    \xe2\x80\x9e    touch\n\n|\n\nTouch, \xe2\x80\x9e touch\n\n|\n\nVayu, the _Air_.  \n  \n    \xe2\x80\x9e    sight\n\n|\n\nColour, \xe2\x80\x9e sight\n\n|\n\nAditya, the _Sun_.  \n  \n    \xe2\x80\x9e    taste\n\n|\n\nSapidity, \xe2\x80\x9e taste\n\n|\n\nVaruna.  \n  \n    \xe2\x80\x9e    smell\n\n|\n\nOdour, \xe2\x80\x9e smell\n\n|\n\nThe Asvins.  \n  \n         Tongue\n\n|\n\nspeech\n\n|\n\nAgni, _Fire_.  \n  \n         Hands\n\n|\n\nObjects to be grasped\n\n|\n\nIndra.  \n  \n         Feet\n\n|\n\nObjects to be gone to\n\n|\n\nVishnu.  \n  \n         The anus\n\n|\n\nExcretions\n\n|\n\nMrityu, Death  \n  \nThe organ of generation\n\n|\n\nSex and such objects of pleasure\n\n|\n\nPrajapati,  \n  \n         Manas\n\n|\n\nObjects of thought\n\n|\n\nChandra, the Moon.  \n  \n         Buddhi\n\n|\n\nObjects of understanding\n\n|\n\nBrihaspati.  \n  \n         Ahankara\n\n|\n\nObjects of Egoism\n\n|\n\nRudra.  \n  \n         Chitta\n\n|\n\nObjects retained in thought\n\n|\n\nKshetrajna.  \n  \nTamas or Ajnana.\n\n|\n\nThe various forms of darkness\n\n|\n\nIsvara.  \n  \n\n\n#### Visva and His unity with the Viraj\n\np. 198\n\n6\\. The cognising by external and internal organs of sensation,--helped by the\nco-operation of the several Intelligences (Devatas),--of their respective\nobjects is said to be the jagrat state. The Atman identifying Himself with\nthis jagrat state, and with the physical body, which is the seat of the sense\norgans, is called Vis\'va. One should regard Vis\'va in the form of the Viraj,\nfor the cessation of difference.\n\n#### Taijasa and His unity with the Hiranyagarbha\n\np. 199\n\n7\\. The _S ukshina-Sarira_ or subtle body of the Pratyagatman, which is but\nillusory, comprises the following:--\n\n(1) The five organs of sensation, namely, the organs of hearing, touch, sight,\nsmell and taste.\n\n(2) The five organs of activity, namely, the organ of speech, hands, feet, the\nanus and the organ of generation.\n\n(3) The fourfold internal organ as made up of _Manas_ , composed of formative\nthoughts: _Buddhi_ , which is of the nature\n\np. 200\n\nof determination; _Ahankara_ , the Egoism making up the personality; and\n_Chitta_ , the faculty of reflection.\n\n(4) The five functions of prana or vital force; namely, prana, apana, vyana,\nudana, and samana.\n\n(5) The _puryashtaka_ or the eight regions, comprising the five subtle\nelements such as akasa (ether), vayu (air), fire, water, earth; as well as\navidya, kama, and karma. They say that this _puryashtaka_ is called _Linga-\nsarira_.\n\nThe consciousness which, during the quiescence of the sense-organs, arises in\nthe form of the percipient and objects of perception manifested in virtue of\nthe samskaras or latent impressions of the jagrata state, is called _svapna_.\nThe entity who indentifies himself with these, _i.e._ , with the subtle body\nand the svapna state, is termed _Taijasa_. The wise man should think of the\nTaijasa as one with the Hiranyagarbha.\n\np. 201\n\n#### Prajna and His unity with I\'s\'vara\n\n8\\. The ignorance or nescience of \xc3\x82tman blended with a semblance of\nconsciousness, is the cause of the two bodies ( _Sth ula_, and _S ukshma_);\nand it is called _Avyakta_ the Unmanifested, and _Avy akrita_, the\nUndifferentiated. It is neither existent, nor non-existent, nor both existent\nand non-existent. It is neither distinct (from Brahman) nor non-distinct, nor\nboth (distinct and non-distinct). It is neither made of parts, nor partless,\nnor both\n\np. 202\n\n[paragraph continues] (made of parts and partless). It is removed by the\nknowledge of the unity of Brahman and Atman, inasmuch as it is false. The\ncessation of all cognitions, the state of Buddhi remaining in the form of its\ncause as the fig-tree remains in the fig-seed, is called _sushupti_. The\nentity who identifies himself with these two (with Avyakta and Sushupti) is\ncalled Prajna. One should regard Prajna-Atman as one with (I\'s\'vara or\nAkshara) the Cause of the universe.\n\n#### The One Reality\n\n9\\. The one Reality, which is consciousness in essence, appears by illusion as\ndifferent, in the form of Vis\'va, Taijasa, and Prajna; as also in the form of\nViraj, Sutra and Akshara. Since the three entities,\n\np. 203\n\nsuch as Vis\'va, Taijasa and Prajna are one with the three entities such as\nViraj, Sutra and Akshara, one should regard them all as one and the same, so\nthat the absence of all else may become manifest.\n\n#### Contemplation of A\'tman by Pranava.\n\n10\\. The whole universe, composed of Prajna and so on, is one with the\nsyllable \'Om\'; for, the universe is made up of designations and the\ndesignated, which are never in fact [perceived](errata.htm#27) separately.\nVisva is one with the syllable \' _a_ \'; the syllable \' _u_ \' is said to be one\nwith Taijasa, and the syllable \' _m_ \' is one with Prajna. In this order one\nshould regard them.\n\np. 204\n\nII. Prior to the time of _Sam adhi_, one should thus contemplate with much\neffort and then dissolve the whole universe in the Conscious Self, step by\nstep, dissolving the gross in the subtler one. The devotee should dissolve the\nsyllable \' _a_ ,\' the Visva aspect of the Self, in the syllable \' _u_ \'; and\nthe syllable \' _u_ ,\' the subtle Taijasa, in the syllable \' _m_ \'; the\nsyllable \' _m_ ,\' the Prajna, in the Chidatman, the Conscious Self. "I am the\nConscious Self, the Eternal, Pure, Wise, Liberated, Existent, Secondless; I am\nthe \'Om,\' Vasudeva, the Supreme\n\np. 205\n\n[paragraph continues] Bliss in its entirety;" having thus thought, he should\ndissolve even this discriminative thought (Chitta) in the Witness thereof.\nWhen dissolved in the conscious A\'tman, that thought should no longer be\ndisturbed He should remain as the all-full consciousness, like the full\nunmoving ocean.\n\nI2. Thus having attained balance in mind, endued with faith and devotion,\nhaving subdued the sense-organs, having overpowered anger, the Yogin should\nsee the secondless A\'tman. Because at the beginning, at the middle and at the\nend, all this is pain, therefore he should always firmly dwell in the Reality\nabandoning all.\n\n#### Ji\'vanmukti.\n\np. 206\n\n13\\. For him who sees the all-pervading tranquil, secondless, blissful A\'tman,\nthere remains nothing to be attained or known. Having achieved all\naspirations, he becomes wise; he always remains a\n\np. 207\n\n[paragraph continues] Ji\'vanmukta. Fixed in A\'tman with all his being, he\nnever indeed sees the universe. No doubt he becomes aware of the dual universe\noccasionally when he is awake to the world around; but then he sees it not as\nsomething different from the Conscious A\'tman, inasmuch as\n[Consciousness](errata.htm#28) runs through all. On the other hand, he sees\nthis universe as false, like the confusion of the four quarters, or like the\nappearance of many moons. Then, owing to the accumulated prarabdha-karma,--\nkarma which has already begun its effects,--he is aware of a semblance of the\nbody. The S\'ruti says that he has to wait only till death; and even the\ncontinuance of the prarabdha in the case of the liberated one is a mere\nillusion. This person, having known the Reality, is always free from bonds and\nnever otherwise. On the exhaustion of the fruits of the prarabdha, he attains\nat once to the Vishnu\'s state, which is beyond the darkness of avidya, free\nfrom all false\n\np. 208\n\nappearances,--the pure stainless Consciousness which is beyond the reach of\nthought and speech, free from all designations and designated objects, and\ndevoid of anything which has either to be acquired or cast aside; which is\nBliss and Wisdom in one solid mass.\n\n#### Conclusion.\n\n14\\. Therefore this tract should be learned by all devotees, endued with the\nattributes of pridelessness, etc., ( _vide_ Bhagavadgi\'ta, XII. 13-20), with\ndevotion\n\np. 209\n\nto the Guru and with His grace. The wise yogin should try and reflect upon\nthis vidya at all times of sandhya, not engrossed in the objects of pleasure,\nof this or the next world. He should always contemplate his own A\'tman who is\nfree from all attachment and hatred.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[194:*](dast15.htm#fr_3) The quintupled akasa, then, contains one half of pure\nakasa, the other half being composed of the other elements, each of which\nforms one eighth of the whole.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Daksinamurti-Upanishad](dast16.htm)\n\n'
