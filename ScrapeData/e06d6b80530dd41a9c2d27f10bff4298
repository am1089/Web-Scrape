Agni, the Gayatra (metre), the Triv _ri_ t (hymn), the Rathantara (song),\nthe spring, the upward breath (pra _n_ a), the Nakshatras, the Vasus\n(deities)--these rise in the East; they warm, they rain, they praise 1\n\np. 339\n\n[paragraph continues] (the sun), they enter again into him (the sun), they\nlook out from him (the sun). He (the sun) is inconceivable, without form,\ndeep, covered, blameless, solid, unfathomable, without qualities, pure,\nbrilliant, enjoying the play of the three qualities, awful, not caused, a\nmaster-magician 1, the omniscient, the mighty, immeasurable, without beginning\nor end, blissful, unborn, wise, indescribable, the creator of all things, the\nself of all things, the enjoyer of all things, the ruler of all things, the\ncentre of the centre of all things.\n\n2\\. Indra, the Trish _t_ ubh (metre), the Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ adasa (hymn), the B _ri_\nhat (song), the summer, the through-going breath (Vyana), Soma, the Rudras--\nthese rise in the South; they warm, they rain, they praise, they enter again\ninto him, they look out from him. He (the sun) is without end or beginning,\nunmeasured, unlimited, not to be moved by another, self-dependent, without\nsign, without form, of endless power, the creator, the maker of light.\n\n3\\. The Maruts, the _G_ agati (metre), the Saptada _s_ a (hymn), the Vairupa\n(song), the rainy season, the downward breath (apana), _S_ ukra, the \xc3\x82dityas--\nthese rise in the West; they warm, they rain, they praise, they enter again\ninto him, they look out from him. That is the tranquil, the soundless,\nfearless, sorrowless, joyful, satisfied, firm, immovable, immortal, eternal,\ntrue, the highest abode, bearing the name of Vish _n_ u.\n\n4\\. The Vi _s_ ve Devas, the Anush _t_ ubh (metre), the Ekavi _m_ sa (hymn),\nthe Vaira _g_ a (song), the autumn, the equal breath (samana), Varu _n_ a, the\nSadhyas--these rise in the North; they warm, they rain, they\n\np. 340\n\npraise, they enter again into him, they look out from him. He is pure within,\npurifying, undeveloped, tranquil, breathless, selfless, endless.\n\n5\\. Mitra-Varu _n_ au, the Pa\xe1\xb9\x85kti (metre), the Tri _n_ avatrayastri _m_ sa\n(hymns), the _S_ akvara-raivata (songs), the snowy and dewy seasons, the out-\ngoing breath (udana), the A\xe1\xb9\x85giras, the Moon--these rise above; they warm, they\nrain, they praise, they enter again into him, they look out from him--who is\ncalled Pra _n_ ava (Om), the leader, consisting of light, without sleep, old\nage, death, and sorrow.\n\n6\\. _S_ ani (Saturn), Rahu and Ketu (the ascending and descending nodes), the\nserpents, Rakshas, Yakshas, men, birds, _s_ arabhas, elephants, &c.--these\nrise below; they warm, they rain, they praise, they enter again into him, they\nlook out from him--he who is wise, who keeps things in their right place, the\ncentre of all, the imperishable, the pure, the purifier, the bright, the\npatient, the tranquil.\n\n7\\. And he is indeed the Self, smaller (than small) within the heart, kindled\nlike fire, endowed with all forms. Of him is all this food, within him all\ncreatures are woven. That Self is free from sin 1, free from old age, from\ndeath and grief, from hunger and thirst, imagining nothing but what it ought\nto imagine, and desiring nothing but what it ought to desire. He is the\nhighest lord, he is the supreme master of all beings, the guardian of all\nbeings, a boundary keeping all things apart in their right places 2. He the\nSelf, the lord, is indeed Sambhu, Bhava, Rudra, Pra _g_ apati, the creator of\nall, Hira _n_ yagarbha,\n\np. 341\n\nthe true, breath, the swan, the ruler, the eternal, Vish _n_ u, Naraya _n_ a.\nAnd he who abides in the fire, and he who abides in the heart, and he who\nabides in the sun, they are one and the same. To thee who art this, endowed\nwith all forms, settled in the true ether, be adoration!\n\n8\\. Now follow the impediments in the way of knowledge, O King 1! This is\nindeed the origin of the net of bewilderment, that one who is worthy of heaven\nlives with those who are not worthy of heaven. That is it. Though they have\nbeen told that there is a grove before them, they cling to a small shrub. And\nothers also who are always merry, always abroad, always begging, always making\na living by handiwork; and others who are begging in towns, performing\nsacrifices for those who are not allowed to offer sacrifices, who make\nthemselves the pupils of _S_ udras, and _S_ udras who know the sacred books;\nand others who are malignant, who use bad language, dancers, prize-fighters,\ntravelling mendicants, actors, those who have been degraded in the king\'s\nservice; and others who for money pretend that they can lay (the evil\ninfluences) of Yakshas, Rakshasas, ghosts, goblins, devils, serpents, imps,\n&c.; and others who falsely wear red dresses 2, earrings, and skulls; and\nothers who wish to entice by the jugglery of false arguments, mere comparisons\nand paralogisms, the believers in the Veda--with all these he should not\n\np. 342\n\nlive together. They are clearly thieves, and unworthy of heaven. And thus it\nis said:\n\n\'The world unsettled by the paralogisms of the denial of Self, by false\ncomparisons and arguments, does not know what is the difference between Veda\nand philosophy 1.\'\n\n9\\. B _ri_ haspati, having become _S_ ukra, brought forth that false knowledge\nfor the safety of Indra and for the destruction of the Asuras. By it they show\nthat good is evil, and that evil is good. They say that we ought to ponder on\nthe (new) law, which upsets the Veda and the other sacred books 2. Therefore\nlet no one ponder on that false knowledge: it is wrong, it is, as it were,\nbarren. Its reward lasts only as long as the pleasure lasts, as with one who\nhas fallen from his caste. Let that false science not be attempted, for thus\nit is said:\n\n(i) Widely opposed and divergent are these two, the one known as false\nknowledge, the other as knowledge. I (Yama) believe Na _k_ iketas to be\npossessed by a desire of knowledge; even many pleasures do not move thee 3.\n\n(2) He who knows at the same time both the imperfect (sacrifice, &c.) and the\nperfect knowledge (of the Self), he crosses death by means of the imperfect,\nand obtains immortality by means of the perfect knowledge 4.\n\n(3) Those who are wrapped up 5 in the midst of\n\np. 343\n\nimperfect knowledge, fancying themselves alone wise and learned, they wander\nabout floundering and deceived, like the blind led by the blind 1.\n\n10\\. The gods and the demons, wishing to know the Self, went into the presence\nof Brahman (their father, Pra _g_ apati) 2. Having bowed before him, they\nsaid: \'O blessed one, we wish to know the Self, do thou tell us.\' Then, after\nhaving pondered a long while, he thought, these demons are not yet self-\nsubdued 3; therefore a very different Self was told to them (from what was\ntold to the gods). On that Self these deluded demons take their stand,\nclinging to it, destroying the true means of salvation (the Veda), preaching\nuntruth. What is untrue they see as true, as in jugglery. Therefore, what is\ntaught in the Vedas, that is true. What is said in the Vedas, on that the wise\nkeep their stand. Therefore let a Brahman not read what is not of the Veda, or\nthis will be the result.\n\n11\\. This is indeed the nature of it (the Veda), the supreme light of the\nether which is within the heart. This is taught as threefold, in the fire, in\nthe sun, in the breath. This is indeed the nature of it, the syllable Om, of\nthe ether which is within the heart. By it (by the Om) that (light) starts,\nrises, breathes forth, becomes for ever the means of the worship and knowledge\nof Brahman. That (light, in the shape of\n\np. 344\n\n[paragraph continues] Om), when there is breathing, takes the place of the\ninternal heat, free from all brightness 1. This is like the action of smoke;\nfor when there is a breath of air, the smoke, first rising to the sky in one\ncolumn, follows afterwards every bough, envelopes it and takes its shape 2. It\nis like throwing salt (into water), like heating ghee 3. The Veda comes and\ngoes like the dissolving view of a master-magician 4. And here they quote:\n\n\'Why then is it called "like lightning?" Because as soon as it comes forth (as\nOm) it lights up the whole body. Therefore let a man worship that boundless\nlight by the syllable Om.\'\n\n(1) The man in the eye who abides in the right eye, he is Indra, and his wife\nabides in the left eye 5.\n\n(2) The union of these two takes place in the cavity within the heart, and the\nball of blood which is there, that is indeed the vigour and life of these two.\n\n(3) There is a channel going from the heart so far, and fixed in that eye;\nthat is the artery for both of them, being one, divided into two.\n\np. 345\n\n(4) The mind excites the fire of the body, that fire stirs the breath, and the\nbreath, moving in the chest, produces the low sound.\n\n(5) Brought forth by the touch of the fire, as with a churning-stick, it is at\nfirst a minim, from the minim it becomes in the throat a double minim; on the\ntip of the tongue know that it is a treble minim, and, when uttered, they call\nit the alphabet (\xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xcf\x87\xce\xb5\xe1\xbf\x96\xce\xb1) 1.\n\n(6) He who sees this, does not see death, nor disease, nor misery, for seeing\nhe sees all (objectively, not as affecting him subjectively); he becomes all\neverywhere (he becomes Brahman).\n\n(7) There is the person in the eye, there is he who walks as in sleep, he who\nis sound asleep, and he who is above the sleeper: these are the four\nconditions (of the Self), and the fourth is greater than all 2.\n\n(8) Brahman with one foot moves in the three, and Brahman with three feet is\nin the last.\n\np. 346\n\nIt is that both the true (in the fourth condition) and the untrue (in the\nthree conditions) may have their desert, that the Great Self (seems to) become\ntwo, yes, that he (seems to) become two 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[338:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1155) Other MSS. read sruvanti, which seems better.\n\n[339:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1156) See VII, 11, abhidhyatur vist _ri_ tir iva.\n\n[340:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1157) See _Kh_ and. Up. VIII, 7, 1.\n\n[340:2](sbe15118.htm#fr_1158) See _Kh_ and. Up. VIII, 4, 1, where we find\nsetur vidh _ri_ tir esha _m_ lokanam.\n\n[341:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1159) This king is not meant for B _ri_ hadratha.\n\n[341:2](sbe15118.htm#fr_1160) This refers to people who claim the privileges\nand licence of Sannyasins without having passed through the discipline of the\npreceding a _s_ ramas, As this was one of the chief complaints made against\nthe followers of _S_ akyamuni, it might refer to Buddhists, but it ought to be\nborne in mind that there were Buddhists before Buddha.\n\n[342:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1161) If we translate thus, the use of vidya for v\n_ri_ tha vidya is unusual; if we follow the commentary, we should have to\ntranslate, he does not know the Veda and the other knowledge.\n\n[342:2](sbe15118.htm#fr_1162) All this may refer to Buddhists, but not by\nnecessity, for there were heretics, such as B _ri_ haspati, long before _S_\nakyamuni.\n\n[342:3](sbe15118.htm#fr_1163) See Ka _th_. Up. II, 4.\n\n[342:4](sbe15118.htm#fr_1164) See Va _g_. Up. 11.\n\n[342:5](sbe15118.htm#fr_1165) Vesh _t_ yamana _h_ , instead of vartamana _h_.\n\n[343:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1166) See Ka _th_. Up. II, 5.\n\n[343:2](sbe15118.htm#fr_1167) Cf. _Kh_ and. Up. VIII, 8.\n\n[343:3](sbe15118.htm#fr_1168) I prefer ayatatmana _h_ , though it is the\neasier (sugama) reading, as compared with anyatatmana _h_ , those who seek for\nthe Self elsewhere, namely, in the body. It seems to me to refer to those who,\nwithout having subdued the passions of their body, wish to obtain the\nknowledge of the Highest Self. Possibly, however, the author may have intended\na climax from anyatatmana _h_ to anyatamam.\n\n[344:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1169) This seems to be the meaning adopted by the\ncommentator; but may it not be, sending forth brightness?\n\n[344:2](sbe15118.htm#fr_1170) The simile is not very clear. The light of\nBrahman is below the sphere of fire in the body. That sphere of fire becoming\nheated, the light of Brahman becomes manifest. When the fire has been fanned\nby the wind of sonant breath, then the light of Brahman, embodying itself in\nthe wind and the fire, manifests itself first in the mere sound of Om, but\nafterwards, checked by throat, palate, &c., it assumes the form of articulate\nletters, and ends by becoming the Veda in its many branches.\n\n[344:3](sbe15118.htm#fr_1171) As these are outwardly changed, without losing\ntheir nature, thus the light of Brahman, though assuming the different forms\nof the Veda, remains itself.\n\n[344:4](sbe15118.htm#fr_1172) See before, VII, 1.\n\n[344:5](sbe15118.htm#fr_1173) See B _ri_ h. Up. IV, 2, 2, 3, where Indra is\nexplained as Indha.\n\n[345:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1174) A comparison of this verse with _Kh_ and. Up.\nVII, 26, shows the great freedom with which the wording of these ancient\nverses was treated. Instead of--\n\nNa pasyan m _ri_ tyum pa _s_ yati na roga _m_ nota du _h_ khatam,  \nSarva _m_ hi pa _s_ yan pa _s_ yati sarvam apnoti sarva _s_ a _h_ ,\n\nthe _Kh_ andogya Up. reads:\n\nNa pa _s_ yo m _ri_ tyum pa _s_ yati na roga _m_ nota du _h_ khatam,  \nSarva _m_ ha pa _s_ ya _h_ pa _s_ yati sarvam apnoti sarva _s_ a _h_.\n\n[345:2](sbe15118.htm#fr_1175) The conditions here described are sometimes\ncalled the Vi _s_ va (Vai _s_ vanara), Tai _g_ asa, Pra _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a, and Turiya.\nIn the first state the Self is awake, and enjoys the world; in the second he\nsees everything as in a dream; in the third the two former states cease, and\nhe is absorbed in sleep; in the fourth he becomes again the pure Self. In the\nfirst state the Self has the disguise of a coarse material body; in the second\nof a subtle material body; in the third its disguise is potential only; in the\nfourth it has no disguise, either potential or realised.\n\n[346:1](sbe15118.htm#fr_1176) \'By reason of the experience of the false and\nthe true, the great Soul appears possessed of duality.\' Cowell.\n\n'
