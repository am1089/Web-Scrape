Vyasa said :-- O King! At this moment, the Muni Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, endowed with\nhis power of tapas, came up there, very angry as if the God of Death, to ask\nof his wealth. Seeing him Haris\xc2\x92chandra fallen thus senseless on the ground,\nVis\xc2\x92vamitra, then, began to sprinkle water on his body. O King! The man who is\ninvolved in a debt his troubles increase day by day. So get up and pay your\npromised Dak _s_ i _n_ a. The King, thus sprinkled with water, cold as snow,\nregained his consciousness; but, seeing Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, he fainted again. At\nthis, the Dvija Vis\xc2\x92vamitra consoled him and angrily spoke to him thus :--\n\n\n\n6-10. O King! If you want to maintain your steadiness, give, then my Dak _s_ i\n_n_ a. Look! It is Truth that makes the Sun shine; It is the Truth that has\nstationed this Earth in its position; what to speak more, even the Svarga is\nestablished on Truth; so the greatest Dharma lies in Truth. If the fruit of\nthe thousand As\xc2\x92vamedhas be held in one pan and Truth be held on the other pan\nof the balance, then Truth outweighs the thousand horse sacrifices or what\nneed I to speak all about this! O King! If you fail to give my Dak _s_ i _n_ a\nbefore the Sunset, I will, no doubt, curse you. Saying this, Vis\xc2\x92vamitra went\naway. The King also became very terrified. The wealthless King was pained by\nthe words of the Muni; but he was more troubled with the thought how he would\npay him and keep to Truth.\n\n\n\n11-13. Suta said :-- O Ri _s_ is! At this time, a Brahmi _n_ , skilled in the\nVedas, with many other Brahmi _n_ s, started out of his house, at that very\nplace. The queen, then seeing the Brahmi _n_ ascetic close by, addressed the\nKing in words reasonable and in accordance with the Dharma, O Lord! A Brahmi\n_n_ is considered the father of the other three Var _n_ as (i.e., K _s_\nattriyas, Vais\xc2\x92yas, and S\xc2\x92udras) and a son can certainly take the father\xc2\x92s\nthings; so it is my intention that you beg your wealth from this Brahmi _n_.\n\n\n\n14-18. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O One of thin waist! To beg suits the Brahma _n_ as;\nit is prohibited to the K _s_ attriyas; I being a K _s_ attriya do not wish to\ntake anything as gift. The Brahmi _n_ s are the Gurus of all the Var _n_ as.\nSo they are always to be respected. It is not proper to beg from a Brahmi _n_\n; especially the K _s_ attriyas never ask anything from\n\n\n\np. 665\n\n\n\nthe Brahmi _n_ s; it is totally prohibited. Offering oblations, study, gift\nand the governing of subjects and protecting those that take refuge is the\nDharma of the K _s_ attriyas but they would never, never, ask any other man\n\xc2\x91Give, give,\xc2\x92 and utter these words indicative of humility O Devi! The words\n\xc2\x91I am giving you\xc2\x92 are impressed within my heart; so I will earn money from\nsome other source and give that to the Muni.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n19-20. The Queen said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Time keeps some men in one and the same\nstate; again it throws others into troubles; Time it is that gives respect to\none and again it is Time that gives disrespect to others. Time it is that\nmakes one a donor and it is the same Time that makes another a beggar. So even\nthe Ri _s_ i Vis\xc2\x92vamitra, learned and endowed with the strength of Tapas,\nbecoming angry has deprived you of your kingdom and happiness and has thus\ndone quite an irreligious act in the shape of tormenting others. You can now\njudge in this the wonderful workings of Time.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n21-22. The King said :-- \xc2\x93I would rather out off my tongue into two pieces by\na sharp sword than I would quit my K _s_ attriya pride; and I would never be\nable to utter the words \xc2\x91Give, give.\xc2\x92 O Fortunate One! I am a K _s_ attriya;\nso I never ask anything of anyone. I always say that, by the strength of my\narms, I will earn money and pay off my debt.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n23-27. The Queen said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Indra and the other Devas have given me\nover duly to your hands. So I am your religious (legal) wife; especially I\nhave got education and I ought to be protected. Therefore O Luminous One! If\nyou do not like to beg then you can sell me and pay off your Dak _s_ i _n_ a.\xc2\x94\nThe King Haris\xc2\x92chandra became grieved very much to hear these words and\nlamented, saying, \xc2\x93O What a painful thing is this! What a painful thing is\nthis!\xc2\x94 His wife again spoke :-- \xc2\x93O King! Will we, afterwards, be burnt by the\nfire of curse from a Brahmi _n_ and thus lowered very much? So keep my word\nnow. You are selling me, not because that you are infatuated with desire for\ngambling nor you are deprived of all knowledge by enjoyments in worldly things\nnor you are selling me owing to avert the danger of your kingdom. It is that\nyou are selling me to pay off the debt to your Guru. So nothing sinful a fault\nwill be incurred by you. So sell me and keep to Truth and the fruits thereof.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-First Chapter of the Seventh Book on the description of\nthe sorrows of Haris\xc2\x92chandra in the Maha Pura _n_ am, S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam\nof 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 22](bk07ch22.htm)\n\n"
