He begins with: 'That indeed was the oldest in the worlds 2;'--for that\n(the Brahman) is verily the oldest in the worlds.\n\n2\\. 'Whence was born the fierce one, endowed with brilliant force;'--for from\nit was born the fierce one, who is endowed with brilliant force.\n\n3\\. 'When born he at once destroys the enemies;'--for he at once when born\nstruck down the evil one.\n\n4\\. 'He after whom all friends rejoice;'--verily all friends are the\ncreatures, and they rejoice after him, saying, 'He has risen, he has risen 3.'\n\n5\\. 'Growing by strength, the almighty 4;'--for he (the sun) does grow by\nstrength, the almighty.\n\n6\\. 'He, as enemy, causes fear to the slave;'--for everything is afraid of\nhim.\n\n7\\. 'Taking the breathing and the not-breathing;'--this means the living and\nthe lifeless.\n\n8\\. 'Whatever has been offered at feasts came to thee;'--this means everything\nis in thy power.\n\n9\\. 'All turn their thought also on thee 5;'--this\n\np. 180\n\nmeans all these beings, all minds, all thoughts also turn to thee.\n\n10\\. 'When these two become three protectors;'--i. e. when these two united\nbeget offspring.\n\n11\\. He who knows this, gets offspring and cattle.\n\n12\\. 'Join what is sweeter than sweet (offspring) with the sweet (the\nparents);'--for the couple (father and mother) is sweet, the offspring is\nsweet, and he thus joins the offspring with the couple.\n\n13\\. 'And this (the son, when married) being very sweet, conquered through the\nsweet;'--i. e. the couple is sweet, the offspring is sweet, and thus through\nthe couple he conquers offspring 1.\n\n14\\. This is declared by a _Ri_ shi 2: 'Because he (Pra _g_ apati) raised his\nbody (the hymn tad id asa or the Veda in general) in the body (of the\nsacrificer)' (therefore that Nishkevalya hymn is praised);--i. e. this body,\nconsisting of the Veda, in that corporeal form (of the sacrificer).\n\n15\\. 'Then let this body indeed be the medicine of that body;'--i. e. this\nbody, consisting of the Veda, of that corporeal form (of the sacrificer).\n\n16\\. Of this (the first foot of Rv. X, 120, 1) the eight syllables are\nGayatri, the eleven syllables are Trish _t_ ubh, the twelve syllables are _G_\nagati, the ten syllables are Vira _g_. The Vira _g_ , consisting of ten\nsyllables, rests in these three metres 3.\n\n17\\. The word purusha, consisting of three syllables, that indeed goes into\nthe Vira _g_  4.\n\np. 181\n\n18\\. Verily, these are all metres, these (Gayatri, Trish _t_ ubh, Gagati)\nhaving the Vira _g_ as the fourth. In this manner this day is complete in all\nmetres to him who knows this.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[179:1](sbe01191.htm#fr_436) He now explains the first hymn of the\nNishkevalya, which is called the Ra _g_ ana.\n\n[179:2](sbe01191.htm#fr_437) Rv. X, 120, 1.\n\n[179:3](sbe01191.htm#fr_438) The sun and the fire.\n\n[179:4](sbe01191.htm#fr_439) Rv. X, 120, 2.\n\n[179:5](sbe01191.htm#fr_440) Rv. X, 120, 3.\n\n[180:1](sbe01191.htm#fr_441) All these are purely fanciful interpretations.\n\n[180:2](sbe01191.htm#fr_442) Not to be found in our _S_ akha of the Rig-veda.\n\n[180:3](sbe01191.htm#fr_443) These metres are obtained by a purely arbitrary\ncounting of syllables in the hymn tadidasa, which really consists of Trish _t_\nubh verses.\n\n[180:4](sbe01191.htm#fr_444) If we simply count syllables, the first and\nsecond feet of the p. 181 first verse consist of ten syllables only, the\nfourth of nine or ten. In order to bring them to the right number, the word\npurusha is to be added to what is a Vira _g_ , i.e. to the first, the second,\nand fourth feet. We thus get:\n\ntad id asa bhuvaneshu _g_ yesh _th_ am pu  \nyato _g_ a _g_ \xc3\xb1a ugras tveshan _ri_ m _n_ o ru  \nsadyo ga _g_ \xc3\xb1ano ni ri _n_ ati _s_ atrun  \nanu ya _m_ vi _s_ ve madanti uma _h_ sha _h_.\n\nCf.
