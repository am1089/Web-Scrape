The Upanishads. 1--The earlier Upanishads, a series of philosophic\ntracts of varying length and character, arose in the schools of the Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as,\nand especially were attached to the sections of the latter styled _\xc4\x80\nra\xe1\xb9\x87yakas._ The Hindus class together Vedas, Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as, \xc4\x80ra\xe1\xb9\x87yakas, and\nUpanishads under the general title of "Veda" (knowledge) or "Revelation" ( _\xc5\x9b\nruti,_ "hearing").\n\nThe Vedas and Br\xc4\x81hma\xe1\xb9\x87as are the handbooks of a crude naturalistic ritualism;\nbut the \xc4\x80ra\xe1\xb9\x87yakas ("Forest-books"), apparently intended\n\np. 13\n\nfor the study of anchorites in the woods, where the more elaborate liturgies\nwere suspended, deal more with the theory of ritual, chiefly from an\nallegorical point of view. Hence they lead over to the earlier Upanishads,\nwhich express a series of generally cognate metaphysical and psychological\nideas, at first by allegorical interpretation of Vedic ritual and myth, later\nwith increasing independence of method. Their relation towards Vedic ritualism\nwas at first one of opposition; preaching the saving grace of knowledge alone,\nthey regarded as inadequate the actual liturgies, which admittedly aimed only\nat worldly welfare. Later their attitude became more conciliatory, and we find\nthem styling themselves _Ved \xc4\x81nta_ (first Mu\xe1\xb9\x87\xe1\xb8\x8d. III. ii. 6, \xc5\x9avet. VI. 22).\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[12:1](brk06.htm#fr_0) The etymology of the word _Upanishad_ is not clear.\nEuropean scholars generally regard it as from the root _sad_ (compare Latin\n_sedeo_ ), so that it would mean "a sitting before," i.e. a lesson; but native\ntradition interprets it as "mystery," and the enigmatic formulae in which the\nolder Upanishads sometimes convey their theories lend some support to this\nview (see Deussen, _Philosophy of Upanishads,_ English translation, pp. 10\nff.).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Foundations of Upanishadic Ideas](brk07.htm)\n\n'
