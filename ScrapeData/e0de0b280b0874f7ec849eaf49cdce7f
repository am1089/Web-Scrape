Now there, on the occasion of the entering on the fast, it is said\n2, 'If he does not eat, he becomes\n\np. 21\n\nconsecrated to the Fathers 1; and if he does eat he eats whilst passing over\nthe gods;' and, in this respect, they lay down the rule, 'Let him therefore\neat what grows in the forest.'\n\n11:1:7:22\\. If he eats cultivated plants he eats the sacrificial essence of\nthe offering-cake; and if he eats forest plants he eats the essence of the\nbarhis 2; and if he eats aught of trees he eats the essence of the fuel (for\nthe sacrificial fire); and if he drinks milk he consumes the essence of the\nSannayya 3; and if he drinks water he consumes the essence of the lustral\nwaters 4; and if he eats nothing he becomes consecrated to the Fathers.\n\n11:1:7:33\\. As to this they say, 'What course of procedure is there?' Well,\nlet him, on those two nights (of full and new moon), himself offer the\nAgnihotra: inasmuch as, after offering, he takes food he does not become\nconsecrated to the Fathers, for that (libation) is an offering; and inasmuch\nas he performs that offering in his own self he does not eat of those\nsacrificial essences.\n\n11:1:7:44\\. Now all the nights concentrate themselves in these two nights: all\nthe nights of the waxing moon concentrate in the night of full moon, and all\nthe nights of the waning moon concentrate in the night of new moon; and,\nverily, for him who, knowing this, offers (the Agnihotra) himself on the day\nof\n\np. 22\n\nthe entrance on the fast, offering is always made by himself 1.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[20:2](sbe44009.htm#fr_114) See I, 1, 1, 9. 10.\n\n[21:1](sbe44009.htm#fr_115) That is, he would be liable to die, and join the\ndeparted ancestors.\n\n[21:2](sbe44009.htm#fr_116) The layer of sacrificial grass spread on the Vedi,\nserving as a seat for the deities to whom offering is made.\n\n[21:3](sbe44009.htm#fr_117) For this dish, prepared of sweet and sour milk,\nand offered at the New-moon sacrifice, see part i, p. 178, note 4.\n\n[21:4](sbe44009.htm#fr_118) For the Pra _n_ ita _h_ , see I, 1, 1, 12.\n\n[22:1](sbe44009.htm#fr_119) That is to say, even though on other nights the\nAgnihotra were performed for him by a priest, it would always count as being\nperformed by himself.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XI, 1, 8.
