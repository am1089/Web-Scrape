Naraya _n_ a said :-- O Vipra! In the first beautiful region Atala, the\nexceedingly haughty son of the Danava Maya, named Bala, is living. He has\ncreated the ninety-six Mayas. All the requisites of the inhabitants are\nobtained by them. The other Mayavis know one or\n\n\n\np. 782\n\n\n\ntwo of these. None of them are capable to know all, as they are exceedingly\ndifficult to be carried out. When this powerful Bala yawned, the three classes\nof women were produced, fascinating to all the Lokas. They were named\nPums\xc2\x92chali (or unchaste woman) Svairi _n_ i, (an adultress) and Kamini (a\nlovely women). When any man, beautiful and lovely to them, enters into their\nAtala region, they, with the help of the Ha _t_ aka sentiment (of love),\ngenerate in him, while in solitude, the power to enjoy (copulate) and with\ntheir sweet smiles and amorous lovely looks and with great caution embrace him\nthoroughly and begin to converse with him and with amorous gestures and\npostures, and thus please him well. When the people enjoy this Ha _t_ akarasa,\nthey think often and often, that they themselves have become gods, they have\nbecome Siddhas and powerful like Ayuta elephants; being blind with vanity and\nfinding them endowed with powers and prosperity, they think themselves so\nrepeatedly and constantly. O Narada! Thus the position in Atala has been\ndescribed. Now hear, the description of the second region Vitala. Vitala is\nsituated below the earth. There the Bhagavan Bhava, worshipped by all the\nDevas, has assumed the name of Ha _t_ akes\xc2\x92vara and is staying there coupled\nwith Bhavani, surrounded by His attendants specially for the increase of the\ncreation of Brahma. The river Ha _t_ aki flows there and has Her origin from\nthe essences (Semen virile) of them both. Fire, augmented by the help of the\nwind, begins to drink it. When the Fire leaves that, making a Phutkara noise\n(i.e., blowing out air through the mouth), the gold, named Ha _t_ aka, is\ncreated. This gold is very much liked by the Daityas. The Daitya women use\nthis gold always for their ornaments. Below Vitala is Sutala. It is reckoned\nas of some special importance. O Muni! The highly meritorious Bali, the son of\nVirochana lives here. The Bhagavan Vasudeva, brought down this Bali into\nSutala, for the welfare of Indra. He assumed the body of Trivikrama and gave\nto Bali all the wealth of the three Lokas, all the Lak _s_ mi went to him and\ninstalled him in the position of the Lord of the Daityas. What more can be\nsaid than this, that what prosperity, wealth and riches that Indra could not\nobtain, that S\xc2\x92ri Lak _s_ mi Devi Herself has followed Bali. Bali, as the Lord\nof Sutala, has become entirely fearless, remains here upto this day and is\nworshipping Vasudeva. O Narada! It is said by the high-minded persons that\nwhen Vasudeva Himself, the Controller of all, appeared as a beggar, Bali gave\nhim land, and, therefore, on account of making gift to a good person, he\nacquired so much prosperity. But this cannot be reasonable. For, it is not at\nall reasonable to cast the effects of making this gift on Naraya _n_ a, O\nNarada! Who is Self-manifest by His own Extraordinary\n\n\n\np. 783\n\n\n\nGlory and Who is Himself filled with all Ais\xc2\x92varya (prosperity) and Who can\nbestow the Highest Goal of life and other requirements of men. This Naraya _n_\na is the Deva of the Devas; if anybody takes His name, when in the greatest\ndistress, he gets himself immediately freed from the Gu _n_ as, the cause of\nbondage due to his Karma. All persons perform many Yogas and follow the paths\nadvised by the Samkhya method, with their minds directed to the All-Controller\nBhagavan, to abandon all sorts of troubles and miseries. O Narada! Know that\nthe Bhagavan does not shew us His Favour when he gives us greatest wealth and\nprosperity. For the wealth and riches are the offspring of Maya and the source\nof all worries, miseries and mental troubles; and one is liable to forget the\nBhagavan when one gets such a wealth. The Bhagavan is pervading all this\nuniverse and is full of wisdom; and He is seeing always all the ways and\nmeans; He took away, in the way of begging, rather cheated all that Bali had,\nleaving only his body; and at last, finding no other means, fastened him by\nthe Varu _n_ a Pas\xc2\x92a (noose), threw him in the middle of the mountain cleft\n(cave) and then has stationed Himself at his door as a Door-keeper. Once, out\nof his extreme devotion, Bali did not care at all for his difficulties,\ntroubles, or miseries. Rather he gave out that Indra, whose minister is\nBrihaspati had acted very foolishly. For when the Bhagavan becomes very\ngraciously pleased, he wanted from Him ordinary wealth. But what will the\nwealth of the Trilokas avail? It is a quite insignificant thing. Surely, He is\nan illiterate and stupid brute who, for mere wealth, leaves the Bhagavan, Who\nis the Fountain of all Good Wishes to the Humanity. My grandfather Prahlada,\nwho was highly fortunate, who was devoted to the God and who was always ready\nto do good to others, he did not ask for any other thing than the servantship\nof God (the Dasya Bhava). When his powerful father died, the Bhagavan wanted\nto give him unbounded wealth; but the Bhagavata (devoted) Prahlada did not\nwant that. None of us, who are marked with so many deficiencies can know the\nnature of the Bhagavan Vasudeva, Whose omnipotence cannot be compared and all\nthese manifested worlds are but His Upadhis (adjuncts, limitations). O Devar\n_s_ i! Thus Bali, the Lord of Daityas, the highly respected and renowned in\nall the Lokas, is reigning in Sutala. Hari Himself is his Door-keeper. Once\nthe King Rava _n_ a, the source of torment to all the people, went out to\nconquer the whole world; and when he entered Sutala, that Hari, ever ready to\nshow Grace to His devoted, threw him at a distance of one Ayuta Yoyanas by the\ntoe of His foot. Thus by the grace of the Devadeva Vasudeva, Bali is reigning\nin Sutala, and enjoying all sorts of pleasures, without any equal anywhere.\n\n\n\np. 784\n\n\n\nHere ends the Nineteenth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the narrative of the\nAtala, etc., the Patalas in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Maha Pura _n_ am, of\n18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 20](bk08ch20.htm)\n\n'
