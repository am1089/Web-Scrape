He begins with tad, this, (the first word of the first hymn, tad id asa).\nVerily 'this, this' is food, and thus he obtains food.\n\n2\\. Pra _g_ apati indeed uttered this as the first word, consisting of one or\ntwo syllables, viz. tata and tata (or tat) 1. And thus does a child, as soon\nas he begins to speak, utter the word, consisting of one or two syllables,\nviz. tata and tata (or tat). With this very word, consisting of tat or tatta,\nhe begins.\n\n3\\. This has been said by a _Ri_ shi (Rv. X, 71, 1) 2:--\n\n4\\. 'O B _ri_ haspati, the first point of speech;'--for this is the first and\nhighest point of speech.\n\n5\\. 'That which you have uttered, making it a name;'--for names are made by\nspeech.\n\np. 179\n\n6\\. 'That (name) which was the best and without a flaw;'--for this is the best\nand without a flaw.\n\n7\\. 'That which was hidden by their love, is made manifest;'--for this was\nhidden in the body, viz. those deities (which enter the body, Agni as voice,\nentering the mouth, &c.); and that was manifest among the gods in heaven. This\nis what was intended by the verse.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[178:1](sbe01190.htm#fr_434) Tata and tata are used both by children in\naddressing their parents, and by parents in addressing their children. If tat\nis called the very same word, eva is used in the sense of iva.\n\n[178:2](sbe01190.htm#fr_435) The verse is cited to confirm the meaning of tat,\nthe first word of the first hymn (tad id asa), as explained before. It was\nsaid that tat was the first name applied to a child. Now, according to \xc3\x82 _s_\nvalayana G _ri_ hya-sutra I, 16, 8, a name is given to a child at the time of\nits birth, a name which no one knows except father and mother, till the time\nwhen he is initiated by a Guru. This is called the abhivadaniya name. In\nallusion to this custom it is said here that tata is the secret name of the\nchild, which becomes publicly known at a later time only. Of course the\ninterpretation of the verse in that sense is unnatural, but quite in keeping\nwith the general character of the \xc3\x82ra _n_ yaka. I doubt whether even the\ncommentator understood what was intended by the author, and whether the gods\nwho enter the body are supposed to know the name, or whether the name refers\nto these gods, or, it may be, to tad, the Brahman.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 3, 4](sbe01191.htm)\n\n"
