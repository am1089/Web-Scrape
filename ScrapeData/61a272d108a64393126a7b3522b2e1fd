Man also\nconsists of twenty-one. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his\nfeet, and the trunk the twenty-first. He adorns that trunk, the twenty-first,\nby this hymn 1.\n\n21\\.

He adorns that trunk, the twenty-fifth, by\nthis hymn'.\n\nNow this day consists of twenty-five, and the Stoma hymn of that day consists\nof twenty-five: it becomes the same through the same. Therefore these two, the\nday and the hymn, are twenty-five, yea, twenty-five.\n\np. 166\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[163:2](sbe01183.htm#fr_396) Next follows a list of the verses which form the\nseven t _ri_ _k_ as (groups of three verses) of the Pra-uga hymn, with\noccasional remarks on certain words.\n\n[165:1](sbe01183.htm#fr_397) Cf.
