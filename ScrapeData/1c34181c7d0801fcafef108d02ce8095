Suta said :-- The King Haris\xc2\x92chandra with his face bent low thus said to\nthe Queen :-- \xc2\x93O Young One! I am a great sinner, otherwise why shall I be\nready to do this heinous act! However now sit before me. If my hand be capable\nto kill you, then it will cut off your head.\xc2\x94 Thus saying, the King took the\naxe and moved forward to cut her. As the King did not recognise her as His\nQueen, so the Queen did not recognise him as Her husband, the King. So the\nQueen, being very much strained with sorrow, began to utter with a view to\ncourt her death.\n\n\n\n4-16. O Cha _nd_ ala! If you like, I say something; hear my son is dead and is\nlying close to the outer skirts of the city. Wait till I bring my child before\nyou and do his burning ceremonies. Next you can cut me off by your axe. The\nKing said :-- \xc2\x93Very well; let that be,\xc2\x94 and gave her permission to go to her\ndead son. Then the Queen, emaciated and pale, her body being covered all over\nwith dust arrived at the burning ground and taking her dead son, bitten by a\nserpent, on her lap cried out loudly \xc2\x93O Son! O my Child! O my young Son!\xc2\x94 and\nreferring to her husband said :-- \xc2\x93O King! See, today, the sad condition of\nyour son, lying on the ground, as his bed. My son went to play with other boys\nand, bitten by a cruel poisonous serpent, left his life.\xc2\x94 Hearing the pitiful\ncry of that helpless woman, the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra went to the dead and took\noff the cover of his face. Due to the long exile and the difficulties thereof,\nthe Queen was changed altogether in her outer form, so the King could not\nrecognise her weeping as his wife. On the other hand the King, too, had not\nthe curled hair on his head as before; it has turned into matted hair and his\nskin especially has become like the bark of a dried tree; so the Queen could\nnot make out the King also. The King then noticed all the King making\nauspicious signs on the several limbs of that dead boy, poisoned all over and\nlying on the ground and began to think thus :-- The face of the child is very\nbeautiful like the Full Moon, nowhere there is any scar nor anything like\nthis; the nose is high; the two cheeks are clean like a mirror and spacious;\nthe hairs are blue, curling, similar, long and waving, the two eyes are widely\nexpanded like a full blown lotus, the two lips are red like Bimba fruits; the\nchest is wide and spacious, the eyes are stretched up to the ears; the arms\nare extending up to the knees; the shoulders are\n\n\n\np. 681\n\n\n\nelevated; the legs are elongated, yet god-like like a lotus stem; the\nappearance is grave, the fingers are fine, yet strong enough to hold the\nworld; the navel is deep and the region of the shoulders elevated. Certainly\nthis boy was born in a royal family. Alas! What a pain is this! The cruel\nDeath has reduced him to this state!\n\n\n\n17-21. Suta said :-- Thus looking carefully that boy in the lap of his mother\nfrom his head to foot, the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra got back to his ancient\nrecollections. He recognised the boy to be his and wept aloud repeating the\nwords Oh! Oh! The tears flowed from his eyes and he said :-- \xc2\x93This is my boy\nthat has been reduced to this state! Oh! The cruel Fate!\xc2\x94 Though the boy is\ndead, yet the King remained bewildered for a moment. The queen then spoke out\nof terrible pain :-- \xc2\x93O Child! What sin is that which has caused this dire\ncalamity, I cannot imagine!\n\n\n\n22-27. O my Husband! O King! I am extremely worried of pains and troubles;\nleaving me thus, how is it and where you are passing away your time in a calm,\nquiet state! O Fortune! It is You that has brought about the loss of the Rajar\n_s_ i Haris\xc2\x92chandra\xc2\x92s dominion, the separation from his friends and what more,\nyou have caused his wife and son to be sold! Has he done so much mischief to\nyou!\xc2\x94 Hearing her cries, the King\xc2\x92s patience gave way and he came to recognise\nthe Devi and the son and exclaimed, \xc2\x93She is my wife and the dead boy is my\nson. Oh! What a series of troubles, one coming after another.\xc2\x94 Being\noverpowered with extreme trouble and pain, the King fell unconscious on the\nground; the Queen, too, looking at the King\xc2\x92s state, fell motionless, and,\nvoid of senses, no sooner she recognised him as the King Haris\xc2\x92chandra. Some\ntime after, the King and Queen both got back at the same time their\nconsciousness and, with great sorrow and agony, began to lament.\n\n\n\n28-49. The King said :--\xc2\x93O Child! Why my heart does not rend to thousand\npieces, seeing today your gentle face pale and lifeless, that was once\nbeautiful with curls of hairs! O Rohita! When will you come to me saying in a\nsweet voice, \xc2\x91Father! Father!\xc2\x92 When shall I address you affectionately, \xc2\x91Oh my\nchild! Oh my child!\xc2\x92 embracing you within my breast! Whose tawny coloured dust\non his knees will spoil my clothes, lap and my body! O Delightful Son! I have\nsold you as if an ordinary thing, though I am your father. As yet my pleasure\nof having a son is not satisfied. Owing to the mockery of the mean Fate, my\nunbounded kingdom, friends, and abundance of riches all have vanished away!\nFinally I had one son and that too is now in the jaws of death! Oh! With what\nan amount of terrible pain I am being burnt up today when I am seeing the\nlotus-face of my son, smitten by a serpent and\n\n\n\np. 682\n\n\n\nlying dead on the ground!\xc2\x94 Thus speaking in a voice choked with feelings and\nwith tears in his eyes, as soon as he was going to take his boy in his lap, he\nfell senseless on the ground. Seeing the King lying on the ground, S\xc2\x92aivya\nthus thought :-- \xc2\x93Such is His voice as makes me certain that He is the King\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra, the best of men and the delighter of the learned men\xc2\x92s hearts.\nHis teeth are like those of the famous Haris\xc2\x92chandra just like to Mukul and\nhis nose is elevated and soft like the Tila flower. But if he be\nHaris\xc2\x92chandra, how is it that he has come to this burning ground!\xc2\x94 Thus\nthinking, while she looked at the King, leaving for the moment the sorrow for\nhis son, joy, pain and surprise attacked her heart simultaneously; and she, in\nthat state, fell down unconscious on the ground. Then gradually regaining\nconsciousness, she spoke in a pitiful voice :-- \xc2\x93O Fortune! You have caused to\nthe King who was once like an Immortal, the loss of his kingdom, friends, and\neven the sale of his wife and son. And now you have transformed him into a Cha\n_nd_ ala! You are merciless, religionless, void of any justice as to what is\njust and what is unjust. You are shameless. So fie on you! O King! Where are\ngone today that royal umbrella, that throne, that Chamara, and that pair of\nfans on your both sides! Oh! What is this transformation caused by the Vidhata\n(the Ordainer of Fate)! When the high-souled King used to travel, all the\nkings used to remove as His servants the dust of the roads by their clothings!\nOh! Is He the same King of Kings, Haris\xc2\x92chandra who is roaming in this unholy\nburning ground, burdened too much by his load of sufferings! Oh! Innumerable\nhuman skulls are lying here; the small earthen pots (brought for the\npurification of the bodies of the dead) are lying scattered close to each; the\ngarlands of flowers for the dead, being intertwined with the hairs of the\ndead, are presenting a grim spectacle! The ashes, charcoals, half-burnt dead\nbodies, bones, and marrows all arranged one over another make the place more\nhideous. The marrows of the dead bodies have come out and are dried up by the\nsun. At places, vultures, and S\xc2\x92akunis are crying hideously and the crows and\nother birds, eager to eat flesh, are roaming to and fro. All the quarters of\nthe sky are looking blue with the smoke, arising out of the burning of the\ndead. The Rak _s_ asas are constantly roaming hither and thither, gladly\nfeasting on the human flesh. Is the King passing his days thus in this place?\nAlas! Oh! What a painful thing is this!\xc2\x94 The daughter of the King, S\xc2\x92aivya,\nwas overpowered with an awful sorrow; and clasping the neck of the King, began\nto lament again, in a pitiful voice. O King! You have spoken that you are a\nCha _nd_ ala. Is this a dream? Or a Reality? O King! If it be true that you\nare a slave of the Cha _nd_ ala, then say to me; my mind is being deluded very\nmuch! (i.e., I cannot\n\n\n\np. 683\n\n\n\nindulge this idea). O Knower of Dharma! You have shown your great zeal towards\nDharma; and, for that reason, you are displaced from your royal throne! Now if\nsuch help comes out of worshipping the Brahmi _n_ s and the Devas, then Dharma\ncannot stand and, along with it, the truth, simplicity and harmlessness cannot\nexist.\n\n\n\n50-55. Suta said :-- Hearing these words from the thin S\xc2\x92aivya, the King took\na heavy sigh and then described to her in detail with tears flowing on his\nneck, how he got the Cha _nd_ ala state. The fearful Queen became very much\npained to hear all this and heaving a deep sigh, described, as it was, how her\nson died. On hearing this, the King fainted and fell unconscious on the\nground. Then regaining gradually his consciousness, he began to kiss, with his\ntongue, the face of his dead son. S\xc2\x92aivya then said in a choked voice :-- \xc2\x93Now\nsever off my head and obey your master\xc2\x92s word. O King! You will be saved then\nas having kept your truth; and your master\xc2\x92s order would be carried out.\xc2\x94\nHearing this, the King fainted and fell down senseless. Getting up conscious\nin a moment, he began to weep bitterly.\n\n\n\n56\\. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Beloved! How have you uttered such cruel words? How\ncan I execute that which is hard even to utter!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n57-58. S\xc2\x92aivya said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord! I have worshipped the Devi Gauri and other\nDevas and the Brahmi _n_ s; so, with their mercy, I will get you as my husband\nin my future birth.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, the King again fell down instantly on the\nground; getting up immediately, he was overpowered with sorrow and began to\nkiss the face of the dead son.\n\n\n\n59-71. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Dear! I won\xc2\x92t be able to suffer an longer for a\nlong time. But, O thin-bodied One! See, I am so very unfortunate that I have\nno command even over my heart. If I enter into the fire without the permission\nof the Cha _nd_ ala, then I will have to become again the slave of a Cha _nd_\nala in my future birth. Think it over. After that I will have to go to the\nhell and be tormented there. But this too I find beneficial to me. Rather I\nwill go to the hell Maha Raurava and there suffer for a long time the torments\nof the hell, yet I do not like to live a little longer when my boy, the\ncontinuer of my family, has left his life out of the queer fancies of the\nGreat Time and I be merged in the sorrows for my son. My body is now at the\ncommand of the Cha _nd_ ala. How can I in this state quit my life without his\npermission. If I leave my body, I will be indebted to him and I will have to\nsuffer in hell. Let this be so; still I will leave off my body, the receptacle\nof all these pains and troubles. Nowhere, in the Triloki, is any pain like\n\n\n\np. 684\n\n\n\nthat felt in the demise of a son, not in crossing the Vaitara _n_ i nor in the\nAsipatravanam! So I will now throw myself on the burning fire along with the\ndead body of my son. So, O Thin-bodied One! You should now excuse me (i.e., do\nnot prevent me). O Sweet-smiling One! I now permit you to go back to the house\nof the Brahmi _n_. If ever I have given in charity riches, offered oblation to\nthe fire, and given satisfaction to my superiors then, in the other world, I\nwill get you and my son. But there is no such chance now in this world. O\nSweet-smiling One! If ever I had given you offence while conversing or making\njokes with you, now at the time of my parting, excuse them all. O Auspicious\nOne! Never despise the Brahmi _n_ out of your pride as a Queen. Look on your\nmaster as a Deva and try all your best to satisfy him.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n72-73. The Queen said :-- \xc2\x93O Rajar _s_ i! I will also throw myself on the\nburning fire. O Deva! I will not be able to carry on this burden, so I will\naccompany You. It is better for me to accompany you; so there will not be\notherwise. O Giver of Honour! I will enjoy with You heaven or suffer with You\nin the hell.\xc2\x94 Hearing this, the King said :-- \xc2\x93O Chaste One! Do as you\nplease.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\nHere ends the Twenty-sixth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the narration of the\nsorrows of Haris\xc2\x92chandra in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, of\n18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 27](bk07ch27.htm)\n\n"
