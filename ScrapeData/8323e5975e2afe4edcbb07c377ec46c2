The joy-giving Hot _ri_ has taken his place at the sacrifices\n[1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:1:1), He the true, the sacrificer, the highest sage,\nthe worshipper. Agni whose chariot is lightning, the son of strength, whose\nhair is flame, has spread forth his light over the earth.\n\n2\\. It [1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:2:1) has been offered to thee--be pleased with\nthe adoring speech [2](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:2:2)--to thee who is observant of\nit, O righteous, strong one. Bring hither thou who art wise, the wise (gods).\nSit down on the sacrificial grass in the middle (of it) for bliss, O\nworshipful one!\n\n3\\. To thee, Agni, Night and Dawn who further thy strength\n[1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:3:1), shall hasten on the paths of the wind. When\n(the mortals) anoint the ancient one [2](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:3:2) with\nofferings, they [3](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:3:3) stand in the house as on a\nchariot-seat [4](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:3:4).\n\n4\\. Mitra and Varu _n_ a, O strong Agni, and all the Maruts shall sing to thee\na pleasant song, when thou, O son of strength, standest with thy flames, a sun\nspreading out men [1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:4:1) over the (terrestrial)\ndwellings.\n\n5\\. We have given thee thy desire to-day, sitting down near thee adoringly\nwith outstretched hands [1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:5:1): sacrifice thou to the\ngods as a priest with thy mind most skilled in sacrifice, with unerring\nthoughts, O Agni!\n\n6\\. From thee indeed, O son of strength, proceed manifold divine blessings and\ngains [1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:6:1). Give us thousandfold true wealth\naccording to thy guileless word, O Agni!\n\np. 269\n\n7\\. What we have done here for thee at this sacrifice, we mortals, O skilful\nand thoughtful god, take thou notice of all that, O (god) with the good\nchariot [1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:7:1); make all this (sacrificial food) here\nsavoury, immortal Agni!\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe same _Ri_ shi. The metre is Trish _t_ ubh.--Verse 5 = VS. XVIII, 75.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. On vidatha, comp. I, 31, 6, note 2.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. The subject to be supplied seems to be nama _h_ -ukti _h_.\n\nNote 2. The words nama _h_ -uktim _g_ ushasva form a parenthesis, as Ludwig\nhas seen.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. It is possible that here, as in several other passages, a confusion\nbetween the two verbs va _g_ ayati and va _g_ ayati has taken place. If the\nreading were va _g_ ayanti, we should have to translate, 'Night and Dawn who\nare striving together (as if running a race against each other?).'\n\nNote 2. The ancient one is Agni.\n\nNote 3. The two goddesses, Night and Dawn.\n\nNote 4. The Padapa _th_ a has vandhura-iva, which may be the dual of vandhur\n(I, 34, 9). But more probably it should be vandhure-iva (nom. dual, neuter or\nloc. sing.), comp. I, 64, 9. a\xc2\xb4 vandhureshu \xe2\x80\xa6 tasthau; I, 139, 4. adhi vam\nstha\xc2\xb4ma vandhure; III, 43, 1. vandhuresh _th_ a\xc2\xb4 _h_ , and see III, 6, 10.\nadhvareva. On contracted Prag _ri_ hya vowels, see H. O., Die Hymnen des Rig-\nveda, I, p. 456.\n\np. 270\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. On n _r i\xc2\xb4_n and the different theories proposed for this word, see\nabove, I, 146, 4, note 5.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. Comp. X, 79, 2. uttanahasta _h_.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. For this hemistich, comp. VI, 13, 1; 34, 1.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. The traditional text has tvam vi _s_ vasya surathasya bodhi, which can\nonly mean, 'take thou notice of every one who has a good chariot'--which\nBergaigne (Quelques observations sur les figures de rhetorique dans le Rig-\nveda, p. 15) explains: 'Le char en question est la priere qui amene le dieu au\nsacrifice.' I believe that the text is corrupt; instead of surathasya I think\nwe should read surathasya (= suratha asya).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 15](sbe46075.htm)\n\n"
