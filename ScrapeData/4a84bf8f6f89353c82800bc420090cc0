At the midday Soma-feast he consecrates (the Sacrificer) by\nsprinkling; and at the midday Soma-feast they run a race; for, verily, Pra _g_\napati is that sacrifice 1 which is here performed, and from which these\ncreatures have been produced,--and indeed, they are even now produced after\nthis one: thus he thereby wins Pra _g_ apati in the very centre (of the\nsacrifice).\n\n5:1:4:22\\. The Mahendra cup being not yet drawn,--for\n\np. 18\n\nthat, the Mahendra, is Indra\'s special (nishkevalya) cup, and so also are his\nthat Nishkevalya-stotra and Nishkevalya- _s_ astra; and the Sacrificer is\nIndra: thus he consecrates him at his own dwelling-place. Hence, the Mahendra\ncup being not yet drawn,--\n\n5:1:4:33\\. He takes down the chariot 1, with (Va _g_. S. IX, 5), \'Thou art\nIndra\'s thunderbolt;\' for the chariot is indeed a thunderbolt, and the\nsacrificer is Indra: therefore he says, \'Thou art Indra\'s thunderbolt;\'--\'a\nwinner of wealth,\' for the chariot is indeed a winner of wealth;--\'May this\none win wealth by thee!\'--wealth means food: \'may this one gain food by thee,\'\nis what he thereby says.\n\n5:1:4:44\\. That chariot, seized by the pole, he turns (from left to right) so\nas to make it stand inside the vedi 2, with, \'In the winning of wealth, the\ngreat Mother\'--wealth means food: \'in the winning of food, the great Mother\'--\nis what he thereby says;--\'Aditi by name, we praise with speech;\' now Aditi is\nthis earth: therefore he says, \'Aditi by name, we praise with\nspeech,\'--\'whereon all this being hath settled;\' for indeed thereon all being\nhere is settled;--\'thereon may the divine Savit _ri_ prosper our stay!\'\nwhereby he means to say, \'thereon may the divine Savit _ri_ prosper our\nSacrificer!\'\n\n5:1:4:55\\. He then sprinkles the horses with water, either when being led down\nto be watered, or when brought\n\np. 19\n\nup after being watered. Now in the beginning the horse was produced from the\nwater; while being produced from the water, it was produced incomplete, for it\nwas indeed produced incomplete: hence it does not stand on all its feet, but\nit stands lifting one foot on each side. Thus what then was left behind of it\nin the water, therewith he now completes it, and makes it whole: therefore he\nsprinkles the horses with water, either when being led down to be watered, or\nwhen brought up after being watered.\n\n5:1:4:66\\. He sprinkles them, with (Va _g_. S. .IX, 6), \'Within the waters is\nambrosia, in the waters is medicine: at the praises of the waters may ye wax\nstrong, ye horses!\' And with this also, \'O divine waters, what rushing, high-\npeaked, wealth-winning wave ye have, therewith may this one win wealth!\'\nwealth is food: he thus says, \'May he thereby gain food!\'\n\n5:1:4:77\\. He then yokes (the team of) the chariot. The right horse he yokes\n(puts to) first; for in human (practice) they indeed put to the left horse\nfirst, but with the gods in this way.\n\n5:1:4:88\\. He yokes it, with (Va _g_. S. IX, 7), Either the wind, or\nthought--\'for there is nothing swifter than the wind, and nothing swifter than\nthought:\' therefore he says, \'Either the wind, or thought;--\'(or) the seven\nand twenty Gandharvas 1,\n\np. 20\n\nthey yoked the horse at first;\' for the Gandharvas indeed yoked the horse at\nfirst: \'May they who yoked the horse at first yoke thee!\' this he thereby says\nthey;--\'laid speed into him,\'--he thereby says, \'May they who laid speed into\nit, lay speed into thee!\'\n\n5:1:4:99\\. He then yokes the left horse, with (Va _g_. S. IX, 8), \'Become thou\nswift as the wind, O courser, being yoked!\'--thereby he says, \'Become quick as\nthe wind, O courser, being yoked;\'--\'be thou as Indra\'s right (steed) in\nbeauty!\'--he thereby says, \'Even as Indra\'s right (steed) for beauty, so be\nthou that of the sacrificer for beauty!\'--\'May the all-knowing Maruts yoke\nthee!\' he thereby says, \'may gods yoke thee!\'--\'May Tvash _t_ _ri_ lay speed\ninto thy feet!\' in this there is nothing obscure. He then yokes the right\nside-horse; for in human (practice) they indeed yoke the left side-horse\nfirst, but with the gods in this way.\n\n5:1:4:1010\\. He yokes it, with (Va _g_. S. IX, 9), \'What speed hath been\nsecretly laid into thee, O courser, and what (speed), bestowed on the eagle,\nwent along in the wind;\'--he thereby says, \'what speed of thine, O courser, is\nhidden away even elsewhere, therewith win this our sacrifice, Pra _g_\napati!\'--\'with that strength be thou strong and wealth-winning for us, O\ncourser, and victorious at the gathering!\'--wealth means food: he thus means\nto say, \'And be thou a food-winner for us at this our\n\np. 21\n\nsacrifice, at the gathering of the gods win thou this sacrifice, Pra _g_\napati!\'\n\n5:1:4:1111\\. Now only those three (horses) are yoked, for what is threefold\nbelongs to the gods, and this (sacrifice is) with the gods. Alongside the yoke\n(laid) on the side-horse 1 goes a fourth (horse), for that one is human. When\nhe is about to give that (chariot to the Adhvaryu), he gives it after yoking\nthe fourth (horse) thereto. Hence also at any other sacrifice only those three\n(horses) are yoked; for what is threefold belongs to the gods, and this\n(sacrifice is) with the gods. Alongside the yoke of the side-horse goes a\nfourth (horse), for that one is human. When he is about to give that (chariot)\naway, he gives it after yoking the fourth (horse) thereto.\n\n5:1:4:1212\\. He now takes out material for a wild-rice pap of seventeen plates\nfor B _ri_ haspati; for he who offers the Va _g_ apeya wins food,--va _g_\na-peya being doubtless the same as anna-peya (food and drink): thus whatever\nfood he has thereby won, that he now prepares for him.\n\n5:1:4:1313\\. And as to why it belongs to B _ri_ haspati:--B _ri_ haspati won\nit in the beginning, therefore it belongs to B _ri_ haspati.\n\n5:1:4:1414\\. And why it is prepared of wild rice:--B _ri_ haspati is the\nBrahman (priesthood), and those wild-rice grains are cooked with the Brahman\n(prayer),--therefore it is of wild rice. It is one of seventeen plates,\n\np. 22\n\nbecause Pra _g_ apati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pra _g_ apati.\n\n5:1:4:1515\\. He makes the horses smell it, with \'Ye coursers--;\' for horses\nare coursers (va _g_ in): therefore he says, \'Ye coursers,\'--\'wealth-winners,\'\n--wealth is food: \'food-winners\' he thereby says;--\'starting upon the course;\'\nfor they are about to run a race;--\'smell ye B _ri_ haspati\'s portion!\' for\nthis indeed is B _ri_ haspati\'s portion: therefore he says, \'smell ye B _ri_\nhaspati\'s portion!\' And why he makes the horses smell it: he thinks, \'may I\nwin Him 1!\' therefore he makes the horses smell it.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[17:1](sbe4106.htm#fr_58) In the original, \'pra _g_ apati _h_ \' is the\npredicate, not the subject, of the sentence; but considerations of\nconstruction seem to render the change desirable in English.\n\n[18:1](sbe4106.htm#fr_59) The Adhvaryu takes it down from the vahana, or car-\nstand.\n\n[18:2](sbe4106.htm#fr_60) It is to be placed in the north-eastern part of the\nvedi, so as to be ready to start on the race northwards along the space\nbetween the _k_ atvala (or pit) and the utkara (heap of rubbish); the horses\nthus being close to where the Brahman will have to mount a cartwheel put up on\nthe utkara ([V, 1, 5, 2](sbe4107.htm#5:1:5:2)).\n\n[19:1](sbe4106.htm#fr_61) Professor Weber (in his essay on the Nakshatras, II,\n278; Abhandl. of Berlin Academy, 1861) takes this passage (--Taitt. S. 1, 7,\n7, 2; Ka _th_ aka 13, 14; Maitr. S. I, 11, 1) to contain the first allusion to\nthe system of Nakshatras, or lunar mansions marking the daily stations\noccupied by the moon (masc.) during his circuit round the heavens.--In the\nritual of the Black Ya _g_ us (Taitt. S. 1, 7, 7, 2) p. 20 this formula runs\nthus: \'Either Vayu, or Manu, or the Gandharvas, the twenty-seven, harnessed\nthe horse at first, laid speed into him,\'--which Saya _n_ a, however,\ninterprets as meaning, \'Vayu, and Manu, and the (twenty-five) Gandharvas,--\nthese seven and twenty. &c.\'\n\n[21:1](sbe4106.htm#fr_62) Or, of the leader, as would appear from Saya _n_ a\nto Taitt. S. I, 7, 8 (p. 1024),--\'Between the right-hand and the left-hand\nhorse he allows the shafts to project, and between them he puts the horse\ncalled "sapti" (in the text)\' No fourth horse is, however, apparently\nmentioned in the ritual of the Black Ya _g_ us.\n\n[22:1](sbe4106.htm#fr_63) That is, B _ri_ haspati; unless \'lokam\' has to be\nsupplied to \'imam\' (\'this world\'), as might appear probable from the next\nparagraph. See also [V. 1, 5,\n27](sbe4107.htm#5:1:5:27)-[28](sbe4107.htm#5:1:5:28).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 1, 5. Fifth Brahma _n_ a](sbe4107.htm)\n\n'
