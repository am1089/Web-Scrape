 \nThe prince whose merits grew, acquired  \n\np. 210  \n\nBy rites performed as he desired,  \nWould now a store of merit gain  \nBought by his body's toil and pain.  \nThose limbs to which pure sandal lent  \nThe freshness of its fragrant scent,  \nExposed to sun. and dust, and rain,  \nAre now defiled with many a stain.  \nAnd I the wretched cause why this  \nFalls on the prince whose right is bliss!  \nAh me, that ever I was born  \nTo be the people's hate and scorn!'  \n   Thus Bharat cried: of anguish sprung,  \nGreat drops upon his forehead hung.  \nHe fell o'erpowered-his grief was such-  \nEre he is brother's feet could touch.  \nAs on the glorious prince he gazed  \nIn vain his broken voice he raised:  \n'Dear lord'--through tears and sobbing came,  \nThe only words his lips could frame.  \nAnd brave Satrughna wept aloud,  \nAs low at Rama's feet he bowed.  \nThen Rama, while his tears ran fast,  \nHis arms around his brothers cast.  \nGuha, Sumantra came to meet  \nThe princes in their wild retreat.  \n   Vrihaspati and Sukra bright  \n     Their greeting thus rejoice to pay  \n   To the dear Lord who brings the night,  \n     And the great God who rules the day.  \n   Then wept the dwellers of the shade,  \n     Whose eyes the princes, meet to ride  \n   On mighty elephants, surveyed;  \n     And cast all thought of joy aside.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[209:1](ry178.htm#fr_377) The rainbow is called the bow of Indra.\n\n[209:2](ry178.htm#fr_378) Bhogavati, the abode of the Nagas or Serpent race.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto CI.: Bharat Questioned.](ry179.htm)\n\n"
