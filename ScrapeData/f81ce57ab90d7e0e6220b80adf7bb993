When he (the slaughterer) announces, \'The victim has been quieted!\'\nthe Adhvaryu says, \'Nesh _t_ ar, lead up the lady!\' The Nesh _t_ _ri_ leads up\nthe (sacrificer\'s) wife bearing a vessel of water for washing the feet.\n\n3:8:2:22\\. He makes her say (Vag . S. VI, 12), \'Homage be to thee, O wide-\nstretched!\'--the wide-stretched one, forsooth, is the sacrifice; for they\nstretch the sacrifice (over the sacrificial ground):\n\np. 191\n\nhence the wide-stretched one is the sacrifice. But that wife, forsooth, is the\nhind-part of the sacrifice, and he wants her, thus coming forward, to\npropitiate the sacrifice. Thereby, then, she makes amends to that sacrifice,\nand thus that sacrifice does not injure her: therefore she says, \'Homage be to\nthee, O wide-stretched!\'\n\n3:8:2:33\\. \'Advance, unresisted!\' whereby she means to say, \'Advance on (a\nway) free from injury!\' \'Unto the rivers of ghee, along the paths of sacred\ntruth!\' whereby she means to say, \'Unto good.\' [Va _g_. S. VI, 13], \'Ye\ndivine, pure waters, carry ye (the sacrifice) to the gods, well-prepared! May\nwe be well-prepared preparers!\' Thereby she purifies the water.\n\n3:8:2:44\\. Thereupon the wife cleanses with the water the (openings of the)\nvital airs of the victim. The reason why she thus cleanses with water the\n(openings of the) vital airs is this: the food of the gods is living, is\nimmortal (ambrosia) for the immortals; but in quieting and cutting up that\nvictim they kill it. Now the vital airs are water; hence she now puts into it\nthose vital airs, and thus that food of the gods becomes truly living, becomes\nimmortal for the immortals.\n\n3:8:2:55\\. Then as to why it is the wife that cleanses. The wife is a woman,\nand from woman progeny is born here on earth; thus he causes that (creature)\nto be born from that woman; and therefore the wife cleanses (the victim).\n\n3:8:2:66\\. With (Va _g_. S. VI, 14) \'Thy speech I cleanse\' she wipes the\nmouth; with \'Thy breath I cleanse,\' the nostrils; with \'Thine eye I cleanse,\'\nthe eyes; with \'Thine organ of hearing I cleanse,\' the\n\np. 192\n\nears; with \'Thy navel I cleanse,\' that mysterious (opening of a) vital air; or\nwith \'Thy sexual organ I cleanse;\' with \'Thy hind-part I cleanse,\' that\n(opening of a) vital air behind. Thus she puts the vital airs into it, revives\nit. Thereupon, holding the legs together, (she wipes them) with \'Thy feet I\ncleanse;\' for it is on its feet chat it stands firmly; she thus makes it stand\n(on its feet) for the sake of a firm position.\n\n3:8:2:77\\. With one half or the whole of the water that is left, he (the\nAdhvaryu) and the Sacrificer 1 then sprinkle it, beginning from the head;\nthereby they put those vital airs into it, and revive it (beginning) from that\npart.\n\n3:8:2:88\\. Thus, wherever they wound it 2, wherever they hurt it--water being\na means of soothing--there they soothe it by that means of soothing, water,\nthere they heal it with water.\n\n3:8:2:99\\. They sprinkle with (Va _g_. S. VI, 15), \'May thy mind grow full!\nmay thy speech grow full! may thy breath grow full! may thine eye grow full!\nmay thine ear grow full!\' Thus they put the vital airs into it and revive it:\n\'Whatever is sore, whatever hurt in thee, may that fill up and become firm.\'\n\n3:8:2:1010\\. Thus, wherever they wound it, wherever they hurt it--water being\na means of soothing--they soothe it by that means of soothing, water, there\n\np. 193\n\nthey heal it with water: \'May that become pure in thee!\' thereby they render\nit sacrificially pure. With \'Auspicious be the days!\' they pour out (the\nremaining water) behind the victim.\n\n3:8:2:1111\\. Thus, wherever they wound it, wherever they hurt it,--lest\nthereafter the days and nights should be inauspicious 1,--they pour out (the\nwater) behind the victim with, \'Auspicious be the days.\'\n\n3:8:2:1212\\. Thereupon they turn the victim over so as to lie on its back. He\n(the Adhvaryu) puts the (other) stalk of grass thereon, with, \'O plant,\nprotect!\' for the knife is a thunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the\nknife, does not injure it (the victim). He then applies the edge of the knife\nto it (and cuts through it) with, \'Injure it not, O blade!\' for the knife is a\nthunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the knife, does not injure it.\n\n3:8:2:1313\\. He applies that approved edge of his, for that has been made\nsacrificially pure by a text 2. That which is the top part of the stalk he\nputs in his left hand, and that which is the bottom part he takes with his\nright hand.\n\n3:8:2:1414\\. And where he skins (the victim), and whence the blood spirts out,\nthere he smears it (the bottom part with blood) on both ends with (Va _g_. S.\nVI, I6), \'Thou art the Rakshas\' share!\' for that blood is indeed the Rakshas\'\nshare.\n\n3:8:2:1515\\. Having thrown it away (on the utkara), he treads on it with,\n\'Herewith I tread down the Rakshas! herewith I drive away the Rakshas!\nherewith I consign the Rakshas to the\n\np. 194\n\nnethermost darkness!\' Thus it is by means of the sacrifice that he drives away\nthe evil spirits, the Rakshas. And as to its being rootless and severed on\nboth sides,--rootless, forsooth, and severed on both sides, the Rakshas moves\nabout in the air, even as man here moves about in the air rootless and severed\non both sides: therefore it (the grass-end) is rootless and severed on both\nsides.\n\n3:8:2:1616\\. Thereupon they pull out the omentum, and envelop the two spits 1\ntherein with, \'May ye envelop heaven and earth with ghee!\' whereby he endows\nthose two, heaven and earth, with strength and sap, and puts strength and sap\ninto them; and upon those two, thus filled with sap and affording the means of\nsubsistence, these creatures subsist.\n\n3:8:2:1717\\. The two omentum-spits are made of karshmarya wood. For when the\ngods in the beginning seized (slew) a victim, then, as it was drawn upwards,\nits sacrificial essence 2 flowed downwards, and from it sprang a tree; and\nbecause it flowed down from the (victim) as it was drawn (karsh) upwards,\ntherefore (it became) a karshmarya tree 3. With that\n\np. 195\n\nsame sacrificial essence he now perfects it, and makes it whole; therefore the\ntwo omentum-spits are of karshmarya wood.\n\n3:8:2:1818\\. He cuts it (the omentum) off on all sides (from the belly) and\nheats it at the cooking-fire: thus it becomes cooked for him already at this\n(fire) 1. The Agnidh again takes a firebrand (from the _S_ amitra, and walks\nin front). They go behind the pit ( _k_ atvala) and proceed to the \xc3\x82havaniya.\nThe Adhvaryu throws that (top part of the) grass-stalk into the \xc3\x82havaniya\nwith, \'O Vayu, graciously accept the drops!\' for this is the kindler (samidh)\nof the drops 2.\n\n3:8:2:1919\\. Thereupon he heats the omentum while standing on the north side;\nfor he is about to pass by the fire and to roast (the omentum) after walking\nround to the south side. Hereby then he propitiates it, and thus that fire\ndoes not injure him while passing by; this is why he heats the omentum while\nstanding on the north side.\n\n3:8:2:2020\\. They take it along between the sacrificial stake and the fire.\nThe reason why they do not take it across the middle (of the altar) 3, where\nthey take other sacrificial dishes, is lest they should bring the sacrifice in\nthe middle into contact with the uncooked (omentum). And why they do not take\nit there outside (the altar) along the front of the sacrificial stake, is that\nthey would thereby put it outside the sacrifice; therefore they take it along\n\np. 196\n\nbetween the sacrificial stake and the fire. Having gone round to the south\nside, the Pratiprasthat _ri_ roasts it.\n\n3:8:2:2121\\. Thereupon the Adhvaryu, having taken ghee with the dipping-spoon,\npours it upon the omentum, with, \'May Agni graciously accept the ghee, Hail!\'\nThus those drops thereof reach the fire after becoming cooked offerings, made\nwith Svaha (hail)!\n\n3:8:2:2222\\. He then says (to the Maitravaru _n_ a 1), \'Recite to the drops!\'\nHe recites to the drops verses addressed to Agni 2. The reason why he recites\nto the drops verses addressed to Agni, is that rain originates from gifts made\nfrom this earth, for from here it is that Agni obtains the rain; by means of\nthese drops (falling from the omentum) he obtains those (rain) drops, and\nthose drops rain down; therefore he recites to the drops verses addressed to\nAgni. When it is roasted,--\n\n3:8:2:2323\\. The Pratiprasthat _ri_ says, \'It is roasted: proceed 3!\' The\nAdhvaryu, having taken the two spoons and stept across (to the north side of\nthe fire) and called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , says (to the Maitravaru _n_ a),\n\'Prompt for the Svahas 4!\' and offers (the ghee) when the Vasha _t_ has been\npronounced 5.\n\np. 197\n\n3:8:2:2424\\. Having offered, he bastes first the omentum, then the clotted\nghee. Now the Karaka-Adhvaryus, forsooth, baste first the clotted ghee,\narguing that the clotted ghee is the breath; and a _K_ araka-Adhvaryu,\nforsooth, cursed Ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ avalkya for so doing, saying, \'That Adhvaryu has\nshut out the breath; the breath shall depart from him!\'\n\n3:8:2:2525\\. But he, looking at his arms, said, \'These hoary arms--what in the\nworld has become of the Brahman\'s word 1!\' Let him not heed that (objection of\nthe Karakas); for this is the last fore-offering,--and this being a havis-\noffering, at the last fore-offering he first pours ghee into the dhruva, being\nabout to offer the first two butter-portions with it 2. Now, on the present\noccasion, he will first offer the omentum; therefore let him first baste the\nomentum, then the clotted ghee. And though he does not baste the victim with\nghee, \'lest he should baste the uncooked,\' that whole victim of his yet\nbecomes (as it were) basted with ghee in that he bastes the omentum; let him\ntherefore first baste the omentum, then the clotted ghee.\n\n3:8:2:2626\\. Thereupon he makes an \'underlayer\' of ghee (in the _g_ uhu-\nspoon), and lays a piece of gold thereon. Then, cutting off the omentum (from\nthe spits and putting it into the spoon), he says (to the Hot _ri_ ), \'Recite\n(the invitatory prayer) to Agni and Soma\n\np. 198\n\nfor the omentum and fat of the buck!\' He then lays (another) piece of gold on\n(the omentum) and bastes it twice with ghee above.\n\n3:8:2:2727\\. The reason why there is a piece of gold on both sides is this.\nWhen they offer the victim in the fire they slay it; and gold means immortal\nlife: hence it (the victim) rests in immortal life. And so it rises from\nhence, and so it lives; for this reason there is a piece of gold 1 on both\nsides. Having called for the _S_ rausha _t_ , he says (to the Maitravaru _n_\na), \'Prompt (the Hot _ri_ to recite the offering-prayer 2 on) the omentum and\nfat of the buck for Agni and Soma!\' He does not say, \'. . . (the omentum and\nfat) brought forward;\' when the Soma has been pressed he says, \'brought\nforward 3.\' He offers when the Vasha _t_ has been pronounced.\n\n3:8:2:2828\\. Having offered the omentum, he lays the two spits together and\nthrows them after (the omentum into the fire), with, \'Consecrated by Svaha, go\nye to \xc3\x9brdhvanabhas 4, son of the Maruts!\' He does so, thinking, \'Lest these\ntwo wherewith we have cooked the omentum should come to nought.\'\n\n3:8:2:2929\\. The reason why they perform with the omen-tum is this. For\nwhatever deity the victim is seized, that same deity he pleases by means of\nthat fat (part); and that same deity, thus pleased with that fat, waits\n\np. 199\n\npatiently for the other sacrificial dishes being cooked; this is why they\nperform with the omentum.\n\n3:8:2:3030\\. They then cleanse themselves over the pit 1. For in quieting and\ncutting up (the victim) they wound it; and water being a means of soothing,\nthey now soothe it by means of water, heal it by means of water; therefore\nthey cleanse themselves over the pit.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[192:1](sbe2632.htm#fr_478) Or, perhaps, she and the sacrificer, as Saya _n_ a\ntakes it (ya _g_ amana _h_ patni _k_ a). Katy. VI, 6, 4 leaves it doubtful;\nbut the commentator interprets the rule as referring to the Adhvaryu and\nSacrificer, in accordance with the reading of the Ka _n_ va text--\'atha ya _h_\npari _s_ ish _t_ a apo bhavanti tabhir adhvaryu _s_ _k_ a ya _g_ amana _s_ _k_\nanushi _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ ata _h_.\'\n\n[192:2](sbe2632.htm#fr_479) \xc3\x82sthapayanti = sa _m_ _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ apayanti, Saya _n_\na.\n\n[193:1](sbe2632.htm#fr_480) Ned idam anv ahoratra _n_ i _s_ o _k_ an iti, Ka\n_n_ va recension.\n\n[193:2](sbe2632.htm#fr_481) See [III, 8, 1, 5](sbe2631.htm#3:8:1:5).\n\n[194:1](sbe2632.htm#fr_482) The two vapa _s_ rapa _n_ is (omentum-roasters)\nconsist of sticks of karshmarya wood (Gmelina Arborea), one of them being\nquite straight, while the other is bifurcate at the top, thus resembling a\nprop.\n\n[194:2](sbe2632.htm#fr_483) Or, its flesh-juice, medha.
