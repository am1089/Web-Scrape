He then offers (three) oblations of air;--this fire-altar is these\n(three) worlds, and the oblations of air are wind: he thus places the wind\ninto these worlds, and hence there is wind here in these worlds.\n\n9:4:2:22\\. He takes (the air) from outside the Vedi; for that wind which is in\nthese worlds is already contained in this (fire-altar), and he now puts into\nit that wind which is beyond these worlds.\n\n9:4:2:33\\. From outside the Vedi (he takes it),--for the Vedi is this (earth),\nand the wind which is on this (earth) is already contained in this (fire-\naltar): he now puts into it the wind which is beyond this (earth).\n\n9:4:2:44 By his two hollow hands (he takes it), for only in this way is the\ncatching of that (wind brought about). With the Svaha-call (he offers), for he\noffers just under the shafts (of the chariot),--this chariot is yonder sun: he\nthus places the wind on this side of the sun, and hence that one blows on this\nside thereof.\n\n9:4:2:55\\. [He offers, with, Va _g_. S. XVIII, 45], 'Thou art the cloudy\nocean,'--the cloudy ocean, doubtless, is yonder world (of the sky),--'the\ngiver of moisture,'--for that (wind) indeed gives moisture: he thus bestows on\nthis (fire-altar) the wind which is in yonder world;--'blow thou kindly and\npropitiously upon me, hail!'--that is, 'blow favourably and gently upon me!'\n\np. 236\n\n9:4:2:66\\. 'Thou art the stormy (region), the troop of the Maruts,'--the\nstormy (region), the troop of the Maruts, doubtless, is the air-world: he thus\nbestows on this (fire-altar) the wind which is in the air-world;--'blow thou\nkindly and propitiously upon me, hail!'--that is, 'blow favourably and gently\nupon me!'\n\n9:4:2:77\\. 'Thou art the one affording protection and worship,'--the one that\naffords protection and worship, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world: he\nthus bestows upon this (fire-altar) the wind which is in this world;--'blow\nthou kindly and propitiously upon me, hail!'--that is, 'blow favourably and\ngently upon me!'\n\n9:4:2:88\\. With three (formulas) he offers,--three are these worlds, and\nthreefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so\nmuch he thus puts air into these worlds.\n\n9:4:2:99\\. And as to why he offers the oblations of air: he thereby yokes that\nchariot of his; for it was thereby that the gods yoked that chariot for (the\nobtainment of) all their wishes, thinking, 'By it, when yoked, we shall obtain\nthem;' and by that yoked (chariot) they indeed obtained their wishes; and in\nlike manner does the Sacrificer thereby yoke that chariot of his for (the\nobtainment of) all his wishes, thinking, 'By it, when yoked, I shall obtain\nthem;' and by that yoked (chariot) he indeed obtains all his wishes.\n\n9:4:2:1010\\. He yokes it with the oblations of air 1,--the oblations of air\nare the vital airs it is thus with the\n\np. 237\n\nvital airs he yokes it 1. With three (oblations) he yokes it,--there are three\nvital airs, the out-breathing, up-breathing, and through-breathing: it is with\nthese he thus yokes it. Just below the shaft (he offers), for just below the\nshaft the horse is yoked;--with his hands, for by the hands the horse is\nyoked;--in moving round 2, for in moving round the horse is yoked.\n\n9:4:2:1111\\. The right yoke-horse he puts to first, then the left yoke-horse,\nthen the right side-horse: for thus it is (done) among the gods, otherwise in\nhuman (practice). Let him not yoke that (chariot 3) again, lest he should yoke\nagain the yoked one; but let him give away the vehicle, thinking, 'I shall\nreap the benefit of the yoking of it 4.' They carry it as far as the\nAdhvaryu's dwelling, holding it right upwards, for above is that (Agni). He\npresents it to the Adhvaryu, for it is he that performs therewith. Let him,\nhowever, (not) assign it to him (till) the time of the offering-gifts.\n\n9:4:2:1212\\. He then offers the 'Lightsome 5' oblations.\n\np. 238\n\n[paragraph continues] For now the whole Agni was completed; he now wished for\nbrilliance (ru _k_ ), and the gods, by means of these lightsome (oblations),\nendowed him with brilliance; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now\nendow him therewith.\n\n9:4:2:1313\\. And, again, as to why he offers the lightsome oblations. When Pra\n_g_ apati was dismembered, his brilliance departed from him. When the gods\nrestored him, they, by means of these lightsome oblations, endowed him with\nbrilliance; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) endow him therewith.\n\n9:4:2:1414\\. [He offers, with, Va _g_. S. XVIII, 46-48], 'O Agni, what lights\nof thine in the sun 1 . . . ' 'O ye gods, what lights of yours are in the sun.\n. . 1'--'Bestow thou light upon our priests, (work thou light in our kings,\nlight in our people and _S_ udras, bestow light upon me by thy light)!' He\nthus says 'light' each time,--light is immortality: it is immortality he thus\nbestows upon him.\n\n9:4:2:1515\\. He then offers one relating to Varu _n_ a. That whole Agni has\nnow been completed, and he now is the deity Varu _n_ a: it is to him that he\noffers this oblation, and by the oblation he makes him (Agni) a deity, for\nthat one alone is a deity to whom offering is made, but not that one to whom\n(offering is) not (made). With a verse addressed to Varu _n_ a (he offers): he\nthus gratifies him by his own self, by his own deity.\n\n9:4:2:1616\\. And, again, as to why he offers one relating\n\np. 239\n\nto Varu _n_ a. When Pra _g_ apati was dismembered, his strength departed from\nhim. When the gods restored him they, by this (oblation), bestowed strength\nupon him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) bestow it upon him. With a\nverse addressed to Varu _n_ a (he offers),--Varu _n_ a is the ruling power,\nand ruling power means strength: it is thus by strength that he bestows\nstrength upon him.\n\n9:4:2:1717\\. [He offers, with, Va _g_. S. XVIII, 49], 'For this I appeal to\nthee, worshipping thee with prayer,'--that is, 'For that I beseech thee,\nworshipping thee with prayer;'--'for this the Sacrificer imploreth thee with\nofferings,'--that is, 'for this, this Sacrificer implores thee with\nofferings;--'without wrath listen thou here, O Varu _n_ a!'--that is, 'without\nanger listen thou here to us, O Varu _n_ a!'--'take not our life from us, O\nfar-ruler!'--he thereby gives utterance to a surrender of his own self.\n\n9:4:2:1818\\. He then offers the Arka _s_ vamedha-santati 1 oblations. The\nlight (arka), doubtless, is this fire (Agni), and the A _s_ vamedha (horse-\nsacrifice) is yonder sun,--when created, these two were separate: by means of\nthese oblations the gods drew them together and connected them; and in like\nmanner does this (Sacrificer), by means of these oblations, now draw them\ntogether and connect them.\n\n9:4:2:1919\\. [He offers, with, Va _g_. S. XVIII, 50], 'Heaven-like heat,\nhail!'--the heat, doubtless, is yonder sun; he thus establishes yonder sun in\nAgni.\n\n9:4:2:2020\\. 'Heaven-like flame, hail!'--the flame is\n\np. 240\n\nthis Agni: he thus establishes this Agni in yonder sun.\n\n9:4:2:2121\\. 'The Heaven-like shining one, hail!' the shining one, doubtless,\nis yonder sun: he places him again up there.\n\n9:4:2:2222\\. 'Heaven -like light, hail!'--the light is this Agni: he places\nhim again here (on the fire-altar).\n\n9:4:2:2323\\. 'The heaven-like Surya, hail!'--Surya, doubtless, is yonder sun:\nhe thus places yonder sun highest of all this (universe), whence he is the\nhighest of all this (universe).\n\n9:4:2:2424\\. These are five oblations he offers, the fire-altar consists of\nfive layers, a year of five seasons, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni\nis, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus draws together and\nconnects those two.\n\n9:4:2:2525\\. And as to why he says, 'Heaven-like heat, hail! heaven-like\nflame, hail!'--these indeed are names of this fire: he thereby gratifies\nthese, and by the offering he makes them a deity; for only that one is a deity\nto whom an oblation is offered, but not that to whom it is not offered.\nMoreover, by naming them, he thus places them on this fire-altar.\n\n9:4:2:2626\\. These are five oblations he offers,--the fire-altar consists of\nfive layers, and the year of five seasons, and Agni is the year: as great as\nAgni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.\n\n9:4:2:2727\\. Now as to the insertion 1 of (any other) oblations. If he should\nknow any oblation supplied with a brahma _n_ a (dogmatic explanation) let him\noffer it at\n\np. 241\n\nthis time; for it is for (the obtainment of his) wishes that he yokes this\nchariot, and whatsoever oblation he offers on this occasion he offers as one\nthat is (to be) fulfilled.\n\n9:4:2:2828\\. As to this they say, 'Let him not offer (any additional\noblations), lest he should do what is excessive.' Let him, nevertheless, offer\nthem; for it is for (special) wishes that these oblations are offered, and in\nwishes there is nothing excessive.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[236:1](sbe4340.htm#fr_403) That is, these oblations are, as it were, to\nrepresent the team of the chariot.\n\n[237:1](sbe4340.htm#fr_404) Or, he supplies him (Agni).\n\n[237:2](sbe4340.htm#fr_405) According to Katy. _S_ r. XVIII, 6, 1, 2, the\nAdhvaryu first takes a double handful of air from beyond the east side of the\nVedi, and offers it below the right (south) shaft; then from beyond the north\nside to be offered up below the left shaft, and lastly from beyond the south\nside to be offered below the shaft where the right side-horse would be yoked.\nIn each case the girth (or yoke-tie) is to be carried round in the same way as\nif a real horse were yoked.\n\n[237:3](sbe4340.htm#fr_406) Saya _n_ a takes it to mean 'that horse'; and\naccording to Katy. _S_ r. XVIII, 6, 3-5, the carriage is to be carried to the\nAdhvaryu's house, and, at the time when the dakshi _n_ as are presented to the\npriests, it is to be given to that priest along with three horses. The Brahma\n_n_ a, however, does not seem to mention the horses.\n\n[237:4](sbe4340.htm#fr_407) Literally, of the yoked one.\n\n[237:5](sbe4340.htm#fr_408). These oblations are here called 'ru\xe1\xb9\x85mati,'\nbecause the three p. 238 verses used with them contain the word 'ru _k_ ,'\nbeing prayers for the bestowal of light.\n\n[238:1](sbe4340.htm#fr_410) These two verses had already been used in laying\ndown the Dviya _g_ us bricks; see VII, 4, 2, 21.\n\n[239:1](sbe4340.htm#fr_411) That is, the joining together of the fire and the\nhorse-sacrifice.\n\n[240:1](sbe4340.htm#fr_412) Or, location, proper place; cf. [p.\n138](sbe4327.htm#page_138), note [1](sbe4327.htm#fn_245).\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IX, 4, 3. Third Brahma _n_ a](sbe4341.htm)\n\n"
