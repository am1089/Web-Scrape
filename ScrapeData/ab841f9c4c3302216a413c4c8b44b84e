Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing those words, the King Mahi _s_ a in anger\naddressed the charioteer Daruka :-- \xc2\x93Bring over my chariot quickly. That\nchariot is drawn by one thousand excellent horses, is bedecked with banners,\nflags, and ensigns, is furnished with various arms and weapons, and is endowed\nwith good wheels of a white colour, and beautiful poles in which the yoke is\nfixed.\xc2\x94 The charioteer brought the chariot instantly and duly informed the\nking, \xc2\x93O King! I have got the chariot ready at your door, your beautiful\nchariot, bedecked with beautiful carpets and various arms and weapons.\xc2\x94\nHearing that the chariot had been brought, Mahi _s_ a thought, the Devi might\nnot care him, seeing him ugly faced with a pair of horns and therefore decided\nto assume a human shape and then go to the battle. The beauty and cleverness\nare the delights\n\n\n\np. 407\n\n\n\nof women; therefore I will go before Her, with a beautiful body and with all\nthe cleverness and dexterities. For I will never be delighted with anything\nbut that woman looking at me with fondness and becoming passionately attached\nto me.\n\n\n\n8-33. Thus thinking, the powerful King of the Demons quitted the buffalo\nappearance and assumed a beautiful human shape. He put on beautiful ornaments,\narmplates, etc., and wore divine cloths and had garlands on his neck and thus\nshone like a second Kandarpa, the god of Love. Taking, then, all the arrows\nand weapons, he mounted on the chariot, and attended by his army, went to the\nDevi, elated with power and vanity. The Devi blew Her conchshell when She saw\nMahi _s_ asura, the lord of the Danavas, come before Her with a handsome\nappearance, tending to captivate the minds of mistresses and surrounded by\nmany powerful and valiant warriors. The King of the Demons heard the blow of\nthe conchshell, wondrous to all, came up before the Devi and smilingly spoke\nto Her thus :-- O Devi! Whatever person there exists in this world, this wheel\nof Samsara (the eternal round of births and deaths), be he or she a man or a\nwoman, everyone always hankers after pleasure or happiness. And that pleasure\nis derived in this world by the combination of persons with each other; never\nis it seen where this combination is absent. Again this combination is of\nvarious kinds; I will mention them; Hear. Union is of various kinds according\nas it arises out of affection or out of natural consequences. Of these, I will\nnow speak of unions coming out of affection, as far as my understanding goes.\nThe union that comes between father, mother and their sons arises out of\naffection; it is therefore good. The union between brother and brother is\nmiddling, for mutual interests of give and take are there between the two. In\nfact, that union is considered as excellent which leads to happiness of the\nbest sort and that union which leads to lesser happiness is known as mediocre.\nThe union amongst the sailors, coming from distant lands, is known as natural.\nThey come on various errands concerning their varied interests. This\ncombination, because it offers the least amount of happiness, is considered as\nworst. The best union leads in this world to best happiness. O Beloved! The\nconstant union of men and women of the same age is considered as par\nexcellence; for it gives happiness of the very best sort. Both the parties,\nmen and women, are elevated when they want to excel each other in their family\nconnections, qualities, beauty; cleverness, dress, humility and propriety of\nconduct. Therefore, O Dear! If you establish with me that conjugal relation,\nyou will get, no doubt, all the excellent happiness. Specially I will assume\ndifferent forms at my mere will. All the Divine jewels and precious things\nthat I have\n\n\n\np. 408\n\n\n\nacquired after defeating Indra and the other Devas in battle, and others are\nlying in my palace; you can enjoy all of them as my queen consort or you can\nmake a charity of them as you like. O Beautiful One! I am your servant;\nconsequently, at your word, I will no doubt quit my enmity with the Devas. In\nshort, I will do anything that leads to your pleasure and happiness. O Sweet\nspeaking One! O Large-eyed One! My heart is enchanted very much with your\nbeauty; I will do, therefore, as you order me. O One having a broad hip! I am\nvery much distressed; I now take refuge unto You. O One having beautiful\nthighs! I am very much struck with the arrows of Cupid, and I am very much\ndiscomforted; therefore, save me. To protect one who has come under one\xc2\x92s\nrefuge is the best of all virtues. O One of a somewhat whitish body! O One\nhaving a slender waist! I will spend the remaining portion of my life in\nserving you as your obedient servant. Never will I act contrary to your orders\nto the risk even of my life. Take this as literally true and do accordingly. I\nnow throw aside all my weapons before Your feet; O Large eyed! I am very much\ndistressed by the arrows of Cupid; dost Thou therefore show Thy mercy on me. O\nBeautiful One! Never I showed my weakness to Brahma and the other Devas; but\ntoday I acknowledge that before You. I have defeated Brahma and others; they\nare fully acquainted with my prowess in the battlefield. But, O Honoured\nWoman! Though I am so powerful, I now acknowledge myself as your servant.\nBetter look at me and grant your mercy.\n\n\n\n34\\. Vyasa said :-- O King! Mahi _s_ a, the lord of the Daityas, having said\nso, that beautiful Bhagavati laughed loudly and spoke smiling :--\n\n\n\n35-45. The Devi said :-- I do not desire any other body than the Supreme One!\nO Demon! I am His Will-power; I therefore create all these worlds. I am His\nS\xc2\x92iva (auspicious) Prakriti (Nature); That Universal Soul is seeing Me. It is\nowing to His proximity that I am appearing as the Eternal Consciousness,\nmanifesting Itself as this Cosmos. As irons move owing to the proximity of\nmagnets, I, too, though inert, owing to His proximity, work consciously. I do\nnot desire to enjoy the ordinary pleasures; you are very dull and stupid;\nthere is no doubt in this, when you desire sexual union. For women are\nconsidered as chains to hold men in bondage. Men bound up by iron chains can\nobtain freedom at any time, but when they are fastened by women, they can\nnever obtain freedom. O Stupid! You now want to serve the source of urine,\netc. Take refuge under Peace; peace will lead you to happiness. Great pain\narises from connection with women; you know this; then why are you deluded?\nBetter avoid your enmity with the Devas and\n\n\n\np. 409\n\n\n\nroam over the world anywhere you like. Or, if you desire to live, go to\nPatala; or fight with Me. Know this for certain that I am stronger than you. O\nDanava! The Devas collected have sent Me here; I tell you this very truly; I\nam satisfied with you by your words of friendship; therefore dost thou fly\naway while you are living. See! When words are uttered seven times amongst\neach other, friendship is established between saints. That has been done so\namongst us; so there is friendship now between you and me; I won\xc2\x92t take away\nyour life. O hero! If you desire to die, fight gladly; O powerful one! I will,\nno doubt, kill you.\n\n\n\n46-65. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing the Bhagavati\xc2\x92s words, the Danava,\ndeluded by passion, began to speak in beautiful sweet words :-- O Beautiful\nOne! Your body and the several parts thereof are very delicate and beautiful.\nA mere sight of such a lady makes one enchanted. Therefore, O Beautiful faced\none! I fear very much to strike against your body. O Lotus-eyed One! I have\nsubjugated Hari, Hara, the Lokapalas and the several other Devatas; I\ntherefore ask whether it is proper for me to fight with you! O Fair one! If\nyou like, you marry and worship me, or you can return to your desired place\nwhence you have come. You have declared friendship with me; I therefore do not\nlike to strike any weapons on you. I have now spoken for your good and\nwelfare. You can gladly go away. O beautiful one! You are a fair woman with\nbeautiful eyes; what fame shall I earn by killing you! O One of slender waist!\nMurdering a woman, a child, and a Brahmi _n_ certainly makes the murderer\nliable to suffer the consequences thereof. I will certainly carry you today to\nmy place without killing you. If I use force to you, I will not get happiness;\nfor, in such cases, the application of force leads to no happiness. O One\nhaving good hairs! I salute before you and speak that a man cannot be happy\nwithout the lotus face of a woman; similarly a woman cannot be happy without a\nman\xc2\x92s lotus face. Where comes off the good combination between these two, then\nthe highest pitch of happiness is conceived and pain arises on the disjunction\nthereof. True that you are well decked with ornaments all over your body but\nyou seem wanting in cleverness; for you are not worshipping me. Who has\nadvised you to renounce enjoyments? O Sweet speaking One! If this be true;\nthen surely he is your enemy; he has deceived you. O Dear! Leave your this\nstubbornness and marry me; both of us shall then be happy. Vi _sn_ u shines\nwell with Kamala, Brahma looks splendid with Savitri, Rudra is well associated\nwith Parvati and Indra with S\xc2\x92achi, so I will shine well with you; there is no\ndoubt in this. No woman can ever be happy without any good husband. And why\nare you not then, ack-\n\n\n\np. 410\n\n\n\nnowledging me your husband even when you have got him. O Beloved! Where is now\nthat Cupid of dull intellect? Why is he not troubling you with his maddening\ndelicate five arrows? O Fair one! I think that Madana (the god of Love) out of\nhis pity to you, seeing that you are very weak is not striking his arrows on\nyou as he has done to me. O One looking askance! Or it may be that I have got\nsome enmity with that Cupid; else why is he not shooting arrows at you? Or my\nenemies the Devas have advised the God of Love not to dart his arrows on you.\nO One of slender body! As Mandodari had to marry afterwards, when she became\npassionate, a hypocrite, and so she had to repent thinking that she had not\nmarried before a beautiful auspicious king, so I think, O One, having eyes\nlike the young of a deer! You, too, will have to repent like her if you\ndecline to marry me now.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixteenth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the conversation between\nthe Devi and Mahi _s_ asura in S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam, the Mahapura _n_ am,\nof 18,000 verses, by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 17](bk05ch17.htm)\n\n'
