It forms part of the Satapatha-brahma _n_ a. In the\nMadhyandina- _s_ akha of that Brahma _n_ a, which has been edited by Professor\nWeber, the Upanishad, consisting of six adhyayas, begins with the fourth\nadhyaya (or third prapa _th_ aka) of the fourteenth book.\n\nThere is a commentary on the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka-upanishad by Dviveda _s_\nrinaraya _n_ asunu Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga, which has been carefully edited by Weber in\nhis great edition of the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a from a MS. in the Bodleian\nLibrary, formerly belonging to Dr. Mill, in which the Upanishad is called\nMadhyandiniya-brahma _n_ a-upanishad.\n\nIn the Ka _n_ va- _s_ akha the B _ri_ hadara _n_ yaka-upanishad forms the\nseventeenth book of the _S_ atapatha-brahma _n_ a, consisting of six adhyayas.\n\nAs _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's commentary and the gloss of \xc3\x82nandatirtha, edited by Dr. Roer\nin the Bibliotheca Indica, follow the Ka _n_ va- _s_ akha, I have followed the\nsame text in my translation.\n\nBesides Dr. Roer's edition of the text, commentary and gloss of this\nUpanishad, there is Poley's edition of the text. There is also a translation\nof it by Dr. Roer, with large extracts from _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara's commentary.\n\np. xxxi\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V: The Svetasvatara-Upanishad](sbe15007.htm)\n\n"
