Being kindled thou reignest to-day, a god with the gods, O conqueror of\nthousandfold (wealth)! As messenger, as a sage, carry the oblations (to the\ngods).\n\n2\\. O Tanunapat! For him who walks in righteousness the sacrifice is anointed\nwith honey. May he [1](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:2:1) grant thousandfold food.\n\n3\\. Receiving libations, worthy of being magnified\n[1](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:3:1) bring hither to us the worshipful gods. Agni!\nThou art a winner of thousandfold (bliss).\n\n4\\. They have spread with might the eastward-turned sacrificial grass,\nblessing (our tribe) with a thousand men [1](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:4:1), (at\nthe place) where you reign, O \xc3\x82dityas!\n\n5\\. The Prince, the Sovereign, the mighty ones, the eminent ones\n[1](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:5:1), the (Divine) Doors, which are many and more\nthan many, have sent forth streams of ghee.\n\n6\\. Adorned with gold, wearing beautiful ornaments you verily reign high\n[1](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:6:1) in your splendour. Sit down here, ye two Dawns\n[2](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:6:2).\n\n7\\. May the two fine-voiced divine Hot _ri_ s, the sages, perform as the first\nthis sacrifice for us.\n\n8\\. Bharati! I _l_ a! Sarasvati! All ye (goddesses) whom I invoke, promote us\nto splendour.\n\n9\\. Tvash _t_ _ri_ indeed, the eminent (god) has shaped all forms, all cattle.\nDo thou by sacrifice produce their increase.\n\np. 180\n\n10\\. Yield up by thyself, O tree, (the sacrificial food) to the abode of the\ngods [1](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:10:1). May Agni make the offerings relishable.\n\n11\\. Agni going in front of the gods is anointed with this Gayatra song; he\nshines when Svaha is pronounced (over the oblations).\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe _Ri_ shi is Agastya, the metre Gayatri. This \xc3\x82pri hymn is closely related\nto hymn X, 110, the author of which no doubt knew and imitated our hymn.--No\nverses occur in the other Sa _m_ hitas.\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. I have taken dadhat as a third person, the subject being Tanunapat.\nBut it may be a participle referring to ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a _h_ : 'the sacrifice\nwhich procures thousandfold food is anointed with honey.'\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. The text has i\xc2\xb4 _d_ ya _h_.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. 'This is the Da _s_ avira sacrifice of the _S_ aktyas. Ten valiant\nsons are born to those who perform it.' Pa _\xc3\xb1_ _k_ avi _m_ _s_ a Brahma _n_ a.\nXXV, 7, 4.\n\n##### Verse 5.\n\nNote 1. These are evidently names of the divine doors.--As to the nominative\ndura _h_ , see Lanman, p. 486.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. On adhi-vi-ra _g_ , comp. IX, 75, 3. adhi trip _ri_ sh _th_ a _h_\nushasa _h_ vi ra _g_ ati.\n\nNote. 2. I. e. Dawn and Evening.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Literally: 'to the abode, for the gods.' Comp. the corresponding verse\n(10) of the \xc3\x82pri hymn X, 110. deva\xc2\xb4nam pa\xc2\xb4tha _h_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 189](sbe46050.htm)\n\n"
