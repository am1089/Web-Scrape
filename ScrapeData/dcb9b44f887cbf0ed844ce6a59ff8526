On account of the uniformity of view (of the Vedanta-texts, Brahman is to\nbe considered the cause).\n\nIf, as in the argumentations of the logicians, so in the Vedanta-texts also,\nthere were set forth different views concerning the nature of the cause, some\nof them favouring the theory of an intelligent Brahman being the cause of the\nworld, others inclining towards the pradhana doctrine, and others again\ntending in a different direction; then it might perhaps be possible to\ninterpret such passages as those, which speak of the cause of the world as\nthinking, in such a manner as to make them fall in with the pradhana theory.\nBut the stated condition is absent since all the Vedanta-texts uniformly teach\nthat the cause of the world is the intelligent Brahman. Compare, for instance,\n'As from a burning fire sparks proceed in all directions, thus from that Self\nthe pra _n_ as proceed each towards its place; from the pra _n_ as the gods,\nfrom the gods the worlds' (Kau. Up. III, 3). And 'from that Self sprang ether'\n(Taitt. Up. II, 1). And 'all this springs from the Self' ( _Kh_. Up. VII, 26,\n1). And 'this pra _n_ a is born from the Self' (Pr. Up. III, 3); all which\npassages declare the Self to be the cause. That the word 'Self' denotes an\nintelligent being, we have already shown.\n\np. 61\n\nAnd that all the Vedanta-texts advocate the same view as to an intelligent\ncause of the world, greatly strengthens their claim to be considered a means\nof right knowledge, just as the corresponding claims of the senses are\nstrengthened by their giving us information of a uniform character regarding\ncolour and the like. The all-knowing Brahman is therefore to be considered the\ncause of the world, 'on account of the uniformity of view (of the Vedanta-\ntexts).'--A further reason for this conclusion is advanced.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: I, 1, 11](sbe34017.htm)\n\n"
