Shree Krishnu Jee, acquainted with the\nsecrets of the heart; having heard Soodama\'s speech, and understanding what\nhis many wishes were, said laughingly, "Brother! what present has your wife\nsent for me; why do you not give it to me, but keep it pressed down under your\narm?"\n\nHaving heard this, O great king! Soodama was abashed, and his spirits began to\ndroop, when Krishnu hastily snatched the bundle of rice from under his arm;\nhaving then opened it, and eaten two handfuls of rice with the greatest\navidity, when he had taken the third mouthful, Shree Rookmunee Jee laid hold\nof the hand of Huri and said, "O great king! you have given him two worlds,\nwill you not keep some place for your own habitation; this seems to be a\nbrahmin of excellent disposition and very good family, a great religious\nascetic, and one who has abandoned all terrestrial objects, because he has not\nexulted on obtaining wealth, I know, therefore, that he looks upon gain and\nloss alike, rejoices not at obtaining nor sorrows at losing." When Rookmunee\nJee had thus spoken, Shree Krishnu Chund Jee said, "Beloved! this is my best\nfriend,\n\np. 402\n\nhow can I enumerate his many excellent qualities? He remains constantly\nimmersed in the love of me; and in comparison with that love looks upon the\npleasures of the world as grass."\n\nHaving narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja Pureechit,--O\ngreat king! Krishnu, having addressed many speeches and explanations to\nRookmunee Jee, brought Soodama into the house; having after this entertained\nhim with delicacies of all kinds, and given him betel, Huri took Soodama and\nplaced him upon a bed like foam; he was fatigued and knocked up by the\njourney, and enjoyed a pleasant sleep upon the bed; Krishnu having then sent\nfor Bishokurma, said, "Go now and build a very beautiful house for Soodama of\ngold and jewels, and place in it the eight fruits of ascetic severities, and\nthe treasure of Kouveru, consisting of nine gems, in order that no desire of\nhis may be unsatisfied."\n\nWhen Krishnu had thus spoken Bishokurma went and built the house instantly,\nand returned; having mentioned to Krishnu that he had done so, he went home;\nearly in the morning Soodama rose, and went to take leave of Krishnu, after\nhaving bathed, and finished his religious meditations, adoration and worship,\nShree Krishnu Chund Jee was at that time quite unable to speak; but remained\ngazing immersed in affection, with downcast eyes, and stupified, Soodama,\nhaving taken leave and made a salutation, went homewards, and on the road\nbegan to reflect, "I did well in not asking Krishnu for any thing; had I asked\nhim he would certainly have given it, but he would have thought me greedy and\navaricious, no matter, I shall be able to explain all the circumstances to my\nwife. Shree Krishnu Chund Jee treated me with the greatest respect and honour,\nand considered me as free from avarice; this is for me equal to a lakh of\nrupees."\n\nWith these thoughts in his mind Soodama, O great king! came near his village,\nand was surprised at not perceiving either his former residence, or broken\nhut, but a populous\n\np. 403\n\ncity like that of Indru\'s. On seeing this, Soodama was very much grieved, and\nbegan to say, "Lord! what hast thou done? I had one affliction, and thou has\ngiven me another: what has become of my cottage, and where has my wife gone?\nFrom whom shall I enquire, and where shall I search for them?" Having thus\nsaid Soodama went to the gate, and asked the door-keeper, "Whose is this very\nbeautiful house?" The door-keeper replied, "It belongs to Soodama, the friend\nof Shree Krishnu Chund. When upon hearing this Soodama was on the point of\nspeaking, his wife, who had seen him from the inside, came up to her husband,\ndressed in fine clothes and jewels, adorned from head to foot, having eaten\nbetel, and applied perfumes, and accompanied by her female companions; falling\nat his feet, she threw down silken cloths for him to walk upon; and, having\njoined her hands, thus spoke, "Why are you standing there, come into the\nhouse, and banish all anxiety from your mind; after you left, Bishokurma came,\nwho built this house in a second."\n\nO great king! when Soodama had heard his wife speak thus, he went into the\nhouse; and on seeing the great profusion of wealth, was very much dejected.\nThe brahminee said, "Husband! people are rejoiced at obtaining riches, but you\nare sad, what is the reason of this? Please kindly tell me, that the\nperplexities of my mind may be removed?" Soodama replied, "Beloved! this\nwealth is very deceptive, it has deceived, is still deceiving and will\ncontinue to deceive the whole world. Krishnu has bestowed it upon me, not\nhaving confidence in my affection; when have I asked it from him, that he has\ngiven it to me? This is why my mind is sad." The brahminee said, "Husband! you\ndid not ask any thing from Shree Krishnu Chund Jee; but, being acquainted with\nthe secrets of the heart, he knows the thoughts of each individual; in my mind\nthere was a desire for wealth, which\n\np. 404\n\n[paragraph continues] Krishnu has satisfied; do not form any other opinion in\nyour mind upon this subject."\n\nHaving recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja Pureechit,--O\ngreat king! whoever shall hear and repeat this story, shall never, having come\ninto the world, suffer any affliction; and in the end shall go to the\ncelestial paradise.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter LXXXII](psa83.htm)\n\n'
