Vyasa said :-- Indra was quite surprised to see in this state of solitude\nhis dear wife S'achi, large-eyed and overwhelmed with much sorrow and spoke\nthus :-- \xc2\x93O Beloved! I am remaining here alone this desolate place unnoticed\nby all the Jivas; O Auspicious faced One! How have you come to know this! And\nhow is it that you have come here!\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 512\n\n\n\n3-5. S'achi said :-- O Lord of the Devas! I have been able to know this place\nwhere you are staying by the grace of Bhagavati's Feet and I will get you back\nby Her grace. The Devas and Munis all united have installed the King Nahu _s_\na in your throne. That fellow says \xc2\x93O fair One! I am now made the King Indra;\ntherefore you worship me as your husband.\xc2\x94 And thus oppresses me always. O\nDestroyer of other's strength! That vicious one speaks to me thus; I am weak;\nWhat can I do to him?\n\n\n\n6\\. Indra said :-- \xc2\x93O Beautiful One! I am now here waiting for the proper\nopportunity; O auspicious One! You should also make your mind calm and remain\nthere, and wait for the proper time.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n7-12. Vyasa said : -- O King! After Indra had spoken thus, S'achi Devi became\nsorrowful, drew a deep sigh and, trembling, said :-- \xc2\x93O Fortunate One! How can\nI stay there? That vicious man, puffed up with vanity and proud of his\nposition will forcibly bring me under his control. The Devas and Munis say\nthis to me out of his fear :-- O Beautiful One! The Lord of the Devas is now\nvery much distressed with the arrows of the Cupid; therefore go and worship\nhim. O Tormentor of foes! How can the Brahmi _n_ Brihaspati protect me, being\nhimself powerless and under the control of the Devas. O Lord! This is now my\ngrave anxiety; I am a weak woman, having none to protect me and therefore\nalways under the guidance of a man. Fate is now against me; how can I keep\nmyself religious? I am a chaste woman, devoted to my husband; I have got no\nshelter there; who will protect me when I fall into misery!\n\n\n\n13-21. Indra said :-- \xc2\x93O Beautiful One! I will now tell you one means which,\nif you adopt, will no doubt preserve your character in times of crisis. Women\ncannot preserve their chastity when they are protected by others by thousand\nand one means; for lust penetrates into their restless minds and carries them\nto impure ways. It is the good and pure character that preserves a woman from\na vicious course; therefore O Smiling One! You adopt this good conduct and\ncharacter and remain steady in your place. In case that deceitful wicked King\nNahu _s_ a shows his violence upon you, then take time and secretly cheat him,\nO Madalase! Go to him when there will be no other body present and say :--\xc2\x93O\nLord of the world! Please come to me on a conveyance carried by the Ri _s_ is\n(great ascetics), I will then be very delighted and gladly yield myself to\nyou; this is certainly my vow.\xc2\x94 O Beautiful One! When you will say thus, that\nKing, blinded by passion, will engage the Munis for the carriers of his\nconveyance. The ascetics, then, will be angry and curse him; the\n\n\n\np. 513\n\n\n\nMunis will certainly burn him by the fire of their wrath; and the Divine\nMother will no doubt help you. He who remembers the lotus-feet of the Ambika\nDevi never meets with any difficulties; and if there arises any difficulty,\nknow certainly that it is for his immeasurable benefit. Therefore worship,\nwith your whole heart, the Mother of the Universe, Who resides in the jewelled\nisland (Mani Dvipa) according to the words of the Guru Brihaspati.\n\n\n\n22-25. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the Indra's words, S'achi Devi said\n\xc2\x93Let it be so\xc2\x94 and went to Nahu _s_ a, filled with confidence and inspiration\nto carry on the future work. Nahu _s_ a was very glad to see S'achi Devi and\nspoke thus :-- \xc2\x93O Sweet-speaking One! Are you all right? I am now completely\nyours; you have fulfilled my word; therefore I say truly that I am your\nservant. O Gentle-speaking One! When you have come to me, know that I am very\nglad. O Smiling One! Do not feel any shame before me. I am now your devotee;\nworship me. O large eyed One! Speak out what is that dear thing that I can do\nfor you? I will carry that out at once.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n26-27. S'achi said :-- \xc2\x93O Lord Vasava! You have done all the works; now I have\ngot one desire to ask from you, kindly fulfil this and then I will be yours. O\nOne full of auspiciousness! Now fulfil my desire; I am speaking this to you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n28\\. Nahu _s_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Thou, having a face sweet like the Moon! Speak out\nyour desire; I will carry it out. O Beautiful One with nice eye-brows! Even if\nthat be unattainable, I will give that to you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n29-31. S'achi said :-- \xc2\x93O King of Kings! I cannot trust you; Swear on oath\nthat you will fulfill my desire. O King! A truthful King very rare on this\nearth; I will speak out my desire when I will be convinced that you are bound\nby truth. O King! When you will fulfil my desire, I will always remain under\nyour control; this I speak truly to you.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n32\\. Nahu _s_ a said :-- \xc2\x93O Beautiful One! On all the sacrifices and gifts\nthat I have ever made, I swear, on all my merits, that I will certainly carry\nout your word.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n33-37. S'achi said :-- \xc2\x93Indra has got for his vehicles the horse\nUchchais'rava, the Airavata elephant and the chariot; Vasudeva has got vehicle\nGaru _d_ a; Yama has got his buffalo; S'ankara his Bull; Brahma his Swan;\nKartika has got his peacock and Ganes'a has got his mouse. But now, O Lord of\nthe Devas! I want to see your vehicle, never witnessed before: I want to see\nthe Munis and the great ascetics, observing vows, to be your vehicle; this is\nnot Vi _sn_ u's, Rudra's nor of the Devas, and Raks'asas. O King! Let the\nMunis carry your conveyance, this is my ever burning desire. O King of this\nearth! I know you the highest of all Devas; let your glory and splendour\nincrease ever and ever; this is the intense desire reigning in my heart.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 514\n\n\n\n38-56. Vyasa said :-- O King! Hearing S'achi's words, Nahu _s_ a, weak in\nintellect, laughed and beguiled by the Maya of Bhagavati began to praise her\nand said at once :-- \xc2\x93O Beautiful One! Truly you have made a nice suggestion\nof my vehicle. O One having luxuriant hairs! I will soon carry out your words.\nO Sweet-smiling One! Whoever is effeminate and of weak virility, he is never\nable to engage the Munis as his carriers; no doubt, my unbounded strength will\nbe rendered manifest when I come to you on a vehicle carried by the Munis.\nWhat wonder is there that the seven Ri _s_ is (the seven stars of the\nconstellation Great Bear) and all the Devar _s_ is would carry me, knowing me\nas the most capable and superior in all the three worlds by virtue of my sheer\nasceticism?\xc2\x94 Vyasa said :-- O King! The King Nahu _s_ a became very pleased\nand dismissed S'achi Devi. He, then, with a heart flamed with passion, called\nthe Munis and said: --\xc2\x93O Munis! I am now become Indra and endowed with all\npowers thereof; therefore you all do my work without being at all surprised. I\nhave got the seat of Indra but Indrani is not coming to me. I called her to my\npresence and when I informed her of my desire, She had spoken to me with\naffection the following words:-- O Indra of the Devas! O Giver of one's\nhonour! Better come to me on a vehicle carried by the Munis and do thus the\none thing for me that I like. O Mahar _s_ is! To carry out this task is,\nindeed, difficult for me; therefore do you all unite and, out of mercy, do\nthis for me in all its completeness. My heart is being always burnt, as I am\nvery much attached to the wife of Indra; so I take refuge unto you to do this\nwonderful work for me.\xc2\x94 Though this request was very indecent and greatly\nhumiliating yet the Munis agreed to it, out of pity, and also impelled, as it\nwere, by the great Fate. When the Great Seers, the Munis consented to this\nproposal, the King, whose heart was very much attached to the daughter of\nPuloma, became very glad and getting on the beautiful vehicle carried by the\nMunis, told them, move on quickly (Sarpa, Sarpa). Then the King Nahu _s_ a,\ngetting very much impassioned, touched with his feet the heads of the Munis,\nand, being as it were smitten by the arrows of cupid, began to whip frequently\nthe Ri _s_ i Agastya, the best of the ascetics, who devoured the Rak _s_ asa\nVatapi, who was the husband of Lopamudra and who drank out the ocean, saying\nmove on, move on (Sarpa, Sarpa another meaning of which is Snake). The Muni,\nthen, became very angry, on being thus whipped, and cursed him saying :-- \xc2\x93'O\nWicked One! As you are whipping me, saying Sarpa, Sarpa, so go and remain in\nthe dense forest as a huge snake. When many years will elapse and when you\nwill crawl on your own limb and suffer intense troubles, after that you will\nagain come to heaven. You will be free from the curse when you will see the\nKing Yudhi _st_ hira and hear from him the answers to several questions.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\np. 515\n\n\n\n57-67. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus cursed, the King Nahu _s_ a began to chant\nhymns to that best of the Munis, and, while praising, fell from the Heavens\nand instantly turned into a snake. Brihaspati, then, quickly went to the\nManasarovara Lake and informed Indra everything in detail. Indra became very\nglad on hearing in detail of the downfall of the King Nahu _s_ a from Heaven\nand remained there gladly. When the Devas and Munis saw this downfall into the\nearth of Nahu _s_ a, they all went to the Lake Manasarovara where Indra was\nstaying. They then all encouraged Indra and honoured him by bringing him back\nto the Heavens. All the Devas and Ri _s_ is installed Indra on the throne and\nthen performed the Inauguration ceremony of the all auspicious Devi. On\ngetting back his own throne. Indra, too, began to sport in the beautiful\nNandana Garden with his dear consort S'achi, in the home of the Devas. Vyasa\nsaid :-- O King! Indra had to suffer such severe hardships on account of his\nslaying the Mahar _s_ i Vis'varupa, the Lord of the Asuras. Subsequently\nthrough the grace of the Devi, he got back his own seat. O King! Thus I have\nnarrated before you to my best, this excellent story of the killing of\nVritrasura and thus have answered your question. O Ornament of the Kuru\nfamily! The fruits will be exactly according to the Karma done. The effects of\nthe Karma done must be borne whether they be auspicious or inauspicious. (So\nIndra had to suffer for his Karma, the killing of a Brahma _n_ a.)\n\n\n\nHere ends the Ninth Chapter of the Sixth Book on Indra's getting the fruits of\nhis killing a Brahma _n_ a and on the downfall of the King Nahu _s_ a from the\nHeavens in the Mahapura _n_ am S'ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by\nMahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 10](bk06ch10.htm)\n\n"
