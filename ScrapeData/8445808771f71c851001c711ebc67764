(A student who desires to become) a house-holder shall bathe, free from\nanger and elation, with the permission of his teacher, and take for a wife a\nyoung female of his own caste, who does neither belong to the same Gotra nor\nhas the same Pravara, who has not had intercourse (with another man), 1\n\n2\\. Who is not related within four degrees on the mother's side, nor within\nsix degrees on the father s side. 2\n\n3\\. Let him kindle the nuptial fire. 3\n\np. 43\n\n4\\. Let him not turn away a guest who comes in the evening. 4\n\n5\\. (A guest) shall not dwell in his house without receiving food. 5\n\n6\\. If a Brahma _n_ a who has come for shelter to the house of a (householder)\nreceives no food, on departure he will take with him all the spiritual merit\nof that (churlish host). 6\n\n7\\. But a Brahma _n_ a who stays for one night only is called a guest. For\n(the etymological import of the word) atithi (a guest) is 'he who stays for a\nshort while only.' 7\n\n8\\. A Brahma _n_ a who lives in the same village (with his host) and a visitor\non business, or pleasure (are) not (called guests. But a guest), whether he\narrives at the moment (of dinner) or at an inopportune time, must not stay in\nthe house of a (householder) without receiving food. 8\n\n9\\. (A householder) who has faith, is free from covetousness, and (possesses\nwealth) sufficient for (performing) the Agnyadheya-sacrifice, must become an\nAgnihotrin. 9\n\n10\\. He (who possesses wealth) sufficient for (the expenses of) a Soma,\nsacrifice shall not abstain from offering it. 10\n\np. 44\n\n11\\. (A householder) shall be industrious in reciting the Veda, offering\nsacrifices, begetting children, and (performing his other duties). 11\n\n12\\. Let him honour visitors (who come) to his house by rising to meet them,\nby (offering them) seats, by speaking to them kindly and extolling their\nvirtues, 12\n\n13\\. And all creatures by (giving them) food according to his ability. 13\n\n14\\. A householder alone performs sacrifices, a householder alone performs\nausterities, and (therefore) the order of householders is the most\ndistinguished among the four. 14\n\n15\\. As all rivers, both great and small, find a resting-place in the ocean,\neven so men of all orders find protection with householders. 15\n\n16\\. As all creatures exist through the protection afforded by their mothers,\neven so all mendicants subsist through the protection afforded by\nhouseholders.\n\n17\\. A Brahma _n_ a who always carries water (in his gourd), who always wears\nthe sacred thread, who daily recites the Veda, who avoids the food of\noutcasts, who approaches (his wife) in the proper season, and offers\nsacrifices in accordance with the 17\n\np. 45\n\nrules (of the Veda, after death) never falls from Brahman's heaven.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[42:1](sbe1411.htm#fr_239) **VIII**.

The\nfire intended is the g _ri_ hya or smarta, the sacred household fire, which\naccording o this Sutra must be kindled on the occasion of the marriage\nceremony, while other Sm _ri_ tis permit of its being lighted on the division\nof the paternal estate.\n\n[43:4](sbe1411.htm#fr_242) Vish _n_ u LXVII, 28-29.\n\n[43:5](sbe1411.htm#fr_243) Vish _n_ u LXVII, 30.\n\n[43:6](sbe1411.htm#fr_244) Vish _n_ u LXVII, 33.\n\n[43:7](sbe1411.htm#fr_245) Identical with Vish _n_ u LXVII, 34; Manu III, 102.\n\n[43:8](sbe1411.htm#fr_246) Vish _n_ u LXVII, 35; Manu III, 105.\n\n[43:9](sbe1411.htm#fr_247) Vish _n_ u LIX, 2. The Agnihotra which is here\n'intended is, of course, the _S_ rauta Agnihotra, to be performed with three\nfires. The Agnyadheya is one of the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ as with which the _S_\nrautagnihotrin has to begin his rites.\n\n[43:10](sbe1411.htm#fr_248) Vish _n_ u LIX, 8.\n\n[44:11](sbe1411.htm#fr_249) I agree with K _ri_ sh _n_ apa _n_ _d_ ita that\nthe word 'and' used in this enumeration serves the purpose of calling to mind\nthat there are other minor duties. The three named specially are the so-called\n'three debts;' see below, XI, 48.\n\n[44:12](sbe1411.htm#fr_250) Vish _n_ u LXVII, 45 Gautama V, 38-41.\n\n[44:13](sbe1411.htm#fr_251) Vish _n_ u LXVII, 26.\n\n[44:14](sbe1411.htm#fr_252)-17.

'Who always wears the sacred thread' p. 45 may\nalso mean 'who always wears his upper in the manner required at a sacrifice,'\ni.e. passes it over the left and under the right arm.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter IX](sbe1412.htm)\n\n"
