Suta said :-- O Ri _s_ is! Hearing the words of the Lord of Lak _s_ mi,\nall the Devas became pleased and they spoke. The Devas said :-- O Deva of the\nDevas! O Maha Vi _sn_ u! O Thou, the Creator, Preserver and the Destroyer of\nthe Universe! O Vi _sn_ u! The Bindhya mountain has risen very high and it has\nstopped the Sun's course. Therefore all the works on earth are suspended. We\nare not receiving our share of Yaj\xc3\xb1as. Now where we will go, what we will do,\nwe do not know. S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan said :-- \xc2\x93O Devas! There is now in Benares the\nMuni Agastya of indomitable power, in devoted service of that Primordial\nS'akti Bhagavati, the Creatrix of this Universe. This Muni alone can put a\nstop to this abnormal Bindhya Range. Therefore it behoves you all to go to\nthat fiery Dvija Agastya at Benares where the people get Nirva _n_ a; the\nHighest Place and pray to him (to kindly fulfil your object).\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n7-19. Suta said: -- O Ri _s_ is! Thus ordered by Vi _sn_ u, the gods felt\nthemselves comforted and, saluting Him, went to the city of Benares.\n\n\n\nIn a moment they went to the Holy City of Benares, and bathing there at the Ma\n_n_ ikar _n_ ika gha _t_ , worshipped the Devas with devotion and offered\nTarpa _n_ as to the Pitris and duly made their charities. Then they went to\nthe excellent \xc3\x82s'rama of the Muni Agastya. The hermitage was full of quiet\nquadruped animals; adorned with various trees, peacocks, herons, geese and\nChakravakas and various other birds, tigers, wolves, deer, the wild boars,\nrhinoceros, young elephants, Ruru deer and others. Though there were the\nferocious animals, yet the place was free from fear and it looked exceedingly\nbeautiful. On arriving before the Muni, the gods fell prostrate before him and\nbowed down again and again to him. They then chanted hymns to him and said :--\nO Lord of Dvijas! O Thou honoured and most worshipful! Victory to Thee. Thou\nart sprung from a water jar. Thou art the destroyer of\n\n\n\np. 1031\n\n\n\nVatapi, the Asura. Obeisance to Thee! O Thou, full of S\xc2\x92ri, the son of\nMitravaru _n_ a! Thou art the husband of Lopamudra. Thou art the store house\nof all knowledge. Thou art the source of all the S'astras. Obeisance to Thee!\nAt Thy rise, the waters of the ocean become bright and clear; so obeisance to\nThee! At Thy rise (Canopus) the Kas'a flower blossoms. Thou art adorned with\nclots of matted hair on Thy head and Thou always livest with Thy disciples.\nS\xc2\x92ri Rama Chandra is one of Thy chief disciples. O great Muni! Thou art\nentitled to praise from all the Devas! O Best! The Store-house of all\nqualities! O great Muni! We now bow down to Thee and Thy wife Lopamudra! O\nLord! O very Energetic! We all are very much tormented by an unbearable pain\ninflicted on us by the Bindhya Range and we therefore take refuge of Thee. Be\ngracious unto us. Thus praised by the gods, the highly religious Muni Agastya,\nthe twice born, smiled and graciously said :--\n\n\n\n20-27. O Devas! You are the lords of the three worlds, superior to all,\nhighsouled, and the preserver of the Lokas. If you wish, you can favour,\ndisfavour, do anything. Especially He who is the Lord of heavens, whose weapon\nis the thunderbolt, and the eight Siddhis are ever at his service is your\nIndra, the Lord of the Devas. What is there that he cannot do? Then there is\nAgni, Who burns everything and always carries oblations to the gods and the\nPitris, Who is the mouth piece of the Devas. Is there anything impracticable\nwith him! O Devas! Then again Yama is there amongst you, the Lord of the Rak\n_s_ asas, the Witness of all actions, and always quick in giving punishment to\nthe offenders, that terrible looking Yama Raja. What is there that he cannot\naccomplish?\n\n\n\nStill, O Devas! if there be anything required by you that awaits my co-\noperation, give out at once and I will do it undoubtedly. Hearing these words\nof the Muni, the Devas became very glad and joyfully began to say what they\nwanted. O Mahar _s_ i! The Bindhya mountain has risen very high and thwarted\nthe Sun's course in the Heavens. A cry of universal distress and consternation\nhas arisen and the three worlds are now verging to the ruins. O Muni! Now what\nwe want is this that Thou, by Thy power of Tapas, curbest the rise of this\nBindhya Mountain. O Agastya! Certainly, by Thy fire and austerities, that\nmountain will be brought down and humiliated. This is what we want.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Sixth Chapter of the Tenth Book on the Devas' praying to the\nMuni Agastya for checking the abnormal rise of the Bindhya Range in the Maha\nPura _n_ am S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda\nVyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 7](bk10ch07.htm)\n\n"
