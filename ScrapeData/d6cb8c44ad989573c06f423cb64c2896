D. Barnett, [1911], at sacred-texts.com\n\n* * *\n\n#### IX. The Everlasting Nay 1\n\nVerily this great unborn Self it is that is compact of understanding amid the\nlife-breaths, that lies in the ether within the heart, master of all, lord of\nall, ruler of all; He becomes not greater by a good deed nor less by an ill\ndeed; He is king of all, ruler of born beings, guardian of born beings, the\ndyke holding asunder these worlds that they fall not one into another.\nBrahmans seek to know Him by reading the Veda, by sacrifice, by charity, by\nmortification. Knowing\n\np. 75\n\n[paragraph continues] Him, a man becomes a saint; wandering friars wander\nforth seeking Him for their world. Understanding this, the ancients desired\nnot offspring: "What is offspring to us who have this Self for this world?" So\nhaving departed from desire of sons, from desire of substance, and desire of\nthe world, they went about begging. For desire of sons is desire of substance,\ndesire of substance is desire of the world; these are both desires.\n\nThis Self is _Nay, Nay:_ not to be grasped, for He is not grasped; not to be\nbroken, for He is not broken; unclinging, for He clings not; He is not bound,\nHe trembles not, He takes no hurt. One [who knows this] is overcome neither by\nhaving done evil for His sake nor by having done good for His sake; he\novercomes both; work done and work not done grieve him not.\n\nThis is said by a verse:\n\nThe Brahman\'s constant majesty by works  \nNor waxes more, nor wanes. This shall he trace;  \nThis known, ill deeds defile him nevermore.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[74:1](brk37.htm#fr_33) B\xe1\xb9\x9bihad-\xc4\x81ra\xe1\xb9\x87yaka Upanishad, IV. iv. 22-23.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X: The Spirit Within](brk38.htm)\n\n'
