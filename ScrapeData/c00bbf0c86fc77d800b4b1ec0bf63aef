and all  \nUpon the plain in *numbers *made,(?)  \nImpetuous warriors, stood arrayed.  \n\np. 363  \n\nRed at the sight flashed Lakshman's eyes,  \nHis bosom heaved tumultuous sighs,  \nAnd forth the fire of fury broke  \nLike flame that flashes through the smoke.  \nLike some fierce snake the hero stood:  \nHis bow recalled the expanded hood,  \nAnd in his shaft-head bright and keen  \nThe flickering of its tongue was seen:  \nAnd in his own all-conquering might  \nThe venom of its deadly bite.  \nPrince Angad marked his angry look,  \nAnd every hope his heart forsook.  \nThen, his large eyes with fury red,  \nTo Angad Lakshman turned and said:  \n   'Go tell the king that Lakshman waits  \nFor audience at the city gates,  \nWhose heart, O tamer of thy foes,  \nIs heavy with his brother's woes.  \nBid him to Rama's word attend,  \nAnd ask if he will aid his friend.  \nGo, let the king my message learn:  \nThen hither with all speed return.'  \n   Prince Angad heard and wild with grief  \nCried as he looked upon the chief:  \n''Tis Lakshman's self: impelled by ire  \nHe seeks the city of my sire.'  \nAt the fierce words and furious look  \nOf Raghu'a son he quailed and shook,  \nBack through the city gates he sped,  \nAnd, laden with the tale of dread,  \nSought King Sugriva, filled his ears  \nAnd Ruma's with his doubts and fears.  \nTo Ruma and the king he bent,  \nAnd clasped their feet most reverent,  \nClasped the dear feet of Tara, too,  \nAnd told the startling tale anew.  \n   But King Sugriva's ear was dulled,  \nBy love and wine and languor lulled,  \nNor did the words that Angad spake  \nThe slumberer from his trance awake.  \nBut soon as Raghu's son came nigh  \nThe startled Vanars raised a cry,  \nAnd strove to win his grace, while dread  \nEach anxious heart disquieted.  \nThey saw, and, as they gathered round,  \nRose from the mighty throng a sound  \nLike torrents when they downward dash,  \nOr thunder with the lightning's flash.  \nThe shouting of the Vanars broke  \nSugriva's slumber, and he woke:  \nStill with the wine his eyes were red,  \nHis neck with flowers was garlanded.  \nRoused at the voice of Angad came  \nTwo Vanar lords of rank and fame;  \nOne Yaksha, one Prabhava hight,-  \nWise counsellors of gain and right.  \nThey came and raised their voices high,  \nAnd told that Raghu's son was nigh:  \n'Two brothers steadfast in their truth,  \nEach glorious in the bloom of youth,  \nWorthy of rule, have left the skies,  \n\nAnd clothed their forms in men's disguise.  \nOne at thy gates, in warlike hands  \nHolding his mighty weapon, stands.  \nHis message is the charioteer  \nThat brings the eager envoy near,  \nUrged onward by his bold intent,  \nAnd by the hest of Rama sent. [1](ry306.htm#fn_636)  \nThe gathered Vanars saw and fled,  \nAnd raised aloud their cry of dread.  \nSon of Queen Tara, Angad ran  \nTo parley with the godlike man.  \nStill fiery-eyed with rage and hate  \nStands Lakshman at the city gate,  \nAnd trembling Vanars scarce can fly  \nScathed by the lightning of his eye.  \nGo with thy son, thy kith and kin,  \nThe favour of the prince to win,  \nAnd bow thy reverent head that so  \nHis fiery wrath may cease to glow.  \nWhat righteous Rama bids thee, do,  \nAnd to thy plighted word be true.'  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[362:1](ry305.htm#fr_635) The rainbow.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Canto XXXII.: Hanuman's Counsel.](ry306.htm)\n\n"
