Pra _g_ apati once upon a time spake unto Purusha\n\np. 173\n\n[paragraph continues] Naraya _n_ a, \'Offer sacrifice! offer sacrifice!\' He\nspake, \'Verily, thou sayest to me, "Offer sacrifice! offer sacrifice!" and\nthrice have I offered sacrifice: by the morning-service the Vasus went forth,\nby the midday-service the Rudras, and by the evening-service the \xc3\x82dityas; now\nI have but the offering-place 1, and on the offering-place I am sitting.\'\n\n12:3:4:22\\. He spake, \'Offer yet sacrifice! I will tell thee such a thing that\nthy hymns shall be strung as a pearl on a thread, or a thread through a\npearl.\'\n\n12:3:4:33\\. And he spake thus unto him, \'At the (chanting of the)\nBahishpavamana, at the morning-service, thou shalt hold on to the Udgat _ri_\nfrom behind, saying, "Thou art a falcon formed of the Gayatri metre,--I hold\non to thee: bear me unto well-being!"\n\n12:3:4:44\\. \'And at the midday Pavamana thou shalt hold on to the Udgat _ri_\nfrom behind, saying, "Thou art an eagle formed of the Trish _t_ ubh metre,--I\nhold on to thee: bear me unto well-being! "\n\n12:3:4:55\\. \'And at the \xc3\x82rbhava-pavamana, at the evening-service, thou shalt\nhold on to the Udgat _ri_ from behind, saying, "Thou art a _Ri_ bhu formed of\nthe _G_ agat metre,--I hold on to thee: bear me unto well-being!"\n\n12:3:4:66\\. \'And at the close of each pressing thou shalt mutter, "In me be\nlight, in me might, in me glory, in me everything!"\'\n\n12:3:4:77\\. Now light, indeed, is this (terrestrial) world, might the air-\nworld, glory the heavens, and what other worlds there are, they are everything\n(else).\n\n12:3:4:88\\. And light, indeed, is Agni, might Vayu (the\n\np. 174\n\nwind), glory \xc3\x82ditya (the sun), and what other gods there are they are\neverything.\n\n12:3:4:99\\. And light, indeed, is the _Ri_ g-veda, might the Ya _g_ ur-vela,\nglory the Sama-veda, and what other Vedas there are they are everything.\n\n12:3:4:1010\\. And light, indeed, is speech, might the breath, glory the eye,\nand what other vital airs there are they are everything.\n\n12:3:4:1111\\. Let him know this:--\'All the worlds have I placed within mine\nown self, and mine own self have I placed within all the worlds; all the gods\nhave I placed within mine own self, and mine own self have I placed within all\nthe gods; all the Vedas have I placed within mine own self, and mine own self\nhave I placed within all the Vedas; all the vital airs have I placed within\nmine own self, and mine own self have I placed within the vital airs.\' For\nimperishable, indeed, are the worlds, imperishable the gods, imperishable the\nVedas, imperishable the vital airs, imperishable is the All: and, verily,\nwhosoever thus knows this, passes from the imperishable unto the imperishable,\nconquers recurrent death, and attains the full measure of life.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[173:1](sbe44056.htm#fr_498) ?
