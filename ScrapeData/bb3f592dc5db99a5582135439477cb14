The wolf shall tlead a distant path, and the robber one still more\ndistant! On a distant path shall move the biting rope (the serpent), on a\ndistant path the plotter of evil!  \n3\\. Thy eyes and thy jaw we crush, O tiger, and also all thy twenty claws.  \n4\\. We crush the tiger, the foremost of animals, armed with teeth. Next, too,\nthe thief, and then the serpent, the wizard, and also the wolf.  \n5\\. The thief that approacheth to-day, crushed to pieces he goeth away. Where\nthe paths are precipitate he shall go, Indra shall slay him with his bolt!  \n6\\. The teeth of the wild beast are dulled, and broken are his ribs. Out of\nthy sight the dragon shall go, down shall tumble the hare-hunting beast!  \n7\\. The (jaw, O beast,) that thou shuttest together, thou shalt not open up;\nthat which thou openest up, thou shalt not shut together!--Born of Indra, born\nof Soma, thou, (my charm), art Atharvan's crusher of tigers.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 15.
