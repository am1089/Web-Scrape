The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra _g_ apati, were\ncontending for (the possession of) this (terrestrial) world. The gods drove\nout the Asuras, their rivals and enemies, from this world; whence those who\n\np. 430\n\nare godly people make their sepulchres so as not to be separate (from the\nearth), whilst those (people) who are of the Asura nature, the Easterns and\nothers, (make their sepulchral mounds) so as to be separated (from the earth),\neither on a basin 1 or on some such thing.\n\n13:8:2:22\\. He then encloses it by means of enclosing-stones: what those\nenclosing-stones (round the fire-hearths) are, that they are here 2. With a\nformula he sets up those, silently these: he thus keeps separate what refers\nto the gods and what refers to the Fathers. With (an) undefined (number of\nstones he encloses it), for undefined is yonder world.\n\n13:8:2:33\\. He then sweeps that (site) with a pala _s_ a (Butea frondosa)\nbranch--what the sweeping (signified) on that occasion 3, that (it does) here\n--with (Va _g_. S. XXXV, I), 'Let the niggards avaunt from hence, the perverse\nscorners of the gods!'--he thereby expels from this world the niggards, the\nperverse haters of the gods, the Asura-Rakshas;--'it is the place of this\nSoma-offerer,' for he who has performed a Soma-sacrifice is a Soma-\nofferer;--'(an abode) distinguished by lights, by days, by nights,'--he\nthereby makes him to\n\np. 431\n\nbe of the world of the seasons, the days and nights;--\n\n13:8:2:44\\. 'May Yama grant him an abode;'--for Yama has power over the abode\nin this (earth), and it is him he solicits for an abode therein for this (dead\nman). He throws out this (branch) to the right (south), the other 1 to the\nleft (north) side: he thus keeps the divine separate from what belongs to the\nFathers.\n\n13:8:2:55\\. He (the Adhvaryu) then yokes (the team) to the plough on the south\nside,--some say on the north side: he may do as he chooses. Having given the\norder, saying, 'Yoke!' he (the Sacrificer) utters the formula (Va _g_. S.\nXXXV, 2), 'May Savit _ri_ vouchsafe for thy bones a place in the earth!'--\nSavit _ri_ now indeed vouchsafes a place in the earth for his (the deceased\nman's) bones;--'Let the oxen be yoked therefore!' for it is indeed for this\nwork that the oxen are yoked.\n\n13:8:2:66\\. It is (a team) of six oxen,--six seasons are a year: on the\nseasons, on the year, as a firm foundation, he thus establishes him. Having\nturned round (the plough) from right to left 2, he ploughs the first furrow\nwith (Va _g_. S. XXXV, 3), 'May Vayu purify!' along the north side (along the\ncord) towards the west 3; with, 'May\n\np. 432\n\n[paragraph continues] Savit _ri_ purify!' along the west side towards the\nsouth; with, 'With Agni's lustre!' along the south side towards the east;\nwith, 'With Surya's brilliance!' along the front side towards the north.\n\n13:8:2:77\\. Four furrows he ploughs with a formula: he thereby establishes him\nin whatever food there is in the four quarters. And (as to why it is done)\nwith a formula,--certain, assuredly, is the sacrificial formula (ya _g_ us),\nand certain are these quarters.\n\n13:8:2:88\\. He then ploughs across the body (of the sepulchral site)--he\nthereby establishes him in whatever food there is in the year 1\\--silently\nwith (an) undefined (number of furrows), for undefined is yonder world.\n\n13:8:2:99\\. Having performed the work for which he has put the team to that\n(plough), he now unfastens it: 'Let the oxen be unyoked!' he says, for it is\nfor that work that the oxen were yoked. To the right (south) side 2 he removes\nthis (plough and team), to the left (side) arty other: he thus keeps the\ndivine separate from what' belongs to the Fathers.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[430:1](sbe44114.htm#fr_1147) I take the ' _k_ amu' to be a shallow stone\nbasin or trough, either solid or consisting of masonry (bricks) in the manner\nof our stone-lined graves.\n\n[430:2](sbe44114.htm#fr_1148) Cf. VII, 1, 1, 12 seq. 'The enclosing-stones are\nthe womb: he thus encloses the seed here sown in a womb. . . And, again, the\nGarhapatya hearth is this (terrestrial) world, and the enclosing-stones are\nthe waters: he thus surrounds this world with water.'\n\n[430:3](sbe44114.htm#fr_1149) Viz. in building the Garhapatya hearth (VII, 1,\n1, 11 seqq.); no such sweeping taking place in preparing the site for the\n\xc3\x82havaniya (VII, 3, 1, 7).\n\n[431:1](sbe44114.htm#fr_1150) Viz. that used in sweeping the Garhapatya, VII,\n7, 1, 5.\n\n[431:2](sbe44114.htm#fr_1151) That is, having driven the plough round from the\nsouth side to the north, in the non-sunwise direction (i.e. keeping the\nsepulchral site on the left hand side).\n\n[431:3](sbe44114.htm#fr_1152) In ploughing the site of the fire-altar, the\nfirst furrow was drawn along the south side from west to east; and then, in\nsunwise fashion, from the south-west corner round along the west, north, and\neast sides; see VII, 2, 2, 9 seqq.\n\n[432:1](sbe44114.htm#fr_1153) The Sacrificer's body (trunk) or self, like that\nof Pra _g_ apati, is as usual identified with the year (Father Time).\n\n[432:2](sbe44114.htm#fr_1154) Or rather to the south-west side, whilst at the\nAgni _k_ ayana (VII, 2, 2, 21) it was done towards the north-east.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: XIII, 8, 3.
