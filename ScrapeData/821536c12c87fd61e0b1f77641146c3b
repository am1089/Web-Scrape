VI.\n\nDivisions of the Sama-veda: of the Atharva-veda. Four Pauran\xcc\x81ik Sanhitas.\nNames of the eighteen Puran\xcc\x81as. Branches of knowledge. Classes of Rishis.\n\nYOU shall now hear, Maitreya, how Jaimini, the pupil of Vyasa, divided the\nbranches of the Sama-veda. The son of Jaimini was Sumantu, and his son was\nSukarman, who both studied the same Sanhita under Jaimini 1. The latter\ncomposed the Sahasra Sanhita (or compilation of a thousand hymns, &c.), which\nhe taught to two disciples, Hiran\xcc\x81yanabha, also named Kau\xc5\x9balya (or of Ko\xc5\x9bala),\nand Paushyinji 2. Fifteen disciples of the latter were the authors of as many\nSanhitas: they were called the northern chaunters of the Saman. As many more,\nalso the disciples of Hiran\xcc\x81yanabha, were termed the eastern chaunters of the\nSaman, founding an equal number of schools. Lokakshi, Kuthumi, Kushidi, and\nLangali were the pupils of Paushyinji; and by them and their disciples many\nother branches were formed. Whilst another scholar of Hiran\xcc\x81yanabha, named\nKriti, taught twenty-four Sanhitas to as many pupils; and by them, again, was\nthe Sama-veda divided into numerous branches 3.\n\nI will now give you an account of the Sanhitas of the Atharva-veda. The\nillustrious Muni Sumantu taught this Veda to his pupil Kabandha, who made it\ntwofold, and communicated the two portions to Devader\xc5\x9ba and to Pathya. The\ndisciples of Devader\xc5\x9ba were Maudga, Brahmabali,\n\np. 283\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc5\x9aaulkayani, and Pippalada. Pathya had three pupils,\nJajali, Kumudadi, and \xc5\x9aaunaka; and by all these were separate branches\ninstituted. \xc5\x9aaunaka having divided his Sanhita into two, gave one to Babhru,\nand the other to Saindhavayana; and from them sprang two schools, the\nSaindhavas and Munjake\xc5\x9bas 4. The principal subjects of difference in the\nSanhitas of the Atharva-veda are the five Kalpas or ceremonials: the Nakshatra\nKalpa, or rules for worshipping the planets; the Vaitana Kalpa, or rules for\noblations, according to the Vedas generally; the Sanhita Kalpa, or rules for\nsacrifices, according to different schools; the \xc3\x81ngirasa Kalpa, incantations\nand prayers for the destruction of foes and the like; and the Santi Kalpa, or\nprayers for averting evil 5.\n\nAccomplished in the purport of the Puran\xcc\x81as, Vyasa compiled a Pauran\xcc\x81ik\nSanhita, consisting of historical and legendary traditions, prayers and hymns,\nand sacred chronology 6. He had a distinguished disciple, Suta, also termed\nRomaharshan\xcc\x81a, and to him the great Muni communicated the Puran\xcc\x81as. Suta had\nsix scholars, Sumati, Agnivarchas, Mitrayu, \xc5\x9aan\xc5\x9bapayana, Akritavran\xcc\x81a, who is\nalso called Ka\xc5\x9byapa, and Savern\xcc\x81i. The three last composed three fundamental\nSanhitas; and Romaharshan\xcc\x81a himself compiled a fourth, called Romaharshan\xcc\x81ika.\nThe substance of which four Sanhitas is collected into this (Vishn\xcc\x81u) Puran\xcc\x81a.\n\nThe first of all the Puran\xcc\x81as is entitled the Brahma. Those who are\n\np. 284\n\nacquainted with the Puran\xcc\x81as enumerate eighteen, or the Brahma, Padma,\nVaishn\xcc\x81ava, \xc5\x9aaiva, Bhagavata, Naradiya, Markan\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81eya, \xc3\x81gneya, Bhavishyat,\nBrahma Vaivartta, Lainga, Varaha, Skanda, Vamana, Kaurmma, Matsya, Garura,\nBrahman\xcc\x81d\xcc\x81a. The creation of the world, and its successive reproductions, the\ngenealogies of the patriarchs and kings, the periods of the Manus, and the\ntransactions of the royal dynasties, are narrated in all these Puran\xcc\x81as. This\nPuran\xcc\x81a which I have repeated to you, Maitreya, is called the Vaishn\xcc\x81ava, and\nis next in the series to the Padma; and in every part of it, in its narratives\nof primary and subsidiary creation, of families, and of periods, the mighty\nVishn\xcc\x81u is declared in this Puran\xcc\x81a 7.\n\nThe four Vedas, the six Angas (or subsidiary portions of the Vedas, viz.\n\xc5\x9aiksha, rules of reciting the prayers, the accents and tones to be observed;\nKalpa, ritual; Vyakaran\xcc\x81a, grammar; Nirukta, glossarial comment; Chhandas,\nmetre; and Jyotish, (astronomy), with Mimansa (theology), Nyaya (logic),\nDharma (the institutes of law), and the Puran\xcc\x81as, constitute the fourteen\nprincipal branches of knowledge: or they are considered as eighteen, with the\naddition of these four; the \xc3\x81yur-veda, medical science (as taught by\nDhanwantari); Dhanur-veda, the science of archery or arms, taught by Bhrigu;\nGandharba-veda, or the drama, and the arts of music, dancing, &c., of which\nthe Muni Bharata was the author; and the Artha \xc5\x9bastram, or science of\ngovernment, as laid down first by Vrihaspati.\n\nThere are three kinds of Rishis, or inspired sages; royal Rishis, or princes\nwho have adopted a life of devotion, as Viswamitra; divine Rishis, or sages\nwho are demigods also, as Narada; and Brahman Rishis, or sages who are the\nsons of Brahma, or Brahmans, as Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha and others 8.\n\np. 285\n\nI have thus described to you the branches of the Vedas, and their\nsubdivisions; the persons by whom they were made; and the reason why they were\nmade (or the limited capacities of mankind). The same branches are instituted\nin the different Manwantaras. The primitive Veda, that of the progenitor of\nall things, is eternal: these branches are but its modifications (or\nVikalpas).\n\nI have thus related to you, Maitreya, the circumstances relating to the Vedas,\nwhich you desired to hear. Of what else do you wish to be informed 9?\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[282:1](vp080.htm#fr_805) The Vayu makes Sukarman the grandson of Sumantu, his\nson being called Sunwat.\n\n[282:2](vp080.htm#fr_806) Some copies read Paushpinji. The Vayu agrees with\nour text, but alludes to a legend of Sukarman having first taught a thousand\ndisciples, but they were all killed by Indra, for reading on an unlawful day,\nor one when sacred study is prohibited.\n\n[282:3](vp080.htm#fr_807) The Vayu specifies many more names than the Vishn\xcc\x81u,\nbut the list is rather confused. Amongst the descendants of those named in the\ntext, Rayananiya (or Ran\xcc\x81ayaniya), the son of Lokakshi, is the author of a\nSanhita still extant: Saumitri his son was the author of three Sanhitas:\nPara\xc5\x9bara, the son of Kuthumi, compiled and taught six Sanhitas: and \xc5\x9aaligotra,\na son of Langali, established also six schools. Kriti was of royal descent: he\nand Paushyinji were the two most eminent teachers of the Sama-veda.\n\n[283:4](vp080.htm#fr_808) According to the commentator, Munjake\xc5\x9ba is another\nname for Babhru; but the Vayu seems to consider him as the pupil of Saindhava,\nbut the text is corrupt.\n\n[283:5](vp080.htm#fr_809) The Vayu has an enumeration of the verses contained\nin the different Vedas, but it is very indistinctly given in many respects,\nespecially as regards the Yajush. The Rich is said to comprise 8600 Richas.\nThe Yajush, as originally compiled by Vyasa, 12000: of which the Vajasaneyi\ncontains 1900 Richas, and 7600 Brahmanas; the Charaka portion contains 6026\nstanzas: and consequently the whole exceeds 12000 verses. The stanzas of the\nSaman are said to be 8014; and those of the Atharvan 5980. Mr. Colebrooke\nstates the verses of the whole Yajush to be 1987; of the Salapalka Brahmana of\nthe same Veda 7624; and of the Atharvan 6015.\n\n[283:6](vp080.htm#fr_810) Or of stories (\xc3\x81khyanas) and minor stories or tales\n(Upakhyanas); of portions dedicated to some particular divinity, as the \xc5\x9aiva-\ngita, Bhagavad-gita, &c.; and accounts of the periods called Kalpas, as the\nBrahma Kalpa, Varaha Kalpa, &c.\n\n[284:7](vp080.htm#fr_811) For remarks upon this enumeration, see Introduction.\n\n[284:8](vp080.htm#fr_812) A similar enumeration is given in the Vayu, with\nsome additions. Rishi is derived from Rish, 'to go to' or 'approach.' The\nBrahmarshis, it is said, are descendants of the five patriarchs, who were the\nfounders of races or Gotras of Brahmans, or Ka\xc5\x9byapa, Va\xc5\x9bisht\xcc\x81ha, Angiras,\nAtri, and Bhrigu. The Devarshis are Nara and Narayan\xcc\x81a, the sons of Dharma;\nthe Balakhilyas, who sprung from Kratu; Kardama, the son of Pulaha; Kuvera,\nthe son of Pulastya; Achala, the son of Pratyusha; p. 285 Narada and Parvata,\nthe sons of Ka\xc5\x9byapa. Brahmarshis are Ikshwaku and other princes. The\nBrahmarshis dwell in the sphere of Brahma; the Devarshis in the region of the\ngods; and the Rajarshis in the heaven of Indra.\n\n[285:9](vp080.htm#fr_813) No notice is taken here of a curious legend which is\ngiven in the Mahabharata, in the Gada Parvan. It is there said, that during a\ngreat drought the Brahmans, engrossed by the care of subsistence, neglected\nthe study of the sacred books, and the Vedas were lost. The Rishi Saraswata\nalone, being fed with fish by his mother Saraswati, the personified river so\nnamed, kept up his studies, and preserved the Hindu scriptures. At the end of\nthe famine the Brahmans repaired to him to be taught, and sixty thousand\ndisciples again acquired a knowledge of the Vedas from Saraswata. This legend\nappears to indicate the revival, or more probably the introduction, of the\nHindu ritual by the race of Brahmans, or the _people_ called Saraswata; for,\naccording to the Hindu geographers, it was the name of a nation, as it still\nis the appellation of a class of Brahmans who chiefly inhabit the Panjab. (As.\nRes. VII. 219, 338, 341.) The Saraswata Brahmans are met with in many parts of\nIndia, and are usually fair-complexioned, tall, and handsome men. They are\nclassed in the Jati malas, or popular lists of castes, amongst the five Gaura\nBrahmans, and are divided into ten tribes: they are said also to be especially\nthe Purohits or family priests of the Kshatriya or military castes: (see the\nJati mala, printed in Price's Hindi Selections, II. 280:) circumstances in\nharmony with the purport of the legend, and confirmatory of the Saraswatas of\nthe Panjab having been prominent agents in the establishment of the Hindu\nreligion in India. The holy land of the Hindus, or the primary seat, perhaps,\nof Brahmanism, has for one of its boundaries the Saraswati river: see [p.\n181](vp061.htm#page_181), n.
