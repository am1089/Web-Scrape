The words Bhumi (earth), Antariksha (sky), and Dyu 1 (heaven) form eight\nsyllables. One foot of the Gayatri consists of eight syllables. This (one\nfoot) of it is that (i. e. the three worlds). And he who thus knows that foot\nof it, conquers as far as the three worlds extend.\n\n2\\. The _Ri_ kas, the Ya _g_ u _m_ shi, and the Samani form eight syllables.\nOne foot (the second) of the Gayatri consists of eight syllables. This (one\nfoot) of it is that (i.e. the three Vedas, the _Ri_ g-veda, Ya _g_ ur-veda,\nand Sama-veda). And he who thus knows that foot of it, conquers as far as that\nthreefold knowledge extends.\n\n3\\. The Pra _n_ a (the up-breathing), the Apana (the down-breathing), and the\nVyana (the back-breathing) form eight syllables. One foot (the third) of the\nGayatri consists of eight syllables. This (one foot) of it is that (i. e. the\nthree vital breaths). And he who thus knows that foot of it, conquers as far\nas there is anything that breathes. And of that (Gayatri, or speech) this\nindeed is the fourth (turiya), the bright (dar _s_ ata) foot, shining high\nabove the skies 2. What is here called turiya (the fourth) is meant for _k_\naturtha (the fourth); what is called dar _s_ atam padam (the bright foot) is\nmeant for him who is as it were seen (the person in the sun); and what is\ncalled parora _g_ as (he who shines high above the\n\np. 197\n\nskies) is meant for him who shines higher and higher above every sky. And he\nwho thus knows that foot of the Gayatri, shines thus himself also with\nhappiness and glory.\n\n4\\. That Gayatri (as described before with its three feet) rests on that\nfourth foot, the bright one, high above the sky. And that again rests on the\nTrue (satyam), and the True is the eye, for the eye is (known to be) true. And\ntherefore even now, if two persons come disputing, the one saying, I saw, the\nother, I heard, then we should trust the one who says, I saw. And the True\nagain rests on force (balam), and force is life (pra _n_ a), and that (the\nTrue) rests on life 1. Therefore they say, force is stronger than the True.\nThus does that Gayatri rest with respect to the self (as life). That Gayatri\nprotects (tatre) the vital breaths (gayas); the gayas are the pra _n_ as\n(vital breaths), and it protects them. And because it protects (tatre) the\nvital breaths (gayas), therefore it is called Gayatri. And that Savit _ri_\nverse which the teacher teaches 2, that is it (the life, the pra _n_ a, and\nindirectly the Gayatri); and whomsoever he teaches, he protects his vital\nbreaths.\n\n5\\. Some teach that Savitri as an Anush _t_ ubh 3 verse, saying that speech is\nAnush _t_ ubh, and that we teach\n\np. 198\n\nthat speech. Let no one do this, but let him teach the Gayatri as Savitri 1.\nAnd even if one who knows this receives what seems to be much as his reward\n(as a teacher), yet this is not equal to one foot of the Gayatri.\n\n6\\. If a man (a teacher) were to receive as his fee these three worlds full of\nall things, he would obtain that first foot of the Gayatri. And if a man were\nto receive as his fee everything as far as this threefold knowledge extends,\nhe would obtain that second foot of the Gayatri. And if a man were to receive\nas his fee everything whatsoever breathes, he would obtain that third foot of\nthe Gayatri. But 'that fourth bright foot, shining high above the skies 2'\ncannot be obtained by anybody--whence then could one receive such a fee?\n\n7\\. The adoration 3 of that (Gayatri):\n\n'O Gayatri, thou hast one foot, two feet, three feet, four feet 4. Thou art\nfootless, for thou art not known. Worship to thy fourth bright foot above the\nskies.' If 5 one (who knows this) hates some\n\np. 199\n\none and says, 'May he not obtain this,' or 'May this wish not be accomplished\nto him,' then that wish is not accomplished to him against whom he thus prays,\nor if he says, 'May I obtain this.'\n\n8\\. And thus _G_ anaka Vaideha spoke on this point to Bu _d_ ila \xc3\x82 _s_ vatara\n_s_ vi 1: 'How is it that thou who spokest thus as knowing the Gayatri, hast\nbecome an elephant and carriest me?' He answered: 'Your Majesty, I did not\nknow its mouth. Agni, fire, is indeed its mouth; and if people pile even what\nseems much (wood) on the fire, it consumes it all. And thus a man who knows\nthis, even if he commits what seems much evil, consumes it all and becomes\npure, clean, and free from decay and death.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[196:1](sbe15092.htm#fr_573) Dyu, nom. Dyaus, must be pronounced Diyaus.\n\n[196:2](sbe15092.htm#fr_574) Parona _g_ as, masc., should be taken as one\nword, like paroksha, viz. he who is beyond all ragas, all visible skies.\n\n[197:1](sbe15092.htm#fr_575) _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara understood the True (satyam) by tad,\nnot the balam, the force.\n\n[197:2](sbe15092.htm#fr_576) The teacher teaches his pupil, who is brought to\nhim when eight years old, the Savitri verse, making him repeat each word, and\neach half verse, till he knows the whole, and by teaching him that Savitri, he\nis supposed to teach him really the pra _n_ a, the life, as the self of the\nworld.\n\n[197:3](sbe15092.htm#fr_577) The verse would be, _Ri_ g-veda V, 82, 1:\n\nTat savitur v _ri_ _n_ imahe vaya _m_ devasya bho _g_ anam  \n_S_ resh _th_ am sarvadhatama _m_ turam bhagasya dhimahi.\n\n[198:1](sbe15092.htm#fr_578) Because Gayatri represents life, and the pupil\nreceives life when be learns the Gayatri.\n\n[198:2](sbe15092.htm#fr_579) See before, \xc2\xa7 2.\n\n[198:3](sbe15092.htm#fr_580) Upasthana is the act of approaching the gods,\n\xcf\x80\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x83\xce\xba\xe1\xbd\xbb\xce\xbd\xce\xb7\xcf\x83\xce\xb9\xcf\x82 Angehen, with a view of obtaining a request. Here the application\nis of two kinds, abhi _k_ arika, imprecatory against another, and abhyudayika,\nauspicious for oneself. The former has two formulas, the latter one. An\nupasthana is here represented as effective, if connected with the Gayatri.\n\n[198:4](sbe15092.htm#fr_581) Consisting of the three worlds, the threefold\nknowledge, the threefold vital breaths, and the fourth foot, as described\nbefore.\n\n[198:5](sbe15092.htm#fr_582) I have translated this paragraph very freely, and\ndifferently from _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara. The question is, whether dvishyat with iti can be\nused in the sense of abhi _k_ ara, or imprecation. if not, I do not see how\nthe words should be construed. The expression yasma upatish _th_ ate p. 199 is\nrightly explained by Dvivedaga\xe1\xb9\x85ga, yadartham evam upatish _th_ ate.\n\n[199:1](sbe15092.htm#fr_583) A _s_ vatarasya _s_ vasyapatyam, _S_ a\xe1\xb9\x85kara.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 15](sbe15093.htm)\n\n"
