V.\n\nNanda returns with the infants Krishn\xcc\x81a and Balarama to Gokula. Putana killed\nby the former. Prayers of Nanda and Ya\xc5\x9boda.\n\nWHEN Vasudeva was set at liberty, he went to the waggon of Nanda, and found\nNanda there rejoicing that a son was born to him 1. Vasudeva spake to him\nkindly, and congratulated him on having a son in his old age. "The yearly\ntribute," he added, "has been paid to the king, and men of property should not\ntarry near the court, when the business that brought them there has been\ntransacted. Why do you delay, now that your affairs are settled? Up, Nanda,\nquickly, and set off to your own pastures; and let this boy, the son whom\nRohin\xcc\x81i has borne me, accompany you, and be brought up by you as this your own\nson." Accordingly Nanda and the other cowherds, their goods being placed in\ntheir waggons, and their taxes having been paid to the king, returned to their\nvillage.\n\nSome time after they were settled at Gokula, the female fiend Putana, the\nchild-killer, came thither by night, and finding the little Krishn\xcc\x81a asleep,\ntook him up, and gave him her breast to suck 2. Now whatever child is suckled\nin the night by Putana instantly dies; but Krishn\xcc\x81a, laying hold of the breast\nwith both hands, sucked it with such violence, that he drained it of the life;\nand the hideous Putana, roaring aloud, and giving way in every joint, fell on\nthe ground expiring. The inhabitants of Vraja awoke in alarm at the cries of\nthe fiend, ran to the spot, and beheld Putana lying on the earth, and Krishn\xcc\x81a\nin her arms. Ya\xc5\x9boda snatching up Krishn\xcc\x81a, waved over him a cow-tail brush to\nguard him from harm, whilst Nanda placed dried cow-dung powdered upon his\n\np. 507\n\nhead; he gave him also an amulet 3, saying at the same time, "May Hari, the\nlord of all beings without reserve, protect you; he from the lotus of whose\nnavel the world was developed, and on the tip of whose tusks the globe was\nupraised from the waters. May that Ke\xc5\x9bava, who assumed the form of a boar,\nprotect thee. May that Ke\xc5\x9bava, who, as the man-lion, rent with his sharp nails\nthe bosom of his foe, ever protect thee. May that Ke\xc5\x9bava, who, appearing first\nas the dwarf, suddenly traversed in all his might, with three paces, the three\nregions of the universe, constantly defend thee. May Govinda guard thy head;\nKe\xc5\x9bava thy neck; Vishn\xcc\x81u thy belly; Janarddana thy legs and feet; the eternal\nand irresistible Narayan\xcc\x81a thy face, thine arms, thy mind, and faculties of\nsense. May all ghosts, goblins, and spirits malignant and unfriendly, ever fly\nthee, appalled by the bow, the discus, mace, and sword of Vishn\xcc\x81u, and the\necho of his shell. May Vaikunt\xcc\x81ha guard thee in the cardinal points; and in\nthe intermediate ones, Madhusudana. May Rishike\xc5\x9ba defend thee in the sky, and\nMahidhara upon earth." Having pronounced this prayer to avert all evil, Nanda\nput the child to sleep in his bed underneath the waggon. Beholding the vast\ncarcass of Putana, the cowherds were filled with astonishment and terror.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[506:1](vp122.htm#fr_1468) It is literally \'went to the cart\' or \'waggon;\' as\nif Nanda and his family dwelt in such a vehicle, as the Scythians are said to\nhave done. The commentator explains \xc5\x9aakat\xcc\x81a \'the place of loosing or\nunharnessing the waggon.\' In the Bhagavata, Vasudeva does not quit Mathura,\nbut goes to the halting ground of Nanda, who has come to that city to pay his\ntaxes: explained by the comment.\n\n[506:2](vp122.htm#fr_1469) In the Hari Van\xc5\x9ba this female fiend is described as\ncoming in the shape of a bird.\n\n[507:3](vp122.htm#fr_1470) The Raksha, the preserver, or preservative against\ncharms, is a piece of thread or silk, or some more costly material, bound\nround the wrist or arm, with an appropriate prayer such as that in the text.\nBesides its application to children, to avert the effects of evil eyes, or to\nprotect them against Dains or witches, there is one day in the year, the Rakhi\nPurnima, or full moon in the month of \xc5\x9aravan (July--August), when it is bound\nupon the wrists of adults by friendly or kindred Brahmans, with a short prayer\nor benediction. The Rakhi is also sent sometimes by persons of distinction,\nand especially by females, to members of a different family, or even race and\nnation, to intimate a sort of brotherly or sisterly adoption.
