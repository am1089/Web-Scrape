Her face was like the\nmoon; her hair like the clouds; her eyes like those of a muskrat; her eyebrows\nlike a bent bow; her nose like a parrot\'s bill; her neck like that of a dove;\nher teeth like pomegranate grains; the red colour of her lips like that of a\ngourd; her waist lithe and bending like the pards: her hands and feet like\nsoftest blossoms; her complexion like the jasmine-in fact, day by day the\nsplendour of her youth increased.\n\nWhen she had arrived at maturity, her father and mother began often to resolve\nin their minds the subject of her marriage. And the people of all that country\nside ruled by Birbar king of Madanpur bruited it abroad that in the house of\nHiranyadatt had been born a daughter by whose beauty gods, men, and munis\n(sages) were fascinated.\n\nThereupon many, causing their portraits to be painted, sent them by messengers\nto Hiranyadatt the Baniya, who showed them all to his daughter. But she was\ncapricious, as beauties sometimes are, and when her father said, "Make choice\nof a husband thyself," she told him that none pleased her, and moreover she\nbegged of him to find her a husband who possessed good looks, good qualities,\nand good sense.\n\nAt length, when some days had passed, four suitors came from four different\ncountries. The father told them that he must have from each some indication\nthat he possessed the required qualities; that he was pleased with their\nlooks, but that they must satisfy him about their knowledge.\n\n"I have," the first said, "a perfect acquaintance with the Shastras (or\nScriptures); in science there is none to rival me. As for my handsome mien, it\nmay plainly be seen by you."\n\nThe second exclaimed, "My attainments are unique in the knowledge of archery.\nI am acquainted with the art of discharging arrows and killing anything which\nthough not seen is heard, and my fine proportions are plainly visible to you."\n\nThe third continued, "I understand the language of land and water animals, of\nbirds and of beasts, and I have no equal in strength. Of my comeliness you\nyourself may judge."\n\n"I have the knowledge," quoth the fourth, "how to make a certain cloth which\ncan be sold for five rubies: having sold it I give the proceeds of one ruby to\na Brahman, of the second I make an offering to a deity, a third I wear on my\nown person, a fourth I keep for my wife; and, having sold the fifth, I spend\nit in giving feasts. This is my knowledge, and none other is acquainted with\nit. My good looks are apparent."\n\nThe father hearing these speeches began to reflect, "It is said that excess in\nanything is not good. Sita[88] was very lovely, but the demon Ravana carried\nher away; and Bali king of Mahabahpur gave much alms, but at length he became\npoor.[89] My daughter is too fair to remain a maiden; to which of these shall\nI give her?"\n\nSo saying, Hiranyadatt went to his daughter, explained the qualities of the\nfour suitors, and asked, "To which shall I give thee?" On hearing these words\nshe was abashed; and, hanging down her head, knew not what to reply.\n\nThen the Baniya, having reflected, said to himself, "He who is acquainted with\nthe Shastras is a Brahman, he who could shoot an arrow at the sound was a\nKshatriya or warrior, and he who made the cloth was a Shudra or servile. But\nthe youth who understands the language of birds is of our own caste. To him,\ntherefore, will I marry her." And accordingly he proceeded with the betrothal\nof his daughter.\n\nMeanwhile Madansena went one day, during the spring season into the garden for\na stroll. It happened, just before she came out, that Somdatt, the son of the\nmerchant Dharmdatt, had gone for pleasure into the forest, and was returning\nthrough the same garden to his home.\n\nHe was fascinated at the sight of the maiden, and said to his friend,\n"Brother, if I can obtain her my life will be prosperous, and if I do not\nobtain her my living in the world will be in vain."\n\nHaving thus spoken, and becoming restless from the fear of separation, he\ninvoluntarily drew near to her, and seizing her hand, said--"If thou wilt not\nform an affection for me, I will throw away my life on thy account."\n\n"Be pleased not to do this," she replied; "it will be sinful, and it will\ninvolve me in the guilt and punishment of shedding blood; hence I shall be\nmiserable in this world and in that to be."\n\n"Thy blandishments," he replied, "have pierced my heart, and the consuming\nthought of parting from thee has burnt up my body, and memory and\nunderstanding have been destroyed by this pain; and from excess of love I have\nno sense of right or wrong. But if thou wilt make me a promise, I will live\nagain."\n\nShe replied, "Truly the Kali Yug (iron age) has commenced, since which time\nfalsehood has increased in the world and truth has diminished; people talk\nsmoothly with their tongues, but nourish deceit in their hearts; religion is\ndestroyed, crime has increased, and the earth has begun to give little fruit.\nKings levy fines, Brahmans have waxed covetous, the son obeys not his sire\'s\ncommands, brother distrusts brother; friendship has departed from amongst\nfriends; sincerity has left masters; servants have given up service; man has\nabandoned manliness; and woman has abandoned modesty. Five days hence, my\nmarriage is to be; but if thou slay not thyself, I will visit thee first, and\nafter that I will remain with my husband."\n\nHaving given this promise, and having sworn by the Ganges, she returned home.\nThe merchant\'s son also went his way.\n\nPresently the marriage ceremonies came on, and Hiranyadatt the Baniya expended\na lakh of rupees in feasts and presents to the bridegroom. The bodies of the\ntwain were anointed with turmeric, the bride was made to hold in her hand the\niron box for eye paint, and the youth a pair of betel scissors. During the\nnight before the wedding there was loud and shrill music, the heads and limbs\nof the young couple were rubbed with an ointment of oil, and the bridegroom\'s\nhead was duly shaved. The wedding procession was very grand. The streets were\na blaze of flambeaux and torches carried in the hand, fireworks by the ton\nwere discharged as the people passed; elephants, camels, and horses richly\ncaparisoned, were placed in convenient situations; and before the procession\nhad reached the house of the bride half a dozen wicked boys and bad young men\nwere killed or wounded.[90] After the marriage formulas were repeated, the\nBaniya gave a feast or supper, and the food was so excellent that all sat down\nquietly, no one uttered a complaint, or brought dishonour on the bride\'s\nfamily, or cut with scissors the garments of his neighbour.\n\nThe ceremony thus happily concluded, the husband brought Madansena home to his\nown house. After some days the wife of her husband\'s youngest brother, and\nalso the wife of his eldest brother, led her at night by force to her\nbridegroom, and seated her on a bed ornamented with flowers.\n\nAs her husband proceeded to take her hand, she jerked it away, and at once\nopenly told him all that she had promised to Somdatt on condition of his not\nkilling himself.\n\n"All things," rejoined the bridegroom, hearing her words, "have their sense\nascertained by speech; in speech they have their basis, and from speech they\nproceed; consequently a falsifier of speech falsifies everything. If truly you\nare desirous of going to him, go!\n\n"Receiving her husband\'s permission, she arose and went off to the young\nmerchant\'s house in full dress. Upon the road a thief saw her, and in high\ngood humour came up and asked -\n\n"Whither goest thou at midnight in such darkness, having put on all these fine\nclothes and ornaments?"\n\nShe replied that she was going to the house of her beloved.\n\n"And who here," said the thief, "is thy protector?"\n\n"Kama Deva," she replied, "the beautiful youth who by his fiery arrows wounds\nwith love the hearts of the inhabitants of the three worlds, Ratipati, the\nhusband of Rati,[91] accompanied by the kokila bird,[92] the humming bee and\ngentle breezes." She then told to the thief the whole story, adding -\n\n"Destroy not my jewels: I give thee a promise before I go, that on my return\nthou shalt have all these ornaments."\n\nHearing this the thief thought to himself that it would be useless now to\ndestroy her jewels, when she had promised to give them to him presently of her\nown good will. He therefore let her go, and sat down and thus soliloquized:\n\n"To me it is astonishing that he who sustained me in my mother\'s womb should\ntake no care of me now that I have been born and am able to enjoy the good\nthings of this world. I know not whether he is asleep or dead. And I would\nrather swallow poison than ask man for money or favour. For these six things\ntend to lower a man:--friendship with the perfidious; causeless laughter;\naltercation with women; serving an unworthy master; riding an ass, and\nspeaking any language but Sanskrit. And these five things the deity writes on\nour fate at the hour of birth:--first, age; secondly, action; thirdly, wealth;\nfourthly, science; fifthly, fame. I have now done a good deed, and as long as\na man\'s virtue is in the ascendant, all people becoming his servants obey him.\nBut when virtuous deeds diminish, even his friends become inimical to him."\n\nMeanwhile Madansena had reached the place where Somdatt the young trader had\nfallen asleep.\n\nShe awoke him suddenly, and he springing up in alarm quickly asked her, "Art\nthou the daughter of a deity? or of a saint? or of a serpent? Tell me truly,\nwho art thou? And whence hast thou come?"\n\nShe replied, "I am human--Madansena, the daughter of the Baniya Hiranyadatt.\nDost thou not remember taking my hand in that grove, and declaring that thou\nwouldst slay thyself if I did not swear to visit thee first and after that\nremain with my husband?"\n\n"Hast thou," he inquired, "told all this to thy husband or not?"\n\nShe replied, "I have told him everything; and he, thoroughly understanding the\nwhole affair, gave me permission."\n\n"This matter," exclaimed Somdatt in a melancholy voice, "is like pearls\nwithout a suitable dress, or food without clarified butter,[93] or singing\nwithout melody; they are all alike unnatural. In the same way, unclean clothes\nwill mar beauty, bad food will undermine strength, a wicked wife will worry\nher husband to death, a disreputable son will ruin his family, an enraged\ndemon will kill, and a woman, whether she love or hate, will be a source of\npain. For there are few things which a woman will not do. She never brings to\nher tongue what is in her heart, she never speaks out what is on her tongue,\nand she never tells what she is doing. Truly the Deity has created woman a\nstrange creature in this world." He concluded with these words: "Return thou\nhome with another man\'s wife I have no concern."\n\nMadansena rose and departed. On her way she met the thief, who, hearing her\ntale, gave her great praise, and let her go unplundered.[94]\n\nShe then went to her husband, and related the whole matter to him. But he had\nceased to love her, and he said, "Neither a king nor a minister, nor a wife,\nnor a person\'s hair nor his nails, look well out of their places. And the\nbeauty of the kokila is its note, of an ugly man knowledge, of a devotee\nforgiveness, and of a woman her chastity."\n\nThe Vampire having narrated thus far, suddenly asked the king, "Of these\nthree, whose virtue was the greatest?"\n\nVikram, who had been greatly edified by the tale, forgot himself, and\nejaculated, "The Thief\'s."\n\n"And pray why?" asked the Baital.\n\n"Because," the hero explained, "when her husband saw that she loved another\nman, however purely, he ceased to feel affection for her. Somdatt let her go\nunharmed, for fear of being punished by the king. But there was no reason why\nthe thief should fear the law and dismiss her; therefore he was the best."\n\n"Hi! hi! hi!" laughed the demon, spitefully. "Here, then, ends my story."\n\nUpon which, escaping as before from the cloth in which he was slung behind the\nRaja\'s back, the Baital disappeared through the darkness of the night, leaving\nfather and son looking at each other in dismay.\n\n"Son Dharma Dhwaj," quoth the great Vikram, "the next time when that villain\nVampire asks me a question, I allow thee to take the liberty of pinching my\narm even before I have had time to answer his questions. In this way we shall\nnever, of a truth, end our task."\n\n"Your words be upon my head, sire," replied the young prince. But he expected\nno good from his father\'s new plan, as, arrived under the sires-tree, he heard\nthe Baital laughing with all his might."\n\nSurely he is laughing at our beards, sire," said the beardless prince, who\nhated to be laughed at like a young person.\n\n"Let them laugh that win," fiercely cried Raja Vikram, who hated to be laughed\nat like an elderly person.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nThe Vampire lost no time in opening a fresh story.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Vampire\'s Fifth Story.
