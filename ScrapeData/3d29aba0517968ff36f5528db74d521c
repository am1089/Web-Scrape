Bring forward, ye pious singers, stirred in your thoughts\n[1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:1:1), (the ladle) which is turned towards the gods.\nCarrying (the sacrificial butter) from left to right\n[2](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:1:2) it turns eastward, rich in strength, bringing the\noffering to Agni, full of ghee.\n\n2\\. When born thou hast filled the two worlds, nay thou hast even exceeded\nthem, O friend of sacrifices [1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:2:1). May, O Agni, thy\nseven-tongued horses [2](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:2:2) move along, by the greatness\nof heaven and earth [3](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:2:3).\n\n3\\. Heaven and Earth the worshipful [1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:3:1) establish\nthee as Hot _ri_ for the house, whenever the pious human tribes offering food\nmagnify the bright light.\n\n4\\. (Thou art) seated, the great one, in a firm place\n[1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:4:1), between the two mighty Heavens\n[2](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:4:2), thou who art longed for--(between) the two\nunited [3](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:4:3) never-ageing, inviolable wives, the two\njuice-yielding milch-cows [4](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:4:4) of the far-reigning one\n[5](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:4:5).\n\n5\\. Thy, the great (god's) laws, O Agni, are great. Through the power of thy\nmind thou hast spread out the two worlds. Thou hast become a messenger at thy\nbirth, thou, O bull, the leader of the tribes.\n\n6\\. Or bind to the pole by means of thy (art of) harnessing the two long-\nmaned, red (horses) of _Ri_ ta, that swim in ghee\n[1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:6:1), and carry hither, O god, all gods; perform\nsplendid worship, O _G_ atavedas!\n\n7 [1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:7:1). Even from heaven thy shining lights have\nshone; thy splendour follows many resplendent dawns, when the gods, O Agni,\npraised the cheerful Hot _ri_ 's work [2](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:7:2) who eagerly\nburns in the forests [3](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:7:3).\n\np. 245\n\n8\\. Whether it be the gods who rejoice in the wide air, or those who dwell in\nthe heavenly light, or those who are helpful [1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:8:1),\nready to hear our call, and worshipful; or whether the horses of thy chariot,\nO Agni, have turned themselves hither--\n\n9\\. Come hither with them, O Agni, on one chariot or on many chariots, for thy\nhorses are powerful. Bring hither, after thy nature, the thirty and the three\ngods with their wives, and rejoice (in the Soma).\n\n10\\. He is the Hot _ri_ whose sacrifice even the two wide worlds salute over\nand over again for the sake of prosperity. Turned to the east\n[1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:10:1), the two well-established\n[2](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:10:2) (goddesses, Heaven and Earth), the righteous,\ntrue ones stand as at the sacrifice [3](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:10:3) of (Agni)\nthe right-born.\n\n11 = III, 1, 23.\n\n#### NOTES.\n\nThe sane _Ri_ shi and metre.--Verse 1 = TB. II, 8, 2, 5; MS. IV, 14, 3. Verse\n9 = AV. XX, 13, 4.\n\n##### Verse 1.\n\nNote 1. The translation of manana\xc2\xb4 is conjectural, and based only on the\netymology. The passage a\xc2\xb4t it ra\xc2\xb4 _g_ anam manana\xc2\xb4 _h_ ag _ri_ bh _n_ ata, IX,\n70, 3, does not help us much. 'Does not X, 47, 7. stoma _h_ h _ri_ disp _r i_\n_s_ a _h_ manasa va _k_ yamana _h_ , indicate the original reading, manasa va\n_k_ yamanam?' M. M.\n\nNote 2. The sru _k_ a _h_ are called dakshi _n_ av _r i_ta _h_ , I, 144, 1. By\nthe word dakshi _n_ ava\xc2\xb4 _t_ the poet probably intended to designate the ladle\nalso as procuring a Dakshi _n_ a (sacrificial fee) to the priest.\n\np. 246\n\n##### Verse 2.\n\nNote 1. On praya _g_ yu, see M. M., vol. xxxii, p. 335, and Pischel, Ved.\nStudien, I, 98.\n\nNote 2. The flames of Agni.\n\nNote 3. Comp. below, 7, 10. The meaning seems to be: by thy (Agni's) greatness\nwhich is equal to that of Heaven and Earth.\n\n##### Verse 3.\n\nNote 1. I refer ya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ iyasa _h_ , though it is a plural, to Heaven and\nEarth. Comp. Delbruck, Altindische Syntax, 103.\n\n##### Verse 4.\n\nNote 1. The Padapa _th_ a has dhruva _h_. I think it should be dhruve, comp.\nII, 41, 5. dhruve sadasi uttame \xe2\x80\xa6 asate; IX, 40, 2. dhruve sadasi sidati.\n\nNote 2. I. e. Heaven and Earth.\n\nNote 3. \xc3\x82\xc2\xb4skra seems derived from a-sa _k_ (Joh. Schmidt, Kuhn's Zeitschrift,\nXXV, 71).\n\nNote 4. Or 'the two milch-cows which instantly give milk,' if sabar- is to be\nconnected with the Greek \xe1\xbc\x84\xcf\x86\xce\xb1\xcf\x81; comp. Bartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beitrage, XV,\n17.\n\nNote 5. Vish _n_ u is not the only god who is called urugaya, and there is no\nreason therefore why the epithet should not be referred here to Agni.\n\n##### Verse 6.\n\nNote 1. Comp. Lanman, Noun-Inflection, pp. 402, 413.--See below, IV, 2, 3.\n\n##### Verse 7.\n\nNote 1. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 114 seq.\n\nNote 2. Should the accent be apa _h_? Comp. III, 1, 3, note 3.\n\nNote 3. It is very probable that u _s_ adhak (comp. III, 34, 3; VII, 7, 2) is\nan epithet of Agni. We should expect the genitive; u _s_ adhak, which violates\nthe construction, seems\n\np. 247\n\nto stand metri causa. Or is u _s_ adhak an accusative singular neuter, so that\nthe literal translation would be: 'When the gods praised the work, burning in\nthe forests, of the Hot _ri_ '?\n\n##### Verse 8.\n\nNote 1. On u\xc2\xb4ma, comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 223.\n\n##### Verse 10.\n\nNote 1. Comp. above, II, 2, 7.\n\nNote 2. See Windisch in the Festgruss an Boehtlingk, p. 114.\n\nNote 3. There is one syllable above the number; the metre and meaning would be\nall right if we were to read adhvare (for adhvareva): '(the two goddesses)\nstand at the sacrifice,' &c. Prof. Max Muller explains: 'Adhvara\xc2\xb4-iva, like\ntwo sacrifices, like two sacrificial altars, barhis.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 7](sbe46067.htm)\n\n"
