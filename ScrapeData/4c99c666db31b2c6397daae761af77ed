(The light into which the soul enters is) the Self; owing to the subject-\nmatter of the chapter.\n\nBut how can the soul be called 'released,' considering that the clause 'having\nentered into the highest light' speaks of it as within the sphere of what is a\nmere effect? For the word 'light,' according to general usage, denotes\nphysical light. And none who has not passed beyond the sphere of what is\neffected can be released, it being known that whatever is an effect is tainted\nwith evil.--This objection is without force, we reply; because in the passage\nreferred to the word 'light' denotes the Self, in accordance with the subject-\nmatter of the chapter. For as such the highest Self is introduced in the\nwords, 'The Self which is free from sin, old age, death,' &c., and we\ntherefore may not all at once pass over to physical light; incurring thereby\nthe fault of abandoning the topic under discussion and introducing a new one.\nBesides, the word 'light' sometimes denotes the Self, as e.g. in the passage,\n'That the gods meditate on as the light of lights' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4, 16). We\nhave discussed this at length under I, 3, 40.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 4](sbe38321.htm)\n\n"
