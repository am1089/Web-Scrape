[1885], at sacred-\ntexts.com\n\n* * *\n\np. 181\n\n3:7:4\n\n### FOURTH BR\xc3\x82HMA _N_ A.\n\n3:7:4:11\\. Having made a noose, he throws it over (the victim) with (Va _g_.\nS. VI, 8), 'With the noose of sacred order I bind thee, O oblation to the\ngods!' for that rope, forsooth, is Varu _n_ a's: therefore he thus binds it\nwith the noose of sacred order, and thus that rope of Varu _n_ a does not\ninjure it.\n\n3:7:4:22\\. 'Be bold, O man 1!' for at first man dared not 2 to approach it\n(the victim); but now that he thus binds it with the noose of sacred order, as\nan oblation to the gods, man dares to approach it: therefore he says, 'Be\nbold, O man!'\n\n3:7:4:33\\. He then binds it (to the stake) with (Va _g_. S. VI, 9), 'At the\nimpulse of the divine Savit _ri_ , I bind thee with the arms of the A _s_\nvins, with the hands of Pushan, thee agreeable to Agni and Soma!' Even as on\nthat occasion 3, when taking out an oblation for a deity, he assigns it, so\ndoes he now assign it to the two deities. He then sprinkles it,--one and the\nsame, forsooth, is the\n\np. 182\n\nsignificance of sprinkling: he thereby makes it sacrificially pure.\n\n3:7:4:44\\. He sprinkles with, 'For the waters--thee, for the plants!' whereby\nit (the victim) exists, thereby he thus makes it sacrificially pure. For when\nit rains, then plants are produced here on earth; and by eating plants and\ndrinking water that sap originates, and from sap seed, and from seed beasts:\nhence whereby it exists, wherefrom it springs, thereby he thus makes it\nsacrificially pure.\n\n3:7:4:55\\. 'May thy mother grant thee permission, and thy father--;' for it is\nfrom its mother and father that it is born: hence wherefrom it is born,\nthereby he thus makes it sacrificially pure; '--thine own brother, thy fellow\nin the herd;' whereby he means to say, 'whatever kin there is of thine, with\ntheir approval I slay thee.' 'I sprinkle thee, agreeable to Agni and Soma;' he\nthus makes it pure for those two deities for whom he slays it.\n\n3:7:4:66\\. With (Va _g_. S. VI, 10), 'Thou art a drinker of water,' he then\nholds (the lustral water) under (its mouth), whereby he renders it internally\npure. He then sprinkles it underneath (the body), with, 'May the divine waters\nmake it palatable, a true palatable offering to the gods!' he thus makes it\nsacrificially pure all over.\n\n3:7:4:77\\. Thereupon he says (to the Hot _ri_ ), 'Recite to the fire being\nkindled!' when he has made the second libation of ghee 1, and returned (to his\nformer place) without letting the two spoons touch one another 2, he anoints\nthe victim with the (ghee in the)\n\np. 183\n\n_g_ uhu, For the second libation is the head of the sacrifice, and the\nsacrifice here indeed is that victim: hence he thereby puts the head on the\nsacrifice and therefore anoints the victim with the _g_ uhu.\n\n3:7:4:88\\. With 'May thy breath unite with the wind!' he anoints it on the\nforehead; with 'Thy limbs with those worthy of sacrifice' on the shoulders;\nwith 'The lord of sacrifice with (the object of) his prayer!' the loins;\nwhereby he means to say, 'For whatsoever object the animal is slain, do thou\nobtain that!'\n\n3:7:4:99\\. For, indeed, the breath of the victim when slain here passes into\nthe wind: 'Obtain thou that thy breath may pass into the wind!' is what he\nthereby means to say. 'Thy limbs with those worthy of offering' he says,\nbecause it is with its limbs that they sacrifice: 'Obtain thou that they may\nsacrifice with thy limbs' is what he thereby means to say. 'The lord of\nsacrifice with his prayer,' hereby they invoke a blessing on the sacrificer:\n'Obtain thou that through thee they may invoke a blessing on the sacrificer'\nis what he thereby means to say. He then deposits the two spoons and calls for\nthe _S_ rausha _t_ with a view to the Pravara (election of the Hot _ri_ ) 1.\nThe significance of this is the same (as before).\n\n3:7:4:1010\\. Thereupon he calls a second time for the Srausha _t_ , for on\nthis occasion there are two Hot _ri_ s it is with regard to the Maitravaru _n_\na 2 that he now calls for the _S_ rausha _t_. But it is the sacrificer whom\n\np. 184\n\nhe chooses, saying, 'Verily, Agni is the leader of the divine hosts,' for Agni\nis the head of the deities; wherefore he says, 'Verily, Agni is the leader of\nthe divine hosts;'--'this sacrificer of the human;' for that community wherein\nhe sacrifices is behind (inferior to) him; wherefore he says, 'This sacrificer\n(is the head) of the human.' 'May the household of these two shine brightly,\nnot (like a cart yoked) with one bullock, for a hundred winters,--two yoke-\nfellows!' whereby he means to say, 'May their household matters be free from\ncalamities for a hundred years 1.'\n\n3:7:4:1111\\. 'Uniting blessings, not uniting bodies;' whereby he means to say,\n'Unite ye your blessings only, but not also your bodies;' for were they also\nto unite their bodies, Agni (the fire) would burn the sacrificer. Now when\nthis one sacrifices in the fire, he gives gifts to Agni; and whatever blessing\nthe priests here invoke upon the sacrificer, all that Agni accomplishes. Thus\nthey unite only their blessings, but not also their bodies: wherefore he says,\n'Uniting blessings, not uniting bodies.'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[181:1](sbe2630.htm#fr_458) Thus the author appears to take the formula\n'dharsha ma\xcc\x81nusha _h_.' It would rather seem to mean, 'Be bold: [I am (or he,\nthe slaughterer, is)] a man.' Mahidhara interprets, 'May he (the _S_ amit _ri_\n) be bold enough!' Either the Ka _n_ va reading 'dharshan manusha _h_ ' or\nthat of the Taittiriyas 'dharsha manushan' would seem preferable.\n\n[181:2](sbe2630.htm#fr_459) The Ka _n_ va text has 'dh _ri_ sh _n_ oti' for\n'adh _ri_ sh _n_ ot,' which renders it more simple: 'At first the man (the\nslaughterer) dares not approach it, but when he thus binds it, &c.'\n\n[181:3](sbe2630.htm#fr_460) Viz. at the Havirya _g_ _\xc3\xb1_ a; see I, 1, 2, 17.\n\n[182:1](sbe2630.htm#fr_461) For the course of performance, see I, 3, 5, 1\nseq.; I, 4, 4, 1 seq.\n\n[182:2](sbe2630.htm#fr_462) See I, 4, 5, 5.\n\n[183:1](sbe2630.htm#fr_463) See I, 5, 1, 1 seq. (also note to part i, p. 115).\n\n[183:2](sbe2630.htm#fr_464) The Maitravaru _n_ a or Pra _s_ ast _ri_ is the\nHot _ri_ 's chief assistant. He receives, as the badge of his office, the\nstall which the sacrificer p. 184 held while he was consecrated, and has, at\nthe instance of the Adhvaryu, to call on the Hot _ri_ for the offering-\nprayers,--his summons (praisha) beginning with Hota yakshat, 'let the Hot _ri_\nworship or, pronounce the offering-prayer) . . .,'--and occasionally himself\nto pronounce the invitatory prayer.\n\n[184:1](sbe2630.htm#fr_465) See I, 9, 3, 79.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 8, 1.
