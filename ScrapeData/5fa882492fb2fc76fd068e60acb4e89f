He wrote\nCommentaries on the older Vedanta books, and many original works of great\nexcellence, of which this is reckoned to be one.\n\nLike all \xc5\x9aankara's separate works, _The Essence of the Teaching_ is complete\nin itself, containing a survey of the whole of life' from a single standpoint;\nin the present case, from the point of view of pure intellect.\n\nThe moral problem before us, is the liberation of our souls from the idea of\npersonality; and the opening of the door to the life of the universal Self,\nwhich will enter our hearts, and rule them, once the personal idea is put out\nof the way. And there is no more potent weapon for combating the personal idea\nthan the clear and lucid understanding that what we call our personality is,\nin reality, only one of many pictures in the mind, a picture of the body, held\nbefore our consciousness, viewed by it, and therefore external to it. If the\npersonality is a picture in the field of consciousness, it cannot be\nconsciousness itself; cannot be our real\n\np. 146\n\nself; but must necessarily be unreal and transient. We are the ray of\nconsciousness, and not the image of the body which it lights up, and which,\nthus lit Lip, we call our personality. And here we come to one point of the\nhighest interest, in the present work: its central ideas anticipate, almost in\nthe same words, the most original teachings of German philosophy. Hence a\nright understanding of it will bridge over one of the chasms between the East\nand the West, the remote past and the life of today; thus showing, once more,\nthat the mind of man is everywhere the same; that there is but one Soul making\nitself manifest throughout all history.\n\nIt may be enough, here, to point out that German philosophy--the teaching of\nKant, as developed by Schopenhauer--regards each individual as a manifestation\nof the universal Will, a ray of that Will, fallen into manifestation, under\nthe influence of the tendency called the will-towards-life.\n\nThis individualized ray of the universal Will, falling into the intellect,\nbecomes thereby subject to the powers which make for manifestation, and which\nKant analyzed as Causality, Time, and Space. For Kant has shown, with\nadmirable cogency and lucidity, that these so solid-seeming realities are not\nreal at all, but were forms of our thought; mere figments of our intellects.\nWhat we call manifestation, Schopenhauer calls representation; and he has very\nfully developed the idea of the Universe as the resultant of the universal\nWill, manifested through these three forms of representation--Causality, Time,\nand Space.\n\nNow it is quite clear that he calls Universal Will what\n\np. 147\n\n[paragraph continues] \xc5\x9aankara, following the Upanishads, calls the Eternal;\nand that the forms of representation of Schopenhauer's system, correspond to\nthe World-glamor, or Maya, of Indian thought. And it is further clear that the\nwill-toward-life, or desire for sensuous existence, of the one system, is very\nclose to the personal idea, or egotism, of the other.\n\nWhoever is acquainted with the two systems, can point out a further series of\nanalogies; we shall content ourselves with alluding to one. Schopenhauer\ntaught that our salvation lies in denying the personal and selfish will-\ntoward-life, within ourselves, and allowing the Universal Will to supersede\nit;--the very teaching which lies at the heart of Indian thought: the\nsupersession of the individual self by the Self universal, the Self of all\nbeings.\n\nTo turn now from the purely intellectual, to the moral side of the matter. If\nwe consider it well, and watch the working of the powers of life we find\nwithin us, we shall see that all our misery and futility come from this very\nsource, the personal idea--the vanity and selfishness of our own\npersonalities, coming into strife with the equally vain and selfish\npersonalities of others.\n\nThere is not an evil that cannot be traced to this fertile source. Sensuality,\nfor example, with all its attendant crime and pain, is built on two forces,\nboth springing from the personal idea: first, the desire for the stimulus of\nstrong sensation, to keep the sense of the separate, isolated self keen and\nvivid; and then the vanity and foolish admiration of our personal selves, as\npossessors of such abundant means of gratification. Another evil, the lust of\npossessions, is of the same brood;\n\np. 148\n\nand, curiously enough, the root of it is--fear; the cowering fear of the\npersonal self, before the menacing forces of the world; the desperate, and--\ninfallible accompaniment of cowardice--remorselessly cruel determination to\nbuild up a triple rampart of possessions between the personality and the\nmutability of things. The whole cause of the race for wealth, the cursed\nhunger for gold, is a fearful and poltroon longing for security, protection\nfor the personal self; which, indeed, as a mere web of dreams and fancies, is\nin very bad need of protection.\n\nThe last evil, ambition, which is only vanity grown up, is so manifestly of\nthe same color with the others that no special indication of the fact is\nneeded. Thus we see what an immense part of human life, and that, the most\nfutile and pitiable part of it, is built up on so slight a foundation: the\nwholly mythical personality, the web of dreams, the mere image of a body,\nitself unreal, which has usurped a sort of sovereignty over all the powers of\nour wills and minds.\n\nThe whole problem for us is this, and it is one that recurs in every moment of\nlife: to disperse this web of dreams which we call our personality, and so to\nlet the pure and universal Will pour into our hearts, to follow out its own\nexcellent purposes, and manifest its own beneficent powers. And thus we shall\nfor the first time enter into our inheritance; no longer as shadowy and\nmalevolent sprites, raging between earth and heaven, a sorrow to the angels, a\nmockery to the fiends; but rather as undivided parts of the great soul of\nhumanity; of that universal Self, whose own nature is perfect Being, perfect\nConsciousness, perfect Bliss.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: The Song of the Self](cjw21.htm)\n\n"
