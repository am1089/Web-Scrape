Then he said to them all: 'You eat your food, knowing that Vai _s_ vanara\nSelf as if it were many. But he who worships the Vai _s_ vanara Self as a span\nlong, and as 1 identical with himself, he eats food in all worlds, in all\nbeings, in all Selfs.\n\np. 89\n\n2\\. 'Of that Vai _s_ vanara Self the head is Sute _g_ as (having good light),\nthe eye Vi _s_ varupa (multiform), the breath P _ri_ thagvartman (having\nvarious courses), the trunk Bahula (full), the bladder Rayi (wealth), the feet\nthe earth, the chest the altar, the hairs the grass on the altar, the heart\nthe Garhapatya fire, the mind the Anvaharya fire, the mouth the \xc3\x82havaniya\nfire.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[88:1](sbe01112.htm#fr_265) The two words prade _s_ amatra and abhivimana are\ndoubtful. The commentator explains the first in different ways, which are all\nmore or less fanciful. He is measured or known (matra) as Self, p. 89 by means\nof heaven as his head and the earth as his feet, these being the prade _s_ as;\nor, in the mouth and the rest, which are instruments, he is known as without\naction himself; or, he has the length from heaven to earth, heaven and earth\nbeing called prade _s_ a, because they are taught. The interpretation,\nsupported by the _G_ abala _s_ ruti, that prade _s_ a is the measure from the\nforehead to the chin, he rejects. Abhivimana is taken in the same meaning as\nabhimana in the Vedanta, seeing everything in oneself. Vai _s_ vanara is taken\nas the real Self of all beings, and, in the end, of all Selfs, and as thus to\nbe known and worshipped.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: V, 19](sbe01113.htm)\n\n"
