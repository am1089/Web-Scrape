Thus the pra _n_ as.\n\nAfter having taught that Ether and all the other elements are effects, and\nhence have originated, the Sutras had shown that the individual soul, although\nlikewise an effect, does not originate in the sense of undergoing a change of\nessential nature; and had in connexion therewith clearly set forth wherein the\nessential nature of the soul consists. They now proceed to elucidate the\nquestion as to the origination of the instruments of the individual soul, viz.\nthe organs and the vital breath.\n\nThe point here to be decided is whether the organs are effects as the\nindividual soul is an effect, or as ether and the other elements are. As the\nsoul is, thus the pra _n_ as are, the Purvapakshin maintains. That means--as\nthe soul is not produced, thus the organs also are not produced--For the\nlatter point no less than the former is directly stated in Scripture; the\nwording of the Sutra 'thus the pra _n_ as' being meant to extend to the case\nof the pra _n_ as also, the authority of Scripture to which recourse was had\nin the case of the soul.--But what is the scriptural text you mean?\n\n'Non-being, truly this was in the beginning. Here they say, what was that?\nThose _Ri_ shis indeed were that Non-being, thus they say. And who were those\n_Ri_ shis? The pra _n_ as indeed were those _Ri_ shis.' This is the passage\nwhich declares that before the origination of the world the _Ri_ shis existed.\nAs 'pra _n_ a _h_ ' is in the plural, we conclude that what is meant is the\norgans and the vital air. Nor can this text be interpreted to mean only that\nthe pra _n_ as exist for a very long time(but are not uncreated); as we may\ninterpret the texts declaring Vayu and the atmosphere (antariksha) to be\nimmortal: 'Vayu and the atmosphere are immortal'; 'Vayu is the deity that\nnever sets' (B _ri_. Up. II, 3, 3; I, 5, 22). For the clause 'Non-being indeed\nwas\n\np. 569\n\nthis in the beginning' declares that the pra _n_ as existed even at the time\nwhen the entire world was in the pralaya state. Those texts, then, which speak\nof an origination of the pra _n_ as must be explained somehow, just as we did\nwith the texts referring to the origination of the individual soul.\n\nTo this the Siddhantin replies, 'the pra _n_ as also originate in the same way\nas ether, and so on.'--Why?--Because we have scriptural texts directly stating\nthat before creation everything was one, 'Being only this was in the\nbeginning,' 'The Self only was this in the beginning.' And moreover, the text\n'from that there is produced the pra _n_ a and the mind and all organs'(Mu.\nUp. II, 3, 1) declares that the organs originated; they therefore cannot have\nexisted before creation. Nor is it permissible to ascribe a different meaning\nto the texts which declare the origination of the sense-organs--as we may do\nin the case of the texts declaring the origination of the soul. For we have no\ntexts directly denying the origination of the sense-organs, or affirming their\neternity, while we _have_ such texts in the case of the individual soul. In\nthe text quoted by the Purvapakshin, 'Non-being indeed was this in the\nbeginning,' &c., the word pra _n_ a can denote the highest Self only; for from\ntexts such as 'All these beings indeed enter into breath alone, and from\nbreath they arise'( _Kh_. Up. I, 11, 5), the word pra _n_ a is known to be one\nof the designations of the highest Self. And as to the clause 'the pra _n_ as\nindeed are those _Ri_ shis,' we remark that the term _Ri_ shi may properly be\napplied to the all-seeing highest Self, but not to the non-intelligent organs.\n\nBut how then is the plural form 'the _Ri_ shis are the pra _n_ as' to be\naccounted for? This the next Sutra explains.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 2. The scriptural statement of the plural](sbe48300.htm)\n\n"
