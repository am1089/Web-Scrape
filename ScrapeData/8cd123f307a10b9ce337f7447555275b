No images or pictures of him are to be had, though he\nis frequently referred to in the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana as the lord of gold and wealth.\n"Brahm\xc4\x81 had a mental son named Pulastya, who again had a mental son named\nGaviputra Vaisravana (Kuvera). The latter deserted his father, and went to\nBrahm\xc4\x81, who as a reward made him immortal, and appointed him to be the god of\nriches, with Lanka for his capital, and the car Pushpaka for his vehicle. *\nThis car was of immense size, and moved at its owner\'s will at a marvellous\nspeed; R\xc4\x81vana took it by force from Kuvera, at whose death it was restored by\nR\xc4\x81ma to its original possessor.\n\n"Pulastya being incensed at this desertion (of his son Kuvera) reproduced the\nhalf of himself in the form of Vaisravas, who looked upon Vaisravana with\nindignation. The latter strove to pacify his father, and with this view gave\nhim three elegant R\xc4\x81kshas\xc4\xabs to attend on him: Pushpotkat\xc4\x81, who had two sons,\nR\xc4\x81vana and Kumbhakarna; M\xc4\x81lin\xc4\xab, who bore Vibh\xc4\xabshana; and R\xc4\x81k\xc4\x81, who bore Khara\nand S\xc5\xabparnakha. These sons were all\n\np. 389\n\nvaliant, skilled in the Vedas and observers of religious rites, but,\nperceiving the prosperity of Vaisravana, were filled with jealousy. Excepting\nKhara and S\xc5\xabparnakha, they began to practise austerities to propitiate Brahm\xc4\x81,\nand at the end of a thousand years R\xc4\x81vana cut off his own head and threw it as\nan oblation into the fire. Brahm\xc4\x81 appeared to put a stop to their austerities,\nand to offer them boons (except that of immortality). He ordained that R\xc4\x81vana\nshould have heads and shapes at will and be invincible, except by men; that\nKumbhakarna should enjoy a long sleep. Having obtained these powers, R\xc4\x81vana\nexpelled Vaisravana from Lanka. Kuvera retired to Gandam\xc4\x81rdana. R\xc4\x81vana having\nbeen installed as king, and begun to exercise his power tyrannically, the\nRishis resort to Brahm\xc4\x81, who promises that, as R\xc4\x81vana could not be killed by\ngods or asuras, the four-armed Vishnu, the chief of warriors, should by his\n(Brahm\xc4\x81\'s) appointment descend to earth for his destruction." *\n\nThe R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana (Uttara K\xc4\x81nda) \xe2\x80\xa0 makes Kuvera the grandson, not the son, of\nPulastya. In the Krita Yuga the pious Pulastya, being teased with the singing\nand dancing of different damsels, proclaimed that any one of them whom he saw\nnear his hermitage should become a mother. This threat had not been heard by\nthe daughter of Trinavindu, who came near the hermitage, and incurred\nPulastya\'s threatened punishment. Her father, on learning her condition, gave\nher as wife to Pulastya, and she bore him a son named Visravas; who, becoming\na sage, married a daughter of the Muni Bharadvaja, whose son Brahm\xc4\x81, named\nVaisravana (Kuvera). He performed austerities for thousands of years, and\nreceived as a boon from Brahm\xc4\x81 that he should be the\n\np. 390\n\ngod of riches, and one of the guardians of the world. At the suggestion of his\nfather Visravas, he took possession of Lanka for his abode, which was formerly\nbuilt by Visvakarma for the R\xc4\x81kshasas, who through fear of Vishnu had recently\nforsaken it.\n\nA R\xc4\x81kshas prince named Sumali, who had been driven to P\xc4\x81t\xc4\x81la, happening to\nvisit the earth, saw Kuvera travelling in his chariot to visit his father.\nThis leads him to devise a plan by which he might regain his former position.\nHe sends his daughter Kaikasi to woo Visravas; she is kindly received and\nbecomes the mother of R\xc4\x81vana, Kumbhakarna, S\xc5\xabparnakha and Vibhishana. When\nKaikasi saw the splendour of Kuvera, she urges R\xc4\x81vana to resemble him in\nglory; who, in order to effect this, undergoes most severe austerities for a\nthousand years, when Brahm\xc4\x81 grants him as a boon invincibility against all\nbeings more powerful than men, and other gifts. Kuvera on R\xc4\x81vana\'s demand\nyields the city of Lanka.\n\nIt was noticed above that Kuvera was one of the guardians of the world; these\nare commonly said to be four in number. R\xc4\x81ma mentions their names:\n\n"May he whose hands the thunder wield [Indra],  \n Be in the East thy guard and shield:  \n May Yama\'s care the South befriend,  \n And Varuna\'s arm the West defend;  \n And let Kuvera, Lord of Gold,  \n The North with firm protection hold." *\n\n[paragraph continues] When eight guardians are spoken of, the additional four\nare these: Agni has charge of the South-East, Surya of the South-West, Soma of\nthe North-East, and V\xc4\x81yu of the North-West.\n\np. 391\n\nKuvera is called the King of the Y\xc4\x81kshasas--savage beings who, because the\nmoment they were born said, "Let us eat," were called Y\xc4\x81kshasas. These beings\nwere ever on the watch for prey, and ate those they slew in battle.\n\nThroughout the R\xc4\x81m\xc4\x81yana there are brief references to Kuvera as the giver of\nriches, and also to the beauty of his palace and gardens. Thus Bharadv\xc4\x81ja the\nsage, desirous of giving R\xc4\x81ma and Lakshman a fitting reception, said--\n\n"Here let Kuvera\'s garden rise,  \n Which far in Northern Kuru lies;  \n For leaves let cloth and gems entwine,  \n And let its fruit be nymphs divine." *\n\nHis garden is a place "where the inhabitants enjoy a natural perfection,\nattended with complete happiness, obtained without exertion. There is there no\nvicissitude, nor decrepitude, nor death, nor fear; no distinction of virtue\nand vice, none of the inequalities denoted by the words \'best,\' \'worst,\' and\n\'intermediate,\' nor any change resulting from the succession of the four\nYugas. There is neither grief, weariness, anxiety, hunger, nor fear. The\npeople live in perfect health, free from every suffering, for ten or twelve\nthousand years." \xe2\x80\xa0 As Sugriva was sending forth his armies to search for Sita,\nhe thus speaks of this garden to Satabal, the leader of the army of the\nNorth--\n\n"Pursue your onward way, and haste  \n Through the dire horrors of the waste,  \n Until triumphant with delight  \n You reach Kail\xc4\x81sa\'s glittering height.\n\np. 392\n\n[paragraph continues]  There stands a palace decked with gold,  \n For King Kuvera wrought of old,  \n A home the heavenly artist planned,  \n And fashioned with his cunning hand.  \n There lotuses adorn the flood  \n With full-blown flower and opening bud,  \n Where swans and mallards float, and gay  \n Apsarasas * come down to play.  \n There King Vaisravan\'s self, the lord  \n By all the universe adored,  \n Who golden gifts to mortals sends,  \n Lives with the Guhyakas, \xe2\x80\xa0 his friends." \xe2\x80\xa1\n\nAs R\xc4\x81ma and Lakshman were wandering in the forest, they were attacked by a\ngiant named Vir\xc4\x81dha; but as they could not slay him with their weapons, they\nburied him alive, and as a result he regained his proper form. Formerly Kuvera\nhad cursed him, for "loving Rambh\xc4\x81\'s charms too well," to assume the hideous\nform in which R\xc4\x81ma met with him, and the only relief Kuvera would give him\nwas--\n\n"When R\xc4\x81ma, Dasaratha\'s son,  \n Destroys thee, and the fight is won,  \n Thy proper shape once more assume,  \n And heaven again shall give thee room." \xc2\xa7\n\nWhen R\xc4\x81vana had risen to the summit of his power, he made the gods perform\nvarious offices in his house: thus Indra prepared garlands, Agni was his cook,\nSurya gave light by day and Chandra by night, and Kuvera became his cash-\nkeeper.\n\nKuvera married Yakshi or Charvi; and two of his sons, through a curse of the\nsage N\xc4\x81rada, became trees, in which condition they remained until Krishna,\nwhen\n\np. 393\n\nan infant, uprooted them. N\xc4\x81rada met with them in a forest, bathing with their\nwives, in a state of intoxication. The wives, ashamed of themselves, fell at\nN\xc4\x81rada\'s feet and sought for pardon; but as their husbands disregarded the\npresence of the sage, they suffered the full effects of his curse.\n\n![](img/39300.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[388:*](hmvp39.htm#fr_352) "Mah\xc4\x81bh\xc4\x81rata: "Muir, O.
