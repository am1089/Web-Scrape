'Protector of the house, touch them! To the protector of the house svaha!\nProtectress of the\n\np. 223\n\nhouse, touch them! To the protectress of the house svaha! Protector of the\ndoor, touch them! To the protector of the door svaha! Protectress of the door,\ntouch them! To the protectress of the door svaha!'\xc2\x97with (these formulas) he\nputs down four leaves; (then other leaves) with (the formulas), 'Noisy ones,\ntouch them! To the noisy ones svaha! Quivered ones. . . ye that run in the\nrear . . . Minglers (?) . . . Choosers . . . Eaters, touch them! To the eaters\nsvaha!'\xc2\x97\n\n3\\. Then again ten (leaves) with (the formula), 'Divine hosts, touch them! To\nthe divine hosts svaha!'\n\n4\\. Then other ten (leaves) with (the formula), 'Divine hosts that are named\nand that are not named, touch them! To them svaha!'\n\n5. 5 Then he makes a basket of leaves, puts into it a lump of boiled rice with an 'under-spreading' (of \xc3\x82 _g_ ya) and sprinkling (\xc3\x82 _g_ ya) on it, goes outside his pasture-grounds, and hangs (the basket) up at a tree with (the formula), 'Quivered ones, touch it! To the quivered ones svaha!'\n\n6. 6 He then performs worship (before that basket) with (the formula), 'Adoration to the quivered one, to him who wears the quiver! To the lord of the thieves adoration!'\n\n7. 7 With sandal salve, sura and water, unground, fried grains, cow-dung, with a bunch of durva grass, with Udumbara, Pala _s_ a, Sami, Vika\xe1\xb9\x85kata, and\n\np. 224\n\n[paragraph continues] A _s_ vattha (branches), and with a cow-tail he\nbesprinkles his cows, the bull first, with (the words), 'Bring luck! Bring\nluck!' Then (the bull) will bring him luck.\n\n8. 8 He then cooks that mess of sacrificial food, sacred to Kshetrapati (the lord of the field), with milk, sprinkles it (with \xc3\x82 _g_ ya), takes it from the fire, and performs a sacrifice to Kshetrapati on the path where his cows use to go, without a fire, on four or on seven leaves.\n\n9\\. He has him (i.e. the Kshetrapati? an ox representing Kshetrapati?) led (to\nhis place) in the same way as the _s_ ulagava (chap. 8, \xc2\xa7 2).\n\n10. 10 He sacrifices quickly, (for) the god has a strong digestion (?).\n\n11\\. He then performs worship with (the two verses), 'With the lord of the\nfield,' 'Lord of the field' (Taitt. Sa _m_ h. I, 1, 14, 2. 3).\n\n12\\. Of (the remains of that sacrificial food) sacred to Kshetrapati his\nuterine relations should partake, according as the custom of their family is.\n\nEnd of the Third Pa _t_ ala.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[222:1](sbe30081.htm#fr_669) 9, 1. The text has bau _dh_ yavihara, on which\nthe commentary observes, bau _dh_ yani pala _s_ apar _n_ ani, tesha _m_ viharo\nvihara _n_ a _m_ nanade _s_ eshu sthapana _m_ bau _dh_ yavihara _h_ ,\nkarmanama va. The bau _dh_ yavihara is, as its description clearly shows, a\nceremony for propitiating Rudra and his hosts and for averting evil from the\ncattle and the fields. The commentary understands it as forming part of the\n_s_ ulagava described in chap. 8, and with this opinion it would agree very\nwell that no indication of the time at which the bau _dh_ yavihara ought to be\nperformed (such as apuryama _n_ apakshe pu _n_ ye nakshatre) is given. Comp.\nalso \xc3\x82pastamba VII, 20, 5 seq.\n\n[223:5](sbe30081.htm#fr_670) I have translated avadhaya (instead of avadaya),\nas \xc3\x82pastamba VII, 20, 7 reads.\n\n[223:6](sbe30081.htm#fr_671) Taittiriya Sa _m_ hita IV, 5, 3, 2. Of course the\ngod to whom these designations refer is Rudra.\n\n[223:7](sbe30081.htm#fr_672) The commentary explains surodaka as rain-water,\nor as rainwater which has fallen while the sun was shining.\n\n[224:8](sbe30081.htm#fr_673) Mat _ri_ datta says, kshaitrapatya _m_\nkshetrapatidevataka _m_ payasi sthalipakam, &c. The meaning of the expression\n'that (enam) mess of sacrificial food' is doubtful; the commentary says, enam\niti purvapeksham purvavad aupasana evasyapi _s_ rapa _n_ artham.\xc2\x97The last\nwords (on four or on seven leaves) the commentator transfers to the next\nSutra, but he mentions the different opinion of other authorities.\n\n[224:10](sbe30081.htm#fr_674) nurtte _s_ ighra _m_ ya _g_ ate. kuta _h_. yata\n_h_ sa deva _h_ paka _h_ pa _k_ ana _s_ ilas tikshmas (read, tiksh _n_ as)\ntasmat. Mat _ri_ datta.\xc2\x97Possibly Dr. Kirste is right in reading turta _m_ ;\nthe corresponding Sutra of \xc3\x82pastamba has kshipram (VII, 20, 15), and, as the\n_S_ atapatha Brahma _n_ a (VI, 3, 2, 2) observes, 'yad vai kshipra _m_ tat\nturtam.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 4, 10](sbe30082.htm)\n\n"
