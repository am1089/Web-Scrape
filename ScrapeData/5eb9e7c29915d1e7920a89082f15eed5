He (the knower of the Self) knows that highest home of Brahman 2, in which\nall is contained and shines brightly. The wise who, without desiring\nhappiness, worship that Person 3, transcend this seed, (they are not born\nagain.)\n\n2\\. He who forms desires in his mind, is born again through his desires here\nand there. But to him whose desires are fulfilled and who is conscious of the\ntrue Self (within himself) all desires vanish, even here on earth.\n\n3\\. That Self 4 cannot be gained by the Veda, nor by understanding, nor by\nmuch learning. He whom the Self chooses, by him the Self can be gained. The\nSelf chooses him (his body) as his own.\n\n4\\. Nor is that Self to be gained by one who is destitute of strength, or\nwithout earnestness, or without right meditation. But if a wise man strives\nafter it by those means (by strength, earnestness, and right meditation), then\nhis Self enters the home of Brahman.\n\n5\\. When they have reached him (the Self), the sages become satisfied through\nknowledge, they are conscious of their Self, their passions have passed\n\np. 41\n\naway, and they are tranquil. The wise, having reached Him who is omnipresent\neverywhere, devoted to the Self, enter into him wholly.\n\n6\\. Having well ascertained the object of the knowledge of the Vedanta 1, and\nhaving purified their nature by the Yoga 2 of renunciation, all anchorites,\nenjoying the highest immortality, become free at the time of the great end\n(death) in the worlds of Brahma.\n\n7\\. Their fifteen parts 3 enter into their elements, their Devas (the senses)\ninto their (corresponding) Devas 4. Their deeds and their Self with all his\nknowledge become all one in the highest Imperishable.\n\n8\\. As the flowing rivers disappear in the sea 5, losing their name and their\nform, thus a wise man, freed from name and form, goes to the divine Person,\nwho is greater than the great 6.\n\n9\\. He who knows that highest Brahman, becomes even Brahman. In his race no\none is born ignorant of Brahman. He overcomes grief, he overcomes evil; free\nfrom the fetters of the heart, he becomes immortal.\n\n10\\. And this is declared by the following _Ri_ _k_ -verse: 'Let a man tell\nthis science of Brahman to those only who have performed all (necessary) acts,\nwho are versed in the Vedas, and firmly established in (the lower) Brahman,\nwho themselves offer as\n\np. 42\n\nan oblation the one _Ri_ shi (Agni), full of faith, and by whom the rite of\n(carrying fire on) the head has been performed, according to the rule (of the\n\xc3\x82tharva _n_ as).'\n\n11\\. The _Ri_ shi A\xe1\xb9\x85giras formerly told this true (science 1); a man who has\nnot performed the (proper) rites, does not read it. Adoration to the highest\n_Ri_ shis! Adoration to the highest _Ri_ shis!\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[40:2](sbe15021.htm#fr_186) See verse 4.\n\n[40:3](sbe15021.htm#fr_187) The commentator refers purusha to the knower of\nthe Self.\n\n[40:4](sbe15021.htm#fr_188) Ka _th_.
