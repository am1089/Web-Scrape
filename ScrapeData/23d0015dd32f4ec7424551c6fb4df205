From the year to Vayu; on account of non-specification and specification.\n\nIn their description of the path beginning with light the _Kh_ andogas mention\nthe year between the months and the sun, 'from the months to the year, from\nthe year to the sun' ( _Kh_. Up. V, 10, 1); while the Va _g_ asaneyins\nmention, in that very place, the world of the Gods,'from the months to the\nworld of the Gods, from the world of the Gods to the sun' (B _ri_. Up. VI, 2.\n15). Now, as the two paths are identical, we have to supplement each by the\nadditional item given in the other (and the question then arises whether the\norder of the stages be 1. months, 2. year, 3. world of the Gods, 4. sun; or 1.\nmonths, 2. world of the Gods, 3. year, 4. sun). The year and the world of the\nGods are equally entitled--to the place after the months in so far as textual\ndeclaration goes; for both texts say ' _from_ the months.' But we observe that\nthe advance is throughout from the shorter periods of time to the longer ones\n('from the day to the bright fortnight, from the bright fortnight to the six\nmonths of the northern progress'), and as therefore the year naturally\npresents itself to the mind immediately after the six months, we decide that\nthe order is--months, year, world of the Gods, sun.--In another place (B _ri_.\nUp. V, 10) the Va _g_ asaneyins mention the wind as the stage preceding the\nsun ('the wind makes room for him--he mounts upwards; he comes to the sun').\nThe Kaushitakins, on the other hand, place the world of the\n\np. 746\n\nwind subsequent to light, referred to by them as the world of Agni ('Having\nentered on the path of the Gods he comes to the world of Agni, to the world of\nthe wind,' &c., Kau. Up. I, 3). Now in this latter text the fact of the world\nof the wind following upon light is to be inferred only from the succession of\nthe clauses ('to the world of Agni'--'to the world of the wind '), while the\n'upwards' in the text of the Va _g_ asaneyins is a direct statement of\nsuccession given by the text itself; and as this latter order of succession\nhas greater force than the former, we have to place, in the series of stages,\nthe world of Vayu directly before the world of the sun. But above we have\ndetermined that the same place (after the year and before the sun) has to be\nassigned to the world of the Gods also; and hence a doubt arises whether the\nworld of the Gods and Vayu are two different things--the soul of the wise man\npassing by them in optional succession--or one and the same thing--the soul\ncoming, after the year, to Vayu who is the world of the Gods.--They are\ndifferent things, the Purvapakshin says; for they are generally known to be\nso. And there are definite indications in the text that the world of the Gods\nas well as Vayu is to be placed immediately before the sun--this being\nindicated for Vayu by the 'upwards' referred to above, and for the world of\nthe Gods by the ablative case (devalokat) in the _Kh_ and. text, 'from the\nworld of the Gods he goes to the sun'--and as thus there is no difference\nbetween the two, we conclude that the soul passes by them in either order it\nmay choose.--This view the Sutra negatives: 'From the year to Vayu.' The soul,\nhaving departed from the year, comes to Vayu. This is proved 'by non-\nspecification and specification.' For the term 'the world of the Gods' is a\nterm of general meaning, and hence can denote Vayu in so far as being the\nworld of the Gods; while on the other hand the term Vayu specifically denotes\nthat divine being only. The Kaushitakins speak of 'the world of Vayu'; but\nthis only means 'Vayu who at the same time is a world.' That Vayu may be\nviewed as the world of the Gods is confirmed by another scriptural passage,\nviz.\n\np. 747\n\n[paragraph continues] 'he who blows (Vayu) is the houses of the Gods.'--Here\nterminates the adhikara _n_ a of 'Vayu.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 3.
