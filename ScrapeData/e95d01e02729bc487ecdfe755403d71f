A woman's incantation against her rival.\n\n1\\. I have taken unto myself her fortune and her glory, as a wreath off a\ntree. Like a mountain with broad foundation may she sit a long time with her\nparents!  \n2\\. This woman shall be subjected to thee as thy wife, O king Yama; (till\nthen) let her be fixed to the house of her mother, or her brother, or her\nfather!  \n3\\. This woman shall be the keeper of thy house, O king (Yama), and her do we\nmake over to thee! May she long sit with her relatives, until (her hair) drops\nfrom her head!  \n4\\. With the incantation of Asita, of Kasyapa, and of Gaya do I cover up thy\nfortune, as women cover (something) within a chest.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: III, 18.
