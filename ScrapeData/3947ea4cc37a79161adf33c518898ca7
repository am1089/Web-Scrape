Non-division, according to statement.\n\nIs this union with the highest Self to be understood as ordinary 'merging,'\ni.e. a return on the part of the effected thing into the condition of the\ncause (as when the jar is reduced to the condition of a lump of clay), or as\nabsolute non-division from the highest Self, such as is meant in the clauses\npreceding the text last quoted, 'Speech is merged in mind'? &c.--The former\nview is to be adopted; for as the highest Self is the causal substance of all,\nunion with it means the return on the part of individual beings into the\ncondition of that causal substance.--This view the Sutra rejects. Union here\nmeans non-division, i.e. connexion of such kind that those subtle elements are\naltogether incapable of being thought and spoken of as separate from Brahman.\n\np. 738\n\n[paragraph continues] This the text itself declares, since the clause 'warmth\nin the highest Being' is connected with and governed by the preceding clause\n'Speech is merged in mind.' This preceding clause intimates a special kind of\nconnexion, viz. absolute non-separation, and there is nothing to prove that\nthe dependent clause means to express something different; nor is there any\nreason why at the time of the soul's departure those elements should enter\ninto the causal condition; nor is there anything said about their again\nproceeding from the causal substance in a new creation.--Here terminates the\nadhikara _n_ a of 'non-separation.'\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: 16.
