Vena o\xc2\x92erspread  \nthe bright Ones from the summit,  \nDisclosed his deepest nearest revelations, womb of existent  \nand of non-existent.  \n4 In the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, born Only Lord of all  \ncreated being.  \nHe fixed and holdeth up this earth and heaven. Worship  \nwe Ka the God with our oblation.  \n5 The Drop leaped onward through the earth and heaven,  \nalong this place and that which was before it.\n\np. 115\n\nI offer up, throughout the seven oblations, the Drop still  \nmoving to the common dwelling.  \n6 Homage be paid to Serpents unto all of them that are on  \nearth,  \nTo those that dwell in air, to those that dwell in sky be  \nhomage paid.  \n7 To those that are the demons\xc2\x92 darts, to those that live upon  \nthe trees,  \nTo all the Serpents that lie low in holes be adoration paid.  \n8 Or those that are in heaven's bright sphere, or those that  \ndwell in the Sun's beams:  \nSerpents, whose home has been prepared in waters, homage  \nunto them!  \n9 Put forth like a wide-spreading net thy vigour: go like a  \nmighty King with his attendants.  \nThou, following thy swift net, shootest arrows: transfix the  \nfiends with darts that burn most fiercely.  \n10 Forth go in rapid flight thy whirling weapons: follow them  \nclosely glowing in thy fury.  \nSpread with thy tongue the winged flames, O Agni: unfettered  \ncast thy firebrands all around thee.  \n11 Send thy spies forward, fleetest in thy motion: be, ne\xc2\x92er  \ndeceived, the guardian of this people  \nFrom him who, near or far, is bent on evil, and let no  \ntrouble sent from thee o\xc2\x92ercome us.  \n12 Rise up, O Agni, spread thee out before us, burn down our  \nfoes, thou who hast sharpened arrows.  \nHim, blazing Agni! who hath worked us mischief, consume  \nthou utterly like dried-up stubble.  \n13 Rise, Agni, drive off those who fight against us: make  \nmanifest thine own celestial vigour.  \nSlacken the strong bows of the demon-driven: destroy our  \nfoemen whether kin or stranger.  \nI settle thee with Agni's fiery ardour.\n\np. 116\n\n14 Agni is head and height of heaven, the Master of the earth  \nis he:  \nHe quickeneth the waters\xc2\x92 seed.  \nI settle thee with the great strength of Indra.  \n15 Thou art the leader of the rite and region to which with  \nthine auspicious teams thou tendest.  \nThy light-bestowing head to heaven thou liftest, making  \nthy tongue the oblation-bearer, Agni!  \n16 Steady art thou, sustainer, laid by Visvakarman in thy  \nplace.  \nLet not the ocean nor the bird harm thee: unshaking, steady  \nearth.  \n17 Thee let Prajapati settle on the waters\xc2\x92 back, in Ocean's  \ncourse,  \nThee the capacious, widely spread. Thou art the Wide  \nOne: spread thee wide  \n18 Thou art the earth, the ground, thou art the all-sustaining  \nAditi, she who supporteth all the world.  \nControl the earth, steady the earth, do thou the earth no  \ninjury.  \n19 For all breath, out-breath; through-breath, upward-breathing,  \nfor high position, for prescribed observance,  \nMay Agni keep thee safe with great well-being, with the  \nsecurest shelter. As aforetime with Angiras, with that  \nDeity lie steady.  \n20 Upspringing from thine every joint, upspringing from each  \nknot of thine,\n\np. 117\n\nThus with a thousand, Durva! with a hundred do thou  \nstretch us out.  \n21 Thou spreading with a hundred, thou that branched with  \na thousand shoots,  \nThee, such, with our oblation will we worship, O celestial  \nBrick.  \n22 Thy lights, O Agni, in the Sun that with their beams  \no\xc2\x92erspread the sky,\xc2\x97  \nWith all of those assist thou us to-day to light and progeny.  \n23\\. Lights of yours in the Sun, O Gods, or lights that are in  \nkine and steeds,  \nO Indra-Agni, with all those vouchsafe us light, Brihaspati!  \n24 The Far.-Refulgent held the light. The Self-Refulgent held  \nthe light.  \nThee, luminous, may Prajapati settle upon the back of Earth.  \nGive, to all breathing, all the light, to out-breath, to diffusive  \nbreath.  \nThy Sovran Lord is Agni. With that Deity, as with Angiras,  \nlie firmly settled in thy place.  \n25 Madhu and Madhava, the two Spring seasons\xc2\x97thou art  \nthe innermost cement of Agni.  \nMay Heaven and Earth, may Waters, Plants and Agnis  \nhelp, separate, accordant, my precedence.  \nMay all the Fires \xc2\x92twixt heaven and earth, one-minded,  \nwell-fitted, gather round these two Spring seasons,  \nAs the Gods gathering encompass Indra: firm with that  \nDeity, Angiras-like, be seated.  \n26 Thou art Ashadha, Conquering One. Conquer our foemen,  \nconquer thou the men who fain would-fight with us.  \nA thousand manly powers hast thou: so do thou aid and  \nquicken me.\n\np. 118\n\n27 The winds waft sweets, the rivers pour sweets for the man  \nwho keeps the Law:  \nSo may the plants be sweet for us.  \n28 Sweet be the night and sweet the dawns, sweet the terrestrial  \natmosphere:  \nSweet be our Father Heaven to us.  \n29 May the tall tree be full of sweets for us and, and full of  \nsweets the Sun:  \nMay our milch-kine be sweet for us.  \n30 Seat thyself in the deepness of the waters, lest Surya, lest  \nVaisvanara Agni scorch thee.  \nWith wing unclipped, survey created beings: may rain  \nthat cometh down from heaven attend thee.  \n31 He crept across the three heaven-reaching oceans, the Bull  \nof Bricks, the Master of the Waters.  \nClad in the world with his, the Well-Made's, vesture, go  \nwhither those before thee have departed.  \n32 May Heaven and Earth, the Mighty Pair, besprinkle this our  \nsacrifice,  \nAnd feed us full with nourishments.  \n33 Look ye on Vishnu's works whereby the Friend of Indra,  \nclose allied,  \nHath let his holy ways be seen.\n\np. 119\n\n34 Firm art thou, a sustainer. Hence engendered, forth from  \nthese wombs at first came Jatavedas.  \nBy Gayatri, by Trishtup, by Anushtup, may he who knows  \nbear to the Gods oblation.  \n35 Take thou thine ease for food, for store of riches, for might  \nin splendour, and for strength and offspring.  \nThou art all-ruling, independent Ruler: both fountains of  \nSarasvati protect thee!  \n36 O radiant Agni, harness thou thy steeds which are most excellent!  \nThey bear thee as thy spirit wills.  \n37 Yoke, Agni, as a charioteer, thy steeds who best invoke the  \nGods:  \nAs ancient Hotar take thy seat.  \n38 Like rivers our libations flow together, cleansing themselves  \nin inmost heart and spirit.  \nI look upon the flowing streams of butter: the golden reed  \nis in the midst of Agni.  \n39 Thee for the praise-verse, thee for sheen, thee for bright  \nsplendour, thee for light.  \nThis hath become the energetic spirit of all the world and of  \nVaisvanara Agni.  \n40 Agni, all-luminous with light, splendid with splendour, golden  \nOne.  \nGiver of thousands art thou: for a thousand thee.\n\np. 120\n\n41 Balm thou with milk the unborn babe \xc3\x82ditya, wearing all  \nforms, creator of a thousand.  \nSpare, him with heat, nor plot against him: give him a  \nhundred years of life while thou art building.  \n42 The wind's impetuous rush, Varuna's navel! the horse that  \nsprings to life amid the waters!  \nThe rivers\xc2\x92 tawny child, based on the mountain, harm not,  \nO Agni, in the loftiest region.  \n43 Unwasting Drop, red, eager, pressing forward, Agni I worship  \nwith repeated homage.  \nForming thyself with joints in proper order, harm not the  \nCow, Aditi widely ruling!  \n44 Her who is Tvashtar's guardian, Varuna's navel, the Ewe  \nbrought forth from out the loftiest region,  \nThe Asura's mighty thousandfold contrivance, injure not in  \nthe highest sphere, O Agni.  \n45 The Agni who from Agni had his being, from heat of Earth  \nor also heat of Heaven,  \nWhereby the Omnific One engendered creatures, him may  \nthy fierce displeasure spare, O Agni.  \n46 The brilliant presence of the Gods hath risen, the eye of  \nMitra, Varuna, and Agni.  \nThe soul of all that moveth not or moveth, the Sun hath  \nfilled the air, and earth and heaven.  \n47 Injure not, thousand-eyed, while thou art building for sacrifice,  \nthis animal, the biped.\n\np. 121\n\nAccept as pith man's counterfeit the victim, Agni: therewith  \nbuilding thy forms, be settled.  \nLet thy flame reach man's counterfeit: let thy flame reach  \nthe man we hate.  \n48 Harm not this animal whose hooves are solid, the courser  \nneighing in the midst of coursers.  \nI dedicate to thee the forest Gaura: building thy bodies up  \nwith him be settled.  \nLet thy flame reach the Gaura, let thy flame reach him whom  \nwe detest.  \n49 Thousandfold, with a hundred streams, this fountain,  \nexpanded in the middle of the waters,  \nInfinite, yielding butter for the people, harm not, O Agni,  \nin the highest region.  \nThis wild bull of the forest I assign thee: building thy  \nbodies up therewith be settled.  \nLet thy flame reach the wild hull, etc. (as in 48).  \n50 This creature clothed in wool, Varuna's navel, the skin of  \nanimals quadruped and biped,  \nThe first that was produced of Tvashtar's creatures, O Agni,  \nharm not in the highest region.  \nThe forest buffalo do I assign thee: building, etc., as above  \n_mutato mutando_.  \n51 From Agni's warmth the he-goat had his being: he looked  \nat first upon his generator.  \nThereby the Gods at first attained to Godhead: those meet  \nfor worship to the height ascended.  \nThe forest Sarabha do I assign thee: building, etc.  \n52 Do thou, Most Youthful God, protect the men who offer,  \nhear their songs,  \nProtect his offspring and himself.\n\np. 122\n\n53 I set thee in the passage of the waters. I set thee in the  \nswelling of the waters. I set thee in the ashes of the  \nwaters. I set thee in the lustre of the waters. I set  \nthee in the way which waters travel.
