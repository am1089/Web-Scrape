(What scripture says about absence of all specific cognition) refers\neither to deep sleep or union (release); for this is manifested (by the\ntexts).\n\nBy 'entering into one's own Self' is meant dreamless\n\np. 415\n\nsleep; according to the text, 'He is gone to his own Self, he sleeps they say'\n( _Kh_. Up. VI, 8, 1). 'Union' means blissful isolation (final release),\naccording to the text, 'Being Brahman he goes to Brahman' (B _ri_. Up. IV, 4,\n6). What the texts say about absence of specific cognition is said with\nreference to either of those two states, dreamless sleep or final release.--\nHow do we know this?--Because this is 'manifest,' owing to the fact that those\ntwo states form the topic there (where absence of all cognition is mentioned).\nCompare the passages, 'Having risen from out of these elements it perishes\nagain after them. Having departed there is no more knowledge;' 'But where the\nSelf only is all this;' 'Where when asleep he desires no more desires, and\ndreams no more dreams' (B _ri_. Up. II, 4, 12; IV, 5, 15; IV, 3, 19).--Those\npassages, on the other hand, which describe lordly power refer to an\naltogether different condition, which--like the heavenly world and so on--is\nan abode where qualified knowledge produces its results.--Thus there is no\ncontradiction.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: IV, 4, 17](sbe38333.htm)\n\n"
