Janamejaya said :-- O Muni! You told before that the heavenly prostitutes\nsent by Indra in the hermitage of Nara Naraya _n_ a became lustful and desired\nto live with Naraya _n_ a only, whose heart was calm and quiet.\n\n\n\n2\\. At that moment when Naraya _n_ a was about to curse them, his brother Nara\ndesisted him from taking that step.\n\n\n\n3-4. Now I ask you what did that triumphant Naraya _n_ a Muni do, in the\ncritical juncture, when he was repeatedly asked by those prostitutes, sent by\nlndra, to satisfy their lust?\n\n\n\n5\\. O Grand Sire! I am very eager to know the deeds of Naraya _n_ a, leading\nto one\xc2\x92s freedom. Kindly describe in detail and fulfill my wishes.\n\n\n\n6\\. Vyasa said :-- Hear, O king! I am describing to you in detail, what that\nhigh souled son of Dharma did.\n\n\n\n7\\. When Naraya _n_ a Hari was ready to curse them, the Ri _s_ i Nara, seeing\nthis, consoled him and desisted him.\n\n\n\n8\\. Then the great sage, the ascetic son of Dharma, Naraya _n_ a, leaving\naside his anger, began to address them in sweet words with countenance\nsmiling.\n\n\n\n9-10. O Fair women! We have determined to practise asceticism in this life; it\ndoes not therefore behove us to accept any wife; therefore shew your kindness\nunto us and go back to your Heaven. You would better think that those who know\nwhat is religion, they never desire to break the vow of another.\n\n\n\n11\\. O beautiful eyed ones! In the sexual pleasure, it is the delightful\nfeeling of passionate joy that is requisite; and we are wanting in those\nfeelings; then how can we effect that union?\n\n\n\n12\\. No action can come out of no cause; this is all clear. The poets say that\nthe sexual power and pleasure, is the feeling, the mental attitude that\ncorresponds; and that is the only thing, that lasts. And we have no desire for\nthat.\n\n\n\n13\\. However my limbs are all very graceful, I am very fortunate and blessed\nin this world, otherwise how can I be the object of your sincere love towards\nme.\n\n\n\n14\\. You all are very fortunate; therefore do now show this mercy unto me \xc2\x93do\nnot break my vow.\xc2\x94 I pray now that, in a subsequent birth, I may become your\nhusband.\n\n\n\n15-16. O large eyed fair women! In the twenty-eighth Dvapara Yuga, I will\ncertainly incarnate on earth to effect the purpose of the Devas; then you all\nalso would respectively incarnate as the daughters of kings and would also\nbecome my wives.\n\n\n\np. 312\n\n\n\n17\\. Naraya _n_ a thus consented to marry them in some other next birth; and\nconsoling them, made them go back to their Heavens. They also abandoned their\nmental disquietude and, on reaching back to Heavens, they explained everything\nto Indra.\n\n\n\n18-19. Indra heard (from these heavenly women) what the two two Ri _s_ is did\nand saw before him Urvas\xc2\x92i and other women created by Naraya _n_ a from his\nthighs, etc., and began to extol the merits of the high souled Naraya _n_ a.\n\n\n\n20\\. Indra said :-- O! How wonderful is the patience of the Muni? What is the\nwonderful influence of his Tapas! Oh! He has created, by the sheer force of\nhis Tapas, Urvas\xc2\x92i and these fair women, unrivalled for their beauties, from\nhis thighs.\n\n\n\n21\\. The Lord of the Devas thus extolled his merits and became freed from his\nanxieties. The virtuous Naraya _n_ a, too, devoted himself to the practice of\nhis Tapasya.\n\n\n\n23\\. O king! Thus I have described to you, in detail, all the wonderful\naccounts regarding Nara Naraya _n_ a.\n\n\n\nO Superior in the descendants of Bharata! These two Nara and Naraya _n_ a\nafterwards incarnated themselves, due to Bhrigu\xc2\x92s curse as the two great\nheroes Arju _n_ a and Kri _sn_ a, to relieve the burden of the earth.\n\n\n\n24\\. The king said :-- O respect giving Muni! Now describe in detail the life\nof the Avatar Kri _sn_ a and dispel my mental doubt.\n\n\n\n25-26. O best of the Munis! Why were Vasudeva and Devaki, who were chosen by\nthe very powerful Hari and Ananta as their parents, doomed to so many miseries\nand afflictions. Why had these parents to remain for good many years in the\nprison of Kamsa, who pleased directly by their Tapasya that Bhagavan\nJanardana.\n\n\n\n27\\. Why did Kri _sn_ a taking his birth at Mathura, go to Gokula? Also what\nwas his object to go to Dvarka, situated in the ocean, when he killed the\nenemy Kamsa?\n\n\n\n28\\. Also why did his father, mother and relatives, leave their old holy\nplaces of residences and go abroad to live in a wretched old country?\n\n\n\n29-31. Why was the Yadu race destroyed by the curse from a Brahma _n_ a! How\ndid S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a Vasudeva leave finally His body after He had relieved the\nburden of the earth and was about to enter into His Heaven? The evildoers of\nthe earth were slain by Kri _sn_ a and Arju _n_ a, of unequalled prowess;  but\nhow was it, that those who plundered the wives of S\xc2\x92ri Hari, were not at all\npunished by Him?\n\n\n\np. 313\n\n\n\n32-33. The great personages Bhi _s_ ma, Dro _n_ a, Kar _n_ a, the king\nValhika, Vira _t_ a, Vikar _n_ a, Dhri _st_ adyumna, the king Somadatta were\ndestroyed for relieving the burden of the earth; and the plunderers were\nacquitted! Kindly explain the cause of this.\n\n\n\n34\\. How was it that those chaste and virtuous wives of S\xc2\x92ri Kri _sn_ a go\ninto troubles at the latter end of their lives? There has arisen a doubt in my\nmind on this point.\n\n\n\n35\\. Why did the virtuous Vasudeva leave his mortal coil owing to the death of\nhis sons and why did he die an unusual death?\n\n\n\n36\\. O best of Munis! The Pa _nd_ avas were devoted to Kri _sn_ a and they\nwere religious; they had to suffer so many troubles!\n\n\n\n37\\. Why was Draupadi so very unfortunate and she had to suffer so much\nmiseries, and pains, who was born of Lak _s_ mi from amidst the sacrificial\nplace and from the altar.\n\n\n\n38-39. Why did Duhs\xc2\x92asan drag Her by Her hairs while She was in Her\nmenstruation period, in the hall of audience and why was it that Sindhu Raj\nJayadratha, the king of Sindhu, gave Her exceedingly mental troubles?\n\n\n\n40\\. Why was it that Her five sons residing in Her house were killed by\nAs\xc2\x92vaththama? What was the cause that the son of Subhadra had to die in the\nbattlefield?\n\n\n\n41\\. Why did the king Kamsa kill the six sons of Devaki; and why was it that\nS\xc2\x92ri Hari who was capable of averting the Fate did not at all prevent that?\n\n\n\n42\\. What a wonder is this that in the matters of Brahma _n_ a\xc2\x92s curse toward\nthe Jadavas, their being killed in the Prabhasa, the total extermination the\nJadu race and the plundering of His wives, why did He allow Fate to do these\ngreat momentous things?\n\n\n\n43\\. If He was the all-powerful God and He Himself Naraya _n_ a, that why did\nHe incessantly act like a slave towards Ugrasena.\n\n\n\nN.B. -- Ugrasena was the king of Mathura and father of Kamsa. He was deposed\nby his son; but Kri _sn_ a after having slain Kamsa restored him to the\nthrone.\n\n\n\n44-45. All these bring doubt in our minds regarding Naraya _n_ a Muni that His\ndeeds are always like those of ordinary persons; why did his pleasures and\npains resemble those of ordinary human beings? Were he God, why his actions\nwere not Godly? (i.e., superhuman)\n\n\n\n46\\. Therefore dost Thou describe in detail all the Divine Leelas (playful\nsports) done by Hari of superhuman powers in this world.\n\n\n\n47\\. O Best of Munis! When one\xc2\x92s longevity expires, one dies; then I cannot\nunderstand what glory was manifested by Hari in killing the Daityas? For Fate\nKilled them; not Hari.\n\n\n\np. 314\n\n\n\n48\\. Was not the doing of Hari like a thief when he stole away the Lady Rukmi\n_n_ i and fled quickly to his own place.\n\n\n\n49\\. What did it mean when he fled to Dvarka city, and quitted his own highly\nprosperous town Mathura simply out of the fear of Jarasandha?\n\n\n\n50\\. Did not anybody at that time recognise that he was S\xc2\x92ri Bhagavan Hari? O\nRespected One! Were he Bhagavan, why did He hide himself in Vraja? Please\nexplain the cause to me.\n\n\n\n51\\. O Muni! These and many other doubts always exist in my mind; you are the\nbest of the Dvijas and blessed; I pray, dost thou remove these doubts.\n\n\n\n52-53. O best of Munis! Another doubt exists and is not dispelled and that is\nsecret. Was not the taking of the five husbands by Panchali for herself\nshameful and despised by the society? The good manners and doings are always\nconsidered by the learned as the proofs of virtue. Why did those Pa _nd_ avas,\nthen, capable in every respect, do this thing like brutes?\n\n\n\n54\\. And what did Bhisma do living like a Deva in this world? May I ask, was\nhis act of producing two sons by a widow and thus preserving his line of\nancestors worthy of his name?\n\n\n\n55\\. The religious sanction advocated by the Munis \xc2\x93Procreate sons in any way\nwhatsoever\xc2\x94 is simply shameful. Fie to this religious sanction.\n\n\n\nHere ends the 17th Chapter in the 4th Book of S\xc2\x92ri mad Devi Bhagavatam of\n18000 verses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa on the questions asked by Janamejaya.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 18](bk04ch18.htm)\n\n'
