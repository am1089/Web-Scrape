Indra saw this seven-versed (hymn, suitable) for making good what\nis deficient 1, for reducing what is redundant, and for perfecting what is\nimperfect. And, indeed, after building the fire-altar, one is (still) apt to\nget into trouble, or to stumble, or what not. Now, when _S_ yapar _n_ a\nSayakayana heard this, he ventured upon this performance.\n\n9:5:2:22\\. Now, there is here a perfecting of three things,--the perfecting of\nthe fire-altar, the perfecting of\n\np. 275\n\nhim who has it built for him, and the perfecting of him who builds it.\n\n9:5:2:33\\. Thus, when he reverently stands by (the altar) with this (hymn),\neverything is thereby made good 1 for him that, knowing or unknowing, he\neither does in excess, or does not carry to the end, in this building of the\naltar--in short, whatever was not secured for him. And whatever wish there is\nin that anush _t_ ubh verse 2, that he secures even now; and, moreover, he\nthereby keeps off the fiends, the Rakshas, from this sacred work, and they do\nnot wreck him, whilst uttering imprecations. Wherefore one who knows this may\nreadily build a fire-altar even for an enemy, for he is able to gain the\nbetter of him.\n\n9:5:2:44\\. [He approaches reverently the fire-altar 3, with, Va _g_. S. XVIII,\n68-74], \'For mighty strength that smiteth V _ri_ tra, and for victory in\nbattle, we call thee hither, O Indra!\' \'O much-invoked Indra, crush thou the\nhandless Ku _n_ aru, lurking here, together with the Danus; and with might\nsmite thou the footless V _ri_ tra, the ever-growing mocker!\' thus he\nreverently stands by (the fire) with the first two (verses) relating to the\nslaying of V _ri_ tra. For now the gods, having warded off V _ri_ tra, evil,\nperformed this rite freed from evil; and in like manner does the Sacrificer,\nhaving warded off V _ri_ tra, evil, now perform this rite freed from evil.\n\np. 276\n\n9:5:2:55\\. \'Scatter thou our scorners, O Indra 1!\'Like a terrible, creeping\nbeast, dwelling in the mountains, hast thou come from the farthest distance:\nhaving sharpened thy pointed, piercing thunderbolt 2, O Indra, beat thou off\nthe foes, and scatter the spurners!\' thus with the second two (verses)\nrelating to (Indra) Vim _ri_ dh 3. For now the gods, having warded off the\nspurners, evil, performed this rite freed from evil; and in like manner does\nthe Sacrificer now, having warded off the spurners, evil, now perform this\nrite freed from evil.\n\n9:5:2:66\\. \'May Agni Vai _s_ vanara come forward from afar to our help, to\nhear our hymns of praise!\'--\'Sought after in the sky, sought after on earth,\nAgni, sought after, hath entered all the plants: Agni Vai _s_ vanara, sought\nafter, may guard us from injury by day and by night!\' thus with the third two\n(verses) relating to (Agni) Vai _s_ vanara. For now the gods, having, by Vai\n_s_ vanara, burnt out evil, performed this rite, freed from evil; and in like\nmanner does the . Sacrificer now, by Vai _s_ vanara, burn out evil, and\nperform this rite freed from evil.\n\n9:5:2:77\\. \'May we obtain this wish, O Agni, with thy help! may we obtain, O\nwealthy one, wealth with abundant heroes! striving for strength, may we obtain\nstrength; may we obtain undecaying glory, O thou ever-young!\' thus with one\n(verse) containing wishes. For now\n\np. 277\n\nthe gods, having, by the six-versed (hymn), warded off evil, made once for\nall, by the one wish-holding (verse), all (objects of) wishes their own; and\nin like manner does the Sacrificer now, having, by the six-versed (hymn),\nwarded off evil, make once for all, by the one wish-holding (verse), all\nwishes his own.\n\n9:5:2:88\\. It is (a hymn) of seven verses,--the fire-altar consists of seven\nlayers, (and there are) seven seasons, seven regions, seven worlds of the\ngods, seven stomas, seven p _ri_ sh _th_ a (samans), seven metres, seven\ndomestic animals, seven wild ones, seven vital airs in the head, and whatever\nelse there is of seven kinds, relating to deities and relating to the self,--\nall that he thereby secures. They become equal to the Anush _t_ ubh 1, for the\nAnush _t_ ubh is speech, and it is by speech that he secures for him (Agni)\nall that which is not yet secured for him.\n\n9:5:2:99\\. \'Let him approach (the fire-altar) with an eight-versed (hymn)!\'\nsay some;--\'with (Va _g_. S. XVIII, 75), "We thereby offer unto thee thy wish,\nreverently approaching thee with open hands: with holiest mind and peaceful\nthought offer thou sacrifice unto the gods as priest, O Agni!" thus with a\nsecond wish-holding one,--and the seven foregoing ones, that makes eight,--the\nGayatri consists of eight syllables, and Agni is of Gayatra nature: as great\nas Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus secures for him\n\np. 278\n\nwhatsoever is not yet secured for him; and thus, moreover, the two deities 1\nreceive the same (amount) for their share.\' Let him, however, not do so, for\nsurely those seven (verses) are (equal to) eight anush _t_ ubh (verses), and\nthus he even therein obtains whatever wished-for object there is in the eight-\nversed (hymn).\n\n9:5:2:1010\\. With (verses) addressed to Indra and Agni he approaches (the\nfire);--the fire-altar belongs to Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as\ngreat as is his measure, by so much he thus gains for him whatever has not\nbeen gained for him. And Indra and Agni are all the gods, and the fire-altar\nbelongs to (or Agni is) all the deities: as great as Agni is, as great as is\nhis measure, by so much he thus gains for him whatever has not been gained for\nhim.\n\n9:5:2:1111\\. Now some make this (hymn) the opening rite of every performance,\nsaying, \'Freed from evil, we must perform this sacred work!\' And others,\nindeed, say, \'Let him approach reverently (each) layer when it is covered with\nsoil, for therein that (layer) becomes whole and complete.\' Let him, then, do\nas he chooses. So much as to the building; now as to the non-building.\n\n9:5:2:1212\\. Verily, there are three oceans,--the Fire-altar (being the ocean)\nof Ya _g_ us-formulas, the Mahavrata (-saman) 2 that of Samans (hymn-tunes),\nand the Mahad uktham (Great Litany 3) that of _Ri_ _k_ (verses). Whoever\nperforms these (three rites) for another\n\np. 279\n\nperson causes these oceans to dry up for himself, and after them, thus drying\nup, the metres 1 dry up for him; and after the metres the world; and after the\nworld his own self; and after his own self his children and cattle: indeed, he\nwho performs these for another person becomes poorer day after day.\n\n9:5:2:1313\\. And he who, not having performed these (rites) for another\nperson, were to officiate in the performance even of all other sacrifices, for\nhim the metres again replenish themselves from out of those oceans, and after\nthe metres the world, and after the world his own self, and after his own self\nhis children and cattle: indeed, he who does not perform those rites for\nanother person, becomes more prosperous day after day. For, indeed, these\n(rites) are his divine, immortal body; and he who performs them for another\nperson, makes over to another his divine body, and a withered trunk is all\nthat remains.\n\n9:5:2:1414\\. Now, some (say), \'Having performed them for another person, they\neither perform them for themselves or cause them to be performed again: this\nis the atonement.\' But let him not do this, for it would be as if one were to\nwater a withered trunk; it would rot and die: let him know that there is no\natonement for such an one.\n\n9:5:2:1515\\. And _S_ a _n_ _d_ ilya once upon a time said--Tura Kavasheya once\nbuilt a fire-altar for the gods at Karoti. The gods asked him, \'Sage, seeing\nthat they declare the building of the fire-altar not to be conducive to\nheaven, why then hast thou built one?\'\n\n16\\. He said, \'What is conducive to heaven,\n\np. 280\n\nand what is not conducive thereto? The Sacrificer is the body of the\nsacrifice, and the officiating priests are the limbs; and, surely, where the\nbody is there are the limbs; and where the limbs are there is the body. And,\nverily, if the priests have no place in heaven, then the Sacrificer has none,\nfor both are of the same world. But let there be no bargaining as to\nsacrificial fees, for by bargaining the priests are deprived of their place in\nheaven.\'\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[274:1](sbe4344.htm#fr_514) Viz. in the building of the fire-altar; literally,\nfor the obtainment of the deficient.\n\n[275:1](sbe4344.htm#fr_515) Literally, obtained.\n\n[275:2](sbe4344.htm#fr_516) Viz. the first of the seven verses ( _Ri_ g-veda\nIII, 37, 1).\n\n[275:3](sbe4344.htm#fr_517) According to Katy. _S_ r. XVII, 7, 1, this\nceremony should take place on the completion of each layer, after it has been\ncovered with loose earth; cf. [paragraph 11](sbe4344.htm#9:5:2:11).\n\n[276:1](sbe4344.htm#fr_518) For the complete verse, see IV, 6, 4, 4.\n\n[276:2](sbe4344.htm#fr_519) Thus Mahidhara.\n\n[276:3](sbe4344.htm#fr_520) That is, the repeller of spurners, or enemies.\n\n[277:1](sbe4344.htm#fr_521) The seven verses consist of two Gayatris (twenty-\nfour syllables each), four Trish _t_ ubhs (forty-four each), and one Anush _t_\nubh (thirty-two syllables). Whilst the two Gayatris are sixteen syllables\nshort of two Anush _t_ ubhs, the four Trish _t_ ubhs have forty-eight\nsyllables in excess of four Anush _t_ ubhs. Hence the seven verses consist of\n8 \xc3\x97 32 syllables, or eight Anush _t_ ubhs.\n\n[278:1](sbe4344.htm#fr_522) Viz. Indra and Agni, having each four verses\naddressed to them.\n\n[278:2](sbe4344.htm#fr_523) See [p. 282](sbe4345.htm#page_282), note\n[5](sbe4345.htm#fn_525).\n\n[278:3](sbe4344.htm#fr_524) See [p. 110](sbe4324.htm#page_110), note\n[3](sbe4324.htm#fn_202); [p. 111](sbe4324.htm#page_111), note\n[1](sbe4324.htm#fn_203).\n\n[279:1](sbe4344.htm#fr_525) That is, the Vedic texts.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: X, 1, 1.
