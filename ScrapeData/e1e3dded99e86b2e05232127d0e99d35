 \n\np. 205  \n\nThrough all the forest clear and high  \nResounds the shrill cicala's cry.  \nHark how the kite above us moans,  \nAnd calls her young in piteous tones;  \nSo may my hapless mother be  \nStill mourning in her home for me.  \nThere mounted on that lofty Sal  \nThe loud Bhringraj  1 repeats his call:  \nHow sweetly now he tunes his throat  \nResponsive to the Koil's note.  \nOr else the bird that now has sung  \nMay be himself the Koil's young,  \nLinked with such winning sweetness are  \nThe notes he pours irregular.  \nSee, round the blooming Mango clings  \nThat creeper with her tender rings,  \nSo in thy love, when none is near,  \nThine arms are thrown round me, my dear.'  \n  Thus in his joy he cried; and she,  \nSweet speaker, on her lover's knee,  \nOf faultless limb and perfect face,  \nGrew closer to her lord's embrace.  \nReclining in her husband's arms,  \nA goddess in her wealth of charms,  \nShe filled his loving breast anew  \nWith mighty joy that thrilled him through.  \nHis finger on the rock he laid,  \nWhich veins of sanguine ore displayed,  \nAnd painted o'er his darling's eyes  \nThe holy sign in mineral dyes.  \nBright on her brow the metal lay  \nLike the young sun's first gleaming ray,  \nAnd showed her in her beauty fair  \nAs the soft light of morning's air.  \nThen from the Kes'ar's laden tree  \nHe picked fair blossoms in his glee,  \nAnd as he decked each lovely tress,  \nHis heart o'erflowed with happiness.  \nSo resting on that rocky seat  \nA while they spent in pastime sweet,  \nThen onward neath the shady boughs  \nWent Rama with his Maithil spouse.  \nShe roaming in the forest shade  \nWhere every kind of creature strayed  \nObserved a monkey wandering near,  \nAnd clung to Rama's arm in fear.  \nThe hero Rama fondly laced  \nHis mighty arms around her waist,  \nConsoled his beauty in her dread,  \nAnd scared the Monkey till he fled.  \nThat holy mark of sanguine ore  \nThat gleamed on Sita's brow before,  \nShone by that close embrace impressed  \nUpon the hero's ample chest.  \nThen Sita, when the beast who led  \nThe monkey troop, afar had fled,  \nLaughed loudly in light-hearted glee  \nThat mark on Rama's chest to see.  \n\nA clump of bright As'okas fired  \nThe forest in their bloom attired:  \nThe restless blossoms as they gleamed  \nA host of threatening monkeys seemed.  \nThen Sita thus to Rama cried,  \nAs longingly the flowers she eyed:  \n'Pride of thy race, now let us go  \nWhere those As'oka blossoms grow.'  \nHe on his darling's pleasure bent  \nWith his fair goddess thither went  \nAnd roamed delighted through the wood  \nWhere blossoming As'okas stood,  \nAs S'iva with Queen Uma roves  \nThrough Himavan's majestic groves.  \nBright with purpureal glow the pair  \nOf happy lovers sported there,  \nAnd each upon the other set  \nA flower-inwoven coronet.  \nThere many a crown and chain they wove  \nOf blooms from that As'oka grove,  \nAnd in their graceful sport the two  \nFresh beauty o'er the mountain threw.  \nThe lover let his love survey  \nEach pleasant spot that round them lay,  \nThen turned they to their green retreat  \nWhere all was garnished, gay, and neat.  \nBy brotherly affection led,  \nSumitra's son to meet them sped,  \nAnd showed the labours of the day  \nDone while his brother was away.  \nThere lay ten black-deer duly slain  \nWith arrows pure of poison stain,  \nPiled in a mighty heap to dry,  \nWith many another carcass nigh.  \nAnd Lakshman's brother saw, o'erjoyed,  \nThe work that had his hands employed,  \nThen to his consort thus he cried:  \n'Now be the general gifts supplied.'  \nThen Sita, fairest beauty, placed  \nThe food for living things to taste,  \nAnd set before the brothers meat  \nAnd honey that the pair might eat.  \nThey ate the meal her hands supplied,  \nTheir lips with water purified:  \nThen Janak's daughter sat at last  \nAnd duly made her own repast.  \nThe other venison, to be dried,  \nPiled up in heaps was set aside,  \nAnd Rama told his wife to stay  \nAnd drive the flocking crows away.  \nHer husband saw her much distressed  \nBy one more bold than all the rest,  \nWhose wings where'er he chose could fly,  \nNow pierce the earth, now roam the sky.  \nThen Rama laughed to see her stirred  \nTo anger by the plaguing bird:  \nProud of his love the beauteous dame  \nWith burning rage was all aflame.  \nNow here, now there, again, again  \nShe chased the crow, but all in vain,  \nEnraging her, so quick to strike  \n\np. 206  \n\nWith beak and wing find claw alike:  \nThen how the proud lip quivered, how  \nThe dark frown marked her angry brow!  \nWhen Rama saw her cheek aglow  \nWith passion, he rebuked the crow.  \nBut bold in impudence the bird,  \nWith no respect for Rama's word,  \nFearless again at Sita flew:  \nThen Rama's wrath to fury grew.  \nThe hero of the mighty arm  \nSpoke o'er a shaft the mystic charm,  \nLaid the dire weapon on his bow  \nAnd launched it at the shameless crow.  \nThe bird, empowered by Gods to spring  \nThrough earth itself on rapid wing,  \nThrough the three worlds in terror fled  \nStill followed by that arrow dread.  \nWhere'er he flew, now here now there,  \nA cloud of weapons filled the air.  \nBack to the high-souled prince he fled  \nAnd bent at Rama's feet his head,  \nAnd then, as Sita looked, began  \nHis speech in accents of a man:  \n'O pardon, and for pity's sake  \nSpare, Rama, spare my life to take!  \nWhere'er I turn, where'er I flee,  \nNo shelter from this shaft I see.'  \n\nThe chieftain heard the crow entreat  \nHelpless and prostrate at his feet,  \nAnd while soft pity moved his breast,  \nWith wisest speech the bird addressed:  \n'I took the troubled Sita's part,  \nAnd furious anger filled my heart.  \nThen on the string my arrow lay  \nCharmed with a spell thy life to slay.  \nThou seekest now my feet, to crave  \nForgiveness and thy life to save.  \nSo shall thy prayer have due respect:  \nThe suppliant I must still protect.  \nBut ne'er in vain this dart may flee;  \nYield for thy life a part of thee,  \nWhat portion of thy body, say,  \nShall this mine arrow rend away?  \nThus far, O bird, thus far alone  \nOn thee my pity may be shown.  \nForfeit a part thy life to buy:  \n'Tis better so to live than die.'  \nThus Rama spoke: the bird of air  \nPondered his speech with anxious care,  \nAnd wisely deemed it good to give  \nOne of his eyes that he might live.  \nTo Raghu's son he made reply:  \n'O Rama, I will yield an eye.  \nSo let me in thy grace confide  \nAnd live hereafter single-eyed.'  \nThen Rama charged the shaft, and lo,  \nFull in the eye it smote the crow.  \nAnd the Videhan lady gazed  \nUpon the ruined eye amazed.  \nThe crow to Rama humbly bent,  \nThen where his fancy led he went.  \nRama with Lakshman by his side  \nWith needful work was occupied.  \n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[204:1b](ry174.htm#fr_374) This canto is allowed, by Indian commentators, to\nbe an interpolation.
