These two\ncustoms were obviously based upon divergent beliefs regarding the future state\nof existence. A Varuna hymn makes reference to the "house of clay", which\nsuggests that among some of the Aryan tribes the belief originally obtained\nthat the spirits of the dead hovered round the place of sepulture. Indeed, the\ndread of ghosts is still prevalent in India; they are supposed to haunt the\nliving until the body is burned.\n\nThose who practised the cremation ceremony in early times appear to have\nconceived of an organized Hades, to which souls were transferred through the\nmedium of fire, which drove away all spirits and demons who threatened\nmankind. Homer makes the haunting ghost of Patroklos exclaim, "Never again\nwill I return from Hades when I have received my meed of fire". 1 The Vedic\nworshippers\n\np. 39\n\nof Agni burned their dead for the same reason as did the ancient Greeks. "When\nthe remains of the deceased have been placed on the funeral pile, and the\nprocess of cremation has commenced, Agni, the god of fire, is prayed not to\nscorch or consume the departed, not to tear asunder his skin or his limbs,\nbut, after the flames have done their work, to convey to the fathers the\nmortal who has been presented to him as an offering. Leaving behind on earth\nall that is evil and imperfect, and proceeding by the paths which the fathers\ntrod, invested with a lustre like that of the gods, it soars to the realms of\neternal light in a car, or on wings, and recovers there its ancient body in a\ncomplete and glorified form; meets with the forefathers who are living in\nfestivity with Yama; obtains from him, when recognized by him as one of his\nown, a delectable abode, and enters upon more perfect life, which is crowned\nwith the fulfilment of all desires, is passed in the presence of the gods, and\nemployed in the fulfilment of their pleasure." 1\n\nAgni is the god who is invoked by the other deities, "Make straight the\npathways that lead to the gods; be kind to us, and carry the sacrifice for\nus". 2\n\nIn this connection, however, Professor Macdonell says, "Some passages of the\n_Rigveda_ distinguish the path of the fathers or dead ancestors from the path\nof the gods, doubtless because cremation appeared as a different process from\nsacrifice". 3\n\nIt would appear that prior to the practice of cremation a belief in Paradise\nultimately obtained: the dead walked on foot towards it. Yama, King of the\nDead, was the first man. 4 Like the Aryan pioneers who discovered the\n\np. 40\n\n[paragraph continues] Punjab, he explored the hidden regions and discovered\nthe road which became known as "the path of the fathers".\n\nTo Yama, mighty king, be gifts and homage paid.  \nHe was the first of men that died, the first to brave  \nDeath\'s rapid rushing stream, the first to point the road  \nTo heaven, and welcome others to that bright abode.  \n                         _Sir M. Monier Williams\' translation_. 1\n\nProfessor Macdonell gives a new rendering of a Vedic hymn 2 in which Yama is\nreferred to as follows:\n\nHim who along the mighty heights departed,  \nHim who searched and spied the path for many,  \nSon of Vivasvat, gatherer of the people,  \nYama the king, with sacrifices worship.  \n                                       _Rigveda_ , x, 14. 1.\n\nYama and his sister Yami, the first human pair, are identical with the Persian\nYima and Yimeh of Avestan literature; they are the primeval "twins", the\nchildren of Vivasvat, or Vivasvant, in the _Rigveda_ and of Vivahvant in the\n_Avesta_. _Yama_ signifies twin, and Dr. Rendel Harris, in his researches on\nthe Greek Dioscuri cult, shows that among early peoples the belief obtained\nwidely that one of each pair of twins was believed to be a child of the sky.\n"This conjecture is borne out by the name of Yama\'s father (Vivasvant), which\nmay well be a cult-epithet of the bright sky, \'shining abroad\' (from the root\n_vas_ , \'to shine\')". . . In the _Avesta_ \'Yima, the bright\' is referred to:\nhe is the Jamshid of Fitzgerald\'s Omar. 3\n\nYima, the Iranian ruler of Paradise, is also identical with Mitra (Mithra),\nwhose cult "obtained from 200-400 A.D. a world-wide diffusion in the Roman\nEmpire,\n\n\n\n[![THE KAILASA TEMPLE OF SHIVA, ELLORA](tn/04000.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/04000.jpg)  \nTHE KAILASA TEMPLE OF SHIVA, ELLORA  \n\n\n\np. 41\n\nand came nearer to monotheism than the cult of any other god in paganism". 1\n\nProfessor Moulton wonders if the Yama myth "owed anything to Babylon?" It is\npossible that the worshippers of Agni represented early Iranian beliefs, and\nthat the worshippers of Mitra, Varuna, and the twins (Yama and Yima and the\ntwin Aswins) were influenced by Babylonian mythology as a result of contact,\nand that these opposing sects were rivals in India in early Vedic times.\n\nIn one of the hymns 2 Yami is the wooer of her brother Yama. She declares that\nthey were at the beginning intended by the gods to be husband and wife, but\nYama replies:\n\n"Who has sure knowledge of that earliest day? Who has seen it with his eyes\nand can tell of it? Lofty is the law of Mitra and Varuna; how canst thou dare\nto speak as a temptress?"  \n                         Arnold\'s translation.\n\nIn the Vedic "land of the fathers", the shining Paradise, the two kings Varuna\nand Yama sit below a tree. Yama, a form of Mitra, plays on a flute and drinks\nSoma with the Celestials, because Soma gives immortality. He gathers his\npeople to him as a shepherd gathers his flock: indeed he is called the "Noble\nShepherd". He gives to the faithful the draught of Soma; apparently\nunbelievers were destroyed or committed to a hell called Put. Yama\'s\nmessengers were the pigeon and the owl; he had also two brindled watch-dogs,\neach with four eyes. The dead who had faithfully fulfilled religious\nordinances were addressed:\n\n                        Fear not to pass the guards--  \nThe four-eyed brindled dogs--that watch for the departed. p. 42  \nReturn unto thy home, O soul! Thy sin and shame  \nLeave thou behind on earth; assume a shining form--  \nThine ancient shape--refined and from all taint set free.  \n                       _Sir M. Monier Williams\' translation_. 1\n\nYama judged men as Dharma-rajah, "King of righteousness"; he was Pitripati,\n"lord of the fathers"; Samavurti, "the impartial judge"; Kritana, "the\nfinisher"; Antaka, "he who ends life"; Samana, "the leveller", &c.\n\nIn post-Vedic times he presided over a complicated system of Hells; he was\nDandadhara, "the wielder of the rod or mace". He had a noose with which to\nbind souls; he carried out the decrees of the gods, taking possession of souls\nat their appointed time.\n\nIn one of the _Brahmanas_ death, or the soul which Death claims as his own, is\n"the man in the eye". The reflection of a face in the pupil of the eye was\nregarded with great awe by the early folk; it was the spirit looking forth. We\nread, "Now that man in yonder orb (of the sun) and that man in the right eye\ntruly are no other than Death; his feet have stuck fast in the heart, and\nhaving pulled them out, he comes forth; and when he comes forth then that man\ndies; whence they say of him who has passed away, \' _he has been cut off_ \'\n(life or life-string has been severed)". 2\n\nYama might consent to prolong the life of one whose days had run out, on\ncondition that another individual gave up part of his own life in\ncompensation; he might even agree to restore a soul which he had bound to\ncarry away, in response to the appeal of a mortal who had attained to great\npiety. The Vedic character of Yama survives sometimes in Epic narrative even\nafter cremation\n\np. 43\n\nhad become general. The following two touching and beautiful stories,\npreserved in _Mahabharata_ , are probably very ancient Aryan folk tales which\nwere cherished by the people and retold by the poets, who attached to them\nlater religious beliefs and practices.\n\n### THE BRAHMAN AND HIS BRIDE\n\nOnce upon a time Menaka, the beautiful Apsara (celestial fairy), who is\nwithout shame or pity, left beside a hermitage her new-born babe, the daughter\nof the King of Gandharvas (celestial elves). A pious Rishi, named Sthula-\nkesha, found the child and reared her. She was called Pramadarva, and grew to\nbe the most beautiful and most pious of all young women. Ruru, the great\ngrandson of Bhrigu, looked upon her with eyes of love, and at the request of\nhis sire, Pramati, the virgin was betrothed to the young Brahman.\n\nIt chanced that Pramadarva was playing with her companions a few days before\nthe morning fixed for the nuptials. As her time had come, she trod upon a\nserpent, and the death-compelling reptile bit her, whereupon she fell down in\na swoon and expired. She became more beautiful in death than she had been in\nlife.\n\nBrahmans assembled round the body of Pramadarva and sorrowed greatly. Ruru\nstole away alone and went to a solitary place in the forest where he wept\naloud. "Alas!" he cried, "the fair one, whom I love more dearly than ever,\nlieth dead upon the bare ground. If I have performed penances and attained to\ngreat ascetic merit, let the power which I have achieved restore my beloved to\nlife again."\n\nSuddenly there appeared before Ruru an emissary from the Celestial regions,\nwho spake and said: "Thy\n\np. 44\n\nprayer is of no avail, O Ruru. That one whose days have been numbered can\nnever get back her own life again. Thou shouldst not therefore abandon thine\nheart to grief. But the gods have decreed a means whereby thou canst receive\nback thy beloved."\n\nSaid Ruru: "Tell me how I can comply with the will of the Celestials, O\nmessenger, so that I may be delivered from my grief."\n\nThe messenger said: "If thou wilt resign half of thine own life to this\nmaiden, [Pramadarva](errata.htm#1), she will rise up again."\n\nSaid Ruru: "I will resign half of my own life so that my beloved may be\nrestored unto me."\n\nThen the king of the Gandharvas and the Celestial emissary stood before\nDharma-rajah (Yama) and said: "If it be thy will, O Mighty One, let Pramadarva\nrise up endowed with a part of Ruru\'s life."\n\nSaid the Judge of the Dead: "So be it."\n\nWhen Dharma-rajah had spoken thus, the serpent-bitten maiden rose from the\nground, and Ruru, whose life was curtailed for her sake, obtained the sweetest\nwife upon earth. The happy pair spent their days deeply devoted to each other,\nawaiting the call of Yama at the appointed time. 1\n\n### STORY OF SAVITRI\n\nThere was once a fair princess in the country of Madra, and her name was\nSavitri. Be it told how she obtained the exalted merit of chaste women by\nwinning a great boon from Yama.\n\nSavitri was the gift of the goddess Gayatri, 2 wife of\n\np. 45\n\n[paragraph continues] Brahma, the self-created, who had heard the prayers and\nreceived the offerings of Aswapati, the childless king of Madra, when he\npractised austere penances so that he might have issue. The maiden grew to be\nbeautiful and shapely like to a Celestial; her eyes had burning splendour, and\nwere fair as lotus leaves; she resembled a golden image; she had exceeding\nsweetness and grace.\n\nIt came to pass that Savitri looked with eyes of love upon a youth named\nSatyavan "the Truthful". Although Satyavan dwelt in a hermitage, he was of\nroyal birth. His father was a virtuous king, named Dyumatsena, who became\nblind, and was then deprived of his kingdom by an old enemy dwelling nigh to\nhim. The dethroned monarch retired to the forest with his faithful wife and\nhis only son, who in time grew up to be a comely youth.\n\nWhen Savitri confessed her love to her sire, the great sage Narada, who sat\nbeside him, spoke and said: "Alas! the princess hath done wrong in choosing\nfor her husband this royal youth Satyavan. He is comely and courageous, he is\ntruthful and magnanimous and forgiving, he is modest and patient and without\nmalice; honour is seated upon his forehead; he is possessed of every virtue.\nBut he hath one defect, and no other. He is endued with short life; within a\nyear from this day he must die, for so hath it been decreed; within a year\nYama, god of the dead, will come for him."\n\nSaid the king unto his daughter: "O Savitri, thou hast heard the words of\nNarada. Go forth, therefore, and choose for thyself another lord, for the days\nof Satyavan are numbered."\n\nThe beautiful maiden made answer unto her father the king, saying: "The die is\ncast; it can fall but once; once only can a daughter be given away by her\nsire; once only can a woman say, \' _I am thine_ \'. I have chosen\n\np. 46\n\nmy lord; once have I chosen, nor can I make choice a second time. Let his life\nbe brief or be long, I must now wed Satyavan."\n\nSaid Narada: "O king, the heart of thy daughter will not waver; she will not\nbe turned aside from the path she hath selected. I therefore approve of the\nbestowal of Savitri upon Satyavan."\n\nThe king said: "As thou dost advise, so must I do ever, O Narada, because that\nthou art my preceptor. Thee I cannot disobey."\n\nThen said Narada: "Peace be with Savitri! I must now depart. May blessings\nattend upon all of you!"\n\nThereafter Aswapati, the royal sire of Savitri, went to visit Dyumatsena, the\nblind sire of Satyavan, in the forest, and his daughter went with him.\n\nSaid Dyumatsena: "Why hast thou come hither?" Aswapati said: "O royal sage,\nthis is my beautiful daughter Savitri. Take thou her for thy daughter-in-law."\n\nSaid Dyumatsena: "I have lost my kingdom, and with my wife and my son dwell\nhere in the woods. We live as ascetics and perform great penances. How will\nthy daughter endure the hardships of a forest life?"\n\nAswapati said: "My daughter knoweth well that joy and sorrow come and go and\nthat nowhere is bliss assured. Accept her therefore from me."\n\nThen Dyumatsena consented that his son should wed Savitri, whereat Satyavan\nwas made glad because he was given a wife who had every accomplishment.\nSavitri rejoiced also because she obtained a husband after her own heart, and\nshe put off her royal garments and ornaments and clad herself in bark and red\ncloth.\n\nSo Savitri became a hermit woman. She honoured Satyavan\'s father and mother,\nand she gave great joy to\n\np. 47\n\nher husband with her sweet speeches, her skill at work, her subdued and even\ntemper, and especially her love. She lived the life of the ascetics and\npractised every austerity. But she never forgot the dread prophecy of Narada\nthe sage; his sorrowful words were always present in her secret heart, and she\ncounted the days as they went past.\n\nAt length the time drew nigh when Satyavan must cast off his mortal body. When\nhe had but four days to live, Savitri took the _Tritatra_ vow of three nights\nof sleepless penance and fast.\n\nSaid the blind Dyumatsena: "My heart is grieved for thee, O my daughter,\nbecause the vow is exceedingly hard."\n\nSavitri said: "Be not sorrowful, saintly father, I must observe my vow without\nfail."\n\nSaid Dyumatsena: "It is not meet that one like me should say, \'Break thy vow,\'\nrather should I counsel, \'Observe thy vow.\'"\n\nThen Savitri began to fast, and she grew pale and was much wasted by reason of\nher rigid penance. Three days passed away, and then, believing that her\nhusband would die on the morrow, Savitri spent a night of bitter anguish\nthrough all the dark and lonely hours.\n\nThe sun rose at length on the fateful morning, and she said to herself, " _To-\nday is the day_." Her face was bloodless but brave; she prayed in silence and\nwith fervour and offered oblations at the morning fire; then she stood before\nher father-in-law and her mother-in-law in reverent silence with joined hands,\nconcentrating her senses. All the hermits of the forest blessed her and said:\n"Mayest thou never suffer widowhood."\n\nSaid Savitri in her secret heart: "So be it." Dyumatsena spoke to her then,\nsaying: "Now that\n\np. 48\n\nthy vow hath been completed thou mayest eat the morning meal."\n\nSaid Savitri: "I will eat when the sun goes down."\n\nHearing her words Satyavan rose, and taking his axe upon his shoulder, turned\ntowards the distant jungle to procure fruits and herbs for his wife, whom he\nloved. He was strong and self-possessed and of noble seeming.\n\nSavitri spoke to him sweetly and said: "Thou must not go forth alone, my\nhusband. It is my heart\'s desire to go with thee. I cannot endure to-day to be\nparted from thee."\n\nSaid Satyavan: "It is not for thee to enter the dark-some jungle; the way is\nlong and difficult, and thou art weak on account of thy severe penance. How\ncanst thou walk so far on foot?"\n\nSavitri laid her head upon his bosom and said: "I have not been made weary by\nmy fast. Indeed I am now stronger than before. I will not feel tired when thou\nart by my side. I have resolved to go with thee: do not therefore seek to\nthwart my wish--the wish and the longing of a faithful wife to be with her\nlord."\n\nSaid Satyavan: "If it is thy desire to accompany me I cannot but gratify it.\nBut thou must ask permission of my parents lest they find fault with me for\ntaking thee through the trackless jungle."\n\nThen Savitri spoke to the blind sage and her husband\'s mother and said:\n"Satyavan is going towards the deep jungle to procure fruits and herbs for me,\nand also fuel for the sacrificial fires. It is my heart\'s wish to go also, for\nto-day I cannot endure to be parted from him. Fain, too, would I behold the\nblossoming woods."\n\nSaid Dyumatsena: "Since thou hast come to dwell with us in our hermitage thou\nhast not before asked\n\np. 49\n\nanything of us. Have thy desire therefore in this matter, but do not delay thy\nhusband in his duties."\n\nHaving thus received permission to depart from the hermitage, Savitri turned\ntowards the jungle with Satyavan, her beloved lord. Smiles covered her face,\nbut her heart was torn with secret sorrow.\n\nPeacocks fluttered in the green woodland through which they walked together,\nand the sun shone in all its splendour in the blue heaven.\n\nSaid Satyavan with sweet voice: "How beautiful are the bright streams and the\nblossoming trees!"\n\nThe heart of Savitri was divided into two parts: with one she held converse\nwith her husband while she watched his face and followed his moods; with the\nother she awaited the dread coming of Yama, but she never uttered her fears.\n\nBirds sang sweetly in the forest, but sweeter to Savitri was the voice of her\nbeloved. It was very dear to her to walk on in silence, listening to his\nwords.\n\nSatyavan gathered fruits and stored them in his basket. At length he began to\ncut down the branches of trees. The sun was hot and he perspired. Suddenly he\nfelt weary and he said: "My head aches; my senses are confused, my limbs have\ngrown weak, and my heart is afflicted sorely. O silent one, a sickness hath\nseized me. My body seems to be pierced by a hundred darts. I would fain lie\ndown and rest, my beloved; I would fain sleep even now."\n\nSpeechless and terror-stricken, the gentle Savitri wound her arms about her\nhusband\'s body; she sat upon the ground and she pillowed his head upon her\nlap. Remembering the words of Narada, she knew that the dread hour had come;\nthe very moment of death was at hand. Gently she held her husband\'s head with\n\np. 50\n\ncaressing hands; she kissed his panting lips; her heart was beating fast and\nloud. Darker grew the forest and it was lonesome indeed.\n\nSuddenly an awful Shape emerged from the shadows. He was of great stature and\nsable hue; his raiment was blood-red; on his head he wore a gleaming diadem;\nhe had red eyes and was fearsome to look upon; he carried a noose. . . . The\nShape was Yama, god of death. He stood in silence, and gazed upon slumbering\nSatyavan.\n\nSavitri looked up, and when she perceived that a Celestial had come nigh, her\nheart trembled with sorrow and with fear. She laid her husband\'s head upon the\ngreen sward and rose up quickly: then she spake, saying, "Who art thou, O\ndivine One, and what is thy mission to me?"\n\nSaid Yama: "Thou dost love thy husband; thou art endued also with ascetic\nmerit. I will therefore hold converse with thee. Know thou that I am the\nMonarch of Death. The days of this man, thy husband, are now spent, and I have\ncome to bind him and take him away."\n\nSavitri said: "Wise sages have told me that thy messengers carry mortals away.\nWhy, then, O mighty King, hast thou thyself come hither?"\n\nSaid Yama: "This prince is of spotless heart; his virtues are without number;\nhe is, indeed, an ocean of accomplishments. It would not be fitting to send\nmessengers for him, so I myself have come hither."\n\nThe face of Satyavan had grown ashen pale. Yama cast his noose and tore out\nfrom the prince\'s body the soul-form, which was no larger than a man\'s thumb;\nit was tightly bound and subdued.\n\nSo Satyavan lost his life; he ceased to breathe; his body became unsightly; it\nwas robbed of its lustre and deprived of power to move.\n\np. 51\n\nYama fettered the soul with tightness, and turned abruptly towards the south;\nsilently and speedily he went upon his way. . . .\n\nSavitri followed him. . . . Her heart was drowned in grief. She could not\ndesert her beloved lord. . . . She followed Yama, the Monarch of Death.\n\nSaid Yama: "Turn back, O Savitri. Do not follow me. Perform the funeral rites\nof thy lord. . . . Thine allegiance to Satyavan hath now come to an end: thou\nart free from all wifely duties. Dare not to proceed farther on this path."\n\nSavitri said: "I must follow my husband whither he is carried or whither he\ngoeth of his own will. I have undergone great penance. I have observed my vow,\nand I cannot be turned back. . . . I have already walked with thee seven\npaces, and the sages have declared that one who walketh seven paces with\nanother becometh a companion. Being thus made thy friend, I must hold converse\nwith thee, I must speak and thou must listen. . . . I have attained the\nperfect life upon earth by performing my vows and by reason of my devotion\nunto my lord. It is not meet that thou shouldest part me from my husband now,\nand prevent me from attaining bliss by saying that my allegiance to him hath\nended and another mode of life is opened to me."\n\nSaid Yama: "Turn back now. . . . Thy words are wise and pleasing indeed;\ntherefore, ere thou goest, thou canst ask a boon of me and I will grant it.\nExcept the soul of Satyavan, I will give thee whatsoever thou dost desire."\n\nSavitri said: "Because my husband\'s sire became blind, he was deprived of his\nkingdom. Restore his eyesight, O mighty One."\n\nSaid Yama: "The boon is granted. I will restore the\n\np. 52\n\nvision of thy father-in-law. . . . But thou hast now grown faint on this\ntoilsome journey. Turn back, therefore, and thy weariness will pass away."\n\nSavitri said: "How can I be weary when I am with my husband? The fate of my\nhusband will be my fate also; I will follow him even unto the place whither\nthou dost carry him. . . . Hear me, O mighty One, whose friendship I cherish!\nIt is a blessed thing to behold a Celestial; still more blessed is it to hold\nconverse with one; the friendship of a god must bear great fruit."\n\nSaid Yama: "Thy wisdom delighteth my heart. Therefore thou canst ask of me a\nsecond boon, except the life of thy husband, and it will be granted thee."\n\nSavitri said: "May my wise and saintly father-in-law regain the kingdom he\nhath lost. May he become once again the protector of his people."\n\nSaid Yama: "The boon is granted. The king will return to his people and be\ntheir wise protector. . . . Turn back now, O princess; thy desire is\nfulfilled."\n\nSavitri said: "All people must obey thy decrees; thou dost take away life in\naccordance with divine ordinances and not of thine own will. Therefore thou\nart called Yama--he that ruleth by decrees. Hear my words, O divine One. It is\nthe duty of Celestials to love all creatures and to award them according to\ntheir merit. The wicked are without holiness and devotion, but the saintly\nprotect all creatures and show mercy even unto their enemies."\n\nSaid Yama: "Thy wise words are like water to a thirsty soul. Ask of me\ntherefore a third boon, except thy husband\'s life, and it will be granted unto\nthee."\n\nSavitri said: "My sire, King Aswapati, hath no son. O grant that a hundred\nsons may be born unto him."\n\nSaid Yama: "A hundred sons will be born unto thy\n\n\n\n[![YAMA AND SAVITRI<br> <i>From a painting by Nanda Lall Bose</i><br> \\(By\npermission of the Indian Society of Oriental Art, Calcutta](tn/05200.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/05200.jpg)  \nYAMA AND SAVITRI  \n_From a painting by Nanda Lall Bose_  \n(By permission of the Indian Society of Oriental Art, Calcutta  \n\n\n\np. 53\n\nroyal sire. Thy boon is granted. . . . Turn back, therefore, O princess; thou\ncanst not come farther. Long is the path thou hast already travelled."\n\nSavitri said: "I have followed my husband and the way hath not seemed long.\nIndeed, my heart desireth to go on much farther. Hear my words, O Yama, as\nthou dost proceed on thy journey. Thou art great and wise and powerful; thou\ndost deal equally with all human creatures; thou art the lord of justice. . .\n. One cannot trust oneself as one can trust a Celestial; therefore, one\nseeketh to win the friendship of a Celestial. It is meet that one who seeketh\nthe friendship of a Celestial should make answer to his words."\n\nSaid Yama: "No mortal hath ever spoken unto me as thou hast spoken. Thy words\nare indeed pleasing, O princess. I will grant thee even a fourth boon, except\nthy husband\'s life, ere thou dost depart."\n\nSavitri said: "May a century of sons be born unto my husband and me so that\nour race may endure. O grant me this, the fourth boon, thou Mighty One."\n\nSaid Yama: "I grant unto thee a century of sons, O princess; they will be wise\nand powerful and thy race will endure. . . . Be without weariness now, O lady,\nand turn back; thou hast come too far already."\n\nSavitri said: "Those who are pious must practise eternal morality, O Yama. The\npious uphold the universe. The pious hold communion with the pious only, and\nare never weary; the pious do good unto others nor ever expect any reward. A\ngood deed done unto the righteous is never thrown away; such an act doth not\nentail loss of dignity nor is any interest impaired. Indeed, the doing of good\nis the chief office of the righteous, and the righteous therefore are the true\nprotectors of all."\n\np. 54\n\nSaid Yama: "The more thou dost speak, the more I respect thee, O princess. O\nthou who art so deeply devoted unto thy husband, thou canst now ask of me some\nincomparable boon."\n\nSavitri said: "O mighty One, thou bestower of boons, thou hast already\npromised what cannot he fulfilled unless my husband is restored unto me; thou\nhast promised me a century of sons. Therefore, I ask thee, O Yama, to give me\nback Satyavan, my beloved, my lord. Without him, I am as one who is dead;\nwithout him, I have no desire for happiness; without him I have no longing\neven for Heaven; I will have no desire to prosper if my lord is snatched off;\nI cannot live without Satyavan. Thou hast promised me sons, O Yama, yet thou\ndost take away my husband from mine arms. Hear me and grant this boon: Let\nSatyavan be restored to life so that thy decree may be fulfilled."\n\nSaid Yama: "So be it. With cheerful heart I now unbind thy husband. He is\nfree. . . . Disease cannot afflict him again and he will prosper. Together you\nwill both have long life; you will live four hundred years; you will have a\ncentury of sons and they will be kings, and their sons will be kings also."\n\nHaving spoken thus, Yama, the lord of death, departed unto his own place. And\nSavitri returned to the forest where her husband\'s body lay cold and ashen-\npale; she sat upon the ground and pillowed his head upon her lap. Then\nSatyavan was given back his life. . . . He looked upon Savitri with eyes of\nlove; he was like to one who had returned from a long journey in a strange\nland.\n\nSaid Satyavan: "Long was my sleep; why didst thou not awaken me, my beloved? .\n. . Where is that dark One who dragged me away?"\n\np. 55\n\nSavitri said: "Yama hath come and gone, and thou hast slept long, resting thy\nhead upon my lap, and art now refreshed, O blessed one. Sleep hath forsaken\nthee, O son of a king. If thou canst rise up, let us now depart hence for the\nnight is already dark. . . ."\n\nSatyavan rose up refreshed and strong. He looked round about and perceived\nthat he was in the midst of the forest. Then he said: "O fair one, I came\nhither to gather fruit for thee, and while I cut down branches from the trees\na pain afflicted me. I grew faint, I sank upon the ground, I laid my head upon\nthy lap and fell into a deep slumber even whilst thou didst embrace me. Then\nit seemed to me that I was enveloped in darkness, and that I beheld a sable\nOne amidst great effulgence. . . Was this a vision or a reality, O fairest and\ndearest?"\n\nSavitri said: "The darkness deepens. . . . I will tell thee all on the morrow.\n. . . Let us now find our parents, O prince. The beasts of the night come\nforth; I hear their awesome voices; they tread the forest in glee; the howl of\nthe jackal maketh my heart afraid." 1\n\nSaid Satyavan: "Darkness hath covered the forest with fear; we cannot discover\nthe path by which to return home."\n\nSavitri said: "A withered tree burneth yonder. I will gather sticks and make a\nfire and we will wait here until day."\n\nSaid Satyavan: "My sickness hath departed and I would fain behold my parents\nagain. Never before have I spent a night away from the hermitage. My mother is\nold and my father also, and I am their crutch. They will now be afflicted with\nsorrow because that we have not returned."\n\np. 56\n\nSatyavan lifted up his arms and lamented aloud, but Savitri dried his tears\nand said: "I have performed penances, I have given away in charity, I have\noffered up sacrifices, I have never uttered a falsehood. May thy parents be\nprotected by virtue of the power which I have obtained, and may thou, O my\nhusband, be protected also.\n\nSaid Satyavan: "O beautiful one, let us now return to the hermitage."\n\nSavitri raised up her despairing husband. She then placed his left arm upon\nher left shoulder and wound her right arm about his body, and they walked on\ntogether. . . . At length the fair moon came out and shone upon their path.\n\nMeanwhile Dyumatsena, the sire of Satyavan, had regained his sight, and he\nwent with his wife to search for his lost son, but had to return to the\nhermitage sorrowing and in despair. The sages comforted the weeping parents\nand said: "Savitri hath practised great austerities, and there can be no doubt\nthat Satyavan is still alive."\n\nIn time Satyavan and Savitri reached the hermitage, and their own hearts and\nthe hearts of their parents were freed from sorrow.\n\nThen Savitri related all that had taken place, and the sages said: "O chaste\nand illustrious lady, thou hast rescued the race of Dyumatsena, the foremost\nof kings, from the ocean of darkness and calamity."\n\nOn the morning that followed messengers came to Dyumatsena and told that the\nmonarch who had deprived him of his kingdom was dead, having fallen by the\nhand of his chief minister. All the people clamoured for their legitimate\nruler. Said the messengers: "Chariots await thee, O king. Return, therefore,\nunto thy kingdom."\n\np. 57\n\nGreat was their wonder to find that Dyumatsena was no longer blind.\n\nSo the king was restored to his kingdom, in accordance with the boon which\nSavitri had obtained from Yama. And sons were in time born unto her father.\nThus did the gentle Savitri, by reason of her great piety, raise from misery\nto high fortune the family of her husband and her own father also. She was the\nrescuer of all; the bringer of happiness and prosperity. . . . He who heareth\nthe story of Savitri will never endure misery again. . . .\n\n\n\nThe beauties of Yama\'s heaven are sung by the sage Narada in the great epic\npoem _Mahabharata_. 1 "Listen to me," he says. "In that fair domain it is\nneither too hot nor too cold. Life there is devoid of sorrow; age does not\nbring frailties, and none ever hunger or thirst; it is without wretchedness,\nor fatigue, or evil feelings. Everything, whether celestial or human, that the\nheart seeks after is found there. Sweet are the juicy fruits, delicious the\nfragrance of flowers and tree blossoms, and waters are there, both cold and\nhot, to give refreshment and comfort. Nymphs dance and sing to the piping of\ncelestial elves, and merry laughter ever blends with the strains of alluring\nmusic.\n\n"The Assembly House of Yama, which was made by Twashtri, hath splendour equal\nto the sun; it shines like burnished gold. There the servants of the Lord of\nJustice measure out the allotted days of mortals. Great rishis and ancestors\nawait upon Yama, King of the Pitris (fathers), and adore him. Sanctified by\nholiness, their shining bodies are clad in swan-white garments, and decked\nwith many-coloured bracelets and golden ear-rings. Sweet sounds, alluring\nperfumes, and brilliant\n\np. 58\n\nflower garlands make that building ever pleasant and supremely blest. Hundreds\nof thousands of saintly beings worship the illustrious King of the Pitris.\n\n"The heaven of Indra was constructed by the great artisan-god himself. Like a\nchariot it can be moved anywhere at will. The Assembly House has many rooms\nand seats, and is adorned by celestial trees. Indra sits there with his\nbeautiful queen, wearing his crown, with gleaming bracelets on his upper arms;\nhe is decked with flowers, and attired in white garments. He is waited upon by\nbrilliant Maruts, and all the gods and the rishis and saints, whose sins have\nbeen washed off their pure souls, which are resplendent as fire. There is no\nsorrow, or fear, or suffering in Indra\'s abode, which is inhabited by the\nspirits of wind and thunder, fire and water, plants and clouds, and planets\nand stars, and the spirits also of Prosperity, Religion, Joy, Faith, and\nIntelligence. Fairies and elves (Apsaras and Gandharvas) dance and sing there\nto sweet music; feats of skill are performed by celestial battle heroes,\nauspicious rites are also practised. Divine messengers come and go in\ncelestial chariots, looking bright as Soma himself.\n\nThe heaven of Varuna was constructed by Vishwakarman (Twashtri) within the\nsea. Its walls and arches are of pure white, and they are surrounded by\ncelestial trees, made of sparkling jewels, which always blossom and always\nbear fruit. In the many-coloured bowers beautiful and variegated birds sing\ndelightful melodies. In the Assembly House, which is also of pure white, there\nare many rooms and many seats. Varuna, richly decked with jewels and golden\nornaments and flowers, is throned there with his queen. Adityas 1 wait upon\nthe\n\n\n\n[![THE CITY OF THE GODS, PALITANA](tn/05800.jpg)  \nClick to enlarge](img/05800.jpg)  \nTHE CITY OF THE GODS, PALITANA  \n\n\n\np. 59\n\nlord of the waters, as also do hooded snakes (Nagas) with human heads and\narms, and Daityas and Danavas (giants and demons) who have taken vows and have\nbeen rewarded with immortality. All the holy spirits of rivers and oceans are\nthere, and the holy spirits of lakes and springs and pools, and the\npersonified forms of the points of the heavens, the ends of the earth, and the\ngreat mountains. Music and dances provide entertainment, while sacred hymns\nare sung in praise of Varuna."\n\nThese heavens recall the Grecian "Islands of the Blest" and the Celtic\nOtherworld, where eternal summer reigns, trees bear blossoms and fruit\ncontinually, and there is no wasting with age. Indra\'s Assembly House is\nslightly reminiscent of the Teutonic Valhal, but is really more like the\ngardens of the underworld Hela. The Indian heroes do not feast on pork like\nthose of Teutonic and Celtic myth; in the Assembly House of Kuvera, god of\nwealth, however, fat and flesh are eaten by fierce sentinel dwarfs. The fairy-\nlike Apsaras are wooed by Indra\'s favoured warriors as well as by the gods.\n\nOne of the conditions which secured entry to the heaven of Yama was that a man\nshould have offspring. A rishi, named Mandapala, devoted himself to religious\nvows and the observance of great austerities, but when he reached the region\nof the Pitris, he could not obtain "the fruit of his acts". He asked: "Why is\nthis domain unattainable to me?"\n\nSaid the Celestials: "Because thou hast no children. . . . The Vedas have\ndeclared that the son rescueth the father from a hell called Put. O best of\nBrahmans, strive thou to beget offspring." 1\n\nA father could only reach Heaven if his son, after performing the cremation\nceremony, poured forth the\n\np. 60\n\noblation and performed other necessary services to the dead. Consequently, all\nmen showed great anxiety to have sons. In the Vedic period the exposure of\nfemale children was not unknown; indeed, this practice is referred to in the\n_Yajurveda_. "It is sorrowful to have a daughter," exclaims the writer of one\nof the _Brahmanas_.\n\nOne reason for infanticide in modern India is associated with the practice of\nexogamy (marriage outside of one\'s tribe). Raids took place for the purpose of\nobtaining wives and these were invariably the cause of much bloodshed. In\n1842, members of the Kandhs tribe told Major Macpherson "that it was better to\ndestroy girls in their infancy than to allow them to grow up and become causes\nof strife afterwards". Colonel Mac Culloch, Political Agent for Manipur,\nstamped out infanticide in the Naga country by assuring the people of a tribe\nthat they would be protected against the wife-hunting parties of a stronger\ntribe. "Many years afterwards a troop of Naga girls from the weaker tribe paid\na visit of ceremony to Colonel Mac Culloch, bearing presents of cloth of their\nown weaving in token of their gratitude to the man who had saved their lives."\n1\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[38:1](iml08.htm#fr_94) _Iliad_ , xxiii, 75.\n\n[39:1](iml08.htm#fr_95) Muir, _Original Sanskrit Texts_ , v. 302.\n\n[39:2](iml08.htm#fr_96) _Rigveda_ , x. 51 (Arnold\'s translation).\n\n[39:3](iml08.htm#fr_97) _A History of Sanskrit Literature_ , p. 117.\n\n[39:4](iml08.htm#fr_98) As was also Manu of a different or later cult.\n\n[40:1](iml08.htm#fr_99) From _Indian Wisdom_.\n\n[40:2](iml08.htm#fr_100) _A History of Sanskrit Literature_ , p. 117.\n\n[40:3](iml08.htm#fr_101) _Early Religious Poetry of Persia_ , Professor J.
