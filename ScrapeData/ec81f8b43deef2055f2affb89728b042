Janamejaya said :-- O Best of Munis! The glory of Cha _nd_ ika has been\nfully described by you. By whom was She worshipped in the ancient times after\nthe reading and hearing of Her three glorious deeds (the killing of Madhu Kai\n_t_ ava, etc.)? Who was it that derived the best effects by worshipping the\nDevi, the Bestower of all desires? When and with whom was She pleased and then\noffered boons? O Ocean of mercy! Kindly narrate fully all these things to me.\nO Brahma _n_ a! Describe to me also the rules how the meditation, worship and\nHoma of the Great Devi are conducted. Suta said :-- \xc2\x93O Ri _s_ is! Kri _sn_ a\nDvaipayana, the son of Satyavati, was very glad to hear these questions of\nJanamejaya and began to describe how the worship, etc., of the Maha Maya, the\nDevi Bhagavati are to be done.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n5-21. Vyasa said :-- O King! In days of yore in Svarochi _s_ a Manvantara\nthere was a king, named Suratha, very liberal-minded and devoted to govern\nwell his subjects. He was truthful, active and energetic, and devoted to his\nGuru; he always served the twice-born and he never used to hold any sexual\nintercourse except with his legal wife. He was generous, not liking to quarrel\nwith anybody, and expert in the science of archery. While he was thus\ngoverning his kingdom, the Mlechchas, the hill tribes, turned out his enemies.\nThey destroyed the city of Kola, became very haughty and turbulent and desired\nto conquer the whole earth by their sheer force. Thus accompanied by the great\nfour-fold army\n\n\n\np. 466\n\n\n\nelephants, chariots, cavalry and infantry they came to conquer the dominion of\nthe King Suratha. A dreadful fight then ensued between the King and the\ndreadful Mlechchas. O King! The Mlechcha forces were not at all numerous\nwhereas the armies of the king were large; still the Mlechchas were lucky to\nwin the battle. The King, defeated, fled to his own city which was a strongly\nfortified place. The good King, wise in statesmanship when he saw that his\nministers had gone over to the enemies\xc2\x92 party, became very anxious and thought\nwhether it was advisable for him to wait for a better opportunity, remaining\nwithin his own extensive city, well guarded by a strong wall and ditch or it\nwould be better to fight on. The King thought also that it would not at all be\nadvisable to consult with his ministers who were, then, under the control of\nhis enemies; what then would he do under the circumstances? Those vicious\nministers could at any time deliver him to the hands of his enemies; what\nwould then happen to him! Those men, that are avaricious, can do anything in\nthis world; therefore it would never be advisable to trust them. The people\nunder the sway of greed commit injury to their fathers, brothers, friends,\nacquaintances, their Gurus and the adored Brahma _n_ as. When the ministers\nhad joined with his enemies, they could well be classed with the vicious; no\ndoubt in this. Never could they be trusted under the above circumstances. Thus\npondering over the matter, the King became absent-minded, and, finding no\nremedy, went out of the city alone, mounted on a horse. The intelligent King,\nhelpless, entered into a dense forest and thought where would he go now?\nKnowing, then, that there was, at a distance of three Yojanas from that place,\na hermitage of the great ascetic the Sumedha Ri _s_ i, the King went there.\n(N.B. :-- A Yojana is a distance measuring four Krosas or eight or nine\nmiles.)\n\n\n\n22-33. O King! That hermitage was more beautiful than even the Heavens; it was\non the bank of a river; various kinds of trees were there; it was frequented\nwith wild animals having no enmity with each other; the whole place was echoed\nwith the sounds of cuckoos. The students were studying and reverberating the\natmosphere with their Vedic chants; hundreds of herds of deers were running\nthere; rice trees had grown there wildly at places and their harvests were\ncollected at places; good flowery trees and others with delicious fruits were\nseen there; at places fragrant smells of oblations of ghee, etc., were coming;\nall these were delighting to any man who went or stayed there. The King\nSuratha was very glad to see that \xc3\x82s\xc2\x92rama; he became fearless and wanted to\nstay there in the hermitage of the Brahmi _n_. Fastening his horse at the root\nof a tree, the King approached humbly to the Ri _s_ i, and saw that the\n\n\n\np. 467\n\n\n\nMuni was seated on a deer skin under the shade of dense Sal trees. He was\npeaceful, lean and thin by tapasya. His stature was straight; and he was\nteaching his disciples and explaining to them the meaning of the Veda\nS\xc2\x92astras.\n\n\n\nHe was void of anger, greed, etc., beyond all the dualities, without any\njealousy, always devoted to the contemplation of his Self, truthful and full\nof peace. Seeing him the King was filled with tears and prostrated before him\nand fell like a stick before him. The Muni, seeing him thus asked him to get\nup and enquired about his welfare. A disciple then at the sign of the Guru,\ngave him a Kus\xc2\x92asan, to take his seat. The King got up and at his permission\ntook his seat on that kus\xc2\x92asan; the the Muni worshipped the King duly by\noffering to him water to wash his feet, and Arghya (an offer of green grass,\nrice, etc). Then the Muni asked him, \xc2\x93Who are you? What for are you come here?\nWhy are you so anxious? Tell frankly all these that are not yet known to me.\nWhat do you want? Speak out your mind. Even if that be impracticable, I will\nno doubt try my best to accomplish your desired ends.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n34-36. The King said :-- \xc2\x93O Muni! I am the King Suratha; defeated by my enemy,\nI have left my kingdom, palace, and wife and have come to your refuge. O\nBrahma _n_ a! I am ready to do whatever you order me; on this surface of the\nearth there is no one but you who can protect me. Now I am very much terrified\nby my enemy; therefore I have come to you. O Muni! You protect those who come\nto seek your refuge; I have now come here to seek your shelter; so save me\nfrom this danger.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n37-38. The Mahar _s_ i said :-- \xc2\x93O King! Stay here without any fear; none of\nyour enemies would be able to enter this hermitage by my power of Tapasya,\neven if they be very powerful. O Best of Kings! You will not be allowed to\nkill any animals here; you will have to sustain yourself on this wild rice,\nroots and fruits, etc., as the rules of the forest living permit.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n39-48. Vyasa said :-- Thus hearing his words, the King began to live there,\nwith all purity and without any fear, on roots and fruits. Once the King,\nwhile taking rest under the shade of a tree, while thinking of various things,\nthought of his own house thus :-- \xc2\x93My enemies have, no doubt acquired my\nkingdom, but they are vicious and wicked, shameless Mlechchas and always\naddicted to sinful deeds; certainly they are tormenting my subjects. My\nelephants and horses are not regularly getting their food and have all become\npowerless; certainly they are suffering very much from my enemies. All the\nservants that were nourished by me before are now all suffering from troubles,\nhaving been subjected by my enemies. The wicked enemies are certainly\nsquandering away my hoarded\n\n\n\np. 468\n\n\n\nwealth to bad immoral purposes, in gambling, drinking and in revelling with\nprostitutes. Those Mlechchas and my ministers are always intent on vicious\nacts; they do not know who are the proper persons to be given charities; so\nthey will no doubt exhaust away my coffers in doing sinful acts.\xc2\x94 While the\nKing was thus meditating, seated at the root of a tree, there came one man of\nthe Vais\xc2\x92ya caste looking very distressed. The King saw and instantly bade him\ntake his seat beside him; then the King asked the Vais\xc2\x92ya :-- \xc2\x93O Noble One! Of\nwhat caste are you? Whence are you coming to this forest? What is your name?\nWhat for you look so pale and distressed? What calamity has befallen to you? O\nGood One! Two persons become friends whenever they speak seven words amongst\nthem; according to this rule I am your friend; tell me, therefore, truly all\nthese things.\xc2\x94\n\n\n\n49\\. Vyasa said :-- The Vais\xc2\x92ya, hearing these words from the King, took his\nseat and felt himself much relieved and thinking that he has met with a saint,\nbegan to speak thus :--\n\n\n\n50-52. O my Friend! I belong to the Vais\xc2\x92ya caste; my name is Samadhi; I was\nrich, never I had any jealousy towards anybody; always I used to speak truth\nand was devoted to religious acts. My wife and sons are very greedy of money\nand are irreligious; so they cut off all their affections and connections with\nme, very difficult to cut though, and have driven me out of the house on the\npretext that I am very miserly. Thus forsaken by my relatives, I have now come\nto this forest. You look to be a fortunate man; therefore kindly, O Dear One!\ngive me now your introduction and oblige.\n\n\n\n53-55. The King said :-- I am the King Suratha; lately I had a defeat from the\ndacoits; moreover my ministers deceived me; consequently I am deprived of my\nkingdom and have now come here. O Best of Vais\xc2\x92yas! Fortunately you have come\nto me today as my friend. We two will repose here gladly in this beautiful\nforest covered with trees. O Intelligent One! Now quit your sorrow; be calm\nand quiet and rest with me, at your leisure, here happily.\n\n\n\n56-58. The Vais\xc2\x92ya said :-- O King! My friends and relatives must have been\nhelpless, very sorrowful and they are distressed at my absence; they must have\nbeen troubled very much by diseases and misfortunes no doubt and have become\nvery anxious. O King! I cannot remain quiet; my mind is being troubled with\nthe thought how my wife and sons are spending their times now in pain or\nhappiness? I am always thinking when I would see again my sons, wife,\nrelatives, friends, acquaintances and my house? I cannot make me calm and\nquiet.\n\n\n\np. 469\n\n\n\n59-60. The King said :-- O Intelligent One! What pleasure can you expect to\nsee your wicked sons and treacherous relatives who have driven you out of your\nhouse? Even the enemies are far better, provided they do good to us; what\nsorts of friends are they who impose on us afflictions and sorrows. Do you,\ntherefore, make your mind calm and quiet and remain here in greatest peace and\nhappiness.\n\n\n\n61\\. The Vais\xc2\x92ya said :-- O King! Even those that are wicked and cruel cannot\nquit their relatives. Today my mind is greatly agitated with the thought of my\nrelatives; I cannot remain quiet.\n\n\n\n62\\. The King said :-- My mind too, is incessantly troubled with the thought\nof my kingdom. Come; let both of us go to the Muni and ask him what is the\nmedicine for the cure of these our mental agonies.\n\n\n\n63-64. Vyasa said :-- O King! Thus making their determinations, they went\nhumbly to the Muni to ask him what were the causes of their sorrows? The King\nthen went close to him and bowing down before him, took his seat and began to\nask calmly and quietly the Muni who was sitting calm and serene.\n\n\n\nHere ends the Thirty-second Chapter of the Fifth Book on the King Suratha\xc2\x92s\ngoing to the forest in the Mahapura _n_ am, S\xc2\x92ri Mad Devi Bhagavatam of 18,000\nverses by Mahar _s_ i Veda Vyasa.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: Chapter 33](bk05ch33.htm)\n\n'
