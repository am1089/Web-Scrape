(If there be assumed) the (dyad of) aggregates with its two causes,\n(there takes place) non-establishment of those (two aggregates).\n\nThe reasons on account of which the doctrine of the\n\np. 401\n\n[paragraph continues] Vai _s_ eshikas cannot be accepted have been stated\nabove. That doctrine may be called semi-destructive (or semi-nihilistic  1).\nThat the more thorough doctrine which teaches universal non-permanency is even\nless worthy of being taken into consideration, we now proceed to show.\n\nThat doctrine is presented in a variety of forms, due either to the difference\nof the views (maintained by Buddha at different times), or else to the\ndifference of capacity on the part of the disciples (of Buddha). Three\nprincipal opinions may, however, be distinguished; the opinion of those who\nmaintain the reality of everything (Realists, sarvastitvavadin); the opinion\nof those who maintain that thought only is real (Idealists, vi _g \xc3\xb1_anavadin);\nand the opinion of those who maintain that everything is void (unreal;\nNihilists, _s_ unyavadin 2).--We first controvert those\n\np. 402\n\nwho maintain that everything, external as well as internal, is real. What is\nexternal is either element (bhuta) or elementary (bhautika); what is internal\nis either mind ( _k_ itta) or mental ( _k_ aitta). The elements are earth,\nwater, and so on; elemental are colour, &c. on the one hand, and the eye and\nthe other sense-organs on the other hand. Earth and the other three elements\narise from the aggregation of the four different kinds of atoms; the atoms of\nearth being hard, those of water viscid, those of fire hot, those of air\nmobile.--The inward world consists of the five so-called 'groups' (skandha),\nthe group of sensation (rupaskandha), the group of knowledge (vi _g\n\xc3\xb1_anaskandha), the group of feeling (vedanaskandha), the group of verbal\nknowledge (sam _g \xc3\xb1_askandha), and the group of impressions (sa _m_\nskaraskandha) 1; which\n\np. 403\n\ntaken together constitute the basis of all personal existence  1.\n\nWith reference to this doctrine we make the following remarks.--Those two\naggregates, constituting two different classes, and having two different\ncauses which the Bauddhas assume, viz. the aggregate of the elements and\nelementary things whose cause the atoms are, and the aggregate of the five\nskandhas whose cause the skandhas are, cannot, on Bauddha principles, be\nestablished, i.e. it cannot be explained how the aggregates are brought about.\nFor the parts constituting the (material) aggregates are devoid of\nintelligence, and the kindling (abhi _g_ valana) of intelligence depends on an\naggregate of atoms having been brought about previously 2. And the Bauddhas do\nnot admit any other permanent intelligent being, such as either an enjoying\nsoul or a ruling Lord, which could effect the aggregation of the atoms. Nor\ncan the atoms and skandhas be assumed to enter on activity on their own\naccount; for that would imply their never ceasing to be active 3. Nor can the\ncause of aggregation be looked for in the so-called abode (i.e. the alayavi _g\n\xc3\xb1_ana-pravaha, the train of self-cognitions); for the latter must be described\neither as different from the single cognitions or as not different from them.\n(In the former case it is either permanent, and then it is nothing else but\nthe permanent soul of the Vedantins; or non-permanent;) then being admitted to\nbe momentary merely, it cannot exercise any influence and cannot therefore be\nthe cause of the motion of the atoms 4.\n\np. 404\n\n[paragraph continues] (And in the latter case we are not further advanced than\nbefore.)--For all these reasons the formation of aggregates cannot be\naccounted for. But without aggregates there would be an end of the stream of\nmundane existence which presupposes those aggregates.\n\n* * *\n\n### Footnotes\n\n[401:1](sbe34194.htm#fr_387) Because according to their opinion difference of\nsize constitutes difference of substance, so that the continuous change of\nsize in animal bodies, for instance, involves the continual perishing of old\nand the continual origination of new substances.\n\n[401:2](sbe34194.htm#fr_388) The following notes on Bauddha doctrines are\ntaken exclusively from the commentaries on the _S_ a _n_ karabhashya, and no\nattempt has been made to contrast or reconcile the Brahminical accounts of\nBauddha psychology with the teaching of genuine Bauddha books.

Their\nobjects likewise are classed as _k_ aittika in so far as they are perceived by\nthe senses.--The vi _g \xc3\xb1_anaskandha comprises the series of self-cognitions\n(ahamaham ity alayav _g \xc3\xb1_anapravaha _h_ ), according to all commentators; and\nin addition, according to the Brahmavidyabhara _n_ a, the knowledge,\ndeterminate and indeterminate, of external things (savikalpaka _m_\nnirvikalpaka _m_ _k_ a prav _ri_ ttivi _g \xc3\xb1_anasam _g \xc3\xb1_itam).--The\nvedanaskandha comprises pleasure, pain, &c.--The sam _g \xc3\xb1_askandha comprises\nthe cognition of things by their names (gaur a _s_ va ityadi _s_ abdasam _g_\nalpitapratyaya _h_ , \xc3\x82n.

The sa _m_ skaraskandha\ncomprises passion, aversion, &c., dharma and adharma.--Compare also the\nBhamati.--The vi _g \xc3\xb1_anaskandha is _k_ itta, the other skandhas _k_ aitta.\n\n[403:1](sbe34194.htm#fr_390) It has to be kept in view that the\nsarvastitvavadins as well as the other Bauddha sects teach the momentariness\n(ksha _n_ ikatva), the eternal flux of everything that exists, and are on that\nground controverted by the upholders of the permanent Brahman.\n\n[403:2](sbe34194.htm#fr_391) Mind, on the Bauddha doctrine, presupposes the\nexistence of an aggregate of atoms, viz. the body.\n\n[403:3](sbe34194.htm#fr_392) In consequence of which no release could take\nplace.\n\n[403:4](sbe34194.htm#fr_393) The Brahmavidyabhara _n_ a explains the last\nclause--from ksha _n_ ikatva _k_ _k_ a--somewhat differently: Api _k_ a parama\n_n_ unam api ksha _n_ ikatvabhyupagaman melana _m_ na sambhavati, parama _n_\nuna _m_ melana _m_ parama _n_ ukriyadhinam, tatha _k_ a svakriya _m_ prati\nparama _n_ una _m_ kara _n_ atvat kriyapuraksha _n_ e parama _n_ ubhir bhavyam\nkriya p. 404 _s_ rayataya kriyaksha _n_ e#pi tesham avasthanam apekshitam eva\n_m_ melanakshane#pi, nahi melana _s_ rayasyabhave melanarupa prav _ri_ ttir\nupapadyate, tatha _k_ a sthiraparama _n_ usadhya melanarupa prav _ri_ tti _h_\nkatha _m_ tesham ksha _n_ ikatve bhavet.--\xc3\x82nanda Giri also divides and\ntranslates differently from the translation in the text.\n\n* * *\n\n[Next: II, 2, 19](sbe34195.htm)\n\n"
